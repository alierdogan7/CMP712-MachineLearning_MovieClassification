1
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:26,498
What's that?

2
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,912
Ah, it's nothin'.

3
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:29,182
Does Jenny know?

4
00:00:29,302 --> 00:00:31,365
I'm the man of my house, Tom.

5
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:33,978
I don't have to hide things
from my wife.

6
00:00:34,074 --> 00:00:35,417
I won't tell her.

7
00:00:36,616 --> 00:00:37,815
I appreciate it.

8
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:43,856
Try this.

9
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,912
The nicotine's not your problem.
It's your oral fixation.

10
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:48,775
You just need
something else to suck on.

11
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:50,629
I read it in some magazine.

12
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:52,091
What kind of magazines
you been reading?

13
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:52,926
Easy.

14
00:00:56,599 --> 00:00:59,125
A man's gotta be able
to have something of his own.

15
00:01:04,846 --> 00:01:06,477
How many shooters you count?

16
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:08,586
Five, six.

17
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:11,942
Somebody tipped them off.

18
00:01:11,943 --> 00:01:14,916
All I know is we just lost
two whole fucking years of work.

19
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,889
Want to take a look?

20
00:01:24,027 --> 00:01:28,247
As long as it's just a look. On three.

21
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:29,781
Three.

22
00:02:29,838 --> 00:02:31,710
Son of a bitch.

23
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,803
Hey Tom. Backup's on its way.

24
00:02:34,995 --> 00:02:36,410
FBI! Freeze! Tom!

25
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,776
Jesus Christ!

26
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:03,478
Don't jump off!

27
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:38,962
No!

28
00:03:44,428 --> 00:03:46,346
John! You all right?

29
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:47,401
Yeah.

30
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,895
Come on.

31
00:03:56,992 --> 00:03:57,831
Did you get him?

32
00:03:57,951 --> 00:03:59,677
I got him.

33
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:00,944
You sure?

34
00:04:01,064 --> 00:04:03,225
He took one in the face.
He's dead. Relax.

35
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:06,294
Hey, the morgue's full of people who
thought they got that son of a bitch.

36
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,843
What are you talking about, John?
You sound like you know this guy.

37
00:04:10,034 --> 00:04:12,048
Yeah, but there's talk the Yakuza

38
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,997
hired a rogue independent contractor
to deal with the Triads.

39
00:04:15,117 --> 00:04:16,843
He's supposed to be the best.

40
00:04:16,963 --> 00:04:19,241
The same guy the CIA used
in Jakarta that time.

41
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:19,997
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42
00:04:20,117 --> 00:04:23,365
The same guy that turned on his
handlers and then killed three agents.

43
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:24,899
I heard it was five.

44
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:27,393
That's a bullshit story, John.
You know that, all right?

45
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:29,023
The Rogue's a phantom; he's a myth.

46
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:30,845
Somebody at the Agency's
yanking your chain.

47
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,835
Titanium shells.
The penetrating bullets.

48
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:34,461
It was his signature.

49
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:41,107
You really think
Rogue was working for Yakuza?

50
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:43,313
That's the trouble with this business.

51
00:04:44,272 --> 00:04:46,286
You never know who's working for who.

52
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,865
This is the San Francisco Police.

53
00:04:50,985 --> 00:04:53,553
Remain where you are
with your hands in the air.

54
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:13,402
Yeah, he's right here,
he's right here, John.

55
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,207
Hang... yeah, see you soon.
Okay. Bye-bye.

56
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:22,441
[In Chinese] You tell him that
he cannot smoke in front of the kids.

57
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:25,869
If he's going to smoke
he can do it in the yard.

58
00:05:25,989 --> 00:05:26,852
Okay.

59
00:05:27,811 --> 00:05:29,058
Okay.

60
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:30,664
I thought he was quitting it.

61
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:32,000
I thought he was, too.

62
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,118
Yo, Tom.

63
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:33,733
I gotcha!

64
00:05:33,853 --> 00:05:35,172
Uh, Daniel, please.

65
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,210
- Danny, Danny. I'm on the phone.
- Daniel, come on. Come on.

66
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,403
You'd better be on the road.
Game starts in thirty.

67
00:05:39,523 --> 00:05:41,621
I'm running a little behind.

68
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:44,594
Figure if we don't hit traffic,
we'll make it up there by half-time.

69
00:05:44,714 --> 00:05:45,624
John.

70
00:05:47,103 --> 00:05:48,598
It's an oral fixation.

71
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:52,362
Ecch! Hey. Come on.
Get your coat.

72
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,431
So uh, how's the case going?

73
00:05:55,551 --> 00:05:58,284
Look forget about the case.
Enjoy your sick leave.

74
00:05:58,404 --> 00:05:59,747
Any ideas who blew the op?

75
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:02,574
No. Investigation's underway.
So far... zip.

76
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:03,847
Somebody talked.

77
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:06,364
Somebody inside. Close to us.

78
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:08,236
Any word on what happened to Rogue?

79
00:06:08,356 --> 00:06:09,425
No, we never found a body.

80
00:06:09,545 --> 00:06:11,254
They dragged that bay
for three days and nothing.

81
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:13,749
And he's fish food by now.

82
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:14,994
Okay.

83
00:06:14,995 --> 00:06:16,818
Well, it's game day, right?

84
00:06:16,938 --> 00:06:17,944
Yeah, I know it's game day.

85
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:19,958
Just tell me you haven't
forgot the steaks, okay?

86
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:22,955
No, asshole,
I didn't forget the steaks.

87
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:24,658
Christ, when are you
going to let that go?

88
00:06:24,778 --> 00:06:25,699
Diane asked me to check.

89
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:26,767
You know she also asked me to...

90
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:31,107
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard.
No smoking in front of the kids.

91
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,149
Honey, we got to stop off
and get some steaks.

92
00:07:06,432 --> 00:07:08,028
Diane, they here yet?

93
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:12,249
Please.

94
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,606
Diane, what was that?

95
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,236
Diane.

96
00:07:22,573 --> 00:07:25,484
Oh please!

97
00:07:29,128 --> 00:07:31,238
Don't! No!

98
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:33,732
No!

99
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:43,322
John. John! Honey.

100
00:07:43,514 --> 00:07:44,760
Honey. Honey.

101
00:07:48,596 --> 00:07:49,843
Oh, my God!

102
00:07:57,995 --> 00:07:59,433
Stay with Daniel, honey.

103
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:07,657
Hey, where do you
think you're going?

104
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:08,712
What the hell happened?

105
00:08:08,832 --> 00:08:10,625
I'm gonna have to...

106
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:12,046
We got three fatalities.

107
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:12,932
What?

108
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:16,025
One male, one female, and one child.

109
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,861
Hey, wait a minute, pal. FBI or not...

110
00:09:21,347 --> 00:09:26,817
Sir, CSI needs to finish.
We gotta let them do their thing.

111
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:32,651
Sir? You gotta clear out of here now.

112
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,722
SAN FRANCISCO
THREE YEARS LATER

113
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,997
CLUB ZERO
YAKUZA DISTRICT

114
00:11:09,704 --> 00:11:11,527
Hey, baby. How're you doing?

115
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:19,047
[In Japanese] Get him!

116
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:33,523
Kimo!

117
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:43,114
Kimo!

118
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:54,238
Daito, heel

119
00:12:57,841 --> 00:12:59,417
What the fuck!

120
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:23,968
Rogue do you know
what Shiro does to traitors?

121
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,980
Wow! These Japs sure
know how to party, huh?

122
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,978
Yeah. Smells like a deli in here.

123
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:37,509
Oh, shut up, Gleason.

124
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:39,096
You see all this ink?

125
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:40,739
Japanese Yakuza.

126
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:41,901
Each one of those rings...

127
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,755
is supposed to represent
some poor bastard they've killed.

128
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,268
These are some
bad ass characters here.

129
00:13:47,388 --> 00:13:50,545
Yep. What's that make the people
who did this to them?

130
00:13:50,665 --> 00:13:51,972
Make a hole.

131
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:55,306
Get these people out of here.

132
00:13:55,426 --> 00:13:56,384
And just who the hell are you?

133
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:57,824
Asian Organized Crime Unit.

134
00:13:57,944 --> 00:13:58,920
We'll be taking over from here.

135
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,075
On whose authority?

136
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:01,295
Mayor. President.

137
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:02,810
Take your pick.

138
00:14:04,153 --> 00:14:06,313
- You don't look very Asian to me.

139
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:09,741
You know, I'm amazed you two don't have
this whole case wrapped up by now.

140
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:11,264
Check these yet, Einstein?

141
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,264
Yeah. Someone cut the feeds.
There's nothing on there.

142
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:16,695
Agent Crawford found these
in the back room.

143
00:14:19,018 --> 00:14:20,840
We found him hiding
underneath one of the dead bodies.

144
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:22,279
He's in pretty bad shape.

145
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,789
Yeah, what's he been saying?

146
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:25,252
You're kidding me, right?

147
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:27,074
Who can understand that shit?

148
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,088
Some people come into this country...

149
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:31,581
you'd think they'd at least
learn to speak American.

150
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:33,379
You'd think a couple of cops
working a district...

151
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:37,172
that's crawling with Yakuza
might learn to speak a little Japanese.

152
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:39,604
[In Japanese] If they weren't complete fucking idiots.

153
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,413
Give me a minute here would you?

154
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:51,050
<i>Hi. I'm a cop. What happened here?</i>

155
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,845
<i>Know what I do when I'm not a cop?
I play doctor.</i>

156
00:14:58,338 --> 00:15:00,448
Hey! You can't do that.

157
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,284
<i>If I don't get this shrapnel out</i>

158
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:06,106
<i>it will get infected.</i>

159
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:14,162
<i>I got it. No, it's a bone. Sorry.</i>

160
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:17,902
<i>If you want me
to go back to my day job...</i>

161
00:15:17,998 --> 00:15:20,012
<i>Give me something to do!</i>

162
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:27,301
<i>I want to die before he comes back.</i>

163
00:15:33,822 --> 00:15:34,589
Well...

164
00:15:35,013 --> 00:15:37,730
I can see it's gonna be
a real picnic working with you.

165
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,672
You're not working with me.

166
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:42,645
This is the FBI's case now.

167
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,810
You want to help,
take my shirts to the cleaners.

168
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:50,509
So what'd he say?

169
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,907
Ah, a bunch of
Japanese mumbo jumbo.

170
00:15:53,003 --> 00:15:54,345
Vengeful spirits.

171
00:15:59,716 --> 00:16:00,579
Ghost stories

172
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,873
Jen?

173
00:16:49,969 --> 00:16:51,503
Yeah, did I wake you?

174
00:16:51,599 --> 00:16:53,230
It's almost nine.

175
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,819
Oh, no,
I was working late last night, that's all.

176
00:16:56,011 --> 00:16:57,641
Oh, well, I just called to remind you

177
00:16:57,737 --> 00:17:00,998
that it's Daniel's first
basketball game this Friday.

178
00:17:01,118 --> 00:17:02,820
You forgot, didn't you?

179
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,637
No.

180
00:17:04,642 --> 00:17:05,889
- I've just been tied up with work.
- See ya.

181
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:07,874
I've got a lot on my mind right now.

182
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,533
Yeah, so what's it this time?

183
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:10,876
I've found him, Jen.

184
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:12,217
Found who?

185
00:17:12,337 --> 00:17:14,040
The guy who killed Tom.

186
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:16,347
He's back.

187
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:17,596
I can feel it.

188
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,887
This time I'm taking him down.

189
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:22,576
John, it's been three years.

190
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:25,645
Look, your obsession with
this man has cost you our marriage.

191
00:17:25,741 --> 00:17:28,426
Don't lose your son.

192
00:17:28,522 --> 00:17:29,960
Tell Daniel I'll be there.

193
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:31,915
No, you tell him!

194
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:34,180
And if you say you're gonna be there,
then be there.

195
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:01,416
Those of you who didn't get to meet
last night, this is Agent Goi.

196
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:03,238
Just graduated Quantico.

197
00:18:05,143 --> 00:18:06,204
What's his specs?

198
00:18:06,324 --> 00:18:07,199
Oxford.

199
00:18:08,513 --> 00:18:10,326
What's so funny?

200
00:18:10,446 --> 00:18:12,402
In otherwords, you're a spectator.

201
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:13,284
What about you?

202
00:18:13,404 --> 00:18:14,205
D.T.

203
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,229
Defensive Tactics.

204
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:17,140
That's right.

205
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,980
I like to get up close and personal.

206
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,172
Yeah, well, my gun's bigger than yours.

207
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:22,722
Pick a desk.

208
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:25,584
Still getting set up here ourselves.

209
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:27,694
The back of the bus.

210
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:31,338
These are all the photos
anybody has of Rogue.

211
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:34,599
Bastard re-cuts his face
every six months.

212
00:18:34,886 --> 00:18:38,435
Come on, John, anybody can use
titanium shells and DU bullets.

213
00:18:38,642 --> 00:18:39,298
The ones we found-

214
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:43,326
The ones we found last night matched
the ones we found three years ago.

215
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,491
Rogue's back.

216
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:51,286
Okay, but if he works for the Yakuza
why would he kill Yakuza?

217
00:18:51,477 --> 00:18:52,988
Maybe he switched sides.

218
00:18:53,108 --> 00:18:54,067
Wouldn't be the first time.

219
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:57,016
What sides are we talking about?

220
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,051
Shiro Yanagawa.

221
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,145
Fronts all Yakuza activity from Japan.

222
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,274
Probably the most
powerful man in San Francisco

223
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:06,534
and yet he's never even
set foot on American soil.

224
00:19:06,654 --> 00:19:09,195
He's half the reason this task force
was put together.

225
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,658
Li Chang is the other half.

226
00:19:10,778 --> 00:19:12,285
Unlike Shiro, Chang lives here.

227
00:19:12,405 --> 00:19:14,416
Nice big mansion in Marin.

228
00:19:14,536 --> 00:19:16,795
Thinks he's J.D. Rockefeller
or something.

229
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:18,714
He's a Four-Eighty-Nine.

230
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,152
Triad boss.

231
00:19:20,248 --> 00:19:24,276
Into everything. Bribery, extortion,
murder, you name it.

232
00:19:24,468 --> 00:19:26,961
But years ago
Shiro butchered Chang's family.

233
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:28,770
Actually had the balls
to fly over to Hong Kong,

234
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,678
and wipe out the whole fucking clan.

235
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:32,394
He spent the next thirty years
selling every

236
00:19:32,514 --> 00:19:35,017
heirloom in Chang Dynasty
to collectors' museums.

237
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:37,607
All that's left now is a couple of horses.

238
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:40,484
Statuettes. Two of them.
About this big.

239
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,912
Word on the street is that Shiro is
looking for a buyer as we speak.

240
00:19:44,032 --> 00:19:47,384
Chang's loss of honor
means more than his financial loss.

241
00:19:47,504 --> 00:19:49,283
I don't care about the horses.

242
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:52,184
I don't care about blood lines
or ancient family feuds.

243
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:55,349
First time in three years
we got a real shot at getting Rogue.

244
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:59,281
All we have to do, ladies and
gentlemen, is pull the fucking trigger.

245
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:59,028
CHANG MANSION
MARIN COUNTY, CA

246
00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:14,492
She's a very rare breed.

247
00:21:15,715 --> 00:21:19,551
Andalusian. That's my wife, Maria.

248
00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:25,185
In my father's day, such a union
would not have been possible.

249
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,060
But times change. Those of us
who change with it survive.

250
00:21:31,347 --> 00:21:32,210
Come.

251
00:21:33,903 --> 00:21:36,430
I am really impressed, Mr Shaw.

252
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:40,074
Now that you have spilled
the blood of my enemies...

253
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,349
let's drink to our new partnership.

254
00:21:50,336 --> 00:21:51,679
I have to admit...

255
00:21:53,765 --> 00:21:58,200
I was somewhat skeptical when you
first came to me with your proposal.

256
00:22:00,936 --> 00:22:06,543
- By leaving Shiro's service...
- That was a wise move on your part.

257
00:22:06,831 --> 00:22:09,133
But it makes me wonder.

258
00:22:09,253 --> 00:22:14,503
How could one truly trust a man
who has betrayed his master?

259
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:18,435
I have no master.
So I have betrayed no one.

260
00:22:19,894 --> 00:22:25,532
So, tell me...
My horses, they arrive tonight?

261
00:22:28,604 --> 00:22:30,698
It's been thirty years.

262
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:35,391
All this time my family
has lived in shame and dishonor.

263
00:22:35,511 --> 00:22:38,455
All because of Shiro's treachery.

264
00:22:38,575 --> 00:22:41,740
Tonight, I will take back
what was stolen from my family...

265
00:22:41,836 --> 00:22:44,153
and everything
will change from here on.

266
00:22:44,273 --> 00:22:48,069
Shiro's men will protect his
treasure with their lives.

267
00:22:49,975 --> 00:22:53,416
Are you certain you can deliver them?

268
00:22:53,536 --> 00:22:56,029
I said I would.

269
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,427
These two are the Ti brothers.

270
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:00,633
They will give you everything you need.

271
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:04,756
I'll be in touch.

272
00:23:14,634 --> 00:23:16,073
Watch him closely.

273
00:23:17,991 --> 00:23:20,197
SHIRO'S ESTATE
YAKUZA COMPOUND

274
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:22,402
TO-DAI, JAPAN

275
00:23:49,492 --> 00:23:51,182
[In Japanese] I beg your forgiveness.

276
00:23:56,256 --> 00:23:58,917
The fault is not yours, but mine.

277
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,859
I left myself unguarded.

278
00:24:16,072 --> 00:24:18,218
I trust you have
news from San Francisco...

279
00:24:18,338 --> 00:24:21,670
Yes, everything is
proceeding as requested.

280
00:24:21,862 --> 00:24:22,725
...and the Horses?

281
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:24,164
We've shipped them out.

282
00:24:24,284 --> 00:24:27,233
They will arrive
in San Francisco tonight.

283
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:30,589
You must return to San Francisco
in advance of my arrival.

284
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:32,699
But, Father...

285
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:36,799
I don't trust our people there.

286
00:24:37,054 --> 00:24:39,988
They have become
too lazy to be useful.

287
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:45,454
I was hoping to stay here
and further my role in the clan.

288
00:24:45,845 --> 00:24:50,345
Nothing in the history of our clan
has ever been more important.

289
00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:52,743
I will not fail you.

290
00:24:52,956 --> 00:24:56,003
Go now.
Oversee the sale of the Horses.

291
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:07,416
CHINA TOWN
SAN FRANCISCO

292
00:25:26,117 --> 00:25:28,035
Hey, what's up, dude?

293
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:29,953
I need to see Benny.

294
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:31,487
No Bennys here.

295
00:25:41,461 --> 00:25:42,420
Again!

296
00:25:44,338 --> 00:25:45,489
What are you doing?

297
00:25:46,065 --> 00:25:47,503
No!

298
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:48,270
Yeah!

299
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:49,901
Again!

300
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,778
Come one. Oww! Ooh!

301
00:25:52,874 --> 00:25:53,929
Hey, babe.

302
00:25:58,053 --> 00:25:59,491
We need to talk.

303
00:25:59,611 --> 00:26:02,080
Cabron, I don't talk to the Feds.

304
00:26:02,176 --> 00:26:03,327
Go!

305
00:26:04,478 --> 00:26:06,108
Somewhere private.

306
00:26:06,971 --> 00:26:07,739
Now.

307
00:26:09,465 --> 00:26:10,808
Okay.

308
00:26:13,493 --> 00:26:15,986
My guy's losing anyway, so...

309
00:26:22,987 --> 00:26:25,001
I'm paying for this shit. Come on!

310
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,014
Business is good, I see.

311
00:26:39,134 --> 00:26:41,762
Yeah. So much
for Homeland Security, right?

312
00:26:41,882 --> 00:26:43,234
So how's the family?

313
00:26:43,354 --> 00:26:46,231
Daniel's fine. But Jen.

314
00:26:46,423 --> 00:26:47,861
That's another story.

315
00:26:47,957 --> 00:26:50,642
Yeah, I really like her. I mean,
how could you fuck that up?

316
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:52,728
Well, it wasn't hard.

317
00:26:52,962 --> 00:26:55,725
By the way, thanks for that out there.

318
00:26:55,956 --> 00:26:56,756
Made me look good.

319
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:59,274
Well, hope it helps.

320
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:00,520
Yeah, well, the people I'm tracking,

321
00:27:00,616 --> 00:27:03,206
they expect the FBI
to pay me some visits like this.

322
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:04,451
Makes me look legit.

323
00:27:04,571 --> 00:27:06,179
Was that in the Interpol handbook?

324
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,823
Come on, John, there no science
to catching crooks you know that.

325
00:27:10,015 --> 00:27:11,429
Yeah. You said
you had something for me.

326
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:12,412
Yeah.

327
00:27:15,193 --> 00:27:16,632
Our friend over in Brussels,

328
00:27:16,824 --> 00:27:19,221
the guy that makes
those titanium bullets

329
00:27:20,852 --> 00:27:22,746
found him two days ago.

330
00:27:22,866 --> 00:27:23,729
Then I ran a check.

331
00:27:23,825 --> 00:27:27,757
It seems everyone associated
with Rogue is having some bad luck.

332
00:27:30,592 --> 00:27:31,952
Just last week...

333
00:27:32,072 --> 00:27:34,828
plastic surgeon down in Panama
accidentally impaled himself...

334
00:27:34,948 --> 00:27:37,922
with a kitchen knife
making a turkey sandwich.

335
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:41,063
Week before that another one of our
scalpel friends down in Florida

336
00:27:41,183 --> 00:27:43,844
went skinny-dipping with some gators.

337
00:27:43,964 --> 00:27:47,896
Guess he didn't read the signs. Anyway.

338
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:52,499
These guys, they both
specialize in facial reconstruction.

339
00:27:52,787 --> 00:27:54,034
Both of them.

340
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,846
Our man's tying up loose ends.

341
00:27:57,966 --> 00:28:00,364
Yeah, well there's another surgeon
unaccounted for.

342
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:03,336
Think he might be still alive,
maybe hiding out.

343
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,878
You let me know
the second he surfaces.

344
00:28:05,998 --> 00:28:07,460
Right. Thanks Benny.

345
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:18,777
Button up, this isn't a disco.

346
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:23,860
Is that our contact?

347
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,024
Yes my contact.

348
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:34,025
Get rid of him.

349
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,632
He's my brother. He's with me.

350
00:28:35,752 --> 00:28:37,861
Who the fuck does this guy think he is?

351
00:28:42,561 --> 00:28:43,807
Go back to your car.

352
00:28:43,903 --> 00:28:46,205
Wu, please. He's an outsider.

353
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:48,794
Go! Don't make me say it again.

354
00:29:00,015 --> 00:29:02,508
After this is done
you and I are going to talk.

355
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:14,784
The Horses are intact.
Shiro will be pleased.

356
00:29:14,976 --> 00:29:17,949
We will contact you when we get there.

357
00:29:29,265 --> 00:29:31,663
Are the Horses safe with this crew?

358
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:34,732
Of, course, as far as they know
they're just delivering cars.

359
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:16,929
Stay calm and cooperate.

360
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:19,039
It's just a routine check.

361
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,880
I need you out of the car, both of you.

362
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,533
Put your hands where I can see them.

363
00:30:28,653 --> 00:30:31,122
Officer, we're with
Shiro Yanagawa Enterprises.

364
00:30:31,218 --> 00:30:32,464
You are making a huge mistake.

365
00:30:32,465 --> 00:30:33,520
We have made arrangements.

366
00:30:33,616 --> 00:30:34,863
Out of the car!

367
00:30:42,535 --> 00:30:44,069
Do it. Turn around.

368
00:30:46,275 --> 00:30:47,905
We work security.

369
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:50,495
We have licenses to carry firearms.
Call your Captain.

370
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:53,180
- Shut up. Shut up.
- He'll vouch for us.

371
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,112
- Fucking rent a cops.
- Shut up.

372
00:31:02,377 --> 00:31:03,121
Good evening.

373
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:06,127
Captain Andrews,
what the fuck is going on?

374
00:31:06,223 --> 00:31:08,322
What about our arrangement?

375
00:31:08,442 --> 00:31:13,320
Just a little change in plan.
I need my money. Now.

376
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,554
So, we are good to go?

377
00:31:26,746 --> 00:31:28,952
Oh, yeah. You're good to go.

378
00:31:29,048 --> 00:31:33,172
Just wait here for a sec.
Let me and the boys clear out.

379
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:34,035
Let's go.

380
00:31:34,802 --> 00:31:35,569
Do it.

381
00:31:36,912 --> 00:31:38,830
Mr. Chang sends his regards.

382
00:31:38,926 --> 00:31:39,981
No-o-o!

383
00:31:57,723 --> 00:32:00,887
CHANG'S WAREHOUSE 16

384
00:32:42,893 --> 00:32:44,907
Compliments of Mr. Chang.

385
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:22,788
Some serious shit here, brother.

386
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:25,378
Yakuzas. All of them.

387
00:33:25,474 --> 00:33:29,406
All lined up, shot through the back.
Execution-style.

388
00:33:29,597 --> 00:33:33,625
Excuse me, Forensics wants to know if
you're ready for them to come in yet.

389
00:33:40,914 --> 00:33:42,448
It was a heist.

390
00:33:42,725 --> 00:33:43,551
What?

391
00:33:44,654 --> 00:33:47,339
Check the space between these sedans.

392
00:33:48,874 --> 00:33:50,888
These guys were
escorting something big.

393
00:33:51,008 --> 00:33:53,477
Whatever it was,
it must have been important.

394
00:33:56,642 --> 00:33:59,423
These guys were the guard dogs.

395
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,629
But they left their guns in the cars.

396
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:05,753
There's only one thing that would stop
these guys from throwing down.

397
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:07,766
Cops.

398
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:10,068
At least they thought they were cops.

399
00:34:10,164 --> 00:34:13,617
Hold on just a damn minute. Are you
trying to say that cops did this?

400
00:34:15,535 --> 00:34:17,045
If they didn't, they were involved.

401
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:18,987
No fucking way!

402
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:21,577
For all we know
it could have been one of you guys.

403
00:35:03,486 --> 00:35:07,514
I'm assuming that
you know who the fuck I am.

404
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:10,775
You're a bitch for Shiro Yanagawa
aren't you, Captain?

405
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:15,186
You're the one who gives his boys
free passage to smuggle in shit.

406
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:17,776
And you're the one
who sold them out last night.

407
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:20,461
I don't know what you're talking about.

408
00:35:20,653 --> 00:35:21,995
I've never met Yana...

409
00:35:26,503 --> 00:35:27,654
Hey-hey-hey-hey.

410
00:35:27,749 --> 00:35:29,188
This is a Federal matter.

411
00:35:34,942 --> 00:35:38,491
Look at it. Look down the barrel.

412
00:35:38,682 --> 00:35:40,504
Tell me if you see the bullet.

413
00:35:40,696 --> 00:35:42,518
- Can you see it?
- I see it.

414
00:35:44,831 --> 00:35:46,642
He said he'll kill me.

415
00:35:46,738 --> 00:35:48,848
He said he'll kill my family.

416
00:35:48,944 --> 00:35:49,710
Who?

417
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:51,054
Who said that?

418
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,587
I don't know who!

419
00:35:52,588 --> 00:35:54,123
Who?

420
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:57,671
I don't know who. He's with the Triads.

421
00:35:57,767 --> 00:35:59,110
He works forthe Changs.

422
00:35:59,205 --> 00:36:00,250
He knows where I live.

423
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,658
He knows where my kids go to school.

424
00:36:08,412 --> 00:36:10,906
You stupid bastard.

425
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,536
What do you think
Shiro Yanagawa's gonna do

426
00:36:12,632 --> 00:36:14,454
when he finds out you fucked him?

427
00:36:26,316 --> 00:36:28,648
Get a statement. Call the marshals.

428
00:36:28,744 --> 00:36:31,908
Put his family under protective custody.

429
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,826
Down, down, down! Everyone down!

430
00:36:33,922 --> 00:36:35,265
A shooter on the! roof!

431
00:36:39,101 --> 00:36:39,964
Guys!

432
00:36:57,898 --> 00:36:59,228
This is Agent Wick.

433
00:36:59,348 --> 00:37:00,583
I need Chase Squad backup

434
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,885
and an ambulance
to Sloan's Steakhouse. Now!

435
00:37:04,707 --> 00:37:06,050
Hang on, motherfucker.

436
00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:03,016
Nothing!

437
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,386
This motherfucker's out.

438
00:38:24,498 --> 00:38:27,087
YAKUZA HEADQUARTERS
SAN FRANCISCO

439
00:38:27,183 --> 00:38:29,773
The Triads made us look like fools.

440
00:38:29,964 --> 00:38:33,225
Kill. Kill them.

441
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:35,047
Give me the word...

442
00:38:35,143 --> 00:38:37,253
...and I'll make them disappear.

443
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:39,938
Do it. Find them.

444
00:38:40,175 --> 00:38:43,679
I want all the heads
of every one of them.

445
00:38:43,966 --> 00:38:47,802
Nobody told me
you two were in charge now.

446
00:38:47,898 --> 00:38:49,912
Kira-san. Welcome home.

447
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:52,310
Your presence honors us.

448
00:38:52,406 --> 00:38:56,913
And your stupidity insults my father.

449
00:38:57,105 --> 00:38:58,639
We were just discussing...

450
00:39:00,653 --> 00:39:03,530
I've brought word from Shiro directly.

451
00:39:03,626 --> 00:39:05,832
You are to do nothing
until he instructs you to.

452
00:39:06,064 --> 00:39:08,134
The Horses have been stolen!

453
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,244
If we do not strike back...

454
00:39:13,025 --> 00:39:15,710
Are you disobeying my father?

455
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:25,013
Good. I'd like a salad.

456
00:39:28,081 --> 00:39:31,150
I just got off a fourteen hour flight.

457
00:39:31,342 --> 00:39:33,548
I'd like a salad.

458
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,110
Will somebody get me a salad?

459
00:39:39,386 --> 00:39:42,083
What? What kind?

460
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:50,043
Chef. No blue cheese.

461
00:39:50,235 --> 00:39:52,820
No blue cheese.

462
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,071
Takada...

463
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,991
With dressing on the side, please.

464
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:12,772
Hai.

465
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,033
Bitch.

466
00:40:27,062 --> 00:40:27,925
Yeah.

467
00:40:28,308 --> 00:40:30,802
Special Agent Crawford.

468
00:40:30,898 --> 00:40:31,761
Who is this?

469
00:40:31,857 --> 00:40:33,175
A messenger.

470
00:40:33,295 --> 00:40:35,117
A messenger, huh?

471
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:38,090
The police captain in the restaurant,
was he part of your message?

472
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,529
He was a crooked cop.

473
00:40:39,721 --> 00:40:41,639
I just did what you want to do.

474
00:40:41,735 --> 00:40:44,420
What the hell do you know about
what I want, you fuck?

475
00:40:44,516 --> 00:40:47,009
I saw it in your eyes, John.

476
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:49,215
Yeah, what did you see?

477
00:40:49,311 --> 00:40:53,051
Pain. Rage. Loneliness.

478
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,886
I'll tell you what,

479
00:40:57,006 --> 00:40:59,093
why don't we meet at
my shrink's office and discuss it.

480
00:40:59,213 --> 00:41:01,323
You want the stolen shipment?

481
00:41:01,443 --> 00:41:04,464
Warehouse Sixteen. One hour.

482
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,241
CHANG'S WAREHOUSE 16

483
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:24,387
This is the FBI.

484
00:41:24,507 --> 00:41:27,097
Remain where you are and keep
your hands above your heads.

485
00:41:32,755 --> 00:41:34,961
What? Not happy to see us?

486
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:36,975
This is private property.

487
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:39,948
RSVP. We came to party, baby.

488
00:41:44,263 --> 00:41:48,867
Li Chang.
You still pretending to be legit?

489
00:41:49,058 --> 00:41:54,045
Watch your mouth.
You forget who you're talking to here.

490
00:41:58,017 --> 00:41:59,032
Open it.

491
00:42:02,197 --> 00:42:04,499
I said, open it.

492
00:42:05,937 --> 00:42:06,896
Open it!

493
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:22,720
Put your hands
on the back of your head.

494
00:42:25,214 --> 00:42:26,940
Now, motherfucker.

495
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:33,365
Get your fucking hands up.

496
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,246
No weapons. He's clean.

497
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:49,381
Victor Shaw.

498
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,984
So that's what
you call yourself now huh?

499
00:42:54,176 --> 00:42:58,588
Hong Kong passport but
security license out of Tokyo. Fine.

500
00:42:59,956 --> 00:43:02,328
Check the warehouse.
Make sure nothing's hidden.

501
00:43:04,837 --> 00:43:07,099
It's you, isn't it?

502
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:09,617
I remember your eyes.

503
00:43:09,737 --> 00:43:12,302
There's something
real familiar about them.

504
00:43:15,946 --> 00:43:18,919
It's the one thing the surgeons
can't change, can they?

505
00:43:19,111 --> 00:43:20,262
The eyes.

506
00:43:22,276 --> 00:43:25,824
They did a helluva job
on the rest of you, though.

507
00:43:25,944 --> 00:43:28,318
Wouldn't even know
you're the same man.

508
00:43:31,387 --> 00:43:35,510
But you are, aren't you?
I know you are.

509
00:43:41,792 --> 00:43:44,717
So what's the Yakuza hit man doing
working for the Triads?

510
00:43:48,745 --> 00:43:50,567
I know you understand me.

511
00:43:52,773 --> 00:43:54,787
It was you on the phone, wasn't it?

512
00:43:58,431 --> 00:44:00,316
What, don't remember?

513
00:44:00,436 --> 00:44:02,363
Maybe you remember my partner.

514
00:44:04,473 --> 00:44:06,007
You do, don't you?

515
00:44:07,734 --> 00:44:12,049
Remember his name? Tom Lone.

516
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,653
Remember his wife, Diane?

517
00:44:18,187 --> 00:44:20,681
His four-year-old daughter, Amy?

518
00:44:20,872 --> 00:44:22,982
Remember a cabin in the woods.

519
00:44:24,213 --> 00:44:29,983
A cabin that you burned to the ground
with their bodies still inside?

520
00:44:30,271 --> 00:44:31,877
Remember that?

521
00:44:31,997 --> 00:44:33,723
Do you remember that?

522
00:44:35,354 --> 00:44:40,341
Say it. Say it. Say you remember.

523
00:44:41,491 --> 00:44:46,958
Say you fucking remember blowing
my partner's goddamn head off!

524
00:44:47,246 --> 00:44:50,506
You will find only pain,
living in the past.

525
00:44:50,698 --> 00:44:53,096
Crawford, there's nothing here.
He checks out.

526
00:44:53,192 --> 00:44:57,028
It's him, Terry. I fucking know it.

527
00:44:57,278 --> 00:45:02,546
So what if it is? Hm?
Look, right now we got nothing.

528
00:45:03,933 --> 00:45:08,440
Come on, man,
it'll be another day. All right?

529
00:45:08,805 --> 00:45:14,386
But right now we wait.
We play it smart. And we do it right.

530
00:45:22,825 --> 00:45:23,880
Another day.

531
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:29,059
Another day you and I
are going to finish this.

532
00:45:29,251 --> 00:45:30,977
Count on that.

533
00:45:32,512 --> 00:45:33,950
Everyone move out.

534
00:45:46,705 --> 00:45:49,870
How in the world
did you know the FBI were coming?

535
00:45:52,076 --> 00:45:53,778
Experience.

536
00:45:54,163 --> 00:45:57,734
You have impressed me
once again, my friend.

537
00:45:58,114 --> 00:46:02,529
As you see,
the FBI has declared war on us.

538
00:46:02,721 --> 00:46:03,958
Well, fuck them!

539
00:46:04,078 --> 00:46:06,437
I trust you have secured my Horses?

540
00:46:06,557 --> 00:46:08,630
They are safe.

541
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:12,215
I still have a lot of work
for you to do, my friend.

542
00:46:12,335 --> 00:46:15,476
I think you'd better
stay in my house for a while.

543
00:46:15,668 --> 00:46:17,490
Keep an eye on things.

544
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,284
Understood.

545
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:22,573
Oh, Victor.

546
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:27,752
This FBI guy, Crawford, he is trouble.

547
00:46:29,029 --> 00:46:30,341
He's chasing ghosts.

548
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,815
Give me a new one.

549
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:34,308
I said put up a new one now!

550
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,091
Mommy.

551
00:48:16,122 --> 00:48:17,944
Did I scare you?

552
00:48:19,382 --> 00:48:20,221
Where is the mother?

553
00:48:20,341 --> 00:48:22,931
Do you want to play?
We could play tag.

554
00:48:23,506 --> 00:48:24,633
Go find your mother.

555
00:48:24,753 --> 00:48:26,301
I have things to do.

556
00:48:26,421 --> 00:48:27,726
What's that?

557
00:48:31,562 --> 00:48:33,192
Wow! Do it again.

558
00:48:34,343 --> 00:48:35,590
Ana.

559
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:37,604
He's showing me a magic trick.

560
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,618
Why don't you go downstairs
and play for Mommy.

561
00:48:39,714 --> 00:48:41,728
But we were playing.

562
00:48:41,823 --> 00:48:44,029
I know but I'll be downstairs
in just a minute, okay?

563
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:45,180
Bye.

564
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:51,701
I understand you have business here

565
00:48:51,919 --> 00:48:54,182
but I am warning you
to stay away from Ana.

566
00:48:54,302 --> 00:48:57,637
My husband's work and our family
are two separate things.

567
00:48:57,757 --> 00:48:59,757
Do we understand each other?

568
00:48:59,949 --> 00:49:01,579
Yes, Mrs. Chang.

569
00:49:03,018 --> 00:49:03,785
Good.

570
00:49:17,932 --> 00:49:21,527
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

571
00:49:21,647 --> 00:49:24,329
Mr. Chang might think
you're his man right now

572
00:49:26,424 --> 00:49:30,638
but I'm still the one
who looks after things around here.

573
00:49:31,582 --> 00:49:34,570
At every moment
in the world things change.

574
00:49:46,654 --> 00:49:47,996
- TRIAD DISTRICT-
Don't make me say it again!

575
00:49:48,092 --> 00:49:49,817
...he fucking tells me.

576
00:49:49,818 --> 00:49:51,832
- Do you know how much-
- Relax.

577
00:49:54,134 --> 00:49:56,532
What the fuck?

578
00:49:56,628 --> 00:49:57,778
Mother fucker!

579
00:50:05,163 --> 00:50:07,177
Fucking Yakuza. Let's go!

580
00:50:07,273 --> 00:50:08,999
...teach that fucking Jap a lesson.

581
00:50:29,522 --> 00:50:30,673
YAKUZA DISTRICT

582
00:50:33,262 --> 00:50:34,413
Triads are coming!

583
00:50:38,729 --> 00:50:40,367
Triad motherfuckers get 'em!

584
00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:57,142
Buddha-heads!

585
00:51:01,937 --> 00:51:02,992
Fucking Yakuza!

586
00:51:37,229 --> 00:51:38,764
You fucking bastard.

587
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,682
I knew we should
never have trusted you.

588
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:13,577
Subtle, ain't it?

589
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,413
It's got Shiro's trademark.

590
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,563
So what now?

591
00:52:18,659 --> 00:52:20,290
Get ready for a war.

592
00:52:25,756 --> 00:52:28,537
Joey Ti. Got your ass.

593
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:31,319
Park, I want you outside
Chang's place in Marin.

594
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,332
Daniels, you get Yanagawa Motors.

595
00:52:33,524 --> 00:52:35,634
Kinler, you get Warehouse 16.

596
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:38,799
Wick, take Goi.
Keep an eye on the Sayu Teahouse.

597
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:40,309
I get the new guy, huh?

598
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:42,131
I think I know
how to look through a night scope.

599
00:52:42,251 --> 00:52:43,306
Hey, eyes open, everybody.

600
00:52:43,402 --> 00:52:44,456
The shit's gonna go down somewhere.

601
00:52:44,457 --> 00:52:45,896
Be ready to move
when you get the call.

602
00:52:45,992 --> 00:52:48,101
Binoculars. No night scope.

603
00:52:48,197 --> 00:52:51,021
The authorities are
expecting us to retaliate.

604
00:52:51,141 --> 00:52:52,871
We strike now, we risk everything!

605
00:52:52,991 --> 00:52:54,503
What if it was your family?

606
00:52:54,623 --> 00:52:56,613
What the fuck is wrong with you?

607
00:52:56,733 --> 00:53:00,377
You forgot?
Once it was my family.

608
00:53:00,569 --> 00:53:02,775
Joey was like a son to me.

609
00:53:04,117 --> 00:53:06,323
Revenge is a must.

610
00:53:06,515 --> 00:53:08,529
But you've got to learn to be patient.

611
00:53:08,649 --> 00:53:12,940
I will allow nothing
to put our family at risk.

612
00:53:13,132 --> 00:53:15,721
I want you to do nothing.

613
00:53:15,913 --> 00:53:16,968
Is that clear?

614
00:53:33,847 --> 00:53:37,108
Shiro knows his days
are coming to an end.

615
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:40,560
One thing's for sure...

616
00:53:40,656 --> 00:53:44,300
more blood will be spilled
before this is over.

617
00:53:45,739 --> 00:53:46,986
Mr. Shaw...

618
00:53:48,424 --> 00:53:52,644
I want your word that my wife
and daughter will be safe.

619
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,384
No harm will come to them.

620
00:54:06,933 --> 00:54:09,139
A man should never give up his honor.

621
00:54:12,975 --> 00:54:15,085
Or the honor of his family.

622
00:54:22,662 --> 00:54:23,716
Keep them.

623
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:26,018
I don't smoke.

624
00:54:37,335 --> 00:54:39,253
SAYU TEA HOUSE

625
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,418
SAYU TEA HOUSE
YAKUZA DISTRICT

626
00:54:56,323 --> 00:54:57,588
Oh, man!

627
00:54:58,913 --> 00:55:01,118
I didn't know your mama
was working tonight.

628
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,132
Keep your eye on the mark, Goi.

629
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:09,270
Yo, heads up!

630
00:55:11,188 --> 00:55:13,682
Looks like Takada's having
a little tea party, huh?

631
00:55:41,493 --> 00:55:43,124
Have some spicy tuna.

632
00:55:54,344 --> 00:55:55,975
Shit! Get Crawford and call for backup!

633
00:55:56,167 --> 00:55:57,222
It's going down now!

634
00:56:03,455 --> 00:56:04,376
Crawford.

635
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:05,637
We got trouble.

636
00:56:05,757 --> 00:56:07,267
Wu just showed up just like you said.

637
00:56:07,387 --> 00:56:08,249
I'm on my way.

638
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:09,401
Copy that.

639
00:56:32,686 --> 00:56:33,473
Get down!

640
00:56:53,037 --> 00:56:54,475
I'm going in. Cover me.

641
00:57:15,958 --> 00:57:17,396
This is for my brother.

642
00:57:17,588 --> 00:57:19,314
He's dead! Come on!

643
00:57:34,179 --> 00:57:35,234
On three.

644
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:36,385
What?

645
00:57:36,505 --> 00:57:37,224
Three!

646
00:57:37,344 --> 00:57:38,399
Oh! Shit!

647
00:57:46,179 --> 00:57:47,030
Wick!

648
00:57:47,346 --> 00:57:48,079
Shit!

649
00:57:55,182 --> 00:57:56,788
FBI. Drop your weapons.

650
00:57:56,908 --> 00:57:57,747
Drop your weapons!

651
00:57:57,867 --> 00:58:00,167
Hands on the counter
where I can see them.

652
00:58:01,468 --> 00:58:02,238
Closer.

653
00:58:06,594 --> 00:58:09,471
Situation secure.
All units stand down and cease fire.

654
00:58:12,949 --> 00:58:15,130
Damnit, Goi!
He said cease fucking fire!

655
00:58:17,376 --> 00:58:18,071
Shit.

656
00:58:19,253 --> 00:58:21,076
Look. Goi's right there.

657
00:58:21,196 --> 00:58:22,687
We got a shooter guys.

658
00:58:28,076 --> 00:58:29,035
I got him!

659
00:58:36,036 --> 00:58:37,571
Don't fucking move!

660
00:58:43,254 --> 00:58:44,476
Get the other one!

661
00:59:53,334 --> 00:59:54,485
Fuck you!

662
00:59:58,417 --> 01:00:03,404
In Japan! You'd be dead!

663
01:00:07,242 --> 01:00:08,486
This isn't Japan.

664
01:02:25,531 --> 01:02:26,970
I said no. No-no-no.

665
01:02:29,396 --> 01:02:30,422
Yes.

666
01:02:30,518 --> 01:02:34,259
Wu and his boys shot up
Takada's teahouse last night.

667
01:02:34,509 --> 01:02:35,335
What?

668
01:02:36,026 --> 01:02:40,013
Wu Ti? Uh, are you sure?

669
01:02:40,244 --> 01:02:41,258
I tried to stop them.

670
01:02:41,378 --> 01:02:45,767
Goddamnit!
I told him not to do anything.

671
01:02:46,146 --> 01:02:47,685
He leaves me with no choice.

672
01:02:58,042 --> 01:03:02,214
You've done well.
My father is very pleased.

673
01:03:06,093 --> 01:03:08,472
He now asks one more thing of you.

674
01:03:08,592 --> 01:03:12,428
After I kill Chang
his operation will be destroyed.

675
01:03:12,716 --> 01:03:14,538
What more could Shiro want?

676
01:03:17,511 --> 01:03:19,716
The heads of the wife and child.

677
01:03:21,059 --> 01:03:22,018
Why?

678
01:03:23,265 --> 01:03:24,512
That's the order.

679
01:03:24,607 --> 01:03:25,950
There is no why.

680
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:30,266
You never had a problem
killing women and children before.

681
01:03:30,555 --> 01:03:33,622
Would you dare disobey your master?

682
01:03:33,814 --> 01:03:37,171
I have no master.

683
01:03:37,267 --> 01:03:39,376
These are my guards.

684
01:03:39,496 --> 01:03:43,021
They will assist you on this task
as you best decide.

685
01:03:43,369 --> 01:03:44,651
If I refuse?

686
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:55,200
You dropped this.

687
01:04:02,201 --> 01:04:03,999
What is happening, John?

688
01:04:04,119 --> 01:04:06,805
There are men with guns
in my front yard.

689
01:04:06,901 --> 01:04:08,123
Just a precaution.

690
01:04:08,243 --> 01:04:10,353
A precaution? For what?

691
01:04:10,473 --> 01:04:13,038
What've you gotten us into?

692
01:04:13,326 --> 01:04:15,147
Oh, my God.

693
01:04:15,148 --> 01:04:17,546
It's him. Isn't it?
He's coming after us.

694
01:04:17,826 --> 01:04:19,309
That's not gonna happen.

695
01:04:27,424 --> 01:04:29,222
I'm sorry, Jen.

696
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:31,835
Not just for this. For everything.

697
01:04:32,986 --> 01:04:35,480
I tried to do the right thing.

698
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:37,973
Make a good life for you and Daniel.

699
01:04:38,069 --> 01:04:40,179
To give you the things you needed.

700
01:04:40,299 --> 01:04:43,919
It never had anything to do
with what we did or didn't have.

701
01:04:44,111 --> 01:04:45,357
It was the job.

702
01:04:45,453 --> 01:04:47,464
The job always came first, even now.

703
01:04:47,584 --> 01:04:49,673
Even knowing you might be
putting us in the same danger

704
01:04:49,769 --> 01:04:51,591
Tom and his family were in.

705
01:05:01,086 --> 01:05:02,236
You know...

706
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:05,497
I'm not even mad at you anymore.

707
01:05:05,724 --> 01:05:08,254
Most days I just feel sorry for you.

708
01:05:08,374 --> 01:05:10,004
For what you've become.

709
01:05:12,402 --> 01:05:13,457
It's Benny.

710
01:05:14,991 --> 01:05:16,718
Say hi to Benny for me.

711
01:05:25,157 --> 01:05:26,883
What've you got, Benny?

712
01:05:26,979 --> 01:05:29,089
We found your plastic surgeon.

713
01:05:29,209 --> 01:05:30,344
Tijuana, Mexico

714
01:05:48,461 --> 01:05:50,859
Welcome home, Dr. Sherman.

715
01:05:51,051 --> 01:05:52,873
Hey Jefe, what's cooking?

716
01:05:52,969 --> 01:05:54,599
Step in here.

717
01:05:54,695 --> 01:05:56,421
Let's have a talk. Come on.

718
01:06:00,545 --> 01:06:01,696
Agent Crawford, is that?

719
01:06:01,816 --> 01:06:03,039
I don't-I don't-I don't know anything.

720
01:06:03,383 --> 01:06:04,787
Really. I don't know anything.

721
01:06:04,907 --> 01:06:06,083
Come on, you kidding me?

722
01:06:06,203 --> 01:06:07,234
Can you explain to me...

723
01:06:07,354 --> 01:06:09,440
why one of the world's most
brilliant nip-and-tuckers

724
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,166
is hiding out in the slums of Mexico?

725
01:06:11,286 --> 01:06:13,024
What are you,
a fucking Nazi war criminal?

726
01:06:13,144 --> 01:06:13,660
Look, I were you,

727
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:16,465
I'd be lapping up that pussy
on South Beach stretching it out.

728
01:06:16,585 --> 01:06:17,904
Come on, now.

729
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,806
Look, I could give a shit about
whatever laws you've broken.

730
01:06:21,926 --> 01:06:23,945
That's not why we're here.

731
01:06:26,247 --> 01:06:29,028
I need you to identify this man.

732
01:06:29,148 --> 01:06:30,787
You know what happened
to the other two doctors.

733
01:06:30,907 --> 01:06:33,128
We know you could be next.

734
01:06:33,248 --> 01:06:34,303
We can protect you.

735
01:06:34,399 --> 01:06:36,700
You don't know him. Protect me?

736
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:38,523
You can't protect me.
You can't stop him.

737
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:40,920
You found me here,
he can find me here.

738
01:06:43,832 --> 01:06:45,044
I can stop him.

739
01:06:46,572 --> 01:06:50,319
All I need from you is a yes or a no.
Is this Rogue?

740
01:06:56,265 --> 01:06:57,511
Is this Rogue?

741
01:06:58,374 --> 01:07:00,031
We uh, we-we...

742
01:07:00,151 --> 01:07:06,526
We used to get uh, commissioned
by the U.S. government

743
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:11,010
and we'd all do our surgeries on him
when he was with the CIA.

744
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:13,431
We changed his face a lot of times.

745
01:07:15,253 --> 01:07:17,893
He, uh he came to me
three years ago.

746
01:07:18,013 --> 01:07:19,928
His face was almost torn off.

747
01:07:20,048 --> 01:07:20,816
I just did what I could.

748
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:22,638
I repaired the muscle,
the nerve tissue.

749
01:07:22,734 --> 01:07:24,511
Then I reconstructed the facial bones.

750
01:07:24,631 --> 01:07:26,090
I never saw him again.

751
01:07:29,955 --> 01:07:32,516
This is what I made him look like.

752
01:07:36,544 --> 01:07:38,438
Look, Doc,
we're going to take you with us.

753
01:07:38,558 --> 01:07:41,627
We're going to protect you,
understand?

754
01:07:41,747 --> 01:07:45,463
Now why don't you go get
somethings together and we'll go.

755
01:07:45,654 --> 01:07:47,084
Doc!

756
01:07:47,204 --> 01:07:50,546
What? Yeah. Is it okay if l-if I...

757
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,368
Yeah-yeah-yeah. Go ahead.

758
01:08:01,284 --> 01:08:02,725
You believe in fate Benny?

759
01:08:05,111 --> 01:08:05,962
Fate?

760
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,137
Yeah.

761
01:08:07,962 --> 01:08:12,411
You know, no matter what you do
your future's already decided?

762
01:08:12,531 --> 01:08:13,562
I don't know about that.

763
01:08:13,658 --> 01:08:16,343
I always thought your future
depends on what choices you make.

764
01:08:33,989 --> 01:08:36,483
I have made all
the necessary arrangements.

765
01:08:36,603 --> 01:08:38,497
I will join you as soon as I finish here.

766
01:08:38,593 --> 01:08:39,170
Okay?

767
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:40,990
Don't worry.

768
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:43,196
Okay, I'll be back to walk you out.

769
01:08:44,251 --> 01:08:45,402
I love you.

770
01:09:25,585 --> 01:09:26,736
My crew's gone.

771
01:09:28,308 --> 01:09:29,707
My brother is dead.

772
01:09:29,827 --> 01:09:31,303
You brought it onto yourself.

773
01:09:31,423 --> 01:09:33,329
And how did I do that?

774
01:09:33,449 --> 01:09:35,243
I gave you my trust.

775
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:37,189
I gave you my loyalty.

776
01:09:37,285 --> 01:09:41,217
I sacrificed everything for you
and this is how I'm treated?

777
01:09:41,409 --> 01:09:44,682
You've got a lot of nerve
to talk to me about loyalty.

778
01:09:44,802 --> 01:09:46,396
You're a fucking traitor!

779
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:52,726
Die!

780
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:06,344
That piece of shit.
He tells me that he's loyal.

781
01:10:07,033 --> 01:10:08,454
That he's my friend.

782
01:10:09,604 --> 01:10:11,467
I trusted him.

783
01:10:11,587 --> 01:10:15,939
He's right. He was loyal.
He was your friend.

784
01:10:16,059 --> 01:10:16,857
What?

785
01:10:26,963 --> 01:10:27,730
Shit.

786
01:10:28,977 --> 01:10:30,032
AOC base from Clark.

787
01:10:30,128 --> 01:10:32,717
We got some major action
at the Chang mansion.

788
01:10:32,813 --> 01:10:34,731
What's going on? Is the boss okay?

789
01:10:42,978 --> 01:10:44,992
Mommy loves you, okay. Just...

790
01:10:50,488 --> 01:10:51,322
No!

791
01:11:04,752 --> 01:11:06,738
Chang is dead.

792
01:11:06,858 --> 01:11:09,064
And the woman and child?

793
01:11:09,256 --> 01:11:11,270
Take me to the bodies
so I can take their heads.

794
01:11:12,743 --> 01:11:16,736
No. I killed them.
I should have that honor.

795
01:11:25,272 --> 01:11:26,518
Come on! Kill him!

796
01:11:57,399 --> 01:12:02,386
Are you okay? Where is my husband?

797
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:38,541
Where's Clark?

798
01:12:38,637 --> 01:12:39,668
He's on his way back.

799
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:40,843
He send the photos?

800
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:42,090
Yes, sir.

801
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:44,943
What the fuck happened up there?

802
01:12:45,063 --> 01:12:48,323
Looks like Rogue took out Chang and
turned on Shiro's assassins.

803
01:12:48,515 --> 01:12:51,464
He's using them.
Playing both sets against each other.

804
01:12:51,584 --> 01:12:52,735
Why would he do that?

805
01:12:54,444 --> 01:12:57,242
John! You're never gonna believe
who just flew in.

806
01:13:10,564 --> 01:13:14,121
Father, I'm so happy to see you.

807
01:13:14,241 --> 01:13:16,998
And I am happy to see you.

808
01:13:17,118 --> 01:13:19,675
This country looks very beautiful.

809
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:22,273
Your English is improving.

810
01:13:22,465 --> 01:13:23,890
I have been practicing.

811
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:26,013
This is my new home after all.

812
01:13:28,506 --> 01:13:31,012
Rogue insisted on
delivering the Horses himself.

813
01:13:31,132 --> 01:13:33,589
You've made me very proud.

814
01:13:33,685 --> 01:13:36,466
I must ask for one more thing of you.

815
01:13:36,562 --> 01:13:38,289
Anything.

816
01:13:38,384 --> 01:13:39,823
Return to Japan.

817
01:13:41,055 --> 01:13:44,906
But I want to stay with you.

818
01:13:45,098 --> 01:13:47,879
If I am to oversee our expansion here

819
01:13:47,999 --> 01:13:51,044
I need someone
who can insure our interests in Japan.

820
01:13:51,671 --> 01:13:55,314
The only person
I can trust is you, Kira.

821
01:13:55,434 --> 01:13:58,140
Shiro Yanagawa!

822
01:13:58,236 --> 01:14:01,462
FBI Special Agent John Crawford.

823
01:14:01,582 --> 01:14:03,223
Step back

824
01:14:04,662 --> 01:14:06,484
Welcome to America.

825
01:14:06,580 --> 01:14:09,936
Now don't unpack.
You won't be staying long.

826
01:14:10,056 --> 01:14:11,230
Agent Crawford...

827
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:12,909
I'm a busy man.

828
01:14:14,895 --> 01:14:16,626
Oh, we got a lot of business,
you and me.

829
01:14:16,746 --> 01:14:19,335
I think you know that.

830
01:14:19,431 --> 01:14:22,500
Three years ago
Rogue killed my partner and his family.

831
01:14:22,596 --> 01:14:23,459
And you know what?

832
01:14:23,579 --> 01:14:25,377
Rogue was working for you.

833
01:14:26,911 --> 01:14:29,476
Rogue is a myth. Just a rumor.

834
01:14:29,596 --> 01:14:31,288
You think so, huh.

835
01:14:38,132 --> 01:14:40,985
You can't always trust rumors, can you?

836
01:14:41,105 --> 01:14:45,133
Rogue turns around and fucking slices
up the heavy hitters you sent with him.

837
01:14:45,325 --> 01:14:48,585
Now you gotta ask yourself, now
why would he do something like that?

838
01:14:48,681 --> 01:14:50,887
I've never seen this man
before in my life.

839
01:14:55,682 --> 01:14:56,737
Look...

840
01:14:56,857 --> 01:14:59,974
I don't care if you fuckers slaughter
each other till you're all dead and buried.

841
01:15:00,094 --> 01:15:02,203
Truth is it makes my job a lot easier.

842
01:15:02,299 --> 01:15:05,464
But if I find proof that
ties any of this shit back to you...

843
01:15:05,676 --> 01:15:08,155
you ain't never gonna see Japan again.

844
01:15:08,275 --> 01:15:11,122
And neither will that
pretty little daughter of yours.

845
01:15:14,304 --> 01:15:15,656
Thanks for the tip

846
01:15:15,776 --> 01:15:17,068
Agent Crawford.

847
01:16:09,076 --> 01:16:12,476
Finally! My most loyal stranger.

848
01:16:12,596 --> 01:16:14,322
We meet face to face.

849
01:16:22,858 --> 01:16:26,694
Yanagawa-san, I've waited
a long time for this moment.

850
01:16:28,995 --> 01:16:33,503
It's all because of you
that we now have this opportunity.

851
01:16:33,623 --> 01:16:37,339
Kira enjoyed working with you here.

852
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:42,038
One day she'll make a fine leader
of Yanagawa clan.

853
01:16:42,326 --> 01:16:47,888
Yeah, one day.
I'm reminded of the Sengoku...

854
01:16:50,041 --> 01:16:54,218
when the Daimyo warriors fought
each other to unite Japan.

855
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:59,492
The one who finally succeeded was
a man by the name of Oda Nobunaga.

856
01:17:00,539 --> 01:17:03,113
And do you know how he did it?

857
01:17:03,233 --> 01:17:06,277
He killed everyone who opposed him.

858
01:17:06,397 --> 01:17:10,617
Thanks to you all those
who oppose me here are dead.

859
01:17:10,737 --> 01:17:12,823
I exist but to serve you.

860
01:17:26,389 --> 01:17:29,510
In Asia these could never be sold.

861
01:17:30,922 --> 01:17:33,538
But the fortune
they will bring here in the West...

862
01:17:33,658 --> 01:17:37,414
will be more than enough
to continue our American expansion.

863
01:17:37,534 --> 01:17:40,635
And now it is time for your reward.

864
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:41,785
Open it.

865
01:18:01,451 --> 01:18:04,490
One must remove all future threats.

866
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:09,405
You allowed that threat to remain
by not killing the woman and child.

867
01:18:12,987 --> 01:18:17,749
You have disobeyed me
and broken my most sacred code.

868
01:18:18,228 --> 01:18:20,242
Your code, not mine.

869
01:18:22,165 --> 01:18:24,653
Betrayal cannot be forgiven.

870
01:18:26,052 --> 01:18:28,370
Take him downstairs.

871
01:18:28,684 --> 01:18:31,847
Persuade him to tell us
where the wife and child are.

872
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:44,602
They are truly magnificent.

873
01:18:46,232 --> 01:18:49,684
So many dead for such small trinkets.

874
01:18:53,584 --> 01:18:54,767
Fakes!

875
01:20:00,844 --> 01:20:02,163
Find the woman and child...

876
01:20:02,283 --> 01:20:03,913
They'll lead us to the real Horses.

877
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,833
Yanagawa-san!

878
01:20:56,084 --> 01:20:58,865
After all these years...

879
01:20:59,057 --> 01:21:01,527
why do you do this?

880
01:21:01,647 --> 01:21:03,373
You ordered the hit.

881
01:21:05,291 --> 01:21:08,264
I ordered many hits.

882
01:21:10,661 --> 01:21:12,963
This one was different.

883
01:21:54,602 --> 01:21:58,613
You should have left
the wife and daughter alone.

884
01:22:26,365 --> 01:22:28,726
I left none to seek revenge.

885
01:22:35,664 --> 01:22:37,549
You left one!

886
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:07,854
Your assassin, Rogue,
never made it out alive.

887
01:23:16,965 --> 01:23:20,418
So, you are Tom Lone?

888
01:23:21,952 --> 01:23:25,309
Changing your face, your voice.

889
01:23:27,626 --> 01:23:29,912
All so you could get to me.

890
01:23:33,099 --> 01:23:36,721
Pain can be a weapon,
if you so choose.

891
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:46,216
How do you think we found out
you were FBI in the first place?

892
01:23:46,336 --> 01:23:47,654
It was Crawford.

893
01:23:57,628 --> 01:23:59,658
You killed my family.

894
01:23:59,778 --> 01:24:03,574
It was Crawford.
He's the one who gave you up.

895
01:24:07,506 --> 01:24:09,616
Crawford works for me.

896
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:17,863
Because of him your family's dead!

897
01:24:19,935 --> 01:24:21,071
Somebody talked.

898
01:24:21,191 --> 01:24:23,522
From inside. Close to us.

899
01:24:23,905 --> 01:24:25,727
You never know who's working for who.

900
01:24:25,919 --> 01:24:27,070
Somebody talked.

901
01:25:19,243 --> 01:25:20,296
Crawford?

902
01:25:22,467 --> 01:25:23,653
Shiro's dead.

903
01:25:29,336 --> 01:25:31,708
Get out of this business
while you can, Goi.

904
01:26:37,881 --> 01:26:41,334
From America? Leave me.

905
01:27:13,404 --> 01:27:14,228
Crawford.

906
01:27:15,628 --> 01:27:18,040
Remember the night we met?

907
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:20,534
I remember my partner
blowing your face off.

908
01:27:20,654 --> 01:27:24,202
You live today
only because of what he did.

909
01:27:26,321 --> 01:27:29,765
I live today only to kill you,
you miserable prick.

910
01:27:30,458 --> 01:27:32,354
Meet me there.

911
01:27:42,903 --> 01:27:43,766
Goi

912
01:27:54,508 --> 01:27:55,754
Where are you?

913
01:27:56,336 --> 01:27:57,768
Show yourself!

914
01:27:59,847 --> 01:28:03,139
I got your surgeon.
He made a positive ID.

915
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:09,370
Come on, Crawford. Flush him out.

916
01:28:09,901 --> 01:28:11,578
It's over, Rogue.

917
01:28:12,857 --> 01:28:14,551
Can you hear me?

918
01:30:08,819 --> 01:30:10,593
Why did you do it?

919
01:30:11,361 --> 01:30:14,491
What did Shiro promise you
that was worth my life

920
01:30:14,611 --> 01:30:17,115
and the life of Diane and Amy?

921
01:30:26,513 --> 01:30:30,445
No, you're not him. It can't be.

922
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:57,466
You don't even sound like him.

923
01:30:57,586 --> 01:30:59,681
Look at my eyes, John.

924
01:30:59,801 --> 01:31:02,573
The one thing the surgeons
can never change.

925
01:31:35,235 --> 01:31:36,943
Oh, Jesus, Tom.

926
01:31:37,751 --> 01:31:40,046
Is it really you?

927
01:31:40,166 --> 01:31:41,221
Yeah.

928
01:31:42,555 --> 01:31:44,194
Why didn't you tell me?

929
01:31:46,535 --> 01:31:50,044
It was the only way
I could get the man responsible.

930
01:31:50,737 --> 01:31:52,230
But all along...

931
01:31:52,614 --> 01:31:55,990
I never thought it would
bring me back to my best friend.

932
01:31:59,201 --> 01:32:01,333
I didn't know they'd send Rogue.

933
01:32:01,453 --> 01:32:03,673
For Christ sakes,
I thought he was dead!

934
01:32:03,793 --> 01:32:06,156
They said they wanted
to teach you a lesson.

935
01:32:06,276 --> 01:32:10,568
For shooting Rogue.
Just rough you up a bit, that's all.

936
01:32:10,821 --> 01:32:13,572
Is that what they told you?

937
01:32:13,692 --> 01:32:16,034
Shiro ordered everything.

938
01:32:17,193 --> 01:32:22,268
I tried to stop working for him,
to get out, so many times.

939
01:32:24,676 --> 01:32:26,281
I thought if I could make
that son of a bitch

940
01:32:26,401 --> 01:32:30,000
pay for what he did to you, somehow
it would make things right again.

941
01:32:35,406 --> 01:32:37,492
You think you could forgive me, Tom?

942
01:32:37,612 --> 01:32:39,147
Tom Lone is dead.

943
01:32:39,827 --> 01:32:41,448
My name is Rogue.

944
01:32:42,925 --> 01:32:44,033
No...

945
01:32:49,524 --> 01:32:50,463
Shit!
