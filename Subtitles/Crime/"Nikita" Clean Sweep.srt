1
00:00:04,787 --> 00:00:06,457
Previously on <i>Nikita...</i>

2
00:00:06,582 --> 00:00:07,601
I may have a lead on Nikita.

3
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:12,262
Oversight is thinking about
executing "Clean Sweep".

4
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:13,180
What the hell is that?

5
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,891
Years ago,
when Percy created Division,

6
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,851
Oversight insisted
he build in a fail-safe.

7
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:19,269
There's a tanker of VX gas

8
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:20,812
tapped into Division's
ventilation system.

9
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:22,816
20 minutes after Oversight
pulls the trigger,

10
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:24,024
the place will be
a mass grave.

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,275
Why is Oversight doing this?

12
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:27,903
Thanks to you,
Division has become expendable.

13
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,196
You're planning an escape,
which we both know

14
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,947
is impossible.

15
00:00:31,113 --> 00:00:32,542
There is no way out of here.

16
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,242
No way that you can see.

17
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:35,827
But you will.

18
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:36,995
We have to get
out of here, now.

19
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:38,955
On your knees!

20
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:41,333
I take my orders from
the same man I always have.

21
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,019
That's one
of the Guardians.

22
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:44,304
That's why
they were gathering,

23
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:45,837
their target was Oversight.

24
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:47,422
Percy.

25
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:53,512
<font color="#3399FF">Sync and correction by Mlmlte</font>
<font color="#3399FF">www.addic7ed.com</font>

26
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,368
Release Percy, or you eliminate
the members of Oversight.

27
00:00:58,493 --> 00:00:59,843
That's correct.

28
00:01:02,347 --> 00:01:03,480
Sounds good to me.

29
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:05,816
Keep listening.

30
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:08,610
Failure to comply will result

31
00:01:08,776 --> 00:01:11,196
in the activation
of Clean Sweep.

32
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,550
Which means
now it won't take me more

33
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:16,085
than 30 seconds
to launch the program.

34
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:19,996
If you attempt evacuation,
we trigger it immediately.

35
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:21,873
How would they know
if she evac'd?

36
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,583
Roan. Percy's got him
on the inside.

37
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:24,777
Guys, shh.

38
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:26,753
And everyone inside
your facility dies.

39
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:30,674
Percy will give you
instructions for the next step.

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,093
There's a flaw
in your plan.

41
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,803
Really?

42
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:38,474
If Clean Sweep releases
VX gas through the facility,

43
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,843
everyone dies,
including you.

44
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,602
I can live with that.

45
00:01:42,768 --> 00:01:46,332
The captain goes down
with the ship.

46
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,418
Percy's bluffing.

47
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:50,026
He's not.

48
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:51,170
My mother told me
Clean Sweep

49
00:01:51,295 --> 00:01:53,822
could be activated
from anywhere.

50
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,448
Yeah,
but it can be deactivated

51
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,094
from the ventilation control.

52
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,270
Percy would have
thought of that.

53
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,005
Get me an E.O.D. unit down here,
right away.

54
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,789
I need to get
through this door.

55
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:19,148
There has to be
a way to stop this.

56
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,682
There is.

57
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:22,652
Kill the Guardian,
grab the trigger.

58
00:02:22,777 --> 00:02:24,537
Whoa, what are
we talking about here,

59
00:02:24,662 --> 00:02:25,979
saving Division?

60
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:27,939
It's saving lives.

61
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:29,483
Yeah, lives that
are trying to kill us.

62
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,527
You want to save them so they
can keep trying to kill us?

63
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,196
It's not about saving
Division, Birkhoff.

64
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:37,491
It's about ending this.
Our way, not Percy's.

65
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:41,554
We're gonna need directions
to Oversight.

66
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:42,746
I'll tell you
on the way there.

67
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,291
[Scoffs]
You tried to kill us,

68
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,792
what makes you think
you're along for the ride?

69
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,344
I was just trying
to protect my family.

70
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:49,544
Still am.

71
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,922
Sean, we're going
out there to save her.

72
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,049
Well then you'll need a lot
more than just her location.

73
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,884
You'll need
a tactical breakdown

74
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,427
of the perimeter
and the interior.

75
00:02:57,935 --> 00:02:59,095
You need me there.

76
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,267
You're holding four prominent
Americans at gunpoint,

77
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:06,853
right now, no one knows.

78
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,230
The second
you touch the trigger,

79
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,283
you create national news,

80
00:03:10,408 --> 00:03:12,568
and a nationwide manhunt.

81
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,860
Think about it.

82
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:16,622
Oh, I appreciate
your concern,

83
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:20,326
but Percy's got a plan.

84
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,512
Was it Percy's plan
to end up in a cell?

85
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,963
No.

86
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:24,955
He was betrayed.

87
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,582
Like hell.

88
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:30,335
Percy's the traitor.
He sold out his country,

89
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,304
and one day,
he's going to sell you out,

90
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:32,754
only you're too stupid
to see it.

91
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,633
Ah, oh.

92
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,999
Anyone else got a salient
point they'd like to share?

93
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:46,202
It'll take Phelps' team two
hours to dismantle that bomb.

94
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:47,978
You haven't got that long.

95
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,646
I won't give you Division.

96
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:53,109
You say that as though
you had a choice.

97
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:54,994
I'll let you go.

98
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:58,998
In exchange
for the Clean Sweep trigger.

99
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:00,833
Go where?

100
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:04,387
That would be your choice.

101
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:05,955
But if you try
to return to Division,

102
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,861
I'll have you shot on sight.

103
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:13,012
Hm.

104
00:04:13,137 --> 00:04:15,231
You taught me
a good negotiation

105
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:18,217
is one in which both parties
leave slightly disappointed.

106
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,019
You get to live,
which is disappointing to me,

107
00:04:20,144 --> 00:04:25,074
I remain in control of Division,
which is disappointing to you.

108
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,526
Queen of the understatement.

109
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:27,994
State it any way you like.

110
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:32,355
These are my terms.

111
00:04:32,521 --> 00:04:36,026
Just the navigator.

112
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:39,539
No weapon, and you listen
to everything we say.

113
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:40,697
You got a t-shirt
I can borrow?

114
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:41,948
No.

115
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:43,376
Birkhoff, please,

116
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:46,870
think of a way to remotely
deactivate the trigger.

117
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,065
I told you, I would have seen
this system if it existed,

118
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,633
okay, it's not enough just
to pump gas in there,

119
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:51,833
you have to close off
the outside vents,

120
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:53,752
shut down the elevators,

121
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,438
all that takes power.

122
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:59,892
And I personally retailored
the electrical grid when I...

123
00:05:00,017 --> 00:05:01,144
Was there.

124
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:03,196
What?

125
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:04,781
The old generator.

126
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:06,056
The emergency backup?

127
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,808
No, no, no, the generator that
used to power the missile base.

128
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:11,037
Can you hack it?

129
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:12,455
The only way
to shut that thing down

130
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,147
is to cut the hard-line,
up close and personal.

131
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:17,860
Well, we can't get in there.

132
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,921
I can.

133
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:27,202
Alex, that place is a gas
chamber waiting to happen.

134
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,222
If I hadn't
sent that bank transfer,

135
00:05:29,347 --> 00:05:30,957
the Guardians wouldn't
be where they are right now.

136
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:33,559
I need to do this.

137
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:37,570
And I'm the only one who can.

138
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:44,594
Okay.

139
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,887
Alex heads to Division.

140
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,599
We head to Oversight.

141
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,833
Can I speak with you
for a second?

142
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:57,783
So that's two Guardians,

143
00:05:57,908 --> 00:06:01,319
Amanda, and one rogue Navy Seal.

144
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:03,697
That's a lot of variables
for one mission.

145
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,408
At least we know what
the variables are,

146
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,468
right?

147
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,498
Contact the safe house
in Brighton Beach,

148
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,367
put them on standby.

149
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:16,209
[Door opens]

150
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:17,752
Thank you
for coming down, sir.

151
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:20,056
What is it?
I'm busy.

152
00:06:20,337 --> 00:06:21,724
We've had some success

153
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,175
tracking the Guardian
we lost in Basel.

154
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:26,195
Spyder picked up
on his image in Amsterdam,

155
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:28,648
where he met with another man,

156
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:31,141
whom we also believe to be
one of Percy's Guardians.

157
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,152
Do you believe they have
the Black Boxes with them?

158
00:06:33,277 --> 00:06:34,737
I assume so.

159
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,572
The two men traveled
to Brussels via rail,

160
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:39,566
where they chartered a private jet
to Newark International.

161
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,328
I've yet to pinpoint
their current location,

162
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:44,413
but I would like to retask
the team assigned to hunting

163
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,364
for Alexandra
and put them on the trail.

164
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,368
So, now, Black Boxes are more
important than Alexandra?

165
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:53,339
They both hold secrets
about you, sir,

166
00:06:53,464 --> 00:06:55,248
secrets we want to destroy.

167
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:59,436
Just make sure that your team
hits their mark this time.

168
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,467
Your master and I have reached
a new agreement.

169
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,577
There'll be no new agreement.

170
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:10,907
Talk to him yourself.

171
00:07:11,032 --> 00:07:12,742
Hold your position.

172
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:16,753
I'm coming to you.

173
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,268
{pub}Those were
the perimeter guards.

174
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,225
Well, it's definitely
the right place.

175
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,844
Used to be a safe house
during the Revolutionary War.

176
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:24,698
8,000 square feet,
3 stories including the cellar,

177
00:08:24,823 --> 00:08:26,381
and at least one point
of egress on every side.

178
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,586
Is our line still open?

179
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:31,322
Keep moving.

180
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:32,929
Sounds like they're
moving the hostages.

181
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:36,126
Everyone take a seat.

182
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:37,328
Make yourself comfortable.

183
00:08:37,453 --> 00:08:40,812
Or not.

184
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,028
Why are you moving us
into the study?

185
00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:53,825
Sit down.

186
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:01,568
I'm going in.

187
00:09:01,693 --> 00:09:03,020
No, wait, whoa, whoa.

188
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:04,238
There are two chemically
enhanced killers in there

189
00:09:04,363 --> 00:09:05,406
who can hear a pin drop.

190
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:07,505
If we go in hot,
they will hear,

191
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:09,757
and that means everyone in that
house and Division will die.

192
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:11,695
Sean, we have to be careful.

193
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,996
Clear the perimeter,

194
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:14,448
set up two
long-distance shots.

195
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:18,168
They're the only ones
we're going to get.

196
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:19,475
It will be faster
if we split up.

197
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:20,810
No.

198
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:24,382
We do the sweep together.

199
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:29,263
You know, this would be a

200
00:09:29,388 --> 00:09:30,737
lot easier if you
just trusted me.

201
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,249
It's not about trust,

202
00:09:32,374 --> 00:09:33,801
it's about making sure
you've got this down.

203
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:36,451
Okay, this ain't like
plugging in a toaster.

204
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,372
Now one more time, once you
get down into the silo,

205
00:09:38,497 --> 00:09:39,579
what are you gonna do?

206
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,675
I hit up
the generator access panel,

207
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,625
I plug your phone in, and
your program drains the power.

208
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,834
Right. Now keep in mind,
this thing has

209
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,213
a three-phase transformer
with a four-wire output, okay?

210
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,048
The gray wires...

211
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,102
Are you listening to me?

212
00:09:52,227 --> 00:09:55,639
Yeah, it's all
on your magic phone, right?

213
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:58,164
Just trying to give
you some context.

214
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:02,936
Here.

215
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,617
This should get you around
the internal scramblers.

216
00:10:06,742 --> 00:10:07,985
You know, if I'd
had this last year,

217
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,734
I wouldn't have had
to use that shell program.

218
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,196
Have fun
storming the castle.

219
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:17,211
By the way, what the hell
are you going to tell Amanda?

220
00:10:17,336 --> 00:10:20,037
Exactly what
she wants to hear.

221
00:10:29,298 --> 00:10:31,965
I will confirm our arrival
once we reach the rendez-vous.

222
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:36,386
Actually, Lawrence will.

223
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,849
I want you on base,
monitoring the perimeter,

224
00:10:38,974 --> 00:10:42,225
in case there are any more
surprises waiting for us.

225
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,570
I'll be tracking
the escort team,

226
00:10:43,695 --> 00:10:45,022
but I want verbal
updates every 15 minutes

227
00:10:45,147 --> 00:10:49,691
confirming your status.

228
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:54,615
He may try to talk to you,
or convince you, manipulate you.

229
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,867
As long as you know that
everything out of his mouth

230
00:10:56,992 --> 00:10:59,953
is a lie.

231
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:02,412
I will miss you.

232
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:44,381
[Phone dialing, ringing]

233
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:46,383
Percy's on the move.

234
00:11:46,508 --> 00:11:48,952
I had to meet him halfway.

235
00:11:49,077 --> 00:11:52,456
I'm more concerned about
the problem inside Division.

236
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:54,958
We have a saboteur.

237
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:59,677
Something's moving.

238
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:03,975
We gotta stop him.
They're going to hear.

239
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:16,037
[Gurgling, choking]

240
00:12:17,272 --> 00:12:20,625
[Vase banging]

241
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,698
[Door opening]

242
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,626
Why didn't you shoot him?

243
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:05,212
I wanted to,

244
00:13:05,337 --> 00:13:06,411
make it look like
the guard did it, but...

245
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,965
It's a different
caliber gun.

246
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,833
The Guardian inside would have
heard and shot everyone else.

247
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,175
No way.

248
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,329
You think I wanted
to let him die?

249
00:13:16,348 --> 00:13:18,265
You don't know me.

250
00:13:26,174 --> 00:13:29,019
Lawrence, at this pace we have
you arriving at the Gates house

251
00:13:29,144 --> 00:13:30,521
in approximately 30 minutes.

252
00:13:30,646 --> 00:13:32,061
Does that match your estimate?

253
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:36,200
Affirmative.

254
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:42,655
I want a progress report
from Phelps.

255
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,401
We're looking at
four detonator cords,

256
00:13:44,526 --> 00:13:45,950
all rigged to
an electrical housing unit.

257
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,404
I'm guessing we'll need
to open this thing up first

258
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,840
before we can
disable the fuses.

259
00:13:49,965 --> 00:13:54,250
No guesses, just results.

260
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,130
I'm picking up a bogey on our
thermal image scanners,

261
00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:58,921
approaching the northern
external perimeter.

262
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:01,485
I have Alexandra Udinov
at the northeast gate.

263
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,023
She's requesting entry.

264
00:14:06,148 --> 00:14:07,431
Bring her in.

265
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:11,767
Eric Lawrence.

266
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:15,980
You were looking at
25 years in Sing Sing

267
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:20,203
for smashing a man's head
against a telephone pole

268
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:24,107
until his neck snapped.

269
00:14:24,232 --> 00:14:26,282
Granted, he did
rape your sister.

270
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,111
But there was no
material evidence

271
00:14:28,236 --> 00:14:30,998
that would have led
to an appeal.

272
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:32,883
And then I stepped in.

273
00:14:33,008 --> 00:14:35,886
Got you out,
gave you back your life.

274
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:37,543
Taught you how
to fight for freedom.

275
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:40,505
Now look at you.

276
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,006
Benjamin Greenwood.

277
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:47,014
Got you out of an institution
for the criminally insane.

278
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:49,983
Adrian Paticki.

279
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:51,766
Wrongfully sentenced,

280
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,310
but on death row.

281
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,773
I saved all your lives,

282
00:14:56,898 --> 00:15:00,410
which is why it pains me
that you would demonstrate

283
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:02,693
more loyalty to Amanda

284
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:04,831
than you would to me.

285
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,921
I was beginning to wonder if
I'd ever hear from you again.

286
00:15:11,046 --> 00:15:13,120
I know.
I have a lot to explain.

287
00:15:13,286 --> 00:15:16,376
I know you went
into Russia, Alex.

288
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:18,261
I warned you
about attacking Semak

289
00:15:18,386 --> 00:15:21,045
without my help,
before you were ready.

290
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,922
I know.

291
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,465
You're lucky you survived.

292
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:25,469
I know.

293
00:15:25,594 --> 00:15:26,467
How did you make it out?

294
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:28,052
It couldn't have been easy.

295
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,272
I got in on my own,

296
00:15:29,397 --> 00:15:30,721
and I got out the same way.

297
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:32,192
Hm.

298
00:15:32,317 --> 00:15:33,808
But you were
right about Semak.

299
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,478
It was too much for me
to handle on my own.

300
00:15:37,644 --> 00:15:41,899
Especially because of what
I found there.

301
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:44,610
Please, tell me
you didn't know.

302
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:45,956
Know what?

303
00:15:46,081 --> 00:15:49,192
My mother, Katya.

304
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:52,629
She's alive.

305
00:15:52,754 --> 00:15:54,078
I don't understand.

306
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:57,501
Semak must have made
a deal with Percy.

307
00:15:57,626 --> 00:15:59,417
He's the only reason I'm back.

308
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,919
I don't care if I have to
torture it out of him,

309
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:06,660
I want to know why
he lied to me.

310
00:16:06,785 --> 00:16:11,355
I'm afraid that's going
to be difficult right now.

311
00:16:16,978 --> 00:16:19,990
I just wish I had more time
to convince you

312
00:16:20,115 --> 00:16:21,314
that what you're doing
is wrong.

313
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,982
It just doesn't seem fair.

314
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,447
Oh, well.

315
00:16:28,907 --> 00:16:30,033
[Bang]

316
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:32,783

tires screeching]

[Computer beeps,
flatlines]

318
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,510
There's something wrong.

319
00:17:19,445 --> 00:17:20,637
{pub}How close are we?

320
00:17:20,762 --> 00:17:21,855
We've interrupted
the electrical current

321
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,307
of the detonator hub,

322
00:17:24,432 --> 00:17:25,642
but we still need
to make sure there aren't any

323
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:28,798
tilt vibration switches
before we move anything.

324
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,097
Time is not a luxury you have,
take too long

325
00:17:30,222 --> 00:17:31,842
and you might
not live to see tomorrow.

326
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:35,137
How the hell did Percy get
a weapon?

327
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:38,182
Percy has a silent partner
inside Division.

328
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:40,309
Right now,
Roan is my prime suspect.

329
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,186
That would be a good guess.

330
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,661
I've been following
his movements.

331
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:46,797
But I'm concerned

332
00:17:46,922 --> 00:17:50,277
he may be collaborating
with others.

333
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:54,672
In fact, the only person I know
he's not working with is you.

334
00:17:54,797 --> 00:17:55,866
You've been away.

335
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:58,452
Do me a favor.

336
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:01,330
Keep an eye on him,
report back to me.

337
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:02,896
Once I know who
he's working with,

338
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:07,992
I intend to drown him in
a pool of his own acid.

339
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:44,321
Hey, it's me,
we have a problem.

340
00:18:44,446 --> 00:18:46,356
With the generator?

341
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:47,775
With Percy.

342
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,928
He was on his way to you, and he took out
the Alpha team that was escorting him.

343
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:52,006
Where is he now?

344
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,507
He disabled
the vehicle tracker.

345
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:54,581
What are you gonna do?

346
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:56,218
You just focus
on your objective.

347
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:58,068
Now that Amanda's lost
her leverage over Percy,

348
00:18:58,193 --> 00:19:00,838
nothing's going to stop him
from hitting that trigger.

349
00:19:00,963 --> 00:19:03,631
Alex, you are our best shot
at stopping Clean Sweep.

350
00:19:11,056 --> 00:19:12,818
Enjoying the countryside?

351
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:14,751
Eh, the ragweed,

352
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:16,030
doesn't agree with me.

353
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,588
Take an allergy pill.

354
00:19:18,713 --> 00:19:20,534
Roan's gun came in handy.

355
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,913
What about the hostages?

356
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,415
Tell them to sit tight.

357
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:30,336
I can't wait to see them.

358
00:19:30,776 --> 00:19:34,548
I've spent my life
in the military.

359
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:39,011
I understand what it is to be
beholden to your C.O.

360
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:41,096
that sense of duty,

361
00:19:41,262 --> 00:19:42,598
obeying the orders,

362
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,559
following them into
the jaws of death.

363
00:19:45,725 --> 00:19:47,885
But you don't have
to get caught up in this war,

364
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,146
you have options.

365
00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:51,065
If you had a little money
in your pocket,

366
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,691
more than a little,

367
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:55,611
you wouldn't have
to answer to Percy

368
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:59,949
anymore.

369
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,631
According to
local news reports,

370
00:20:01,756 --> 00:20:03,300
a small
recreational plane

371
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:05,871
crashed just outside
of Saratoga National Park.

372
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:08,105
The pilot, one Darren Smalls,

373
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,834
had just signed
up two passengers

374
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,325
for skydiving,

375
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,443
but only his body
was recovered from the wreckage.

376
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:15,464
The names of the passengers

377
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,843
match the names on the fake
passports used by the Guardians.

378
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,303
You believe they jumped
out of this plane?

379
00:20:21,469 --> 00:20:22,847
Where could they be headed?

380
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,339
The only structure of note

381
00:20:25,464 --> 00:20:29,186
within a 20 kilometer radius
of the crash,

382
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:30,855
is an old historical landmark,

383
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,357
the Gates house.

384
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,515
Satellite imagery
of the location

385
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,682
reveals several
vehicles outside.

386
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:37,194
I think they're
there right now.

387
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,445
Is the team on their way?

388
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:41,795
En route as we speak.

389
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,713
You sure we shouldn't
be wearing bomb suits?

390
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,488
This thing goes off
in this corridor,

391
00:20:58,613 --> 00:21:02,469
concussion alone would
turn us into jelly.

392
00:21:02,635 --> 00:21:06,037
Plus, the suit makes
my hands sweat.

393
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,366
One down, three to go.

394
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:26,183
I'm going to head up,

395
00:21:26,308 --> 00:21:31,228

soldering wire.

396

[Neck snaps]

397
00:22:07,221 --> 00:22:08,118
Hi, Percy.

398
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,586
{pub}You, here.

399
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,184
What are the odds?

400
00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:34,369
Tell your Guardians to
give up the Clean Sweep trigger,

401
00:22:34,494 --> 00:22:35,729
and Oversight,

402
00:22:35,946 --> 00:22:38,290
and you may get
out of here alive.

403
00:22:38,415 --> 00:22:39,400
Michael,

404
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,527
I see you're embracing the whole
"rebel without a cause" motif,

405
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,405
right down to the hairstyle.

406
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:48,250
Can I shoot him now?

407
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,576
Not yet.

408
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:52,204
I crashed your little
"Guardian party" in Amsterdam.

409
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,556
The Boxes are gone,

410
00:22:54,681 --> 00:22:56,125
along with your
insurance policy.

411
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,626
How do you think
we got here?

412
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,544
We followed your boys.

413
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,264
Even if that were the case,

414
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:04,925
the Guardians have been given
strict instructions

415
00:23:05,142 --> 00:23:08,020
to pull the trigger
and gas Division

416
00:23:08,145 --> 00:23:10,896
if anything happens to me.

417
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,028
I'm in,
I'm headed to the silo.

418
00:23:16,153 --> 00:23:17,271
Five by five.

419
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:18,730
Did Amanda give you
any trouble?

420
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:19,982
No, she's all freaked
out about Percy and Roan.

421
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,192
She asked me
to go spy on him.

422
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:23,360
But you're
blowing her off, right?

423
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:27,156
Yup.

424
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,866
What are you doing down here?

425
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:33,211
Oh, no, that's not good.

426
00:23:33,336 --> 00:23:37,266
I was actually looking
for you.

427
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,634
I know you were there

428
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:40,502
the night Division raided
my family's home.

429
00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:43,047
You said "mother down",
confirming your kill.

430
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:48,193
But she wasn't dead,
was she?

431
00:23:48,318 --> 00:23:49,928
You used a tranquilizer,

432
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,599
a little special side mission
for Percy.

433
00:23:53,824 --> 00:23:57,486
I want to know the truth about
what happened on that night.

434
00:23:57,611 --> 00:24:00,656
That's not why you're here.

435
00:24:00,781 --> 00:24:02,274
Well then,
why the hell are you here?

436
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,359
Oh, just sabotaging Division.

437
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:08,739
Special little side mission
for Percy.

438
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,711
Phelps, is that you?

439
00:24:22,877 --> 00:24:24,797
[Bang]

440
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:35,766
I feel like I've landed
in an alternate universe.

441
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,859
You, fighting
to save Division.

442
00:24:37,984 --> 00:24:40,445
I don't expect you
to understand me, Percy.

443
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,397
I understood your quest
for vengeance,

444
00:24:42,563 --> 00:24:44,858
retribution for your fiance.

445
00:24:45,492 --> 00:24:49,071
Do you two talk much
about Daniel?

446
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:52,157
Must be a little awkward, since
you knew about the kill order

447
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:57,045
and didn't warn her.

448
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,513
If you think anyone's going
to believe your lies,

449
00:24:58,638 --> 00:25:00,849
you're wrong.

450
00:25:00,974 --> 00:25:02,626
Owen told me
the truth about Daniel.

451
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:03,852
But does Michael
know the truth

452
00:25:03,977 --> 00:25:07,005
about you and Owen?

453
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,423
See, that's the look
that tells me

454
00:25:08,589 --> 00:25:11,610
everything I need to know.

455
00:25:11,735 --> 00:25:12,970
The crack in the foundation.

456
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,055
I don't blame you.

457
00:25:15,272 --> 00:25:16,807
She lured you in with
the promise of regaining

458
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,725
everything that you'd lost.

459
00:25:18,942 --> 00:25:20,435
Next thing you know,
you're knee-deep

460
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:22,396
in Nikita's war
with no end in sight.

461
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,822
That's funny.

462
00:25:23,947 --> 00:25:25,315
I see an end in sight,
right here.

463
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:27,067
Such a commanding presence.

464
00:25:27,233 --> 00:25:30,320
It's like she's leading
the new crusades.

465
00:25:30,486 --> 00:25:33,282
So many people willing to lay
down their lives for you.

466
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,468

over there.

00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:43,625
That's a hell of a get.

469
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:46,712
I can still see your pimply face
on the family Christmas cards.

470
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,881
Looks like the Navy made
a real man out of you.

471
00:25:49,105 --> 00:25:51,650
You're here
for Senator Madeline.

472

If I don't answer it,

476
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,017
Patrick will wonder what's
happened to me.

477
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:04,570
And if he thinks
anything's gone wrong...

478
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:10,319

479
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,004

and release the hostages,

he's not dead already?

they had it coming.

out of the way,

I'll give you Senator Pierce,

with the trigger.

got you.

00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,475
Okay, great,
you've got one more left.

537
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,936
It's the black one connected
to the transformer.

538
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,021
That'll cancel the override.

539
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:41,393
Got it.

540
00:31:43,796 --> 00:31:46,196
Good, now get the hell
out of there.

541
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:58,636
[Breathing heavily]

542
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:22,148
[Sighs, pants]

543
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,173
Where's Sean?

544
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:48,340
He's outside.

545
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,801
And you're welcome.

546
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,804
[Whispers]
Behind you.

547
00:33:18,829 --> 00:33:21,870
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

548
00:33:21,995 --> 00:33:23,126
Yeah, I'm fine.

549
00:33:30,837 --> 00:33:31,926
Thank you.

550
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,065
{pub}This is Admiral Winnick
of Southern Command.

551
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,858
Yes, he was.

552
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:50,111
This is Amanda.

553
00:33:50,277 --> 00:33:51,529
Confirm Division survived.

554
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:56,084
Senator, are you all right?

555
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:57,160
Yes.

556
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,579
Percy and his men left.

557
00:33:59,745 --> 00:34:00,856
And Clean Sweep,
has it been...

558
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:02,040
Averted.

559
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,726
Percy must have lost
control of the trigger,

560
00:34:03,851 --> 00:34:05,126
or perhaps it was destroyed.

561
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:06,419
Whatever the case,

562
00:34:06,737 --> 00:34:09,005
I've made sure Clean Sweep will
never threaten Division again.

563
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:12,484
Shall I send escorts
for you and the others?

564
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:15,471
It's just me.

565
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:18,991
That's... unfortunate.

566
00:34:19,116 --> 00:34:21,226
We'll get to work on
a cover story right away,

567
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,012
to explain their deaths.

568
00:34:23,137 --> 00:34:24,604
Most likely the act
of a deranged

569
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,815
domestic terrorist.

570
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,983
Yes. Make sure it looks
as though they died heroes.

571
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:30,610
And once things settle down,

572
00:34:30,776 --> 00:34:33,863
we need to discuss how
to proceed with Division.

573
00:34:34,029 --> 00:34:36,616
Needless to say,
after recent events,

574
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:37,742
a low profile is in order.

575
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:39,661
Absolutely.

576
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:43,232
We'll discuss it next week
in Washington.

577
00:34:43,357 --> 00:34:46,402
It's probably best to keep
communications to a minimum.

578
00:34:46,527 --> 00:34:48,920
As you say, we should
all keep our heads down.

579
00:34:49,086 --> 00:34:50,522
Amanda.

580
00:34:50,647 --> 00:34:52,132
After all,
we wouldn't want to risk

581
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,968
setting off any flags with
your colleagues in D.C.

582
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:56,144
But I promise,

583
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:58,638
Division will stay
strong and alert.

584
00:34:58,804 --> 00:35:01,491
Good-bye.

585
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,854
What's wrong?

586
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,355
It's Amanda.

587
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:09,749
I've lost control of her.

588
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:59,040
Division's still standing.

589
00:35:59,165 --> 00:36:03,044
Clean Sweep failed.

590
00:36:03,169 --> 00:36:05,230
That's good.

591
00:36:05,355 --> 00:36:08,708
Leaves us some options.

592
00:36:08,874 --> 00:36:12,061
Let's get moving.

593
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:36,295
How did you...

594
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,779
Roan.

595
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,156
Ah. I take it you lost him.

596
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:41,908
I survived him.

597
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,785
You were right.

598
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,286
He was Percy's inside man.

599
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:47,022
And now he's gone.

600
00:36:47,147 --> 00:36:48,540
As is Percy.

601
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,209
What about you, Alex?

602
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,352
Where will you go now?

603
00:36:58,158 --> 00:36:59,342
I don't know.

604
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,386
Semak is still out there.

605
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,772
So is my mother.

606
00:37:03,897 --> 00:37:05,707
And she's with him.

607
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:06,792
[Sighs]

608
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:07,960
Alex, believe it or not,

609
00:37:08,085 --> 00:37:09,727
I still want to help you.

610
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:13,314
Why?

611
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,193
So you can get
a foothold in Zetrov?

612
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,804
Not interested.

613
00:37:18,929 --> 00:37:21,781
You should be.

614
00:37:21,947 --> 00:37:23,959
You threaten the hold
Semak has on his empire.

615
00:37:24,084 --> 00:37:26,161
That's why he fears you.

616
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:29,898
Alexandra Udinov's existence

617
00:37:30,023 --> 00:37:33,402
has the potential
to shatter his world.

618
00:37:33,527 --> 00:37:34,820
Too bad the world thinks

619
00:37:34,945 --> 00:37:36,921
Alexandra Udinov is dead.

620
00:37:39,085 --> 00:37:41,400
But what if they were
to learn the truth?

621
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:00,779
If Division's
truly gone rogue,

622
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,598
you have no choice.

623
00:38:02,723 --> 00:38:04,282
You have to contact the CIA.

624
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,267
Yeah, what are
they going to do?

625
00:38:05,392 --> 00:38:06,743
Send in the Marines?

626
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,187
Division's an army.

627
00:38:08,312 --> 00:38:09,412
You're going to have
a war on your hands.

628
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,390
She's right.

629
00:38:11,515 --> 00:38:13,249
Enough people have died.

630
00:38:13,415 --> 00:38:15,209
It's funny.

631
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:18,087
You seem to be so concerned
about the body count now.

632
00:38:18,253 --> 00:38:20,173
Didn't bother you when you were
sanctioning all those hits.

633
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,017
They were necessary.

634
00:38:22,142 --> 00:38:23,343
Oh, I'm sure
it seemed necessary

635
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,987
in this room.

636
00:38:25,112 --> 00:38:26,554
But I was the one
who had to pull the trigger.

637
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,764
You were a soldier.

638
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,993
I was a killer.

639
00:38:31,118 --> 00:38:32,461
You're right.

640
00:38:32,586 --> 00:38:33,811
I don't know what it's like.

641
00:38:33,977 --> 00:38:38,024
You had to live in Division,
I didn't.

642
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,636
Which is why you're the only one
who can take it down

643
00:38:40,761 --> 00:38:44,030
without exposing it
to the public.

644
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,449
I hate to say it,
but she has a point.

645
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,428
Exposing Division
is just as bad

646
00:38:49,553 --> 00:38:50,787
as releasing the Black Boxes.

647
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:51,847
This is the person

648
00:38:51,972 --> 00:38:53,765
who put a target on our backs.

649
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,291
What if I could fix that?

650
00:38:55,457 --> 00:38:58,252
Clear your names.

651
00:38:58,418 --> 00:39:00,254
A presidential pardon.

652
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,842
No.

653
00:39:05,068 --> 00:39:07,246
If you reveal your part
in this to the President,

654
00:39:07,371 --> 00:39:08,554
you'll go to prison.

655
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,817
No.

656
00:39:11,942 --> 00:39:14,102
I would receive immunity

657
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:19,041
for my silence.

658
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:21,217
What do you say?

659
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:27,490
I thought today was going
to be the day it all ended.

660
00:39:27,707 --> 00:39:29,184
It might not have worked
out that way,

661
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:30,994
but this is the first time

662
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,915
I can see a real light
at the end of the tunnel,

663
00:39:36,081 --> 00:39:37,967
for all of us.

664
00:40:06,263 --> 00:40:11,960
[Phone dials, rings]

665
00:40:12,085 --> 00:40:13,244
We're almost there.

666
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,846
Of course,
Percy's still a problem,

667
00:40:14,971 --> 00:40:16,131
when is he not?

668
00:40:16,256 --> 00:40:17,373
He's down to Roan

669
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,792
and one Guardian,
thanks to your hit squad.

670
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:22,128
Then I guess their timing
was perfect.

671
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,838
How can I repay you?

672
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,443
Oh,

673
00:40:26,017 --> 00:40:27,800
I can think of a few ways.

674
00:40:30,237 --> 00:40:31,345
Time for that later,

675
00:40:31,511 --> 00:40:33,931
we still have business
to discuss.

676
00:40:34,097 --> 00:40:36,225
My superiors are no longer
an issue.

677
00:40:36,391 --> 00:40:37,986
[Sighs]

678
00:40:38,111 --> 00:40:40,605
Yes, we still have my boss
to contend with.

679
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,374
Well the good news
on that front is that

680
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:44,942
I think Alexandra may
be ready to make her return.

681
00:40:45,108 --> 00:40:48,613
And Nikita?

682
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:53,385
I have a future planned
for her too.

683
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,583
It's considerably shorter.

684
