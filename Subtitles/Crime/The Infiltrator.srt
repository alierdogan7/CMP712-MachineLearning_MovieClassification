- She's with him? She's with him.
- She's with him, yeah.

509
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,402
How about that, huh?
Hey, I don't know if you know this,

510
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,609
- but Bob owns all of Oceanbird Airlines.
- Boss. You need to sign these.

511
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,565
Thank you.

512
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,603
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Dominic. He's my cousin
and also an executive with Oceanbird.

513
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,808
No, tell them the truth. I'm your asshole.

514
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,127
Any time Bob's ass is in a hole,
mine better hop straight to it.

515
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,129
I'd do anything for my cousin. All right?

516
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,206
All right, who's ready to go to Jersey, right?
(RUBBING HANDS TOGETHER)

517
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,441
Let's go to Bob's mansion.

00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,447
- Well, welcome to my home.
- OSPINA: Thank you.

00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,326
MAZUR: Because of the family's business,

523
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,848
I have access to foreign banks,
including Panama,

which has strict secrecy laws

525
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,450
Your business will boom
if you work with me.

526
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,047
I'm sorry, Mr. Bob. But what is "boom"?

527
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,246
Boom... Uh...

528
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,041
(IMITATES EXPLOSION) Grow.

529
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,328
You gotta understand that Bob's a gardener,

530
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,730
and he sprinkles a little water on the money,
and all of a sudden it blooms.

531
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,005
What is "bloom"?

532
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,446
ABREU: (CHUCKLES) Bloom, it's...

533
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,161
It's rooms and rooms full of cash, chacho.

534
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,488
Rooms filled with cash.

535
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,245
- ABREU: Sí, something like that. Yeah. Yeah.
- Sounds good, man.

536
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,330
- May God bless you with that problem.
- ABREU: Yeah, amen to that.

537
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:31,689
Well, my people in Colombia
have always been

538
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,525
very, very comfortable
with the Panamanian banks.

539
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,161
Noriega has handled
some of our most sensitive business.

540
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,525
I promise you that I will make it
my business to enhance yours.

541
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,491
And when I do, I need a promise from you
that you will make it your business

542
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,889
to let the right people know my name.

543
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,485
Money makes money.

544
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,121
- Here's to that.

MAZUR: Now, no one can put me in jail
because I make a bad loan.

546
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,167
However, if I'm dishing out cash

547
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,528
to a client like Southern Air Transport,
which has no cover,

548
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,330
and one of their planes goes down
with a load of powder,

549
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,725
I am fucked.

550
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,007
And so are you. And you, and you.

551
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,400
So, I need a face-to-face with the man
who runs Southern Air Transport

552
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,724
- so I can clean up this mess.

I think we should walk before we run.

556

00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,086
Mr. Mora, are you okay?

559
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,205
MAZUR: Dom, can you help us out here?

560
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,606
- MAZUR: Are you okay?
- ABREU: Are you all right.

561
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,330
MAZUR: Help him out here a little bit.

562
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,528
I told him not to drink.
He has sugar in his blood.

563
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,443
- MAZUR: Get him a nice cold washcloth.
- ABREU: Right. Right.

564
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,607
- MAZUR: Help him out.
- ABREU: Are you all right?

565
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,528
- MAZUR: Oh, Mora Sr. all right?
- Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

566
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,726
He'll be down in a minute.

567
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,204
Get your hands off me!

568
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,970
Gonzalo, I cannot live
with Ospina touching me.

569
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,810
- Touching you?
- Yeah. He grabbed me.

- He likes you.

00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,091
- That's...
- Wow. No, listen,

574
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,010
actually Ospina's nickname
is La Mina, you know.

575
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,087
It means two things in Spanish.
Gold mine or land mine.

576
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,486
With him you never know.

577
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,528
But, my friend, a condition of
doing business with us is doing Ospina.

578
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,769
Are you saying that
you want me to fuck Ospina?

579
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,047
- Or have Ospina fuck me?
- Yeah.

580
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,451
- To make a deal? Are you serious?
- Yeah.

581
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,691
- He's our family, you know...
- Fuck that! There's no deal.

582
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,007
- Okay, no deal. Okay, okay. Let's go.
- I'm out. No deal. Sorry.

00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,366
- He'll take you anywhere you wanna go.
- Okay.

Got you, man.

You son of a bitch. (CHUCKLES)

- You son of a bitch.
- He's fucking with you.

- He came on to me...
- Did you know about this?

590
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,042
He came on to me, too. Fucking maricón.

591
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,806
But the cartel loves him.

00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,363
He is the favorite son, Mr. Bob.

593
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,525
So, even if you see him fucking a goat,
which you might,

594
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,490
you must say,
"That's a fucking nice-looking goat, man."

he'll kill your fucking wife,
and your two kids.

and then he's gonna kill me.

I see your accounts are quite active.

- Is that a problem?
- No, no, quite the opposite.

But we do have a problem
with two of your checks.

661

Now, on one,

662
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,247
the payee is blank.

663
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,244

I will manage this personally.

Mr. Bilgrami, as long as I have you
on the phone, I wonder if you can help me.

673
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,050
Is there anyone on your team
who can help me here, in the States?

674

01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,001
He's fucking robbing from us...

1179
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,210
- This is a fuckin' cop.
- I'm telling you.

1180

(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1181
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,364
I'm going to kill you, man.

1182
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:58,484
- I'm gonna kill you, man. Fucking idiot.
- You're going to kill me?

1183
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,803
Okay. Yeah? I don't have anything, man.

1184
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,370
- Come on, turn around...
- This is a fucking cop!

1185
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,124
The money's right there. There you go.

1186
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,123
I don't have anything.

1187
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,247
- Whoa. Whoops.
- Fuck.

1188
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,765
What is that? Green shit?

1189
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:16,165
This is your fucking money!

1190
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,480
Fucking asshole!

1191
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,166
I'm so scared of you
with your dick hanging out like that.

1192
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:23,246
Bang!

I love you, man.

1196
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,731
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me? Then fuck me. Oh, yeah.

1197
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,246
- Fuck you.
- To fucking me.

1198
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,601
You know, I really like you, man.

1199
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:48,048
Because the only thing I care about
is money.

ALCAINO: Dear Father in Heaven,

1214
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,963
we were cursed tonight.

1215
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,321
Colombia fell to Mexico,

1216
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:02,724
but we are also blessed, dear God,
that you have brought into our lives,

1217
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,325
Bob and his Kathy.

1218
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,525
We love them.

1219
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:10,966
Like family.

1220
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,729
I feel good tonight, Bob.

1221
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,723
MAZUR: Well, it is a good night, my friend.

1222
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:27,601
All of my cash,
this economic renaissance, this new Miami.

1223
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,286
The economy is addicted to drugs.

1224
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:33,921
You know who's
the biggest money launderer in the US?

1225
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,843
Well, I thought it was me.

1226
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:37,727
No? (CHUCKLES)

1227
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:39,651
No.

1228
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,326
Your Federal Reserve Bank.

1229
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,528
It's called the anonymous window.

1230
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:47,763
They accept pallet loads of cash
that used to be drug pesos,

1231
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:51,601
hundreds of millions of dollars
from my country's central bank,

1232
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:53,649
no questions asked.

1233
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:57,011
If your government
didn't have my dirty money,

1234
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,090
your economy would collapse.

1235
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:08,569
You know, Bob, I think
I'm going to introduce you to Pablo.

1236
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:14,323
But there's a little problem
I need you to fix first.

1237
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:18,449
MAZUR: Alcaino says
Don Chepe's $10 million is frozen,

1238
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,443
which is actually Pablo Escobar's money.

1239
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:24,570
And he doesn't give a rat's ass
that our government did it.

1240
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,087
He wants his money
and it's not gonna be over until he gets it.

1241
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,401
There's a Senate investigation into Noriega.

1242
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,608
You're not getting money
that went through Panama!

1243
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,126
Frozen is frozen. Accept it.

1244
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,368
Mark, it's fucking up our operation.

1245
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:39,851
We need you to fix this for us.

1246
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,763
How am I gonna fix this?

1247
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:43,524
You want me to call Senator Kerry?

1248
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,523
"Hey, John,
could you drop your investigation

"'Cause, my friend Bob's
getting really upset?"

01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,767
Reagan wants Noriega's ass.
Are you listening to me?

1252
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,484
Hey, hey. You know what Alcaino said?

1253
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,570
"That's not an answer
that keeps you alive, my friend."

1254
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,241
- Okay?
- Hey. What did you say that for?

1255
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:00,890
No. Wait a second, hold on.
Did he threaten you?

1256
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,690
- No.
- Did he put your neck in a noose?

1257
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:03,961
Yeah, and he's squeezing.

1258
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,611
No, he didn't. Roberto didn't say that.
He wouldn't say that.

1259
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:08,045
It's Escobar.

1260
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,566
Wait a second.

1261
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:14,800
Bob, are you in danger from Pablo Escobar
if his money doesn't come through?

1262
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,481
Ev.

1263
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,487

ALCAINO: (ON TAPE) Don Pablo is not happy

1265

10 million of Don Chepe's money,
which is Escobar's money,

1266
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,365

It seems your President Reagan,

01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,806
he's frozen all Panamanian accounts
in an effort...

1270
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:04,442
That is not an answer that keeps you alive.

1271
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:05,601
Daddy?

1272
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,205
You should work this out
before Don Pablo does.

1273
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,521
- Something's dripping.
- If you know what I mean.

1274
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,200
Did you cut yourself?

1275
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:17,845
Come here. Come here.

1276
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,522
Daddy will take care of it.
No, it's all right.

Okay, all right. All right, it's okay.

It's all right. Here we go.

- Okay. It's all right. Shh, shh.

No, it's okay.
Just a misunderstanding, that's all.

You fucking don't.

These people
are not fucking cops, Bobby, all right?

1297
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,282
They will make you die for days
and they've got fucking good at it.

1298
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,408
You know what? They cut off your fingers.
They cut off your toes.

1299
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,050
They inject you
with that fucking adrenalin shit

1300
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:56,202
so you don't pass out before any of that.

1301

Man, they cut open your fucking eyes
so you can't shut them,

1302
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,643
and then they're gonna
bring in your little fucking family.

1303
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,762
They'll cut your son's head off
with a cheese wire.

They'll do the same to your little girl.

1305
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:08,688
And then, they'll cut your wife's tits off
right in front of you

1306
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:09,841
and they won't feel a fucking thing.

1307
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:13,163
Last but not least,
they're gonna cut your fucking head off

1308
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:14,924
and send it
to your buddies down at Customs.

1309
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:49,290
You could have retired, couldn't you?

1310
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,010
You made a choice.

Roberto.

01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:33,447
They are Japanese Akoya pearls,
prized for their elegance.

You don't find these in lagoons,
you have to dive deep to get them.

How do they look?

Like they've been stuck inside a shell
waiting to be around your neck.

1322
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:02,563
Roberto, thank you so much.

- Of course.

I gotta go look at it. Oh, my God. (CHUCKLES)

01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,681
Well, you certainly know
how to make women happy.

Thank you.

I don't wanna talk about business
on such a beautiful day,

1328
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,489
but I must have that money.

1329
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,600
Escobar sent me his calling card.

1330
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,291
- A bloody coffin.

I apologize for my associate's indiscretion,

1332

but as your friend,
I beg you to get him his money.

1333
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,001
Without it, he is an animal.

1334
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:48,165
And I'm asking you to tell Don Chepe
to deliver a message to Escobar

1335
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,811
that I do not do business under threat.

1336
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,803
Well, at this point, unfortunately,

1337
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:56,965
neither you nor I are in a position
to dictate terms to Don Pablo.

1338

Thank you very much
for having me to your home.

01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:10,171
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

Well, it's a weekend,
I'll just get right to the point.

If you consider me
to be important to the bank,

1343

01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,843
You will fucking regret this!

1683
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:16,161
You hear me!

1684
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:18,329
You'll live to regret this!

1685
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:26,120
(YELLING IN SPANISH)

1686
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:28,881
Take them away.

1687
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:32,171
GLORIA: You will regret this.

1688
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:35,768
- Go on. Please, take 'em out.
- All right, get them out of here!

1689
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:38,366
Clear it out! Clear it out!
Get all the cuffed people out of here!

1690
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:42,526
VON RAAB: Well,
the drug dealers have said that,

1691
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:45,729
your children are
the business of their future.

1692
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,449
America needs to stop this scourge.

1693
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:50,727
And these arrests
are a big step in that direction.

1694
01:55:51,200 --> 01:55:53,931
A beginning to an end of those who seek...

1695
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,128
- Bob.
- Hey.

1696
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:58,123
Armbrecht was taken down at the airport.

1697
01:55:58,200 --> 01:55:59,361
Al right. Thank you.

1698
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:01,525
- Good job.
- You, too.

1699
01:56:04,160 --> 01:56:05,764
Ain't that some shit, Bob?

1700
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:09,162
Tischler bails when the shit goes down, and
then she shows up to take the credit, huh?

1701
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:11,720
- Are you surprised?
- A little.

1702
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:14,726
You know, you were right.

1703
01:56:15,880 --> 01:56:17,166
Of course, I'm always right.

1704
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:18,721
The informant.

1705
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:21,921
Okay, all right, I'm 99% right.

1706
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:27,250
I loved Bob Musella.

1707
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:31,247
Me, too. Me, too.

1708
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,001
Hey, Bob.

1709
01:56:35,720 --> 01:56:37,768
Not all your friends
went to jail today, all right?

1710
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,286
- Hey.
- MAZUR: Hey.

1711
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:55,765
So, Customs is letting me keep the dress,
but not the pearls.

1712
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:58,887
Too bad you got jilted, you look so hot.

1713
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:01,410
- (ALL CHUCKLING)
- (PHONE RINGING)

1714
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:05,805
Did you get him to talk?
I'm sorry. I'll catch you guys later.

1715
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:09,646
You wanna help me?

1716
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:12,761
Yeah.

1717
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:38,044
Well, it's still a pretty good ending.

1718
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:41,281
It was, wasn't it?

1719
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:02,166
Go home, Bob.

1720
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:16,846
EVELYN: You okay there?

1721
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:34,491
Harley, you're up next.

1722
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:36,805
Here, catch.

1723
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:46,364
- EVELYN: Hey.
- MAZUR: Hi.
