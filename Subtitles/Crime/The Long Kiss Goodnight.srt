Hey, gorgeous.

1403
01:51:30,976 --> 01:51:33,561
You got your mommy's eyes.

1404
01:51:34,772 --> 01:51:37,565
Don't let nobody tell you different.

1405
01:51:42,279 --> 01:51:44,947
Hey, hang in there, partner.

1406
01:51:45,115 --> 01:51:47,492
Did you forget we're rich?

1407
01:51:56,543 --> 01:51:57,585
CAINE:
Hello?

1408
01:51:57,753 --> 01:52:00,213
WOMAN: I'm putting your call
through to the president.

1409
01:52:00,381 --> 01:52:02,382
PRESIDENT: Hello, Miss Caine.
-Yes, Mr. President.

1410
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:04,133
I owe you.

1411
01:52:04,301 --> 01:52:07,678
The country owes you
a debt of tremendous gratitude.

1412
01:52:08,389 --> 01:52:12,642
I wonder, would I be out of line if I asked
you to come back into government...

1413
01:52:12,810 --> 01:52:14,310
...work for the State Department?

1414
01:52:14,478 --> 01:52:15,978
Out of the question, sir.

1415
01:52:16,146 --> 01:52:17,855
I've got a stack of papers to grade.

1416
01:52:18,023 --> 01:52:21,317
The money involved would be substantial.

1417
01:52:21,985 --> 01:52:24,570
You'd be surprised how much
a good teacher can earn.

1418
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:26,739
PRESIDENT:
Oh, gosh, I know.

1419
01:52:26,907 --> 01:52:30,034
And I am working on it,
but it's for next term.

1420
01:52:30,869 --> 01:52:34,914
Before I go, sir,
there is a small favor I'd like to ask.

1421
01:52:35,082 --> 01:52:36,541
Welcome to Larry King Live.

1422
01:52:36,708 --> 01:52:39,502
Tonight we seek closure
in the matter of Leland Perkins...

1423
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:42,547
...indicted on six counts of high treason.

1424
01:52:42,714 --> 01:52:46,592
Joining us tonight
is CIA Section Chief Walter Hodge.

1425
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,177
He's in Langley, Virginia.

1426
01:52:48,929 --> 01:52:50,638
At our studios in New York City...

1427
01:52:50,806 --> 01:52:53,808
...intelligence analyst
Jack E. Wadsworth.

1428
01:52:54,643 --> 01:52:58,354
And in our studios here tonight
is Pittsburgh native Mitchell Henessey...

1429
01:52:58,522 --> 01:53:00,398
...who, at a surprise press conference...

1430
01:53:00,566 --> 01:53:03,526
...was singled out
by the president of the United States...

1431
01:53:03,694 --> 01:53:05,278
...for his role in this affair.

1432
01:53:05,446 --> 01:53:07,905
As the expression goes, "That ain't hay."

1433
01:53:08,073 --> 01:53:10,616
-Thanks for coming.
-Thank you, Mr. K, for having me.

1434
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:14,412
KING: Mitch, you have had
one hell of a Christmas Eve...

1435
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:18,624
...and we have heard from our reporter
Carla Krebs, on the scene in Niagara Falls...

1436
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:21,335
...when she heard this story,
she didn't believe it.

1437
01:53:21,503 --> 01:53:24,547
Well, what, uh, Carla failed to realize,
Mr. King...

1438
01:53:24,715 --> 01:53:28,217
...is that I'm always frank
and earnest with women.

1439
01:53:28,385 --> 01:53:29,552
In New York, I'm Frank.

1440
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:31,888
In Chicago, I'm Earnest. Ha-ha-ha.

1441
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:40,480
CAITLIN:
Good boy.

1442

[SIGHS]

1443
01:53:49,072 --> 01:53:51,866
Yeah, I could just sit out here forever.

1444
01:53:52,034 --> 01:53:53,659
Couldn't you?

1445
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:30,931
