00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,890
The, er... position is for a secretary.

5
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,010
Then the agency shouldn't
have given you my name.

6
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,890
My typing and shorthand isn't good enough.

7
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,810
- Assistant, then.
- TYPEWRITER CLACKS

8
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,970
With some minor secretarial duties.

9
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,570
I sent her all the details. She chose you.

10
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,050
Really?

11
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,530
You're a teacher?

12
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,130
Games mistress, yes.

13
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,570
Teachers are good at organising.

14
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,770
Mrs Owen is expecting a lot of guests.

15
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,490
Whereabouts in the country?

16
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,140
The Devon coast. Soldier Island.

17
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,080
The coast?

18
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,250
Audrey's been telling me about
it from her magazines --

19
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,730
haven't you, Audrey?

20
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,090
Some Hollywood film star was
supposed to have bought it,

21
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,610
but no, it's Mr and Mrs Owen.

22
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,010
You've met them?

23
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,490
No, everything by letter.

24
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,210
An island?

25
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,650
By the sea?

26
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,370
Islands are generally by the sea.

27
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,040
The box, if you please, Audrey.

28
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,050
Erm... I... I don't...
Maybe I'm not suited...

29
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,290
You are who she wants.

30
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,730
And it's very well-paid.

31
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,250
There's a permanent position
on offer, if you fit the bill.

32
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,300
- Yes, but...
- For immediate expenses.

36
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,220
In the West End?

37
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,100
And will I be credited in the programme?

38
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,530
Ladies and gentlemen!

39
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,380
Silence, please!

40
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,060

I'm Miss Claythorne.

50
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,330
Mrs Owen's secretary.

51
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,090
Are you Mr Narracott?

52
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,650
Ain't no-one else holding the
sign. Already taken two over.

53
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,690
Fussy old maid and some flashy young lad.

54
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,860
Been in and out of this harbour
like a fiddler's elbow.

55
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,840
Sea dogs have their own etiquette.

56
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,450
Well, good afternoon.

57
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,930
General MacArthur.

58
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,090
Good Lord! What an honour to meet you.

59
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,570
- Wargrave.
- Justice Wargrave?

60
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,010
The honour's all mine, sir.

61
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,850
Retired from justice now.

62
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,410
Mr...?

63
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,730
Lombard. Philip.

64
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,010
And you, sir?

65
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,400
Davis.

66
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,200
Are you coming, or not?

67
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,810
Well... shall we?

68
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,210
This way, just up here...

69
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,960
Good afternoon!

70
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,480
Welcome to Soldier Island.

71
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,660
Right. Come along.

72
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,810
Sorry, is there a problem?

73
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,360
Well, that's as far as
my fee will take me, sir.

74
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,770
Oh, for God's sake...

75
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,570
Er... Davis?

76
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,960
Davis?

77
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,450
I'd be grateful...

78
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,040
Of course.

79
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,450
Well, Rogers...

80
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,690
Our hosts -- when can
we expect to meet them?

81
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,740
We should be a full house by tonight, sir.

82
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,770
Ah, afternoon.

83
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,490
Tony Marston.

84
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,450
Well, I look forward to
meeting you all at dinner.

85
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,330
A stiff G&T in my room.

86
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,370
Sir.

87
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,330
Did Mrs Owen leave any
instructions for me?

88
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,050
- I'm the secretary.
- Only to ensure that you were comfortable

89
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,690
and had everything you
wished for, Miss Claythorne.

90
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,010
Now, if the gentlemen would follow me,

91
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,660
Mrs Rogers will escort the lady.

92
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,090
Well, thank you, Davis...

93
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,970
Did my friend, Mrs Culmington
-- Mrs Constance Culmington --

94
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,130
did she change her plans, do you know?

95
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,650
No, I'm afraid I don't.

96
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,690
Mmm! Ridiculously vague.

97
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,210
Well, I'm sorry. I only
just recently got the job.

98
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,570
No, no, no, no. Not you, Miss Claythorne.

99
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,210
I mean, this whole arrangement.

100
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,530
The Owens invited me here to meet
my friend and she's not even here.

101
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,500
Very strange. Very strange indeed.

102
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,580
- Can I help you? Here.
- Oh, too kind.

103
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,500
HE SNIFFS

104
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,220
GHOSTLY MOAN ECHOES, MACARTHUR GASPS

105
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,180
Leave me alone.

106
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,370
Look at the state of you.

107
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,170
I've got to baste my beef.

108
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,650
And my souffles, Thomas,
what about my souffle?

109
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,290
Well, I can't dress her, can I?

110
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,820
Go on.

111
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,000
Was it a childhood affliction?

112
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,760
Your eyes?

113
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,210
No, madam.

114
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,330
Came on all suddenly.

115
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,530
Oh... Shock, maybe? Sudden change?

116
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:26,680
Begging your pardon, madam, I don't know.

117
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,530
You must know.

118
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,380
Begging your pardon, madam, I don't.

119
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,410
I always think it's rather a weakness,

120
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,620
to be so affected by something
in one's circumstances.

121
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,300
Rather indulgent, almost vain.

122
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,010
We must be strong, Mrs Rogers,
especially in these times.

123
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,130
We must be valiant...

124
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,780
.. and virtuous.

125
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,660
And we must be Englishwomen.

126
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,370
Yes, madam.

127
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,560
And a little advice...

128
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,860
.. in future, a splash
of Eau de Cologne...

129
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,970
.. before you come upstairs
to attend on the ladies.

130
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,610
I appreciate it's hot,
working in the kitchen,

131
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,980
but there's no need to announce
it quite so emphatically.

132
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,120
Beg your pardon, madam.

133
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,250
Tinned goods.

134
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,210
Troops. War. The war.

135
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,930
Tinned goods.

136
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,900
Mmm!

137
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,820
Judge Wargrave, I'm terribly sorry
for the clumsy introduction.

138
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,420
I'm a terrible traveller,
completely lose my bearings.

139
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,450
Are we on time?

140
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,290
Only just.

141
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,820
Ah, sir.

142
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,170
You're ready sooner than we'd anticipated.

143
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,970
- What's up there?
- Just roof space, sir.

144
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,730
Ah, sir -- I've been advised

145
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,770
that the footing isn't
particularly sturdy up there.

146
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,610
Best avoided, lest you
make an unexpected entrance

147
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,490
into one of the bedrooms, sir --

148
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,680
by way of the ceiling.

149
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,050
May I show you to the drawing room, sir?

150
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,370
Perhaps an aperitif, whilst
you await the other guests?

151
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,220
Ah... Mr Davis.

152
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,050
You look like a man who could use a drink.

153
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,300
Hmm! How very congenial.
Perhaps a small... snifter.

154
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,460
Mr Rogers, lead the way.

155
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,740
MURMUR OF CONVERSATION

156
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,970
CLATTER

157
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,340
CLUNK

158
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,140
Miss?

159
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,620
Is there something
you're looking for, Miss?

160
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,920
Because this is the belowstairs, Miss.

161
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,890
For staff.

162
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,730
Well, I am staff.

163
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,970
Miss, we had very strict instructions

164
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,770
that you were to be treated as a guest.

165
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,930
Guests don't come below stairs.

166
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,100
It rather sounds as though
you're asking me to leave.

167
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,000
How many more are you
expecting, with the Owens?

168
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,290
We shall know when they arrive.

169
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,810
And how will you cope,
just the two of you?

170
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,410
Rogers and myself is competent.

171
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,000
More than.

172
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,860
So, if you please?

173
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,020
Well done, girl.

174
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,060
What an idyllic evening.

175
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,730
The sky!

176
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,650
How can one not believe in a creator?

177
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,250
Davis.

178
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,410
Emily Brett.

179
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,330
Edward Armstrong.

180
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,300
There's one in my room, too.

181
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,370
I imagine there's one in every room.

182
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,090
Well... Soldier Island. It makes sense.

183
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,610
It's amusing.

184
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,540
I have a strong suspicion our
hosts are inclined to whimsy.

185
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,090
I cannot comment on our hosts.

186
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,280
Good little secretary.

187
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,210
Excuse me.

188
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,460
We've got off on the
wrong foot, haven't we?

189
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,490
But you do have very pretty legs.

190
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,780
- It would have been remiss not
to admire them. - Mr Lombard...

191
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,260
.. you seem to be under the impression
that I am a particular kind of woman.

192
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,920
And I assure you that I am not.

193
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,010
I do not like to be looked at.

194
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,530
I get instincts about people.

195
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,400
I've an instinct about you.

196
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,160
I think you're pretending.

197
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,610
DOOR OPENS

198
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,890
A drink, Mr Marston?

199
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,740
Pink gin. Pink as a virgin's blush.

200
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,660
- Didn't catch your name.
- Philip Lombard.

201
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,220
Irish. You must know the Corkerons.

202
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,930
Great chums of mine.

203
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,730
Endlessly simpatico.

204
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,610
Anyone who's anyone knows them.

205
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,600
WARGRAVE AND MACARTHUR CHUCKLE OUTSIDE

206
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,290
Are you a betting man, Lombard?

207
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,730
It depends.

208
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,250
At some point this evening,

209
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,170
one of those crumbling old roaks
will start talking about the war.

210
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,610
And then he'll ask us both if we aren't
damned sorry to have missed the last one

211
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,690
and how we should be gung ho
to do our duty in the next.

212
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,290
Not that there's going to be a next one.

213
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,890
There's always a next one.

214
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,500
So, how about it? A bet?

215
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,600
The odds are too short.

216
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,400
WARGRAVE AND MACARTHUR CHUCKLE OUTSIDE

217
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,490
Listen to them. Clinging on.

218
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,770
They think they still mean something

219
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,580
but nobody at all would notice,
or care, if they just...

220
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,340
I'm going to be exceptionally
charming to them.

221
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,250
Oh, all right, Miss Claythorne.

222
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,620
If it'll make you happy,
I'm sorry for staring.

223
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,050
Mr Lombard,

224
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,040
I doubt you're ever sorry for anything.

225
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,120
Smart girl.

226
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,180
GONG STRIKES

227
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,130
Ladies and gentlemen, lobster souffle.

228
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,490
I hope it isn't too rich.

229
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,280
I always dine so modestly at home.

230
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,240
I won't, thank you.

231
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,930
Thank you.

232
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,250
We've met before, you know?

233
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,210
Oh, forgive me, my
memory is not what it was.

234
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,690
Perhaps you gave evidence before me?

235
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,290
No, no, it wasn't that, I'd remember that.

236
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,410
It's something else...

237
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,210
It'll come to me.

238
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,210
I'm not at all sure about these.

239
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,650
They look very... pagan.

240
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,770
They're the ten little soldiers.
You know, from the poem.

241
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,530
Hmm. I know it off by heart.

242
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,490
When I was a little boy, my
nanny used to recite it to me.

243
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,250
I imagine she wanted to
terrify me into being good.

244
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,650
Did it work?

245
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,770
Well, I've always been a stickler, yes.

246
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,610
Stickler for the rules.

247
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,330
I was probably a rather dull boy!

248
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,890
I really can't imagine that, General.

249
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,610
Although, you shouldn't call
it a poem, Miss Claythorne.

250
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,450
It's doggerel.

251
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,210
Poetry should be uplifting.

252
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,890
I agree with you, Miss Brent.

253
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,490
Well, that shows how wrong
first impressions are.

254
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,730
I didn't think you were the type
of gentleman to appreciate poetry.

255
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,580
LOMBARD: Mr Davis has hidden depths.

256
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,690
The souffle is delicious.

257
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,540
Mmm, very light.

258
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,690
In over 40 years in criminal
law, I have come face to face

259
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,410
with the most depraved examples
of mankind and felt no fear.

260
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,130
But I quail in terror, Miss Claythorne,

261
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:38,410
at the thought of young ladies
brandishing hockey sticks.

262
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:43,250
They're not so bad, Judge. A little
over-excited and noisy, sometimes.

263
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,250
Oh, the prerogative of youth.

264
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,330
And I'm sure you set
them a very fine example.

265
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,570
Sometimes, you dread what
filth they're going to serve,

266
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,810
- but this is actually very decent.
- The Owens are always generous hosts.

267
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,770
Friends of yours, Mr Davis?

268
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,170
Business acquaintances.

269
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,850
I'm in tinned goods.

270
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,530
The firm started off
supplying troops with stew.

271
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,810
Tinned goods is what
helped us win the war.

272
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,490
Well, I suppose... I suppose
an army marches on its stomach.

273
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,970
Here we go...

274
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,210
God, I remember that stew.

275
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,690
RAMC, I presume, Dr Armstrong?

276
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,930
That's right.

277
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,450
Clearing stations and then
hospitals in Belgium and France.

278
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,450
Perhaps you're being interviewed as well.

279
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,290
Interviewed, General?

280
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:32,530
Yes, Mr Owen is an amateur, but very
knowledgeable military historian.

281
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,210
He's writing about France,

282
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,090
- about the decisive actions on the Front
in 1917. - (Oh, for God's sake, it's over.)

283
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,330
No, I'm, er... I'm just
here to get away from it all.

284
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,050
Interesting man, Mr Owen
-- and an interesting name.

285
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,690
Ulick Norman.

286
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,530
How funny. Mrs Owen is Una Nancy...

287
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,090
Matching initials.

288
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,850
Must confess, I was a little
worried about the "Ulick".

289
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,860
Given the current climate, it might
be seen as somewhat... Teutonic.

290
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,690
You couldn't hope to meet
a more patriotic man.

291
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,780
And what could be more
English than "Norman"?

292
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,660
Oh, it's magical!

293
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,170
Mrs Rogers has the gift.

294
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,540
She might look like the undead,
but she can definitely cook.

295
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,490
When might we expect the Owens?

296
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,490
Have they not telephoned?

297
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,730
There's no telephone on the island, Madam.

298
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,250
Mr Narracott brings messages,

299
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,850
along with the post and kitchen
supplies every morning.

300
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,250
I imagine tomorrow, he will either
bring a telegram from the Owens,

301
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,640
or they will accompany him.

302
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,010
Ah-ah, Rogers, give that
Narracott chap a couple of bob,

303
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,970
ask him to watch my car.

304
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,810
It's parked up by the harbour.

305
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,050
The Jensen.

306
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,770
Of course, sir.

307
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,220
I shall pass on your
compliments to Mrs Rogers.

308
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,450
Look here, Davis. The Owens...

309
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,770
Are they fun-loving types?

310
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,210
"Fun-loving"?

311
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,450
Yeah, cos there's
something a tad off here.

312
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,100
Now, I had a letter
inviting me to a house party.

313
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,050
Pretty young things, you
know? Champagne, music...

314
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,970
And apart from Lombard, who looks
like he could cut up a bit lively,

315
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,850
the rest of you don't really look
like fun-loving house party types.

316
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,770
No offence.

317
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,530
Your car, the Jensen?

318
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,970
Oh, you saw her? Isn't she a beauty?

319
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,330
I honestly can't imagine loving a person

320
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,730
as much as I worship and adore the Jensen.

321
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,130
You ran me off the road.

322
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,850
No, I didn't.

323
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,860
You ran me off the road.

324
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,090
When?

325
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,170
I was driving along, minding my own
business, when you overtook me --

326
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,890
going God knows how fast --
and you ran me off the road.

327
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,290
Well, I saw someone going
at a pitiful speed...

328
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,610
Now, look here, Marston --

329
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,290
I think an apology and a
handshake between gentlemen

330
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,050
would be just the thing here.

331
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,730
- But I haven't done anything wrong!
- You ran me off the road!

332
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,570
I might have over-taken you, but
my great aunt drives with more zip.

333
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,050
And if you can't control your car,

334
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,850
- then you really shouldn't be
behind the wheel... - You little shit!

335
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,170
You ran me off the road

336
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,690
and then you have the temerity
to tell me it's my fault?!

337
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,250
Careful, old boy. Getting a
little red in the face there.

338
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,610
Gentleman, please! There
are ladies present.

339
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,200
I'm sorry.

340
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,410
It's been a long week.

341
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,370
You're right, General.

342
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,960
A handshake between gentlemen.

343
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,210
Come on, Armstrong. Put it there.

344
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,640
Let's be pals.

345
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,450
Nearly there.

346
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,600
Good work, eh?

347
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,730
Rogers, I'm out of cigarettes.

348
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,490
Yes, sir.

349
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,850
So, what battles were you
involved with, General?

350
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,330
Well, I served on the North West frontier,

351
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,890
in South Africa, and of course, in France.

352
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,660
Win any?

353
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,970
I loathe this convention -- leaving men
to their cigars and their "stories".

354
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,610
Convention, Miss Claythorne,

355
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,100
is what keeps us together in
the face of impending chaos.

356
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,370
Is it time?

357
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,360
You start serving.

358
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,610
No, no. No, I'll pour the coffee.

359
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,570
You must be very busy in the kitchen.

360
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,890
Miss.

361
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,330
Excellent dinner, Mrs Rogers.

362
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,780
The Owens are lucky to have you.

363
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,690
I'll certainly be telling them so.

364
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,610
Thank you, Madam.

365
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,700
TANNOY FEEDBACK

366
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,560
Whereabouts is your school?

367
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,570
I doubt you'd have heard of it.
It's not particularly well-known.

368
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,970
Nor particularly good, either.

369
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,530
Why do you say that?

370
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,090
Otherwise, you would not be needing
employment in the summer months.

371
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,810
Their fees are not high
enough, nor is their pay.

372
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,370
Not that I disapprove of you
seeking employment and being busy --

373
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,020
far from it.

374
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,850
But why teach in a
third-rate establishment,

375
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,290
producing third-rate girls?

376
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,530
Barely worth your time and
attention, I would have thought.

TANNOY: [FEEDBACK] 'Ladies and gentlemen!

Where is this coming from?

393
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:53,410
- 'Anthony James Marston, that you did murder
John and Lucy Coombes...' - Let's go, Rogers.

394
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,050
I never heard of them.

395
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,330

RECORD REVOLVES

403
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,530
Oh... Mrs Rogers?

404
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,890
- She just took a turn.
- I'll go fetch my bag.

405
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,010
- She'll be all right.
- I'll be the judge of that.

406
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,050
- A record?
- It's called Swan Song.

407
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,930
What the hell are they playing at?

408
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,730
Huh? What the hell are they playing at?

409
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,330
- Get off me!
- The damn Owens, what's their game?

410
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,900
Put him down, Marston, he doesn't
know them. He's not Davis.

411
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,890
I'm Blore.

412
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,370
Detective Sergeant William Blore.

413
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,210
How did you know?

414
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,730
Instinct.

415
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,320
I need a drink.

416
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,050
Really! These grotesque,
false accusations!

417
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,370
Indeed, General!

418
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,690
We should wait for the doctor and Rogers.

419
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,770
We should wait until everyone is together.

420
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,660
Well said, Tubs. Let's all
listen to the policeman.

421
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,540
Miss Claythorne?

422
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,450
Here.

423
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,440
It's mild, but it will help you sleep.

424
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,850
I suspect, Rogers, that there
are questions about our hosts

425
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,130
that only you can answer.

426
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,650
Yes, sir.

427
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,330
A few minutes, then, to settle your wife.

428
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,660
Sir.

429
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,400
I told you!

430
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,370
I told you... [SHE WHIMPERS]

431
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,210
Pull yourself together, woman!

432
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:02,260
Stop flapping your trap, you dozy bitch.

433
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,890
Thank you.

434
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,810
Rogers is coming.

435
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,650
Well, Rogers?

436
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,970
See... "On my instructions...

437
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,410
"Put the record on at such a time".

438
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,370
We were told it was to be
a surprise, a party game.

439
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,370
- Some party game!
- But you were in the room with us.

440
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,930
There's a delay on the record.

441
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,180
Somebody went to a lot
of time and expense.

442
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,170
If I'd known what was on the record,

443
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,290
I'd never have been a part of it.

444
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,610
What is said about me
and Mrs Rogers? Never!

445
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,660
Nothing in it, then?

446
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,290
Miss Brady were like family to us.

447
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,680
'We did everything for her.

448
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,370
'She weren't well. Frail as a bird.

449
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,850
'But on account of how she
left us a small legacy...

450
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,250
'Well, some folk will
say anything to hurt.'

451
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,340
MISS BRADY WHIMPERS, GASPS FOR AIR

452
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,300
HE PANTS

453
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,290
There's a lot of jealousy amongst
domestic service, I'm afraid to say.

454
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,570
Below stairs is very
often a nest of vipers.

455
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:35,580
Thank you, Rogers. We'll ring
if we require anything further.

456
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,810
I've had more than my fair share
of lazy and vindictive staff.

457
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:49,160
- I believe Rogers.
- Doesn't make any sense.

458
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:53,690
I've never even met a
John and Lucy Coombes.

459
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,680
Malicious nonsense.

460
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,780
Louise Clees was a surgical patient.

461
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,130
It was risky, there were
complications. Everyone knew that.

462
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,090
But the moment anything goes wrong,
it's "blame the bloody surgeon".

463
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,770
No-one's blaming you, Doctor.

464
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,210
Well, someone is!

465
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,930
Henry Richmond was one of
my finest young officers,

466
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,050
who fell in the pursuit of his
gallant duty for King and Country.

467
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:24,210
It is repugnant that these vile
rumours should be given credence...

468
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,610
Repugnant!

469
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,860
Edward Seton was guilty.

470
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:33,370
I was party to evidence that was
not admissible before the court.

471
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,290
But he was guilty.

472
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,530
The only time I laid hands on
Landor was to put handcuffs on him.

473
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,180
He was a degenerate and a drunk.

474
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,400
He choked on his own puke.

475
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,580
Cyril... The little boy...

476
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,660
I was his governess.

477
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,280
He wasn't supposed to
swim, he wasn't strong.

478
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,900
But he sneaked off and I...

479
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,480
I wasn't a good enough swimmer.

480
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,160
I just wasn't good enough.

481
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,810
I tried.

482
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,200
I really tried to save him.

483
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,980
His poor mother was
broken, she was so broken.

484
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,170
I... I had to be rescued.

485
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,090
I almost drowned.

486
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,370
Who could say something like this?

487
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,650
Some sort of vicious joke.

488
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,450
Well, if that's your sense of humour,

489
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,410
there's something wrong with your wiring.

490
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,010
Time for the funny farm.

491
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,800
It was pinpoint accurate about me.

492
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,960
21 men?

493
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:42,540
I always thought someone would blab.

494
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,890
It's amazing how people get
an attack of conscience

495
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,770
when they're safely
tucked away in their beds.

496
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,980
- FLAMES CRACKLE
- DISTANT SCREAMS

497
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,740
EMILY: You terrible man!

498
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,410
You terrible, terrible man!

499
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,410
It's people like you --

500
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,410
men like you --

501
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,370
that put our missionaries in such danger!

502
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,210
Oh, your missionaries, with
their God and their syphilis!

503
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,890
I am not the only white
killer in Africa, Miss Brent.

504
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,410
Lombard, you, sir, are a bloody butcher!

505
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,770
And I'm holding my hands up to it.

506
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,530
So, either I'm embellishing
a story for shocking effect,

507
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:39,490
or I'm the only one telling the
truth in a room full of liars.

508
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,850
- How dare you!
- Take that back, sir!

509
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,730
WARGRAVE: Enough, please,
ladies and gentlemen. Enough!

510
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,450
What good can it do?

511
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,970
My feeling is that we should retire

512
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,130
and be ready to leave
tomorrow with Mr Narracott.

513
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,770
What if the Owens are with him?

514
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,500
We confront them, but we leave.

515
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:03,060
And despite Mr Lombard's
devastating confession...

516
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,440
.. we are all victims of a cruel hoax.

517
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,930
We shouldn't these dignify these
accusations with any more debate.

518
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,290
- Agreed? - Certainly. - Hear, hear.

519
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:18,060
John and Lucy Coombes -- they
must have been those two kids.

520
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:23,090
I mean, what sort of parents let kids
play out in the dark, for God's sake?

521
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,680
It's completely irresponsible.

522
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,570
I lost my license for six months.
It was a terrific nuisance.

523
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,730
Oh, you were driving, were
you? What a surprise(!)

524
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,520
It was jolly bad luck, that's all.

525
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,700
No, I didn't stand a chance.

526
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,530
Those poor children...

527
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,970
You're a bloody maniac, Marston!

528
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,170
I wasn't even driving that fast.

529
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,650
You can't, not in England.

530
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,010
It's not like the Continent. I mean,
they understand motoring over there.

531
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,130
Say what you like about the Krauts,
but their roads are magnificent.

532
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,370
The Jensen loves them.

533
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:12,090
I can really open her up and let her rip.

534
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,890
HE CHUCKLES

535
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,330
MARSTON WHEEZES, COUGHS

536
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:20,050
- GLASS DROPS - All
right? - He's choking!

537
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,050
MARSTON CHOKES

538
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,170
He's bleeding!

539
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,960
- Get him down!
- Get him off me!

540
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,080
He's dead.

541
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:57,100
(Heavenly father, watch over this
soul in torment and protect us...)

542
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,930
Armstrong.

543
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,520
Come here.

544
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,300
Ah.

545
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,010
Well, perhaps we ought to
get rid of the stimulant,

546
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,810
out of respect to the family.

547
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,370
Don't want to cause a scandal.

548
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,890
It's a police matter now, Doctor.

549
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,040
Same set of rules, if you're posh or not.

550
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,400
Very well.

551
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,250
We're damned, Thomas.

552
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,330
We're damned.

553
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,340
We're going to hell!

554
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,170
SHE CRIES OUT

555
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:28,620
MRS ROGERS SOBS

556
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,580
KNOCKING AT DOOR

557
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,060
Yes?

558
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,930
Who is it?

559
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,540
FLOORBOARDS CREAK

560
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,460
DOOR OPENS

561
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,290
ECHOING: Doctor, please!

562
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,850
Don't touch me.

563
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,040
I know what I'm doing.

564
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,290
KNOCKING AT DOOR

565
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,260
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

566
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,770
Dr Armstrong?

567
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:42,450
Yes? What is it?

568
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,570
Can you come, please?

569
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,760
She's been dead for some hours.

570
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,930
I'll, er...

571
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:10,170
I'll inform the others not to expect
too much in the way of breakfast,

572
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,420
given the circumstances.

573
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,500
No, sir.

574
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,740
Full breakfast will be provided.

575
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,010
Good man.

576
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,860
Best not to dwell. Keep busy.

577
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,770
Dr Armstrong.

578
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,240
I heard you get up.

579
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,770
Has Mrs Rogers got worse?

580
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,970
Somewhat. She's dead.

581
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,770
- Dead?
- Died in her sleep.

582
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,520
It was quite peaceful.
Nothing to be alarmed about.

583
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,490
Wait.

584
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,090
Wait, I, er...

585
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:36,380
I came down here to wait for
you and I saw this. Please.

586
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,620
Bit late for the kiss of life, Tubs.

587
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,250
Smart arse, you are.

588
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,440
Have a sniff yourself.

589
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,970
- There were ten of them.
- From the nursery rhyme, the poem? Yes.

590
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:01,320
Yes. Count them for me,
please, Dr Armstrong.

591
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,330
There are eight, aren't there?

592
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,380
Eight figures for the eight people here.

593
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,970
Tell me I'm right.

594
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,930
Please tell me I'm right!

595
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:17,460
I'm sure there is a perfectly
rational explanation for this.

596
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,930
Almonds.

597
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,850
Almonds be buggered.

598
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,300
Cyanide.

599
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,690
I trust you're not going to
unravel on us, Miss Claythorne.

600
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,280
Hysterical women are so boring.

601
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:46,850
ECHOING: Thank you for trying, thank
you for trying, thank you, thank you,

602
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:51,260
thank you for trying, oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God...'

603
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,250
'I want to swim to the rocks!'

604
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,970
Cyril, darling, you know you
can't. You're not strong enough.

605
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,810
- I am!
- Cyril, behave yourself.

606
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,450
Listen to Miss Claythorne, dearest.

607
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,730
NO!

608
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,090
That's incredibly naughty!
I'm so sorry, Miss Claythorne.

609
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,970
Oh, dear. He's getting all worked up.

610
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,490
Cyril, you'll make yourself ill.

611
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,610
What's all this, now?

612
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,650
Uncle Hugo!

613
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:22,690
I can hear you shouting from
miles away, you young rascal.

614
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,010
Oh, thank heavens -- in the nick of time.

615
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:28,130
Olivia, you look
absolutely radiant, as ever.

616
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:31,740
Empty flattery. I'm completely
raddled and utterly hideous.

617
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,690
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

618
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,610
Hugo, this is Miss Claythorne,

619
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,700
who was doing so much to
help Cyril in the schoolroom.

620
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,660
DOOR SHUTS

621
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:43,020
Have you been for a paddle, General?

622
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,760
What are you, Lombard?

623
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,460
A mercenary?

624
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:53,250
Gun for hire?

625
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,840
A soldier?

626
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:01,650
Not from any army I'd recognise,
but still, a soldier of sorts.

627
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,700
You don't need to worry about what I am.

628
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:07,490
There's always a moment, isn't there?

629
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:12,940
Before the attack, the advance,
the bombardment, the chaos...

630
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,960
A moment of absolute calm.

631
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,690
Listen...

632
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:26,220
Doesn't this feel like that moment?

633
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,340
I was never a man for calm, General.

634
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:39,400
We can't see the harbour from here.

635
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,520
Which means they can't see us.

636
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,200
We are cut off.

637
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,050
Rats in a barrel.

638
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,620
This is the peace before the carnage.

639
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,730
People do not just die for no reason!

640
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:08,050
They die because something
was done to them by someone.

641
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,370
There's a Fenian sat over
there with a bloody gun!

642
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,850
No-one's coming for us. This is the end.

643
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,530
Don't you dare touch my possessions!

644
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,370
What have you got to hide?

645
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:20,050
The whole morning, clearing up guts
-- you've got some right brass neck.

646
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,290
We are all being hunted.

647
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,610
There's someone else on this island,

648
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:28,620
and when I find him, I'm
going to make him number 22.
