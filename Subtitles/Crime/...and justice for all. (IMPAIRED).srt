i'm innocent.

doesn't it ?
yes, jeff, you're innocent.

right.

there's enough
proof, jeff.

it's just that the court
won't accept the proof.

why not ?
well, uh, there's a law--

says that evidence
must be submitted...

have let you out, but

319
00:22:57,242 --> 00:23:01,747
you're a wonderful man,
grandpa, but your son
is a shit.

320
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:09,254
he was born with colic.

i love ya.

322
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:21,266
look at you.
filled out like a man.

323
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:24,269
soon,
you'll look like a lawyer,

324
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,271
and you'll be a lawyer.

325
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:30,275
iama lawyer, sam.

326
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,778
i've been a lawyer
for twelve years.

327
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:43,288
[ sighs ]

328
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,793
so, it's another week,
already ?

329
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,301
[ man ]
do you know jules stouffer ?
[ arthur ]  yes, i do.

330
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,804
-[ man ]  he was a client
 of yours, isn't that right ?
-[ arthur ]  yes.

331
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:02,808
wasn't he originally
represented by alvin burton ?

332
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:06,311
yes, that is correct.
why did he change
representation ?

333
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,814
because i handled him on
an aggravated assault charge.

334
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,316
that's my area,
not burton's area, so--

335
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:15,320
did jules stouffer
express dissatisfaction
with mr. burton ?

336
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,323
no.  not at all.
burton's an excellent lawyer.

337
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,325
you're not going after him,
are you ?

338
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:23,328
we're not going after
anyone, mr. kirkland.
we are simply--

339
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,832
do you know david--
we are simply trying to review
certain accusations,

340
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:31,336
to determine whether or not
they are true, and to, more
or less, clean our own house.

341
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,840
so, please
do not overdramatize
these proceedings.

342
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,344
- it's not
  the mccarthy hearings.
- oh !  that's a relief.

343
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:43,849
so, you're not gonna ask me,
"are you now, or have you
 ever been, a lawyer ?"

344
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,353
that wasn't amusing,
mr. kirkland.

345
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:52,858
- do you know david crebbs ?
- no, it wasn't, miss, um--

346
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:56,361
- packer.
- packer.

347
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,364
this isn't amusing.
it is, however, ridiculous.

348
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,366
yes.
david crebbs ?
i know him.

349
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:04,369
have you ever seen--
[ microphone feeding back ]
is this mike working ?

350
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:10,375
do you know david crebbs ?
why are we using
microphones ?

351
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:15,380
- why don't we just
  talk to each other ?
- this is a hearing.

352
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,884
ah !  yes.
it's a hearing.

353
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:22,387
-do you know jules stouffer ?
- we've already asked that
  question, mr. crenna.

354
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:25,891
oh, we're through
with stouffer ?
how about alvin burton ?

355
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:29,394
do you know david crebbs ?
i already asked that.

356
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,396
what'd he say ?
he said, "yes."

357
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,399
have you ever seen him
intoxicated in court ?

358
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,903
david crebbs has
a speech impediment.

359
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:41,406
now, if you check
your records, you'll see
it's there someplace.

360
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,909
no.
that's the answer
to your question:

361
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,912
no, he doesn't drink.
doesn't drink at all.

362
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,915
at this point,
i would just like to say...

363
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:55,921
that what this committee
is doing in theory
is highly commendable.

364
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:59,925
however, in practice,
it sucks.

365
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:03,428
and i am not going to
answer any more questions.

366
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,440
what do you think
we're trying to do
in there ?

367

no.

368
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:21,947
whatever you may think,
we are not conducting
some kind of, uh,

witch-hunt.
[ sighs ]

370
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:27,452
what are you doing, then ?
well, you might not
be aware of this,

371
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:30,455
mr. kirkland,
but there's a lot of
corruption going around...

372
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,457
that nobody's
doing anything about.

373
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:35,961
do you think your committee's
doing something about it ?
yes, i do.

374
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:40,465
that committee is
a very dangerous farce.

375
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,469
wh-o-oa, mr. kirkland.

376
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:47,472
i spend 14 hours a day
working on that committee.

377
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,474
i don't care how many hours
you spend.
i don't do it...

378
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,977
because it's going
to give me laughs,
understand ?

379
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:54,980
you know what you're going
to wind up accomplishing ?
listen to me.

380
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,482
maybe ruining the careers...
if we don't police
our own activities,

of a few guys who happen to
wipe their ass the wrong way--

about me.
what do you think ?

to have a drink with ?
i think that you're crazy.

what happened ?

that you were involved
in a robbery.

happened is, it was time
to come down on the nigger.

on me.

in the alley.

looked like my dog.

that when asked
what you were doing
in the alley,

00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:14,502
you replied,
"i don't know nothin' about

it's dangerous ?

the public into thinking
you're doing something.

they had the wrong person ?
well, he did.

he told the public defender,

really believed him.

with a deadly weapon.

very crazy jeff mccullaugh
goes to court.

now, the public defender
who's defending him,
he says--

he tells jeff that
he can get him off
if he pleads guilty.

with the judge,

right.  so he pleads guilty,
even though he's innocent.

541
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:56,464
that's right.  however,
the deal was made
with a judge callahan.

that this is the defendant's

01:39:31,548 --> 01:39:34,051
what do you think ?

1429
01:39:34,551 --> 01:39:36,553
that take care
of my legal fees
for the next two years ?

1430
01:39:36,553 --> 01:39:39,056
oh, carl.

1431
01:39:39,056 --> 01:39:42,559
take the pictures.
it's a token
of my appreciation.

1432
01:39:46,063 --> 01:39:48,565
oh, my, my.

1433
01:39:50,567 --> 01:39:55,072
look, arthur, come on.
these photographs
are disgusting,

1434
01:39:55,072 --> 01:39:57,574
but they're not proof
that fleming
raped leah shepard.

1435
01:39:57,574 --> 01:40:01,578
he did it.
the son of a bitch
is guilty.

1436
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:06,083
he's guilty.
okay, okay.
then drop the case.

1437
01:40:06,583 --> 01:40:09,586
i can't.
why not ?

1438
01:40:09,586 --> 01:40:14,091
because the man
with the whip
is blackmailing me.

1439
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:16,093
he's blackmailing you ?
yeah.

1440
01:40:16,093 --> 01:40:18,595
what for ?

1441
01:40:18,595 --> 01:40:23,600
a long time ago, i betrayed
a client's confidence.

1442
01:40:25,102 --> 01:40:28,105
it's a long story, gail.
jesus.

1443
01:40:28,105 --> 01:40:32,109
that's why zinoff
pulled your file.

1444
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:34,611
what do you--
 what do you mean ?

1445
01:40:35,112 --> 01:40:37,614
after you walked out
on the committee,
we did a check on you.

1446
01:40:37,614 --> 01:40:41,118
a check on me ?
yeah.

1447
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:45,622
yeah, zinoff requested it.
i had no idea why.
wait, wait, wait, wait.

1448
01:40:45,622 --> 01:40:49,626
you mean to tell me,
while we were
sleeping together,

1449
01:40:49,626 --> 01:40:53,630
you and the fellas
were making decisions
on my life ?

1450
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:55,632
arthur !
gail, on my life ?

1451
01:40:56,133 --> 01:40:58,135
would you just let me
finish, please ?

1452
01:40:58,135 --> 01:41:00,637
the next thing i knew,
zinoff stepped in,

1453
01:41:00,637 --> 01:41:03,640
he said he wanted
to personally review
your case.

1454
01:41:04,141 --> 01:41:06,143
i swear to god, arthur,
 i had no idea.

1455
01:41:06,143 --> 01:41:09,146
jesus.
this whole thing stinks !

1456
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:14,151
okay, arthur, if you feel
that way about it,
then fight 'em.

1457
01:41:14,151 --> 01:41:18,655
go ahead.
go up against them,
take the consequences.

1458
01:41:18,655 --> 01:41:20,657
the consequences ?

1459
01:41:20,657 --> 01:41:25,162
the consequences are that
i'll be disbarred, gail.
i know that.  that's right.

1460
01:41:25,162 --> 01:41:29,166
i'm a lawyer.
that's all i know.
then do it.  defend fleming.

1461
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:32,669
you'll win the case.
no disbarment, right ?

1462
01:41:32,669 --> 01:41:35,172
you'll end up being
a very important lawyer.

1463
01:41:35,672 --> 01:41:38,175
the judge is guilty...
w-w-wait a minute.

1464
01:41:38,175 --> 01:41:41,178
of beating and raping
a woman.
wait !  you're talking crazy.

1465
01:41:41,178 --> 01:41:43,180
you don't know he's guilty.

1466
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:47,684
you're making an assumption
he's guilty because you hate him
so much, right ?

1467
01:41:47,684 --> 01:41:50,687
even if he is,
what difference does it make ?
come on.

1468
01:41:50,687 --> 01:41:54,691
a defense lawyer has to
defend people who are guilty.
you know that.

1469
01:41:59,196 --> 01:42:04,201
would you defend him ?
if you were me,
would you do it ?

1470
01:42:04,201 --> 01:42:08,705
i would, arthur, 'cause
it's my job, you know ?

1471
01:42:09,206 --> 01:42:14,711
look, you took an oath
to defend your clients
to the best of your ability.

1472
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:18,715
now, if you can't do that,
then get out.

1473
01:43:11,268 --> 01:43:13,770
where'd you get these ?

1474
01:43:13,770 --> 01:43:17,774
i've been carrying 'em around
for a couple of days.

1475
01:43:17,774 --> 01:43:20,277
i'd like to know
what they mean.

1476
01:43:24,781 --> 01:43:27,784
i see the wheels spinning.

1477
01:43:27,784 --> 01:43:30,787
sex photos, sex crime.
is he guilty ?

1478
01:43:30,787 --> 01:43:33,290
is he ?

1479
01:43:39,296 --> 01:43:41,298
yes.

1480
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:47,304
what about the polygraph ?

1481
01:43:47,804 --> 01:43:50,807
the eyewitness ?
how'd you do that ?

1482
01:43:50,807 --> 01:43:53,810
those were taken care of
for me.

1483
01:43:58,315 --> 01:44:04,321
so-- so now you have it.

1484
01:44:08,325 --> 01:44:12,329
well, i'll see you
in court, arthur.

1485
01:44:17,834 --> 01:44:20,337
oh, you forgot these.

1486
01:44:32,849 --> 01:44:34,851
so you're home
on leave.

1487
01:44:37,854 --> 01:44:40,357
arthur's in
the coast guard.

1488
01:44:42,359 --> 01:44:44,361
i don't understand.
he's gettin' worse.

1489
01:44:44,361 --> 01:44:46,863
it depends.
he comes, he goes.

1490
01:44:50,367 --> 01:44:53,870
you didn't come
for three weeks.
he missed you very much.

1491
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:56,873
oh, yeah, well,
i was busy, arnie.

1492
01:44:56,873 --> 01:45:01,378
you know, i had
the trial and all.
i know, i know.

1493
01:45:01,878 --> 01:45:06,383
it's important to you.
but you missed three tuesdays,
so he lost his sense of time.

1494
01:45:08,385 --> 01:45:10,887
you know, arnie,

1495
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:13,890
i don't know what i'd do
if he goes.

1496
01:45:16,393 --> 01:45:18,895
he's the only family
i got.

1497
01:45:18,895 --> 01:45:21,398
he's very proud of you.

1498
01:45:24,901 --> 01:45:28,405
i'm a lawyer
because of him.

1499
01:45:32,909 --> 01:45:37,414
he wanted it for me,
and he made sure i got it.

1500
01:45:37,414 --> 01:45:40,417
to him,

1501
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:45,422
being a lawyer was
the finest thing
you could be.

1502
01:45:46,923 --> 01:45:48,925
[ groaning ]

1503
01:45:50,927 --> 01:45:52,929
[ groaning continues ]
[ knocking ]

1504
01:45:52,929 --> 01:45:55,932
- your honor,
  court's about to begin.
- [ coughing ]

1505
01:45:55,932 --> 01:45:59,436
coming !
[ spits ]
coming !

1506
01:46:11,448 --> 01:46:13,867
[ crowd chattering ]

1507
01:46:29,883 --> 01:46:32,886
you must admit,
she's an attractive woman.

1508
01:46:32,886 --> 01:46:35,389
i wouldn't mind seeing her
again some time.

1509
01:46:35,389 --> 01:46:38,392
you're gonna be fine.
take the stand.
answer simply and directly.

1510
01:46:41,395 --> 01:46:44,898
silence !
all rise !

1511
01:46:44,898 --> 01:46:48,402
all persons having matters
before this court draw near
and give your attention !

1512
01:46:48,902 --> 01:46:51,405
the honorable
francis rayford presiding.

1513
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:54,908
[ coughing ]
be seated !

1514
01:46:57,411 --> 01:46:59,913
so it's really
very simple.

1515
01:47:04,418 --> 01:47:08,422
we have a judge,
a symbol of justice here...

1516
01:47:11,425 --> 01:47:13,927
who's accused...

1517
01:47:13,927 --> 01:47:17,431
of raping and brutally beating
this young girl right here.

1518
01:47:20,434 --> 01:47:24,938
now, we can do
something about it,
and we can do it today,

1519
01:47:24,938 --> 01:47:26,940
and we can do it together.

1520
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:32,946
let's make this
our goal-line stand.

1521
01:47:37,451 --> 01:47:39,953
just give me a verdict
of guilty.

1522
01:47:42,456 --> 01:47:44,458
i need your help.

1523
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,462
thank you.
[ applause ]

1524
01:47:51,965 --> 01:47:56,970
prosecutor's completed
his opening statement.
defense counsel ready ?

1525
01:47:58,472 --> 01:48:00,474
yes, your honor.

1526
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:08,482
your honor, mr. foreman,
ladies and gentleman
of the jury,

1527
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:13,487
my name is arthur kirkland,
and i am the defense counsel...

1528
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:18,992
for the defendant,
judge henry t. fleming.

1529
01:48:22,496 --> 01:48:25,499
now that man over there,
he's the prosecuting attorney,

1530
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:30,003
and he couldn't be
happier today.

1531
01:48:30,003 --> 01:48:33,006
he is a happy man today...

1532
01:48:33,006 --> 01:48:36,510
because today he's going
after a judge.

1533
01:48:37,511 --> 01:48:39,513
and if he gets him--

1534
01:48:41,014 --> 01:48:43,016
if he gets him,
he's gonna be a star.

1535
01:48:43,517 --> 01:48:49,022
he's gonna have his name
in this month'slaw review,
centerfold,

1536
01:48:49,022 --> 01:48:51,024
"lawyer of the month."

1537
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:56,530
now, in order
to win this case,

1538
01:48:56,530 --> 01:48:58,532
he needs... you.

1539
01:48:59,032 --> 01:49:02,536
naturally.
you're all he's got.
believe me.

1540
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:07,541
so he's counting on tapping
that emotion in you which says,

1541
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:11,545
"let's get somebody in power.
  let's get a judge."

1542
01:49:13,547 --> 01:49:15,549
however, these proceedings
are not about that.

1543
01:49:16,049 --> 01:49:21,054
these proceedings are here
to see that justice is done.

1544
01:49:22,055 --> 01:49:26,059
and justice is,
as any reasonable person
would tell ya,

1545
01:49:26,059 --> 01:49:28,562
the finding of the truth.

1546
01:49:28,562 --> 01:49:31,064
and what is
the truth today ?

1547
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:35,569
one truth--
a tragic one--

1548
01:49:35,569 --> 01:49:39,072
is that that girl
has been beaten
and raped.

1549
01:49:39,072 --> 01:49:43,577
another truth is
that the prosecution
doesn't have a witness,

1550
01:49:43,577 --> 01:49:48,081
does not have one piece
of substantiating evidence...

1551
01:49:48,081 --> 01:49:52,586
other than the testimony
of the victim herself.

1552
01:49:54,087 --> 01:49:59,092
another truth is
that my client voluntarily--

1553
01:49:59,092 --> 01:50:01,595
and the prosecution
is well aware of this fact--

1554
01:50:01,595 --> 01:50:04,097
voluntarily took
a lie detector test--

1555
01:50:04,097 --> 01:50:06,099
objection, your honor,
that's inadmissible evidence !
objection !

1556
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:10,103
- come on, arthur.
- he told the truth.

1557
01:50:10,103 --> 01:50:12,606
the jury will disregard
that remark.

1558
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:15,609
polygraph tests
have not been proven
100 percent reliable,

1559
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:17,611
therefore, inadmissible
in a court of law.

1560
01:50:17,611 --> 01:50:19,613
sorry, your honor.

1561
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:25,118
let's get back to justice.

1562
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:29,122
what is justice ?

1563
01:50:29,122 --> 01:50:31,625
what is the intention
of justice ?

1564
01:50:34,127 --> 01:50:38,632
the intention of justice
is to see that the guilty people
are proven guilty...

1565
01:50:38,632 --> 01:50:40,634
and that the innocent
are freed.

1566
01:50:40,634 --> 01:50:44,137
simple, isn't it ?

1567
01:50:44,137 --> 01:50:46,640
only it's not that simple.

1568
01:50:48,141 --> 01:50:52,646
however, it is
the defense counselor's duty...

1569
01:50:52,646 --> 01:50:54,648
to protect the rights
of the individual,

1570
01:50:55,148 --> 01:50:57,651
as it is
the prosecution's duty...

1571
01:50:57,651 --> 01:51:02,656
to uphold and defend
the laws of the state.

1572
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:04,658
justice for all.

1573
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:09,663
only we have a problem here.

1574
01:51:09,663 --> 01:51:13,166
you know what it is ?

1575
01:51:13,166 --> 01:51:16,169
both sides wanna win.

1576
01:51:18,171 --> 01:51:20,674
we wanna win.

1577
01:51:20,674 --> 01:51:23,677
we wanna win,
regardless of the truth,

1578
01:51:23,677 --> 01:51:26,680
and we wanna win
regardless of justice,

1579
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:30,183
regardless of who's guilty
or innocent.

1580
01:51:30,684 --> 01:51:32,686
winning...

1581
01:51:33,687 --> 01:51:35,689
is everything.

1582
01:51:37,691 --> 01:51:40,193
that man there wants
a win so badly today.

1583
01:51:40,193 --> 01:51:43,196
it means so much to him.

1584
01:51:43,697 --> 01:51:46,199
he is so carried away
with the prospect
of winning,

1585
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:51,705
the idea...
that he forgot something...

1586
01:51:52,205 --> 01:51:55,709
that's absolutely essential
to today's proceedings.

1587
01:51:57,711 --> 01:51:59,713
he forgot his case.

1588
01:51:59,713 --> 01:52:04,217
he forgot to bring it.
i don't know.
i don't see it.  do you ?

1589
01:52:04,217 --> 01:52:07,721
the prosecution's case--
he's gotta have one.

1590
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:13,226
not a witness !
not one piece of
substantiating evidence...

1591
01:52:13,226 --> 01:52:17,230
other than the testimony
of the victim herself.

1592
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:19,733
ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

1593
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:22,736

to end all cases.

1594
01:52:22,736 --> 01:52:27,741
[ sighs ]
i have witnesses
for my client.

1595
01:52:27,741 --> 01:52:31,745
i have character references,
testimonials,

1596
01:52:32,245 --> 01:52:35,749
that are backed up
from here to washington d.c.

1597
01:52:35,749 --> 01:52:38,752
- i got lie detector tests--
- [ both ]  objection !

1598
01:52:39,252 --> 01:52:41,254
objection sustained.

1599
01:52:41,254 --> 01:52:43,256
mr. kirkland,
you are out of order !

1600
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:51,264
one thing...
that bothered me--

1601
01:52:51,765 --> 01:52:56,269
the one thing
that stayed in my mind,
and i couldn't get rid of it,

1602
01:52:56,269 --> 01:52:58,772
that haunted me...

1603
01:52:58,772 --> 01:53:00,774
was why.

1604
01:53:02,275 --> 01:53:04,277
why would she lie ?

1605
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:09,282
what was her motive
for lying ?

1606
01:53:09,282 --> 01:53:13,787
if my client is innocent,
she's lying.

1607
01:53:13,787 --> 01:53:15,789
why ?

1608
01:53:17,290 --> 01:53:19,292
was it blackmail ?

1609
01:53:20,293 --> 01:53:23,296
no.

1610
01:53:23,296 --> 01:53:25,799
was it jealousy ?

1611
01:53:25,799 --> 01:53:27,801
no.

1612
01:53:29,302 --> 01:53:34,808
yesterday i found out why.
[ sniffles ]

1613
01:53:39,813 --> 01:53:42,816
she doesn't have a motive.

1614
01:53:45,318 --> 01:53:46,820
you know why ?

1615
01:53:49,322 --> 01:53:51,825
because she's not lying.

1616
01:53:53,326 --> 01:53:55,829
and ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

1617
01:53:57,831 --> 01:54:00,333
