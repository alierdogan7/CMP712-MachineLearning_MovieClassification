Poppin' your cherry.

181
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:10,212
The famous Russian shootings,
huh?

182
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,646
I didn't pull the trigger.

183
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:13,348
Doesn't matter.
You watched two guys get shot

184
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,783
by me.

185
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,985
Don't tear it up
in front of the kid.

186
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:18,587
Why not? I already punched
my psych card, sweetheart.

187
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:19,955
I got the free sandwich next.

188
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,057
- Briggs...
- Yeah. Go.

Everybody on our island

190
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,893

a little head shrinking.

191
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:27,029
It's at the FBI office
downtown, okay?

192
00:07:27,096 --> 00:07:29,298
Next bit of business...

193
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,400
It's from the brass.

194
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:34,102
They want Mikey
on one of your actives.

195
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,773
Oh, that's great.
Give me that.

196
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,775
Mike, upstairs.

197
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:42,645
Yo, taste it.
Just taste it.

198
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,880
- [Sighs] Oh...
- Mix it in. Mix it up.

199
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:46,382
Why you gotta play me
like that?

200
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:47,716
- Mix it up with some sugar.
- How you gonna play me like...

201
00:07:47,784 --> 00:07:48,484
put some sugar on it.
You won't even taste it!

202
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,020
I'm done.

203
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:52,822
I can do it.

204
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,989
I can't just squeeze you
onto something, Mike.

205
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,257
You're too green.

206
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:56,892
You still got
that new-car smell on you.

207
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,494
We kicked ass together
with the Russians.

208
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,463
Mmhmm. You mean
when you almost shot Donnie?

209
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,530
Or when Donnie almost shot you?

210
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:03,031
That's not fair.

211
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:04,299
Listen, I know
your whole case log.

212
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:06,034
Put me on Gutierrez.

He's never met a vice
he didn't like.

I mean, you almost burned
Hector's, for Christ's sakes.

231
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:44,605
Come on, the bureau
wants me on something.

Of course it's about Briggs.

He's just playing the periphery.
He hasn't even met the guy.

for him to get noticed,

00:21:49,586 --> 00:21:50,653
I think I got something
that might help.

529
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:51,754
Come on in, Mike.

530
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:53,088
So one of the things

531
00:21:53,156 --> 00:21:54,189
Bello's looking for
is firepower, right?

532
00:21:54,257 --> 00:21:56,224
I see you read my case file.

533
00:21:56,292 --> 00:21:59,027
Jakes just scored a thousand
armor-piercing bullets.

534
00:21:59,094 --> 00:22:00,495
You think Bello
would be into that?

535
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:02,463
Continue.

536
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,598
You tell Bello that
you got a guy at camp Pendleton

537
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,067
with the bullets... a marine.
That'd be you.

538
00:22:07,134 --> 00:22:09,803
- I've got the look, right?
- You do.

539
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:11,638
So we borrow the bullets
from Jakes

540
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,173
and sell them
to one of Bello's guys.

541
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:14,875
- Eddie, mm-hmm.
- Eddie.

542
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:16,744
Arrest Eddie, flip him,

543
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:19,013
and make him
bring you to Bello.

544
00:22:19,081 --> 00:22:20,515
Ah, and you started off
so strong.

545
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,583
It's too risky.
There's too many moving pieces.

546
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:24,352
If it got back to Bello,
I'd be dead.

547
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,154
But I appreciate the effort.
It's a work in progress.

548
00:22:26,222 --> 00:22:28,356
I'll think about it.

549
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:37,232
Hey, stranger.
What you doing home?

550
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:39,567
Charlie and Mike
helped me spike Bobby's drink.

551
00:22:39,635 --> 00:22:41,336
[Chuckles]
The dreaded spike, huh?

552
00:22:41,404 --> 00:22:44,372
- Mm-hmm.
- Couldn't get it up, huh?

553
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,108
Nope. He got embarrassed
and kicked me out.

554
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:48,176
Third time.
Yeah.

555
00:22:48,244 --> 00:22:50,512
You know, at some point,
the guy's gonna stop drinking.

556
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,381
I know. And then what?
I seriously hate this case.

557
00:22:53,449 --> 00:22:54,716
He's not giving me anything.

558
00:22:54,784 --> 00:22:56,285
He won't talk business
in front of a woman.

559
00:22:56,352 --> 00:22:57,386
Right.

560
00:22:57,454 --> 00:23:00,322
Well, you know,
ease your way out.

561
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:03,825
I should.
But I want him.

562
00:23:03,893 --> 00:23:04,860
I mean, he's such a pig.

563
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:08,496
- Hmm.
- But you're right.

564
00:23:08,564 --> 00:23:12,466
This won't end well for me.

565
00:23:12,534 --> 00:23:16,303
You know, I do still have
a connection with Bobby's crew.

566
00:23:16,371 --> 00:23:18,172
II can't ask you to do that.

567
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,307
You know I owe you plenty.

568
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:23,477
And you didn't ask.

569
00:23:25,714 --> 00:23:28,416
- Thanks, Paul.
- Yeah.

570
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,897
[Knocks on door] Enter.

571
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:44,933
I thought about it.
Your plan's awesome.

572
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:46,301
We get rolling in the morning.

573
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:47,969
What changed?

574
00:23:48,037 --> 00:23:50,005
Mm, told you.
Thought about it.

575
00:23:50,072 --> 00:23:52,841
Tell Jakes.

576
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:08,781
Hey, Jakes,
can I ask you something?

577
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:10,817
- Yeah, man, go ahead.
- Those 5.7s.

578
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:12,418
- Have you filed them yet?
- No.

579
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,219
Would you mind
if I borrowed them?

580
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:15,754
Are you out
of your goddamn mind?

581
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:18,090
It's only for the day.
Briggs will sign for 'em.

582
00:24:18,158 --> 00:24:19,992
You think that makes me
feel better?

583
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,397
Look, levi, one of these
gets out on the streets,

584
00:24:24,465 --> 00:24:26,799
happens to penetrate
the body armor

585
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:29,602
and chest cavity
of an LAPD officer,

586
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,470
I'll be in jail,
getting penetrated

587
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:33,039
in a different cavity,
you feel me?

588
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:34,040
I'll trade you.

589
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:35,174
What do you want?

590
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:38,345
I want you to leave me alone.

591
00:24:38,412 --> 00:24:41,014
I'll do your next round
on the chore wheel.

592
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:42,349
Jakes, come on, man.

593
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:44,318
Let these bullets
do some good in the world

594
00:24:44,385 --> 00:24:48,856
before they're destroyed.
Hmm?

595
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:52,125
All right,
I'll tell you what, levi.

596
00:24:52,193 --> 00:24:54,194
Two.
Two turns on the wheel.

597
00:24:54,262 --> 00:24:56,396
Done.

598
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:58,198
How many rounds you gonna need?

599
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:01,334
All of 'em.

600
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:03,069
[Indistinct chatter]

601
00:25:03,136 --> 00:25:04,404
[Laughs]

602
00:25:04,471 --> 00:25:06,505
We got G.I. Joe
in the house, guys.

603
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:08,340
Reporting for duty, sir.

604
00:25:08,408 --> 00:25:10,142
Right off
the recruitment poster.

605
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,277
Reservist with
the 316th quartermaster company

606
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,679
- at Pendleton.
- Mmhmm.

607
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:14,513
[Southern accent] Manufacturer
donated some bullets

608
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:16,014
for live fire testing.

609
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:17,550
Not all of 'em made it
to the range.

610
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:19,085
Dig it.
Don't depart from it.

611
00:25:19,152 --> 00:25:21,120
Now, look, the bureau boys
worked hard

612
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:22,655
to get this backstop for you.

613
00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:24,323
If Eddie or Bello has
the ability to check,

614
00:25:24,391 --> 00:25:25,658
which I highly doubt,
it'll come up

615
00:25:25,726 --> 00:25:27,326
that you're registered
with the 316th.

616
00:25:27,394 --> 00:25:29,161
Expectin' to see
Bello today, sir?

617
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:30,696
No, no.
It's gonna be Eddie's show.

618
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:32,165
Bello steers clear
of the indictable stuff.

619
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:33,499
Sure.

620
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:34,734
But what is up
with that accent?

621
00:25:34,802 --> 00:25:36,903
Felt quite natural
for the character.

622
00:25:36,971 --> 00:25:39,606
Oh, listen, Mike, you're not
playing curly in <i>Oklahoma,</i>okay?

623
00:25:39,674 --> 00:25:40,707
If it doesn't flow out of you
second nature,

624
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:41,708
you should drop it.

625
00:25:41,776 --> 00:25:43,443
Dropped.

626
00:25:43,511 --> 00:25:45,178
Now, we're gonna have audio
on both of us.

627
00:25:45,246 --> 00:25:46,413
Okay.

628
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:48,549
You and I will go in
with 50 rounds of ammo,

629
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:49,917
test some of the bullets,
and get out of there.

630
00:25:49,984 --> 00:25:51,251
We'll make the sale later

631
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,187
when the odds aren't
so stacked against us.

632
00:25:53,255 --> 00:25:55,189
All right, guys, check it out.

633
00:25:55,256 --> 00:25:57,557
Found a spot a block away
from where you guys are.

634
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:58,792
Closest we can get.

635
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,260
No visual inside, though,

636
00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:02,663
so no sniper love for you guys.

637
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,964
Well, what's the signal
if something goes wrong?

638
00:26:04,032 --> 00:26:08,535
How 'bout "oh, sh... "?

639
00:26:08,603 --> 00:26:11,738
That's good.

640
00:26:11,806 --> 00:26:13,439
Oh, sh...

641
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:32,357
[Gunshots]

642
00:26:35,295 --> 00:26:37,029
Damn, Eddie,
what'd that car do to you?

643
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:38,598
- Hey, Paul.
- [Laughs]

644
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,133
Staying out of trouble,
my friend?

645
00:26:40,201 --> 00:26:41,201
Not so much.
How 'bout you?

646
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:42,803
- You know me.
- I do.

647
00:26:42,871 --> 00:26:43,837
Eddie, this is my guy.

648
00:26:43,905 --> 00:26:45,239
He's a reservist

649
00:26:45,307 --> 00:26:47,776
out of the 316th quartermaster
company at Pendleton.

650
00:26:47,844 --> 00:26:49,244
- Pendleton.
- Yeah.

651
00:26:49,312 --> 00:26:52,815
Yes.

652
00:26:52,882 --> 00:26:54,583
I'm not packin'.

653
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:56,718
- Show me what you brought.
- Oh, yeah.

654
00:26:56,786 --> 00:26:59,054
You and the Mexicans both fire
the 5.7s, right, Eddie?

655
00:26:59,122 --> 00:27:00,889
- Yes.
- I'll tell you what.

656
00:27:00,957 --> 00:27:04,326
Compared to these bad boys,
you're shooting blanks.

657
00:27:04,394 --> 00:27:06,228
What we have here
is a 40-grain

658
00:27:06,296 --> 00:27:09,164
high-performance cartridge
with a tungsten carbide core.

659
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:10,732
A.K.A. cop killers.

660
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,433
Illegal in all 50 states
and Puerto Rico.

661
00:27:12,501 --> 00:27:14,836
Now, feel that missile
right there.

662
00:27:14,904 --> 00:27:16,905
No matter what tactical vest
the other guy's wearing,

663
00:27:16,973 --> 00:27:18,807
touch him with one of those,
he'll be feeling a draft.

664
00:27:18,874 --> 00:27:21,777
We'll see.
Bring out the bears.

665
00:27:21,844 --> 00:27:23,278
- We'll get 'em.
- Bears?

666
00:27:23,346 --> 00:27:27,316
Yes. You know, cops.
Smokey bears.

667
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:30,753
- Oh.
- [Laughs]

668
00:27:30,821 --> 00:27:34,423
That is real body armor.
L.A.'s finest.

669
00:27:37,293 --> 00:27:40,462
Ready?

670
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,897
Shoot.

671
00:27:41,965 --> 00:27:44,366
[Gunshots]

672
00:27:51,841 --> 00:27:53,175
What are you trying to sell us?

673
00:27:53,242 --> 00:27:54,576
It's a huge cartridge.

674
00:27:54,644 --> 00:27:55,877
The kick will throw
your aim off a bit, that's all.

675
00:27:55,945 --> 00:27:57,312
You're saying we can't shoot?

676
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,614
No, Eddie,
of course you can shoot.

677
00:27:58,681 --> 00:28:03,652
No, you can't.

678
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:06,454
Team one, we might be
going in hot.

679
00:28:09,024 --> 00:28:12,828
We can't shoot?
Is that what you are saying?

680
00:28:12,895 --> 00:28:15,797
Not without some instruction.

681
00:28:15,865 --> 00:28:17,999
Come on, Mike.

682
00:28:19,435 --> 00:28:22,504
- [Laughs]
- [Chuckles]

683
00:28:22,572 --> 00:28:26,308
- We don't need a lesson.
- May I?

684
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:29,378
Is he going to shoot me?

685
00:28:29,445 --> 00:28:31,913
If he does, I'll shoot him.

686
00:28:34,183 --> 00:28:35,683
What the hell is he doing?

687
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,927
These bullets are longer
and heavier

688
00:28:45,994 --> 00:28:47,328
than the ones
you're used to shooting.

689
00:28:47,396 --> 00:28:48,896
The recoil is gonna
push the nose up,

690
00:28:48,964 --> 00:28:52,066
so you need to aim
underneath your target.

691
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:56,003
[Laughter] Oops.

692
00:29:06,582 --> 00:29:07,916
[Chuckles]

693
00:29:16,525 --> 00:29:19,795
[Chuckles]

694
00:29:19,863 --> 00:29:22,131
So we got a deal?

695
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:23,833
I'll talk to Bello.

696
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,636
But from what I'm seeing,

697
00:29:26,704 --> 00:29:28,905
yes, we have a deal.

698
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,408
So there he was, outnumbered...

699
00:29:41,476 --> 00:29:44,044
one man against five.

700
00:29:44,112 --> 00:29:45,513
That's not a fair fight, right?

701
