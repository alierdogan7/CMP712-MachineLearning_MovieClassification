00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,267
Looks like she's dragged in a real crowd.

2
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,825
Sure does. Looks like
it's going to be a full house tonight.

3
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,951
What do you say
we run in and check out the show?

4
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:28,428
- How are we doing? All set?
- Big crowd, huh?

5
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:31,102
Yeah, and not one of them
has got a pot to piss in.

6
00:01:31,188 --> 00:01:35,623
I let myself get talked into this benefit.
I could be making real money tonight.

7
00:01:35,706 --> 00:01:37,696
Let's get this thing started.

8
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:43,455
(cheering)

9
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:50,536
(announcer) And now, back home again,
the one, the only Ellen Aim!

10
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,486
I love you, Ellen.

11
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:16,718
# Lying in your bed on a Saturday night
sweating buckets and it's not even hot

12
00:02:16,805 --> 00:02:19,398
# But your brain has got the message
and it's sending it out

13
00:02:19,484 --> 00:02:22,235
# To every nerve
and every muscle you've got

14
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:24,959
# You've got so many dreams
that you don't know where to put them

15
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,838
# So you'd better turn a few of 'em loose

16
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,512
# Your body's got a feeling
that it's starting to rust

17
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,952
# You'd better rev it up and put it to use

18
00:02:34,036 --> 00:02:40,029
# And I don't know how I ever thought
that I could make it all alone

19
00:02:40,113 --> 00:02:45,821
# When you only make it better
and it better be tonight

20
00:02:45,911 --> 00:02:47,661
# I'll be there for you tonight

21
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,740
# Even if you don't have anywhere to go
you go down on the pedal, ready to roll

22
00:02:52,826 --> 00:02:57,533
# And your speed is all you'll ever need
All you'll ever need to know

23
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:01,534
# Darlin', darlin', you and me,
we're going nowhere slowly

24
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:04,373

25
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,211
# There's nothing wrong
with going nowhere, baby

26
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:12,927
# But we should be going nowhere fast
It's so much better going nowhere fast

27
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:25,403
# Stalking in the shadows
by the light of the moon

28
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:28,160
# It's like a prison and the night is a cell

29
00:03:28,248 --> 00:03:30,919
# Going anywhere
has gotta be heaven tonight

30
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:34,121
# Cos staying here has gotta be hell

31
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:36,717
# Dying in the city
like a fire on the water

32
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:39,520
# Let's go running on the back of the wind

33
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:42,035
# There's gotta be some action
on the face of the earth

34
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,032
# And I gotta see your face once again

35
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:51,872
# I don't know where I ever got
the bright idea that I was cool

36
00:03:51,956 --> 00:03:57,311
# So alone and independent
but I'm depending on you now

37
00:03:57,394 --> 00:04:02,907
# And you'll always be the only thing
that I just can't be without

38
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:07,697
# And I'm out for you tonight
I'm coming out for you tonight

39
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:10,017
# Even if you don't have anywhere to go

40
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:12,538
# You go down on the pedal
and you're ready to roll

for the chance to be last

00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:59,833
# Godspeed! Speed us away!

52
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:05,916
# Godspeed! Godspeed!

53
00:05:05,998 --> 00:05:11,308
- # Godspeed! Speed us away!
- # We're going nowhere fast

54
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:14,143
- # Godspeed!
- # Going nowhere fast

55
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:16,983
- # Godspeed!
- # Going nowhere fast

56
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:20,778

# Godspeed! Speed us away!

61
00:05:33,623 --> 00:05:35,612
(cheering)

62
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:06,873
Now!

63
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:14,074
What the hell are you doing?

64
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:32,423
What are you guys doing?
Hey, we don't want no trouble.

65
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:41,060
Put me down! No!

66
00:06:41,147 --> 00:06:45,184
Put me down! You bastards, put me down!

67
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:48,172
No! No! Let me go!

68
00:06:48,264 --> 00:06:50,014
Put me down!

69
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:54,292
(screaming)

70
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:56,973
Help me!

71
00:07:19,128 --> 00:07:21,162
(siren)

72
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:23,203
Get him!

73
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:39,266
- Goddamn son-of-a-bitches.
- Hang a 180.

74
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:43,386
What's with that guy?

75
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:51,220
- Watch out.
- These guys are gonna pay.

76
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:59,577
Someone save me!

77
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:03,699
Stop it! Stop it!

78
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:07,693
Stop it!

79
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,302
- Can I help you?
- Coffee.

80
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:27,063
- Cream and sugar?
- Just black.

81
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:41,581
(wolf whistle)

82
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:07,885
You know how to come through a door.
What are you trying to prove?

83
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:10,846
We just came down from King's Park
looking for a good time.

84
00:11:10,928 --> 00:11:14,361
You guys already missed
all the excitement. The party's over.

85
00:11:14,447 --> 00:11:18,482
The Roadmasters are hungry,
and when they're hungry,

86
00:11:18,564 --> 00:11:20,280
they eat.

87
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:22,636
The Bombers
have brought this act through.

88
00:11:22,722 --> 00:11:26,713
- All you're doing is looking like punks.
- Is that right?

89
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,358
We're just gonna
have to mess the place up.

90
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,427
(china and glass smash)

91
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:38,472
And after we mess your place up,
maybe we'll mess you up.

92
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:45,538
You got a problem with this, pretty boy?

93
00:12:01,381 --> 00:12:03,574
Try it again, punk.

94
00:12:30,287 --> 00:12:32,164
Come on.

95
00:12:38,242 --> 00:12:40,231
Go on, go home.

96
00:12:46,758 --> 00:12:49,907
- What do you think of my new car?
- Looks great.

97
00:12:49,996 --> 00:12:51,872
Sell it and buy me a new window.

98
00:13:14,863 --> 00:13:16,739
Tom, come on, slow down.

99
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:19,812
Reva, there is no point stealing a car
and not wringing it out.

100
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:34,611
- When are you going to grow up?
- Why should I? This is more fun.

101
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:38,287
Let me give you some news. The
Bombers and this guy Raven Shaddock,

102
00:13:38,371 --> 00:13:40,121
they stole Ellen Aim.

103
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,847
- How the hell did that happen?
- (police siren)

104
00:13:42,928 --> 00:13:45,805
- Oh, shit.
- Goddamn cops.

105
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:11,344
OK, what do you think this is? We don't
go for that speeding here. Your licence.

106
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,391
Sorry, officer, I must've left it at home.

107
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:18,178
Tom Cody, it's been a couple of years
since I've had any trouble out of you.

108
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:21,544
Ed, I came home to visit my big sister.
You won't have any trouble.

109
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:25,097
Glad to hear it. We don't need somebody
coming here to give us a hard time.

110
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:27,618
Come on, Ed, he just got back.
Give him a break.

111
00:14:27,706 --> 00:14:31,298
Yeah, I'll give him a break.
Get out of here, Cody.

112
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:35,212
Any more driving like that
and I'll give you a ticket.

113
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:37,097
Asshole.

114
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:52,247
Who the hell does that guy think he is?

115
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:56,768
He's always been a real badass.
I busted him a couple of years ago.

116
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:59,646
He had a pistol
in the glove compartment of his car.

117
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:01,208
Real punk, huh?

118
00:15:01,289 --> 00:15:05,279
He belongs in jail
with all the other delinquents.

119
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:27,828
Sure I'm not going to be
cramping your style with any guy?

120
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:31,223
Not tonight. I bring one in now and then
but there's nothing steady.

121
00:15:31,312 --> 00:15:35,461
- I never find the right one.
- I ain't much luck in that department.

122
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:39,904
Look, Tom, you were close with Ellen.
She wasn't like those tramps you ran with.

123
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:43,500
- Reva, it didn't work out, OK?
- Somebody figured how to make it work.

124
00:15:43,586 --> 00:15:46,178
- She's been living with a guy, Billy Fish.
- Who?

125
00:15:46,264 --> 00:15:49,732
He's done some rock joints in the Battery.
Started managing her.

126
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,539
Yeah, she was always interested
in going someplace.

127
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:54,612
Tom!

128
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,770
- She's not just your old girlfriend.
- What do you want?

129
00:15:58,858 --> 00:15:59,607
You know.

130
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:04,132
You want me to rescue an old girlfriend
shacked up with another guy? Thanks.

131
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,036
- Tequila.
- Hey, Tom! Tom Cody!

132
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,507
A long time, pal.
How's your hammer hanging?

133
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,475
- How's it going, Clyde?
- Not so hot.

134
00:16:38,558 --> 00:16:42,627
I got beat up trying to save your old girl.
I could have used a little help.

135
00:16:42,715 --> 00:16:46,752
You should have been there, Tom.
It would've been like the old days.

136
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,663
We'd have kicked ass.

137
00:16:48,753 --> 00:16:52,186
Hey, bartender, do you want to shoot
the shit or get me another drink?

138
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,817
Hey, would you get a load of this honey?
She thinks she owns the place.

139
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:58,579
I'm just trying to get myself a drink, pal.

140
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:01,225
Well, maybe you've
already had enough, babe.

141
00:17:01,305 --> 00:17:03,613
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Do I look like it?

142
00:17:03,704 --> 00:17:07,741
Maybe you ought to pay up. You've
been driving up a tab here all night.

143
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:10,574
- We're not big on credit.
- Are you saying I can't pay?

144
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,208
Yeah, let's see the colour of your money.

145
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:18,414
- There, happy.
- Yeah, but now I don't like your face.

146
00:17:19,896 --> 00:17:22,852
You know, everywhere I go,
there's always an asshole.

147
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:34,166
- Hey, have you got any preferences?
- I've always been a tequila man.

148
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,792
Let's get out of here.

149
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:48,160
My name's McCoy. I'm a soldier. At least,
I was up until a year ago. I ran out of wars.

150
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:51,276
- Yeah, what's your spec?
- Motor pool, nothing fancy.

151
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,952
- If it's got wheels, I can drive it and fix it.
- That's funny. I just got out.

152
00:17:56,037 --> 00:17:59,630
- Been R & R ever since.
- Yeah, how did you like the army?

153
00:17:59,715 --> 00:18:03,069
I liked shooting the guns,
but I didn't win no medal.

154
00:18:04,753 --> 00:18:06,026
Hey!

155
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:09,626
- Is that your car?
- Yeah.

156
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,027
- Nice.
- I know. I just picked it up.

157
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:17,746
Hey, Cody. That's your name, right? Cody.

158
00:18:17,826 --> 00:18:20,941
- Yeah.
- You got a spare bed?

159
00:18:21,824 --> 00:18:23,654
You want a quick tumble, huh?

160
00:18:25,462 --> 00:18:30,452
You may have a rough time with this one
and I don't wanna hurt your feelings.

161
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,449
You're not my type.

162
00:18:32,538 --> 00:18:35,846
Yeah, I guess it figures.
I ain't had much luck with women lately.

163
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:39,722
Yeah, you'll live. Something tells me
that getting girls ain't your problem.

164
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:43,282
- Maybe some other time.
- I doubt it, but anything's possible.

165
00:18:43,732 --> 00:18:46,325
Hey, look.

166
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:50,197
About the spare bed. I'm just passing
through. I don't know anybody.

167
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:53,323
I'm between jobs and last time I heard,
hotels cost money.

168
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:58,435
Get in.

169
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:14,634
My sister's got the bedroom. I've got
the spare. That puts you on the couch.

170
00:19:14,716 --> 00:19:18,263
- Thanks, man, I appreciate it.
- Yeah, no sweat.

171
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:31,501
There you go, McCoy.
I'll see you in the morning.

172
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:37,062
- Hey, you always walk around packed?
- I told you, I'm a soldier.

173
00:19:37,144 --> 00:19:40,180
Well, don't go pointing
that thing at me. I wouldn't like it.

174
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,855
I don't go pointing it
unless I'm gonna use it.

175
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:44,931
Yeah, right.

176
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:15,435
# Take a look at my eyes

177
00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:19,674
# No' you can't hide the truth

178
00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:23,878
# You don't get by on pride

179
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,952
# lt'll run over you

180
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:32,875
# But since you let me down
I'm hard to be around

181
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:38,266
# I don't know what I'm gonna do
lt'll never be you

182
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:43,065
# Never be you

183
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:45,139
(knocking)

184
00:20:46,948 --> 00:20:52,338
OK, you got it. I'm gonna go and get her.
But I ain't doing it for nothing.

185
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:55,938
Tell this Mr Billy Fish to meet me
at the diner tomorrow at 12.00.

186
00:20:56,024 --> 00:20:58,935
Me and him
are going to talk some business.

187
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:01,694
And there's a girl I picked up
sleeping on the couch.

188
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:05,691
- Give her some coffee in the morning.
- How come she's in the front room?

189
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:07,768
Why don't you go ask her?

190
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:30,676
Hey, Pete!

191
00:21:32,684 --> 00:21:35,516
Hey, I really needed a place to stay.
Thanks for the sofa.

192
00:21:35,603 --> 00:21:39,798
Oh, that's OK. You're the first girl
Tom ever brought home that used it.

193
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,632
Sometimes it helps a guy out
if you don't make it so easy.

194
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:46,869
He could use a little help in that direction.
He ought to meet a few more like you.

195
00:21:48,397 --> 00:21:50,783
Fella came through here
a couple of months ago.

196
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:54,992
Tapped out, had to part
with this outfit after a card game.

197
00:21:55,074 --> 00:21:58,143
Real unhappy about it too
because it's all custom stuff.

198
00:21:58,231 --> 00:22:01,778
Tom wasn't going for being
number two to her music.

199
00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:06,144
So he took off. He was crazy about Ellen.
He's the kind that doesn't like to admit it.

200
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:07,706
Sure, I know the type.

201
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:14,499
Some people who never talk about their
feelings got 'em deeper than anybody.

202
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,379
Others never talk
about them cos they ain't got any.

203
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,005
- What's your story?
- Me? Just looking for work.

204
00:22:50,684 --> 00:22:52,638
- You must be Billy Fish.
- Yeah.

205
00:22:52,722 --> 00:22:55,393
So what gives? Make it fast,
my time is valuable.

206
00:22:55,482 --> 00:22:58,040
You want Ellen Aim back.
I'm gonna get her.

207
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,270
- You and what army?
- I can see you two will get along just fine.

208
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:06,707
- I want ten grand.
- Easy, all you gotta do is earn it.

209
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:12,186
I'll earn it, and you're gonna help. Reva
told me you used to live in the Battery.

210
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:16,626
I started out there. It's the shits. I wouldn't
go back to that dump if you paid me.

211
00:23:16,711 --> 00:23:19,825
You're goin'. I need somebody
who knows their way around.

212
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,740
I don't think so. It's not my scene.

213
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:25,898
If you want your meal ticket back,
get in the car, otherwise the deal is off.

214
00:23:25,986 --> 00:23:28,656
Cody, you sound pretty dumb,
but nobody's that dumb.

215
00:23:28,744 --> 00:23:32,974
I'm the one paying you. That means
you go get her and bring her back to me.

216
00:23:33,062 --> 00:23:38,088
You smart guys always figure you can
hire a bum like me to do your dirty work.

217
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:41,647
- Well, not this time.
- Can you really get her back?

218
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:44,375
You got a better volunteer?

219
00:23:54,091 --> 00:23:57,525
All right, I'll go.
She's real important to me.

220
00:24:09,962 --> 00:24:12,396
The Battery is gonna be
nothing but trouble.

221
00:24:12,481 --> 00:24:15,438
Yeah? Well, I'm getting paid for it.
Right, Fish?

222
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,952
- That's right, Cody.
- Cut me in, I'll back you up.

223
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:20,949
- I don't think so.
- We're not taking no skirt along.

224
00:24:21,037 --> 00:24:24,549
- Look, I don't think you can handle it, OK?
- What do I gotta do?

225
00:24:24,636 --> 00:24:27,273
People don't have written references
for this work.

226
00:24:27,354 --> 00:24:29,309
You should know that, Cody.

227
00:24:30,272 --> 00:24:33,660
I need the job. I'm plenty good enough
and I ain't gonna let you down.

228
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,898
Listen, skirt, let me make it simple
for you. Take a hike.

229
00:24:39,068 --> 00:24:41,738
All right, I'll cut you in
for ten per cent but get this.

230
00:24:41,826 --> 00:24:47,057
You're working for me. I tell you to do
something, you do it, no more, no less.

231
00:24:47,144 --> 00:24:49,815
And if you start dragging your ass,
I'm sending you home.

232
00:24:49,902 --> 00:24:51,970
- I got it.
- What is this? Get serious.

233
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:55,289
I'm not paying you to take
some sweetie-pie along for company.

234
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:57,368
You drive.

235
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:01,852
Don't worry about it. They always hire
bums like me for jobs like this.

236
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:28,237
I'll take you to where the Bombers
hang out, but I'm not taking any risks.

237
00:25:28,323 --> 00:25:31,073
I'm not paying you to add thrills to my life.

238
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,718
You've got a big mouth.

239
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,949
Butch, I buy and sell people
more valuable than you every day.

240
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:40,108
It's hard to figure out what's more
pathetic, the way you talk or dress.

241
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:43,948
Let me tell you. These clothes
are worth more than you make in a year.

242
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:46,830
I can see working with you two
is gonna be a real dream.

243
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:09,138
If they've got her anywhere, it's Torchie's.
It's a knockdown joint, no class.

244
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,131
I used to book bands in there. It's in
the middle of a big factory. It's the shits.

245
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:16,731
You'll love it, McCoy. Just your style.
OK, Cody, what's the plan?

246
00:26:16,816 --> 00:26:19,045
How do you figure to handle these guys?

247
00:26:19,135 --> 00:26:22,284
Kill Bombers and we'll be in worse shape
than we're already in.

248
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:27,491
I don't have to kill anybody. Motorcycles
don't run when you shoot holes in them.

249
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:56,994
Some neighbourhood. Everything's dead.
What a place to come to.

250
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:59,634
Keep going straight
then turn left under the bridge.

251
00:26:59,714 --> 00:27:03,991
- What, are you giving the orders now?
- I know my way around, remember?

252
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:08,221
I'll take care of the orders. Get under
the bridge, pull over and kill the lights.

253
00:27:41,813 --> 00:27:44,200
# Well, one bad stud moved
in my neighbourhood

254
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,847
# Well, one bad stud moved
in my neighbourhood

255
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:53,884
# He's big and, man,
I know he ain't no good

256
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:57,196
# He don't wear no hat,
and, Lord, he don't wear no shoes

257
00:27:58,165 --> 00:28:02,280
# He don't wear no hat,
and, Lord, he don't wear no shoes

258
00:28:02,362 --> 00:28:06,353
# He just hangs on the corner
singing old country blues

259
00:28:06,441 --> 00:28:08,509
# Well, one bad stud

260
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,828
# One bad stud

261
00:28:10,918 --> 00:28:14,669
# One bad stud
One bad stud

262
00:28:14,755 --> 00:28:17,985
# I said, one, one, one, one
One bad stud

263
00:28:19,193 --> 00:28:22,865
# If he likes your baby,
you can kiss your baby goodbye

264
00:28:23,351 --> 00:28:27,137
# If he likes your baby,
you can kiss your baby goodbye

265
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,220
# Cos the girls all love him
like a schoolboy loves his pie

266
00:28:31,307 --> 00:28:34,900
# He loves his whiskey,
he loves his rock'n'rye

267
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:39,421
# Yes, he loves his whiskey,
he loves his rock'n'rye

268
00:28:39,503 --> 00:28:43,778
# You know it takes ten bottles
to make that fool get high

269
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:46,577
# Well, one bad stud...

270
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,840
You're making things
real hard on yourself.

271
00:29:11,926 --> 00:29:16,280
You act nice, you and me fall in love
for a week or two, and then I let you go.

272
00:29:16,364 --> 00:29:18,352
Nobody gets hurt.

273
00:29:19,403 --> 00:29:22,597
You see? I ain't such a bad guy.

274
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:27,354
I just get excited around pretty girls.

275
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:39,181
# Well, one bad stud

276
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:41,545
# One bad stud

277
00:29:41,631 --> 00:29:45,303
# One bad stud
One bad stud

278
00:29:45,388 --> 00:29:47,618
# I said, one, one, one, one

279
00:29:47,947 --> 00:29:49,698
(music climaxes)

280
00:30:10,496 --> 00:30:13,485
From now on, any mistakes
and I'm making you walk home.

281
00:30:13,573 --> 00:30:18,769
- Walk around here? I'd get killed.
- You got it. What about you, McCoy?

282
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:22,122
Are we gonna do it
or are we gonna talk about it?

283
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,199
All right.

284
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,706
The main drag is around here somewhere.

285
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:48,988
- What the hell's that?
- I guess you don't know who I am.

286
00:30:51,635 --> 00:30:53,431
Things have got funny around here.

287
00:30:53,514 --> 00:30:57,265
All kinds of strangers
sneaking through the alleys.

288
00:30:57,351 --> 00:31:01,137
What the hell are we talking
to this creep for? Let's get outta here.

289
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:04,742
My gosh, you're scared.
What's even funnier, you're afraid of me.

290
00:31:04,827 --> 00:31:07,258
Trying to get away from you.
We've got business.

291
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:10,495
Oh, you're dumb. And you're short.

292
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:13,016
- Real short.
- (she laughs)

293
00:31:13,782 --> 00:31:17,489
- You're after that girl, aren't you?
- What makes you say that?

294
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,217
You're down a back alley
at night with a bunch of guns.

295
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:22,414
You here to give the Battery
a coat of paint?

296
00:31:22,498 --> 00:31:25,011
- Where are they keeping her?
- Torchie's.

297
00:31:25,097 --> 00:31:28,167
- Don't tell 'em I told you, though.
- Pay him.

298
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:31,643
- Yeah, pay me.
- I'm not gonna pay this jerk.

299
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:35,689
Shithead, give him some of your money
or I'll give him some of your money.

300
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:38,158
Don't call me shithead.

301
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:42,241
You've gotta keep moving forward.
That's the point of things. I appreciate it.

302
00:31:42,328 --> 00:31:44,316
You could buy some soap.

303
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:49,837
I don't need this guy to tell me she's
at Torchie's. I said she was at Torchie's.

304
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:51,720
I am a shithead.

305
00:32:12,953 --> 00:32:16,828
OK, Fish, head back to the car.
I want you in that doorway in 15 minutes.

306
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:20,617
- And I mean 15 minutes.
- They'll notice me in a second there.

307
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:23,220
I'll give them other things to worry about.

308
00:32:23,307 --> 00:32:25,501
What about her?
She was supposed to drive.

309
00:32:25,586 --> 00:32:29,894
Get moving. You better be ready
when we get there.

310
00:32:34,141 --> 00:32:38,179
- Do you trust him or are you desperate?
- Take the front entrance. I'll go topside.

311
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:41,454
If you can work your way upstairs, fine.
If not, I'll handle it.

312
00:32:41,537 --> 00:32:44,731
Just what I always wanted to do, Cody.
Take on the Bombers.

313
00:33:05,725 --> 00:33:07,714
Hey, baby!

314
00:33:22,196 --> 00:33:24,184
(shouting)

315
00:33:30,272 --> 00:33:34,466
# I've been around the world
And every man bleeds the same

316
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:40,855
# But when the lights are dim
You never know who's to blame

317
00:33:43,425 --> 00:33:49,133
# I don't want no scars to show
I don't want no one to know

318
00:33:49,222 --> 00:33:53,133
# So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows

319
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:58,295
# No other place for me to go

320
00:33:58,377 --> 00:34:01,413
# No other place for dying slow

321
00:34:01,495 --> 00:34:05,043
# So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows

322
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:14,719
# I've been around the world
I'll take credit for the things I've done

323
00:34:16,408 --> 00:34:20,556
# But when the lights are dim
I'm not the only guilty one

324
00:34:22,804 --> 00:34:28,796
# I don't want no scars to show
I don't want no one to know

325
00:34:28,882 --> 00:34:32,156
# So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows

326
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,230
Hey! Hey! How are you doing, babe?
Come around here much?

327
00:34:36,318 --> 00:34:39,308
- Only for some action.
- You're talking to the right guy.

328
00:34:39,396 --> 00:34:41,147
- Says who?
- Says me.

329
00:34:41,235 --> 00:34:45,465
- I like a guy that's got confidence.
- All right.

330
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:53,904
# I've been around the world
And every story ends the same

331
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:57,656
(whistle)

332
00:35:02,543 --> 00:35:08,331
# I don't want no scars to show
I don't want no one to know

333
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,536
# So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows

334
00:35:12,618 --> 00:35:17,053
That way's the card game. We're going
down here. We've got a party to go to.

335
00:35:17,696 --> 00:35:19,685
# No other place for dying slow

336
00:35:21,215 --> 00:35:24,807
Check it out, baby. This is the party room.
How do you like it, huh?

337
00:35:24,893 --> 00:35:28,201
Had a lot of good times here
so let's party, huh?

338
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,406
Hey, killer.

339
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:34,161
- Can I take my jacket off first?
- You can take off whatever you want.

340
00:35:34,248 --> 00:35:39,524
All right... Now listen to me, buddy.
There is just one thing I want you to do.

341
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:42,640
- That is to keep quiet.
- Come on, babe, is this thing loaded?

342
00:35:42,722 --> 00:35:45,918
We'll play a game you Bombers will like.
It's called Lights Out.

343
00:35:46,001 --> 00:35:50,867
# No place for me to go
No other place for dying slow

344
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:54,107
# So I'll be killing time

345
00:35:54,197 --> 00:35:57,107
# Just killing time

346
00:35:57,194 --> 00:36:00,230
# So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows

347
00:36:17,465 --> 00:36:19,454
Knock, knock.

348
00:36:52,088 --> 00:36:53,918
(commotion)

349
00:36:54,726 --> 00:36:59,353
Go ahead and take that money, sweetie.
You better pray you get out of the Battery.

350
00:36:59,443 --> 00:37:03,320
- I don't think she's after the money.
- (distant gunshot)

351
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,304
Get out of here!

352
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:40,855
Poker's a real interesting game
when you've got all the best cards.

353
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,614
Next time, right in your nuts, pal.

354
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,119
Guys, it's been a slice.

355
00:38:08,568 --> 00:38:10,443
- Who are you?
- I'm a big fan.

356
00:38:10,526 --> 00:38:12,321
Come on. Let's go.

357
00:38:15,523 --> 00:38:17,318
Who is that guy?

358
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,113
What the hell's going on here?

359
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,836
Move it, move it!

360
00:38:34,554 --> 00:38:36,543
- Which way?
- Follow me.

361
00:38:48,186 --> 00:38:51,256
Jesus, am I glad to see you?
I thought you were gone forever.

362
00:38:51,345 --> 00:38:54,573
- This is no time to check out the sights.
- I'm gonna run these guys.

363
00:38:54,664 --> 00:38:56,618
- I'm staying with you.
- Stay in the car.

364
00:38:56,703 --> 00:39:00,057
Stay with your boyfriend.
McCoy, meet me at Grand St underpass.

365
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,412
If we don't see you, Cody, have a nice life.

366
00:39:57,831 --> 00:40:02,822
Can't you drive this car any faster? I don't
want any Bombers sneaking up on us.

367
00:40:02,907 --> 00:40:07,819
- Where's Grand St? I never heard of it.
- Turn it off, Fish, you sound pathetic.

368
00:40:15,141 --> 00:40:16,937
Well...

369
00:40:18,061 --> 00:40:21,812
Looks like I finally ran into someone
that likes to play as rough as I do.

370
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:25,523
- Yeah, this must be your lucky night.
- I'm lucky?

371
00:40:25,615 --> 00:40:27,924
I guess maybe I am.

372
00:40:28,015 --> 00:40:31,924
You're dumb, real dumb,
if you think you can pull this off.

373
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:35,720
I think you're forgetting something.
I got the gun.

374
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:38,802
I can get guns, smart guy, lots of 'em.

375
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:44,279
- Now, why don't you tell me your name?
- Tom Cody. Pleased to meet ya.

376
00:40:46,205 --> 00:40:48,081
I'll be coming for her.

377
00:40:48,845 --> 00:40:50,753
And I'll be coming for you too.

378
00:40:50,842 --> 00:40:53,310
Sure you will, and I'll be waitin'.

379
00:41:41,816 --> 00:41:44,283
A couple of minutes
and then we get out of here.

380
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:48,650
- What are you talking about?
- Saving our ass. We've a lot to live for.

381
00:41:48,732 --> 00:41:50,881
He got me.
I'm not going back without him.

382
00:41:50,971 --> 00:41:54,040
Don't worry, he's getting paid
a lot of money to look after Raven.

383
00:41:54,129 --> 00:41:56,164
- What money?
- Do you think it's for love?

384
00:41:56,249 --> 00:42:00,525
You think he's doing this cos he's a fan?
He's getting paid. He takes his chances.

385
00:42:00,606 --> 00:42:02,754
Hey, too bad, Billy.

386
00:42:02,846 --> 00:42:06,836
Looks like Ellen's old flame
decided to show up.

387
00:42:23,394 --> 00:42:25,190
OK, we're on the move.

388
00:42:26,793 --> 00:42:30,180
- What is this old flame stuff?
- Ellen used to go with Cody.

389
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,501
Real hot'n'heavy from what I heard.
Know what I mean?

390
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:36,579
- Is she kidding?
- Let's not get into it now, OK, Billy?

391
00:42:36,668 --> 00:42:38,657
Hard news, huh, shorty?

392
00:42:58,058 --> 00:43:01,650
Cody, we've had our differences
but it looks like we've got it made now.

393
00:43:01,735 --> 00:43:04,328
We just zoom along here
then we're home and dry.

394
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:08,007
I got news for you. It ain't that simple.
We've got to bury the car.

395
00:43:08,091 --> 00:43:12,481
- Bury the car? What?
- He means "get rid of it", stupid.

396
00:43:12,569 --> 00:43:14,638
Get rid of the car? What's wrong with it?

397
00:43:14,728 --> 00:43:17,718
Is this what I'm paying you for,
these brilliant ideas?

398
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:21,080
Why don't we hand ourselves
over to Raven and ask him to shoot us?

399
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:52,546
You two go ahead.
I want to talk alone with Tom for a minute.

400
00:43:52,628 --> 00:43:56,538
What are you talking about?
What are you going with him for?

401
00:43:56,627 --> 00:44:00,742
I don't like the way this looks. I'm paying
the bills. How about some respect?

402
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:08,218
- What do you want to talk about?
- I've got a lot to say.

403
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:12,291
No, you don't. You have nothing
to say to me. Go talk to your boyfriend.

404
00:44:12,378 --> 00:44:16,687
What was I supposed to do? I had work.
Things were starting to happen for me.

405
00:44:16,775 --> 00:44:20,130
- Yeah, so bye-bye, Tom, right?
- You took off and joined the army.

406
00:44:20,215 --> 00:44:23,329
Forget all this. It's history.
From now on, I'm just like you.

407
00:44:23,412 --> 00:44:25,322
I do what I'm good at. I do it for money.

408
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:29,800
- Is that why you came and got me?
- Right. Billy Fish is paying me ten grand.

409
00:44:29,889 --> 00:44:33,402
- I can't believe you'd do that.
- You'd better get used to the idea.

410
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:38,801
- Wonder what they're talking about.
- Who says they're talking?

411
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:42,670
- Cute.
- It's just a joke. You know what I mean?

412
00:44:43,402 --> 00:44:45,437
How big a thing do you think they had?

413
00:44:45,521 --> 00:44:49,512
- From what I hear, it was real major.
- Well, she's with me now.

414
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:54,828
Right, against a big, tough, good-looking
guy like you, Cody don't stand a chance.

415
00:45:02,752 --> 00:45:07,742
- I hope you two straightened things out.
- Yeah, we got a lot straightened out.

416
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:12,582
- It was a real eye-opener.
- I think I hurt your girlfriend's feelings.

417
00:45:13,147 --> 00:45:19,139
What does he mean? What did he say?
Did he say anything about me? Tell me.

418
00:45:38,775 --> 00:45:41,131
# I'm tired

419
00:45:42,857 --> 00:45:45,770
# I'm thirsty

420
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,939
# I'm wild-eyed

421
00:45:50,942 --> 00:45:54,095
# In my misery

422
00:45:55,585 --> 00:45:57,382
# Timeless

423
00:45:59,107 --> 00:46:02,464
# In your finery

424
00:46:03,629 --> 00:46:06,544
# A high price

425
00:46:07,551 --> 00:46:11,149
# For your luxury, yeah

426
00:46:13,275 --> 00:46:16,508
# Sorcerer

427
00:46:16,597 --> 00:46:21,037
# Who is the master?

428
00:46:21,121 --> 00:46:25,161
# Man and woman on a star stream

429
00:46:25,243 --> 00:46:29,797
# In the middle of a snow dream

430
00:46:29,885 --> 00:46:32,799
# Sorcerer

431
00:46:32,887 --> 00:46:36,643
# Show me the high life

432
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:41,641
# Come over

433
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:45,932
# Let me put you on ice

434
00:46:51,498 --> 00:46:53,296
# I'm tired

435
00:46:55,181 --> 00:46:59,061
# When I need you badly

436
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:01,934
# Wild-eyed

437
00:47:03,425 --> 00:47:07,500
# In the middle of a dream

438
00:47:08,308 --> 00:47:10,106
# Timeless

439
00:47:12,711 --> 00:47:16,149
Hey, hi, you guys.
Where are you guys going?

440
00:47:16,234 --> 00:47:18,828
- We're nobody, going nowhere.
- Nobody goes nowhere.

441
00:47:18,914 --> 00:47:24,230
Knock it off, we're not interested
in conversation, OK, moron?

442
00:47:24,317 --> 00:47:27,834
I know you.
I love your stuff so much. I really do.

443
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,675
Look, if you love me so much,
go away and leave us alone.

444
00:47:30,762 --> 00:47:33,994
No, look, I'm your biggest fan.
Let me go with you.

445
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:36,440
And I tell you, you gotta get off the street.

446
00:47:36,526 --> 00:47:40,439
The cops know the guys that
hit the Battery are coming through here.

447
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:43,442
Shit. We've gotta get a new set of wheels.

448
00:47:43,531 --> 00:47:49,324
Great, we just got rid of the old wheels.
Wonderful leadership, Cody.

449
00:47:57,419 --> 00:48:00,377
What's the matter with you?
Are you looking to get run over?

450
00:48:00,459 --> 00:48:03,771
- Me and my friends need a lift.
- So what? This ain't no muni bus.

451
00:48:03,862 --> 00:48:05,978
- We need a lift real bad.
- Look.

452
00:48:06,063 --> 00:48:12,222
Let me make it real clear. Nobody tells me
where to take my bus. You dig?

453
00:48:14,109 --> 00:48:19,139
We're very flexible. We'll take you where
you want to go. You just say the word.

454
00:48:19,232 --> 00:48:21,950
You folks just hop right in.
Make yourselves at home.

455
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:24,308
I'm driving.

456
00:48:24,395 --> 00:48:27,068
Bird, what the hell are you doing?

457
00:48:27,156 --> 00:48:30,434
Get off this bus. Oh, man.

458
00:48:44,247 --> 00:48:48,162
Hey, how are you guys doing? Don't
worry, we're not gonna hurt you none.

459
00:48:48,249 --> 00:48:53,406
That's great. Oh, I'm glad to hear that.
We're the Sorels. I'm Bird.

460
00:48:53,493 --> 00:48:57,612
These are my associates. This is Lester.
My man BJ. And that's Reggie.

461
00:49:00,817 --> 00:49:04,016
- Aren't you Ellen Aim?
- That's right. It's Ellen Aim.

462
00:49:04,098 --> 00:49:07,330
Hey, Ellen, do you guys need an opener?
We're good.

463
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,538
- We are.
- We can't seem to get anything going.

464
00:49:10,621 --> 00:49:14,583
I handle the management and the
booking. Shut up and leave Ellen alone.

465
00:49:14,665 --> 00:49:17,419
- What did he say?
- I know how tough it can be.

466
00:49:17,506 --> 00:49:21,421
- Baby, you don't even begin to know.
- What did I tell you guys? Cool it.

467
00:49:27,512 --> 00:49:28,502
Hey!

468
00:49:28,593 --> 00:49:31,870
If you've got any chance
of missing the cops, it's through here.

469
00:49:32,755 --> 00:49:35,873
- Yeah, so what are our chances?
- Horrible.

470
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:38,950
- And terrible.
- That's just great.

471
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:41,555
Look, we don't want to mess
with Ardmore cops.

472
00:49:41,642 --> 00:49:45,522
They busted me and threw my ass right
in jail because I wouldn't pay 'em off.

473
00:49:45,604 --> 00:49:48,118
- What did they bust you for?
- Disturbing the peace.

474
00:49:48,205 --> 00:49:52,520
- They said I got out of line in some bar.
- Great. I love a girl with class.

475
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:28,107
- This is great.
- You want to help change this tyre?

476
00:50:28,189 --> 00:50:31,102
Changing flat tyres isn't
exactly my line of work, dear.

477
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,466
If that's the case,
then why don't you shut up?

478
00:50:33,552 --> 00:50:35,350
(mocking grumble)

479
00:50:40,236 --> 00:50:44,869
I wish I could write songs. I just can't
figure out how to do it right, like you do it.

480
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:49,033
I can't figure out how you work out
the rhymes and the melodies.

481
00:50:49,121 --> 00:50:52,911
Somebody else writes the songs.
Billy buys or steals them. I can't write.

482
00:50:53,003 --> 00:50:56,202
- I always thought those were your songs.
- I just sing 'em.

483
00:50:56,286 --> 00:51:00,680
Yeah, but when you sing 'em, you make
it yours. That's the way it is, right?

484
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:02,567
I guess so. Who knows?

485
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:07,247
The famous Sorels sure put
a lot of money into that bus.

486
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:09,564
I didn't know you had a thing with Ellen.

487
00:51:09,654 --> 00:51:13,285
You better get some smarts.
Adjust to the fact you're out of the picture.

488
00:51:13,377 --> 00:51:16,814
You see, I do things for her,
things a guy like you could never do.

489
00:51:16,898 --> 00:51:19,971
Things that matter in the real world.

490
00:51:24,143 --> 00:51:28,775
You know, the only trouble with kicking
the shit out of you is it would be too easy.

491
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:38,903
Keep your hands off the suit, buddy.

492
00:51:41,873 --> 00:51:45,345
Come on, hurry the hell up
with that flat tyre. Let's get going.

493
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:49,317
# Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three, two, one

494
00:51:49,518 --> 00:51:53,115
# Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three, two, one

495
00:51:53,201 --> 00:51:57,434
# Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three, two, one

496
00:51:57,522 --> 00:52:01,758
# Remember when you didn't love me

497
00:52:01,846 --> 00:52:05,442
# Now all the time you're thinking of me

498
00:52:05,528 --> 00:52:09,681
# If life is great, you're all I'm living for

499
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:13,286
# This is my countdown to love

500
00:52:13,371 --> 00:52:16,843
# Oh, this is my countdown to love

501
00:52:18,416 --> 00:52:21,932
# You are the one love in my life

502
00:52:22,018 --> 00:52:25,534
# I know you feel that way too

503
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:30,176
# Oh, what a thrill
when I'm holding you near

504
00:52:30,262 --> 00:52:34,019
# All of my wild dreams come true

505
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:38,947
# Forever more you'll be my lover

506
00:52:39,028 --> 00:52:42,578
# Because for me
there'll never be another

507
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:46,630
# Together forever
we'll be as one

508
00:52:46,713 --> 00:52:48,909
- (laughs) Pretty good, you guys.
- # This is my countdown to love

509
00:52:51,074 --> 00:52:53,225
- # This is my countdown to love
- Cody.

510
00:52:53,316 --> 00:52:57,756
Ellen, Baby Doll, get down in the back.
Fish, McCoy, we work for the Sorels.

511
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,153
- Fish, you're the manager.
- I'm way ahead of you, Cody.

512
00:53:02,241 --> 00:53:05,758
I'll handle this. I'll talk us through.

513
00:53:19,372 --> 00:53:22,970
Hey, guys, how's it going?
I'm the bus driver here for the Sorels.

514
00:53:23,055 --> 00:53:26,173
We're on our way to a gig
at an after-hours joint.

515
00:53:26,256 --> 00:53:30,297
- The Sorels, the singers. You know 'em?
- No, never heard of 'em.

516
00:53:30,378 --> 00:53:34,214
- You know what's going on here?
- All I know is we're running real late.

517
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,295
Babe, some outfit broke into the Battery
and burned it down.

518
00:53:37,383 --> 00:53:40,296
- Really?
- Knock off the crap, will ya?

519
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:44,427
Anybody that goes into the Battery and
does some damage deserves a medal.

520
00:53:44,508 --> 00:53:47,467
- Let me tell you how we look at it.
- Cut the shit, OK?

521
00:53:47,549 --> 00:53:49,906
You guys have got a big job to do.

522
00:53:49,991 --> 00:53:54,144
Now, let us through or do you want
to come to a financial arrangement?

523
00:53:54,233 --> 00:53:58,912
- What do you think, Harry?
- What we've got here is a model citizen.

524
00:53:58,995 --> 00:54:01,875
I knew you guys talked my language.

525
00:54:05,681 --> 00:54:08,275
Keep it coming.

526
00:54:08,361 --> 00:54:11,673
- Just take a big bite.
- That's right.

527
00:54:11,763 --> 00:54:17,317
- There's some integrity left in the force!
- You are too anxious to buy us off.

528
00:54:17,407 --> 00:54:20,719
- Spade musicians and a wad of money.
- (all) Spade?

529
00:54:20,808 --> 00:54:23,643
All right, everybody off the bus.

530
00:54:26,252 --> 00:54:28,721
All right. Now, this is
how we're going to play it.

531
00:54:28,813 --> 00:54:33,684
You're going to walk off this bus
like there's nothing wrong. Get me?

532
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,339
- All right, down on the ground.
- Do it now!

533
00:54:42,422 --> 00:54:44,458
- All right. OK.
- Get on with it.

534
00:54:46,585 --> 00:54:50,705
Don't worry about it, fellas.
We'll be out of your face in no time.

535
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:55,260
Some of you have got cute little asses.
A shame to blow them off.

536
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:57,625
- Get down.
- Holy shit.

537
00:54:59,032 --> 00:55:01,467
- (wild cheering)
- All right.

538
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:11,750
Come on, man, let's get outta here.

539
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,638
Let's go.

540
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:16,199
(shouting)

541
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:32,483
- Go! Go!
- (shouting)

542
00:55:32,572 --> 00:55:37,127
Shut the hell up! McCoy, pull down
a back alley. We need to dump the bus.

543
00:55:37,216 --> 00:55:39,525
First he dumps the car and now the bus.

544
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:47,931
Code 99. Code 99.
Blockade across on Ardmore.

545
00:55:48,022 --> 00:55:50,218
- Over here.
- Suspects armed and dangerous.

546
00:55:50,302 --> 00:55:52,977
Repeat, armed and dangerous.
Broke blockade.

547
00:55:53,065 --> 00:55:57,583
Heading north on Ardmore.
Cannot pursue. Do you copy?

548
00:55:57,667 --> 00:56:00,706
Goddamn it, this is the blockade
at Ardmore. Come back to me.

549
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,349
Whoa!

550
00:56:17,438 --> 00:56:19,236
(sirens)

551
00:56:32,609 --> 00:56:34,600
- Move over.
- Faster.

552
00:56:44,294 --> 00:56:47,925
- We had $1,000 in that bus.
- I lost my clothes. The luggage is gone.

553
00:56:48,017 --> 00:56:50,487
- All the sheet music is gone.
- This is great.

554
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:54,209
- On our way to the Richmond. No bus.
- You shouldn't have stopped.

555
00:56:54,302 --> 00:56:55,701
I...

556
00:57:12,032 --> 00:57:14,706
He ain't a real social kind of guy, is he?

557
00:57:14,794 --> 00:57:18,072
Really?
Gee, I think he's a real sweetheart.

558
00:57:18,156 --> 00:57:20,386
Cut him some slack. He was there for you.

559
00:57:20,477 --> 00:57:22,069
Yeah, he earned his money.

560
00:57:22,158 --> 00:57:25,550
You've got a funny way of sayin' thanks
when someone saves your ass.

561
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:30,159
Why don't you go and sit with your pal
Billy? I guess he's more your kind of guy.

562
00:57:30,244 --> 00:57:32,394
Yeah, I think maybe I will.

563
00:57:46,173 --> 00:57:51,044
Don't worry, babe.
Everything is going to be OK from now on.

564
00:57:52,298 --> 00:57:54,095
We're gonna be great.

565
00:58:24,637 --> 00:58:27,105
Reva, Ellen Aim is back. Tom is with her.

566
00:58:27,197 --> 00:58:29,189
- Is he OK?
- He looked all right to me.

567
00:58:30,478 --> 00:58:32,276
Chief.

568
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,449
Tom.

569
00:58:52,212 --> 00:58:56,572
Aw, Reva, cut it out. We made it.
Everybody's in one piece.

570
00:58:56,656 --> 00:58:59,295
What about that, Ellen? You OK?

571
00:59:01,259 --> 00:59:05,652
- Yeah, I'm all right, I guess.
- She's tired. She's been roughed up.

572
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:09,018
I'm gonna take her back to the hotel
so she can get some rest.

573
00:59:09,103 --> 00:59:11,537
This started because of a gig
in this shithole.

574
00:59:11,624 --> 00:59:15,300
I should have stayed
the hell away from this dump.

575
00:59:15,387 --> 00:59:19,746
- Is that the way you feel about it, Ellen?
- I just want to get away from here.

576
00:59:19,829 --> 00:59:22,743
- Get back on the road.
- Now you're talking, kiddo.

577
00:59:22,832 --> 00:59:26,030
Come on, let's get outta here.

578
00:59:26,113 --> 00:59:30,188
I hate you for taking money
to come and get me.

579
00:59:31,596 --> 00:59:33,872
That's tellin' him, Ellen.

580
00:59:35,758 --> 00:59:37,556
(cheering)

581
00:59:51,728 --> 00:59:55,006
I guess she doesn't like you much.
She doesn't seem thankful.

582
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:59,802
- One thing about you, you catch on quick.
- That's right and I get the job done.

583
00:59:59,893 --> 01:00:03,365
Good. Because I think it's just starting.

584
01:00:04,296 --> 01:00:06,094
(motorcycle)

585
01:00:32,793 --> 01:00:36,707
- What does he want to talk about?
- Tom Cody.

586
01:00:39,637 --> 01:00:42,027
I want Tom Cody.

587
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:48,232
I want to nail his head to the sidewalk
under the marquee that says "Ellen Aim".

588
01:00:48,322 --> 01:00:51,714
And just to prove to you
I'm gonna be a nice guy,

589
01:00:51,805 --> 01:00:54,718
I'm coming in with just two of my men.

590
01:00:54,807 --> 01:00:59,279
After I take care of Cody,
there'll be no more trouble.

591
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:05,167
Do your job, man. Keep the peace.

592
01:01:31,189 --> 01:01:33,577
Hey, Cody, I need a drink.
Let's get outta here.

593
01:01:33,669 --> 01:01:35,980
Maybe I can pick a fight
with that bartender.

594
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:37,950
No, not this time.

595
01:01:46,397 --> 01:01:49,994
Hey, McCoy, look,
I'll get you your money later, OK?

596
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,311
Is that all you've got to say?

597
01:01:52,401 --> 01:01:55,155
Yeah, that's all.
What else do you wanna hear?

598
01:01:55,242 --> 01:01:58,714
- Look, I did real good back there.
- So what? I'm all out of medals.

599
01:01:58,805 --> 01:02:01,400
Besides, you're getting paid.

600
01:02:03,688 --> 01:02:09,608
You know, Reva. Ellen Aim was right
about one thing. Your brother's a jerk.

601
01:02:28,102 --> 01:02:30,664
What's your problem?
Feeling sorry for yourself?

602
01:02:30,744 --> 01:02:35,183
- Don't start on me, Reva.
- She tells you it doesn't mean a thing.

603
01:02:35,267 --> 01:02:37,828
The worst part
is she runs off with Billy Fish.

604
01:02:37,908 --> 01:02:41,869
I didn't ask you to go out and get Ellen
Aim because she looks great on stage.

605
01:02:41,951 --> 01:02:45,548
- What the hell do you care about, then?
- About you.

606
01:02:45,633 --> 01:02:49,708
And this town. If you're gonna fight,
you're supposed to fight for something.

607
01:02:49,795 --> 01:02:54,188
You and Billy Fish are the same.
You're both selfish. All you worry about...

608
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:57,839
- Hi, Ed.
- I came to talk to your brother.

609
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,717
Come on outside.

610
01:03:09,889 --> 01:03:14,566
Raven says he has to face you alone
right here in the Richmond.

611
01:03:14,651 --> 01:03:19,169
I'm ordering you to get out of town, Tom.
I want you on a train tonight.

612
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:23,248
If Raven comes in here to face you,
I'll be waiting for him with a lot of guns.

613
01:03:23,336 --> 01:03:25,487
I'm throwing his ass in jail.

614
01:03:25,578 --> 01:03:28,571
I am not gonna sit around and watch
two maniacs play out

615
01:03:28,659 --> 01:03:31,460
some little game about personal honour.

616
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:33,737
I want you gone.
If you're in town tomorrow,

617
01:03:33,822 --> 01:03:37,897
I'm throwing your ass in jail
right next to Raven.

618
01:03:43,869 --> 01:03:48,021
Look, you did real good
rescuing her, Tom. You surprised me.

619
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:53,586
I didn't think you had it in you. Surprise
me again. Do something else real good.

620
01:03:53,674 --> 01:03:55,745
Be on that train tonight.

621
01:04:26,614 --> 01:04:28,651
- (knocking)
- Yeah, come in.

622
01:04:28,735 --> 01:04:31,808
Hey, I'll get it. Who is it?

623
01:04:31,897 --> 01:04:34,287
Oh...

624
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:40,652
- What the hell are you still doing here?
- I'll see you guys later, all right?

625
01:04:46,066 --> 01:04:50,301
I've been expecting you.
I know what you want. Ten grand.

626
01:04:50,389 --> 01:04:53,062
I'm as good as my word. I pay on time.

627
01:04:53,149 --> 01:04:57,350
You play rough, but you do a good job.
You should do a little more work for me.

628
01:04:57,433 --> 01:05:03,750
Then you'll realise I'm the one with
the brains here and you'll treat me nicer.

629
01:05:03,836 --> 01:05:07,513
Nobody had a hold on me the way you
did. I would have done anything for you.

630
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:13,633
A long time ago, I would have thought
you were worth it. Not any more, babe.

631
01:05:13,723 --> 01:05:17,558
Where do you get off talking to her
like that? She's way out of your league.

632
01:05:17,644 --> 01:05:21,559
This is the grand I promised McCoy.
You can keep the rest.

633
01:05:27,451 --> 01:05:31,526
You know what's wrong with that guy?
He's stupid.

634
01:05:32,734 --> 01:05:36,330
- Sorry, Billy.
- What? Where are you goin'?

635
01:05:37,977 --> 01:05:42,097
Tom! Tom, wait! Tom!

636
01:05:42,179 --> 01:05:44,330
Wait!

637
01:05:44,422 --> 01:05:48,541
What was I supposed to do? I hadn't heard
from you in two years, not even a letter.

638
01:05:48,623 --> 01:05:51,618
What did I do that was so wrong?

639
01:06:06,955 --> 01:06:11,075
You gotta go away. You've fought
enough fights. Let this one go.

640
01:06:11,158 --> 01:06:16,280
- With both of us gone...
- What do you mean, both of us?

641
01:06:16,361 --> 01:06:20,072
I want to go with you.
We could be together.

642
01:06:22,644 --> 01:06:27,323
- You'd really come along with me?
- In two seconds I would.

643
01:06:28,648 --> 01:06:30,445
Please?

644
01:06:55,585 --> 01:06:57,064
Well...

645
01:06:57,144 --> 01:07:00,343
- If it isn't my old pal Tom Cody.
- How's it going?

646
01:07:00,427 --> 01:07:04,308
Great till you got here.
I've been talking things over with Clyde.

647
01:07:04,389 --> 01:07:09,591
- Remember, he and I used to be close.
- Hey, Tom, tequila, right?

648
01:07:15,396 --> 01:07:17,275
There's what I owe you.

649
01:07:19,558 --> 01:07:24,681
You did real good back there.
I couldn't have got her out without you.

650
01:07:24,762 --> 01:07:27,323
Maybe I rode you a little harder
than I should have.

651
01:07:27,403 --> 01:07:32,479
Don't get sentimental on me.
I wouldn't know how to handle it.

652
01:07:44,374 --> 01:07:47,172
Hey, I got a problem with Ellen
I gotta talk to you about.

653
01:07:47,255 --> 01:07:52,047
I understand about these kind of things.
I was actually in love once myself.

654
01:07:52,137 --> 01:07:54,448
- Didn't work out.
- You make bad picks?

655
01:07:54,539 --> 01:07:57,816
He was the worst.
Lied to me all the time. Cheated on me.

656
01:07:57,902 --> 01:08:04,094
- If I run into him, I'll give him your best.
- That was before I was a soldier.

657
01:08:07,827 --> 01:08:12,299
- You're real crazy about Ellen, aren't you?
- I don't know. I guess I am.

658
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:15,145
Nothing wrong with it,
nothing to be embarrassed about.

659
01:08:15,232 --> 01:08:20,627
I ain't embarrassed. Ellen and I are going
in different directions. Nobody's fault.

660
01:08:20,715 --> 01:08:24,312
Maybe you're right. You don't look
like no backup singer to me.

661
01:08:24,396 --> 01:08:29,029
Look, I need your help tonight.
I gotta do something I don't want to do.

662
01:09:11,905 --> 01:09:16,662
- Come on.
- Tom? This is not the Bayside.

663
01:09:16,748 --> 01:09:19,139
There is something I gotta take care of.

664
01:09:20,712 --> 01:09:24,753
Get as far from here as you can.
Run until the Bayside. Hang out there.

665
01:09:24,834 --> 01:09:26,632
Sure, tough guy.

666
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:49,083
- When does this train take off?
- We don't.

667
01:09:49,168 --> 01:09:51,525
Lady, I gotta get moving. It's important.

668
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:54,842
You ain't gonna get there on this train.
Hey!

669
01:09:54,931 --> 01:09:58,483
- Maybe you better think about it.
- The Bombers have gone crazy.

670
01:09:58,575 --> 01:10:01,932
They're doing everything they can
to seal off the Richmond.

671
01:10:26,232 --> 01:10:28,029
Let's go.

672
01:10:42,121 --> 01:10:46,799
What the hell are you doing here, Clyde?
I told everybody to get off the streets.

673
01:10:46,884 --> 01:10:49,603
Yeah, but I wanna see
Raven run from up close.

674
01:10:49,684 --> 01:10:52,200
Just stay out of the way.

675
01:10:58,330 --> 01:11:00,639
- Well?
- Real simple.

676
01:11:00,731 --> 01:11:05,285
There's no showdown. Tom Cody
ain't here and neither is the girl.

677
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:10,131
- I don't get it.
- Get off your bike, Raven.

678
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:16,092
I ain't too crazy about jails, Chief.

679
01:11:17,621 --> 01:11:19,853
I got a better idea for you.

680
01:11:19,944 --> 01:11:21,740
(sounds horn)

681
01:11:36,432 --> 01:11:38,948
Holy shit!

682
01:11:44,318 --> 01:11:47,117
They're coming! They're here!

683
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:08,803
I told your friend Cody
I could get a lot of guns.

684
01:12:08,892 --> 01:12:12,046
Get out of my way. What the hell?

685
01:12:12,135 --> 01:12:16,688
What is this? You think you can ride into
any town and kidnap anybody you want?

686
01:12:16,778 --> 01:12:19,656
Get the hell outta town
and leave these people alone.

687
01:12:45,956 --> 01:12:50,428
- Sorry I'm late.
- I got something special in mind.

688
01:12:50,518 --> 01:12:52,713
I brought them along just for you.

689
01:12:57,161 --> 01:12:59,916
Well, my plan went to shit.

690
01:13:00,003 --> 01:13:01,801
Let's see how you do.

691
01:13:05,126 --> 01:13:06,924
Kick his ass.

692
01:13:14,572 --> 01:13:16,644
(approaching voices)

693
01:13:17,213 --> 01:13:19,010
Come on, kill 'em!

694
01:13:33,303 --> 01:13:35,100
Nice, huh?

695
01:13:35,905 --> 01:13:37,862
(cheering)

696
01:13:45,152 --> 01:13:46,948
Kill him!

697
01:14:19,211 --> 01:14:21,203
Drop him!

698
01:14:21,292 --> 01:14:22,931
Kill him!

699
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,949
Tom!

700
01:16:01,352 --> 01:16:03,150
(cheering)

701
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:19,120
(wild cheering)

702
01:16:37,615 --> 01:16:39,809
Let's get outta here!

703
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:09,867
# No more timing
each tear that falls from my eyes

704
01:17:11,355 --> 01:17:18,948
# I'm not hiding the remedy
to cure this old heart of mine

705
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:25,642
# I can dream about you
if I can't hold you tonight

706
01:17:27,044 --> 01:17:28,717
# I can dream about you...

707
01:17:28,805 --> 01:17:30,603
You know something, Waldo?

708
01:17:30,686 --> 01:17:34,317
- We're gonna be rich.
- Yeah, long live rock'n'roll.

709
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:42,130
# I can dream about you
if I can't hold you tonight

710
01:17:43,854 --> 01:17:50,650
# I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right

711
01:17:52,139 --> 01:17:59,538
# Moving sidewalks
I don't see under my feet

712
01:18:00,864 --> 01:18:04,222
Great, huh? My new discovery.
I'll take them right up the ladder.

713
01:18:04,306 --> 01:18:08,063
Yeah, they oughtta make you
a lot of money, Fish.

714
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:14,901
Don't worry. I won't stand in your way
with Ellen. I know how it is between you.

715
01:18:14,992 --> 01:18:19,193
There's one thing we both know.
She needs you more than she needs me.

716
01:18:19,276 --> 01:18:23,065
- Yeah, she needs me but she loves you.
- She'll get over it.

717
01:18:23,158 --> 01:18:27,631
- She's used to me being unreliable.
- Is that what I'm supposed to tell her?

718
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:32,160
You're OK with words.
You'll make her feel better than I could.

719
01:18:34,446 --> 01:18:37,996
Take it easy, Cody. Thanks.

720
01:18:38,687 --> 01:18:41,487
I'll take it wherever I can get it.

721
01:18:45,132 --> 01:18:53,328
# Climbing up from the pain in my heart
cos it's you that I need

722
01:18:53,416 --> 01:18:55,214
(cheering)

723
01:19:01,021 --> 01:19:02,819
# I can dream

724
01:19:08,705 --> 01:19:10,185
# I can dream

725
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,544
Everybody!

726
01:19:17,031 --> 01:19:18,829
# Yes, I can dream

727
01:19:25,915 --> 01:19:31,709
# I don't understand it
I can't keep my mind off loving you

728
01:19:31,799 --> 01:19:34,109
# Not even for a minute

729
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,792
# Oh, now, baby

730
01:19:35,881 --> 01:19:41,675
# I'm caught up in the magic I see in you
There's one thing to do...

731
01:19:43,687 --> 01:19:46,122
I guess you're just gonna cut out, huh?

732
01:19:46,209 --> 01:19:50,249
- Yeah, you know me.
- Yeah, you're the guy with the right hook.

733
01:19:56,535 --> 01:20:00,006
Is that it? Is that all you have left to say?

734
01:20:01,217 --> 01:20:06,055
Look, I know you're gonna be
goin' places with your singing.

735
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:10,420
I'm not the kind of guy that will carry
any guitars around for you.

736
01:20:10,503 --> 01:20:14,862
But if you ever need me
for something, I'll be there.

737
01:20:18,388 --> 01:20:22,144
# I can dream about you

738
01:20:22,231 --> 01:20:26,589
# I'm gonna press my lips
against you and hold you to me

739
01:20:26,672 --> 01:20:30,269
# I can dream about you

740
01:20:30,354 --> 01:20:34,590
# You know you've got me spellbound
What else can it be?

741
01:20:34,678 --> 01:20:36,475
# I can dream

742
01:20:38,439 --> 01:20:41,159
# Dreaming about you...

743
01:20:44,243 --> 01:20:46,234
(music ends' cheering)

744
01:21:15,382 --> 01:21:18,454
# I've got a dream about an angel
on the beach

745
01:21:18,543 --> 01:21:22,459
# And the perfect waves
are starting to come

746
01:21:23,786 --> 01:21:30,866
# His hair is flying out in ribbons of gold
and his touch has got the power to stun

747
01:21:31,992 --> 01:21:35,508
# I've got a dream
about an angel in the forest

748
01:21:35,594 --> 01:21:38,793
# Enchanted by the edge of a lake

749
01:21:40,277 --> 01:21:47,197
# His body's flowing in the jewels alive
and the earth below is starting to shake

750
01:21:47,962 --> 01:21:55,997
# But I don't see any angels in the city
I don't hear any holy choirs sing

751
01:21:56,085 --> 01:22:03,006
# And if I can't get an angel I can still get
a boy and a boy'd be the next best thing

752
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:06,481
# The next best thing to an angel

753
01:22:06,572 --> 01:22:09,691
# A boy'd be the next best thing

754
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:23,297
# I've got a dream about a boy in a castle
and he's dancing like the cat on the stairs

755
01:22:23,382 --> 01:22:29,655
# He's got the fire of a prince in his eyes
and the thunder of a drum in his ears

756
01:22:29,746 --> 01:22:36,019
# I've got a dream about a boy on a star
lookin' down upon the rim of the world

757
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:38,909
# He's there all alone
and dreamin' of someone like me

758
01:22:38,991 --> 01:22:42,031
# I'm not an angel but at least I'm a girl

759
01:22:43,115 --> 01:22:48,750
# I've got a dream when the darkness is
over, we'll be lyin' in the rays of the sun

760
01:22:48,839 --> 01:22:51,798
# But it's only a dream
and tonight is for real

761
01:22:51,879 --> 01:22:57,560
# You'll never know what it means but
you'll know how it feels, it's gonna be over

762

763
01:23:01,326 --> 01:23:03,522
# It's all we really got tonight

764
01:23:03,608 --> 01:23:09,606
# Stop your cryin', hold on tonight
Before you know it, it's gone tonight

765
01:23:09,691 --> 01:23:15,564
# Tonight is what it means to be young
Tonight is what it means to be young

766
01:23:15,654 --> 01:23:18,170

# Tonight is what it means to be young...

790
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:27,722
Hey, Cody,
how do you like my new wheels?

791
01:25:27,814 --> 01:25:32,526
I found it in the middle of the street.
Somebody dumped it. Finders keepers.

792
01:25:32,617 --> 01:25:37,170
- Maybe you need some company, huh?
- I don't mind if you tag along.

793
01:25:41,503 --> 01:25:44,302
I guess this is my big chance, huh?

794
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:50,659
Cool down, big guy.
I already told you. You're not my type.

795
01:25:51,669 --> 01:25:53,341
# Let the fire be started

796
01:25:53,429 --> 01:25:57,141
# We're dancing for the desperate
and the brokenhearted

797
01:25:57,232 --> 01:25:59,951
# The things they say
and then the things they do

798
01:26:00,032 --> 01:26:03,344
# Nothing's gonna stop us
if our aim is true

799
01:26:03,434 --> 01:26:06,314
# The things they say
and then the things they do

800
01:26:06,397 --> 01:26:09,788
# Nothing's gonna stop us
if our aim is true

801
01:26:09,879 --> 01:26:13,157
# The things they say
and then the things they do

802
01:26:13,242 --> 01:26:16,279
# Nothing's gonna stop us
if our aim is true

803
01:26:16,363 --> 01:26:19,243
# Let the rebels begin
Let the fire be started

804
01:26:19,326 --> 01:26:22,398
# We're dancing for the restless
and the brokenhearted

805
01:26:22,487 --> 01:26:25,639
# Let the rebels begin
Let the fire be started

806
01:26:25,728 --> 01:26:29,041
# We're dancing for the desperate
and the brokenhearted

807
01:26:29,131 --> 01:26:32,123
# Let the rebels begin
Let the fire be started

808
01:26:32,212 --> 01:26:37,209
# We're dancing for the restless
and the brokenhearted...

809
01:27:06,233 --> 01:27:10,274
# Talking about stealing the show
No one would know

810
01:27:10,355 --> 01:27:14,191
# Talking about stealing the show
when they're all letting go

811
01:27:14,277 --> 01:27:18,478
# Take a look at the witch, see the twitch
in her eye, tell me what did she feel

812
01:27:18,562 --> 01:27:23,354
# Is this the way of the world, to take
a boy and a girl, show them lying is real?

813
01:27:23,444 --> 01:27:26,755
# Then I see the edge, I look, I fall

814
01:27:26,846 --> 01:27:31,399
# And I get deeper and deeper

815
01:27:31,488 --> 01:27:35,278
# The more I see, the more I fall, there's
no place to hide, I better take the call

816
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:39,332
# I get deeper and deeper

817
01:27:47,498 --> 01:27:51,539
# Is it the smell of the oil, the sweat
and the toil that makes living unreal?

818
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:55,741
# Was it the man in the suit, the man
with a flute, tell me, what did he steal?

819
01:27:55,823 --> 01:27:59,784
# Is it beginning to break?
Can you see the mistake? Nowhere to go

820
01:27:59,866 --> 01:28:05,023
# Was it a fool and his blood in the wrong
neighbourhood, what price does he pay?

821
01:28:05,109 --> 01:28:08,307
# Then I see the edge, I look, I fall

822
01:28:08,391 --> 01:28:13,228
