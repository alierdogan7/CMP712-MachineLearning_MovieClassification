Look. . . Whatever is being said
about my brother is all lies. . .

462
02:00:18,464 --> 02:00:27,429
my brother is a good man. . .
All he wanted was to help the people. . .

463
02:00:27,473 --> 02:00:36,245
By starting a chain of not saying thank you. . .
but helping 3 people instead. . .

the nice aunty had told me in school. . .

Are you watching T.V.?

Look. . . Whatever is being said
about my brother is all lies. . .

471
02:09:42,461 --> 02:09:47,364
All he wanted was to help the people. . .
By starting a chain of not saying thank you. . .

472
02:09:47,366 --> 02:09:54,272
but helping 3 people in need
and asking them to help 3 other people . . .

473
02:11:01,240 --> 02:11:05,506
And if l am okay. . .
it is only because ofJai Agnihotri. . .

474
02:11:05,510 --> 02:11:07,478
But what about what home minister
Dashrat Singh said about Jai. . .?

475
02:11:07,512 --> 02:11:13,314
Dashrat Singh is a liar. . .
lt is all his fault. . .

476
02:11:17,256 --> 02:11:22,250
Dashrat Singh tried to kill me
and put the blame on Jai. . .

477
02:11:28,500 --> 02:11:31,469
lf there is a terrorist. . .
lts Dasrat Singh. . .

478
02:11:33,438 --> 02:11:36,236
