1
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,367
I got the strangler!

2
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,369
Wabash and Van Buren!

3
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:06,889
Oh, shit.

4
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,535
Oh, shit!

5
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,071
Jack, get the van.

6
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,473
Eddie, help me!

7
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:21,980
Eddie, don't leave me!
God, no!

8
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,866
Give it up, Ray!
It's over!

9
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,449
Oh, God, I'm dying.

10
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,752
You hear this,
you son of a bitch?

11
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,227
I'm gonna get you for it!

12
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,021
I'm gonna get you...

13
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,123
and I'm gonna get Eddie...

14
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,931
no matter what!

15
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,516
I gotta find somebody.

16
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:50,990
I don't know. I gotta find somebody.

17
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,543
Give me the power,
I beg of you!

18
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:24,209
I have no friends.
No one will play with me.

19
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,343
Uh-oh. There's a friend in need.

20
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,115
Hey, cheer up.

21
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,817
- Who are you?
- I'm a Good Guy.

22
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,257
I've just come
from the Good Guy clubhouse...

23
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,262
and I'll be your friend
to the end.

24
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:41,823
You will?
You mean you'll be my friend now?

25
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,835
Sure, I will.

26
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,837
Hidey-ho.

27
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,374
I saw this one.

28
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,855
All right, Good Guys,
that's our ''Good Guy Show'' for today...

29
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,227
but don't go away...

30
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,393
because we've got a very important
Good Guy message...

31
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,903
just for you.

32
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:25,437
Hi, Good Guys.
Boy, have I got news for you.

33
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:28,912
Now you can have your very own
Good Guy doll.

34
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,381
That's right.
You can have all the adventures...

35
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,476
we have on TV
in your very own home.

36
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,882
Good Guys say
three different sentences.

37
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,721
We even turn our heads
and blink our eyes when you talk to us.

38
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,056
Right, Oscar?

39
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,758
Hi, I'm Oscar,
and I'm your friend to the end.

40
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,458
Hidey-ho!

41
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,866
Wow!

42
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,906
Every Good Guy has a name
all his own...

43
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:58,067
so he can be
your very own best friend.

44
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:02,045
So remember to tell Mom and Dad
you want a Good Guy.

45
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:06,107
Perfect for birthdays
or just any old time.

46
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,449
And remember, you can buy...

47
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,849
all our Good Guy accessories too.

48
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,324
- Right, Oscar?
- Right.

49
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,496
Brought to you exclusively
by Play Pals...

50
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,493
makers of Good Guys
and other fine toys.

51
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:24,395
Found in toy stores
throughout the greater Chicago area.

52
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,908
Mommy, wake up!

53
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,001
- What time is it, Andy?
- Wake up.

54
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,229
It's only 6:30 in the morning.

55
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:06,369
But it's a beautiful day outside.
See?

56
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,414
It certainly is.
How long you been up, birthday boy?

57
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,917
Since forever.

58
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,046
I made you breakfast in bed.

59
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,750
You did? Oh, God.

60
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,089
Well, thanks.

61
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:25,096
Well, this looks just excellent.

62
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,765
I'll tell you what.

63
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,429
Why don't I eat this
just a little later, okay?

64
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,299
But first I gotta give you
your super-duper birthday tummy-gummy.

65
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,879
Come here. Come here.

66
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,916
That's one. How many years
old are you today? Two.

67
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,180
Happy birthday, pumpkin.

68
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:53,156
Thanks. Can we open
my presents now, Mommy?

69
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,251
- Yes, we can.
- Terrific!

70
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,493
Good morning, Chicago.
Leading off at this hour...

71
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,228
Charles Lee Ray,
the notorious Lake Shore Strangler...

72
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:07,534
was shot and killed shortly before 3:00
a.m. this morning on Wabash Avenue.

73
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,935
Can I open this first, Mommy?

74
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,944
Andy, don't you want to start
with the smaller one first?

75
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,748
Okay, go ahead.

76
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,316
Well, what do you think?
You need these clothes so badly.

77
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:31,260
I think they're gonna be okay.
We'll just take them up a couple inches.

78
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,331
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

79
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,329
I know.
You want some toys, don't you?

80
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,339
Not boring old clothes.

81
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,570
Try the other one.

82
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,007
What do you think?

83
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,382
I want a Good Guy to go with it.

84
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,547
I know you do, Andy,
but I didn't know about it...

85
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,882
in time this month
to save up for it.

86
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,198
- Karen.
- Hi.

87
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:13,931
You know that doll you wanted
for Andy? It cost 100 bucks.

88
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,271
There was a peddler in the alley behind
the store and I think he's got one.

89
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:21,244
- Why would a peddler have a doll?
- Grab your purse. We can get a deal.

90
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,872
- I can't leave.
- Do you want it or not?

91
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:27,111
- Of course.
- Then come on.

92
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,256
There he is.

93
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,095
Okay, show her.

94
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,464
Well, is it a Good Guy or not?

95
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,263
It is.

96
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,999
- Well, I told you.
- How much do you want?

97
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,337
- Fifty bucks.
- Ten and not a penny more.

98
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,775
- Thirty.
- That thing is not worth thirty.

99
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,278
Take it or leave it.
Somebody else will buy it.

100
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,406
- Take it.
- It's too much money.

101
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,007
No, it isn't. You have no idea
how much Andy wants this doll.

102
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,747
- But we don't know if it works.
- Here you go, lady.

103
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:05,380
- May it bring you and your kid joy.
- Thank you.

104
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,254
Hold on, you!

105
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,089
How do we know the damn thing
isn't stolen?

106
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,222
- Steal this!
- Steal this yourself.

107
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,130
- Maggie.
- I think I dated him.

108
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,228
Come on. We gotta get back to work.

109
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,209
Andy's going to love it!

110
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:28,075
Nice of you to drop by.
Have a nice break?

111
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,978
- Sorry. I was only gone for a minute.
- Have a heart, Criswell.

112
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,517
We were downstairs buying her little boy
a birthday present.

113
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,846
We have specified break times
for activities like that.

114
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:40,892
Mrs. Howe is sick and we're shorthanded
tonight. You have to fill in.

115
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,553
I can't. I have to pick up my son
at the day care.

116
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,354
- This is an emergency.
- I'll take over for her.

117
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:50,367
Miss Peterson, you work in shoes,
not in jewelry.

118
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:55,100
You'll have to do it. You can take off
at 5:00 but be back at 7:00.

119
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,004
It's my son's birthday.

120
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,475
Are you happy with your job?

121
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:00,977
Yes, I am.

122
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,945
Then I suggest--

123
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,881
Chill out, would you, Walter?

124
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,818
- I'll take care of Andy.
- You can't do it again.

125
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,890
Don't be silly. It'll be
the hottest date I've had in months.

126
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,050
I can't imagine why.

127
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,761
- Where are you going?
- ''Good Guys'' are on TV.

128
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,033
I may have something
better for you.

129
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,507
What?

130
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,345
This isn't groceries.

131
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,057
A Good Guy! I knew it!

132
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,131
I knew you'd get me one!

133
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,824
Show me how he works.

134
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:59,163
Hi, I'm Andy.
What's your name?

135
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,839
Hi, I'm Chucky,
and I'm your friend to the end.

136
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,877
Hidey-ho.

137
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,148
Wow! He's something, isn't he?

138
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,240
Oh, Mom, thanks.

139
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,047
You're welcome, honey.

140
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:39,536
- See, that's how you build things.
- WDOL with a late-breaking report.

141
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,804
Eddie Caputo,
accomplice of Charles Lee Ray...

142
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,883
has just escaped
the Michigan Avenue Precinct.

143
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:48,317
More details to follow
on the news at 9:00 next.

144
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,327
Hey, Chucky,
you're not watching me.

145
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,865
Hey, want to play?

146
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,797
Time for bed, Andy.

147
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,864
Come on, Chucky. We have to
get ready to go to bed.

148
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,149
Aunt Maggie,
Chucky wants to watch...

149
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,416
the 9:00 news.

150
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,150
Sure he does.

151
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,985
Okay, kid, off we go.

152
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,291
Come on. There we go.

153
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,331
- Chucky.
- Oh, yes, Chucky.

154
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,099
You too. Off we go.

155
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:49,243
Now it's brush your teeth
and under the covers with you.

156
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,143
Okay? Agreed?

157
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,117
Good.

158
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,451
You yell when you're ready
for me to tuck you in.

159
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,088
Hey, Chucky,
want to see my room?

160
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,869
Andy, are you
brushing your teeth?

161
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,415
Yes, Aunt Maggie!

162
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,780
Good.

163
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,883
And now, Action News at 9:00.

164
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,327
In Washington today,
the mayor replied...

165
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,868
that he would study
the congressional findings carefully...

166
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:47,996
and have the commission on gang-related
violence issue recommendations to him.

167
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,098
Back to you, Steve.

168
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,109
Thank you, Terry.

169
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,907
Police have now clarified
the information...

170
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,914
regarding the escape
of Eddie Caputo.

171
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,075
Caputo eluded his captors...

172
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,415
while being transferred onto
a prison bus on his way to court.

173
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,965
Okay, mister, what do you
have to say about this?

174
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,967
- About what?
- Come on.

175
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:22,907
You know, you have to learn
that when I say something, I mean it.

176
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:26,409
- But what did I do?
- You know what I'm talking about.

177
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,037
Turning the TV on
and putting Chucky in front of it...

178
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,514
when I told you
it was time to go to bed.

179
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,184
- I didn't do that.
- No? What did Chucky do?

180
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,084
Walk into the living room
and turn it on by himself?

181
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,248
Did you do that, Chucky?

182
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,986
Andy, stop it!
Under the covers! Hurry.

183
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,498
- But Aunt--
- Under the covers and not another word.

184
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:51,099
But I didn't put Chucky
in front of the TV.

185
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:54,366
Shh. Enough. Okay?

186
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,031
Give me a kiss.

187
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:59,167
Good night, baby,
and happy birthday.

188
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,212
Good night, Aunt Maggie.

189
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:22,400
I told you she'd be mad at you
if you watched the news.

190
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,348
Andy, is that you?

191
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,975
How did that happen?

192
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,140
Hello?

193
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,242
Hi. How's it going?
How's Andy?

194
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:04,811
- Karen?
- Who else? Is something wrong?

195
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,292
No.

196
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:12,359
Everything's fine.

197
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,058
You don't sound
like everything's fine.

198
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:19,831
I just had a bit of
the alone-at-night willies.

199
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,499
Now, would you
stop worrying and...

200
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,407
give Criswell
a kick in the pants for me.

201
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,370
You got it.

202
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,245
Listen. Thank you for everything.
You're a real pal.

203
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,511
Oh, yeah?

204
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:38,415
Yeah. Give Andy a kiss for me.
See you soon. Bye.

205
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:18,986
What is wrong with me?

206
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,497
I'm scaring myself
half to death.

207
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,427
Get away from this barricade.

208
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,501
Move it back.
There's nothing to see.

209
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:01,004
Let's move this police line back.
Go on home, folks, please.

210
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,718
She was on the sixth floor.

211
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,030
Whoa, miss!
What are you doing?

212
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,861
I live here.

213
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,780
Mommy!

214
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,512
Oh, thank God.

215
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,380
Are you all right?

216
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,050
I'm so glad.
I got so scared when--

217
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,753
What's wrong? Where's Maggie?

218
00:24:56,862 --> 00:25:00,798
- She had an accident.
- What kind of an accident?

219
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,925
Mrs. Barclay,
I'm Detective Mike Norris, homicide.

220
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,128
Could I talk to you
out in the hall?

221
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:09,002
- Why? What's happened to Maggie?
- Please.

222
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:13,310
I'll be right back.

223
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,049
Look, Mrs. Barclay--

224
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,057
What?

225
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:35,132
- Miss Peterson's dead, Mrs. Barclay.
- What?

226
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:41,869
- How?
- She fell from your kitchen window.

227
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,032
- No!
- Whoa.

228
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,002
You all right?

229
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,376
Yes.

230
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,074
Come on.

231
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,463
Do you got any idea
what these are?

232
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,508
No.

233
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,745
They look like footprints,
don't they? Very small footprints.

234
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,941
- What are you implying?
- I don't know.

235
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,519
What would Andy be doing
up on the counter, right?

236
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:32,883
I already checked his closet.
None of his shoes matched these prints.

237
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,390
Mommy?

238
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:38,929
Chucky wanted to know
what was going on.

239
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,464
I want you to go to bed.
We are very busy.

240
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:44,798
- But Mom--
- Right now, please.

241
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:49,735
What's on your feet?

242
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:53,174
Good Guy pj sneakers.

243
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,213
Wow. Come here.

244
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,741
- Can I see the bottoms of them?
- Sure.

245
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:05,380
Look at this. There's a gun.
Is that a cowboy hat?

246
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,891
Andy, get into bed.
I'll be in to tuck you in.

247
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,394
- But Mom--
- Right now!

248
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:18,129
Why are you treating Andy
like this?

249
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:21,865
If he says he doesn't know how those
footprints got there, then he doesn't.

250
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,965
Look, somebody made those footprints.
If not Andy, then who?

251
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:27,044
I don't know
and I don't care.

252
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,910
I've just lost my best friend
to a horrible accident...

253
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:34,042
and I would like some time alone with
my son who I'm sure is just as upset.

254
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,314
I'm sorry.

255
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:39,515
I'll clear everybody out of here
right away.

256
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:42,453
Hey, guys, you done?
Let's go.

257
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,051
Let's go, everybody.
Out of here!

258
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,997
What do you think
was so important...

259
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,737
about my sneakers, Chucky?

260
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:03,177
You don't know either, do you?

261
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:24,931
Let me know if you find anything out
about those footprints.

262
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:31,037
I know who was
on the kitchen counter.

263
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:34,373
- Who, Andy?
- Chucky!

264
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,969
Your doll?

265
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:41,448
That's enough stories for tonight.
Back to bed. I mean it!

266
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,292
Good night, detective.

267
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,364
- What?
- Are you going to call me?

268
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:58,334
- You don't give up, do you?
- I just-- I hate loose ends.

269
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,871
And I hate people
who don't know when stop.

270
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:05,836
- Ouch. A spirited lady.
- No kidding.

271
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:09,038
I want that autopsy report
first thing tomorrow...

272
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,877
and anything you can find out
about the Barclays.

273
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,679
You got it! Anything else?

274
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,280
Yeah. Here.
Get this to the lab.

275
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,289
I found it in the corner
of the kitchen.

276
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:23,019
- What is this?
- Possible murder weapon.

277
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:28,226
Come on. You're kidding me.

278
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,063
Hey, you are kidding me,
aren't you?

279
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,129
Who are you talking to?

280
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,292
Chucky.

281
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:15,743
Chucky, huh?

282
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:18,213
Yeah, sure, Chucky.

283
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,876
He's sitting right over there.

284
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:27,023
Chucky's been talking to you too,
hasn't he?

285
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,151
- What's he been saying?
- All kinds of things.

286
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:34,220
His real name
is Charles Lee Ray...

287
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:38,132
and he's been sent down
from heaven by Daddy...

288
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,397
to play with me.

289
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:47,473
He has, has he?
Anything else?

290
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:51,208
Yes. He said Aunt Maggie
was a real bitch...

291
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:54,012
and got what she deserved.

292
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:58,020
Andy, how can you say
something so horrible?

293
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,113
I didn't say it. Chucky did.

294
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:05,060
Andy, stop it. You know perfectly well
that you're making this up!

295
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:08,894
But I'm not. Chucky's alive.
Really, he is.

296
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,434
Chucky-- Chucky's a doll.

297
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,936
He's made of plastic
and stuffing.

298
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,201
Look at him.
Does he look like anything else?

299
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:19,276
Don't, you'll hurt him.

300
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,368
Andy, look!

301
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:24,539
You don't really think
that Chucky is alive, do you?

302
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,113
But he is.

303
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,345
Andy, stop it! Please!

304
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:35,019
It's 'cause of Aunt Maggie
you're yelling at me, isn't it?

305
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:41,361
Yes. Yes, I guess it is.

306
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,457
I'm sorry.

307
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,799
I'll stop making up stories.

308
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,476
Thanks, champ.

309
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,006
Do you want to sleep
in with me tonight?

310
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,878
No, it's all right.

311
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:02,111
I've got Chucky.

312
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,156
Come on, into bed.

313
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,163
Good night, sweetheart.

314
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,794
I love you.

315
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:25,169
Bye-bye.

316
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:38,521
You're right, Chucky.
She didn't believe me.

317
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:47,527
Hi. I like to be hugged.

318
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:52,501
Good. I'd love to hug you too.

319
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:09,386
You sure you're all right
about last night?

320
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,115
No bad dreams
about Aunt Maggie?

321
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:16,454
And Chucky's only a doll, right?

322
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,990
Off to school then.
I love you tons.

323
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:39,338
43rd street.
Next stop, 47th.

324
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:33,296
Is that Eddie's?

325
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:41,729
Look, you stay here.
I have to go tinkle.

326
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,444
I'll be right there, Chucky!

327
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:08,072
- Mrs. Barclay?
- I came as soon as I got your message.

328
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,773
You haven't picked up your son
from school?

329
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:15,079
- I came directly from work. Why?
- Let's go into my office.

330
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,178
- Is something wrong with Andy?
- Please.

331
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:29,093
- I don't know how to tell you this.
- Tell me what?

332
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:32,966
Do you have any idea why your
Aunt Maggie fell out of that window?

333
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,506
- Yes.
- Could you tell me why?

334
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:41,438
'Cause she saw Chucky and
it scared her so much, she fell out.

335
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,807
She did, huh?

336
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:46,713
So why did Chucky
go to see Eddie Caputo?

337
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,342
Mommy!

338
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,953
All right, sweetheart.
Come on.

339
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,163
Now listen to me, okay?

340
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:04,959
Nobody believes you about Chucky.

341
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:09,165
Unless you start telling the truth
right now...

342
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,800
they're going to
take you away from me.

343
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,172
You hear that, Chucky?

344
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,307
They're taking me away
unless you say something.

345
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:25,518
Please, say something.

346
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,281
Come on, Chucky!
Say something!

347
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:32,158
Tell me why you lied to me
about everything.

348
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:35,392
Come on, Chucky!
Say something!

349
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:37,160
Tell me!

350
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,568
Hi! I'm Chucky and
I'm your friend to the end. Hidey-ho.

351
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:47,139
Mommy, he's doing it on purpose!

352
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:51,908
He told me never to tell about him
or he'd kill me.

353
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:55,782
Mrs. Barclay, my name is Dr. Ardmore.
I'm from County General.

354
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:57,946
I've seen more than enough.

355
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:01,183
Maybe Andy should spend
a couple of days with us.

356
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:42,794
Well, say something,
you little bastard.

357
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,766
Say something, damn it!

358
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,365
Hi. I like to be hugged.

359
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,843
"He wants you
for a best friend."

360
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,510
Yeah, sure.

361
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,910
Hi. I'm Chucky!
Want to play?

362
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,873
Talk to me.

363
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:45,981
Come on, talk!

364
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:50,980
I said talk to me, damn it!
All right!

365
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,454
Then I'm going to make you talk!

366
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:08,335
Talk to me,
or I'll throw you in the fire!

367
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:11,738
You stupid bitch!
You filthy slut!

368
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,037
I'll teach you
to fuck with me!

369
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,418
Stop!

370
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:50,206
Detective Norris!

371
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:52,902
- What are you doing back here?
- Andy was telling the truth.

372
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:57,071
- Chucky is alive and killed Caputo.
- What?

373
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:01,481
I was about to throw away the box
he came in when the batteries fell out.

374
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:05,381
Don't you see? He's been moving
and talking without any batteries.

375
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:09,289
- What are you talking about?
- How I found out the doll is alive.

376
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,827
I threatened
to throw him into the fireplace...

377
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:14,397
when all of a sudden,
he came alive.

378
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,864
I dropped him, and he ran out
of the apartment.

379
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:20,302
Good night, Mrs. Barclay.

380
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:23,134
Wait a minute!
I am telling you the truth!

381
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:28,702
- He killed Maggie and Caputo.
- Look, I sympathize with you.

382
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:31,872
I hated what happened in there today,
but lying is--

383
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:35,509
Lying? Does this look
like I'm lying?

384
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:38,186
- How did you get those?
- Chucky bit me.

385
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:41,280
Oh, for God's sake!

386
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:43,291
All right, don't believe me!

387
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,761
- Where you goin'?
- To find Chucky!

388
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,832
How you gonna do that?

389
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:51,298
I'll start with the peddler
I bought him from.

390
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:55,828
That isn't a good part of town!
You hear me?

391
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:58,875
You don't want to go down there
at this time of night.

392
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,372
Goddamn it!

393
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,090
What's she doin' here?

394
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,029
Hey, excuse me.

395
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,463
Mister!

396
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:37,169
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Do you remember me?

397
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,006
I bought a doll from you in back of
Carson's department store yesterday.

398
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,204
- Doll?
- A Good Guy doll.

399
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:46,749
- You sold it to me. Do you remember?
- What about it?

400
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:49,910
- Where did you get it?
- What will you give me if I tell you?

401
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:54,389
I don't have much.
You're welcome to whatever I have.

402
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:01,289
It's not enough.
What else you got?

403
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:04,231
- That's all I've got.
- All you got?

404
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:07,098
- What are you-- Yes.
- That's not all you got.

405
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,934
- Wait a minute.
- No, you got a lot.

406
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:14,969
- Wait! No!
- Pig!

407
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:19,378
- He's a cop!
- What about the rest of you?

408
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,951
You wanna party too?

409
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:32,223
You want to answer the lady now?
Where did you get that doll?

410
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:34,229
I don't know nothin'
about no doll.

411
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:37,095
You won't know nothin'
about nothin'! Now talk!

412
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,101
A burned-out toy store on Wabash!
That's where I got it.

413
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:45,073
Get outta here!

414
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,443
What's wrong?

415
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,843
Nothing.

416
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:55,340
Wait. Something the peddler said
upset you. What was it?

417
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:57,545
I just told you-- nothing.

418
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:01,086
Goddamn it! My son's life
is at stake! What was it?

419
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:06,488
The place where he said he got the doll,
Charles Lee Ray died there.

420
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:08,230
Who?

421
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:12,199
The Lake Shore Strangler.
He's partners with Eddie Caputo.

422
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:15,897
- Where are you going?
- Wabash and Van Buren.

423
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:19,237
It's an abandoned wreck of a store.
Why don't you believe me?

424
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:22,778
It was struck by lightning
the night Charles Lee Ray died.

425
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:29,115
- How do you know that?
- Because I was there! I killed him!

426
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:38,450
Why didn't you tell me?

427
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:41,998
It's not exactly the kind of thing
you tell someone.

428
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:45,432
Let me take you home.
You need some sleep.

429
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,095
- Did he say anything?
- Who?

430
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:52,301
- Charles Lee Ray.
- He threatened to kill me and Caputo.

431
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,280
Sorry you couldn't find anything
to help Andy.

432
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:10,018
I really am.

433
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:14,029
But I did. I found out
that Chucky is Charles Lee Ray.

434
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:18,329
The only thing I don't know
is how he got inside the doll.

435
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:21,302
- Good night.
- Where did Charles Lee Ray live?

436
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:25,033
Look, please, will you
just get out of the car?

437
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,803
Just tell me.

438
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,310
Don't you understand?
Andy's life depends on it.

439
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,911
730 Stoney Island,
the south side.

440
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:36,851
I've already checked.
There's nothing there. Good night.

441
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:38,284
Where are you going?

442
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:41,924
- Home. Get some sleep.
- You can't do that!

443
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:44,459
Don't you see?
You just said it.

444
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:46,893
Chucky killed Caputo.
That leaves you.

445
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,488
- That does it.
- Please listen to me.

446
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:56,368
- Out.
- I am telling you the truth!

447
00:52:56,439 --> 00:53:00,500
- Why won't you believe me?
- Because I'm sane and rational.

448
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:04,714
All right!

449
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:06,975
Do you remember what you said
the first night you met me?

450
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,983
- What?
- You didn't like loose ends.

451
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:12,885
I'm a loose end. You can't let go what I
said tonight without checking it out.

452
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:14,890
For the last time,
good night.

453
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,347
Good night, asshole.

454
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,793
Oh, God!

455
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,469
Look out!

456
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,970
Won't do ya any good!
You can't hurt me!

457
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:48,048
What are you doing here?

458
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:51,025
After I talked to you last night...

459
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:54,460
I decided to go back to the station
and pull Ray's file.

460
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:58,228
I learned a couple of things.
His nickname was Chucky.

461
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:01,836
He spent a lot of time
with this man.

462
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:12,279
All we have to do is find him
before Chucky does.

463
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,419
Over here!

464
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,230
It's me. Chucky.

465
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:33,928
What d'ya think?
The grigri work?

466
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:40,066
You know, when I came here
learning about how to beat death...

467
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:42,804
I thought maybe you were
pullin' my chain.

468
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,812
But not now.

469
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:48,816
- Only one problem.
- What?

470
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:53,083
This. I didn't think
anybody could hurt me.

471
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:54,919
But last night I got shot.

472
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,083
Know somethin'?
It hurt.

473
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:01,460
It hurt like a son of a bitch.
It even bled.

474
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:02,759
Why's that?

475
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,128
- You're turning human?
- What?

476
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:11,137
The more time you spend
in that body...

477
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,140
the more human you become.

478
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:17,410
You mean I have to live
the rest of my life in this body?

479
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:22,112
No fucking way! You got me
into this, you get me out!

480
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:26,419
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

481
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:30,881
Because you're an abomination!

482
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:33,758
An outrage against nature!

483
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:36,331
You've perverted everything
I've taught you...

484
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:38,195
and used it for evil!

485
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:40,201
You have to be stopped!

486
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:46,940
You know, I thought
something like this might happen.

487
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:50,035
- That's why I prepared for it.
- What are you talking about?

488
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,541
Your own personal mojo.

489
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,241
- Give me that.
- Sure. How do you want it?

490
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:58,149
Broken leg?

491
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:05,156
Shouldn't tell your customers
where you hide things like this.

492
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:07,252
Gets you in trouble every time.

493
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:10,230
How do I get out of this body?

494
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,097
- No. I won't tell you.
- Yeah?

495
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:19,508
Tell me or die.
Your choice.

496
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:22,343
I'll tell you.

497
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:27,480
You have to transfer your soul
out of the doll...

498
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:31,849
into that of the first human being you
revealed your true self to.

499
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:35,446
You mean the first person I let in on
the fact that I was really alive?

500
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,861
I just don't believe it.

501
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:46,025
The first person I told my secret
was a six-year-old kid.

502
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:48,160
I'm gonna be six years old again.

503
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:52,867
Well, it's been fun,
but I gotta go.

504
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:55,934
I have a date
with a six-year-old boy.

505
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,015
And you have a date
with death.

506
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:05,177
So long.

507
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:32,246
Hold it! Wait!

508
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:41,823
Oh, my God.

509
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:47,352
- Too late.
- What?

510
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:49,829
Must save the boy. Must--

511
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:54,993
Must get his souI...

512
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:58,801
into him like he got into doll.

513
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:00,341
What?

514
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:04,174
You must stop him
before he can say the chant.

515
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:07,512
Kill him before he can say it.

516
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,513
But how?

517
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:14,846
The heart.
His heart is almost human.

518
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:20,455
It's the only way.
Through the heart.

519
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:42,081
Help me!
Dr. Ardmore, Chucky's here!

520
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:54,885
Help me! He's coming to kill me!

521
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,760
He's here! Chucky's here!

522
01:03:56,866 --> 01:03:59,902
I don't see anybody.

523
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:02,063
But Chucky's here.

524
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:04,332
And he's going to kill me.

525
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:12,479
But Chucky is here,
and he's going to kill me!

526
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:18,009
He's going to kill me.

527
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,248
Please don't leave me. Please.

528
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:19,881
Stop!

529
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:22,049
Stop him!

530
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,263
Check the north corridor!

531
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:25,411
Easy, Andy, easy.
It's all right.

532
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:28,847
You're not gonna need this anymore.

533
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:33,012
But I do! Chucky's in the room,
and he's trying to kill me!

534
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:35,090
No. It's gonna be all right.

535
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:36,988
I'm gonna protect you.

536
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:40,327
Easy, boy, easy.

537
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:42,124
Nobody's here.

538
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:44,529
No, please! He'll kill you too.

539
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:48,258
No. Please listen to me. Please!

540
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:51,101
This is just gonna sting you
for one second.

541
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:08,383
Stop! Stop!

542
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:35,007
What happened?

543
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:37,711
Miss, could you just excuse us
for a minute?

544
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,287
What?

545
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:42,855
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

546
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:46,121
Fried him to a crisp with the electric
shock machine, and then he escaped.

547
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,889
Escaped? Where?

548
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:51,125
We don't know,
but I bet she does.

549
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,372
You seen Chucky anywhere?

550
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:01,399
- Who's Chucky?
- Kid's doll.

551
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:04,673
The same one that was at the station.
Have you seen him?

552
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:07,340
What am I gonna know about a doll?
Where are you goin'?

553
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:12,217
They think Andy did it.

554
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:15,757
The girl said Chucky was here
looking for Andy.

555
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:17,758
- Where would Andy go?
- Home.

556
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:20,260
- I said go there if he was in trouble.
- Does he have a key?

557
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:22,762
- It's under the mat.
- Come on. We don't have much time.

558
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:49,950
Look, George.

559
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:52,527
- Some child left their doll.
- Leave it alone.

560
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:55,457
Whoever left it there
will come back looking for it.

561
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:03,137
Ugly doll.

562
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,100
Fuck you.

563
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,307
Surprise!

564
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:24,206
Batter up!

565
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:11,956
Give me the power,
I beg of you.

566
01:12:37,953 --> 01:12:39,545
Can you hear me?

567
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:01,468
Karen, are you all right?

568
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:09,050
Just take care of Andy.

569
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:17,054
Take this. Take it.

570
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:20,920
Mommy.

571
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:22,991
What's wrong? Gun jammed?

572
01:15:02,297 --> 01:15:05,095
Andy, help me!
The matches!

573
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:08,400
Please! Now!

574
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:23,212
Andy, no, please.

575
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:26,151
We're friends to the end.
Remember?

576
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:29,952
This is the end, friend.

577
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,170
Oh, my baby.

578
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:19,873
You all right?

579
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:30,444
Go get me the first-aid kit
under the kitchen sink really fast.

580
01:16:30,552 --> 01:16:34,283
- What happened?
- Oh, God. Chucky's dead.

581
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:49,794
Mommy, Chucky's gone.

582
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:52,540
Andy, hurry up.

583
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:10,891
Hello, Andy.

584
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:14,926
Mommy.

585
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:25,906
Give me the boy
and I'll let you live!

586
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:28,806
Do you hear me?
Give me the boy!

587
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:28,697
Give me the boy!

588
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:38,972
What the hell's goin' on here?

589
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:46,840
God!

590
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:51,385
Oh, Jesus.

591
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:57,218
I got a cop down--
multiple stab wounds.

592
01:19:57,325 --> 01:20:00,726
Brewster Apartments
on north Grand Street. Make it fast.

593
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:03,127
They're gonna be here in ten minutes.
What happened?

594
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:06,326
The kid was right.
The doll's alive.

595
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:09,062
- He almost got the three of us.
- What?

596
01:20:10,872 --> 01:20:14,774
You don't believe me? Go on.
Check it out in the hall.

597
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:18,539
He's scattered all over the hall.
But don't touch it. Understand?

598
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:21,874
- Don't you touch one part of it!
- All right. Take it easy.

599
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:23,746
Just relax, all right?

600
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:07,892
I'd like you to take a look, because
there's no way this thing's alive.

601
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:12,733
- I told you not to touch it.
- Be sensible.

602
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:15,064
Look. It's as dead as they come.

603
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,136
Choke him! Kill him!

604
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:36,187
Kill him now! Strangle him!
Don't let go!

605
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,087
God.

606
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:54,770
Kill them! Kill them all!

607
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:56,935
The heart!
Shoot him in the heart!

608
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:24,837
Hi. I'm Chucky.

609
01:22:24,906 --> 01:22:27,238
Wanna play--

610
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:41,980
- You believe me now?
- Yeah.

611
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:46,827
But who's gonna believe me?

612
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:52,025
Come on.

613
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:57,098
All right. Ready?
Here we go.

614
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:21,962
Come on. We're gonna
go to the hospital with Mike.

615
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:23,530
Let's go.
