184
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:12,937
I think in the end, it was
jealousy that undid us.

185
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,038
Jealousy?

186
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,760
Yeah, she was getting
more pussy than I was.

187
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,509
Is that true?

188
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:21,145
(LAUGHS) I think so.
Probably, yeah.

189
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,583
So, is this place secure?

190
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,951
Who knows?

191
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,287
I don't speak in arraignable
phrases anywhere.

192
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:32,090
There's a scrambler on
the phone, but still,

193
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,559
there's a lot of
smart people out there.

194
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:39,097
Of course, anybody who
thinks he's the smartest

195
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,065
is on his way to the slam.

196
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,066
Would that be me?

197
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,434
No, no.

198
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:46,070
Although, I have to
say that I always thought

199
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,406
a law degree was
a license to steal

200
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:51,609
and that you, for one, hadn't
really capitalized on it.

201
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,612
You're not the straight dude
people think though, are you?

202
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,080
I guess not.

203
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,983
I don't mean the caper, I mean you.
Women like you.

204
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,184
All right.

205
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,021
Do you know what
they like about you?

206
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,055
I'm a good fuck?

207
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,990
Right!

208
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:09,427
No, they can sniff out
the moral dilemma.

209
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,195
The paradox.

210
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,630
"Moral dilemma."

211
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,133
Yeah, they're drawn to it.
Not sure why.

212
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:18,202
Maybe it's just that lacking
any moral sense themselves,

213
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,738
they're
fascinated by it in men.

214
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,207
Men are attracted to flawed
women, too, of course,

215
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,309
but their illusion
is that they can fix them.

216
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,011
Women don't want
to fix anything.

217
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:29,013
They only want
to be entertained.

218
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,615
The truth about
women is you can

219
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,383
do anything to
them except bore them.

220
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,286
Well

221
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:38,122
there's nothing about Laura
that I would want to fix.

222
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,457
Maybe not.

223
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,025
Do you think she
knows things about me

224
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,727
that I don't know about myself?

225
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:46,130
Jesus, Counselor, I'm not even sure
what sort of question that is.

226
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,066
Yeah.

227
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,103
Okay.

228
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,746
If you pursue this road
that you've embarked upon,

229
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,583
you will eventually
come to moral decisions

230
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,252
that will take you
completely by surprise.

231
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,787
You won't see it coming at all.

232
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,125
I don't intend
to take this up as a trade.

233
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:16,527
Yeah, one-time deal, right?

234
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,096
Which you've heard
a thousand times.

235
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,531
No, but a few.

236
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:24,068
What usually happens is that
after a couple of deals,

237
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:27,371
they know more than you do and they
set up shop across the street.

238
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:28,739
And how does that
work out for them?

239
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,708
Not well.

240
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,477
So,
that would be a moral issue.

241
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,245
Not for me.

242
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,180
Or for your associates.

243
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,517
Yeah, well...

244
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,487
They have a real aversion to
mixing business with pleasure.

245
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,158
Do you know what a bolito is?

246
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,327
No.

247
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,096
A bolo is one of those
skinny neckties

248
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:54,799
or one of those things
you throw in Argentina.

249
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,667
Yeah, right.

250
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:01,372
No. In this case,
it's a mechanical device

251
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,774
and it has this
small electric motor

252
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,576
with this rather
incredible compound

253
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,445
gear that
retrieves a steel cable.

254
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:08,613
Battery-driven.

255
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:11,315
And the cable is made out
of some unholy alloy,

256
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,817
almost impossible to cut it.

257
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,119
And it's in a loop.

258
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:19,290
And you come up behind the guy
and you drop it over his head

259
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,826
and you pull the free end of
the cable tight and walk away.

260
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,394
No one ever even sees you.

261
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,196
And pulling
the cable activates the motor

262
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,265
and the noose starts to tighten

263
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:30,568
and it continues to tighten
until it goes to zero.

264
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,103
It cuts the guy's head off.

265
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,172
Yeah, well, it can.

266
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,406
There's nothing he can do.

267
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,175
No.

268
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,843
Jesus.

269
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:41,946
Yeah.

270
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,482
How long does it take?

271
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,717
Oh...

272
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,452
Three,
four minutes, five maybe.

273
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,321
It depends on your collar size.

274
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,223
You're shitting me.

275
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,391
No, no, no.

276
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:55,626
It's just that
there's no easy way

277
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:58,129
to turn the thing off,
or reason to.

278
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:01,432
It just keeps running until the
noose closes completely and then...

279
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,767
It self-destructs.

280
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:06,270
Actually, you're probably dead
in less than a minute.

281
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,872
From strangulation?

282
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,240
No.

283
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:14,178
The wire cuts through
the carotid arteries

284
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,614
and then sprays blood
all over the spectators

285
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,216
and everybody goes home.

286
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,284
Sweet.

287
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:23,221
Yeah, sweet.

288
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,656
Think about it, Counselor.

289
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,525
(URINATING)

290
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,660
(YELLING IN SPANISH)

291
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,369
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

292
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,494
Here you go, ma'am.

293
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,498
Thank you.

294
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,302
Enjoy your meal.
Thank you.

295
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,271
(PURRING)

296
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:23,314
I have something to
discuss with you

297
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,516
and I'm a bit scared.

298
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,451
Hmm.

299
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,388
Have you been bad?

300
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,056
No.

301
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,030
Actually, I don't have that
much to discuss, so...

302
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,537
Let me just give you this

303
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,907
and tell me what you think.

304
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:05,923
Will you?

305
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:10,461
(LAUGHS)

306
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,800
Don't leave me hanging, here.

307
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,003
Yes, I will!

308
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:33,617
Try it.

309
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,998
What, you didn't know?

310
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,669
I knew

311
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:53,971
but I was scared anyway.

312
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,074
That's good.

313
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,845
It's so beautiful.

314
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,082
You are a glory.

315
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,019
I'm a glory?

316
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,489
Yes.

317
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:14,859
As in "glorious."
You're a glorious woman.

318
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:20,064
And you're a man
of impeccable taste.

319
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,167
Sorry,
I shouldn't have said that.

320
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,437
You can't take it back.

321
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,072
Here.

322
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,478
I intend to love
you until I die.

323
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,348
Me first.

324
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,016
Not on your life.

325
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,505
That's a nice ring.
How many carats is it?

326
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:02,706
I don't know.

327
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,575
You don't know?

328
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:05,676
No.

329
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,411
You've gotta be kidding me.

330
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,479
No, I don't know.

331
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:10,047
Let me see it.

332
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,583
No, take it off.

333
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,157
Mmm.

334
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,828
It's a 3.5 carat.
Maybe 3.8.

335
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,896
It's a nice stone.
It's Asscher cut.

336
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:26,997
Thank you.

337
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:28,466
Good color.

338
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,868
Probably an F, or a G.

339
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:36,607
Nothing visible,
so at least a VS2.

340
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:37,641
Wanna know how much it's worth?

341
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,776
No.

342
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,581
You really don't, do you?

343
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,049
I really don't.

344
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,886
So, have you set a date?

345
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:50,988
Not yet.

346
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,792
I really want to get married in
the Church. And he's okay with that.

347
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:58,128
He was married before, so I
thought that would be a problem.

348
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,599
But the church doesn't recognize
other marriages, so...

349
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,434
Are you nervous?

350
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:04,635
A little bit.

351
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:07,071
Sometimes I am.

352
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,006
So, you're a church lady?

353
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:13,143
I go. It's important to me.

354
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,513
And what about confession?

355
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,147
Yeah.

356
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,782
Well, maybe not so much.

357
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,953
Does the priest
ever ask you about sex?

358
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:27,625
He doesn't ask, but you're
supposed to tell him everything.

359
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:28,792
And all the nasty shit you did,

360
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:30,528
you're just
supposed to pretend like

361
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,162
you're never gonna
do it again, right?

362
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,498
I guess.

363
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,866
Hmm. Strange.

364
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:45,509
And suppose you've done
something really nasty?

365
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:47,278
He doesn't press
you for the details?

366
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:52,816
I don't think so.

367
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,520
You're blushing.

368
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:58,689
Mm-mmm.

369
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,492
Okay,
we can change the subject.

370
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:03,627
We'll talk about my sex life.

371
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:06,664
You're teasing.

372
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,568
Just rattling your cage.

373
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,840
What a world.

374
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,881
Do you think
the world is strange?

375
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:25,683
(LAUGHS)

376
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,887
I meant yours.

377
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,527
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Reiner, are you there?</i>

378
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:37,695
<i>Counselor.</i>

379
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:39,229
I think I'm in.

380
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:42,232
<i>You can't think, Counselor.</i>
<i>You're in or you're out.</i>

381
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:45,269
All right, I'm in. And thanks.

382
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,237
Don't thank me yet.

383
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,608
I won't say, "I hope you know what
you're doing" because you don't.

384
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,777
<i>But, money problems</i>
<i>are serious problems.</i>

385
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,647
<i>You keep telling yourself
it's not as bad as it appears</i>

386
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,716
and then one morning,
you realize it's worse.

387
00:26:58,718 --> 00:26:58,716
<i>Am I close?</i>

388
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:01,885
My back is against
the fucking wall, man.

389
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,288
I believe you.

390
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:07,992
Do you have the cash?

391
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:09,927
I'll have it Thursday.

392
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:11,095
<i>All right.</i>

393
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,664
I'll call
Westray and set it up.

394
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,081
Counselor.
Westray.

395
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,523
It's not dark
enough in here for you?

396
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,154
Wow.

397
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,056
That's a dandy. What happened?

398
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:40,891
Confrontation with a doorman.

399
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,693
"Confrontation"?

400
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:44,828
Jesus.
What did you say to him?

401
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,631
I think I told him that he was
not to take it personally

402
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:48,766
but he should go fuck himself.

403
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:50,134
What did he say to that?

404
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:52,770
He said, "I'm gonna hurt
you, white person."

405
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:53,904
BARTENDER: What will you have?

406
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:55,239
I'll have a Heineken.

407
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:57,141
Make it two.

408
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:59,977
I didn't know you
got into donnybrooks.

409
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:01,078
I don't.

410
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,680
Anyway,
it was in another country.

411
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:07,151
And besides,
the wretch is dead.

412
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:11,755
No, but I sent a pair of reliable
chaps to speak with him.

413
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:13,657
Bloody expensive, too.

414
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:14,658
You surprise me.

415
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,927
Counselor,
I'm just a middle man.

416
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:20,931
I know the smallest
crumb can devour us.

417
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:25,135
You learn not to let anything pass.
You can't afford to.

418
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:26,737
I should keep that in mind.

419
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:30,808
You might keep that in mind.
So, fire away.

420
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,377
All right.
What do you do with the money?

421
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,112
What do I do,
or what does one do?

422
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:36,180
What do you do?

423
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,817
Mine goes offshore.

424
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:41,485
We can talk about it if you like,
but you can't use my people.

425
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,287
All right.

426
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,723
Okay. Let me make a call.

427
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:46,824
All right.

428
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:48,892
What else?

429
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,694
You seem unsettled.

430
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:52,062
I'm all right.

431
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,298
Uh...

432
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,933
What's the buy-out
for this whole deal?

433
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:58,102
Net net?

434
00:28:58,104 --> 00:29:00,237
Yeah. Net net.

435
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,772
It's hard to put
a cold dollar on it.

436
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:03,974
You don't know what your
expenses are up front.

437
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:08,312
It's 625 kilos, goes for about
$50 an ounce in Colombia.

438
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:11,849
And the street value in Dallas
can go as high as two grand.

439
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:13,383
Is that where it's going?
Dallas?

440
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:15,853
No, it's going to Chicago.
Don't write that down.

441
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:17,888
We're probably
looking at 20 million.

442
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,523
Maybe a little more.

443
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,894
It's 21,900 ounces.

444
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:25,729
Good return on your investment.

445
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:27,231
Did you do that in your head?

446
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:30,000
No, I remembered it.

447
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:32,402
But I know someone who
could do that in her head.

448
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,105
I'll bet you're right.

449
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,910
If you're not in,
you need to tell me.

450
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,812
I'm all right.

451
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,848
Here we go.

452
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,725
No, you're good.

453
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:55,859
Thank you.

454
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:57,728
Well, cheers.

455
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:01,231
A plague of pustulant boils
upon all their scurvid asses.

456
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:02,933
Is that your normal toast?

457
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:04,301
Increasingly.

458
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:10,073
So, if the drug wars stop

459
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,508
this will dry up, right?

460
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,877
Let's just say,
it will be more than risky.

461
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:17,481
That's the thing
Reiner doesn't seem to get.

462
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,449
You may have
noticed his lifestyle

463
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:21,318
has become increasingly lavish.

464
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,420
I've noticed.

465
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:26,890
I don't set foot in his clubs.
And I miss the bastard.

466
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:30,928
We used to share
a taste for exotic women.

467
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:34,198
In fact, a few times
shared the women themselves.

468
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,080
That wouldn't include the
present one, would it?

469
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,870
Now, why would you ask me that?

470
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:43,907
No reason. Sorry.

471
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:46,043
The answer is no, of course.
The civil answer.

472
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:48,478
But I see a murky picture
forming in that mind of yours.

473
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,348
How well do you know Malkina?

474
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,918
Not very well. Why?

475
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,421
Because you don't know someone
until you know what they want

476
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:58,622
is why.

477
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,558
I'll try and remember that.

478
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,626
Good.

479
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:06,930
And Reiner?

480
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:08,198
Reiner.

481
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,901
Reiner is beyond advising.

482
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:13,270
Reiner thinks
nothing bad can happen.

483
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:15,973
And he's in love.

484
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:17,975
You two are going
to open a new club?

485
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,576
Is that all right?

486
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,979
Sure. Why not?
What the fuck.

487
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:24,081
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

488
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,984
Do you know how many people were
killed in Juarez last year?

489
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,986
No. A lot.

490
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:32,489
Yeah. I think
3,000 is a lot.

491
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:35,158
This is a different species,
Counselor.

492
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,928
They will rip out your liver
and feed it to your dog.

493
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,299
I should keep
that in mind, too.

494
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,637
I can't advise you, Counselor.

495
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,874
But you are advising me.

496
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:54,044
I just need you to be sure
that you're locked in.

497
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:58,849
Because I don't know...

498
00:31:58,851 --> 00:32:02,619
Maybe I should tell you what Mickey
Rourke told what's-his-face.

499
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:05,556
That's my recommendation
anyway, Counselor.

500
00:32:05,582 --> 00:32:06,490
Don't do it.

501
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:08,592
"This arson is
a serious crime."

502
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:11,328
Yeah. And so is this.

503
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,134
I guess I'm
a little taken aback at

504
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:20,504
the cautionary nature
of this conversation.

505
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:22,906
Good word, "cautionary."

506
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:24,641
In Scots law, it
defines an instrument

507
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:27,110
in which one person stands
as surety for another.

508
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,146
As surety.
Yes.

509
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:30,981
Sounds a bit primitive.

510
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:31,982
It is.

511
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:34,117
The problem being, of course

512
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,721
is what happens when the surety
becomes the more attractive holding?

513
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,023
What about you?

514
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:45,295
I can vanish in a heartbeat
with my money. Can you?

515
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:49,666
Truth is, Counselor, I can walk
away from all of this in a second.

516
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,902
And I mean all of it.

517
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:54,504
You're not gonna believe this, but
I'm going to tell you anyway.

518
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:56,940
I think about my life.

519
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:58,475
I can live in a monastery.

520
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:02,646
Scrub the steps, clean the
pots, try some gardening.

521
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,615
You're serious.

522
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,617
Very.

523
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:08,685
Why don't you?

524
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:12,322
In a word? Women.

525
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,125
(LAUGHS)

526
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,131
I've seen it all, Counselor.

527
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:24,634
It's all shit.
It's all shit.

528
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,571
I'll be in touch.

529
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,441
Hey, Counselor?

530
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:34,144
You want to know why Jesus
wasn't born in Mexico?

531
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:35,278
No, why?

532
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,281
Couldn't find three
wise men or a virgin.

533
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:39,349
(SCOFFS)

534
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,422
And, Counselor, here's
something else to consider.

535
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:48,725
The beheadings and the mutilations?
That's just business.

536
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:51,061
You gotta keep up appearances.

537
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:54,965
It's not like there's some
smoldering rage at the bottom of it.

538
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:57,601
Let's see if we can guess who
it is they really want to kill.

539
00:33:57,603 --> 00:33:59,503
I don't know. Who?

I wear a five.

get his money back,

and get out of there.

keep the dance floor?

Yeah.

a girl at a bar,

tell you to fuck off.

She doesn't want to
look like a bitch.

651

But, you ask a chick to dance,

652
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,766
well, you got a better shot.

space-eater is the bandstand.

is take the wall out

and get rid of
the hallway, yeah.

656

go back a ways.

We do, I'm afraid.

Don't be afraid.

687
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:24,293
Hell, I'm okay with everything.

688

Are you okay with everything,

I am if you are.

All right, Tony, let's go.

692

How long have you known
this guy, petunia?

693
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:36,706
Long enough.

694
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:36,706
Long enough.

695
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:39,776
Maybe you should listen
to your lady friend.

697
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:41,878
Pretty much.

698
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,040
Does he keep you entertained?

like you might get bored easy.

keep your seat.

704

You don't have
to get up for me.

way of sullin' up like a possum

you probably noticed it.

But that ain't
really the problem.

709
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,701
The real problem is

his thin skin makes
it okay in his eyes

711
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:08,705

up under the bus.

Father, for I have sinned.

724
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,406
And?

725
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,711
How long has it been
since your last confession?

726
00:46:21,713 --> 00:46:24,247
Well, I've never been before.

727
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,849
This is my first.

728
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,351
Are you Catholic?

729
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:29,919
No.

730
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,322
Then I cannot
give you absolution.

731
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:34,757
I know

732
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:36,893
but I just wanted to tell
somebody what I had done

733
00:46:36,895 --> 00:46:38,928
and I thought, "Why not
go to a professional?"

734
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:41,030
Have you thought about
taking instructions?

735
00:46:41,032 --> 00:46:43,065
That's not
something I do very well.

736
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:45,201
I mean, in order to
become a Catholic.

737
00:46:45,203 --> 00:46:47,003
Then you could confess

738
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:48,971
and you will be
forgiven for your sins.

739
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:52,308
What if they're unforgivable?

740
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:55,745
Nothing is unforgivable.

741
00:46:55,747 --> 00:46:57,213
Oh, yeah?

742
00:46:57,215 --> 00:47:00,917
Well, I haven't killed anybody,
but I've been pretty bad.

743
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:03,753
Look, we have people here
waiting to go to confession

744
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:04,921
so, I'm sorry.

745
00:47:04,923 --> 00:47:06,289
They can wait.

746
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:09,225
I did.

747
00:47:09,227 --> 00:47:10,793
Who did you talk to about this?

748
00:47:10,795 --> 00:47:12,395
Why did I talk to somebody?

749
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:14,197
You said "Bless me, Father."

750
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:16,933
Well, I asked a friend but she
didn't know I was gonna do it.

751
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:18,501
So we're done here then?

752
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,436
I haven't told you my sins yet.

753
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:23,139
I don't want to hear your sins.
There would be no point.

754
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,242
Were you baptized?

755
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:28,411
I don't know. It's possible.

756
00:47:28,413 --> 00:47:29,779
Your parents never told you?

757
00:47:29,781 --> 00:47:31,781
I never knew my parents.

758
00:47:31,783 --> 00:47:33,850
They were thrown out of a
helicopter into the Atlantic Ocean

759
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:35,184
when I was three.

760
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,421
Listen

761
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:40,489
you don't have to do
the whole forgiveness thing.

762
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:42,625
All you have to do is listen.

763
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:45,127
To the sins.

764
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,832
Women tell you
about sex, don't they?

765
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:52,501
I can't talk about that.

766
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:55,938
Yeah, but every woman who
goes to confess tells you

767
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,140
that she's an adulterer or
fornicator or something

768
00:47:58,142 --> 00:48:00,843
or why else would she be there?

769
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:05,248
So you must have a very
unusual picture of women.

770
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,017
You must think that they're
just having sex all the time...

771
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:09,852
You really need to go now.

772
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:11,988
If you don't leave, I leave.

773
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,222
Wait, where are you going?

774
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,392
I wasn't finished.

775
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,197
I don't know.

776
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,300
Women have funny
ideas about sex.

777
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,404
They're supposed
to be so modest.

778
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:30,907
Let me tell you,
when they get it

779
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:32,341
in their heads how
they want to fuck

780
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:33,576
they're like a freight train.

781
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:36,145
Sign here.

782
00:48:36,147 --> 00:48:39,081
The things I've
learned about women.

783
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,216
Fuck.

784
00:48:40,218 --> 00:48:42,885
About half of it I
would like to forget.

785
00:48:42,887 --> 00:48:44,854
I'm not sure if I follow you.

786
00:48:44,856 --> 00:48:47,356
What is it you would like
to forget, for instance?

787
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:49,258
You don't want to know.

788
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,361
Sure I do.

789
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,965
I don't know.
Let's talk about something else.

790
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:57,967
Here.

791
00:48:57,969 --> 00:49:00,269
COUNSELOR: Just pull up your
socks and tell me.

792
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:04,006
Yeah

793
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,176
I don't know.

794
00:49:07,178 --> 00:49:09,111
What is it you
would like to forget?

795
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,980
All right.

796
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:13,082
I would like to forget about
Malkina fucking my car.

797
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:14,917
What?

798
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:16,085
See?

799
00:49:16,087 --> 00:49:17,887
What did you just say?

800
00:49:17,889 --> 00:49:21,657
I said I would like to forget
about Malkina fucking my car.

801
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:24,894
What the hell are
you talking about?

802
00:49:24,896 --> 00:49:27,430
Do you remember
that yellow California I had?

803
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,398
Sure. Nice car.

804
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,467
Very nice car.

805
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:36,405
Anyway, this was a while back,
not that long.

806
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:41,010
We'd been getting it on for a
while, and we came back one night.

807
00:49:41,012 --> 00:49:44,013
<i>We were staying</i>
<i>up at Cloudcroft.</i>

808
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:48,050
<i>We drove out on a golf course</i>
<i>and parked.</i>

809
00:49:48,052 --> 00:49:50,086
And we're sitting there,
talking

810
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:53,689
and for no particular reason
that I could see,

811
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:56,959
she slides off her knickers

812
00:49:56,961 --> 00:49:59,595
<i>and hands them to me</i>
<i>and gets out of the car.</i>

813
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:01,130
I asked her what she was doing

814
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:04,000
and she says, "I'm going
to fuck your car."

815
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:06,035
All right.

816
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:08,037
Leave the door open.

817
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:14,110
<i>So</i>

818
00:50:14,112 --> 00:50:18,581
<i>she goes around and climbs up</i>
<i>on the hood of the Ferrari</i>

819
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:23,986
<i>and pulls her dress up</i>
<i>around her waist</i>

820
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:26,489
<i>and spreads herself</i>
<i>across the windshield</i>

821
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:30,226
<i>in front of me</i>
<i>with no panties on.</i>

822
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:35,464
<i>And she's had this Brazilian
wax job, you know?</i>

823
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:37,299
Don't even think
I'm making this up.

824
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:39,201
You can't make
this up, all right?

825
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,070
<i>I mean, she was a dancer.</i>

826
00:50:41,072 --> 00:50:44,473
<i>So, she does this full split</i>

827
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:49,712
<i>and then she starts rubbing
herself up and down on the glass.</i>

828
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:52,748
<i>Then she leans down</i>
<i>to see if I'm watching.</i>

829
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,451
<i>Like, no, I'm sitting there</i>
<i>reading my email.</i>

830
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:59,388
<i>And she kisses me upside down.</i>

831
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,190
<i>And then she tells me</i>
<i>that she's going to come.</i>

832
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:04,126
<i>I thought, "I'm losing my fucking mind.
That's what's happening here."</i>

833
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:07,096
<i>It was like one of those,</i>

834
00:51:07,098 --> 00:51:11,367
one of those catfish things.
You know? One of those...

835
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:15,037
One of those
bottom-feeders you see

836
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:16,639
going up the side
of the aquarium,

837
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:19,375
sucking its way up the glass.

838
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:21,710
<i>I mean, it was, I don't know...</i>

839
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:23,712
(MOANS)

840
00:51:23,714 --> 00:51:25,181
hallucinatory.

841
00:51:25,183 --> 00:51:28,117
You see a thing like that,
it changes you.

842
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,087
Jesus.

843
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:32,655
Yeah, tell me about it.

844
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:35,825
Did she?

845
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,228
Did she what?

846
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:41,664
Did she come?

847
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:45,134
Yeah. Sure, yeah.

848
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:47,103
<i>Finally she climbs down</i>
<i>and she comes around</i>

849
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:49,171
<i>and she gets in the car</i>
<i>and shuts the door.</i>

850
00:51:49,173 --> 00:51:51,340
I hand her her knickers,
she puts them in her purse

851
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:54,710
and she looks at me to see
what I thought about that.

852
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,814
<i>What I thought about it?</i>

853
00:51:58,816 --> 00:52:01,150
Well, I don't know
what I thought about it.

854
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:04,820
I mean, I still don't.

855
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:09,592
It was too gynecological to be sexy.
Almost.

856
00:52:09,594 --> 00:52:11,627
But mostly,
I was just fucking stunned.

857
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:13,429
(LAUGHING)

858
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:15,131
And I asked her if she had
ever done that before

859
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:17,613
and she said she had done everything
before. And I believe her.

860
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:20,136
(SIGHS)

861
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:23,739
Jesus. Catfish?

862
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:26,575
I don't know.
I think so, yeah.

863
00:52:26,577 --> 00:52:28,077
Do you think she knew what kind

864
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,578
of effect this
might have on a guy?

865
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:32,715
Jesus, Counselor, are you kidding?
She knows everything.

866
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:38,187
You don't think this is
an odd thing to tell me?

867
00:52:38,189 --> 00:52:40,189
I think it is an odd thing.

868
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:41,790
No, I mean,
why is it okay to tell

869
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:43,392
a thing like that
about somebody...

870
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:45,628
Somebody I'm banging?

871
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:49,198
Come on, Reiner.

872
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,568
Okay, I don't know,
you're probably right.

873
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:55,371
Maybe I wanted to see
what you would say.

874
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:58,474
Maybe there's more to it than that.
Maybe I'm scared.

875
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:00,509
You're scared?

876
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:01,610
Yeah.

877
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:04,446
Probably, yeah. Sometimes...

878
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:07,116
She scares the shit out of me.

879
00:53:07,118 --> 00:53:08,651
Because of that?

880
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:10,319
No, not that. But...

881
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:13,255
You're in love with her.

882
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:15,157
I don't know what I am.

883
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:18,260
Yeah, I guess
I'm in love with her, but

884
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:21,730
you don't think
that's cause for worry?

885
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:24,567
It's like being in love with

886
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:28,637
easeful death.

887
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:30,999
Well, I don't know what it is
that you're trying to tell me.

888
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:32,908
I know.

889
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,345
Does this have anything
to do with the deal?

890
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:38,948
I don't know.

891
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:43,919
You're right.

892
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:45,888
I shouldn't have told you.

893
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,756
Just forget it. Forget it.

894
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:49,725
Forget it?
Yeah.

895
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,494
How do you propose I do that?

896
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:55,197
Jesus, Counselor,
how do I know?

897
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:56,532
Just forget it.

because of her youth and beauty.

1061
01:07:24,274 --> 01:07:26,441

I don't mean to offend you

all prepare a place

1421
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:32,692
<i>Machado was a schoolteacher</i>

1422

<i>and he married a young,</i>
<i>beautiful girl.</i>

01:35:43,805 --> 01:35:46,139
I'm not going to
become a great poet.

1427
01:35:46,141 --> 01:35:49,008
<i>No, perhaps not.
But even if you were to do so,</i>

1428
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:51,444
<i>it would not help you.</i>

1429
01:35:51,446 --> 01:35:54,114
Machado would have
traded every word,

1430
01:35:54,116 --> 01:35:57,383
every poem,
every verse he ever wrote

1431
01:35:57,385 --> 01:36:01,020
for one more hour
with his beloved.

1432
01:36:01,022 --> 01:36:03,757
And that is because
when it comes to grief,

1433
01:36:03,759 --> 01:36:06,126
the normal rules of
exchange do not apply,

1434
01:36:06,128 --> 01:36:08,928
because grief transcends value.

1435
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:13,800
<i>A man would give entire nations
to lift grief off his heart</i>

1436
01:36:13,802 --> 01:36:17,737
and yet, you cannot buy
anything with grief.

1437
01:36:17,739 --> 01:36:21,374
Because grief is worthless.

1438
01:36:22,309 --> 01:36:24,911
Why are you telling me this?

1439
01:36:24,913 --> 01:36:30,817
<i>Because you continue to deny the
reality of the world you're in.</i>

1440
01:36:30,819 --> 01:36:33,887
<i>Do you love your wife so much,</i>
<i>so completely,</i>

1441
01:36:33,889 --> 01:36:38,925
<i>that you would exchange places
with her upon the wheel?</i>

1442
01:36:38,927 --> 01:36:42,128
And I don't mean dying,
because dying is easy.

1443
01:36:44,331 --> 01:36:47,400
Yes! Yes, damn you!

1444
01:36:50,504 --> 01:36:53,239
<i>Well, that is good</i>
<i>to hear, Counselor.</i>

1445
01:36:58,846 --> 01:37:00,880
What are you saying?

1446
01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:04,450
Are you saying
this is a possibility?

1447
01:37:04,952 --> 01:37:06,452
No.

1448
01:37:06,987 --> 01:37:08,588
It's impossible.

1449
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:12,192
You said I was that man

1450
01:37:12,194 --> 01:37:13,927
at that crossing.

1451
01:37:13,929 --> 01:37:16,796
<i>Yes. At the understanding</i>

1452
01:37:16,798 --> 01:37:21,601
<i>that life is not</i>

will also cease to exist.</i>

1455
01:37:32,848 --> 01:37:35,481
But for those with
the understanding that

1456
01:37:35,483 --> 01:37:38,351
they're living
the last days of the world,

1457
01:37:38,353 --> 01:37:42,555
death acquires
a different meaning.

1458
01:37:43,891 --> 01:37:47,193
The extinction of all reality

1459
01:37:47,195 --> 01:37:52,999
is a concept
no resignation can encompass.

1462
01:38:04,979 --> 01:38:07,347
<i>And now,</i>
<i>Counselor, I have to go,</i>

1604
01:52:06,387 --> 01:52:10,923
Yes, of course.
A thing like that is always sexual.

1605
01:52:12,058 --> 01:52:17,730
The hunter has grace, beauty,

1606
01:52:17,732 --> 01:52:21,700
and purity of heart
to be found nowhere else.

1607
01:52:21,702 --> 01:52:26,271
You can make no distinction between
what they are and what they do.

1608
01:52:26,273 --> 01:52:28,507
And what they do is kill.

1609
01:52:30,043 --> 01:52:33,278
We, of course,
are another matter.

1610
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:37,282
It is our faintness of heart that
has driven us to the edge of ruin.

1611
01:52:38,918 --> 01:52:42,254
Perhaps you won't agree

1612
01:52:42,256 --> 01:52:44,523
but nothing is
crueler than a coward.

1613
01:52:45,291 --> 01:52:47,726
And the slaughter to come

1614
01:52:47,728 --> 01:52:50,896
is probably
beyond our imagining.

1615
01:52:50,898 --> 01:52:54,233
I think you've told me
more than I wish to know.

1616
01:52:55,368 --> 01:52:57,302
Then I'll say no more.

1617
01:52:59,038 --> 01:53:01,774
Shall we think about ordering?

1618
01:53:02,642 --> 01:53:04,309
I'm famished.
