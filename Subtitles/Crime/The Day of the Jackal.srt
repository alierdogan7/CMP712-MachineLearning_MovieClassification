1
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:25,547
August, 1962
was a stormy time for France.

2
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:29,067
Many people felt that
President Charles De Gaulle...

3
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,590
...had betrayed the country
by giving independence to Algeria.

4
00:00:33,474 --> 00:00:35,908
Extremists, mostly from the army...

5
00:00:36,074 --> 00:00:38,190
...swore to kill him in revenge.

6
00:00:38,874 --> 00:00:41,434
They banded together
in an underground movement...

7
00:00:41,634 --> 00:00:44,944
...and called themselves the OAS.

8
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:30,989
The Minister's meeting is over!

9
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:37,707
They're very late.

10
00:05:03,794 --> 00:05:08,390
The time elapsed from the first
to the lastshot was seven seconds.

11
00:05:08,554 --> 00:05:12,388
In all, more than 140 shots were fired.

12
00:05:12,874 --> 00:05:15,388
Several bullets pierced the President's car.

13
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:17,863
One came within an inch of his head.

14
00:05:17,954 --> 00:05:22,903
But, as if by a miracle,
neither he nor anyone else was hurt.

15
00:05:24,714 --> 00:05:26,067
Six months later:

16
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,833
Most of the conspirators
have been caught and tried.

17
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:33,543
Their leader, Colonel Bastien-Thiry,
has been sentenced to death.

18
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:38,389
At the last moment, his lawyer
tries one more time for a stay of execution.

19
00:05:54,594 --> 00:05:57,267
The appeal for clemency
has been turned down.

20
00:05:57,354 --> 00:05:59,310
There is nothing more one can do.

21
00:05:59,554 --> 00:06:00,703
I am sorry.

22
00:06:01,514 --> 00:06:02,708
There is no need.

23
00:06:02,794 --> 00:06:06,150
For heaven's sake,
don't you realize you're going to be shot?

24
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:08,067
You don't understand.

25
00:06:08,554 --> 00:06:11,830
No French soldier is going to raise
his rifle against me.

26
00:06:18,114 --> 00:06:19,467
Fire!

27
00:06:20,674 --> 00:06:24,792
Here is the 8:00 news for today,
March 11, 1963.

28
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:28,469
An hour ago, in the courtyard
of the Fort d'Ivry, outside Paris...

29
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:32,429
...Lieutenant Colonel Bastien-Thiry
was executed by firing squad...

30
00:06:32,514 --> 00:06:36,189
...for leading the attempt on the life
of General De Gaulle last August.

31
00:06:36,274 --> 00:06:38,504
The OAS now seems
completely demoralized...

32
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:41,865
...by the splendid performance
of our national security forces.

33
00:06:42,074 --> 00:06:45,305
Already it is known that
the new chief of operations of the OAS...

34
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:48,665
...Colonel Mark Rodin, a former
paratroop commanderin Algeria...

35
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:52,071
...is on the run
and hiding somewhere in Austria.

36
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:55,790
Today's execution must surely mean
that the OAS is finished...

37
00:06:55,954 --> 00:06:57,433
...once and for all.

38
00:07:05,354 --> 00:07:07,584
What are the finances like, René?

39
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:12,112
No wonder our people are giving up.
They've lost faith.

40
00:07:12,194 --> 00:07:13,991
We've failed them every single time.

41
00:07:14,074 --> 00:07:15,223
We won't fail again!

42
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:17,152
What can we do? We're paralyzed.

43
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:20,749
Every cop in France knows us.
informants are all around us.

44
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:24,268
We must find an outsider. A foreigner.

45
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:27,392
-A foreigner? Why?
-A contract killer.

46
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:31,384
One that hasn't worked in France,
so he won't have a police record.

47
00:07:31,474 --> 00:07:35,228
-He can come and go as he pleases.
-That sort of person costs money.

48
00:07:35,314 --> 00:07:36,667
Yes.

49
00:07:38,194 --> 00:07:40,150
I'll find the right man.

50
00:07:41,434 --> 00:07:44,073
We'd better meet again
in three months, in Vienna.

51
00:07:44,154 --> 00:07:48,306
In the pension you both know:
Pension Kleist. June 15.

52
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:51,112
It's a limited market.

53
00:07:51,274 --> 00:07:53,230
I've compiled 11 dossiers
over three months.

54
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:56,067
Only those four men
seemed anywhere near right.

55
00:07:56,994 --> 00:07:59,383
Now that you've read the files,
what do you think?

56
00:07:59,474 --> 00:08:02,272
-One Englishman did all these jobs?
-I don't believe it.

57
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:05,272
-It's true.
-He did that fellow in the Congo?

58
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:06,707
And Trujillo?

59
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:09,186
-Yes.
-That's our man then, isn'tit?

60
00:08:09,274 --> 00:08:11,424
I should say so.

61
00:08:11,714 --> 00:08:13,830
I'm glad you agree on the final choice.

62
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:16,584
-Because he'll be here any moment.
-What?

63
00:08:16,874 --> 00:08:19,308
He's arriving this afternoon from London.

64
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:48,273
Wolenski.

65
00:08:56,034 --> 00:08:58,707
A normal precaution, you understand.
Come in.

66
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:11,424
We are not terrorists, you understand.
We are patriots.

67
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:14,792
Our duty is to the soldiers
who died fighting in Algeria...

68
00:09:14,874 --> 00:09:17,627
...and the 3 million French citizens
who live there.

69
00:09:17,714 --> 00:09:19,830
You want to get rid of him?

70
00:09:21,634 --> 00:09:24,273
Speaking as a professional,
do you think it's possible?

71
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:28,785
It's possible.
The point is getting away with it.

72
00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:31,828
As a professional,
it's an important consideration.

73
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:34,269
In principle, you'd say it could be done?

74
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:38,793
Yes. With enough time and planning.

75
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:42,189
It would be more difficult
than most targets.

76
00:09:42,274 --> 00:09:43,150
Why more?

77
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:46,385
Because De Gaulle has
the best security in the world.

78
00:09:46,714 --> 00:09:48,750
Their information is first-class.

79
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:52,112
You see, gentlemen,
not only have your own efforts failed...

80
00:09:52,194 --> 00:09:54,310
...but you've queered the pitch for others.

81
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:57,830
-How dare you suggest..
-You can't afford to be emotional.

82
00:09:58,034 --> 00:09:59,911
It's why you've made so many mistakes.

83
00:10:00,714 --> 00:10:04,548
-If we decided to employ a professional--
-You have to employ a professional.

84
00:10:04,634 --> 00:10:07,068
Your organization is
so riddled with informers...

85
00:10:07,154 --> 00:10:10,146
...that nothing you decide
is a secret for long.

86
00:10:10,954 --> 00:10:13,104
The job would have to be done
by an outsider.

87
00:10:13,194 --> 00:10:16,186
The only question is
by whom and for how much?

88
00:10:17,914 --> 00:10:19,267
Will you do it?

89
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:22,262
-Yes.
-How much?

90
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:24,663
Understand, this is a once-in-a-lifetime job.

91
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:26,745
-They can never work again.
-How much?

92
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,426
-Half a million, in cash.
-What?

93
00:10:28,514 --> 00:10:30,425
Half in advance and half on completion.

94
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:32,505
-Half a million francs?
-Dollars.

95
00:10:33,514 --> 00:10:34,390
Are you mad?

96
00:10:34,474 --> 00:10:37,830
Considering you'd get France in return,
I thought it a reasonable price.

97
00:10:38,194 --> 00:10:41,823
But if you can't manage it,
there's nothing more to be said.

98
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:44,509
We accept.

99
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:49,151
How many people know about this?

100
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:51,429
-Just the four of us.
-Let's keep it that way.

101
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:54,149
This job depends on absolute secrecy.

102
00:10:54,314 --> 00:10:55,872
No notes must be kept.

103
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:58,752
If any of you is captured, I shall call it off.

104
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:02,588
I suggest you stay in a safe place under
guard until the work is done. Agreed?

105
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:04,343
Agreed.

106
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:06,826
The planning will be mine.

107
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:10,191
No one else will get the details
and you won't hear from me again.

108
00:11:10,274 --> 00:11:13,107
Here's the name and account number
of my bank in Switzerland.

109
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:16,789
When they tell me the first $250,000
has been deposited, I'll move...

110
00:11:16,954 --> 00:11:18,182
...provided I'm ready.

111
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:20,345
But I'll not be hurried in any way.

112
00:11:21,354 --> 00:11:22,389
Agreed.

113
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,863
All I want from you is
a phone number in Paris...

114
00:11:24,954 --> 00:11:27,514
...that I can call
about changes in De Gaulle's plans.

115
00:11:27,594 --> 00:11:30,233
The contact mustn't know
who I am or what this is about.

116
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,713
Send me the number by mail.

117
00:11:31,794 --> 00:11:34,388
How do you expect us
to find the money so soon?

118
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:36,510
Use your network to rob some banks.

119
00:11:36,954 --> 00:11:38,433
One last thing.

120
00:11:41,194 --> 00:11:43,150
What code name will you use?

121
00:11:43,714 --> 00:11:45,113
Why not "The Jackal"?

122
00:11:46,074 --> 00:11:47,302
Why not?

123
00:11:48,754 --> 00:11:52,269
There's nothing more you want from us.
You'll be working completely alone.

124
00:11:52,354 --> 00:11:55,551
Not completely.
One will have the cooperation of De Gaulle.

125
00:11:56,794 --> 00:12:01,151
He won't listen to his security service
and stay out of the public eye.

126
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:05,231
A pleasant journey home, Mr. Jackal.

127
00:12:42,274 --> 00:12:45,550
960,000 francs? This has got to stop!

128
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:47,352
You're the Chief of Action Service.

129
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,187
You've had 3 weeks to find out
if the OAS is involved...

130
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:53,664
-...and if they are, what are they up to?
-It is the OAS, General.

131
00:12:54,194 --> 00:12:56,230
But the ones we've caught are small fry.

132
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:59,107
They've been ordered to do it,
but they don't know why.

133
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:00,912
The Minister's been after me again.

134
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:03,383
We've questioned all known OAS people.

135
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:05,266
They know nothing.

136
00:13:05,354 --> 00:13:07,470
-What about the informers?
-Nothing.

137
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:11,583
But we found out this morning
that Rodin and the other two are in Rome.

138
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:13,505
They arrived on June 18.

139
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:16,154
They've taken the two top floors
in Hotel Garibaldi.

140
00:13:16,234 --> 00:13:19,112
-You're watching them, of course?
-Twenty-four hours a day.

141
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:48,871
'Morning. Birth certificate, please.
Paul Oliver Duggan.

142
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:52,549
Born in the parish of Sambourne Fishley,
April 3, 1929.

143
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:55,586
Fill in the form.
You'll find the 1929's up those stairs...

144
00:14:55,674 --> 00:14:58,268
-...and left at the first gallery.
-Right. Thanks.

145
00:16:37,154 --> 00:16:38,507
Thank you, sir.

146
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:44,904
Excuse me, please.
How many krone to the pound?

147
00:16:45,514 --> 00:16:48,426
The official parity rate is 19.34.

148
00:17:03,994 --> 00:17:06,508
Hello. Two bottles of hairpin, please.

149
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:09,267
One in chestnut brown and one in gray.

150
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:13,823
I've only got Clairol, dear.

151
00:17:14,474 --> 00:17:17,784
That's fine. And also a tin of solvent.

152
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:31,268
-lt is here.
-ls it?

153
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,508
Hello?

154
00:17:45,634 --> 00:17:46,987
Yes.

155
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:49,032
Hello, Zurich?

156
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:51,385
Mr. Kola, this is he.

157
00:17:51,634 --> 00:17:54,353
That's right. Account Number 50664.

158
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,226
The money's been deposited.

159
00:17:58,074 --> 00:17:59,109
How much?

160
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:22,023
Alitalia announces the departure
of Flight 127 to Genova.

161
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:24,469
Now boarding at Gate 5.

162
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:46,153
The Hotel Garibaldi is owned
by a Frenchman with OAS sympathies.

163
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:50,147
Extra Action Service staff have been sent
from Paris to Rome...

164
00:18:50,314 --> 00:18:52,669
...to keep watching them around-the-clock.

165
00:18:54,554 --> 00:18:58,627
Rodin, Montclair and Casson
live at the top floor alone.

166
00:18:59,114 --> 00:19:01,389
On the next floor down
are the bodyguards...

167
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,113
...ex-paratroopers or foreign legionnaires.

168
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:06,265
-How many?
-Eight.

169
00:19:06,594 --> 00:19:10,428
-They're afraid of being kidnapped.
-I know Rodin. He's not a man to be afraid.

170
00:19:10,514 --> 00:19:13,506
The lift doors on the top floor
are welded together...

171
00:19:13,594 --> 00:19:15,903
...and everything goes through
the bodyguards.

172
00:19:15,994 --> 00:19:19,384
Not one of them has set a foot
outside the hotel for five weeks.

173
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:22,068
The only contact
with the outside world is one man:

174
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:24,793
-Adjutant Wolenski.
-Tell me about him.

175
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:26,751
Bersie, run the film, please.

176
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:33,512
This is Wolenski.

177
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,512
He goes to the post office
every morning and afternoon.

178
00:19:40,594 --> 00:19:41,913
See that?

179
00:19:42,394 --> 00:19:45,864
You'll have to cut his hand off
to get the mail away from him.

180
00:19:58,194 --> 00:20:02,392
He always waits until the collection van
arrives before he posts any letters.

181
00:20:02,474 --> 00:20:04,226
Then he goes to pick up the mail.

182
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:16,022
All their mail comes to general delivery
and is addressed in the name of Partrier.

183
00:20:16,514 --> 00:20:19,312
Wolenski, of course,
can identify himself as such.

184
00:20:24,594 --> 00:20:25,913
Colonel Rolland here.

185
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:29,669
I want everything you've got
in the archives on a foreign legionnaire.

186
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:31,312
His name is Viktor Wolenski.

187
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:35,546
If the OAS is planning something big,
their agents must be working on it now.

188
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,512
You must find out who they are
and where they make contact.

189
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:02,945
I let myself in.

190
00:21:05,154 --> 00:21:07,031
l'll make us some coffee.

191
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:11,753
Denise.

192
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:17,870
I ask you to get rid of these.
It's for your own safety.

193
00:21:18,914 --> 00:21:20,267
I'll do it tonight.

194
00:21:20,394 --> 00:21:22,464
Maybe I should do it for you now.

195
00:21:24,514 --> 00:21:27,108
They know all about your fiancé.

196
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:40,792
I have an assignment for you
that sounds very important.

197
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:42,872
It's not very pleasant.

198
00:21:45,074 --> 00:21:46,348
Go on.

199
00:21:52,074 --> 00:21:55,384
They want you to get involved
with an official of the Élysée Palace...

200
00:21:55,994 --> 00:21:58,030
...someone fairly close to De Gaulle.

201
00:21:58,954 --> 00:22:00,831
It might be dangerous.

202
00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:03,265
It's certainly distasteful.

203
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:09,392
Who is this official?

204
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:12,108
I'll show him to you in a week or so.

205
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:38,786
Good afternoon.

206
00:22:39,034 --> 00:22:41,867
Yes, please come in.

207
00:22:44,674 --> 00:22:46,187
You think you can do it?

208
00:22:47,314 --> 00:22:48,429
Certainly.

209
00:22:48,514 --> 00:22:51,392
I can take an existing gun,
make the modifications.

210
00:22:51,474 --> 00:22:55,069
It must be very light in weight,
and it must have a short barrel.

211
00:22:55,154 --> 00:22:58,066
A short barrel. That's a pity.

212
00:22:58,634 --> 00:23:02,343
Lastly, there must be a silencer
and a telescopic sight.

213
00:23:05,474 --> 00:23:08,307
Over what range will you fire?

214
00:23:08,594 --> 00:23:11,984
I'm not sure yet,
but probably not more than 400 feet.

215
00:23:12,114 --> 00:23:14,912
-Will the gentleman be moving?
-Stationary.

216
00:23:15,234 --> 00:23:18,146
Will you go for a head shot
or a chest shot?

217
00:23:18,394 --> 00:23:19,873
Probably head.

218
00:23:20,034 --> 00:23:22,104
What about the chances of a second shot?

219
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:24,264
I might get the chance, but I doubt it.

220
00:23:24,594 --> 00:23:26,903
In any event, I'll need a silencer to escape.

221
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:30,348
In that case,
you better have explosive bullets.

222
00:23:31,074 --> 00:23:34,783
-I can prepare a handful for you.
-Glycerin or mercury?

223
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:37,830
Mercury, I think.

224
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:41,352
It's much cleaner.

225
00:23:42,034 --> 00:23:44,264
-More Campari?
-No, thank you.

226
00:23:44,834 --> 00:23:46,153
It seems then...

227
00:23:46,474 --> 00:23:49,989
...the gun must be carried past customs
without arousing suspicion.

228
00:23:53,274 --> 00:23:54,992
Recognize that?

229
00:23:59,034 --> 00:24:02,106
The whole thing should be made
of hollow aluminium tubes...

230
00:24:02,194 --> 00:24:04,662
...which screw together. The top one...

231
00:24:04,914 --> 00:24:08,907
...holds the rifle strut. The one below,
the bolt with the breech inside it.

232
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:12,347
The shoulder rest of the rifle
doubles for both purposes...

233
00:24:12,434 --> 00:24:14,902
-...without changing in any way.
-That's excellent.

234
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:18,191
The last two sections house
the telescopic sight and silencer.

235
00:24:18,554 --> 00:24:19,907
Here.

236
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:25,224
It's very remarkable. It's so simple.

237
00:24:25,354 --> 00:24:27,629
I shall need the gun in about two weeks.

238
00:24:28,994 --> 00:24:31,030
If you could meet me here...

239
00:24:31,994 --> 00:24:35,543
...August 13, you could try out
the gun and discuss last minute details.

240
00:24:35,634 --> 00:24:37,386
Very well. August 13.

241
00:24:37,474 --> 00:24:39,510
Now the question of your fee.

242
00:24:44,514 --> 00:24:48,553
I have to ask a fee of 1,000 pounds
for this kind of a job...

243
00:24:49,434 --> 00:24:51,868
...you see and, say...

244
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:55,748
...another 100 or 200 pounds
for the raw materials.

245
00:24:56,554 --> 00:24:57,748
Done.

246
00:24:58,074 --> 00:25:02,431
I'll pay you half the fee now
and the rest on delivery.

247
00:25:32,914 --> 00:25:34,870
What do you think? Marvelous?

248
00:25:36,674 --> 00:25:39,586
I knew you didn't come to Genova
for a driver's license.

249
00:25:39,714 --> 00:25:41,909
Anyone in London could've done that.

250
00:25:43,274 --> 00:25:45,913
Problem is I won't have time
to play around with makeup.

251
00:25:45,994 --> 00:25:48,872
-I'm not much good at it anyway.
-Forget about makeup.

252
00:25:48,954 --> 00:25:52,583
The important thing is the skin.
It must look gray and tired.

253
00:25:52,754 --> 00:25:57,032
We used a trick in the army to fake illness
and get out of fatigue duty.

254
00:25:57,114 --> 00:26:00,265
-Can you get hold of some cordite?
-I suppose so.

255
00:26:00,754 --> 00:26:03,268
You swallow a couple
of small pieces of cordite.

256
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:06,710
It'll make you feel sick
and turn the skin a gray color.

257
00:26:06,914 --> 00:26:08,142
After about an hour...

258
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:11,510
...you'll feel all right again,
but your skin looks gray much longer.

259
00:26:11,594 --> 00:26:12,993
I'll try it.

260
00:26:13,074 --> 00:26:14,905
What about the French documents?

261
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:17,469
French identity card's all right.

262
00:26:17,754 --> 00:26:20,712
The other one,
I don't think I've seen what they look like...

263
00:26:20,794 --> 00:26:22,113
...let alone copy it.

264
00:26:22,194 --> 00:26:25,664
I'll get a colleague in France to pick
a pocket so I can make a duplicate.

265
00:26:27,234 --> 00:26:30,385
Give me more time, more money.

266
00:26:31,234 --> 00:26:32,667
How much more?

267
00:26:33,034 --> 00:26:34,387
Five hundred.

268
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:36,986
Three hundred pounds?

269
00:26:38,954 --> 00:26:42,549
-Half now, half on delivery.
-When will I hear from you?

270
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:45,109
I'll be returning to Genova on August 14.

271
00:26:45,194 --> 00:26:47,947
Be in the same place
where we met tonight at 6:00.

272
00:26:49,114 --> 00:26:50,945
Must be a big job you've got.

273
00:26:51,074 --> 00:26:53,269
There are certain things
I wish to make clear.

274
00:26:53,354 --> 00:26:55,504
When you've finished,
I want the negatives...

275
00:26:55,594 --> 00:26:58,233
...and all the prints
of the photographs you've taken.

276
00:26:58,554 --> 00:27:00,545
You will also forget the name Duggan...

277
00:27:00,634 --> 00:27:03,626
...and the name on the French
documents you're going to produce.

278
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:05,511
Is that understood?

279
00:29:28,954 --> 00:29:31,832
Taking it easy? I wish I had your job.

280
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:35,305
All my tenants are on holiday.
What time is it?

281
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:38,029
-Half past 5:00.
-I must hurry.

282
00:29:38,114 --> 00:29:39,945
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.

283
00:31:33,754 --> 00:31:35,107
That's him. See?

284
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:38,470
In the light coat.
He's the official at the Élysée Palace.

285
00:31:39,794 --> 00:31:43,912
He'll pack his wife and children off
to the Loire Valley for the holiday.

286
00:31:43,994 --> 00:31:46,064
You haven't got much time.

287
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:49,707
I need Wolenski.

288
00:31:49,794 --> 00:31:52,262
Arrange to get him across the border.

289
00:31:52,594 --> 00:31:56,189
What? Never mind the Italian government.

290
00:31:56,594 --> 00:31:59,711
Once you have him inside France,
bring him to Paris immediately.

291
00:32:48,674 --> 00:32:51,188
You're being very foolish, Viktor.

292
00:32:53,634 --> 00:32:56,512
You know yourself,
they always talk in the end.

293
00:32:56,914 --> 00:33:00,873
You've seen it with your own two eyes
in lndochina.

294
00:33:04,154 --> 00:33:06,031
And in Algeria, of course.

295
00:33:09,514 --> 00:33:12,233
Tell us what they're waiting for
in that hotel!

296
00:33:21,514 --> 00:33:24,904
What are they planning?
Who have they been meeting with?

297
00:33:26,314 --> 00:33:29,192
Nobody? Not a soul?

298
00:33:32,034 --> 00:33:34,992
Then where were they
before they went to Rome?

299
00:33:38,354 --> 00:33:40,345
Tell us, Viktor.

300
00:33:48,554 --> 00:33:49,953
Go back a bit.

301
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:52,825
Hold it. Stop.

302
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:56,349
Question:

303
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,792
Rome, Viktor. Why did they go to Rome?

304
00:34:00,394 --> 00:34:02,191
-No answer.
-Check.

305
00:34:02,314 --> 00:34:04,782
Question: why are they in Rome?

306
00:34:04,914 --> 00:34:07,667
-Answer: secret.
-Check.

307
00:34:07,994 --> 00:34:11,703
Question: where did they stay
in Vienna, Viktor?

308
00:34:12,154 --> 00:34:13,985
-No answer.
-Check.

309
00:34:14,274 --> 00:34:15,866
Was it the house?

310
00:34:16,674 --> 00:34:19,234
I am asking you, was it a house?

311
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:21,628
Answer:

312
00:34:24,914 --> 00:34:26,472
Kleist.

313
00:34:30,674 --> 00:34:31,743
Go on.

314
00:34:33,954 --> 00:34:36,514
Question: who is Kleist?

315
00:34:37,514 --> 00:34:38,993
What does he do?

316
00:34:41,434 --> 00:34:45,313
What did they do to the bastard?
I can't understand a word.

317
00:34:45,394 --> 00:34:47,271
-Put it on the speakers.
-Where from?

318
00:34:47,354 --> 00:34:49,663
"Who is Kleist?" That bit.

319
00:34:52,714 --> 00:34:55,911
Eho is Kleist? Ehat does he do?

320
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,549
Jack? Jackie?

321
00:35:09,714 --> 00:35:12,023
-That wouldn't be Jackie? Would it?
-Jackie?

322
00:35:12,114 --> 00:35:13,467
That's not possible.

323
00:35:13,794 --> 00:35:16,513
Go back, and this time turn up the sound.

324
00:35:40,074 --> 00:35:41,746
Heel, Rex!

325
00:35:42,714 --> 00:35:44,272
Rex, come here!

326
00:35:54,754 --> 00:35:56,631
Are you all right?

327
00:35:57,554 --> 00:35:58,623
I think so.

328
00:35:58,714 --> 00:36:01,387
-Do you want me to call for an ambulance?
-No.

329
00:36:02,514 --> 00:36:04,152
Are you sure?

330
00:36:04,874 --> 00:36:06,705
I'll survive.

331
00:36:07,914 --> 00:36:10,474
There. See?

332
00:36:11,954 --> 00:36:13,546
I'm sorry.

333
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:15,468
It's not your fault.

334
00:36:19,674 --> 00:36:22,313
-Sorry to drag you away, Colonel.
-Nonsense.

335
00:36:22,394 --> 00:36:25,352
The tape is on your machine
in case you want to refer back...

336
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:27,789
-...and here is the transcript.
-Yes.

337
00:36:47,634 --> 00:36:49,113
Jackal.

338
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:51,704
I thought Wolenski used it
as a swear word...

339
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:53,512
...but it doesn't sound like him.

340
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:56,867
Fair.

341
00:37:00,994 --> 00:37:03,827
Excuse me, Colonel. The foreigner...

342
00:37:04,154 --> 00:37:06,714
...could it be a fair foreigner? A blonde?

343
00:37:11,554 --> 00:37:13,192
Is Kleist the foreigner?

344
00:37:18,434 --> 00:37:20,504
Colonel, it's 4:30.

345
00:37:31,474 --> 00:37:35,023
The plot described above constitutes,
in my view...

346
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:38,512
...the most dangerous single conception
that the terrorists...

347
00:37:38,994 --> 00:37:40,871
...could possibly have devised...

348
00:37:41,154 --> 00:37:44,464
...to endanger the life
of President De Gaulle.

349
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:48,110
If the plot exists as described...

350
00:37:48,674 --> 00:37:52,303
...and if a foreign-born assassin,
whose code name may be "Jackal"...

351
00:37:52,474 --> 00:37:55,864
...has, in fact, been engaged
for this attempt on the life..

352
00:37:55,954 --> 00:37:58,866
-Sorry.
-On the life of the President...

353
00:38:00,274 --> 00:38:03,505
...it is my duty to inform you,
Minister, that in my opinion...

354
00:38:03,794 --> 00:38:06,149
...we face a national emergency.

355
00:38:06,714 --> 00:38:08,113
New paragraph.

356
00:38:08,674 --> 00:38:12,144
The above report is top secret
and intended for your eyes only.

357
00:38:12,714 --> 00:38:15,148
Written at 0800 hours...

358
00:38:15,474 --> 00:38:18,784
...August 14, 1963.

359
00:38:19,834 --> 00:38:22,064
Address to the Minister of the Interior.

360
00:38:22,874 --> 00:38:25,104
Have the dispatch riderstand by...

361
00:38:25,954 --> 00:38:28,104
...and forget everything you've heard.

362
00:39:27,874 --> 00:39:29,068
Well?

363
00:39:30,474 --> 00:39:32,112
If what Rolland says is true...

364
00:39:32,194 --> 00:39:35,425
...the whole network of our agents
inside the OAS is no good to us.

365
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:43,065
The President must be told.

366
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:45,511
I'll ask for an interview.

367
00:39:46,114 --> 00:39:48,105
Get me the Élysée Palace.

368
00:40:11,114 --> 00:40:13,582
Minister. One moment, sir.

369
00:40:18,354 --> 00:40:19,912
The Minister of the lnterior.

370
00:40:32,314 --> 00:40:33,633
There you are.

371
00:40:39,234 --> 00:40:41,065
It's all there.

372
00:40:43,394 --> 00:40:47,546
The Duggan driving license
and French identity card were easy but...

373
00:40:48,194 --> 00:40:50,628
...that third card was a big headache.

374
00:40:50,754 --> 00:40:52,870
It's nicely dog-eared, isn't it?

375
00:40:54,474 --> 00:40:56,988
-Have you forgotten something?
-Sorry?

376
00:40:58,394 --> 00:41:01,511
The original driving license.
The one I said I wanted back.

377
00:41:03,234 --> 00:41:05,384
I thought we might have a chat about that.

378
00:41:10,314 --> 00:41:13,272
The fact is,
the original driving license is not here.

379
00:41:13,434 --> 00:41:16,426
But don't worry.
It's put away in a very safe place.

380
00:41:16,554 --> 00:41:19,022
Nobody can get at it but me.

381
00:41:21,234 --> 00:41:23,702
-What do you want?
-I'm coming to that.

382
00:41:23,874 --> 00:41:26,342
What I propose is simply a little trade.

383
00:41:26,434 --> 00:41:28,709
I give you the original driving license...

384
00:41:28,794 --> 00:41:31,354
...and all those negatives I took of you...

385
00:41:31,554 --> 00:41:33,226
...for a certain sum of money.

386
00:41:33,314 --> 00:41:35,669
-How much?
-A thousand pounds.

387
00:41:35,834 --> 00:41:39,713
Isn't it worth that
to get those documents back?

388
00:41:41,274 --> 00:41:43,026
Yes, I suppose so.

389
00:41:43,394 --> 00:41:46,466
An English gentleman can always
be trusted to see sense.

390
00:41:46,634 --> 00:41:50,263
I can find the first 500 by noon tomorrow,
but we don't meet here.

391
00:41:50,354 --> 00:41:52,231
There's nothing wrong with this place.

392
00:41:52,314 --> 00:41:53,986
It's very quiet and private.

393
00:41:54,074 --> 00:41:56,383
There's everything wrong with this place.

394
00:41:56,474 --> 00:42:00,672
Forget about that. Nobody comes here
unless they're invited by me.

395
00:42:00,754 --> 00:42:04,872
One has to be very discreet,
you know, in my little sideline.

396
00:43:41,354 --> 00:43:42,867
I asked for aluminium.

397
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:46,705
I tried the aluminium but it just did bend...

398
00:43:46,914 --> 00:43:49,428
...like tissue paper.
I had to use stainless steel.

399
00:43:50,114 --> 00:43:52,674
But it's all right. It looks the same.

400
00:43:52,754 --> 00:43:54,107
Where can I practice?

401
00:43:54,954 --> 00:43:58,390
There's the Montemorro Forest.
You could be there and back in a day.

402
00:43:58,634 --> 00:44:00,465
-Excuse me.
-I won't need the case.

403
00:44:01,714 --> 00:44:03,545
Silencer, please.

404
00:44:06,794 --> 00:44:08,147
Strut.

405
00:44:11,594 --> 00:44:13,505
And the sniper scope.

406
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,462
Here.

407
00:44:20,634 --> 00:44:21,953
Trigger.

408
00:44:22,474 --> 00:44:23,987
Trigger, please.

409
00:44:41,674 --> 00:44:44,142
-Beautiful piece of work.
-I know.

410
00:44:44,554 --> 00:44:46,624
-It's really excellent.
-Yes.

411
00:44:48,274 --> 00:44:52,062
These are for practice.
I took out six of them...

412
00:44:52,434 --> 00:44:54,584
...to convert to explosive tips.

413
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,832
Let me have one.

414
00:45:13,594 --> 00:45:16,313
-Good evening, gentlemen.
-Good evening.

415
00:45:16,754 --> 00:45:18,267
Please sit down.

416
00:45:19,874 --> 00:45:22,513
I trust that you've all read
Colonel Rolland's report?

417
00:45:24,314 --> 00:45:27,226
I delivered a copy
to the President this afternoon.

418
00:45:28,034 --> 00:45:31,185
Unhappily, in the interest
of the dignity of France...

419
00:45:31,274 --> 00:45:34,471
...he feels obliged to impose
enormous limitations on us.

420
00:45:34,794 --> 00:45:37,262
He refuses to alter in any way...

421
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:40,028
...the summer schedule
of his public appearances.

422
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:41,388
Good heavens.

423
00:45:41,594 --> 00:45:44,870
The search for this Jackal
will be conducted in absolute secrecy.

424
00:45:45,634 --> 00:45:48,626
Needless to say,
you are all sworn to total silence...

425
00:45:48,714 --> 00:45:51,274
...and won't discuss this matter
outside this room.

426
00:45:51,354 --> 00:45:52,753
But Minister--

427
00:45:54,314 --> 00:45:55,747
But it's impossible!

428
00:45:55,834 --> 00:45:58,473
The President was absolutely adamant.

429
00:45:59,074 --> 00:46:02,464
What extra security precautions
do we take, Minister?

430
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:03,908
None.

431
00:46:04,954 --> 00:46:07,627
General Colbert. Any success in Vienna?

432
00:46:07,714 --> 00:46:11,946
Inquiries were made by our agents
at the Pension Kleist.

433
00:46:12,114 --> 00:46:16,187
They showed photographs of Rodin,
Montclair and Casson to the desk clerk.

434
00:46:16,634 --> 00:46:20,468
Some money changed hands.
He stated that he recognized them.

435
00:46:20,554 --> 00:46:22,829
They had arrived on June 14.

436
00:46:24,074 --> 00:46:25,507
Were there any visitors?

437
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:28,025
One man the next afternoon.

438
00:46:28,274 --> 00:46:30,583
He left half an hour later.

439
00:46:31,034 --> 00:46:35,391
The only description the clerk could give
was the man was well-groomed...

440
00:46:35,474 --> 00:46:37,704
...in his early thirties and had fair hair.

441
00:46:39,154 --> 00:46:41,509
Surely a better description can be found.

442
00:46:41,594 --> 00:46:42,947
From whom?

443
00:46:45,994 --> 00:46:47,473
Rodin, for instance.

444
00:46:48,754 --> 00:46:52,827
I hardly think he'd accept an invitation
from any of our departments, Colonel.

445
00:46:58,154 --> 00:47:01,146
Commissioner Berthier, any suggestions?

446
00:47:02,114 --> 00:47:03,945
We're in trouble on this one.

447
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,429
Our agents inside the OAS
can't pin him down...

448
00:47:06,514 --> 00:47:08,948
...since not even the OAS know who he is.

449
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:12,071
Action Service can't destroy him.
They don't know who to destroy.

450
00:47:12,154 --> 00:47:16,272
Surveillance can't get him at the border,
they don't know what he looks like.

451
00:47:16,354 --> 00:47:19,187
The gendarmes, all 48,000 of them,
can't pursue him.

452
00:47:19,274 --> 00:47:20,992
They don't know who to pursue.

453
00:47:21,074 --> 00:47:24,544
The police can't arrest him.
We don't know who to arrest.

454
00:47:25,794 --> 00:47:28,752
Without a name,
all other proposals are meaningless.

455
00:47:28,874 --> 00:47:30,785
The first task, then, is to find it.

456
00:47:30,994 --> 00:47:33,986
With a name, we get a passport and a face.

457
00:47:34,114 --> 00:47:36,503
With a face, we get an arrest.

458
00:47:37,394 --> 00:47:40,784
But to find his name,
and to do it in secret...

459
00:47:40,874 --> 00:47:43,024
...is a job of pure detective work.

460
00:47:43,114 --> 00:47:46,709
Commissioner,
who is the best detective on the force?

461
00:47:49,394 --> 00:47:50,713
The best detective...

462
00:47:50,914 --> 00:47:54,031
...is my own deputy commissioner,
Claude Lebel.

463
00:47:59,114 --> 00:48:00,467
Claude!

464
00:48:04,474 --> 00:48:06,544
Berthier wants to see you.

465
00:48:07,114 --> 00:48:09,423
-What? Now?
-He's sent a car.

466
00:48:11,994 --> 00:48:14,462
Don't be back later than 9:00.

467
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:30,672
Commissioner Lebel.

468
00:48:35,034 --> 00:48:36,786
Good evening.

469
00:48:38,754 --> 00:48:41,746
Remember, you have full powers
in this investigation...

470
00:48:41,874 --> 00:48:45,913
...and the resources of every department
represented here entirely at your disposal.

471
00:48:45,994 --> 00:48:49,543
My instructions are simply:
no publicity and do not fail.

472
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,471
Keep your copy of the report.

473
00:48:53,354 --> 00:48:54,628
Any questions?

474
00:48:55,314 --> 00:48:56,508
No, Minister.

475
00:48:56,874 --> 00:48:58,944
In that case, I'll not detain you.

476
00:49:01,154 --> 00:49:02,746
Thank you, Commissioner.

477
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:11,714
Collect the reports
and put them in my private safe.

478
00:49:11,794 --> 00:49:13,193
-Yes, Minister.
-Good night.

479
00:49:13,274 --> 00:49:15,310
-Good night.
-Thank you.

480
00:49:29,354 --> 00:49:31,822
You'll have to drop whatever you're doing.

481
00:49:31,954 --> 00:49:33,467
Clear the desk completely.

482
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:35,590
-You want a new office?
-No.

483
00:49:36,074 --> 00:49:39,225
From now on, it's headquarters for this job,
nothing else.

484
00:49:39,554 --> 00:49:42,352
The Minister said
he wants a progress report by you...

485
00:49:42,434 --> 00:49:44,311
...every evening from now on.

486
00:49:44,674 --> 00:49:47,268
-Here. 10:00 sharp.
-Oh, God.

487
00:49:47,434 --> 00:49:48,628
I know.

488
00:49:48,874 --> 00:49:52,264
You've just got to find him
before he gets to De Gaulle.

489
00:49:52,394 --> 00:49:55,466
-I wonder if he has a timetable.
-I'm sure he has.

490
00:49:55,554 --> 00:49:57,272
The trouble is, only he knows it.

491
00:49:57,354 --> 00:50:00,471
He might go for a hit tomorrow
or maybe not for a month.

492
00:50:00,714 --> 00:50:03,182
You've got to work flat out
until you locate him.

493
00:50:03,274 --> 00:50:06,710
After that, we can have Action Service
do the rest, the thugs.

494
00:50:06,994 --> 00:50:10,464
Obviously, you've got to have
a heavy mug for a thing like this.

495
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:14,869
Anyway, just go and find this Jackal,
will you?

496
00:50:16,914 --> 00:50:17,790
What?

497
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:21,464
-I'll need help.
-Who?

498
00:50:21,674 --> 00:50:23,949
Young Caron, and he'll have to be told.

499
00:50:24,314 --> 00:50:28,546
-I'll have to get clearance.
-All I want is Caron. That's all.

500
00:50:34,554 --> 00:50:38,069
You know, sir, what they'll do to you
if you don't catch him in time.

501
00:50:38,794 --> 00:50:41,433
I've been given a job,
so we'll just have to do it.

502
00:50:41,514 --> 00:50:43,345
But no crime has been committed yet.

503
00:50:43,434 --> 00:50:46,187
Where are we supposed to start looking
for the criminal?

504
00:50:46,394 --> 00:50:48,749
We start by recognizing that,
after De Gaulle...

505
00:50:48,834 --> 00:50:51,189
...we are the two most
powerful people in France.

506
00:50:51,274 --> 00:50:52,787
Now make notes.

507
00:50:53,794 --> 00:50:56,467
Get my secretary transferred
until further notice.

508
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:59,705
You will be my secretary
and assistant rolled into one.

509
00:51:00,034 --> 00:51:03,265
I want a camp bed in here
with linen and all the usual...

510
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:06,352
...including something to wash in
and shaving things.

511
00:51:06,674 --> 00:51:08,824
Also, get a percolator and lots of coffee.

512
00:51:08,914 --> 00:51:11,269
-Right, sir.
-Get onto the switchboard.

513
00:51:11,834 --> 00:51:14,553
I want a good telephonist,
the best they've got.

514
00:51:14,634 --> 00:51:17,592
I need ten outside lines
open around-the-clock.

515
00:51:17,834 --> 00:51:20,143
If there's any nonsense,
refer them to Berthier.

516
00:51:20,234 --> 00:51:22,304
This job gets top priority at all times.

517
00:51:22,394 --> 00:51:24,430
Do you want anything
from them immediately?

518
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,391
A person-to-person link to the heads...

519
00:51:26,474 --> 00:51:29,147
...of the homicide divisions
of the following countries:

520
00:51:29,234 --> 00:51:32,510
Holland, Belgium, Italy, West Germany...

521
00:51:33,074 --> 00:51:34,632
...and South Africa.

522
00:51:34,714 --> 00:51:36,386
The FBl in the United States...

523
00:51:36,474 --> 00:51:38,863
...and Scotland Yard's
Special Branch in Britain.

524
00:51:38,954 --> 00:51:41,343
-How many is that?
-Seven.

525
00:51:41,514 --> 00:51:43,869
Get the head man at home or in the office.

526
00:51:43,954 --> 00:51:46,422
Ask them to take a call from me
tomorrow morning...

527
00:51:46,514 --> 00:51:48,664
...and see that there's no one listening in.

528
00:51:48,754 --> 00:51:51,314
In the meantime,
I'm going down to General Records...

529
00:51:51,394 --> 00:51:54,352
...to check if this Jackal
has ever operated inside France.

530
00:51:54,554 --> 00:51:58,467
Sir, how do you know the Jackal
comes from any of these countries?

531
00:51:58,874 --> 00:51:59,909
I don't.

532
00:52:00,514 --> 00:52:02,982
But he must be on file somewhere.

533
00:52:21,554 --> 00:52:25,388
-Sorry I'm late, darling.
-What kept you so long?

534
00:52:25,514 --> 00:52:29,189
-There was a long meeting.
-I've been waiting for hours.

535
00:52:29,474 --> 00:52:32,705
Yes, I'm sorry about the hour, but....

536
00:52:33,554 --> 00:52:36,944
Yes, Washington, I know it's 7:00 there.
It's midnight here.

537
00:52:38,354 --> 00:52:39,309
What?

538
00:52:40,834 --> 00:52:43,473
Could you call him at the club, please?

539
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:46,113
I didn't go out.

540
00:52:46,354 --> 00:52:48,504
I just sat waiting for you to call.

541
00:52:48,594 --> 00:52:50,744
It was impossible. There was a crisis on.

542
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,223
Crisis? What crisis?

543
00:52:53,834 --> 00:52:55,187
Never mind.

544
00:53:01,074 --> 00:53:03,429
-What crisis?
-It was nothing.

545
00:53:05,354 --> 00:53:06,867
What crisis?

546
00:53:11,754 --> 00:53:12,982
Mr. Mallinson.

547
00:53:13,394 --> 00:53:17,433
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.
It's Paris calling, Inspector Caron.

548
00:53:17,514 --> 00:53:20,153
I don't wish to sound rude,
but wouldn't it be better...

549
00:53:20,234 --> 00:53:23,863
...if routine inquiries could be conducted
through proper channels?

550
00:53:24,114 --> 00:53:25,752
Preferably when we're all awake?

551
00:53:26,674 --> 00:53:30,144
I'm sorry, Mr. Mallinson. It is very urgent.

552
00:53:30,314 --> 00:53:32,953
Commissioner Lebel didn't wish
to make a formal request.

553
00:53:33,034 --> 00:53:35,753
He was hoping
that you'd cooperate with us unofficially.

554
00:53:36,194 --> 00:53:39,869
All right.
I'll take the Commissioner's call at 8:30.

555
00:53:40,354 --> 00:53:42,231
Fine. Good night.

556
00:53:43,834 --> 00:53:45,187
What's left of it.

557
00:53:45,394 --> 00:53:48,192
-Who was that?
-The old boy network.

558
00:54:39,474 --> 00:54:40,543
Yes?

559
00:54:40,914 --> 00:54:43,109
-Denise.
-Valmy here.

560
00:54:43,554 --> 00:54:45,545
They found out about the Jackal.

561
00:54:49,434 --> 00:54:53,586
All I found in Central Records was that
in the 10 last years there've only been...

562
00:54:53,674 --> 00:54:55,710
...four contract killers in France.

563
00:54:55,794 --> 00:54:59,548
We've got three. The fourth is
serving time in Africa somewhere.

564
00:54:59,674 --> 00:55:01,983
So, our man must be from abroad.

565
00:55:02,234 --> 00:55:05,226
Surely he's come to someone's attention
somewhere.

566
00:55:07,274 --> 00:55:09,834
-Who do I speak to first?
-Scotland Yard...

567
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:12,073
...Special Branch.

568
00:55:12,594 --> 00:55:14,664
Assistant Commissioner Mallinson.

569
00:55:16,234 --> 00:55:19,544
There's no name.
Nothing to go on, l'm afraid.

570
00:55:22,554 --> 00:55:25,944
It's pretty irregular,
all this unofficial secrecy, isn't it?

571
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:27,712
Makes my task difficult.

572
00:55:28,114 --> 00:55:29,388
Yes, I know.

573
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:33,666
I've never heard of a political killer
in this country.

574
00:55:33,874 --> 00:55:37,469
-It's not our style, is it?
-No, it's more your department...

575
00:55:38,074 --> 00:55:40,144
-...so, I'll leave it in your hands.
-Yes--

576
00:55:40,234 --> 00:55:42,794
And try to get it out of the way
by tomorrow.

577
00:55:43,034 --> 00:55:44,786
I'm understaffed as it is.

578
00:55:45,354 --> 00:55:46,992
Yes, sir.

579
00:55:51,194 --> 00:55:52,752
What's the cost?

580
00:59:02,154 --> 00:59:04,668
Give me the Foreign Office,
would you, please, luv?

581
00:59:04,754 --> 00:59:06,472
Extension 905.

582
00:59:11,994 --> 00:59:13,222
Hello, Barrie?

583
00:59:13,954 --> 00:59:15,148
Brian Thomas.

584
00:59:15,354 --> 00:59:18,426
Could you meet me in an hour
at the usual place?

585
00:59:25,314 --> 00:59:28,147
We've been plowing through the files
till we're cross-eyed.

586
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:30,111
None of them fits the description.

587
00:59:30,194 --> 00:59:32,264
But before we drop it, I had a thought.

588
00:59:32,554 --> 00:59:34,909
If this contract killer
did all his work abroad...

589
00:59:34,994 --> 00:59:37,269
...he'd be quite respectable
in England, right?

590
00:59:37,354 --> 00:59:38,104
So?

591
00:59:38,394 --> 00:59:42,546
Your people operate abroad. I thought
you might have tabs on a bloke like that.

592
00:59:42,634 --> 00:59:44,465
I'll have a look.

593
00:59:46,474 --> 00:59:48,271
Brian, call for you.

594
00:59:55,154 --> 00:59:56,109
Thomas.

595
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,033
Yes, that's right.

596
01:00:00,514 --> 01:00:02,584
Is this some sort of bloody joke?

597
01:00:04,794 --> 01:00:06,307
What, now?

598
01:00:07,554 --> 01:00:08,623
Personally?

599
01:00:09,714 --> 01:00:11,306
Yes, I'll--

600
01:00:34,434 --> 01:00:36,994
-The Prime Minister?
-The Prime Minister, sir.

601
01:00:37,234 --> 01:00:41,227
He said, "lf there's the remotest chance
of De Gaulle's life being threatened...

602
01:00:41,314 --> 01:00:44,465
...by a person of these islands,
then it is to be stopped."

603
01:00:44,554 --> 01:00:47,273
He's given me full powers and top priority.

604
01:00:47,794 --> 01:00:50,103
-Is this some kind of joke?
-Of course not, sir.

605
01:00:50,194 --> 01:00:52,310
I've got to drop whatever I'm doing.

606
01:00:52,394 --> 01:00:55,227
I shall need six of your best men
straight away.

607
01:00:56,834 --> 01:01:00,304
Where's the notification for this?
Where's the proper authority?

608
01:01:01,794 --> 01:01:02,988
Yes!

609
01:01:07,674 --> 01:01:09,710
Yes, sir. Of course, sir.

610
01:01:16,354 --> 01:01:19,824
Nothing more than taproom gossip,
I'm afraid.

611
01:01:20,354 --> 01:01:22,106
Do you remember Trujillo?

612
01:01:23,034 --> 01:01:26,106
You mean the dictator
of some republic in South America?

613
01:01:26,234 --> 01:01:28,873
Yes, Dominica. He was killed in 1961.

614
01:01:29,274 --> 01:01:32,983
We got word that an Englishman
may have been mixed up in it.

615
01:01:33,354 --> 01:01:35,584
Just an unconfirmed report, mind you.

616
01:01:35,874 --> 01:01:39,150
-Did he have a name?
-Charles Harold Calthrop.

617
01:01:39,594 --> 01:01:43,143
He was the Caribbean rep
for a small armaments firm.

618
01:01:43,674 --> 01:01:46,871
According to the rumor,
he was a fantastic shot.

619
01:01:47,834 --> 01:01:50,189
He disappeared after the assassination.

620
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:52,392
Nobody knows where he went.

621
01:01:53,314 --> 01:01:54,349
Calthrop.

622
01:01:54,474 --> 01:01:56,942
-Is that all there is to go on?
-Afraid so.

623
01:01:57,514 --> 01:01:58,788
Just a name?

624
01:02:01,594 --> 01:02:03,550
What makes you think it might be him?

625
01:02:03,634 --> 01:02:06,831
Your friend's code name is "Jackal", right?

626
01:02:07,234 --> 01:02:08,792
Jackal in French is...

627
01:02:09,234 --> 01:02:11,873
..."chacal."

628
01:02:12,514 --> 01:02:13,344
See?

629
01:02:13,514 --> 01:02:15,584
Now it might just be a coincidence...

630
01:02:15,674 --> 01:02:18,825
...but the first three letters
of his Christian name, Charles...

631
01:02:18,914 --> 01:02:22,429
...and the first three letters
of Calthrop make up....

632
01:02:36,954 --> 01:02:40,105
That's all the Charles H. Calthrop,
way back to 1958.

633
01:02:40,274 --> 01:02:42,105
-How many does that make?
-23.

634
01:02:46,194 --> 01:02:48,310
Will you please tell Commissioner Lebel...

635
01:02:48,394 --> 01:02:51,272
...that there is a faint possibility,
very faint...

636
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:54,910
...the name is Charles Harold Calthrop.

637
01:02:55,834 --> 01:02:58,428
That's right.
We've checked with the Passport Office.

638
01:02:58,514 --> 01:03:01,312
23 passports were issued
to Charles H. Calthrop...

639
01:03:01,514 --> 01:03:03,425
...during the past five years.

640
01:03:03,674 --> 01:03:05,904
We've interviewed 12 of them so far.

641
01:03:06,834 --> 01:03:09,473
Nothing at all, but I'll keep you posted.

642
01:03:09,954 --> 01:03:11,865
Do you have a garage for rent?

643
01:05:00,714 --> 01:05:02,113
Excuse me.

644
01:05:02,354 --> 01:05:04,948
Would you happen to know
where Mr. Charles Calthrop is?

645
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:06,353
-Mr. Calthrop?
-Yes.

646
01:05:06,794 --> 01:05:09,547
I think he's abroad. He often is, you know.

647
01:05:10,394 --> 01:05:11,429
Thank you.

648
01:05:11,994 --> 01:05:13,950
We better get a search warrant.

649
01:05:29,874 --> 01:05:31,387
What's happening?

650
01:05:39,754 --> 01:05:40,869
Come in.

651
01:05:43,274 --> 01:05:46,266
We've been through the lot, sir.
He's away, all right.

652
01:05:47,874 --> 01:05:49,592
Let's see what you've got.

653
01:06:08,154 --> 01:06:10,145
-What's this?
-His passport.

654
01:06:10,994 --> 01:06:12,666
We checked it. It's him.

655
01:06:12,874 --> 01:06:15,513
Look. The Dominican visa.

656
01:06:16,234 --> 01:06:19,624
There's no exit stamp though.
He must have got out on the sly.

657
01:06:20,554 --> 01:06:22,943
You haven't grasped it yet, have you?

658
01:06:23,234 --> 01:06:25,828
Yes, this is our man, all right. Definitely.

659
01:06:25,914 --> 01:06:29,304
But hasn't it occurred to you
that we're holding his passport?

660
01:06:29,954 --> 01:06:33,151
If he is out of the country,
what's he traveling on?

661
01:06:34,794 --> 01:06:37,592
-He might be on holiday in the UK.
-Yes, he might.

662
01:06:37,714 --> 01:06:39,386
Then again, he might not.

663
01:06:39,794 --> 01:06:43,389
His name is Charles Harold Calthrop.
Here's his passport photo.

664
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:48,871
I'll circulate photos
to each of you after the meeting.

665
01:06:49,434 --> 01:06:50,503
Excellent.

666
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:53,112
Thank you, Commissioner.

667
01:06:55,154 --> 01:07:00,103
It may be Calthrop has already entered
the country and is staying at a hotel.

668
01:07:00,194 --> 01:07:01,422
-Phillison.
-Minister?

669
01:07:01,514 --> 01:07:04,950
I want every hotel card for the past
72 hours checked by the police.

670
01:07:05,034 --> 01:07:09,152
The same for you, Pascal, with those cards
that are filed for the greater Paris area.

671
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:12,306
Circulate to your staffs
this man's name and photograph.

672
01:07:12,394 --> 01:07:16,182
He must be arrested on sight,
and my office notified at once.

673
01:07:16,794 --> 01:07:18,352
I want every border post...

674
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:21,267
...airport, seaport, fishing village alerted.

675
01:07:21,994 --> 01:07:24,110
-General Colbert.
-Minister?

676
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:27,864
Calthrop is probably still abroad,
so get your agents working on that.

677
01:07:27,954 --> 01:07:28,750
Yes, sir.

678
01:07:28,994 --> 01:07:31,588
In the meantime,
complete silence must be maintained...

679
01:07:31,674 --> 01:07:34,234
...until we're sure
the man's in this country.

680
01:07:34,314 --> 01:07:37,192
-Thank you. Good night.
-Good night.

681
01:07:45,434 --> 01:07:47,265
Commissioner Lebel's office.

682
01:07:49,314 --> 01:07:50,508
Yes.

683
01:07:55,114 --> 01:07:56,991
Thank you. Good-bye.

684
01:07:59,794 --> 01:08:03,184
No one called Calthrop has crossed
any border point legally...

685
01:08:03,274 --> 01:08:05,105
...since the start of the year.

686
01:08:05,194 --> 01:08:07,867
And no hotel has taken in a guest
under that name.

687
01:08:07,954 --> 01:08:10,343
Maybe he's given up and gone into hiding.

688
01:08:11,874 --> 01:08:14,468
If the British found
Calthrop's passport in his flat...

689
01:08:14,554 --> 01:08:16,863
...it's because he no longer needed it.

690
01:08:17,714 --> 01:08:20,069
Don't count on that man
making too many errors.

691
01:08:20,154 --> 01:08:21,667
He's not the type.

692
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:26,948
I'm beginning to get
a feeling about the Jackal.

693
01:08:28,514 --> 01:08:31,312
He may be abroad,
traveling on a false passport.

694
01:08:32,234 --> 01:08:35,624
What you're going to do now is
go down to the Passport Office.

695
01:08:35,954 --> 01:08:39,469
Get every passport application
for the last three months.

696
01:08:39,554 --> 01:08:41,704
-But, sir--
-I don't care who's closed.

697
01:08:41,794 --> 01:08:43,273
Wake the buggers up.

698
01:08:43,874 --> 01:08:46,752
Then take all those papers
down to Somerset House...

699
01:08:46,954 --> 01:08:49,422
...get started on checking
the applicants' names...

700
01:08:49,514 --> 01:08:52,506
...against death certificates,
not birth certificates.

701
01:08:52,874 --> 01:08:56,469
If you find an application filed by someone
who died as a child...

702
01:08:56,554 --> 01:08:58,988
...the one who filed it might be our man.

703
01:08:59,914 --> 01:09:02,826
If you find nothing
in the first three months, go back three.

704
01:09:02,914 --> 01:09:04,711
And another three if you have to.

705
01:09:04,794 --> 01:09:06,147
Off you go.

706
01:09:42,914 --> 01:09:43,869
Yes?

707
01:09:44,354 --> 01:09:45,946
How's it going, Hughes?

708
01:09:47,914 --> 01:09:49,472
How many applications?

709
01:09:50,234 --> 01:09:52,190
8,041?

710
01:09:52,914 --> 01:09:54,552
You'll be there a week.

711
01:09:54,914 --> 01:09:57,144
How about I send you some more staff?

712
01:09:59,394 --> 01:10:01,112
Bloody holiday season.

713
01:10:09,034 --> 01:10:11,628
About 4,000 more to go, Mr. Thomas.

714
01:10:12,674 --> 01:10:15,984
But if we work through lunch,
we should be finished tonight.

715
01:10:55,754 --> 01:10:57,984
Superintendent Thomas, Special Branch.

716
01:10:59,754 --> 01:11:01,107
Hughes here, sir.

717
01:11:02,114 --> 01:11:03,752
Paul Oliver Duggan.

718
01:11:03,834 --> 01:11:07,190
Born April 3, 1929, in Sambourne Fishley.

719
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:09,584
Applied for passport July 14 of this year.

720
01:11:09,674 --> 01:11:12,905
Passport mailed July 17
to an address in Paddington.

721
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:16,625
That will probably turn out
to be an accommodation address.

722
01:11:16,994 --> 01:11:17,949
Why?

723
01:11:18,154 --> 01:11:23,308
Because Duggan died at the age
of two and a half on November 8, 1931.

724
01:11:56,994 --> 01:11:58,507
Passport, please.
