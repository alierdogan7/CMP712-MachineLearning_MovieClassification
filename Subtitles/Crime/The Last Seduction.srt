1
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,000
I expect to see that on your income tax Marty.
I can't hear you people!

2
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,200
You maggots sound like suburbanites.

3
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,840
Fifty bucks for a lousy coin set,
you sell one at a time?

4
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,480
And a hundred bucks for the next
sucker who makes a triple sale.

5
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,840
A minute 50 seconds Bernie.
D'you expect these leads to grow on fucking trees ?

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,080
Want me over your shoulder all day Bernie, huh?

7
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,840
Ask for the sale four times every time, got it?

8
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,280
You got twenty seconds to close it, Bernie.

9
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,360
Fifteen...
I'm on your tail, Bernie.

10
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,040
Five... Four...

...at a price that would be stupid to pass up.
11
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,400
You'd have to be brain dead. Yeah. How many sets do you want?

12
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,720
- You got the shit, man?
- Yep.

13
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,000
Hey, well give it up, bro.

14
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,120
As ordered.
Pharmaceutical cocaine.

15
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,760
Come on you eunuchs!
Zeke's closing his suckers six, seven times,

16
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,400
and he's got twice as many sales as the rest of you bastards.

17
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,480
You'll spend your Sunday here too
if you don't take these bills from me.

18
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,480
Oh, shit.

19
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,920
Of course, of course.

20
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,960
What a stupid mistake.
Go ahead!

21
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,600
Ah, we have a winner. Jerry...
Who'd have thought? What'll it be, Jer?

22
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,560
Hundred bucks, or a thousand dollars
worth of rare commemorative coins? Hmm?

23
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,040
You think I'm from Jersey?

24
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,680
Wise man.

25
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,160
Ah, christ; a charmed life.

26
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,560
Go on! Go on!

27
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,560
Clay ?

28
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Bridget, it's me. They moved it back.
I'll be home when I can.

29
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,440
People saw flames shooting from the building, called the fire department.
By the time the engine got here it was too late,

30
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,920
and there were five dead young people.

31
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,840
How'd it go?

32
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,160
Did you get the money?

33
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,880
Did you?

34
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,480
You walk the streets like that?

35
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,960
You're an idiot.

36
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,640
Bridget, I didn't mean that.

37
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,920
Hey, I'm still hung up honey.
These are very scary people.

38
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,880
Forgive me. Hmm?

39
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,840
I'll make it up to you.

40
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,120
You can hit me. Anywhere. Hard.

41
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,520
Oh, baby, baby, baby - let's not fight, right?

42
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,320
This is our penthouse.
This is the key to the real city.

43
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,320
This is what you wanted.
This is what we've been working for.

44
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Seven hundred thousand.

45
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,120
This was a mistake.

46
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,480
This is just to take care of us during our residency

47
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,840
until the Doctor bucks start rolling in, right?

48
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,560
They're soft.
I thought they'd be stiff.

49
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,880
These are laundered! Untraceable.
Perfectly safe, right?

50
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,080
We have to put them somewhere.

51
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,680
You are a criminal mastermind!

52
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,320
It's just a hobby.

53
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,080
I wanna pay off that loan shark first thing
tomorrow morning.

54
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,880
Oh, maybe he'll forget.

55
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,880
A hundred grand plus interest?
I doubt it.

56
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,200
Stop.

57
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,480
You gotta give a little love.

58
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,880
Somethin' wrong?

59
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,480
Fear.

60
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,840
I'm gonna take a long hot one and then
you and I are gonna celebrate.

61
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,760
Worth the risk, huh?

62
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,520
What do you wanna do tonight?

63
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,400
Go to the opera,
or some kinda big Broadway show?

64
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,520
Fine dining experience?

65
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,600
Whatever you want.

66
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,360
Hey Bridge, do we have any shampoo?

67
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,320
How are we supposed to celebrate?

68
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,720
Hey, Bridge?

69
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,760
Bridget!

70
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,320
You better run!

71
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,000

72
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,520

73
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,960
Where the fuck am I?

74
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,400
Beston.

75
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,200
How far is Chicago?

76
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,240
Oh, ten, twelve hours.
Depends on how fast you drive.

77
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,480
What's that bar like?

78
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,200
Hey, thanks a lot Mike.

79
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,120
- What, did Clarence make you beg?
- I made him beg.

80
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,000
So why all the attitude?

81
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,920
I guess Mike didn't want his job back.

82
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,120
I just didn't want to come back to this dead end town, that's all.

83
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,640
So you, you wanna talk about it or...?

84
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,320
There's nothing to talk about.
I went to Buffalo, it didn't work out. I'm back.

85
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,640
We already know all that.

86
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,360
- I guess he didn't want to talk about it.
- I guess not.

87
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,480
Hi guys.

88
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,880
Hi, Mike.

89
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,480
Hi Stacy. How are you?

90
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,200
- Good, you?
- Good.

91
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,320
Hi Stacy. How are you?

92
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,840
Grow up!

93
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,200
What? Did you leave your dick in Buffalo?

94
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,000
Chris, these women are anchors.

95
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:24,960
They're what?

96
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,000
They're planted here. You get too close to one,
Beston's got you for life.

97
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,480
Yeah, yeah. Here he goes again.

98
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,800
How many guys in this bar have felt her up?

99
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,200
All of 'em.

100
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,160
And how many have gone home with her - how many have slept with her?

101
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,200
None, including yourself.

102
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,040
Right. I rest my case.

103
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,320
Don't rest it too long 'cos I promise you it'll fall off.

104
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,480
How do I look, do I look alright?
Do you like this?

105
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,600
You look great.

106
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,040
Hey, Stacy.

107
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,960
- Hey, Chris.
- How you doin'?

108
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,400
- So, er, tell me about the wife.
- What ?

109
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,840
The wife, man.
Copper wedding band.

110
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,400
- Was it a kind of spur-of-the-moment decision or what?
- I can't get this off.

111
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,480
Use a little octane man, take care of it.

112
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,440
- I just never took you as the impulsive type.
- Neither did I.

113
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,400
Did you divorce her?

114
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,640
I'll get around to it.

115
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,560
I cannot spend the rest of my life here.

116
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,760
I know what's gonna happen each and every day.

117
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,520
So when do you leave?

118
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,640
How long does it take to grow a new set of balls?

119
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,200
Gimme a Manhattan.

120
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,480
I know you hear me, pal.

121
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,040
Anybody need anything down here?
Everybody good?

122
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,720
Jesus Christ. Who's a girl gotta suck around here to get a drink?

123
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,520
City trash, right? You don't take that?

124
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,720
What do you see in her?

125
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,400
Maybe a new set of balls.

126
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,280
- Gimme a Manhattan!
- Ray, a Manhattan for the lady please.

127
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,400
Sure, Mike.

128
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,360
What - that's the game? I gotta say please?

129
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,960
Er, yes, it helps.
You're not from around here?

130
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,520
Fuck off.

131
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,960
- Two dollars, please.
- I got it Ray.

132
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,240
Thanks, Mike.

133
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,760
I er, I took care of that for you.

134
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,840
"Thankyou" can also be very effective.

135
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,400
Could you leave?

136
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,400
Please.

137
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,200
Well I haven't finished charming you yet.

138
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,680
- You haven't started.
- Give me a chance.

139
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,800
Go find yourself a nice little cow-girl, make nice little cow-babies and leave me alone.

140
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,200
I'm er, I'm hung like a horse.
Think about it.

141
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,240
Let's see.

142
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,680
- Excuse me?
- Mister Ed, let's see.

143
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,680
- Look, I tried to be nice.
I can see that something in...

144
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,760
I can be very nice when I try.

145
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,280
Sit down.

146
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,400
Maybe we just got off to a bad start.
I know Ray's put plenty of people in...

147
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,160
What are you... What are you doing?

148
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,440
I believe what we're looking for has a certain horse-like quality.

149
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,680
- Are you serious?
- Never buy anything sight-unseen.

150
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,720
Uh-huh. That's a good policy.

151
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,520
How many lovers?

152
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,960
- What? Do I get extra credit points for experience?
- How many lovers?

153
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,640
Thirteen... Tw-tw-Twelve.

154
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,560
- Any prostitutes?
- No.

155
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,160
- Any men?
- No. No men.

156
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,280
- Am I approved?
- Medically.

157
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,760
- You have your own place?
- Yes.

158
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,480
- Is it a sty?
- No, it's clean.

159
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,760
Do you have indoor plumbing?

160
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,400
Yes, I have indoor plumbing, I have electricity and I have a name.

161
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,600
No names.
Meet me outside.

162
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,720
Frank Griffith please.

163
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,600
Hi.

164
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,480
It's a local call.

165
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,040
It's personal.

166
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,940
Bridget.

167
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,720
- Always a pleasure.
- You still a lawyer Frank?

168
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,080
Yeah, you still a self-serving bitch?

169
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,040
A friend needs advice.
I'll set it up for you:

170
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,420
A husband and wife do a one-time drug deal - the goal's a wholesome one.

171
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
College fund for the kids?

172
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,040
No. The wife wants new digs.
Comes off without a hitch,

173
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,360
only the wife decides that the new house would be happier without the husband.

174
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,380
Sharing was never her speciality.

175
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,920
She's anxious to start spending.

176
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,560
Well, it's just an opinion since you're not paying for it,

177
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,440
but the husband is entitled to half of
whatever you buy with that cash,

178
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,840
in fact as soon as you turn it into a legal asset 
like a condo or a house or a bank account

179
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,480
he can make a claim on it.

180
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,640
What are you saying?

181
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,480
My lips moving too fast for you?

182
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,920
Not fast enough, as I recall.

183
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,720
Now, now! Keep it in cash.

184
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,800
He's not gonna ask a judge for half of that unless he wants
to spend 20 years in Attica with somebody's dick up his ass.

185
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,280
So, what - hold onto it for how long?

186
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,600
Well, as long as it takes to er, finalise the divorce.

187
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,520
How long does that take?

188
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,400
He'll fight it - maybe 2 years.
Less if you're lucky.

189
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,240
Jesus, Frank.

190
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,040
Well I'm sorry the law doesn't make it more convenient for
you to steal and deal drugs, Bridget!

191
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,040
OK, start the divorce.

192
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,760
Well that's gonna cost you - it's a lot of paperwork.

193
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fill in the blanks for me - I'm out of town.

194
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,080
Where are you?

195
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,560
Maybury.

196
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,480
I'm going to Chicago to see an old friend.

197
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,000
Well that is the first place Clay'd expect you to go.
Stay put.

198
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,000
You can't be serious?

199
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,880
Look, maybe he won't stall.
Can he afford a good lawyer?

200
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,200
Not any more.

201
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,000
How silly of me to ask! Bye.

202
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,680

203
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,320
Hey, wait up!

204
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,440
Hey, where you going?

205
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,400
Morning.

206
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,600
Morning.

207
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,280
Morning! Beautiful day, isn't it?

208
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,920
Now boys, slow down!
Wait for me.

209
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,320

210
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,400
I can't believe our good fortune.

211
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,960
The fella we were about to go with
wasn't half as qualified.

212
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,880
Oh, you also have to sign here.

213
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,920
Nice trick.

214
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,320
I erm, I still have one concern.

215
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,480
I'll handle your records personally.

216
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,600
No-one else in the company will know you as Bridget Gregory.

217
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,800
So there's no way your husband can find you.

218
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,520
I appreciate it, Bob.

219
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,960
He actually beat you?

220
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,920
Savagely.

221
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,560
That's horrible.

222
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,280
Well. Have you decided what we'll be calling you?

223
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,200
Erm... Kroy. Wen-dy.

224
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,520
- Wendy Kroy.
- Good.

225
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,160
With a K.

226
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,560
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

227
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,840
- I work here! What are you doing here?
- You don't know me.

228
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,680
I've been thinking about you all day.
I can't believe you're here. What are you doing?

229
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,520
What are you doing here?

230
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,920
Look.

231
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,120
If I knew I was gonna be staying in this town
I would have had nothing to do with you.

232
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,640
Well I'm very flattered! Thank you.

233
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,920
As far as I'm concerned any sex we had 
was just a product of your imagination.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

234
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,560
Well I happen to have evidence to the contrary.

235
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,400
What kind of evidence?

236
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,760
The unrolled latex kind of evidence.

237
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,480
That's disgusting.

238
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,200
I work here now.
Don't fuck with my image!

239
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,840
- Frank. It's me. I took your advice.
- What advice?

240
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,160
I live here. I work here.
I signed a six-month contract.

241
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,080
You're gonna be there longer than that.

242
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,040
I'm an optimist.
Let me give you the address.

243
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,400
No! I don't wanna know where you are.
I'll tell you who does, though...

244
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,720
He's called three times since he got the paperwork.
Something about a loan shark and his thumb.

245
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,440
Anybody check you for a heartbeat lately?

246
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,240
So... What am I supposed to do?

247
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,160
Send him some cash.

248
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,040
Failing that?

249
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,840
Tell him to quit calling me. 
I don't need this.

250
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,280
Alright, I'll call him.

251
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,320
Be careful - he might trace it.

252
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,720
He's not that clever.

253
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,440
- Whatever you say.
- Bye.

254
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,560
This is the operator. I have a person-to-person
call Bridget to Clay. Will you accept the charge?

255
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,520
Is this Bridget in Chicago or Bridget in Dallas?

256
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,720
Operator, disconnect this call.

257
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,240
Son of a bitch.

258
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,960
Manhattan... Please... Thankyou.

259
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,840
Well, hello again!

260
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,840
Aren't there any other bars in this town?

261
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,440
Well it's very nice to see you too.

262
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,480
I've been looking all over for you.

263
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,920
Oh good.

264
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,920
It's strange though.
None of the other secretaries

265
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,440
seem to know who you are.

266
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,120
I'm not a secretary you rural neanderthal.
I'm...

267
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,160
Director of Lead Generation.
I'm just trying to get your attention.

268
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,280
That's good.

269
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,040
Don't move.

270
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,040
You're living here now or what?

271
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,320
- For the time being.
- Yeah? Where do I fit in?

272
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,160
Ah, you're my designated fuck.

273
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,280
Designated fuck?

274
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,600
Do they make cards for that?
What if I wanna be more than your designated fuck?

275
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,640
I'll designate someone else.

276
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,600
Hey, How about us going out on 
an actual date some time, you know?

277
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,960
Why?

278
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,600
Where you from?

279
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,480
A galaxy far, far away!

280
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:24,200
I'm just trying to decide whether
you're a total bitch or not.

281
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:29,280
I'm a total fucking bitch!

282
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,280
I'm having more and more trouble with this, Wendy.

283
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,600
Don't worry - you'll get the hang of it.

284
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,960
I mean you're keeping me at arm's length all the time,
I'm starting to feel like some kind of a...

285
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,080
- Sex object?
- Yes, exactly - a sex object.

286
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,520
Live it up.

287
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,040
Why don't you just stay over?

288
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,120
Gotta get back.

289
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,400
Well then I could come over. That's fine.

290
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,800
My place, my space Mike. Don't get sticky.

291
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,600
What are you so scared of, huh?
What are you so scared of?

292
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:23,880
I don't know. I...

293
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,320
I guess it's because I've been hurt before.

294
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,520
I just... I don't wanna get close to anyone
right now.

295
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,920
You're different than the others Mike.
I feel like maybe I could love you.

296
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,360
I just... I don't want that to happen. Really.

297
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,640
Will that do?

298
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,920
Fucking doesn't have to be anything more than fucking.

299
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,760
I'm... I'm not asking for love, alright?

300
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,320
Wise man.

301
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,560
We could talk. You could talk to me.
I'd like to talk!

302
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,520
So talk!

303
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,240
Who's listening!

304
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,000
There are things I'd like to know about you Wendy.
I like you.

305
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,920
I would like to know things about you.

306
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,760
Alright, look - you know my name.

307
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,720
Yes.

308
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,440
- I come from...
- New York City.

309
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,160
- How do you know that?
- My phone bill.

310
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,200
Shit.

311
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,120
Look, I like my privacy, OK?

312
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,760
- Let me in.
- No.

313
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,880
Please!

314
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,000
Then screw you!

315
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,000
Right. Tomorrow night. 8 O'clock.

316
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,520
I gotta get outta here.

317
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,840
It's me.

318
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,400
Bridget, so glad you called.

319
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,240
You know the phone booth down the block?

320
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,120
Get the number. I'll call you back.

321
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,520
But before you do that I think may...

322
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,200
I won't let you trace this Clay. Run!

323
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,680
Lay it on man, lay it on me! Come on!

324
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,280
You're beautiful.

325
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,640
Let it ring.

326
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,600
OK, here we go.

327
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,200
What's the number?

328
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,720
555-5163.

329
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,600
I'll call you right back. It'll be ringing.

330
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,720
You're on, Doc.

331
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,840
Bridge. Where are you?

332
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,520
You need to get back to New York.
It sounds quiet.

333
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,200
Yes. Why don't you come back?

334
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,360
All is forgiven Clay? I don't buy it.

335
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,760
- Give me the money back.
- It's mine. You hit me.

336
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,280
- I slapped you.
- It's mine.

337
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:37,040
Listen, forget about this 'possession is
90% of the law' crap. 

338
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,800
The hundred grand that we borrowed is
a hundred and fifty now and the 

339
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,600
private detective from upstairs

340
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,320
has a 50% contingency on the rest,

341
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,880
and he wants it very, very bad.

342
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,040
Alright, look. I'll pay off the shark,
throw 10 more to your private detective.

343
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,400
Give me a divorce, we'll be even.

344
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,120
You qualify, you're a bitch!

345
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,800
Think Clay - it's the best you can hope for.

346
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,080
I thought you were...

347
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,960
Did you get anything? Anything at all?

348
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,400
Area code.

349
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,120
What city?

350
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,280
City?

351
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,480
She's in cow country.

352
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,720
- Frank Griffith's office.
- Is he there? It's Bridget.

353
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,880
- He's on another line.
- I don't care if he's on the other line. This is urgent.

354
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,040
I have other clients, Bridget.

355
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,800
I think he traced my call.
I'm outta here.

356
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,920
Ah, just relax.
How long were you on the phone?

357
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,000
- 45 seconds, maybe less.
- Yeah, well that's not enough time.

358
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,760
It's enough time to pinpoint the region.
Area code maybe.

359
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,520
- Yeah, well time for a new area code.
- Well, most fugitives are caught on the run Bridge.

360
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,120
Frank, don't do this to me.

361
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,560
There are 10 million phone numbers per
area code. You got an alias?

362
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,440
Well then just relax.

363
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,040
Are you sure?

364
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,640
Yeah, and look, if you're nervous
about staying alone - don't.

365
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,320
- I hope you're right.
- Bye.

366
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,560

367
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,680
Wendy, I'm sorry

368
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,120
I walked in on you in the bathroom, I really am.
What you walking so fast for?

369
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,600
A woman loses 50% of her authority when
people find out who she's sleeping with.

370
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,360
- That's a crock.
- It's a university study.

371
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,200
Great. Listen. This place is not like that OK.
Around here we're not like that.

372
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,560
Time to shut up!

373
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,200
Get your hands off me!
What's your problem, Mister?

374
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,000
What is this - the corporate dark ages?
Did you see that?

375
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,360
What are you saying?

376
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,720
I'm saying I don't have anything more to go on.

377
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,760
Damn.

378
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,160
Hey. That's my retail business.
Like I got a choice.

379
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,560
I don't like being around this.

380
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,720
- Who is it?
- I'm here to see the Doctor.

381
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,680
Nice place.

382
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,880
What can I do for you?

383
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,000
I need to lose some weight.
I mean, gotta go on a diet.

384
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,840
Well, ThinFast.

385
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,000
ThinFast.

386
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,760
- What about it?
- You tried it, you asshole!

387
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,320
Oh, right. Didn't work.

388
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,800
I think you'll like this.

389
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,520
Charming business.

390
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,480
Hey, it's just trying to keep up with the interest.
Now, you were saying?

391
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,200
I got no more to go on.

392
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,040
What - you aren't quittin' on me are you?

393
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:25,320
Well you're not payin' my expenses.
I can't afford to go around half the state
carrying her picture, man.

394
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,720
The name Bridget Gregory is ringin'
no bells up there.

395
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,520
- Maybe she changed her name.
- Maybe definitely.

396
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,120
Unless you figure out what she changed it to
we got nothin'.

397
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,160
She wants back here. She wants it bad.

398
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,120
She probably is back here.
Now why don't you tell your friends to watch out for her?

399
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,760
If you find her, I'd be glad to separate
her from the cash.

400
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,240
Hey man, you've been big.

401
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,760
You really want to stop it with that.

402
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,360
Harlan !

403
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,520
Wendy Kroy.

404
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,480
It's her name
It's the one she's using now.

405
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,800
You're flailing, man.

406
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,600
No, no, no. I know her.

407
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,360
She's got this crazy talent

408
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,960
where she can write backwards.

409
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,760
New York. Backwards.

410
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,760
The city.

411
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,520
It's all she's thinking about.

412
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,200
Wendy Kroy, Wendy Kroy.

413
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:46,840
You are beautiful.

414
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,000
- I got your note.
- 5 days ago.

415
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,560
- Apology appreciated.
- Apology expired.

416
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,800
A woman has to protect her standing at
the office. You know that.

417
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,760
Look, I was wrong to touch you but you were
wrong to send me to the gas chamber.

418
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,360
So, maybe I over-reacted a little bit.

419
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,960
You... wanna see my new place?

420
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,320
On your back.

421
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,240
I thought we were going to be more than sex
partners. I thought we were going to be friends.

422
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,320
And this entails?

423
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,680
Talking, sharing, clueing me in to whatever
it is that makes you run so hot and cold.

424
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,960
- Can I trust you?
- You know you can trust me.

425
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:07,240
OK. Here it goes. Someone steals a million bucks
but, there's a dilemma - she spends it.

426
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,720
Ah, you see this is exactly what I'm talking about.

427
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,760
You're scared to talk about real things.
You're scared to reveal yourself.

428
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,440
Tell me something I wanna know.
Tell me what brought you to Beston.

429
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:23,240
I don't know Mike. What brought me to Beston?
You're so god-damned intuitive, you tell me.

430
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,280
I tell you what Wendy.
Why don't we talk about me, huh?

431
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,160
Good.

432
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,040
I'm er, I'm a claims adjuster. 
I talk to all different types of people in my job.

433
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,160
Some are happy to be hearing from me,

434
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,760
some are scared to death.

435
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:44,720
A car's been stolen, a child's operation's been botched.
They tell me things that they don't tell anyone else.

436
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,200
It's very intimate.

437
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,280
It's boring.

438
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,160
No Wendy, it's intimate.

439
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,440
I talked to a woman the other day whose
husband just died in a car accident.

440
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,920
It was just a fifty grand payout,

441
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,560
but she said if she knew it was that much
she'd have killed the guy herself years ago.

442
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,440
Said it was the best thing that
ever happened to her.

443
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,360
You see what I'm saying?
I talk to this lady for 20 minutes,

444
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,720
and I know more about her than I know about you.

445
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,280
Her husband sounds like a real gem.

446
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,640
Actually he was a son of a bitch.
I could tell from his credit report.

447
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,840
You can't tell that from a credit report.

448
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,440
Sure you can.
You can tell lots of things from a credit report.

449
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,160
Yeah? Like what?

450
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,720
He had three credit cards, authorised to three
different women, none of which were his wife.

451
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:37,840
What else?

452
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,840
They lived in the suburbs but there was an apartment,
in his name only, in the city.

453
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,040
- She wanted him dead.
- She was happy when he ended up that way.

454
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,640
Uh-huh. He was cheating on her and you could tell
from the credit report.

455
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,280
Pretty much so.

456
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,360
We can make a list.

457
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:01,920
A list?

458
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:20,800
It's like when I got here - they were gonna
use the phone book to prospect some customers.
It was a total waste of time.

459
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,160
Why's that?

460
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,640
The phone book's random.
You gotta make a list tailored to the 
people who are more likely to buy your product.

461
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,520
Mm-hmm. And what type of list are we trying to make?

462
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,320
A cheating husband list.

463
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,480
What do you wanna pitch to cheating husbands?

464
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,680
Nothing. I wanna pitch to their wives.

465
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,840
Why?

466
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,040
Murder.

467
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,320
Murder? Oh, that's very nice...

468
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,760
Your customer said she wanted her husband dead, right?

469
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,480
So, there must be others.

470
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,840
- And you're just gonna sell it to 'em?
- I'm going to try.

471
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,960
There. Men carrying credit unavailable
to their spouses

472
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,960
but available to women other than their daughters.

473
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,800
Owning a home, and renting an apartment

474
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,040
in the same Metropolitan area.

475
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,800
- It's a big list.
- It sure is.

476
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,160
Cross-reference it with inter-state policy owners
of quarter-of-a-million or more.

477
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,400
- Why?
- Profit incentive.

478
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,440
How much? Quarter of a million?

479
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,600
Done.

480
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,000
244 names.

481
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,000
Dial the first one.

482
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,920
- Excuse me?
- Dial it.

483
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,280
I just wanna see if I can do it.

484
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,880
He's home. Next.

485
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,080
Hello, may I speak to a Mr Vincent?

486
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,760
Shit. I think I woke her up.

487
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,040
Oh, it's late.
Cross me for Pacific time.

488
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,360
I'll do it.

489
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,680
Yes, may I speak to a Mr Samuel Renford please?

490
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,600
Oh he's not?

491
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,400
Oh, I assume I'm speaking with Miss Sally Lindo,

492
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,280
authorised user of his First Bank

493
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,720
credit card?

494
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,480
Oh, I'm sorry Mrs Renford.

495
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,000
Please stop crying ma'am.

496
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,320
I'm sure there's a good explanation.

497
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,760
Oh, I see. He's done it before?

498
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,360
Well, you know,
you shouldn't let him get away with this.

499
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:47,360
Well, I know what a friend of mine did.
Yeah, she had her husband killed.

500
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,320

501
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,120
Yes, there are people who actually
specialise in such cases.

502
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,720
Of course there are risks involved
but there are benefits.

503
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,720
Well, does he carry life insurance?

504
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,800
Yes, I could put you in touch with the right people
but I would have to know you were serious about this.

505
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,720
A definitie commitment.

506
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,720
Mrs Renford you do know I'm kidding, don't you?.

507
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,320
You channel that anger and give him
a nice kick in the balls when he gets home.

508
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,040
Good night.

509
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,080
It's do-able. Your turn.

510
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,440
No thankyou! This is your game.

511
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,360
Our game. You said you wanted to be more than just sex partners.

512
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,280
I do.

513
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,480
Commonality Mike. We don't like to have the same kind of fun.

514
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,720
This is fun?

515
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,680
Yeah, it's bending the rules,
playing with people's brains.

516
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,120
Yeah, well whatever er...

517
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,240
We can go to my place afterwards.

518
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,280
Your place?

519
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,680
- I thought it was your place, your space?
- I have more space now.

520
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,720
You're sick.

521
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,520
You're really sick.

522
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,400
Tell me about your wife.

523
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,600
How'd you know?

524
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,200
I didn't.

525
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,440
That's a good trick.

526
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:53,800
Tell me.

527
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,320
Not much to tell.
It happened when I lived in Buffalo.

528
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,640
One of those sudden horny things?

529
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,480
You could say that.

530
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,000
Her idea?

531
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,320
Between fucking?

532
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,840
What's her name?

533
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,560
Trish.

534
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,000
Short for...

535
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,640
Whatever.

536
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,440
Is she pretty?

537
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,960
Are you still in love with her?

538
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,320
I thought you were the one that wanted to talk.

539
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,760
You want me to tell you about Trish?

540
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,560
Trish was a mistake.

541
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,760
Boy from Beston moves to Buffalo.
Gets lonely.

542
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,720
Meets girl. Screws up bigtime.

543
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,160
Nothin' to be ashamed of.

544
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,160
I just wanted some more excitement, you know?
I wanted more adventure.

545
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,680
Until recently, all I wanted to do was get
the hell outta this small town.

546
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,760
Until recently?

547
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,480
That's what I said.

548
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,800
Until recently.

549
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,320
What happened recently?

550
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,200
What happened recently?

551
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,080
What happened, Mike?

552
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,200
Can I have a little privacy please?

553
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,000
Tell me what happened.

554
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,040
You happened, alright?

555
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,640
What's so special about me?

556
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,760
You've been out there.
You came here and you chose me.

557
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:54,840
So?

558
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,800
So I was right.
I'm bigger than this town.

559
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,840
So what's wrong?

560
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,320
You can't stop reminding me
that you're bigger than me.

561
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,360
Good Morning, Alison.

562
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,520
There was a black man here to see you.

563
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,400
What did he want?

564
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,560
He wouldn't say.
He was black though.

565
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,560
Did you tell her about the black man?

566
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:53,800
Frank Griffith please.

567
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,400
He's not in.
Can I take a message?

568
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,840
No message.

569
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,400
What do you mean you're on the run from someone?

570
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,520
Did you lock the door?

571
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,000
- Go check it again.
- It's locked.

572
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,640
What about the top lock?

573
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,840
- Wendy, it's all locked!
- Just check it Mike.

574
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,400
Wendy, it's all locked, OK ?
Locked!

575
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,320
Why in the world would someone be after you?

576
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,360
Do you love me Mike?

577
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:34,680
What?

578
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,440
- I made another sale today.
- A sale?

579
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,160
You know, like that night we worked late in your office?

580
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:49,160
Wendy, if you wanna sell murder to people,
if that's how you have your fun, that's fine by me.

581
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,440
It's nothing that I'm interested in.

582
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,920
Yeah but I can't deliver it without you.

583
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,440
We may have a sale Mike but we didn't deliver.

584
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,160
Deliver murder?

585
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,440
I'm gonna do it.

586
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:07,840
Lance Collier. Financial consultant, retired,
lives outside Miami.

587
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,240
Charms young waitresses with
luxury apartments and credit cards

588
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,120
while his wife Mary Beth sits
at home playing Solitaire.

589
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,160
He's faithful to Mary Beth in one way:
she's the only woman he beats.

590
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,480
She doesn't need the money

591
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,720
but she would like to see him die
with a considerable amount of pain.

592
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,080
You're crazy.

593
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,440
I did a little creative key-punching

594
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,760
and cross-referenced our list parameters
with policy holders at Third Mutual.

595
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,640
You accessed another company's database?

596
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,560
And the good news is:

597
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,920
Our victim does no business with Interstate.

598
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,600
He has no connection to us Mike.

599
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,920
Wendy, you need help.

600
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,800
Look, I'm gonna go out for a while.
You wanna spend the night here, that's fine.

601
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,480
- Talk to me.
- You're deranged.

602
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,480
Mike, the guy deserves it.
Think about his poor wife!

603
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,400
Do you know why I left New York?

604
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,520
To mess with my mind.

605
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,920
Fifteen thousand dollars a year is nothing.

606
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,600
An apartment you're not afraid to walk out of
rents for half that much

607
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,200
and you have to read the god-damned
obituaries to find it.

608
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,360
I'm going back, but I won't live like an animal.

609
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,240
I want you to go back with me.

610
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,960
Really, you do? And all I have to do is kill someone
while you go apartment hunting?

611
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,880
We can do it together.

612
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,640
Wendy, maybe it's my quaint small-town morals
but I don't do murder.

613
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,440
Yeah, well you would if you loved me.

614
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,880
Get some sleep.

615
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,880
Where are you going?

616
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,080
I'm going to play hockey.

617
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,760
Hockey...
I'll come with you.

618
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,840
You're gonna leave me here by myself?

619
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,640
Mike, wait.

620
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,960
I'm scared.

621
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:37,920
Let's go for a little drive.

622
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,240
So how is Clay?

623
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,640
Pissed. We want our money.

624
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,200
- What? Are you two an item?
- Funny woman.

625
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,760
You're on a contingency?

626
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,320
Fifty percent of funds recovered.

627
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,680
- So why even give Clay his half?
- Professionalism.

628
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,360
Wouldn't it be more pleasant to share it with me?

629
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,880
Lady, you had your fun.
Whatever you spent, you spent.

630
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,240
As long as it's within reason.
But it's over.

631
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,200
- You'd get rough?
- I will if I have to.

632
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,840
I can't get it for you tonight.

633
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,600
- Where is it?
- In a bank.

634
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,080
- Show me a statement?
- I don't have a statement.

635
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,560
But they have this 800 line,

636
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,360
you can punch in the account number,
get a balance - it's a real kick.

637
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,000
I imagine. Pull over at the next phone.

638
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,600
I assume that was to get me out of the car,
hoping I'd leave these?

639
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,960
'twas.

640
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,640
- So the money's at your place?
- 'tis.

641
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,040
How much is left?

642
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,960
All but a couple of thou'.

643
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,200
Frugal woman.
Let's go.

644
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,240
Well, what if I hadn't saved it all?
I mean, come on, you can give me a break.

645
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,200
How much?

646
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,760
Hundred grand. I could easily have spent that much.

647
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,920

648
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,160
How the fuck do you stay up here?

649
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,120
I mean these people... 
I go in the store this morning for cigarettes,

650
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,240
they got ducks under the counter.

651
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,320
What? Do they plant these people or do they just grow outta the ground?

652
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,240
And they look at me like...
hell, I don't know.

653
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:47,800
Well, you know; they're not used to seeing guys like you around here
if you... know what I mean.

654
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,880
Is it true what they say?

655
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,120
What?

656
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,400
You know... size.

657
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,120
Is it true what they say about white women?

658
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,680
- What's that?
- No ass?

659
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,600
Oh, come on; I was wondering for real.
Let me see it.

660
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,880
Fuck you. Drive!

661
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,080
I'm sorry.

662
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:12,640
About what?

663
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,240
About your shortcoming.

664
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,680
I'm not gonna play this game.

665
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,320
Is that why you carry a big gun?

666
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,840
The Freudian mind-fuck isn't gonna work either.

667
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,920
Touchy.
I'm sure your woman is very understanding.

668
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,160
Exactly how is it that we end this phase of our relationship?

669
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:32,280
By you showing it to me.
Come on, let me see it. I've never seen one before.

670
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,760
I'll show you my ass.

671
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,080
What makes you think I wanna see your bony ass?

672
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,960
- Show me.
- Show me!

673
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,880
I'm driving. You go first.

674
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,600
Nah, you go first.

675
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,840
You'll shut the fuck up if I show you?

676
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,120
I'm sure I'll be too stunned to speak.

677
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,760
I don't believe this.

678
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,280
You're crazy.

679
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,480
Shit.

680
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,600
OK, there, You happy?

681
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:08,720
What the hell are you doin'?

682
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,880
I'll make sure the press says nothing about your husband.

683
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,080
I really appreciate it.

684
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,320
There's only one more question I need to ask.

685
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,520
I don't mean to pry...

686
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,440
the man with you

687
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:47,400
appeared to be not entirely in his pants
at the time of impact.

688
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,600
Can you tell me what happened
just before you went off the road?

689
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,920
Well, like I told you before he tried to
get me to contact my husband and...

690
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,880
I refused of course.

691
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,800
Well he became... you know,

692
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,360
Motherfucker this, motherfucker that...

693
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,280
Like in the movies?

694
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,080
Exactly.

695
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,520
Next thing I knew...
I only remember bits and pieces of it but he...

696
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,120
the jist of it was that he was going to...

697
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,880
impale me with his

698
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:22,880
big...

699
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:24,960
There's another man

700
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:25,920
waiting to see you when you're through.

701
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,160
I'm through here anyway.

702
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,480
Thankyou ma'am.

703
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,240
You alright?

704
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:44,640
How was hockey?

705
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:49,160
I'm very sorry I walked away.

706
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,400
Wendy, you were just, you were scaring the hell outta me. I mean

707
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,760
The things you were saying - 
you weren't serious?

708
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,520
What do you think?

709
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,480
I don't understand you.

710
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,080
Yeah? Where's the effort to try?

711
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,160
I'm very sorry I walked away.

712
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,160
Mike, what I suggested I suggested for us.

713
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:17,240
The only loser in the whole deal is a rich, cheating, wife-beating

714
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,160
old bastard.

715
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,880
You're talking about murder.

716
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:25,280
Yeah? So?
Oh, I'm sorry - it's one of the commandments, right?

717
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,800
Think about what you're saying.

718
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,160
Is it the morality of murder that bothers you or the personal risk?

719
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,560
Murder is wrong.

720
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:37,680
Yeah, unless the president says to do it.

721
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,400
Let me ask you this: if you found out Lance Collier was dead

722
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,800
would you spend your life bringing
his killer to justice?

723
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,200
Would you go to his funeral?

724
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,040
- Probably not.
- Would you feel sorry for him?

725
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,960
No, and this is not the point.

726
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,800
I really like you Mike.
But I can't live here forever.

727
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:57,720
What does that mean?

728
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,280
Where're you going?

729
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,280
Gotta bring home the bacon.

730
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,320
Are you checked out?
Did the doctors give you permission to leave?

731
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,680
Always looking for the rules, Mike.

732
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,840
You want me to er, come in with you?

733
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:37,880
Are you sure?

734
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,200
- Wendy, are you alright?
- I'm fine.

735
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,880
OK, I tell you what. I'm gonna go home. 
If there's anything you need at all you just gimme a call, alright?

736
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,080
Guess who.

737
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,640
Christ, you're dangerous.

738
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:15,320
The cops called to confirm that
he was working for me.

739
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:19,120
You do know that if you finger me for the deal then 
I'm taking you down too?

740
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,320
I know.

741
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,400
Look out your window.

742
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:29,000
That's Harlan's replacement.
A local. Name's Bert.

743
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,080
He won't hurt you.
I need a New Yorker for that.

744
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,080
He's just there to make sure that
I don't lose track of you again.

745
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,120
He's very professional.

746
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,480
Can we get past this?

747
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,840
There is a nice, warm divorce
waiting for you here.

748
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,320
I want half the money.

749
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,920
- Not a chance, Bitch-et.
- Don't call me that!

750
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,880
I'll call you whatever I want.

751
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:55,680
I borrowed a hundred K from a man 
whose first and last names end in vowels.

752
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:59,880
Every week I owe him a new ten thousand
dollars in interest

753
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,800
and when I come up just a little short,

754
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:05,360
he's got this very fun game
that he plays with thumbs.

755
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,280
I hired a private detective for 50%,

756
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,240
but now that I know where you are 
I am perfectly willing to spend all of the money

757
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,880
in hiring a clinical sociopath
to take it from you,

758
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,840
and fuck you through the eye sockets
JUST FOR FUN!

759
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,240
OK, look - I'll buy a week.

760
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,680
I'll buy a week.
I'll send you ten thousand dollars.

761
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:33,360
No, make it fifteen so you can get back to your life
while I wrap things up here.

762
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:36,520
That sounds interesting.

763
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:41,600
Then I come back,
I'll give you the cash.

764
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,840
Maybe you'll be feeling
a little more generous then?

765
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,040
I keep Bert on your ass.

766
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,440
Of course you do.
I've given you no reason to trust me.

767
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:55,520
Only a week.
And I'm still interviewing sociopaths.

768
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,800
Oh Bridge! What made you do this?

769
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,440
I don't know. You slapped me.

770
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,400
That's just an excuse.

771
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,560
Probably right but I get to slap you back.

772
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,040
Hey, it's a deal.

773
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,120
Slap you back hard.

774
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,960
- Yes, I'm still here.
- You must have your name on the ticket.

775
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,200
What do you mean my name has to be on it?
I'm going to Miami for Christ's sake, not Iraq!

776
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,920
Well it's a regulation.

777
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,800
- Oh yeah? What's the pilot's name?
- Erm, Well I can't tell you that.

778
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,440
Oh, I see. You have to know my name
but I can't know who's driving?

779
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,560
Well, let me ask someone. 
May I put you on hold?

780
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,080
Yes, I'll hold.

781
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:45,880
Am I interrupting?

782
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,440
Don't ever come in here without knocking.

783
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,000
I'm sorry... I knew you were on the phone.
I just didn't wanna...

784
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,800
How long have you been standing there?

785
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,920
Just got here.

786
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:01,040
You going away?

787
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:02,640
Yes.

788
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,000
New York ?

789
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:07,240
Yes.

790
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,560
For good?

791
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,760
No. Just for the weekend.

792
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,640
With everything that's happened,

793
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:22,400
I er, I just... I need to get away for a little bit.

794
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:54,160
I thought you might be hungry sitting
out here all day so I baked you some cookies.

795
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,240
I'll leave this one to your discretion.

796
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,280
Take me to Buffalo.

797
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:34,080
The husband's name is Mike Swale.
I believe they were married about six months ago.

798
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,000
I appreciate this.

799
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:51,840
Hope that does it.

800
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:10,640
Trish?

801
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,760
Hi, I'm Jean Wilbur with the county health department.
We spoke on the phone about your survey.

802
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:15,800
Come on in.

803
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,040
Let's go.

804
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,640
- A beer?
- Yeah, that'd be great. Please.

805
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,040
- How's things?
- Life is good.

806
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,160
Go up to him and tell him...

807
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:51,400
Someone's gotta tell him.

808
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,600
Yeah. I'm serious. Go and tell him.

809
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,480
- Do it.
- Alright, man.

810
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:04,840
Hey Mike, how you doin'?

811
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,880
Hey Chris, alright man, how are you?

812
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,080
Let me get him a drink.
Whatever he wants.

813
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,560
- Yeah, can I get a shot, man?
- You bet Chris.

814
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,080
So, you still seein' that lady?

815
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:21,640
Did I ever tell you once I met her outside of here last week.
She said she wanted to ask me somethin'.

816
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,480
The point?

817
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,360
She said she wanted to know your secret.

818
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:31,400
"What's the last thing Mike'll want me to know?"

819
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,080
What'd you tell her?

820
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,640
I didn't tell her anything man.
I mean, you're my friend.

821
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:43,400
I mean, besides, what do I know about Buffalo?
I mean you only told Shep about the wife and everything.

822
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:45,880
Is that it?

823
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:57,680
She went for me fly and she said 
she wanted to suck it outta me.

824
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,800
Tell me why you're lying Chris!

825
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,040
I'm not!

826
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,600
Alright man, I fucking came on to her
and she shot me down.

827
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,040
Get off him, Mike!

828
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,920
Get off, man!

829
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,120
Clean your face.

830
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,640
Don't be afraid: it's only a machine.

831
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,760
Hey, it's me - designated fuck boy.

832
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:01,280
I know you're outta town but 
I just wanted to hear your voice.

833
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:08,000
I love you! I admit it. I'm sure you 
feel the same way - I'm sure you love you too.

834
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:14,720
You know Wendy, when you first came to town
I really thought you were the one. I... really did.

835
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:19,800
You were on the move.
It meant you couldn't stay here.

836
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,600
I just didn't trust myself after what
happened in Buffalo see.

837
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,360
I just didn't trust myself to be out
on my own, you know and

838
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,400
I seem to lose my judgement outside
of Beston.

839
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,000
Apparently so.

840
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,360
Well, now it seems to be leavin' me here, you know. I...

841
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:44,160
try, I really try to believe that you love me

842
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,400
but you keep treatin' me like
some kind of forage experiment.

843
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,520
You talk about us livin' in New York.

844
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:55,280
I mean really, come on, how long until phhht!

845
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,400
Where'd she go?
Where'd she go?

846
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,400
If I only knew you loved me Wendy...

847
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,520
I can't let you hear this!
I can't let you hear this!

848
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,520
What is this?

849
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,680
Wendy, you didn't go to New York.

850
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,000
Why'd you go to Miami?

851
01:17:58,160 --> 01:17:58,920
Why?

852
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,600
Did you find this er, 
did you find this Lance Collier?

853
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:10,240
Wendy did you m- did you murder Lance Collier ?
Tell me I'm wrong. Did you?

854
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:15,720
Are you gonna turn me in Mike?

855
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,680
Well if I don't, it makes me an accomplice!

856
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,160
Christ, you are good at rules.

857
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:23,760
Wendy, you don't even seem bothered
by what you've done!

858
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,440
I did it for us Mike.

859
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,840
- What bothers me is your attitude.
- My attitude?

860
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,640
I expect unconditional support from 
a lover. For better or worse.

861
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:39,000
Jesus! I killed the bastard.
I wouldn't take it back if I could.

862
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,040
You can't!

863
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:42,160
He deserved it.

864
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,000
- Wendy, nobody deserves to...
- Please!

865
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,440
Spare me your brainless countrified morality.

866
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,960
The world's better off without Lance Collier.

867
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:53,000
Only ten minutes I knew him he proved it
to me twenty times.

868
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,560
Mrs Collier thought so too.

869
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,200
Jesus Christ!

870
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,000
There's your fucking evidence.

871
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,000
And there are my fucking fingerprints!

872
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,240
Hey, maybe you'll get a reward and
you can open up a fucking feed store.

873
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,640
Get the fuck outta here.

874
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,520
You know Wendy, I er, I really
thought you loved me.

875
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,040
I never said that.

876
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,760
You son of a bitch!

877
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,240
Did you sniff my underwear drawer too Mike?

878
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,880
You think you know everything now, don't you?
Well you don't!

879
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,280
We all have our Buffalo girls Mike!

880
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:00,240
You murdered.

881
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,120
You wanna live bigger but there's 
nothin' you'd kill for.

882
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,720
There's a place for people like that:
It's called Beston.

883
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:11,640
Get out.

884
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:13,480
Get out!

885
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,520
Take your fucking shirt too!

886
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:56,520
Come in.

887
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:02,200
Yes?

888
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:03,840
A couple of questions...

889
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:09,400
This guy in Florida.
He really beat his wife?

890
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,520
Like a punching bag.
Country boy.

891
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:18,600
Wendy, I'm trying to accept this, OK.
I really want to be able to take you back.

892
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,960
I'm outta here Mike,
I won the lottery. Going to New York.

893
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,080
I could come with you.

894
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,120
You have a way of making a woman feel
like a one-way train ticket.

895
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,480
It's not like that.

896
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:29,720
Get out on your own, Mike.

897
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,240
- What do you want?
- Nothing you're offering.

898
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:32,400
Try me!

899
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,240
A relationship of equals.

900
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,160
That means commitment.
I've done something committed, you haven't.

901
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:51,480
Oh come on! Murder!
Murder is commitment?

902
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,360
Yeah, when I've done it and you haven't it is.

903
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,680
Fine. OK. Who? Who do you want me to erase?

904
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,400
Who do you want me to kill?

905
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,040
This Cahill guy

906
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:10,400
in New York.

907
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,360
He gets a hold of property tax rolls,
finds out who's delinquent a few bucks

908
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,040
He pays the balance. Then waits.

909
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:23,600
If the sucker doesn't figure out what
happened, Cahill becomes owner of the property.

910
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:28,600
You know what he did last week?
He kicked an 84-year-old woman out on the street with her walker.

911
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,240
That's his credit report.

912
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:32,920
Are you serious?

913
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:37,320
Double indemnity.
Ten million payoff to the widow

914
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,480
if he dies an unnatural death.
She's willing to give us a third.

915
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,080
You called her?

916
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,840
She said she's bought things over the phone before.

917
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,720
You try to make this sound reasonable?

918
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:53,840
It is reasonable.

919
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:59,480
You. Me. Three million bucks.

920
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,000
New York City, Mike.

921
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,280
It's reasonable.

922
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:07,840
Where does this end with you?

923
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,240
Right then. Right with Cahill.
We'd be even.

924
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:17,520
I've just realised that I don't want to
be with you enought to be like you.

925
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:20,880
Get off me!

926
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:00,760
Dear Mike, I got a job at Interstate.

927
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,960
I'll be moving to Beston soon.

928
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:40,280
Dear Mike, I got a job at Interstate
and I'll be moving to Beston soon...

929
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:45,840
No-one has to know about our little secret.
I just wanna be near you. Love, Trish.

930
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:03,960
I'll do it. I'll kill the bastard.
There's just one thing.

931
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:08,560
I am never coming back to Beston.
Not for one second.

932
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:15,400
We pull up sticks, we settle in 
right afterwards.

933
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:17,600
We put all this behind us, alright?

934
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,880
So what made you change your mind?

935
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:25,160
We're gonna have a life together Wendy.
In New York, the two of us, alone.

936
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:29,200
Beston Police Department, Officer Lewis.

937
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:30,160
Hi, Police?

938
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:33,880
This is Mrs Neff, 313 Squire Road.

939
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:38,120
There's this strange man outside my house.
He tried to show his erm...

940
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:41,960
his diddly to my 4-year-old daughter.

941
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,200
Is he still there?

942
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:45,320
We'll have a squad car there in three minutes.

943
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,560
I'm working!

944
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,160
What are you doin'?

945
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:34,040
Hey! She's getting away! 
It's my job! She's getting away!

946
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,800
Give me your cheat sheet.

947
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:44,960
Why?

948
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:47,840
You don't want it on you!
You memorised it, right?

949
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:55,880
Let's hear it.

950
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:03,360
When I get to the Port Authority I go straight outside,
find a cab, don't talk to anybody.

951
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:07,600
I have the cab take me to Broadway
and 125th Street,

952
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,800
I find Cahill's apartment.

953
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:15,840
I wait until 11 O'clock, when we're 
sure the girlfriend's gone.
I wait until the lights go out.

954
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,440
And a half hour more to make sure he's asleep.

955
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:24,160
I put on the gloves. I check and make sure
I've got the cuffs - four pairs.

956
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:30,040
I've got the gun, the knife,
the bandana and the flashlight. Keys too:

957
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:35,880
to the apartment, to the building
and to the doorknob.

958
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:40,400
I walk up the stairs,
I open the apartment door.

959
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,560
I enter, I shut the door,
I lock the door.

960
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,160
I find him.

961
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:50,280
I make sure he sees the gun.
I tell him not to say a word.

962
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:52,000
You hit him hard if he does.

963
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:56,040
I close any open curtains.

964
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:00,440
I turn on the lights,
I tell him I'm just there to rob the place.

965
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:06,360
I find a sturdy chair.
I sit him in it. I toss him the cuffs.

966
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:11,360
I tell him to cuff himself to the chair.
Left hand, right hand, left leg, right leg.

967
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,560
Make sure I hear the click of the cuffs.

968
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:18,480
Then I er, tell him to open up his mouth.
I gag him, tight.

969
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,120
I then use the gun to knock him out
with a blow to the head.

970
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:28,240
And I er, keep stabbing him until he's...

971
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:30,440
dead.

972
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:34,760
Keep going.

973
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,120
I take one final look around, turn off the lights.

974
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,520
I unlock the door, I exit, I shut the door, I lock it.

975
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:45,320
I'll get the gloves.

976
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,760
Why do I have to turn off the lights?

977
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:51,080
Pop psychology.

978
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:54,320
Lets yourself know you've
finished an unpleasant chore.

979
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:58,160
The unpleasant chore...

980
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,520
You're up for this, right?

981
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:33,360
I'm here to rob the place.

982
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:36,920
I thought you were the new decorator.

983
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:41,240
Just shut your mouth,
do what I tell you. Get up, get out of bed.
Come on, get up!

984
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:45,440
Sorry. I don't want to mess with
your concentration...

985
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,280
skilled labour and all.

986
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:53,600
What now?

987
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,840
Go ahead and er, cuff your handcuffs
to your legcuffs there.

988
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,160
- That'll be comfortable!
- I told you to shut up!

989
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:09,320
Now what?

990
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:12,680
I'm gonna gag you.

991
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:18,520
How am I gonna tell you where 
everything is? Am I yelling?

992
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:21,720
You have a gun. I'm cooperating.
Forget the gag.

993
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,040
The gag's important.

994
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,160
Did you read a book on this?

995
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,520
You know, kid, you don't look like a dope-head.

996
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:29,480
What?

997
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:33,120
I just write prescriptions, right?
I got no stash.

998
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,520
The money goes to a loan shark.

999
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:37,640
I got some aspirin in the medicine cabinet.

1000
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,320
But other than that I got nothing here you want.

1001
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:43,000
I'm not interested in your drugs, alright?

1002
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,680
You're just breaking in at random?

1003
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:48,760
Great. The guy next door is outta town for a month.

1004
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:50,680
Open!

1005
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:56,320
My wife has jewellery.

1006
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:34,960
I can't do it Wendy, I can't do it!

1007
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,840
Hold it right there pal, hold it!

1008
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:50,600
Right there!

1009
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:07,400
Talk fast.

1010
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,000
She's my wife.

1011
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,800
Her name's Bridget. 
You know her as Wendy Kroy.

1012
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:15,720
She stole a fortune from me after
making me steal it.

1013
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:17,560
But she's not willing to give it up.

1014
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,280
But she can't come back to New York
without settling with me first.

1015
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:24,360
And that's where you come in.
See, she hired you...

1016
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:29,080
Wait a minute...
Oh, fuck!

1017
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,920
You're into her, huh?

1018
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,080
It's logical: I guess there aren't
many women fuck like her in cow town.

1019
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:44,520
Keep talking.

1020
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,880
You're a schizoid, talk to yourself.

1021
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,040
You really her husband?

1022
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:49,480
Who'd she say I was?

1023
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:50,840
Foreclosure lawyer.

1024
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:52,960
And you believe that?

1025
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:55,040
It says so on the mailbox.

1026
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:55,920
You're crazy.

1027
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,200
It does. It says Cahill on the mailbox.

1028
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:01,080
Find one other thing in here that...

1029
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:11,080
She's here. She's in New York.

1030
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:16,040
She must have switched the label
on the mailbox.

1031
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:22,760
She must have worked up one hell
of a morality play for you

1032
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,160
but you don't like the way it ends.

1033
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:26,520
What are you talking about?

1034
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:30,440
You're supposed to kill Cahill,
only it's me.

1035
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:33,040
Then she fingers you for the murder.

1036
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:35,120
I don't think so.

1037
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:37,520
Oh, she wouldn't lie to you?

1038
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:42,120
Denial. OK, I'm still Cahill.

1039
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:44,840
Did she ever happen to mention
that she knows Cahill?

1040
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:49,800
So well that he would have a picture
of her in his appartment.
That's a pretty major omission, isn't it?

1041
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,880
Will you shut up? Shut up and let me think.
Just shut your mouth!

1042
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:56,040
Take your time.
She probably has the cops heading here right now.

1043
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,240
She has to know that you've
actually offed me first.

1044
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:08,040
You're signalling her.

1045
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:09,480
How?

1046
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,080
I'm calling her later.

1047
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,640
She's not in Beston, cow-boy.

1048
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:06,840
Hi, Bridge.

1049
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:10,080
So you were gonna have me kill your husband.

1050
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:17,080
I was.

1051
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:19,680
And then tip the Police.

1052
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:21,600
- No I wasn't.
- Bullshit.

1053
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:25,440
She tells the cops she's reconciling
with me,

1054
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,440
that's the suitcase.

1055
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:28,680
Shut up, Clay.

1056
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,720
You have a jealous boyfriend.

1057
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:34,360
It was a great idea Bridge,
but I guess Mikey wasn't up to it.

1058
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:36,360
What do you say?

1059
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,480
Is it game, set, match?

1060
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:46,240
Who has the key?

1061
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:48,240
I do.

1062
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:51,320
Oh, fuck.

1063
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:54,480
Funny thing, Bridge.

1064
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:57,920
I coulda put this money some place
where you wouldn't have gotten it.

1065
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:00,720
I might have taken you back.

1066
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:06,080
You're a very funny lady.
You know the role-playing thing?

1067
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:10,040
Baby you make one hell of a horny nun.

1068
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:19,320
What do you say Bridge,
do you wanna stay married?

1069
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,640
What are you doing?

1070
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:37,720
Oh my God!

1071
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:47,600
Now we have a future.

1072
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,240
You're not human.

1073
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:51,760
I did it for us, Mike.

1074
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,680
But he was insured.
Fuck me, Mike.

1075
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:56,640
What?

1076
01:36:57,120 --> 01:37:00,200
It's a role-play.
You're the intruder,

1077
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:02,760
you kill my husband, you rape me.

1078
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:04,800
You're not gonna kill me.
You're not gonna kill me Bridget.

1079
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:07,360
You're gonna kill me if I don't
do what you say, right Mike?

1080
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:09,960
Get offa me.
GET OFFA ME!

1081
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:14,080
You're lucky I don't kill you...

1082
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:15,720
You're lucky!

1083
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:16,760
Rape me, Mike.

1084
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:19,560
You're goin' to jail.

1085
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:23,880
Trish wasn't really coming to Beston, Mike.

1086
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:29,800
What did you say?

1087
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:35,080
You shouldn't've told me you never slept with a man before.
It must've been some wild night

1088
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,000
you getting married so fast.

1089
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,080
He couldn't really...

1090
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:40,480
...how to keep the goods hidden
for a whole two days?

1091
01:37:40,640 --> 01:37:43,920
What'd he do - tell you the little bobbly
thing at the back of your throat was a clitoris?

1092
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,640
You married a man,
you farm faggot!

1093
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:49,280
Shut your mouth!

1094
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:51,600
I'm Trish. Rape me!

1095
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:53,320
- Shut your mouth!
- Rape me!

1096
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:55,440
You wanna be raped?
Is that what you want?
You wanna fucking be raped?

1097
01:37:56,680 --> 01:37:58,400
You wanna play games? OK!

1098
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:00,200
This is 911.

1099
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:03,760
This is 911.

1100
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:07,600
Is this what you want?

1101
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:09,240
I'm gonna rape you.

1102
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:11,360
I'm gonna fucking rape you, bitch!

1103
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:13,560
Miss, miss. I'm tracing your call right now.

1104
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:14,880
You like it?

1105
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:15,960
Don't you wanna be raped?

1106
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,440
- You killed my husband!
- God-damn right!

1107
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,360
You're God-damn right!

1108
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:22,480
You killed my husband!

1109
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:25,440
God-damn right I did!

1110
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:28,600
Alright. Miss, miss? I have located you and
I have a car on the way.

1111
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:33,800
- I'm Trish.
- Are you Trish? Fuck you!

1112
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:39,240
Fuck, fucking bitch!
Fuck you!

1113
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:42,400
Is that what you want?

1114
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:50,840
You like it!

1115
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:17,880
What'd you find out?

1116
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:19,240
Lance Collier exists.

1117
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:23,360
In fact he continues to exist.
He's the guy you described but he isn't dead.

1118
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:27,000
Right, so she stole her husband's
money just like he told me.

1119
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:31,320
But the husband never filed a complaint.
Look at the D.A.'s case Mike:

1120
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:36,400
you go into a man's apartment with a gun and a knife.
That's intent to kill even if you hadn't confessed it.

1121
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:39,480
The wife is there, your girlfriend.
That's motive.

1122
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:42,720
There's a rape on Police tape, along with
a number of murderous threats

1123
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:45,800
all of which goes to establish
a damn tight case.

1124
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:48,480
She gave me the keys to the apartment.
She gave them to me!

1125
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:53,280
They were copies of the originals she possessed.
The jury figures you could have had those made up
at any time.

1126
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:54,240
But...

1127
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:57,320
There's not a trace of anyone's fingerprints
on those keys but yours.

1128
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,320
The mace was hers!

1129
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:03,440
I believe you Mike.
But a jury's gonna be looking for elecrical outlets.

1130
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:10,920
If we had one piece of hard evidence to support
your version of her manoeuvrings

1131
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:13,440
that would be enought to raise reasonable doubt.

1132
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,360
A note she wrote,
the plane ticket to Miami?

1133
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:20,160
Phone calls. She made phone calls from my office.

1134
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:25,520
Your office, and you made all but one of those calls.
She probably faked that one.

1135
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:27,440
Believe me,

1136
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:31,160
You don't want a jury to hear about that night.
THINK!

1137
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:41,040
There might be one thing...

1138
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:05,480
