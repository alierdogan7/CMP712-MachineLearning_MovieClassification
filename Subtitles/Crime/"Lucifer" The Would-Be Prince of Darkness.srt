00:00:00,826 --> 00:00:03,396
LUCIFER: Previously on Lucifer...

2
00:00:03,397 --> 00:00:05,850
So you're the Devil, and
you've left Hell behind

3
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:08,586
to take a vacation in Los Angeles.

4
00:00:08,654 --> 00:00:09,720
How could you possibly help me?

5
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:10,721
I have a certain skill set.

6
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,190
I can be very persuasive with people.

7
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:14,625
I got it, the name, the
whole "Lucifer" thing,

8
00:00:14,693 --> 00:00:16,527
and desire is like your superpower.

9
00:00:16,595 --> 00:00:18,629
- (Lucifer groans)
- CHLOE: How did you survive

10
00:00:18,697 --> 00:00:20,097
getting shot six times?

11
00:00:20,165 --> 00:00:21,285
Is that your normal reaction

12
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:22,266
to someone saving your life?

13
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,700
When I see something I can't explain,

14
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:24,868
yeah, I look for answers.

15
00:00:24,936 --> 00:00:26,616
Well, I've given you
the answer, Detective.

16
00:00:26,637 --> 00:00:28,071
It's not my fault you won't accept it.

17
00:00:28,139 --> 00:00:29,139
CHLOE: What happened with Lucifer?

18
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:30,307
You don't get it, do you?

19
00:00:30,374 --> 00:00:32,442
He's the Devil! He's the Devil!

20
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,744
LUCIFER: Where's your
ex, Detective Douche?

21
00:00:34,813 --> 00:00:35,757
Hi, Daddy.

22
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,712
Hi, munchkin.

23
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,014
CHLOE: Wow, shocker, you're late.

24
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:39,648
Come on, give me a break.

25
00:00:39,716 --> 00:00:40,850
Right, here's the deal.

26
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:44,187
We can have as much naked
cuddle time as you desire,

27
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:46,222
but you're gonna
have to listen to me too.

28
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,957
LINDA: You like to hide insecurity

29
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:49,058
in humor, don't you?

30
00:00:49,126 --> 00:00:50,566
What do you think I'm insecure about?

31
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,261
That you are changing,

32
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:53,962
that you don't know what's
causing the change.

33
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,931
Or who.

34
00:00:56,728 --> 00:00:59,681
_

35
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:04,120
_

36
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:07,594
_

37
00:01:08,477 --> 00:01:10,477
(wind whistling)

38
00:01:26,494 --> 00:01:28,427
Go on.

39
00:01:28,495 --> 00:01:30,964
Go ahead, jump.

40
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,700
You know you want to.

41
00:01:34,768 --> 00:01:36,502
Hmm?

42
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,705
Trust me, it's a warm welcome.

43
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:40,974
Won't it hurt?

44
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:44,509
Oh, there's only one way to find out.

45
00:01:50,216 --> 00:01:53,919
- (cheering, shouting)
- ♪ All day I was out ♪

46
00:01:53,987 --> 00:01:57,356
♪ Feeling, thinking of you... ♪

47
00:01:57,423 --> 00:01:58,423
Lovely.

48
00:01:58,457 --> 00:02:03,494

49
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:05,196

WOMAN: You're the man of the hour.

00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:18,608
Everyone's here to see you.

57
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:20,911
What's the worst that can happen?

58
00:02:20,978 --> 00:02:22,512
Come on, have one drink with me.

59
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:24,547
I can't, I'm sorry, I'm
not trying to be a buzzkill,

60
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:26,149
I'm just... I'm not in
the mood to party, all right?

61
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:28,751
How can you decline this ravishing siren's

62
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:30,553
invitation to imbibe?

63
00:02:30,621 --> 00:02:34,024
(chuckles) Well, if
L.A.'s taught me anything,

64
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:36,358
constant rejections do build character.

65
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:38,060
LUCIFER: Sincerely
doubt "constant rejection"

66
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:39,661
is something you ever deal with.

67
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:40,930
(chuckles)

68
00:02:40,997 --> 00:02:42,932
You could learn a
thing or two from this guy.

69
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:44,934
Oh. (chuckles)

70
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:46,668
Witty, charming and wise.

71
00:02:46,736 --> 00:02:47,769
Have you lost your mind?

72
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:49,538
Do I know you?

73
00:02:49,605 --> 00:02:50,772
Lucifer.

74
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,006
Morningstar.

75
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,875
Right, you're the club owner guy

76
00:02:54,944 --> 00:02:56,110
who grants people favors.

77
00:02:56,178 --> 00:02:58,846
Yeah, I don't need anything from you.

78
00:02:58,914 --> 00:03:00,949
Oh, I beg to differ, Ty.

79
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:02,350
I have been looking for you all night.

80
00:03:02,418 --> 00:03:04,352
And you are in desperate need of my help.

81
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,055
Star quarterback, number-one
draft pick,

82
00:03:07,122 --> 00:03:09,823
and yet, for some
inexplicable reason, a virgin.

83
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,591
Look, man, I got all the
haters I need online, all right?

84
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:14,027
No, no, no, no, no, I'm not criticizing.

85
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:15,128
I'm fascinated.

86
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,730
I mean, do you know how rare you are?

87
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:20,233
A celebrity virgin in Los Angeles,

88
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:21,734
and surrounded by temptation.

89
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,971
I mean, you, Ty, are like

90
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,372
a four-leaf clover and
a unicorn made a baby.

91
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,841
Without, uh, having sex, of course.

92
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,509
(wry chuckle)

93
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,643
MAN: Aw, thanks, I appreciate it.

94
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,271
My agent wanted me to throw this party.

95
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,580
Oh.

96
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:37,116
- Yeah, he wants me to loosen up.
- He's right.

97
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,617
I've met your type before,

98
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,219
so desperate to control their lives,

99
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,553
they forget to enjoy it.

100
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,788
So answer me this.

101
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:47,492
If you were to ever, you know, let go,

102
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:50,161
what is it you'd really want to do?

103
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,097
I, uh...

104
00:03:52,164 --> 00:03:54,032
- Yeah.
- I...

105
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,368
I want to skip my
morning workout sometimes.

106
00:03:56,435 --> 00:03:58,603
- Boring.
- Just chill on the couch

107
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,670
and watch Master Chef.

108
00:03:59,705 --> 00:04:01,105
This is the fantasy life

109
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:02,373
of a postmenopausal housewife.

110
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,875
Come on, Ty, there must
be something deeper.

111
00:04:04,942 --> 00:04:06,377
I, um...

112
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:08,245
Yeah.

113
00:04:08,313 --> 00:04:10,381
I want to get laid so damn bad.

114
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:12,282
(laughing) And there it is.

115
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,785
You got no idea how hard it
is holding out for marriage, man.

116
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:17,853
Uncomfortably hard, I'm sure.

117
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:19,655
(both chuckle)

118
00:04:19,723 --> 00:04:21,391
Look, I was going to with my girl,

119
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,126
but, uh, we broke up.

120
00:04:23,193 --> 00:04:24,193
Oh...

121
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:25,128
I thought she was gonna be

122
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:26,429
the mother of my children.

123
00:04:26,497 --> 00:04:28,457
Well, she wants to be the
mother of your children.

124
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:30,400
Come on, Ty, it's the fourth quarter,

125
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:32,568
but you can still win this game.

126
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:34,636
I mean, look at her, death and taxes

127
00:04:34,703 --> 00:04:36,038
are less of a sure thing.

128
00:04:36,105 --> 00:04:37,272
No, I can't.

129
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,540
But you desire her.

130
00:04:38,607 --> 00:04:39,941
Why fight it?

131
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:42,777
Because my mother taught me that...

132
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:45,013
Oh, no, don't-don't bring
her into this that's disgusting.

133
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:48,016
Uh... it's about you.

134
00:04:48,084 --> 00:04:49,551
What do you want?

135
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:51,685
Her.

136
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:54,021
Well, then "carpe diem," my friend.

137
00:05:01,496 --> 00:05:03,431
Ah, hello again, my little cannonball.

138
00:05:03,498 --> 00:05:05,433
Sorry, I didn't introduce myself earlier.

141
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:09,436
Yes, yes.

142
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,571
I'm the Devil, hope
you'll hold it against me.

143
00:05:11,638 --> 00:05:14,874
Lucifer Morningstar,
the guy who owns Lux?

I've seen him before.

147
00:05:19,012 --> 00:05:20,180
His beats are sick.

148
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:21,948
I very much beg your pardon.

149
00:05:22,015 --> 00:05:23,015
Beats?

150
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:24,217
Yeah.

151
00:05:24,285 --> 00:05:26,051
He performed at a rap
battle last week in the Valley.

152
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:29,555
Every single part of
that sentence horrifies me.

153
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:31,557
It is so gross

154
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:33,992

Is Lucifer a magician?

184
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:57,971
That's sort of what I'm
trying to figure out.

185
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:00,641
When Daddy gets here, maybe he can help.

186
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:01,741
Mm.

187
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:03,310
Sometimes Daddy helps
me with my homework.

188
00:07:03,378 --> 00:07:05,845
I'm not sure if Daddy has the
answers to these questions.

189
00:07:05,913 --> 00:07:08,080
Why don't you just ask Lucifer?

190
00:07:08,148 --> 00:07:11,417
Because if he's a magician,
then he won't reveal his secrets.

191
00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:14,220
So I have to find out on
my own how Lucifer does...

192
00:07:14,288 --> 00:07:17,657
- (cell phone rings, buzzes)
- these things that I can't...

193
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:19,692
explain.

194
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,760
Oh, that can't be him.

195
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:23,095
(phone beeps on)

196
00:07:23,163 --> 00:07:24,163
Decker.

197
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:27,365
Lucifer, how did you
even get this number?

198
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:31,703
LUCIFER: Excuse the mess,

199
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,706
but it's so good of you to
come, Detective Decker.

200
00:07:34,773 --> 00:07:38,710
Thanks for being
super-cryptic in a really unhelpful way.

201
00:07:38,777 --> 00:07:40,011
- (chuckles)
- What's the emergency?

202
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,829
Well, it's-it's better
to show than tell, really.

203
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:51,689
I...

CORONER: Petechial grows
hemorrhaging in the eyes.

206
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:06,759
Contusions on the neck.

207
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:08,314
Signs of strangulation.

208
00:08:08,382 --> 00:08:11,034
And one of the victim's
fake nails was ripped off.

209
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,074
Signs of struggle.

210
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,620
We got a murder on our hands.

211
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,047
Thanks.

212
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:19,859
CHLOE: So what happened?

213
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:22,527
TY: Um, well, I woke up
early, 'cause my head hurt.

214
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:23,595
I, uh...

215
00:08:23,596 --> 00:08:25,330
I had a hangover.

216
00:08:25,398 --> 00:08:27,066
I... I've never drank before, so...

217
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:29,568
That's on me. Sorry.

218
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:31,196
Yeah, so I came down to get some water,

219
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:32,904
and that's-that's when
I saw her in the pool.

220
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:33,972
Did you know her?

221
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:35,473
Not before last night.

222
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,208
I talked to her for a little bit.

223
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:39,210
Her name was, uh...

224
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:40,578
Ali, maybe?

225
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:43,648
I don't know. I mean, I'm
having a hard time remembering.

226
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:47,818
You think she accidentally slipped,

227
00:08:47,886 --> 00:08:49,219
fell in the pool and drowned?

228
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:50,620
No, I think she was murdered.

229
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:52,622
Oh, my God, that's... that's terrible.

230
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,625
So why didn't you call
the police right away?

231
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:57,194
Well, I told Lucifer.

232
00:08:57,262 --> 00:08:58,829
He said... he said that
he would call the police.

233
00:08:58,897 --> 00:08:59,897
LUCIFER: And I did.

234
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:01,731
Detective Decker's a homicide detective.

235
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,900
She's been very helpful

236
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:06,269
in the other murders
that I've encountered.

237
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:09,138
I am not your personal police concierge.

238
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:10,873
You are gonna find out
who did this, aren't you?

239
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:12,141
(inhales)

240
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:14,110
Of course I am, because that's my job.

241
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,577
- Right.
- Not because you want me to.

242
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:17,113
(scoffs) Right.

243
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,701
First things last. Do you have any idea

244
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:20,016
who had contact with her last night?

245
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:23,751
Um, no, uh, no, but they asked
me to get the... the guest list.

246
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:27,189
(quietly) Oh, geez.

247
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:28,489
250 guests.

248
00:09:28,557 --> 00:09:29,691
You know what that means.

249
00:09:29,758 --> 00:09:31,126
Great party.

250
00:09:32,228 --> 00:09:35,130
250 suspects.

251
00:09:36,232 --> 00:09:38,199
Oh. Uh, I'd be careful with that thing

252
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:39,499
in the guest bedroom.

253
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:41,047
There's a good chance you'll go blind.

254
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:42,536
Unspeakable acts.

255
00:09:42,603 --> 00:09:44,872
Yes, we got a little
carried away. (chuckles)

256
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,241
Stop interfering.

257
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:48,508
I'm helping.

258
00:09:48,576 --> 00:09:49,810
You forget that my expertise

259
00:09:49,878 --> 00:09:51,645
is finding the right
people to punish, Detective.

260
00:09:51,713 --> 00:09:52,446
It's what I do.

261
00:09:52,513 --> 00:09:54,348
Or, uh, did, at least.

262
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:55,882
You want to do something?

263
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,051
Then help account for
everyone who was at the party.

264
00:09:58,118 --> 00:09:59,785
- Oh.
- Coroner puts the time of death

265
00:09:59,854 --> 00:10:01,054
between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m.

266
00:10:01,121 --> 00:10:02,288
Actually, is there someone

267
00:10:02,356 --> 00:10:04,196
who can vouch for your
whereabouts at the time?

268
00:10:04,258 --> 00:10:06,092
Several someones, in fact.

269
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,193
Yes.

270
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:09,295
Get them to tell you every little detail

271
00:10:09,363 --> 00:10:11,030
just to make sure that I'm not lying.

272
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:14,032
I'll have someone else handle that.

273
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,369
So... a bona fide killer on the
loose that needs to be punished.

274
00:10:17,436 --> 00:10:18,394
Time to punch in.

275
00:10:18,404 --> 00:10:20,205
There she is.

276
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:22,674
Do you know anyone here?

277
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:24,476
No. Sorry.

278
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:26,478
I mean, people just
show up to these things.

279
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:28,146
Did anyone look suspicious?

280
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:29,650
(scoffs) Where do we start, Detective?

281
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:31,548
I mean, look at those big strong hands.

282
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:33,416
Perfect for squeezing
the life out of someone.

283
00:10:33,418 --> 00:10:36,087
Oh, ginger lad.

284
00:10:36,154 --> 00:10:37,355
Soulless bastards.

285
00:10:37,422 --> 00:10:39,090
Give even me the creeps.

286
00:10:39,157 --> 00:10:40,358
I...

287
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:42,226
You need to sit with the witnesses.

288
00:10:43,195 --> 00:10:44,362
LUCIFER: Haven't I proven myself

289
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:45,709
extremely useful at detectiving?

290
00:10:45,764 --> 00:10:48,899
Actually, no, I don't need
your help color-commentating.

291
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:50,500
I need facts and hard evidence.

292
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,003
So unless you can help
me with either, stay.

293
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,972
But I don't want to be stuck
out here with these miscreants.

294
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,573
These are your people.

295
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:59,823
Detective!

296
00:11:13,391 --> 00:11:15,124
Hey.

297
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:16,458
I heard all hands on deck.

298
00:11:16,526 --> 00:11:18,260
I came as quick as I could.

299
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:19,795
Yeah, and on time.

300
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,231
Look, Chloe, I'm sorry
about earlier, okay?

301
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:24,899
I got held up at an arrest in Hollywood.

302
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,000
I couldn't get away.

303
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:27,068
I get it, Dan.

304
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:28,269
Save the apologies for Trixie.

305
00:11:28,337 --> 00:11:29,603
This is work, and right now,

306
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:31,539
we have a victim with
no fingerprints on file.

307
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:34,242
These all the unclaimed
items from the party?

308
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,944
Yeah, I checked everything.

309
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:38,511
Unfortunately, no I.D.
that matches our victim.

310
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,013
So, what are you thinking?

311
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:43,116
Well, I'm thinking our victim

312
00:11:43,184 --> 00:11:45,319
wore a cute red dress.

313
00:11:45,386 --> 00:11:48,121
There's no way she'd
have that pink clutch.

314
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:49,423
She was out to have fun,

315
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,025
so that nixes anything
big and bulky, like a tote.

316
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:54,093
I don't know.

317
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:55,962
I'm looking for something small,

318
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:57,129
a little sexy...

319
00:11:57,197 --> 00:11:58,998
classy.

320
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:01,567
Something like this.

321
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:02,835
Wait a minute, I-I thought you said

322
00:12:02,902 --> 00:12:04,203
all this stuff was
searched already for I.D.

323
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:05,771
I'm not looking for an I.D.

324
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,073
I'm looking for a car.

325
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,609
(car alarm chirps)

326
00:12:10,677 --> 00:12:12,910
Ali Thornton, 23, from Boise, Idaho.

327
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:14,299
Her info matches the registration

328
00:12:14,313 --> 00:12:15,580
we found in the glove box.

329
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:16,647
Hmm.

330
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:18,450
She was a long way from home.

331
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:21,519
What were you doing here, Ali?

332
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:24,155
I'll see what I can find on her.

333
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:25,323
Detectives,

334
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:26,911
found something in the master bedroom.

335
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,730
Found this here in the bed.

336
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:37,334
And it matches the missing
fingernail of the victim.

337
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:39,903
Isn't this Ty's bedroom?

338
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:45,341
Yeah, looks like they
did a lot more than talk.

339
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:47,410
(woman moaning passionately nearby)

340
00:12:51,715 --> 00:12:53,816
(Lucifer moans with pleasure,
as woman's moans continue)

341
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:55,784
What the hell are you doing?

342
00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:58,388
Well, since you banished
me outside with the lepers,

343
00:12:58,455 --> 00:13:00,523
I decided to make myself useful.

344
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,358
You call watching porn
on your phone useful?

345
00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:05,127
This isn't my phone, Detective.

346
00:13:05,194 --> 00:13:07,229
I think it's our recently departed's.

347
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,901
Where did you get this?

348
00:13:12,968 --> 00:13:14,808
Just heard a ringy-ding
and followed the noise.

349
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:15,707
Now, is delete the little

350
00:13:15,732 --> 00:13:16,462
- rubbish bin?
- No.

351
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:18,573
You can't delete anything on this phone.

352
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:20,274
But it shows Ty and Ali having sex.

353
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:21,842
It's very distracting.

354
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,910
(quietly) Wait.

355
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:24,111
Ooh, you've reached the money shot?

356
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,414
Are you taping this?

357
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,017
TY: I don't know.

358
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:32,086
Over there, we had a drink.

359
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:34,422

364
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:47,342

- Stay out of this, Lucifer.

you're under arrest

368
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:51,271

369

giving him a wonderful time?

379
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:21,895
Ty had a squeaky-clean image.

380
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,739
He sleeps with a girl.

381
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:25,407

00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:27,076

You saw the video.

385
00:14:29,746 --> 00:14:31,346
The only thing that that video proves

386
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:32,480
is that Ty had sex.

387
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:34,582
He was horny, not murderous.

388
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,890
Then why would he lie about it?

389
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,518
Blame the tequila.

390
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,754

540
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:58,354
Why? I didn't even go to the party.

541
00:19:58,421 --> 00:19:59,754
I had to work.

542
00:19:59,822 --> 00:20:01,923
CHLOE: You spoke to the victim a
few hours before she was killed.

543
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,727
Maybe it's best if I don't say
anything without my attorney.

544
00:20:05,795 --> 00:20:07,496
Joey! Joe, Joe.

545
00:20:07,563 --> 00:20:08,864
There's no need for that.

546
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:10,799
Why don't you

547
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:12,867
tell me what you really want, hmm?

548
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:16,937
What desires drive a
man such as yourself?

549
00:20:19,841 --> 00:20:23,311
I want to be the greatest
agent of all time.

550
00:20:23,379 --> 00:20:24,945
Really?

551
00:20:25,014 --> 00:20:26,114
And to do that,

552
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:29,316
I need to protect my clients.

553
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:31,118
Come on.

554
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:34,254
And, uh...

555
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:37,057
If you want to protect
Ty, tell us what you know.

556
00:20:42,096 --> 00:20:44,297
(chuckles) Let's make a deal.

557
00:20:44,365 --> 00:20:47,233
I'll tell you everything.
You look into something.

558
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,300
Here's a deal.

559
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:49,601
Tell us everything, and I don't

560
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:51,003
cuff you in front of your
co-workers and take you in.

561
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,271
I know how this goes.

562
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:54,540
Ali's a young actress
looking for a break.

563
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:57,143
An agent promises to
help her out, in exchange,

564
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,530
she's treated them like a party
favor to your star clients.

565
00:20:59,546 --> 00:21:01,280
Okay, okay.

566
00:21:01,348 --> 00:21:03,781
I did call Ali.

567
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:05,883
I hired her to have sex with Ty.

568
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:07,452
Wow, seems I wasn't the only one

569
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,055
who wanted the young
virgin to loosen up.

570
00:21:10,122 --> 00:21:11,956
No, I loved the virgin angle.

571
00:21:12,024 --> 00:21:14,459
It's a clean hook, got
him a lot of attention.

572
00:21:15,594 --> 00:21:18,696
But Ty was a mess.

573
00:21:18,764 --> 00:21:20,064
I needed him

574
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:22,399
to get over his ex.

575
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:23,534
Why?

576
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,071
Geez.

577
00:21:27,138 --> 00:21:29,906
Popular boy, this Ty... isn't he?

578
00:21:29,974 --> 00:21:32,809
So what, did this anger
his ex or something?

579
00:21:32,877 --> 00:21:36,180
No, it's from his ex,

580
00:21:36,247 --> 00:21:38,214
Debra Macall. She left this behind

581
00:21:38,282 --> 00:21:39,848
one of the many times she came here

582
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:41,284
trying to find him.

583
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:43,052
She used to call all the time
trying to get a hold of him.

584
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,387
So, he dated a crazy fan?

585
00:21:44,455 --> 00:21:46,489
He didn't know it at the beginning.

586
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:49,225
So when I figured it out, he
had already fallen for her.

587
00:21:49,293 --> 00:21:51,694
Oh, suppose I can understand why.

588
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:52,928
(chuckles)

589
00:21:52,996 --> 00:21:54,829
JOE: See, after a while,
Debra got possessive,

590
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:55,897
controlling...

591
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:57,499
she thought she was managing him.

592
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,701
So I told Ty he needed
to break up with her.

593
00:21:59,768 --> 00:22:01,236
He refused.

594
00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:03,972
I made Ty file a restraining order

595
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,574
after she broke a girl's nose

596
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:06,874
just for buying him a mojito.

597
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:08,543
Quite a hair trigger on this Debra,

598
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:10,579
- by the sounds of it.
- Hmm.

599
00:22:10,646 --> 00:22:12,913
If Debra found out

600
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:15,182
that Ty was with that poor girl...

601
00:22:22,056 --> 00:22:24,625
Hmm. Finally, some rain.

602
00:22:24,692 --> 00:22:26,827
Maybe someone up there
is looking out for us.

603
00:22:26,894 --> 00:22:28,128
I can assure you,

604
00:22:28,195 --> 00:22:30,730
He's in no way
meteorologically inclined.

605
00:22:30,797 --> 00:22:32,037
Apart from the whole Noah thing,

606
00:22:32,065 --> 00:22:34,267
and that was a one-off.

607
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:39,772
Anyhow, her roommate confirmed

608
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,541
that she took the 4:00 p.m. class, so...

609
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:43,909
Ty's ex should be out any second now.

610
00:22:43,977 --> 00:22:45,944
I told you you had the wrong man.

611
00:22:46,012 --> 00:22:47,746
Wrong gender as well, apparently.

612
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:49,014
Finally, we're getting warmer.

613
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:52,017
Why are you so hell-bent on
proving Ty's not the killer?

614
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:53,084
Like I've been saying,

615
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:54,886
I want to punish the real killer.

616
00:22:54,954 --> 00:22:56,255
But why?

617
00:22:56,322 --> 00:22:57,756
Is it 'cause you pushed him
towards Ali at the party?

618
00:22:57,823 --> 00:23:00,559
Well, I don't see what that
has to do with anything.

619
00:23:00,627 --> 00:23:01,993
And I think you're
starting to agree with me.

620
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:03,894
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be here, would you?

621
00:23:03,962 --> 00:23:05,163
- Bye!
- Bye!

622
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,198
CHLOE: There she is.

623
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:10,301
(women conversing
indistinctly in distance)

624
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:11,669
That was great. I'll call you at lunch.

625
00:23:11,736 --> 00:23:13,937
- I'm over here.
- CHLOE: Debra Macall?

626
00:23:14,005 --> 00:23:15,339
I'm Detective Decker, LAPD.

627
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:17,575
We need to ask you a few
questions about Ty Huntley.

628
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:19,076
I've got nothing to say.

629
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:20,704
It's either here or down at the station.

630
00:23:20,744 --> 00:23:22,412
- Leave me alone!
- CHLOE: Debra...

631
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,085
(car alarm blaring, horn honking)

632
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:32,255
See?

633
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:33,890
Warmer.

634
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,860
Found this on the undercarriage.

635
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:45,281
Remote detonator.

636
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:47,984
Whoever set off this bomb was nearby.

637
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,652
Scour the security cameras in the area.

638
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,623
Get facial I.D.'s on anyone
in a hundred-block radius.

639
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,324
LUCIFER: You couldn't live with
yourself for committing murder,

640
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,192
so you set your car
to explode, didn't you?

641
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,261
Eh? Wanted to go out
in a blaze of glory.

642
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:00,162
Of course not!

643
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,665
Murder? What are you talking about?

644
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:03,932
LUCIFER: Oh, come on...

645
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,280
The bomb was triggered remotely.

646
00:24:05,334 --> 00:24:07,702
Whoever set it off did it
before you got to the car.

647
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,004
There's a clear line of sight.

648
00:24:09,071 --> 00:24:10,672
I don't think the plan was to kill you.

649
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,240
I think they wanted to scare you.

650
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:15,043
So... you know of any reason why
someone would want to do that?

651
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,045
No.

652
00:24:17,112 --> 00:24:18,647
Yes, why did you run, Debra?

653
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:20,214
Awfully guilty-looking.

654
00:24:21,282 --> 00:24:22,642
I thought you were going to bust me

655
00:24:22,684 --> 00:24:24,084
for violating my restraining order.

656
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,820
I went to Ty's party last night.

657
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:28,956
I-I just... I just looked.

658
00:24:29,024 --> 00:24:30,390
From outside, through the window.

659
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:31,458
I couldn't help it, I miss him.

660
00:24:31,526 --> 00:24:33,928
Yes, breaking up's so hard, isn't it?

661
00:24:33,995 --> 00:24:35,729
You're like two pathetic peas in a pod.

662
00:24:35,797 --> 00:24:37,531
Okay, we are made for each other.

663
00:24:37,598 --> 00:24:39,032
As good as he is at football,

664
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:41,200
that's how good I am
at being his girlfriend.

665
00:24:41,268 --> 00:24:42,702
You mean ex-girlfriend.

666
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,737
We never stay broken
up. It's just a phase.

667
00:24:44,805 --> 00:24:47,473
And no one looks out for
him the way that I do.

668
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:50,610
And then I saw him
kissing that girl and I...

669
00:24:50,678 --> 00:24:51,711
Squeezed the life out of her?

670
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:53,212
DEBRA: No!

671
00:24:54,214 --> 00:24:55,146
Where were you between

672
00:24:55,214 --> 00:24:56,494
1:00 and 3:00 a.m. this morning?

673
00:24:58,051 --> 00:25:01,186
The only place that always
makes me feel better.

674
00:25:01,253 --> 00:25:03,254
(sobbing)

675
00:25:05,524 --> 00:25:06,825
DAN: How long does this go on?

676
00:25:06,893 --> 00:25:08,193
CHLOE: Three hours.

677
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,128
(wry laugh)

678
00:25:10,196 --> 00:25:11,756
That's the saddest thing I've ever seen.

679
00:25:11,797 --> 00:25:14,198
CHLOE: Yep. All-night froyo shop

680
00:25:14,265 --> 00:25:16,567
puts Debra there well past
the time of the victim's death.

681
00:25:16,635 --> 00:25:18,135
Her alibi checks out.

682
00:25:19,537 --> 00:25:21,472
So Debra didn't strangle Ali.

683
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:23,273
Well, whoever planted the bomb

684
00:25:23,341 --> 00:25:25,610
went to great lengths to
make us think Debra did it.

685
00:25:25,677 --> 00:25:27,144
Why?

686
00:25:27,212 --> 00:25:28,212
I don't know.

687
00:25:31,716 --> 00:25:35,719
We might actually know
who rigged the car.

688
00:25:38,222 --> 00:25:39,222
Ronnie Hillman.

689
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,492
CHLOE: The big Hollywood fixer?

690
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,559
Yeah.

691
00:25:43,628 --> 00:25:44,661
A security cam caught her

692
00:25:44,729 --> 00:25:46,369
walking nearby, right
after the explosion.

693
00:25:46,429 --> 00:25:47,549
This can't be a coincidence.

694
00:25:47,597 --> 00:25:48,957
Someone must've hired her for this.

695
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:51,266
I've been trying to build
a case on her for years,

696
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:52,774
and every time we've approached her,

697
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:54,670
she's lawyered up immediately.

698
00:25:54,738 --> 00:25:55,938
Ronnie is a pro.

699
00:25:56,006 --> 00:25:57,205
So how do we approach her?

700
00:25:57,273 --> 00:25:58,507
She's picky about talking to strangers.

701
00:25:58,574 --> 00:26:01,143
Definitely no cops.

702
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,914
What about someone

703
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,517
she'd never expect us to work with?

704
00:26:09,584 --> 00:26:11,318
LUCIFER: Do I get a code word?

705
00:26:11,386 --> 00:26:13,387
You know, for when you take her down.

706
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:15,322
If so, might I suggest

707
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,557
"monkey bottoms"?

708
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:17,905
'Cause trust me, I can work that

709
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,993
into any sentence quite naturally.

710
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:20,961
You sure this is a good idea?

711
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:22,262
Lucifer reached out to her

712
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:24,364
and she agreed to meet
him, so it's our best shot.

713
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:27,167
And you won't need a code
word, and you won't be miked,

714
00:26:27,234 --> 00:26:28,702
because she'll be looking for that.

715
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,770
This is a simple handoff.

716
00:26:29,804 --> 00:26:31,738
All we need you to do is vouch for Dan

717
00:26:31,806 --> 00:26:33,073
as someone that needs her services.

718
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:34,875
Vouch for Detective Douche?

719
00:26:34,942 --> 00:26:37,843
Oh, gosh, this is gonna
be harder than I thought.

720
00:26:37,911 --> 00:26:39,311
Once I engage with her, I will hire her

721
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:40,379
to fix a problem of mine.

722
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,380
Right.

723
00:26:41,414 --> 00:26:42,715
Well, if it's that stick up your ass,

724
00:26:42,783 --> 00:26:44,750
I'm afraid there's no one
strong enough to pull that out.

725
00:26:44,818 --> 00:26:46,138
She goes there to fix my problem,

726
00:26:46,186 --> 00:26:47,853
our people will be
waiting to arrest her.

727
00:26:47,921 --> 00:26:49,055
- Ah.
- CHLOE: And then we'll have leverage

728
00:26:49,122 --> 00:26:50,790
to find out what she
knows about Ali's murder.

729
00:26:50,857 --> 00:26:52,424
She has information we need,

730
00:26:52,492 --> 00:26:53,772
so let's just stick to the plan.

731
00:26:53,826 --> 00:26:55,626
Assuming, of course,
Ronnie hasn't run off

732
00:26:55,695 --> 00:26:56,961
because our sting suddenly turned into

733
00:26:57,029 --> 00:26:58,362
a Michael Bublé concert.

734
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:00,999
Lucifer, this isn't a game.

735
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:03,234
- Oh.
- Now, are you up for this or not?

736
00:27:03,302 --> 00:27:07,205
Am I up for encouraging someone
to commit a nefarious act?

737
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:08,740
Mm, let me think.

738
00:27:08,808 --> 00:27:10,675
Put me in, Coach.

739
00:27:10,742 --> 00:27:12,676

Mm, you checking for a wire

759
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,957

Mmm! (chuckles)

763
00:28:07,595 --> 00:28:09,263
Hello, Mr. Morningstar.

764
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,732
Rest assured...

765
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,533
I can help you with your problem.

766
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:16,237
Well, actually, I don't need your help.

767
00:28:16,304 --> 00:28:17,772
I...

768
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,873
Wait, what do you think my problem is?

769
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,775
Impostor running around
ruining your name.

770
00:28:21,842 --> 00:28:25,178
Your professional reputation
has taken a bit of a dive.

771
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,949
As has your sexual one, I'm afraid.

772
00:28:30,017 --> 00:28:32,252
All those unsatisfied ladies...

773
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,187
Word gets around.

774
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,190
That is the reason you
reached out to me, isn't it?

775
00:28:42,495 --> 00:28:43,628
Yes.

776
00:28:43,696 --> 00:28:44,930
Yes, it very much is.

777
00:28:44,998 --> 00:28:47,266
I do have a problem
that could use your help.

778
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:48,533
I am all yours.

779
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,903
Oh! Well, I like you,
monkey bottoms. (chuckles)

00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,937

782
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:56,407

what are you doing?

00:28:56,474 --> 00:28:57,675
(music playing over speakers)

784
00:28:57,742 --> 00:28:59,177
Hey, Dan, what's going on?

785
00:29:00,846 --> 00:29:02,413
DAN: I don't know.

786
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,215
They're still talking.

787
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:09,220
And now she's leaving.

788
00:29:11,622 --> 00:29:13,223
LUCIFER: Lovely.

789
00:29:14,525 --> 00:29:16,226
What the hell did you do?

790
00:29:16,294 --> 00:29:19,362
I hired the fixer to fix
a problem, like you wanted.

791
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,931
You let her go. What
happened to the plan?

792
00:29:20,998 --> 00:29:23,066
- I made a better one.
- How?

793
00:29:23,134 --> 00:29:24,334
Just sit tight

794
00:29:24,401 --> 00:29:25,836
and we'll all get what we want.

795
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:37,454
- Finally!
- (whimpers)

796
00:29:37,522 --> 00:29:40,090
The would-be Prince of Darkness.

797
00:29:40,158 --> 00:29:42,092
Payment due upon delivery.

798
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,160
(wry laugh)

799
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:45,729
I'd like to examine the goods first.

800
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:46,996
RONNIE: Your dime.

801
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:52,902
Right.

802
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:55,438
Let's see the face of my impostor.

803
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:00,310
(Maze laughs)

804
00:30:01,812 --> 00:30:03,845
The resemblance is uncanny.

805
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:10,085
It most certainly is not.

806
00:30:10,152 --> 00:30:11,220
(giggling)

807
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:13,154
How could anyone think that you were me?

808
00:30:13,223 --> 00:30:15,890
(false British accent): You
know who you're messing with?

809
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:18,126
I'm Lucifer freaking Morningstar!

810
00:30:18,194 --> 00:30:19,661
Oh...

811
00:30:19,729 --> 00:30:20,828
Are you now?

812
00:30:20,895 --> 00:30:23,764
Well... you've certainly
been a busy bee,

813
00:30:23,832 --> 00:30:25,966
haven't you, "Lucifer"?

814
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:27,204
Eh?

815
00:30:27,205 --> 00:30:29,270
Apparently, you've
started a modeling agency,

816
00:30:29,338 --> 00:30:32,139
pitched a Web series.

817
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,542
And I hear you've also been

818
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,644
very active with the women.

819
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:37,777
Ladies love me.

820
00:30:37,845 --> 00:30:39,279
What can I say?

821
00:30:39,347 --> 00:30:42,014
It's what they've been
saying that's the trouble.

822
00:30:42,082 --> 00:30:44,917
It seems you're a bit
of a two-pump chump.

823
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:46,253
Also, a crier afterwards.

824
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,187
That happened one time.

825
00:30:48,256 --> 00:30:51,057
Right. Well, we can't
have you running around

826
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,792
cheapening the Lucifer
brand, now, can we?

827
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,160
What do you say, Maze?

828
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,928
Impalement?

829
00:30:56,996 --> 00:30:58,364
MAZE: Hmm...

830
00:30:58,431 --> 00:31:00,899
Why rush?

831
00:31:00,967 --> 00:31:02,834
- I say the rack.
- Oh.

832
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,436
- Oh!
- Ooh.

833
00:31:04,504 --> 00:31:05,837
That way,

834
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,640
we can really enjoy it.

835
00:31:07,707 --> 00:31:09,575
LUCIFER: Better. Yes, much better.

836
00:31:09,643 --> 00:31:11,809
Every joint of every limb

837
00:31:11,877 --> 00:31:13,611
dislocated before it's torn off.

838
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,681
No, no, no, no, no... look,
look, look, I just... I just...

839
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,183
I just wanted to get
chicks and-and free drinks.

840
00:31:19,251 --> 00:31:21,018
Um, really.

841
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,921
(dropping accent) My name is Justin.

842
00:31:23,989 --> 00:31:24,989
I'm from Sherman Oaks.

843
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,123
(Maze and Lucifer laughing)

844
00:31:26,191 --> 00:31:28,292
Oh, Justin...

845
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:30,059
the things I'm gonna do to you.

846
00:31:30,127 --> 00:31:31,561
Oh, no, no, no, I-I'm sorry!

847
00:31:31,629 --> 00:31:32,796
I only came here one time

848
00:31:32,863 --> 00:31:34,631
and I just told some girls

849
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:35,999
that I owned the place, and...

850
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:37,601
and that opened some doors for me

851
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:38,868
and so I just started rolling with it.

852
00:31:38,936 --> 00:31:41,672
How dare you abscond my name!

853
00:31:41,739 --> 00:31:43,440
Please, don't hurt me.

854
00:31:43,508 --> 00:31:44,775
Please.

855
00:31:44,842 --> 00:31:46,122
LUCIFER: I'm not gonna hurt you,

856
00:31:46,142 --> 00:31:48,444
Justin, I'm going to destroy you.

857
00:31:48,512 --> 00:31:50,746
Oh, this is so hot.

858
00:31:50,814 --> 00:31:53,683
It's like you're punishing yourself.

859
00:31:59,055 --> 00:32:02,191
Seems I could be just, um,

860
00:32:02,258 --> 00:32:03,858
overreacting a bit.

861
00:32:08,263 --> 00:32:10,031
Go.

862
00:32:10,098 --> 00:32:11,265
Go on!

863
00:32:13,068 --> 00:32:14,803
And never sully my name again.

864
00:32:18,774 --> 00:32:20,441
Let's at least take a finger.

865
00:32:20,508 --> 00:32:21,975
We've done enough, Maze.

866
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:30,551
Pleasure doing business
with you, Lucifer.

867
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:31,985
Yes, it was, wasn't it?

868
00:32:32,053 --> 00:32:34,555
Which is why I'm going to have
to apologize for my friends.

869
00:32:34,622 --> 00:32:35,723
What friends?

870
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,989
CHLOE: Ronnie Hillman,

871
00:32:37,057 --> 00:32:39,024
you're under arrest for
kidnapping and assault.

872
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,398
Would you mind calling my lawyer?

873
00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:47,586
(handcuffs tightening) Her
number's in my back pocket.

874
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:49,101
Yeah, sure thing.

875
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:50,670
I'll tell her about the kidnapping,

876
00:32:50,738 --> 00:32:52,204
the airtight evidence we have,

877
00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:54,172
the attempted murder on Debra Macall,

878
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,360
and then when we connect
you to Ali Thornton's murder,

879
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:57,809
maybe you'll get a
nice injection of drugs,

880
00:32:57,877 --> 00:32:59,811
and you can go to sleep forever.

881
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:04,015
Hang on... I had nothing
to do with Ali's murder.

882
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:08,253
Debra Macall, Ty Huntley's
ex, she's the murderer.

883
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,021
I cared about Ali.

884
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:11,422
Mm-hmm, here's what I think.

885
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,324
I think you tried to scare Debra
into confessing to Ali's murder,

886
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:15,626
but Debra didn't do it.

887
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:17,395
She's got an ironclad alibi.

888
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:22,332
This is my fault.

889
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:24,167
Why?

890
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:27,871
I promised Ali I would protect her.

891
00:33:27,938 --> 00:33:30,640
All she ever wanted
was to be an actress.

892
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,375
She was gonna leave her mark.

893
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:33,610
But you know how that goes.

894
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:36,979
Endless rejection, she ran out of money.

895
00:33:37,047 --> 00:33:39,949
This was her first gig with me.

896
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:41,951
She didn't even know if she could do it.

897
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:46,221
But I told her... I told
her it was just like acting.

898
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:49,525
Besides, who doesn't want
to sleep with Ty Huntley?

899
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:52,227
I thought Ty's agent hired
Ali to sleep with him.

900
00:33:52,295 --> 00:33:55,464
He hired me for a number
three special: blackmail.

901
00:33:55,532 --> 00:33:58,667
Slip him a roofie, get naked,
whip out a selfie stick,

902
00:33:58,735 --> 00:33:59,935
and voilà.

903
00:34:00,002 --> 00:34:01,702
LUCIFER: Why would he have any desire

904
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,237
to blackmail his own star client,

905
00:34:03,305 --> 00:34:04,839
a client he's all about protecting?

906
00:34:04,907 --> 00:34:07,809
Ty's agent told you
that Debra killed Ali.

907
00:34:07,876 --> 00:34:10,778
He did, yeah.

908
00:34:20,387 --> 00:34:21,855
You think Joe's the killer,

909
00:34:21,923 --> 00:34:24,791
that he took things into his
own hands, quite literally.

910
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:25,992
We don't have any proof.

911
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,629
Right, well, how do you
propose that we get him?

912
00:34:30,665 --> 00:34:32,599
Joe pointed the finger right at Debra,

913
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:33,867
painted her as crazy.

914
00:34:33,935 --> 00:34:35,401
It's not that hard a picture
to paint, in her case.

915
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:38,003
Why was he so certain
she'd make a good suspect?

916
00:34:38,071 --> 00:34:41,106
Maybe he found out
she went to Ty's party.

917
00:34:41,174 --> 00:34:43,709
Maybe he knew she went to Ty's party.

918
00:34:54,461 --> 00:34:58,413
You are looking at
the future of football.

919
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:00,549
The American Dream.

920
00:35:00,617 --> 00:35:04,953
Honest, resilient, heroic.

921
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,143
The police tried to pin

922
00:35:07,168 --> 00:35:11,293
the death of that poor girl on you.

923
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:14,128
But we kept it out of the press.

924
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:17,365
We got you out of jail.

925
00:35:17,432 --> 00:35:19,433
We will always protect you...

926
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:22,403
and make you a bigger star than ever.

927
00:35:22,471 --> 00:35:25,273
This is Ty Huntley...

928
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,841
rebranded. (laughs)

929
00:35:33,314 --> 00:35:34,314
LUCIFER: Rebranded, eh?

930
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,048
Does it come with a new scent?

931
00:35:36,116 --> 00:35:37,183
Free toy inside?

932
00:35:37,251 --> 00:35:39,118
What do you want?

933
00:35:39,186 --> 00:35:41,521
Ty is free on bail.

934
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:43,657
We have to talk to Ty
down at the station again,

935
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,458
maybe walk him past a few reporters.

936
00:35:45,526 --> 00:35:47,025
Whoa, hold on, uh, Joe, what is this?

937
00:35:47,093 --> 00:35:48,794
Oh, come on! This is ridiculous.

938
00:35:48,861 --> 00:35:51,029
Ty wouldn't hurt anybody!

939
00:35:51,097 --> 00:35:52,298
What about Debra?

940
00:35:52,365 --> 00:35:53,732
I told you to look into her.

941
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,900
She's the crazy one.

942
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:56,402
Yes, well, I thought
it was her all along.

943
00:35:56,469 --> 00:35:58,671
I mean, the woman certainly
redefines "intensity."

944
00:35:58,738 --> 00:36:01,540
But Debra was home with a
friend the night of the murder.

945
00:36:01,608 --> 00:36:02,675
What?!

946
00:36:02,742 --> 00:36:03,908
She's lying.

947
00:36:03,975 --> 00:36:05,735
There's no evidence
placing her at the party.

948
00:36:05,744 --> 00:36:06,778
No one saw her.

949
00:36:06,845 --> 00:36:09,246
So are you ready to face the cameras?

950
00:36:09,315 --> 00:36:10,782
His sponsors will love
the free publicity.

951
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:13,785
Tell me, what's ten percent of nothing?

952
00:36:13,852 --> 00:36:15,520
I saw Debra there.

953
00:36:17,189 --> 00:36:20,390
I went by the party.

954
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:24,861
But a work call came up,
and I never made it inside.

955
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:26,496
I didn't say anything before

956
00:36:26,564 --> 00:36:29,333
because I told my wife
I was working late.

957
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,470
When I was driving away, I
saw Debra outside Ty's window.

958
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:36,139
So you admit you were there that night.

959
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:38,841
Yeah, and so was Debra.

960
00:36:38,908 --> 00:36:40,188
That's the proof you need, right?

961
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,450
CHLOE: That's the proof we need.

962
00:36:41,511 --> 00:36:43,946
We have a sworn statement
from Ronnie Hillman

963
00:36:44,013 --> 00:36:45,214
saying that you hired the victim

964
00:36:45,281 --> 00:36:47,350
to make a sex tape with
Ty to blackmail him.

965
00:36:47,417 --> 00:36:48,851
I just needed to place you at the scene.

966
00:36:48,918 --> 00:36:50,653
LUCIFER: Yeah, see,
that's why I don't lie.

967
00:36:50,721 --> 00:36:52,722
It's so hard to keep
track of who knows what.

968
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:54,389
It's not true.

969
00:36:54,457 --> 00:36:56,791
I only want what's best for you, Ty.

970
00:36:56,859 --> 00:36:58,092
You know, I still don't understand.

971
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,794
Why is it my own agent
would want to blackmail me?

972
00:36:59,862 --> 00:37:02,664
Because he thought eventually
you were gonna leave him.

973
00:37:02,732 --> 00:37:04,833
What, because I took one
meeting with another agency?

974
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:07,001
Joe...

975
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:08,570
I only did that to make Debra happy.

976
00:37:08,637 --> 00:37:10,037
But even though you'd broken up,

977
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:11,345
he knew you'd get back together,

978
00:37:11,373 --> 00:37:14,107
so he decided to strike
first, get some leverage.

979
00:37:14,175 --> 00:37:17,411
If he left me, I would be ruined.

980
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:19,145
I mean, do you understand?

981
00:37:19,213 --> 00:37:20,581
He is my Brady, my Manning.

982
00:37:20,648 --> 00:37:23,283
But Ali wasn't cut out for
this sort of thing, was she?

983
00:37:23,351 --> 00:37:24,885
She didn't want to give you the video.

984
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:26,520
Stupid bitch.

985
00:37:28,322 --> 00:37:30,990
She said she realized Ty was a good guy.

986
00:37:31,057 --> 00:37:32,291
She didn't want to go through with it.

987
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:35,695
Her name was Ali Thornton,
and you killed her.

988
00:37:35,763 --> 00:37:36,896
For what?

989
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,031
Greed? Ego?

990
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:40,299
I didn't want to hurt her.

991
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:42,902
I just wanted her phone. And...

992
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,837
(Joe sighs)

993
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:51,410
But I squeezed too hard.

994
00:37:52,978 --> 00:37:54,012
I'm done.

995
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,314
Forget this. I'm out of here.

996
00:38:00,986 --> 00:38:03,320
(gasps)

997
00:38:03,388 --> 00:38:05,222
Did I squeeze too hard?

998
00:38:06,725 --> 00:38:08,926
How did you...?

999
00:38:08,993 --> 00:38:10,193
What did...?

1000
00:38:10,261 --> 00:38:12,195
Lucifer, what are you doing?

1001
00:38:12,263 --> 00:38:14,532
Finally focusing my
anger where it belongs.

1002
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:15,633
Lucifer...

1003
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:22,204
(chuckles)

1004
00:38:22,272 --> 00:38:24,808
Yes, of course.

1005
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:26,375
Your turn, Detective.

1006
00:38:26,444 --> 00:38:29,879
(sirens wailing, radio chatter)

1007
00:38:35,553 --> 00:38:37,986
I still can't believe Joe did this.

1008
00:38:38,054 --> 00:38:41,824
I wasn't ever gonna
leave him, you know that?

1009
00:38:41,891 --> 00:38:43,358
Definitely gonna leave him now.

1010
00:38:43,426 --> 00:38:45,093
But you know what, you, uh...

1011
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:46,962
you stayed good to your word, Lucifer.

1012
00:38:47,029 --> 00:38:48,129
Thank you.

1013
00:38:48,197 --> 00:38:51,266
Yes, well, now you owe me one.

1014
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:55,970
DEBRA: Ty!

1015
00:38:56,037 --> 00:38:57,738
Ty! Ty!

1016
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:00,541
Oh, my baby.

1017
00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:02,142
Oh, my God, I'm so glad to see you.

1018
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,378
- Oh.
- You are?

1019
00:39:04,446 --> 00:39:05,813
Yes, you are crazy, baby.

1020
00:39:05,881 --> 00:39:08,248
- But you're my crazy, you hear me?
- Yeah?

1021
00:39:09,952 --> 00:39:12,385
Warms the cockles, doesn't it?

1022
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:15,254
So, Detective,

1023
00:39:15,322 --> 00:39:17,023
looks like you've solved another case

1024
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:18,091
because of me.

1025
00:39:18,092 --> 00:39:19,659
I solved this case despite you.

1026
00:39:19,727 --> 00:39:21,862
What? What about the cell phone I found?

1027
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:23,129
That was key evidence.

1028
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:24,498
Evidence you almost destroyed.

1029
00:39:24,565 --> 00:39:27,066
I got you the leverage
you needed to crack Ronnie.

1030
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:29,502
You co-opted a sting
operation for your own gain.

1031
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:31,937
And I solved another crime.

1032
00:39:32,005 --> 00:39:34,106
Identity theft. (chuckles)

1033
00:39:34,173 --> 00:39:37,109
Come on, admit it... we
solved this one together.

1034
00:39:37,176 --> 00:39:39,912
<i>Or are you too egotistical
to acknowledge my help?</i>

1035
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:44,349
Okay, yeah, you didn't
completely destroy the case.

1036
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:46,818
So you can stop blaming yourself, great.

1037
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:48,319
Whatever do you mean?

1038
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:52,289
The whole reason you tried
to prove Ty's innocence?

1039
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:54,492
Was to catch the true culprit.

1040
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:57,962
Yeah, sure.

1041
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:04,167
LUCIFER: So I decided
not to punish myself.

1042
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,903
Yourself?

1043
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,138
Well, my fake self.

1044
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,439
The person I'd kidnapped.

1045
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,708
I decided not to beat him up.

1046
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,210
(sighs) You were right, I was, um...

1047
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:15,979
- (sighs loudly with satisfaction)
- What's the word?

1048
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:17,514
Displacing?

1049
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,516
Displacing my anger and
frustration on Luci-phony,

1050
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,553
because the right person wasn't
being punished for Ali's death.

1051
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,555
And who was the right person?

1052
00:40:25,622 --> 00:40:28,290
Well, the sleazy agent, of course.

1053
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:30,560
Ah, yeah.

1054
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:33,796
Of all the cities in the world, Lucifer,

1055
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:36,464
why did you decide to
come to Los Angeles?

1056
00:40:36,532 --> 00:40:38,466
Well, the same reason as everyone else.

1057
00:40:38,534 --> 00:40:40,268
Uh, the weather, porn stars,

1058
00:40:40,335 --> 00:40:42,103
Mexican food... mm!

1059
00:40:42,171 --> 00:40:43,504
Mmm.

1060
00:40:43,573 --> 00:40:45,573
You know, you say... you
say people are phony here,

1061
00:40:45,575 --> 00:40:49,510
but I think people come
here to reinvent themselves.

1062
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:51,512
And I think that's why you're here.

1063
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:53,513
To reinvent yourself.

1064
00:40:53,582 --> 00:40:56,349
Why would I mess with perfection?

1065
00:40:57,686 --> 00:41:00,487
You like working with
the detective, don't you?

1066
00:41:02,857 --> 00:41:04,792
I told you, I'm good
at punishing people...

1067
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:07,595
nay, I'm the best at
punishing bad people.

1068
00:41:07,662 --> 00:41:10,063
I didn't enjoy it when
my father forced me to,

1069
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,065
but now that it's on my own terms,

1070
00:41:12,132 --> 00:41:13,866
it's downright delightful.

1071
00:41:13,934 --> 00:41:16,069
Yeah, well, I think you don't just enjoy

1072
00:41:16,136 --> 00:41:17,870
punishing the bad guys.

1073
00:41:17,938 --> 00:41:20,073
I think you're starting
to like seeking justice

1074
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,341
for the good ones.

1075
00:41:25,512 --> 00:41:26,612
Like Ali.

1076
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:27,846
(Lucifer scoffs)

1077
00:41:29,682 --> 00:41:31,349
It's another reason to hate L.A...

1078
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:33,085
all this self indulgent therapy.

1079
00:41:33,152 --> 00:41:34,252
You should be ashamed.

1080
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,721
You're doing it again.

1081
00:41:35,788 --> 00:41:36,822
What?

1082
00:41:36,889 --> 00:41:38,556
Displacing.

1083
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:40,358
No, I'm not.

1084
00:41:40,426 --> 00:41:41,960
And that's denial.

1085
00:41:42,028 --> 00:41:44,161
That's a river in Africa.

1086
00:41:44,229 --> 00:41:46,163
