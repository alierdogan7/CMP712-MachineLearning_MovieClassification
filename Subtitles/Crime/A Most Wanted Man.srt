Don't underestimate Mohr.

185
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,089
He's got a lot of friends here in Berlin.

186
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,682
<i>Why don't you give him the Chechen?</i>

187
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,923
<i>Let him shine while you
stay focused on Abdullah.</i>

188
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,443

a shipping company.

00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,569
Not yet, but close.

191
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,010
I need more time.

192
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,243
<i>I'll do what I can, Günther,
but watch your back.</i>

193
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,682
Word is the Americans
are taking an interest.

194
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,889
- Thanks for the warning.

00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,730
Günther Bachmann?

198
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,805
Martha Sullivan. US Embassy, Berlin.

199
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,611
I know you by reputation, of course.

200
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,484
That can't be good.

201
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,727
Men with good reputations
usually aren't much use to me.

202
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,604
What about women?

00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,209
This is my colleague lrna Frey.

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,641

- Hello.

205
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,041
She sails and spies.

206
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,165
I don't sail.

207
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,801
Hamburg's a long way from Berlin.

208

What are you doing here?

209
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,088
Me? I am just an observer.

210
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,526
I have been observed by Americans before.

211
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,728
It usually doesn't end well.

212
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,080
From what I'm hearing, we're not the ones

213
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,289

OTTO: Good morning, everyone.

215
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,760
<i>Herr</i> Mohr has compiled a report.

216
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,568
Our investigations confirm

217
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,210
that lssa Karpov

218
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,763
is a member of a militant Salafi group
of Chechen jihadists.

219
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,207
Karpov was arrested soon after the capture

220
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,601
of the group's leader earlier this year.

221
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,406
Where did this information come from?

222
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,681
We have excellent resources
inside the Russian state security system.

223
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,321
After 24 hours of questioning,
Karpov confessed

224
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,047
to taking part in attacks on gas pipelines,

225
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,203
transport, infrastructure, police stations.

226
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,482
After 24 hours of Russian questioning

227
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,006
any one of us would admit to anything.

228
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,445
Are you contesting this report?

229
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,891
No. Yes.

230
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,166
Maybe.

231
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,364
We've not yet had the
benefit of reading it.

232
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,566
(SIGHS) The report concludes that
the terrorist Karpov has come to Hamburg

233
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,329
seeking to make contact
with lslamist cells operating in the city.

234
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,926
They hide among us.

235
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,570
- Really?
- OTTO: Yes.

236
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,920
Karpov is a wanted man.

237
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,367
If you have knowledge of his whereabouts,

238
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,570
you are obliged to follow
due process under the constitution.

239
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,165
You mean arresting him?

240
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,203
Issa Karpov is indeed seeking
to make contact in Hamburg,

241
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,321
with a banker.

242
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,084
We've had no briefing on this.

243
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,400
Well, if you were doing your job,
you wouldn't need one.

244
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
We're not policemen.

245
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,724
We're spies.
Issa Karpov may be of value to us.

246
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,167
All I'm asking for is more time.

247
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,888
Our unit was set up to develop
intelligence resources

248
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,440
inside Germany's Islamic community.

249
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,284
- That's why we're here.
- Oh.

250
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,488
And I thought you were here
because you fucked up in Beirut

251
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,528
and your friend Michael
Axelrod had no idea...

252
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,211
This banker, do we know
what Karpov wants from him?

253
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,806
Not yet and if we move against him now,

254
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,564
the chances are we never will.

255
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,126
I think he knows what he's doing, Otto.

256
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,202
Maybe you should let him get on with it.

257
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,044

Yes.

This is a process I'm guessing
your bank is familiar with?

00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,370
Is the number an account reference
in use at this bank?

343
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,125
(SIGHS) I'm afraid my bank

344

in which it does its business.

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,728
I'm sure that suits your clients very well.

to an account held at this bank,

quite some time ago.
