00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,364
- Honey, that's not...
- Yes, it is true.

530
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,689
I can't support you.

531
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,087
Oh, Jeannie.

532
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,051
Shh. It'll be okay.

533
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,567
The baby won't be here
for another three months.

534
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,090
Mrs. Berkis will let us slide on the rent
a little longer, she feels sorry for me.

535
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,330
She hates me.

536
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,929
She comes out in the hallway to scowl
at me every time I take the stairs.

537
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,604
That smell like cat litter and old people.

538
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,042
I've just got to get you out of here
before the baby comes.

539
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,044
All I need is enough money
to get us set up in a decent neighborhood.

540
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,250
For crying out loud, there are girls on
the street who earn that in a weekend

541
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,850
without having to tell a single joke
or blow a punch line.

542
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,604
(LAUGHS)

543
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,447
Come here and stop worrying about us.

544
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,206
I love you, job or no job.

545
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,846
You're good in the sack
and you make me laugh.

546
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,846
CARNY OWNER: Let me tell you something.

547
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,368
You ain't going to regret
buying this place.

548
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,164
It ain't as bad as it looks.

549
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,443
I hope you're wrong about that.

550
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,128
Come on, a little spit and polish,
you'll have yourself one hell of a carnival.

551
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,965
(CHUCKLES) Oh, you are so right,
and thanks to your smooth salesmanship

552
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,125
and your silver tongue,
I'm completely sold.

553
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,645
Let's shake on it.

554
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,882
Sure, sure, it's my privilege.

555
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,611
Yes, yes, it is.

556
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,486
Who are they?

557
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,484
Spit and Polish, my attorneys.

558
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,644
They persuaded your partner
to sign over the deed about an hour ago.

559
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,928
The property's already mine.

560
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,524
I can see that you're happy about that.

561
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,125
Now, I must dash.

562
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,124
There's equipment to rent,
plus workers to hire,

563
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,124
and of course,
I need to secure my main attraction.

564
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,408
Uh, do feel free to stick around.

565
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,721
Your refreshments, Master Bruce.

566
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,809
Well, then, sir, do you need my further
assistance or should I just go away?

567
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,365
That'll be fine.

568
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,126
Trying to figure out
what he intends to do.

569
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,248
It's almost impossible.

570
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,370
Excuse me if I find that comforting, sir.

571
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,846
I don't know him, Alfred.

572
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,330
All these years and I don't know who he is
any more than he knows who I am.

573
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,250
Are you sure of that?

574
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,641
What do you mean?

575
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,167
I mean don't underestimate him.

576
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,601
I don't and neither should he
underestimate me.

577
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,727
You can't save everyone, sir.

578
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,286
He drives me.

579
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,001
How can two people hate so much
without knowing each other?

580
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,647
I hate this. Whenever we jail him, I pray,
"Please, God, just keep him there."

581
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,285
And then when he escapes, it's,

582
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,920
"Please don't let him
do something too awful this time."

583
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,081
I hate it.

584
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,642
Dad, just once, could you leave
your work at the office and relax?

585
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,610
I made you some cocoa.

586
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,605
Thanks, but tonight
I could use something a little stiffer.

587
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,321
You know, I found that
Catwoman scrapbook you couldn't.

588
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,084
It was behind the wardrobe.

589
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,331
You really ought to let me work
out a filing system for you,

590
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,329
something like we use at the library.

591
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,571
GORDON: Mmm-hmm.

592
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,641
Oh, look.

593
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,406
You've got paste squidging out,
don't get it on your pants.

594
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,961

you're fussier than your mother was.

That must be Colleen. She's early.

We're going to work out.

598
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,285
You'll have to entertain her
while I get ready.

599
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,649
(CHUCKLES) Look at this one.
First time they met.

600
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,644
He was just robbing banks then. Remember?

601
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,929
What I remember is you describing
his white face and green hair.

602
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,242
I was just a kid,
scared the hell out of me.

603
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,805
GORDON: I thought you'd be interested.

604
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,203
Yeah, well, I had some
really interesting nightmares.

It's just a psychological manifestation,
common among librarians.

00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,367
She thinks she's a coffee table edition,

612
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,444
though I can't say much
for this volume's condition.

613
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,688
I mean there's a hole in the jacket

614
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,810
and the spine appears to be damaged.

Will you?

618
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,849
Refreshing to hear, not by the book.

619
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,449
Speaking of which, this one won't be
walking off the shelf anytime soon.

620
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,207
In fact, the idea
of her walking anywhere seems remote.

621
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,160
But then, that's always
a problem with softbacks.

needs to be and please, do be careful.

To prove a point.

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,885
Here's to crime.

You see, I have a reason, a good one.

632
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,164
I have to prove myself...

633
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,802
As a husband and a father.

634
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,371
I mean, well, this isn't the sort of thing
I'd agree to do normally,

635
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,363
without an important reason.

636
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,761
Of course.

00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,931
Did I ever tell you
I started out as a lab assistant?

638
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,366
Of course, I did, right?

639
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,848
A good job, a real good job,
but my heart wasn't in it.

640
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,240
So, I quit to be a comedian,
to make people laugh

641
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,482
because when they laugh, they feel good.

The thing is... (SCOFFS) They didn't.

643
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,480
Now I'm not feeling good.

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,041
That's why I'm here, for one big score!

we'll get away with it?

00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,490
Leave us alone for a moment.

701
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,123
Barbara, I don't know if you can hear me.

702
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,241
BARBARA: Batman?

703
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,001
Batman.

704
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,242
He took Dad, he...

705
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,611
Oh, God! I remember.

706
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,247
Barbara, take it easy. It's okay.

707
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,004
No, no, it's not okay.

708
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,448
He's taking it to the limit this time.

709
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,887
You didn't see his eyes.

710
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,845
He said he wanted to prove a point.

711
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,168
Said Dad was top of the bill.

712
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,130
What's he going to do?
What's he going to do to my father?

713
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,562
Huh? What?

714
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,611
- Wait!
- Up!

00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,642

Don't, please.

00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,570
Why are you doing this?

722
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,050
Where are you taking me?

00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,361

JOKER: Doing?

728
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,926
You're doing what any sane man in your
appalling circumstances would do.

729
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,085
You're going mad.

730
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,362
I remember.

731
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,727
JOKER: (LAUGHS MANIACALLY)
I wouldn't do that.

732
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,281
Remembering's dangerous.

733
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,001
I find the past such a worrying,
anxious place.

734
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,767
Yes, memory is so treacherous.

735
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:25,642
One moment you're lost in a carnival
of delight, childhood aromas,

736
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,882
the flashing neon of puberty,

737
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,089
all that sentimental candyfloss.

738
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,569
The next, it takes you
somewhere you don't want to be.

739
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,802
Somewhere dark and cold,

740
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,289
filled with damp, ambiguous-shaped things
you'd rather forget.

741
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,401
Memories can be vile,
repulsive little brutes.

742
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,450
Like children, no?

But can we live without them?

747
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,561
Memories are what our reason is based on.

748
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,644
If we deny them, we deny reason itself.

749
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,610
Although, what's wrong with that, really?

750
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,969
It's not like we're contractually
tied down to rationality.

751
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,370
There is no sanity clause.

752
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,447
So when you find yourself locked
onto an unpleasant train of thought,

753
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,241
headed for places in your past
where the screaming is unavoidable...

754
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:24,167
Remember this, there's always madness.

755
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,641
You can just step outside,

756
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,765
close the door on all
those dreadful things that happened.

757
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,641

Uh... Well, of course.

761
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,409
It'd be crazy to back out now.

762
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,930
I mean, the worst part,
lying to Jeannie, that's done.

763
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,284
She thinks I have a club engagement.

764
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,847
No reason she shouldn't
keep right on thinking that.

765
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,408
Now, about tonight,
wear a suit and a bow tie.

766
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,530
It's kind of the trademark
with this Red Hood business.

767
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,126
It's what Jeannie
will expect me to wear to the night club.

768
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,611
Ah! It's perfect.

769
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,891
Excuse me, sir?

00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,520
Could we speak to you outside
for a moment?

There was an accident this morning...

Testing the baby bottle heater.

777
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,125
An electrical short and my wife died.

00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,529
Gee, that's terrible. We're really sorry.

779
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,930
The cops said it was
a million-to-one shot accident.

before I went to the hospital.

Oh, no, no, no, I'm sorry about your wife,

790
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,930
but what's happening tonight,
it's no little thing.

791
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:55,646

anybody backing out remains healthy.

around here, right away.

862
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,842
he broke out of the nuthouse again,
he's had a roll.

863
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,010

thing for him is to...

00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,686
What?

I don't know.

00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,449

01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,045
My point is...

1053
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,451
I went crazy.

1054
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,240
And I'm smart enough to admit it.

1055
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,529

about how many times

1061
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:59,849
we've come close to World War III over
a flock of geese on a computer screen?

1062
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,484
Silly goose, it's all a joke,

1063
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:07,686
everything anybody's ever valued
or struggled for, it's monstrous.

1064
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,684
Why can't you see the funny side?

1065
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,969

(GRUNTING)

1067
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:24,446

I spoke with Commissioner Gordon
before I came in here.

1071
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,647
He told me he wanted
this done by the book.

1072
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,411
You know what that means?

1073
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:43,246
It means that despite all your sick,
cruel, vicious little games,

1074
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,528
he's as sane as he ever was.

1075
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:48,564
So, ordinary people don't crack.

Kick the hell out of me
and get your standing ovation.

No, not this time.

1086

I don't want to hurt you.

1087

I don't want either of us
to end up killing the other.

1088

But we're running out of alternatives.

1089

Perhaps it all hinges on tonight.

I don't know what it was
that bent your life out of shape,

1091
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:54,051
but maybe I've been there, too.

1092
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,164
Maybe we could work together.

1093
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,084
I could rehabilitate you.

1094
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,802
You don't need to be alone.

We don't have to kill each other.

Let me help you.

1097
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,806
I'm sorry, but no.

1101
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,289
This reminds me of a joke.

1102
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,162
See, there were two guys
locked in a lunatic asylum

1103
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,483
and one night, one night they decided
they didn't like that anymore.

1104
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,165
They decided to escape.

1105
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,731
So, they made it up to the roof and there,

1106
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,247
just across this narrow gap,
they see rooftops,

1107
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:51,529
stretching across town,
stretching to freedom.

1108
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:54,326
Now, the first guy,
he jumps right across, no problem.

1109
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:58,127
But his friend, (CHUCKLES) no way,
he's afraid of falling.

1110
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,248
So, the first guy, he has an idea.

1111
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:03,330
He says,
"Hey, I got this flashlight with me.

1112
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,528
"I'll shine it across the gap
between the buildings

1113
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:08,411
"and you can walk across
the beam and join me."

1114
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,131
But the second guy says,
"What do you think I am, crazy?

1115
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,489
"You'll just turn it off
when I'm halfway across."

1116
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,083
(LAUGHING) Excuse me.

1117

Going to practice
some Wallball this weekend.

Getting pretty good.

Maybe another night, Dad,
I got plans tonight.
