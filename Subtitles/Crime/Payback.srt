00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:27,832
Haskell: Anyhow,
this guy Stegman called.

368
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:29,869
Sounded all nervous.

369
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:32,497
Sounded like something
scared the shit out of him.

370
00:29:32,573 --> 00:29:34,040
He said
he had to talk to you.

371
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:36,702
l said l'd see
what l could do, Val.

372
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:38,870
Yeah? Did he tell
you what it was about?

373
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:40,709
He said to tell you
Lynn was dead.

374
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:43,011
Said some guy came
around talking mean...

375
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:44,550
and wanted you.

376
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:47,610
That's all he said.
Thought you oughta know.

377
00:29:47,688 --> 00:29:49,451
Yeah,
you did right.

378
00:29:49,523 --> 00:29:51,081
l want to talk to
that son of a bitch.

379
00:29:51,158 --> 00:29:53,718
Haskell:
Who, Stegman?

380
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:57,025
No, President Nixon.
Of course Stegman.

381
00:29:57,097 --> 00:29:59,827
Tell him Varrick's
by the bridge.

382
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,869
Make it...Hmm...

383
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:05,427
make it
20 minutes, huh?

384
00:30:05,506 --> 00:30:07,337
Can't you see
l'm working here?

385
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:14,441
Unh!

386
00:30:14,515 --> 00:30:16,676
Can't you see
l'm working here?

387
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,183
Oh, yeah.

388
00:30:20,721 --> 00:30:21,983
Put it on
my tab.

389
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:24,751
Porter:
l'm looking for a girl.

390
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:27,293
She goes by
the name of Rosie.

391
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:29,124
Here's a picture of her.
You know her?

392
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:34,732
She worked by telephone.
Wouldn't be freelance.

393
00:30:34,802 --> 00:30:37,771
Probably connected
with the syndicate.

394
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:40,898
Outta my league.
l wouldn't know her.

395
00:30:40,974 --> 00:30:43,408
Well...

396
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:45,104
maybe you know
somebody who would.

397
00:30:51,418 --> 00:30:53,318
Why you looking for her?

398
00:30:53,387 --> 00:30:55,082
l'm her brother.
l got cancer.

399
00:30:55,155 --> 00:30:57,089
l want to see her
one last time.

400
00:30:57,157 --> 00:30:58,954
You know how it is.

401
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:04,926
Yeah, you two look close.

402
00:31:08,235 --> 00:31:09,395
Got a cigarette?

403
00:31:15,008 --> 00:31:18,409
Your sister sounds expensive.

404
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:21,778
Try Michael, bartender
at the Regal Hotel.

405
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:25,147
That wasn't the name
l was looking for.

406
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:28,450
lt's the only one l got.

407
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:56,715
Steggie.

408
00:31:56,783 --> 00:31:58,307
Hey, pal, you know,
l tried to call you...

409
00:31:58,385 --> 00:32:00,250
but you must have changed
your number again.

410
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,344
l got nothing.

411
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:03,946
l never gave you
my original number.

412
00:32:05,392 --> 00:32:06,723
What did this guy
look like?

413
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:10,854
Well, he had, like,
dark hair, blue eyes.

414
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:13,661
He was a real
Cro-Magnon-looking bastard.

415
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:14,701
lf Lynn's dead...

416
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:16,531
maybe he did us
a favor, huh?

417
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:17,968
l know what you mean...

418
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:19,130
except l'm out
like a grand a month.

419
00:32:19,206 --> 00:32:21,902
Maybe we can work
something out.

420
00:32:21,975 --> 00:32:23,465
Did you get a name?

421
00:32:23,544 --> 00:32:26,069
Mmm. He said
his name was Porter.

422
00:32:27,414 --> 00:32:29,279
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

423
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:31,943
He said he was there
for Porter?

424
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:34,544
No. He said he was Porter.

425
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:40,384
Yeah.

426
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,757
l'll tell you something.

427
00:32:41,828 --> 00:32:43,762
l wouldn't want that guy
after me, either.

428
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,422
l know how you must feel.

429
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:47,592
What am l, a nobody?

430
00:32:47,668 --> 00:32:48,896
No.

431
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:50,095
l've got friends.

432
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,138
All l have to do
is point.

433
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:53,365
l pick up a phone,
say his name...

434
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,372
and he's a dead man.

435
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:56,432
And this time
he stays dead!

436
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,307
Val, try to keep it down.

437
00:32:58,378 --> 00:32:59,970
All right?

438
00:33:00,047 --> 00:33:01,537
lt's OK.

439
00:33:01,615 --> 00:33:03,480
What did he say
about me?

440
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:06,280
Nothing. He just said
you owed him money.

441
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:08,116
Not why?
Nothing else?

442
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:09,314
Nothing.

443
00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:10,822
Why?
How much you owe him?

444
00:33:10,891 --> 00:33:12,984
None of your
goddamn business.

445
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,029
l just got the feeling
he'd like to kill you...

446
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:17,586
that's all.

447
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:19,689
Oh, Christ.

448
00:33:19,766 --> 00:33:21,529
Porter.

449
00:33:26,807 --> 00:33:27,739
What?

450
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,901
What did you tell him?

451
00:33:29,977 --> 00:33:31,672
Nothin'.

452
00:33:31,745 --> 00:33:33,212
What could l tell him?

453
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,508
You tell him
about the money?

454
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:35,570
The heroin?

455
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:37,480
He had it with him.

456
00:33:37,551 --> 00:33:39,280
l told him l delivered it.

457
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:40,581
You didn't tell him
nothin' else?

458
00:33:40,654 --> 00:33:42,645
l don't know nothin' else.

459
00:33:42,723 --> 00:33:45,453
Nah. You gave him
something.

460
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:46,583
A name, maybe.

461
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,525
Someone who knows
where to find me.

462
00:33:48,595 --> 00:33:50,085
l swear, Val,
on my mother--

463
00:33:50,163 --> 00:33:51,460
Hey, fuck your mother!

464
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:54,591
Hey, that's not nice.
Try to take it easy.

465
00:33:54,668 --> 00:33:56,397
What the fuck
you looking at?

466
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,869
Take it easy.
Not again.

467
00:33:57,938 --> 00:33:59,166
Huh?

468
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:00,638
What the fuck
you looking at?

469
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:02,004
No, Val, not again.

470
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:03,940
What the fuck
are you looking at?

471
00:34:04,011 --> 00:34:05,171
Val, come on, don't.
Not again.

472
00:34:05,245 --> 00:34:08,146

some trouble here?

473
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:11,309
No. We're just--
We're leaving.

474
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:12,682
You know what, Val?

475
00:34:12,753 --> 00:34:14,584
This one's on me, OK?

476
00:34:14,655 --> 00:34:17,123
You see me reaching
for my fucking wallet?

477
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,487
No.

478
00:34:21,094 --> 00:34:22,118
Sorry.

479
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:23,890
He just got
a promotion...

480
00:34:23,964 --> 00:34:26,057
so he's
a little tense.

481
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,464
Hey, pal, is there
a Michael here?

482
00:34:29,536 --> 00:34:30,798
That's him
over yonder.

483
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,417
Michael.

horizontal refreshment.

l'm looking for a girl
named Rosie.

487
00:34:41,758 --> 00:34:44,124
Prostitution is illegal...

488
00:34:44,194 --> 00:34:45,821
and you're speaking Greek.

489
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:50,623
Usually these matters...

490
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,430
are conducted
with more discretion.

491
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:57,337
Aah!

492
00:34:57,407 --> 00:34:58,635
Be discreet now.

00:35:00,744 --> 00:35:01,836
[Coughs]

494
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,607
What was her name again?

495
00:35:05,682 --> 00:35:06,740
Rosie.

496
00:35:06,816 --> 00:35:08,408
And who should l say
is looking for her?

497
00:35:08,485 --> 00:35:09,509
Just call her.

498
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:20,591
- Rosie?
- Yeah.

499
00:35:20,663 --> 00:35:22,426

Give me the phone.

500
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:23,796
Here.

501
00:35:23,867 --> 00:35:25,960
Take care of that.

502
00:35:27,704 --> 00:35:28,636
Rosie.

503
00:35:28,705 --> 00:35:30,297
Who the hell is this?

504
00:35:30,373 --> 00:35:31,431
Porter.

505
00:35:31,508 --> 00:35:34,841
Try again, honey.
Porter's dead.

506
00:35:34,911 --> 00:35:36,640

509
00:35:42,352 --> 00:35:43,717
Yeah.

510
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,356
Porter: Why pour salt
on old wounds?

511
00:35:58,435 --> 00:35:59,925
l didn't need to.

512
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:05,808
l guess l had
a soft spot for her.

513
00:36:23,526 --> 00:36:25,391
Hi.

00:36:29,432 --> 00:36:30,694

for a dead guy.

How'd you hear about it?

517
00:36:43,379 --> 00:36:45,040
People who know
were talking.

518
00:36:45,115 --> 00:36:48,380
Plus, l heard your wife
was back in town alone.

519
00:36:49,786 --> 00:36:51,014
She's dead.

520
00:36:52,489 --> 00:36:54,184

00:36:58,027 --> 00:37:00,325
Jesus. Surly Porter.

You're the same
as ever, aren't you?

00:37:06,002 --> 00:37:07,799
This doesn't
look like you.

Come on, sweetheart.
lt's OK.

What's his name?

531
00:37:24,587 --> 00:37:26,316
Porter.

532
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,917
He took your job
after you left.

533
00:37:29,993 --> 00:37:31,187
He's just as tough...

534
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:33,821

will you, baby?

''syndicate'' anymore.

Yeah. l met up with him
once a few years ago.

548
00:38:19,075 --> 00:38:21,009
He can't use
Star Service anymore...

549
00:38:21,077 --> 00:38:23,045
because he beats up
all the girls...

550
00:38:23,112 --> 00:38:25,444
and he almost killed one.

551
00:38:25,515 --> 00:38:26,675
You?

552
00:38:31,254 --> 00:38:32,551
Does it matter?

553
00:38:32,622 --> 00:38:34,749
You quit looking
after me, remember?

554
00:38:38,228 --> 00:38:40,492
Would you happen
to have a line...

555
00:38:40,563 --> 00:38:42,190
on where
he might be?

556
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:46,726
l suppose
he's at the hotel.

557
00:38:46,803 --> 00:38:47,963
Which one?

558
00:38:48,037 --> 00:38:50,267
The outfit hotel.
They're all there.

559
00:38:51,441 --> 00:38:52,703
You got an address?

560
00:38:55,311 --> 00:38:57,176
We're friends, right?

561
00:38:57,247 --> 00:38:59,215
l mean, we used to be.

562
00:38:59,282 --> 00:39:02,877
But l'm an employee, too,
and l don't think the outfit...

563
00:39:02,952 --> 00:39:05,443
would like me telling you
where the hotel was, would they?

564
00:39:05,521 --> 00:39:07,318
No. What do you
think l'm gonna do?

565
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,618
How strong are you,
Porter?

566
00:39:08,691 --> 00:39:10,955
Personally, l think
you are the strongest man...

567
00:39:11,027 --> 00:39:12,289
l have ever met.

568
00:39:12,362 --> 00:39:14,523
But l wonder
if it's enough.

569
00:39:14,597 --> 00:39:16,121
For what?

570
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:17,666
lf l know you...

571
00:39:17,734 --> 00:39:20,032
you want this Resnick guy
for something he won't like.

572
00:39:20,103 --> 00:39:22,162
Yeah,
l'm gonna kill him.

573
00:39:25,475 --> 00:39:27,340
That's something
he won't like.

574
00:39:28,778 --> 00:39:31,747
What if something goes wrong,
and they grab you...

575
00:39:31,814 --> 00:39:34,009
and they ask you where you
found out about the hotel?

576
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,482
Why are we even
talking about this?

577
00:39:35,551 --> 00:39:36,950
You know l wouldn't
turn you in.

578
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,851
l wouldn't talk about
who told me what.

579
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:40,320
But what if they
ask you hard?

580
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:45,419
l'll--l'll tell them it was
a cab dispatcher named Stegman.

581
00:39:49,632 --> 00:39:52,430
The Oakwood Arms,
Union and 17th.

582
00:40:24,098 --> 00:40:25,258
Hi, Val.

583
00:40:27,735 --> 00:40:29,396
Where's my money?

[Ain't That A Kick ln The Head
By Dean Martin Playing]

585
00:40:35,176 --> 00:40:37,201
No, it's not there.
l took your gun.

586
00:40:37,278 --> 00:40:38,438
lt's back here.

587
00:40:38,513 --> 00:40:40,105
You look like a pro.

588
00:40:40,181 --> 00:40:41,808
You keep
your mouth shut...

589
00:40:41,883 --> 00:40:43,851
and you'll walk
out of here.

590
00:40:46,754 --> 00:40:49,188
My 70 grand--
l want it.

591
00:40:50,725 --> 00:40:53,319
l don't have it
right now.

592
00:40:53,394 --> 00:40:54,486
Where is it?

593
00:40:54,562 --> 00:40:58,623
l gave all 130,000
to the outfit.

594
00:40:58,699 --> 00:41:00,564
l gave it all to them.

595
00:41:00,635 --> 00:41:01,932
Well...

596
00:41:02,003 --> 00:41:05,700
tell them you gave them money
that doesn't belong to you...

597
00:41:05,773 --> 00:41:06,899
and get it back.

598
00:41:06,974 --> 00:41:08,771
Now, Porter,
l can't do that.

599
00:41:08,843 --> 00:41:10,640
l mean, you don't
know these guy--

600
00:41:10,711 --> 00:41:14,545
You're gonna kill me whether
l get the money or not.

601
00:41:15,716 --> 00:41:18,412
All right, l'll get it.
l'll get the money.

602
00:41:18,486 --> 00:41:20,454
Just give me a few days,
all right?

603
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:21,852
What the fuck
are you doing?

604
00:41:22,957 --> 00:41:26,154
Noon. Tomorrow.
Say it.

605
00:41:26,227 --> 00:41:27,251
All right.

606
00:41:27,328 --> 00:41:29,592
You know, this may
sound crazy, Porter...

607
00:41:29,664 --> 00:41:31,632
but, uh, no hard
feelings, huh?

608
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:34,293
l did what l had to do.

609
00:41:34,368 --> 00:41:35,926
You could appreciate that.

610
00:41:36,003 --> 00:41:37,470
Yeah, l appreciate that,

611
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:38,937
No, no, no. Don't.

00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:43,941

Noon.

be at the corner

628
00:42:49,744 --> 00:42:51,041
OK.

629
00:42:51,112 --> 00:42:52,579
OK.

630
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:55,946
Where'd you get this?

631
00:42:56,017 --> 00:42:57,177
Hmm?

632
00:42:57,251 --> 00:42:59,811
Some hooker had it
on her shelf.

633
00:42:59,887 --> 00:43:02,720
l recognized you. l swiped it
in case l could use it.

634
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:04,018
Did you hurt her?

635
00:43:04,091 --> 00:43:05,251
Huh?

636
00:43:05,326 --> 00:43:07,521
The hooker--
did you hurt her?

637
00:43:07,595 --> 00:43:09,460
What does that
have to do with anything?

638
00:43:18,506 --> 00:43:21,566
l've got a few minutes.

639
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:23,007
So go boil an egg.

640
00:43:26,547 --> 00:43:27,479
Uhh!

641
00:43:30,551 --> 00:43:32,951
Philip tells me
you have a problem...

642
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,453
you need help with.

643
00:43:34,522 --> 00:43:36,922
Yes, sir.

644
00:43:36,991 --> 00:43:39,357
ls it your problem who
breached our security...

645
00:43:39,427 --> 00:43:40,985
last night
at the Oakwood?

646
00:43:41,062 --> 00:43:42,529
Yes, sir. Ahem.

647
00:43:42,596 --> 00:43:44,325
Then he breaks
into my apartment--

648
00:43:44,398 --> 00:43:45,660
There's
an old expression...

649
00:43:45,733 --> 00:43:48,566
that has
served me well.

650
00:43:48,636 --> 00:43:50,968
''Do not shit
where you eat.''

651
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,866
Or ''live.''

652
00:43:53,941 --> 00:43:56,239
''Do not shit
where you live.''

653
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,437
Yeah,
l like that better.

654
00:43:58,512 --> 00:43:59,536
l'm sorry.
l'm sorry, Mr. Carter.

655
00:43:59,613 --> 00:44:02,514
There are 3 ways that
we can handle this.

656
00:44:02,583 --> 00:44:04,915
1--We can help you.

657
00:44:04,985 --> 00:44:07,317
2--We can allow you
to help yourself.

658
00:44:07,388 --> 00:44:10,755
And 3--We can
have you replaced.

659
00:44:15,796 --> 00:44:17,889
We have an investment
in you, Resnick...

660
00:44:17,965 --> 00:44:21,162
of time, money,
and training...

661
00:44:21,235 --> 00:44:24,432
so assisting you
would be, in a way...

662
00:44:24,505 --> 00:44:27,030
protecting
our investment.

663
00:44:27,108 --> 00:44:30,339
And that is always
good business policy.

664
00:44:30,411 --> 00:44:32,174
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, Mr. Carter.

665
00:44:32,246 --> 00:44:35,113
Thank you, sir.
You won't regret it.

666
00:44:35,182 --> 00:44:36,410
Now...

667
00:44:37,985 --> 00:44:39,316
according to Philip...

668
00:44:39,387 --> 00:44:42,322
a man has come to town
to kill you?

669
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:43,322
Yes.

670
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,722
And you say
that he's alone...

671
00:44:44,792 --> 00:44:46,726
and that he's
a professional robber...

672
00:44:46,794 --> 00:44:47,761
is that correct?

673
00:44:47,828 --> 00:44:49,728
Yes, sir. He does
payroll jobs, banks...

674
00:44:49,797 --> 00:44:51,128
you know, stuff like that.

675
00:44:51,198 --> 00:44:54,031
Mm-hmm.
What's his name?

676
00:44:54,101 --> 00:44:55,830
Porter.

677
00:44:55,903 --> 00:44:57,530
Well, what's
his first name?

678
00:45:02,977 --> 00:45:05,241
[Stammers]
You know, l don't know it.

679
00:45:05,312 --> 00:45:07,678
He never called himself
anything but Porter.

680
00:45:07,748 --> 00:45:08,942
[Laughs]

681
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,142
Mmm.

682
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,823
Where did you
get the $130,000?

683
00:45:27,301 --> 00:45:30,566
That's why this man
has come to town, huh?

684
00:45:30,638 --> 00:45:33,573
The $130,000
that you paid us back?

685
00:45:33,641 --> 00:45:36,371
Yes, sir, but only
70,000 of it was his.

686
00:45:36,444 --> 00:45:38,844
Well, we never asked you
where you got the money.

687
00:45:38,913 --> 00:45:40,972
lt's none of
our business...

688
00:45:41,048 --> 00:45:45,075
but now it appears it
has become our business.

689
00:45:45,152 --> 00:45:47,017
[Philip Clears
His Throat]

690
00:45:47,087 --> 00:45:49,783
Here's his file,
Mr. Carter.

691
00:45:57,932 --> 00:45:59,524
Do you understand
your value...

692
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,625
to the organization,
Resnick?

693
00:46:04,305 --> 00:46:05,465
You're a sadist.

694
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:07,803
You lack compunction.
That comes in handy.

695
00:46:09,743 --> 00:46:11,904
But now you've
allowed an area...

696
00:46:11,979 --> 00:46:15,176
of your personal life
to become a danger to us.

697
00:46:17,885 --> 00:46:20,718
A man in our organization
needs to be tough...

698
00:46:20,788 --> 00:46:23,222
and self-reliant.

699
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:28,353
Were you to handle
this problem on your own...

700
00:46:28,429 --> 00:46:30,897
there would be no doubt...

701
00:46:30,965 --> 00:46:33,559
that you're the kind
of man we want.

702
00:46:33,634 --> 00:46:35,431
l want to. Ahem.

703
00:46:35,503 --> 00:46:38,165
l want to handle it
myself, Mr. Carter.

704
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:39,934
Great.

705
00:46:40,007 --> 00:46:41,304
Until the matter
is handled...

706
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:45,675
l want you to move out
of the Oakwood Arms.

707
00:46:45,746 --> 00:46:48,681
Uh, ahem, but l don't
have a place, uh--

708
00:46:48,749 --> 00:46:51,513
l don't want anymore
unpleasantness at the hotel.

709
00:46:53,487 --> 00:46:55,011
Yes, sir.

710
00:47:03,097 --> 00:47:05,361
Excuse me for saying so,
Mr. Carter...

711
00:47:05,432 --> 00:47:08,333
but it might be easier
if Resnick just disappeared.

712
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:12,161
l thought about that...

713
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:14,799
but l'm not worried
about Resnick.

714
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:18,038
He wouldn't last 2 minutes
out on the street without us.

715
00:47:18,112 --> 00:47:20,376
lt's that other mutt
l'm thinking about.

716
00:47:20,447 --> 00:47:21,436
What's his name?

717
00:47:21,515 --> 00:47:22,539
Porter.

718
00:47:24,718 --> 00:47:27,209
Takes a lot of moxie to walk
right into the outfit...

719
00:47:27,288 --> 00:47:29,279
and start whacking
our guys around.

720
00:47:30,457 --> 00:47:32,470
Either that,
or he's shit nuts.

721
00:47:32,604 --> 00:47:36,973
Frankly, l don't understand it
for $130,000.

722
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:39,340
