00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,332
It is all gone!

3
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,668
Well, how can it possibly
be fucking gone?

4
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,082
There was 40 grand in there.

5
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,581
Yeah, eight months ago
there was 40 grand in there.

6
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:24,085
Eight months! How many
fucking scatter cushions do you need?

7
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,712
(Woman) Don't talk to me like I'm a cunt!

8
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,762
Baby? Are you all right?

9
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,759
It doesn't make sense.

10
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,978
I know!

11
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,646
You haven't worked
a single day for eight months.

12
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,327
Take the money for the Jacuzzi
out of the holiday dough.

13
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,406
I can't have it out of action
cos it's for my back.

14
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,827
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

15
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,417
Wake up, Jay!
There's no fucking holiday money!

16
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,502
And there is nothing wrong
with your back!

17
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,793
It's all in your fucking head.

18
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,432
(Motor sputters)

19
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,056
Fuck. Fucking...

20
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,105
Jay!

21
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,413
Ouch!

22
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,323
Jay!

23
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,957
Jay!

24
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,119
Oh!

25
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,455
Jay!

26
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,508
- 24 tins of tuna?
- Yeah, they were doing a deal.

27
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,253
Can you stop spinning?
You're doing my head in.

28
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,099
- You should've done me a list then.
- I did! It was on the fridge, you left it!

29
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,220
- 10 bottles of wine?
- You invited 'em.

30
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,346
What do you want to drink, Shel?
Herbal tea?

31
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,315
Oh, look, it says toilet roll
and it's underlined twice.

32
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:48,313
Oh, 197 pounds. And, no, you didn't
get any toilet roll, did you,

33
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,064
just, you know, loads of bottles of wine.

34
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,407
- That's good, Jay.
- I'll pop round the newsagents.

35
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,151
They'll have it, won't they?

36
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:59,323
(Sighs) You're in serious danger
of turning into a miserable cow, Shel.

37
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:02,998
I'm not going to sit here and have you
glaring at me for another half hour.

38
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,416
Sam? Sammy?

39
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,210
Babe, he's got loads of stuff.

40
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,083
- He doesn't need any more.
- It was four and a half quid, you wally.

41
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,209
He's got loads.

42
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,927
- En guard!
- Cool.

43
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,968
Daddy's promised
to do bedtime stories tonight.

44
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,974
Yeah, we can do that, mate.

45
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,643
(Agitated talking in Swedish)

46
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,241
(Shel sobs and continues
talking in Swedish)

47
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,673
(Intermittent sobbing and talking)

48
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,390
(Swedish conversation continues)

49
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,187
(Groans, shouts)

50
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,778
Get him! Come on, Sam!

51
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:36,129
(Jay) 'There were once
these two brave and honourable soldiers,

52
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,257
'and they were in charge
of guarding a man in a car.'

53
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,554
(Sam) I want a story about king Arthur.

54
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,645
(Jay) My story is better.
(Sam) No, it isn't.

55
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,314
Are you listening, cos you can go
straight to sleep without one?

56
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,978
What kind of car?

57
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,148
A bullet-proof one.

58
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,989
They were driving around this city,
you see.

59
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,199
What city?

60
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,695
Bagdadistan.

61
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:07,330
So there were these insurgents
and they made a bomb

62
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,078
and it blew up the Humvee
in front of the column.

63
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,830
It's not real though, is it?

64
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,832
No, not any more, no.

65
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,336
You shouldn't shout at Mummy.

66
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,057
Well, she started it, mate.

67
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,931
You are a bit lazy though.

68
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,142
- Who says?
- Mummy.

69
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,140
Does she now?

70
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,104
And me.

71
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,649
Do it, Daddy.

72
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,987
OK.

73
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:44,409
One, two, three...

74
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,496
Abracadabra.

75
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,466
Hi, how're you doing?

76
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:08,061
You're looking gorgeous as usual...
Ahh... please God

77
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,272
It's so good to see you. Hi.

78
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,605
- Fiona.
- Come on in.

79
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,350
- You?
- Yeah.

80
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,395
Canny wee tipple... your favourite?

81
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,363
(Fiona) Is that you?

82
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,575
Mmm! Swedish National service.

83
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,238
I didn't know they made girls do that!

84
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,328
Oh, they don't!
They don't, I wanted to do it.

85
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,493
Why should the boys
get to have all the fun, eh?

86
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,544
(Fiona) Here you both are...

87
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,879
- What uniform is that?
- Security assignment.

88
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,296
Is it dangerous?

89
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,670
In danger of getting your knickers
ripped off later, big girl.

90
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,297
(Chuckles)

91
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,478
The money's good.

92
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,310
The money's really good, Jay.

93
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,028
I can't.

94
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,278
Here.

95
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,365
Try one of these.
Blow your fucking head off.

96
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,367
I'm not eating anything red
at the moment.

97
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,795
- Does Shel know?
- What, about the diet?

98
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,463
No, about the job.

99
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,757
Might have mentioned something
in passing.

100
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,516
No wonder she's been
on my fucking back. Don't do that, Gal.

101
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,351
I wish someone would fucking clarify
the chain of command here.

102
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,891
- Who's wagging the dog?
- (Shel) Jay! Jay!

103
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,395
Coming.

104
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,358
That's cleared that up.

105
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,111
Fuck off.

106
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,328
We are done. Bon Appetit.
Tuck in, everyone.

107
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,822
(Gal claps) Well done.
(Fiona) Thank you.

108
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:50,947
Aww!

109
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,370
- This is beautiful.
- Thank you. It's not my worst.

110
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,914
- Army and Navy.
- Gravy?

111
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,879
(Gal) Your track record's good.

112
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,088
Dig in.

113
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:04,302
(Shel) And now... Cheers and welcome.
(Gal) Yeah, cheers. Here's to you.

114
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,592
- Lots of love.
- Cheers.

115
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,839
Thank you, thank you...

116
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,762
(Shel) Is there anything here
that you want, Fiona?

117
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,055
(Fiona) I'm really happy.
(Shel) You sure?

118
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,144
(Jay) What are these
little chef's hats about?

119
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,309
(Shel) I just thought...
you could pick them up with your fingers.

120
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,979
They're little Swedish chefs.

121
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,693
(imitates The Muppets' chef)

122
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,778
Who is gonna say Grace,
are you going to say Grace?

123
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,489
Oh, Stop.

124
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,574
- Not at my table.
- No?

125
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,489
No, no.

126
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,203
I could do it in Irish for you.

127
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,197
So what-what sort of...

128
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,825
Do you just sell anything? I don't...

129
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,165
No, it's kind of...

130
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:42,336
No, it's mainly...
sort of IT stuff and, you know.

131
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,300
It's commercial sales.

132
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,966
It's not like knocking on doors
and, you know.

133
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,510
- With a suitcase.
- Yeah, it's not flannels and tea towels.

134
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,929
(Laughter)

135
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,020
I know you would assume that
from Gal's accent, but...

136
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,855
It was all right, kinda,
when I was younger and stuff

137
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,316
and when we first
come out of the army.

138
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,654
But it's not, you know...
As Sam is getting older and stuff.

139
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,398
It's sort of difficult for him.

140
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,867
He wants his dad, you know.

141
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,111
So, you have to deal with that
while I am away, don't you?

142
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,909
I think it's hard on us.

143
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,578
Three months starts pushing it
we used to say.

144
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,952
- (Fiona) Three months?
- Sometimes, yeah.

145
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,500
- (Fiona) Wow.
- Bit like being a single mum.

146
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,547
- Can I just nip to the loo please?
- Mmm, course.

147
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,966
- It's just round the corner.
- OK, thanks.

148
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,840
(Jay) The lock's not great,
but we know you are in there,

149
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,139
so I don't think Sam will get
the shock of his life.

150
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,683
- Top up?
- Oh, yeah.

151
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,273
- I'll get it. I'll get it sit down, sit down.
- Sure?

152
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,518
- Old world, new world?
- Whatever you fancy, darling.

153
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,440
Whatever, mate.

154
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:49,067
Christ. You need a circular saw
to get through this meat.

155
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,906
Because you took the entire rack.

156
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,495
- I thought...
- I'd cut them all up, hadn't I?

157
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,410
I thought there was three big ones.

158
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,910
You could've said to me, darling.

159
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,582
Do you know what, unlike you,

160
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,798
I didn't want to embarrass you
in front of everyone.

161
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,212
As for this, what's all this game?

162
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,335
We've got every dinner set
and bit of cutlery known to man.

163
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,134
You've served the gravy
in a fucking Pyrex.

164
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,055
What's that about?
It's like a chemistry set.

165
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,142
(Gal's footsteps return)

166
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:28,363
(Gal) ls that all right?
(Shel) Yeah, that's my favourite.

167
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,907
So, what do you do, Fiona?

168
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,573
Hman resources

169
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,279
Hatchet man.

170
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,828
Sorry. Hatchet person.

171
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:44,249
What is it?
I mean what does that entail?

172
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,919
If there is a department
that is under-performing then...

173
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,840
I go in and assess
the extraneous manpower

174
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,429
and de-force accordingly...
I'm waiting for a comment!

175
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,923
(Laughter)

176
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:58,097
(Fiona) I know there is one coming.
(Jay) You sort of sack people?

177
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,224
It's not personal.

178
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,522
It is probably personal to them...

179
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,021
...and their families.

180
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,898
When was the last time you cared
about the welfare of a family?

181
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,401
Oh, yeah I know, eight months ago.

182
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:22,830
There's a bigger picture
in the business world.

183
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:30,129
Your picture doesn't stretch any further
than your front door, does it mate?

184
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,627
You mean the Jacuzzi.

185
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:38,592
I think the 80's recession
was a lot more glamorous.

186
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:43,062
No this is, this is much worse.
There's a lot of dirty work to be done.

187
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,604
I'll tell you one lot
who had no time for extraneous.

188
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,896
The Nazis.

189
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,234
Here we go.

190
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,605
I just wish
I could have had a go at them.

191
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,152
Difficult for a man to know
where he stands these days.

192
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,527
You should've had a crack
at the Mick, mate.

193
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,621
A tour of duty in Belfast
would've done you the world of good.

194
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,206
I've never understood
the whole Irish thing.

195
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,668
Cos, I mean,
it's all the same religion, so...

196
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,332
Not really, love.

197
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,294
They're all Christian.

198
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,969
- That's true.
- That's debatable.

199
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,008
What do I get? Fucking Iraq!

200
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,638
- Iraq's over. What about now, eh?
- Yeah?

201
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,147
I've finished.

202
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,982
Abracadabra!

203
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,118
(Jay, shouting) That's my fucking pal,
in front of my fucking pal.

204
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,457
(Shel) That's not just your fucking pal.
It's not just your fucking pal.

205
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,951
It's not just your fucking house, Jay!

206
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,749
(Gal) Come on, mate,
let's get you to bed.

207
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,046
(Shouting continues)

208
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,552
Don't you pay any attention to them,
they're just over excited.

209
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,768
why?

210
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,981
Because they've been drinking,
all right?

211
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,895
Don't you ever drink, do you hear me?

212
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,609
- Promise?
- Not even water?

213
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,103
Especially not that shit.

214
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,447
Do you know the government
puts stuff in it that shrinks your balls!

215
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,866
But you fall out with people, don't you?

216
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,657
You fall out with your mates, but then
you become friends again, don't you?

217
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,244
That's just what mummys
and daddys do sometimes.

218
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:29,120
That's why they're mummys and daddys
because they're best friends, you know?

219
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,917
Sometimes they fight,
sometimes the argue.

220
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,460
You know...

221
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,050
But it doesn't mean anything.

222
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,885
So, don't be worrying, all right?

223
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,932
Good lad.

224
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,239
Sorry.

225
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,911
(Fiona) No. Don't be silly.

226
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,674
How old's your boy?

227
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:20,386
- Sammy is seven.
- Oh.

228
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,755
You?

229
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,553
No. I never wanted any.

230
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,972
You'll change your mind.

231
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,808
No, I don't think so.

232
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,274
I love kids though...

233
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,650
He was the one, you know?

234
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,153
The love of your life?

235
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,821
No. The one who started it.

236
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,425
Knock. Knock.

237
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,429
Where?

238
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,261
Local, UK.

239
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,888
How many on the list?

240
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,524
Three. Not too strenuous.

241
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,664
How much?

242
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,836
Don't ask. Shel got it.

243
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,092
It's nice.

244
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,928
What do you think of Fiona?

245
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,014
Is she the one
you met at your sister's?

246
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,929
No, Boxercise

247
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,677
What?

248
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,896
Hey man, I tell you, a lot of tit women.

249
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,186
It relieves your sexual tension as well.

250
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,230
Fuck's sake.

251
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,399
Hey, don't knock it till you've tried, you.

252
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,692
She likes it rough then?

253
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,066
- Wouldn't you like to fucking know?
- I'm too old for that shit, so are you.

254
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,948
Yeah? Speak for yourself, granddad.

255
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,575
- Kiev was...
- Yeah, yeah... I know.

256
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,960
Listen man,
that was eight months ago.

257
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:20,833
You've got to get back on the horse again.
Do you know what I mean?

258
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,085
It's all right, it's all right.

259
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,473
The old team back together again.
The two musketeers!

260
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,140
We gonna do it?

261
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,599
Fucking get rid of that.

262
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,532
(Gal, whispering) Come on sweetheart.
Come on.

263
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,638
Are you OK? All right?

264
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,308
(Gal) The-y'll never find that body:

265
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:21,276
(Jay laughing) 'You could put
almost anything in front of it.'

266
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:26,322
It doesn't matter how disgusting it is

267
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:30,410
as long as you put that after it,
you're safe...

268
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,329
Fritzl could have got away with it.

269
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,991
It's OK, cos I don't have my gloves on.

270
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,874
Who'd have thunk it?

271
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,335
(I JOAN ARMATRADING:
"it Could Have Been Better")

272
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:56,724
J' I was very sad last night

273
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:01,316
J' You came by, I was so glad

274
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:08,862
J' Though sadness covered
the smile I kept for you

275
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:17,329
I I was waiting
for the cloud to pass over

276
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:23,626
I Then I could show my love...

277
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,840
I'm really sorry.

278
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:33,765
J' You could have made me laugh
if you'd stayed

279
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,475
J' But you left

280
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:44,898
I I was more confused
than I was before you came

281
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,816
J' I was frightened I

282
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,035
Cheers! I'll call you, all right?

283
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,909
- You're not driving, mate.
- I am once I find my fucking keys.

284
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,376
Shel, call a cab.

285
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,336
I'm all right man,
dry your eyes for fuck's sake.

286
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,707
- I'll drop the car for you in the morning.
- The fuck you will.

287
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,129
(Laughs) Why do you have
such a problem following orders?

288
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,342
Get your fucking hands off.

289
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,088
Listen, don't go behind my back
to her again!

290
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,096
Get the fuck off me, man!

291
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,227
You ripped my fucking jeans,
you cunt!

292
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,195
That's that shirt fucked.

293
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,038
Wha-hey, come on!

294
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:22,907
(Laughter)

295
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,631
Thank fuck that's over.

296
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,890
Babe?

297
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,101
Baby, come on back in,
it's getting cold.

298
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,856
Yeah, I'll be up in a minute.

299
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,947
(Rasping whisper) 'Wake up.

300
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,285
'Wake up.

301
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,700
'Wake up.'

302
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,744
Wake up.

303
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,077
Wake up.

304
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,423
- Wake up.
- No.

305
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,464
Not now!

306
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,184
Come here, I ain't gonna tickle you.

307
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:38,198
- I got you now. There is no escaping!
- (Giggles)

308
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,360
I'm sorry about last night.

309
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,374
I was being an idiot.

310
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,788
(Jay) Shel!

311
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,754
Shel!

312
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,594
Yep. No, that's no problem.
They'll be there.

313
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,180
- (Jay) Shel!
- What?

314
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,176
- Come out here!
- What is it?

315
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,099
Come out here and I'll show you.

316
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,099
No, you come in here.

317
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,646
Shel. Come out here, you lazy bugger.

318
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,661
That's the last time.

319
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,825
It's an offering, not an insult.

320
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,701
No. She's taking the piss.

321
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,621
It's a cat, it can't take the piss.

322
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,216
What is it?

323
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,211
Oh no, Jay!

324
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,012
It's a rabbit.

325
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,723
Put it in the outside bin.

326
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,810
Fuck am I. I'll cook it up
with some onion and garlic.

327
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,804
Not in my kitchen!

328
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,476
Oh, yeah.

329
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,980
Oh, just get rid of it, babe.

330
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,275
Smell of that.

331
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,952
What's Daddy doing?

332
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,038
Daddy's showing off.

333
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,328
What's he eating?

334
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,789
He's eating a rabbit.

335
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,463
Where from?

336
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,460
From the cat.

337
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,013
Daddy thinks the cat brings us
little presents.

338
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,727
The cat thinks we don't eat enough
in this house.

339
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,472
I just think the cat
likes killing rabbits.

340
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,586
(Bell tolls)

341
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,008
- Hey!
- (Gal) Who goes there?

342
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,346
(Laughs)

343
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,181
You all right?

344
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,435
- It was a good one last night, weren't it?
- Eh?

345
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,055
A good one last night.

346
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,897
- You reckon?
- Yeah.

347
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:19,610
- Nice food and all that.
- It had its moments.

348
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:27,118
Where's Fiona? Off de-forcing?

349
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,653
Fuck knows.

350
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,246
What?

351
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,617
I think I was
a bit of a bad boy last night.

352
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:41,006
I woke up this morning
with a 'Dear John' taped to my cock.

353
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,966
You're joking.

354
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,630
No.

355
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,886
Oh, mate.

356
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:56,514
Get your shit together,
the client's expecting us.

357
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,574
I like this car.

358
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,537
Looks nice but it's a dog on corners.

359
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,201
Here - better safe than sorry.

360
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,200
It's a bit over the top for a meeting, innit?

361
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,747
Do you know who's in there?

362
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,415
Cos I fucking don't.

363
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,063
You come with recommendations.

364
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,606
They're well earned.

365
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,818
Good.

366
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,605
Necessary.

367
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,901
Ah, fuck!

368
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,749
It's all right.

369
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,040
No, it's not.

370
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,301
I hear Kiev was stormy.

371
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,671
I'm in the process of rewriting it.

372
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,807
Good.

373
00:27:56,592 --> 00:28:00,597
It's important to learn
from one's mistakes, I always find.

374
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,237
Fuck, that was dramatic.

375
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,402
I'm bleeding on the carpet.

376
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:18,406
None of them ever say please or thank
you - that's what really fucks me off.

377
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,033
I mean, good manners cost nothing,
sure it doesn't.

378
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,832
How did he know about Kiev?

379
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,081
He was just letting you know
that he knows.

380
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,835
- What does that mean?
- Psychology, isn't it.

381
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,892
(G roans)

382
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,771
Fucking hell.
Is that your wanking hand?

383
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,607
- No.
- Hmm. Well, you know...

384
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,188
...every cloud...

385
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,483
- One of each?
- Take 'em yeah.

386
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,991
They say that's quite good.

387
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,611
I need to stop
and get a bandage or something.

388
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,080
Got to get through reception
without them noticing.

389
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:02,245
It's fucking swollen.

390
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,834
I'll walk on that side.

391
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:05,578
You stay on the left
and I'll walk on the right.

392
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,249
OK.

393
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,291
I could do with clearing up the sink
a little bit.

394
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,167
- Leave that to me, I'll do it.
- OK.

395
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,135
(Distant conversation)

396
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:46,160
Did you take one of those
this morning, babe?

397
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:49,664
Yeah, that's all right,
it's like six a day or something.

398
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,092
Handsome.

399
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,261
You going to be all right?

400
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,926
(Monkey whooping)

401
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,898
See you soon.

402
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,939
Back in the house - you'll get wet feet.

403
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,820
(Whispers) Go.

404
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,493
Bye.

405
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,049
I love this bit.

406
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,642
We're not going
to the fucking seaside, Gal.

407
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,232
Thank you.

408
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,277
Can you put your PIN in there, please?

409
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,907
Here on business?

410
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,993
- Crackers.
- Excuse me?

411
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,954
Novelty key rings. Paper hats.

412
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:07,291
Plastic fingernails. Doggy charms.

413
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,080
- They're my speciality.
- Sorry?

414
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,249
You wouldn't be, love, honestly.

415
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,839
You don't look like sales.

416
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,132
- Have the rooms got free Wi-Fi?
- No.

417
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:24,596
I'm afraid that card's been declined.
Let me just try that one more time.

418
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,309
Yeah, do.

419
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,055
I'll just ring for authorisation.

420
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,899
It's OK I'll get it.
Don't worry about it - I'll get it.

421
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,023
Hello, Shel?

422
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,567
Yeah, they just declined my card
at the hotel.

423
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,735
Yeah, they declined it.
No, there's no money in it.

424
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:46,159
One I look like a right mug,
and two it draws attention to me and Gal.

425
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,953
Straight away - who are these people
who can't afford to pay for the room.

426
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,702
- My name is Richard.
- (Receptionist) Nice to meet you.

427
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,374
Friends call me Dick.

428
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:56,214
(Jay) I can't believe
you haven't had ten minutes to do it.

429
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,299
You could have done it on your phone.

430
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,687
The soap's nice.

431
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,057
- Is it still in the wrapper?
- Yeah.

432
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:16,230
Nice. I fucking hate dirty soap.

433
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,355
So, what do you reckon?

434
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,948
Do the usual,
follow this guy around;

435
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,067
see what he gets up,
who he hangs out with?

436
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,694
What, do it properly, you mean?

437
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:30,950
Not just mow him down in a hail of bullets
like some Hackney crack head.

438
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,326
Yeah.

439
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,371
Yeah.

440
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,213
(Laughing)

441
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:43,674
He's 45 and lives
in 14 Coldwater Road.

442
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,015
If he's got a dog,
do we shoot the dog too?

443
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,679
Yeah, well...

444
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,178
Dogs are ten a penny,
aren't they?

445
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,283
I just wanted to say 'thank you'
to Justin.

446
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,874
His teachings have helped me put
everything in perspective.

447
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,744
I haven't had an anxiety attack
in three weeks.

448
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:16,961
Don't listen to them.

449
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:20,082
It's like a fucking worm
boring through my skull.

450
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:24,383
It's like a graveyard and they still
fucking plod up next to us.

451
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,346
(Justin) ...you could intersect
with the group

452
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:29,933
when I saw you having trouble
rationalizing your emotional response

453
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,643
to Duncan's departure.

454
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,478
I can't wait to see him rationalise
your emotional response.

455
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,563
- Don't.
- (Chuckles)

456
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,817
- I'm gonna kill 'em, Gal.
- Don't kill 'em, mate.

457
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,357
I am, I'm gonna massacre
that table of people now.

458
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,238
In a hotel.

459
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,653
I ain't gonna shoot 'em, Gal.

460
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:48,277
I'm going to do 'em one at a time
and do 'em slow.

461
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,199
- With a butter knife?
- Yeah.

462
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,290
(Group member) We should have a song.
We should have a song.

463
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:58,253
- A song... OK, shall I get the old guitar?
- Yeah, go on then.

464
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,168
Oh fuck, here we go.

465
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:03,171
You're expecting Jeremy Beadle,
aren't you?

466
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,795
- But he's dead, he can't help you!
- He's not going to play that guitar, is he?

467
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:13,894
J' Onward, Christian soldiers

468
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,763
J' Marching as to war

469
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,726
I With the cross of Jesus

470
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,354
J' Going on before...

471
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,152
(Gal) I even know this one.

472
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,027
I At the sign of triumph...

473
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:33,155
Look at 'em,
fucking happy bastards.

474
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:38,247
J' On then, Christian soldiers,
on to... I

475
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,996
You're giving me indigestion.

476
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,998
Oh, sorry.

477
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:44,879
Apology accepted.

478
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,134
Sometimes God's love
can be hard to swallow.

479
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,383
Not as hard as a dinner plate.

480
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,929
(Chuckles)

481
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,057
God loves you.

482
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,436
Does he?
Well, tell God from me...

483
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:04,607
If you're the kind of people he hangs
about with, stay out of my way.

484
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:09,908
No more guitar mate,
not in restaurants.

485
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,868
There is a time and a place.

486
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:16,115
And your time and place
is in a very isolated location

487
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,914
where no one is likely to be
for about a fucking hundred years.

488
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,332
OK?

489
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,706
Cos Jimmy Hendrix you ain't.

490
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,674
(Guitar smashes onto floor)

491
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:35,726
Very sorry about my friend,
please accept my most humble apologies.

492
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,595
And if you are speaking to the big man,
put a word in for us, will you?

493
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,017
Get them all a drink, love.

494
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,561
Double orange juices all round.

495
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,779
It don't look like
the house of a major villain, does it?

496
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:39,035
Oh, for fuck's sake,
a fucking priest! Brilliant!

497
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,032
You'll enjoy this one, Gal.

498
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:43,289
Yeah well, at least it's not a toddler.

499
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,162
What's he got there?

500
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:49,249
Oh, a new brief case.

501
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,321
You're worried.

502
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:19,992
Maybe.

503
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,958
He's probably shagging kids.

504
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,796
Might get you a pass
on all the other terrible shit you've done.

505
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,789
It's complicated.

506
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:35,132
As a parent I'd do them all,
even if I weren't getting paid.

507
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,972
Just for the record,
I've hardly done any terrible shit.

508
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,139
(Music plays over dialogue)

509
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:21,193
Turn round.

510
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,154
Thank you.

511
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,397
Why do you think he had that smile
on his face?

512
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,408
Probably at peace, you know.

513
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,739
Don't know how much at peace I'd feel

514
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,534
if I was getting a bullet
in the back of my head.

515
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,711
(Jay) 'Can you see me, yeah?'

516
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,998
(Shel on speaker)
'Yeah, sorry I just woke up.'

517
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,591
- 'Sorry.'
- 'No, it's fine!

518
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,506
'It's just... Sam was up in the night!

519
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:22,675
- 'Is he all right?'
- 'Oh yeah, he's fine.

520
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,889
'Bad dreams about the cat.

521
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,929
'How's your room?
I couldn't tell when I booked.'

522
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,472
Yeah, it's all right.

523
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,563
- 'On schedule?
- One down.

524
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,898
- 'Clean?'
- Yeah, course.

525
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,063
Don't worry, I'm all right.

526
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,061
'Babe, Fiona came round.

527
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,030
'With a present for Sam.'

528
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,070
That's a bit weird.

529
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,569
'I didn't like her at first,
but I don't mind her now.

530
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,491
'What do you think?'

531
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,582
- You could do with the company.
- 'Yeah, that's what I thought.'

532
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:55,002
- Don't let her anywhere near the garage.
- 'I'm not an idiot.

533
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,963
'I've got to go - Sam's calling, all right?'

534
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,547
- Do you miss me?
- 'Of course I do.

535
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,591
always.

536
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,463
'Love you.'

537
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,188
(Distant thunder)

538
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,565
(Gal) Looks like nothing this bloke.
(Jay) They all look like nothing, Gal.

539
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:03,780
He does look
like my uncle Terry though.

540
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,533
Uncle Terry, that's a new one.

541
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,697
(Laughs)

542
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:10,912
He wasn't a special uncle,
he actually was my uncle.

543
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,282
- Right.
- Yeah, he was a cunt.

544
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:16,910
He wasn't one of the people
your old man took money off of

545
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,457
to be your special uncle?

546
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:23,049
Oh, come on now. it's a family do.

547
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,835
Have you spoken to Fiona?

548
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,216
No.

549
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,762
She's been round at the house,
talking to Shel.

550
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:34,887
- Really? That's interesting.
- Yeah...

551
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,184
Says she's waiting.

552
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,938
What, for me?

553
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,942
Well yeah, I'd imagine so.

554
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,325
I'll leave her dangling a bit longer.

555
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,322
Do you know what I mean,
keep 'em keen, eh?

556
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:57,200
Gal, give her a ring.
I don't want some...

557
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:03,040
...glary eyed phantom kipping
in my front room when I get home.

558
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,587
Don't you dare
talk about my Fiona like that.

559
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,802
She's a good looking girl.

560
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:11,298
She's a bit of a fucking demon in bed
as well, I tell you.

561
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,140
- Yeah?
- Oh!

562
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,804
Fucking hell!

563
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,897
- Details?
- You know...

564
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,940
Put it this way, I had to shave
my pubes afterwards.

565
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:47,796
Gal?

566
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,761
What, are we off?

567
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,096
Right, we'll go and see
what is in that lock-up first.

568
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:04,605
Really?

569
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,859
I thought we were
just going to observe?

570
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,819
No, we are going to go
and have a look, mate.

571
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,989
Lovely... it's a wank den.

572
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,541
You don't get shot
for having a wank den.

573
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,794
Porn business?

574
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:11,793
There's not enough of it.

575
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,633
No, you're right.

576
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,551
(Scream on TV)

577
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,223
Fuck.

578
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:24,268
- Uh.
- What?

579
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,768
You don't want to fucking look
at that boy, I'll tell you.

580
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,987
Well, I've got to now, haven't I?

581
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:38,574
Fucking hell, mate.

582
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,540
(Screaming and wailing from TV)

583
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,054
(Screams) Help. Help!

584
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,302
(Glass breaks)

585
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,681
There's been a mistake.

586
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:08,274
Oh, yeah?

587
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:10,564
Mistaken identity.

588
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:14,610
Just remembered we're your burglars?

589
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,073
Really?

590
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,409
If you are, take what you want.

591
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,991
(Gal) I could do with some reassurance

592
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:24,241
that the world's
not full of murdering perverts.

593
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:25,787
We saw the lock-up.

594
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,043
- Christ.
- (Gal) Yeah.

595
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:31,877
(Gal) It's game on, big lad.

596
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:34,626
Yeah, don't bother. Fucking freak!

597
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,053
(Gal) Listen mate...

598
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,132
I've seen your wee film.

599
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:44,935
I'm just the librarian.

600
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,513
Who for?

601
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,229
This is not fair.

602
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,067
I'll show you 'not fair'.

603
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:56,651
Please.

604
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:01,619
Don't - because it makes me
hate you more, yeah?

605
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:03,283
Who films it?

606
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:08,873
I can't tell you that.

607
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,171
(Screams)

608
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,851
(Screams)

609
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:39,441
(Cries out)
He lives at Greenwold Street.

610
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,818
15 Greenwold Street.

611
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,663
Where do you keep your money?

612
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,289
- In the safe.
- Which room?

613
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,422
Top of the stairs on the right.

614
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,274
Does he know?

615
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,818
What?

616
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,064
Who you are.

617
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,401
He doesn't, does he?

618
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,242
What the fuck are you talking about?

619
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,833
Before he comes back...

620
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,621
...I just want to say...

621
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,380
...thank you.

622
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:43,091
For what?

623
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:46,762
(Whispers) I'm glad to have met you.

624
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,234
Nice.

625
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,080
I understand.

626
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,547
You have to do
what you have to do.

627
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,251
(Screams)

628
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:40,152
(Screaming continues)

629
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,071
Thank you.

630
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:52,410
Thank you.

631
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,588
You crazy fucking bastard.

632
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:06,220
Oh, fuck!

633
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:12,802
You can clean this fucking mess up
yourself, you know that?

634
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,474
Fine.

635
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:19,350
I'm getting a fucking bag.

636
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:25,527
(Jay) Let's nip round to that house
on Greenwold Street.

637
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:27,400
(Gal) Fuck that, you need
a long lie down, big lad.

638
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,744
I'm going to Greenwold Street
right fucking now.

639
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,909
- What the fuck is Shel gonna say?
- Then don't fucking tell her then.

640
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,577
Fuck!

641
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:38,661
You're well off list here, man.

642
00:50:58,097 --> 00:51:00,191
Right! Don't hang about.

643
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,654
If I'm not back in twenty minutes,
come and get me.

644
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,864
Don't you worry, I will.

645
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,807
Fucking first job in months
and he's gone off again, for fuck's sake.

646
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,358
(Shrill whistling)

647
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:17,904
Oh, for fuck's sake.

648
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,452
Jesus Christ.

649
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:26,829
(Whistling stops)

650
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:30,726
(Banging)

651
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:45,245
Was that twenty minutes?

652
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,242
Let's get the fuck out of here.

653
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,920
What the fuck are we going to do
with him now?

654
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:57,591
Brilliant. Fucking brilliant.

655
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,861
(Gal) You're covered in blood.

656
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,236
(Jay) I'll burn 'em.

657
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:21,452
They say the sign of a good painter
and decorator?

658
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:26,453
- What?
- Clean overalls. No bodging.

659
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,665
Point taken.

660
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:22,095
(Jay) It doesn't feel wrong.

661
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,848
They were bad people.

662
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,519
They should suffer.

663
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:38,358
I used to love looking at tires
when I was a kid.

664
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:02,776
Hi babe, I wasn't expecting you back...

665
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,108
- We haven't got any food.
- That's all right we'll go out.

666
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:07,701
Erm, it's a school night.

667
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,286
I just want to see Sammy, yeah?

668
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:12,828
No, he's on a play date, babe.
Can we talk about this later?

669
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,076
Hi Jay, you back?

670
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,953
(Shel) We've just had a glass of wine.

671
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:19,421
Yeah, and a moan.

672
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:25,335
- Do you want to join us?
- Er...

673
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,134
Yeah... I should get me...
all my bits and bobs.

674
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:32,597
- I should go.
- Oh no, don't be silly. You were here first.

675
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:34,971
No, stay. It's all right isn't it?

676
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:37,351
Yeah.

677
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,574
Shel!

678
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,911
Jesus, Jay!

679
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,920
(she-l) oh, God!

680
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,295
It's infected, babe.
You've got to go see a doctor.

681
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:08,966
I'm not going.

682
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,260
No...

683
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,309
I'll get some cream or something.

684
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:21,813
(Doctor) 'Would you say
you were suffering from stress?'

685
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,816
(Jay) 'Yes.'

686
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:28,691
'Do you experience fatigue? Nausea?'

687
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,409
Erm...Yes. No.

688
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,495
Why do you think that is?

689
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:39,493
Any particular reason?

690
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:43,797
No.

691
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:45,791
Professionally...

692
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:49,052
Some financial stuff.

693
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:54,512
I've got a family.

694
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:59,096
Now what about your sex life,
how's that?

695
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:00,723
Normal?

696
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:05,903
Listen, my wife said I had to come,
so you could look at my hand and...

697
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,236
You're fine!

698
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:13,326
Yeah, but my hand isn't.
Do you want to have a look at it?

699
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:16,367
Better still, I can give you some advice.

700
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,789
What happened to Dr Bapkin?

701
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,418
The past is gone.

702
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:28,379
The future

703
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,377
is not yet here.

704
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:34,802
There is only ever this moment.

705
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,603
(Shel's voice echoes) 'Jay!

706
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,777
'Jay!

707
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:40,413
LJay!l

708
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:47,337
Bloody...

709
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:54,669
Kids maybe?

710
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:57,968
Maybe gypsies.

711
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:04,471
You all right, sweetheart?

712
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:06,473
Someone's murdered the cat.

713
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,647
(Jay) Fucking loved that cat.

714
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:11,899
Didn't know.

715
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:14,940
No, neither did I till it happened.

716
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:18,614
- Look...
- What?

717
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:22,706
- It's a message, isn't it?
- Yeah, received loud and clear.

718
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:29,496
We lifted enough money the other night,
we could sack half this job off, man.

719
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:31,168
What?

720
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:34,672
There's pictures of us
outside the priest's house, Jay.

721
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:37,046
They've got a file on fucking Kiev.

722
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,140
- Where the fuck did they get that from?
- So fucking what?

723
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:42,430
Listen man,
let's just knock it on the head.

724
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,178
It's not doing your head any good and it's
fucking not doing mine any good either.

725
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,305
Yeah, I think you are right,
we should just give up.

726
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,149
We should let things like this happen
and not do fuck all about it.

727
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:53,441
We're doing a fucking job, man.
It's not a crusade, all right?

728
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:57,282
Right! Then you don't bother, but when
I start something, I fucking finish it, Gal.

729
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:58,446
Yeah I know, I know.

730
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:01,991
I've been standing around watching
how you fucking finish it.

731
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,456
- You're arsehole's gone, mate.
- Listen man.

732
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:08,042
I can't fucking work with you any more
if you're going to go fucking over the top

733
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,832
every time you get
a fucking lump hammer in your hand.

734
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:11,626
(Mockingly) Oh, I'm sorry, Gal.

735
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,670
I'm really sorry, mate.
I'm so sorry.

736
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,384
I'm really sorry.

737
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,094
- More?
- Listen, man!

738
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:21,135
You're going in there
like a fucking psycho on crack,

739
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:22,633
what the fuck's going on?

740
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:26,057
- Wait until you see me after this shit.
- Brilliant!

741
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:30,978
I'm going to go and bury my fucking cat
and you fuck off out of my gaff.

742
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,906
- (Gal) There, that's me done.
- What?

743
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:41,903
- Listen, I can't do this any more.
- No, no, Gal please? Please.

744
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,621
He needs to get help.

745
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:47,161
- I know.
- All right, listen. Don't cry.

746
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:49,626
- Don't cry.
- Thank you.

747
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,538
(Sobs)

748
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,010
Don't cry, please don't cry.

749
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,968
I'll call you.

750
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:25,991
We'll chat your mum up.

751
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,119
Get a puppy.

752
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:31,952
- OK.
- Yeah?

753
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:34,500
Has she gone to heaven?

754
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,926
I dunno, mate. Maybe.

755
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:44,051
Cat heaven.

756
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:53,437
You wanna talk to your uncle Gal really
about that side of things.

757
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:57,731
Come here.

758
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,034
Where have you been?

759
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,874
We went for a walk to look for foxes,
didn't we, mate?

760
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:14,119
- Dad said I could have a puppy.
- Did he?

761
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:16,121
Yeah, we're going to call it Arthur.

762
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:17,793
What if it's a girl?

763
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,791
Gwinny.

764
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,840
Hey you, young man, why don't you
go upstairs, get out of those dirties,

765
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:25,965
- and we'll have a bath in a minute, yeah?
- OK.

766
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:30,135
I don't want to talk about it.

767
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:33,639
Really? He's ready to walk.

768
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:37,437
Good! He's gone soft.

769
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:40,688
Wake up.
You wake up, fucking wake up!

770
01:05:47,569 --> 01:05:51,574
Do you think if you get replacements
they'll let you go free of the contract?

771
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,580
Is that what you want?

772
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:04,424
It doesn't look good,
but if we're compromised here...

773
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:32,868
We can get you top draw replacements.
They even look like us.

774
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:37,836
- It is your job.
- What if we say...

775
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:40,171
...fuck you very much and good night?

776
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:44,293
Then you die.
And your families, they die.

777
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,761
No wriggle room on that then?

778
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:50,556
No.

779
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:02,481
How long
have we been working for you?

780
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:05,822
- Please, don't embarrass yourself.
- I'm asking you a straight question.

781
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:08,942
I see you, what you are.

782
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:10,660
What are we?

783
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:13,280
- You're cogs.
- What?

784
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,365
What the fuck is this?

785
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,121
Reconstruction.

786
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:22,293
So, keep turning.

787
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:26,091
What do you mean by fucking
reconstruction?

788
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,086
Fuck off man...
Get your hands off me.

789
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,698
- What's this?
- I'm leaving.

790
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,329
What?

791
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:58,245
I'm taking Sam to the cottage,
just until the job's over.

792
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,122
You know you're in serious danger
of losing this.

793
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:06,169
Is that what you want?

794
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:07,713
No.

795
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:13,257
- Be good for mummy yeah?
- Yes.

796
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:16,221
OK, watch your head, watch your head.

797
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:31,524
Turns out he's an MP.

798
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:35,286
Is that more acceptable
than a priest?

799
01:08:35,403 --> 01:08:37,280
I can't say I'm not relieved.

800
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:41,788
Well, his name's on the list.

801
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:44,253
- That's all that matters.
- OK.

802
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:47,374
You sure?

803
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:49,751
You don't want to go and have
a little cry about it to Shel?

804
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:53,297
I might do if I could find her.

805
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:54,968
She's gone on holiday.

806
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,717
That's funny, she never mentioned
anything to me.

807
01:08:57,842 --> 01:09:01,187
That's funny. I don't really understand
why you're calling my fucking wife, mate,

808
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:02,430
I'll be honest with you.

809
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:05,479
- Right, you're her husband, aren't you?
- Yeah, leave this now, Gal.

810
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,147
No.

811
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:09,236
You shouldn't fucking treat your wife
like a doormat.

812
01:09:09,354 --> 01:09:10,901
- All right. Thanks.
- Know what I mean?

813
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:13,775
She's a lovely wee woman,
and you treat her like a fucking mug.

814
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,494
All your relationships
have been so very successful, Gal,

815
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:19,330
so thanks very much for your advice,
you cunt.

816
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:22,166
Oi! What the fuck was that? Fucking...

817
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:27,205
Not in the face, fuck!

818
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,207
Not in the fucking face.

819
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:36,509
(Glass breaks)

820
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:56,363
I'm telling Shel you started it.

821
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:58,031
She thinks I'm a saint.

822
01:09:58,486 --> 01:10:00,363
She doesn't know you.

823
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,499
I'll go get a new one.
She won't even notice.

824
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,917
She notices everything.

825
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,884
I can't get that Fiona
out of my head, you know.

826
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,503
- Really?
- Yeah, I think it might be love.

827
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:19,178
- You don't really know her, Gal.
- Yeah well, you know.

828
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:22,177
These things happen
like that some times.

829
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:26,890
She gaffer-taped your cock.

830
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:29,517
I'm putting that down
as an erotic cry for help.

831
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:35,281
I can't remember
what I was like before Shel.

832
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:39,076
Probably a lonely fucker, like me.

833
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,614
They say there's someone
for everyone, mate.

834
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:45,288
Yeah, it's not much to ask, is it?

835
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,921
Right, let's go and kill this MP then.

836
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:55,588
Yeah.

837
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,774
(Heavy clang)

838
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:15,738
- Got it?
- Yeah.

839
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:25,035
(Helicopter approaches)

840
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:27,033
- Did you hear that?
- What?

841
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,706
- Chopper?
- Don't know.

842
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:36,801
The air's good.

843
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:38,761
Yeah, we should do this more often.

844
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,425
What, kill rich people?

845
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:42,014
No, get out in the fresh air.

846
01:12:08,783 --> 01:12:10,330
Dinner's on me.

847
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:16,628
Do you want a cup of tea?

848
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:20,048
Yeah, lovely.

849
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,298
We'll go down and have a look
at his gaff tomorrow.

850
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,220
What's the plan?

851
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,639
I can't be bothered with anything flash.

852
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,013
So we're not just gonna drag him
down to the village square

853
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:32,231
and chop his head off
with a fucking axe?

854
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:34,351
Eh?

855
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:38,525
Leave it till two or three, then.

856
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,782
Let's go down and get an idea
of the layout of the house.

857
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:46,283
You look right at home.

858
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,165
The two musketeers, eh?

859
01:12:49,991 --> 01:12:52,790
J' Oh Mr Bunny, it's gonna get cold

860
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:55,333
J' I'm taking your coat off your back

861
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:58,333
J' Hey Mr Bunny, what do you think?

862
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:00,130
I What do you think about that? I

863
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,838
(Gal) That's not right.

864
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:05,510
(Jay) What?

865
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,508
One man living in all that.

866
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:11,308
None of it's right, Gal.

867
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:13,643
That's why we're here.

868
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:18,819
(Gal) Come on, let's bed down.

869
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:21,610
He's probably
fucking the scullery maid anyway.

870
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,783
Gal.

871
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:32,579
Gal.

872
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:39,632
You awake?

873
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:43,628
Well, I wasn't, but I am now.

874
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,968
What?

875
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:54,893
L.m

876
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:58,727
...really sorry about that stuff.

877
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:01,813
Yeah, I know.

878
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:06,902
I don't know where it comes from.

879
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:11,747
Listen, you're a fucking madman,

880
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:14,367
but you're my best mate
and I love you, so...

881
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:17,203
Let's just leave it at that, eh?

882
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:20,960
Cheers.

883
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:54,494
(Slow, steady drumbeat)

884
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:56,117
Gal?

885
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,088
- Gal?
- What?

886
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:03,458
What the fuck? What?

887
01:15:04,959 --> 01:15:06,836
(Drumbeat continues)

888
01:15:27,314 --> 01:15:30,864
Get your shit together - lively.

889
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,798
(Distant thunder)

890
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:20,572
(Pulsing drumbeat)

891
01:18:26,827 --> 01:18:28,704
(Hammering accompanies drumbeat)

892
01:18:30,581 --> 01:18:32,458
(Beating stops)

893
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:44,891
- There's too many of them, man. Don't!
- Fuck this.

894
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:47,059
Jay!

895
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:01,912
(Shrieking)

896
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:18,129
(Hurried footsteps)

897
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,302
(Door clangs)

898
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:34,482
Fuck it, come on.

899
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,403
(Jay) Are you sure
you know where we are?

900
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:40,902
Yeah, yeah, I am.

901
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,368
- VVhat's wrong?
- Shush.

902
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:50,377
Come on.

903
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,884
Fuck! It's been bricked up.

904
01:20:05,009 --> 01:20:07,637
- It wasn't supposed to be here...
- I thought you'd fucking scouted!

905
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:09,855
It wasn't supposed to be here, man.

906
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:36,544
(Shrieking)

907
01:20:46,216 --> 01:20:48,059
They are coming
from the other way, Gal.

908
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:52,814
Jay!

909
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,049
(Shrieking)

910
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:22,885
(Thumping)

911
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:37,184
Jesus Christ.

912
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:48,078
Jay?

913
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:50,322
Jay?

914
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:51,664
(Shrieking)

915
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:02,464
(Knife is unsheathed)

916
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:21,232
(Shouts) Gal?

917
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:24,652
Gal?

918
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:28,702
(Howling reverberates around)

919
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:40,957
(Jay) C'mon mate. Jesus,
let's get you out of here mate.

920
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:42,628
(Gal) I can't move mate,
they've slashed...

921
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:44,626
They've slashed my fucking legs.

922
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:46,253
(Groaning)

923
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:04,278
(Jay) We've got to go.

924
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:05,943
Come on, please get up.

925
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:07,942
I'm done, mate.

926
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:09,443
Fuck.

927
01:23:14,364 --> 01:23:15,991
Gal, we've got to, mate.

928
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,962
Tell Shel I'm sorry, will you?

929
01:23:21,622 --> 01:23:23,624
Just do it, do it.

930
01:23:35,636 --> 01:23:37,764
I'm sorry.

931
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:38,935
Thanks.

932
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:14,262
(Jay) It's all over.

933
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:17,978
(Sobs)

934
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,605
Can we go home now?

935
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:28,318
(Sam) Is he sick?
(Shel) Tired, very tired.

936
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:33,444
Shall we take you back to bed?

937
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,219
Get down.

938
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:07,482
Make sure Sam is all right
and turn the lights off upstairs.

939
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:09,480
- Let's leave, babe.
- No, we can't go anywhere.

940
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:11,357
They've slashed
the fucking tyres.

941
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:13,028
What the fuck is that?

942
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:18,288
It's too noisy!

943
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:20,741
Just fireworks.

944
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:31,339
I don't think there are many of them...

945
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:39,885
Listen, I'm going out there
to find them, yeah? Take that.

946
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:49,565
I love you, yeah.

947
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:36,233

948
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:44,617

951
01:26:57,254 --> 01:26:58,551
(Muffled gunshots)

952
01:26:58,672 --> 01:27:00,219
(Footsteps cease)
