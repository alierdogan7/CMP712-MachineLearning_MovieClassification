1
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:33,376
<i>Cell?</i>

2
00:00:35,018 --> 00:00:36,747
<i>Prison cell?</i>

3
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:39,613
<i>How'd I get here?</i>

4
00:00:40,757 --> 00:00:43,123
<i>What do you want, son?</i>

5
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:51,233
Walker, let's get out of here.
I want to talk to you.

6
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:54,262
I want to talk to you. It's important.

7
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,601
Come on, Walker! Come on!

8
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:03,004
- Now you listen to me!
- Hey.

9
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,477
I need your help!

10
00:01:04,547 --> 00:01:07,072
Don't you understand? I need your help!

11
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,242
What are you doing?

12
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,487
<i>Walker, they use the prison.</i>

13
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:16,650
<i>You know, it's closed.</i>

14
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:18,383
<i>We just wait.</i>

15
00:01:18,862 --> 00:01:20,557
<i>We wait till they get it.</i>

16
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,962
<i>And then we take it from them.</i>

17
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:27,999
You take the stuff, I'll get the lights.

18
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:31,403
<i>You're my friend, Walker.</i>

19
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,067
<i>I can't make it on my own.</i>

20
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,603
<i>Help, my friend.</i>

21
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:39,148
- Trust me! Please!
- What are we doing here?

22
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:40,606
Help me!

23
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,048
I hear it.

24
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,811
Early.

25
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:46,718
Hit them!

26
00:01:58,334 --> 00:01:59,995
<i>I owe a bundle to some guys, Walker.</i>

27
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:02,162
<i>They're going to kill me if I don't get it.</i>

28
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:04,866
They're going to kill me if I don't get it!

29
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:29,962
<i>We just hit them on the head, that's it.</i>

30
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:32,228
It's simple,
we just knock them on the head.

31
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,790
It's my show, Walker!

32
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,025
- We made it.
- We blew it!

33
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:08,035
<i>We blew it.</i>

34
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:12,072
And? $20s?

35
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:15,076
$24,000. $2,000 in $20s.

36
00:03:15,144 --> 00:03:16,475
Come on, let's get out of here.

37
00:03:16,546 --> 00:03:18,844
Will you shut up? I'm trying to count!

38
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,274
You coming, Lynne?

39
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:26,248
The boat won't be here for an hour.

40
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,014
Lynne?

41
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,993
- Darling?
- It's not as much as I thought.

42
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:36,059
Is it less than we need?

43
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:41,364
You'd better take care of your husband.

44
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:46,639
How'd we get into this mess?

45
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:53,546
I don't know.

46
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,306
Lynne...

47
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:25,344
come here.

48
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,894
Take me away.

49
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,609
<i>Did it happen?</i>

50
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:58,310
<i>A dream?</i>

51
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:01,276
<i>A dream.</i>

52
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,457
<i>As we get closer to Alcatraz...</i>

53
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:59,767
<i>notice the treacherous currents</i>
<i>around the island...</i>

54
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,031
<i>rendering it virtually escape-proof.</i>

55
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:06,037
<i>The water temperature is usually</i>
<i>around</i> 5<i>0 degrees.</i>

56
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:09,711
<i>In its</i> 2<i>9 years as a federal penitentiary...</i>

57
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,675
<i>the one thing that obsessed its prisoners</i>
<i>and plagued its wardens was escape.</i>

58
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:18,182
<i>In</i> 1<i>9</i>36<i>, the first escape attempt...</i>

59
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:20,916
<i>was made by a prisoner</i>
<i>who was almost into the Bay...</i>

60
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,719
<i>before he was discovered.</i>

61
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:27,157
<i>In</i> 1<i>9</i>37<i>, two prisoners</i>
<i>actually got o</i>ff <i>the island.</i>

62
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,560
<i>Because of the dense fog</i>
<i>and strong tides...</i>

63
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:33,261
<i>it's assumed</i>
<i>that they were washed out to sea.</i>

64
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:35,933
<i>There has never been</i>
<i>a trace of them found.</i>

65
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:38,473
<i>On</i> J<i>une</i> 12<i>,</i> 1<i>9</i>62...

66
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:43,571
<i>three men dug their way</i>
<i>out of the cellblock using small teaspoons.</i>

67
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,046
<i>They left dummies, which they had</i>
<i>created, in their cells...</i>

68
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:48,913
<i>and managed to get o</i>ff <i>the island.</i>

69
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:51,044
<i>They have never been heard of since.</i>

70
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,985
How did you make it, Walker?

71
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,750
<i>In</i> 1<i>9</i>46...

72
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:57,949
<i>the historic Battle of Alcatraz took place.</i>

73
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:01,824
<i>Two convicts had managed</i>
<i>to overpower their guards...</i>

74
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:03,899
<i>and took over the main cellblock...</i>

75
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:07,094
<i>releasing those prisoners</i>
<i>still in their cells.</i>

76
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,365
<i>They had nine hostages.</i>

77
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:11,833
<i>During the two days of siege,</i>
<i>the Coast Guard...</i>

78
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,500
Using the Rock...

79
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:16,542
for a drop.

80
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:18,606
Fuzz?

81
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:21,311
I'm Yost.

82
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,550
- Are you making a charge?
- No.

83
00:08:27,056 --> 00:08:28,250
I want something else.

84
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:29,621
<i>... a utility corridor...</i>

85
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:33,093
<i>that the police riddled</i>
<i>with rifle and shotgun fire.</i>

86
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:35,823
<i>After the</i> 48<i>- hour break...</i>

87
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:38,765
<i>two o</i>ff<i>icers</i>
<i>and three prisoners were dead.</i>

88
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:42,535
I want the Organization.

89
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:43,798
Excuse me.

90
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:45,670
<i>The last escape attempt from Alcatraz...</i>

91
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:47,504
Your friend Reese...

92
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:50,206
he's in the big time now.

93
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,213
Come on, dear.

94
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,407
Suits.

95
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:57,383
Penthouses.

96
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:01,552
He bought his way back in...

97
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:08,660
with the money he stole from you.

98
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:10,062
<i>... never heard from again.</i>

99
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,727
<i>And all indications point</i>
<i>to their being swept with the tide...</i>

100
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,772
<i>out through the Golden Gate</i>
<i>to a watery grave.</i>

101
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:21,035
<i>Alcatraz, often called 'the Rock, '</i>
<i>was actually...</i>

102
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,805
$93,000, wasn't it?

103
00:09:23,946 --> 00:09:25,174
$93,000.

104
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,315
You want Reese...

105
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,316
and I want the Organization.

106
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:34,754
<i>Workmen were supposed</i>
<i>to establish a lighthouse...</i>

107
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,018
You understand?

108
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:38,652
<i>... to a</i>ff<i>ord protection to ships</i>
<i>and small vessels...</i>

109
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:41,720
I'm going to help you.
And you're going to help me.

110
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:44,095
<i>The island was eventually sold...</i>

111
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,691
That's your wife's address in Los Angeles.

112
00:09:46,802 --> 00:09:48,633
<i>... for the sum of</i> $5<i>,000...</i>

113
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:50,729
Reese lives there, too.

114
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:55,537
<i>In</i> 1854<i>, the United States Army</i>
<i>began to fortify Alcatraz.</i>

115
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,701
Walker, Reese isn't here.

116
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:06,105
He's gone.

117
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,977
Three months ago.

118
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,643
Gone. Cold.

119
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,876
Moved out.

120
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:17,579
Walker?

121
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:20,522
I'm glad you're not dead.

122
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,290
It's true. I really am.

123
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,352
You ought to kill me.

124
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:30,031
I can't sleep.

125
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,265
Haven't slept.

126
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,761
Keep taking pills.

127
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,097
Dream about you.

128
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:41,442
How good it must be...

129
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,476
being dead.

130
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:46,241
Is it?

131
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:49,543
No.

132
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:51,684
No, I can't.

133
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,884
Never had the courage.

134
00:12:58,994 --> 00:13:00,154
This?

135
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,254
Payoff, I guess.

136
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:08,601
I don't know where he is, I really don't.

137
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:18,206
Money?

138
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:22,550
A guy brings it the first of every month.

139
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:24,647
$1,000.

140
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:32,527
Always a different guy.
No contact with Mal.

141
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,261
Just couldn't make it with you, Walker.

142
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,728
With him, it was...

143
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:46,140
kind of fun.

144
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:49,936
Just drifted into it.

145
00:13:52,882 --> 00:13:55,248
That night on Alcatraz...

146
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,183
I knew it was you I really wanted.

147
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,248
I found out too late.

148
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,532
<i>Do you remember...</i>

149
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:21,899
<i>when we met?</i>

150
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,707
<i>The rain?</i>

151
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,322
<i>You were a little drunk.</i>

152
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:42,458
<i>So was I.</i>

153
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,600
<i>You were funny when you were drunk.</i>

154
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,369
<i>Strange.</i>

155
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:56,872
<i>I don't remember very much, but...</i>

156
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,811
<i>suddenly...</i>

157
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,674
<i>we were together.</i>

158
00:15:03,686 --> 00:15:05,551
<i>It was wonderful at first.</i>

159
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:09,422
<i>I loved you.</i>

160
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,654
<i>Then Mal happened.</i>

161
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,430
<i>You talked a lot about Mal.</i>

162
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:23,034
<i>Mal Reese.</i>

163
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,162
<i>He was very real for me.</i>

164
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,639
<i>Until I met him.</i>

165
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:29,444
<i>That night at the reunion...</i>

166
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,213
<i>when you found Mal again</i>
<i>and brought him home.</i>

167
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:39,414
<i>The two of you together.</i>

168
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:43,489
<i>Then, it was the three of us...</i>

169
00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:45,488
<i>laughing.</i>

170
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:47,556
<i>It was...</i>

171
00:15:49,632 --> 00:15:51,099
<i>It was perfect.</i>

172
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:53,961
<i>And...</i>

173
00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:58,271
<i>I think I was happier then</i>
<i>than any other time.</i>

174
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:00,905
<i>I seemed to be floating...</i>

175
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:02,603
<i>between the two of you.</i>

176
00:16:03,612 --> 00:16:05,978
<i>Suddenly, I began to drift toward Mal.</i>

177
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:10,279
<i>And I just went with it.</i>

178
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,218
<i>Lynne...</i>

179
00:21:53,795 --> 00:21:55,092
<i>come here.</i>

180
00:22:02,838 --> 00:22:05,306
Come on, I've got something nice for you.

181
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,209
Hey, who... Listen...

182
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:21,956
Only Miss Walker, they said.

183
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,124
- I got to call them.
- You got to call them?

184
00:22:26,795 --> 00:22:29,787
- No, I can't.
- You can't?

185
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:31,957
Because they'll kill me.

186
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:33,592
They'll kill you?

187
00:22:33,668 --> 00:22:36,136
- Big John will kill me.
- Big John?

188
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,870
John Stegman. Big John's Car Lot.

189
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,932
This guy's got a car lot.

190
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:45,407
Stegman.

191
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:49,441
- What's the dog's name?
- Lola.

192
00:22:49,518 --> 00:22:51,145
- Lola?
- Yes, she is a girl.

193
00:22:51,219 --> 00:22:53,847
The dog's name is Lola?
What's your name?

194
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,415
Miss Stewart.

195
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,152
Miss Stewart,
what do you think of this car?

196
00:22:58,226 --> 00:22:59,386
I like it very much.

197
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,485
- It's a good buy.
- Yes.

198
00:23:00,562 --> 00:23:03,656
A one-owner car, a lady from Beverly Hills
who drove it carefully.

199
00:23:03,732 --> 00:23:05,165
- Mr. Stegman?
- Yes, sir.

200
00:23:05,233 --> 00:23:06,825
An old lady from Beverly Hills?

201
00:23:06,902 --> 00:23:08,130
That's me.

202
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,335
I'm looking for a car.

203
00:23:10,405 --> 00:23:13,033
Take your pick, friend.
What have you got in mind?

204
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:14,541
What about that model?

205
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:15,803
What'd you say?

206
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:17,538
- It has power steering.
- Yes.

207
00:23:17,612 --> 00:23:19,102
What about this one?

208
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:21,678
Beautiful car.

209
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,913
It costs a lot of money.

210
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,612
I've got a lot of money.

211
00:23:25,687 --> 00:23:29,384
Why does every pretty girl think so?
By the way, I'm giving the car away.

212
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,789
What kind of a car do you want?

213
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:32,451
Did somebody recommend you?

214
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:33,892
Mal Reese.

215
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:36,089
We're asking $2,950 for this one...

216
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:39,656
- Good. You want to take a spin?
- Okay.

217
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,263
I think I would...

218
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,773
Aren't you going to introduce this lady
to your boss?

219
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,901
Yes, sir. This is my boss.

220
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:52,140
- Well, hello.
- How do you do? Glad to meet you.

221
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:57,108
You ready to go for a little spin?

222
00:23:58,086 --> 00:24:00,111
- She's already committed herself.
- Where?

223
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,379
Anywhere you say.

224
00:24:01,456 --> 00:24:02,718
See the scenery.

225
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:05,259
- Let's go to the beach.
- Great.

226
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:06,451
Why don't you go with us?

227
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,326
I've got something to do.
I'll be back in about 20 minutes.

228
00:24:09,397 --> 00:24:10,455
- Good.
- For sure?

229
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,624
Don't go away.

230
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,634
Don't worry.
I won't do anything you won't.

231
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,693
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

232
00:24:21,977 --> 00:24:23,171
Fallen in love?

233
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:25,304
Yeah. Pretty nice rig, huh?

234
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,812
You don't really need that.

235
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,918
Most accidents happen
within three miles from home.

236
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:34,148
True.

237
00:24:34,456 --> 00:24:36,151
What do you want for it?

238
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:39,992
See if you like it,
and we'll work out a deal. Okay?

239
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:46,126
Most people like that headliner.
They kind of flop over.

240
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:49,637
Take a look right up that line.
Picture yourself behind that wheel.

241
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:52,602
Mind if I hear my commercial?

242
00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:54,141
No, go right ahead.

243
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,137
- Stereo. Pretty good, huh?
- Yeah.

244
00:24:58,313 --> 00:25:00,474
How's the power steering work?

245
00:25:00,815 --> 00:25:02,407
Get it over.

246
00:25:03,718 --> 00:25:05,049
Are you crazy?

247
00:25:09,024 --> 00:25:11,857
- Where can I find Reese?
- What's he got to do with this?

248
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,121
What're you doing to my car?

249
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:14,560
What I did to your delivery boy.

250
00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:16,688
- What are you talking about?
- You know. Tell me!

251
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,029
I can't tell you!

252
00:25:22,737 --> 00:25:23,863
Stop it.

253
00:25:44,226 --> 00:25:45,454
Who the hell are you, anyway?

254
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:47,654
My name's Walker. Where do I find Reese?

255
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:49,856
I've got nothing to do with Reese!

256
00:25:56,171 --> 00:25:58,969
I know about you, Walker.
How's your wife?

257
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:05,042
- She's dead.
- And her sister?

258
00:26:05,113 --> 00:26:06,808
Chris? What about her?

259
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,890
She's with Reese now!
He nailed both sisters.

260
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:22,992
How does that grab you?

261
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:24,360
Where's Reese?

262
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,568
<i>Big</i> J<i>ohn loves cars. Come on in.</i>
<i>Pay us a visit.</i>

263
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:31,663
Get up.

264
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,401
<i>... four-door sedan and only...</i>

265
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:34,737
Where's Chris?

266
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,775
She runs a club.

267
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:39,370
A place called the Movie House.

268
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,779
<i>You'll love my guarantee.</i>

269
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,514
<i>Come on in to Big</i> J<i>ohn's Car Lot.</i>

270
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:48,283
<i>Remember, Big</i> J<i>ohn loves cars.</i>

271
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:52,258
<i>You'll love my guarantee.</i>
<i>You'll love my cars at Big</i> J<i>ohn's.</i>

272
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,399
Did I exaggerate?

273
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:38,897
- He did that, huh?
- With me in it.

274
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,869
- You sure it was him?
- It was him.

275
00:27:41,943 --> 00:27:44,503
- Tall? Big man?
- I know him, Mal.

276
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,680
- You didn't tell him anything?
- I didn't tell him anything.

277
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,084
Would I tell him anything?

278
00:27:53,154 --> 00:27:55,088
You're sure you told him nothing?

279
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:57,556
This says I didn't.

280
00:27:57,625 --> 00:28:00,287
- Then why didn't he kill you?
- He killed the car.

281
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:02,057
You didn't give him something?

282
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,496
- A name?
- I told him you were in Frisco.

283
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:07,532
Smart boy.

284
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:11,300
Just don't hold out on me.

285
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,571
You can trust me, Mal.

286
00:28:16,177 --> 00:28:19,237
You had him and you let him go.
Find him again.

287
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,648
- Find him?
- I don't care how you do it. Just do it.

288
00:28:23,184 --> 00:28:25,618
- Mal, come on.
- Shut up.

289
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:28,883
Now, you find him.

290
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:30,952
And you finish him.

291
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:29,016
How are you, Sandy?

292
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:31,142
Walker, are you still alive?

293
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:33,048
Are you?

294
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,961
Where's Chris?

295
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:47,600
She's off tonight.

296
00:29:48,236 --> 00:29:50,397
Write down her address for me, huh?

297
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,230
Thought I'd see you.

298
00:29:54,909 --> 00:29:55,967
Why?

299
00:29:56,578 --> 00:29:59,069
Some guy. Asking for you.

300
00:30:04,586 --> 00:30:06,781
Is there another way out of this joint?

301
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:08,254
Back of the stage.

302
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:13,750
Sandra, see you around, huh?

303
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,624
Do come.

304
00:33:38,332 --> 00:33:39,424
Walker?

305
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,532
Where's Reese?

306
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:50,742
You're supposed to be dead.
Lynne said so.

307
00:33:50,812 --> 00:33:52,074
She's dead.

308
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:54,603
Lynne?

309
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,542
- You?
- No. Her.

310
00:33:58,886 --> 00:34:00,877
- Those.
- I'm not sleeping.

311
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,921
I heard you're running with Reese.

312
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:06,584
Well, you heard wrong.

313
00:34:06,928 --> 00:34:08,293
Does he want you?

314
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,021
- Sure he does.
- Do you want him?

315
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,191
He makes my flesh crawl.

316
00:34:14,268 --> 00:34:15,428
I want him.

317
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,630
You were always the best thing
about Lynne.

318
00:34:20,942 --> 00:34:22,569
Why don't you want him?

319
00:34:25,513 --> 00:34:27,606
I don't want any of them.

320
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,177
I was going with a guy.

321
00:34:32,386 --> 00:34:34,354
Owned a club, jazz club...

322
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:35,719
Yeah, the Movie House.

323
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,382
It was different then.

324
00:34:39,227 --> 00:34:41,195
It was a good jazz club.

325
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,363
The Organization wanted to...

326
00:34:44,198 --> 00:34:46,223
become his partner.

327
00:34:49,036 --> 00:34:50,401
- And?
- And, he...

328
00:34:53,307 --> 00:34:54,433
killed him.

329
00:34:57,411 --> 00:34:59,379
I run it. I run the club now.

330
00:35:01,048 --> 00:35:03,039
Oh, boy! Do I pay.

331
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,745
You know, I loved him.

332
00:35:07,822 --> 00:35:08,880
Why?

333
00:35:10,258 --> 00:35:11,452
Pay?

334
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,217
Got to make a living.

335
00:35:15,163 --> 00:35:16,528
The Organization?

336
00:35:17,298 --> 00:35:18,697
And Mal Reese.

337
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,533
What do you want from me?

338
00:35:31,345 --> 00:35:32,471
Reese.

339
00:35:33,114 --> 00:35:34,479
He owes me money.

340
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:36,714
Lynne and money.

341
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,914
You fix your face.

342
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,788
I've got an extra room,
you can stay here if you want to.

343
00:35:49,864 --> 00:35:50,853
Reese.

344
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,924
I'll get him for you.

345
00:36:10,518 --> 00:36:12,110
- Well?
- Nothing.

346
00:36:13,054 --> 00:36:15,682
I got guys out all night looking for him.

347
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,155
Not a sign of him.

348
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,055
Everything humanly possible, Mal.

349
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:10,533
- See you at noon.
- You...

350
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,470
Don't get lost.

351
00:37:25,325 --> 00:37:26,690
Yes, Mr. Carter.

352
00:37:28,295 --> 00:37:30,195
You can go in now, Mr. Reese.

353
00:37:42,842 --> 00:37:45,777
The usual formalities, Mr. Reese.
Nice and high.

354
00:37:47,447 --> 00:37:48,744
There you go.

355
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,518
Three copies to them
and two up to Santa Barbara.

356
00:37:58,158 --> 00:38:00,092
Three copies to Santa Barbara?

357
00:38:00,226 --> 00:38:01,454
I said two.

358
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,160
What the hell
are you fooling around with now?

359
00:38:10,737 --> 00:38:13,638
There's a lot at stake, Mr. Carter.
That's why I came to you.

360
00:38:13,707 --> 00:38:16,540
- That's why I must...
- Must? There's no must about it.

361
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:19,339
I'd be grateful for anything you could do.

362
00:38:19,412 --> 00:38:22,279
You're trouble. I've always thought so.

363
00:38:24,517 --> 00:38:27,918
I was against taking you back in,
but I was overruled.

364
00:38:28,755 --> 00:38:31,690
Wherever you go, trouble finds you out.

365
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:36,025
I certainly would appreciate
anything you could do for me.

366
00:38:37,664 --> 00:38:39,097
What's his name?

367
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:40,525
Walker.

368
00:38:41,267 --> 00:38:42,734
What's his first name?

369
00:38:42,802 --> 00:38:46,602
He never called himself anything but that.
I've known him for years.

370
00:38:46,773 --> 00:38:48,434
Not even his wife.

371
00:38:48,942 --> 00:38:51,740
Wife have something to do
with his grudge?

372
00:38:52,779 --> 00:38:53,871
Yeah.

373
00:38:55,548 --> 00:38:56,640
Figures.

374
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:04,556
You know, that mess you got us into
last year cost us $150,000.

375
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:08,757
That's what Walker's here for, isn't it?
The money you paid us back.

376
00:39:08,828 --> 00:39:10,796
Only $93,000 belonged to him.

377
00:39:10,864 --> 00:39:12,764
Only $93,000?

378
00:39:13,867 --> 00:39:15,357
What's the story?

379
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:17,837
A job, Mr. Carter.

380
00:39:18,471 --> 00:39:20,564
You remember the Alcatraz run?

381
00:39:21,241 --> 00:39:23,368
The one I brought into the Organization.

382
00:39:23,443 --> 00:39:25,741
Walker was one of the men you held up?

383
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:28,840
No, he was with me.

384
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,411
You took his share, too, is that it?

385
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:35,079
I needed all of it to pay you back.

386
00:39:35,255 --> 00:39:38,588
You left with Walker's share and his wife.

387
00:39:39,292 --> 00:39:41,624
- She still with you?
- He killed her.

388
00:39:42,495 --> 00:39:44,622
You shouldn't have left him alive.

389
00:39:45,131 --> 00:39:46,928
Does he know where you are?

390
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:49,430
No, but he's looking.

391
00:39:51,504 --> 00:39:53,631
Fine. I'll tell you what we'll do.

392
00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:58,402
We'll let him know where you are.

393
00:39:59,646 --> 00:40:01,841
He'll come for you, won't he?

394
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:09,879
They're waiting.

395
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,882
It's a setup.

396
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:15,189
They're spreading the word now.
They want you to try and get him.

397
00:40:15,261 --> 00:40:16,660
Where is he?

398
00:40:16,796 --> 00:40:19,321
The Huntley.
A place run by the Organization.

399
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:26,364
- Where would he be?
- All the way up. The penthouse.

400
00:40:28,107 --> 00:40:30,166
He always uses it.

401
00:40:30,577 --> 00:40:31,874
What's it like?

402
00:40:32,779 --> 00:40:33,973
Fort Knox.

403
00:40:35,915 --> 00:40:37,314
You've been there?

404
00:40:39,085 --> 00:40:41,280
Once. To see Lynne.

405
00:40:54,534 --> 00:40:57,503
- What's that? An apartment house?
- Yeah.

406
00:40:59,506 --> 00:41:00,871
Residential.

407
00:41:09,549 --> 00:41:11,380
That goes up to the top?

408
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:15,615
There's another elevator inside the lobby.
It goes up to the other penthouse.

409
00:41:15,922 --> 00:41:17,116
They got two?

410
00:41:19,726 --> 00:41:22,854
- What's the roof like?
- Flat, open.

411
00:41:26,165 --> 00:41:28,463
Look at it. Men everywhere.

412
00:41:29,435 --> 00:41:32,700
You're going to have a lot of trouble
getting in...

413
00:41:32,906 --> 00:41:34,840
but you'll never get out.

414
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:02,993
- He has to come out sometime.
- Yeah.

415
00:42:05,138 --> 00:42:07,333
How bad does he want you, Chris?

416
00:42:09,175 --> 00:42:10,369
I don't know.

417
00:42:10,743 --> 00:42:13,075
- Who knows?
- Yeah, you know. How bad?

418
00:42:15,915 --> 00:42:17,610
Pretty bad, I guess.

419
00:42:22,388 --> 00:42:25,516
Bad enough to let you through,
into the Huntley?

420
00:42:29,696 --> 00:42:31,186
Why should I?

421
00:42:32,031 --> 00:42:33,521
It's up to you.

422
00:43:09,435 --> 00:43:11,995
- Mr. Reese, please.
- Right over there.

423
00:43:17,043 --> 00:43:18,806
This way to Heaven.

424
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,987
We have a saying in Brazil.

425
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,227
He says to go on up.

426
00:44:13,332 --> 00:44:14,663
It says...

427
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:17,628
Which means, '<i>'</i>God is Brazilian.'<i>'</i>

428
00:44:17,704 --> 00:44:20,070
So you see,
we have no worry in the world.

429
00:44:20,139 --> 00:44:22,972
- Of course, you have to worry some.
- Why?

430
00:44:23,309 --> 00:44:25,106
That's the way of life.

431
00:44:29,482 --> 00:44:30,847
Hello, Mal.

432
00:44:32,552 --> 00:44:34,417
Go on in, honey.

433
00:44:46,566 --> 00:44:47,658
Are these all right?

434
00:44:47,734 --> 00:44:50,464
Yeah, that'll do fine.
Now, tie yourselves up.

435
00:44:58,778 --> 00:45:00,803
No, not individually, together.

436
00:45:09,989 --> 00:45:11,456
Well, Cinderella...

437
00:45:12,658 --> 00:45:15,593
I was beginning to think
you'd never come for you shoe.

438
00:45:15,661 --> 00:45:17,492
Here I am.

439
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:22,124
What made you change your mind?

440
00:45:22,635 --> 00:45:24,432
It's a woman's privilege.

441
00:45:27,406 --> 00:45:29,806
All good things come to those who wait.

442
00:45:33,646 --> 00:45:35,705
Then, I win first prize.

443
00:45:36,849 --> 00:45:38,316
Scotch?

444
00:45:39,218 --> 00:45:40,617
Scotch is fine.

445
00:45:42,889 --> 00:45:45,517
Do you know how long
I've been hung up on you?

446
00:45:49,595 --> 00:45:52,723
The first time I saw you with Lynne.

447
00:46:01,908 --> 00:46:05,571
I've some business to settle here first.
Then we'll go to New York.

448
00:46:06,045 --> 00:46:08,639
- You take empty bags.
- Sure, Mal.

449
00:46:08,815 --> 00:46:11,375
Operator? Give me the police.
This is an emergency.

450
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:13,247
Wait till they answer.

451
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:17,712
Sir, help me, please. I'm being attacked.

452
00:46:18,124 --> 00:46:22,322
Ferguson, yes. 2291, Western.

453
00:46:22,695 --> 00:46:26,654
Across from the Huntley. Second floor.
Please, for God's sakes hurry up!

454
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,492
- Is that all right?
- That was fine, thank you.

455
00:46:38,544 --> 00:46:40,637
Have you seen Lynne lately?

456
00:46:41,581 --> 00:46:43,310
You know about her and me.

457
00:46:45,251 --> 00:46:47,412
You girls ought to kiss and make up.

458
00:46:48,487 --> 00:46:52,355
I haven't seen her.
Not since the two of you...

459
00:46:56,662 --> 00:46:58,391
You ever meet Walker?

460
00:47:00,433 --> 00:47:01,900
A couple of times.

461
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:05,196
Didn't he die or something?

462
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:08,700
About a year ago.

463
00:47:53,753 --> 00:47:56,551
- What's going on?
- It's okay, Mal.

464
00:47:56,722 --> 00:47:58,212
It's across the way.

465
00:48:18,678 --> 00:48:21,306
- What goes?
- It's across the street.

466
00:48:22,848 --> 00:48:24,873
It's all right!

467
00:48:48,107 --> 00:48:50,905
- What do we do?
- Tell him.

468
00:48:55,147 --> 00:48:57,138
Who died? Who was attacked?

469
00:49:01,187 --> 00:49:03,087
- Mike.
- Yeah?

470
00:49:03,622 --> 00:49:06,420
- A couple of clowns got held up.
- Is that all?

471
00:49:19,271 --> 00:49:23,469
Mal, could we close the curtains?

472
00:49:23,676 --> 00:49:24,836
Sure.

473
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:31,876
It's a great view from up here.

474
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:52,890
Get up!

475
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,283
You okay, Mal?

476
00:51:16,889 --> 00:51:18,083
Yeah.

477
00:51:20,726 --> 00:51:23,160
- What're you going to do?
- I want you to come with me.

478
00:51:23,229 --> 00:51:25,459
- What for?
- I want my $93,000.

479
00:51:31,504 --> 00:51:32,937
You don't stand a chance.

480
00:51:35,474 --> 00:51:37,533
Wake up.

481
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:40,636
Wake up. Don't go to sleep. Come on.

482
00:51:40,713 --> 00:51:42,374
On your feet. Let's go.

483
00:51:43,282 --> 00:51:46,274
- Let me get dressed.
- I want you this way.

484
00:51:46,352 --> 00:51:48,877
- My money.
- I've given it all to the Organization.

485
00:51:48,954 --> 00:51:50,717
- Who has it?
- There's no one man.

486
00:51:50,789 --> 00:51:52,620
If you go high, there's always one man.

487
00:51:52,691 --> 00:51:55,159
No, it's not like that. It's a big operation!

488
00:51:56,762 --> 00:51:58,855
Names, Mal.

489
00:51:59,331 --> 00:52:00,730
Fairfax.

490
00:52:02,034 --> 00:52:03,331
Brewster.

491
00:52:05,337 --> 00:52:07,897
Carter. Come on, kill me.

492
00:52:07,973 --> 00:52:09,372
Who do you work for?

493
00:52:09,441 --> 00:52:12,001
Carter. Come on, Walker, kill me.

494
00:52:12,077 --> 00:52:13,510
Where do I find him?

495
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:16,412
It won't do you any good.
He's got protection.

496
00:52:16,682 --> 00:52:18,274
Where do I find him?

497
00:52:18,884 --> 00:52:21,216
- I can't remember.
- What do you mean?

498
00:52:22,321 --> 00:52:23,583
- I remember now.
- Where?

499
00:52:23,656 --> 00:52:25,021
Stuart Building.

500
00:52:25,224 --> 00:52:26,623
He's got offices there.

501
00:52:26,692 --> 00:52:30,458
It's called the Multiplex Company.
On the 12th floor.

502
00:52:30,529 --> 00:52:32,224
What's to keep me from getting him?

503
00:52:32,298 --> 00:52:34,789
No one gets in there
without being searched.

504
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:36,892
Stop worrying about me.
Worry about yourself.

505
00:52:39,038 --> 00:52:41,336
I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll get it for you.

506
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:42,499
But you've got to trust me.

507
00:52:42,575 --> 00:52:44,907
Trust me, Walker. Trust me!

508
00:52:46,745 --> 00:52:47,769
You...

509
00:52:47,846 --> 00:52:50,781
You're my friend, Walker.
You're my last chance.

510
00:52:50,916 --> 00:52:54,010
I'm taking you to Carter.
We're going to do this one together.

511
00:52:54,086 --> 00:52:56,020
Sure we will, Walker! We'll live forever!

512
00:52:58,023 --> 00:52:59,183
Mal?

513
00:53:52,678 --> 00:53:54,111
Drop it!

514
00:53:58,684 --> 00:54:00,083
Don't shoot!

515
00:54:00,519 --> 00:54:01,850
Save me!

516
00:54:03,889 --> 00:54:05,151
Don't shoot us!

517
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:08,756
What's the trouble here?
Who are you trying to kill?

518
00:54:08,827 --> 00:54:11,694
My leg! My knee! Stop!

519
00:54:15,267 --> 00:54:16,757
Take it easy!

520
00:54:22,641 --> 00:54:23,869
My knee!

521
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,961
What's happened?

522
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:52,530
Come on.

523
00:55:37,549 --> 00:55:39,312
I saw it, the ambulance, and everything.

524
00:55:39,385 --> 00:55:40,852
Yeah, he fell.

525
00:55:41,253 --> 00:55:44,450
You let him fall? You should've killed him.
You owe it to yourself.

526
00:55:44,523 --> 00:55:48,050
This money belonged to your sister.
You'd better take it.

527
00:55:49,862 --> 00:55:51,887
You died at Alcatraz, all right.

528
00:55:52,564 --> 00:55:55,431
- Goodbye, Walker.
- Yeah, goodbye, Chris.

529
00:56:02,207 --> 00:56:04,971
Yes, I'd like the number
of the Multiplex Products Company.

530
00:56:05,043 --> 00:56:06,635
That's in Los Angeles.

531
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:11,242
If you're looking for Carter,
I might be able to help you.

532
00:56:20,259 --> 00:56:22,022
Fred? Helen?

533
00:56:23,162 --> 00:56:25,756
- Did I interrupt you? I'm so sorry.
- Fred? Excellent.

534
00:56:25,831 --> 00:56:28,391
Mr. Carter, I want something from you.

535
00:56:28,467 --> 00:56:30,799
- What's that?
- My $93,000.

536
00:56:31,804 --> 00:56:34,398
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's my money.

537
00:56:34,773 --> 00:56:37,003
- Fred, call me in the morning.
- Yes, you bet.

538
00:56:37,075 --> 00:56:39,942
I haven't got time to turn around.
Luncheons, dinners.

539
00:56:40,012 --> 00:56:41,707
I'm getting fat as a pig.

540
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,475
Reese owed us a sum, he paid it back.

541
00:56:43,549 --> 00:56:45,346
Any debt he has to you is his problem.

542
00:56:45,417 --> 00:56:47,044
It's your problem now.

543
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:48,586
Why don't you move over?

544
00:56:48,654 --> 00:56:51,384
- You don't own the place, you know.
- I'm sorry.

545
00:56:51,723 --> 00:56:52,985
Over here.

546
00:56:53,826 --> 00:56:55,691
Don't monopolize him.

547
00:56:56,695 --> 00:56:59,095
- Let me tell you about Reese.
- Reese is dead.

548
00:56:59,164 --> 00:57:02,930
They're scraping his body up
off the sidewalk in front of the Huntley.

549
00:57:03,535 --> 00:57:07,062
- Then his debt died with him, I'm afraid.
- Wrong. It passed on to you.

550
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:10,506
No business corporation in the world
would acknowledge a debt like that.

551
00:57:10,576 --> 00:57:12,407
If you don't, I'll kill you.

552
00:57:14,813 --> 00:57:17,281
...one jump ahead of these
foreign designers.

553
00:57:17,349 --> 00:57:19,977
You must be stark, staring mad.

554
00:57:20,619 --> 00:57:23,247
- You don't know who you're dealing with.
- Listen to me.

555
00:57:23,322 --> 00:57:25,483
I want my money in 12 hours.

556
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:27,818
I'll tell you where to make the drop.

557
00:57:27,893 --> 00:57:30,157
If you don't, you are dead.

558
00:57:32,664 --> 00:57:34,996
I said nobody was to go up there!

559
00:57:35,734 --> 00:57:38,567
He could've done without a girl
for one night.

560
00:57:38,637 --> 00:57:41,037
- Mal told us to let her through.
- Did he?

561
00:57:41,573 --> 00:57:43,370
Is that what I should tell our friends?

562
00:57:43,442 --> 00:57:45,637
You know what this is gonna cost me
to cover up?

563
00:57:45,711 --> 00:57:48,271
That girl was Walker's sister-in-law!

564
00:57:48,514 --> 00:57:49,708
We didn't know that.

565
00:57:49,781 --> 00:57:52,443
Well, he did. How the hell did he know?

566
00:57:52,818 --> 00:57:55,810
- She was the Trojan horse.
- What did you say?

567
00:57:55,988 --> 00:57:58,286
I said she was the Trojan horse.

568
00:57:59,057 --> 00:58:00,684
Trojan horse.

569
00:58:02,127 --> 00:58:03,958
You're a smart boy, Stegman.

570
00:58:05,731 --> 00:58:07,631
Come on, I wanna talk to you.

571
00:58:09,401 --> 00:58:12,063
- Get rid of them and bring the stuff.
- Right.

572
00:58:12,137 --> 00:58:13,661
The door is this way.

573
00:58:13,872 --> 00:58:15,965
Do you know
what I'm gonna do about Walker?

574
00:58:16,041 --> 00:58:17,702
You're going to have him...

575
00:58:18,043 --> 00:58:19,476
- Wrong.
- Wrong?

576
00:58:19,678 --> 00:58:22,579
Killing Walker is no longer
an economic proposition.

577
00:58:23,048 --> 00:58:24,982
What about the principle?

578
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,575
Profit is the only principle. Come in.

579
00:58:29,721 --> 00:58:31,416
What are you gonna to do?

580
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:33,720
Nothing. You're gonna do it.

581
00:58:34,426 --> 00:58:36,189
You're gonna pay Walker off.

582
00:58:36,261 --> 00:58:37,523
Is this money?

583
00:58:37,796 --> 00:58:39,730
Ever been so close to so much?

584
00:58:40,499 --> 00:58:43,332
I made an agreement with Walker
last night.

585
00:58:44,937 --> 00:58:46,734
The storm drain here.

586
00:58:47,372 --> 00:58:49,169
An open storm drain.

587
00:58:49,908 --> 00:58:52,741
You go down and wait. Walker will collect.

588
00:58:53,078 --> 00:58:55,342
- But why?
- Why what?

589
00:58:55,847 --> 00:58:59,044
- Why me?
- 'Cause you know what he looks like.

590
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:01,445
Sure.

591
00:59:02,321 --> 00:59:04,482
When do you want me to go?

592
00:59:04,756 --> 00:59:06,383
Now, Stegman.

593
00:59:07,593 --> 00:59:09,823
- Use that door.
- Sure.

594
00:59:11,663 --> 00:59:13,290
- Stegman.
- Yes?

595
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,533
You will give Walker his money,
won't you?

596
00:59:17,703 --> 00:59:18,692
Yes.

597
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:22,306
Good. You wouldn't try what Reese did,
would you?

598
01:00:16,428 --> 01:00:17,725
Can I help you?

599
01:00:31,309 --> 01:00:34,506
- Which door is he?
- Behind me.

600
01:00:35,681 --> 01:00:37,239
Okay, the buzzer.

601
01:00:56,535 --> 01:00:57,661
What are you doing in here?

602
01:00:57,736 --> 01:00:59,897
- What do you want?
- I want my money.

603
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:04,509
I don't understand.
It's all arranged as you wanted.

604
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,210
You're crazy, Walker.
How can this help you?

605
01:01:11,283 --> 01:01:12,477
Let's go.

606
01:01:18,557 --> 01:01:20,957
Because I want you to pay me personally.

607
01:01:22,027 --> 01:01:23,892
You can't take me out of here in daylight.

608
01:02:07,472 --> 01:02:09,736
Things aren't done this way.
Let's be reasonable.

609
01:02:09,808 --> 01:02:10,797
It's a setup.

610
01:02:10,876 --> 01:02:12,935
- I assure you, I always...
- Don't.

611
01:02:37,869 --> 01:02:40,133
- Can you authorize the payoff?
- Yeah.

612
01:02:40,205 --> 01:02:41,536
- Then you're the top man.
- Right.

613
01:02:41,606 --> 01:02:43,403
- What about Brewster?
- How do you know...

614
01:02:43,475 --> 01:02:44,703
Reese talked!

615
01:02:45,377 --> 01:02:47,072
Two of us run things, Brewster and I.

616
01:02:47,145 --> 01:02:48,169
- Nobody else?
- Right.

617
01:02:48,246 --> 01:02:49,270
Nobody?

618
01:02:49,347 --> 01:02:51,042
- There's a money man.
- What's his name?

619
01:02:51,116 --> 01:02:52,583
- Makes no difference.
- His name!

620
01:02:52,651 --> 01:02:54,084
Fairfax!

621
01:02:56,154 --> 01:02:59,817
I'm a businessman. A man of my word.
Stegman's got your money, go get it.

622
01:02:59,891 --> 01:03:01,415
You go get it for me.

623
01:03:04,095 --> 01:03:06,154
No, it's all right!

624
01:03:07,165 --> 01:03:09,190
It's all right, it's Carter!

625
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:32,101
- With that little thing?
- It's high-velocity. He was a good shot.

626
01:05:33,778 --> 01:05:35,575
Carter, Brewster, Fairfax.

627
01:05:36,381 --> 01:05:39,179
- Brewster's next.
- Where do I find him?

628
01:05:39,851 --> 01:05:42,911
- He's out of town.
- When will he be back?

629
01:05:43,822 --> 01:05:47,952
- Tomorrow morning, he's got a meeting.
- I want him alone.

630
01:05:49,728 --> 01:05:51,662
We can fix that.

631
01:05:51,963 --> 01:05:55,091
- Where's the meeting?
- At his house.

632
01:05:55,667 --> 01:05:57,498
Where's his house?

633
01:05:59,704 --> 01:06:02,332
We're here. This is it.

634
01:06:04,042 --> 01:06:05,339
I said alone.

635
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:11,474
Take it easy. You'll last longer.

636
01:06:59,898 --> 01:07:01,559
Hello, Walker.

637
01:07:03,735 --> 01:07:05,726
They really got to you, huh?

638
01:07:06,404 --> 01:07:09,100
I got well paid for fingering Reese.

639
01:07:16,681 --> 01:07:19,844
The place is like a morgue.
I should've moved months ago.

640
01:07:20,085 --> 01:07:23,248
This guy you were going around with,
did he...

641
01:07:25,323 --> 01:07:26,915
spend some time here?

642
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:29,026
Yes.

643
01:07:30,662 --> 01:07:32,823
A lot of this stuff was his.

644
01:07:34,065 --> 01:07:35,896
What're you going to do now?

645
01:07:36,935 --> 01:07:39,768
I don't know. What about you?

646
01:07:46,177 --> 01:07:47,769
Are you asking me out?

647
01:08:23,815 --> 01:08:25,112
Walker?

648
01:08:41,766 --> 01:08:43,199
Come on in.

649
01:08:50,341 --> 01:08:51,774
Whose is it?

650
01:08:53,244 --> 01:08:56,611
Brewster's. It belongs to the Organization.
They use it for meetings.

651
01:08:56,681 --> 01:08:58,876
Nobody lives in it, that's for sure.

652
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:02,213
Brewster? How do you know
he won't show up?

653
01:09:02,287 --> 01:09:04,812
He will, that's why we're here.
I'm waiting for him.

654
01:09:04,889 --> 01:09:06,254
What am I doing here?

655
01:09:06,324 --> 01:09:09,418
I thought you'd be safer with me
than you would be by yourself.

656
01:09:09,494 --> 01:09:12,122
And when do we expect our host?

657
01:09:12,463 --> 01:09:15,159
Anytime. Maybe not until morning.

658
01:09:15,233 --> 01:09:18,259
You'll ask him for the money,
he'll say no, and you'll kill him.

659
01:09:18,336 --> 01:09:21,897
Something like that.
What did you think this was, a pitch?

660
01:09:23,708 --> 01:09:26,609
- Forget it.
- You forget it.

661
01:10:22,133 --> 01:10:23,657
<i>Good morning, Stevey.</i>

662
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:32,699
<i>It wasn't Lois'idea, or Mrs.</i> J<i>enkins'.</i>
<i>It was yours.</i>

663
01:10:34,078 --> 01:10:36,342
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>
<i>Get real flattered...</i>

664
01:10:36,414 --> 01:10:39,076
<i>and be grateful to you</i>
<i>for the rest of my life?</i>

665
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:42,950
<i>You figure this will get me over</i>
<i>my neurotic inertia or something?</i>

666
01:10:43,021 --> 01:10:45,546
<i>- Get out of here.</i>
<i>- You know what?</i>

667
01:10:53,298 --> 01:10:56,199
<i>The most fabulous things happen</i>
<i>to a girl...</i>

668
01:10:56,668 --> 01:10:59,694
<i>when she tries Pond's</i>
<i>seven-day beauty plan.</i>

669
01:10:59,804 --> 01:11:01,237
<i>All I did...</i>

670
01:11:01,372 --> 01:11:05,035
<i>was cream twice each night for a week</i>
<i>with Pond's cold cream.</i>

671
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:42,833
<i>You're a pathetic sight, Walker,</i>
<i>from where I'm standing.</i>

672
01:12:42,907 --> 01:12:44,568
<i>Chasing shadows.</i>

673
01:12:45,276 --> 01:12:48,143
<i>You're played out. It's over.</i>

674
01:12:49,113 --> 01:12:50,637
<i>It's finished.</i>

675
01:12:50,848 --> 01:12:53,646
<i>What would you do with the money</i>
<i>if you got it?</i>

676
01:12:53,718 --> 01:12:55,743
<i>Wasn't yours in the first place.</i>

677
01:12:56,154 --> 01:12:59,214
<i>Why don't you just lie down and die?</i>

678
01:16:25,296 --> 01:16:27,856
- Going to work?
- Another day, another dollar.

679
01:16:33,471 --> 01:16:35,439
- Welcome back, boss.
- Bill.

680
01:16:38,409 --> 01:16:40,206
- What do you want?
- My money.

681
01:16:40,277 --> 01:16:41,608
What for?

682
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:44,580
- For Stegman.
- Stegman's nothing. Who killed Carter?

683
01:16:46,851 --> 01:16:49,081
Bill, the briefcase.

684
01:16:51,489 --> 01:16:52,888
I did.

685
01:16:54,258 --> 01:16:56,818
You did, huh? What happened?

686
01:16:59,397 --> 01:17:02,560
Carter set it up.
He was where Walker should've been.

687
01:17:03,534 --> 01:17:06,367
- You don't care, do you?
- No, I love it.

688
01:17:06,437 --> 01:17:07,768
That leaves you in a spot.

689
01:17:07,838 --> 01:17:09,829
You killed the man
who was going to pay you.

690
01:17:09,907 --> 01:17:12,501
- Who pays me?
- I can't hear you.

691
01:17:20,317 --> 01:17:22,512
- What about Walker?
- What?

692
01:17:22,853 --> 01:17:24,445
Walker's still around.

693
01:17:25,489 --> 01:17:27,616
The Organization will take care of Walker.

694
01:17:27,692 --> 01:17:29,785
It'll never happen. He's a pro.

695
01:17:30,061 --> 01:17:32,928
Walker's beautiful.
He's just tearing you apart.

696
01:17:35,933 --> 01:17:38,493
- You coming with me?
- Pass.

697
01:17:41,105 --> 01:17:43,869
I'll wait for Fairfax. He'll pay me.

698
01:17:45,309 --> 01:17:49,643
All right. And if he doesn't,
you can kill him, too.

699
01:18:38,395 --> 01:18:39,384
Hey.

700
01:18:44,001 --> 01:18:45,491
What's my last name?

701
01:18:51,509 --> 01:18:53,033
What's my first name?

702
01:19:18,936 --> 01:19:20,801
Look at that hillside.

703
01:19:21,705 --> 01:19:24,196
Nobody did any watering or anything.

704
01:19:27,111 --> 01:19:30,774
You tell people to do things around here,
and it doesn't make any difference.

705
01:19:30,848 --> 01:19:32,110
Just a minute.

706
01:19:37,288 --> 01:19:39,085
It's ice-cold, Bill.

707
01:20:06,116 --> 01:20:07,743
Walker?

708
01:20:09,153 --> 01:20:11,678
You're a very bad man.
A very destructive man!

709
01:20:11,755 --> 01:20:14,656
Why do you run around doing things
like this? What do you want?

710
01:20:14,725 --> 01:20:16,022
I want my money.

711
01:20:16,093 --> 01:20:17,583
I want my $93,000.

712
01:20:17,761 --> 01:20:19,388
$93,000?

713
01:20:20,297 --> 01:20:23,095
You threaten a financial structure like this
for $93,000?

714
01:20:23,167 --> 01:20:26,034
I don't believe you.
What do you really want?

715
01:20:26,103 --> 01:20:27,570
I really want my money.

716
01:20:27,638 --> 01:20:29,435
I want my money.

717
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:34,072
I'm not gonna give you any money,
and nobody else is, don't you understand?

718
01:20:38,849 --> 01:20:40,214
Who runs things?

719
01:20:40,317 --> 01:20:42,615
Carter and I run things. I run things.

720
01:20:43,587 --> 01:20:45,418
What about Fairfax? Will he pay me?

721
01:20:45,489 --> 01:20:48,083
Fairfax is a man who signs checks.

722
01:20:48,792 --> 01:20:49,952
No, cash.

723
01:20:50,027 --> 01:20:52,825
Fairfax isn't going to give you anything.
He's finished.

724
01:20:52,897 --> 01:20:54,922
Fairfax is dead,
he just doesn't know it yet.

725
01:20:54,999 --> 01:20:56,933
Somebody's got to pay.

726
01:21:03,908 --> 01:21:07,207
- Make a phone call.
- It's a waste of time!

727
01:21:13,717 --> 01:21:14,877
All right.

728
01:21:17,021 --> 01:21:20,218
I'm just getting a cigar out of here,
that's all.

729
01:21:30,534 --> 01:21:31,728
Cash.

730
01:21:32,736 --> 01:21:35,762
You think I can go
to some hole in the wall...

731
01:21:35,839 --> 01:21:39,741
take out $93,000, and peel it off for you?

732
01:21:41,812 --> 01:21:44,280
<i>- Operator.</i>
- Yeah, Brewster, Los Angeles.

733
01:21:44,348 --> 01:21:45,713
Get me Mr. Fairfax, will you?

734
01:21:45,783 --> 01:21:48,183
Let me tell you something
about corporations.

735
01:21:48,252 --> 01:21:50,550
This is a corporation,
and I'm an officer in it.

736
01:21:50,621 --> 01:21:54,955
We deal in millions, we never see cash.
I got about $11 in my pocket.

737
01:21:55,492 --> 01:21:58,086
<i>- How are you?</i>
- Yeah, I just got in.

738
01:21:58,162 --> 01:21:59,686
<i>How's the weather up there?</i>

739
01:21:59,763 --> 01:22:03,426
It's all right.
Dried up the lawn a little bit. Listen...

740
01:22:03,867 --> 01:22:07,860
I got a man named Walker with me.
He says we owe him $93,000.

741
01:22:12,042 --> 01:22:13,839
Are you going to say anything?

742
01:22:13,911 --> 01:22:15,970
<i>What do you want me to say?</i>

743
01:22:20,317 --> 01:22:24,014
He says he's going to shoot me
unless I give him $93,000.

744
01:22:24,455 --> 01:22:26,980
<i>Brewster, you know me better than that.</i>

745
01:22:30,494 --> 01:22:32,223
Want to say a word?

746
01:22:32,997 --> 01:22:35,488
How much is Brewster
worth to you, Fairfax?

747
01:22:35,933 --> 01:22:38,731
<i>Threatening phone calls don't impress me.</i>

748
01:22:41,071 --> 01:22:44,404
Fairfax, I think he's getting ready
to fire the gun.

749
01:22:44,641 --> 01:22:46,905
- Yes or no?
<i>- Of course not.</i>

750
01:23:03,227 --> 01:23:06,663
- What's happened?
- Nothing. Where'd you come from?

751
01:23:07,064 --> 01:23:09,157
- I'm with him.
- You're...

752
01:23:18,842 --> 01:23:22,437
Walker, it occurred to me that...

753
01:23:25,349 --> 01:23:28,341
we might still be able
to do something for you.

754
01:23:28,619 --> 01:23:30,780
I mean, get you the money you want.

755
01:23:32,156 --> 01:23:34,249
But not here in Los Angeles.

756
01:23:35,159 --> 01:23:38,390
There's still one setup where
large sums of money change hands.

757
01:23:38,462 --> 01:23:40,191
It's up in San Francisco.

758
01:23:41,265 --> 01:23:42,459
The Alcatraz run.

759
01:23:42,533 --> 01:23:44,524
You remember it, with Reese.

760
01:23:45,369 --> 01:23:48,167
It' s still there. Once a week. Every week.

761
01:23:48,305 --> 01:23:49,670
Alcatraz.

762
01:23:51,508 --> 01:23:54,841
The drop's changed,
but the run is still the same.

763
01:23:55,946 --> 01:23:58,312
If you wanna go up to San Francisco...

764
01:24:01,085 --> 01:24:02,814
Her, too, if you want her.

765
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:05,449
Anything you want.

766
01:24:07,057 --> 01:24:08,752
You can trust me, Walker.

767
01:24:25,843 --> 01:24:28,971
There's supposed to be a light
on that landing where you are!

768
01:24:29,046 --> 01:24:31,947
I don't know exactly where it is,
but it's up there.

769
01:24:37,788 --> 01:24:39,221
Is that it?

770
01:24:48,699 --> 01:24:50,291
All right, good.

771
01:24:50,567 --> 01:24:52,592
Just stay in the light.

772
01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:57,037
- What do you mean?
- Nothing is going to happen, is it?

773
01:24:57,107 --> 01:25:00,804
No, nothing's gonna happen,
except what I said was gonna happen.

774
01:25:00,878 --> 01:25:04,644
We're gonna make the exchange
and you're gonna get your money.

775
01:25:07,818 --> 01:25:10,218
The whole thing's just a routine.

776
01:25:19,062 --> 01:25:20,825
What are you looking for?

777
01:25:21,665 --> 01:25:23,394
There's nobody else here.

778
01:25:27,671 --> 01:25:29,161
Walker?

779
01:25:58,602 --> 01:26:00,035
There it is.

780
01:26:11,715 --> 01:26:13,580
It's coming in.

781
01:26:14,084 --> 01:26:16,575
Safe as a church. Your money.

782
01:26:18,789 --> 01:26:21,121
What about your friend, Fairfax?

783
01:26:22,226 --> 01:26:25,525
Fairfax is dead. Or he will be tomorrow.

784
01:26:25,629 --> 01:26:26,653
It is tomorrow.

785
01:26:26,730 --> 01:26:29,096
- Will you help me carry the box up?
- No.

786
01:27:25,555 --> 01:27:26,920
Here's your money.

787
01:27:36,733 --> 01:27:39,827
Why did you do that?

788
01:27:44,741 --> 01:27:46,436
Walker didn't shoot you.

789
01:27:51,315 --> 01:27:52,373
Fairfax?

790
01:27:56,987 --> 01:27:59,012
This is Fairfax, Walker!

791
01:28:00,223 --> 01:28:01,247
Kill him!

792
01:28:02,793 --> 01:28:04,954
You should've stayed an accountant.

793
01:28:10,567 --> 01:28:12,592
Our deal is done, Walker!

794
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:15,961
Brewster was the last one!

795
01:28:18,442 --> 01:28:21,104
He thought he could take over from me.

796
01:28:34,491 --> 01:28:36,322
Come on in with me.

797
01:28:37,661 --> 01:28:40,630
I've been looking years
for someone like you.

798
01:28:46,903 --> 01:28:49,394
Come and get your money then!

799
01:28:52,476 --> 01:28:54,341
Come on and get it!

800
01:28:59,082 --> 01:29:01,209
I pay my debts!

801
01:29:35,118 --> 01:29:36,244
Well?

802
01:29:47,898 --> 01:29:49,957
This is the last time!

803
01:30:00,877 --> 01:30:02,777
How do you like that?

804
01:30:04,648 --> 01:30:06,115
I like it.

805
01:30:12,956 --> 01:30:14,480
Leave it.

806
01:31:46,349 --> 01:31:47,338
English
