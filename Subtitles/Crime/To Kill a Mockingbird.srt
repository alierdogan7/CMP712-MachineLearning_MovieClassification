Yes, sir. I had to pass her place

She said for me to come there
and help her a minute.

Then she said to come in the house,

So I follows her inside,

"They all gone to get ice cream."

until the doctor gets here.

1354
01:53:07,225 --> 01:53:09,705
Heck ? Atticus Finch.

1355
01:53:09,785 --> 01:53:12,025
Someone's been after my children.

1356
01:53:14,905 --> 01:53:17,225
He's got a bad break.

1357
01:53:17,305 --> 01:53:20,425
Like somebody tried
to wring his arm off.

1358
01:53:26,185 --> 01:53:28,825
I'll be right back, Atticus.

1359
01:53:30,105 --> 01:53:31,945
[ Sheriff ]
How's the boy, Doc ?

1360
01:53:32,025 --> 01:53:33,865
He'll be all right.

1361
01:53:36,025 --> 01:53:37,865
Sheriff Tate.

1362
01:53:46,585 --> 01:53:48,465
[ Clears Throat ]

1363
01:53:55,705 --> 01:53:57,545
What is it, Heck ?

1364
01:54:02,265 --> 01:54:05,225
Bob Ewell's lyin' on the ground
under that tree down yonder...

1365
01:54:05,305 --> 01:54:08,625
with a kitchen knife
stuck up under his ribs.

1366
01:54:10,705 --> 01:54:12,545
He's dead, Mr. Finch.

1367
01:54:26,585 --> 01:54:29,705
- Are you sure ?
- [ Sheriff ] Yes, sir.

1368
01:54:31,585 --> 01:54:35,945
He's not gonna bother
these children anymore.

1369
01:54:37,465 --> 01:54:40,065
Miss Scout, you think you could
tell us what happened ?

1370
01:54:41,785 --> 01:54:43,785
I don't know.

1371
01:54:43,865 --> 01:54:46,025
All of a sudden
somebody grabbed me,

1372
01:54:46,105 --> 01:54:47,985
knocked me down
on the ground.

1373
01:54:48,025 --> 01:54:50,665
Jem found me then.

1374
01:54:50,745 --> 01:54:54,865
Then Mr. Ewell, I reckon,
grabbed him again, and Jem hollered.

1375
01:54:54,905 --> 01:54:59,145
Then somebody grabbed me.
Mr. Ewell, I guess.

1376
01:54:59,225 --> 01:55:02,225
Somebody grabbed him...

1377
01:55:02,305 --> 01:55:05,625
and then I heard someone
pantin' and coughin'.

1378
01:55:09,705 --> 01:55:11,785
Then I saw someone
carrying Jem.

1379
01:55:11,865 --> 01:55:13,945
Well, who was it ?

1380
01:55:17,865 --> 01:55:19,945
Why, there he is, Mr. Tate.

1381
01:55:20,025 --> 01:55:23,585
He can tell you his name.

1382
01:55:48,745 --> 01:55:50,545
Hey, Boo.

1383
01:55:52,505 --> 01:55:56,945
[ Atticus ] Miss Jean Louise,
Mr. Arthur Radley.

1384
01:55:58,745 --> 01:56:01,545
I believe he already knows you.

1385
01:56:10,585 --> 01:56:12,945
Heck, let's go out
on the front porch.

1386
01:56:24,665 --> 01:56:28,625
Would you like to say good night
to Jem, Mr. Arthur ?

1387
01:56:50,065 --> 01:56:53,665
You can pet him, Mr. Arthur.
He's asleep.

1388
01:56:53,745 --> 01:56:57,065
You couldn't if he was awake, though.
He wouldn't let you.

1389
01:57:00,785 --> 01:57:02,945
Go ahead.

1390
01:57:39,025 --> 01:57:41,985
[ Scout ]
Let's go set in the swing, Mr. Arthur.

1391
01:57:45,825 --> 01:57:48,665
[ Atticus ]
Heck, l-l--

1392
01:57:48,705 --> 01:57:53,745
I guess that
the thing to do is, uh--

1393
01:57:56,545 --> 01:58:01,105
Good Lord...
I must be losin' my memory.

1394
01:58:02,465 --> 01:58:07,825
I can't remember
whether Jem is 12 or 13.

1395
01:58:10,785 --> 01:58:16,305
Anyway, it'll have to come
before the county court.

1396
01:58:19,105 --> 01:58:22,905
Of course, it's a clear-cut case
of self-defense.

1397
01:58:22,945 --> 01:58:26,385
I'll, uh-- Well, I'll run down
to the office--

1398
01:58:26,465 --> 01:58:28,945
Mr. Finch...

1399
01:58:29,025 --> 01:58:31,505
do you think Jem
killed Bob Ewell ?

1400
01:58:31,585 --> 01:58:34,705
Is that what you think ?

1401
01:58:34,785 --> 01:58:37,905
Your boy never stabbed him.

1402
01:58:54,105 --> 01:58:57,545
Bob Ewell fell on his knife.

1403
01:58:57,625 --> 01:59:00,905
He killed himself.

1404
01:59:04,185 --> 01:59:06,985
There's a black man
dead for no reason.

1405
01:59:07,065 --> 01:59:10,825
Now the man
responsible for it is dead.

1406
01:59:10,905 --> 01:59:13,865
Let the dead bury the dead
this time, Mr. Finch.

1407
01:59:13,945 --> 01:59:16,265
I never heard tell it was
against the law for any citizen...

1408
01:59:16,345 --> 01:59:18,825
to do his utmost to prevent a crime
from being committed,

1409
01:59:18,905 --> 01:59:20,905
which is exactly what he did.

1410
01:59:20,985 --> 01:59:26,345
But maybe you'll tell me
it's my duty to tell the town
all about it, not to hush it up.

1411
01:59:26,425 --> 01:59:28,745
You know what'll happen then.

1412
01:59:28,825 --> 01:59:30,985
All the ladies in Maycomb,
includin' my wife,

1413
01:59:31,065 --> 01:59:35,305
will be knockin' on his door
bringin' angel food cakes.

1414
01:59:35,385 --> 01:59:38,505
To my way of thinkin',
takin' one man,

1415
01:59:38,585 --> 01:59:41,265
who done you and this town
a big service,

1416
01:59:41,345 --> 01:59:45,305
and draggin' him with his shy ways
into the limelight--

1417
01:59:45,385 --> 01:59:48,505
To me, that's a sin.

1418
01:59:48,585 --> 01:59:50,585
It's a sin.

1419
01:59:50,665 --> 01:59:54,425
And I'm not about
to have it on my head.

1420
01:59:54,505 --> 01:59:57,305
I may not be much,
Mr. Finch,

1421
01:59:57,385 --> 02:00:00,825
but I'm still Sheriff
of Maycomb County,

1422
02:00:00,905 --> 02:00:04,825
and Bob Ewell fell on his knife.

1423
02:00:04,905 --> 02:00:06,745
Good night, sir.

1424
02:00:11,945 --> 02:00:16,185
[ Car Door Shuts, Engine Starts ]

1425
02:00:44,345 --> 02:00:46,865
Mr. Tate was right.

1426
02:00:50,745 --> 02:00:53,265
What do you mean ?

1427
02:00:53,305 --> 02:00:56,945
Well...
it would be...

1428
02:00:56,985 --> 02:01:01,105
sort of like shooting
a mockingbird, wouldn't it ?

1429
02:01:28,025 --> 02:01:30,065
Thank you, Arthur.

1430
02:01:37,585 --> 02:01:40,385
Thank you for my children.

1431
02:01:54,065 --> 02:01:57,185
[ Adult Scout ]
Neighbors bring food with death...

1432
02:01:57,265 --> 02:01:59,265
and flowers with sickness...

1433
02:01:59,345 --> 02:02:02,785
and little things in between.

1434
02:02:02,865 --> 02:02:05,505
Boo was our neighbor.

1435
02:02:05,585 --> 02:02:08,225
He gave us two soap dolls,

1436
02:02:08,305 --> 02:02:10,945
a broken watch and chain,

1437
02:02:11,025 --> 02:02:13,185
a knife...

1438
02:02:13,265 --> 02:02:15,585
and our lives.

1439
02:02:20,305 --> 02:02:23,105
One time Atticus said...

1440
02:02:23,185 --> 02:02:28,385
you never really knew a man
until you stood in his shoes
and walked around in them.

1441
02:02:32,785 --> 02:02:36,785
Just standing
on the Radley porch was enough.

1442
02:02:43,105 --> 02:02:46,705
The summer that had begun
so long ago had ended,

1443
02:02:46,785 --> 02:02:49,105
and another summer
had taken its place.

1444
02:02:49,185 --> 02:02:51,065
And a fall.

1445
02:02:51,105 --> 02:02:54,425
And Boo Radley had come out.

1446
02:02:57,505 --> 02:03:00,825
I was to think
of these days many times,

1447
02:03:00,865 --> 02:03:02,865
of Jem and Dill...

1448
02:03:02,945 --> 02:03:06,065
and Boo Radley
and Tom Robinson.

1449
02:03:07,745 --> 02:03:09,905
And Atticus.

1450
02:03:17,345 --> 02:03:21,265
He would be
in Jem's room all night,

1451
02:03:21,345 --> 02:03:26,065
and he would be there when Jem
waked up in the morning.
