(2nd man ) Come on.

For the six.

00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:19,000
This is Lieutenant Bishop in unmarked
vehicle requesting assignment.

I'm surprised
to hear your voice, sir.

'W-20, so how's it going so far,
Lieutenant?

31

One-W-90, OK,

'Affirmative.'

But they're closing it down.

This way.

48
00:08:58,928 --> 00:09:01,124
They sure gave you some sweet job.

49
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:02,767
Better than some.

50
00:09:02,849 --> 00:09:07,445
Carrying a busload of hate is not
my idea of better than anything.

(Coughs )

52
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:17,119
This is Wells and Cornell.

53
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:21,043
- Is he all right?
- He's just got a little cold.

54
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:25,285
- Where's Wilson?
- We got him in a special room.

55
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,766
This is Napoleon Wilson.

56
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,326
Got a smoke?

57
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,366
Close the door.

58
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,958
I want you to know something, Wilson.

59
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,808
I don't enjoy
driving anybody to Death Row,

60
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,361
but try anything - anything -

61
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:57,364
I've got two guards with shotguns
that'll blow you apart.

62
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,247
Sure could use a smoke.

63
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:02,242
You understand me, Wilson?

64
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:05,487
You mumble a little bit...

65
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,562
I get the general idea.

66
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:10,807
Let's go.

67
00:10:22,932 --> 00:10:25,207
Slipped right out of the chair.

68
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:33,604
Yeah, I don't sit in chairs
as well as I used to.

69
00:10:35,012 --> 00:10:36,525
Get him up.

70
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:38,364
All right, let's go.

71
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:05,372
I'm all jealous of you, Wilson.
You get this VIP treatment.

72
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:07,808
They let me walk around almost free.

73
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:09,531
- Hey.
- What?

74
00:11:09,613 --> 00:11:13,368
- You got a smoke?
- Yeah, but I'm not giving it to you.

75
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:17,288
- Why not?
- Smoking can kill you.

76
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:19,649
You don't like competition, huh?

77
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:23,124
You think you're real fancy,
don't you?

78
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:25,170
I have moments.

79
00:11:25,254 --> 00:11:27,814
Knock off the talking. Let's move.

80
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:29,646
(Coughing)

81
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:39,169
OK if I...stretch a minute?

82
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:43,645
You're gonna chain me to a seat
and drive for hours,

83
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:47,364
then you're gonna chain me in a cell,
maybe for 90 years.

84
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:50,529
Chains is all I got
to look forward to.

85
00:11:50,615 --> 00:11:52,048
Go ahead.

86
00:11:57,895 --> 00:12:01,205
You know, Wilson, I'm gonna miss you.

87
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:05,932
That's not the truth, Warden.

88
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,890
Now, you should always
tell the truth.

89
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:15,651
Even a little white lie
can sometimes trip a man up.

90
00:12:17,816 --> 00:12:18,885
Oh!

91
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:28,325
He don't stand up
as good as he used to.

92
00:12:44,657 --> 00:12:47,455

caused an...'

(Turns radio off)

98
00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:16,897
Let's go over this again,
what are you gonna tell Margaret?

99
00:13:16,978 --> 00:13:18,536
I forget.

100
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:23,009
You say, "Margaret, I want you
to live with us now Fred is gone."

101
00:13:23,098 --> 00:13:26,409
I want you to come
and live with us now Fred is dead.

102
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:28,330
- Gone.
- Gone.

103
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:31,729
"We have a big spare room
all ready for you."

104
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:34,414
We have a big spare room
all ready for you.

105
00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:39,129
"And I told my daddy
if you don't come and live with us

106
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,779
"I'm going to run away from home."

107
00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:44,373
She'll never buy that.

108
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:47,808
- OK, drop that one.
- Daddy?

109
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:50,129
- Yeah?
- I'm hungry.

110
00:13:50,219 --> 00:13:55,214
You'd rather eat than get your nanny
out of this...horrible neighbourhood?

111
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,418
I'd know what to say even better
if I had something to eat.

112
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,857
Where is that street?
I can never seem to find that street.

113
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,896
(Girl) Why don't we ask them?

114
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,054
Uh...Bonair Place, I think
it's just a couple of blocks more.

115
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,133
Mr Seward
says policemen answer questions

116
00:14:19,221 --> 00:14:21,291
and help when you're in trouble.

117
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:26,933
Obviously, Mr Seward has never taken
any steps outside of the sixth grade.

118
00:14:27,021 --> 00:14:28,420
Huh?

119
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:32,016
We're not in any trouble, honey.

120
00:15:22,743 --> 00:15:24,699
(Revs engine )

121
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,137
Yeah?

122
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:39,219
Uh, I'm Lieutenant Bishop.

123
00:17:40,388 --> 00:17:44,666
Yes, sir. One moment,
I'll tell the captain you're here.

124
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:54,382
(Knocks )

125
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:05,787
Hello, Lieutenant.

126
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:07,018
Hi.

127
00:18:07,109 --> 00:18:09,543
- I'm Leigh.
- Ethan Bishop.

128
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:11,585
(Leigh) This is Julie.

129
00:18:12,469 --> 00:18:14,425
- Hello, Julie.
- Hello.

130
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,705
- Things are quiet.
- For a change.

131
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,826
You took over at the right time.

132
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,141
Apparently.
When are you moving?

133
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,064
They shut off the phones and
electricity at 10am tomorrow.

134
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,788
Sounds pretty final.

135
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,623
- Would you like some coffee?
- Thank you.

136
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,746
- I'll get you one.
- Thanks.

137
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,025
(Julie ) Hello, 7814?

138
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,708
No, the precinct has been relocated.
Let me give you the new number.

139
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:48,750
Seven-three-four-three-six-one-two.

140
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,309
You're welcome.

141
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:55,543
Phone company should be doing this.
They were due at five.

142
00:18:58,151 --> 00:19:01,700
(Julie ) Hello, may I speak
to supervisor 12, please?

143
00:19:14,192 --> 00:19:15,545
Black?

144
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:17,782
For over 30 years.

145
00:19:19,552 --> 00:19:21,508
I'm sorry.

146
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,868
Two sugars.

147
00:19:28,592 --> 00:19:31,868
I grew up...four blocks from here.

148
00:19:34,512 --> 00:19:37,869
When I was four my father
sent me in here with a note.

149
00:19:37,953 --> 00:19:42,868
Detective read it and said, "We lock
up little boys who can't behave."

150
00:19:42,953 --> 00:19:47,902
When he called my father I carved
something on his desk with a knife.

151
00:19:47,993 --> 00:19:51,224
For months I was afraid
he might come after me.

152
00:19:51,993 --> 00:19:54,666
Why did your father send you in here?

153
00:19:54,753 --> 00:19:58,348
For using foul language
in the presence of my mother.

154
00:20:00,393 --> 00:20:02,429
What did you carve on the desk?

155
00:20:07,594 --> 00:20:09,550
Advanced for a little kid.

156
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:16,712
Your father obviously got you
out of Anderson early enough.

157
00:20:21,114 --> 00:20:23,469
The captain would like to see you.

158
00:20:24,394 --> 00:20:25,952
Be right there.

159
00:20:27,874 --> 00:20:29,830
By the way,

160
00:20:29,915 --> 00:20:33,908
no one took me
out of Anderson when I was a baby.

161
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:36,668
I walked out myself when I was 20.

162
00:20:37,715 --> 00:20:40,991
- Enjoy your new police station.
- I will.

163
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,031
Thanks for the coffee.

164
00:20:48,475 --> 00:20:50,033
(Man ) Then get 'em out!

165
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,709
Double your patrols.
Send 'em up there.

166
00:20:52,795 --> 00:20:56,630
Don't call here
every time a division stubs its toe!

167
00:20:59,556 --> 00:21:01,228
What a night!

168
00:21:01,316 --> 00:21:03,546
We've had a 3-12 every 15 minutes.

169
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:07,834
12 stolen cars, three burglaries,
eight aggravated assaults,

170
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,476
and it's not even eight o'clock.

171
00:21:19,876 --> 00:21:22,026
Could be the sun spots.

172
00:21:23,597 --> 00:21:26,031
Pressure on the atmosphere.

173
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,307
I heard it on the radio.

174
00:21:31,837 --> 00:21:35,273
It's seven o'clock,
I'm going to the new station.

175
00:21:36,397 --> 00:21:40,072
You take over here
till Weaver comes in at four.

176
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:46,152
All you do is answer the telephone
and send over any strays.

177
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:50,117
Maybe some still think
this is a police station.

178
00:21:56,838 --> 00:21:59,477
Are there any facilities left here?

179
00:22:00,318 --> 00:22:02,434
Couple of cells and a bathroom.

180
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:05,633
Why is this place still open?

181
00:22:05,718 --> 00:22:08,437
Well, it is and it isn't, Lieutenant.

182
00:22:08,518 --> 00:22:10,827
The result of transition.

183
00:22:10,918 --> 00:22:13,307
I think someone in central office

184
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:17,677
wanted to give you something special
for your first night out.

185
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:22,754
That sure got around fast.

186
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:32,948
(Sighs )

187
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:31,919
(Ice cream van chimes )

188
00:23:56,122 --> 00:23:58,158
(Chiming continues )

189
00:24:08,803 --> 00:24:10,919
(Tyres screech)

190
00:24:40,924 --> 00:24:42,880
(Coughing)

191
00:24:49,324 --> 00:24:52,282
I'm going to talk to Wilson.
Watch me.

192
00:25:02,885 --> 00:25:05,558
Don't mind if I sit down,
do you, Wilson?

193
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:08,796
- Got a smoke?
- You asked me before.

194
00:25:08,885 --> 00:25:10,921
I never got a definite answer.

195
00:25:11,005 --> 00:25:12,643
I don't smoke.

196
00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:14,681
That's a definite answer.

197
00:25:16,285 --> 00:25:18,241
Another one gone.

198
00:25:19,165 --> 00:25:22,920
When you're in my position
days are like women.

199
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:26,594
Each one is so goddam precious...

200
00:25:26,686 --> 00:25:29,200
and they always end up leaving you.

201
00:25:30,566 --> 00:25:32,443
What do you want?

202
00:25:32,526 --> 00:25:36,121
- Do I have to want something?
- You're a cop.

203
00:25:36,206 --> 00:25:40,404
You're either curious about me
or you want to give me some shit.

204
00:25:40,486 --> 00:25:42,716
I don't understand you, Wilson.

205
00:25:43,846 --> 00:25:45,598
Curious.

206
00:25:46,526 --> 00:25:49,963
You're not a psychopath,
you're not stupid...

207
00:25:50,047 --> 00:25:51,799
I am an asshole.

208
00:25:51,887 --> 00:25:54,321
Can't take everything away from me.

209
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:57,323
Why did you kill those men?

210
00:26:02,287 --> 00:26:05,040
Everybody asks me the same question.

211
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,997
I always tell 'em the same thing.

212
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:14,125
First time
I ever saw a preacher he said,

213
00:26:14,207 --> 00:26:17,405
"Son, there's something
strange about you.

214
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:20,082
"You got something to do with death."

215
00:26:21,328 --> 00:26:23,762
Being real young, I believed him.

216
00:26:24,808 --> 00:26:26,764
Turned out he was right.

217
00:26:26,848 --> 00:26:29,157
That's no answer.

218
00:26:30,648 --> 00:26:32,798
I thought it was pretty good.

219
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:35,721
Where'd you get a name like Napoleon?

220
00:26:36,648 --> 00:26:39,606
- I'll tell you some time.
- When?

221
00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:42,605
The moment of dying.

222
00:26:43,489 --> 00:26:46,720
I'll do my best to be there
when your time comes.

223
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:50,325
(Coughing violently)

224
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:53,242
Hey!

225
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,121
He's really sick.

226
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:07,197
The warden said it was only a cold.

227
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:10,248
The man is sick.

228
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:21,723
- How long till we get to Senora?
- Another six hours.

229
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,806
We gotta stop.

230
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,406
What's the closest precinct?

231
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,929
Anderson.

232
00:28:03,972 --> 00:28:06,930
(Ice cream van chimes )

233
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:16,610
Desconco to Pinehurst...

234
00:28:16,692 --> 00:28:18,045
Daddy!

235
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:20,566
- Glenoaks?
- Daddy!

236
00:28:20,652 --> 00:28:22,404
Daddy, the ice cream man.

237
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,448
Wait a second, Margaret.

238
00:28:26,692 --> 00:28:28,684
(Chimes continue )

239
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:49,525
Here you go.

240
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:52,571
OK...uh, Fabio Place?

241
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:59,724
Carunso...I mean
Desconco to Glenoaks, right?

242
00:29:00,974 --> 00:29:02,965
Right. Then I...

243
00:29:10,734 --> 00:29:12,690
Can I get an ice cream?

244
00:29:13,814 --> 00:29:16,282
It's late, sweetheart. I'm closed.

245
00:29:16,374 --> 00:29:18,330
Your music's still playing.

246
00:29:18,414 --> 00:29:20,371
(Chimes stop )

247
00:29:29,855 --> 00:29:32,244
Please, can't I get an ice cream?

248
00:29:33,895 --> 00:29:36,250
- What flavour?
- Vanilla twist.

249
00:29:56,256 --> 00:29:57,814
Jesus! Come on!

250
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:01,571
I'll give you my money,
just don't hurt me - please!

251
00:30:22,217 --> 00:30:25,448
Hey, this is regular vanilla.

252
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:32,929
I wanted vanilla twist.

253
00:30:37,817 --> 00:30:39,773
(Silenced gunshots )

254
00:30:47,898 --> 00:30:51,254
OK, Margaret,
I'll see you in a few minutes. Bye.

255
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:16,095
(Sobs )

256
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:19,053
(Car engine starts )

257
00:31:29,459 --> 00:31:33,772
Gun...in the truck under the dash...

258
00:33:07,063 --> 00:33:09,816
- Hello.
- Special Officer Starker.

259
00:33:09,903 --> 00:33:11,461
Ethan Bishop.

260
00:33:11,543 --> 00:33:14,535
I'm on my way to Senora
with three prisoners.

261
00:33:14,623 --> 00:33:17,057
One's sick and I think it's serious.

262
00:33:17,143 --> 00:33:18,496
What is it?

263
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:21,974
I'd like to put him in here
until I can call a doctor.

264
00:33:22,064 --> 00:33:23,861
I guess you missed the sign.

265
00:33:23,944 --> 00:33:27,300
The station isn't here.
It's being relocated.

266
00:33:27,384 --> 00:33:28,976
But you're here.

267
00:33:29,064 --> 00:33:31,624
Waiting for the electricity
to go off.

268
00:33:31,704 --> 00:33:34,343
So I can't put him
in your holding tanks?

269
00:33:34,424 --> 00:33:38,702
If you get back on the main boulevard
and go about 10 blocks...

270
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:40,900
I don't have time to discuss it.

271
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:44,863
If what that man has is infectious,
then all of us'll have it.

272
00:33:44,944 --> 00:33:48,858
The sooner we put him in the
holding tanks and I call a doctor...

273
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:52,221
- OK. Bring him in.
- Thanks.

274
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:48,700
Isn't that...overdoing it a little?

275
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:50,743
Napoleon Wilson.

276
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:53,623
No kidding?

277
00:35:00,587 --> 00:35:02,543
Got a smoke?

278
00:35:03,347 --> 00:35:05,816
No. Sorry.

279
00:35:08,388 --> 00:35:13,826
Well...if you see one floating
around...snag it for me, will you?

280
00:35:27,228 --> 00:35:30,777
- There may be a sick man here.
- Just passing through.

281
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:55,067
I have to admit it, Wilson,
you do have some fancy moves.

282
00:35:55,149 --> 00:35:57,822
For a man in leg-irons.

283
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,106
(Car engine purrs )

284
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,466
(Tyres screech)

285
00:36:38,271 --> 00:36:40,501
(Silenced gunshots )

286
00:38:36,115 --> 00:38:39,711
Come on, pull yourself together!
Speak up!

287
00:38:41,036 --> 00:38:42,992
Speak up!

288
00:38:45,196 --> 00:38:47,152
Lieutenant!

289
00:38:48,556 --> 00:38:50,308
- (Whispers )
- Who?

290
00:38:50,396 --> 00:38:53,354
- What...?
- Lot of action for a closed station.

291
00:38:53,436 --> 00:38:56,712
Ease up, Chaney. He can't talk.

292
00:38:56,796 --> 00:38:58,991
He said somebody's following him.

293
00:39:00,876 --> 00:39:02,832
All right, who?

294
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:07,035
Come on... Operator,
I have been waiting 10 minutes.

295
00:39:07,117 --> 00:39:09,790
(Starker talking in background)

296
00:39:24,117 --> 00:39:25,789
Yes, I'll con...

297
00:39:25,877 --> 00:39:28,596
Continue holding. Police doctors(!)

298
00:39:30,438 --> 00:39:32,269
Just a minute, calm down...

299
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:34,314
There's nobody out there.

300
00:39:35,718 --> 00:39:39,108
Chaney, help me take him
to the captain's office.

301
00:39:39,198 --> 00:39:40,392
Hello?!

302
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,434
I just got cut off.

303
00:39:43,518 --> 00:39:46,510
- Do we have a blanket somewhere?
- Yeah.

304
00:39:46,598 --> 00:39:49,032
Keep him warm. I'll call the doctor.

305
00:39:49,118 --> 00:39:53,475
Good luck. I got cut off and now
I can't even get a dial tone.

306
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,914
- They didn't cut you off.
- What?

307
00:39:59,999 --> 00:40:01,557
It's dead.

308
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:03,755
(Bishop ) Maybe they
shut it off early.

309
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,795
That's it, I'm leaving.

310
00:40:05,879 --> 00:40:09,428
You run this station
like chicken night in Turkey.

311
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:10,918
Thanks a lot!

312
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:19,910
He was mumbling
about his daughter being shot.

313
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:22,229
- Where?
- I don't know.

314
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:25,276
What about the phone?

315
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,557
- Now what?
- Power failure?

316
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,949
The streetlights are still on.

317
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,992
I'll call Ellendale
on the two-way in my car.

318
00:40:53,681 --> 00:40:55,239
(Silenced shots )

319
00:40:58,281 --> 00:41:00,875
(Laughs ) Chaney just fell down.

320
00:41:17,322 --> 00:41:19,074
(Gunshots )

321
00:41:26,642 --> 00:41:28,234
He didn't fall.

322
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:29,880
He was shot.

323
00:41:29,962 --> 00:41:31,475
(Julie ) What?!

324
00:41:31,562 --> 00:41:33,553
Couldn't tell if he's alive.

325
00:41:33,642 --> 00:41:37,794
- There wasn't any sound...
- They're using silencers.

326
00:41:43,763 --> 00:41:45,958
(Bishop ) They're in those trees.

327
00:41:46,043 --> 00:41:49,513
Why would anybody
shoot at a police station?

328
00:41:55,483 --> 00:41:57,439
Starker! Lock the doors!

329
00:41:57,523 --> 00:41:59,479
Stay away from the windows!

330
00:42:05,243 --> 00:42:09,122
(Starker) No lights... With
the Highway Patrol running things,

331
00:42:09,203 --> 00:42:10,717
it's amateur night!

332
00:42:10,804 --> 00:42:12,442
(Silenced gunshots )

333
00:42:15,084 --> 00:42:16,597
(Silenced gunshots )

334
00:42:21,964 --> 00:42:24,717
(Wilson ) Open this door! Let me in!

335
00:42:25,164 --> 00:42:26,961
(Silenced gunshots )

336
00:42:30,204 --> 00:42:32,160
Come on!

337
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:04,839
(Wells) You're gonna
leave us here?!

338
00:43:04,926 --> 00:43:07,076
At least take these cuffs off!

339
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:09,122
Hey, pig!

340
00:43:10,926 --> 00:43:13,486
(Sustained silenced gunfire )

341
00:44:29,289 --> 00:44:31,041
(Gunfire slows )

342
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:37,684
(Gunfire stops )

343
00:45:31,131 --> 00:45:32,883
Leigh...

344
00:45:39,491 --> 00:45:42,245
I want you to stay at the window.

345
00:45:46,692 --> 00:45:48,648
I'll be right back.

346
00:45:52,492 --> 00:45:54,244
You both all right?

347
00:45:54,332 --> 00:45:56,288
Fabulous, as usual.

348
00:45:56,372 --> 00:45:58,647
What's happening out there?

349
00:46:07,092 --> 00:46:11,405
Hey, come on! We got a right
to know what's happening!

350
00:46:11,493 --> 00:46:13,245
Hey!

351
00:46:13,893 --> 00:46:15,724
Left out again.

352
00:46:15,813 --> 00:46:19,203
Life just seems to pass us by,
doesn't it?

353
00:46:27,173 --> 00:46:29,971
I think they're gone,
I can't see anyone.

354
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:34,251
- Is there a back way out?
- Past the holding tanks at the rear.

355
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,290
We're blocked off back there.

356
00:46:36,374 --> 00:46:37,932
How come?

357
00:46:38,014 --> 00:46:40,892
There's a big wall
with barbed wire around it.

358
00:46:40,974 --> 00:46:43,886
The only way out
is to come around the front.

359
00:46:44,774 --> 00:46:46,287
Come with me.

360
00:47:00,894 --> 00:47:03,489
What about the houses
behind the wall?.

361
00:47:03,575 --> 00:47:06,726
All the houses
are condemned and boarded up.

362
00:47:06,815 --> 00:47:08,567
No one lives nearby?

363
00:47:08,655 --> 00:47:11,613
There are two houses
at the end of the block.

364
00:47:12,695 --> 00:47:14,651
How far away are they?

365
00:47:14,735 --> 00:47:17,090
Five, six hundred yards.

366
00:47:32,296 --> 00:47:35,845
- So no one nearby heard anything.
- That's impossible!

367
00:47:37,376 --> 00:47:39,936
They're using silencers -
no gunshots.

368
00:47:40,016 --> 00:47:42,735
The only sounds are
the windows breaking.

369
00:47:42,816 --> 00:47:45,091
Somebody could have heard that!

370
00:47:46,696 --> 00:47:49,415
I really think they're gone,
I mean...

371
00:47:49,496 --> 00:47:51,214
Take a look.

372
00:48:00,977 --> 00:48:03,172
I found a box of magnesium flares.

373
00:48:03,257 --> 00:48:04,815
No flare gun.

374
00:48:04,897 --> 00:48:06,250
Figures.

375
00:48:06,337 --> 00:48:08,293
Try to get that open.

376
00:48:13,937 --> 00:48:17,088
Nothing. Not a goddam thing moving.

377
00:48:17,177 --> 00:48:20,966
See?! Just look outside.
They're gone.

378
00:48:22,058 --> 00:48:24,014
Look, I can't get this open.

379
00:48:35,258 --> 00:48:37,214
Damn thing's solid.

380
00:48:37,298 --> 00:48:40,131
We should be
figuring a way to get out!

381
00:48:40,218 --> 00:48:42,778
You got any suggestions?! Huh?

382
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:52,218
We're gonna stay here and hold
until somebody comes, OK?

383
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:56,133
We're in the middle of a city,
inside a police station.

384
00:48:56,219 --> 00:48:59,211
Someone's bound to
drive by eventually.

385
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:05,091
It may take 15-20 minutes,
but they'll come.

386
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,810
It doesn't look like
they've cut our phone lines.

387
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,334
They're still connected to the pole.

388
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,492
I bet they took out
a whole pole down the block.

389
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,536
What does that mean?

390
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,658
If the phone lines are down in
the area no one nearby can call in.

391
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:35,177
(Julie ) Doesn't the phone company
know where there's a line down?

392
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:38,935
(Bishop ) Wait a minute.
There they are.

393
00:50:21,542 --> 00:50:23,976
(Bishop ) They've set up a roadblock.

394
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,018
(Julie ) Someone's coming!

395
00:51:23,464 --> 00:51:25,819
What does that mean?

396
00:51:30,185 --> 00:51:33,336
It means we've just been marked
for something.

397
00:51:33,425 --> 00:51:35,575
Let me guess what it is.

398
00:51:36,705 --> 00:51:38,661
This is a siege.

399
00:51:38,745 --> 00:51:41,305
It's a goddam siege!

400
00:51:47,745 --> 00:51:49,497
He's the one they want.

401
00:51:51,385 --> 00:51:54,139
Why don't we give him to them?

402
00:51:56,746 --> 00:51:59,465
Don't give me that civilised look!

403
00:52:01,746 --> 00:52:05,580
This is my station tonight
and he came in here for help.

404
00:52:05,666 --> 00:52:08,464
He's gonna get
all the help we can give him.

405
00:52:11,826 --> 00:52:13,703
Very nice, Lieutenant.

406
00:52:13,786 --> 00:52:15,504
Thank you.

407
00:52:16,906 --> 00:52:17,861
No!

408
00:52:19,466 --> 00:52:21,105
(Silenced gunshots )

409
00:52:23,147 --> 00:52:24,899
Get them out of the cells.

410
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:47,387
(Wells) Come on, baby! Hurry it up!

411
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:55,176
(Leigh) OK. Get out front.

412
00:52:55,268 --> 00:52:57,020
- OK.
- Quick!

413
00:52:57,108 --> 00:52:58,382
Move!

414
00:53:05,868 --> 00:53:08,018
(Banging at door)

415
00:53:12,228 --> 00:53:13,981
(Door crashes open )

416
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:37,942
(Crack)

417
00:53:38,029 --> 00:53:39,304
Hah!

418
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:50,261
Give me a gun!

419
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:51,988
They're coming down the hall!

420
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:56,268
I can't hold it!

421
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:58,261
Shit!

422
00:53:58,350 --> 00:53:59,465
(Gunshots )

423
00:54:06,031 --> 00:54:07,464
(Gunshots )

424
00:54:33,072 --> 00:54:34,664
The window!

425
00:54:45,312 --> 00:54:46,870
Watch the front!

426
00:57:09,197 --> 00:57:10,550
Julie?

427
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,553
Wilson!

428
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:23,110
We'd better barricade that door,
give me a hand.

429
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,556
Wells, watch the front
and the two offices.

430
00:59:19,882 --> 00:59:22,521
You saved my life. Twice.

431
00:59:23,762 --> 00:59:27,233
- Twice?
- First time outside by the bus.

432
00:59:27,323 --> 00:59:30,952
Figure that was a mistake
on your part. I let it go.

433
00:59:31,043 --> 00:59:35,116
Then you did it again when you
pulled us out of the cells.

434
00:59:35,843 --> 00:59:38,801
You must be serious
about keeping me alive.

435
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,552
I want all of us alive.

436
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:47,517
This time I know somebody heard us.

437
00:59:47,603 --> 00:59:50,596
There'll be squad cars here
in five minutes.

438
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:09,082
Acetylene.

439
01:00:11,084 --> 01:00:13,200
If a stray bullet had hit this...

440
01:00:13,284 --> 01:00:14,876
(Wells) Look at this!

441
01:00:25,165 --> 01:00:26,723
How is it?

442
01:00:26,805 --> 01:00:30,241
I can't move it and it hurts
like a son of a bitch.

443
01:00:36,605 --> 01:00:38,482
It was close timing.

444
01:00:38,565 --> 01:00:40,203
You were good.

445
01:00:42,525 --> 01:00:46,155
If I'd been any good in here
maybe she'd still be alive.

446
01:00:58,166 --> 01:00:59,918
They moved the car.

447
01:01:00,006 --> 01:01:04,284
I can't believe it. They parked
them where they were before.

448
01:01:05,686 --> 01:01:07,278
Why'd they do that?

449
01:01:07,366 --> 01:01:11,758
From a distance the street
looks normal - like nothing happened.

450
01:01:11,847 --> 01:01:13,803
Like nothing happened?!

451
01:01:14,847 --> 01:01:18,840
They shot five police officers,
a secretary, one prisoner!

452
01:01:18,927 --> 01:01:21,566
And we killed a dozen of them!

453
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:24,805
Where are the bodies?

454
01:01:38,688 --> 01:01:40,485
They took them away.

455
01:01:46,608 --> 01:01:50,681
- How'd they do it so fast?
- Got the Good Fairy to help them?

456
01:01:50,768 --> 01:01:53,123
You really are a smart-ass!

457
01:01:58,048 --> 01:02:00,562
Prison bus is gone,
so are the bodies.

458
01:02:00,648 --> 01:02:03,117
They dragged old Starker away.

459
01:02:04,209 --> 01:02:05,642
(Cocks pistol)

460
01:02:05,729 --> 01:02:09,278
Too bad. I promised
to tell him something.

461
01:02:09,369 --> 01:02:13,920
What's going on?
What are they doing out there?

462
01:02:14,009 --> 01:02:18,002
They're hiding every sign
that they attacked this building.

463
01:02:18,089 --> 01:02:22,241
What I wanna know is...
what started all this?

464
01:02:24,689 --> 01:02:26,520
Came running in here...

465
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:29,966
Jesus Christ, 30 minutes ago!

466
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:32,610
All of this for one man?

467
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:34,646
Don't forget the cholo.

468
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:37,561
They delivered it to us.

469
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:40,243
Cholo?

470
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:43,242
You look like
somebody spit in your socks.

471
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:47,209
No one said anything about the cholo.

472
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:49,440
All right, what does it mean?

473
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:53,126
It means they don't care.

474
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:56,484
(Sighs )

475
01:02:56,571 --> 01:02:58,926
They're not afraid to die -
any of 'em.

476
01:02:59,011 --> 01:03:03,607
They want to rip us apart,
no matter what it costs.

477
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:05,409
It means...

478
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:07,402
to the death.

479
01:03:07,491 --> 01:03:09,288
How do you know?

480
01:03:09,371 --> 01:03:13,922
I spent some time in a cell
with some crazy young bastards once.

481
01:03:15,051 --> 01:03:16,803
This can't happen.

482
01:03:16,891 --> 01:03:19,246
Not in...in the middle of a city!

483
01:03:20,331 --> 01:03:22,083
Not today.

484
01:03:22,171 --> 01:03:24,242
Pinch me to wake me up.

485
01:03:24,332 --> 01:03:26,971
There was gunfire
for a minute and a half...

486
01:03:27,052 --> 01:03:29,008
Two minutes!

487
01:03:29,812 --> 01:03:32,042
I can't believe no one heard us.

488
01:03:32,132 --> 01:03:35,124
Maybe they heard it.
What do they see?

489
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:38,443
An empty street,
empty police station.

490
01:03:38,532 --> 01:03:41,922
Maybe somebody
from the new precinct will come by.

491
01:03:42,012 --> 01:03:47,405
In the meantime, I've got this plan,
it's called "Save Ass".

492
01:03:48,652 --> 01:03:53,169
It works like this, I slip out
a window and run like a bastard.

493
01:03:53,253 --> 01:03:54,845
(Bishop ) Wells...

494
01:03:56,493 --> 01:03:58,802
You know I can't let you do that.

495
01:03:58,893 --> 01:04:01,566
I'm not asking you to let me.

496
01:04:01,653 --> 01:04:03,848
They'll cut you down within 10 feet.

497
01:04:03,933 --> 01:04:06,970
- You're on his side?
- No sides to it.

498
01:04:07,053 --> 01:04:09,362
We're all together.

499
01:04:12,373 --> 01:04:15,126
I've been shot once tonight.

500
01:04:16,414 --> 01:04:18,928
I don't feel like a second time.

501
01:04:23,334 --> 01:04:27,247
I want to say one thing
before you jump out that window.

502
01:04:27,334 --> 01:04:31,566
When they drag you off I'll lean out
and ask them to say a prayer

503
01:04:31,654 --> 01:04:33,804
as they dump you in some vacant lot

504
01:04:33,894 --> 01:04:36,362
next to the
five other police officers

505
01:04:36,454 --> 01:04:38,684
and your sick handcuffed friend.

506
01:04:46,175 --> 01:04:49,565
I go through all that
and his gun isn't even loaded.

507
01:04:53,335 --> 01:04:55,291
(Wells laughs )

508
01:04:56,495 --> 01:04:58,565
(Gun clicks empty )

509
01:04:58,655 --> 01:05:01,294
That damn silencer!

510
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:05,414
I've been clicking off empty shots
all night and I didn't even know it.

511
01:05:09,416 --> 01:05:11,725
(Wilson ) VERY close timing.

512
01:05:11,816 --> 01:05:13,772
You are good.

513
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:17,213
Sometimes.

514
01:05:18,936 --> 01:05:21,086
Problem is, he's not alone.

515
01:05:23,256 --> 01:05:26,214
Goddam thing's got three shots left.
Wilson?

516
01:05:26,296 --> 01:05:28,526
- Three rounds.
- Leigh?

517
01:05:28,616 --> 01:05:30,015
Two shots.

518
01:05:30,096 --> 01:05:34,009
If there's any spare ammunition
I don't know where it is.

519
01:05:44,617 --> 01:05:46,573
Anybody got a smoke?

520
01:05:57,817 --> 01:05:59,773
Got a light?

521
01:06:28,339 --> 01:06:30,295
(Radio ) 'One-X-five,

522
01:06:30,379 --> 01:06:35,134

Everything looks normal, nothing
unusual to report at this time.

530
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:08,090
'they will be sent into your area.

531
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:10,614
'All helicopters
are in use at this time.'

532
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:13,453
We can't find anything
without back-up.

533
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:15,735
Damned Saturday night overload.

534
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:18,969
This is unit seven, 10-4.

535
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:23,336
Don't you wanna check that street?

536
01:07:23,421 --> 01:07:25,855
- That's Gramsci, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

537
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:29,331
- Just the old station there.
- We should cruise it.

538
01:07:29,421 --> 01:07:31,173
What for?

539
01:07:39,141 --> 01:07:40,699
(Bishop ) It'll work.

540
01:07:40,781 --> 01:07:42,134
You're crazy!

541
01:07:42,221 --> 01:07:44,416
- Sure about the basement?
- Yes.

542
01:07:44,501 --> 01:07:46,776
- What if you're wrong?
- I said...

543
01:07:46,861 --> 01:07:49,422
- But if you're wrong!
- I know this place.

544
01:08:01,302 --> 01:08:03,054
Looks pretty good to me.

545
01:08:03,142 --> 01:08:06,452
Looks like hell,
but it's all we've got.

546
01:08:06,542 --> 01:08:08,533
Who goes?

547
01:08:10,222 --> 01:08:13,612
I gotta tell you,
I don't know how to hot-wire a car.

548
01:08:15,183 --> 01:08:17,139
I'm a cop.

549
01:08:18,583 --> 01:08:20,574
Between me and Snow White.

550
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:22,016
Shit!

551
01:08:22,103 --> 01:08:24,059
Shit, shit!

552
01:08:24,503 --> 01:08:28,462
- We haven't flipped a coin yet.
- I'm gonna lose.

553
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:31,011
You got a bad attitude, Wells.

554
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:33,173
I always lose.

555
01:08:33,263 --> 01:08:36,221
How do you think I ended up in here?

556
01:08:36,303 --> 01:08:38,658
Maybe it'll change.

557
01:08:38,943 --> 01:08:42,653
It might...if we don't flip a coin.

558
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:45,133
- Let's do something else.
- What?

559
01:08:45,224 --> 01:08:46,657
'Taters.

560
01:08:49,544 --> 01:08:51,500
OK.

561
01:08:55,704 --> 01:08:58,059
(Both) One potato, two potato,
three potato, four.

562
01:08:58,144 --> 01:08:59,543
Five potato, six potato,
seven potato, more.

563
01:08:59,624 --> 01:09:00,977
Eight potato, nine potato,
ten potato, eleven.

564
01:09:01,064 --> 01:09:02,338
Kiss my ass and go to heaven.

565
01:09:02,424 --> 01:09:03,777
Y-O-U spells you!

566
01:09:03,864 --> 01:09:05,980
I said I'd lose. Do it again.

567
01:09:06,064 --> 01:09:08,215
Hey, there isn't time.

568
01:09:10,585 --> 01:09:14,214
- How come she's out?
- Can I do it with one arm?

569
01:09:17,345 --> 01:09:20,701
Still no sign of them.
Let's get moving.

570
01:09:20,785 --> 01:09:24,903
- Want me to show you where it is?
- I'll take him down. You stay here.

571
01:09:29,025 --> 01:09:30,981
It's next to the furnace.

572
01:09:35,106 --> 01:09:37,142
Nobody gonna wish me luck?

573
01:09:37,866 --> 01:09:40,016
(Both) Good luck.

574
01:09:40,266 --> 01:09:43,417
Look at that,
two cops wishing me luck.

575
01:09:43,506 --> 01:09:45,098
I'm doomed.

576
01:10:12,307 --> 01:10:14,263
Five feet down.

577
01:10:14,347 --> 01:10:17,259
- To the sewer?
- 20 yards straight ahead.

578
01:10:17,347 --> 01:10:20,100
- The manhole.
- Right.

579
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:23,584
I wanna know,
what's the difference between this

580
01:10:23,667 --> 01:10:26,306
and what I was gonna do
10 minutes ago?

581
01:10:27,388 --> 01:10:30,425
- No difference.
- But you stopped me then.

582
01:10:30,508 --> 01:10:32,703
Why not now?

583
01:10:34,268 --> 01:10:37,704
One thing - when you get out
make sure you call the cops

584
01:10:37,788 --> 01:10:39,858
before you head for the border.

585
01:10:41,628 --> 01:10:43,858
What makes you think I'd do that?

586
01:10:45,868 --> 01:10:47,824
I'll see you, Wilson.

587
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:39,303
That basement's not a bad place to be
if they come at us again.

588
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:41,620
The only way in is that long hallway.

589
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:45,180
We might be able to hold 'em...
a couple of minutes.

590
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:46,784
We'd be trapped.

591
01:11:46,871 --> 01:11:49,783
We won't last up here
with only eight shots.

592
01:11:49,871 --> 01:11:52,863
The upstairs is out.
It's wide open up there.

593
01:11:55,671 --> 01:11:59,107
(Bishop sighs ) Someone will come.

594
01:12:00,871 --> 01:12:04,102
A man with faith. A rare quality.

595
01:12:06,351 --> 01:12:08,307
What about you?

596
01:12:08,391 --> 01:12:12,100
I've never had much faith
in anyone coming to my rescue.

597
01:12:12,191 --> 01:12:15,423
(Wilson ) You associated
with the wrong people.

598
01:12:15,512 --> 01:12:18,265
I've been with policemen
for five years.

599
01:12:18,352 --> 01:12:20,422
Enough to grow hair on a rock.

600
01:12:22,352 --> 01:12:25,503
- And you?
- I believe in one man.

601
01:12:25,592 --> 01:12:27,423
Hey, he's there!

602
01:12:30,272 --> 01:12:32,183
Stay clear. Move!

603
01:12:38,512 --> 01:12:40,185
What's he waiting for?

604
01:12:42,433 --> 01:12:44,583
He's clear in front.

605
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:48,183
Move, damn it!

606
01:12:50,873 --> 01:12:53,023
He's out.

607
01:13:01,593 --> 01:13:03,231
Go, you son of a bitch.

608
01:13:08,194 --> 01:13:09,912
They've seen him.

609
01:13:13,914 --> 01:13:16,428
Save it for us.

610
01:13:29,074 --> 01:13:31,224
He made it! He's made it!

611
01:13:33,195 --> 01:13:34,753
(Starts engine )

612
01:13:44,275 --> 01:13:46,584
- Go! Go!
- Hit it! Hit it!

613
01:13:49,835 --> 01:13:51,826
He's gonna make it.

614
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:55,147
(Tyres screech)

615
01:14:00,716 --> 01:14:02,115
(Silenced gunshot)

616
01:14:09,556 --> 01:14:12,024
Maybe it was just a window breaking.

617
01:14:19,716 --> 01:14:21,274
(Bishop ) Wretched...

618
01:14:23,556 --> 01:14:25,512
Too bad, Wells.

619
01:14:26,597 --> 01:14:28,747
You never got to see the border.

620
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:34,356
We'd better get down
in that basement.

621
01:14:34,437 --> 01:14:37,270
We're out of time,
out of ammunition...

622
01:14:37,357 --> 01:14:40,793
Just like Wells, we're out of luck.
Take a look.

623
01:14:49,797 --> 01:14:51,753
Let's go.

624
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:45,790
(Wilson ) We can make one last stand.

625
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:50,317
Take that sign, put it down the
hallway, it'll help stand 'em off.

626
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,119
What do we use
to hold them back with?

627
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,350
Anything we can find.

628
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:06,669
- Still have a gun?
- Two shots. Do I save it for us two?

629
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:09,752
Save 'em for the first two
through that vent.

630
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,800
They're bound to have seen Wells
come through the manhole.

631
01:16:13,881 --> 01:16:17,032
What do I use on the rest of them?

632
01:16:17,121 --> 01:16:19,874
Then you'll have to wing it.

633
01:16:20,121 --> 01:16:24,319
None of us know who he is, what
happened to him or what he's done.

634
01:16:25,441 --> 01:16:28,274
(Leigh) He could be anybody
or anything.

635
01:16:29,281 --> 01:16:31,317
I'm curious about one thing.

636
01:16:31,401 --> 01:16:33,357
Just one?

637
01:16:34,441 --> 01:16:38,799
There are other things, but at the
moment this interests me the most.

638
01:16:38,882 --> 01:16:40,759
What's that?

639
01:16:40,842 --> 01:16:44,721
Why didn't you climb down that vent
and take off?

640
01:16:44,802 --> 01:16:48,033
There are two things
a man should never run from,

641
01:16:48,122 --> 01:16:50,078
even if they cost him his life.

642
01:16:50,162 --> 01:16:52,960
One is a man who's helpless
and can't run.

643
01:16:53,042 --> 01:16:55,237
What's the other?

644
01:16:59,242 --> 01:17:01,676
(Bishop ) Come here a minute, Wilson.

645
01:17:04,042 --> 01:17:07,080
The least of our problems
is we're out of time.

646
01:17:07,163 --> 01:17:09,597
It's an old story with me.

647
01:17:10,683 --> 01:17:12,639
I was born out of time.

648
01:17:24,763 --> 01:17:27,914
Acetylene tank, magnesium flares.

649
01:17:28,003 --> 01:17:32,475
We strap the flares onto the tank,
tie them on that plank,

650
01:17:32,564 --> 01:17:35,124
I stand in the doorway with my rifle,

651
01:17:35,204 --> 01:17:38,116
I shoot the flares,
they ignite the tank.

652
01:17:38,204 --> 01:17:42,356
We blow the hell
out of everybody in this hallway!

653
01:17:42,764 --> 01:17:45,642
What stops it
blowing the hell out of us?

654
01:17:46,764 --> 01:17:50,723
You hold up that sign
in front of the door for cover.

655
01:17:51,804 --> 01:17:55,956
- Can you hit it from there?
- I got three shots, that's enough.

656
01:17:58,525 --> 01:18:00,755
Can't argue with a confident man.

657
01:18:00,845 --> 01:18:02,642
Let's go.

658
01:18:11,285 --> 01:18:15,563
This is unit seven, we've checked
between Gramsci and Imperial.

659
01:18:15,645 --> 01:18:19,433
Dark, quiet and deserted.
Request instructions, over.

660
01:18:19,525 --> 01:18:21,641
What are those cars doing there?

661
01:18:21,725 --> 01:18:26,197
There's a few people on duty
moving things out of there.

662
01:18:26,286 --> 01:18:29,756
They're probably between here
and the new station.

663
01:18:29,846 --> 01:18:31,996
We're wasting time here.

664
01:18:50,326 --> 01:18:52,363
- I don't know.
- Huh?

665
01:18:52,447 --> 01:18:54,881
There's something funny back there.

666
01:18:54,967 --> 01:18:57,925
(Radio ) 'We have
continued reports of gunfire.'

667
01:18:58,007 --> 01:18:59,963
We don't hear a thing!

668
01:19:00,047 --> 01:19:04,325
'Most reports are unable to pinpoint
the location of the gunfire.'

669
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:08,719
'The telephone repair vehicle
is officially reported lost.

670
01:19:08,807 --> 01:19:12,356
'We are sending four back-up units
in to assist you.'

671
01:19:12,447 --> 01:19:15,996
This is unit seven.
Still nothing unusual to report.

672
01:19:16,087 --> 01:19:18,238
We cannot locate the gunfire.

673
01:19:18,328 --> 01:19:22,116
Repeat request for immediate
helicopter surveillance.

674
01:19:22,208 --> 01:19:26,326
'One-X-five, when helicopter
is available we will send it in.'

675
01:19:26,408 --> 01:19:28,319
Unit seven, 10-4.

676
01:19:30,888 --> 01:19:33,197
There's something wrong here.

677
01:19:33,288 --> 01:19:37,804
Listen to that, it's starting
to rain. Just what we need(!)

678
01:19:37,888 --> 01:19:40,960
There's something funny
about that station.

679
01:19:41,048 --> 01:19:45,679
Wait, that's not rain...
What the hell is that?

680
01:19:53,009 --> 01:19:54,681
Jesus Christ...

681
01:19:58,769 --> 01:20:03,684
This is unit seven, emergency
to all precincts and vehicles.

682
01:20:03,769 --> 01:20:05,088
Emergency! Emergency!

683
01:20:17,450 --> 01:20:19,406
(Explosions upstairs )

684
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:22,208
Molotov cocktails.

685
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:24,758
They'll set the goddam place on fire.

686
01:20:24,850 --> 01:20:26,966
This is it.

687
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:30,640
(Bishop ) Let's go.

688
01:20:52,171 --> 01:20:54,127
(Explosion upstairs )

689
01:21:00,611 --> 01:21:02,567
(Glass smashes upstairs )

690
01:21:09,692 --> 01:21:11,045
(Glass smashes )

691
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:13,088
(Bishop whistles )

692
01:21:22,932 --> 01:21:24,888
Sorry.

693
01:21:25,332 --> 01:21:27,288
Kinda pretty.

694
01:21:30,853 --> 01:21:32,809
Can I ask you a question?

695
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:38,932
Being a cop I figured
you'd get around to it eventually.

696
01:21:41,893 --> 01:21:45,090
How did you come to be named
"Napoleon" Wilson?

697
01:21:45,173 --> 01:21:47,403
I'll tell you sometime.

698
01:21:47,493 --> 01:21:49,927
(Shouting and banging from upstairs )

699
01:21:50,013 --> 01:21:52,925
- When will you tell me?
- Maybe in a minute.

700
01:21:53,693 --> 01:21:55,172
(Crashing)

701
01:21:59,894 --> 01:22:01,407
(Gunshots )

702
01:22:07,134 --> 01:22:09,090
(Frenzied shouting)
