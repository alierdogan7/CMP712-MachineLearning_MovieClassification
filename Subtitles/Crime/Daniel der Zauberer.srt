00:17:05,184 --> 00:17:06,584
Let's start over again

186
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,308
We can manage the stuff with the notes.

187
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:10,332
[Daniel] Okay :-/

188
00:17:14,156 --> 00:17:18,156
[Tom] <i>To our Küblböck, who we hate beyond measure.</i>

189
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,680
Be quiet, I have to write this letter to Küblböck.

190
00:17:20,704 --> 00:17:22,704
[Rike] Man!

191
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:28,328
[Tom] <i>Don't think, that we will fall for</i>

192
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:32,852
<i>your faked love for the poor tigers</i>. [again, wtf?!]

193
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:36,976
<i>By the way, my girlfriend and I</i>

194
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,200
<i>don't live far from you, in Passau...</i>

195
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,724
<i>...which you will visit soon.</i>

196
00:17:41,748 --> 00:17:47,248
<i>Well, this won't happen, because we intent to...</i>

197
00:17:47,272 --> 00:17:51,272
<i>put an end to this tragedy.</i>

198
00:17:53,896 --> 00:17:56,396
[one of the greatest scenes of the movie-history incoming]

199
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,220
8-]

200
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:40,244
[Balthasar] Something wrong?

201
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:42,268
[Mysterious man] Dont you recognise me anymore?

202
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:44,792
[Balthasar] Not that i remember...

203
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:48,216
[Myst. Man] Munich. Oktoberfest 1965...

204
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,040
[Balthasar] Wait a moment... Johnny?!

205
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,764
No... He is long dead...

206
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:55,788
[Myst. Man] Who are you talking about?

207
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:58,312
[Balthasar] About Johann. Also called Johnny.

208
00:18:58,936 --> 00:19:00,936
[Myst. Man] I am exactly that Johnny.

209
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,960
[Balthasar] Yeah yeah, sure thing...!

210
00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:04,984
Have a nice day...

211
00:19:05,008 --> 00:19:07,008
[Johnny] About Daniel...

212
00:19:07,032 --> 00:19:09,732
You can get it out of your head, Balthasar.

213
00:19:09,756 --> 00:19:11,956
[Balthasar] How do you know my name?

214
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,580
[Johnny] If you, or your fellowship...

215
00:19:17,604 --> 00:19:19,604
... harm Daniel...

216
00:19:19,628 --> 00:19:22,028
...you will have to deal with me...

217
00:19:22,052 --> 00:19:24,052
[Balthasar] Quit playing games.

218
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:26,776
Johnny has been dead for at least 30 years.

219
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
[Johnny] Ghosts can also be dangerous!

220
00:19:28,824 --> 00:19:30,824
[Balthasar] Hehe! I'm sorry.

221
00:19:30,848 --> 00:19:32,648
I don't believe in ghosts.

222
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,672
[Johnny] I'm protecting Daniel...

223
00:19:34,696 --> 00:19:36,696
...and I always did.

224
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,620
[Johnny] You don't need to be afraid, Daniel.

225
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:58,044
Hm?

226
00:19:59,268 --> 00:20:01,268
Tell me...

227
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:03,292
...you can dream, right?

228
00:20:03,716 --> 00:20:05,716
Just start dreaming...

229
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,740
... and the rest...

230
00:20:07,764 --> 00:20:09,764
...will come automatically...

231
00:20:47,988 --> 00:20:49,988
[Balthasar] Even if you're right...

232
00:20:50,012 --> 00:20:52,812
... you will solely face a huge superior force...

233
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:55,236
Millions of people, who hate his guts.

234
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,560
[Johnny] Do you know small Petra?

235
00:20:57,584 --> 00:20:59,584
[Balthasar] Petra? What Petra?

236
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:01,608
[Johnny] You see?

237
00:21:01,632 --> 00:21:03,632
You have no idea...!

238
00:21:04,256 --> 00:21:06,256
Love...

239
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,280
... will prevail.

240
00:21:09,404 --> 00:21:11,404
>:-/

241
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:26,328
[?????????????????????????????????]

242
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,052
[Grandpa Winter] Is this supposed to be music, Petra?

243
00:21:29,076 --> 00:21:30,876
this is unbearable.

244
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,300
Is this the lunatic Küblböck, or what?

245
00:21:33,324 --> 00:21:35,324
[Petra] His name is Daniel, Grampa.

246
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:36,948
Also his music is super-duper!

247
00:21:36,972 --> 00:21:38,672
[Grandpa Winter] Nothing but pure garbage!

248
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:39,896
Lousy stuff!

249
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,320
I've had enough, turn it down.

250
00:21:41,344 --> 00:21:42,344
It's enough!

251
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,368
[Petra] If you didn't forbidden me to go to his concert...

252
00:21:44,392 --> 00:21:46,392
...you wouldn't have to listen to it now!

253
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:47,616
[Grandpa Winter] !!! Concert!

254
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,640
Well... I... He is stupid... he didn't learn anything...

255
00:21:49,664 --> 00:21:51,664
... he doesn't know anything about music!

256
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:53,688
That jumping-jack!

257
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,212
That... poor devil! [literally: poor sausage]

258
00:21:56,236 --> 00:21:57,936
In my shop... no-one likes that shit!

259
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
Am i right, Miss Selig?

260
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,984
[Selig] I totally aggree with you, Mr. Winter.

261
00:22:01,008 --> 00:22:03,008
That Küüüüüüüblböck!

262
00:22:03,032 --> 00:22:05,032
He is our cultural downfall!

263
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,656
It's a 100% total shit.

264
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,680
[Grandpa Winter] W-what is this?

265
00:22:09,104 --> 00:22:11,104
Küblböck!

266
00:22:11,128 --> 00:22:12,828
Unbelievable!

267
00:22:12,852 --> 00:22:14,852
Küblböck the whole year, only Küblböck?!

268
00:22:15,276 --> 00:22:17,276
That's impossible!

269
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,200
HEY HEY! I'M THE MAN IN THE MOOOON!

270
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:50,724
WATCHING YOUR WORLD FROM A BIG BALLOON!

271
00:22:50,748 --> 00:23:00,748
[Fun Fact: The character "Grandpa Winter" is played by this movies producer Peter Schamoni]

272
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:09,820
[Director Lommel first saw Daniel on TV and decided to visit his concert in Zirkus Krone.]

273
00:23:10,796 --> 00:23:19,796
[He was amazed at Daniels atmosphere and charisma and decided to make a movie about him]

274
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:29,200
[Producer Schamoni couldn't understand Lommels fascination with Daniel at first...]

275
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:39,844
[... but was soon won over by Daniels positive energy!]

276
00:23:40,868 --> 00:23:49,868
[Thats why he included himself playing the part of  "Grandpa Winter"!]

277
00:23:50,892 --> 00:23:59,892
[But will Daniel win over "Grandpa Winters" heart, as he did Schamonis? We will see...]

278
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,916
[This song should be over soon...]

279
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,940
[Soon...]

280
00:24:34,964 --> 00:24:36,964
[Real soon...]

281
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,988
[wow!]

282
00:24:55,012 --> 00:24:57,012
:-P

283
00:25:00,636 --> 00:25:01,636
:-P

284
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,660
[Finally!]

My Grampa ownes the Cafe Winter...

287
00:25:45,332 --> 00:25:47,932
... in your hometown Eggenfelden.

288
00:25:47,956 --> 00:25:53,156
It would be nice of you to visit us.

289
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,180
We even bake our own cakes!

290
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,240
I live without my parents...

291
00:25:59,528 --> 00:26:02,728
My Grandma also died last year...

292
00:26:03,452 --> 00:26:05,452
I'm thinking about you a lot.

293
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:07,476
And that makes me happy!

294
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
I love your music.

295
00:26:09,524 --> 00:26:12,824
And I always enjoy watching a new musicvideo by you

296
00:26:13,548 --> 00:26:15,548
See you soon!

297
00:26:15,572 --> 00:26:17,172
And lots of positive energy!

298
00:26:17,196 --> 00:26:18,496
Best wishes, Petra.

299
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,120
[Balthasar] Where is the little cockroach?

300
00:26:20,444 --> 00:26:22,644
Did you change your minds?

301
00:26:23,368 --> 00:26:25,368
Did he convert you?

302
00:26:27,092 --> 00:26:29,092
... made you cry?

303
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:33,816
Are you Daniel Küblböck-fans after all?

304
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,840
[Rike] Are you nuts?! Never!

305
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:38,864
[Tom] We will get him.

306
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,888
But it has to be spectacular.

307
00:26:41,312 --> 00:26:44,812
[Balthasar] On sunday is his last concert this year.

308
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,436
In Passau. His home.

309
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,560
He will fall in front of God and the world.

310
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:53,384
Pew, pew!

311
00:26:53,408 --> 00:26:54,808
[Tom] And we will sit front-row!

312
00:26:54,832 --> 00:26:55,832
[Rike] Bang, bang!

313
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:58,356
[Balthasar] And you will be more famous, than every superstar!

314
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,680
[Rike] Sounds great!

315
00:26:59,704 --> 00:27:00,804
[Balthasar] Feels good!

316
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,028
[Tom] No more Küblböck!

317
00:27:02,052 --> 00:27:03,052
[Rike] No more!

318
00:27:03,076 --> 00:27:04,876
[Balthasar] No more Küblböck! Thats right!

319
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
[???]

320
00:27:16,524 --> 00:27:18,524
[Mean bullies] Look, what is he doing here?

321
00:27:22,248 --> 00:27:24,748
How d-d-did you m-m-anege to become famous?!

322

324
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
[Daniel] Such piggy-asses!

325
00:27:34,544 --> 00:27:36,544
[Father] Just ignore...

326
00:27:36,868 --> 00:27:38,868
We have to talk!

327
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:42,992
Hollywood called, they wanna do a screentest

328
00:27:43,016 --> 00:27:45,016
[Daniel] For real? (acting surprised)

329
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
[Father] Also Las Vegas is interested.

330
00:27:47,064 --> 00:27:49,064
[Daniel] Las Vegas, for real?

331
00:27:49,788 --> 00:27:51,788
[Father] yeah, they wanna invite us.

332
00:27:51,812 --> 00:27:54,812
But I don't think Hollxwood is bad. [??????]

333
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:17,236
[Have fun with the english parts]

334
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,260
[Woman] And what are you doing here?

335
00:28:30,784 --> 00:28:32,784
[Daniel] A screentest.

336
00:28:32,808 --> 00:28:34,808
[Woman] Screentest for what?

337
00:28:34,832 --> 00:28:36,832
[Daniel] For... Hollywood! :-)

338
00:28:36,856 --> 00:28:38,856
What about you?

339
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
[Woman] I am Marie.

340
00:28:41,604 --> 00:28:43,404
Aren't you afraid?

341
00:28:43,428 --> 00:28:45,428
[Daniel] Afraid of what?

342
00:28:45,452 --> 00:28:47,452
[Marie] That I'm chasing you.

343
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,476
That I wanna kill you.

344
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,100
[Daniel] Did I do anything to you?

345
00:28:51,124 --> 00:28:53,124
[Marie] No! The opposite!

346
00:28:53,548 --> 00:28:55,548
You saved my fathers life!

347
00:28:56,572 --> 00:28:58,572
[Daniel] For real?!

348
00:28:58,596 --> 00:29:00,996
[Marie] He nearly drowned in Steinberger See!

349
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,020
But then you appeared to him as an angel

350
00:29:03,044 --> 00:29:05,044
[Daniel] Hm!

351
00:29:05,168 --> 00:29:07,168
[Marie] Lots of people like you...

352
00:29:07,192 --> 00:29:09,192
...though they don't know you.

353
00:29:13,016 --> 00:29:15,216
[Balthasar] Don't get intimidated, Rike!

354
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,640
You shall stalk him...

355
00:29:18,664 --> 00:29:20,664
...without attracting attention.

356
00:29:23,688 --> 00:29:25,688
We always have to pretend...

357
00:29:25,712 --> 00:29:27,712
...to be die-hard fans of him.

358
00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:30,336
Until he is in our trap!

359
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,260
Til he is ours...! Ours alone!

360
00:30:04,284 --> 00:30:06,284
And don't you forget, Rike...

361
00:30:06,308 --> 00:30:09,508
...Küblböck is nothing more,
than a laughable one-hit-wonder.

362
00:30:10,632 --> 00:30:12,632
A crazy scarecrow!

363

And we!
We are the true superstars

Never!

365
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:55,904
[Marie] Bullshit!
Don't let them tell you what to do.

366
00:30:55,928 --> 00:30:57,428
Such bullshit!

367
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,352
[Marie] Danny-boy? What is your deal?

368
00:31:02,376 --> 00:31:04,376
He is Daniel KÜblböck, OK?

369
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
[Daniel] I'm not Indiana Jones...

370
00:31:11,124 --> 00:31:13,124
[Marie] Well, I wouldn't participate, Daniel.

371
00:31:13,148 --> 00:31:14,948
You have to remain true to yourself.

372
00:31:14,972 --> 00:31:17,172
Only then you can be succesful in Hollywood.

373
00:31:50,896 --> 00:31:57,896
From Eggenfelden... to... Hollywood

374
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,420
[Balthasar] Hm, Hollywood!

...but right now... i would love to...

379
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,240
...make you a cockroach!

380
00:32:49,264 --> 00:32:51,064
[Balthasar] Then do it!

381
00:32:51,088 --> 00:32:53,088
Show me, what you are able to do!

382
00:32:53,112 --> 00:32:55,612
In the end,
are you just another ridiculous phony?

383
00:32:55,636 --> 00:32:57,636
I thought you were a one-armed-monster!

384
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,260
Johnny! What did you do?!

385
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:05,984
Undo it!

386
00:33:06,008 --> 00:33:08,008
[Johnny] What does a good boy say?

387
00:33:08,032 --> 00:33:10,632
[Balthasar] I wanna be human,
not a cockroach!

388
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,656
I wanna be human, like you!

389
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,980
[Johnny] Bullshit, I'm not human!

390
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:16,304
I'm a ghost.

391
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,528
[Balthasar] Come on, help me!

392
00:33:17,552 --> 00:33:19,552

[Petra] I don't care!

402
00:33:43,892 --> 00:33:49,292
[Grandpa Winter] You don't care, but I do!
It's a catastrophe, if my costumers run away!

403
00:33:49,316 --> 00:33:51,316
What should I do?

404

or like rock-music?

Well, if you say so...

[Johnny] But I was there all the time.
Didn't you feel it?

444
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:30,069
[Daniel] Somehting must have gone wrong.
Why is everybody hating me?

445

[Johnny] I think you are doing your
many fans injustice, Daniel.

446

They are all very proud of you

447

my exam yet?!

[Tom] Well, it will be enough.

528
00:50:32,285 --> 00:50:37,785
I shoot...
and you record.

529
00:50:37,809 --> 00:50:39,809
[Rike] Ok, no problem!

530
00:50:43,233 --> 00:50:46,633
Dot it, Tommy!
Or should I do it?

531
00:50:46,657 --> 00:50:48,657
[Tom] Ok, if you insist!

532
00:50:48,881 --> 00:50:52,081
I'm better with the camera anyway.
- Coward!

533
00:50:52,605 --> 00:50:56,005
[Tom] Don't be silly, Rike!
[Rike] Loser.

534
00:50:56,029 --> 00:51:00,729
[Tom] Come on, don't put on a show!
What is happening?

535
00:51:01,453 --> 00:51:03,753
You aren't able to stay cool, typical.

536
00:51:03,777 --> 00:51:07,177
[Rike] Tell me Tommy, what are you doing?
What are you fingering around?

537
00:51:08,701 --> 00:51:11,701
[Tom] Something is wrong with the camera.
Did you break it?

538
00:51:15,725 --> 00:51:19,325
[Daniel] At my home all hell always broke lose

539
00:51:21,549 --> 00:51:27,449
My mother was drinking.
And I was always taken for a fool.

540
00:51:29,273 --> 00:51:31,673
And my brother was a Neo-Nazi!
- Shit!

541
00:51:31,897 --> 00:51:35,197
[Tom] In my case it was my stepfather,
who always beat me.

542
00:51:35,221 --> 00:51:37,221
Day and night.

543
00:51:37,245 --> 00:51:40,745
But one day I punched back, it felt great.
It was so much fun!

544
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:43,169
[Rike] Here, it's workign again.

545
00:51:43,293 --> 00:51:47,793
[Daniel] I learned one thing in my life.
To NOT punch back.

546
00:51:47,817 --> 00:51:50,317
[Rike] Turn around at last, Küblböck!

547
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:52,641
[Tom] So, camera is running.

548
00:51:52,665 --> 00:51:57,165
It's your turn, Miss Regisseuse.
[Wordplay on Regisseur(director) and the female ending -seuse]

549
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,789
[Rike] The gun is jamming.
Do you wanna try?

550
00:51:59,813 --> 00:52:03,313
[Tom] I'm filming right now!
You do it. Just pull the trigger.

551
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:04,537
:-P

552
00:52:07,561 --> 00:52:11,561
I had a guitar once...
an old and broken one.

553
00:52:11,585 --> 00:52:17,585
And they stole it.
I didn't have money to buy one again.

554
00:52:17,609 --> 00:52:19,609
But I would love to play.

555
00:52:21,533 --> 00:52:24,033
[Daniel] I could imagine...

556
00:52:24,257 --> 00:52:29,157
...that you could also dance and sing...
If you wanted to.

557
00:52:29,181 --> 00:52:32,781
[Rike] Gosh, am I crazy?
Did you lose your mind, or what is happening?

558
00:52:32,805 --> 00:52:37,805
[Tom] Maybe it's not so bad...
Maybe we should give him one last chance

559
00:52:38,229 --> 00:52:43,229
[Rike] Okay... You know what?
You can do this on your own!

560
00:52:43,253 --> 00:52:45,253
Including all the consequences, okay?

561
00:52:45,277 --> 00:52:47,977
I'm going home,
making myself a nice evening.

562
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:50,401
How about this?
-Not bad!

563
00:52:50,425 --> 00:52:52,425
I didn't ask you for an answer,
Daniel Küblböck.

564
00:52:53,149 --> 00:52:56,449
[Tom] I'm okay with this.
[Rike] Good, that's how we do it, then.

565
00:52:56,473 --> 00:53:02,073
[Rike] And if you kill him, all glory to you.
All alone. Is it fair?

566
00:53:02,697 --> 00:53:05,197
[Daniel] Yeah, that's fair.
[Rike] Shut up!

567
00:53:05,721 --> 00:53:09,821
[Tom] I'll call you later.
[Rike] What's on TV tonight?

568
00:53:09,845 --> 00:53:14,845
<i>Deutschland Sucht Den Superstar</i>
[Germanys version of <i>Americas Idol</i>.
Daniel became famous in it]

569
00:53:14,869 --> 00:53:16,869
[Rike] Very funny, Daniel, really.

570
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:18,893
[Tom] Yeah, uhm...
I'm gonna call you later, then

571
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:20,417
:-P

572
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:41,641
By the way, I liked that one song
by you quite a bit.

573
00:53:41,665 --> 00:53:43,665
The new one.

574
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:47,789
Such a damn bullshit!

575
00:53:48,313 --> 00:53:51,013
Now I'm stuck in this shit.

576
00:53:56,737 --> 00:54:00,937
[Daniel] How about a deal?
[Tom] A deal?

577
00:54:01,461 --> 00:54:10,961
You let me go... I'll leave...
And will tell no one where I've been.

578
00:54:10,985 --> 00:54:15,885
[Tom] I don't believe you!
[Daniel] Then you have to kill me...

579
00:54:15,909 --> 00:54:17,909
... or run away yourself.

580
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:29,233
[Tom] Things are, how they are.

581
00:54:31,757 --> 00:54:33,757
All shit.

582
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:37,981
And I am the biggest asshole.

583
00:54:40,205 --> 00:54:42,905
I will never achieve something big.

584
00:54:42,929 --> 00:54:46,429
My stepfather always said so,
and he was right.

585
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:50,253
I should have never been born
into this shit world. Never!

586
00:54:52,377 --> 00:54:54,677
[Daniel] Just cry, if you want to.

587
00:54:54,701 --> 00:54:56,901
Boys are allowed to cry.

588
00:55:00,025 --> 00:55:03,025
[Tom] Then please,
get otut of here

589
00:56:28,749 --> 00:56:30,549
Impossible!

590
00:56:30,573 --> 00:56:34,573
[Father] Daniel! Are you crazy?
Where have you been the whole time?

591
00:56:36,897 --> 00:56:39,197
My god, where have you been?

592
00:56:39,221 --> 00:56:41,221
[???]... can't explain.

593
00:58:49,245 --> 00:58:52,245
[All concert footage is real, by the way]

594
01:00:16,269 --> 01:00:18,269
[Petra] <i>Dear Daniel,</i>

595
01:00:19,193 --> 01:00:22,193
<i>Your concert in Passau was wonderful.</i>

596
01:00:23,117 --> 01:00:25,817
<i>My Grandpa is a big fan of you now, too.</i>

597
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:29,041
<i>And sometimes acts like a teenager again.</i>

598
01:00:29,565 --> 01:00:32,065
<i>Thousand times thank you
for the invitation.</i>

599
01:00:32,089 --> 01:00:34,089
Yours truly,
Petra

600
01:00:34,513 --> 01:00:36,913
Positive energy!

601
01:00:38,537 --> 01:00:43,337
[Winter] Yeah yeah yeah... positive energy.
Well you gotta sleep now.

602
01:00:43,461 --> 01:00:46,961
Positive energy isn't bad,
better than negative energy, heh?

603
01:00:47,085 --> 01:00:49,585
Sleep well, you have school tomorrow.

604
01:00:49,609 --> 01:00:52,609
And eh... yeah, 
you need positive energy then, heh?

605
01:00:52,633 --> 01:00:55,733
Sooooo, sleep well then.
-Good night.
-Good night!

606
01:01:12,457 --> 01:01:15,157
[Daniel] And... 
where is my christmas present?

607
01:01:15,481 --> 01:01:18,481
[Johnny] Since when do you 
just think about yourself?

608
01:01:18,805 --> 01:01:22,805
[Daniel] I don't get it.
Didn't I do everything right?

609
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:25,329
Haven't I passed my exam?

610
01:01:25,553 --> 01:01:30,453
[Johnny] You forgot something.
Something very important.

611
01:01:31,877 --> 01:01:37,077
[Daniel] What?
[Johnny] Tom and Rike!

612
01:01:39,801 --> 01:01:42,801
They haven't receiced 
a Christmas gif from you.

613
01:01:43,025 --> 01:01:45,525
[Daniel] A gift from me for them?!

614
01:01:46,449 --> 01:01:52,449
[Johnny] I want you to give them something...
that you like very much.

615
01:01:52,873 --> 01:01:55,873
[Daniel] They wanted to kill me!
[Johnny] Oh yeah, well...

616
01:01:56,897 --> 01:01:59,397
That's a long time ago.

617
01:01:59,421 --> 01:02:01,921
But now you are friends.

618
01:02:03,645 --> 01:02:06,745
[Daniel] I don't know...
you can't really call us friends...

619
01:02:06,769 --> 01:02:09,369
I think you are going a bit far with this!

620
01:02:11,593 --> 01:02:13,593
[Johnny] Not at all!

621
01:02:13,917 --> 01:02:14,117
*sqeak*

622
01:02:16,241 --> 01:02:19,241
You will give them your guitar,
got it?

623
01:02:19,965 --> 01:02:23,965
[Daniel] What?!
My guitar? Never!

624
01:02:25,289 --> 01:02:31,289
[Johnny] Well. Then you are just an
itsy-bitsy tiny wizard apprentice.

625
01:02:32,913 --> 01:02:36,213
[Daniel] Come on... 
I beg you.

626
01:02:36,237 --> 01:02:40,237
[Johnny] A wizard often gives that away,
that he loves most.

627
01:02:41,861 --> 01:02:46,361
And you wanna become a wizard...
a real, big wizard. Right?

628
01:03:26,985 --> 01:03:29,185
I got something for you!

629
01:03:50,209 --> 01:03:51,209
[BEST SCENE EVER]

630
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:39,833
[Balth.] That was dirty little trick 
of you, Johnny!

631
01:05:40,257 --> 01:05:44,757
And that thing with your arm!
Sometimes you got, sometimes not!

632
01:05:44,781 --> 01:05:48,081
Is that just one more dirty spell,
or is it a prothesis?

633
01:05:50,105 --> 01:05:53,505
[Johnny] You can pick your answer,
whatever you want it to be.

634
01:05:53,529 --> 01:05:58,729
[Balth.] Ok then. Maybe i lost the battle.
But the war isn't over yet!

635
01:05:59,653 --> 01:06:02,653
I'm betting on it!
[Johnny] I wouldn't be so sure about that.

636
01:06:03,577 --> 01:06:07,577
[Balth] You must give him your magic-wand, 
don't you?

637
01:06:08,001 --> 01:06:11,001
[Johnny] Why do you ask?
[Balth.] :-D

638
01:06:12,425 --> 01:06:16,425
Then you will lose your magic power.
Three times cockroach [???]

639
01:06:18,149 --> 01:06:20,149
I know magic well enough for this.

640
01:06:20,173 --> 01:06:25,173
In the corner. Broom broom it has been.
My little Johnny. Then we get rid of you.
[???]

641
01:06:25,297 --> 01:06:30,297
And can the little wizard even handle
his new magic powers?

642
01:06:34,921 --> 01:06:37,221
I doubt it a little.

643
01:06:48,845 --> 01:06:52,845
[Father] What's that?
[Grandma] That's something very special!

644
01:06:53,669 --> 01:06:55,969
[Father] Isn't there a letter with it?

645
01:06:55,993 --> 01:07:00,193
[Daniel] ...from the one-armed.
[Grandma] One-armed?

646
01:07:03,617 --> 01:07:05,617
I only know one one-armed.

647
01:07:06,341 --> 01:07:09,741
It was Grandpa! My husband.
- Exactly!

648
01:07:11,165 --> 01:07:17,165
We first met on Oktoberfest 1965.
I was 16!

649
01:07:19,189 --> 01:07:23,489
He sometimes came to my tent,
where i worked as a waitress.

650
01:07:24,613 --> 01:07:29,113
So I fed him, he couldn't 
do it himself, with one arm only.

651
01:07:30,137 --> 01:07:33,537
And... yeah... well...
I fell in love with him.

652
01:07:34,961 --> 01:07:37,961
[Daniel] And what does he look like, 
Granny?

653
01:07:39,185 --> 01:07:42,185
[Grand.] Well, real dark hair, 
just like you.

654
01:07:42,209 --> 01:07:44,709
And brown eyes.

655
01:07:45,033 --> 01:07:47,933
Have I never shown you the pictures?

656
01:07:48,957 --> 01:07:51,957
Well, probably because
 I still miss him.

657
01:07:52,481 --> 01:07:55,681
I didn't have the heart to show you.

658
01:08:00,905 --> 01:08:03,505
Look. That's him!

659
01:08:07,929 --> 01:08:09,929
Do you like him?

660
01:08:13,553 --> 01:08:16,653
[Daniel] What did you say,
where is he now?

661
01:08:16,677 --> 01:08:21,677
[Grand.] Dead. For along time.
Somewhere in heaven.

662
01:08:27,201 --> 01:08:31,401
[Daniel] In Heaven?
[Grand.] Yeah, in heaven.

663
01:08:38,325 --> 01:08:40,525
[Daniel] Incredible!

664
01:08:41,249 --> 01:08:44,249
[Grand.] So sad you didn't 
get to know each other

665
01:08:46,473 --> 01:08:48,973
[Daniel] Granny, please don't cry.

666
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:57,897
[Grand.] You would have so much fun, 
you two!

667
01:08:59,721 --> 01:09:02,121
Well... that's life!

668
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:12,545
Tell me, do you believe in 
miracles... magic?

669
01:09:16,469 --> 01:09:18,469
[Daniel] Im not sure

670
01:09:21,293 --> 01:09:26,793
[Grand.] What did he look like?
Did he wear a dress-coat and a hat?

671
01:09:28,817 --> 01:09:31,317
And white gloves?

672
01:09:32,341 --> 01:09:34,341
[Daniel] Yes, Granny!

673
01:09:34,365 --> 01:09:38,165
[Grand.] And did he have s silvern 
metal-instrument with him?

674
01:09:39,489 --> 01:09:41,489
[Daniel] Yes, exactly.

675
01:09:45,513 --> 01:09:48,513
Grand.] Then tell him 
greetings from me, next time.

676
01:09:50,037 --> 01:09:54,537
Tell him I love him. 
And I was always loyal.

677
01:09:56,961 --> 01:10:00,461
And now go up and sleep.
And seet dreams!

678
01:10:01,085 --> 01:10:07,085
And with the magic-wand...
It's important...

679
01:10:07,109 --> 01:10:11,809
... you must only
 use it to help others.

680
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,833
But I'm sure he already told you, eh?

681
01:10:15,557 --> 01:10:17,557
You... WIIIIIZAAARD!

682
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:21,481
[Daniel] I will do it, Granny.

683
01:10:22,305 --> 01:10:25,305
[Grand.] This stays a secret, ok?

684
01:10:25,729 --> 01:10:27,729
[Daniel] Deal.

685
01:11:22,153 --> 01:11:24,653
[Reporter] We are standing in Cannes, 
Ladies and Gentleman.

686
01:11:24,677 --> 01:11:26,677
In front of the festival palace, 
as you can see.

687
01:11:26,701 --> 01:11:32,201
And here will be premiered 
the movie of Daniel Küblböck.

688
01:11:33,225 --> 01:11:35,625
It's worldwide premiere.

689
01:11:35,649 --> 01:11:37,649
