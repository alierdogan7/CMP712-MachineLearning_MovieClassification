1
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:52,675
The National Rifle Association
has produced a film

2
00:00:52,818 --> 00:00:55,378
which you are sure
to find of great interest.

3
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:57,921
Let's look at it.

4
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:01,584
- It was the morning
of April 20th, 1999.

5
00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:05,390
And it was pretty much like
any other morning in America.

6
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:10,093
The farmer did his chores,

7
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,932
the milkman
made his deliveries,

8
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:15,233
the president bombed
another country

9
00:01:15,374 --> 00:01:17,239
whose name
we couldn't pronounce.

10
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:18,900
Out in Fargo, North Dakota,

11
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:22,606
Carry McWilliams
went on his morning walk.

12
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:25,546
Back in Michigan, Mrs. Hughes
welcomed her students

13
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,812
for another day of school.

14
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:30,650
And out in a little town
in Colorado,

15
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,155
two boys went bowling

16
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,759
at six in the morning.

17
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,362
Yes, it was a typical day
in the United States

18
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:39,464
of America.

19
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:43,863
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yeah,

20
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:46,864
I'm here to open up an account.

21
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,769
- Okay, what type of account
would you like?

22
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:52,105
- Um, I want the account where
I can, uh, get the free gun.

23
00:01:52,244 --> 00:01:53,609
- Okay.

24
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,112
- I'd spotted an ad
in the local Michigan paper

25
00:01:56,248 --> 00:01:58,773
that said if you opened an
account at North Country Bank,

26
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01,284
the bank would give you a gun.
- You do a CD

27
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,354
and we'll hand you a gun.

28
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:07,220
We have a whole brochure here
that you can look at.

29
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,191
Once we do the background check
and everything,

30
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:11,888
it's yours to go.
- Okay. Well, all right,

31
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:13,999
well, that's the account
I'd like to open.

32
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:17,296
We have a vault, which
at all times we keep at least

33
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:18,903
500 firearms.
- Five-hundred of these,

34
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,733
you have in your vault?
- In our vault.

35
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:22,238
- Wow.

36
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,740
- We have to do
a background check.

37
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:25,741
- At the bank here?
- At the bank,

38
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:27,743
which we are a licensed
firearm dealer.

39
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,348
- Oh, you are? You're a bank
and a licensed firearm dealer.

40
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,145
What do I put for "race"?
White or Caucasian or...?

41
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:35,082
- Caucasian.
- Caucasian.

42
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:40,090
- I knew you were gonna make me
spell the... Cau-ca-sian.

43
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:42,751
Is that right?
- Yes.

44
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:46,991
I don't think that's the part
they're gonna be worried about.

45
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,101
"Have you ever been adjudicated
mentally defective

46
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,567
or have you ever been committed
to a mental institution?"

47
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,535
I've never been committed
to a mental institution.

48
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,038
What does that mean,

49
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,438
"Have I ever been adjudicated
mentally defective"?

50
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:59,942
- It would be something
involved with a crime.

51
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,445
So if I'm just normally mentally
defective but not criminal...

52
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:03,946
- Yeah, exactly.

53
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,382
- There you go, Mike.
- Okay. Thank you very much. Wow.

54
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,886
- I had one personally--
- That's a nice tension.

55
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:12,081
- It is and it's
a straight-shooter,

56
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:13,714
let me tell ya.

57
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:18,626
- Wow. Sweet.

58
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:21,062
Well, here's my first question:
You think

59
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,395
it's a little dangerous,
handing out guns in a bank?

60
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,976
- Ten-ho!

61
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,917
- Each gun makes lots
of battle sounds.

62
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:19,252
Just press the trigger,
and listen.

63
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:21,154
- That sounds like a gun battle.
Over there.

64
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:23,761
- Is it real?
- Looks like real!

65
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,524
Hey, it sounds like real!

66
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:30,032
- Right! The Sound-O-Power
military and western rifles

67
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,534
by Marx!

68
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,662
- This was my first gun.

69
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:38,675
I couldn't wait to go outside
and shoot up the neighbourhood.

70
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,302
Those were the days.
"I was born

71
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,847
"in Michigan

72
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,781
"and I wish and wish again
that I was back

73
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,649
"in the town where I was born"

74
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,552
- By the time I was a teenager,

75
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,055
I was such a good shot

76
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,387
I won the National
Rifle Association's

77
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,962
Markman award.
You see,

78
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,462
I grew up in Michigan,

79
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:01,293
a gun-lover's paradise.

80
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:03,367
And so did this man,

81
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:06,027
the Oscar-winning actor
and president

82
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,868
of the National
Rifle Association,

83
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,703
Mr. Charlton Heston.

84
00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:16,209
We come from a state
where everyone

85
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:18,908
loves to go hunting.

86
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:20,541
- Hah.
- Even the dogs.

87
00:05:20,686 --> 00:05:24,144
- There were actually
two of the hunters at camp.

88
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,655
They thought
they'd get a few pictures

89
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,725
of the dog dressed up
as a hunter

90
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,987
to kind of just have some fun
around camp.

91
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,154
And one of the guys
had the idea that,

92
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,562
"Why don't we sling a rifle
on the dog's back

93
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,828
to make the pictures
a little more interesting.

94
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,530
The victim was kneeling down
in front of the dog

95
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,641
when the weapon slipped.

96
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,903
The one round went through
the victim's shin,

97
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,410
the right part of his shin,

98
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:49,605
and came out through
the back of his calf.

99
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:53,240
- Was the dog hauled off for any
period of time by the police?

100
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:55,080
- No, it wasn't. No.

101
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:59,089
Um, in Michigan,
the law basically states

102
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,420
that people can commit crimes
that animals

103
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,688
aren't some... form of,
uh, you know,

104
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,195
whatever that can
commit a crime.

105
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,697
- An animal cannot commit a crime

106
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,926
or be charged with a crime
in this state.

107
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,469
- Exactly.
- Is it possible that the dog

108
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:15,540
knew what it was doing?
- That, I don't know.

109
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:17,767
I really wouldn't be able
to tell you that.

110
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,037
The dog was cute
dressed up as a hunter,

111
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,613
there's no doubt about it.
I mean, it was a funny picture,

112
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,875
um, you know, to look at.

113
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,985
It was... it was kind of neat.

114
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:31,721
- Yup, this was the kind
of place I was from.

115
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:33,324
A box

116
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,427
of 270s.
- Coming up.

117
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,729
There you go.
- Perfect.

118
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:45,569
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

119
00:06:45,704 --> 00:06:47,228
Sorry about that, sorry.

120
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:48,670
- So I've been discharged.

121
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:50,799
- You don't need no gun control.
You know what you need?

122
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,411
We need some bullet control.

123
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:58,414
We need to control the bullets,
that's right.

124
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,042
I think all bullets
should cost $5,000.

125
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:04,747
$5,000 for a bullet.
You know why?

126
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,256
'Cause if a bullet cost $5,000,

127
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,691
there'd be no more
innocent bystanders.

128
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:11,693
[ clapping and cheering ]

129
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,457
Every time

130
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,998
somebody get shot, people are,

131
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,432
"Damn, he must've
did something."

132
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:20,561
See, they put $50,000's worth
of bullets in his ass!"

133
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:27,037
And people'd think
before they killed somebody

134
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:29,044
for a bullet that cost $5,000!

135
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:31,308
"Man, I would blow
your fucking head off --

136
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,418
if I could afford it."

137
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,884
I'm gonna get me another job,

138
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:42,721
I'm gonna start saving some
money, and you a dead man.

139
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:46,797
You better hope I can't
get no bullets on layaway.

140
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,763
- Not far from where
Charlton Heston and I grew up

141
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:55,136
is a training ground
for the Michigan Militia.

142
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,639
Why do you use the bowling pins?

143
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:59,903
- From a self-defence or
whatever tactical standpoint,

144
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:01,740
it's a small target,
which also represents

145
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,906
the vitals on a...
on a human being,

146
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,517
if you ever had to shoot at one.

147
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:12,382
- The Michigan Militia
became known around the world

148
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:16,551
when, on April 19th, 1995,
two guys living in Michigan

149
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:18,356
who had attended
Militia meetings,

150
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:19,930
Timothy McVeigh
and Terry Nichols,

151
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:21,862
blew up the federal building

152
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,731
in Oklahoma City,

153
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,202
killing 168 people.

154
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:29,364
The Michigan Militia
wanted everyone to know

155
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:32,875
that they were nothing
like McVeigh and Nichols.

156
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,377
- This is an American tradition.

157
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:37,038
It's an American responsibility
to be armed.

158
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:39,548
If you're not armed,
you're not responsible.

159
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,051
Who's gonna defend your kids,
the cops?

160
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:45,384
The federal government?
No, none of them.

161
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:48,049
It's your job
to defend you and yours.

162
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:50,855
If you don't do it,
you're in dereliction of duty,

163
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:53,226
as an American. Period.

164
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:55,424
- We're here to let them
know we're here to help.

165
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,398
We're not the bogeymen
we're made out to be.

166
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,868
We're here to help and defend
the people of this country.

167
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:02,064
- I'm sure you guys
are the kind of people

168
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,232
that people would like
to have as their neighbour.

169
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:06,401
If somebody's in need,
you're there to help them.

170
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:08,911
- Pretty much. We're all normal
people. We all have regular jobs

171
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,175
and this is what we do
on our time.

172
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:13,910
- What kind of a job do you have?
- I'm a draftsman.

173
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,146
- How about you?
- Unemployed right now.

174
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:18,085
- Frank, what do you do
for a living?

175
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:19,588
- I work for
a heat trading company.

176
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,920
I drive a truck for 'em.
- Okay. How about you?

177
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:26,589
- I'm a real-estate negotiator
- Real-estate negotiator!

178
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,757
- White collar all the way.

179
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,926
- You don't bring that with you,
though, do you,

180
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,435
when you're negotiating
the real estate?

181
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:34,163
- No.

182
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:35,671
- Where do you live,
in suburban--

183
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,173
- Westland.
- So what do you have

184
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:39,607
in your home?
- Smith & Wesson 9-millimetre.

185
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,144
- Nine-millimetre?
- Yeah.

186
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,645
- And how about you?
- With hollow points.

187
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:44,146
- Twelve gage.

188
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,648
- Twelve gage at home?
- Yeah.

189
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:47,149
- How about you?
- M-16.

190
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,651
- At home?
- Yeah.

191
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:50,345
At the ready.
- I don't agree with that,

192
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,684
'cause you gotta worry about
where your arms are going.

193
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:56,693
- I know where they're gonna go
when I aim and shoot.

194
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,093
- Whose idea was the calendar?

195
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,098
- That'd probably be Christian.

196
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,101
- A picture's worth 1,000 words.
A) it demonstrates a level

197
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,569
of sophistication that you
wouldn't expect out of Militia;

198
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:10,334
B) you know,

199
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,603
we're people too.
- Right.

200
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:14,769
- And we have a lot of fun
with it.

201
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:16,278
- Right.
- There was a fundraiser.

202
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:19,316
It showed, um, that we're not
so serious, you know.

203
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:21,919
We're not these conspiracy nuts
who wouldn't want our pictures

204
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:26,047
to get out. The idea...
it was a fundraiser, you know...

205
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:29,524
- I've had guns, um...

206
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:31,891
pretty much since
I was old enough to...

207
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:36,694
to have them. And I learned
how to use them, um...

208
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:38,427
You're silly!

209
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,539
Uh, because being a female,
number one,

210
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:44,073
I felt it was important
to be able to protect myself

211
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:45,801
with the best means possible.

212
00:10:45,944 --> 00:10:48,071
And one of those means
is having a gun.

213
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:49,976
When a criminal
breaks into your house,

214
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:51,878
who's the first person
you're gonna call?

215
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:55,953
Most people will call the police
because they have guns.

216
00:10:56,088 --> 00:11:00,616
Cut out the middleman. Take care
of your own family yourself.

217
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:05,219
If you're not going to protect
your family, who is?

218
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,662
- We're not racist,
we're not extremist,

219
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:10,893
we're not fundamentalist, we're
not terrorists or militants

220
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:13,561
or other such nonsense.
- We're citizens.

221
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:17,106
- We're just concerned citizens.
We have a desire

222
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:19,176
to fulfil our responsibilities
and duties as Americans,

223
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:22,109
and armed citizenry
is part of that.

224
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:30,846
- What do you grow here?
- Right now, there's tofu beans,

225
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,223
soy beans. Tofu-soy beans.

226
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,420
- You're a tofu farmer.
- Yeah. Yeah, food farmer.

227
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,054
I'm a food farmer.
- Food.

228
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,793
- I grow food for people to eat.

229
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,768
No herbicides, no pesticides
on that stuff.

230
00:11:45,904 --> 00:11:48,134
- Right. All natural.
- Right.

231
00:11:48,273 --> 00:11:50,503
- Yeah. Better.
- Certified organic.

232
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:52,303
- Uh-huh. Healthier.
- Yeah.

233
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:53,809
Basically, yeah.

234
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:57,438
This is James Nichols,
the brother of Terry Nichols.

235
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,609
James graduated from high
school the same year I did,

236
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:02,151
in the district next to mine.

237
00:12:02,287 --> 00:12:04,755
On this farm
in Decker, Michigan,

238
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,324
McVeigh and the Nichols
brothers made practice bombs

239
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:10,292
before Oklahoma City.

240
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,556
Terry and James were both
arrested in connection

241
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,723
to the bombing.
[ TV news ]: U.S. attorneys

242
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:17,460
formally linked the Nichols
brothers of Michigan

243
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,503
with Oklahoma bomb suspect
Timothy McVeigh.

244
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,401
Officials charged James,
who was at the hearing,

245
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,236
and Terry, who was not,
with conspiring

246
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,901
to make and possess
small bombs.

247
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:30,071
- Terry Nichols was convicted
and received a life sentence.

248
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:33,981
Timothy McVeigh was executed.
But the feds

249
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,950
didn't have the goods on James,

250
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,057
so the charges were dropped.
- I'm just glad

251
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,092
to be out and free,
so I can get on with my life.

252
00:12:42,227 --> 00:12:43,592
- Did Timothy McVeigh
ever stay here?

253
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,755
- Yes. Yes. He stayed here
several times.

254
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:49,628
For the longest period, about
three months or so, I dunno.

255
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,258
But, uh, he was a nice guy.

256
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,166
- Decent guy?
- Oh, yeah.

257
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,670
- They didn't find anything
on this farm.

258
00:12:54,806 --> 00:12:56,171
- As to what,

259
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,173
bomb-making material?
- Any kind of explosives.

260
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,768
- Uh, yeah, I had blasting caps,
dynamite blasting caps,

261
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:04,108
dynamite fuse, black powder,
you know?

262
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:06,444
For muzzle loaders and...
Sure.

263
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:10,077
Diesel fuel, fertilizer, but,
uh, that is normal farm stuff

264
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:13,453
that is no way connected
any way whatsoever to, uh,

265
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:16,026
the Oklahoma City bombing
or bomb making.

266
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:19,722
Them people - law enforcement,
if you wanna call 'em that -

267
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:23,062
were here and they were shaking
in their shoes.

268
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:26,398
They were physically shaking.
Scared to death.

269
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:27,903
- Of?

270
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,565
- Because they thought this
was gonna be another Waco.

271
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,076
Because certain people...

272
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:37,045
namely my ex-wife
and other people,

273
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:40,242
said I'm a radical,
I'm a wild man,

274
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:43,912
I got a gun under every arm,
down every leg and every shoe,

275
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,421
every corner of the house.

276
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:48,390
You say anything to me,
I'll shoot ya.

277
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,553
If the people find out how
they've been ripped off

278
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:56,760
and... and enslaved in this
country by the government,

279
00:13:56,902 --> 00:14:01,601
by the powers-to-be...

280
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,938
they will revolt, with anger,

281
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,273
with merciless anger.

282
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:10,404
There'll be blood
running in the streets.

283
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,312
When a government
turns tyrannical,

284
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,579
it is your duty to overthrow it.

285
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,086
- Well, why not use Gandhi's way?

286
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:18,712
He didn't have any guns,

287
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,654
and he beat the British empire.

288
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:23,260
- I'm not familiar with that.

289
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,158
- Oscoda has a bad habit
of raising psychos.

290
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:30,632
Bad habit of it.

291
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,259
- This is Brent.

292
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,066
And this is his buddy DJ.

293
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,902
They live in Oscoda, Michigan,

294
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,907
across the bay
from the Nichols farm.

295
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,409
Eric Harris,

296
00:14:40,545 --> 00:14:42,410
who would later go on
to commit the massacre

297
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:44,412
at Columbine High School
in Colorado,

298
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:45,914
spent part
of his childhood here.

299
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:50,715
Eric lived on
the air-force base in Oscoda,

300
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:54,121
where his dad flew planes
during the Gulf War.

301
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,921
Twenty percent of all the bombs
dropped in that war

302
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,122
were from planes
that took off from Oscoda.

303
00:15:00,265 --> 00:15:03,428
I asked Brent if he remembered
anything about Eric.

304
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:05,593
- I never knew him,
but I knew of him.

305
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:08,433
He left here before I got here.
I've only lived here seven years

306
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:10,541
off and on.
- He was about the same age

307
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:12,870
as you, so you must have people
in your class--

308
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:15,673
- A friend of mine knows him,
he was in class with him.

309
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,611
He's lived here all his life.

310
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:20,377
- I went to school with him
and it shocked me to hear it

311
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,043
on the news.

312
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:26,283
That especially a kid from here
would be doing that.

313
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,222
- I didn't last too long
in high school.

314
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,725
I got kicked out,
I got expelled.

315
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:32,227
- Why was that?
- I had a run-in with a kid

316
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:35,731
one time and I pulled a weapon
on him, I pulled a gun on him.

317
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:37,357
- What kind of gun?
- Nine-millimetre.

318
00:15:37,502 --> 00:15:39,697
I could've made a mess
out of that situation.

319
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,738
- Could've been worse.
- Could've been a lot worse.

320
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:43,534
- Could've been Eric Harris.
- It could've been.

321
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:45,939
- So they kicked you out?
- Yeah, they kicked me out

322
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:50,207
for 380 days or 165 days,
whatever a full school year is.

323
00:15:50,348 --> 00:15:53,715
- For the longest time, that's
what my plan was, to move out

324
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,945
to Colorado.
- Colorado?

325
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:58,487
- 'Cause I've got family
out there.

326
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:00,818
Matter of fact,
one of my uncles is a janitor

327
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,324
for Columbine School.

328
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,826
- Really?
- Yeah.

329
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:06,396
- After Columbine,
what was it like here in Oscoda?

330
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:08,556
- My name was second-highest
on the bomb list,

331
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,692
because of the reputation
you get in this town.

332
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,362
- Why? You mean
they did a list of--

333
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,531
- Of suspects.
- Of students who potentially--

334
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,199
- Yeah.
- ...would call in a bomb threat

335
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:19,708
after Columbine?
- Yes.

336
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,710
- And you were number two
on the list?

337
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,042
- I was second or third
on the list, yeah.

338
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:27,709
- Why is that?
- Because the whole fact is,

339
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,378
like I said, this town
really gets people down.

340
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,888
- Yeah, but why
did they single you out?

341
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:37,051
- Because I was a troubled kid.
- You were in trouble in school?

342
00:16:37,195 --> 00:16:39,095
- Oh, yeah.
Why did they put you

343
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,722
number two on their list,
after Columbine,

344
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:45,564
of the students
that could be a threat?

345
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,537
Come on, there must be a reason.
- Well, okay. The thing is,

346
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:51,073
I have a thing, it's called
the "Anarchist Cookbook."

347
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:53,939
It shows you how to make bombs
and stuff like that.

348
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,876
If there's anything
that went wrong,

349
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:57,743
they're gonna come to me first.

350
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,249
And I don't need that.
- Just 'cause you owned a copy

351
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:02,410
of the book?
- Just because I own a copy--

352
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,921
- Never made a bomb yourself?
- No. Oh, I've made 'em.

353
00:17:06,057 --> 00:17:08,582
It was nothing big; it wasn't
even as big as a pipe bomb.

354
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,025
It was just... some make it
like a little tennis-ball bomb

355
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:12,561
or something like that.

356
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,792
Out of the "Anarchist Cookbook,"
the latest thing I built...

357
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,531
I think, would have to be...
I think I made it, like,

358
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:25,370
about a good five-gallon drum
of napalm.

359
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,411
You know, homemade napalm.

360
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,912
- Kids knew that
you were doing this?

361
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:31,879
- Yeah.
- So you were number two, then,

362
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,382
on the list.
- Right.

363
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:35,383
- Who was number one?
- I don't know.

364
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,047
They never told me that name.
Which kind of made me mad.

365
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,715
'Cause I didn't make it
to number one.

366
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,385
I know it's kind of silly,
but I guess

367
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:48,226
it'd been kind of an ego thing,
knowing that I was number one

368
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:51,802
at something in Oscoda, even
if it was a bomb-threat list.

369
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,802
- Do you believe it was right

370
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,237
to blow up the building
in Oklahoma City?

371
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:58,569
I'm not saying you did it.
- No. No, no, no.

372
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,076
- I'm just saying: was it right?
- Why was it "blowed up"?

373
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:03,476
That's a good question. Why
was that building "blowed up"?

374
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,413
And who blew it up?
- But if someone did it,

375
00:18:06,551 --> 00:18:08,075
it would be wrong.
- Yeah.

376
00:18:08,219 --> 00:18:10,687
- It is wrong to take the lives
of those people.

377
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:13,120
- Yeah.

378
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:17,524
I use the pen. 'Cause the pen
is mightier than the sword.

379
00:18:17,662 --> 00:18:22,156
But you always must keep a sword
handy, for when the pen fails.

380
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,497
I sleep with a .44 Magnum
under my pillow.

381
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,868
- Come on...
That's what everyone says.

382
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,032
Is that true?
- It's true.

383
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,371
- If we were to go--
- The whole world knows that.

384
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:36,537
- ...look under your pillow right
now, would we see a .44 Magnum?

385
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:38,205
- Yeah.
- Honestly?

386
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,012
Would you take us and show us?
Right now?

387
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:43,518
He took me into his bedroom,
but told the cameraman

388
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,350
to stay out. Sure enough,

389
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,550
there was a .44 Magnum
under his pillow.

390
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:50,888
There it is. Okay.
Is it loaded?

391
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,496
- Aye-yay-yay.

392
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,327
- Okay. I believe you.

393
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,334
NICHOLS HAS COCKED THE GUN
AND PUT IT TO HIS TEMPLE.

394
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,700
[ laughing ]
Don't do that!

395
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,466
You put the gun to your head.
- I know!

396
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:03,801
- Jeez!
- I'm not gonna get hurt!

397
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,672
- This is loaded.
- It's loaded, it's safe.

398
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:09,746
You've got to pull the trigger,
pull the hammer and shoot it.

399
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:12,748
- Mm, put the hammer back.
- No one has a right to tell me

400
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:15,444
that I can't have it.
That is protected

401
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,748
in our constitution.
- Where's it say a handgun

402
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:19,754
is protected?
- No, gun. We should...

403
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:21,415
Every citizen--
- It doesn't say "gun"!

404
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:23,424
It says "arms."
- Arms. What is arms?

405
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:25,756
- Could be a nuclear weapon.
- It's not these-- That's right,

406
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:28,263
it could be a nuclear weapon!
- You think you should have

407
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,766
the right to have weapons-grade
plutonium here on the farm?

408
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:32,267
- We should be able
to have anything--

409
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,769
- Should you have
weapons-grade plutonium?

410
00:19:33,905 --> 00:19:36,100
- I don't want it.
- But should you have the right

411
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,607
to have it if you did want it?
- That should be restricted.

412
00:19:38,743 --> 00:19:41,234
- Ah! Ah, so you do believe
in some restrictions.

413
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:45,281
- Well, there's wackos out there.

414
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,443
"Happiness is a warm gun

[ TV news ]: The town of Virgin,

416
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:56,489
Utah, has passed a law requiring
all residents to own guns.

417
00:20:12,777 --> 00:20:15,075
- Cary McWilliams
proudly displays the target

418
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:17,477
he used to pass
his shooting test.

419
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:19,446
But the thing is,
he can't see it.

420
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:22,576
He's blind.

421
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,586
Cary has had a love affair
with guns

422
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,783
since he first got his hands
on an M-16 as a teenager.

423
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:32,090
- I'm actually most comfortable
with assault rifles.

424
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,095
- Woo-hoo!

425
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:53,709
- This is a great place
to raise your children.

426
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,843
A really great place
to raise your kids.

427
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:59,445
Very close-knit community
we have here.

428
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,855
Everybody looks out
for everybody.

429
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:04,018
- Good people.
- Good people.

430
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,962
- This just happens to be
a place where two young men

431
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:10,397
made very bad,
very wrong decisions.

432
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:14,062
And there's been international
notoriety as a result of it.

433
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:15,570
Other than that,

434
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,902
I don't know that Littleton
is a lot different

435
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:21,136
than a whole lot
of other suburban communities.

Economic Development P.R. Video

437
00:21:27,652 --> 00:21:29,620
- Good morning, Mr. Edwards,
members of the board.

438
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:32,349
I'd like to report that
I've found the perfect location

439
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,357
for our new corporate office,
South Metro Denver.

440
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:37,290
You can see,

441
00:21:37,428 --> 00:21:40,090
I don't need these.
Because South Metro Denver

442
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:43,257
has about the same amount
of sunshine and precipitation

443
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:45,164
as Southern California.
It's so incredible,

444
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:47,828
you're just gonna have
to see it for yourselves.

445
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:50,133
How's this look, Mr. Edwards?

446
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:02,216
Denny Fennel
Home Security Consultant

447
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,755
- We're south of Denver,
in a community called Littleton,

448
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,791
and this house is pretty much

449
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:10,258
your average middle-class
suburban home.

450
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:12,226
The burglar or the rapist
is still here

451
00:22:12,363 --> 00:22:13,728
in the neighbourhood somewhere.

452
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,561
And so citizens
sometimes think that...

453
00:22:16,701 --> 00:22:18,396
I have people tell me
all the time--

454
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:22,267
- Where exactly is the burglar
or rapist right now?

455
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:25,001
If I was to try and stab you
through this, right here,

456
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,577
you're gonna have to be
really close. Right?

457
00:22:27,712 --> 00:22:29,737
- And here's the bottom line
on this.

458
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,246
- What if I had a spear?

459
00:22:31,382 --> 00:22:34,840
- Now, downstairs is where
the safe-room was constructed,

460
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:37,921
and this is a solid-core door,
a very heavy door.

461
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:41,082
And now, the criminal
has to break through this door,

462
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,750
so you've created
another barrier.

463
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,727
- An axe would do it.
- An axe would do it.

464
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,424
I think that Columbine
did a couple of things.

465
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:52,764
One is that it changed how
we talk. That's the first thing.

466
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,099
- How's that?
- Well, for instance,

467
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,367
if I say "Columbine,"
everybody knows what it means.

468
00:22:57,508 --> 00:23:03,606
I don't have to explain to you
that Columbine...

469
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:06,444
- Is... What's wrong?
- Nothing, I just...

470
00:23:06,584 --> 00:23:08,711
- What's wrong?
- I-- I just...

471
00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:12,550
sometimes Columbine bothers me.
I'll be fine. Just a minute.

472
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,250
- That's okay, that's okay.
- Um...

473
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:22,424
There...
there's something, um...

474
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:30,069
something overwhelming about
that kind of... viciousness,

475
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:37,239
that kind of predatory action,
that kind of indiscriminate, uh,

476
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,782
killing.

477
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,852
World's Largest Weapons Maker

478
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,249
- This facility,
where we're located right now...

479
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,359
Evan McCollum
Lockheed Martin Public Relations

480
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,527
and two other major facilities
where our employees work

481
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,927
are either in
or very near Littleton.

482
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:57,091
So we have over 5,000 employees
at these facilities,

483
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:59,601
quite a number of whom
live in Littleton,

484
00:23:59,737 --> 00:24:02,467
many of whom have children who
attend Columbine High School.

485
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,440
I suppose in one way you could
say that what happened

486
00:24:05,576 --> 00:24:07,840
at Columbine High School
is a microcosm, uh...

487
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:11,039
of what happens
throughout the world.

488
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:13,514
- You know the signs
that we see around here,

489
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:15,448
the ones that say:
"We Are Columbine,"

490
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:19,147
is that how you,
Lockheed Martin, feels,

491
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,053
that you're the biggest employer
here in Littleton,

492
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:23,057
you're the biggest weapons-
maker? "We Are Columbine."

493
00:24:23,194 --> 00:24:25,890
- I think we probably
embody that spirit,

494
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,055
that, yeah, we're all members
of this community

495
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:30,895
and that it behoves us to help
one another and to reach out

496
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:32,400
to assist one another, yeah.

497
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,562
- He told us that no one
in Littleton,

498
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:36,071
including the executives

499
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:39,404
at Lockheed, could figure out
why the boys at Columbine

500
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,239
had resorted to violence.

501
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,074
- Why would kids do this?

502
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:47,913
Uh, some of the root of that
probably has to do

503
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:50,919
with their anger
about various issues

504
00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:53,421
and we became aware of a program

505
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,355
that provides
anger-management training.

506
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:58,553
And so we made
a $100,000 contribution

507
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:01,563
to the Jefferson County schools
to use this training

508
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:05,601
in the schools. We hope to help
both teachers and students

509
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:10,231
learn alternative ways
to deal with anger.

510
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,707
- So you don't think our kids
say to themselves:

511
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,402
"Well, gee, Dad goes off

512
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:16,775
to the factory every day
and, you know,

513
00:25:16,914 --> 00:25:20,577
he built missiles." These
are weapons of mass destruction.

514
00:25:20,718 --> 00:25:22,709
What's the difference
between that mass destruction

515
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:26,381
and the mass destruction
over at Columbine High School?

516
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,355
- I guess I don't see
that connection,

517
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:32,395
that specific connection,
because the missiles

518
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,363
that you're talking about were
built and designed to defend us

519
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,628
from somebody else who would be
aggressors against us.

520
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,000
Societies and countries
and governments do things

521
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:42,902
that annoy one another.

522
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,704
But we have to learn
to deal with that annoyance

523
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:50,143
or that anger or that
frustration in appropriate ways.

524
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:51,942
We don't get irritated
with somebody

525
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,948
and just 'cause we're mad
at them, uh,

526
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:57,987
drop a bomb or shoot at them,
or fire a missile at them.

- Why in the hell not?
It's been over an hour!

669
00:33:10,387 --> 00:33:11,752
- My son is Eric Harris,

670
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,914
and I'm afraid
that he might be involved

671
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,719
with the shooting
at Columbine High School.

672
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,760
- Involved how?

673
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:20,921
- He's a member of what they're
calling the "trench-coat mafia."

674
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,260
- Have you spoken to your son?
- No, I haven't.

675
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,561
Have they picked up anybody yet?
- They're still looking

676
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:29,195
for suspects. Your son
is with who? What gang?

677
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,537
- They call them the "trench-coat
mafia". I just heard that term

678
00:33:32,676 --> 00:33:34,576
on TV.
- Stay low, because if you try

679
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,737
to leave, I don't want you
to get shot.

680
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:38,280
Stay very low and quiet.

681
00:33:38,415 --> 00:33:40,110
Low and quiet...

682

- Everybody just stay quiet.

683
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:03,438
- When the shooting was over,
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold

684
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:07,601
had killed 12 students
and one teacher.

685
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:11,306
Dozens of others were wounded
by the over-900 rounds of ammo

686
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:13,973
that were fired. It is believed
that the guns that they used

687
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:17,554
were all legally purchased
at stores and gun shows.

688
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,747
And many of the bullets
were bought

689
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:23,257
at the Littleton K-Mart
just down the street.

690
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,794
- Harris's diary also detailed
ideas about hijacking

691
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,558
an airplane and crashing it
into New York City.

692
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,099
Some may characterize that
as fantasy...

693
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:36,605
- In the end, they turned
the guns on themselves.

694
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,970
- And then he came
into the library,

695
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:42,601
shot everybody around me,
then put a gun to my head

696
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:45,647
and asked if we all wanted
to die and...

697
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,808
- We started hearing shots
in the hall

698
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,352
and then they came in
and they all told us

699
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:53,012
to get under the desk
and we all got under the desk

700
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:57,150
and then they started coming in
the library and opening fire...

701
00:34:57,294 --> 00:34:59,819
- I just started screaming
and crying and telling them

702
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:03,229
not to shoot me.
And so he shot the girl,

703
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,097
he shot her in the head
in front of me.

704
00:35:06,236 --> 00:35:10,502
Then he shot the black kid,
because he was black.

705
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:15,507

We don't want you here."

723

I said to the mayor,
"This is our country.

If my son Daniel
was not one of the victims,

into the middle of a child's

Something is wrong.

It is time to address
this problem.

00:41:52,242 --> 00:41:54,938
This second-grader in Illinois
was suspended for 10 days

836
00:41:55,078 --> 00:41:56,773
for bringing a nail clipper
to class

837
00:41:56,913 --> 00:41:58,608
"That's a weapon,"
his school said.

838
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,842
- An elementary school
suspended a first-grader

839
00:42:00,984 --> 00:42:03,282
for pointing a chicken strip
at a teacher in the cafeteria.

840
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,014
The eight-year-old
was fooling around with a friend

841
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:09,057
at lunch last week when he
pointed a breaded-chicken finger

842
00:42:09,192 --> 00:42:11,285
at a teacher and then said:
"Pow pow.

843
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,623
- He pointed a folded piece
of paper shaped like a gun,

844
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,959
and told his classmates
he was going to kill them

845
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:18,294
during a game
of cops and robbers.

846
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:21,302
- If this isn't a warning sign,
then what is it?

847
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,565
- This Virginia high-school
student spent a month

848
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,197
out of classes,
originally sent home

849
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:28,038
for dying his hair blue.
- A high-school honour student

850
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:30,237
from Michigan could be expelled
later today

851
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,813
in a school-board hearing.

852
00:42:31,948 --> 00:42:34,416
Seventeen-year-old Jeremy Hicks
wore a Scottish

853
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:38,214
bagpiper's outfit to his junior
prom that included

854
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:41,756
a plaid kilt, a feathered hat
and a traditional knife

855
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,655
known as a "skein dhu."

856
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:45,318
- This T-shirt

857
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:46,929
landed a high-school student
in court.

858
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,157
She wanted to start
an anarchy club.

859
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:51,426
- The little time-bombs
that are out there ticking,

860
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:54,435
waiting to go off. And there are
many of them in every community.

861
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:56,937
- Students in at least seven
different states

862
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,632
have been suspended or arrested

863
00:42:58,775 --> 00:43:02,176
for talking about or planning
plots of their own.

864
00:43:02,312 --> 00:43:03,939
- It's almost
like guerrilla warfare.

865
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,049
You don't know
from which direction

866
00:43:06,149 --> 00:43:07,480
the enemy will be coming.

867
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:11,618
Marketing video from
Garrett Metal Detectors

868
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:12,949
- Having a well-conceived
and strictly enforced dress code

869
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,422
can dramatically improve
the safety of a school,

870
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,617
and can ensure a positive
learning environment

871
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,125
for everyone.

872
00:43:18,261 --> 00:43:20,525
As this student's appearance
demonstrates,

873
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:23,724
having a lax policy about dress
makes it easy

874
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,698
for a student
to conceal a weapon

875
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:29,602
and makes it difficult
to identify intruders on campus.

876
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:32,401
A dress code can reduce
weapons violations,

877
00:43:32,542 --> 00:43:37,002
relieve tensions between gangs,
reduce disciplinary infractions

878
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:39,945
and generally improve
the atmosphere of the school.

879
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:43,314
Our policy requires that
students tuck in their shirts,

880
00:43:43,453 --> 00:43:46,217
making the beltline visible
at all times.

881
00:43:46,356 --> 00:43:48,586
Our students may not wear
baggy pants

882
00:43:48,725 --> 00:43:51,751
or colours or insignias
that are commonly associated

883
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:53,590
with gang activity.

884
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,528
This policy
was a collaborative effort.

885
00:43:56,666 --> 00:44:00,124
- Yes, our children were indeed
something to fear.

886
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:05,502
They had turned
into little monsters.

887
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:07,837
But who was to blame?

888
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,411
All the experts had an answer.

889
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:13,073
- Angry, heavy-metal subculture.

890
00:44:13,216 --> 00:44:15,582
- Where were the parents?
- Violent movies.

891
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,984
- "South Park." - Video games.
- Television. - Entertainment.

892
00:44:19,122 --> 00:44:21,716
- Satan. - Cartoons.
- Films. - Society. - Toy guns.

893
00:44:21,858 --> 00:44:24,759
- Drugs.
- Shock-rocker Marilyn Manson.

894
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:27,830
[ all ]: Marilyn Manson.

895
00:44:27,964 --> 00:44:30,558
- Marilyn Manson has cancelled
the last five dates

896
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:34,067
of his U.S, tour out of respect
for those lost in Littleton.

897
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,604
But the singer
says artists like himself

898
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,605
are not the ones to blame.

899
00:44:40,677 --> 00:44:42,440
- This is perhaps
the sickest group ever promoted

900
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:45,276
by a mainstream record company.

901
00:44:45,415 --> 00:44:47,508
"I'm not a slave

902
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:49,175
"to a god

903
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:52,015
"that doesn't exist"

904
00:44:52,155 --> 00:44:53,918
- After Columbine, it seemed

905
00:44:54,057 --> 00:44:56,491
that the entire focus
on why the shootings occurred

906
00:44:56,626 --> 00:44:57,888
was because the killers

907
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,258
listened to Marilyn Manson.

908
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:02,262
Two years after Columbine,

909
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:04,594
Manson finally returned
to Denver.

910
00:45:04,734 --> 00:45:06,565
- The Oz Fest
at Mile High Stadium

911
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:08,898
brings shock-rocker Marilyn
Manson to Denver tomorrow.

912
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,304
- There were protests
from the religious right.

913
00:45:12,442 --> 00:45:14,535
But I thought I'd go
and talk with him myself.

914
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:17,078
- When I was a kid growing up,
music was the escape.

915
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,079
That's the only thing

916
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:23,050
that had no judgements.
You can put on a record

917
00:45:23,186 --> 00:45:26,485
and it's not gonna yell at you
for dressing the way you do.

918
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:28,818
It's gonna make you
feel better about it.

919
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:32,156
- Some will be so brash
to ask if we believe

920
00:45:32,295 --> 00:45:34,490
that all who hear Manson
tomorrow night

921
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,861
will go out
and commit violent acts.

922
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,992
The answer is "no."
But does everybody

923
00:45:40,136 --> 00:45:43,071
who watches a Lexus ad
go and buy a Lexus?

924
00:45:43,206 --> 00:45:45,333
No. But a few do.

925
00:45:45,475 --> 00:45:48,774
- I definitely can see
why they would pick me,

926
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:52,313
because I think it's easy
to throw my face on a TV,

927
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:56,977
because I'm, in the end,
sort of a poster boy for fear.

928
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,453
Because I represent
what everyone's afraid of,

929
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,854
because I do and say
what I want.

930
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:06,087
- If Marilyn Manson can walk
into our town and promote hate,

931
00:46:06,229 --> 00:46:09,096
violence, suicide,
death, drug use

932
00:46:09,232 --> 00:46:11,029
and Columbine-like behaviour,

933
00:46:11,167 --> 00:46:14,364
I can say, "Not without
a fight, you can't."

934
00:46:14,504 --> 00:46:19,999
- The two by-products of
that whole tragedy were, uh...

935
00:46:20,143 --> 00:46:22,611
violence in entertainment
and gun control.

936
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:25,874
And how perfect that
that was the two things

937
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:28,041
that we were gonna talk about
with the upcoming election.

938
00:46:28,184 --> 00:46:30,550
And also, then we forgot
about Monica Lewinsky

939
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,552
and we forgot about...

940
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:35,055
The president was shooting
bombs overseas,

941
00:46:35,191 --> 00:46:41,061
yet I'm a bad guy because I sing
some rock'n'roll songs.

942
00:46:41,197 --> 00:46:44,064
And who's a bigger influence,
the president or Marilyn Manson?

943
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,828
I'd like to think me, but I'm
gonna go with the president.

944
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,063
- Do you know the day
that Columbine happened,

945
00:46:49,205 --> 00:46:51,571
the United States dropped
more bombs on Kosovo

946
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,573
than any other time
during that war?

947
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,008
- I do know that and I think
that's really ironic,

948
00:46:56,146 --> 00:47:00,082
that nobody said, "Well, maybe
the president had an influence

949
00:47:00,216 --> 00:47:02,081
on this violent behaviour.

950
00:47:02,218 --> 00:47:04,413
Because that's not the way
the media wants to take it

951
00:47:04,554 --> 00:47:06,545
and spin it
and turn it into fear.

952
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,555
'Cause then you're
watching television,

953
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:11,525
you're watching the news; you're
being pumped full of fear.

954
00:47:11,661 --> 00:47:14,221
And there's floods,
there's AIDS, there's murder.

955
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:18,027
You cut to commercial,
buy the Acura, buy the Colgate.

956
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,534
If you have bad breath,
they're not gonna talk to you.

957
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:23,366
If you got pimples,
the girl's not gonna fuck you.

958
00:47:23,506 --> 00:47:27,909
It's a campaign of fear
and consumption.

959
00:47:28,044 --> 00:47:30,035
And that's what I think
that's it's all based on,

960
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,842
is the whole idea that:
keep everyone afraid,

961
00:47:32,982 --> 00:47:36,383
and they'll consume.
And that's really as simple

962
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:38,749
as it can be boiled down to.
- Right.

963
00:47:38,888 --> 00:47:41,049
If you were to talk directly
to the kids at Columbine

964
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,056
and the people
in that community,

965
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,559
what would you say to them,
if they here right now?

966
00:47:45,695 --> 00:47:47,560
- I wouldn't say
a single word to them.

967
00:47:47,697 --> 00:47:49,562
I would listen to what
they have to say.

968
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:52,327
And that's what no one did.

969
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:55,063
- I'm Nicole Shleif.
- And I'm Amanda Lamontagne.

970
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,173
- And you went to Columbine?
- Yes.

971
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,400
- And you were with
Eric and Dylan?

972
00:47:59,542 --> 00:48:01,407
In their class?
- Yeah,

973
00:48:01,544 --> 00:48:04,069
we were in their bowling class.
- In their bowling class?

974
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,079
- Yes.
- What's bowling class?

975
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,913
- Just an elective you can
take for a gym credit.

976
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,544
- Where's the educational value
of this, though?

977
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:17,023
- Um... I guess
there isn't really any.

978
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,025
- No, there's not.

979
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:23,292
- I learned how to bowl a lot
better, that's for sure.

980
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:25,526
- What were Eric Harris
and Dylan Klebold like?

981
00:48:25,668 --> 00:48:27,533
- Weird.
- Yeah?

982
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:29,535
- I mean, not very social.

983
00:48:29,672 --> 00:48:31,537
- I didn't really know
who they were.

984
00:48:31,674 --> 00:48:35,166
- Not very social, just
kinda kept to themselves.

985
00:48:35,311 --> 00:48:37,643
- How good a bowlers
were Eric and Dylan?

986
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:40,113
- When we played them,

987
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,548
all I remember is they
were just, like, crazy.

988
00:48:42,685 --> 00:48:44,949
They would just chuck the ball.
- Chuck it down there.

989
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:48,057
- Throw the ball down; didn't
really care how they bowled.

990
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,352
- Yeah, they didn't really
care about their scores.

991
00:48:50,493 --> 00:48:52,461
Deputy Sheriff Steve Davis - What were
the suspects doing the morning of attack?

992
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:54,190
I told you that I'd heard
that they were bowling;

993
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:56,093
that's the only thing
I'm aware of.

994
00:48:56,232 --> 00:48:59,065
- So did Dylan and Eric
show up that morning

995
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:01,261
and bowl two games
before moving on

996
00:49:01,404 --> 00:49:03,269
to shoot up the school?

997
00:49:03,406 --> 00:49:05,738
And did they just chuck
the balls down the lane?

998
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:07,740
Did this mean something?

999
00:49:07,877 --> 00:49:10,903
- Um, I guess they went
to their favourite class.

1000
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:14,540
- Why wasn't anyone
blaming bowling

1001
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:15,844
for warping the minds
of Eric and Dylan

1002
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:17,647
to commit their evil deeds?

1003
00:49:17,787 --> 00:49:22,156
Wasn't that just as plausible
as blaming Marilyn Manson?

1004
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,192
After all,

1005
00:49:24,327 --> 00:49:26,192
it was apparently
the last thing they did

1006
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:28,991
before the massacre.

1007
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,862
But wait a minute. There's
lots of bowling going on

1008
00:49:32,001 --> 00:49:35,493
in other countries.

1009
00:49:35,638 --> 00:49:38,004
And don't they listen
to Marilyn Manson in Germany,

1010
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,075
the home of sinister
Goth music?

1011
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,337
- Some Gothic festival.
"Ah"

1012
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,812
- Don't they watch the same
violent movies in France?

1013
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:52,584
Most of the violent video
games are from Japan.

1014
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:56,522
Many people in America believe

1015
00:49:56,659 --> 00:49:59,093
that it's the break-up
of the family unit

1016
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:01,129
that's caused so many wayward
youth to turn to violence.

1017
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:03,630
- I'll save you the trouble.
I'll run away and kill myself!

1018
00:50:03,766 --> 00:50:06,132
How would you like that?
You can't keep me here!

1019
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:07,759
- But statistics show

1020
00:50:07,904 --> 00:50:09,997
that there are more
broken homes and divorce

1021
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:11,834
in Great Britain
than in the U.S.

1022
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:15,672
- It's official:
Fergie's marriage has ended.

1023
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:19,407
- Liberals contend that it's all
the poverty we have in America

1024
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,346
that causes all this violence.

1025
00:50:21,484 --> 00:50:23,577
But the unemployment rate
in Canada

1026
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,587
is twice what it is here.
Of course, most people say

1027
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:29,487
it's because we Americans
have a violent history,

1028
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:31,856
a violent past.
Cowboys and Indians,

1029
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:34,020
the Wild West,

1030
00:50:34,163 --> 00:50:36,097
a history of conquering
and bloodshed.

1031
00:50:36,232 --> 00:50:38,097
Well, if that's all
it takes to end up

1032
00:50:38,234 --> 00:50:40,464
with such a violent society

1033
00:50:40,603 --> 00:50:42,503
like we have in America,
how do you explain this?

1034
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,706
GERMANS EXTERMINATE 12 MILLION

1035
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:50,037
JAPANESE OCCUPATION OF CHINA

1036
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:56,777
FRENCH MASSACRE IN ALGIERS

1037
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:02,589
BRITISH SLAUGHTER IN INDIA

1038
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:06,018
Yet in spite of all this,

1039
00:51:06,162 --> 00:51:07,527
how many people are killed
by guns each year?

1040
00:51:09,632 --> 00:51:11,725
In Germany:

1041
00:51:13,469 --> 00:51:15,130
In France:

1042
00:51:18,107 --> 00:51:20,405
In Canada:

1043
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:25,147
In the United Kingdom:

1044
00:51:28,117 --> 00:51:30,142
In Australia:

1045
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:33,950
In Japan:

1046
00:51:36,759 --> 00:51:38,659
In the United States:

1047
00:51:43,232 --> 00:51:46,998
- But that, to me, brings up
an important question:

1048
00:51:47,136 --> 00:51:49,604
Then what is so different
about Americans?

1049
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,866
Tom Mauser
Father of Columbine victim

1050
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,201
Are we homicidal in nature?

1051
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,512
Because in Europe and Australia,

1052
00:51:57,647 --> 00:52:00,115
most other free-world countries,
they don't have this.

1053
00:52:00,249 --> 00:52:03,616
They don't have people who snap
and go on murderous rampages.

1054
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:06,221
- Well, no, they're just like us.
They have the occasional person

1055
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:08,620
that snaps and kills
a lot of people.

1056
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:11,591
How about a British soccer riot?
Those aren't Quakers there,

1057
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:13,719
- Every time that
I bring up comparisons

1058
00:52:13,863 --> 00:52:15,728
with other free-world countries,
what I hear is:

1059
00:52:15,865 --> 00:52:17,890
"Oh, our culture is so
different. We're so different."

1060
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:20,059
And as you said, they have
violent video games,

1061
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:23,070
they have violent movies,
they have alienated youth,

1062
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:26,073
they - like us - don't have
prayer in schools.

1063
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:30,441
What is so radically different?
What is it about us?

1064
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,571
- What is it?
- What is it?

1065
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:34,576
- What is it?
- What is it?

1066
00:52:34,717 --> 00:52:37,447
I don't know.

1067
00:52:39,889 --> 00:52:42,619
- Now, it's time for...

1068
00:52:42,725 --> 00:52:44,886
Hi, boys and girls.
Ready to get started?

1069
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:46,962
Once upon a time, there were
these people in Europe

1070
00:52:47,096 --> 00:52:50,964
called pilgrims and they were
afraid of being persecuted.

1071
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,728
So they all got in a boat
and sailed to the New World

1072
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:56,532
where they wouldn't have
to be scared ever again.

1073
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,437
- Oh, I'm so relaxed.
- I feel so much safer.

1074
00:52:59,575 --> 00:53:02,567
- But as soon as they arrived,
they were greeted by savages.

1075
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:04,907
They got scared all over again.
- Injuns!

1076
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:06,675
- So they killed them all.
Now, you'd think

1077
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:09,376
wiping out a race of people
would calm them down, but no.

1078
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,749
Instead, they started getting
frightened of each other.

1079
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:14,049
[ both ]: Witch!
- So they burned witches.

1080
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,555
In 1775,

1081
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,456
they started killing the
British, so they could be free.

1082
00:53:18,594 --> 00:53:21,358
And it worked.
But they still didn't feel safe.

1083
00:53:21,497 --> 00:53:24,523
So they passed a 2nd amendment,
which said every white man

1084
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:26,828
could keep his gun.
- I loves my gun, loves my gun.

1085
00:53:26,969 --> 00:53:29,767
- This brings us to
the genius idea of slavery.

1086
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,840
You see, boys and girls,
the white people back then

1087
00:53:31,974 --> 00:53:34,306
were also afraid of doing any
work. So they went to Africa,

1088
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:36,605
kidnapped thousands of black
people, brought them to America,

1089
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:38,873
and forced them to work
very hard for no money.

1090
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:40,880
And I don't mean no money like:

1091
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:42,780
"I work at Wal-Mart
and make no money."

1092
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:45,080
I mean zero dollars.
Nothing, nada, zip.

1093
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:47,086
Doing it that way made the USA

1094
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:48,918
the richest country
in the world.

1095
00:53:49,058 --> 00:53:51,083
So did having all that money
and free help

1096
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:54,094
calm the white people down? No
way. They got even more afraid.

1097
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,460
That's because after
200 years of slavery,

1098
00:53:56,599 --> 00:53:58,999
the black people now outnumbered
the white people in many parts

1099
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:01,365
of the South. Well, you can
pretty much what came next.

1100
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,404
The slaves started rebelling.
There were uprisings

1101
00:54:03,539 --> 00:54:05,234
and old masters' heads
got chopped off

1102
00:54:05,374 --> 00:54:07,672
and when white people heard of
this, they were freaking out.

1103
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:09,607
They going:
- I want to live!

1104
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,509
Don't kill me, big black man.

1105
00:54:11,647 --> 00:54:14,582
- Well, just in the nick of time
came Samuel Colt, who,

1106
00:54:14,717 --> 00:54:17,515
in 1836, invented the first
weapon ever that could be fired

1107
00:54:17,653 --> 00:54:19,416
over and over without
having to reload.

1108
00:54:19,555 --> 00:54:22,183
And all the settlers were, like:
- Yee-hah!

1109
00:54:22,325 --> 00:54:25,453
- But it was too late.
The North soon won the Civil War

1110
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:30,123
and the slaves were free to go
chop the old masters' heads off.

1111
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:32,496
Then everybody was, like:
- Oh, no, we're gonna die.

1112
00:54:32,635 --> 00:54:35,001
- But the freed slaves
took no revenge.

1113
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:37,572
They just wanted
to live in peace.

1114
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:40,301
But you couldn't convince
the white people of this.

1115
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,435
So they formed the Ku Klux Klan
and, in 1871,

1116
00:54:43,579 --> 00:54:46,548
the same year the Klan became an
illegal terrorist organization,

1117
00:54:46,682 --> 00:54:50,379
another group was founded:
the National Rifle Association.

1118
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,488
Soon, politicians passed
one of the first gun laws,

1119
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,750
making it illegal for any black
person to own one.

1120
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:59,123
It was a great year for America.
he KKK and the NRA.

1121
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:01,127
Of course, they had nothing
to do with each other;

1122
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:03,892
it was a coincidence. One group
legally promoted responsible

1123
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:06,900
gun ownership; the other shot
and lynched black people.

1124
00:55:07,036 --> 00:55:09,231
That's the way it was till
1955, when a black woman

1125
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:12,273
broke the law by refusing to
move to the back of the bus.

1126
00:55:12,408 --> 00:55:13,670
White people just couldn't
believe it.

1127
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,973
- Huh? Why won't she move?
- What's going on?

1128
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:20,048
- Man, all hell broke loose.
Black people everywhere demanded

1129
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:23,914
their rights. White people had
a major, freaky-feel meltdown

1130
00:55:24,053 --> 00:55:26,544
and they were all, like:
- Run away! Run away!

1131
00:55:26,689 --> 00:55:28,714
- And they did. They all ran
fleeing to the suburbs,

1132
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:31,326
where it was all white and safe
and clean. And they went out

1133
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,325
and bought a
quarter-of-a-billion guns.

1134
00:55:33,462 --> 00:55:35,396
And put locks on their doors,
alarms in their houses,

1135
00:55:35,531 --> 00:55:37,726
and gates around the
neighbourhoods.

1136
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:41,667
And finally, they were all safe
and secure and snug as a bug.

1137
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:50,836
And everyone lived
happily ever after.

1138
00:56:02,091 --> 00:56:03,752
- Because if you turn on
the evening news,

1139
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:07,624
America still seems
like a pretty scary place.

1140
00:56:07,763 --> 00:56:10,926
- Who is he? Is he dangerous?
What's he up to?

1141
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,462
- What are you trying
to pull, man?

1142
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:17,004
- Remember all the Y2Kscares?

1143
00:56:17,139 --> 00:56:20,472
Weren't we told that our very
society was about to collapse

1144
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,100
because somebody forgot

1145
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:24,179
to type in a couple of digits
on the computer?

1146
00:56:24,313 --> 00:56:26,611
- There's gonna be mass
chaos and confusion.

1147
00:56:26,749 --> 00:56:28,114
- Tonight, the countdown begins.

1148
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:30,116
All day, store director
Rick Smith

1149
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:34,485
watched consumers get Y2K ready.
- Batteries sell extremely well.

1150
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:37,388
The lamp oil, generators.

1151
00:56:37,526 --> 00:56:39,619
- After sending the country
into a panic,

1152
00:56:39,762 --> 00:56:41,957
the clock struck midnight...

1153
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:44,760
And nothing happened.

1154
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,892
Or how about those killer bees

1155
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,061
that were going
to attack America?

1156
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:51,730
- We're almost certain
they'll arrive this year.

1157
00:56:51,874 --> 00:56:54,468
- Shmidt expects the Africanized
bees to reach Texas this year,

1158
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,840
cross into Arizona in about
two to three years.

1159
00:56:56,979 --> 00:57:00,312
He's concerned because the
killer bee is overly aggressive.

1160
00:57:00,449 --> 00:57:02,917
- They will follow you
for half a mile.

1161
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:05,577
- The bees never came.

1162
00:57:05,721 --> 00:57:08,189
Remember the first time
you heard

1163
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:11,088
that someone had hidden a razor
blade in an apple at Halloween?

1164
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:12,751
Before long,

1165
00:57:12,895 --> 00:57:15,159
kids were not permitted to go
out in the dark on Halloween

1166
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:17,664
and go trick-or-treating
at strangers' homes.

1167
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,859
- Many people say they won't give
out candy treats on Halloween.

1168
00:57:20,002 --> 00:57:22,664
It's too dangerous
and they're too scared.

1169
00:57:22,805 --> 00:57:24,272
- Well, guess what?

1170
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:26,170
There never was any
razor blade in the apple.

1171
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:28,402
In fact, only two kids

1172
00:57:28,544 --> 00:57:32,207
in the past 40 years have been
killed by Halloween candy.

1173
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:34,578
And both of them were poisoned
on purpose by relatives.

1174
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,275
- Bye.

1175
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:38,853
[ reporter]: It was like
a scene from a horror movie.

1176
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:42,287
This man was mowing his lawn
when a fox darted out

1177
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:44,791
of the woods and attacked
his riding-mower.

1178
00:57:44,927 --> 00:57:47,191
- A warning about a popular
weight-loss supplement.

1179
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,298
What you don't know
may kill you.

1180
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:51,559
- You ride them every day,
but in an instant,

1181
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:54,795
an escalator can mangle you
or a loved one.

1182
00:57:54,937 --> 00:57:58,304
- We reveal why you may be
riding on stairway to danger.

1183
00:57:58,441 --> 00:57:59,373
- You might want to take
some extra precautions:

1184
00:57:59,508 --> 00:58:02,033
keep a low profile,
don't go around dancing

1185
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:04,738
with a bunch of Americans
in the streets.

1186
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,678
Make sure that you don't draw
a lot of attention to yourself

1187
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,148
and the fact
that you're American.

1188
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:11,753
- Nation's top doctor says
one in five Americans

1189
00:58:11,887 --> 00:58:13,718
suffers some form
of mental disorder.

1190
00:58:13,856 --> 00:58:16,347
The surgeon general David
Satcher pleads with people

1191
00:58:16,492 --> 00:58:18,221
to seek help now.

1192
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:21,990
- The media, the corporations,
the politicians,

1193
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:26,192
have all done such a good job
of scaring the American public,

1194
00:58:26,335 --> 00:58:29,031
it's come to the point
where they don't need to give

1195
00:58:29,171 --> 00:58:31,162
any reason at all.

1196
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:34,003
- Today, the Justice Department
did issue a...

1197
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:36,577
a blanket alert.

1198
00:58:39,181 --> 00:58:42,275
It was in recognition of a
general threat we received.

1199
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:45,546
Uh, this is not the first time

1200
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,952
the Justice Department
have acted like this.

1201
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:50,490
I hope it's the last.

1202
00:58:50,626 --> 00:58:54,528
But given the attitude of
the evildoers, it may not be.

1203
00:59:01,103 --> 00:59:03,003
- I just love these boulevards
down here, though.

1204
00:59:03,105 --> 00:59:04,697
You don't get this
in most of L.A.

1205
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,171
South Central
Los Angeles

1206
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:08,240
- How come whenever
I'm out here, though,

1207
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:10,574
I turn on the 11-o'clock news
and I hear, you know:

1208
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:13,079
"Tonight in South Central,
drive-by shooting."

1209
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:15,080
Or: "Tonight in South
Central..."

1210
00:59:15,317 --> 00:59:17,683
Prof. Barry Glassner
Author, "The Culture of Fear"

1211
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,082
...this, that or whatever. I mean,
they're not making that up, are they?

1212
00:59:20,222 --> 00:59:22,986
- No, they're not making it up,
but they're choosing

1213
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:26,390
what they're covering. If you
turn on the TV, on the news,

1214
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:28,895
what are you gonna hear about?

1215
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:32,967
Dangerous black guys, right?
Unnamed black guy who, you know,

1216
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:36,162
accused of some crime or...
- Right.

1217
00:59:36,305 --> 00:59:39,103
- You're gonna see pictures
of black guys doing bad things,

1218
00:59:39,241 --> 00:59:41,607
and hearing stories about black
guys doing bad things.

1219
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,609
And we've heard this
our whole lives.

1220
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,976
- Now, the suspect is a black
male in his twenties.

1221
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:48,106
We are told he has
a large afro, sideburns,

1222
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:50,377
he was wearing a
silver chain at the time.

1223
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:52,612
- Police say the suspect
is a black man.

1224
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:57,124
Six foot one, 160 to 180 pounds,
about 35 years in age.

1225
00:59:57,259 --> 00:59:59,921
- Suspect is a black male,
age 16 to 18.

1226
01:00:00,062 --> 01:00:02,030
- The suspect is
African-American.

1227
01:00:02,164 --> 01:00:03,461
Police believe--
- Police say--

1228
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:05,965
- The black man--
[ several ]: Suspect--

1229
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,229
- The suspect is a black male
- A black man.

1230
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:10,600
[ various voices ]:
A black... black... black...

1231
01:00:10,739 --> 01:00:11,865
- A black man.

1232
01:00:12,007 --> 01:00:14,498
- Susan Smith drowns
her two children.

1233
01:00:14,643 --> 01:00:17,077
She tells people a black guy...
- Correct.

1234
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:20,341
- Stole the car
and stole the kids.

1235
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:23,008
And everyone, at first,
bought it.

1236
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:26,144
- Some guy jumped into her car,
with her two kids in it.

1237
01:00:26,288 --> 01:00:28,381
Then he took off.
That's a black guy, she says.

1238
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:30,958
- Black male?
- Yes, Ma'am.

1239
01:00:31,093 --> 01:00:33,857
- And I told them I loved them.
I hollered I loved them

1240
01:00:33,996 --> 01:00:36,123
And it's just a tragedy.

1241
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:40,133
- The anonymous urban -
which means usually black -

1242
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:42,100
male, comes by and does this.

1243
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:44,365
It's the excuse
for all kinds of things.

1244
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:46,065
- Charles Stewart,
a lawyer in Boston...

1245
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:48,176
- Right, exactly.
- ...kills his pregnant wife,

1246
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:50,642
says a black guy did it;
everybody buys it.

1247
01:00:50,779 --> 01:00:53,805
- The suspect described as a
black male about six feet tall.

1248
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:56,179
Chuck and Carol Stewart
were robbed at gunpoint

1249
01:00:56,318 --> 01:00:58,183
as they left a Lamaze class.

1250
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,311
It seemed the ultimate
urban nightmare.

1251
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:02,720
- You know, the thing I love
about this country of mine,

1252
01:01:02,858 --> 01:01:05,349
is that whether you're
a psychotic killer

1253
01:01:05,494 --> 01:01:07,985
or running for president
of the United States,

1254
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:10,564
the one thing you can
always count on

1255
01:01:10,699 --> 01:01:13,827
is white America's fear
of the black man.

1256
01:01:13,969 --> 01:01:16,836
- We've heard the stories
on the news and in the papers

1257
01:01:16,972 --> 01:01:18,837
and they have killed people.

1258
01:01:18,974 --> 01:01:20,669
Killer bees, also known

1259
01:01:20,809 --> 01:01:22,276
as "Africanized" bees.

1260
01:01:22,411 --> 01:01:24,675
- I'm scared. I'm really worried.

1261
01:01:24,813 --> 01:01:28,010
- Rose Shipley never expected a
nest of Africanized killer bees

1262
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:30,345
to shack up across the street
from her.

1263
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:33,512
- But I'm terribly allergic
to them and so are my grandkids.

1264
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:35,214
- They're originally from
southern and eastern Africa.

1265
01:01:35,357 --> 01:01:39,054
Dr. Warrick Care brought some
to Brazil in 1956

1266
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,186
and tried to mate them

1267
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:44,094
with the European bee,
the kind that we're used to.

1268
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:47,634
But they got loose and moved
to the southern United States.

1269
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,237
- The main difference between
a traditional honey bee

1270
01:01:49,371 --> 01:01:52,431
and an Africanized bee is
the bee's aggressiveness.

1271
01:01:52,575 --> 01:01:55,738
If I was to do this
to an Africanized bee's hive,

1272
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:59,041
I could have several hundred
stings in a matter of minutes.

1273
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:01,479
- Danny Self raises the kinder,
gentler European bees,

1274
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:03,107
and he's done the research.

1275
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:04,947
- The only way that you can tell

1276
01:02:05,087 --> 01:02:07,817
the two of them, is doing
measurements on the body parts.

1277
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:10,687
- Quite frankly,
the black community has become

1278
01:02:10,826 --> 01:02:13,158
entertainment for the rest
of the community.

1279
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,662
- Meaning what?

1280
01:02:14,863 --> 01:02:16,125
Arthur Busch
County Prosecutor - Flint, Michigan

1281
01:02:16,198 --> 01:02:18,063
- The entertainment being
that the crime of the day -

1282
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,065
you know, "If it bleeds,
it leads" -

1283
01:02:20,202 --> 01:02:24,070
gets to be the front story and
then that becomes the perception

1284
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:27,573
and the image of
an entire people.

1285
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:30,577
Which couldn't be further
from the truth, in my opinion.

1286
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:33,580
In fact, you'll find, I think,

1287
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:36,810
most African-Americans are quite
adverse to gun possession.

1288
01:02:38,887 --> 01:02:40,650
In suburbia, I think,

1289
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:42,654
there's some notion that there's
going to be an invading horde,

1290
01:02:42,791 --> 01:02:46,818
come from either the city
or from someplace unknown,

1291
01:02:46,962 --> 01:02:50,261
to savage their suburban
community.

1292
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:56,167
To me, not only is it bizarre,
but it's totally, uh...

1293
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:58,773
unfounded.

1294
01:02:58,907 --> 01:03:00,534
And these pistols,
curiously enough,

1295
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:04,112
weren't being taken off kids
in the city of Flint,

1296
01:03:04,246 --> 01:03:07,113
but were being taken off of kids
out in the out-county area,

1297
01:03:07,249 --> 01:03:11,049
in the suburban communities.
And--

1298
01:03:11,186 --> 01:03:13,051
- I didn't think that's
what you were gonna say.

1299
01:03:13,188 --> 01:03:16,055
I thought you were gonna say
that it's all these black kids

1300
01:03:16,191 --> 01:03:18,056
in the inner-city schools
that had these guns.

1301
01:03:18,193 --> 01:03:20,559
- No, that's...

1302
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:25,565
We've never really had many
problems with guns in the city.

1303
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:28,067
Not to say that we haven't;
we've had some.

1304
01:03:28,203 --> 01:03:30,068
But that's never been
the biggest problem.

1305
01:03:30,205 --> 01:03:32,571
The biggest problem has been
the gun possession

1306
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:36,200
by these adolescents
in suburbia.

1307
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:38,711
- How'd you get a gun?

1308
01:03:38,847 --> 01:03:41,577
- I stole mine. I stole it
from a friend of mine.

1309
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:43,412
His dad owns a bunch of guns.

1310
01:03:43,552 --> 01:03:45,417
- What we're you doing
with the stolen guns?

1311
01:03:45,554 --> 01:03:47,419
- We went down to Detroit
and started selling them.

1312
01:03:47,556 --> 01:03:51,549
'Cause I can get, like, a buck
fifty a pop for a 9-millimetre.

1313
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:54,561
- Oh, really. Who were you trying
to sell them to?

1314
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:57,723
- Anybody that would really want
'em. Gangs and stuff like that.

1315
01:03:57,866 --> 01:04:01,029
- Gangs in the city of Detroit?
- Yeah.

1316
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,933
- Black?
- Uh, predominantly. Yeah.

1317
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:04,937
- Yeah. So now you're out now,
you're okay.

1318
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:06,939
- Yeah, I'm free now.
I'm completely clear.

1319
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:09,442
- You can keep selling guns.
- I can't keep selling guns.

1320
01:04:09,578 --> 01:04:11,375
It's getting too risky.
Everybody knows me up here.

1321
01:04:11,513 --> 01:04:14,380
People want guns, drugs or
alcohol, they come to my house

1322
01:04:14,516 --> 01:04:16,040
and that's just too much.

1323
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,016
- Yeah, too much hassle.
- Yeah.

1324
01:04:18,153 --> 01:04:24,217
- My favourite statistic in all
the research I did discovered

1325
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:28,456
that the murder rate had gone
down by 20%. The coverage -

1326
01:04:28,597 --> 01:04:32,055
that is, how many murders are
on the evening news -

1327
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:34,396
it went up by 600%.

1328
01:04:34,536 --> 01:04:39,064
- The American people are
conditioned by network TV,

1329
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,073
by local news,

1330
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,075
to believe that
their communities are

1331
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:46,079
much more dangerous
than they actually are.

1332
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,080
For example, here,
in this community,

1333
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:52,085
crime has decreased every year
for the past eight years.

1334
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,382
Yet, gun ownership,
particularly handgun ownership,

1335
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:56,388
is on the increase.

1336
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:59,085
- Crime rates have been
dropping, dropping, dropping.

1337
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:02,595
Fear of crime has been going
up, up, up.

1338
01:05:02,731 --> 01:05:05,097
How can that be possible?
It doesn't make any sense.

1339
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:08,601
But it makes perfect sense
when you see what we're hearing

1340
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:11,638
from politicians and seeing
in the news media.

1341
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:13,799
- So we're, uh, we're right here

1342
01:05:13,942 --> 01:05:16,433
on the corner of Florence
and Normandie.

1343
01:05:16,578 --> 01:05:18,443
It's kind of Ground Zero
for the L.A. riots.

1344
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:19,740
- Right.

1345
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:22,908
- You know, if a couple
of white guys

1346
01:05:23,051 --> 01:05:25,144
would go down and walk around
South Central,

1347
01:05:25,287 --> 01:05:26,185
they're gonna get killed.

1348
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:28,516
Which I can tell you
is a common perception.

1349
01:05:28,657 --> 01:05:31,057
The odds that something's
going to happen to us

1350
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:33,058
are really, really slight.

1351
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:35,060
Minuscule.
- Right. Okay.

1352
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:37,062
- But you know,
if you look up there,

1353
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:40,066
you get a different symbol
of the Hollywood sign.

1354
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:42,067
It means something
very different

1355
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:44,069
than the corner
of Florence and Normandie.

1356
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:46,071
For most Americans
and most of the world,

1357
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:49,075
it means glamour and Hollywood,
except that we can't see it.

1358
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:51,076
- I can't see the Hollywood sign.
Where is it?

1359
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:53,579
- Right. You can't see it because
of something that's probably...

1360
01:05:53,715 --> 01:05:55,580
much more dangerous for us
right now,

1361
01:05:55,717 --> 01:05:57,582
which is the stuff
we're breathing.

1362
01:05:57,719 --> 01:05:59,584
- The pollution that's blocking
the Hollywood sign,

1363
01:05:59,721 --> 01:06:01,279
we're breathing this.

1364
01:06:01,423 --> 01:06:04,085
That's far more dangerous than
all the other stuff the media's

1365
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:06,057
telling us to be afraid of.
- Right.

1366
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:08,925
- As we left the corner
of Florence and Normandie,

1367
01:06:09,064 --> 01:06:10,861
I noticed that a number
of helicopters

1368
01:06:10,999 --> 01:06:13,194
had appeared in the sky.

1369
01:06:13,335 --> 01:06:15,132
Within seconds, the news media

1370
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:17,135
started to arrive.
- So what's the story here?

1371
01:06:17,272 --> 01:06:19,638
- I'm waiting.
I thought you would know.

1372
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,640
- No, I don't know anything.

1373
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:24,541
- The Sergeant just told me
there's a guy with a gun.

1374
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,545
But they're not sure.
That's all they told me.

1375
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:28,809
Since there's no action,
I'm not getting my camera down.

1376
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:31,317
- I just happened to see the
chopper, going to another story.

1377
01:06:31,453 --> 01:06:33,819
- What story are you going to?
- It's a near-drowning.

1378
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:35,480
- It's a drowning?
- A near-drowning.

1379
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:37,489
- How about a story
about how you can't see

1380
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:39,560
the Hollywood Hills
because of the pollution?

1381
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:42,562
Could you maybe do a story
on that tonight?

1382
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:45,667
- Pollution, that's rather good.
I find that good.

1383
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:48,167
You can't see it. You can't see
anything around here.

1384
01:06:48,303 --> 01:06:51,170
- If you have to choose
between a guy with a gun

1385
01:06:51,306 --> 01:06:54,070
and a near-drowning of a baby -
you could only be one place--

1386
01:06:54,209 --> 01:06:55,972
- I go with the gun.
- You go with the gun, always.

1387
01:06:58,247 --> 01:07:00,078
Is it all over, here?
It's all over? All over?

1388
01:07:00,215 --> 01:07:02,080
- Not yet, not yet.
- Looks like it.

1389
01:07:02,217 --> 01:07:04,583
- Just wait for these sergeants
down here to come down,

1390
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,585
'cause they got all the details.

1391
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,587
- Okay. Hey, I was
just wondering -

1392
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:12,023
I just got here to L.A. today -
I can't see the Hollywood sign,

1393
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,025
down on the hills there,
down Normandie.

1394
01:07:14,162 --> 01:07:16,027
You can't see the sign
'cause of the pollution.

1395
01:07:16,164 --> 01:07:18,029
- Right.
- Is there anybody you can arrest

1396
01:07:18,166 --> 01:07:20,532
for polluting up the air?
- Absolutely not.

1397
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:22,534
- Nobody?
- No.

1398
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:24,070
- Why is that?

1399
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:27,908
Why is that, Sergeant?

1400
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:35,907
- He's fighting!

1401
01:07:36,051 --> 01:07:37,916
- For over a decade,

1402
01:07:38,053 --> 01:07:41,147
there has been one show
on American television

1403
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,724
that has consistently brought
black and white people together

1404
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:46,054
in an effort to reduce
our fears

1405
01:07:46,194 --> 01:07:49,061
and celebrate our diversity.

1406
01:07:49,197 --> 01:07:51,222
That show is Cops.

1407
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:56,833
I went to see a former
producer of "Cops"

1408
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:58,303
and executive producer

1409
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,271
of World's Wildest
Police Videos:

1410
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,070
Mr. Dick Herland.

1411
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:04,075
- Look "liberal" up
in the dictionary

1412
01:08:04,212 --> 01:08:06,077
and I think my picture's
in there somewhere,

1413
01:08:06,214 --> 01:08:11,015
- So then, you know, why not be
compelled to do, you know,

1414
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:16,022
a show that focuses on, you
know, what's causing the crime,

1415
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,524
as opposed to just chasing
the criminals down?

1416
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:21,026
- Because I think it's harder
to do that show.

1417
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:23,097
I don't know what
that show would be.

1418
01:08:23,231 --> 01:08:25,028
Anger does well, hate does
well, violence does well.

1419
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,533
Tolerance and understanding
and trying to learn to be

1420
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:30,604
a little different than you were
last year does less well.

1421
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:32,604
- Does less well in the ratings.
- Oh yeah.

1422
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:35,539
- Maybe because we,
in the television business,

1423
01:08:35,677 --> 01:08:39,545
because we tend to demonize
black and Hispanic people,

1424
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:41,546
then those watching it at home
are going:

1425
01:08:41,683 --> 01:08:43,548
"I don't want to help
those people.

1426
01:08:43,685 --> 01:08:45,550
I'm not going to do anything
to help them.

1427
01:08:45,687 --> 01:08:48,053
Because I hate them now,
because they may hurt me."

1428
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:51,057
You know what I'm saying?
- I know what you're saying,

1429
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:53,559
I'm not sure that's
what we're doing.

1430
01:08:53,695 --> 01:08:56,061
I'm not sure we're demonizing

1431
01:08:56,198 --> 01:09:00,567
black and Hispanic people, uh...
particularly.

1432
01:09:00,702 --> 01:09:03,068
I don't think we show
black and Hispanic people

1433
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:06,572
as being criminals.

1434
01:09:06,708 --> 01:09:08,972
I'd like to say not more often,

1435
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:11,079
but probably
they are more often.

1436
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:14,649
But I certainly don't think...
We're certainly not trying

1437
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:16,648
to demonize black
and Hispanic people.

1438
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:19,583
- We show them on the news,
we show them on TV,

1439
01:09:19,721 --> 01:09:22,087
as pretty scary people.

1440
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:24,954
- Yeah.

1441
01:09:25,093 --> 01:09:27,084
And I agree. I'd like
to see that reversed

1442
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:31,097
as much as possible. I...

1443
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:33,098
- Start tonight.
- Well, the thing is,

1444
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:35,100
I don't know how
to start tonight.

1445
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:37,102
I don't know how to tell
that story.

1446
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:39,104
If I was smart enough
to do that...

1447
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,607
- I'll pitch you one.
- Okay. All right.

1448
01:09:41,743 --> 01:09:44,109
- Um... um...

1449
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:46,578
Do a show called not Cops
but Corporate Cops.

1450
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:50,442
"Corporation man
Hey Corporate man

1451
01:09:50,585 --> 01:09:53,076
"We're coming out to get you
better run while you can

1452
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:56,515
"We're coming out to get you
better run while you can"

1453
01:09:56,658 --> 01:09:58,626
- Uh... I love the idea.

1454
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:02,127
I don't think it would make
very interesting reality TV.

1455
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:05,631
Unless we can get those people
to get in their SUVs

1456
01:10:05,767 --> 01:10:09,134
and drive really fast down
the road away from the police.

1457
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:11,364
- But I'm telling you,
everyone in America

1458
01:10:11,506 --> 01:10:13,371
who's got just your basic,
everyday job

1459
01:10:13,508 --> 01:10:15,976
is gonna love watching the boss

1460
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:18,079
being chased down the street
with his shirt off,

1461
01:10:18,213 --> 01:10:19,612
thrown to the ground

1462
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:22,615
and a knee to the neck. I tell
you, that is gonna get ratings.

1463
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:25,618
- Yeah, I'm with you. And if
I can find a police outfit

1464
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:29,588
that would prosecute corporate
criminals appropriately

1465
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:31,590
and would go after them
appropriately... In other words,

1466
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:34,594
what you do to a man who's
just stolen a lady's purse

1467
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,595
with $85 to it,

1468
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:40,099
than you need to do
an appropriate response

1469
01:10:40,235 --> 01:10:44,103
to a man who has just stolen $85
million from indigent people,

1470
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:46,104
then, boy, we're gonna be
out there filming that.

1471
01:10:46,241 --> 01:10:49,108
But as a matter of fact,
when police go after the guy

1472
01:10:49,244 --> 01:10:51,109
who's just stolen $85 million,

1473
01:10:51,246 --> 01:10:54,113
they treat him like he was
a member of the city council -

1474
01:10:54,249 --> 01:10:57,616
as he may or may not be - and
it's not exciting television.

1475
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:00,119
If you could get that guy
to take his shirt off...

1476
01:11:00,255 --> 01:11:02,120
- Right.

1477
01:11:02,257 --> 01:11:04,122
- Yeah, and throw his cellular
phone at the police

1478
01:11:04,259 --> 01:11:06,124
as they come through the door,

1479
01:11:06,261 --> 01:11:09,253
try to jump out that window,
then we'd have a show.

1480
01:11:09,397 --> 01:11:12,059
- You watch violence on TV
in a place like Canada

1481
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,065
and you know it's not happening
next door.

1482
01:11:14,202 --> 01:11:18,070
You watch it here, and you know
it is happening next door.

1483
01:11:18,206 --> 01:11:20,071
- Right.
- I think that's...

1484
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:22,073
I don't know what
the difference is,

1485
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:24,075
but there's a big difference.
- Yeah, but why isn't...

1486
01:11:24,212 --> 01:11:26,077
Why isn't it happening
in Canada?

1487
01:11:26,214 --> 01:11:29,081
Why aren't there, you know,
10,000 murders a year?

1488
01:11:29,217 --> 01:11:32,084
- I don't know, but I want
to go to Canada to retire,

1489
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:35,087
or something, 'cause it sounds
like where we want to be.

1490
01:11:35,223 --> 01:11:38,090
I'd like to find out what that
difference is. Wouldn't you?

1491
01:11:38,226 --> 01:11:40,126
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm trying
to find out.

1492
01:11:46,334 --> 01:11:49,098
Where are you supposed
to be right now?

1493
01:11:49,237 --> 01:11:51,102
- School.
- School.

1494
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:52,706
- School.

1495
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:54,706
- Aren't you worried about
what you're not learning?

1496
01:11:54,843 --> 01:11:56,708
- Nah, I'm mostly helping
everybody else in the class.

1497
01:11:56,845 --> 01:12:00,042
Then I barely get to do my work.
- How about you? You're not

1498
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:03,208
worried about your education?
- Well, I've got the textbook.

1499
01:12:03,351 --> 01:12:05,876
- Why do you think
we have so many, uh...

1500
01:12:06,021 --> 01:12:08,216
gun murders in America?
- Uh...

1501
01:12:08,356 --> 01:12:11,553
I have no idea. People must hate
each other or something.

1502
01:12:11,693 --> 01:12:13,558
- Oh, you mean Canadians don't
hate each other?

1503
01:12:13,695 --> 01:12:16,562
- Well, we do but we don't go to
the point of shooting somebody

1504
01:12:16,698 --> 01:12:19,565
just to get revenge.
- What do you do?

1505
01:12:19,701 --> 01:12:22,067
- I don't know.
Tease them, maybe.

1506
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:25,537
Make fun of them, ridicule them.
- Throw eggs at them.

1507
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:28,575
- How many gun murders
in Sarnia this year?

1508
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:30,575
- None.
- Last year?

1509
01:12:30,712 --> 01:12:32,577
- I believe we had one,
at the time.

1510
01:12:32,714 --> 01:12:34,579
- The year before that?

1511
01:12:34,716 --> 01:12:37,082
- I can't recall what we had
in the way of--

1512
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:39,084
- Maybe one in the last
three years?

1513
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,086
- Probably, yes.
- Mm-hm.

1514
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:44,386
- Very low. Very low
for this city.

1515
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,391
- Well, of course,
there's no murders here

1516
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:48,393
because there's only
70,000 people

1517
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:51,226
and it's the kissing
capital of the world.

1518
01:12:51,366 --> 01:12:53,698
So I went down the river
to another Canadian city

1519
01:12:53,835 --> 01:12:55,700
that was five times
as large as Sarnia:

1520
01:12:55,837 --> 01:12:59,204
Windsor, Ontario, just across
the river from Detroit.

1521
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:03,141
I was sure there'd be
more murders in Windsor.

1522
01:13:03,278 --> 01:13:06,145
Ever hear of anyone being shot
by a gun in Windsor?

1523
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:08,306
- No. No.

1524
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,247
- You remember any murders here?

1525
01:13:10,385 --> 01:13:13,548
- Uh, there was one
a long time ago. Probably--

1526
01:13:13,688 --> 01:13:17,055
- How long ago?
- Oh...

1527
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:19,057
- In your lifetime?
- In my lifetime,

1528
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:22,652
probably around 15, 20 years
ago, there was one murder.

1529
01:13:22,797 --> 01:13:24,765
- In fact, this Windsor
policeman told me

1530
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,265
that the only gun murder

1531
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:28,562
he could recall in Windsor
in the last three years

1532
01:13:28,703 --> 01:13:31,069
was committed by a guy
from Detroit,

1533
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:33,674
who had a stolen gun
from Minnesota.

1534
01:13:33,808 --> 01:13:37,608
With nearly 400,000 people
in the Windsor area,

1535
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:42,012
there were simply no Canadians
shooting other Canadians.

1536
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:43,640
I thought it might be time

1537
01:13:43,785 --> 01:13:47,653
for some fun facts
about Canada.

1538
01:13:47,789 --> 01:13:50,019
I hit the streets of New York
to find out what

1539
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:52,524
the average American thought
about our friendly neighbour

1540
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:54,094
to the north.

1541
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:59,531
- Canadians don't watch as much
violent movies as Americans do.

1542
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:05,599
- That's wrong.

1543
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:07,833
Hordes of young boys,
all throughout Canada,

1544
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:10,501
eagerly await the next
Hollywood bloodbath.

1545
01:14:10,645 --> 01:14:13,045
- Then one of the guy gets
his leg taken off.

1546
01:14:13,181 --> 01:14:16,048
- Oh, wow!
- And there was a lot of girls,

1547
01:14:16,184 --> 01:14:19,642
and naked at one point.
- I like that stuff.

1548
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:22,814
- What movie did you see tonight?
- Sixth Day.

1549
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:25,859
- With Arnold Schwarzenegger?
- Yeah.

1550
01:14:25,994 --> 01:14:27,859
- Did it make you want
to come out here

1551
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:29,861
and play this shoot-'em-up game?

1552
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:32,193
- Well... yeah.

1553
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:35,064
- There's no poverty in Canada
like there is here...

1554
01:14:35,203 --> 01:14:37,171
in the States.

1555
01:14:37,305 --> 01:14:38,670
- Wrong again.

1556
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:40,708
Mayor Mike Bradley
Sarnia, Ontario, Canada

1557
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:42,504
- Actually, we've also had
a much higher unemployment rate.

1558
01:14:42,577 --> 01:14:45,205
When Michigan rate was running at 4%,
we were still at 8-9%,

1559
01:14:45,313 --> 01:14:47,304
We seem to have an institutional
unemployment rate.

1560
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:49,679
- I think there'd mostly be
white people in Canada.

1561
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:52,685
- Hmm... that's strange,
'cause when I'm in Canada,

1562
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:55,346
I see black people everywhere.

1563
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:57,355
And yellow people,
and brown people...

1564
01:14:57,492 --> 01:14:59,084
and 13% of the country is
non-white.

1565
01:14:59,227 --> 01:15:01,354
So the Canadians are

1566
01:15:01,496 --> 01:15:04,693
pretty much just like us.
And the reason that they have
(Toronto, Canada)

1567
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:08,098
so few murders has to be
because they've got

1568
01:15:08,236 --> 01:15:10,534
so few guns.

1569
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:17,440
What kind of guns do you own?
- Uh, I hunt.

1570
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:20,047
I own rifles and shotguns,
and I own pistols.

1571
01:15:20,181 --> 01:15:23,548
- Mm-hm. So how many guns total?
- Uh... Probably about seven.

1572
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:25,118
- Seven guns?
- Yeah.

1573
01:15:25,253 --> 01:15:27,050
- Do you have a gun?
- I have a few.

1574
01:15:27,188 --> 01:15:30,055
- How many guns do you have?
- Half a dozen.

1575
01:15:30,191 --> 01:15:33,558
- You could name how many people
that own guns, that you know?

1576
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:36,391
Two, three, a dozen?
- More than that.

1577
01:15:36,531 --> 01:15:39,091
- There's a tremendous
amount of gun ownership.

1578
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:41,065
We're a large country
geographically.

1579
01:15:41,202 --> 01:15:43,534
We grew up with hunting and
fishing being a tradition.

1580
01:15:43,671 --> 01:15:46,071
- In Canada, with a population
of just around 30 million -

1581
01:15:46,207 --> 01:15:48,072
there's about
10 million families -

1582
01:15:48,209 --> 01:15:50,074
and the best estimate is
somewhere in the region

1583
01:15:50,211 --> 01:15:51,974
of seven-million guns.

1584
01:15:52,113 --> 01:15:53,410
- Wow!

1585
01:15:53,548 --> 01:15:55,778
Canada was one gun-loving,

1586
01:15:55,917 --> 01:15:58,750
gun-toting, gun-crazy country!

1587
01:16:00,388 --> 01:16:03,289
Where can you get a gun?
- Uptown, any time I want.

1588
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:04,653
- I see you're a Glock owner.

1589
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:07,591
Where can I get a Glock
in Canada?

1590
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:10,095
- Most gun stores'll sell 'em
to you

1591
01:16:10,231 --> 01:16:12,028
if you have the proper
permits and stuff.

1592
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:14,158
- In fact, despite all
their tough gun laws,

1593
01:16:14,302 --> 01:16:16,065
take a look at what I,

1594
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:18,798
a foreign citizen,
was able to do

1595
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:20,737
at the local Canadian Wal-Mart.

1596
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:23,537
Where's the ammunition at?
- Where's the ammunition?

1597
01:16:23,678 --> 01:16:25,077
- Yeah.
- Back here.

1598
01:16:28,716 --> 01:16:31,583
What kind are you looking for?
- You know, like, bullets.

1599
01:16:33,688 --> 01:16:35,349
That's right.

1600
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:38,357
I could buy as much live
ammunition as I wanted to

1601
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:40,222
in Canada.
You take American?

1602
01:16:40,361 --> 01:16:42,090
Do you lock your doors?

1603
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:44,721
- No.
- Are you afraid of anything?

1604
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:46,767
Sarnia, Canada

1605
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:50,304
- Nah, not really, no.
- Do you lock your doors
at night?

1606
01:16:50,438 --> 01:16:52,303
- No.
- You don't lock your doors?

1607
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,067
- No.
- Well, what do you...

1608
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:56,473
Are you afraid of anything?
- Not really.

1609
01:16:56,611 --> 01:17:00,069
- Have you ever been broken into?
- Yes, I have. Yeah.

1610
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:02,581
- What happened?
- They broke into my home.

1611
01:17:02,717 --> 01:17:04,582
I wasn't there. They broke in,

1612
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:07,279
they stole some booze
and cigarettes and they left.

1613
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:09,686
So I figure it must've been
some teenagers

1614
01:17:09,824 --> 01:17:13,590
out to have a little bit of fun.
That's all they took, though.

1615
01:17:13,728 --> 01:17:15,457
Just some booze
and some cigarettes.

1616
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:17,462
- Have you ever been
a victim of crime?

1617
01:17:17,599 --> 01:17:19,533
- Yes.
- What kind of crime?

1618
01:17:19,667 --> 01:17:22,033
- Uh, I've had people walk in
while I've been sleeping

1619
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:25,037
and vandalize my home
and steal from me.

1620
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:28,040
- And that didn't want to make
you lock your doors at night?

1621
01:17:28,176 --> 01:17:30,667
- No. No.

1622
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:33,474
- As an American with
three locks on his doors,

1623
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:35,674
I found this all
a bit confusing.

1624
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:38,251
Even here, in Toronto,
a city of millions,

1625
01:17:38,386 --> 01:17:39,853
people just didn't lock
their doors.

1626
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:44,053
So you don't lock your doors but
we, Americans, do. Why is that?

1627
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:46,820
- You must be afraid
of your neighbour.

1628
01:17:46,961 --> 01:17:49,054
- Do you ever leave your doors
unlocked at home?

1629
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:51,563
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you do?

1630
01:17:51,699 --> 01:17:53,564
Where do you live?
- Right around here.

1631
01:17:53,701 --> 01:17:55,066
- Toronto?
- Around here.

1632
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:56,864
- You leave your doors unlocked?
- Yeah.

1633
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:58,870
- You'd think, as Americans,

1634
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:02,568
that the lock is keeping people
out of your place.

1635
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:06,077
We, as Canadians,
see it more as, uh...

1636
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:09,581
when we lock the door, we're
imprisoning ourselves inside.

1637
01:18:09,717 --> 01:18:11,514
- You don't want to do that.

1638
01:18:11,653 --> 01:18:13,518
- Not really, no.

1639
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:17,386
We don't want to... No.

1640
01:18:17,525 --> 01:18:21,017
- I decided to go unannounced
to a neighbourhood in Toronto

1641
01:18:21,162 --> 01:18:24,529
to see if this unlocked-door
thing was true.

1642
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:26,896
Oh, hi. I'm sorry.
Just checking.

1643
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:33,732
[ dog barking ]
Oh, hello!

1644
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:42,047
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

1645
01:18:42,183 --> 01:18:44,048
- Nobody locks their doors.

1646
01:18:44,185 --> 01:18:46,050
Nobody locks their doors
in this town.

1647
01:18:46,187 --> 01:18:48,985
- You want to lock?
- No, no, no.

1648
01:18:49,123 --> 01:18:51,057
Do you like living here?
- I like it very much.

1649
01:18:51,192 --> 01:18:53,490
- Yeah? And the T-shirt?
- The T-shirt too.

1650
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:55,687
- This door was wide open.
And you're not afraid?

1651
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:58,128
- Should I be afraid?
- I don't know. You live here.

1652
01:18:58,266 --> 01:19:00,325
- I don't think I'm afraid.
- You're not, are you?

1653
01:19:00,468 --> 01:19:02,333
Thank you very much.
- All right. No problem.

1654
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:04,335
- I'm sorry about the intrusion.
- No, no problem.

1655
01:19:04,472 --> 01:19:06,838
- Thank you for not shooting me.
- No problem at all.

1656
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:08,340
- Bye-bye.
- Okay.

1657
01:19:08,476 --> 01:19:09,534
- As an American,

1658
01:19:09,677 --> 01:19:11,975
I gotta say this all
seemed kind of strange.

1659
01:19:12,113 --> 01:19:13,876
Until I looked up at the TV

1660
01:19:14,015 --> 01:19:16,006
in the bar and noticed
what they watched

1661
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:17,082
for their evening news.

1662
01:19:17,218 --> 01:19:19,812
- They're friends of ours.

1663
01:19:19,954 --> 01:19:23,082
We'll certainly listen to them
courteously and carefully,

1664
01:19:23,224 --> 01:19:26,887
but you don't just make war
just 'cause someone says so.

1665
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:30,930
- The Canadians weren't being
pumped full of fear.

1666
01:19:31,065 --> 01:19:33,192
And their politicians seemed
to talk kind of funny.

1667
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:35,359
Mayor Mike Bradley
Sarnia, Canada

1668
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:37,768
- ...making sure they have good daycare,
assistance for their parents

1669
01:19:37,872 --> 01:19:40,102
when they're elderly and need
to be in an old-age home,

1670
01:19:40,241 --> 01:19:41,265
that they have proper
health care that insures

1671
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:43,741
that they won't lose
their business or their house

1672
01:19:43,878 --> 01:19:45,641
because they can't
afford their medical bills.

1673
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:47,577
That's how you build
a good society.

1674
01:19:47,715 --> 01:19:50,081
No one wins unless everyone
wins. And you don't win

1675
01:19:50,218 --> 01:19:52,345
by beating up on people
who can't defend themselves.

1676
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:53,852
And that's been the approach,
unfortunately,

1677
01:19:53,988 --> 01:19:56,354
that's been spreading with some
of the right-wing governments

1678
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:58,118
across North America.
They pick onto people

1679
01:19:58,259 --> 01:20:00,386
that can't defend
themselves and at the same time,

1680
01:20:00,528 --> 01:20:02,155
they're turning around and
giving financial support

1681
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:05,266
and tax breaks and tax benefits
to people that don't need them.

1682
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,631
- Where are the indigents in
the city? Where do they live?

1683
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:11,568
- Uh... indigent... uh...

1684
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:14,072
- You act like you've never heard
the word before.

1685
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:16,073
- There's... We don't have that
problem here, really. It's...

1686
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:17,575
- So I asked him,

1687
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:20,078
"Could you at least take me
to a Canadian slum,"

1688
01:20:20,214 --> 01:20:21,681
and well...

1689
01:20:21,816 --> 01:20:24,979
this is what a ghetto
looks like in Canada.

1690
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:28,247
Is this the same mentality that
says, with Canadians, if someone

1691
01:20:28,389 --> 01:20:31,825
gets sick, they should actually
be able to have health care?

1692
01:20:31,959 --> 01:20:33,824
- Yeah.
- Oh, definitely.

1693
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:36,088
- Yeah.
- Yup.

1694
01:20:36,230 --> 01:20:37,595
- Why?

1695
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:39,529
- Because!

1696
01:20:39,667 --> 01:20:41,532
- Human rights. Everyone's got
the right to live.

1697
01:20:41,669 --> 01:20:43,534
- You just came out of
the emergency room?

1698
01:20:43,671 --> 01:20:45,104
- Yes, I did.

1699
01:20:45,239 --> 01:20:47,605
- How much did you have to pay
for your treatment?

1700
01:20:47,742 --> 01:20:49,607
- The bill is covered
by our hospital plan.

1701
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:51,609
- You're telling me you didn't
have to pay anything?

1702
01:20:51,746 --> 01:20:53,236
- No, I don't.

1703
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:55,747
- I have family that lives
in the States.

1704
01:20:55,883 --> 01:20:58,249
They used to live in Canada
and moved over there.

1705
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:01,617
And it's so different.
- They get afraid more easily.

1706
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:03,621
- Oh, yeah.

1707
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:05,623
Yeah, very much so.

1708
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:09,628
'Cause everybody reacts
over there just like that.

1709
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:12,562
They don't stop and think.

1710
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:17,069
First reaction is pull the gun
out. "You're on my property."

1711
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:20,572
You know, like...

1712
01:21:20,708 --> 01:21:23,871
I don't know. It's just
different over here.

1713
01:21:24,011 --> 01:21:25,876
- Where do you live?
- Detroit.
(Windsor, Canada)

1714
01:21:26,013 --> 01:21:27,571
- Come over to Canada here
for the night?

1715
01:21:27,715 --> 01:21:29,080
- Right.

1716
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:32,311
- People are more open-minded
here, a bit more welcoming.

1717
01:21:32,453 --> 01:21:35,081
- Feel any difference when
you cross over to this country?

1718
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,248
Be honest, now, come on.
- It's a lot lighter.

1719
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:39,257
- The segregation over there
is definitely much more--

1720
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:41,259
- In the United States.
- ...more intensified

1721
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:43,261
in the States, yeah.
- Yeah.

1722
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:45,457
- So you can... You can feel it.

1723
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,761
- Almost like they just
let you be.

1724
01:21:47,902 --> 01:21:49,995
- That's Canada for you.

1725
01:21:50,138 --> 01:21:52,106
- Every time I turn on the TV
in the States,

1726
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:55,607
it's always about a murder here,
a gunfight, hostile position...

1727
01:21:55,743 --> 01:21:59,110
- I just think the States, their
view of things is fighting.

1728
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:01,112
That's how they resolve
everything.

1729
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:04,116
If there's... there's something
going on in another country,

1730
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:06,117
they send people over
to fight it and...

1731
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:08,620
- They are the most powerful
country in the world, though.

1732
01:22:08,756 --> 01:22:10,553
- Canada's more just, like,
"Let's negotiate,

1733
01:22:10,691 --> 01:22:13,057
let's work something out."
Where the States is,

1734
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:15,594
"We'll kill you and that'll be
the end of that."

1735
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:20,565
- Um, if guns were...
If more guns made people safer,

1736
01:22:20,701 --> 01:22:23,761
then America would be one of the
safest countries in the world.

1737
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:25,805
It isn't. It's the opposite.

1738
01:23:10,451 --> 01:23:12,419
- I heard that 911 call,
you know, on TV someplace.

1739
01:23:12,553 --> 01:23:14,418
It was horrible. It was just...

1740
01:23:14,555 --> 01:23:16,284
- 'Cause he kept asking,
"Where's the shooter?"

1741
01:23:16,424 --> 01:23:18,415
She said, "He's gone.
I need some help."

1742
01:23:18,559 --> 01:23:19,958
- The little girl was
in there too?

1743
01:23:20,094 --> 01:23:23,029
- She was on the floor, yes.

1744
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:25,064
- And the police and
the medics came, or...

1745
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:27,064
- By the time the medics were
here...

1746
01:23:27,201 --> 01:23:30,068
The medics had just come in
and I remember him stepping in

1747
01:23:30,204 --> 01:23:33,071
and taking over the room.
He said, "You have to leave."

1748
01:23:33,207 --> 01:23:35,072
- All right.
- And then when the meds come in,

1749
01:23:35,209 --> 01:23:37,575
when the police come in,
you're no longer in control.

1750
01:23:37,712 --> 01:23:40,579
They take over the building.
- Was she still alive then?

1751
01:23:40,715 --> 01:23:42,979
- Her lips had become
totally blue.

1752
01:23:45,586 --> 01:23:47,247
- Back in my hometown
of Flint, Michigan,

1753
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:51,052
a six-year-old first-grade boy,
at Buell Elementary,

1754
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:53,592
had found a gun
at his uncle's house,

1755
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:57,061
where he was staying because
his mother was being evicted.

1756
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:01,066
He brought the gun to school
and shot another first-grader,

1757
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:04,228
six-year-old Kayla Rolland.

1758
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:06,602
With one bullet that passed
through her body,

1759
01:24:06,741 --> 01:24:09,369
she fell to the floor
and laid there dying

1760
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:12,968
while her teacher called 911
for help.

1761
01:24:13,114 --> 01:24:14,945
No one knew why the little boy

1762
01:24:15,082 --> 01:24:16,640
wanted to shoot
the little girl.

1763
01:24:16,784 --> 01:24:18,979
As if the city
had not been through

1764
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,144
enough horror and tragedy

1765
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:22,654
in the past two decades,
it was now home

1766
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:25,918
to a new record: the youngest
school shooting ever

1767
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:27,925
in the United States.

1768
01:24:28,062 --> 01:24:30,724
On the morning of the shooting,

1769
01:24:30,865 --> 01:24:34,824
it only took the helicopters
and satellite trucks

1770
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:36,402
a half-hour to show up.

1771
01:24:36,537 --> 01:24:38,095
- They check in the truck.

1772
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:41,174
You know, we're doing one
in 30 minutes again.

1773
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:43,174
- This evening,
about seven o'clock,

1774
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:46,041
will be a public memorial
service. Hundreds of people

1775
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:49,513
will mourn the loss of little
Kayla, a tiny little girl

1776
01:24:49,650 --> 01:24:51,675
who loved pizza, teddy bears,

1777
01:24:51,819 --> 01:24:54,913
and who was taken away from us
much too soon. Gina?

1778
01:24:55,056 --> 01:24:56,921
- Good morning, Christine.
The funeral home now passing out

1779
01:24:57,058 --> 01:24:59,083
tens of thousands
of these pink ribbons

1780
01:24:59,226 --> 01:25:01,592
to support the young
girl's family.

1781
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:04,095
Today will be an emotional day
and has been already,

1782
01:25:04,231 --> 01:25:06,131
remembering little Kayla.

1783
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:08,132
Jeff Ross, Fox-2 News.

1784
01:25:10,671 --> 01:25:12,070
- Nice job.

1785
01:25:14,175 --> 01:25:16,541
- Yeah, Michelle, we're having
technical problems, okay?

1786
01:25:16,677 --> 01:25:19,703
Well, don't talk to me about it,
call our sat truck.

1787
01:25:19,847 --> 01:25:21,712
I need a haircut, man.

1788
01:25:21,849 --> 01:25:25,046
I'm a pig. A rug.

1789
01:25:25,186 --> 01:25:26,585
Here we go.

1790
01:25:31,692 --> 01:25:33,557
Some too choked up
even to speak about it.

1791
01:25:33,694 --> 01:25:35,559
There's a memorial service
scheduled here

1792
01:25:35,696 --> 01:25:37,561
for seven o'clock tonight.

1793
01:25:37,698 --> 01:25:39,563
We're live in Flint, Michigan,
this afternoon.

1794
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:41,600
Jeff Ross, Q-13 Reports.

1795
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:47,834
Thank you.
- Thank you.

1796
01:25:47,908 --> 01:25:49,876
- Want some hairspray?

1797
01:25:49,944 --> 01:25:51,912
- I kind of need it, don't I?
- Yeah, you do,

1798
01:25:51,979 --> 01:25:53,003
- I got some...

1799
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:55,139
- I have some. I just didn't put
it in. I didn't have a chance.

1800
01:25:55,216 --> 01:25:56,911
I have hurricane-proof hairspray.

1801
01:25:56,984 --> 01:26:01,318
This man prayed for Kayla
then let the balloon go.

1802
01:26:01,455 --> 01:26:02,979
I say we have
the colour picture,

1803
01:26:03,124 --> 01:26:04,182
not the black-and-white.

1804
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:06,190
Plenty of media here
that covered Columbine.

1805
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:08,591
You know, there are
some networks, especially,

1806
01:26:08,729 --> 01:26:11,527
that go from, unfortunately,
tragedy to tragedy.

1807
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:17,036
And, uh, I feel bad for them.
Because that's all they see...

1808
01:26:17,171 --> 01:26:19,162
The tragedies.

1809
01:26:19,306 --> 01:26:22,400
We're just trying
to crunch right now

1810
01:26:22,543 --> 01:26:24,534
for the five and the six.

1811
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:28,740
Today, we're feeding
CNN and Fox, so...

1812
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:33,047
- The national media had never
visited Buell Elementary,

1813
01:26:33,187 --> 01:26:36,054
or the Beecher school district
in which it sat,

1814
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:38,556
or this part of Flint
ever before.

1815
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:42,060
And few, if any, of these
reporters bothered to visit it

1816
01:26:42,196 --> 01:26:44,061
even when they were here now.

1817
01:26:44,198 --> 01:26:47,565
If they had ventured just
a block away from the school

1818
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:49,567
or the funeral home,
they might have seen

1819
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:52,070
a different kind of tragedy
that, perhaps, would contain

1820
01:26:52,206 --> 01:26:55,767
some answers as to why
this little girl was dead.

1821
01:26:57,745 --> 01:27:00,077
For over 20 years,
this impoverished area,

1822
01:27:00,214 --> 01:27:02,205
in the hometown

1823
01:27:02,349 --> 01:27:04,214
of the world's
largest corporation,

1824
01:27:04,351 --> 01:27:06,945
had been ignored as completely
as it had been destroyed.

1825
01:27:07,088 --> 01:27:10,421
With 87% of the students
living below

1826
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:12,423
the official poverty line,

1827
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:16,257
Buell and Beecher, and Flint,
did not fit into

1828
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:18,558
the accepted and widely
circulated story line

1829
01:27:18,699 --> 01:27:21,293
put forth by
the nation's media.

1830
01:27:21,435 --> 01:27:25,633
That being the one
about America

1831
01:27:25,773 --> 01:27:27,673
and its invincible economy.

1832
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:35,480
The number-one cause of death
among young people

1833
01:27:35,616 --> 01:27:38,813
in this part of Flint was
homicide. The football field,

1834
01:27:38,953 --> 01:27:42,150
at Flint-Beecher, was sponsored
by a funeral home.

1835
01:27:42,289 --> 01:27:45,918
The kids at Beecher have won

1836
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:48,028
13 state track championships,

1837
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:50,027
but they've never had

1838
01:27:50,164 --> 01:27:52,530
a home track meet.

1839
01:27:52,666 --> 01:27:54,566
Because around
the football field,

1840
01:27:54,702 --> 01:27:56,533
all they have is
this dirt ring.

1841
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:03,267
Years ago, someone here
named the streets,

1842
01:28:03,410 --> 01:28:06,675
in this part of town, after
all the Ivy League schools,

1843
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:10,113
as if they had dreamed
of better days

1844
01:28:10,251 --> 01:28:12,549
and something greater
for themselves.

1845
01:28:19,493 --> 01:28:22,860
- The children are doing well.

1846
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:25,022
The faculty and staff
are doing well.

1847
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:27,031
But we don't forget.

1848
01:28:27,168 --> 01:28:29,966
We don't forget.

1849
01:28:30,104 --> 01:28:32,470
Just don't want this happening
to anybody else, you know?

1850
01:28:32,606 --> 01:28:35,040
It's...
[ She sighs ]

1851
01:28:35,176 --> 01:28:37,041
- I know.

1852
01:28:37,178 --> 01:28:41,046
I know. I don't want it to
happen to anybody else either.

1853
01:28:41,182 --> 01:28:45,551
- Hmm...
- It's okay. It's okay.

1854
01:28:45,686 --> 01:28:47,313
It's okay.

1855
01:28:47,688 --> 01:28:49,087
It's okay.

1856
01:28:53,694 --> 01:28:56,094
I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

1857
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:02,567
[ Charlton Heston ]:
...from my cold, dead hands!

1858
01:29:02,703 --> 01:29:05,570
[ cheering ]
- Just as he did

1859
01:29:05,706 --> 01:29:08,937
after the Columbine shooting,
Charlton Heston showed up

1860
01:29:09,076 --> 01:29:11,840
in Flint to have
a big pro-gun rally.

1861
01:29:11,979 --> 01:29:13,844
- Freedom has never seen

1862
01:29:13,981 --> 01:29:18,077
greater peril nor needed
you more urgently

1863
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:20,346
to come to her defence than now.

1864
01:29:20,487 --> 01:29:22,079
- Before he came to Flint,
Heston was interviewed

1865
01:29:22,223 --> 01:29:25,522
by the Georgetown Hoya
about Kayla's death,

1866
01:29:25,659 --> 01:29:28,093
and even his own NRA website
talked about it.

1867
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:31,255
- We wanted to let the NRA know
that we haven't forgotten

1868
01:29:31,398 --> 01:29:32,660
about Kayla Rolland.

1869
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:35,268
How could they come here?
To me, it's like they're rubbing

1870
01:29:35,402 --> 01:29:37,427
our nose in it. I was shocked

1871
01:29:37,571 --> 01:29:39,266
and appalled that
they would come here.

1872
01:29:39,406 --> 01:29:42,671
- Heston was asked by a local
reporter why he came to Flint

1873
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:45,176
after the tragedy at Buell,

1874
01:29:45,312 --> 01:29:47,177
and what did the NRA
have to say

1875
01:29:47,314 --> 01:29:49,339
about six-year-olds using guns.

1876
01:29:49,483 --> 01:29:54,352
- We spend $20 million every year

1877
01:29:54,488 --> 01:29:57,616
and then we teach you...
to five and six-year-olds,

1878
01:29:57,758 --> 01:30:00,625
we say, "If you see a gun,
don't touch it,

1879
01:30:00,761 --> 01:30:03,127
leave the room, call an adult."

1880
01:30:03,264 --> 01:30:05,789
- And then Moses himself
showed up.

1881
01:30:05,933 --> 01:30:07,798
- Right here in the city
of Flint?

1882
01:30:07,935 --> 01:30:09,800
- Right here in Flint.

1883
01:30:09,937 --> 01:30:11,837
- Were there people that wanted
you to try this child,

1884
01:30:11,939 --> 01:30:13,907
Arthur Busch
County Prosecutor, Flint, Michigan

1885
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:17,067
or even try him as an adult?
- Oh... Oh, yeah.

1886
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:21,079
There were people from all over
America that wrote and called

1887
01:30:21,215 --> 01:30:25,584
and sent mail and...
It was amazing to me, um...

1888
01:30:25,719 --> 01:30:28,586
groups that were affiliated
with the NRA -

1889
01:30:28,722 --> 01:30:32,590
groups, you know, people
that I call "gun nuts" -

1890
01:30:32,726 --> 01:30:35,593
writing me and telling me
what a horrible thing it was

1891
01:30:35,729 --> 01:30:40,098
that I had admonished homeowners
in our country

1892
01:30:40,234 --> 01:30:44,102
to be careful about bringing
weapons into their home.

1893
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:47,605
They wanted this little boy
hung from the highest tree.

1894
01:30:47,741 --> 01:30:50,608
I mean, there was such
an undercurrent of racism

1895
01:30:50,744 --> 01:30:53,212
and hate and anger.

1896
01:30:53,314 --> 01:30:55,043
It was ugly.

1897
01:30:57,451 --> 01:30:58,975
- That's a picture that
the little boy that was involved

1898
01:30:59,186 --> 01:31:00,448
in the Buell-school shooting...

1899
01:31:00,587 --> 01:31:02,612
Once he was brought back here
to our office,

1900
01:31:02,756 --> 01:31:05,122
about 15 minutes after
the shooting took place,

1901
01:31:05,259 --> 01:31:07,727
I gave him some crayons to kind
of occupy him a little bit.

1902
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:09,729
Michael Caldwell
Police Detective

1903
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:11,697
He came over and drew
that picture for me.

1904
01:31:11,765 --> 01:31:13,892
Because at the time, I had
pictures right behind my desk

1905
01:31:14,034 --> 01:31:16,901
that my children had drew for me
and he wanted to draw me one.

1906
01:31:17,037 --> 01:31:20,438
- This is what he drew for you.
What did he say this was?

1907
01:31:20,574 --> 01:31:21,768
- That's him at his house.

1908
01:31:21,909 --> 01:31:23,706
- That's him at his house,
right here.

1909
01:31:23,844 --> 01:31:28,076
And why did you decide
to hang on to it?

1910
01:31:28,215 --> 01:31:31,082
- Because of the gravity of the
situation and what had occurred

1911
01:31:31,218 --> 01:31:33,584
and he asked me to hang that
behind my desk,

1912
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:36,622
so I put it in a frame
and that's where it'll stay.

1913
01:31:38,726 --> 01:31:42,093
- Tamarla Owens was the mother
of the six-year-old boy.

1914
01:31:42,229 --> 01:31:43,628
In order to get food stamps and
health care for her children,

1915
01:31:46,934 --> 01:31:49,095
Tamarla was forced to work as
part of the state of Michigan's

1916
01:31:49,236 --> 01:31:51,568
Welfare-to-Work Program.

1917
01:31:51,705 --> 01:31:53,764
This program was so successful

1918
01:31:53,907 --> 01:31:55,602
in tossing poor people
off welfare

1919
01:31:55,743 --> 01:31:57,176
that it's founder,

1920
01:31:57,311 --> 01:31:59,176
Gerald Miller, was soon hired

1921
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:02,339
by the number-one firm in the
country that states turned to

1922
01:32:02,483 --> 01:32:06,783
to privatize
their welfare systems.

1923
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:10,686
That firm was Lockheed Martin.
With the cold war over

1924
01:32:10,824 --> 01:32:13,292
and no enemy left
to frighten the public,

1925
01:32:13,427 --> 01:32:15,292
Lockheed had found
the perfect way to diversify

1926
01:32:15,429 --> 01:32:17,056
and the perfect way

1927
01:32:17,197 --> 01:32:19,062
to profit from people's fears,

1928
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:21,064
with an enemy
much closer to home:

1929
01:32:21,201 --> 01:32:23,601
poor black mothers

1930
01:32:23,737 --> 01:32:25,398
like Tamarla Owens.

1931
01:32:25,539 --> 01:32:28,508
- We've got a one-parent family and
the mother's travelling 60 miles.

1932
01:32:28,609 --> 01:32:31,169
Sheriff Robert Pickell
Flint, Michigan

1933
01:32:31,278 --> 01:32:33,473
An hour, an hour and a half
away to go to work

1934
01:32:33,547 --> 01:32:35,538
an hour, an hour and a half
to come home.

1935
01:32:35,616 --> 01:32:37,914
How does that help a community?
But that's part of the state...

1936
01:32:38,052 --> 01:32:39,952
you know, making parents
responsible, making them work--

1937
01:32:40,087 --> 01:32:41,987
- Welfare to work.
- Welfare to work.

1938
01:32:42,122 --> 01:32:44,113
That's a program
that ought to be stopped

1939
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:46,123
because it really has no merit.

1940
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:48,125
I think it adds more
to the problem

1941
01:32:48,262 --> 01:32:50,127
than it does to solve it.

1942
01:32:50,264 --> 01:32:52,095
- Really?
- I do.

1943
01:32:52,232 --> 01:32:54,097
- You're the sheriff
and you feel this way.

1944
01:32:54,234 --> 01:32:58,102
- I do, I do. I wish I could put
two parents in every home

1945
01:32:58,238 --> 01:32:59,796
and make every parent
equally responsible,

1946
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:01,237
but I can't do that.

1947
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:03,240
But we're not doing anything
by taking one parent

1948
01:33:03,377 --> 01:33:06,244
and putting them on a bus
and sending them out of town

1949
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:08,871
to make $5.50 an hour.

1950
01:33:09,016 --> 01:33:11,814
- This is the bus that she was
forced to ride every day

1951
01:33:11,952 --> 01:33:13,817
in order to work off
the welfare money

1952
01:33:13,954 --> 01:33:15,854
the state had given her.

1953
01:33:19,193 --> 01:33:21,559
She, and many others from Flint
who were poor,

1954
01:33:21,695 --> 01:33:24,562
would make the 80-mile
round-trip journey every day,

1955
01:33:24,698 --> 01:33:27,258
from Flint to Auburn Hills,
in Oakland County,

1956
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:31,770
one of the wealthiest areas
in the country.

1957
01:33:31,905 --> 01:33:33,770
Tamarla would leave

1958
01:33:33,907 --> 01:33:37,343
early in the morning
and return late at night,

1959
01:33:37,478 --> 01:33:40,845
rarely seeing
her young children.

1960
01:33:40,981 --> 01:33:44,075
- What's the point in doing that?
Where does the state benefit?

1961
01:33:44,218 --> 01:33:46,584
Where does Flint and Genesee
County benefit from that?

1962
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:49,587
We have a child dead.
I think that may be, in part,

1963
01:33:49,723 --> 01:33:51,588
part of the problem.

1964
01:33:51,725 --> 01:33:55,092
We drove the one parent out.

1965
01:33:55,229 --> 01:33:59,097
Now, you or anybody else
that can tell me

1966
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:02,100
that that best serves
the community,

1967
01:34:02,236 --> 01:34:04,932
I shake my head and wonder why.

1968
01:34:05,072 --> 01:34:07,666
- How long you been riding
the bus?

1969
01:34:07,808 --> 01:34:09,241
- I've been working here

1970
01:34:09,376 --> 01:34:11,537
just about three years now.
- About three years?

1971
01:34:11,678 --> 01:34:15,045
- Yeah. My brother...
I got my brother working here,

1972
01:34:15,182 --> 01:34:17,047
half of my neighbourhood
works out here.

1973
01:34:17,184 --> 01:34:20,642
Just about everybody I know
personally works in the mall.

1974
01:34:20,787 --> 01:34:23,551
In Flint, doing the same thing
I'm doing now,

1975
01:34:23,690 --> 01:34:26,557
they only pay minimum wage
in Flint. I come 40 miles

1976
01:34:26,693 --> 01:34:29,059
to make three or four
dollars more an hour.

1977
01:34:29,196 --> 01:34:32,063
- How much do you make an hour?
- I make 8.50 now.

1978
01:34:32,199 --> 01:34:34,064
- Is that enough
to pay the bills?

1979
01:34:34,201 --> 01:34:35,600
- No.

1980
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:37,829
- So did you know Tamarla Owens,

1981
01:34:37,971 --> 01:34:40,872
the woman whose son
shot the little girl?

1982
01:34:41,008 --> 01:34:43,568
I think she rode this bus.
- I knew her a little bit.

1983
01:34:43,710 --> 01:34:46,076
Not real good.
- Nice lady?

1984
01:34:46,213 --> 01:34:49,580
- Yeah, she was okay. She came
to work every day, did her job.

1985
01:34:49,716 --> 01:34:52,082
She worked two jobs, so...
- She worked two jobs?

1986
01:34:52,219 --> 01:34:54,779
- She was trying
to make ends meet.

1987
01:34:54,922 --> 01:34:56,787
"We're going hopping
We're going hopping today

1988
01:34:56,924 --> 01:34:58,585
"Where things are popping...

1989
01:34:58,725 --> 01:35:00,852
- This is Dick Clark's
American Bandstand Grill,

1990
01:35:00,994 --> 01:35:03,963
where Tamarla worked
one of her two jobs.

1991
01:35:04,097 --> 01:35:05,962
"On the Bandstand
Bandstand"

1992
01:35:06,099 --> 01:35:09,591
- I think she worked in this room
here, as a bartender,

1993
01:35:09,736 --> 01:35:13,536
fountain-person making drinks,
making shakes, desserts.

1994
01:35:13,674 --> 01:35:16,302
- Was she a good employee?
- Yeah, she was.

1995
01:35:16,443 --> 01:35:19,412
She also worked at the Fudgery,
in the mall here.

1996
01:35:22,249 --> 01:35:24,717
- Dick Clark is
an American icon,

1997
01:35:24,851 --> 01:35:27,911
the man who brought rock'n'roll
into our homes every week

1998
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:28,953
on American Bandstand.

1999
01:35:29,089 --> 01:35:31,455
- Every part of your life,
you can link up

2000
01:35:31,592 --> 01:35:33,492
to a part of music, usually.
So, as Dick says,

2001
01:35:33,627 --> 01:35:35,561
"It's the soundtrack
of our lives."

2002
01:35:35,696 --> 01:35:38,756
Music's the soundtrack
of our lives.

2003
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:41,060
- His restaurant and the
Fudgery, here in Auburn Hills,

2004
01:35:41,201 --> 01:35:43,897
applied for special tax breaks
because they were using

2005
01:35:44,037 --> 01:35:45,902
welfare people as employees.

2006
01:35:46,039 --> 01:35:48,234
Even though Tamarla worked
up to 70 hours a week

2007
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:50,240
at these two jobs

2008
01:35:50,377 --> 01:35:53,904
in the mall, she did not earn
enough to pay her rent.

2009
01:35:54,047 --> 01:35:55,912
And one week before
the shooting,

2010
01:35:56,049 --> 01:35:57,812
was told by her landlord

2011
01:35:57,951 --> 01:35:59,816
that he was evicting her.

2012
01:35:59,953 --> 01:36:02,444
With nowhere to go
and not wanting to take

2013
01:36:02,589 --> 01:36:06,116
her two children out of school,
Tamarla asked her brother

2014
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:08,660
if they could stay with him
for a few weeks.

2015
01:36:08,795 --> 01:36:10,592
It was there that Tamarla's son

2016
01:36:10,731 --> 01:36:15,498
found a small 32-calibre gun
and took it to school.

2017
01:36:15,636 --> 01:36:18,036
Tamarla did not see him
take the gun to school,

2018
01:36:18,171 --> 01:36:21,038
because she was on a state bus
to go serve drinks

2019
01:36:21,174 --> 01:36:23,540
and make fudge for rich people.

2020
01:36:23,677 --> 01:36:26,305
"Bandstand"

2021
01:36:29,449 --> 01:36:31,314
I decided to fly out
to California

2022
01:36:31,451 --> 01:36:34,249
to ask Dick Clark what
he thought about a system

2023
01:36:34,388 --> 01:36:36,686
that forces poor,
single mothers to work

2024
01:36:36,823 --> 01:36:39,053
two low-wage jobs to survive.

2025
01:36:39,192 --> 01:36:43,060
I'm doing a documentary
on these school shootings

2026
01:36:43,196 --> 01:36:45,061
and, you know,
guns and all that.

2027
01:36:45,198 --> 01:36:49,066
And in my hometown of Flint
Michigan, which you know,

2028
01:36:49,202 --> 01:36:51,568
this little six-year-old
shot a six-year-old--

2029
01:36:51,705 --> 01:36:54,572
- Get in the car, Dave!
Watch your arm, watch your arm.

2030
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:57,575
- Oop, sorry, sorry.
- I'm sorry, we're really late.

2031
01:36:57,711 --> 01:37:00,578
- Anyways, but the mother of
the kid who did the shooting

2032
01:37:00,714 --> 01:37:03,080
works at Dick Clark's
All-American Grill...

2033
01:37:03,216 --> 01:37:05,081
- Forget it.
- ...in Oakland County...

2034
01:37:05,218 --> 01:37:07,083
- Close the door.
- A Welfare-to-work program--

2035
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:09,085
- Close the door.
- These people are forced...

2036
01:37:09,222 --> 01:37:11,019
Dick, no...
- Bye-bye. Come on, move over!

2037
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:14,025
- I want you to help me convince
the governor of Michigan...

2038
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:17,028
It's a Welfare-to-work pro...
These women are forced to work!

2039
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:19,029
They've got kids at home. Dick!

2040
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:20,793
Ah, jeez!

2041
01:37:20,934 --> 01:37:23,528
In George Bush's America,

2042
01:37:23,670 --> 01:37:26,400
the poor were not a priority.

2043
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:29,236
And after September 11th, 2001,

2044
01:37:29,376 --> 01:37:31,844
correcting America's
social problems

2045
01:37:31,978 --> 01:37:33,878
took a back seat to fear,

2046
01:37:34,014 --> 01:37:36,744
panic and a new set
of priorities.

2047
01:37:36,883 --> 01:37:39,545
- One way to express our unity

2048
01:37:39,686 --> 01:37:43,554
is for Congress to set
the military budget,

2049
01:37:43,690 --> 01:37:45,555
the defence of
the United States,

2050
01:37:45,692 --> 01:37:49,526
as the number-one priority
and fully fund my request!

2051
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:56,294
- We've been selling
a lot of chemical suits,

2052
01:37:56,436 --> 01:37:59,064
with the gloves and the hoods.

2053
01:37:59,206 --> 01:38:01,367
And we've been selling
a lot of gas masks.

2054
01:38:01,508 --> 01:38:03,703
- I'm trying to get one
for myself and my puppy.

2055
01:38:03,844 --> 01:38:05,607
[female reporter]:
Denis Marks and his wife

2056
01:38:05,746 --> 01:38:06,906
have been stocking up supplies.

2057
01:38:07,047 --> 01:38:09,106
- Weapons, ammunition...

2058
01:38:09,249 --> 01:38:11,046
[ male reporter]: Wal-Mart says
after September 11th,

2059
01:38:11,184 --> 01:38:13,516
gun sales surged 70%,

2060
01:38:13,653 --> 01:38:15,746
ammunition up 140%.

2061
01:38:15,889 --> 01:38:17,880
In Dallas, they're
already taking potshots

2062
01:38:18,024 --> 01:38:19,889
at Osama bin Laden.

2063
01:38:20,026 --> 01:38:21,891
- In the months following
the 9/11 attacks,

2064
01:38:22,028 --> 01:38:25,725
we, Americans, were gripped
in a state of fear.

2065
01:38:25,866 --> 01:38:27,800
None of us knew
if we too would die

2066
01:38:27,934 --> 01:38:30,300
at the hands of the evildoers,

2067
01:38:30,437 --> 01:38:31,927
or who might be sitting

2068
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:34,905
next to some crazy guy trying
to light his shoes on fire.

2069
01:38:35,041 --> 01:38:36,599
The threat seemed very real.

2070
01:38:36,743 --> 01:38:40,042
- Sounds a little paranoid but
I'm not gonna take the chance.

2071
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:42,148
Just trying to protect
myself and my family.

2072
01:38:42,282 --> 01:38:44,182
- Our growing fears were turned

2073
01:38:44,317 --> 01:38:46,285
into a handsome profit
for many.

2074
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:47,819
- Mike Blake has seen

2075
01:38:47,954 --> 01:38:49,979
a 30% increase in sales at ADT

2076
01:38:50,123 --> 01:38:51,249
over the last month.

2077
01:38:51,391 --> 01:38:54,121
Most of the people he talks to
are still a little uneasy

2078
01:38:54,261 --> 01:38:56,422
over the September 11th
terrorist attacks.

2079
01:38:56,563 --> 01:38:58,827
- How are we afraid of all these
things, it's because

2080
01:38:58,965 --> 01:39:01,957
a lot of people are making
a lot of money off of it

2081
01:39:02,102 --> 01:39:04,093
and a lot of careers off of it.

2082
01:39:04,237 --> 01:39:06,262
And so, there's
vested interests,

2083
01:39:06,406 --> 01:39:08,772
a lot of activity
to keep us afraid.

2084
01:39:08,909 --> 01:39:11,571
- And what better way to fight
box-cutter-wielding terrorists

2085
01:39:11,711 --> 01:39:14,077
than to order a record number
of fighter jets

2086
01:39:14,214 --> 01:39:16,011
from Lockheed?

2087
01:39:16,149 --> 01:39:18,947
Yes, everyone felt safer,
especially with the army

2088
01:39:19,085 --> 01:39:21,178
doing garbage detail
on Park Avenue.

2089
01:39:21,321 --> 01:39:23,414
And the greatest benefit
of all of a terrorized public

2090
01:39:23,557 --> 01:39:25,582
is that the corporate

2091
01:39:25,725 --> 01:39:30,594
and political leaders can get
away with just about anything.

2092
01:39:30,730 --> 01:39:32,595
- I've never seen
a better example

2093
01:39:32,732 --> 01:39:34,597
of cash-and-carry government

2094
01:39:34,734 --> 01:39:39,194
than this Bush administration
and Enron.

2095
01:39:39,339 --> 01:39:41,204
- There were a lot of things
that I didn't know

2096
01:39:41,341 --> 01:39:43,206
after the World Trade Center
attack,

2097
01:39:43,343 --> 01:39:47,541
but one thing was clear:
whether it was before or after

2098
01:39:47,681 --> 01:39:51,447
September 11th, a public that's
this out of control with fear

2099
01:39:51,585 --> 01:39:54,145
should not have a lot of guns
or ammo laying around.

2100
01:39:56,256 --> 01:40:00,625
- Well, I was shot with a Tech-9.

2101
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:02,625
- Nine millimetre?

2102
01:40:02,762 --> 01:40:04,662
- Yeah. Yeah, I was, uh...

2103
01:40:06,766 --> 01:40:08,631
I guess it was supposed
to be semi-automatic,

2104
01:40:08,768 --> 01:40:11,066
but it kind of seemed like
fully automatic to me,

2105
01:40:11,204 --> 01:40:14,401
from what I remember.
- This is Richard Costaldo.

2106
01:40:14,541 --> 01:40:18,568
And this is Mark Taylor.
Both of these boys were shot

2107
01:40:18,712 --> 01:40:20,907
the day of
the Columbine massacre.

2108
01:40:21,047 --> 01:40:25,108
Richard is paralyzed for life
and in a wheelchair.

2109
01:40:25,252 --> 01:40:29,086
And Mark is barely standing
after numerous operations.

2110
01:40:29,222 --> 01:40:31,588
- The kids at Columbine
had to pay a penalty.

2111
01:40:31,725 --> 01:40:33,750
We paid a penalty that day...
for this nation.

2112
01:40:33,894 --> 01:40:35,759
The way we look at it.

2113
01:40:35,896 --> 01:40:38,763
- Mark and Richard were disabled
and suffering

2114
01:40:38,899 --> 01:40:43,268
from the 17-cent K-Mart bullets
still embedded in their bodies.

2115
01:40:43,403 --> 01:40:46,634
As they showed me the various
entry points for the bullets,

2116
01:40:46,773 --> 01:40:49,105
I thought of one way
we could reduce

2117
01:40:49,242 --> 01:40:53,269
the number of guns and bullets
laying around. I asked the boys

2118
01:40:53,413 --> 01:40:57,281
if they'd like to go to K-Mart
to return the merchandise.

2119
01:41:00,253 --> 01:41:02,517
- Ready?
- You... you go.

2120
01:41:21,074 --> 01:41:25,033
K-Mart Headquarters
Troy, Michigan

2121
01:41:39,893 --> 01:41:41,258
- Hi.

2122
01:41:41,394 --> 01:41:43,259
- Excuse me, will you turn
the camera off, please?

2123
01:41:43,396 --> 01:41:46,263
- We're here to see Mr. Conaway.
- You have to turn the camera off

2124
01:41:46,399 --> 01:41:49,197
while you're in the building.
- Oh, okay, all right.

2125
01:41:49,269 --> 01:41:51,032
Okay, turn it off now.

2126
01:41:51,938 --> 01:41:54,202
[ One hour later]
- Hey, Michael.
- Hi, how are you?

2127
01:41:54,274 --> 01:41:56,765
- I'm Mary Lorenz. I'm director
of Media Relations for K-Mart.

2128
01:41:56,910 --> 01:41:59,105
- Oh, good. All right, good.
- How can I help you today?

2129
01:41:59,245 --> 01:42:02,112
- Well, I'm here today...
This is Richard Costaldo.

2130
01:42:02,248 --> 01:42:04,614
- Richard, nice to meet you.
- And this is Mark Taylor.

2131
01:42:04,751 --> 01:42:07,117
- Mark.
- And they're students

2132
01:42:07,253 --> 01:42:11,053
from Columbine High School.
They were shot at Columbine,

2133
01:42:11,191 --> 01:42:14,183
in the massacre,
with bullets from K-Mart.

2134
01:42:14,327 --> 01:42:17,023
- You came a long way.
All the way from Colorado.

2135
01:42:17,163 --> 01:42:21,065
- Yeah, I just...
I was thinking that...

2136
01:42:21,201 --> 01:42:23,066
since you stopped selling
the handguns and all,

2137
01:42:23,203 --> 01:42:27,071
it'd kind of make sense to stop
selling the bullets too.

2138
01:42:27,207 --> 01:42:30,074
- Our request is that you get rid
of nine-millimetre bullets

2139
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:32,405
and that you don't sell them
in the store completely.

2140
01:42:32,545 --> 01:42:35,070
- We do carry... You probably
are aware of K-Mart -

2141
01:42:35,215 --> 01:42:37,581
hopefully, you're shoppers
at our stores -

2142
01:42:37,717 --> 01:42:41,585
that we do only carry, you know,
sporting firearms

2143
01:42:41,721 --> 01:42:46,590
and the accessories
that go with the hunting sport.

2144
01:42:46,726 --> 01:42:50,093
And we'll certainly take your
message to our chairman and CEO,

2145
01:42:50,230 --> 01:42:52,494
Chuck Conaway.
He's not here today.

2146
01:42:52,632 --> 01:42:55,192
- He's not here today?
- No. He's not here, actually,

2147
01:42:55,335 --> 01:42:57,895
this whole week.
- Not at all during the week?

2148
01:42:58,038 --> 01:43:00,905
Do you have a limit on the
number of bullets, ammunition,

2149
01:43:01,041 --> 01:43:02,906
that people can purchase?
- You know, I can't answer

2150
01:43:03,043 --> 01:43:05,102
these questions for you.
I'm not the merchandiser

2151
01:43:05,245 --> 01:43:06,644
who places those products
in our stores.

2152
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:07,974
- Can we speak to that person?

2153
01:43:08,114 --> 01:43:10,173
- But I can get answers
to those questions for you.

2154
01:43:10,316 --> 01:43:12,807
If you leave your card, I could
get those answers for you.

2155
01:43:12,952 --> 01:43:14,419
- We don't want to leave a card.

2156
01:43:14,554 --> 01:43:16,715
The reason why
we can't take a card

2157
01:43:16,856 --> 01:43:18,756
and come back
is because Mark here,

2158
01:43:18,892 --> 01:43:21,759
he's got a K-Mart bullet
just an inch away... right?

2159
01:43:21,895 --> 01:43:23,760
- Yeah.
- From your aorta.

2160
01:43:23,897 --> 01:43:27,128
- In between my aorta and spine.
- Between your aorta and spine.

2161
01:43:27,267 --> 01:43:29,963
- I'm glad to see that
you're still able to stand.

2162
01:43:30,103 --> 01:43:32,571
- And I told him that somebody
here would listen,

2163
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:35,072
somebody here would... would...

2164
01:43:35,208 --> 01:43:39,076
would take the request
seriously. Not just a PR person,

2165
01:43:39,212 --> 01:43:41,077
but somebody who has some
authority and can answer

2166
01:43:41,214 --> 01:43:43,648
some of the questions
that they want answered.

2167
01:43:43,783 --> 01:43:45,648
- K-Mart does care about this,

2168
01:43:45,785 --> 01:43:47,650
but I can't go any further
right now.

2169
01:43:47,787 --> 01:43:49,652
So until I make a call, um,

2170
01:43:49,789 --> 01:43:52,280
I'm gonna go back to the office

2171
01:43:52,425 --> 01:43:54,950
and see if there's anyone
in merchandising...

2172
01:43:55,095 --> 01:43:58,394
- Mary went back upstairs.
And two hours later,

2173
01:43:58,531 --> 01:44:01,398
she brought down this guy whose
job it is to buy the bullets

2174
01:44:01,534 --> 01:44:02,899
for K-Mart.

2175
01:44:03,036 --> 01:44:05,596
- Good. Stay out of trouble.
- Yes.

2176
01:44:05,739 --> 01:44:07,900
- We're not the ones in trouble,
guys.

2177
01:44:08,041 --> 01:44:10,100
Mark thought he'd show him
his bullet wounds.

2178
01:44:10,243 --> 01:44:12,040
Those are his bullet holes.
- Hm.

2179
01:44:12,178 --> 01:44:14,043
- From your bullets.

2180
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:16,808
That's where the K-Mart bullets
went in.

2181
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:18,815
- Well, take care.

2182
01:44:18,952 --> 01:44:21,546
- Is anybody else gonna
come down?

2183
01:44:21,688 --> 01:44:23,553
Is anybody else gonna come down?
Is that it?

2184
01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:25,920
- I'll check.
- Okay, thank you.

2185
01:44:26,059 --> 01:44:28,550
We waited around
a couple more hours

2186
01:44:28,695 --> 01:44:30,822
but no one else came down.

2187
01:44:30,964 --> 01:44:33,933
As we left the building,
Mark came up with an idea.

2188
01:44:34,067 --> 01:44:35,932
He suggested that we go

2189
01:44:36,069 --> 01:44:40,836
to the nearest K-Mart
and buy out all their bullets.

2190
01:44:40,974 --> 01:44:43,772
- Just take as many of those
as you can.

2191
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:46,276
- Yeah, you can come around here
and look.

2192
01:44:46,412 --> 01:44:49,006
- What else do we have over here?

2193
01:44:49,149 --> 01:44:52,016
You got 357. Sure, I'll take 'em
all, take everything you got.

2194
01:44:52,152 --> 01:44:54,586
- So you're 17? You're what?
- Sixteen.

2195
01:44:54,721 --> 01:44:56,086
- Wait.

2196
01:44:56,222 --> 01:44:58,087
- Oh, shit!

2197
01:44:58,224 --> 01:45:00,522
- Oh, my God...

2198
01:45:00,660 --> 01:45:03,595
- Mark pretty much cleaned them
out of their ammunition.

2199
01:45:03,730 --> 01:45:06,961
And the next day, we decided to
go back to K-Mart headquarters

2200
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:09,125
with all the bullets.
This time,

2201
01:45:09,302 --> 01:45:10,792
we brought the press.

2202
01:45:11,004 --> 01:45:12,335
- Our local first coverage
of south-eastern Michigan

2203
01:45:12,505 --> 01:45:14,029
continues now
with all-new stories.

2204
01:45:16,943 --> 01:45:18,968
- Coming up here on
our six-o'clock report,

2205
01:45:19,112 --> 01:45:20,841
a warning to everyone this
summer to watch out for snakes.

2206
01:45:20,947 --> 01:45:23,916
You'll hear from a mom who was
bitten by a rattlesnake.

2207
01:45:24,050 --> 01:45:25,915
- And also, students who survived
the Columbine massacre

2208
01:45:26,052 --> 01:45:29,544
are in town.
They are very angry with K-Mart.

2209
01:45:29,689 --> 01:45:32,658
- We're here to see Chuck
Conaway, the chairman of K-Mart.

2210
01:45:32,792 --> 01:45:34,555
- How you doing, sir?
It's always a pleasure.

2211
01:45:34,694 --> 01:45:38,061
Okay, uh...

2212
01:45:38,198 --> 01:45:41,099
They would like to speak
to Mr. Conaway.

2213
01:45:41,234 --> 01:45:45,000
- Here's the nine-millimetres.

2214
01:45:45,138 --> 01:45:47,663
These are the bullets
that are in both Richard

2215
01:45:47,807 --> 01:45:50,105
and in Mark's body right now.

2216
01:45:57,650 --> 01:45:58,674
- Move your group outside.

2217
01:45:58,818 --> 01:46:00,718
I'll have somebody here
in five minutes.

2218
01:46:00,854 --> 01:46:02,378
- Do me a favour,
don't block the door.

2219
01:46:02,522 --> 01:46:04,046
Just off to the side,
if you would.

2220
01:46:04,190 --> 01:46:05,748
- Will go outside and
somebody will come out.

2221
01:46:05,892 --> 01:46:06,950
- My name's Laurie McTavish.

2222
01:46:07,093 --> 01:46:09,653
I'm the Vice-president of
Communications for K-Mart.

2223
01:46:09,796 --> 01:46:13,027
I'm happy to deliver a statement
on behalf of the company.

2224
01:46:13,166 --> 01:46:16,533
What happened in Columbine,
Colorado, was truly tragic

2225
01:46:16,669 --> 01:46:18,534
and touched every American.

2226
01:46:18,671 --> 01:46:21,037
We're sorry for the...

2227
01:46:21,174 --> 01:46:23,233
disadvantage to this young man.

2228
01:46:23,376 --> 01:46:26,038
K-Mart is phasing out the sale
of handgun ammunition.

2229
01:46:26,179 --> 01:46:29,478
The business plan calls
for this to be complete

2230
01:46:29,616 --> 01:46:33,552
in the continental U.S.
within the next 90 days.

2231
01:46:33,686 --> 01:46:35,051
- Wow! Wow!

2232
01:46:35,188 --> 01:46:37,053
- K-Mart representatives met
with Mr. Moore

2233
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:39,556
and the students from Columbine,
Colorado, yesterday,

2234
01:46:39,692 --> 01:46:42,559
and listened to their concerns
about the product

2235
01:46:42,695 --> 01:46:44,560
carried in K-Mart stores.

2236
01:46:44,697 --> 01:46:47,564
The company committed,
at the end of that meeting,

2237
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:51,431
that K-Mart would have an answer
for them within a week's time.

2238
01:46:51,571 --> 01:46:54,438
- Well, the first thing we want
to do is thank you

2239
01:46:54,574 --> 01:46:58,066
for committing to no longer
selling handgun ammunition

2240
01:46:58,211 --> 01:47:00,076
in your stores.
And within 90 days--

2241
01:47:00,213 --> 01:47:02,579
- The process will be phased out
within 90 days.

2242
01:47:02,715 --> 01:47:05,081
- And after 90 days,
there will be no more selling

2243
01:47:05,218 --> 01:47:08,085
of ammunition that can go into
handguns or assault weapons.

2244
01:47:08,221 --> 01:47:10,416
- Firearm ammunition, will be...
We will not sell it,

2245
01:47:10,556 --> 01:47:12,421
after 90 days, in our stores.

2246
01:47:12,558 --> 01:47:15,356
- We greatly appreciate that.
- Thank you.

2247
01:47:15,495 --> 01:47:17,554
- Thank you very much. Thank you.
That's very brave.

2248
01:47:20,667 --> 01:47:22,328
Thank you. Wow!

2249
01:47:22,468 --> 01:47:25,699
That blows my mind. That's
more than what we asked for.

2250
01:47:25,838 --> 01:47:28,534
- It's remarkable.
- Yeah. Well, like I told you--

2251
01:47:28,675 --> 01:47:30,540
- I didn't think--
- Did you think?

2252
01:47:30,677 --> 01:47:32,542
- No!
- We're like, uh...

We're just getting ready to...
We're going to the airport.

2254

The kids from Columbine had
scored an overwhelming victory

2255
01:47:39,686 --> 01:47:41,551
against K-Mart
and it inspired me

2256
01:47:41,688 --> 01:47:45,784
to do something that
I knew I had to do.

2257
01:47:45,925 --> 01:47:48,485

- I agree.

2308
01:50:35,728 --> 01:50:38,094
I totally agree with that.
I'm just saying... I mean,

2309
01:50:38,231 --> 01:50:39,596
the second amendment gives me--

2310
01:50:39,732 --> 01:50:41,597
- Let's say it's
a comfort factor.

2311
01:50:41,734 --> 01:50:44,601
- It gives you comfort to know
that there's a loaded gun.

2312
01:50:44,737 --> 01:50:46,102
- Yeah.

2313
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:49,106
- Comfort meaning that it allows
you to relax and feel safe?

2314
01:50:49,242 --> 01:50:51,107
- Not worry about it.
- Not worry, not be afraid.

2315
01:50:51,244 --> 01:50:53,041
- And I'm not really, but, uh...

2316
01:50:53,179 --> 01:50:57,616
I'm exercising one of the rights
passed on down to me

2317
01:50:57,750 --> 01:51:00,617
from those wise, old, dead white
guys that invented this country.

2318
01:51:00,753 --> 01:51:03,722
If it was good enough for them,
it's good enough for me.

2319
01:51:03,856 --> 01:51:05,517
- But you could still
exercise the right,

2320
01:51:05,658 --> 01:51:08,092
just by having a gun unloaded
and locked away somewhere.

2321
01:51:08,227 --> 01:51:09,387
- I choose to have it.

2322
01:51:09,529 --> 01:51:12,054
- What sort of strikes me
as interesting is that,

2323
01:51:12,198 --> 01:51:15,065
in other countries, where
they don't have the murder rate,

2324
01:51:15,201 --> 01:51:17,066
the gun-murder rate
that we have, that, uh...

2325
01:51:17,203 --> 01:51:19,068
many people say,

2326
01:51:19,205 --> 01:51:21,070
"Well, that's because
they don't have guns around.

2327
01:51:21,207 --> 01:51:24,074
It's hard to get a gun in
Britain or Germany or whatever."

2328
01:51:24,210 --> 01:51:28,078
But we went to Canada and
there's seven million guns

2329
01:51:28,214 --> 01:51:30,205
in 10-million homes.
- There won't be very long.

2330
01:51:30,349 --> 01:51:31,873
- But hear me out, though.
- Okay.

2331
01:51:32,018 --> 01:51:33,576
- Canada is a nation of hunters,

2332
01:51:33,719 --> 01:51:35,584
millions of guns,

2333
01:51:35,721 --> 01:51:38,588
and yet, they had just
a few murders last year.

2334
01:51:38,724 --> 01:51:40,589
That's it. A country
of 30-million people.

2335
01:51:40,726 --> 01:51:43,593
Now, why - here's my question -
why is it that...

2336
01:51:43,729 --> 01:51:45,720
that they've got all these guns
laying around,

2337
01:51:45,865 --> 01:51:47,730
yet they don't kill each other

2338
01:51:47,867 --> 01:51:49,732
at the level that
we kill each other?

2339
01:51:49,869 --> 01:51:52,099
- I think American history is...

2340
01:51:52,238 --> 01:51:54,604
uh... has a lot of blood

2341
01:51:54,740 --> 01:51:56,605
on its hands.
- And Germany history doesn't?

2342
01:51:56,742 --> 01:51:58,607
- No.
- And British history?

2343
01:51:58,744 --> 01:52:01,110
- I don't think as much.
- Oh, are you...

2344
01:52:01,247 --> 01:52:03,613
Germans don't have as much,
blood on their hands?

2345
01:52:03,749 --> 01:52:06,115
- Uh, they do, yes.
- The Brits, they ruled the world

2346
01:52:06,252 --> 01:52:08,618
for 300 years
at the barrel of a gun.

2347
01:52:08,754 --> 01:52:12,053
They're all violent people. They
have bad guys, they have crime,

2348
01:52:12,191 --> 01:52:14,557
they have lots of guns--

2349
01:52:14,694 --> 01:52:18,562
- Well, it's an interesting
point, which can be explored

2350
01:52:18,698 --> 01:52:22,065
and you're good to explore it
at great lengths,

2351
01:52:22,201 --> 01:52:25,068
but I think that's about all
I have to say on it.

2352
01:52:25,204 --> 01:52:28,071
- You don't have any opinion,
though, as to why that is,

2353
01:52:28,207 --> 01:52:30,072
that we are the unique country,
the only country,

2354
01:52:30,209 --> 01:52:33,076
that does this, that kills each
other on this level, with guns?

2355
01:52:33,212 --> 01:52:37,080
- Well, we have, probably,
more mixed ethnicity

2356
01:52:37,216 --> 01:52:40,583
than other countries,
some other countries.

2357
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:42,585
- You think it's an ethnic thing?

2358
01:52:42,722 --> 01:52:44,587
- No, I don't. It's...

2359
01:52:44,724 --> 01:52:46,589
I wouldn't go so far
as to say that.

2360
01:52:46,726 --> 01:52:50,093
We had enough problems with
civil rights in the beginning.

2361
01:52:50,229 --> 01:52:54,097
It's... But, uh, I have
no answer for that.

2362
01:52:54,233 --> 01:52:56,599
- What do you mean, you think
it's a mixed ethnicity?

2363
01:52:56,736 --> 01:52:58,601
I don't understand.

2364
01:52:58,738 --> 01:53:00,603
- You said, "How is it that..."
- That we're unique.

2365
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:04,608
- "So many Americans
kill each other?"

2366
01:53:04,744 --> 01:53:07,008
I don't know that that's true,
but, uh...

2367
01:53:07,146 --> 01:53:08,511
- Well, no, you know that.

2368
01:53:08,648 --> 01:53:11,549
We know we have the highest
murder rate with guns.

2369
01:53:11,684 --> 01:53:13,549
It's way higher
than any other country.

2370
01:53:13,686 --> 01:53:17,053
- The only answer I can give you
is the one I already gave you.

2371
01:53:17,189 --> 01:53:20,056
- Which is?
- Which is that we have, uh...

2372
01:53:20,192 --> 01:53:23,059
- Historically--
- ...a history of violence.

2373
01:53:23,195 --> 01:53:26,562
Perhaps more than most
countries. Not more than Russia,

2374
01:53:26,699 --> 01:53:29,566
not more than Japan or China--
- Not more than Germany.

2375
01:53:29,702 --> 01:53:34,196
- Not more than Germany,
but certainly more than Canada.

2376
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:37,070
- I come from Flint, Michigan,
and last year,

2377
01:53:37,209 --> 01:53:40,076
a little six-year-old boy
took a gun into a classroom

2378
01:53:40,212 --> 01:53:43,181
and shot and killed a
six-year-old girl. And, uh...

2379
01:53:43,316 --> 01:53:45,511
it was really a tragic thing--

2380
01:53:45,651 --> 01:53:48,620
- This was a kid, though.
- A six-year-old, yeah.

2381
01:53:48,754 --> 01:53:50,187
Did you hear about this?

2382
01:53:50,323 --> 01:53:52,985
A six-year-old shooting
a six-year-old?

2383
01:53:53,125 --> 01:53:54,558
- Yeah.
- Well, here's my question.

2384
01:53:54,694 --> 01:53:55,592
After that happened,

2385
01:53:55,728 --> 01:53:57,593
you came to Flint
and held a big rally.

2386
01:53:57,730 --> 01:53:59,095
- Mm-hm.

2387
01:53:59,231 --> 01:54:01,597
- And, you know, I just--

2388
01:54:01,734 --> 01:54:04,100
- So did the vice-president.

2389
01:54:04,236 --> 01:54:07,103
- Yeah, but did you feel it was
being at all insensitive

2390
01:54:07,239 --> 01:54:09,605
to the fact that this community
had just gone through--

2391
01:54:09,742 --> 01:54:12,540
- Actually, I wasn't aware
of that at the time we came.

2392
01:54:12,678 --> 01:54:16,045
We came and did an
early-morning, uh... rally,

2393
01:54:16,182 --> 01:54:18,047
then went on to wherever
we were going.

2394
01:54:18,184 --> 01:54:21,051
- You didn't know at the time,
that this killing had happened?

2395
01:54:21,187 --> 01:54:23,052
- No.
- Had you known, would you have--

2396
01:54:23,189 --> 01:54:25,054
- Would I have cancelled
the... uh...

2397
01:54:25,191 --> 01:54:27,056
- Yeah.
- I don't...

2398
01:54:27,193 --> 01:54:28,558
Hard to say.

2399
01:54:28,694 --> 01:54:30,559
- It wasn't like it was
already planned.

2400
01:54:30,696 --> 01:54:32,561
I mean, the choice to come there
was made

2401
01:54:32,698 --> 01:54:34,563
after this horrible
killing took place.

2402
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:36,065
- Yeah. Mm-hm.

2403
01:54:36,202 --> 01:54:39,069
- You know, had you know that,
would you have come?

2404
01:54:39,205 --> 01:54:42,072
- I don't know. I have no idea.

2405
01:54:42,208 --> 01:54:44,199
- Maybe not. Maybe not.
- Okay. Thank you.

2406
01:54:44,343 --> 01:54:47,574
- You think you'd like to just
maybe apologize to the people

2407
01:54:47,713 --> 01:54:50,580
in Flint for coming and doing
that at that time, or...?

2408
01:54:50,716 --> 01:54:52,581
- You want me to apologize...

2409
01:54:52,718 --> 01:54:54,583
me, apologize to the people
in Flint?

2410
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:56,620
- Or the people in Columbine

2411
01:54:56,756 --> 01:54:59,088
for coming after
their horrible tragedy.

2412
01:54:59,225 --> 01:55:01,591
Why do you go to the places
after they have

2413
01:55:01,727 --> 01:55:04,093
these horrible tragedies? I'm
a member of your group here--

2414
01:55:04,230 --> 01:55:07,097
- Well, I'm afraid
we don't agree on... on that.

2415
01:55:07,233 --> 01:55:09,599
- You think it's okay
to just come and show up

2416
01:55:09,735 --> 01:55:12,033
at these events.
- No.

2417
01:55:12,171 --> 01:55:14,071
- You don't think it's okay?

2418
01:55:25,084 --> 01:55:27,780
Mr. Heston, just one more thing.

2419
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:29,785
This is who she is -

2420
01:55:29,922 --> 01:55:32,516
or was. This is her.

2421
01:55:32,658 --> 01:55:34,523
Mr. Heston, please don't leave.

2422
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:37,356
Mr. Heston, please,
take a look at her.

2423
01:55:37,496 --> 01:55:40,090
This is the girl.

2424
01:56:31,150 --> 01:56:34,551
I left the Heston estate
atop Beverly Hills

2425
01:56:34,687 --> 01:56:36,655
and walked back
into the real world,

2426
01:56:36,789 --> 01:56:40,020
an America living
and breathing in fear...

2427
01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:42,059
In your mind,
you imagine somebody

2428
01:56:42,194 --> 01:56:45,061
who might break into your house,
to harm you or your family.

2429
01:56:45,197 --> 01:56:48,564
What does that person look like?

2430
01:56:48,701 --> 01:56:51,534
- You. Her. Him.
The camera guy, anybody.

2431
01:56:51,670 --> 01:56:54,036
Could be a gun in the camera,
I don't know.

2432
01:56:54,173 --> 01:56:56,835
- Where gun sales were now
at an all-time high...

2433
01:56:56,976 --> 01:57:00,070
- Can shoot as fast as
Wesson semi-automatic.

2434
01:57:00,212 --> 01:57:02,180
- And where, in the end,

2435
01:57:02,314 --> 01:57:04,373
it all comes back to bowling

2436
01:57:04,517 --> 01:57:06,382
for Columbine.

2437
01:57:06,519 --> 01:57:09,044
- Three bowling-alley employees
shot to death Sunday night

2438
01:57:09,188 --> 01:57:10,587
at the AMF Broadway Lanes.

2439
01:57:10,723 --> 01:57:13,521
- There's nothing I really know.
I really don't know anything.

2440
01:57:13,659 --> 01:57:16,184
- Just that three people died.
- Right.

2441
01:57:16,328 --> 01:57:17,852
- In Littleton,
in a bowling alley.

2442
01:57:17,997 --> 01:57:19,555
I'm sorry.

2443
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:24,965
Yes, it was a glorious time
to be an American.

2444
01:57:30,843 --> 01:57:34,540
"I see trees of green

2445
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:37,046
"Red roses too

2446
01:57:37,182 --> 01:57:40,049
"I see them bloom

2447
01:57:40,185 --> 01:57:42,050
