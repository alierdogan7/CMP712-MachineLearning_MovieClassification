285
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,062
Kanemitsu-san,

286
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,398
please, that's not necessary.

287
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:52,448
Gentlemen.

288
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:58,580
You are now looking
at a company in transition.

289
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:00,999
Needless to say,

290
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:05,962
this has resulted
in the implementation
of certain, uh, well...

291
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,257
Let's call them cutbacks.

292
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:13,219
But who can
put a price tag on a dream?

293
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:18,433
Our esteemed former
chairman had a dream.

294
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,476
He called it Delta City.

295
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,021
Knock it off, Johnson.

296
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,859
The great city
of Detroit

297
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,570
represents an important
precedent, gentlemen.

298
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,573
There's only
one small problem.

299
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,534
It's turning into
a war zone!

300
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,870
Sir, it's just a small
resistance group.

301
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,123
And there's no reason
to believe they pose
a significant threat.

302
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,875
Well, I'd consider

303
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,544
a deficit of $350 million

304
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,296
a significant threat,

305
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,923
wouldn't you, Johnson?

306
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:53,009
Fleck!
Sir.

307
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,929
You're in charge
of Security Concepts.

308
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:59,224
Where's that Robocop
we spent so much money on?

309
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,601
The police
had a little problem
with the unit, sir.

310
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,228
I'm dealing with it
personally.

311
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,856
You do that.
You get him
to the Rehab team,

312
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:10,944
and maybe we won't
have to worry about
a small resistance group.

313
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,197
Get the hell out of here!
All of you!

314
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,823
You take your time.

315
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,243
And for God's sakes, Fleck,

316
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,703
try to get the police
on our side.

317
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:29,128
What if I don't want
a robot on my team?

318
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,840
You've got four days,
McDaggett.

319
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:37,595
If Cadillac Heights
isn't cleared for demolition
by Friday midnight,

320
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,597
our loans
will be called in.

321
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,349
OCP will be ruined.

322
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,268
We made a deal,
didn't we, chum?

323
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,562
By the way,

324
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,482
if you're just now
figuring out

325
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,485
the line between
big business and war

326
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:54,529
is a little blurry,

327
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:58,199
then you're further
over the hill than
they say you are.

328
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,503
This is entrapment.

329
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:55,131
My client was visiting
close personal friends
in that motel.

330
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,468
Hey, buddy, your client's
close personal friends

331
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:01,637
were a non-union video crew
and a German shepherd.

332
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:05,183
That's prejudicial.
Did the arresting officer
ask to see their union cards?

333
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,267
Yeah, yeah!

334
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,853
Cecil, come
get this crap.

335
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,938
Will somebody please
answer the damn phone?

336
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,775
Metro West. No, ma'am,
we're not on strike.

337
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:18,446
You could've fooled me.
I'll deal with them
looters myself,

338
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,282
get me a baseball bat
with some nails in it.

339
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,335
How're you feeling, Murphy?

340
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:34,796
I've been better.

341
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,548
Well, I'll be
honest with you,

342
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,967
it looks like you
just made friends
with a Mack truck.

343
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:43,638
I don't have many

344
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,264
friends.

345
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,808
Captain gave me
the same speech.

346
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,643
Yeah, well,
I heard it before.

347
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,812
How many times
does that make
"before"?

348
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,902
Dr. Lazarus?

349
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,447
You want to tell me
what happened.

350
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:04,283
Well, Atlanta beat
the Pistons last night.

351
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:07,078
That's cute.
I meant with, uh, glory boy.

352
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,413
Him.

353
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,166
He got shot to hell
and, uh, set on fire.

354
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,752
You know what
I'm talking about.
He disobeyed a direct order.

355
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:16,129
I want to know why.

356
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,255
My real opinion?

357
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,507
No, lie. Make up a story.

358
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,343
Well, Mr. Fleck,

359
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:27,098
offhand, I'd say
the only reason

360
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,808
he'd disobey an order

361
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,102
is if he didn't
agree with it.

362
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:35,481
Excuse me?

363
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,067
Well, he made a decision.

364
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:40,778
His friend was in trouble
and he made a judgment call.

365
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:42,613
Cops do that, you know.
It's in the manual.

366
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,783
Human cops do that.
What do you mean, his friend?
This thing's a machine.

367
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,570
Look, if OCP
just wanted a robot,
why the hell did they

368
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:50,288
put Murphy in there
in the first place?

369
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,748
Murphy's dead, sweetheart.
That's on record.

370
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,917
Mr. Fleck, this is Murphy.

371
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,546
What's left of his face,
portions of the cerebrum,
the cerebellum,

372
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,965
it's human tissue
that's still alive.

373
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,634
How can you interface
human components
with a machine

374
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,053
and then complain
when the human part
makes a decision?

375
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,473
Okay.

376
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,933
So, not only

377
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,102
did we get Murphy's
years of training

378
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:16,481
and his
law enforcement skills,
we also inherited his...

379
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:20,902
His memories, his feelings,
his emotional baggage?

380
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,446
Well, I'd call it
his humanity,

381
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,073
but I don't think
you know that word.

382
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,243
I see, well...

383
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,414
Tell you what, Doctor,
you talked me into it.
His emotions, get rid of 'em.

384
00:30:34,283 --> 00:30:36,334
Find out where they're
located and erase them.

385
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,586
If that means wiping out
his memory, that's too bad.

386
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:44,383
Um, we could cut out
the appropriate circuits

387
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:47,970
by, uh, implanting
a micro neuro-barrier.

388
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:55,770
Do it.

389
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,066
'Cause I got news for you,
babe, I don't give a shit
how smart you are.

390
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,735
OCP owns the cops.
That means they own him.

391
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,695
It means they own
your cute little ass.

392
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,656
Nobody owns me.

393
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,658
Fine.

394
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:12,453
We want him
on the Rehab team.

395
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:14,747
That means you
make him predictable,

396
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,874
or you look
for a new job,
sweet cheeks.

397
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,841
I think I'm in love.

398
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,401
What's going through
your head, Murphy?

399
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,795
LEWIS: That's his family.

400
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,798
Do you want me to install
that neuro-barrier, Doctor?

401
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,508
No. I can do it.

402
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:18,561
I think I'd like
to be alone with him,
if it's all right?

403
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,383
<i>AIex, I thought</i>
<i>you'd never get home.</i>

404
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:59,185
Do not let the fact
that these people
are homeless sway you.

405
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:03,606
They are terrorists,
pure and simple.

406
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:09,236
On the screens
are suspected
rebel locations.

407
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,156
If any of these locations
appear on your regular beat,

408
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,449
check it out.

409
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,327
Make sure you report
any unusual findings...

410
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,745
Hey, Lewis.

411
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,957
Did you hear what
they did to Murphy?

412
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:24,602
...and a brief description
of the suspicious...

413
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,295
Murphy.

414
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,946
Hey, Lewis,
you want your body armor?

415
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,532
What? No.
I'm off duty.

416
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,162
What's up, anyway?

417
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,165
Do you have family?

418
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:45,875
Yeah. I have a brother
in Pittsburgh.

419
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,252
The one who doesn't call.
You know that.

420
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,839
Robo, are you okay?

421
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,632
I'm fine.

422
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:57,094
And call me Murphy.

423
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,036
Murphy?

424
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:13,003

talking about?

Did he booby trap
the 8th Street entrance?

509
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:39,700
Maybe.

510
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,023
Better get
mobilized, folks.

511
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,651
They got a little too close
to home that time.

512
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,863
It's not worth it, man.

513
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:20,157
It is not worth this shit!

514
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:24,494
You better take
a real deep breath
right now, Coontz.

515
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,913
Because if you don't

What about more Rehabs, sir?

594
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:01,104
We could recruit them
out of the existing
police department.

595
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:04,357
It will be cheaper
than hiring mercenaries.

596
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:08,194
And we could use
the Metro West facilities
as a staging area.

597
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,449
Give them a nominal raise
for an incentive.

598

You're a good man, Johnson.

I made you a vice president.

Well? Can you fix him?

604
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:08,314
This isn't a valve job
on a Chevy.

605
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,235
I never worked on
a damn Robocop before.

606
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,987

is hold onto the Heights
for three more days.

608

He can hold out
till then, can't he?

610
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:26,082

611
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,459

612
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,169
Well, who the hell does?

00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,255

Who are you?

618
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,220
I'm friends with Robocop.

619
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:25,892
Well,
he's not here.
I'm sorry.

620
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:28,436
You don't believe me.

621
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,278
To tell you the truth,
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

622
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:39,781
He... He had
a message for you.

623
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:43,493
He said to thank you

624
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,578
for not taking
his memories away.

625
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,893
Well, well, well.

626
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,272
Afraid you're
a little late, pal.

627
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,235
You must be one

628
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,612

00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,744
Your boss.

631
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:30,415
He kind of owns OCP.

632
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:33,668
And OCP is kind of
on our shit list
with a bullet.

633
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:17,712
So you wanna know
where the rebels are?

634
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,966
You can tell your bosses
to kiss my ass.

00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:04,050
A vehicle is approaching.

636
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:01,774

637
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:03,901

It looks like
a direct hit
to the heart.

642
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,999
I may have to recalibrate
the pneumatic systems as well.

643

00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:43,037
She says if we hold back
the Rehabs
for just two more days,

687
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,122
they won't be able
to make us move.

688
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:46,916
And they'll have to
let my parents go.

689
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,877
And we'll all be together
like family again.

690
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:53,673
Your parents?

691
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:18,531
Murphy, you okay?

692
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,450
Your parents,

693
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:23,035
you miss them?

694
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,206
Yeah.

695
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:33,087
But you remember them.

696
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:38,801
Because if you remember them,

697
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:42,013
they're never really gone.

698
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,244
Hey, Murphy,

699
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:08,914
I'm glad your
new heart works.

700
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,089
I heard voices.

701
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:20,343
Shh.

702
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:24,472
She should be in bed.

703
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:33,314
Could you leave her
just a moment?

704
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:39,403
Of course.

705
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:59,340
<i>Won't be the same, dear</i>

706
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:02,718
<i>If you're not here with me</i>

707
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:07,098
Hey, you gotta pay for that.

708
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,394
Hey!

709
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,066
What are you, deaf?
Son of a...

710
01:02:37,972 --> 01:02:39,747
That's not what we said
we were going to do.

711
01:02:39,832 --> 01:02:41,232
That is, too,
what we were
gonna do.

712
01:02:41,233 --> 01:02:42,975
That's not what we said
we were going to do.

713
01:02:42,976 --> 01:02:44,126
That's where
the Heights is.

714
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:45,110
Right there.
Right there.

715
01:02:45,111 --> 01:02:47,061
Hey, Bertha, you told us
to relocate the weapons,

716
01:02:47,062 --> 01:02:48,363
but where do you
want this thing?

717
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:52,017
My God.

718
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,688
How did you get this?

719
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,441
We stole it from
the police depot. Why?

720
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:01,944
You know this looks
like the exhaust system
from an F-27.

721
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,697
No. It's the prototype
for Robo's flight pack.

722
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,032
The funding ran out
before we got
a chance to test it.

723
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,994
How do you know
so much about it?

724
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:11,745
I designed it.

725
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:18,043
Well, it looks like the odds
on the home team just went up.

726
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:38,481
Okay, now what
I've done is programmed
the command system

727
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:41,025
to take its cues
from your hard drive.

728
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,820
I've also rigged it to work
as an auxiliary power unit.

729
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:48,073
So, if you ever have
a power drain
like you did yesterday,

730
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,950
just interface
with the flight pack

731
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:51,911
and recharge
whether you fly or not.

732
01:03:52,879 --> 01:03:55,414
And, Nikko, you see
those resistors over
there by the ratchet?

733
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,166
Get them for me,
will you?

734
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,043
<i>Get them for me, will you?</i>

735
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:05,466
<i>Get them for me.</i>

736
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,052
<i>Promise me.</i>

737
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,097
<i>Get them for me.</i>

738
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,975
<i>Promise me.</i>

739
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,739
What's goin' on?

740
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,115
Excuse me.

741
01:04:33,245 --> 01:04:34,912
Hey, man,
where you goin'?

742
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,706
Unfinished business.

743
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:46,173
It's okay.
He'll be back.

744
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:47,800
He needs us, too.

745
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:50,469
Where's he going?

746
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,639
To keep a promise.

747
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,935
LEON: Sarge,
you got a Robocop.
You got an alien cop?

748
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,528
Huh? You got
ghost cop?

749
01:04:59,613 --> 01:05:01,455
Leon, I told you,
I don't have time for this.

750
01:05:01,539 --> 01:05:02,539
You got a vampire cop?

751
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:09,572
Murphy.

752
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,365
Good evening,
Sergeant Reed.

753
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:13,784
Do you know
there's a warrant out
for your arrest?

754
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:15,911
Yes.

755
01:05:15,996 --> 01:05:18,539
I was just checkin'.
What can I do for you?

756
01:05:18,999 --> 01:05:21,667
Please direct me
to the Rehab staging area.

757
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:25,004
Well,
it's just down the hall.
You can't miss it.

758
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:27,381
Thank you.

759
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:34,430
You may want to call
the fire department.

760
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,435
<i>MAN ON PA: Quadrants</i>

763
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,109
Hey, you got a light?
Sure, man.

764
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,902
ROBOCOP:
Allow me, scum.

765
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:55,993
MAN: Look out!

766
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:21,810
Shit.

767
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:39,662
Where's McDaggett?

768
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:55,719
<i>He's coming out tonight</i>

769
01:06:55,804 --> 01:06:58,414
<i>ELECTRONlC VOlCE:</i>
<i>That does not look</i>
<i>Iike a poIice station.</i>

770
01:06:58,498 --> 01:07:01,133
McDAGGETT: You're damn right,
I'm not at the police station.

771
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:03,894
If my spy
hadn't warned me,
I'd be dead now.

772
01:07:05,105 --> 01:07:08,691
I thought your damn ninja
was supposed to take care
of Robocop for me.

773
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:11,068
That's the deal.
I clear the area,

774
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:13,112
he keeps the robot
off my back.

775
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:16,657
<i>You have the device</i>
<i>I had sent you?</i>

776
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:24,540
It hasn't come to that yet,
and it won't. Relax.

779
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:34,049
You don't need
to know my methods.

780
01:07:34,134 --> 01:07:37,219
I said I'll clear the area,
and I'll clear it.

781
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,974
Just get the robot cop
off my back.

782
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:56,739
I understand you're
willing to pay good money

783
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:59,324
to know where
the rebel Base Op. is.

784
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,285
Yes, well, um...

785
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:03,871
The money's good,

786
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:07,124
if the tip's good.

787
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,500
Yeah.

788
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:10,210
Well, uh...

789
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:15,758
The last tip saved
your ass, didn't it?

790
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:33,275
Hey, hey,
hey, hey!

791
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,360
What do we have
here, huh?

792
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:38,130
What's the matter?
You don't like a man
in uniform, huh?

793
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:40,616
Look, my dad lost his job.
I just need some money.
That's all.

794
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,576
We got lots
of money, honey.

795
01:08:42,911 --> 01:08:45,287
GIRL: Don't! No!

796
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:46,997
She said, "No"!

797
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:48,373
Huh?

798
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,668
Maybe you have
a hearing problem.

799
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,009
Go home, young lady.

800
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:01,970
You are in violation
of curfew.

801
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:14,733
Where's McDaggett?

802
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,488
Room 21 2.

803
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:20,948
Thank you.

804
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,617
I hope you are insured.

805
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:26,829
Elevator door sticks.

806
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:48,517
Don't.

807
01:10:01,114 --> 01:10:03,615
I have a message
from Officer Lewis.

808
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:20,632
Stop!

809
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:24,511
Drive!

810
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:27,598
I said drive.
Goddammit, drive!

811
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:37,700
...I want my time, my money.

812
01:10:37,784 --> 01:10:39,884
I told you once.
And I'm not going
to tell you again.

813
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:40,869
You understand?

814
01:10:40,953 --> 01:10:43,288
I must commandeer
your vehicle
for police use.

815
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:46,325
What is your
problem, sucker?

816
01:10:49,037 --> 01:10:50,662
I mean, Officer.

817
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:02,985
Cover me!

818
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,580
Commander!

819
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,980
BOY: Hey,
what's the deal,
Robo was shot?

820
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:35,702
Where the hell
is Robocop?

821
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:39,831
We could drive around
and listen for explosions.

822
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:49,341
Hey, are you
doing that?

823
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,926
I got tired
of splicing wires,

824
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:52,761
so I put in
a pulse tach
decoder.

825
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:53,845
A telemetric?

826
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,680
No.
Smart ass.

827
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:57,641
I know you are,
but what am I?

828
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:00,477
Here, let me try it.

829
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:13,657
Thanks for the
heart attack, Coontz.

830
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:16,576
Maybe I will go
and send out a recon team.

831
01:14:17,245 --> 01:14:19,037
I got a better idea.

832
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:22,541
Why don't we just
all have a seat

833
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,668
and relax?

834
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:27,379
It'll all be over
in a few minutes.

835
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:29,506
You son of a bitch.

836
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:30,924
Hey, watch the language.

837
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:33,009
There's children
present, remember?

838
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,056
Drop it, Coontz.

839
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:43,145
I'm not gonna ask twice.

840
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:51,653
What did you mean
about it all being over
in a few minutes?

841
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:57,284
Get the kids
out of here! Now!

842
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:00,996
Where are we going?
Just follow me.

843
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:12,924
Bertha!

844
01:15:13,885 --> 01:15:15,051
No.

845
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,139
Go.

846
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,602
Got to get her.

847
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:24,686
Go.

848
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:28,106
Come on, let's go.
Come on!

849
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:37,199
Now!

850
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,294
Okay, come on.

851
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:56,051
Come on! Get in!
Come on!

852
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:00,138
Come on.

853
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:02,140
MAN: Keep going.

854
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:04,893
Okay. Now go!

855
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,019
Go on!

856
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:08,230
No! It's happening again.

857
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:10,232
Don't let them
take you away.

858
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:18,657
I said go!
Get out of here!

859
01:16:34,382 --> 01:16:35,840
Where is he?

860
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:39,552
Go to hell.

861
01:16:39,637 --> 01:16:41,471
Take her to headquarters.

862
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:43,723
I promise my men
won't leave a mark on you.

863
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:47,560
MAN 1: Let's go.
We got 'em all.

864
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:52,857
Sir, what about
our friend Coontz?

865
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,529
Well, if we'd let him live,
we'd have to have paid him.

866
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:01,992
<i>MAN 2 OVER MEGAPHONE:</i>
<i>This buiIding is now</i>
<i>under OCP jurisdiction.</i>

867
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:10,208
We are talking about
hundreds of thousands
of dollars in damage.

868
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:12,168
So Murphy can be
rough on properties.

869
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:13,670
Yes, well,

870
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:17,340
every cent of it
will be coming out
of your salaries.

871
01:17:17,425 --> 01:17:19,551
Hey, you built him.

872
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:29,769
Sergeant, we're taking
Cadillac Heights.

873
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:33,273
I'll need 50 of your men
armed and in full-body armor
in one hour.

874
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:36,276
Mr. Johnson,
you can tell the CEO
the demolition crews

875
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,154
will have total access
at 0600 hours
tomorrow morning.

876
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:42,866
Hey, we don't do
that kind of work.

877
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:45,285
That was a direct order,
Sergeant.

878
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:48,788
Driving people
out of their homes
is no work for a cop!

879
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:51,333
Now, Sergeant,

880
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:54,419
1 5 years on the force
is quite an investment.

881
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:56,838
Your job, your pension.

882
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:59,883
Maybe instead of worrying
about these squatter people,

883
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:02,093
you might think
about your own family.

884
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:04,179
I am.

885
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:16,358
I'm thinking I have
to go home and face them.

886
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:34,292
You can't do this!

887
01:18:36,796 --> 01:18:40,965
Look, you are
employees of OCP.
Now remember that!

888
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:46,346
You're jeopardizing
your retirement benefits.

889
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:00,652
Stop that man.

01:22:55,929 --> 01:22:58,931

to blow you out
of your neighborhood.

924
01:22:59,016 --> 01:23:00,683
I want you
to take your kids

925
01:23:00,768 --> 01:23:03,770
and anybody who shouldn't
be fighting to the basement.

926
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,898
The rest of you
are hereby deputized

927
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,317

928
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:13,863

how real cops kick ass.

01:24:30,357 --> 01:24:31,524
Detroit Police.

930
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:33,276
Identify yourself.

931
01:24:38,866 --> 01:24:42,452
You are under arrest
for assaulting an officer.

932
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:55,339
And destruction
of police property.

933
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:38,299

934
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:46,390

937

against us.

938
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:21,736
So? We have
a schedule to keep.

939
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:23,821
We don't fire
on police officers!

940
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:25,698
You're out of line,
McDaggett.

941
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:28,200
I'm still in charge here.
I'm pulling the plug!

942
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:29,911
Sit down.

943
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:31,746
What, you've gone
war wacky?

944
01:27:35,042 --> 01:27:37,710
I said, sit down.

945
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:42,089

947
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:50,848

How did you get...

950
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:59,065
No, never mind. Did you see
a transmission dish outside?

951
01:27:59,149 --> 01:28:02,610
Yeah,

Media Break guy pick his nose.

1022
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:49,219
He said
you're fired.

1023
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:20,459
Well, I got to
hand it to you.

1024

1026
01:37:25,757 --> 01:37:27,883
