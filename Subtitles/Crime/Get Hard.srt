This right here is

did you ever get raped
for failing a test?

726
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,751

this will be your cell.

The key to survival
in prison

747
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:08,832
lies in the following
simple questions:

Are you hard?
And can you handle yourself?

is a resounding yes.

So the idea is that
I make a face

765
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:46,703
that conveys the fact that
