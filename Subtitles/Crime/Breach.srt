00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:51,518
Sir, you could fall.

176
00:14:52,644 --> 00:14:54,562
(MOCKINGLY)
I won't fall.

177
00:14:55,522 --> 00:14:57,440
I'm very coordinated.

178
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:02,903
Trying to re-route
a phone line to get
Internet access.

179
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:05,114
I can get an IT guy in here
to do that for you, sir.

180
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:13,997
My Lord, you are as dumb as
a bag of hammers, aren't you?

181
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,710
Yes, let's bring in
an IT guy,

182
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,837
making $35,000 a year,

183
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,882
and give him access
to hard drives

184
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,718
that a foreign agent
would pay millions for.

185
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:32,389
We're supposed to be
protecting the Bureau
from electronic infiltration.

186
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:41,063
So, what kind of
sites do you like?

187
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:44,608
On the Internet.
Are there sites...
Why?

188
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,609
I don't know, just...

189
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:48,862
I've never seen anyone
stand on top of their desk
to get online before.

190
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:54,492
Do you pray the rosary
every day?

191
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:56,286
Hmm?

192
00:15:56,327 --> 00:16:00,248
Your file says
you prepped at Gonzaga,
with the Jesuits.

193
00:16:00,623 --> 00:16:01,666
That's right. I did.

194
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:05,920
So, do you pray
the rosary every day?

195
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:08,338
Not every day, no.

196
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:10,173
You should.

197
00:16:13,051 --> 00:16:14,511
You still want
my list, sir?

198
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,679
The five things?

199
00:16:20,892 --> 00:16:22,810
These are the greatest
pens in the world.

200
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:25,396
I would never write
with anything else.

201
00:16:30,609 --> 00:16:31,651
Sure.

202
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,530
I won Boy Scout merit
badges in every category
except riflery.

203
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,491
I haven't been to confession
since high school.

204
00:16:38,574 --> 00:16:40,535
There are several words
I constantly misspell.

205
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:43,037
My favorite drink
is a vodka tonic.

206
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:45,706
And I'm the only male
in the last four
generations of my family

207
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:47,583
who hasn't served
in the military.

208
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,711
What is your drink then?

209
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:52,462
Gin?

210
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:54,547
Scotch.

211
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:59,886
It's against Bureau policy
for an agent to consume
alcohol, even off-duty.

212
00:17:00,344 --> 00:17:02,054
Did you know that?
Yes, I did.

213
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:05,808
Because an FBI agent
is never off-duty.

214
00:17:07,768 --> 00:17:09,853
That comes from
Director Freeh.

215
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,855
We attend the same church.

Who's the pager for?

217
00:17:13,523 --> 00:17:14,524
My wife.

218
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,360
She likes to know she can
get a hold of me 24l7.

219
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,278
Mmm.

220
00:17:21,197 --> 00:17:22,615
She a Catholic girl?

221
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:25,951
No. Sort of a lapsed
Protestant, actually.

222
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,537
She's East German.

223
00:17:28,745 --> 00:17:30,664
Big fan of Christmas
plays, though.

224
00:17:40,381 --> 00:17:44,343
Have to do something
about that, won't we?

Huh?

230

Last I looked, she hadn't
been read into the case.
Can she hear this?

00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,379
No.

Uh-huh.

Agent Burroughs, I don't know
what I'm supposed to be
looking for with this guy.

236
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:34,347
It's not like he's gonna
bring a train of hookers
through the office.

237
00:18:34,723 --> 00:18:36,391
Just get me my pages.

There are a couple of people
like that at work.

They think I'm a

get a copy of...
It was ignored, I'm sure.

Yes, it was.

260
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,103
That's because
you don't shoot.

261
00:20:57,437 --> 00:20:59,647
The FBI is a gun culture.

262
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,149
You can't advance here
unless you're part of it.

263
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:06,070
Every director in the history
of the Bureau has come from
the law enforcement side.

The guys who shoot,
the guys who make arrests.

265

There's never
been a director
from the Intel side.

Huh?

All those years, why didn't
you transfer into something
with a higher profile?

271
00:21:22,126 --> 00:21:24,962
Because I never cared
about making headlines.

272
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:26,880
I wanted to make history.
Sorry.

273
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:31,927

are the ones who want to
wipe America off the map.

a little more to me
than being promoted.

we got a call from Photo,
about a portrait sitting.

You're going up on the

God expects you
to live your faith, Eric,

of women in pantsuits.

You do?

293
00:22:53,418 --> 00:22:55,128
Men wear pants.

The world doesn't need
any more Hillary Clintons.

I wrote a program
last night using nothing
but ones and zeroes

if I could do it.

00:23:18,024 --> 00:23:20,151
Okay, help us.
What do we do?

300
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:30,619
First, we drop ACS,
which is a relic.

301
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,621
There's not nearly
enough bandwidth.

302
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:34,372
That's why
you've got agents

303
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:37,250
who still keep
sensitive information
in cardboard boxes.

304
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:42,380
You need to move
to an ATM system
instead of the WAN.

throughout the building.

Dynamic IP addresses
to hide the system using
the Invicta prototype.

310
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:04,316
Would it be easier
if I sent this in a memo?

311
00:24:04,358 --> 00:24:07,236
Yes, it would.
Fine. On your desk
in the morning.

312
00:24:07,694 --> 00:24:09,613
You're gonna set up
meetings for me

00:24:09,696 --> 00:24:14,159
with the appropriate
systems managers
at the CIA, DIA, NSA,

314
00:24:14,242 --> 00:24:16,494
and the intel agencies
of each armed service.

315
00:24:16,536 --> 00:24:17,662
Yes, sir.

316
00:24:17,745 --> 00:24:20,790
They're all
ahead of us on IT.
We have to study them.

317

Would you mind if we
book those appointments
through me, Bob?

318
00:24:25,336 --> 00:24:26,628
What for?

319
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:28,213
Just protocol.

320
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,590
Of course.

321
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:32,217
And then we switch
offices, right?

322
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:34,177
Sure.

323
00:24:34,302 --> 00:24:37,388
Perfect.
We're fighting crime
with 19th-century technology,

324
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,390
and he's worried
about protocol.

325
00:24:39,932 --> 00:24:42,685
Set up those meetings.
Leave it up to him,
they'll never happen.

326
00:24:42,768 --> 00:24:43,769
Sir?

327
00:24:43,853 --> 00:24:46,063
That was turf protection
you were just watching
in there.

328
00:24:46,146 --> 00:24:48,982
Didn't you spot it?
Organizational arrogance.

329
00:24:49,024 --> 00:24:51,568
"No, we don't want to learn
anything from the CIA.

330
00:24:51,651 --> 00:24:53,153
"We want the CIA
answering to us."

331
00:24:55,488 --> 00:24:57,198
You know what's going on
behind that door?

332
00:24:57,323 --> 00:24:58,449
No, sir.

333
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:02,536
Analysts looking
for a spy inside the
intelligence community.

334
00:25:02,703 --> 00:25:04,079
Highest clearance.

335
00:25:04,163 --> 00:25:07,249
But there aren't any
CIA officers in there.
You know why?

336
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:10,377
Because it's a CIA officer
we're trying to build
a case against.

337
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:14,255
Now, could the mole be
someone from the Bureau
and not the CIA?

338
00:25:14,339 --> 00:25:15,298
Of course.

339
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:17,050
Are we actively pursuing
that possibility?

340
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:18,259
Of course not.

341
00:25:18,343 --> 00:25:20,845
'Cause we're the Bureau,
and the Bureau knows all.

342
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:32,439
Cooperation is
counter-operational.
And that's the mentality.

343
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:35,692
Of course, the enemies
of this country
aren't so picky.

344
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:38,820
They'll work with anyone
who shares their hatred of us.

345
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:41,864
Bureau hasn't learned
that lesson yet.

346
00:25:51,748 --> 00:25:54,334
He keeps some paintings
in a conference room on 8.

347
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:55,835
I want you to get
one of them for me.

348
00:25:56,794 --> 00:26:00,047
Sir?
It's two men on a boat.
I want it.

349
00:26:01,215 --> 00:26:04,093
What? You mean Agent Garces?
These are his paintings.

350
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:05,886
Stop thinking
like a clerk.

351
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,638
They're sitting
in storage.

352
00:26:08,555 --> 00:26:10,474

353
00:26:13,643 --> 00:26:16,229
BURROUGHS: Okay.
Where was Hanssen
on March 7, 1991?

354
00:26:16,312 --> 00:26:19,482
The file has him
making a drop at Ellis
at 6:30 p.m.

355
00:26:22,443 --> 00:26:27,072
He badged in at 8:27 a.m.
Badged out at 12:45.

356
00:26:27,156 --> 00:26:29,825
Badged back in at 1:45,

357
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,369
and badged out again at 5:36.

358
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:35,955
Okay. Let's take a look
at August 12, 1993.

359
00:26:42,628 --> 00:26:45,506
You know why the Soviet
Empire collapsed?

360
00:26:48,383 --> 00:26:49,718

361
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,803
I made a career
studying them.

362
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:53,972
They were smarter
than us.

363
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,558
More devious,
more determined.

364
00:26:58,393 --> 00:27:00,144
So why did they fail?

365
00:27:03,397 --> 00:27:04,899
Godlessness.

366
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,443
Atheism.

367
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,031
I'm on my way
to morning Mass.

368
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:14,824
You do remember
what Mass is, yes?

369
00:27:15,366 --> 00:27:18,369
The Jesuits at Gonzaga
taught you that much,
didn't they?

370
00:27:18,411 --> 00:27:20,163
Sir, my grandfather
was a deacon.

371
00:27:22,915 --> 00:27:24,959
Well, congratulations.

372
00:27:26,418 --> 00:27:28,670
Now it's time
to join the varsity.

373
00:27:32,591 --> 00:27:36,427
I saw a woman from
Planned Parenthood
on television this morning.

374
00:27:37,178 --> 00:27:40,348
A lesbian, naturally.
Defending gay marriage.

375
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:44,310
I almost ripped the cable
out of the wall.

376
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:47,354
Bet she was
wearing pants, huh?

377
00:27:53,318 --> 00:27:56,696
Will your children
be Jesuit-taught,
as you were?

378
00:27:57,864 --> 00:28:01,576
I don't know yet.
That conversation's
still a few years away.

379
00:28:02,076 --> 00:28:03,202
It shouldn't be.

380
00:28:03,285 --> 00:28:04,537
Sir, I'm GS-11.

381
00:28:04,578 --> 00:28:06,538
We need a second salary
before we can start having...

382
00:28:06,622 --> 00:28:09,041
What is money
compared with
the blessings of family?

Tell me.

384
00:28:11,293 --> 00:28:13,670
My wife was the one...
Good to see you, Bob.

385
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,383
It was my wife
who first brought me here.

386
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:19,425
Bonnie.

387
00:28:20,384 --> 00:28:23,971
I was a Lutheran when we met,
and not much of one.

388
00:28:24,763 --> 00:28:26,682
She saved my life.

Latin service,

family lunch after.

might like that?

No one else
even has this number.

Well, perhaps
you should give her a call.
It might be important.

he would trust me

410

518
00:38:06,046 --> 00:38:07,256
It's bullshit.

519
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:09,216
The whole thing,
it's Kenneth Starr
all over again,

520
00:38:09,299 --> 00:38:12,511
except I'm running around
looking for the blue dress.

521
00:38:14,763 --> 00:38:16,973
You've come to
admire him, I see.

522
00:38:18,016 --> 00:38:19,142
Yes.

523
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:20,768
Respect him?

524
00:38:21,227 --> 00:38:22,186
Yes.

525
00:38:23,938 --> 00:38:25,564
Well, that was
inevitable.

526
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,817
For our purposes,
it was sort of necessary.

527
00:38:30,777 --> 00:38:32,237
But he's a traitor, Eric.

528
00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:37,158
He started spying
for the Russians,
we think, in 1985.

529
00:38:40,536 --> 00:38:44,039
He's given them
military secrets,
intelligence secrets.

530
00:38:44,999 --> 00:38:47,292
He gave them our
Continuity of Government
Program,

531
00:38:47,376 --> 00:38:49,002
which told them
where the President
would be taken

532
00:38:49,086 --> 00:38:51,088
during a nuclear
or terrorist attack.

533
00:38:51,171 --> 00:38:55,050
And the Vice President.
And the Congress.
And the Cabinet.

534
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:59,637
The damage he's done
to the U.S. Government
is in the billions.

535
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,597
But that's just
the money part.

536
00:39:01,681 --> 00:39:03,641
He's also
given up lives.

is also true.

551
00:39:54,062 --> 00:39:55,772
Irrelevant, but true.

552
00:39:56,231 --> 00:39:58,316

they're about his wife.

555

He's a big fan
of strippers, too.
Has been for years.

556
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:16,124
But his grandchildren
do love him.

557
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:19,210
That part I can't argue.

558
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:22,838
There's no such thing as
the "Information Assurance

559
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:24,089
No.

560
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:27,009
We created that

from State.

566
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,985
Unusual steps
were required.

stopped at his dry cleaners,

574

If it deals with Russian

any leave time coming?

576

579
00:41:29,107 --> 00:41:31,860
Director's running the case.
He sees your pages every day.

580
00:41:31,943 --> 00:41:32,944
No.

581
00:41:33,028 --> 00:41:33,987
Yes.

582
00:41:34,863 --> 00:41:36,364
Keep them coming,
by the way.

583
00:41:36,447 --> 00:41:39,534
Our audio's missing about 90%
of what Hanssen says in there.

584
00:41:39,617 --> 00:41:40,910
He mumbles.

585
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,329
He does a lot of things,
this guy.

586
00:41:44,038 --> 00:41:47,541
Why don't we just
arrest him?
Can't do that.

587
00:41:47,624 --> 00:41:50,836
He knows the names
and locations of every source
we've ever turned.

588
00:41:51,211 --> 00:41:53,880
If we can't get him to talk,
their lives are all at risk.

Dean Plesac.

in charge.
Sir.

591
00:41:58,885 --> 00:42:01,470
Director wants him
caught in the act
of making a drop.

592
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:03,347
That would give you
the death penalty.

593
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:04,974
Don't you think
he's earned it?

594
00:42:05,057 --> 00:42:07,851
See you, Dean.
Thanks for coming in, Rich.

595
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:10,812

take nothing personally.

597
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:18,653
He's got an appointment
at the DIA tomorrow
at 2:00, right?

598
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:20,363
Yeah.
You're driving him?

599
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,739
Yeah.
Good.

600
00:42:21,822 --> 00:42:24,033
We need him out of the office
for at least three hours.

00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:26,285
That's when we'll be
sweeping his car.
Okay.

00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,997
How long will it take you
to download the data card
off his Palm Pilot?

603
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,958
Twenty, 30 minutes,
depending on the level
of encryption.

604
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,752
But you can't.
He never lets it
out of his sight.

605
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:40,548
Assuming we can separate him
from it, 20 to 30 minutes.

606
00:42:40,631 --> 00:42:41,841
Okay.

607
00:42:49,348 --> 00:42:50,474
What's this?

608
00:42:50,682 --> 00:42:52,184
You want to be
read in, right?

609
00:42:55,728 --> 00:42:57,021
Wait.

610
00:42:58,231 --> 00:43:00,149
What if he's smarter
than I am?

611
00:43:03,569 --> 00:43:06,321
I've never misread anybody
this badly before.

612
00:43:08,615 --> 00:43:09,908
Except maybe you.

613
00:43:13,995 --> 00:43:15,580
A couple of years ago,

614
00:43:16,748 --> 00:43:19,750
the Bureau put together
a task force.

615
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:24,505
Lots of assets
had been disappearing.

616
00:43:25,381 --> 00:43:29,509
Sources like Motorin,
Martynov. Dozens of them,
vanishing.

617
00:43:29,551 --> 00:43:34,180
So this task force was
formed to find the mole
who was giving them up.

618
00:43:34,347 --> 00:43:38,017
Our best analysts poring
over data for years
looking for the guy,

619
00:43:38,101 --> 00:43:40,978
and they could never
quite find him.

620
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:46,358
Guess who we put in charge
of the task force?

621
00:43:51,613 --> 00:43:53,365
He was smarter
than all of us.

622
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,579
Actually,
I can live with that part.

623
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,499
It's the idea
that my entire career
has been a waste of time,

624
00:44:03,582 --> 00:44:04,959
that's the part I hate.

625
00:44:05,584 --> 00:44:07,711
Everything I've done
since I got to this office,

626
00:44:07,795 --> 00:44:10,881
everything we've
all been paid to do,
he was undoing it.

627
00:44:11,506 --> 00:44:13,425

stayed home.

can't eat Chinese
every night, Eric.

it would be okay, Eric.

bumping her head?

Maybe you want me
to be someone else, too.

704

Maybe you want me to be
Bonnie or something.

705

No, that'd be easier
for you, wouldn't it?

every day and wanted to spend
my life being pregnant...

Your parents would
probably love that.

711
00:48:58,895 --> 00:49:00,855
Enough.
Then you wouldn't have
to worry anymore

712

you been out here?

your father say?

726
00:50:12,546 --> 00:50:14,881
Nothing.
He just shrugged.

That's what he said to me
the first time I shipped out.

He knew I was scared,
so he just kept it simple.

Maybe I should have
gone to Annapolis.

obviously. My wife.

1197
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:52,327
She's trying to reach me
because I told her
I'd be home by now,

1198
01:24:52,369 --> 01:24:53,703
and because we're
in another fight,

1199
01:24:53,828 --> 01:24:55,538
caused by you,
as usual.

1200
01:24:57,373 --> 01:25:00,209
Thanks for dropping by
unannounced and lecturing her
about Opus Dei.

1201
01:25:00,251 --> 01:25:01,502
That was real helpful.

1202
01:25:01,836 --> 01:25:04,129
Oh, and thanks for staring
at her in church
like she was from Mars.

1203

You were testing her, too.

1206
01:25:13,930 --> 01:25:17,100

she asked me this morning
why you're like this.
