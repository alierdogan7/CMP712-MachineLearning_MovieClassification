1
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,530
Hey, Ebony!
Ebony!

2
00:01:26,732 --> 00:01:29,667
Hey, Ebony!
Open up!

3
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:32,561
Jesus, Ebony,
get this guy out of here!

4
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:34,238
There's no more room,
Ebony.

5
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,001
We've got to use this cell.
Cool it, or there'll be trouble!

6
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:42,413
l'll kill Dagger!

7
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,815
Lula was gonna knife him in
the back, the son of a bitch!

8
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:48,919
''Was''?
l still will!

9
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:54,423
Dagger! l'll kill you, you hear?
Stick you like a pig.

10
00:01:55,394 --> 00:02:00,331
Ebony, Lula's freaked out,
says it 's his right to kill Dagger.

11
00:02:00,532 --> 00:02:03,262
Lula needs to be taught a lesson!

12
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:09,031
Whatever's happened, it 's not for
you to decide, you little shit!

13
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:10,640
Dagger's gonna die!

14
00:02:10,842 --> 00:02:11,831
Gonna die! Gonna die!

15
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:14,638
Calm down!

16
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:22,876
So you think you're gonna decide this,
Pimenta? Come on, then, l'm ready.

17
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:24,487
Shut up, Dagger!

18
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:28,552
Gonna die! Gonna die!

19
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,957
Like l said, l've got no one
waiting for me on the outside.

20
00:02:32,164 --> 00:02:34,223
l'm in no hurry to get out.

21
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:36,196
Anyone wants a fight,
let 's get on with it.

22
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:38,596
l'll crush all of you.

23
00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:41,739
So what are we
waiting for?

24
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,740
What the fuck's wrong with
you guys?! Let 's cool it, here!

25
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:48,306
What 's going on, Dagger?

26
00:02:48,513 --> 00:02:50,845
Lula attacked him from behind,
Ebony! He's a bad ass!

27
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:54,815
-He was within his rights!
-He went for Dagger from behind!

28
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,250
Right out of line, man!

29
00:02:57,456 --> 00:02:58,548
Let 's cool it,
man, calm down!

30
00:02:58,757 --> 00:03:00,987
''Calm down'', my ass.
He's gonna die!

31
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,827
Gonna die!

32
00:03:07,032 --> 00:03:08,727
Gonna die!

33
00:03:08,934 --> 00:03:12,836
-You locking me in there, Ebony?
-First get in there, then speak!

34
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:16,868
-Don't throw Dagger in here, Ebony!
-We don't want trouble.

35
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:18,736
Get the hell out, damn it!

36
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:25,209
So? l'm all ears.
How come he's so mad at you?

37
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:30,411
You heard, Lula came out of nowhere
with a knife and tried to kill me.

38
00:03:30,622 --> 00:03:35,025
l dodged, and we scuffled
till they broke us up.

39
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:39,122
The rest you know.

40
00:03:55,313 --> 00:03:57,372
Good morning, Mr. Pires.

41
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:01,079
l do apologize for this
disgusting behavior...

42
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:05,517
which has invaded
our household today.

43
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:13,996
Only this idiot Lula, a young,
inexperienced con...

44
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:18,158
suddenly got this attitude, without
even asking permission!

45
00:04:18,436 --> 00:04:21,496
Dagger killed my father!
He killed my father! lt was him!

46
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:23,435
l sure did, kid.

47
00:04:23,642 --> 00:04:27,305
And not only him,
l've killed plenty more besides!

48
00:04:27,512 --> 00:04:30,037
Ebony!
Mr. Pires!

49
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:32,780
Dagger killed my father
in front of my mother.

50
00:04:32,984 --> 00:04:35,817
He's been telling everyone he
recognized her on Visitors Day.

51
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:39,684
You gonna deny that, asshole?!
Are you gonna deny it? Are you?

52
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:41,415
Ebony, please.

53
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:42,615
What?

54
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:46,559
Tell the kid he doesn't know
half the story. lf he did...

55
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:49,097
Son of a bitch!
l'll kill you!

56
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:54,068
Tell him to ask his mother if she
was really as upset as all that.

57
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:57,901
Or was it a relief when l came
and grabbed his belt from him?

58
00:04:58,109 --> 00:04:59,576
Lies! That 's a lie!

59
00:04:59,778 --> 00:05:02,303
Like hell it is!

60
00:05:02,514 --> 00:05:05,244
l saw it for myself.

61
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:08,885
He'd have
thrashed her to death!

62
00:05:12,657 --> 00:05:14,750
Hey, Lula!

63
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:18,685
l thought you'd have
heard by now, kid!

64
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:23,597
Your mother paid me
to kill your father!

65
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,003
Get it now?

66
00:05:28,473 --> 00:05:31,670
lt was your mother wiped him out!

67
00:05:56,735 --> 00:05:59,169
Hear that?

68
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:04,201
He's calmed down!

69
00:06:13,018 --> 00:06:14,849
He's calmed down!

70
00:06:16,187 --> 00:06:19,384
l want them both out
here in their underwear.

71
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:49,313
Hey, Lula...

72
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:53,218
as far as l'm concerned,
we're quits.

73
00:06:56,861 --> 00:06:59,022
Let 's forget it, shall we?

74
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:09,471
You've put me to shame, and on the
day of the doctor's first visit.

75
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:19,880
So, Lula, what brought
you back in here?

76
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:24,419
l left here, went home and found
my wife in bed with someone else.

77
00:07:24,923 --> 00:07:27,391
The son of a bitch had the
nerve to tell me, ''That 's life''.

78
00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:29,787
l shot him three times just
to prove the contrary.

79
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:35,591
You should know that whatever goes
on outside gets settled outside.

80
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:40,598
ln here,
anyone who behaves...

81
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:43,774
knows we'll do what we can
to show him the front door...

82
00:07:43,975 --> 00:07:46,603
where his family is waiting.

83
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:51,578
But anyone who's proud of being
a criminal, with blood in his eye...

84
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:54,975
we'll do everything to
prolong his life in here!

85
00:07:56,621 --> 00:08:00,216
We usually forget people
like that in here.

86
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:08,427
Doctor, this is Ebony.

87
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:15,104
Yes, Doctor,
Ebony's got a problem.

88
00:08:16,674 --> 00:08:20,542
My kitchen knife
is still missing!

89
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,110
Whoever took it,
l'll give you one chance...

90
00:08:24,315 --> 00:08:28,115
return it, or there'll be
one prisoner dead every day!

91
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:34,081
l'd like to ask our visitors
to turn their backs...

92
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:37,887
since there's an ashamed
crook present.

93
00:08:38,096 --> 00:08:39,723
But...

94
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:42,126
when l turn around...

95
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,700
l sure would like
to see that knife.

96
00:08:46,838 --> 00:08:49,204
l'll count to three.

97
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,204
One...

98
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:53,434
two...

99
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:56,739
l'm turning...

100
00:08:58,316 --> 00:09:00,614
Three!

101
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:11,793
-From your kitchen?
-Yes, sir!

102
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,794
This is the yellow wing, Doctor,
because they're afraid.

103
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:19,299
lt 's like a jail within the jail.

104
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:22,439
They're locked up here for their
own safety. They're scared.

105
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,838
Career killers, rapists, stool
pigeons, bad payers.

106
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:29,309
ln here, you know,
prisoners never forgive.

107
00:09:29,514 --> 00:09:34,008
Mr. Pires, don't these people
ever get sun? lt 's so musty!

108
00:09:36,955 --> 00:09:41,187
Anyone want to go outside?
Take a walk in the yard?

109
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:44,685
Get some fresh air?

110
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:59,867
Mr. Pires, what do these
people do all day?

111
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:03,445
They come and go all day long,
think they're busy...

112
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:05,843
but it gets them nowhere.

113
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,019
Doctor, 7,OOO men in jail!

114
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,688
There are 1,8OO
in this pavilion alone.

115
00:10:12,123 --> 00:10:15,957
lf they knew how AlDS is spread,
that 'd already help.

116
00:10:16,161 --> 00:10:19,460
They catch the disease, then have
sex with their wife, girlfriend...

117
00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:20,926
so there's no stopping
the epidemic.

118
00:10:21,132 --> 00:10:24,795
The only ones who'll listen to your
advice are the really smart ones...

119
00:10:25,003 --> 00:10:28,302
who only want to get out alive
in order to keep robbing.

120
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:29,598
That 's their whole life.

121
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:34,301
Maybe. But they're living
at the center of the disease.

122
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:36,241
They're the prisoners here.

123
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:39,575
Prisoners? They own this jail.
The only reason...

124
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:41,752
this place doesn't explode
is because they don't want it to.

125
00:10:42,387 --> 00:10:44,446
God bless you, child.

126
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:50,150
l didn't know you had a family.

127
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:53,922
l thought l'd lost it.

128
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:57,829
My whole life in jail, but even
so, l raised 18 kids...

129
00:10:58,036 --> 00:11:00,834
and not one of them has even been
near a police station.

130
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:06,467
That girl, my youngest, she said
she no longer remembers my face...

131
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:09,647
so she's decided
to come and visit.

132
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:13,840
l'd like you to authorize
me to see her...

133
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:15,246
on a day other than Visitors Day.

134
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:18,251
l don't want my daughter
around all the scum.

135
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,485
That 's going to be tricky.

136
00:11:21,693 --> 00:11:25,561
What if the 7,OOO others
ask me the same thing?

137
00:11:26,397 --> 00:11:28,957
Excuse me.

138
00:11:33,905 --> 00:11:35,770
Good morning!

139
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:56,592
Need anything, Doctor?
Coffee, sugar, chocolate?

140
00:11:56,794 --> 00:11:58,659
Soap, toothpaste?

141
00:11:58,863 --> 00:12:01,798
Joints are only two packs
of Marlboros each. Want one?

142
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,834
-l don't smoke.
-Too bad. Commerce, Doctor!

143
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:08,801
Makes the world go round!

144
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:14,668
Easy now...

145
00:12:15,546 --> 00:12:17,707
that 's it.

146
00:12:25,823 --> 00:12:27,882
He can't spit there.

147
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:30,424
Tuberculosis. Anyone steps
on that spreads the disease.

148
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:36,731
Doctor, if he had the strength,
he'd go to the sink.

149
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:39,562
lt 's not easy.

150
00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:43,036
He must be isolated.

151
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:45,709
But where, Doctor?

152
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:55,181
-Name?
-Everyone calls me The Beard.

153
00:12:57,722 --> 00:13:00,156
Why are you here?

154
00:13:00,358 --> 00:13:01,882
Well...

155
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:04,517
my brother was killed.

156
00:13:04,729 --> 00:13:09,757
Two days later, the murderer
had a little meeting with death...

157
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:15,462
so suspicions fell upon my
good self. Some said l did it...

158
00:13:15,673 --> 00:13:19,200
and others came along and
said they saw it wasn't me.

159
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,937
So what with some saying it was
me and others saying not...

160
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:24,774
here l am, five years now...

161
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:28,711
waiting for the judge to decide.

162
00:13:29,087 --> 00:13:33,285
So, Beard, do you have
sex here in jail?

163
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:36,359
Anyone who denies that is a liar.

164
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:38,654
Use condoms?

165
00:13:38,863 --> 00:13:40,694
lf l've got one, l do.

166
00:13:40,898 --> 00:13:43,128
-lV drugs?
-How dare you, Doctor?!

167
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:46,326
l wonder, Beard!
What 's that mark on your arm?

168
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:55,140
Beard's next!

169
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:12,287
My name's Alipio.

170
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:17,630
Do you use drugs?

171
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:18,961
Needles?

172
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:24,972
No way, Doctor, l got AlDS from
all the ass l've had in jail.

173
00:14:25,543 --> 00:14:27,204
Plenty of ass.

174
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:33,973
ls it still worth
taking the test?

175
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:42,220
l listen, give advice, a little
tenderness, hold them tight...

176
00:14:42,427 --> 00:14:45,521
and then they always give us
something nice in return...

177
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:50,463
a pack of cigarettes, some candy,
a slice of cheese.

178
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:53,865
So many men shut up
in here, Doctor...

179
00:14:54,071 --> 00:14:56,631
without our feminine support.

180
00:14:56,841 --> 00:14:59,674
Yeah, l've got AlDS, Doctor,
but l didn't get it in here.

181
00:14:59,877 --> 00:15:03,313
l brought it in off the streets,
Doctor, and l can't complain.

182
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:08,679
You come in here sick and they
treat you with respect, dignity...

183
00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:11,184
and that 's the greatest thing
in a crook's life.

184
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:13,549
l'm a junky and dealer.

185
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:16,750
ln my business, if a guy doesn't
pay up, l can't take back...

186
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:21,057
what l sold him. The bastard's
already smoked it, snorted it.

187
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:27,932
l take whatever he's got, and
if he's got nothing, l kill him.

188
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:30,731
The other day, l tried to get an
extra banana from the guy who...

189
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:35,709
delivers lunch. The bastard
said only if l kissed his banana.

190
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:38,538
So what the hell,
l'm just crazy about bananas.

191
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:43,186
Doctor, everyone in my cell's
got this itch. lt 's unbearable.

192
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:47,889
Scabies. l'll give
you some medicine.

193
00:15:48,693 --> 00:15:51,423
So how are you getting along?

194
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:56,123
Doctor, after shooting cocaine
in the dark with a blunt needle...

195
00:15:56,334 --> 00:16:02,000
drawing blood with this rig
is hardly fair play, Doctor.

196
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:05,136
Too bad!

197
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:42,796
-Who are you?
-l'm the Doctor.

198
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,298
l was in the infirmary
taking blood samples.

199
00:18:45,503 --> 00:18:47,471
Just ask...

200
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:50,436
Oh sure, like you have
to tell me who to ask!

201
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:52,905
l'm calling the duty officer.

202
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,578
Wait here.
lf no one can identify you...

203
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,578
you're staying
right where you are.

204
00:19:24,308 --> 00:19:25,570
Don't take it personally, Doctor.

205
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:29,906
lt 's their job to escape
and mine not to let them.

206
00:19:38,923 --> 00:19:41,255
Doctor!

207
00:19:43,227 --> 00:19:45,058
You coming back?

208
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:05,375
<i>I knew many of those men hadn't</i>
<i>shown theIrvIctIms any mercy</i>...

209
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:10,452
<i>but socIety has its judges</i>.
<i>And Iwasn't one of them</i>.

210
00:20:10,654 --> 00:20:13,817
<i>At the same tIme</i>,
<i>what dId I have to do with aII that</i>?

211
00:20:14,024 --> 00:20:19,155
<i>I had two choIces</i>;
<i>forget or go back</i>.

212
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:23,795
Take a deep breath.

213
00:20:25,703 --> 00:20:28,968
-Smoker?
-Just cigarettes, Doctor.

214
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:31,733
-No crack?
-Never.

215
00:20:31,942 --> 00:20:33,773
Sleep well?

216
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:36,208
Hardly, Doctor.
The mind never stops...

217
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:38,540
what with one guy trying
to settle a score outside...

218
00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:42,515
another collecting a debt,
another trying to dig a tunnel.

219
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,551
And there goes another day.

220
00:20:44,755 --> 00:20:46,780
You still got much time to do?

221
00:20:46,991 --> 00:20:49,050
A few more years.

222
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,559
-And why did you come here?
-Legitimate self-defense, Doctor.

223
00:20:52,763 --> 00:20:53,752
That lands you
in jail nowadays?

224
00:20:53,964 --> 00:20:58,264
lt did in my case.
Here's what happened, Doctor.

225
00:20:58,469 --> 00:21:03,372
lt was Christmas, the bells
ringing, snow in the windows.

226
00:21:03,574 --> 00:21:09,535
Me, Bristles and Fatso arranged
to do a jewelry store job.

227
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:16,175
Neat work, Doctor.
Never even fired a shot.

228
00:21:16,387 --> 00:21:17,411
The problem was later.

229
00:21:57,428 --> 00:21:59,794
How are we going to split it up?

230
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:02,022
Fatso and l will make three
piles, and you choose first.

231
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:08,327
Son, not now.

232
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:11,702
Get out! Go on!

233
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:36,154
You fucking moron!
We're splitting the loot...

234
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:39,393
and you come at me with
your hand covered?

235
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:46,734
lt 's his own fault he died.

236
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:51,437
What the fuck's going on?

237
00:22:51,782 --> 00:22:57,118
So you shot him in the heat of
the moment, but we'd agreed...

238
00:22:57,321 --> 00:23:01,485
for me to shoot you,
so we could take your share.

239
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:04,286
So shoot!

240
00:23:07,064 --> 00:23:09,555
Go on, fire away!

241
00:23:12,836 --> 00:23:14,963
l can't, damn it.

242
00:23:15,172 --> 00:23:17,868
Give me your rod.

243
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,243
Oh my God!

244
00:23:29,486 --> 00:23:34,651
Being betrayed by your buddy for
nothing, Doctor...

245
00:23:34,858 --> 00:23:39,886
like Judas, the guy who
spat in the face of Jesus!

246
00:23:40,264 --> 00:23:42,596
So how does the story end?

247
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,826
lt ends with me in here,
before your very eyes, Doctor.

248
00:23:46,036 --> 00:23:48,402
Fatso was arrested
in under two months.

249
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:51,005
Doctor, ever seen a fat man
being beaten?

250
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:54,006
They even spill stuff they
weren't asked.

251
00:24:18,202 --> 00:24:21,069
A man was killed here.
Did you see anything?

252
00:24:21,271 --> 00:24:22,932
No.

253
00:24:27,678 --> 00:24:33,082
Jesus, Fatso, you turned
me in for Bristles' murder!

254
00:24:33,283 --> 00:24:36,275
You could have just squealed
about the robbery.

255
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:38,250
l fingered you for murder
because Bristles' brother...

256
00:24:38,455 --> 00:24:40,685
was going to kill me.

257
00:24:40,891 --> 00:24:43,985
We left his place together
for the jewelry store...

258
00:24:44,194 --> 00:24:48,358
then l came back alive,
and he got back dead.

259
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,767
l'm very upset.

260
00:24:53,804 --> 00:24:57,672
l could turn you in as
an accomplice...

261
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,901
but l won't.
l'll back your story up...

262
00:25:01,111 --> 00:25:05,480
l killed him and threw him
in the river all by myself.

263
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,483
Thanks, Ebony!

264
00:25:09,686 --> 00:25:12,780
l knew l could count on you.

265
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:17,188
l'll forgive you,
but you owe me one.

266
00:25:17,394 --> 00:25:19,328
And did Fatso ever pay his debt?

267
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,626
No way! Fatso died
trying to escape.

268
00:25:23,834 --> 00:25:26,268
They spent two years
digging a tunnel.

269
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:45,014
Let 's go, come on!

270
00:25:55,432 --> 00:26:00,631
Go on, Fatso.
Hurry up you big pile of shit!

271
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:04,632
Cadao! Give me a hand!
l'm stuck.

272
00:26:04,842 --> 00:26:08,403
Breathe in, man.
Suck yourself in.

273
00:26:08,612 --> 00:26:11,342
What do you mean?
l can't!

274
00:26:11,548 --> 00:26:13,243
Go back, then!

275
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,077
Go on!

276
00:26:16,353 --> 00:26:19,379
Gimme a break, Cadao.
Pull, go on, pull!

277
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,718
Shit, Fatso, l told you! Eating
everyone else's leftovers!

278
00:26:22,926 --> 00:26:25,121
Pull, go on!

279
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:28,389
-Please!
-Get him out the way!

280
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:32,758
Fatso's frustrated
brothers knifed him.

281
00:26:34,972 --> 00:26:37,065
Hell of a way to die,
eh Doctor?

282
00:26:37,274 --> 00:26:39,765
Right under the Virgin Mary, and
not even she could protect him.

283
00:26:41,378 --> 00:26:42,777
Too bad.

284
00:26:44,715 --> 00:26:46,546
What about this pain?

285
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:51,346
Your problem, Ebony, is stress--
what big shot executives get.

286
00:26:51,555 --> 00:26:54,490
Take one of these before bed.
They'll help you sleep.

287
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:56,989
lf you don't get better,
come back.

288
00:26:57,194 --> 00:27:00,129
God protect you, Doctor.

289
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:08,804
Doctor, come and see Chico's
balloon, quick!

290
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:20,244
lt 's the old man's obsession,
Doctor.

291
00:27:30,394 --> 00:27:32,328
Oh, too bad.

292
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:34,554
May l?

293
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:39,699
Hi, l'm Lady.
Lady Di.

294
00:27:39,903 --> 00:27:40,892
l've come to take the test.

295
00:27:41,104 --> 00:27:42,628
Please, take a seat.

296
00:27:53,283 --> 00:27:55,911
First l'd like to ask you
a few questions, Lady Di.

297
00:27:57,788 --> 00:28:00,951
l've seen this movie before,
Doctor.

298
00:28:01,158 --> 00:28:03,854
l've never needed
a blood transfusion...

299
00:28:04,061 --> 00:28:07,258
and l never pierce my veins.

300
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:11,659
The only drug l use is
a joint now and then...

301
00:28:11,868 --> 00:28:15,031
when l watch
TV or for a little romance.

302
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:18,940
And partners, how many?

303
00:28:19,543 --> 00:28:21,204
Oh, about 2,OOO.

304
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:37,652
May l?

305
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:44,366
Lady, the silicone you
used isn't meant for that.

306
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:47,234
As if l had the money for
something better, Doctor.

307
00:28:47,771 --> 00:28:49,238
Ever taken hormones?

308
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:52,272
No way!
Hormones are dreadful!

309
00:28:52,476 --> 00:28:54,444
You take them and
nothing happens.

310
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:57,808
And what our clients really like,
maybe you know, is to play the girl.

311
00:28:59,883 --> 00:29:00,907
Well, Lady...

312
00:29:01,118 --> 00:29:04,087
l think the time's come for you
to find out whether you're sick.

313
00:29:06,823 --> 00:29:09,291
l'll do it, Doctor.

314
00:29:09,926 --> 00:29:12,622
-Will it hurt?
-Not much.

315
00:29:43,427 --> 00:29:46,555
Get out of here.
Get out, man!

316
00:30:28,772 --> 00:30:30,296
Any room in there?

317
00:30:35,545 --> 00:30:37,604
Sure.

318
00:30:44,354 --> 00:30:46,288
Only it 'll cost you 2OO.

319
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:51,086
Pay for a bed?
l'm in jail, man!

320
00:30:52,062 --> 00:30:55,361
So you lived for free
on the outside, did you?

321
00:30:58,201 --> 00:31:01,295
lf you want to stay,
sleep on the floor.

322
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:07,208
Deusdete ain't sleeping
on no floor.

323
00:31:07,411 --> 00:31:10,710
He already has a place.

324
00:31:14,985 --> 00:31:17,249
Deusdete...

325
00:31:17,454 --> 00:31:19,684
just like l said,
right brother?

326
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:23,348
You ended up doing something
you shouldn't.

327
00:32:16,613 --> 00:32:18,103
And the rat?

328
00:32:18,315 --> 00:32:20,476
l smashed it against
the wall about ten times!

329
00:32:20,684 --> 00:32:23,175
Damn thing wouldn't let go!

330
00:32:26,156 --> 00:32:28,386
Sweet Mama, pray for me!

331
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:31,352
lt died?

332
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:32,719
Like hell it did!

333
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:37,229
So l grabbed it tight and stuck
my teeth into its brain.

334
00:32:37,434 --> 00:32:40,835
Then l just brushed my teeth,
and that was that.

335
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:42,998
Easy, man!

336
00:32:43,206 --> 00:32:45,538
You've been beaten with iron bars
and never made a sound.

337
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,884
Cut your finger, Highness?

338
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:05,061
Jesus, Lula, smoking crack?
You can't operate like that!

339
00:33:05,262 --> 00:33:08,857
Sorry, Doctor, only l operate
better when l smoke.

340
00:33:09,065 --> 00:33:11,192
What?! You can't keep
a steady hand on crack!

341
00:33:11,535 --> 00:33:13,332
Ah, that 's where
you're wrong, Doctor.

342
00:33:13,537 --> 00:33:16,233
l see the veins all
shining and fluorescent.

343
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:19,704
Looks like that casino
in Las Vegas!

344
00:33:20,577 --> 00:33:22,545
Take it easy, man!

345
00:33:22,746 --> 00:33:27,581
See, steady as a rock, and hardly
a millimeter between stitches.

346
00:33:27,784 --> 00:33:31,117
God protect you, Lula.
God bless you, God bless you all.

347
00:33:31,321 --> 00:33:34,813
That 's enough of God, Highness,
you're not kidding anyone!

348
00:33:35,025 --> 00:33:37,050
What, you married twice?

349
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,195
Well, Doctor, to me life's
a merry-go-round...

350
00:33:40,397 --> 00:33:42,695
and just the one horse
isn't enough.

351
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:48,132
That one there, that 's Dalva's,
my princess!

352
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:10,187
Honey, score a goal for me?
Please?

353
00:34:13,096 --> 00:34:15,656
Like it?
Yeah, l bet you do.

354
00:34:28,311 --> 00:34:30,779
Do you believe in love
at first sight?

355
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:33,541
What?!

356
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,617
Come with me. l'm going to ask
your parents for your hand.

357
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,220
Get out of here!
You don't even know me!

358
00:34:39,422 --> 00:34:42,687
-You're wrong!
-Wrong? You don't know me!

359
00:34:42,892 --> 00:34:46,988
Sure l do.
l know you just love spicy...

360
00:34:47,197 --> 00:34:49,290
-Sausage...
-Sausage!

361
00:34:49,499 --> 00:34:53,697
And l know you look gorgeous
in that pretty dress...

362
00:34:53,903 --> 00:34:56,269
And l know you deserve better
than that klutz over there.

363
00:34:56,473 --> 00:35:00,170
-My fiance!
-Fiance?!

364
00:35:00,377 --> 00:35:03,505
You're wasting your time.

365
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,783
Look what a great blend!

366
00:35:08,985 --> 00:35:12,011
We'll have one kid of each color.

367
00:35:14,491 --> 00:35:17,824
l'll be waiting in the car.

368
00:35:27,404 --> 00:35:30,202
Were you serious?

369
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:34,203
Never been more.

370
00:35:34,411 --> 00:35:37,312
What the hell's going on, Dalva?
What are you doing here?

371
00:35:41,117 --> 00:35:43,677
Go on, go away, will you?

372
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:45,878
What?! Honey, who is this?

373
00:35:46,189 --> 00:35:48,316
-l'm her husband.
-Husband?

374
00:35:48,525 --> 00:35:50,720
Sure. We're marrying.

375
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:53,987
Don't grab me like that!
Stop it!

376
00:35:54,197 --> 00:35:57,166
Get out of here, go on!

377
00:36:01,438 --> 00:36:03,133
See?

378
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:08,675
lf he were in love with you,
he wouldn't have run off!

379
00:36:12,982 --> 00:36:17,316
Jesus! Letting some
guy steal his girl!

380
00:36:20,256 --> 00:36:23,555
Tomorrow at eight,
get your family together...

381
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,957
and l'll ask for your hand.

382
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:32,059
l'd rather my daughter were dead
than marry a thieving nigger.

383
00:36:33,636 --> 00:36:35,866
You offend me, sir.
You've only just met me.

384
00:36:36,072 --> 00:36:39,564
l know enough to know you're
nothing but a lazy nigger!

385
00:36:39,776 --> 00:36:42,301
-Look here, sir, l came here...
-Forget it!

386
00:36:42,512 --> 00:36:45,037
You're too old to be
falling for some black man.

387
00:36:45,248 --> 00:36:47,876
Get down there!
Go on!

388
00:36:48,084 --> 00:36:49,073
Easy now!

389
00:36:49,285 --> 00:36:50,445
Down you go.

390
00:36:50,653 --> 00:36:53,747
Come on!

391
00:37:00,797 --> 00:37:02,992
<i>I marrIed her rIg</i>ht <i>there</i>.

392
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:08,136
<i>I took my Iove with me</i> ;<i>my bIack</i>
<i>fI</i>st <i>In hercotton</i>-<i>white hand</i>.

393
00:37:09,706 --> 00:37:12,573
Best thing that could have
happened to me, Doctor.

394
00:37:12,776 --> 00:37:14,573
Dalva gave me a family.

395
00:37:14,778 --> 00:37:15,767
So you stopped stealing.

396
00:37:15,979 --> 00:37:20,245
Of course not, Doctor! With her
by my side, l went up-market.

397
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,816
Took imported cars and
drove them to Paraguay.

398
00:37:23,019 --> 00:37:25,954
With cash in my pocket, l returned
to the peace of home life.

399
00:37:28,057 --> 00:37:29,046
Any kids?

400
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:32,524
Three with Dalva.
And one with Rosirene.

401
00:37:32,729 --> 00:37:36,825
You know how it is, the devil
only tempts those close to God.

402
00:37:37,033 --> 00:37:40,901
That ever happened to you?
Uncontrollable passion?

403
00:38:34,757 --> 00:38:38,090
What 's with the babe over there?

404
00:38:46,502 --> 00:38:50,632
What do you think?
She's over there.

405
00:38:55,478 --> 00:38:59,039
Don't you dance samba, miss?

406
00:39:01,584 --> 00:39:06,044
What am l, a monkey jumping
around for nothing?

407
00:39:09,492 --> 00:39:12,188
Looking for something
to jump to?

408
00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:16,765
Seems like you're the one wanting
to jump-- jump ship.

409
00:39:19,335 --> 00:39:21,667
Look, l'll take my wife home.

410
00:39:21,871 --> 00:39:24,032
Get your bikini, and
l'll come and fetch you.

411
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,505
We'll go and spend the
weekend at the beach.

412
00:39:27,944 --> 00:39:29,536
Does that sister know you
belong to me?

413
00:39:29,746 --> 00:39:31,441
Ease up, Dalva!
l was only going to the john!

414
00:39:31,648 --> 00:39:35,084
Like hell you were. And that,
why's that so hard then?

415
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:37,913
Doesn't look like it 's being
properly cared for.

416
00:39:40,623 --> 00:39:43,683
Watch your mouth,
you stinking black bitch!

417
00:39:43,893 --> 00:39:48,227
Get away from my man,
or you'll be sorry!

418
00:39:50,266 --> 00:39:54,362
Hey, handsome! So l guess
the beach is off, then?

419
00:40:01,077 --> 00:40:03,841
So what happened
to the black girl?

420
00:40:04,047 --> 00:40:06,880
Ah, now that 's where l had
to do a bit of juggling, Doctor.

421
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:10,610
From Monday to Thursday, Dalva.
And the rest, Rosirene.

422
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,584
l rented a little room for us
near the old bus station.

423
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,122
We had this great love affair
going, Doctor.

424
00:40:20,263 --> 00:40:22,094
Morning!

425
00:40:29,072 --> 00:40:30,869
Give me that!

426
00:40:31,074 --> 00:40:33,508
lt 's mine!

427
00:40:36,212 --> 00:40:39,807
Stop, you're messing me up!

428
00:40:51,394 --> 00:40:57,390
Don't let go of me, Highness.
Don't let go!

429
00:40:59,669 --> 00:41:02,570
Thanks, Powder, see you around!

430
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,380
You just can't quit this life,
can you?

431
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,150
l thought l told you
l'd take care of you.

432
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,590
l've always earned
my own money.

433
00:41:27,263 --> 00:41:29,026
And that guy you were with,
know who he is?

434
00:41:29,232 --> 00:41:33,225
What are you doing here?
l thought it was Snow White's day.

435
00:41:33,436 --> 00:41:36,701
Don't change the subject!
You know who he is?

436
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,066
Sure!
So what?

437
00:41:40,443 --> 00:41:44,937
So l told you-- do your
thing if you have to...

438
00:41:45,148 --> 00:41:48,675
but don't screw a friend of mine,
or l'll break your neck!

439
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:51,513
Powder's your friend?!

440
00:41:51,721 --> 00:41:56,158
Highness, you're a nobody.

441
00:41:56,359 --> 00:42:02,764
He said that when he leaves
his wife, we'll move to Miami.

442
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:07,458
-l'm off!
-Where to?

443
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,073
To Miami, honey!

444
00:42:14,277 --> 00:42:17,974
Well you're taking a souvenir
of mine with you!

445
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,522
That was rough, Doctor,
screwing a friend of mine...

446
00:42:29,725 --> 00:42:31,090
and the two of
them making plans!

447
00:42:31,294 --> 00:42:34,559
That night l went back to the
room and what do l see?

448
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,891
Jesus...

449
00:42:40,336 --> 00:42:43,203
get out of here!

450
00:42:43,406 --> 00:42:45,135
No way.

451
00:42:45,341 --> 00:42:48,367
Get out of here right now!

452
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:52,070
l won't go.

453
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:54,749
Get out, damn it!

454
00:42:54,951 --> 00:42:57,886
No way, l'm staying.

455
00:42:58,087 --> 00:43:01,784
Come on, Highness, bite me.

456
00:43:01,991 --> 00:43:05,620
Come on, bite me...

457
00:43:06,295 --> 00:43:09,458
bite me the way l like it.

458
00:43:11,534 --> 00:43:16,528
Bite, go on, bite!

459
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:25,744
Bite harder...

460
00:43:26,749 --> 00:43:28,979
harder!

461
00:43:53,676 --> 00:43:55,576
lt 's over!

462
00:43:59,115 --> 00:44:02,050
There, that 's so you learn
not to take what 's not yours!

463
00:44:02,185 --> 00:44:03,743
You arsonist bitch!

464
00:44:03,953 --> 00:44:05,420
Slut!

465
00:44:05,621 --> 00:44:09,284
Well, you might as well know that
this slut is expecting his child.

466
00:44:09,492 --> 00:44:11,983
No!

467
00:44:12,862 --> 00:44:19,028
Son of a bitch whore!
l'll kill you!

468
00:44:19,235 --> 00:44:22,136
You haven't heard
the last of this, Highness...

469
00:44:22,338 --> 00:44:24,363
you son of a bitch whore!

470
00:44:24,574 --> 00:44:27,839
Son of a bitch!

471
00:44:30,613 --> 00:44:32,444
Get your hands off my son!

472
00:44:32,648 --> 00:44:35,583
T<i>o kee</i>p D<i>aIva out of troubIe</i>,
<i>I took the bIame forthe fIre</i>.

473
00:44:36,953 --> 00:44:40,252
Only the law was already
on my back for other stuff...

474
00:44:40,456 --> 00:44:45,155
so l got 16 years for the fire,
reduced to 1O.

475
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:46,350
And was it worth it?

476
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:53,024
But Doctor, the black chick put
a spell on me. l'm outta here!

477
00:44:53,436 --> 00:44:58,339
T<i>herefore</i>,pe<i>rfectIy caImIy</i>,

00:45:29,105 --> 00:45:32,131
Letter from Franci?

487
00:45:38,014 --> 00:45:40,710
Your sister mention me at all?

488
00:45:41,117 --> 00:45:44,052
Course she does, right?

489
00:45:48,724 --> 00:45:52,421
Hey, Deusdete! What does
your sister say about me?

490
00:45:54,263 --> 00:45:56,993
She asks if you're okay.

491
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,293
That all?

492
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:04,564
What do you think? lf she knew
what you've been up to...

493
00:46:04,774 --> 00:46:07,140
she wouldn't even be asking that.

494
00:46:09,278 --> 00:46:12,076
l think she would...

495
00:46:12,281 --> 00:46:15,546
but you think you know better.

496
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:20,779
Wasn't it you used to say,
''lf you sell it, don't use it''?

497
00:46:23,192 --> 00:46:24,454
May l?

498
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,525
So what 's up?

499
00:46:27,897 --> 00:46:29,888
Come to settle your debt?

500
00:46:30,099 --> 00:46:34,058
Hey man, right now Ezequiel's
in a tight spot.

501
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:37,103
So he thinks to himself,
''Zico's a reasonable guy...

502
00:46:37,306 --> 00:46:40,537
He'll take the surfboard
as collateral for the debt.''

503
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:44,409
Then Ezequiel can have another
little rock of crack, right man?

504
00:46:45,815 --> 00:46:47,715
Wrong!

505
00:46:54,657 --> 00:46:57,592
Pay what you owe!

506
00:47:02,198 --> 00:47:04,758
Don't drink that, it 's blood!

507
00:47:07,303 --> 00:47:09,464
Shit!

508
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:11,506
l thought it was water.

509
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:15,905
Doctor, this guy was
sweating all night long.

510
00:47:16,112 --> 00:47:18,876
l've put him on antibiotics,
but if you ask me, it 's no use...

511
00:47:19,081 --> 00:47:21,811
it 's AlDS.

512
00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:26,611
Doctor! Doctor!

513
00:47:26,822 --> 00:47:29,552
Who took away his oxygen?

514
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,151
l don't want to die.

515
00:47:34,363 --> 00:47:38,390
Get me out of here, please!

516
00:47:39,402 --> 00:47:43,395
That 's hardly likely.
He's 213, rape.

517
00:47:44,206 --> 00:47:46,401
To us he's a patient.

518
00:47:46,609 --> 00:47:48,270
Doctor...

519
00:47:48,477 --> 00:47:50,502
Doctor...

520
00:47:50,713 --> 00:47:53,341
send me
to the yellow wing.

521
00:47:53,549 --> 00:47:57,781
l need to get somewhere safe.

522
00:47:57,987 --> 00:47:58,976
l don't want to die!

523
00:47:59,188 --> 00:48:03,022
l'm sorry, Doctor,
l'm against the death penalty...

524
00:48:03,225 --> 00:48:05,455
but not for rape.

525
00:48:05,661 --> 00:48:09,062
lf you ask me,
it 's just too bad.

526
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:17,700
So that 's it, Doctor.

527
00:48:55,644 --> 00:48:59,410
Come on, old man,
it 's past lock-down.

528
00:49:20,336 --> 00:49:22,861
Get a move on!

529
00:49:29,645 --> 00:49:32,910
What is it, what
are you looking at?

530
00:49:33,115 --> 00:49:36,983
You think your kids will jump
over the wall?

531
00:49:58,607 --> 00:50:02,134
You were asking for it this time,
weren't you, Chico?

532
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:10,173
See you in 3O days.

533
00:50:17,459 --> 00:50:23,193
Doctor, we're here to make
our relationship official.

534
00:50:23,399 --> 00:50:25,458
You understand,
Doctor...

535
00:50:25,668 --> 00:50:29,536
so we can be more open.
lt 's not the same with a rubber.

536
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:34,906
There's not much sense,
her taking the test and not you.

537
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:39,137
See? l told him, Doctor,
but he's scared.

538
00:50:39,348 --> 00:50:42,215
-Scared of what?
-Scared of injections.

539
00:50:42,418 --> 00:50:43,578
Too Bad?!

540
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:45,208
lt 's not that.

541
00:50:45,421 --> 00:50:47,651
So you're scared
of getting married!

542
00:50:47,856 --> 00:50:51,223
Doctor, you're needed, urgently!

543
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:54,054
Down you go, come on.

544
00:50:54,263 --> 00:50:57,460
lt 's all right now, Doctor.

545
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,426
l blacked out, Doctor.

546
00:51:01,637 --> 00:51:04,868
Giving us all a fright, Zico?

547
00:51:05,174 --> 00:51:08,507
lt 's just as well, Doctor.
Maybe he'll learn what drugs do.

548
00:51:08,711 --> 00:51:09,871
Tell him!

549
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,606
What 's there to tell?
Drugs kill.

550
00:51:13,816 --> 00:51:16,808
-And you, who are you?
-That 's Deusdete.

551
00:51:17,019 --> 00:51:20,648
We grew up together.

552
00:51:20,956 --> 00:51:24,653
You know, Doctor, one day
my mom didn't come home.

553
00:51:25,828 --> 00:51:31,198
l was left alone.
l waited and waited...

554
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:36,136
until he and his sister,
Franci, came...

555
00:51:36,338 --> 00:51:39,432
and took me to live with them.

556
00:51:48,384 --> 00:51:49,612
We grew up together.

557
00:52:17,479 --> 00:52:20,209
Come on, Zico!

558
00:52:34,596 --> 00:52:36,860
Wait, Zico!

559
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:11,766
Help! Help!

560
00:53:42,731 --> 00:53:45,529
lt was Zico saved me, Doctor.

561
00:53:45,734 --> 00:53:51,400
That 's right, Doctor, l've always
looked after him, from early on.

562
00:53:51,607 --> 00:53:55,134
Then you went the wrong way.

563
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,875
Doctor, what 's wrong with buying
some dope in Pernambuco...

564
00:54:02,017 --> 00:54:04,747
and selling it to folks
who like it?

565
00:54:04,953 --> 00:54:08,150
lt wasn't even that much!
Another two years, and l'm free.

566
00:54:08,357 --> 00:54:11,986
But l've never killed anyone.

567
00:54:12,194 --> 00:54:14,788
Unlike Deusdete, here.

568
00:54:14,997 --> 00:54:16,931
What was your crime?

569
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:20,192
Answer him, Deusdete!

570
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:28,735
To tell you the truth, Doctor,
he's not even a real criminal.

571
00:54:30,012 --> 00:54:32,947
So what are you in here for?

572
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:37,215
One night, l was at home...

573
00:54:38,187 --> 00:54:41,213
when my sister arrived,
acting strange.

574
00:54:41,423 --> 00:54:46,918
What 's wrong, Franci?
What happened?

575
00:54:47,129 --> 00:54:48,790
Franci!

576
00:54:55,237 --> 00:54:58,297
Franci, what happened?

577
00:54:59,174 --> 00:55:01,734
Open up, come on!

578
00:55:01,944 --> 00:55:04,344
What happened?

579
00:55:10,786 --> 00:55:13,346
What happened, Franci?

580
00:55:16,258 --> 00:55:19,159
Tell me!

581
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:22,421
What happened?

582
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:26,626
Tell me!

583
00:55:26,835 --> 00:55:29,770
There were two of them.

584
00:55:30,939 --> 00:55:33,840
They grabbed me...

585
00:55:34,643 --> 00:55:37,441
lifted my skirt...

586
00:55:39,448 --> 00:55:43,680
one said he wanted to suck me.
l told him to go suck his mother!

587
00:55:43,886 --> 00:55:46,047
-What did they do to you?
-They beat me.

588
00:55:46,255 --> 00:55:49,053
What else, huh?

589
00:55:49,258 --> 00:55:50,316
What else?!

590
00:55:50,525 --> 00:55:53,426
-That 's all, Deusdete.
-Who was it?

591
00:55:53,629 --> 00:55:55,062
l just ran off!

592
00:56:05,207 --> 00:56:07,402
Hey, Zico!

593
00:56:09,845 --> 00:56:13,872
Deusdete! What are you
doing here, man?

594
00:56:14,082 --> 00:56:16,710
l need to talk.

595
00:56:16,919 --> 00:56:19,479
Excuse us.

596
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,591
ls Mother all right?

597
00:56:33,802 --> 00:56:38,000
lt 's not her. Some guys
messed with Franci.

598
00:56:49,685 --> 00:56:51,983
What did they do to her?

599
00:56:52,187 --> 00:56:55,156
Nothing much, she says. But l
reported it to the cops, anyway.

600
00:56:56,058 --> 00:56:59,755
The cops?! You think
the cops'll do anything?!

601
00:56:59,962 --> 00:57:04,092
The problem is, the guys found
out, and now they're after me.

602
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:08,766
Leave it to me.
l'll sort them out.

603
00:57:08,971 --> 00:57:15,069
No, Zico. Not your way.
l don't want that.

604
00:57:17,112 --> 00:57:20,707
l just want a gun,
to defend myself.

605
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:32,920
Take your pick.

606
00:57:46,008 --> 00:57:49,944
Even with a gun, Doctor, l never
thought anything would happen.

607
00:57:51,346 --> 00:57:52,938
But...

608
00:57:53,148 --> 00:57:54,172
it was my destiny.

609
00:57:54,383 --> 00:57:56,817
And theirs,
when they found me.

610
00:58:05,761 --> 00:58:09,527
So! Where's the stool pigeon
off to tonight, then?

611
00:58:09,731 --> 00:58:11,722
l'm not looking for a fight.
Let me go home!

612
00:58:11,933 --> 00:58:16,393
Sure thing, but first we're
going to caress you...

613
00:58:16,605 --> 00:58:19,574
just like we did
your little sister.

614
00:59:57,339 --> 00:59:59,364
Hey, man!

615
01:00:32,707 --> 01:00:34,800
Give me a Coke.

616
01:00:40,182 --> 01:00:43,982
You know how old l'll be
when l get out of here, Doctor?

617
01:00:45,854 --> 01:00:48,186
Forty-eight!

618
01:00:49,457 --> 01:00:51,425
There!

619
01:00:56,831 --> 01:00:58,594
One...

620
01:00:59,301 --> 01:01:01,166
two...

621
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:04,100
three...

622
01:01:04,472 --> 01:01:06,497
four...

623
01:01:06,942 --> 01:01:08,807
five...

624
01:01:09,144 --> 01:01:10,736
six...

625
01:01:11,646 --> 01:01:13,614
seven...

626
01:01:16,184 --> 01:01:18,277
eight!

627
01:01:24,759 --> 01:01:27,956
Found it!

628
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:43,435
So it 's Visitors Day, is it?

629
01:01:43,645 --> 01:01:46,045
lf you like, you can go now.

630
01:01:56,691 --> 01:01:59,125
Ebony...

631
01:01:59,894 --> 01:02:03,694
l've got a problem.
l need to talk.

632
01:02:03,898 --> 01:02:06,025
This problem got a name?

633
01:02:06,234 --> 01:02:07,565
Ezequiel.

634
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:10,431
He still owes me, and now he's
even trying to get more on account.

635
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:15,899
He comes to my cell, raises his
voice, what 's he playing at?!

636
01:02:16,111 --> 01:02:18,636
-And you?
-Me?

637
01:02:18,847 --> 01:02:22,305
lf l don't get paid,
l can't pay Highness.

638
01:02:22,517 --> 01:02:25,350
l want your permission
to kill the bastard.

639
01:02:25,553 --> 01:02:28,522
This goes on much longer, l'll
start losing respect around here.

640
01:02:28,723 --> 01:02:30,486
Cool it!

641
01:02:31,893 --> 01:02:35,920
l'll tell Ezequiel to get
the money from his family.

642
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:39,794
lf he doesn't pay,
you can go ahead.

643
01:02:50,478 --> 01:02:52,810
This man has already lost a lung...

644
01:02:53,014 --> 01:02:54,675
and the other's in pretty
bad shape.

645
01:02:54,883 --> 01:02:57,681
Take the medicine, man, go on.

646
01:02:58,853 --> 01:03:00,946
See, Doctor?
He won't take it.

647
01:03:01,156 --> 01:03:06,219
What are you, a kid? You won't
get better if you don't take it.

648
01:03:07,262 --> 01:03:09,389
Come on, that 's right.

649
01:03:09,597 --> 01:03:12,430
Come on.

650
01:03:18,473 --> 01:03:20,270
That 's it.

651
01:03:22,143 --> 01:03:23,633
Right.

652
01:03:23,845 --> 01:03:24,834
Good.

653
01:03:25,046 --> 01:03:27,014
And on the outside?
What did he do?

654
01:03:27,649 --> 01:03:29,981
We used to rob armored trucks.

655
01:03:30,185 --> 01:03:34,519
Just the two of us, we planned
everything, remember?

656
01:03:34,723 --> 01:03:37,624
Doctor, we'd spend six months
just gathering information.

657
01:03:37,826 --> 01:03:39,885
We'd even make friends
with the guards' families.

658
01:03:40,095 --> 01:03:42,154
And that paid off?

659
01:03:42,364 --> 01:03:43,854
Sure, plenty.

660
01:03:44,065 --> 01:03:46,192
Although we'd
only use half the money.

661
01:03:46,401 --> 01:03:51,338
The rest we'd put aside
for a rainy day...

662
01:03:51,539 --> 01:03:52,767
or to bribe the cops.

663
01:04:06,588 --> 01:04:08,783
lt 's coming.

664
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:15,621
Right, get over there!

665
01:04:37,485 --> 01:04:38,474
Come on!

666
01:04:38,686 --> 01:04:40,153
Stop!

667
01:04:42,957 --> 01:04:45,926
Come on! You going to sit there
on top of other people's money?!

668
01:04:46,127 --> 01:04:48,652
lf you don't come out, it 'll be
too bad for your widows.

669
01:04:48,863 --> 01:04:50,990
Open that door,
for Christ 's sake!

670
01:04:53,134 --> 01:04:54,692
Come on, get out!

671
01:04:54,903 --> 01:04:56,962
So we paid off the others...

672
01:04:57,172 --> 01:04:59,970
and each went his own way,
back to the family.

673
01:05:02,777 --> 01:05:06,611
So anyway, Antonio,
what 's on your mind?

674
01:05:08,483 --> 01:05:10,542
Miro...

675
01:05:11,386 --> 01:05:14,355
your wife's cheating on you.

676
01:05:14,823 --> 01:05:17,485
With a cop.

677
01:05:19,694 --> 01:05:20,683
Says who?

678
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,863
Says no one.
l saw her.

679
01:05:23,064 --> 01:05:27,057
They were making out
in a squad car.

680
01:05:27,435 --> 01:05:30,461
Near the old bakery.

681
01:05:39,347 --> 01:05:41,076
Dina doesn't buy bread there.

682
01:05:41,282 --> 01:05:44,513
Miro, l saw her. And it
wasn't bread she was after.

683
01:05:52,827 --> 01:05:54,385
Celia...

684
01:05:55,597 --> 01:05:59,055
is Antonio Carlos gay?

685
01:05:59,467 --> 01:06:02,163
What a question, Dina!

686
01:06:04,038 --> 01:06:05,062
l'm sorry, but he made
up this story...

687
01:06:05,273 --> 01:06:08,174
and told Miro l've been
going out with a cop.

688
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:12,976
Like hell l made it up.
l saw you crawling all over him.

689
01:06:13,181 --> 01:06:15,115
You nibbled his ear, damn it!

690
01:06:15,316 --> 01:06:18,717
Then it 's me he's really after,
honey.

691
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:21,388
You forgot the best part:

692
01:06:21,589 --> 01:06:25,116
how you asked me to run away
with you and dump Miro...

693
01:06:25,326 --> 01:06:28,921
and that l turned you down
because l love my husband...

694
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:31,928
and your wife's my friend!

695
01:06:32,133 --> 01:06:34,658
Liar! Evil slut!

696
01:06:43,478 --> 01:06:48,575
Miro, you don't believe
that bitch, do you?

697
01:06:49,484 --> 01:06:54,820
Man, how many jobs have
we pulled off together?

698
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:57,383
And our agreement!

699
01:06:57,592 --> 01:07:01,119
Celia, see if you can't keep
your man around the house.

700
01:07:01,329 --> 01:07:03,422
l don't want him pestering
me in the street anymore.

701
01:07:07,702 --> 01:07:09,670
Miro!

702
01:07:13,308 --> 01:07:14,297
Miro...

703
01:07:14,509 --> 01:07:18,070
Bastard! You dirty bastard!
You've never fooled me...

704
01:07:18,279 --> 01:07:21,442
l always knew you
had a crush on her.

705
01:07:21,649 --> 01:07:24,049
Can't even respect your best
friend's wife, you dog!

706
01:07:24,252 --> 01:07:27,119
-Calm down.
-Dog!

707
01:07:30,925 --> 01:07:33,723
Miro, l'm telling
you the truth!

708
01:07:42,236 --> 01:07:45,933
l lost my friend and partner.
The first robbery without him...

709
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:48,267
there were so many cops, Doctor,
it looked more like...

710
01:07:48,476 --> 01:07:51,274
-a military parade.
-What about him?

711
01:07:51,479 --> 01:07:54,107
l only found out when
he arrived here.

712
01:07:54,315 --> 01:07:58,251
l thought l'd gone to hell,
Doctor, but him?

713
01:07:58,853 --> 01:08:01,981
Come here, come on.

714
01:08:05,693 --> 01:08:07,991
Come here.

715
01:08:20,041 --> 01:08:24,774
Miro, don't you think
it 's time you quit?

716
01:08:27,048 --> 01:08:32,145
Take what you've got and start
a decent life someplace else?

717
01:08:32,353 --> 01:08:36,255
Give the kid a better chance.

718
01:09:02,784 --> 01:09:05,685
Stop!
Police!

719
01:09:06,154 --> 01:09:08,884
Party's over, Miro!

720
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:12,787
l'll cut you in. lt 's cheaper
for me to cut you guys in...

721
01:09:12,994 --> 01:09:15,485
than give it to a lawyer.

722
01:09:15,697 --> 01:09:19,326
You don't get it. We're taking
the lot. Everything.

723
01:09:19,534 --> 01:09:22,662
Hand it over, the dough,
come on, quick!

724
01:09:34,482 --> 01:09:39,317
Too bad, a smart guy like you
trusting his own wife.

725
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,047
Some guys are born
to be cheated on.

726
01:09:58,372 --> 01:10:01,569
Are you all right?

727
01:10:21,963 --> 01:10:24,193
Doctor...

728
01:10:25,366 --> 01:10:31,601
do small kids remember
everything we do?

729
01:10:33,508 --> 01:10:36,773
No, not a thing.

730
01:10:38,746 --> 01:10:40,577
Doctor...

731
01:10:40,782 --> 01:10:43,774
let him go.

732
01:11:11,946 --> 01:11:17,350
And with you now,
our untamed diva of dance...

733
01:11:17,552 --> 01:11:20,680
the woman who lives in all
thieves' hearts...

734
01:11:20,888 --> 01:11:24,016
here at the Detention Center...

735
01:11:24,225 --> 01:11:30,892
the one and only
Rita Cadillac!

736
01:12:23,885 --> 01:12:25,853
Hello!

737
01:12:26,053 --> 01:12:32,720
l know you all fool around
a lot, right?

738
01:12:35,429 --> 01:12:38,694
But do you take care
of yourselves?

739
01:12:39,834 --> 01:12:44,771
Our friend the doctor
came here today...

740
01:12:44,972 --> 01:12:47,566
and he's taught me enough
to teach you, too, right?

741
01:12:47,975 --> 01:12:49,909
That 's right!

742
01:12:50,111 --> 01:12:54,104
Okay, so some of you are
careful, and others forget...

743
01:12:54,315 --> 01:12:58,411
so l'm going to teach you
what to do.
