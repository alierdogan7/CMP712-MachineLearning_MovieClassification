01:18:11,057 --> 01:18:12,536

722
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:47,048
SING:
You mustn't smoke
while you're hurt.

723
01:18:48,497 --> 01:18:49,930
Let me handle this.

724
01:19:04,097 --> 01:19:05,496
This makes no sense.

725
01:19:16,657 --> 01:19:20,570
Who knew the Beast
could clear the chi flow

726
01:19:20,737 --> 01:19:23,205
and thus unleash
the boy's true potential?

727
01:19:23,377 --> 01:19:26,175
We should've guessed.

728
01:19:27,377 --> 01:19:30,608
He is the one!

730
01:19:40,657 --> 01:19:42,488
Is this for real?

731
01:19:42,657 --> 01:19:45,125
You're still alive,
you turncoat?

732
01:19:45,297 --> 01:19:47,572
Kill him, men!

733
01:20:40,177 --> 01:20:41,610
What kind of move is that?

734
01:20:41,937 --> 01:20:44,326

736
01:21:11,057 --> 01:21:14,527
If our son were alive,
he'd be his age now.

737
01:21:14,697 --> 01:21:19,817
If he studies hard,
he could grow up to be
a doctor or lawyer.

738
01:21:19,977 --> 01:21:22,696
A stuntman, more likely!

01:24:15,537 --> 01:24:18,688
What? The Toad Style
of the Kwan Lun School?

748
01:24:18,857 --> 01:24:20,085
Oh, no!

[BIRD SCREECHES]

751
01:26:10,937 --> 01:26:14,725
Remember the Palm move
that falls from heaven?

752
01:26:14,897 --> 01:26:17,934
That's the long lost
Buddhist Palm.

I surrender!

756
01:28:00,577 --> 01:28:01,930
What kind of move was that?

757
01:28:03,697 --> 01:28:05,767
If you want to learn,
I'll teach you.

Hey! Tell him not
to put snot on the glass.

Kid, you have the bone
structure of a kung-fu genius.

766
01:30:46,537 --> 01:30:50,166
World peace is in your
hands. Here's the scroll
of the Buddhist Palm.

767
01:30:50,337 --> 01:30:52,612
Because it's fate,
I'll let you have it for $10.

Wait!

769
