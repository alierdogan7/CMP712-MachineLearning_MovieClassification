3
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,099
...qui te custodiat
ab hoste maligno,

4
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:18,169
et perducat in vitam aeternam.

5
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:19,837
Amen.

6
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,578
Asperges me, Domine, hyssopo,
et mundabor: lavabis me,

7
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:29,480
et super nivem dealbabor.

8
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:33,751
[Pope]: You are afraid
to enter, but you must.

9
00:02:33,785 --> 00:02:38,489
- ...secundum multitudinem...
- [Pope]: I am about to meet my maker.

10
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:43,894
I have confessed.
And I...

11
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:49,400
confess...
I am very afraid.

12
00:02:49,434 --> 00:02:51,135
Colonna.

13
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:55,406
Sforza. Orsini.

14
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,441
Borgia.

15
00:02:57,476 --> 00:03:01,178
- Your Holiness.
- Della Rovere.

16
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:03,180
...Gloria Patri...

17
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:12,022
You will fight like dogs
over this corpse I leave

18
00:03:12,057 --> 00:03:15,826
for this throne
of St. Peter's.

19
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:20,965
But it was pure once.

20
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:28,639
We have all sullied it
with our greed

21
00:03:28,673 --> 00:03:31,709
and lechery.

22
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:39,517
Which of you...
will wash it clean?

23
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:45,356
It shall be cleansed,
Your Holiness,

24
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,359
with the tears we shed for you.

25
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:50,828
I swear before the Living God.

26
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:54,398
You swear thus?
A Spanish murrano? A white moor?

27
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:56,634
- As Vice-Chancellor,

28
00:03:56,668 --> 00:04:01,372
I swear before the Living d.

29
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:05,809
- And so do I, Your Holiness.
- And I, Your Holiness. - And I.

30
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:08,179
Rest assured, Your Holiness.

31
00:04:08,213 --> 00:04:14,385
The glory of our Holy Mother
Church will be restored in my lifetime.

32
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:20,824
[Pope]: Please...

33
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:22,593
...God.

34
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:32,970
[Man and woman panting
and gasping]

35
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,774
There's a door behind...
leads to the street.

36
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:12,743
The back passage?

37
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:17,881
- You're a cleric?
- Didn't you notice?

38
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,883
There was nothing
ecclesiastical about you

39
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,620
- last night.
- By night...

40
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:25,055
By night I am who I want to be.

41
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,725
By day, I am thus.

42
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,261
[Knocking]

43
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:32,129
Lucrezia!

44
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:38,569
- Sister!
- I spied a lady... another one!

45
00:05:38,603 --> 00:05:40,571
There's a punishment for spying.

46
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:42,539
- What's that?
- Oh, I think you know!

47
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:45,242
No!
[Squealing and laughing]

48
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:48,279
[Laughing]

49
00:05:49,948 --> 00:05:53,317
Can I come to your wedding?

50
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:55,619
I'll never have a wedding,
you know that.

51
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:58,756
No. You are betrothed to God.

52
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,360
Don't you love God, Cesare?

53
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:06,597
More than I love you?

54
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:08,399
Don't be sad, brother.

55
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:12,169
Maybe Papa will become pope,

56
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:14,505
and you can be
who you want to be.

57
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:17,808
If he does become pope,
I'll be what he wants me to be.

58
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:20,344
Can a pope have children, Cesare?

59
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:24,682
I've heard it rumoured
that Pope Innocent has 12.

60
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:28,085
But I have also heard
it rumoured that he is dying.

61
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:30,387
No news in that.
He's been dying for weeks now.

62
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:33,590
If he does die,
will our father wear his crown?

63
00:06:35,593 --> 00:06:39,029
The new pope will be elected
by the College of Cardinals, my love.

64
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:43,400
And only God can
predict the outcome.

65
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:46,270
Well, since
you will have no wedding,

66
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:48,872
I will pray for God
to choose Papa.

67
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:53,644
I want to wear a beautiful white veil
crowned with pearls for his coronation.

68
00:06:53,678 --> 00:06:56,080
God may need some help, then.

69
00:06:56,114 --> 00:07:00,551
[Bell tolling]
[Crowd speaking animatedly]

70
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:03,487
- What have they heard?
- The pope breathes his last.

71
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:05,522
God rest his soul...

72
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:12,296
[Bell tolling quietly]

73
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,331
[Muted speaking]

74
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,278
We must get you out of here
before they lock the doors.

75
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:31,348
- And so it begins.
- You know what to do?

76
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:34,184
- Yes, Father.
- Keep our family safe.

77
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:37,788
Until the new pope is elected,
it will be anarchy in Rome...

78
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:40,524
every faction fighting
for its own candidate.

79
00:07:40,558 --> 00:07:43,527
And if... after the first vote...
if the smoke is black...

80
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:47,865
As you said, Father,
I know what to do.

81
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:54,138
[Whispering]: I have waited
a lifetime for this moment.

82
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:56,673
We will go over it again.

83
00:07:56,708 --> 00:08:00,878
If we fail at the first vote,
I will send word...

84
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:02,179
On the wings of a dove...

85
00:08:02,213 --> 00:08:05,816
...names of those cardinals
who need persuading.

86
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,786
With properties, benefices,
and, if need be, gold.

87
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,021
They call it simony, Father.

88
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:13,190
God will forgive us, my son.

89
00:08:13,224 --> 00:08:16,026
But I will not forgive failure...

90
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,363
...from you
or your brother.

91
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:20,998
Am I understood?

92
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:25,102
We will not fail you, Father.

93
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,339
Mm.

94
00:08:32,877 --> 00:08:34,378
Go now.

95
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:41,718
Back to Spain, Borgia!
You've had your day in Rome.

96
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:44,822
- You can't wring any more favours
from a dead pope. - I was born here,

97
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:46,824
- as far as I'm aware.
- If a pig is born

98
00:08:46,858 --> 00:08:52,262
in a stable, does that make him a horse?
[Crowd laughing appreciatively]

99
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:54,498
[Man chuckling] Tsk, tsk, tsk!

100
00:08:54,532 --> 00:08:56,667
Rome is for Romans now.

101
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:59,470
The new pope will see to that.

102
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:01,438
And if the new pope is Spanish?

103
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:03,807
And if my mother's
the Virgin Mary?

104
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:06,643
Was the Virgin a Roman whore?
That's news to me.

105
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:09,179
[Man grunting angrily]

106
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:12,516
[Grunting with effort]
[Crowd jeering]

107
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:16,753
[Grunting]

108
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,535
Excuse me.

109
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:34,571
- Ah!
- Ah...

110
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:37,441
My brother speaks
before he thinks.

111
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:41,078
[Man panting]
He begs your pardon.

112
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:50,954
- I should have let them do it.
- Kill me? Your younger brother?

113
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:53,790
Our father would
never have forgiven you.

114
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:10,374
Have you heard?

115
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:12,976
[Woman]: Even Gioffre has
heard. Have you not?

116
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:15,846
- [Boy]: The pope has died.
- You know what that means?

117
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,915
I know there will be an election.

118
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:20,517
And the city will be bedlam
until it's over.

119
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:23,353
[Lucrezia]: Do you think
our father can win, Juan?

120
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:25,522
[Juan]: Are we allowed
to dream, Mother?

121
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:29,860
Your father found ways to love and care
for us in this house, but I'm not sure

122
00:10:29,894 --> 00:10:33,163
- as pope he can do the same.
- As pope, he can do what he wants.

123
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:34,665
Are you sure?

124
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:37,401
Kings and popes and emperors
belong to their peoples,

125
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:39,469
not to their families.

126
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:41,972
So, we allow the election
to run its course,

127
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:44,708
- and he won't be pope.
- What other course is there?

128
00:10:44,742 --> 00:10:47,444
- It's in the hands of God.
- It's in the hands

129
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:52,316
of the College of Cardinals, Mother.
It's not quite the same thing.

130
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,151
This one.

131
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:03,660
- Cardinal Borgia.
- My Lord Cardinal.

132
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:08,198
- Whoever wins this contest...
- Election.

133
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:12,869
If you were a different man...

134
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:15,405
...I might vote
for you.

135
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,243
You've performed your duties
as Vice-Chancellor admirably.

136
00:11:20,278 --> 00:11:22,980
The Church has need of your...

137
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:27,184
...organizational
genius.

138
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:29,152
But...

139
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:31,622
She has other needs as well.

140
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:33,290
And they would be?

141
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:36,393
Honesty.

142
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:38,695
Probity.

143
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,998
Goodness.

144
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:44,267
You find me lacking
in those qualities?

145
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:46,236
Yes.

146
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,805
And so I shall fight you.

147
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,243
To the end, and beyond that, if need
be, with any means at my disposal.

148
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:58,348
I do tend to win
whatever battles I fight.

149
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:04,121
But what talk we of fighting?

150
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:06,490
It is all in God's hands.

151
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:11,028
Good night, My Lord.

152
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:20,504
To Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia,

153
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:23,006
four votes.
[Cardinals murmuring]

154
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,842
To Cardinal Ascanio Sforza,

155
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:28,245
six votes.
[Cardinals murmuring]

156
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,515
To Cardinal Guilliano
Della Rovere,

157
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:34,418
seven votes.
[Cardinals murmuring]

158
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:37,821
To Cardinal Orsino Orsini,

159
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:39,890
six votes.

160
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:45,295
None has the require majority...

161
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:47,831
[Crowd murmuring]

162
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:54,104
Dominus Deum...

163
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:57,107
After the death of Pope Sixtus,

164
00:12:57,141 --> 00:13:01,411
- they holed us up here for a month...
- Appalling.

165
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:07,451
The company was tolerable,
but as for the food...

166
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:09,720
I had to lead the revolt...

167
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:13,790
insist our dishes could be
brought in from outside.

168
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:15,525
How wise.

169
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,362
And now there's crystal
in my soup.

170
00:13:19,397 --> 00:13:21,164
Please,

171
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:23,500
have mine, Your Grace.

172
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:26,203
Oh.

173
00:13:26,237 --> 00:13:28,839
Don't drink this.
It's vinegar; I've tasted it.

174
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:30,774
[Wine spilt onto the ground]

175
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:36,646
[Whispering]: From my vineyards
in Valencia.

176
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:45,255
How can I thank you?

177
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:47,324
Hmm...
I wonder...

178
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:50,293
Mmm!

179
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:52,195
...est a me...

180
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,965
The rules are clear.
No outside contact is

181
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,967
permitted under any circumstance.

182
00:13:57,001 --> 00:14:00,470
But you must know that
Cardinal Versucci's digestion is

183
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:04,007
- very delicate.
- Which is why he has rabbit baked in milk.

184
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,343
Ah.

185
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:08,879
Good.
And...

186
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:11,281
Cardinal Piccolomini...

187
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:13,350
Uh...

188
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:16,186
Suckling pig with rosemary.

189
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,856
- Indeed. The well-being
of the curia...

190
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:23,059
...is of the greatest
importance. As Vice-Chancellor,

191
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:26,062
their health is my concern.
Mens sana in corpore sano.

192
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:28,999
I think St. Augustine might
disagree with you. He extolled

193
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:32,769
- the virtues of fasting.
- St. Augustine...

194
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:35,372
...never had to vote
in conclave.

195
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,181
My dear sons,

196
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:47,717
the Cardinals Versucci,
Piccolomini, and Sanso,

197
00:14:47,752 --> 00:14:49,753
grant some titles

198
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:52,589
and benefices
from the Borgia abbeys,

199
00:14:52,623 --> 00:14:54,357
monasteries, and bishoprics.

200
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:57,394
[Cesare's voice]: ...Versucci,
Piccolomini, and Sanso,

201
00:14:57,428 --> 00:15:01,164
grant some titles and benefices
from the Borgia abbeys,

202
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,533
monasteries, and bishoprics.

203
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:07,938
Julius... Versucci...

204
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:11,508
All rights to the Abbey of...

205
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,277
...St. Catherine
of Siena.

206
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:16,780
Cardinal Allesandro Piccolomini.

207
00:15:16,814 --> 00:15:19,149
Suckling pig

208
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:21,218
for the cardinal, roasted.

209
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:23,820
Roasted and...

210
00:15:23,855 --> 00:15:25,655
...stuffed.

211
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,059
- Cardinal Julius Versucci.
- Uh, rabbit.

212
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:31,494
Rabbit...

213
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:33,897
...baked in milk.

214
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:09,132
Tasty.

215
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:14,237
Cardinal Giuliano Della Rovere...

216
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:17,307
...has garnered ten votes.
[Cardinals murmuring]

217
00:16:17,341 --> 00:16:21,444
Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, five.

218
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:26,049
Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia has
garnered eight votes.

219
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,552
But none has the required
majority.

220
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:31,588
[Cardinals murmuring]

221
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:36,393
[Doves cooing]
[Borgia]: My dear son,

222
00:16:36,427 --> 00:16:39,095
we are in sight of our goal,

223
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,798
but now you must redouble
our efforts.

224
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:44,334
Send your brother
round the Borgia churches

225
00:16:44,368 --> 00:16:48,471
to empty them of gold, ornaments,
and precious stone.

226
00:16:48,506 --> 00:16:50,941
I have emptied the churches
of the Romagna.

227
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:53,443
I have stripped altars bare.

228
00:16:53,477 --> 00:16:55,779
They were rotten
with gold ornament.

229
00:16:55,813 --> 00:16:57,747
Yes, you are
a true reformer, brother.

230
00:16:57,782 --> 00:17:00,784
These cardinals know no vows
of poverty.

231
00:17:04,388 --> 00:17:07,057
[Lucrezia]: Why the dove,
Cesare?

232
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,695
It has a dual purpose, my love.

233
00:17:11,729 --> 00:17:14,064
Like many things in life,

234
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:17,600
it serves as both a symbol
and a messenger.

235
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:22,105
- A symbol of what?
- Of the uncorrupted soul.

236
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:24,941
And a messenger of what?

237
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:27,210
Of corruption.

238
00:17:27,244 --> 00:17:31,081
You mean to say it bears news
of how many votes

239
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:34,017
we must buy
in the Papal election.

240
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:36,086
You are criminally
well informed, sis.

241
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,989
But I trust your soul is still
of the purest white.

242
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:42,292
How many votes
must we buy him, Cesare?

243
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:44,294
You know too much already,
don't you?

244
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:47,364
You're wrong.
I know too little...

245
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:50,500
[Cesare's voice]: Dear Father,
nine mules laden down

246
00:17:50,534 --> 00:17:53,236
with gold and treasure are being
distributed

247
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,505
to the palaces
of the following cardinals:

248
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:58,641
Cardinal Giuliano Della Rovere
has garnered...

249
00:17:58,676 --> 00:18:01,411
...Cardinal Ascana Sforza has
garnered four...

250
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:05,682
...Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia has
garnered ten votes.

251
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:08,151
None has the required majority.

252
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:18,028
Of course, Cardinal Sforza,
the entire conclave knows

253
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:20,530
that I cannot be both
Vice-Chancellor

254
00:18:20,564 --> 00:18:22,532
and pope of Rome.

255
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:25,668
- Than you can no longer be
a Vice-Chancellor.

256
00:18:25,703 --> 00:18:27,604
You mean...

257
00:18:27,638 --> 00:18:30,473
...I may yet be
pope of Rome?

258
00:18:30,508 --> 00:18:34,978
- If you can find
a suitable Vice-Chancellor.

259
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:39,049
And how would you describe
the qualities necessary

260
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,585
for a suitable Vice-Chancellor,
Cardinal Sforza?

261
00:18:44,588 --> 00:18:46,823
- Discretion.
- Mm-hmm.

262
00:18:46,857 --> 00:18:49,225
Loyalty.

263
00:18:51,228 --> 00:18:53,730
And a certain kind of wisdom.

264
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:58,101
Can you be more specific?

265
00:19:00,104 --> 00:19:02,305
I would say
the one who would be suitable

266
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:08,111
as Vice-Chancellor would be wise to support
the Vice-Chancellor who would be pope.

267
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:11,714
Hmm.

268
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:17,854
And I would say...

269
00:19:17,888 --> 00:19:20,056
...we have an understanding.

270
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:27,163
Cardinal Giuliano Della Rovere
has garnered seven votes.

271
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:32,769
Cardinal Alberto Colonna, two.

272
00:19:32,803 --> 00:19:36,039
Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia...

273
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:38,341
...fourteen.
[Excited murmuring]

274
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:42,745
Cardinal Borgia has
the required majority.

275
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,883
Correction:
Cardinal Borgia has bought

276
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:49,385
the required majority.

277
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,822
What is your implication?

278
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:55,792
His implication is that
the throne of St. Peter's is

279
00:19:55,826 --> 00:19:57,794
- for sale.
- And has been bought

280
00:19:57,828 --> 00:20:00,463
by a Spaniard
up to his elbows in simony.

281
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:02,799
I see.

282
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,301
You would prefer it had been
bought by an Italian?

283
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:09,839
By someone remotely worthy
of the papacy at least...

284
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:13,610
Then my first act
as pope will be to institute

285
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:15,945
an inquiry
into the elective process.

286
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,915
My second, of course...

287
00:20:18,949 --> 00:20:23,386
...will be to appoint
a Vice-Chancellor...

288
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,657
the greatest office,
with the greatest income,

289
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:29,392
in my gift.

290
00:20:29,426 --> 00:20:33,229
Now, there are
two obvious choices:

291
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:35,865
Cardinals Della Rovere
and Orsini.

292
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,636
But the pope could
not possibly appoint one

293
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,906
who questioned his right
to be pope.

294
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,908
That was not my intention.

295
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:48,278
[Chuckling]
Nor was it mine.

296
00:20:48,312 --> 00:20:51,414
I see.

297
00:20:51,448 --> 00:20:56,152
And the Spanish race is closest
to your bosom.

298
00:21:02,993 --> 00:21:07,063
- Can we proceed, then?
- To conclude:

299
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:09,966
Cardinal Borgia has the required
majority.

300
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,139
An examination, testes
et pendentes, is required.

301
00:21:16,173 --> 00:21:20,510
And Cardinal Borgia is happy
to comply.

302
00:21:32,122 --> 00:21:35,558
Can there be any doubt
that the good cardinal is male?

303
00:21:35,593 --> 00:21:37,560
Not if we count his children.

304
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:40,563
Let him without children cast
the first stone.

305
00:21:40,598 --> 00:21:42,398
I have heard rumours...

306
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:45,435
- ...of a rhinoceros horn.
- Ooh, that small?

307
00:21:45,469 --> 00:21:47,737
Boasting again?
[General chuckling]

308
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:50,273
[Borgia clears his throat]

309
00:22:13,397 --> 00:22:16,232
Oh, go on.
The suspense is killing them.

310
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:24,874
Habet duos testiculos...

311
00:22:24,908 --> 00:22:28,711
...et bene pendentes.
[Applause]

312
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:31,214
So, he's got two testicles,
well hung.

313
00:22:31,248 --> 00:22:33,149
Deo gracias.

314
00:22:33,183 --> 00:22:35,918
[Crowd murmuring]

315
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:39,756
[Bells ringing]
[Applause and cheering]

316
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:47,530
[Bells ringing]

317
00:22:47,564 --> 00:22:50,166
[Cheering continues]

318
00:23:28,405 --> 00:23:32,408
Habemus papam!

319
00:23:32,443 --> 00:23:34,444
[Cheering]

320
00:23:50,527 --> 00:23:56,332
[Borgia]: Pater, et filius,
et Spiritus Sanctus.

321
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:58,868
Amen.

322
00:23:58,902 --> 00:24:03,072
...tu es et dominus eternum...
[Pleasurable moaning]

323
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:07,610
...et Spiritus Sancti.
[Laughing]

324
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:09,812
Amen.
Oh!

325
00:24:12,816 --> 00:24:16,853
Your sins are all forgiven,
sisters.

326
00:24:16,887 --> 00:24:20,123
[Laughing]
By the pope's bastard?

327
00:24:20,157 --> 00:24:23,226
Son!
His favourite son!

328
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,761
[Gasping]

329
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:33,770
[Cesare]: I ask to confess
to you, Holy Father,

330
00:24:33,804 --> 00:24:38,274
because...
I have sinned.

331
00:24:38,308 --> 00:24:40,610
How have you sinned, my son?

332
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:43,613
I have corrupted my soul.

333
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:46,082
I have pledged estates, castles,

334
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:48,451
benefices
to your brother cardinals.

335
00:24:48,485 --> 00:24:54,223
I have transferred the documents in the
innards of roasted beasts and fowls.

336
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:57,126
All to secure
your election as pope.

337
00:24:57,161 --> 00:25:00,430
And God will repay us tenfold.

338
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:05,568
But you must set my soul
at ease, Father.

339
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:10,339
Can a family such as ours
survive such a prize?

340
00:25:10,374 --> 00:25:13,609
We are Spaniards.
They hate us.

341
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:18,948
The enemies we have at present
will be multiplied tenfold.

342
00:25:18,982 --> 00:25:21,751
God will protect his Vicar
on Earth, Cesare,

343
00:25:21,785 --> 00:25:26,556
- and those dearest to him. - And will you
inform God as to His duties in this regard?

344
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:30,426
Why this blasphemous tone,
my son?

345
00:25:30,461 --> 00:25:33,830
Because I swear, if God
does not protect us, I shall.

346
00:25:33,864 --> 00:25:37,133
You are a bishop, Cesare.
You have no need of such temporal thoughts.

347
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:39,669
You placed this collar
round my neck, Father.

348
00:25:39,703 --> 00:25:41,838
You made God my calling.

349
00:25:41,872 --> 00:25:46,108
But the sins I've committed for
you must convince you, surely,

350
00:25:46,143 --> 00:25:49,645
that the Church is
not my calling.

351
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:55,184
I beg you now to release me of my vows.
Let me live as a layman.

352
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:57,420
As a soldier.

353
00:25:57,454 --> 00:26:00,957
I can then protect our family from the
storm that surely must engulf it.

354
00:26:00,991 --> 00:26:05,061
You are my eldest son, Cesare. You were
always destined to be a prince of the Church.

355
00:26:05,095 --> 00:26:08,631
I would be a prince of state,
Father, and I think you know that.

356
00:26:08,665 --> 00:26:12,068
The papal army is small, Cesare.

357
00:26:12,102 --> 00:26:16,072
The battles I will fight will be
within these sacred walls.

358
00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:19,842
This is where I will need
your help. Juan can...

359
00:26:19,877 --> 00:26:23,579
...bear arms for the Borgia family, and
lead whatever army the pope has,

360
00:26:23,614 --> 00:26:26,282
and I will not have my authority
questioned further on this.

361
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:31,120
Ego te absolvo ab omnibus
censuris, et peccatis,

362
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:36,359
in nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.

363
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:44,233
[Swords clashing]
[Grunting with effort]

364
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:55,177
You think it fits me, brother?

365
00:26:55,212 --> 00:26:57,713
You have broad shoulders.

366
00:26:57,748 --> 00:26:59,715
As have you.

367
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,118
Though it lacks an insignia.

368
00:27:02,152 --> 00:27:04,720
I thought a cape
to cover the breastplate,

369
00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:06,889
with the Borgia Bull
in bright yellow.

370
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:09,592
I favour black, myself.

371
00:27:09,626 --> 00:27:12,728
Black for the cleric,
but for the soldier,

372
00:27:12,763 --> 00:27:14,830
a prancing bull in yellow.

373
00:27:14,865 --> 00:27:18,234
Or red, perhaps?

374
00:27:18,268 --> 00:27:20,603
Black.

375
00:27:20,637 --> 00:27:23,072
It suits you.

376
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:37,587
[Giggling]

377
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:41,157
- Welcome, Papa.
- Oh, I've missed you.

378
00:27:41,191 --> 00:27:44,160
- [Woman]: So, you have won.
- Yes, I've won.

379
00:27:44,194 --> 00:27:46,862
You've won
what you always wanted.

380
00:27:46,897 --> 00:27:48,898
My congratulations.

381
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:54,203
And I have...
lost.

382
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:57,373
- But what have you lost, my love?
- You.

383
00:27:57,407 --> 00:27:59,842
You'll never lose me.

384
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:04,780
[Bell tolling]
In spirit, maybe, but...

385
00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:07,650
in the flesh, I may have to.

386
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:09,785
The pope cannot love?

387
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,021
The pope can love God.

388
00:28:12,055 --> 00:28:14,790
But to be seen
to love anyone else would be...

389
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:17,526
...unthinkable.

390
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:21,764
So we'll find ways
to accommodate our affections.

391
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:24,967
Something like we've always done.

392
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:30,206
All of Rome knows you're
the mother to my children.

393
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,877
Not only must the pope be chaste;
he must be seen to be chaste.

394
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:37,413
The children.

395
00:28:37,447 --> 00:28:40,149
You can be seen to love them, no?

396
00:28:40,183 --> 00:28:41,917
Of course!

397
00:28:46,623 --> 00:28:51,093
I always knew
this day would come.

398
00:28:51,128 --> 00:28:53,596
As long as you are with me
in spirit...

399
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:56,666
- I always will be.
- And with no one else.

400
00:28:59,536 --> 00:29:03,205
That is equally impossible,
Vannozza.

401
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,344
So we take vows of chastity
along with your new status?

402
00:29:08,378 --> 00:29:11,213
Must we take vows of poverty too?

403
00:29:11,248 --> 00:29:13,482
Poverty?

404
00:29:13,517 --> 00:29:16,452
God forbid!

405
00:29:16,486 --> 00:29:19,021
For the ceremonial processions,

406
00:29:19,056 --> 00:29:24,393
horses, arms and livery
for 700 priests and 23 cardinals

407
00:29:24,428 --> 00:29:27,763
with their retinues,
knights, and grandees.

408
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:30,566
For Pope Alexander,
a ceremonial throne

409
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,703
constructed by Florentine
master builders,

410
00:29:33,737 --> 00:29:36,005
gold and silver plated.

411
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:38,607
[Drumming and cheering]
For the Borgia family,

412
00:29:38,642 --> 00:29:41,610
a brocaded carriage, gold inlaid,

413
00:29:41,645 --> 00:29:46,048
refurbished in Venice.
You look beautiful, Mother.

414
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,718
But you must try to remember
you're not in mourning.

415
00:29:48,752 --> 00:29:50,419
But perhaps I am.

416
00:29:52,422 --> 00:29:55,057
Like you are losing your family?

417
00:29:55,092 --> 00:29:57,059
The life we have lived.

418
00:29:57,094 --> 00:29:59,228
What are we gaining?

419
00:29:59,262 --> 00:30:01,230
The future.

420
00:30:01,264 --> 00:30:03,199
[Crowd cheering]

421
00:30:03,233 --> 00:30:06,302
[Bells ringing]

422
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:10,339
d
[Choral music]

423
00:30:26,056 --> 00:30:29,058
[Cheering and applause]

424
00:30:33,396 --> 00:30:36,398
[Bells ringing]

425
00:30:40,737 --> 00:30:43,706
Step! Step!

426
00:32:45,128 --> 00:32:47,596
Take the tiara...

427
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:51,233
...which is ornamented
with three crowns...

428
00:32:51,268 --> 00:32:53,302
...and be aware...

429
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:56,872
that you are father
of kings and monarchs,

430
00:32:56,907 --> 00:32:59,975
lord of the globe,

431
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:05,114
earthly resident
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

432
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:07,216
our Redeemer,

433
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,419
who shall have the power

434
00:33:10,453 --> 00:33:15,557
and the glory forever and ever.

435
00:33:18,428 --> 00:33:19,929
Amen.

436
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:25,034
His Holiness,

437
00:33:25,068 --> 00:33:27,069
Pope...

438
00:33:27,103 --> 00:33:30,072
...Alexander Sixtus.

439
00:33:30,106 --> 00:33:34,076
That is so many titles, Cesare.

440
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:37,579
What will his family
call him now?

441
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:39,715
Holy Father.

442
00:33:39,749 --> 00:33:42,918
Holy Father.

443
00:33:42,953 --> 00:33:44,753
That's easy.

444
00:33:44,788 --> 00:33:46,255
Even I can remember that.

445
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:49,291
...grants to all faithful
here present

446
00:33:49,326 --> 00:33:51,393
a plenary indulgence...

447
00:33:51,428 --> 00:33:54,596
- And tell me, dear brother...
- What, sis?

448
00:33:54,631 --> 00:33:57,766
What must I call myself?

449
00:33:57,801 --> 00:33:59,301
Holy Daughter?

450
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:02,438
You are still
Lucrezia Borgia, my love.

451
00:34:02,472 --> 00:34:05,474
You will only change your name
when you marry.

452
00:34:05,508 --> 00:34:08,978
- And when will I marry?
- Never, if I can help it.

453
00:34:09,012 --> 00:34:12,081
But surely it is good
to marry, Cesare?

454
00:34:14,084 --> 00:34:15,784
As the pope's daughter,

455
00:34:15,819 --> 00:34:19,321
you will have every prince
of Europe vying for your hand.

456
00:34:21,992 --> 00:34:25,561
They may care very little
for your heart.

457
00:34:25,595 --> 00:34:28,697
Perhaps I should do
as you have done, brother...

458
00:34:28,732 --> 00:34:32,234
take Holy Orders.
Give my heart to God.

459
00:34:32,268 --> 00:34:35,037
That might be
the safer option, my love.

460
00:34:35,071 --> 00:34:38,040
Does Papa have so many enemies?

461
00:34:38,074 --> 00:34:40,943
As our father, perhaps not.

462
00:34:40,977 --> 00:34:42,945
But as pope...

463
00:34:42,979 --> 00:34:46,982
I am Rodrigo Borgia no longer.

464
00:34:47,017 --> 00:34:50,452
I am Alexander Sixtus.

465
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:52,721
But you know who you are.

466
00:34:52,756 --> 00:34:55,424
My father, still.

467
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:59,595
I am no longer "I".
I am... "we".

468
00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:01,597
[Sighing]

469
00:35:01,631 --> 00:35:06,869
We felt so...
alone out there.

470
00:35:06,903 --> 00:35:10,272
When the crown touched our head.

471
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:16,078
Humbled, even.

472
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:21,650
- Even frightened.
- You surprise me, Father.

473
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,223
You would surprise yourself if such
destiny ever brushed against you.

474
00:35:32,262 --> 00:35:34,263
Quite alone...

475
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:41,070
...with just the...

476
00:35:41,104 --> 00:35:44,006
...silence of God...

477
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,076
...as your witness.

478
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:50,079
But He must already be
pleased, Holy Father.

479
00:35:50,113 --> 00:35:52,581
[Sighing with relief] Ahhh!

480
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:55,717
Indeed?
[Inhaling deeply]

481
00:35:55,752 --> 00:35:57,719
Why?

482
00:35:57,754 --> 00:36:01,457
Because the earth has
not yet swallowed us.

483
00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:08,564
Here we are.

484
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:13,569
You must help me, Cesare.

485
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:17,940
You must help me interpret...

486
00:36:17,974 --> 00:36:20,442
...the great silence
of God.

487
00:36:22,412 --> 00:36:24,980
[Cesare]: Wait!
Let me!

488
00:36:28,718 --> 00:36:32,588
- Come.
- Help me... do His will.

489
00:36:35,058 --> 00:36:37,693
We have been entrusted...

490
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:41,029
...with the keys
to His kingdom.

491
00:36:41,064 --> 00:36:44,366
The King of France must be
aware, Ambassador,

492
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,704
that we have placed the papal
mitre in the hands of an ape.

493
00:36:48,738 --> 00:36:53,575
He has hopes, Cardinal, that the
office brings its own grace with it,

494
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:56,712
and that the grace of God can
transform the worst of men.

495
00:36:56,746 --> 00:36:58,380
And if it doesn't?

496
00:36:58,414 --> 00:37:02,618
We will observe with interest
what harm a mitred ape can do.

497
00:37:02,652 --> 00:37:04,753
Hm.

498
00:37:04,787 --> 00:37:07,322
These offices we grant
in the full expectation

499
00:37:07,357 --> 00:37:10,159
they will be used wisely
for the restoration

500
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:12,995
of the honour
of our Holy Mother Church.

501
00:37:13,029 --> 00:37:14,396
Dominus vobiscum.

502
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:17,900
- [All]: Dominus vobiscum.
- And, finally,

503
00:37:17,934 --> 00:37:24,106
the greatest office in our gift,
the post of Vice-Chancellor,

504
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:28,043
the office that stands
a reed's width

505
00:37:28,077 --> 00:37:30,445
from our papacy.

506
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,382
We grant...

507
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:36,485
...the most august,
the most valued colleague,

508
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:42,024
the brightest hope
for the future of the Church,

509
00:37:42,058 --> 00:37:44,393
Cardinal...

510
00:37:44,427 --> 00:37:47,262
...Ascanio Sforza.

511
00:37:47,297 --> 00:37:49,631
[Cardinals murmuring]

512
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:54,870
Simony!

513
00:37:54,904 --> 00:37:57,239
I charge you now in public

514
00:37:57,273 --> 00:38:02,778
with trading sacred offices
like a market huckster!

515
00:38:02,812 --> 00:38:05,981
May I remind the cardinal
he is in consistry.

516
00:38:06,015 --> 00:38:08,183
Perhaps we misheard him.

517
00:38:08,218 --> 00:38:11,353
That office was promised to me.

518
00:38:11,387 --> 00:38:14,523
Ah.
Did you pay for it?

519
00:38:14,557 --> 00:38:17,526
With my acceptance
of your foul election.

520
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,530
When the pope pledges
to banish all suspicion

521
00:38:21,564 --> 00:38:25,534
of simony from the cardinalate,
he keeps his word.

522
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:29,338
God has chosen us as a new broom

523
00:38:29,372 --> 00:38:33,642
to sweep the Vatican clean
of corruption, which is

524
00:38:33,676 --> 00:38:37,479
precisely why we choose one
who has no expectation

525
00:38:37,513 --> 00:38:42,684
of advancement...
Cardinal Sforza.

526
00:38:50,026 --> 00:38:54,830
And I pray I may prove worthy
of the honour.

527
00:38:54,864 --> 00:38:58,800
And I pray so too.

528
00:38:58,835 --> 00:39:00,736
In fact,

529
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:05,474
I fully approve
of his new... broom.

530
00:39:05,508 --> 00:39:09,511
[Cardinals muttering]

531
00:39:11,514 --> 00:39:13,615
Kiss the ring, you fool.

532
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:19,288
As do I.

533
00:39:21,457 --> 00:39:27,829
And I deeply regret
my recent intemperance.

534
00:39:27,864 --> 00:39:35,003
In honour of his appointment,
I invite Cardinal Sforza,

535
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:37,839
and Your Holiness

536
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:40,342
and the College of Cardinals

537
00:39:40,376 --> 00:39:43,045
to a banquet at my palace

538
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:45,947
in two days' time.

539
00:39:45,982 --> 00:39:48,216
[Cardinals murmuring]

540
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:05,701
Are you going
to share it with me?

541
00:40:05,735 --> 00:40:09,071
Share what, Holy Father?

542
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:12,407
Why you bring a monkey
to a banquet?

543
00:40:12,442 --> 00:40:18,046
Oh, I fear the other cardinals might not
share your appetite for reformation.

544
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:19,881
And your monkey does?

545
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:24,252
Why, yes. He is an excellent
judge of appetite.

546
00:40:24,287 --> 00:40:25,754
Huh!

547
00:40:25,788 --> 00:40:29,591
Reform to our Holy Mother Church
may happen slowly, but...

548
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:33,995
God has spoken to me as he spoke
to my predecessor, Pope Innocent.

549
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,098
Happen it must.

550
00:40:36,132 --> 00:40:41,002
Shall we dine on gruel
tonight, then, Your Holiness?

551
00:40:41,037 --> 00:40:46,675
- I could inform my cooks. - We are your guests
tonight, My Lord Cardinal. We will dine

552
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:48,343
according to your choosing.

553
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:51,513
Thank goodness.
I can have the wine poured?

554
00:40:51,547 --> 00:40:53,148
Let me taste that.

555
00:40:53,182 --> 00:40:57,018
It is of an excellent vintage,
My Lord.

556
00:40:57,053 --> 00:41:00,288
I have no doubt.

557
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:04,860
Oh!
[Laughing]

558
00:41:04,894 --> 00:41:07,129
And how is his palate?

559
00:41:11,701 --> 00:41:14,469
Well, it's superb.

560
00:41:14,504 --> 00:41:17,506
- He salutes your good taste.
- Thank you.

561
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,308
A great wine,
like the papacy itself...

562
00:41:20,343 --> 00:41:22,677
mature, rounded,

563
00:41:22,712 --> 00:41:25,814
its roots in the soil,
its bouquet in the heavens,

564
00:41:25,848 --> 00:41:28,016
consumed by a monkey.

565
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:32,954
I suspect a metaphor is
lurking there, My Lord Cardinal?

566
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:36,458
We are but animals
blessed with an eternal soul.

567
00:41:36,492 --> 00:41:39,694
There go we,
but for the grace of God.

568
00:41:39,729 --> 00:41:42,831
[Cesare]: It seems nature,
not metaphor, calls.

569
00:41:42,865 --> 00:41:46,835
[Laughing]
He begs Your Lordship's pardon.

570
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:49,671
[Laughing]
Excuse me.

571
00:41:49,705 --> 00:41:51,940
Excuse my monkey.

572
00:41:57,213 --> 00:41:59,214
Why such a hurry?

573
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:31,112
- My God, you're fast.
- For a cook.

574
00:42:31,147 --> 00:42:33,148
And you for a cleric.

575
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:38,386
On kitchen duty?

576
00:42:38,421 --> 00:42:41,590
For tonight.

577
00:42:41,624 --> 00:42:45,794
- Who pays you?
- Cardinal Orsini.

578
00:42:45,828 --> 00:42:49,130
Whatever you're being paid,
I'll double it.

579
00:42:49,165 --> 00:42:51,933
- I could use someone that fast.
- You could?

580
00:42:51,968 --> 00:42:53,969
Oh, yeah.

581
00:43:00,076 --> 00:43:02,944
But not that stupid!

582
00:43:05,281 --> 00:43:09,351
Far from stupidity, sire.

583
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:14,189
I imagine from your offer
that you have need of me, yes?

584
00:43:14,223 --> 00:43:19,628
So to kill the servant you have
need of would indeed be stupid.

585
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:25,400
Call me stupid, then.
Tell me, tell me why I shouldn't. Hmm?

586
00:43:25,434 --> 00:43:28,937
Because of the sixth commandment,
thou shalt not kill.

587
00:43:28,971 --> 00:43:32,073
I'll be forgiven.
The pope is my confessor.

588
00:43:34,076 --> 00:43:38,880
Because you'll never meet
another assassin like me.

589
00:43:40,883 --> 00:43:45,186
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

590
00:43:48,257 --> 00:43:50,258
[Grunting furiously]

591
00:44:09,612 --> 00:44:14,182
- But we were talking terms, yes?
- We were.

592
00:44:16,185 --> 00:44:19,654
I would gladly work
for the pope or the pope's son,

593
00:44:19,689 --> 00:44:24,225
for these cardinals can,
as you know, prove fickle,

594
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,361
and it seems
someone as pitiless as you...

595
00:44:26,395 --> 00:44:31,700
- Yes?
- Needs someone as pitiless as me.

596
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:33,368
Elaborate.

597
00:44:33,402 --> 00:44:39,474
I have smothered infants
in their beds.

598
00:44:39,508 --> 00:44:43,044
But only
when their parents paid me.

599
00:44:46,682 --> 00:44:48,650
And in the powder?

600
00:44:48,684 --> 00:44:51,252
Eternal life.

601
00:44:53,255 --> 00:44:57,025
- For whom?
- You. Your father.

602
00:44:59,528 --> 00:45:00,996
It's not very subtle.

603
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:04,099
No subtlety needed tonight.

604
00:45:04,133 --> 00:45:06,267
They all want you dead.

605
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:25,520
Serve this...

606
00:45:25,554 --> 00:45:27,555
...to Orsini.

607
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:40,835
[Quiet murmuring]

608
00:46:08,197 --> 00:46:10,732
Your Grace.

609
00:46:10,766 --> 00:46:13,001
You are bleeding.

610
00:46:15,004 --> 00:46:17,305
Damned monkey bit me.

611
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:21,810
Animals will do that.
They lack soul.

612
00:46:21,844 --> 00:46:25,213
I propose a toast.

613
00:46:25,247 --> 00:46:26,815
To harmony,

614
00:46:26,849 --> 00:46:28,950
amongst us,

615
00:46:28,984 --> 00:46:31,419
servants of God.

616
00:46:31,454 --> 00:46:37,325
- Harmony. - To the communion of saints
and the forgiveness of sins.

617
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:38,827
Amen.

618
00:46:38,861 --> 00:46:40,061
Amen.

619
00:46:48,404 --> 00:46:52,607
I'd like to propose
a second toast. To metaphor.

620
00:46:52,641 --> 00:46:55,844
- [Cesare]: Why metaphor?
- Because she's so

621
00:46:55,878 --> 00:47:00,715
infinitely pliable. A prince
one minute, a monkey the next.

622
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:06,921
And what her hidden meaning is only
God in His infinite wisdom knows.

623
00:47:11,193 --> 00:47:14,362
I propose another toast.

624
00:47:14,396 --> 00:47:17,799
- To monkeys.
- Monkeys?

625
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:20,368
They lick your hand one minute,

626
00:47:20,402 --> 00:47:26,708
bite your neck the next. And everyone knows
what you do with the monkey that bites you.

627
00:47:26,742 --> 00:47:29,544
And what do you do
with the monkey that bites you?

628
00:47:29,578 --> 00:47:31,813
[Choking]
Your Eminence, you're ill.

629
00:47:31,847 --> 00:47:33,448
You wring its neck.

630
00:47:38,053 --> 00:47:42,056
- [Orsini]: Poison.
- Poison!

631
00:47:42,091 --> 00:47:44,092
I accuse!

632
00:47:44,126 --> 00:47:46,628
The cooks?
Come, Father.

633
00:47:46,662 --> 00:47:49,063
[Choking]

634
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,868
[Man]: Send for help!

635
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:01,676
- The poison was meant for us.
- That's not possible.

636
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,611
We were saved by a monkey,
Father.

637
00:48:03,646 --> 00:48:05,113
You don't poison the pope!

638
00:48:05,147 --> 00:48:07,115
Are you aware
what the gossips call you?

639
00:48:07,149 --> 00:48:10,185
The mitred ape. Half of Rome was
waiting to celebrate this outcome...

640
00:48:10,219 --> 00:48:12,987
You poison a rat,
you poison a rabid dog!

641
00:48:13,022 --> 00:48:16,090
Not the Vicar of Rome,
not the heir to St. Peter!

642
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:18,226
- [Man]: Bring my carriage!
- The idea offends you?

643
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:21,129
It offends me, it offends
nature, it offends God Himself!

644
00:48:21,163 --> 00:48:27,068
- So, God will take His revenge, then.
- Yes, He will. With our help.

645
00:48:27,102 --> 00:48:29,237
- Go!
- [Man]: Yah!

646
00:48:36,846 --> 00:48:38,313
Excellent service.

647
00:48:38,347 --> 00:48:41,816
- I fear it is not over yet.
- What do you mean?

648
00:48:41,851 --> 00:48:45,286
Well, there's more to your Borgia
family than father and son.

649
00:48:45,321 --> 00:48:49,457
- What do you mean?
- I mean we must hurry, My Lord.

650
00:48:49,491 --> 00:48:51,860
Your whole family's in danger.

651
00:49:04,273 --> 00:49:06,241
- Micheletto!
- Am I too late?

652
00:49:06,275 --> 00:49:08,877
- We were waiting for you.
- Then you're too late!

653
00:49:08,911 --> 00:49:12,213
[Groaning in pain]
What are you doing?!

654
00:49:12,248 --> 00:49:13,882
Ah!

655
00:49:13,916 --> 00:49:15,817
[Yelling]

656
00:49:20,256 --> 00:49:21,756
Allow me, My Lord.

657
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,158
[Muffled yelling]

658
00:49:31,767 --> 00:49:34,903
Guards!

659
00:49:34,937 --> 00:49:37,972
- [Guard]: General!
- With me, quickly!

660
00:49:38,007 --> 00:49:40,441
Come on!

661
00:49:40,476 --> 00:49:43,611
Get out of my way!

662
00:49:49,151 --> 00:49:51,686
Pray somewhere else, Cardinals.

663
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:56,491
Arrest this household.

664
00:49:58,961 --> 00:50:01,963
You planned this massacre
thoroughly.

665
00:50:01,997 --> 00:50:03,631
If I had planned it, My Lord,

666
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:06,868
believe me, we would not be
having this conversation.

667
00:50:06,902 --> 00:50:09,904
You're that meticulous?

668
00:50:09,939 --> 00:50:12,807
Always.
[Grunting with effort]

669
00:50:12,841 --> 00:50:15,143
And o planned it?

670
00:50:18,414 --> 00:50:21,950
Cardinal Orsini.

671
00:50:21,984 --> 00:50:23,484
And Della Rovere?

672
00:50:26,221 --> 00:50:29,557
I know nothing of him.

673
00:50:29,591 --> 00:50:31,059
In this affair,

674
00:50:31,093 --> 00:50:33,628
[Panting]

675
00:50:33,662 --> 00:50:36,464
I had but one master.

676
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:39,600
And now?

677
00:50:39,635 --> 00:50:44,639
And now I am like a stray dog,

678
00:50:44,673 --> 00:50:46,507
masterless.

679
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:52,313
Unless your kind offer
still stands.

680
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:56,351
You could have...
let things take their course...

681
00:50:56,385 --> 00:50:58,653
Betrayed me.

682
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:02,323
- Most of your kind do.
- My kind?

683
00:51:02,358 --> 00:51:06,260
I do not have a kind.

684
00:51:09,965 --> 00:51:12,934
And I suspect neither do you.

685
00:51:16,338 --> 00:51:19,607
Your name, sweet assassin.

686
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,415
[Panting]

687
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:29,384
Micheletto.

688
00:51:29,418 --> 00:51:32,387
You must prove yourself
worthy of my trust, th.

689
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:37,225
- This is not proof enough?
- Perhaps. Perhaps not.

690
00:51:37,259 --> 00:51:41,596
- Can you dispose of these corpses?
- You would keep them secret?

691
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:43,865
More than that.
I would keep you secret.

692
00:51:46,702 --> 00:51:50,838
Dump them in the Tiber.
Meet me by the Vatican gates

693
00:51:50,873 --> 00:51:54,742
in two hours' time. We shall
discuss your future service.

694
00:52:01,283 --> 00:52:04,185
[Whispering]: Mother.

695
00:52:04,219 --> 00:52:08,156
Are you trying to frighten me?

696
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:10,191
I'm sorry, Mother.

697
00:52:12,361 --> 00:52:15,630
Why are you here, Cesare?

698
00:52:15,664 --> 00:52:18,099
I imagine things...

699
00:52:18,133 --> 00:52:20,168
murders,

700
00:52:20,202 --> 00:52:22,770
blood-spattered throats,

701
00:52:22,805 --> 00:52:25,506
poisoned chalices.

702
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:29,544
Perhaps you're not wrong.
We have many enemies now.

703
00:52:32,214 --> 00:52:33,681
And Lucrezia?

704
00:52:33,715 --> 00:52:38,186
She's sleeping.
You miss her that much?

705
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,354
Always.

706
00:52:40,389 --> 00:52:43,858
If anything happened
to her, I'd...

707
00:52:43,892 --> 00:52:45,927
...I'd die.

708
00:52:45,961 --> 00:52:49,030
What could possibly happen?

709
00:52:49,064 --> 00:52:52,033
I'm putting a guard on the house.

710
00:52:52,067 --> 00:52:54,535
Is it so dangerous outside?

711
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:56,537
We are in a different city now.

712
00:52:56,572 --> 00:52:59,307
Is it still called Rome?

713
00:52:59,341 --> 00:53:01,843
I'm not sure it has a name.

714
00:53:04,012 --> 00:53:06,981
Father.

715
00:53:07,015 --> 00:53:09,650
Father!

716
00:53:09,685 --> 00:53:11,652
Father, I've had to place
a guard on the...

717
00:53:11,687 --> 00:53:16,124
The good cardinal, my son,
has been expressing his shock

718
00:53:16,158 --> 00:53:19,494
and dismay
at this evening's outcome.

719
00:53:19,528 --> 00:53:21,662
Poison, it seems, was the cause

720
00:53:21,697 --> 00:53:24,132
of Cardinal Orsini's demise.

721
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:26,167
One shudders at the thought.

722
00:53:26,201 --> 00:53:27,735
As to who poisoned him,

723
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:30,838
I have no idea.
Perhaps we should

724
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:34,308
ask ourselves, who benefits most
from his death?

725
00:53:34,343 --> 00:53:36,377
And what are you implying,
Your Eminence?

726
00:53:36,411 --> 00:53:39,046
I am implying nothing.

727
00:53:39,081 --> 00:53:41,916
I am merely offering
His Holiness any help I can

728
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:44,352
in unmasking the culprit.

729
00:53:44,386 --> 00:53:48,623
Our Holy Mother Church can
afford no such scandals.

730
00:53:53,228 --> 00:53:57,865
We have Orsini's household
staff in irons, Your Holiness.

731
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,369
- Cardinal.
- The good cardinal, my brother,

732
00:54:01,403 --> 00:54:05,940
has offered to help us unmask
the culprit behind this plot.

733
00:54:05,974 --> 00:54:09,410
We apprehended this wretch
skulking outside by the gate.

734
00:54:09,444 --> 00:54:12,213
A plot, by definition,
needs more than one participant,

735
00:54:12,247 --> 00:54:15,750
- does it not?
- Do you recognize him?

736
00:54:23,091 --> 00:54:26,093
Didn't he pour the wine?

737
00:54:26,128 --> 00:54:29,230
[Cesare]: Do you know
this man, Cardinal Della Rovere?

738
00:54:29,264 --> 00:54:31,499
I know he attended
at the cardinal's table,

739
00:54:31,533 --> 00:54:32,967
but there were many of those.

740
00:54:33,001 --> 00:54:38,139
Beyond that, nothing.

741
00:54:38,173 --> 00:54:41,175
If this creature is
indeed the poisoner,

742
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:45,379
some hours on the strappado
should loosen his tongue.

743
00:54:45,414 --> 00:54:46,914
See if he talks.

744
00:54:50,852 --> 00:54:53,955
[Grunting]

745
00:54:53,989 --> 00:54:56,157
I have a dilemma:

746
00:54:56,191 --> 00:54:58,426
[Grunting]

747
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,962
whether to flay you at night...

748
00:55:00,996 --> 00:55:02,997
[Grunting]

749
00:55:03,031 --> 00:55:04,932
...or at dawn.

750
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:07,301
[Grunting]

751
00:55:07,336 --> 00:55:09,303
[Groaning]

752
00:55:09,338 --> 00:55:12,340
- I pity you your dilemma, My Lord.
- Pity yourself.

753
00:55:12,374 --> 00:55:15,943
Brother. You have
already exhausted yourself

754
00:55:15,978 --> 00:55:17,445
in our father's defence.

755
00:55:17,479 --> 00:55:19,981
Now I could spend a good hour
questioning this man.

756
00:55:20,015 --> 00:55:22,016
Is that really a task
for a cleric?

757
00:55:25,287 --> 00:55:27,255
[Grunting in pain]

758
00:55:32,628 --> 00:55:35,596
Lock the door and go.

759
00:55:35,631 --> 00:55:38,199
Up.

760
00:55:38,233 --> 00:55:39,734
Up!

761
00:55:44,306 --> 00:55:46,774
Would you have talked?

762
00:55:46,808 --> 00:55:49,644
Only to sing your praises,
My Lord.

763
00:55:53,482 --> 00:55:56,150
Still want to earn my trust?

764
00:55:58,153 --> 00:56:00,955
Eternally, My Lord.

765
00:56:00,989 --> 00:56:03,658
Lie low for a day, then.

766
00:56:03,692 --> 00:56:07,361
I can have word sent out
that you couldn't be broken.

767
00:56:09,598 --> 00:56:11,732
And then?

768
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:13,634
Then...

769
00:56:13,669 --> 00:56:17,905
...get close to Cardinal
Della Rovere.

770
00:56:17,939 --> 00:56:21,609
Tell me what he thinks.
What he plans.

771
00:56:26,281 --> 00:56:28,783
Then you must hurt me, My Lord.

772
00:56:30,786 --> 00:56:33,587
Haven't I hurt you
enough already?

773
00:56:33,622 --> 00:56:37,792
To convince this cardinal,
my back must tell its own story.

774
00:56:40,462 --> 00:56:42,763
And I have heard
that he has an interest

775
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:45,333
in the male torso.

776
00:56:48,303 --> 00:56:53,307
And even I cannot
convincingly whip myself.

777
00:56:57,312 --> 00:56:59,313
So whip me, My Lord.

778
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:10,658
[Grunting]

779
00:57:10,692 --> 00:57:12,560
Harder.

780
00:57:14,563 --> 00:57:16,831
[Grunting]

781
00:57:16,865 --> 00:57:18,432
Harder, My Lord.

782
00:57:20,435 --> 00:57:22,069
[Grunting]

783
00:57:22,104 --> 00:57:23,637
And...

784
00:57:23,672 --> 00:57:27,441
[Grunting]
...if you betray me...

785
00:57:27,476 --> 00:57:29,443
[Grunting]

786
00:57:29,478 --> 00:57:31,912
...you will end your days
on that rack.

787
00:57:31,947 --> 00:57:35,082
[Grunting] Then it would not be
in my interest to betray you,

788
00:57:35,117 --> 00:57:38,085
- My Lord.
- Good.

789
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,854
[Grunting]

790
00:57:39,888 --> 00:57:41,889
Again!

791
00:57:41,923 --> 00:57:45,926
[Grunting]

792
00:57:45,961 --> 00:57:47,528
Again.

793
00:57:47,562 --> 00:57:49,530
[Grunting]

794
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:52,800
[Door opening]

795
00:57:58,106 --> 00:58:01,909
Do you have something to tell me?

796
00:58:01,943 --> 00:58:04,211
About the night's events?

797
00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:09,049
Only that...

798
00:58:11,052 --> 00:58:13,053
...I will protect you.

799
00:58:13,088 --> 00:58:16,090
Protect our family.

800
00:58:16,124 --> 00:58:18,959
With my life if needs be.

801
00:58:24,065 --> 00:58:28,369
Well, all of the others bought
and sold.

802
00:58:28,403 --> 00:58:32,006
We merely proved ourselves
better at the game.

803
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,176
But we draw the line

804
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:39,046
at murder, do we not?

805
00:58:43,218 --> 00:58:47,254
Orsini drew no such line.

806
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,231
I see.

807
00:59:01,236 --> 00:59:03,337
So,

808
00:59:03,371 --> 00:59:06,674
we are one less cardinal
this morning.

809
00:59:12,848 --> 00:59:16,317
I was your age
when I became a cardinal.

810
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,185
Seems like yesterday.

811
00:59:20,188 --> 00:59:21,722
This red...

812
00:59:21,756 --> 00:59:25,926
...signifies that you are ready
to spill your blood in defence

813
00:59:25,961 --> 00:59:29,163
of the Christian faith.

814
00:59:29,197 --> 00:59:32,700
- No, Father.
- Are you, my son, ready

815
00:59:32,734 --> 00:59:36,003
to spill your blood in defence
of the Christian faith?

816
00:59:36,037 --> 00:59:37,705
I think you are!

817
00:59:37,739 --> 00:59:39,707
For the defence
of my family, perhaps.

818
00:59:39,741 --> 00:59:41,942
- That too.
- Give me control

819
00:59:41,977 --> 00:59:45,212
- of the papal armies and I will protect
us all. - We will have one son

820
00:59:45,247 --> 00:59:47,948
in the cloth and one in armour.

821
00:59:47,983 --> 00:59:50,918
- You know our wishes.
- But a cardinal's red?

822
00:59:50,952 --> 00:59:53,087
And Lucrezia must marry.

823
00:59:53,121 --> 00:59:54,855
So soon?

824
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:58,259
- She is 14 years old.
- She is just a child.

825
00:59:58,293 --> 01:00:01,862
We must bind our enemies
to us. Make friends of them.

826
01:00:01,897 --> 01:00:04,498
And what better way is there
than marriage?

827
01:00:04,533 --> 01:00:08,936
You can perform the rite...
as cardinal.

828
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:12,873
Am I a cardinal already?

829
01:00:21,883 --> 01:00:24,051
And they tortured you for...

830
01:00:24,085 --> 01:00:27,021
...how long?

831
01:00:27,055 --> 01:00:30,591
A day and a night, Your Eminence.

832
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:36,530
And you revealed?

833
01:00:38,533 --> 01:00:41,535
There was nothing to reveal,
Your Eminence.

834
01:00:49,744 --> 01:00:51,745
Ecce homo.

835
01:00:54,249 --> 01:00:57,484
"Behold the man."

836
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:00,054
They scourged our saviour thus.

837
01:01:03,858 --> 01:01:07,962
Is it true,
what's being rumoured?

838
01:01:07,996 --> 01:01:12,333
That the good cardinal
inadvertently poisoned himself?

839
01:01:12,367 --> 01:01:15,002
Who would have profited
from his death?

840
01:01:15,036 --> 01:01:17,504
Certainly not Cardinal Orsini.

841
01:01:17,539 --> 01:01:21,442
- Who takes possession of his properties?
- Borgia.

842
01:01:21,476 --> 01:01:22,977
Well, then.

843
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:27,848
These methods are not mine.

844
01:01:27,882 --> 01:01:31,352
You think they are mine,
Your Eminence?

845
01:01:31,386 --> 01:01:34,021
What are your methods?

846
01:01:34,055 --> 01:01:36,190
Discretion.

847
01:01:36,224 --> 01:01:37,625
Silence.

848
01:01:37,659 --> 01:01:39,660
And you have suffered
for your silence.

849
01:01:41,663 --> 01:01:45,199
Why?

850
01:01:45,233 --> 01:01:47,468
Like you,

851
01:01:47,502 --> 01:01:50,371
I hate this Borgia.

852
01:01:52,407 --> 01:01:55,209
And if I can be of any use...

853
01:01:55,243 --> 01:01:59,546
I need someone I can trust.

854
01:01:59,581 --> 01:02:02,683
You can trust my hatred
of this Borgia pope.

855
01:02:07,922 --> 01:02:10,691
[Gasping in pain]

856
01:02:10,725 --> 01:02:14,862
I can trust these wounds
of yours.

857
01:02:19,701 --> 01:02:23,837
They will last for a lifetime,

858
01:02:23,872 --> 01:02:26,940
- Your Eminence.
- Indeed.

859
01:02:28,943 --> 01:02:31,912
I need to assemble a gathering
of every cardinal

860
01:02:31,946 --> 01:02:35,349
who shares your feelings.

861
01:02:35,383 --> 01:02:38,752
In absolute secrecy.

862
01:03:06,181 --> 01:03:10,851
May I thank you, Holy Father,
for bequeathing to me your precious time.

863
01:03:12,854 --> 01:03:16,156
Go on, my child.

864
01:03:16,191 --> 01:03:17,891
I have sinned mightily,

865
01:03:17,926 --> 01:03:20,227
Your Holiness,

866
01:03:20,261 --> 01:03:24,264
and know there are some sins
that only the pope can forgive.

867
01:03:24,299 --> 01:03:26,100
They are few,

868
01:03:26,134 --> 01:03:29,169
but the most grave.

869
01:03:31,172 --> 01:03:32,706
Tell me.

870
01:03:34,709 --> 01:03:38,011
My husband, Your Holiness,

871
01:03:38,046 --> 01:03:40,514
has long been...

872
01:03:40,548 --> 01:03:43,050
...distasteful to me.

873
01:03:43,084 --> 01:03:45,252
I fear...

874
01:03:45,286 --> 01:03:48,655
...you are not the first woman
to share that fate.

875
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:52,760
His person I find repellent.

876
01:03:52,794 --> 01:03:55,596
His advances sicken me.

877
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:59,633
His hand upon my body makes me
retch with disgust.

878
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:04,605
Have you denied him...

879
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:07,007
...your duties as a wife?

880
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:11,779
No, Your Holiness.

881
01:04:11,813 --> 01:04:15,883
I performed them
as the Church says I must.

882
01:04:15,917 --> 01:04:17,384
So I...

883
01:04:17,418 --> 01:04:20,120
...fail
to discern the sin.

884
01:04:24,626 --> 01:04:28,095
I found myself with child.

885
01:04:28,129 --> 01:04:30,430
The thought of this body of mine,

886
01:04:30,465 --> 01:04:33,300
marred by the presence
of his offspring...

887
01:04:35,303 --> 01:04:37,604
inside...

888
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:40,641
drove me to an act
of transgression that...

889
01:04:44,646 --> 01:04:46,980
Go on, my daughter.

890
01:04:49,484 --> 01:04:53,153
I put an end to my pregnancy.

891
01:04:55,323 --> 01:04:58,158
That is indeed most grave.

892
01:05:00,161 --> 01:05:02,129
A sin...

893
01:05:02,163 --> 01:05:04,565
...that only
the pope...

894
01:05:04,599 --> 01:05:07,935
...can forgive.
Only God may forgive.

895
01:05:09,938 --> 01:05:13,073
But we may intercede...

896
01:05:13,107 --> 01:05:16,310
...on your behalf.

897
01:05:20,215 --> 01:05:23,283
Then, please, Your Holiness,

898
01:05:23,318 --> 01:05:27,421
...beg for me His mercy.

899
01:05:27,455 --> 01:05:29,756
And...

900
01:05:29,791 --> 01:05:33,760
...your husband?
He knows of this?

901
01:05:33,795 --> 01:05:35,762
He knows nothing.

902
01:05:35,797 --> 01:05:40,000
He has retired to his castle
in Bassano.

903
01:05:40,034 --> 01:05:43,270
He satisfies his lust on me
no longer.

904
01:05:43,304 --> 01:05:45,205
And you are...

905
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:49,509
now... chaste?

906
01:05:52,947 --> 01:05:55,415
I have no one, Your Holiness.

907
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:58,919
Then perhaps
that is to be your penitence...

908
01:05:58,953 --> 01:06:04,091
to follow your husband
to Bassano, as is your duty.

909
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:07,094
I would prefer a life
of destitution, Your Holiness.

910
01:06:07,128 --> 01:06:09,096
Then love God.

911
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:12,900
And find peace
within the walls of a nunnery.

912
01:06:12,934 --> 01:06:16,003
Can one find peace
in such a love, Your Holiness?

913
01:06:16,037 --> 01:06:19,539
It is what we must do,

914
01:06:19,574 --> 01:06:22,809
Giulia Farnese.

915
01:06:28,049 --> 01:06:31,018
I fear
I may lack Your Holiness's will.

916
01:06:31,052 --> 01:06:35,622
I am still young, Your Holiness,

917
01:06:35,657 --> 01:06:38,125
and my body, I am sure,

918
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:40,794
could find, and give,
much happiness

919
01:06:40,828 --> 01:06:43,430
if my soul could find peace.

920
01:06:47,835 --> 01:06:49,937
Do you beg forgiveness from God

921
01:06:49,971 --> 01:06:51,939
for the enormity of your crime?

922
01:06:51,973 --> 01:06:54,308
I do so daily.

923
01:06:54,342 --> 01:06:57,144
Your Holiness, my soul yearns
for its punishment.

924
01:06:57,178 --> 01:07:00,113
Then you must fast.

925
01:07:00,148 --> 01:07:04,217
From matins till evensong.

926
01:07:04,252 --> 01:07:07,554
And flagellate your naked body
twice nightly.

927
01:07:07,588 --> 01:07:09,356
With knotted cord,

928
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:13,427
- Your Holiness?
- Cord of silk will suffice.

929
01:07:13,461 --> 01:07:17,097
To destroy the beauty
the Lord has granted you

930
01:07:17,131 --> 01:07:21,101
would be to compound your sin.

931
01:07:21,135 --> 01:07:23,303
E go te absolve...

932
01:07:23,338 --> 01:07:26,239
...ab omnibus censuris,
et peccatis,

933
01:07:26,274 --> 01:07:28,408
in nomine Patris,

934
01:07:28,443 --> 01:07:30,644
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

935
01:07:30,678 --> 01:07:33,180
- Amen.
- Amen.

936
01:07:41,022 --> 01:07:42,990
[Sighing]

937
01:07:43,024 --> 01:07:45,025
Giulia Farnese.

938
01:07:47,261 --> 01:07:48,829
Your Holiness?

939
01:07:50,832 --> 01:07:53,300
One of your lineage...

940
01:07:53,334 --> 01:07:56,770
...to be destitute...
we cannot allow it.

941
01:07:56,804 --> 01:08:01,475
We must find you...
some...

942
01:08:01,509 --> 01:08:04,444
...temporary and...

943
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:06,480
...temporal refuge.

944
01:08:14,956 --> 01:08:18,325
[Man]: Keep the fire
away from the straw!

945
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:20,527
- [Man]: It is!
- [Man]: Good!

946
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:29,936
- [Man]: Boy, keep the banners and colours
all together. - [Man]: Right, sir!

947
01:08:29,971 --> 01:08:34,674
Some of you voted for him,

948
01:08:34,709 --> 01:08:40,514
for which unfortunate choice
you are now forgiven. [Quiet chuckling]

949
01:08:40,548 --> 01:08:43,183
But most of you voted against.

950
01:08:43,217 --> 01:08:45,519
We have assembled the barest
of majorities.

951
01:08:45,553 --> 01:08:48,021
But then,
this Borgia pope was elected

952
01:08:48,056 --> 01:08:50,690
with just such a majority.

953
01:08:54,062 --> 01:08:58,198
The cardinal's demise was...
sudden.

954
01:08:58,232 --> 01:09:00,667
So it seems.

955
01:09:02,837 --> 01:09:07,107
But his palace is ideal as a...

956
01:09:07,141 --> 01:09:11,111
...place
of penitence...

957
01:09:11,145 --> 01:09:13,146
...and...

958
01:09:13,181 --> 01:09:15,182
...self-reflection.

959
01:09:28,529 --> 01:09:32,599
[Rovere]: If it can be proven,
what many of us suspect...

960
01:09:32,633 --> 01:09:35,535
corruption, simony,

961
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:39,106
the blatant sale
of the sacred offices,

962
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:43,643
and worse, the utter degradation
of the office of the papacy

963
01:09:43,678 --> 01:09:45,679
in the eyes
of the Christian world...

964
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:53,854
[Borgia]: You must think
of your sojourn here

965
01:09:53,888 --> 01:09:57,023
as a retreat.

966
01:09:57,058 --> 01:09:58,558
A retreat?

967
01:10:02,063 --> 01:10:05,232
The cardinal had this tunnel
built.

968
01:10:05,266 --> 01:10:09,236
It leads
inside the Vatican walls.

969
01:10:13,908 --> 01:10:17,844
If you ever find yourself
in need of...

970
01:10:17,879 --> 01:10:21,348
...spiritual comfort..

971
01:10:21,382 --> 01:10:24,885
...in your loneliness...
Your Holiness.

972
01:10:24,919 --> 01:10:29,322
You must not be afraid
to avail of it.

973
01:10:29,357 --> 01:10:31,558
Day or night.

974
01:10:36,697 --> 01:10:38,698
We shall leave you now.

975
01:10:41,035 --> 01:10:44,437
This passage goes both ways.

976
01:10:44,472 --> 01:10:48,175
Your Holiness must feel
free to visit...

977
01:10:48,209 --> 01:10:53,180
...if God's love were ever
to leave him wanting.

978
01:10:57,251 --> 01:11:02,355
The cardinal summons me in the dead
of night. Is there a reason?

979
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:05,859
These are turbulent times,
Father.

980
01:11:12,867 --> 01:11:14,868
Dottore...

981
01:11:18,105 --> 01:11:20,440
You can leave us now.

982
01:11:23,911 --> 01:11:28,915
I need advice, dottore,
on a delicate matter.

983
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:31,718
The deposition of a pope.

984
01:11:33,721 --> 01:11:36,356
Delicate indeed.

985
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:39,793
And, if I may say so, dangerous.

986
01:13:21,529 --> 01:13:24,064
Stop that.

987
01:13:26,067 --> 01:13:28,568
You have done penance enough.

988
01:13:34,208 --> 01:13:37,344
Who then will forgive us,
Your Holiness?

989
01:13:37,378 --> 01:13:39,379
God will.

990
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:24,758
[Muttering]

991
01:14:24,792 --> 01:14:27,927
Huggucio of Pisa states:

992
01:14:27,962 --> 01:14:32,866
"Ecce publico fornicator,
publico habet concubinem..."

993
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:36,436
The pope who publicly fornicates,
publicly keeps a concubine...

994
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:39,472
Can indeed be deposed,

995
01:14:39,507 --> 01:14:45,545
because to scandalize the Church
is in itself heresy.

996
01:14:45,579 --> 01:14:49,983
But one would need firm evidence

997
01:14:50,017 --> 01:14:53,019
of notorious and public lechery.

998
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:59,359
Whose bed is this?

999
01:14:59,393 --> 01:15:01,728
Yours, of course.

1000
01:15:04,165 --> 01:15:06,166
Whose bed was this?

1001
01:15:09,904 --> 01:15:13,006
It belonged to a cardinal
and a fool.

1002
01:15:15,009 --> 01:15:17,177
What kind of fool?

1003
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:22,248
The kind of fool
who doesn't understand that

1004
01:15:22,283 --> 01:15:25,084
God's work can be done

1005
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:27,487
even by the most unlikely
of his servants.

1006
01:15:27,521 --> 01:15:31,024
- And that Rome needs now is...
- You.

1007
01:15:33,527 --> 01:15:35,028
Power.

1008
01:15:40,468 --> 01:15:44,704
You're so beautiful,
Giulia Farnese.

1009
01:15:46,707 --> 01:15:49,709
I would have you painted.

1010
01:16:18,572 --> 01:16:21,841
- She is beautiful.
- She is.

1011
01:16:23,844 --> 01:16:26,112
More beautiful
than your painting.

1012
01:16:26,146 --> 01:16:31,050
- I've just begun.
- You must do better, then.

1013
01:16:31,085 --> 01:16:34,153
Her hair curls, here.

1014
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,458
Who is she?

1015
01:16:38,492 --> 01:16:41,361
Giulia Farnese.

1016
01:16:41,395 --> 01:16:43,763
At your service.

1017
01:16:43,797 --> 01:16:46,799
Why is he painting you,

1018
01:16:46,834 --> 01:16:48,801
Giulia Farnese?

1019
01:16:48,836 --> 01:16:52,138
Your father, the pope,
commissioned him.

1020
01:16:52,172 --> 01:16:53,940
Will he paint one of me?

1021
01:16:53,974 --> 01:16:56,075
I will commission him, now.

1022
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:59,045
[Goat bleating]

1023
01:16:59,079 --> 01:17:01,047
Why are you holding a baby goat?

1024
01:17:01,081 --> 01:17:04,317
It will become a unicorn.

1025
01:17:04,351 --> 01:17:06,352
Then I want a unicorn.

1026
01:17:10,124 --> 01:17:13,660
Or even better, a sea horse.

1027
01:17:18,766 --> 01:17:22,702
I want to lie on a bed of seashells
and have a sea horse in my lap.

1028
01:17:22,736 --> 01:17:24,604
[Giulia]: Like this one?

1029
01:17:29,109 --> 01:17:32,011
Yes.

1030
01:17:32,046 --> 01:17:34,447
Just like this one.

1031
01:17:34,481 --> 01:17:36,349
You must have it, then.

1032
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:38,618
I can?

1033
01:17:42,456 --> 01:17:45,091
It's a gift.

1034
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:49,028
From Giulia to Lucrezia.

1035
01:17:49,063 --> 01:17:53,232
- Can I kiss you, then?
- Only if we are to be friends.

1036
01:17:53,267 --> 01:17:56,269
We are friends already.

1037
01:18:00,975 --> 01:18:03,543
I am to have
my portrait painted, Mama.

1038
01:18:03,577 --> 01:18:06,879
- You are?
- But I don't want a goat,

1039
01:18:06,914 --> 01:18:12,051
or a unicorn. I told Giulia I
want a sea horse like this one.

1040
01:18:12,086 --> 01:18:15,088
- You told who?
- Giulia Farnese.

1041
01:18:17,091 --> 01:18:19,726
Giulia Farnese is having
her portrait painted?

1042
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,594
By Pinturicchio.

1043
01:18:21,629 --> 01:18:24,030
Papa commissioned him.

1044
01:18:27,935 --> 01:18:29,569
Ah.

1045
01:18:29,603 --> 01:18:33,439
She gave me this pendant.

1046
01:18:33,474 --> 01:18:37,410
I think a sea horse is better
than a unicorn, don't you Mama?

1047
01:18:37,444 --> 01:18:41,547
I've heard she is beautiful,
this Giulia Farnese.

1048
01:18:44,718 --> 01:18:48,388
- Papa thinks so.
- I am sure he does.

1049
01:18:52,493 --> 01:18:55,628
A different type of beauty
to yours, Mama.

1050
01:18:55,663 --> 01:19:00,233
Not Spanish.
Italian.

1051
01:19:00,267 --> 01:19:03,469
Her hair is light,
and full of curls.

1052
01:19:09,576 --> 01:19:12,245
And where did you meet her,
Lucrezia?

1053
01:19:14,248 --> 01:19:16,215
In Papa's rooms.

1054
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:18,251
In the Vatican.

1055
01:19:26,026 --> 01:19:29,729
- [Man]: Please, My Lady!
- [Man]: Your Holiness!

1056
01:19:29,763 --> 01:19:31,230
My dear.

1057
01:19:31,265 --> 01:19:34,400
You told me
that the pope can love God,

1058
01:19:34,435 --> 01:19:36,469
but to be seen
to love anyone else

1059
01:19:36,503 --> 01:19:38,371
- would be impossible.
- Your Holiness...

1060
01:19:38,405 --> 01:19:40,406
- Now, now...
- Shall we remove ourselves?

1061
01:19:40,441 --> 01:19:42,408
That the pope must be chaste,

1062
01:19:42,443 --> 01:19:45,411
and he must be seen to be chaste.

1063
01:19:45,446 --> 01:19:48,081
Don't you want them to hear?
That you have a new whore?!

1064
01:19:48,115 --> 01:19:50,349
- Mother!
- Farnese!

1065
01:19:50,384 --> 01:19:52,218
- Get out!
- That you've installed her

1066
01:19:52,252 --> 01:19:54,153
- in the Orsini Palace?
- What?

1067
01:19:54,188 --> 01:19:56,155
- We were...
- Be gone!

1068
01:19:56,190 --> 01:19:58,758
I banished my husband
for your sake!

1069
01:19:58,792 --> 01:20:02,261
You are the mother of my children! You will
always have a special place in my life.

1070
01:20:02,296 --> 01:20:05,264
- What about your promise?!
- There is no one...

1071
01:20:05,299 --> 01:20:07,600
...no one,
closer to me than you.

1072
01:20:07,634 --> 01:20:09,168
Why her?!

1073
01:20:09,203 --> 01:20:11,904
She was in need!
I had to help her.

1074
01:20:11,939 --> 01:20:14,874
You were destitute once!

1075
01:20:14,908 --> 01:20:17,276
[Cesare]: Be gone!
Out!

1076
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:19,245
[Man]: We were
in consultation...

1077
01:20:19,279 --> 01:20:21,781
[Man]: Your Grace,
are leaving.

1078
01:20:31,391 --> 01:20:33,392
Don't lie to me.

1079
01:20:33,427 --> 01:20:34,894
To me, you cannot lie.

1080
01:20:34,928 --> 01:20:36,562
Then don't challenge me.

1081
01:20:36,597 --> 01:20:39,098
And never, ever
within these sacred walls.

1082
01:20:41,101 --> 01:20:45,104
I've dreamed about this room
and what it might do to you.

1083
01:20:47,274 --> 01:20:49,776
We need
a new understanding, then.

1084
01:20:51,779 --> 01:20:54,413
Perhaps.

1085
01:20:54,448 --> 01:20:56,916
I'll keep my peace.

1086
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:59,285
But I won't be humiliated.

1087
01:21:02,122 --> 01:21:03,723
I would have peace.

1088
01:21:03,757 --> 01:21:07,193
You commissioned a portrait
of her.

1089
01:21:07,227 --> 01:21:09,662
I shall have a portrait too

1090
01:21:09,696 --> 01:21:11,531
by the same new genius you found.

1091
01:21:11,565 --> 01:21:14,667
Pinturicchio.

1092
01:21:14,701 --> 01:21:18,004
He is good, but he's...

1093
01:21:18,038 --> 01:21:20,506
...expensive.

1094
01:21:20,541 --> 01:21:24,177
All of Rome is yours
for the taking.

1095
01:21:24,211 --> 01:21:27,013
Make sure he does me justice.

1096
01:21:27,047 --> 01:21:30,049
I was beautiful once, no?

1097
01:21:32,052 --> 01:21:34,320
You still are.

1098
01:21:34,354 --> 01:21:37,723
We agreed, did we not,
that you would not lie?

1099
01:21:40,594 --> 01:21:45,031
He has placed his new whore
in Orsini's palace, no?

1100
01:21:45,065 --> 01:21:47,200
I believe so, Your Eminence.

1101
01:21:47,234 --> 01:21:50,336
Question the staff, then,
in secret,

1102
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:54,373
and in any way you see fit.

1103
01:21:54,408 --> 01:21:56,909
We need evidence of lechery,

1104
01:21:56,944 --> 01:21:59,946
fornication...

1105
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:04,483
publico habet concubinem.

1106
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:08,988
- Get these to the Deacon-
Cardinal for signatures.

1107
01:22:09,022 --> 01:22:10,523
Yes, Your Eminence.

1108
01:22:19,867 --> 01:22:22,335
He has met in secret
with those cardinals

1109
01:22:22,369 --> 01:22:25,171
that hate your father.

1110
01:22:25,205 --> 01:22:27,006
With Johannes Burchard,

1111
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,442
he is making a case
for your father's deposition.

1112
01:22:29,476 --> 01:22:31,110
On what grounds?

1113
01:22:33,513 --> 01:22:36,649
Notorious and public lechery...

1114
01:22:36,683 --> 01:22:39,719
Lechery?
My father?

1115
01:22:39,753 --> 01:22:41,888
God forbid.

1116
01:22:41,922 --> 01:22:43,422
Has he evidence?

1117
01:22:43,457 --> 01:22:46,792
He means to find it.

1118
01:22:50,063 --> 01:22:53,366
Then perhaps
we should find it first,

1119
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,835
and silence it before it speaks.

1120
01:22:58,171 --> 01:23:00,706
Your mother was somewhat
troubled yesterday.

1121
01:23:00,741 --> 01:23:05,511
She finds the change
in our life difficult.

1122
01:23:05,545 --> 01:23:07,513
So I noticed.

1123
01:23:07,547 --> 01:23:09,849
Do what you can
to keep her out of here.

1124
01:23:11,852 --> 01:23:14,320
It would help, maybe,
if you were more discreet

1125
01:23:14,354 --> 01:23:16,822
- in your affections.
- But I...

1126
01:23:16,857 --> 01:23:19,492
You are aware, Holy Father,
of the plots against you?

1127
01:23:19,526 --> 01:23:22,862
Oh, what would Rome be
without a good plot?

1128
01:23:24,865 --> 01:23:27,333
The College of Cardinals is
split down the middle.

1129
01:23:27,367 --> 01:23:31,704
What? Well, perhaps
we need some more cardinals.

1130
01:23:33,707 --> 01:23:36,175
Johannes Burchard has been
asked for an opinion...

1131
01:23:36,209 --> 01:23:38,544
[Chuckling]
Dear old Johannes.

1132
01:23:38,578 --> 01:23:42,214
- He does give excellent opinion.
- On your deposition, Father.

1133
01:23:44,217 --> 01:23:45,718
Indeed.

1134
01:23:45,752 --> 01:23:49,055
There are certain things
I could speak of...

1135
01:23:51,058 --> 01:23:54,026
...for a price.

1136
01:23:54,061 --> 01:23:57,363
Don't worry.
You'll get paid.

1137
01:23:57,397 --> 01:23:59,231
I would need to be.

1138
01:24:01,234 --> 01:24:04,303
I have seen things
within these walls

1139
01:24:04,338 --> 01:24:08,641
that would shock a brace
of courtesans.

1140
01:24:08,675 --> 01:24:11,677
Well, now, there's no need
to shock a courtesan, is there?

1141
01:24:11,712 --> 01:24:15,881
A brace of cardinals, perhaps.

1142
01:24:24,191 --> 01:24:26,158
[Door closing]

1143
01:24:26,193 --> 01:24:30,096
[Bell tolling outside]

1144
01:24:30,130 --> 01:24:34,467
You were asked
for a judgment, I believe,

1145
01:24:34,501 --> 01:24:39,705
- some nights ago?
- Your Holiness, as an expert

1146
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:43,542
on canon law, when asked for
a judgment, I must provide it.

1147
01:24:43,577 --> 01:24:45,945
Please sit.

1148
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:52,451
I would have your opinion, then,

1149
01:24:52,486 --> 01:24:56,756
dear Johannes, on the expansion

1150
01:24:56,790 --> 01:24:59,458
of the College of Cardinals.

1151
01:24:59,493 --> 01:25:03,796
It is the pope's prerogative
to appoint whom he wishes,

1152
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:06,065
- Your Holiness.
- To whatever number he wishes?

1153
01:25:06,099 --> 01:25:08,034
Ah, well,

1154
01:25:08,068 --> 01:25:10,569
how many cardinals did
His Holiness have in mind?

1155
01:25:10,604 --> 01:25:14,940
How many would be needed
to make it safe for our papacy?

1156
01:25:20,714 --> 01:25:22,982
- Oh, dear.
- Come, come, Johannes.

1157
01:25:23,016 --> 01:25:26,685
You must be aware of the plots
against us?

1158
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:29,121
You could even,
if viewed with an unkind eye,

1159
01:25:29,156 --> 01:25:31,791
be seen to be party to them.

1160
01:25:31,825 --> 01:25:34,693
When asked for an opinion,
Your Holiness, you know

1161
01:25:34,728 --> 01:25:36,695
that I must provide it.

1162
01:25:36,730 --> 01:25:41,033
Ah. So,
your opinion, then.

1163
01:25:41,068 --> 01:25:46,405
How many new cardinals
to preserve our papacy?

1164
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:49,241
Umm...

1165
01:25:52,846 --> 01:25:56,715
- A baker's dozen, I would say.
- Mm!

1166
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,751
Thirteen!

1167
01:26:00,754 --> 01:26:04,790
And we can appoint them
all at once?

1168
01:26:04,825 --> 01:26:07,660
Without the vote of conclave?

1169
01:26:07,694 --> 01:26:10,296
Such a great number would need
a precedent.

1170
01:26:10,330 --> 01:26:12,531
Oh.

1171
01:26:14,534 --> 01:26:17,670
Find one, then.

1172
01:26:17,704 --> 01:26:20,639
Your Holiness.

1173
01:26:20,674 --> 01:26:22,641
I have received advice

1174
01:26:22,676 --> 01:26:27,179
from our most supreme expert
in canon law,

1175
01:26:27,214 --> 01:26:30,349
that a pope's election may be
overturned

1176
01:26:30,383 --> 01:26:33,352
if we can provide evidence
of lechery,

1177
01:26:33,386 --> 01:26:36,422
both notorious and public.

1178
01:26:36,456 --> 01:26:39,058
That evidence
I present to you now.

1179
01:26:53,907 --> 01:26:55,774
Leave us, Micheletto.

1180
01:27:02,082 --> 01:27:05,484
[Doors closing]
And now, my dear,

1181
01:27:05,519 --> 01:27:07,987
tell us what you have witnessed.

1182
01:27:08,021 --> 01:27:12,658
There is a passage, connecting
the palace to the Vatican.

1183
01:27:12,692 --> 01:27:16,962
His Holiness makes use
of it... nightly.

1184
01:27:16,997 --> 01:27:19,298
And then?

1185
01:27:19,332 --> 01:27:24,637
He enters her bedroom
while she chastises herself.

1186
01:27:24,671 --> 01:27:29,008
And I blush to even describe
what happens next.

1187
01:27:29,042 --> 01:27:30,776
Spare us nothing.

1188
01:27:30,810 --> 01:27:34,280
I wanted seashells
and a sea horse.

1189
01:27:34,314 --> 01:27:36,282
But you have a sea horse,
my love.

1190
01:27:36,316 --> 01:27:38,651
No, I mean a real one.
Like your goat.

1191
01:27:38,685 --> 01:27:42,821
But real sea horses are tiny,
my love.

1192
01:27:42,856 --> 01:27:46,492
- Am I your love?
- I would dearly love you to be.

1193
01:27:46,526 --> 01:27:49,495
My mother hates you.

1194
01:27:49,529 --> 01:27:51,564
You will learn, my dear,

1195
01:27:51,598 --> 01:27:55,367
as women, we control
so little of our destiny.

1196
01:27:55,402 --> 01:27:58,003
- Men do.
- And?

1197
01:27:58,038 --> 01:28:02,441
The outcome is,
we hate each other.

1198
01:28:02,475 --> 01:28:05,611
- But we should not.
- Who should we hate, then?

1199
01:28:05,645 --> 01:28:09,481
- Men?
- No, my love.

1200
01:28:09,516 --> 01:28:13,118
It's in our nature to love them.

1201
01:28:13,153 --> 01:28:16,789
But we should protect ourselves
against them.

1202
01:28:16,823 --> 01:28:19,959
Against our feelings
towards them.

1203
01:28:19,993 --> 01:28:23,128
We will all of us,
one day, be replaced.

1204
01:28:23,163 --> 01:28:25,598
Are you giving me instruction?

1205
01:28:25,632 --> 01:28:29,201
- Would you like me to?
- I think I would.

1206
01:28:31,204 --> 01:28:35,174
- What weapons do I have with
which to protect myself? - Your beauty.

1207
01:28:35,208 --> 01:28:39,178
- Is that a weapon?
- It can be deadly,

1208
01:28:39,212 --> 01:28:41,146
when well used.

1209
01:28:41,181 --> 01:28:44,950
But beauty doesn't last forever.

1210
01:28:44,985 --> 01:28:47,987
Gone, like the snows
of last year.

1211
01:28:48,021 --> 01:28:51,023
- What else?
- When beauty fades?

1212
01:28:53,026 --> 01:28:54,493
Your wit.

1213
01:28:54,527 --> 01:28:56,662
Your intelligence.

1214
01:28:56,696 --> 01:29:00,466
- And I have those weapons?
- Oh, in abundance.

1215
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:05,771
You should cultivate them.
You will be married some day.

1216
01:29:05,805 --> 01:29:11,477
You may need them...
sooner than you think.

1217
01:29:11,511 --> 01:29:14,580
Is she pretty,
this piece of evidence?

1218
01:29:14,614 --> 01:29:17,383
She has her charms, My Lord.

1219
01:29:17,417 --> 01:29:20,486
Perhaps you could see
that she takes a vow of silence.

1220
01:29:22,822 --> 01:29:25,157
Would God forgive us, Micheletto?

1221
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:29,295
I know not the ways of God,
My Lord.

1222
01:29:29,329 --> 01:29:31,697
But you know the ways of silence.

1223
01:29:33,667 --> 01:29:37,603
[Borgia]: And we decree
bullfighting will be permitted

1224
01:29:37,637 --> 01:29:42,408
within the walls of Rome
on public festivals

1225
01:29:42,442 --> 01:29:45,244
and the last Thursday
of every month.

1226
01:29:45,278 --> 01:29:47,579
[Cardinals murmuring]

1227
01:29:47,614 --> 01:29:51,417
And, finally,

1228
01:29:51,451 --> 01:29:55,120
the main business to hand.

1229
01:29:55,155 --> 01:29:58,257
Cardinal Della Rovere needs
no staff today, understand?

1230
01:29:58,291 --> 01:30:01,360
For a day of meditation, he has
requested peace and silence.

1231
01:30:01,394 --> 01:30:03,362
You can tell the others.

1232
01:30:05,765 --> 01:30:07,566
Have you not heard?

1233
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:09,902
His Eminence needs no staff
today.

1234
01:30:09,936 --> 01:30:14,139
It is a day of meditation. - He has much
on his mind. - Too much, some might say.

1235
01:30:14,174 --> 01:30:18,277
Such is the burden of great office.
Until tomorrow, my friend.

1236
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,314
We wish to announce our decision

1237
01:30:22,349 --> 01:30:25,117
to expand the College
of Cardinals,

1238
01:30:25,151 --> 01:30:28,954
in view of the crippling
workload placed upon it

1239
01:30:28,988 --> 01:30:31,423
by our restructuring

1240
01:30:31,458 --> 01:30:34,626
of the affairs
of our Holy Mother Church.

1241
01:30:36,629 --> 01:30:40,599
Thirteen new servants of God...
[Cardinals gasping]

1242
01:30:40,633 --> 01:30:43,135
...will receive
the cardinal's biretta.

1243
01:30:43,169 --> 01:30:45,871
Thirteen?!
[Angry exclamations]

1244
01:30:45,905 --> 01:30:47,606
We have judged it wise

1245
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:52,378
to strengthen the College
of Cardinals, given the enemies

1246
01:30:52,412 --> 01:30:54,880
who have wormed their way
within the Church of Rome.

1247
01:30:54,914 --> 01:30:56,882
This is against all precedence.

1248
01:30:56,916 --> 01:31:00,319
His Holiness will fill
the College with his favourites.

1249
01:31:00,353 --> 01:31:04,623
- I accuse His Holiness...
- Ohhh! Of what are we now accused?

1250
01:31:04,657 --> 01:31:07,059
Of an offence against canon law.

1251
01:31:07,093 --> 01:31:10,396
Against the Law
of our Holy Mother Church.

1252
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:14,533
Canon law?
But we have taken advice

1253
01:31:14,567 --> 01:31:19,271
from the most eminent
of all of our canon lawyers.

1254
01:31:36,289 --> 01:31:38,090
Apple...

1255
01:31:38,124 --> 01:31:40,359
...or peach?

1256
01:31:40,393 --> 01:31:43,128
Peach, I think.

1257
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:48,967
I like peach.

1258
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:54,406
Eat it all.

1259
01:31:56,409 --> 01:32:00,946
The Council of Constance is
most clear on this matter.

1260
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:03,649
I refer you to Statute 42,
Paragraph 3...

1261
01:32:03,683 --> 01:32:05,551
In brief, I pray.

1262
01:32:07,554 --> 01:32:10,956
His Holiness, the pope, may
expand the College

1263
01:32:10,990 --> 01:32:13,258
to any number
he deems appropriate,

1264
01:32:13,293 --> 01:32:15,427
if the burden of work
necessitates...

1265
01:32:15,462 --> 01:32:17,095
I challenge him to name them now!

1266
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:19,364
Your Holiness.

1267
01:32:19,399 --> 01:32:21,400
Oh...

1268
01:32:21,434 --> 01:32:25,070
Dottore, if you would be so kind.

1269
01:32:25,104 --> 01:32:29,608
[Grunting]: And His Holiness
comes behind the Lady Giulia

1270
01:32:29,642 --> 01:32:33,345
- thus!
- With the force of a stallion.

1271
01:32:33,379 --> 01:32:35,080
[Gasping and grunting]

1272
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:38,617
The Bishop of Lucca,

1273
01:32:38,651 --> 01:32:42,287
His Grace Fiorentini, will be
named Cardinal Fiorentini.

1274
01:32:42,322 --> 01:32:46,758
The Bishop of Naples, His Grace Giovanni
Mascoli, will be named Cardinal Mascoli.

1275
01:32:46,793 --> 01:32:49,595
The Bishop of Valencia, His Grace

1276
01:32:49,629 --> 01:32:53,065
Cesare Borgia, will be named Cardinal Borgia.
[Sarcastic laughing]

1277
01:32:53,099 --> 01:32:57,469
The pope would make his son
a cardinal?

1278
01:32:57,504 --> 01:33:01,106
I warn you, I have evidence
that will bring this house

1279
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:04,343
- crashing down around your ears.
- Evidence?

1280
01:33:04,377 --> 01:33:10,148
Of lechery, transgressions,
both public and notorious!

1281
01:33:10,183 --> 01:33:12,284
Why, then, Cardinal,

1282
01:33:12,318 --> 01:33:14,019
you must present it.

1283
01:33:14,053 --> 01:33:16,188
I will!

1284
01:33:16,222 --> 01:33:17,623
[Spitting]

1285
01:33:28,201 --> 01:33:32,304
The... Bishop of Lyon...

1286
01:33:32,338 --> 01:33:34,339
[Gasping and grunting]

1287
01:33:37,410 --> 01:33:39,978
Though whether the Holy Father
is as virile as you...

1288
01:33:40,013 --> 01:33:41,747
Surely he is.

1289
01:33:41,781 --> 01:33:43,448
Only God can tell.

1290
01:33:49,122 --> 01:33:51,623
A candle, if you please!

1291
01:33:54,294 --> 01:33:56,728
Where is everyone?

1292
01:34:03,403 --> 01:34:05,404
Is there nobody about?

1293
01:34:09,342 --> 01:34:12,544
[Crickets chirping]

1294
01:34:12,579 --> 01:34:14,379
Dear Lord,

1295
01:34:14,414 --> 01:34:17,382
I pray for your strength
and guidance

1296
01:34:17,417 --> 01:34:20,218
in the trials to come.

1297
01:34:20,253 --> 01:34:22,688
Give us some sign

1298
01:34:22,722 --> 01:34:25,223
that Rome will be purified,

1299
01:34:25,258 --> 01:34:28,093
the Borgia stain will be
banished forever...

1300
01:34:39,439 --> 01:34:42,107
Guards! Guards!

1301
01:34:44,544 --> 01:34:46,511
Somebody!

1302
01:34:46,546 --> 01:34:48,680
Anybody!

1303
01:34:48,715 --> 01:34:50,215
Help!

1304
01:35:12,605 --> 01:35:15,574
Was the good cardinal known
for lechery?

1305
01:35:15,608 --> 01:35:18,110
He was discreet
in his affections, My Lord.

1306
01:35:18,144 --> 01:35:21,146
So discreet, indeed,

1307
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:25,884
he asked me to clear the house
of servants yesterday.

1308
01:35:25,918 --> 01:35:29,888
He must have had
lecherous intentions, then.

1309
01:35:29,922 --> 01:35:33,325
But I'm... shocked
that they ended in murder.

1310
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:35,327
And now he's fled, My Lord.

1311
01:35:35,361 --> 01:35:40,298
I would recommend discretion
in this matter.

1312
01:35:40,333 --> 01:35:43,035
The Church of Rome can
ill afford another scandal.

1313
01:35:46,272 --> 01:35:49,574
Perhaps he desired
her silence, My Lord.

1314
01:35:49,609 --> 01:35:54,112
He must have.
Poor girl...

1315
01:35:54,147 --> 01:35:56,982
Whom can one trust,
in this Rome of ours?

1316
01:35:57,016 --> 01:36:00,085
I believe trust needs
to be earned, My Lord.

1317
01:36:00,119 --> 01:36:02,220
Perhaps.

1318
01:36:04,223 --> 01:36:06,224
And perhaps it has been.

1319
