something they can root for.

Something aspirational, right?

731
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,959

know how to sell "okay."

inside a machine.

No, that's a man inside
a machine right there!

740
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,079
And his life depends on it.

741
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,519
And the future of
Omnicorp depends on it

742
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,439

do it, just go do it!

couldn't see my husband.
