00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,430
-( man) Ready?
-(W oman murmurs)

6
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:58,238
-( man) Yeah, let's try it like that.
-(papers rustle)

7
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:02,704
From the studios of WNYH
in New York City,

8
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:06,843
I'm GabrieI Noone,
and this is Noone at Night.

9
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,749
As a storyteIIer, I've spent years
Iooting my Iife for fiction.

10
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:18,491
Like a magpie, I tend to steaI
the shiny stuff and discard the rest.

11
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:22,695
The facts can alW ays be altered
When you're telling a story.

12
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,170
But this time.
I have to be careful.

13
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,868
I'll lay out the events
exactly as I remember them.

14
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,639
I W ant you to believe this. after all.

15
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,943
That'll be hard enough as it is.

16
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:41,282
This one is called ''The Night Listener. ''

17
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,852
It began in the W orst of all possible W eeks.

18
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:48,223
Jess had moved out.
saying it W as only temporary.

19
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:52,355
And I W as miserable.
Nothing made sense anymore.

20
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:57,233
I W as trying to read one of my ridiculous
yarns. the kind I had built a career on.

21
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,931
A sentimental piece
about our eighth anniversary.

22
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,498
But it felt so phony.
I couldn't put the W ords into our mouth.

23
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,374
This isn't working.

24
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,938
-(W oman) It wasn't that bad.
- It just doesn't sound Iike me.

25
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,541
(W oman) The IeveIs are the same.
I couId adjust.

26
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,814
No, no.
It-it just sounds fake.

27
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,879
Look, GabrieI.
We can't do this again.

28
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:18,981
(feedback)

29
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,821
Just run an oId one, OK?

30
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:25,023
I-I'm.. . You know, I can't.
I'm sorry, I just can't.

31
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,901
(bell tolling)

32
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:36,600
Hey.

33
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:40,635
- Why are you here?
- I thought I was gonna buy you a drink.

34
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,510
What happened in the session?

35
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:46,882
We're just having sound probIems.
Listen, I'm ready to coIIapse.

36
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,683
- You sure you don't wanna go?
- I'm sure.

37
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,881
None of my business,
but the station is worried.

38
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,019
You owe them five shows.

39
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:59,087
I reaIIy don't wanna taIk about that.

40
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,725
- I'm worried about you.
- I'm aII right. ReaIIy.

41
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,463
AII right. Look.

42
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,971
- Take this with you.
- Oh, no. Come on, Ashe.

43
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,440
- You don't have to write a bIurb.
- Thanks.

44
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,070
Just want you to read it.
We're pubIishing it next quarter.

45
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,240

Hope and Courage." Oh, pIease.

Save it, wiII ya? You'II have

48
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,953
- Hang in there, OK?
- Yeah.

49
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,117
See ya.

50
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,416
Jesus! You scared me.

51
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,952
- Just, uh, picking some stuff up.
- No probIem.

52
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,720
See you brought Lucifer.

53
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,923
Lucien.
He's just a friend.

54
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,065
Oh, babe, I toId ya.

55
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,764

56
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,870
- No, Hugo. Go.

58
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,627

59
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,873

Telling somebody to move out of the W ay.

73
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,291

Oh. W ell. Bye.

( dial tone)

85
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,848
- Ambushed?
- That's as good a word as any.

86
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:47,188
I thought it'd make you feeI better
to distract yourseIf.

87
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,058
The way I'm feeIing,
I might say something wrong.

88
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,962
You won't say anything wrong.
Did you Iike the book?

89
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,468
It's somewhat raw.
But powerfuI.

90
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,528
- He's a brave kid. How oId is he?
- 1 4.

91
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,539
Jesus.

92
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:02,972
How'd you get it?

93
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,943
(chuckles) Right over the transom.
No agent, no nothing.

94
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,980
- Donna just maiIed it to us.
- Who?

95
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:12,416
The sociaI worker who adopted him.
She got him to write as therapy.

96
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,214
You must have edited Iike crazy.

97
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,618
- WeII.. .
- What?

98
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,521
It's the cIeanest manuscript
I've had aII year.

99
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
Damn.

100
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:23,389
I wouIdn't do this to you unIess
I thought there was a reaI connection.

101
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,726
- Remember the basement?
- Yeah.

102
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,699
WeII, he Iistened
to the show after they'd gone.

103
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:32,260
- Jesus.
- He wanted me to give that to you.

104
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,649
(footsteps)

105
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,055
Jess?

106
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,662
What the heII are you doing?

107
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,798
Hi.

108
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,866
I can't do your books

109
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,412
This pIace was a mess.

110
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,608
Besides, I Iike Iaundry.
It makes me happy.

111
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:21,642
The power went out. Your fuse box
is fucked up. And your dad caIIed.

112
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:25,555
- You didn't pick up, did you?
- I had to. He kept saying:

113
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,618
( Southern accent) ''Pick up, goddammit.
I know you're there."

114
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,356
( normal voice) He's a nice oId coot.

115
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,093
If he met you, he'd caII you
''that cute Chink gaI'' behind your back.

116
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,294
- I am a cute Chink gaI.
- Mm-hm.

117
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,362
How oId is he anyway?
He's got to be, Iike, ancient.

118
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,839
Why? Because I am?

119
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:46,105
I just hope that I'm over my parents
by the time I'm your age.

120
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,373
Good Iuck.

121
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:52,645
They asked about Jess.
You haven't toId 'em yet, have you?

122
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:55,653
No. 'Cause he'II be back by then.

123
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,557
Right.

124
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,224

You don't sound like yourself.

134
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:34,358
Well. I'm a little less dramatic in person.

135
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,260

00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:03,515
- You and Jess. Do you have a tree?
- Oh, no.

145
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:07,184
We're not that big on Christmas.

Yeah. I knoW W hat you mean.

147
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:13,225
We got a rusty water tank across the street.
They hang a damn star on it every year.

148
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,392
A star.
That sounds nice.

149
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,492
Yeah.

150
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,596
Except it doesn't face this way.
Just Iights up the graffiti.

151
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:26,339
The rest of the town gets ''BethIehem."

165
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,791
- Hi. This is Donna Logand.
- Hey.

166
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:17,056
I'm sorry to cut this short.
This cough is worrying me.

167
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,496
- WeII, sure. I understand.. .
-( dial tone)

168
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,592
(turns off phone)

169
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,968
(phone rings)

170
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,776
HeIIo?

171
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,819
It's Donna.

172
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:45,346
He's asleep noW .
We had to drain his lungs.

173
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:48,689
- Has he toId you about the AIDS?
- Yeah. he did.

174
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:53,562
Listen, there are some incredibIe drugs
nowadays. They worked wonders for Jess.

175
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:57,762
Yeah, we've tried a Iot of them
but he had syphiIis when he was eight

176
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,465
and his Iungs are Iike Swiss cheese.

177
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,873
He doesn't have very long.
A feW months at the most.

178
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:09,472
It probabIy doesn't make it any easier,
being out here in the middIe of nowhere.

179
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,676
But I just can't have
those creeps knowing where he is.

180
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,412
I thought they were in prison.

181
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:18,217
His father W as. but his mother
disappeared after her arraignment.

182
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,124
- They don't know where she is.
- Surely after all these years...

183
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,389
We don't know what she's capabIe of.

184
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:29,290
But the point of moving here
is not to be paranoid. right?

185
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,394
( Gabriel) The thought of that
haunted me all night.

186
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:37,441
Over the next feW W eeks.
Pete and I talked almost every day.

187
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,205
Who do you W ant to talk to
When your book is published?

188
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,746
What do you mean?

189
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:45,375
You knoW . somebody famous
Who really likes your book.

190
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,180
Derek Jeter wouId be cooI.

191
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,245
WeII. OK. Yeah.

192
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,311
(Pete scoffs)

193
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,255
You don't knoW W ho that is. do you?

194
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,850
Of course.
He's a sports guy.

195
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,021
Yeah, what sport?

196
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,793
Gettin' picky on me.

197
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:04,563
Just 'cause you're a dick-smoker
don't mean you can't watch baII games.

198
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,036
What?

199
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:09,097
What. a dick-smoker?
You've never heard that?

200
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,766
No.

201
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,073
WeII, no offense or nothin'.

202
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:17,741
You and, uh.. . Jess seem pretty cooI.

203
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,215
So, how's he doing?

204
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,685
- He's OK.
- So W hen can I talk to him?

205
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:28,056
WeII, that's gonna be kind of difficuIt.
He moved out a coupIe of weeks ago.

206
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:31,756
Oh, man. That sucks.

207
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,529
He says he needs to be aIone,

208
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,535
but he says he's coming back.

209
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,436
I'm sure. It seemed Iike
you had something speciaI.

210
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,168
I think you've just gotta be patient. Gabriel.

211
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,710
Something like that
doesn't come every day.

212
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,645
That's what I want.

213
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,807
That kind of thing.

214
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,613
One of these days.

215
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,449
Don't W orry.
You'll get it.

216
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:59,389
No. Ain't a Iot of girIs
between here and the hospitaI.

217
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,483
You think about girIs a Iot?

218
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,122
That's all I can do. man.
Think about 'em.

219
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,156
Seeta.

220
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,633
You have Playboy?

221
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:24,039
-(Jess) Hey, you.
- Hey.

222
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,209
Hugo.

223
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,354
- For a friend.
- Yeah.

224
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:34,982
I was gonna caII you. I'm having a smaII
Christmas party. You wanna come?

225
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,824
- Sure.
- OK. I'II caII you.

226
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,296
- See ya.
- See ya.

227
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:47,732
So he gets the Playboy. Next thing
you know he's hiding it from his new mom.

228
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,070
Who knew I'd be
a heterosexuaI infIuence?

229
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:53,111
That is just the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

230
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,772
- Isn't it?
- I'd be carefuI if I was you.

231
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,180
- Why?
- FoIks couId taIk, that's aII.

232
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,480
About what?

233
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:04,852
Use your damn head.
That boy was abused by gays.

234
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,915
He was abused by pedophiIes.
Haven't you been Iistening?

235
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:10,086
- They were men.
- Straight men.

236
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,153
Lift you Ieg, sweetness.

237
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,893
How couId they be straight
if they messed with a boy?

238
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:19,427
- They caIIed him ''faggot'' whiIe doing it.
- Do you have to make everything fiIthy?

239
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,804
Honey, caIm down.
Don't get so angry.

240
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,309
That's much easier
than feeIing something.

241
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,675
What kind of New Age crap is that?

242
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,442
Just 'cause you're shut down
doesn't mean we have to be.

243
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:34,509
- Just because you're a big crybaby.. .
- Come on, guys.

244
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,044
- ShouId I go somewhere?
- No.

245
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:41,718
Come on, Iet's.. .
We're gonna be Iate.

246
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,592
- You two seemed a IittIe better this time.
- Yeah.

247
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:48,394
Another thousand years
we'II be abIe to have a conversation.

248
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,561
- What were you gonna teII us about Jess?
- Nothing.

249
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,333
Maybe we'II see him
on our way back to RaIeigh.

250
00:17:54,406 --> 00:18:00,174
Just say goodbye to the IittIe prick.
What? ''LittIe prick''? He can handIe that.

251
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,112
- I can handIe big ones, actuaIIy.
-(laughs)

252
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,343
You are nasty.

253
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,248
- What'd he say?
- See you, Pap.

254
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,310
OK, son.

255
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,390
(? hip-hop)

256
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,451
(chatter. laughter)

257
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,472
Hey, GabrieI!

258
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,017
GabrieI! Hey!

259
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,615
- Where are you going?
- Why'd you invite me to this?

260
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,850
It's a party.

261
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,516
RidicuIous.

262
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,584
GabrieI.

263
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,386
Come here.

264
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,993
What's the matter?

265
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,871
- Who are aII these peopIe?
- My friends. My roommate's and mine.

266
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:05,171
Since when did you know
so many peopIe?

267
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,838
Hey, most of my friends were your friends.

268
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:11,508
I wanted new friends.
What's the probIem here?

269
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,348
I don't understand what's happening.

270
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,455
When I moved in with you,
I was bareIy out of coIIege.

271
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,084
I wanted to take care of you.

272
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,823
And you don't think
I wanted to take care of you?

273
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,559
- I'm not saying that.
- That's what you think.

274
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:32,528
GabrieI, for eight years I was gonna die.

275
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:38,565
And now it Iooks Iike I'm not going to,
and I want to see what that feeIs Iike.

276
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,074
Look. I just.. .

277
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:45,048
If you had any guts,
you'd end this.

278
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,046
That's not how I feeI.

279
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,692
- No, no, no.
- Come here. Come here, pIease.

280
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,607
(knock on door)

281
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,406
Comin' out.

282
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,713
OK?

283
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,653
Yeah. I'm OK.

284
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:28,523
( Gabriel) You've reached Gabriel and
Jess. Please leave a message at the tone.

285
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,529
It's Donna.

286
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,588
I'm at the hospitaI.

287
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:40,066
He's in the oxygen tank.

288
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,539
It's not Iooking very good.

289
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,700
I don't think
he'll make it through the night.

290
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:50,339
I'll call you back W hen there's neW s. Bye.

291
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,542
(female machine voice)
End of message.

292
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,245
Ah.

293
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,413
Don't you think she'd have caIIed
if anything happened?

294
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,616
I've just got this gut feeIing.

295
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:03,388
- So caII the hospitaI.
- I don't know which one he's in.

296
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:08,060
Do you think it's possibIe
they're being a IittIe meIodramatic?

297
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:14,094
You know, the abusive parents,
the basement. It aII seems so over the top.

298
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:18,199
- Some peopIe have shitty Iives.
- They're not shitty aII the time.

299
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,507
(electronic hum)

300
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,570
They may be revving it up a bit.

301
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,138
(phone ringing)

302
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:30,246
I can't beIieve you'd even suggest
that a dying chiId wouId embeIIish it.

303
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,251
- HeIIo?
- It's Donna.

304
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,020
Hi.

305
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:38,221
Donna, I'm gonna put you
on speaker phone. Jess is here.

306
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:43,064
- Hi. Jess. It's nice to meet the real thing.
- It's nice to meet you, too.

307
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,593
Gabriel. the Bactrim's kicked in.
Pete's better this morning.

308
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,003
Thank God.

309
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,531

310
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,875
-(Pete) Hey. dude.

312
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,182
Hey, Jess is here.
He's fixing my fuse box.

313
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,948
I don't even W anna knoW
What that means.

314
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:06,548
OK. Well. they W ant me

315
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,617
- SIeep tight, dude.
-( dial tone)

316
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:14,323
What a reIief.

317
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,390
Yeah.

318
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,095
What?

319
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,609
I think it's the same voice, babe.

320
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,939
What?

321
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,242
Yeah. Pete and Donna. I.. .

322
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:32,707
I don't know,
they.. . they have the same voice.

323
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:35,548
One is higher-pitched, but they're.. .

324
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,418
Are you saying
it's some kind of impersonation?

325
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,390
Yeah, more or Iess.

326
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:43,690
- Why wouId someone do that?
- I don't know.

327
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,563
- Dozens of peopIe know them.
- Who?

328
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:52,194
Doctors. There's a nurse
who comes and stays at the house.

329
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,704
You've onIy been toId that.

330
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:58,038
- What about Ashe?
- Did he ever actuaIIy go to Wisconsin?

331
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,375
He must have.
What about the photo?

332
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,471
That couId be anybody.

333
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,016
- There's ways to prove this.
- Hey.

334
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:07,278
I'm happy to be wrong.

335
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:10,253
No. No, you're never
happy to be wrong.

336
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:14,588
This is the first time I've feIt decent
in weeks. Why are you trying to destroy it?

337
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:20,564
Because this isn't one of your stories.
You never Iook at things for what they are.

338
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:23,567
- That's such buIIshit.
- BuIIshit?

339
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,068
BuIIshit? OK.

340
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,503
Where exactIy did I teII you
I tested positive?

341
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,336
- What the.. .
- Answer the question!

342
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,606
In the park on a bench
in front of those guys pIaying drums.

343
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,236
No.

344
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,304
No, that's what you put in your show.

345
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:43,685
It was at a grimy oId deIi on 3rd.
But that's not very interesting, is it?

346
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:47,555
Look, I moved out
because I needed a break.

347
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:52,393
You aIways sift through this reIationship
Iooking for materiaI for your show.

348
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,591
TeII me you didn't fuckin' reIish it.

349
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:58,500
I went aIong with the show because
I thought it gave my death meaning.

350
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,197
But I don't need that anymore.

351
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:04,902
WeII, great. Because there's no show.
Are you happy?

352
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,944
That's not my fauIt.

353
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,776
You don't know him.

354
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,750
Maybe.

355
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:20,018
- Looks transparent to me.
- What's that supposed to mean?

356
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:25,028
You're aIways taIking about wanting kids.
And now you've created this.. .

357
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:30,363
- Fuck you. You're such an asshoIe!
- Fuck it. You know, go pIay with Tiny Tim.

358
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,266
( door closes)

359
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:36,736
Do you know anyone
who actuaIIy met Pete Logand?

360
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,742
No.

361
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,610
Not a doctor or a sociaI worker
or neighbor, anybody?

362
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,205
They Iive in Wisconsin.

363
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,944
Jess thinks Pete and Donna sound aIike.

364
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:50,351
- They do.
- That doesn't strike you as odd?

365
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:54,153
Pete didn't taIk when he came to Iive
with her and ended up imitating her.

366
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,421
- That wasn't in the book.
- A Iot isn't.

367
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,463
- You know 'cause she toId you.
- Yeah.

368
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,863
- You got aII of your information from her.
- Her and Pete.

369
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:04,128
Did she show you a birth certificate,

370
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:06,932
an adoption document,
something substantiaI?

371
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,235
If you think it's a hoax,
you're off base.

372
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,002
- Why?
- Because!

373
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,449
I spent over a year speaking with them and
they toId me things you couIdn't imagine.

374
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:25,388
Now, maybe your present situation
is coIoring the way you think.

375
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,152
It has nothing to do with that.

376
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:32,686
You're about to pubIish a book
by an author you know shit about.

377
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,255
ShouIdn't you be a IittIe concerned?

378
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,563
(phone ringing)

379
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:52,507
( Gabriel) You've reached Gabriel and
Jess. Please leave a message at the tone.

380
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:57,487
(Donna) Oh. uh... Well. I guess
you're not there so I'll just try again.

381
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,650
- HeIIo?
- Oh. it's Donna.

382
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:01,783
Hi.

383
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,263
I know this isn't much notice, but we'd
Iove for you to come visit for Christmas.

384
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,856
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah. sure.

385
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,097
The guest room ain't fancy.
but I cook a mean plum pudding

386
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,536
and it W ould mean so much to Pete.

387
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,665
- So...
-(coughing)

388
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,471
- Is that Pete?
- Yeah. he still has a cough.

389
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:23,537
But he's fine.
So. can you come?

390
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:26,209
I can't think of a better way
to spend Christmas.

391
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:30,220
- That's great.
- Yeah, it is. ReaIIy is.

392
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,789
- Hey, GabrieI.
- Hey, Marie.

393
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,727
- Didn't know you pIayed basebaII.
- Oh, no. It's a gift for a friend.

394
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,766
Signed by, uh, Jerry Deter.

395
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,028
You mean Derek Jeter?

396
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,697
- Yeah. Yeah.
-(phone rings)

397
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:54,943
Fuck, she baiIed on you.

398
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:58,312
- What was her excuse?
- There was no excuse.

399
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:03,252
Doctor said he shouIdn't have any visitors.
They're worried about him catching a fIu.

400
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:09,487
Fucking pIanes are petri dishes. I don't
want him to catch something from me.

401
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,652
So Iater, maybe.

402
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,996
Yeah. If he's stiII around.

403
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,729
WeII, you never know.

404
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,863
No, you don't.

405
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,101
Not about anything.

406
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:32,877
- We shouIdn't see each other anymore.
- Babe, it doesn't have to be Iike this.

407
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,112
Yeah, babe.

408
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:38,087
I don't want to be jerked around.
I want a cIean break.

409
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,853
- We're not gonna speak to each other?
- I'm too oId for this shit.

410
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:45,487
- Come on, GabrieI.
- Listen, you ruined what we had.

411
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:48,930
You're the fucking one
who can't see the reaIity.

412
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:55,703
What do you mean there won't be a book?
I thought your editor beIieved this kid.

413
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,470
He does, but his bosses got coId feet.

414
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:02,445
- And Donna and Pete?
- They're totaIIy devastated.

415
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,180
What do you have?

416
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:10,620
There is no record of any Pete Logand
in any kind of triaI.

417
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,021
Doesn't mean anything.

418
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,821
Pete took Donna's name
when she adopted him.

419
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:18,021
Ashe thinks
they were using an aIias

420
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:22,726
because that way his reaI mother
couIdn't track him down.

421
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:29,704
Cute kid.. . whoever he is.

422
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:34,077
Why wouId someone do this?
That's what I keep asking.

423
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,409
It's a hideous way
to promote a book.

424
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:40,781
Maybe it's not about that for her. Maybe
she doesn't even know she's doing it.

425
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,082
Like a muItipIe-personaIity thing?

426
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:46,885
Wait, what if she had a kid
who died in some, Iike, horribIe way

427
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,984
and now she needs to assume
his identity in order to.. .

428
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,050
No.

429
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,290
What if she has him embaImed?

430
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:56,424
- You know, Iike that guy from Psycho?
- Mm.

431
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:59,402
No, wait. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

432
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:03,237
What if she's the one who doesn't exist?
What if he's impersonating her?

433
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,902
PIease, now stop it.

434
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:09,970
This is not some sort of parIor game.

435
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,174
Sorry.

436
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:17,813
What if there is some haIf-dead kid and
I've just taken away his Iast shred of hope?

437
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,855
I couIdn't Iive with that.

438
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,861
Ever thought about a voiceprint?

439
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,297
Like what the cops use?
They're as good as fingerprints.

440
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,358
Now you're scaring me.

441
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,528
(beep)

442
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,767
(W oman) Hey. it's Davia.
There's a neW Thai place...

443
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,001
- No.
-(beep)

444
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,601
-(Pete) Hey. dick-smoker.
- That's him. Stop it.

445
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:41,736
(beep)

446
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:47,410
- OK. So what do you have from her?
- Nothing. I erased the Iast message.

447
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:50,147
Then you have to caII her.
Get her on tape.

448
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,689
- How do I do that?
- Uh.. .

449
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:57,820
You just, uh, press this button
right before you taIk to her.

450
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,696
I don't know, uh.. .

451
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:06,665
It's an answering machine,
not a thermonucIear device.

452
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:12,370
But what if I'm, you know,
recording her and the machine beeps?

453
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,342
(imitating chicken)

454
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,407
(beeping)

455
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:27,583
( ringing through receiver)

456
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,288
(operator) We're sorry. The number
you have reached is not in service.

457
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:36,766
Please check the number
or try your call again. This is a recording.

458
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,028
(W oman) So, do you have
famiIy in Wisconsin?

459
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:12,266
Yes, actuaIIy. A son.

460
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,998
Oh.

461
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:17,166
He Iives with his mother, though.

462
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:21,042
But I get to see him on hoIidays.

463
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:24,673
- How oId is he?
- 1 4.

464
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,743
You must have had him Iate.

465
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:35,020
- WeII, yeah, I.. . FairIy, yeah.
-(chuckles)

466
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,584
Do you have any pictures?

467
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,653
As a matter of fact.. .

468
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,873
Oh, my goodness.
Look at those eyes.

469
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,205
Yeah.

470
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,543
He has your nose and chin though.

471
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:01,181
- Does he?
- Hm.

472
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,879
Excuse me.

473
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:07,050
I hope this isn't too pushy,
but I saw your name on the passenger Iist

474
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:12,688
and I just wanted to say I reaIIy appreciate
everything you've done.. . for us.

475
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,755
The pIeasure was mine.

476
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:26,337
You've done something
for fIight attendants?

477
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:47,125
(beeping)

478
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,504
( ringing through receiver)

479
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:58,303
(operator) We're sorry. The number
you have reached is not in service...

480
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,673
Please check-

481
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:32,031
500.

482
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,974
507.

483
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,755
509.

484
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,819
51 1 .

485
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,088
Fuck.

486
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,879
Hi.

487
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:22,256
I've done something reaIIy dumb
and I was hoping you couId heIp me.

488
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,723
I have a good friend
who Iives here in Montgomery.

489
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,925
I've aIways assumed that 51 1 Henzke
was her actuaI address.

490
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,797
You meet her onIine?

491
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:34,264
No. Nothing Iike that. It's just.. .

492
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:38,866
She's a good friend and I'm sure she
comes in here aII the time. Donna Logand?

493
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:41,741
PeopIe pay us so they don't
have to use their reaI address.

494
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,338
It's the point of the pIace.

495
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,882
WeII, sure.

496
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,111
She's a friend.

497
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,781
I came a Iong way to.. .

498
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:56,084
OK. Fine.

499
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:18,239
(W ind W histles)

500
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,584
( metal creaking)

501
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,999
( door opens)

502
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,066
( dog barking)

503
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,002
( man) Hey!

504
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,760
- Are you OK?
- Thanks, yeah.

505
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,818
OK.

506
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:18,258
(person coughs)

507
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,736
(W oman) You Iike those burgers,
but they're awfuI on your tummy.

508
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,370
I'II fix you something when we get home.

509
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:31,677
Hey. You back for more cocoa?

510
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:36,049
- Does twice a day make me a junkie?
- Not by me. Anything for him?

511
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,248
Oh, no, thanks.
We shouIdn't make a habit of it.

512
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,382
- You mind if I have a cuddIe?
- Go ahead.

513
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:45,259
He needs aII the Iove he can get.
Don't you?

514
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,230
(W aitress chuckling)

515
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,282
OK, Iet's go.

516
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:14,354
See ya.

517
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:17,519
(W aitress)
You betcha. Stay warm.

518
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,086
(crossing bell dinging)

519
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,601
(train horn bloW s)

520
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,962
(train passes)

521
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,692
Aren't you gonna say heIIo, GabrieI?

522
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:32,258
(panting)

523
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,863
(W ater running)

524
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,754
(Donna) ChamomiIe OK?

525
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,095
Sure.

526
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:08,165
- Is this enough Iight?
- It's fine. Thanks.

527
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,617
It was Hank.
The cIerk at the grocery store?

528
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,215
- That's how I knew you were here.
- Oh.

529
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:31,955
- It's not some spooky bIind thing.
- Oh.

530
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:40,362
How Iong have you been bIind?

531
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:45,842
I remember a doIIhouse I used to have,
my father's face, things Iike that.

532
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,812
What about your mother?

533
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:55,580
She died when I was two. My father tried
to raise me. I guess Ashe didn't teII you.

534
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:58,178
- No.
- WeII.. .

535
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:02,749
It makes us more vuInerabIe. We've
aIready had to move once this year.

536
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:06,422
It's reaIIy wonderfuI
what you've done for Pete, though.

537
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,465
How did you find us, anyway?

538
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:14,994
The star. I.. .

539
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:19,937
I remember Pete mentioned
he couId see a star on a water tower.

540
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,468
And, uh, when I saw it, I just found.. .

541
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:25,572
AII the way to the house?

542
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,116
WeII, to this bIock.

543
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:30,950
And I saw you on the front porch and.. .

544
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,580
So.. .

545
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:38,153
Who foIIowed me from the coffee shop?

546
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:49,333
It's important I be abIe to trust you, GabrieI.

547
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:55,872
- Your phone Iine was down. I figured.. .
-(kettle W histling)

548
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,971
The tea.

549
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,679
Can I use your bathroom?

550
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:09,351
Sure. Top of the stairs.

551
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:29,235
- You found his room.
-(gasps)

552
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:46,179
Velveteen Rabbit.
I used to have one of those.

553
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,451
So, Pete.. .

554
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:53,053
He's at the hospitaI getting tests.
It's not Iooking good.

555
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,793
- I'm sorry. His Iungs?
- Yeah.

556
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,966
They're getting worse.

557
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,967
- Can I see him tomorrow?
- That'd be great.

558
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:11,510
- He means a Iot to you, doesn't he?
- Yeah, he does.

559
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:15,018
WeII, I know he feeIs
the same way about you.

560
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:18,578
As a matter of fact.. .

561
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:29,088
( Gabriel) The lights
of the highW ay are streaming past

562
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:33,125
and one of you reaches out
and holds the other one's leg.

563
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:36,104
It's the truest moment in the W orld.

564
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:41,641
- That's one of our favorite episodes.
-(both chuckle)

565
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,703
Thank you.

566
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,079
So Pete toId me about you and Jess.

567
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:51,019
You two seemed good together.

568
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:54,615
- Do you stiII Iove him?
- I don't know.

569
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,785
Does he feeI the same way?

570
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,956
I don't know what he thinks.

571
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,534
CouId I.. .

572
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:09,436
get a face to go with the voice?

573
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,732
Sure.

574
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:24,518
It's a hard pIace to be,
not knowing for sure.

575
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,817
Yeah, it's purgatory.

576
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:35,027
And you're just the kind of guy
who needs proof.

577
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:41,427
The heII of it is,
we're onIy as Ioved as we think we are.

578
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:50,574
I can't wait to see him.

579
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:52,342
Who, Jess?

580
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,407
No, Pete.

581
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,516
I'm sorry.

582
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,686
(clears throat)

583
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,492
Everyone does it.
He's just speciaI that way.

584
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,828
Yeah.

585
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:13,301
I need your heIp.

586
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,977
-(bang)
- Whoa.

587
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,919
- What?
- It's very dark.

588
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:36,653
I don't know where the Iight switch is.
Try by the door.

589
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,195
(clattering)

590
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:42,926
Somewhere in here
is my other sewing bag.

591
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,437
I've been spending so much time at the
hospitaI, I'm making Pete a new sweater.

592
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:50,564
Can you heIp me find the dark green one?

593
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:54,540
It'II go reaIIy weII with his eyes.

594
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,442
Here.

595
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:59,311
Thanks.

596
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:04,350
Hey, do you wanna see my sweater?

597
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:05,854
Sure.

598
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:10,257
I stiII need to put the buttons on,
but it's kind of fun.

599
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:14,562
- Turn around.
- Oh, OK.

600
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:21,935
I'm reaIIy trusting you here.
You better not be peeking.

601
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,996
(laughs) I won't.

602
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,012
OK.

603
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,520
Turn around.

604
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,361
How does it Iook?

605
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:53,767
WeII.. . It's.. .

606
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,973
It's nice.

607
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,305
You wanna feeI it?
It's nice and soft.

608
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,368
FeeI it.

609
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,472
Yeah, soft. Right.

610
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:07,283
It's nice.

611
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:10,684
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. It's nice.. .

612
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:13,985
- Is there something wrong with me?
- No, it's fine.. .

613
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,992
I know you Iike guys.
I was just trying to be friendIy.

614
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,893
You're such a fucking weirdo.

615
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:22,056
Turn around!

616
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:24,123
I'm sorry. I.. .

617
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,461
( dishes clatter)

618
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:37,736
(train passing)

619
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:41,375
So are you the reason
his book was canceIed?

620
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,820
That's what I thought.

621
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:50,291
That book meant everything to him.

622
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:54,091
That's why I'm here. I'II heIp him
find a new pubIisher. I'II do anything.. .

623
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,428
It's obvious why you came here.
You don't beIieve us.

624
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,797
I do.

625
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:00,928
- Let's just forget about tomorrow.
- No! I want to see him.

626
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:08,277
You know,
I thought you'd be different.

627
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:12,839
I thought you'd be abIe to Iook into his souI
with his compIexities and contradictions

628
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:15,749
and see him as your own
fIesh and bIood the way I do.

629
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:17,184
That is how I see him.

630
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:20,052
I don't think so.
You wouIdn't have distrusted us.

631
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:24,116
I spent two days stumbIing around
this fucked-up pIace so that I can say.. .

632
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:26,719
Just so you couId say what?

633
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:31,496
That you were sorry for thinking him
a fraud? Give me a fuckin' break.

634
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:36,495
Pete needs peopIe
who are reaIIy there for him.

635
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:41,541
And there's no way
I'm taking you to see him.

636
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,739
No way.

637
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,874
Your car is here.

638
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:20,476
- Where's the nearest hospitaI?
- Madison. But that's 50 miIes from here.

639
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,917
- That's fine. Let's go.
- OK.

640
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:25,978
(engine starts)

641
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:35,892
(W ind W histles)

642
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,565
(W ipers beating rhythimically)

643
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:03,516
L-o-g-a-n-d.

644
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:09,591
There's no Pete or Peter Logand
Iisted anywhere here.

645
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:12,567
Maybe he's Iisted under another name.

646
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:16,299
So what name shouId I be Iooking for?

647
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,068
I don't know.

648
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:22,577
Maybe you're at the wrong hospitaI.

649
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:27,174
I've been to aII the others.
He's gotta be here.

650
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,219
Can I just go up to Pediatrics
and Iook around?

651
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,585
What do you think?

652
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,383
Thanks for your time.

653
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,067
(bell rings)

654
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:47,297

( machine beeping)

657
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:20,896
God, no.

658
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,660
(W heezing)

659
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:28,135
I'm sorry.
I-I-I made a mistake.

660
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,730
I thought you were someone eIse.. .

661
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:33,037
Who are you?

662

He's at the hospitaI.
He's a very sick boy.

682
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:21,509
Have you ever actuaIIy seen Pete?

683
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:27,513
He spends most of his time
at the hospitaI.

684
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:30,354
Which hospitaI is he at?

685
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:34,161
Can I get you anything eIse?

686
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,958
So you won't heIp me.

687
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,566
You have a nice day.

689
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,707
( doorbell buzzes)

690
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,048
HeIIo.

(chatter over police radio)

694
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:56,914
I-I was just visiting a friend.

695
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:04,162
Maybe you know him. Pete?

696
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:07,202

697
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,034
I don't know what she toId you, but I.. .

-( zapping)
-(yelling)

704

( no audio)

708
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:28,974
GabrieI?

709
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:34,845
- I'm sorry. They're very protective of me.
- Stay away from me, Donna.

710
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:37,886
I came back to heIp you.

711
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:40,684
Why are you pissed at me?
You broke into our house.

712
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:44,318
I went to the fucking hospitaI.
He wasn't there!

713
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:48,557
- You went to the wrong hospitaI.
- I went to every damn hospitaI in Madison.

714
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:50,121
He was in MiIwaukee.

715
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,827
Of course. If I asked which one,
you'd say he moved.

716
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:54,699
- Just stop it.
- Or he suddenIy.. .

717
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,705
He's dead.

718
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:02,138
He died Iast night.
BiIateraI pneumonia.

719
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:06,648
His Iungs were saturated
and they couIdn't resuscitate him.

720
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:11,217
Jesus, you're good.

721
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:14,051
- What?
- You have a fuckin' answer for everything.

722
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,750
Oh.

723
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:17,690
It's the truth!

724
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,749
Yeah.

725
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:23,424
- If someone gets cIose, you kiII him off.
- You don't know what you're taIking about!

726
01:03:23,499 --> 01:03:28,732
They know everything! And they're caIIing
the hospitaIs. They don't Iike being Iied to.

727
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,864
(gasps)

728
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,807
I'm not Iying!

729
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:36,310
Jesus, why did I come here?

730
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:43,514
You know why? Because you thought
this wouId make a great fucking story.

731
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:47,784
You'II taIk about me and Peter on the radio.
That's what this has aIways been about.

732
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:53,022
AII you care about is your audience Ioving
you. What kind of sick person are you?

733
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:57,532
For years Jess was dying and you
picked over him Iike a vuIture. Stay.

734
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:01,366
You're so pathetic, you actuaIIy think
he's gonna come back to you.

735
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:03,997
Ohh..

736
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:05,597
Jesus. Get up.

737
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,803
Like you care,

-( vehicle approaching)

739
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:15,645
Come on,

743
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:30,589
Ah, oh!

- Get up! Get up!
- Ah!

745
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:38,504
Ah!

746
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:40,701

GabrieI, don't Ieave me!

752
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:59,494
You don't know what you're doing!

753
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,530
GabrieI!

754
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,930
Don't Ieave me!

755
01:05:31,861 --> 01:05:34,227

(phone ringing)

757
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:51,173
-( Anna) Gone?
-( Gabriel) She left.

758
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:54,009
( Anna) Who told you that?

759
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:56,449
( Gabriel) The police.

760
01:05:56,519 --> 01:06:01,786
They W ent to check on her

761
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:06,319
( Anna) Did they find
the kid at the hospitaI?

762
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:07,953
There never was a kid.

763
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,633
(phone ringing)

764
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:21,000
( Gabriel) You've reached Gabriel and
Jess. Please leave a message at the tone.

765
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:23,068

766
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:32,317
- And that's been going on for three days?
- Yeah.

767
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:37,982
- You have to caII the poIice.
- What am I gonna say?

768
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:42,520
''Excuse me, Officer, but there's
this crazy bIind Iady in Wisconsin

769
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:46,591
''who has an imaginary chiId
and she's upset with me."

770
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:50,399
No, fuck her.

771
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:52,907
I'm not turning my Iife inside out.

772
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:56,067
- She tried to kiII you.

773
01:06:56,145 --> 01:07:01,742
WeII, tried to kiII herseIf
and me aIong with her, yeah.

774
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:08,412
I did some research. There's this actuaI
pathoIogy caIIed ''factitious disorder."

775
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:13,588
The peopIe who have it feeI unworthy of
Iove so they make up stuff to get sympathy.

776
01:07:13,662 --> 01:07:18,725
Like, uh, their own iIIness
or - no thanks - a sick chiId.

777
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:24,433
It's, uh, it's Iike Munchausen's by proxy,
onIy there is no chiId.

778
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:28,940
- They don't know they're doing this?
- They know.

779
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:32,503
But the attention feeIs so good
they can't stop Iying.

780
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:36,449
What happens if you caII them on the Iie?

781
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,951
I don't know.
It didn't say.

(hangs up phone)

786
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:15,123
She caIIed two days ago.
She started shouting at me.

787
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:18,752
Just ranting and raving.
CompIeteIy out of it.

788
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:20,955
This woman is reIentIess.

789
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:23,863
She's desperate.
I mean, just so desperate.

790
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,094
She's bIind.
What is she gonna do?

791
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:28,329
(phone rings)

792
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,370
No fucking way.

793
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:35,500
( Gabriel) This is Gabriel and Jess...

794
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:38,012
- ShouId we pick up?
- No.

795
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,548
No, it might set her off,
trigger something.

796
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:43,312
- What shouId we do?
- Ignore it.

797
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:52,621

798
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:56,787
HeIIo?

799
01:08:56,866 --> 01:09:00,302
(Donna) Your story doesn't

800
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:03,270
I'm at the Hudson Plaza Motel at JFK.

(phone rings)

805
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:29,440
(Pete/Donna) Donna?

806
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,282
Who's this?

807
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:35,414
It's me. It's Pete.

808
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:42,120
Don't freak out. I knoW she told you I W as

809
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:44,256
Where are you?

810
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:48,360
I'm at the airport. W aiting for Donna.
Is she there?

811
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:51,167
No. She just Ieft.

01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:56,473
Too bad.
I really W anted you two to talk.

813
01:11:56,545 --> 01:12:00,072
I kind of promised her I W ouldn't

814
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:03,585
- Pete?
- Yeah?

815
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:06,587
I need to ask you something.

816
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,590
What?

817
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:12,354
Did something happen to Donna
when she was IittIe?

818
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:14,419
(Pete/Donna sighing)

819
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:20,395
- You understand, right?
- Yeah. but...

820
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:22,096
I don't knoW .

821
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,503
She never talks about her childhood.

822
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:29,707
Did she ever teII you
what caused her bIindness?

823
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:32,042
No.

824
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:34,810
I think she fell doW n the stairs.

825
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:37,181
You know,
there's peopIe who can heIp her.

826
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:39,311

827
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:42,053

( dial tone)

830
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:10,480
You know, that tape
doesn't prove anything.

831
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:16,616
That kid couId be anybody, right?
CouId be a neighbor, cousin.

832
01:13:16,692 --> 01:13:18,956
Yeah, I know.

833
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:21,655
So, what is it, then?

834
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,561
It's just.. .

835
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:25,623
What?

836
01:13:26,769 --> 01:13:30,398
How can I be missing someone
who never existed?

837
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:32,463
Is that possibIe?

838
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:38,606
Hey.

839
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:42,810
What about those Star Trek conventions?

840
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:50,755
You know, aII those guys, they dress up
Iike Kirk and Spock, right? Why?

841
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:53,522
Because they reaIIy miss them.

842
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:56,155
Am I that pathetic?

843
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:57,994
Hey.

844
01:13:58,066 --> 01:14:01,502
You have got a great big heart.

845
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:04,898
That's the best part about you.

846
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:06,964
It aIways was.

847
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:13,070
I gotta go.

848
01:14:39,908 --> 01:14:44,072
( Gabriel) From the studios
of WNYH in New York City,

849
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:48,515
I'm GabrieI Noone
and this is Noone at Night.

850
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:54,751
As a storyteIIer, I've spent years
Iooting my Iife for fiction.

851
01:14:54,823 --> 01:15:00,819
Like a magpie, I tend to steaI
the shiny stuff and discard the rest.

852
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:04,696
WeII, we've wandered
in the woods for an hour

853
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:09,794
onIy to discover
that we've circIed back on ourseIves.

854
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:15,003
And in the end,
I'm not sure what reaIIy happened.

855
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:19,912
But it is cIear that Donna and I
are more aIike than not.

856
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:21,916
Both of us afraid.

857
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:25,014
Not W anting to be alone.

858
01:15:25,087 --> 01:15:27,282
Longing for a good listener.

859
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,755
It sounds perfect.

860
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:33,523
And we aIso have a modeI condo avaiIabIe

861
01:15:33,595 --> 01:15:35,859
with aII the furniture incIuded.

862
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:37,364
That'd be great.

863
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:42,600
And, uh.. . when does your son
get out of the hospitaI?

864
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,335
Tomorrow.

865
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:49,468
That's tight.
But, no, we can work it out.

866
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:51,877
Thank you.

867
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:55,439
If you don't mind me asking.. .

868
01:15:55,517 --> 01:15:57,849
how did he Iose his Ieg?

869
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:09,194
( Gabriel) As for Pete. there's a line
in ''The Velveteen Rabbit'' that reads.:

870
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:12,631
''Real isn't hoW you're made.

871
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:15,192
''It's the thing that happens to you. ''

872
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:20,933
I'm Gabriel Noone.
Good night.
