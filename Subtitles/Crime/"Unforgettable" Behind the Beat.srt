Well, some colleges, the
kids, the overachievers,

00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,420
Yeah, I guess it'll help a musician,

114
00:03:47,522 --> 00:03:50,923
but is it worth killing someone over?

115
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:58,264
Why didn't you ever tell
me you were a jazz player?

00:03:58,366 --> 00:03:59,982
Oh, this coming from the
person who never told me

- Oh, well, it's different.
- Why?

119
00:04:03,004 --> 00:04:04,604
Because it's me, and besides,

120
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:07,273
playing the trumpet, it's
not exactly a chick magnet.

121
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,909
I know, you always went
for the lead guitar player.

00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:12,512
Actually, the drummer.
