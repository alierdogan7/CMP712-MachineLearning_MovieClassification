1
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,200
Please God, help me.

2
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,365
Please God, help me.

3
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,814
(muffled) Oh, you're already
back, John?

4
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,775
Oh-oh. What did our
boys break this time?

5
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,361
(Man) John!

6
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,656
(phone rings)

7
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,053
Let's go in my office.

8
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,850
John, the reason I called you here".
take a seat will you?

9
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:13,152
Reverend Beaumont dropped by
a little while ago.

10
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,414
He said your daughter is living
in his church. Since when?

11
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,955
Since Tuesday.

12
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,415
This is very awkward.

13
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,797
He gave me this.

14
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,883
She signed it.

15
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,319
-(officer) ls there a problem, Boss?
- Shh,

16
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,979
(phone rings)

17
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,919
This is Detective Bruce Kenner.
It is October

18
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,930
the 14th, 1990.
State your full name.

19
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,511
- John Gray.
- And your occupation.

20
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,096
Auto mechanic.

21
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,729
Okay, well you already know me,
I already know you so...

22
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:26,859
...why don't we not play any games and you
can start by telling me why you're here.

23
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:30,863
Well I'm... I'm really confused
and I've been thinking about...

24
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,867
I've been thinking about this
all night. And I've been praying.

25
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,494
- Does that help? Praying?
- Yeah. Yeah,

26
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:41,369
But I don't know, you see.

27
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,251
Part of me says it's impossible.

28
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,622
I... I don't remember anything.

29
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,083
It's just impossible.

30
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,428
All right, well then
what is the other part say?

31
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,554
Some things are obvious.

32
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,476
Such as?

33
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,397
First of all I'm completely sure
about one thing.

34
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,691
Angela never lies.

35
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,825
She'd never do that.
Her mother was just like her, a saint.

36
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,112
And I don't know, Little details
like not hugging or kissing me.

37
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,952
So she's...
she's been avoiding you?

38
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,661
Yeah.

39
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,703
And then... also the”.

40
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,416
John.

41
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,336
Cut the shit,
take your hat off first of all.

42
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,297
- What?
- Take your hat off.

43
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,055
Why do you think she
was avoiding you, John?

44
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,809
Cause I did it.

45
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,313
I did it.

46
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:01,077
He admits it, but he doesn't remember
doing it? I don't get it.

47
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:04,911
He's just stalling for time. I need to talk
to the girl as soon as possible.

48
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,292
Reverend says she
doesn't want to see anybody.

49
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,545
Well I don't care about the Reverend,
right. We need a psychologist,

50
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,957
- A psychologist?
- We need a good one.

51
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,047
Lean on him until he breaks, Do your thing.

52
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,882
It's child abuse, Chief.

53
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,718
(Cries)

54
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,223
Mrs. Gray.

55
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,736
I'll make you some tea, okay?

56
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,902
Mrs. Gray.

57
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,738
Did you know?

58
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,164
The Reverend called me and told me.

59
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,954
But I...

60
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,005
I talked to my son, and”.

61
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,750
He flew into a rage. He denied everything.

62
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,887
Reverend, please...
I need to see her.

63
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,799
We've already discussed that, Rose.

64
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,681
She'd rather stay at the church.

65
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,848
Mrs. Gray. You think it would all right if
I went, took a look at Angela's room?

66
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,608
-It's upstairs.
- Thank you'

67
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,985
It's the last door.

68
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,993
- What?
-It's the last door.

69
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,411
(cat meows)

70
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,911
(slow piano music)

71
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,567
(door is blown by the wind)

72
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,000
Hey Bruce.

73
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,752
This isn't right, we
need a warrant.

74
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,668
She gave us permission. Are you asleep?
Where's the son?

75
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,838
Roy? He left two years ago.

76
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,262
Where'd he go?

77
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,308
You don't know?

78
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:02,311
You're friends with the family and
you don't know where he went?

79
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,152
They've suffered a lot,
I wouldn't bring that up.

80
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,942
Mrs. Gray.

81
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,821
Have you heard from your grandson?

82
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:18,790
Not really. He calls sometimes
to say he's okay.

83
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,874
But...

84
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:25,008
Why did he leave? You think
he was running from his father?

85
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,762
I asked my son last night.

86
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,467
And what did he say?

87
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,382
He took my hand“.

88
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,138
And...

89
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,891
we prayed.

90
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,365
<i>(radio) It's not an urban legend.
The Satanists are living among us.</i>

91
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,367
<i>Like any religious group,
they worship their lord,</i>

92
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:55,952
<i>he Devil, and perform horrible rituals.
The question we should ask ourselves...</i>

93
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,833
How can you listen to this right now.
Can I tum it off?

94
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,211
No, turn it off.
It's your car.

95
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:09,170
John... I knew he had problems
but molesting his daughter?

96
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,380
- I can't believe it.
- Why not?

97
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,175
Because you both go to the same church?

98
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,980
What if? I mean what if...
...it was a caress'

99
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,766
A show of affection?

100
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,529
His daughter exaggerated it.
She's kind of difficult.

101
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,860
Really?
That's not what I hear.

102
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,984
- Said she's a little shy,
- I saw her grow up, Bruce.

103
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,448
You've seen that house,
you've seen the way that they live.

104
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,616
On top of that,
she lost her mom.

105
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,044
She's had a pretty shitty life.

106
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,208
Maybe she just”.

107
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,296
Wanted to get away from it all.
I don't know.

108
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,555
Well still, I mean you really think
a seventeen year old girl is going to...

109
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:58,264
...put her dad in prison just because
she wants to change her life?

110
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,561
We can't rule that out.

111
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,514
Right?

112
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,359
Yeah right, can't rule it out.

113
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,781
The boy calls his grandmother from a bar.

114
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,242
Trace one of those calls damn it.

115
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,199
Don't call me again until you find him.

116
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,543
Well?

117
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,126
Well umm..

118
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:32,173
- His mental state appears to be normal.
- I already told you that.

119
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,804
Big question is, why the sudden amnesia?

120
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,092
No one's going to believe him.
Bruce. Mr. Raines is here.

121
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,352
Don't think he's after anything.

122
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,511
What?

123
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,806
If he doesn't want a lawyer, then he isn't

124
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,600
drying to protect himself, right?
- I don't understand.

125
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,734
- Bruce!
- Yeah, I'm right here.

126
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:52,443
Say that again, professor, will ya.
I'm a bit of a dummy sometimes.

127
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,358
I don't think what John is doing
is a strategy,

128
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,654
on the contrary I think
he's trying to cooperate.

129
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,541
He keeps saying: I think I did it'
But speaks like he wasn't there.

130
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,952
And to a certain
extent, he wasn't.

131
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:10,256
See this is a man who has spent years
trying to stop drinking.

132
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:13,885
And he does ii by giving in to faith
which is an explosive combination.

133
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:18,389
Because on the one hand,
he goes too far, does awful things.

134
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,933
On the other hand he can't live
with the awful things he's done. So now...

135
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,518
...he can't find them in his head.

136
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,445
- He can't find them?
- He's repressed them.

137
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,571
The memories are behind some doors.

138
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:39,328
It's not that difficult to find a key
and free them. Provoke a regression.

139
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:43,240
Look, I'm not an expert.
But, I don't know.

140
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:47,036
- This all seems a little...
- It seems a little strange, doesn't it?

141
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:52,708
I suppose umm... I often tell my students
that the mind is a whole universe.

142
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,802
I read an article about this.

143
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,010
Regressive hypnosis has made
great progress, gentlemen,

144
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,804
Anyway, I hope you didn't...

145
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:07,351
...interrupt my classes,
to discuss these topics with me.

146
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,104
Or did you?

147
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,570
(clicking)

148
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,279
I've been very confused ever since.

149
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,991
My father ordered me
not to tell anyone.

150
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,249
He said, be a good girl and the Lord
will watch over you.

151
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,127
But I know this is wrong.

152
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:33,749
He touches me and forces me
to have sex with him'

153
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:38,094
I'm scared,
I don't know if I should.

154
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,426
Okay. John, again.
Concentrate

155
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:46,140
on the first sentence. Last year
my father started coming into my room.

156
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,393
Last year...

157
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:55,729
Remember what I said, John,
let the pendulum clear your mind.

158
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,651
Look through it.

159
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,615
This is no use.

160
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,906
How long are we going to keep doing this?

161
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,746
Just one more time.
Let yourself go.

162
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:13,755
I want you to relax every muscle
in your body'

163
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,673
Third sentence.

164
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:22,006
My father ordered me not to tell anyone.
He said, be a good girl

165
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,173
and the Lord will
watch over you.

166
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,640
...and the Lord will watch over you.
Yes, I said that,

167
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,770
I said that to her plenty of times.
But...

168
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,603
He touches me and forces me
to have sex with him'

169
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,607
Your daughter wrote this, Right?
You realize that?

170
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,614
It's her handwriting, John.

171
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,993
You yourself said, your
daughter never lies,

172
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,780
No, she would never lie.
She would never lie to me.

173
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,415
Well she must be, and
if you don't remember it...

174
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,418
Oh God! God please...

175
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,543
- Oh God help me I”.
-(Raines) John.

176
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,795
(Raines) John.

177
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,838
(Raines) Behind the pendulum...

178
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,596
Right behind...

179
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,942
Oh wait, wait-wait-wait.

180
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,323
I think I see something.

181
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,284
Okay, John, Tell us what you see.

182
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,701
I see <i>. .</i> . . ..is it my house?
And I'm moving.

183
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,919
Jesus. Jesus it's just like I was there.

184
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,881
(Raines) Just read it again, please.

185
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:43,803
(Bruce) Last year, my father
started coming into my room.

186
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,886
I've been very confused ever since.

187
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:52,346
He touches me and
forces me to have sex with him.

188
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,231
I see her.
She's sitting there on the bed.

189
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,642
(John moans)

190
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,899
I'm on top of her, Jesus!

191
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,107
- God no!
-(Bruce) What are you doing to her?

192
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,619
I tied her hands to the
headboard.

193
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,529
You're tying her'?
Can you see the rope?

194
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,369
Yeah.“ Yeah it's a rope.
It's a black rope.

195
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,417
Why is it black? Is it some type of ritual?

196
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,460
Hold on' Hold on. Now he's".
I'm tying her feet!

197
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,130
Wait, wait. You said "he".
Where are you watching this from?

198
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,637
I'm right there,
I'm standing right (here by the bed.

199
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,761
- Are you seeing yourself?
- I guess. It has to be me, right?

200
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,396
No, that's somebody else.
Focus on the face.

201
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,149
Why! Then why aren't I stopping it?

202
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,309
What the hell am I doing there!

203
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,945
Somebody you let in,
somebody you must know.

204
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,277
Why aren't I stopping
it! Jesus!

205
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,192
- Angela!
- A face, John' It's someone you know.

206
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,488
I don't know who it is!
It could be anybody!

207
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,998
Who has been in your
house in the last year?

208
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,329
- You know who it is, John...
- Detective...

209
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,750
I guess... I'm holding a camera...

210
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,762
I'm taking pictures!

211
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,390
Hold on just a second”.
I see... I think I see.

212
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,224
It's George!

213
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,014
George Nesbitt?

214
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,478
- Okay...
- George Nesbitt?

215
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,656
(car horn)
Hey George!

216
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,744
Hey George.

217
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:36,449
Hey Bruce. How'd it go with John?

218
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,084
Where you doing?

219
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,165
Where do you think?
My shift is over.

220
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,085
Is there a problem?

221
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,888
Your name came up.

222
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,686
My name?

223
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,356
What'd he say?

224
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:10,700
You tell me, huh George.
You tell me.

225
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,290
What if I told you I just looked at all the
photos. Would you tell me you did it then?

226
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,543
- We have the photos.
- If you showed me.

227
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,631
(whispers) Oh I get it...

228
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,848
Wail a minute, no. I'm not sure".
This is all really weird.

229
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:38,011
Five minutes ago I would have
never believed it. Now I wanna kill you.

230
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,896
- Give me your gun,
- Bruce, take it easy okay.

231
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,149
I am taking it easy.
Give me your gun'

232
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,854
What photos“.

233
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,565
Now you don't know what
I'm talking about huh'?

234
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,230
- Fuck!
- Son of a bitch!

235
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,995
Oh please, Give me a break,
you assaulted him without saying a word.

236
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:04,162
I would never do that Katie,
and you know that, You know he's lying.

237
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,127
That's enough.
Nesbitt is my client now.

238
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,630
And that whole (hing
about the photos,

239
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:14,514
if you had them, you'd already
have shown them to me, don't you think?

240
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,717
So who's the one lying here, Bruce?

241
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,601
Without saying a word...
Do you hear this bull shit, Chief?

242
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:26,142
We need to talk to the girl,
If she identifies him.

243
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,357
Just hold your horses.

244
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:31,439
Sometimes I wish I was like you, Bruce.

245
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,152
For me this is all”.

246
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,743
Nesbitt was one of our own.

247
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:41,370
Just remember that, okay.
Take your psychologist.

248
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,079
Thanks Chief.

249
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,250
We're leaving.

250
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,939
You suspected Nesbitt
before John said his name, why?

251
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:17,326
There was something off about him.
lam a Detective, Professor'

252
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,954
I see' Nevertheless,

253
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,621
But please do not interfere
with my therapy again.

254
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,254
You and your people can ask him
anything you like. But after that”.

255
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,005
...it's my turn.

256
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,158
Oh hey, Hello Angela.

257
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:06,076
My name's Bruce. Bruce Kenner.
Please, have a seat.

258
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,587
We actually met before once
in your father's workshop'

259
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,004
You wouldn't remember,
you were.” smaller.

260
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:25,224
We just want to have a little chat. This is
Professor Raines. He's our psychologist.

261
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,599
(whispers) Angela, do you want me to stay?

262
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,567
We're just going to ask
you a few questions.

263
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,280
I'm not crazy.

264
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,904
No, of course not.

265
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:51,045
The reason I'm asking
so many questions is because...

266
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,833
We know there was
someone else in the room.

267
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,340
Your father told us.

268
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,049
But why?

269
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,099
Why did he say that?

270
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:07,137
I need you to look at
these photos closely.

271
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,930
I don't want to go on
with this,

272
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,394
Angela. These people hurt you.

273
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,150
And they could hurt
someone else.

274
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:18,281
Your father said something about a ritual?
What's all that about?

275
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,075
Would you like to write it down?
Sometimes that helps.

276
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,548
Alone.
I want to do it alone.

277
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,800
Okay'-

278
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,471
She was always sad.

279
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,891
Like she was shutting herself in.

280
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,062
It was in one of our seminars.

281
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,482
(woman) ...stay away from me
Satan, I have Jesus.

282
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,610
She just started crying all of a sudden.

283
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,863
Then I realized”.

284
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,829
It was like, like God
had spoken to me'

285
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,873
I'd prefer to call that intuition,
Reverend,

286
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:17,961
Call it whatever you want.
But I knew it was her father.

287
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,844
And that it had happened
more than once.

288
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,418
Angela?

289
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,545
These things they did to you?

290
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,260
When they summoned the Devil.

291
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,268
Who else was there with your father?

292
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,104
Could you please tell me?
His name?

293
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,044
You did great.

294
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,507
(Cries)

295
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,928
(indistinctive chatter)

296
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:57,223
I'm afraid I don't know
anything about Satanism.

297
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,934
Are you a man of faith?

298
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,274
I'm afraid I'm in no mood
to answer that question.

299
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:06,691
Agnostic. You want to believe,
but you can't.

300
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,202
Don't worry.
I went through that phase myself.

301
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,173
I got a hold of a copy.

302
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,103
You branded her with an inverted cross.

303
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,901
Now I'm starting to understand
why you came to us.

304
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,536
It wasn't to get over
your wife's death.

305
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:58,584
It was to desecrate our church.

306
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,412
Well Reverend,

307
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,168
I...

308
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,918
You don't know what I'm talking about.

309
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:12,552
You don't remember
the insults, or the torture?

310
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,716
Or the excrement or”.

311
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:22,399
Okay John".
Just do us all a favour.

312
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,398
Try.

313
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:44,126
<i>...as pan of a ritual
involving black magic.</i>

314
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:49,044
<i>One of his accomplices could even belong
to the Hoyer Police Department.</i>

315
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,587
<i>And tonight,
don't miss our special segment...</i>

316
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,427
Wonderful. That's what
I call not causing a panic.

317
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,639
<i>...keep the people of
this city in suspense.</i>

318
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,528
(phone rings)

319
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,372
(phone rings)

320
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,837
<i>- Hello?
- It's Cleveland, turn on the TV.</i>

321
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:28,124
Yeah, all right.
What channel?

322
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,303
Yeah. Give me a second.

323
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,894
<i>We used to consider Satanic ritual abuse
something from the middle ages,</i>

324
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,650
<i>or literary fantasy.</i>

325
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:52,361
<i>Bu! in the flask few years.
books like this one have opened our eyes.</i>

326
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:57,866
<i>woman) They branded his sign
on my back, said that I was his sieve.</i>

327
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:02,332
<i>They made me attend
their ceremonies for 15 years.</i>

328
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,744
<i>One time I even saw
them sacrifice...</i>

329
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,503
Yeah right I'll see you tomorrow.

330
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:11,133
<i>Maybe it's easier to think people
aren't capable of doing things like this.</i>

331
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,798
<i>R's very sad.</i>

332
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:37,322
(sleep talking)

333
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,367
(yells) No! No! I don't want to!

334
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:03,477
Okay, Angela <i>says</i> that
Nesbitt branded this._.

335
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,475
...on her stomach with a knife.

336
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,359
John just corroborated it.
That's not all.

337
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,110
Now he remembers something about
a black cat and someone wearing a hood.

338
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,533
You can imagine what
I'm talking about.

339
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,783
Satanic Ritual Abuse.

340
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,790
How long will you detain
George without any proof?

341
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:29,203
He's a cop, we can detain him
as long as necessary.

342
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:33,749
Tom. Find this book.
Get everybody a copy.

343
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:37,386
- Everybody?
- S. Cooper, she was on TV last night.

344
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,093
- Can I make photocopies?
- Just a copy Tom.

345
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,054
We're poor... I had to say it.

346
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:48,268
Boss, I actually read that book'
But it seemed like a pile of trash to me.

347
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,775
Baby sacrifices and snuff movies? Come on.

348
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,901
The FBI would be
all over something like that.

349
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,779
Really? What do you
know about it?

350
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,905
Have you even
bothered to call the FBI?

351
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:00,609
No, but”.

352
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,871
This case is a little bit more complicated

353
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,703
than taking a stroll
and handing out parking tickets.

354
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:10,453
We have to be on-point.
No mistakes.

355
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,621
Even if it's just this one time.

356
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,836
What's that mean,
just (his one time.

357
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,421
Okay, okay. Enough! Enough!

358
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,254
Go on, get the job done.

359
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:31,060
I thought this was a quiet town.

360
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:34,272
Keep thinking of my granddaughters, Jesus.

361
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:39,861
You don't look too good.
You sleepin'?

362
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,660
I just get the feeling
with this case...

363
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,663
- What?
- I don't know.

364
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,867
That look in your eyes scares me.

365
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:55,540
It's a part of something bigger.
You know much bigger,

366
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,295
Charlie, how many times
did I say, knock first.

367
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,884
- Sorry Chief. Ahh, we found him.
- Who?

368
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:07,142
John's son. Roy.
He lives in Pittsburgh.

369
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,769
Okay. Where the hell is Tom?

370
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:14,729
(Cleveland) Ask him, if our department
can afford two plane tickets to Pittsburgh.

371
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:34,002
<i>-(Bruce) Your father told us.
(Angela) Why? Why did he say that?</i>

372
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:37,005
<i>(Bruce) I need you to look at
these photos closely.</i>

373
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:40,839
<i>-(Angela) I don't want to go on with this.
-(Bruce) Angela, these people hurt you'</i>

374
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:44,881
Do you make your wife listen to this
over and over again?

375
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:52,138
- We're separated.
- Well now you know why.

376
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:15,290
(indistinct chatter)

377
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,963
Hey ROY-

378
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,883
-(Roy) A ritual?
- Yeah.

379
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,057
-It's a great story'
-(Bruce) Does it surprise you?

380
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,435
My father warships the devil?

381
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:35,397
What would you think?
Good girl.

382
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:39,856
Is that why you ran away?
To get away from him?

383
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,613
- Why don't you ask him.
- I did. That's why I'm here.

384
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,742
What about your mother?
Was she good to you?

385
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,034
Yeah. When she left us.

386
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,246
She killed herself.“ Did you know that?

387
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:59,504
I just know what it said in the report -
a car accident. A lapse at the wheel.

388
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:02,416
My Dad made her life hell for 20 years.

389
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:07,175
He's a drunk, you know,
it's probably not in the report.

390
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:12,184
He got us all involved in that Evangelical
stuff, like that would make things better.

391
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:16,643
Why don't you tell us about that.
What was he like when he drank?

392
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,643
- I don't understand.
- Yes, you do.

393
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,901
Why don't you tell me
what he did to you and Angela.

394
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,449
Just forget it, okay.

395
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,736
I understand how these things
might be difficult...

396
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,371
They're things that didn't happen!

397
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:38,748
If they didn't happen, then why
do you need to raise your voice to say it.

398
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,668
You've been through something
very traumatic.

399
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,799
It's quite normal for the
mechanisms in the brain“.

400
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,676
Are you deaf! Huh?

401
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,837
All right, take it easy okay.

402
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,890
Sit down. We're just talking.

403
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,396
Roy, I'm a police officer.

404
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,023
I'm going to tell you
what I'm looking at.

405
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,777
I'm looking at a young man.
Who doesn't speak to his sister.

406
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:08,065
Doesn't speak to his father.
And is living in an abandoned building.

407
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,112
What's wrong with you?

408
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,825
You need to stop fighting everybody
and find the real enemy,

409
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,866
the person who made you feel
exactly like him.

410
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,409
A loser.

411
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:27,258
I have a very simple
proposition for you, Roy.

412
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:32,014
Let's go back to your bedroom, search your
adolescence, even your childhood.

413
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:37,436
Review all those moments
that were weird.

414
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,980
Weird? What do you mean weird?

415
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,313
We're looking for someone in a hood, Roy.

416
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,902
(kids playing)

417
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,493
(clicking)

418
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,248
(Roy) I hear voices.

419
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,461
Where?

420
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,629
Behind the door.
Whispering.

421
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,308
Which door are you talking about.

422
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,516
It's my old room.

423
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,024
It's opening.

424
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,813
I... I see them.

425
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,985
Wearing hoods.

426
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,197
Can you see your father?

427
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:39,243
I don't know.
I can't make out their faces.

428
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,704
Why not? Make up, maybe?

429
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:46,331
Yeah.” they look like“. witches.

430
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,835
What are they doing?

431
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,596
Come on, you know.

432
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,090
I don't know”.

433
00:36:57,257 --> 00:37:01,512
It's not what you think Roy.
It's what you don't want to think.

434
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,814
(gasps)

435
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,479
(whispers) I don't know”.

436
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,368
I can't stop...

437
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,709
Something doesn't fit.

438
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:33,260
In his vision, Roy saw himself as a child.
Yes?

439
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,214
And the other sister says the abuse
began only last year.

440
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,759
Yeah but see, for me that's the
typical progressive revelation.

441
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,974
For me, what doesn't fit is
he said there was six

442
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:48,855
people in his room' How do you get six
people in and out of that room without...

443
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,143
The grandmother.

444
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,610
And she had John when she was
barely sixteen years old.

445
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:59,245
Everybody knew she was into some bad stuff,
I see no reason for us to rule her out.

446
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:02,034
Of course I should have realized.

447
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,709
Some of us can use
our heads too, Professor.

448
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,609
- What is the meaning of all this!
- Mrs. Gray!

449
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,490
- You already searched the house yesterday.
- Rose. Rose.

450
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:40,402
- Today they're destroying it!
- You need to stay calm.

451
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,196
- Nobody has explained anything to me,
- Rose! Rose! Listen to ma!

452
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,324
None of this is necessary. All right.

453
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:49,961
I'll talk to Brody and right now we'll
get these men out of your house.

454
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,588
Yeah? Well then why don't you?

455
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,965
You know where the photographs are.

456
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,013
I talked to Roy and he told us.

457
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:08,726
You're lying!
(yells) You are lying!

458
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,067
My Grandson didn't...

459
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:22,948
(wails)

460
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,327
She's been drinking.

461
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,121
<i>Haw you Gain' boss'?</i>

462
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,957
Listen, Brody and I are
going bowling later.

463
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,794
You should join us.
Gonna blow off some steam.

464
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:41,508
What?

465
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,595
You need to disconnect, Boss.

466
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:50,768
Yeah, no thanks boys.
Don't you disconnect too much all right?

467
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,653
Are you a police officer?

468
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,358
Yes.

469
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,452
Did you sexually abuse Angela Gray?

470
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,617
No.

471
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,750
- Is today Friday?
- Yes.

472
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,671
- Did you sexually abuse Roy Gray.
- No.

473
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,218
An FBI report.

474
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,759
I hate it when you're always right.

475
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,436
This could be huge Bruce.

476
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,810
A cult of Satanists.

477
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:38,896
They've suspected it for seven years.
Ever since the book came out.

478
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:48,368
They shelved it last month,
can you believe it? I mean, take a look.

479
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,035
Rumours about rituals everywhere,
like they're connected.

480
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,954
But not a shred of evidence what-so-ever.

481
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,212
We'll find the proof.

482
00:40:57,747 --> 00:41:01,547
Kate just called me,
if we don't find something,

483
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:05,343
-we're going to have to release him.
- What? Nesbitt?

484
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:06,848
It's the law, Bruce.

485
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:11,512
You mean that this guy is part of a
Satanic cult and we're going to let him go?

486
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:13,271
<i>Do you know any pornographic
pictures of Angela Gray?</i>

487
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,727
- No.
- You're lying!

488
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,317
(phone rings)

489
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,945
Kenner speaking.

490
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:25,192
All we tried to do was
lift her shin and she panicked.

491
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:35,623
Hey Angela, it's Bruce. Bruce Kenner.
Will you open the door'?

492
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,312
Listen, Doctor just wants to
inspect your mark.

493
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,310
What's the problem?

494
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,562
- Would you prefer if it was a female?
-It's not that,

495
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,484
What is it?

496
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,609
Tell me, what is it?

497
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,826
If I show it to you, they'll kill me

498
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:26,883
You listen to me. Right now it's incredibly
important that you tell us everything.

499
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,389
We think that your grandmother...

500
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:34,848
Come on there were more
people there, with painted faces.

501
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,809
Why won't you confirm it?

502
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,812
The Devil is on their side.

503
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,692
The Devil doesn't exist.

504
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,524
There's good people. okay.
And there's bad people'

505
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:54,372
And unfortunately these
people are real scum'

506
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:58,206
But good people, like you,
are stronger than they are.

507
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,337
Yes you are.
People say that you're shy.

508
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:07,878
But I don't see that.
I see someone who is incredibly brave.

509
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:16,395
Someone who has been through living
hell and made it stop, all by yourself.

510
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:22,685
Now you just need to take
one more step, okay, and trust me.

511
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:05,234
(whisper)

512
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,605
Now they'll kill you too.

513
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:30,961
<i>(Angela) ...their headlights woke me up.</i>

514
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,300
<i>I saw them get out of the cars,
and they were wearing robes.</i>

515
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,809
<i>They were headed for my
Dad's workshop.</i>

516
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:48,191
<i>After a while I heard
a knock at the door.</i>

517
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:53,616
They were going to break it down
like the other times.

518
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,902
<i>So I opened it.</i>

519
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,866
(Bruce) Who were they?

520
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:05,662
It was my Grandmother,
dressed like them.

521
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,211
<i>She took me downstairs.</i>

522
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:15,676
<i>She had this weird smile on her face.</i>

523
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:20,218
<i>-(Angela) Like...
-(Bruce) Like she was drugged.</i>

524
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,808
<i>Yeah.</i>

525
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:29,902
I saw that we were headed
for my Dad's workshop.

526
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:37,861
<i>I could hear chanting and...</i>

527
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,533
<i>...squealing inside.</i>

528
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,090
<i>I! was a black mass.</i>

529
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:04,680
<i>I know {hey were
doing stuff in the comers.</i>

530
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:08,808
<i>Like fornicating.</i>

531
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,401
<i>Tenure.</i>

532
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:17,154
<i>There was blood, everywhere.</i>

533
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,375
<i>There was a woman with a pitcher.</i>

534
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:32,374
<i>She said. {his isn't happening.
Ifs all a dream.</i>

535
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:39,222
<i>But there was like this altar.</i>

536
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:43,848
And my Grandmother's:
"look at your Dad."

537
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:48,727
<i>"It's his big night."</i>

538
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:57,733
<i>Then... they brought out a baby.</i>

539
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:07,955
...and they each brought out a knife.

540
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:10,954
And they started stabbing it!

541
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:14,086
And they started eating it!

542
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:17,176
<i>I know they did this
to other mothers of the sect.</i>

543
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:20,760
<i>They burned the remains and
buried them on my dad's property!</i>

544
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,639
<i>Please find them!</i>

545
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,550
<i>They got to be there.</i>

546
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:37,981
...can't alter the bottom.
Okay. So just the grass...

547
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:40,445
- How long is it going to take?
-.'.two or three inches“.

548
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:43,111
Okay, it's very big.
We got to do it in sections.

549
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,575
- How long?
- We got to locate places where ditches...

550
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:48,457
- How long is it going to take?
- I don't know, Bruce, maybe a month!

551
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:51,165
You're all about not making any mistakes.
What are you doing? You come down here...

552
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:53,955
(yells) We don't have a month, Farrell!

553
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:57,375
Do you have any idea
what we are up against!

554
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:01,717
No, why would I? Why would I, Bruce?
You're the one with all the answers. Right?

555
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,098
You're right. You're right, okay.

556
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:09,346
Give this a listen. I already have it
memorized' Okay. Knock yourself out.

557
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:15,314
- What about the FBI?
-It's not going to lift a finger...

558
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:18,480
...until we have some hard evidence.
So we are on our own.

559
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:21,741
We got another call.
About twenty people in dark clothes.

560
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,243
Somebody heard "weird music."
- Send someone over.

561
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,575
It's probably those Gum's again.

562
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,365
- Who do we send, Chief? Everybody's here.
- Find someone, Tom!

563
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:34,413
Call the D.A. and tell him we can't
keep this up. And shut that damn door.

564
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,257
All right. Professor Raines?

565
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:42,546
Well John is responding well to therapy.

566
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:46,591
But he hasn't been able to identify
any of the faces that he's sees,

567
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,601
- You think he's trying to buy time?
- No, no. I don't think so.

568
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:54,107
You know Chief, I don't think he's telling
us everything. Let me talk to him a bit.

569
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,983
Work him, try to get
something out of him.

570
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:59,316
You don't know what you're talking about.
Keep your mouth closed.

571
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:03,779
Angela, what are you doing here?
Are you all right?

572
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:06,577
I was looking for you.

573
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,658
All right. Well...

574
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,333
Please. Sit down.

575
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:28,258
- You're not going to believe me.
- What happened?

576
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:31,389
I think they were following me.

577
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:35,101
- Just now as I was leaving the bookstore.
- Well who was?

578
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:37,687
I don't know who they are. But

579
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:42,898
I could feel 'em mixed in with
everyone on the street. Just...

580
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:44,986
Watching me.

581
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,079
- You don't believe me.
-It's not that, Angela.

582
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,410
Please. Sit down.

583
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,163
Half the city is in shock right now.

584
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,463
I went to your father's
workshop the other day.

585
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:04,802
And I saw everything.
I was terrified.

586
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,381
It was just suggestion.

587
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,477
My mother was followed.

588
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:17,060
She told me just before the accident.

589
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,652
Your brother told us.

590
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,823
- I should get your statement.
- I don't want to burden anyone.

591
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:30,031
You're not a burden.
All right, ifs my job to protect you.

592
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,788
Let me go get my recorder,
and I'll be right back.

593
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,766
You okay?

594
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:11,073
- Thank you but I...
-it's to protect you.

595
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,874
All right. I appreciate it.

596
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,585
My Dad said you were a jerk.

597
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:24,040
That you always complained
when he fixed your car.

598
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,959
Sometimes I get pissed off
when people don't do their job well.

599
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,755
I'm not exactly what you
might call a nice guy. You know?

600
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,138
Yes you are.

601
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:35,972
To me, at least.

602
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:43,150
- Good night.
- Good night.

603
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,398
And hey, hey. Thank you.

604
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,810
<i>(Bruce) This happened today?
What time?</i>

605
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,900
<i>(Angela) Around three o'clock.
Between Main and Timothy.</i>

606
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:47,172
<i>(Bruce) And what exactly did
your mother tell you ?</i>

607
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:50,214
<i>(Angela) It was one of their tactics.</i>

608
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:54,343
<i>They blend in with people on the
street and start staring at someone.</i>

609
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,052
(Bruce) What for?

610
00:52:57,466 --> 00:53:00,970
<i>-(Angela) It's</i> a <i>death threat.
- How did she know?</i>

611
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,394
<i>She never said.</i>

612
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,768
<i>But she died right after.</i>

613
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:13,817
<i>Sometimes they'd call in the
middle of the night and hang up.</i>

614
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,989
<i>That's a warning.</i>

615
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,448
<i>A warning?</i>

616
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,908
<i>Yeah, it's like”.</i>

617
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:23,451
<i>An invitation. To be one of them.</i>

618
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:26,105
(whisper)

619
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,528
(Hold him)

620
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:51,167
Shh...

621
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:23,158
(chanting)

622
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:11,077
(breathes heavily)

623
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:29,599
So much depravity.
So much evil.

624
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:31,977
How...

625
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:36,519
How does he fool us? Just when
I thought my life was back on track,

626
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:40,780
my mother and I away
from temptation from the Devil.

627
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,071
That's right when I was closest to him.

628
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,453
You don't know, John?

629
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,914
- You really don't know?
- Bruce.

630
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,576
You had no idea what you were getting into?

631
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:58,253
There's no Devil, John'
There's only you. You're the Devil.

632
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:02,587
What about your wife?
You ready to confess to killing her?

633
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:06,428
- No... I didn't“. It was an accident.
-(yells) Bull shit!

634
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,052
The threats, the anonymous phone calls.
People stalking her.

635
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,437
You didn't know anything about that.

636
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:16,351
Quit praying and drawing things
and give me names!

637
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,734
- Are you sure you can handle this?
- What are you talking about?

638
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:23,524
This case is affecting everyone.
And you as well.

639
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,567
No need to play the tough guy.

640
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:31,161
Half the cops on this case are dragging ass
because I put one of our own behind bars.

641
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:35,662
The other half are complete idiots
to begin with. That's what's affecting me.

642
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,250
What about the nightmares?

643
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,422
Are you going to tell me
you're the only one not having any?

644
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,178
No, no I'm having them.

645
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:48,181
Luckily we all have you
to take care of us Professor.

646
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,725
Angela.

647
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:02,484
Clear something up for me and”.
these gentlemen,

648
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,615
Why did you let the Reverend
tell me what your father did.

649
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:12,281
Why? If you already
knew I was involved?

650
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:19,004
Because you don't
remember, Grandma.

651
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:24,418
I thought I was going crazy.

652
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:28,593
Because you'd walk around as if...

653
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,842
everything was normal.

654
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,892
But then I realized”.

655
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,275
That's a lie!

656
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,688
Hey. Rose. Rose.

657
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:47,825
I want to talk to my grandson!
Talk to Roy! He knows me!

658
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:50,452
He knows that I would
never do such a thing.

659
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:55,537
Listen Rose, it's your own son that's
telling us, Rose' You understand that?

660
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,539
(Raines) Take another look
at John's drawings

661
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:01,626
-and see if there's something”.
- I don't kill babies!

662
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:02,789
I know who I am.

663
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:06,051
I think you and I
should go on with the therapy.

664
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:11,135
You just don't...
just don't remember.

665
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:16,478
I know who! am!
(yells) I know who I am!

666
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:21,184
(Reverend) I think I better take you home.
(Rose cries)

667
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:25,108
Come Rose.

668
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:28,398
You will pay for this!

669
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,242
(Angela cries)

670
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:25,669
You were right.
This case is getting to me.

671
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,294
Since we've had
absolutely no progress.

672
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:34,135
Nothing. This is impossible.

673
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:37,510
There are too many pieces here.

674
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:44,483
John blocked his memories
because they defied his morality.

675
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:50,489
And his son Roy is a defence mechanism.
All right, very well. But now Rose.

676
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,734
You're the one that said
the mind is a whole universe.

677
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,153
Oh God I say that crap sometimes.

678
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:05,087
What about from a
non-scientific standpoint?

679
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:10,091
(Raines) Non-scientific.

680
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:14,676
What are you implying -
that we were all possessed by the Devil?

681
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:17,091
I'm just trying to keep
an open mind.

682
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:37,069
It wasn't you, Rose.

683
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,405
It was his will.

684
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,618
And he is the one we're up against.

685
01:01:55,545 --> 01:02:00,392
<i>You can't be too careful. The men and women
who have sworn to serve</i> Satan

686
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,895
<i>will do anything to spread
the fear among us.</i>

687
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,523
(phone rings)
No one can...

688
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,486
Yeah Chief, I'm watching it.

689
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:17,863
Who is this?

690
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:22,910
Hello?

691
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,457
Hello?

<i>...a baby.</i>

695
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:42,510

698
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,277
<i>Who was accused of
being a Satanist.</i>

699
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,788
<i>This could mean that
Satanic activity has branched out.</i>

<i>Creating</i> a <i>network that is
terrifying as it is invisible.</i>

707

What's wrong with you?

You silly cat.
Come out of there.

(police siren)

735
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:06,637
Did you look at that window?

736
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,090
Looks like she was trying to getaway.

737
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:11,134
See, what did I tell you, man.

738
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:13,429
The somebody pushed her.
And the house is clean.

739
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,643
You know exactly what I said.

740
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,728
What's going on, Charlie?

741
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:22,737
Boss, I never really believe
in this sort of stuff.

742
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:24,609
But?

743
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:27,943
But I'm starting to think this won't help.

744
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,614
Those people are just flesh and bone.

745
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,249
I'm not talking about people, Boss.

746
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:53,135
We're waiting for her to confess.
So right now she'll stay in the hospital.

747
01:06:53,885 --> 01:06:56,684
- I feel like this is all my fault.
<i>- No,</i> God...

748
01:06:57,138 --> 01:07:01,439
It's true. I've mined their lives, Bruce.

749
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:04,650
- Please don't say that again.
- You don't understand.

750
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:07,031
I know I should hate them.

751
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:10,614
But they're my family.

752
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:19,160
I talk to her every day.

753
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:23,043
She left us.

754
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:26,334
All of us.

755
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:29,254
Despite everything my Dad
put her through.

756
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:37,137
You don't believe, do you?
In praying.

757
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:43,356
I believe in you, Angela. I do.

758
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:46,362
(Bruce) I really do.

759
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,289
You're all I've got, Bruce.

760
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:10,008
- Sorry,
- Angela, I'm sorry.

761
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:16,350
-(Angela) I've never...
- Now listen'

762
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:21,769
Listen, forgive me, okay.
I'm sorry. I have to go.

763
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:30,820
What are you doing, Bruce?

764
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:34,410
What are you doing?

765
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:57,846
Roy...

766
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:01,141
Oh Roy.

767
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:09,146
Grandma, what happened?

768
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:12,904
They hounded me.

769
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:21,034
So I wouldn't tell,
what I did to you.

770
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:25,750
Grandma, you never did anything to me.

771
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,880
You were always good to
me.

772
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:30,166
Accepted me as I am.

773
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:33,883
Horrible things.

774
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:36,472
Horrible things“.

775
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,309
I know that now.

776
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,692
Don't talk to her anymore.

777
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,652
- You're making her crazy.
- What happened?

778
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:56,409
- You really think she saw the Devil?
- Roy.

779
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:59,241
She suffered a
spontaneous regression.

780
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:02,203
Now we need to separate
the real from the imagined.

781
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:04,367
She started drinking again,
she's delirious.

782
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,332
- Roy.
- You're a fraud.

783
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,212
Just like him.

784
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,505
You think I don't remember?

785
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:17,013
Always preaching, sticking your nose into
other people's lives.

786
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:20,050
Like you did with mine!
You and your fucking church!

787
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:23,853
I'm very sorry you feel that way, Roy.

788
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:28,141
Will you at least come
and see your sister?

789
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:34,989
I should go.

790
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:39,995
I got a better idea.
Why don't all of your just go.

791
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,742
Leave us alone.

792
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:59,181
He's only trying to protect Rose.
We have to talk to him again.

793
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:01,887
(Reverend) You don't know what
you're up against.

794
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:05,519
Don't you see it?
He's with them now.

795
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:08,314
And I don't think even he knows it.

796
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:11,484
- All of this is Satan's work.
- Oh come on.

797
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,610
I'm talking about evil.

798
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:18,612
- Evil itself.
- Evil itself? Listen, Reverend.

799
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:23,701
No. The Devil will do
the same thing to you.

800
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:28,619
As he's doing to John's family.
He'll find a way to confuse you.

801
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:30,999
To tempt you.

802
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,758
I've already handed out
quite a few at the station.

803
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:42,515
- You did what?
-It can't do any harm.

804
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,359
(Reverend) Good night.

805
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:58,777
- Why don't you just admit it?
- Admit what?

806
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,942
That you're scared to death.

807
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,578
You're not using your head anymore.

808
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:07,410
Raines...

809
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:44,949
<i>(Bruce from recording) And what exactly did
your mother tell you?</i>

810
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:47,660
<i>(Angela) It was one of their tactics.</i>

811
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:51,201
<i>They blend in with people on the street
and start staring at someone.</i>

812
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,914
(Bruce) What for?

813
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:56,839
(Angela) <i>It's</i> a death threat.

<i>(Angela) Sometimes they'd call
in the middle of the night and hang up.</i>

821
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:53,308
<i>That's a warning.</i>

822
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:56,357
<i>-(Bruce) A warning?
- Yeah, it's like”.</i>

823
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:01,942
<i>an invitation to be one of them.</i>

(woman) Bruce?

825
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,662
Are you all right?

826
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:22,959
- Where am l...
- Shh..,

827
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:27,846
Tell them he's ready.

828
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:34,720
(Bruce) Nesbitt...

829
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:39,400
- This can't be real.
-(woman) Of course it's not real.

830
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,856
- You're in custody.
-It's not happening, Bruce.

831
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:44,238
-(woman) This is a dream.
- Come on.

832
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:48,526
Walk slowly.

833
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,831
Hold him,
he's still a bit dizzy.

834
01:14:56,534 --> 01:15:00,289
- Watch your step, Bruce.
- What are you all doing in my house?

835
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:02,627
-(man) Let him through.
- Gel out of my house.

836
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:04,713
(woman) Make way. Make way.

837
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:07,469
- Ge( out of my house!
-(woman) This is not your house.

838
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:21,192
(woman) You're dreaming, Bruce.

839
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:23,769
(baby cries)

840
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,938
This isn't real.

841
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:34,280
Give him the knife.

842
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:08,190
No! No!

843
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:11,409
No! No!

844
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:21,377
Don't cry sweetheart.

845
01:16:22,078 --> 01:16:27,005
It's only a dream.
Our secret recipe.

846
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:31,129
Go on. Drink.

847
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,844
I'm not one of you!

848
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:40,556
I'm not one of you!
I'm not one of you!

849
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,123
(prays)

850
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:20,011
Come on Lady.

851
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,525
Tough luck.

852
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:45,961
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on!

853
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,212
Come on.

854
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:10,436
Morning.

855
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:27,328
What are you doing here?
What the fuck are you doing here!

856
01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:29,667
- Hey! Hey!
- Jesus Christ, Bruce!

857
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:32,003
This man is under arrest! Get off me!

858
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:35,511
Who authorized his release!
Get the fuck off me!

859
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,427
He came here to pick up his stuff.

860
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:42,518
They released him
yesterday afternoon.

861
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:44,553
I tried to call you
but you never answered.

862
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,816
- But why! Why did you release him?
- He passed the polygraph twice,

863
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:51,185
Polygraph...
- We had no choice.

864
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:54,025
- That's the deal we had with his lawyer."
- What deal?

865
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:56,862
I know he's lying, Chief! I know it.

866
01:18:57,024 --> 01:19:00,949
Bruce, relax. Relax okay.
He'll never work here again.

867
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:04,741
Look. Look.
May I'? It's not just the test.

868
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:07,660
We got back the results
of Angela's medical report.

869
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:11,421
And the mark's superficial, it was recent,
it was probably self-inflicted'

870
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:14,254
- I saw... I saw...
- Oh for Christ's sake. You're not a doctor.

871
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:17,511
- But I saw...
- You saw wrong.

872
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:20,014
It's typical in trauma victims to want to

873
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:23,802
strengthen their testimony
by adding little details.

874
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:25,936
Do we know who signed this report?

875
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:29,144
- Bruce.
- No, they already be among us!

876
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:31,475
I don't believe any of it.

877
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:36,022
I got my hands full with these guys.
Please, don't let all this get to you.

878
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,027
- Not to you.
- What...

879
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:41,490
You said you were being
watched on the street today.

880
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:46,373
Have you seen yourself
in the mirror recently?

881
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:55,341
Why don't you just go home and
forget about the case for a few days.

882
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:57,627
Somethings happening to you.

883
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:41,880
<i>This is Detective Bruce Kenner.
It is October the fourteenth. 1990.</i>

884
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:45,266
<i>- Stale you! full name.
- John Gray.</i>

885
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:59,730
<i>-...hugging or kissing me...
- So she's been avoiding you?</i>

886
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:02,446
<i>Yeah. And also...</i>

887
01:21:02,608 --> 01:21:06,738
<i>John. cut the shit okay.
Take your hat off.</i>

888
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:21,252
(rewinds)

889
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:24,046
<i>Yeah and then also...</i>

890
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:27,342
<i>John. cut the shit okay.
Take your hat...</i>

891
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:33,768
Shit.

892
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,383
<i>- She's been avoiding you'?
- Yeah.</i>

893
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:03,381
<i>And then also the...</i>

894
01:22:03,544 --> 01:22:06,093
<i>John. cut the shit okay.
Take your...</i>

895
01:22:06,547 --> 01:22:10,723
You were making a list of things
that were obvious and I cut you off.

896
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:13,728
What was it you were going to say?
What made you feel guilty.

897
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:18,980
Well I think it had to
do with my son, Roy.

898
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:24,528
He's umm...
Just saying the word makes me sick.

899
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,658
What word?

900
01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:29,069
He's a sodomite.

901
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:31,200
He's a what?

902
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,115
That's why I kicked him out.

903
01:22:34,241 --> 01:22:35,743
That means he's gay?

904
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:40,089
No... well at church we
call them sodomites.

905
01:22:40,873 --> 01:22:44,969
Those are sins that people
always learn from some pervert.

906
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:48,556
And then when Angela
started accusing me,

907
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:55,142
I.“ I saw it clearly. It was me.
I was the pervert'

908
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,230
Wait a second.

909
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:03,904
Are you telling me that you're taking the
blame for sexually abusing your daughter

910
01:23:04,062 --> 01:23:05,780
-because your son is gay?
- Yeah.

911
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:09,660
John, and you waited
to tell me that until now!

912
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:12,037
- Why... Why are you angry?
- Now you tell me!

913
01:23:12,196 --> 01:23:14,995
- Why are you so angry?
- Oh God, John!

914
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:18,161
- I'm only trying to help you.
- Bullshit you're trying to help me!

915
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,204
- Are you playing games with me?
- No sir!

916
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,498
Hey look at me,
are you playing games!

917
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:24,917
No, I never lied to you. sir!

918
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:32,308
You don't think I want to put an end
to all of this? I'd do anything, Bruce.

919
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:36,596
Anything to pay for what I've done.

920
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:45,405
To my children.
And I don't know what else to do.

921
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:14,026
(truck horn)

922
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:35,673
(bark)

923
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:40,181
Move.

924
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:44,397
You never rest, do you?

925
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:46,809
I have a question.
Just need a simple yes or no answer.

926
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,524
Please just for a second
can you just listen to me”.

927
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:51,859
Can these dogs please shut up!

928
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:57,327
Look at this, please.

929
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:00,489
You see this picture?

930
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:05,707
I thought I knew her, I was sure that
I knew her but ifs an advertisement.

931
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:09,590
Obviously. It's been up
all over town. It's a drawing.

932
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:14,879
Right? But ever since the case began, I've
been thinking about her. I put her there.

933
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:17,514
I don't know her.
She's not even real.

934
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:22,015
What if the regressions
are the same thing'

935
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:27,017
They're not memories.
They're fantasies.

936
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,526
- They're induced fantasies.
-Induced by who?

937
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:35,032
By us' By the therapy.
By police, by the media.

938
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:39,240
We bombard them with
the same thing over and over.

939
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:42,080
And their imagination
just does the rest.

940
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:47,290
We're not freeing their memories.
This is a nightmare produced by all of us.

941
01:26:51,957 --> 01:26:54,301
- Collective hysteria.
- Yeah. Yeah.

942
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:01,387
It doesn't make sense,
What about Nesbitt?

943
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:04,679
You know he's guilty or
are you doubting that now?

944
01:27:04,845 --> 01:27:06,847
No. No. George Nesbitt
is guilty, but maybe.”

945
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:08,811
- Maybe what?
- I don't know.

946
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:10,851
Stop clutching at straws.

947
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:14,738
I'm not clutching at straws.
I'm trying to find the truth.

948
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:16,990
You're demolishing my work!

949
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:19,197
- Okay, all right...
- This is science.

950
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:22,329
- This is science!
- I'm starting to use my head again!

951
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:25,869
Goodbye Professor.

952
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:40,714
Nesbitt, what did you do?

953
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:45,093
What did you do.

954
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:55,417
Drop that! Get over there!

955
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:59,084
Let me see your faces!
Both of you, let me see your faces!

956
01:29:06,716 --> 01:29:08,343
(Farrell) You had it coming.

957
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:10,638
For ruining his life you bastard.

958
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:16,272
His life? They just let him go!

959
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:21,190
- What you came over here to celebrate?
- What am I supposed to do now, huh?

960
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:23,734
- What about my career?
- Your career.“

961
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:28,030
Fine. Yeah I made some mistakes.
But I shouldn't have to pay for all this!

962
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:32,417
You got what you wanted. Two stooges for
your bull shit case! You'll get a medal!

963
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:34,999
All right, listen to me right now.

964
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:37,835
I'm not going to report this.

965
01:29:37,998 --> 01:29:41,923
This stays between us.
Just tell me what you know, Nesbitt!

966
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:44,087
- Tell you what?
- What you kept from us.

967
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:46,256
What only you know about it.

968
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:49,680
(George laughs)

969
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:52,304
Only me?

970
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:56,149
I told you that day in the car.

971
01:29:57,893 --> 01:29:59,145
Am I right?

972
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:08,657
(soft piano music)

973
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:24,882
I need to speak with Angela.

974
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:29,762
- What happened?
- I've solved the case.

975
01:30:31,593 --> 01:30:33,140
We've go! them all.

976
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:35,559
I'll get her.

977
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:45,486
Hello, Angela.

978
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:49,031
Did you really?

979
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,781
Nesbitt gave us all the names.

980
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:57,203
Yeah I know, I know,
I know' Sit down. Sit down.

981
01:30:57,577 --> 01:30:59,124
You'll be fine.

982
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:06,136
Angela. I know something
terrible happened to you.

983
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:11,766
And I understand why maybe you
didn't want to tell me this until now.

984
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:18,064
Nesbitt said they go! you pregnant.

985
01:31:21,977 --> 01:31:25,572
Did they want you to have
a baby for the sect?

986
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:31,404
(reverend) Angela. Don't hold
anything back' Tell us everything.

987
01:31:34,447 --> 01:31:38,122
He also told us”.

988
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:43,291
...that there was a ceremony
where they gave you an abortion.

989
01:31:53,591 --> 01:31:55,810
Please tell me they didn't...

990
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:59,606
Put a foetus“.

991
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:16,740
Angela.

992
01:32:27,751 --> 01:32:30,004
What is the meaning of this?

993
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:31,797
What's the meaning of it?

994
01:32:35,091 --> 01:32:37,059
It means I made it all up.

995
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:41,564
- Why are you lying?
- Angela.

996
01:32:42,474 --> 01:32:46,195
You have been playing us
from the start, all right. Was it you?

997
01:32:46,352 --> 01:32:48,946
- You were the one calling my house?
- I didn't call anyone.

998
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:50,903
You were calling my house.

999
01:32:51,441 --> 01:32:53,284
You know what
Nesbitt really told me?

1000
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:57,573
He told me that you hate your family.

1001
01:32:57,906 --> 01:33:00,409
That you think they're all
a bunch of drunk losers.

1002
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:04,455
And that your mother killed herself
because she couldn't lake it anymore.

1003
01:33:04,621 --> 01:33:06,248
That's a lie.

1004
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:10,089
You really opened up to George. And then
you guys were sleeping together, right.

1005
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:13,176
I mean, when he told you
he would never run away with a minor...

1006
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:16,888
And you saw that your life was going to be
like your mothers, you wanted to change it.

1007
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:19,348
Why were you crying
that day at the seminar?

1008
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:22,390
I already told you why,
her father raped her.

1009
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:26,105
No. Can I talk to you for a second.

1010
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:30,397
- What are you doing?
- Just come, speak with me for one second.

1011
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:34,572
Next time you hear
the voice of God, don't call us.

1012
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:36,611
Are you out of your mind!

1013
01:33:36,778 --> 01:33:39,702
<i>Open this door light now! Mr. Kenner!</i>

1014
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:41,366
You just told us
what we wanted to hear

1015
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:44,537
while getting rid of your family.
Isn't that right Angela?

1016
01:33:44,702 --> 01:33:48,752
Then you went too far,
and now you can't stop. Isn't that right?

1017
01:33:54,712 --> 01:33:57,056
Who's going to believe you, Bruce?

1018
01:33:58,383 --> 01:34:02,388
Especially when I tell everyone
what you did in the cemetery'

1019
01:34:03,263 --> 01:34:05,311
In front of my mother's grave.

1020
01:34:12,105 --> 01:34:15,029
You just offended someone
who loved you very much.

1021
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:18,448
I offended you?

1022
01:34:19,988 --> 01:34:21,535
You think I care?

1023
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:24,201
I was talking about your mother.

1024
01:34:33,918 --> 01:34:35,465
Get out of my church.

1025
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:39,640
You were right, Reverend.

1026
01:34:40,049 --> 01:34:41,596
Get out!

1027
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:44,729
It does exist. Evil itself.

1028
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:55,031
<i>Now the police have no leads. Which is very
common in cases of Satanic Ritual abuse.</i>

1029
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:58,535
<i>But that begs the question,
where's the proof?</i>

1030
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:02,367
<i>(man) The Devil knows where the proof is.</i>

1031
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:06,285
<i>He's the one guiding and
helping his henchmen conceal it.</i>

1032
01:35:07,493 --> 01:35:10,121
<i>To make us believe
that he doesn't exist.</i>

1033
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:15,802
<i>I saw what they did! They killed
babies and sometimes they ale them.</i>

1034
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:19,510
<i>Then they'd burn the remains
and bury them on my Dad's properly.</i>

1035
01:35:19,672 --> 01:35:21,595
<i>They said they would kill me.</i>

1036
01:35:21,758 --> 01:35:25,934
<i>I chose to speak out about this
so the people would know the truth.</i>

1037
01:35:26,095 --> 01:35:28,769
<i>This is so much bigger
than what it seems'</i>

1038
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:33,645
<i>I only hope that people realize
the enormous danger we're in.</i>

1039
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:39,360
<i>People need to believe use
Believe us.</i>

1040
01:35:41,277 --> 01:35:45,828
That's the scariest part,
We believed it.

1041
01:35:48,952 --> 01:35:52,547
Hey, you did good.

1042
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:00,217
Let's go.

1043
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:36,044
(Bruce) Angela must've read it.

1044
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:40,633
Or else she saw one of those shows
she's doing interviews on now.

1045
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:42,547
Doesn't matter, it's all trash.

1046
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:46,810
The rest is just outbreaks of panic
like the one we had here.

1047
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:49,600
The FBI had already filed all this.

1048
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:56,690
But... I don't get it. What about my
visions, and my mothers and Roy's?

1049
01:36:56,853 --> 01:36:58,400
They all match,
how is that possible?

1050
01:36:58,563 --> 01:37:01,157
You saw what we made you believe,
and we believed what you saw.

1051
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:06,868
We just went around in a circle. The
tortures, the photographs, the sacrifices.

1052
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:09,574
We all just made it up.

1053
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:16,965
I spoke with the D.A.
All right, now listen.

1054
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:20,547
Nobody wants to take
the blame for this mess, okay.

1055
01:37:20,710 --> 01:37:23,133
They're going to want you
to confess to child molestation,

1056
01:37:23,296 --> 01:37:25,845
but you can't do it
because they don't have a case.

1057
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:30,471
The only one who should
be worried right now is Angela.

1058
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:34,015
No you just...
Leave Angela alone.

1059
01:37:34,182 --> 01:37:38,858
Please leave her alone.
First you said I was the Devil, Remember?

1060
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:56,838
All those years, drinkin'
and destroying myself

1061
01:37:57,914 --> 01:38:03,171
and not taking care
of my family until Emily...

1062
01:38:03,336 --> 01:38:06,590
John, You have to stop punishing yourself.

1063
01:38:06,923 --> 01:38:09,426
Emily gave up.
My wife gave up.

1064
01:38:11,511 --> 01:38:15,311
And Angela never complained.
She never said anything.

1065
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:17,983
All this hate now.

1066
01:38:20,395 --> 01:38:21,942
It's my fault.

1067
01:38:24,941 --> 01:38:29,162
- I'm the one that made her into this.
- I am the one who failed you.

1068
01:38:29,779 --> 01:38:35,081
Don't you see? From the beginning,
I couldn't see what was happening.

1069
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:38,587
I thought that this case”.

1070
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:42,549
That I was the only one...

1071
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:46,587
I was so stupid, John.

1072
01:38:47,463 --> 01:38:52,515
Please. Please, you have to at least
let me help you get out of here.

1073
01:38:56,931 --> 01:39:01,402
- You really want to help me?
- Yes.

1074
01:39:03,563 --> 01:39:05,907
Then you tell the D.A.
that I plead guilty.

1075
01:39:06,065 --> 01:39:08,864
No. John, you'll get
a minimum of five years.

1076
01:39:09,026 --> 01:39:14,453
I don't care, doesn't matter. As long as
you leave Angela alone. Don't go after her.

1077
01:39:17,827 --> 01:39:21,206
She'll realize I'm doing this for her,
to protect her.

1078
01:39:21,581 --> 01:39:23,709
And that way, maybe...

1079
01:39:24,542 --> 01:39:28,342
Maybe one day she'll hate me less.

1080
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:33,134
And that's all I want, see?
