00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,554
(lrish accent) I know who you are.

50
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,890
MAN: Good.

51
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,226
I know who you are.

(Sobs)

53
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:33,065
My brother's taken a bullet, Stanley,
and is in need of medical attention.

54
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:36,485
Well, allow me to address
the subject of your brother, Mr Burns.

55
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:43,116
Christmas, as you're probably aware,
is fast approaching.

56
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,329
And Christmas this year
will hold a unique significance

57
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,665
for young Micky here.

58
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,542
Mikey.

59
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,337
Because on Christmas Day,

60
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,966
I have made plans
that he be taken from the jail in Banyon

61
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,968
and hanged by the neck until he is dead.

62
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,845
Charlie.

63
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,055
You're a copper, Stanley,
not a judge and jury.

64
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:09,351
Well, clearly, Mr Burns,
I am what I wish to be.

65
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,606
So what is it that you want?

66
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,191
I want Arthur Burns.

67
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,152
I no longer ride with my brother.

68
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,654
(Groans)

69
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,826

(Whimpers and sobs)

71
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,457
Now, I will allow you
a moment to think about it.

72
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,753
(Mikey sobs)

73
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,188
What's happening, Charlie?

74
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,772
It's alright, Mikey.

75
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,482
(Mikey sobs)

76
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,984
It's alright.

77
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,034
(Stanley sighs)

78
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,204
STANLEY: Australia.

79
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,792
What fresh hell is this?

80
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:21,590
I have kept company
with bad men all my life.

81
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:26,637
I was 22 years
in Her Majesty's land forces.

82
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,847
I've dealt with your type many times.

83
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,682
Touch my brother again and I'll kill you.

84
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,110
Make no mistakes, Mr Burns.

85
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,155
It will be done. I will civilise this place.

86
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,282
What the fuck
are you talking about, Stanley?

87
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,414
Listen to me now, Charlie.

88
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,958
Don't speak.
(Mikey sobs)

89
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,085
Hush, Mikey. You'll be fine.

90
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,128
(Sobs and whimpers)

91
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,672
Hush.

92
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:04,758
(SILENCE)

93
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,349
I wish to present you with a proposition.

94
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,565
STANLEY:
I know where Arthur Burns is.

95
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,777
It is a godforsaken place.

96
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,994
The blacks won't go there,
nor the trackers.

97
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,912
Not even my own men.

98
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,669
I suppose, in time,
the bounty hunters will get him.

99
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,258
But I have other plans.

100
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,343
I aim to bring him down.

101
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,887
I aim to show

102
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,972
that he is a man like any other.

103
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,891
I aim to hurt him.

104
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,476
When you're ready, sir.

105
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,815
STANLEY: And what will most hurt him?

106
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,360
Hmm.

107
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,572
Well, I've thought
long and hard about that.

108
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:13,076
And I have realised, Mr Burns,

109
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:17,122
that I must become
a little more inventive in my methods.

110
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,631
Now, don't speak, Mr Burns.
Listen to me now.

111
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,674
Don't say a word.

112
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,930
Now, suppose I told you there was a way

113
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,433
to save your little brother
Mikey from the noose.

114
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,771
Suppose I gave you a horse<i>...</i>and a gun.

115
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,610
Suppose, Mr Burns,

116
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,863
I was to give both you
and your young brother, Mikey, here,

117
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,907
a pardon.

118
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:58,413
Suppose I said that I could give you

119
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,999
the chance to expunge the guilt<i>...</i>

120
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,627
<i>...</i>beneath which you so clearly labour.

121
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,964
Suppose I gave you till Christmas.

122
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:13,053
Now, suppose you tell me
what it is I want from you.

123
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,596
Hmm?

124
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,348
You want me to kill my brother.

125
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,309
I want you to kill your brother.

126
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:27,985
STANLEY: Arthur Burns is a monster.

127
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:31,446
An abomination.

SONG: # La, la, la. #

129
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,955
STANLEY: You were right
to part company with him

130
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,999
and to take Mikey with you.

131
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,045
What happened at the Hopkins place
was unforgivable.

I have never seen
such a sickening sight.

00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,637
Did you know that
that poor woman, Eliza Hopkins,

135
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,681
had a child in her belly?

136
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:57,908
STANLEY: Your business
with your brother is unfinished.

137
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,993
You have nine days, Mr Burns.

00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,339

MEN: Evening, Mrs Stanley.

164
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:19,776
You should<i>...</i> really not come here.

You men<i>...</i>

<i>...</i>you wait outside.

168
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,350
We spoke about
why you shouldn't come here.

169
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,893
This is not appropriate<i>...</i>

170
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,062
Morris, you've been gone for three days.

171
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,942
It's lonely up there at the house.

172
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,362
It's so quiet without you.

173
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:05,072
Are you coming home now?

174
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,616
Well, I have things to attend to.

175
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,579
I'll have Officer Dunn escort you home.

176
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,414
I'll be back soon.

177
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,416
You look terrible, Morris.

178
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,918
Yes.

179
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,881
Yes, I do.

180
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,679
STANLEY: Dunn.

181
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,389
MARTHA: Who is that?

182
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,059
But he's no more than a boy.

183
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,979
He's man enough, ma'am.
He's man enough, indeed.

184
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,939
STANLEY: Enough.
(Dunn sniggers)

185
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:49,491
Escort Mrs Stanley home
and wait there till I return.

186
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,410
How long will you be, dear?

187
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,911
Later.

188
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,549
Never speak to my wife
about such things again.

189
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,426
Do you understand?
My apologies, Captain.

190
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:10,971
What happened today on the flats,
that's between you and me.

191
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,806
Of course, sir.

192
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,475
Because there would be consequences
were it to become common knowledge.

193
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,644
Yes.

194
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:12,658
(Snores softly)

195
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:15,911
MARTHA: Eliza Hopkins
was a good Christian woman,

196
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:17,788
and she was my friend.

197
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:21,333
I pray to God that her death
was mercifully swift.

198
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,585
It was, wasn't it?

199
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:27,756
Martha, can we speak of other things?

200
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,468
Come here, Captain Stanley.

201
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,532
Mmm.

202
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:56,910

(Stanley breathes raggedly)

207
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:27,316
Don't be gloomy, dear.

208
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,362
This burden you carry<i>...</i>

209
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,366
<i>...</i>you might let me carry it too.

210
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,413

Oh, a thousand pardons, my dear man.

237
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:15,234
It appears that I am a little scuppered.

238
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:19,613
Oh, no need for that, sir.
No need for that.

239
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,782
We are white men, you and I.

240
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:25,911
Permit me to introduce myself.

00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,914
My name is Jellon Lamb.

242
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:31,208
Citizen of the world, you might say.

243
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,876
An adventurer.

244
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:38,674
And, if I may be so bold,
a man of no little education.

245
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,094
And you, sir?

246
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:46,473
By what name
am I honoured to address thee?

247
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:54,314
Of course, a<i>...</i> mere detail.

248
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,026
Mere detail.

249
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:02,823
Forgive me, sir, but I've been stuck here

250
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:07,661
with no-one but this sorry sack
of Hibernian pig shit for conversation.

251
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:12,624
Poor, poor Dan O'Reilly.

252
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,543

254
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:20,591
One more crack about the Irish,
Mr Lamb, and I'll shoot you.

255
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:22,134
Am I clear?

256
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:24,636
Oh, as the waters of Ennis, sir.

257
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,680
Let us drink, then, to the Irish.

258
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,059
No finer race of men
have ever<i>...</i> peeled a potato.

259
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,272
Do you pray, Mr Lamb?
Good Lord, son.

260
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:37,191
No, I do not.

261
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:40,360
I was, in days gone by, a believer.

262
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,948
But, alas, I came
to this beleaguered land

263
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,992
and the God in me just<i>...</i>

264
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,370

265
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,208
Let us change our toast, sir.

00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,919

Never raise a glass with a man
whose name you do not know.

270
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:14,978
My name is Charles Murphy.

271
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:30,994
Charles, eh?

272
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,538
Perhaps you've read

273
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:35,499
'On The Origin Of The Species
By Means Of Natural Selection'

274
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:37,417
by Charles Darwin.

275
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,086
Oh, don't be thrown by the title.

276
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:43,340
He had some most fascinating
things to say.

277
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,133
Chilling things.

278
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:51,098
Mr Darwin spent time
studying Aboriginals.

279
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:55,477
He claims we are, at bottom,

280
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:58,647
one and the same.

281
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:00,691
(Laughs)

282
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:06,697
He infers, Mr Murphy,

283
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:11,869
that we share
a common ancestry with monkeys.

284
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:15,831
(Laughs)

285
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:18,166
Monkeys!

286
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,253
(Laughs)

287
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:28,010
Mr Murphy, Russia, China, the Congo.

288
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,972
Oh, I have travelled
among unknown people

289
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:34,641
in lands beyond the seas.

290
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:39,479
But nothing<i>...</i>

291
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,690
<i>...</i>nothing could have prepared me

292
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,860
for this godforsaken hole.

293
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,697
You see<i>...</i> Mr Murphy<i>...</i>

294
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:54,286
<i>...</i>I am something of a fortune hunter.

295
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:02,211
And what fortune do you hunt
out here, Mr Lamb?

296
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:04,254
That would be my question
to you, Mr Murphy.

297
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:08,383
Unhand me, Murphy, or I'll slit
your fucking throat.

298
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:22,689
We are white men, sir.

299
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,069
Not beasts.

LAMB: Ah!

302
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:50,467
He sits up there
in those melancholy hills.

303
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:56,223
Some say he sleeps in caves
like a beast.

304
00:25:56,223 --> 00:26:00,227
Slumbers deep like the kraken.

305
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:04,565
The blacks say that he's a spirit.

306
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:07,568
The troopers will never catch him.

307
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:11,655
Common force
is meaningless, Mr Murphy,

308
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:17,202
as he squats up there
on his impregnable perch.

309
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:24,168
So I wait, Mr Murphy.

310
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:28,755
I wait<i>...</i> Arggh!

311
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:37,723
Aye, you wait.

312
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:39,766
You wait here, bounty hunter.

313
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:54,448

MAN 2: Hang him high, sir.

314

Hail the conquering hero.

315
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:29,983
What a vile specimen of humanity.

316
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,738
What a little piece of filth.

317
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,867
Not really the one that
we're looking for, though, is it, Captain?

318
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:41,161
In the end, justice will be done.

319
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,622
Mm. Justice.

320
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:47,125
Save your little wisdoms
for the mob, Stanley.

321
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,672
Has he told you where his brothers are?

322
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:53,924
With due respects, Mr Fletcher,

323
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:56,009
perhaps it would be wise
to allow police work

324
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,636
to be done by policemen.

325
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:00,305
Hmm.

326
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,478
What a little piece of filth.

327
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:12,901
Still, better than nothing, I suppose.

328
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,779

Good evening.

540

CHARLIE: There was a time
we both did.

542
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:45,204
Mikey deserves better.

543
00:45:45,204 --> 00:45:48,081
You were right to leave -
take him with you.

544
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:52,252

Martha.

564
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:26,221
When Sergeant Lawrence said<i>...</i>

565
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:30,684
<i>...</i>that the boy that you are holding
at the lock-up was man enough<i>...</i>

566
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:33,770
<i>...</i>what did he mean by that?

567
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:37,983
Sergeant Lawrence is an ignorant thug
with the moral fortitude of a snake.

What did he mean?

569

What did the boy do?

570
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:44,198
He's a member of the Burns gang.

571
00:47:44,198 --> 00:47:46,283
There are certain things
a woman should not be privy<i>...</i>

572
00:47:46,283 --> 00:47:47,951
I know that. I asked you a question.

573
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:49,828
I asked you not to visit me at work.

574
00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:51,538
Tell me what he did to Eliza.
Enough.

575
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:54,416
She was my friend!
Enough!

576
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:58,378
STANLEY: That's enough.

577
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,718
Headache, Captain Stanley?

578
00:48:12,142 --> 00:48:15,312
So, what can I do for you, Mr Fletcher?

579
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:26,740
Word has it that your men captured
half a dozen rebel blacks two days ago,

580
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,784
and that one was shot in the process.

581
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:33,580
Do you have a problem with that?

582
00:48:34,665 --> 00:48:36,708
Yes, Captain, I do.

583
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:39,169
Word came this morning
from Eight Mile Creek

584
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:41,839
that Dan O'Reilly's place was attacked.

585
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,423
Are you sure it was blacks?

586
00:48:43,423 --> 00:48:45,509
Dan O'Reilly had so many spears in him

587
00:48:45,509 --> 00:48:49,304
that he resembled your good old
garden variety English hedgehog.

588
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:52,474
It's simple, Captain.

589
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:55,227
It's called the law of reciprocity.

590
00:48:55,227 --> 00:48:59,356
Kill one of them and they're
going to kill one of ours.

591
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:04,236
Do the job I brought you
here to do, hmm?

592
00:49:04,236 --> 00:49:06,488
If you have to kill one,

593
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:08,782
make sure you bloody well kill them all.

594
00:49:09,908 --> 00:49:11,952
Well, I'll send some troopers out today.

595
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:19,835
Well, is our business here finished?

596
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:23,338
I'm going to have Mike Burns flogged.

597
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:25,424
What?
100 lashes.

598

Thank you, Martha.

605
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:08,217
Is there anything else I can get you?

606
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:10,802
No, thank you, Martha. This is lovely.

607
00:50:13,055 --> 00:50:16,558
Well, then, I'll leave
you two gentlemen alone.

your wife.

609
00:50:36,495 --> 00:50:38,747
You did well for yourself, Captain.

610
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:45,921
Word has it<i>...</i>

611
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:47,965
<i>...</i>that you had Charlie Burns.

612
00:50:49,758 --> 00:50:51,301
And you let him go.

613
00:50:52,386 --> 00:50:57,432
Word has it<i>...</i>that you offered him
some kind of deal.

614
00:50:57,432 --> 00:50:59,476
Tell me this isn't so, Captain.

615
00:51:00,602 --> 00:51:02,688
FLETCHER: Word has it
that you promised

616
00:51:02,688 --> 00:51:06,024
those animals who raped
Eliza Hopkins a pardon

617
00:51:06,024 --> 00:51:08,360
if Charlie Burns
brought back his brother.

618
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,738
A pardon for the annihilation
of the Hopkins family.

619
00:51:11,738 --> 00:51:14,825
Are you completely out of your mind?

620
00:51:14,825 --> 00:51:17,661
STANLEY: Listen to me.
Mike Burns is a simpleton.

621
00:51:17,661 --> 00:51:20,455
He spends all day in his cell,
crying like a child.

622
00:51:20,455 --> 00:51:23,292
It is my belief that he is
not responsible for his actions.

623
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:26,461
I'm not interested in
your beliefs, Captain Stanley.

624
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:28,630
Who do you think you are?
The judge and jury?

625
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:30,632
Arthur Burns must be stopped.

626
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:33,969
It is he who is responsible
for this outrage.

627
00:51:33,969 --> 00:51:38,015
And I know that Charlie Burns
will stop at nothing

628
00:51:38,015 --> 00:51:40,267
to protect his younger brother Mike.

629
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:44,646
So all we need do now is wait.

630
00:51:44,646 --> 00:51:46,857
FLETCHER: Wait?

631
00:51:46,857 --> 00:51:49,526
My God, man. They raped a woman.

632
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:52,321
Tomorrow morning,
I want Mike Burns flogged.

633
00:51:56,158 --> 00:51:58,327
As I said, 100 lashes.

634
00:51:58,327 --> 00:52:00,537
This will kill him.
So be it.

635
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:02,915
But what if I'm right?

636
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:07,377
What if Charlie Burns does as I ask?
What if he comes back?

637
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:09,671
Then we will hang the lot of them.

01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:44,299
<i>...</i>it's the strangest thing.

895
01:13:44,299 --> 01:13:48,428
I can still feel<i>...</i>
I can still feel the pressure

896
01:13:48,428 --> 01:13:50,472
of that dream baby's hand

897
01:13:50,472 --> 01:13:52,599
on my finger.

898
01:13:56,770 --> 01:13:58,856
What do you think of that?

899
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:11,869
(Both yell)

900
01:14:11,869 --> 01:14:15,205
That's the boy. Argh! Good boy.

901
01:14:15,205 --> 01:14:17,374
(Gasps)

902
01:14:17,374 --> 01:14:20,169
Nice and tight, eh? Right.

903
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:23,672
Up we get.
(Chokes and gurgles)

904
01:14:25,174 --> 01:14:27,759
Oh, no. I wouldn't try that if I were you.

905
01:14:27,759 --> 01:14:30,846
Ligatures and knots
are one of my many talents.

906
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:34,892
(Grunts and groans)

907
01:14:37,436 --> 01:14:40,105
And it appears
that you are singularly bereft

908
01:14:40,105 --> 01:14:43,358
in any talents whatsoever, Mr Burns.

909
01:14:43,358 --> 01:14:44,860
(Groans)

910
01:14:46,236 --> 01:14:48,030
To be speared by a savage.

911
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:51,283
How extraordinarily quaint.

912
01:14:53,202 --> 01:14:56,413
Easy, Mr Burns.

913
01:14:59,374 --> 01:15:01,293
I was drunk.

914
01:15:01,293 --> 01:15:03,504
You only got me because I was drunk.

915
01:15:03,504 --> 01:15:07,299
Well, I'm not drunk now.
I'm on the job now.

916
01:15:09,426 --> 01:15:11,011
Not a bad day's work either.

917
01:15:11,011 --> 01:15:16,350
What is an Irishman<i>...</i>
but a nigger turned inside out?

918
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:18,101
Now<i>...</i>
(Samuel roars through gag)

919
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:21,271
We're going to sit down<i>...</i>
(Muffled) Charlie!

921
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:26,777
Nice and easy, Mr Burns.

(Gasps for breath)

926
01:15:47,297 --> 01:15:49,842
I really should stop saving
your life, brother Charlie.

927
01:15:49,842 --> 01:15:52,052
(Muffled) Come on! Come on!

928
01:15:53,554 --> 01:15:55,097

01:16:33,802 --> 01:16:35,512
George Borrow, I believe.

939
01:16:37,055 --> 01:16:39,016
A worthy writer.

940
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:41,518
And a beautiful sentiment, sir.

941
01:16:41,518 --> 01:16:42,561
(Moans)

942
01:16:42,561 --> 01:16:44,605
But you're not my brother.

943
01:16:55,616 --> 01:16:57,618
Finish him.

944

(Quietly) Oh, dear.

945
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:08,629
This may hurt.

954
01:17:50,879 --> 01:17:52,422
When's Christmas, Charlie?

955
01:17:52,422 --> 01:17:54,591
I have some riding to do.

956
01:17:54,591 --> 01:17:56,176
Brother!

957
01:18:14,069 --> 01:18:15,612
Where did you get it?

958
01:18:15,612 --> 01:18:17,698
I'm a very resourceful woman.

959
01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:19,491
I never doubted it for a moment.

960
01:18:19,491 --> 01:18:21,076
TOBEY: Look real good, missus.

961
01:18:21,076 --> 01:18:23,245
Thank you, Tobey.

Ho, ho, ho.

966

TOBEY: Who is it?
MAN: Dr Bantrey.

969
01:19:10,584 --> 01:19:13,420
Are you alone?
Yes.

970
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:17,841
Then you may come in.

(Breathes heavily)

972
01:19:24,306 --> 01:19:28,852
It doesn't look good, Morris.
The boy is dying.

973
01:19:28,852 --> 01:19:32,231
Nothing I can<i>...</i>do.

974
01:19:36,109 --> 01:19:38,987
SAMUEL: Sure is pretty.
ARTHUR: Ah!

975
01:19:38,987 --> 01:19:40,989
You can never get your fill
of nature, Samuel.

976
01:19:40,989 --> 01:19:44,910
To be surrounded by it is to be stilled.
It<i>...</i> it salves the heart.

977
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:49,248
The mountains, the trees,
the endless plains.

978
01:19:49,248 --> 01:19:51,291
The moon, the myriad of stars.

979
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:54,294
Every man can be made
quiet and complete.

980
01:19:54,294 --> 01:19:57,923
Even the lowliest misanthrope
or the most wretched of sinners.

981
01:19:57,923 --> 01:20:00,801
What's a misanthrope, Arthur?

982
01:20:00,801 --> 01:20:03,303
Some bugger who fuckin' hates
every other bugger.

983
01:20:03,303 --> 01:20:05,472
Hey, I didn't ask you,
you black bastard.

984
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:07,015
He's right, Samuel.

985
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:08,934
A misanthrope
is one who hates humanity.

986
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:13,188
Is that what we are - misanthropes?

987
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:15,816
Good Lord, no. We're a family.

Prisoner coming through!

1002

Stand back, ladies and gentlemen,

'Tis the jailhouse for you!

You led us a merry bloody dance
for many days,

but alas for you,
you dirty mongrel, we've got you!

1009
01:22:52,139 --> 01:22:54,474
You're doing just fine, Sergeant Stoat.

SAMUEL: Keep moving,
you dusky devil. Don't lag.

1011
01:23:00,647 --> 01:23:03,901
And keep your lustful eyes
to the ground, you lecherous dog,

1012
01:23:03,901 --> 01:23:06,820
or I'll whip the filthy
black hide right off you!

1013
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:09,531
Good morning, miss.

(HAMMERING)

1015
01:23:30,385 --> 01:23:32,596
What's happening?
I don't know.
