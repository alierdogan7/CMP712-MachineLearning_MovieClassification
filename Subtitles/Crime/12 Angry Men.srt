[Man]
Thank you very much, sir.

00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,913
You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.

- [Men Laughing]
- Shh. Shh.

We did it, Pete. We did it.

11
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:32,175
[Perfunctorily] To continue, you've
listened to a long and complex case...

12
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,051
murder in the first degree.

13
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:39,098
A premeditated murder is the most serious
charge tried in our criminal courts.

14
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:40,933
You've listened to the testimony.

15
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,936
You've had the law read to you
and interpreted as it applies in this case.

16
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:48,024
It's now your duty to sit down and try
and separate the facts from the fancy.

17
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,487
One man is dead.
Another man's life is at stake.

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,283
If there's a reasonable doubt in your minds
as to the guilt of the accused...

19
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,285
a reasonable doubt...

20
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,163
then you must bring me
a verdict of not guilty.

21
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,123
Now if, however,
there's no reasonable doubt...

22
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:08,085
then you must in good conscience
find the accused guilty.

23
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:13,341
However you decide,
your verdict must be unanimous.

24
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,803
In the event
that you find the accused guilty...

25
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:20,223
the bench will not entertain
a recommendation for mercy.

26
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,518
The death sentence
is mandatory in this case.

27
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:27,313
You're faced with a grave responsibility.
Thank you, gentlemen.

I called the weather bureau this morning.

46

This is gonna be
the hottest day of the year.

47
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,073
Could be.

48
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,075
Boy, you'd think they'd at least
air-condition these places.

49
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,495
- What is your name, sir?
- Oh, it's, uh... That one, yeah.

50

Thank you very much.

00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,833
Okay, gentlemen, everybody's here.

52
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,752
Now, if there's anything you want,
I'll be right outside the door.

53

- Just knock.
- Okay, thanks. We will.

Good morning.

56
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,353
I never knew they locked the door.

57
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,605
Sure they lock the door.
What'd you think?

58
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,109
I don't know.
It just never occurred to me.

59
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,529
What's that for?

60
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,489
Oh, I thought we might want
to vote by ballot.

61
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,242

get him elected senator.

Yeah? I almost fell asleep.

67
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,341
I mean, I've never been
on a jury before.

68
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,136
No? I've sat on many juries.

69
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,223
What gets me is the way
those lawyers talk and talk and talk...

70
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,476
even when it's an open-and-shut case
like this one.

71
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,269
Did you ever hear
so much talk about nothin'?

72
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,229
Well, I guess they're entitled.

73
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,774
Yeah. They're entitled.
It's the system, but...

74
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:45,071
If you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids
down before they start any trouble.

75
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,239
It would save us a lot of time and money.

76

- Hey, let's get started, huh?
- That's a good idea.

77
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,577
[Man In Hat] Yeah, let's get goin', huh?
We probably all got things to do here.

78
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,705
I figured we'd start out with a five-minute break.
There's one gentleman in the bathroom.

79

- Mr. Foreman.
- Huh?

- Are, uh... Are we gonna sit in order?
- Gee, I don't know.

00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,524
I mean, it had a lot of interest for me.

No real... dead spots.
You know what I mean?

88
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,072
I tell you, we were lucky
to get a murder case.

[Man With Hat] Yeah. You can say that again.
And what about that business with the knife?

I mean, asking grown-up people
to believe that kind of jazz, huh?

101
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,058
Well, I expected that.
You know what we're dealing with.

00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,602
- Yeah, I guess so.

- What do you got, a cold?
- And how.

106
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,818
These hot-weather colds can kill you.

107
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,320
I can hardly touch my nose.
You know what I mean?

108
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,949
I sure do. I just got over one.

to see a paper this morning.

112

Hmm?

113
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,085
I was only wondering
how the market closed.

114
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,880
You got a seat on the Exchange?

pretty quick, huh?

122
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,653
I don't know about the rest of you, but I happen
to have tickets to that ball game tonight.

123

Yanks and Cleveland.

124
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,449
Yeah, we got this kid,
Modjelewski, in there.

125
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,201
Ooh, he's a real bull, this kid.

126
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,411
You know... Phoom!

127
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,747
A real jug handle. You know?

128
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,082
Phoom!

129
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,501
You're a real baseball fan, aren't you?
Huh? Yeah.

130
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,045
Where do we sit here?

131
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,215
Well, I thought we'd sit in order,
you know, by jury numbers.

132
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,717
One, two, three, four, five...
so on, around the table.

133
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,052
If that's okay with you gentlemen.

134
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,220
- Sure.
- What's the difference?

135
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,348
- I think it's reasonable to sit in order.
- Let it be.

136
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,683
- Number 12. Do I sit down here?
- Yeah. That's 12. We go around...

137
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,020
- We start with you. One, right?
- One, yeah. Two, three, four, five, six.

138
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,439
What was your impression
of the prosecuting attorney?

139
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,233
Okay. Two. You're two.

140
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,484
I beg pardon?

141
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,738
I thought he was really sharp, the way
he handled all those points one by one.

142
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,950
Logical sequence.
I was very impressed.

143
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:39,036
I think he... he did an expert job.

144
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,122
A lot of drive too, you know?
Real drive.

145
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,291
- Okay, fellas, can we hold it down a minute?
- Sure.

146
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,960
- Uh, fellas.

Say, we'd like to get started.
Gentleman at the window.

148
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,342
- We'd like to get started.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

149
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:57,096
Pretty tough to figure, isn't it?
Kid kills his father... bing, just like that.

150
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,765
Aw, listen, you analyze the figures,
you'll see it happens all the time.

151
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,767
They let those kids
run wild up there.

152
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,561
Well, maybe it serves 'em right.
You know what I mean?

153
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,230
Is... ls everyone here?

154
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,148
The old man is inside.

155
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,859
Oh. Would you, uh,
knock on the door for him?

156
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,903
You a Yankee fan?

157
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,530
No. Baltimore.

158
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,949
- Baltimore?
- Yeah.

159
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,786
That's like being hit in the head
with a crowbar once a day.

[Chuckles]

161
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,789
Who have they got?

162
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,292
No, I mean, who have they got
besides good groundskeepers?

163
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,918
[Foreman]
Say, uh, we'd like to get started.

164
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,046
Oh, forgive me, gentlemen.
I... I didn't mean to keep you waiting.

165
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,632
Baltimore?

166
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,510
Okay, gentlemen,
if I can have your attention.

167
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,555
You fellas can handle this thing
any way that you want to.

168
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,141
I'm, um... You know,
I'm not gonna make any rules.

169
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,519
Uh, we can, well, discuss it first
and, uh, then vote on it.

170
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,272
That's, of course, uh...
That's, uh, one way.

171
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,317
And, uh, well, we can
vote on it right now, and...

172
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,902
I think it's customary
to take a preliminary vote.

173
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,573
Yeah, let's... Let's vote. Who knows?
Maybe we all can get outta here, huh?

174
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,366
Uh-huh.

175
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,536
Okay, then I think that, uh...

176
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,497
Of course you know that we have
a first-degree murder charge here...

177
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,666
and if we vote the accused guilty...

178
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:11,003
uh, we've got to send him
to the chair.

179
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,840
- Um, that's mandatory.
- I think we know that.

180
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,675
- Let's see who's where.
- We might as well.

181
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,554
- Okay. Uh, anyone doesn't want to vote?
- All right with me.

182
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:26,352
Okay. Then, uh, just remember that this
has to be 12 to nothing either way.

183
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,895
Um, that's the law.

184
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,022
Okay, are we ready?

185
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,108
Now, all those voting guilty,
please raise your hands.

186
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,616
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

187
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,536
eight, nine, 10, 11.

188
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,539
Okay. That's 11 guilty.

189
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,124
Those voting not guilty.

190
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,378
One. Right.

191
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,755
That's 11 guilty. One not guilty.

192
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,257
Well, now we know where we are.

193
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:01,512
Boy, oh, boy. There's always one.
[Laughing]

194
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,348
So, what do we do now?

195
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,266
Well, I guess we talk.

196
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,684
Boy, oh, boy.

197
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,603
You really think he's innocent?

198
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,608
I don't know.

199
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,569
I mean, you sat in court with the rest of us.
You heard what we did.

200
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,780
The kid's a dangerous killer.
You could see it.

201
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,490
He's 18 years old.

202
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,659
Well, that's old enough. He...

203
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,412
He stabbed his own father
four inches into the chest.

204
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,747
They proved it
a dozen different ways in court.

205
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,375
Would you like me to list them for you?

206
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,751
No.

207
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,920
Then what do you want?

208
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,923
- I just want to talk.
- What's there to talk about?

209
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,341
Eleven men in here think he's guilty.

210
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,677
No one had to think about it twice
except you.

211
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,972
I want to ask you something.
Do you believe his story?

212
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,766
I don't know whether I believe it or not.
Maybe I don't.

213
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,435
So how come you vote not guilty?

214
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,437
Well, there were 11 votes for guilty.

215
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,273
It's not easy to raise my hand
and send a boy off to die...

216
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,442
without talking about it first.

217
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,944
- Well, now, who says it's easy?
- No one.

218
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,406
What, just because I voted fast?

219
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,908
I honestly think the guy's guilty.

220
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,786
You couldn't change my mind
if you talked for a hundred years.

221
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,872
I'm not trying to change your mind.
It's just that...

222
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,708
We're talking about somebody's life here.

223
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,877
We can't decide it in five minutes.
Supposing we're wrong.

224
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,378
"Supposing we're wrong."

225
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,464
Supposing this whole building
should fall down on my head.

226
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,549
- You can suppose anything.
- That's right.

227
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,135
Look, what's the difference
how long it takes?

228
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,804
Suppose we do it in five minutes.
So what?

229
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,015
Let's take an hour.

230
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,017
The ball game doesn't start till 8:00.

231
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,896
Hmm?

232
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,900
Who's got something to say?

233
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,401
I'm willing to sit for an hour.

234
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,196
Great. I heard
a pretty good story last night.

235
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,364
That's not why we're sitting here.

236
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,619
All right, then you tell me.
What are we sitting here for?

237
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,705
I don't know. Maybe no reason.

238
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:56,168
Look, this kid's been kicked around
all of his life...

239
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:00,172
you know, born in a slum,
mother dead since he was nine.

240
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,466
He lived for a year and a half
in an orphanage when his...

241
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,469
his father was serving a jail term
for forgery.

242
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,888
It's not a very happy beginning.

243
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,098
He's a... a wild, angry kid.

244
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,892
That's all he's ever been.
And you know why?

245
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,687
'Cause he's been hit on the head
by somebody once a day every day.

246
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,981
He's had a...
He's had a pretty miserable 18 years.

247
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,026
I... I just think we owe him a few words.
That's all.

248
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,655
I don't mind telling you this, mister.
We don't owe him a thing.

249
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,824
He got a fair trial, didn't he?
What do you think that trial cost?

250
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,994
- He's lucky he got it. You know what I mean?
- [Juror 7] You know it.

251
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,413
Now, look, we're all grown-ups in here.

252
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,374
We heard the facts, didn't we?

253
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,253
You're not gonna tell me that we're supposed
to believe this kid, knowing what he is.

254
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,713
Listen, I've lived among them
all my life.

255
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:45,133
You can't believe a word they say.
You know that.

256
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,052
I mean, they're born liars.

257
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,472
- Only an ignorant man can believe that.
- Now listen...

258
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,392
Do you think you were born
with a monopoly on the truth?

259
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,061
I think certain things should be
pointed out to this man.

260
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,230
[Juror 7] Come on. This isn't Sunday.
We don't need a sermon.

261
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,566
[Foreman] Come on.
We have a job to do. Now let's do it.

262
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,653
Rice Pops.
It's a product I work on at the agency.

263
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,115
"The breakfast with the built-in bounce."

264
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,825
- I wrote that line.
- Very catchy.

265
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,077
- Yeah.
- Say, do you mind?

266
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,870
Oh, I'm sorry.

267
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,415
I have this habit of doodling.
Keeps me thinking clearly.

268
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,208
Yeah, we have all this work to do.

269
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,002
- There's no point staying here forever.
- Sorry.

270
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:20,919
Okay. Um...

271
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,296
Okay. Um...

272
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,174
perhaps if the gentleman down there
who's disagreeing with us...

273
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,553
Well, perhaps you could tell us why.
You know, let us know what you're thinking.

274
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,014
And we might be able to show you
where you're mixed up.

275
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,765
Well, look, maybe...
Maybe this is an idea.

276
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,268
Now, I haven't given it much thought,
but it seems to me...

277
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:40,772
that it's up to the group of us to convince
this gentleman that he's wrong and we're right.

278
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,400
Now, maybe if we each took
a couple of minutes just to...

279
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,236
Well, it was just a quick idea.

280
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,779
No, no, no. That's a good one.

281
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,949
Uh, suppose we go
once around the table.

282
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,910
- I guess you're first.
- Oh.

283
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,329
Well, uh...

284
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,291
Well, it-it's hard to put into words.

285
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,336
I just think he's guilty.

286
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,921
I thought it was obvious
from the word "go."

287
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,506
I mean, nobody proved otherwise.

288
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,133
Nobody has to prove otherwise.

289
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,469
The burden of proof's on the prosecution.

290
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,013
The defendant doesn't even
have to open his mouth.

291
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,224
- That's in the Constitution.
- Oh, well, sure, I know that.

292
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,268
Uh, what I meant was, is...

293
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,064
Well, I just think he's guilty.

294
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,857
I-I mean, somebody saw him do it.

295
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:28,987
Okay. Uh, here's what I think,
and I have no personal feelings about this.

296
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,239
I just want to talk about facts.

297
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,368
- Number one.
- [Notebook Rustles]

298
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:39,039
The old man lived downstairs under the room
where the killing took place.

299
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,249
At 10 minutes after 12:00
on the night of the killing...

300
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:45,003
he heard loud noises,
said it sounded like a fight.

301
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,964
And he heard the kid yell out,
"I'm gonna kill ya."

302
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,342
A second later,
he heard a body hit the floor.

303
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,135
Ran to the door, opened it up...

304
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,638
saw the kid running down the stairs
and out of the house.

305
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,014
Called the police.

306
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,767
They came in, found the old man
with a knife in his chest.

307
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,104
The coroner fixed the time of death
around midnight.

308
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,273
Now these are facts.
You can't refute facts.

309
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,526
The kid is guilty.

310
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,611
I'm just as sentimental as the next fella.

311
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:13,573
I know he's only 18, but he's still
gotta pay for what he did.

312
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,117
[Juror 7]
I'm with you.

313
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,744
[Foreman]
Okay. Are you finished?

314
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,287
- Yeah.
- Right. Next.

315
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,582
It is obvious, to me anyway,
that the boy's entire story was flimsy.

316
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,876
He claimed he was at the movies
during the time of the killing...

317
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,504
and yet, one hour later, he couldn't
remember the names of the films he saw...

318
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,423
- or who played in them.
- [Juror 3] That's right.

319
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,800
And no one saw him going in
or out of the theater.

320
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,510
Listen, what about the woman
across the street?

321
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,887
If her testimony don't prove it,
nothing does.

322
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,306
That's right. She was the one
who actually saw the killing.

323
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,809
[Foreman] Now, fellas, please.
Let's go in order here, huh?

324
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,146
Just a minute. Here's a woman...
[Coughing]

325
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,690
Here's a woman who was lying in bed.
She can't sleep.

326
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,692
She's dying with the heat.
You know what I mean?

327
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,610
Anyway, she looks out the window...

328
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:54,281
and right across the street she sees
the kid stick the knife into his father.

329
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,242
[Deep Breath]
The time is 12:10 on the nose.

330
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,202
Everything fits.

331
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,121
Look, she's known the kid all his life.

332
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,331
His window is right opposite hers
across the el tracks...

333
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,083
and she swore she saw him do it.

334
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,836
- Through the windows of the passing el train.
- Right.

335
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,090
This el train had no passengers on it.
It was just being moved downtown.

336
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,093
The lights were out, remember?
And they proved in court that, at night...

337
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,596
you can look through the windows
of an el train when the lights are out...

338
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,015
and see what's happening
on the other side.

339
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,934
- They proved it.
- I'd like to ask you something.

340
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,687
You don't believe the boy's story.
How come you believe the woman's?

341
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,522
She's one of them too, isn't she?

342
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:32,194
You're a pretty smart fella, aren't you?

343
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,695
- Okay, gentlemen.
- Now, now.

344
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,989
- Now, gentlemen.
- Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

345
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,617
Oh, what's he so wise about?
I'm telling you.

346
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,953
[Foreman] Okay, now come on.
Now we're not gonna get anywhere fighting.

347
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,288
Whose turn is it next?

348
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,208
[Juror 12]
Oh, uh, his. Number five.

349
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,213
Okay, may I... Can I pass? it...

350
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,049
Well, uh, that's your privilege.

351
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,260
Uh, how about the next gentleman?

352
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,013
Oh. Well, uh, I don't know.

353
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:04,309
I started to be convinced, you know,
very early in the case.

354
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:09,022
You see, I was looking for a motive.
That's very important.

355
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:13,318
Because if you don't have a motive,
where's your case, right?

356
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,488
Anyway, that, uh, testimony
from those people...

357
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,616
in the apartment across the hall
from the kid's apartment...

358
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,952
that was very powerful.

359
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,830
Didn't they say something about a...
a fight and an argument...

360
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:29,334
between the old man and his son
around about, uh, 7:00 that night?

361
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,878
- I mean, I could be wrong, but I...
- It was 8:00.

362
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,005
It was 8:00. That's right.
They heard an argument.

363
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,841
They couldn't hear what it was about.

364
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,884
Then they heard
the father hit the boy twice.

365
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,929
- [Coughing]
- Finally they saw the boy run angrily out of the house.

366
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,597
What does that prove?

367
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:46,351
Well, it don't exactly prove anything.
It's just part of the picture.

368
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,354
Well, you said it provided a motive.
The prosecuting attorney said the same thing.

369
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,690
I don't think
that was a very strong motive.

370
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,360
This boy's been hit so many times in his
life that violence is practically a...

371
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,821
It's a normal state of affairs with him.

372
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:02,117
I just... I can't see two slaps in the face
provoking him into committing murder.

373
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,787
It may have been two too many.
Everyone has a breaking point.

374
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,417
[Foreman]
Anything else?

375
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,961
- No.
- Okay.

376
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,796
Uh, how about you?

377
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,592
I don't know. It's all been said.

378
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,762
You can talk here forever.
It's still the same thing.

379
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,933
This kid is five for 0.

380
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,894
Well, look at his record.

381
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,187
When he was 10,
he was in children's court.

382
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,064
He threw a rock at a teacher.

383
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,442
When he was 15, he was in reform school.

384
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,360
He stole a car.

385
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,946
He's been arrested for mugging.

386
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,032
He was picked up twice for knife fighting.

387
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,200
Oh, yeah, they say
he's real handy with a knife.

388
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,078
[Scoffs]
Oh, this is a very fine boy.

389
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,165
Ever since he was five years old,
his father beat him up regularly.

390
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,667
- He used his fists.
- Well, so would I.

391
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,252
A kid like that?
[Scoffs]

392
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:57,505
It's these kids, the way they are nowadays.

393
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:03,178
When I was a kid,
I used to call my father "sir."

394
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,221
That's right. "Sir."

395
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,265
Do you ever hear a kid
call his father that any more?

396
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,851
[Juror 8] Fathers don't seem to think
it's important any more.

397
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,687
- You got any kids?
- Three.

398
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,398
I got one.

399
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,652
Twenty-two years old.

400
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,696
[Murmurs]

401
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,535
When he was nine years old,
he ran away from a fight.

402
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,415
I saw it. I was so embarrassed
I almost threw up.

403
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:38,713
I said, "I'm gonna make a man out of you
if I have to break you in two trying."

404
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,134
Well, I made a man out of him.

405
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,304
When he was 16, we had a fight.

406
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,266
Hit me in the jaw.
He was a big kid.

407
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,772
Haven't seen him for two years.

408
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,985
[Scoffs]
Kids.

409
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,655
Work your heart out.

410
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,492
Well, let's get going.

411
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,911
[Juror 4]
I think we're missing the point here.

412
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,415
This boy, let's say he's the product
of a broken home and a filthy neighborhood.

413
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:17,085
We can't help that. We're here to decide
whether he's innocent or guilty...

414
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,088
not to go into the reasons
why he grew up the way he did.

415
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,882
He was born in a slum.
Slums are breeding grounds for criminals.

416
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,843
I know it, and so do you.

417
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:29,639
It's no secret children from slum backgrounds
are potential menaces to society.

418
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,891
- Now I think...
- Brother, you can say that again.

419
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,519
The kids who crawl out of these places
are real trash.

420
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,855
- I don't want any part of them. I'm telling you.
- Listen, mister. Listen.

421
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:40,650
- I, uh... I've lived in a slum all my life.
- Wait a minute.

422
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:44,154
Please, I... I played in backyards
that were filled with garbage.

423
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,281
I mean, maybe you can still
smell it on me.

424
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,699
[Juror 10]
Now, listen, sonny.

425
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,367
[Foreman] Come on now.
There's nothing personal about this.

426
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,995
- No, there was something personal.
- Aw, come on, fella. He didn't mean you.

427
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,164
Let's not be so sensitive.

428
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,082
This sensitivity I can understand.

429
00:22:56,167 --> 00:23:00,795
Okay, look, let's stop the arguing.
We're only wasting time, and...

430
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,090
Look, your turn down there.
Let's go.

431
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,261
Oh, I didn't expect a turn. I thought
you were all gonna try to convince me.

432
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,096
- Wasn't that the idea?
- Check. That was the idea.

433
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,390
- Oh, I forgot about that. He's right.
- What difference does it make?

434
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,809
He's the one who's keeping us in here.
Let's hear what he's got to say.

435
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,604
Oh, now wait a minute.
We decided to do this a certain way.

436
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,314
I think we ought to stick to that way.

437
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,399
Oh, stop being a kid, will you?

438
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,485
- What do you mean "a kid"?
- What do you think I mean?

439
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,195
K-I-D. Kid.

440
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:31,451
What? Listen, just because I'm trying
to keep this thing organized?

441
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,661
Here, you take it.
You take on the responsibility.

442
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,622
I'll just... I'll keep my mouth shut.
That's all.

443
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,707
What are you getting so hot about?
Calm down, will you?

444
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,125
Don't tell me to calm down.

445
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,336
Here. You wanna take the chair,
just take the chair. That's all.

446
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,880
- Did you ever see such a thing?
- See if you can keep it running.

447
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,924
- Listen, you think it's funny or something?
- Hey, forget it, fella.

448
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,592
The whole thing's unimportant.
Come on.

449
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,804
- Unimportant? Oh, here, you try it.
- No, nobody wants to change.

450
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,639
You're doing a beautiful job.
Sit down.

451
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,558
[Juror 7] Yeah, you're doing great.
Just great, fella.

452
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,519
You stay in there and pitch. You know?

453
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,688
All right. Let's hear from somebody.

454
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:06,277
[Juror 8] Well, if you want me to tell you
how I feel about it, it's all right with me.

455
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,488
Boy, I don't care what you do.

456
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,449
All right, I don't have anything brilliant.

457
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,660
I only know as much as you do.

458
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:17,497
According to the testimony,
the boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.

459
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:21,751
I sat there in court for six days
listening while the evidence built up.

460
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,087
Everybody sounded so positive, you know?

461
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,631
I-I began to get a peculiar feeling
about this trial.

462
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,800
I mean, nothing is that positive.

463
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,010
There are a lot of questions
I'd have liked to ask.

464
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,805
I don't know. Maybe they wouldn't
have meant anything, but...

465
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,849
I began to get the feeling
that the defense counsel...

466
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,434
wasn't conducting a thorough-enough
cross-examination.

467
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,896
I mean, he... he let too many things go by,
little things that...

468
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,732
What little things? Listen,
when these fellas don't ask questions...

469
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,318
it's because they know the answers already
and they figure they'll be hurt.

470
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:51,322
Maybe it's also possible for a lawyer
to be just plain stupid, isn't it?

471
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:52,699
I mean it's possible.

472
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,450
You sound like you met
my brother-in-law once.

473
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,953
[Chuckles, Coughs]

474
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,248
I... I kept putting myself
in the kid's place.

475
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,210
I'd have asked for another lawyer, I think.

476
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:06,838
I mean, if I was on trial for my life...

477
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:11,718
I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution
witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.

478
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:15,763
Look, there was one alleged eyewitness
to this killing.

479
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:19,684
Someone else claims he heard the killing,
saw the boy run out afterwards.

480
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,895
And there was a lot
of circumstantial evidence.

481
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:25,481
But actually, those two witnesses
were the entire case for the prosecution.

482
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,358
Supposing they're wrong.

483
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,235
What do you mean
supposing they're wrong?

484
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,196
What's the point
of having witnesses at all?

485
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,907
- Could they be wrong?
- What are you trying to say?

486
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,533
Those people sat on the stand under oath.

- Well, no, I don't think so.
- Do you know so?

490
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,584
Oh, come on.
Nobody can know a thing like that.

491
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,377
This isn't an exact science.

492
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:47,795
That's right. It isn't.

493
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,720
Okay, let... Let's get to the point.

494
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,389
What about the switch knife
they found in the old man's chest?

495
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,892
Uh, wait-wait a minute.
There's some people who haven't talked yet.

496
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,977
- Shouldn't we go in order?
- They'll get a chance to talk.

Be quiet a second, will you?

498
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,773
What about it, this...

499
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,318

admitted buying the night of the killing?

500
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,736
Let's talk about it.

501
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,072
All right, let's talk about it.
Let's get it in here and look at it.

502
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,907
I'd like to see it again.
Mr. Foreman?

503
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,077
[Juror 3] We all saw what it looks like.
Why do we have to see it again?

504
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,120
[Juror 4] The gentleman has a right
to see exhibits in evidence.

[Key Turns In Lock]

506
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,791
Say, could you bring us the knife?

507
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,668
- Knife?
- Yeah. Thank you.

508
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:31,589
The knife and the way it was bought
is pretty strong evidence, don't you think?

509
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,341
- I do.
- Good.

510
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,927
Now, suppose we take these facts
one at a time.

511
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,264
One. The boy admitted going out of the house
at 8:00 on the night of the murder...

512
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,266
after being slapped several times
by his father.

513
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,102
No, no. No, he didn't say "slapped."
He said "punched."

514
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,604
There's a difference
between a slap and a punch.

515
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:49,274
After being hit several times
by his father.

516
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,609
Two. He went directly
to a neighborhood junk shop...

517
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,820
- where he bought one of those...
- Switch knives.

518
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,905
Switchblade knives.

519
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,782
This wasn't what you'd call
an ordinary knife.

520
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,368
It had a very unusual carved handle
and blade.

521
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,953
The storekeeper who sold it to him...

522
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,164
said it was the only one of its kind
he had ever had in stock.

523
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:09,002
Three. He met some friends of his
in front of a tavern about 8:45.

524
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,586
Am I right so far?

525
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,797
- Yes, you are.
- You bet he is.

526
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,050
He talked with his friends for about
an hour, leaving them at 9:45.

527
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,095
During this time,
they saw the switch knife.

528
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,972
Four.

529
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,474
They identified the death weapon
in court...

530
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,060
as that very same knife.

531
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,938
Five. He arrived home at about 10:00.

532
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:31,357
Now this is where the stories
offered by the State and the boy...

533
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,359
begin to diverge slightly.

534
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,029
He claims that he went to a movie
at about 11:30...

535
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:40,158
returning home at 3:10 to find his
father dead and himself arrested.

536
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,285
He also claims that
the two detectives who arrested him...

537
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,662
threw him down a half a flight of stairs.

538
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,581
Now, what happened to the switch knife?

539
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,292
He claims that it fell through a hole
in his pocket on the way to the movies...

540
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:54,047
sometime between 11:30 and 3:10
and that he never saw it again.

541
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,090
Now there's a tale, gentlemen.

542
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,677
I think it's quite clear that the boy
never went to the movies that night.

543
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:01,721
No one in the house
saw him go out at 11:30.

544
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,306
No one at the theater identified him.

545
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,516
He couldn't even remember
the names of the pictures he saw.

- What actually happened is this.
- Thank you.

548
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:13,566
The boy stayed home,
had another fight with his father...

549
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,362
stabbed him to death and left the
house at 10 minutes after 12:00.

550
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,198
He even remembered to wipe the knife
clean of fingerprints.

551
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,909
Now are you trying to tell me
that this knife...

552
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,911
really fell through a hole
in the boy's pocket...

553
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,372
someone picked it up off the street,
went to the boy's house...

554
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,124
and stabbed his father with it
just to test its sharpness?

555
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,210
No. I'm just saying it's possible
the boy lost his knife...

556
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,504
and that somebody else stabbed his father
with a similar knife.

557
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:35,797
It's just possible.

558

Take a look at this knife.

00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,594
It's a very unusual knife.

560
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,221
I've never seen one like it.

561
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,099
Neither had the storekeeper
who sold it to the boy.

a pretty incredible coincidence?

I'm just saying a coincidence is possible.

564
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,147
And I say it's not possible.

Where did you get it?

569
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,579
I went out walking
for a couple of hours last night.

570
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,665
I walked through the boy's neighborhood.

571
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,751
I bought that at a little pawnshop
just two blocks from the boy's house.

572
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,294
It cost six dollars.

573
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:18,506
It's against the law
to buy or sell switchblade knives.

574

That's right. I broke the law.

Listen, you pulled a real bright trick.
Now, supposing you tell me what it proves.

Maybe there are 10 knives like that.

- Maybe there are.
- Well, what does it mean?

What's that, the discovery of the age or something?

579
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,773
You mean you're asking us to believe
that somebody else did the stabbing...

580
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,650
with exactly the same kind of knife?

581

00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,338
and you change your vote.

651
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,548
If that isn't the most sick...

652
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:33,302
Why don't you drop a quarter
in his collection box?

653
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:35,346
Oh, now just wait a minute.

654
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,014
- Listen, you can't talk to me like that.
- [Muttering]

655
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:38,933
- No. Who do you think you are?
- Calm down. Calm down.

656
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,352
No. Who does he think he is?
Did you hear him?

657
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,897
- It doesn't matter. He's very excitable. Sit down.
- Excitable? You bet I'm excitable!

658
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,817
We're trying to put a guilty man
in the chair where he belongs!

659
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,569
Someone starts telling us fairy tales,
and we're listenin'!

660
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,405
[Foreman]
Hey, uh, come on, huh?

661
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,407
What made you change your vote?

662
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,117
He didn't change his vote.

663
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,368
I did.

664
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,412
- [Juror 10] Oh, fine.
- [Juror 7] I knew it.

665
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,455
Would you like me to tell you why?

666
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,416
[Juror 7]
No, I wouldn't like you to tell me why.

667
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,043
I'd like to make it clear anyway,
if you don't mind.

668
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,628
Do we have to listen to this?

669
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,463
The man wants to talk.

670
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,132
Thank you.

671
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,552
This gentleman has been
standing alone against us.

672
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,887
Now, he doesn't say
the boy is not guilty.

673
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,931
He just isn't sure.

674
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,851
Well, it's not easy to stand alone
against the ridicule of others.

675
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:25,062
So he gambled for support,
and I gave it to him.

676
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:26,856
I respect his motives.

677
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,485
The boy on trial is probably guilty,
but, uh, I want to hear more.

678
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,362
Right now, the vote is 10 to two.

679
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:35,698
I'm talking here!
You have no right to leave this room!

680
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,658
He can't hear you. He never will.

681
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,326
Let's sit down.

682
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,708
[Juror 4]
Shall we continue?

683
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,002
Well, I... I think we ought
to take a break.

684
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:52,214
You know, one man's inside,
and I think we ought to wait for him.

685
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,259
- Okay.
- [Sighs]

686
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,094
Looks like we're really
hung up here, huh?

687
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,806
And that thing with the old man,
that was pretty unexpected.

688
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,352
I wish I could figure out some way
we could break it up.

689
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:11,942
You know, in advertising...
l told you I worked in an agency.

690
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,027
Mm-hmm.

691
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,112
Well, there's some pretty strange people
working there.

692
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:17,281
Well, they're not strange really, I guess.

693
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,992
It's just that they have peculiar ways
of expressing themselves.

694
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,327
You know what I mean.

695
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,621
Of course, I suppose it's the same
in your business too, huh?

696
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,873
What do you do?

697
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,125
- I'm a watchmaker.
- Oh, really?

698
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,420
Well, I imagine the finest watchmakers
in the world come from Europe, huh?

699
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:34,507
Anyway, as I was telling you, in an agency,
when we reach a point like this...

700
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:38,093
I'm telling him about, in an ad agency, when
a point like this is reached in a meeting...

701
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,805
there's always some character
ready with an idea, see.

702
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,848
[Laughing]
And it kills me.

703
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,433
It's the weirdest thing in the world...

704
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:47,853
the way they sometimes precede their idea
with a little phrase, see, like...

705
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:50,856
Some account exec will get up,
and he'll say, uh...

706
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,775
"Okay, here's an idea.

707
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:56,487
Let's, uh, run it up the flagpole
and see if anyone salutes it."

708
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,698
[Laughing]
I mean, it's idiotic, but it's funny, huh?

709
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:04,286
I, uh... I got a little
excited back there. I...

710
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,039
didn't mean to get nasty.

711
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:11,710
I'm glad you're not one of those
lets these emotional appeals influence him.

712
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,130
- Uh...
- [Chair Scrapes On Floor]

713
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:31,105
I don't know what's the matter with that fan.
Can't seem to get it to start.

714
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:35,025
# Be, be, be #

715
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,194
# Ba, ba, ba, ba, bum ##

716
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,697
[Clicks Tongue]
Eh!

717
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:43,033
Hey, you a salesman?

718
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,618
I'm an architect.

719
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,787
Hmm.

720
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,123
You know what the soft sell is?
[Blows]

721
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,961
Boy, you got it. Believe me.

722
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,339
I got a different technique.

723
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,925
Laughs, drinks, jokes.

724
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,261
Tricks. You know?
[Chuckles]

725
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,305
Yeah.

726
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,975
"Hit 'em where they live."
That's my motto.

727
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,146
I made 27 grand last year
sellin' marmalade.

728
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,482
That's not bad. I mean,
you know, considering marmalade.

729
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,487
Hey, what are you
gettin' outta this... kicks?

730
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,242
Or did somebody bump you on the head
one time and you haven't gotten over it?

731
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:27,036
[Laughs]
Maybe.

732
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,581
You know, you do-gooders are all alike.

733
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,334
You're always blowing your stacks
over some guy that fanned.

734
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,255
But what are you wasting our time for?

735
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:43,052
Why don't you donate five dollars to the
cause, and maybe it'll make you feel better.

736
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,599
This kid is guilty, pal.

737
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,101
It's as plain as the nose on your face.

738
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,437
So why don't we stop
wasting our time here?

739
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,440
We're gonna all get sore throats
if we keep it up, you know?

740
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,817
What difference does it make
if you get it here or at the ball game?

741
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,780
Oh, no difference, pal.
[Chuckles]

742
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,657
No difference at all.

743
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:07,993
## [Whistles]

744
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,462
Nice bunch of guys, huh?

745
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,839
Oh, they're about the same
as anyone else.

746
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,717
Phew! Boy, what a murderous day.

747
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,762
You think we'll be much longer?

748
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,472
I don't know.

749
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,474
Aw, he's guilty for sure.

750
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,101
Not a doubt in the whole world.

751
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,728
We should...
Should've been done already.

752
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,232
Oh, I don't mind, you know.

753
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,734
Hmm. Beats workin'.

754
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:45,572
Uh...

755
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,035
You think he's not guilty, huh?

756
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,954
I don't know. It's possible.

757
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:56,500
Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'
you never been wronger in your life.

758
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,003
You're wasting your time.
You ought to wrap it up.

759
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,255
Supposing you were the one
who was on trial.

760
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,966
Well, I'm not used to supposing.

761
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,554
I'm just a workingman.
My boss does the supposing. But...

762
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,139
Well, I'll try one.

763
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:17,021
Supposing you talk us all out of this, and,
uh, the kid really did knife his father. Huh?

764
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,239
Are you ready?

765
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,532
Hup.

766
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,533
That one.

767
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,285
Sorry, blue eyes.

768
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,370
- Well, where else...
- Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

769
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,622
- Well, where else...
- Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

770
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,624
Looks like we'll be here
for dinner, huh?

771
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,085
Okay, now let's...
Let's get down to business.

772
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,545
Now, who wants to start it off?

773
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,047
- I would.
- Okay, go.

774
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,215
You down there.

775
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,178
The old man who lived downstairs says he
heard the kid yell out, "I'm gonna kill ya."

776
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,889
A second later,
he heard the body hit the floor.

777
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:55,851
Now, he ran to the door and he saw the kid
running down the stairs and out of the house.

778
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,311
What does that mean to you?

779
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,048
I was wondering how
clearly the old man could

780
00:39:59,049 --> 00:40:00,773
have heard the boy's voice
through the ceiling.

781
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,900
He didn't hear it through the ceiling.
The window was open.

782
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,818
So was the one upstairs.
It was a hot night, remember?

783
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,236
Well, it was another apartment.

784
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,906
It's not that easy to identify a voice,
particularly a shouting voice.

785
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,574
- He identified it in court.
- [Juror 12] That's right.

786
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,117
And don't forget the lady
across the street.

787
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,995
She looked right in the open window
and saw the boy stab his father.

788
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,539
- Now, I mean, isn't that enough for you?
- No, it isn't.

789
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:19,583
Boy, how do you like this guy, huh?

790
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,502
It's like talking into a dead phone.

791
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,755
[Juror 4] She said she saw the killing through
the windows of a moving elevated train.

792
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,342
There were six cars on the train.
She saw the killing through the last two cars.

793
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,260
She remembered
the most insignificant details.

794
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,387
I don't see how you can argue with that.

795
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:37,017
Has anybody here any idea
how long it would take an el...

796
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,277
[Juror 3]
Hey!

797
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,862
This isn't a game.

798
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,410
- Did you see him?
- [Foreman] Hey.

799
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,246
- The nerve.
- All right, listen...

800
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:00,582
- The absolute nerve.
- Forget it. It's not important.

801
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,626
- "This isn't a game"?
- Calm down.

802
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,046
- Who does he think he is?
- I'm telling you, forget it now.

803
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:09,466
Has anybody any idea how long
it takes an elevated train...

804
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,385
going at medium speed
to pass a given point?

805
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,345
- What has that to do with anything?
- How long? Take a guess.

806
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,098
- I wouldn't have the slightest idea.
- What do you think?

807
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,058
I don't know. Maybe 10, 12 seconds?

808
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,727
I think that's a pretty good guess.
Anyone else?

809
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,605
- [Juror 11] That sounds right to me.
- Come on. What's the guessing game for?

810
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,524
- What do you say?
- Ten seconds is about right.

811
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,526
All right. Say 10 seconds.
What are you getting at?

812
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:32,656
This. It takes a six-car el train
10 seconds to pass a given point.

813
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,994
Now let's say the given point is the open window
of the room where the killing took place.

814
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:40,372
You can reach out of that window
and almost touch the el tracks, right?

815
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,957
Now let me ask you this.

816
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,293
Has anyone here
ever lived near the el tracks?

817
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:48,005
Well, uh, I just finished painting an
apartment that overlooked an el line.

818
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,756
- I was there for three days.
- What was it like?

819
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,008
- What do you mean?
- Noisy?

820
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,635
Oh, brother. Don't matter though.
We were all punchy.

821
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,305
I lived in a second-floor apartment
near the el line once.

822
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:59,433
When the window was open and the train
goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.

823
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:02,352
- You can hardly hear yourself think.
- [Juror 3] All right, you can't hear yourself think.

824
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,855
- Will you get to the point?
- I will. Now just a minute.

825
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,567
Let's take two pieces of testimony
and try to put them together.

826
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:12,738
First. The old man in the
apartment downstairs.

827
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,407
He says he heard the boy say
"I'm gonna kill you"...

828
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,243
and a split second later
heard a body hit the floor.

829
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:19,912
- One second later, right?
- [Juror 2] That's right.

830
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:26,001
Second. The woman across the street swore
positively she looked out of the window...

831
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,421
and saw the killing through the last two
cars of the passing elevated train, right?

832
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,840
- The last two cars.
- [Juror 3] What are you giving us here?

833
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:33,258
Now, just a minute.

834
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:37,763
We've agreed that it takes 10 seconds
for a train to pass a given point.

835
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,934
Since the woman saw the killing
through the last two cars...

836
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:46,980
we can assume that the body
hit the floor just as the train went by.

837
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:51,526
Therefore, the train had been roaring
by the old man's window...

838
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:55,113
a full 10 seconds
before the body hit the floor.

839
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,407
The old man,
according to his own testimony...

840
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:00,410
"I'm gonna kill you," body hitting
the floor a split second later...

841
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,955
would have had to hear the boy
make this statement...

842
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,915
with the el roaring past his nose.

843
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,541
It's not possible he could've heard it.

844
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,794
- That's idiotic. Of course he heard it.
- Do you think he could've heard it?

845
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:11,255
He said he yelled at the top of his voice.
That's good enough for me.

846
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,590
Even if he heard something, he still
couldn't have identified the voice.

847
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:14,800
With the el roaring by?

848
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:17,261
You're talking about a matter of seconds!
Nobody can be that accurate.

849
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:21,974
I think testimony that could put a boy into
the electric chair should be that accurate.

850
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:24,101
[Jurors Murmuring]

851
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,103
You know something?
I don't think he could've heard it.

852
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,522
Maybe he didn't hear it.
I mean, with all that el noise.

853
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,482
[Juror 3]
Oh, what are you people talking about?

854
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,609
[Juror 5] Well, it stands to reason
he couldn't have heard it.

855
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,611
Why should he lie?
What's he got to gain?

856
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,905
Attention maybe.

857
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,907
You keep coming in
with these bright sayings!

858
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:42,035
Why don't you send 'em in to a paper?
They pay three dollars apiece.

859
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,329
What are you talking to him
like that for?

860
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,709
Guy talks like that to an old man
really ought to get stepped on, you know?

861
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,627
You ought to have more respect, mister.

862
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,216
If you say stuff like that to him again,
I'm gonna lay you out.

863
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,146
Now you go ahead.
You... You say anything you like.

864
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:13,275
Why do you think
the old man might lie?

865
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,778
It was just that I looked at him
for a very long time.

866
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:20,657
The seams of his jacket was split,
under the shoulder.

867
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:22,326
Or did you notice that?

868
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,911
I mean, to come to court like that.

869
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,663
- Why...
- [Juror 10 Coughs]

870
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,668
He was a very old man
in a torn jacket.

871
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,629
And he walked very slowly
to the stand.

872
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:39,426
He was dragging his left leg
and trying to hide it...

873
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,178
because he was ashamed.

874
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,724
I think I know this man
better than anyone here.

875
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:52,022
This is a quiet, frightened,
insignificant old man who...

876
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,483
who has been nothing all his life...

877
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,985
who has never had recognition...

878
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,154
or his name in the newspapers.

879
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,032
Nobody knows him.

880
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,159
Nobody quotes him.

881
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:08,205
Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.

882
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,918
Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing...
to be nothing.

883
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:17,964
A man like this needs to be quoted,
to be listened to.

884
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,550
To be quoted just once.

885
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,511
Very important to him.

886
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:25,430
It would be so hard for him
to recede into the background...

887
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:27,224
- [Juror 7] Wait a minute.
- When there was a chance...

888
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:30,185
What are you trying to do...
tell us he'd lie just so he could be important once?

889
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,896
No. He wouldn't really lie.

890
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,441
But perhaps he made himself believe
he heard those words...

891
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,735
and recognized the boy's face.

892
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,113
That's the most fantastic story
I've ever heard.

893
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:44,241
How can you make up a thing like that?
What do you know about it?

894
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,335
Oh, uh, does anybody
want a cough drop?

895
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,671
- [Juror 12] No, thanks.
- [Juror 8] I'll take one.

896
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,156
[Juror 12] You can
say what you like.

897
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:01,258
I still don't see how anybody
can think he's not guilty.

898
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,844
There's something else
I'd like to talk about for a minute.

899
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,554
Thanks.

900
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:08,932
I think we've proved that the old man couldn't
have heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you."

901
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,600
- But supposing...
- You didn't prove it at all.

902
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:13,478
- What are you talking about?
- Supposing he really did hear it.

903
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:15,981
This phrase, how many times
have all of us used it?

904
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,566
Probably thousands.

905
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,276
"I could kill you for that, darling."

906
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,278
"Junior, you do that once more,
and I'm gonna kill you."

907
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:22,654
"Get in there, Rocky, and kill him."

908
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,614
We say it every day. That doesn't mean
we're really gonna kill anybody.

909
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,491
Wait a minute.
What are you trying to give us here?

910
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:30,287
The phrase was "I'm gonna kill you."
The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.

911
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,705
Don't tell me he didn't mean it.

912
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,082
Anybody says a thing like that
the way he said it, they mean it.

913
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:35,625
Well, gee, now I don't know.

914
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:40,422
I remember I was arguing with a guy I work
next to at the bank a couple weeks ago.

915
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,257
He called me an idiot, so I yelled at him.

916
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,302
Now listen! This guy's trying to make you
believe things that aren't so.

917
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,471
The kid said he was gonna kill him,
and he did kill him.

918
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,515
Let me ask you this. Do you really think the
boy would shout out a thing like that...

919
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,392
so the whole neighborhood could hear him?

920
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:54,311
I don't think so.
He's much too bright for that.

921
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:59,149
Bright? He's a common ignorant slob.
He don't even speak good English.

922
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,068
"He doesn't even speak good English."

923
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,325
Mr. Foreman, I'd like
to change my vote to not guilty.

924
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:09,826
You what?

925
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:12,329
- You heard me.
- [Foreman] Are you sure?

926
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,664
Yeah, I'm sure.

927
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,209
The vote is nine to three,
favor of guilty.

928
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,086
Well, if this isn't the living end. Huh?

929
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,885
What are you basing it on...
the stories this guy made up?

930
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,846
You ought to write for one of those
kooky detective magazines.

931
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,765
You'd make a fortune.

932
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,268
For crying out loud. The kid's own lawyer
knew he didn't stand a chance.

933
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,354
Right from the beginning,
his own lawyer knew it.

934
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,231
You could see it.

935
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:42,901
Boy, oh, boy. I'm tellin' you,
this guy here is really something.

936
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,529
Look, the kid had a lawyer, didn't he?

937
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:48,448
He presented his case, not you.
How come you got so much to say?

938
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:51,368
- Look, lawyers aren't infallible, you know.
- Baltimore, please. Huh?

939
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,161
He was court-appointed.

940
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:55,080
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It could mean a lot of things.

941
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:58,416
It could mean he didn't want the case,
or he resented being appointed.

942
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,335
It's the kind of case
that brings him nothing...

943
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,380
no money, no glory,
not even much chance of winning.

944
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:06,383
That's not a very promising situation
for a young lawyer.

945
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:09,386
He'd really have to believe in his client
to put up any kind of a good case...

946
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,471
and, as you pointed out a minute ago,
obviously he didn't.

947
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,391
Of course he didn't. Huh.

948
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:16,768
Who the heck could?

949
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,771
Except maybe
some guy's mother or somebody. I...

950
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,107
Ah, look.
Will you look at the time, huh?

951
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:24,734
- Come on. For crying out...
- Pardon me.

952
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,153
- I have made some notes here...
- Notes.

953
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:29,864
And I would like to...
please, to say something.

954
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,200
- Yeah.
- I have been listening very carefully.

955
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:36,705
And, uh, it seems to me that this man
has some very good points to make.

956
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:41,418
From what was presented at the trial,
the boy looks guilty on the surface.

957
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:45,589
- But maybe if we go deeper?
- Oh, come on, will ya?

958
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:47,966
There is a question I would like to ask.

959
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,344
Let us assume that the boy
really did commit the murder.

960
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:54,764
Now, this happened
at 10 minutes after 12:00.

961
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,309
Now, how was he caught by the police?

962
00:48:57,393 --> 00:49:01,896
He came back home, uh, at 3:00 or so...

963
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:05,734
and he was captured by two detectives
in the hallway of his house.

964
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:10,405
Now, my question is,
if he really had killed his father...

965
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,700
why would he come back home
three hours later?

966
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,661
Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?

967
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:18,496
He came home to get his knife.

968
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,124
It's not nice to go around leaving knives
sticking in people's chests.

969
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,960
- Yeah, especially relatives.
- Yeah. [Giggling]

970
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:26,296
[Juror 4]
I don't see anything funny about it.

971
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,924
The boy knew the knife could be identified
as the one he had just bought.

972
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:32,177
He had to get it before the police did.

973
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:36,723
But if he knew the knife could be identified,
why did he leave it there in the first place?

974
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:40,143
Well, I think we can assume
the boy ran out in a state of panic...

975
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,604
after having just killed his father.

976
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:45,649
When he finally calmed down,
he realized he had left his knife there.

977
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,652
Ah. This then depends
on your definition of panic.

978
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:51,112
He would have had to be
calm enough to see to it...

979
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,782
that there were no fingerprints
left on the knife.

980
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:57,911
Now, where did this panic start
and where did it end?

981
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,372
Look, you voted guilty.
What side are ya on?

982
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:04,000
I don't believe I have to be loyal
to one side or the other.

983
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,877
I'm simply asking questions.

984
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,963
Well, this is just off the top of my head,
but, uh...

985
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,549
well, if I were the boy
and I'd done the stabbing and everything...

986
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,760
I'd take a chance
and go back for the knife.

987
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,346
I'll bet he figured that nobody
had seen him running out...

988
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,932
and that the body wouldn't be discovered
till the next day.

989
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,059
Well, after all,
it was the middle of the night.

990
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,645
I'll bet he'd figured nobody
would find the body till the next day.

991
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,730
Pardon. This is my whole point.

992
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:29,526
The woman across the street testified that
the moment after she saw the killing...

993
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,195
that is, a moment
after the train went by...

994
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,281
she screamed
and then went to telephone the police.

995
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,743
Now, the boy certainly
must have heard the scream...

996
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:42,330
so he knew
that somebody saw something.

997
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:45,208
I just don't think
that he would have gone back.

998
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,044
Two things. One, in his state of panic,
he may not have heard the scream.

999
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:49,796
Perhaps it wasn't very loud.

1000
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,258
Two, if he did hear it, he may not
have connected it with his own act.

1001
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:56,386
Remember, he lived in a neighborhood
where screams were fairly commonplace.

1002
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,930
- There's your answer.
- Maybe.

1003
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,891
Maybe the boy did kill his father,
didn't hear the scream...

1004
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:05,687
did run out in a panic,
did calm down three hours later...

1005
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,398
and come back to get the knife,
risking being caught by the police.

1006
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,401
Maybe all of those things happened,
but maybe they didn't.

1007
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,237
I think there's enough doubt that we can
wonder whether he was there at all...

1008
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,989
during the time the killing took place.

1009
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,824
What do you mean doubt?
What are you talking about?

1010
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,617
Didn't the old man see him
running out of the house?

1011
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:21,494
He's twisting the facts, I'm telling you.

1012
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:24,914
Did or didn't the old man see the kid
running out of the house at 12:10?

1013
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,916
Well, did or didn't he?

1014
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:30,211
- He says he did.
- "Says he did"? Boy! How do you like that?

1015
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:33,256
- Now, look, witnesses can make mistakes.
- Sure, when you want them to, they do.

1016
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,592
Or when he wants them to, they do.
You know what I mean?

1017
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,510
- Keep the yelling down!
- Oh, you keep saying that.

1018
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,304
Maybe what we need
is a little yelling in here.

1019
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:41,097
These guys
keep going off every which way.

1020
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:43,099
Did hear the scream.
Didn't hear the scream.

1021
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:46,352
What difference does it make? You people
are talking only about the little details.

1022
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,938
You're forgetting the important stuff.
I mean, all of a sudden, everybody here...

1023
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:51,399
- I want to call for another vote.
- I'm talking here!

1024
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:55,153
There's another vote called for.
Now let's take our seats.

1025
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:01,576
I never saw so much time
spent on nothing.

1026
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,369
It only takes a second.

1027
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:07,874
[Foreman] Okay. I guess the fastest way
is to find out who's voting not guilty.

1028
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,710
Now, all those voting not guilty,
please raise your hands.

1029
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,548
Still the same.
One, two, three not guilty. Nine guilty.

1030
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,300
[Juror 7]
So, now where are we?

1031
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,804
I'm telling you, we can yackety-yack until
next Tuesday. Where's it all getting us?

1032
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:23,640
Pardon. I vote not guilty.

1033
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:26,726
- Oh!
- [Grumbling, Chattering]

1034
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:30,104
What are ya talking about? I mean,
we're all going crazy in here or something.

1035
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,983
The kid is guilty.
Why don't you listen to the facts?

1036
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:36,319
Tell him, will ya?
Now this is getting to be a joke.

1037
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,614
[Foreman] The vote is eight to four,
favor of guilty.

1038
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:43,368
What is this, love your underprivileged
brother week or something?

1039
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,954
I want you to get up and tell me
why you changed your vote.

1040
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:50,333
- Come on. Give me your reasons.
- I don't have to defend my decision to you.

1041
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,168
There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.

1042
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:55,255
What reasonable doubt? That's nothing but words.
Here, look at this.

1043
00:52:55,339 --> 00:53:00,260
The kid you just decided isn't guilty
was seen ramming this into his father.

1044
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,345
Now, what about this,
Mr. Reasonable Doubt?

1045
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,098
That's not the knife.
Don't you remember?

1046
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,350
Oh, brilliant.

1047
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,727
I'm telling ya, this is the craziest.

1048
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,980
I mean, what are we supposed to believe?

1049
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:14,899
I mean, you're sittin' here, you're pulling
stories out of thin air, you know?

1050
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:18,695
A guy like this, if he's, uh, sitting
ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight...

1051
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:21,239
he'd be trying to tell you that, uh...

1052
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,700
Look. Now, what about the old man?

1053
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,369
Are we supposed to believe that he
didn't get up and run to his door...

1054
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,455
and see the kid tearing down the steps
15 seconds after the killing?

1055
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,000
He's just saying so to be important, right?
[Chuckles]

1056
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:34,878
- I mean, what's the point of the whole thing?
- Wait. Hold it a second, will you?

1057
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,171
Oh, and the Baltimore rooter
is heard from again now...

1058
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:39,215
and pop-ups are fallin' for base hits
wherever we look.

1059
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,552
Hold it a second. Now, look...
Did the old man say he ran to the door?

1060
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:45,597
Ran, walked. What's the difference? He got on, didn't he?
I mean, he got there, didn't he?

1061
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:48,224
- No, now wait a second.
- He said he ran. At least I think he did.

1062
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:51,728
Look, I don't remember what he said, but I
don't see how he could have run to the door.

1063
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:54,188
He said he went
from his bedroom to the front door.

1064
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:55,899
- Now, isn't that enough?
- Where was the bedroom?

1065
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,234
- It was down the hall somewhere.
- I thought you remembered everything.

1066
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,570
- Don't you remember that?
- No.

1067
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,864
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to see
a diagram of the apartment.

1068
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:05,558
Why don't we just have 'em run the trial all
over again so you can get everything straight?

1069
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:06,200
Mr. Foreman.

1070
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,912
How come you're the only one in this room
wants to see exhibits all the time?

1071
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:11,706
- [Juror 5] I want to see this one too.
- And I'd like to stop wasting time.

1072
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,626
If we're gonna start wading through all that
nonsense about where the body was found...

1073
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,669
[Juror 8] We're not,
not unless somebody else wants to.

1074
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,463
But I'd like to find out if an old man...

1075
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:20,924
who drags one foot when he walks
'cause he had a stroke last year...

1076
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:23,426
can get from his bedroom
to his front door in 15 seconds.

1077
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,178
- He said 20 seconds.
- He said 15.

1078
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,430
He said 20 seconds.
What are you trying to distort...

1079
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,767
- [Juror 11] He said 15.
- How does he know how long 15 seconds is?

1080
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,518
You can't judge a thing like that.

1081
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,979
[Juror 9] He said 15 seconds.
He was very positive about it.

1082
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:37,273
He was an old man.
Half the time he was confused.

1083
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:39,651
How could he be positive about anything?

1084
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:51,454
I don't see what you're going to prove here.
The man said he saw the boy running out.

1085
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,706
Well, let's see
if the details bear him out.

1086
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,668
As soon as the body hit the floor,
he said he heard footsteps upstairs...

1087
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,419
running toward the front door...

1088
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:01,589
heard the upstairs door open,
the footsteps start down the stairs.

1089
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:03,800
He said he got to his own front door
as fast as he could...

1090
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,969
and he swore it couldn't have been
more than 15 seconds.

1091
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,720
Now, if the killer
began running immediately...

1092
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:10,014
- [Juror 12] Maybe he didn't.
- The old man said he did.

1093
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:12,809
You ought to be at Atlantic City
at that hairsplitters convention.

1094
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:14,018
[Laughing]

1095
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,229
Hey, why don't you stop makin'
smart remarks all the time, huh?

1096
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,440
My friend, for your three dollars a day,
you have to listen to everything, you know?

1097
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,234
Now that you've got that thing in here,
what about it?

1098
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,486
All right. Here's the apartment
where the killing took place.

1099
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,614
The old man's apartment
was directly beneath and exactly the same.

1100
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:29,909
Here are the el tracks, the bedroom,
living room, kitchen, bathroom.

1101
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:31,995
Here's the hall. Here are the stairs.

1102
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,330
Now, the old man
was in this bedroom right here.

1103
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:37,083
He says he crossed to the door
and walked down the hall...

1104
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,128
opened the front door just in time
to see the boy running down the stairs.

1105
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:43,548
- Am I right so far?
- [Juror 3] That's the story, for the 19th time.

1106
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:47,176
- Fifteen seconds after the body hit the floor.
- [Juror 11] Correct.

1107
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:49,303
Now, let's see. It was...

1108
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:53,391
It's 12 feet from the bed to the door.
The hall is 43 feet.

1109
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,686
He would have had to walk 12 feet,
open the bedroom door...

1110
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:00,398
walk 43 feet down and open the front door
all in 15 seconds.

1111
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,192
- Do you think he could have done it?
- [Juror 10] Sure he could have done it.

1112
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,862
He can walk only very slowly.
They had to help him into the witness chair.

1113
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:07,613
You make it sound like a long walk.

1114
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:10,033
For an old man who had a stroke,
it is a long walk.

1115
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:13,536
- Oh! What are you doing?
- I'm gonna try it, see how long it took him.

1116
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,011
What do you mean,
you want to try it?

1117
00:56:15,012 --> 00:56:16,998
Why didn't his lawyer bring
it up if it's so important?

1118
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,381
Maybe he just didn't
think about it, huh?

1119
00:56:18,382 --> 00:56:20,752
What do you mean, didn't think of it?
You think the man's an idiot or something?

1120
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,378
- It's an obvious thing.
- Did you think of it?

1121
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,130
Listen, smart guy.
Don't matter whether I thought of it.

1122
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,424
He didn't bring it up because he knew it would
hurt his case. What do you think of that?

1123
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,487
Maybe he didn't bring it
up because it would have

1124
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:30,386
meant bullying and badgering
a helpless old man.

1125
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:33,806
You know that doesn't sit very well with a jury.
Most lawyers avoid it if they can.

1126

- So, what kind of a bum is he then?
- That's what I've been asking, buddy.

1127
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:39,729
Pass me that chair, will you?
Those two chairs are the old man's bed.

1128
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:42,690
I just paced off 12 feet across the room.
This will be the bedroom door.

1129
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:45,401
Oh, that's crazy.
You can't recreate a thing like that.

1130
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,695
- [Juror 11] I'd like to see it.
- The hall was 43 feet.

1131
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,781
I'll pace from that wall and back again.

1132
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:54,911
Look, this is absolutely insane.
What are you wasting everybody's time in here for?

Will you stand right there
and mark the front door?

1140
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,848

to the testimony, remember?

1141
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,101
- Has anybody got a watch with a second hand?
- I have.

1142
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:20,603

That'll be the body falling.

I will.

The old man heard the fight between the boy
and his father a few hours earlier.

1156
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:17,493
Then when he's lying in bed, he heard the
body hit the floor in the boy's apartment...

1157
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:21,080
heard the woman scream from across the street,
got to his front door as fast as he could...

1158
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,749
heard somebody racing down the stairs
and assumed it was the boy.

1159
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:25,668

- Assumed?

[Laughing]
Oh.

1161

Brother, I've seen all kinds of dishonesty in

slum kids and injustice.

Suddenly you start getting through
to some of these old ladies.

Well, you're not getting through to me.

You all know he's guilty!
He's got to burn!

1169
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:53,404
You're letting him slip
through our fingers.

"Slip through our fingers"?
Are you his executioner?

I'm one of 'em!

1172
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:00,453

feel like to want to pull the switch.

Ever since you walked into

acting like a self-appointed
public avenger.

1177
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:15,051
You want to see this boy die because you
personally want it, not because of the facts.

00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:17,303
- You're a sadist.
- You...

Let me go!
I'll kill him. I'll kill him!

You don't really mean
you'll kill me, do you?

1181
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:33,361
Is there anything wrong, gentlemen?
I heard some noise.

1182

Oh, no. Everything's all right. We're just...
You know, friendly little argument. It's...

- "I beg pardon." What are you so polite about?

For the same reason you're not.

1192
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,332
That's not why we are here, to fight.

1193

that we are...

Notified.
That we are notified by mail...

to come down to this place
to decide on the guilt or innocence...

This is one of the reasons

It was right in the middle of a game.

1282
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:48,611
Uh, we were behind 7-6...

1283
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,280
but we just started to move the ball,
right off the tackle.

1284
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:54,158
Started cutting right...
slash here and slash right in...

1285
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:56,035
cut right through.

1286
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,621
And, uh...
[Chuckles]

1287
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:00,914
We had this kid Slattery, you know?

1288
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,461
A real... He was an ox.
You know, a real ox.

1289
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:08,047
I wish I had another one just like him.

1290
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:12,635
I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head
coach at the Andrew J. McCorkle High School.

1291
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,803
- Oh, yeah?
- That's out in Queens.

1292
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:17,640
And, uh, anyway...

1293
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:19,808
we're starting to move along real nice.

1294
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:23,062
Their whole line is just...
they're just coming apart.

1295
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:28,108
And it starts to come down
cats and dogs, just like this.

1296
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:30,819
Just whoosh... you know, right down.

1297
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:35,491
Well, that was murder, you know?

1298
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:38,160
I swear, I... I nearly bawled.

1299
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,579
You just... You couldn't go nowhere.

1300
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,165
Well.

1301
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:01,308
Hey, what is it with this fan here?
How come...

1302
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:10,818
Hey! Huh?

1303
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:14,196
[Laughs] Must have been
on the same switch with the lights.

1304
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:18,367
Well, things are looking up here, huh?
[Chuckles]

1305
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,536
Yeah, huh?

1306
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,376
Boy. That's better.

1307
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,548
[Crumpling Paper]

1308
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,551
Hey!

1309
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,302
Two points.

1310
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,308
Any of you guys ever go to the Garden?

1311
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:48,480
That's a damn stupid thing to do.

1312
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,733
Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh...

1313
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,152
You know?
[Chuckling]

1314
01:07:54,863 --> 01:07:56,363
Pardon me.

1315
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,783
Well, how do you like it?
Even Steven.

1316
01:07:59,868 --> 01:08:02,244
Pretty surprising, isn't it?

1317
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:03,829
Yes.

1318
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:09,126
Say, that business before,
when that tall guy... what's-his-name...

1319
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,920
was trying to bait me...
That doesn't prove anything.

1320
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,590
I'm a pretty excitable person.

1321
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:18,510
I mean, where does he come off calling me
a public avenger, sadist and everything?

1322
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:22,097
Anyone in his right mind
would blow his stack, huh?

1323
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:24,475
He was just trying to bait me.

1324
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,560
He did an excellent job.

1325
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,565
I'll tell you what I think.
We're going nowhere here.

1326
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,193
I'm ready to walk into court right now
and declare a hung jury.

1327
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:36,111
There's no point in this thing
going on any more.

1328
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:37,529
Yeah. I go for that too.

1329
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:40,449
Listen, let's take it in to the judge and let
the kid take his chances with 12 other guys.

1330
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,368
I don't think the judge will accept a hung jury.
We haven't been in here very long.

1331
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:45,120
Well, let's find out.

1332
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:46,914
I'm not in favor of that.

1333
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:50,209
Listen. This kid wouldn't stand a chance
with another jury, and you know it.

1334
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:53,128
Come on! We're hung. Nobody's gonna
change his vote. Let's take it inside.

1335
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:55,422
You still don't think there's room
for reasonable doubt?

1336
01:08:55,507 --> 01:08:56,799
No, I don't.

1337
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:58,175
Pardon.

1338
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:01,512
Maybe you don't fully understand
the term "reasonable doubt."

1339
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:04,139
What do you mean I don't understand?

1340
01:09:05,225 --> 01:09:07,184
Boy, how do ya like this guy?

1341
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,936
I'm tellin' ya, they're all alike.

1342
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,855
They come over here, running for their life,
and before they can take a deep breath...

1343
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:14,316
they're telling us how
to run the show, huh?

1344
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,193
Boy, the arrogance of this guy.

1345
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:20,864
[Foreman] Hey, all right. Let's stop
the arguing for about two minutes in here.

1346
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:23,325
Now, who's got something
constructive to say?

1347
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:26,954
I'd like to go over something,
if you gentlemen don't mind.

1348
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:29,706
An important point for the prosecution
was the fact...

1349
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:32,543
that after the boy claimed
he'd been at the movies...

1350
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,628
during the hours
that the killing took place...

1351
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:38,590
couldn't remember the names of the movies
or the stars who appeared in them.

1352
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:41,176
This gentleman here has put up that point
in here several times.

1353
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:42,719
That's correct.

1354
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:44,680
It was the only alibi the boy offered...

1355
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,266
and he himself couldn't back it up
with any details at all.

1356
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,602
Putting yourself in the boy's place,
do you think you could remember details...

1357
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:54,147
after an upsetting experience such as
being slapped in the face by your father?

1358
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:57,442
I think so, if there were
any special details to remember.

1359
01:09:57,527 --> 01:09:59,231
The boy couldn't remember
the names of the movies

1360
01:09:59,232 --> 01:10:00,696
he saw because be wasn't
there that night.

1361
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,823
According to
the police testimony in court...

1362
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:06,034
the boy was questioned by the detectives
in the kitchen of his apartment...

1363
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:09,037
while the body of his father
was lying on the floor in the bedroom.

1364
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,707
Do you think you could remember details
under those circumstances?

1365
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,792
- I do.
- Under great emotional stress?

1366
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:16,378
- Under great emotional stress.
- He remembered them correctly in court.

1367
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,422
He named the pictures
and the stars who played in them.

1368
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:21,675
Yes. His lawyer took great pains
to bring that out.

1369
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:24,303
He had three months from the night
of the murder to the day of the trial...

1370
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:26,013
in which to memorize them.

1371
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:28,765
It's not difficult for a lawyer to find out
what played at a particular theater...

1372
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,517
on a particular night.

1373
01:10:30,602 --> 01:10:34,229
I'll take the testimony of the policemen who
interrogated the boy right after the murder...

1374
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:36,732
when he couldn't remember
a thing about the movies...

1375
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:38,734
great emotional stress or not.

1376
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:42,112
- I'd like to ask you a personal question.
- Go ahead.

1377
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:45,449
- Where were you last night?
- I was home.

1378
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:48,076
- How about the night before that?
- [Juror 10] Come on! What is this?

1379
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:49,494
No, it's all right.

1380
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:52,122
I left the office at 8:30
and went straight home and to bed.

1381
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,874
And the night before that?

1382
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:56,376
That was, uh, Tuesday night?

1383
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:58,462
The night of the bridge tournament.
I played bridge.

1384
01:10:58,546 --> 01:10:59,880
Monday night?

1385
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:03,175
[Juror 7] When you get down
to New Year's Eve, 1954, let me know, huh?

1386
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,137
Monday night?

1387
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:11,391
Monday night, uh,
my wife and I went to the movies.

1388
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:13,101
- What did you see?
- The Scarlet Circle.

1389
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:16,438
- It was a clever whodunit.
- What was the second feature?

1390
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:19,149
The, um...

1391
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:21,902
I'll tell you in a minute. The, uh...

1392
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:26,156
Remarkable Mrs., uh, something...

1393
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,700
The...

1394
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:31,453
Mrs. Bainbridge.
The Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge.

1395
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:34,289
I saw that.
It's called The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.

1396
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:37,960
Uh, yes. The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.
I think that's right.

1397
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:40,545
Who wasin The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge?

1398
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:44,299
Barbara... Long, I think it was.

1399
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:46,385
A dark, very pretty girl.

1400
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,222
Ling or Long... something like that.

1401
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:53,517
- Who else?
- I'd never heard of them before.

1402
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:58,021
It was a very inexpensive second feature
with, uh, unknown...

1403
01:11:58,106 --> 01:12:01,233
And you weren't under
an emotional stress, were you?

1404
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,279
No.

1405
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:08,031
I wasn't.

1406
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,660
I think the point is made.

1407
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:14,496
Big point!
[Coughing]

1408
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,748
You can talk till your tongue
is draggin' on the floor.

1409
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:20,919
The boy is guilty, period.
You know what I mean, my friend?

1410
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:24,256
- Who's got those cough drops?
- They're all gone, my friend.

1411
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:28,510
Oh, boy. Look at that rain.

1412
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,971
There goes your ball game.

1413
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,473
It's only a shower.

1414
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:35,726
Besides, they got the infield covered.

1415
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:38,979
Right. Say, could I see that knife
a second, please?

1416
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:44,109
Well, we're still tied up six to six.

1417
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,194
Who's got a suggestion?

1418
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:48,280
It's five after 6:00.
Let's get some dinner.

1419
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,824
Why don't we wait till 7:00,
give it another hour, huh?

1420
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:53,035
Okay with me.

1421
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:55,287
Uh, there's something I'd like to say.

1422
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:58,915
I mean, it's been bothering me a little,
and as long as we're stuck.

1423
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,878
Well, there was this whole business
about the stab wound and how it was made...

1424
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,588
the downward angle of it, you know?

1425
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:06,673
Don't tell me we're gonna
start with that again.

1426
01:13:06,758 --> 01:13:08,383
They've been over it and over it.

1427
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:10,761
Well, I know they did,
but I don't go along with it.

1428
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:14,848
Now, the boy was 5 feet 7 inches tall.
His father was 6'2...

1429
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:17,100
That's a difference of seven inches.

1430
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:19,853
It's a very awkward thing to stab down
into the chest of someone...

1431
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,938
who's more than half a foot
taller than you are.

1432
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,149
Give me that.

1433
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:27,027
I'll give you a demonstration.
Somebody get up.

1434
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,322
You...

1435
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:37,537
I want you to watch this 'cause
I don't want to have to do it again.

1436
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:40,373
I'll make myself about six
or seven inches shorter, okay?

1437
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,585
- It's about right. Maybe a little more.
- Okay. A little more.

1438
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,804
- [Excited Chattering]
- [Juror 6] That's not funny.

1439
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:59,726
Now, nobody's hurt. Right?

1440
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:02,187
Right. Nobody hurt.

1441
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:10,445
Now, this is the way I'd stab a man
who was taller than I was.

1442
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:12,989
Look at the angle... down and in.

1443
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:15,158
And this is the way it was done.

1444
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:17,410
Now tell me I'm wrong.

1445
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:23,041
- Down and in. I guess there's no argument.
- Hold it a minute, will ya?

1446
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:24,960
Can you give me that?

1447
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,879
Boy, I hate these things.

1448
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,631
- Did you ever see a knife fight?
- No.

1449
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,299
- You?
- No.

1450
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,177
- Anybody here ever see a knife fight?
- [Murmuring]

1451
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:37,055
Well, I have.
You know, on my back stoop...

1452
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:39,474
the lot across the street, backyard.

1453
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:41,977
Switchblades came
with the neighborhood where I lived.

1454
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:45,313
It's funny I never thought of it before.
I guess you try to forget those things.

1455
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:48,775
- How do you use a switchblade?
- Well, you'd never use it like this.

1456
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:52,821
See, you use too much time
switching hands.

1457
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:57,075
Here's how... underhanded.

1458
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:02,831
Anyone who's ever used a switch knife
wouldn't handle it any other way.

1459
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:05,542
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

1460
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:07,460
That's why they're made to open like that.

1461
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:10,172
- You'd say the boy was pretty handy with a knife?
- Mm-hmm.

1462
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:13,425
You think he could have made
the kind of wound that killed his father?

1463
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:17,429
No. Not with the experience he'd had
all his life handling these things.

1464
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,514
I feel he'd have gone for him underhanded.

1465
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:22,642
How do you know? Were you
in the room when the father was killed?

1466
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,728
No. Neither was anybody else.

1467
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:28,023
So what are you giving us all this
mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.

1468
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:31,359
I don't think you can determine what type of
wound the boy might or might not have made...

1469
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:34,070
simply because he knew
how to handle a knife.

1470
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:36,489
What do you think?

1471
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:38,658
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

1472
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:40,577
I don't know.

1473
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,791
How about you?

1474
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:48,787
I don't know about the rest
of them, but I'm getting a

1475
01:15:48,788 --> 01:15:50,629
little tired of this
yackety-yackin' back and forth.

1476
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:54,174
It's gettin' us nowhere.
So I guess I'll have to break it up.

1477
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,801
I change my vote to not guilty.

1478
01:15:56,886 --> 01:16:00,222
- You what?
- You heard me. I've had enough.

1479
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,766
What do you mean you've had enough?
That's no answer!

1480
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:06,811
Hey, listen. You just take care
of yourself, huh? You know?

1481
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:10,857
He's right. That's not an answer.

1482
01:16:10,942 --> 01:16:13,902
What kind of a man are you?

1483
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:17,113
You have sat here and voted guilty
with everyone else...

1484
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:21,451
because there are some baseball tickets
burning a hole in your pocket.

1485
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:25,789
And now you've changed your vote because you
say you're sick of all the talking here?

1486
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:28,250
Now listen, buddy!

1487
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:33,004
Who tells you that you have the right
to play like this with a man's life?

1488
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:35,590
- Don't you care...
- Now wait a minute!

1489
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:39,678
- You can't talk like that to me!
- I can talk like that to you.

1490
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:41,638
If you want to vote not guilty...

1491
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:44,099
then do it because you are convinced
the man is not guilty...

1492
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:45,976
not because you've had enough.

1493
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,645
And if you think he is guilty,
then vote that way.

1494
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:51,940
Or don't you have the guts
to do what you think is right?

1495
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:54,276
- Now listen.
- Guilty or not guilty?

1496
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:58,655
- I told you, not guilty.
- Why?

1497
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:01,950
Look, I don't have to...

1498
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:05,161
You do have to! Say it! Why?

1499
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:07,706
All right. I don't, uh, think he's guilty.

1500
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:18,842
I want another vote.

1501
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:21,428
[Foreman]
Okay. There's another vote called for.

1502
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:24,389
I guess the quickest way is a show of hands.
Anyone object?

1503
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,392
Okay. All those voting not guilty,
raise your hands.

1504
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:33,481
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

1505
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:37,986
eight.

1506
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:44,034
Um, nine.

1507
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:50,040
Um, all those voting guilty,
raise your hands.

1508
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:52,500
One, two, three.

1509
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:55,086
Well, the vote's nine to three
in favor of acquittal.

1510
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:58,256
I don't understand you people!

1511
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:00,508
I mean, all these picky little points
you keep bringing up.

1512
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:03,928
They don't mean nothing!
You saw this kid just like I did.

1513
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:07,515
You're not gonna tell me you believe
that phony story about losing the knife...

1514
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,601
and that business
about being at the movies.

1515
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,687
Look, you know how these people lie.
It's born in them.

1516
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:14,814
I mean, what the heck.
I don't have to tell you.

1517
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,858
They don't know what the truth is.

1518
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:20,653
And let me tell you, they don't need
any real big reason to kill someone either.

1519
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,489
No, sir.

1520
01:18:22,573 --> 01:18:25,617
They get drunk!
Oh, they're real big drinkers, all of 'em.

1521
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,870
You know that.
And bang... someone's lying in the gutter.

1522
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,956
Well, nobody's blaming them for it.
That's the way they are, by nature.

1523
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:34,125
You know what I mean? Violent!

1524
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,710
Where are you going?

1525
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:38,797
Human life don't mean
as much to them as it does to us.

1526
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:42,801
Look! They're lushing it up
and fighting all the time...

1527
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:44,886
and if somebody gets killed,
so somebody gets killed!

1528
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,346
They don't care!

1529
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,640
Oh, sure, there's some good things
about 'em too.

1530
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,683
Look, I'm the first one to say that.

1531
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:54,062
I've known a couple who were okay, but
that's the exception, you know what I mean?

1532
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:57,899
Most of 'em, it's like they have no feelings.
They can do anything.

1533
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,568
What's going on here?

1534
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,695
I'm... I'm trying to tell ya...

1535
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,781
you're making a big mistake, you people.

1536
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:07,867
This kid is a liar!
I know it. I know all about them.

1537
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:11,746
Listen to me.
They're no good.

1538
01:19:11,831 --> 01:19:14,165
There's not a one of 'em who's any good.

1539
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,670
I mean, what...
What's happening in here?

1540
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,005
I'm speaking my piece, and you...

1541
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:23,883
Listen to me.

1542
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:26,428
I...

1543
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:28,972
We're... This kid on
trial here, his type...

1544
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:31,057
Well, don't you know about them?

1545
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:36,479
Th-There's... There's a danger here.

1546
01:19:36,564 --> 01:19:38,648
These people are dangerous.

1547
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:41,776
They're... wild.

1548
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:43,778
Listen to me.

1549
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:46,197
- Listen.
- I have.

1550
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:49,284
Now sit down
and don't open your mouth again.

1551
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:55,957
I was only trying to... tell you.

1552
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:36,748
It's always difficult to keep personal
prejudice out of a thing like this.

1553
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:41,878
Wherever you run into it,
prejudice always obscures the truth.

1554
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:45,840
I don't really know what the truth is.

1555
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:48,843
I don't suppose anybody
will ever really know.

1556
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:54,098
Nine of us now seem to feel
that the defendant is innocent.

1557
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:57,185
But we're just gambling on probabilities.

1558
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,229
We may be wrong.

1559
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:01,689
We may be trying to let
a guilty man go free.

1560
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,233
I don't know.

1561
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:05,318
Nobody really can.

1562
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:07,779
But we have a reasonable doubt...

1563
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:11,366
and that's something
that's very valuable in our system.

1564
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:15,995
No jury can declare a man guilty
unless it's sure.

1565
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:19,832
We nine can't understand...

1566
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:22,627
how you three are still so sure.

1567
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:25,463
- Maybe you can tell us.
- I'll try.

1568
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,343
You've made some excellent points, but I
still believe the boy is guilty of murder...

1569
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:32,136
and I have two reasons.

1570
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:35,348
One, the evidence
given by the woman across the street...

1571
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:38,059
who actually saw the murder committed.

1572
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,728
As far as I'm concerned,
that's the most important testimony.

1573
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:44,065
And two, the fact that she
described the stabbing by saying...

1574
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:49,779
she saw the boy raise his arm over his head
and stab down into the father's chest.

1575
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:51,906
She saw him do it the wrong way.

1576
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:53,908
That's absolutely right.

1577
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:56,578
Let's talk about this woman for a moment.

1578
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,747
She said she went to bed
about 11:00 that night.

1579
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:03,418
Her bed was next to the window,
and she could look out while lying down...

1580
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:07,589
and see directly into the boy's room
across the street.

1581
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:10,300
She tossed and turned for over an hour,
unable to sleep.

1582
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:14,554
Finally, she turned toward the window
at about 10 minutes after 12:00...

1583
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:19,767
and, as she looked out, she saw the killing
through the windows of a passing el train.

1584
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:22,562
She said the lights went out
immediately after the killing...

1585
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:27,442
but that she got a good look at the boy
in the act of stabbing his father.

1586
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:32,280
As far as I can see it,
this is unshakable testimony.

1587
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:35,700
- Well, that's the whole case.
- What do you think?

1588
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:42,749
How about you?

1589
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,836
I-I don't know.

1590
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,921
So much evidence to sift.

1591
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:50,965
This is a pretty complicated business.

1592
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:54,844
Frankly, I don't see
how you can vote for acquittal.

1593
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:57,263
It's not so easy to arrange
all the evidence in order.

1594
01:22:57,348 --> 01:22:59,390
[Juror 3] You can throw out
all the other evidence!

1595
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:03,061
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?

1596
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:05,021
- Yeah, well, maybe...
- Let's vote on it.

1597
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:07,273
[Foreman]
Okay. There's another vote called for.

1598
01:23:07,358 --> 01:23:09,192
Anybody object?

1599
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:12,320
All right. I'm changing my vote.
He's guilty.

1600
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:14,822
Anybody else?
The vote is eight to four.

1601
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:18,493
Why is this such a personal triumph
for you... this one vote?

1602
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:22,038
Okay. I say we're a hung jury.
I say we take it in to the judge.

1603
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:24,832
How about it?
I want to hear arguments.

1604
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:27,418
You, you're the leader of the cause.
What about it?

1605
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:31,506
Let's go over it again.

1606
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,508
We've been over it again!

1607
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:36,170
The boy in the gray flannel
suit here is bouncin'

1608
01:23:36,171 --> 01:23:38,388
backwards and forwards
like a tennis ball.

1609
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:42,308
No point in getting nasty
and trying to turn this into a contest.

1610
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:45,728
Okay.

1611
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:48,856
Maybe we can talk about
setting some kind of time limit.

1612
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,067
Yeah, once around for the deal, huh?

1613
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:55,530
It's a quarter after 6:00.

1614
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:57,573
Someone before mentioned 7:00.

1615
01:23:57,658 --> 01:24:00,034
I think that's a point at which
we might begin to discuss...

1616
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:03,371
the question of whether
we're a hung jury or not.

1617
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:05,123
Don't you feel well?

1618
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,418
I feel perfectly well, thank you.

1619
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:11,212
I was saying that 7:00
would be a reasonable time.

1620
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:14,215
Uh, the reason I asked about that
was because, uh...

1621
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:15,883
you were rubbing your nose like...

1622
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:18,636
Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting...

1623
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:21,931
but you made a gesture
that reminded me of something.

1624
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:24,058
I'm trying to settle something here.
Do you mind?

1625
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:26,144
Well, I think this is important.

1626
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:29,021
Thank you.

1627
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:31,733
Now then,
I'm sure you'll pardon me for this...

1628
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,736
but I was wondering why
you were rubbing your nose like that.

1629
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:36,487
[Juror 3]
Oh, come on, will ya?

1630
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:40,742
At this point, I happen to be talking
to the gentleman sitting next to you!

1631
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:44,078
Now, why were you rubbing
your nose like that?

1632
01:24:44,163 --> 01:24:48,249
Well, if it's any of your business, I was
rubbing it because it bothers me a little.

1633
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:49,959
Oh. I'm sorry.

1634
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:53,921
- Is it... ls it because of your eyeglasses?
- It is.

1635
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:55,757
Now can we get on to something else?

1636
01:24:55,841 --> 01:25:00,428
Your eyeglasses made those two
deep impressions on the sides of your nose.

1637
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,680
I hadn't noticed that before.

1638
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:06,267
- That must be annoying.
- It is very annoying.

1639
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,269
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

1640
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:11,689
I've never worn eyeglasses.
Twenty-twenty.

1641
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:14,317
Listen, will you come on already
with the optometrist bit?

1642
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:19,781
The woman who testified
that she saw the killing...

1643
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:23,409
had those same marks
on the sides of her nose.

1644
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:26,621
[Juror 6]
Holy smokes! You know, he's right.

1645
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,372
- [All Chattering]
- [Juror 9] Please.

1646
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:32,210
Just give me a minute,
and I'll be finished.

1647
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:35,129
I don't know if anyone else
noticed that about her.

1648
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:39,091
I didn't think of it then,
but I've been going over her face...

1649
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,261
in my mind.

1650
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:44,347
She had those same marks.

1651
01:25:45,349 --> 01:25:49,519
- She kept rubbing them in court.
- He's right. She did do that a lot.

1652
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:55,233
This woman was about, uh...
about 45 years old.

1653
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:59,278
She was making a tremendous effort
to look 35...

1654
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:01,572
for her first public appearance.

1655
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:04,909
Heavy makeup, dyed hair...

1656
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:08,871
brand-new clothes that should have
been worn by a younger woman.

1657
01:26:08,956 --> 01:26:10,623
No glasses.

1658
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,375
No, women do that.

1659
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:14,877
See if you can get the
mental picture of it.

1660
01:26:14,962 --> 01:26:16,796
What do you mean, no glasses?

1661
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,590
How do you know whether she wore glasses?
Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?

1662
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:21,884
Now, she had those marks. I saw 'em.

1663
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:23,886
So what?
What do ya think that means?

1664
01:26:23,971 --> 01:26:27,181
- Listen, I'm getting so sick of your yelling in here!
- Come on. Forget it.

1665
01:26:27,266 --> 01:26:30,268
Hey, listen. Listen, he's right.
I saw them too.

1666
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:33,479
I was the closest one to her. She had these, uh...
these things on the side of her nose.

1667
01:26:33,564 --> 01:26:36,774
- What do you call those on the side?
- Well, what point are you making here?

1668
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:40,736
She had dyed hair, marks on her nose.
Well, what does that mean?

1669
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:45,116
Could those marks be made
by anything other than eyeglasses?

1670
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:51,038
No, they couldn't.

1671
01:26:51,123 --> 01:26:53,124
[Juror 3]
I didn't see any marks!

1672
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:56,460
I did.

1673
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:59,088
Strange, but I didn't
think about it before.

1674
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:01,299
Well, what about the lawyer?
Why didn't he say something?

1675
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:04,302
There are 12 people in here
concentrating on this case.

1676
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:06,470
Eleven of us didn't think of it either.

1677
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:09,724
Well, what about the district attorney?
Do you think he'd pull a trick like that?

1678
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:11,684
Have her testify without her glasses?

1679
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:13,716
Did you ever see a woman who
had to wear glasses and

1680
01:27:13,717 --> 01:27:15,730
didn't want to because she
thinks they spoil her looks?

1681
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:19,317
Okay. She had marks on her nose.

1682
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:23,070
I'm giving you that.
From glasses, right?

1683
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:27,325
She didn't want to wear 'em out of the house
so people would think she's gorgeous.

1684
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:31,996
But when she saw this kid killing his
father, she was in the house alone.

1685
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,290
That's all.

1686
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:38,377
- Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?
- No, I don't.

1687
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:42,006
No one wears eyeglasses to bed.

1688
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:45,092
It's logical to assume that she wasn't
wearing them when she was in bed...

1689
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:46,928
tossing and turning, trying to fall asleep.

1690
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:49,347
- How do you know?
- I don't know! I'm guessing.

1691
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:51,891
I'm also guessing that she probably
didn't put her glasses on...

1692
01:27:51,975 --> 01:27:54,101
when she turned
to look casually out of the window.

1693
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:56,938
And she herself testified the killing
took place just as she looked out.

1694
01:27:57,022 --> 01:28:00,066
The lights went off a split second later.
She couldn't have had time to put them on then.

1695
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:01,776
- Wait a second.
- Here's another guess.

1696
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:05,947
Maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy
kill his father. I say she only saw a blur.

1697
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:09,617
How do you know what she saw?
How does he know all that?

1698
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:12,453
How do you know what kind of glasses she wore?
Maybe they were sunglasses.

1699
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:15,164
Maybe she was farsighted.
What do you know about it?

1700
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:18,501
I only know the woman's eyesight
is in question now.

1701
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:24,715
She had to be able to identify a person
60 feet away, at night, without glasses.

1702
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,176
You can't send someone off to die
on evidence like that.

1703
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:29,261
Oh, don't give me that.

1704
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:31,514
Don't you think the woman
might have made a mistake?

1705
01:28:31,598 --> 01:28:34,016
- No.
- It's not possible?

1706
01:28:34,101 --> 01:28:35,726
No, it's not possible.

1707
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:40,606
Is it possible?

1708
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:43,401
Not guilty.

1709
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:50,241
Do you think he's guilty?

1710
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:52,326
I think he's guilty.

1711
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,747
Do you?

1712
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:02,670
No. I'm convinced.

1713
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:04,338
Not guilty.

1714
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:06,215
What's the matter with you?

1715
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:08,217
I have a reasonable doubt now.

1716
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:09,844
Eleven to one.

1717
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:12,847
Well, what about all the other evidence?
What about all that stuff?

1718
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:15,016
The knife, the whole business!

1719
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,019
Well, you said we could throw out
all the other evidence.

1720
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:25,943
[Juror 7]
Well, what do we do now?

1721
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:30,614
You're alone.

1722
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:34,535
I don't care whether I'm alone or not!
It's my right.

1723
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,874
It's your right.

1724
01:29:49,009 --> 01:29:51,427
Well, what do you want?
I say he's guilty.

1725
01:29:53,055 --> 01:29:56,390
- We want to hear your arguments.
- I gave you my arguments.

1726
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,518
We're not convinced.

1727
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:02,396
We want to hear them again.

1728
01:30:02,481 --> 01:30:04,482
We have as much time as it takes.

1729
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:14,617
Everything... Every single thing
that took place in that courtroom...

1730
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:16,619
but I mean everything...
says he's guilty.

1731
01:30:16,703 --> 01:30:19,163
What do you think,
I'm an idiot or something?

1732
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:22,917
Why don't you take that stuff
about the old man?

1733
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:26,170
The old man who lived there
and heard everything.

1734
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:29,507
Or this business about the knife.

1735
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:31,592
What? 'Cause he found another one
exactly like it?

1736
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:35,012
The old man saw him
right there on the stairs!

1737
01:30:35,097 --> 01:30:37,932
What's the difference
how many seconds it was?

1738
01:30:39,101 --> 01:30:41,102
Every single thing.

1739
01:30:42,521 --> 01:30:45,689
The knife falling through
a hole in his pocket.

1740
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:49,110
You can't prove he didn't get to the door.

1741
01:30:49,194 --> 01:30:51,612
Sure, you can take all the time,
hobble around the room.

1742
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:54,281
But you can't prove it!

1743
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,829
And what about this business
of the el and the movies?

1744
01:30:59,913 --> 01:31:02,957
There's a phony deal
if I ever heard one.

1745
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:07,253
I'll bet ya $5,000
I'd remember the movies I saw.

1746
01:31:07,337 --> 01:31:09,588
I'm telling ya,
everything that's gone on...

1747
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:13,509
has been twisted and turned!

1748
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:15,678
This business with the glasses?

1749
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:21,308
How do you know she didn't have them on?
This woman testified in open court!

1750
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:25,354
And what about hearing the kid yell, huh?

1751
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:28,691
I'm telling ya, I've got
all the facts here.

1752
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:31,735
Here. Ah...

1753
01:31:34,114 --> 01:31:36,615
Well, that's it!
That's the whole case.

1754
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:45,416
Well?

1755
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,712
Say something!

1756
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:58,429
You lousy bunch of bleeding hearts.

1757
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:01,015
You're not gonna intimidate me.

1758
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:03,601
I'm entitled to my opinion.

1759
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:11,275
Rotten kids.
You work your life out!

1760
01:32:12,319 --> 01:32:13,736
[Muttering]

1761
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:18,073
I can't keep...

1762
01:32:22,746 --> 01:32:24,413
