00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:23,876
Mr. CHOI...

7
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:31,917
let's end this here.

8
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:38,292
No, it wasn't me...

9
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:44,167
Ja-sung, believe me! I'm not a rat!

10
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:49,126
Think about it, I served the chairman for ages,

11
00:01:49,126 --> 00:01:53,917
why would I betray him and snitch for the feds?

12
00:01:55,084 --> 00:01:56,542
Ja-sung!

13
00:01:56,626 --> 00:02:00,167
Gonna be a rat till the end?

14
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:05,209
Ja-sung, please...

15
00:02:07,084 --> 00:02:08,417
Please!

16
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:12,001
Please!

17
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,292
It's done, boss.

18
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,167
Let's go.

19
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:58,126

27
00:03:46,501 --> 00:03:51,917
The prosecution has dropped charges of
embezzlement, stock price manipulation,

28
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:54,876
and tax evasion against Goldmoon's chairman SEOK...

29
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:59,876
This non-indictment concludes
a year-long investigation.

30
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:04,209
The prosecution justified
their decision based on information

31
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:09,501
provided by SEOK and due
to lack of sufficient evidence.

32
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:14,501
The police, on the other hand,
are outraged by this outcome,

33
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:20,167
and accused the prosecution of being too lenient
to a high profile felon.

34
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:24,751
In other news, car ferries will connect
Incheon and Shanghai...

The Incheon Port Authority has issued Goldmoon

36
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:35,167
a marine passenger transportation permit...

37
00:06:03,834 --> 00:06:05,167
And the Shanghai boss?

38
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,334
He'll arrive on tomorrow's first flight.

39
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:21,792
The fuck? You boys came to greet?

40
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:24,709
Mr. LEE himself came out to greet me!

41
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,292
Come on, let's just go.

42
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:31,834
Yo bro, what's with the sour face?
I've been gone for a long time.

43
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:35,167
You left a few days ago,
we don't have time for this shit.

44
00:06:35,334 --> 00:06:38,876
At least pretend you're happy to see me!

45
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:41,584
Suk-mu, come here, shitbag,

46
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:44,709
take a hit for your boss.

47
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:48,917
Get me a bouquet of red roses, motherfucker.

48
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:53,751
You're no fun! Come on, wait for me.

49
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:55,751
Yo bro!

50
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:57,751
Fucking asshole!

51
00:06:58,542 --> 00:06:59,542
Let's go.

52
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:10,001
This is the newest model.

53
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:13,917
I sold my left ball to buy this bad boy.

54
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:18,042
How is it? Do I look like a celeb?

55
00:07:20,334 --> 00:07:22,792
Cricket chirping...

56
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:28,126
How's the old man?

57
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:33,417
It might be today or tomorrow,
the doctors can't say for sure.

58
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:37,876
Goddammit, at least he'll die happy.

59
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:41,459
Why did he have to get his dick wet at that hour?

60
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:47,001
He got what he deserved
for never sharing his Viagra.

61
00:07:50,876 --> 00:07:55,376
I doubt someone put a hit on him.

62
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,834
Very nice.

63
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:10,334
Brand name really adds class, I can't see shit!

64
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:13,667
Wait a minute!

65
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:16,292
Where's the bag?

66
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:18,251
Here it is.

67
00:08:18,251 --> 00:08:21,417
Here, a present.

68
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,001
What is it?

69
00:08:25,376 --> 00:08:28,959
I picked it up when I bought mine, for your wife.

70
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:31,709
In exchange for a healthy baby.

71
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:37,167
- Knock-offs again?
- What? You ungrateful...

72
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:40,209
I got certificate of authenticity!

73
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:43,751
Forget it, give it to your wife.

74
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:46,667
Please stop buying shit like this!

75
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:53,876
So obvious?

76
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:58,167
This one too?

77
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:02,251
Not as much.

78
00:09:06,251 --> 00:09:10,209
You motherfucker! He says it's obvious!

79
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:15,042
You said it looked legit! You lying sack of shit!

80
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:17,459
You should've looked carefully!

81
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:21,334
He's your junior, right? Punch him, now!

82
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:24,292
Come on, slap him!

83
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,001
Harder! Harder, motherfucker!

84
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:30,334
I'm sorry!

85
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:13,042
Mr. SEOK was pronounced dead...

86
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:13,834
What?!

87
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:18,542
Who's dead?!

88
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,042
- Say what?!
- Boss!

89
00:10:20,042 --> 00:10:21,334
- Boss!
- Who's dead?!

90
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,876
- Please calm down.
- Let go of me!

91
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:27,501
If you were paid that much, bring him back to life!

92
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,584
- Please stop, sir!
- Let go of me!

93
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:33,876
Where's the hospital chief? Get him down here!

94
00:10:40,876 --> 00:10:43,209
Goldmoon Corruption Investigation Report

95
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:59,292
I cross-referenced both data.

96
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,584
Yes, they're the same.

97
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:01,251
Thank you for coming, thank you.

98
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,792
Thank you, this way please.

99
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:23,042
God fucking damn!

100
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:27,001
Don't those fucks know when to lay off?

101
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:44,001
Look how many cars there are.

102
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:45,126
It's too hot.

103
00:12:47,251 --> 00:12:49,042
What the fuck?!

104
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,376
Look at these guys.

105
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:56,917
Who gave you permission to take our photos?

106
00:12:58,251 --> 00:13:00,584
You're violating our privacy.

107
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:08,751
Not here to pay your respect,
so who do you work for?

108
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:12,584
Speak up, cat got your tongue?

109
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,667
- Boys.
- Yes, boss.

110
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:16,959
Get their mugshots.

111
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:19,792
We might bump into them later.

112
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:20,751
Yes, boss!

113
00:13:20,751 --> 00:13:21,917
Get your cameras out.

114
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,709
Smile for the camera, bitches!

115
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:26,959
Why exactly are you hounding us?

116
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:31,167
You're stalking us? You sons of bitches.

117
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:33,959
I'll stalk your bitch, son.

118
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:39,084
You think you're so famous and shit?

119
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:43,042
We're checking up on our favorite hooligans.

120
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:46,834
This is all busted, what do you say to that?

121
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,501
So lieutenant KANG is behind it all?

122
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:53,126
Our last go-around wasn't painful enough?

123
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:57,334
So what brought you here with your minions?

124
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:03,959
Are you fucking deaf?
I told you we're here to work,

125
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:06,251
checking up on criminals.

126
00:14:06,251 --> 00:14:10,292
Don't worry about us, go bury the old man.

127
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:11,584
Goddammit.

128
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:14,417
How can we, when you're being so blatant?

129
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:15,501
I'm not blind.

130
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:18,667
Should I make you then?

131
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:27,376
Your foul mouth hasn't changed one bit.

132
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:29,126
But you better watch out.

133
00:14:29,584 --> 00:14:33,251
It may lead to your unfortunate demise.

134
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,417
- Wanna bet?
- What?

135
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:42,251
Whose head will roll first, yours or mine.

136
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:44,709
What the fuck?!

137
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,376
Idiots.

138
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:53,542
There's plenty of space
beside the old man's grave.

139
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:56,126
Stupid pricks.

140
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:59,001
And this is the latest model.

141
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:03,584
Ink on the receipt isn't even dry yet.

142
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:19,501
Buy yourself some smokes with the change.

143
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:28,709
Oh yeah, I got a promotion!

144
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,876
I'm a section chief now. Don't forget!

145
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:33,751
Fucking cops...

146
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:39,542
Since we're all acquainted,
fetch us some food while at it.

147
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:43,084
I saw steaks heading in there.

148
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:45,084
Is it certified Korean beef?

149
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,876
You fucking idiots.

150
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:58,542
I want a written apology for this.

151
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,126
Yes, sir.

152
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:08,876
This is SEOK Dong-chool

153
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:11,001
As the chairman of Goldmoon,

154
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:14,792
he transformed the Jaebum gang
into a national crime syndicate.

155
00:16:15,376 --> 00:16:21,292
He died in a car crash 2 weeks ago
on his way back from his mistress.

156
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:24,209
I heard, so?

157
00:16:24,376 --> 00:16:29,876
Because of his sudden death,
his seat remains vacant.

158
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:36,084
As you know, Goldmoon is
an amalgamation of the Jaebum,

159
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:40,001
Jeil and Northmoon gangs,
the largest syndicate in Korea.

160
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:45,001
They pushed into an enterprise model,
and now owns 8 subsidiaries,

161
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:47,126
growing into a mid-size corporation.

162
00:16:47,126 --> 00:16:52,584
We may never be able to contain them ever again,

163
00:16:52,584 --> 00:16:54,834
if we do not take action now.

164
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:55,626
To the point.

165
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,001
We'll influence their succession plan.

166
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:06,667
Who are the candidates?

167
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:11,251
JUNG Chung, Goldmoon executive director.

168
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:17,001
He's in charge of construction,
and has close ties with the triads.

169
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:21,084
He's a Chinese descendant,
and former head of Northmoon,

170
00:17:21,251 --> 00:17:24,959
until he joined forces with Jaebum's SEOK.

171
00:17:25,584 --> 00:17:28,209
Since he handles Goldmoon's main business,

172
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:33,959
he's the heir apparent even though
officially he's third in line.

173
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:36,542
- Opposition?
- LEE Joong-go.

174
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:40,001
Goldmoon's managing director and 4th in line.

175
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:44,001
He handles private loans, pyramids
and entertainment businesses,

176
00:17:44,292 --> 00:17:49,709
he was Jaebum's #2 under SEOK,
but JUNG Chung pushed him down.

177
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:52,251
So they're in constant conflict.

178
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:57,459
Still, he's backed by Jaebum clan,
which holds the most power.

179
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:02,834
So it's between these two?

180
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:08,084
Officially, #2 spot is held by JANG Su-ki,

181
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:13,876
but it's strictly a formality
and he's not involved in day-to-day.

182
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:18,001
Can this be done?

183
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:20,667
What if it fails?

184
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:28,001
It'll only cost their lives.

185
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,126
Watch what you're saying!

186
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:40,917
Alright, you have my blessing.

187
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:45,667
- But keep me in the dark.
- Of course, sir.

188
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,292
What's the operation code name?

189
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:55,167
New World, sir.Operation New World.

190
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:02,709
Dammit, there's nowhere to go.

191
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:06,667
You haven't improved much in 6 years.

192
00:19:07,084 --> 00:19:10,626
You know me, I hate headaches.

193
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:18,292
At least try to make the most of it.

194
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:19,084
For what?

195
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:22,042
All this will be over soon.

196
00:19:24,292 --> 00:19:28,292
There's a succession board meeting in 2 days,

197
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,667
all the regional bosses will attend it.

198
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:35,376
Their profiles are in the report.

199
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:38,417
Okay, I'll check.

200
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:42,001
By the way, this won't...

201
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:48,917
affect me or change our deal, right?

202
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,834
Actually,

203
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:55,042
got a new order for you today.

204
00:20:47,751 --> 00:20:49,542
Have you lost it?

205
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,501
You got a handler for a reason.

206
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:57,501
Why don't you go around waving your badge?

207
00:20:57,751 --> 00:21:01,417
What is it this time? What the hell's going on?

208
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:06,584
You said I'm done when SEOK's taken care of!

209
00:21:06,584 --> 00:21:09,042
- The situation's changed...
- 'Changed'?!

210
00:21:11,001 --> 00:21:15,584
Is it my fault he wasn't prosecuted?
Or that he's dead?

211
00:21:16,334 --> 00:21:17,917
Whose idea was this?

212
00:21:18,584 --> 00:21:21,084
Which fat head came up with it?

213
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:25,167
There's only 3 people in the world
who know about you.

214
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:27,751
Was it you or director KO?

215
00:21:28,584 --> 00:21:30,667
You insolent fuck,

216
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:33,626
watch your tone!

217
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:39,001
After posing to be a gangster for 10 years,

218
00:21:39,334 --> 00:21:41,417
you sound like the real thing.

219
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:48,959
I can't do this anymore,

220
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:51,667
keep your word.

221
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:54,167
Yeah?

222
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:57,001
That's right.

223
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:01,667
Fine, then don't.

224
00:22:02,251 --> 00:22:04,417
And just quit.

225
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:08,626
You're good at being a gangster.

226
00:22:09,334 --> 00:22:13,626
Give up the law and be a gangster for real.

227
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:18,251
Isn't that a better life for you?

228
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:22,751
Cop salary is rat shit.

229
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:27,376
What's your income now? A fortune, right?

230
00:22:27,376 --> 00:22:29,417
- Are your serious?
- Wait a minute.

231
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:36,917
What'd they do to you
if they found out you're a cop?

232
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:44,542
Is this fun to you? Are you fucking with me?

233
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:51,459
Look at you, you're a bonafide gangster.

234
00:22:54,376 --> 00:22:55,459
Let go.

235
00:23:07,126 --> 00:23:08,792
Ungrateful prick.

236
00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:24,292
Look at the positive side of this,

237
00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:26,792
it'll only take a few weeks.

238
00:23:27,626 --> 00:23:30,501
You did this for 8 years, this is nothing.

239
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:34,292
Until the successor is decided.

240
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:41,876
Continue supporting your boy JUNG,
it's no big deal.

241
00:23:42,876 --> 00:23:47,959
And I'll get you the promised
overseas reassignment.

242
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:53,334
This special op will double your pay.

243
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:56,459
You'll practically be a made man.

244
00:23:58,126 --> 00:23:59,459
Take this with you.

245
00:24:03,251 --> 00:24:06,667
I picked out a mobile and some toys.

246
00:24:07,501 --> 00:24:08,334
I heard it's a son.

247
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:18,042
How did you know that?

248
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,709
You got a tail on me?

249
00:24:23,126 --> 00:24:27,667
Don't get paranoid,
we're just protecting our asset.

250
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:32,667
You're our most prized investment.

251
00:24:55,334 --> 00:24:56,834
Shit...

252
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:12,667
It's not safe to delay appointing the successor.

253
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:18,251
We'd prefer to appoint one ASAP.

254
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:25,834
No organization can maintain stability
when the head's been chopped off.

255
00:25:26,084 --> 00:25:31,584
We got business in the works
and if we don't attend to them,

256
00:25:31,584 --> 00:25:35,209
people will start to get funny ideas.

257
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:40,167
It'll get ugly real fast.

258
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:46,959
Then let's call a board meeting
this month and vote.

259
00:25:53,126 --> 00:25:54,584
Any thoughts?

260
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:59,334
I agree with you all.

261
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:03,042
What about you?

262
00:26:03,251 --> 00:26:05,709
There's no reason to object.

263
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:09,917
It's not good to keep that seat empty too long.

264
00:26:12,626 --> 00:26:16,501
Okay, it's settled then,

265
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:22,376
we'll call a board meeting next week
and appoint a successor.

266
00:26:23,334 --> 00:26:27,167
If there's nothing else, I'll head out.

267
00:26:28,084 --> 00:26:30,542
Got business to attend to.

268
00:26:31,084 --> 00:26:31,917
Yo.

269
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,667
Since we're all here, let's grab a bite.

270
00:26:37,084 --> 00:26:38,292
Forget it.

271
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:42,834
I got no time for bullshit pleasantries
over a meal,

272
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,667
especially with you.

273
00:26:46,626 --> 00:26:49,126
I'd rather choke to death.

274
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:55,001
Shit, those are some choice words.

275
00:26:55,001 --> 00:26:58,292
I'm off then.

276
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:10,792
Hemorrhaging asshole.

277
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:30,917
Senile old fucks, rolling their eyes and shit.

278
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:34,209
Fucking eunuchs.

279
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:41,459
Oh yeah, bro, I have a big favor to ask you.

280
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,334
I'm not interested.

281
00:27:44,001 --> 00:27:46,126
You cold bastard.

282
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:53,751
I have to get back to Shanghai in 2 days.

283
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:59,251
Couldn't finish the deal
because the old man got himself killed.

284
00:27:59,251 --> 00:28:03,959
It'll only take a few days,
look after my office for me.

285
00:28:04,626 --> 00:28:05,959
Alright.

286
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:11,584
Fuck, you scared me, lighten up.

287
00:28:12,376 --> 00:28:15,292
Go fuck yourself, little bitch.

288
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:24,251
If Joong-go knew I left my nest empty,
he might stir shit up,

289
00:28:24,251 --> 00:28:26,376
so keep it to yourself.

290
00:28:26,376 --> 00:28:29,834
He's not going through puberty,
he won't do anything.

291
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,001
There're too many eyes right now.

292
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:35,042
That fucker is a walking puberty.

293
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:39,584
Where's the car? Didn't I tell you to park close?!

294
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:44,584
What the fuck?

295
00:28:53,084 --> 00:28:54,126
Did I scare you?

296
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:56,917
Got a jolt?

297
00:28:57,251 --> 00:28:59,376
Look, this isn't funny!

298
00:28:59,542 --> 00:29:01,542
I'm sorry.

299
00:29:02,584 --> 00:29:04,626
You piece of shit, drive properly!

300
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:07,376
Our colleagues had heart attacks.

301
00:29:07,376 --> 00:29:08,959
My apologies, boss.

302
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:11,501
How the fuck did you get a license?

303
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:16,126
I thought you had important business.

304
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:20,334
Forgot the way out? Need a map?

305
00:29:22,001 --> 00:29:25,001
You need to work on your sense of humor.

306
00:29:26,209 --> 00:29:27,917
Take care, you hear?

307
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:30,209
Take care.

308
00:29:45,376 --> 00:29:47,501
See that? You see what I mean?

309
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:50,417
That prick won't change until he's buried.

310
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:52,959
Shit, I think I pissed a little.

311
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,542
Yo bro!

312
00:29:56,917 --> 00:29:58,917
That was nice.

313
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:03,626
Damn, my heart's pounding!

314
00:30:03,626 --> 00:30:07,209
Let's go get some pussy,
or get shitfaced with pussies.

315
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:08,792
I'm fine, you go ahead.

316
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:10,084
- Shit.
- Go on.

317
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:14,584
I don't enjoy fucking those virgins,
I just wanna calm my nerves.

318
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:17,667
- In-out, in-out.
- Go on, drive.

319
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:19,876
Come on, hop in.

320
00:30:19,876 --> 00:30:21,584
I really can't today.

321
00:30:21,584 --> 00:30:22,834
Get in!

322
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:28,251
Follow us.

323
00:30:37,042 --> 00:30:41,667
Yo bro, something on your mind?

324
00:30:42,084 --> 00:30:43,667
You look like shit.

325
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:50,376
I'm just... tired lately.

326
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:54,792
We got important shit coming up,
you need to shape up.

327
00:30:55,417 --> 00:30:57,584
I'll get you some ginseng meds.

328
00:30:59,084 --> 00:31:03,792
I thought your face couldn't
get any uglier, but I guess not.

329
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:08,542
Hello?

330
00:31:11,251 --> 00:31:14,084
I don't need a loan, I'm rich.

331
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,501
I pray to God,

332
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:23,334
I hope your child takes after your wife.

333
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:36,251
We have to play the hand we're dealt,

334
00:31:37,126 --> 00:31:39,376
it'll all work out for the best.

335
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:45,334
You just follow my lead like a sheep.

336
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:49,751
Funny shit, huh?

337
00:31:50,626 --> 00:31:55,751
My chink brothers! Fill your glasses!

338
00:32:02,709 --> 00:32:05,501
Raise your glasses!
Let's drink to his unborn child!

339
00:32:05,501 --> 00:32:10,667
Let's all pray,please take after his wife!

340
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:15,501
You speak the truth!

341
00:32:16,584 --> 00:32:19,001
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

342
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:25,042
- Lemme pour for you.
- Yes, sir!

343
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:27,959
Sit down, asswipe, with the big cup.

344
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:36,626
Will you stop messing with the leaf?

345
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,709
They got feelings too.

346
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:52,834
How are other clans reacting?

347
00:32:54,084 --> 00:32:59,834
Them? They're busy figuring out who to side with.

348
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:04,792
Indeed, this will determine
if they'll live or not.

349
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:09,001
How's Ja-sung?

350
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:12,376
Heard he's got a kid on the way.

351
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:14,292
How's he coping?

352
00:33:16,001 --> 00:33:19,959
Of course not, would you be?

353
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:25,709
But what can he do?

354
00:33:27,001 --> 00:33:28,292
He has no say.

355
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:30,834
Keep a tight leash on him,

356
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:35,667
we can't lose control of him at this point...

357
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:37,209
I know, I know.

358
00:33:40,876 --> 00:33:42,334
The plan's good.

359
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:51,917
Alright, proceed as written here,

360
00:33:53,126 --> 00:33:54,542
do this right.

361
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:18,417
My boss...

362
00:34:20,001 --> 00:34:20,959
I mean...

363
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:27,542
I uploaded LEE Joong-gu's file
that JUNG Chung had.

364
00:34:28,292 --> 00:34:31,167
That won't be enough to charge him.

365
00:34:31,376 --> 00:34:35,584
It should be enough. We'll take care of it.

366
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:39,209
Who's the other snitch?

367
00:34:42,751 --> 00:34:44,376
Is he a cop too?

368
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,751
Or intelligence?

369
00:34:48,751 --> 00:34:52,084
I'm not in the loop on this intel either.

370
00:34:59,584 --> 00:35:01,834
What's the grand plan?

371
00:35:03,209 --> 00:35:05,001
There must be one by now.

372
00:35:09,334 --> 00:35:13,667
Can't even tell me that?
Shut up and do what I'm told?

373
00:35:18,876 --> 00:35:21,209
What am I to you all?

374
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:27,209
Even those scumbags trust me,
why can't my own guys?

375
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,334
I follow all your orders!

376
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:32,751
- As per protocol...
- Fuck that!

377
00:35:41,709 --> 00:35:43,417
Fuck your protocols!

378
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:50,001
My neck is on the line here.

379
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:57,459
I'm a cop too,
we're on the same side, right?

380
00:36:20,084 --> 00:36:25,084
JUNG's flying out tomorrow afternoon,

381
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,334
check the itinerary.

382
00:37:02,459 --> 00:37:03,751
Nice shot.

383
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:11,001
- Nice shot.
- Great form.

384
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:28,459
Do you all get to hit the green nowadays?

385
00:37:28,792 --> 00:37:33,542
Usually, but not so much these days.

386
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:39,584
You know how unhinged things are now...

387
00:37:39,584 --> 00:37:44,084
With the chairman's passing and everything.

388
00:37:44,209 --> 00:37:46,126
Goddammit.

389
00:37:47,334 --> 00:37:49,709
Was that for me to hear?

390
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:54,292
No, no, of course not.

391
00:37:54,584 --> 00:37:59,917
Why'd we pick a fight with you? Of course not.

392
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:03,959
We're family, no need to get all worked up.

393
00:38:04,334 --> 00:38:09,251
Family? So how do you explain your behavior then?

394
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:16,876
Abandoning one of your own and sucking up to JUNG.

395
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:19,376
Didn't you?

396
00:38:20,126 --> 00:38:21,459
Or you?

397
00:38:22,792 --> 00:38:24,042
Who was it?

398
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:28,334
Joong-go, listen to me.

399
00:38:28,584 --> 00:38:35,584
You got it all wrong.
We couldn't possibly have done that.

400
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:40,667
We just accepted him
because the chairman adored him.

401
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:44,042
- We take care of our own.
- That's right.

402
00:38:44,042 --> 00:38:47,251
That chink bastard is not one of us.

403
00:38:47,251 --> 00:38:48,334
Right, right.

404
00:38:48,334 --> 00:38:52,209
So next week's pissing contest is pointless then.

405
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:55,542
JANG won't side with anyone,

406
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:59,334
and JUNG's clan doesn't have enough sway

407
00:38:59,334 --> 00:39:04,751
to overcome this family, isn't that right?

408
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:07,126
That's right.

409
00:39:10,501 --> 00:39:16,126
Everyone knows we got your back.

410
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:19,251
That's the truth...

411
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:23,251
- But...
- Something for you?

412
00:39:23,251 --> 00:39:24,792
Of course there is.

413
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:29,417
You get to keep your head.

414
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:43,126
Was the chairman's death really an accident?

415
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:48,334
I feel terrible about leaving like this.

416
00:39:48,334 --> 00:39:51,459
Will you stop it? Stop kissing my ass.

417
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:54,001
It's because I feel really bad about it.

418
00:39:54,001 --> 00:39:56,251
Why don't you just stay then?

419
00:39:56,251 --> 00:40:01,084
Gonna be like that? Alright, I'll stop.

420
00:40:02,626 --> 00:40:04,417
In any case, just make sure...

421
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:08,542
Okay, okay, I'll stop, you bastard.

422
00:40:22,042 --> 00:40:26,167
- Fine, fine!
- Okay, okay!

423
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:29,584
I'll buy real shit this time,
not cheap knock-offs.

424
00:40:29,584 --> 00:40:34,459
Will you just go?! Not like you're off to war.

425
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:38,084
Is something really up?

426
00:40:38,209 --> 00:40:42,084
What's with the attitude lately?
I'm off to war, fuckhead!

427
00:40:44,001 --> 00:40:45,501
Good afternoon.

428
00:40:49,126 --> 00:40:50,459
Have a safe trip!

429
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:29,251
What, you got an appointment with me?

430
00:41:29,459 --> 00:41:32,292
Come with us, you'll find out.

431
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:36,959
I'm his lawyer.

432
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:39,084
What's this about? Go through me first.

433
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:41,209
What's he saying?

434
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:43,792
Come with us quietly.

435
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:47,959
Why not.

436
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:51,251
But will you reimburse the ticket
if I miss the flight?

437
00:41:51,251 --> 00:41:53,001
Don't you worry.

438
00:41:54,334 --> 00:41:56,417
We fly first class.

439
00:41:56,584 --> 00:41:58,917
National Police Agency Chief KANG Hyung-chul

440
00:42:09,876 --> 00:42:12,792
I've been really busy with work,

441
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:17,792
so what exactly is the purpose of our chat?

442
00:42:22,292 --> 00:42:26,126
It's because of that work of yours.

443
00:42:30,709 --> 00:42:32,751
Goldmoon Corruption Investigation Report

444
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:06,126
This is pretty serious stuff, right here.

445
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:11,126
Make a decision.
There's still time before your flight.

446
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:14,459
I'm gonna smoke.

447
00:43:26,917 --> 00:43:31,209
So you want to take care of Joong-go,

448
00:43:32,459 --> 00:43:35,251
in other words, you'll back me up?

449
00:43:35,251 --> 00:43:41,042
Right, as you know, you got
no chance against him.

450
00:43:43,626 --> 00:43:46,917
Thanks for seeing me in a good light,

451
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:51,334
but we're not playground bullies.

452
00:43:51,334 --> 00:43:53,334
And we're not mall cops.

453
00:43:53,792 --> 00:43:57,709
- You're underestimating us.
- Your words, not mine.

454
00:44:08,334 --> 00:44:14,376
Are you really asking
for something to prosecute him?

455
00:44:15,084 --> 00:44:20,417
We don't always see eye to eye,
but this is pretty low.

456
00:44:23,251 --> 00:44:25,292
Read it on your flight.

457
00:44:40,376 --> 00:44:43,459
This looks like our own stuff.

458
00:44:44,334 --> 00:44:49,042
Fuck, I thought we smoked out all the moles.

459
00:44:49,667 --> 00:44:52,334
Looks like there's more left.

460
00:44:53,209 --> 00:44:55,959
Let's get one thing straight.

461
00:44:56,251 --> 00:45:00,417
You accused SEOK's men as moles
and eliminated them.

462
00:45:00,834 --> 00:45:04,334
And SEOK was a necessary casualty
on your way to the throne.

463
00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:07,917
Right?

464
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:15,292
Make of that what you will.

465
00:45:17,292 --> 00:45:22,167
If you collected this much dirt,
can't you do whatever you want?

466
00:45:22,376 --> 00:45:24,292
It's for everyone's good.

467
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:28,834
We're asking for consent
before the shit hits the fan.

468
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:32,792
Consent? More like a notice.

469
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:36,126
Enough for today, you're late for your flight.

470
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:49,001
By the way, how did you know
I was flying out today?

471
00:45:49,209 --> 00:45:51,626
And perfect timing too.

472
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,751
Now it all makes sense.

473
00:45:57,667 --> 00:46:02,042
You got plenty of rats inside.

474
00:46:04,042 --> 00:46:05,167
Must be nice.

475
00:46:16,626 --> 00:46:18,292
Look into him.

476
00:46:18,292 --> 00:46:22,959
Any dirt in his official police records
to personal details.

477
00:46:23,167 --> 00:46:25,334
Money is no object,

478
00:46:26,292 --> 00:46:30,917
get the best people on it.

479
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:37,376
I know just the right group for it.

480
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:41,417
And...

481
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:48,709
call the Yanbian hobos.

482
00:46:50,084 --> 00:46:53,376
Will you handle this yourself?

483
00:47:02,126 --> 00:47:04,376
Fucker...

484
00:47:04,876 --> 00:47:08,001
So he wants to play?

485
00:47:09,084 --> 00:47:12,792
Yeah, are you on Joong-go?

486
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:17,417
Good boy.

487
00:47:18,084 --> 00:47:22,126
We're moving in first thing tomorrow
so gather some muscle.

488
00:47:22,417 --> 00:47:24,501
Okay.

489
00:47:30,834 --> 00:47:33,292
How's that old geezer JANG?

490
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:40,167
What can a feeble chump do?
He just leads a lonely life.

491
00:47:40,167 --> 00:47:44,876
Aside from other geezers
dropping by for tea, nothing, boss.

492
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:47,876
Tea won't class them up.

493
00:47:49,334 --> 00:47:53,501
Stay on those senile pricks
until the board meeting.

494
00:47:53,959 --> 00:47:56,209
Those eunuchs can't be trusted.

495
00:47:56,209 --> 00:47:58,542
- Don't worry, boss.
- Yes, boss.

496
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:02,084
If one of them tries to step out of the line...

497
00:48:03,334 --> 00:48:07,209
I'll chop their balls off
and feed them to their kids.

498
00:48:09,209 --> 00:48:12,542
Shit, you fucking scare me!

499
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:16,584
You never did learn
the art of subtlety and elegance.

500
00:48:17,167 --> 00:48:21,167
'Chopping balls off', listen to this guy.

501
00:48:22,959 --> 00:48:25,751
By the way, boss, what about JUNG Chung?

502
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:29,959
When you take the chair, he'll dust up a storm.

503
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:37,792
Enough business talk,
let's savor this meal.

504
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:42,876
Veal here is so tender,
and it's real Korean beef.

505
00:48:42,876 --> 00:48:44,417
Yes, boss.

506
00:48:51,459 --> 00:48:54,376
- Who the fuck are you?
- Grab him.

507
00:48:55,709 --> 00:48:57,959
Who let them in?

508
00:48:58,626 --> 00:49:01,542
It's alright, sit, sit.

509
00:49:08,917 --> 00:49:10,376
Who the hell are you?

510
00:49:10,376 --> 00:49:14,417
Why are you ruining
a perfectly fine breakfast for us?

511
00:49:14,626 --> 00:49:17,417
Can't you see we're eating here?

512
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:20,667
It looks like you're almost done.

513
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:28,001
Well, I'll be damned, it's lieutenant...

514
00:49:29,084 --> 00:49:30,792
Right, you got promoted.

515
00:49:31,292 --> 00:49:34,584
Chief KANG, our paths cross too much.

516
00:49:35,917 --> 00:49:37,751
You piece of shit.

517
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:41,251
I'm getting tired of your mouth.

518
00:49:41,251 --> 00:49:46,251
This restaurant is a bit out of your league.

519
00:49:46,251 --> 00:49:49,834
Your salary won't even cover the dessert.

520
00:49:50,542 --> 00:49:54,084
Well, look at this...

521
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:58,501
how can you eat this in the morning?

522
00:49:59,334 --> 00:50:02,167
Know your place in life.

523
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:04,292
Chief KANG...

524
00:50:08,084 --> 00:50:10,167
It's long, bear with me.

525
00:50:10,584 --> 00:50:17,876
LEE Joong-go, you're charged with
murder, fraud, assault, extortion,

526
00:50:18,334 --> 00:50:23,001
and... yadda yadda yadda.

527
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:24,876
So damn much.

528
00:50:25,584 --> 00:50:29,876
It's too early for half-assed jokes.

529
00:50:29,876 --> 00:50:32,167
I'm not much of a joker.

530
00:50:32,167 --> 00:50:33,709
Are you really up for this?

531
00:50:34,376 --> 00:50:36,292
Think you can take me on?

532
00:50:37,417 --> 00:50:38,917
The charges won't stick.

533
00:50:39,042 --> 00:50:41,876
This is a court-certified warrant,

534
00:50:43,834 --> 00:50:47,917
we won't disappoint you this time.

535
00:50:52,667 --> 00:50:53,542
Take him away.

536
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:58,501
- Boss!
- Boss!

537
00:51:00,042 --> 00:51:03,792
Who was it, was it that fucker JUNG?

538
00:51:06,209 --> 00:51:07,334
I wonder,

539
00:51:08,876 --> 00:51:10,001
who could it be?

540
00:51:12,792 --> 00:51:15,459
- Boss, no!
- Sir!

541
00:51:40,417 --> 00:51:42,584
Call a meeting.

542
00:51:43,209 --> 00:51:46,876
Okay, and I'll book the flight back.

543
00:51:50,126 --> 00:51:52,959
Is the file on chief KANG not ready yet?

544
00:51:53,251 --> 00:51:57,376
I made sure to have it for you when we arrive.

545
00:52:01,334 --> 00:52:03,001
And the Yanbian hobos?

546
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:09,876
They should've arrived by now.

547
00:52:23,459 --> 00:52:25,876
Incheon International Ferry Terminal

548
00:52:43,376 --> 00:52:46,417
Try not to look like hicks too much.

549
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:49,292
No need to be so obvious.

550
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,167
We don't need extra attention.

551
00:52:53,501 --> 00:52:55,751
- You hear?
- Okay.

552
00:52:57,292 --> 00:52:58,792
Let's get going!

553
00:53:05,834 --> 00:53:07,376
You see?!

554
00:53:08,709 --> 00:53:11,334
The Koreans sense these things!

555
00:53:11,834 --> 00:53:14,126
They already know we're Yanbians!

556
00:53:18,001 --> 00:53:19,709
Let's go!

557
00:53:34,959 --> 00:53:42,542
This is the face, fingers and toes.

558
00:53:42,626 --> 00:53:47,126
Hear his heartbeat? He's healthy.

559
00:53:47,876 --> 00:53:51,542
You'll feel the baby kicking from now on.

560
00:53:52,126 --> 00:53:56,209
You'll gain weight noticeably and...

561
00:54:02,001 --> 00:54:03,459
Should we...

562
00:54:07,167 --> 00:54:08,876
live abroad?

563
00:54:23,626 --> 00:54:24,792
Hello?

564
00:54:39,834 --> 00:54:42,751
Haven't received a report in weeks.

565
00:54:44,334 --> 00:54:46,459
There was nothing special.

566
00:54:47,209 --> 00:54:48,584
'Nothing special'?

567
00:54:49,042 --> 00:54:52,542
And other times were special?

568
00:54:53,084 --> 00:54:58,751
When does he get home,
what he eats, how much he eats,

569
00:54:58,751 --> 00:55:00,959
does he snore or not, that stuff,

570
00:55:00,959 --> 00:55:04,959
I told you no detail is too small to leave out.

571
00:55:06,417 --> 00:55:09,917
Is your baby making you soft?

572
00:55:09,917 --> 00:55:11,667
Don't talk about my baby!

573
00:55:14,376 --> 00:55:17,959
I want to quit.

574
00:55:18,417 --> 00:55:20,042
Quit?

575
00:55:23,917 --> 00:55:28,667
You wanted this in exchange
for your dope fiend father.

576
00:55:29,584 --> 00:55:33,792
We pulled you out of that bar
and made you whole,

577
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:36,584
shouldn't you be grateful?

578
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:43,376
That dope fiend is dead,
and Ja-sung was the one who saved me.

579
00:55:43,626 --> 00:55:46,917
Don't you worry, I'll live for him.

580
00:55:46,917 --> 00:55:48,209
Is that so?

581
00:55:51,126 --> 00:55:54,042
You think that's so easy?

582
00:55:54,542 --> 00:55:59,334
How would he feel if he knew you're spying for us?

583
00:55:59,584 --> 00:56:03,584
That thug would love that, won't he?

584
00:56:04,751 --> 00:56:06,459
Son of a bitch...

585
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:12,834
Sure, but what can I do, this is my job.

586
00:56:14,084 --> 00:56:18,917
Do yours right, got it?

587
00:56:40,917 --> 00:56:47,459
The cops really went all out this time.

588
00:56:49,251 --> 00:56:56,209
Perhaps they really got enough dirt to prosecute.

589
00:56:57,626 --> 00:56:58,751
Yeah?

590
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:02,792
Then who provided the dirt?

591
00:57:04,876 --> 00:57:07,542
You think I did this?

592
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:10,959
I don't stoop that low.

593
00:57:13,334 --> 00:57:16,334
And I never had that kind of dirt.

594
00:57:16,584 --> 00:57:19,959
Is that so? Then who could it be?

595
00:57:20,626 --> 00:57:25,084
If not you, probably one of yours then.

596
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:29,251
Your boy Ja-sung perhaps?

597
00:57:31,751 --> 00:57:36,667
Fucking traitor, this is how you do me?

598
00:57:37,626 --> 00:57:42,834
Keep me busy and take over
the entire organization?

599
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:45,209
- Yo, Joong-go...
- Motherfucker!

600
00:57:45,542 --> 00:57:47,334
I'll fucking split your mouth!

601
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:11,709
I'll fucking split your mouth,
if you ever say my name again.

602
00:58:13,834 --> 00:58:15,126
Try me.

603
00:58:17,834 --> 00:58:20,917
Come at me all you want,

604
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:24,001
see if you get your way.

605
00:58:33,751 --> 00:58:36,917
Our lawyer's doing his best,

606
00:58:38,459 --> 00:58:39,876
so sit tight.

607
00:58:41,001 --> 00:58:43,792
We greased enough of them over the years,

608
00:58:46,376 --> 00:58:48,084
it'll work out.

609
00:58:50,084 --> 00:58:51,876
Did you...

610
00:58:54,042 --> 00:58:55,834
offed the old man?

611
00:59:00,917 --> 00:59:02,751
It wasn't you?

612
00:59:05,084 --> 00:59:11,126
If not, it could've been one of the moles, or...

613
00:59:11,126 --> 00:59:12,459
Or?

614
00:59:14,792 --> 00:59:17,209
A thousand others.

615
00:59:21,334 --> 00:59:23,876
Eat this, you fucking chink.

616
00:59:28,084 --> 00:59:29,834
Yo JUNG.

617
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:33,584
Please...

618
00:59:35,167 --> 00:59:36,376
watch your back.

619
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:49,501
Thank you for thinking of me,

620
00:59:50,792 --> 00:59:52,001
even behind bars.

621
00:59:54,251 --> 00:59:55,959
You're really something...

622
01:00:22,334 --> 01:00:24,126
Bring it.

623
01:00:37,751 --> 01:00:40,251
It's a small token of my appreciation.

624
01:00:40,917 --> 01:00:44,126
What is it, something edible?

625
01:00:44,292 --> 01:00:50,501
It's Chinese mooncake, a real delicacy.

626
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:56,542
Mooncake, huh?

627
01:00:58,417 --> 01:01:00,834
Come on, open it at home.

628
01:01:01,001 --> 01:01:05,584
How do you eat it? Like this?

629
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:12,792
This doesn't look edible.

630
01:01:12,792 --> 01:01:17,209
It's laundered clean, there's no need to worry.

631
01:01:17,459 --> 01:01:19,667
I'll take good care of you.

632
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:24,167
We'll send you a regular care package,

633
01:01:24,167 --> 01:01:25,876
consider it your retirement fund.

634
01:01:29,584 --> 01:01:33,959
You just have to back off and let us do our thing.

635
01:01:34,751 --> 01:01:37,292
Don't dig into our affairs too much.

636
01:01:45,667 --> 01:01:48,042
- Give me a smoke.
- Yes, boss.

637
01:01:53,917 --> 01:01:59,376
What, don't like it? Need some more?

638
01:01:59,376 --> 01:02:02,084
Do you want a share of our earnings then?

639
01:02:03,376 --> 01:02:05,292
Hey JUNG Chung,

640
01:02:06,542 --> 01:02:08,417
what do you take me for?

641
01:02:14,417 --> 01:02:15,834
Take it back.

642
01:02:17,459 --> 01:02:19,959
I don't take money from gangsters.

643
01:02:23,251 --> 01:02:25,167
Then what do you want?

644
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:32,751
You're not trying to wipe us out,
so you must want something.

645
01:02:32,751 --> 01:02:34,626
Wipe you out?

646
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:38,459
Someone else will take your place in no time.

647
01:02:39,459 --> 01:02:43,626
And start a new investigation? Too much hassle.

648
01:02:43,876 --> 01:02:47,209
We're not asking much from you.

649
01:02:47,626 --> 01:02:52,167
Just know your place, and do as you're told.

650
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:54,709
No need to overreact to everything.

651
01:02:55,376 --> 01:03:00,334
So you want us to run errands for you dicks?

652
01:03:00,959 --> 01:03:03,376
Like fucking ball-less lapdogs?

653
01:03:04,001 --> 01:03:07,626
There's no need for that.

654
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:09,667
Think of it as,

655
01:03:10,667 --> 01:03:13,251
a cooperative relationship.

656
01:03:13,917 --> 01:03:16,292
- Grab the cash.
- Yes, sir.

657
01:03:26,042 --> 01:03:29,667
Alright, enough, go away!

658
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:35,209
Okay, I hear you.

659
01:03:35,209 --> 01:03:39,251
I got your message loud and clear,

660
01:03:40,792 --> 01:03:43,042
you'll hear from me soon.

661
01:04:10,209 --> 01:04:12,876
It's chief KANG's personnel file,

662
01:04:12,876 --> 01:04:15,042
both professional and personal...

663
01:04:15,042 --> 01:04:16,334
Shut up!

664
01:04:20,417 --> 01:04:23,834
Is this accurate?

665
01:04:24,834 --> 01:04:28,542
I got it from one of
the best Chinese hacker groups,

666
01:04:28,542 --> 01:04:36,459
these guys can infiltrate
the FBI database in 2 days tops.

667
01:04:41,167 --> 01:04:42,834
And the Yanbian hobos?

668
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:44,667
They're standing by.

669
01:04:54,709 --> 01:04:56,126
Incoming call - Bro

670
01:05:03,001 --> 01:05:07,084
My fucking bro! Where you at?

671
01:05:07,084 --> 01:05:10,292
When did you get in? Today?

672
01:05:10,751 --> 01:05:12,792
Why didn't you call?

673
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,751
Of course it's not a problem.

674
01:05:18,709 --> 01:05:21,209
What surprise?

675
01:05:25,792 --> 01:05:27,292
Why there?

676
01:05:31,542 --> 01:05:33,209
Okay.

677
01:05:36,792 --> 01:05:40,001
Wasn't he due back in 2 days?

678
01:05:40,251 --> 01:05:42,959
It's not like him.

679
01:05:42,959 --> 01:05:45,001
To the Incheon warehouse.

680
01:05:45,417 --> 01:05:46,292
Yes, boss.

681
01:05:50,876 --> 01:05:52,376
Pull over.

682
01:06:00,709 --> 01:06:02,292
What would you like to do?

683
01:06:10,001 --> 01:06:12,584
Call in the hobos.

684
01:07:19,459 --> 01:07:21,626
I think my cover is blown.

685
01:07:21,626 --> 01:07:24,459
Wipe my file and clean this place.

686
01:07:28,042 --> 01:07:32,126
And please quit smoking.

687
01:07:33,334 --> 01:07:34,459
Take care.

688
01:08:05,542 --> 01:08:07,626
She killed the lights?

689
01:08:39,876 --> 01:08:43,876
Holy shit! You never said she had a gun!

690
01:08:43,876 --> 01:08:45,542
I wasn't told either, fuckwad!

691
01:08:46,376 --> 01:08:48,209
We still gotta keep her alive?

692
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:52,167
- Yeah, that's the order.
- Let's hang back.

693
01:08:53,334 --> 01:08:58,042
It's a six-shooter, she's got 3 bullets left.

694
01:08:59,084 --> 01:09:01,584
Hey retard! This isn't Yanbian!

695
01:09:02,584 --> 01:09:06,751
Didn't you hear the gunshots?!
The cops will be all over this shit!

696
01:09:08,626 --> 01:09:10,501
Then what do we do?

697
01:09:10,626 --> 01:09:13,209
Let's just blitz her!

698
01:09:13,751 --> 01:09:15,292
Isn't that dangerous?

699
01:09:15,292 --> 01:09:17,084
Are we on a vacation?

700
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:19,459
Let's move!

701
01:10:46,626 --> 01:10:48,459
He's waiting inside, sir.

702
01:11:00,084 --> 01:11:01,834
Why all the way here?

703
01:11:01,834 --> 01:11:04,376
You're here, a bit late though.

704
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:07,584
Yeah, because of the rain and traffic.

705
01:11:08,292 --> 01:11:11,709
Suk-mu, you fuck.

706
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:15,792
I told you to buy the newest GPS.

707
01:11:16,792 --> 01:11:20,376
You get realtime traffic info,motherfucker.

708
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:22,251
That's how we got here.

709
01:11:25,501 --> 01:11:26,501
Bring it.

710
01:11:29,917 --> 01:11:31,042
Come!

711
01:11:49,334 --> 01:11:50,709
Yo bro.

712
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:07,834
Wanna see what's inside that barrel?

713
01:12:15,584 --> 01:12:17,126
Give me a smoke.

714
01:12:49,584 --> 01:12:51,376
Tada!

715
01:12:57,126 --> 01:12:59,292
It's your chess teacher.

716
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:02,584
Surprised?

717
01:13:05,251 --> 01:13:09,292
Pretty cute and a fuckable body too.

718
01:13:09,584 --> 01:13:12,209
Those juicy tits...

719
01:13:13,459 --> 01:13:14,834
Yo bro.

720
01:13:16,459 --> 01:13:18,251
Did you know?

721
01:13:20,751 --> 01:13:24,251
That cunt is a spy.

722
01:13:25,709 --> 01:13:27,042
A cop.

723
01:13:28,751 --> 01:13:30,751
She's a cop.

724
01:13:40,751 --> 01:13:45,667
Did you know that?

725
01:13:48,042 --> 01:13:49,792
No, I...

726
01:13:52,292 --> 01:13:53,292
I didn't.

727
01:13:59,584 --> 01:14:02,292
She's a strong one, that bitch.

728
01:14:02,584 --> 01:14:06,542
She won't talk no matter what.

729
01:14:07,167 --> 01:14:11,959
She's better than my boys, I'll give you that.

730
01:14:14,959 --> 01:14:23,209
But I already knew what I wanted to know,

731
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:30,084
I figured I'd confirm it with her.

732
01:14:33,917 --> 01:14:35,917
This right here.

733
01:14:37,501 --> 01:14:40,584
I paid a fortune in China for this file.

734
01:14:41,709 --> 01:14:43,167
Check it out.

735
01:14:52,001 --> 01:14:55,042
Even I was shocked.

736
01:14:56,042 --> 01:15:02,417
Not just a mole, but a cop was part of our family.

737
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:06,251
Go on, look.

738
01:15:11,251 --> 01:15:15,417
That cum stain beside her is chief KANG,

739
01:15:16,501 --> 01:15:19,584
he's the one barking up our asses.

740
01:15:26,167 --> 01:15:30,001
He was an instructor when she was at the Academy.

741
01:15:30,876 --> 01:15:35,209
So he was her mentor and shit.

742
01:15:35,834 --> 01:15:38,334
Probably popped her cherry.

743
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,417
Read the next one.

744
01:15:44,126 --> 01:15:45,834
There's one more.

745
01:15:50,834 --> 01:15:52,917
That fucker there,

746
01:15:56,001 --> 01:15:58,209
really got me.

747
01:16:02,501 --> 01:16:03,834
Son of a bitch!

748
01:16:06,376 --> 01:16:07,584
Motherfucker!

749
01:16:20,626 --> 01:16:21,917
Yo bro!

750
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:25,209
Shocked?

751
01:16:43,917 --> 01:16:48,376
These fuck-holes were playing you all this time.

752
01:16:51,584 --> 01:16:54,251
Shit, it's not cutting through!

753
01:17:08,417 --> 01:17:14,001
Chief KANG'll get the message, don't you think?

754
01:17:18,459 --> 01:17:20,459
- Yo Yanbians!
- Yeah?

755
01:17:21,792 --> 01:17:26,834
Have some fun and toss her with the body.

756
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:28,626
Okay.

757
01:17:29,709 --> 01:17:30,876
Let's go.

758
01:17:33,584 --> 01:17:40,501
When I'm through with you,
you'll beg me for death.

759
01:18:44,626 --> 01:18:46,626
What? A booty call at this hour?

760
01:18:49,584 --> 01:18:51,542
You're violating my right to sleep.

761
01:18:54,876 --> 01:18:57,209
Got some news that'll wake you up.

762
01:18:57,667 --> 01:18:59,334
This better be good.

763
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:01,292
A new board meeting is called.

764
01:19:02,626 --> 01:19:04,626
In 2 days, 5 pm.

765
01:19:05,209 --> 01:19:10,042
JUNG'll take the helm since you're in here.

766
01:19:13,292 --> 01:19:16,667
So, you're here to rub it in?

767
01:19:16,667 --> 01:19:18,667
Yeah, you useless piece of shit.

768
01:19:18,667 --> 01:19:20,251
What the fuck?!

769
01:19:20,251 --> 01:19:23,792
So useless that you lost everything to the chinks.

770
01:19:24,417 --> 01:19:27,459
Since when did the chinks take over Goldmoon?

771
01:19:28,376 --> 01:19:30,792
Didn't it belong to your clan?

772
01:19:32,417 --> 01:19:34,334
You were the rightful heir.

773
01:19:36,209 --> 01:19:39,626
I didn't know you cared so deeply for me.

774
01:19:41,126 --> 01:19:43,292
And who got me into this?

775
01:19:43,459 --> 01:19:46,792
If it weren't for you,
this wouldn't have happened.

776
01:19:47,501 --> 01:19:50,751
Boy, we're cops.

777
01:19:51,126 --> 01:19:56,751
We get a report, we investigate,
we find dirt, we arrest.

778
01:19:56,751 --> 01:19:58,376
That's our job.

779
01:20:01,834 --> 01:20:06,251
So who made that report?

780
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:45,792
JUNG Chung, you've hit rock bottom.

781
01:20:53,376 --> 01:20:54,501
So what?!

782
01:20:54,834 --> 01:20:59,001
What do you want from me? Grind my knife?

783
01:20:59,001 --> 01:21:01,542
This is your best?!

784
01:21:01,542 --> 01:21:04,959
I'm LEE Joong-go! The almighty LEE Joong-go!

785
01:22:17,251 --> 01:22:20,584
JUNG Chung, that cocksucker.

786
01:22:22,459 --> 01:22:27,376
This is rat poison, no doubt about it.

787
01:22:28,251 --> 01:22:29,167
Sir?

788
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:32,459
But I can't just let it pass.

789
01:22:35,126 --> 01:22:38,001
I can't sink alone.

790
01:22:38,751 --> 01:22:44,459
And this rat poison could be
a blessing in disguise.

791
01:22:50,167 --> 01:22:55,126
Alright, I'll play along.

792
01:22:57,667 --> 01:22:59,292
I'll play-

793
01:23:29,251 --> 01:23:31,834
HOW did JUNG find out?

794
01:23:33,542 --> 01:23:38,751
Did you make a deal with him?

795
01:23:42,084 --> 01:23:44,959
I know I'm a lowlife,

796
01:23:47,417 --> 01:23:48,959
but not that low.

797
01:23:51,917 --> 01:23:57,084
I figured it was you.

798
01:23:58,542 --> 01:24:00,126
I thought you flipped.

799
01:24:03,001 --> 01:24:04,959
We had a case like that.

800
01:24:08,334 --> 01:24:10,209
A long time ago.

801
01:24:10,334 --> 01:24:15,334
Is that why you had Suk-mu on me?
As an insurance?

802
01:24:15,876 --> 01:24:21,084
We put him there, but he didn't know about you.

803
01:24:23,376 --> 01:24:25,251
Son of a bitch.

804
01:24:25,251 --> 01:24:29,251
Don't be like that, it's almost over.

805
01:24:29,251 --> 01:24:31,417
There's nothing more to lose.

806
01:24:36,876 --> 01:24:38,959
Nothing's changed,

807
01:24:40,376 --> 01:24:42,834
we continue according to the plan.

808
01:24:44,292 --> 01:24:46,334
So what's the plan?

809
01:24:48,001 --> 01:24:49,376
The plan?!

810
01:24:52,167 --> 01:24:55,917
Who will you back between them?

811
01:24:56,167 --> 01:24:57,459
What?!

812
01:25:10,167 --> 01:25:14,042
JANG Su-ki, current vice chair of Goldmoon.

813
01:25:15,501 --> 01:25:18,834
You said he holds no power.

814
01:25:19,501 --> 01:25:24,042
He was the Jeil boss, but lost all power

815
01:25:24,042 --> 01:25:27,209
when the clans united as Goldmoon.

816
01:25:27,209 --> 01:25:30,584
At the time, Jeil was about to disband,

817
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:32,459
and he's semi-retired.

818
01:25:32,709 --> 01:25:34,501
So he's perfect for us.

819
01:25:35,542 --> 01:25:40,084
We took care of him
since the beginning so he's ripe,

820
01:25:40,792 --> 01:25:46,667
but he's so powerless that
our help alone won't do.

821
01:25:47,001 --> 01:25:50,709
That's why he needs a capable running mate.

822
01:25:51,167 --> 01:25:52,459
A running mate?

823
01:25:53,001 --> 01:25:55,417
This is Goldmoon's COO LEE Ja-sung.

824
01:25:55,417 --> 01:25:57,501
He's from the same town as JUNG,

825
01:25:57,501 --> 01:26:00,501
and also a Chinese descendant.

826
01:26:00,751 --> 01:26:02,751
Will he just comply?

827
01:26:03,709 --> 01:26:06,376
He may have to betray JUNG later.

828
01:26:10,167 --> 01:26:14,584
I always wondered who my running mate was.

829
01:26:15,834 --> 01:26:19,792
With you, this may be a doable proposition.

830
01:26:21,084 --> 01:26:23,667
Ja-sung, let's go all the way.

831
01:26:24,251 --> 01:26:25,542
Son of a bitch!

832
01:26:28,084 --> 01:26:32,209
You two haven't worked it all out yet?

833
01:26:36,251 --> 01:26:41,584
Ja-sung, let's talk details later.

834
01:26:47,876 --> 01:26:50,001
What the fuck is this?!

835
01:26:50,334 --> 01:26:54,501
Use him to take over Goldmoon.

836
01:26:55,626 --> 01:26:57,459
You said this is the end,

837
01:26:58,959 --> 01:27:01,459
you said this was my last mission.

838
01:27:02,334 --> 01:27:04,126
Sir, I can't do this.

839
01:27:04,584 --> 01:27:08,834
You promised, you gave me your word!

840
01:27:08,834 --> 01:27:11,001
Don't you care what happens to me?

841
01:27:11,209 --> 01:27:12,542
Do I matter at all?

842
01:27:12,542 --> 01:27:14,334
There's no other choice.

843
01:27:15,626 --> 01:27:19,126
This is the safest path for you.

844
01:27:19,626 --> 01:27:22,959
You son of a bitch! Cut the bullshit!

845
01:27:25,917 --> 01:27:28,584
How do you think JUNG Chung found out?

846
01:27:30,834 --> 01:27:35,626
Our database was hacked last week.

847
01:27:37,042 --> 01:27:39,042
By the Chinese hackers.

848
01:27:39,126 --> 01:27:44,042
They targeted me, and stole top secret intel.

849
01:27:44,042 --> 01:27:45,876
They found Suk-mu, here too!

850
01:27:48,001 --> 01:27:49,751
They got everything.

851
01:27:51,334 --> 01:27:56,542
And your file was definitely included.

852
01:28:26,709 --> 01:28:32,542
How come you won't kill Ja-sung?

853
01:28:40,042 --> 01:28:42,042
Go over the Shanghai contract.

854
01:28:50,001 --> 01:28:53,584
I wiped all your files.

855
01:28:55,084 --> 01:29:00,167
Officer LEE Ja-sung does not exist.

856
01:29:02,251 --> 01:29:09,167
Only me and the director know about you.

857
01:29:11,251 --> 01:29:14,501
No one knows why JUNG decided to keep you,

858
01:29:15,084 --> 01:29:17,667
but it's a lucky break.

859
01:29:18,459 --> 01:29:22,042
It gave us the upper hand.

860
01:29:24,084 --> 01:29:26,542
JUNG Chung's finished, as of today.

861
01:29:28,126 --> 01:29:30,209
LEE's clan is on the move.

862
01:29:32,626 --> 01:29:34,292
Got a smoke?

863
01:29:45,709 --> 01:29:46,834
What the?

864
01:29:49,667 --> 01:29:50,501
Shit!

865
01:29:51,584 --> 01:29:52,501
Get him!

866
01:30:04,376 --> 01:30:06,292
Motherfuckers!

867
01:30:43,626 --> 01:30:45,001
Boss, you have to go!

868
01:30:45,001 --> 01:30:46,667
Let go of me, assholes!

869
01:30:49,626 --> 01:30:50,584
Kill 'em all!

870
01:30:50,584 --> 01:30:51,751
Motherfuckers!

871
01:30:55,876 --> 01:30:57,042
Send them to hell!

872
01:31:02,667 --> 01:31:03,959
Hold them back!

873
01:31:05,709 --> 01:31:06,876
Stop them!

874
01:32:51,042 --> 01:32:54,167
You spineless fucks...

875
01:32:55,251 --> 01:32:57,251
Did Joong-go order the hit?

876
01:32:59,334 --> 01:33:02,251
Falling for the cops' tricks?

877
01:33:03,251 --> 01:33:10,417
You underestimated our clan,
you backstabbing chink!

878
01:33:18,209 --> 01:33:22,126
Come at me, motherfuckers! Come at me!

879
01:33:22,626 --> 01:33:23,917
Do it!

880
01:34:47,542 --> 01:34:48,542
Move, move, move!

881
01:34:51,292 --> 01:34:52,542
Over here, asshole!

882
01:35:43,292 --> 01:35:48,501
Joong-go, that fucker finally
stirred up a shitstorm.

883
01:35:48,751 --> 01:35:54,209
He dragged everyone into this mess.

884
01:35:54,626 --> 01:35:58,376
Him and Jaebum clan's finished.

885
01:35:58,959 --> 01:36:03,959
There's no other way around this now.

886
01:36:05,709 --> 01:36:10,042
Someone must step up and clean up this mess.

887
01:36:11,542 --> 01:36:13,376
Isn't that right, vice chair JANG?

888
01:36:36,042 --> 01:36:40,417
We tried our best but he won't make it.

889
01:36:41,417 --> 01:36:42,542
I'm sorry.

890
01:37:02,084 --> 01:37:04,084
What do we do, boss?

891
01:37:30,876 --> 01:37:33,959
- Where's HAN Joo-kyung?
- She's...

892
01:37:35,709 --> 01:37:37,209
She's in recovery.

893
01:37:38,959 --> 01:37:41,667
I'm sorry about the baby.

894
01:37:42,334 --> 01:37:47,876
High levels of stress
and sudden shock triggered this.

895
01:37:48,542 --> 01:37:52,084
It'd have been dangerous for her too.

896
01:38:18,709 --> 01:38:22,334
Now, Ja-sung just has to take over.

897
01:38:22,751 --> 01:38:24,501
He's a made man now.

898
01:38:25,459 --> 01:38:27,959
Shouldn't he thank us for this?

899
01:38:37,334 --> 01:38:43,001
When this is done, process my resignation.

900
01:38:46,167 --> 01:38:50,667
Are you drunk? Not that shit again.

901
01:38:54,667 --> 01:38:58,459
Who'll manage this operation if you leave?

902
01:38:58,917 --> 01:39:01,626
You made this case, this is your baby.

903
01:39:03,876 --> 01:39:06,376
I can't, I'm too dumb for this shit.

904
01:39:09,334 --> 01:39:12,917
Stupidity is your excuse? Fucking moron.

905
01:39:16,501 --> 01:39:17,876
Can't take it all back.

906
01:39:23,959 --> 01:39:26,334
No one can back out of this.

907
01:39:28,251 --> 01:39:32,084
Either we see it through, or die in the process,

908
01:39:32,084 --> 01:39:34,959
so there's no turning back.

909
01:39:37,667 --> 01:39:41,126
It's a goddamn shame we lost a few of our own,

910
01:39:41,459 --> 01:39:44,667
some sacrifices are needed to win a war.

911
01:39:50,459 --> 01:39:55,751
Can you keep him on our leash?

912
01:39:56,542 --> 01:39:58,792
It won't be so easy anymore.

913
01:40:01,001 --> 01:40:06,209
What can he do? He's a shrimp caught in our net.

914
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:21,042
No, thanks.

915
01:40:22,376 --> 01:40:24,001
I quit.

916
01:40:34,376 --> 01:40:40,626
Who knew the passing of SEOK
would be such a blessing!

917
01:40:42,167 --> 01:40:43,792
Indeed!

918
01:40:44,501 --> 01:40:47,001
Now that it's all behind us,

919
01:40:47,167 --> 01:40:54,042
SEOK, and his boys LEE and JUNG
were way too uptight.

920
01:40:54,042 --> 01:40:56,376
It's a brand new era.

921
01:40:56,751 --> 01:41:01,876
Will JUNG's boys stay in line?

922
01:41:02,376 --> 01:41:04,834
They still got Ja-sung.

923
01:41:08,501 --> 01:41:10,917
Your worries are unfounded.

924
01:41:11,834 --> 01:41:18,084
I assure you, they won't act recklessly.

925
01:41:21,126 --> 01:41:26,042
I promised him the vice chair
once I become the chair.

926
01:41:29,209 --> 01:41:31,126
That's a brilliant idea!

927
01:41:31,876 --> 01:41:37,334
Succeeding in accordance
to the rank is the right thing.

928
01:41:37,917 --> 01:41:41,084
- This is great!
- Very good!

929
01:41:52,376 --> 01:41:56,626
As a precaution, I brought my own men.

930
01:41:57,876 --> 01:42:02,709
Just enough muscle for a smooth transition.

931
01:42:02,709 --> 01:42:07,001
Don't you worry, I know where I stand.

932
01:42:07,751 --> 01:42:09,667
What can I do with a few men?

933
01:42:09,667 --> 01:42:12,876
Think of them as my entourage.

934
01:42:17,126 --> 01:42:21,042
Let's finish this drink and start swinging!

935
01:42:31,167 --> 01:42:33,959
I feel so terrible!

936
01:42:34,501 --> 01:42:38,334
Asking Goldmoon's vice chair
to this shabby joint.

937
01:42:39,709 --> 01:42:41,126
What do you want?

938
01:42:41,584 --> 01:42:43,042
What do I want?

939
01:42:44,167 --> 01:42:47,917
Remember you're at my beck and call.

940
01:42:49,334 --> 01:42:53,417
Until another handler is assigned,
report directly to me.

941
01:42:54,917 --> 01:42:59,542
I'm warning you,nothing's changed.

942
01:43:00,459 --> 01:43:03,709
You're a cop, don't forget.

943
01:43:06,042 --> 01:43:11,584
And submit a revised organization chart
by next week.

944
01:43:12,417 --> 01:43:16,917
Emphasize new intel that
you didn't have access to before.

945
01:43:17,501 --> 01:43:18,709
Got it?

946
01:43:19,751 --> 01:43:25,959
Especially the top brass, feds,
and other suits on Goldmoon's payroll.

947
01:43:41,251 --> 01:43:42,834
One more thing,

948
01:43:45,417 --> 01:43:48,376
LEE will be released soon.

949
01:43:49,501 --> 01:43:50,584
What?

950
01:43:50,751 --> 01:43:52,209
Insufficient evidence.

951
01:43:52,376 --> 01:43:56,001
Let me be clear, don't touch him.

952
01:44:02,084 --> 01:44:04,167
I'm sorry about your baby.

953
01:44:06,001 --> 01:44:07,167
I mean it.

954
01:44:51,501 --> 01:44:52,584
Yeah.

955
01:44:53,126 --> 01:44:54,459
What?

956
01:45:09,626 --> 01:45:11,459
It doesn't look good.

957
01:45:12,167 --> 01:45:15,709
You should make necessary arrangements.

958
01:45:27,792 --> 01:45:30,292
Leave us.

959
01:45:33,126 --> 01:45:34,334
Let's go.

960
01:46:41,834 --> 01:46:44,542
Loosen up, you fuck.

961
01:46:46,751 --> 01:46:49,084
I'm not dead yet.

962
01:46:54,167 --> 01:46:57,292
Didn't think I'd see you again,

963
01:46:59,792 --> 01:47:01,834
so good to see you.

964
01:47:06,167 --> 01:47:08,042
Yo bro.

965
01:47:11,667 --> 01:47:13,667
You look like shit.

966
01:47:22,126 --> 01:47:25,126
It's time...

967
01:47:28,834 --> 01:47:31,501
to choose a side.

968
01:47:37,459 --> 01:47:40,292
Listen to me, asshole.

969
01:47:44,334 --> 01:47:47,126
You'll stay alive that way.

970
01:48:10,792 --> 01:48:13,001
What are you doing?

971
01:48:14,417 --> 01:48:15,876
Boss!

972
01:48:18,959 --> 01:48:20,126
Bro!

973
01:48:20,292 --> 01:48:22,834
You fucking idiot...

974
01:48:29,917 --> 01:48:32,084
What if...

975
01:48:34,209 --> 01:48:36,626
like a fucking miracle,

976
01:48:38,334 --> 01:48:41,792
I pull through?

977
01:48:44,751 --> 01:48:49,834
Think you can take on me?

978
01:49:18,751 --> 01:49:24,501
I left you a present in my office safe.

979
01:49:27,917 --> 01:49:29,917
Check it out later.

980
01:49:36,501 --> 01:49:39,626
Be strong,

981
01:49:42,084 --> 01:49:43,834
my brother.

982
01:49:44,792 --> 01:49:49,751
That's the only way for you to survive.

983
01:49:54,959 --> 01:49:57,584
Go away, I'm tired.

984
01:55:35,376 --> 01:55:37,376
I'll be damned...

985
01:55:38,751 --> 01:55:42,417
How low the almighty has fallen.

986
01:55:45,001 --> 01:55:48,834
Yes boss, he just got out.

987
01:56:42,876 --> 01:56:47,751
Ride with me, I want a word with you.

988
01:57:04,959 --> 01:57:09,792
Beautiful day, isn't it?

989
01:57:42,001 --> 01:57:43,792
He's a terrible driver.

990
01:58:42,292 --> 01:58:46,876
If you were me, wouldn't you do the same?

991
01:58:49,209 --> 01:58:51,459
KANG won't let this slide.

992
01:58:53,542 --> 01:58:55,084
What can he do?

993
01:58:56,417 --> 01:59:00,709
With you gone, he can only depend on me.

994
01:59:03,834 --> 01:59:07,042
Shall we? Let's get some air.

995
01:59:23,001 --> 01:59:27,876
Take care, send my regards to JUNG Chung.

996
02:00:11,126 --> 02:00:16,126
Give me a smoke if you got one.

997
02:00:30,917 --> 02:00:35,542
One last smoke isn't much to ask for, right?

998
02:00:58,209 --> 02:01:00,209
Today's the board meeting?

999
02:01:06,084 --> 02:01:11,542
Congratulate Ja-sung for me,
who knew he'd sit on the throne.

1000
02:01:12,209 --> 02:01:13,751
Rags to riches...

1001
02:01:28,542 --> 02:01:31,334
What a beautiful day to die.

1002
02:01:52,167 --> 02:01:55,084
HOW dare you?!

1003
02:02:56,667 --> 02:02:59,376
What a twist.

1004
02:03:03,917 --> 02:03:07,334
Hey, mister, you really have cab fare?

1005
02:03:09,001 --> 02:03:10,292
Dammit!

1006
02:03:10,792 --> 02:03:13,959
Fine, fine, don't touch!

1007
02:03:13,959 --> 02:03:15,709
Which car? That one?

1008
02:03:48,542 --> 02:03:50,667
Attention please.

1009
02:03:51,042 --> 02:03:57,334
Our current vice chair and
unanimous successor JANG Su-ki

1010
02:03:58,376 --> 02:04:06,792
has decided to forfeit his candidacy
for personal reasons.

1011
02:04:28,917 --> 02:04:33,584
And LEE Ja-sung has been nominated for the chair.

1012
02:04:34,209 --> 02:04:36,709
Any objections?

1013
02:05:31,042 --> 02:05:36,251
This is an expensive car, it's not for your...

1014
02:05:38,001 --> 02:05:41,334
Mister, pull up right beside it.

1015
02:05:41,876 --> 02:05:43,126
What, what?

1016
02:05:44,417 --> 02:05:48,167
Are you deaf? Beside that car.

1017
02:05:48,292 --> 02:05:49,459
Oh, okay...

1018
02:07:12,876 --> 02:07:17,751
Chairman LEE Ja-sung

1019
02:07:34,126 --> 02:07:35,876
What was your name?

1020
02:07:39,626 --> 02:07:41,251
LEE Ja-sung, sir.

1021
02:07:43,917 --> 02:07:45,334
LEE Ja-sung...

1022
02:07:46,959 --> 02:07:48,959
Born in Yeosu...

1023
02:07:50,667 --> 02:07:53,126
Chinese descendant, right?

1024
02:07:54,584 --> 02:07:55,834
Yes, sir.

1025
02:08:08,876 --> 02:08:14,292
I got a job for you, one that's tailored for you.

1026
02:08:17,667 --> 02:08:18,751
Sir?

1027
02:09:45,959 --> 02:09:49,334
6 years ago, Yeosu

1028
02:09:58,084 --> 02:09:59,751
Come on, hurry up!

1029
02:10:00,917 --> 02:10:03,959
Fuck, I gotta piss when I get nervous.

1030
02:10:03,959 --> 02:10:05,459
You drank like a whore.

1031
02:10:13,167 --> 02:10:15,334
- I'll be right back.
- Goddammit!

1032
02:10:21,501 --> 02:10:23,376
Shit, I got it on my pants.

1033
02:10:28,792 --> 02:10:31,459
- Any plans later?
- What do you think?

1034
02:10:35,001 --> 02:10:37,709
What the fuck?!

1035
02:10:39,834 --> 02:10:41,292
There's too many of 'em.

1036
02:10:42,667 --> 02:10:45,459
Who the fuck?!

1037
02:10:45,792 --> 02:10:48,709
I'll fucking kill you!

1038
02:11:03,792 --> 02:11:05,334
Give me a smoke.

1039
02:11:08,334 --> 02:11:12,084
Let's clean up and go watch a movie.

1040
02:11:13,584 --> 02:11:14,959
Which one?

1041
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:17,584
Porn, of course.

1042
02:11:18,917 --> 02:11:20,376
Fuck“.

1043
02:11:22,376 --> 02:11:23,667
Let's go.

1044
02:11:26,417 --> 02:11:28,417
LEE Jung-jae

1045
02:11:28,709 --> 02:11:30,709
