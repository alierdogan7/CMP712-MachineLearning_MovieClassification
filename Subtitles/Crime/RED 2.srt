how many people

that this is where you belong.

370
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,853
Right here.
In the thick of it.

371
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:11,389

372
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,156

378
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:24,034
Um... Marvin.

379
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:27,972
You gave her a gun?

380
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:29,974
It is America, Frank.

381
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:33,878

382
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,114

what to do with this.

what to do with it.

You don't give fire
to a kitten.

386
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,033
Why don't you just give her
some dynamite, Marvin?

387
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,203
No external safety
on the Sig?

388
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,113
Tell him what you told me.

389
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:13,150
Nightshade was cooked up
by a rogue US general

390
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,820
as a first strike capability
against the Soviets.

391
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:17,755
That's it. Can I go?
That's it?

392
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:19,223
You want a little pepper
with that?

393
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:20,958
No, okay! At the height
of the Cold War,

394
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,128
a megaton-yield device
was smuggled into Moscow

395
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,163
in diplomatic pouches,
piece by piece,

396
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,132
and then the weapon was lost.
That's it.

397
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:30,968
You lost a nuke in Moscow?

398
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,805
The scientist
was Edward Bailey.
That's it.

What?

400
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,581
I made a mistake.

401
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:46,650
Edward Bailey
was a genius physicist

402
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,219
who built
some of the greatest stuff

403
00:24:48,221 --> 00:24:49,587
during the Cold War.

404
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,088

405
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,923

nerve gas.

406
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,959
Excellent nerve gas.

407
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:59,597
He was a rock star
of conceptual mass killing.

408
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,866
They called him
"The Da Vinci of Death."

409
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,834
We were the security detail

410
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,637
assigned to getting him
in and out of Moscow safely.

411
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:07,571
What happened?

412
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,009
We thought he was secure.

413
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,711
The Soviets got him
with a car bomb.

414
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,013
It was my fault.

415
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:18,782
He's dead.

416

Terrible death.

1073
01:05:44,341 --> 01:05:49,077
This your little gizmo?
XKG gas. I invented it.

1074
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:51,980
We tried to take out
old Fidel Castro
in '61 in Cuba.

1075
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:53,615
That didn't work though.

1076
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:55,250
Any tea, Frank?

1077
01:05:55,252 --> 01:05:58,019
Why does Han
hate you so much?

1078
01:05:58,021 --> 01:05:59,487
Not enough hugs as a child.

1079
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:06,361
Frank framed him
for stealing state secrets.

1080
01:06:06,363 --> 01:06:08,430
So he went from being

1081
01:06:08,432 --> 01:06:11,299
a highly decorated
counter-intel officer

1082
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:14,703
to... (CHUCKLES)
...to being a pariah.

1083
01:06:14,705 --> 01:06:16,738
What's ironic though,
is that Frank

1084
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:19,641
actually created
the circumstances

1085
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:21,376
for his own death.

1086
01:06:21,378 --> 01:06:23,211
It's poetic.

1087
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:24,346
I ain't dead yet.

1088
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:36,558
Should you eat that?

1089
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,159
Is that safe?

1090
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:41,429
It's before they had that,

1091
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:43,665
you know,
"sell by" date stuff.

1092
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,033
Oh.

1093
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:48,203
So did you get to
meet Castro?

1094
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:50,605
Who?

1095
01:06:50,607 --> 01:06:52,273
Did you get to meet Castro?

1096
01:06:52,275 --> 01:06:53,608
Yes, I did, actually.
About two weeks

1097
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,110
after Kennedy
was assassinated.

1098
01:06:55,112 --> 01:06:57,379
Talking of which, Frank,

1099
01:06:57,381 --> 01:07:00,081
I'm starting to remember
more and more who I am

1100
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:01,783
and who I was
and the weapons I made.

1101
01:07:01,785 --> 01:07:04,352
My God,
it really is amazing.

1102
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:07,589
How efficiently
those boys from MI6,
may God bless 'em...

1103
01:07:07,591 --> 01:07:09,257
But you know something, Frank?

1104
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:10,759
They really do throw us away.
Don't they, old sport?

1105
01:07:10,761 --> 01:07:13,461
When we're no longer
convenient, I suppose.

1106
01:07:13,463 --> 01:07:14,662
As though
we'd never given them

1107
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:16,097
the best years of our lives.

1108
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:17,298
Bit of a joke, really.

1109
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:20,168
Yes, very strange.

1110
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:24,039
Do you remember
where Nightshade is?

1111
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:27,142
I'm sorry, my dear?

1112
01:07:27,144 --> 01:07:28,676
Do you remember
where Nightshade is?

1113
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:31,079
Oh, yes.

1114
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:34,149
Now, this feels right.

1115
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:41,222
It's around here somewhere.
I'm sure this time.

1116
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,691
Everything looks
different completely.

1117
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:45,226
Maybe it's over here.

1118
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:46,428
It's been hours. Hours.

1119
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:48,196

working out for you?

1122

BAILEY: Secret tunnels
through the old catacombs.

1127
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:05,180
Brezhnev used it
to sneak his mistress in.

1128

1130

in the Kremlin?

falls into the wrong hands...
