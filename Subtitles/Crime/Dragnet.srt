00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:54,003
in the same city where they recorded
''We Are the World.''

168
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,362
- Hi.
- Hi.

169
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:05,920
Don't get too friendly.

170
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:11,640
Hi. Can l help you?

171
00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:15,117
Police officers, ma'am.
L.A.P.D. Robbery. l'm Friday. This is--

172
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:17,437
- April!
- That's right.

173
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:19,279
She was a Baitmate.

174
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:21,597
Bait magazine.
She was featured.

175
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:23,962
l get the hang of it.
ln the April issue.

176
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:27,756
No, Mr Silly. February!
My name is April.

177
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:32,159
Don't tell me. Your favourite movies are
The Sound of Music and Yes, Giorgio.

178
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:34,158
You love to go bobbing for apples.

179
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:36,522
Your major turn-offs are...

180
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:40,486
anchovies, people
who don't use coasters and--

181
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:44,196
And men who smoke in public places.

182
00:12:45,447 --> 00:12:47,278
Let's go meet Jerry.

183
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:59,477
There's Jerry over there.

184
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:10,442
l'm gonna have a place
like this someday.

185
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,677
Dream on, Streebek, dream on.

186
00:13:19,447 --> 00:13:21,324
lt's about time.

187
00:13:21,407 --> 00:13:23,523
l called you cops three hours ago.

188
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:26,485
Yes, sir. My name's Friday.
This is Detective Streebek.

189
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:28,640
What's missing?

190
00:13:28,727 --> 00:13:31,116
How about the entire run...

191
00:13:31,207 --> 00:13:34,882
every single copy of our
25th Anniversary double issue of Bait.

192
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:38,395
- Bait.
- That's his skin magazine.

193
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:42,321
You say.
The intelligent subscriber regards it...

194
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:45,205
as a politically-oriented,
socially-impacted monthly.

195
00:13:45,287 --> 00:13:48,882
l'm not gonna allow a gang
of cement heads to intimidate me...

196
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:51,162
just because l refused to publish
their stupid manifesto.

197
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:55,559
- Tell us about that.
- Here. Read it for yourself.

198
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:59,483
''Manifest of the lnternational
Brotherhood of Pagan.

199
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:03,355
We believe bad sex and good drugs are
the cornerstone of a great democracy.

200
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:06,757
- The peak of pornography--"
- We get the general idea.

201
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,681
My publishing company is not a
private platform for a bunch of yahoos.

202
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,156
l don't care how many copies
they buy.

203
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:16,796
l don't have to publish their junk just
because they got 1st amendment rights.

204
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:19,003
l've got 1st amendment rights, too.
Look 'em up.

205
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:21,555
l don't have.
l can quote 'em to you.

206
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:25,037
Anyhow, how much do you figure
a monthly run of your...

207
00:14:25,127 --> 00:14:27,004
''magazine'' is worth?

208
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:32,557
lt's more money than you'll ever see
in your life. And l do that every month.

209
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:34,046
My money's clean.

210
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:38,245
l'll tell you what you do before you go
home and start polishing your pennies.

211
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:41,444
Go out and get my magazines
back on the stand where they belong.

212
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:46,157
Listen, hotshot, l don't care for you or
the putrid sludge you're trowelling out.

213
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:50,638
But until the laws are changed,
my job's to get back your boxes of smut.

214
00:14:50,727 --> 00:14:53,036
Since l'll be doing it holding my nose,
l'll be doing it with one hand.

215
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:58,284
Excuse me. Jerry, it's time
for your collagen treatment.

216
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:01,279
And don't forget, you're having
your pores sucked at 3:00.

217
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:03,806
Thank you, Sylvia.

218
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:06,242
Boys, as you can see,
l've got my work to do.

219
00:15:06,327 --> 00:15:09,399
Why don't you get the hell out of here
and do yours?

220
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,756
You have very strong hands.

221
00:15:17,847 --> 00:15:20,042
Hey, Sylvia Wiss!

222
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:22,726
Yes, that's me.

223
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:25,560
They oughta transfer you to
Missing Persons. You know everybody.

224
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:30,437
Don't you read the papers? Saturday is
Bait magazine's 25th anniversary party.

225
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:33,599
Caesar is reuniting all
of his former Baitmates.

226
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:38,602
Miss Sylvia Wiss, right here,
was the very first Baitmate ever.

227
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,040
Fascinating.

228
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:44,757
Sergeant, if l asked your honest opinion
about something, would l get it?

229
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:46,724
You can bet the house on it.

230
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,520
Would you say these look like
the breasts of a 43-year-old woman?

231
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:56,959
No. No, they don't, Miss Wiss.

232
00:15:57,047 --> 00:16:00,323
They're quite impressive,
bordering on spectacular.

233
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:02,238
We have to be running along now.

234
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:04,636
What's your hurry?

235
00:16:04,727 --> 00:16:07,241
Wouldn't you like to have
an early lunch?

236
00:16:08,407 --> 00:16:10,796
Listen, Joe,
it's the darndest thing.

237
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:14,243
l seem to have
left my notebook in the car.

238
00:16:14,327 --> 00:16:18,036
lt's gonna take me 15, 20 min--
A half an hour to find it.

239
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:22,723
Why don't you pump Sylvia privately
for information?

240
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:24,763
And l'll, you know--

241
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:28,476
- Nice meeting you, Miss Wiss.
- l had a good time, too.

242
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:32,003
Come on. Let's go to the car
and find that notebook.

243
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,198
Are you crazy?

244
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,118
Sylvia Wiss wanted you.

245
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:40,198
Let me tell you something.

246
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:43,518
There are two things which differentiate
the human species from animals.

247
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:47,202
One, we use cutlery.
Two, we can control our sexual urges.

248
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:51,599
You might be an exception, but don't
drag me into your private hell.

249
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:56,245
You've got a lot
of repressed feelings, don't you?

250
00:16:56,327 --> 00:16:59,080
Must be what keeps your hair up.

251
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:13,040
- What is bothering you besides me?
- l'm thinking about those Pagans.

252
00:17:13,127 --> 00:17:17,040
lf all they were after was revenge
against Caesar, it's slime versus slime.

253
00:17:17,127 --> 00:17:21,643
But when they attack great institutions
like our city zoo, my hackles turn red.

254
00:17:21,727 --> 00:17:24,958
You'll lose those red hackles
if you eat those chili dogs.

255
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:26,560
l can handle it.

256
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:30,276
They're the worst thing for you.
Filled with nitrates, toxins, poisons.

257
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,198
And you're doubling up on them.

258
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:36,041
Mister, outside of cigarettes
l only have one vice: chili dogs.

259
00:17:36,127 --> 00:17:38,960
So pipe down and let me
enjoy my lunch in peace.

260
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:42,517
Do you know the things that can fall
into an industrial sausage press...

261
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:46,043
not excluding rodent hairs
and bug excrement?

262
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:48,118
l hate you, Streebek.

263
00:17:57,087 --> 00:18:01,399
Except for you and canned cling peaches,
l'd be hard-pressed to find anyone...

264
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:04,081
that doesn't know you should never leave
your car keys in the ignition.

265
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,318
lt's called a mistake. But l don't
suppose you ever make any of those.

266
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:09,682
At ease, Streebek.
We got another one.

267
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:12,201
Chemical train hijack
at the freight yards.

268
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:14,755
Damn Pagans must be living on No-Doz.

269
00:18:14,847 --> 00:18:17,077
Yes, sir. We'll roll
as soon as we requisition a new--

270
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:20,443
One more thing.
Police and fire departments...

271
00:18:20,527 --> 00:18:24,281
have been reporting vehicles stolen,
so keep an eye on your car.

272
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:32,998
[ Friday ]
1:15 p.m. After requisitioning
a replacement vehicle...

273
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,601
we were issued
a new Ford Escort subcompact...

274
00:18:35,687 --> 00:18:40,477
and responded to the call at Southern
California's largest railhead...

275
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:44,116
with more than 1,000 miles of track
lying parallel over 2 million ties...

276
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,084
hewn from majestic redwood forests.

277
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:50,723
3,000 gallons of two deadly chemicals
had been siphoned individually...

278
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:53,719
from their respective
hijacked tanker cars.

279
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:57,083
We questioned the battered
train engineer, Señor Tito Provencal...

280
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:00,603
and attempted to determine the precise
identification of the missing gases...

281
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:04,236
from the owner of the
chemicals company, a Mr Roy Grest.

282
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:09,082
Actually trichlornitromethan
and the pseudo-halogenic cyanogen.

283
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,123
Pseudo-halogenic cyanogen.

284
00:19:11,207 --> 00:19:14,722
They're shipped in separate containers.
Mixed properly in the exact ratio...

285
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:17,958
they form a liquid fertilizer
that's clear as water.

286
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:20,277
- But you wouldn't want to smell it.
- Why is that?

287
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,518
lt burns the eyes, lungs, and throat,
causes vomiting...

288
00:19:23,607 --> 00:19:25,802
and if continuously inhaled, death.

289
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:28,242
Sort of like your aftershave.

290
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:42,604
[ Announcer ] lt's time to ''Advance''
with the Reverend Jonathan Whirley...

291
00:19:42,687 --> 00:19:46,839
founder of MAMA,
the Moral Advance Movement of America.

292
00:19:46,927 --> 00:19:51,762
Today, Dr Whirley's special guest is
police commissioner for Los Angeles...

293
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:54,281
Ms. Jane Kirkpatrick.

294
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,801
Dr Whirley.

295
00:19:56,887 --> 00:20:01,085
Thank you, George,
and welcome once again to Advance.

296
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,361
Commissioner--

297
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:05,915
Please, will you call me Jane?

298
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:09,716
Only if you call me Jonathan.
[ Chuckling ]

299
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:12,605
Have you seen this guy?
What a mental fur ball.

300
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:14,996
Happens to be one of my favourite shows.

301
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:16,964
Why don't you listen and learn?

302
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:21,837
What a deep honour it is for this city
that you have chosen Los Angeles...

303
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:26,159
to be the new focal point for
the Moral Advance Movement of America.

304
00:20:26,247 --> 00:20:30,206
lt's quite simple, Jane.

305
00:20:30,287 --> 00:20:33,324
lf one wishes to effect a financial
upheaval in this country...

306
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,796
one should set his or her sights
on Wall Street.

307
00:20:35,887 --> 00:20:39,436
lf one wishes to revolutionize
the political system...

308
00:20:39,527 --> 00:20:42,405
he or she would naturally
go to Washington.

309
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:45,923
But when dealing...

310
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:49,124
with pornography, filth, crime...

311
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,277
degradation...

312
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:54,803
what better place is there to begin with
than Los Angeles...

313
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:58,235
the current capital of depravity...

314
00:20:58,327 --> 00:21:01,842
in what sadly passes
for the modern world.

315
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:12,800
[ Friday ]
2:15 p.m.

316
00:21:12,887 --> 00:21:17,324
We had been advised to follow up on
a theft at 8823467 Magnolia Boulevard.

317
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:19,602
At this time of day,
it took us 20 minutes to get there.

318
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:21,598
The complainant was the landlady,
Enid Borden.

319
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:23,678
Some Pagan cards had been found.

320
00:21:28,727 --> 00:21:31,321
- What the hell do you want?
- Police officers, ma'am.

321
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:33,398
About time you pencil dicks showed up.

322
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:35,842
Why couldn't you have gotten here
before that big, bad...

323
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:39,283
stupid-looking piece of sewage breath
stole my wedding dress?

324
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:41,927
Sewage breath would be
your nickname for--

325
00:21:42,007 --> 00:21:43,486
Muzz. Emil Muzz.

326
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:45,762
Not much of an improvement.

327
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:51,001
That ass-wipe also stiffed me for two
months' rent when his cheque bounced.

328
00:21:51,087 --> 00:21:53,157
Goddam puss-faced pimp stick.

01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:01,276
Well, allow me.
The place of honour for Granny.

831
01:01:01,367 --> 01:01:03,597
- Thank you.
- Certainly.

832
01:01:06,047 --> 01:01:08,607
And if l may, a toast.

833
01:01:08,687 --> 01:01:10,086
To Granny Mundy.

834
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:13,239
May you live as long as you want
but never want as long as you live.

835
01:01:15,167 --> 01:01:16,566
Hear! Hear!

836
01:01:19,807 --> 01:01:22,275
Ahhh.

837
01:01:22,367 --> 01:01:24,517
This is such a happy restaurant.

838
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:27,485
Commissioner Kirkpatrick,
how nice to see you again.

839
01:01:27,567 --> 01:01:29,956
Reverend Whirley,
it's a privilege.

840
01:01:32,047 --> 01:01:33,878
An aperitif, perhaps?

841
01:01:33,967 --> 01:01:37,164
l once saw Alan Hale, Jr. in here.

842
01:01:37,247 --> 01:01:40,637
Alan Hale, Jr.! Wow!
''Gilligan, little buddy!''

843
01:01:40,727 --> 01:01:45,323
Don't order anything more expensive than
the Cobb salad. That is an order.

844
01:01:45,407 --> 01:01:48,046
Oh, my God!

845
01:01:48,127 --> 01:01:50,436
- Connie?
- That's him.

846
01:01:50,527 --> 01:01:52,597
That man with the collar.

847
01:01:52,687 --> 01:01:54,518
The Reverend Whirley?

848
01:01:54,607 --> 01:01:57,963
He's the one who kidnapped me
and threw me in that pit...

849
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,117
with that horrible snake.

850
01:02:01,207 --> 01:02:04,040
l'll never forget his face
as long as l live.

851
01:02:04,127 --> 01:02:06,641
You have to be sure about this.

852
01:02:06,727 --> 01:02:09,480
How about very, very sure?

853
01:02:09,567 --> 01:02:11,842
l'm positive, Joe.

854
01:02:11,927 --> 01:02:13,724
That's him.

855
01:02:13,807 --> 01:02:15,684
The face behind the mask.

856
01:02:17,247 --> 01:02:19,715
The man who tried to kill me.

857
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:25,879
Would you testify to that under oath
in a court of law?

858
01:02:25,967 --> 01:02:28,606
Wait a minute. Settle down.

859
01:02:28,687 --> 01:02:31,838
Let's think about this.
That is Jonathan Whirley.

860
01:02:31,927 --> 01:02:35,078
Head of the Moral Advance Movement
of America. He's a public hero.

861
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:38,842
- You can't just walk up to him--
- Streebek.

862
01:02:38,927 --> 01:02:40,997
Vermin aren't allowed
inside restaurants.

863
01:02:41,087 --> 01:02:43,157
l'll be enforcing
the public health code.

864
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,997
lf you'll both excuse me...

865
01:02:47,087 --> 01:02:50,443
l'm afraid
the second-highest duty calls.

866
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:58,877
Joe, he is sitting with the commissioner
and our captain.

867
01:02:58,967 --> 01:03:02,277
Bust him now, tomorrow you'll
be mucking out stalls at Horse Patrol.

868
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,680
Thank you.

869
01:03:12,647 --> 01:03:14,000
l am sorry.

870
01:03:14,087 --> 01:03:16,920
Hold it there, Whirley. Police Officer.
You're under arrest.

871
01:03:17,007 --> 01:03:19,316
l beg your pardon?
ls this some sort of feeble joke?

872
01:03:19,407 --> 01:03:24,845
Oh, it's a knee-slapper, if you consider
Penal Codes 484207 A597 and 217...

873
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:27,600
theft, kidnapping, cruelty to animals,
attempted murder things to laugh about.

874
01:03:27,727 --> 01:03:30,082
l don't know
what you're talking about.

875
01:03:30,167 --> 01:03:32,840
My partner and l witnessed
that torchlight picnic you threw.

876
01:03:32,927 --> 01:03:36,442
We're gonna put you where your kind
always ends up: in a 7-by-7 cage...

877
01:03:36,527 --> 01:03:40,679
in some hundred-year-old penitentiary
with a wooden plank for a bed.

878
01:03:40,767 --> 01:03:44,077
Sure, this city isn't perfect. We need
a smut-free life for all our citizens.

879
01:03:44,167 --> 01:03:46,362
Cleaner streets, better schools,
a good hockey team.

880
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:50,281
But the difference between you and me is
you made the promise, l'm gonna keep it.

881
01:04:03,687 --> 01:04:07,441
Our good reverend's an amazing
piece of work, isn't he, Jane?

882
01:04:07,527 --> 01:04:10,485
- May l call you Jane?
- No.

883
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:20,237
Captain, Commissioner...

884
01:04:20,327 --> 01:04:23,239
l demand an immediate explanation
for this outrageous behaviour.

885
01:04:23,327 --> 01:04:25,363
lt's him again.

886
01:04:25,447 --> 01:04:27,756
Are you insane?

887
01:04:27,847 --> 01:04:31,442
Reverend Whirley abducted that girl,
had his men throw her in a pit...

888
01:04:31,527 --> 01:04:34,280
filled with polluted water
and a giant Bolivian jungle snake.

889
01:04:34,367 --> 01:04:36,927
These accusations are preposterous!

890
01:04:37,007 --> 01:04:40,636
l beg to differ. Ask him if he remembers
3,000 gallons of stolen...

891
01:04:40,727 --> 01:04:43,605
trichlornitromethane and the
pseudo-halogenic compound cyanogen...

892
01:04:43,687 --> 01:04:45,723
which, when mixed properly,
form a liquid fertilizer that burns...

893
01:04:45,807 --> 01:04:49,197
the throat, eyes, lungs, and nose,
and could cause vomiting and death.

894
01:04:49,287 --> 01:04:51,926
We're just about to eat here!

895
01:04:52,007 --> 01:04:55,682
Reverend Whirley, please accept
our most sincere apologies.

896
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:58,804
Sergeant, you will remove
those handcuffs immediately.

897
01:04:58,887 --> 01:05:01,640
Then you will hand in your badge.
You are relieved from duty.

898
01:05:01,727 --> 01:05:03,206
But-- But--
But, Commissioner--

899
01:05:03,287 --> 01:05:04,720
Now!

900
01:05:06,647 --> 01:05:08,683
Yes, sir. Ma'am.

901
01:05:08,767 --> 01:05:11,884
l don't care.
l'm absolutely humiliated.

902
01:05:11,967 --> 01:05:15,846
l know the young man was overzealous,
but he springs from a great tradition.

903
01:05:15,927 --> 01:05:19,078
Commissioner, won't you please
change your mind?

904
01:05:30,567 --> 01:05:34,003
l'm afraid l'll have to take
your badge and gun.

905
01:05:34,087 --> 01:05:37,966
- lf we could just please--
- l don't want to discuss it!

906
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,561
Just hand them over.

907
01:06:09,407 --> 01:06:14,242
Look, Joe, don't worry. l'm still
on active duty. l'm building a case.

908
01:06:14,327 --> 01:06:16,522
You're building nothin'.

909
01:06:16,607 --> 01:06:20,600
lf l ever hear you've come
within one mile of Reverend Whirley...

910
01:06:20,687 --> 01:06:22,598
l'll have your badge for breakfast!

911
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:25,679
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

912
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:37,360
lt was very nice of you to try
and take us out to dinner, Joe.

913
01:06:37,447 --> 01:06:41,042
Yeah. Thanks, Joe, for everything.

914
01:06:42,727 --> 01:06:47,437
Let's not stand around here moping.
l'm hungry! Let's go for chili dogs.

915
01:06:47,527 --> 01:06:52,647
Granny, have you ever eaten a chili dog
off the back of a motorcycle?

916
01:06:52,727 --> 01:06:54,558
Not till now.

917
01:06:54,647 --> 01:06:57,957
You smooth-talking son of a gun.

918
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:10,405
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

919
01:07:15,287 --> 01:07:17,960
l'm very sorry
you lost your job, Joe.

920
01:07:18,047 --> 01:07:20,242
l really did have
a very good time.

921
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:22,443
l'm glad, Connie.

922
01:07:22,527 --> 01:07:25,439
Now, fasten your seat belt.
l can still effect a citizen's arrest.

923
01:07:25,527 --> 01:07:28,724
l don't want to ruin a wonderful evening
by bringing you in on a misdemeanour.

924
01:07:30,007 --> 01:07:31,759
That was a joke.

925
01:07:32,847 --> 01:07:35,077
Oh.

926
01:07:49,167 --> 01:07:51,283
Oh, Joe!

927
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:53,278
Look at the stars!

928
01:07:53,367 --> 01:07:55,437
Dozens of them.

929
01:07:57,727 --> 01:08:01,766
You know, when l was a little girl...

930
01:08:01,847 --> 01:08:04,680
l used to wish upon
a different star every night...

931
01:08:04,767 --> 01:08:08,043
for that special someone to come along.

932
01:08:08,127 --> 01:08:10,641
Someone with whom
l could share...

933
01:08:12,647 --> 01:08:14,638
everything.

934
01:08:19,007 --> 01:08:21,316
l guess that's not so unusual.

935
01:08:22,207 --> 01:08:25,643
All girls do that, don't they, Joe?

936
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:28,241
Some guys do, too, Connie.

937
01:08:31,887 --> 01:08:34,162
- Joe?
- That's me.

938
01:08:35,687 --> 01:08:37,518
Was there ever...

939
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:41,520
anyone else?

940
01:08:41,607 --> 01:08:43,359
Of course there was.

941
01:08:44,567 --> 01:08:46,319
Oh.

942
01:08:46,407 --> 01:08:50,082
Actually, l've only been driving
with Streebek a couple of days.

943
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:53,284
- Before that l was with Frank.
- That's not what l meant.

944
01:09:13,687 --> 01:09:17,839
- [ Banging ]
- [ Screaming ]

945
01:09:17,927 --> 01:09:20,646
Goodness! Earthquake! lt's the big one!

946
01:09:20,727 --> 01:09:22,957
Joe, help!

947
01:09:23,047 --> 01:09:24,605
Request Code 3.
Officer in distress.

948
01:09:24,687 --> 01:09:27,360
Assist officer.
l'll handle this. Calm down.

949
01:09:29,367 --> 01:09:32,996
- [ Gasping ]
- [ Shotgun Pump Clicking ]

950
01:09:33,247 --> 01:09:35,886
January 9, 8:37 a.m.

951
01:09:35,967 --> 01:09:38,561
My name's Streebek.
l'm a cop.

952
01:09:38,647 --> 01:09:40,000
l overslept.

953
01:09:42,167 --> 01:09:46,638
Curiously enough, l still hadn't heard
from my anal-retentive ex-partner...

954
01:09:46,727 --> 01:09:49,844
although l was sure he'd be proud to
know l was making a concerted effort...

955
01:09:49,927 --> 01:09:52,202
to personally develop
a close relationship...

956
01:09:52,287 --> 01:09:55,518
with one of my sisters
in the Los Angeles Police Department.

957
01:10:17,167 --> 01:10:19,727
l placed a call
to the virgin Connie Swail...

958
01:10:19,807 --> 01:10:22,844
but according to the girl's mother,
she hadn't come home either.

959
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,646
l don't know what to say, Mrs. Swail.

960
01:10:25,727 --> 01:10:28,241
l'm beginning to be concerned myself.

961
01:10:28,327 --> 01:10:32,115
No, Joe Friday has never
stayed out all night, either.

962
01:10:32,207 --> 01:10:35,677
The day he was born,
his mother had him home by 9:00.

963
01:10:35,767 --> 01:10:39,680
Well, let's both stay in touch
in case we hear from them.

964
01:10:39,767 --> 01:10:41,723
Thank you, Mrs. Swail.

965
01:10:44,767 --> 01:10:47,565
Oh, my goodness.
l'm gonna be late for my stake-out.

966
01:10:48,687 --> 01:10:50,598
As enchanting as Robin was...

967
01:10:50,687 --> 01:10:54,521
l still couldn't get my mind off
what happened to Joe Friday.

968
01:10:54,607 --> 01:10:56,802
For one misguided moment...

969
01:10:56,887 --> 01:11:00,084
l actually pictured my ex-partner
introducing that little cupcake...

970
01:11:00,167 --> 01:11:04,001
to the one piece of equipment that
wasn't issued to him by the department.

971
01:11:04,087 --> 01:11:08,524
But then l realized Joe would never
spring for the price of a motel room.

972
01:11:08,607 --> 01:11:12,043
And since having sex in a Yugo
was a logistical impossibility...

973
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:15,199
l came to the conclusion
that something must be wrong.

974
01:11:15,287 --> 01:11:16,879
Who cares?

975
01:11:16,967 --> 01:11:18,764
Listen to me, Captain.

976
01:11:18,847 --> 01:11:21,805
Joe Friday was the most dedicated cop
in this city.

977
01:11:21,887 --> 01:11:24,720
Okay, so maybe all his dogs
aren't attached to one leash.

978
01:11:24,807 --> 01:11:27,321
He's thickheaded, insensitive
and reactionary.

979
01:11:27,407 --> 01:11:30,797
And generally less fun to be around
than any person l've ever met.

980
01:11:30,887 --> 01:11:33,606
Still, he was my partner.

981
01:11:33,687 --> 01:11:36,042
You want to find Joe Friday?

982
01:11:36,127 --> 01:11:40,040
My advice is to start checking out
the sanitariums.

983
01:11:41,647 --> 01:11:43,478
- Hey, Pep.
- What's shaking?

984
01:11:43,567 --> 01:11:45,842
- Hey, you!
- Me, Pep?

985
01:11:46,887 --> 01:11:49,196
Detective Streebek to you.
Let's get this mop trimmed.

986
01:11:49,287 --> 01:11:51,278
Stop shaving with a pocketknife,
and next time you eat your lunch...

987
01:11:51,367 --> 01:11:53,198
put it in your stomach,
not on your uniform.

988
01:11:53,287 --> 01:11:56,006
You're a disgrace to this department
and that badge.

989
01:12:11,367 --> 01:12:13,278
You're late, Jerry.

990
01:12:14,887 --> 01:12:19,438
l saw your announcement about my
so-called million-dollar contribution.

991
01:12:19,527 --> 01:12:21,518
Do yourself a favour, friend.

992
01:12:22,767 --> 01:12:24,246
Try the lottery.

993
01:12:24,327 --> 01:12:26,204
The lottery l can fix.

994
01:12:26,287 --> 01:12:28,482
Our problem is Mayor Parvin.

995
01:12:28,567 --> 01:12:32,640
l'm afraid he is not
''going gentle into that good night.''

996
01:12:32,727 --> 01:12:34,080
Say what?

997
01:12:34,167 --> 01:12:38,046
That he is not responding
to our pressure to resign.

998
01:12:38,127 --> 01:12:40,687
We're gonna have to push him
over the edge.

999
01:12:40,767 --> 01:12:44,840
Your million-dollar contribution
will insure his presence at your party.

1000
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:49,364
Just make sure he turns into
a drug-crazed idiot, with pictures.

1001
01:12:49,447 --> 01:12:52,086
Once he's politically dead,
Commissioner Kirkpatrick...

1002
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:54,442
will be a shoo-in to replace him
in the next election.

1003
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:57,837
You and l will split control
of the city.

1004
01:12:57,927 --> 01:12:59,997
You will monopolize all pornography.

1005
01:13:00,087 --> 01:13:03,602
Half the poor dumb sheep in Los Angeles
will be forking over money...

1006
01:13:03,687 --> 01:13:05,643
to buy your sleaze...

1007
01:13:05,727 --> 01:13:08,400
while the other half will be funding me
with the means to fight it.

1008
01:13:09,847 --> 01:13:11,200
Reverend...

1009
01:13:12,327 --> 01:13:14,795
you got balls as big as church bells.

1010
01:13:16,327 --> 01:13:17,806
Thank you.

1011
01:13:33,927 --> 01:13:37,522
Jonathan, l do not trust that man.

1012
01:13:37,607 --> 01:13:40,405
Thank goodness he trusts me.

1013
01:13:40,487 --> 01:13:42,682
That socially-retarded hedonist...

1014
01:13:42,767 --> 01:13:46,077
actually believes he's going
to be alive tomorrow.

1015
01:14:21,767 --> 01:14:23,359
Where's Joe Friday?

1016
01:14:36,447 --> 01:14:37,800
lt's no use.

1017
01:14:37,887 --> 01:14:39,718
These knots are too tight.

1018
01:14:39,807 --> 01:14:42,275
Untie the girl.
She's coming with me.

1019
01:14:44,807 --> 01:14:48,880
You hypocrite. lf you were decent,
you'd let her go and kill me instead.

1020
01:14:48,967 --> 01:14:50,320
lnstead?

1021
01:14:51,647 --> 01:14:56,516
But, my dear Sergeant Friday,
l'd always planned on killing you.

1022
01:14:56,607 --> 01:14:59,167
How do you see yourself
going down in history?

1023
01:14:59,247 --> 01:15:01,477
Pagan or reverend,
devil or angel?

1024
01:15:01,567 --> 01:15:04,764
Why, both, of course.

1025
01:15:04,847 --> 01:15:07,077
One can't exist without the other.

1026
01:15:07,167 --> 01:15:09,920
Without the Jerry Caesars,
there'd be no moral outrage.

1027
01:15:10,007 --> 01:15:12,077
What's the good of moral outrage...

1028
01:15:12,167 --> 01:15:15,239
unless you have something tangible
to direct it against?

1029
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:17,887
By this time tomorrow,
thanks to that poison gas...

1030
01:15:17,967 --> 01:15:20,561
you've been tracking
like some flu-ridden bloodhound...

1031
01:15:20,647 --> 01:15:24,401
Mr Caesar will be sitting
in that big Jacuzzi in the sky...

1032
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:26,796
and l'll control both sides
of the equation.

1033
01:15:26,887 --> 01:15:30,163
Sure, but like every other psycho
in this city with a foolproof plan...

1034
01:15:30,247 --> 01:15:33,000
you've forgotten you're facing the
finest fighting force ever assembled.

1035
01:15:34,407 --> 01:15:35,760
The lsraelis?

1036
01:15:35,847 --> 01:15:38,486
Try the decent, hardworking
men and women of Los Angeles.

1037
01:15:40,487 --> 01:15:42,682
Forgotten about them?

1038
01:15:42,767 --> 01:15:44,883
My dear Sergeant...

1039
01:15:44,967 --> 01:15:48,277
l'm absolutely counting on them.

1040
01:15:50,607 --> 01:15:52,484
- Joe.
- [ Whirley Laughs ]

1041
01:15:52,567 --> 01:15:54,637
Joe?

1042
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:32,319
[ Friday ]
You may have taken a wrong turn,
but there's time to straighten out.

1043
01:16:32,407 --> 01:16:34,602
You're the one that's gonna
straighten out, cop...

1044
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,518
all the way down the mountain.

1045
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:42,120
Let's go, Streebek.

1046
01:17:10,647 --> 01:17:13,115
Just relax and hold on tight.

1047
01:17:13,207 --> 01:17:16,404
Tighter!
Pretend l'm Connie. Ooh!

1048
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:19,919
Look out! Look out!

1049
01:17:24,447 --> 01:17:26,961
There's no road here.

1050
01:17:29,087 --> 01:17:31,442
No road. Look out!

1051
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:45,483
Look, there's the mayor.

1052
01:17:45,567 --> 01:17:48,320
Pretty clever of Whirley manoeuvring
him up here to Caesar's party.

1053
01:17:48,407 --> 01:17:50,557
He's got both people
he wants to eliminate in one place.

1054
01:17:50,647 --> 01:17:53,957
Hey, isn't that Whirley's car?

1055
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:56,356
Good evening, Reverend.

1056
01:17:56,447 --> 01:17:58,244
Child.

1057
01:17:58,327 --> 01:18:00,602
l don't see Connie.

1058
01:18:00,687 --> 01:18:04,885
- The next car comes, follow me in.
- Wait. You can't go in there.

1059
01:18:04,967 --> 01:18:08,243
- When did you become Miss Manners?
- First, you don't have a warrant.

1060
01:18:08,327 --> 01:18:11,603
Penal Code 836: A police officer
may make an arrest without a warrant...

1061
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,518
if he believes there's probable cause--

1062
01:18:13,607 --> 01:18:16,360
You're not a police officer any more.

1063
01:18:19,207 --> 01:18:21,846
l hate to be the one to break
that to you, but it's the truth.

1064
01:18:21,927 --> 01:18:24,725
You charge in there now,
you'll never get your badge back.

1065
01:18:24,807 --> 01:18:26,718
Whirley's the only one
that knows where Connie is.

1066
01:18:26,807 --> 01:18:29,002
He'll tell or l'll shove that collar
so far down his throat...

1067
01:18:29,087 --> 01:18:30,918
l'll have to take off his shoes
to wring his neck.

1068
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:34,841
You're not thinking like a cop any more.
You're thinking like a man in love.

1069
01:18:34,927 --> 01:18:37,441
Watch your language, mister!

1070
01:18:38,367 --> 01:18:40,517
Oh, Joe, l--

1071
01:18:40,607 --> 01:18:43,565
You've never had these feelings before,
have you?

1072
01:18:45,127 --> 01:18:46,958
Almost.

1073
01:18:47,047 --> 01:18:49,197
l had a kitten once.

1074
01:18:49,287 --> 01:18:52,723
This is gonna be a little different.
Connie won't be sleeping in a box...

1075
01:18:52,807 --> 01:18:56,516
or meowing all night
or climbing up your drapes.

1076
01:18:56,607 --> 01:19:01,044
Or maybe she will. You both are sort of
starting from scratch with this thing.

1077
01:19:01,127 --> 01:19:02,640
Get out of my way!

1078
01:19:02,727 --> 01:19:07,039
Last time you went after Whirley, you
got suspended. Now you'll get arrested.

1079
01:19:07,127 --> 01:19:12,042
- On what charge, Junior?
- How about Section 146-A?

That's right.

ln spite of every logical instinct
l've ever had...

1083

01:19:29,927 --> 01:19:32,236
- Wait.
- Joe, go home.

1085
01:19:32,327 --> 01:19:34,238
There's nothing more you can do here.
Believe me.

1086
01:19:34,327 --> 01:19:37,125
By the way, my name is Pep.

1087
01:19:38,407 --> 01:19:42,002
lt's not mister, junior,
bub or Streebek. lt's Pep.

You, too, Reverend.

1093
01:20:17,767 --> 01:20:21,282
Let's just drop the fake civility.
Okay, Caesar?

1094
01:20:21,367 --> 01:20:24,996
- You have a cheque for the Reverend.
- l do, all in due time.

1095

Well, whatever.
