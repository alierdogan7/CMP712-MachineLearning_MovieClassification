<i>Just give me the chance</i>

6
00:01:02,576 --> 00:01:04,976
<i>Case in point, Spanish homework</i>

7
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:10,178
''Dame un batido de esperma''
<i>does not mean ''take me to the airport ''</i>

8
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,651
<i>It means, ''give me a sperm milkshake ''</i>

9
00:01:15,322 --> 00:01:19,224
<i>And 22 kids gave that as an answer</i>
<i>in Spanish 3 last week</i>

10

<i>I'm not sure about the milkshake,</i>

Bobby Funke. l write for the paper.

20

You don't write for shit.

Sophomore.

24
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:08,668
Bobby, you can't expect us
to give you a story like this

25
00:02:08,742 --> 00:02:11,040
when there's nothing written
and there's hardly proof.

26
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:15,172
Look, Clara, l'm the best writer you've got.
Tell me differently.

27
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:18,140
You've never finished an article.

28
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:23,120
Well, then, do you want to go
to homecoming with me?

29
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,384
No.

<i>Friedrich Nietzsche said,</i>

33

l can't talk right now, Clara.

36
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,048
Look, l feel really bad about what happened.

37
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:50,878

-You know what Tad's short for, right?
-Theodore?

41
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,384
No. Vagina.

42
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:02,450

-Really?
-Really.

46
00:03:14,174 --> 00:03:15,402
Okay.

47
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:20,373

51

Come on, give me a piece of loose leaf.

52
00:03:37,998 --> 00:03:39,590
Give me a pen.

53
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,634
What happened to the last pen l gave you?

54
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:44,067
Give me a pen, Funke. Give me a pen.

55
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:45,695

Could you please state your name,
year and Social Security number?

66

Sophomore.

69

As president, how would you say
you are going to handle

70
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:58,740
the recent drop in ACT and SAT scores?

71
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,144
Well, what would you have me do about it?

72
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:10,546
Seriously, you've seen me on the boards.
l'll do whatever it takes it get it done.

<i>Paul was all length and no depth</i>

77
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,684
He didn't give you a whole lot?
How could he not give you a whole lot?

78
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,784
Look at the guy. People love him.

79
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:51,126

he's charismatic, he's good-looking,

80
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:53,097
he's a tenacious athlete.

81
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:56,499
l'm sorry, Tad. l didn't realize
you felt that way about him.

82
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:57,627
Sad.

-l don't know, Coach. l'm not feeling it.

Pauley! Ball game!

93
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:29,827
No one understands why you got
the Moore story instead of Tad Goltz.

94
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:32,371
l'm sure there's a lot
you don't understand, Tad.

Yeah? Well, l understand art when l see it.

96

-He does. Look at him.
-Looks like a stockbroker.

127

133
00:09:05,558 --> 00:09:09,426
Breathing hard. Riding you, like a horse.

134
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:12,389
No?

135
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:32,279
l assume you all know why you're here.

136
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:34,681
Let me guess.

137
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:37,279
You finally want to start that boy-band

Landis, do l come down to the strip club

This is why you're here! This!

144
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:02,914
That's sick.

145
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:04,415
You've got a gum problem

that's rapidly turning into
an attitude problem.

147
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,516
That's why you're here!

148
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:12,851

150
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,561
You are all filth.

151
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:25,568
Your parents have obviously spoiled you
or, in your case, possibly abused you,

152
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:27,763

153
00:10:29,842 --> 00:10:32,174
Now, one of you little vermin

Of this l am certain.

Because l will have the pleasure

158
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:54,656

two klicks east of the Tigris,
the birthplace of civilization.

Do you know what the Arabic word
<i>''la hariq''</i> means?

-No.
-lt means, ''Don't shoot.''

''Don't shoot!''

164
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,845

00:11:55,561 --> 00:12:00,225
So, what are you doing in the men's room?

169
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:06,094
Well, l thought l might find a man in here.
Are you a man, Funke?

170
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:16,511
l'm just screwing with you.

171
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:19,348
l just need your help.

172
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:21,618
With what?

173
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:25,748
Whoever stole the SATs.
l need you to find them and get them back.

174
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:31,386
l aced that thing, l know it.
l was just in the zone.

175
00:12:33,032 --> 00:12:35,557
Do you know what ''mastication'' means?

176
00:12:35,935 --> 00:12:39,029
-No.
-Me, neither. But in that moment, l did.

177
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:44,142
lt was perfect. l need you to find those tests.

178
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:47,406
Why me?

179
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:52,746
l don't know,
l've got a feeling about you, Funke.

180
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:55,117
This stuff's right up your alley.

181
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:06,394
So do you have any idea
who might have taken the SATs?

182
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:08,434
We took the SATs?

183
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:11,026
l didn't. l didn't.

184
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:12,870
Did you take them?

185
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:16,102
No, l didn't take them.
Everyone was in the classrooms.

186
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:19,110
That's what all the commotion was about.

187
00:13:21,114 --> 00:13:23,548
Okay, where were you last night?

188
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:30,218
That's where l was last night.

189
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,848
Hey, Funke. Funke, want a gumball?

190
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:04,181
lt's good. lt's soft. lt's sweet.

191
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:06,020
l'm not falling for the gumball trick, Cipriato,

192
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:08,720
so you can put your ballbag
back in your pants.

193
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:12,462
What's it like sucking on
another man's fingers?

194
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:14,124
What's it like stealing the SATs?

195
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,667
l asked you first.

196
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:22,074
-Where were you that night?
-What do you care?

197
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:24,041
l'm writing your biography.

198
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,307
Fine, let me copy off you
and l'll tell you.

199
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:28,912
Fine.

200
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:33,374
l was at the Park Arms with my nana,
playing bingo.

201
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:37,889
l got 30 fucking geriatrics
that can back that up.

202
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:41,286
l'm touched, Cipriato.

203
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,952
Not a word, Funke.

204
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:53,334
<i>After tailing Landis, I discovered</i>
<i>her secret life outside of school</i>

205
00:14:56,576 --> 00:15:00,740
<i>She opened up, once I promised</i>
<i>to keep her ice-capades under wraps</i>

206
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:05,941
l don't know who took them, Nancy Drew,
but l do know it happened during the game.

207
00:15:06,018 --> 00:15:08,543
l was out in the parking lot last night
and l saw some flashlight

208
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:11,317
bounce around in <i>K</i>irkpatrick's office.

209
00:15:11,724 --> 00:15:13,851
What were you doing in the parking lot?

210
00:15:13,926 --> 00:15:17,157
l was probably getting fingered
by Dutch Middleton.

211
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:22,297
Okay. Thanks, Landis.

212
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:24,662
Long time no see, Rocky.

213
00:15:24,737 --> 00:15:26,728
Weekends and holidays, man.

214
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:28,967
-Thanks.
-Did you do it?

215
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,303
No. You?

216
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:34,073
l wish. Those tests are the tool
of the racist bourgeoisie.

217
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:35,943
Back to your cage, butt-boy.

218
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:43,317
Last night? No, man.
l got picked up for possession,

219
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:47,450
spent the night in holding.
lt's the creepy. You know.

220
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,523
l was fucked up.

221
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:52,661
That's some alibi.

222
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:55,895
Fuck it, fuck it. Hold this.
This is my jam, man.

223
00:16:07,213 --> 00:16:09,943
<i>None of these bad apples</i>
<i>had stolen the tests</i>

224
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:13,884
<i>Their alibis were like Dutch ovens</i>
<i>Gamey, but airtight</i>

225
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:19,455
<i>Maybe I was looking at it all wrong</i>
<i>Maybe a good kid was behind it</i>

226
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:21,550
What scares you, Funke?

227
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:24,261
You know what scares me? lnjustice.

228
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,060
You know why? Because it's everywhere.

229
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:31,229
You think l don't see Cipriato
behind me jerking off right now?

230
00:16:31,304 --> 00:16:34,967
He's a dead man. l'll deal with him.

231
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:41,446
But the thing about fighting injustice
is choosing your battles wisely.

232
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:46,511
And my battle right now is to find out
where are my missing SATs.

233
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:51,855
Now, l don't know your involvement
in all this, Funke,

234
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:55,724
but l'm watching you.

235
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:59,489
l got both eyes open and they're on you.

236
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:02,325
-You read me?
-Yes. Yes.

237
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:04,995
You bleed, Funke. We all bleed.

238
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:07,834
Thank you, sir.

239
00:17:10,943 --> 00:17:14,276
Tad, am l going to get my story
on the girls' bowling team any time soon?

240
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:16,645
Get off my fucking back, Clara!

241
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:19,310
Nobody gives two shits about girls' bowling.

242
00:17:19,385 --> 00:17:21,376
l give two shits, okay?

243
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:23,854
How many more shits
do l need to get a story from you, Tad?

244
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:25,288
And Bobby?

245
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,286
Yeah?

246
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:32,093
Where's my story on Paul Moore?

247
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:39,334
<i>Paul was a good kid</i>
<i>Maybe his bum knee wasn't so bad</i>

248
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:41,999
<i>Maybe my puff piece was no pastry</i>

249
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:43,268
lt's on its way.

250
00:17:43,743 --> 00:17:45,643
So how long...

251
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:49,877
So how did Paul's knee look that night?

252
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,514
Okay. Why?

253
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:58,946
Well, because, Nurse Platt, Paul injured it.
That's why they brought him here.

254
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:02,961
l thought he had diarrhea.

255
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:08,462
But he was limping,
so l guess he did hurt his little stem.

256
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:10,728
Yeah.

257
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:14,032
Okay.

258
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:19,334
So were you... Were you here with him
in the office the whole time?

259
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:20,606
Yeah.

260
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:25,139
Well, except l got hungry, and Paul
said l should get something to eat.

261
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:26,343
His treat.

262
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:31,584
So, l went across the street and got a gyro
at that Greek place, Little Spyros.

263
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:36,120
Have you ever been there? lt's so good.

264
00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:39,826
Do you mean to tell me
that Paul was alone in here?

265
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:43,164
l mean, so good.

266
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:48,764
How long did you leave Paul
on his own that night?

267
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:53,210
Hey, D.

268
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:57,412
When l go get Greek food,
how long does it take me?

269
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,644
About 20 minutes. You know, more or less.

270
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:03,921
Hey, what's up, Frankie?

271
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:06,622
Look, just get me the sandwich.

272
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:09,525
Yeah, l want a foot-long
spicy ltalian sausage.

273
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:13,258
That's right. Yeah. l got one and l want one.

274
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:15,758
Yeah, see that's a double-entendre.

275
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:19,032
Yeah. That's right.
l coached English for two seasons.

276
00:19:19,104 --> 00:19:21,163
l got to go. l got to go.

277
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:25,871
All right, so where were we?

278
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:28,038
Paul Moore's college prospects.

279
00:19:28,113 --> 00:19:30,308
You know, grades have never been
Paul's strong suit.

280
00:19:30,382 --> 00:19:32,646
But, you know, if he wants to go lvy,
he'll get in.

281
00:19:32,718 --> 00:19:35,243
Believe me,
that boy will do whatever it takes to win.

282
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:38,449
That's PMW. That is the Paul Moore way.

283
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:40,890
P-Moore! P-Moore!

284
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:45,522
<i>The coach gave me Paul's motive</i>
<i>The nurse, opportunity</i>

285
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:47,623
<i>My gut said I had my guy</i>

286
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,330
<i>But on the way home, I realized I needed</i>
<i>an inside source to back it all up</i>

287
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,831
<i>I also needed to get my license</i>

288
00:19:56,909 --> 00:19:59,935
<i>Lately me and the DMV</i>
<i>weren't seeing eye-to-eye</i>

289
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:02,344
And when parking along a curb
on an uphill slope,

290
00:20:02,414 --> 00:20:04,939
we turn our wheels to the... Nope.

291
00:20:05,017 --> 00:20:08,885
And when there's a yellow light,
we approach the intersection at a nice...

292
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:10,849
Nope.

293
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:15,818
And when we come to an object
in the road, like a dog, we...

294
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:21,600
Nope.

295
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:25,869
<i>I was looking for corroboration on my story</i>

296
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:28,532
<i>Woodward and Bernstein</i>
<i>had their Deep Throat</i>

297
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:32,270
<i>I needed mine</i>
<i>Fortunately, I knew just the girl</i>

298
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:36,644
<i>She sounded hesitant on the phone,</i>
<i>but told me where I could find her</i>

299
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:41,042
Hey, Chrissy?

300
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:45,980
l'm a friend of your brother Paul.

301
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,490
No. No, you're not.

302
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:52,624
How do you know?

303
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,600
Okay.

304
00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:00,298
Well, has Paul ever taken you
to one of his games before?

305
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:03,307
You're a high-schooler
and you don't have a car?

306
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:06,068
Why don't you have a car?

307
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:08,503
That's irrelevant, Chrissy.

308
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:13,012
l want a unicorn.

309
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:16,880
Neat.

310
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:20,119
You know, when l was your age,
l wanted a pet giraffe.

311
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:23,753
Giraffes suck. Get me a unicorn,

312
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:28,493
and l'll tell you so many secrets about Paul.
Very secret secrets.

313
00:21:29,602 --> 00:21:35,063
Here's the thing, Chrissy,
unicorns don't actually exist.

314
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,938
A stuffed-animal unicorn, doofus!

315
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:54,148
<i>Chrissy Moore was one unicorn well spent</i>

316
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:59,426
<i>After she filled in the blanks,</i>
<i>my story was right there in front of me</i>

317
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:01,864
<i>But I still had no solid proof</i>

318
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:05,235
<i>Were my hunches enough</i>
<i>to write the article?</i>

319
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:11,904
<i>Fuck it Woodward and Bernstein</i>

320
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:16,643
Hey, l won't tell you again, Ongatumamwe!

321
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:18,808
This is P-Moore's shampoo!

322
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:22,684
l've got enough clout around here
to get your ass deported for less.

323
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:29,260
You fellows here for the cockfight?

324
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:49,979
This story's going to start, like,
a frigging coup d'etat on this bitch.

325
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:52,916
Thanks, man. l like your dreads.

326
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:06,162
Thanks.

327
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:13,104
l didn't do anything. l didn't do anything.

328
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:16,367
This is crazy. l didn't do anything.

329
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:20,635
Hey, l'm the president.
l'm the president. l'm Paul Moore.

330
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,442
l'm Paul Moore.

331
00:23:22,514 --> 00:23:24,607
l didn't do any... l didn't do anything.

332
00:23:24,683 --> 00:23:27,345
lt's all right. l didn't do anything.
Don't worry.

333
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,647
-Open it up.
-l didn't do...

334
00:23:29,722 --> 00:23:31,155
Open it up.

335
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,924
l don't... l don't know where those...

336
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:41,693
l don't know what those are.
Those aren't Paul Moore's!

337
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:43,166
l don't...

338
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:46,001
l don't know how those got...

339
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:47,402
Let's go.

340
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,072
Come on, Paul. Don't fight it.

341
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:53,873
This is crazy. l'm a patsy! l'm a patsy!

342
00:23:56,515 --> 00:23:59,211
''But in the end Paul Moore kept his promise.

343
00:23:59,284 --> 00:24:02,117
''He did whatever it took to get the job done.

344
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:06,556
''Even the unthinkable.
PMW. The Paul Moore way.''

345
00:24:07,593 --> 00:24:09,493
The name's Bobby Funke.

346
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:12,354
l write for the paper.

347
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:23,405
So l just want everyone to know
that l'm submitting this article

348
00:24:23,475 --> 00:24:27,104
to the Northwestern people
with my highest recommendation.

349
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:44,991
l wanted to thank you for finding the SATs.

350
00:24:45,464 --> 00:24:48,456
And for showing me
what a douche Paul really is.

351
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:53,536
See, the thing is, l seem to have lost
my date to homecoming,

352
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:55,766
and l wanted to know if you'd go with me.

353
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:57,706
You want to go to homecoming with me?

354
00:24:57,776 --> 00:24:58,936
Well, not like ''go'' go.

355
00:24:59,011 --> 00:25:00,205
-l mean, not like for real.
-Yeah.

356
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:02,304
lt's just everyone already has a date.

357
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:03,541
-Right.
-Except for the mathletes

358
00:25:03,615 --> 00:25:07,051
and maybe that wrestler
with the jock itch on his face.

359
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,381
So yeah...

360
00:25:08,754 --> 00:25:11,382
The only person l can go with is you.

361
00:25:12,324 --> 00:25:15,782
l still don't see why you wanna go with me.

362
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:19,128
Yeah, why not? l mean,
you're like the school's Wolf Blitzer now.

363
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:23,931
Wolf Blitzer's like a TV reporter.
l'm into Woodward and Bernstein.

364
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:26,360
You already have a date?

365
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:28,706
What? No. l just...

366
00:25:29,575 --> 00:25:32,339
Great. Then you can pick me up at 8:00.

367
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:36,275
And no wrist corsages.
Get the kind with the pin.

368
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:39,579
l don't mind a little prick
every once in a while.

369
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,281
St. Donovan's, good morning.
This is your principal, Mr. <i>K</i>irkpatrick.

370
00:25:45,357 --> 00:25:48,986
As you know, there's been
a regime change here at the school,

371
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:50,551
and your new president,

372
00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:53,564
-Marlon Paizza, is gonna say a few words...
-Piazza.

373
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:55,429
-What?
-Marlon Piazza.

374
00:25:56,268 --> 00:25:58,759
<i>-What's that? Italian?</i>
<i>-I think so</i>

375
00:25:58,837 --> 00:26:02,500
<i>Marlon Piazza is going to say</i>
<i>a few words to you Stand by</i>

376
00:26:02,574 --> 00:26:05,372
You're on the air. No effing around, huh?

377
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:09,113
Thank you, sir. Fellow students,

378
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:13,507
this has been a difficult time for all of us.

379
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:16,750
<i>But do not lose faith in this institution,</i>

380
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:20,758
<i>because from great tragedy</i>
<i>comes great triumph</i>

381
00:26:21,226 --> 00:26:25,686
<i>Let me be the first to say</i>
<i>that the actions of your ex-president</i>

382
00:26:33,272 --> 00:26:34,671
lt's open.

383
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:51,883
Hey, Marlon.

384
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:16,136
So is it true that she got
a perfect score on her SATs?

385
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:20,583
Yeah, her freshman year.
l'll let you play with her tits for 20 bucks.

386
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:27,421
Hey, Funke. You're good.

387
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,221
lt's a nice place you got here.

388
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:34,254
Have a good look while you can.
l doubt you'll be coming by again.

389
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,516
l guess that l should congratulate you
on your new presidency.

390
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:54,848
lsn't it funny how someone can be
your average cakewalk VP one day

391
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,911
and then head of the school the next?

392
00:27:56,989 --> 00:28:00,925
Yeah. lt's like how someone
can be the school joke one day

393
00:28:00,993 --> 00:28:04,451
and then go to homecoming with
the hottest girl at St. Donovan's the next.

394
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:06,053
She's, like, your half-sister, right?

395
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:07,621
Step-sister.

396
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:10,633
Hey, Funke.

397
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:13,398
Hey, Francesca.

398
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:19,867
Wow, you look awesome.

399
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:22,477
Thanks.

400
00:28:22,547 --> 00:28:24,845
You look pretty good yourself.

401
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,983
Like your shoes.

402
00:28:27,052 --> 00:28:30,749
She doesn't have to go
to the hospital again, does she?

403
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:34,315
ls your car out front?

404
00:28:34,393 --> 00:28:38,090
Well, it's such a nice night,
l thought that we could walk.

405
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:07,815
Sorry about that. l just can't seem
to get away from my friends sometimes.

406
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:11,288
Yeah. l know what you mean.

407
00:29:12,497 --> 00:29:14,590
You still want that dance?

408
00:29:17,903 --> 00:29:20,133
Quantum physics is bullshit!

409
00:29:20,205 --> 00:29:23,572
Yeah. You don't know
what is inside of a black hole

410
00:29:23,642 --> 00:29:26,941
because, you know, stuff goes in

411
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:30,347
but nothing comes out.

412
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,915
Just like Laura Hoffner's box.

413
00:29:58,944 --> 00:30:01,378
You think l'm a bitch, don't you?

414
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:04,982
l mean, you can be honest.
l don't care either way.

415
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,542
l'm just curious. Do you think l'm a bitch?

416
00:30:13,692 --> 00:30:15,751
-<i>K</i>ind of.
-Seriously?

417
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:19,763
Well, l mean, no.
Like l thought you were, but... And then...

418
00:30:20,098 --> 00:30:25,730
l don't know. Now, l think that maybe
you're just misunderstood.

419
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:29,273
Nobody's misunderstood.

420
00:30:30,075 --> 00:30:33,943
That's just what people say
when they don't like who they are.

421
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:39,815
lf you think l'm a bitch,
then l guess it's because l am.

422
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:43,046
But then l guess you're going to have
to come to terms

423
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:46,488
with the fact
that you're into a girl who's a bitch.

424
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,492
Well, how do you feel
about newspaper dorks?

425
00:30:50,562 --> 00:30:52,894
l'll let you know when l see one.

426
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:11,580
Great. You know, l better go get Marlon
before <i>K</i>irkpatrick castrates him.

427
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:15,913
Thanks for the dance, Funke.

428
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:42,906
Dude, l think that chick just winked at me.

429
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:46,183
She's not bad.

430
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:47,946
Yeah, for a pirate.

431
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,380
l'm going to go spit in the punch.

432
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:58,721
Hey, you light on your feet, Funke.
That's good.

433
00:31:58,797 --> 00:31:59,786
-Thanks.
-But we notice

434
00:31:59,864 --> 00:32:01,855
you having a problem out there.

435
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:04,561
-l do? What?
-lt's your hard-on.

436
00:32:04,636 --> 00:32:07,867
Yeah, that close to a girl like her,
it's natural.

437
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:10,668
l didn't realize it was so obvious.

438
00:32:10,742 --> 00:32:14,075
What you're gonna wanna do,
okay, is you tuck that thing

439
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:17,205
into the side of your boxer shorts,
so it runs down the leg.

440
00:32:17,282 --> 00:32:19,477
That way you can contain it.

441
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:22,418
lt's like getting a stiff rod
when you're taking a dump.

442
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:23,613
A shit boner.

443
00:32:23,688 --> 00:32:26,452
Yeah. Then you got to jam it into the bowl
like it owes you money.

444
00:32:26,524 --> 00:32:30,460
But you don't want to dunk it.
lt's not a clown. Down!

445
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:33,656
But you also don't want to
get the peepee on your shirt.

446
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:35,723
lt's a no-win situation.

447
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:43,571
At ease, gentlemen. Erections or otherwise.

448
00:32:44,109 --> 00:32:47,272
l remember similar conversations
with my men

449
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:51,409
when we were tracking the towel-heads
to their <i>tariqs</i>

450
00:32:52,517 --> 00:32:56,419
Pitch-black little spider holes
no wider than a hula hoop.

451
00:32:56,988 --> 00:32:59,980
Like the Charlotte, the web.

452
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:03,191
Do you understand what he's saying?

453
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:07,559
Fear, Mr. Delacruz.
That's what l'm talking about. Fear.

454
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:12,829
Fear is the middle name of war,
Mr. Delacruz.

455
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:14,799
l learned that in the Storm.

456
00:33:14,873 --> 00:33:16,568
What is the Storm, sir?

457
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:23,439
Two hundred and thirteen days in country.
Terrible heat.

458
00:33:24,115 --> 00:33:27,744
The sound of mortar fire day and night
ringing in your ears.

459
00:33:29,154 --> 00:33:31,486
The occasional dog exploding.

460
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:34,349
But l used to lead men.

461
00:33:34,426 --> 00:33:37,054
Men that reminded me of you, Mr. Funke.

462
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,359
On your feet, son.

463
00:33:44,302 --> 00:33:47,362
l want to thank you for your help
in getting those SATs back.

464
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:49,703
Yeah, don't worry about it.

465
00:33:50,608 --> 00:33:54,305
-l'm sorry for being such a jerk-off.
-lt's okay.

466
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:58,042
lf l ever catch you chewing that in class,
l'll kill you.

467
00:33:59,384 --> 00:34:02,182
-You read me?
-Like Cliff Notes, sir.

468
00:34:02,253 --> 00:34:05,552
Good. Go out there and have a good time.

469
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:23,138
How's it feel?

470
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:25,335
Like l just got punched in the mouth.

471
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:29,141
My life is over now, dick!
l didn't steal those SATs!

472
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:32,673
Then where were you
between 7:45 and 8:10 that night?

473
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:36,152
Who the hell do you think you are?
lnspector Gadget?

474
00:34:36,521 --> 00:34:39,979
You really think l'd chance
everything for a test score?

475
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:43,059
l'd already gotten into Cornell.

476
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:45,358
Well, then why did you take
the SATs again?

477
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:48,228
l just wanted to see if l could do better.

478
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,434
Man, you wouldn't know the truth
if it was staring you in the face.

479
00:35:01,112 --> 00:35:03,546
<i>Hello, Cornell Goodbye, motive</i>

480
00:35:04,282 --> 00:35:06,113
<i>I still thought Paul was an asshole,</i>

481
00:35:06,184 --> 00:35:09,881
<i>but maybe he wasn't the kind of asshole</i>
<i>who'd steal the SATs</i>

482
00:35:09,954 --> 00:35:14,015
<i>That sting wasn't my mouth</i>
<i>I was starting to doubt my story</i>

483
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:21,024
Well done, Bobby.
You got into the Northwestern program.

484
00:35:24,702 --> 00:35:26,067
Wait, one more thing.

485
00:35:26,137 --> 00:35:28,264
Some grad student by the name of
Striedel will be in contact

486
00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:29,567
to fact-check the article.

487
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:31,438
lt's just a formality.

488
00:35:31,509 --> 00:35:33,238
You're on your way.

489
00:35:38,082 --> 00:35:40,915
<i>Sure I was on my way To the gallows</i>

490
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:42,350
<i>If I didn't set the story straight</i>

492
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:46,518

00:36:23,895 --> 00:36:25,419
You got three.

501
00:36:34,672 --> 00:36:37,163
Aren't you supposed to be in homeroom?

502
00:36:37,942 --> 00:36:39,432
Maybe l got to thinking.

503
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:42,036
Maybe you should have done that sooner.

504
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,315
Where were you that night?

505
00:36:50,388 --> 00:36:51,946
You think it's that easy?

506
00:36:52,023 --> 00:36:55,390
You think l can just tell you where l was
and it's gonna set it all straight?

507
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,758
l mean, take a look around you, Funke!

508
00:36:57,829 --> 00:36:59,990
l'm screwed now no matter what l say.

509
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:02,328
So then just tell me the truth.

510
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:11,138
lf you didn't do it, l'm all you got.

511
00:37:12,043 --> 00:37:15,376
And you only got me
for one more minute, so spill it!

512
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:16,708
Come on.

513
00:37:21,352 --> 00:37:24,014
Last year l did some things
on the basketball court

514
00:37:24,088 --> 00:37:26,249
l'm not exactly proud of.

515
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:28,015
Like what?

516
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:31,261
Shaving points. Twice last season.

517
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:36,128
lt was two times too many.
l only did it because l needed the money.

518
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:39,169
What for?

519
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:41,131
lt doesn't matter.

520
00:37:41,205 --> 00:37:44,333
When l was approached this year,
l turned them down.

521
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:46,309
We had a shot at State.

522
00:37:46,377 --> 00:37:49,005
l wasn't going to mess that up
for my senior year.

523
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:53,574
So this person who approached you,
you think that he may have set you up?

524
00:37:54,452 --> 00:37:56,477
l don't know. Maybe.

525
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:07,796
Give me his name. What's his name, Moore?

526
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:11,702
Look, if you don't get cooperative,
l can't help you!

527
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:13,300
You've got to give me his name, now!

528
00:38:13,371 --> 00:38:15,168
You got to start thinking with your head!

529
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:17,298
You know the amount of power
that comes with the presidency!

530
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:19,309
Everybody wants a piece of me!

531
00:38:19,377 --> 00:38:20,867
All right, time's up, Funke.

532
00:38:20,945 --> 00:38:23,675
You're getting the animals all riled up.

533
00:38:25,183 --> 00:38:27,151
What's his name, Moore?

534
00:38:27,585 --> 00:38:29,348
Look, l said time's up.

535
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,684
-Give me his name.
-Come on. Come on.

536
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:33,621
-What's his name?
-Freddy Bismark.

537
00:38:33,691 --> 00:38:36,091
Where do l find him? Moore!

538
00:38:43,668 --> 00:38:47,035
<i>Bobby Funke,</i>

Hey, yeah.
Well, actually it's pronounced ''Funk''.

<i>Transcriptions of your interviews</i>

547
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:08,786

00:39:11,095 --> 00:39:12,892
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

550
00:39:12,964 --> 00:39:15,432
l'm just going to need some time
to get it together.

551
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,991
So can l get your number or something?

552
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:19,161
<i>No</i>

553
00:39:19,237 --> 00:39:21,034
Wait! What? Hello?

554
00:39:30,615 --> 00:39:32,412
<i>I had to find Freddy Bismark</i>

555
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:34,314
<i>And there was one place</i>
<i>I knew I could track down</i>

556
00:39:34,385 --> 00:39:36,683
<i>even the most elusive characters</i>

557
00:39:36,754 --> 00:39:38,585
lt's freaky, isn't it?

558
00:39:39,123 --> 00:39:42,388
And apparently, they just got results
back from the ACTs.

559
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,588
Some of our best and brightest bombed it.

560
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:47,324
Really?

561
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:49,992
You see Shamus Finnle over there?

562
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:54,970
-His teeth are chattering.
-lt's probably from the Prylert.

563
00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:57,835
Really? l didn't know
that Shamus had ADD.

564
00:39:57,909 --> 00:40:00,537
For a reporter, you're really out of the loop.

565
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:03,102
Half the school is taking Prylert right now,

566
00:40:03,181 --> 00:40:05,911
or Axitol or Ripenol, maybe Faldox.

567
00:40:05,983 --> 00:40:08,577
All just nice words for speed.

568
00:40:08,653 --> 00:40:11,121
lf a kid needs a study aid,
he'll find a way to get one.

569
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:12,781
Shamus Finnle.

570
00:40:12,857 --> 00:40:14,825
Supply and demand, son.

571
00:40:16,494 --> 00:40:17,859
<i>I found Freddy Bismark</i>

572
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:21,729
<i>where all high-school graduates</i>
<i>go on to live in infamy</i>

573
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,161
<i>They say a picture is worth 1,000 words,</i>

574
00:40:25,236 --> 00:40:28,330

575
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:30,306
<i>''Dolla dolla bills, y'all!''</i>

576
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:33,070
You're not supposed to be looking at that.

577
00:40:33,144 --> 00:40:36,705
lt's called study hall
because you're supposed to study.

578
00:40:36,781 --> 00:40:38,544
What are you, a cop?

579
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:28,761
l'm looking for the business.

580
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:41,474
And no, no, you cannot pay me back
on your meal card.

581
00:41:41,546 --> 00:41:44,014
l need cash. This is a business l'm running.

582
00:41:44,081 --> 00:41:47,073
l know it's your bar mitzvah money,
but l have to take it.

583
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:48,846
You lost the bet.

584
00:41:50,488 --> 00:41:51,580
Yes.

585
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:53,954
l will take... Yes, l'll a check!

586
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:56,823
But if it bounces, l'm coming after you.

587
00:41:56,894 --> 00:42:00,489
This is real stuff. You owe me 20 bucks!
Goodbye.

588
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:06,828
l'm sorry, we're closed for the semester.
No more pledges.

589
00:42:06,904 --> 00:42:08,496
l'm here about Paul Moore.

590
00:42:09,774 --> 00:42:11,207
Suck it!

591
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:13,004
Let me explain something to you.

592
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:15,637
l don't know thing one about Paul Moore.

593
00:42:15,713 --> 00:42:18,045
His name means nothing to me.

594
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:21,579
l have kids on over half the teams
on this district.

595
00:42:22,053 --> 00:42:25,489
And those pill poppers
are begging me to throw games.

596
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:28,016
And if l had to go out
and personally frame each one

597
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:29,684
that didn't want to brick a lay-up for me,

598
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,194
l wouldn't have time
to spend the money that l make.

599
00:42:32,263 --> 00:42:36,199
And as you can see,
l like spending the money that l make!

600
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:40,499
l mean, look around.
That painting is from the 16th Chapel.

601
00:42:40,938 --> 00:42:42,963
That's the first chapel ever.

602
00:42:43,507 --> 00:42:45,065
So what was the money for?

603
00:42:45,142 --> 00:42:47,110
Oh, my God!
l'm going to slap you in the face.

604
00:42:47,178 --> 00:42:49,339
l don't know. He was having girl problems!

605
00:42:49,413 --> 00:42:50,471
What's that supposed to mean?

606
00:42:50,548 --> 00:42:53,176
He was having problems with girls. All right?

607
00:42:53,251 --> 00:42:55,310
Come on, for a fellow Friar.

608
00:42:55,386 --> 00:42:58,719
No! Not for a fellow Friar.
For you to get the fuck out of here!

609
00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:01,519
Okay. lt was some chick from Mc<i>K</i>inley.
That's all l know.

610
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:03,822
Now, l'll see you, little man.

611
00:43:04,262 --> 00:43:05,889
Don't hurt yourselves.

612
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:15,537
<i>If Freddy Bismark didn't frame Paul,</i>
<i>then maybe the girl problem was behind it</i>

613
00:43:16,774 --> 00:43:18,765
There's the old wise guy.

614
00:43:18,843 --> 00:43:19,935
Elliot.

615
00:43:20,011 --> 00:43:21,205
Those pubes come in yet?

616
00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:23,179
You still eating your mom's dirty tampons?

617
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:24,236
<i>Only when I'm hungry</i>

618
00:43:24,515 --> 00:43:26,540
So as l was saying on the phone,

619
00:43:26,617 --> 00:43:29,450
l managed to implicate
our school president in a sordid theft

620
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,546
and in the process steal his girlfriend.

621
00:43:32,623 --> 00:43:35,023
-So what's the problem?
-Bitch.

622
00:43:35,793 --> 00:43:38,455
l'm not so sure the guy did it anymore.

623
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:41,089
Have you ever seen this guy around?

624
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:45,358
Yeah, that's Valerie's boyfriend.
You're dating Valerie?

625
00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:47,161
The plot thickens, Elliot.

626
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:49,936
l get it, peach fuzz.

627
00:43:50,007 --> 00:43:53,170
You think maybe l got tired
of being Paul's little plaything?

628
00:43:53,244 --> 00:43:56,270
Thought l'd teach him a lesson?
lt wasn't like that.

629
00:43:56,347 --> 00:43:57,712
What do you mean?

630
00:43:57,782 --> 00:44:01,843
Paul and l had something real, okay?
He could be himself around me.

631
00:44:02,353 --> 00:44:04,787
So what was the money for, then?

632
00:44:06,357 --> 00:44:07,984
That's got nothing to do with anything.

633
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:10,050
Look, Valerie,

634
00:44:11,295 --> 00:44:14,731
if Paul's innocent,
then you can help him by helping me.

635
00:44:21,572 --> 00:44:22,732
Okay.

636
00:44:23,741 --> 00:44:27,006
Ready for the after-school special
they call my life?

637
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:29,740
l owed money to some unpleasant people.

638
00:44:30,648 --> 00:44:33,481
They were ready to collect on me
as interest.

639
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:37,948
Paul wouldn't stand for it.
Someone tells him about Freddy Bismark.

640
00:44:38,356 --> 00:44:40,620
Paul has two off nights.

641
00:44:41,092 --> 00:44:42,525
My debt goes away.

642
00:44:42,626 --> 00:44:44,856
Paul threw two games for you.

643
00:44:46,831 --> 00:44:50,528
He would've thrown the entire season
if l'd asked him to.

644
00:44:52,703 --> 00:44:54,637
<i>Valerie was another dead end</i>

645
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:56,639
<i>If Paul was keeping her a secret,</i>

646
00:44:56,707 --> 00:44:59,540
<i>I wondered</i>
<i>what else he was holding back on</i>

647
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:23,590
<i>I know that some of you kids know</i>
<i>that I fought in Desert Storm</i>

648
00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:25,631
<i>And you know why? I fought for you kids,</i>

649
00:45:25,703 --> 00:45:27,933
<i>and I fought for this country</i>
<i>and this school!</i>

650
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:29,768
<i>For St Donovan's!</i>

651
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:31,708
<i>It's no joke!</i>

652
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:35,201
<i>Sometimes, I don't know,</i>
<i>I can get carried away,</i>

653
00:45:35,279 --> 00:45:38,271
<i>but I wrote this song last night</i>
<i>and I want you to sing it with me</i>

654
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:41,512
<i>If you want, you can sing it,</i>
<i>you can march, yeah!</i>

655
00:45:41,585 --> 00:45:43,678
<i>Come on, kids, sing it with me!</i>

656
00:45:50,061 --> 00:45:51,722
What's going on?

657
00:45:51,796 --> 00:45:53,991
<i>K</i>irkpatrick's on some school-spirit rampage.

658
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:57,465
He canceled a.m. classes
to have a pep rally.

659
00:45:58,903 --> 00:46:00,632
<i>Merci, K</i>irkpatrick.

660
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:12,006
<i>You can sing if you want</i>
<i>You can march if you want!</i>

661
00:46:31,402 --> 00:46:32,562

662
00:46:44,348 --> 00:46:46,407

<i>Let us create a better tomorrow</i>

00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:34,024
<i>I see Friars!</i>

669
00:47:45,342 --> 00:47:47,401
Marlon, can you hear me?

670
00:47:47,478 --> 00:47:49,742
lt's a paintball, you pussy!

671
00:47:56,754 --> 00:47:59,086
This way! This way, children!

672
00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:03,057
l'm hit! l'm hit!

673
00:48:13,537 --> 00:48:14,765
Moore!

674
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:41,490
l'm going to go to the vending machine
for some pretzels.

675
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:44,227
Do you want anything from downstairs?

676
00:48:44,301 --> 00:48:46,269
How about a bandage?

677
00:48:51,075 --> 00:48:52,474
Forget it.

678
00:49:07,891 --> 00:49:09,051
Nurse Platt's phone.

679
00:49:09,126 --> 00:49:11,060
<i>Just got word your boy shot some kids</i>

680
00:49:11,128 --> 00:49:13,926
<i>How does that sit with the facts</i>
<i>of your story, I'd like to ask, Funke?</i>

681
00:49:13,998 --> 00:49:16,865
Striedel, how the hell did you...

682
00:49:16,934 --> 00:49:18,162
<i>I have not Yes, yes</i>

683
00:49:18,235 --> 00:49:20,760
<i>I have not received your notes</i>
<i>on the story, boss</i>

684
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:24,706
Well, yeah, l know l've been
doing some backtracking to,

685
00:49:24,775 --> 00:49:26,140
you know, locate everything.

686
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:28,508
<i>Backtracking, huh?</i>
<i>There was a kid a few years back,</i>

687
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:30,046
<i>said he was doing some backtracking</i>

688
00:49:30,114 --> 00:49:32,674
<i>Turned out he fabricated the whole story</i>
<i>to get into the program</i>

689
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:35,412
<i>They kicked him out, of course</i>
<i>Blackballed him</i>

690
00:49:35,486 --> 00:49:37,545
<i>Last I heard he was working</i>
<i>as a pharmaceutical test subject</i>

691
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:39,248
<i>for carpal tunnel syndrome</i>

692
00:49:39,323 --> 00:49:40,585
<i>Your story's thin, kid</i>

693
00:49:40,658 --> 00:49:43,218
<i>Do you really think</i>
<i>you can pull one over on Ben Striedel?</i>

694
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:45,285
<i>I want your notes, stat</i>

695
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:53,731
Hey.

696
00:49:55,739 --> 00:49:58,867
There's something that l need to tell you.

697
00:49:58,942 --> 00:50:01,410
Not before l get to say thank you.

698
00:50:02,413 --> 00:50:03,744
For what?

699
00:50:03,814 --> 00:50:06,009
For saving my life out there.

700
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:10,242
lt was just a paintball gun.

701
00:50:10,321 --> 00:50:12,448
Yeah, but you didn't know that, did you?

702
00:50:12,523 --> 00:50:15,981
Look, Francesca, as an ethical journalist

703
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,427
and a man who's dedicated to the truth,

704
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:23,896
l think you should know
that your boyfriend was probably...

705
00:50:29,606 --> 00:50:31,631
He's not my boyfriend.

706
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:35,403
Now what did you want to tell me?

707
00:50:49,059 --> 00:50:51,721
That was nice shooting out there, Mr. Moore.

708
00:50:51,795 --> 00:50:55,424
Another three inches to the left
and you would have had a kill shot on me.

709
00:50:55,499 --> 00:50:59,697
You got this all wrong.
l didn't steal the SATs.

710
00:51:01,739 --> 00:51:03,138
Anything else?

711
00:51:03,207 --> 00:51:05,675
Yeah. This place sucks!

712
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:10,478
You'll be sucking soon enough, Mr. Moore.

713
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:21,146
<i>They locked Paul away at some</i>
<i>undisclosed private institution</i>

714
00:51:22,092 --> 00:51:25,687
<i>My story put him there</i>
<i>Now it was my job to get him out</i>

715
00:51:31,068 --> 00:51:32,403
l'll tell you whatever you want to know.

716
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,619
Meds, three times a day.

717
00:52:01,832 --> 00:52:02,958
PMW.

718
00:52:06,437 --> 00:52:07,995
Paul Moore way.

719
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:11,166
Paul, l need your help.

720
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:15,072
l know someone framed you
for stealing the SATs,

721
00:52:17,414 --> 00:52:21,043
but l just don't know who.
Who do you think framed you?

722
00:52:21,585 --> 00:52:23,985
Who set you up? Come on, Paul.

723
00:52:26,557 --> 00:52:28,616
Are you here to take me home?

724
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:35,458
<i>After three hours,</i>
<i>the only thing I got out of Paul</i>

725
00:52:35,566 --> 00:52:37,830
<i>was a sinking feeling in my stomach</i>

726
00:52:38,302 --> 00:52:43,103
All right, Mitch, we're looking for weapons,
obviously, anything that can kill a student.

727
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:46,870
<i>K</i>nives, guns. But it's not always obvious.

728
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:50,041
Are you kidding me?
You know the rule about gum!

729
00:52:50,113 --> 00:52:53,378
Raise your arms, please. With the women,
you want to use the backs of the hands.

730
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:55,816
The backs of the hands, Mitch.

731
00:52:55,953 --> 00:52:58,444
Last rule. Most important rule.

732
00:52:58,522 --> 00:52:59,921
You're gonna wanna fuck them.

733
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:02,891
Do not fuck the students,
do you understand?

734
00:53:04,962 --> 00:53:06,657
<i>The scene of the crime</i>

735
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:10,359
<i>Give a lunatic a paintball gun</i>
<i>and you'd expect a Jackson Pollock</i>

736
00:53:10,434 --> 00:53:12,425
<i>But Paul was more precise</i>

737
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:15,338
<i>Every shot counted But for what?</i>

738
00:53:15,405 --> 00:53:18,499
<i>Francesca? That's easy She broke his heart</i>

739
00:53:18,575 --> 00:53:20,566
<i>Me? I broke the story</i>

740
00:53:20,644 --> 00:53:22,669
<i>Kirkpatrick? Mercy killing</i>

741
00:53:22,746 --> 00:53:25,647
<i>But what about Alex Schneider,</i>
<i>the school treasurer?</i>

742
00:53:25,716 --> 00:53:27,513
<i>What about Marlon and the Mullens?</i>

743
00:53:27,584 --> 00:53:30,519
<i>They were his friends</i>
<i>and fellow members of the student council</i>

744
00:53:30,587 --> 00:53:34,717
<i>If Paul's painting meant something,</i>
<i>maybe those guys could explain it to me</i>

745
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:37,783
Yo, check it out,
it's that slut Laura Hoffner.

746
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:40,421
Dude, you don't even
want to know what l did to that ass!

747
00:53:40,497 --> 00:53:43,591
Probably the same thing
l did to your mom's ass.

748
00:53:44,568 --> 00:53:47,059
Dude, that's Mom. Our mom.

749
00:53:49,106 --> 00:53:50,198
Yeah.

750
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:54,443
Yo, yo, check it out. l got this move
that l like to call the operator, right?

751
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:56,638
lt's when l'm railing a girl,

752
00:53:56,713 --> 00:53:58,704
and then l reach down
and steal her cell phone

753
00:53:58,782 --> 00:54:01,979
and l call up her dad so he can listen
to me do her.

754
00:54:02,052 --> 00:54:05,488
-Yeah, Daddy. Yes...
-Father's very special.

755
00:54:08,258 --> 00:54:09,919
Are you lost, freshman?

756
00:54:11,628 --> 00:54:13,061
Why did he shoot you, Marlon?

757
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:14,222
He shot you, too, didn't he?

758
00:54:14,298 --> 00:54:15,424
Yeah. Well, he shot you first.

759
00:54:15,499 --> 00:54:19,162
Hey, you want detention
for the rest of your life, fuck face?

760
00:54:19,236 --> 00:54:22,296
Hey, Funke, why don't you...
Why don't you come to my house on Friday?

761
00:54:22,372 --> 00:54:23,498
l'm gonna have a little party.

762
00:54:23,574 --> 00:54:24,563
No, dude. Come on.

763
00:54:24,641 --> 00:54:27,940
lt's okay. l mean, he just wants
to ask me some questions, right?

764
00:54:28,011 --> 00:54:30,172
For the school paper.

765
00:54:30,247 --> 00:54:31,771
l mean, l don't want to get on his bad side.

766
00:54:31,848 --> 00:54:34,248
We all saw what happened to Moore.

767
00:55:11,989 --> 00:55:13,786
Funke, you made it.

768
00:55:17,027 --> 00:55:18,756
So this is a party.

769
00:55:18,829 --> 00:55:20,990
Yeah, well, you knew enough
to be fashionably late.

770
00:55:21,064 --> 00:55:23,760
Well, no, actually l had a flat tire, so...

771
00:55:24,034 --> 00:55:26,798
Twenty bucks says that toothpaste
doesn't do a goddamn thing.

772
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:28,701
l'll fucking smoke it myself.

773
00:55:28,772 --> 00:55:30,069
Smoke what you got, man.

774
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:31,564
You want a beer?

775
00:55:31,642 --> 00:55:35,578
Well, actually l have to get up early
for my driver's test. Okay.

776
00:55:38,582 --> 00:55:39,844
lt's good.

777
00:55:40,517 --> 00:55:42,985
lt's like a good brew, it's really...
lt's really cold.

778
00:55:43,053 --> 00:55:45,180
l'm so going to corrupt you.

779
00:55:58,235 --> 00:56:00,203
-Shit! No!
-Okay, man.

780
00:56:00,671 --> 00:56:02,832
Hey, Marlon, you and Paul Moore

781
00:56:02,906 --> 00:56:05,272
have been on the student council together
for two years.

782
00:56:05,342 --> 00:56:06,570
ln all that time did he ever seem...

783
00:56:06,643 --> 00:56:08,304
-Funke.
-Yeah?

784
00:56:08,745 --> 00:56:10,212
lt's a party.

785
00:56:12,182 --> 00:56:14,776
Yeah, Funke,
you can put this on the record, okay?

786
00:56:18,588 --> 00:56:20,078
Tastes minty.

787
00:56:22,959 --> 00:56:24,654
Tastes like a veal cutlet.

788
00:56:24,728 --> 00:56:28,630
No, it's like... lt's like a baby lamb chop
with the mint jelly.

789
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,825
Tastes like a joint, you fags!

790
00:56:32,502 --> 00:56:34,265
Beer pong. Just focus on the cup.

791
00:56:34,471 --> 00:56:36,939
Come on, Funke,
give me your best shot.

792
00:56:54,558 --> 00:56:55,923
Nice shot!

793
00:57:00,097 --> 00:57:01,359
Goal!

794
00:57:12,676 --> 00:57:14,166
Hold this.

795
00:58:09,299 --> 00:58:11,699
All right, let's play this game.

796
00:58:12,102 --> 00:58:13,797
l've got winners.

797
00:58:19,209 --> 00:58:20,972
-Yo, what do you want us to do with him?
-Take him upstairs.

798
00:58:21,044 --> 00:58:22,068
Tie him up.

799
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:25,444
l can take another one of those two bitches,
all right? Give me one.

800
00:58:26,616 --> 00:58:28,140
Where's the toothpaste?

801
00:58:31,521 --> 00:58:33,352
Hey, it's baby Funke.

802
00:58:33,623 --> 00:58:35,648
Take it. Take it like a man.

803
00:58:36,326 --> 00:58:40,353
The little prick told me he was going
to a seminar on surveillance technology.

804
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:44,457
l feel bad for him.
He's totally gaga for that cum-dumpster.

805
00:58:44,534 --> 00:58:50,029
A single pussy hair
can pull a battleship through the desert.

806
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:55,778
-Hey. What are you guys doing here?
-Think about it.

807
00:58:55,846 --> 00:58:58,576
The real question is,
what are you doing here?

808
00:58:58,648 --> 00:59:01,048
l'm just... l'm doing research
for the school paper.

809
00:59:01,117 --> 00:59:04,678
Yeah. You're writing a story
on Francesca's pink beav.

810
00:59:06,256 --> 00:59:07,655
No, seriously.

811
00:59:07,991 --> 00:59:11,688
Listen to me.
You need to sink the pink tonight, <i>hermano</i>

812
00:59:11,761 --> 00:59:15,162
l hope you...before, that way you can last.

813
00:59:15,232 --> 00:59:17,598
Yeah. You don't want to be a premie.

814
00:59:17,801 --> 00:59:18,893
A premie?

815
00:59:18,969 --> 00:59:20,334
Word gets around.

816
00:59:20,403 --> 00:59:23,804
lt's true. She's used to Paul Moore.
That guy can last.

817
00:59:24,407 --> 00:59:26,102
How do you know?

818
00:59:26,509 --> 00:59:29,103
-l just know.
-Hey, Funke, listen.

819
00:59:29,379 --> 00:59:35,181
After you come,
you're going to hate her, hate her.

820
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:38,749
l don't know why, but you will.

821
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:42,922
-Well, l got to get back.
-To do the story.

822
00:59:42,993 --> 00:59:44,585
-Right?
-Right.

823
00:59:44,661 --> 00:59:45,958
Dig deep, <i>hermano</i>

824
00:59:46,029 --> 00:59:47,656
Yeah, balls deep.

825
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:51,790
See you guys on Monday.

826
00:59:52,636 --> 00:59:55,628
<i>K</i>eep it going. Come on. Give me something.
Give me something.

827
00:59:55,705 --> 00:59:56,933
Yeah!

828
00:59:58,708 --> 00:59:59,970
Work with me!

829
01:00:00,043 --> 01:00:04,002
Hey, stranger. So l wanted to talk to you
about a follow-up to your story.

830
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:08,244
l was thinking like maybe an editorial piece
on the student council or something.

831
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:09,979
-Clara.
-Yeah?

832
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:11,910
lt's a party.

833
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,261
lsn't this Marlon's room?

834
01:00:26,336 --> 01:00:29,533
Yeah, well, somebody
already passed out in my bed.

835
01:00:30,307 --> 01:00:33,572
Well, then won't he mind that we're in here?

836
01:00:33,643 --> 01:00:35,235

842
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:07,899
l like the way you look at me.
Like it's for real, you know?

843
01:01:10,046 --> 01:01:12,606
Like you don't have to impress anyone.

844
01:01:15,752 --> 01:01:19,153
Like if tomorrow
St. Donovan's would just disappear

845
01:01:19,222 --> 01:01:21,850
you'd still look at me the way you do.

846

You get me, Funke.

847
01:01:30,033 --> 01:01:33,332

Yeah? Well, you know, l don't like it.

01:01:39,042 --> 01:01:41,374
l think you need to take it off.

When do your parents come home?

851
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:56,424
My dad's out of town until Tuesday.

852
01:01:56,493 --> 01:01:58,085
What about your mom?

853
01:01:58,928 --> 01:02:00,862
My mom's dead, Funke.

854
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:02,891

For me, it's all about the aesthetic.

-The aesthetic?
-Yeah.

874
01:04:20,703 --> 01:04:24,400
Well, l must say, Mr. Funke,

01:14:58,174 --> 01:15:00,608
and that l am some kind of clown.

1007
01:15:00,676 --> 01:15:02,610
l'm not an effing clown.

1008
01:15:03,012 --> 01:15:05,378
And l'm not here to bring joy

1009
01:15:05,447 --> 01:15:09,884
and love and light and laughter
into your effing heart!

1010
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,616
Now l'm going to ask you one more time.

1011
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:16,758
And this time l expect an answer.

1012
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,286
ls

1013
01:15:20,329 --> 01:15:21,557
that

1014
01:15:22,498 --> 01:15:23,726
gum

1015
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:28,899
in your mouth?

1016
01:15:30,906 --> 01:15:32,965
ls this gum in my mouth?

1017
01:15:35,144 --> 01:15:39,877
ls this gum in my mouth?
Yeah, it is, actually. lt's gum.

1018
01:15:39,949 --> 01:15:43,476
lt's gum. lt's gum! lt's gum! lt's gum!
lt's gum! lt's gum!

1019
01:15:43,552 --> 01:15:47,784
l chew it all the time, 24<i>l</i>7.
l've got a fucking jumbo pack

1020
01:15:47,857 --> 01:15:49,757
in my pocket right now!

1021
01:15:49,825 --> 01:15:54,694
My locker, filled to the brim with gum!
No books, just gum!

1022
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:56,390
Now l am trying to talk to you

1023
01:15:56,465 --> 01:15:58,262
about matters
of the utmost importance here,

1024
01:15:58,334 --> 01:16:00,859
and you're talking to me about gum?

1025
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:28,788
Bathroom breaks, you get one.
Right after lunch.

1026
01:16:28,864 --> 01:16:30,923
Bring your work in first thing in the morning,

1027
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,968
which means you can get it done
by the end of third period.

1028
01:16:33,035 --> 01:16:34,662
Which is nice because
it gives you the rest of the day

1029
01:16:34,737 --> 01:16:36,136
to pretty much do whatever.

1030
01:16:36,605 --> 01:16:39,631
You get 15 minutes in the yard,
twice a week.

1031
01:16:40,342 --> 01:16:43,368
Mind and body, Funke, mind and body.

1032
01:16:50,352 --> 01:16:52,877
What should l do about Francesca?

1033
01:16:52,955 --> 01:16:55,856
Get some good porn and pray that she calls.

1034
01:17:17,546 --> 01:17:19,571
-Hello?
<i>-Hello, dickhead</i>

1035
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:22,110
You have got to be kidding me.

1036
01:17:22,184 --> 01:17:23,242
<i>I've got two stories on my desk</i>

1037
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:25,549

<i>the living shit out of the other</i>

1038
01:17:25,621 --> 01:17:28,454
<i>Did you really think that you could</i>
<i>pull one over on old Ben Striedel?</i>

1039
01:17:28,524 --> 01:17:31,015
<i>Did you?</i>
<i>Because that's wholesale crazy, chief!</i>

1040
01:17:31,093 --> 01:17:34,392
<i>I have a 175 IQ</i>
<i>That means I skipped the third grade</i>

1041
01:17:34,463 --> 01:17:36,658
You don't understand, Striedel.
l was framed.

1042
01:17:36,732 --> 01:17:39,997
The school treasurer is moving
money around to sell drugs.

1043
01:17:40,069 --> 01:17:43,300
<i>That's rich Now you're going to</i>
<i>frame the treasurer?</i>

1044
01:17:43,372 --> 01:17:44,896
<i>Is the class secretary next?</i>

1045
01:17:44,974 --> 01:17:46,373
<i>What's the money got to do</i>
<i>with stolen SATs?</i>

1046
01:17:46,442 --> 01:17:48,933
Nothing.
They're two completely separate things.

1047
01:17:49,011 --> 01:17:50,376
<i>Let me give you a freebie, kid</i>

1048

1050

<i>Follow the money, dipshit</i>
<i>You got till Monday to give me the truth</i>

1051
01:18:12,468 --> 01:18:14,959
l'm gonna call a time out.

1052
01:18:15,704 --> 01:18:16,693
Time out?

1053
01:18:17,306 --> 01:18:18,830
That was good.

1054
01:18:21,777 --> 01:18:23,301
l-3.

1055
01:18:23,379 --> 01:18:24,846
lt's a hit! Fuck!

1056
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:26,881
l told you putting it in there was a bad idea.

1057
01:18:26,949 --> 01:18:29,941
Really, Stinky Landy?
l put it where you wanna put it.

1058
01:18:30,019 --> 01:18:32,249
That's nice. ls it new?

1059
01:18:32,321 --> 01:18:34,118
No, it's my mom's.

1060
01:18:34,423 --> 01:18:35,981
Well, connect the dots.

1061
01:18:36,058 --> 01:18:37,685
l told you not to line up the ships like that.

1062
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,921
lt's like Pearl Harbor.

1063
01:18:42,197 --> 01:18:45,189
Could you guys please
just use your library voices.

1064
01:18:45,267 --> 01:18:47,258
Sorry, l'm just trying to think.

1065
01:18:47,336 --> 01:18:49,361
You can't let Goltz get
one up on you, Funke.

1066
01:18:49,438 --> 01:18:51,872
That guy is an enormous vagina.

1067
01:19:04,353 --> 01:19:06,048
<i>Connect the dots</i>

1068
01:19:06,488 --> 01:19:08,615
<i>Connect them, come here</i>

1069
01:19:14,897 --> 01:19:16,626
What are you looking at, Funke?

1070
01:19:17,266 --> 01:19:18,290
Funke, where you go?

1071
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:22,565
These four walls.
You just stay, bounce... Like a pinball.

1072
01:19:22,638 --> 01:19:24,697
That's it. You can't run.

1073
01:19:31,713 --> 01:19:33,305
Hey, hall monitor!

1074
01:20:11,553 --> 01:20:12,850
Francesca?

1075
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:22,961
Francesca?

1076
01:20:26,168 --> 01:20:27,601
Francesca?

1077
01:20:56,265 --> 01:20:58,529
<i>Mathematically, it's a percentage of your life</i>

<i>High school might be</i>
<i>the least wholesome four years of your life</i>

1083

<i>And there's nothing simple about it</i>

1084
01:21:19,221 --> 01:21:22,088
<i>High school is ugly, hard and complicated</i>

1085
01:21:22,157 --> 01:21:25,923
<i>As complicated as a conspiracy</i>
<i>to assassinate the president</i>

1086
01:21:26,328 --> 01:21:28,888
<i>A conspiracy about to be uncovered</i>

1087

<i>since their sophomore year</i>

1089
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:08,730
<i>The Mullens' dad was an orthopedist</i>
<i>with a habit of boning his patients</i>

1090
01:22:08,804 --> 01:22:11,932
<i>When he split with one of them,</i>
<i>the hip doctor left his family his van</i>

1091
01:22:12,007 --> 01:22:14,271
<i>and a box of prescription pads</i>

1092
01:22:14,343 --> 01:22:17,107
<i>The brothers made due</i>
<i>with their inheritance</i>

1093

Yo, shit biscuit!

1095
01:22:23,752 --> 01:22:26,846

<i>Initially, the market for</i>

<i>wasn't as ripe as they'd hoped</i>

1098
01:22:33,095 --> 01:22:36,326
<i>So like good businessmen,</i>
<i>they created a demand</i>

1099
01:22:37,699 --> 01:22:39,690
<i>They sabotaged tests throughout the school,</i>

<i>If you erase enough bubbles,</i>
<i>you can erase a kid's future</i>

1102
01:22:47,943 --> 01:22:49,774
Supply and demand, son.

1103
01:22:49,845 --> 01:22:51,210
<i>Business boomed</i>

1104
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:55,143

<i>P Moore wasn't exactly Alan Greenspan,</i>

1107
01:23:01,323 --> 01:23:03,655
<i>but it didn't take</i>

1108
01:23:03,725 --> 01:23:07,684
<i>that hundreds of dollars</i>
<i>were being shifted around weekly</i>

1109

<i>Marlon couldn't have that</i>

<i>Things were too good He had big plans</i>
<i>and the president was in the way</i>

1113
01:23:22,944 --> 01:23:25,310

1114
01:23:45,434 --> 01:23:46,765
What's going on, guys?

1115
01:23:46,835 --> 01:23:48,132
Funke...

1116
01:23:49,371 --> 01:23:52,465
You just don't know when to quit, do you?

1117
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:55,135
Guess not. Gum?

1118
01:23:59,181 --> 01:24:02,912
Changing the answers on the SATs
so you can sell more drugs.

1119
01:24:02,984 --> 01:24:07,318
lt's clever, Marlon.
Twisted, but clever nonetheless.

1120
01:24:08,223 --> 01:24:10,783
Should make for a great story.

1121
01:24:10,859 --> 01:24:14,351
Bad move, Funke.
Open that window and bring him over.

1122
01:24:22,104 --> 01:24:23,765
Okay, here's the real story.

1123
01:24:23,839 --> 01:24:25,739
Bobby Funke made a few bad decisions,

1124
01:24:25,807 --> 01:24:28,298
lost his girlfriend,
and up and jumped out the window.

1125
01:24:28,377 --> 01:24:29,776
Just another tormented freshman.

1126
01:24:29,845 --> 01:24:31,745

1127
01:24:33,782 --> 01:24:35,545
Throw his ass out.

01:24:36,318 --> 01:24:38,912
-You won't do it.
-l won't?

1129

These sorts of things happen all the time.

1130
01:24:40,589 --> 01:24:43,615
There's a lot of pressure
here at St. Donovan's!

1131
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:45,524
Throw him out!

1132
01:24:47,362 --> 01:24:49,626
Fine, l'll do it myself.

1133
01:24:49,698 --> 01:24:51,632
Hey! Let him go!

1134
01:24:54,236 --> 01:24:56,431
Put him down! Delicately.

1135
01:24:56,505 --> 01:24:58,029
How the hell did they know you were here?

1136
01:24:58,106 --> 01:25:00,472
l might have made an announcement.

1137
01:25:16,691 --> 01:25:17,953
Funke.

You'll never understand why l did it.

1153
01:26:35,036 --> 01:26:37,470
Nobody's misunderstood, Francesca.

1154
01:26:38,206 --> 01:26:41,903
lt's just what people say
when they don't like who they are.

1155

Bobby, wait.

1156
