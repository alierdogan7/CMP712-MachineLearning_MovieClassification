like that?

Hi, Darlene.

What you got, staff sergeant?
In no time you made sergeant.

Hey, I don't mind going it alone.

You know, if you went alone once
in a while you might get somewhere.

168
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:14,055
We're cops, all right?
This isn't somewhere.

You know what you usually say
at these moments.

- What? What?
- Come on, man.

320

Oh, come on, you fucking moron.
Come on.

from the Mass Processor Company
out on Route 128.

These are the kind

from a couple hundred Miles away.

These pieces of plastic are worth
about 100 grand apiece.

for the company two months...

on Wednesday...

the processors to China.

408

you have anyone in with Costello now?

Allegedly.

But not the robbery.
That's not wrong.

for supper.

803
00:49:41,987 --> 00:49:43,905
<i>Sorry, yeah, I got held up.</i>

804
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:48,367
Yeah, no, you carry on without me.

805
00:49:49,411 --> 00:49:52,663
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

806
00:49:52,831 --> 00:49:54,582
Bye.

Everybody out. Move.

808
00:50:15,103 --> 00:50:16,354
Thank you.

809
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:19,065
So who are you?

810
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:22,693
I think you need a different attorney,
Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.

811
00:50:22,861 --> 00:50:24,529
So when the fuck am I gonna get out?

812
00:50:24,696 --> 00:50:28,032
All right, run the last number he called.
That's his house.

813
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,910
I'll swear to the judge
I surveilled him there...

814
00:50:31,078 --> 00:50:33,162
and abra-fucking-cadabra,
we got a warrant.

815
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:36,707
- Why did you use my phone?
- Because you didn't go in there.

The light's nice here in the morning.

818
00:50:54,643 --> 00:50:57,270
So do you wanna talk
about last night?

819
00:51:03,944 --> 00:51:07,446
You know, it's all right. Guys tend to
make too big a deal out of it.

820
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:14,954
It's actually quite common.

821
00:51:15,122 --> 00:51:16,747
I gotta go to work.

822
00:51:25,966 --> 00:51:27,800
Do you lie?

823
00:51:29,177 --> 00:51:31,679
Why? Do you?

824
00:51:31,847 --> 00:51:33,556
No, I'm asking if you lie.

825
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:37,018
Honesty
is not synonymous with truth.

826
00:51:37,185 --> 00:51:39,312
Yeah, you lie.

827
00:51:39,479 --> 00:51:40,646
You lie.

828
00:51:40,939 --> 00:51:43,482
Is it to do some good,
to get somewhere personally...

829
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:45,693
or, what, just for the fuck of it?

830
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:51,324
Well, I expect that some people do it
to keep things on an even keel.

831
00:51:52,492 --> 00:51:53,576
Wow.

832
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:56,746
So you had a parent
who was a drunk.

833
00:52:00,626 --> 00:52:02,335
Did you?

834
00:52:02,502 --> 00:52:04,170
No.

835
00:52:06,465 --> 00:52:08,215
Let's keep it with you.

836
00:52:08,383 --> 00:52:11,010

A mass murderer.

846
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:02,520
Your heart rate is jacked.

847
00:53:03,563 --> 00:53:05,314
And your hand...

848
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:08,401
steady.

849
00:53:10,779 --> 00:53:15,074
That's one thing I figured out
about myself in prison. My hand...

850
00:53:15,242 --> 00:53:17,451
does not shake.

851
00:53:18,245 --> 00:53:19,745
Ever.

852
00:53:28,588 --> 00:53:30,756
Wake the fuck up.

853
00:53:33,218 --> 00:53:35,219
There was a cop leaving
when I came in.

854
00:53:35,595 --> 00:53:37,596
How did you know he was a cop?

855
00:53:37,764 --> 00:53:42,560
Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight,
you know, air of scumbag entitlement.

856
00:53:42,728 --> 00:53:44,895
- Do you see cops?
- That's part of what I do.

857
00:53:45,063 --> 00:53:48,274
I normally don't see cadets
who've been kicked out of the academy.

858
00:53:48,442 --> 00:53:51,652
Oh, boy.
You should get a better job, huh?

859
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:54,196
Should I?

860
00:53:54,489 --> 00:53:57,825
So do they all come in here...

861
00:53:57,993 --> 00:54:00,244
and cry, your cops?

862
00:54:00,746 --> 00:54:03,706
Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes they cry, yeah.

863
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:07,084
If they've had trouble at home,
if they've had to use their weapons...

864
00:54:07,252 --> 00:54:09,378
Use their weapons?

865
00:54:09,921 --> 00:54:11,380
Let me tell you something.

866
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,841
They signed up to use their weapons.

867
00:54:14,009 --> 00:54:16,469
Most of them, all right.
But they watch enough TV...

868
00:54:16,636 --> 00:54:19,555
so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons.

869
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:22,767
There is no one more full of shit
than a cop.

870
00:54:22,934 --> 00:54:24,727

- Well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay?
- Exactly.

You signed the papers, remember?

00:55:17,155 --> 00:55:20,699
We're the only two people on this earth

the Special Investigation Unit.

- I thought I was supposed to tell...

00:57:56,147 --> 00:57:58,732
- the truth here, if only fucking here.
- You are! Yes.

1756
01:57:33,054 --> 01:57:36,056
<i>is that of Timothy Delahunt,
an undercover policeman for...</i>

1757
01:57:36,224 --> 01:57:38,725

This was the scene yesterday...</i>

1758
01:57:38,893 --> 01:57:41,854

in the marshes near the Fenway.</i>

Queenan died. I'm running him.
