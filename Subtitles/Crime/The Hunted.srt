violence.

00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,280
'God said to Abraham,
"Kill me a son."

'Abe says,
"Man, you must be putting me on."

'God say, "No." Abe say, "What?"

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,920
'God say,
"You can do what you want, Abe,

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,320
"but the next time you see me comin',
you better run."

this killing done?"

12
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,400
The Serbs have taken over
this Albanian village.

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,960
They're killing everyone in sight.
It's not a war. It's a slaughter.

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,800
The Serb commander
is in that mosque.

15
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,200
This is three villages in a week
he's destroyed.

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,360
We are to identify
and neutralise him. We will proceed

17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,360
under cover of NATO airstrike,
commencing...

18
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,400

Copy that. Raven is in the nest.

24
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,280
Cover fire, on my mark.

25
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,760

It is my privilege

to present to you the Silver Star,
one of our top awards for valour.

31
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,160
Your bravery, judgement and resolve
are an example to all soldiers.

32
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,440
Your courageous actions

33
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,520
are the bedrock upon which peace
and democracy are built.

34
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,160

Hey.

00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,600
What happened to you?
WOLF SNARLS

42
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,520
You stepped on a snare, didn't you?

44
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,840
Easy. Take it easy.

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,560
Be still.

46
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,720
Be still.

47
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,920
All right. Let me have that.

48
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,960
Nasty thing.

49
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,320
Next time you see one of these,
you go the other way.

50
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,080
OK...

51
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,120
There we go.

52
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,280
You're good, you're good.

53
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,920
OK.

54
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,520

CONVERSATION, LAUGHTER

56
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,960
Anyone here with the initials JW?
Yeah.

57
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,480
This yours?
Yeah, it is.

58
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,760
What the...?!

59
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,280
No more snares on wolves, guys.

60
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,960
I got him.

61
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,920
He was down there. What?

62
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,960
I saw him.

63
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,400
You need all that equipment
to kill a deer?
COCKS GUN

64
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,880
That's how we make sure
they're dead.

65
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,280
You guys don't look like
deer hunters.

66
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,520
When you kill with your own hands,

67
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,520
there is a reverence.

68
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,440
Is that right?

69
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,880
There is no reverence
in what you do.

70
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,480
Where's your weapon?

71
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,080
BLADE SINGS

72
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,960
Holy smoke.

73
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,320
You're not here for the deer,
are you? What's that?

74
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,880
You think you can hunt me
with those rifles?

75
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,520
Your rifles against my knife.

76
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,560
What are you, nuts?
What do you think?

77
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,320

You want antifreeze with that?

93
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,440
It's not that cold out.
Maybe not to you.

94
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,640
Thought you were on the wagon.
Wheels fell off.

95
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,160
You running a fever? It's the cold.
Not crazy about the thaw, neither.

96
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,000
Get a hot-water bottle.
Keep you company at night.

97
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,160
Forget it. I wanna go to California.
Do a little fishin'.

98
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,360
I hear the yellowtail jump into
the boat this time of year.

99
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,680
Zander, yellowtail aren't running
at this time of year. ..Hello, Ted.

100
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:12,200
LT. How d'you know it was me?
I saw your pigeon-toed tracks.

101
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,680
What're you doing this far north?

102
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,440
Van Zandt wanted me
to show you something. Personally.

103
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,040
Been a few years.
OKeechobee, 1996.

104
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:33,800
Your agents got scared of alligators.
One shat in his pants. Mike Hannay.

105
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,280
You disappeared after that.
Did a few more then quit.

106
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,680
Been at Portland three years now.
We reached out for you a few times.

107
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,480
LT, let me ask you something.
What the hell you doing out here?

108
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,880
Working for the Wildlife Fund.

109
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,520
Took a lot of trouble to get here.
You're a hard man to find.

110
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,000
No, I'm not. How hard am I to find
if you found me?

111
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,520
Van Zandt thinks it's important.

112
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,760
He thinks everything is.
This is different.

113
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,920
I don't do that kind of work anymore.
Why don't you have a look?

114
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,040
I don't want to go back there.

115
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,880
All we're asking you to do
is take a look, LT.

116
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,160
Tom, can we get
prints off that paper? Sure.

117
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,600
Do. And the door handles.
I'm worried about the SWAT agents.

118
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,640
I want these guys alive.

119
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,160
Reid, deploy some of your men
across the canyon.

120
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,600
Contain this area and establish
a perimeter. It's your call.

121
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,120
HE RETCHES

122
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,560
You gonna be all right? No. I hate
those things. I'm afraid of heights.

123
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,760
I'm Abby Durrell, the ASAC here. I'm
not sure how much Harry told you...

124
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,560
Tell me what he told you to tell me.
We'll take it from there.

125
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,160
HE RETCHES

126
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,760
They were found half a mile away.
They were killed with a hatchet

127
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,320
then gutted, it seems in ritualistic
fashion. Every organ was cut.

128
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,560
My deputy's talking to
the local Peyote chief.

129
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,800
There's no Peyote ritual
for gutting humans.

130
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,720
The bodies were quartered like you'd
quarter deer. Peyote are upset...

131
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,760
A Peyote wouldn't quarter
two deer hunters unless...

132
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,560
What? He's gonna eat them.

133
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,800
There were two men killed the same
way last week in Washington State.

134
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,520
They were Forest Rangers,
so we got jurisdiction.

135
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,480
Where are the bodies?
We sent 'em to the lab yesterday.

136
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,640
You need to see 'em? No.

137
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,800
You got too many men and horses here.
All these tracks. It's chaos.

138
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,760
You find a deer stand or coolers
for packing meat?

139
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,160
Not within a five-mile radius.

140
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,680
Still looking.

141
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,560
What do you know about the victims?

142
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,280
As far as we know,
two businessmen from Metford.

143
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,720
FLIES BUZZ

144
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,560
What else can we do for you?
Nothing. Ask everybody to fall back.

145
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,200
Bobby, get everyone out of there.

146
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,440
Guys, everybody, fall back.

147
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,520
Come on. Let's go!

148
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,960
Move back! Yeah, everyone!

HE SIGHS

151
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,360
This is him. Who?

152
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,320
The guy who did it. We don't know
how many killers there were.

153
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,360
Just one. How do you know?

154
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,880
Left his signature in that tree.
These were able-bodied men.

155
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,440
They had rifles with sophisticated
'scopes. One had a 9mm handgun.

156
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,960
You think one man with a hatchet...?

157
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,160
Not a hatchet. A knife.
With a serrated edge on one side.

158
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,880
And he threw it it at this tree,
then killed two men?

159
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,280
Yeah. Size ten shoes, no tread,
almost a slipper. Kind of like this.

160
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,360
He's out there.

161
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,320
You can't go alone.
That's how I work.

162
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,560
Take this. I don't need that.

163
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,520
Humour me. It's fully charged.
Make sure you leave it on. OK.

164
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,680
Need a gun? I don't like guns.

165
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,240
How much time do you need? If I'm
not back in two days, I'm dead.

168
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,880
Remember me? No.

169
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,800
You taught me.
I taught a lot of people.

170
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,200
How come
you didn't answer my letters?

171
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,400
How come you're chopping up
all these people?

172
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,600
You see the scopes they used?
They weren't hunters, LT.

173
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,160
They were sweepers.
You have to come in, son.

00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,880
LT GRUNTS

176
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,720
HE GRUNTS

177
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,320
HE GROANS

178
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,920
CRUNCH, MOANS

179
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,680
Move up.

180
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,840
Down! He's down!
Stay back, don't touch him.

181
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,120
Find the weapon.
BEEPING

182
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,280
Haul it in!

183
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,640
Bring him in.

184
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,560
LT. Sir.

185
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,920
Helluva job.
He's one of yours, isn't he? Yeah.

186
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,520
That's what I thought.
He's our man? Yeah.

187
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,400
Any idea why?
No. That'd be your job.

188
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,560
Would you like some coffee?
No, thank you, ma'am.

189
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:29,720
You don't have to talk to us
if you don't want to. I understand.

190
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,760
How about telling us your name?
We could start with that.

191
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,160
He knows my name.

192
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,160
Want to tell me
what happened in the woods?

193
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,080
You known six billion chickens will
die in slaughterhouses this year?

194
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,600
Does that connect to Silver Falls?

195
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,520
What if we had a species above us in
the food chain? How would you feel

196
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,160
if that species lost respect for us

197
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,280
and started slaughtering us
wholesale?

198
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,120
I don't know.

199
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,120
But it's very interesting.

200
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,720
Do you understand it?

201
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,360
Oh, yeah. Good.

202
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:15,920
What else did you want to tell
Mr Bonham you don't want to tell me?

203
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,400
I'd like to talk about
Operation Eagle, Cobra.

204
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:25,120
Shuddup! You'll get yourself killed.
He's Aaron Hallam. You remember me?

205
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,400
They're recording this shit.
So put it on record.

206
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,080
It'll never say what you want it to.
Then what am I doing here, people?

207
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,680
Moret, help me out here.
Is this our guy or not?

208
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,760
I know there are variables, Moret,

209
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,360
there always are,
but we can't indict a variable.

210
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,520
Hey, boss.

211
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:53,120
Sir, we understand you have a man
named Aaron Hallam in your custody.

212
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,240
How much do you know about him?

213
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:04,000
Born in 1968, raised in West
Virginia. High school equivalency,

214
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,880
although he scored
off the charts in science.

215
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,640
Joined the army at 18.

216
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,160
That's the strange part.

217
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:18,160
What's that, sir? Well, it doesn't
really tell us any more about him.

218
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:23,000
The record's incomplete.
Not even a date of discharge.

219
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,160
Sgt Hallam is unofficially
missing in action. Sir.

220
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,320
Unofficially.

221
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,520
That's a cover. That means
he's still doing work for you.

222
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,600
We're here to take possession
of your prisoner, sir.

223
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,280
This is not a military base.
Your man very likely

224
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,240
killed and mutilated four hunters
on Federal land.

225
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,400
I think you should take a look
at this, sir.

226
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,160
Unless we've been invaded
by a foreign power

227
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,840
and are officially at war,
you don't have any authority here.

228
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,720
I know you want to go
but we need the results.

229
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,960
And your statement.
You ever use that thing?

230
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,360
You mean have I shot anyone?
Yeah.

231
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,480
Would you ask a guy
the same question? Yeah.

232
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,120
Well, as a matter of fact I have.

233
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,520
Do we have to go into it? No.

234
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,440
OK.

235
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:49,520
Not a great view of the city.
It's a wilderness.

236
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,320
What's your relationship to Hallam?
I trained him.

237
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,760
To do what?
Trained him to survive.

238
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,320
I trained him to kill.

239
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:08,120
I trained a lot of people like him,
best of the best, shit like that.

240
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,080
I pulled your file.
You were never in the military.

241
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,880
No.

242
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,760
You just worked for them? Yeah.

243
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,920
Like a contractor.

244
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,160
You don't like to talk about it,
do you?

245
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,920
No.

246
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,720
HE SIGHS

247
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,080
My father was an army colonel.

248
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,760
When my brother was killed
in Vietnam, he decided

249
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,360
not to lose another son to that war.
End of story.

250
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,720
Dad was a tracker
before he joined the army

251
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,240
and I learned what I do from him.

252
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,400
What about Hallam? He's unusual.
He can kill anybody, without regret.

253
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,760
Most of those he killed never knew
he was in the same room as 'em.

254
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,960
How's that make you feel? Can't say.
I never killed anybody myself. I...

255
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,760
HE SIGHS

256
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,960
I just taught people how.

257
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,760
In many ways,
Hallam is a fine warrior.

258
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,280
After a tour in Kosovo he was given

259
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,600
another sensitive assignment,
off the books.

260
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,280
He went too far.

261
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,120
Innocent people lost their lives.

262
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,560
Hallam's battle stress
has become so deep

263
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,720
it's part of his personality.

264
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,160
And it's impossible to reverse.
He's a killing machine.

265
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,800
There is no way he can be indicted,

266
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,800
or tried in open court,
or any court.

267
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,000
He cannot be processed,
interviewed, charged with a crime

268
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,320
or copped out as a psycho.
He cannot appear in any newspaper.

269
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,320
As far as the world is concerned,
sir,

270
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,920
Aaron Hallam doesn't exist.

271
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,120
He's one of them.

272
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,160
They'll handle it.

273
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,440
You know why you're here, Aaron.

274
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,280
You wandered off the range.

275
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,560
It was way too messy, man.
We're supposed to be precise.

276
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,760
They weren't his family.

277
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,560
They were soldiers, Dale. There was
no backup, no way I could get out.

278
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,800
I was set up. That's bullshit.

279
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,840
You fucked up. You caused injury
and death to unarmed civilians.

280
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,720
They had weapons.

281
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,320
Well, that's the problem.

282
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,160
You can't tell the sharks
from the guppies any more.

283
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,200
That's what they're using now?

284
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,280
They say it's painless.
Course, they never use it on...

285
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,400
Release him, Aaron! Release him now!

286
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,560
You flying to Vancouver? Yeah.

287
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,560
Then a connecting flight?
No. A drive. Eight hours.

288
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,160
Right. You don't like flying.
Must be worth it.

289
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:29,120
It's a special place.
Come up sometime. You'd like it.

290
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,680
You don't have to wear two guns.
The whole posture would change.

291
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,920
It's an open invitation.

292
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,520
HE MOANS

293
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,720
GASPS, SHRIEKS

294
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,920
HE WHIMPERS

295
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,760
Is it painless, Dale?

296
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,960
We need paramedics here!

297
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,480
Help!
See if you can help people.

298
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,280
No, I can't!

299
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,120
Does anyone know what's going on...?

300
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,320
Ma'am, just sit down.

301
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,640
Paramedic! Paramedic!

302
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,320
I'm OK, I'm OK!
My buddies are in there.

303
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,480
Get 'em out, get 'em out!

304
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,520
I'm OK, I'm OK...

305
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,920
OK?

306
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,920
Horrible, yeah...

307
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,600
Get 'em out!
Hello?! Oh, shit...

308
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,880
Hello? You're breaking up!

309
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,360
Don't leave the house yet...

310
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,680
PA ANNOUNCEMENTS

311
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:35,120
"Do not leave your bags unattended.
Unattended bags will be destroyed."

312
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,920
You go over there,
I'll go down there. All right!

313
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,320
One, two, three, four, five,

314
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,520
six, seven, eight,

315
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,560
nine, ten.

316
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,080
Ready or not, here I come.

317
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,080
Hey.

318
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,200
MOUTHS SILENTLY

319
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,080
SHE CHUCKLES

320
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,360
LAUGHTER

321
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,480
'Now a breaking story
from reporter Jeff Gionola,

322
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,320
'who is live outside the tunnel
to Forest Park. Jeff?'

323
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:44,120
'Ken, we have just arrived
on the scene of a terrible accident

324
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:50,200
'just outside Forest Park. A truck
or van transporting people. We...'

325
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,680
SHOUTED INSTRUCTIONS

326
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:06,200
I will teach you...how to kill.
Quickly. Accurately. Efficiently.

327
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,600
It will become a reflex action.

328
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,840
You will learn to enter a combat zone
and evaporate into shadow.

329
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,680
You will learn how to survive.
Or you will not.

330
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,960
Ready!

331
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,480
Arm. Heart! Leg, leg!

332
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:29,680
Reverse your grip. Bring your knife
from the inside of his arm,

333
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:29,720
sever the tissue.
Pull his finger off the trigger,

334
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:33,520
come over his left shoulder,
grab the strap, choke.

335
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,720
Cut into his heart
and bring him down. Go.

336
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,600
Arm, throat, heart, leg, leg,
arm, lung. Good. Good.

337
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,080
'Enter the thigh here,
slicing the femoral artery,'

338
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,520
into this thigh and that artery.
This arm is in your way.

339
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:57,760
It cannot hurt you. The only thing
it can do is block the lung puncture.

340
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,160
Push it in front of his face
and go into his lung.

341
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,880
Now. Arm, neck, heart,
leg, leg, lung!

342
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,040
One, two, three, four, five, six.

343
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,640
One. Two. Three.

344
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,880
Power assist, four. Five. Six.

345
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,680
One, two, three, four, five, six.
One, two, three, four, five, six.

346
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,920
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Make this a good power assist.

347
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,800
You're looking for his backbone.

348
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,560
There we go.

349
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,480
Go.

350
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,680
There we go. Once again.

351
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,320
'LT.

352
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,000
'I don't think
I can do this any more.

353
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,520
'The nightmares are getting worse.

354
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,480
'I think I'm losing it, LT.

355
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,400
'I need to talk to you.

356
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,280
'I don't know if you've been
getting my letters, LT.

357
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,640
'I need to hear from you
or talk to you.

358
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,240

359
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,280
'Please write.'

360
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,520
Once you are able to kill mentally,

361
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,040
the physical part will be easy.

362
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,040
The difficult part...

363
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,800
..is learning how to turn it off.

364
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,920
All we know for sure is
that we have three fatalities.

365
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,560
We don't know if there were other
passengers. Access is very limited.

366
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,520
We have no new information
from the police or the FBI.

367
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,320
However, the van seems to be
a military vehicle,

368
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:57,920
possibly for carrying prisoners.
We'll try to confirm that.

369
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,880
Information is sketchy.
Rescue crews are still here,

370
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,520
with FBI agents and technicians.

371
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:08,240
We're getting no comment
from the FBI agents...

372
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,520
What happened? He's loose.

373
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,880
Hello, Irene. Ohhh, Aaron.

374
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,160
You scared me.
It's good to see ya.

375
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,880
I'm not listening to you.
Everything you said was a lie.

376
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:42,320
I've never lied to you. Where've
you been the last six months?

377
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,560
Working for the government.
That's a lie.

378
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:51,320
A damn lie. Get out of here. I don't
want to see you again. Aaron?

379
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,440
Aaron, you're back!

380
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,720
Hey, Loretta. Hup...!

381
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,600
It's so good to see you. I miss you
so much. Where have you been?

382
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,960
Loretta, go do your homework.
Can I visit with Aaron some more?

383
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,920
Later.
Will you stay for dinner, Aaron?

384
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,480
Go do your homework.

385
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:23,000
You can't just step back into
our lives, Aaron. I understand.

386
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,240
I don't even know
what you do for a living.

387
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,400
Did you look in my locker?

388
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,400
How could I do that?
You have four locks on the thing.

389
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,480
What track is that?

390
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,880
A squirrel.
That's right. Where's the next one?

391
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,760
Erm...
Bring it down. Where's the next?

392
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,040
I can't tell.

393
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,280
Hold it flat.

394
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,400
See? Every nine inches.

395
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,120
That's the gallop pattern.
Every nine inches.

396
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,160
Oh, yeah. I see.

397
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,680
What's this one?
That's a raccoon.

398
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:16,280
How come you never see him?
Well, they hide.

399
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:20,080
To survive.
Men don't respect animals any more.

400
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,880
They run 'em down or kill 'em

401
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,720
any chance they get.
I think that's sad.

402
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,880
RUSTLING, SHE GASPS

403
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,280

404
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,280
No, don't bother him now. Why?

405
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,320
He's hunting, too.

406
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,520
(Does he know we're here?)

407
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,440
Oh, he knows.

408
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,480
How?

409
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,240
He can sense it.

410
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,840
She's so happy to see you.

411
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,200
Sit down.

412

What's this?

413
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,480
You've gotta leave.
You gotta get out of Portland.

414
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,080
What do you mean?
You're in danger, Irene. Why?

415
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,160
You and Loretta. They'll come
and burn this house down.

416
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,680

Everything's fine.

Loretta, is it?

425
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,520
That's right.
We'd like to talk to you.

426
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:21,280
About what? Just routine, but
it'd be easier to talk inside.

427
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:27,560
If you make us come back
with a warrant, it won't be routine.

428
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,280
Going somewhere, Mrs Kravitz?

429
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:35,000
Nah, I'm just cleaning stuff up.
Trying to get organised.

430
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,120
We're looking for a man
named Aaron Hallam.

431
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,880
Have you seen him?
Not for a few months.

432
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,720
But you know him? Is this about
his government work?

433
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:50,120
When was the last time you saw him?
I don't know. A few months ago he...

434
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,240
sort of took off.
That's the way he is.

435
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,280
Is he here, Irene?

436
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,320
What's this about?

437
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,200
What's Aaron done?
Have a seat, Irene.

438
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:10,640
Nobody said he's done anything.
FBI wouldn't call if he hadn't.

439
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,040
When did you and Aaron meet?

440
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,240
Eight months ago. He stayed here
a while then just took off.

441
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,520
He tell you where he was going?

442
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:24,080
Ms Kravitz, is he still here?
I said I ain't seen him in months.

443
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,640
How many times do I have to say it?
Excuse me, where are you going?

444
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,520
Irene.
You aren't doing him any good.

445
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,480

your daughter? What has he done?

They've been coming for me

You have to answer

Two SWAT teams on their way.

515
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:32,480
SIRENS WAIL
Get everybody off the bridge!

516
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,040
SIRENS AND RADIOS

517
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,080
No cars!

518
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,040
Leave that car!

519
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,320
Excuse me.

520
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,120
WOMAN SHRIEKS
Hey!

521
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,080
Get down!

522
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,320
Keep this between us!
Don't get in the way.

523
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,800
Get everybody down on the floor.

524
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:21,800
Get down! Down!

525
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:41,600
He's on the tower!
Targeting opportunity!

526
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,000
He's on the tower!

527
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,440
Fire!
GUNSHOTS RING OUT

528
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:04,520
Cease-fire! Cease-fire!

529
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:07,040
Hold your fire!

530
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,920
GUNSHOT

531
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:03,560
I need two, three officers on each
bridge. Sweep the western seawall.

532
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:08,120
Shut all bike paths. SWAT, recon
teams on both sides of the river.

533
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:10,520
Sniper units to cover each team.

534
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:14,360
Forget it. Currents'll take him
and he's like a fish.

535
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,160
This is our show, Bonham.

536
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:20,320
How many people can you lose?
He will kill as many as he can.

537
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,480
So decide an acceptable body count.
Enough!

538
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:27,920
You want more dead? You'll get 'em
if you declare war on my boy.

539
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:32,720
I made him what he is. I can stop
him. We've lost two of our people.

540
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,960
Best I ever served with.
Hallam belongs to us.

541
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,600
DOGS BARK

542
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,520
POLICE RADIOS

543
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,920
WATER ROARS

544
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,720
WATER HISSES

545
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,280
BIRD CALL

546
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,880
CREAKING

547
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,040
ARROW WHISTLES

548
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,720
HE GROANS

549
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:05,600
If he's alive he won't come in.
Right.

550
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,920
Hallam! Get on the ground!

551
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:12,080
WATER POUNDS

552
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:34,120
'God said to Abraham,

553
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,080
'"Kill me a son."'

554
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:52,040
# There's a man goin' 'round
takin' names

555
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,480
# And he decides who to free
and who to blame

556
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:01,520
# Everybody won't be treated
all the same

557
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:06,080
# There'll be a golden ladder
reaching down

558
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:11,120
# When the man comes around

559
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:18,320
# The hairs on your arm
will stand up

560
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:22,880
# At the terror in each sip
and in each sup

561
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,680
# For you partake
of that last offered cup

562
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:32,480
# Or disappear
into the potter's ground

563
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,280
# When the man comes around

564
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,840
# Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers

565
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:46,280
# One hundred million angels singin'

566
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:52,640
# Multitudes are marching
to the big kettle drum... #
