than you know.

856
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:40,560
Card killed my brother,
he tried to kill --

857
00:37:40,628 --> 00:37:42,062
To kill you, too?
[ Chuckles ]

858
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,764
Yeah, Mr. Axe told me
your sad story.

859
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,033
Unfortunately,
the evidence in the hotel room

860
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:48,868
tells a completely different
story.

861
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:50,837
And then there's the fact
that you ran.

862
00:37:50,904 --> 00:37:52,905
I didn't know who was
coming through that door --

863
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:54,373
somebody who wanted
to know the truth

864
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:56,008
or somebody
working with Card.

865
00:37:56,076 --> 00:37:57,143
What <i>is</i> the truth,
Mr. Westen?

866
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,414
[ Sighs ]

867
00:38:01,482 --> 00:38:04,117
Card was running unauthorized
Ops around the globe,

868
00:38:04,185 --> 00:38:06,053
and he wasn't
going to stop.

869
00:38:06,121 --> 00:38:07,922
He used Anson.
He used Gray.

870
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:09,523
He was trying to use <i>me.</i>

871
00:38:09,591 --> 00:38:12,493
Now, I didn't betray my country.
I was trying to <i>protect</i> it.

872
00:38:19,935 --> 00:38:21,669
Whoa.

873
00:38:23,572 --> 00:38:25,806
Now that I know
your side of the story,

874
00:38:25,874 --> 00:38:27,174
I want you to know...

875
00:38:29,277 --> 00:38:31,679
...I don't care.

876
00:38:33,249 --> 00:38:35,617
You killed Tom Card --
one of our own.

877
00:38:35,685 --> 00:38:37,853
And your friends
helped you escape.

878
00:38:37,921 --> 00:38:41,056
You are now enemies
of the United States of America,

879
00:38:41,124 --> 00:38:43,692
and it's my job
to make sure you face justice.

880
00:38:47,397 --> 00:38:49,966
Should take about an hour
to make it back to the road.

881
00:38:50,033 --> 00:38:51,100
[ Snap ]

882
00:38:51,168 --> 00:38:52,435
Good luck
finding a phone.

883
00:38:54,805 --> 00:38:57,307
I'll never stop,
Westen.

884
00:38:57,374 --> 00:39:00,376
I'll hunt you down to the ends
of the earth if I have to.

885
00:39:00,444 --> 00:39:02,378
Then I'll see you there.

886
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:23,766
Mom.

887
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:24,968
Gee--

888
00:39:25,036 --> 00:39:26,636
Michael!

889
00:39:26,704 --> 00:39:28,204
You scared the hell
out of me.

890
00:39:28,272 --> 00:39:29,305
Sorry.

891
00:39:30,974 --> 00:39:32,741
Card's dead.

892
00:39:33,877 --> 00:39:35,243
I killed him.

893
00:39:37,146 --> 00:39:38,279
Good.

894
00:39:38,347 --> 00:39:39,647
He deserved it.

895
00:39:54,328 --> 00:39:57,330
It isn't over, is it?

896
00:39:57,398 --> 00:39:58,832
The CIA's after me.

897
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:01,301
Sam, Jesse, and Fi
helped me escape.

898
00:40:01,368 --> 00:40:03,069
They're hunting us all.

899
00:40:03,137 --> 00:40:04,838
They'll be
coming for <i>you.</i>

900
00:40:06,774 --> 00:40:10,643
I already talked to them.
They came by yesterday.

901
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:11,878
It's all right.

902
00:40:11,946 --> 00:40:14,514
I...pretended I was
some helpless old woman.

903
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:18,151
I served them lemonade
and pretended I was...

904
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:19,319
hard of hearing.

905
00:40:19,387 --> 00:40:20,620
Anyway, eventually
they started talking

906
00:40:20,688 --> 00:40:21,621
like I wasn't even there.

907
00:40:23,658 --> 00:40:25,893
I wrote down
as much as I could remember.

908
00:40:27,195 --> 00:40:29,030
Thanks, mom,
but they'll be coming back.

909
00:40:29,097 --> 00:40:31,666
You still need
to leave.

910
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:33,033
Yeah,
I thought of that.

911
00:40:33,101 --> 00:40:35,870
And then I came up
with a better idea.

912
00:40:35,937 --> 00:40:37,638
I'm staying
right at home.

913
00:40:37,705 --> 00:40:39,106
Ma.

914
00:40:39,173 --> 00:40:42,042
Michael.

915
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,445
If all you guys
are going into hiding,

916
00:40:44,512 --> 00:40:47,481
you're gonna need a lifeline
to the outside world.

917
00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:50,384
You wanted to leave. I think
that's the best thing to do.

918
00:40:50,451 --> 00:40:51,585
And now
you want to stay.

919
00:40:51,652 --> 00:40:53,220
I was angry.

920
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:54,588
I still am.

921
00:40:56,524 --> 00:40:57,824
There's a part of me

922
00:40:57,892 --> 00:41:01,161
that will <i>never</i> get over
what happened to Nate.

923
00:41:04,198 --> 00:41:06,499
If I don't forgive you,
I'll lose <i>you,</i> too.

924
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:09,769
I'm staying.

925
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:15,542
This is a fight
I can't win.

926
00:41:21,782 --> 00:41:23,049
Well,
you have two choices.

927
00:41:24,752 --> 00:41:27,788
You can give up now...

928
00:41:27,855 --> 00:41:30,357
or you can
go down swinging.
