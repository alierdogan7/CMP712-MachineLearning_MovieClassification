1
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,942
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, go check on the car.

2
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:20,909
- Buddy, are you okay?
- Fine. Thanks for asking.

3
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:25,990
Now get your goddamn hands off me
and open the door.

4
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,112
My Ieg !

5
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:32,953
It's broken !

6
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:35,474
Come here.

7
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:41,556
You know the routine, oId man.
Hands behind your back. WaIk!

8
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:46,357
My Ieg ! My arm !

9
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:51,040
- Which is it, your arm or your Ieg?
- Your face.

10
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,602
- Come on, Iet's go.
- Take it easy.

11
00:04:58,322 --> 00:05:02,203
Let 'em aII go. Do it!

12
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,812
Shit!

13
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,701
SteaI the car . . . Go to heII.

14
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:03,464
Let's go, come on.

15
00:06:11,427 --> 00:06:13,587
I toId you I'd get you out.

16
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,031
BiIIy!

17
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,674
It shouId have been me in jaiI,
not you.

18
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:33,994
Do you forgive me?

19
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:39,597
- I forgive you, BiIIy.
- I'm gIad, man.

20
00:06:39,797 --> 00:06:45,679
I couIdn't have that hanging over me
for the rest of my Iife.

21
00:07:24,092 --> 00:07:25,973
BiIIy . . .

22
00:07:37,617 --> 00:07:41,859
- You think that ought to hoId you?
- And some whisky.

23
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:46,220
I wouIdn't seII meat without whisky.
What are you doing up here?

24
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,781
- Hunting.
- In a suit?

25
00:07:52,702 --> 00:07:56,343
- What kind of hunting?
- Pink fIamingos.

26
00:07:56,543 --> 00:08:01,186
The police have rounded up
12 of the 18 escaped prisoners.

27
00:08:01,385 --> 00:08:07,907
The six unaccounted for are to
be considered armed and dangerous.

28
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:12,629
You ever see
any pink fIamingos?

29
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:18,431
No, sir, never have . . .
and never wiII.

30
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:24,473
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

31
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:30,915
How much?

32
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:25,555
- Do we have to go to bed?
- Yes.

33
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:29,436
Thanks for Ieaving me this mess.

34
00:10:34,158 --> 00:10:36,879
And you didn't make your beds.

35
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,920
Mummy, can we get another dog?

36
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:44,281
We'II see, honey. Night-night.

37
00:10:47,323 --> 00:10:52,805
- You too, paI.
- Goodnight, Mum.

38
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:55,446
SIeep weII.

39
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:58,849
- Who named God ''God''?
- God did.

40
00:12:59,048 --> 00:13:05,251
God named God ''God''? Why didn't
he name himseIf Tom or CharIie?

41
00:13:08,532 --> 00:13:11,573
Can I put some saIt on this?

42
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,814
It's okay.

43
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,736
It's okay, it's aII right.

44
00:13:20,936 --> 00:13:24,578
- That's the dynamite again.
- Yes.

45
00:13:24,777 --> 00:13:29,619
- It's okay. Eat your breakfast.
- Where's the saIt?

46
00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:34,341
- It doesn't need any saIt.
- Come on, just a IittIe.

47
00:13:38,182 --> 00:13:45,584
Did you move the saIt shaker?
I don't beIieve this.

48
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:52,307
E.T. took it. He did !
He was here. I heard him Iast night.

49
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:56,908
- E.T.'s make-beIieve, honey.
- He is not. He was here.

50
00:13:57,108 --> 00:14:02,070
- Mookie, stop making things up.
- I'm not!

51
00:14:42,685 --> 00:14:46,566
FROM YOUR BOY
I LOVE YOU, MOOKIE

52
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:54,329
WORLD'S GREATEST DAD

53
00:14:57,409 --> 00:14:59,370
"WorId's greatest dad."

54
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:43,905
Sam, it's Billy. l wish l was there
to split all that money with you.

55
00:15:44,106 --> 00:15:47,987
l guess if you're listening
to this, it's all yours now.

56
00:15:48,187 --> 00:15:52,228
You deserve it for being in prison
all that time because of me.

57
00:15:52,388 --> 00:15:54,630
l wonder where l'm headed.

58
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:59,191
Either way l've got a 50-50 chance
of meeting Elvis.

59
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:05,473
How did you like the suit?
Lay low and stay out of trouble.

60
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:10,194
Sam ... l'm glad l knew you.

61
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:31,863
Come in!

62
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:36,704
Come in, Lonnie.
I want you to meet Mr. Dunston.

63
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:42,107
- Lonnie PooIe.
- He'II be organizing security . . . .

64
00:17:42,307 --> 00:17:44,547
. . . and surveying.

65
00:17:46,988 --> 00:17:52,270
- Don't mind me.
- Mr. Dunston knows our situation.

66
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:56,552
- How are things with Mrs. Anderson?
- I think we'II work it out.

67
00:17:56,751 --> 00:18:01,633
We need her parceI
and the Lewis pIace next to her.

68
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:08,555
It's 1 20 acres, right in the middIe
of the whoIe deveIopment.

69
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:13,677
What's your security training,
Mr. Dunston?

70
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:18,599
- CIeveIand PoIice Department.
- Why did you Ieave?

71
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,001
- Pick a card.
- Take it.

72
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:26,042
Go on, pick a card.

73
00:18:28,443 --> 00:18:33,044
You got it? Put it back in the deck.

74
00:18:35,645 --> 00:18:39,446
This Anderson woman,
are you fucking her?

75
00:18:39,646 --> 00:18:45,568
None of your damn business!
Who is this guy?

76
00:18:45,768 --> 00:18:49,569
I didn't mean anything by it.
I'm sorry.

77
00:18:55,012 --> 00:18:59,053
- Was that your card?
- No.

78
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:03,454
I must be sIipping.

79
00:19:04,295 --> 00:19:09,617
Lonnie, why don't you
go back to work?

80
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:15,739
Good to meet you. Sorry about that.

81
00:19:15,939 --> 00:19:20,781
I'm not too optimistic
about our young friend's success.

82
00:19:20,981 --> 00:19:25,022
Some of these Iandowners
can be hard nuts to crack.

83
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:28,263
Then we use a hammer.

84
00:20:08,597 --> 00:20:11,918
- That was nice.
- It was.

85
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:21,881
- Has he come to see you again?
- I don't want to taIk about this.

86
00:20:22,082 --> 00:20:26,644
They're bIasting at the Braemer's.
Turning the whoIe thing into a Iake.

87
00:20:26,843 --> 00:20:32,605
Yeah, my whoIe house shakes.
So what?

88
00:20:32,806 --> 00:20:38,647
These peopIe . . . when they want
something, they can pIay rough.

89
00:20:38,847 --> 00:20:43,490
What are you saying to me?
I Iive here.

90
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:48,611
- They don't scare me.
- You're something, you know that?

91
00:20:48,811 --> 00:20:53,293
- I'II see you.
- I won't give up my home.

92
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:54,554
E.T. , is that you?

93
00:22:46,012 --> 00:22:49,133
How come you didn't
throw the baII back?

94
00:22:49,332 --> 00:22:53,015
- Did you come from outer space?
- No.

95
00:22:53,214 --> 00:22:58,256
How come you've got a gun?
Are you a bad guy?

96
00:22:58,456 --> 00:23:02,938
No.

97
00:23:03,138 --> 00:23:06,579
- You Iike boobs?
- Sometimes.

98
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:09,940
I think they're totaIIy gross.

99
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:17,063
My name's Mike, but everybody
caIIs me Mookie. What's your name?

100
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:19,143
Sam.

101
00:23:20,103 --> 00:23:25,906
- See you tomorrow, Sam, okay?
- I may not be here tomorrow.

102
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,712
Don't you know how to start a fire?

103
00:23:45,513 --> 00:23:50,114
You have to Iet the air get in
or it's not going to burn.

104
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:57,877
- Are you going to cook something?
- A steak.

105
00:23:58,077 --> 00:24:02,918
Let me have it.
I'II cook it for you.

106
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,680
Mookie?

107
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,763
- Do you have to ruin everything?
- I can be here. Don't boss me.

108
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:19,404
This is my sister Bree. This is Sam.
I'm going to cook him a steak.

109
00:24:19,604 --> 00:24:24,966
- My dad used to Iet me cook.
- You don't remember that.

110
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:29,848
- You were too IittIe. Mum said.
- I remember.

111
00:24:30,448 --> 00:24:34,769
- Where's your dad now?
- Dead. He had a nurdism.

112
00:24:34,969 --> 00:24:38,131
An aneurysm !
Don't you know anything?

113
00:24:38,331 --> 00:24:43,852
- He's in the cemetery.
- He is not.

114
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:50,495
- Mookie? Bree?
- We've got to go. Bye, Sam.

115
00:24:56,137 --> 00:25:00,378
- Don't teII anyone you saw me here.
- Why not?

116
00:25:00,578 --> 00:25:05,620
- He doesn't want us to, aII right?
- I want to teII Mum.

117
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:10,022
- If you do, I'II say you smoke.
- I do not.

118
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:38,472
Mummy . . . What happened to him?

119
00:25:47,794 --> 00:25:50,515
Get away!

120
00:25:57,398 --> 00:25:59,599
Mum, who are these guys?

121
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,361
Stay down !
You're scaring my chiIdren !

122
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:13,804
- Get out of the truck!
- Leave them aIone.

123
00:26:15,645 --> 00:26:18,406
Sam!

124
00:26:18,605 --> 00:26:25,047
- Who the heII are you?
- The parking attendant.

125
00:26:35,491 --> 00:26:37,412
Come on.

126
00:27:14,225 --> 00:27:17,066
Stay here.

127
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:25,069
- Who are you?
- He's my friend. His name is Sam.

128
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:35,912
Are you just going to Iet him
stand there?

129
00:27:38,513 --> 00:27:42,795
- What are you hunting?
- Dear . . . mostIy.

130
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:46,756
Dear is out of season.

131
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:52,078
- Yeah . . . and jack rabbit.
- We've got Iots of rabbits.

132
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:56,319
- There's no hunting on my property.
- I'm mostIy camping.

133
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,601
I don't aIIow camping, either.

134
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:07,163
- Who were those men?
- Come on, kids, up to bed.

135
00:28:07,363 --> 00:28:11,165
- Can't we stay up a IittIe whiIe?
- No, Iet's go.

136
00:28:15,846 --> 00:28:20,647
- We didn't say goodnight to Sam.
- Say goodnight and Iet's go.

137
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:34,052
I'II be right up.

138
00:28:39,214 --> 00:28:43,296
- Where are you from?
- Quebec.

139
00:28:43,495 --> 00:28:47,376
What do you do there?

140
00:28:49,097 --> 00:28:53,579
- What difference does it make?
- It's an innocent question.

141
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,982
I'm a Iawyer.

142
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:05,183
- Where did you Iearn to fight?
- Law schooI.

143
00:29:05,383 --> 00:29:12,826
- Who are those guys?
- Poachers, I suspect.

144
00:29:15,347 --> 00:29:17,748
Thank you for the coffee.

145
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:24,669
Goodnight, ma'am.

146
00:29:31,872 --> 00:29:34,513
Wait!

147
00:29:37,954 --> 00:29:42,396
You can sIeep in my barn
for a night or two, if you want.

148
00:29:43,876 --> 00:29:46,717
No, thanks.

149
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:52,600
- You can hunt here aII you want.
- You don't aIIow hunting.

150
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,682
- I changed my mind.
- You're afraid they'II be back?

151
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:04,403
- Forget it.
- Wait! How much?

152
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:08,204
How much for the barn?

153
00:30:08,405 --> 00:30:14,927
- You don't have to pay me.
- Are you sure?

154
00:30:33,294 --> 00:30:39,215
Out of the way!
Bree, I've toId you about that.

155
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:44,697
You know not to run in front
of the truck. It's not funny.

156
00:30:44,898 --> 00:30:47,459
I'II be right back.

157
00:30:54,781 --> 00:30:59,702
Hi. I thought
you might want to wear these.

158
00:31:53,441 --> 00:31:57,402
- Who the heII are you?
- A friend of CIydie's.

159
00:31:57,603 --> 00:32:01,324

160
00:32:01,524 --> 00:32:06,245
- Have you got some I . D.?
- Sure.

161
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:16,370
- Lonnie?
- I'm naked.

162
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:22,452
- It doesn't bother me. Who's this?
- What are you doing?

163
00:32:22,652 --> 00:32:25,812
He's my cousin . . . from Quebec.

164
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:30,334
- He toId me he was your friend.
- My third cousin.

165
00:32:30,535 --> 00:32:36,056
What's wrong? This is ridicuIous.
Put the gun down.

166
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:41,858
Sorry.

167
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:45,660
Can I taIk to you a second?

168
00:33:35,637 --> 00:33:40,759
- Do you want some more?
- Yeah . . . thanks.

169
00:33:48,121 --> 00:33:51,002
Can you pass the salt?

170
00:34:03,006 --> 00:34:08,968
The oId bike in the barn . . .
I wouId Iike to buy it.

171
00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:12,690
- How much wiII you pay for it?
- I don't know. 200?

172
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:18,771
- 300 . . . take it or Ieave it.
- I'II take it.

173
00:34:20,452 --> 00:34:25,134
- Are you going to go away on it?
- I'II have to fix it first.

174
00:34:25,334 --> 00:34:29,696
It's too broken to be fixed.

175
00:34:33,457 --> 00:34:37,499
He's got a big penis.

176
00:34:37,698 --> 00:34:43,100
- He does!
- He was in the pond washing.

177
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:50,343
He's got an average penis.
I saw it.

178
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:55,465
- AIready?
- That's enought about penises.

179
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:59,226
- Are you going to sIeep in her bed?
- That's enough.

180
00:34:59,426 --> 00:35:03,747
No one's going to sIeep in my bed
except me.

181
00:35:35,198 --> 00:35:41,641
Did you change your mind?
You want to heIp me?

182
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:55,726
It's a damn good offer.
No one eIse wouId offer you that.

183
00:35:55,925 --> 00:36:00,968
I won't seII it to anyone eIse.
I don't want to seII it.

184
00:36:03,688 --> 00:36:07,729
Mrs. Anderson,
I know your financiaI situation.

185
00:36:07,889 --> 00:36:14,211
This might be indeIicate, but you
might not make your payments.

186
00:36:14,412 --> 00:36:18,293
If you can't, the bank
wiII be forced to forecIose.

187
00:36:18,493 --> 00:36:25,136
You bought into the bank.
They never used to do that.

188
00:36:25,336 --> 00:36:28,416
It wiII take a month
to get the order to forecIose.

189
00:36:28,617 --> 00:36:32,138
She'd get a Iawyer.
He wouId fiIe a writ.

190
00:36:32,338 --> 00:36:37,780
That wouId deIay you months.
You wouId have to go to triaI.

191
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,661
If you don't want to seII it,
don't seII it.

192
00:36:42,862 --> 00:36:48,464
- Forgive me . . . Who are you?
- My cousin Sam.

193
00:36:48,663 --> 00:36:53,626
FrankIin HaIe.
I'm deIighted to meet you.

194
00:36:55,586 --> 00:37:00,948
Thank you, Mrs. Anderson.
GentIemen, shaII we?

195
00:37:08,831 --> 00:37:11,831
Astonishing, isn't it?

196
00:37:12,072 --> 00:37:17,714
One IittIe woman in a wheat fieId,
and what is she doing?

197
00:37:17,914 --> 00:37:20,634
She's fucking us up.

198
00:37:23,195 --> 00:37:27,517
My proposed deveIopment
is one of the Iargest of its kind.

199
00:37:28,677 --> 00:37:34,560
It represents a totaI investment
in your community of $1 biIIion.

200
00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:39,521
What we're taIking about here
is naturaI beauty.

201
00:37:39,722 --> 00:37:45,003
I must teII you,
this vaIIey of yours . . .

202
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:52,486
It's one of the most extraordinariIy
beautifuI pIaces I've ever seen.

203
00:37:52,686 --> 00:37:59,728
My company wouId never dream
of desecrating such beauty.

204
00:37:59,928 --> 00:38:03,890
But this town's Iand can be used
so much more efficientIy.

205
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:08,491
Everyone wouId benefit.
I'II guarantee you . . .

206
00:38:08,691 --> 00:38:13,493
You aII shouId be ashamed !
SeIIing off your famiIy heritage.

207
00:38:13,693 --> 00:38:17,334
BuiId your goIf course around me.
I'm not seIIing !

208
00:38:17,534 --> 00:38:22,056
Let him speak.
He has the right to speak.

209
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:27,298
My dear sir, there's bound to be
opposition to a pIan Iike this.

210
00:38:27,497 --> 00:38:35,661
But your eIected counciI peopIe
understand the wisdom of our ideas.

211
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:40,662
I don't care. I know about
the tactics you've been using.

212
00:38:40,862 --> 00:38:44,343
- Nobody takes my Iand from me!
- It's okay, Tom.

213
00:38:44,544 --> 00:38:49,585
- They can't make us seII.
- Are you sure about that, CIydie?

214
00:38:51,266 --> 00:38:55,388
Let's go, honey.

215
00:39:09,393 --> 00:39:13,754
Sam! Something's wrong! Wake up!

216
00:39:17,515 --> 00:39:20,076
It's our neighbour's barn.

217
00:39:24,718 --> 00:39:29,840
Wake up your mum.
Say to caII the fire department.

218
00:39:39,603 --> 00:39:42,804
- Are you okay?
- My husband's in there.

219
00:39:43,004 --> 00:39:47,085
- Stay back!
- PIease, heIp him !

220
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:55,288
Let me heIp.

221
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:02,931
Get that one.

222
00:40:46,586 --> 00:40:49,667
The gas tanks! They're going to go!

223
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:57,030
Move back!

224
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:04,632
- God !
- The tanks are going to bIow.

225
00:41:07,113 --> 00:41:09,193
Get back.

226
00:41:28,881 --> 00:41:31,041
FLAMMABLE

227
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:06,214
Look, it's going to be aII right.

228
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:25,821
- Did you get burned?
- No. I was Iucky.

229
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:30,142
Sam, are you going to go home now?

230
00:42:32,823 --> 00:42:37,024
- Are you going to stay?
- For a whiIe.

231
00:42:37,225 --> 00:42:40,665
You're going home sometime,
aren't you?

232
00:42:44,307 --> 00:42:51,630
I reaIIy don't remember my dad . . .
not Iike I say I do.

233
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:57,551
It's okay.

234
00:42:58,752 --> 00:43:02,513
You did good
in discovering the fire.

235
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:08,155
- I wasn't scared.
- I know.

236
00:43:11,796 --> 00:43:15,117
Goodnight.

237
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:31,003
I've been out here on my own
ever since my husband died.

238
00:43:31,723 --> 00:43:35,325
I aIways thought I couId handIe
whatever came up.

239
00:43:35,524 --> 00:43:40,726
Why am I teIIing you this?
I don't even know you.

240
00:43:40,926 --> 00:43:43,647
Sam . . .

241
00:43:45,808 --> 00:43:50,050
- Is that your reaI name?
- Yes.

242
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:57,572
Sometimes you just get tired.

243
00:43:59,413 --> 00:44:05,415
I'II be okay tomorrow. Things
wiII be better in the morning.

244
00:45:01,954 --> 00:45:06,276
- What's this stuff for?
- That's for the brakes.

245
00:45:06,476 --> 00:45:11,038
- What about this?
- That's gasket seaIer.

246
00:45:11,238 --> 00:45:15,519
- What kind of a car have you got?
- It's a motorcycIe.

247
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,721
- A what?
- A motorcycIe.

248
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:25,802
You're not from around here,
are you?

249
00:45:26,003 --> 00:45:29,684
- Neither are you.
- That's right.

250
00:45:29,884 --> 00:45:35,686
You're that Canadian guy who
puIIed Tom Lewis out of his barn.

251
00:45:35,887 --> 00:45:39,688
- You're him.
- He saved aII the horses, too.

252
00:45:39,887 --> 00:45:45,610
You did? Wow! That must
have reaIIy been something.

253
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,171
- What kind?
- What?

254
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:52,692
What kind of motorcycIe
are you working on?

255
00:45:52,892 --> 00:45:55,653
A Triumph.

256
00:45:55,853 --> 00:46:00,335
They don't make 'em
Iike that any more, do they?

257
00:46:00,534 --> 00:46:04,056
No, they don't.

258
00:46:05,856 --> 00:46:08,818
Let's go.

259
00:46:11,898 --> 00:46:16,380
See you.
Good Iuck with the motorcycIe.

260
00:46:22,742 --> 00:46:27,144
- CouId I Iearn to drive this thing?
- I can show you right now.

261
00:46:27,344 --> 00:46:31,145
I don't reaIIy want to know.
Just as you know what you're doing.

262
00:46:31,345 --> 00:46:35,307
- Don't get caught.
- I thought the Iaw was bought.

263
00:46:35,467 --> 00:46:40,029
- He was paid, but I'm not sure.
- It's not for you to worry about.

264
00:46:40,228 --> 00:46:43,590
- Who's worrying?
- Good.

265
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:48,511
- Is that your card?
- Yeah. How did you do that?

266
00:46:48,712 --> 00:46:50,592
Magic.

267
00:46:54,393 --> 00:46:58,915
- Mummy, is that your wedding?
- Yep.

268
00:47:06,317 --> 00:47:09,599
Come on in.
Do you want some coffee?

269
00:47:09,798 --> 00:47:14,321
Sam, that's my dad.
Come on, Iook at him.

270
00:47:31,126 --> 00:47:38,649
- Why is Daddy carrying you?
- That's what the groom does.

271
00:47:39,809 --> 00:47:45,971
He carries his wife off so they
can start their new Iife together.

272
00:47:47,452 --> 00:47:50,693
- That's me!
- So IittIe.

273
00:48:15,862 --> 00:48:18,903
I bet he was a good kisser.

274
00:48:21,703 --> 00:48:24,264
Yes, he was.

275
00:48:47,993 --> 00:48:51,113
It's very beautifuI here.

276
00:48:53,594 --> 00:49:00,037
It's the vaIIey of the Moon.
That's what we caIIed it.

277
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:03,759
Can you smeII the vioIets?

278
00:49:04,799 --> 00:49:09,200
There's no prettier smeII on earth
than the smeII of vioIets.

279
00:49:15,002 --> 00:49:19,964
You're not used to aII this.

280
00:49:21,844 --> 00:49:26,326
- You're not married, are you?
- I used to be.

281
00:49:26,526 --> 00:49:30,007
A Iong time ago.

282
00:49:42,812 --> 00:49:46,333
You miss your husband, don't you?

283
00:49:49,774 --> 00:49:56,377
Yes . . . there are days
when I miss him very much.

284
00:50:02,779 --> 00:50:06,580
WouId you Iike to sIeep
in my room tonight?

285
00:50:14,903 --> 00:50:18,944
You're a very speciaI woman.

286
00:50:23,386 --> 00:50:27,347
I'II see you tomorrow.

287
00:51:27,448 --> 00:51:33,250
- It's Iate, Lonnie.
- No Iater than it usuaIIy is.

288
00:51:39,652 --> 00:51:45,535
- What's the matter?
- I just don't feeI Iike it.

289
00:51:48,175 --> 00:51:53,297
Are the kids up?
What's the matter?

290
00:51:53,457 --> 00:51:58,739
- Are you upset about the barn?
- It's nothing to do with the barn.

291
00:51:58,899 --> 00:52:04,101
Then what's it about?
You have to Iet me know!

292
00:52:16,865 --> 00:52:20,346
She won't be growing much here now.

293
00:53:53,938 --> 00:53:56,820
Son of a . . !

294
00:54:03,822 --> 00:54:07,424
Strike three. You're out.

295
00:54:12,305 --> 00:54:17,907
This is business, Mr. Dunston.
These things can be compIicated.

296
00:54:18,068 --> 00:54:25,109
If I don't have her Iand by the end
of the week, I Iose my permits.

297
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:29,712
If I Iose my permits,
I'm out of business.

298
00:54:29,871 --> 00:54:34,433
If you and your pissant army
can't persuade this woman to seII, -

299
00:54:34,593 --> 00:54:38,074
- I may have to find
somebody who can.

300
00:55:03,523 --> 00:55:09,605
- What did you find out about him?
- I know he's not her cousin.

301
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:12,486
Good, Lonnie.

302
00:55:12,646 --> 00:55:17,608
I don't care who he isn't.
This asshoIe is reaIIy bothering me.

303
00:55:17,768 --> 00:55:23,850
I'm going to go out there and
persuade him not to stick around.

304
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:28,332
Listen, as a personaI favour,
give me first crack at him.

305
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:32,813
ReaIIy?

306
00:55:34,774 --> 00:55:36,694
Fine.

307
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:57,421
- CIydie's not here.
- I know that.

308
00:55:57,582 --> 00:56:04,024
- I never saw your identification.
- I thought we'd been through this.

309
00:56:04,184 --> 00:56:08,105
Put your hands up against
the barn door. Move!

310
00:56:13,027 --> 00:56:15,868
Spread 'em !

311
00:56:16,828 --> 00:56:20,990
- Are you arresting me?
- Maybe.

312
00:56:24,351 --> 00:56:28,673
- What for?
- I haven't decided yet.

313
00:56:35,955 --> 00:56:39,236
Why don't you just Ieave her aIone?

314
00:56:39,397 --> 00:56:45,639
You're fucking it aII up!
For everybody's sake, just Ieave.

315
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:58,443
If you cared for her,
you wouId not be doing this.

316
00:57:38,897 --> 00:57:41,538
Sam?

317
00:57:42,938 --> 00:57:46,579
What happened?

318
00:57:54,622 --> 00:58:00,225
Does this have anything to do
with what happened Iast night?

319
00:58:03,305 --> 00:58:08,387
- Who did this to you?
- It was personaI.

320
00:58:09,467 --> 00:58:14,149
Why do you do that?
Why don't you taIk to me?

321
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:19,711
Who are you?

322
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:24,393
- Do you want me to go?
- Yes!

323
00:58:25,233 --> 00:58:27,794
No.

324
00:58:27,954 --> 00:58:31,074
I don't know.

325
00:58:36,396 --> 00:58:40,077
I don't know what I want.

326
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,521
And I don't know what I'm doing.

327
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:19,815
- Hi, honey, where's your sister?
- She's pIaying. Where's Sam?

328
01:00:19,975 --> 01:00:23,692
- He's stiII asIeep.
- He's not in the barn.

329
01:00:25,091 --> 01:00:29,688
- He stayed in my room.
- AII night?

330
01:00:29,848 --> 01:00:36,123
- AII right! Can I go see him?
- Let him sIeep a few more hours.

331
01:00:36,283 --> 01:00:40,919
A few more hours?
What did you do to him?

332
01:00:54,468 --> 01:00:59,824
Does this IittIe girI beIong to you?

333
01:00:59,984 --> 01:01:04,221
- Bree, what were you doing?
- He wanted to pIay with me.

334
01:01:04,381 --> 01:01:10,656
He can puII a magic card
out from my ear.

335
01:01:11,695 --> 01:01:18,130
- She was out running around.
- Do I know you?

336
01:01:19,089 --> 01:01:22,966
Go inside.

337
01:01:27,762 --> 01:01:30,280
Bye.

338
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:36,516
I'm surprised to see
that you're stiII here.

339
01:01:36,675 --> 01:01:41,472
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

340
01:01:44,709 --> 01:01:49,465
If I see you near her
or the chiIdren, I'II kiII you.

341
01:01:53,342 --> 01:02:00,217
You seem Iike a smart feIIa.
The woman isn't worth it.

342
01:02:00,377 --> 01:02:06,252
When push comes to shove, you won't
be deaIing with the sheriff . . .

343
01:02:06,412 --> 01:02:10,609
You'II be deaIing with me.

344
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:15,525
I'II Iook forward to it.

345
01:02:16,804 --> 01:02:19,762
Me, too.

346
01:02:26,357 --> 01:02:32,592
- Au revoir.
- Yeah, for now.

347
01:03:03,408 --> 01:03:06,845
The FBI just Ieft my office.

348
01:03:09,723 --> 01:03:15,358
- What do you want?
- I know who you are.

349
01:03:15,518 --> 01:03:21,234
I'II do everybody a favour.
Leave . . . do it right now.

350
01:03:21,394 --> 01:03:27,829
- I won't be abIe to heIp you.
- What about CIydie and this pIace?

351
01:03:27,989 --> 01:03:32,305
You're making it worse for her
than it was ever supposed to be.

352
01:03:32,465 --> 01:03:38,021
If you care for her, you'II go.

353
01:04:01,562 --> 01:04:05,279
Jesus!

354
01:04:19,788 --> 01:04:26,143
I was a thief. There was a bank,
and a guard got shot.

355
01:04:27,382 --> 01:04:32,378
- So you're a murderer.
- No.

356
01:04:37,055 --> 01:04:43,250
A boy, BiIIy . . . I took him with me
on a coupIe of jobs.

357
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:50,164
The guard was going to shoot me.
BiIIy shot him, but I was taken.

358
01:04:50,324 --> 01:04:56,200
Damn you ! You had no right
to come into our Iives!

359
01:05:02,435 --> 01:05:07,711
- You have to go.
- You're going to Iose this pIace.

360
01:05:07,871 --> 01:05:13,666
No, I am not.
I can take care of myseIf.

361
01:05:14,825 --> 01:05:19,102
I was doing just fine
before you came here.

362
01:05:19,262 --> 01:05:23,059
I've been aIone a Iong time.

363
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:26,736
So have I.

364
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:33,564
Clydie, l thought it might be
easier talking to you on tape.

365
01:06:33,724 --> 01:06:36,442
But now l'm not so sure ...

366
01:06:42,797 --> 01:06:45,794
This is exceIIent, Lonnie!

367
01:06:45,954 --> 01:06:50,391
Why did you Iet him go? You'd be
famous now if you'd coIIared him.

368
01:06:50,551 --> 01:06:55,906
Now isn't the perfect time to have
the pIace crawIing with state cops.

369
01:06:56,066 --> 01:07:01,542
- Quite right.
- Lonnie, you're aIways thinking.

370
01:07:01,702 --> 01:07:06,178
It shouIdn't be difficuIt to break
Mrs. Anderson's resistance now.

371
01:07:06,338 --> 01:07:11,774
- I'II work on that right away.
- Thank you, Lonnie.

372
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:23,725
I don't care if he's Ieft town,
I stiII think he's dangerous.

373
01:07:23,885 --> 01:07:27,122
Me, too.

374
01:07:27,282 --> 01:07:31,079
I think we shouId take
personaI charge of the situation.

375
01:07:43,789 --> 01:07:48,545
- Hey, Pete. What's new with you?
- Nothing.

376
01:07:49,744 --> 01:07:53,941
HeIIo . . . Excuse me.

377
01:07:54,101 --> 01:07:58,777
Does that bike parked out front
beIong to you?

378
01:07:58,937 --> 01:08:02,854
- Did you restore it yourseIf?
- It just needed a IittIe work.

379
01:08:03,014 --> 01:08:06,491
- Where are you from?
- Quebec.

380
01:08:06,651 --> 01:08:12,607
- Did you drive it here from Canada?
- Yeah.

381
01:08:14,005 --> 01:08:18,922
- You must be a good mechanic.
- Coffee?

382
01:08:21,919 --> 01:08:26,955
Do you want anything to eat?
Today's speciaI is meatIoaf.

383
01:08:27,115 --> 01:08:31,392
Or you can have
the rest of that guy's steak.

384
01:08:45,141 --> 01:08:47,779
Mookie?

385
01:08:51,376 --> 01:08:57,611
Clydie, l thought it might be
easier talking to you on tape ...

386
01:08:58,091 --> 01:09:01,089
But now l'm not so sure.

387
01:09:01,249 --> 01:09:05,166
l can never change what l did,
no matter how much l regret it.

388
01:09:05,325 --> 01:09:12,200
Mookie will hear things about me.
Most of them won't be true.

389
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:15,118
Please say goodbye to him for me.

390
01:09:15,278 --> 01:09:20,593
l never meant for anyone
to get hurt ... especially him.

391
01:12:51,509 --> 01:12:54,906
Son of a bitch!

392
01:12:55,066 --> 01:12:57,304
Get a chopper up here!

393
01:13:36,754 --> 01:13:40,111
- What are you doing?
- Just Iocking up.

394
01:13:40,271 --> 01:13:44,108
- We never Iock up.
- WeII, we're going to start.

395
01:13:44,268 --> 01:13:47,825
Mummy, are you scared of something.

396
01:13:48,065 --> 01:13:53,061
I'm just being cautious,
that's different from being scared.

397
01:14:09,168 --> 01:14:12,046
CIydie.

398
01:14:28,513 --> 01:14:30,632
Kentucky Avenue.

399
01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:34,429
- Who has that?
- Nobody.

400
01:14:35,148 --> 01:14:38,306
A six. Where am I?

401
01:14:41,503 --> 01:14:46,140
- Run !
- Go get the kids.

402
01:14:48,138 --> 01:14:51,455
What do you want?

403
01:14:57,651 --> 01:14:59,569
Jack, use the stairs.

404
01:15:07,923 --> 01:15:13,238
- Bree, upstairs.
- Open the door, kid.

405
01:15:14,917 --> 01:15:18,754
- I'II go get some heIp.
- You'II faII.

406
01:15:18,914 --> 01:15:21,472
I've done it before.

407
01:15:30,585 --> 01:15:33,822
- Mum !
- Bree.

408
01:15:35,141 --> 01:15:40,817
- The boy went out of the window.
- PIease, don't hurt my chiIdren.

409
01:15:54,206 --> 01:15:57,084
CIydie?

410
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:15,750
- What's the matter?
- Lonnie!

411
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:21,705
Go find the other kid.

412
01:16:37,892 --> 01:16:40,410
I'm over here, jerk.

413
01:16:55,599 --> 01:16:58,037
Come on out, kid.

414
01:17:00,155 --> 01:17:03,792
Come on, son.
I wouIdn't hurt you.

415
01:17:30,411 --> 01:17:34,009
- Sam?
- Stay here.

416
01:17:37,046 --> 01:17:41,723
I'm going to kiII
that IittIe son of a bitch.

417
01:17:51,915 --> 01:17:55,871
No more threats. No more buIIshit.

418
01:17:56,031 --> 01:18:01,867
You know what we're here for.
I'm not going to hurt her.

419
01:18:04,065 --> 01:18:06,943
You stay in there, and no noise!

420
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:11,060
I'm sick of this town !
I want to go home.

421
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:15,456
Now, sign the fucking contract!
Here's a pen.

422
01:18:15,616 --> 01:18:20,013
- I'm sorry it had to come to this.
- Right here.

423
01:18:20,173 --> 01:18:23,850
- very good.
- Go to heII.

424
01:18:28,846 --> 01:18:31,724
Get out now!

425
01:18:31,883 --> 01:18:36,520
- This is my house!
- We can't Ieave before the fire.

426
01:18:39,717 --> 01:18:44,673
- I can't take the risk.
- AI, if you wiII.

427
01:18:56,984 --> 01:19:00,181
Watch her.

428
01:19:07,376 --> 01:19:10,653
Where is he?

429
01:20:34,228 --> 01:20:36,946
Get up!

430
01:21:13,957 --> 01:21:17,834
Sam!

431
01:21:17,994 --> 01:21:21,551
Leave him aIone.

432
01:22:04,597 --> 01:22:08,914
- Sam.
- Are you okay?

433
01:22:09,074 --> 01:22:11,232
Just stay behind me.

434
01:22:50,801 --> 01:22:53,879
Au revoir, fucker!

435
01:22:57,876 --> 01:23:01,953
- CIydie!
- Sam !

436
01:23:02,113 --> 01:23:05,790
- Don't come any cIoser.
- Let her go.

437
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:09,747
Don't even think of it.

438
01:23:17,541 --> 01:23:22,177
Throw the gun down !
Throw the gun down now!

439
01:23:24,295 --> 01:23:26,973
Throw the gun down.

440
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:34,967
- Bree.
- Mum !

441
01:23:36,686 --> 01:23:42,641
- Put your hands over your head.
- I own haIf this vaIIey.

442
01:23:42,801 --> 01:23:47,597
- There's an escaped convict inside.
- Turn around and face the house.

443
01:23:47,757 --> 01:23:51,914
Go! You can stiII get away.

444
01:23:53,473 --> 01:23:58,908
Sam GiIIen ! The house is surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.

445
01:23:59,068 --> 01:24:04,464
Why do they want you?
You didn't do anything wrong.

446
01:24:08,261 --> 01:24:11,978
A Iong time ago, I did some things
I was not supposed to do.

447
01:24:13,297 --> 01:24:16,934
- WiII they take you to jaiI?
- Yes.

448
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:22,890
- I don't want you to go.
- I've got to go.

449
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:30,923
Goodbye, Mookie.

450
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:38,318
Goodbye, Bree.

451
01:24:38,477 --> 01:24:41,835
Are you coming back?

452
01:24:57,183 --> 01:25:01,739
I'II find a way. Somehow I'II find
a way to come back to you.

453
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:08,294
No matter how Iong it takes,
we'II be here.

454
01:25:08,454 --> 01:25:11,572
I know.

455
01:25:24,561 --> 01:25:29,518
- I Iove you.
- I Iove you, too.

456
01:25:42,068 --> 01:25:47,184
You saved a Iot of Iives here.
That ought to count for something.

457
01:26:35,506 --> 01:26:39,143
Goodbye, my friend.

458
01:26:39,303 --> 01:26:42,541
Goodbye, Sam.

459
01:26:46,857 --> 01:26:49,415
Go.

460
01:27:03,284 --> 01:27:07,841
You bastard !
Do you know who I am?

461
01:27:17,953 --> 01:27:21,550
I know what you are.
