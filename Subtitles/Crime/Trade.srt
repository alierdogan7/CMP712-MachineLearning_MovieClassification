Where did you get it?

10
00:04:26,607 --> 00:04:28,086
What a nice bicycle!

11
00:04:29,207 --> 00:04:30,481
Yes it's fantastic,

12
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:33,646
And it has a basket, side pockets, and it's 18 speed.

13
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:36,483
These friends of yours, who are they?

14
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:39,359
They help me with stuff, mom.

15
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:40,756
Yea? What stuff?

16
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:43,960

00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:53,044
We take tourist on tours around the city,
i do it in english.

19
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:55,007
What else?

20
00:04:55,247 --> 00:04:56,600
I got many brains!

21
00:04:58,247 --> 00:04:59,566
Later, princess.

22
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,357
All right, come with me, and i'll show you around.

23
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:06,166
No, it's too dangerous, with all these foreigners.

24
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:07,926
Why do you act like this?

25
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:10,603
Mom, i bought it, it's paid for.

26
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:14,403
Why can't you behave, like your sister for an example..

27
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:19,679
You wouldn't talk to me like this, if your father was here.

28
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:21,326
Well he's not here!

29
00:05:28,487 --> 00:05:29,522
Be back later, mom.

30
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:33,126
Will you be back later today to spend the night?

31
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:35,916
You will be back later, no?

32
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:40,242
You can't use this bike, i forbid it.

33
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,840
Why not? The lord created bicycles for this purpose.

34
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:47,238
The lord did not create bicycles, and i wont let you ride it!

35
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:54,358
Time is money, my friends!
I got to run!

Exuse me, but there's something wrong?

55
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:20,522
What's wrong?

56
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:24,802
The passports.

57
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:28,682
Forgive me, but why have you taken our passports?

58
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:30,521
Visas.

59
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:33,884
But we already have visas.

60
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:42,762
Shut up, don't forget we know where your parents live,
and we also know about your little son.

61
00:08:20,487 --> 00:08:24,320
Hey! What's up my friend?
You're alone?

Mui... cool... suave?

66
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:35,939
Hey! But you got to take a look mr. Cool.
Look, just look.

67
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:39,080
Please, look... look... just a second.

68
00:08:39,327 --> 00:08:42,521
Here... please

69
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,357
You want a true mexican experience?

70
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:50,521
We got treasures that look better then these fucking pyramids.

71
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:54,800
Your dollars will go a long long way down here.

72
00:08:55,727 --> 00:08:58,321
The one on the left there - Rosita, la ra rosita.

73
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:03,363
She's first class, she gives real good head.

74
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:15,559
Come on! We're close.

75
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:30,758
Forgive me my friend, you wont get to taste today
any mexican pussy.

76
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:32,402
Don't kill me.

77
00:09:32,607 --> 00:09:36,680
Yes sir you'll be giving us everything, ok.

78
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:39,957
You know what, if i was you?
I bet you hate all mexicans right now.

79
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:45,443
Guys, what do we do to gringos?
Who disrespect the mexicans?

80
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:49,715
Show him!

81
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,480
Die bitch.

82
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:44,403
Down with americans, america sucks!

83
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:51,002
To my brother with love, from adriana.

84
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:22,600
No! No! No!

85
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:43,120
Look's like they're enjoying themselfs.

86
00:12:44,007 --> 00:12:45,360
You're not kidding!

87
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:50,402
Hey! This bicycle looks familier.

88
00:12:52,127 --> 00:12:55,516
Hey! Hey...
stop!

89
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:01,799
What's the matter? What's going on?

90
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:05,396
What's the matter?

91
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:12,482
Hey you, son of a bitch,
you stole my sister bicycle.

92
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:13,881
No! I found it in the street!

93
00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:15,202
Tell that to your mother!

94
00:13:15,447 --> 00:13:16,596
Realy!
Realy!

95
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:17,842
I found it beleave me!

96
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:19,395
Alright!
Alright!

97
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:21,995
I'll show you, where i found it!

98
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:24,395
Let's go! Hurry up move! Faster!

99
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,486
Show me! Where you found it?

100
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,882
Right there.

101
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:50,882
Hey!

102
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,236
Hey! Where you going?

103
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:20,159
Jorge, what are you doing?
That was my sisters!

104
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,720
Why?, why?

105
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:28,078
Did you see the girl on the bicycle?

106
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,320
My son is a sleep, and i can't...
god help you.

107
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:36,121
Nobody saw a damn thing,
it's time to go and see don victor.

108
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:40,326
Let's go!

109
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:51,076
If she was taken in this part of city,
it means the russian took her.

110
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:52,966
Russian?

111
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:54,322
They're animals.

112
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,438
They buy and sell anything they get there hands on.

113
00:14:57,727 --> 00:14:59,797
A pretty girl, like your sister, it's very possible,

114
00:15:00,047 --> 00:15:02,436
And for them a virgin... is solid gold.

115
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:08,066
She's only 13, don victor.
Please tell me, where i can find her!

116
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:10,520
Help me please!
With the russian?

117
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:12,042
They're everywhere.

118
00:15:12,247 --> 00:15:14,044
Heard about globalization?
It's rediculess.

119
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,276
How about in mexico city, don victor.

120
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,758
What are you gonna do?
Go there and knock on his door?

121
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,922
I am not afraid of them.
Besides, my friends will back me up.

122
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:34,163
These two blockheads?
Look at them!

123
00:15:34,647 --> 00:15:36,797
You don't have any idea about the russian!
You guys wont be a treat to them

124
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:38,681
They will go with me!

125
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:47,999
Why the long faces?
Are we not in fact brothers?

126
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,761
She is my sister, god damn!
You chickenshits!

127
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:55,876
It's my sister, for christ sake!
Kiss my ass, jerkoffs!

128
00:15:57,007 --> 00:15:58,520
Calm down!
Calm down!

129
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:03,159
Calm down right now!
Stay calm!

130
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:05,645
Take it easy...
easy.

131
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:12,838
If they really taken her, she's probably in route by now.

132
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,041
In route where?

133
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:19,487
After they kidnapp the girls, they get'm across the border

134
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:27,521
As soon as possible and there they sell them, they do the same thing over and over again.

135
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,196
If it is who i think it is, they always use the same routine.

136
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:34,923
They stay usually in a place close by the airport.

137
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:41,202
And they get more money if they sell them to...
pedophiles.

138
00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:57,962
Thanks you

139
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:00,962
In there

140
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:10,999
Don't touch me, please.

141
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:18,837
Come on, lay down and enjoy yourself.
We know, where your son is.

142
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:55,523
Mexico - The cheapest way there?

143
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,437
This here is the best choice.

144
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:09,124
I need to make some money, so i can take my son to america.

145
00:18:19,327 --> 00:18:20,919
Mom is back!

146
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:29,605
You'll be very happy with this travel package, i agree it's the best way,

147
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:34,206
The names and the address of my parents, is that realy necessary?

148
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:36,796
Usual bureaucratic procedure.

149
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:49,087
It's here.

150
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:58,076
Why! Is it necessary for us to be here?

151
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,246
No it's not necessary.

152
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:51,641
Take this.

153
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:27,245
Vitamins... i'll help for the pain.

154
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:36,277
Take it,
understand!

155
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:36,244
Do you speak spanish?

156
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:43,286
English?

157
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:46,166
A little.

158
00:21:46,527 --> 00:21:49,200
Me too... a little.

159
00:21:59,847 --> 00:22:01,724
I wish all this would end.

160
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:09,081
I want to go home, i miss my mother.

161
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:23,919
You believe in it?

162
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,319
You pray to it?

163
00:22:32,607 --> 00:22:36,236
Yes.
Very strong.

164
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:41,918
She's great, she'll make my brother to find me.

165
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:44,800
You have a brother?

166
00:22:46,127 --> 00:22:47,640
That's good.

167
00:22:58,847 --> 00:23:00,439
Hey! Hello!

168
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:03,995
Did you see a girl, about this tall, with long hair?

169
00:23:04,527 --> 00:23:06,916
Dark hair, brown eyes, very pretty?

170
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:08,800
No.
- Thanks.

171
00:23:14,247 --> 00:23:17,500
This tall, long dark hair, with a ribbon?

172
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:19,002
No.

173
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:20,295
Did you see her?

174
00:23:21,087 --> 00:23:21,822
No.

175
00:23:22,087 --> 00:23:24,218
Dark hair, dark eyes, like yours.

176
00:23:24,227 --> 00:23:26,924
We got to go, hurry up, hurry...

177
00:23:27,527 --> 00:23:29,165
Did you see a little girl?

178
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:31,365
Did you see a little girl, that tall?

Not everyone is your enemies, you
know. Try a little optimism sometime.

535
01:04:09,063 --> 01:04:10,178
It wont kill you.

536
01:04:11,502 --> 01:04:13,378
And be like you, and end up with a cat?

537
01:04:23,576 --> 01:04:26,169
Sorry, i didn't mean it like that.

538
01:04:30,972 --> 01:04:32,120
When is the auction?

539
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:36,123
Soon, i like to be in new jersey
when it happends wouldn't you?

540
01:04:37,049 --> 01:04:38,083
Do you drive?

541
01:04:38,568 --> 01:04:40,239
You want me to drive?

542
01:04:40,487 --> 01:04:41,522
I'm tired.

543
01:04:41,766 --> 01:04:43,643
But if i drive, we need
to play another music.

544
01:04:43,925 --> 01:04:45,358
What is your problem with my music?

545
01:04:46,124 --> 01:04:48,557
It puts me to sleep, you want
us to get killed or something?

546
01:04:55,399 --> 01:04:56,798
You can't stay here.

547
01:04:56,999 --> 01:04:59,830
Two guys and three girls, that's
to many! It's gonna look suspicios!

548
01:05:02,475 --> 01:05:04,864
It's only two girls.

549
01:05:05,193 --> 01:05:08,831
Have you gone cracy? Look i
know that, we leave tomorrow.

550
01:05:11,751 --> 01:05:12,785
What?

551
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:14,184
Nothing.

552
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:24,661
Hello? How you doing?

553
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:31,572
Listen, we've been on the
road day and night, simply...

554
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:36,412
Okay calm down, calm down.

555
01:05:38,377 --> 01:05:39,855
All right, i've got it. Yea.

556
01:05:42,415 --> 01:05:49,045
Son of a bitch. They set up
the next auction for tomorrow.

557
01:05:49,452 --> 01:05:50,725
You've got to be kidding me.

558
01:05:50,971 --> 01:05:54,757
That's what they want, she's next.

559
01:05:55,728 --> 01:05:58,036
We have to be in new jersey by tomorrow.

560
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:02,201
That's unreal.

561
01:06:05,683 --> 01:06:06,718
Get up.

562
01:06:09,521 --> 01:06:11,112
Get up!

563
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:23,148
Good morning.

564
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:16,125
Good morning. What kind of cop are you?

565
01:07:16,886 --> 01:07:18,921
I'm in the fraught department.

566
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:20,194
What kind of fraught?

567
01:07:20,484 --> 01:07:21,803
Insurance, mainly.

568
01:07:22,763 --> 01:07:24,957
You work for insurance companies?

569
01:07:25,522 --> 01:07:26,590
Well, yes.

570
01:07:27,161 --> 01:07:29,628
I think, you work for the wrong side.

571
01:07:43,593 --> 01:07:45,105
You have mexicans friends?

572
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:48,023
I have mexicans friends.
A very good friend in fact.

573
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:51,341
He works in the office
right next to mine.

574
01:07:51,788 --> 01:07:53,584
You only have one mexican friend?

575
01:07:55,346 --> 01:07:56,859
A good friend.

576
01:07:58,385 --> 01:08:01,295
How can you live in texas, and not
have hundreds of mexican friends?

577
01:08:04,182 --> 01:08:07,172
Okay wise ass do you have
a hundred american friends?

578
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:08,972
All my friends are americans.

579
01:08:09,139 --> 01:08:10,174
Really?

580
01:08:10,459 --> 01:08:11,493

All mexicans are americans, and all my friends
are mexicans, so, all my friends are americans.

01:08:17,935 --> 01:08:21,050

People from agency came by.

612
01:11:26,557 --> 01:11:28,036
They've taken them from me.

613

621
01:13:29,294 --> 01:13:38,846

01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,953
Come in.

623
01:16:40,155 --> 01:16:41,190
You're late,manual.

624
01:16:43,034 --> 01:16:44,102
Here.

625
01:16:51,469 --> 01:16:52,663
Sit down.

626
01:16:59,185 --> 01:17:00,504
Your, probably adriana, yes?

627
01:17:02,864 --> 01:17:03,898
Yes.

628
01:17:04,783 --> 01:17:12,174
What a beautiful name.
Is this what everyone calls you?

629
01:17:15,457 --> 01:17:18,254
You have no idea, how to
deal with young girls, do you?

630
01:17:20,295 --> 01:17:21,807
Where are the other girls?

631
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:32,163
You hear me? Where are the other girls?

632
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:40,041
The brazilians kept one of them, and the other...

633
01:17:40,684 --> 01:17:43,754
We lost on the way here,

634
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,994
She had an accident.

635
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,994
Which one?

636
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:52,346
Which one?

637
01:17:52,598 --> 01:17:54,110
The one from poland.

638
01:17:54,957 --> 01:17:56,594
Another accident?

639
01:17:58,115 --> 01:18:02,868
One more accident, and we wouldn't have any
buisness at all

640
01:18:03,352 --> 01:18:04,831
Looks like you can't handle this job.

641
01:18:05,191 --> 01:18:09,068
You have to deal with vadim on this
and it's not going to be very pleasant.

642
01:18:10,669 --> 01:18:11,896
What a loser.

643
01:18:15,666 --> 01:18:17,098
You're an impocill.

644
01:18:19,264 --> 01:18:21,493
Let's go, adriana, we got things to do.

645
01:18:22,702 --> 01:18:25,579
I'm leaving got to take care of buisness.

646
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:39,329
Hello! Welcome to the holiday inn, how may i help you?

647
01:18:39,933 --> 01:18:41,809
I need two rooms if you got them.

648
01:18:42,052 --> 01:18:43,246
Single or double, sir?

649
01:18:43,492 --> 01:18:44,606
Let's see what you got..

650
01:18:46,490 --> 01:18:51,323
It's fake. You have internet here?

651
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,239
Sure, in the amusment center overthere.

652
01:18:54,046 --> 01:18:55,922
The passwords is (?), right?

653
01:18:57,324 --> 01:18:59,200
Would you like to pay on a credit card?

654
01:19:01,522 --> 01:19:05,115
Excuse me, my wallet is here.

655
01:19:06,522 --> 01:19:08,115
Be right out.

656
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:13,754
Hey... 2 pm

657
01:19:14,755 --> 01:19:17,347
Here is your room key, you go up and get some rest.

658
01:19:17,834 --> 01:19:19,869
I'll be in his office, i'm going overthere now.

659
01:19:22,272 --> 01:19:25,228
Detective sheridon, how exactly did you get involved in this case?

660
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:27,859
Ray not only investigates insurance fraught.

661
01:19:28,069 --> 01:19:30,627
But in resent ocations he also get's involved with...

662
01:19:31,547 --> 01:19:35,663
Detective jefferson, no offence, but i like to hear the story fom detective sheridon himself.

663
01:19:36,544 --> 01:19:39,894
The bottom line is, this girl will be auctiont of in a few hours,

664
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:43,939
And i need to know what you guys gonna do about that auction,

665
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:48,455
Look we've been monitering this group for quit some time.

666
01:19:49,378 --> 01:19:51,492
We know where there jersey oporations are.

667
01:19:52,176 --> 01:19:54,928
Ray, the real problem is that this thing is global

668
01:19:55,734 --> 01:19:59,850
Even though this group might be based in mexico city, they have oporations all over the u. S..

669
01:20:00,492 --> 01:20:01,890
And over every one of the continents.

670
01:20:02,091 --> 01:20:05,001
Their server for example, is located somewhere in maldives.

671
01:20:05,529 --> 01:20:07,280
Their banking is in south africa.

672
01:20:07,808 --> 01:20:09,718
There are many jurisdictions at work here

673
01:20:09,927 --> 01:20:12,917
Cia, state department, the
interpol extr... extr...

674
01:20:13,445 --> 01:20:19,152
So what we do is fallow the money, connect all the dots and we'll come up with the source.

675
01:20:20,282 --> 01:20:25,670
I get all that, but you know where the oporation is in new jersey.

676
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:27,038
Yea.

677
01:20:27,838 --> 01:20:31,955
But you can't be bother and do anything about this little mexican girl,

678
01:20:31,996 --> 01:20:34,863
You got bigger plans.

679
01:20:35,993 --> 01:20:40,030
That's what you're saying, or did i hear you wrong?

680
01:20:41,391 --> 01:20:43,108
Well gentlemen, if you excuse me?

681
01:20:44,829 --> 01:20:45,863
Thanks you

682
01:20:46,428 --> 01:20:47,746
We are the fucking gringos, aren't we?

683
01:20:49,027 --> 01:20:50,061
Sorry?

684
01:20:50,786 --> 01:20:53,617
I said we are the fucking gringos!

685
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:42,869
Hi patty, i'll be home in a few more days.

686
01:21:45,238 --> 01:21:48,930
I want you to take out a big junk
of money from our savings.

687
01:21:48,936 --> 01:21:51,870
But i don't wanna do it unless you say it's
alright.

688
01:21:52,254 --> 01:21:54,823
I guess i wont have to ask, what it's for.

689
01:21:55,712 --> 01:22:00,830
I'll tell you all about it when i get
home, and i promise no more secrets.

690
01:22:01,869 --> 01:22:03,142
Have you found her?

691
01:22:05,507 --> 01:22:06,781
Karla?

692
01:22:08,346 --> 01:22:10,415
Karla that's her name?

693
01:22:13,143 --> 01:22:14,212

694
01:22:15,582 --> 01:22:22,098
Ray... if you find your daughter,
i want you to bring her home.

695
01:22:29,615 --> 01:22:32,111

Thanks you

698
01:22:41,129 --> 01:22:43,358
You shouldn't thank, me for loving you ray.

699
01:22:45,087 --> 01:22:46,565
Bye bye.

700
01:22:56,541 --> 01:22:58,689
Hey, hey, what's going on?

703

707
01:23:29,984 --> 01:23:31,177
It's my daughter.

708
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:32,696
Your daughter?

709
01:23:33,182 --> 01:23:34,296
Yea.

710
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:38,619
This is what you've been looking for?

711
01:23:39,419 --> 01:23:42,807
That picture was taken 10 years ago, i realy don't know what i'm looking for.

712
01:23:51,253 --> 01:23:56,005
I met her mother just after i was married

713
01:23:56,330 --> 01:24:00,965
To patty my wife,
and i was a happely married man

714
01:24:02,767 --> 01:24:08,301
And then i met elenore,
and everything changed. She was...

715
01:24:12,888 --> 01:24:20,192
Oh she was so... wild and alive.

716
01:24:23,916 --> 01:24:27,350
I don't know what i was expecting
but i was ready to give up everything.

717
01:24:29,033 --> 01:24:35,024
My marrige everything, so stupid!
Stupid...

718
01:24:36,269 --> 01:24:42,453
And then she met this other guy and...

719
01:24:42,945 --> 01:24:48,736
He was everything i wasn't, i mean...
she found him exiting... and alive...

720
01:24:50,822 --> 01:24:56,655
Anyway and then she told to me, that she was
pregnant with his child. And a...

721
01:24:58,538 --> 01:25:04,893
That kind of did it, i left and a...
went back to patty

722
01:25:05,134 --> 01:25:06,408
Did patty take you back?

723
01:25:07,613 --> 01:25:08,613
Yeap.

724
01:25:10,532 --> 01:25:11,930
Go figure.

725
01:25:12,531 --> 01:25:14,202
That would never happen in mexico.

726
01:25:21,006 --> 01:25:25,713
Just a few days ago i get a knock at my door from a couble of officers and they told me that elenore has died.

727
01:25:25,864 --> 01:25:27,881
From an overdose.

728
01:25:28,522 --> 01:25:31,558
And they found this letter in her apartment with my name on it.

729
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:35,557
That she's written 10 years
before, but never sent.

730
01:25:36,598 --> 01:25:46,991
And she says she needs money, and that karla is my daughter.

731
01:25:48,032 --> 01:25:51,503
Which i always... wonderd about.

732
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:54,539
You didn't know she had a daughter did you?

733
01:25:57,267 --> 01:25:58,461
I did.

734
01:26:03,984 --> 01:26:06,019
We had our ups and downs years

735
01:26:06,303 --> 01:26:09,179
We helped her out all we could,
but she's always in trouble

736
01:26:09,621 --> 01:26:10,621
And the daughter?

737
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:14,931
In foster homes mostley,
but i always managed to get her back.

738
01:26:17,377 --> 01:26:18,775
After you.

739
01:26:27,252 --> 01:26:31,526
She went over the border to
juarez about ten years ago.

740
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:33,924
Probably at the time when she
wrote you that letter.

741
01:26:34,688 --> 01:26:35,916
Was her daughter with her?

742
01:26:36,447 --> 01:26:37,846
We have no idea.

743
01:26:38,406 --> 01:26:42,920
We do know, that she got back here
two years later,

744
01:26:43,106 --> 01:26:44,320
The girl was gone

745
01:26:44,442 --> 01:26:47,791
And the house was still a mess.
Did you...

746
01:26:47,819 --> 01:26:52,826
Did you ask her what happend to the daughter.

747
01:26:54,317 --> 01:26:57,549
She told us that she left her with her daddy.

748
01:26:57,574 --> 01:27:03,626
We didn't know what kind of daddy she was talking about?
We couldn't proof anything, what are you talking about?

749
01:27:03,633 --> 01:27:09,982
We think, she sold the girl
i don't know, but with junkies that happends

750
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:14,979
She sold her.

751
01:27:18,746 --> 01:27:25,623
If i... if i gotten that letter 10 years before, everythingl would be different.

752
01:27:26,063 --> 01:27:29,834
Me and patty always wanted a child.

753
01:27:32,418 --> 01:27:33,976
She's pretty, ain't she?

754
01:27:35,737 --> 01:27:37,947
Yes, she has beautiful eyes.

755
01:27:38,775 --> 01:27:41,412
Green.. Like her mothers.

756
01:27:46,811 --> 01:27:49,983
So, that's what you where doing in the house in juarez.

757
01:27:50,409 --> 01:27:55,986
Well, by the time you cliemed in to my trunk,
i've pretty much givin' up on everything.

Veronica, i hope, you are happy in heaven.
If you can talk to virgin maria for me,

Sit next to him.

832
01:35:06,724 --> 01:35:08,922

No reason.

835
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:14,135
No reason.

836
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:17,727
Look you remind me of someone

837
01:35:17,898 --> 01:35:19,296
Who would that be?

838
01:35:20,137 --> 01:35:21,928
Some one i knew a long time ago.

839
01:35:22,136 --> 01:35:24,251
You're very nosey

840
01:35:24,314 --> 01:35:26,566
Are you a cop?

841
01:35:26,613 --> 01:35:28,567
No i'm not a cop.

842
01:35:28,612 --> 01:35:31,060
What do you think manual?
I think he's a cop.

843
01:35:31,212 --> 01:35:32,060
Get up!

844
01:35:34,029 --> 01:35:38,988
Look why don't you just give me the girl,
i'm telling you i'm not a cop

845
01:35:39,407 --> 01:35:40,481
Sit down.

846
01:35:40,486 --> 01:35:43,541
You're gonna proof you're not a cop

847
01:35:43,645 --> 01:35:45,816

848
01:35:45,824 --> 01:35:49,594
Easy, first fuck is here.

849
01:35:54,559 --> 01:35:55,359
Sorry?

850
01:35:55,519 --> 01:35:58,347
You gonna fuck the little virgin right here.

851
01:35:58,716 --> 01:36:01,553
That's not part of the deal.

852
01:36:01,555 --> 01:36:07,528
I know. But let's say it's kind of my insurance
policy.

853
01:36:07,593 --> 01:36:11,689
If you're not a cop it means, once you've been with her you wont talk.

854
01:36:11,710 --> 01:36:15,187
But if you're a cop you wont
fuck her and then you're fucking death.

855
01:36:19,586 --> 01:36:21,018
You want some water?

856
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:28,414
So, what's it gonna be?

857
01:36:32,459 --> 01:36:35,734
I think, for this amout of money
i deserved a little privat.

858
01:36:35,977 --> 01:36:41,007
Sure, you can get your very own room

859
01:36:41,068 --> 01:36:42,520
No, no, no,

860
01:36:56,068 --> 01:36:58,920
Go with him.

861
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:05,038
You go and be a nice little girl.

862
01:37:08,441 --> 01:37:14,558
Oh and ah... i wanna see blood on the sheets.

863
01:37:52,538 --> 01:37:57,052
It's okay... i'm not gonna hurt you.

864
01:37:59,774 --> 01:38:05,049
Amigo... i'm a friend of your brothers.

865
01:38:06,074 --> 01:38:07,849

01:38:08,170 --> 01:38:12,521
Jorge your brother, he's here with me.
We're gonna get you out.

01:38:23,562 --> 01:38:24,710

870
01:38:51,051 --> 01:38:52,017

Manual!

872
01:39:39,763 --> 01:39:44,629
Remember, veronica is watching, it's
not to late.

873
01:40:39,212 --> 01:40:40,406
And?

874
01:40:51,966 --> 01:40:55,842
That son of a bitch has already justified your so called insurance policy.

875
01:41:10,556 --> 01:41:15,068
Just what i like to see a satisfied customer

876

883
01:42:46,028 --> 01:42:47,338
Stay on the ground! Show me your hands!

884
01:42:47,986 --> 01:42:49,976
Please. Please.

885
01:42:53,803 --> 01:42:56,055
