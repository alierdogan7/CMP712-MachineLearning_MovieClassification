The mary lou retton,

3
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:10,128
Oh! Oh!

4
00:00:10,162 --> 00:00:11,593
Okay.

5
00:00:11,628 --> 00:00:13,857
So, as you can see,

6
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:17,854
<i>Even if marvin and nancy wanted
to join the the mile high club</i>

7
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:20,858
En route to vegas,
it was impossible.

8
00:00:20,893 --> 00:00:22,898
You see,
ladies and gentlemen,

9
00:00:22,932 --> 00:00:25,600
Physics prevents sex
in any position

10
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:27,434
In a southcal airlines
bathroom.

11
00:00:27,468 --> 00:00:29,366
Simple misunderstanding.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,333
Like the time
you tried to argue

13
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:32,898
That an energy drink
caused insanity.

14
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,363
Boys, when are you
going to learn

15
00:00:35,397 --> 00:00:37,630
That these charades only
obfuscate your client's defense?

16
00:00:37,665 --> 00:00:39,432
Is that
a rhetorical question?

17
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:41,802
Is "obfuscate"
a real word?

18
00:00:44,504 --> 00:00:45,669
Oh, come on,
your honor.

19
00:00:45,704 --> 00:00:47,371
You usually give us
a warning first.

20
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:49,537
This seems a little excessive,
don't you think?

21
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:51,505
Okay.
Judge derek kohler?

22
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,906
Yes.
You're under arrest

23
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,441
For obstruction of justice
by a judicial officer.

24
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:57,509
This is outrageous!

25
00:00:57,543 --> 00:00:59,611
There's been a mistake.

26
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:03,450
Will you...
Please come with me?

27
00:01:03,484 --> 00:01:05,617
Does this mean
we get a do-over?

28
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:07,918
Please.

29
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:13,625
The d.A.'s office has accused me
of having an affair

30
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:14,993
With margaret pollock

31
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:16,628
While presiding over a number
of her cases.

32
00:01:16,663 --> 00:01:18,563
pollock?
No way!

33
00:01:18,598 --> 00:01:19,931
Total ice queen.

34
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:21,499
You know what? Put us on
the stand, we'll testify ...

35
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:22,800
Remember when you tried
to hit on pollock

36
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:23,901
At the bar association party?

37
00:01:23,936 --> 00:01:25,570
Yeah.
Ugh!

38
00:01:25,604 --> 00:01:26,771
Margaret and I
are in love.

39
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:28,305
He meant "ice queen"
in a good way.

40
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,508
<i>I never hit on her.
You hit on her.</i>

41
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:33,109
Officers, uh, I'd like to confer
with my attorneys alone.

42
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:34,811
Two minutes.

43
00:01:37,447 --> 00:01:39,514
Why is he ...
why is he looking at us?

44
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:40,982
Gentlemen...

45
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,618

Damien.

52
00:02:15,784 --> 00:02:16,884
Hey.

53
00:02:16,918 --> 00:02:18,319
Friends don't
shake hands.

54
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:22,456
Uh, yeah, okay.

55
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,359
Last time I checked,
we weren't friends.

56
00:02:25,393 --> 00:02:26,760
Oh, after 20 years,

57
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:28,496
You're still pissed
about the theta spring formal?

58
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,431
Uh, yeah, you mean the one
where you broke my nose.

59
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:33,934
What can I do
for you, lance?

60
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:37,771
Okay, if you don't want
a friend, how about a client?

61
00:02:37,806 --> 00:02:40,074
I'm listening ... barely.

62
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:41,642
About three months ago,

63
00:02:41,676 --> 00:02:44,512
I joined the gay softball
association of california

64
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:45,613
To meet guys.

65
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:47,982
My team won
the championship,

66
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:50,584
But now somebody at g-sac
is accusing us

67
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:51,953
Of heterosexual cheating.

68
00:02:51,987 --> 00:02:53,488
Wait a second.

69
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:55,690
I'm gay, damien.

70
00:02:55,724 --> 00:02:58,059
no, you're not.
What? You ... what?

71
00:02:58,093 --> 00:03:00,428
You banged, like,
every 8, 9, and 10 on campus.

72
00:03:00,463 --> 00:03:01,896
I just don't want
to live a lie anymore.

73
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,898
Um, okay.

74
00:03:03,932 --> 00:03:06,800
And you need a lawyer
to help you get your...?

75
00:03:06,835 --> 00:03:08,001
G-sac.

76
00:03:08,036 --> 00:03:09,569
...Your g-sac trophy back.

77
00:03:09,604 --> 00:03:11,404
Yeah,
they don't believe I'm gay.

78
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,439
All right. Well, uh, listen,
good luck with that.

79
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:14,807
I-I can't help you.

80
00:03:14,842 --> 00:03:16,576
Our firm doesn't take
frivolous lawsuits.

81
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,812
Didn't I read you're considering
running for judge?

82
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:21,548
Yeah,
something like that.

83
00:03:21,582 --> 00:03:24,250
This could really put you on
the map with the gay community.

84
00:03:27,755 --> 00:03:31,824
And I could count on you
for their support?

85
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:33,493
Damien,
you get me out of the closet,

86
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:34,827
I will put them
in the voting booths.

87
00:03:34,862 --> 00:03:36,996
All right.
You tell your team,

88
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:38,464
By the time I'm done,

89
00:03:38,499 --> 00:03:41,067
G-sac won't even be able
to think straight.

90
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:46,973
You never answered why you want
peter and me defending you.

91
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:48,908
<i>You hate us.</i>

92
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:52,879
I assumed that if anyone
could relate to my predicament,

93
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:54,847
It would be you, mr. Bash.

94
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:58,184
<i>Janie ross and I never violated
any ethical boundaries.</i>

95
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:02,321
Maybe blurred a few.
A couple.

96
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:04,923
And behind the sideshow
that is franklin and bash,

97
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,692
I think you two
show great potential.

98
00:04:06,726 --> 00:04:07,860
The way you fight
for your clients...

99
00:04:07,894 --> 00:04:09,194
Aww.

100
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:13,832
Here's the evidence
against me.

101
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:15,634
There was
an anonymous package

102
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:17,836
Delivered to the d.A.'s office
claiming you and d.A. Pollock

103
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:20,773
Have been dating
since January 2009.

104
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:22,741
Someone's got
their timeline wrong.

105
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:24,476
I presided over
margaret's cases in 2009,

106
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:25,944
But we didn't start dating
until 2010.

107
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,380
And I proposed
seven months later.

108
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:30,315
I have recused myself
every time

109
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,384
We've found ourselves
paired together in court.

110
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:34,387
<i>It's me.
That's you.</i>

111
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:35,688
<i>Watching you in court today
in that pantsuit...</i>

112
00:04:35,723 --> 00:04:36,856
<i>hmm.</i>

113
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:39,359
<i>All I can say is...</i>

114
00:04:39,393 --> 00:04:41,861
<i>Res ipsa loquitur.</i>

115
00:04:41,896 --> 00:04:44,031
You phone sex in latin?
Really?

116
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:45,532
That's freaky.

117
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:47,234
<i>March 7, 2009, 4:00 a.M.</i>

118
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:50,305
<i>We slam the door, and I lift
you up onto your desk.</i>

119
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:51,973
<i>You bite my lip, draw blood.
That's hot.</i>

120
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:54,677
<i>And I smile, because you're
not wearing any panties.</i>

121
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,645
No, j-just hit the stop button.
Please, just turn it off.

122
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,013
That one's better.

123
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,682
I mean, it's incredibly
damaging to our case,

124
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,016
But you're getting there ...
it's a strong effort.

125
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,818
Confidence.
Yeah.

126
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:04,387
Margaret, I'm so sorry
that they heard that.

127
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:06,289
They have to
know everything.

128
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:07,490
Gentlemen.
Hi.

129
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:08,824
Are you all right?

130
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:10,326
I've had better days,
sweetie.

131
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:11,928
D.A. Pollock,

132
00:05:11,962 --> 00:05:14,463
Do you admit
receiving those messages?

133
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:15,998
In 2010, not 2009.

134
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:17,666
Someone must have altered
the time-stamp.

135
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:19,235
That's hard to do,
your honor.

136
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:20,769
Yeah, that's like
black-op, nba stuff.

137
00:05:20,804 --> 00:05:22,338
He means nsa.

138
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:26,008
I am telling you,
someone is trying to set me up.

139
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:27,876
If you guys
weren't together in 2009,

140
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,011
Why can't you just get your
office to call off the dogs?

141
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:32,314
Believe me, I tried.
No one will talk to me.

142
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:34,850
I'm suspended, pending the
outcome of the investigation.

143
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:36,952
Our fate rests
on your ability

144
00:05:36,986 --> 00:05:38,988
To convince a jury
of my innocence.

145
00:05:40,724 --> 00:05:43,626
There something's wrong
with the anonymous information.

146
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:45,896
Pollock and kohler are too smart
to be that stupid.

147
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,765
<i>What if they are
that stupid?</i>

148
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:50,401
Well,
he's looking at 23 years ...

149
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:53,505
One year for each case he tried
with d.A. Pollock.

150
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:55,306
Opening up a future seat
on his bench.

151
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,840
Hm. Sounds like
a win-win to me.

152
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,575
Right, uh, damien...

153
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,279
Where are you at with your...
Boyfriend from college?

154
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:04,481
<i>Lance is a boy,
and he was a friend.</i>

155
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:06,383
They're two separate nouns.

156
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:08,718
Oh, my god.
You americans are so uptight.

157
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:10,653
You know, I once experienced

158
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,756
A most marvelous
polysexual awakening

159
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,860
In 1976 on old compton street.
It was...

160
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:19,629
Okay, the burbank bears
were the worst team

161
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:20,997
In the gay league
before lance joined.

162
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:22,532
Now, when we were at s.C.,

163
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:24,400
He set the season
strikeout record twice.

164
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:26,269
So your boyfriend's
a pitcher.

165
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,905
The league thinks
that lance is a ringer,

166
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:30,540
Which is why
I'm pushing forward

167
00:06:30,574 --> 00:06:32,842
And suing
for equitable relief.

168
00:06:32,877 --> 00:06:35,946
Damien, I'd be delighted
to partner you on this one.

169
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,016
Let's ... let's get your friend's
championship back, hm?

170
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:43,820
You can't hang our judge
on anonymous info

171
00:06:43,854 --> 00:06:45,055
And a couple of voicemails.

172
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:46,690
He has a right
to confront his accuser.

173
00:06:46,724 --> 00:06:47,991
Thank you,
professor bash.

174
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:49,759
<i>I also went to law school.</i>

175
00:06:49,793 --> 00:06:51,694
Yeah? Then why aren't you
also going after d.A. Pollock?

176
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:53,463
That's
an interesting defense,

177
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,498
Trying to drag down
your client's girlfriend

178
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:56,833
In order to get him off.

179
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:58,468
Remind me never to be
in a life raft with you.

180
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,337
It's selective
prosecution.

181
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:01,672
Kohler is in
a position of power.

182
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:03,507
It's like a civil
sexual-harassment case.

183
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:05,410
Please, you mean
you're going after my client

184
00:07:05,444 --> 00:07:06,711
To protect one of your own.

185
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:09,014
Who we charge
is at our discretion.

186
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,386
There's something else
you're not sharing.

187
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,322
You always tilt your head
like a dog hears a funny noise

188
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:17,490
When you've got a secret.

189
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:18,758
Oh, so now
you're the mentalist?

190
00:07:18,793 --> 00:07:20,426
Chewed-up pens ...

191
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:22,996
Total road flare
for sexual frustration.

192
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,798
Oh, grow up, peter!

193
00:07:24,832 --> 00:07:25,932
Is that fiancé of yours

194
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:27,534
On some sort of
sexual fast again?

195
00:07:27,568 --> 00:07:29,937
You know
nathan and I broke up.

196
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:32,706
He actually moved
to an ashram in india.

197
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,375
Huh. When was the last time
you took some friendly fire

198
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,510
In the sheets?

199
00:07:36,544 --> 00:07:37,778
That is none
of your business!

200
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:39,079
What about you?

201
00:07:39,114 --> 00:07:41,015
Too long.

202
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,355
The night manager
at the pasadena grand hotel

203
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:51,791
Can place kohler and pollock
together in February of 2009.

204
00:07:51,825 --> 00:07:53,626
We're not talking
about voicemails.

205
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:55,595
It's pretty hard to doctor
a live person.

206
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,365
<i>You do not want to take this
to trial, peter.</i>

207
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,767
Then how else
would I get to see you?

208
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:04,138
♪ oooh ♪

209
00:08:04,173 --> 00:08:06,007
♪ I can't let you go ♪
♪ la la la la

210
00:08:07,714 --> 00:08:07,714
+

211
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:11,247
Good hit. Good hit.

212
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,751
Whoa.
Good hit. Good hit.

213
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:18,054
You got to catch that!
Come on!

214
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:20,557
Your devil divas
are very impressive.

215
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:22,626
I suppose it's coincidence
that the captain

216
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,695
Of the losing team
offered his legal services

217
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:26,363
Pro bono to the league.

218
00:08:26,397 --> 00:08:28,065
I'm offended
by your client's insensitivity.

219
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:29,933
See, my team also deserves
that trophy.

220
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,768
Lance admitted
he was homosexual

221
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,737
In the league's
self-declaration form.

222
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:35,372
I have reason
to believe differently.

223
00:08:35,406 --> 00:08:36,640
That's your word
versus his.

224
00:08:36,674 --> 00:08:38,041
And half my teammates

225
00:08:38,075 --> 00:08:39,843
Celebrating his victory
at whiskers nightclub.

226
00:08:39,877 --> 00:08:41,645
He had a few too many
vodka red bulls

227
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,747
And blurted out he had never
dated or slept with a man.

228
00:08:43,781 --> 00:08:45,548
That doesn't ...

229
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,585
I mean, there's a lot of
heterosexual virgins out there.

230
00:08:48,619 --> 00:08:50,787
Part of
the self-declaration form states

231
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,490
That gay means participating
in romantic or sexual behavior.

232
00:08:53,524 --> 00:08:56,493
Well, come on, I mean,
then the league standards ...

233
00:08:56,527 --> 00:08:58,996
Not only are they unfair,
but they're unconstitutional.

234
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,566
While we're discussing
what's fair,

235
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,002
Are you also suing the straight
league that kicked out lance?

236
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:06,637
Yeah, banned for life ...

237
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,640
For charging the mound
after getting hit by a pitch.

238
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,675
Two days before joining
the burbank bears.

239
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,011
You see, the only reason
your client joined our league

240
00:09:14,045 --> 00:09:15,913
Was because his other league
dumped him.

241
00:09:15,947 --> 00:09:18,783
He doesn't love men,
damien.

242
00:09:18,817 --> 00:09:21,819
He loves
competitive softball.

243
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,888
Let's go!

244
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:31,962
How can they say
for certain it was me?

245
00:09:31,997 --> 00:09:34,432
Well, the night manager
at the pasadena grand

246
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:36,801
Says you ordered a 18-year-old
macallan scotch

247
00:09:36,835 --> 00:09:38,870
From room service
on February 19, 2009.

248
00:09:38,904 --> 00:09:41,940
Myself and a hundred
other judges and lawyers

249
00:09:41,974 --> 00:09:45,077
Who attended that bar
association conference
that evening.

250
00:09:45,111 --> 00:09:47,446
But they didn't have
a brunette with them

251
00:09:47,481 --> 00:09:50,082
Who ordered a sparkling
grapefruit water at 1:22 a.M.

252
00:09:50,116 --> 00:09:52,451
You also ordered
an in-room porno,

253
00:09:52,485 --> 00:09:53,819
"real steel,"
20 minutes later.

254
00:09:53,853 --> 00:09:55,488
That's a family movie,
pindy.

255
00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:57,690
This one stars
"huge" jackman.

256
00:09:57,724 --> 00:09:59,058
Some coincidence ...

257
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:00,626
Brunette, fancy water...

258
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:02,562
Questionable family movie.

259
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:04,063
Come on,
the manager is lying.

260
00:10:04,097 --> 00:10:05,631
<i>You've got to know that.</i>

261
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,700
Your honor,
he directly links you

262
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:09,068
To the dates
and to pollock.

263
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:11,104
Janie is going to bury us alive
with this.

264
00:10:11,138 --> 00:10:13,006
We should
just plead you out.

265
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,874
You've been a judge for 20 years
with a spotless record ...

266
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:17,010
No jail time. You get
suspended from the bench
for three years.

267
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:19,178
So, the moment
it gets tough,

268
00:10:19,213 --> 00:10:20,980
Franklin and bash
want to pack it in.

269
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:22,615
What happened to the mavericks

270
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:24,817
That I retained to kick over
the scales of justice?

271
00:10:24,851 --> 00:10:26,919
Stop selling me the case.

272
00:10:26,954 --> 00:10:28,955
Start lawyering the law.

273
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:31,790
Judge, you tried six cases
in '09 with d.A. Pollock.

274
00:10:31,825 --> 00:10:33,492
That's six possible suspects

275
00:10:33,527 --> 00:10:35,795
Who could have their rulings
overturned if you're convicted.

276
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:37,430
They'll go free.

277
00:10:37,464 --> 00:10:39,132
Three of them
aren't serving any time ...

278
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,268
Vandalism, shoplifting, d.U.I.
The others ...

279
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,604
Peter and I already investigated
tori richards,

280
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,206
Who you hit with four years
for robbery.

281
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,941
She's dead.

282
00:10:47,976 --> 00:10:49,143
Probably not a threat.

283
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:50,911
Our fifth suspect,
leroy bryant,

284
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:52,113
Made parole last year

285
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:53,781
After doing two years
for dealing meth.

286
00:10:53,815 --> 00:10:55,750
We haven't been able
to track him down.

287
00:10:55,784 --> 00:10:57,852
I have zero tolerance
for punks like leroy.

288
00:10:57,886 --> 00:10:59,587
If he wants me,
he'll have to stand in line.

289
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:02,690
Well, he'll probably
be behind julian aroyan.

290
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,493
<i>You sent him away
for five years</i>

291
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:08,028
For embezzling
from his nightclub.

292
00:11:08,063 --> 00:11:09,796
I'm gonna get you, kohler!</i>

293
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:11,498
<i>This isn't over!</i>

294
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:13,800
<i>I am gonna hunt you down!</i>

295
00:11:13,835 --> 00:11:15,936
<i>You better hide!</i>

296
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,638
<i>You better hide!</i>

297
00:11:17,672 --> 00:11:18,839
Yeah, I got to think

298
00:11:18,873 --> 00:11:20,674
You're not on
his christmas-card list.

299
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,815
Oh. The league
wants conclusive evidence

300
00:11:27,849 --> 00:11:29,183
Of lance's homosexuality.

301
00:11:29,217 --> 00:11:30,584
oh.

302
00:11:30,619 --> 00:11:32,820
You know, it's a shame
our lads at g-sac

303
00:11:32,854 --> 00:11:35,924
Don't feel gay above the waist
is gay enough to play ball.

304
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,626
I mean,
I still remember the day

305
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,628
When popping the collar
on your polo

306
00:11:39,663 --> 00:11:42,131
Was enough to get you backstage
at "a chorus line."

307
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:44,567
How do we figure out
what makes lance gay?

308
00:11:44,601 --> 00:11:47,036
You guys
are overthinking this.

309
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,005
It's obvious
why lance is gay.

310
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,240
Well, we're not all blessed

311
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:52,242
With your military-grade
gaydar, hanna.

312
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:53,810
Please, enlighten us.

313
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:56,847
He got a perfect score
on my "cooper test."

314
00:11:56,881 --> 00:11:58,682
Lance drives a mini-cooper,

315
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:00,951
Wants bradley cooper's
blue eyes,

316
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:04,120
And watches anderson cooper
on mute ... 100% gay.

317
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:05,888
That's bananas.

318
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:08,024
Just because a guy enjoys
watching a little olympic diving

319
00:12:08,058 --> 00:12:10,560
Doesn't determine anything
about his sexuality.

320
00:12:10,594 --> 00:12:13,663
You know, I think hanna's onto
something with her cooper test.

321
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:16,366
The league have got
their criteria,

322
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,702
So, why don't we
bring 'em ours?

323
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:20,771
Yeah.

324
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:24,909
It's like I'm caught
in crazy town.

325
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:27,645
Aroyan's got serious
anger-management issues.

326
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,947
Did you see that vein

327
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,082
Throbbing in his forehead
on the video?

328
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:32,750
Right out of "scanners."

329
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,118
I thought
it was gonna explode.

330
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,753
You know it was based
on a true story?

331
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,121
No way.
"scanners." true story.

332
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,524
"ou est la salle de bain?"

333
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,759
"where is the bathroom?"

334
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:43,927
"tu es ma joie de vivre."

335
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:46,696
"you are the joy
of my life."

336
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:48,064
Bon jour.

337
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:49,633
Mon nom est peter

338
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,134
Et c'est jararrd.

339
00:12:51,168 --> 00:12:54,904
What? We both had
mademoiselle stein.

340
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:56,172
I told the warden

341
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:58,441
I'd be happy to answer
any of your questions.

342
00:12:58,476 --> 00:13:00,844
I just can't be late
for my afternoon tai chi class.

343
00:13:00,878 --> 00:13:02,579
Well,
we will be muy rápido.

344
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:04,114
That's spanish,
dick wad.

345
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:06,016
Yeah,
I had señor flackenberry.

346
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,551
Suck it.

347
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:09,619
Julian, we have it
under good authority

348
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:11,655
That you're trying to frame
judge kohler

349
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:12,789
To get your case overturned.

350
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:15,158
Kohler?
Refresh my memory.

351
00:13:15,193 --> 00:13:16,693
Do you remember
your sentencing,

352
00:13:16,727 --> 00:13:18,395
When you said,
and I quote ...

353
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:20,563
"I'm going to shove that gavel
up your butt

354
00:13:20,598 --> 00:13:22,565
So you can't talk out
your ass again"?

355
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:25,134
Well, I was in a dark place
back then spiritually.

356
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:28,104
I've since learned
to channel my anger

357
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:31,474
Into the classics
and meditation, romance lan...

358
00:13:31,508 --> 00:13:33,042
You mean
you turned into a pussy?

359
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:36,146
Only a coward would send
an anonymous letter

360
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,014
To do his dirty work.

361
00:13:39,984 --> 00:13:42,552
This is beneath me.

362
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:43,987
It's not my style.

363
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:46,589
What is your connection
to a night manager

364
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:48,758
At the pasadena grand
named paul ostrowski?

365
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:50,527
It's not ringing any bells,

366
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:53,063
And if you would, I'd like to go
attend my meditation class.

367
00:13:53,097 --> 00:13:54,797
Buddha can wait.

368
00:13:54,832 --> 00:13:57,033
According to
prison phone logs,

369
00:13:57,067 --> 00:14:00,069
You made numerous calls
in April of 2009

370
00:14:00,103 --> 00:14:04,606
To a disposable cell purchased
with cash in pasadena.

371
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:08,109
That ring any bells,
maybe a nicki minaj ring tone?

372
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:10,111
This conversation is over.

373
00:14:10,146 --> 00:14:11,179
Get out of my way.

374
00:14:11,213 --> 00:14:12,814
You know, it's funny.

375
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:15,016
Whenever we call that phone,
it just rings.

376
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,819
Maybe the night manager
doesn't recognize our number.

377
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:20,489
Because he's really
talkative if you call him
on his office line.

378
00:14:20,523 --> 00:14:22,925
Tell you what ... let me get him
on the phone right now,

379
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,960
We'll straighten this whole
thing out with you right here.

380
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:27,063
Whoa!

381
00:14:28,098 --> 00:14:30,166
I'm gonna rip
your throat out!

382
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:31,935
You got it all wrong,
fellas!

383
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:33,736
I just want to serve my time!

384
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,504
It's the guys
about to go away!

385
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:37,807
They're the ones who'll say
anything to stay out! Not me!

386
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:39,074
Whew.

387
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:42,910
It's okay to admit
that he scared you.

388
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:44,779
I'm not scared.

389
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:47,247
You're holding my arm.

390
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:53,687
No, I'm not.

391
00:14:54,849 --> 00:14:54,849
+

392
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,322
Mr. Thorpe, as chairman

393
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,792
Of the gay softball
association of california,

394
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:07,463
You established the criteria
for newly joining members.

395
00:15:07,498 --> 00:15:09,299
I make certain each member

396
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,468
Fulfills the guidelines
of our charter.

397
00:15:11,502 --> 00:15:14,104
And according to
your criteria,

398
00:15:14,138 --> 00:15:18,342
You don't think that lance here
is gay enough?

399
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,378
I don't think
lance is gay at all.

400
00:15:21,412 --> 00:15:24,581
Why? Because he doesn't
act like you?

401
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:27,885
Because he hasn't had
a physical or romantic affair

402
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,653
With a member
of the same sex.

403
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:32,890
Gay isn't a phase
in our league, mr. Infeld.

404
00:15:32,924 --> 00:15:36,661
Are you confident
about your own sexuality?

405
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:38,162
I came out in high school.

406
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:41,598
I've had multiple relationships.
I am a gay man.

407
00:15:41,633 --> 00:15:44,834
Using your criteria,
I suppose.

408
00:15:44,868 --> 00:15:46,702
Nobody could dispute
my pride.

409
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,605
Ah! Now, I'm really happy
to hear you say that,

410
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,242
Because I have my own test
for gayness.

411
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:54,844
Objection, your honor.

412
00:15:54,878 --> 00:15:57,280
Mr. Infeld doesn't have
expert knowledge.

413
00:15:57,315 --> 00:16:00,417
Your honor, this witness
has already testified

414
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:02,586
That nobody will doubt
his pride.

415
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,756
Certainly if he's as gay
as he says he is,

416
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:09,160
Then he'll pass any test
with flying colors.

417
00:16:09,195 --> 00:16:11,529
Overruled.
I'll allow it.

418
00:16:11,564 --> 00:16:13,197
Thank you.

419
00:16:13,232 --> 00:16:14,865
So, mr. Thorpe...

420
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,337
Would you please illuminate
for the court

421
00:16:19,372 --> 00:16:24,142
Who won "dancing with
the stars," season two?

422
00:16:24,176 --> 00:16:27,144
I don't watch
"dancing with the stars."

423
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:28,546
what?! Oh, my.

424
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,548
<i>Oh, well, you should.</i>

425
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:32,716
<i>It's a wonderful show.</i>

426
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,219
By the way, drew lachey.

427
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:38,623
He took the tiara home
that year.

428
00:16:38,657 --> 00:16:40,625
Um
moving on.

429
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:42,828
As a gay man,
you obviously know

430
00:16:42,862 --> 00:16:45,497
Kathy griffin's
current hair color.

431
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:46,732
Red.

432
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:48,468
Ohh. Oh, dear.

433
00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:51,437
no, red
is her natural hair color.

434
00:16:51,472 --> 00:16:54,740
Copper ...
that's the new red.

435
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:55,808
Mm-hmm.

436
00:16:55,843 --> 00:16:58,878
What's gayer ...
pilates or yoga?

437
00:16:58,912 --> 00:17:00,246
Objection!

438
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,115
This ridiculous test
of mr. Infeld's

439
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:03,983
Doesn't prove anything
about sexuality.

440
00:17:04,018 --> 00:17:06,519
It's arbitrary
and demeaning.
Precisely.

441
00:17:06,553 --> 00:17:10,457
My criteria is no less absurd
than mr. Thorpe's.

442
00:17:10,491 --> 00:17:12,692
The only difference is,
your honor,

443
00:17:12,726 --> 00:17:15,829
His criteria
unfairly stripped lance

444
00:17:15,863 --> 00:17:18,565
And the burbank bears
of their title.

445
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:23,470
Well, thank you.
No further questions. Mm.

446
00:17:23,505 --> 00:17:26,273
Pilates is gayer.

447
00:17:31,246 --> 00:17:34,882
Inviting every heterosexual
from your office

448
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,518
Won't protect you
from turning gay, damien.

449
00:17:37,552 --> 00:17:39,386
Oh, please.

450
00:17:39,421 --> 00:17:41,422
I am more than comfortable
with my sexuality.

451
00:17:41,456 --> 00:17:43,557
Besides, my bed count in college
speaks for itself.

452
00:17:43,592 --> 00:17:45,259
Numbers
that can't be verified.

453
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:47,262
Man, everything
is a competition with you.

454
00:17:47,296 --> 00:17:49,831
I'm trying to tell you
I lied about my stats.

455
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:51,332
No way!

456
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:52,867
Every theta pledge
did the walk of shame

457
00:17:52,902 --> 00:17:54,269
Out of your room
junior year.

458
00:17:54,303 --> 00:17:55,436
I saw them come out
in pairs.

459
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:57,171
Oh, I'm a fabulous
listener.

460
00:17:57,205 --> 00:17:58,605
They'd talk about
their eating disorders,

461
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,340
Cheating boyfriends,
waxing.

462
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,109
What about
leslie friedman?

463
00:18:02,143 --> 00:18:04,178
Virgin.
Probably still is.

464
00:18:04,212 --> 00:18:07,481
What? Or chloe summers
and greta turnberry.

465
00:18:07,516 --> 00:18:09,850
Lesbian.
Pregnant, econ professor.

466
00:18:09,885 --> 00:18:11,652
Amanda morris?

467
00:18:11,686 --> 00:18:13,554
It was 20 years ago.

468
00:18:13,588 --> 00:18:16,256
Did you or didn't you
have sex with amanda morris?

469
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:21,261
Amanda isn't the only person
that lance has forgotten about.

470
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:22,762
Did he tell you

471
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:24,664
About his ex-wife?

472
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:26,699
What?

473
00:18:26,734 --> 00:18:29,503
Tanya and I got married
on a cruise to barbados.

474
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:31,605
It lasted three years.

475
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:35,743
And tanya is testifying
against us in the morning.

476
00:18:46,455 --> 00:18:47,655
Hey.

477
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:49,790
Could you
give us a moment?

478
00:18:49,825 --> 00:18:51,925
Look at me.

479
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,695
Stanton gave us matching suits
for making equity partners.

480
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:55,896
We wanted breakaway tuxedos,

481
00:18:55,931 --> 00:18:57,732
But they're not
professional ... here.

482
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:01,569
Listen, peter,

483
00:19:01,603 --> 00:19:03,604
I was thinking
about the conversation

484
00:19:03,638 --> 00:19:05,072
We were having
the other day.

485
00:19:05,107 --> 00:19:06,907
Which conversation
is that?

486
00:19:06,942 --> 00:19:09,843
Oh. Yeah.

487
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:13,413
It might've crossed my mind
a couple hundred times.

488
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:16,350
I mean,
it seems crazy for two people

489
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:19,687
With so much chemistry
to deny something so natural.

490
00:19:19,721 --> 00:19:21,722
You're reading my mind.

491
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:24,392
Two people
working together...

492
00:19:24,426 --> 00:19:26,427
In the trenches.

493
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:29,397
Who would blame them?

494
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:31,666
A jury.

495
00:19:33,168 --> 00:19:34,735
This is about
kohler and pollock?!

496
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,172
Judgment can be compromised
when desire interferes.

497
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:39,541
that was cruel.

498
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:40,642
But effective.

499
00:19:40,676 --> 00:19:42,210
We're willing to reduce
the charge

500
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:43,879
To one count
of misdemeanor conduct

501
00:19:43,913 --> 00:19:45,848
And he steps down
from the bench for good.

502
00:19:45,882 --> 00:19:47,883
He'll never go for it. And
d.A. Pollock isn't exactly ...

503
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:49,585
She's a victim.

504
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:52,588
She heads up our
conviction integrity program.

505
00:19:52,622 --> 00:19:55,457
She started the prisoner
rehabilitation program.

506
00:19:55,492 --> 00:19:58,428
She runs the unsolved
crimes division. She's a saint.

507
00:19:58,462 --> 00:20:01,264
She helps inmates...
Graduate high school.

508
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:02,598
Assface!

509
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:04,501
Hey!
grandma janie!

510
00:20:04,535 --> 00:20:06,602
Assface.
Hi.

511
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:08,838
Sorry. You have to go. We have
high-level legal defense stuff.

512
00:20:08,872 --> 00:20:11,407
Yeah, we're gonna talk
about you. Get out of here.

513
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:13,709
I'm gone. Get your boyfriend
to take the deal.

514
00:20:13,743 --> 00:20:15,611
Did you show her
our suits?

515
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:17,179
Yeah.
We got suits!

516
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:18,847
Hey, we got to get carmen
on d.A. Pollock.

517
00:20:18,881 --> 00:20:20,415
She's either
being blackmailed,

518
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:21,616
She's being unfaithful,

519
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:23,218
Or she's telling the truth.

520
00:20:23,252 --> 00:20:24,786
Huh?
Huh?

521
00:20:24,821 --> 00:20:26,154
What?

522
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,225
We shopped together,
danced.

523
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:31,526
He was fun.

524
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:32,894
And if he was so wonderful,

525
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:34,596
Why aren't you
still together?

526
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,230
I opened a hair salon.

527
00:20:36,265 --> 00:20:37,866
Lance started
a fitness club.

528
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,635
The stress put too much pressure
on our relationship.

529
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:42,236
It tore us apart.

530
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:44,439
Like so many other
straight marriages?

531
00:20:44,473 --> 00:20:45,707
Mm-hmm.

532
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:48,042
No further questions.

533
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:54,349
Could you read aloud
the charge

534
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:56,384
Highlighted
on the credit-card statement

535
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:57,819
You shared
with your ex-husband?

536
00:20:57,853 --> 00:21:00,822
$14.95, monthly service
installment for...

537
00:21:00,856 --> 00:21:02,724
Guycatch.Com.

538
00:21:02,758 --> 00:21:05,293
A gay dating website
for men.

539
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:07,595
A charge which appears
every month for six months

540
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,364
Before your divorce.

541
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:11,466
Lance joined the site
to help a gay friend

542
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,201
At the salon start dating.
Yeah, right.

543
00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:14,936
And I go to strip clubs
'cause I love buffalo wings.

544
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,270
Objection.

545
00:21:16,305 --> 00:21:17,472
Mr. Karp's perverse diet

546
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:19,507
Has no relevance
in these proceedings.

547
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:22,844
Ms. Renner, you didn't step
forward to testify against lance

548
00:21:22,878 --> 00:21:24,446
Because you think
he's lying.

549
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,248
You did it
because you're angry.

550
00:21:26,282 --> 00:21:28,917
You're angry that your dancing
and shopping partner

551
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:31,185
Could never be in love
with a woman.

552
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,621
You feel used,
don't you?

553
00:21:33,656 --> 00:21:35,123
Lied to?

554
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:41,029
And who could blame you?

555
00:21:43,765 --> 00:21:46,100
No further questions.

556
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:50,004
Redirect, your honor.

557
00:21:50,939 --> 00:21:52,907
About how many times
per week

558
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:55,576
Did you and lance engage
in sexual relations?

559
00:21:55,611 --> 00:21:57,211
Objection. Relevance.

560
00:21:57,246 --> 00:21:58,613
Well, mr. Karp
made it relevant

561
00:21:58,647 --> 00:22:00,214
By suggesting
this was a sham marriage.

562
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:01,783
Objection overruled.

563
00:22:01,817 --> 00:22:03,451
The witness can answer.

564
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:05,520
Three to four.

565
00:22:05,554 --> 00:22:07,823
And did lance
ever experience any ...

566
00:22:07,857 --> 00:22:09,691
Forgive me ...
stage fright?

567
00:22:09,726 --> 00:22:12,427
Quite the opposite.

568
00:22:12,462 --> 00:22:13,595
Oh.

569
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:16,332
Three-year marriage,
active sex life.

570
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:18,367
Well, if lance
isn't straight,

571
00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:21,237
Then he deserves
an academy award.

572
00:22:21,271 --> 00:22:22,972
Thank you.

573
00:22:26,663 --> 00:22:26,663
+

574
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:31,242
I've been a trial judge
for 19 years,

575
00:22:31,276 --> 00:22:33,310
Presiding over
1,470 cases.

576
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:37,014
And of those 1,400-plus cases,
how many were appealed?

577
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:38,716
Roughly half.
Comes with the job.

578
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,818
How many were overturned?

579
00:22:40,852 --> 00:22:42,052
Two.

580
00:22:42,087 --> 00:22:44,888
Two out of 700 cases,

581
00:22:44,923 --> 00:22:46,390
Meaning your interpretation
of the law

582
00:22:46,424 --> 00:22:47,991
Is nearly incontrovertible.

583
00:22:48,026 --> 00:22:50,895
As judges,
we must put prejudice aside

584
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:53,097
And see cases through
the blindfolded eyes

585
00:22:53,131 --> 00:22:54,298
Of lady justice.

586
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:57,802
Lady justice.
I like that.

587
00:22:57,836 --> 00:22:59,737
Now, we've demonstrated
that you're a man of honesty,

588
00:22:59,772 --> 00:23:01,172
A man of integrity.

589
00:23:01,206 --> 00:23:02,740
Would you tell the jury

590
00:23:02,774 --> 00:23:04,809
When you began your relationship
with d.A. Pollock?

591
00:23:04,843 --> 00:23:06,577
In February of 2010.

592
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:09,780
I immediately recused myself
from all her future cases.

593
00:23:09,815 --> 00:23:12,016
February 2010,

594
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:15,353
More than a year after the claim
in the anonymous letter.

595
00:23:16,822 --> 00:23:18,422
No more questions.

596
00:23:23,128 --> 00:23:26,163
Respectfully,
judge kohler,

597
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:27,732
What signified
February of 2010

598
00:23:27,766 --> 00:23:29,267
As the start
of your relationship?

599
00:23:29,301 --> 00:23:32,170
A sexual encounter
late one evening in my chambers.

600
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:34,739
Crossing the line
from colleague

601
00:23:34,773 --> 00:23:36,574
To something more
takes courage.

602
00:23:36,608 --> 00:23:38,809
I-I-if you're not both
on the same page

603
00:23:38,844 --> 00:23:40,011
When that spark strikes,

604
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:43,114
Things could get
real awkward.

605
00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:45,583
Objection.
Counsel's testifying.

606
00:23:45,618 --> 00:23:49,188
Ms. Ross is trying to work out
certain issues in her own life.

607
00:23:49,222 --> 00:23:51,690
Your point, ms. Ross?

608
00:23:51,724 --> 00:23:54,026
The emotional buildup
to a relationship

609
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,694
Is just as significant

610
00:23:55,729 --> 00:23:59,231
As the consummation of the
relationship itself, your honor.

611
00:23:59,265 --> 00:24:00,966
Carry on.

612
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,836
So, is the jury to believe

613
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:07,039
That you didn't experience
any feelings toward d.A. Pollock

614
00:24:07,074 --> 00:24:09,976
Prior to that intimate encounter
in your chambers?

615
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,845
I am a professional,
ms. Ross.

616
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:15,147
Uh, let me rephrase
the question.

617
00:24:15,182 --> 00:24:19,852
Was it professional
to send ms. Pollock an e-mail

618
00:24:19,887 --> 00:24:23,222
In March of 2009
with a winky face emoticon?

619
00:24:23,256 --> 00:24:25,591
I am known
for my emoticons,

620
00:24:25,626 --> 00:24:27,092
Especially
the abe lincoln face.

621
00:24:27,127 --> 00:24:29,561
I've sent them to all the d.A.S
in your office,

622
00:24:29,596 --> 00:24:30,963
Defense attorneys,
my support staff ...

623
00:24:30,998 --> 00:24:32,198
Can you answer
the question?

624
00:24:32,232 --> 00:24:34,400
Keeping in mind
you're under oath.

625
00:24:36,002 --> 00:24:38,738
I may have been attracted
to margaret.

626
00:24:38,772 --> 00:24:40,873
I swear, it had no impact
on my rulings.

627
00:24:40,907 --> 00:24:43,008
Are you absolutely sure?

628
00:24:43,043 --> 00:24:46,345
Couldn't your attraction have
colored things...Just a little?

629
00:24:46,379 --> 00:24:48,847
I don't know.

630
00:24:48,882 --> 00:24:50,849
Thank you
for your honesty.

631
00:24:50,884 --> 00:24:53,819
No further questions.

632
00:25:02,128 --> 00:25:03,629
Hey, hey.

633
00:25:03,663 --> 00:25:04,930
Hey. Carmen.

634
00:25:04,965 --> 00:25:06,933
Hey. So, I ran into
an old friend

635
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:09,768
While researching pollock's
prisoner rehabilitation program.

636
00:25:09,803 --> 00:25:11,069
Guys, this is ricky.

637
00:25:11,104 --> 00:25:12,271
Ricky.
Hey, ricky.

638
00:25:12,305 --> 00:25:13,672
Get the guys up to speed

639
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:14,840
With what you told me.

640
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:17,309
From January 2009
to April 2009,

641
00:25:17,344 --> 00:25:19,912
Larry dobeck did a stretch
for identity theft.

642
00:25:19,946 --> 00:25:21,814
He's the cousin
of the night manager

643
00:25:21,848 --> 00:25:22,915
At the pasadena grand,

644
00:25:22,949 --> 00:25:24,683
Where pollock and kohler
were I.D.'d.

645
00:25:24,717 --> 00:25:27,252
Served his time in the same
cell block as julian aroyan.

646
00:25:27,286 --> 00:25:29,020
Which is probably
where pollock enters our story,

647
00:25:29,054 --> 00:25:30,255
Except I can't find aroyan

648
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:31,756
In any of the classes
pollock taught.

649
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:33,024
But here's the thing ...

650
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:34,926
Pollock tutors him privately
in french.

651
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:37,162
Privately, as in alone?

652
00:25:37,197 --> 00:25:39,097
As in very committed
to his studies?

653
00:25:39,132 --> 00:25:41,033
Fluent in
the romantic languages?

654
00:25:41,067 --> 00:25:42,334
Okay, enough.

655
00:25:42,368 --> 00:25:43,802
Is he boning her or what?

656
00:25:45,138 --> 00:25:46,738
Look, you didn't hear this
from me, all right?

657
00:25:46,773 --> 00:25:48,040
But she got a class
at 2:00 p.M.

658
00:25:48,074 --> 00:25:49,308
Ask her yourself.

659
00:25:49,342 --> 00:25:50,977
Thanks, ricky.

660
00:25:51,011 --> 00:25:52,778
You got it.

661
00:25:52,813 --> 00:25:54,948
<i>I am done getting
sucker-punched by you.</i>

662
00:25:54,982 --> 00:25:56,216
What's really going on?

663
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,018
Oh, you figured me out,
damien.

664
00:25:58,052 --> 00:25:59,820
I'm faking gay
for an aluminum trophy.

665
00:25:59,854 --> 00:26:01,955
Well, you know,
from where I'm standing,

666
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,091
I see the exact same guy
who threw spitters in college

667
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:05,592
To get
his strikeout records.

668
00:26:05,627 --> 00:26:07,495
Yeah, so what?
I like to win.

669
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:09,697
Yeah, well,
that's the exact same attitude

670
00:26:09,731 --> 00:26:11,932
That landed me in the hospital
with a broken nose

671
00:26:11,967 --> 00:26:13,534
And...Got you
amanda morris.

672
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:15,904
Oh, come on!
I didn't mean to mess us up.

673
00:26:15,938 --> 00:26:17,038
We were like brothers.

674
00:26:17,072 --> 00:26:18,873
Well, now I'm your lawyer.

675
00:26:18,907 --> 00:26:20,942
And unless we can find someone
to corroborate your sexuality,

676
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:23,811
Preferably not some
hot bikini model...

677
00:26:23,846 --> 00:26:25,680
We're screwed.

678
00:26:25,715 --> 00:26:28,183
I don't have to
listen to this.

679
00:26:28,217 --> 00:26:29,918
I'll tell ya.

680
00:26:29,952 --> 00:26:32,620
One time, I tried telling
somebody who was close to me,

681
00:26:32,655 --> 00:26:33,855
But I lacked the courage

682
00:26:33,889 --> 00:26:35,957
'cause I thought
it would change everything.

683
00:26:35,991 --> 00:26:39,293
Awesome.
We'll go with that.

684
00:26:39,328 --> 00:26:41,762
So much confidence now.

685
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,200
Oh, great timing.

686
00:26:45,234 --> 00:26:47,335
I-I think we're gonna use
your cooper test results

687
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,770
To sway the judge.

688
00:26:48,804 --> 00:26:50,672
"love is blind.

689
00:26:50,706 --> 00:26:52,774
Friendship closes its eyes."

690
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:54,843
Really?
I can usually count on stanton

691
00:26:54,877 --> 00:26:56,745
For the useless
nietzsche quotes.

692
00:26:57,746 --> 00:26:59,681
What am I gonna do
about lance?

693
00:26:59,715 --> 00:27:02,551
Do you remember
when you took me to catalina

694
00:27:02,585 --> 00:27:04,085
For valentine's day?

695
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,289
You left early because
I spent the entire vacation

696
00:27:07,323 --> 00:27:10,592
Playing golf with tom wuhler
from the new york office.

697
00:27:10,627 --> 00:27:14,630
I left early because you filled
our hotel room with orchids

698
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:16,232
And I broke out in hives.

699
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:18,167
What?
How was I supposed to know?

700
00:27:18,202 --> 00:27:20,236
You used to leave orchids
on my desk

701
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:21,838
Every time
you thought about me.

702
00:27:21,872 --> 00:27:24,207
And every time,
I told you they were sweet,

703
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,676
But I'm not really
a flower girl.

704
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,945
Mm.
All women love flowers.

705
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,249
I-I just figured that you
wanted me to work harder.

706
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:35,152
Sometimes you listen
to the words, damien,

707
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:36,520
But you don't hear them.

708
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,122
Your problem
isn't about lance.

709
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:42,125
<i>It's about you.</i>

710
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,798
Wow.

711
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,967
You think you could
break out of this prison?

712
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,270
Unmarked bulletproof helicopter
lands in the yard.

713
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,305
Cayenne pepper
to throw off the dogs.

714
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,807
Gone in 60 seconds!

715
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,609
You have
thought this through.

716
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:01,078
But where are you getting an
unmarked bulletproof helicopter?

717
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,646
<i>That's where you come in.</i>

718
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,181
Here we go.

719
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:06,183
Peter, jared.
Is everything okay with derek?

720
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,153
Sorry, I bet him five bucks
that you'd confess

721
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,989
To your affair with aroyan
the second you saw us.

722
00:28:13,023 --> 00:28:14,624
That's ridiculous.

723
00:28:14,658 --> 00:28:15,991
That's what I said!

724
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:17,927
A woman who could crush
her fiancé's heart

725
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:19,628
With her bare hands
isn't capable of remorse.

726
00:28:19,663 --> 00:28:21,197
That's what he said.

727
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:23,165
Just because I work
independently with a prisoner

728
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,000
Doesn't mean I'm romantically
involved with him.

729
00:28:25,035 --> 00:28:26,802
Oh!

730
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:28,637
Please stop doing that.

731
00:28:28,671 --> 00:28:30,705
We can't let you
send kohler to prison

732
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,674
Just so you can continue
your french-fests.

733
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:34,709
I moved in with derek.

734
00:28:34,744 --> 00:28:37,679
I became a dog person for him.
We're engaged.

735
00:28:37,714 --> 00:28:40,616
That's probably gonna change
when you're locked up in chino

736
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,017
For conspiracy
and criminal fraud.

737
00:28:42,051 --> 00:28:43,885
I'd imagine
it's not co-ed,

738
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,821
So you're gonna have to bid
adieu to your french lessons.

739
00:28:45,855 --> 00:28:48,891
Derek's gonna be upset
when he hears about this.

740
00:28:50,627 --> 00:28:52,528
You used to live
in pasadena

741
00:28:52,562 --> 00:28:54,563
Before you moved in
with kohler, right?

742
00:28:54,598 --> 00:28:56,165
That's the same city
where aroyan

743
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:58,300
Bought the disposable cellphone
he's been calling.

744
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:07,640
+

745
00:29:09,176 --> 00:29:13,874
- How you think Nickol will take the news about pollock?
- You've ever seen your father crying?

746
00:29:13,908 --> 00:29:16,143
Oh, man. I feel sorry
for the grumpy dude.

747
00:29:16,177 --> 00:29:18,345
Up until now, I didn't know
his heart was capable of a beat.

748
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,980
Same old story.

749
00:29:20,015 --> 00:29:22,383
Innocent hot girl falls
for dangerous bad boy.

750
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:23,784
This is so "dirty dancing."

751
00:29:23,818 --> 00:29:25,285
Aah!

752
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,021
Yeah, except swayze
was just misunderstood.

753
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:31,091
there he is!

754
00:29:31,126 --> 00:29:34,161
There! There...He is!

755
00:29:35,964 --> 00:29:37,198
Come on in!

756
00:29:37,232 --> 00:29:39,734
What is it
that couldn't wait?

757
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:42,804
I have to meet margaret
for our marriage blood test.

758
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:44,339
Okay, um...

759
00:29:44,373 --> 00:29:47,008
Jared has some information
that he has to share with you.

760
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:48,609
Me?
J's before "p."

761
00:29:48,644 --> 00:29:51,812
All right.
Uh, your honor,

762
00:29:51,847 --> 00:29:55,750
Are you aware that your fiancée
had personal...

763
00:29:55,784 --> 00:29:58,386
Encounters with prisoners?

764
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,188
Her rehabilitation program
has an 80% graduation rate,

765
00:30:01,223 --> 00:30:03,624
So I assumed
that she's had favorites.

766
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:05,126
She does.
She does.

767
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,327
Yeah.

768
00:30:06,362 --> 00:30:08,296
Julian aroyan
is one of them.

769
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,264
For the last three years,

770
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:13,601
Your fiancée privately
tutored him in french.

771
00:30:15,704 --> 00:30:19,073
She was also
teaching me french.

772
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:22,143
A prison guard
confirmed it,

773
00:30:22,178 --> 00:30:23,945
But he won't testify.

774
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:28,884
So your theory is based
on an unverifiable witness.

775
00:30:28,918 --> 00:30:32,755
Well, we kind of hoped maybe
you had access to her computer

776
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,823
Or had come across
any suspicious documents.

777
00:30:34,858 --> 00:30:36,258
She covered her tracks.

778
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,394
I am telling you
that you are wrong.

779
00:30:38,428 --> 00:30:40,229
She gave up her home.
She gave away her cat.

780
00:30:40,263 --> 00:30:42,064
<i>She became a dog person.</i>

781
00:30:42,098 --> 00:30:46,269
Sh... we've merged our finances.
She's planning a life with me.

782
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:47,937
Or she's planning
her escape

783
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,238
And doesn't want
any attachments.

784
00:30:49,273 --> 00:30:52,775
You're wrong!
And you're lazy!

785
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,845
And if you can't find the person
that's setting me up,

786
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,381
Then I will have to find someone
that will.

787
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,021
<i>Maybe you should have
gone first.</i>

788
00:31:05,056 --> 00:31:07,858
No, you did ...
you did...Good.

789
00:31:07,892 --> 00:31:09,126
I don't think so.

790
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:10,561
No.

791
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:17,102
<i>You really don't have a life,
do you?</i>

792
00:31:17,137 --> 00:31:19,205
What can I do
for you, peter?

793
00:31:20,273 --> 00:31:23,309
Pollock rigged the case.
You have to dismiss.

794
00:31:23,343 --> 00:31:24,343
Do I?

795
00:31:24,378 --> 00:31:25,878
This is about
a woman's control,

796
00:31:25,913 --> 00:31:27,113
Not a judge's
dereliction of duty.

797
00:31:27,147 --> 00:31:28,948
A woman's control?

798
00:31:28,983 --> 00:31:32,686
No, this is about how kohler
lured her in

799
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,789
With his power and his charm
and his eyes.

800
00:31:35,823 --> 00:31:38,058
<i>She lured him in
with her siren song.</i>

801
00:31:38,092 --> 00:31:40,426
You've read
"the odyssey"?

802
00:31:40,461 --> 00:31:41,994
Cliffs notes.

803
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:46,899
Even with his boat shattered
in pieces,

804
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:49,368
He still clings to the rocks,

805
00:31:49,402 --> 00:31:52,237
Waiting...Hoping...

806
00:31:52,271 --> 00:31:56,241
For one last glimpse...

807
00:31:56,275 --> 00:31:58,509
Of her beauty.

808
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:02,814
♪ won't you move
a little closer ♪

809
00:32:02,848 --> 00:32:06,350

♪ oooohhhhh ♪

813
00:32:25,303 --> 00:32:27,304
Mr. Dillon...

814
00:32:27,338 --> 00:32:30,774
You know, you're not
the first man to marry a woman

815
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:32,209
To hide his homosexuality.

816
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:35,279
You know,
but what really baffles me is...

817
00:32:35,313 --> 00:32:39,416
Why did you stay in the closet
for so long?

818
00:32:39,451 --> 00:32:41,318
I, um...

819
00:32:41,353 --> 00:32:45,690
Couldn't handle the consequences
of coming out.

820
00:32:45,724 --> 00:32:48,325
Oh. The consequences.

821
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,963
<i>So, what happened when you first
tried to come out?</i>

822
00:32:51,997 --> 00:32:53,297
I, uh...

823
00:32:53,332 --> 00:32:57,168
Well, actually, um...
Uh, there...

824
00:32:57,202 --> 00:32:59,103
Now, take your time.

825
00:32:59,137 --> 00:33:03,107
Your honor,
with the court's permission,

826
00:33:03,142 --> 00:33:05,009
I'll continue the line
of questioning.

827
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:14,651
Isn't it true that you once
got into a fight

828
00:33:14,686 --> 00:33:17,287
With your best friend
over a girl?

829
00:33:17,321 --> 00:33:19,956
Amanda morris.

830
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,058
Right, and you boiled over
with so much rage

831
00:33:22,092 --> 00:33:24,260
That, in a fit of passion,
you punched him.

832
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,895
Yeah, as hard as I could.

833
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:27,697
Right.

834
00:33:27,731 --> 00:33:31,835
But the rage wasn't over
amanda morris, was it?

835
00:33:31,869 --> 00:33:33,937
Was it?

836
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:36,273
Actually,
it involved someone

837
00:33:36,307 --> 00:33:39,009
Who wouldn't have understood
the truth.

838
00:33:39,043 --> 00:33:40,677
Who was that person?

839
00:33:40,711 --> 00:33:43,714
I don't want to do this
right now.

840
00:33:43,748 --> 00:33:46,817
I get it, but, unfortunately,
you're under oath.

841
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:50,121
Answer the question.

842
00:33:54,393 --> 00:33:57,595
You.

843
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,397
I punched you

844
00:33:59,431 --> 00:34:02,967
Because I was...Angry...

845
00:34:03,002 --> 00:34:05,203
That I'd never have you.

846
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,881
Thank you, lance.
Thank you.

847
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:25,758
We subpoena aroyan
and the night manager.

848
00:34:25,792 --> 00:34:27,860
They'll just lie.

849
00:34:27,894 --> 00:34:29,795
We can...

850
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:31,230
We ...

851
00:34:31,264 --> 00:34:32,831
Okay, could you stop
with the guitar?

852
00:34:32,866 --> 00:34:34,566
You're killing me.

853
00:34:36,736 --> 00:34:38,370
You slept with janie.

854
00:34:38,404 --> 00:34:40,005
What are you
talking about?

855
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:41,807
You know
what I'm talking about.

856
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:43,208
That is the same cheesy song
you wrote

857
00:34:43,243 --> 00:34:44,977
The first time you guys
slept together!

858
00:34:45,011 --> 00:34:46,879
It's not cheesy.
That is a cheesy song!

859
00:34:46,913 --> 00:34:48,247
It's "rainy day janie"!
That is warped. What?!

860
00:34:48,281 --> 00:34:49,948
"rainy day janie."

861
00:34:49,983 --> 00:34:51,316
"rainy day janie."
how dare you?

862
00:34:51,351 --> 00:34:54,152
<i>How dare you?</i>

863
00:34:54,187 --> 00:34:55,687
That is a gutsy move,

864
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:57,555
Considering we are
representing a judge

865
00:34:57,589 --> 00:34:58,922
Who's accused
of the same crime?

866
00:34:58,957 --> 00:35:01,658
It's different.
How?

867
00:35:01,692 --> 00:35:03,193
It's way, way different!

868
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:05,328
<i>How?!
It's not different.</i>

869
00:35:05,362 --> 00:35:06,829
Ew. You ...

870
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:10,332
All rise.

871
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:12,768
I just picked up
my blood-test results

872
00:35:12,803 --> 00:35:14,904
From my doctor, and he gave me
margaret's work-up.

873
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:16,839
She's running away
with aroyan,

874
00:35:16,873 --> 00:35:18,908
As soon as she
gets me convicted.

875
00:35:18,943 --> 00:35:21,911
Which will give him the key
to his prison cell.

876
00:35:23,881 --> 00:35:25,215
Man, according to this,

877
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:27,150
She's had her exit plan
from the start.

878
00:35:27,184 --> 00:35:29,252
This isn't enough
to prove she set him up.

879
00:35:29,286 --> 00:35:30,654
We got to find something

880
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,188
To directly link her plan
to aroyan.

881
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:36,259
I've seen franklin and bash
do a lot more with a lot less.

882
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:38,928
+

883
00:35:41,824 --> 00:35:44,559
The defense calls
margaret pollock to the stand.

884
00:35:53,168 --> 00:35:54,903
Objection!

885
00:35:54,937 --> 00:35:56,404
This witness
is not on my list.

886
00:35:56,439 --> 00:35:58,206
Clearly, ms. Ross woke up

887
00:35:58,241 --> 00:36:00,842
On the side of the wrong bed
this morning.

888
00:36:00,877 --> 00:36:02,510
We've brought in
julian aroyan

889
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:04,312
Strictly for
identification purposes.

890
00:36:04,347 --> 00:36:05,414
Overruled.

891
00:36:05,448 --> 00:36:07,482
Overruled.

892
00:36:07,517 --> 00:36:09,784
Miss pollock,
do you recognize the man

893
00:36:09,818 --> 00:36:12,387
Sitting in the front row
between the two officers?

894
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:14,489
Mr. Aroyan
is a student of mine

895
00:36:14,524 --> 00:36:16,325
At the california
correctional institute.

896
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:18,393
Are you in love with him?

897
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:19,929
Absolutely not.

898
00:36:19,963 --> 00:36:22,031
Return to port, mr. Franklin.

899
00:36:22,065 --> 00:36:23,432
Your fishing expedition
is over.

900
00:36:25,035 --> 00:36:27,170
I apologize
for my colleague.

901
00:36:27,204 --> 00:36:29,439
<i>Of course you're not in love
with someone like that.</i>

902
00:36:29,473 --> 00:36:32,309
You're engaged
to judge kohler.

903
00:36:32,343 --> 00:36:33,510
This woman...

904
00:36:33,544 --> 00:36:35,245
She got
a marriage blood test,

905
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:37,314
Something the state of
california doesn't even require.

906
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:38,315
Why?

907
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,251
They're needed in France.

908
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:42,487
We're planning a ceremony
in brantÃ´me.

909
00:36:42,521 --> 00:36:44,223
It's the venice
of périgord.

910
00:36:44,257 --> 00:36:47,192
That's beautiful.

911
00:36:47,227 --> 00:36:48,994
But you also got vaccinations
for typhoid,

912
00:36:49,028 --> 00:36:51,530
Malaria, and diphtheria
at the same doctor's visit.

913
00:36:51,564 --> 00:36:54,900
I...Wanted to be caught up
in case we traveled.

914
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:57,102
Well, I wasn't aware of
a malaria epidemic in France.

915
00:36:57,136 --> 00:36:58,403
Objection!
Argumentative.

916
00:36:58,438 --> 00:36:59,938
Sustained.

917
00:36:59,972 --> 00:37:01,941
Miss pollock,
were you aware

918
00:37:01,975 --> 00:37:05,178
That vaccinations
for schistosomiasis

919
00:37:05,212 --> 00:37:07,013
And mediterranean spotted fever

920
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:10,016
Are only required for
remote regions of morocco?

921
00:37:10,051 --> 00:37:11,218
I'm not a physician.

922
00:37:11,252 --> 00:37:12,986
Relevance, your honor.

923
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:14,455
Mr. Bash,
your clock is ticking.

924
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:17,258
What if I told you that
the contents of this envelope

925
00:37:17,292 --> 00:37:19,460
Contained two plane tickets
to rabat, morocco?

926
00:37:21,163 --> 00:37:23,131
I would say it's a patented
franklin-and-bash bluff.

927
00:37:23,165 --> 00:37:26,101
Could you please read
the contents aloud for the jury?

928
00:37:33,174 --> 00:37:36,343
Two tickets
to rabat, morocco.

929
00:37:36,377 --> 00:37:37,577
Who are they for?

930
00:37:37,612 --> 00:37:40,347
Me and...

931
00:37:40,381 --> 00:37:42,114
Derek kohler.

932
00:37:42,149 --> 00:37:45,117
You bitch! You set me up!
You're going with him?!

933
00:37:45,152 --> 00:37:47,019
Babe, I'm not going
with h...

934
00:37:47,054 --> 00:37:48,387
You're a liar!

935
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:50,089
Bailiffs, remove him!

936
00:37:51,558 --> 00:37:53,292
I ...

937
00:37:53,327 --> 00:37:55,961
I mean...

938
00:37:55,996 --> 00:37:58,197
These tickets are fake.

939
00:37:58,231 --> 00:38:01,000
Miss pollock,
you sent the anonymous package

940
00:38:01,034 --> 00:38:02,935
Implicating judge kohler
to your own office, didn't you?

941
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,136
Prove that.

942
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:05,505
A-at this time,

943
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:07,974
The prosecution moves
to dismiss, your honor.

944
00:38:08,008 --> 00:38:11,845
And we would also move
to add the charge of perjury

945
00:38:11,879 --> 00:38:13,446
Against margaret pollock.

946
00:38:13,481 --> 00:38:15,282
Bailiffs,

947
00:38:15,316 --> 00:38:17,717
Take miss pollock into custody,
forthwith.

948
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:32,232
Really?

949
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:33,333
Uh-huh.

950
00:38:33,368 --> 00:38:34,568
All right.

951
00:38:39,975 --> 00:38:43,511
Janie, d.A. Pollock's
a bad person.

952
00:38:43,545 --> 00:38:45,479
She used judge kohler's
vulnerability

953
00:38:45,514 --> 00:38:47,415
<i>To manipulate everyone
around her.</i>

954
00:38:47,449 --> 00:38:49,216
Is that what we're doing
to each other?

955
00:38:49,251 --> 00:38:51,819
We're just having fun.

956
00:38:51,853 --> 00:38:56,157
Our sex-tivities were never
this adventurous when we dated.

957
00:38:56,191 --> 00:38:57,325
Sex-tivities.

958
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,826
At least we don't have
the pressure

959
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,294
Of a relationship
hanging over us.

960
00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:02,563
Nope, just the fantasy.

961
00:39:02,597 --> 00:39:04,298
And if we got caught...

962
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:05,900
Caught doing what?

963
00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:07,468
Yeah, what?

964
00:39:07,503 --> 00:39:09,838
Uh, caught with our pants down
over d.A. Pollock.

965
00:39:09,872 --> 00:39:12,607
A fair judgment means you check
your emotions at the door.

966
00:39:23,018 --> 00:39:27,521
On behalf of the gay softball
association of california,

967
00:39:27,556 --> 00:39:31,091
Join me in congratulating
the burbank bears

968
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,926
As our new champions!

969
00:39:35,463 --> 00:39:38,064
awesome.

970
00:39:46,607 --> 00:39:48,142
Hey!

971
00:39:48,176 --> 00:39:50,111
Hey.
oh, right.

972
00:39:50,145 --> 00:39:51,479
Well, looks like
this rainbow

973
00:39:51,513 --> 00:39:54,382
Had a pot of gold at the end
of it after all.

974
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:56,150
Listen, damien,
I never said so.

975
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,986
I want you to know I'm sorry
I decked you back then.

976
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,388
I wish I just, somehow,
I could have spared you,

977
00:40:00,423 --> 00:40:03,057
I don't know, some of
those years of self-doubt ...

978
00:40:03,092 --> 00:40:04,392
Without the sex,
obviously.

979
00:40:04,426 --> 00:40:06,027
It was a crush,
all right?

980
00:40:06,061 --> 00:40:07,562
You're not even my type
these days.

981
00:40:07,596 --> 00:40:08,930
What's your type?

982
00:40:08,964 --> 00:40:10,565
Men who are in shape.
I'm in shape!

983
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:12,834
Are you kidding me?
I haven't had a carb
in like nine years.

984
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,469
Look, I would never
jeopardize our friendship

985
00:40:14,504 --> 00:40:16,004
By hitting on you.

986
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:18,039
Well, that's great,
but, I mean, seriously.

987
00:40:18,074 --> 00:40:19,574
What area do you think
needs the most work?

988
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:21,043
It's hard to get this flat,

989
00:40:21,077 --> 00:40:22,478
Because I have
large internal organs.

990
00:40:22,512 --> 00:40:23,645
Yeah. Yeah.

991
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,049
Hey, all right!

992
00:40:30,687 --> 00:40:32,987
You hear about
this guy knuckleface?

993
00:40:33,022 --> 00:40:35,390
You got to admit,
that is one badass mob name.

994
00:40:35,424 --> 00:40:37,792
That's what
I've been sayin' forever.

995
00:40:37,826 --> 00:40:39,526
<i>I mean, we should have
mob names.</i>

996
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:41,928
I'll go by "jelly roll."

997
00:40:41,962 --> 00:40:44,130
I'm not
calling you jelly roll.

998
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:45,632
That's stupid.

999
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:48,936
You got a beef
with jelly roll, juice box?

1000
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,237
Juice box? I'm juice box?
Uh-huh.

1001
00:40:50,272 --> 00:40:52,807
Scary guy
fortified with vitamin c?

1002
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:55,243
Nobody knows
what it really means.

1003
00:40:55,277 --> 00:40:57,345
All rise.

1004
00:41:00,616 --> 00:41:02,417
Hey ...
whoa.

1005
00:41:02,451 --> 00:41:04,853
Your honor, you can't
preside over this case,
given our history.

1006
00:41:04,887 --> 00:41:06,454
You're supposed to
recuse yourself.

1007
00:41:06,488 --> 00:41:09,157
Gentlemen, that is my choice,
not the law.

1008
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:10,458
Unless, of course,

1009
00:41:10,493 --> 00:41:12,327
You filed a 997 affidavit
to have me removed.

1010
00:41:12,361 --> 00:41:14,062
And had you pursued that route,

1011
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,897
I would have issued a writ
of prohibition to stop it.

1012
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,765
That's not cool.
This sucks!

1013
00:41:20,235 --> 00:41:23,037
Don't tempt me, fellas.

1014
00:41:23,072 --> 00:41:26,108
We have histor...
ahh, come on. Ahhh! Ahh.

1015
00:41:26,142 --> 00:41:28,143
I think you should stop.
Really?

1016
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:41,672
