- To me?

Well, I liked her.

But if you killed her,
I'm sure you had a reason.

(OFFICERS TALKING IN DISTINCTLY)

205
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,642
He only smashed symbols
of her relationship with this new chap,

206
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,690
which makes for a very intimate scene.

207
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,089
And we know that
he smashes things when he's angry.

208
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,085
All of which tends
to align us in Luther's direction.

209
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,284
Unless this was staged for our benefit.

210
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,600

212
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,405
It's worth considering, surely.

213
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,164
Well, even if he didn't have an alibi,

214
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,006
when a man stages a murder scene,
he tends to make it look like

215
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,085
how he thinks it should.

216
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,647
It's always wrong.

217
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,248
But this scene is
consistent with the thesis.

218
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,360
And to stage such a scene correctly

219
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,489
would require a very chilly heart.

220
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,724
Which doesn't seem
compatible with a crime of rage.

221
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,966

This kind of killing, jealous husband,
sex, rage and all the rest of it.

You'd expect a knife, a bludgeon
of some kind. A fist. Not a gun.

You don't like the choice of weapon,
so that makes Luther innocent?

I want him to be innocent.

properly and without hesitation.

arguing that
positive self-deception is a normal

239

and advantageous part
of most people's lives.

It turns out, people lie to
themselves about three things.

241

They view themselves
in implausibly positive ways,

242

they think they have
far more control over their lives

243
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,926
than they actually do,

244
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,083
and they believe the future will be

245
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,051

he left it for a reason.

It's a weakness. He'll use it.

527
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,283
- I can control it.
- Well, you'd better.

528
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,050
'Cause if I understand correctly, police
marksmen don't shoot to wound.

529
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,485
No. They shoot to stop.

530
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,131
Go for the centre of mass.

531
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,725
Here. The heart.

532
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,685
How apropos.

533
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,928
(INDISTINCT SPEECH ON POLICE RADIO)

534
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,048
There he is, by the stairs.

535
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,725
- Sergeant?
- We've got a clear shot and good to go.

536
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,926
On my order. Not before.

537
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,365
Received and understood.

538
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,129
What do you want me to do?

539
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,765
Kill you?

540
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,891
Forgive you?

541
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,606
I don't understand
how you could believe I did this.

542
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,126
(SCOFFS)

543
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,440
You've changed your tune
since the last time we spoke, Ian.

544
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,641
No, John.

545
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,404
I believe you did it, Ian,
because you did it!

546
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,762
If you really believe that, deep down,

547
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,091
then why did you steal the gun?

548
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,321
JOHN: <i>The gun.</i>

549
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,643
<i>Yeah, you did a decent job with that.</i>

550
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,486
But it's gone now.

551
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,720
And so is the only piece of hard
evidence they've got against me.

552
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,165
So whatever you're trying to do...

553
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,925
Whatever you're trying to do
to save yourself, it's over.

554
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,681
It's done.

555
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,807
You're not answering my question.

556
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,961
I think I am!

557
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,041
IAN: <i>But if you didn't do it,</i>

558
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,885
<i>how could there be
any hard evidence against you?</i>

559
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,691
<i>- How's that possible?
- What are you trying to say?</i>

560
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,563
I've spoken to the doctors, John.

561
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,003
And what's happening to you
is called a dissociative state.

562
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,130
It's the mind distancing itself

563
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,567
from things that are
too much for it to process.

564
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,564
You're blaming me because you can't
bear to confront what you've done.

565
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,889
You're in pain, you're distressed.

566
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,804
You need help. So come home. All right?

567
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,881
Let us help you.

568
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,131
(LAUGHS)

569
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,601
Thing is, Ian,
you didn't come alone, did you?

570
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,646
Wouldn't have the balls.

571
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,921
No, you came with CO-19, who, right now,

572
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,924
have their assault rifles
trained on my centre of mass.

573
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,408
And we do not shoot to stop.

574
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,323
Not in our game, no. We shoot to kill!

575
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,731
Ain't that right, fellas?

576
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,086
- Sergeant?
- Still clear and good to go.

577
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,406
Ain't that right, boss?

578
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,160
You got the centre of mass, right here.

579
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,208
'Cause that's what
we're here for, isn't it?

580
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,807
You prod me, you wind me up,

581
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,241
I lose it, I threaten your life.

582
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,209
And then you have
a legal reason to shoot me.

583
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,926
Bang, bang, bang. There goes your
problems, all out of the window.

584
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,641
<i>Oh, Luther, couldn't contain his temper.</i>

585
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,404
John, John, listen to me. You're ill.

586
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,644
(LAUGHS) And you're sick!

587
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,686
I wonder,

588
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,604
are you even interested
in why I've come here

589
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,841
if I knew what you was up to?

590
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,721
I don't know. Maybe you wanted to
get something off your chest.

591
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,688
About something you did
to Henry Madsen, maybe?

592
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,447
JOHN: <i>Oh, nice try, no, no.
I've got nothing to confess.</i>

593
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,641
Henry Madsen fell. And you know
how hard I tried to save him.

594
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,051
I know how hard you tried.

595
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,806
No, I...

596
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,444
I came out here...

597
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,603
Still clear, still clear.

598
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,164
(WHISPERS) ...to get you away from
the locker rooms.

599
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,485
What's he saying?

600
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,210
...where you're keeping the diamonds.

601
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,611
Or where you were,
up until about five minutes ago.

602
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,887
Oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

603
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,924
<i>Tick, tick, tick.
I wonder where they could have gone.</i>

(LAUGHING)

605
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,524
I didn't hurt Zoe, John.

606
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,523
- Ian, you do me a favour.
- What?

607
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,090
Don't say her name.

608
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,847
Not any more.
No more. All right? It's over.

609
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,844
What can I do to prove it? just tell me.

610
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,445
Tell me, tell me what I can do.

611
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,681
I actually thought
I could listen to this.

612
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,081
I thought I could stand here
and listen to you lie!

613
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,409
To my face! Even now!

614
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,564
How can you stand there
and lie like it's nothing?

615
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,687
IAN: <i>Because I didn't do it!</i>

616
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,364
He goes for a weapon, you take the shot.

617
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,441
IAN: <i>I didn't do it.</i>

618
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,091
I loved Zoe, John.
She was like family to me.

619
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,924
Wait to see a weapon,
wait to see a weapon.

620
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,606
So please, for her. For Zoe.
Please just come home.

621
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,250
- Don't!
- I love you too, man.

622
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,209
Don't say that! You piece of shit.

623
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,571
All I want to do is hear you say it.

624
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,324
Just say it one time.
Just say what you did.

625
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,250
Say it to me.

626
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,487
Ian, mate, say it to me now!

627
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,210
- I can't!
- Say it!

628
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,609
<i>No, because I didn't do it, John!</i>

629
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,966
You did.

630
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,649
OFFICER: He's got a knife.
IAN: <i>You killed her.</i>

631
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,841
It's your fault!

632
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,648
- Do it. Take the shot.
- John! Run!

633
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,241
Run!

634
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,001
Got a shot, ma'am.

635
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,560
Hold your fire! Hold your fire.
Don't shoot him in the back.

All units, be alert.
Suspect John Luther leaving the area

on foot, heading south-east, fast.

638
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,803
- Shit!
- Head him off! Stop him.

639
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,200
Do you know what you've done?

640
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,169
- Yes, I do, ma'am.
- Don't "ma'am" me.

00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,326
Badge!

642
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,131
Arrest this man.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

644
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,565
- Come on!
- Ah!

(GRUNTING)

646
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,400
Come on!

647
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,244
- Ah!
- How'd it go?

648
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,570
I got what I wanted.

649
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,969
And how close did you come
to getting shot for it?

650
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,446
I didn't get shot.

651
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,965
Fine. Your funeral.

652
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,051
That dick!

653
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,724
- Let it go.
- Would you?

654
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,044
"Run, John". What was he thinking?

655
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,724
He thought he was being John's friend

656
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,644
and it's already cost him everything.
So let it go.

657
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,890
What, you suspended him?

658
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,564
And charged him as an accessory.

659
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,485
Ripley's finished.

660
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,041
Yeah, that's what being John's
friend does for you in the end.

661
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,368
We all paid a price for it.
Come on, let's get back.

662
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,205
Just, um.

663
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,563
Once more, if I may.

664
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,243
Um, Luther came to see you,

665
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,090
- uh, he was distressed...
- He was greatly distressed, yeah.

666
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,166
It feels unseemly to keep probing this,

667
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,764
such a raw wound, so soon.

668
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,451
I must ask what he said.

669
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,130
He said he didn't do it.

670
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,523
Well, I suppose all things are possible,

671
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,965
although not equally.

672
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,486
Is this going to take much longer?

673
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,051
No, I, uh,

674
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,248
think I've got everything
I want from you.

675
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,166
If I could just ask you
to wait a little bit longer.

676
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,406
The insight you've given
into his mental state,

677
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,569
- it may be of value...
- Can I please use the bathroom?

678
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,125
Of course.

679
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,210
(INDISTINCT)

680
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,970
All right. Get on with it.

Ian?

682
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,807
Thank you.

I'm sorry the... Um, um, bathroom?

- I was...
- Oh. Yeah, yeah.

685
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,164
Yeah, it's out there, on the right.

686
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,006
The, um, flush is broken
on the cubicle nearest the wall.

687
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,320
You might want to watch that.

688
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,084
I will, thank you.

689
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,725
Listen, uh,

690
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,131
I'm sorry

691
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,082
for your loss. She was very special.

692
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,243
That's very kind. She was.

693
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,970
OFFICER: Excuse me.

694
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,482
I, uh, I need to be away from here.

695
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,288
Oh, yes, possibly that's the best thing.

696
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,121
We could arrange an escort,
a protective detail.

697
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,567
I don't think Luther will be back.
