You know,
it's good to see you, Brendan.

why don't we meet somewhere?

No.

for a patch up.

Help with what?
I don't know.

46

to know she's okay.

53
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:52,874
Anyway, Em tagged after them
for a bit,
but it didn't work out.

54

Go.

your line.

of the downfall.

in Em's troubles,
then why did her name

but it sounded like you did.

to be curious.

you know where Em's at.

00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:18,463
And why you looking for Em?

156
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:19,946
She asked for my help.

157
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:24,771
Well, listen, man, I got
plenty on my plate without
dealing with some jilted ex.

158
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:25,825
It's not about that.

159
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,965
Well, whatever it's about,
act smarter than you look
and drop it.

senses and I slept last night.

She's with me.

you, man. Came to me freaked.

172

if you came by.

00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,393
Said you'd only
make things worse.

174
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:39,520
Deal with whatever
this ain't about and drop it.

175
00:15:40,267 --> 00:15:41,576
Tell Em I wanna see her.

176
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:44,131
Tell her if she wants my help
or not, it's her business.

177
00:15:44,203 --> 00:15:46,112
But I want to hear it
straight from her.
She don't want...

178
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:48,194
Today! She knows
where I eat lunch.

179
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:49,958
And stay out, man!

180
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:48,065
I must've sounded pretty crazy
on the phone yesterday.

181
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:52,098
You just gotta
forget about it.

182
00:17:52,746 --> 00:17:55,135
That's how you can
help me out, is just,

183
00:17:55,787 --> 00:17:58,885
please, forget about it.

184
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:05,631
Brendan,

185
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:08,993
I know that you're mad
at all these people,

186
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:11,401
because you think I went away
from you and went to them.

187
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:15,263
But you got to start seeing it
as my decision.

188
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,301
You know, stop getting angry
just because where
I wanna be at

189
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,672
is different from
where you wanna be at, okay?

190
00:18:21,738 --> 00:18:23,527
Who fed you that line, Em?

191
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:28,257
Stop picking on Dode. Okay?
He's a good guy.

192
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:29,760
The Pie House rat?

193
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,585
He's a good friend.

194
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:36,132
So what am I?

195
00:18:38,954 --> 00:18:41,442
Yeah, I mean, what are you?

196
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:44,995
Eating back here,
hating everybody.

197
00:18:45,066 --> 00:18:48,099
I mean,
who are you judging anyone?

198
00:18:49,514 --> 00:18:52,994
God I...
I really loved you a lot.

199
00:18:55,274 --> 00:18:56,900
I couldn't stand it.

200
00:18:57,227 --> 00:19:01,121
I had to get with people.
I couldn't handle life
with you, anymore.

201
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,104
(SOBBING)

202
00:19:10,154 --> 00:19:13,351
I'm sorry, Brendan. I'm sorry.

203
00:19:20,714 --> 00:19:22,503
You gotta come back to me, Em.
No!

204
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,221
You're in a spot
but I can get you out of it,
if you just come back to me.

205
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,883
No, you're not hearing me!
I don't wanna be put away

206
00:19:26,954 --> 00:19:28,416
and protected.
Whatever befalls you,
I'll deal with.

207
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,439
No.

208
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:32,417
Just tell me about the trouble
with the brick, The Pin.

209
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,622
What?
Are you gonna fix things,
like you did with Jerr?

210
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,371
No. Okay?

211
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:42,090
I came here to say goodbye.
Okay? For good.

212
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:49,767
Whatever you have to do
to let me go, you gotta do it.

213
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,113
You gotta promise me, though,
okay? You have to.

214
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:01,385
That you're not... You're not
gonna torture yourself.

215
00:20:01,707 --> 00:20:02,884
Please.

216
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:06,534
That you're...
You're just gonna let me go.

217
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,395
Just let me go.

218
00:21:04,203 --> 00:21:06,177
BRAIN: Do you know
anything else about this?
BRENDAN: No.

219
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,494
Slim pickings.

220
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:09,798
Why did you let Dode fly
when he went back to,

221
00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:11,274
who's her name,
at the theater?
Kara.

222
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:13,248
It's their turf. I couldn't
hear them without being seen,

223
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:14,304
and that would only
biff their play.

224
00:21:14,378 --> 00:21:16,647
Best to know that it's there,
let it ride and see
what comes of it.

225
00:21:16,714 --> 00:21:18,951
Anyway.
Well, if this is
what I think it is,

226
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:22,794
it didn't come straight
from Dode, unless he's playing
out of his league.

227
00:21:23,178 --> 00:21:25,567
I can only give you
my best guess.
Yeah.

228
00:21:26,314 --> 00:21:28,256
When the upper crust
does shady deeds,

229
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,217
they do them in different
places around town.

230
00:21:30,283 --> 00:21:33,250
One of them is by the pier,
another one is by
the bike trails in State Park.

231
00:21:33,322 --> 00:21:34,467
I mean, there's a lot of them.

232
00:21:34,538 --> 00:21:37,320
And the pitch is, they've got
little symbols for each one.

233
00:21:37,386 --> 00:21:39,907
So they can tell each other
the place without word
getting around.

234
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:41,702
This might be that.
But Dode wouldn't know it?

235
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,657
No, this is the upper crust.
Dode's pie-pan grease.

236
00:21:43,723 --> 00:21:44,835
Call anything up?

237
00:21:44,906 --> 00:21:46,183
How many places
start with "A"?

238
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:48,193
Or if it's a shape,
could be just a random symbol.

239
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:49,990
Even if you figure it out,
what good would you do?

240
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,967
You said her business
was none of yours.

241
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:53,603
So she's all right.

242
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,393
Forget it now, go home. Sleep.

243
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,439
(FOOTSTEPS POUNDING)

244
00:25:01,642 --> 00:25:05,155
Brendan, you're up early.
Couldrt sleep.

245
00:25:06,794 --> 00:25:07,841
Find Emily?

246
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,308
You all right?

247
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,243
Yeah.
What are you here for, zero?

248
00:25:18,314 --> 00:25:21,859
Forced into taking
the early bus. The others
don't run by my street.

249
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,734
So what's the word with Em?

250
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,119
She's gone.
Can't raise her?

251
00:25:32,394 --> 00:25:33,638
No, I can't.

252
00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:39,365
So what now?

253
00:25:41,546 --> 00:25:43,935
Now, I don't know. I guess...

254
00:25:46,442 --> 00:25:47,653
I don't know.

255
00:25:52,554 --> 00:25:54,343
I can't let her go, Brain.

256
00:25:55,114 --> 00:25:57,732
I was set to, but I can't.
I don't think I can.

257
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,598
Do you think you can help her?

258
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:05,406
No.

259
00:26:06,762 --> 00:26:11,138
You think you can get
the straight, maybe break
some deserving teeth?

260
00:26:13,162 --> 00:26:14,656
Yeah, I think I could.

261
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,377
Well...

262
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,417
Tell me to walk from this,
Brain.

263
00:26:25,162 --> 00:26:28,096
Tell me to drop it.
Walk from it. Drop it.

264
00:26:30,986 --> 00:26:32,644
But you're thick, Brendan.

265
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:35,176
Yes, I am.

266
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,097
I need you to op.

267
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,162
Like on Jerr, but that was
cake to this, and unlike Jerr,

268
00:26:48,234 --> 00:26:50,209
there's not much chance
of coming out clean.

269
00:26:50,282 --> 00:26:51,776
24l7 on this one.

270
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,726
You okay to op for me again?

271
00:26:55,498 --> 00:26:57,407
So what first, tip the bulls?
No.

272
00:26:57,482 --> 00:26:58,889
Bulls would gum it.

273
00:26:58,954 --> 00:27:00,962
They'd flash their dusty
standards at the wide-eyes,

274
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:03,237
probably find some yegg
to pin, probably
even the right one.

275
00:27:03,305 --> 00:27:05,607
But they'd trample
the real tracks
and scare the real players

276
00:27:05,674 --> 00:27:06,689
back into their holes.

277
00:27:06,762 --> 00:27:10,177
If we're doing this,
I want the whole story.
No cops, not for a bit.

278
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,232
So what's first?

279
00:27:11,306 --> 00:27:12,288
I don't know.

280
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,563
Your mom still have that cell?
In her car.

281
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,422
Can I borrow it for
a few days? Get me the number?

282
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,432
Yeah.
Wait for my word.

283
00:27:19,786 --> 00:27:22,404
And cover for me first.

284
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:26,249
I'm gonna be a little late.

285
00:27:27,114 --> 00:27:28,521
BRENDAN: Stop it.
EMILY: What did you do,
Brendan?

286
00:27:28,586 --> 00:27:30,473
Are you crying for
him? You're crying for Jerr?

287
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:32,480
Trueman went straight
for him. He knew the lay!

288
00:27:32,554 --> 00:27:34,442
You ratted on Jerr!
Stop it now, Em!

289
00:27:34,506 --> 00:27:36,415
What, you telling me
it isn't true? Look at me!

290
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,919
You ratted him out,
because you were jealous!

291
00:27:37,994 --> 00:27:40,263
No, I spun on him and
I bulled the two-bit toker,

292
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,054
'cause I know what his world
would do to you!

293
00:27:42,122 --> 00:27:43,496
I love you too much
to see that!

294
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:45,318
You don't love me,
you just wanna keep me!

295
00:27:45,386 --> 00:27:47,208
You're the only thing
I love!

296
00:27:47,914 --> 00:27:49,736
You're the only thing I love!

297
00:27:50,186 --> 00:27:51,812
And this is how I do it.

298
00:27:55,626 --> 00:27:57,382
I wanna keep you safe.

299
00:28:09,674 --> 00:28:11,681
You can't keep me safe,
Brendan, all right?

300
00:28:11,754 --> 00:28:13,510
I'm in a different world now.

301
00:28:13,578 --> 00:28:16,480
And you can't keep me out
of it, and you can't beat it.

302
00:28:16,906 --> 00:28:18,597
Not if I don't want you to.

303
00:29:11,434 --> 00:29:12,644
Here's the cell number. Yeah.
Keep it on vibrate.

304
00:29:12,714 --> 00:29:14,120
Better stop meeting me
in the open, too.

305
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:16,128
I'm gonna start getting
visible. I need you
on the underneath.

306
00:29:16,202 --> 00:29:18,623
I'll call.
Trueman, the Ass.
VP, wants words.

307
00:29:18,698 --> 00:29:20,258
I'll bet he does.
Keep him off me.

308
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,337
Stonewall him, he won't bite.
Just keep him away from me.

309
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:25,257
I'll try. So what's first?
Make Em's troubles mine.

310
00:29:25,418 --> 00:29:28,549
Emily said four words I didn't
know. Tell me if they catch.

311
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,217
Brick.
No.

312
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:32,137
Or bad brick.
No.

313
00:29:32,202 --> 00:29:33,958
Tug?
Tug.

314
00:29:34,922 --> 00:29:36,416
Tug, might be a drink.

315
00:29:36,938 --> 00:29:39,807
Like milk and vodka,
or something.

316
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,523
Poor Frisco.
Frisco.

317
00:29:43,946 --> 00:29:45,440
Frisco Farr was
a sophomore last year.

318
00:29:45,514 --> 00:29:47,368
Real trash.
Maybe hit a class a week.

319
00:29:47,434 --> 00:29:49,157
Didrt know him then
and haven't seen him around.

320
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:50,633
Pin.
Pin.

321
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,417
The Pin?
The Pin, yeah?

322
00:29:53,706 --> 00:29:56,423
The Pin's kind of
a local spook story.
You know the kingpin.

323
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,734
I've heard it.
Same thing.

324
00:29:57,802 --> 00:30:00,038
Supposed to be old,
like 26. Lives in town.

325
00:30:00,105 --> 00:30:01,567
Dope runner, right?
Big time.

326
00:30:01,642 --> 00:30:05,286
See, The Pin pipes it from
the lowest scraper
to Brad Bramish himself.

327
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:09,028
Maybe. I mean, ask any
dope rat where the junk
sprang, and they'll say

328
00:30:09,097 --> 00:30:11,683
they scraped it off that,
who scored it off this,
who bought it off someone.

329
00:30:11,754 --> 00:30:15,049
After four or five
connections, the list
always end with The Pin.

330
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,830
But I bet you, you got every
rat in town together
and said show your hands

331
00:30:17,898 --> 00:30:20,800
if any of them have actually
seen The Pin, and you'd get
a crowd of full pockets.

332
00:30:20,873 --> 00:30:23,295
You think The Pin's just
a tale to take whatever heat?

333
00:30:24,266 --> 00:30:25,575
But what's first?

334
00:30:27,018 --> 00:30:28,294
A show of hands.

335
00:30:35,498 --> 00:30:38,564
Hello, Brendan,
are you here for the show?
No.

336
00:30:38,634 --> 00:30:40,674
Well, then,
could you go then, honey?
'Cause I have this headache.

337
00:30:40,746 --> 00:30:43,015
Try smoking like a chimney.
I've heard that helps.

338
00:30:43,082 --> 00:30:45,416
Hey, isn't this Dode's brand?

339
00:30:46,985 --> 00:30:49,855
You don't know Dode's brand.
I do now.

340
00:30:51,241 --> 00:30:52,551
I'm gonna start shaking
things up.

341
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:54,472
Give me the story,
you might miss the bite.

342
00:30:54,538 --> 00:30:56,676
The story about what?
All right.

343
00:30:57,162 --> 00:30:58,176
The story about what?

344
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,355
I don't want to play games
if you've got a headache.

345
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:01,538
Get me
if you want to spill it,

346
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,814
but I can't guarantee
safe passage after tonight.

347
00:31:03,882 --> 00:31:05,223
I don't know...
Tell The Pin

348
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:07,810
that Brad was my calling card,
and I need words.

349
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:09,347
Brad Bramish?

350
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:12,101
(BELL RINGING)

351
00:31:12,682 --> 00:31:15,202
Tail Kara at lunch.
She's got rehearsal,
but she'll blow early.

352
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:17,860
She goes home, drop her,
or else wait for my call.

353
00:31:18,602 --> 00:31:19,714
Will do.

354
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,102
I mean, am I crazy, huh?

355
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,887
I mean, this is all
I am trying to say here!

356
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:28,928
Okay, if you put me
in the game,

357
00:31:29,322 --> 00:31:32,421
Brad Bramish is gonna do
what needs to be done, baby.

358
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,432
Okay?
But they don't put me in!

359
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,385
What needs doing,
ain't gonna get done!

360
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:40,003
Huh? And then
don't come crying to me.

361
00:31:40,201 --> 00:31:43,714
Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo! If you don't
put me in the game!

362
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,984
Now, am I right?
Of course I'm right!

363
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,793
And don't come to me
if you don't let me play!

364
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,491
BIFF: Didrt.
BRAD: Shut up!

365
00:31:55,626 --> 00:31:56,574
Hey!

366
00:31:58,025 --> 00:32:01,287
What are you doing here?
Just listening.

367
00:32:04,874 --> 00:32:07,721
All right, you got me.
I'm a scout for the Gophers.

368
00:32:07,785 --> 00:32:11,233
Been watching your game
for a month, but that story
right there, just clenched it.

369
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:14,306
You got heart, kid. How soon
can you be in Minneapolis?

370
00:32:14,794 --> 00:32:15,841
Yeah?

371
00:32:15,913 --> 00:32:18,880
Cold winters, but they got
a great public transit system.

372
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:20,448
Yeah?
Yeah.

373
00:32:20,586 --> 00:32:21,665
Oh, yeah?

374
00:32:22,314 --> 00:32:24,899
There's a thesaurus in the
library. "Yeah" is under "Y."

375
00:32:24,969 --> 00:32:27,588
Go ahead, I'll wait.
You know, who invited you?

376
00:32:27,658 --> 00:32:29,381
To the parking lot?

377
00:32:29,705 --> 00:32:31,680
Gee, I guess I invited myself.

378
00:32:31,978 --> 00:32:35,142
Maybe you wanna
go somewhere more private.

379
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,231
With you? Sure.

380
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:51,270
If this boy knows what's good
for him, he'll just beat it.

381
00:32:52,682 --> 00:32:55,049
Whooping this small fry's butt
ain't gonna help me none.

382
00:32:55,114 --> 00:32:56,521
Sure ain't gonna help him,
neither.

383
00:32:59,818 --> 00:33:01,378
(BRAD GRUNTING)

384
00:33:05,258 --> 00:33:06,435
MAN: Come on, Brad!

385
00:33:43,497 --> 00:33:45,701
Hey, was there a fight?
Yeah.

386
00:33:54,601 --> 00:33:56,030
You're quite a pill.

387
00:33:56,265 --> 00:33:57,214
Uh-huh.

388
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,465
Where are you going?
Home.

389
00:34:01,098 --> 00:34:02,691
Why did you take
a powder the other night?

390
00:34:02,762 --> 00:34:05,445
Same reason
I'm taking one now.
Hold it!

391
00:34:06,665 --> 00:34:08,934
I wanna help you.
Go away.

392
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:17,476
Look, I can't trust you.
You ought to be smart enough
to know that.

393
00:34:17,545 --> 00:34:19,520
I didn't shake up the party
to get your attention,

394
00:34:19,594 --> 00:34:20,968
and I'm not heeling
you to hook you.

395
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:24,350
Your connections
could help me,
but the bad baggage they bring

396
00:34:24,425 --> 00:34:26,760
could make it zero sum gain
or even hurt me.

397
00:34:26,825 --> 00:34:28,614
Better off coming at it clean.

398
00:34:28,682 --> 00:34:30,242
I wouldn't have
to lead you in by the...

399
00:34:30,313 --> 00:34:32,353
I can't trust you.

400
00:34:32,426 --> 00:34:33,953
Brad was a sap, you werert.

401
00:34:34,025 --> 00:34:35,586
You're with him,
so you're playing him.

402
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:37,065
So you're a player.

403
00:34:37,162 --> 00:34:38,950
With you behind me,
I'd have to tie one eye up,

404
00:34:39,017 --> 00:34:41,668
watching both of your hands.
I can't spare it.

405
00:34:42,826 --> 00:34:45,313
You're not Brad.
No, I'm not.

406
00:34:49,513 --> 00:34:51,902
BRAIN: You didn't call.
Sorry. Kara went home though,
didn't she?

407
00:34:51,978 --> 00:34:53,222
Yeah, but she stopped
at a payphone

408
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,144
and made two calls
that she didn't want
on her phone bill.

409
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,486
Get the numbers?
No. Sorry.

410
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,114
It's all right.
Me and Brad front-page news?

411
00:34:58,186 --> 00:35:00,324
All the buzz.
You really do that?
Yeah.

412
00:35:00,393 --> 00:35:02,532
Why? Is Brad The Pin?
Brad is a sap.

413
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,390
I downed him on his field,
and his crew didn't bite.

414
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:07,556
So now I know he's a sap,
and anyone who acts like
he isn't is profiting by it.

415
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:08,967
That's not why I roughed him,
though.

416
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:10,342
For kicks?
Economics.

417
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,970
Brad's the school's biggest
jake buyer,

418
00:35:12,042 --> 00:35:14,660
so if this Pin is behind
all the selling,
I just got his attention.

419
00:35:14,729 --> 00:35:18,307
Anyway, now we've shaken
the tree, let's wait and see
what falls on our heads.

420
00:35:18,377 --> 00:35:19,326
Will do.

421
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:33,727
TRUEMAN: So you didn't know
this boy?

422
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:37,281
BRENDAN: No sir, never
seen him.
TRUEMAN: And he just hit you?

423
00:35:37,354 --> 00:35:39,558
Like I said, he asked
for my lunch money first.

424
00:35:39,626 --> 00:35:41,448
Good thing I brown-bagged it.

425
00:35:43,593 --> 00:35:46,211
Okay, Brendan, I've been
looking to talk to you.

426
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:48,642
And you've helped
this office out before.

427
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:52,936
No, I gave you Jerr to see
him eaten, not to see you fed.

428
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:54,366
Fine.

429
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:56,641
Very well put.

430
00:35:56,713 --> 00:35:59,135
Accelerated English.
Mrs. Kasprzyk.

431
00:35:59,209 --> 00:36:01,697
Tough teacher.
Tough, but fair.

432
00:36:03,401 --> 00:36:06,336
Okay, we know you're clean.

433
00:36:07,306 --> 00:36:08,647
And you've...

434
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:13,216
Despite your motives,
you've always been
an asset to this office.

435
00:36:13,993 --> 00:36:15,848
And you're a good kid.

436
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,890
I want to run some names
past you.

437
00:36:22,666 --> 00:36:25,121
Hold it, we're not done here.
I was done here
three months ago.

438
00:36:25,194 --> 00:36:27,201
I told you then I'd give
you Jerr, and that was that.

439
00:36:27,274 --> 00:36:29,478
I'm not your inside line,
and I'm not your boy.

440
00:36:29,546 --> 00:36:30,723
That's not very...
You know what I'm in

441
00:36:30,793 --> 00:36:32,386
if the wrong yegg
saw me pulled in here?

442
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:35,359
What are you in?
No.

443
00:36:35,977 --> 00:36:39,076
And no more of these informal
chats, either. You got
a discipline issue with me,

444
00:36:39,146 --> 00:36:41,088
write me up or suspend me,

445
00:36:41,162 --> 00:36:44,064
and I'll see you
at the parent conference.
Hold on!

446
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:47,141
I could write you up
for talking back to a VP

447
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:50,178
and for looking at me
in that threatening way.

448
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:53,956
I would exercise
a little tact, Mr. Frye.

449
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:58,207
You can't pull a stunt
like that unless there's
something I need you for.

450
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:01,891
So is there?
Maybe.

451
00:37:01,961 --> 00:37:03,139
Maybe.

452
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:05,736
Maybe there's something
you need from me.

453
00:37:07,145 --> 00:37:08,290
Maybe.

454
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:14,661
All right, I need you
off my back completely
for the next few weeks.

455
00:37:14,729 --> 00:37:15,973
There might be some heat soon.

456
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:18,692
If it's something
I can't cover,
I won't go to bat for you.

457
00:37:18,762 --> 00:37:20,769
If I get caught like that,
it's curtains anyway.

458
00:37:20,841 --> 00:37:22,881
I can't have brass
cutting me favors in public.

459
00:37:22,954 --> 00:37:24,361
I'm just letting you know now,

460
00:37:24,425 --> 00:37:27,873
so you don't come kicking in
my homeroom door
once trouble starts.

461
00:37:29,865 --> 00:37:33,161
Okay. Okay,
here's what I can do.

462
00:37:33,801 --> 00:37:36,452
I won't pin you for anything
you aren't caught at.

463
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:39,685
But if anything comes up
with your prints on it,
I can't help you.

464
00:37:39,753 --> 00:37:42,055
Also, if I get to the bottom
of whatever this is,

465
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:45,023
and it gets too hot,
and you don't deliver,

466
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:48,163
VP's gonna need someone
to turn over, police-wise.

467
00:37:49,545 --> 00:37:50,952
And I'll have you.

468
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:54,663
So there better be some meat
at the end of this,
like you say.

469
00:37:54,921 --> 00:37:56,710
Or at least a fall guy.

470
00:37:58,218 --> 00:37:59,461
Or you're it.

471
00:38:02,857 --> 00:38:04,516
BRAIN: Nope, Dode is MIA.

472
00:38:04,586 --> 00:38:07,007
BRENDAN: I'm 9 of 10
that Kara's got him,
but who knows where.

473
00:38:07,081 --> 00:38:08,226
I shook,
but she's not spilling.

474
00:38:08,297 --> 00:38:09,988
No more job offers,
so she's gotta play.

475
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:12,424
And I know enough about Kara
to let that worry me.

476
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:14,398
All right, keep your specs on
for him. Any other news?

477
00:38:14,473 --> 00:38:17,059
Some. Laura Dannon came to me,
looking for you.

478
00:38:18,538 --> 00:38:20,131
She did, huh?
Fourth period.

479
00:38:20,202 --> 00:38:21,576
Nearly shook me upside down.

480
00:38:21,641 --> 00:38:23,812
Can't say I didn't enjoy it.
But why'd she come to me?

481
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:25,889
She's tapping Kara,
and Kara knows you know me.

482
00:38:25,962 --> 00:38:27,206
Yeah, well,
she's some piece of work.

483
00:38:27,274 --> 00:38:29,248
If I had known where you were,
I might have told her.

484
00:38:29,321 --> 00:38:30,663
That's the spirit.

485
00:38:31,722 --> 00:38:34,089
Ask around for Dode.
Tail Kara again at lunch.

486
00:38:34,153 --> 00:38:36,062
I got knives in my eyes.
I'm going home sick.

487
00:38:36,137 --> 00:38:37,347
I'll call you tonight.
All right.

488
00:39:49,993 --> 00:39:51,170
I wanna see The Pin.

489
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:27,582
I wanna see The Pin.

490
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:32,095
I guess you do.

491
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:40,739
(CLANGING)

492
00:43:13,864 --> 00:43:14,977
You The Pin?

493
00:43:30,953 --> 00:43:31,901
Yeah.

494
00:43:38,057 --> 00:43:41,221
So now I'm very, very curious
what you're gonna say next.

495
00:43:42,505 --> 00:43:44,447
Maybe I'll just sit here
and bleed at you.

496
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,855
Helled,
if you're gonna go breaking
my best clients' noses

497
00:43:46,921 --> 00:43:48,863
and expect me to play sandbag.

498
00:43:49,992 --> 00:43:52,840
Anyway, you've been
sniffing me out before then.

499
00:43:53,545 --> 00:43:55,683
Sniffing for me
like a vampire bat

500
00:43:55,752 --> 00:43:58,305
for a horse with a nick on
its ear that he can suck on.

501
00:43:59,401 --> 00:44:00,611
They do that.

502
00:44:02,505 --> 00:44:04,807
So now you got Tugger
to bring you in,

503
00:44:06,057 --> 00:44:07,486
which he never does.

504
00:44:10,089 --> 00:44:11,747
And you got me listening.

505
00:44:12,873 --> 00:44:14,018
So I'm very curious

506
00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:17,253
what you have to say that
better be really, really good.

507
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:21,602
Why don't you call Ms. Dannon
in from the hall first?
She ought to hear this.

508
00:44:23,592 --> 00:44:25,251
No dice, soldier.

509
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:27,937
Would've been a neat trick,
though.

510
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,628
I was just gonna come up
with some bit of information

511
00:44:30,697 --> 00:44:33,348
or set up some phony deal,
anything. She'd let me walk.

512
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:36,679
Then I was gonna go to
the Vice Principal and spill
him the street address

513
00:44:36,745 --> 00:44:38,567
of the biggest dope
port in the burgh.

514
00:44:38,633 --> 00:44:39,910
He knows zippo.

515
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:43,108
1250 Vista Blanca,
the ink blotter on the desk,
in the den,

516
00:44:43,177 --> 00:44:45,959
in the basement of the house
with the tacky mailbox.

517
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:50,375
You gonna do what now?

518
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:54,786
No good, soldier.

519
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,051
All right, Tugger, enough.

520
00:44:58,889 --> 00:44:59,904
Tug!

521
00:45:00,424 --> 00:45:01,602
LAURA: Tug, stop!

522
00:45:21,161 --> 00:45:22,437
My glasses?

523
00:45:27,081 --> 00:45:29,601
The hell with you then.
Which wall is the door in?

524
00:45:49,929 --> 00:45:51,555
PIN: Sorry about this, kid.

525
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,976
But what the hell
with what you said before?

526
00:45:56,104 --> 00:45:59,966
Where you were at, with all
of us and Tug a fist away.

527
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:01,765
You gotta use your nut.

528
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:04,165
Allay the situation.

529
00:46:06,568 --> 00:46:09,984
So, yeah,
you're not scared of me.

530
00:46:10,664 --> 00:46:11,941
I got it.

531
00:46:12,841 --> 00:46:16,157
But I'm also thinking
you're a little nuts, now.

532
00:46:16,585 --> 00:46:19,170
So you've got that tradeoff
with your situation.

533
00:46:20,616 --> 00:46:22,143
But nuts isn't all bad,

534
00:46:24,329 --> 00:46:26,085
so maybe it was a good play.

535
00:46:27,561 --> 00:46:28,739
I don't know.

536
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:33,543
So Laura talked me down.

537
00:46:35,016 --> 00:46:39,326
Why don't we take
you upstairs,
back with the living?

538
00:46:40,649 --> 00:46:44,162
I thought we had orange juice,
Brendan. I'm sorry.

539
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,637
How about some Tang?

540
00:46:45,705 --> 00:46:48,771
No, that's more like soda,
isn't it?
Water's fine, ma'am. Thanks.

541
00:46:48,841 --> 00:46:51,841
Wait a minute,
we have apple juice here,
if you'd like that.

542
00:46:51,913 --> 00:46:55,491
Or we've got milk,
but you're having that
on your corn flakes.

543
00:46:55,561 --> 00:46:56,771
BRENDAN: Apple juice
sounds terrific.

544
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,182
It's country style.

545
00:46:58,249 --> 00:46:59,231
That's perfect.

546
00:46:59,305 --> 00:47:01,312
And I'll even give it to you
in a little country glass.

547
00:47:01,384 --> 00:47:02,628
How about that?

548
00:47:04,617 --> 00:47:07,268
Boys?
I'm fine, Mrs. M.

549
00:47:08,297 --> 00:47:09,475
Thanks, Mom.

550
00:47:10,345 --> 00:47:11,905
Okay, well,

551
00:47:12,873 --> 00:47:16,615
I'm gonna go do something
in the other room.

552
00:47:22,697 --> 00:47:26,853
So how abouts we take another
snap at hearing your tale?

553
00:47:26,921 --> 00:47:30,052
I don't know. It starts out
same as before. I mean,
this floor ain't carpeted.

554
00:47:30,121 --> 00:47:31,103
We're cooled off.

555
00:47:31,177 --> 00:47:33,926
Your muscle seemed pretty cool
putting his fist in my head.

556
00:47:33,993 --> 00:47:35,236
I want him out.

557
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,582
Looky, soldier...
The ape blows or I clam.

558
00:47:39,913 --> 00:47:40,960
So clam!

559
00:47:41,033 --> 00:47:44,262
What've you got
I can't beat out of you
back in the basement?

560
00:47:51,945 --> 00:47:53,952
Give us a few minutes, Tug.

561
00:47:56,776 --> 00:47:58,435
I'll call you if whatever.

562
00:48:11,753 --> 00:48:12,800
So?

563
00:48:16,264 --> 00:48:19,493
About a year ago,
I had a small-time dealing
partnership with Jerr Madison.

564
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,927
Know him?
Till he took the fall for you.

565
00:48:21,993 --> 00:48:22,941
Yeah, well.

566
00:48:23,017 --> 00:48:25,057
I didn't ask him to,
but he was a straight player,

567
00:48:25,129 --> 00:48:28,096
and I got out clean, almost.

568
00:48:29,033 --> 00:48:32,481
Nothing on my official record,
but the VPs play it
like I owe them one.

569
00:48:32,553 --> 00:48:35,008
When I made it clear
I wasrt gonna be playing
their hound dog,

570
00:48:35,081 --> 00:48:36,510
well, they didn't like it.

571
00:48:36,584 --> 00:48:38,788
They keep badgering me,
calling me in.

572
00:48:38,856 --> 00:48:42,271
Gee, that's tough.
I don't like being told
whose side I'm on.

573
00:48:43,656 --> 00:48:45,991
So now they think
I'm on your trail.

574
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:49,350
I'm in a nice spot
to know their movements,

575
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:50,910
feed them yours.

576
00:48:52,073 --> 00:48:54,145
I got you.
You haven't got me, yet.

577
00:48:55,528 --> 00:48:57,416
What? Price?

578
00:48:57,481 --> 00:48:59,586
Considering the benefits
my services could yield,

579
00:48:59,657 --> 00:49:01,031
I don't think
that's unreasonable.

580
00:49:01,096 --> 00:49:03,169
And what are your services
exactly?

581
00:49:04,072 --> 00:49:06,177
So I can be specific
on the invoice.

582
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,470
Whatever serves
your interests.

583
00:49:12,585 --> 00:49:13,697
Fair enough.

584
00:49:15,784 --> 00:49:18,206
I'll have my boys
check your tale,

585
00:49:19,017 --> 00:49:22,629
and seeing how it stretches,
we'll either rub or hire you.

586
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:26,436
You'll know which by the end
of the day tomorrow.

587
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,367
We're done.

588
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,749
I'll drive you back.

589
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,921
Just drop me at school.

590
00:49:45,033 --> 00:49:48,164
How long was I out?
Half an hour.

591
00:49:48,553 --> 00:49:51,138
It took all of it for me
to cool The Pin down.

592
00:49:53,736 --> 00:49:54,881
Thanks.

593
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,975
You trust me now?

594
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:18,947
Less now than when
I didn't trust you before.

595
00:50:19,112 --> 00:50:22,146
Maybe if you can tell me
your angle in all this,
I could.

596
00:50:22,792 --> 00:50:24,865
Emily tried to get with Brad
and I about three months ago.

597
00:50:24,937 --> 00:50:26,463
Three months ago.
And you stonewalled her.

598
00:50:26,536 --> 00:50:29,700
Oh, all right.
If you've already got
the world's address...

599
00:50:32,777 --> 00:50:34,086
Three months ago.

600
00:50:34,857 --> 00:50:37,312
And I liked her, but she
wasrt us and it didn't work.

601
00:50:37,384 --> 00:50:40,351
And when she left, she took
some souvenirs with her.

602
00:50:40,649 --> 00:50:42,536
Dirty habits she wasrt
strong enough to control

603
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,608
and a connection to The Pin
to keep them going.

604
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,436
A few months pass,
and the next I hear,

605
00:50:46,505 --> 00:50:50,116
The Pin's raging over
a certain situation with
the junk Em's partial to.

606
00:50:50,184 --> 00:50:51,679
And it's all coming
down on her head.

607
00:50:51,752 --> 00:50:54,273
You're saying Em scraped
the junk off The Pin?

608
00:50:54,345 --> 00:50:56,352
I don't care how hard she was
hooked, I don't buy that.

609
00:50:56,425 --> 00:50:59,458
You werert there. She wasrt
herself. It had dug deep.

610
00:51:00,617 --> 00:51:02,024
It was awful.

611
00:51:02,344 --> 00:51:03,970
And whether she scraped
or copped

612
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:06,943
or just ran her tab around the
world and into her own back,

613
00:51:07,016 --> 00:51:08,543
it must've been grand.

614
00:51:08,616 --> 00:51:10,820
I've never seen
The Pin so hot.

615
00:51:11,656 --> 00:51:14,591
And when he thought
his precious, his bricks
of whatever it was,

616
00:51:14,665 --> 00:51:16,487
when one of them was missing,

617
00:51:17,481 --> 00:51:18,658
he scared me.

618
00:51:19,688 --> 00:51:22,558
Why are you telling me
all this? What's your play?

619
00:51:23,944 --> 00:51:25,919
You think nobody sees you.

620
00:51:27,528 --> 00:51:29,700
Eating lunch
behind the portables.

621
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:34,338
Loving some girl
like she's all there is,
anywhere, to you.

622
00:51:36,297 --> 00:51:38,020
I always seen you.

623
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:40,615
Or maybe I liked Emily.

624
00:51:41,993 --> 00:51:44,840
Maybe I see what
you're trying to do for her,

625
00:51:45,321 --> 00:51:46,979
trying to help her,

626
00:51:48,488 --> 00:51:51,554
and I don't know anybody
who would do that for me.

627
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:54,789
Now you are dangerous.

628
00:52:03,432 --> 00:52:06,694
Devlin, should
I actually kiss her here?
No, no.

629
00:52:06,761 --> 00:52:08,190
Move on to the next scene.

630
00:52:12,009 --> 00:52:15,304
Brendan. Brendan. Brendan.

631
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,182
Where's Dode flopped?

632
00:52:18,856 --> 00:52:21,442
I know you two are cozed up,
so you tell me or you won't.

633
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,618
Now, last time I checked,

634
00:52:25,736 --> 00:52:27,460
you were giving me ultimatums.

635
00:52:27,529 --> 00:52:30,463
It worked. You went
to Laura, told her my tale.

636
00:52:30,761 --> 00:52:32,833
Part of the plan?
Turned out to be.

637
00:52:34,472 --> 00:52:36,360
I just feel so cheap and used.

638
00:52:36,424 --> 00:52:40,253
Gol, I must seem a real cad.
Sometimes I just hate myself.

639
00:52:40,969 --> 00:52:44,231
Whatever happened to us,
Brendan?
Where's Dode flopped?

640
00:52:44,297 --> 00:52:46,533
We used to be
a pair and a half.

641
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:49,925
Sometimes I miss
having someone to talk to.

642
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,077
Do you ever miss
having someone to talk to?

643
00:52:56,169 --> 00:52:57,346
Oh, yeah.

644
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,130
You must.

645
00:53:00,361 --> 00:53:03,939
I need to hear Dode's tale
about Emily. It's important.

646
00:53:04,201 --> 00:53:07,496
Well, you better be sure
you wanna know
what you wanna know.

647
00:53:10,984 --> 00:53:14,596
Laura's working with me now,
and I'll have The Pin
and Tug in my corner soon.

648
00:53:14,665 --> 00:53:18,626
The sooner I get the truth
from Dode, or the truth
about Dode from you,

649
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:20,550
the safer you'll both be.

650
00:53:21,768 --> 00:53:22,717
No?

651
00:53:22,984 --> 00:53:24,577
Pass it on to Dode, anyway.

652
00:53:24,648 --> 00:53:28,063
Maybe he'll have the sense
to get out from under you
before he gets hurt.

653
00:53:28,136 --> 00:53:29,445
You didn't.

654
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,618
Did you?

655
00:53:34,536 --> 00:53:37,122
BRAIN: So Dode and Kara
are shacked up,
but what's their play?

656
00:53:37,193 --> 00:53:40,673
BRENDAN: I don't know,
Dode passed Emily the note.
He knows something.

657
00:53:40,744 --> 00:53:43,843
Now Kara's got him under
her thumb, she's gonna use
him somehow.

658
00:53:43,913 --> 00:53:46,214
But I don't know
and I don't know.

659
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,736
So all we can do is wait
until she shows some cards.

660
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:52,551
Anyway, tomorrow we see
if The Pin hires me
or breaks my knees.

661
00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:57,860
I give us 70-30. And if we're
in, I get under his skin
and see what's what.

662
00:53:58,344 --> 00:54:01,410
You stick to Kara. Keep your
specs peeled for Dode.

663
00:54:01,768 --> 00:54:03,710
And stay away from Laura.

664
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,316
I think she's with us,
Brendan.

665
00:54:05,384 --> 00:54:07,424
I'll let you know when she is.

666
00:54:07,496 --> 00:54:08,544
Okay.

667
00:54:13,384 --> 00:54:15,239
(BELL RINGING)

668

social calls.

1008
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:19,554
So what are the stats?

1009
01:21:20,007 --> 01:21:22,560
The stats are war.
Tug got hot. He panicked.

1010
01:21:22,631 --> 01:21:24,289
Tug's been after my digs
from the get-go.

1011
01:21:24,359 --> 01:21:26,847
No, he's been anxious,
'cause he thought if you
found out he killed Emily,

1012
01:21:26,919 --> 01:21:27,966
you'd turn him over.

1013
01:21:28,039 --> 01:21:29,664
He was right.
Yeah, well.

1014
01:21:30,342 --> 01:21:34,052
I told him to get this
straight, no roughing.
I wasrt even there.

1015
01:21:34,119 --> 01:21:36,541
All right, so he's a hothead.
So you don't want him
on your side.

1016
01:21:36,614 --> 01:21:38,916
At least let's have a pow-wow
before we start
digging trenches.

1017
01:21:38,982 --> 01:21:41,371
Maybe we can all walk away
amiable enemies.

1018
01:21:43,334 --> 01:21:44,861
Yeah, all right.

1019
01:21:45,063 --> 01:21:46,753

Tomorrow?

1020
01:21:46,822 --> 01:21:49,670
Tonight.
Let's clear it all
before it boils up again.

1021
01:21:50,887 --> 01:21:51,999
Wait!

1022
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:55,266
I'll drive you back.

1023
01:21:59,271 --> 01:22:00,383
So here's the sit.

1024
01:22:00,454 --> 01:22:02,047
You and The Pin
are gonna pow-wow, tonight.

1025

4:00, his place.

1026
01:22:03,494 --> 01:22:05,349
Bring all the muscle you want,
you won't need it.

1027
01:22:05,414 --> 01:22:06,363
He wants to talk straight,

1028
01:22:06,439 --> 01:22:08,381
and you're gonna work with him
for whatever he needs.

1029
01:22:08,455 --> 01:22:10,309
'Cause you don't want war.
The hell I don't.

1030
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:13,189
The Pin's sitting on
the brick profits.
Hitting him now would be post.

1031
01:22:13,255 --> 01:22:15,262
Make peace,
wait for your chance.

1032
01:22:15,655 --> 01:22:17,565
He's right, Tug.
Smooth it out.

on the Dode thing.

1035
01:22:21,574 --> 01:22:24,608
War will mean you versus him
and every bull in the burgh.

1036
01:22:25,735 --> 01:22:27,295
Yeah, we'll talk.

1037
01:22:28,135 --> 01:22:29,542

Yeah.

I'm sorry, Brendan.

1042
01:23:27,718 --> 01:23:29,125
I'm so sorry.

1043
01:24:19,398 --> 01:24:20,958
Don't go tonight.

1044
01:24:23,238 --> 01:24:25,824
I gotta make sure
everything plays out smooth.

1045
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:29,220
It'll play out
however it plays,
without you there.

1046
01:24:29,287 --> 01:24:31,075
I gotta make sure.

1047
01:24:31,367 --> 01:24:32,447
Why?

1048
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:34,852
'Cause if there's war,
I'm in it, too.

1049
01:24:41,478 --> 01:24:43,005
I'm just scared.

1050
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:45,988
If things go bad tonight...

1051
01:24:47,398 --> 01:24:48,925
Just be careful.

1052
01:25:22,726 --> 01:25:24,581

Yeah.

1053
01:25:24,646 --> 01:25:26,337

I'll go first in yours.

Draw off any tailers.

might even radio back

I don't smoke.
I've seen you smoke.

I don't smoke cigarettes.

I'm gonna be out of The Pin's
by 4:15.

1064
01:25:49,415 --> 01:25:52,731
So at exactly 4:15,
you put an anonymous call
into the bulls.

1065
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:56,227
You tell them there are drugs
in the trunk
of the black Mustang

Laura's inside.

1070

She hasn't got a car, but if
she blows on foot or gets
a pick, tail her. All right?

1071
01:26:11,815 --> 01:26:13,603
All right?
Okay.

1072
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:17,917
I'll call you
when it gets light.

01:26:22,022 --> 01:26:23,298

I want full assurance that
any heat from Emily and Dode
is on just you.

I don't even want my name
pulled into the shindig.

1078

1080
01:27:34,215 --> 01:27:37,149

that they'll be home
in not too much time.

1081
01:27:37,222 --> 01:27:39,426
That's square.
You did them, after all.

1082
01:27:39,494 --> 01:27:41,828
Lay low, it'll blow over.
Stick on this,

1083

to bury the other.
You'll both get the rap.

1084
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:47,518
As for the six,
did you borrow it?

1085
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:49,117
Yeah.

1086
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:51,873

a shake on that.

1092
01:28:03,142 --> 01:28:05,149
I'm gonna start selling it.

1094
01:28:07,654 --> 01:28:10,142
Why would it be?
Why was the last one?

1095
01:28:11,559 --> 01:28:13,533
Because someone got greedy.

1096
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:18,754
Tug here's had the means to
swipe half of it and
cut it bad for a long time.

1097
01:28:19,142 --> 01:28:21,989
Now we're splits,
the loss of my trust
is retroactive.

1098
01:28:22,054 --> 01:28:25,022
Did you, Tug?
No.

1099
01:28:25,095 --> 01:28:27,942

let's shake and blow.
Not good enough.

just to prove it.

01:34:19,078 --> 01:34:21,762
You did all of this
because you loved her.

1176
01:34:22,598 --> 01:34:24,354
And now it's finished.

1177
01:34:25,766 --> 01:34:26,714
No.

1178
01:34:29,862 --> 01:34:30,909
What?

1179
01:34:31,621 --> 01:34:33,247
It's not finished.

1180
01:34:34,470 --> 01:34:37,187
Tug pulled the trigger on Em,
and he got the fall for it.

1181
01:34:37,254 --> 01:34:40,156
But the bulls could have
found that out without me.

1182
01:34:40,230 --> 01:34:44,124
I set out to know who put her
in the spot, who put her
in front of the gun.

1183
01:34:45,702 --> 01:34:47,393
That was you, angel.

1184
01:34:49,062 --> 01:34:51,069
What are you talking about?

1185
01:34:52,518 --> 01:34:53,827
It was you.

1186
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:59,484
Brendan.
What?

1187
01:35:01,542 --> 01:35:04,476
You want the whole tale?
You want me to tell it to you?

1188
01:35:05,094 --> 01:35:06,555
Tell it to me.

1189
01:35:10,277 --> 01:35:12,579
All right, from the top.

1190
01:35:15,142 --> 01:35:17,825
You had your fingers
in Brad Bramish
for appearances

1191
01:35:17,894 --> 01:35:21,123
and to keep him buying
from The Pin,
who you were hooked with.

1192
01:35:21,189 --> 01:35:24,353
When Emily came
to you and Brad,
you saw her for what she was,

1193
01:35:24,421 --> 01:35:26,788
an insecure little girl
trying to get in.

1194
01:35:27,686 --> 01:35:29,726
She goes on the back burner.

1195
01:35:30,822 --> 01:35:33,757
Meanwhile,
maybe you're getting bored,
or maybe just greedy,

1196
01:35:33,830 --> 01:35:36,218
but when The Pin scores big
with the bricks,
you take your shot.

1197
01:35:36,294 --> 01:35:39,906
You hook one, take half,
cut it back to size,
but you cut it back bad.

1198
01:35:40,006 --> 01:35:43,519
Maybe accidentally,
maybe to down The Pin's
operation, doesn't matter.

1199
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:47,681
You put it back.
Poor Frisco doses off it
and lands in a coma.

1200
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:51,070
So now The Pin's fuming,
maybe he's jealous of Brad,

1201
01:35:51,142 --> 01:35:53,924
so he comes to Brad's car
looking for blood,
or at least a scape.

1202
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:57,306
You're in big trouble.
There's gonna be a war
over this.

1203
01:35:57,990 --> 01:36:01,852
And there's Emily.
She trusts you.
She wants in.

1204
01:36:03,174 --> 01:36:04,451
It's duck soup.
No!

1205
01:36:04,518 --> 01:36:06,754
You frame her
for the bad brick,
then you cut her loose.

1206
01:36:06,821 --> 01:36:08,676
You turn on your heel
and bite her in the throat.

1207
01:36:08,741 --> 01:36:10,847
Last week at the payphone,
Del Rio and Sarmentoso,

1208
01:36:10,918 --> 01:36:12,576
she saw something
she was scared of.

1209
01:36:12,646 --> 01:36:14,882
Tug's car driving by,
The Pin riding shotgun.

1210
01:36:14,949 --> 01:36:16,411
But she wouldn't have seen
The Pin.

1211
01:36:16,486 --> 01:36:20,479
No, she was across the street,
angel. She saw the
driver's side. She saw you.

1212
01:36:21,446 --> 01:36:24,261
She saw you, and she ran
like she saw some devil.

1213
01:36:24,518 --> 01:36:25,598
Brendan, why...

1214
01:36:25,669 --> 01:36:28,222
She took the hit,
Dode hid her away,
but The Pin was on to her.

1215
01:36:28,293 --> 01:36:30,660
He tracked her down
and told her to meet,
that they'd make good.

1216
01:36:30,726 --> 01:36:33,660
He gave her a time and a place
and sent Tug.
Just to get the straight.

1217
01:36:33,734 --> 01:36:36,800
But maybe you had
talked Tug up.
Or maybe he just blew a fuse.

1218
01:36:36,870 --> 01:36:38,812
But when Em sprung it on him
that she had her kid,

1219
01:36:38,886 --> 01:36:41,569
he did what anyone could
count on Tug doing.

1220
01:36:41,894 --> 01:36:43,203
He hit her.

1221
01:36:43,366 --> 01:36:46,432
She took the hit for you,
and you let her take it.

1222
01:36:46,502 --> 01:36:47,647
Stop! Stop!
That's the tale.

1223
01:36:47,718 --> 01:36:50,620
Are you gonna tell me
it's not?
Stop it. It's not.

1224
01:36:56,934 --> 01:36:58,876
Will you tell me it's not?

1225
01:36:59,078 --> 01:37:00,223
It's not.

1226
01:37:05,446 --> 01:37:06,875
It isn't true.

1227
01:37:09,766 --> 01:37:11,293
I hope it isn't.

1228
01:37:13,286 --> 01:37:16,101
I want you to have been
on my side all along,

1229
01:37:17,286 --> 01:37:19,774
not just trying
to get me under your thumb,

1230
01:37:20,166 --> 01:37:22,948
like Brad and The Pin and Tug.

1231
01:37:24,485 --> 01:37:26,428
But I think you knew
that party was gonna blow up.

1232
01:37:26,501 --> 01:37:28,509
I think that was
your final play.

1233
01:37:30,214 --> 01:37:31,937
But I hope I'm wrong.

1234
01:37:34,181 --> 01:37:36,286
I hope everything
I wrote in the note

1235
01:37:36,357 --> 01:37:39,805
that I dropped
at Gary Truemars office
this morning is wrong.

1236
01:37:40,454 --> 01:37:43,749
About your and Brad's
involvement
in The Pin's runnings.

1237
01:37:45,670 --> 01:37:49,826
And I hope you didn't steal
the brick last night
in your purse.

1238
01:37:51,430 --> 01:37:52,674
I didn't.

1239
01:37:53,733 --> 01:37:54,781
Good.

1240
01:37:56,134 --> 01:37:59,614
That means you didn't
let me walk into
a slaughterhouse.

1241
01:38:00,166 --> 01:38:03,843
And you didn't lead
The Pin and Tug and
their crews to the slaughter.

1242
01:38:04,997 --> 01:38:09,056
And when Trueman
reads my note, takes my cue
and searches your locker,

1243
01:38:10,501 --> 01:38:12,508
he won't find a damn thing.

1244
01:38:26,725 --> 01:38:27,903
Brendan,

1245
01:38:29,446 --> 01:38:30,875
don't do this.

1246
01:38:37,093 --> 01:38:38,370
It's done.

1247
01:38:39,782 --> 01:38:40,829
Done?

1248
01:38:47,526 --> 01:38:49,413
Well, that's most of it.

1249
01:38:50,566 --> 01:38:52,060
Nine out of 10.

1250
01:38:54,182 --> 01:38:56,702
I told Em to tell Tugger
it was his.

1251
01:38:58,149 --> 01:39:00,320
Told her it would
soften him up.

1252
01:39:03,461 --> 01:39:07,106
She said she wished she could
keep it, but she didn't
love the father.

1253
01:39:09,125 --> 01:39:12,159
I was gonna drive her down
to the doctor the next day.

1254
01:39:12,678 --> 01:39:14,139
Most wouldn't.

1255
01:39:15,046 --> 01:39:17,347
She was already
starting to show.

1256
01:39:18,821 --> 01:39:20,228
Three months.

1257
01:39:22,534 --> 01:39:24,705
Do you know whose kid
that makes it?

1258
01:39:26,566 --> 01:39:28,605
Or have you known all along?

1259
01:39:32,134 --> 01:39:34,338
Mother...

1260
01:39:53,733 --> 01:39:55,904
You get your straight?
Yeah.

1261
01:39:55,974 --> 01:39:58,340
I wouldn't have, if I...
It's all right.

1262
01:40:00,326 --> 01:40:04,003
Chuck Burns came to.
The knife guy. He spilled
it all to the bulls.

1263
01:40:04,197 --> 01:40:07,972
Turns out Brad Bramish
hired him on his own.
It was just a grudge thing.

1264
01:40:08,485 --> 01:40:09,532
Fits.

1265
01:40:11,206 --> 01:40:13,573
You did good, Brain. Go sleep.

1266
01:40:14,630 --> 01:40:16,059
Yeah. You, too.

1267
01:40:23,686 --> 01:40:25,475
What'd she whisper to you?

1268
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:32,157
She called me a dirty word.

1269
01:40:34,246 --> 01:40:36,734
All right,
you don't have to tell me.
