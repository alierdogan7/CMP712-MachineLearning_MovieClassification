1
00:00:57,941 --> 00:01:02,537
I'm Erica Bain. And as you know,
I walk the city.

2
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:08,139
I bitch and moan about it.
I walk and watch and listen...

3
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:11,244
...a witness to all
the beauty and ugliness...

4
00:01:11,254 --> 00:01:14,481
...that is disappearing
from our beloved city.

5
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,283
Last week took me to
the gray depths of the East River...

6
00:01:17,293 --> 00:01:20,620
...where Dimitri Panchenko
swims his morning laps...

7
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,370
...Iike he has every morning
since the 1960s.

8
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:30,964
Today I walked by the acres of scaffolding
outside what used to be the Plaza Hotel...

9
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:33,636
...and I thought about Eloise.

10
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,641
Remember Kay Thompson's Eloise?

11
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:39,873
Eloise who lived in the Plaza Hotel...

12
00:01:39,883 --> 00:01:44,177
...with her dog Weenie and her parents,
who were always away...

13
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:48,848
...and her English nanny who had
eight hairpins made out of bones.

14
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:54,468
That Eloise. The adored brat
of my childhood. A little punk kid....

15
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:59,559
Sid Vicious, spewing beer from his teeth
in the Chelsea Hotel.

16
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:02,162
Andy Warhol, his sunglasses....

17
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:07,200
Edgar Allan Poe, freeing live monkeys
from the crates of a crumbling schooner...

18
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,509
...on the oily slips of South Street.

19
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,807
Stories of a city...

20
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:17,677
...that is disappearing before our eyes.
Its people swept over....

21
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:20,313
So, what will be left of those stories?

22
00:02:20,323 --> 00:02:25,718
Are we going to have to construct an
imaginary city to house our memories?

23
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:30,190
Because when you love something,
every time a bit of it goes...

24
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,260
...you lose a piece of yourself.

25
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,997
So where's Eloise going to sleep tonight?
Can you hear her ghost...

26
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:42,335
...wandering around the collapsing
corridors of her beloved Plaza...

27
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:44,737
...trying to find her nanny's room...

28
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,841
...calling out
to the construction workers...

29
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:50,581
...in a voice that nobody hears:

30
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:54,746
" Has anyone seen my turtle,
Skipperdee? "

31
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:59,853
This is Erica Bain, and you've been listening
to Street Walk on WNKW.

32
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:02,923
-And this is 90.1, WNKW.
-All right.

33
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:07,588
-See you next week.
-Have a good one, Erica.

34
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:12,131
Hey, I'm out of here.

35
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:14,601
Did Eloise really mean that much to you?

36
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,670
Oh, come on, Carol.
Weren't you ever a little girl?

37
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,974
Not the kind of little girl that
remembers the name of her turtle.

38
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:22,980
Anyway, good show.

39
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,279
Look, Bravo called again
about that TV spot.

40
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,248
You know what? I'm--

41
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:30,750
I'm not a face. I'm just a voice.

42
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,920
The shows are on the website.
People can download them for free.

43
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,160
-Yeah, exactly.
-Maybe.

44
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,467
Bye.

45
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,297
-Hello?
-Hey.

46
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,731
-Hello.
-What are you wearing?

47
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:48,768
Green scrubs, tied at the waist,
very sexy V-neck.

48
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:51,704
-Short-sleeved little number.
-How about the sexy green hat?

49
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:53,206
-Still got that?
-In my hand.

50
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,476
You like it more than the others,
less than the others or the same?

51
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,977
Oh, yeah. I'm at the place...

52
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,648
...and I wanna make sure you're still okay
with the cream and the orange.

53
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,049
Yeah, cream and orange.

54
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:05,818
Actually, it's not cream.
It's vanilla. But that's fine.

55
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,553
It's not cream. It's vanilla.

56
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:11,157
-Who cares? Let's go get married tonight.
-Your mother cares.

57
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,559
Trust me, she wants invitations.

58
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:15,695
Yeah, these are good. Thanks.

59
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:19,232
Hey, listen. For tonight, if you meet me
at Nicole's art thing...

60
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:21,367
...you don't have to
talk to anyone but me.

61
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:23,136
-Maybe.
-Come on.

62
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:26,439
-I've got a game, haven't l?
-You're not coming?

63
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:28,641
-Look, I've gotta go.
-What?

64
00:04:28,651 --> 00:04:30,310
I do love you.

65
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,720
Yeah. I love you too.

66
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:36,167
-Hi.
-Hi. Oh, you're James.

67
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,351
-I'm Erica. I'm Nicole's friend.
-Hi.

68
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,254
These are good.
They're really cool. I love them.

69
00:04:41,264 --> 00:04:45,224
The Laundromat is in a town in Jersey
where Diane Arbus used to do her laundry.

70
00:04:45,234 --> 00:04:49,162
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, that gun store is down in Chinatown.

71
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:51,931
Berenice Abbott shot it in the '30s.

72
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:55,001
It's really evocative, you know?

73
00:04:55,178 --> 00:04:58,771
Kind of quiet. I like that.
It doesn't make too much noise.

74
00:04:58,781 --> 00:04:59,973
Thanks.

75
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:02,375
Bring more drinks, less shrimp. More.

76
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,110
Where you going? You're leaving?

77
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,647
-No, no. I'm staying. I'm staying.
-Oh, my God, you're such a bad liar.

78
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:08,915
I know, but I try.

79
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:11,651
You have to convince him
to come to one of these things.

80
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:14,187
He can't avoid us forever. Oh, my God.

81
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:16,789
-What are you doing here?
-Don't you love this woman?

82
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:19,926
I could take her or leave her.
You guys...

83
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:22,161
...this, when it starts, it's disgusting.

84
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:23,863
-We have to go.
-You're too happy.

85
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:25,064
-Say goodbye.
-Bye.

86
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,332
-I hate you.
-I love you.

87
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:28,892
I really-- I hate you so much.

88
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:36,177
Oh, God. It's so pretty out.

89
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:39,212
Tell you what. I'll get him.
You sit here. Okay?

90
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:41,281
No, let me get him.

91
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:44,117
-Okay. Will you get me my jacket too?
-Fine.

92
00:05:44,127 --> 00:05:46,561
Here. Take this.

93
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,729
Thanks.

94
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:57,230
Hey.

95
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,970
Oh, I can open my own door.

96
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:03,044
Thank you.

97
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:16,155
Good boy. Good boy.

98
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:19,893
-Hi, puppy!
-Here.

99
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:24,824
Are you gonna be that crabby
when you get older?

100
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:27,564
I am older. And I'm way meaner.

101
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:31,052
Look, she gave me an apple. Here, baby.

102
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:37,446
-So she is human.
-That was too big a bite.

103
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:42,442
That was too big a bite.
I didn't say you could eat the whole thing.

104
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:43,976
You know what?

105
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:49,682
I could get about maybe five days and we
could go to the place with the water and...

106
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:53,287
...find good food and lots of sleeping.

107
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:55,463
Yes, I concur.

108
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,699
Here, boy. Good boy.

109
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:02,803
Good boy.

110
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,310
Don't give it to him. Throw it.

111
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:17,477
-I wasn't mucking about, you know.
-What about?

112
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:20,446
Why can't we go down
to city hall tonight?

113
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:23,601
-Because it's closed.
-Tomorrow, then.

114
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:27,186
David, you have a family.
I don't, you know?

115
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:31,616
-You're not marrying my family.
-Well, I am, kind of.

116
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,496
I mean, I hope I am.

117
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:41,400
Your mom is so sweet and she just--
She wants the whole deal, you know?

118
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,072
She wants the invitations...

119
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:48,843
...and the band playing and the minister.

120
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,346
I don't know. Maybe I do too,
you know? Because...

121
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:56,841
...it's not like I'm gonna do this twice.

122
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,560
You're not?

123
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:02,791
No, I'm not.

124
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,255
That's the nicest thing
you ever said to me.

125
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:27,346
Where's Curtis?

126
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:29,248
Oi, Curtis!

127
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,258
Come on, boy.

128
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,399
Come on, pup! Did he go up there?

129
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:37,890
-He's not in there, is he?
-Come on!

130
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,900
Curtis?

131
00:08:41,837 --> 00:08:43,837
Hey!

132
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:45,973
-There he is.
-Curtis.

133
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,582
-Come on, boy.
-Curtis, come on.

134
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:57,710
Hey, Curtis?

135
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,484
-Hey.
-Curtis.

136
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:06,227
Hey.

137
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:10,723
-What's up, boy?
-What's wrong, sweetheart?

138
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:12,191
Hey.

139
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:14,794
Man, don't you know
there's a fucking leash law?

140
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,864
Yeah, don't you fucking know better?

141
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,833
Yeah. I'm sorry. Thanks for finding him.

142
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:24,328
It's-- It's all good, bro. It's all good.

143
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,472
But...

144
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,117
...I get a reward or something?

145
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:35,481
Our gratitude. Now give him to me.

146
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,618
Come on, man. You know gratitude
ain't worth shit around here.

147
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:41,020
-You're hurting him!
-Give me the dog.

148
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:45,091
No, I don't think so.
See, I kind of like this dog.

149
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:47,821
I think he's a keeper. A keeper.

150
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,170
Smile, baby.

151
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,639
-You are a cunt.
-Fuck you, bitch!

152
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:04,710
Come on, motherfucker.
That's what I thought, you stupid pussy.

153
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,679
-Look....
-Go.

154
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,348
I haven't got much money.
You can have what I've got.

155
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,718
Give me your watch, give me your
ring. Let's go, I ain't got all day.

156
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:14,887
Hurry the fuck up, princess.

157
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:17,223
-Let's go. Hurry up!
-Give him the shit.

158
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:19,783
-Get the fuck over here.
-Fuck!

159
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:23,737
-David!
-I fucking missed it!

160
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:25,331
Where you going?

161
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:28,656
-Action!
-Think you're fucking with me?!

162
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,711
You just made my day!

163
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,186
Popped your motherfucking cherry!

164
00:10:35,484 --> 00:10:37,484
Let's even shit out.

165
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,212
Ready for your close-up, cunt?!

166
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,814
Heads up!

167
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:43,015
Hollywood!

168
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:45,575
Think you're fucking with me?!

169
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:51,479
You ain't got nothing to say now, fool!

170
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:55,527
-David.
-Oh, how cute. Lovebirds.

171
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:59,870
-A chickenhead and a faggot.
-Say "cheese," bitch!

172
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:06,699
This is the emergency room.

173
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,668
-Did you get any sleep?
-No. Where's Murrow?

174
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:11,604
We're looking for him.

175
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:15,207
She was dead on arrival
and her fingerprints are all over the gun.

176
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:17,217
-Where?
-Bedroom.

177
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,315
Daughter called 911.

178
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:22,154
Thanks. I wanna see her.

179
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:33,657
-So he's laughing again.
-Yeah.

180
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:44,657
Listen, the kid's in a waiting room
with ACS. I'll meet you over there.

181
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:52,041
We need your signature right here.

182
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,523
Where is she?

183
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:06,089
-Can I talk to her?
-You can try.

184
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:10,337
Hey, sweetie.

185
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,667
Can I have a word with you?

186
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:18,543
We're just gonna be right here.
All right.

187
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:21,807
You like lollipops?

188
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,061
Pick one.

189
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:39,255
That was the one I was gonna pick.

190
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,572
You know, sweetie...

191
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:52,938
...something you should know. Your
mommy, she was really worried about you.

192
00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:58,113
And if she could, she would tell you
that you can trust me.

193
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:07,386
Did your stepfather hurt your mommy?

194
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:09,054
Sean? Sean!

195
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:10,723
Okay. Okay, step back!

196
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:12,825
-I want my daughter!
-Get back!

197
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:15,429
All right! All right.

198
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,601
You don't have the right.

199
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,271
-I do--
-At a time like this, I need to see her.

200
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,506
No, you don't. I do have the right.

201
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:30,276
-She is my daughter.
-No, she is your stepdaughter.

202
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,444
And you know
how this whole thing works.

203
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,814
You done been through this a thousand
times. You hire your lawyers...

204
00:14:35,824 --> 00:14:40,924
...and you do your thing.
But right now, we're gonna do ours.

205
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:46,694
-I'm gonna take a walk. You deal with him.
-Yeah, I got it.

206
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:51,464
That was Dr. Sterling. Okay, bye-bye.

207
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,019
It's a hell of a thing.

208
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:17,862
-Yup.
-I heard her show once.

209
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:02,576
Erica?

210
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,871
Erica, can you hear me?

211
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,050
Erica?

212
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,547
You had the service?

213
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:15,914
They didn't know when
you were going to wake up...

214
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:18,644
...if you were going to wake up.

215
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:21,722
You were gone for three weeks.

216
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:25,389
We had to let him go. We had to.

217
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,526
I wanna see him again.

218
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:29,361
-He's gone.
-I wanna see him again!

219
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:31,703
He's gone, honey.

220
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:39,059
He would have been happy
that you lived.

221
00:16:51,827 --> 00:16:56,332
Nurse Bench, you have a call on one-four.
Nurse Bench.

222
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:03,729
I don't know. All the faces
are starting to blur together. I--

223
00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:05,664
I just can't tell anymore, you know?

224
00:17:05,674 --> 00:17:10,135
You gotta help us here. We need
something from you, anything.

225
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:12,238
Let's start over again.

226
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:17,599
He hit your boyfriend with the pipe.
Once, twice, three times?

227
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:20,312
We know how tough it can be...

228
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:23,297
-...to go back there--
-Do you, huh?

229
00:17:24,993 --> 00:17:28,520
Look, Miss Bain, we're on your side.

230
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:32,791
Yeah.

231
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,801
I know that.

232
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:37,537
You're the good guys.

233
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:42,171
So how come it doesn't feel like that?

234
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:08,533
Please leave a message for David and Erica
after the beep.

235
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:11,808
Hey, it's me. Call me at the gallery.

236
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,465
I'll take you out. Go to dinner, a movie.

237
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:19,011
Let's go for a walk. Anything, okay?

238
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:18,438
Ma'am, can I help you?

239
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:22,200
Detective O'Connor and Detective Pitney,
please.

240
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:26,638
Pitney and O'Connor are out.
Can anyone else help you?

241
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:28,573
Well...

242
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:31,076
...you know,
I wanted to check on my case.

243
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:33,879
I've been calling and
we've been playing phone tag...

244
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,314
-...and I thought that if I came down--
-Okay.

245
00:24:36,324 --> 00:24:38,959
What kind of case did you have?

246
00:24:41,296 --> 00:24:43,555
My boyfriend was beaten to death.

247
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:47,985
Oh, I'm sorry.
Do you have a complaint report number?

248
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,897
-No, I don't know it.
-And what was his name?

249
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,966
David Kirmani.

250
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:57,607
K-l-R-M-A-N-l.

251
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:01,412
It might be under Erica Bain.

252
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:07,112
About how long ago did it happen?

253
00:25:07,122 --> 00:25:09,122
June 1 1th.

254
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:13,285
Okay. I realize how difficult
this can be...

255
00:25:13,295 --> 00:25:16,354
...but if you'd please be patient
and have a seat over there...

256
00:25:16,364 --> 00:25:18,957
...an officer will be down shortly
to help you.

257
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:20,967
Okay.

258
00:25:43,158 --> 00:25:45,016
I realize how difficult it can be...

259
00:25:45,026 --> 00:25:48,086
...but if you'd please be patient
and have a seat over there...

260
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:52,006
...an officer will be down shortly
to help you.

261
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:20,218
-Wanna get something to eat?
-What's up, guys?

262
00:26:20,228 --> 00:26:22,087
-Hey.
-You saw the game last night?

263
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:24,097
Man.

264
00:26:35,577 --> 00:26:37,577
Could I help you?

265
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:42,641
Yeah. I wanna buy a gun.

266
00:26:42,817 --> 00:26:44,542
License?

267
00:26:44,552 --> 00:26:47,779
Oh, yeah, of course.
I need a license, yeah.

268
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:52,384
Once you get one, fill out this form,
and we'll notify you in 30 days.

269
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:54,219
I need to get something now.

270
00:26:54,229 --> 00:26:56,229
Sorry. That's illegal.

271
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,199
Hey!

272
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:02,900
I won't survive 30 days.

273
00:27:12,647 --> 00:27:14,339
Hey.

274
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:17,409
-What happened to you?
-Me? Nothing.

275
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:19,585
A thousand dollars.

276
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:22,314
A thousand dollars?

277
00:27:22,324 --> 00:27:24,749
Okay, but I need to learn how to use it.

278
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:27,751
No shit. Follow me.

279
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:53,453
Wait right here.

280
00:27:56,991 --> 00:27:58,991
In here.

281
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:04,789
It's a Kahr K9.
Check to see if it's loaded.

282
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,191
How do I do that?

283
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:09,170
The chamber. Pull the slide back.

284
00:28:09,337 --> 00:28:14,699
It's got internal safety so you don't
shoot yourself. Loads from the handle.

285
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,709
All right.

286
00:28:19,647 --> 00:28:21,942
You pay me now, it's yours.

287
00:28:25,987 --> 00:28:28,197
I'll throw in the bullets.

288
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:35,595
Yeah, I'll take it.

289
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:03,122
Got it, got it, got it.

290
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:32,543
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.

291
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,188
I don't care.

292
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,618
There's plenty of ways to die.

293
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,955
But you have to figure out a way to live.

294
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:47,696
Now, that's hard.

295
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,718
Look at you, all sophisticated.

296
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:15,573
-You shouldn't be working this late.
-I had a client dinner.

297
00:30:15,663 --> 00:30:17,989
Hey, can I get a dirty martini
for the lady?

298
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:20,804
You said this was business, Sean.

299
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,069
It is.

300
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:26,506
Eighty-six that.

301
00:30:28,476 --> 00:30:31,281
Okay, l--
I need a favor from you.

302
00:30:32,714 --> 00:30:34,714
You....

303
00:30:35,383 --> 00:30:39,511
-You heard about that Murrow thing, right?
-His wife killed herself.

304
00:30:39,521 --> 00:30:42,914
Oh, come on. Women don't
shoot themselves in the face.

305
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,256
At least in my experience.

306
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:50,193
Where do they shoot themselves,
in your experience?

307
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:55,001
The heart.

308
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:03,534
Jackie, I been...

309
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,906
...chasing after this asshole
for three straight years.

310
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:11,676
And right when his wife was ready
to turn state's evidence on him...

311
00:31:11,686 --> 00:31:16,714
...instead of blowing the lid off of him,
she blows off her own head.

312
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:19,699
-Come on.
-You don't let go, do you?

313
00:31:24,432 --> 00:31:26,432
So what can I do?

314
00:31:29,671 --> 00:31:33,107
Well, she has a daughter.
Had a daughter.

315
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:35,274
And...

316
00:31:35,843 --> 00:31:38,303
...her daughter knows something.

317
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,706
But now he's asked for custody of her
and then he's gonna get it.

318
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:44,342
-ls he the father?
-No, no. He's her stepfather.

319
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:46,711
-And you want her made a ward of court.
-Yes.

320
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:49,113
She knows something
and she's not safe with him.

321
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:53,284
Look, all I'm asking you to do
is just act on her behalf.

322
00:31:53,294 --> 00:31:55,294
Please.

323
00:31:58,232 --> 00:32:00,232
Sean, I'm your ex-wife.

324
00:32:00,635 --> 00:32:02,635
Conflict of interest.

325
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:06,276
And besides, I don't do pro bono.

326
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:12,378
You used to.

327
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,146
Yeah, well, I grew up.

328
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,041
When did you get out?!

329
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,744
-You won't let me see my kids?
-You can't be here! Court order!

330
00:32:52,754 --> 00:32:57,684
-I'm calling 911!
-If I can't see them, you won't see them!

331
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,928
Try seeing them now.

332
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,068
It's my money too.

333
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,020
I can hear you breathing.

334
00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:30,549
No.

335
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:54,125
-Squad central.
-Notify upon arrival.

336
00:35:54,135 --> 00:35:56,894
-Damn.
-We're a 10-84 at 110 and Lenox.

337
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:59,931
10-4. Eighty-five to patrol supervisor
on the scene.

338
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:03,766
-10-4.
-Looks like the circus made it to town.

339
00:36:34,242 --> 00:36:35,499
Any IDs?

340
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:39,844
Victim's a 30-year-old Vietnamese female.
Ida Combs.

341
00:36:40,915 --> 00:36:43,805
-Where's the other body?
-This way.

342
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:48,186
Got a 39-year-old, Sandy Combs.
White male.

343
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:52,650
Looks like he was a roadie for Aerosmith.
I don't think those guys have a dental plan.

344
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,952
Guy had a rap sheet longer than my dick.

345
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,624
So in other words, no priors.

346
00:36:58,232 --> 00:37:00,232
Easy.

347
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:06,998
So we got us a Sandy Combs and
an Ida Combs. What does that tell us?

348
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:10,268
They're married.
I'm way ahead of you, pal.

349
00:37:10,278 --> 00:37:14,372
-Yeah, that's one way of ending it.
-You know, what's wrong with divorce?

350
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:16,382
Everything.

351
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:18,878
Divorce sucks.

352
00:37:20,554 --> 00:37:22,013
Okay, so tell me.

353
00:37:22,023 --> 00:37:24,749
Well, she took three in the torso
with a.38.

354
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:29,720
Then somebody smoked him with a 9 mm
automatic. Don't ask me who, though.

355
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,062
And we found these casings.

356
00:37:34,101 --> 00:37:38,296
Three casings. Looks like there's
a partial print on one, but it's smudged.

357
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:39,830
Anybody check surveillance?

358
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,835
That monitor's working,
but the machine's empty.

359
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,521
Machine's working.

360
00:37:55,957 --> 00:37:58,847
-But where's the tape?
-Don't know.

361
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:05,790
And why didn't he take the money?

362
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,435
They chickened out, got scared?

363
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:15,171
We got three casings, only one hit.
How about that?

364
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:18,803
Maybe he's farsighted, crappy shooter.
Who knows?

365
00:38:18,813 --> 00:38:21,448
Or he never fired a gun before.

366
00:38:57,485 --> 00:38:59,410
It is...

367
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,718
...astonishing...

368
00:39:03,491 --> 00:39:05,959
...numbing, to find...

369
00:39:06,861 --> 00:39:10,176
...that inside you there is a stranger.

370
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:12,857
One that has your...

371
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:15,034
...arms...

372
00:39:15,703 --> 00:39:17,703
...your legs...

373
00:39:17,872 --> 00:39:19,872
...your eyes.

374
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:25,773
A sleepless, restless stranger...

375
00:39:27,481 --> 00:39:29,506
...who keeps walking...

376
00:39:30,518 --> 00:39:32,645
...keeps eating...

377
00:39:33,354 --> 00:39:35,179
...keeps...

378
00:39:35,189 --> 00:39:37,189
...Iiving.

379
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:46,755
New York, like any metropolis--

380
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:53,230
New York, like any metropolis,
is an organism that changes, mutates.

381
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:58,170
Building sprout-like chromosomes
on the DNA of its streets.

382
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:14,894
New York, like any metropolis...

383
00:40:15,062 --> 00:40:18,022
...is an organism that changes, mutates.

384
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:22,962
Building sprout-like chromosomes
on the DNA of its streets.

385
00:40:39,553 --> 00:40:43,681
Look, I've got-- I've got two shows
that are almost finished.

386
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:48,018
They're already mixed. All they need is an
intro and an outro, which I could do live.

387
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,987
I've got six shows in various stages.

388
00:40:49,997 --> 00:40:55,559
I've got all these stories in my files.
You know, new stuff, better stuff.

389
00:40:55,569 --> 00:40:59,130
And I know what I'm doing,
and you know that I know what I'm doing.

390
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:02,115
Erica. You've been through so much.

391
00:41:02,276 --> 00:41:04,869
You need more time before
you put yourself out there.

392
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,371
-Don't make me beg.
-I don't mean to.

393
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,608
But we have a public and I'm not sure
you're ready for it yet.

394
00:41:10,618 --> 00:41:13,210
You telling me I can't work
because of what happened?

395
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,552
I did not say that.

396
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,790
Look...

397
00:41:20,094 --> 00:41:22,644
...I just need to keep living.

398
00:41:22,696 --> 00:41:25,062
You know, I don't wanna....

399
00:41:25,799 --> 00:41:28,165
I don't wanna disappear.

400
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:41,605
--station WNKW,
located at 90.1 on the FM dial.

401
00:41:41,782 --> 00:41:43,943
Up next is Street Walk.

402
00:41:44,118 --> 00:41:47,478
Let's now join Erica Bain
in our WNKW studios.

403
00:41:47,488 --> 00:41:50,855
Okay, Erica.
Three, two, one, you're on.

404
00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:54,425
This is Erica Bain, and I walk the city.

405
00:41:55,196 --> 00:41:57,196
New York...

406
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:01,432
...Iike any metropolis, is an organism....

407
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,411
Okay. Is there anything we can cut to?

408
00:42:20,421 --> 00:42:22,313
Music, prerecord, anything?

409
00:42:22,323 --> 00:42:24,363
Give me a minute, Carol.

410
00:42:24,658 --> 00:42:26,658
New York...

411
00:42:27,528 --> 00:42:29,962
...Iike any metropolis...

412
00:42:31,732 --> 00:42:33,732
...is....

413
00:42:44,245 --> 00:42:46,475
Oh, shit.

414
00:42:49,883 --> 00:42:51,908
New York...

415
00:42:53,354 --> 00:42:56,414
...the safest big city in the world.

416
00:42:58,692 --> 00:43:01,354
But it is horrible...

417
00:43:01,729 --> 00:43:04,789
...to fear the place you once loved.

418
00:43:06,066 --> 00:43:09,891
And to see a street corner
you knew so well...

419
00:43:10,104 --> 00:43:12,739
...and be afraid of its shadow.

420
00:43:13,307 --> 00:43:17,217
To see familiar steps,
be unable to climb them.

421
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:22,005
I never understood
how people lived with fear.

422
00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:26,007
Women afraid to walk home alone...

423
00:43:26,053 --> 00:43:28,283
...people afraid of...

424
00:43:28,555 --> 00:43:30,714
...white powder in their mailbox...

425
00:43:30,724 --> 00:43:34,251
...darkness and night.

426
00:43:34,928 --> 00:43:38,227
People afraid of people.

427
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:44,020
I always believed that fear
belonged to other people.

428
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:46,671
Weaker people.

429
00:43:48,976 --> 00:43:51,171
It never touched me.

430
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,143
And then it did.

431
00:44:01,655 --> 00:44:04,448
And when it touches you, you know...

432
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:07,484
...that it's been there all along...

433
00:44:07,494 --> 00:44:12,193
...waiting beneath the surfaces
of everything you loved.

434
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:16,626
And your skin crawls...

435
00:44:17,871 --> 00:44:19,630
...and your heart sickens...

436
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:25,590
...and you look at the person you once were
walking down that street...

437
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:30,750
...and you wonder, will you...?

438
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,879
Will you ever be her again?

439
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,129
Talk to me.

440
00:45:47,528 --> 00:45:50,320
Look at this motherfucker right here.

441
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,815
Hey, what sounds
you got up in there, dog?

442
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:57,561
This motherfucker
think I'm playing, man.

443
00:45:57,571 --> 00:46:01,498
Don't nobody talk in New York no more?
I asked you a motherfucking question!

444
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:04,201
I said, what are you listening to,
you fucking faggot?!

445
00:46:04,211 --> 00:46:05,969
-Radiohead, man.
-Radiohead?

446
00:46:05,979 --> 00:46:07,979
Leave him alone, man!

447
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,873
Man, shut the fuck up!

448
00:46:09,883 --> 00:46:12,309
Little man, you ain't know
your pop sucked dick?

449
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,913
He's good at it too. Now, you wanna
grow up to be like that punk ass?

450
00:46:15,923 --> 00:46:17,915
That's a nice watch.
How old are you?

451
00:46:17,925 --> 00:46:20,918
-Get your ass out of here.
-Tell your mom I said "What's up? "

452
00:46:20,928 --> 00:46:23,921
Yo, little man, holler at me,
I'll show you how to be a G.

453
00:46:23,931 --> 00:46:26,821
Hey, yo, thanks for the iPod, man.

454
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:30,627
This shit is nice, man.
This is all me right here.

455
00:46:30,637 --> 00:46:33,197
-I'm keeping this joint.
-You kidding me, right?

456
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,207
This is cool.

457
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:40,604
Oh, shit.

458
00:46:40,614 --> 00:46:45,459
-Yo, yo, yo, I got this, I got this.
-Bitch, is you crazy?

459
00:46:49,656 --> 00:46:51,656
This is too easy, man.

460
00:46:58,165 --> 00:47:00,165
So...

461
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:05,717
...you gonna give me some Radiohead
too?

462
00:47:12,646 --> 00:47:15,366
You ever been fucked by a knife?

463
00:48:01,895 --> 00:48:04,621
I should have walked out of that train.

464
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:10,241
I could've just shown them the gun,
and they wouldn't have hurt me.

465
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:15,235
Why don't my hands shake?

466
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,611
Why doesn't somebody stop me?

467
00:48:26,353 --> 00:48:28,446
I swear they like Oreos.

468
00:48:28,622 --> 00:48:30,213
Homicide, this is Vitale.

469
00:48:30,223 --> 00:48:32,816
There you go,
you're doing the tricks again.

470
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:36,553
Upside down. No, come on up.
Gotta come to the top. There you go, baby.

471
00:48:36,563 --> 00:48:38,563
Okay, thank you.

472
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:41,358
We've got two confirmed shot
on a subway from Brooklyn.

473
00:48:41,368 --> 00:48:44,828
Church Street, lower Manhattan.
Everyone's arguing whose jurisdiction.

474
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:49,003
-That makes it ours.
-All right, fellas, let's go.

475
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:34,678
We got two dead bodies inside
the subway car, and no eyewitnesses.

476
00:49:34,688 --> 00:49:36,980
Of course not.
Did you check with BCI?

477
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:38,382
Yeah, I got this printout.

478
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,050
-They here yet?
-Yes, sir.

479
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,715
-And I'll get them to you.
-Morning, fellas.

480
00:49:45,132 --> 00:49:47,396
Christ on a cracker.

481
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:51,732
Well, I hope this is their stop.

482
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,438
Got Radiohead, U2, Dixie Chicks.

483
00:49:57,611 --> 00:50:00,926
-No Wu-Tang?
-I don't think this is his.

484
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:08,186
Money in his pocket.

485
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:21,029
Looks like a 9 mm automatic.

486
00:50:22,736 --> 00:50:25,541
-Like from the other night?
-Yeah.

487
00:50:27,074 --> 00:50:31,324
Check it against Brass Catchers,
see if it matches.

488
00:50:43,256 --> 00:50:45,256
Hey, you.

489
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:51,054
--just go inside. I came out here for
a smoke. I just wanna go back in.

490
00:50:51,064 --> 00:50:55,399
You're giving me a hard time.
You let my friends in.

491
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:12,275
They both had cash, so neither one of them
was robbed. And they had priors.

492
00:51:12,285 --> 00:51:14,285
A shitload of them.

493
00:51:15,088 --> 00:51:17,814
The guy at Sandy's, he had priors.

494
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,750
I know, but that was domestic.

495
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,160
No, but he wasn't robbed.

496
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:25,430
Or something.

497
00:51:25,465 --> 00:51:29,205
-I mean, what are we missing?
-I wish I knew.

498
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,963
Now, look. You got a small guy sitting.

499
00:51:32,973 --> 00:51:35,866
These two punks come at him with a knife
and, you know...

500
00:51:35,876 --> 00:51:38,735
...he shoots the first one without
getting out of his seat.

501
00:51:38,745 --> 00:51:40,437
Right. Go on, I'm with you.

502
00:51:40,447 --> 00:51:44,608
It's like maybe Mr. Average Joe just
decided, "I'm not gonna take it anymore.

503
00:51:44,618 --> 00:51:46,977
And I'm gonna take matters
into my own hands."

504
00:51:46,987 --> 00:51:49,246
The kind of guy
you wouldn't even notice.

505
00:51:49,256 --> 00:51:52,349
Well, if that's true, he's getting better.

506
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:55,123
Yeah. Every bullet hit home.

507
00:52:06,072 --> 00:52:07,564
-Detective!
-Hey, detective!

508
00:52:07,574 --> 00:52:11,203
-Detective!
-Any leads, detective? Please.

509
00:52:12,312 --> 00:52:15,839
-Come on, step back!
-What about the bodies, detective?

510
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:18,542
It's a new-- It's a new investigation.

511
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,278
We haven't talked to anybody yet, no.

512
00:52:21,288 --> 00:52:23,146
It's a brand-new investigation.

513
00:52:23,156 --> 00:52:28,001
-Any suspects?
-No, we're not-- I'm sorry, but we're not--

514
00:52:28,028 --> 00:52:30,028
Any leads? How many?

515
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:32,130
Detective!

516
00:52:32,465 --> 00:52:34,224
Hey.

517
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,193
Excuse me, don't I know you?

518
00:52:36,203 --> 00:52:38,995
-No, I don't think we've met.
-Wait a minute. I know you.

519
00:52:39,005 --> 00:52:41,064
-No. You haven't. I--
-What's your name?

520
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,900
My name's Erica Bain.
I do a radio show.

521
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:47,504
I don't know if you'd be interested in doing
an interview. I'd love to--

522
00:52:47,514 --> 00:52:49,873
I'm sorry.
We're not talking to the media now.

523
00:52:49,883 --> 00:52:52,576
I'm not that kind of media.
It would be about you.

524
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:55,221
My life's not that interesting.

525
00:52:55,522 --> 00:52:59,347
-Yeah, but the work you do is.
-No, thank you.

526
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,105
So...

527
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,923
...you gonna give me some Radiohead
too?

528
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:25,880
You ever been fucked by a knife?

529
00:53:38,698 --> 00:53:40,724
How the hell did this get out so quick?

530
00:53:40,734 --> 00:53:45,962
Who knows? Coroner hates you,
people fucking technicians. Who knows?

531
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,972
"Bloodbath."

532
00:53:49,175 --> 00:53:51,473
You ever listen to NKW?

533
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:54,365
-What is that, like hip-hop?
-No.

534
00:53:55,248 --> 00:53:57,540
Remember a couple of months ago...

535
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:00,977
...this girl and her boyfriend,
they got jacked in Central Park?

536
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:04,848
-No. Which ones?
-Well, anyway, she has this radio show.

537
00:54:04,858 --> 00:54:07,918
-Right.
-She shows up at the subway last night...

538
00:54:07,928 --> 00:54:11,488
-...and guess who she wants to interview?
-Me?

539
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:15,558
What, you? You should totally do it.
Remember that Bernie Goetz thing?

540
00:54:15,568 --> 00:54:16,760
Hey, is Carter in?

541
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:19,663
Reporters calling in the night.
Reporters eat that shit up.

542
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:23,400
No, well, she's not that kind of reporter.
Yeah, well, have him call me.

543
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:25,268
What is she?
Like a DJ or something?

544
00:54:25,278 --> 00:54:27,938
-No, she's just interesting, you know.
-Interesting?

545
00:54:27,948 --> 00:54:30,006
Have him call me at my desk.
It's Mercer.

546
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,375
What's she want with you?
Give her my number.

547
00:54:32,385 --> 00:54:34,945
What's her precise street address?

548
00:54:34,955 --> 00:54:36,513
You know what I want?

549
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,848
I want everyone in the market
that night...

550
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:42,819
...everyone on the subway, outside.
Everybody, I need them all brought in.

551
00:54:42,829 --> 00:54:45,322
Somebody has to have seen this guy.

552
00:54:45,332 --> 00:54:48,358
I need you to get the registration
off of this iPod.

553
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:51,258
-See who it belongs to.
-I'm on it.

554
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,400
You've been avoiding me.

555
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,069
-No, I haven't.
-Yeah.

556
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:02,672
You've been avoiding
the full glare of my disapproval.

557
00:55:02,682 --> 00:55:07,344
Yeah, well, it was-- The show sucked
and everybody hated it. I'm sorry.

558
00:55:07,354 --> 00:55:10,880
Well, we don't normally do silence
on WNKW.

559
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,183
You almost managed a full minute.

560
00:55:13,193 --> 00:55:15,552
Well, I think I did
an okay recovery, so....

561
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:20,917
You got 11 more steps, do you?
Are they all gonna be on the air?

562
00:55:23,603 --> 00:55:28,336
I thought we were better than
some AM confessional...

563
00:55:28,508 --> 00:55:30,767
...but people are responding.

564
00:55:30,777 --> 00:55:35,367
I was wrong.
I'm big enough to admit it, so keep it up.

565
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,605
Erica Bain?

566
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:04,042
Erica Bain.

567
00:56:04,711 --> 00:56:07,043
I'm Detective Mercer. You--

568
00:56:09,315 --> 00:56:12,035
You remember me from last night?

569
00:56:13,486 --> 00:56:15,784
-Yeah.
-Yeah, well...

570
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:20,191
...I saw you in the hospital after....

571
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:24,725
After what had happened
to you and to your friend.

572
00:56:25,698 --> 00:56:26,956
My friend?

573
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:30,960
Yeah. I stopped by your room, you know,
because I recognized your name.

574
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:35,432
My wife, she used to listen to your show
all the time and...

575
00:56:35,442 --> 00:56:39,310
...that was why I stopped you
in the subway.

576
00:56:39,546 --> 00:56:42,181
I just wanted you to know that.

577
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,650
Thank you.

578
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,916
You know, it was disturbing.

579
00:56:53,059 --> 00:56:56,204
It really was. I mean, you were gone.

580
00:56:57,263 --> 00:57:00,323
And to see somebody...

581
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,158
...that can't see you, it....

582
00:57:04,037 --> 00:57:06,037
But you're back now.

583
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,206
Yeah, I'm back now.

584
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:12,350
A lot of people don't make it back.

585
00:57:13,113 --> 00:57:15,113
I know that.

586
00:57:15,782 --> 00:57:19,149
I know you do. You see...

587
00:57:19,819 --> 00:57:21,344
...I checked into your case.

588
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:24,653
-You checked into my case?
-Yeah.

589
00:57:25,058 --> 00:57:28,718
We got two of the best detectives
in this city that's working on this...

590
00:57:28,728 --> 00:57:30,923
...and we will find them.

591
00:57:31,097 --> 00:57:33,097
We always do.

592
00:57:34,634 --> 00:57:37,535
Are policemen always so confident?

593
00:57:38,638 --> 00:57:41,018
Are you interviewing me now?

594
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,809
-Yeah, I guess I am.
-Right.

595
00:57:45,745 --> 00:57:47,745
Okay.

596
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:50,374
How long is this gonna take?

597
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:54,281
Five minutes, tops.
We can do it over here.

598
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,890
Yeah.

599
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,205
When you first go to a crime scene...

600
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:07,730
-...what do you look for?
-Evidence.

601
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,193
Okay, such as?

602
00:58:10,203 --> 00:58:12,328
Murder weapon, entry wound...

603
00:58:12,338 --> 00:58:16,001
...DNA samples, prints,
carbon fragments...

604
00:58:16,176 --> 00:58:18,134
...position of the corpse.

605
00:58:18,144 --> 00:58:21,437
It's amazing what a dead body
can tell you.

606
00:58:21,447 --> 00:58:23,406
So the dead do talk?

607
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,816
Oh, yeah. Everybody talks.

608
00:58:25,985 --> 00:58:30,354
Now, most everybody lies.
But the dead can't.

609
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:35,084
And then again, the lies
tell you things too, because...

610
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,899
...people tell them for a reason.

611
00:58:38,064 --> 00:58:42,625
And those bodies at the subway,
what are they telling you?

612
00:58:42,635 --> 00:58:44,635
You read the paper.

613
00:58:44,871 --> 00:58:47,336
Should I believe what I read?

614
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:54,473
You ever read about him?

615
00:58:57,217 --> 00:58:58,675
Why do I know him?

616
00:58:58,685 --> 00:59:03,012
That's Mr. Murrow. He owns the parking
out on Roosevelt Island.

617
00:59:03,022 --> 00:59:05,317
But that's not all he does.

618
00:59:05,592 --> 00:59:07,592
What else does he do?

619
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,091
-You really wanna know?
-Yeah.

620
00:59:13,433 --> 00:59:15,813
Then this is off the record.

621
00:59:16,069 --> 00:59:18,069
Okay.

622
00:59:22,008 --> 00:59:26,428
He imports drugs, guns, people.
Whatever's in demand.

623
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:28,571
Found three guys that had crossed him...

624
00:59:28,581 --> 00:59:33,042
...with their hands Superglued to a table
and expanding cement in their throats.

625
00:59:33,052 --> 00:59:35,278
Had his wife ready
to testify against him...

626
00:59:35,288 --> 00:59:38,548
...and then she's found with her brains
blown out, gun in her hand.

627
00:59:38,558 --> 00:59:40,850
Nothing adds up except his lawyers.

628
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:43,052
Now he's got custody
of his stepdaughter...

629
00:59:43,062 --> 00:59:45,555
...and not for sentimental reasons.

630
00:59:45,565 --> 00:59:48,157
But he knows she knows something...

631
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:51,894
...and I hate to think what's
gonna happen to her. But...

632
00:59:51,904 --> 00:59:54,539
...maybe you know a nicer side.

633
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:01,140
And why can't you nail him?

634
01:00:02,248 --> 01:00:04,373
Because I follow the law.

635
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:07,110
Well, there's nothing you can do?

636
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,120
Nothing that's legal.

637
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,858
I didn't say that.

638
01:00:14,127 --> 01:00:16,127
I didn't hear it.

639
01:00:21,234 --> 01:00:22,592
Thank you.

640
01:00:22,602 --> 01:00:24,602
Nothing that's legal.

641
01:00:28,441 --> 01:00:29,899
So...

642
01:00:29,909 --> 01:00:32,459
...there's nothing you can do?

643
01:00:32,812 --> 01:00:36,213
No. No matter how bad I feel about it.

644
01:00:36,849 --> 01:00:40,243
I petitioned that she be made
a ward of the court...

645
01:00:40,253 --> 01:00:44,673
...but his lawyers killed that one
stone dead, so....

646
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,559
Ever shot anyone?

647
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,897
Yeah.

648
01:00:53,433 --> 01:00:55,433
Did your hands shake?

649
01:00:58,271 --> 01:01:00,271
No.

650
01:01:00,506 --> 01:01:04,467
But that's one of the benefits
of being on the right side.

651
01:01:04,477 --> 01:01:10,211
A benefit that that asshole and
the subway shooter don't have.

652
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:13,285
And you think they're the same?

653
01:01:14,053 --> 01:01:18,133
They both walked away from a murder,
didn't they?

654
01:01:18,558 --> 01:01:20,768
Let me ask you a question.

655
01:01:21,027 --> 01:01:23,027
Just us.

656
01:01:26,032 --> 01:01:28,091
How did you...

657
01:01:30,136 --> 01:01:34,471
...pull it back together
after what happened to you?

658
01:01:36,042 --> 01:01:38,042
You don't.

659
01:01:38,478 --> 01:01:40,269
I'm sorry.

660
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:42,004
-No, no.
-Jacked-up question, man.

661
01:01:42,014 --> 01:01:44,608
It's a fair question. You....

662
01:01:47,053 --> 01:01:49,093
You become someone else.

663
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,760
A stranger.

664
01:02:03,569 --> 01:02:06,329
You must have loved him very much.

665
01:02:06,339 --> 01:02:08,339
Yeah.

666
01:02:09,776 --> 01:02:15,811
Sometimes that just makes it harder,
you know. You just wish you didn't.

667
01:02:16,582 --> 01:02:20,211
So, come on, some more cop stuff.

668
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:23,546
-Or are we done?
-No, l-- We're good.

669
01:02:24,924 --> 01:02:26,749
Thanks.

670
01:02:26,759 --> 01:02:29,887
And...here.

671
01:02:30,062 --> 01:02:32,121
That's my card. You--

672
01:02:32,465 --> 01:02:37,160
You wanna talk about your case,
you can call me. Any time.

673
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,128
I warn you...

674
01:02:39,138 --> 01:02:41,138
...I don't sleep.

675
01:02:42,775 --> 01:02:44,775
Neither do l.

676
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:13,790
I walk the streets at night now.

677
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:18,143
I find places and things
I never knew existed.

678
01:03:18,478 --> 01:03:23,040
But am I finding them
or are they finding me?

679
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:28,886
Ever shot anyone?

680
01:03:29,455 --> 01:03:31,414
Yes.

681
01:03:31,424 --> 01:03:33,551
Did your hands shake?

682
01:03:35,962 --> 01:03:41,423
No, that's one of the benefits
of being on the right side.

683
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:46,762
That from a police detective covering
last night's subway shooting.

684
01:03:46,772 --> 01:03:50,852
And like all good cops,
he believes in the law...

685
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:56,180
...in right and wrong,
and the thin, fragile line between them.

686
01:03:57,283 --> 01:04:00,768
And he's probably wondering,
as I speak...

687
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:04,987
...why is somebody
doing his job for him?

688
01:04:17,036 --> 01:04:19,036
Hey, baby.

689
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:23,436
-Hello.
-What's up, honey?

690
01:04:23,643 --> 01:04:25,368
Not much.

691
01:04:25,378 --> 01:04:28,711
So, what would 50 dollars do for you?

692
01:04:31,717 --> 01:04:34,410
-Shouldn't she be at home?
-She got no home.

693
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:36,420
Have you, honey?

694
01:04:39,325 --> 01:04:42,419
-Where to?
-Come on in.

695
01:04:45,765 --> 01:04:50,355
-You're looking for a show in the back seat?
-Oh, yeah.

696
01:04:55,675 --> 01:04:57,715
What's your name, honey?

697
01:04:59,345 --> 01:05:01,345
Chloe.

698
01:05:01,714 --> 01:05:04,547
What's he got in mind, Chloe?

699
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:08,119
The little whore needs a mommy.

700
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,180
Are you a mommy?

701
01:05:12,692 --> 01:05:14,785
You're a whore, right?

702
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:16,994
I'm collecting whores.

703
01:05:17,129 --> 01:05:19,388
You know them suicide bombers
over in Iraq?

704
01:05:19,398 --> 01:05:22,858
When they die they want 72 virgins.
Me, I want whores.

705
01:05:22,868 --> 01:05:24,460
I want them while I'm alive.

706
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:28,720
You know, Chloe and l
are gonna take a little walk.

707
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:35,747
-You ain't going nowhere.
-Never get in the car.

708
01:05:36,782 --> 01:05:39,247
How long have you been in it?

709
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:41,719
Four...

710
01:05:42,788 --> 01:05:46,315
...five, six days.

711
01:05:46,659 --> 01:05:48,659
Since....

712
01:05:49,428 --> 01:05:51,726
Since Vegas.

713
01:05:52,999 --> 01:05:56,127
But you wanna go now, don't you?

714
01:05:57,003 --> 01:05:58,561
Yes.

715
01:05:58,571 --> 01:06:01,404
Are you giving me grief again?

716
01:06:01,574 --> 01:06:04,566
Oh, my, got us a supercunt here.

717
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:07,005
Open the doors.

718
01:06:07,313 --> 01:06:09,071
And if I don't?

719
01:06:09,081 --> 01:06:13,076
Then I'll be the last supercunt
you'll ever see.

720
01:06:14,987 --> 01:06:17,146
Get out of the car, Chloe. Go on.

721
01:06:17,156 --> 01:06:19,156
Not until he pays me.

722
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:21,432
All right, pay the girl.

723
01:06:21,861 --> 01:06:24,762
Come on! Easy.

724
01:06:31,303 --> 01:06:33,303
All of it.

725
01:06:35,474 --> 01:06:37,474
All of it!

726
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:53,390
Come on, walk.

727
01:06:53,492 --> 01:06:57,121
Don't turn around. Just keep going.

728
01:06:58,364 --> 01:07:01,691
You got a family back there, Chloe,
in Vegas?

729
01:07:01,701 --> 01:07:04,829
No. I went there from Albuquerque.

730
01:07:05,004 --> 01:07:08,914
Well, you got enough money
to get you home now.

731
01:07:11,811 --> 01:07:13,811
Ain't you a sad whore?

732
01:07:13,846 --> 01:07:15,846
Get out of the way!

733
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:29,919
Hey. Hey!

734
01:07:29,929 --> 01:07:32,819
You're okay. You're okay, come on.

735
01:07:33,099 --> 01:07:35,124
Let me turn you over.

736
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:39,032
All right. I'm so sorry. Here.

737
01:07:41,907 --> 01:07:43,903
Is this...

738
01:07:43,913 --> 01:07:45,468
...still America?

739
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,605
Yeah. Your leg is broken.

740
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:52,447
Who the hell are you?

741
01:07:53,185 --> 01:07:55,185
I'm nobody.

742
01:08:03,529 --> 01:08:05,654
There is no going back...

743
01:08:05,798 --> 01:08:07,798
...to that other.

744
01:08:07,933 --> 01:08:09,933
She is gone.

745
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:13,900
This thing, this stranger...

746
01:08:14,273 --> 01:08:16,468
...it's all you are now.

747
01:08:22,948 --> 01:08:25,040
You walking out the heat?

748
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:27,050
Yeah.

749
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,620
Are you all right?

750
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:32,150
Your hands are cold as ice.

751
01:08:33,959 --> 01:08:36,621
Your lipstick is smudged.

752
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,664
Erica. Erica!

753
01:08:46,472 --> 01:08:48,664
You never said my name before.

754
01:08:48,674 --> 01:08:50,533
I heard your show.

755
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,568
Right and wrong?

756
01:08:57,216 --> 01:09:00,042
Ballistic tests have linked
last night's shooting...

757
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:03,779
...with the shooting from the market
and the shooting from the subway, so....

758
01:09:03,789 --> 01:09:07,683
Are you saying--? Are you saying the
same gun was used in all three shootings?

759
01:09:07,693 --> 01:09:09,618
Well, that seems to be the case.

760
01:09:09,628 --> 01:09:10,986
Detective.

761
01:09:10,996 --> 01:09:14,023
Sources are saying the witness
can provide a description...

762
01:09:14,033 --> 01:09:17,226
-...but has refused to talk.
-I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

763
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:21,316
Has the witness refused
to provide a description?

764
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:24,503
No, the witness is awake...

765
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:29,932
...and she is coherent, and we will be
interviewing her shortly.

766
01:09:30,783 --> 01:09:34,009
Now, thank you, that's everything.
Chief.

767
01:09:34,019 --> 01:09:35,778
Please, everybody, please.

768
01:09:35,788 --> 01:09:38,747
That's all the information
we're prepared to release.

769
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,757
Thank you very much.

770
01:09:47,299 --> 01:09:49,299
Hey.

771
01:09:49,969 --> 01:09:53,762
-You handled yourself really well back there.
-I tried.

772
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:57,566
So, what, is this guy
becoming an obsession with you?

773
01:09:57,576 --> 01:10:00,136
No, my interest is in you.

774
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,080
Why me?

775
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:08,640
Well, because you seem like a good man,
you know? Like a good cop.

776
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:12,681
Yeah, well, ain't nobody
doing my job for me.

777
01:10:12,691 --> 01:10:14,650
You heard my show.

778
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,318
Yeah.

779
01:10:16,328 --> 01:10:19,255
You gotta think every one of those
reporters in that room...

780
01:10:19,265 --> 01:10:21,985
...is gonna sensationalize this.

781
01:10:22,434 --> 01:10:24,126
But not you.

782
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:26,176
You're better than that.

783
01:10:27,907 --> 01:10:29,907
How can you tell?

784
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:32,801
Your show.

785
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:35,644
-My show?
-Yeah.

786
01:10:36,448 --> 01:10:38,643
You see, my wife...

787
01:10:38,851 --> 01:10:41,210
-...she didn't listen to it.
-No?

788
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:43,220
I did.

789
01:10:44,957 --> 01:10:47,516
Well, you don't fit our audience profile.

790
01:10:47,526 --> 01:10:51,320
-Yeah, and you don't fit your voice either.
-I don't?

791
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:56,175
No, you're a whole lot cuter
and about 100 pounds lighter.

792
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:01,838
How's the girl doing?

793
01:11:02,908 --> 01:11:07,838
She's pretty banged up.
Yeah, but we'll know more tomorrow.

794
01:11:08,314 --> 01:11:10,314
Well....

795
01:11:11,717 --> 01:11:13,742
I hope she's all right.

796
01:11:13,986 --> 01:11:15,986
Yeah.

797
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:29,366
-Hi.
-Hey.

798
01:11:30,803 --> 01:11:32,928
You see those pictures
of the subway thing?

799
01:11:32,938 --> 01:11:34,997
-Gross.
-They shot another one last night.

800
01:11:35,007 --> 01:11:37,967
-Some pervert.
-Who will they go for next, Donald Trump?

801
01:11:37,977 --> 01:11:40,602
-No, that's incitement.
-And justified.

802
01:11:40,612 --> 01:11:43,505
-Wish he'd take care of my ex.
-You think that's funny?

803
01:11:43,515 --> 01:11:46,275
I suppose you think
lethal injection's funny too.

804
01:11:46,285 --> 01:11:49,578
-Funny like strange, or funny "ha, ha"?
-You're sick, you know that?

805
01:11:49,588 --> 01:11:51,588
You're all sick.

806
01:11:58,597 --> 01:12:03,058
I'm thinking about opening up your show.
I want you to take phone-ins.

807
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:06,162
-On what?
-You heard them.

808
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:09,732
You mean the shootings?
The vigilante thing?

809
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:13,102
-You really think that that's appropriate?
-Why not?

810
01:12:13,112 --> 01:12:16,305
Well, I thought you said
you didn't like that kind of thing.

811
01:12:16,315 --> 01:12:19,409
I don't. But you're good at it.

812
01:12:19,718 --> 01:12:23,245
-How am I good at it?
-You're a survivor.

813
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:26,448
-I'm not asking you to personalize it.
-Oh, you're not?

814
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:29,008
No more than you already have.

815
01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:33,544
"The essential American soul is hard...

816
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:37,463
...isolate, stoic, and a killer.

817
01:12:37,636 --> 01:12:39,934
It has never yet melted."

818
01:12:40,406 --> 01:12:42,531
I quote that from D.H. Lawrence...

819
01:12:42,541 --> 01:12:46,101
...because someone
is playing God out there...

820
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:49,271
...killing in the name of justice,
in this...

821
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:52,107
...the safest big city in the world.

822
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:57,146
And because I've been asked today to do
something that we've never done before:

823
01:12:57,156 --> 01:12:59,448
Take calls from our listeners
on the subject.

824
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:02,384
This is a new departure for us but
we wanna hear from you...

825
01:13:02,394 --> 01:13:07,730
...so call 212-165-9990.

826
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:10,893
First caller. Hi, you're on the air.

827
01:13:10,903 --> 01:13:14,029
As far as I'm concerned,
he's doing us a favor.

828
01:13:14,039 --> 01:13:15,230
And why is that?

829
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,399
Because no matter what
the media tells us...

830
01:13:17,409 --> 01:13:20,135
...crimes are being committed,
and he's cleaning it up.

831
01:13:20,145 --> 01:13:22,237
And you think
he has the right to do that.

832
01:13:22,247 --> 01:13:24,907
-Well, yeah.
-Next caller. You're on the air.

833
01:13:24,917 --> 01:13:26,942
You're talking about murder.

834
01:13:26,952 --> 01:13:28,911
The death penalty without a trial.

835
01:13:28,921 --> 01:13:32,514
The vigilante is just like the people
he's killing. He should be in jail.

836
01:13:32,524 --> 01:13:35,551
Well, maybe he will. Next caller.
You're on the air.

837
01:13:35,561 --> 01:13:38,387
It's less about what he's doing
than how it makes us feel.

838
01:13:38,397 --> 01:13:39,955
There's not a person I know...

839
01:13:39,965 --> 01:13:42,391
...doesn't get a jolt of
pleasure when they hear--

840
01:13:42,401 --> 01:13:44,893
-Pleasure?
- Yeah, revenge makes us feel good.

841
01:13:44,903 --> 01:13:47,329
That's why we have war,
why we got the death--

842
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:50,666
-Next caller, you 're on the air.
-I think it's good for New York.

843
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:53,168
I mean, this city
was turning into Disneyland.

844
01:13:53,178 --> 01:13:56,638
-We're getting our street cred back.
-Next caller. You 're on the air.

845
01:13:56,648 --> 01:14:00,909
What is wrong with our society, that this
kind of thing can even get on radio?

846
01:14:00,919 --> 01:14:03,979
Revenge, murder, vigilante killings?

847
01:14:04,089 --> 01:14:07,049
Hasn't the whole Iraqi debacle
taught us anything?

848
01:14:07,059 --> 01:14:08,917
"Waste the bad guys, bring them on."

849
01:14:08,927 --> 01:14:11,653
I've been a fan of yours.
I can't even believe you 're--

850
01:14:11,663 --> 01:14:13,555
Neither can l. You ' re on the air.

851
01:14:13,565 --> 01:14:17,493
I wonder if the vigilante has a girlfriend
because there's something sexy about--

852
01:14:17,503 --> 01:14:19,428
-Sexy?
- Yeah, completely.

853
01:14:19,438 --> 01:14:22,030
And if he 's listening, my number is 2--

854
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,867
-You ' re on the line.
-This is the vigilante calling.

855
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:30,062
I'm the man that takes care of business.
That chick can have--

856
01:14:37,289 --> 01:14:41,416
-I need to talk to someone.
-Ma'am, can I help you?

857
01:14:41,426 --> 01:14:43,426
Yeah.

858
01:14:44,796 --> 01:14:46,922
I need to talk to someone
about a homicide.

859
01:14:46,932 --> 01:14:48,932
Names?

860
01:14:50,068 --> 01:14:52,068
Erica Bain.

861
01:14:52,104 --> 01:14:54,104
She was the victim?

862
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:58,968
No. She wasn't the victim.

863
01:15:00,379 --> 01:15:02,379
She was the....

864
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:06,485
-She's....
-No "Erica Bain" under homicide.

865
01:15:07,352 --> 01:15:11,602
-Well, maybe there should be. You know?
-Pardon me?

866
01:15:14,393 --> 01:15:16,393
Nothing.

867
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:21,123
You gonna give me
some Radiohead too?

868
01:15:21,133 --> 01:15:22,591
Fucking woman!

869
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:26,594
Are you a mommy?
You're a whore, right?

870
01:15:29,408 --> 01:15:31,408
Erica?

871
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,946
Is that you?

872
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:40,842
-Because I could not stop for Death...
-Erica?

873
01:15:40,852 --> 01:15:43,111
...he kindly stopped for me.

874
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:44,446
Erica?

875
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:48,083
The carriage held but just ourselves.
And Immortality.

876
01:15:48,093 --> 01:15:50,093
Erica?

877
01:16:05,611 --> 01:16:07,302
Mercer.

878
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:09,312
Hey, it's me, Erica.

879
01:16:11,183 --> 01:16:13,183
I know.

880
01:16:13,218 --> 01:16:16,023
-ls everything okay?
- Yeah, l....

881
01:16:17,389 --> 01:16:22,744
I just wanted to talk and l--
For some reason, I thought of you.

882
01:16:23,462 --> 01:16:25,462
Okay.

883
01:16:26,298 --> 01:16:28,298
What's going on?

884
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:31,894
What do you do when you can't sleep?

885
01:16:34,336 --> 01:16:36,546
-Nothing.
-Isn't that hard?

886
01:16:37,072 --> 01:16:39,072
To do nothing?

887
01:16:39,841 --> 01:16:42,646
Well, you sort of get used to it.

888
01:16:52,154 --> 01:16:54,012
Erica?

889
01:16:54,022 --> 01:16:56,248
Well, come on, what's happening?
Talk to me.

890
01:16:56,258 --> 01:17:00,352
Did you sleep better
when your wife was beside you?

891
01:17:00,362 --> 01:17:02,362
I know I did.

892
01:17:03,165 --> 01:17:08,435
I couldn't feel my body unless his arms
were wrapped around me.

893
01:17:08,837 --> 01:17:11,812
Yeah, well, my wife, she used to...

894
01:17:12,507 --> 01:17:14,717
...flip through the night.

895
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:18,043
So I called her a mackerel.

896
01:17:19,781 --> 01:17:24,543
I guess that's not the worst thing
in the world to wake up to.

897
01:17:24,553 --> 01:17:28,246
Hey, you want me to stay on the phone
with you until you go to sleep?

898
01:17:28,256 --> 01:17:30,256
No.

899
01:17:31,026 --> 01:17:33,026
You've been good to me.

900
01:17:34,329 --> 01:17:36,329
Sleep tight.

901
01:17:50,278 --> 01:17:52,278
Yeah.

902
01:17:52,314 --> 01:17:54,139
How late?

903
01:17:54,149 --> 01:18:00,609
Look, I'm not busting your balls. You
told me it'd be there and it better be.

904
01:18:34,789 --> 01:18:37,148
Why do you think you can hurt people?

905
01:18:37,158 --> 01:18:40,218
-What?
-Just do damage and walk away.

906
01:18:40,662 --> 01:18:42,621
Don't you know what you leave behind?

907
01:18:42,631 --> 01:18:45,861
-Do I know you?
-Do you think about it?

908
01:18:46,334 --> 01:18:48,799
Does it keep you up at night?

909
01:18:49,638 --> 01:18:52,163
-Does it haunt you?
-Excuse me?

910
01:18:52,173 --> 01:18:53,598
Because it haunts me.

911
01:18:53,608 --> 01:18:55,967
Are you one of them
press paparazzo freaks?

912
01:18:55,977 --> 01:18:58,370
You got a fucking camera there?

913
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:00,672
You can't take my fucking picture.

914
01:19:00,682 --> 01:19:06,207
You're gonna come to my fucking place
and take my fucking picture?

915
01:19:06,988 --> 01:19:08,984
You fuck!

916
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:11,788
-You a fucking cop?
-You wish.

917
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:15,420
Well, it looks like he fell from up there.

918
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:19,457
Cause of death could be the fall.
It could be the crowbar stuck in his skull.

919
01:19:19,467 --> 01:19:21,697
I'd say 50-50 either way.

920
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:23,762
Shit.

921
01:19:23,772 --> 01:19:25,772
Maybe 70-30.

922
01:19:26,574 --> 01:19:30,835
I mean, come on, man. How many people
wanted this prick dead? Besides us?

923
01:19:30,845 --> 01:19:34,906
Too many.
The problem is he knew all of them.

924
01:19:35,083 --> 01:19:37,475
He wouldn't let anybody
get this close to him.

925
01:19:37,485 --> 01:19:41,179
You think someone did us a favor?
Maybe we should put him on the payroll.

926
01:19:41,189 --> 01:19:44,015
What, like someone think
they're doing our job for us?

927
01:19:44,025 --> 01:19:47,385
Saying, "Hey, New York's finest,
I'm gonna send you a little message.

928
01:19:47,395 --> 01:19:49,395
This is how it's done."

929
01:19:49,531 --> 01:19:51,222
-Get a shot right there.
-Officer!

930
01:19:51,232 --> 01:19:53,992
Here we go. All right, I'll be back.

931
01:19:54,002 --> 01:19:56,227
Erica, are you okay? Oh, my God.

932
01:19:56,237 --> 01:19:58,467
-Get out.
-My God!

933
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,575
-Get away!
-No, I won't get away.

934
01:20:02,477 --> 01:20:05,537
Don't touch me. I'm sick!

935
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:08,141
I can see that.

936
01:20:12,687 --> 01:20:15,547
-We have to get you to a hospital.
-No.

937
01:20:15,557 --> 01:20:16,948
No.

938
01:20:16,958 --> 01:20:19,927
-Why not?
-I can't because....

939
01:20:20,128 --> 01:20:22,426
Oh, God. I can't.

940
01:20:24,466 --> 01:20:27,333
What kind of trouble are you in?

941
01:20:28,436 --> 01:20:30,436
You don't wanna know.

942
01:21:23,291 --> 01:21:25,418
Were you a nurse?

943
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:27,821
When I had to be.

944
01:21:29,464 --> 01:21:32,092
This is going to leave a scar.

945
01:21:36,871 --> 01:21:39,567
I killed a man tonight.

946
01:21:41,176 --> 01:21:43,736
Because he did this to you?

947
01:21:44,979 --> 01:21:46,979
No.

948
01:21:48,016 --> 01:21:50,610
I would've killed him anyway.

949
01:21:54,289 --> 01:21:56,289
Back home...

950
01:21:56,858 --> 01:21:59,884
...they gave young boys guns.

951
01:22:01,396 --> 01:22:03,861
Made them kill their parents.

952
01:22:04,499 --> 01:22:06,763
Just to show us...

953
01:22:08,336 --> 01:22:10,295
...anyone...

954
01:22:10,305 --> 01:22:12,432
...can cross that line.

955
01:22:14,375 --> 01:22:16,843
Anyone can be a killer.

956
01:22:19,581 --> 01:22:22,243
Each death leaves a hole...

957
01:22:22,817 --> 01:22:24,978
...waiting to be filled.

958
01:22:33,194 --> 01:22:36,254
Did the ME come back
with his liver temperature yet?

959
01:22:36,264 --> 01:22:40,492
Yeah, he's about-- Dead about two hours
from when we got there.

960
01:22:40,502 --> 01:22:45,599
-So that puts us at what time?
-About 1:00, give or take.

961
01:22:46,341 --> 01:22:48,341
Damn.

962
01:22:48,576 --> 01:22:53,338
Okay, I want everyone from the subway
and from that market killing...

963
01:22:53,348 --> 01:22:56,441
-...I want them all brought in again.
-We've done all of that.

964
01:22:56,451 --> 01:22:59,444
We need to do it again.
We need to think outside the box.

965
01:22:59,454 --> 01:23:02,447
But he hit him with a crowbar,
hefted him over the rail.

966
01:23:02,457 --> 01:23:07,085
We're talking about a different guy
here, man. Think about it.

967
01:23:07,095 --> 01:23:09,095
Maybe.

968
01:23:09,397 --> 01:23:12,857
What about the iPod?
You said it traced back to a kid.

969
01:23:12,867 --> 01:23:15,527
I thought I told you.
The kid's father is an attorney.

970
01:23:15,537 --> 01:23:17,795
-He wants a subpoena, but I'm on it.
-Get him.

971
01:23:17,805 --> 01:23:22,565
-Whatever you gotta do--
-All right. I'll call right now.

972
01:23:28,416 --> 01:23:30,416
Hey, Erica.

973
01:23:31,386 --> 01:23:34,446
No, I just wanna know how you slept.

974
01:23:35,023 --> 01:23:37,488
Hey, you wanna see what I do?

975
01:23:38,059 --> 01:23:43,121
Well, meet me over at Wynnward Hospital
in Washington Heights.

976
01:23:43,131 --> 01:23:45,156
You'll get an idea.

977
01:23:45,833 --> 01:23:51,783
East 14 and Broadway, East 14 and
Broadway. None confirmed at the time.

978
01:23:56,711 --> 01:23:58,921
Why doesn't he march here?

979
01:23:58,947 --> 01:24:02,073
-March down the street.
-Ethan Grant, my man.

980
01:24:02,083 --> 01:24:04,745
Now sit your hippie ass down.

981
01:24:04,919 --> 01:24:06,919
You smoking pot?

982
01:24:06,955 --> 01:24:10,081
-I need to talk to you.
-My dad said not to get involved.

983
01:24:10,091 --> 01:24:13,151
Oh, yeah? Does your dad know
you smoke grass, huh?

984
01:24:13,161 --> 01:24:15,954
That's a lot more than
a misdemeanor these days.

985
01:24:15,964 --> 01:24:18,489
-Listen, I didn't see anything.
-I think you did.

986
01:24:18,499 --> 01:24:22,239
-Look at me. Hey, you selling this shit?
-No.

987
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:23,761
Well, I believe you.

988
01:24:23,771 --> 01:24:29,721
Maybe a judge won't. Come on, Skippy.
Get your shit. Let's go. Come on.

989
01:24:35,216 --> 01:24:37,241
-Hey. Thanks for coming.
-Hey.

990
01:24:37,251 --> 01:24:38,610
Sure.

991
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:41,680
-Nice jacket.
-Thanks.

992
01:24:42,123 --> 01:24:44,515
So, what time
you got to sleep last night?

993
01:24:44,525 --> 01:24:47,185
I don't know, pretty soon
after we hung up, I guess.

994
01:24:47,195 --> 01:24:50,760
-About 1, 1:30?
-Yeah. Something like that.

995
01:24:50,770 --> 01:24:54,132
Yeah. I ended up working all night.

996
01:24:55,503 --> 01:24:59,063
You know you're not gonna be able
to reference this on your show?

997
01:24:59,073 --> 01:25:01,623
Sure, if I knew what this was.

998
01:25:01,809 --> 01:25:05,634
We're gonna interview
a witness to a shooting.

999
01:25:05,847 --> 01:25:08,673
-Isn't that against procedure?
-Yeah.

1000
01:25:08,683 --> 01:25:10,742
But I've tried to talk to her twice...

1001
01:25:10,752 --> 01:25:13,378
...and she seemed real nervous
to talk to me.

1002
01:25:13,388 --> 01:25:16,080
I figure maybe if you were there,
she'll talk.

1003
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:17,982
Why me?

1004
01:25:17,992 --> 01:25:20,287
Because you got me to talk.

1005
01:25:29,904 --> 01:25:31,904
Hi, Chloe.

1006
01:25:34,642 --> 01:25:36,767
How are we feeling today?

1007
01:25:37,545 --> 01:25:39,545
All right.

1008
01:25:43,685 --> 01:25:45,685
I brought a friend.

1009
01:25:49,257 --> 01:25:51,257
Hi, Chloe.

1010
01:25:56,531 --> 01:25:58,531
Hi.

1011
01:26:12,947 --> 01:26:18,302
So you feel like telling me what happened
to you that night now?

1012
01:26:33,134 --> 01:26:35,534
That's a pretty necklace.

1013
01:26:44,846 --> 01:26:47,736
You should tell them what you saw.

1014
01:26:48,149 --> 01:26:51,585
Whatever it was, tell them the truth.

1015
01:26:55,923 --> 01:26:57,923
It's okay.

1016
01:27:01,963 --> 01:27:03,963
I saw....

1017
01:27:10,338 --> 01:27:12,568
I saw nobody.

1018
01:27:15,042 --> 01:27:19,122
Come on, Chloe.
Tell me the truth now, all right?

1019
01:27:20,915 --> 01:27:22,915
And nobody saw me.

1020
01:27:31,159 --> 01:27:33,159
Okay.

1021
01:27:33,361 --> 01:27:35,401
Sorry if that upset you.

1022
01:27:36,631 --> 01:27:40,124
Well, I'm sorry that
I couldn't be more help back there.

1023
01:27:40,134 --> 01:27:43,227
Well, you definitely seemed to help her.

1024
01:27:43,237 --> 01:27:45,467
She sure liked your...

1025
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:47,532
...necklace.

1026
01:27:47,542 --> 01:27:49,542
It meant a lot to me.

1027
01:27:58,386 --> 01:28:00,386
Erica?

1028
01:28:00,922 --> 01:28:04,619
-Yeah.
-Why'd you call me last night?

1029
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:08,125
I told you, I couldn't sleep.

1030
01:28:09,497 --> 01:28:11,497
And you were in bed?

1031
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:15,567
No. I couldn't sleep.

1032
01:28:25,313 --> 01:28:28,039
You wanna tell us again
why you didn't wanna come in?

1033
01:28:28,049 --> 01:28:31,742
-For what? To get back my iPod?
-Hey, watch your ass.

1034
01:28:31,752 --> 01:28:34,612
I don't know. I had mixed feelings.

1035
01:28:34,622 --> 01:28:37,415
I mean, I was kind of glad
those guys got killed.

1036
01:28:37,425 --> 01:28:41,219
-You were glad?
-Yeah. I know I shouldn't be, but I was.

1037
01:28:41,229 --> 01:28:45,489
-While we're young, give us a statement.
-Look, I didn't see any vigilante.

1038
01:28:45,499 --> 01:28:47,758
Those guys smacked me around
and took my iPod.

1039
01:28:47,768 --> 01:28:50,695
Then they hassled some black dude
sitting next to his kid...

1040
01:28:50,705 --> 01:28:54,832
...so we all got off,
except for some woman at the back.

1041
01:28:54,842 --> 01:28:56,634
A woman.

1042
01:28:56,644 --> 01:29:00,238
Yeah, just a woman.
She was staying out of it.

1043
01:29:00,248 --> 01:29:02,506
Maybe the vigi guy got on
at the next stop.

1044
01:29:02,516 --> 01:29:07,511
Can you describe this woman well enough
for an artist to make a sketch?

1045
01:29:07,521 --> 01:29:09,517
I can try.

1046
01:29:09,527 --> 01:29:12,216
Where are you going
with this woman thing?

1047
01:29:12,226 --> 01:29:14,226
I'm not sure yet.

1048
01:29:15,129 --> 01:29:20,024
Women kill their kids, their husbands,
boyfriends, shit they love.

1049
01:29:20,034 --> 01:29:21,726
They don't do this.

1050
01:29:21,736 --> 01:29:23,427
-How you doing?
-They don't?

1051
01:29:23,437 --> 01:29:25,096
-Good.
-You need some more water?

1052
01:29:25,106 --> 01:29:26,764
-Nope.
-Okay.

1053
01:29:26,774 --> 01:29:30,034
Just think about the first moment
that you met her. All right?

1054
01:29:30,044 --> 01:29:32,570
Where you were, where she was.

1055
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:35,640
Tell me anything that comes to mind.

1056
01:29:36,217 --> 01:29:38,597
She had light hair, I think.

1057
01:29:39,921 --> 01:29:44,620
And okay lips. And she was skinny.

1058
01:29:44,792 --> 01:29:49,855
But she had some ass.
You know, you could tell because--

1059
01:29:50,264 --> 01:29:53,825
-But you're not doing the ass, right?
-No.

1060
01:29:54,001 --> 01:29:56,001
Okay.

1061
01:29:56,904 --> 01:29:58,904
She had good skin.

1062
01:30:00,074 --> 01:30:02,033
It was smooth.

1063
01:30:02,043 --> 01:30:04,876
And nice breasts.

1064
01:30:05,046 --> 01:30:08,639
Yeah. Like, they were little,
like Kate Moss titties.

1065
01:30:08,649 --> 01:30:11,409
-But they looked good with--
-Try to focus on the face.

1066
01:30:11,419 --> 01:30:13,419
Oh, I'm sorry.

1067
01:30:14,622 --> 01:30:17,481
-Hey, you know what I do remember?
-What?

1068
01:30:17,491 --> 01:30:19,786
She was, like, on lockdown.

1069
01:30:20,828 --> 01:30:24,559
I mean, shut off. Kind of scary.

1070
01:31:16,584 --> 01:31:18,584
"It's not cream.

1071
01:31:20,688 --> 01:31:22,986
It's vanilla."

1072
01:31:30,998 --> 01:31:33,466
You left a hole in me.

1073
01:31:36,637 --> 01:31:38,637
But I'm done now.

1074
01:31:39,573 --> 01:31:41,573
You hear me?

1075
01:31:44,612 --> 01:31:46,612
I'm done now.

1076
01:31:50,918 --> 01:31:54,678
Great. It's Jennifer Aniston.
I knew he was bullshitting us.

1077
01:31:54,688 --> 01:31:57,715
No, not really. This is a phenomenon
that happens quite often.

1078
01:31:57,725 --> 01:32:00,151
The mind gets so saturated
with popular images...

1079
01:32:00,161 --> 01:32:04,355
...it's often difficult, especially for people
under 20, to recall something unique.

1080
01:32:04,365 --> 01:32:05,923
That's Mr. Murrow.

1081
01:32:05,933 --> 01:32:11,228
He owns the parking out on
Roosevelt Island. That's not all he does.

1082
01:32:11,238 --> 01:32:12,863
What else does he do?

1083
01:32:12,873 --> 01:32:15,774
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.

1084
01:32:15,943 --> 01:32:19,003
-Then this is off the record.
-Erica!

1085
01:32:19,747 --> 01:32:21,743
Who is it?

1086
01:32:21,753 --> 01:32:26,254
It's Detective Mercer.
Could I have a minute with you?

1087
01:32:27,154 --> 01:32:29,452
Yeah. Yeah, just a second.

1088
01:32:40,734 --> 01:32:42,734
-Hey.
-Hey.

1089
01:32:42,837 --> 01:32:46,063
I tried to call, but there was no answer.

1090
01:32:46,073 --> 01:32:48,073
The ringer must be off.

1091
01:32:48,776 --> 01:32:52,872
-Can I come in?
-Yeah, sure. Come on in.

1092
01:33:00,354 --> 01:33:04,349
-It's pretty dark in here.
-I like it like that.

1093
01:33:08,696 --> 01:33:10,696
Got something....

1094
01:33:13,033 --> 01:33:15,033
Is this yours?

1095
01:33:17,638 --> 01:33:21,335
-Where'd you find it?
-Spanish Harlem.

1096
01:33:21,942 --> 01:33:27,141
A uniform pinched the suspect's girlfriend
trying to pawn it.

1097
01:33:27,581 --> 01:33:30,726
He fit the description that you gave.

1098
01:33:32,686 --> 01:33:34,686
Oh, my God.

1099
01:33:34,788 --> 01:33:36,828
I need a favor from you.

1100
01:33:36,891 --> 01:33:41,651
I'd like for you to come downtown
and ID him in a lineup.

1101
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,858
No. I can't.

1102
01:33:47,868 --> 01:33:52,966
I understand you're nervous,
but you won't be alone in there.

1103
01:33:52,976 --> 01:33:54,973
I promise.

1104
01:34:00,114 --> 01:34:02,114
I'll get my stuff.

1105
01:34:05,553 --> 01:34:07,553
Thanks.

1106
01:34:32,146 --> 01:34:34,146
Okay, let's go.

1107
01:34:34,448 --> 01:34:38,275
You're going to view five subjects,
and then I'm gonna ask you three questions:

1108
01:34:38,285 --> 01:34:43,847
Do you recognize anyone? Where do you
know them from? And what did they do?

1109
01:34:43,857 --> 01:34:45,950
Lights and blinds.

1110
01:34:48,429 --> 01:34:51,149
Number one, approach the mirror.

1111
01:34:55,903 --> 01:34:57,761
No.

1112
01:34:57,771 --> 01:35:01,256
Sit down.
Number two, approach the mirror.

1113
01:35:03,510 --> 01:35:05,202
No.

1114
01:35:05,212 --> 01:35:08,867
Sit down.
Number three, approach the mirror.

1115
01:35:20,094 --> 01:35:22,094
No.

1116
01:35:22,196 --> 01:35:25,766
Sit down.
Number four, approach the mirror.

1117
01:35:28,469 --> 01:35:31,562
I can see them all. It's none of them.

1118
01:35:31,572 --> 01:35:34,234
Sit down. You're sure?

1119
01:35:34,408 --> 01:35:37,104
Yeah. I'm sorry.

1120
01:35:38,345 --> 01:35:40,345
I really am.

1121
01:35:41,649 --> 01:35:43,649
I'm so sorry.

1122
01:35:49,156 --> 01:35:53,050
Damn, I thought we had him.
You think she just froze up?

1123
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:55,319
Doesn't really seem like the type,
you know?

1124
01:35:55,329 --> 01:35:57,329
I don't know.

1125
01:36:01,201 --> 01:36:03,726
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1126
01:36:03,904 --> 01:36:06,363
That looked like
it was pretty tough on you.

1127
01:36:06,373 --> 01:36:10,434
It was. I was kind of hoping
I was finally done.

1128
01:36:10,611 --> 01:36:13,771
Yeah, well, I'm off now.
Let's go get some food.

1129
01:36:13,781 --> 01:36:18,371
-No, I'm not hungry. That's okay.
-No, you need to eat.

1130
01:36:20,621 --> 01:36:23,522
I can barely remember his hands.

1131
01:36:23,791 --> 01:36:26,089
Perhaps you need to forget.

1132
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,960
I can't.

1133
01:36:29,830 --> 01:36:32,162
I miss who I was with him.

1134
01:36:34,134 --> 01:36:36,134
You know that feeling?

1135
01:36:39,606 --> 01:36:41,606
You know...

1136
01:36:41,975 --> 01:36:46,820
...this is Mughal. It was a gift
from David's grandmother.

1137
01:36:51,885 --> 01:36:53,910
Speaking of gifts....

1138
01:36:56,056 --> 01:36:59,683
You know, someone gave me
a gift the other night.

1139
01:36:59,693 --> 01:37:01,693
Yeah?

1140
01:37:03,497 --> 01:37:08,230
You recall that guy we saw on TV
at the coffee shop?

1141
01:37:09,303 --> 01:37:13,933
The one I've been trying to put away
for three years.

1142
01:37:15,242 --> 01:37:18,202
Apparently somebody else
must've had something against him...

1143
01:37:18,212 --> 01:37:22,122
...because we're not talking
about a 9 mm here.

1144
01:37:22,316 --> 01:37:26,480
It got real personal.

1145
01:37:27,121 --> 01:37:29,121
Yeah, I read about it.

1146
01:37:37,831 --> 01:37:42,251
We got some more information
on that subway shooting.

1147
01:37:44,271 --> 01:37:47,586
Turns out there was a woman on the car.

1148
01:37:47,875 --> 01:37:52,870
Now, all this time, we've been looking
for a man with a gun.

1149
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:55,440
It was a woman with a grudge.

1150
01:37:58,152 --> 01:38:01,807
Well, I guess there's a lot of us
out there.

1151
01:38:08,362 --> 01:38:11,677
You know, Erica, when I was a rookie...

1152
01:38:13,634 --> 01:38:16,609
...I used to give myself this test.

1153
01:38:16,870 --> 01:38:22,866
I would ask myself, if there was someone
that I knew that had committed a crime...

1154
01:38:22,876 --> 01:38:26,786
...would I have the fortitude
to put them away?

1155
01:38:28,248 --> 01:38:30,248
What kind of someone?

1156
01:38:30,918 --> 01:38:36,788
Someone close to me.
Like the best friend I could ever....

1157
01:38:37,858 --> 01:38:40,326
I could ever hope to have.

1158
01:38:43,297 --> 01:38:45,297
And...?

1159
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:52,790
I always hoped that I would have
the courage and the dedication to say yes.

1160
01:38:53,941 --> 01:38:55,941
And do you?

1161
01:38:56,810 --> 01:38:58,810
I do.

1162
01:38:59,379 --> 01:39:02,609
And it's important that you know that.

1163
01:39:04,585 --> 01:39:06,585
I know that.

1164
01:39:07,988 --> 01:39:10,479
It's what I admire about you.

1165
01:39:20,567 --> 01:39:24,901
One more piece of evidence,
and she goes down.

1166
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:29,220
And I'm sure you'll find it.

1167
01:39:29,877 --> 01:39:34,610
You're a good detective.
You miss nothing.

1168
01:39:37,651 --> 01:39:39,651
I have to go.

1169
01:39:41,822 --> 01:39:44,256
-I got it.
-Okay.

1170
01:39:44,424 --> 01:39:46,424
Hang on.

1171
01:39:46,727 --> 01:39:48,727
Hey.

1172
01:39:57,404 --> 01:40:01,824
-I wonder what David would think of--
-Think of what?

1173
01:40:05,812 --> 01:40:08,303
This woman with a grudge.

1174
01:40:12,819 --> 01:40:14,819
I don't know.

1175
01:40:16,924 --> 01:40:18,983
The dead don't talk.

1176
01:40:20,561 --> 01:40:22,561
At least not to me.

1177
01:40:44,284 --> 01:40:46,284
All right, thanks.

1178
01:41:11,311 --> 01:41:13,711
Hey, can I get Joey Mortell?

1179
01:41:18,085 --> 01:41:19,476
Crackheads.

1180
01:41:19,486 --> 01:41:23,481
I got you stuck in traffic,
88th and 3rd Avenue.

1181
01:41:23,590 --> 01:41:28,085
Pull over at the corner, Roma 's Pizza.
Get yourself a slice.

1182
01:41:28,095 --> 01:41:31,688
-No, I'm not gonna be here that long.
- You are gonna be there that long...

1183
01:41:31,698 --> 01:41:35,225
...because I got traffic backed up on 3rd
all the way to 96th Street.

1184
01:41:35,235 --> 01:41:39,129
-Make yourself comfortable.
-Well, I need you to do me a favor, okay?

1185
01:41:39,139 --> 01:41:44,068
Can you run a trace on a call?
And I don't have a subpoena.

1186
01:41:44,078 --> 01:41:46,287
But you'll get one, right?

1187
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:48,680
Yeah, if I have to.

1188
01:41:49,549 --> 01:41:51,549
All right.

1189
01:41:52,185 --> 01:41:54,344
Give me the date and the time.

1190
01:41:54,354 --> 01:41:56,564
Two days ago, July 20th...

1191
01:41:57,324 --> 01:41:59,619
...between 12 and 1:30 a.m.

1192
01:41:59,726 --> 01:42:02,653
All right. Okay, I need the number.

1193
01:42:02,663 --> 01:42:04,663
Hold on.

1194
01:42:07,534 --> 01:42:10,298
-It's 917...
-Yeah.

1195
01:42:10,470 --> 01:42:15,373
-... 157- 1431.
-All right, give me the name.

1196
01:42:15,542 --> 01:42:18,841
Look, it's private, like I said.

1197
01:42:19,012 --> 01:42:21,004
Okay, it's that kind of private. I see.

1198
01:42:21,014 --> 01:42:24,207
All right. Okay, yeah, I got you covered.

1199
01:42:24,217 --> 01:42:27,872
-Okay, just call me, all right?
-You got it.

1200
01:42:34,428 --> 01:42:36,638
You seen this ring before?

1201
01:42:37,330 --> 01:42:39,330
It looks familiar.

1202
01:42:49,276 --> 01:42:52,575
I got a name. Shauna Nelson.

1203
01:42:52,746 --> 01:42:54,771
An address, a cell phone.

1204
01:42:54,781 --> 01:42:56,707
What'd she look like?

1205
01:42:56,717 --> 01:43:01,878
She had two eyes, a mouth and a nose,
right in the middle of her face.

1206
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:04,608
Please get the fuck out of here.

1207
01:43:19,339 --> 01:43:21,339
Yeah.

1208
01:43:26,813 --> 01:43:30,180
Shut up. Shut up. That is--

1209
01:43:31,918 --> 01:43:33,918
It's true.

1210
01:43:34,488 --> 01:43:36,488
Hello?

1211
01:43:36,890 --> 01:43:38,890
Hello?

1212
01:43:38,925 --> 01:43:40,517
-Do you know this number?
-No.

1213
01:43:40,527 --> 01:43:42,757
Are you sure? 917.

1214
01:43:42,929 --> 01:43:46,089
Hey, you guys, are 917-- Fuck you guys.
I'll see you later, okay?

1215
01:43:46,099 --> 01:43:48,099
-Bye.
-Later.

1216
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:09,320
Hey!

1217
01:44:11,591 --> 01:44:13,817
-Are you Shauna?
-Did you just call me?

1218
01:44:13,827 --> 01:44:19,182
Yeah, l-- I got your number from
the pawn shop. You had my ring.

1219
01:44:19,699 --> 01:44:22,526
Yeah. Motherfucker fucks some slut...

1220
01:44:22,536 --> 01:44:24,995
...gives me the ring
as a fucking make-up gift.

1221
01:44:25,005 --> 01:44:28,131
-Turns out he stole the shit.
-I wanna know where he is.

1222
01:44:28,141 --> 01:44:30,521
Can you tell me where he is?

1223
01:44:31,912 --> 01:44:33,336
-l--
-No. No.

1224
01:44:33,346 --> 01:44:35,972
-I need an address. Phone number, anything.
-No.

1225
01:44:35,982 --> 01:44:38,177
-Tell me where he is!
-No!

1226
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:42,315
I saw what they did to you.

1227
01:44:43,356 --> 01:44:45,821
That shit can't happen to me.

1228
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:51,354
The call lasted
three minutes and 46 seconds.

1229
01:44:51,364 --> 01:44:53,855
From 12:26 to 12:30...

1230
01:44:54,034 --> 01:44:59,062
...from 917-157-1431 to your cell phone.

1231
01:44:59,673 --> 01:45:02,138
Vicinity of Roosevelt Island.

1232
01:45:03,043 --> 01:45:06,136
Did she tell you she was someplace else?

1233
01:45:06,146 --> 01:45:09,047
-Yes, she did.
-I'm sorry, man.

1234
01:45:09,216 --> 01:45:11,212
But fuck her, right?

1235
01:45:11,222 --> 01:45:13,652
-Fuck her.
-Yup.

1236
01:45:13,820 --> 01:45:15,645
Fuck her.

1237
01:45:15,655 --> 01:45:17,782
Hey, do me a favor.

1238
01:45:18,625 --> 01:45:21,017
Keep this to yourself until...

1239
01:45:21,027 --> 01:45:26,297
-...I can get that subpoena.
-Didn't even go on the hard drive.

1240
01:45:47,854 --> 01:45:49,854
Action!

1241
01:45:51,358 --> 01:45:53,908
Think you're fucking with me?!

1242
01:46:04,271 --> 01:46:09,796
Popped your motherfucking cherry!
Over there. Let's even shit out.

1243
01:46:13,413 --> 01:46:15,138
Heads up!

1244
01:46:15,148 --> 01:46:17,148
Hollywood!

1245
01:46:19,619 --> 01:46:22,611
How cute. Lovebirds.

1246
01:47:03,229 --> 01:47:05,229
Action!

1247
01:47:06,733 --> 01:47:09,283
Think you're fucking with me?!

1248
01:48:22,609 --> 01:48:26,519
-You guys wanna make money or not?
-Hell, yeah.

1249
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:30,240
You know what to do. Stand on that corner
and keep an eye out.

1250
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:32,509
Show me you can do this.
Show me you're ready.

1251
01:48:32,519 --> 01:48:36,312
Stand next to the four guys,
keep your mouth shut and your eyes open.

1252
01:48:36,322 --> 01:48:37,914
Cops come, what do you do?

1253
01:48:37,924 --> 01:48:39,924
-Run!
-Run, right?

1254
01:49:18,965 --> 01:49:22,358
Good. Listen, motherfuckers,
stand on that sidewalk, keep an eye open.

1255
01:49:22,368 --> 01:49:24,961
-How hard can that shit be? Right?
-Yeah.

1256
01:49:24,971 --> 01:49:29,816
Good. So get going. Get on
that fucking sidewalk. Come on.

1257
01:49:39,786 --> 01:49:41,744
You want something?

1258
01:49:41,754 --> 01:49:43,754
I want my dog back.

1259
01:49:46,326 --> 01:49:48,218
The fuck?

1260
01:49:48,228 --> 01:49:50,696
Hi. Hi, boy. It's me.

1261
01:49:51,231 --> 01:49:53,927
Hey. Hey, buddy. Hey.

1262
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:56,426
Do you remember me? Huh, boy?

1263
01:49:56,436 --> 01:49:58,436
Come on, man.

1264
01:49:59,973 --> 01:50:01,531
Go, go!

1265
01:50:01,541 --> 01:50:05,535
No, you got me fucking waiting,
and I need an address!

1266
01:50:05,545 --> 01:50:08,775
For Reed Bryant. He came in yesterday.

1267
01:50:35,275 --> 01:50:36,933
Get away, bitch!

1268
01:50:36,943 --> 01:50:38,943
Who's the bitch now?

1269
01:50:44,751 --> 01:50:47,345
-90 Clayton Avenue.
-Thank you.

1270
01:51:18,885 --> 01:51:21,350
Get the fuck out of the road!

1271
01:51:56,522 --> 01:52:00,602
-Hey, puppy.
-Don't you know there's a leash law?

1272
01:52:02,161 --> 01:52:04,425
For a bitch like you!

1273
01:52:05,531 --> 01:52:08,324
It's just you and me
and the fucking dog again, bitch!

1274
01:52:08,334 --> 01:52:11,794
I made your boyfriend smile.
I'm gonna make you smile too, bitch!

1275
01:52:11,804 --> 01:52:15,064
-You think you can come after me, huh?
-Get on the ground!

1276
01:52:15,074 --> 01:52:19,135
Get on the fucking ground! Police!
On the ground! Lay flat on the ground!

1277
01:52:19,145 --> 01:52:21,371
-Drop the gun, Erica!
-Stay out of this!

1278
01:52:21,381 --> 01:52:23,273
-No.
-This is between him and me!

1279
01:52:23,283 --> 01:52:25,942
-You do not have the right.
-Yes, I do!

1280
01:52:25,952 --> 01:52:28,811
No. I have the right
to hunt him down and to shoot him.

1281
01:52:28,821 --> 01:52:30,013
Then shoot him, then!

1282
01:52:30,023 --> 01:52:32,982
I don't do that shit, I investigate it.
Now give me the gun.

1283
01:52:32,992 --> 01:52:36,319
-And what are you gonna do, Mercer?
-Come on.

1284
01:52:36,329 --> 01:52:38,321
-You gonna arrest him?
-Give me the gun.

1285
01:52:38,331 --> 01:52:40,056
-Arrest me, officer!
-Shut up!

1286
01:52:40,066 --> 01:52:41,858
-Give me the gun!
-Come on, cuff me!

1287
01:52:41,868 --> 01:52:44,758
-Shut up!
-Give me the gun, I said.

1288
01:52:45,638 --> 01:52:47,833
Come on. Good girl.

1289
01:52:48,374 --> 01:52:50,467
That's it. Good girl.

1290
01:52:52,412 --> 01:52:54,412
No.

1291
01:53:01,587 --> 01:53:06,490
Now, if you're gonna use a gun,
you make sure it's legal.

1292
01:53:06,659 --> 01:53:08,718
What the fuck are you doing, man?

1293
01:53:08,728 --> 01:53:10,720
-Ain't nobody talking to you.
-Come on--

1294
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:13,356
-I saw that shit you did!
-You're a fucking cop!

1295
01:53:13,366 --> 01:53:14,590
-Not tonight.
-Come on!

1296
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:19,275
-Put me in cuffs! Get me out of here!
-Shut the fuck up!

1297
01:53:39,192 --> 01:53:41,192
You can take me now.

1298
01:53:43,229 --> 01:53:46,926
Problem is, if you go down,
I go down.

1299
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:50,968
No. I can't let you do that for me.

1300
01:54:02,115 --> 01:54:05,430
So you've got one person left to shoot.

1301
01:54:06,686 --> 01:54:08,311
What?

1302
01:54:08,321 --> 01:54:11,984
You see, there was never any vigilante.

1303
01:54:12,158 --> 01:54:16,068
It was just three punks
out on a killing spree.

1304
01:54:17,530 --> 01:54:21,185
They got a taste for it up in Central Park.

1305
01:54:22,268 --> 01:54:25,073
And they bought themselves a gun.

1306
01:54:27,106 --> 01:54:31,543
And they turned on each other,
the way they do.

1307
01:54:31,711 --> 01:54:33,711
And somehow...

1308
01:54:33,846 --> 01:54:36,007
...I got winged and...

1309
01:54:36,983 --> 01:54:39,193
...I did what I had to do.

1310
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:43,220
Right here.

1311
01:54:46,325 --> 01:54:49,385
-I can't.
-You only shoot bad guys?

1312
01:54:50,229 --> 01:54:55,839
I've joined that club. Now you nick me,
graze me, but you wound me.

1313
01:54:59,172 --> 01:55:01,172
From about 3 feet.

1314
01:55:08,381 --> 01:55:13,481
-My hands are shaking.
-You just make sure you miss my heart.

1315
01:55:20,493 --> 01:55:23,553
Damn! Motherfuck, that shit hurts!

1316
01:55:23,729 --> 01:55:25,729
I'm sorry.

1317
01:55:26,098 --> 01:55:28,098
I'm sorry.

1318
01:55:28,267 --> 01:55:30,159
So am l.

1319
01:55:30,169 --> 01:55:34,164
Now you get out of here
before I lose my temper.

1320
01:56:26,659 --> 01:56:30,059
Baby, look at you.
She left you too, huh?

1321
01:56:30,530 --> 01:56:34,490
That's okay. I got you now.
You're gonna be fine. Come here.

1322
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:36,880
Come here. Wait, wait, wait!

1323
01:56:50,216 --> 01:56:53,777
10-13, 10-13. Officer hit.

1324
01:56:53,953 --> 01:56:57,821
Three perps down at 90 Clayton.

1325
01:56:59,325 --> 01:57:01,325
Send a bus.

1326
01:57:45,371 --> 01:57:50,365
There is no going back
to that other person...

1327
01:57:51,210 --> 01:57:53,269
...that other place.

1328
01:57:53,646 --> 01:57:57,912
This thing, this stranger...

1329
01:57:58,818 --> 01:58:01,719
...she is all you are now.

1330
