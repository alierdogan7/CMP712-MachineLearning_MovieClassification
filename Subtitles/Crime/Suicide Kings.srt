TEEK, CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION ?
YEAH, SURE.

1085
01:06:15,802 --> 01:06:17,804
WHAT'S UP ?

1086
01:06:21,808 --> 01:06:25,311
YOU KNOW, I WAS WATCHIN'...
WHEN YOU CUT
CHARLIE'S FINGER OFF.

1087
01:06:25,812 --> 01:06:29,315
CAN'T GET THAT IMAGE
OUT OF MY MIND.

1088
01:06:29,315 --> 01:06:32,318
THEY DID THE SAME THING
TO ELISE.

1089
01:06:35,822 --> 01:06:38,825
YOU THINK THEY HURT HER
WHEN THEY DID THAT ?
DON'T DO THAT.

DON'T, MAN.
DON'T DO THAT
TO YOURSELF.

I'M NOT--
I SAW YA OUT OF
THE CORNER OF MY EYE.

1100
01:07:05,351 --> 01:07:07,854
I SAW YOU LOOKIN' OUT OF
THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE.
I LIKE THE BOOTS.

1101
01:07:07,854 --> 01:07:10,356
I WOULDN'T SPEND $1,500.
YOU GOTTA BE OUT OF YOUR MIND.

1102
01:07:10,857 --> 01:07:12,859
IT'S NOT LIKE SNAKESKIN.

-YOU EVER SEND A GUY A NEWSPAPER

- SHUT THE FUCK UP, MAN !
- AH, YOU GOT ME MIXED UP WITH
  SOMETHING FROM THE MOVIES.

GENTLEMEN, KEEP IN MIND THAT
THE CARDS YOU HOLD IN YOUR HANDS
ARE NOTHING BUT DUMB LUCK.

1134
01:09:08,091 --> 01:09:13,596
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WINNING
AND LOSING IS BEING ABLE
TO READ YOUR OPPONENT.

YET, IRA'S EYES DON'T FLOAT.
HE'S GOT HIS SENSE OF FAIR PLAY.

1146
01:09:59,025 --> 01:10:02,528
AS WE ALL KNOW,
IRA CAN'T BLUFF HIS WAY
OUT OF A PAPER BAG.

1147
01:10:03,029 --> 01:10:05,031
I CAN TELL YOU HIS BET
BEFORE HE COULD.

- FOLD.
- THAT ALSO MAKES SENSE.

01:10:37,563 --> 01:10:41,567
HOW ABOUT BRETT,
CONTROL JUNKIE ?

1159
01:10:41,567 --> 01:10:44,070
BRETT CAN'T LEAVE
ANYTHING TO CHANCE.
LOOK AT HIM.

1160
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:48,074
HE WOULDN'T EVEN PLAY,
UNLESS HE'S LOOKING ACROSS
THE TABLE AT A SURE THING.

HE'S A WILD MAN.

WE'RE IN ATLANTIC CITY,
I HAD TO LOCK HIM IN A ROOM.

1165
01:11:02,088 --> 01:11:04,590

OKAY ?  I'M TRYIN' TO TELL
A STORY HERE.

1170
01:11:19,105 --> 01:11:21,107
- IRA.
- WHAT ?

1171
01:11:21,107 --> 01:11:26,112
YOU CAN'T TELL A STORY HERE.
YOU CAN'T TELL A STORY ANYWHERE.
YOU SCREW IT UP EVERY TIME.

1172
01:11:26,112 --> 01:11:29,115
- NO, I DO NOT.
- YOU'RE DOING IT NOW.

1173

- WELL, IS SOMEBODY GOING
  TO TELL A STORY ?
- I WAS TELLING THE STORY !

01:11:46,132 --> 01:11:48,134
IT WAS LABOR DAY, IRA,
LIKE T.K. SAID.

1179
01:11:48,634 --> 01:11:51,637
IT WAS SCORCHIN' OUTSIDE,
IT WAS SO FUCKIN' HOT.
DON'T YOU REMEMBER THAT ?

01:11:51,754 --> 01:11:54,757
THE ROOM WAS FREEZIN' THOUGH.
YOU COULD HANG MEAT IN THIS

01:12:02,265 --> 01:12:05,768
IT'S GETTIN' REALLY LATE.

SO I FIGURE IT'S SAFE
TO GO TO THE JOHN, RIGHT ?

1197
01:12:44,307 --> 01:12:47,810

I COME BACK, HE'S DOWN 12.

1198
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:51,314
I TRY TO TALK HIM INTO

TAKES OUT A MARKER.

HE'S COME OUT FIVE GRAND AHEAD.

1202
01:13:04,327 --> 01:13:07,830
HE TAKES ONE LOOK AT THIS LITTLE
WIMP, AND HE DUMPS HIS FIVE Gs
RIGHT ON TOP OF BRETT'S ACTION.

1203
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:11,834
THESE CLOWNS, THEY'RE GONNA
TAKE THE WIDOWMAKER'S BALLS HOME
AND HIS LUGGAGE WITH ONE HAND.

1204
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:15,838
SO WHAT DOES
BRETT THE GENIUS DO ?
HE DOUBLES DOWN !

1205
01:13:15,838 --> 01:13:20,343
