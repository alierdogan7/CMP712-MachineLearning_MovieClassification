1
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,702
<i>Please, get me to a hospital!</i>

2
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,665
l can't breathe.

3
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,406
You know what? lf you were smart,
you would stop talking right now.

4
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,943
Sue me. l just know that women
should never work for women.

5
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,136
How can you say that?

6
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,372
Because they're always threatened.

7
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,642
Especially if you're beautiful,
and they're not.

8
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,376
Fine! You never had a fight with your boss?

9
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,611
Never. You know why?

10
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,248
Because he's a man.

11
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,913
Can we please drop this?

12
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,924
l just want to go home and kiss my son.
Honey.

13
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:10,086
See, you have to mention
that you have a child and we don't.

14
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,926
-There's my point.
-Erit, l didn't say anything of the sort.

15
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,432
Don't apologize, it's genetics.

16
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,560
Women are always competing
with each other.

17
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,433
That's why you're having problems
with your boss.

18
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,734
-Because she's a woman.
-Exactly.

19
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,935
Women should work under men,
men under women. That's it.

20
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,334
What about men under men?

21
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,578
That's fine, too.
l mean, they can deal with it.

22
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,450
-Can we go now?
-Either of you guys want another drink?

23
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,609
-We're good.
-Shot? Double?

24
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,586
Women can do amazing things.
l am one. l know.

25
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,178
But even l would never work for me.

26
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,087
That we can agree on. Good night, Mick.

27
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,819
We are in a bad mood.

28
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:44,294
She's got a point, bro, you know.
l'd much rather work under you than her.

29
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:48,397
That's nice. l'd rather work under him, too.

30
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,427
You'd rather ''work'' under John?

31
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,833
You have a problem with that, too?

32
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,704
No! Why would l have a problem
with your little sexual innuendo?

33
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:57,935
What is up your ass tonight?

34
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:02,005
So l should just sit here while you come on
to my husband right in front of me?

35
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:05,949
Lara, if l wanted your husband,
l would have him, like that.

36
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,247
How? You couldn't possibly show him
more of those tits.

37
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,981
-You know what your problem is?
-Okay.. .

38
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,319
My problem is your brain
is as big as those tits.

39
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:13,790
-Baby, this is your fault!
-Huge, exactly!

40
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:14,860
This is your.. .

41
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,054
lf you had half a brain,
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

42
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,892
Baby. Let it go, let it go, let it go.

43
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,757
-Good night, brother dear!
-Good night!

44
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,598
-She's completely full of herself.
-Don't try and agree with me now!

45
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,433
l don't even think
she's a member of the dental profession.

46
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,801
Shut up!

47
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:30,774
She probably can't even
spell ''anaesthesiologist.' '

48
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,108
-The woman's a complete fraud.
-We went to her office party, you idiot!

49
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,444
And l believe she hit on me
that night as well.

50
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,110
You are completely delusional. She didn't
even hit on you in there. l just don't like her.

51
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,587
l understand your point of view. l really do.
l agree with you.

52
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,353
Somebody who looks like that should not
be allowed anywhere near oral surgery.

53
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,360
You are an asshole!

54
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,995
You're sitting in the chair,
you're trying to stay calm,

55
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,193
and you got them things
hanging in your face.. .

56
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,262
-So, see you next weekend. All right?
-Okay.

57
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,394
-Thank you.
-Good night.

58
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,869
-Bye.
-Bye!

59
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,098
Bye!

60
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,974
Oh, gee.

61
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:52,513
<i>Look at this.</i>

62
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,860
-Now you say go.
-Go!

63
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,655
Smash.

64
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,393
All right, squeeze in.

65
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,901
You know, you can't do this every morning.
it’s way too corny.

66
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,630
Come on. Smile.

67
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:08,732
it’s just till he's 18.

68
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,871
-A present.
-Oh, great. What's that?

69
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,381
You hate brushing your teeth
and that brushes them in 30 seconds.

70
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,611
l love brushing my teeth.
Don't believe everything your mother says.

71
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,245
-What time's your last class?
-3:00.

72
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,551
But l got some papers to grade.
Can you pick up Luke?

73
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,059
After yesterday,
l probably don't have a job anyway, so.. .

74
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,357
Was it wrong of me
to call her a useless cow?

75
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,696
l think bosses admire
that kind of frank exchange.

76
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,197
-Did you call your dad?
-When?

77
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,869
Birthday, yesterday!

78
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:44,340
Yeah, l sent him some freshly cut flowers,
little pink roses.

79
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,036
l sent him a handmade card.

80
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:49,046
And l finished that quilt l've been sewing
since spring.

81
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,173
You are completely impossible.

82
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,651
Did you notice what l got for my birthday
this year? l got a grunt.

83
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,985
Mom said, ''Happy birthday, sweetheart,''
and Dad went.. .

84
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,616
it was just.. . it was a beautiful moment
in my life. l teared up.

85
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,521
Ever think that somebody has to be
the bigger person here?

86
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,121
Now l want you to remember this
for the custody hearing,

87
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,292
how Mommy is always
scolding Daddy, okay?

88
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,460
Can you remember that?

89
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,832
You know, how are you goanna feel

90
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,338
when Luke grows up
and doesn't call you on your birthday?

91
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,305
And now she's trying to drive a wedge
between us.

92
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,276
-l give up.
-And now she's abandoning you.

93
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,576
Hey, buddy, do you wanna try
and knock him over again?

94
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,053
You ready? Line it up.

95
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,026
-Line it up now and you say go.
-Go!

96
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,260
l got it.

97
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,001
Pittsburgh Police.
This is an arrest warrant for Lara Brennan.. .

98
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,162
-Arrest for what?
-.. .and a search warrant for the premises.

99
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,364
-Hold on!
-Lara Brennan?

100
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,533
-You touch me again, l'm goanna arrest you.
-Hold on.

101
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,008
-Stay where you are!
-This is my house!

102
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,169
-Lara Brennan?
-Yes!

103
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,246
l will arrest you.

104
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,144
You're under arrest for the murder
of Elizabeth Gesas.

105
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,716
-Calm down!
-l got my kid in the kitchen!

106
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,284
What are you doing?
Arrest her for what?

107
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,319
-Turn around!
-Mommy!

108
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,820
-John! John!
-You have the right to an attorney.. .

109
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,355
Go get Luke. Go get Luke.

110
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,424
-.. understand these rights.. .
-Luke!

111
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,083
it’s okay, buddy! it’s okay!

112
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,322
-Mommy!
-Luke!

113
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,689
it’s all right. it’s okay!

114
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,976
<i>Daddy! Daddy!</i>

115
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,174
-Daddy!
-What's wrong? What's wrong, buddy?

116
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,249
What's wrong?

117
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,752
l got you.

118
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,554
Well, you can stay in here

119
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:51,535
as long as you sleep on this side of the bed,
all right?

120
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,075
You little snake.

121
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:02,236
l don't know why l keep falling
for the same old trick.

122
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,648
You have your tricks, don't you?

123
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,845
Hey, go to sleep.

124
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,718
Go to sleep.

125
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:31,238
-But Sam is your friend, right?
-Not at lunch.

126
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,274
-Why, does he steal your food?
-No.

127
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,111
-Did he say something mean? About Mom?
-Yeah.

128
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,790
-Did you hit him?
-Yeah.

129
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,292
Good. Where'd you hit him?

130
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,090
On the playground.

131
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,492
Wow! That must have hurt.

132
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,627
Hold it there, son.

133
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,409
it’s a toy.

134
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,151
Thank you.

135
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,417
Hey. All right.

136
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,493
And the other arm.

137
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,589
Don't worry about the car.
We'll get it back later, okay?

138
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,341
Hey!

139
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,864
Hi, honey!

140
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,026
Hey.

141
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,233
You won't give Mommy a kiss?

142
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,871
Can Mommy please have a kiss?

143
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,273
Rat-bag. Give your mom a kiss.

144
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,408
-ls Daddy reading you my letters?
-Every night at bedtime.

145
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,676
Yeah?

146
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,287
You smell so good.

147
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,222
What are you goanna build today?

148
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,120
You goanna build a fort?

149
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,567
A door? Or a castle?

150
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,733
Hey.

151
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,250
Was he scared going to school?

152
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,754
No. l walked him to his class,
gave him a kiss, he just walked right in.

153
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,382
Didn't even turn back for a wave.

154
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,099
Look at his friends!

155
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,767
And his desk.

156
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,775
-How was your first day?
-Excellent.

157
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,118
Half the class stayed awake, you know.

158
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,053
-l talked to your mom.
-When is she coming?

159
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,552
She's having a lot of trouble
with her business, so.. .

160
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:43,594
Well, it's only been a couple of years,
l'm sure she'll get around to it.

161
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,507
Have you heard anything?

162
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,475
About the appeal?

163
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,545
Yeah, and l've just decided not to tell you.

164
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,104
-Remember what Meyer said.
-Don't.

165
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,241
it can take months for a court
to make a ruling.

166
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:03,412
l saw that woman. She was there.
She couldn't have just disappeared.

167
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:04,989
Meyer is looking for a new investigator.

168
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:08,026
Her coat snagged my purse,
and l felt that button pop,

169
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,651
and they're blind if they can't find it.

170
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,731
He's goanna go through
all the evidence again.

171
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,829
That's great,
because we're not quite bankrupt yet.

172
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,494
We're fine.

173
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,498
How you just lie and lie.

174
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,743
But you're so handsome.

175
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,279
Can you do me a favour?

176
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:34,511
l don't know, l'm kind of busy.

177
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,118
l need you to run for governor.

178
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,450
l can do that.

179
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,787
You can change this rule
about no conjugal visits,

180
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,989
'cause l don't think
l can last another 20 years.

181
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:46,353
Hey.

182
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,034
l'm okay.

183
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,109
-l'm okay.
-Everything is goanna be all right.

184
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,468
l promise.

185
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,081
You think he'll ever kiss me again?

186
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,066
l need you to stand up.

187
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,576
Tag, you're it.

188
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,353
Tag, you're it.

189
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,426
Luke! Let's go, yard ape.

190
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:00,731
Hey.

191
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,064
-Have fun?
-Yeah.

192
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,143
She's kind of crazy, that little girl, right?

193
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,503
Time to go, Carrie!

194
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,108
No!

195
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:48,209
He didn't even read the thing. Half the time,
l'm telling you.. . We'll get him in there.

196
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,490
What happens if we find the woman
who was leaving the parking lot?

197
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,461
The PCRA has been rejected.

198
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,229
No new evidence can be submitted.
Not anymore.

199
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,363
it was a robbery.

200
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,499
And if they had used her credit card,
we could have argued that.

201
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,270
l'm.. . l'm sorry.

202
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,542
John.. .

203
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,972
This sucks.

204
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,476
Okay. That's that.

205
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,925
All we have now
is the Supreme Court, right?

206
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:37,822
John, in the last 30 years,

207
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,398
the Supreme Court
has not heard one murder case.

208
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,527
No decent lawyer
would even file the pleadings.

209
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:52,906
So, all l have to do is find an indecent one?
That shouldn't be too hard.

210
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,640
l'll file it.

211
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:02,178
But l need you to do something for me.

212
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,082
What?

213
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:09,516
l need you to look at the evidence
and forget that Lara's your wife.

214
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,161
l've seen the evidence, Meyer.

215
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:17,463
l'm not saying judge her innocent or guilty,
l'm just saying look at it.

216
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,835
Her co-worker sees her leaving the scene,

217
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:26,001
the victim's blood is on her clothes,
her fingerprints are on the murder weapon.

218
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,135
And then we went out to dinner.

219
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,112
How do you do that
if you just killed somebody?

220
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,307
That would make her a psychopath.

221
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,214
-And the fight.. .
-ls Lara a psychopath?

222
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,445
-The fight in the office?
-Everyone fights with their boss!

223
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,647
But this one ended up dead.

224
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,224
So what you're saying is that
you never believed in her innocence?

225
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,158
-How can you say that?
-What are you saying, Meyer?

226
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,289
l'm saying that it no longer matters
what we believe,

227
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,731
Lara is not getting out!

228
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,972
And you have no idea
how much l hate to say that.

229
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,941
l will find someone to file the pleadings.

230
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,019
John.

231
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,411
John, come on. John!

232
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:11,949
John!

233
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,050
John! For Christ's sakes!

234
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,287
Come on.

235
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,416
We'll find Scout, okay?

236
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,374
Thank you.

237
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:32,124
''And give a big hug to Penguin,
Little Penguin, Kiki and Opossumy.

238
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,058
''Lots and lots of love, Mommy.' '

239
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,298
Should we write her back?

240
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:41,430
Can l have a quarter?

241
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,568
Can you have a quarter?

242
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:50,173
Yeah, but you know you can't spend these.

243
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,808
Because they come from the cottage
where Mom and l used to take you

244
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,716
when you were a baby.

245
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,280
Then can l have them all?

246
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:00,651
Sure.

247
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,709
My wife, Lara Brennan,
she was sent up here.

248
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:29,275
-Brennan, B-R-E-N-N-A-N.
-l'm sorry, but she can't have visitors.

249
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,650
That's ridiculous. l have to see her.

250
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,189
-Lara! Lara!
-l'm sorry.

251
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,258
You can't go down there!

252
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,160
-You can't be in here!
-Hey, hey, stop. Stop right there.

253
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:37,558
-Where you going? Hey, come back here.
-Lara!

254
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,153
-Lara!
-Sir!

255
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:40,959
-What the hell is going on?
-My wife attempted suicide.

256
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,499
They brought her up here.
l have to see her, please.

257
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,466
-She's not allowed visitors.
-So why isn't she in the ER?

258
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,470
-Because she's a transfer from County Jail.
-Just two minutes, please.

259
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,900
Two minutes.

260
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,406
Okay.

261
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,249
Thank you.

262
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,525
Two minutes.

263
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:49,226
<i>So, The Life and Times of Don Quixote.</i>

264
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,133
What is it about?

265
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:56,901
That someone's belief in virtue
is more important than virtue itself?

266
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:01,310
<i>Yes, that's in there. But what is it about?</i>

267
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:08,576
Could it be about
how rational thought destroys your soul?

268
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:14,952
Could it be about the triumph of irrationality
and the power that's in that?

269
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,954
You know, we spend a lot of time
trying to organize the world.

270
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:23,057
<i>We build clocks and calendars
and we try and predict the weather.</i>

271
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:29,670
But what part of our life
is truly under our control?

272
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:49,124
<i>What if we choose to exist purely
in a reality of our own making?</i>

273
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,121
<i>Does that render us insane?</i>

274
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,137
And if it does,
isn't that better than a life of despair?

275
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:19,486
it’s a course that investigates what
drives men to be free, no matter the cost.

276
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,557
<i>Some other teacher had dibs on Papillion?</i>

277
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,522
You escaped from jail seven times.

278
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,565
What do you want to know?

279
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,104
How you escaped when no one else could.

280
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,401
Balls and a little luck.

281
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,733
No prison in the world is airtight.

282
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,506
Each one has a key. You just have to find it.

283
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,111
How do you do that?

284
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,374
A lot of looking.

285
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,752
Especially at things
that break up the daily routine.

286
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:52,787
Guards get comfortable
doing the same thing day in, day out.

287
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,485
Something happens,
that's when they make mistakes.

288
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:58,392
When you see it, you have to be ready.

289
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,931
You have to have the entire plan
already in place,

290
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,899
even before you know
how you're going to get out of jail.

291
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,096
Escaping is easy,
the hardest part is staying free.

292
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:12,033
You have to know where you're goanna go
and how you're goanna get there.

293
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:15,909
You have to know how they plan
to catch you, where and when.

294
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,845
Well, how the hell
are you supposed to know that?

295
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,009
You pay off someone who knows.

296
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,883
And a lot depends on
if the prison is in the country or the city.

297
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,047
City.

298
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,560
Where are you from?

299
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,069
Pittsburgh.

300
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,237
Pittsburgh's tough.

301
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,306
<i>So many bridges and tunnels
they can block off.</i>

302
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,777
<i>From the time they make the call,</i>

303
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,877
<i>the police can have the centre of the city
sealed tight in 15 minutes.</i>

304
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,455
How can they be so exact?

305
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,993
<i>After 9l1 1, Homeland Security
made every city have a lockdown plan.</i>

306
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:06,587
Downtown Pittsburgh, Philly, Boston,
Minneapolis, 15 minutes.

307
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,897
They can do D.C . in under 10.

308
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,096
<i>Within 35 minutes, they can have cops
at every tollbooth on the interstate</i>

309
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:15,968
<i>and be running rolling stops
on the secondary roads.</i>

310
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,702
<i>They won't have your photograph yet,
but they will have your description.</i>

311
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,807
What if you can't get out?
Thirty-five minutes is not a lot of time.

312
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:23,903
Then surrender.

313
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:28,452
Because they will shoot you on sight,
along with anyone else you're with.

314
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,419
Stay far away
from the train and bus stations.

315
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:34,218
<i>Forget the local airports.
Leave from another state.</i>

316
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,120
Second, identity.
it’s easy to find fake papers,

317
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,959
harder to find ones
that will get you through an airport.

318
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:45,503
You'll need a passport, a driver's license
and a social security number.

319
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,005
lf you have to rent a car,
find a place that will take a cash deposit.

320
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,472
They'll still run a credit check,
so use a real person's name on the lD.

321
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:55,205
Third, destination.

322
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,372
<i>You want somewhere
that doesn't attract American tourists.</i>

323
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:01,074
Think Yemen, and you get the idea.

324
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,351
And money, you'll need a truckload of it.

325
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,914
Everything's expensive,
hotels, travel, information.

326
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,784
How much?

327
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,124
<i>Enough to last at least five, six years.</i>

328
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:15,364
You run out of money,
you run out of friends.

329
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:23,396
But before you do anything,
you have to ask yourself if you can do it.

330
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:26,538
Can you forget about ever seeing
your parents again?

331
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,376
Can you kill a guard?
Leave your kid at a gas station?

332
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,716
Push some nice old lady to the ground

333
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,842
just because she gets
between you and the door?

334
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:38,582
Because to do this thing,
that's who you have to become.

335
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,522
And if you can't, don't start,

336
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,492
'cause you'll just get someone killed.

337
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,333
How did you get caught?

338
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:54,299
l gave myself up.

339
00:27:55,807 --> 00:28:00,608
l couldn't take wondering when someone
was goanna come through the bedroom door.

340
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,777
So, what do you have in your pocket?

341
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,326
Good luck.

<i>Each one has a key. You just have to find it.</i>

344
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,101
<i>How do you do that?</i>

345
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:39,437
<i>A lot of looking.</i>

346
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:42,342
<i>Especially at things
that break up the daily routine.</i>

347
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:57,992
<i>And on the left, the Allegheny County Jail,
now the largest jail in the world.</i>

Hey, l need some passports.

Piss off, man! Beat your feet.

Okay, boy!

370
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,405
You got to pay upfront for the passports, yo.

-l can do that.
-You know the Hotel Lafayette?

372
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:40,017
it’s on Main Street. When you get there,
go to the bar, ask for Harv.

What's your name?

374

-Are you Harv?
-Yeah.

377
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:23,032
Mouss told me to come and see you.

378
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,962
He did, did he? What do you want?

379
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:32,776
Three passports, a driver's license,
and a real social security number.

380
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,412
How do you know Mouss?

381
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,077
He babysits my kid.

382

lf l ever see your face again,
you're goanna lose an eye.

386
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:59,430
Yeah, it was stupid. l fell off the bike.

387
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,663
You mean the bike that's been in our garage
for two years?

388
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,599
Put your head back.

389
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,740
Some guy made a crack about Lara.

390
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:14,076
So that's what you do now? You punch
everybody who thinks she's guilty?

391
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:15,668
What's that supposed to mean?

392
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,044
it means it's important what you believe,

393
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:19,639
-not what somebody else.. .
-Really?

394
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,218
-Do you believe, Mom?
-Why are you trying to start a fight?

395
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,912
Come on, buddy. Let's go. Where's his bag?

396
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:26,182
-Why are you doing this?
-No reason.

397
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,848
l just stupidly thought that the people
who loved her

398
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,325
would actually believe she's innocent.
My mistake.

399
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:31,452
Stop this!

400
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,969
Go give Grandma a kiss.

401
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,004
Come on.

402
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,302
Does your face hurt?

403
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,337
A little.

404
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,275
Did you hit him back?

405
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,472
No, l.. . l didn't.

406
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,707
That's okay.

407
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,018
Okay, buddy?

408
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,492
l'm looking for someone
who does high-end lDs.

409
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,720
Passports, social security cards.

410
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,489
Get out of here.

411

00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,190
What do you need?

415
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,563
Passports, driver's license,

$3,700.

418
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,241
That's too much.

419
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,738
it is if you never get them.

420
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:41,277
l need photos and $1,000 in advance.

421
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,892
-l'll bring them Wednesday.
-Hey, not here.

422
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,001
l don't want you coming back here again.

423
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:08,543
Parking lot of Don's. Eckert Street.
Under the bridge, 2:00.

424
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,779
lf l'm not there on time, leave.

425
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,424
Put your thumb right there.

426
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,732
-Thanks. That's all l need.
-Thank you.

427
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,768
l'll just be a few moments.

428
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,877
Glasses?

429
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:19,976
Yes.

430
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:24,318
Yeah, l found myself falling asleep
grading papers.

431
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,616
When?

432
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,683
l guess about a year ago.

433
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,952
A year ago.

434
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:38,494
Look at you.
How can you do this to yourself?

435
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,369
l am hopeless without my wife.

436
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,101
l can't even ride a bike.

437
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:49,973
Sorry about the house.

438
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,353
l won't know where to picture you.

439
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:04,284
l close my eyes, l see Luke in his bedroom,
and you on the sofa by the window.

440
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,632
l won't know where to picture you anymore.

441
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,080
Show me where the bullets go.

442
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:31,788
Hi, it's John.

443
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,214
Luke's not feeling too well.

444
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,589
So l'm goanna pick him up
and take him home, okay?

445
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:39,686

446
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,159
Thanks.

447
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:28,573
<i>You ever goanna answer
your goddamn phone?</i>

448
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,545
You were supposed to leave.

l need them.

450
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:42,489
You notice that guy was a cop?

451
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,721
Just give me the money.

452
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,110
You want this too much.

453
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,014
You're goanna fuck it up.

454
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,409
Hey, Mr. Brennan.

455
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:47,487
<i>Today l'm goanna show you
how to make a key that can open any lock.</i>

456
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:49,252
<i>it’s called a bump key.</i>

457
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,653
<i>First thing you need to do
is you need to find a key</i>

458
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:54,322
<i>that can fit into the type of lock
that you're trying to open.</i>

459
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,797
<i>Here l have a key
that fits into my front door,</i>

460
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,734
<i>but l just changed the locks,
so it won't open.</i>

461
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:03,466
<i>First thing you need to do
is secure your key,</i>

462
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:08,034
<i>take a metal file and go through and
start taking those mountains and valleys</i>

463
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,705
<i>all the way down
to the lowest possible setting on the key.</i>

464
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,339
<i>The bump key works
by momentarily bumping those pins up,</i>

465
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,542
<i>so that for a split second,</i>

466
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:19,180
<i>the chamber is cleared of pins
and thus, able to turn and open.</i>

467
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:21,511
-Here you go.
-Don't touch that.

468
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:23,743
-Sorry.
-Trying to do my job?

469
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:00,079
So you are where in here?

470
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,020
l'm in the middle there.

471
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:08,555
in the middle. Can you point to yourself?

472
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:10,218
That's me.

473
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:11,655
There.

474
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:18,526
So that's not you back there
by the elevators.

475
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,795
No, no, l was around here somewhere.

476
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:26,867
You wanna tell me what's going on?

477
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,305
You want me to tell you?

478
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,076
Yes.

479
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,883
Do you know what a bump key is?

480
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,183
Sorry?

481
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:49,523
lf this was you,

482
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,363
you might wanna think about
what's goanna happen to your kids

483
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,665
if both their parents end up in prison.

484
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,165
Dad?

485
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:11,068
Dad!

486
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:13,708
Yeah, bud.

487
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:15,973
Yeah.

488
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,343
Thanks.

489
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:26,780
So we arrested his wife, and now
we're goanna charge the man with vomiting.

490
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:30,723
He's selling the house. Or he has a buyer.

491
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:34,228
in this market? Lucky man.

492
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:38,127
Can we possibly go do police work now?

493
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:44,067
l don't know how you managed
to stay single this long.

494
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:59,549
Dad, can l have my cookies?

495
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:03,190
-You hungry? You want a sandwich?
-No.

496
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,563
-There you go.
-Thanks.

497
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,265
Carrie!

498
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:20,274
l'm sorry.
She's just already got it all figured out.

499
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:23,873
Nicole.

500
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:26,783
-l remember.
-Really?

501
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:30,147
l remember your daughter.

502
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,681
Well, she's hard to forget.

503
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:47,292
Luke was supposed to bring this home.

504
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,531
He has his father's memory.

505
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:54,740
it’s for Carrie's birthday party.
Please, come. l'd love to meet your wife.

506
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,876
She won't be there.

507
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:01,010
it’s complicated.

508
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,849
l understand. With me, too.

509
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:09,382
Carrie, come on, let's go.

510
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:13,952
We're goanna grab a bite to eat.
Would you like to come?

511
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:17,264
-No, l don't.. . We're kind of.. .
-Busy?

512
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:22,563
Come on. We owe you for the cookies.

513
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:26,132
Well, that's true.

514
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,611
And l did make those cookies myself.

515
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:30,703
And learned how to pre-package them.

516
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,580
Come on, Luke.

517
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:43,993
So, do you trade off time with Luke?

518
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:46,756
No, Luke and l are together full-time.

519
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:49,991
Wow. l guess that's why l see you so much.

520
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:54,292
She'd like nothing better than to be here,
with him.

521
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:57,601
Lara, she.. . She misses all this.

522
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:01,504
l guess it's all about priorities, isn't it?

523
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:08,774
No, she's not like that.

524
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:11,681
She's in prison.

525
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:18,026
-l don't tell most people.
-l understand.

526
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:19,857
She's innocent. She didn't kill that woman.

527
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,323
Good. l mean.. .

528
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,432
l'm sure she didn't.

529
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,538
We really should be going home.

530
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:32,835
Okay.

531
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:36,942
Thank you very much for the invitation.
We'll try and make it.

532
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,810
That would be great.

533
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:41,241
-Goodbye. Luke!
-Bye.

534
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:43,414
Come on.

535
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,621
Carrie, come on!

536
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,934
-Hey.
-Hey.

537
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:26,531
What's wrong?

538
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:29,610
What is it?

539
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:37,944
No.

540
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,513
No.

541
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,255
They can't move you without notice.

542
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,350
Three days isn't notice.

543
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:49,693
l was only here through the appeal.
We knew l was going to a prison.

544
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:57,901
No, no, l don't have two weeks.
l gotta close the escrow tomorrow.

545
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:00,805
Well, the title hasn't even been cleared yet.
l mean, there's no way l can.. .

546
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,104
How much can they give me?

547
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:03,636
Nothing!

548
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,302
What are you doing here?

549
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:36,036
l've got class.

550
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,010
You be good, okay?

551
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,177
Thanks.

552
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:01,223
Are you okay? You're okay?

553
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:02,662
-Are you okay?
-What are you doing?

554
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:03,925
You almost killed us!

555
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,091
l'm so, so sorry.

556
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:06,930
You're out of your mind. You don't look.

557
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:10,135
Get away. Get away from us!

558
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:45,666
Hey.

559
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:52,939
What's wrong?

560
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:54,016
Nothing.

561
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:55,781
ls it Luke?

562
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:57,318
-No.
-What?

563
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:03,848
l.. . l asked Meyer

564
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:06,895
to look into not having you moved.

565
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:12,857
l told him that travelling that distance
would be a hardship on us,

566
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:15,028
that Luke was already having problems
at school, which is true.

567
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:17,129
l haven't been spending
enough time with him.

568
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:19,072
You haven't?

569
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:20,501
No.

570
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:22,877
You haven't?

571
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:27,582
Jesus, John.

572
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:31,677
You really are too much.

573
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:36,624
Luke is having a hard time,
because Mommy's in jail for murder,

574
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:40,093
not because Daddy doesn't spend
enough time with him.

575
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,826
Your father was right. You really don't
live in the same world we do.

576
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:49,898
That's nice, that the two of you talk.

577
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:52,698
What world do l live in, Lara?

578
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:55,369
Well, l don't know, John,
but it's not the real one.

579
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:57,742
The one in which l'm in here
for the rest of my life.

580
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:01,442
So don't be talking to me about fantasies
like there's some happily ever.. .

581
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,241
We good here?

582
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:07,916
Yes. Sorry.

583
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:23,500
Now you're goanna sit here all long-faced,
like you let me down.

584
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:26,439
l mean, what do you want me to do here?
You want me to make you feel better?

585
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:27,736
Got it.

586
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:30,043
l'm sorry.

587
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:31,704
Now you're apologizing.

588
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:33,748
You really are a gem.

589
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:36,978
-What do you want from me, Lara?
-What do l want from you? Nothing.

590
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,781
You're already too perfect.

591
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:41,917
You know,
you never even asked me if l did it.

592
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:45,055
-lf l killed her.
-Because l know you didn't.

593
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:47,186
Well, then you'd be wrong.

594
01:03:01,244 --> 01:03:02,677
l'm done.

595
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,274
Sir, you can't stand there.

596
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:43,883
Sir, l need you to leave the building now.

597
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:45,712
Sir?

598
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:04,697
-What?
-Shut up.

599
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:09,373
l don't care what you say or how you say it.

600
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:12,705
l don't believe you did it.

601
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,212
And l never will.

602
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:22,623
l know who you are.

603
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:27,029
And l promise you

604
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,859
this will not be your life.

605
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:47,356
Shut up!

606
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:02,500
-l don't know what's going on, man.
-You done?

607
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:03,578
Everybody is out.

609
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:09,818
Back away! Back away!

01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:13,679
Drop the gun! Drop it!

611
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:15,421
Put the dog away!

612
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:16,855
You shoot the dog, l'll kill you!

613
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:20,120
-You want the police here, asshole?
-Good idea!

614
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:24,825

615
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,492
-You, too!
-l'm not getting in there!

-What do we have?
-A freaking miracle.

663
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:29,159
Meth lab in the basement,
the house still standing.

664
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:30,993
Should be just a crater.

665
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:32,191
We know him?

666
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:35,737
Alex Gaidar,
history of violence and drug trafficking.

667
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:46,743
He have a kid?

668
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:49,044
Neighbour said wife left with him last year.

669
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:51,214
Big surprise there.

670
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:53,247
And this blood,

01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:57,548

672
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:00,685
No, but someone left through
the back door bleeding.

673
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:04,425
Zone Three found a gunshot victim dead
on a transit bench.

674
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:51,713

688
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:48,693
We want to take him
to the Fall Festival in Kutztown

689
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:50,765

Bye.

697
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:05,198
You're getting sentimental in your old age.

698
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:07,335
Yeah.

699
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:12,172
Well, might as well have some coffee.

700
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:37,402
Yo! idiots!

701
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:43,537
Can l carry him?

702
01:19:44,045 --> 01:19:46,809
No, bud. Only what fits in the bag, all right?

703
01:19:52,654 --> 01:19:54,417
What about my pockets?

704
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:56,115
Or your pockets.

705
01:21:24,913 --> 01:21:25,880
Hello?

706
01:21:28,683 --> 01:21:29,877
Hello?

707
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:56,871
Bud? l'll be back in a moment, okay?

You all right?

712
01:22:39,754 --> 01:22:40,846
Yeah.

713
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:45,149
They're calling all the party animals.

714
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,993
922 Yetta Street.

715
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:49,864

716
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:52,389
Okay? Here we go.

717
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:14,450
Yeah, taillight matches
any 2004 to 2009 Prius.

718
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:17,220
What kind of criminal drives a Prius?

719
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:18,656
A socially responsible one.

720
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:22,590
There's over 1,000 registered in the city,
7,000 in the state.

721
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:26,256
-How many are registered to felons?
-Six in the state.

722
01:23:26,368 --> 01:23:30,668
Four to embezzlers, white-collar criminals,
one to a rapist, one to a murderer.

723
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:33,536
-Start with the murderer.
-She's in prison for life.

724
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:34,998
Rapist is out.

725
01:23:39,047 --> 01:23:40,309
Find him.

726
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:43,144
Come on.

727
01:23:48,256 --> 01:23:49,746
-Hello.

-Good to see you.
-it’s good to see you, too.

729
01:23:57,165 --> 01:23:59,690
-Hi, Luke.
-it’s a pony.

730
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:02,661
Those aren't easy to wrap.

731
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:08,103
-You know the party is not until 11 :00, right?
-Really?

732
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:13,609
What is it? Around 9:00? l'm sorry.
l should've read it more carefully.

733
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:17,207
it’s no problem.
Why don't you go give this to Carrie?

734
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:22,013
Well, l guess you can help.

735
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:24,382
Actually, l've gotta go
and run some errands.

736
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:26,460
Sorry.

737
01:24:29,864 --> 01:24:31,126
We'll see you later then.

738
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:34,125
Thanks so much.

739
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:41,739
He has my parents' phone number.

740
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:45,240
in his jacket. Top pocket of his jacket.

741
01:24:48,016 --> 01:24:49,813
lf l'm running late.

742
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:51,984
No problem.

743
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:05,797
The rapist is in a wheelchair.
Not sure if that was karma or just bad luck.

744
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:08,061
The murderer. Where is she incarcerated?

745
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:09,693
County, right here in town.

746
01:25:09,804 --> 01:25:13,171
Does she have a husband
or a kid old enough to drive?

747
01:25:27,355 --> 01:25:28,754
Yes? What?

748
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:31,383
Lara Brennan's blood work.

749
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:35,993
Get the lab.

750
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:45,603
You pissed somebody off, that's for sure.

751
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:53,504
-it’s still busy. l'll keep trying.
-No. Get an ambulance.

752
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:57,543
Take her to University Hospital.
l'll meet them there.

753
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,347
Right. Thanks.

754
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,116
Husband, schoolteacher.

755
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:05,883
You got a home address?

756
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,927
No car in the garage.
You want to get a warrant?

757
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:16,155
Yeah.

758
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:47,726
Get the warrant.

759
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:33,668
Lara Brennan's being transferred
to University Hospital.

760
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:35,174
-Right now?
-Right now.

761
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,505
Have them call the escort vehicle.

762
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:39,512
Tell them we'll meet them at the hospital
in less than 10.

763
01:28:43,951 --> 01:28:47,910
Yeah. Yeah, we're here.
Prisoner's secure. No problems.

764
01:28:49,457 --> 01:28:50,719
Will do.

765
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:53,360
Hands where l can see 'me.

766
01:28:53,795 --> 01:28:54,762
John?

767
01:28:54,862 --> 01:28:56,090
And the phone.

768
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:57,557
What are you doing here, John?

769
01:28:57,665 --> 01:28:58,859
Put your hands on your head.

770
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:01,065
John, what are you doing?

771
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:03,404
Uncuff her. Kneel down.

772
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:06,934
John, stop this.

773
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:09,339
Kneel down. Face the wall.

774
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:16,677
<i>Unit 2242 secure.</i>

775
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:19,316
-She just said.. .
-Just take the light.

776
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:26,451
Hands and feet, pull 'me as tight as you can.

777
01:29:26,561 --> 01:29:29,860
You walk out that door with him,
you will both be dead.

778
01:29:29,964 --> 01:29:31,363
-Shut up.
-John, he's right.

779
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:33,764
Listen to him. You're goanna get us killed.

780
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:36,359
-Why are you doing this?
-Because we have no other choice!

781
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:37,836
-Put 'me on.
-No. That's not true!

782
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:39,201
-Put the clothes on, Lara.
-No.

783
01:29:39,307 --> 01:29:40,740
-Now!
-No!

784
01:29:41,743 --> 01:29:42,732
Okay.

785
01:29:43,444 --> 01:29:46,504
You call your son
and tell him you're not coming.

786
01:29:46,614 --> 01:29:47,842
-Where is he?
-He's waiting for you.

787
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:49,177
You wanna tell him you're not coming?

788
01:29:49,617 --> 01:29:51,346
-How can you do this to me?
-Push ''send.' '

789
01:29:51,452 --> 01:29:52,783
Tell him l'm not coming, either.

790
01:29:53,554 --> 01:29:55,920
-John.
-Does it look like l'm going home, Lara?

791
01:29:56,758 --> 01:30:01,627
You call him, tell him he's alone now
and his mom and dad are not coming back.

792
01:30:03,364 --> 01:30:04,831
Jesus, John.

793
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,997

We have units at every exit, John.
You will be shot trying to leave.

804
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:27,347
Hit the button, Lara.

805
01:31:27,448 --> 01:31:28,915
-Stop.
-Hit the button!

806
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:30,779

-Where are the stairs?
-There.

823
01:33:22,830 --> 01:33:23,819

They're on the platform!

837
01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:20,306
Block stations in either directions!
Call the Port Authority. Stop all the trains!

838
01:35:35,429 --> 01:35:36,953
Wait, wait, wait.

839

What are we doing?

840
01:35:43,037 --> 01:35:45,835
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors, please.</i>

841
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:51,075

Red light!

851
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:33,066
Ring the city. Close bus and train stations.

852
01:38:33,173 --> 01:38:35,232
And get their description
to the state police.

853
01:38:35,342 --> 01:38:36,309
<i>Copy that.</i>

854
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:38,742
-How old is their damn kid?
-Six.

01:38:39,213 --> 01:38:41,113
Find out where he is.

856
01:38:46,053 --> 01:38:48,214
-Why didn't you tell me?
-You would've stopped me.

857
01:38:49,657 --> 01:38:51,420
Your insulin is in here.

858
01:38:51,525 --> 01:38:54,050
There's a case in here.
it’s got a brush, moisturizer, makeup.

859
01:38:54,161 --> 01:38:57,096
Everything you had was old.
l hope l got it right.

860
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:09,373
You remember where you last saw him?

861
01:39:09,476 --> 01:39:12,445
You want to take a guess
who just escaped from jail?

862
01:39:12,546 --> 01:39:13,570
Hold on a second.

863
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:22,020

865
01:39:24,925 --> 01:39:26,449
Back from where?

866
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,050
From the zoo.

867
01:39:31,265 --> 01:39:32,459
it’s a zoo party.

868
01:39:34,101 --> 01:39:37,127
They should be back in about an hour
if you'd like to wait.

869
01:39:37,237 --> 01:39:38,727
No. Thank you.

870
01:39:43,210 --> 01:39:45,235
What's wrong? What is it?

871
01:39:46,447 --> 01:39:48,881
-Where is he? Where's Luke?
-He's at the party.

872
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:50,780
What party? You said the party was here.

873
01:39:50,884 --> 01:39:53,717
l was wrong. She's taken them to the zoo.

874
01:39:55,723 --> 01:39:58,715
<i>-Destination, Pittsburgh Zoo.
-She?</i>

875
01:39:59,259 --> 01:40:02,888
<i>Estimated drive time, 17 minutes.</i>

876
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:04,965
Carrie's mother, Nicole.

877
01:40:26,387 --> 01:40:27,547
Check the neighbours!

878
01:40:27,654 --> 01:40:30,885
We're looking for the boy and anything
they've noticed in the last few days.

879
01:41:38,725 --> 01:41:41,751
<i>Time to destination, 11 minutes.</i>

880
01:41:48,735 --> 01:41:51,670
<i>in 1,000 feet, bear left.</i>

881
01:41:57,978 --> 01:42:01,470
<i>in 500 feet, bear left.</i>

882
01:42:07,988 --> 01:42:10,980
<i>in 100 feet, bear left.</i>

883
01:42:14,895 --> 01:42:16,260
<i>Bear left.</i>

884
01:42:24,271 --> 01:42:26,364
You took the wrong turn.

885
01:42:26,473 --> 01:42:28,236
John, the zoo's behind us.
You took the wrong turn.

886
01:42:28,342 --> 01:42:29,331
Babe, what are you doing?

887
01:42:29,443 --> 01:42:30,467
She'll call my parents.

888
01:42:30,944 --> 01:42:32,434
-What?
-They'll look after him,

889
01:42:32,546 --> 01:42:34,377
and l'll figure out a way of getting him to us.

890
01:42:34,481 --> 01:42:35,573
Are you out of your mind?

891
01:42:35,682 --> 01:42:37,081
l tried! There's no more time!

892
01:42:37,184 --> 01:42:39,118
Any second now,
there's goanna be a roadblock ahead of us.

893
01:42:39,219 --> 01:42:42,450
it might be there now!
lf we don't get out now, we don't get out!

894
01:42:42,556 --> 01:42:45,923
l'll find a way of getting him to us, all right?
l'll find a way.

895
01:46:16,603 --> 01:46:19,766
No, really, it's fine. l just can't thank you
enough for taking care of him.

896
01:46:19,873 --> 01:46:21,033
Hey, it was our pleasure.

897
01:46:48,468 --> 01:46:49,560
Hi.

898
01:47:22,302 --> 01:47:24,668
l'm going to sit back here, okay?

899
01:47:26,706 --> 01:47:27,673
Sure.

900
01:48:09,616 --> 01:48:11,982
<i>The traffic is backing up at the toll plazas.</i>

901
01:48:12,085 --> 01:48:14,781
<i>it’s worse downtown where police
have cordoned off the train station</i>

902
01:48:14,888 --> 01:48:16,685
<i>and are searching all passengers.</i>

903
01:48:16,790 --> 01:48:19,657
<i>Joining us from Union Station,
our very own Sylvia Patterson.</i>

904
01:48:19,759 --> 01:48:20,726
John?

905
01:48:25,699 --> 01:48:27,564
What are we goanna do?

906
01:48:37,878 --> 01:48:40,312
We're going to the train station.

907
01:49:22,322 --> 01:49:24,187
-Stay in the car.
-Okay.

908
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:12,600
Sir, l'm sorry the mayor was delayed,
but l did not tell them to stop every vehicle.

909
01:50:12,706 --> 01:50:15,470
Just the ones with a couple and a child.

910
01:50:16,009 --> 01:50:17,670
Sir, l know my.. .

911
01:50:19,212 --> 01:50:20,543
Yes, sir.

912
01:50:58,485 --> 01:51:03,013
Are you sure $20 is enough?
Ticket to Buffalo costs three times that.

913
01:51:04,090 --> 01:51:07,150
Yeah. We're going that way anyway.

914
01:52:08,254 --> 01:52:12,953
Go wider. Send their photos to every train,
bus station and airport in a 300-mile radius.

915
01:52:13,059 --> 01:52:15,857
So Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia,

916
01:52:15,962 --> 01:52:19,659
New York, New Jersey, Virginia, Michigan,
Kentucky and Indiana?

917
01:52:20,266 --> 01:52:22,427
You know what direction they're going in,
smart-ass?

918
01:52:33,546 --> 01:52:36,014
-See you again, Tom.
-Thanks again.

919
01:52:50,130 --> 01:52:51,154
You want to see it?

920
01:52:51,464 --> 01:52:53,193
Only if it will tell me where they are.

921
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:54,990
Not so lucky.

922
01:53:16,055 --> 01:53:18,683
Excuse me. Do you call this coffee?

923
01:53:26,933 --> 01:53:28,958
How many airports in Ontario and Quebec?

924
01:53:29,068 --> 01:53:31,036
You want me to stop calling and count?

925
01:53:33,072 --> 01:53:35,939
-Long way to go with just a carry-on.
-l'm sorry?

926
01:53:36,042 --> 01:53:38,306
Long way to go with just a carry-on.

927
01:53:39,979 --> 01:53:43,312
You know how many times
you guys have lost our bags?

928
01:53:44,284 --> 01:53:47,014
Here's your tickets and boarding passes.

929
01:53:48,054 --> 01:53:49,282
Thank you.

930
01:53:52,458 --> 01:53:53,618
They found the parents.

931
01:54:18,051 --> 01:54:21,509
You decided to go for a drive
for the entire day?

932
01:54:21,955 --> 01:54:24,219
George wanted to see the leaves.

933
01:54:39,739 --> 01:54:42,640
And you have absolutely no idea
where they're going, right?

934
01:54:42,742 --> 01:54:44,835
l told you. We never spoke.

935
01:55:12,805 --> 01:55:13,829
Hey.

936
01:55:16,242 --> 01:55:17,709
l'll do this.

937
01:55:28,121 --> 01:55:29,452
Go ahead, Luke.

938
01:55:32,292 --> 01:55:33,259
Hello.

939
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:49,900
You look like you need to get away.

940
01:56:00,286 --> 01:56:01,617
Thank you.

941
01:56:03,856 --> 01:56:05,414
Come on, buddy.

942
01:56:35,822 --> 01:56:38,655
-Too bad you didn't find more of it.
-Yeah.

943
01:56:39,759 --> 01:56:42,057
And l wish l could figure out where this is.

944
01:56:42,829 --> 01:56:45,821
l checked Web sites for every
tourist destination l could think of.

945
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:49,430
-That's the Presidential Palace.
-What?

946
01:56:49,535 --> 01:56:52,834
it was all over CNN
when it collapsed during the earthquake.

947
01:56:56,509 --> 01:56:58,136
We know where they're going!

948
01:56:58,244 --> 01:56:59,472
Show me.

949
01:57:00,613 --> 01:57:04,208
<i>Thank you for waiting.
We'll soon begin boarding by rows.</i>

950
01:57:07,820 --> 01:57:10,414
Hold them at the gate. Take a look.

951
01:57:11,758 --> 01:57:13,055
Let's go!

952
01:57:34,514 --> 01:57:36,641
Excuse me, folks. No one else on.

953
01:57:37,316 --> 01:57:40,444
Excuse me, folks. Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.

954
01:57:58,671 --> 01:58:01,401
Sorry. There's no one by that description
on this flight.

955
01:58:01,707 --> 01:58:03,299
No. They're on it.

956
01:58:03,409 --> 01:58:04,603
<i>Do you have the photographs?</i>

957
01:58:04,710 --> 01:58:07,042
We have the photographs.
They're not on this plane.

958
01:58:09,682 --> 01:58:11,980
Are there any other flights to Haiti tonight?

959
01:58:12,085 --> 01:58:13,848
<i>Are there any other flights to Haiti tonight?</i>

960
01:58:16,289 --> 01:58:18,189
No other flights. Anything else?

961
01:58:24,330 --> 01:58:26,958
No. No. Thank you.

962
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:32,235
it’s starting to rain.

963
01:58:37,076 --> 01:58:38,771
l'll call the FBl.

964
01:58:45,384 --> 01:58:49,548
You ever ask yourself
why we found this bag and not the others?

965
01:58:58,664 --> 01:59:00,962
<i>The captain has switched off
the seat belt light.</i>

966
01:59:01,067 --> 01:59:05,902
<i>Flight time to Caracas, Venezuela,
this evening is five hours and 32 minutes.</i>

967
01:59:06,005 --> 01:59:10,533
<i>While in your seat, the captain asks
that you keep your seat belt fastened.</i>

968
01:59:16,516 --> 01:59:18,313
This guy's a teacher?

969
01:59:18,951 --> 01:59:20,851
At a community college.

970
02:01:00,886 --> 02:01:02,080
Hey!

971
02:03:06,245 --> 02:03:08,873
-She heard a button pop.
-What?

972
02:03:15,121 --> 02:03:17,021
She heard a button pop.

973
02:03:24,697 --> 02:03:27,257
Was it raining when we searched the scene?

974
02:03:27,366 --> 02:03:28,731
Three years ago?

975
02:03:28,968 --> 02:03:30,902
What are we doing here?

976
02:03:57,096 --> 02:03:59,963
Why don't you act like a cop?
Grab the other side.

977
02:04:00,065 --> 02:04:01,259
You're out of your mind.

978
02:04:03,636 --> 02:04:05,331
-Ready?
-Yeah.

979
02:04:09,141 --> 02:04:10,165
You got it?

980
02:04:25,491 --> 02:04:27,425
You really thought you were goanna find it?
