1
00:01:36,246 --> 00:01:37,838
Bull's-eye.

2
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:42,546
- It's dead as a doornail around here.
- Yeah.

3
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:46,483
How about seeing a picture, Rocky?
There's one at the Academy on 14th.

4
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:50,456
- Yeah, what?
- Covered Wagon. It's new, just come out.

5
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:53,289
- You got any dough?
- No. You got any?

6
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:54,760
No.

7
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:58,492
Oh, look. There's Rocky Sullivan.
Walk right by him like we don't see him.

8
00:01:58,668 --> 00:02:01,660
Hey, Rocky, there's Laury Martin coming.

9
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:03,099
So what?

10
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,437
Oh, my books, they're coming loose.

11
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,878
Say, that ain't a bad-looking doll,
that one in the middle.

12
00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:12,043
- The one with the pretzel legs.
- He means you, Laury.

13
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,343
- Why, the fresh...
- Don't be so smart-alecky, Rocky Sullivan.

14
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:18,681
- Go on. Beat it, pigtails.
- Trying to show off, ain't you?

15
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:22,450
- Scram, before I wipe the street with you.
- You better wipe your nose first.

16
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,890
- Is that so? I'll fix you.
- You better scram. You know the Rocky.

17
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,428
- Come on.
- Leave me alone, I can handle him.

18
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:31,965
Wait till I get down there. I'll fix you.

19
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,496
- I'll slap you down.
- Oh! Why, you, you...

20
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:37,663
Shut up.

21
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:40,469
Come on. Let's get out of here,
dig up some corn.

22
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:44,875
You won't get away with that, Rocky.
I'll get even someday. You just wait.

23
00:02:59,462 --> 00:03:02,022
Say, maybe this winter we can
hop a freight to Florida.

24
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:04,598
They say you can go swimming there,
even in January.

25
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,793
Sure, we can even hop one to California
if we wanted to.

26
00:03:07,971 --> 00:03:11,873
Look here, "Rubelin Coal Company,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania."

27
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:16,010
It's too bad it ain't winter. We could
grab a couple bags of those coals.

28
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:19,239
"Everwrite Fountain Pen Company."
I wonder what's in there.

29
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:20,882
Come on. Let's take a look.

30
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:27,019
It's loaded full of cases.
Fountain pens. Hundreds of them.

31
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:30,720
- We can break that easy.
- We shouldn't, we don't need those pens.

32
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:33,761
- It ain't like stealing coal to keep warm.
- We can sell them.

33
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,490
Now, listen.
What we don't take, we ain't got.

34
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,658
Look around. See what you can find
to break that lock.

35
00:03:58,254 --> 00:04:00,620
All right, whoever's in here,
come on out.

36
00:04:01,624 --> 00:04:02,989
Come on out, I say!

37
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:11,527
- What's the trouble?
- Just a couple of kids. I heard them.

38
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:13,066
Come on out of there.

39
00:04:13,736 --> 00:04:16,034
Come on, you hoodlums.
You won't get away.

40
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:20,567
- Come out, or I'll come in after you.
- Let's make a break for it, Jerry, now.

41
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:53,834
Come on, Rocky! Jump!

42
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:12,456
Hi, Snowflakes.

43
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,453
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hello.

44
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,962
What do you hear? What do you say?
Sit down.

45
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:19,567
- How they treating you, Rocky?
- Like a prince.

46
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,263
I get three square meals and real butter
on my bread. What a life.

47
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,371
- Is that a bad cut on your eye?
- Not bad. Just a few stitches.

48
00:05:27,543 --> 00:05:31,377
I thought you knocked your eye out.
You coming to my trial tomorrow?

49
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:35,216
Rocky, I've been worrying about
this all last night.

50
00:05:35,385 --> 00:05:39,048
- I can't let you take the whole blame.
- Pipe down, want the flapper to hear?

51
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:42,988
Now get this. You got away, didn't you?
Okay. I wanna be a sucker.

52
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:47,095
But, Rocky, maybe if they thought
I was in on it, they'd go easier on you.

53
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:52,428
In a pig's eye. Just because you can run
faster, you don't gotta eat yourself.

54
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:56,504
- But it ain't fair to you, Rocky.
- Look, so they send me up. So what?

55
00:05:56,672 --> 00:06:00,335
What've I got to lose? The old man's
got troubles enough without me. Forget it.

56
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,273
I got caught, and you got away.

57
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:06,905
But you, Rocky. Supposing I was the one
who got caught, you wouldn't keep quiet.

58
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,109
- You'd make them send you up too.
- What do you think I am?

59
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,948
- I'd lay dead just like you're gonna do.
- You would?

60
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:17,252
Sure. Always remember, don't be a sucker.

61
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:28,061
I'm pulling every string I can.
I'm seeing the right people.

62
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:32,725
- I can get you off with about three years.
- You talk like I can do it in a handstand.

63
00:07:32,902 --> 00:07:36,497
That ain't no picnic. You'll be outside
having it soft on cushions.

64
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:40,631
It's tough. I'm not gonna mark time.
I'll scout around, make connections.

65
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,836
- Not only for me, for both of us.
- Why should I take the fall?

66
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:46,140
There's no other way out. Be sensible.

67
00:07:46,315 --> 00:07:50,843
If they get me, I'll be disbarred. They'll
check my vault box and grab the 100 grand.

68
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:53,282
You don't want to lose that dough,
do you?

69
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,054
All right, Frazier.
It's my rap, and I'll take it...

70
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,526
...but it's my 100 grand, and I'll take
that, too, the day I get out. Look...

71
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:05,456
I know you're a smart lawyer,
very smart...

72
00:08:06,202 --> 00:08:07,965
...but don't get smart with me.

73
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,759
Very good, boys. That's all.

74
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:05,508
Wait till I get you outside, mug-face.
I'll immobilize you.

75
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:07,842
Yeah? You and your old maid!

76
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:21,490
Come in.

77
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:26,866
What's on your mind, son?

78
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:30,004
Not very much, Father. It's just been
bothering me for 15 years.

79
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:32,504
What did you do with those fountain pens
you stole?

80
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:34,643
- Rocky! You old...
- Jerry, glad to see you.

81
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,608
- What do you hear? What do you say?
- I'm glad to see you.

82
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,940
Good to see you.

83
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:40,581
Fifteen years.

84
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,879
Hasn't changed a bit.

85
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:45,748
- You remember Father Boyle's old sacristy.
- Remember it?

86
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:48,923
He used to stand right where you are
and boil the tar out of me.

87
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:53,494
Gosh, 15 years. It doesn't seem possible
I haven't seen you in that length of time.

88
00:11:53,662 --> 00:11:55,459
- I've seen you.
- You have? Where?

89
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,099
I was there when you made
the 90-yard run against NYU.

90
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:01,998
- Why didn't you come back and see me?
- Some people were waiting for me.

91
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:06,232
- Oh. Well, I got a kick coming, though.
- You have? What?

92
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:09,503
- Why haven't you written to me?
- You know how it is, Jerry.

93
00:12:09,678 --> 00:12:13,409
I changed my address and number
so often, you had no way to answer me.

94
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:17,348
You know what happens to letters
written in the stir. Everybody reads them.

95
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,045
When I was inside, nothing happened.
When I was out...

96
00:12:20,222 --> 00:12:22,349
...it was all there to read
on the front page.

97
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:25,085
Yes, I read all the papers.

98
00:12:25,394 --> 00:12:27,954
- You certainly make a good-looking priest.
- Thanks.

99
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,531
Your mother always wanted you to do it,
but what finally decided you?

100
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,635
Well, I was riding along on the top
of a bus...

101
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:38,262
...looking down, passing the cathedral.
- That gave you the idea, huh?

102
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:42,268
That's funny, I got an idea on the top
of a bus once. Got me six years.

103
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,745
I was around while you were
singing with the kids...

104
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:48,213
...and I kept thinking of you and me
20 years ago.

105
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:49,850
- With Father Boyle.
- Yeah.

106
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,647
Remember slipping "Merry Oldsmobile"
into the hymnbook?

107
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:55,313
- How could I forget it?
- How'd it go?

108
00:12:55,691 --> 00:13:00,287
Lead, kindly light
Amid the encircling gloom

109
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:04,661
Lead thou me on, for the night is dark
And I am far from...

110
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:08,668
- Did a lot of crazy things in those days.
- Certainly did. Certainly did.

111
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,431
Come in.

112
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:16,335
Father, you're supposed to be down at
the store. The fellas are waiting for you.

113
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:20,039
You run and tell them I'll be right over.
Tell them to get the game started.

114
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,343
- Okay, Father!
- All right.

115
00:13:22,518 --> 00:13:25,783
What's this store racket?
Got the kids shilling for the parish?

116
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:30,016
That's not a bad idea, Rocky.
No. It's a pet scheme of mine.

117
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:33,525
- A recreation spot for the kids.
- Kind of a kindergarten place, huh?

118
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:35,687
No, it's for the big fellas too.

119
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:39,992
You'd be surprised how tremendously it's
helped to keep the kids from becoming...

120
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:42,262
Hoodlums like me?

121
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:47,465
- You've cost me a lot of prayer.
- I've been in kind of a retreat myself.

122
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:52,046
- Yes. Will you be here for some time?
- Depends. I got a little business to attend.

123
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:55,081
- I gotta find a place to live.
- Get a room here in the parish.

124
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,847
- Not a bad idea. No place like home.
- Yes, and it's great to have you home.

125
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:04,690
- I came back to take a look at your kisser.
- Stick around and take a lot of them.

126
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:09,058
This is Maggione's. Go in and get a
furnished room. Remember her, don't you?

127
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:11,392
Took a lot of good lead pipe
out of that cellar.

128
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:15,162
Church is just around the corner.
I can drop in to see you from time to time.

129
00:14:15,538 --> 00:14:18,735
- See you at Mass Sunday?
- Sure. I'll help you with your collection.

130
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:20,876
- It's a deal.
- Fair enough.

131
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:30,751
- Mrs. Maggione at home?
- What do you want?

132
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,410
Looking for a room.

133
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:36,046
My mother ain't here, but the lady
in number two will show you the rooms.

134
00:14:39,194 --> 00:14:40,525
Yes?

135
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:43,259
Yes?

136
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:48,302
I'm looking for a room. Mrs. Maggione's
kid told me you'd take care of that.

137
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,563
Yes. I'll get the key.

138
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:02,711
Third floor.

139
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:10,121
There's something about your face
that looks awfully familiar.

140
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:13,750
- You've been looking at the funny papers.
- No, really.

141
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:17,865
Listen, sister, all I'm looking for
is a room.

142
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:23,466
Here it is.

143
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:32,475
Mrs. Maggione will give it
a good cleaning.

144
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,682
- It's all right. I've seen worse.
- I guess you have.

145
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,647
- I'll take the room. What's the tariff?
- Five dollars a week.

146
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:46,056
- Sold.
- In advance.

147
00:15:47,963 --> 00:15:49,294
All right.

148
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:52,067
Write me a receipt.

149
00:15:52,935 --> 00:15:55,062
You can trust me.

150
00:15:59,608 --> 00:16:01,542
How did you happen to come
to this house?

151
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,644
Looking for references, huh?

152
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:07,714
An old friend of mine sent me over here.
Jerry Connolly, the priest from the parish.

153
00:16:08,117 --> 00:16:09,948
- You know him?
- Father Jerry?

154
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:12,246
Yeah. Does that send me in?

155
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:18,086
Oh, I get it now. You're Rocky Sullivan.

156
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:20,655
- Yeah.
- Remember me?

157
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:22,723
- No.
- Laury Martin?

158
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:28,067
Laury Martin? That little fresh kid
with the pigtails?

159
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,297
Well, hello. What do you hear?
What do you say?

160
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:34,033
Hello.

161
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,347
- Hey! Wait a minute!
- I've waited 15 years to do that!

162
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,704
I wanna see Jim Frazier.

163
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:21,254
- I wanna see Frazier.
- He's busy.

164
00:17:21,423 --> 00:17:23,084
- I'll wait.
- Who are you?

165
00:17:23,258 --> 00:17:27,126
- Rocky Sullivan.
- Oh. Come on.

166
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,342
Number one. Clear the board.

167
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:52,209
Wait here.

168
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:02,664
- There's somebody to see you.
- Yeah? Who?

169
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,856
Rocky Sullivan.

170
00:18:05,934 --> 00:18:08,061
- Rocky Sullivan?
- Yeah.

171
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,539
- Does he know I'm here?
- Sure. Didn't you want me to tell him?

172
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:16,142
That's all right. Send him in.

173
00:18:22,217 --> 00:18:24,742
Well, well, Rocky! This is a surprise.

174
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,048
- What do you hear? What do you say?
- I had the date on the calendar.

175
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,715
I thought it was next month. Otherwise
I would've met you with a brass band.

176
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:35,693
I thought it was funny you didn't show,
but you've been busy the last three years.

177
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:38,862
You got a swell layout here.
Looks like you're in the dough.

178
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,731
- Yes, only... Well, you know Mac Keefer.
- Mac Keefer? Yeah, heard of him.

179
00:18:42,905 --> 00:18:46,705
- He owns the town. Can buy and sell it.
- Only he doesn't buy it. He sells it.

180
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,140
- That's soft, eh?
- Softer than that store cot...

181
00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:52,678
...I've been sleeping on
for the last three years.

182
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:55,076
- Well, you're out now, Rocky.
- Yeah.

183
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,618
- Where's that dough?
- What? The hundred grand?

184
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:01,353
I had it for you, only as I said,
I didn't expect...

185
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:04,651
- I know. You said it before.
- You don't have to worry about it.

186
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:07,352
- I'm not worried.
- I'll have it by the end of the week.

187
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:11,659
In the meantime, I suppose you'd like
some spending money. Here, here's 500.

188
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:14,893
I'll take that. It'll take me
a few days to get settled.

189
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,631
By that time, you can get that dough
together and tell me where I come in.

190
00:19:19,641 --> 00:19:21,472
Where you come in? What do you mean?

191
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:26,671
What business you want me to handle,
what parts of town and what my cut is.

192
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:30,578
- Your cut?
- Yeah. That was the idea, wasn't it?

193
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:34,518
I took the rap, three years. You took
the dough, made connections, built it up.

194
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,317
For you and me. Wasn't that it?

195
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:40,052
Oh, I see. Yes. I understand...

196
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:43,991
...but you've got this thing all wrong.
See, I work for Keefer. He's the boss.

197
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,897
I haven't anything to say.
If you want a spot in his business, why...

198
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,867
...you'll have to take it up with him.

199
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:53,474
Now, look, Frazier, I'm not taking it up
with anybody but you.

200
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:57,874
You figure it out for yourself.
I'm taking up with you where I left off.

201
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:02,240
That was the agreement,
and we're going to stick to it. Got it?

202
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:04,944
- Well, yes, but...
- But what?

203
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:07,849
Well...

204
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,848
- Hello, Mac.
- Am I breaking in on anything here, Jim?

205
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:15,856
No, not at all. Come right in.
I want you to meet Rocky Sullivan.

206
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:19,000
Pleased to meet you, Sullivan.
I know all about you. You're okay.

207
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:21,032
- When did you get out?
- Couple days ago.

208
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:22,670
- What are you doing?
- Looking around.

209
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:26,569
- Maybe I might have a spot for you.
- We were just talking about that.

210
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:29,370
- Where you stopping?
- A room at my old neighborhood...

211
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:31,671
...on Dock Street, number 24.

212
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:35,146
Well, I'll blow now.
I'll drop up, say, Monday?

213
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,547
- Monday? That'll be fine.
- I'm going downtown. I'll give you a lift.

214
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,087
- Thanks.
- See you later, Jim.

215
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:43,755
Monday.

216
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:55,069
Get me Steve.

217
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:58,236
There's a fella leaving with Mac.
I want you to...

218
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:00,670
Yeah?

219
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:09,080
Yeah, I got a good look.

220
00:21:10,118 --> 00:21:12,052
Yeah, yeah. I got it.

221
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:14,249
Sure, I'll take care of him.

222
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:20,653
Out of the way, blubberhead.
The famine is on.

223
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:25,155
Guys, want some cigarettes?
All you guys can have cigarettes off me.

224
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:27,996
You better pack them now, boys.
Here comes the beef trust.

225
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:31,472
How do you do?

226
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,877
- A nickel you don't conk him.
- All right, a nickel I do.

227
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:46,046
- You missed him, chump.
- Yeah. A nickel apiece you owe.

228
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,314
That cop don't walk right or something.

229
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:56,496
- Those cops are so dumb, it's pathetic.
- You'd think they'd learn where...

230
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:58,656
...a tomato comes from in police college.

231
00:21:59,468 --> 00:22:01,095
Look.

232
00:22:02,037 --> 00:22:07,065
Hello, toots. You want the bottle?
You want the bottle? Oh, nuts.

233
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,602
Hey! What are you doing with my baby?

234
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:14,215
"Hey! What are you doing with my baby?"
Here's your baby!

235
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:17,216
- You loafer! I'll get the cops after you!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

236
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:20,048
The way he talks, you'd think
he had something there.

237
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,817
Excuse me.

238
00:22:26,161 --> 00:22:28,186
Hey. Look at the dude.

239
00:22:30,132 --> 00:22:33,465
- Come on. Let's give him the works.
- All right, kiddo.

240
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:41,303
- Hey, watch out!
- Give me that!

241
00:22:41,476 --> 00:22:45,936
I'll make you eat that ball in a minute!
All right, come on! Let's go!

242
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,139
Like taking candy from a baby.

243
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:01,552
How'd you get it, Crab?

244
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,426
I hoisted it over the transom
in the alley and dropped it.

245
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:08,330
- The corner caught me right in the dome.
- So long as it didn't break the machine.

246
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:11,870
Boy, we'll be in the money now.

247
00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:22,282
Six nickels and two slugs.

248
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:25,477
Imagine crooks like that?
Putting slugs in a slot machine.

249
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,747
- Chiselers.
- I'm gonna break this thing...

250
00:23:27,923 --> 00:23:29,185
Pipe down.

251
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,154
- It's only Soapy and the gang.
- That's good.

252
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,458
Hi, Soapy!

253
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,635
- Soapy, look what we got.
- You should see the hook I got.

254
00:23:41,903 --> 00:23:43,666
It's the most I got in my life.

255
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,008
- We got a sucker's poke.
- No kidding!

256
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:51,271
- Come on. Dish it out. Time's a-wasting.
- What's the matter, crabbing already?

257
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:55,112
- Give me air! Give me air!
- How much you got there, Soapy?

258
00:23:55,283 --> 00:23:59,982
- Let me see. Ten, 20, 30, 35...
- Gee! There must be more than 100 there!

259
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:03,056
- A hundred nothing. We're in the big chips.
- Wow, what a haul!

260
00:24:03,225 --> 00:24:05,056
"Wow, what a haul!"

261
00:24:05,227 --> 00:24:08,856
- Six ways! Don't forget, six ways!
- You'll get yours.

262
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,329
- What, are you grabbing already?
- Come on. Come on. Give me, Soapy.

263
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:16,164
- Oh, that looks nice.
- Oh, my!

264
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:18,238
We split half, all right?

265
00:24:19,774 --> 00:24:23,471
- Hey, I didn't get mine!
- You bunch of chiselers!

266
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:26,079
Stick them up!

267
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,778
You're all covered.

268
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:31,976
Give us a break, mister.
We wasn't there.

269
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:34,054
We had nothing to do with it.

270
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:43,965
- Say your prayers, mugs.
- On the level, mister!

271
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:45,759
Shut up, rats!

272
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:49,067
Stop your squealing.

273
00:24:52,474 --> 00:24:54,567
- Who's the leader?
- I am.

274
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,040
Come here.

275
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,381
Collect that dough, and fast.

276
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,080
Come on. Hand it over.
You too. Come on.

277
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:11,458
Here.

278
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,253
Now get them up and turn around.

279
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:21,058
- Hey!
- Hey! What's the matter?

280
00:25:22,137 --> 00:25:25,629
Next time you roll a guy for his poke,
make sure he don't know your hideout.

281
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,432
How did you know?

282
00:25:28,543 --> 00:25:30,272
Come here, suckers.

283
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,047
- How do you know this place so good?
- Yeah, how do you know?

284
00:25:35,483 --> 00:25:38,043
Let me show you. Here.

285
00:25:39,187 --> 00:25:40,449
Look at this.

286
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:44,451
- "R.S."?
- Hey, you ain't Rocky Sullivan!

287
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:46,792
Rocky Sullivan!

288
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:50,297
Hey, did you get that?
It's Rocky Sullivan!

289
00:25:50,498 --> 00:25:53,160
We tried to hook you! What a boner!

290
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:55,098
When you saw us duck down the alley...

291
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,398
...you knew we was headed to the hideout.
- I took the old shortcut.

292
00:25:58,573 --> 00:26:01,041
- What do they call you?
- Soapy's the name. He's Bim.

293
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:04,042
This mug here's Swing.
This palooka up here's Hunky.

294
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:07,841
- Hi, Rocky.
- And I'm Pasty, and this guy's Crabface.

295
00:26:08,016 --> 00:26:10,246
- We just call him Crab for short.
- Hi.

296
00:26:10,418 --> 00:26:13,683
Glad to meet you, Rocky.
Fellas, meet Rocky Sullivan, headliner!

297
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:15,152
- Hi, Rocky!
- Hiya, Rocky!

298
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,881
Good to see you!

299
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:22,187
Hey, Rocky.

300
00:26:22,764 --> 00:26:25,358
Hey, you took the room above us,
number 24, didn't you?

301
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:27,091
- Yeah.
- Sure, sure. We knew.

302
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:30,727
- You knew when you rolled me?
- Certainly. Johnny Maggione told us.

303
00:26:30,905 --> 00:26:34,204
- He didn't tell us who you was.
- You shouldn't have taken a chance.

304
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:37,743
Never bother anybody in your own
neighborhood. You got a lot to learn.

305
00:26:37,912 --> 00:26:40,244
You ought to be able to learn us, Rocky.

306
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:43,073
Now, look, how would you like
to have a bite with me?

307
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:48,413
Here's a fin. Go to the deli
and get some sandwiches and pickles...

308
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,616
...and some beer. Bring them over
to my place. We'll have a feed.

309
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,145
I'm not in a bread line.
Will you give me some beans?

310
00:27:12,314 --> 00:27:15,306
- All right, all right, all right.
- I'm on no hunger strike.

311
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:19,783
- Give out with this Irish caviar.
- Come on. A little more, you stingy grubber.

312
00:27:19,954 --> 00:27:22,752
- Give me some pickles.
- You don't want any pickles.

313
00:27:22,924 --> 00:27:25,586
- Sure, I want pickles.
- You like pickles? Take them.

314
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,057
Boy! Pickles!

315
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,257
- What are you doing? Going into business?
- No. Souvenirs. Free.

316
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:35,368
Here, Rocky. Here's your change.
4 and a half bucks even.

317
00:27:35,537 --> 00:27:38,734
- Where's the other 50 cents?
- We had to buy something, didn't we?

318
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,866
You guys got an awful lot to learn.
Chuck your chest up to the wood.

319
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:46,407
- These beans are rotten.
- Oh. You don't like the beans?

320
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,242
No!

321
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:55,053
Hey, these beans taste soapy.
But good! Very good.

322
00:28:00,962 --> 00:28:02,657
Come in.

323
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,562
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hello, Rocky.

324
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:09,568
What do you hear? What do you say?
Having a little bite to eat with the kids.

325
00:28:09,738 --> 00:28:10,932
- Sit in?
- Sure, why not?

326
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,573
- Right here.
- Thanks.

327
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,038
- How about a sandwich?
- All right.

328
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,673
Thanks, Swing.

329
00:28:17,912 --> 00:28:20,574
It didn't take long to get
acquainted with Rocky, did it?

330
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:23,775
Hey, Rock, looks like you
and the Father are old pals.

331
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,682
Look, next time you get
down to the hideout...

332
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:31,085
...look at that old door. You'll see right
next to my initials, "J.C." Jerry Connolly.

333
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:33,853
Father used to hang with
Rocky at the old boiler room?

334
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:36,929
Certainly. We spend most of our
time at the gym now, Rocky.

335
00:28:37,098 --> 00:28:38,588
Oh, yeah?

336
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:41,463
Boys, I hoped to start
that basketball game today.

337
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:45,037
- We're too busy. Too busy.
- Hey, give me a sandwich, will you?

338
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:49,765
What's the matter, Soapy? Why don't
you want to go to the basketball game?

339
00:28:49,944 --> 00:28:53,141
- It ought to be fun.
- You think we're a bunch of cream puffs?

340
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:56,249
Hey, imagine us playing
basketball all of a sudden.

341
00:28:56,418 --> 00:28:59,444
Oh, yeah? Well, I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what.

342
00:28:59,854 --> 00:29:03,119
I'll bet a buck to a nickel you can't
get the ball past the other team.

343
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:06,522
- And I haven't even seen them.
- We'll run them into the ground.

344
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:10,458
- You'll come with us, Rocky?
- Yeah, is it a bet?

345
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:13,624
- I got a nickel. It's a bet.
- Split the winnings.

346
00:29:13,802 --> 00:29:16,896
- We have to practice first.
- The gym is open, you can go now...

347
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:19,266
...if you like, go ahead.

348
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:25,842
Goodbye, Father.

349
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,879
I've been working on them
for a year. Can't get anyplace.

350
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:34,021
You talk for 10 minutes, they'd
jump through a hoop if you asked.

351
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,680
Maybe it's because
I wear my collar frontwards.

352
00:29:37,225 --> 00:29:40,490
As long as you're sponsoring the gym,
let's go and take a look at it.

353
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:44,621
- You mean now?
- Sure. Come on, I want to show you.

354
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:49,232
- You remember old Krausmeyer's store.
- Yeah, sure. We used to rob it.

355
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:54,699
I've been trailing him, but he's
mixed up with a priest and kids...

356
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:58,073
...and I can't get a crack at him.
- Don't let him out of your sight.

357
00:29:58,246 --> 00:30:00,874
I'll send Bugs down with a couple boys.

358
00:30:01,783 --> 00:30:05,048
Come on, fellas. Let's wipe up
the floor with these kids!

359
00:30:11,593 --> 00:30:14,027
The kids play a swell game.
Keep a good eye on them.

360
00:30:14,195 --> 00:30:16,026
Keep your chin covered.

361
00:30:17,465 --> 00:30:21,458
All right, boys, clear the floor!
Take the mats off! Line up.

362
00:30:23,304 --> 00:30:24,862
- Hello.
- Hello.

363
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,467
- Friends?
- Okay.

364
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:31,178
What have you been doing,
playing a duck for me?

365
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:34,577
- I wasn't gonna hurt you.
- No, I forgot you were in the neighborhood.

366
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:40,647
Well, what are you doing?

367
00:30:41,155 --> 00:30:43,715
Same thing you're doing,
watching the game.

368
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:49,358
Say, you turned out to be
a pretty snappy-looking dish.

369
00:30:49,531 --> 00:30:51,761
- Thanks.
- For a sociable worker.

370
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,561
- Thanks again.
- I can't figure out why some smart guy...

371
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:58,103
...hasn't grabbed you off.
- Some smart guy always in the headlines?

372
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,308
You could do worse.

373
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:10,843
You know better than that.
Wait till I blow the whistle.

374
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:12,486
Okay, let's get going.

375
00:31:23,898 --> 00:31:25,832
- What happened?
- Here you are. Right here.

376
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:27,295
Ready?

377
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,067
Run! Run!

378
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:40,073
- Free throw!
- That's not fair. He didn't do nothing.

379
00:31:42,684 --> 00:31:44,049
That's it.

380
00:31:53,928 --> 00:31:56,453
- Come on! Take it down!
- I got my man!

381
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:06,607
You do that again,
you're out of the game.

382
00:32:06,774 --> 00:32:10,107
- I didn't do nothing. He's screwy.
- Give us a break.

383
00:32:10,278 --> 00:32:12,940
- What's the matter?
- Can't even shove a guy in this game?

384
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:15,105
What do you mean, shove a guy?

385
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,845
It's a free throw. Gibby, take it.

386
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,418
That's not fair!

387
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,389
- Hey, dribble that ball and pass it.
- Dribble that.

388
00:32:32,066 --> 00:32:33,294
Foul!

389
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:36,061
That big bozo just stuck his belly out.

390
00:32:36,504 --> 00:32:39,996
You boys know better than that. You
committed technical and personal fouls.

391
00:32:40,174 --> 00:32:43,337
Stop it. You've got six men on the floor.
Pasty, get off the floor.

392
00:32:43,511 --> 00:32:46,708
- Somebody take care of that trapeze.
- Just me good deed for today.

393
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,212
All right. Red out.

394
00:32:58,126 --> 00:33:00,287
Here. Watch this.

395
00:33:01,996 --> 00:33:04,464
- Make a few notes.
- All right, boys!

396
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:07,100
Mr. Sullivan's gonna referee.

397
00:33:07,335 --> 00:33:10,862
- Don't forget about that bet.
- Go on.

398
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:13,402
- Get off the floor!
- What am I, an orphan?

399
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,735
Now! Get going! All right.

400
00:33:15,943 --> 00:33:17,808
- Don't forget. According to rules.
- Yeah.

401
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:19,469
- Throw it to me.
- Here we go.

402
00:33:20,214 --> 00:33:22,842
What's the matter with you?
Don't raise your hand to me.

403
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:24,348
Get in here. Play ball.

404
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:26,510
Ready? Position, now. Here we go.

405
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:27,916
Wait for the whistle.

406
00:33:30,324 --> 00:33:32,292
What's going on here?

407
00:33:36,297 --> 00:33:38,629
- Rocky sure handles those kids, doesn't he?
- Yes...

408
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,633
...but don't you think it's a bit
like playing with dynamite?

409
00:33:41,803 --> 00:33:43,270
Why do you say that, Laury?

410
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,635
Look, Father, just because you've got
me seeing things straight now...

411
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:48,867
...there's no reason I should wear blinders.

412
00:33:49,043 --> 00:33:51,944
I still remember what Rocky's kind is like.

413
00:33:52,346 --> 00:33:54,007
I don't know.

414
00:33:54,682 --> 00:33:58,140
Somehow, I feel that Rocky
could be straightened out.

415
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,618
Get up!

416
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:04,119
- Come on! Let's go!
- Break it up!

417
00:34:05,693 --> 00:34:07,126
Foul!

418
00:34:09,664 --> 00:34:11,222
All right!

419
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,230
Come on! Sullivan,
what are you doing?

420
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,700
Foul!

421
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,044
Foul ball!

422
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,320
- Wait for the whistle, you understand?
- Let's go.

423
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:46,394
- What's the idea?
- He didn't do nothing.

424
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:47,693
What's the idea?

425
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:51,032
I'm asking you. Play according to the rules,
or I'll slap sense into you.

426
00:34:51,205 --> 00:34:54,800
- I didn't do nothing!
- Well, don't do it again. Give me that ball.

427
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:56,204
Here we go.

428
00:35:03,484 --> 00:35:04,917
Where you running?

429
00:35:06,087 --> 00:35:07,987
Personal foul.
Free throw over here.

430
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:09,883
I didn't do nothing.

431
00:35:15,463 --> 00:35:19,126
- Foul!
- Foul? What did he do, hit me?

432
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:20,991
Foul. Our ball over here.

433
00:35:22,904 --> 00:35:24,599
- Get him!
- Give me that ball!

434
00:35:24,772 --> 00:35:26,797
Give me that ball.

435
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,913
Rocky, what are you doing,
playing for the other team?

436
00:35:35,082 --> 00:35:38,176
Now, are you guys going to play
according to the rules or not?

437
00:35:38,352 --> 00:35:39,580
Okay, Rocky.

438
00:35:39,754 --> 00:35:41,619
According to the rules, fellas. Got me?

439
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:43,381
We'll beat them!

440
00:35:44,926 --> 00:35:47,918
Thirty-two to 8. Boy, what a slaughter.

441
00:35:48,095 --> 00:35:50,222
What do you mean, 32 to 8?
It was a close game.

442
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:53,834
- Yeah! You just won by a nose.
- All you guys, shower down.

443
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:57,266
Right there. All those nickels. You. You.
You. And you. Right there.

444
00:35:57,438 --> 00:35:58,666
Put them in there.

445
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,603
- Somebody stole it.
- They played rough.

446
00:36:00,775 --> 00:36:02,140
Where's my nickel?

447
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,972
- Who put those slugs in there?
- Not me.

448
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:07,512
- Kid, come on.
- Think I'd gyp you?

449
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:11,373
Rocky, you give us some practice tomorrow,
and we'll mop up these mugs.

450
00:36:11,552 --> 00:36:13,918
I don't know nothing about that.
Better ask Father.

451
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,182
- Will you give us another chance tomorrow?
- Father! Come on!

452
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:19,223
- Give us some practice.
- Be a sport.

453
00:36:19,393 --> 00:36:20,621
Well, I'll tell you...

454
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:23,958
...promise no fouls. Meet me here,
and I'll try to arrange a game.

455
00:36:24,131 --> 00:36:26,122
- Can you get smaller kids?
- Yeah.

456
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,129
Oh, boy!

457
00:36:29,237 --> 00:36:31,296
- You didn't know it was there, did you?
- No.

458
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:38,368
Just in time. Thanks.

459
00:36:38,546 --> 00:36:39,774
Say...

460
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,244
...you going home?
- Yes.

461
00:36:41,415 --> 00:36:43,076
I'll wait for you.

462
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,721
Hey, Rock...

463
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:53,589
...you wanna watch out. She's a jinx.
She put her last guy 6 foot under.

464
00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:56,921
Anybody ask you?

465
00:36:57,398 --> 00:36:59,559
I didn't say a word.

466
00:37:05,406 --> 00:37:08,807
- Who's carrying your books for you now?
- Nobody.

467
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:12,275
I heard somewhere about you being
mixed up with a guy. Who was that?

468
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:14,676
There was only one: My husband.

469
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:17,816
- Took care of him?
- Yeah, about four years ago.

470
00:37:20,888 --> 00:37:22,150
What happened?

471
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,484
What usually happens when a boy
gets mixed up...

472
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,422
...with a bunch of would-be
tough guys.

473
00:37:26,594 --> 00:37:28,824
He was a swell kid
when we first got married.

474
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:32,056
But he tried to give me a lot more
than he could get driving a cab.

475
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:34,793
Partly my fault. I didn't stop him.

476
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:36,561
Well, he got in deeper and deeper.

477
00:37:36,737 --> 00:37:39,171
One night, he tried to shoot it out
with the cops.

478
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,205
That's what always happens, isn't it?

479
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:43,536
Maybe with guys who don't know
their business.

480
00:37:43,711 --> 00:37:46,976
Hey, look, I think I got something
in my eye. Can you see anything?

481
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,674
- No.
- Got a handkerchief?

482
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,216
Yeah, sure.

483
00:37:58,392 --> 00:37:59,882
No, no. It's all right.

484
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:01,358
What's the difference?

485
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,156
I've seen everything.

486
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:08,063
You know, you were right the other day.

487
00:38:08,235 --> 00:38:11,261
This neighborhood don't change much.
Know that?

488
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:23,146
There's too much traffic.
We gotta wait for a better opening.

489
00:38:23,317 --> 00:38:26,081
Now, trail him slow. We'll get him.

490
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:33,250
Well, here we are.

491
00:38:33,427 --> 00:38:34,951
Here we go.

492
00:38:37,131 --> 00:38:40,498
Honey, make out this is where you
live. Say good night, and go inside.

493
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:42,829
- What's wrong?
- Stop asking questions. Go on in.

494
00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:45,632
Sure. Good night, Rocky,
and thanks for bringing me home.

495
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:48,741
- Good night.
- Rocky, please be careful.

496
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,126
He just went in the drugstore.

497
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:09,996
Can I help you, sir?

498
00:39:10,164 --> 00:39:11,529
I don't think so.

499
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,623
Cherry Coke.

500
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:16,401
You go in and keep the place cleared out.

501
00:39:20,174 --> 00:39:23,200
I don't like the setup.
We gotta figure out something.

502
00:39:23,377 --> 00:39:25,743
The guy's heel is in too good a spot.

503
00:39:25,913 --> 00:39:29,314
We go in the front, he swings around
and starts popping. It's no good.

504
00:39:31,685 --> 00:39:33,346
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

505
00:39:33,754 --> 00:39:36,018
We get him in the phone booth
where he can't move.

506
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:39,159
Hop in the delicatessen.
Ring the drugstore and ask for Sullivan.

507
00:39:39,326 --> 00:39:41,851
Leave the receiver off the hook.
If he falls for it, we're set.

508
00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:43,462
Okay.

509
00:39:46,867 --> 00:39:47,856
Got a phone?

510
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:50,196
- How about my prescription?
- When'd you leave it?

511
00:39:50,371 --> 00:39:52,134
- Yesterday.
- The name?

512
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,536
- Peterson.
- Excuse me. I'll see.

513
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,541
Hello. Nadler Drugstore.

514
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,108
Who?

515
00:40:01,282 --> 00:40:02,772
Just a minute.

516
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,178
You Rocky Sullivan?

517
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,286
- Yeah.
- You're wanted on the telephone.

518
00:40:16,197 --> 00:40:17,562
Hello.

519
00:40:17,731 --> 00:40:19,062
Rocky Sullivan speaking.

520
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:20,962
Hold the line.

521
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:26,872
He fell for it. Ed, hop in the car
and keep close. Let's go.

522
00:40:29,143 --> 00:40:32,237
Get in that backroom. Keep your mouth
shut and your eyes closed.

523
00:40:32,413 --> 00:40:34,904
- Go on. Get going.
- I'll have it in just a minute.

524
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:39,282
Give me that canister.

525
00:40:39,453 --> 00:40:41,080
Now back up.

526
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,149
Come on. Faster.

527
00:40:45,826 --> 00:40:47,726
Now get in there, and get in deep.

528
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:49,658
Answer that phone.

529
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:28,965
Right over there, officer!

530
00:41:30,771 --> 00:41:32,932
- What do you know?
- Never saw him before.

531
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:35,632
He asked for a prescription.
Said he left it yesterday.

532
00:41:35,809 --> 00:41:38,437
I couldn't remember.
He said his name was Peterson.

533
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:44,716
Clean it out! Clear out!

534
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,144
Come on. Hurry it up.

535
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,117
Hey, can you see him?
There must be 100 holes in him.

536
00:41:54,295 --> 00:41:56,126
Who do you think done it, Soapy?

537
00:41:56,297 --> 00:42:00,495
- On your way! Beat it! Clear out of here!
- Who do you think you're pushing?

538
00:42:01,035 --> 00:42:02,468
Hello, Frazier.

539
00:42:02,636 --> 00:42:04,297
This is Bugs.

540
00:42:04,471 --> 00:42:06,063
Everything's fixed. We got him.

541
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,865
That's good.

542
00:42:08,509 --> 00:42:11,137
All right, drop out of sight
for a couple of days.

543
00:42:29,763 --> 00:42:31,321
- Rocky.
- Yeah. Rocky.

544
00:42:31,498 --> 00:42:34,797
I ain't dead yet. Give me those keys.
Get going.

545
00:42:38,038 --> 00:42:39,630
Open it up.

546
00:42:54,188 --> 00:42:57,021
I didn't have anything to do with it,
Rocky, I swear.

547
00:42:57,191 --> 00:42:59,955
I ought to give it to you in the head,
but you owe me 100 grand.

548
00:43:00,127 --> 00:43:03,426
It's yours, but I've only got about
2000 here. I'll get the rest later.

549
00:43:03,597 --> 00:43:05,758
Shut up and get it open.

550
00:43:05,933 --> 00:43:07,594
Get away from there.

551
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:11,069
Saving these too?
You're a smart lawyer, Frazier.

552
00:43:11,238 --> 00:43:12,967
A little too smart for your own good.

553
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,539
- Two grand.
- Yeah, that's all.

554
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:19,270
- There's some securities and some bonds.
- Get out of here. Sit down.

555
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:29,146
There. Fourth Street National, 280,000.
Farmers and Merchants, 160,000.

556
00:43:29,323 --> 00:43:31,416
Industrial Trust, 65,000.

557
00:43:31,592 --> 00:43:33,924
You done all right, Frazier.
I'm mighty proud.

558
00:43:34,094 --> 00:43:37,621
- Why shouldn't I? We're partners, ain't we?
- Of course, Rocky. Of course.

559
00:43:37,798 --> 00:43:39,595
Just like we said three years ago.

560
00:43:39,767 --> 00:43:41,132
- Let's see...
- That's nothing.

561
00:43:41,302 --> 00:43:43,463
Sit down and relax.

562
00:43:44,571 --> 00:43:46,539
We're collecting autographs?

563
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,267
Some pretty important...
Some very important people.

564
00:43:49,443 --> 00:43:52,003
Some officials here might be
interesting to know about.

565
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:54,841
Paid off just about everybody in town.
Made them sign too.

566
00:43:55,015 --> 00:43:59,042
That's the way you held the club over
them? I'm gonna take this and study up.

567
00:43:59,453 --> 00:44:01,887
- One partner should know about the other.
- Of course.

568
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,490
- What's Keefer's number?
- Circle-0500.

569
00:44:04,658 --> 00:44:06,091
- His private number.
- That's it.

570
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,386
Dial.

571
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:11,861
Now, look. You're gonna get on there
and tell Keefer I'm coming in the morning.

572
00:44:12,032 --> 00:44:14,227
And he's to get me that 100 grand,
you get it?

573
00:44:14,535 --> 00:44:19,404
And no wrong cracks, or I'll cut you
off short. Got that too? Come on.

574
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,768
Hello, Mac? This is Rocky.

575
00:44:21,942 --> 00:44:24,809
Yeah. Surprise, surprise.
No, I ain't down at the morgue.

576
00:44:24,978 --> 00:44:28,607
It's one of your own boys. Look,
Frazier wants to talk to you. Go ahead.

577
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:31,750
Hello, Mac? Rocky will be up
at the El Toro in the morning.

578
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,217
11:00. That'll give him time
to get to the bank.

579
00:44:34,388 --> 00:44:36,822
11:00. That'll give you time
to get to the bank.

580
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:39,891
Take $ 100,000 out of my personal
account and give it to him.

581
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,758
What's up? Is he holding you?

582
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,693
- Tell him yes.
- Yes.

583
00:44:44,865 --> 00:44:47,095
You've got to do it, Mac.
You understand?

584
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,700
Okay. I'll give it to him.

585
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:52,896
- No slip-ups. It's very important to you.
- And no slip-ups. It's very important to me.

586
00:44:53,073 --> 00:44:55,337
Okay, okay. I said I'd give it to him.

587
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:56,635
Come on.

588
00:44:56,810 --> 00:45:00,143
Mac, I get you out of bed?
Oh, I'm so sorry.

589
00:45:01,982 --> 00:45:03,347
I think he's sore.

590
00:45:13,793 --> 00:45:16,387
Good morning, gentlemen.
Nice day for murder.

591
00:45:16,563 --> 00:45:18,793
- Where's Frazier?
- Where's that 100 grand?

592
00:45:18,965 --> 00:45:20,865
- Think we're gonna pay off?
- Certainly.

593
00:45:21,034 --> 00:45:24,765
If I don't get it in three minutes,
Frazier will be splashed all over my hideout.

594
00:45:24,938 --> 00:45:27,998
- You don't expect to get away with this?
- Why not?

595
00:45:28,174 --> 00:45:29,801
I guess we can make you talk.

596
00:45:33,914 --> 00:45:36,348
All right. Suppose you don't make me talk.

597
00:45:36,516 --> 00:45:38,848
I give you a wrong number.
Another wrong number.

598
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:42,853
Meanwhile, Frazier's watching the clock,
waiting for the phone to ring.

599
00:45:43,023 --> 00:45:44,718
How much you like Frazier?

600
00:45:45,825 --> 00:45:48,191
- Give him the dough.
- Well, look...

601
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:49,794
Give him the dough.

602
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:55,257
Look...

603
00:45:55,435 --> 00:45:57,198
...suppose you don't produce Frazier.

604
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:58,928
What do I want with him?

605
00:45:59,105 --> 00:46:02,006
A hundred grand.
Give me a phone with an outside line.

606
00:46:12,252 --> 00:46:13,480
Hello.

607
00:46:13,653 --> 00:46:15,587
Poleano Vegetable Market.

608
00:46:15,755 --> 00:46:17,620
Hello. Yeah, this is Rocky.

609
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:21,591
Look, when I walk past your window,
call that number I gave you.

610
00:46:21,761 --> 00:46:24,025
But don't call if you see me
smoking a cigarette.

611
00:46:24,197 --> 00:46:25,664
That means I'm being followed.

612
00:46:25,966 --> 00:46:27,593
Hello. Hello.

613
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:30,395
What you talk? You crazy?

614
00:46:31,438 --> 00:46:33,030
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

615
00:46:37,277 --> 00:46:39,074
Yeah. All right.

616
00:46:39,245 --> 00:46:41,406
See, when I walk past that window...

617
00:46:41,581 --> 00:46:44,049
...Frazier will be sprung.
Unless I'm followed.

618
00:46:44,651 --> 00:46:46,278
Okay. Beat it and let him go.

619
00:46:51,658 --> 00:46:54,559
We'll get him as soon as we see Frazier.

620
00:46:55,061 --> 00:46:56,722
I got a better idea.

621
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:59,195
Get me the police station.

622
00:47:00,433 --> 00:47:01,730
Hello.

623
00:47:01,901 --> 00:47:03,869
It's Mac Keefer. Let me talk to Buckley.

624
00:47:04,771 --> 00:47:06,762
Hello, Buck? Mac.

625
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,168
Yeah.

626
00:47:08,341 --> 00:47:11,538
Listen, I'm gonna do something for you.
I'm gonna give you a hot tip.

627
00:47:11,711 --> 00:47:14,509
Last night, Rocky Sullivan
snatched Frazier.

628
00:47:14,714 --> 00:47:16,579
I just paid off 100 grand to him.

629
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,775
What are you doing, kidding me?

630
00:47:20,687 --> 00:47:23,554
Yeah. Yeah, I get you.
Thanks for the tip.

631
00:47:23,923 --> 00:47:25,254
Okay.

632
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:27,086
What you doing? I don't get you.

633
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,125
What's the idea of bringing
the cops in?

634
00:47:29,295 --> 00:47:30,887
Because I'm not a mug.

635
00:47:31,064 --> 00:47:33,897
I'm smart, see.
Sure, you'd like rough stuff.

636
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:38,697
Why, when you can do it nice and legal?
No trouble, no fuss.

637
00:47:38,872 --> 00:47:43,172
And the top boys will like it. Why don't
you guys use your brains like I do?

638
00:48:09,769 --> 00:48:11,031
- Soapy, my room.
- Be right up.

639
00:48:26,753 --> 00:48:29,483
- Where's Rocky Sullivan's room?
- Upstairs.

640
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:40,095
Get out of here and stash that someplace
where it'll be safe. Don't open it.

641
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:41,756
Okay, Rocky.

642
00:49:01,454 --> 00:49:02,887
This is it.

643
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:06,720
Come on, Sullivan. Open up.

644
00:49:06,893 --> 00:49:08,793
Come in. It's open.

645
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,991
- How are you, Rocky?
- Hello.

646
00:49:16,169 --> 00:49:18,103
Why all the artillery?

647
00:49:26,312 --> 00:49:27,540
Reading your life story.

648
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,011
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

649
00:49:43,129 --> 00:49:44,687
You forgot the garbage can.

650
00:49:50,837 --> 00:49:52,270
What did you do with it?

651
00:49:53,273 --> 00:49:55,764
- Tell me what you're looking for.
- The dough.

652
00:49:55,942 --> 00:49:58,410
- What dough?
- Get your coat on.

653
00:50:02,415 --> 00:50:04,940
Speed it up, Rocky. You're not so funny.

654
00:50:05,952 --> 00:50:07,749
It's killing me.

655
00:50:12,725 --> 00:50:15,023
Quiet! Quiet!

656
00:50:15,195 --> 00:50:18,494
- What the cops jug him for?
- He didn't have time to tell me nothing.

657
00:50:18,665 --> 00:50:20,929
He gives me this and tells me to hide it.

658
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,432
- What do you think's in it?
- How should I know?

659
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,798
- Something valuable.
- Let's open it and see.

660
00:50:25,972 --> 00:50:27,963
- Wanna lose your hand?
- What's the idea?

661
00:50:28,141 --> 00:50:32,373
- Rocky said not to open it. See?
- All right. All right. I was just asking.

662
00:50:33,279 --> 00:50:34,507
How'd you get away with it?

663
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:38,344
You should've seen them cops pass me
on the stairs. They don't know nothing.

664
00:50:38,518 --> 00:50:40,918
And me with this in me shirt.

665
00:50:43,289 --> 00:50:46,417
You're all wrong, boys.
There was no snatch.

666
00:50:46,593 --> 00:50:50,154
- We was on a business trip, that's all.
- Come on, Rocky. Just spill.

667
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:53,356
- We've got all the dope anyway.
- Let me call my lawyer.

668
00:50:53,533 --> 00:50:54,693
Oh, sure.

669
00:50:54,867 --> 00:50:58,030
- Yeah. Who is your lawyer, Rocky?
- Frazier.

670
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,502
Hello, Jim.

671
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:09,147
- Hello.
- Don't know how you feel. You look terrible.

672
00:51:09,315 --> 00:51:13,012
It wasn't any picnic down in the cellar,
with a lot of rats and dirt.

673
00:51:13,186 --> 00:51:15,120
Maybe you'll leave the rough stuff to me.

674
00:51:15,288 --> 00:51:18,621
Well, is it my fault if those apes of yours
can't get the right man?

675
00:51:18,791 --> 00:51:20,816
- Did you put anybody after Sullivan?
- No.

676
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:23,019
- That's good.
- You did that once too often.

677
00:51:23,329 --> 00:51:26,059
- I'm letting the coppers take care of him.
- You what?

678
00:51:26,232 --> 00:51:29,759
I tipped them off that he snatched you.
I just got word they picked him up.

679
00:51:29,936 --> 00:51:32,530
- That's what you shouldn't have done.
- It's already done.

680
00:51:32,705 --> 00:51:35,105
You don't understand.
Sullivan got me at my home.

681
00:51:35,275 --> 00:51:36,867
He's got everything in my safe:

682
00:51:37,043 --> 00:51:40,206
Account books, receipts, names,
addresses, everything.

683
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:44,373
If he's prosecuted for this kidnapping,
he'll talk. He's got evidence to back it up.

684
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:46,484
He'll tear this whole town wide open.

685
00:51:46,653 --> 00:51:50,453
- We gotta pull him out of there.
- Lf anybody pulled a boner, you did.

686
00:51:53,459 --> 00:51:56,053
- Get me Buckley.
- Let me talk to him.

687
00:51:56,796 --> 00:51:58,593
Hello. Hello?

688
00:51:58,765 --> 00:52:00,494
Buckley? This is Mac.

689
00:52:00,667 --> 00:52:03,033
Listen, you'll have to spring Sullivan.

690
00:52:03,202 --> 00:52:06,171
Yes, I just learned it's all been
a little mistake.

691
00:52:06,339 --> 00:52:07,966
Little mistake, what do you mean?

692
00:52:08,141 --> 00:52:12,578
A mistake in a pig's eye!
You can't pull a thing like this on me.

693
00:52:13,913 --> 00:52:15,904
- See you soon, Rocky.
- Not if I can help it.

694
00:52:16,082 --> 00:52:17,071
Drive west.

695
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:20,185
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!
Lawyer kidnapped!

696
00:52:20,353 --> 00:52:22,514
Extra! Extra! Lawyer kidnapped!

697
00:52:22,689 --> 00:52:24,213
Yes, sir.

698
00:52:25,158 --> 00:52:26,557
Thank you, sir. Extra!

699
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:32,725
"Two-gun Rocky Sullivan,
well-known gangster...

700
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:35,333
...perpetrated the snatch
and received the money.

701
00:52:35,501 --> 00:52:38,265
Sullivan evidently returned
directly to his boyhood haunt...

702
00:52:38,438 --> 00:52:41,066
...following his release and was
here a few days...

703
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,607
...before he kidnapped James Frazier,
the prominent attorney and playboy.

704
00:52:44,777 --> 00:52:47,245
Ransom asked was 100,000 smackers."

705
00:52:47,413 --> 00:52:51,907
- Boy, you don't find that in poor boxes.
- Yeah. Leave it to Rocky.

706
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:55,179
- I'll bet that dough's in the envelope.
- Maybe it is. So what?

707
00:52:55,355 --> 00:52:57,050
So the kid has an idea.

708
00:52:57,223 --> 00:53:00,158
And if Rocky does go up,
it all belongs to us.

709
00:53:00,326 --> 00:53:02,317
That envelope goes to Rocky, see?

710
00:53:02,695 --> 00:53:05,255
Even if it gotta wait 20 years.

711
00:53:05,431 --> 00:53:06,955
You won't have to wait that long.

712
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,459
- Rocky!
- Hey, Rocky!

713
00:53:10,636 --> 00:53:12,763
Glad to see you.
We was just talking about you.

714
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:14,668
- Did you break out?
- No. I walked out.

715
00:53:14,841 --> 00:53:17,332
- It said in the papers...
- Never believe them.

716
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:22,243
First you're in, and then you're out.
Boy, they certainly can't hold you, Rocky.

717
00:53:22,982 --> 00:53:25,644
- Come on. Where's that envelope?
- I got it. I got it.

718
00:53:25,818 --> 00:53:27,581
All right, let's have it!

719
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:42,260
Wait a minute, Rocky.
I'll get it for you.

720
00:53:43,703 --> 00:53:46,501
Here you are, Rocky.
Just like you give it to me.

721
00:53:46,672 --> 00:53:50,005
Hey, that's the 100 grand
the paper said you got, ain't it?

722
00:53:54,347 --> 00:53:56,372
Asking questions again, huh?

723
00:53:58,117 --> 00:54:02,144
Listen, someday you're gonna stick your
nose, and you're gonna get something in it.

724
00:54:02,321 --> 00:54:04,881
- I only thought it was...
- Shut up!

725
00:54:05,391 --> 00:54:08,758
Now, look, you don't know anything
about this, see?

726
00:54:09,395 --> 00:54:11,886
No. No. No, I don't know nothing.

727
00:54:12,064 --> 00:54:14,259
- But you do know what guys get who talk.
- Yeah.

728
00:54:14,734 --> 00:54:16,395
Yeah. Yeah.

729
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,631
Now, look...

730
00:54:21,808 --> 00:54:24,038
...that goes for the rest of you.
You understand?

731
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:26,075
- Certainly.
- Sure!

732
00:54:26,245 --> 00:54:29,544
- Now we're pals.
- Put her there, Rocky!

733
00:54:36,756 --> 00:54:38,280
All right, Soapy.

734
00:54:38,458 --> 00:54:40,289
Here you are.

735
00:54:41,561 --> 00:54:43,756
Cut that up any way you like.

736
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:46,728
- It's okay. I just saw it made.
- Thanks, Rocky.

737
00:54:46,899 --> 00:54:48,799
Yeah, don't have to worry about the guys.

738
00:54:48,968 --> 00:54:52,267
We once had a squealer in the gang,
but now he ain't got no teeth.

739
00:54:52,438 --> 00:54:54,406
- I'll see you in a couple days.
- Hey, Rock!

740
00:54:54,574 --> 00:54:57,065
- So long, Rocky!
- Bye, Rock!

741
00:54:57,243 --> 00:54:59,074
Hey, Rocky!

742
00:55:00,813 --> 00:55:03,008
- Have a good time!
- Come on, guys!

743
00:55:04,317 --> 00:55:06,410
- You ought to join the circus.
- Yeah!

744
00:55:06,586 --> 00:55:08,053
Here's your cut.

745
00:55:08,354 --> 00:55:11,187
- Come on. Give me some of that.
- Fifty bucks!

746
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:13,256
"Fifty bucks!"

747
00:55:13,493 --> 00:55:17,589
- Yeah! And the same for the rest of you too.
- Oh, boy, 50 simoleon.

748
00:55:17,763 --> 00:55:22,359
My old man never made that much in his life
working for the Department of Sanitation.

749
00:55:22,535 --> 00:55:24,969
- Hey, how much you got there, Soapy?
- About 100.

750
00:55:25,137 --> 00:55:27,901
A hundred? How come?
It's twice as much as I got.

751
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:31,202
- You wanna make something out of it?
- No. No.

752
00:55:31,377 --> 00:55:35,711
- He deserves it. Why you starting trouble?
- You pull in your ears.

753
00:55:35,882 --> 00:55:37,281
What are we gonna do with it?

754
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:39,179
It's burning a hole through my hands.

755
00:55:39,352 --> 00:55:42,753
I'm gonna get me a pair
of chromium-plated brass knuckles.

756
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,186
- Come on!
- Let's go!

757
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,036
- Can I come in, Rocky?
- Yeah. Yeah.

758
00:56:06,212 --> 00:56:08,043
Wait a minute, Jerry.

759
00:56:13,219 --> 00:56:15,983
Just a second! I wanna dry me hands.

760
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,684
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hello, Rocky.

761
00:56:22,862 --> 00:56:25,956
- What do you hear? What do you say?
- What do you say?

762
00:56:26,399 --> 00:56:28,560
You know, you gave me a terrific scare.

763
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:32,465
Before I finished reading about your arrest,
they said you were out.

764
00:56:32,638 --> 00:56:35,573
Nothing to it. You know how it is
with a guy with a record.

765
00:56:35,741 --> 00:56:37,902
Haul him in because you have
nothing else to do.

766
00:56:38,077 --> 00:56:40,875
- They didn't keep you very long.
- What are you worrying about?

767
00:56:41,047 --> 00:56:43,447
- Plenty.
- What's up?

768
00:56:43,616 --> 00:56:46,483
The boys had a return game today,
and they haven't shown up.

769
00:56:46,652 --> 00:56:48,142
I can't locate them.

770
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:51,654
- Thought you might know where they were.
- How would I? Am I a nursemaid?

771
00:56:51,824 --> 00:56:53,849
No, Rocky. I didn't mean that.

772
00:56:54,026 --> 00:56:56,654
Thought they might be up here
celebrating your release.

773
00:56:57,463 --> 00:56:59,658
With them, it's kind of a hero worship.

774
00:57:00,499 --> 00:57:02,490
You can't blame them for that, can you?

775
00:57:02,668 --> 00:57:06,866
Rocky, why don't you tell me
what it's all about.

776
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:10,497
Look, Jerry, I've been answering
a lot of questions all morning, see.

777
00:57:10,676 --> 00:57:12,541
A lot of them.

778
00:57:14,213 --> 00:57:16,477
Frazier and me were just away
on a business trip.

779
00:57:20,486 --> 00:57:24,650
Some dope wanted to start trouble and
have a laugh on the cops at the same time.

780
00:57:24,824 --> 00:57:28,282
- Spread a false alarm, that's all.
- I'm glad it wasn't any more than that.

781
00:57:28,461 --> 00:57:29,860
I'm gonna run along.

782
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,156
- Yeah? Hello, Laury!
- Hello, Father.

783
00:57:32,331 --> 00:57:35,164
What do you say?
This looks like it's getting to be a big day.

784
00:57:35,334 --> 00:57:37,359
I have to admit, I was pretty worried.

785
00:57:37,536 --> 00:57:39,731
Sounds very nice to hear.

786
00:57:40,673 --> 00:57:43,198
Well, Father, I finally located
our precious angels.

787
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:45,037
- You did? Where?
- Murphy's poolroom.

788
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,304
- What?
- Yeah, Soapy and the gang.

789
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:51,541
Passing out beer to the neighborhood
kids. Throwing dollar bills like confetti.

790
00:57:51,717 --> 00:57:55,084
- Wonder where they got the money.
- Well, you might ask them.

791
00:57:56,188 --> 00:57:59,680
- Well, I'm gonna be going, Rocky.
- So soon?

792
00:58:01,093 --> 00:58:02,651
- Coming, Laury?
- No, Father.

793
00:58:02,828 --> 00:58:05,388
I want to stay and talk to Rocky
for a while.

794
00:58:07,099 --> 00:58:08,623
When will I see you, Rocky?

795
00:58:09,902 --> 00:58:12,268
- I'll catch up with you.
- Okay.

796
00:58:12,438 --> 00:58:14,099
Bye.

797
00:58:20,713 --> 00:58:22,840
- Well, Rocky, I guess...
- Wait a minute.

798
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:27,113
You're the kind of gal that's smart enough
to mind her own business.

799
00:58:27,586 --> 00:58:29,554
- Am I right or wrong?
- Don't worry.

800
00:58:29,722 --> 00:58:31,451
I know all the rules.

801
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:36,421
Get your one here. Five. Get your 10 here.
All bets covered! Come on, put it in.

802
00:58:36,595 --> 00:58:39,029
Where'd you get the dough, Pasty?

803
00:58:39,198 --> 00:58:40,529
We wrote to Santa Claus, see.

804
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:43,692
Then when we woke up this morning,
there it was in our socks.

805
00:58:43,869 --> 00:58:45,894
All bets covered. Come on, boys.

806
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:54,268
- Give me another one.
- What do you mean? All I bet was 5 bucks!

807
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:57,678
- You trying to gyp the kid or something?
- He owes me 5 bucks.

808
00:58:57,850 --> 00:58:59,477
Shut up!

809
00:59:02,588 --> 00:59:05,751
- Dirty tables aggravate me.
- You're gonna make this shot, you know.

810
00:59:05,925 --> 00:59:08,689
- Put your eight ball on the corner.
- Okay.

811
00:59:09,061 --> 00:59:11,359
- All right.
- Hey, bury that beef, will you?

812
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:14,055
Pull in your head and get that off the table!

813
00:59:14,233 --> 00:59:16,292
Got a three ball off the corner.

814
00:59:20,706 --> 00:59:23,300
Nice shot, boy!
Eight bucks!

815
00:59:23,976 --> 00:59:27,776
Eight bucks! My mother has to work almost
all week to make this much.

816
00:59:27,947 --> 00:59:29,642
Give, give, give.

817
00:59:29,815 --> 00:59:31,612
All right. All right.

818
00:59:32,918 --> 00:59:35,148
All gamblers die broke.

819
00:59:36,522 --> 00:59:39,685
Hey, Soapy, you promised us another round
of beers if you won.

820
00:59:39,859 --> 00:59:41,918
Okay, go on, bring up another case.

821
00:59:42,094 --> 00:59:45,655
What's the difference?
Those chumps are paying for it.

822
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,031
- What is this, a raid?
- No.

823
00:59:49,301 --> 00:59:51,701
Maybe they're gonna make
a Sunday school out of it.

824
00:59:53,072 --> 00:59:55,472
- Come on. I'll take two.
- I got that covered.

825
00:59:55,641 --> 00:59:58,235
- Give me two.
- I got it covered.

826
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:00,605
Weren't you boys going over
to start that game?

827
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:04,682
Sure, Father, we just wanted to see
what was going on in here.

828
01:00:05,251 --> 01:00:08,778
Come on, Joe. Come on, kids.
Let's go to the gym.

829
01:00:15,261 --> 01:00:17,092
Giving a party, Soapy?

830
01:00:19,398 --> 01:00:20,990
Everybody invited?

831
01:00:22,067 --> 01:00:23,659
Yeah.

832
01:00:24,436 --> 01:00:26,028
Why don't you give it at the gym.

833
01:00:27,506 --> 01:00:29,337
Because we're having it here.

834
01:00:29,608 --> 01:00:31,542
What about that game you asked for?

835
01:00:32,845 --> 01:00:34,472
Hey, Small Change...

836
01:00:34,647 --> 01:00:38,310
...double that bet on that shot, okay?
- Okay. It's your murder.

837
01:00:39,318 --> 01:00:41,912
Where did you get this money
you've been spending?

838
01:00:42,588 --> 01:00:45,785
Hasn't anything I've told you for the last
three years meant anything?

839
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:48,085
You think that spending
this kind of money...

840
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:51,627
...with a lot of hoodlums is gonna get you
anyplace but jail?

841
01:00:54,466 --> 01:00:56,696
Come on, fellas, what do you say?

842
01:00:57,636 --> 01:01:00,662
Why not go with me, and we'll figure
this whole thing out.

843
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,933
Come on. Let's go over to the gym.

844
01:01:04,109 --> 01:01:06,942
- How about it, Swing?
- I don't know, Father.

845
01:01:07,746 --> 01:01:09,737
I got a sore leg.

846
01:01:10,382 --> 01:01:12,043
What do you say, Bim?

847
01:01:13,118 --> 01:01:16,645
Father, there ain't no future
in playing basketball.

848
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:20,916
- Well, how about you fellas?
- Can't a guy even have any fun?

849
01:01:21,093 --> 01:01:22,720
It's a waste of time.

850
01:01:23,529 --> 01:01:25,258
Look, Father...

851
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:29,864
...we don't fall for that pie-in-the-sky
stuff no more, see.

852
01:01:40,145 --> 01:01:42,943
What's wrong? Can't you get them
to go to heaven with you?

853
01:01:47,419 --> 01:01:50,786
You got the wrong slant, honey.
You got a bad break a long time ago...

854
01:01:50,956 --> 01:01:53,220
...and you're still figuring
that's the only way.

855
01:01:53,392 --> 01:01:55,417
You're reading stuff about
"crime don't pay."

856
01:01:55,594 --> 01:01:59,758
Don't be a sucker. That's for smalltimers
on shoestrings. Not people like us.

857
01:01:59,932 --> 01:02:02,400
You belong in the bigshot class.
Both of us do.

858
01:02:02,568 --> 01:02:04,160
- I wonder.
- Look...

859
01:02:04,336 --> 01:02:07,237
Got any glad rags, something fancy,
an evening gown?

860
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:10,636
- A very old one.
- Well, come on, get it on.

861
01:02:10,809 --> 01:02:13,744
- We'll go out and celebrate.
- What will we be celebrating?

862
01:02:13,913 --> 01:02:16,473
All this! You don't get on
the front pages every day.

863
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:18,617
You don't get away
from the cops every day.

864
01:02:18,784 --> 01:02:21,014
You do if you're smart. Come here.

865
01:02:22,588 --> 01:02:24,715
See those white lights up there?

866
01:02:25,724 --> 01:02:28,522
That's where you belong,
and that's where you're going.

867
01:02:28,694 --> 01:02:31,026
Come on, I'll show you who
this town's made for.

868
01:02:31,196 --> 01:02:34,393
Well, I hope that old gown of mine
hangs together.

869
01:02:37,369 --> 01:02:39,098
- Wants an eight.
- Wants an eight.

870
01:02:39,271 --> 01:02:41,796
- Here's 10,000 on red.
- You got a bet!

871
01:02:42,641 --> 01:02:45,041
Thirty-six, red.

872
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:47,804
- Place your bets.
- Give the lady a stack of black chips.

873
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:49,208
- For whom?
- For me.

874
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:51,713
- Rocky Sullivan.
- Oh, yes. Sure, of course.

875
01:02:51,884 --> 01:02:55,376
Try your luck. I got some business.
I'll be back in a while.

876
01:02:55,554 --> 01:02:58,580
- But, Rocky, I'm not lucky.
- Don't be afraid. Let your hair down.

877
01:02:58,757 --> 01:03:01,351
- Have some fun. Go ahead.
- Place your bets.

878
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,290
- How much are these?
- Fifty dollars.

879
01:03:03,462 --> 01:03:05,930
- Change them to dollar chips.
- But he wants black.

880
01:03:06,098 --> 01:03:08,566
- I don't like black.
- Oh, you don't like black.

881
01:03:09,335 --> 01:03:12,270
After I knew the facts, and seeing how
Jim owed you the dough...

882
01:03:12,438 --> 01:03:16,534
...and it being a misunderstanding,
we'll call it square, with no hard feelings...

883
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:19,303
...especially now that you're
in the know of things.

884
01:03:19,478 --> 01:03:21,776
- You boys really want to talk business?
- Yeah.

885
01:03:21,947 --> 01:03:23,244
Come on, let's talk.

886
01:03:23,515 --> 01:03:26,951
Look here, Rocky, what about
those accounts you took from my safe?

887
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:30,520
Those are very good insurance,
just in case you boys change your minds.

888
01:03:30,689 --> 01:03:33,214
- Okay. What do you want, Rocky?
- Nothing from you, Mac.

889
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:36,623
Just my original agreement with Frazier:
50 percent of everything.

890
01:03:37,162 --> 01:03:38,925
That sounds fair enough, Jim.

891
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:42,727
All right. It's a deal.

892
01:03:43,268 --> 01:03:45,998
Now, look, I'm gonna take very good care
of those accounts.

893
01:03:46,171 --> 01:03:48,731
If I was you, I wouldn't do anything
I'd be sorry for...

894
01:03:48,907 --> 01:03:52,104
...because I'm gonna pay special attention
to those books, understand?

895
01:03:52,277 --> 01:03:55,269
A deal between you guys is a deal,
just like it was on paper.

896
01:03:55,447 --> 01:03:59,110
- That's me, Rocky. I do everything legal.
- Oh, yeah. I know that.

897
01:03:59,284 --> 01:04:02,515
If you don't mind, partners, my accountant
will go over the books...

898
01:04:02,688 --> 01:04:05,350
...just to make sure you boys ain't cheating.
Fair enough?

899
01:04:05,524 --> 01:04:07,185
- Yeah.
- Okay.

900
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:14,728
How long do you think I'll let that guy
sit in my chair?

901
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:18,392
Just as long as he hangs on
to that information.

902
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:31,072
- You like this place?
- Sure. Why wouldn't I?

903
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:33,241
- Just got a piece of it.
- Rocky.

904
01:04:33,419 --> 01:04:35,614
- Yeah.
- Maybe you are smart enough.

905
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:39,451
How'd you like to give up that
two-for-nickel job and move in here?

906
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:40,990
Doing what?

907
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,789
Just sitting, looking pretty, dance a little,
play a little. Kind of a hostess.

908
01:04:44,963 --> 01:04:46,828
Give you 100 a week and expenses.

909
01:04:46,999 --> 01:04:51,732
And it'll be very nice to have
at least one friend in this place.

910
01:05:07,753 --> 01:05:08,981
Come in.

911
01:05:10,222 --> 01:05:11,712
Yes, Mrs. McGee, what is it?

912
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:15,917
Well, I've had lunch waiting since noon,
then this package came by messenger.

913
01:05:16,095 --> 01:05:18,495
I thought maybe it was important,
so I brought it up.

914
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:19,961
All right. Thank you.

915
01:05:20,132 --> 01:05:22,123
Is there anything wrong, Father?

916
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:25,270
No, no, nothing.
Oh, I won't have any lunch.

917
01:05:25,437 --> 01:05:29,533
If I'd known that this morning,
I could've saved some money.

918
01:05:59,071 --> 01:06:01,096
You wait. I'll tell him you're here.

919
01:06:02,975 --> 01:06:04,408
Make yourself at home.

920
01:06:04,576 --> 01:06:05,804
Thanks.

921
01:06:17,055 --> 01:06:19,956
Hi, Jerry. What do you hear?
What do you say? Trying your luck?

922
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:22,423
Yes, I'd like to,
but I haven't got any money.

923
01:06:22,594 --> 01:06:25,085
Except this, and it's not mine.

924
01:06:25,264 --> 01:06:28,165
- Say, where did you get ahold of that?
- Where did you?

925
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:31,896
Here, Rocky. Thanks, but I can't accept it.

926
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:34,470
What's the matter? You silly?
That ain't mine.

927
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,108
I know it isn't. That's why I can't take it.

928
01:06:37,276 --> 01:06:38,504
What is this?

929
01:06:38,677 --> 01:06:43,546
You flash this wad on me, then try to tell
me the dough is mine. What's it all about?

930
01:06:43,815 --> 01:06:46,443
You've got a great poker face, Rocky.

931
01:06:46,618 --> 01:06:49,746
But don't forget, I've known that face
for a long time.

932
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:52,948
I know you forced Frazier to get you
$ 100,000. Everybody knows it.

933
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:55,286
What's the difference
where the dough came from?

934
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:57,519
First place, Frazier owed it to me.
It's mine.

935
01:06:57,696 --> 01:07:00,290
Second, it's a lot better you get
a chunk of it than him.

936
01:07:00,465 --> 01:07:03,366
And suppose the dough is hot?
Nobody knows that but you and me.

937
01:07:03,535 --> 01:07:04,797
That's just it.

938
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:07,063
Oh, come on. Don't be such an angel.

939
01:07:07,239 --> 01:07:09,639
You want to get the center built?
Go get it started!

940
01:07:09,808 --> 01:07:12,003
I don't want to build it
on rotten foundations.

941
01:07:12,177 --> 01:07:13,974
Oh, don't be a sucker!

942
01:07:14,146 --> 01:07:16,046
All right, Rocky.

943
01:07:16,215 --> 01:07:17,842
Supposing I take the money.

944
01:07:18,016 --> 01:07:22,009
And I kid myself it's a means to an end.
Well, it isn't. Never will be.

945
01:07:22,187 --> 01:07:24,985
Inside the center, my boys will be clean,
and outside...

946
01:07:25,157 --> 01:07:28,752
...they'd be surrounded by the same
rotten corruption and crime and criminals.

947
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:30,360
Yes, yourself included.

948
01:07:30,662 --> 01:07:34,291
Criminals on all sides for my boys
to look up to and revere...

949
01:07:34,466 --> 01:07:37,560
...and respect and admire and imitate.

950
01:07:37,736 --> 01:07:40,432
What good is it to teach
that honesty is the best policy...

951
01:07:40,606 --> 01:07:43,575
...when all around, they see
that dishonesty is a better policy?

952
01:07:43,742 --> 01:07:46,939
The hoodlum and gangster is looked up to
with the same respect...

953
01:07:47,112 --> 01:07:50,275
...as the successful businessman
or popular hero.

954
01:07:50,449 --> 01:07:53,350
You, and the Fraziers
and the Keefers...

955
01:07:53,518 --> 01:07:57,249
...and the rest of those rotten politicians
you've got in the palm of your hand.

956
01:07:57,422 --> 01:08:00,050
Yes, and you've got my boys too.

957
01:08:00,392 --> 01:08:04,158
Whatever I teach them,
you show me up.

958
01:08:04,329 --> 01:08:06,729
You show them the easiest way.

959
01:08:06,965 --> 01:08:09,024
The quickest way
is with a racket or a gun.

960
01:08:09,201 --> 01:08:11,533
Well, it's so, ain't it?

961
01:08:12,771 --> 01:08:15,797
Yes, it's so. God help us.

962
01:08:16,742 --> 01:08:18,607
You see, Rocky...

963
01:08:18,777 --> 01:08:21,746
...I thought I could solve
my problems and...

964
01:08:22,314 --> 01:08:24,874
Problems with my boys,
which, after all, they are...

965
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:26,915
...from the bottom up.
But I can't do it.

966
01:08:27,085 --> 01:08:29,383
- I've got to start from the top down.
- Yeah? How?

967
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:32,013
I'll tell you how.

968
01:08:32,190 --> 01:08:34,590
I'm gonna use your kidnapping Frazier
as a crowbar...

969
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,625
...to pry open and uncover
this cesspool.

970
01:08:36,795 --> 01:08:38,922
I'm gonna force the law,
corrupt or not...

971
01:08:39,097 --> 01:08:41,725
...to bring to the light of day
this filthy affair.

972
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,869
Now, there's gonna be a lot of people
stepped on, Rocky...

973
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:48,967
...and if you happen to get in the way...

974
01:08:49,141 --> 01:08:52,235
...I'll be sorry, but you'll be stepped on
just as hard.

975
01:08:52,411 --> 01:08:56,347
All right, Jerry, go to it. But you've got
as much chance of getting an indictment...

976
01:08:56,515 --> 01:08:58,483
...as I have of getting into
Bible Society.

977
01:08:58,650 --> 01:09:00,242
You'll find nobody cares.

978
01:09:00,419 --> 01:09:03,320
You'll find them laughing at you.
End up a lot of blind alleys.

979
01:09:03,488 --> 01:09:05,888
But go ahead, kid.

980
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:09,960
And if I'm in your way, why,
keep on stepping just as hard.

981
01:09:11,463 --> 01:09:14,296
For being honest
and for old times' sake.

982
01:09:14,466 --> 01:09:17,458
Rocky, there's one favor I'm gonna
have to ask you.

983
01:09:17,636 --> 01:09:20,036
Maybe I won't be able to return it.

984
01:09:20,205 --> 01:09:22,230
Well, go ahead. Anything you say.

985
01:09:22,607 --> 01:09:25,599
Soapy and those kids,
give them a break, will you?

986
01:09:25,777 --> 01:09:27,972
Don't offer them any more money.

987
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:31,377
Don't encourage them to...
To admire you.

988
01:09:32,851 --> 01:09:34,785
All right. I'll do that.

989
01:09:36,121 --> 01:09:37,884
Sure, you will.

990
01:10:00,912 --> 01:10:04,109
Father Connolly, I'd like to help you.
I really would.

991
01:10:04,282 --> 01:10:08,514
But we can't get away with it.
The organization is too powerful to fight.

992
01:10:13,558 --> 01:10:15,355
You know what you're asking of me?

993
01:10:15,527 --> 01:10:16,926
Yes, Mr. White.

994
01:10:17,095 --> 01:10:20,360
The other papers have gone to great lengths
to explain the risks to me.

995
01:10:20,532 --> 01:10:24,195
You'll go into the fight personally?
Devote your full time to it?

996
01:10:24,369 --> 01:10:27,167
Believe me when I say,
nothing would please me any more.

997
01:10:27,339 --> 01:10:29,330
Very well, Father Connolly, I'm with you.

998
01:10:29,508 --> 01:10:31,237
The press will back you to the limit.

999
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:33,435
Thank you, and I appreciate it.

1000
01:10:54,466 --> 01:10:57,026
Get me the inside
on Frazier and Keefer's bank accounts.

1001
01:10:57,202 --> 01:10:59,363
I don't care where you get the dope
but get it.

1002
01:10:59,538 --> 01:11:02,996
Pap, get me all the information you can
on Frazier before he got to town.

1003
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:06,303
If he'd ever been mixed up with Sullivan.
The lid is off on expenses.

1004
01:11:06,478 --> 01:11:09,072
Jenkins, go back through the police files
and find out...

1005
01:11:09,247 --> 01:11:12,478
...how many of Keefer's men
have been sprung since Frazier moved in.

1006
01:11:12,651 --> 01:11:14,016
Why are you hounding Rocky?

1007
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:16,780
Why are you trying to send him
to prison for life?

1008
01:11:16,955 --> 01:11:19,423
You can't do that to Rocky.
I won't let you.

1009
01:11:20,492 --> 01:11:21,959
It's not his fault, Father.

1010
01:11:22,127 --> 01:11:25,927
He was just a kid who made a mistake
and got sent to reform school.

1011
01:11:26,097 --> 01:11:27,689
They made a criminal out of him.

1012
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:31,199
But he's not bad, not really bad.
You know that.

1013
01:11:31,369 --> 01:11:34,167
And whatever they've done to him,
no matter what he is now...

1014
01:11:34,339 --> 01:11:36,330
...no matter whether he's right or wrong...

1015
01:11:36,508 --> 01:11:37,941
...we both love him, Father.

1016
01:11:39,744 --> 01:11:42,212
Yes, Laury, we both love him.

1017
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:45,349
I've loved him since we were kids,
6 years old.

1018
01:11:45,517 --> 01:11:48,384
We worked together, fought together.

1019
01:11:48,553 --> 01:11:50,521
Stole together.

1020
01:11:50,856 --> 01:11:54,019
Oh, I'm not blaming Rocky
for what he is today.

1021
01:11:54,226 --> 01:11:57,252
But for the grace of God,
there walk I.

1022
01:11:57,496 --> 01:11:59,794
I'd do anything for him, Laury...

1023
01:11:59,965 --> 01:12:02,525
...anything in the world to help him.

1024
01:12:02,701 --> 01:12:05,101
I'd give my life if I thought
it would do any good...

1025
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:07,204
...but it wouldn't.

1026
01:12:07,539 --> 01:12:10,030
You see, Laury,
there's all those other kids...

1027
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:14,702
...hundreds of them, in the streets
and bad environment...

1028
01:12:14,946 --> 01:12:18,143
...whom I don't want to see
grow up like Rocky did.

1029
01:12:18,617 --> 01:12:21,677
I can't sacrifice them for Rocky.

1030
01:12:22,287 --> 01:12:25,085
You see, Laury, they have lives too.

1031
01:12:25,624 --> 01:12:28,024
I can't throw them away.

1032
01:12:28,727 --> 01:12:30,752
I can't.

1033
01:12:45,243 --> 01:12:48,804
And the very fact that countless thousands
of you are listening in tonight...

1034
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:51,949
...is proof to fling in the teeth
of these cynics and skeptics...

1035
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:55,052
...that the public does care
and does propose to do something...

1036
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:58,712
...about the appalling conditions
I have tried to describe tonight.

1037
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:02,291
And do not doubt that our efforts so far
have not struck fear and panic...

1038
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:05,293
...into the cesspool of official
and near-official corruption.

1039
01:13:05,463 --> 01:13:07,693
Yeah, I'm shaking like a leaf.

1040
01:13:07,866 --> 01:13:11,358
"This very afternoon, I was approached
with a sugarcoated proposition...

1041
01:13:11,536 --> 01:13:14,164
...a bribe offered me
by this corrupt officialdom.

1042
01:13:14,339 --> 01:13:18,969
$ 100,000 for the building and equipment
of a recreation center in my parish...

1043
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:21,612
...if I would agree to refrain
from further attacks...

1044
01:13:22,113 --> 01:13:24,343
...if I would sabotage this campaign...

1045
01:13:24,516 --> 01:13:28,509
...if I would shut my eyes, stop my ears
and hold my tongue.

1046
01:13:28,687 --> 01:13:32,179
But the building of an isolated playground
to shield my boys from crime...

1047
01:13:32,357 --> 01:13:34,188
...is not rooting out the crime itself.

1048
01:13:34,359 --> 01:13:37,795
We must rid ourselves
of the criminal parasites that feed on us.

1049
01:13:37,963 --> 01:13:40,454
We must wipe out those
we have ignorantly elected...

1050
01:13:40,632 --> 01:13:44,728
...and those who manipulate this
diseased officialdom behind locked doors.

1051
01:13:45,236 --> 01:13:48,137
Tonight, we have in our power
to ask definitely...

1052
01:13:48,306 --> 01:13:51,002
...incriminating questions
of these officials.

1053
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:53,701
And the power to demand
satisfactory answers.

1054
01:13:53,878 --> 01:13:59,077
What really is the truth in the case of
the racketeer and gunman Rocky Sullivan?

1055
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:03,414
Why did the police release him so suddenly
with all the evidence they had against him?

1056
01:14:03,688 --> 01:14:07,419
Why did the notorious Mac Keefer
pay Sullivan $ 100,000 in cash...

1057
01:14:07,592 --> 01:14:10,755
...and what political sword does he hold
over the trembling hands...

1058
01:14:10,929 --> 01:14:13,489
...of district attorneys, judges
and police officials?

1059
01:14:13,665 --> 01:14:17,897
But tomorrow, the new grand jury will meet,
and these questions must be answered.

1060
01:14:18,403 --> 01:14:21,372
Therefore, I ask all of you
who are listening in... "

1061
01:14:21,539 --> 01:14:23,268
And you thought you could
buy him off?

1062
01:14:23,441 --> 01:14:26,774
- I told you you were wasting your time.
- We ain't wasting any more time.

1063
01:14:26,945 --> 01:14:28,469
That was that guy's last chance.

1064
01:14:28,647 --> 01:14:30,444
We're gonna take care of him tonight.

1065
01:14:30,615 --> 01:14:33,516
You're talking through your hat.
You can't bump off a priest.

1066
01:14:33,685 --> 01:14:34,913
Forget it.

1067
01:14:35,086 --> 01:14:38,214
I'll forget it. Tomorrow morning,
when he's floating down the river.

1068
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:39,982
Now, get this straight, Sullivan.

1069
01:14:40,158 --> 01:14:43,423
Even if he is an old pal of yours,
I'm still running the works.

1070
01:14:43,895 --> 01:14:46,261
I'm not taking orders from you
all of a sudden.

1071
01:14:46,698 --> 01:14:49,166
He's not gonna appear
at no grand jury tomorrow.

1072
01:14:49,334 --> 01:14:53,100
Shooting off his mouth...
I say he gets it tonight.

1073
01:14:54,105 --> 01:14:57,097
- Not if I'm around.
- Now, wait a minute, gentlemen.

1074
01:14:57,275 --> 01:14:59,971
There's no sense in running
too far ahead of ourselves.

1075
01:15:00,211 --> 01:15:03,180
Don't forget, there are all kinds
of grand juries...

1076
01:15:03,348 --> 01:15:05,714
...and there's all kinds of ways
of handling them.

1077
01:15:05,884 --> 01:15:07,283
That's what you got me for.

1078
01:15:07,452 --> 01:15:10,979
- Lf you can do a thing legally, why take a...?
- Sure, only I want action.

1079
01:15:11,156 --> 01:15:14,125
I don't care how we stop that guy,
I only want him stopped.

1080
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:16,260
All right, then leave it to me.

1081
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:18,055
You know, Rocky...

1082
01:15:18,229 --> 01:15:21,096
...this is no penny-ante reform wave
this priest is starting.

1083
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:23,666
This is a tidal wave,
and unless we stop it quick...

1084
01:15:23,835 --> 01:15:25,769
...we're gonna find ourselves in the pen.

1085
01:15:25,937 --> 01:15:29,873
Look, Frazier, nobody knows better than me
that we're in a spot. I know that.

1086
01:15:30,041 --> 01:15:34,273
And, Mac, as far as I'm concerned,
you can settle it any way you like.

1087
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:36,778
But lay off the rough stuff, you see?
That's out.

1088
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:40,145
I'll see you later.

1089
01:15:40,318 --> 01:15:44,220
Don't worry, Mac. I've got an idea
how we can stymie that grand jury.

1090
01:15:44,389 --> 01:15:47,586
That preacher won't get to first base.

1091
01:15:57,068 --> 01:15:59,161
I hope you were stalling.
I meant what I said.

1092
01:15:59,337 --> 01:16:00,668
This is the way I figure it.

1093
01:16:00,839 --> 01:16:03,740
- Connolly is Rocky's pal, and he's a priest.
- So what?

1094
01:16:03,908 --> 01:16:06,934
Where would be the logical place
for Rocky to keep those accounts?

1095
01:16:07,112 --> 01:16:10,081
With a priest, to make them public
if anything happens to Rocky.

1096
01:16:10,248 --> 01:16:11,840
That ain't news to me.
I knew that.

1097
01:16:12,016 --> 01:16:14,280
- That's why he can be a wise guy.
- All right.

1098
01:16:14,452 --> 01:16:18,013
If we're gonna get that preacher tonight,
why not get those accounts too?

1099
01:16:18,189 --> 01:16:19,713
Yeah.

1100
01:16:20,825 --> 01:16:23,851
Only this time, no drugstore mistakes.

1101
01:16:24,028 --> 01:16:26,121
I'm taking care of this job myself.

1102
01:16:26,631 --> 01:16:28,064
Get Blackie up here right away.

1103
01:16:28,233 --> 01:16:30,701
Now listen, Mac. I don't care how
you handle Sullivan.

1104
01:16:30,869 --> 01:16:33,133
It's got to look like an accident
with the priest.

1105
01:16:33,304 --> 01:16:34,498
Leave that to me.

1106
01:16:46,851 --> 01:16:49,820
Rocky! Don't! Don't!

1107
01:16:49,988 --> 01:16:52,149
- I'll do anything.
- Oh, no, you won't.

1108
01:16:52,323 --> 01:16:54,621
You've had your last chance.
Take this with you.

1109
01:16:54,793 --> 01:16:56,226
I never let go of those papers.

1110
01:16:56,394 --> 01:16:58,658
All you had to do was bump me off.

1111
01:17:30,428 --> 01:17:32,794
- It's locked.
- Come on, stand back. Shoot it off.

1112
01:17:43,775 --> 01:17:45,436
Gunfight at the El Toro.

1113
01:18:12,804 --> 01:18:15,932
Is Father Connolly still there?
I must talk to him. It's urgent.

1114
01:18:49,974 --> 01:18:52,442
- Well?
- Rocky Sullivan, captain.

1115
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:56,876
He got Frazier and Keefer. They've chased
him up on the roof of the El Toro.

1116
01:18:57,048 --> 01:18:58,948
MacMahon, throw a cordon
around the block.

1117
01:18:59,117 --> 01:19:00,379
Come on, you men, with me.

1118
01:19:02,987 --> 01:19:05,421
Here's the microphone, captain.

1119
01:19:06,658 --> 01:19:09,855
O'Flannigan, hook up those searchlights
and play them on the building.

1120
01:19:13,998 --> 01:19:15,989
Galavan, cover the warehouse skylights.

1121
01:20:25,837 --> 01:20:27,065
There he is!

1122
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:48,586
Sullivan, are you coming out,
or must we smoke you out?

1123
01:20:53,931 --> 01:20:56,491
All right, give him the tear gas.

1124
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:18,248
Please.

1125
01:21:27,398 --> 01:21:28,660
Captain.

1126
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:31,301
I'm Father Connolly,
an old friend of Rocky's.

1127
01:21:31,469 --> 01:21:33,403
He'll come out for me.
He'll listen to me.

1128
01:21:33,571 --> 01:21:36,597
This is a job for the police, Father.
He'll need a priest later.

1129
01:21:36,774 --> 01:21:39,971
- You wanna kill him, or you want him alive?
- What do you mean by that?

1130
01:21:40,144 --> 01:21:42,840
He'll listen to me, I'm sure.
Won't you let me talk to him?

1131
01:21:43,014 --> 01:21:45,073
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

1132
01:21:45,249 --> 01:21:49,515
Rocky! Rocky, this is Jerry.
Please come out.

1133
01:21:50,221 --> 01:21:53,054
Tell him we'll get him, if we have to
blow up the whole block.

1134
01:21:53,224 --> 01:21:56,159
Rocky, you've got to come out!

1135
01:22:06,571 --> 01:22:08,436
I'm coming up.

1136
01:22:10,608 --> 01:22:11,836
Officers, hold your fire.

1137
01:22:58,156 --> 01:23:00,124
Rocky?

1138
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:15,798
- Rocky.
- What are you doing up here? Beat it!

1139
01:23:15,973 --> 01:23:17,440
I'm coming in, Rocky.

1140
01:23:17,608 --> 01:23:19,439
You wanna get your skull full of lead?

1141
01:23:20,044 --> 01:23:22,069
Get out of here!

1142
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:25,205
You're smarter than to stick your kisser
in this place.

1143
01:23:25,383 --> 01:23:27,749
I couldn't watch them shoot you down,
Rocky.

1144
01:23:27,919 --> 01:23:31,753
They've got you covered from every angle.
Your only chance is to give yourself up.

1145
01:23:31,923 --> 01:23:34,414
You're through, Rocky. You're finished.

1146
01:23:34,592 --> 01:23:36,492
Yeah, I was until you stepped into it.

1147
01:23:37,195 --> 01:23:40,528
Father Connolly, are you all right?

1148
01:23:41,032 --> 01:23:42,329
Go on.

1149
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:45,196
Get over there and tell them
to call off their dogs.

1150
01:23:45,369 --> 01:23:47,394
I'm going down with you.

1151
01:23:47,572 --> 01:23:49,437
Sure, you are.

1152
01:23:57,715 --> 01:24:00,309
Call off your men, all of them!

1153
01:24:00,484 --> 01:24:02,315
Sullivan's coming out with me.

1154
01:24:02,486 --> 01:24:05,683
Hold your fire, men, but stand by.

1155
01:24:07,925 --> 01:24:09,517
Let's go.

1156
01:24:15,366 --> 01:24:17,664
Come on, get them up, Jerry.

1157
01:24:17,835 --> 01:24:22,101
Sorry it has to be you, kid,
but get going.

1158
01:24:23,441 --> 01:24:25,705
Get away, or I'll let him have it!
Get away!

1159
01:24:26,477 --> 01:24:28,445
Back around.

1160
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,609
Come on.

1161
01:24:51,235 --> 01:24:54,261
Get them up high. High!

1162
01:25:04,048 --> 01:25:07,313
Get back, all of you.
I'll give it to him right in the head!

1163
01:25:08,686 --> 01:25:10,278
Back!

1164
01:25:16,727 --> 01:25:18,354
Duck, Jerry!

1165
01:25:31,676 --> 01:25:33,075
Got him in the leg.

1166
01:25:37,181 --> 01:25:38,978
Empty.

1167
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:42,942
So is your thick skull, copper.

1168
01:25:43,921 --> 01:25:45,047
Extra! Identify killer!

1169
01:25:46,557 --> 01:25:48,718
Papers! Get your papers! Extra!

1170
01:25:48,893 --> 01:25:50,656
Extra! Get your papers!

1171
01:25:50,828 --> 01:25:53,058
Identify killer!

1172
01:25:53,531 --> 01:25:54,862
Gee, that's tough.

1173
01:25:55,032 --> 01:25:58,229
Boy, I'd like to get my hands
on those squealers.

1174
01:25:59,036 --> 01:26:05,441
"Special prosecutor for trial of Rocky today.
State builds strong case."

1175
01:26:05,609 --> 01:26:09,807
That dope of a governor's so scared
of Rocky, he's appointing a special shyster.

1176
01:26:10,214 --> 01:26:13,706
"Rocky guilty. To die."

1177
01:26:14,618 --> 01:26:16,882
Gee, you think they'll burn him
in the chair?

1178
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:19,885
No, they can't build no death house
that'll hold Rocky.

1179
01:26:20,057 --> 01:26:23,549
- You mean he'll blow it?
- Just wait, that's all. Just wait.

1180
01:26:25,229 --> 01:26:27,322
He'll show those mugs how to die
in a big way.

1181
01:26:27,498 --> 01:26:29,625
Sure, he will. They'll never make him crack.

1182
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,893
- There's nothing yellow about Rocky.
- You bet.

1183
01:26:32,069 --> 01:26:33,730
Remember what he said at the trial?

1184
01:26:33,904 --> 01:26:35,394
He said he'd spit in their eye.

1185
01:26:35,573 --> 01:26:37,438
He'll do it too. He'll laugh at them.

1186
01:26:37,608 --> 01:26:40,975
Sure. Sure, he'll show those phonies up.

1187
01:26:43,881 --> 01:26:45,473
Sullivan.

1188
01:26:50,454 --> 01:26:54,049
Rocky, Father Connolly has received
permission to be with you.

1189
01:26:54,225 --> 01:26:56,557
He just arrived. You'll see him, won't you?

1190
01:26:56,727 --> 01:26:58,354
Yeah, sure, send him in.

1191
01:26:58,529 --> 01:27:02,021
But tell him none of that incense
and holy-water stuff, will you?

1192
01:27:02,199 --> 01:27:04,463
Whatever you say, Rocky.

1193
01:27:12,576 --> 01:27:15,044
Did you enjoy your dinner, Mr. Sullivan?

1194
01:27:15,212 --> 01:27:17,180
Yeah, it was good,
only the meat was burnt.

1195
01:27:17,348 --> 01:27:18,975
And I don't like burnt meat,
do you?

1196
01:27:20,918 --> 01:27:23,079
Listen, big shot, you got only
10 minutes to go.

1197
01:27:23,254 --> 01:27:25,654
Don't try stalling around
with that priest pal of yours.

1198
01:27:27,491 --> 01:27:29,618
Ten minutes till that hot seat.

1199
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:34,258
I'm gonna tell the electrician
to give it to you slow and easy, wise guy.

1200
01:27:34,432 --> 01:27:36,195
Somebody get him out of here,
will you!

1201
01:27:36,367 --> 01:27:39,427
- Come on! Take him out of there!
- Get him out of there!

1202
01:27:42,807 --> 01:27:45,139
Let him alone, Herbert.

1203
01:27:46,076 --> 01:27:47,543
Quiet.

1204
01:27:48,546 --> 01:27:50,070
Quiet, now! Quiet.

1205
01:27:52,316 --> 01:27:53,647
- How are you?
- How much time?

1206
01:27:53,818 --> 01:27:55,809
About 10 minutes.

1207
01:28:03,027 --> 01:28:05,359
Hi, Jerry. What do you hear?
What do you say?

1208
01:28:05,529 --> 01:28:09,363
- Hello, Rocky. How do you feel?
- Like a million.

1209
01:28:12,036 --> 01:28:14,698
- How's Soapy and the kids?
- Pulling for you all the way...

1210
01:28:14,872 --> 01:28:17,568
...as long as there's
the slightest hope from the governor.

1211
01:28:17,741 --> 01:28:21,438
- They'll be easier to handle without me.
- That's up to you, Rocky.

1212
01:28:24,815 --> 01:28:26,339
We haven't got a lot of time.

1213
01:28:26,517 --> 01:28:28,246
I want to ask one last favor.

1214
01:28:28,419 --> 01:28:31,388
- There's not much left that I can do, kid.
- Yes, there is, Rocky.

1215
01:28:31,555 --> 01:28:34,353
Perhaps more than you could do
under any other circumstances.

1216
01:28:34,525 --> 01:28:36,959
If you have the courage for it,
and I know you have.

1217
01:28:37,127 --> 01:28:39,357
Walking in there?
That's not gonna take much.

1218
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:41,828
- I know that, Rocky.
- It's like a barber chair.

1219
01:28:41,999 --> 01:28:43,864
They're gonna ask, "Anything to say?"

1220
01:28:44,034 --> 01:28:48,232
I'll say, "Sure, give me a haircut, a shave
and one of those new electric massages."

1221
01:28:48,405 --> 01:28:51,465
- But you're not afraid, Rocky?
- No. They'd like me to be.

1222
01:28:51,642 --> 01:28:53,906
But I'm afraid I can't oblige them, kid.

1223
01:28:54,078 --> 01:28:57,241
You know, Jerry, I think to be afraid,
you gotta have a heart.

1224
01:28:57,414 --> 01:29:00,941
I don't think I got one.
I had that cut out of me a long time ago.

1225
01:29:02,419 --> 01:29:04,649
Suppose I asked you to have the heart, huh?

1226
01:29:04,822 --> 01:29:06,722
- To be scared.
- What do you mean?

1227
01:29:06,891 --> 01:29:10,156
Suppose the guards dragged you out of here
screaming for mercy.

1228
01:29:10,327 --> 01:29:13,353
- Suppose you went to the chair yellow.
- Yellow?

1229
01:29:13,531 --> 01:29:16,830
Say, what's the matter with you?
You've been worrying about my courage.

1230
01:29:17,001 --> 01:29:18,229
I know that.

1231
01:29:18,402 --> 01:29:20,370
This is a different kind of courage,
Rocky.

1232
01:29:20,538 --> 01:29:23,666
The kind that's...
Well, it's born in heaven.

1233
01:29:23,841 --> 01:29:26,401
Not the courage of heroics and bravado.

1234
01:29:26,577 --> 01:29:29,569
The kind that you and I
and God know about.

1235
01:29:30,948 --> 01:29:32,176
I don't know what you mean.

1236
01:29:32,683 --> 01:29:36,517
Look, Rocky, just before I came up here,
the boys saw me off on the train.

1237
01:29:36,687 --> 01:29:38,848
Soapy and several of the others.

1238
01:29:39,023 --> 01:29:40,820
You can well imagine what they told me.

1239
01:29:41,725 --> 01:29:45,821
"Father, tell Rocky to show the world
what he's made of.

1240
01:29:45,996 --> 01:29:48,328
Tell him not to be afraid...

1241
01:29:48,499 --> 01:29:51,059
...and to go out laughing... "
- Well, what do you want?

1242
01:29:51,235 --> 01:29:52,964
I'm not gonna let them down.

1243
01:29:53,137 --> 01:29:56,732
That's what I want you to do.
I want you to let them down.

1244
01:29:56,907 --> 01:30:01,139
See, you've been a hero to these kids and
hundreds of others, all through your life.

1245
01:30:01,312 --> 01:30:05,339
Now you're gonna be a glorified hero
in death, and I want to prevent that, Rocky.

1246
01:30:05,516 --> 01:30:07,984
They've gotta despise your memory.

1247
01:30:08,152 --> 01:30:10,245
They've got to be ashamed of you.

1248
01:30:10,421 --> 01:30:14,653
You're asking me to pull an act, turn yellow
so those kids will think I'm no-good?

1249
01:30:14,825 --> 01:30:18,784
You're asking me to throw away the only
thing I got left that they can't take away.

1250
01:30:18,963 --> 01:30:22,296
To give those newspapers a chance to say,
"Another rat turned yellow."

1251
01:30:22,466 --> 01:30:24,195
You and I will know you're not.

1252
01:30:24,368 --> 01:30:26,063
You ask a nice little favor, Jerry.

1253
01:30:26,236 --> 01:30:28,568
Asking me to crawl on my belly
the last thing I do.

1254
01:30:28,739 --> 01:30:30,263
I know what I'm asking.

1255
01:30:30,441 --> 01:30:33,774
The reason I'm asking is because
being kids together gave me the idea...

1256
01:30:33,944 --> 01:30:36,276
...that you might like to
join hands with me...

1257
01:30:36,447 --> 01:30:39,507
...and save some of those other boys
from ending up here.

1258
01:30:39,683 --> 01:30:42,083
You're asking too much.
You wanna help those kids...

1259
01:30:42,252 --> 01:30:45,949
...figure out some other way.
- It's impossible to do it without your help.

1260
01:30:46,123 --> 01:30:47,852
I can't reach all of those boys.

1261
01:30:48,025 --> 01:30:50,391
Thousands of hero-worshiping kids
all over the country.

1262
01:30:50,561 --> 01:30:52,358
Don't give me that humanity stuff again.

1263
01:30:52,529 --> 01:30:55,293
I had enough in the courtroom.
Told everything. Named names.

1264
01:30:55,466 --> 01:30:57,525
Told the whole mess.
What more do you want?

1265
01:30:58,102 --> 01:31:00,366
What I've always wanted, Rocky.

1266
01:31:00,537 --> 01:31:02,232
Straighten yourself out with God.

1267
01:31:04,008 --> 01:31:07,500
Outside of that,
I can't ask for anything else.

1268
01:31:07,678 --> 01:31:09,646
Well, don't!

1269
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:18,681
It's time, Rocky. Are you ready?

1270
01:31:18,856 --> 01:31:20,380
Yeah.

1271
01:31:24,094 --> 01:31:25,959
You figure on going in with me?

1272
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:29,588
- I'd like to, Rocky. That is, if...
- You can if you wish.

1273
01:31:29,767 --> 01:31:31,792
- Do you mind, Father?
- Certainly not.

1274
01:31:31,969 --> 01:31:35,928
That's better. Be kind of lonesome
going down that last mile.

1275
01:31:38,976 --> 01:31:40,409
Promise me something.

1276
01:31:40,577 --> 01:31:42,477
Promise me you won't let me
hear you pray.

1277
01:31:42,646 --> 01:31:44,944
I promise you won't hear me.

1278
01:31:48,552 --> 01:31:51,612
Get away from me, screw,
or I'll bust your face in.

1279
01:31:51,955 --> 01:31:54,651
It'll be the last face you see, big shot,
laughing at you.

1280
01:31:54,825 --> 01:31:56,884
Don't get near me now.
I'll spit in your eye.

1281
01:31:57,928 --> 01:32:00,089
Herbert, stand back.

1282
01:32:00,698 --> 01:32:02,757
Thompson, take care of him.

1283
01:32:03,734 --> 01:32:05,099
Lay off.

1284
01:32:05,269 --> 01:32:07,669
I don't need anybody. Come on.

1285
01:32:08,305 --> 01:32:11,172
Attaboy, Rocky.
Pick your own company.

1286
01:32:11,341 --> 01:32:14,936
So long, Rocky. We won't be long.

1287
01:32:15,112 --> 01:32:17,171
So long, Rocky.

1288
01:32:57,654 --> 01:32:59,383
Rocky, please.

1289
01:32:59,556 --> 01:33:01,251
No.

1290
01:33:17,241 --> 01:33:18,640
So long, kid.

1291
01:33:18,809 --> 01:33:20,436
Goodbye, Rocky.

1292
01:33:20,611 --> 01:33:22,841
May God have mercy on you.

1293
01:33:41,465 --> 01:33:45,265
No. I don't want to die!
Oh, please!

1294
01:33:45,903 --> 01:33:48,997
I don't want to die!
Oh, please!

1295
01:33:49,973 --> 01:33:52,635
Don't make me burn in hell!

1296
01:33:54,211 --> 01:33:59,239
Oh, please let go of me!
Please don't kill me!

1297
01:33:59,416 --> 01:34:02,852
Oh, don't kill me, please!

1298
01:34:11,695 --> 01:34:13,287
Okay, hold him down there!

1299
01:34:15,365 --> 01:34:16,764
Please don't kill me!

1300
01:34:26,543 --> 01:34:29,171
The yellow rat was gonna
spit in my eye.

1301
01:34:37,487 --> 01:34:43,084
"At the fatal stroke of 11 p.m., Rocky was
led through the little green door of death.

1302
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:45,353
No sooner had he entered
the death chamber...

1303
01:34:45,529 --> 01:34:47,929
...than he tore himself
from the guards' grasp...

1304
01:34:48,098 --> 01:34:51,124
...flung himself on the floor,
screaming for mercy.

1305
01:34:51,802 --> 01:34:54,430
And as they dragged him
to the electric chair...

1306
01:34:54,605 --> 01:34:58,234
...he clawed wildly the concrete floor
with agonized shrieks.

1307
01:34:58,809 --> 01:35:02,040
In contrast to his former heroics...

1308
01:35:03,247 --> 01:35:06,808
...Rocky Sullivan died a coward."

1309
01:35:07,885 --> 01:35:09,910
I don't believe it.

1310
01:35:10,187 --> 01:35:13,452
- I don't believe one rotten word of it.
- I don't believe it either.

1311
01:35:13,624 --> 01:35:15,785
If anybody says it's true, I'll...

1312
01:35:16,026 --> 01:35:18,256
He couldn't die that way, not Rocky!
He couldn't.

1313
01:35:18,428 --> 01:35:20,953
It's all lies! Lies, I tell you!

1314
01:35:21,698 --> 01:35:23,495
Hey, fellas.

1315
01:35:23,667 --> 01:35:25,294
Here's Father Connolly.

1316
01:35:25,469 --> 01:35:27,437
Let's ask him. He ought to know.

1317
01:35:27,604 --> 01:35:29,936
He'll tell us everything.

1318
01:35:37,714 --> 01:35:39,841
You were there, Father.

1319
01:35:40,350 --> 01:35:42,284
You saw everything.

1320
01:35:42,452 --> 01:35:44,181
What happened?

1321
01:35:44,855 --> 01:35:46,686
Did Rocky die like they said?

1322
01:35:47,357 --> 01:35:49,552
Like a yellow rat?

1323
01:35:52,796 --> 01:35:56,823
It's true, boys. Every word of it.

1324
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,366
He died like they said.

1325
01:36:02,439 --> 01:36:04,498
All right, fellas.

1326
01:36:05,275 --> 01:36:06,902
Let's go and...

1327
01:36:07,444 --> 01:36:11,380
...say a prayer for a boy
who couldn't run as fast as I could.

1328
01:37:14,644 --> 01:37:16,635
