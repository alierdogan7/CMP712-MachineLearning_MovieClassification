some information for you

about those two murdered police.

I've been asking around a bit

905

and there's a few theories
floating around

if any of them are true or not

Present is solicitor Ezra White.

Now, I’ll remind you again, Josh.

925
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,760
You're under no obligation
to say anything at this point in time

926
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,760
but anything you do say
can be used as evidence

927
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,240
in any future court appearances.

928
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,360
- You understand that?
- Yes, he understands that.

929
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:12,351
OK.

930
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:17,480
OK, now, picking up where we left off
when we last spoke,

931
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,960
you were telling us
how upset your uncles were

932
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,440
over the death of Barry Brown.

933
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,080
Can you remember what was said
or any...any comments that were made

934
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,116
at that time exactly?

935
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,400
Josh, has Mr White
provided you with advice

936
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,800
in respect to how you should conduct
yourself in this interview today?

937
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,760
Yes, he'll be remaining mute.

938
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,760
OK, I can appreciate you've been
advised not to say anything to me,

939
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,840
but the sooner you help us
with our inquiries,

940
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,800
the sooner we can scratch you off
the list and move onto a different line.

941
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,279
You do understand that, don't you?

942
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,468
Nothing else you want to say
at this point?

943
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,040
There wasn't a good
feeling in the room.

944
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,120
Leckie was running the whole

945
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,720
“Yesterday you were
very helpful” routine.

946
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,200
That was probably for my benefit.

947
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,160
But I don't know.

Look, he's just a kid.
Kids are stupid, they're weak.

949
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,560
He may think he's doing
the right thing

950
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:25,680
but really, you know,
his foot's covered in dog shit

951
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,760
and he's got it stuck
right in his mouth.

952
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,480
I’m pretty surprised you let him get
anywhere near to you, to be honest.

953
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,600
- I told you to go get that car.
- No, you didn't.

954
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,680
- I told you to go get the car.
- No, you didn't!

955
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,560
You never fuckin' mentioned it
to me once, Pope!

EZRA: I don't want to hear this.

957
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,640
You've just gotta be worried
about what he's doing.

958
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,640
DARREN: He's a big kid.
He can look after himself.

959
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,360
EZRA: Can he, now?
Can he handle police?

960
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,840
It's a totally different
kettle of fish.

961
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,280
What should we do?

962
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,880
I'd start by keeping an eagle eye
on him, that's for sure.

963
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,320
Where is he now?

964

EZRA: Mate, I can't help you
with the how part.

973
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,240
You've just gotta be looking out
for this shit, you know?

01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,560

was that for the most part,

pretty flimsy to me.

on witness testimony

discredit, I wouldn't have thought.

then J here's their star witness.

to strengthen their brief,

with something else.

the evidence I saw at the committal

- Hiding.

who raided the house today.

OK? They'd been told
something funny was going on here.

on this night

1425
