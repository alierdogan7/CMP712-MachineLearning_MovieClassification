1
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:23,270
An article, which I believe
appeared in a newspaper,

2
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:25,272
asked why, since you are,

3
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,776
or it would seem that you are in effect,

4
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:30,277
the mayor of Chicago,

5
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:33,280
you've not simply been
appointed to that position.

6
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:38,483
Well, I'll tell you, you know, it's touching.

7
00:03:38,554 --> 00:03:41,489
Like a lot of things in life,

8
00:03:41,557 --> 00:03:43,491
we laugh because it's funny,

9
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,993
and we laugh because it's true.

10
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:48,996
Some people say, "Put that man in jail.

11
00:03:49,064 --> 00:03:51,999
What does he think he is doing?"

12
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:54,001
What I hope I'm doing...

13
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:56,833
here's where your English paper's got a point...

14
00:03:56,905 --> 00:04:00,363
is I'm responding to the will of the people.

15
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:01,568
People will drink.

16
00:04:01,643 --> 00:04:02,974
We all know that.

17
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:05,878
And all I do is act on that.

18
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:07,779
All this talk of bootlegging...

19
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,283
What is bootlegging?

20
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:11,285
On the boat, it's bootlegging.

21
00:04:11,353 --> 00:04:13,287
On Lake Shore Drive, it's hospitality.

22
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:14,788
I'm a businessman.

23
00:04:14,857 --> 00:04:16,791
And what of your reputation

24
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:19,657
that you control your business through violence,

25
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:22,492
that those that don't purchase your products

26
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:24,532
are dealt with violently?

27
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:31,229
It's all right.

28
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:35,843
I grew up in a tough neighborhood.

29
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:38,675
We used to say, you can get further

30
00:04:38,747 --> 00:04:41,511
with a kind word and a gun

31
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,847
than with just a kind word.

32
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,854
In that neighborhood, it might have been true.

33
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:48,856
Sometimes a reputation follows you.

34
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:51,859
There is violence in Chicago, of course,

35
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:55,863
but not by me and not by anybody I employ

36
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:57,899
because it's not good business.

37
00:05:28,797 --> 00:05:32,233
Leave us alone down here.
We're getting along fine.

38
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:34,235
We have everything we need.

39
00:05:34,303 --> 00:05:37,238
The green beer you're peddling ain't any good.

40
00:05:37,306 --> 00:05:39,740
It ain't supposed to be good.

41
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:41,742
It's supposed to be bought.

42
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,437
I'm not buying any.

43
00:05:46,748 --> 00:05:49,182
Don't worry about it, Pops.

44
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:50,878
We won't come back.

45
00:05:53,322 --> 00:05:56,018
And how's everyone
at your house today?

46
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:57,183
They're fine.

47
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:58,988
Your mama well?

48
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:00,995
She has a little cold.

49
00:06:01,063 --> 00:06:03,088
Oh, she does, huh?

50
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:06,367
I'm sorry to hear that.

51
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:08,096
But she'll be all right.

52
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:14,372
Here you go.

53
00:06:14,443 --> 00:06:15,375
Thank you.

54
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:18,413
Oh, that's all right, sweetie.

55
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,880
You be careful crossing the street.

56
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:22,348
Mister!

57
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:23,441
Mister!

58
00:06:23,518 --> 00:06:25,713
Hey, mister!

59
00:06:25,787 --> 00:06:26,719
Wait!

60
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:28,881
Mister, wait!

61
00:06:28,957 --> 00:06:30,219
You forgot your brief...

62
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,455
Yes. I heard it on the radio.

63
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:41,123
I know.

64
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:45,633
Now it's time to go to work.

65
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:56,141
Go make a good first impression.

66
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,915
I love you, Eliot.

67
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:16,290
Now, shoo.

68
00:08:16,665 --> 00:08:18,758
Eliot Ness...

69
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:21,860
special agent of the Treasury Department.

70
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:23,131
Mr. Ness.

71
00:08:23,205 --> 00:08:24,638
Thank you, Chief.

72
00:08:24,706 --> 00:08:27,641
At the request of the city of Chicago,

73
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,142
the federal government,

74
00:08:29,211 --> 00:08:31,645
specifically the Department of the Treasury,

75
00:08:31,713 --> 00:08:33,146
has inaugurated a program

76
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:36,150
to deal with the flow of illegal liquor

77
00:08:36,218 --> 00:08:38,152
and the violence it creates.

78
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,654
Of what does this program consist?

79
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:42,656
I and other Treasury agents

80
00:08:42,724 --> 00:08:45,659
will work with the Chicago police and other...

81
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:48,161
Isn't this just another showpiece program?

82
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,165
What do you think about prohibition, Mr. Ness?

83
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:53,167
Do you drink, Mr. Ness?

84
00:08:53,235 --> 00:08:54,668
Answer the questions.

85
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:56,101
It's not a showpiece.

86
00:08:56,171 --> 00:08:57,604
And I'll tell you

87
00:08:57,672 --> 00:09:00,106
exactly how I feel about prohibition.

88
00:09:00,175 --> 00:09:02,609
It's the law of the land.

89
00:09:02,677 --> 00:09:05,111
Do you consider yourself a crusader?

90
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,114
What qualifications do you have?

91
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:09,616
Do you have any political ambitions?

92
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:11,845
All right, boys.
That's enough.

93
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,080
Excuse me.

94
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:16,090
Mr. Ness. What are your real plans?

95
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:19,093
You'll have to read about it in the paper.

96
00:09:19,161 --> 00:09:22,096
Listen, let me ride along with you.

97
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:23,995
No. Can't help you.

98
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:27,000
Mr. Ness. Lieutenant Olveson, the flying squad.

99
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:30,003
Are you ready to meet the men?

100
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:31,766
Well...

101
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,569
Yes, I am.

102
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:46,109
I have one more thing to say.

103
00:09:50,481 --> 00:09:53,917
I know that many of you take a drink.

104
00:09:53,985 --> 00:09:57,421
What you've done before today is not my concern.

105
00:09:57,488 --> 00:09:59,922
But now we must be pure,

106
00:09:59,991 --> 00:10:02,425
and I want you to stop.

107
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:03,926
It's not a question

108
00:10:03,995 --> 00:10:06,930
of whether or not it's a harmless drink.

109
00:10:06,998 --> 00:10:08,932
It's against the law, gentlemen.

110
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,798
As we are going to enforce the law,

111
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:14,133
we must do first by example.

112
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:20,209
Are there any questions?

113
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,638
Good.

114
00:10:23,715 --> 00:10:25,444
The Department of the Treasury

115
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:28,713
has had a man undercover here for some time.

116
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:31,118
We've received word from this informant

117
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:34,454
of a large shipment of
Canadian whiskey to Chicago.

118
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:37,289
I hope you've signed on for some action.

119
00:10:37,362 --> 00:10:38,954
You're going to get it.

120
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:47,270
Remember, the liquor cases are marked

121
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:49,272
with a red maple leaf.

122
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,329
Yes, sir.

123
00:10:50,408 --> 00:10:53,343
The Treasury agent is in a gray suit.

124
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:55,936
He is not to be arrested.

125
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:57,446
A gray suit.

126
00:10:57,515 --> 00:10:59,449
I think that's about it.

127
00:10:59,517 --> 00:11:00,950
Are your men ready?

128
00:11:01,018 --> 00:11:02,451
Yes, sir. They are.

129
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,782
Good.

130
00:11:09,694 --> 00:11:10,626
At ease.

131
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:13,129
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

132
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:21,037
How are we doing?

133
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:22,037
O.K.

134
00:11:27,612 --> 00:11:29,546
Want part of a sandwich?

135
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:31,047
No, thank you, sir.

136
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:38,821
You nervous?

137
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,879
No, sir.

138
00:11:42,393 --> 00:11:44,327
Been with the unit long?

139
00:11:44,395 --> 00:11:45,828
A short while.

140
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:50,400
I suppose we all want to do well.

141
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:51,799
Yes, sir.

142
00:11:55,907 --> 00:11:56,771
[Chuckles]

143
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,639
A message from my wife.

144
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:02,411
You married?

145
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,778
Yes, sir, I am.

146
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,783
Nice to be married, huh?

147
00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:23,666
What is it?

148
00:12:25,102 --> 00:12:27,002
Just follow me.

149
00:12:38,616 --> 00:12:41,176
[Dog Barks]

150
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:11,410
Federal officer.
Hands in the air.

151
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:12,949
Get them up.

152
00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:14,484
Drop it.

153
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:16,520
I can't...

154
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:19,054
Mr. Ness.

155
00:13:19,123 --> 00:13:22,456
Look, I was just...
Jeez, I'm sorry.

156
00:13:24,662 --> 00:13:28,098
Listen, listen.
I can do a lot for you.

157
00:13:28,165 --> 00:13:31,293
I get the big scoop.
You make a big splash.

158
00:13:31,369 --> 00:13:32,859
Get yourself some support.

159
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,370
What do you say?

160
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,030
Let me help you.

161
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,597
O.K. Just shut up.

162
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:05,632
All right, now!

163
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:07,694
Let's do some good!

164
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,142
Let's get 'em.
Come on, guys.

165
00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:22,515
Hold it right there!

166
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:26,355
Federal officer.

167
00:14:26,424 --> 00:14:27,857
You're under arrest

168
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:30,359
for violations of the Volstead Act.

169
00:14:43,874 --> 00:14:45,000
Preseuski.

170
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:48,537
Excuse me. Excuse me.

171
00:14:48,613 --> 00:14:51,309
No one's allowed in here.

172
00:14:51,382 --> 00:14:52,314
Mr. Ness!

173
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:53,714
It's all right.

174
00:14:53,784 --> 00:14:56,252
Let... Let him through here.

175
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,217
You want to take your picture?
Take it now.

176
00:15:02,627 --> 00:15:03,559
You ready?

177
00:15:03,628 --> 00:15:04,560
Ready.

178
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:32,855
Liquor, huh?

179
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:36,916
Get him out of here.

180
00:15:36,994 --> 00:15:39,019
Tear the place apart.

181
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:41,530
I mean now!
Get him out!

182
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:42,588
Yes, sir.

183
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,034
That means you, too.

184
00:17:13,963 --> 00:17:16,898
Now, what do you think you're doing? Hmm?

185
00:17:16,966 --> 00:17:19,400
You want to throw your garbage?

186
00:17:19,468 --> 00:17:22,403
Throw it in the damn trash basket.

187
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:26,339
Don't you have more important things to do?

188
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:27,535
Yeah.

No.

00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:47,165
He's to be seconded to the Treasury Department.

373
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:49,167
We have the cooperation of...

374
00:30:49,235 --> 00:30:52,170
Who is consistently this class' best shot?

375
00:30:52,238 --> 00:30:54,172
Williamson and Stone.

376
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,036
Please call them out...

377
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:57,042
But one at a time.

378
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,873
Is either man married?

379
00:30:58,945 --> 00:30:59,934
No.

380
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:01,674
Good.

381
00:31:01,748 --> 00:31:02,680
Williamson!

382
00:31:02,749 --> 00:31:03,681
You're married.

383
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,344
I don't want any married men.

384
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,411
All right.
Stand easy, son.

385
00:31:09,489 --> 00:31:12,117
I want to ask you something.

386
00:31:12,192 --> 00:31:14,592
Why do you want to join the force?

387
00:31:14,661 --> 00:31:16,151
To protect and s-s...

388
00:31:16,229 --> 00:31:18,493
and s... To protect and serve.

389
00:31:18,565 --> 00:31:19,623
To protect...

390
00:31:19,699 --> 00:31:22,634
Please don't search for the yearbook answer.

391
00:31:22,702 --> 00:31:24,067
Say what you think.

392
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:25,661
Well, what I think?

393
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:26,671
Yeah.

394
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,173
I could help...

395
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:30,539
with the force.

396
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,134
You can help?

397
00:31:32,212 --> 00:31:33,144
The force.

398
00:31:33,213 --> 00:31:34,612
With crime.

399
00:31:34,681 --> 00:31:36,308
Thank you.

400
00:31:36,383 --> 00:31:39,250
There goes the next chief of police.

401
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:47,484
At ease!

402
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,857
Stone.

403
00:31:48,928 --> 00:31:50,520
Out here.

404
00:31:52,265 --> 00:31:53,698
This kid's a prodigy.

405
00:31:55,602 --> 00:31:58,537
Why do you want to join the force?

406
00:31:58,605 --> 00:32:01,540
To protect the property and the citizenry...

407
00:32:01,608 --> 00:32:04,668
Don't waste my time with that bullshit.

408
00:32:04,744 --> 00:32:07,577
Where are you from, Stone?

409
00:32:09,949 --> 00:32:11,416
From the South Side.

410
00:32:11,484 --> 00:32:13,611
Stone.

411
00:32:13,686 --> 00:32:18,521
George Stone.
That's your name?

412
00:32:18,591 --> 00:32:21,253
What's your real name?

413
00:32:21,327 --> 00:32:22,658
That is my real name.

414
00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:26,130
Nah. What was it before you changed it?

415
00:32:28,635 --> 00:32:30,068
Giuseppe Petri.

416
00:32:30,136 --> 00:32:31,603
Jeez, I knew it.

417
00:32:31,671 --> 00:32:34,970
All you need is one thieving wop on the team.

418
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:37,271
What's that you say?

419
00:32:37,343 --> 00:32:40,278
I said that you're a lying member

420
00:32:40,346 --> 00:32:42,371
of a no-good race.

421
00:32:43,883 --> 00:32:47,751
It's much better than you,
you stinking Irish pig.

422
00:32:49,422 --> 00:32:50,719
Oh, I like him.

423
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,061
Yeah, I like him, too.

424
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,588
You just joined the Treasury Department, son.

425
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,692
Yeah, O.K.

426
00:33:05,138 --> 00:33:06,332
Eliot Ness.

427
00:33:07,674 --> 00:33:10,108
With reports from stakeouts and surveillances...

428
00:33:10,176 --> 00:33:14,237
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Thank you.

429
00:33:22,188 --> 00:33:23,621
What do you think?

430
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:27,558
I think there's nothing like vaudeville.

431
00:33:27,627 --> 00:33:29,060
That's what I think.

432
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:32,121
Now, are you ready to go to work?

433
00:33:32,198 --> 00:33:33,631
Where are we going?

434
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,635
On a liquor raid.

435
00:33:36,703 --> 00:33:38,136
We need another man.

436
00:33:38,204 --> 00:33:40,138
Hey, Ness, it's very interesting.

437
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:43,141
I've found a financial disbursement pattern here

438
00:33:43,209 --> 00:33:44,540
which shows some irregu...

439
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:45,771
You carry a badge?

440
00:33:45,845 --> 00:33:47,210
Yes.

441
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,542
Carry a gun.

442
00:34:05,431 --> 00:34:06,955
Jimmy?

443
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:07,965
What?

444
00:34:10,036 --> 00:34:13,062
What the hell are you dressed for, Halloween?

445
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,004
Shut up.
I'm working.

446
00:34:15,074 --> 00:34:15,938
Where?

447
00:34:16,009 --> 00:34:16,976
The circus.

448
00:34:35,261 --> 00:34:36,694
Look.
They've got guns.

449
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:39,865
Well, here we are.

450
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:41,366
What are we doing here?

451
00:34:41,434 --> 00:34:42,526
Liquor raid.

452
00:34:45,371 --> 00:34:46,463
Here?

453
00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:49,474
Mr. Ness, everybody knows where the booze is.

454
00:34:49,542 --> 00:34:51,476
The problem isn't finding it.

455
00:34:51,544 --> 00:34:54,069
It's who wants to cross Capone.

456
00:34:54,147 --> 00:34:55,239
Let's go.

457
00:35:03,056 --> 00:35:05,490
You'd better be damn sure, Malone.

458
00:35:10,863 --> 00:35:13,297
If you walk through this door,

459
00:35:13,366 --> 00:35:16,233
you're walking into a world of trouble.

460
00:35:16,302 --> 00:35:18,236
No turning back, you understand?

461
00:35:18,304 --> 00:35:19,828
Yes, I do.

462
00:35:19,906 --> 00:35:21,237
[Cocks Gun]

463
00:35:21,307 --> 00:35:22,934
Good.

464
00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:24,442
Give me that ax.

465
00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:34,547
Federal officers!

466
00:35:34,621 --> 00:35:37,055
Get your hands up!
Nobody moves!

467
00:35:37,123 --> 00:35:38,556
This is a raid!

468
00:35:39,892 --> 00:35:42,087
What are you doing here?

469
00:35:42,161 --> 00:35:44,095
All this stuff is impounded.

470
00:35:44,163 --> 00:35:46,063
You're all under arrest.

471
00:35:46,132 --> 00:35:47,565
Hey, this isn't right.

472
00:35:47,634 --> 00:35:49,568
Hey, this is no good.

473
00:35:49,636 --> 00:35:51,069
You got a warrant?

474
00:35:51,137 --> 00:35:52,934
Sure. Here's my warrant.

475
00:35:55,475 --> 00:35:58,376
How do you think he feels now,

476
00:35:58,444 --> 00:35:59,775
better or worse?

477
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,952
What is that?

478
00:36:08,021 --> 00:36:09,454
What is that?

479
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:11,319
Yes. What is it?

480
00:36:11,391 --> 00:36:13,325
God, I'm with the heathen.

481
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:15,759
That is my call box key,

482
00:36:15,828 --> 00:36:17,762
and that is St.Jude.

483
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,764
Santo Judaea.

484
00:36:19,832 --> 00:36:22,767
He's the patron saint of lost causes.

485
00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:23,927
And policemen.

486
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:27,229
Patron saint of policemen.

487
00:36:27,307 --> 00:36:29,775
Mmm. Everybody needs a friend.

488
00:36:31,244 --> 00:36:33,804
Lost causes, policemen.

489
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,314
Which do you want to be?

490
00:36:36,382 --> 00:36:38,680
I want to be a cop.

491
00:36:38,751 --> 00:36:39,740
You do?

492
00:36:39,819 --> 00:36:40,751
Yeah.

493
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,912
Why?

494
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:45,922
To protect the property and citizenry...

495
00:36:49,362 --> 00:36:52,263
Who... It's all... It's all right.

496
00:36:52,332 --> 00:36:53,458
What?

497
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:54,591
Congratulations.

498
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:59,104
O.K. If I get a picture of you and your men?

499
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:02,198
Yeah. But not for publication, just for us.

500
00:37:02,275 --> 00:37:04,209
Anything you say, Mr. Ness.

501
00:37:05,345 --> 00:37:07,723
Closer in.
Arms straight.

502
00:37:07,857 --> 00:37:08,755
O.K., ready? Hold it.

503
00:37:16,699 --> 00:37:18,257
Life goes on.

504
00:37:18,334 --> 00:37:20,598
[Laughter]

505
00:37:22,972 --> 00:37:24,405
A man becomes preeminent,

506
00:37:24,473 --> 00:37:28,000
he's expected to have enthusiasms.

507
00:37:28,077 --> 00:37:29,601
Enthusiasms.

508
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,847
Enthusiasms.

509
00:37:34,984 --> 00:37:36,417
What are mine?

510
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,353
What draws my admiration?

511
00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:42,357
What is that which gives me joy?

512
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:44,086
- Dames.
- Music.

513
00:37:48,597 --> 00:37:49,859
Baseball.

514
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:58,229
A man...

515
00:37:58,307 --> 00:38:01,242
A man stands alone at a plate.

516
00:38:04,246 --> 00:38:07,579
This is the time for what?

517
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,244
For individual achievement.

518
00:38:12,688 --> 00:38:14,451
There he stands alone.

519
00:38:15,825 --> 00:38:19,124
But in the field, what?

520
00:38:19,195 --> 00:38:21,789
Part of a team.

521
00:38:21,864 --> 00:38:23,525
Teamwork.

522
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,157
Teamwork.

523
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:31,333
Looks, throws, catches, hustles...

524
00:38:31,407 --> 00:38:33,602
Part of one big team.

525
00:38:33,676 --> 00:38:36,668
Bats himself the livelong day.

526
00:38:36,746 --> 00:38:39,681
Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and so on.

527
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:45,519
If his team don't field, what is he?

528
00:38:47,857 --> 00:38:49,290
You follow me?

529
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:50,916
No one.

530
00:38:52,628 --> 00:38:55,597
Sunny day, the stands are full of fans.

531
00:38:55,664 --> 00:38:58,098
What does he have to say?

532
00:38:59,568 --> 00:39:02,093
I'm going out there for myself.

533
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:05,473
But...

534
00:39:05,541 --> 00:39:10,035
I get nowhere unless the team wins.

535
00:39:10,112 --> 00:39:11,204
Team.

536
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,975
- Yeah, team.
- Team.

537
00:39:19,054 --> 00:39:20,988
Jesus Christ!

538
00:39:45,414 --> 00:39:48,315
Now I lay me down to sleep.

539
00:39:48,384 --> 00:39:51,547
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

540
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,021
If I should die before I wake,

541
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,355
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

542
00:39:58,427 --> 00:39:59,416
Amen.

543
00:39:59,495 --> 00:40:00,826
God bless.

544
00:40:00,896 --> 00:40:04,354
God bless Mommy. God bless Daddy.
God bless Dolly.

545
00:40:04,433 --> 00:40:05,365
Amen.

546
00:40:05,434 --> 00:40:06,366
Amen.

547
00:40:16,145 --> 00:40:17,578
Good night.

548
00:40:17,646 --> 00:40:19,079
Good night, Daddy.

549
00:40:19,148 --> 00:40:20,581
Good night, little girl.

550
00:40:20,649 --> 00:40:22,412
Can I have an Eskimo?

551
00:40:22,485 --> 00:40:23,417
And butterfly.

552
00:40:33,596 --> 00:40:35,029
Where are you going?

553
00:40:35,097 --> 00:40:36,029
What?

554
00:40:38,601 --> 00:40:40,034
Where are you going?

555
00:40:40,102 --> 00:40:42,036
I thought I'd go downstairs.

556
00:40:42,104 --> 00:40:44,038
Do some work for tomorrow.

557
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:47,041
You had a full day today, didn't you?

558
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:48,542
Yes, I certainly did.

559
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:51,045
You still got some energy left?

560
00:40:51,113 --> 00:40:52,546
Oh, lot of work.

561
00:40:52,615 --> 00:40:56,551
Well, why don't you come up and brush my hair,

562
00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:58,211
you detective?

563
00:41:11,634 --> 00:41:13,067
How are we doing?

564
00:41:13,135 --> 00:41:15,501
Capone's organization is incredibly diverse.

565
00:41:15,571 --> 00:41:17,004
Look at this.

566
00:41:17,072 --> 00:41:19,506
It owns Canadian Holding Company Associations,

567
00:41:19,575 --> 00:41:22,510
which owns in turn Green Light Laundry,

568
00:41:22,578 --> 00:41:24,068
Midwest Cab, Jollytime Playthings...

569
00:41:24,146 --> 00:41:25,113
Jollytime Playthings?

570
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,579
Yes, Jollytime Playthings.

571
00:41:26,649 --> 00:41:30,176
Remind me to get a present for my daughter.

572
00:41:30,252 --> 00:41:31,617
Bahamas Ship-to-Shore...

573
00:41:31,687 --> 00:41:33,120
The list is endless.

574
00:41:33,188 --> 00:41:35,053
All the business is legitimate.

575
00:41:35,124 --> 00:41:37,058
Capone owns none of it.

576
00:41:37,126 --> 00:41:40,061
We can get him on income tax evasion

577
00:41:40,129 --> 00:41:43,064
if we can show that he's getting money

578
00:41:43,132 --> 00:41:44,429
from the organization's business.

579
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,628
See, legally he receives no income.

580
00:41:47,703 --> 00:41:49,136
He doesn't receive anything?

581
00:41:49,204 --> 00:41:50,136
[Knock Knock]

582
00:41:50,205 --> 00:41:52,639
Mr. Ness, you have a visitor.

583
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:55,142
Mr. Ness, could we talk?

584
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,905
John O'Shea, alderman.

585
00:41:56,979 --> 00:41:58,913
I know who you are.

586
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,783
Would you excuse us?

587
00:42:05,654 --> 00:42:08,589
We have several large operations in the works.

588
00:42:08,657 --> 00:42:10,591
What can I do for you?

589
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:13,093
I came up to congratulate you

590
00:42:13,162 --> 00:42:15,460
on a job well done,

591
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:19,797
share your good fortune on such a lovely day.

592
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:25,236
What's that?

593
00:42:29,612 --> 00:42:31,136
What is that?

594
00:42:31,213 --> 00:42:33,477
Mr. Ness, you're an educated man.

595
00:42:33,549 --> 00:42:36,541
Let me pay you the compliment of being blunt.

596
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:38,109
There is a large,

597
00:42:38,187 --> 00:42:40,587
a large and popular business

598
00:42:40,656 --> 00:42:42,886
which you are causing dismay.

599
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:45,893
Why don't you just cross the street

600
00:42:45,961 --> 00:42:48,395
and let things take their course?

601
00:42:48,464 --> 00:42:50,898
Would you come in here please?

602
00:42:55,804 --> 00:42:57,237
In Roman times,

603
00:42:57,306 --> 00:42:58,739
when a fella was convicted

604
00:42:58,807 --> 00:43:01,241
of trying to bribe a public official,

605
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:05,246
they'd sew him in a bag with a wild animal

606
00:43:05,314 --> 00:43:07,748
and throw that bag in the river.

607
00:43:07,816 --> 00:43:09,147
You tell your master

608
00:43:09,218 --> 00:43:11,948
that we must agree to disagree.

609
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:15,022
You're making a mistake.

610
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,820
I've made them before.
I'm beginning to enjoy them.

611
00:43:17,893 --> 00:43:19,588
You're untouchable, is that it?

612
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:21,220
No one can get to you?

613
00:43:21,296 --> 00:43:22,729
And you tell Capone...

614
00:43:22,798 --> 00:43:24,527
Everyone can be gotten to.

615
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,329
I'll see him in hell.

616
00:43:28,504 --> 00:43:29,937
Hey, nice house.

617
00:43:30,005 --> 00:43:31,836
I said nice house.

618
00:43:31,907 --> 00:43:33,340
You live there?

619
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:37,235
Little girl's having a birthday, huh?

620
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:40,732
Yes.

621
00:43:40,775 --> 00:43:43,073
Nice to have a family.

622
00:43:45,614 --> 00:43:47,104
Yes, it is.

623
00:43:48,483 --> 00:43:50,917
A man should take care,

624
00:43:50,986 --> 00:43:53,420
see that nothing happens to them.

625
00:44:08,036 --> 00:44:09,298
Katherine!

626
00:44:11,706 --> 00:44:13,037
Katherine!

627
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,541
Where's the baby?

628
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:16,236
She's upstairs. Eliot...

629
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,312
Ohh...

630
00:44:19,381 --> 00:44:20,313
Daddy.

631
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,310
Ohh, yes.

632
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,724
What were you doing up?

633
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:32,726
I had to finish my ironing.

634
00:44:32,794 --> 00:44:33,818
You did?

635
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,065
You're going to come with Daddy now, O.K.?

636
00:44:49,744 --> 00:44:50,870
Eliot.

637
00:44:50,946 --> 00:44:52,379
O.K., it's all right.

638
00:44:52,447 --> 00:44:54,312
O.K., let's go.

639
00:44:54,382 --> 00:44:55,610
Stay there!

640
00:44:55,684 --> 00:44:58,744
Keep your eye on the street.

641
00:45:00,355 --> 00:45:01,379
Where's Malone?

642
00:45:01,456 --> 00:45:04,391
He's on the stakeout.
He'll be right here.

643
00:45:04,459 --> 00:45:05,391
Who's he?

644
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,588
One of the men on his list. He's O.K.

645
00:45:08,663 --> 00:45:11,598
All right, then.
Drive them to the station.

646
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:14,601
She'll tell you where to go when you're there.

647
00:45:14,669 --> 00:45:16,102
Take off your hat.

648
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:19,106
Anything happens, you shoot first,
you understand me?

649
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,607
Yes, Mr. Ness.

650
00:45:25,447 --> 00:45:26,914
Kiss.

651
00:45:26,982 --> 00:45:28,711
Eskimo and butterfly, Dad.

652
00:45:28,783 --> 00:45:29,715
O.K.

653
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,917
Now, go.

654
00:45:57,912 --> 00:45:59,812
Malone.

655
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:01,314
Are you O.K.?

656
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:04,318
They're fine.
Are you sure the cop's O.K.?

657
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,820
He better be.
He's my cousin.

658
00:46:06,888 --> 00:46:08,822
I want to hurt the man.

659
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:11,825
I want to start taking the battle to him.

660
00:46:11,893 --> 00:46:14,828
Then merry Christmas because
we've got great news.

661
00:46:14,896 --> 00:46:15,828
Tell him.

662
00:46:15,897 --> 00:46:17,831
There's a huge international shipment

663
00:46:17,899 --> 00:46:18,957
coming through.

664
00:46:19,034 --> 00:46:22,492
We got the time, the place, the whole shebang.

665
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:25,505
Well, what are we doing standing here then?

666
00:46:27,008 --> 00:46:28,942
How do you get this information?

667
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:31,444
That's the second rule of police work.

668
00:46:31,513 --> 00:46:35,279
If you want to keep a secret,
don't tell the boss.

669
00:46:39,487 --> 00:46:42,923
You know he's making over $3 million a year?

670
00:46:42,991 --> 00:46:44,925
But he's paid no taxes.

671
00:46:44,993 --> 00:46:46,426
Nothing's in his name.

672
00:46:46,494 --> 00:46:49,429
If we can establish any payments to him,

673
00:46:49,497 --> 00:46:52,432
we can prosecute him for income tax evasion.

674
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,432
What?

675
00:46:53,501 --> 00:46:55,935
I said we can prosecute him

676
00:46:56,004 --> 00:46:58,165
for income tax evasion.

677
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:01,436
Try a murderer for not paying his taxes?

678
00:47:01,509 --> 00:47:03,500
Well, it's better than nothing.

679
00:47:05,313 --> 00:47:09,977
All right. How do we link him to the money?

680
00:47:10,051 --> 00:47:11,518
I don't know.

681
00:47:14,022 --> 00:47:15,853
Go to sleep, Oscar.

682
00:48:03,092 --> 00:48:04,889
A convoy of 5 to 10 trucks

683
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,393
filled with Canadian whiskey

684
00:48:06,462 --> 00:48:09,898
will be met by someone from
the Capone organization.

685
00:48:09,965 --> 00:48:11,398
He'll bring with him

686
00:48:11,467 --> 00:48:14,402
full payment for the shipment in cash.

687
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:17,837
The meet is to occur just over the border,

688
00:48:17,907 --> 00:48:19,374
on the American side.

689
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:23,309
Our aim is to confiscate the liquor and the cash.

690
00:48:23,379 --> 00:48:24,937
Captain.

691
00:48:25,014 --> 00:48:27,312
We will await their signal.

692
00:48:27,383 --> 00:48:29,817
When they are on the road

693
00:48:29,885 --> 00:48:31,819
and have given the signal,

694
00:48:31,887 --> 00:48:35,323
we'll engage from the
Canadian side of the bridge,

695
00:48:35,391 --> 00:48:37,325
thus surprising from the rear,

696
00:48:37,393 --> 00:48:40,556
and surprise, Mr. Ness, is half the battle.

697
00:48:40,629 --> 00:48:43,723
Yes, surprise is half the battle.

698
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:46,199
Many things are half the battle.

699
00:48:46,268 --> 00:48:49,704
Let's think about what is all the battle.

700
00:48:49,772 --> 00:48:53,003
Let's take the fight to them, gentlemen!

701
00:48:53,075 --> 00:48:54,565
Thank you, Captain.

702
00:48:56,912 --> 00:48:58,709
All right.

703
00:48:58,781 --> 00:49:00,442
Move out.

704
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:18,900
Take it easy.

705
00:49:21,036 --> 00:49:22,469
Take it easy.

706
00:49:22,538 --> 00:49:25,598
It'll all happen in time, hmm?

707
00:49:25,674 --> 00:49:27,505
This is the job.

708
00:49:27,576 --> 00:49:30,010
Don't wait for it to happen.

709
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,513
Don't even want it to happen.

710
00:49:32,581 --> 00:49:35,175
Just watch what does happen.

711
00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:38,052
Are you my tutor?

712
00:49:39,655 --> 00:49:40,815
Yes, sir,

713
00:49:40,889 --> 00:49:42,322
that I am.

714
00:49:45,294 --> 00:49:47,228
Did you check it already?

715
00:49:47,296 --> 00:49:48,729
Yes, I did.

716
00:49:48,797 --> 00:49:50,526
Then leave it alone.

717
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:53,727
You're a good cop, Giuseppe.

718
00:49:53,802 --> 00:49:56,737
You're doing good.
You're going to do just fine.

719
00:49:59,908 --> 00:50:01,842
Now, Wallace, are you cold?

720
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:02,842
Mm.

721
00:50:02,911 --> 00:50:04,845
Yes, I am a little.

722
00:50:04,913 --> 00:50:06,346
Then stamp your feet.

723
00:50:06,415 --> 00:50:07,848
It'll keep you warm.

724
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:10,851
You learn something 20 years walking a beat.

725
00:50:10,919 --> 00:50:11,851
[Stamps Feet]

726
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,852
Snitches and...

727
00:50:12,921 --> 00:50:14,513
standing in the rain.

728
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:17,525
[Stamps Feet]

729
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,412
Listen, Mr. Ness.

730
00:50:46,488 --> 00:50:48,285
Mm-hmm?

731
00:50:48,357 --> 00:50:50,382
I had an idea.

732
00:50:50,459 --> 00:50:51,824
Shh. Shh.

733
00:51:44,413 --> 00:51:47,348
You all have your spare shells, huh?

734
00:52:02,931 --> 00:52:05,399
If you have to fire,

735
00:52:05,467 --> 00:52:07,958
hold low and squeeze

736
00:52:08,036 --> 00:52:10,504
and put your man down.

737
00:52:13,142 --> 00:52:15,804
'Cause he'd do the same to you.

738
00:52:15,878 --> 00:52:17,436
Shoot to kill.

739
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:19,674
You hear what I said?

740
00:52:19,748 --> 00:52:22,182
Yes, I did.
Shoot to kill.

741
00:52:24,386 --> 00:52:25,853
Let's go.

742
00:52:49,444 --> 00:52:50,570
[Neigh]

743
00:52:50,646 --> 00:52:52,204
Easy.

744
00:52:52,281 --> 00:52:55,808
The Canadians won't show
until I flash the badge.

745
00:52:55,884 --> 00:52:59,843

We'll let it ring...

933
01:03:51,296 --> 01:03:52,228
Twice.

934
01:03:52,297 --> 01:03:53,229
From...

935
01:03:53,298 --> 01:03:54,230
The corner.

936
01:03:54,299 --> 01:03:55,231
Anybody knocks...

937
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,564
Come out shooting.
I got it.

938
01:03:57,635 --> 01:04:00,399
You enjoy the tactical
aspects of law enforcement?

939
01:04:00,471 --> 01:04:03,565
Yeah. It's much more diverting than accounting.

940
01:04:03,641 --> 01:04:06,235
I been good to you.
You got to be good to me.

941
01:04:06,311 --> 01:04:09,576
We made a deal.
We'll stick to it, O.K.?

942
01:04:14,919 --> 01:04:17,854
Oh, yes. Much more diverting than accounting.

943
01:04:17,922 --> 01:04:19,685
O.K. We see youse tonight.

944
01:04:19,757 --> 01:04:20,689
Yeah. O.K.

945
01:04:20,758 --> 01:04:23,693
All right.
All the way down. No stops.

946
01:04:28,933 --> 01:04:30,423
When he sees error...

947
01:04:30,501 --> 01:04:32,696
when he sees crime...

948
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:35,705
he can say I will speak up.

949
01:04:35,773 --> 01:04:38,708
Before you go, I got one more question.

950
01:04:38,776 --> 01:04:42,542
I must commend the excellent work

951
01:04:42,614 --> 01:04:45,879
of Eliot Ness and his squad of untouchables.

952
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:50,815
What was it, boy or girl?

953
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:51,820
Boy.

954
01:04:51,889 --> 01:04:53,379
Congratulations.
What's his name?

955
01:04:53,458 --> 01:04:54,390
John.

956
01:04:54,459 --> 01:04:55,391
John?

957
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:56,392
Yeah.

958
01:04:56,461 --> 01:04:57,553
John James.

959
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:00,063
So she's O.K.?

960
01:05:00,131 --> 01:05:01,564
Yeah, she's O.K.

961
01:05:01,633 --> 01:05:04,898
She said she wants to repaint the whole house.

962
01:05:04,969 --> 01:05:08,063
Then it will be too small.
You'll have to move.

963
01:05:08,139 --> 01:05:09,401
Exactly.

964
01:05:09,474 --> 01:05:11,169
Oh, goodness.

965
01:05:11,242 --> 01:05:13,176
It's nice to be married.

966
01:05:13,244 --> 01:05:15,337
If you can stand the pain.

967
01:05:15,413 --> 01:05:17,176
Mr. Burns, where's Mr. Wallace?

968
01:05:17,248 --> 01:05:21,844
Didn't you see them?
They just went down the service elevator.

969
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,409
Very good.

970
01:05:23,488 --> 01:05:25,854
Keep an eye out, you hear?

971
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:28,892
I'm telling you they're going to send someone.

972
01:05:37,602 --> 01:05:39,695
Did he say the service elevator?

973
01:05:39,771 --> 01:05:40,703
Yes.

974
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:48,043
Wallace?

975
01:05:48,112 --> 01:05:49,044
Wallace!

976
01:05:49,113 --> 01:05:50,546
Let's take the stairs.

977
01:06:30,488 --> 01:06:31,420
Oh.

978
01:06:31,489 --> 01:06:32,421
No.

979
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:34,583
No.

980
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:35,751
Easy.

981
01:06:35,827 --> 01:06:36,759
Easy!

982
01:06:39,163 --> 01:06:40,095
Oscar.

983
01:07:20,805 --> 01:07:22,796
Lord Jesus.

984
01:07:26,444 --> 01:07:28,378
You going to be all right?

985
01:07:39,257 --> 01:07:41,191
Mr. Ness.

986
01:07:46,764 --> 01:07:47,992
Ah.

987
01:07:49,267 --> 01:07:50,700
It's always a crime

988
01:07:50,768 --> 01:07:54,033
when a young guy goes down on the lines.

989
01:07:55,273 --> 01:07:58,936
I'd hate to see it happen to someone I know.

990
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:02,207
Sometimes it's better not to get involved.

991
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,372
Jimmy.

992
01:08:05,116 --> 01:08:06,549
Take a day off.

993
01:08:06,617 --> 01:08:08,881
Leave the city for a while.

994
01:08:08,953 --> 01:08:10,887
You know what I mean?

995
01:08:27,805 --> 01:08:28,999
Al Capone.

996
01:08:29,073 --> 01:08:30,335
We have no Mr. ...

997
01:08:30,408 --> 01:08:31,340
Get him.

998
01:08:31,409 --> 01:08:32,341
We have no...

999
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:33,877
I said, goddamn it,

1000
01:08:33,945 --> 01:08:35,913
I said...

1001
01:08:42,286 --> 01:08:44,015
Something you want here?

1002
01:08:44,088 --> 01:08:46,079
My friend was killed today.

1003
01:08:46,157 --> 01:08:47,317
I don't care.

1004
01:08:47,391 --> 01:08:48,949
You don't care.

1005
01:08:51,462 --> 01:08:53,020
Now he does.

1006
01:08:53,097 --> 01:08:54,530
Come on, Capone.

1007
01:08:54,599 --> 01:08:56,362
You want to fight?

1008
01:08:56,434 --> 01:08:58,368
You and me, right here.

1009
01:08:58,436 --> 01:09:00,233
That's it. Come on!

1010
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:03,967
What's the matter, you afraid
to stand up for yourself?

1011
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:05,508
You want it now?

1012
01:09:05,576 --> 01:09:06,508
Let's go.

1013
01:09:06,577 --> 01:09:08,169
You son of a bitch.

1014
01:09:08,246 --> 01:09:10,305
What?

1015
01:09:10,381 --> 01:09:13,612
You talk to me like that
in front of my son? Fuck you!

1016
01:09:14,685 --> 01:09:16,619
Eliot! It's me.

1017
01:09:16,687 --> 01:09:17,619
It's me.

1018
01:09:17,688 --> 01:09:19,246
Not this way.

1019
01:09:19,323 --> 01:09:20,620
Not this way.

1020
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:24,821
You fuck. You got nothing.
A lot of talk and a badge.

1021
01:09:24,896 --> 01:09:26,796
You hear?
You got nothing.

1022
01:09:26,864 --> 01:09:28,627
Nothing in court, no bookkeeper.

1023
01:09:28,699 --> 01:09:30,132
You got nothing!

1024
01:09:30,201 --> 01:09:31,133
Nothing!

1025
01:09:31,202 --> 01:09:34,171
If you were a man, you'd have done it.

1026
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:35,170
You punk!

1027
01:09:44,382 --> 01:09:47,317
No, I...
No, I understand.

1028
01:09:47,385 --> 01:09:50,320
Believe me... I understand.

1029
01:09:58,129 --> 01:09:59,562
Well, what's happened?

1030
01:10:03,401 --> 01:10:05,835
He says he can't be unprotected.

1031
01:10:08,406 --> 01:10:11,170
What is it that the guy says?

1032
01:10:11,242 --> 01:10:14,837
He says he won't make a fool out of himself.

1033
01:10:14,912 --> 01:10:17,676
He won't go into court without a witness.

1034
01:10:17,748 --> 01:10:19,682
Tomorrow the D.A.'s going to announce

1035
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:21,684
that he's dropping the case.

1036
01:10:21,752 --> 01:10:23,185
He's going to give up?

1037
01:10:23,254 --> 01:10:24,448
I didn't say that.

1038
01:10:24,522 --> 01:10:25,853
He's got no witness.

1039
01:10:25,923 --> 01:10:27,185
We have Wallace's files...

1040
01:10:27,258 --> 01:10:28,384
[Telephone Rings]

1041
01:10:28,459 --> 01:10:33,453
There's a time when you have to cut your losses.

1042
01:10:33,531 --> 01:10:34,623
Hello.

1043
01:10:37,868 --> 01:10:38,800
Hello.

1044
01:10:41,667 --> 01:10:42,634
Yes.

1045
01:10:46,371 --> 01:10:48,805
No, he... he didn't have a family.

1046
01:10:52,211 --> 01:10:53,803
How is everything there?

1047
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:01,645
N-no, y-no, you do it however you want.

1048
01:11:03,822 --> 01:11:06,313
I... I promise I will.

1049
01:11:06,391 --> 01:11:08,825
You give her my love.

1050
01:11:08,894 --> 01:11:10,828
I love you, too.

1051
01:11:13,832 --> 01:11:14,821
Mr. Ness,

1052
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,834
we got a ledger here

1053
01:11:16,902 --> 01:11:19,336
listing payments to Chicago city officials.

1054
01:11:19,404 --> 01:11:20,996
There's Al Capone, Frank Nitti...

1055
01:11:21,073 --> 01:11:23,337
I think that's enough for today.

1056
01:11:23,408 --> 01:11:24,773
I know, but...

1057
01:11:24,843 --> 01:11:26,936
That will do.
Thank you.

1058
01:11:27,012 --> 01:11:29,606
I'd like to request to stick around.

1059
01:11:32,684 --> 01:11:34,311
We got to bust these guys.

1060
01:11:34,386 --> 01:11:35,318
I know.

1061
01:11:43,862 --> 01:11:45,227
Is that it?

1062
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,325
I'm sorry?

1063
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,799
You heard me.

1064
01:11:49,868 --> 01:11:51,460
My question is,

1065
01:11:51,536 --> 01:11:52,798
are we done?

1066
01:11:54,039 --> 01:11:56,007
Yes, I think we're done.

1067
01:11:56,074 --> 01:11:58,508
You're saying we sat in at a game

1068
01:11:58,577 --> 01:11:59,976
that was above our heads.

1069
01:12:00,045 --> 01:12:02,809
It appears so.
Mr. Wallace would agree.

1070
01:12:02,881 --> 01:12:03,813
He's dead!

1071
01:12:03,882 --> 01:12:06,146
And the D.A.'s dropping the case.

1072
01:12:06,218 --> 01:12:08,652
He won't go into court without a witness

1073
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,086
nor without Capone's bookkeeper Walter Payne.

1074
01:12:11,156 --> 01:12:13,147
What will you do now?

1075
01:12:13,225 --> 01:12:16,126
What would you have me do?

1076
01:12:16,194 --> 01:12:18,992
I've taken this as far as it can go.

1077
01:12:32,110 --> 01:12:33,873
What did your wife want?

1078
01:12:33,945 --> 01:12:37,608
She wanted to know if I was...

1079
01:12:37,683 --> 01:12:39,344
My wife?

1080
01:12:39,418 --> 01:12:40,817
Yeah.

1081
01:12:44,156 --> 01:12:47,683
Uh, she wanted to know if I was all right.

1082
01:12:49,361 --> 01:12:52,296
It's nice being married, eh?

1083
01:12:53,632 --> 01:12:54,564
Yes.

1084
01:12:54,633 --> 01:12:56,464
She's sitting in some room

1085
01:12:56,535 --> 01:12:58,799
surrounded by people she doesn't know

1086
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:00,303
going over...

1087
01:13:00,372 --> 01:13:02,966
kitchen color charts or something.

1088
01:13:09,548 --> 01:13:11,482
Some part of the world...

1089
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:14,485
still cares what color the kitchen is.

1090
01:13:19,725 --> 01:13:21,659
Eliot.

1091
01:13:21,727 --> 01:13:24,059
Do one more thing for me.

1092
01:13:26,131 --> 01:13:30,295
Get back to the D.A.
And stall him.

1093
01:13:30,369 --> 01:13:33,065
Wait a minute.
Stall him with what?

1094
01:13:33,138 --> 01:13:35,106
Just do as I say.

1095
01:13:38,043 --> 01:13:40,978
I think I know how to find this guy.

1096
01:13:42,881 --> 01:13:43,939
Walter.

1097
01:13:45,984 --> 01:13:47,508
Al says we're leaving town

1098
01:13:47,586 --> 01:13:50,987
until he can fix this subpoena thing.

1099
01:13:51,056 --> 01:13:52,489
We're leaving tonight.

1100
01:13:57,195 --> 01:13:58,856
2-ball down.

1101
01:14:04,102 --> 01:14:06,900
Mike, you got a minute?

1102
01:14:06,972 --> 01:14:09,406
Well, I do now, don't I?

1103
01:14:10,742 --> 01:14:14,769
What are you doing in the club for cops?

1104
01:14:14,846 --> 01:14:17,747
This is a place for cops.

1105
01:14:17,816 --> 01:14:19,283
Can we step outside?

1106
01:14:20,519 --> 01:14:21,952
All right. All right.

1107
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:24,955
But I got nothing to say to you.

1108
01:14:27,626 --> 01:14:31,653
Where the hell are we going, for a swim?

1109
01:14:31,730 --> 01:14:34,164
Get out of the rain, fool.

1110
01:14:36,701 --> 01:14:37,759
What?

1111
01:14:37,836 --> 01:14:39,201
What?

1112
01:14:39,271 --> 01:14:42,206
I just need one more piece of information.

1113
01:14:42,274 --> 01:14:43,206
One more?

1114
01:14:43,275 --> 01:14:44,207
I need...

1115

1298
01:31:15,651 --> 01:31:18,643
Is there some problem I can help you with?

1299
01:31:18,721 --> 01:31:19,653
No.

1300
01:31:19,722 --> 01:31:21,189
No.

1301
01:31:21,257 --> 01:31:23,725
I really can't thank you enough.

1302
01:31:28,764 --> 01:31:30,197
Isn't this fun?

1303
01:31:30,266 --> 01:31:33,895
Oh, you're being such a good boy, sweetheart.

1304
01:31:33,970 --> 01:31:35,369
Thank you again.

1305
01:31:35,438 --> 01:31:37,099
This is so wonderful.

1306
01:31:39,742 --> 01:31:41,505
Oh, thank you, sir.

1307
01:31:50,953 --> 01:31:52,944
I'll take him from here.

1308
01:31:53,022 --> 01:31:54,956
You've been a great help.

1309
01:31:55,024 --> 01:31:56,457
Thank you so much.

1310
01:31:56,525 --> 01:31:57,992
Almost there.

1311
01:31:59,328 --> 01:32:01,523
I'll take it from here.

1312
01:32:01,597 --> 01:32:04,157
Thank you very much for your help.

1313
01:32:04,233 --> 01:32:05,598
Thank you, sir.

[Baby Cries]

1315
01:32:07,536 --> 01:32:08,969
Oh, don't cry, sweetheart.

1316
01:32:09,038 --> 01:32:11,404
We're almost home.

1317
01:32:11,474 --> 01:32:13,465
Is something wrong?

1318
01:32:15,544 --> 01:32:17,273
Sir?

1319
01:34:13,058 --> 01:34:15,856
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

1320
01:34:15,928 --> 01:34:17,361
What are you doing?

1321
01:34:17,429 --> 01:34:18,361
Shut up!

1322
01:34:18,430 --> 01:34:20,091
I said shut up!

1323
01:34:20,165 --> 01:34:22,099
[Babbles]

1324
01:34:23,669 --> 01:34:25,296
- What are you doing?
- Shut the fuck up!

1325
01:34:25,370 --> 01:34:26,234
Hold it!

1326
01:34:27,706 --> 01:34:29,833
Hold it.

1327
01:34:29,975 --> 01:34:31,237
My baby!

1328
01:34:31,310 --> 01:34:32,607
Stay there.
He's O.K.

1329
01:34:34,313 --> 01:34:35,302
Shut up!

1330
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:37,177
I said hold it!

1331
01:34:37,249 --> 01:34:38,238
What the...

1332
01:34:38,317 --> 01:34:41,252
See, I'm walking out with the bookkeeper.

1333
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:44,255
And the bookkeeper and me are driving away.

1334
01:34:47,359 --> 01:34:49,190
Or else he dies.

1335
01:34:49,261 --> 01:34:50,387
He dies.

1336
01:34:50,462 --> 01:34:52,396
And you ain't got nothing.

1337
01:34:55,467 --> 01:34:59,062
You got five seconds to make up your mind.

1338
01:34:59,138 --> 01:35:02,574
I'll tell you what you want to know.

1339
01:35:02,641 --> 01:35:05,075
Shut up!
I'm not kidding, Ness!

1340
01:35:05,144 --> 01:35:08,409
I'll tell you what you want to know!

1341
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:10,107
You got him?

1342
01:35:10,182 --> 01:35:12,116
Yeah, I got him.

1343
01:35:16,688 --> 01:35:17,848
1 !

1344
01:35:17,923 --> 01:35:19,185
Will you stop it?

1345
01:35:25,798 --> 01:35:26,730
Take him.

1346
01:35:29,101 --> 01:35:30,398
2.

1347
01:35:57,796 --> 01:36:00,594
The two coded entries in this ledger

1348
01:36:00,666 --> 01:36:03,032
represent cash disbursement

1349
01:36:03,101 --> 01:36:05,501
to all levels of city officials,

1350
01:36:05,571 --> 01:36:07,664
members of the police,

1351
01:36:07,739 --> 01:36:11,641
and to Alphonse Capone.

1352
01:36:13,245 --> 01:36:14,269
That's correct.

1353
01:36:14,346 --> 01:36:15,540
Excuse me?

1354
01:36:17,416 --> 01:36:19,907
I said that is correct.

1355
01:36:19,985 --> 01:36:24,479
And you will decipher these coded entries for us.

1356
01:36:27,292 --> 01:36:29,317
I will.

1357
01:36:29,394 --> 01:36:32,329
Sorry, Mr. Payne.
I can't hear you.

1358
01:36:32,397 --> 01:36:33,830
I said I will.

1359
01:36:35,167 --> 01:36:38,933
You were in charge of disbursements
for Mr. Capone?

1360
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:41,536
Yes, I was.

1361
01:36:41,607 --> 01:36:44,940
And you personally distributed monies...

1362
01:36:45,010 --> 01:36:49,140
vast, undeclared monies...

1363
01:36:49,214 --> 01:36:51,011
to Mr. Capone?

1364
01:36:52,217 --> 01:36:53,809
Yes, I did.

1365
01:36:55,254 --> 01:36:57,085
Would you tell us the amounts?

1366
01:36:59,091 --> 01:37:01,616
In a three-year period,

1367
01:37:01,693 --> 01:37:05,823
I personally disbursed monies to Mr. Capone

1368
01:37:05,898 --> 01:37:10,562
in excess of $1.3 million.

1369
01:37:13,372 --> 01:37:16,341
Would you repeat that amount, please?

1370
01:37:17,542 --> 01:37:20,739
$1.3 million.

1371
01:37:20,812 --> 01:37:23,372
Thank you very much.

1372
01:37:38,597 --> 01:37:40,428
I don't understand it.

1373
01:37:40,499 --> 01:37:41,932
What does Capone have?

1374
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,936
We're nailing the lid
on his coffin, and he's smiling.

1375
01:38:08,293 --> 01:38:11,626
He's wearing a gun in court.

1376
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,659
Get me the bailiff.

1377
01:38:19,404 --> 01:38:21,372
It'll be a fast trial.

1378
01:38:24,109 --> 01:38:27,875
The man in the front row wearing the white suit

1379
01:38:27,946 --> 01:38:29,413
is carrying a gun.

1380
01:38:29,481 --> 01:38:32,245
I don't want this to turn into something.

1381
01:38:32,317 --> 01:38:35,582
When you get him up, I'll lead you out.

1382
01:38:40,892 --> 01:38:43,827
Could we speak to you a minute, please?

1383
01:39:12,910 --> 01:39:14,343
Get up against it.

Who the hell are you?

1385
01:39:15,913 --> 01:39:17,847
You heard him.
Up against it.

1386
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:20,440
What's this?

1387
01:39:20,518 --> 01:39:24,284
Empty all your pockets.
On the table. All of it.

1388
01:39:24,355 --> 01:39:26,619
I got a permit for that.

1389
01:39:26,691 --> 01:39:28,124
Fine. Let's see it.

1390
01:39:29,761 --> 01:39:32,696
You know, I'm not the one under indictment.

1391
01:39:32,764 --> 01:39:34,197
Everything on the table.

1392
01:39:37,568 --> 01:39:39,331
Give him his gun back.

1393
01:39:39,404 --> 01:39:40,666
"To whom it may concern...

I'm sorry, Mr. Ness.

01:39:50,181 --> 01:39:52,115
You'll have to give it back.

Fine.

01:39:53,351 --> 01:39:57,117

back into that courtroom.

a friend who lived there.

Don't.

1406
01:40:50,408 --> 01:40:51,841
Let him go.

1407

01:45:08,332 --> 01:45:11,495
Here I am, Treasury man.

What are you waiting for?

1415
01:45:18,676 --> 01:45:21,736
Don't just stand there.
Arrest me.

01:45:32,123 --> 01:45:33,090
Yeah?

1419
01:45:33,157 --> 01:45:37,059
I'll come see you burn, you son of a bitch,

1420
01:45:37,128 --> 01:45:39,688
'cause you killed my friend.

1421
01:45:39,764 --> 01:45:41,664
He died like a pig.

1422
01:45:41,732 --> 01:45:43,097
What did you say?

1423
01:45:43,167 --> 01:45:45,601
I said your friend died screaming

1424
01:45:45,670 --> 01:45:47,570

1425
01:45:47,638 --> 01:45:51,074

Mr. Ness, you doing O.K.?

I think you better see this.

1435
01:46:55,129 --> 01:46:56,562
What is it?

1436
01:46:56,630 --> 01:46:59,929
What is it? That's a jury list, Mr. Ness.

1437

They've been bribed.

1438

Got it out of Nitti's coat.

1439
01:47:03,938 --> 01:47:05,371
Where is Nitti?

1440
01:47:07,374 --> 01:47:08,807
He's in the car.

1441
01:47:28,262 --> 01:47:30,355
This constitutes no evidence.

1442
01:47:30,431 --> 01:47:31,420
It has no providence.

1443
01:47:31,498 --> 01:47:34,433
Your Honor, the truth of the case

1444
01:47:34,501 --> 01:47:38,437
is that Capone is a killer and will go free.

1445
01:47:38,505 --> 01:47:41,440
The only way to deal with such men

1446
01:47:41,508 --> 01:47:42,941
is hunt them down.

1447
01:47:43,010 --> 01:47:44,443
I have forsworn myself.

1448
01:47:44,511 --> 01:47:47,947
I have broken every law I swore to defend.

1449

I'm content I've done right.

1450
01:47:49,883 --> 01:47:52,716
That man must be stopped, and you must...

1451
01:47:52,786 --> 01:47:54,151
I'll be the judge

1452
01:47:54,221 --> 01:47:57,156
of what I must do, Mr. Ness.

1453
01:48:05,799 --> 01:48:07,699
Would you excuse us?

01:49:11,398 --> 01:49:12,365
Yes, sir?

1456
01:49:17,204 --> 01:49:20,037
Bailiff, go next door to Judge Hoffman's court.

1457
01:49:20,107 --> 01:49:22,871
They've just begun hearing a divorce action.

1458
01:49:22,943 --> 01:49:25,571
I want you to bring that jury in here

1459
01:49:25,646 --> 01:49:28,706
and take this jury to his court.

1460
01:49:30,484 --> 01:49:32,645
Bailiff, are those instructions clear?

1461
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:34,153
Yes, sir.
They're clear.

1462
01:49:38,425 --> 01:49:42,088
Bailiff, I want you to switch the juries.

1463
01:49:42,162 --> 01:49:44,426
Your Honor, I object.

1464
01:49:45,699 --> 01:49:46,723
Overruled.

1465
01:49:51,572 --> 01:49:53,540
What did you tell him?

1466
01:49:54,775 --> 01:49:58,802
I told him his name was in the ledger, too.

1467
01:49:58,879 --> 01:50:01,677
His name wasn't in the ledger.

1468
01:50:03,117 --> 01:50:06,280
Wait. What is this?
Is this the law?

1469
01:50:06,353 --> 01:50:07,547
You're out of order.

1470
01:50:07,621 --> 01:50:08,883
I think that we...

1471
01:50:08,956 --> 01:50:11,550
I don't care what you think.

1472
01:50:11,625 --> 01:50:14,355
What do I look like?
Do something.

1473
01:50:14,428 --> 01:50:15,395
Order!

1474
01:50:17,097 --> 01:50:18,086
Your Honor,

1475
01:50:18,165 --> 01:50:21,259
we'd like to withdraw our plea of not guilty

1476
01:50:21,335 --> 01:50:24,133
and enter a plea of guilty.

1477
01:50:27,341 --> 01:50:29,002
Guilty?

1478
01:50:29,076 --> 01:50:30,805
Order in the court!

1479
01:50:30,878 --> 01:50:31,845
Order!

1480
01:50:33,547 --> 01:50:36,141
Guilty?

1481
01:50:36,216 --> 01:50:37,683
I'll give you guilty.

1482
01:50:41,221 --> 01:50:42,381
Bailiff!

1483
01:50:44,258 --> 01:50:46,351
Bailiff, clear the courtroom!

1484
01:50:50,430 --> 01:50:53,661
Your Honor. Your Honor, is that justice?

1485
01:50:53,734 --> 01:50:56,726
Why did he switch the jury?

1486
01:50:56,804 --> 01:50:59,364
Are you going to continue
going after the organization?

1487
01:50:59,439 --> 01:51:00,929
Excuse me.

1488
01:51:01,008 --> 01:51:05,502
I'm asking Your Honor, is this justice?

1489
01:51:05,579 --> 01:51:07,638
What about justice?

1490
01:51:09,516 --> 01:51:11,507
Is this justice?

1491
01:51:11,585 --> 01:51:13,485
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1492
01:51:15,022 --> 01:51:18,856
Never stop. Never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

1493
01:51:18,926 --> 01:51:20,484
What did you say?

1494
01:51:20,561 --> 01:51:23,826
Never stop fighting till the fight is done.

1495
01:51:23,897 --> 01:51:24,829
What?

1496
01:51:24,898 --> 01:51:26,263
You heard me, Capone.

1497
01:51:26,333 --> 01:51:28,858
You're nothing but talk and a badge.

1498
01:51:28,936 --> 01:51:30,460
Here endeth the lesson.

1499
01:51:30,537 --> 01:51:34,633
You're nothing but a lot of talk and a badge!

1500
01:51:34,708 --> 01:51:37,905
You're nothing but a lot of talk and a badge!

1501
01:52:57,591 --> 01:52:59,786
So much violence.

1502
01:54:05,392 --> 01:54:07,053
Cleaning up a little.

1503
01:54:17,371 --> 01:54:19,339
I guess it's goodbye.

1504
01:54:21,175 --> 01:54:22,938
Goodbye, George.

1505
01:54:25,512 --> 01:54:29,141
I want to, uh, thank you for this.

1506
01:54:29,216 --> 01:54:31,582
No. Thank you.

1507
01:54:47,501 --> 01:54:48,900
Mr. Ness...

1508
01:54:48,969 --> 01:54:51,369
I think he wanted you to have that.

1509
01:54:51,438 --> 01:54:53,906
He'd have wanted a cop to have it.

1510
01:54:58,712 --> 01:55:00,145
I'm going home.

1511
01:55:12,092 --> 01:55:14,390
Mr. Ness, any comment for the record?

1512
01:55:14,461 --> 01:55:17,396
The man who put Al Capone on the spot.

1513
01:55:17,464 --> 01:55:21,127
I happened to be there when the wheel went round.

1514
01:55:21,201 --> 01:55:23,465
They say they're going to repeal prohibition.

1515
01:55:23,537 --> 01:55:25,971
What will you do then?

1516
01:55:27,307 --> 01:55:28,706
I think I'll have a drink.
