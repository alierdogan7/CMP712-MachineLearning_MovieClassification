01:59:09,660 --> 01:59:12,925
Did you say "Hey, homes" to Miklo,
homes, before you shot him?

1717
01:59:12,996 --> 01:59:16,432
- Hey, chill out, Chuey!
- He was a shooter in a robbery. I was doing my job.

1718
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:18,730
<i>Nobody has the right
to kill innocent people.</i>

1719
01:59:18,802 --> 01:59:22,499
<i>[Chuey] No, you're a pinche
vato vendido, puto!</i>

1720
01:59:22,572 --> 01:59:25,097
<i>- [Spits] Fucker!
- Hey! ¡Calmala!</i>

1721
01:59:25,175 --> 01:59:28,303
- Hey, fuckin' relax!
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

1722
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:32,844
Fuck you!
Fuck you, wimp!

1723
01:59:32,916 --> 01:59:36,875
Hey, homes, you can't come here anymore
unless you're gonna bust me!

1724
01:59:36,954 --> 01:59:39,684
Who the fuck gave you permission to use
my little brother in your paintings?

1725
01:59:39,756 --> 01:59:42,350
<i>I don't need permission from you.
He's my carnalito too!</i>

1726
01:59:42,426 --> 01:59:46,954
Don't you useJuanito as an excuse to
wreck your life. You don't have that right!

1727
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:52,291
<i>Si, culero.</i>

1728
01:59:52,369 --> 01:59:55,600
I don't have the right, huh?
Fuckin' right I don't.

1729
01:59:55,672 --> 01:59:58,197
You're fuckin' right
I don't have the right.

1730
01:59:58,275 --> 02:00:01,301
<i>I don't... I don't have
that fuckin'right.</i>

1731
02:00:01,378 --> 02:00:04,438
<i>You want him outta my painting, joto?
All right.</i>

1732
02:00:04,514 --> 02:00:08,473
<i>All right. There he is!
¡Ahi esta! ¡Toma!</i>

1733
02:00:08,552 --> 02:00:10,577
Take it, man!
Come on!

1734
02:00:10,654 --> 02:00:13,214
Juanito always loved me
more than you, homes.

1735
02:00:13,290 --> 02:00:17,920
<i>¡Tu te creias muy chingon! You were always
too much of a badass to love the little vato!</i>

1736
02:00:17,995 --> 02:00:21,590
Just like you are now. So much of a
fucking badass you kill your own people!

1737
02:00:21,665 --> 02:00:24,327
No!

1738
02:00:24,401 --> 02:00:27,632
Don't you ever say that to me again,
Cruzito. I let you say that once...

1739
02:00:27,704 --> 02:00:29,729
<i>¿Que, puto?
What the fuck?</i>

1740
02:00:29,806 --> 02:00:33,606
<i>You gonna kick my ass?
Well, ¡caiga! Let's get down.</i>

1741
02:00:33,677 --> 02:00:37,579
- Come on! You the badass!
- I don't wanna fight with you, little brother.

1742
02:00:37,647 --> 02:00:42,175
<i>To what, bust me? Well, come on,
gabacho. You the law. Do your job.</i>

1743
02:00:43,854 --> 02:00:46,015
Do your fucking job!

1744
02:01:15,619 --> 02:01:18,179
Look at this.

1745
02:01:18,255 --> 02:01:20,223
Look at that.

1746
02:01:21,224 --> 02:01:23,351
Must be
from Quentin, huh?

1747
02:01:25,695 --> 02:01:29,654
- Hey. Hey, he's the guy...
- PCP bust. That's Popeye Savedra.

1748
02:01:29,733 --> 02:01:32,395
Miklo's connected to him.

1749
02:01:32,469 --> 02:01:35,131
<i>"La Onda a toda madre
o un desmadre."</i>

1750
02:01:35,205 --> 02:01:37,196
<i>What's "Onda"?</i>

1751
02:01:37,274 --> 02:01:39,469
<i>No, La Onda.
It's your destiny, man.</i>

1752
02:01:39,543 --> 02:01:42,137
It's... It's like a wave
nothing can stop.

1753
02:01:42,212 --> 02:01:44,180
Uh, "madre" means mother.
So...

1754
02:01:44,247 --> 02:01:46,238
No, no, it's a lot more
complicated than that.

1755
02:01:46,316 --> 02:01:49,149
<i>This is some heavy shit,
all right? "A toda madre".</i>

1756
02:01:49,219 --> 02:01:51,517
<i>Everything is perfect.
It's like...</i>

1757
02:01:51,588 --> 02:01:53,613
your mother's love.

1758
02:01:53,690 --> 02:01:55,658
<i>And "un desmadre"...</i>

1759
02:01:57,094 --> 02:01:59,221
is like you have no mother.

1760
02:01:59,296 --> 02:02:01,491
It's absolute hatred.
Complete destruction.

1761
02:02:01,565 --> 02:02:04,466
<i>In other words, you win it all
or lose everything.</i>

1762
02:02:04,534 --> 02:02:07,002
Sweet bunch of guys.

1763
02:02:07,070 --> 02:02:10,904
This big fat pig, Popeye, right here in
the center? He's gotta be their leader.

1764
02:02:10,974 --> 02:02:14,102
<i>- Hey, Aguilar?
- Look at the way they're all grouped around him.</i>

1765
02:02:14,177 --> 02:02:18,841
Hey, Aguilar, that con you
blasted just got outta surgery.

1766
02:02:18,915 --> 02:02:21,884
He's gonna be a whole lot
easier to catch from now on.

1767
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:38,734
<i>Nurse, could you
give me a minute, please?</i>

1768
02:02:38,802 --> 02:02:40,770
Nurse?

1769
02:02:47,343 --> 02:02:50,710
<i>Por la Virgen, Miklo,
I did not know that it would...</i>

1770
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:54,580
<i>Don't talk to me about the Virgen.
Vatos Locos forever.</i>

1771
02:02:54,651 --> 02:02:57,848
That all died when you
pulled the trigger.

1772
02:03:06,029 --> 02:03:09,055
How did everything
get so fucked up, man?

1773
02:03:09,132 --> 02:03:11,396
<i>The pinche badge, ese.</i>

1774
02:03:13,269 --> 02:03:15,760
<i>You owe me, vendido!</i>

1775
02:03:17,140 --> 02:03:19,267
Who's the sellout?

1776
02:03:19,342 --> 02:03:21,469
You're tellin' me you're
workin' hard, goin' straight.

1777
02:03:21,544 --> 02:03:23,705
The next thing I know,
you're pointin' a.357 at me...

1778
02:03:23,780 --> 02:03:26,510
and there's two guys
dead on the ground.

1779
02:03:26,583 --> 02:03:30,110
I would have given you
anything, Miklo.

1780
02:03:30,186 --> 02:03:33,451
But you can't just
take away what I am.

1781
02:03:35,225 --> 02:03:37,989
You chose
the wrong side, ese.

1782
02:03:38,061 --> 02:03:41,121
There's too many of us.
You're gonna lose.

1783
02:03:41,197 --> 02:03:44,428
No, uh-uh. I don't forget
where I come from or who I am.

1784
02:03:44,500 --> 02:03:46,934
That's what keeps me goin'
every day.

1785
02:03:48,438 --> 02:03:52,465
- You don't wanna hear the truth, Paco.
- What truth?

1786
02:03:52,542 --> 02:03:55,067
This? La Onda.
Is this your truth?

1787
02:03:55,144 --> 02:03:58,307
<i>Two-bit punks like Popeye Savedra
with their PCPIabs?</i>

1788
02:03:58,381 --> 02:04:02,681
Or you, robbing Zody's
and killing innocent people?

1789
02:04:02,752 --> 02:04:04,845
If that's your truth, then you're
right. I don't wanna hear it.

1790
02:04:04,921 --> 02:04:08,084
<i>Get out, puto!
You're not my blood!</i>

1791
02:04:09,425 --> 02:04:11,893
I'm cutting you off
like they did my leg.

1792
02:04:14,063 --> 02:04:16,463
You don't exist
for me anymore.

1793
02:04:32,482 --> 02:04:36,179
<i>[Inmate] Miklo!
Orale, carnalito. What's up, ese?</i>

1794
02:04:36,252 --> 02:04:38,186
<i>You're looking good,
homey.</i>

1795
02:04:45,995 --> 02:04:51,433
<i>[Inmates Whistling,

1797
02:04:53,736 --> 02:04:57,331
You better tell Carlos he better
stop fucking with my business!

1798
02:04:57,407 --> 02:04:59,671
Pockets,
not in public!

1799
02:04:59,742 --> 02:05:02,438
<i>[Pockets] I ain't gonna let
no junkie rip-off my customers!</i>

1800

<i>[Guard] Velka, time to lock up!</i>

1801
02:05:04,514 --> 02:05:07,278
<i>Mira, mira.
It's the Bionic Man.</i>

1802
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:09,284
<i>[Miklo] Hey, Carlos,
what's with the B.G.A.?</i>

1803
02:05:09,352 --> 02:05:12,082
Pay no mind to cheap conversation.
They're just sore losers, ese.

1804
02:05:12,155 --> 02:05:15,784
- They're just flapping their crow wings.
- Pockets is on the warpath.

1805
02:05:15,858 --> 02:05:19,225
I can't help it if the customers
know where the quality is.

1806
02:05:19,295 --> 02:05:21,229
He's been selling 'em
baby powder.

1807
02:05:21,297 --> 02:05:24,095
I don't have all day, man.
Let's take it in.

1808
02:05:24,167 --> 02:05:27,102
Hey, Majito.
Gonna be cellies, huh?

1809
02:05:27,170 --> 02:05:29,661
<i>- Orale.
- [Guard] Move over here. Let me get these cuffs.</i>

1810
02:05:31,474 --> 02:05:34,409
<i>¡Orale! That's
a badass pano, homeboy.</i>

1811
02:05:34,477 --> 02:05:36,536
You been burnin'
them quills, huh?

1812
02:05:36,612 --> 02:05:39,604
- You're getting good.
- It's yours.

1813
02:05:42,952 --> 02:05:45,113
My "Home Sweet Home"
picture, huh?

1814
02:05:46,289 --> 02:05:48,382
At least this bum leg
got me something.

1815
02:05:48,458 --> 02:05:51,018
I get to work
at the law library.

1816
02:05:51,094 --> 02:05:54,393
What's all that mad-dogging
between Carlos and the B.G.A.?

1817
02:05:54,464 --> 02:05:57,262
The vato's got one
sweet cocaine connection.

1818
02:05:57,333 --> 02:06:00,769
Hmm. And he's moving in
on Pockets' customers.

1819
02:06:00,837 --> 02:06:03,271
How did he connect?

1820
02:06:03,339 --> 02:06:07,332
Nobody knows. But it's dynamite shit.
Pure Bolivian flake.

1821
02:06:07,410 --> 02:06:09,844
And Montana, he just stood by
and watched Carlos jump in?

1822
02:06:09,912 --> 02:06:12,540
<i>Plata talks.</i>

1823
02:06:12,615 --> 02:06:15,106
Carlos is recruiting
lots of soldiers...

1824
02:06:15,184 --> 02:06:18,676
and buying influence on the council
to try to neutralize Montana.

1825
02:06:18,755 --> 02:06:21,189
Says it's his own personal trip,
not Onda's!

1826
02:06:21,257 --> 02:06:25,318
That's bullshit! Personal trips
is what's fucking Onda up!

1827
02:06:25,395 --> 02:06:27,659
[Groaning]
I saw that out on the streets.

1828
02:06:27,730 --> 02:06:30,460
We're cutting
our own throats.

1829
02:06:34,904 --> 02:06:36,997
<i>It's too soon
to be walking on it.</i>

1830
02:06:37,073 --> 02:06:39,041
It's a long way up.

1831
02:06:39,108 --> 02:06:42,771
But there's no way they're gonna stick
me down there on the first tier without...

1832
02:06:42,845 --> 02:06:45,040
<i>ah, my carnales.</i>

1833
02:06:45,114 --> 02:06:47,173
Ah!

1834
02:06:48,618 --> 02:06:50,552
Your own cousin did that.

1835
02:06:52,688 --> 02:06:55,248
<i>- We should put a hit on that puto.
- No, he's mine.</i>

1836
02:06:55,324 --> 02:06:58,452
His payback's
gonna take time.

1837
02:06:58,528 --> 02:07:02,726
I'm gonna make him sorry
he ever fucked with my business.

<i>Hey, puto.</i>

1839
02:07:04,867 --> 02:07:06,835
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, chorizo?

1840
02:07:06,903 --> 02:07:08,894
Trying to jump-start
your memory, punk.

1841
02:07:08,971 --> 02:07:11,599
Turn your ass around.
Where the fuck is Popeye Savedra?

1842
02:07:11,674 --> 02:07:13,642
I ain't seen the vato.
He took off.

1843
02:07:13,709 --> 02:07:15,677
Yeah? Right after
Zody's, right?

1844
02:07:15,745 --> 02:07:18,077
You were in on that too,
weren't you, Smokey?

1845
02:07:18,147 --> 02:07:22,379
<i>- How 'bout these putos? You know 'em, don't you?
- No. No way.</i>

La Onda? Isn't that what
that snake tattoo means?

1847
02:07:26,255 --> 02:07:28,246
Isn't that what
that snake tattoo means?

1848
02:07:28,324 --> 02:07:30,554
I don't know what the fuck

<i>I'll tell you what
I'm talking about, pendejo.</i>

1850
02:07:32,829 --> 02:07:35,821
You're a two-time loser, Smokey. One
more, they're gonna lock you up for good.

1851
02:07:35,898 --> 02:07:38,628
So you better tell me about Onda, or
I'm gonna strap you down with a bitch.

1852
02:07:38,701 --> 02:07:40,828
You'll never see
the streets again!

1853
02:07:40,903 --> 02:07:45,306
If I say anything, I'm dead meat.
I ain't gonna tell you shit, ese!

<i>It's baby powder, baboso!</i>

1856
02:07:59,755 --> 02:08:01,814
You write down
every word I say.

1857
02:08:01,891 --> 02:08:06,658
Anything you don't understand, you ask.
I will answer just once, so write it down.

1858

Precedents for habeas corpus,
cruel and unusual punishment here.

1859
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:13,034
You're also allowed to help
on Durham decree.

1860
02:08:13,102 --> 02:08:15,263
How much can you
charge for this?

1861
02:08:15,338 --> 02:08:17,863
You gotta know what you're
talkin' about first.

1862
02:08:17,940 --> 02:08:20,374
You do your homework,
jailhouse lawyer...

1863
02:08:20,443 --> 02:08:23,503
can make as much as
any mid-level attorney on the street.

1864
02:08:23,579 --> 02:08:25,706
I'm gonna live

you're in here?

1870
02:08:44,867 --> 02:08:47,927
Eleven tons of Colombian weed,
twelve keys of heroin...

1871
02:08:48,004 --> 02:08:50,802
and a pilot that turned
state's evidence.

1872
02:08:51,841 --> 02:08:55,868
<i>¡Chingao! Big time.</i>

1873
02:08:55,945 --> 02:08:58,607
- Hey, Jer, I just want you to handle my ca...
- Hurry up, Jerry.

1874
02:08:58,681 --> 02:09:01,582
Charlie. I didn't see your jacket here.
You got an appointment?

1875
02:09:01,651 --> 02:09:04,176
<i>The name's Carlos. Remember, I'm
paying you lot of feria, ese.</i>

1876
02:09:04,253 --> 02:09:06,744
- Make an appointment, Charlie.
- You should be working on my case overtime.

1877
02:09:06,822 --> 02:09:10,280
Charlie, cool out or get out.
George? Table.

1878
02:09:12,595 --> 02:09:18,363
<i>Oye, Miklo. You could take your leg off and
hook down some of the books from up top, ese.</i>

1879
02:09:18,434 --> 02:09:23,428
<i>Hey, I'm just kidding, ese.
Come here. Oye, come here, man.</i>

1880
02:09:23,506 --> 02:09:28,136
<i>Hey, relax. I got the medicine
to make you well, vato. Mira.</i>

1881
02:09:28,211 --> 02:09:31,772
<i>If you're ever in any pain, homey, you
just come talk to me. ¿Me entiendes?</i>

1882
02:09:33,916 --> 02:09:35,884
<i>- You should talk to El Mero Mero.
- Chale.</i>

1883
02:09:35,952 --> 02:09:39,444
Think about the future, not the past.
Montana's not God.

1884
02:09:39,689 --> 02:09:43,455
<i>[Carlos] Tomorrow at the council I'm giving
Onda a chance to move into the driver's seat.</i>

1885
02:09:43,525 --> 02:09:45,652
<i>Don't be
left behind, eh?</i>

1886
02:09:45,727 --> 02:09:49,561
<i>Mira. I cut a sweet deal
with the AV-ers.</i>

1887
02:09:49,631 --> 02:09:52,429
<i>They'll supply me
with all the dope I can move...</i>

1888
02:09:52,501 --> 02:09:55,334
just as long as I sell
only to the blacks and the browns.

1889
02:09:56,705 --> 02:10:00,937
What do you have to give
in return to the polar bears?

1890
02:10:02,677 --> 02:10:05,305
I gotta plug up
the B.G.A. Pipeline.

1891
02:10:05,380 --> 02:10:07,314
Take 'em outta
the dope business.

1892
02:10:10,018 --> 02:10:14,478
<i>It's simple. Me and my soldados
can take care of Pockets in here.</i>

1893
02:10:14,556 --> 02:10:18,014
<i>My brother Smokey can take out Cheap
Times, their main supply joint in L.A.</i>

1894
02:10:18,093 --> 02:10:21,119
All I need from the council
is backup.

1895
02:10:21,196 --> 02:10:26,395
- In return, I'm prepared to give Onda a third of my profit.
- It's a sucker's deal, ese.

1896
02:10:28,270 --> 02:10:32,502
The only thing the Aryans want is
to start a war between black and brown.

1897
02:10:32,574 --> 02:10:34,565
<i>Chale. We've got
a truce with the B.G.A.</i>

1898
02:10:34,643 --> 02:10:37,942
<i>Why do you wanna play
the chimp with these mayates?</i>

1899
02:10:38,013 --> 02:10:40,481
The market is there.

1900
02:10:40,549 --> 02:10:43,712
Cocaine is America's
cup of coffee.

1901
02:10:46,154 --> 02:10:48,714
<i>Oye, check it out.</i>

1902
02:10:48,790 --> 02:10:50,724
<i>I'm making so much feria
right now,</i>

1903
02:10:50,792 --> 02:10:53,955
it's making Miklo's gambling book
look like bubble gum change!

1904
02:10:54,029 --> 02:10:57,226
We don't start wars
to become dope pushers.

1905
02:10:57,299 --> 02:10:59,995
<i>You even addicted some of
our own soldados to coca.</i>

1906
02:11:00,068 --> 02:11:04,562
We're supposed to protect
our people, not destroy them.

1907
02:11:04,639 --> 02:11:08,166
Look at his arms. He loves
that shit more than he loves us.

1908
02:11:08,243 --> 02:11:11,804
<i>- He'll destroy La Onda.
- ¡Ya! Enough words.</i>

1909
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:15,976
We've come all this way. You wanna
go back to bumming cigarettes, ese?

1910
02:11:16,051 --> 02:11:19,509
<i>- Oye, you wanna shine shoes?
- Ese, La Onda don't shine shoes.</i>

1911
02:11:19,588 --> 02:11:22,580
That's right, but that's what's gonna
happen if we don't make our move now.

1912
02:11:22,657 --> 02:11:26,218
I wanna own the whole fuckin' store!
Now are you with me?

1913
02:11:26,294 --> 02:11:29,422
<i>I say chale.
You're not the leader here.</i>

1914
02:11:29,498 --> 02:11:31,398
<i>I say Onda's
not with you.</i>

1915
02:11:31,466 --> 02:11:33,559
You do what you
have to do without us.

1916
02:11:43,478 --> 02:11:46,413
'Cause I ain't goin' back.

1917
02:11:48,083 --> 02:11:50,381
I don't need Onda for this.

1918
02:11:50,452 --> 02:11:53,853
Money buys my backup.

1919
02:11:53,922 --> 02:11:56,982
I'll get the polar bears
to back my play.

1920
02:11:59,995 --> 02:12:02,088
<i>- Oye, ¿adonde vas, Jose?
- I split, eh.</i>

1921
02:12:02,163 --> 02:12:04,256
<i>- Hey, carnal.
- No, ese.</i>

1922
02:12:08,236 --> 02:12:12,195
<i>Carlos, come back!
Jefe, we can't let him go.</i>

1923
02:12:12,274 --> 02:12:14,970
We can't let him
split up Onda. Carlos!

1924
02:12:15,043 --> 02:12:18,410
<i>[Jerry] Can't you see Montana's
stupid for letting Charlie walk?</i>

1925
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:20,505
<i>- Onda's committing suicide.
- Fuck you, Jerry!</i>

1926
02:12:20,582 --> 02:12:22,709
Fine. I thought you wanted
to learn something.

1927
02:12:25,921 --> 02:12:27,855
Listen, Charlie's
a businessman.

1928
02:12:27,923 --> 02:12:29,857
He broke some serious
business rules.

1929
02:12:29,925 --> 02:12:32,155
Not only did he get strung out
on his own shit,

1930
02:12:32,227 --> 02:12:34,957
but he moved on B.G.A. Clients
when he didn't have to.

1931
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:36,964
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

1932
02:12:37,032 --> 02:12:39,796
I see the jackets of most
of the cons that come in here.

1933
02:12:39,868 --> 02:12:42,769
Eighty percent of them...
eighty percent of them are drug cases.

1934
02:12:42,837 --> 02:12:45,362
You know why?
Because everybody out there's doin' it.

1935
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:47,499
Doctors, lawyers,
housewives.

1936
02:12:47,576 --> 02:12:50,010
Cocaine is
America's cup of coffee.

1937
02:12:54,316 --> 02:12:56,580
You were Carlos' connection.

1938
02:12:56,651 --> 02:13:01,452
<i>He said the same "cup of coffee"line
exactly. You were supplying him.</i>

1939
02:13:01,523 --> 02:13:04,515
<i>You're pissed 'cause he's
doing business with AV-ers now.</i>

1940
02:13:04,593 --> 02:13:08,051
Last year, California passed
a flat-time law for drug offenders.

1941
02:13:08,129 --> 02:13:10,654
You know what that means? That means
they have it worse than anybody...

1942
02:13:10,732 --> 02:13:12,723
murderers, rapists,
anybody.

1943
02:13:12,801 --> 02:13:15,099
There's no parole,
no good time.

1944
02:13:15,170 --> 02:13:19,300
That's a lot of guys that are gonna be
here for a real long time, all drug users.

1945
02:13:19,374 --> 02:13:21,308
Can you see
the potential?

1946
02:13:21,376 --> 02:13:23,367
- Can you?
- Yeah.

1947
02:13:23,445 --> 02:13:25,504
Anyone who can accommodate
that appetite...

1948
02:13:25,580 --> 02:13:29,038
can control this joint
and every other joint.

1949
02:13:29,117 --> 02:13:31,017
Dwell on it.

1950
02:13:38,293 --> 02:13:41,126
[Lightning] Drive it.
Drive it, Ryder.

1951
02:13:41,196 --> 02:13:43,528
Here's your pill briefs.

1952
02:13:43,598 --> 02:13:47,125
Jerry said it will take at least
three months for the court to respond.

1953
02:13:47,202 --> 02:13:49,727
Well, well, well,
Lightning.

1954
02:13:49,804 --> 02:13:52,864
<i>Our favorite spic lover has come home.
I knew he'd be back.</i>

1955
02:13:52,941 --> 02:13:58,709
Here's your file. Magic said to remind you
about Lightning's account. It's overdue.

1956
02:13:58,780 --> 02:14:03,376
You hear that, Lightning? The cripple
here wants to collect your gambling debts.

1957
02:14:05,120 --> 02:14:08,783
Yeah, well, I might think about it,
if he'll show me his falsie.

1958
02:14:10,125 --> 02:14:11,888
Come on, cripple,
show me your stump.

1959
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:14,394
<i>[Ryder] Little white Mexican boy...</i>

1960
02:14:14,462 --> 02:14:16,487
came all the way back
just to show us his stump.

1961
02:14:16,564 --> 02:14:20,056
- Hold his fuckin' leg! Come on. Stand still.
- Get off me, motherfuckers!

1962
02:14:20,135 --> 02:14:23,036
Too many britches on.
Stay still, goddamn it, I said!

1963
02:14:23,104 --> 02:14:25,334
You gotta be crazy to pull
this shit, Lightning!

1964
02:14:25,407 --> 02:14:27,341
Ooh, I'm scared, punk.

1965
02:14:27,409 --> 02:14:30,242
<i>I'll bet you didn't fight so hard when
Big Al used to do this, did you?</i>

1966
02:14:30,311 --> 02:14:32,176
He must be laughin'
in his grave, cripple.

1967
02:14:32,247 --> 02:14:34,841
Get off, you fuck...
No, leave it alone!

1968
02:14:34,916 --> 02:14:37,749
Stay still,
goddamn it.

1969
02:14:37,819 --> 02:14:42,279
<i>- Oh! There she is.
- Fucking puto!</i>

1970
02:14:42,357 --> 02:14:45,986
You ever heard that old saying,
"Put your foot in your mouth"?

1971
02:14:47,929 --> 02:14:50,591
Spit-shine that shoe, boy.

1972
02:14:52,701 --> 02:14:56,694
- You fuckin' polar bears are gonna pay, believe me!
- [Ryder Spits]

1973
02:14:56,771 --> 02:15:00,366
Look around you, half-breed.
Onda's finished!

1974
02:15:00,442 --> 02:15:02,376
Carlos works for us now,

1975
02:15:02,444 --> 02:15:05,038
and every day he brings
more Onda soldiers with him.

1976
02:15:05,113 --> 02:15:08,310
You greasers better wise up.
It's a white world.

1977
02:15:08,383 --> 02:15:11,045
<i>The coloreds are here
to serve us.</i>

1978
02:15:11,119 --> 02:15:14,885
From now on, you're gonna be
my personal errand boy.

1979
02:15:16,324 --> 02:15:19,316
- You motherfucker!
- Fuckin' punk!

1980
02:15:19,394 --> 02:15:22,886
Go out for a pass, cripple.
Come on, go deep.

1981
02:15:27,736 --> 02:15:29,795
[Laughter]

1982
02:15:31,539 --> 02:15:33,871
Now you're back to
your true nature, boy.

1983
02:15:33,942 --> 02:15:37,639
<i>- Crawling on your belly like a worm.
- [Laughter]</i>

1984
02:15:38,947 --> 02:15:40,881
They put it in my face!

1985
02:15:40,949 --> 02:15:44,851
You have to understand. Your leg is gone,
Miklo. You can no longer be a soldier.

1986
02:15:44,919 --> 02:15:46,853
That's why I put you
in the library.

1987
02:15:46,921 --> 02:15:49,947
It's not what they did to me.
They got no respect for Onda.

1988
02:15:50,024 --> 02:15:52,015
We should never have
given up Carlos.

1989
02:15:52,093 --> 02:15:56,393
You think I wanted to?
Carlos fucked up, bad!

1990
02:15:56,464 --> 02:15:59,331
I'm not saying he didn't,
but he was right about the drugs.

1991
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:01,368
Whoever controls them
controls everything.

1992
02:16:01,436 --> 02:16:04,371
You ever seen an old drug dealer,
Miklo? They don't exist.

1993
02:16:04,439 --> 02:16:06,703
Look, all we have
to do is wait.

1994
02:16:06,774 --> 02:16:10,210
<i>In five years, Chicanos are gonna be the
majority in the pintas in the Southwest.</i>

1995
02:16:10,278 --> 02:16:12,405
This is now,
not five years from now!

1996
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:16,439
What good is it if we're a bunch of fuckin'
slaves workin' for the B.G.A. And AV-ers?

1997
02:16:16,517 --> 02:16:18,542
We gotta attack now!
We gotta take power!

1998
02:16:18,620 --> 02:16:21,316
All we ever been doing is fighting
each other! And for what?

1999
02:16:21,389 --> 02:16:23,380
The best of us ending up
in pools of blood...

2000
02:16:23,458 --> 02:16:25,756
<i>for a pinche pack of smokes
and a snort of coca!</i>

2001
02:16:25,827 --> 02:16:28,227
<i>¡Chale!</i>

2002
02:16:28,296 --> 02:16:31,231
I don't know where
you're comin' from, bro.

2003
02:16:36,604 --> 02:16:38,663
<i>¿Que es eso?</i>

2004
02:16:40,341 --> 02:16:45,540
A Chicana from Cal State got them
to publish my essay on prison reform.

2005
02:16:47,081 --> 02:16:51,040
They want me to write a book
on the Chicano in prison.

2006
02:16:54,656 --> 02:16:57,591
<i>You better lift your eyes
outta this book, Jefe.</i>

2007
02:16:57,659 --> 02:17:00,389
You better see what's
goin' on around us now.

2008
02:17:06,234 --> 02:17:10,694
<i>Wind it up, gentlemen. Take it
to your houses. Let's go, move it.</i>

2009
02:17:10,772 --> 02:17:12,865
<i>[Magic] Hey, Bonafide! When's
the B.G.A. Gonna take care of its tab?</i>

2010
02:17:12,940 --> 02:17:15,101
<i>No can do, carnal.</i>

2011
02:17:17,378 --> 02:17:19,346
Quarter of the bill
I can take care of, maybe.

2012
02:17:19,414 --> 02:17:21,712
<i>Indugu. You forgot
your comb, man.</i>

2013
02:17:23,317 --> 02:17:25,342
Maybe.

2014
02:17:27,088 --> 02:17:29,921
Thinks he's getting away with something.
He's holding on to a fairy tale.

2015
02:17:29,991 --> 02:17:33,085
<i>- ¡Pinche mayate!
- Hey, Magic.</i>

2016
02:17:33,161 --> 02:17:35,129
<i>Help me out.</i>

2017
02:17:35,196 --> 02:17:39,963
<i>[Indistinct Chatter]</i>

2018
02:17:48,242 --> 02:17:50,733
<i>[Inmate] You mad-dog me,
you better watch your back, homes!</i>

2019
02:17:50,812 --> 02:17:54,043
Now the fuckin' AV-ers
won't pay on their bets either.

2020
02:17:54,115 --> 02:17:58,108
Why pay? They were testing us
with Carlos and we folded.

2021
02:17:58,186 --> 02:18:00,211
Now they're gonna take us
apart piece by piece.

2022
02:18:05,259 --> 02:18:08,592

You now have
a combined I.Q. Of two.

02:29:31,679 --> 02:29:33,510
You're a dead man,
Wonder Bread!

2180
02:29:33,581 --> 02:29:36,573
Why don't you kiss my enriched

2183
02:29:41,656 --> 02:29:43,590
Hey, Ryder!
What's goin' on?

2184
02:29:43,658 --> 02:29:47,958
Don't ask me what's goin' on! Ask,
"What are we doin' here? Is there a war?"

2185
02:29:48,029 --> 02:29:51,021
<i>[Ryder] Run 'em outta the goddamn
banks! Save the taxpayers some money!</i>

2186
02:29:51,098 --> 02:29:53,794
All right, gentlemen,
let's clear the yard!

2187
02:29:53,868 --> 02:29:55,893
[Ryder] It's between
the niggers and the spics!

2188
02:29:55,970 --> 02:29:57,961
We're white, white,

<i>[Miklo] Jefe, will Bonafide
listen to me?</i>

2190
02:30:00,775 --> 02:30:02,709
Magic and the others

2191
02:30:02,777 --> 02:30:05,837
If I put one of them in charge,
Bonafide would never trust me.

2192
02:30:05,913 --> 02:30:08,643
You're a jailhouse lawyer,
a counselor.

2193
02:30:08,716 --> 02:30:11,810
- He knows you'll follow my wishes.
- But what if he's lying?

2194
02:30:11,886 --> 02:30:14,354
What if the B.G.A.
Doesn't want peace?

2195
02:30:14,422 --> 02:30:17,653
Nobody in here knows what peace is.
They've never had it.

<i>I'm talking
about power, carnal.</i>

2197
02:30:20,962 --> 02:30:25,023
The only way for us to gain real power

<i>¿Me entiendes?</i>

It's hard to buy it's
that little guy down there.

2201

You better believe it.

2202
02:30:37,845 --> 02:30:40,313
He's got what you
call "charisma."

2203
02:30:40,381 --> 02:30:43,407
You really think he can do something
to stop the violence?

2204
02:30:43,484 --> 02:30:46,885
<i>Montana's got something that makes you
wanna listen to him. He's got a lot of heart.</i>

2205
02:30:46,954 --> 02:30:49,479
If anybody can stop
this war, it's him.

2206
02:30:49,557 --> 02:30:52,993
I can always bring in the guns,
but I'd rather it be him.

2207
02:30:53,060 --> 02:30:55,051
I don't like you
traveling alone.

2208
02:30:55,129 --> 02:30:58,326
I don't trust the administration.
I don't trust anybody.

2209
02:30:58,399 --> 02:31:02,426
Don't worry. The warden's
guaranteeing my passage.

2210
02:31:02,503 --> 02:31:06,496
<i>Top secret route.
Oye.</i>

2211
02:31:07,942 --> 02:31:10,809
I made a deal
with the vato.

2212
02:31:10,878 --> 02:31:15,144
I get to spend the night in Delano,

2213

02:31:23,557 --> 02:31:24,990

<i>[Montana] What time's

2222

Do me some pickin' so I can send my old

<i>- Yeah, I used to pick a little when I was a kid.

[Laughing]

2237
02:33:01,856 --> 02:33:05,690
No, I ain't never picked no grapes.
But I done cut me a bunch.

<i>You know, when I was a kid,
I used to love to pick.</i>

2244

Okay, the escort's on his way.
You'll have one hour with your father.

Bonafide says somebody
counterfeited his comb...

2341
02:40:25,899 --> 02:40:28,129
and put a phony message
in it to hit Montana.

2342
02:40:28,201 --> 02:40:31,170
- The B.G.A. Didn't do it.
- That's bullshit!

2343

Killed him.

2344
02:40:33,240 --> 02:40:36,471
Yeah? Well, the administration doesn't
think so. And what if they're right?

2345

You wanna be responsible for starting a
fucking war against the wrong people? Huh?

2346

Listen, man,
I know you hate me.

2347
02:40:45,252 --> 02:40:48,847
I shot your leg off, and that's something I'm

2348
02:40:48,922 --> 02:40:53,586
But you're still my blood, and I'm not gonna
stand here and watch you destroy yourself.

2349

2357
02:41:24,557 --> 02:41:26,525

Montana was a stand-up dude.
We were set up!

2362

That old man was no jive-ass punk.
He was hard-core B.G.A.

2363

That's right. That's why

I take out Montana with my own man?
That's suicide.

2365
02:42:00,159 --> 02:42:04,858
Now you do what you wanna do,

2490
02:53:14,216 --> 02:53:17,617
<i>- It's about...
- Let's stop fighting, carnal! We're family.</i>

2491
02:53:17,686 --> 02:53:20,621
We should help each other,
not cut each other's throats.

2492
02:53:24,626 --> 02:53:26,821
Let's be brothers again.

2493
02:53:29,231 --> 02:53:31,165
[Sighs]

2494
02:53:33,235 --> 02:53:37,604
Just because you're a cop and I'm a con
doesn't mean we can't cooperate.

2495
02:53:39,741 --> 02:53:43,700
I can give you tips from inside that
could really help you out on the street.

2496
02:53:46,348 --> 02:53:49,283
You got a lot of power
out there, man.

2497
02:53:49,351 --> 02:53:53,185
Your guidance and advice
would be invaluable to me.

2498
02:53:53,255 --> 02:53:57,316
What are you asking me?
To be a member of your gang?

2499
02:53:57,392 --> 02:53:59,860
Are you outta
your fuckin' mind?

2500
02:53:59,928 --> 02:54:04,661
Do you remember how we
took out Spider for Cruz?

2501
02:54:04,733 --> 02:54:07,668
Together, Paco.
We're unbeatable.

2502
02:54:12,140 --> 02:54:16,133
Your Onda's not my onda,
and it never will be.

2503
02:54:18,246 --> 02:54:21,272
Paco!

2504
02:54:24,019 --> 02:54:27,147
I'll always be
your brother, vato loco.

2505
02:54:27,222 --> 02:54:29,315
Never.

2506
02:54:38,934 --> 02:54:41,630
<i>- Orale, Chivito.
- Tucha, carnal. They're watching, homes.</i>

2507
02:54:41,703 --> 02:54:43,728
I know they are.
Let 'em watch.

2508
02:54:43,805 --> 02:54:48,572
<i>[Miklo] The show's just beginning
and they don't even know it.</i>

2509
02:54:48,643 --> 02:54:51,612
<i>This will probably be our last
meeting together, carnales.</i>

2510
02:54:53,548 --> 02:54:58,042
They're trying to break Onda up.
But you know what?

2511
02:54:58,119 --> 02:55:00,849
They're only
helping us grow.

2512
02:55:02,357 --> 02:55:04,382
They're using
the interstate compact...

2513
02:55:04,459 --> 02:55:07,758
<i>to exchange each of you who's from
out of state for cons from Califas.</i>

2514
02:55:09,464 --> 02:55:12,297
So, Chivo, they're
sending you back to Arizona.

2515
02:55:12,367 --> 02:55:15,393
<i>- ¿Como dices?
- Hey, man, we can't do nothin' about it.</i>

2516
02:55:15,470 --> 02:55:18,564
You gotta go. But at least
you'll be back to your mom, man.

2517
02:55:18,640 --> 02:55:21,268
She needs anything, let me know.
I'll take care of her.

2518
02:55:21,343 --> 02:55:24,801
<i>Orale, homes.
Simon que si.</i>

2519
02:55:24,879 --> 02:55:29,248
Geronimo goes back
to Texas.

2520
02:55:29,317 --> 02:55:33,185
<i>- You straighten your son out, ¿que no?
- Simon.</i>

2521
02:55:36,024 --> 02:55:38,049
They're trying
to break up La Onda!

2522
02:55:38,126 --> 02:55:40,060
But we're gonna
turn it on 'em!

2523
02:55:42,264 --> 02:55:44,289
And you know how
we're gonna do that?

2524
02:55:45,967 --> 02:55:49,926
Each of you is gonna establish
your own chapters.

2525
02:55:50,005 --> 02:55:55,170
La Onda has $15,000 for each of you
so you can start things out strong.

2526
02:55:55,243 --> 02:56:00,112
We're gonna spread La Onda
gospel Billy Graham style!

2527
02:56:00,181 --> 02:56:02,240
Yeah.
Say it, homey.

2528
02:56:08,189 --> 02:56:10,214
<i>El Mero Mero
had a dream.</i>

2529
02:56:13,561 --> 02:56:15,722
We are that dream.

2530
02:56:16,965 --> 02:56:20,128
We're gonna multiply
in numbers undreamed of.

2531
02:56:20,201 --> 02:56:22,669
<i>In every pinta,
every barrio.</i>

2532
02:56:22,737 --> 02:56:25,570
Every southwestern state.

2533
02:56:25,640 --> 02:56:27,699
La Onda
has a destiny...

2534
02:56:27,776 --> 02:56:30,244
and no one can stop us.

2535
02:56:34,816 --> 02:56:37,341
<i>¡Eso!</i>

2536
02:56:39,854 --> 02:56:41,913
<i>¡Orale!</i>

2537
02:56:41,990 --> 02:56:44,015
<i>¡Viva La Onda!</i>

2538
02:56:44,092 --> 02:56:46,560
<i>- Tocale, carnal. Orale.
- Viva.</i>

2539
02:56:56,822 --> 02:56:59,222
<i>What about me, carnal?</i>

2540
02:56:59,291 --> 02:57:01,759
Where do I go?

2541
02:57:01,827 --> 02:57:04,955
<i>You stay with me, carnal.</i>

2542
02:57:05,030 --> 02:57:07,430
You're the eyes
behind my back.

2543
02:57:07,499 --> 02:57:09,558
The leg I don't have.

2544
02:57:09,635 --> 02:57:12,035
<i>The other half
of mi corazon.</i>

2545
02:57:25,451 --> 02:57:27,749
You ordered me
to destroy this mold.

2546
02:57:30,122 --> 02:57:35,253
But I kept it for protection...
from you.

2547
02:57:38,731 --> 02:57:41,063
Now I want you
to destroy it.

2548
02:57:59,718 --> 02:58:02,687
- I loved him.
- We both loved him.

2549
02:58:02,755 --> 02:58:06,054
But we did what we
had to do for Onda!

2550
02:58:06,125 --> 02:58:09,094
You were right.

2551
02:58:38,757 --> 02:58:41,123
I give my life to you.

2552
02:58:42,361 --> 02:58:45,057
<i>¡Jefe!</i>

2553
02:58:53,972 --> 02:58:56,031
<i>Simon.</i>

2554
02:59:09,554 --> 02:59:11,920
<i>- [Paco] What are we doing here?
- No Ilores, vato.</i>

2555
02:59:11,990 --> 02:59:15,016
<i>No mas ven.</i>

2556
02:59:15,093 --> 02:59:18,529
- Come on, man.
- Man, you got me outta bed to come down here?

2557
02:59:18,597 --> 02:59:20,758
Think you lost more
than your hair, vato.

2558
02:59:20,832 --> 02:59:24,598
Ha! Don't believe all that
shit you hear about Samson, ese.

2559
02:59:24,669 --> 02:59:27,866
I'm just strippin' myself
down to the bone, homes.

2560
02:59:27,939 --> 02:59:31,102
<i>- What if I said I wouldn't come?
- Shit, I knew you would come.</i>

2561
02:59:32,344 --> 02:59:34,335
<i>Shee... Huacha.</i>

2562
02:59:34,412 --> 02:59:37,040
Come look at yourself
in the mirror, ese.

2563
02:59:40,852 --> 02:59:42,786
Oh, man.

2564
02:59:42,854 --> 02:59:45,379
<i>It's not all
marked up, man.</i>

2565
02:59:45,457 --> 02:59:47,448
<i>It's a sign
of respect.</i>

2566
02:59:47,526 --> 02:59:52,554
For ten years, man, I've been
Star Trekking in the Twilight Zone.

2567
02:59:52,631 --> 02:59:56,465
<i>Thought if I came and looked at this,
I might find my way back, ¿que no?</i>

2568
02:59:58,069 --> 03:00:00,867
<i>[Cruz] Damn!
We were all innocent, eh.</i>

2569
03:00:00,939 --> 03:00:04,898
That's all gone, Cruzito.
It ain't like that anymore.

2570
03:00:04,976 --> 03:00:08,434
<i>What, not even a little carnalismo
left in there, ese?</i>

2571
03:00:08,513 --> 03:00:11,846
What, you think you use brotherhood up
like a shot of tequila?

2572
03:00:11,917 --> 03:00:16,081
<i>[Cruz] You just drink it down,
it burns, makes you feel good, ya?</i>

2573
03:00:16,154 --> 03:00:18,486
<i>And you're left with a hangover
the rest of your life?</i>

2574
03:00:18,557 --> 03:00:20,525
Look, man, you showed me
your mural.

2575
03:00:20,592 --> 03:00:22,685
You're a good artist.
I think you're the best.

2576
03:00:22,761 --> 03:00:24,752
Now come on. Let's go.

2577
03:00:24,829 --> 03:00:28,094
Just 'cause you wear sunglasses
don't mean you're blind, ese.

2578
03:00:28,166 --> 03:00:30,760
Oh, shit! You wanna know
what I see up there?

2579
03:00:30,835 --> 03:00:33,235
A fantasy, man.
A dream.

2580
03:00:33,305 --> 03:00:35,967
Three vatos looking for
something that wasn't there.

2581
03:00:36,041 --> 03:00:40,410
Loco, we stood by each other.
We trusted each other.

2582
03:00:40,478 --> 03:00:42,241
<i>¡Orale! That's
worth believing in!</i>

2583
03:00:42,314 --> 03:00:44,282
<i>Shit, we were familia,
homes.</i>

2584
03:00:44,349 --> 03:00:48,843
And never again, Cruzito.
Miklo and I are finished, man.

2585
03:00:48,920 --> 03:00:52,219
<i>He ain't my family!
I hate that fuckin' puto!</i>

2586
03:00:52,290 --> 03:00:54,781
You oughta scrape his ass
off the wall like dirt.

2587
03:00:54,859 --> 03:00:59,319
<i>Chale, vato. No matter how much hate there is
between you and him, you're still connected.</i>

2588
03:00:59,397 --> 03:01:02,457
You got the same blood pumping
through both your hearts, ese.

2589
03:01:02,534 --> 03:01:04,729
That's a bond
you can never break.

2590
03:01:04,803 --> 03:01:07,601
Neither can Miklo.

2591
03:01:07,672 --> 03:01:09,572
He's still just trying
to be like you!

2592
03:01:09,641 --> 03:01:12,166
<i>- That's bullshit!
- ¡Simon, ese! Come on!</i>

2593
03:01:12,244 --> 03:01:15,145
<i>¡El Gallo Negro!
The baddest Chicano in the barrio!</i>

2594
03:01:15,213 --> 03:01:18,205
Yeah, well, that ain't me!
Not anymore.

2595
03:01:20,885 --> 03:01:22,819
You ain't changed
a bit, ese.

2596
03:01:24,222 --> 03:01:26,190
Oh, so what?
What are you saying?

2597
03:01:26,258 --> 03:01:28,522
It's all my fault the way
everything turned out?

2598
03:01:40,739 --> 03:01:42,730
Oh, I see.

2599
03:01:49,748 --> 03:01:51,841
<i>Orale.</i>

2600
03:01:51,916 --> 03:01:54,817
What, you think you got
so much fucking power, huh?

2601
03:01:58,089 --> 03:02:01,354
<i>You control everybody's
destiny? Chale.</i>

2602
03:02:04,262 --> 03:02:07,322
- No, you're right, man. I set Miklo up.
- No, I'm not.

2603
03:02:07,399 --> 03:02:10,800
I made him go after Spider.
I started the whole fuckin' thing.

2604
03:02:10,869 --> 03:02:13,497
Relax, ese.

2605
03:02:13,571 --> 03:02:16,438
- Your back wouldn't be all fucked up.
- [Sighs]

2606
03:02:16,508 --> 03:02:20,205
- Miklo wouldn't be in prison. He'd still have his leg.
- Hey, I forgive you, ese.

2607
03:02:20,278 --> 03:02:22,644
I don't want
your forgiveness, man!

2608
03:02:24,683 --> 03:02:28,983
You know, that's your fuckin' problem,
ese. You can't forgive yourself.

2609
03:02:31,856 --> 03:02:34,620
You need that guilt.
It's what keeps you going.

2610
03:02:34,693 --> 03:02:38,959
Hey, I know, bro. I fed mine
through a needle for ten years.

2611
03:02:42,400 --> 03:02:45,801
<i>And that guero up there, hating
his own fuckin' white skin?</i>

2612
03:02:45,870 --> 03:02:48,532
Shit, he's got it worse
than both of us.

2613
03:02:51,242 --> 03:02:55,804
<i>You gotta cut it loose, carnal.
It's fucking poison!</i>

2614
03:02:57,415 --> 03:02:59,542
That's who we are.

2615
03:02:59,617 --> 03:03:03,485
<i>Three vatos locos
full of carnalismo,</i>

2616
03:03:03,555 --> 03:03:06,422
trying to survive
in a fuckin' war zone.

2617
03:03:06,491 --> 03:03:12,157
<i>But what I know now, bro, is that I need
my familia to do it. We all do.</i>

2618
03:03:14,632 --> 03:03:18,363
<i>Even you, ¡pinche jura!
Badass cop.</i>

2619
03:03:18,436 --> 03:03:20,961
Hey, don't back away,
vato.

2620
03:03:21,039 --> 03:03:24,440
<i>Life's a risk, carnal.
Remember? You said it yourself.</i>

2621
03:03:24,509 --> 03:03:27,876
<i>¡Pues orale!
Step into the ring and throw down, ese.</i>

2622
03:03:27,946 --> 03:03:31,541
You a badass?
Take care of business, homes.

2623
03:03:31,616 --> 03:03:33,914
<i>¡Caiga, puto!</i>

2624
03:03:33,985 --> 03:03:36,886
'Cause we're
from East Los, ese!

2625
03:03:38,056 --> 03:03:41,492
We come out chased
by hounds! Huh?

2626
03:03:43,728 --> 03:03:48,495
<i>Round and round we go,
wearing a pinche rabbit's foot for luck.</i>

2627
03:03:48,566 --> 03:03:50,659
<i>Just ahead of the fuckin'
hounds. ¡Qu'iubo!</i>

2628
03:03:50,735 --> 03:03:53,169
- Ow!
- Yeah!

2629
03:03:53,238 --> 03:03:57,265
<i>¡Que vida es!
Que loca vida, homes.</i>

2630
03:04:02,180 --> 03:04:04,842
<i>¿Pero sabes que, ese?</i>

2631
03:04:04,916 --> 03:04:08,010
<i>- [Sniffling]
- Hey.</i>

2632
03:04:08,086 --> 03:04:12,682
We got something better
than a rabbit's foot, homes.

2633
03:04:12,757 --> 03:04:15,555
<i>We've got familia!</i>

2634
03:04:17,962 --> 03:04:20,021
<i>Raza, huey.</i>

2635
03:04:29,240 --> 03:04:32,698
Hmm? You know
what I'm saying, ese?

2636
03:04:32,777 --> 03:04:34,870
<i>Crees mucho,
Gallo Negro.</i>

2637
03:04:34,946 --> 03:04:37,972
You may be bad, but you
can't dance like Smooth Cruz.

2638
03:04:38,049 --> 03:04:39,949
<i>¡Orale!
Yo y tu, ese.</i>

2639
03:04:40,018 --> 03:04:43,681
Oh, I see now.
I remember you, vato.

2640
03:04:43,755 --> 03:04:45,814
<i>- ¡Ah! ¡Ay, ay, ay!
- El Gallo Negro, vato.</i>

2641
03:04:45,890 --> 03:04:48,688
<i>- I'm a lover, not a fighter, man.
- Oh, si.</i>

2642
03:04:48,760 --> 03:04:51,854
<i>Simon. El merengue
at the Tender Trap '72.</i>

2643
03:04:51,930 --> 03:04:55,593
<i>- Rucas got their hearts broke and I kicked your ass. Pow! Pow!
- Shit!</i>

2644
03:04:55,667 --> 03:04:57,567
Shit, man, I was breakin'
hearts and faces, vato.

2645
03:04:57,635 --> 03:05:01,799
<i>[Cruz] ¡Oh, si! Bullshit!
You still can't dance, ese!</i>

2646
