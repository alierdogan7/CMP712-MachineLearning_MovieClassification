1
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,042
What'd you think,
you paired up with him?

2
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,812
What I think?

3
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:30,056
Well, you don't pick your parents,
and you don't pick your partner.

4
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:35,197
You know, they used to call him
"The Tax Man" for a while?

5
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:39,904
He come out of Texas, so nobody knew him.

6
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,066
Seemed a bit raw-boned to me. Edgy.

7
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,246
Took three months till we got him
over to the house for dinner.

8
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,679
Around our big 419.

9
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,185
That's what y'all want
to hear about, right?

10
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,950
Dora Lange. The kids in the woods.

11
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,353
Yeah, sure.

12
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:03,155
But, uh, talk about Cohle.
We heard some stories.

13
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,321
Kind of a strange guy, huh?

14
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,757
"Strange." Uh...

15
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:11,762
Yeah.

16
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:18,372
Rust would pick a fight with the sky,
he didn't like its shade of blue.

17
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,182
But when we finally
got him over to the house,

18
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,308
this is when that case was hot,

19
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:30,320
poor bastard looked like
he was on his way to the firing squad.

20
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,658
Dora Lange.

21
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,994
The "Occult Ritual Murder."

22
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,697
You can thank The Advertiser for that.

23
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,766
Could you hold off on that?

24
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,233
Yeah, you can't
do that here no more.

25
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,735
- Huh?
Uh-uh.

26
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:51,034
Don't be assholes.
You want to hear this or not?

27
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:14,966
Vermilion Sheriff requested assistance
with a 419, cane fields outside of Erath.

28
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,763
I'd been on the job
about three months till then.

29
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,499
Two previous cases were open and shut.

30
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,675
On January the 3rd, 1995,
my daughter's birthday,

31
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,413
I remember.

32
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,405
Hart and Cohle, State CID.

33
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,441
Who found her?

34
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,071
A farmer and his son.

35
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,377
This spread wasn't scheduled for a burn.

36
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,612
Let's keep them here,
and let's tape off this road,

37
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,746
and give me your log.

38
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:35,846
Go ahead.

39
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,707
- You ever see something like this?
- No, Sheriff.

40
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,542
Eight years, CID.

41
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,409
Them symbols, it's Satanic.

42
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,845
They had a 20/20 on it a few years back.

43
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,113
- ID?
- No, sir.

44
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:20,453
We're gonna need
more men for a grid search.

45
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:25,128
Set up a perimeter wide as possible
on those three roads.

46
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:28,598
Post up, take license plates
of anything that passes.

47
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:30,957
I-23.

48
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,004
Go ahead, I-23.

49
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:38,071
We're gonna need
investigator assist on that 419,

50
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,837
all you can spare for a canvass.

51
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,343
Roger that, Detective.

52
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:45,045
Okay. Tell me what you see.

53
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,483
Ligature marks on her wrists,
ankles and knees.

54
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:54,921
Multiple shallow stab wounds
to the abdomen.

55
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,858
Hemorrhaging around throat.

56
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,989
Lividity at the shoulders,
thighs' and torso.

57
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,998
She'd been on her back awhile

58
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,336
before he moved her.

59
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,781
That's why they called him
"The Tax Man."

60
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:21,216
The rest of us had
these little note pads or something.

61
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,777
He had this big ledger.

62
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:28,053
Looked funny walking door to door with it
like the tax man,

63
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,695
which ain't bad, as far as nicknames go.

64
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,563
Yeah. Of course,
I've always taken a lot of notes.

65
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,699
I mean, you never know
what the thing's gonna be, do you?

66
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,140
That little detail, somewhere
way down the line, makes you say, "Oh!"

67
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,003
Breaks the case.

68
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,279
You know, I've seen all
the different types.

69
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,715
We all fit a certain category.

70
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,447
The bully.

71
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,821
The charmer.

72
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:02,223
The, uh, surrogate dad.

73
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:06,196
The man possessed by ungovernable rage.

74
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,061
The brain.

75
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:13,799
And any of those types
could be a good detective,

76
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:17,397
and any of those types could be
an incompetent shit-heel.

77
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,440
Which type were you?

78
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,072
Oh, I was just

79
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,274
a regular-type dude

80
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,181
with a big-ass dick.

81
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:34,292
A lot of it had to do
with how they manage authority.

82
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:41,498
There can be a burden
in authority, in vigilance.

83
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,595
Like a father's burden.

84
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,567
It's too much for some men.

85
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:52,042
A smart guy who's steady is hard to find.

86
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,874
I was all right. Better than some.

87
00:08:55,969 --> 00:09:00,884
But I knew how to talk to people,
and I was steady.

88
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,545
Rust,

89
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:09,218
now his Texas files were classified,
or redacted.

90
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:14,254
And he wasn't big on talking
except when you wanted him to shut up.

91
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,496
But he was smart.

92
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:27,037
Yeah. Second week we were together,
I saw where he was living.

93
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,612
Kind of made me feel for the guy.

94
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,156
I'd offer you a seat' but, uh...

95
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,834
Don't mention it. I, uh... I cant stay.

96
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,131
Yeah, I'll tell you
guys, and believe me,

97
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:03,180
past a certain age,
a man without a family can be a bad thing.

98
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,805
We'd encountered a meta-psychotic.

99
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:42,216
Which I had to explain to Marty
what meta-psychotic was.

100
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,227
This is gonna happen again.

101
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,263
Or it's happened before.

102
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,591
Both.

103
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,394
Go on.

104
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,564
It's fantasy enactment. Ritual.

105
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,940
Fetishization, iconography.

106
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,645
This is his vision.
Her body is a paraphilic love map.

107
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,008
How's that?

108
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:19,284
An attachment of physical lust to fantasies
and practices forbidden by society.

109
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,851
You get that from one of your books?

110
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,295
I did.

111
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:31,967
Her knees are abraded,
rug burns on her back.

112
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:35,029
Cold sores, gum line recession, bad teeth.

113
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,802
There's decent odds she was a prost.

114
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,834
He might not have known her,

115
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,575
but this idea goes way back with him.

116
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:52,349
You got a chapter in one of those books
on jumping to conclusions?

117
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,523
You attach an assumption
to a piece of evidence,

118
00:11:56,616 --> 00:12:00,325
you start to bend the
narrative to support it.

119
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,960
Prejudice yourself.

120
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,639
Wait and see on the ID.

121
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,367
All right.

122
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,471
This kind of thing
does not happen in a vacuum.

123
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,283
I guarantee this wasn't his first.

124
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,015
It's too specific.

125
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,089
Uh...

126
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,200
Listen, uh... Ahem, this is

127
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:46,333
a stupid time to mention this,

128
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,842
but you got to come to dinner.

129
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:55,610
Can't put Maggie off anymore,
so you just got to.

130
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,661
All right.

131
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,371
- Gordon, thanks for coming.
- Marty.

132
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,937
Anyway, that evening,
it wasn't even sundown,

133
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,469
he decided it was a good time
to invite me over for dinner,

134
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,480
which I got a problem with.

135
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,518
All right, 'cause I'm thinking
about Marty's wife and his two kids

136
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,612
and how it's my daughter's birthday,

137
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,157
and I know...

138
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,726
There's nothing I can do about it.

139
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:40,560
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,

140
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,399
but I'm gonna have a drink.

141
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,003
- Let me get up!
- Daddy!

142
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:51,766
You're gonna meet him.
I got to get the door.

143
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,075
Hey.

144
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:18,493
People out here, it's like they
don't even know the outside world exists.

145
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,707
Might as well be living
on the fucking moon.

146
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:28,045
There's all kinds of ghettos in the world.

147
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,472
It's all one ghetto, man.

148
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,314
A giant gutter in outer space.

149
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,647
Today, that scene,

150
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,663
that is the most fucked
up thing I ever caught.

151
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,995
Ask you something?

152
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,493
You're a Christian, yeah?

153
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,431
No.

154
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:01,638
Well, then what do you got the cross for
in your apartment?

155
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,641
That's a form of meditation.

156
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,207
How's that?

157
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,718
I contemplate the moment in the garden,

158
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:18,861
the idea of allowing your own crucifixion.

159
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,034
But you're not a Christian.
So what do you believe?

160
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:30,706
I believe that people shouldn't talk
about this type of shit at work.

161
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,368
Hold on, hold on.

162
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:38,272
Three months we been together,
I get nothing from you.

163
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,682
Today, what we're into now.

164
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:45,748
Do me a courtesy, okay?
I'm not trying to convert you.

165
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,051
Look, I'd consider myself
a realist, all right,

166
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,789
but in philosophical terms,
I'm what's called a pessimist.

167
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,388
Um, okay. What's that mean?

168
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,592
It means I'm bad at parties.

169
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:01,900
Let me tell you,
you ain't great outside of parties either.

170
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:13,080
I think human consciousness
is a tragic misstep in evolution.

171
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,676
We became too self-aware.

172
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,748
Nature created an aspect of nature
separate from itself.

173
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:23,453
We are creatures that should not exist
by natural law.

174
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,960
Huh. That sounds god-fucking-awful, Rust.

175
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:31,502
We are things that labor under the illusion
of having a self,

176
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:35,562
this accretion of sensory experience
and feeling,

177
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:40,807
programmed with total assurance
that we are each somebody

178
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,872
when, in fact, everybody's nobody.

179
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,314
I wouldn't go around
spouting that shit if I was you.

180
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:50,182
People around here don't think that way.
I don't think that way.

181
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,883
I think the honorable thing
for our species to do

182
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,947
is deny our programming.

183
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,722
Stop reproducing.

184
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:01,395
Walk hand in hand into extinction.

185
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,761
One last midnight.

186
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,597
Brothers and sisters
opting out of a raw deal.

187
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:12,401
So what's the point
in getting out of bed in the morning?

188
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,445
I tell myself I bear witness,

189
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,641
but the real answer is
that it's obviously my programming.

190
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,975
And I lack the constitution for suicide.

191
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:26,654
My luck, I picked today to get to know you.

192
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,685
Three months I don't hear a word from you,
and...

193
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:30,887
- You asked.
- Yeah.

194
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,692
And now I'm begging you
to shut the fuck up.

195
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,936
I get a bad taste in my mouth out here.

196
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,004
Aluminum, ash.

197
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,278
Like you can smell the psychosphere.

198
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,645
I got an idea.

199
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:58,552
Let's make the car
a place of silent reflection from now on.

200
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:00,816
Okay?

201
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,832
What should I bring for dinner?

202
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,571
A bottle of wine would be nice, I guess.

203
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:22,738
I don't drink.

204
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,009
Oh, no, of course not, Rust.

205
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:30,452
Listen. When you're at my house,
I want you to chill the fuck out.

206
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:33,456
Don't even mention any of that bullshit
you just said to me.

207
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,957
Of course not, Marty.

208
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,527
I'm not some kind of maniac, all right?

209
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,528
I mean, for fuck's sake.

210
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,280
- DEMMA; What did you hear?
- Ask Cohle.

211
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:00,874
You mean The Tax Man?

212
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,714
You know he's IA.

213
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,356
This is State CID Homicide
Detective Geraci.

214
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,253
Yes, ma'am.
I'm calling to ask about that night...

215
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,598
I mean, you never heard
any shit like this before.

216
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,065
She had

217
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,894
antlers.

218
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,427
Um...

219
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,506
- Fuck.
- This is...

220
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:26,941
This is a real thing.
It's some Halloween shit.

221
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:34,042
Well, we're gonna have to do
a press conference.

222
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,610
What about him? What do you think?

223
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:44,457
Smart.

224
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:46,957
Aloof.

225
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,723
Doesn't care about making friends,

226
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,497
but he's already running with it.

227
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,437
He's got a real mind for it.

228
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:58,369
Yeah.

229
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,468
So you'd keep him on it?

230
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,212
Both of us, yeah' I would.

231
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,811
All right. You're still lead.

232
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:13,814
The incident room is yours.

233
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:17,224
- And, uh, you do the briefing tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

234
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,659
Thank you.

235
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,501
Hello, sir.

236
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,042
Fuck that prick.

237
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,735
All I'm saying is
it doesn't make any sense

238
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,000
- for her to be dumped in a cane field.
- Hello?

239
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,742
Apparently, she had
all kinds of weird markings.

240
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:38,872
Yeah. No. I
couldn't hear you there.

241
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,882
Antlers, and shit
there was burned out.

242
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,816
That's my point.
They wanted you to see her.

243
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,183
Yeah. You don't mark up a body like that...

244
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,917
She had antlers? What does that mean?

245
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,616
It was a crown.

246
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:53,755
We'll do the briefing tomorrow, guys.
Early.

247
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:56,527
My guy does the AP Wire
asked about Satanism.

248
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,934
It got Speece here.
You're gonna have his nose up your ass.

249
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,563
Major was saying something
about a press conference.

250
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,370
Well, guess loan count
my blessings, fellas.

251
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,001
Thanks for that.

252
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,082
Hey, you mind if I skate? Ahem.

253
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,560
I got some names from Vice, prost farms.

254
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,097
Check around on our DB.

255
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,133
You want me to go with you?

256
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:34,501
Nah. Just something to do.

257
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:40,372
Yeah. You go ahead.
I'll take care of the paperwork.

258
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:49,047
Like I said, I'm feeling a
lot of stuff hit me at this time.

259
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:53,624
My daughter's birthday, this dead woman,
and, um,

260
00:21:56,248 --> 00:22:01,527
figured I'd work the case, you know,
till DiCillo called or we got an ID.

261
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:07,027
State Vice gave me some addresses
to follow up on.

262
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:10,938
So far, nobody had talked to me.

263
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,860
Come on!

264
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,069
Evening, ladies.

265
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,877
I was hoping to ask y'all a few questions.

266
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,715
Oh, come on, man.

267
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,377
I'll get the next round.

268
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:58,149
You making trouble for us, sir?

269
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:02,482
No. I'm just looking to get
some information on a woman.

270
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,720
Might be you know her.

271
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,659
- Who's that?
- Hold on.

272
00:23:07,653 --> 00:23:08,654
Mmm.

273
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:12,100
We'll lake two large
Long Island Iced Teas, please.

274
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:15,901
Ma'am.

275
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,772
I'm Rust, by the way.

276
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,179
I'm Anette. She's Lucy.

277
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:05,253
Either one of you
know a woman about your age?

278
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:06,847
Works the same place.

279
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:11,085
About 5'5". Blond, like you.

280
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,526
What kind of tits she have?

281
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:21,398
Medium, a little larger than yours,
proportion to the body, natural.

282
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:22,733
Hmm.

283
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:26,436
Gee. I don't know.
We see a lot of girls like that around.

284
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:30,805
Any girls like that
you haven't seen around lately?

285
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,473
Missing, like?

286
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,312
People come and go.

287
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,886
What do you want them for?

288
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:44,026
I wouldn't bust somebody for hooking
or drugs.

289
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,094
I'm murder police.

290
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,964
Somebody got killed.

291
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,805
There's a girl named Liza,
another called Destiny,

292
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,841
but I seen Destiny yesterday at McDonald's.

293
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,672
- What about Liza?
- She's here.

294
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:16,216
Anette, go get a couple more drinks
from the bar, will you, please?

295
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:20,127
All right.

296
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,562
You get pills pretty easy?

297
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,435
Relax. I want some.

298
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,071
Speed?

299
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,708
No, Quaaludes. Anything barbital.

300
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:44,913
Uppers are easier to get,
and they last longer, too.

301
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,456
Yeah, but it's not like that.

302
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:49,049
What's ii like?

303
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:51,585
I don't sleep.

304
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,296
Hey.

305
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,921
Oh.

306
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,762
Hey, Lone Ranger.

307
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:31,960
Hey.

308
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:33,892
Ugh.

309
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,800
Dreaming.

310
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,134
Why you out here, huh?

311
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,667
Why didn't you come to bed?

312
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,171
Um...

313
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:50,986
Caught a bad one yesterday.

314
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,954
Just couldn't sleep.

315
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,824
You got that woman from Erath?

316
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:58,293
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

317
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,159
Saw it on the news.

318
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:05,899
Girls will be up soon.

319
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,800
Missed you the last couple days.

320
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:13,736
Oh, shit. I got to shower.

321
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,039
Got a debriefing today
and maybe a press conference later.

322
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:28,718
And if Speece calls, tell him
I'm debriefing the squad all morning.

323
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,020
Well, Marty
said he was doing that.

324
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:31,082
He is.

325
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,595
Hey, beautiful.

326
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:34,888
Morning, baby.

327
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,557
Marty,
how you want your coffee, doll'?

328
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,095
Strong and black, just like you.

329
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:42,364
Prints came back. Dora Kelly Lange.

330
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:47,740
Priors for shoplifting, possession
and solicitation.

331
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,403
Address outside of St. Maninville.

332
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:52,175
Landlord says she hasn't lived there
in almost a year.

333
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,307
She's got an ex, Charlie Lange,

334
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:55,850
who's doing eight in Avoyelles
for bad checks.

335
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:59,481
Mom's outside of Breaux Bridge.
DMV license expired.

336
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:01,286
And DiCillo called.

337
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,788
She was washed clean,
not a print on her.

338
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:11,197
We got ligature marks
on the wrists and ankles.

339
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,931
She was bound by a half-inch rope,
maybe 10, 20 hours.

340
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,564
Evidence of vaginal intercourse.

341
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,878
Bound upright.
Hadn't eaten in a day, maybe more.

342
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:25,875
Toxicology hit for lysergic acid
and methamphetamine.

343
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:28,212
Crystal and LSD.

344
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,053
How much LSD?

345
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,919
Hard to say. Got to wait for a mass spec.

346
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:38,093
So she was drugged, bound,

347
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,888
tortured with a knife, strangled,

348
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,396
posed out there.

349
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:47,599
Yeah.

350
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:52,169
What about this stuff?

351
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,075
Well, the crown,
for lack of a better word,

352
00:28:56,001 --> 00:29:00,074
rose thorns, early cane, switchgrass

353
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,046
Wrapped around a bent branch.

354
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:07,422
And the horns are deer antlers.

355
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,720
Again, no prints on anything.

356
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:12,659
The symbols are painted
with acrylic, basic blue,

357
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:14,163
using a thick glove finger.

358
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,455
Ideas what any of this means?

359
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,000
I don't know.

360
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:22,029
And it's all primitive.
It's like cave paintings.

361
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,368
Maybe you ought to talk
to an anthropologist.

362
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,648
All the trouble this guy went to.

363
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,522
Seems real personal.

364
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,256
I don't think so.

365
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,195
It was iconic, planned.

366
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,695
And in some ways, it was impersonal.

367
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:54,601
Think of the blindfold.

368
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:03,639
This place is like somebody's memory
of the town, and the memory's fading.

369
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,841
It's like there was
never anything here but jungle.

370
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,946
Stop saying shit like that.
It's unprofessional.

371
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,722
Is that what I'm going for here?

372
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:19,923
I just want you to stop saying odd shit,
like you smell a psycho's fear,

373
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,261
or you're in someone's
faded memory of a town.

374
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,527
Just stop.

375
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,899
Well, given how long it's taken for me
to reconcile my nature,

376
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,768
I can't figure I'd forgo it
on your account, Marty.

377
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,077
Ahem.

378
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:49,116
You get any sleep last night?

379
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,056
I don't sleep.

380
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,651
I just dream.

381
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:55,921
"Occult."

382
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,761
Now, I don't know
if this shit is anything but crazy,

383
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:03,204
but Speece and the Superintendent,
they're paying attention.

384
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:05,172
The newspapers are making hay.

385
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,667
Church groups.

386
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,812
Detective?

387
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,211
Ahem.

388
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,374
All right, here's what we got so far.

389
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,908
Deceased's name is Dora Kelly Lange, 28.

390
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,284
You stay busy now, the business?

391
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:24,091
Well, yeah, I got the security firm,
PI stuff. Routine.

392
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,989
A lot of guys that leave their job,
cemetery within 10.

393
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,932
No family, idle hands.

394
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,805
Some advice. You make
it out, you stay busy.

395
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:41,008
Hit the corners.
Ask about anybody she was seeing.

396
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:46,015
Regular customers, meth dealers,
rough johns, anything.

397
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:49,611
Any questions?

398
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,780
You believe in ghosts?

399
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:24,513
What'd we say about silent reﬂection?

400
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,831
You happen to hear anything
out of the ordinary

401
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:39,961
between 10:00 and 1:00 a.m. out back?

402
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:45,573
No, no, but, uh, sometimes
they dove hunt out there.

403
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,741
They found a woman?

404
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:51,045
Is it the Fontenot girl?

405
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,216
- Who?
- And why would you ask that?

406
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,410
I don't know.

407
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,185
Went missing around here years back.

408
00:32:58,243 --> 00:32:59,916
Last time something happened.

409
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,416
Just thought maybe it's her.

410
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,085
How old was she, this girl?

411
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,594
I don't know. Little.

412
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,996
You know where the family lives?

413
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:23,203
They had a place a couple of streets down.

414
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:26,877
They moved after.

415
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,560
Do you know the Fontenot girl,
the one went missing?

416
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:31,883
Her?

417
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:37,555
Her family come to our service once
or Mice, five or six years back.

418
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,496
Is that the girl? Oh, Lord.

419
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,694
No, sir, it's not.

420
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:45,596
Excuse me.

421
00:33:46,801 --> 00:33:48,402
I want to ask y'all something.

422
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,633
Y'all think maybe this have
something to do with those cats?

423
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:53,209
- What cats?
- Two of them.

424
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,745
One, and a couple of weeks later another.

425
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,040
Somebody cut them up,

426
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:00,707
turned the insides out,
then nailed them to the front door, twice.

427
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:03,382
Now, I called and told the police,

428
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:06,217
but we're predominantly
an African American congregation.

429
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,956
I asked for it to be investigated.

430
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,585
We aren't those type of police' sir.

431
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,328
Well, who is, then?

432
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,331
Can I ask you something?

433
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:28,811
Any of these look familiar to you?
Seen them anywhere?

434
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:30,675
No. No, they

435
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:33,807
look like something that might be
carved into a tree or something.

436
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,852
Mmm-hmm. How about these?

437
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:40,889
Now, that look like something my old auntie
taught us how to make when I was a tyke.

438
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,091
What are they?

439
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:45,890
Some folks call them bird traps.

440
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:48,591
Old auntie told us that
they were devil nets.

441
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:51,725
You put them around the bed,
catch the devil before he get too close.

442
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,898
- That's interesting.
- Hmm.

443
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,996
She was a wonderful woman.

444
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,204
Loved her some Jesus,

445
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,370
but had a bit of that Santeria in her,
you know.

446
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,676
I always just thought it was something
for children to do.

447
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,113
Keep them busy.

448
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:10,186
Tell them stories
why they're tying sticks together.

449
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,314
Then that's all we got
on the Fontenot girl.

450
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:15,773
There was nothing in there.

451
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:18,226
Says, "Possible report made in error."

452
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,591
Now, that was five years ago.

453
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,891
Ted Childress was sheriff back then.

454
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,365
He's setup in, uh, Gulf
Shores now, I think.

455
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:27,096
10-year-old girl goes missing,
that doesn't go statewide?

456
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:30,731
Now, hold on now. My understanding, the
little girl went off with her birth daddy.

457
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:35,039
Now, did you check her mom's record?
Possession, solicitation.

458
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,340
I believe Ted knew the family,

459
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:40,002
and the feeling was the little girl
was better off with her daddy.

460
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:41,985
Mom seemed to agree.

461
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,486
She filed a complaint,
then never bothered with it again.

462
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:45,816
Took off with her boyfriend.

463
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:50,682
R&I said you had a complaint these parts
around December.

464
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:53,093
Little girl getting
chased through the woods.

465
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,654
Oh, yeah, I pulled that one for you, too.

466
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:05,999
What the hell is this?

467
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:09,671
Little girl said a green-eared spaghetti
monster chased her through some woods.

468
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:13,614
Now, we had her work with a sketch artist,

469
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,674
and she told us that looked exactly right.

470
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:19,415
Now, you want to call in an APB on that,
you go right ahead.

471
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,225
Listen, boys. I'm gonna have to call
a little timeout, make a beer run.

472
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,785
Well, why don't you hold off
on that for a while?

473
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,865
All right, well,
why don't you get it, then?

474
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,696
We really don't want to do that.

475
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,933
Well, is this supposed to be admissible?
Huh?

476
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:41,277
You wanna pick my brain?

477
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:45,643
You work a room, you buy a man
a cheeseburger and a Coke, don't you?

478
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:51,246
I'll take a sixer.
Old Milwaukee or Lone Star, nothing snooty.

479
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,880
Why is this so important
to you all of a sudden?

480
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,892
'Cause ifs Thursday and it's past noon.

481
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:00,319
Thursday is one of my days off.

482
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,264
On my off days, I start drinking at noon.

483
00:37:04,122 --> 00:37:06,602
You don't get to interrupt that.

484
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,476
Ahem.

485
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,821
- I'd appreciate a little hustle
up on that. -

486
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:32,095
Yesterday,
at approximately 6 a.m...

487
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:38,566
civilians came across the body of a female
in a sugar cane field outside of Erath.

488
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:42,630
Now, this person, we believe, was murdered,

489
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,604
and we are not yet in a position to

490
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:49,577
Release the identity of the victim
or to offer details of the crime.

491
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:52,843
Our investigators

492
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:58,211
have several leads, and hopefully will
have a suspect for you in custody soon.

493
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:05,223
Now, this perpetrator will be apprehended,
and he will know swift Louisiana justice.

494
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,456
- Any Satanic signs?
- How old was she?

495
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,157
- Charie?
- Mmm-hmm?

496
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:11,200
Let's talk about your ex, Dora Lange.

497
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,528
You want to talk Dori?

498
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,298
What's she said I've done now?

499
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:19,967
Nothing. We're just curious
if you knew what she's been up to,

500
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,271
maybe where she's living?

501
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,400
Nope.

502
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:27,109
Got the divorce papers pushed through
after I'd been here about a year.

503
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:28,979
I don't blame the bitch.

504
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,382
She got a habit?

505
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,854
Yeah, a few.

506
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:37,950
Weed, meth, juice. Name it.

507
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,290
Charlie, how'd y'all meet?

508
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,923
Growed up together,
dropped out the same time.

509
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,899
Hitched up way too quick.

510
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,935
You know how it is,
you want a wife, but only half the time.

511
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:51,698
Hmm.

512
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:54,744
Why are you saying
you hadn't heard from her?

513
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,143
She called up here for
you not too long ago.

514
00:38:57,936 --> 00:39:01,110
She couldn't help me anyway, man.
She sounded fucked up.

515
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:03,015
You see, that's exactly the kind of thing

516
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,281
that we do want to know about
though, Charlie.

517
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:06,753
Oh. All right.

518
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,914
Uh... I needed some scratch for my store,

519
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:13,120
and Dori owes me money,
she ain't got no fucking phone,

520
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,495
so got a number to her friend Carla,
got her to call me back,

521
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,591
and she ain't made no fucking sense.

522
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,996
Ahem. Carla's full name and phone number.

523
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,998
What you mean,
she didn't make sense?

524
00:39:25,964 --> 00:39:28,137
Like she could duck hunt with a rake.

525
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:30,611
High, yeah.

526
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:34,209
Talking about she's gonna become a nun.

527
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:37,384
- Why a nun?
- I don't know, man. She was high.

528
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:39,012
Fucked up.

529
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,750
Uh, talking about she met a king.

530
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,892
Yeah.

531
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:49,125
Anyway, I don't need no snitch jacket
up in here.

532
00:39:49,254 --> 00:39:51,791
Give me a break.

533
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:56,367
This is Avoyelles. It's a goddamn day camp.

534
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,066
Spend sometime in Angola.

535
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:02,209
Surprised you even got Aryan Nation here.

536
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:06,380
What'd Dori do?

537
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,845
Dori's dead.

538
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:17,249
Thank you, boys.
We almost had a moment there.

539
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:30,762
Mmm.

540
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,139
So, you want to talk the whole case through
or just the end?

541
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,146
No. The whole story
from your end, if you don't mind.

542
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:41,843
You know, like he said, files got ruined.
Hurricane Rita.

543
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:48,483
What he didn't say is that
this is about something else.

544
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,986
Something new.
That one in Lake Charles, maybe?

545
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,727
Now, why you say that?

546
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,563
Kept the details out of the paper.

547
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:01,569
Yeah, we did. You know anything about that?

548
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,571
About Lake Charles?

549
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:08,369
You ought to let me see what you got,
jog my memory.

550
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:11,676
Let's hear your story first.
See how it fits with what we got.

551
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:16,686
Well, your dime, boss.

552
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:21,216
Talking Cohle,
what about that dinner you mentioned,

553
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:22,758
he turned up drunk?

554
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:29,162
Oh. Yeah. Well, ahem, that
dinner, that was a bit later.

555
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:34,132
He was kind of funny.
The flowers, you know.

556
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:37,503
Like he read somewhere
that if you get invited to dinner,

557
00:41:37,562 --> 00:41:39,769
you're supposed to bring flowers.

558
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:41,935
What the hell?

559
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,268
You can barely stand up.

560
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,907
What, you don't drink with me or the boys,

561
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:52,684
and you got to get a load on
before you visit my family?

562
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:54,655
No, Marty, it's not like that.

563
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:59,127
I didn't mean to, all right?

564
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:04,529
I don't drink
'cause I've had trouble with it before.

565
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:06,227
I didn't mean to.

566
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:14,071
I was checking out a CI
and ended up hanging around a bar.

567
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,906
I was sitting there, and I couldn't
think of a good reason not to.

568
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:24,815
Usually I can.

569
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,895
Don't worry about it.

570
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:38,099
Have some more coffee and just try
to make 10 minutes of conversation.

571
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:39,634
You got it.

572
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:44,402
I'll call Chris or somebody,
get you out of here.

573
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:48,405
Marty.

574
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:53,040
I'm sorry, man.

575
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:55,842
Forget it.

576
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:58,985
We'll try this some other time.

577
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:13,692
Well, uh, Rust,
it is so nice to finally meet you.

578
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:16,733
Sorry it took so long.

579
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:19,775
Well, I tried to tell her
you aren't big on socializing.

580
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:23,404
I said that your life's
in this man's hands, right?

581
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:25,277
Of course you should meet the family.

582
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,585
Well, not quite as dramatic as that, hon.

583
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:31,853
I've never fired my gun.

584
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,883
Have you fired your gun?

585
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,117
Audrey.

586
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:40,519
Yes.

587
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:42,320
You shot people?

588
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:43,729
Macie.

589
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:47,727
Dad's never shot anybody.

590
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,364
Well, that's good.

591
00:43:51,496 --> 00:43:52,736
You don't want to shoot people.

592
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:54,438
But you have.

593
00:43:56,334 --> 00:43:58,541
Marty says you're from Texas.

594
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:01,083
Yes, south Texas.

595
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:04,650
I grew up in Alaska.

596
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:07,349
Just been working here
the last 10, 12 years.

597
00:44:07,445 --> 00:44:09,152
What kind of work?

598
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,155
Narcotics, mostly.

599
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:13,416
Um...

600
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:17,726
I was on the robbery squad in Houston
until '89.

601
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,357
Ahem. Oh.

602
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:21,096
Be right back.

603
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:23,299
Y'all keep eating.

604
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:30,408
Do you like your job?

605
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:35,709
Not exactly.

606
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:38,187
It's worthwhile.

607
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:39,880
I'm good at it.

608
00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:42,554
You're not married?

609
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:45,851
Once.

610
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:47,760
- Uh, not anymore.
- Mmm-hmm.

611
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:50,930
Did you do this while you were married?

612
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:53,093
Hey, Chris.

613
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,793
Hey, thanks for the page.

614
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:59,238
Yeah, well, he'll appreciate it.

615
00:45:00,665 --> 00:45:03,441
Well, all right, then I appreciate it.

616
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:13,019
- Children?

617
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,017
One.

618
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,153
She passed.

619
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,956
Marriage didn't last long after that.

620
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:25,494
Sorry.

621
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:30,267
Ahem.
Chris Demma's on the phone for you.

622
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:33,366
Something about a Cl or...

623
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,610
Back there to the left.

624
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:37,642
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

625
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,177
Ahem.

626
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,826
What was that?

627
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:53,987
What were y'all talking about?

628
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,587
Your job.

629
00:45:56,554 --> 00:45:58,158
What do you know about him' Marty?

630
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:02,398
Um...

631
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:03,938
Not a lot.

632
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:06,601
He could be a good detective.

633
00:46:06,664 --> 00:46:09,201
He's running on this thing, but, uh...

634
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:11,169
Uppity.

635
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:15,477
What?

636
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,447
Have you ever asked him about himself?

637
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:24,860
Baby, trust me,
you do not want to pick this man's brain.

638
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,261
What was that?

639
00:46:31,322 --> 00:46:34,098
Oh, some details on the CI. Ahem.

640
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:42,034
Thank you for dinner, Maggie.
This looks great.

641
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,441
My pleasure.

642
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:46,811
- I don't like that broccoli.
- Mind your manners.

643
00:46:46,871 --> 00:46:49,818
So you need to go or what?

644
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,319
No, it's nothing can't wait till tomorrow.

645
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:59,790
Rust, uh, what you were saying before?

646
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:06,063
Oh, we can find something
nicer to talk about.

647
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:09,504
Many, I saw your table in there.

648
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,335
You fly fish?

649
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,731
Little bit.

650
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,944
So, you and Cohle
went bad in '02, huh?

651
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:21,315
Heard about that.

652
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:22,918
Yeah, well,

653
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:28,087
what happened between me and him
don't have nothing to do with Dora Lange.

654
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:32,925
I worked with Rust Cohle for seven years.

655
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:36,731
People change, relationships change.

656
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:40,135
You stay in touch?

657
00:47:41,926 --> 00:47:43,530
No.

658
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:46,040
No, I haven't talked to Rust in

659
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,410
10 years.

660
00:47:50,735 --> 00:47:51,805
Yeah.

661
00:47:55,106 --> 00:47:57,108
Look, however we...

662
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,484
He was a good detective.

663
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:03,550
And it don't matter how we ended it.
I mean...

664
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:07,521
I can say that because it's the truth.

665
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:11,391
And I don't hold grudges.

666
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:15,199
I believe that's the shit
that leads to cancer.

667
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:23,370
But why am I talking about dinner?

668
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:27,177
Y'all want to walk through
the Lange case, fine.

669
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:33,214
This other stuff... What's going on?

670
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:36,091
Sorry. We just heard some stories.

671
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:40,351
Well, personally, I heard
he was an ace case man, right?

672
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:42,453
I'd like to understand his process.

673
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:49,163
Process. Sure.

674
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:55,343
The other landlord says she trashed
the place, so she lost her deposit.

675
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,538
And her neighbors check out.

676
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:02,778
Those that remember her said that she, uh,
used to come in early in the morning,

677
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,286
If she came home at all.

678
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:10,316
You guys canvass the bars
pretty good today?

679
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:15,455
Up your ass, Cohle.

680
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,126
Why don't you do your own fucking leg work,
you rat fuck?

681
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:25,837
Say it again, rummy.

682
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:27,204
Hey.

683
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,506
You know what, man?

684
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:35,481
Fuck you,

685
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:37,018
Tax Man.

686
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,114
What the fuck?

687
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:44,482
Ahem.

688
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:45,856
Back to point.

689
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,987
Got three hits on working girls.

690
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,929
No one close to her, naturally.

691
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,764
A few names recognized her as occasional.

692
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,497
Like she tricked now and then,

693
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,631
show up at a couple of truck stops
when she needed cash.

694
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:00,865
You got some names. Which ones?

695
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:04,572
I heard from my AP guy, Marie Fontenot.

696
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:08,173
Said her uncle's Danny Fontenot.
Pitcher, LSU.

697
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:11,516
Yeah, I watched him play. Great player.

698
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:13,714
- Well, he lives close by.
- Ahem.

699
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:15,347
Well, thanks, guys.

700
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,620
What about you two?
Did you get anything today?

701
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,252
Not much, sir.

702
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:24,265
Well, you might know the Reverend Tuttle.

703
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:26,494
He runs our statewide charity drive.

704
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:28,503
This is Detective Hart, Detective Cohle.

705
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,004
- Very good to meet you, Officers.
- Pleasure, sir.

706
00:50:30,094 --> 00:50:31,334
Rustin Cohle.

707
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:37,141
Your case has a lot of people taking care,
doors locking where they used to not.

708
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:41,105
Eddie's been speaking to me about it.
Concerned, very concerned.

709
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:43,885
We've been discussing
the viability of a task force

710
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:46,648
to investigate crimes
with an anti-Christian connotation.

711
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,088
You what? Really?

712
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:52,950
Yes.

713
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,533
I don't mean to tell men of your positions,

714
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:03,003
but there is a war happening behind things.

715
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,204
Thank you for doing your part.

716
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:09,244
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

717
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:12,238
Well,

718
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:18,180
Eddie's going to be very, very pleased
to have such good men working on this.

719
00:51:23,047 --> 00:51:26,119
- Are you kidding me?
- Un-fucking-believable.

720
00:51:27,151 --> 00:51:29,995
"Anti-Christian." Fucks.

721
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,199
And who the fuck's Eddie?

722
00:51:32,523 --> 00:51:33,524
Huh?

723
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:36,198
Is he serious?

724
00:51:36,327 --> 00:51:38,432
Well, he, uh, doesn't have a television.

725
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:40,338
- Who's Eddie?
- And he's from Texas.

726
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:44,277
- He's the fucking governor. Edwin Tuttle.
- Ah.

727
00:51:44,368 --> 00:51:46,075
They're first cousins.

728
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:47,907
Well, that makes sense.

729
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:50,575
Yeah, that's the sound
of the big machine, Cohle.

730
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:52,917
It's gearing up to pound your ass.

731
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,957
It's the sound of a gaggle of hens.

732
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:59,721
Yeah, you better watch your mouth
or they're gonna peck your eyes out.

733
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:03,287
- Hi.
- Hi.

734
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:07,234
I'm looking for Detective Hart.
I have a stack of depositions for him.

735
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:11,602
Judge Sutpen told me to make sure and give
them to Detective Han and no one else, so...

736
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:14,039
- Is that the, um...
- The depositions.

737
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,372
I thought I should walk you through them.

738
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:19,346
Oh. Great, great. Let's
just find a place to talk.

739
00:52:19,403 --> 00:52:20,575
Thanks, Cathleen.

740
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,278
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

741
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:24,013
Right through here.

742
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:53,415
Your victim was Dora Lange,

743
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:57,085
but you all checked on Marie Fontenot. Why?

744
00:52:58,442 --> 00:53:01,150
Missing girl, five years gone,
report made in error.

745
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:04,282
She had an uncle who lived nearby.

746
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:07,695
And call it intuition.

747
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:12,898
Sometimes he's more responsive.

748
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,401
I'd like to help.

749
00:53:21,065 --> 00:53:23,045
Mr. Fontenot. No way.

750
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,115
Uh, ahem.

751
00:53:29,473 --> 00:53:33,649
We met' uh, maybe seven years ago.

752
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:38,216
I was visiting Skip Hays.
I'd played for USL.

753
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:41,920
A thing of beauty, sir, watching you throw.

754
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:42,986
Hmm.

755
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:47,727
Danny, this man's a
detective' with the police.

756
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:51,170
He's talking to me
like I'm a child.

757
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,002
Uh...

758
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:58,069
I'm actually... Ahem-Sorry, uh...

759
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,512
We wanted to ask you
about your niece, Marie.

760
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,216
Hmm.

761
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:06,311
"How much could you put on one family?"
I ask the Lord.

762
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:08,886
We try to get by.

763
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,860
Did you know Marie's birth father'?

764
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,553
Len?

765
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,391
Len Stroghes was her daddy.

766
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:16,520
Hmm.

767
00:54:17,154 --> 00:54:18,394
Okay.

768
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:20,799
We're asking because, uh,

769
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:24,737
we had heard that Marie ran off with him
and they...

770
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:26,501
She wasn't really missing.

771
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,546
That's what Debbie said.

772
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:36,116
Oh. Well, uh, anybody heard from Len?

773
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:39,016
Anybody maybe knows where he's at?

774
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:46,321
Uh, sorry. The last thing.

775
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:47,952
Do you know where Debbie is now?

776
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:52,363
She married another man,
not the one she was with when Marie...

777
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:56,030
She was in Vegas, last we heard.

778
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,326
- Marie must have loved it here.
- Yeah.

779
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:26,396
- All this for her'?
- Danny loved her so much.

780
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:31,165
We weren't her legal guardians,
but she played here all the time.

781
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:32,571
More than her mama's.

782
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:34,766
I can see why.

783
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:39,946
What is it Dan has,
if you don't mind my asking?

784
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:43,007
All they ever told us
was a cerebral event.

785
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:45,843
A series of strokes, like.

786
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:55,494
Marty?

787
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,294
Excuse me one sec.

788
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:13,637
Inside, on the floor, on the right.

789
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:34,769
I don't know what that is.

790
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:38,170
I haven't looked in there
since the police first came.

791
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:48,246
I bet you want to hear
the hero shot, huh?

792
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,821
The place we carried the kids out?

793
00:56:53,277 --> 00:56:55,154
Eventually, sure.

794
00:56:57,881 --> 00:56:59,952
So, what did she look like?

795
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:02,864
That one in Lake Charles?

796
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:31,655
Can you, uh, tell us anything
about that, Mr. Cohle?

797
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,763
That looks a lot
like the one from '95,

798
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,160
but, well' you knew that already.

799
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:46,298
Yeah, there are specifics
consistent 10 the '95 case,

800
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:48,876
details that weren't public knowledge.

801
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:53,480
You were off the grid
for eight years, right?

802
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,982
- Show back up here 2010.
- My question is...

803
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:58,315
How could it be him

804
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:03,324
if we already caught him in '95?

805
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,261
How indeed, Detectives?

806
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,200
I figured
you'd be the one to know.

807
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:23,869
Then start asking the
right fucking questions.
