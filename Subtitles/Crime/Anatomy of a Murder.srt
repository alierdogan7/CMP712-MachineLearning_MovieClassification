00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:23,476
Hi, Toivo.

4
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,441
Hey. Your pal just drove into town,
Mr. McCarthy.

5
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:35,322
I'll have one more, Toivo.

6
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:38,158
I'm afraid I'll have to pay
my bar bill tomorrow.

7
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,285
You're good with me, Mr. McCarthy.

8
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,329
Thank you, Toivo.

00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,670

[Woman] Operator.

00:04:57,423 --> 00:05:02,302
Operator, I want, uh, 489, Thunder Bay.

12
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,429
I want to speak to Mrs. Manion.

- Well, do they know when she'll be there?
- No, they don't.

17
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:30,121
I see. Well, just leave a message,
and tell her to call this number.

18
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:32,165
Thank you.

19
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,294
All right.
What do you say there, counselor?

20
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,338
Save your money.

21
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,592
What's in the brown paper bag?

22
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,887
- [Faucet Running]
- It might be a cabbage head.

23
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,889
But it wouldn't be.

24
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,683
You're a very suspicious man.

25
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,940
True. I'm everlastingly suspicious of...

26
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,443
and/or fascinated by...

27
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:03,446
the contents of brown paper bags.

28
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:07,033
- Shall I sneak a peek?
- You do that, counselor.

29
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,663
You do that, and...

30
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:15,458
after you sneak a peek, why, you uncork...

31
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,585
whatever you find.

32
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:25,009

You've been drinkin' alone, Polly.

37
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:44,904
I don't like that.

38
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:48,324
Ah, drop the stone, counselor.
You live in a glass house.

39
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:53,162
My windows have been busted
a long time ago, so I can say as I please.

40
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,292
Have an Italian cigar?

41
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:58,876
No, thanks.

42
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,755

Polly, it's a fact.

45
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:12,599
Since Mitch Lodwick beat you
out of the office of public prosecutor...

46
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:15,184
you haven't been worth salt for peanuts.

47
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,937
Not that I don't understand how you feel.

48
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:22,942
When a man gets beat out of
an office he's held for a long time...

49
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,571
he feels his community has deserted him...

50
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,906
the finger of scorn is pointed at him.

51
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:32,285
None but the lonely heart
shall know my anguish.

52
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,996
Polly, you're a good lawyer.
You ought to make like one.

53
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,792
Be here, ready for clients, not out fishin'
and playin' that rooty-tooty jazz.

- Oh, I'm making a living.

55

from John Doe every once in a while.

Threaten a few deadbeats.

57
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,555
And in the evening I sit around
and drink bourbon whiskey...

58
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,726
and read law
with Parnell Emmett McCarthy...

59
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,187
one of the world's great men.

60
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,981
That was a kind word, Polly.

61
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:05,234
You know, I might have been.

62
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:10,239
That's one of the reasons I hate to see
your talent pushed aside by lesser men.

63
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,700
I look at you and I see myself years ago...

64
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:18,164
with the same love for the smell of the
old brown books and the dusty office.

65
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:23,169
Here's a rose, a lily...

66
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:26,172

Well, what shall we read
this evening, counselor?

69
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,767
How about a little, uh,
Chief Justice Holmes?

71
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,649
Restrain Chief Justice Holmes for a minute.
I might have a client.

00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,901
Been waiting for a call. Hello?

- Here's your party.
- Hello? Mrs. Manion?

75
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:54,033
- What?
- [Woman] Mr. Biegler?

76
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:56,744
I'm sorry I missed you a while ago.
Did you get my message?

77
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:59,122
- Who is that? What is that name?
- Just a minute, please.

78
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,958
We seem to have a bad connection.
Just hold on.

79
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,169
It's a woman name of Manion.
Maida took a message from her.

80
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:07,171
- In Thunder Bay?
- Uh-huh.

81
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,298
If she wants you to represent
her husband, say yes.

82
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,468
- I don't know what it's all about.
- Pretend you do and say yes.

83
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,220
- Hello?
- Mr. Biegler?

84
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,432
Oh, yes. It's much better now.
Yes, I can hear you fine.

- ## [Speakers: Jazz]
- I've waited for your call all afternoon.

86
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,312
Yes, well, I just got in a few moments ago.

87
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,815
You've read about my husband?
Muffy, please.

88
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,609
Yes.

89
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,318
Mr. Biegler, have you
read about my husband?

90
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,903
Muffy, please.

91
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:35,408
Well, yes, I have. A little.

92
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,619
Will you defend him?

93
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,746
I don't know.
I'd have to know more about it.

94
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,832
Will you talk to him?
Mr. Biegler, he's in the county jail.

95
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,294
Will you see him in the morning?
He's-He's very anxious to see you.

96
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:49,881
- You've been so highly recommended.
- I have?

97
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:53,134
Yeah. Someone told him about you.
Will you see him?

98
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,887
Well, I suppose I could.
I'll see him tomorrow morning.

99
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,182
Would you want me there too, Mr. Biegler?

100
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,852
I think that'd be fine.
Let's make it about 10:00, huh?

101
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,521
Thank you. Thank you so much.

102
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,607
Yes, you're quite welcome. Bye.

103
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,609
Now, what's this all about?

104
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,570
A man named Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion.

105
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,864
Her husband, he's a lieutenant in the army.

106
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,867
There's a temporary base in Thunder Bay.
Gunnery or something.

107
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:22,872
The lieutenant goes to Quill's place
and plugs Mr. Quill about five times...

108
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,374
which causes Mr. Quill
to promptly die of lead poisoning.

109
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,460
- When did all this happen?
- A couple of nights ago.

110
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,129
If you hadn't been out fishing in a rowboat
in some godforsaken backwater...

111
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:32,465
you'd have known about it.

112

00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,792
- Morning, Maida.
- Oh, there it is.

115
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:51,794
- What?
- The newspaper.

116
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:55,131
I thought maybe they didn't bring it.
We haven't paid the bill.

117
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,050
- Did you get my note?
- Uh-huh. We may be in the case.

118
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:01,304
I'm just reading up on it
now before talking to Lieutenant Manion.

119
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,515
- Doesn't he ever go home?
- You mean Parnell?

120
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,852
- We were up late last night.
- Is that a fact?

121
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:11,564
Yeah. I think maybe you'd better cancel
all my appointments for today.

122
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:15,902
What appointments?
People think you migrated into the woods.

123
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:19,322
If this refrigerator gets
any more fish in it...

124
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,324
it'll swim upstream and
spawn, all by itself.

[Muttering]

126
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:27,413
May I have your attention
for a moment, please?

127
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,396
Yeah.

128
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:31,834
I was going over your
checkbook yesterday.

129
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,211
- I can't pay me my salary.
- [Mutters]

130
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:36,672
What did you do with the fee
for the Walkers' divorce?

131
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,966
Help salt a uranium mine or something?

132
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:43,846
- Uh, I bought a few bare necessities.
- Like a new outboard motor.

133
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:47,058
I wish I could be classed as a necessity.

134
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,060
- Aren't you gonna have your toast?
- No, no.

135
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:52,146
I'll, uh... I'll, uh...

136
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,398
call you and let you know
how things are going.

137
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,734
Now don't let him pay you off
in purple hearts.

138
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,570
Those professional soldiers
never have a dime.

139
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:02,323
I ought to know. I was married to one.

140
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,137
I beg your pardon. Are you Mrs. Manion?

141
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,473
- Hi.
- I'm Paul Biegler.

142
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,475
- I'm Laura.
- How do you do?

143
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:34,438
- This is Muff.
- Hello, Muff. The jail's right here.

144
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,111
You're tall.

145
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,741
- [Man] Hello, Polly.
- Hi, Sulo.

146
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,743
You wait here, Muffy.

147
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,750
- Good to see you, Polly.
- How ya feelin'?

148
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,253
Fine. I guess you come for the soldier boy.

149
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,548
Yeah. Sulo, do you think it'd be all right
if we talked in the sheriff's office?

150
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,758
Oh, sure, Polly. I'll bring him down.

151
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:17,106
Would you mind taking your glasses off,
Mrs. Manion?

152
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,610
Gee whiz. Barney Quill do that to you?

153
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,738
Mm-hmm. More than that.

154
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,865
You should see. All over.

155
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,911
Well, you can put them back on
if it's more comfortable for ya.

156
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,256
This is Polly Biegler.
This is the bucko, Polly.

157
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,258
- Lieutenant Manion.
- Hello there.

158
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,260
- Hi, Manny.
- Hello, Laura.

159
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,391
Uh, Mrs. Manion, I wonder
if you could meet me

160
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:54,226
down at my office about
2:00 this afternoon.

161
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,312
It's 305 West Barnham.

162
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,355
- Of course.
- Fine.

163
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,735
- Is there anything I can get you, hon?
- I'm all right, hon.

164
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,322
Right in here.

165
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,629
"Wanted." The big ten.

166
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,632
[Chuckles]
They got the ten best-dressed dames...

167
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:28,010
the ten top teams, the ten top tunes...

168
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,012
and now, the ten most wanted.

169
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,244
Well, don't knock it.
That's the American dream.

170
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:34,391
Those boys made the grade.

171
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:39,647
You were the... district attorney
around here, weren't you?

172
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,649
Mm-hmm. Ten years.

173
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,193
What's your experience as a defense lawyer?

174
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,153
Not very much.

175
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:48,155
How do I know you can handle my case?

176
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,200
Well, I guess you don't know.

177
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,202
Shall we talk about it?

178
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,789
I suppose so.

179
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,500
Well, now, come on, Lieutenant.
Don't be so bored.

180
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:03,212
You know, it might very well be
that no lawyer can handle your case...

181
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,214
if you mean getting off scot-free.

182
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,759
You seem to be forgetting
Barney Quill raped my wife.

183
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:10,719
I have the unwritten law on my side.

184
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,722
The unwritten law is a myth, Lieutenant.

185
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,600
There is no such thing
as the unwritten law...

186
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:19,728
and anyone who commits a murder
on the theory that it does exist...

187
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:23,065
has just bought himself
room and board in the state penitentiary.

188
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,900
Maybe for life.

189
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,778
Now, with that in mind...

190
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:33,325
perhaps we can proceed with a few questions
and answers that... that, uh...

191
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,536
Can I borrow your lighter?

192
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,771
We can proceed with a few
questions and answers

193
00:16:40,772 --> 00:16:43,169
that might be of some
help in your defense.

194
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,882
But probably won't be.

195
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,927
Yeah. Nice lighter.

196
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:57,892
- Okay.
- Well, how old are you?

197
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,269
- Twenty-eight.
- How long have you been in the service?

198
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,730
Since '50.

199
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,107
- You seen any action?
- Korea.

200
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,568
- Have any decorations?
- Plenty.

201
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,570
Is this your first marriage?

202
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,238
No.

203
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:14,408
You're not on the witness stand.
You don't have to answer yes or no.

204
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,411
Just give me the matrimonial rundown.

205
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:21,123
- Is this necessary?
- I'll be the judge of that.

206
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,211
My first wife divorced me.

207
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:28,130
Charged cruelty. [Chuckles]

208
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:31,133
Eating crackers in bed.
You know, the usual stuff.

209
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:36,388
Truth was, she found another guy
when I was in Korea.

210
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,852
I met Laura four years ago in Georgia.

211
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:44,647
We were married right after her divorce.

212
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,774
Did you know the husband?

213
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,694
- He was in my outfit down there.
- You mean you were buddies?

214
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:54,823
I'll withdraw the question.
That's a little old-fashioned.

215
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:58,410
Have there been any children by or from
any of these marriages?

216
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,914
- No.
- Any present prospects?

217
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,083
Not unless Barney Quill started something.

218
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,335
What kind of a gun did you use on Quill?

219
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,797
War souvenir. Luger.
The police have it now.

220
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:13,342
I suppose you've read the newspapers,
the stories about your case?

221
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,928
- Some of them.
- Are they substantially correct?

222
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,137
Yes.

223
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:20,015
And you didn't see Quill
rape and beat your wife?

224
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,142
No. No.

225
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:26,689
When she got back, uh, to the trailer,
she told me what had happened.

226
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,566
Then how long was it before you went
over to Quill's and killed him?

227
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,527
I don't know exactly. Maybe an hour.

228
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,988
That long, huh?

229
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:37,283
Now, the newspapers say that your wife
volunteered to take a lie detector test.

230
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,034
You know anything about this?

231
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,370
Only what I read and what she told me.

232
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,872
Do you know how
the lie detector test turned out?

233
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,375
- They didn't tell her.
- Yes, Sulo?

234
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,087
Polly, we got lunch served for the jail.
You want to eat with us?

235
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,215
Does your sister still cook for the jail?

236
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,093
- Oh, sure. She cooks.
- Uh-huh.

237
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,513
Well, you give her my compliments, Sulo.

238
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,558
- I've got a luncheon date downtown.
- Nice going, Mr. Biegler.

239
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,935
- I'll be back after lunch.
- Look, uh...

240
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,479
I'm sorry if I offended you a while ago.

241
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,149
No, you're not.

242
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,485
Come on, bucko.

243
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,070
Thank you.

244
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,824
Pass the salt, Polly.

245
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,828
Thank you.

246
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,707
Did you give the lieutenant
the well-known lecture?

247
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,627
If you mean did I coach him
into a phony story, no.

248
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:34,340
Maybe you're too pure, Paul.

249
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,967
Too pure for the natural
impurities of the law.

250
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:42,097
Could be that you owe the lieutenant
a chance to find a defense.

251
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,308
Could also be that you might
guide him a little...

252
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,394
show him the way,
and let him decide if he wants to take it.

253
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:50,147
- Want some salt?
- No. I'm not ready.

254
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,358
Anyway, I'm not the right lawyer
for this fellow.

255
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,860
He's insolent, hostile.

256
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,864
You don't have to love him.
Just defend him.

257
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,784
What's the matter? Don't you need a fee?

258
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:06,663
You know something?
I think you might be a little bit afraid.

259
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:09,833
- Afraid of what?
- That you might get licked.

260
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:17,508
You know, there's only one thing more
devious than a Philadelphia lawyer...

261
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,718
and that's an Irish lawyer.

262
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:21,720
Pass the salt.

263
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:26,225
Put it down. Put it down.

264
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:37,236
- Hello there.
- I usually answer to the name Paul.

265
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,321
Are we gonna have some more jokes?

266
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,490
Not unless you want to be the comic.

267
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,033
Oh.

268
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:45,160
I brought you some cigarettes.

269
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,162
- Oh, thanks.
- Peace?

270
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,332
- Oh, sure.
- Fine, fine. Now, Lieutenant...

271
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,961
there are four ways I can defend murder.

272
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,339
Number one, it wasn't murder.
It was suicide or accidental.

273
00:20:57,424 --> 00:21:00,426
Number two, you didn't do it.
Number three, you were legally justified...

274
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,719
like the protection of your home
or self-defense.

275
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:06,348
Number four, the killing was excusable.

276
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,643
Where do I fit into this rosy picture?

277
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:13,981
I'll tell you where you don't fit.
You don't fit in any of the first three.

278
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:17,818
Why? Why wouldn't I be legally justified
in killing the man who raped my wife?

279
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,486
Time element.

280
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:22,197
If you'd caught him in the act,
the shooting might have been justified...

281
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,032
but you didn't catch him in the act.

282
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,869
You had time to bring in the police,
and you didn't do that either.

283
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:30,164
You're guilty of murder,
premeditated and with vengeance.

284
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,166
That's first-degree murder
in any court of law.

285
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,168
Are you telling me to plead guilty?

286
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,170
When I advise you to cop out, you'll know.

287
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:38,672
- "Cop out"?
- That's plead guilty and ask for mercy.

288
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:42,176
Well, if you're not telling me to cop out,
what are you telling me to do?

289
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,178
I'm not telling you to do anything.

290
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:47,306
I just want you to understand
the letter of the law.

291
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,811
- Go on.
- Go on with what?

292
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,149
Whatever it is you're getting at.

293
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,364
You know, you're very bright, Lieutenant.

294
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:09,244
Now let's see how really bright you can be.

295
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:15,417
Well... I'm working at it.

296
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,879
All right. Because your wife was raped...

297
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,340
you'll have a favorable atmosphere
in the courtroom.

298
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:24,301
The sympathy will be with you,
if all the facts are true.

299
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,450
What you need is a legal
peg so that the jury

300
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:28,514
can hang up their
sympathy in your behalf.

301
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:32,059
- You follow me?
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:35,437
What's your legal excuse, Lieutenant?

303
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:40,025
What's your legal excuse
for killing Barney Quill?

304
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,279
Not justification, huh?

305
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,323
Not justification.

306
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,205
Excuse.

307
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,669
J-Just excuse.

308
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,101
What excuses are there?

309
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,895
How should I know?
You're the one that plugged Quill.

310
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,817
- I must've been mad.
- How's that?

311
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,736
I said I must've been mad.

312
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,326
No, a bad temper's no excuse.

313
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:36,915
Well, I mean, uh, I...
I must've been crazy.

314
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:43,547
Am I getting warmer?

315
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:50,095
- Okay, Sulo.
- Paul?

316
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,348
Am I getting warmer?

317
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:55,767
Well, I'll tell you that
after I talk to your wife.

318
00:23:55,852 --> 00:24:00,063
In the meantime, see if you can remember
just how crazy you were.

319
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:08,363
- [Typing]
- Mrs. Manion here yet?

320
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,533
- ## [Jazz]
- She's been waiting quite a while.

321
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:14,911
She's been through all your albums
from Dixieland to Brubeck.

322
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:18,415
- What do you think of her?
- Soft, easy.

323
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:22,044
The kind men like to take advantage of...
and do.

324
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,212
- Did you get any money?
- Huh?

325
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:26,590
- Money.
- Oh. Oh, no.

326
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,800
I haven't decided to take the case yet.

327
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:32,512
You know, you surprise me sometimes.

328
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:35,015
Why? I've been around.

329
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,517
Yeah, well...

330
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:44,650
- ## [Loud Dixieland Jazz]
- Hi.

331
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,861
Hi.

332
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:53,492
- I, uh...
- ## [Stops]

333
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:57,245
I hope you don't mind.
I think we'd better talk.

334
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,623
You're a funny kind of a lawyer.

335
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:04,169
- The music, I mean.
- Aren't lawyers supposed to like music?

336
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,838
Well, not that kind of music.

337
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:10,467
Well, I guess that settles it.
I'm a funny kind of lawyer.

338
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,762
Where's your home, Mrs. Manion?
Where'd you go to school?

339
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,431
Where'd you live when
you were growing up?

340
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,015
Oh, no place in particular.

341
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,081
We sort of moved around.

342
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:21,061
My father was a boomer...
construction boomer.

343
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,105
Building dams, mostly.

344
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,898
You can call me Laura.

345
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:29,778
- Is your family still alive, Laura?
- No.

346
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,822
I don't know. I have some
cigarettes around here someplace.

347
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:34,282
- Do you want a cigarette?
- No, I wanted to offer you one.

348
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:37,285
- You could light it for me.
- Oh, yes.

349
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,872
Here.

350
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:42,979
That's just like your
husband's, isn't it?

351
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,084
Mm-hmm.

352
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,131
He gave me this because
I liked the one he had.

353
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,383
He's like that.
He gives me presents all the time.

354
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,343
Do you have a happy marriage?

355
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,846
Yes.

356
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,807
What went wrong with the first marriage?

357
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:02,060
Well, what went wrong is
when I went for Manny.

358
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,104
Well, that's honest enough.

359
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:07,441
It was more than just that.
Like I told you, I grew up on the move...

360
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:10,193
and Jack... that was my first husband...

361
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:14,072
Jack didn't like to move. He wouldn't even
take a transfer when he had the chance.

362
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:16,116
I was really bored.

363
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,036
Manny likes to go. We're always
going, whenever we get the chance.

364
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:22,831
We've been all over. I'm thirsty.

365
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,083
Water? Or would a beer do?

366
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:27,085
I think a beer would do fine.

367
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,338
Maida, bring me a bottle of beer,
will you?

368
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,760
- Are you married?
- No.

369
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,304
That's nice.

370
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,807
What do you do alone
in this house if you aren't married?

371
00:26:40,892 --> 00:26:43,894
Well, it's a family home.
I'm the last of the family.

372
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,937
- There you are.
- Thank you.

373
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:50,358
- Aren't you having one?
- No, not right now. Thanks.

374
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:53,361
- There you are.
- [Muff Whines]

375
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:56,490
Oh, could Muff have a little?
In that ashtray, maybe. He loves beer.

376
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:59,034
- You want a beer for the dog?
- Mm-hmm.

377
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,536
Well, here we are.

378
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,752
[Laura] He'll go to sleep now.

379
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:14,424
- Isn't he cute?
- Yeah.

380
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:16,843
Well, how about it? Are you ready?

381
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:21,348
I mean, are you ready to tell me the story?

382
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:23,517
I know what you mean.

383
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:28,230
Yeah. Well, now, suppose you tell me
everything you told the state police...

384
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:31,733
plus everything you didn't
tell the state police.

385
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:36,905
- Where shall I begin?
- What time did you leave for Quill's bar?

386
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:40,325
Right after dinner. About 8:30, I guess.

387
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,744
Manny was late getting home
from the firing range...

388
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:45,705
so we had dinner
and he laid down and went to sleep.

389
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,874
I hadn't been out of
the trailer almost all day...

390
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:51,211
so I took Muff and a flashlight
and walked over to the bar.

391
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:53,964
I bought a drink
and played the pinball machine.

392
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:55,549
Many people in the bar?

393
00:27:55,633 --> 00:28:00,554
Not many. Barney came over
and challenged me to a game.

394
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:03,807
- For drinks, you know.
- How well did you know Barney?

395
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:07,435
Well, he owned this bar where Manny
and I went sometimes. That's all.

396
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,023
- Had he ever made a pass at you?
- No. Nothing like that at all.

397
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,651
Was he drinking heavily that night?

398
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:18,864
He didn't seem to be.
At least not when we were playing pinball.

399
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:21,575
Were you with him
the whole time you were there?

400
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,743
Oh, no. There were other
people playing too.

401
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:26,288
What time did you leave the bar?

402
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:29,541
Oh, about 11:00, I guess.

403
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,961
I left by the side door.
Muff was carrying the flashlight.

404
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,921
He carries it in his mouth.

405
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:37,007
He's so cute running along ahead
with the light shining.

406
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,801
- Was he sober?
- Muff? Of course he was sober.

407
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:41,803
Oh, you're joking now, aren't you?

408
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:45,223
Yes, I'm joking. Uh, go on.

409
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:49,477
Well, Barney came from somewhere.
Not the door I left by.

410
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:52,981
And he said he was going my way
and he could drive me home.

411
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,693
He said the bears had been prowling around
that night, and I oughtn't to walk home.

412
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,987
The bears come out of the woods
at night to scavenge.

413
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,114
Yeah, but they're harmless enough,
aren't they?

414
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,950
Yeah. I suppose I wouldn't have
been afraid in the daylight...

415
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:06,119
but, well, the dark isn't
the same, you know.

416
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:09,372
Yes, I know. I know.
Now, you got into Barney's car.

417
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:11,708
I got in and he drove
straight to the trailer park.

418
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,710
He made overtures?

419
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,087
No, nothing.
When we got to the trailer park...

420
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:18,089
the auto gate was closed.

421
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:21,843
Mr. Lemon closes it
about 11:00 or a little after.

422
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:24,512
So I thanked Barney
and started to get out of the car...

423
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:27,390
but he said that there wasn't
any need for me to walk...

424
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:30,268
that he could drive me
into the park on another road.

425
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:35,523
I didn't know there was another road, but
he drove on before I could say yes or no.

426
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:38,026
- Were you alarmed?
- No.

427
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,195
I'm not usually afraid of men.

428
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,823
And anyway, he hadn't touched me
or even said anything out of the way.

429
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:49,329
Well, doesn't a woman sort of instinctively
know when a fellow's on the make?

430
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,540
Oh, sure. But that's only usual with me.

431
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:55,669
With men, I mean... almost all men.
Ever since I was a kid.

432
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,630
You, for instance. You're interested.

433
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,674
But there isn't any reason
to be afraid of you.

434
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:02,634
It was like that with Barney.

435
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,886
Well, now, Mrs. Manion,
believe me, I'm not in the least...

436
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:07,222
Call me Laura.

437
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,224
Uh, Laura.

438
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,435
I'm only interested in
helping your husband.

439
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:13,561
Nothing more.

440
00:30:13,646 --> 00:30:16,231
Oh, I don't mean you'd try anything.

441
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:20,026
I just mean it's...
it's the way you look at me.

442
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,030
Well, it'd be very difficult
not to look at you.

443
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:26,908
Oh, the way I dress, you mean?
You don't like it?

444
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:30,036
Oh, I love it. I just love it.

445
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:34,082
Now, we-we'd better keep
moving along with this thing.

446
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:38,044
Now, uh, how were you dressed that night?

447
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:40,880
Oh, in a sweater like this and a skirt.

448
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:43,341
And the rest. What about that?

449
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:44,926
Underneath?

450
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:48,096
I had on a slip and panties and a bra.

451
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,765
- No girdle?
- I don't need a girdle.

452
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,600
Do you think I need a girdle?

453
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,936
I don't know.

454
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,105
I don't know. How sh... I...

455
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,899
Look, I'm only concerned
with a few facts...

456
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:02,610
that might be of help to me
in the defense of your husband.

457
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:05,363
- That's all.
- Well, I don't wear one.

458
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:09,367
Okay. No girdle. Okay.
All right. Now go on.

459
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:13,163
Well, he turned off the highway
into a lane in the woods...

460
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:16,082
and he stopped the car
and turned off the lights.

461
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:18,251
And then he grabbed me, and he said...

462
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,670
"I'm gonna rape you,"
just like that.

463
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:23,923
- Did he use those words?
- Exactly those words.

464
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:26,509
Muff began to bark,
so he threw him out the window.

465
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:30,346
I could hear little Muffy
whining outside the car all through it.

466
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,641
Barney began to try to get at me...

467
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:36,811
and I fought him off as best I could,
but he was terribly strong.

468
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:39,230
Did you cry out? Did you scream?

469
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:42,150
It didn't seem to be much use
out there in the woods.

470
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:47,155
He began to shout names at me
like "army slut" and some other names.

471
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,824
And then he drew back and
hit me with his fist.

472
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:52,786
He hit me again, and I
didn't fight anymore.

473
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:58,249
I must've been only half conscious,
but I know that he tore my panties off...

474
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,251
and did what he wanted.

475
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,379
Now, the newspapers said
that a doctor examined you...

476
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:05,507
and said that he didn't
think you'd been raped.

477
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:09,344
I don't care what the doctor thought.
A woman doesn't mistake these things.

478
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:12,472
All right. All right. Now go ahead.

479
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,140
Well, I...

480
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,144
I don't know exactly what happened then.
I must've fainted.

481
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:21,356
But the next thing I remember,
the car was moving.

482
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,610
Barney was driving very fast,
and... and he was breathing hard.

483
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:29,030
An ugly, gasping sound.

484
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:32,742
We were on the main road
to the trailer park...

485
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:35,578
and he swung in by the gate and stopped.

486
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,769
I opened the door to get out.
Muffy jumped out

487
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,874
first, with a lighted
flashlight in his mouth.

488
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,043
Well, now, wait a minute.
I thought you said...

489
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:44,546
he'd thrown Muff out of the car
back in the woods.

490
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,257
Well, he did, but Muff was
in the car when we got back.

491
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,217
He must've let him back in.
I don't remember.

492
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,846
All right. All right. Now, you opened the
door, and Muff got out first. All right.

493
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,557
Before I could get out,
Barney grabbed me...

494
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,893
and said he was gonna tear all my
clothes off and attack me again.

495
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,688
I got away and ran.

496
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:02,397
I could see Muff at an
opening in the fence.

497
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,900
He was scooting back and forth
with the flashlight.

498
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:09,946
Barney caught me from behind,
and I fell to the ground.

499
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,866
He fell on top of me and began
to beat me again with his fists.

500
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,868
I thought he was gonna kill me.

501
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:19,581
I screamed, and somehow or other
I got to my feet again and ran.

502
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:22,250
I went through the opening
in the fence and followed Muffy.

503
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,544
He was running along ahead
with the flashlight.

504
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:27,589
And I kept following the light
until he led me to our trailer.

505
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,883
And you didn't see Barney again?

506
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:32,719
Never laid eyes on him
again, dead or alive.

507
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,722
Well, I...

508
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:37,682
I think that's enough for now.

509
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:40,977
I've got lots of time. All you want.

510
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:44,355
Where can I reach you?

511
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,192
I'm still in Thunder Bay,
but I can drive down again in the morning.

512
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,781
- Was there something else?
- No.

513
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:08,463
Thanks for letting me play the records.

514
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,549
- Oh, you're very welcome.
- Thanks a lot. Bye.

515
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,931
- Who's that?
- The lady in the case.

516
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:19,307
Oh.

517
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,810
And you're not gonna take the case, huh?

518
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:27,148
Well, I don't know. That depends on
what Manion has to tell me tomorrow.

519
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:29,776
He's thinking things out.

520
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,903
Oh, well, that's more like it.

521
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:35,073
Now, if I take the case, I want you in it.

522
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:39,077
Me? In a big murder case?

523
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,872
Why, Polly, the sight of
this whiskey-drinking

524
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:44,040
old man at the counsel
table would ruin you.

525
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,709
I need you.

526
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:48,836
Do you mean that?

527
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,506
Why else would he say it?

528
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:55,093
Well, I'd be glad to work with you
outside of the courtroom...

529
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,095
but not in the courtroom.

530
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:01,432
Well, suit yourself about that. Either way,
I'm gonna have to be able to depend on you.

531
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,687
Will you lay off the booze?

532
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:15,571
I don't know.
I don't know about that, Polly.

533
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:17,615
Why don't you know?

534
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,495
Do you think I could lay off the booze?

535
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:25,498
[Maida] Ever tried it?

536
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,419
Try it.

537
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:36,134
I've never been on a big murder case.

538
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:39,470
Not once in all my life.

539
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:41,472
It's up to you, Parn.

540
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:50,773
Will you be around tonight?

541
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:54,360
Yeah. Yeah. I'll be around.

542
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:06,247
You know, Maida, darlin'...

543
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:09,250
I might manage it.

544
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:12,378
I might manage to be a real lawyer again.

545
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,673
For a little while anyway.

546
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,262
I tried remembering.

547
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:23,723
There were still some pieces missing.

548
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:27,226
I remember...

549
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,939
going to Quill's bar with a gun...

550
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:35,651
and I remember Quill's face behind the bar.

551
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,947
But I don't remember anything else,
not even going home.

552
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:42,033
Don't you remember firing the gun?

553
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,452
Five shots.
That's a lot of noise to forget.

554
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:48,498
Yeah, I remember hearing shots, but they
don't seem to be connected with me.

555
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:50,541
They seemed far away...

556
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:53,920
like somebody else was doing the shooting.

557
00:36:58,217 --> 00:37:01,886
Lieutenant Manion, I'll, uh...
I'll take your case.

558
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,722
Why, thanks. Thanks, Mr. Biegler.

559
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:07,975
All right. Now, there's
the little matter of the fee.

560
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,977
Three thousand dollars.
That's reasonable enough, isn't it?

561
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,979
Oh, sure, sure. More than reasonable.

562
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,065
I'll have to pay you later.
Right now I'm broke.

563
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,526
- You're what?
- I'm broke. I'm flat busted.

564
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,986
I don't have three dollars,
much less 3,000.

565
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:22,990
- Well, can you raise it?
- Oh, yeah, as soon as I get outta jail.

566
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:26,077
But, uh, next week's payday.

567
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:29,080
I'll, uh...
I'll be able to give you $150.

568
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:32,375
And if you get me off, I'll give you
a promissory note for the rest.

569
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:36,129
All right. Now, suppose I don't go along
with you unless you pay me half the fee?

570
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:40,216
Well, I'll have to take
the lawyer the court appoints.

571
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,928
- I got my defense now. Right? Insanity.
- Yeah.

572
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,848
I think I'll stick around
and make damn sure you get off.

573
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:51,144
- Where do we start?
- We're gonna need a psychiatrist.

574
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:53,313
As much as neither one
of us has any money,

575
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,398
do you think the army'll
stir one up for you?

576
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,400
Well, I know a colonel in the Pentagon.

577
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,610
- I'll write a letter.
- Good. Do that. Sulo.

578
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,285
Where are you going now?

579
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,662
I'm going to see your wife, for one thing.

580
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:12,206
Why? Didn't you see her yesterday?

581
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,333
That's right. I did.

582
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,627
She's a very pretty woman, your wife.

583
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,339
A man gets used to the
way his wife looks.

584
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,174
Yeah. I can see that.

585
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:23,176
I'll see ya.

586
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:42,278
Come on in, Polly. Come on in.

587
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,989
You haven't been in here since you vacated,
have you, Polly?

588
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:47,492
- No.
- Hardly recognize the old place, huh?

589
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:50,077
Mary did it for me.
She just finished a decorator's course.

590
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:52,580
Smart girl.
Very smart girl. Look at this.

591
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,416
- A real, genuine Picasso print.
- It's very nice.

592
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:58,586
And here, try this chair.
It sort of does things for you.

593
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,755
- Huh?
- Yeah. Sit right down.

594
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,549
[Mechanical Rattling]

595
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,258
Great, isn't it?
Good for the nerves, they say.

596
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:07,929
- Yeah. How do you shut it off?
- There. Here we are.

597
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,681
- Feel better?
- I feel all shook up.

598
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,141
Whew!

599
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:17,355
Uh, Mitch, I just dropped by to tell you
I've got both feet in the Manion case.

600
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,398
- You're going to cop out, aren't you?
- No.

601
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:21,276
That's a mistake, Polly.
It's open and shut.

602
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:23,069
Well, maybe. We'll see.

603
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,071
Judge Maitland is still in the hospital.

604
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:27,615
Maybe you'd like to agree
to a continuance until he gets back.

605
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,909
If we go with the case now,
we'll have to try...

606
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,203
before some grab-bag judge they'll send in.

607
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,872
- Me, I'd rather have Maitland.
- Yeah. So would I.

608
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:38,042
But of course that'd also mean my client
would lie around in jail...

609
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,503
for another two, three months
before the trial.

610
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:44,298
Now, if you'll drop the charge
down to manslaughter...

611
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:47,218
so I can get him out on bail,
we'll agree to a continuance.

612
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,637
You wouldn't do that if you were still D.A.

613
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,139
Oh, I don't know. I might.

614
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:55,142
I might, since a great big fat
lie detector test on his wife...

615
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,562
has given proof to the rape story.

616
00:39:57,646 --> 00:40:01,023
- He'd have the jury with him.
- How did you know what the lie...

617
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:03,025
- Bit, didn't I?
- Yeah. You did.

618
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,653
Anyway, the result of a lie detector test
isn't admissible evidence.

619
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:09,490
- You can't use it.
- No, but it carries moral weight.

620
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:12,952
[Mutters] Mitch, I wouldn't
sit in that chair too much.

621
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,454
It could shake a fellow's brains loose.

622
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:17,456
I'll see you later.

623
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:24,755
[Muff Barks]

624
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:28,426
He remembers you, Paul. He likes you.

625
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,428
- He likes the beer in my icebox.
- [Laughs]

626
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:32,805
Well, what's the occasion today?
A buffalo hunt?

627
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,933
I bought these in Arizona
when we were stationed there.

628
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:37,978
Aren't they smart?
I think they're very smart.

629
00:40:37,979 --> 00:40:39,937
Here. We can sit in my car.

630
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:48,696
Here you are.

631
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:51,782
Here you go, Muffy.

632
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,118
Several things have occurred to me.

633
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,162
The, uh...

634
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:59,874
The undergarments
that Barney Quill tore off.

635
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,376
Who has them now? The police?

636
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:04,545
You mean my panties?

637
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,547
All right. Your panties.

638
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,549
I haven't seen them since.

639
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:10,551
I gave the torn skirt
and sweater to the police...

640
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:14,221
and then I went with them up that lane
into the woods to look for the panties.

641
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:16,329
But we couldn't find
anything but my glasses.

642
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:18,351
Your glasses?

643
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:20,394
You mean you were wearing glasses
through all that?

644
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:23,314
No. I had them in a case in my hand.

645
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:26,233
I wear them for reading, playing pinball.
Things like that.

646
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:28,736
I must've tried to get
out of the car and dropped them.

647
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,696
Uh-huh.

648
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:34,367
You, uh, might be interested to know
that your lie detector test...

649
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:36,577
turned out in your favor.

650
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:39,497
Of course it did.
I could've told you it would.

651
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:44,168
- You weren't worried about it?
- No. Why should I be?

652
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:47,838
Would you like to have
something to worry about?

653
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:49,548
[Chuckles] Silly.

654
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:51,926
Like your husband watching us
from his cell window?

655
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:59,058
All right. All right. Let's have it.

656
00:42:00,811 --> 00:42:03,771
- Did he say something to you?
- Just enough.

657
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,898
Are you afraid of him?

658
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,442
Yes.

659
00:42:08,527 --> 00:42:11,612
Is that why you volunteered
for a lie detector test? For him?

660
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:15,533
- Yeah.
- Mmm. Does he have reason to be jealous?

661
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:18,953
He was jealous even before we were married.

662
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,122
I should have known how it would be.

663
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,709
It's funny though. He...
He likes to show me off.

664
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,961
He likes me to dress the way I do.

665
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:30,005
And then he gets furious
if a man pays any attention to me.

666
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:33,092
I've tried to leave him, but I can't.

667
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,177
He begs. I give in.

668
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,849
Now, if you think I've forgotten
my question, I haven't.

669
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,977
- I have.
- All right.

670
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,438
All right. Then I'll ask it again.

671
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:48,566
Does your husband
have any reason to be jealous?

672
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,652
No.

673
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:54,155
Not once. Not ever.

674
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:03,742
[Door Opens]

675
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:14,670
All right? You like the place all right?

676
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:17,131
I was just lookin' at these pictures.

677
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:20,801
- That was Barney Quill, wasn't it?
- That's right. Barney Quill.

678
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:23,262
- I'm Paul Biegler...
- I know who you are.

679
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:25,598
Seen you around Iron City.

680
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:29,894
- You didn't tell me your name.
- Paquette. We don't open till 5:00.

681
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:33,564
That's all right. I can wait.
I don't have the shakes yet. [Chuckles]

682
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,775
You were on the job that
night, weren't you?

683
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,069
The night Barney Quill was killed.

684
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:41,488
Like the newspaper said, I was present.

685
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:45,117
You were the fellow that stopped
Lieutenant Manion outside.

686
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:48,662
That's right. He, uh...
He pointed the gun at me and said...

687
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:50,497
"You want some too, buster?"

688
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:53,167
And you said no,
because your name isn't buster.

689
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:55,753
There wasn't anything funny
about it, Mr. Biegler.

690
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:58,464
No. There wasn't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

691
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:02,176
Where were you when Barney Quill
was killed, Mr. Paquette?

692
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:05,012
[Sighs]

693
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,640
I gather you don't want to
talk about that night, huh?

694
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:10,184
That's right.
I don't want to talk about it.

695
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:13,228
Have to talk to me about it in court.
Why not now?

696
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:16,565
Because I don't have to now.
Reason enough, okay?

697
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:17,858
Okay.

698
00:46:18,777 --> 00:46:23,697
Okay. Boy, old Barney, he was kind of
a rugged character, wasn't he?

699
00:46:23,782 --> 00:46:27,868
Ex-prize fighter, muscle man.
Fancy with guns.

700
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:30,371
He paid his debts, ran a clean place.

701
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:33,415
- Me, I liked him.
- You run the place now?

702
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,044
No, I just work here.
Mary's running things.

703
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,296
Mary. Was that Barney's wife?

704
00:46:39,381 --> 00:46:42,591
No. He wasn't... He didn't have a wife.
Mary was his manager.

705
00:46:42,676 --> 00:46:46,553
Oh. Gee, I wonder
who's gonna inherit the place.

706
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:50,015
- Mary, I guess.
- Hmm, Mary again?

707
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,017
What's the matter with that?

708
00:46:52,102 --> 00:46:55,187
You mean what's the matter with Mary?
I don't know what's the matter with Mary.

709
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:57,147
Mary what?

710
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:59,066
Pilant. Mary Pilant.

711
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,068
She's in the back booth.

712
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:04,405
We don't talk about our customers here,
but if we did...

713
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:07,533
- Which we don't...
- Thank you.

714
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:10,202
[Whispers]
That's her. That's Mary Pilant.

715
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:21,296
Do you know Lieutenant Manion's wife?

716
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:23,674
Sure. I know the lieutenant too.

717
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:26,593
He's a good officer. She's all right too.

718
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:29,054
- Friendly. Good kid.
- [Laughs]

719
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:31,056
What do you know about it?
Knock it off.

720
00:47:31,141 --> 00:47:33,934
I didn't mean anything.
She's a dish. What's the matter with that?

721
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:36,562
You want this lawyer to get wrong ideas?

722
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,857
What chances has the lieutenant got,
Mr. McCarthy?

723
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:43,694
Pretty good, I'd say, with a couple
of character witnesses like you.

724
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:50,409
I'd like to help him out. I sure would, but
we're moving out. The whole outfit. Berlin.

725
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:52,911
Oh. Uh, tell me...

726
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:55,831
who is this babe at the hotel?

727
00:47:55,915 --> 00:48:00,502
Name's Mary Pilant.
She was Quill's private property.

728
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:16,060
- Would you like a table, sir?
- Yes, please.

729
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:25,736
- Will you be alone?
- I'll be joined by two others.

730
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:29,406
- May I take your hat?
- Well, thank you. Thank you very much.

731
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:38,290
How was the manicure?

732
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:41,502
Just ask me any questions about anybody.
I've got all the dope.

733
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:44,588
Well, can you tell me about a woman
by the name of Mary Pilant?

734
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:46,340
Easy.

735
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:50,594
Mary Pilant may or may not have been
the mistress of the late B. Quill.

736
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,179
Oh?

737
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,680
The manicurist is in favor
of the mistress theory...

738
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:55,682
but the hairdresser is agin it.

739
00:48:55,767 --> 00:49:00,521
However, they both agree that some sort of
hanky-panky must've been going on.

740
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,689
- To be continued.
- Menu?

741
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:04,691
Thank you.

742
00:49:06,236 --> 00:49:08,654
- Pretty, huh?
- Yes, she's very pretty.

743
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:10,531
Well, go on. Go on.

744
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:12,825
Well, anyway, there's
one story that says

745
00:49:12,826 --> 00:49:15,035
that Barney's wild night
with Mrs. Manion...

746
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,205
was somehow triggered by Mary Pilant.

747
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:22,209
Seemed she'd been running around with
some soldier, and Barney blew his stack.

748
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:25,712
- He got tanked up and exploded.
- Is Mary Pilant local?

749
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:29,842
No, she's a Canadian. Barney brought her
in here to sort of dress up the place...

750
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:31,927
and she stayed on to manage it for him.

751
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:34,117
Looks like she's
done all right.

752
00:49:34,118 --> 00:49:36,223
Better than all right.
She's in for the estate.

753
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:39,977
Oh? She doesn't look like
a bad sort, does she?

754
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:43,730
- Hmm? Where?
- What do you mean, where?

755
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:47,109
- The pretty one with the menus.
- This girl right here?

756
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:55,450
Uh, Miss Pilant, may I introduce myself?

757
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:57,911
I'm Paul Biegler,
attorney for Lieutenant Manion.

758
00:49:57,996 --> 00:50:00,080
This is Mrs. Rutledge
and Mr. McCarthy, my associates.

759
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:01,666
How do you do?

760
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:03,167
I wonder if you could
sit with us for a minute?

761
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:05,752
- Yes, I can take a minute.
- Thank you.

762
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:10,674
I'd like to ask you a few things,
if you don't mind.

763
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:13,093
What sort of things, Mr. Biegler?

764
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:16,722
Well, like what kind of a man
your employer was, Mr. Quill.

765
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:18,348
A very nice man.

766
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:22,186
If that's true, how do you explain what
happened with Lieutenant Manion's wife?

767
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,272
I don't know what happened
with Lieutenant Manion's wife...

768
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,983
so there really isn't anything
for me to explain, is there?

769
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:31,278
Your loyalty to the dead Mr. Quill
is very touching, Miss Pilant.

770
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,947
Barney was well liked here
by everyone, Mr. Biegler.

771
00:50:34,032 --> 00:50:36,284
It was very generous of
everyone to overlook his

772
00:50:36,285 --> 00:50:38,535
little faults, like
raping other men's wives.

773
00:50:39,913 --> 00:50:41,830
If you'll pardon me...

774
00:50:41,915 --> 00:50:44,625
the waitress will take your order
when you're ready.

775
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:49,254
Nice to have met you, Mr. Biegler,
Mr. McCarthy, Mrs. Rutledge.

776
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:54,218
You've just been ginned, Lieutenant.

777
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:58,388
- Ten, twenty...
- [Sulo] Manion.

778
00:51:02,602 --> 00:51:04,645
- Any word, Lieutenant?
- Yeah.

779
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:07,606
Uh, this. From Washington.

780
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,609
They'll let a doctor come to testify,
but there's a string on it.

781
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:14,446
They want me to go to an army hospital
in Detroit for an examination.

782
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:18,492
Doesn't the army understand you're in jail
on a non-bailable offense?

783
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,494
That's it, as far as the army's concerned.

784
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:23,580
I don't know how I can get around this.
I'll try and think of something.

785
00:51:23,665 --> 00:51:25,312
Look. My wife hasn't
been here for two days.

786
00:51:25,313 --> 00:51:26,959
Have you seen her?

787
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:29,753
- No, not for a while.
- Where the hell is she?

788
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:32,047
You've got other things
to worry about, Lieutenant.

789
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:35,050
Now, I'll get in touch with your wife.
I'll tell her you miss her.

790
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,094
Yeah. You tell her that.

791
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:40,889
- Thanks, Sulo.
- Okay, Polly.

792
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:47,187
I know just how you feel, Lieutenant.

793
00:51:47,272 --> 00:51:51,191
I'd be tearin' my hair out too
if I had something like that outside.

794
00:51:52,277 --> 00:51:56,863
- Something like what outside?
- Man, you know what I mean.

795
00:51:56,948 --> 00:52:00,242
Something like that,
running around on the loose.

796
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:03,704
[Shouts, Groans]

797
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,125
Now, what's the big noise, buckoes?

798
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,171
It's me, dummy.
I hit my elbow on this lousy iron bar.

799
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:16,383
Oh. You want some rubbing alcohol, maybe?

800
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:19,136
Nah. But a little bourbon might help.

801
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:23,557
- [Men Laugh]
- Knock it off. Knock it off, buckoes.

802
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:25,642
Let's finish the game, Lieutenant.

803
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:30,147
## [Jazz]

804
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,459
## [Continues]

805
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:58,842
Oh! Hey!
What a crazy lawyer we've got.

806
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:02,220
Hiya, Polly.
That's what they call you, isn't it? Polly?

807
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:05,474
That's a crazy name for a crazy lawyer!

808
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:15,776
Thanks for letting me sit in, Pie-Eye.

809
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,278
- Hey, you're not splittin' the scene, man?
- Huh?

810
00:53:18,363 --> 00:53:21,156
- I mean, you're not cuttin' out?
- No, I'll be back.

811
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,345
Well, hi, Polly.
Fellas, this is Manny's lawyer.

812
00:53:42,346 --> 00:53:43,804
Hi.

813
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,597
- How are ya?
- Sit down, won't you?

814
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:50,310
Sorry, I can't right now. Mrs. Manion,
may I talk to you for a moment, outside?

815
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:53,980
"Mrs. Manion"? I thought
we dropped the formalities a long time ago.

816
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:55,441
I think maybe we'd better
pick them up again.

817
00:53:55,442 --> 00:53:56,817
This is important.

818
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:59,403
- All right. I'll go with you.
- All right, come on.

819
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:03,198
- Hey! You're coming back, aren't you?
- Sure. What do you think?

820
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:16,711
- See ya later, Pie-Eye.
- Okay.

821
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:27,806
- Did you get my phone message?
- Yeah, but I got busy.

822
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,808
Why haven't you been to see your husband?

823
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:32,060
I don't see why I have
to see him every day.

824
00:54:32,145 --> 00:54:34,396
I think it'd be a very
good idea if you did.

825
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,731
All right. I'll see him every day. Okay?

826
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:38,942
No, not okay. Now, where's your car?

827
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,298
I came with them.

828
00:54:40,299 --> 00:54:41,570
All right.
Mine's right over here. Come on.

829
00:54:41,654 --> 00:54:43,572
Hey, wait a second!
I've got friends inside.

830
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:46,491
- Friends or no friends, you're goin' home.
- Who do you think you are?

831
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:49,369
I'm the lawyer trying to beat a rap
for your husband! Do you remember?

832
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:52,456
- What's that got to do with...
- Wait. Now, you listen. You listen.

833
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,459
Now, until this trial is over, you're
gonna be a meek little housewife...

834
00:54:55,543 --> 00:55:00,130
with horn-rimmed spectacles, and you're
gonna stay away from men and juke joints...

835
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:02,549
and booze and pinball machines...

836
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,260
and you're gonna wear
a skirt and low-heeled shoes...

837
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:08,180
and you're gonna wear a girdle...
and especially a girdle.

838
00:55:08,264 --> 00:55:10,579
Look, Laura, believe
me, I don't usually

839
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,893
complain of an attractive
jiggle, but just...

840
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:16,855
You save that jiggle for your husband to
look at, if and when I get him out of jail.

841
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:18,857
Now come on. Let's go.

842
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:22,277
I'm sorry. I really am.

843
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:24,529
I wouldn't hurt Manny's
chances for anything.

844
00:55:24,614 --> 00:55:26,531
Come on. Come on.

845
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:06,947
Is this about where
Barney knocked you down?

846
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:09,241
Yeah. Right over here.

847
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:11,243
Over there is the opening in the fence...

848
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:13,787
where Muffy was running
back and forth with the flashlight.

849
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:18,542
Where's your trailer?

850
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,086
Up there on the hill.

851
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,843
This is my favorite place.

852
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:37,769
Sometimes when Manny was sleeping,
I'd come out here and just sit.

853
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:39,730
I had to get out
of that trailer.

854
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:41,606
I couldn't stand being
cooped up all the time.

855
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,987
I'm... I'm lonely, Paul.

856
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:49,114
I'm awful lonely.

857
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:52,867
I wouldn't have gone to that roadhouse
if it weren't for that, you know.

858
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:56,246
Maybe you're getting in
some good practice being lonely.

859
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:59,249
You mean you think
maybe Manny won't get off?

860
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:02,544
That'll be up to the jury,
and you can never tell about them.

861
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:05,171
If he didn't, it'd be one way to end it.

862
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:09,092
No. I don't mean that.
I... I may think it sometimes...

863
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:11,553
but I don't really want it.

864
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,108
[Muff Barks]

865
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:28,403
Hello, sweetie. Did ya miss me?

866
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:30,447
Of course you missed me.

867
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,201
You wanna come in, Paul?

868
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:37,621
You can if you want to, you know.

869
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:41,291
No, thank you, Laura.

870
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:45,337
I'm sorry I had to spoil
your fun over at that place. I...

871
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:50,300
- Good night, Laura.
- Good night.

872
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:20,121
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

873
00:58:20,206 --> 00:58:25,126
The Circuit Court for the County
of Iron Cliffs is now in session.

874
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:27,170
You can be seated.

875
00:58:32,635 --> 00:58:36,513
For those of you I haven't met,
my name is Weaver.

876
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:38,932
I'm from downstate,
and I'm sitting

877
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:41,267
temporarily while your
good Judge Maitland...

878
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:43,937
is recovering from a severe illness.

879
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:47,315
There's no need, I think,
to dwell at length upon my methods.

880
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,026
One judge is quite like another.

881
00:58:50,111 --> 00:58:53,947
The only differences may be in the state
of their digestions...

882
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:57,409
or their proclivities
for sleeping on the bench.

883
00:58:57,493 --> 00:59:00,870
For myself, I can digest pig iron.

884
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:03,415
And while I might appear
to doze occasionally,

885
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:05,875
you'll find that I'm
easily awakened...

886
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:11,256
particularly if shaken gently
by a good lawyer with a nice point of law.

887
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:16,761
We will now take up the criminal docket.
Case number one.

888
00:59:16,846 --> 00:59:19,931
The People versus Clarence Madigan.

889
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,809
Breaking and entering in the nighttime.

890
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,979
Will the defendant rise and come forward?

891
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,022
That's me, Your Honor.

892
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,366
"State of Michigan, Court of Iron Cliffs.

893
00:59:38,451 --> 00:59:40,493
I, Mitchell Lodwick,
prosecuting attorney...

894
00:59:40,578 --> 00:59:43,538
come into said county of Iron Cliffs
and give the court to understand...

895
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:45,540
that one Clarence Madigan...

896
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:49,169
alias 'One-Shot' Madigan,
alias 'Smoky' Madigan...

897
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,337
did break and enter
the dwelling house of Casper Katz...

898
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:54,340
and did there commit the felony
of larceny on said premises."

899
00:59:55,426 --> 00:59:58,428
Does Mr. Madigan have an attorney?

900
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:02,307
Oh, no. A man's gotta have money
to ask them fellas the time of day.

901
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:04,934
Mr. Madigan, if you're impoverished,
it's my duty...

902
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:07,520
to appoint an attorney on your behalf.

903
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:11,191
Oh, I wouldn't bother, Your Honor.
I stole the whiskey.

904
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:13,151
I'm guilty as hell.

905
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,528
It was a full case of expensive bourbon,
Your Honor.

906
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:18,865
- Did you sell this whiskey?
- Oh, no. I drank it.

907
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,742
- All of it?
- You bet, Judge.

908
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:24,162
Are you aware that it will be necessary
to punish you for this crime?

909
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:26,206
It was worth it, Your Honor.

910
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,375
Well, I'll accept your plea
of guilty, Mr. Madigan.

911
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:30,460
You'll be sentenced later.

912
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:33,838
- You may now return to your place.
- Thanks, Your Honor.

913
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:40,720
Case number two.
The People versus Frederick Manion.

914
01:00:40,805 --> 01:00:42,972
The charge: murder.

915
01:00:43,057 --> 01:00:47,685
Paul Biegler for the defendant.
My formal appearance is already on file.

916
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:50,563
Which of these men is your client,
Mr. Biegler?

917
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:52,982
- None of them, Your Honor.
- Mr. Sheriff...

918
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:55,443
will you produce the prisoner?

919
01:00:55,528 --> 01:00:59,072
Well, I... I'm afraid I can't do that,
Your Honor.

920
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:02,492
Perhaps someone should explain.
I'm not clairvoyant.

921
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:06,830
The defendant is in Detroit being examined
by a psychiatrist, Your Honor.

922
01:01:06,914 --> 01:01:08,873
Shouldn't the court have been consulted...

923
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:11,918
before the defendant
was allowed to leave its jurisdiction?

924
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:14,879
Well, Your Honor, we're dealing
with the army in this matter...

925
01:01:14,964 --> 01:01:18,258
and this was the only crack the army would
give us at one of their psychiatrists.

926
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:20,426
The court was not present,
and it was very urgent...

927
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:23,096
that we get the defendant
to the psychiatrist.

928
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,515
What does the attorney
for the People say to this?

929
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,350
It was done with my knowledge, Your Honor.

930
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:32,438
I've always heard that this Upper Peninsula
of our fair state was a queer place.

931
01:01:32,523 --> 01:01:34,983
If it's customary here to
allow a man charged with

932
01:01:34,984 --> 01:01:37,443
first-degree murder to
wander about at will...

933
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:41,197
I don't suppose it behooves
an outsider to point out...

934
01:01:41,282 --> 01:01:45,326
that the law makes no provision
for such quaint liberalism.

935
01:01:45,411 --> 01:01:47,809
Your Honor, the defendant
is in the care of a

936
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:50,206
deputy and will be
returned this afternoon.

937
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:53,960
We'll formally arraign
the defendant on his return.

938
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:57,463
For the sake of the docket,
can you give me a clue as to his plea?

939
01:01:57,548 --> 01:02:00,758
The defendant will waive reading
of the information and stand mute.

940
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:03,303
A plea of not guilty will be entered.

941
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:08,141
The case of Frederick Manion
will be placed first on the trial docket.

942
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:21,029
Can you hurry it up, Polly?
Somebody tells that judge...

943
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:22,969
the prisoner was
lounging around the rail

944
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:24,824
road station, he'll
really give me the works.

945
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:26,701
- Just take a minute, Sheriff.
- Okay.

946
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:29,037
Thank you. Come on over here.

947
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:34,709
Well, Lieutenant, how'd things turn out?

948
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:37,170
- I was temporarily insane.
- Did he tell you that?

949
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:40,465
Yeah. Said he's gonna write you a letter...

950
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:43,343
but, uh, I took some notes on my own.

951
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:45,803
- Doctor's name is Smith.
- Smith.

952
01:02:45,888 --> 01:02:50,183
Anatole Ludwig Smith
or, uh, Ludwig von Smith, I hope.

953
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:53,436
- A name like that would impress the jury.
- No, just plain Matthew Smith.

954
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:58,441
He said that when I shot Quill, I was
suffering from "dissociative reaction."

955
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:02,445
Dissociative reaction.
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it, Parn?

956
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:05,323
- Yeah. What does it mean in plain English?
- Well, it means I had...

957
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:08,576
"an irresistible impulse to shoot Quill."

958
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:12,956
That's okay, isn't it?

959
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,375
Yeah, but what did he say
about your knowing the difference...

960
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:17,543
between right and wrong
when you shot Quill?

961
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:20,421
I don't think he said anything.
Why? Is that important?

962
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:24,133
We better not keep the sheriff waiting.
You better go.

963
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:32,475
[McCarthy] Thank you, Sheriff.

964
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:47,907
You ever heard of a Michigan court
accepting irresistible impulse as insanity?

965
01:03:47,992 --> 01:03:51,244
No. Maybe we better switch to self-defense.

966
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:53,663
Even Mitch Lodwick would make
a monkey out of us on that.

967
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:56,416
[Belches] Damn strawberry soda.

968
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,835
- Here. Want a peanut?
- No, thanks.

969
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:01,796
Well, tomorrow's Saturday.

970
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,382
We just have the weekend before the trial.

971
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:08,678
- When do you want to start working?
- Tomorrow morning, early.

972
01:04:12,266 --> 01:04:14,434
[Bell Tolling]

973
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:47,967
[Clatter]

974
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:06,402
- Polly!
- Hey, listen to this, Parn.

975
01:05:06,487 --> 01:05:09,238
Never mind that. Just find...

976
01:05:09,865 --> 01:05:15,161
People versus Durfee,
62 Michigan, 486. Year 1886.

977
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,497
Yeah, that's it.
I have it right here in the A.L.R.

978
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:21,584
Listen. "The right-and-wrong test,
though condemned as being unscientific...

979
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:23,628
is adhered to by most
of the states, but"...

980
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:28,007
Listen to this "but." "But the fact
that one accused of committing a crime...

981
01:05:28,092 --> 01:05:33,012
may have been able to comprehend the
nature and the consequences of this act...

982
01:05:33,097 --> 01:05:36,390
and to know that it was
wrong, nevertheless"...

983
01:05:36,475 --> 01:05:39,352
Dear, sweet, endearing
word, "nevertheless"!

984
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:44,857
"Nevertheless, if he was forced
to its execution by an impulse...

985
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:47,985
by an impulse which he was
powerless to control...

986
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:50,696
he will be excused from punishment."

987
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:54,408
Why, the Michigan Supreme Court
did accept irresistible impulse, Parn.

988
01:05:54,493 --> 01:05:56,516
This is precedent.

989
01:05:56,517 --> 01:05:58,538
Boy, I think we got ahold
of something here.

990
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:01,207
Good old Durfee, 1886.

991
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,417
How about that? Give me a pad.

992
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:05,941
By the saints, this
strawberry soda pop is

993
01:06:05,942 --> 01:06:07,880
beginning to taste like
real bourbon whiskey.

994
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:11,551
Well, don't get drunk yet.
You know, we've got to convince a jury...

995
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:14,637
that our client was irresistibly impulsed.

996
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,305
Remember that.

997
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:19,934
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

998
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:23,729
before we proceed further, it will be
necessary for me to examine you...

999
01:06:23,814 --> 01:06:27,650
on your qualifications to sit as jurors.

1000
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:30,319
Will you please remember
that you are under oath?

1001
01:06:30,404 --> 01:06:32,947
Are all of you citizens?

1002
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:35,700
Will you please raise
your hand if you are not.

1003
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:53,551
Are there any justices of the peace
or law enforcement officers among you?

1004
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:55,803
[Jury] No.

1005
01:06:55,888 --> 01:07:00,808
Are any of you related by blood or marriage
to any law enforcement officer?

1006
01:07:00,893 --> 01:07:03,769
- [Jury] No.
- So much for qualifications.

1007
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:06,606
I will now examine for cause.

1008
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,817
Do any of you have any
business pending with

1009
01:07:08,818 --> 01:07:10,943
the prosecuting attorney,
Mitchell Lodwick?

1010
01:07:11,028 --> 01:07:12,904
[Jury] No.

1011
01:07:12,988 --> 01:07:15,615
Do any of you have any
business pending with

1012
01:07:15,616 --> 01:07:18,242
Paul Biegler, attorney
for the defense?

1013
01:07:18,327 --> 01:07:19,619
No.

1014
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:22,079
Are any of you acquainted
with the defendant...

1015
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:24,749
sitting there on Mr. Biegler's left?

1016
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:27,627
- [Jury] No.
- Will Mrs. Laura Manion...

1017
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:29,921
the defendant's wife please stand?

1018
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:34,467
- Do any of you know Mrs. Manion?
- No.

1019
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:37,261
Thank you, Mrs. Manion.
You may be seated.

1020
01:07:38,305 --> 01:07:40,640
Counsel may challenge the jury for cause.

1021
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:46,270
Your Honor, before counsel's challenge, may
I introduce Mr. Claude Dancer to the court?

1022
01:07:46,355 --> 01:07:49,440
Mr. Dancer is an assistant attorney general
from Lansing.

1023
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:51,609
Because of the peculiar
nature of this case,

1024
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,694
I have requested the
attorney general...

1025
01:07:53,779 --> 01:07:56,239
to allow Mr. Dancer to sit in
with the prosecution.

1026
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:58,950
Your reputation precedes you, Mr. Dancer.

1027
01:07:59,034 --> 01:08:01,327
It's a privilege to have you in my court.

1028
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:04,330
Thank you, Your Honor.
I'm sure it will be instructive.

1029
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:07,083
Do any of you jurors
have any business pending...

1030
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:09,168
before the attorney general's office?

1031
01:08:09,253 --> 01:08:10,753
No.

1032
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:14,757
I must apologize for my
disparaging remarks...

1033
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,635
about the Upper Peninsula and its customs.

1034
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:22,890
I've seldom seen a murder jury
selected and sworn in less than half a day.

1035
01:08:22,975 --> 01:08:26,185
You have won my heart
completely, gentlemen.

1036
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:29,689
Now, Mr. Dancer, you asked for the recess.
What's your problem?

1037
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:32,608
There was a little suggestion
I wanted to make, Your Honor.

1038
01:08:32,693 --> 01:08:36,362
- By all means.
- Since the defense plea is insanity...

1039
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,698
the prosecution has
retained a psychiatrist.

1040
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:41,659
Under the statute, we have the right
to petition for a mental examination...

1041
01:08:41,743 --> 01:08:43,828
of the defendant by our own doctor.

1042
01:08:43,912 --> 01:08:45,955
Are you familiar with that statute,
Mr. Biegler?

1043
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:48,207
Uh-huh. Moderately.

1044
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:50,793
I think it would only
delay things to file a formal petition...

1045
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:53,212
so why don't we just, uh,
get together and sort of...

1046
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:55,298
informally agree to ask His Honor
for an adjournment?

1047
01:08:55,382 --> 01:08:58,259
Only a day or so, and our doctor
can visit with the defendant.

1048
01:08:58,343 --> 01:08:59,844
I think it would save everyone
a great deal of time.

1049
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:01,345
Don't you, Mr. Biegler?

1050
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:03,389
- Yes, I'm sure it will.
- Good.

1051
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:08,227
But suppose you just go ahead
and file that formal petition anyway.

1052
01:09:08,312 --> 01:09:10,313
Of course, you're a little late, aren't ya?

1053
01:09:10,397 --> 01:09:12,315
Well, maybe His Honor will overlook that.

1054
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,483
And then, I'd sort of
like the jury to see...

1055
01:09:14,568 --> 01:09:17,194
that you think our insanity plea
has some merit.

1056
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,739
There really won't be any need for
our doctor to examine your client.

1057
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:21,741
Naturally, I was only following
the usual procedure.

1058
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:23,743
- Well, naturally, I'm all for it.
- Uh-huh.

1059
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:26,370
Do you wish to file the petition or not,
Mr. Dancer?

1060
01:09:26,455 --> 01:09:28,205
- Yes, Your Honor...
- It won't be necessary.

1061
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:29,999
That's right. It won't be necessary at all.

1062
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:33,878
Skirmish over.
Shall we join now on the field of battle?

1063
01:09:37,758 --> 01:09:42,011
The body of Quill had sustained
five gunshot wounds.

1064
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:45,014
One of the bullets
had passed through the heart.

1065
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:48,768
Death, in my opinion,
was almost instantaneous...

1066
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:50,770
and was directly caused by this wound.

1067
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:52,877
Dr. Raschid, may I have
your detailed report?

1068
01:09:52,878 --> 01:09:54,899
Certainly.

1069
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:59,028
I ask that this report be marked
People's Exhibit One for identification.

1070
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:01,322
So received and marked.

1071
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:04,033
The People hand the defense
a copy of the report.

1072
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:06,619
Counsel may cross-examine.

1073
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:11,624
Dr. Raschid, your primary purpose was to
ascertain the cause of death, was it not?

1074
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:12,833
Yes.

1075
01:10:12,918 --> 01:10:15,961
And yet, I read in your report here,
that you checked...

1076
01:10:16,046 --> 01:10:18,506
to determine whether
spermatogenesis was occurring...

1077
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:20,966
in the body of the deceased
at the time of death.

1078
01:10:21,051 --> 01:10:25,888
Objection, Your Honor. The People call this
witness only to show the cause of death.

1079
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:28,599
Your Honor, the entire report
was offered as evidence...

1080
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:31,727
and the report contains this information
about spermatogenesis.

1081
01:10:31,812 --> 01:10:35,022
Overruled, Mr. Lodwick.
The witness may answer.

1082
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:38,651
Yes, I made that examination
on the deceased.

1083
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:41,737
Now, would you tell the
court your findings?

1084
01:10:41,822 --> 01:10:44,782
Spermatogenesis was occurring
at the time of death.

1085
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:49,370
In other words, the deceased, in life,
was not sterile. He could produce children.

1086
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:51,414
- That is correct.
- Now, Doctor...

1087
01:10:51,498 --> 01:10:55,835
if a woman says that she has had
intercourse with a certain man...

1088
01:10:55,919 --> 01:11:00,005
and the man is proved fertile, even though
no evidence is found in the woman's body...

1089
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:02,383
could a lawyer...
say a prosecuting attorney...

1090
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:06,011
could he use this as evidence
that the woman is lying?

1091
01:11:06,096 --> 01:11:10,766
Your Honor.
I, uh, object to this line of questioning.

1092
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:12,935
We're not concerned here
with whether or not...

1093
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:15,438
there have been relations
between a man and a woman.

1094
01:11:15,522 --> 01:11:18,858
Your Honor, as long as an examination
for spermatogenesis has been made...

1095
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:20,693
at least we're entitled to know why.

1096
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,528
Overruled. You may answer.

1097
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:25,573
Yes. Prosecution could use that...

1098
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:29,201
though it certainly
would not be conclusive that she was lying.

1099
01:11:29,286 --> 01:11:31,954
- Why not?
- There could be several reasons...

1100
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:33,956
why the test on her was negative.

1101
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,084
The, uh, use of a contraceptive...

1102
01:11:37,169 --> 01:11:40,963
or... or possibly there was no completion
on the part of the man.

1103
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,883
Now, on this postmortem were you also asked
to determine whether or not...

1104
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:48,137
the deceased had reached
a sexual climax shortly before his death?

1105
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:50,764
- No, sir.
- Could you have made such a determination?

1106
01:11:50,849 --> 01:11:52,349
Oh, yes.

1107
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:55,144
So you were only asked
to make such examination...

1108
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:58,230
as might be useful to the prosecution,
none that might help the defense?

1109
01:11:58,315 --> 01:12:02,359
I object, Your Honor.
The question is argumentative.

1110
01:12:02,444 --> 01:12:04,987
Counsel for the defense
is trying to impugn the intent...

1111
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:06,989
of the representatives of the People.

1112
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:10,242
Mr. Biegler, you must be aware
that the question is improper.

1113
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:12,912
I withdraw the question, Your Honor,
and apologize.

1114
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:15,414
The question and answer will be stricken...

1115
01:12:15,499 --> 01:12:19,084
and the jury will disregard
both the question and the answer.

1116
01:12:20,045 --> 01:12:22,755
- That's all the questions I had.
- No redirect.

1117
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:26,091
The People now call Lloyd Burke.

1118
01:12:26,176 --> 01:12:28,802
[Bailiff]
Will the witness step forward, please.

1119
01:12:32,349 --> 01:12:36,185
[Whispering] How can a jury disregard
what it's already heard?

1120
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:40,773
They can't, Lieutenant. They can't.

1121
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:44,276
...The whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1122
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:46,445
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

1123
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,615
Will you state your profession,
please, Mr. Burke?

1124
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:53,869
- I'm a commercial photographer.
- Were you called upon by the police...

1125
01:12:53,954 --> 01:12:57,790
to take photographs of the body
of the deceased Bernard Quill...

1126
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,751
before and after he was removed
from the scene of death?

1127
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:02,002
Yes, sir, I was.

1128
01:13:02,087 --> 01:13:04,838
Were these photographs
of the deceased made by you?

1129
01:13:09,386 --> 01:13:11,387
They were.

1130
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:13,389
The reporter will please mark
these photographs...

1131
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:16,392
People's Exhibit 2A to
2D for identification.

1132
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:19,853
Photographs are tendered
to the defense for examination...

1133
01:13:19,938 --> 01:13:22,147
and the People move
their admission as evidence.

1134
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:24,984
- Your witness.
- Uh, no questions. No objections.

1135
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:27,444
Paul, he took pictures
of me that night too.

1136
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:29,863
Just a minute, Mr. Burke.

1137
01:13:29,948 --> 01:13:33,075
Uh, Mr. Burke...

1138
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:35,160
these photographs offered as evidence...

1139
01:13:35,245 --> 01:13:37,913
are they the only photographs
you took that night?

1140
01:13:37,998 --> 01:13:39,999
Why, uh, no.

1141
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:42,251
I suppose the others didn't turn out.
ls that it?

1142
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:45,087
All my pictures turn out!

1143
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:48,048
- [Spectators Laugh]
- Oh, of course. I... I beg your pardon.

1144
01:13:48,133 --> 01:13:50,843
Did you give the other
pictures to the police?

1145
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,846
- Yes, sir, I did.
- Well, Mr. Burke, what were they?

1146
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:57,600
Were they side shots,
or a shot of the moon, perhaps?

1147
01:13:57,684 --> 01:13:59,164
Or a black bear scavenging
the Thunder Bay dump?

1148
01:13:59,165 --> 01:14:00,644
[Spectators Laugh]

1149
01:14:00,729 --> 01:14:02,647
Your Honor, I object!

1150
01:14:02,648 --> 01:14:04,565
I can't see how other
photographs are relevant.

1151
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:06,567
The photographs in evidence
were introduced...

1152
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:09,361
to show that the deceased
met with a violent death.

1153
01:14:09,446 --> 01:14:11,218
Well, Your Honor, I should
think any photograph

1154
01:14:11,219 --> 01:14:12,990
pertaining to the case
would be relevant.

1155
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:15,951
The point is good, Mr. Biegler. Continue.

1156
01:14:16,036 --> 01:14:18,829
What were these other
photographs of, Mr. Burke?

1157
01:14:19,623 --> 01:14:21,332
Lieutenant Manion's wife.

1158
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:23,397
You mean these photographs
showed how she looked

1159
01:14:23,398 --> 01:14:25,377
that night after Barney
Quill was killed?

1160
01:14:25,462 --> 01:14:28,547
- Yes.
- Your Honor, how she looked is irrelevant.

1161
01:14:28,632 --> 01:14:30,425
No evidence has been
introduced to connect Mrs.

1162
01:14:30,426 --> 01:14:32,217
Manion's appearance to
a charge of murder.

1163
01:14:32,302 --> 01:14:34,428
- [Judge Weaver] Sustained.
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

1164
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:37,765
I just wanted to make sure the prosecution
wasn't withholding evidence.

1165
01:14:37,849 --> 01:14:39,767
Now look here!

1166
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:42,895
I protest to the defense attorney's
persistent attacks...

1167
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,397
on the motives of the prosecution.

1168
01:14:45,482 --> 01:14:50,152
The jury will disregard the remark
made by the attorney for the defense.

1169
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:54,573
There's no reason to believe that the
prosecution has not acted in good faith.

1170
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:57,701
My apologies to the prosecution,
and to the court.

1171
01:14:57,786 --> 01:15:01,497
But, Your Honor,
as long as protests are being made...

1172
01:15:01,581 --> 01:15:03,749
I'd like to make a protest myself.

1173
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:09,088
Now, I'm perfectly willing to take on
these two legal giants anytime, anyplace...

1174
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:12,049
but in all fairness,
it ought to be one at a time.

1175
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:15,761
I don't want these two fellows pitching
knuckleballs at me at the same time.

1176
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:19,098
It seems to me you're batting
close to a thousand, Mr. Biegler...

1177
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:21,809
but your point is well taken.

1178
01:15:21,893 --> 01:15:24,436
Whichever attorney opens
with the witness...

1179
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:29,191
he alone shall continue with that witness
until the witness is excused.

1180
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:31,402
Thank you, Your Honor. No more questions.

1181
01:15:31,486 --> 01:15:33,404
No questions.

1182
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:46,959
- My, we're drawing well, aren't we?
- Where's Parnell?

1183
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:49,086
Parnell? Why? Isn't he here?

1184
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:52,297
No, he's not here. He's not in his rooming
house, and he hasn't been there all night.

1185
01:15:52,382 --> 01:15:54,299
You were the last to see him. Where is he?

1186
01:15:54,384 --> 01:15:56,301
I promised not to tell, so don't ask me.

1187
01:15:56,386 --> 01:16:00,055
- Aw, he hasn't fallen off the wagon?
- No. He was sober.

1188
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:02,058
Has he gone somewhere?

1189
01:16:02,059 --> 01:16:03,976
He did borrow my car
for something or other.

1190
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:07,062
Your car? That was smart.
He hasn't driven a car in 20 years.

1191
01:16:07,147 --> 01:16:09,189
He'll kill himself. Now where's he gone?

1192
01:16:09,274 --> 01:16:11,316
My word is my bond.

1193
01:16:18,742 --> 01:16:21,201
## [Humming]

1194
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:38,552
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

1195
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:40,512
- [Jury] Good morning.
- You may proceed.

1196
01:16:40,597 --> 01:16:43,182
Your Honor, the, uh...

1197
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:47,019
the defense notices a third person
at the prosecution's table.

1198
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:50,314
We were wondering if the court
shares our curiosity as to just who he is.

1199
01:16:50,398 --> 01:16:52,316
I was about to introduce him.

1200
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,320
Your Honor, this gentleman
is Dr. W. Gregory Harcourt.

1201
01:16:56,404 --> 01:17:00,365
Dr. Harcourt is the People's psychiatrist
in this case.

1202
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:05,037
We ask that Dr. Harcourt be allowed
to sit at our table as an observer.

1203
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:07,831
What are you gonna have him observe?
The constellation of Taurus...

1204
01:17:07,916 --> 01:17:10,292
- or the life and times of a bumblebee?
- [Laughter]

1205
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:12,294
To observe the defendant, of course.

1206
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:14,630
Oh! Oh, well, that's fine. That's fine.

1207
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:18,509
The defense has no objection, Your Honor.
I just wish to express my relief...

1208
01:17:18,593 --> 01:17:23,889
that the new recruit is not additional
legal reinforcements from Lansing.

1209
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,308
- [Spectators Chuckle]
- [Lodwick] Call Alphonse Paquette.

1210
01:17:32,482 --> 01:17:34,441
Raise your right hand, please.

1211
01:17:34,526 --> 01:17:37,069
You do solemnly swear that the testimony
you shall give in this cause...

1212
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:40,906
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1213
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,908
- [Paquette] I do.
- Take a seat, please.

1214
01:17:45,662 --> 01:17:49,164
- Will you state your name, please.
- Alphonse Paquette.

1215
01:17:49,249 --> 01:17:51,875
You work at the Thunder Bay Inn,
don't you, Mr. Paquette?

1216
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,418
I'm bartender there.

1217
01:17:53,503 --> 01:17:56,797
Were you working on the night that Barney
Quill was shot by Frederick Manion?

1218
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:59,258
- I was.
- Were you witness to the shooting?

1219
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:00,467
I was.

1220
01:18:00,552 --> 01:18:03,512
Will you tell us in your own words,
please, what happened?

1221
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:07,933
I was at a table by the door
when Lieutenant Manion came in.

1222
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:10,310
Did you know Lieutenant Manion
by sight and by name?

1223
01:18:10,395 --> 01:18:12,855
- Yes, sir.
- Go ahead.

1224
01:18:12,939 --> 01:18:15,274
Well, he came in
and walked over to the bar...

1225
01:18:15,358 --> 01:18:17,693
and began to shoot.

1226
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:21,029
He shot Barney when he came up to the bar,
and when Barney fell...

1227
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:24,032
he kept on shooting down at Barney,
behind the bar.

1228
01:18:24,117 --> 01:18:26,034
Then he turned around and walked out.

1229
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:30,414
When Lieutenant Manion entered the bar,
how did he appear to you?

1230
01:18:30,498 --> 01:18:33,000
Well, he walked slow.

1231
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:35,335
Kind of deliberate, I guess you could say.

1232
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:38,797
- Did he speak to Barney Quill?
- Not a word.

1233
01:18:38,882 --> 01:18:42,384
Just walked over and pulled out
his gun, and bang.

1234
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:45,637
- And then he walked out.
- Yes.

1235
01:18:45,722 --> 01:18:48,932
When he walked out, how
did he appear to you?

1236
01:18:49,017 --> 01:18:51,518
He seemed just like he
did when he walked in.

1237
01:18:51,603 --> 01:18:53,812
Like he was the mailman
delivering the mail.

1238
01:18:53,897 --> 01:18:57,399
[Lodwick] When Lieutenant Manion
walked out of the bar, what did you do?

1239
01:18:57,483 --> 01:19:00,652
[Paquette] Well, it happened so fast,
I guess I was stunned.

1240
01:19:00,737 --> 01:19:03,655
- But then I ran out after him.
- Did you find him outside?

1241
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:06,491
- Yes, sir. He was walking away.
- Did you speak to him?

1242
01:19:06,576 --> 01:19:10,829
Yes, sir. I said, uh, "Lieutenant,
you'd better not run away from this."

1243
01:19:10,914 --> 01:19:13,332
Did he reply to you?

1244
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:16,877
He said, "Do you want some too, buster?"

1245
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:19,004
Was he pointing the gun at you?

1246
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:22,841
Well, he was holding the gun in my
direction, but the muzzle was low.

1247
01:19:22,926 --> 01:19:26,762
When he said,
"Do you want some too, buster?"

1248
01:19:26,846 --> 01:19:28,764
how was that expressed?

1249
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:31,934
Did he shout it? Was it hysterical?

1250
01:19:32,018 --> 01:19:35,854
- Was he hoarse? Did his voice tremble?
- No, sir.

1251
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:39,191
He just said it cool and hard
and looked right at me.

1252
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:42,361
Did he appear to you,
as far as you could tell...

1253
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:45,614
to be in complete possession
of his faculties?

1254
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:49,159
- Yes, sir, far as I could tell.
- Your witness.

1255
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:51,536
Mr. Paquette, did you see Laura Manion...

1256
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:53,872
the wife of Lieutenant Manion,
in the bar that night?

1257
01:19:53,957 --> 01:19:57,209
Your Honor, there he goes again.
This is immaterial and irrelevant.

1258
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:59,253
Your Honor, I don't see
what the prosecution's

1259
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:01,213
so jumpy about.
I haven't gone anyplace yet.

1260
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:05,008
Well, let's see where he's going
before we start objecting, Mr. Lodwick.

1261
01:20:05,093 --> 01:20:07,219
You may proceed, Mr. Biegler.

1262
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:10,055
Well, did you see Mrs. Manion
in the bar that night?

1263
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:12,099
She was there.

1264
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,059
Did Barney Quill leave
the bar that night?

1265
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:16,561
- Yes.
- Do you remember when he returned?

1266
01:20:16,646 --> 01:20:18,563
I think he came back around midnight.

1267
01:20:18,648 --> 01:20:22,109
From which entrance did he come?
Did he come from the lobby entrance...

1268
01:20:22,193 --> 01:20:24,945
or come from that...
that, uh, outside entrance?

1269
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:27,155
- It was from the lobby.
- Mm-hmm.

1270
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,699
And how did he appear
to you at that time?

1271
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,158
How do you mean?

1272
01:20:30,243 --> 01:20:31,890
You understood the
prosecuting attorney very

1273
01:20:31,891 --> 01:20:33,537
well when he asked
you that question...

1274
01:20:33,621 --> 01:20:35,539
about Lieutenant Manion's appearance.

1275
01:20:35,623 --> 01:20:38,875
Oh, well, he was just
old Barney, like usual.

1276
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:43,213
You mean he was just
good old sober, reliable...

1277
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:45,195
gentle, salt-of-the-earth,
friend-to-man Barney?

1278
01:20:45,196 --> 01:20:47,092
Your Honor! Your Honor!

1279
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,094
Your Honor, what kind
of a question is that?

1280
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,263
I withdraw the question, Your Honor.

1281
01:20:53,099 --> 01:20:55,017
Mr. Paquette...

1282
01:20:55,101 --> 01:20:58,770
had Barney changed his clothes
since he left the bar?

1283
01:20:58,855 --> 01:21:00,063
I don't remember.

1284
01:21:00,148 --> 01:21:03,025
Might his clothing have been different
when he returned?

1285
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:05,861
That is, might he have changed his clothes?

1286
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:07,863
I couldn't say. I didn't notice.

1287
01:21:07,947 --> 01:21:10,115
Was Barney drinking that night?

1288
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:14,619
Well, he... he always had a few shots
while he was talking to the customers.

1289
01:21:14,704 --> 01:21:18,081
- He was friendly.
- Oh, sure he was. Sure. Good old Barney.

1290
01:21:18,166 --> 01:21:21,918
Well, now, how many shots would you say
good old Barney usually had?

1291
01:21:22,003 --> 01:21:23,295
I don't know exactly.

1292
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:26,214
Wasn't he, in fact,
pretty loaded that night, Mr. Paquette?

1293
01:21:26,299 --> 01:21:27,799
Objection, Your Honor.

1294
01:21:27,884 --> 01:21:31,553
Even if the deceased was dead drunk,
it's no defense to this charge.

1295
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:34,931
Sustained.
I suggest you get off this, Mr. Biegler.

1296
01:21:35,016 --> 01:21:40,604
Mr. Paquette, what would you call a man
with an insatiable penchant for women?

1297
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:43,523
- A what?
- A penchant.

1298
01:21:43,608 --> 01:21:46,151
A desire, uh, taste, passion.

1299
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:49,404
Well, a ladies' man, I guess.

1300
01:21:49,489 --> 01:21:52,074
- Or maybe just a damn fool.
- [Spectators Laugh]

1301
01:21:53,201 --> 01:21:56,286
Just answer the questions, Mr. Paquette.

1302
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,914
The attorneys will provide the wisecracks.

1303
01:21:58,998 --> 01:22:02,918
Well... [Laughs] What else would you call
a man like that, Mr. Paquette?

1304
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:05,170
We can't see the drift of this, Your Honor.

1305
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:07,339
You mean you do see, Mr. Lodwick.

1306
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:09,258
You may answer.

1307
01:22:09,259 --> 01:22:11,093
Can you think of another
name, Mr. Paquette?

1308
01:22:11,803 --> 01:22:13,929
- Woman chaser.
- Try again.

1309
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:17,641
- Masher?
- Oh, now, come now, Mr. Paquette.

1310
01:22:17,725 --> 01:22:20,811
Mashers went out with
whalebone corsets and hairnets.

1311
01:22:20,895 --> 01:22:23,188
- [Spectators Laugh]
- Did you ever hear the expression "wolf"?

1312
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,982
Well, sure, I heard that.
It just slipped my mind.

1313
01:22:26,067 --> 01:22:28,151
It slipped your mind.
Well, naturally it would.

1314
01:22:28,236 --> 01:22:29,737
Clanking around in there with
all those rusty old mashers.

1315
01:22:29,738 --> 01:22:31,238
[Laughing]

1316
01:22:31,364 --> 01:22:35,367
Have you ever known a man who you could
call a wolf, Mr. Paquette? - I'm not sure.

1317
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:38,120
- Was Barney Quill a wolf, Mr. Paquette?
- I couldn't say.

1318
01:22:38,204 --> 01:22:40,038
- Or wouldn't?
- Objection.

1319
01:22:40,123 --> 01:22:44,292
Sustained. The question was answered.
He said he couldn't say.

1320
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:50,215
Mr. Paquette, when Barney returned
from wherever he had gone...

1321
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,551
- did he relieve you at the bar?
- Yes.

1322
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:54,178
And what did he say to
you when he relieved you?

1323
01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:55,720
Said, "I'll take over."

1324
01:22:55,805 --> 01:22:58,265
When you came out from behind the bar,
where did you go?

1325
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:02,144
I went over to the table
where the Pedersons were sitting.

1326
01:23:02,228 --> 01:23:06,064
Now, you testified that you were by the
door when Lieutenant Manion came in.

1327
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:09,234
Is that the reason you were by the door,
because the Pedersons' table was there?

1328
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:10,819
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

1329
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:13,822
And how long was it before
Lieutenant Manion came in?

1330
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:17,826
I don't know exactly.
Uh, maybe 30 minutes.

1331
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:20,453
And you remained
at the Pedersons' table all that time.

1332
01:23:20,538 --> 01:23:24,958
- Yes, they're friends of mine.
- Is there also a window beside that table?

1333
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:26,960
- I think so.
- You think so.

1334
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:30,338
How long have you worked
at the Thunder Bay Inn, Mr. Paquette?

1335
01:23:30,423 --> 01:23:32,383
About six or seven years.

1336
01:23:32,384 --> 01:23:34,342
Well, now, does this
window beside the table...

1337
01:23:34,427 --> 01:23:37,929
does it suddenly vanish
and then reappear...

1338
01:23:38,014 --> 01:23:39,931
and come and go in a ghostly fashion?

1339
01:23:40,016 --> 01:23:41,933
No, sir. It's there all the time.

1340
01:23:42,018 --> 01:23:43,894
And while you were talking
to your friends there,

1341
01:23:43,895 --> 01:23:45,770
did you happen to look
out of the window?

1342
01:23:45,855 --> 01:23:48,023
- I might have.
- And when you looked out of the window...

1343
01:23:48,107 --> 01:23:50,066
were you looking for something special?

1344
01:23:50,151 --> 01:23:52,110
No. No, I wasn't looking for anything.

1345
01:23:52,195 --> 01:23:54,446
Didn't Barney Quill tell you
to go over to that window...

1346
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,656
and watch out for Lieutenant Manion?

1347
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:59,993
[Sighs]

1348
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:02,662
Did he tell you to look out
for Lieutenant Manion?

1349
01:24:03,206 --> 01:24:05,207
He did not.

1350
01:24:06,334 --> 01:24:09,586
Mr. Paquette,
Barney was quite a marksman, wasn't he?

1351
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:12,547
With guns. He'd won a lot of prizes
for shooting, hadn't he?

1352
01:24:12,632 --> 01:24:16,134
- Yes.
- Did he keep any guns behind the bar?

1353
01:24:22,183 --> 01:24:24,100
Well, he might have.

1354
01:24:24,185 --> 01:24:26,145
Isn't it a fact that there
are three concealed

1355
01:24:26,146 --> 01:24:28,104
pistol racks behind the
bar, Mr. Paquette?

1356
01:24:28,189 --> 01:24:31,983
Your Honor, the defendant's plea
is one of insanity, not self-defense.

1357
01:24:32,068 --> 01:24:35,987
I'm sure Mr. Biegler
hasn't forgotten that fact, Mr. Lodwick.

1358
01:24:36,072 --> 01:24:38,115
You may answer.

1359
01:24:38,116 --> 01:24:40,158
Are there concealed gun
racks behind the bar?

1360
01:24:40,243 --> 01:24:41,243
Yes.

1361
01:24:41,327 --> 01:24:44,537
And how many people
know about these gun racks?

1362
01:24:44,622 --> 01:24:46,186
I couldn't say.

1363
01:24:46,187 --> 01:24:47,749
But isn't it a fact that
Barney, every once in a while...

1364
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:50,669
he'd take the guns out of these racks,
and twirling them on his fingers...

1365
01:24:50,753 --> 01:24:53,672
he'd demonstrate his skill to the patrons?

1366
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:55,632
- Isn't it?
- I don't remember.

1367
01:24:55,716 --> 01:24:57,968
Oh, now, come on. Try and remember.

1368
01:24:58,052 --> 01:25:01,805
- Did you ever see him do that yourself?
- Once or twice he did.

1369
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:05,392
- That's all, Mr. Paquette.
- [Lodwick] No further questions.

1370
01:25:05,476 --> 01:25:09,104
- [Judge Weaver] The witness may step down.
- Call George Lemon.

1371
01:25:14,944 --> 01:25:17,612
[Whispering]
Biegler's going off in all directions.

1372
01:25:17,697 --> 01:25:19,614
What's he getting at?

1373
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:22,575
[Bailiff]
Raise your right hand, please.

1374
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,578
I have a feeling he's
afraid of what we'll get at.

1375
01:25:24,579 --> 01:25:26,496
[Bailiff] ...shall
be the truth...

1376
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:29,457
Mr. Biegler's putting up
a smoke screen for some reason.

1377
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:31,793
- I do.
- Take a seat, please.

1378
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:37,257
- Will you state your name, please?
- George Lemon.

1379
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:39,217
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Lemon?

1380
01:25:39,302 --> 01:25:42,554
I'm caretaker of the tourist park
in Thunder Bay.

1381
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:44,556
I see the place is clean and orderly.

1382
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,142
I check people in,
check 'em out and lock the gate at night.

1383
01:25:47,226 --> 01:25:50,520
And what is your authority
for these duties?

1384
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:55,900
I'm paid by Mastodon township, and I'm also
a deputy sheriff... just courtesy, sort of.

1385
01:25:56,569 --> 01:25:59,404
Did you see Lieutenant Manion
on the night of the 15th?

1386
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:02,407
- The night Barney Quill was killed?
- Yes, sir.

1387
01:26:03,284 --> 01:26:05,285
Will you tell the court...

1388
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:10,415
about how and-and when
you saw Lieutenant Manion?

1389
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:13,543
About 1:00 a.m.,
a knock on my door waked me up.

1390
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:16,254
I went to the door,
and Lieutenant Manion was standing there.

1391
01:26:16,339 --> 01:26:21,176
He said, "You better take me, Mr. Lemon,
because I just shot Barney Quill."

1392
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:24,512
I told him to go back to his trailer
and that I would call the state police.

1393
01:26:24,597 --> 01:26:28,433
How did Lieutenant Manion appear to
you when he asked you to take him?

1394
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:30,352
He said what he had to say
and did what I told him.

1395
01:26:30,353 --> 01:26:32,187
There wasn't any fuss.

1396
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:35,357
Did he appear to you to be,
as far as you could tell...

1397
01:26:35,441 --> 01:26:38,109
in complete possession of his faculties?

1398
01:26:38,194 --> 01:26:40,362
As far as I could tell, yes, sir.

1399
01:26:42,031 --> 01:26:43,948
Take the witness.

1400
01:26:44,033 --> 01:26:47,452
Mr. Lemon,
did you go to the Manions' trailer?

1401
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:48,578
Yes, sir.

1402
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:50,580
Did you see Mrs. Manion at the trailer?

1403
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:53,625
- Yes, sir.
- What was her appearance?

1404
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:56,836
- She was a mess.
- [Spectators Laugh]

1405
01:26:56,921 --> 01:26:59,130
Objection.
No evidence has been introduced...

1406
01:26:59,215 --> 01:27:02,133
to make Mrs. Manion's appearance
relevant to this case.

1407
01:27:02,218 --> 01:27:05,762
Well, no evidence has been introduced to
make Barney Quill's appearance relevant...

1408
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:07,931
but you didn't object to the question then.

1409
01:27:08,015 --> 01:27:11,768
Is that because you know that Barney Quill
bathed and changed and cooled off...

1410
01:27:11,852 --> 01:27:14,396
after he raped and beat hell
out of this poor woman?

1411
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:17,857
Your Honor, everybody in this court
is being tried except Frederick Manion!

1412
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,568
I must protest...

1413
01:27:19,569 --> 01:27:21,152
Now listen! This is a
cross-examination in a murder case!

1414
01:27:21,237 --> 01:27:24,239
It's not a high school debate!
What are you and Dancer trying to do?

1415
01:27:24,323 --> 01:27:26,658
Railroad this soldier into the clink?

1416
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:29,411
Mr. Biegler,
you are an experienced attorney...

1417
01:27:29,495 --> 01:27:32,247
and you know better
than to make such an outburst.

1418
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:35,208
I will not tolerate
intemperance of this sort.

1419
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:38,545
If you once again try
the patience of this court...

1420
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:41,047
I shall hold you in contempt.

1421
01:27:42,258 --> 01:27:43,675
Sorry.

1422
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:46,344
Your Honor...

1423
01:27:46,429 --> 01:27:50,014
I apologize,
and it won't happen again.

1424
01:27:50,099 --> 01:27:54,811
The witness's answer will be stricken,
and the jury will disregard the answer.

1425
01:27:55,354 --> 01:27:59,107
- Now you may proceed, Mr. Biegler.
- Yes, sir.

1426
01:27:59,984 --> 01:28:01,943
Mr. Lemon...

1427
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:05,280
on the night when Lieutenant Manion
awakened you and turned himself in...

1428
01:28:05,364 --> 01:28:07,282
had you been awakened before?

1429
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:08,867
Had anything else
disturbed your slumbers?

1430
01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:10,368
No, sir.

1431
01:28:10,453 --> 01:28:14,873
- There were no soldiers singing?
- No, sir. Not in my park after 10:00.

1432
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:17,042
There were no women screaming?

1433
01:28:17,043 --> 01:28:19,127
Well, those screams
were down by the gate.

1434
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:20,837
Objection! Objection!

1435
01:28:20,921 --> 01:28:23,923
I see no reason for objecting yet,
Mr. Lodwick.

1436
01:28:24,008 --> 01:28:27,177
Tell us about those screams, Mr. Lemon.

1437
01:28:27,261 --> 01:28:28,992
I didn't hear 'em myself.

1438
01:28:28,993 --> 01:28:30,722
There were some tourists
from Ohio in the park...

1439
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:33,141
and they heard 'em
and told me about it the next day.

1440
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:37,270
- Now, Mr. Lodwick.
- This testimony is incompetent, hearsay...

1441
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:40,315
irrelevant, immaterial, inconclusive...

1442
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:42,817
- Yeah, well, that's too much for me.
- [Spectators Chuckle]

1443
01:28:42,902 --> 01:28:45,320
- The witness is yours, Mr. Lodwick.
- Huh?

1444
01:28:45,404 --> 01:28:48,156
Oh, uh, uh, no questions.

1445
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:50,867
The witness may step down.

1446
01:28:50,951 --> 01:28:53,661
- Call your next witness.
- Um...

1447
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:57,081
Detective Sergeant James Durgo.

1448
01:28:58,918 --> 01:29:01,169
- Hi, Polly.
- [Whispering] Hi, Jim. Come here.

1449
01:29:03,214 --> 01:29:06,007
As soon as we break,
you'd better phone that army psychiatrist.

1450
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:08,927
- Tell him to be here day after tomorrow.
- Will do.

1451
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:12,263
Will you please tell me
where Parnell has gone?

1452
01:29:12,348 --> 01:29:14,265
Won't do.

1453
01:29:14,350 --> 01:29:15,975
You're fired.

1454
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:19,395
You can't fire me till you pay me.

1455
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:21,773
[Durgo] Detective Sergeant
James Durgo, state police.

1456
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:24,776
[Lodwick] Were you called to Thunder Bay
by Deputy Sheriff Lemon of Thunder Bay...

1457
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:27,195
on the night that Barney Quill
was shot and killed?

1458
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:31,282
Yes, sir, I was. My companion officer and I
were the first to be called in on the case.

1459
01:29:31,367 --> 01:29:34,953
Sergeant Durgo, when you arrived
at the Manion trailer, who was there?

1460
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:37,372
Lieutenant Manion and his wife were there.

1461
01:29:37,456 --> 01:29:39,707
What did Lieutenant Manion say to you?

1462
01:29:40,793 --> 01:29:44,128
He said that his wife
had had some trouble with Barney Quill...

1463
01:29:44,213 --> 01:29:46,923
that he had gone to the tavern
and shot Quill.

1464
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:50,343
He asked us whether Quill was dead or not.
We told him he was.

1465
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:53,429
How did Lieutenant Manion
take this information?

1466
01:29:53,514 --> 01:29:57,183
- He didn't seem surprised.
- What did you do then, Sergeant Durgo?

1467
01:29:57,268 --> 01:29:59,185
I asked for the gun he'd used.

1468
01:29:59,270 --> 01:30:01,334
Did you take Lieutenant
Manion to the county

1469
01:30:01,335 --> 01:30:03,398
jail here in Iron City
on that same night?

1470
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:06,276
Yes, sir. We drove the lieutenant
down with his wife.

1471
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:11,322
On the drive to Iron City, did the
lieutenant talk further about the shooting?

1472
01:30:11,407 --> 01:30:15,159
He remarked that if he had the whole thing
to do over again, he'd still do it.

1473
01:30:15,244 --> 01:30:18,997
[Lodwick] During all this...
at the trailer, the drive to Iron City...

1474
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:20,957
how did Lieutenant Manion appear to you?

1475
01:30:22,209 --> 01:30:25,587
He was very quiet most of the time.
Seemed clearheaded.

1476
01:30:25,671 --> 01:30:27,819
As far as you could tell,
would you say that he

1477
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:29,966
was in complete possession
of his faculties?

1478
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:32,760
- Seemed so to me.
- Your witness.

1479
01:30:32,845 --> 01:30:35,243
Sergeant Durgo, you
testified that Lieutenant

1480
01:30:35,244 --> 01:30:37,640
Manion told you that he
shot Barney Quill...

1481
01:30:37,725 --> 01:30:42,061
after he learned that his wife
had had some trouble with Quill.

1482
01:30:42,146 --> 01:30:45,607
Now, were these the words
Lieutenant Manion used? "Some trouble"?

1483
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:48,026
No, sir. Those were my words, not his.

1484
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:51,029
And was it your notion
to come here and use your own words?

1485
01:30:51,113 --> 01:30:53,031
No, sir. It was not.

1486
01:30:53,115 --> 01:30:55,742
And was the suggestion to
call it "some trouble"

1487
01:30:55,743 --> 01:30:58,369
made by somebody here
in this courtroom?

1488
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,540
Yes, sir, it was.

1489
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:04,876
All right, Sergeant.
Now, would you tell the court...

1490
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,337
what words Lieutenant
Manion actually used...

1491
01:31:07,421 --> 01:31:09,631
to describe the trouble his wife had had?

1492
01:31:09,715 --> 01:31:12,383
Objection, Your Honor.
We've been over this before.

1493
01:31:12,468 --> 01:31:15,553
This information would not be relevant
to any issues before the court.

1494
01:31:15,638 --> 01:31:17,555
This statement concerning some trouble...

1495
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:21,351
was brought out during
the direct examination of Sergeant Durgo.

1496
01:31:21,435 --> 01:31:24,083
Up to now you've
adroitly restricted all

1497
01:31:24,084 --> 01:31:26,731
testimony as far as Laura
Manion's concerned.

1498
01:31:26,815 --> 01:31:30,318
All right. The cat's out of the bag.
It's fair game for me to chase it.

1499
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:33,488
This is a sore point, Mr. Biegler,
and it's getting sorer.

1500
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:35,490
I'd like to hear from the prosecution.

1501
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:38,055
The burden is on the
defense to prove temporary

1502
01:31:38,056 --> 01:31:40,536
insanity at the time
of the shooting.

1503
01:31:40,621 --> 01:31:44,791
Now, if the reason for the alleged insanity
is important to this case...

1504
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:47,418
then that is a matter
for a competent witness...

1505
01:31:47,503 --> 01:31:50,296
an expert on the subject of the human mind.

1506
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:53,841
What the defense is trying to do...

1507
01:31:53,926 --> 01:31:56,761
is introduce some sensational material...

1508
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:59,514
for the purposes of
obscuring the real issues.

1509
01:32:00,974 --> 01:32:05,603
Your Honor, how can the jury accurately
estimate the testimony being given here...

1510
01:32:05,688 --> 01:32:09,148
unless they first know
the reason behind this whole trial...

1511
01:32:09,233 --> 01:32:12,110
why Lieutenant Manion shot Barney Quill.

1512
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:16,280
Now, the prosecution would like to separate
the motive from the act.

1513
01:32:16,365 --> 01:32:21,285
Well, that's like trying to take the core
from an apple without breaking the skin.

1514
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:26,290
The core of our defense is that the
defendant's temporary insanity...

1515
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:29,669
was triggered by
this so-called trouble with Quill.

1516
01:32:29,753 --> 01:32:31,879
And I beg the court...

1517
01:32:31,964 --> 01:32:36,467
I beg the court
to let me cut into the apple.

1518
01:32:38,387 --> 01:32:40,763
Our objection still stands, Your Honor.

1519
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:57,155
Objection overruled.

1520
01:32:57,239 --> 01:32:59,240
[Spectators Murmuring]

1521
01:33:03,704 --> 01:33:07,331
Sergeant Durgo, tell the court...

1522
01:33:07,416 --> 01:33:11,461
how Lieutenant Manion described
the trouble his wife had with Barney Quill.

1523
01:33:11,545 --> 01:33:14,964
He told us that Quill had raped his wife.

1524
01:33:15,048 --> 01:33:19,469
Now, can you recall generally what
Lieutenant Manion told you about this rape?

1525
01:33:20,053 --> 01:33:24,223
Yes, sir. He said he'd been asleep
since right after dinner.

1526
01:33:24,308 --> 01:33:28,394
That he was waked up by some noise.
Screams, he thought.

1527
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:32,064
That he got up, opened the trailer door
and went outside.

1528
01:33:32,608 --> 01:33:35,693
His wife came running
out of the dark and fell into his arms.

1529
01:33:35,778 --> 01:33:39,030
You saw his wife in the trailer.
How'd she look?

1530
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:42,200
She was a little hysterical.
She'd been pretty badly beaten up.

1531
01:33:42,284 --> 01:33:45,077
She had big black bruises
over her face and her arms.

1532
01:33:45,162 --> 01:33:47,080
Did Mrs. Manion tell you
about this rape and beating?

1533
01:33:47,081 --> 01:33:48,998
She did.

1534
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:50,896
And did she take you to the
place where it had happened?

1535
01:33:50,897 --> 01:33:52,668
Yes, sir. The next morning.

1536
01:33:52,753 --> 01:33:54,484
And did you find anything there?

1537
01:33:54,485 --> 01:33:56,214
Any sort of evidence
pertaining to the story...

1538
01:33:56,298 --> 01:33:58,716
that Mrs. Manion had told you?

1539
01:33:58,801 --> 01:34:03,554
On the lane in the woods we found
some tire tracks and some dog tracks...

1540
01:34:03,639 --> 01:34:07,350
and a leather case with some
horn-rimmed glasses inside.

1541
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:10,478
We also looked for...

1542
01:34:10,562 --> 01:34:14,190
a certain undergarment of Mrs. Manion's,
but we didn't find it.

1543
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:17,068
Will the attorneys for both sides
approach the bench, please?

1544
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:25,159
[Whispering] Mr. Biegler,
you finally got your rape into the case...

1545
01:34:25,244 --> 01:34:29,080
and I think all the details
should now be made clear to the jury.

1546
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:33,084
- Do you agree, Mr. Lodwick?
- Absolutely.

1547
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:36,546
What exactly was
the undergarment just referred to?

1548
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:38,339
Panties, Your Honor.

1549
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:40,279
Do you expect this
subject to come up again?

1550
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:42,134
Yes, sir.

1551
01:34:42,219 --> 01:34:46,556
There's a certain light connotation
attached to the word "panties."

1552
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:48,683
Can we find another name for them?

1553
01:34:48,767 --> 01:34:50,748
I never heard my wife
call 'em anything else.

1554
01:34:50,749 --> 01:34:52,728
Mr. Biegler?

1555
01:34:52,813 --> 01:34:57,608
- I'm a bachelor, Your Honor.
- That's a great help. Mr. Dancer?

1556
01:34:57,693 --> 01:35:02,530
When I was overseas during the war,
Your Honor, I... I learned a French word.

1557
01:35:02,614 --> 01:35:04,804
I'm afraid that it might
be slightly suggestive.

1558
01:35:04,805 --> 01:35:06,993
Most French words are.

1559
01:35:07,077 --> 01:35:10,121
All right, gentlemen. Back to your places.

1560
01:35:10,831 --> 01:35:15,501
For the benefit of the jury,
but more especially for the spectators...

1561
01:35:15,586 --> 01:35:19,380
the undergarment referred to
in the testimony was, to be exact...

1562
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:21,382
Mrs. Manion's panties.

1563
01:35:21,466 --> 01:35:24,635
[Spectators Laughing]

1564
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:29,307
I wanted you to get your snickering
over and done with.

1565
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:33,644
This pair of panties will be mentioned
again in the course of this trial...

1566
01:35:33,729 --> 01:35:36,230
and when it happens,
there will not be one laugh...

1567
01:35:36,315 --> 01:35:38,232
one snicker, one giggle...

1568
01:35:38,317 --> 01:35:41,444
or even one smirk in my courtroom.

1569
01:35:41,528 --> 01:35:45,156
There isn't anything comic
about a pair of panties...

1570
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:48,659
which figure in the violent death
of one man...

1571
01:35:48,744 --> 01:35:52,330
and the possible incarceration of another.

1572
01:35:52,873 --> 01:35:54,916
Proceed, Mr. Biegler.

1573
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,334
Did you give Mrs. Manion
a lie detector test?

1574
01:35:56,335 --> 01:35:57,668
Objection.

1575
01:35:57,753 --> 01:36:00,546
A polygraph test is inadmissible evidence
in our courts.

1576
01:36:00,631 --> 01:36:04,050
I only asked if he gave the test.
I didn't ask the results.

1577
01:36:04,134 --> 01:36:06,135
[Judge Weaver]
He may answer that.

1578
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:09,221
I gave her a lie detector
test at her request.

1579
01:36:09,306 --> 01:36:13,601
After all this investigation, did
you believe Mrs. Manion? - I did.

1580
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:17,063
- Even after the lie detector test?
- Your Honor, I object to that question!

1581
01:36:17,147 --> 01:36:19,190
It constitutes flagrant,
sneaking subterfuge

1582
01:36:19,191 --> 01:36:21,233
on the part of the
defense counsel.

1583
01:36:21,318 --> 01:36:25,029
Objection sustained.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1584
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:28,991
a polygraph or lie detector test
is not admissible in evidence...

1585
01:36:29,076 --> 01:36:31,452
because no one has ever been quite sure...

1586
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:35,498
that some people couldn't lie
to a lie detector and get away with it.

1587
01:36:35,582 --> 01:36:37,626
Go ahead, Mr. Biegler.

1588
01:36:37,627 --> 01:36:39,669
In any case, Sergeant
Durgo, you, yourself...

1589
01:36:39,753 --> 01:36:44,090
in your own heart and mind are quite
convinced of Mrs. Manion's honesty.

1590
01:36:44,174 --> 01:36:46,592
- Yes, sir.
- That's all.

1591
01:36:48,095 --> 01:36:50,096
- Just a moment.
- [Whispering]

1592
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:51,681
Yes, of course.

1593
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:55,790
Sergeant Durgo, did you
look for the panties

1594
01:36:55,791 --> 01:36:58,229
elsewhere than the
lane in the woods?

1595
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:01,148
We looked in Barney Quill's car
and his room in the hotel.

1596
01:37:01,233 --> 01:37:03,192
We didn't find the panties.

1597
01:37:03,276 --> 01:37:06,696
Do you know why Mrs. Manion
requested a lie detector test?

1598
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:08,864
- I know what she said.
- What was that?

1599
01:37:08,949 --> 01:37:10,908
She said she wanted everybody
to believe her story...

1600
01:37:10,993 --> 01:37:12,910
because she knew it would
help her husband.

1601
01:37:12,995 --> 01:37:14,578
Was that the only reason she gave?

1602
01:37:14,663 --> 01:37:16,748
She said she'd already
sworn to her husband.

1603
01:37:16,749 --> 01:37:18,833
She wanted everybody
else to believe it too.

1604
01:37:18,917 --> 01:37:21,085
One moment, please, Your Honor.

1605
01:37:24,715 --> 01:37:27,341
Ask him in what manner she swore.

1606
01:37:27,426 --> 01:37:30,678
Did Mrs. Manion say how
she had sworn to her husband?

1607
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:34,390
Yes, sir. She said she'd sworn on a rosary.

1608
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:39,186
Sergeant, this lane in the woods...
What's it used for? Where does it go?

1609
01:37:39,730 --> 01:37:42,857
Used to be a logging road.
Doesn't go anyplace. Just stops.

1610
01:37:42,941 --> 01:37:44,859
Who uses it now?

1611
01:37:44,943 --> 01:37:46,861
I think it's a road
kids drive down to park.

1612
01:37:46,862 --> 01:37:48,779
You mean it's a lovers' lane.

1613
01:37:48,864 --> 01:37:51,449
- I think so. Yes, sir.
- The witness is yours, Mr. Biegler.

1614
01:37:51,533 --> 01:37:54,452
- No more questions.
- [Judge Weaver] The witness may step down.

1615
01:37:54,536 --> 01:37:58,706
In view of the evidence concerning rape
which Your Honor has ruled admissible...

1616
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:02,084
the prosecution asks for a 30-minute recess
in order that we may bring in...

1617
01:38:02,169 --> 01:38:04,295
another witness whom
we had not anticipated using.

1618
01:38:04,379 --> 01:38:08,215
- All right. We'll take a 30-minute recess.
- Recess.

1619
01:38:15,432 --> 01:38:17,767
Why didn't you tell me about that rosary?

1620
01:38:19,061 --> 01:38:21,145
We forgot it.

1621
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:23,293
We didn't forget it.

1622
01:38:23,294 --> 01:38:25,357
Manny said maybe we
shouldn't tell that again.

1623
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:29,904
It might have looked like something else.
Like I-I didn't believe her.

1624
01:38:31,323 --> 01:38:33,240
How much more didn't you tell me?

1625
01:38:33,325 --> 01:38:36,494
Everything else.
We told you everything else.

1626
01:38:36,578 --> 01:38:38,496
Is that right, Laura?

1627
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:40,664
Oh, yes. Everything else.

1628
01:38:40,749 --> 01:38:43,000
All right. Now get this, both of ya.

1629
01:38:43,085 --> 01:38:46,295
When you get up on that stand,
I want you to tell the truth.

1630
01:38:47,005 --> 01:38:49,340
I don't want you to tell
anything but the truth.

1631
01:38:49,424 --> 01:38:54,637
Don't try and lie. Don't try and conceal
anything, or you'll get skinned alive.

1632
01:38:54,721 --> 01:38:56,889
This fellow Dancer's gonna move in.

1633
01:39:17,828 --> 01:39:21,372
[Dancer] Dr. Dompierre, did you have
occasion to come to the county jail...

1634
01:39:21,456 --> 01:39:23,916
on the night of August
the 15th of this year?

1635
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,544
- I did.
- Who called you to the jail?

1636
01:39:26,628 --> 01:39:30,089
- The police authorities.
- What did they want you to do?

1637
01:39:30,173 --> 01:39:32,967
They wanted me to make a test
for the presence of sperm...

1638
01:39:33,051 --> 01:39:35,719
on the person of a Mrs. Frederick Manion.

1639
01:39:35,804 --> 01:39:37,681
I made the test.

1640
01:39:37,682 --> 01:39:39,557
In making this test,
what was your conclusion?

1641
01:39:39,641 --> 01:39:42,935
- Negative. There was none.
- Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

1642
01:39:44,146 --> 01:39:46,063
Doctor, in making these tests...

1643
01:39:46,148 --> 01:39:48,899
did you notice any bruises or marks
on Mrs. Manion at that time?

1644
01:39:48,984 --> 01:39:50,192
I did.

1645
01:39:50,277 --> 01:39:52,611
Were you asked to determine the reason
for these bruises?

1646
01:39:52,696 --> 01:39:54,196
I was not.

1647
01:39:54,281 --> 01:39:57,199
Where did you do the laboratory work
on your test for sperm?

1648
01:39:57,284 --> 01:39:59,577
Saint Margaret's hospital in this city.

1649
01:39:59,661 --> 01:40:03,747
- Who worked up the slides for you?
- A technician at the hospital.

1650
01:40:03,832 --> 01:40:07,251
Well, wouldn't it have been better
to have these slides worked up...

1651
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:10,045
by a pathologist or an
expert in this field?

1652
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:12,631
Well, yes, but the police
were in a hurry...

1653
01:40:12,716 --> 01:40:15,759
and I happened to know this young fella
came on at 7:00 in the morning.

1654
01:40:15,844 --> 01:40:18,554
Wouldn't it have been especially better
to wait for the expert...

1655
01:40:18,638 --> 01:40:21,432
if the possible question of rape
hung on the result?

1656
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:24,059
- It would have been.
- Now, Doctor, in the newspaper...

1657
01:40:24,144 --> 01:40:28,063
on the evening of August the 16th, it was
stated that you found no evidence of rape.

1658
01:40:28,148 --> 01:40:31,525
- Is that true?
- It is not true. I made no such statement.

1659
01:40:31,610 --> 01:40:35,446
But did you form an opinion
as to whether Mrs. Manion had been raped?

1660
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:37,781
- No.
- Why didn't you form an opinion?

1661
01:40:37,866 --> 01:40:42,119
It's impossible to tell
if a mature, married woman has been raped.

1662
01:40:42,204 --> 01:40:44,663
- That's all.
- Doctor...

1663
01:40:44,748 --> 01:40:46,583
did you have an opinion
about whether or not

1664
01:40:46,584 --> 01:40:48,417
she'd had any recent
relations with a man?

1665
01:40:48,501 --> 01:40:51,212
Insofar as no sperm was present...

1666
01:40:51,296 --> 01:40:54,256
it didn't appear that she had
had recent relations with a man.

1667
01:40:54,341 --> 01:40:57,009
- That's all.
- Just one more question, Doctor.

1668
01:40:57,093 --> 01:40:59,303
The fact that no evidence
was present in her body...

1669
01:40:59,387 --> 01:41:01,639
does not mean that
she was not raped, does it?

1670
01:41:01,723 --> 01:41:03,224
No.

1671
01:41:03,308 --> 01:41:05,809
Do you know what constitutes rape
under the law?

1672
01:41:05,894 --> 01:41:07,353
Yes, sir.

1673
01:41:07,437 --> 01:41:09,647
Violation is sufficient for rape.

1674
01:41:09,731 --> 01:41:11,732
There need not be a completion.

1675
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:14,485
- No further questions.
- [Judge Weaver] The witness may step down.

1676
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:17,738
The People recall
Alphonse Paquette to the stand.

1677
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:21,784
Your Honor, since counsel for the defense
has forced the question of rape...

1678
01:41:21,868 --> 01:41:25,079
it becomes necessary to take this
additional testimony from Mr. Paquette.

1679
01:41:25,163 --> 01:41:27,456
You're still under oath, Mr. Paquette.

1680
01:41:27,958 --> 01:41:29,541
Mr. Paquette...

1681
01:41:31,253 --> 01:41:34,421
would you take a look at Mrs. Manion,
seated there behind the defense table?

1682
01:41:34,506 --> 01:41:36,674
Was she dressed in this manner
on the night of the shooting?

1683
01:41:36,758 --> 01:41:38,592
- No.
- How was she dressed?

1684
01:41:38,677 --> 01:41:42,263
She had on a real tight skirt
and sweater kind of thing.

1685
01:41:42,347 --> 01:41:46,809
Sort of glued on. She was wearing
a pair of red shoes with high heels.

1686
01:41:46,893 --> 01:41:50,312
- Was she wearing hose?
- No. She was bare legged.

1687
01:41:50,397 --> 01:41:52,898
- Was she wearing a hat?
- No.

1688
01:41:52,983 --> 01:41:57,111
Um, Mr. Paquette, what kind of hair
does Mrs. Manion have under that hat?

1689
01:41:57,195 --> 01:42:00,489
Well, we'd be very happy
to show the court Mrs. Manion's hair.

1690
01:42:00,573 --> 01:42:04,034
Mrs. Manion, would you take off
your hat, please?

1691
01:42:04,119 --> 01:42:06,495
[Spectators Murmur]

1692
01:42:08,581 --> 01:42:10,666
Thank you, Mr. Biegler.

1693
01:42:11,293 --> 01:42:14,336
Mr. Paquette, was she wearing
glasses that night?

1694
01:42:14,963 --> 01:42:17,089
I think she was when she played pinball.

1695
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:21,927
Considering the tight skirt
and the tight sweater and the bare legs...

1696
01:42:22,012 --> 01:42:24,722
- what was the result in her appearance?
- Well...

1697
01:42:24,806 --> 01:42:29,393
Would you say that Mrs. Manion's appearance
was deliberately voluptuous and enticing?

1698
01:42:29,477 --> 01:42:31,395
You could pretty much
see everything she had.

1699
01:42:31,479 --> 01:42:35,190
Your Honor, the defense will concede that
Mrs. Manion, when dressed informally...

1700
01:42:35,275 --> 01:42:37,735
is an astonishingly beautiful woman.

1701
01:42:37,819 --> 01:42:40,654
And we... Well, Mrs. Manion,
stand up, please. Will you?

1702
01:42:40,739 --> 01:42:42,740
As a matter of fact...
Take your glasses off.

1703
01:42:42,824 --> 01:42:45,242
As a matter of fact,
it's pretty easy to understand...

1704
01:42:45,327 --> 01:42:47,494
why her husband
became temporarily deranged...

1705
01:42:47,579 --> 01:42:50,914
when he saw such beauty
bruised and torn by a beast.

1706
01:42:50,999 --> 01:42:53,250
Your Honor, I protest.

1707
01:42:53,335 --> 01:42:55,336
Mr. Biegler is perhaps
the least disciplined...

1708
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:58,839
and the most completely out-of-order
attorney I've ever seen in a courtroom.

1709
01:42:58,923 --> 01:43:01,717
The jury will ignore Mr. Biegler's oration.

1710
01:43:04,095 --> 01:43:08,015
Uh, was Mrs. Manion drinking
heavily that night?

1711
01:43:08,683 --> 01:43:12,603
I sold her six drinks myself, and then
Barney came over and got some more for her.

1712
01:43:12,687 --> 01:43:15,522
- I don't remember how many.
- Would you say that she was tight?

1713
01:43:15,607 --> 01:43:17,192
Oh, she was high, all right.

1714
01:43:17,193 --> 01:43:18,776
What did she do to make
you think she was high?

1715
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:21,987
[Paquette] Well, she took off
her shoes and went barefooted, and...

1716
01:43:22,072 --> 01:43:26,116
when she played pinball she'd kind of
swish around to give the machine English.

1717
01:43:26,201 --> 01:43:28,495
You mean she was
flipping her hips around.

1718
01:43:28,496 --> 01:43:30,788
Yeah.

1719
01:43:30,872 --> 01:43:32,790
Anything else?

1720
01:43:32,874 --> 01:43:34,917
Well, when she made a
good score, she jumped

1721
01:43:34,918 --> 01:43:36,960
up and down and
squealed like women do.

1722
01:43:37,045 --> 01:43:40,756
[Chuckles] She was playing pinball
with Barney Quill that night, wasn't she?

1723
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:41,987
Yes, sir.

1724
01:43:41,988 --> 01:43:43,133
What was her attitude
toward Barney Quill?

1725
01:43:43,218 --> 01:43:45,135
Friendly, I guess you could call it.

1726
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:47,137
- More than friendly, would you say?
- I thought so.

1727
01:43:47,222 --> 01:43:49,223
[Dancer] Why did you think so?

1728
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:52,581
Well, she...
she'd kind of lean on him, and a

1729
01:43:52,582 --> 01:43:55,062
couple of times she
bumped him with her hip.

1730
01:43:56,689 --> 01:44:00,818
Uh, would you say that Mrs. Manion
was making a play for Barney Quill?

1731
01:44:01,403 --> 01:44:04,655
Objection. That calls for an assumption
on the part of the witness, Your Honor.

1732
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:07,032
I withdraw the question.
Would you say that, uh...

1733
01:44:07,117 --> 01:44:09,827
Mrs. Manion was free and easy
with Barney Quill?

1734
01:44:09,911 --> 01:44:12,079
- I would.
- Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

1735
01:44:12,163 --> 01:44:15,374
Mr. Paquette,
the attorney for the People asked you...

1736
01:44:15,458 --> 01:44:20,129
if Mrs. Manion was tight,
and you said that she was high.

1737
01:44:20,213 --> 01:44:24,258
Now, speaking as a bartender,
what's the distinction between the two?

1738
01:44:24,342 --> 01:44:27,302
- I don't think I understand.
- Well, I mean...

1739
01:44:27,387 --> 01:44:29,535
when we say a person's
tight, we usually mean

1740
01:44:29,536 --> 01:44:31,682
that they're a little
stupid with the drink.

1741
01:44:31,766 --> 01:44:34,768
- Isn't that so?
- I guess that's about it. Yes.

1742
01:44:34,853 --> 01:44:38,105
And if they're high,
they're gay and enjoying themselves.

1743
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:41,358
- Yes.
- In other words, Mrs. Manion was happy.

1744
01:44:41,443 --> 01:44:44,445
Well, now, is there anything wrong
with being happy in Thunder Bay Inn?

1745
01:44:44,529 --> 01:44:48,407
- No.
- Thunder Bay itself is a resort, isn't it?

1746
01:44:48,491 --> 01:44:51,577
- Swimming, fishing, that sort of thing?
- Yes.

1747
01:44:51,661 --> 01:44:55,080
Is there anything unusual about
seeing a barefooted woman in Thunder Bay?

1748
01:44:55,165 --> 01:44:56,937
No.

1749
01:44:56,938 --> 01:44:58,709
So Mrs. Manion's taking her
shoes off in Thunder Bay...

1750
01:44:58,793 --> 01:45:01,712
that doesn't necessarily mean
that she was being unladylike, does it?

1751
01:45:01,796 --> 01:45:03,714
- I guess not.
- Yes or no?

1752
01:45:03,798 --> 01:45:05,299
No!

1753
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:09,720
Now, you testified...

1754
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:14,057
that Mrs. Manion was squealing
and jumping up and down and...

1755
01:45:15,018 --> 01:45:17,769
and swishing her...
I think that was the expression you used...

1756
01:45:17,854 --> 01:45:19,938
swishing her hips
around the pinball machine.

1757
01:45:20,023 --> 01:45:23,525
Now, was she creating a disturbance?
Was she attracting a crowd?

1758
01:45:23,610 --> 01:45:25,527
- No.
- Were all the men at the bar...

1759
01:45:25,612 --> 01:45:27,529
Were they all standing around
watching Mrs. Manion?

1760
01:45:27,614 --> 01:45:28,698
No.

1761
01:45:28,699 --> 01:45:29,781
But you were very
conscious of Mrs. Manion.

1762
01:45:29,866 --> 01:45:32,784
You were conscious enough so that you
can tell us all about her actions.

1763
01:45:32,869 --> 01:45:35,621
Yes. - And certainly Barney Quill,
he was conscious of Mrs. Manion...

1764
01:45:35,705 --> 01:45:38,582
because he was playing pinball
with Mrs. Manion, wouldn't you say so?

1765
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:40,313
Yes.

1766
01:45:40,314 --> 01:45:41,960
So it seems that only
you and Barney Quill...

1767
01:45:42,045 --> 01:45:46,089
were acutely aware of Mrs. Manion
and her actions and her appearance.

1768
01:45:46,174 --> 01:45:48,967
And maybe good old Barney, when he
came up to get some drinks from you...

1769
01:45:49,052 --> 01:45:53,722
maybe he winked and said, "Alphonse,
I'm gonna take this babe out and rape her."

1770
01:45:53,806 --> 01:45:55,558
No! No, he didn't.

1771
01:45:55,559 --> 01:45:57,309
Yeah, and maybe you said,
"Do it once for me, boss!"

1772
01:45:57,393 --> 01:45:58,915
[Dancer] Objection, objection.

1773
01:45:58,916 --> 01:46:00,437
Those are not questions.
Counsel is attacking...

1774
01:46:00,522 --> 01:46:02,689
- No more questions!
- [Gavel Rapping]

1775
01:46:02,774 --> 01:46:06,777
The court's had about all of this dogfight
it can take for one day...

1776
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:10,364
and I'm sure the jury
is equally tired and hungry.

1777
01:46:10,448 --> 01:46:14,243
Tomorrow the defense takes over,
and with expedition, prayer...

1778
01:46:14,327 --> 01:46:16,787
and a little self-discipline
on the part of counsel...

1779
01:46:16,871 --> 01:46:19,581
perhaps we can reach an end
by Saturday night.

1780
01:46:19,666 --> 01:46:22,543
- Will you adjourn court?
- [Gavel Raps]

1781
01:46:22,627 --> 01:46:25,171
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.
This court stands

1782
01:46:25,172 --> 01:46:27,714
adjourned until 9:00
tomorrow morning.

1783
01:46:45,567 --> 01:46:48,735
[Horn Honking]

1784
01:47:08,423 --> 01:47:11,925
He's banged up a little,
but there doesn't seem to be anything else.

1785
01:47:12,010 --> 01:47:14,052
We'd like to watch him for a day or so.

1786
01:47:14,721 --> 01:47:18,890
- How much damage did he do?
- Wrecked a gate and a barn door.

1787
01:47:20,184 --> 01:47:22,603
And he hasn't got a driver's license.

1788
01:47:23,646 --> 01:47:27,399
He'll have to appear
in the J.P. court when he's able.

1789
01:47:27,483 --> 01:47:31,486
- The old fool.
- Speak kindly of the dead.

1790
01:47:31,571 --> 01:47:33,030
Do you mind if I have a
minute with the corpse?

1791
01:47:33,031 --> 01:47:34,489
Sure, Polly.

1792
01:47:38,786 --> 01:47:41,705
Now, was it worth trying
to kill yourself...

1793
01:47:41,789 --> 01:47:44,124
for whatever it is you've been up to?

1794
01:47:44,792 --> 01:47:46,710
How's the trial goin'?

1795
01:47:46,794 --> 01:47:50,172
Well, I'm making a lot of noise.
Dancer's racking up all the points.

1796
01:47:50,256 --> 01:47:52,799
No, but come on.
Now, where have you been?

1797
01:47:53,885 --> 01:47:58,055
Quill hired Mary Pilant
up north of the Sault Sainte Marie.

1798
01:47:58,139 --> 01:48:00,308
Struck me funny he'd go
all the way up there

1799
01:48:00,309 --> 01:48:02,476
to hire somebody just
to work for him.

1800
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,519
I been up there nosin' around.

1801
01:48:04,604 --> 01:48:06,772
Well, did you find anything useful?

1802
01:48:06,856 --> 01:48:09,733
Not until I looked up
her birth certificate.

1803
01:48:09,817 --> 01:48:15,280
Born Blind River, Ontario,
1934, out of wedlock.

1804
01:48:15,365 --> 01:48:19,785
Mother was a waitress: Simone Pilant.

1805
01:48:19,869 --> 01:48:24,164
Father was a lumberjack.
Name: Barney Quill.

1806
01:48:31,631 --> 01:48:34,091
Say, I'd like to see Miss Mary Pilant.

1807
01:48:34,676 --> 01:48:37,719
- It's late, mister.
- I know. I know. This is important.

1808
01:48:37,804 --> 01:48:39,971
- Real important?
- Real important.

1809
01:48:42,725 --> 01:48:45,102
- [Line Rings]
- [Woman] Yes?

1810
01:48:45,186 --> 01:48:47,167
Miss Pilant, sorry
if I woke you up.

1811
01:48:47,168 --> 01:48:49,147
There's a guy to see you.
Says it's real important.

1812
01:48:49,232 --> 01:48:50,774
- What's your, uh...
- Paul Biegler.

1813
01:48:50,858 --> 01:48:53,235
- Biegler.
- I don't wish to see him.

1814
01:48:53,319 --> 01:48:55,570
- Okay.
- [Buzzes]

1815
01:48:55,655 --> 01:48:57,823
She, uh, said it's not important enough.

1816
01:48:57,907 --> 01:49:02,035
All right. Now you call her back and tell
her I mentioned Blind River, Ontario.

1817
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:04,037
I'll be in the bar.

01:49:20,179 --> 01:49:21,972
Evening, Alphonse.

Well, I think I'll try a little of both.

What do you say we start out with a beer?

1824
01:49:33,609 --> 01:49:35,777
On the house, and that's all you get.

1825
01:49:35,862 --> 01:49:38,488
A beer. No questions, no answers.

[Footsteps Approaching]

1829
01:49:46,414 --> 01:49:48,457
Will you sit over there, please?

1830
01:49:54,422 --> 01:49:56,339
Miss Pilant, I owe you an apology.

1831
01:49:56,424 --> 01:49:58,675
I was a little rough
when I was out here before.

1832
01:49:59,927 --> 01:50:02,095
I didn't know that Barney Quill
was your father.

1833
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:05,015
- You didn't come here just to apologize.
- No. No.

1834
01:50:05,099 --> 01:50:07,017
But the apology was part of it.

1835
01:50:07,101 --> 01:50:11,104
To tell the truth, I sort of hoped
maybe it would thaw you out a bit.

1836
01:50:11,814 --> 01:50:15,650
All I want you to do is just listen to me.
Just for a few minutes.

1837
01:50:16,235 --> 01:50:20,906
Now, I need some strong evidence to back
up Laura Manion's story about the rape.

1838
01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:24,409
The prosecution's gonna
attack that story pretty hard.

1839
01:50:24,494 --> 01:50:27,120
And if... if the jury thinks she's lying...

1840
01:50:27,205 --> 01:50:30,290
well, that could turn the decision
against Manion, you see.

1841
01:50:30,374 --> 01:50:35,045
Well, isn't she lying? Barney didn't do
what she said he did. He couldn't have.

1842
01:50:35,671 --> 01:50:39,299
- What did you know about your father?
- All I needed to know.

1843
01:50:39,383 --> 01:50:43,386
He took care of me and of my mother
for as long as she lived.

1844
01:50:43,471 --> 01:50:46,723
He was always there when I needed him.

1845
01:50:46,808 --> 01:50:49,059
That's what I know
about my father, Mr. Biegler.

1846
01:50:49,143 --> 01:50:51,728
Will that back up Laura Manion's story?

1847
01:50:51,813 --> 01:50:54,898
Miss Pilant, I don't want to get at you.
I don't want to hurt you.

1848
01:50:54,982 --> 01:50:57,192
I appreciate your affection
for your father...

1849
01:50:57,276 --> 01:51:00,320
but... but as a lawyer I've had to learn...

1850
01:51:00,404 --> 01:51:03,156
that people aren't just good or just bad.

1851
01:51:03,241 --> 01:51:05,408
But people are many things.

1852
01:51:05,493 --> 01:51:08,703
And I kind of have a feeling
that Barney Quill was many things.

1853
01:51:08,788 --> 01:51:12,082
- I don't want to hear that.
- No, no, please. Please now, hear me out.

1854
01:51:12,166 --> 01:51:16,086
I believe that Barney told
Al Paquette what happened that night...

1855
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:19,422
and he told him to go to this window
and wait for Manion.

1856
01:51:19,507 --> 01:51:24,177
Barney stayed behind the bar
next to a gun rack, just waiting.

1857
01:51:24,262 --> 01:51:27,556
Manion came in and fired
the minute he got inside that door...

1858
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:30,433
and the first shot went
right through Barney's heart.

1859
01:51:30,518 --> 01:51:32,853
Now, here's what I want you to do.

1860
01:51:32,937 --> 01:51:37,399
I want you to try to persuade Al to come
to the court as a defense witness...

1861
01:51:37,483 --> 01:51:40,610
and tell the court exactly
what Barney told him that night.

1862
01:51:40,695 --> 01:51:43,613
That he'd raped and assaulted Mrs. Manion.

1863
01:51:43,698 --> 01:51:46,283
Al wouldn't conceal a thing like that.

1864
01:51:46,367 --> 01:51:48,410
Why wouldn't he tell it, if it were true?

1865
01:51:48,494 --> 01:51:51,746
I don't know. I don't know.
But I know this.

1866
01:51:51,831 --> 01:51:55,292
Everybody loves something or someone.

1867
01:51:55,376 --> 01:51:57,335
Me, I love fishing...

1868
01:51:57,420 --> 01:51:59,629
and an old guy by the name of Parnell.

1869
01:51:59,714 --> 01:52:03,258
Manion loves his freedom.
He'd like to have a little more of it.

1870
01:52:03,342 --> 01:52:06,970
Barney loved you. Maybe so does Al.

1871
01:52:07,638 --> 01:52:10,557
I wouldn't blame him.
But he doesn't want to hurt you.

1872
01:52:10,641 --> 01:52:13,435
He doesn't want you to know
the truth about Barney...

1873
01:52:13,519 --> 01:52:15,478
that he could be dangerous and brutal.

1874
01:52:15,563 --> 01:52:17,669
Now, if you'd just ask AI.

1875
01:52:17,670 --> 01:52:19,774
If you could just ask
him right straight out.

1876
01:52:20,484 --> 01:52:21,776
AI?

1877
01:52:30,119 --> 01:52:33,914
Al, Mr. Biegler knows
that Barney was my father.

1878
01:52:35,249 --> 01:52:38,335
He thinks you know something
about the night my father was killed...

1879
01:52:38,419 --> 01:52:40,837
something you won't tell.

1880
01:52:40,922 --> 01:52:43,548
Lawyer, I told you once,
and I'll tell you again.

1881
01:52:43,633 --> 01:52:46,426
- No questions, no answers.
- Wait, Al.

1882
01:52:49,096 --> 01:52:51,514
Did my father rape Mrs. Manion?

1883
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:54,517
Barney wouldn't hurt a woman.

1884
01:52:56,395 --> 01:52:59,773
Is there any reason you wouldn't tell me
the truth about that, Al?

1885
01:53:00,942 --> 01:53:02,901
What reason?

1886
01:53:09,116 --> 01:53:11,660
- Anything else, Mr. Biegler?
- No.

1887
01:53:11,744 --> 01:53:14,621
I'm gonna leave a pass
for you and Al at the trial.

1888
01:53:14,705 --> 01:53:17,791
You might like to watch
Lieutenant Manion get convicted.

1889
01:53:18,376 --> 01:53:20,460
You gonna spread it around
about Mary being Barney's kid?

1890
01:53:20,544 --> 01:53:22,796
No, I'm not gonna spread it around, Al.

1891
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:26,132
Thank you for the beer.
Good night, Miss Pilant.

1892
01:53:30,221 --> 01:53:32,973
All right,
now let's get at this rosary thing.

1893
01:53:33,057 --> 01:53:36,309
Now, it's been testified
that your wife swore to you on a rosary...

1894
01:53:36,394 --> 01:53:39,145
that she'd been raped by Barney Quill.

1895
01:53:39,230 --> 01:53:41,690
Did you ask your wife to swear on a rosary?

1896
01:53:42,733 --> 01:53:45,902
My wife was hysterical.
She wasn't making much sense.

1897
01:53:45,987 --> 01:53:49,155
I thought if I asked her
to take an oath on a rosary...

1898
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:51,992
it might serve to calm her,
make her think more clearly.

1899
01:53:52,076 --> 01:53:53,994
Did the rosary help?

1900
01:53:54,078 --> 01:53:56,496
She was able to tell me
in detail what had happened.

1901
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:58,498
All right. Go on from there now.

1902
01:53:58,582 --> 01:54:00,834
What did you do then, Lieutenant?

1903
01:54:00,918 --> 01:54:04,504
Well, I... I had her lie on the bed...

1904
01:54:04,588 --> 01:54:08,508
and I got some cold cloths for her head.

1905
01:54:08,592 --> 01:54:12,512
And, uh... Oh, yes.
I gave her a drink of brandy.

1906
01:54:14,765 --> 01:54:16,683
After a while she became calm...

1907
01:54:16,767 --> 01:54:19,352
seemed to go to sleep.

1908
01:54:19,437 --> 01:54:24,024
Then I went to the closet,
I got my gun, and I loaded it.

1909
01:54:24,108 --> 01:54:27,986
- Was it in your mind to kill Barney Quill?
- No.

1910
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:31,448
Well, then why did you go to the closet
and get your gun and load it?

1911
01:54:31,532 --> 01:54:33,284
Well, I-I-I knew I had
to go to Quill's place.

1912
01:54:33,285 --> 01:54:35,035
I thought I might need it.

1913
01:54:35,119 --> 01:54:36,870
Why?

1914
01:54:36,954 --> 01:54:39,706
I knew Mr. Quill kept guns behind the bar.

1915
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:41,708
I was afraid he might shoot me.

1916
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:45,170
Might shoot you if you did what?
What were you gonna do?

1917
01:54:46,213 --> 01:54:48,631
I'm not sure.

1918
01:54:48,716 --> 01:54:51,551
I remember having some idea...

1919
01:54:51,635 --> 01:54:53,887
of finding him...

1920
01:54:53,971 --> 01:54:56,890
and holding him while I called the police.

1921
01:54:56,974 --> 01:54:58,975
Well, that Mr... what's his name...

1922
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:01,936
Mr. Lemon, right at the tourist court
there, he was a deputy sheriff.

1923
01:55:02,021 --> 01:55:03,938
Why didn't you get him to go with you?

1924
01:55:04,774 --> 01:55:08,902
Maybe because he always seemed to be
just the old caretaker of the park.

1925
01:55:10,321 --> 01:55:14,032
Maybe because I wasn't
thinking about anything too clearly...

1926
01:55:14,116 --> 01:55:16,076
except finding Barney Quill.

1927
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:19,829
Why didn't you go to a telephone, call the
state police before you went to the bar?

1928
01:55:19,914 --> 01:55:22,082
I don't know.

1929
01:55:22,166 --> 01:55:24,417
I was in sort of a daze.

1930
01:55:25,503 --> 01:55:28,463
It was a horrible thing
to see what had been done to my wife.

1931
01:55:28,547 --> 01:55:30,757
Now, you say you were in a sort of a daze.

1932
01:55:30,841 --> 01:55:34,260
When you got to the bar,
did you see that the bar was crowded?

1933
01:55:35,012 --> 01:55:36,930
I...

1934
01:55:37,014 --> 01:55:39,557
I didn't see anyone at the bar...

1935
01:55:40,351 --> 01:55:42,435
except Barney Quill.

1936
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:44,437
He was the only person I saw.

1937
01:55:44,522 --> 01:55:46,523
What was he doing?

1938
01:55:47,191 --> 01:55:50,985
I think he was just
standing there behind the bar.

1939
01:55:51,070 --> 01:55:55,073
Well, now, did he make
a threatening move to get a gun?

1940
01:55:55,157 --> 01:55:56,699
I don't know.

1941
01:55:57,284 --> 01:55:58,910
He may have. I don't know.

1942
01:55:58,994 --> 01:56:01,454
All right.
Now, you say you went there to find him...

1943
01:56:01,539 --> 01:56:03,623
to hold him for the police.

1944
01:56:03,707 --> 01:56:05,625
Why did you shoot him?

1945
01:56:07,711 --> 01:56:10,046
I don't remember shooting him.

1946
01:56:10,631 --> 01:56:12,465
Now, when you left the bar...

1947
01:56:12,550 --> 01:56:15,301
do you remember Alphonse Paquette
coming up to you and stopping you...

1948
01:56:15,386 --> 01:56:17,470
and saying,
"You'd better not run away from this"...

1949
01:56:17,555 --> 01:56:21,224
and your reply,
"Do you want some too, buster?"

1950
01:56:21,308 --> 01:56:22,809
Remember that?

1951
01:56:23,519 --> 01:56:25,812
I-I seem to have a vague recollection...

1952
01:56:25,896 --> 01:56:27,814
of somebody speaking to me...

1953
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:32,902
but I don't remember what I said
or what was said to me.

1954
01:56:32,987 --> 01:56:35,905
When did you realize
that you had shot Quill?

1955
01:56:38,576 --> 01:56:40,994
I was... I was getting a drink of water.

1956
01:56:41,078 --> 01:56:43,997
I remember my throat was so dry it hurt.

1957
01:56:45,583 --> 01:56:48,001
And when I put the glass down,
I saw the gun...

1958
01:56:48,085 --> 01:56:50,503
on the kitchen sink beside the tap.

1959
01:56:51,589 --> 01:56:53,590
I noticed the gun was empty.

1960
01:56:54,675 --> 01:56:57,343
Now I'd like you to show
the court and jury...

1961
01:56:57,428 --> 01:56:59,012
just, uh...

1962
01:56:59,972 --> 01:57:02,515
just how you knew this gun was empty.

1963
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:05,018
Well, this gadget here...

1964
01:57:05,102 --> 01:57:08,396
when it sticks up,
you know the last round's been fired.

1965
01:57:09,106 --> 01:57:12,192
Lieutenant Manion,
on the night of the shooting...

1966
01:57:12,276 --> 01:57:14,194
did you love your wife?

1967
01:57:14,278 --> 01:57:17,655
- Yes, sir.
- Do you still love her?

1968
01:57:21,118 --> 01:57:22,952
Very much.

1969
01:57:23,704 --> 01:57:25,747
The witness is yours, Mr. Dancer.

1970
01:57:25,831 --> 01:57:27,707
Lieutenant Manion...

1971
01:57:28,959 --> 01:57:31,211
how many men have you killed?

1972
01:57:31,295 --> 01:57:33,213
Now wait a minute.

1973
01:57:33,881 --> 01:57:35,549
Your Honor, a man's
war record...

1974
01:57:35,550 --> 01:57:37,217
in Lieutenant Manion's
case, a great record...

1975
01:57:37,301 --> 01:57:39,219
certainly shouldn't be used against him.

1976
01:57:39,303 --> 01:57:42,222
Your Honor, I'm as patriotic
as the next man...

1977
01:57:42,306 --> 01:57:47,060
but the simple truth is, war can
condition a man to killing other men.

1978
01:57:47,144 --> 01:57:49,896
I simply want to determine
how conditioned the lieutenant may be...

1979
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:53,483
to the use of firearms
on other human beings.

1980
01:57:53,567 --> 01:57:55,485
I don't quite like the
question, Mr. Biegler...

1981
01:57:55,569 --> 01:57:57,570
but I don't see how I can exclude it.

1982
01:57:57,655 --> 01:57:59,572
Let him answer.

1983
01:57:59,657 --> 01:58:02,909
I know I killed
at least four men in Korea...

1984
01:58:02,993 --> 01:58:04,911
three with a hand grenade...

1985
01:58:04,995 --> 01:58:07,247
and one with my service automatic.

1986
01:58:07,331 --> 01:58:11,084
I may have killed others.
A soldier doesn't always know.

1987
01:58:11,168 --> 01:58:13,419
Now, Lieutenant, in these
acts of killing...

1988
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:15,421
did you ever have a lapse of memory...

1989
01:58:15,506 --> 01:58:16,799
such as you had when
you killed Barney Quill?

1990
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:18,091
No, sir.

1991
01:58:18,175 --> 01:58:20,593
Did you ever have
a lapse of memory during battle?

1992
01:58:20,678 --> 01:58:21,887
No, sir.

1993
01:58:21,888 --> 01:58:23,096
Were you ever submitted
to a constant barrage...

1994
01:58:23,180 --> 01:58:25,098
constantly in a sweat for many hours...

1995
01:58:25,182 --> 01:58:27,267
- constantly under attack, or attacking?
- Many times.

1996
01:58:27,351 --> 01:58:29,269
Were you ever treated for shell shock,
battle fatigue...

1997
01:58:29,353 --> 01:58:31,437
- or any war neurosis or psychosis?
- No, sir.

1998
01:58:31,522 --> 01:58:35,775
Did you ever experience
any unusual mental state during the war?

1999
01:58:35,859 --> 01:58:37,235
Well, I do remember
having one great urge.

2000
01:58:37,236 --> 01:58:38,611
What was that?

2001
01:58:38,696 --> 01:58:42,115
- To get the hell out and go home.
- [Spectators Laughing]

2002
01:58:42,199 --> 01:58:46,452
You would do well to consider the
seriousness of the situation you are in.

2003
01:58:46,537 --> 01:58:49,622
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.
- I sympathize with the lieutenant.

2004
01:58:49,707 --> 01:58:53,626
I expect he has the same feeling
about getting out of jail.

2005
01:58:53,711 --> 01:58:56,796
But the main point here, Lieutenant, is
that at no time during your war service...

2006
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,798
did you have a record
of mental disturbance.

2007
01:58:58,882 --> 01:59:00,967
You were always in complete possession
of your faculties.

2008
01:59:01,051 --> 01:59:03,636
Yes, sir, that's right.

2009
01:59:03,721 --> 01:59:06,306
- No more questions.
- [Biegler] No redirect, Your Honor.

2010
01:59:06,390 --> 01:59:08,975
[Judge Weaver]
Step down, please. Call your next witness.

2011
01:59:09,059 --> 01:59:11,644
We call Laura Manion to the stand.

2012
01:59:23,741 --> 01:59:26,659
- Up these stairs and to the right.
- Thank you.

2013
01:59:33,167 --> 01:59:35,626
Now, how long after you told your husband
what had happened...

2014
01:59:35,711 --> 01:59:37,962
did he leave the trailer?

2015
01:59:38,047 --> 01:59:40,131
I don't know exactly.

2016
01:59:40,215 --> 01:59:42,133
Everything was kind of fuzzy. I...

2017
01:59:42,217 --> 01:59:44,635
I was faint, and I lay down on the bed.

2018
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:46,804
He sat beside me.

2019
01:59:46,889 --> 01:59:49,974
I vaguely remember
his getting up and going out.

2020
01:59:50,059 --> 01:59:52,643
I remember wondering
if he was going for a doctor.

2021
01:59:52,728 --> 01:59:54,896
And then he came back in.

2022
01:59:54,980 --> 01:59:57,482
It seemed like just a few seconds,
but it must have been longer.

2023
01:59:57,566 --> 01:59:59,776
I must have gone to sleep.

2024
02:00:00,527 --> 02:00:03,154
When he came back in,
he sat on the bed...

2025
02:00:03,238 --> 02:00:05,448
and he had a gun in his hand.

2026
02:00:05,532 --> 02:00:08,618
And I said, "What are you going to do?"

2027
02:00:08,702 --> 02:00:11,662
And he said, "I think I've already done it.

2028
02:00:11,747 --> 02:00:13,831
I think I've killed Barney Quill."

2029
02:00:13,916 --> 02:00:17,335
Are you sure he didn't say
"I've killed Barney Quill"?

2030
02:00:17,419 --> 02:00:20,004
No, I... I remember distinctly.

2031
02:00:20,089 --> 02:00:22,006
"I think I've killed Barney Quill."

2032
02:00:22,091 --> 02:00:24,175
Then what did you do?

2033
02:00:24,259 --> 02:00:28,679
I put my arms around him
and began to cry and...

2034
02:00:28,764 --> 02:00:31,516
and I said,
"You'd better go to Mr. Lemon."

2035
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:33,518
And my husband said, "I forgot about that."

2036
02:00:33,602 --> 02:00:36,521
What did he mean? Forgot about what?

2037
02:00:36,605 --> 02:00:39,690
Well, he meant that he'd forgotten
Mr. Lemon was a deputy sheriff.

2038
02:00:39,775 --> 02:00:43,403
And he said,
"Yes, I'll go turn myself in to Mr. Lemon."

2039
02:00:43,487 --> 02:00:47,698
Yes, I see. Your Honor, I have no other
direct questions at this time...

2040
02:00:47,783 --> 02:00:50,368
but since I'm sure
it's difficult to visualize...

2041
02:00:50,452 --> 02:00:53,538
the part a little dog
played on this night...

2042
02:00:53,622 --> 02:00:57,542
I should like a few minutes to show the
court this remarkable little animal.

2043
02:00:57,626 --> 02:00:59,544
Do the People object?

2044
02:00:59,628 --> 02:01:01,546
I'm sure if we raise an objection,
Your Honor...

2045
02:01:01,630 --> 02:01:04,924
Mr. Biegler will declare that we're
haters of all small, furry animals.

2046
02:01:05,008 --> 02:01:06,947
[Spectators Chuckle]

2047
02:01:06,948 --> 02:01:08,886
A creature that cannot talk
will be a welcome relief.

2048
02:01:08,971 --> 02:01:11,222
- Bring in the dog.
- [Spectators Chuckling]

2049
02:01:11,306 --> 02:01:15,852
Thank you, sir. Will the, uh,
deputy bring in the dog, please.

2050
02:01:28,991 --> 02:01:31,284
Uh, you can put him right there.

2051
02:01:32,453 --> 02:01:34,370
Fine.
Here, Muff! Here, Muff! Come on!

2052
02:01:34,455 --> 02:01:36,372
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

2053
02:01:36,457 --> 02:01:38,458
That's a boy.

2054
02:01:39,126 --> 02:01:42,795
And now I'll ask Mrs. Manion
to bring a flashlight for the dog.

2055
02:01:53,849 --> 02:01:58,311
Now, I ask the court to notice
that the dog turned on the light.

2056
02:02:00,481 --> 02:02:02,815
[Laughing]

2057
02:02:07,321 --> 02:02:10,072
Well, it's easy to see that Muff
doesn't know who his enemies are.

2058
02:02:10,157 --> 02:02:12,283
- [Laughing Continues]
- Remove the dog, please.

2059
02:02:12,367 --> 02:02:14,285
- Yes, sir.
- The witness will resume the stand.

2060
02:02:14,369 --> 02:02:17,497
Here we go, Muff. All right.

2061
02:02:18,874 --> 02:02:23,127
Mrs. Manion, may I congratulate you
on your well-trained pet.

2062
02:02:23,212 --> 02:02:25,129
May I also say that I'm pleased to see...

2063
02:02:25,214 --> 02:02:28,466
you are not today
hiding your lovely hair under a hat.

2064
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:32,470
Your Honor, is the assistant attorney
general from Lansing pitching woo...

2065
02:02:32,554 --> 02:02:34,847
or is he going to cross-examine?

2066
02:02:34,932 --> 02:02:36,474
Let's get on with it.

2067
02:02:36,558 --> 02:02:38,809
Mrs. Manion, what was your occupation
before you were married?

2068
02:02:38,894 --> 02:02:41,896
- Housewife.
- Oh, then you've been married before?

2069
02:02:41,980 --> 02:02:44,295
Yes, once.

2070
02:02:44,296 --> 02:02:46,609
I suppose your first
husband, uh, died, hmm?

2071
02:02:46,693 --> 02:02:47,693
No.

2072
02:02:47,778 --> 02:02:50,321
Did you divorce your first husband
to marry Lieutenant Manion?

2073
02:02:50,405 --> 02:02:52,990
Your Honor, if counsel wants to know
the grounds for Mrs. Manion's divorce...

2074
02:02:53,075 --> 02:02:54,617
let him ask that question.

2075
02:02:54,701 --> 02:02:56,452
What were the grounds for divorce,
Mrs. Manion?

2076
02:02:56,537 --> 02:02:58,351
Mental cruelty.

2077
02:02:58,352 --> 02:03:00,164
Naturally.
And how long after your divorce...

2078
02:03:00,249 --> 02:03:02,458
was it that you married
Lieutenant Manion?

2079
02:03:02,543 --> 02:03:04,252
Uh, I'm not sure.

2080
02:03:04,336 --> 02:03:07,338
May I refresh the witness's memory
for Mr. Dancer?

2081
02:03:07,422 --> 02:03:09,340
- By all means.
- I believe she told me...

2082
02:03:09,424 --> 02:03:12,843
that they were married
three days after the divorce.

2083
02:03:12,928 --> 02:03:15,179
Thank you, Mr. Biegler.
ls that correct, Mrs. Manion?

2084
02:03:15,264 --> 02:03:16,722
Yes.

2085
02:03:16,807 --> 02:03:19,433
Then unless yours
was a whirlwind courtship...

2086
02:03:19,518 --> 02:03:21,644
you must have known Lieutenant Manion
before your divorce.

2087
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:23,688
- Did you?
- Yes.

2088
02:03:24,648 --> 02:03:28,359
Mrs. Manion, what is your...
[Clears Throat] religious affiliation?

2089
02:03:28,443 --> 02:03:30,361
[Laura] I'm a Catholic.

2090
02:03:30,445 --> 02:03:33,739
- Catholic in good standing?
- Well, no. The divorce, you know.

2091
02:03:33,824 --> 02:03:36,701
You mean you were excommunicated
because of the divorce and remarriage?

2092
02:03:36,785 --> 02:03:37,910
Yes.

2093
02:03:38,495 --> 02:03:42,164
Mrs. Manion, wouldn't you say
that a Catholic who can blithely ignore...

2094
02:03:42,249 --> 02:03:44,709
one of the cardinal rules of her church...

2095
02:03:44,793 --> 02:03:48,045
could also easily ignore
an oath taken on one of its artifacts...

2096
02:03:48,130 --> 02:03:50,590
say, an oath taken on a rosary?

2097
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:54,427
I-I-I don't think that's true.

2098
02:03:54,511 --> 02:03:56,200
But wouldn't you think
there'd be some doubt

2099
02:03:56,201 --> 02:03:57,888
about the integrity
of such a person?

2100
02:03:58,599 --> 02:04:00,600
I don't know. Uh...

2101
02:04:00,684 --> 02:04:03,227
All I know is the rosary
means something to me.

2102
02:04:03,770 --> 02:04:07,898
I see.
Well, I'll pass on to something else.

2103
02:04:07,983 --> 02:04:10,735
Mrs. Manion, you testified
that your husband came home late...

2104
02:04:10,819 --> 02:04:12,570
from his work
on the night of the shooting.

2105
02:04:12,654 --> 02:04:14,572
Were you a little angry
about his being late?

2106
02:04:14,656 --> 02:04:16,907
Well, I-I...
I guess I was a little put out.

2107
02:04:16,992 --> 02:04:19,910
- Did you have an argument?
- Not much. A little.

2108
02:04:19,995 --> 02:04:22,079
When you left the trailer
to go to the inn...

2109
02:04:22,164 --> 02:04:24,040
did your husband know you were going?

2110
02:04:24,124 --> 02:04:25,625
He was asleep.

2111
02:04:25,709 --> 02:04:27,752
Was part of your reason
for going without his knowledge...

2112
02:04:27,836 --> 02:04:30,129
because you were, uh, vexed?

2113
02:04:31,089 --> 02:04:34,258
Well, I-I'd been ironing all day and I...

2114
02:04:35,010 --> 02:04:36,553
Yes, I guess that's true.

2115
02:04:36,554 --> 02:04:38,095
Your Honor, the counsel
has deliberately...

2116
02:04:38,180 --> 02:04:39,805
cut off my view of the witness.

2117
02:04:39,890 --> 02:04:41,390
I'm sorry, Mr. Biegler.

2118
02:04:41,475 --> 02:04:43,684
I wouldn't want to interfere
with your signals to Mrs. Manion.

2119
02:04:43,769 --> 02:04:46,103
I object to the implication
I was signaling the witness.

2120
02:04:46,188 --> 02:04:49,106
This is the shabbiest
courtroom trick I've ever seen.

2121
02:04:49,191 --> 02:04:51,108
You haven't lived, Mr. Biegler.

2122
02:04:51,193 --> 02:04:53,569
Your Honor, I ask the court
to rule on my objection.

2123
02:04:53,654 --> 02:04:55,946
Mr. Dancer, will you be careful
not to place yourself...

2124
02:04:56,031 --> 02:04:58,324
between Mr. Biegler and his witness.

2125
02:04:58,408 --> 02:05:01,952
Of course, Your Honor.
Anything else, Mr. Biegler?

2126
02:05:02,037 --> 02:05:03,954
You do it once more, I'll punt you...

2127
02:05:04,039 --> 02:05:06,582
all the way out into
the middle of Lake Superior.

2128
02:05:06,667 --> 02:05:10,002
- [Spectators Laughing]
- [Judge Weaver] Gentlemen, gentlemen.

2129
02:05:10,087 --> 02:05:12,380
This rowing has got to stop.

2130
02:05:12,464 --> 02:05:16,467
The next one of you that speaks out of turn
will have me to deal with.

2131
02:05:16,551 --> 02:05:18,678
Now get on with your cross-examination.

2132
02:05:18,762 --> 02:05:22,014
Would you have gone to the inn
if your husband had, uh, been awake?

2133
02:05:22,099 --> 02:05:25,518
- He probably would have gone with me.
- But would you have gone alone?

2134
02:05:25,602 --> 02:05:29,188
- Not if he didn't want me to.
- Would he have not wanted you to?

2135
02:05:29,856 --> 02:05:32,566
I'm not sure.
I... I don't know how to answer that.

2136
02:05:32,651 --> 02:05:34,694
Well, had you ever gone
to the Thunder Bay Inn...

2137
02:05:34,778 --> 02:05:37,905
or elsewhere in Thunder Bay
alone at night?

2138
02:05:38,407 --> 02:05:41,617
- Yes, sometimes.
- Did your husband know you were going?

2139
02:05:42,494 --> 02:05:44,662
Not always. He goes to sleep early and...

2140
02:05:44,746 --> 02:05:47,623
and sometimes I'm restless.

2141
02:05:47,708 --> 02:05:49,834
Where did you go on these occasions?

2142
02:05:49,918 --> 02:05:53,713
Oh, I'd take a walk by the lake
or went to the bingo place.

2143
02:05:53,797 --> 02:05:57,216
- Maybe to the inn.
- You ever go to meet another man?

2144
02:05:57,759 --> 02:06:00,010
No, I didn't. I never did that.

2145
02:06:00,554 --> 02:06:04,348
You mean to say, Mrs. Manion, a lovely
woman like yourself, attractive to men...

2146
02:06:04,433 --> 02:06:06,475
lonely, restless, that you never once...

2147
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:09,520
Objection, Your Honor! The witness
has answered the question about other men.

2148
02:06:09,604 --> 02:06:12,356
Counsel is now making
a veiled suggestion to the jury.

2149
02:06:12,441 --> 02:06:14,525
I withdraw the question.

2150
02:06:14,609 --> 02:06:19,071
Now, Mrs. Manion, on these
occasional excursions into the night...

2151
02:06:19,156 --> 02:06:21,657
did you always go and return home alone?

2152
02:06:21,742 --> 02:06:23,284
Of course.

2153
02:06:23,368 --> 02:06:26,871
Mrs. Manion, you testified that the reason
you got into Barney Quill's car...

2154
02:06:26,955 --> 02:06:29,206
was because you were afraid
to go home alone.

2155
02:06:29,291 --> 02:06:31,459
Why were you so frightened
on this particular night?

2156
02:06:32,419 --> 02:06:36,005
I said that it was because he told me
bears had been seen around.

2157
02:06:36,590 --> 02:06:38,717
Was this the first time
you'd heard that bears

2158
02:06:38,718 --> 02:06:40,843
came around Thunder Bay
to pick up scraps?

2159
02:06:40,927 --> 02:06:43,262
- No.
- Had you seen the bears before?

2160
02:06:43,346 --> 02:06:44,513
Yes.

2161
02:06:44,598 --> 02:06:47,057
Oh, this was just the first time
you were afraid of them?

2162
02:06:47,142 --> 02:06:49,268
No, I was always afraid of them.

2163
02:06:49,352 --> 02:06:51,604
Oh, this was just the first time
you were enough afraid...

2164
02:06:51,688 --> 02:06:54,732
to allow a man to take you home
from one of your evening prowls?

2165
02:06:54,816 --> 02:06:58,402
Objection! The use of the word "prowl"
is meant to mislead the jury.

2166
02:06:58,487 --> 02:07:00,571
- [Judge Weaver] Sustained.
- I apologize.

2167
02:07:00,655 --> 02:07:04,658
Mrs. Manion, I didn't mean to imply
that you were a huntress.

2168
02:07:04,743 --> 02:07:06,702
Was this the first time
that you were enough afraid...

2169
02:07:06,787 --> 02:07:10,122
to allow a man to take you home
from one of your evening walks?

2170
02:07:10,832 --> 02:07:13,667
Well, it... it wasn't just that.

2171
02:07:13,752 --> 02:07:15,628
- It was...
- Oh, come now, Mrs. Manion.

2172
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:17,130
You should be able to
answer that straight off.

2173
02:07:17,131 --> 02:07:18,547
That's a simple enough question.

2174
02:07:18,632 --> 02:07:20,800
Your Honor,
how can the witness answer straight off...

2175
02:07:20,884 --> 02:07:23,219
when the counsel keeps
interrupting the answer?

2176
02:07:23,303 --> 02:07:26,430
The witness seemed a little slow to me,
Mr. Biegler.

2177
02:07:26,515 --> 02:07:29,433
However, let her complete her answers
before you interrupt.

2178
02:07:29,518 --> 02:07:32,269
Of course, Your Honor.
In any case, Mr. Biegler's objection...

2179
02:07:32,354 --> 02:07:35,231
has given Mrs. Manion sufficient time
to think of an answer to my question.

2180
02:07:35,315 --> 02:07:37,274
You've thought of one,
haven't you, Mrs. Manion?

2181
02:07:37,359 --> 02:07:40,611
What I was going to say was that I
didn't want to offend Mr. Quill...

2182
02:07:40,695 --> 02:07:43,948
by making him think that I was
afraid of him or didn't like him.

2183
02:07:44,032 --> 02:07:47,743
He'd been very pleasant to my husband
and me when we'd been in his bar.

2184
02:07:47,828 --> 02:07:49,642
That's very good, Mrs. Manion.
Very good indeed.

2185
02:07:49,643 --> 02:07:51,455
Your Honor, please.

2186
02:07:51,540 --> 02:07:55,960
The attorney for the People will reserve
his comments for the arguments.

2187
02:07:56,044 --> 02:07:58,504
I will ask you this question, Mrs. Manion.

2188
02:07:59,089 --> 02:08:04,218
Was this the first time you had been
in Barney Quill's car at night?

2189
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:09,682
Mrs. Manion, did you hear the question?

2190
02:08:10,225 --> 02:08:11,809
Yes, I heard.

2191
02:08:12,561 --> 02:08:14,854
Yes, it was the first time.

2192
02:08:15,564 --> 02:08:18,399
Would you raise your voice a little,
Mrs. Manion?

2193
02:08:18,483 --> 02:08:21,193
[Laura]
I said it was the first time.

2194
02:08:22,279 --> 02:08:26,657
Now, Mrs. Manion,
I'm quite concerned about the lost panties.

2195
02:08:26,741 --> 02:08:29,535
Would you describe this article of clothing
to the court, please?

2196
02:08:31,329 --> 02:08:33,998
They were nylon
and had lace up the sides.

2197
02:08:34,082 --> 02:08:36,500
There was a label in them
of the place I got them...

2198
02:08:36,585 --> 02:08:38,502
the Smart Shop, in Phoenix, Arizona.

2199
02:08:38,587 --> 02:08:40,504
What was the color of the panties?

2200
02:08:40,589 --> 02:08:42,506
- I believe white.
- You believe?

2201
02:08:42,591 --> 02:08:44,050
I have white and pink.
They may have been pink.

2202
02:08:44,051 --> 02:08:45,509
You're not sure?

2203
02:08:45,594 --> 02:08:48,470
Haven't you checked your lingerie
to see which pair of panties is missing?

2204
02:08:48,555 --> 02:08:49,555
No.

2205
02:08:49,639 --> 02:08:51,473
When your husband came home
late from his work...

2206
02:08:51,558 --> 02:08:54,852
and you had this little spat,
were you already dressed to go out?

2207
02:08:54,936 --> 02:08:56,770
- No.
- When did you dress?

2208
02:08:56,855 --> 02:08:58,564
After dinner, when he was asleep.

2209
02:08:58,648 --> 02:09:01,734
It's been stated here that you were
bare legged in the bar. Is that true?

2210
02:09:01,818 --> 02:09:02,860
Yes.

2211
02:09:02,944 --> 02:09:05,696
In your anger at your husband
and your haste to get out of the trailer...

2212
02:09:05,780 --> 02:09:06,844
perhaps you didn't put
on any panties either?

2213
02:09:06,845 --> 02:09:07,907
Objection.

2214
02:09:07,991 --> 02:09:10,409
The witness has already testified
as to what she was wearing.

2215
02:09:10,493 --> 02:09:13,037
- [Judge Weaver] Sustained.
- Do you always wear panties, Mrs. Manion?

2216
02:09:13,121 --> 02:09:15,873
Now, Your Honor,
I object to this line of questioning.

2217
02:09:15,957 --> 02:09:18,834
It's immaterial what
Mrs. Manion does all the time.

2218
02:09:18,919 --> 02:09:21,128
On the night she was attacked,
she was wearing panties...

2219
02:09:21,212 --> 02:09:22,838
and that's all we're concerned with.

2220
02:09:22,923 --> 02:09:25,382
Your Honor, Mrs. Manion seems
a little bit uncertain...

2221
02:09:25,467 --> 02:09:27,593
about what kind of panties
she was wearing...

2222
02:09:27,677 --> 02:09:29,595
and since these panties
have not been found...

2223
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:33,432
I submit that it's possible
she wasn't wearing any and has forgotten.

2224
02:09:33,516 --> 02:09:36,936
- That's all I'm trying to get at.
- You may answer, Mrs. Manion.

2225
02:09:38,021 --> 02:09:40,272
Do you always wear panties?

2226
02:09:41,358 --> 02:09:43,025
No.

2227
02:09:43,109 --> 02:09:46,111
On what occasions don't you wear them?
When you go out alone at night?

2228
02:09:46,196 --> 02:09:48,156
Oh, no, no. Objection.
He says he's going

2229
02:09:48,157 --> 02:09:50,115
after one thing, then
he goes after another.

2230
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:52,076
I'll sustain the objection.

2231
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:55,788
Strike out the last two questions
and Mrs. Manion's answer.

2232
02:09:55,872 --> 02:09:58,624
Now, Mr. Dancer, get off the panties.

2233
02:09:58,708 --> 02:10:02,294
- You've done enough damage.
- Yes, Your Honor.

2234
02:10:02,379 --> 02:10:06,298
Mrs. Manion, is your husband a jealous man?

2235
02:10:06,841 --> 02:10:08,405
He loves me.

2236
02:10:08,406 --> 02:10:09,969
I'm sure of that, but is
he excessively jealous?

2237
02:10:10,053 --> 02:10:12,805
Your Honor, how can the witness
answer that question?

2238
02:10:12,889 --> 02:10:14,974
What's the norm of jealousy?

2239
02:10:15,058 --> 02:10:18,060
Can you put your question a
little differently, Mr. Dancer?

2240
02:10:18,144 --> 02:10:20,187
Has your husband ever struck you
in a jealous rage?

2241
02:10:20,271 --> 02:10:22,315
No. Your Honor, I think
Mr. Dancer's fishing now.

2242
02:10:22,316 --> 02:10:24,358
What's the relevancy
of this question?

2243
02:10:24,442 --> 02:10:26,485
Your Honor,
the shoe is squeezing Mr. Biegler's foot.

2244
02:10:26,569 --> 02:10:28,779
In his own words,
this is not a high school debate...

2245
02:10:28,863 --> 02:10:30,823
this is a cross-examination
in a murder trial.

2246
02:10:30,907 --> 02:10:32,825
Proceed, Mr. Dancer.

2247
02:10:34,411 --> 02:10:36,161
Mrs. Manion...

2248
02:10:37,247 --> 02:10:40,332
did you ever go out socially
in Thunder Bay?

2249
02:10:40,417 --> 02:10:42,334
Yes, a few times.

2250
02:10:42,419 --> 02:10:44,503
When your husband's outfit
moved to Thunder Bay...

2251
02:10:44,587 --> 02:10:46,547
didn't Barney Quill throw
a cocktail party...

2252
02:10:46,631 --> 02:10:49,008
- for the officers and their wives?
- Yes.

2253
02:10:49,092 --> 02:10:52,344
Didn't your husband strike
a young second lieutenant at this party?

2254
02:10:54,097 --> 02:10:56,390
There was a little scuffle. It wasn't much.

2255
02:10:56,474 --> 02:10:59,476
- What was it about?
- I'm not sure I remember.

2256
02:10:59,561 --> 02:11:03,731
- Were you too drunk to remember?
- No, I was not.

2257
02:11:04,774 --> 02:11:07,651
I-I-I think it was because
the lieutenant...

2258
02:11:07,736 --> 02:11:10,821
was cutting in too much
when I was dancing with my husband.

2259
02:11:10,905 --> 02:11:13,073
And shortly afterwards,
on the veranda of the inn...

2260
02:11:13,158 --> 02:11:16,493
didn't your husband slap you hard enough
so that you fell against the wall?

2261
02:11:17,704 --> 02:11:21,665
- Well, h-he was drinking.
- [Dancer] Wasn't this a jealous rage?

2262
02:11:22,417 --> 02:11:25,169
- I don't know!
- Do you remember why he struck you?

2263
02:11:25,253 --> 02:11:27,171
- Yes.
- Wasn't he enraged at you...

2264
02:11:27,255 --> 02:11:29,673
because he thought you'd encouraged
this young lieutenant?

2265
02:11:29,758 --> 02:11:31,675
He might have thought so.

2266
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:33,719
Mrs. Manion,
there are witnesses to this whole affair.

2267
02:11:33,803 --> 02:11:36,013
I'll ask you again.
Wasn't this a jealous rage?

2268
02:11:36,097 --> 02:11:38,557
I guess you could call it that.

2269
02:11:39,768 --> 02:11:41,727
Now I'll ask you...

2270
02:11:43,438 --> 02:11:47,691
on the night of the shooting,
what did you swear?

2271
02:11:47,776 --> 02:11:50,235
What oath did you take on the rosary?

2272
02:11:51,279 --> 02:11:53,864
It was about Barney Quill raping me.

2273
02:11:53,948 --> 02:11:56,992
Why did you swear on the rosary
that he raped you?

2274
02:11:57,535 --> 02:12:00,120
For the reason that my husband said...
because I was hysterical.

2275
02:12:00,205 --> 02:12:02,206
That was the reason he gave
for asking you to swear.

2276
02:12:02,290 --> 02:12:04,208
- What was your reason for swearing?
- So he'd believe me.

2277
02:12:04,292 --> 02:12:06,210
- Why shouldn't he believe you?
- Objection.

2278
02:12:06,294 --> 02:12:08,545
The reason for the use of the rosary
has been established.

2279
02:12:08,630 --> 02:12:11,216
These questions are immaterial.

2280
02:12:11,217 --> 02:12:13,801
No, I think I'll take
the answer, Mr. Biegler.

2281
02:12:13,885 --> 02:12:15,719
I'll ask you again, Mrs. Manion.

2282
02:12:15,804 --> 02:12:17,930
Why shouldn't he believe you?

2283
02:12:19,265 --> 02:12:21,225
Because I wasn't making much sense.

2284
02:12:21,309 --> 02:12:23,352
Did he think you'd lie
about a thing like that?

2285
02:12:23,436 --> 02:12:25,167
Objection, Your Honor!
Lieutenant Manion has

2286
02:12:25,168 --> 02:12:26,897
already testified as
to what he thought.

2287
02:12:26,981 --> 02:12:30,609
- Sustained.
- Did your husband strike you that night?

2288
02:12:31,277 --> 02:12:33,445
Did he hit you that night?

2289
02:12:35,698 --> 02:12:37,741
Well, he... he...

2290
02:12:37,826 --> 02:12:41,370
He may have slapped me
because I was hysterical.

2291
02:12:41,454 --> 02:12:44,081
And didn't you swear to a lie to keep him
from hitting you again?

2292
02:12:44,165 --> 02:12:45,791
No! No, I didn't. I did not.

2293
02:12:45,875 --> 02:12:48,127
Hadn't he already beaten you up
at the gate when he caught you...

2294
02:12:48,211 --> 02:12:49,399
coming home from lovers'
lane with Barney Quill?

2295
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:50,587
Objection! Objection!

2296
02:12:50,672 --> 02:12:53,423
The witness has already testified
she was beaten by Barney Quill.

2297
02:12:53,508 --> 02:12:55,592
- [Spectators Murmuring]
- Quiet, quiet.

2298
02:12:55,677 --> 02:12:58,428
No more questions.

2299
02:12:58,513 --> 02:13:01,098
I think the witness has had enough,
Your Honor.

2300
02:13:01,182 --> 02:13:04,268
The witness may step down.
We'll recess for lunch.

2301
02:13:04,352 --> 02:13:06,436
[Gavel Raps]

2302
02:13:06,521 --> 02:13:08,772
[Bailiff] Recess until 1:00.

2303
02:13:08,857 --> 02:13:10,399
[Gavel Raps]

2304
02:13:11,484 --> 02:13:13,402
Sorry, baby. You were fine.

2305
02:13:13,486 --> 02:13:16,822
[Bell Clanging]

2306
02:13:46,895 --> 02:13:48,812
Dr. Smith?

2307
02:13:48,897 --> 02:13:50,814
I've come to meet you, sir.

2308
02:13:50,899 --> 02:13:53,317
- My name is...
- I'm sorry. You've made a mistake.

2309
02:13:53,401 --> 02:13:56,486
Maybe I'm the one you're looking for.
Are you Mr. Biegler?

2310
02:13:56,571 --> 02:13:58,906
No, I'm his associate in the case.

2311
02:13:59,449 --> 02:14:02,159
- Don't tell me you're Dr. Smith.
- That's me.

2312
02:14:02,243 --> 02:14:06,830
- The army psychiatrist?
- Maybe you expected me to be in uniform.

2313
02:14:06,915 --> 02:14:08,832
No. Well...

2314
02:14:08,917 --> 02:14:11,668
I didn't expect anybody so young.

2315
02:14:11,753 --> 02:14:13,670
I'm 40.

2316
02:14:13,755 --> 02:14:18,675
I sort of hoped you'd, uh, have a beard
and wear a monocle.

2317
02:14:18,760 --> 02:14:20,719
Oh, I see.

2318
02:14:21,346 --> 02:14:23,723
That better?

2319
02:14:23,724 --> 02:14:26,099
It helps.
You're on the stand this afternoon.

2320
02:14:28,603 --> 02:14:30,520
Doctor, have you formed an opinion...

2321
02:14:30,605 --> 02:14:32,522
as to Frederick Manion's
mental and emotional state...

2322
02:14:32,607 --> 02:14:34,524
at the time he killed Barney Quill?

2323
02:14:34,609 --> 02:14:36,526
- I have.
- And what is that opinion?

2324
02:14:36,611 --> 02:14:39,363
He was temporarily insane
at the time of the shooting.

2325
02:14:39,447 --> 02:14:41,365
At the time of the shooting,
do you believe...

2326
02:14:41,449 --> 02:14:43,867
he was able to distinguish
right from wrong?

2327
02:14:43,952 --> 02:14:46,870
He may or may not have been.
It doesn't make too much difference.

2328
02:14:46,955 --> 02:14:50,040
All right. Now, Doctor,
as clearly as you can...

2329
02:14:50,124 --> 02:14:54,002
will you explain Frederick Manion's
temporary insanity.

2330
02:14:54,087 --> 02:14:57,005
It is known as dissociative reaction...

2331
02:14:57,090 --> 02:15:01,718
a psychic shock which creates
an almost overwhelming tension...

2332
02:15:01,803 --> 02:15:05,055
which the person in shock must alleviate.

2333
02:15:05,139 --> 02:15:07,557
In Lieutenant Manion's case... a soldier...

2334
02:15:07,642 --> 02:15:10,394
it is only natural
that he would turn to action.

2335
02:15:10,478 --> 02:15:14,231
Only direct, simple action
against Barney Quill...

2336
02:15:14,315 --> 02:15:16,817
would relieve this unbearable tension.

2337
02:15:16,901 --> 02:15:20,028
This is not too uncommon.
For example, in combat...

2338
02:15:20,113 --> 02:15:23,490
some of the more remarkable heroics
take place in this state of mind.

2339
02:15:23,574 --> 02:15:25,639
Is there another name for
dissociative reaction,

2340
02:15:25,640 --> 02:15:27,703
one we might be more
likely to recognize?

2341
02:15:27,787 --> 02:15:31,123
Yes, it has been known
as "irresistible impulse."

2342
02:15:31,207 --> 02:15:34,251
Now, Doctor, a man in the grip
of irresistible impulse...

2343
02:15:34,335 --> 02:15:36,753
would he be likely
to go to his neighbor for advice...

2344
02:15:36,838 --> 02:15:39,715
or call up the police to come to his aid?

2345
02:15:39,799 --> 02:15:43,427
- Completely incompatible.
- Yes. But our man was able to think...

2346
02:15:43,511 --> 02:15:45,804
of going and taking out
a gun and loading it...

2347
02:15:45,888 --> 02:15:47,889
before setting out to find Quill.

2348
02:15:47,974 --> 02:15:49,808
Well, that was his conscious mind working.

2349
02:15:49,892 --> 02:15:52,394
But if no gun had been available,
he would have gone anyway.

2350
02:15:52,478 --> 02:15:55,939
How would a man look in the grip
of dissociative reaction?

2351
02:15:56,024 --> 02:16:00,277
He might appear to be deadly calm,
fiercely deliberate.

2352
02:16:00,361 --> 02:16:03,322
Mm-hmm. Would you describe
his behavior as being...

2353
02:16:03,406 --> 02:16:05,866
like a mailman delivering the mail?

2354
02:16:05,950 --> 02:16:10,162
That's not bad. Like a mailman, he would
have a job to do, and he would do it.

2355
02:16:11,497 --> 02:16:12,581
Your witness.

2356
02:16:12,665 --> 02:16:16,585
Doctor, did you find any psychosis
in Frederick Manion?

2357
02:16:16,669 --> 02:16:17,878
I did not.

2358
02:16:17,962 --> 02:16:20,964
- [Dancer] Any neuroses?
- I found no history of neuroses.

2359
02:16:21,049 --> 02:16:24,634
- [Dancer] Any history of, uh, delusion?
- None.

2360
02:16:24,719 --> 02:16:26,803
- Loss of memory?
- Not before this instance.

2361
02:16:26,888 --> 02:16:31,308
[Whispering]
Hey. Can you spot Mary Pilant?

2362
02:16:31,392 --> 02:16:33,477
She didn't come back after lunch.

2363
02:16:33,561 --> 02:16:36,313
I think you'd better give up on that one.

2364
02:16:36,397 --> 02:16:38,273
Doctor, you stated that the defendant...

2365
02:16:38,358 --> 02:16:40,318
might or might not have
been able to distinguish

2366
02:16:40,319 --> 02:16:42,277
the difference between
right and wrong...

2367
02:16:42,362 --> 02:16:43,987
but that it wouldn't have made
much difference.

2368
02:16:44,072 --> 02:16:46,448
- Am I right? Is that what you said?
- Approximately, yes.

2369
02:16:46,532 --> 02:16:48,450
Did you mean that at the time
of the shooting...

2370
02:16:48,534 --> 02:16:50,452
he could have known the difference
between right and wrong?

2371
02:16:50,536 --> 02:16:52,329
He might have, yes.

2372
02:16:52,413 --> 02:16:57,000
Dr. Smith, if the defendant
could have known what he was doing...

2373
02:16:57,085 --> 02:16:59,002
and could have known that it was wrong...

2374
02:16:59,087 --> 02:17:02,130
how can you come here and testify
that he was legally insane?

2375
02:17:02,215 --> 02:17:04,299
I'm not saying he was legally insane.

2376
02:17:04,384 --> 02:17:06,301
I'm saying that in his mental condition...

2377
02:17:06,386 --> 02:17:08,970
it would not have made any difference
whether he knew right from wrong.

2378
02:17:09,055 --> 02:17:11,056
He would still have shot Quill.

2379
02:17:12,100 --> 02:17:14,684
Dr. Smith, are you willing...

2380
02:17:14,769 --> 02:17:18,188
to rest your testimony
in this case on this opinion?

2381
02:17:18,272 --> 02:17:20,232
Yes, I am.

2382
02:17:21,442 --> 02:17:23,860
Your Honor, I'd like to
ask for a short recess.

2383
02:17:23,945 --> 02:17:25,862
The attorneys for the People
would like to meet...

2384
02:17:25,947 --> 02:17:27,094
with Mr. Biegler and
the court in chambers.

2385
02:17:27,095 --> 02:17:28,240
Mr. Biegler?

2386
02:17:28,825 --> 02:17:30,659
Glad to oblige, Your Honor.

2387
02:17:30,743 --> 02:17:33,745
Short recess. Jury will remain.

2388
02:17:45,299 --> 02:17:47,384
Someday I'm going to horrify tradition...

2389
02:17:47,468 --> 02:17:53,223
and lay a dense blue cloud of tobacco smoke
in that hallowed courtroom.

2390
02:17:53,307 --> 02:17:55,517
What's on your mind, Mr. Dancer?

2391
02:17:55,601 --> 02:17:57,519
Your Honor, in view of
Dr. Smith's testimony...

2392
02:17:57,603 --> 02:18:00,063
I thought perhaps the defense might like
to change their plea.

2393
02:18:00,148 --> 02:18:02,899
- Change it to what?
- Guilty, of course.

2394
02:18:02,984 --> 02:18:05,735
- No, we'll still go for broke.
- Hell, Polly.

2395
02:18:05,820 --> 02:18:08,071
You know a guy's not
considered legally nuts in Michigan...

2396
02:18:08,156 --> 02:18:10,073
unless he didn't know right from wrong.

2397
02:18:10,158 --> 02:18:12,347
Why don't you come on
and get this over with?

2398
02:18:12,348 --> 02:18:14,536
Your Honor, would
you turn to page 486?

2399
02:18:14,620 --> 02:18:16,246
[Lodwick] What's that?

2400
02:18:16,330 --> 02:18:18,999
Appears to be a law book, Mr. Lodwick.

2401
02:18:20,334 --> 02:18:22,252
[Chuckles]
Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor.

2402
02:18:22,336 --> 02:18:25,422
I make those things
to help me think sometimes.

2403
02:18:25,506 --> 02:18:27,841
- For perch?
- No, that one's for frog.

2404
02:18:27,925 --> 02:18:29,885
What case is he citing, Judge?

2405
02:18:29,969 --> 02:18:31,950
We gig frogs down in
my part of the country.

2406
02:18:31,951 --> 02:18:33,930
Yeah, well, it's
the same up here.

2407
02:18:34,015 --> 02:18:36,766
I'm a trout man myself,
but this is a new wrinkle I'm gonna try.

2408
02:18:36,851 --> 02:18:39,060
They do it a lot
down in the bayous down south.

2409
02:18:39,145 --> 02:18:41,062
The idea...
they get a great big long pole...

2410
02:18:41,147 --> 02:18:45,650
and about a ten-pound line, just sort
of drift along a high bank in a boat.

2411
02:18:45,735 --> 02:18:48,612
Then you see that
great big old bullfrog in a crevice...

2412
02:18:48,696 --> 02:18:51,615
and you sort of float this along
in front of him.

2413
02:18:51,699 --> 02:18:53,159
Pop! That old tongue of
his snaps out and...

2414
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:54,618
[Clicks Tongue]

2415
02:18:54,702 --> 02:18:57,287
- You've got frog's legs for supper.
- Well, I'll be darned.

2416
02:18:57,371 --> 02:19:01,625
- Why don't you keep it? Try it sometime.
- Thanks. I will.

2417
02:19:01,709 --> 02:19:03,835
486.

2418
02:19:05,087 --> 02:19:09,424
- What is it, Your Honor?
- People versus Durfee, 1886.

2419
02:19:10,051 --> 02:19:11,801
Looks like a precedent.

2420
02:19:11,886 --> 02:19:14,262
Would you like to read it, Mr. Dancer?

2421
02:19:15,223 --> 02:19:17,140
No, thank you, Your Honor.

2422
02:19:17,225 --> 02:19:19,351
I think I recall the case.

2423
02:19:19,894 --> 02:19:24,356
We're, uh, hooked... like the frog.

2424
02:19:26,901 --> 02:19:30,487
[Dancer] Dr. Harcourt, where did you
receive your university training?

2425
02:19:30,571 --> 02:19:32,489
Johns Hopkins, in Baltimore, Maryland.

2426
02:19:32,573 --> 02:19:34,783
And where do you practice now?

2427
02:19:34,867 --> 02:19:38,495
I'm the medical superintendent of the
Bonder State Hospital for the Insane.

2428
02:19:38,579 --> 02:19:43,667
It's been stated here that dissociative
reaction, or irresistible impulse...

2429
02:19:43,751 --> 02:19:46,670
is not uncommon among soldiers in combat.

2430
02:19:46,754 --> 02:19:49,339
- Do you agree with that statement?
- I do...

2431
02:19:49,423 --> 02:19:51,341
but not as it was put by Dr. Smith.

2432
02:19:51,425 --> 02:19:55,345
- Where would you depart from Dr. Smith?
- Well, dissociative reaction...

2433
02:19:55,429 --> 02:19:59,349
is not something that comes out of the blue
and disappears as quickly.

2434
02:19:59,433 --> 02:20:03,520
It can only occur...
even among soldiers in combat...

2435
02:20:03,604 --> 02:20:07,524
if the individual has a psychoneurotic
condition of long standing.

2436
02:20:07,608 --> 02:20:11,361
It's been testified here that a psychiatric
examination of the defendant...

2437
02:20:11,445 --> 02:20:14,030
showed no, um, evidence of neuroses...

2438
02:20:14,115 --> 02:20:16,533
and no history of dissociative reaction.

2439
02:20:16,617 --> 02:20:18,535
You've further heard it testified...

2440
02:20:18,619 --> 02:20:23,373
that the defendant's behavior on the night
of the shooting was cool and direct.

2441
02:20:23,457 --> 02:20:25,250
As an observer, do you
remember this testimony?

2442
02:20:25,251 --> 02:20:27,043
Yes.

2443
02:20:27,128 --> 02:20:29,045
From this, have you formed an opinion...

2444
02:20:29,130 --> 02:20:31,881
about the defendant's sanity
on the night of the shooting?

2445
02:20:31,966 --> 02:20:36,386
Yes. I'm of the opinion that he was in
sufficient possession of his faculties...

2446
02:20:36,470 --> 02:20:39,222
so that he was not dominated
by his unconscious mind.

2447
02:20:39,307 --> 02:20:42,892
In other words, he was not in the
grip of irresistible impulse?

2448
02:20:42,977 --> 02:20:44,311
In my opinion, he was not.

2449
02:20:44,312 --> 02:20:45,645
Thank you, Doctor.
Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

2450
02:20:45,730 --> 02:20:48,732
Dr. Harcourt, psychiatry
is an effort to probe...

2451
02:20:48,816 --> 02:20:51,568
into the dark, undiscovered
world of the mind.

2452
02:20:51,652 --> 02:20:55,071
And in there, the world might
be round, it could be square.

2453
02:20:55,156 --> 02:20:58,033
Your opinion could be wrong.
Dr. Smith's opinion could be right.

2454
02:20:58,117 --> 02:20:59,848
Isn't that true?

2455
02:20:59,849 --> 02:21:01,578
I'd be a poor doctor if I
didn't agree with that...

2456
02:21:01,662 --> 02:21:05,081
but I believe my opinion to be right.

2457
02:21:05,166 --> 02:21:07,459
Now, do you think you might have
changed your opinion...

2458
02:21:07,543 --> 02:21:10,462
if you had examined the defendant,
as Dr. Smith did?

2459
02:21:11,130 --> 02:21:12,714
I don't believe so.

2460
02:21:12,798 --> 02:21:15,884
But Dr. Smith's opinion was made under
better circumstances, wasn't it?

2461
02:21:15,968 --> 02:21:19,012
If you mean that he was able
to examine the man, yes.

2462
02:21:19,096 --> 02:21:20,930
Yeah. Well, thank you, Doctor.

2463
02:21:21,015 --> 02:21:24,267
That's all, Dr. Harcourt.
ls there more rebuttal?

2464
02:21:24,352 --> 02:21:26,603
We're over a barrel, Mitch.

2465
02:21:26,687 --> 02:21:28,813
We have to use him.

2466
02:21:29,357 --> 02:21:31,900
We call Duane Miller to the stand.

2467
02:21:31,984 --> 02:21:34,152
Will the sheriff please
bring in the witness?

2468
02:21:40,534 --> 02:21:42,494
What can he tell?

2469
02:21:43,204 --> 02:21:44,704
Nothing.

2470
02:21:45,706 --> 02:21:47,666
He can't tell anything.

2471
02:21:58,469 --> 02:22:00,095
Raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear

2472
02:22:00,096 --> 02:22:01,721
the testimony you shall
give in this cause...

2473
02:22:01,806 --> 02:22:05,350
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

2474
02:22:05,434 --> 02:22:07,018
I do.

2475
02:22:08,729 --> 02:22:11,648
- Would you state your name, please.
- Duane Miller.

2476
02:22:11,732 --> 02:22:13,525
Most folks call me Duke.

2477
02:22:13,526 --> 02:22:15,318
Where do you presently
reside, Mr. Miller?

2478
02:22:15,403 --> 02:22:17,320
Across the alley in the jail.

2479
02:22:17,405 --> 02:22:19,239
You know the defendant, Frederick Manion?

2480
02:22:19,323 --> 02:22:21,033
Yeah, I got to know him
in the past few weeks.

2481
02:22:21,034 --> 02:22:22,742
His cell's right next to mine.

2482
02:22:22,827 --> 02:22:25,245
When was the last conversation
you had with the lieutenant?

2483
02:22:25,329 --> 02:22:29,040
Except for "hello" this morning,
the last time was last night.

2484
02:22:29,125 --> 02:22:32,544
- Did you discuss his trial last night?
- Yeah, some.

2485
02:22:32,628 --> 02:22:35,880
Would you tell the court what Lieutenant
Manion had to say about the trial?

2486
02:22:35,965 --> 02:22:39,551
Well, I said, uh,
"Things looking up, Lieutenant?"

2487
02:22:39,635 --> 02:22:42,554
And he said, "I got it made, buster."

2488
02:22:42,638 --> 02:22:46,891
He said, "I fooled my lawyer.
I fooled that headshrinker.

2489
02:22:46,976 --> 02:22:49,686
I'm gonna fool that bunch
of corn cobbers on the jury."

2490
02:22:49,770 --> 02:22:52,689
You're a liar!
You're a lousy, stinkin' liar!

2491
02:22:52,773 --> 02:22:54,774
[Whispers] Come on. Come on.

2492
02:22:54,859 --> 02:22:56,401
Take it easy.

2493
02:22:57,361 --> 02:23:00,363
I apologize for my client, Your Honor.

2494
02:23:00,448 --> 02:23:02,365
Yet his outburst is almost excusable...

2495
02:23:02,450 --> 02:23:05,368
since the prosecution
has seen fit to put a felon on the stand...

2496
02:23:05,453 --> 02:23:07,746
to testify against an officer
in the United States Army.

2497
02:23:07,830 --> 02:23:12,459
Your Honor, I don't know who is
the worse offender, Manion or his lawyer.

2498
02:23:12,543 --> 02:23:14,544
We're close to the end.

2499
02:23:14,628 --> 02:23:20,258
In the name of heaven, let's have peace
and courtesy for these last few hours.

2500
02:23:20,342 --> 02:23:25,388
Mr. Dancer, you will continue
your interrogation without comment.

2501
02:23:25,473 --> 02:23:28,391
Mr. Biegler, you will not
sound off at every opportunity...

2502
02:23:28,476 --> 02:23:31,561
and the defendant will remain seated
in his chair and keep his mouth shut.

2503
02:23:31,645 --> 02:23:34,063
- Now go ahead.
- Mr. Miller...

2504
02:23:34,148 --> 02:23:36,733
are you certain that
Lieutenant Manion said...

2505
02:23:36,817 --> 02:23:40,236
- "I've got it made, buster"?
- That's what he said.

2506
02:23:40,321 --> 02:23:42,405
Mr. Miller,
did Lieutenant Manion say anything else?

2507
02:23:42,490 --> 02:23:44,574
Yes, sir. He said when he got out...

2508
02:23:44,658 --> 02:23:49,120
the first thing he was gonna do was to
kick that bitch from here to kingdom come.

2509
02:23:50,372 --> 02:23:53,166
- [Dancer] To whom was he referring?
- To his wife.

2510
02:23:54,126 --> 02:23:55,794
Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

2511
02:23:56,629 --> 02:23:58,421
What are you in jail for, Mr. Miller?

2512
02:23:58,506 --> 02:24:01,090
Arson. I copped out,
and I'm waiting for a sentence.

2513
02:24:01,175 --> 02:24:03,384
And how many other offenses
have you committed?

2514
02:24:03,469 --> 02:24:06,805
Well, I was in reform school when
I was a kid, but that's all.

2515
02:24:07,348 --> 02:24:09,933
Your Honor,
I'd like to see this man's criminal record.

2516
02:24:10,017 --> 02:24:12,060
Do you have his record, Mr. Lodwick?

2517
02:24:12,144 --> 02:24:13,645
Yes, sir.

2518
02:24:14,355 --> 02:24:16,314
Here it is.

2519
02:24:18,859 --> 02:24:20,777
Well, your record here
shows you've been in prison...

2520
02:24:20,861 --> 02:24:23,655
six times in three different states.

2521
02:24:24,365 --> 02:24:26,282
You were in three times for arson...

2522
02:24:26,367 --> 02:24:30,078
twice for assault with a deadly weapon,
once for larceny.

2523
02:24:30,871 --> 02:24:34,958
Yeah. Also shows you've done
short stretches in four city jails...

2524
02:24:35,042 --> 02:24:38,795
on charges of indecent exposure,
window peeping...

2525
02:24:38,879 --> 02:24:42,090
perjury and disorderly conduct.

2526
02:24:42,883 --> 02:24:44,926
Is this your true record?

2527
02:24:45,553 --> 02:24:47,637
Them things are never right.

2528
02:24:47,721 --> 02:24:50,974
How did you get the ear of the prosecution
in order to tell them...

2529
02:24:51,058 --> 02:24:53,476
about this conversation you had
with Lieutenant Manion?

2530
02:24:53,561 --> 02:24:56,521
- The D.A. was taking us to his office.
- Taking who to his office?

2531
02:24:56,605 --> 02:24:58,211
Us prisoners in the jail.

2532
02:24:58,212 --> 02:24:59,816
He take you all at
once, or one at a time?

2533
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:01,818
One at a time.

2534
02:25:01,902 --> 02:25:04,153
Him and that other lawyer
took us to his office...

2535
02:25:04,238 --> 02:25:06,990
and asked us questions
about Lieutenant Manion.

2536
02:25:07,074 --> 02:25:09,409
Were you promised a lighter sentence
if you came over here...

2537
02:25:09,493 --> 02:25:12,120
- and went on the witness stand?
- [Dancer] Your Honor, the People object...

2538
02:25:12,204 --> 02:25:13,830
Overruled. Answer the question.

2539
02:25:13,914 --> 02:25:15,832
- I wasn't promised anything.
- Oh, you just thought...

2540
02:25:15,916 --> 02:25:19,502
it would help your own troubles if you
dreamed up this story to please the D.A.?

2541
02:25:19,587 --> 02:25:21,046
I didn't dream up nothin'.

2542
02:25:21,047 --> 02:25:22,505
You're sure that's what
Lieutenant Manion said?

2543
02:25:22,590 --> 02:25:24,216
Yeah, I'm sure.

2544
02:25:24,217 --> 02:25:25,842
Just as sure as you were
about your criminal record?

2545
02:25:25,926 --> 02:25:29,053
Well, I guess I kind of goofed on that one.

2546
02:25:30,931 --> 02:25:36,185
Your Honor, I don't feel I can dignify
this creature with any more questions.

2547
02:25:36,270 --> 02:25:38,313
Take the witness away.

2548
02:25:38,397 --> 02:25:40,857
Mr. Biegler, would you
like a conference with your client?

2549
02:25:40,941 --> 02:25:44,027
I can see how the last witness
was quite a surprise.

2550
02:25:44,111 --> 02:25:46,529
No, Your Honor.
We don't need a conference.

2551
02:25:46,614 --> 02:25:49,407
I'll recall Lieutenant Manion
to the stand right now.

2552
02:25:57,458 --> 02:26:00,919
Now you've heard the
testimony of this Miller.

2553
02:26:01,629 --> 02:26:03,379
Is any part of it true?

2554
02:26:03,464 --> 02:26:04,964
None.

2555
02:26:05,466 --> 02:26:09,969
Lieutenant, do you have any idea why he
might come here with a tale like that?

2556
02:26:10,054 --> 02:26:11,596
No, sir.

2557
02:26:13,307 --> 02:26:15,558
Have you ever talked with this man?

2558
02:26:15,643 --> 02:26:17,060
Yes.

2559
02:26:17,603 --> 02:26:19,354
And what did you talk about?

2560
02:26:21,315 --> 02:26:23,399
Nothing important.

2561
02:26:23,484 --> 02:26:25,381
Certainly nothing...

2562
02:26:25,382 --> 02:26:27,278
nothing about my personal
life or my feelings.

2563
02:26:27,988 --> 02:26:29,572
That's all I wanted to know.

2564
02:26:29,657 --> 02:26:31,324
Lieutenant Manion...

2565
02:26:32,326 --> 02:26:35,244
have you ever had any sort of...

2566
02:26:35,329 --> 02:26:37,789
trouble with, uh, Miller?

2567
02:26:38,749 --> 02:26:41,542
I don't know. What do you mean?
An argument? Something like that?

2568
02:26:41,627 --> 02:26:46,130
Well, did you ever, um, attack Miller...
physically attack him?

2569
02:26:46,757 --> 02:26:49,300
Your lawyer can't answer the
question for you, Lieutenant.

2570
02:26:49,385 --> 02:26:51,302
Did you ever physically attack Miller?

2571
02:26:51,387 --> 02:26:53,972
Well, I wouldn't call it an attack exactly.

2572
02:26:54,056 --> 02:26:55,599
I pushed his head
against the bars one day.

2573
02:26:55,600 --> 02:26:57,141
Why?

2574
02:26:57,226 --> 02:26:59,310
He said something ugly about my wife.

2575
02:26:59,395 --> 02:27:03,022
And do you remember, uh, pushing or
bumping his head against the bars?

2576
02:27:03,107 --> 02:27:05,274
Well, sure. I just told you.

2577
02:27:05,359 --> 02:27:07,652
Then this was not dissociative reaction?

2578
02:27:07,736 --> 02:27:09,112
The defendant isn't
qualified to answer that.

2579
02:27:09,113 --> 02:27:10,488
[Judge Weaver] Sustained.

2580
02:27:10,572 --> 02:27:14,325
Lieutenant Manion,
wasn't your action against Barney Quill...

2581
02:27:14,410 --> 02:27:16,327
much the same as your
action against Miller...

2582
02:27:16,412 --> 02:27:19,998
and against the lieutenant
that you struck at the cocktail party...

2583
02:27:20,082 --> 02:27:24,502
all in the heat of anger, with a willful,
conscious desire to hurt or kill?

2584
02:27:24,586 --> 02:27:27,171
I don't remember my action against Quill.

2585
02:27:28,257 --> 02:27:31,843
How long had you known your wife
was running around with Barney Quill?

2586
02:27:33,262 --> 02:27:35,263
I never knew anything like that.

2587
02:27:36,223 --> 02:27:37,849
I trust my wife.

2588
02:27:38,684 --> 02:27:41,519
I suppose you just beat her up occasionally
just for the fun of it.

2589
02:27:41,603 --> 02:27:45,023
Nothing has been established
to permit a question like that.

2590
02:27:45,107 --> 02:27:47,358
He keeps implying things
without ever getting to the point.

2591
02:27:47,443 --> 02:27:50,695
Let him ask the lieutenant,
did he ever beat his wife.

2592
02:27:50,779 --> 02:27:52,739
[Judge Weaver]
I'll sustain the objection.

2593
02:27:52,823 --> 02:27:55,700
Would you like to rephrase
your question, Mr. Dancer?

2594
02:27:56,952 --> 02:27:58,870
No, thank you, Your Honor.

2595
02:27:59,455 --> 02:28:01,372
I've finished.

2596
02:28:01,457 --> 02:28:05,460
Well, then I'll ask him. Did you,
Lieutenant Manion, ever beat your wife...

2597
02:28:05,544 --> 02:28:07,795
on the night of the shooting,
or at any other time?

2598
02:28:07,880 --> 02:28:09,881
- No, sir.
- Is there any doubt in your mind...

2599
02:28:09,965 --> 02:28:12,258
that Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2600
02:28:12,342 --> 02:28:13,801
- No, sir.
- That's all.

2601
02:28:13,886 --> 02:28:15,887
Step down, Lieutenant.

2602
02:28:22,061 --> 02:28:24,562
- Are we hurt?
- We're hurt bad.

2603
02:28:24,646 --> 02:28:26,564
[Whispering] Paul.

2604
02:28:26,648 --> 02:28:28,566
[Whispering]

2605
02:28:30,152 --> 02:28:32,111
Your Honor, I know time is very pressing.

2606
02:28:32,196 --> 02:28:34,113
I don't want to ask for a recess.

2607
02:28:34,198 --> 02:28:36,240
I would like to leave
the courtroom for a moment.

2608
02:28:36,325 --> 02:28:38,910
If it's important,
we can be at ease for a minute.

2609
02:28:38,994 --> 02:28:40,495
Thank you, sir.

2610
02:28:41,663 --> 02:28:43,915
This is highly irregular, Your Honor.

2611
02:28:43,999 --> 02:28:47,085
Well, there's no reason
to make a federal case out of it.

2612
02:28:57,971 --> 02:28:59,889
Thank you very much, Your Honor.

2613
02:28:59,973 --> 02:29:02,058
We now have another rebuttal witness.

2614
02:29:02,142 --> 02:29:04,227
The defense calls Mary Pilant to the stand.

2615
02:29:04,311 --> 02:29:06,395
Your Honor, we must protest
this whole affair.

2616
02:29:06,480 --> 02:29:09,398
The noble defense attorney
rushes out to a secret conference...

2617
02:29:09,483 --> 02:29:12,527
and now the last-minute witness is being
brought dramatically down the aisle.

2618
02:29:12,611 --> 02:29:15,863
The whole thing has obviously been rigged
to unduly excite the jury.

2619
02:29:15,948 --> 02:29:18,074
It's just another one
of Mr. Biegler's cornball tricks.

2620
02:29:18,158 --> 02:29:21,410
Your Honor, I don't blame
Mr. Dancer for feeling put upon.

2621
02:29:21,495 --> 02:29:24,413
I'm just a humble country lawyer
trying to do the best I can...

2622
02:29:24,498 --> 02:29:28,126
against this brilliant prosecutor
from the big city of Lansing.

2623
02:29:28,210 --> 02:29:29,961
Swear the witness.

2624
02:29:30,504 --> 02:29:32,421
Raise your right hand, please.

2625
02:29:32,506 --> 02:29:34,924
You do solemnly swear the testimony
you shall give in this cause...

2626
02:29:35,008 --> 02:29:38,427
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

2627
02:29:38,512 --> 02:29:40,471
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

2628
02:29:43,225 --> 02:29:44,934
Where do you live, Miss Pilant?

2629
02:29:45,018 --> 02:29:46,894
At the Thunder Bay Inn, in Thunder Bay.

2630
02:29:46,979 --> 02:29:50,106
- And how long have you lived there?
- For two years.

2631
02:29:50,190 --> 02:29:53,025
- And what's your profession?
- I manage the inn.

2632
02:29:53,110 --> 02:29:57,613
Now, Miss Pilant, how is the laundry
handled at Thunder Bay Inn?

2633
02:29:57,698 --> 02:29:59,615
It's chuted down to the laundry room.

2634
02:29:59,700 --> 02:30:02,451
Where is the location of that chute
on the second floor?

2635
02:30:02,536 --> 02:30:06,122
- Between room 42 and 43.
- Who lives in those rooms?

2636
02:30:06,206 --> 02:30:09,959
I live in 42. Mr. Quill lived in 43.

2637
02:30:10,043 --> 02:30:12,628
Now, would Mr. Quill,
coming up from the lobby...

2638
02:30:12,713 --> 02:30:16,757
have to pass by the mouth of that chute
on the way to his room?

2639
02:30:16,842 --> 02:30:17,508
Yes.

2640
02:30:17,593 --> 02:30:21,095
Would it be very easy for him to drop
something into that chute as he passed by?

2641
02:30:21,180 --> 02:30:22,138
Yes.

2642
02:30:22,222 --> 02:30:25,892
Have you ever had occasion to go down
into the laundry at any time?

2643
02:30:25,976 --> 02:30:29,520
Yes. Part of my job is to sort
various pieces of laundry...

2644
02:30:29,605 --> 02:30:31,981
as they come out of
the wash-and-dry machine.

2645
02:30:32,065 --> 02:30:33,983
Would you tell the court what you found...

2646
02:30:34,067 --> 02:30:37,486
among those pieces of laundry
on the day after Mr. Quill was killed?

2647
02:30:37,571 --> 02:30:39,822
I found a pair of women's panties.

2648
02:30:39,907 --> 02:30:43,201
- What did you do with them?
- I threw them in the rag bin.

2649
02:30:43,285 --> 02:30:46,662
When did you learn
the significance of those panties?

2650
02:30:46,747 --> 02:30:49,123
Here. This morning in the courtroom.

2651
02:30:49,208 --> 02:30:51,834
And then you went home
and got them out of the rag bin?

2652
02:30:51,919 --> 02:30:53,669
- Yes.
- Did you bring them with you?

2653
02:30:53,754 --> 02:30:55,254
Yes.

2654
02:30:57,257 --> 02:31:00,676
I offer this article of lingerie...

2655
02:31:00,761 --> 02:31:03,179
as exhibit number one for the defense.

2656
02:31:03,263 --> 02:31:06,891
They're white,
they have lace up the side...

2657
02:31:07,935 --> 02:31:09,852
and they're badly torn...

2658
02:31:09,937 --> 02:31:13,689
as if they'd been ripped apart
by powerful hands.

2659
02:31:13,774 --> 02:31:15,733
The label reads...

2660
02:31:16,944 --> 02:31:19,946
"Smart Shop, Phoenix, Arizona."

2661
02:31:20,030 --> 02:31:23,282
If there is no objection,
the exhibit will be received in evidence.

2662
02:31:23,367 --> 02:31:24,367
That's all, Miss Pilant.

2663
02:31:24,451 --> 02:31:26,119
Did you ever talk to Mr.
Lodwick, the prosecuting

2664
02:31:26,120 --> 02:31:27,787
attorney, about the
death of Barney Quill?

2665
02:31:27,871 --> 02:31:31,290
Yes. He came to the hotel several times
after Mr. Quill was killed.

2666
02:31:31,375 --> 02:31:34,710
Did you tell Mr. Lodwick that you didn't
believe Barney Quill had raped Mrs. Manion?

2667
02:31:34,795 --> 02:31:36,837
- Yes, I told him that.
- Now, Miss Pilant...

2668
02:31:36,922 --> 02:31:39,048
did you ever talk to Mr. Biegler,
the defense attorney?

2669
02:31:39,132 --> 02:31:39,840
Yes.

2670
02:31:39,925 --> 02:31:42,260
Was this also in connection with
the shooting of Quill? - Yes.

2671
02:31:42,344 --> 02:31:44,845
Did you tell him you didn't believe
Barney Quill had raped Mrs. Manion?

2672
02:31:44,930 --> 02:31:45,510
Yes.

2673
02:31:45,511 --> 02:31:46,889
How many times did you
talk to Mr. Biegler?

2674
02:31:46,974 --> 02:31:48,891
- Twice.
- When was the last time?

2675
02:31:48,976 --> 02:31:51,394
- Last night.
- And have you now changed your mind?

2676
02:31:51,478 --> 02:31:54,063
Do you now believe
Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2677
02:31:54,147 --> 02:31:56,732
I... I don't know now.
I think he might have.

2678
02:31:56,817 --> 02:31:58,734
When did you change your mind?
Last night?

2679
02:31:58,819 --> 02:32:00,736
No. No, it was here, this morning.

2680
02:32:00,821 --> 02:32:02,863
When were you given the panties?
Was that last night?

2681
02:32:02,948 --> 02:32:05,075
Now wait a minute!
Now just wait a minute.

2682
02:32:05,076 --> 02:32:07,201
Use the proper form of
objection, Mr. Biegler.

2683
02:32:07,286 --> 02:32:09,245
No, on second thought,
I don't object, Your Honor.

2684
02:32:09,329 --> 02:32:11,372
I'd like the jury to hear her answer.

2685
02:32:11,456 --> 02:32:13,749
- The witness may answer.
- No.

2686
02:32:13,834 --> 02:32:16,460
I was not given the panties,
last night or at any other time.

2687
02:32:16,545 --> 02:32:18,504
I found them exactly as I said.

2688
02:32:18,588 --> 02:32:21,590
Do you know for a fact that Barney Quill
dropped the panties down the chute...

2689
02:32:21,675 --> 02:32:23,592
- or did you just assume it?
- I assumed it.

2690
02:32:23,677 --> 02:32:26,304
Had you thought that perhaps someone
else might have put the panties there...

2691
02:32:26,388 --> 02:32:27,827
someone who wanted them
found in the laundry?

2692
02:32:27,828 --> 02:32:29,265
I hadn't thought of that.

2693
02:32:29,349 --> 02:32:33,769
Mm-hmm. And in the grip of what Mr. Biegler
might call irresistible impulse...

2694
02:32:33,854 --> 02:32:35,771
you rushed in here with the panties...

2695
02:32:35,856 --> 02:32:38,274
because you wanted to crucify the character
of the dead Barney Quill.

2696
02:32:38,358 --> 02:32:40,443
- Isn't that true?
- No. I thought it was my duty.

2697
02:32:40,527 --> 02:32:43,404
- Your pride was hurt, wasn't it?
- I don't know what you mean.

2698
02:32:43,488 --> 02:32:45,364
Your Honor, he's trying
to confuse the witness.

2699
02:32:45,449 --> 02:32:47,700
Let him ask her a question
she can understand.

2700
02:32:47,784 --> 02:32:51,662
Yes, Mr. Dancer, I myself
would like to know what you're driving at.

2701
02:32:51,747 --> 02:32:54,999
Miss Pilant, when you found the panties...

2702
02:32:55,083 --> 02:32:58,669
was your first thought that Barney Quill
might have raped Mrs. Manion...

2703
02:32:58,754 --> 02:33:02,590
or was it that he might
have been stepping out with Mrs. Manion?

2704
02:33:02,674 --> 02:33:04,717
What does he mean?
I don't know what he means.

2705
02:33:04,801 --> 02:33:06,844
Mr. Dancer, once again I must ask you...

2706
02:33:06,928 --> 02:33:09,680
to put straight questions to the witness.

2707
02:33:09,765 --> 02:33:12,099
Here is a straight question, Your Honor.

2708
02:33:12,934 --> 02:33:15,186
Miss Pilant, were you
Barney Quill's mistress?

2709
02:33:15,187 --> 02:33:17,438
No! No, I was not!

2710
02:33:17,522 --> 02:33:20,066
You know it's common knowledge
in Thunder Bay you were living with Quill?

2711
02:33:20,150 --> 02:33:21,984
That's not true! Barney Quill was...

2712
02:33:22,069 --> 02:33:24,362
Was what, Miss Pilant?

2713
02:33:24,446 --> 02:33:26,697
Barney Quill was what, Miss Pilant?

2714
02:33:28,617 --> 02:33:30,701
Barney Quill was my father.

2715
02:33:30,786 --> 02:33:32,703
[Spectators Murmuring]

2716
02:33:42,798 --> 02:33:44,715
No more questions, Your Honor.

2717
02:33:44,800 --> 02:33:46,884
That's all for me.

2718
02:33:47,761 --> 02:33:50,054
The witness may step down.

2719
02:33:50,138 --> 02:33:52,056
We will recess for 15 minutes...

2720
02:33:52,140 --> 02:33:55,226
after which we will hear
the closing arguments.

2721
02:33:55,310 --> 02:33:59,563
If possible, I would like
to charge the jury before nightfall.

2722
02:34:03,819 --> 02:34:05,736
## [Piano: Jazz]

2723
02:34:14,996 --> 02:34:17,415
Think they're gonna stay out all night?

2724
02:34:32,514 --> 02:34:35,141
Can't somebody say something?

2725
02:34:37,018 --> 02:34:39,437
What do you want me to say, Maida, darling?

2726
02:34:39,521 --> 02:34:41,605
Tell me we're gonna win.

2727
02:34:42,941 --> 02:34:46,777
I'm counting on getting
that promissory note from the lieutenant.

2728
02:34:46,862 --> 02:34:48,779
I hope we can borrow some money on it.

2729
02:34:48,864 --> 02:34:51,282
I need a new typewriter.

2730
02:34:51,366 --> 02:34:54,785
Half the time the "P" and the "F"
don't strike on mine.

2731
02:34:55,370 --> 02:34:59,999
"Party of the first part"
sometimes comes out "arty of the irst art."

2732
02:35:00,834 --> 02:35:03,544
Doesn't make sense.
It's embarrassing.

2733
02:35:03,628 --> 02:35:05,963
"Arty of the irst art"?

2734
02:35:06,047 --> 02:35:08,132
I kind of like that.

2735
02:35:08,216 --> 02:35:10,134
It has a ring to it.

2736
02:35:13,221 --> 02:35:16,307
Twelve people go off into a room.

2737
02:35:17,476 --> 02:35:21,645
Twelve different minds,
12 different hearts...

2738
02:35:21,730 --> 02:35:24,565
from 12 different walks of life.

2739
02:35:25,233 --> 02:35:28,986
Twelve sets of eyes,
ears, shapes and sizes.

2740
02:35:29,654 --> 02:35:31,989
And these 12 people...

2741
02:35:32,073 --> 02:35:35,159
are asked to judge another human being...

2742
02:35:35,243 --> 02:35:38,746
as different from them
as they are from each other.

2743
02:35:38,830 --> 02:35:43,834
And in their judgment they must become
of one mind... unanimous.

2744
02:35:45,545 --> 02:35:49,882
It's one of the miracles of man's
disorganized soul that they can do it.

2745
02:35:50,509 --> 02:35:53,010
And in most instances, do it right well.

2746
02:35:54,763 --> 02:35:57,723
God bless juries.

2747
02:35:58,975 --> 02:36:01,685
I don't know what I'd do
if I were on that jury.

2748
02:36:05,273 --> 02:36:07,816
I really don't know.

2749
02:36:08,693 --> 02:36:09,860
Do you?

02:36:14,449 --> 02:36:16,534
I loved that, Polly.

2752
02:36:16,618 --> 02:36:19,745
I loved that "humble country lawyer" bit.

2753
02:36:19,829 --> 02:36:23,207
[Laughing]
You had Mr. Dancer dancing.

2754
02:36:23,959 --> 02:36:25,709
I'm afraid he got in the last dance.

2755
02:36:25,794 --> 02:36:28,254
That's the best summary
I've ever heard in a courtroom.

2756
02:36:28,338 --> 02:36:30,881
I liked yours much better, Polly.

2757
02:36:35,971 --> 02:36:37,888
Do you have to play that stuff?

2758
02:36:37,973 --> 02:36:41,225
Can't you play "Danny Boy,"
or "Sweet Isle of Innisfree"?

2759
02:36:41,309 --> 02:36:44,228
## ["Danny Boy" In Upbeat, Jazzy Style]

2760
02:36:48,650 --> 02:36:50,568
[Phone Ringing]

2761
02:36:55,323 --> 02:36:57,241
Paul Biegler's office.

2762
02:36:57,325 --> 02:36:59,410
Yes, sir. Right away.

2763
02:36:59,494 --> 02:37:01,412
- [Handset Settles In Cradle]
- They're ready.

2764
02:37:11,172 --> 02:37:13,090
[Laura] Hey, sweetie!

2765
02:37:14,342 --> 02:37:16,594
Go on, go on.

2766
02:37:16,678 --> 02:37:19,430
- The jury's coming in.
- Yeah, I heard.

2767
02:37:19,514 --> 02:37:22,600
You can tell my lovin' husband
I'll be waiting in the car.

2768
02:37:22,684 --> 02:37:25,102
- You're sure he's gonna come out?
- Oh, sure.

2769
02:37:25,186 --> 02:37:27,104
[Giggles] He's lucky.

2770
02:37:27,188 --> 02:37:29,440
Some people have all the luck.

2771
02:37:29,524 --> 02:37:33,777
You can tell him I'm waiting
to get kicked to kingdom come.

2772
02:37:33,862 --> 02:37:37,615
Oh. Hey, sweetie, I have
a souvenir for you.

2773
02:37:37,699 --> 02:37:39,783
[Chuckles]

2774
02:37:39,868 --> 02:37:43,621
Well, now, you better keep that.
You might need it again sometime.

2775
02:37:43,705 --> 02:37:46,957
- You never know.
- No, you don't, do you?

2776
02:37:47,042 --> 02:37:48,959
Oh, I like you, Polly.

2777
02:37:55,925 --> 02:37:59,720
I warn all those present
not to interrupt the taking of the verdict.

2778
02:37:59,804 --> 02:38:02,473
I will stop the proceedings
and clear the courtroom...

2779
02:38:02,557 --> 02:38:04,975
if there is any demonstration.

2780
02:38:13,735 --> 02:38:15,319
Proceed, Mr. Clerk.

2781
02:38:15,904 --> 02:38:20,074
Members of the jury, have you agreed upon a
verdict, and if so, who will speak for you?

2782
02:38:20,158 --> 02:38:22,076
We have. I'm the foreman.

2783
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:23,994
[Judge Weaver]
The defendant will rise.

2784
02:38:26,414 --> 02:38:28,332
What is your verdict?

2785
02:38:28,416 --> 02:38:31,168
We find the defendant not guilty
by reason of insanity.

2786
02:38:31,252 --> 02:38:35,506
- [Spectators Cheering]
- [Gavel Rapping]

2787
02:38:37,425 --> 02:38:39,677
Maida gave you that promissory note,
didn't she?

2788
02:38:39,761 --> 02:38:43,347
Right here,
ready to be signed by our happy client.

2789
02:38:43,431 --> 02:38:47,351
You know, I used to think the world
looked better through a glass of whiskey.

2790
02:38:47,435 --> 02:38:49,520
It doesn't.

2791
02:38:49,604 --> 02:38:51,522
I think I'll keep it this way.

2792
02:38:51,606 --> 02:38:53,107
Looks nice.

2793
02:38:53,775 --> 02:38:56,527
Well, I got one good thing
out of this case...

2794
02:38:57,529 --> 02:39:00,823
a new law partner,
if it's all right with him.

2795
02:39:01,449 --> 02:39:05,202
He'd be mighty proud to have his name
on a shingle with yours.

2796
02:39:34,983 --> 02:39:37,234
I guess you're looking for Lieutenant
Manion, aren't you, Mr. Biegler?

2797
02:39:37,318 --> 02:39:39,903
- Yeah.
- He gave me this note for you.

2798
02:39:41,823 --> 02:39:45,325
Felt real sorry for Mrs. Manion.
She was crying.

2799
02:39:45,827 --> 02:39:47,745
Left a mess, didn't they?

2800
02:39:47,829 --> 02:39:49,747
Well, we'd better get busy here.

2801
02:39:49,831 --> 02:39:53,584
"Dear Mr. Biegler.
So sorry, but I had to leave suddenly.

2802
02:39:53,668 --> 02:39:58,255
I was seized by an irresistible impulse.
Frederick Manion."

2803
02:39:59,591 --> 02:40:02,259
Now, how in the world
are we gonna face Maida?

2804
02:40:03,344 --> 02:40:05,262
Gin.

2805
02:40:05,346 --> 02:40:07,765
I knew there was something
wrong with that guy.

2806
02:40:07,849 --> 02:40:10,601
Never saw a gin drinker
yet you could trust.

2807
02:40:11,686 --> 02:40:14,772
Well, partner, what do you say
we go and see our first client?

2808
02:40:14,856 --> 02:40:16,940
- Who might that be?
- Mary Pilant.

2809
02:40:17,025 --> 02:40:19,443
We're gonna administer
Barney Quill's estate.

2810
02:40:19,527 --> 02:40:23,113
Now that's what I call
poetic justice for everybody.

2811
02:40:24,866 --> 02:40:26,366
Yeah.
