1
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:18,424
Are we still partners?

2
00:00:20,383 --> 00:00:22,634
We've been business partners
for nearly three years.

3
00:00:23,385 --> 00:00:25,511
This is the first time
we've ever sat together.

4
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:28,053
We hardly ever see each other.

5
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:31,221
l know how hard it is for a man
to control his passion.

6
00:00:31,596 --> 00:00:33,972
Partners shouldn't get emotionally
involved with each other.

7
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:04,810
Fallen Angels

8
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:05,686
Paging 3662.

9
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:07,061
l'd like to leave a message.

10
00:04:07,145 --> 00:04:08,479
l'll meet his friends tomorrow.

11
00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:10,813
Where and when?

12
00:04:27,987 --> 00:04:30,488
Most people work from 9 to 5.

13
00:04:30,905 --> 00:04:32,905
l'm the opposite.

14
00:04:33,364 --> 00:04:36,157
My job is simple.

15
00:04:36,157 --> 00:04:39,325
l visit friends now and again.

16
00:04:39,658 --> 00:04:42,618
l don't know any ofthese people.

17
00:04:42,826 --> 00:04:44,952
They don't interest me, either.

18
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,328
Soon, they'll be history.

19
00:06:28,203 --> 00:06:30,538
- Going out?
- Yes.

20
00:06:35,123 --> 00:06:38,166
One's profession is very often
determined by one's personality.

21
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:41,292
l love my job...
no decision making.

22
00:06:43,793 --> 00:06:47,461
Like who's to die, where and
when - is all planned by others.

23
00:06:48,462 --> 00:06:52,380
l'm a lazy person. l like others
to arrange things for me.

24
00:06:52,672 --> 00:06:54,131
That's why l need a partner.

25
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:27,236
Ming?

26
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:30,613
Ming

27
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,656
lt is Ming, isn't it?

28
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,157
Remember me? l'm Hoi.

29
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,825
Remember? We were in the same
class at junior high

30
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:41,826
Yes...

31
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:43,285
What a coincidence

32
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:46,286
lf my Merc hadn't broken down.
we wouldn't have met

33
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:48,704
Everyone has a past.

34
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,580
Even an assassin once had
classmates at junior high.

35
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:55,123
Whenever l bump into old pals...

36
00:09:55,415 --> 00:09:58,166
...they always ask the
same old questions.

37
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,125
What do you do for a living?

38
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:04,544
Got a card?
We must keep in touch

39
00:10:04,752 --> 00:10:07,587
Let's arrange something.
What d'you think?

40
00:10:07,878 --> 00:10:10,338
As long as there's money
to make...

41
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:15,131
You run your own business?

42
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,049
Are you married?

43
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:20,050
Don't tell me you're still single?

44
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:24,719
Hey A son
He looks exactly like you

45
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:28,429
You're telling me... Your
wife's a nigger, eh?

46
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:31,763
You're very liberal.
Blacks... They're beautiful.

47
00:10:32,013 --> 00:10:36,265
Colour doesn't matter, does it?
You really look like a couple.

48
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,683
Say, are you insured?

49
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:43,310
Think about it. l'm a pro.
insurance is my business.

50
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:46,644
You know, l've been crowned
'King ofthe Brokers...

51
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:48,145
...in Southeast Asia.

52
00:10:48,437 --> 00:10:52,022
TlME are doing an interview
with me in the next few days.

53
00:10:52,313 --> 00:10:54,564
Look, for old time's sake...

54
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:57,607
...l'll work out a decent plan for you.

55
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:00,984
You may not want to hear this...

56
00:11:01,234 --> 00:11:05,194
...but accidents happen, your
family needs protection.

57
00:11:05,402 --> 00:11:07,028
Your job involves travel.

58
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:09,404
You must think ofyour
family unit.

59
00:11:09,654 --> 00:11:11,613
Would an insurance company...

60
00:11:11,863 --> 00:11:13,989
...underwrite a professional
killer, l wonder?

61
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:18,366
l'd love to take up his offer...
but who do l name as beneficiary?

62
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:22,159
Remember the big bosom?
The one we both fancied?

63
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:25,160
We're getting married next week.
Here's an invitation card.

64
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:29,079
Just fill in you name, okay?

65
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:32,664
Please come, and l'll have
the insurance ready for you.

66
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:35,248
Bring your wife along, too.
See you

67
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,750
Ages ago l paid a black woman
$30 to pose with me for a photo.

68
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,251
Whenever people asked
l'd say she's my wife.

69
00:11:43,543 --> 00:11:47,378
And the kid in the picture? l think
l bought him an ice cream.

70
00:11:47,795 --> 00:11:50,754
l always wanted to go
to a wedding reception.

71
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:54,798
But l know it's not my scene.

72
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:48,804
Sifting through a man's rubbish...

73
00:13:49,137 --> 00:13:52,263
...one can easily find clues
as to his background.

74
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:55,890
He visits this bar a lot.

75
00:13:58,975 --> 00:14:00,308
Likes the laid-back atmosphere.

76
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:04,602
l always sit at the same table
he sat at.

77
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:08,187
Makes me feel sort of
closer to him.

78
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:17,274
There are some people you
can never get close to.

79
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:22,776
Get too close,
and you'll find him boring.

80
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,612
l'm someone
who plays by the rules.

81
00:14:27,612 --> 00:14:32,530
l know how to be easygoing.

82
00:18:57,182 --> 00:18:58,808
No, he hasn't come home.

83
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,810
- You're telling the truth?
- Why should l lie?

84
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,728
You live here?

85
00:19:07,478 --> 00:19:08,604
Of course.

86
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,938
- Ever seen this person?
- No.

87
00:19:23,276 --> 00:19:26,611
Keep out of sight.
The cops are still outside.

88
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:41,159
Where is your son?

89
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:44,035
We rub shoulders with people
every day.

90
00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:48,495
Strangers who may even become
friends or confidants.

91
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:53,539
One thing l do know-these cops
will never be my friends.

92
00:19:54,414 --> 00:19:57,999
My name's He Qiwu.
My prison number was 223.

93
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:02,168
l haven't seen him for days.
l'll inform you when he returns.

94
00:20:02,543 --> 00:20:05,044
l saw him come in.
l want the truth

95
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:11,255
That's enough Keep still

96
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:31,930
l'm a very happy man.

97
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:34,473
l was very talkative
when l was small.

98
00:20:34,806 --> 00:20:38,641
But since eating an out of date can
of pineapple when l was five...

99
00:20:39,016 --> 00:20:41,059
...l lost my voice.

100
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:44,644
For this reason.
l have very few friends.

101
00:20:44,935 --> 00:20:47,853
l also found it diffiicult
to find a job.

102
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:51,521
So l finally decided
to be my own boss.

103
00:21:08,362 --> 00:21:11,280
Having no capital,
my only option...

104
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:15,698
...was to enter shops after hours
and run my business that way.

105
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:19,783
l don't mean to take advantage,
but it's practical...

106
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:23,285
to run an all-night business.

107
00:21:23,868 --> 00:21:30,329
Customers do come in at 3 a.m.
to buy meat. Business is business.

108
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:33,039
Always satisfy the needs
ofyour customer.

109
00:21:33,331 --> 00:21:36,832
As the old saying goes:
'The customer is always right'.

110
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,834
And as the boss, l must be
kind, caring and tolerant.

111
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,085
One can't afford to be selfish...

112
00:21:43,126 --> 00:21:46,169
...there's no such thing as a
free lunch in this world.

113
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:49,671
l always work very hard at night
- well, until very late.

114
00:21:50,046 --> 00:21:53,547
l don't make a fortune,
but l'm happy.

115
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,472
Are you crazy? Why are you
making me wash my clothes?

116
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:16,849
l'm a beggar The last thing
l need is a laundry

117
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,558
Leave me alone...

118
00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:23,852
You are crazy
Get your hands off my clothes

119
00:22:24,185 --> 00:22:28,395
Sod off
l'll smash you to pulp

120
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:32,272
Okay, l'll pay you...
if it's money you want

121
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:33,939
Cretin

122
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,066
Leave it
l don't want an aubergine

123
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,776
No, l don't want them
l must act like a lady.

124
00:22:43,026 --> 00:22:46,028
l don't accept freebies from
strangers. People will talk

125
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:48,404
l'll have a melon, okay?

126
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:51,280
Here

127
00:22:57,032 --> 00:23:00,117
What the hell
You crazy or something?

128
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,326
Stop that

129
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:08,495
Listen, l washed
my hair yesterday...

130
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:16,207
Ouch Take it easy...

131
00:23:16,457 --> 00:23:18,708
Don't scratch

132
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:24,419
l just want a late snack.

133
00:23:24,627 --> 00:23:26,461
l don't need a shampoo

134
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:32,964
Okay, you win.
Do what you like

135
00:23:37,924 --> 00:23:38,883
No

136
00:23:39,842 --> 00:23:42,551
l don't want a shave

137
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:50,679
Don't touch me...

138
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:57,891
Listen, l know l'm diffiicult,
but l know some...

139
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:00,058
...who aren't

140
00:24:03,143 --> 00:24:06,561
Please don't shave me...
l don't want a shave...

141
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:09,104
l'll pay you not to, okay?

142
00:24:10,354 --> 00:24:11,563
Thanks.

143
00:24:12,605 --> 00:24:14,731
A double cone, please.

144
00:24:16,732 --> 00:24:18,149
Fuck lt's you

145
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:20,900
l'm sorry... sorry...

146
00:24:29,487 --> 00:24:32,489
Stop pulling my hair, okay?

147
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,990
l'll serve myself.

148
00:24:42,493 --> 00:24:43,743
l'll do it.

149
00:24:50,704 --> 00:24:54,289
Hi, it's me.
What are you doing?

150
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,458
Go to bed, don't wait up.

151
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,501
l'm having some ice-cream.

152
00:25:04,293 --> 00:25:07,587
l hope l can come home soon.

153
00:25:07,795 --> 00:25:11,255
l don't know how much more
l'll have to eat.

154
00:25:11,797 --> 00:25:14,298
Of course l'll have to pay

155
00:25:19,216 --> 00:25:22,343
Look, l've run into this guy, and...

156
00:25:22,843 --> 00:25:25,261
What's to explain?
lt's the truth

157
00:25:27,178 --> 00:25:29,721
Come down and see for yourself.

158
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:31,638
Hey

159
00:25:35,932 --> 00:25:39,600
Oh, no way
l can't eat that

160
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:43,810
lt'll burn my moustache.

161
00:25:45,436 --> 00:25:47,145
This is beyond a joke...

162
00:25:51,438 --> 00:25:54,314
What the hell's going on?

163
00:25:54,606 --> 00:25:58,524
l said come by yourself. l didn't
say bring dad and the kids

164
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,692
Too much ice cream's
bad for dad.

165
00:26:01,984 --> 00:26:04,235
What if something happens?

166
00:26:05,236 --> 00:26:07,903
And the kids have school tomorrow.

167
00:26:08,237 --> 00:26:10,029
What's that...?

168
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:20,325
l don't want to die
from eating too much ice cream.

169
00:26:20,534 --> 00:26:22,701
Look, l'm being serious.

170
00:26:23,993 --> 00:26:26,203
l'll pay you, okay?

171
00:26:26,536 --> 00:26:30,538
Tell me how much, and l'll
buy all the ice cream. Go on.

172
00:26:33,456 --> 00:26:35,832
My ice cream maybe a
bit more expensive...

173
00:26:36,374 --> 00:26:39,333
...but l think this family's
having a great time tonight.

174
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:44,502
l love ice cream.
When l was a kid...

175
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:47,336
...an ice cream van always
stopped outside our place.

176
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,504
Every time l saw it.
l was happy.

177
00:26:50,421 --> 00:26:54,506
l even asked my dad why he
didn't drive an ice cream van.

178
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,133
He didn't answer me.
l later found out...

179
00:26:58,466 --> 00:27:01,467
...that my mum was killed
by an ice cream van.

180
00:27:03,718 --> 00:27:05,427
l was born in Taiwan...

181
00:27:05,511 --> 00:27:08,595
...and came to Hong Kong
with dad when l was five.

182
00:27:08,637 --> 00:27:11,305
He worked as an assistant
in Chungking Mansions.

183
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:15,723
After my mum's death.
he very rarely talked.

184
00:27:15,765 --> 00:27:17,891
And we never ate ice cream.

185
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:22,184
The fact that we're both
quiet and subtle...

186
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:24,685
...probably explains the
close bond between us.

187
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,730
What are you thinking of?

188
00:27:32,313 --> 00:27:34,606
And why the ice cream?

189
00:27:50,196 --> 00:27:53,531
You know l don't like ice cream.
lt's too cold...

190
00:27:53,989 --> 00:27:56,407
...and it gives me the runs.

191
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:10,579
You're crazy

192
00:28:24,794 --> 00:28:28,462
Let me out
What are you playing at?

193
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,173
What are you doing?
l'll kill you

194
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,882
Open this door
You hear?

195
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:53,472
Paging 9090.

196
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:56,390
l'd like to leave a message.

197
00:28:56,682 --> 00:28:59,100
l'll meet his frinds tomorrow.

198
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:02,351
Let me know where and when.

199
00:30:41,017 --> 00:30:44,143
lt's crystal clear...crystal clear...

200
00:30:45,227 --> 00:30:49,271
l just want to check
that l've got the right place.

201
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:52,355
lt's a fast-food store,
not a barber shop.

202
00:30:52,564 --> 00:30:56,190
You may think that we're
making a lot of money.

203
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:59,650
What price a human life?

204
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,317
Depends on your luck.

205
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,110
Business can be slack for ages.

206
00:31:03,276 --> 00:31:05,236
So, to make a living...

207
00:31:05,444 --> 00:31:07,403
...l'll occasionally invest
in other businesses.

208
00:31:07,445 --> 00:31:09,821
Like debt collection.

209
00:31:09,862 --> 00:31:10,905
Thanks.

210
00:31:14,656 --> 00:31:15,782
Hold on. l'll get your money.

211
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:21,951
Here.

212
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,574
But lately. l've suffered
quite a few injuries.

213
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:02,493
l hate digging bullets
out of my own body.

214
00:33:03,451 --> 00:33:05,369
lt's very exhausting.

215
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:09,787
l went to bed early that night.

216
00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:13,831
When l awoke next morning,
l came to a decision.

217
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,963
Lady, we're closed.

218
00:33:30,838 --> 00:33:33,381
Two weeks after l was
injured, l asked her out.

219
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:35,923
l wanted to tell her my decision.

220
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:40,800
But... l didn't show up.

221
00:34:02,643 --> 00:34:07,061
l'm sure she'll come looking
for me in a couple of days.

222
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:11,938
After all, we've been partners
for a long time.

223
00:34:18,691 --> 00:34:22,776
Being partners, you get to
understand each other.

224
00:34:23,443 --> 00:34:24,777
Almost able to read
each other's minds.

225
00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:26,736
l'd often leave her some clues...

226
00:34:28,404 --> 00:34:30,821
...to trace my actions, or
my whereabouts.

227
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:34,323
After all these years.
she's become part of my life.

228
00:34:41,034 --> 00:34:43,035
But nothing can remain
the same forever.

229
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:46,453
l have to tell her
that l desperately want out.

230
00:34:47,078 --> 00:34:50,538
But l don't know how to start.

231
00:34:52,414 --> 00:34:54,831
So, l've devised another method.

232
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:03,126
A woman may come in
asking for me.

233
00:35:03,418 --> 00:35:04,835
Please give her this coin...

234
00:35:05,085 --> 00:35:07,545
...and tell her that 1 81 8
is my lucky number.

235
00:35:19,842 --> 00:35:23,760
1 81 8...it's the code for one of
the songs in this jukebox.

236
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,511
After she's listened to the song.

237
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:28,512
...she'll understand my message.

238
00:36:36,582 --> 00:36:37,499
Okay if l sit here?

239
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:09,012
lt's raining

240
00:37:11,471 --> 00:37:14,973
Let's have some fun
Oh, it feels so great

241
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,932
Come on

242
00:37:35,315 --> 00:37:35,982
Why?

243
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,900
Perhaps l'm tense...

244
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,275
Why?

245
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:42,484
You coming?

246
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:44,569
No?

247
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:47,695
Okay

248
00:37:52,197 --> 00:37:54,156
Sure you don't want to come?

249
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:56,115
Made up your mind?

250
00:37:57,032 --> 00:37:58,074
Forget it

251
00:38:03,743 --> 00:38:06,744
Hey...come and get it

252
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:21,125
lt's not drying.

253
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:25,961
l'll take it to the cleaners
for you tomorrow.

254
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:27,587
Okay?

255
00:38:30,088 --> 00:38:32,338
Did you hear me?

256
00:38:34,131 --> 00:38:35,715
Answer me

257
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:41,259
Open the door

258
00:38:45,636 --> 00:38:50,054
Hmm, nice. Fits you well.

259
00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:52,889
Whose is this?

260
00:38:54,264 --> 00:38:55,598
Why?

261
00:38:56,474 --> 00:38:58,308
Do l know you?

262
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,725
You bastard

263
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:08,270
What are you doing?

264
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,812
Help

265
00:39:14,398 --> 00:39:16,940
What now?

266
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:22,026
What do you want?

267
00:39:39,075 --> 00:39:40,575
What do you want?

268
00:39:41,951 --> 00:39:44,285
l'm overwhelmed

269
00:39:44,702 --> 00:39:45,619
Great

270
00:40:08,795 --> 00:40:10,421
Guess why l became a blonde?

271
00:40:11,505 --> 00:40:12,672
l don't know.

272
00:40:14,631 --> 00:40:16,549
So no one will forget me.

273
00:40:17,341 --> 00:40:18,674
Looks great

274
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,759
You're making fun of me.

275
00:40:21,009 --> 00:40:23,051
No, you're very special.

276
00:40:23,468 --> 00:40:25,469
l've heard it all before.

277
00:40:25,636 --> 00:40:26,886
From whom?

278
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:30,638
You

279
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:33,639
We were together for some time.

280
00:40:33,847 --> 00:40:35,598
l had long hair.

281
00:40:37,432 --> 00:40:40,350
You called me 'Baby'.

282
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:43,310
Really?

283
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:45,978
Yes.

284
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:50,021
Let bygones be bygones.

285
00:40:50,313 --> 00:40:52,980
You like me now, that's fine.

286
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,191
l didn't say that.

287
00:40:59,942 --> 00:41:02,193
l want some female company.

288
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,235
Fine.

289
00:41:05,152 --> 00:41:06,694
Just for the night.

290
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,738
Maybe you'll like me
better in the morning.

291
00:44:33,281 --> 00:44:36,407
Get out On your way

292
00:44:37,115 --> 00:44:41,034

295
00:44:57,874 --> 00:44:59,917
You want to have kids?

296
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,209
What's all this crap?

297
00:45:04,419 --> 00:45:06,795
You want to get marrid? Fine

298
00:45:07,837 --> 00:45:11,255
l'll marry you...but
l'll need some time.

299
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:15,381
There's no need? Why?
What do you mean?

300
00:45:15,673 --> 00:45:18,508
Oh, you dickhead

301
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:23,927

Well, what a perfect couple

306
00:45:41,767 --> 00:45:44,644

00:45:47,937 --> 00:45:51,813
Chinese style? Me, as a pageboy?

And now you're marrying him

He doesn't love you

He's using you to bear him

The night's full ofweirdos.

next time l see you.

l wish l could tell her...

339
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:06,244
...you can't solve
problems over the phone.

340
00:48:06,536 --> 00:48:08,662
You have to talk, face to face.

341
00:48:08,704 --> 00:48:10,871
lt that fails, you can
punch him on the nose.

342
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:13,622
l keep my thoughts to myself.

343
00:48:13,956 --> 00:48:17,249
But somehow, she appears
to be able to read my mind.

344
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:23,251
l think you're right. Let's go.

345
00:48:42,259 --> 00:48:46,636
Blondie, l know you're there
Come out ifyou've got the guts

346
00:48:46,845 --> 00:48:49,387
We're gonna torch the place

347
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:51,555
One, two, three

348
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:53,847
Wrong floor

349
00:48:55,765 --> 00:48:58,474
Blondie Come on out

350
00:48:58,474 --> 00:49:03,060
3 seconds and you burn
One, two, three

00:49:04,935 --> 00:49:06,394
Let's try the next floor.

352
00:49:08,729 --> 00:49:09,729
ls that a wig?

353
00:49:09,979 --> 00:49:12,397
No way, it comes with age

354
00:49:12,605 --> 00:49:15,356
Looks blond, not grey.
You related to Blondie?

355
00:49:16,107 --> 00:49:17,607
l don't know any Blondie.

356
00:49:17,899 --> 00:49:19,275
Her nickname's 'Stowaway'
Well?

357
00:49:19,567 --> 00:49:22,276
- Funny name
- ls she your chick?

358
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:24,944
Leave me alone, you loonies

359
00:49:25,569 --> 00:49:28,320
Pervert Follow her...

360
00:49:29,487 --> 00:49:31,363
- ls Blondie your daughter?
- No.

361
00:49:31,655 --> 00:49:34,489
l can see a resemblance.
You've forgotten her?

362
00:49:34,781 --> 00:49:36,532
- Think hard
- Leave it

363
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,574
We searched high and low
all night.

364
00:49:38,825 --> 00:49:41,534
l don't think she knows
where this blondie lives.

365
00:49:42,076 --> 00:49:43,368
l give up.

366
00:49:43,952 --> 00:49:48,078
Everyone protects her, hides
her away. Where the hell is she?

367
00:49:48,412 --> 00:49:50,163
Why won't anyone help me?

368
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:51,997
The slut

369
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:54,873
lt's not fair
What kind of game is this?

370
00:49:55,123 --> 00:49:56,665
l'm not playing anymore

371
00:49:56,874 --> 00:49:59,542
You must have slept with her.

372
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:03,668
l bet you have, but you won't
admit it. Right?

373
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,711
You on vacation?

374
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,045
Think the whole world's
on your side, bitch?

375
00:50:19,675 --> 00:50:21,259
Blondie

376
00:50:21,968 --> 00:50:25,636
You slut You dare show
your face? You're finished

377
00:50:26,469 --> 00:50:30,346
You bitch Slut Tramp

378
00:50:30,638 --> 00:50:33,556
Fuck you You bitch

379
00:50:38,474 --> 00:50:41,476
Where does all this energy
come from?

380
00:50:45,644 --> 00:50:48,062
Stop eating - watch the door.

381
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:50,479
Blondie could show up
any minute now.

382
00:50:50,813 --> 00:50:52,772
She comes here with her dad.

383
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:59,233
How do you spell 'Blondie'?

384
00:51:03,443 --> 00:51:06,778
Oh, what the hell...

385
00:51:09,154 --> 00:51:10,404
Listen to this.

386
00:51:10,613 --> 00:51:14,740
l, Blondie, a.k.a. Stowaway,
behaved in an ugly & shameless way.

387
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,949
l'm returning Johnny Kwong to his
rightful girlfriend Charlie Young.

388
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,659
l hereby terminate all
relations with him.

389
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:24,785
Our signatures binding until
death. Great. You think so?

390
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:28,620
l'll make Blondie sign this.

391
00:51:28,912 --> 00:51:31,371
Must get her fingerprints
and l.D. number on it.

392
00:51:31,663 --> 00:51:34,331
Get her dad as a witness.
photograph them together.

393
00:51:34,623 --> 00:51:35,957
Blondie?

394
00:51:36,915 --> 00:51:38,124
You're Blondie?

395
00:51:43,126 --> 00:51:44,419
You're Blondie?

396
00:51:44,752 --> 00:51:45,794
Yeah, so what?

397
00:51:49,004 --> 00:51:50,713
Hey, you Blondie?

398
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,882
l'll fucking chop you
into little pieces

399
00:52:38,608 --> 00:52:40,692
They say women are
made ofwater.

400
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:42,276
So are some men.

401
00:52:43,485 --> 00:52:45,902
Most folk experience first love
in their teens.

402
00:52:46,569 --> 00:52:48,237
l was a bit older.

403
00:52:48,862 --> 00:52:50,529
Maybe l'm too choosy.

404
00:52:51,363 --> 00:52:54,156
On May 30th, 1 995...

405
00:52:54,364 --> 00:52:56,323
...l fell in love for the first time.

406
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,866
lt was raining that night.

407
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,534
l looked at her...

408
00:53:01,784 --> 00:53:04,577
...and had this feeling
like l was a store.

409
00:53:05,077 --> 00:53:06,995
...and that she was me.

410
00:53:07,078 --> 00:53:10,454
Without any warning, she
suddenly enters the store.

411
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,998
l don't know how long she'll stay
The longer the better, of course.

412
00:55:01,251 --> 00:55:04,544
When did you last wash?
You need a bath.

413
00:55:04,835 --> 00:55:07,461
Huh? You stink all over

414
00:55:08,962 --> 00:55:11,963
When did you dye your hair?

415
00:55:16,257 --> 00:55:18,466
They say love can change a man.

416
00:55:18,716 --> 00:55:22,259
l find myself looking handsome
and becoming more charming.

417
00:55:22,509 --> 00:55:25,386
Suddenly, l discover
my hair's turning blond.

418
00:55:25,761 --> 00:55:27,970
Perhaps it's because
my mum was Russian.

419
00:55:28,845 --> 00:55:31,388
Dad speaks in a Taiwanese
dialect...

420
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,389
...which no on can understand...

421
00:55:34,681 --> 00:55:36,182
...because of his strong
Russian accent.

422
00:55:36,432 --> 00:55:38,683
Hello? Chungking Mansions.

423
00:55:39,016 --> 00:55:41,559
Who's speaking? Blondie?

424
00:55:57,941 --> 00:56:00,233
On June 22nd, 1 995...

425
00:56:00,525 --> 00:56:03,943
...the ltalian team Sampdoria
came to play in Hong Kong.

426
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:06,111
l took Charlie to the match.

427
00:56:06,444 --> 00:56:08,237
She's a fan of Ruud Gullit.

428
00:56:09,529 --> 00:56:11,947
She was ecstatic that night.

429
00:56:12,905 --> 00:56:15,615
She insisted in staying on
after the game.

430
00:56:15,948 --> 00:56:20,158
lt's not right
What was the point of playing?

431
00:56:21,034 --> 00:56:25,452
They had the better team.
Our boys were outclassed

432
00:56:26,286 --> 00:56:30,413
There's no miracles in this
world. Fat chance

433
00:56:33,831 --> 00:56:35,832
Do you know why l came?

434
00:56:37,582 --> 00:56:41,042
l was actually hoping
for a miracle.

435
00:56:41,626 --> 00:56:44,794
Johnny's a great fan of Gullit.

436
00:56:45,085 --> 00:56:46,669
l thought he would come.

437
00:56:47,211 --> 00:56:50,463
He wouldn't have had time.
He's getting married tomorrow.

438
00:56:52,213 --> 00:56:54,423
Guess why l was
yelling and waving...

439
00:56:54,756 --> 00:56:58,508
...and acting crazy earlier?
l hoped he'd see me on TV.

440
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:09,471
He promised me he'd come
So why didn't he?

441
00:57:11,888 --> 00:57:16,390
l realise that she still misses
Johnny, but it hurts me.

442
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,600
But l'm an optimistic person.
lt's said...

443
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:22,143
...nothing remains the same forever.

444
00:57:22,476 --> 00:57:24,894
But will it apply
to Johnny and Charlie?

445
00:57:25,769 --> 00:57:27,728
Time will tell. l suppose.

446
00:57:42,568 --> 00:57:44,527
Perhaps l'm being
a bit too optimistic.

447
00:57:45,611 --> 00:57:48,904
A few days later, l invited
her to another match.

448
00:57:49,779 --> 00:57:51,196
She didn't turn up.

449
00:57:52,822 --> 00:57:55,573
l really thought she'd soon
get over Johnny.

450
00:57:56,699 --> 00:58:00,659
How wrong could l have been?
lt was me she got over.

451
00:58:04,202 --> 00:58:06,578
l stayed on after the match.

452
00:58:07,078 --> 00:58:10,788
As the stadium lights dimmed.
l redlised she wouldn't show.

453
00:58:10,955 --> 00:58:13,622
l'm heartbroken.
Not a hope

454
00:58:21,542 --> 00:58:23,877
They say 'love hurts'...

455
00:58:24,252 --> 00:58:26,419
...but it's different with me.

456
00:58:33,589 --> 00:58:34,631
Something strange happens.
My hair changes colour.

457
00:58:34,965 --> 00:58:35,715
Just like with my first love.

458
00:58:35,965 --> 00:58:38,800
l also realised how irresponsible
l had been in the past.

459
00:58:40,384 --> 00:58:43,843
l shouldn't have taken over
other people's shops...

460
00:58:44,052 --> 00:58:45,761
...the way l did.

461
00:58:46,011 --> 00:58:48,220
Every shop
must have its own feeling.

462
00:58:49,512 --> 00:58:51,722
This realisation cheered me up
and prompted me...

463
00:58:52,722 --> 00:58:54,431
...to change my life.

464
00:59:08,395 --> 00:59:09,604
Welcome.

465
00:59:11,271 --> 00:59:12,564
Just for one.

466
00:59:13,606 --> 00:59:17,232
We'll have a new menu
next time you come.

467
00:59:17,774 --> 00:59:18,900
Am l keeping you?

468
00:59:21,692 --> 00:59:24,027
Get a glass. Be my guest.

469
00:59:34,073 --> 00:59:35,073
How's business?

470
00:59:48,203 --> 00:59:50,746
What's it cost to set up
a place like this?

471
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:11,046
Hi, there.
You interested in a business?

472
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,965
Just wondered how much
a place like this cost.

473
01:00:16,298 --> 01:00:17,924
At least a million.

474
01:00:18,299 --> 01:00:21,509
When you live out of a suitcase...

475
01:00:21,717 --> 01:00:24,427
...you don't need a place
ofyour own.

476
01:00:25,427 --> 01:00:27,095
Things have changed, though.

477
01:00:27,386 --> 01:00:29,721
Got to start planning ahead.

478
01:00:30,638 --> 01:00:32,930
l had a good chat that evening.

479
01:00:33,389 --> 01:00:35,181
He even offered to help me...

480
01:00:35,973 --> 01:00:40,267
...if l started up my own place.

481
01:00:41,142 --> 01:00:42,726
- Another beer?
- Why not?

482
01:01:00,942 --> 01:01:02,943
What are you really worth?

483
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:19,617
l'd stayed away from the bar
for some time.

484
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,493
l couldn't bear hearing
that song.

485
01:01:24,744 --> 01:01:27,245
But some things you can't
escape from.

486
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:31,205
So, after that evening,
l never went back.

487
01:01:32,372 --> 01:01:35,582
Happy birthday to you

488
01:02:04,927 --> 01:02:08,429
Happy birthday to you

489
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:12,680
Happy birthday to you

490
01:02:13,139 --> 01:02:17,015
Happy birthday, happy birthday

491
01:02:17,307 --> 01:02:23,018
Happy birthday to you

492
01:02:25,186 --> 01:02:26,770
- Okay?
- Good.

493
01:03:00,117 --> 01:03:01,659
How are you?

494
01:03:04,035 --> 01:03:06,995
Dad's fine. No need to worry.

495
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:12,747
l know it's your birthday soon.

496
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:15,540
Sorry l can't be with you.

497
01:03:16,832 --> 01:03:19,833
ls mum feeling better now?

498
01:03:21,209 --> 01:03:25,752
ls your sister okay?
Doing well at school?

499
01:03:29,879 --> 01:03:31,588
How was that?

500
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:34,339
Sato-san loves his family
very much.

501
01:03:34,881 --> 01:03:39,592
Before his present job he
used to be a film director.

502
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,843
So whenever he has family
business to talk about...

503
01:03:43,176 --> 01:03:45,469
...he just makes a video recording.

504
01:03:46,678 --> 01:03:50,846
l'm sure his son gets great
pleasure in receiving the tapes.

505
01:03:51,513 --> 01:03:54,223
l'd like to do the same...

506
01:03:54,431 --> 01:03:56,640
...but who would l send
the tapes to?

507
01:03:57,432 --> 01:04:00,183
l can't really send them
to myself.

508
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,004
Maybe l could be like
Sato-san's son...

509
01:05:09,671 --> 01:05:12,005
...and imagine the happiness
he gets from the tapes.

510
01:05:13,672 --> 01:05:15,423
How much for a double room?

511
01:05:15,673 --> 01:05:17,174
With twin beds?

512
01:05:17,382 --> 01:05:18,091
Yes...

513
01:05:18,299 --> 01:05:20,425
Twin room - four fifty.

514
01:05:20,675 --> 01:05:22,176
Too damned expensive.

515
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:24,635
You've got to be kidding.

516
01:05:29,846 --> 01:05:31,638
Forget it

517
01:05:31,888 --> 01:05:33,431
Calm down...

518
01:06:26,036 --> 01:06:28,120
Stop filming
Go to bed

519
01:06:35,665 --> 01:06:39,833
That's enough
Go on, get out of here

520
01:07:40,067 --> 01:07:42,234
Later that night...

521
01:07:42,484 --> 01:07:45,236
...l caught dad having a
sneak look at the tape.

522
01:07:45,652 --> 01:07:47,320
He really enjoyed it.

523
01:07:48,278 --> 01:07:50,488
My memory's not that good.
but...

524
01:07:51,155 --> 01:07:55,281
...l did remember that it was
his 60th birthday.

525
01:07:56,490 --> 01:08:00,492
God knows why. But he gets
great amusement watching it.

526
01:08:00,867 --> 01:08:02,951
And l do know that he's happy.

527
01:08:04,994 --> 01:08:06,745
Silly devil...

528
01:08:29,462 --> 01:08:31,838
Working with someone
for a long time...

529
01:08:32,088 --> 01:08:34,673
...you're bound to be influenced
in some way.

530
01:08:34,923 --> 01:08:36,799
l know that fragrance...

531
01:08:38,383 --> 01:08:41,384
...but l'm not used to smelling
it on other women.

532
01:08:48,387 --> 01:08:50,763
This suits me just fine.

533
01:08:51,346 --> 01:08:53,973
lt's shrunk a bit, though.

534
01:08:58,683 --> 01:09:01,809
l always thought the perfume
was a bit overpowering.

535
01:09:02,976 --> 01:09:06,394
l smelt it on this other woman
this afternoon.

536
01:09:07,353 --> 01:09:09,396
She wants to see you.

537
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:11,605
l fixed up a meeting.

538
01:09:13,272 --> 01:09:14,273
Will you go?

539
01:09:19,233 --> 01:09:22,609
l think you should go and
get things sorted out.

540
01:09:25,986 --> 01:09:28,112
Perhaps it's not such a good idea.

541
01:09:34,489 --> 01:09:36,532
Anyway, l thought you'd go.

542
01:09:38,116 --> 01:09:39,241
This is for you.

543
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:32,430
l'd like...

544
01:10:33,514 --> 01:10:35,015
...a packet of crisps.

545
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:38,058
Not the red pack, the yellow

546
01:11:13,948 --> 01:11:16,324
They sit there together
for ages.

547
01:11:16,865 --> 01:11:18,741
l wonder what they're talking about?

548
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:22,409
Meanwhile the rain keeps
bucketing down.

549
01:11:22,701 --> 01:11:26,411
lt's raining so heavily, how will
l get home by myself?

550
01:11:42,043 --> 01:11:44,585
And just when l need
a raincoat...

551
01:11:45,419 --> 01:11:47,420
...he appears at my side.

552
01:11:50,421 --> 01:11:52,130
l hope the rain...

553
01:11:53,547 --> 01:11:54,756
...will never stop.

554
01:11:59,425 --> 01:12:01,426
l'm not coming in.

555
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:07,261
Then why walk me home?

556
01:12:09,179 --> 01:12:11,805
You could've let me walk

557
01:12:12,097 --> 01:12:14,056
l was going to do that anyway.

558
01:12:14,389 --> 01:12:17,015
You trying to be funny?

559
01:12:17,974 --> 01:12:21,309
Oh, what the hell
Just fuck off, will you?

560
01:12:25,186 --> 01:12:26,644
We came to an agreement.

561
01:12:26,936 --> 01:12:28,687
l never agreed anything

562
01:12:29,271 --> 01:12:32,689
You insisted on seeing her, not me
What d'you want from me now?

563
01:12:34,481 --> 01:12:38,108
You think l'm stupid?
Oh, get lost

564
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:43,693
You're a cheat and a liar

565
01:12:48,529 --> 01:12:50,613
Give me your hand...

566
01:12:56,490 --> 01:12:59,825
Why?

567
01:13:00,117 --> 01:13:02,243
l've left my mark, okay?

568
01:13:02,785 --> 01:13:06,328
You may forget my face, but
you won't forget my bite

569
01:13:09,454 --> 01:13:11,997
l'm easily recognised, though...

570
01:13:12,205 --> 01:13:15,790
...by the mole on my face.

571
01:13:16,082 --> 01:13:19,583
lf a woman with a mole on her
face ever comes up to you...

572
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,502
...it could be me.

573
01:13:26,878 --> 01:13:29,171
Will you remember that?

574
01:13:32,755 --> 01:13:34,423
l'll remember.

575
01:14:00,183 --> 01:14:02,184
Will l remember her?

576
01:14:03,977 --> 01:14:05,978
Actually, it's not important.

577
01:14:06,228 --> 01:14:10,980
For her l was an oasis in
her journey through life.

578
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:13,356
l hope she soon reaches
her destination...

579
01:14:13,564 --> 01:14:16,190
...and finds her soulmate
for life.

580
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:18,274
We all need a partner.

581
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:22,109
When will l find mine?

582
01:14:30,029 --> 01:14:31,697
Are we still partners?

583
01:14:53,163 --> 01:14:55,639
l don't know how to answer
her question.

584
01:14:56,148 --> 01:14:58,897
l've come to look at partners
from a new angle.

585
01:15:00,276 --> 01:15:02,201
As a business partner,
she's perfect...

586
01:15:03,684 --> 01:15:06,044
...but not one you could
spend your life with.

587
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:10,880
l'm terminating
our business relationship.

588
01:15:23,301 --> 01:15:25,969
Do me one last favour, will you?

589
01:15:33,347 --> 01:15:35,056
l don't know why l agreed.

590
01:15:35,723 --> 01:15:37,807
Probably because it's a last favour.

591
01:16:03,068 --> 01:16:04,819
l want to place an advert
for my friend.

592
01:16:09,321 --> 01:16:11,030
l want the front page.

593
01:19:29,779 --> 01:19:34,823
The best thing about my job -
l don't have to make decisions.

594
01:19:35,615 --> 01:19:41,075
Who's to die, when and where,
it's all been planned by others.

595
01:19:44,118 --> 01:19:45,619
l'm a lazy person.

596
01:19:46,703 --> 01:19:49,079
l like others to arrange things for me.

597
01:19:50,621 --> 01:19:52,997
But l've been doing some
thinking lately.

598
01:19:53,414 --> 01:19:55,748
l feel the need for change.

599
01:19:56,874 --> 01:19:58,791
Whether it's right or wrong...

600
01:19:59,667 --> 01:20:02,960
...l must make a decision
for myself.

601
01:20:44,435 --> 01:20:46,228
'Being photographed will
shorten your life'.

602
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:49,229
Seems there's some truth in it.

603
01:20:50,313 --> 01:20:52,272
One evening,
dad was taken ill.

604
01:20:53,106 --> 01:20:54,648
l took him to hospital.

605
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:59,025
A little later, he passed away.

606
01:21:01,526 --> 01:21:03,068
Thanks to him, all my life...

607
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:05,861
...l've always felt like
a little boy.

608
01:21:07,278 --> 01:21:10,279
He was always there to
sort out my problems.

609
01:21:11,822 --> 01:21:14,656
Packing his things away
that evening...

610
01:21:14,656 --> 01:21:21,284
He was always there to
sort out my problems.

611
01:21:21,326 --> 01:21:41,584
Packing his things away
that evening...

612
01:21:42,501 --> 01:21:43,085
...l felt grown-up for the first time.

613
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,627
l didn't want to be grown-up...
...l just wanted dad with me.

614
01:21:44,627 --> 01:21:47,086
When l left the hotel...

615
01:21:47,503 --> 01:21:48,337
...l took the videotapes with me.

616
01:21:48,587 --> 01:21:49,879
l watched them
over and over again.

617
01:23:30,838 --> 01:23:33,714
Watching dad cooking
made me very happy.

618
01:23:35,173 --> 01:23:38,966
l know l'll never taste
his steaks again...

619
01:23:39,508 --> 01:23:42,718
...but l'll never forget
just how they tasted.

620
01:23:48,762 --> 01:23:51,430
Oh, hell, it's you again

621
01:23:51,722 --> 01:23:53,264
Not the hair Leave it...

622
01:23:54,556 --> 01:23:57,766
l'm happy to be your client.

623
01:23:58,183 --> 01:23:59,975
Did l ever refuse?

624
01:24:00,475 --> 01:24:02,393
l didn't, did l?

625
01:24:02,684 --> 01:24:05,311
Just look at me
Let go of me...

626
01:24:05,561 --> 01:24:07,478
My wife's visiting China...

627
01:24:07,687 --> 01:24:10,604
...and l've some business
to attend to.

628
01:24:10,855 --> 01:24:13,439
Give me three hours and
l'll be back.

629
01:24:13,647 --> 01:24:16,315
Three hours, okay?
Three hours...

630
01:24:17,607 --> 01:24:19,233
Two hours?

631
01:24:19,483 --> 01:24:21,692
Two hours and l'll be back. Deal?

632
01:24:22,818 --> 01:24:27,111
Trust me. We're old friends,
aren't we?

633
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:30,529
People cross all the time.
Two hours...

634
01:24:30,863 --> 01:24:34,781
Trust me, you have my word
We're like brothers, right?

635
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:39,033
You want it written in blood?

636
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:41,451
You're kidding, right?

637
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:44,035
Leave it out...

638
01:24:44,285 --> 01:24:47,286
Just one hour, okay?

639
01:24:47,537 --> 01:24:50,996
Don't do this...
have mercy... Wait...

640
01:24:53,831 --> 01:24:56,415
Can l have some
small change, please?

641
01:25:03,085 --> 01:25:04,002
Thanks.

642
01:25:08,295 --> 01:25:10,880
l'm downstairs already.

643
01:25:11,088 --> 01:25:13,756
l'm waiting for you. 'Bye.

644
01:25:22,343 --> 01:25:24,885
Talk about bad timing...

645
01:25:25,261 --> 01:25:29,262
Shortly after dad died,
Sato-san returned to Japan.

646
01:25:30,304 --> 01:25:32,680
l haven't got much money saved...

647
01:25:32,722 --> 01:25:35,932
...so l can only do what l'm
best at - being my own boss.

648
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,100
l'm being very cautious this time.

649
01:25:39,225 --> 01:25:41,684
l pick only the stronger ones.

650
01:25:41,726 --> 01:25:44,268
Ones that won't get hurt easily.

651
01:25:44,519 --> 01:25:47,478
Take this one for example.
guts of steel.

652
01:25:47,687 --> 01:25:49,646
Saves a lot of hassle.

653
01:25:50,188 --> 01:25:53,147
Sometimes l run into
old acquaintances.

654
01:25:53,147 --> 01:25:55,648
Some haven't changed at all.

655
01:25:56,065 --> 01:25:58,441
Others l hardly recognise.

656
01:25:58,941 --> 01:26:01,276
l'm always glad to see them...

657
01:26:01,526 --> 01:26:04,610
...even though they may not
remember me.

658
01:26:05,944 --> 01:26:09,737
Of course, there are some
exceptions to the rule.

659
01:26:10,029 --> 01:26:12,572
On August 29th, 1 995...

660
01:26:12,864 --> 01:26:15,615
...l ran into my first love again.

661
01:26:15,657 --> 01:26:17,824
l don't think she recognised me.

662
01:26:19,825 --> 01:26:22,201
l guess l'm more handsome now.

663
01:26:30,246 --> 01:26:32,539
- You're late.
- Sorry.

664
01:26:32,789 --> 01:26:36,207
- What's up with him?
- l've no idea.

665
01:26:52,047 --> 01:26:54,965
lt turned quite cold that evening.

666
01:26:55,923 --> 01:26:59,216
l hadn't expected winter
to come so soon.

667
01:27:05,302 --> 01:27:07,678
l'm not used to this
kind ofweather.

668
01:27:09,012 --> 01:27:12,430
lt seems to have been
a long winter.

669
01:27:13,222 --> 01:27:16,307
Although l eat well every day...

670
01:27:17,099 --> 01:27:19,225
...l still feel cold.

671
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:23,351
l've got used to working alone.

672
01:27:24,894 --> 01:27:29,354
Occasionally l do work
with others...

673
01:27:29,396 --> 01:27:32,647
...but not on a regular basis.

674
01:27:33,689 --> 01:27:36,399
l've learnt to be more careful.

675
01:27:37,482 --> 01:27:41,609
For instance, l won't work
in hotels any more.

676
01:27:42,234 --> 01:27:45,152
And no more checking out
rubbish bins.

677
01:27:45,944 --> 01:27:48,362
l firmly believe...

678
01:27:48,612 --> 01:27:52,364
...one mustn't get emotionally
involved with one's partner.

679
01:28:47,803 --> 01:28:50,263
We rub shoulders with many
people every day.

680
01:28:51,138 --> 01:28:54,723
Some may become close friends,
or confidants.

681
01:28:55,098 --> 01:28:58,058
That's why l'm always optimistic.

682
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:01,351
Sometimes it hurts.

683
01:29:01,767 --> 01:29:04,435
Not to worry -
l try to stay happy.

684
01:29:09,354 --> 01:29:12,814
That night,
l saw that woman again.

685
01:29:13,064 --> 01:29:15,898
l knew we'd never be friends
or confidants...

686
01:29:16,190 --> 01:29:19,441
...we'd let too many chances
pass us by.

687
01:29:19,692 --> 01:29:23,443
Nothing happened,
there was no chemistry.

688
01:29:23,777 --> 01:29:26,111
Maybe it was the weather...

689
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:29,862
...but that night
l found her very alluring.

690
01:30:04,752 --> 01:30:09,254
l'm about to leave,
l ask him to take me home.

691
01:30:09,837 --> 01:30:13,047
l haven't ridden pillion
for a long time...

692
01:30:13,381 --> 01:30:16,882
...nor have l been this close
to a man in ages.

693
01:30:17,883 --> 01:30:21,134
The road home isn't very long...

694
01:30:22,009 --> 01:30:25,719
...and l know l'll be
getting off soon.

695
01:30:25,761 --> 01:30:28,178
But at this moment, l'm feeling
such lovely warmth.
