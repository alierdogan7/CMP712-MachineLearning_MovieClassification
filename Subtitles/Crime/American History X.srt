1
00:03:59,963 --> 00:04:02,090
Derek.

2
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,661
What the fuck are you thinking?

3
00:04:09,706 --> 00:04:12,641
There's a black guy outside
breaking into your car.

4
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:15,007
How long's he been there?

5
00:04:15,044 --> 00:04:16,443
l don't know.

6
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,776
What's going on?

7
00:04:17,814 --> 00:04:20,214
Not right now, honey. How many?

8
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,547
Danny, how many?

9
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:22,812
One, l think.

10
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:24,877
ls he strapped?

11
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:26,286
Does he have a gun?

12
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:28,017
l don't fucking know.

13
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,159
Wait a second.
What the fuck is going on?

14
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:34,561
Stay right here and be quiet.

15
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:37,088
Wait a second, Derek. Wait.

16
00:04:42,305 --> 00:04:43,602
Stay right here.

17
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:27,276
l don't have a personal problem
with him.

18
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,437
Don't insult
my intelligence, Murray.

19
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:32,539
You hate this child,
and l think l know why.

20
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:40,480
Dr. Sweeney's office.

21
00:06:40,523 --> 00:06:42,753
l went out with his mother
a few times.

22
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:44,987
That was three years ago.
lt was nothing.

23
00:06:45,028 --> 00:06:46,518
Nothing. Really?

24
00:06:46,563 --> 00:06:49,760
That paper--
Bob, it's a travesty.

25
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:52,893
Arguing for Hitler
as a civil rights hero.

26
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:54,369
You've got to draw the line.

27
00:06:58,274 --> 00:07:01,175
on any book that related to
the struggle for civil rights...

28
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,677
in plain English.

29
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:06,512
l am not disputing the fact
that the child is confused...

30
00:07:06,549 --> 00:07:08,517
and harbors some sick ideas...

31
00:07:08,551 --> 00:07:11,281
but l am not ready
to give up on him yet.

32
00:07:11,321 --> 00:07:14,051
His brother probably
put him up to it.

33
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,422
l guarantee you 100%%...

34
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:18,620
his brother did not
put him up to this.

35
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:20,720
l find that hard to believe.

36
00:07:20,763 --> 00:07:22,458
l know he was a good kid...

37
00:07:22,498 --> 00:07:25,228
and it's a shame what he's been
through, but that's dangerous.

38
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:27,065
Dangerous in what way?

39
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:28,900
That goes too far.

40
00:07:28,938 --> 00:07:32,772
This racist propaganda,
"Mein Kampf" psychobabble...

41
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:36,108
he learned this nonsense,
and he can unlearn it, too.

42
00:07:36,145 --> 00:07:38,943
l will not give up
on this child yet.

43
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:57,830
l knew it was you.

44
00:07:57,867 --> 00:07:59,926
Danny, get in here.

45
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:02,199
l said get in here!

46
00:08:02,238 --> 00:08:03,569
Get in here!

47
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:06,541
Five, four, three, two...

48
00:08:06,576 --> 00:08:08,476
Shut the door!

49
00:08:11,381 --> 00:08:12,905
What's it gonna be, Danny?

50
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:15,575
What's what gonna be?

51
00:08:15,618 --> 00:08:17,779
This petty crap you're pulling.

52
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:21,418
l don't know.

53
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:22,947
Have a seat.

54
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:30,298
How are you doing?

55
00:08:32,702 --> 00:08:34,192
Fine.

56
00:08:35,438 --> 00:08:37,201
Things at home OK?

57
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:44,939
Derek got out this morning,
did he not?

58
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,948
Yeah, he did.

59
00:08:48,985 --> 00:08:51,954
He was one of my students.
You knew that, right?

60
00:08:51,988 --> 00:08:53,819
Honors English.

61
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:57,622
He was a brilliant student
like you...

62
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:03,223
but he hung out with fools,
also like you.

63
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:05,393
Did you bring me in here
to talk about Derek?

64
00:09:05,435 --> 00:09:07,960
What happened to him
has nothing to do with me.

65
00:09:08,004 --> 00:09:12,065
Everything you do right now
has something to do with Derek.

66
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:14,338
l followed directions.
l wrote an "A" Paper.

67
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:16,902
"Mein Kampf"?

68
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:19,908
l should expel you.

69
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:22,645
Go ahead. You don't
think l could handle it?

70
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:24,880
No. l think the street
would kill you.

71
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:26,980
Your rhetoric
and your propaganda...

72
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:29,116
aren't going to save you
out there.

73
00:09:30,493 --> 00:09:31,824
So here's the drill.

74
00:09:32,995 --> 00:09:35,225
l'm your history teacher
from now on.

75
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:38,961
We will discuss current events.

76
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:42,300
We will call this class...

77
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:45,501
American History X.

78
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,476
We meet once a day.

79
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:50,843
All right.
Your first assignment...

80
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,348
is to prepare for me
a new paper due tomorrow.

81
00:09:53,382 --> 00:09:57,079
Come on, Sweeney. lt took me
a week to read "Mein Kampf."

82
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,961
What do you want me to do it on?

83
00:10:08,998 --> 00:10:11,364
Your brother.

84
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,527
Oh, God, man.
Please tell me you're joking.

85
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:15,935
No. l'm not kidding.

86
00:10:15,972 --> 00:10:19,533
l want you to analyze
and interpret all the events...

87
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:21,338
surrounding
Derek's incarceration.

88
00:10:21,377 --> 00:10:25,143
How these events helped shape
your present perspective...

89
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:28,412
concerning life
in contemporary America.

90
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:32,285
The impact on your life,
your family's.

91
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:37,415
Whatever you want to say, Danny.

92
00:10:39,996 --> 00:10:42,988
l'll be the only one reading it.

93
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:49,298
But if it's not on my desk
tomorrow morning...

94
00:10:49,338 --> 00:10:52,705
you are a ghost
at Venice Beach High.

95
00:10:54,076 --> 00:10:55,373
You clear?

96
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:58,438
Yeah, l'm clear.

97
00:11:03,886 --> 00:11:05,376
Telling teacher
l'm fuckin' cheatin'!

98
00:11:05,421 --> 00:11:07,082
ls that what's happening?

99
00:11:08,224 --> 00:11:09,885
l never cheated in my life.

100
00:11:09,926 --> 00:11:11,450
Beat his mo'fuckin' ass.

101
00:11:11,494 --> 00:11:12,722
l didn't say anything!

102
00:11:12,762 --> 00:11:14,059
Why you trippin' on me?

103
00:11:16,499 --> 00:11:19,696
Now why you all kicking it
like that?

104
00:11:19,735 --> 00:11:21,600
What's up, man?

105
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:24,572
What you scared for?
l ain't gonna do nothing.

106
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:33,681
What's up?

107
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:37,379
Want some, too, bitch?
Punk, what's wrong with you?

108
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,853
You want to die?

109
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,214
Punk-ass white boy.

110
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:52,924
You lucky l gotta go to class.
He ain't gonna do nothing.

111
00:11:52,969 --> 00:11:55,870
He don't wanna see me
and the heater.

112
00:11:57,607 --> 00:11:58,869
Lucky the bell rung.

113
00:11:58,908 --> 00:12:00,773
l would have clocked
that white boy.

114
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,608
Punk-ass motherfucker.
Should smoke that fool.

115
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,114
You gotta fucking stand up
for yourself.

116
00:12:22,798 --> 00:12:24,891
We got a whole file
on skinheads here.

117
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:26,401
Part of the same gang?

118
00:12:26,435 --> 00:12:27,595
Venice Beach gang.

119
00:12:27,637 --> 00:12:31,095
Actually,
he's done a stretch at Y.A.

120
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,041
This guy C.C., is that him?

121
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:36,101
Yeah, that's him right there.

122
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,205
This morning we have a guest,
and there he is.

123
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:41,409
Good morning.

124
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,610
Morning, sir.

125
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:43,983
Good to see you.

126
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,214
Good morning.

127
00:12:45,254 --> 00:12:47,279
This here is Dr. Bob Sweeney.

128
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:49,791
He's principal
over at Venice Beach High.

129
00:12:49,825 --> 00:12:52,259
For some time now,
he's been doing outreach work...

130
00:12:52,295 --> 00:12:54,729
with gangs
both in and out of the can.

131
00:12:54,764 --> 00:12:57,665
Three years ago, a local kid
named Derek Vinyard...

132
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,793
was sent up for murdering
a couple of Crips...

133
00:12:59,835 --> 00:13:02,030
who were trying to jack his car.

134
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:05,700
Bob taught Vinyard, and
he's followed this case closely.

135
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:08,039
He was a skinhead, right?

136
00:13:08,077 --> 00:13:10,602
He was more
like "the" skinhead...

137
00:13:10,646 --> 00:13:12,807
the protégé
of Cameron Alexander.

138
00:13:12,848 --> 00:13:15,442
-Who?
-Cameron Alexander.

139
00:13:15,484 --> 00:13:18,476
Here you go. Have a look-see.

140
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:22,287
Cameron Alexander, well,
he's a Venice Beach landmark.

141
00:13:22,325 --> 00:13:24,122
He's the biggest distributor
and writer...

142
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,628
of White Power literature
and videos in L.A. County.

143
00:13:26,662 --> 00:13:29,756
He promotes White Power bands,
he writes reviews...

144
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:32,859
and in his spare time, this guy
even writes hate columns.

145
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:35,700
-Does he have a record?
-He's pretty clean.

146
00:13:35,738 --> 00:13:38,366
Been trying to pin something
to him, but it doesn't work.

147
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:41,069
Trust me.
He's behind all of it.

148
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,840
He runs everything
out of his house by the beach.

149
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:46,507
There were no white gangs
in Venice Beach...

150
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:48,813
before Cameron Alexander
and Derek Vinyard hooked up.

151
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:51,752
Alexander found in Derek
his shining prince.

152
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:54,688
Essentially,
he used Derek to recruit...

153
00:13:54,724 --> 00:13:58,683
a slew of insecure, frustrated,
and impressionable kids.

154
00:13:58,728 --> 00:14:01,822
This kid Vinyard,
he's got a lot of baggage...

155
00:14:01,864 --> 00:14:05,823
as you'll see on this tape
we've gotten courtesy of NBC.

156
00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:14,966
Earlier today, L.A. County
firefighter Dennis Vinyard...

157
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:17,639
was shot and killed
battling a blaze...

158
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,545
at a suspected Compton drug den.

159
00:14:19,582 --> 00:14:21,413
We're at the Vinyard home now...

160
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,384
and Lieutenant Vinyard's
oldest son Derek...

161
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:25,512
has agreed to talk with us
for a moment.

162
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:28,921
Derek, if you could come
down here please for a second.

163
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,986
Look, l know this is tough,
but how do you feel right now?

164
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,498
How do you think l feel?

165
00:14:36,532 --> 00:14:39,467
-l think it's typical.
-Typical how?

166
00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:43,131
Well, this country's becoming
a haven for criminals...

167
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:44,605
so what do you expect?

168
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,835
Decent hard-working Americans
like my dad...

169
00:14:46,876 --> 00:14:49,868
are getting rubbed out
by social parasites.

170
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:51,243
Parasites?

171
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,512
Blacks, browns, yellow,
whatever.

172
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:57,075
l don't understand.

173
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:59,144
You think maybe your father's
murder was race-related?

174
00:14:59,188 --> 00:15:01,088
Yeah, it's race-related.

175
00:15:01,123 --> 00:15:03,023
Every problem in this country
is race-related.

176
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:06,825
Not just crime.
lt's immigration, AlDS, welfare.

177
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:09,057
Those are problems
of the black community...

178
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:10,895
the Hispanic community,
the Asian community.

179
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:12,298
They're not white problems.

180
00:15:12,334 --> 00:15:14,768
Aren't those really issues
that deal more with poverty?

181
00:15:14,804 --> 00:15:18,638
No. They're not products
of their environments.

182
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:20,539
Minorities don't give two shits
about this country.

183
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:23,841
They come here to exploit it,
not to embrace it.

184
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:26,575
Millions of white Europeans
came here and flourished...

185
00:15:26,615 --> 00:15:27,980
within a generation.

186
00:15:28,017 --> 00:15:30,417
What the fuck is the matter
with these people?

187
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:32,478
They have to go around
shooting at firemen.

188
00:15:32,521 --> 00:15:35,513
What does this have to do
with the murder of your father?

189
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:37,958
Because my father was murdered
doing his job!

190
00:15:37,993 --> 00:15:40,393
Putting out a fire in a fucking
nigger neighborhood...

191
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:42,226
he shouldn't
have given a shit about.

192
00:15:42,264 --> 00:15:44,459
He got shot
by a fucking drug dealer...

193
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,968
who probably still collects
a welfare check.

194
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:49,937
Derek Vinyard was quietly
released from Chino...

195
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,271
early this morning after serving
three and some odd years.

196
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:56,073
l think this is something
we gotta keep an eye on.

197
00:15:56,112 --> 00:15:57,670
lf something happens to him...

198
00:15:57,713 --> 00:16:00,705
things could get very ugly
down by the beach.

199
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:02,046
Just keep it low.

200
00:16:03,352 --> 00:16:06,480
Venice Beach
didn't always look like this.

201
00:16:06,522 --> 00:16:09,082
lt used to be
a great neighborhood.

202
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,116
The boardwalk's always
been a dump...

203
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,321
but when my dad moved us
out here...

204
00:16:13,362 --> 00:16:15,796
Venice was a nice,
quiet place to grow up.

205
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,428
Over the years, though,
it's just gone to hell.

206
00:16:20,469 --> 00:16:22,437
The gangs are like a plague.

207
00:16:22,471 --> 00:16:25,770
They moved west from lnglewood
and South Central...

208
00:16:25,808 --> 00:16:27,173
and basically took over.

209
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:28,574
l ain't foulin' you!

210
00:16:35,784 --> 00:16:38,218
l ain't got time
for all this bullshit.

211
00:16:38,254 --> 00:16:39,653
Fuck y'all.

212
00:16:39,688 --> 00:16:40,814
You all right?

213
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:42,016
l'm all right.

214
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:46,528
Yo, is that that fool
you was telling me about?

215
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,530
Yeah, that's that motherfucker.

216
00:16:54,937 --> 00:16:57,167
Yeah, man, that's him.

217
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:08,246
Bitch-ass motherfucker.

218
00:17:08,284 --> 00:17:10,445
That's why Derek started
the D.O.C.

219
00:17:10,486 --> 00:17:13,580
He said white kids shouldn't
have to walk around scared...

220
00:17:13,622 --> 00:17:16,113
in their own neighborhood,
and for a while there...

221
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:18,991
we really made it
like it was ours again.

222
00:17:19,028 --> 00:17:21,622
Throw the ball!

223
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:23,256
Come on, Curtis!

224
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:25,233
Quit chucking it up.
Pass the ball.

225
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:28,932
"D" up!

226
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:30,302
Come on, let's go.

227
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:32,902
Look at this
fucking jungle bunny.

228
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:35,740
He does a spin move every time.

229
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:39,173
You ain't gettin' shit,
motherfucker.

230
00:17:40,783 --> 00:17:42,944
This one's for you, boy!

231
00:17:42,985 --> 00:17:44,213
What the fuck you--

232
00:17:45,487 --> 00:17:47,079
Who you callin' boy,
motherfucker?

233
00:17:47,122 --> 00:17:48,350
You're lucky, motherfucker!

234
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,517
l'm through monkeying around
with your fucking ass!

235
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,187
Pale, pasty, pastrami-eating,
cracker motherfucker.

236
00:17:53,229 --> 00:17:55,288
A hundred bucks
say l make you my bitch.

237
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,291
Hear that?
He's trying to make ends meet...

238
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:02,270
for his cut in welfare.
You're on!

239
00:18:04,073 --> 00:18:05,335
lt's eight-six, Seth.

240
00:18:05,374 --> 00:18:07,535
When l want your opinion,
l'll ask for it.

241
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:10,136
Come on. l can't cover this.
Help me out here.

242
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:11,510
You got a big fucking mouth.

243
00:18:11,547 --> 00:18:13,640
l can take this niglet down.

244
00:18:13,682 --> 00:18:16,207
You couldn't take a shit.
What are you thinking?

245
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:17,776
l will beat him.
Give me the money.

246
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,014
Shut up.

247
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:20,885
You're gonna
fucking embarrass us.

248
00:18:28,998 --> 00:18:31,057
l'll take care of this.

249
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,034
Yo, l ain't got time for this.

250
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:34,228
Hey!

251
00:18:35,437 --> 00:18:36,734
l got a bet.

252
00:18:37,873 --> 00:18:40,865
l come in this game right now.
Same score...

253
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:43,400
but we play black guys
against the white guys.

254
00:18:48,651 --> 00:18:50,744
Name your price, cracker.

255
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:53,152
No money. For these courts.

256
00:18:53,188 --> 00:18:55,088
And not just today. For good.

257
00:18:55,124 --> 00:18:57,183
lf you win,
we will walk away...

258
00:18:57,226 --> 00:19:01,128
but if we win,
no bitching, no fighting.

259
00:19:01,163 --> 00:19:04,155
Right here in front of
everybody, pack up your shit...

260
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:06,190
and get your black asses
out of here.

261
00:19:06,235 --> 00:19:07,930
Fuck that. Take this bet.

262
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,460
Eight to six. Our ball.

263
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:11,200
Let's go.

264
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:28,078
Pick him up!

265
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,155
Seth,
get back and play some "D."

266
00:19:53,315 --> 00:19:54,475
Defense!

267
00:20:02,591 --> 00:20:04,889
Pass the fucking ball!
l was wide open!

268
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:21,674
Bullshit.
That's fuckin' offense.

269
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,473
Get out of here.
He moved his feet.

270
00:20:23,512 --> 00:20:26,504
You want to go, l'm ready!
Don't throw elbows at me!

271
00:20:26,548 --> 00:20:28,914
You want to go, Adolf Hitler
wannabe motherfucker?

272
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:42,857
-You OK?
-Yeah. Give me some water.

273
00:20:42,898 --> 00:20:44,957
You gotta call offense
on that shit.

274
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,797
Not on game point, Danny.

275
00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:49,030
You can't let those niggers
get away with that shit.

276
00:20:49,071 --> 00:20:50,231
lt's game point.

277
00:20:50,272 --> 00:20:52,001
Shut 'em down. Kick some ass.

278
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,372
Watch this.

279
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,192
Bye-bye.

280
00:21:49,231 --> 00:21:51,096
Get the fuck off my court!

281
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:52,361
This is my house!

282
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:53,732
Fuck you, bitch!

283
00:22:05,781 --> 00:22:07,715
Get the fuck out of here!

284
00:22:07,749 --> 00:22:09,273
This is my court!

285
00:22:19,528 --> 00:22:22,224
Derek wouldn't let us visit him
in prison.

286
00:22:22,264 --> 00:22:24,994
He said it would make it
just too hard for him...

287
00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:28,093
and that if we came,
he wouldn't see us anyhow.

288
00:22:28,136 --> 00:22:30,934
Three years without him,
just wondering.

289
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:36,069
And then at 7:00 this morning...

290
00:22:36,111 --> 00:22:38,773
we picked him up
outside the gate.

291
00:22:45,053 --> 00:22:48,022
The whole ride back,
he didn't say anything.

292
00:22:48,056 --> 00:22:49,546
l wanted to stay home,
but he said...

293
00:22:49,591 --> 00:22:51,286
"No. Go to school.
l'll see you later."

294
00:23:05,774 --> 00:23:08,641
Oh, come on.
Give the guy a break.

295
00:23:08,677 --> 00:23:11,578
What? You too big
to give me a hug, tough guy?

296
00:23:11,613 --> 00:23:13,672
No, man. l just know
you're gonna need someone...

297
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:15,580
to look after you while
you adjust to all this space.

298
00:23:15,617 --> 00:23:16,845
Yeah, right.

299
00:23:18,453 --> 00:23:20,614
This place is smaller
than the old living room.

300
00:23:20,656 --> 00:23:22,351
How you doing? How's school?

301
00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:23,949
lt's good.

302
00:23:23,992 --> 00:23:26,017
You gotta do something
about that hair.

303
00:23:26,061 --> 00:23:27,528
That do's gotta go.

304
00:23:27,563 --> 00:23:30,157
-The girls like it.
-Well, l don't.

305
00:23:30,198 --> 00:23:33,599
You're keeping it pretty close.
You took it all the way down.

306
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:36,595
Shit. Look. l forgot, man.

307
00:23:37,873 --> 00:23:40,103
lt hurt like shit
when they put it on.

308
00:23:40,142 --> 00:23:42,076
When'd you get that?

309
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,340
l got it about a month ago.

310
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:46,074
Cameron made it official.

311
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:51,747
He put this on you?

312
00:23:57,759 --> 00:23:58,885
What?

313
00:23:58,927 --> 00:24:01,361
Oh, hi. He's here.

314
00:24:01,396 --> 00:24:03,057
Derek, it's for you.

315
00:24:03,098 --> 00:24:05,464
Nothing.

316
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,333
ls there a phone in the back?
l'll get it in the back.

317
00:24:16,445 --> 00:24:19,471
l got it. Yeah?

318
00:24:19,514 --> 00:24:20,640
Oh, hey.

319
00:24:23,285 --> 00:24:24,809
What?

320
00:24:24,853 --> 00:24:27,344
My eyes have seen the glory...

321
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:29,448
of the trampling at the zoo.

322
00:24:29,491 --> 00:24:32,483
We've washed ourselves
in nigger's blood...

323
00:24:32,527 --> 00:24:35,052
and all the mongrels, too.

324
00:24:35,097 --> 00:24:37,793
We're taking down
the Zog machine...

325
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,926
Jew by Jew by Jew.

326
00:24:39,968 --> 00:24:43,904
The white man marches on.

327
00:24:43,939 --> 00:24:46,908
You think our friend
was behind that?

328
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:49,967
l don't even care.

329
00:24:50,012 --> 00:24:52,173
l'm gonna take care
of that tonight.

330
00:24:52,214 --> 00:24:56,275
My sweet kids. My baby boy.

331
00:24:56,318 --> 00:24:59,185
God, what's with
the love fest, you guys?

332
00:25:04,292 --> 00:25:07,750
No. He'll do it.
l'll make sure he does it.

333
00:25:07,796 --> 00:25:09,423
l'll get it.

334
00:25:16,304 --> 00:25:17,965
l came to see the man.

335
00:25:18,006 --> 00:25:21,305
-Can you fit through the door?
-Fuck you!

336
00:25:23,245 --> 00:25:25,770
What's up, Dan? How you doing?

337
00:25:25,814 --> 00:25:28,305
-Where's Derek?
-He's on the phone.

338
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,717
Come out, you free motherfucker!
Where the fuck are you?

339
00:25:31,753 --> 00:25:35,052
Hang on. Give me a minute.

340
00:25:36,191 --> 00:25:38,125
l'll be out in a minute.

341
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:54,073
l'll be careful.

342
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:57,875
l'm not gonna stay
in my room the rest of my life.

343
00:25:57,913 --> 00:25:59,710
Hold on.

344
00:25:59,748 --> 00:26:03,184
Hey. What the fuck
is Seth doing here?

345
00:26:03,218 --> 00:26:05,049
Did you invite him over?

346
00:26:05,087 --> 00:26:07,248
No. He always comes over here.

347
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,290
Danny, give me a minute.

348
00:26:11,326 --> 00:26:13,521
Just give me one minute.

349
00:26:33,215 --> 00:26:35,206
Are you still here, Goodyear?

350
00:26:36,618 --> 00:26:39,553
You calling me a blimp,
you fucking Democrat?

351
00:26:40,689 --> 00:26:44,022
When was the last time you were
actually able to see your feet?

352
00:26:46,762 --> 00:26:48,354
Come in here, Danny.

353
00:26:53,168 --> 00:26:55,534
Are you going to Cam's party
tonight?

354
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,902
ls Davina's ass watertight?

355
00:26:57,939 --> 00:26:59,804
You're fucking sick, man.

356
00:26:59,841 --> 00:27:02,867
All right, relax.
Let me ask you a few questions.

357
00:27:02,911 --> 00:27:05,141
l'm not in the mood.
l got homework.

358
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,013
Tell me some of the shit
you've learned, fuckass...

359
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:09,710
before l pistol-whip you.

360
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:12,811
OK. l believe in death,
destruction...

361
00:27:12,854 --> 00:27:15,049
chaos, filth, and greed.

362
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:18,821
Cut the shit, Dan. Come on.
Tell me what l want to hear.

363
00:27:19,895 --> 00:27:21,863
You mean that shit
about your mother?

364
00:27:21,897 --> 00:27:24,764
You want to get
fucking beaten, Danny?

365
00:27:26,434 --> 00:27:29,870
l'm not fucking talking to you.
Shut up.

366
00:27:29,905 --> 00:27:32,635
Look, you gotta let me do this
my own way, all right?

367
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:36,071
l'll take care of it.

368
00:27:36,111 --> 00:27:38,045
Who do you hate, Danny?

369
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,207
l hate anyone
that isn't white Protestant.

370
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:42,238
Why?

371
00:27:42,284 --> 00:27:44,912
They're a burden to the
advancement of the white race.

372
00:27:44,953 --> 00:27:46,215
Some are all right.

373
00:27:46,254 --> 00:27:48,586
None of them
are fucking all right, OK?

374
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:51,854
They're all a bunch
of fucking freeloaders.

375
00:27:51,893 --> 00:27:54,259
We don't know 'em.
We don't want to know 'em.

376
00:27:54,296 --> 00:27:55,524
They're the fucking enemy.

377
00:27:57,999 --> 00:27:59,728
What don't you like
about them...

378
00:27:59,768 --> 00:28:01,702
and say it with
some fucking conviction.

379
00:28:01,736 --> 00:28:04,967
l hate the fact it's cool
to be black these days.

380
00:28:05,006 --> 00:28:06,132
Good.

381
00:28:06,174 --> 00:28:10,235
l hate this hip-hop influence
on white fucking surburbia.

382
00:28:10,278 --> 00:28:11,836
Good.

383
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,010
l hate Tabitha Soren and
her Zionist MTV fucking pigs...

384
00:28:16,051 --> 00:28:17,643
telling us we should get along.

385
00:28:17,686 --> 00:28:20,814
Save the rhetorical bullshit,
Hillary Rodham Clinton...

386
00:28:20,856 --> 00:28:22,619
'cause it ain't gonna
fucking happen.

387
00:28:22,657 --> 00:28:24,784
That's some of the best shit
l've ever heard.

388
00:28:24,826 --> 00:28:28,421
l feel sorry for you, Danny.

389
00:28:28,463 --> 00:28:30,590
You don't believe
any of that shit, right?

390
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:31,792
Shut up.

391
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:35,394
No. Get out of the house now,
you piece of shit.

392
00:28:35,437 --> 00:28:38,167
ls that any way to talk
to a guest, a friend?

393
00:28:38,206 --> 00:28:40,367
Derek hates you,
and you don't realize it.

394
00:28:40,408 --> 00:28:42,933
How do you know who l hate?

395
00:28:42,978 --> 00:28:46,345
Back from the dead.
God bless Jesus Christ.

396
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:48,781
God, l think you lost weight.

397
00:28:48,817 --> 00:28:51,012
l can get my arms almost
all the way around you.

398
00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:55,148
Fifty fuckin' pounds, man.
Look at this hair. Holy shit.

399
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,318
l told him it's gotta go.

400
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,453
Grab your jacket.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

401
00:29:00,495 --> 00:29:04,659
l want to talk to him.
One second.

402
00:29:04,699 --> 00:29:09,602
Hey, listen. Did you pull
some shit in school today?

403
00:29:09,638 --> 00:29:12,801
-Just the usual.
-This kid is awesome as hell.

404
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:15,776
Did you turn in a paper
on "Mein Kampf"?

405
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:20,343
-Sweeney shit his pants.
-He did, man.

406
00:29:20,382 --> 00:29:23,408
Was that your idea or
did Cameron put you up to that?

407
00:29:23,451 --> 00:29:26,284
No. l thought it would be cool.
How'd you know?

408
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:28,482
lt doesn't matter how l knew.

409
00:29:28,523 --> 00:29:30,821
This kid is smart as hell.

410
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:32,884
Was that Sweeney on the phone?

411
00:29:32,928 --> 00:29:34,793
Sweeney called and told me.

412
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:37,821
God, l hate
that fucking nigger, man.

413
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:39,356
He's gotta get a fucking life.

414
00:29:40,602 --> 00:29:42,297
Sweeney's a good teacher.

415
00:29:42,337 --> 00:29:44,498
Sweeney is a nigger
on a power trip.

416
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:46,598
That's what he was like
when we were there...

417
00:29:46,641 --> 00:29:49,132
and that's how he is now.
lt'll never change.

418
00:29:49,177 --> 00:29:50,337
Fuck that nigger!

419
00:29:50,378 --> 00:29:52,471
-Seth, go away.
-Are you kidding?

420
00:29:52,514 --> 00:29:55,847
Nope. Wait in Danny's room.
l want to talk to my brother.

421
00:29:55,884 --> 00:29:58,717
l've been here 15 minutes.
l'm starving.

422
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:06,826
Come here. Seriously, look.
Forget this yahoo.

423
00:30:06,861 --> 00:30:09,796
He kills bugs for a living.
You don't want to be like that.

424
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:11,389
l'm serious. lt's not funny.

425
00:30:11,433 --> 00:30:13,765
Sweeney is a good teacher.
You can learn a lot from him.

426
00:30:13,802 --> 00:30:16,999
Don't go fuck it up
with small fry shit like that.

427
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:18,403
You don't understand.

428
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,567
You got to see the bullshit
paper he's making me write.

429
00:30:20,608 --> 00:30:23,133
He told me all about it.
l don't care.

430
00:30:23,178 --> 00:30:25,908
You do anything he tells you
to do. l mean it.

431
00:30:25,947 --> 00:30:28,006
l don't want you getting
in trouble in school...

432
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:31,416
trying to impress me,
taking this shit in there.

433
00:30:31,453 --> 00:30:33,216
Do you understand
what l'm saying?

434
00:30:33,254 --> 00:30:36,985
Yeah, l guess, but, l mean,
l thought you'd be happy.

435
00:30:37,025 --> 00:30:38,458
Well, l'm not.

436
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:42,294
Listen to that.

437
00:30:43,164 --> 00:30:46,224
Yeah, l know.
lt's been getting worse.

438
00:30:46,267 --> 00:30:47,666
Don't worry about it.

439
00:30:47,702 --> 00:30:49,602
l'll talk to you
about this later.

440
00:30:52,607 --> 00:30:54,507
She's coughing her lungs out...

441
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:57,170
and you're blowing this
in her face all day.

442
00:30:57,212 --> 00:30:58,440
l'm putting it out.

443
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,916
Hey, come on.
l want to talk to you.

444
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:09,313
Mommy, are you OK?

445
00:31:15,163 --> 00:31:16,858
Put that out.

446
00:31:16,898 --> 00:31:20,129
l was just yelling at him
for blowing smoke in your face.

447
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:22,363
Nice thing to come home to, huh?

448
00:31:24,906 --> 00:31:26,203
You all right?

449
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:28,402
You all right?

450
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:37,040
Look, you got to take it easy.

451
00:31:37,085 --> 00:31:38,985
You got to get some rest.

452
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,147
Take Danny's and my room,
and we'll hit the couch.

453
00:31:41,189 --> 00:31:44,090
l've been on the couch for ages.
The couch is fine.

454
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:45,990
No, it's not fine.
This is terrible.

455
00:31:46,027 --> 00:31:49,793
We can't live like this.
We gotta get out of here.

456
00:31:51,933 --> 00:31:54,094
Can l go with you?

457
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:57,434
Yeah.
We all gotta get out of here.

458
00:31:57,472 --> 00:32:00,999
-l could drop out and get a job.
-Absolutely not.

459
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:03,010
You got to finish.
l'll work something out.

460
00:32:06,614 --> 00:32:11,449
Derek, can we please go eat?
l'm fucking starving here.

461
00:32:11,486 --> 00:32:13,283
Go wait in the living room.

462
00:32:14,456 --> 00:32:16,617
l want him out of my house.

463
00:32:16,658 --> 00:32:18,148
l know. Look.

464
00:32:33,408 --> 00:32:36,377
He's an idiot.
He's always been an idiot.

465
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:39,107
He can't help it.
l got to do that paper.

466
00:32:39,147 --> 00:32:41,479
l'll catch up with you
later tonight.

467
00:32:41,516 --> 00:32:44,644
Not at Cameron's. l need you
to stay away from there.

468
00:32:44,686 --> 00:32:48,144
-We were going to hang.
-l'll explain it later.

469
00:32:48,189 --> 00:32:50,657
l just need you to stay away
from the party, all right?

470
00:32:50,692 --> 00:32:51,818
Whatever.

471
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,455
Promise me you'll stay away
from that party tonight.

472
00:32:55,497 --> 00:32:57,761
l'm not fucking 14 anymore,
all right?

473
00:32:58,967 --> 00:33:00,264
Whatever.

474
00:33:02,237 --> 00:33:03,226
God!

475
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:11,039
Come on, let's go.

476
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,977
Where are you parked?

477
00:33:14,015 --> 00:33:15,277
Out back.

478
00:34:24,285 --> 00:34:26,014
Yeah, that's the whole bunch.

479
00:34:27,422 --> 00:34:30,323
lt didn't take long for Derek
to make a name for himself...

480
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:32,485
and Cameron knew
just how to use it.

481
00:34:32,527 --> 00:34:33,858
You don't want to stick around?

482
00:34:33,895 --> 00:34:37,991
You know l'd love to,
but l got to be careful.

483
00:34:38,032 --> 00:34:40,000
Yeah, l know.

484
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:42,568
l'll see you back at the house.

485
00:34:43,972 --> 00:34:45,337
Good luck.

486
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:49,332
He sent Derek to the kids,
to the frustrated ones...

487
00:34:49,377 --> 00:34:51,208
the ones who were sick
of getting their asses kicked...

488
00:34:51,246 --> 00:34:53,646
by black and Mexican gangs.

489
00:34:53,681 --> 00:34:56,548
"Don't just be some punk.
Be part of something."

490
00:34:56,584 --> 00:34:59,451
All right, let's go.
Pull it together.

491
00:34:59,487 --> 00:35:01,182
And everybody ate it up.

492
00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:03,622
They did whatever Derek
told them to.

493
00:35:04,626 --> 00:35:06,924
Let's go. We're not here
to fucking socialize.

494
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,958
Shut the fuck up.

495
00:35:09,998 --> 00:35:11,226
Yeah, man.

496
00:35:11,266 --> 00:35:12,597
You want a little toke?

497
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:15,467
Go ahead.

498
00:35:15,503 --> 00:35:18,097
-Curtis, what is that?
-Come on, Derek.

499
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:20,903
Weed is for niggers.
Put that away right now.

500
00:35:20,942 --> 00:35:22,170
Jesus fucking Christ.

501
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,643
Have a little self-respect.

502
00:35:25,113 --> 00:35:29,049
All right, listen up.
We need to open our eyes.

503
00:35:30,418 --> 00:35:32,978
There's over two million
illegal immigrants...

504
00:35:33,021 --> 00:35:35,546
bedding down
in this state tonight.

505
00:35:36,991 --> 00:35:40,552
This state spent three
billion dollars last year...

506
00:35:40,595 --> 00:35:43,928
on services for those people
who had no right to be here.

507
00:35:43,965 --> 00:35:45,557
Three billion dollars.

508
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,094
$400 million just to lock up
illegal immigrant criminals...

509
00:35:50,138 --> 00:35:53,904
who only got into this country
because the lNS decided...

510
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:57,968
it's not worth the effort
to screen for convicted felons.

511
00:35:59,981 --> 00:36:02,415
Our government
doesn't give a shit.

512
00:36:03,951 --> 00:36:08,285
Our border policy is a joke,
so is anybody surprised...

513
00:36:08,323 --> 00:36:10,621
that south of the border
they're laughing at us?

514
00:36:10,658 --> 00:36:12,922
Laughing at our laws?

515
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,723
Every night, thousands
of these parasites...

516
00:36:14,762 --> 00:36:17,663
stream across the border like
some fucking piñata exploded.

517
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:21,328
Don't laugh.
There's nothing funny here.

518
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:23,394
This is about your life
and mine.

519
00:36:24,806 --> 00:36:26,899
lt's about decent,
hard-working Americans...

520
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:28,806
falling through the cracks
and getting the shaft...

521
00:36:28,843 --> 00:36:32,279
because their government
cares more about the rights...

522
00:36:32,313 --> 00:36:34,611
of a bunch of people
who aren't even citizens.

523
00:36:34,649 --> 00:36:36,674
On the Statue of Liberty
it says...

524
00:36:36,718 --> 00:36:39,414
"Give me your tired,
your hungry, your poor."

525
00:36:39,454 --> 00:36:42,116
Well, it's Americans who are
tired and hungry and poor.

526
00:36:42,156 --> 00:36:44,317
Until you take care of that...

527
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:47,351
close the fucking book,
because we're losing.

528
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:51,887
We're losing our right
to pursue our destiny.

529
00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:55,369
We're losing our freedom so
a bunch of fucking foreigners...

530
00:36:55,403 --> 00:36:57,564
can come in here
and exploit our country.

531
00:36:57,605 --> 00:37:00,699
And this isn't something
that's going on far away.

532
00:37:00,742 --> 00:37:03,802
This isn't happening places
we can't do anything about it.

533
00:37:03,845 --> 00:37:06,279
lt's happening here.
Right in our neighborhood.

534
00:37:06,314 --> 00:37:08,407
Right in that building
behind you.

535
00:37:08,449 --> 00:37:11,907
Archie Miller ran that grocery
store since we were kids here.

536
00:37:11,953 --> 00:37:14,820
Dave worked there.
Mike worked there.

537
00:37:14,856 --> 00:37:17,222
He went under, and now
some fucking Korean owns it...

538
00:37:17,258 --> 00:37:19,749
who fired these guys
and is making a killing...

539
00:37:19,794 --> 00:37:23,127
because he hired
40 fucking border jumpers.

540
00:37:23,164 --> 00:37:24,563
l see this shit going on...

541
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:26,590
and l don't see anybody
doing anything about it...

542
00:37:26,634 --> 00:37:28,534
and it fucking pisses me off.

543
00:37:30,705 --> 00:37:32,639
So look around you.

544
00:37:33,908 --> 00:37:35,034
This isn't
our fucking neighborhood.

545
00:37:35,076 --> 00:37:37,806
lt's a battlefield.
We're on a battlefield tonight.

546
00:37:37,845 --> 00:37:39,540
Make a decision.

547
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,242
Are we going to stand
on the sidelines?

548
00:37:42,283 --> 00:37:44,945
Quietly standing there
while our country gets raped?

549
00:37:45,987 --> 00:37:48,854
Are we going to ante up
and do something about it?

550
00:37:50,324 --> 00:37:51,723
You're goddamn right.

551
00:38:04,338 --> 00:38:06,966
Come here!
Don't you know it's illegal...

552
00:38:07,008 --> 00:38:09,636
to hire fucking border jumpers,
you nip bastard?

553
00:38:17,385 --> 00:38:18,852
Hey, sweetheart.

554
00:38:18,886 --> 00:38:21,081
No. You don't need this.
We're not going to hurt you.

555
00:38:21,122 --> 00:38:22,714
Please, please! No!

556
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,888
You fucking spic!

557
00:38:29,797 --> 00:38:32,459
-No! Please!
-This bitch deserves it.

558
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,766
This bitch stinks. Smells like
fish and chips and guacamole.

559
00:38:36,804 --> 00:38:38,237
Here we go.

560
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:51,012
Goddamn!

561
00:38:55,022 --> 00:38:56,717
Get the fuck off me,
motherfucker!

562
00:39:04,065 --> 00:39:05,623
Viva la Mexico!

563
00:39:10,438 --> 00:39:12,463
Have a fucking bean,
you fucking beaner!

564
00:39:20,114 --> 00:39:23,413
Get some of that in there.
Throw it on.

565
00:39:23,451 --> 00:39:25,351
That's a great color on you.

566
00:39:25,386 --> 00:39:27,320
Now you can get
a white woman's job.

567
00:39:27,355 --> 00:39:29,346
A little better
than this one, huh?

568
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,982
Yeah, white.

569
00:39:31,025 --> 00:39:32,856
Then you'll move up
in the world.

570
00:39:34,562 --> 00:39:35,859
Asshole!

571
00:39:37,832 --> 00:39:38,958
Let's go!

572
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,558
Everybody out!

573
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:42,091
Now! Now!

574
00:39:45,072 --> 00:39:46,937
All right, let's go!

575
00:39:46,974 --> 00:39:48,464
Come on!

576
00:39:48,509 --> 00:39:50,067
Come on, let's go.

577
00:39:55,249 --> 00:39:58,582
No green card, no fucking work.
Comprende?

578
00:40:01,022 --> 00:40:02,148
Come on!

579
00:40:02,189 --> 00:40:04,180
We're fucking going! Come on!

580
00:40:30,518 --> 00:40:34,454
Dad was gone, but things
were almost normal again.

581
00:40:34,488 --> 00:40:36,217
Derek had a good job.

582
00:40:36,257 --> 00:40:38,020
Mom was starting
to live a little.

583
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:42,325
Everyone was feeling so good,
we just didn't see it coming.

584
00:40:42,363 --> 00:40:44,092
Maybe we should've.

585
00:40:44,131 --> 00:40:46,429
The irony is
that most of the stores...

586
00:40:46,467 --> 00:40:49,061
destroyed during the riots
were owned by black people.

587
00:40:49,103 --> 00:40:52,197
That's stupid, though.
Why trash your own neighborhood?

588
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:55,208
Well, that's my point.
lt's an irrational act.

589
00:40:55,242 --> 00:40:57,369
lt's like an expression
of rage...

590
00:40:57,411 --> 00:41:01,347
by people who feel neglected
and turned away by the system.

591
00:41:01,382 --> 00:41:06,945
lt's like we had in Watts
or the riots in Chicago in '68.

592
00:41:06,988 --> 00:41:08,512
l don't buy that.

593
00:41:08,556 --> 00:41:11,047
Calling a riot an irrational
expression of rage.

594
00:41:11,092 --> 00:41:13,959
That's such a cop-out.
lt's opportunism at its worst.

595
00:41:13,995 --> 00:41:16,225
lt's people grabbing
any excuse they can find...

596
00:41:16,263 --> 00:41:18,094
to go and loot a store,
nothing more.

597
00:41:18,132 --> 00:41:20,430
The fact that these people
ripped off the stores...

598
00:41:20,468 --> 00:41:22,436
in their own communities,
all that reflects...

599
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:25,405
is that they have no respect
for the law at all...

600
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:28,067
and certainly no concept
of community...

601
00:41:28,109 --> 00:41:29,770
or civic responsibility.

602
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:30,970
Now wait a minute.

603
00:41:31,012 --> 00:41:33,537
White people commit crimes
against white people, too.

604
00:41:33,581 --> 00:41:37,039
Yeah, but they're not offing
each other in record numbers.

605
00:41:37,084 --> 00:41:39,052
Look at the statistics,
for Christ's sake.

606
00:41:39,086 --> 00:41:41,247
One in every three
black males...

607
00:41:41,288 --> 00:41:43,620
is in some phase
of the correctional system.

608
00:41:43,658 --> 00:41:44,920
ls that a coincidence...

609
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:47,792
or do these people have
a racial commitment to crime?

610
00:41:47,828 --> 00:41:50,126
Not only that.
They're proud of it.

611
00:41:50,164 --> 00:41:52,291
Maybe it says something
about prejudice...

612
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:53,493
in the judicial system.

613
00:41:53,534 --> 00:41:55,798
lf you want to talk
about criminal statistics...

614
00:41:55,836 --> 00:41:59,328
take a look at the social
inequalities that produce them.

615
00:41:59,373 --> 00:42:01,432
That's exactly what l hate.

616
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:04,535
You're taking one thing
and calling it something else...

617
00:42:04,578 --> 00:42:06,978
and just alleviating
the responsibility...

618
00:42:07,014 --> 00:42:08,572
these people have
for their own actions.

619
00:42:08,616 --> 00:42:12,017
lt's like saying,
it's not a riot, it's rage.

620
00:42:12,053 --> 00:42:15,580
lt's not crime, it's poverty.
That's just nonsense.

621
00:42:15,623 --> 00:42:17,557
lt's exactly what happened
in this trial...

622
00:42:17,591 --> 00:42:19,354
because the media
twisted things around...

623
00:42:19,393 --> 00:42:22,055
so people got all focused
on these cops...

624
00:42:22,096 --> 00:42:23,427
and whether or not they were
going to get convicted...

625
00:42:23,464 --> 00:42:26,627
and whether Rodney King's
civil rights had been violated.

626
00:42:26,667 --> 00:42:28,862
Everybody lost sight
of old Rodney King himself.

627
00:42:28,903 --> 00:42:31,997
The guy's a multiple felon
by his own admission.

628
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:33,870
He's high as a goddamn kite...

629
00:42:33,908 --> 00:42:36,570
driving 120 miles an hour
down the highway.

630
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:38,635
He gets pulled over
by a bunch of cops...

631
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:40,112
and he attacks them.

632
00:42:40,147 --> 00:42:41,478
He attacked police officers.

633
00:42:41,515 --> 00:42:42,982
That's the bottom line,
and he walked.

634
00:42:43,017 --> 00:42:45,349
And there's some yahoo there
with a video camera...

635
00:42:45,386 --> 00:42:46,751
who turned it on
halfway through...

636
00:42:46,787 --> 00:42:49,119
so that all we see
is them hitting him.

637
00:42:49,156 --> 00:42:52,785
You got Powell and Koon
cracking him with billy clubs...

638
00:42:52,827 --> 00:42:55,091
and Briseno's kicking him
in the back of the skull...

639
00:42:55,129 --> 00:42:56,528
so it looks severe, you know?

640
00:42:56,564 --> 00:42:57,861
People are going,
"Oh, this poor guy."

641
00:42:57,898 --> 00:42:59,889
This poor guy
who attacked four cops...

642
00:42:59,934 --> 00:43:01,765
and those cops
end up on the stand...

643
00:43:01,802 --> 00:43:06,398
defending themselves for using
standard textbook procedures.

644
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,533
l don't think the tapes
showed that at all.

645
00:43:08,576 --> 00:43:11,670
You didn't think so?
And you're an authority?

646
00:43:11,712 --> 00:43:14,010
Murray, what do you think?

647
00:43:15,716 --> 00:43:19,618
l did think the police used
their clubs rather excessively.

648
00:43:19,653 --> 00:43:21,348
Who are you
to say what's excessive?

649
00:43:21,388 --> 00:43:23,049
l think it was
totally appropriate.

650
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:26,150
They're in a better position
to make that call than you are.

651
00:43:26,193 --> 00:43:29,993
We, as society, grant cops
a certain amount of authority...

652
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:32,225
to make those calls,
because we acknowledge...

653
00:43:32,266 --> 00:43:34,461
that their job is difficult
and dangerous.

654
00:43:34,502 --> 00:43:38,370
Very few people respect that
and respect that authority.

655
00:43:38,405 --> 00:43:41,306
Look who's talking about
respect--Mr. Junior KKK.

656
00:43:41,342 --> 00:43:42,502
What?

657
00:43:44,311 --> 00:43:46,541
You want to go to college?
Learn to listen.

658
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,879
l didn't say l respect the laws.
l acknowledge a cop's authority.

659
00:43:49,917 --> 00:43:53,444
l don't respect laws that let
Rodney King back on the street.

660
00:43:53,487 --> 00:43:56,786
Second, l am not a member
of a low-rent...

661
00:43:56,824 --> 00:44:00,954
disorganized bunch of rednecks
like the fucking KKK. Please.

662
00:44:00,995 --> 00:44:03,759
So take your head
out of your ass.

663
00:44:03,798 --> 00:44:05,595
You've gotten off the point.

664
00:44:05,633 --> 00:44:08,193
l had a point.
That wasn't even the point.

665
00:44:08,235 --> 00:44:10,169
Do you have one?
What is your point?

666
00:44:10,204 --> 00:44:11,967
All right, think about this.

667
00:44:12,006 --> 00:44:14,497
lf Danny was walking
across the street that night...

668
00:44:14,542 --> 00:44:15,770
and Rodney King
plowed into him--

669
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,903
Can we drop
this Rodney King thing?

670
00:44:27,688 --> 00:44:29,315
Who would like some dessert?

671
00:44:31,158 --> 00:44:32,216
We're having a discussion.

672
00:44:32,259 --> 00:44:34,625
We're having
a nice discussion, right?

673
00:44:34,662 --> 00:44:36,129
lf Rodney King
had been driving along...

674
00:44:36,163 --> 00:44:38,154
hopped up on PCP
and had killed Danny...

675
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:39,666
you'd be singing
a different tune--

676
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,669
l didn't see him hit anybody,
and neither did you.

677
00:44:42,703 --> 00:44:45,331
He didn't happen
to kill anybody, thank God.

678
00:44:45,372 --> 00:44:47,863
Keep it down, OK?
Ally's sleeping.

679
00:44:50,778 --> 00:44:54,441
lf that fucking monkey
had run some kid over...

680
00:44:54,481 --> 00:44:57,678
everybody would have
a very different opinion.

681
00:44:57,718 --> 00:45:00,915
They'd be focused on Rodney King
and not on these officers.

682
00:45:00,955 --> 00:45:02,980
But instead,
he just attacked a few cops...

683
00:45:03,023 --> 00:45:04,752
so, suddenly,
it's Hands Across America...

684
00:45:04,792 --> 00:45:06,851
for this fucking total
son of a bitch.

685
00:45:06,894 --> 00:45:08,293
lt blows my mind.

686
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:11,196
We're so hung up on this notion
that we have some obligation...

687
00:45:11,232 --> 00:45:13,291
to help
this struggling black man.

688
00:45:13,334 --> 00:45:15,598
Cut him some slack
until he can overcome...

689
00:45:15,636 --> 00:45:16,967
these historical injustices.

690
00:45:17,004 --> 00:45:19,495
lt's crap. This stuff
just perpetuates it...

691
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,030
all this liberal nonsense.

692
00:45:21,075 --> 00:45:22,542
Everyone's looking
the other way...

693
00:45:22,576 --> 00:45:24,601
while our country rots
from the inside out.

694
00:45:24,645 --> 00:45:28,240
l mean, Christ, Lincoln freed
the slaves 130 years ago.

695
00:45:28,282 --> 00:45:30,341
How long does it take
to get your act together?

696
00:45:30,384 --> 00:45:34,411
Jews have been persecuted
for over 5,000 years.

697
00:45:34,455 --> 00:45:36,855
Are you saying it's wrong
to feel sensitive...

698
00:45:36,891 --> 00:45:38,188
about anti-Semitism?

699
00:45:38,225 --> 00:45:39,556
Oh, forget that.

700
00:45:39,593 --> 00:45:42,653
l'm with you. l'm with you
all the way, baby.

701
00:45:42,696 --> 00:45:44,459
l'm so sick of
these liberal hypocrites.

702
00:45:44,498 --> 00:45:46,659
Here we go again.
l love this part.

703
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,724
This is great.

704
00:45:47,768 --> 00:45:49,702
Look how they scapegoated
Chief Gates.

705
00:45:49,737 --> 00:45:52,365
Think they would've come down
that hard on Willie Williams?

706
00:45:52,406 --> 00:45:55,773
No way. That videotape was
a set-up to get rid of Gates.

707
00:45:55,809 --> 00:45:59,142
-Can l be excused?
-No. Don't interrupt.

708
00:45:59,179 --> 00:46:01,511
Excuse me. l was talking.
l listened to you.

709
00:46:01,548 --> 00:46:05,211
-Who do you think you are?
-She's making a point.

710
00:46:05,252 --> 00:46:07,516
Davina, sit down.

711
00:46:07,554 --> 00:46:10,853
Be quiet! Shut up! Sit down!

712
00:46:10,891 --> 00:46:14,190
-Derek, calm down.
-Don't tell him to shut up!

713
00:46:14,228 --> 00:46:17,095
Sit your ass down. No.
Sit down. Shut your mouth.

714
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:19,759
Move! Goddamn it! Move!

715
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,064
Shut your mouth and give
my girlfriend respect.

716
00:46:22,102 --> 00:46:24,502
Derek, what are you
trying to prove?

717
00:46:24,538 --> 00:46:26,199
Murray, stay out of it!

718
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,367
Where do you think you're going?

719
00:46:28,409 --> 00:46:31,242
Derek, let her go!

720
00:46:31,278 --> 00:46:34,770
You need to learn
some fucking manners, Davina!

721
00:46:34,815 --> 00:46:37,181
Shut your fucking mouth!

722
00:46:37,217 --> 00:46:38,411
Stop!

723
00:46:39,586 --> 00:46:40,814
She can't breathe!

724
00:46:42,756 --> 00:46:43,882
Let her go!

725
00:46:43,924 --> 00:46:45,949
You going to apologize?

726
00:46:47,928 --> 00:46:51,125
You're a fucking asshole.
l hate you!

727
00:47:01,008 --> 00:47:03,238
What are you doing?
This is your family.

728
00:47:03,277 --> 00:47:05,211
Right.
My family, so you know what?

729
00:47:05,245 --> 00:47:08,612
l don't give two shits about you
or what you think.

730
00:47:08,649 --> 00:47:10,446
You're not a part of it.

731
00:47:10,484 --> 00:47:12,884
-That has nothing to do with it.
-lt doesn't?

732
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,751
You don't think
l see what you're doing?

733
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:16,346
You think
l'll sit here and smile...

734
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:18,881
while some fucking kike
tries to fuck my mother?

735
00:47:18,926 --> 00:47:21,861
lt's never going to happen.
Fucking forget it.

736
00:47:21,895 --> 00:47:23,726
Not while l'm in this family.

737
00:47:23,764 --> 00:47:25,823
l will fucking cut
your Shylock nose off...

738
00:47:25,866 --> 00:47:28,596
and stick it up your ass
before l let that happen.

739
00:47:28,635 --> 00:47:31,126
Coming in here and poisoning
my family's dinner...

740
00:47:31,171 --> 00:47:34,436
with your Jewish,
nigger-loving, hippie bullshit.

741
00:47:37,945 --> 00:47:40,914
Fuck you. Fuck you.

742
00:47:40,948 --> 00:47:42,745
Yeah, walk out.

743
00:47:42,783 --> 00:47:45,308
Asshole. Fucking
cabala-reading motherfucker.

744
00:47:45,352 --> 00:47:46,876
Get out of my house.

745
00:47:51,892 --> 00:47:54,087
You see this?
That means not welcome.

746
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,866
What did l do?

747
00:48:07,908 --> 00:48:09,899
You disgust me.

748
00:48:09,943 --> 00:48:12,605
Bring him to our table, primping
your hair and your dress.

749
00:48:12,646 --> 00:48:14,841
What did l do?

750
00:48:14,882 --> 00:48:16,850
You're all tarted up.

751
00:48:16,884 --> 00:48:18,579
How could you bring him
to my father's table?

752
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:21,816
How could you go from Dad
to that? Aren't you ashamed?

753
00:48:21,855 --> 00:48:25,256
l'm ashamed that you
came out of my body!

754
00:48:28,695 --> 00:48:31,596
Go run to your fucking kike!
Run to him !

755
00:48:37,671 --> 00:48:40,640
lt's OK.
l'm proud of you, baby.

756
00:48:47,381 --> 00:48:50,942
l'm so sorry, Doris.
l really am.

757
00:48:59,226 --> 00:49:00,318
He's gone.

758
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:05,161
He's just a boy
without a father.

759
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:08,930
Doris, you don't know the world
your children are living in.

760
00:49:18,812 --> 00:49:20,439
Good-bye.

761
00:50:05,893 --> 00:50:07,485
Hey, you all right?

762
00:50:10,164 --> 00:50:13,133
-Take this, you fucking dick!
-No. Come here.

763
00:50:13,167 --> 00:50:14,725
-Fuck you!
-Calm down.

764
00:50:14,768 --> 00:50:16,133
-Let go of me!
-Calm down.

765
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:17,432
Let me go, God damn it!

766
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,666
-Fuck you!
-l'm sorry.

767
00:50:21,241 --> 00:50:23,607
l would never hurt you.
You know that.

768
00:50:23,644 --> 00:50:27,273
l screwed up. l lost control.
lt's not you.

769
00:50:27,314 --> 00:50:30,477
l'm sorry.
l'd never hurt you guys.

770
00:50:30,517 --> 00:50:33,179
You know that.
l'd do anything for you.

771
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,551
l don't believe you.

772
00:50:34,588 --> 00:50:36,920
l trust you, Derek.

773
00:50:48,135 --> 00:50:51,366
What are you doing out of bed?
Want a plane ride?

774
00:50:51,405 --> 00:50:54,340
-Yeah.
-Going for takeoff.

775
00:51:00,514 --> 00:51:01,913
Oh, no, don't crash.

776
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:06,981
Better go to Mom.
She's a crazy flier.

777
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:10,012
Kiss Mom. Oh, yeah.

778
00:51:18,632 --> 00:51:21,931
-You don't feel too hot.
-No. lt's my chest.

779
00:51:21,969 --> 00:51:24,494
-What are you up to?
-l'm just thinking.

780
00:51:24,538 --> 00:51:27,006
Yeah? There's a lot of that
going around.

781
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,907
l don't even know
how we got here sometimes.

782
00:51:29,943 --> 00:51:32,707
l feel like l let you down, only
l didn't know when it happened.

783
00:51:32,746 --> 00:51:34,441
Mom, it's OK.

784
00:51:38,418 --> 00:51:40,386
lt's cold in here.
No wonder you're sick.

785
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:43,082
You don't get sick from cold.
You get sick from germs.

786
00:51:43,123 --> 00:51:45,887
No. You get sick from smoking.

787
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:50,587
You ought to quit.
lt's not good for you.

788
00:51:56,336 --> 00:51:58,361
What are you looking at me
like that for?

789
00:51:58,405 --> 00:52:01,101
When are you going to let
that beautiful hair grow back?

790
00:52:02,909 --> 00:52:04,968
The day you quit smoking.

791
00:52:08,015 --> 00:52:09,573
Deal.

792
00:52:09,616 --> 00:52:14,383
l'd better get Ally to bed.
You say good night to Mom?

793
00:52:14,421 --> 00:52:16,548
Then you have to go to bed.
Come on.

794
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:19,081
-Good night, Mama.
-Good night, baby.

795
00:52:53,427 --> 00:52:56,988
l go back to that night
again and again in my mind.

796
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:59,328
l try to stop it from happening.

797
00:52:59,366 --> 00:53:01,231
l want you out of this house.

798
00:53:01,268 --> 00:53:03,236
That's fine.
l'll be gone in the morning.

799
00:53:04,604 --> 00:53:05,901
He can move in with me.

800
00:53:07,274 --> 00:53:09,538
ln my mind, l imagine
what would've happened...

801
00:53:09,576 --> 00:53:12,977
if l hadn't gone to that room
and told him.

802
00:53:14,314 --> 00:53:15,508
Get down!

803
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:18,215
No, Derek!

804
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,254
Help, Mommy!

805
00:53:36,236 --> 00:53:39,535
Nigger, you just fucked
with the wrong bull. Come here!

806
00:53:39,573 --> 00:53:40,665
Damn!

807
00:53:40,707 --> 00:53:44,143
Should've learned your place on
the fucking baskeball court...

808
00:53:44,177 --> 00:53:45,906
but you fucking monkeys
never get the message!

809
00:53:47,547 --> 00:53:49,913
My father gave me that truck,
you motherfucker!

810
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:53,613
You ever shoot at firemen?
You shoot at my family?

811
00:53:53,653 --> 00:53:56,053
l'm going to teach you a real
lesson now, motherfucker.

812
00:53:56,089 --> 00:53:58,319
Put your fucking mouth
on the curb.

813
00:53:58,358 --> 00:53:59,325
Hold on, man.

814
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:02,294
Put it on the curb right now!

815
00:54:05,732 --> 00:54:06,699
That's it.

816
00:54:06,733 --> 00:54:08,496
Derek, no!

817
00:54:12,939 --> 00:54:14,531
Now say good night.

818
00:54:27,354 --> 00:54:28,343
Fucker.

819
00:54:34,494 --> 00:54:37,986
Drop your weapon!
Put your weapon on the ground!

820
00:54:38,031 --> 00:54:39,999
Put your hands up!

821
00:54:40,033 --> 00:54:43,525
l said get your hands up!
Now turn around!

822
00:54:52,646 --> 00:54:55,171
Put your hands behind your head!

823
00:54:58,885 --> 00:55:00,910
Get down on your knees
right now!

824
00:55:58,612 --> 00:56:02,480
lt's all right.

825
00:56:04,417 --> 00:56:05,543
Let's go.

826
00:56:07,521 --> 00:56:10,354
-Come on.
-No.

827
00:56:17,797 --> 00:56:19,389
She ain't gonna open the door?

828
00:56:19,432 --> 00:56:22,026
Someone right fucking there
looking at us. Hello?

829
00:56:22,068 --> 00:56:23,695
Danny, it's for you.

830
00:56:24,704 --> 00:56:26,535
Be right there.

831
00:56:39,719 --> 00:56:42,711
Open the door, Danny.
lt's fucking freezing!

832
00:56:42,756 --> 00:56:44,747
Danny, l'm gonna be sick!

833
00:56:44,791 --> 00:56:47,783
Come on, Danny!

834
00:57:18,391 --> 00:57:19,756
l'm gonna go get some beers.

835
00:57:32,872 --> 00:57:34,999
Hey, what a party, fatso?

836
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:38,841
l'm not fat, asshole!
l'm husky!

837
00:57:38,878 --> 00:57:40,903
What the fuck's up, Seth?

838
00:57:40,947 --> 00:57:43,211
Drink up, Danny,
before your brother sees you.

839
00:57:43,249 --> 00:57:44,443
Holy fuck, he's here!

840
00:57:44,484 --> 00:57:47,749
Yeah, he's fucking here.
Go pay your respects.

841
00:57:47,787 --> 00:57:48,776
Fuck you, Seth!

842
00:57:51,157 --> 00:57:53,853
Let's go talk to Cameron, Danny.

843
00:57:53,893 --> 00:57:55,690
-Father Vinyard?
-How's it going?

844
00:57:55,729 --> 00:57:58,527
l'm Jason, this is Chris.
We're friends with your brother.

845
00:57:58,565 --> 00:58:01,295
You are a fucking god, man!

846
00:58:19,452 --> 00:58:21,352
l thought you turned
that paper in.

847
00:58:21,388 --> 00:58:24,186
l did. Now fucking Murray
turned me in...

848
00:58:24,224 --> 00:58:27,455
so Sweeney's making me
write another one.

849
00:58:29,029 --> 00:58:32,328
Good old Sweeney.
He never stops trying.

850
00:58:32,365 --> 00:58:35,334
He's one of those
"proud to be nigger" people.

851
00:58:35,368 --> 00:58:36,767
l hate those guys.

852
00:58:36,803 --> 00:58:40,000
Wait a minute, Danny.
He's not proud.

853
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:45,501
No. He's a manipulative,
self-righteous Uncle Tom.

854
00:58:45,545 --> 00:58:48,742
He's making you feel guilty
about writing on Adolf Hitler.

855
00:58:48,782 --> 00:58:53,947
Some nigger, some spic writes
about Martin Luther King...

856
00:58:53,987 --> 00:58:58,481
or fucking Cesar commie Chavez
gets a pat on the head.

857
00:58:58,525 --> 00:59:00,584
Yeah.

858
00:59:00,627 --> 00:59:04,495
You can see the hypocrisy
in that, can't you?

859
00:59:04,531 --> 00:59:05,520
Definitely.

860
00:59:09,969 --> 00:59:11,527
Come on, let's go.

861
00:59:11,571 --> 00:59:14,404
No. Listen. Wait.

862
00:59:14,441 --> 00:59:16,409
l want to see you, OK?

863
00:59:16,443 --> 00:59:19,469
l do, but l gotta
take care of something tonight.

864
00:59:21,381 --> 00:59:24,009
-OK.
-You understand?

865
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:27,383
Yeah. l'm here.
When you're ready, l'm here.

866
00:59:31,157 --> 00:59:33,751
-Would you do something with me?
-Anything.

867
00:59:33,793 --> 00:59:35,784
Leave with me.

868
00:59:35,829 --> 00:59:38,354
Leave where?

869
00:59:38,398 --> 00:59:42,300
Leave here. Leave all this.
Just come with me.

870
00:59:42,335 --> 00:59:44,303
Why would you want to leave?

871
00:59:44,337 --> 00:59:45,998
They worship you.
You're like a god to them.

872
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:49,497
lf we had it good before, wait
till you see what it's like now.

873
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:53,137
l don't want all that.
l don't want my family involved.

874
00:59:53,179 --> 00:59:55,739
Everything l've done here
fucked it all up, understand?

875
00:59:55,782 --> 00:59:57,807
You think what you did
was wrong?

876
00:59:57,851 --> 01:00:00,718
Oh, baby. Oh, come on.

877
01:00:00,754 --> 01:00:03,279
Those niggers got exactly
what they deserved...

878
01:00:03,323 --> 01:00:05,689
and we all know that.

879
01:00:05,725 --> 01:00:08,819
l understand you just got out,
but no one's gonna hurt you.

880
01:00:08,862 --> 01:00:11,330
No one can touch you.
There's a small army out there.

881
01:00:11,364 --> 01:00:13,958
We're not gonna let
a bunch of spooks kick us out.

882
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,298
You're not listening to me.
l'm not scared.

883
01:00:16,336 --> 01:00:18,566
l don't want it anymore.

884
01:00:18,605 --> 01:00:22,234
l'm done with it.
l'm through with this.

885
01:00:22,275 --> 01:00:27,144
lt's bullshit, Stacey.

886
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:30,274
You don't need this, Stacey.
Come on, trust me.

887
01:00:30,316 --> 01:00:34,082
lf you want to be with me,
just trust me. Come with me.

888
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,382
Come on.

889
01:00:35,421 --> 01:00:38,857
You're nuts. You are nuts.
No way.

890
01:00:38,892 --> 01:00:41,952
l don't think you realize
what's been going on here.

891
01:00:41,995 --> 01:00:45,795
We are 10 times what we were,
and we are bloody organized.

892
01:00:45,832 --> 01:00:48,392
lt is like nothing
you have ever seen.

893
01:00:48,434 --> 01:00:50,265
This was a mistake. Forget it.

894
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,703
Wait a second.
What was a mistake?

895
01:00:52,739 --> 01:00:54,969
Stacey, just say good-bye.

896
01:00:55,008 --> 01:00:57,943
This isn't you. l know you.

897
01:00:57,977 --> 01:00:59,877
You don't know anything
about me, Stacey.

898
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:10,088
-Are you Danny's brother?
-Yeah.

899
01:01:10,123 --> 01:01:13,149
Will you tell him
Lizzy's looking for him?

900
01:01:13,193 --> 01:01:15,161
Thank you.

901
01:01:16,896 --> 01:01:20,730
We'll let the niggers, kikes,
and spics grab for the pie.

902
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,962
Can't blame 'em.

903
01:01:23,002 --> 01:01:25,493
Course, they're gonna
have to fight to get it.

904
01:01:27,307 --> 01:01:30,105
And if we scare
the fuck out of people...

905
01:01:30,143 --> 01:01:34,136
and a few people get killed
in the process, so be it.

906
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:36,842
Gonna put that
in your paper, Danny?

907
01:01:36,883 --> 01:01:39,579
Hey, man.

908
01:01:39,619 --> 01:01:43,988
Well, look who's here.
The return of the soldier.

909
01:01:44,023 --> 01:01:46,014
What are you doing here, Danny?

910
01:01:46,059 --> 01:01:49,153
Come on, man.
l had to check it out.

911
01:01:49,195 --> 01:01:50,457
You knew l was gonna come.

912
01:01:50,496 --> 01:01:54,432
Let the kid alone, Derek.
He knows when to go to bed.

913
01:01:56,436 --> 01:01:57,630
Go wait outside.

914
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:59,934
Come on, Der.
l'm not doing anything.

915
01:01:59,973 --> 01:02:03,431
This little blonde girl
keeps asking for you.

916
01:02:03,476 --> 01:02:05,239
She's dying. Come on.

917
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:07,712
-l gotta check out.
-Go easy on her.

918
01:02:07,747 --> 01:02:09,738
All right.

919
01:02:13,586 --> 01:02:15,213
Wait for me right outside.

920
01:02:20,059 --> 01:02:22,220
Take it easy.

921
01:02:22,262 --> 01:02:24,696
Chill out.

922
01:02:24,731 --> 01:02:27,131
You're on safe ground.

923
01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:29,896
You don't have to watch
your ass around here.

924
01:02:31,337 --> 01:02:33,328
Come on. Sit down. Relax.

925
01:02:35,341 --> 01:02:38,174
l'm sorry.
The party was a little quick...

926
01:02:38,211 --> 01:02:41,442
but we're just so damn glad
you're back, Derek.

927
01:02:41,481 --> 01:02:43,540
lt's only natural
you should feel a little funny.

928
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:45,050
l don't feel funny, Cam.

929
01:02:45,084 --> 01:02:47,848
You made the fat kid
a little nervous.

930
01:02:47,887 --> 01:02:49,855
He thinks the joint
messed with your mind.

931
01:02:49,889 --> 01:02:51,356
lt did.

932
01:02:58,464 --> 01:03:02,560
Glory, glory, hallelujah...

933
01:03:02,602 --> 01:03:07,266
Glory, glory, hallelujah...

934
01:03:07,307 --> 01:03:10,640
The white man marches on!

935
01:03:10,677 --> 01:03:13,840
Things have changed
since you've been gone.

936
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,075
You talk about organization?

937
01:03:16,115 --> 01:03:19,016
Wait'll you see what
we've done with the internet.

938
01:03:19,052 --> 01:03:21,020
We've got every gang
from Seattle to San Diego...

939
01:03:21,054 --> 01:03:22,646
working together now.

940
01:03:22,689 --> 01:03:25,180
Not competing anymore.
They're consolidated.

941
01:03:25,224 --> 01:03:27,624
Only thing we lack is
a little overall leadership.

942
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:30,823
That's where you come in.

943
01:03:30,863 --> 01:03:33,923
Those people out there got
a lot of respect for you.

944
01:03:33,967 --> 01:03:36,197
When you're ready,
come talk to me about it.

945
01:03:36,235 --> 01:03:40,001
You can forget about that.
l'm done with it, Cam.

946
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:43,668
Yeah, well,
l know you grew out of...

947
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:47,237
that shaved head bullshit
a long time ago, thank God.

948
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,009
l like your hair
the way it is now.

949
01:03:49,048 --> 01:03:52,074
See, that's what l mean.
We're thinking bigger now.

950
01:03:52,118 --> 01:03:53,847
No more of this fucking
grocery store--

951
01:03:53,886 --> 01:03:55,786
You're not listening to me.
l am done with it.

952
01:03:55,822 --> 01:03:58,052
All that bullshit out there
and all your bullshit, too.

953
01:03:58,091 --> 01:03:59,786
l'm out.

954
01:03:59,826 --> 01:04:02,954
l understand how you feel.
You've just done hard time.

955
01:04:02,996 --> 01:04:05,123
Don't you fucking talk to me
about hard time.

956
01:04:05,164 --> 01:04:07,325
-You don't know anything.
-l've done mine.

957
01:04:07,367 --> 01:04:09,767
You didn't do shit.
l found out about you.

958
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:11,770
You did two months,
then rolled over on two kids...

959
01:04:11,804 --> 01:04:13,738
and let them go down for you.

960
01:04:13,773 --> 01:04:15,764
So don't feed me
your fucking lies, Cameron.

961
01:04:17,543 --> 01:04:20,979
All right. This is stupid.
l'm done.

962
01:04:21,014 --> 01:04:23,676
You go cool off.
Get laid. Do something.

963
01:04:23,716 --> 01:04:26,549
Get your head on straight,
and then l'll talk to you.

964
01:04:26,586 --> 01:04:28,679
But it doesn't matter
if l don't, does it?

965
01:04:28,721 --> 01:04:30,689
'Cause you got the next crop...

966
01:04:30,723 --> 01:04:32,520
lined up and ready to go,
you fucking chicken hawk.

967
01:04:32,558 --> 01:04:34,423
Excuse me?

968
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:37,088
You prey on people, Cam !
You use them !

969
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:40,224
l lost three years of my life
for your fucking phony cause...

970
01:04:40,266 --> 01:04:42,029
but l am on to you now,
you fucking snake.

971
01:04:42,068 --> 01:04:46,164
Derek, watch it. Be careful.
Remember where you are.

972
01:04:46,205 --> 01:04:49,868
This isn't some fucking country
club you can waltz in and out--

973
01:04:49,909 --> 01:04:51,706
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

974
01:04:51,744 --> 01:04:54,645
l came here to tell you
one thing. l am out.

975
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,580
Out! And Danny is out, too!

976
01:04:56,616 --> 01:04:58,880
lf you come near my family,
l'll fucking kill you.

977
01:04:58,918 --> 01:05:01,386
Excuse me, but fuck you, Derek.

978
01:05:01,421 --> 01:05:03,719
You can't come
barking threats at me.

979
01:05:03,756 --> 01:05:06,623
You can do whatever you want,
but Danny is a good kid.

980
01:05:06,659 --> 01:05:09,025
He's not some whiny pussy
like you.

981
01:05:09,062 --> 01:05:10,996
He needs my help,
and l'm gonna give it to him.

982
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:13,498
lf you come near Danny again...

983
01:05:13,533 --> 01:05:15,728
l will feed you
your fucking heart, Cameron.

984
01:05:15,768 --> 01:05:21,604
l won't have to.
He'll come to me.

985
01:05:21,641 --> 01:05:23,836
l'm more important to him now
than you'll ever be.

986
01:05:28,247 --> 01:05:29,305
Shit.

987
01:05:29,348 --> 01:05:32,340
You're a fucking dead man,
Vinyard.

988
01:05:47,834 --> 01:05:51,167
Hey, where's Cameron?
Where the fuck is he?

989
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,001
Stay away from me, Stacey.
Danny!

990
01:05:56,042 --> 01:05:58,010
Why don't you share
with the rest of us...

991
01:05:58,044 --> 01:06:01,605
what you just said to me,
you piece of shit nigger!

992
01:06:01,647 --> 01:06:03,842
You monkey-fucking traitor!

993
01:06:03,883 --> 01:06:05,646
You a fucking nigger-fucker?

994
01:06:05,685 --> 01:06:07,653
Hey, Danny! Come on!

995
01:06:07,687 --> 01:06:10,178
He's a fucking nigger!
Nigger! Nigger!

996
01:06:10,223 --> 01:06:13,158
Cam's out cold!
Where the fuck are you going?

997
01:06:13,192 --> 01:06:15,183
Gun! He's got a gun!

998
01:06:15,228 --> 01:06:17,560
Shit! Back up!

999
01:06:19,132 --> 01:06:21,032
You make me fucking sick!

1000
01:06:21,067 --> 01:06:23,934
Put down the fucking gun!

1001
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:25,164
Shoot the nigger!

1002
01:06:25,204 --> 01:06:29,038
Shoot him !
Do it, Seth! Shoot him !

1003
01:06:29,075 --> 01:06:31,305
Traitor!

1004
01:06:31,344 --> 01:06:32,709
Do it, Seth! Do it!

1005
01:06:35,882 --> 01:06:37,679
Back up! Move!

1006
01:06:39,685 --> 01:06:42,051
Back up! Back the fuck up!

1007
01:06:42,088 --> 01:06:44,522
Move! Move!

1008
01:06:44,557 --> 01:06:45,854
Easy, Derek! Hey!

1009
01:07:07,547 --> 01:07:08,514
Easy, Danny!

1010
01:07:08,548 --> 01:07:10,607
Who do you think you are?

1011
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:13,642
-Danny, relax.
-Who do you think you are?

1012
01:07:13,686 --> 01:07:15,984
Take it easy, Dan.

1013
01:07:16,022 --> 01:07:18,081
l fucking hate you, Der!

1014
01:07:18,124 --> 01:07:20,149
All right. l mean it.

1015
01:07:20,193 --> 01:07:21,660
Huh?

1016
01:07:21,694 --> 01:07:24,254
Come on. Shut up.
Take it easy.

1017
01:07:24,297 --> 01:07:26,265
What's happened to you, Der?

1018
01:07:26,299 --> 01:07:28,699
Take it easy.

1019
01:07:28,734 --> 01:07:31,066
What's happened to you, Der?

1020
01:07:39,178 --> 01:07:41,840
Come on. Come on.

1021
01:07:44,984 --> 01:07:47,145
lt's just so fucked.

1022
01:07:47,186 --> 01:07:50,155
l'm sorry. You weren't
supposed to see that.

1023
01:07:50,189 --> 01:07:51,417
l told you not to come.

1024
01:07:51,457 --> 01:07:54,085
Fuck you, man.

1025
01:07:54,126 --> 01:07:55,684
That was so fucked up.

1026
01:07:55,728 --> 01:07:58,322
l know, l know.

1027
01:07:58,364 --> 01:08:00,958
God, it wasn't supposed
to happen that way.

1028
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,333
That was fucked up.
That's all there is to it.

1029
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:08,136
That's not what l planned.
lt just all went to shit.

1030
01:08:08,174 --> 01:08:11,803
Just shit.
Got totally out of control.

1031
01:08:13,379 --> 01:08:16,177
What's fucking happening here?

1032
01:08:20,753 --> 01:08:22,118
Hey, look at me.

1033
01:08:26,459 --> 01:08:27,949
l can't go back to that, Dan.

1034
01:08:27,994 --> 01:08:30,292
Can't go back to what?

1035
01:08:30,329 --> 01:08:32,422
To any of it.

1036
01:08:32,465 --> 01:08:35,025
Those guys, the gang, that life.
l'm done with it.

1037
01:08:39,238 --> 01:08:40,671
What happened to you up there?

1038
01:08:48,547 --> 01:08:50,640
Feed line. Back up for chow.

1039
01:08:50,683 --> 01:08:52,583
Don't be late,
you piece of shit!

1040
01:08:52,618 --> 01:08:56,611
Let's go if you want to eat!
Get up! Five minutes!

1041
01:08:56,656 --> 01:08:58,954
This is my fucking house!
Get up!

1042
01:08:58,991 --> 01:09:01,357
What the fuck's your problem,
you assholes?

1043
01:09:01,394 --> 01:09:04,591
Move! Let's go!
Open the fucking gates!

1044
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:06,996
All right, rack 'em !

1045
01:09:11,671 --> 01:09:13,764
Five minutes! Step forward!

1046
01:09:13,806 --> 01:09:16,172
Those beds better be made.

1047
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:21,703
After two days, l didn't think
l'd make it a week.

1048
01:09:21,747 --> 01:09:23,840
Come on, you motherfuckers!

1049
01:09:23,883 --> 01:09:26,215
You want to eat today,
you fucking piece of shit?

1050
01:09:26,252 --> 01:09:28,220
Hey, you white trash
piece of shit!

1051
01:09:28,254 --> 01:09:30,188
You think you're
fucking special, whitefish?

1052
01:09:30,222 --> 01:09:33,385
Button that top button!
Let's go! Move!

1053
01:09:33,426 --> 01:09:36,657
Are you eyeballing me?
Don't eyeball-fuck me, asshole!

1054
01:09:36,696 --> 01:09:39,256
l'll fucking kill you!

1055
01:09:39,298 --> 01:09:42,267
l'm gonna keep my eye on you,
you white piece of shit!

1056
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:47,062
Don't fucking eyeball me, boy!
l'll fucking skull-fuck you!

1057
01:09:47,106 --> 01:09:49,074
Step forward!

1058
01:09:50,409 --> 01:09:51,398
Turn to the left.

1059
01:09:53,446 --> 01:09:56,938
Step forward to chow! Let's go!

1060
01:09:56,982 --> 01:09:59,450
Come on!
Hey, fish, straight ahead.

1061
01:09:59,485 --> 01:10:01,817
Straight ahead, fucker!
Let's go!

1062
01:10:01,854 --> 01:10:04,982
All the wrong people
knew who l was anyway...

1063
01:10:05,024 --> 01:10:08,152
so l figured l'd put up a flag
and hope a friend sees it.

1064
01:11:10,623 --> 01:11:13,558
That's the cat l'm talking
about right there.

1065
01:11:32,745 --> 01:11:34,736
Boss.

1066
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:36,372
Have a seat.

1067
01:11:37,383 --> 01:11:38,543
lt's a pleasure.

1068
01:11:48,527 --> 01:11:50,995
Don't fuck with me, all right?

1069
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:53,362
'Cause l'm the most dangerous
man in this prison.

1070
01:11:53,399 --> 01:11:57,358
You know why?
'Cause l control the underwear.

1071
01:12:05,177 --> 01:12:08,146
We pick 'em up over here,
and we store 'em over there.

1072
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:10,148
And l hope you work out,
all right?

1073
01:12:10,182 --> 01:12:13,208
'Cause the last guy they sent me
didn't wear no drawers...

1074
01:12:13,252 --> 01:12:15,379
couldn't read
the sizes in the drawers...

1075
01:12:15,421 --> 01:12:17,616
and used to sniff
the drawers, all right?

1076
01:12:17,656 --> 01:12:20,056
We got two sizes--medium
and large, all right?

1077
01:12:20,092 --> 01:12:22,560
All you gotta do is put
the mediums with the mediums...

1078
01:12:22,595 --> 01:12:24,222
and the larges with
the larges, all right?

1079
01:12:24,263 --> 01:12:26,231
l know it's a boring job...

1080
01:12:26,265 --> 01:12:28,460
but it's better than that
last shit they had me doing.

1081
01:12:28,501 --> 01:12:32,403
l spent two years in the kitchen
scrubbing hot-ass pots and pans.

1082
01:12:32,438 --> 01:12:35,339
That you don't wanna do,
all right?

1083
01:12:35,374 --> 01:12:37,365
You should be happy as shit
you landed this job.

1084
01:12:37,409 --> 01:12:40,276
There's no telling what they'd
have you do up in the joint.

1085
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:45,307
By the way...

1086
01:12:45,351 --> 01:12:46,978
what you in for?

1087
01:12:50,022 --> 01:12:51,649
Probably robbed
some old lady, huh?

1088
01:13:03,435 --> 01:13:05,733
OK, l know your kind, right?

1089
01:13:05,771 --> 01:13:08,137
Bad-ass peckerwood
with an attitude.

1090
01:13:09,742 --> 01:13:13,906
Let me tell you something, man,
you better watch your ass...

1091
01:13:13,946 --> 01:13:17,814
'cause in the joint,
you the nigger, not me.

1092
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:25,383
l was a year in.
l thought l was cruising.

1093
01:13:25,424 --> 01:13:28,154
Then everything started
getting complicated.

1094
01:13:55,154 --> 01:13:56,781
What the fuck is that?

1095
01:13:58,257 --> 01:13:59,485
What's that all about?

1096
01:13:59,525 --> 01:14:03,222
That's just politics, man.
Favors, you know?

1097
01:14:04,797 --> 01:14:07,732
He's doing favors
for that fucking spic?

1098
01:14:08,801 --> 01:14:11,269
Mitch has just got
a little something extra...

1099
01:14:11,303 --> 01:14:13,635
on the side
with them boys, you know?

1100
01:14:13,672 --> 01:14:15,902
You're kidding, right?

1101
01:14:15,941 --> 01:14:18,068
No.

1102
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:20,044
That's bullshit, man.

1103
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:21,740
Somebody should say something
to him.

1104
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:23,407
What the fuck is he thinking?

1105
01:14:23,449 --> 01:14:26,316
Mitch is the only reason
you're not a corpse right now.

1106
01:14:26,352 --> 01:14:28,786
You know what?
l don't fucking give a shit.

1107
01:14:28,821 --> 01:14:31,016
l can take care of myself.

1108
01:14:31,056 --> 01:14:34,992
He shouldn't be doing that.
l'm getting sick of it, man.

1109
01:14:35,027 --> 01:14:37,757
There's a lot of hard talk here
and no follow-through.

1110
01:14:40,466 --> 01:14:44,334
l think you better chill out
on the preaching bullshit.

1111
01:14:44,370 --> 01:14:46,804
We're getting a little tired
of that shit around here.

1112
01:14:46,839 --> 01:14:50,366
Ease up on it.

1113
01:15:20,339 --> 01:15:21,670
What are you doing here, Doris?

1114
01:15:21,707 --> 01:15:23,868
l was in the neighborhood.

1115
01:15:23,909 --> 01:15:26,673
Look, l told you l don't want
you all coming up here.

1116
01:15:26,712 --> 01:15:29,875
l don't care
what you told me, OK?

1117
01:15:29,915 --> 01:15:31,212
l need to talk to you now.

1118
01:15:51,804 --> 01:15:53,328
So, how is everyone?

1119
01:15:53,372 --> 01:15:57,809
Davina's great. She's getting
straight As almost.

1120
01:15:57,843 --> 01:16:03,304
And Ally's walking,
starting to talk a little.

1121
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,446
How's Danny?

1122
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:18,058
He holds you up so high.

1123
01:16:18,097 --> 01:16:21,396
He thinks you're the greatest.

1124
01:16:21,433 --> 01:16:24,561
He's always bragging
about you to Cameron...

1125
01:16:24,603 --> 01:16:26,537
and all his new friends.

1126
01:16:30,109 --> 01:16:31,906
He's starting
to remind me of you.

1127
01:16:31,944 --> 01:16:34,913
Jesus, don't sound
so worried, all right?

1128
01:16:34,947 --> 01:16:38,974
l'm sure he's fine.
He's 16 years old, Doris.

1129
01:16:39,017 --> 01:16:40,780
He's not gonna be
a little angel forever.

1130
01:16:40,819 --> 01:16:43,287
You think because
l watched my firstborn...

1131
01:16:43,322 --> 01:16:45,950
fuck up his entire life
that l can sit here...

1132
01:16:45,991 --> 01:16:49,427
and see my baby follow
him down the same toilet?

1133
01:16:49,461 --> 01:16:51,156
l can't fix all this shit
from up here.

1134
01:16:51,196 --> 01:16:53,130
l'm not asking you to.

1135
01:16:53,165 --> 01:16:56,498
All it does is make me feel bad.
You're just making it harder.

1136
01:16:56,535 --> 01:17:00,096
You think you're the only one
doing time, Derek?

1137
01:17:00,139 --> 01:17:02,369
You think
you're here all alone?

1138
01:17:02,407 --> 01:17:04,238
You think l'm not in here
with you?

1139
01:17:16,855 --> 01:17:18,322
Fuck, man.

1140
01:17:21,193 --> 01:17:23,491
Every day l watch you
go through these sheets...

1141
01:17:23,529 --> 01:17:25,360
like you gonna get
to the end of them.

1142
01:17:26,698 --> 01:17:28,825
Look, nigger,
will you chill the fuck out?

1143
01:17:28,867 --> 01:17:30,164
Goddamn!

1144
01:17:30,202 --> 01:17:32,363
No matter how fast
you get through them...

1145
01:17:32,404 --> 01:17:34,964
they gonna keep bringing them in
and bringing them in.

1146
01:17:35,007 --> 01:17:36,736
Throwing them around
like that...

1147
01:17:36,775 --> 01:17:38,868
ain't gonna do a damn thing
but give you a heart attack!

1148
01:17:38,911 --> 01:17:40,674
And you know what?
That's cool with me!

1149
01:17:40,712 --> 01:17:43,146
But you gonna give me
a goddamn heart attack, too!

1150
01:17:51,723 --> 01:17:53,782
l know, l'm just a dumb,
stupid nigger, right?

1151
01:17:53,826 --> 01:17:55,521
What do l know?

1152
01:17:57,563 --> 01:18:01,124
l know l ain't the one getting
mad at them sheets, though.

1153
01:18:01,166 --> 01:18:04,158
As a matter of fact,
the only sheets l get mad at...

1154
01:18:04,203 --> 01:18:06,171
l'll tell you.

1155
01:18:07,673 --> 01:18:10,233
All right, boy,
this is what we gonna do.

1156
01:18:10,275 --> 01:18:12,140
We gonna hate some niggers.
That's what we'll do today.

1157
01:18:12,177 --> 01:18:13,940
We gonna hate
some goddamn niggers.

1158
01:18:13,979 --> 01:18:15,469
That's all we gonna do is
hate some niggers all day.

1159
01:18:15,514 --> 01:18:18,677
Don't know what a nigger is,
but we gonna hate them.

1160
01:18:18,717 --> 01:18:20,651
My cousin Derek
is in the pen right now...

1161
01:18:20,686 --> 01:18:25,020
workin' next to a nigger,
driving him nigger crazy.

1162
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:45,540
See? That's the ticket.

1163
01:18:46,545 --> 01:18:47,842
Nice and easy.

1164
01:18:49,381 --> 01:18:51,144
Now we can ignore
each other in peace.

1165
01:18:54,953 --> 01:18:57,683
"What are you doing?"
You know what he tells me?

1166
01:18:57,723 --> 01:19:00,487
"lt's better than the pig
l just tried to fuck."

1167
01:19:03,395 --> 01:19:05,761
He never lets me
finish the joke.

1168
01:19:05,797 --> 01:19:07,287
You fuck him, too?

1169
01:19:09,301 --> 01:19:12,293
Whatever. She's laying on
her back, her legs are open...

1170
01:19:14,506 --> 01:19:18,499
What's up? How you doing?
There you go.

1171
01:19:29,588 --> 01:19:32,421
He was taking it
from the Mexicans...

1172
01:19:32,457 --> 01:19:34,550
and dealing it out
to his own people.

1173
01:19:34,593 --> 01:19:37,619
He didn't believe in shit.
None of them did.

1174
01:20:03,322 --> 01:20:06,519
What? Come on, man.

1175
01:20:06,558 --> 01:20:10,790
Don't look at me like that.
You know what that smells like.

1176
01:20:10,829 --> 01:20:13,195
Don't tell me this smell
don't remind you of a woman.

1177
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,965
God, l miss that smell, man.

1178
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:21,528
The job l had on the outside
wasn't much better than this...

1179
01:20:21,573 --> 01:20:23,700
but at least l got
to go home every night...

1180
01:20:23,742 --> 01:20:26,233
and lie down next to
that sweet smell, man.

1181
01:20:28,246 --> 01:20:31,738
God, l miss that.
You got a woman?

1182
01:20:32,884 --> 01:20:34,715
Yeah, you got a woman, man.

1183
01:20:34,753 --> 01:20:37,347
Let me give you some advice,
all right?

1184
01:20:37,389 --> 01:20:40,222
When she comes to visit you...

1185
01:20:40,258 --> 01:20:42,226
whatever you do,
no matter what...

1186
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:44,228
don't let her leave here
in a fight, man.

1187
01:20:44,262 --> 01:20:46,230
Don't let her walk out
with a bad attitude...

1188
01:20:46,264 --> 01:20:48,892
'cause if you do,
you spend the next week...

1189
01:20:48,934 --> 01:20:51,732
wondering if she's getting her
fuck on with somebody else...

1190
01:20:51,770 --> 01:20:53,237
you know what l'm saying?

1191
01:20:53,271 --> 01:20:55,739
So when she come to see you,
it's nothing but sweet talk.

1192
01:20:55,774 --> 01:20:58,470
Send her away floating,
all right?

1193
01:20:58,510 --> 01:21:01,775
'Cause it's not like the real
world where you can fight...

1194
01:21:01,813 --> 01:21:04,941
'cause you can make up
and have that make-up sex.

1195
01:21:04,983 --> 01:21:06,848
Know what l'm saying?
That angry sex.

1196
01:21:06,885 --> 01:21:08,614
That sex with an attitude.

1197
01:21:08,653 --> 01:21:11,986
You lay on your back and let her
take out that aggression on you.

1198
01:21:12,024 --> 01:21:13,651
All guys know that, man.
That's that good sex.

1199
01:21:13,692 --> 01:21:16,525
That's that pow, pow, pow.

1200
01:21:16,561 --> 01:21:19,530
Let her get on top,
and she'll punish you first.

1201
01:21:19,564 --> 01:21:21,191
"You been a bad boy, huh?

1202
01:21:21,233 --> 01:21:24,066
"You been a bad boy,
and l'm gonna punish you.

1203
01:21:24,102 --> 01:21:25,694
"l'm gonna put it on you.

1204
01:21:25,737 --> 01:21:29,195
"Don't you ever...
let...me...catch...you...

1205
01:21:29,241 --> 01:21:32,540
"looking at...another...woman.
Yeah, yeah.

1206
01:21:32,577 --> 01:21:34,204
"l may forgive you
if you bring it.

1207
01:21:34,246 --> 01:21:36,714
"l think l can. l--l forgive.

1208
01:21:36,748 --> 01:21:39,842
"l forgive. Right there.
You're hitting it.

1209
01:21:39,885 --> 01:21:41,819
"My spot. That's it. Right.

1210
01:21:41,853 --> 01:21:45,687
"Yes. l for--l forgive you.
l forgive you.

1211
01:21:45,724 --> 01:21:48,352
"l for--l for--
l for--l forgive you!

1212
01:21:48,393 --> 01:21:50,554
"l love you!"

1213
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,173
How do you figure the Lakers
to ever be a bigger dynasty...

1214
01:22:10,215 --> 01:22:12,012
than the Celtics?

1215
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:14,518
The Lakers
are a flare-up, a fluke.

1216
01:22:14,553 --> 01:22:15,747
Are you crazy?

1217
01:22:15,787 --> 01:22:17,846
One good coach for four years.
The Celtics are a dynasty!

1218
01:22:17,889 --> 01:22:20,517
Come on, man.
The Celtics, right?

1219
01:22:20,559 --> 01:22:22,754
The ugliest team in
the history of sports.

1220
01:22:22,794 --> 01:22:24,921
A dynasty of
ugly motherfuckers, man.

1221
01:22:24,963 --> 01:22:27,158
Look at Kevin McHale.

1222
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:29,963
James Worthy. That guy
has a head like a melon.

1223
01:22:30,001 --> 01:22:31,332
He had ladies.

1224
01:22:31,369 --> 01:22:34,065
l can't even talk to you.
l don't know what you're saying.

1225
01:22:34,106 --> 01:22:37,007
You are tweaking.
Boston Celtics.

1226
01:22:37,042 --> 01:22:39,203
-How many is that?
-That's enough.

1227
01:22:39,244 --> 01:22:40,404
Enough? All right.

1228
01:22:44,249 --> 01:22:45,580
You got that?

1229
01:22:50,255 --> 01:22:53,224
-l lost count, man.
-Doesn't matter, man.

1230
01:22:53,258 --> 01:22:55,749
Who's counting anyway?

1231
01:23:03,034 --> 01:23:05,195
All right,
so l wanna know something.

1232
01:23:06,204 --> 01:23:08,229
What the fuck
landed you in here?

1233
01:23:08,273 --> 01:23:10,468
You didn't kill anybody,
too skinny for a gangbanger.

1234
01:23:10,509 --> 01:23:13,171
Ain't that a bitch?
Don't judge a book by its cover.

1235
01:23:13,211 --> 01:23:14,644
l can throw these things.

1236
01:23:14,679 --> 01:23:17,546
Whatever. Come on.
What did you do?

1237
01:23:17,582 --> 01:23:20,176
None of your business.
lt's embarrassing.

1238
01:23:20,218 --> 01:23:22,049
lt's none of
your goddamn business.

1239
01:23:23,221 --> 01:23:26,190
Come on. Everybody in here
is embarrassed.

1240
01:23:26,224 --> 01:23:28,715
Nobody in here
got away with anything.

1241
01:23:29,728 --> 01:23:31,218
What'd you do?

1242
01:23:33,064 --> 01:23:35,692
Look, man, l stole a TV,
all right?

1243
01:23:35,734 --> 01:23:38,396
So you stole a TV.
What's embarrassing about that?

1244
01:23:38,436 --> 01:23:42,202
l stole a TV from a store
next to a doughnut shop.

1245
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:45,209
l ran out, the owner's
right behind me yelling.

1246
01:23:45,243 --> 01:23:47,143
Bam ! l run into three cops.

1247
01:23:47,179 --> 01:23:50,637
l told you it was embarrassing.
You're laughing.

1248
01:23:50,682 --> 01:23:53,207
Wait a sec, wait a sec.

1249
01:23:53,251 --> 01:23:55,116
That don't make sense.

1250
01:23:56,354 --> 01:24:00,188
Nah, you didn't get six years
for stealing a TV. Come on.

1251
01:24:00,225 --> 01:24:03,661
l come out, the police officer
grabs my arm...

1252
01:24:03,695 --> 01:24:05,629
the TV falls on his foot
and breaks it.

1253
01:24:05,664 --> 01:24:10,465
They said l threw the TV at him.
Assault. Six years.

1254
01:24:10,502 --> 01:24:14,598
Come on. Tell the truth.
You chucked it at him.

1255
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:17,608
Like l said,
l came out of the store...

1256
01:24:17,642 --> 01:24:21,271
he grabbed my arm,
it fell on his foot.

1257
01:24:26,084 --> 01:24:27,346
Come on now.

1258
01:24:27,385 --> 01:24:30,149
What you got for me, huh?

1259
01:24:31,156 --> 01:24:32,521
There you go, baby!

1260
01:24:32,557 --> 01:24:34,923
Yeah!
That's what l'm talking about.

1261
01:25:13,465 --> 01:25:14,727
Fuck you!

1262
01:25:14,766 --> 01:25:16,631
Give me a towel. Hold him.

1263
01:25:23,908 --> 01:25:25,739
You wanna be a nigger,
sweet boy?

1264
01:25:25,777 --> 01:25:28,337
-Fuck you!
-We gonna treat you like one.

1265
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:31,508
-No.
-Come on.

1266
01:25:33,518 --> 01:25:35,213
Come on, give it to him !

1267
01:25:46,431 --> 01:25:47,955
Fuck you!

1268
01:25:51,936 --> 01:25:54,404
That was real sweet.

1269
01:25:54,439 --> 01:25:55,599
Fuck you!

1270
01:26:28,173 --> 01:26:29,197
How is he?

1271
01:26:30,375 --> 01:26:32,707
Well, he took six stitches.

1272
01:27:14,185 --> 01:27:17,154
Man, what the hell are you
doing here, anyway?

1273
01:27:17,188 --> 01:27:20,282
l came to talk about Danny, but
we don't have to do that now.

1274
01:27:20,325 --> 01:27:22,350
l brought you some books.

1275
01:27:24,696 --> 01:27:27,995
What about him, you know?
Don't keep me in suspense.

1276
01:27:28,032 --> 01:27:30,023
He's headed right where you are.

1277
01:27:31,035 --> 01:27:34,664
You know what? My mother
already laid this trip on me.

1278
01:27:34,706 --> 01:27:37,402
Danny's not my responsibility.

1279
01:27:37,442 --> 01:27:39,171
What do you expect me
to do with that?

1280
01:27:39,210 --> 01:27:42,008
lt doesn't help me.
Am l supposed to feel guilty?

1281
01:27:42,046 --> 01:27:43,445
l don't want you to do anything.

1282
01:27:44,048 --> 01:27:46,175
l need to know the truth
about how you feel.

1283
01:27:46,217 --> 01:27:48,185
You think l want him in here?

1284
01:27:48,219 --> 01:27:50,687
l mean...l don't know.

1285
01:27:50,722 --> 01:27:52,155
l don't know what l feel.
l'm all...

1286
01:27:54,426 --> 01:27:56,519
l feel a little inside out.

1287
01:27:56,561 --> 01:27:58,529
l'm, you know--l don't know.

1288
01:27:58,563 --> 01:28:02,465
There's some things
that...that don't fit.

1289
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,730
Well, that happens.

1290
01:28:05,737 --> 01:28:08,399
You are too damn smart
to be floating around here...

1291
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:10,874
pretending you don't see
all the holes in this bullshit.

1292
01:28:10,909 --> 01:28:12,809
Hey, listen.
l said l was confused.

1293
01:28:12,844 --> 01:28:15,005
l didn't say
l didn't believe in it.

1294
01:28:15,046 --> 01:28:17,139
All right. That's why
you have to stay open.

1295
01:28:17,182 --> 01:28:19,650
Right now, your anger
is consuming you here.

1296
01:28:19,684 --> 01:28:22,881
Your anger is shutting down
the brain God gave you.

1297
01:28:22,921 --> 01:28:24,912
God. You know, man?
You've been talking about...

1298
01:28:24,956 --> 01:28:26,787
what's going on with me
since l was in high school.

1299
01:28:26,825 --> 01:28:29,658
How the fuck do you know
what's going on inside me?

1300
01:28:29,694 --> 01:28:33,653
No, l know about me.
l know about this place.

1301
01:28:33,698 --> 01:28:35,666
l know about the place
you are in.

1302
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:38,464
What do you know
about the place l'm in?

1303
01:28:38,503 --> 01:28:40,664
There was a moment...

1304
01:28:40,705 --> 01:28:43,674
when l used to blame
everything and everyone...

1305
01:28:43,708 --> 01:28:46,176
for all
the pain and suffering...

1306
01:28:46,211 --> 01:28:48,338
and vile things
that happened to me...

1307
01:28:48,379 --> 01:28:50,939
that l saw happen to my people.

1308
01:28:50,982 --> 01:28:52,779
Used to blame everybody.

1309
01:28:52,817 --> 01:28:56,344
Blamed white people,
blamed society, blamed God.

1310
01:28:56,387 --> 01:28:59,550
l didn't get no answers 'cause
l asked the wrong questions.

1311
01:28:59,591 --> 01:29:02,116
You have to ask
the right question.

1312
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:03,388
Like what?

1313
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:08,731
Has anything you've done
made your life better?

1314
01:29:29,187 --> 01:29:30,677
You gotta help me, man.

1315
01:29:33,458 --> 01:29:35,187
Just help me.

1316
01:29:37,028 --> 01:29:39,087
Get me out of here, you know?

1317
01:29:41,866 --> 01:29:44,528
l'm up in four months
for review.

1318
01:29:46,204 --> 01:29:48,195
Put in a word for me.

1319
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:50,799
l already have. So you're
out there, and then what?

1320
01:29:50,842 --> 01:29:53,675
l don't want to fuck up
my family anymore.

1321
01:29:53,711 --> 01:29:55,975
l'll go as far away
as l can get.

1322
01:29:56,014 --> 01:29:57,777
That's not good enough.

1323
01:29:57,815 --> 01:30:01,251
You want my help,
you gotta do better than that.

1324
01:30:01,286 --> 01:30:03,777
My help is not unconditional.

1325
01:30:03,821 --> 01:30:07,052
Running just ain't good enough.

1326
01:30:39,757 --> 01:30:43,056
Fuck him. Fuck him.

1327
01:30:43,094 --> 01:30:44,789
Fuck him.
Let the niggers have him.

1328
01:30:46,264 --> 01:30:47,595
What's up, D?

1329
01:30:47,632 --> 01:30:50,829
What's all that bullshit
you pulled in the mess hall?

1330
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:54,937
You out of your fuckin' mind?
Are you fuckin' crazy?

1331
01:30:54,973 --> 01:30:57,271
D, look at me, man!

1332
01:30:57,308 --> 01:30:59,902
You can't make it in here
on your own.

1333
01:30:59,944 --> 01:31:02,037
l'm not afraid of
those fuckin' pussies.

1334
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,173
There was six of them,
and they jumped me.

1335
01:31:04,215 --> 01:31:06,615
That won't happen again.
l hope they fuckin' try.

1336
01:31:06,651 --> 01:31:09,176
Man, l'm not talking
about your peckerwood friends!

1337
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:11,518
They're protecting
your stupid ass!

1338
01:31:11,556 --> 01:31:15,390
You dissed them in public!
Now you're on your fuckin' own!

1339
01:31:15,426 --> 01:31:18,190
Yo, man, l'm talking about
the brothers, all right?

1340
01:31:18,229 --> 01:31:21,357
They'll fuck you, then
smoke your motherfucking ass!

1341
01:31:21,399 --> 01:31:24,027
Why don't you tell me
something l don't know?

1342
01:31:24,068 --> 01:31:26,229
You think l haven't
thought about that?

1343
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:29,728
lf they come for me, they come.
There ain't nothing l can do.

1344
01:31:31,009 --> 01:31:32,874
What can l do, man?

1345
01:31:37,749 --> 01:31:40,217
So l was right back
where l started.

1346
01:31:40,251 --> 01:31:42,310
Every day
l was sure it was my day.

1347
01:31:43,521 --> 01:31:46,490
Every time
l stepped out of my cell...

1348
01:31:46,524 --> 01:31:49,254
every time
l got in that shower...

1349
01:31:52,330 --> 01:31:54,230
l figured it was
only a matter of time...

1350
01:31:54,265 --> 01:31:56,256
before they made a move.

1351
01:31:57,435 --> 01:31:59,596
l just hoped it'd be quick.

1352
01:32:31,235 --> 01:32:33,567
But it never came.

1353
01:32:35,273 --> 01:32:36,535
l couldn't figure it out.

1354
01:32:36,574 --> 01:32:38,542
l knew some of them
were itching for it.

1355
01:32:38,576 --> 01:32:40,601
After awhile,
l just put my head down...

1356
01:32:40,645 --> 01:32:42,476
and read the stuff
that Sweeney sent me...

1357
01:32:42,513 --> 01:32:44,242
and l kept to myself.

1358
01:32:46,317 --> 01:32:49,946
Last six months in that place,
l was like a ghost.

1359
01:33:03,701 --> 01:33:06,226
What's up, man?
You getting out?

1360
01:33:08,339 --> 01:33:10,170
Come on, man.
What the fuck you waiting on?

1361
01:33:10,208 --> 01:33:12,335
Get the fuck on outta here, man.

1362
01:33:14,212 --> 01:33:16,237
Yeah, you know,
l got this funny feeling.

1363
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:18,145
Oh, yeah? What's that?

1364
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:21,279
l'm thinking maybe
the only reason...

1365
01:33:21,319 --> 01:33:23,184
l'm getting out of here
in one piece is you.

1366
01:33:24,689 --> 01:33:26,179
Come on, man!
Get the fuck outta here!

1367
01:33:26,224 --> 01:33:28,192
You think l'm gonna
put my neck on the line...

1368
01:33:28,226 --> 01:33:30,251
for some crazy ass peckerwood?

1369
01:33:30,294 --> 01:33:32,194
Yeah. Right.

1370
01:33:32,230 --> 01:33:34,391
Stupid.

1371
01:33:40,071 --> 01:33:41,732
That's what l thought.

1372
01:33:46,077 --> 01:33:48,307
l owe you, man.

1373
01:33:48,346 --> 01:33:50,507
Man, you don't owe me shit,
all right?

1374
01:33:53,518 --> 01:33:54,507
Yes, l do.

1375
01:34:04,695 --> 01:34:06,663
You'll be outta here in no time.

1376
01:34:06,697 --> 01:34:09,097
Man,
it's a piece of cake, all right?

1377
01:34:11,335 --> 01:34:13,166
Just take it easy
on the brothers, all right?

1378
01:34:13,204 --> 01:34:14,296
The brothers!

1379
01:34:24,715 --> 01:34:26,205
God, man.

1380
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:30,550
Sorry, Derek.

1381
01:34:31,556 --> 01:34:33,717
Sorry that happened to you.

1382
01:34:34,892 --> 01:34:38,020
Well, l'm not. l'm lucky.

1383
01:34:38,062 --> 01:34:41,054
l feel lucky,
'cause it's wrong, Dan.

1384
01:34:43,401 --> 01:34:45,198
lt's wrong,
and it was eating me up.

1385
01:34:45,236 --> 01:34:47,204
lt was gonna kill me.

1386
01:34:47,238 --> 01:34:49,263
And l kept asking myself
all the time...

1387
01:34:49,307 --> 01:34:53,243
how did l buy into this shit,
you know?

1388
01:34:54,912 --> 01:34:56,777
lt's just 'cause
l was pissed off.

1389
01:34:57,949 --> 01:35:01,180
Nothing l ever did
ever took that feeling away.

1390
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:05,655
l killed two guys, Danny.
l killed them.

1391
01:35:07,525 --> 01:35:09,686
And it didn't make me
feel any different.

1392
01:35:10,895 --> 01:35:12,226
Just got me more lost...

1393
01:35:12,263 --> 01:35:14,754
and l'm tired of feeling
pissed-off, Danny.

1394
01:35:14,799 --> 01:35:17,734
l'm just tired of it.

1395
01:35:17,768 --> 01:35:20,202
And l'm not telling you
what to do.

1396
01:35:21,539 --> 01:35:22,870
l'm really not.

1397
01:35:23,875 --> 01:35:26,036
But l need you to understand...

1398
01:35:27,879 --> 01:35:31,212
'cause l love you,
and you're my best friend.

1399
01:35:33,317 --> 01:35:35,217
Do you understand?

1400
01:35:35,253 --> 01:35:37,221
Yeah, l understand.

1401
01:35:40,725 --> 01:35:42,056
All right.

1402
01:35:46,063 --> 01:35:47,553
Jesus.

1403
01:36:04,282 --> 01:36:06,147
Hi. Everything OK?

1404
01:36:06,183 --> 01:36:07,582
Ah, everything's great.

1405
01:36:07,618 --> 01:36:10,382
Great. Yeah.
You wanna sleep in our room?

1406
01:36:10,421 --> 01:36:12,389
-No. Thank you.
-You sure?

1407
01:36:12,423 --> 01:36:15,654
Yeah. This is good.
Thank you.

1408
01:36:15,693 --> 01:36:18,184
All right. Come on, let's go.

1409
01:36:39,417 --> 01:36:40,406
Good night.

1410
01:37:47,385 --> 01:37:49,216
l'm gonna take a shower,
all right?

1411
01:38:23,421 --> 01:38:24,683
lt's hard to look back...

1412
01:38:24,722 --> 01:38:27,657
and see the truth
about people you love.

1413
01:38:27,691 --> 01:38:30,660
l think if you asked Derek why
it all went the way it did...

1414
01:38:30,694 --> 01:38:32,321
and where it all started...

1415
01:38:32,363 --> 01:38:35,196
he'd still say it started
when our father was murdered.

1416
01:38:36,367 --> 01:38:38,631
The truth is,
it started earlier.

1417
01:38:38,669 --> 01:38:41,900
Are we all meeting
for the game tonight?

1418
01:38:41,939 --> 01:38:43,167
Definitely.

1419
01:38:43,207 --> 01:38:44,834
All right,
Ben's Burger at 7:00...

1420
01:38:44,875 --> 01:38:46,206
then we go watch
the big guy play.

1421
01:38:48,712 --> 01:38:50,680
Psyching up for the game?

1422
01:38:50,714 --> 01:38:53,808
l'm always ready for that.
l got an English exam.

1423
01:38:53,851 --> 01:38:56,183
l'm having a heart attack.
l'm not ready.

1424
01:38:56,220 --> 01:38:58,211
What's the matter?
Afraid you'll get a "B"?

1425
01:38:58,255 --> 01:39:01,156
Might do you good. B-minus.

1426
01:39:01,192 --> 01:39:04,127
Hey, don't laugh.
This guy is different.

1427
01:39:04,161 --> 01:39:06,629
Dr. Sweeney.
This guy's unbelievable.

1428
01:39:06,664 --> 01:39:08,689
Unbelievable. l've never
had a teacher like this.

1429
01:39:08,732 --> 01:39:09,926
He's got two Ph.D.s.

1430
01:39:09,967 --> 01:39:13,596
l don't know what he's doing
teaching at our school.

1431
01:39:13,637 --> 01:39:14,865
What's he got you reading?

1432
01:39:14,905 --> 01:39:18,534
We got this essay exam
on "Native Son."

1433
01:39:18,576 --> 01:39:21,010
"Native Son"?
l don't know that.

1434
01:39:21,045 --> 01:39:22,603
That's a big surprise.

1435
01:39:23,714 --> 01:39:25,113
What? l read.

1436
01:39:26,350 --> 01:39:29,683
Honey, they don't teach
Tom Clancy in school.

1437
01:39:31,355 --> 01:39:33,152
Well, they don't.

1438
01:39:33,190 --> 01:39:34,680
So what is this "Native Son"?

1439
01:39:35,826 --> 01:39:38,192
lt's this book
about this black guy.

1440
01:39:38,229 --> 01:39:41,221
We're doing this whole
black literature unit.

1441
01:39:41,265 --> 01:39:43,699
ls it Black History Month?

1442
01:39:43,734 --> 01:39:46,168
No, it's just
this guy Sweeney, you know?

1443
01:39:46,203 --> 01:39:48,068
lt's part of the course now.

1444
01:39:54,712 --> 01:39:56,304
What?

1445
01:39:56,347 --> 01:39:59,180
Nothing. lt's just...

1446
01:39:59,216 --> 01:40:01,309
lt's everywhere l look now.

1447
01:40:01,352 --> 01:40:03,081
What?

1448
01:40:04,722 --> 01:40:07,520
This affirmative blacktion.

1449
01:40:07,558 --> 01:40:12,495
A few new books doesn't qualify
as affirmative black action.

1450
01:40:13,631 --> 01:40:15,428
Read the book,
ace the guy's test.

1451
01:40:15,466 --> 01:40:17,866
Just don't swallow
everything he feeds you whole.

1452
01:40:17,902 --> 01:40:19,460
Just 'cause you see it
on the evening news...

1453
01:40:19,503 --> 01:40:20,629
l know, but what?

1454
01:40:20,671 --> 01:40:22,696
All this stuff about
making everything equal.

1455
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:24,207
lt's not that simple.

1456
01:40:24,241 --> 01:40:26,209
Now you got this book
"Native Son."

1457
01:40:26,243 --> 01:40:28,211
What happened to
the other books in the course?

1458
01:40:28,245 --> 01:40:32,705
They're not any good anymore
because Mr. Two Ph.D. says so?

1459
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:35,218
Now you gotta trade in
great books for black books?

1460
01:40:35,252 --> 01:40:37,880
Does that make sense?

1461
01:40:37,922 --> 01:40:40,049
You gotta question
these things, Derek.

1462
01:40:40,090 --> 01:40:42,058
You gotta look
at the whole picture.

1463
01:40:42,092 --> 01:40:45,289
We're talking about books here.
l'm also talking about my job.

1464
01:40:45,329 --> 01:40:48,230
l got two black guys
on my squad now...

1465
01:40:48,265 --> 01:40:50,733
who got their job
over a couple of white guys...

1466
01:40:50,768 --> 01:40:52,827
who actually scored higher
on the test.

1467
01:40:52,870 --> 01:40:56,237
Does that make sense?

1468
01:40:56,273 --> 01:40:59,834
Everything's equal now, but l
got two guys watching my back...

1469
01:40:59,877 --> 01:41:03,836
responsible for my life
who aren't as good.

1470
01:41:03,881 --> 01:41:05,678
They only got the job
because they were black...

1471
01:41:05,716 --> 01:41:08,014
not because they were the best.

1472
01:41:08,052 --> 01:41:11,112
-That sucks.
-ls that what America's about?

1473
01:41:11,155 --> 01:41:13,180
No, America's about
best man for the job.

1474
01:41:13,224 --> 01:41:15,351
You do your best,
you get the job.

1475
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:18,361
This affirmative-action crap...

1476
01:41:18,395 --> 01:41:20,192
l don't know what that's about.

1477
01:41:20,231 --> 01:41:24,361
There's like some hidden agenda
or something going on.

1478
01:41:24,401 --> 01:41:25,868
You see what l'm saying?

1479
01:41:25,903 --> 01:41:28,497
Yeah, l do. l didn't
think about it like that.

1480
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:32,201
This guy, though--l don't know.

1481
01:41:32,243 --> 01:41:34,336
Dr. Sweeney,
he comes on so strong...

1482
01:41:34,378 --> 01:41:36,209
it's hard
not to listen to him...

1483
01:41:36,247 --> 01:41:38,772
but maybe some of
what he says is kinda...

1484
01:41:38,816 --> 01:41:40,044
lt's bullshit.

1485
01:41:41,252 --> 01:41:43,379
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

1486
01:41:43,420 --> 01:41:47,254
No. lt's nigger bullshit.

1487
01:41:49,593 --> 01:41:52,357
-You see that, don't you?
-Yeah.

1488
01:41:52,396 --> 01:41:54,227
You gotta watch out for that.

1489
01:41:54,265 --> 01:41:57,234
Yeah. No, l get what
you're saying. l will.

1490
01:41:58,769 --> 01:42:00,703
Good boy.

1491
01:42:00,738 --> 01:42:02,831
l'm proud of you.

1492
01:42:02,873 --> 01:42:04,534
Don't worry about it. l got it.

1493
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:12,168
And in about one minute...

1494
01:44:12,202 --> 01:44:14,727
l'm gonna watch the sun come up.

1495
01:44:14,772 --> 01:44:17,036
l don't know
if l've ever done that.

1496
01:44:18,175 --> 01:44:21,542
Anyway, we're gonna try to pick
things up and start over.

1497
01:44:21,578 --> 01:44:24,979
lt won't be easy,
but we're all together again...

1498
01:44:25,015 --> 01:44:27,108
and l feel good.

1499
01:44:28,218 --> 01:44:31,187
l'm not sure if this paper
is what you wanted--

1500
01:44:31,221 --> 01:44:33,189
if l hit
the social significance...

1501
01:44:33,223 --> 01:44:35,418
or whatever
you're looking for...

1502
01:44:35,459 --> 01:44:38,951
but for what it's worth,
thanks a lot.

1503
01:44:53,477 --> 01:44:57,743
Wow. You look great.
Look at you.

1504
01:44:59,416 --> 01:45:02,385
Yeah. Gotta dress up
for the parole officer.

1505
01:45:02,419 --> 01:45:03,716
ls she cute?

1506
01:45:03,754 --> 01:45:05,881
She is a fat guy named Hector...

1507
01:45:05,923 --> 01:45:09,154
-Oh. Well...
-So l'm out of luck.

1508
01:45:11,528 --> 01:45:13,155
l just gotta check in...

1509
01:45:13,197 --> 01:45:15,290
then l'm gonna see about
getting my old job back.

1510
01:45:15,332 --> 01:45:18,233
-Great.
-Good morning.

1511
01:45:19,403 --> 01:45:20,665
Davina, can you help?

1512
01:45:20,704 --> 01:45:22,194
Your sister's gonna help you.

1513
01:45:23,207 --> 01:45:24,936
You look great. Knock 'em dead.

1514
01:45:24,975 --> 01:45:26,499
Thanks.

1515
01:45:26,543 --> 01:45:28,977
Come on, sweetie. What would
you like to wear today?

1516
01:45:31,582 --> 01:45:34,813
-You do look good.
-Yeah? l feel silly.

1517
01:45:34,852 --> 01:45:37,218
-You look good.
-Yeah?

1518
01:45:39,223 --> 01:45:40,713
You feel good?

1519
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:46,688
Yeah. l feel, you know...

1520
01:45:46,730 --> 01:45:48,698
a little...

1521
01:45:48,732 --> 01:45:51,132
l'm getting there.

1522
01:45:52,736 --> 01:45:54,636
Listen...l don't know--

1523
01:45:56,273 --> 01:45:58,571
l don't know
if it's OKthat l'm here.

1524
01:46:02,679 --> 01:46:03,907
l want to be here.

1525
01:46:22,699 --> 01:46:24,428
-l'm gonna get a paper.
-Cool.

1526
01:46:41,885 --> 01:46:45,013
-What do you want?
-Maple bar and a large milk.

1527
01:46:45,055 --> 01:46:46,545
All right. l got it.

1528
01:46:51,028 --> 01:46:53,019
Let me get a coffee...

1529
01:46:53,063 --> 01:46:55,691
a maple bar,
and a large milk to go.

1530
01:46:55,732 --> 01:46:56,790
Right away.

1531
01:47:06,843 --> 01:47:09,641
Derek, we need to talk.

1532
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:11,147
What's going on?

1533
01:47:11,181 --> 01:47:15,641
Cameron Alexander and Seth Ryan
are at the lCU at St. John's.

1534
01:47:15,686 --> 01:47:17,153
They were jumped last night
near Ben's Burgers.

1535
01:47:17,187 --> 01:47:18,984
How bad?

1536
01:47:19,022 --> 01:47:20,649
Well, it looks
like they're gonna live.

1537
01:47:20,691 --> 01:47:23,785
-Then they got lucky.
-Somebody's gotta lose, though.

1538
01:47:26,597 --> 01:47:27,586
What?

1539
01:47:28,865 --> 01:47:32,028
We were kinda hoping maybe
you'd talk to your old crew--

1540
01:47:32,069 --> 01:47:33,661
Come on. No way.

1541
01:47:33,704 --> 01:47:36,832
lf there's anybody they're
gonna listen to, it's you.

1542
01:47:36,873 --> 01:47:39,103
No. l hate to tell you,
but l'm out, OK?

1543
01:47:39,142 --> 01:47:41,110
Those guys are probably
gunning for me now.

1544
01:47:41,144 --> 01:47:43,169
We're asking
for your help here, Derek.

1545
01:47:43,213 --> 01:47:45,078
Did you tell him
l was gonna do this?

1546
01:47:51,888 --> 01:47:54,186
This has got nothing
to do with me anymore.

1547
01:47:54,224 --> 01:47:57,193
Yes, it does. lt has
everything to do with you.

1548
01:47:57,227 --> 01:47:59,855
God, what are you doing to me?
l'm doing my best!

1549
01:47:59,896 --> 01:48:02,626
l'm going like this just to keep
my family in the clear.

1550
01:48:02,666 --> 01:48:04,099
Don't ask me to fix
this fuckin' situation!

1551
01:48:04,134 --> 01:48:06,102
-l'm not asking that.
-lt was there before me.

1552
01:48:06,136 --> 01:48:09,128
You helped create it.
You wanna take a break now?

1553
01:48:09,172 --> 01:48:10,901
You take a break,
you'll find no peace.

1554
01:48:10,941 --> 01:48:14,104
The way to find peace
is to stick.

1555
01:48:14,144 --> 01:48:16,135
lt's not gonna make
a fuckin' bit of difference.

1556
01:48:16,179 --> 01:48:19,307
-lt might.
-Not a bit.

1557
01:48:19,349 --> 01:48:22,978
l mean, do you know
what you're asking me to do?

1558
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:25,989
Yes. l'm asking you to do
whatever's in your power to do.

1559
01:48:27,491 --> 01:48:29,789
Oh, man.

1560
01:48:32,529 --> 01:48:33,860
Fuck.

1561
01:48:38,468 --> 01:48:39,867
All right.

1562
01:48:41,705 --> 01:48:44,674
You know what you're gonna do?
Get me shot by white boys.

1563
01:48:44,708 --> 01:48:46,676
l doubt it.

1564
01:48:46,710 --> 01:48:49,770
We're all gonna have a laugh
at that, let me tell ya.

1565
01:48:50,981 --> 01:48:54,417
l'm gonna take him to school.
l'll be back in half an hour.

1566
01:48:54,451 --> 01:48:55,850
Come on.

1567
01:48:55,886 --> 01:48:59,686
Hey, you. You got something
good for me this morning?

1568
01:48:59,723 --> 01:49:00,951
l'll give it to you,
Dr. Sweeney.

1569
01:49:00,991 --> 01:49:02,288
-Yeah, OK.
-All right.

1570
01:49:07,064 --> 01:49:09,055
What's goin' on?

1571
01:49:14,171 --> 01:49:15,331
Come on, let's go.

1572
01:49:30,987 --> 01:49:34,150
lt's just so bad for Seth, man.

1573
01:49:34,191 --> 01:49:36,853
l wonder how bad
they got fucked up.

1574
01:49:38,128 --> 01:49:40,528
l'm glad they're not dead.
Other than that, l don't care.

1575
01:49:42,032 --> 01:49:43,499
Should we visit them?

1576
01:49:43,533 --> 01:49:46,161
No. Definitely not.

1577
01:49:46,203 --> 01:49:48,228
Just stay out of it.

1578
01:49:48,271 --> 01:49:52,173
Listen. l saw a car cruising
by the house last night...

1579
01:49:52,209 --> 01:49:54,006
when l pulled
out of there with Seth.

1580
01:49:54,044 --> 01:49:57,172
lf you get home before me today,
give a look around the street.

1581
01:49:57,214 --> 01:49:59,705
Make sure
there's nothing going on.

1582
01:50:00,717 --> 01:50:02,810
Man, this is bad.

1583
01:50:05,055 --> 01:50:08,024
-They're after you, man.
-lt'll cool off.

1584
01:50:08,058 --> 01:50:11,585
lf l made it through Chino,
this should be a piece of cake.

1585
01:50:13,897 --> 01:50:14,886
You gonna be OK?

1586
01:50:20,103 --> 01:50:21,229
What are you gonna do?

1587
01:50:21,271 --> 01:50:24,707
l'll work it out.
Keep your head up, all right?

1588
01:50:24,741 --> 01:50:28,108
Things are gonna be fine.
lt's gonna be fine.

1589
01:50:28,145 --> 01:50:29,976
Go turn that paper in.

1590
01:50:31,748 --> 01:50:34,911
All right. See ya.

1591
01:50:34,951 --> 01:50:36,248
Come here.

1592
01:50:42,092 --> 01:50:43,525
l'll see you at home.

1593
01:50:45,295 --> 01:50:46,853
All right?

1594
01:50:48,098 --> 01:50:50,692
Yeah, l'll see you.
Good luck, all right?

1595
01:50:50,734 --> 01:50:53,760
-Yeah.
-See you later.

1596
01:50:59,509 --> 01:51:01,943
-Gonna be late.
-We better go.

1597
01:51:02,946 --> 01:51:04,345
All right. Come on.

1598
01:51:27,304 --> 01:51:28,328
Bye.

1599
01:51:28,371 --> 01:51:31,568
l'll catch up with you.
See you later.

1600
01:52:53,356 --> 01:52:55,187
Get out of my way!

1601
01:52:55,225 --> 01:52:56,988
All right! Let him go!

1602
01:52:59,529 --> 01:53:00,621
Oh, no.

1603
01:53:03,767 --> 01:53:05,860
Aw, Jesus.

1604
01:53:29,392 --> 01:53:31,189
Oh, Jesus.

1605
01:53:31,227 --> 01:53:33,218
God, what did l do?

1606
01:54:01,358 --> 01:54:05,317
So l guess this is where
l tell you what l learned.

1607
01:54:05,362 --> 01:54:07,193
My conclusion, right?

1608
01:54:08,198 --> 01:54:12,134
Well, my conclusion is
hate is baggage.

1609
01:54:12,969 --> 01:54:16,166
Life's too short
to be pissed off all the time.

1610
01:54:16,206 --> 01:54:18,367
lt's just not worth it.

1611
01:54:21,144 --> 01:54:24,671
Derek says it's always good
to end a paper with a quote.

1612
01:54:24,714 --> 01:54:27,182
He says someone else
has already said it best...

1613
01:54:27,217 --> 01:54:29,185
so if you can't top it...

1614
01:54:29,219 --> 01:54:31,687
steal from them
and go out strong.

1615
01:54:31,721 --> 01:54:34,212
So l picked a guy
l thought you'd like.

1616
01:54:36,059 --> 01:54:39,688
"We are not enemies,
but friends.

1617
01:54:39,729 --> 01:54:42,027
"We must not be enemies.

1618
01:54:42,065 --> 01:54:44,533
"Though passion
may have strained...

1619
01:54:44,567 --> 01:54:47,365
"we must not break
our bonds of affection.

1620
01:54:47,404 --> 01:54:50,202
"The mystic chords of memory...

1621
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:52,731
"will swell
when again touched...

1622
01:54:52,776 --> 01:54:54,744
"as surely they will be...

1623
01:54:54,778 --> 01:54:57,747
"by the better angels
of our nature."
