1
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:08,202
(police radio faintly heard)

2
00:02:16,047 --> 00:02:20,359
(police radio) It is urgent - repeat: urgent -
that you give the sheriff a call.

3
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:22,642
I say again, Coogan, call the sheriff.

4
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:26,037
It is urgent - repeat: urgent -
that you call the sheriff...

5
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:48,921
(rocks clattering)

6
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:20,158
Put your pants on, Chief.

7
00:08:22,287 --> 00:08:24,278
(lndian sings in Navajo)

8
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,442
Mm... Coogan.

9
00:08:55,527 --> 00:08:57,518
Mm-hm.

10
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:03,081
- He still in Phoenix?
- Mm-hm.

11
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:06,361
- Expecting anyone else?
- Mm-mm.

12
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:08,438
(singing continues)

13
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:12,638
What the hell's that?

14
00:09:15,327 --> 00:09:17,318
Oh. Prisoner.

15
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:20,479
- uh-huh? What'd he do?
- Just killed a woman.

16
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:22,558
Just his wife, that's all.

17
00:09:23,047 --> 00:09:24,639
uh-uh.

18
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:44,483
How long you been trackin' him?

19
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:46,558
Three days.

20
00:09:46,647 --> 00:09:48,638
You need a bath.

21
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:53,558
- After.
- Now.

22
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:56,158
- Now?
- uh-huh.

23
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,238
Hm.

24
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:07,958
Stop!

25
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:13,196
What the hell for?

26
00:10:14,687 --> 00:10:16,678
Back it up!

27
00:10:26,847 --> 00:10:28,326
Go on in!

28
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:40,725
- Need a bigger target?
- There ain't none in this county, baby.

29
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,399
(gunshot)

30
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:47,558
When I assign a deputy to a roadblock, I
expect him to be there when I come back.

31
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,797
- Mornin', Sheriff.
- Millie.

32
00:10:50,447 --> 00:10:53,678
Ever cross your mind I might
accidentally know what I'm doin'?

33
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:55,678
You mind handin' me the soap?

34
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:05,037
Direct disobedience to orders, dereliction
of duty, leaving an assigned post.

35
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:07,277
Those are the first three I think of.

36
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:10,803
- The fugitive's on the porch.
- I saw him. That's just one thing more.

37
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,559
Get my back, will you?

38
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:16,003
That's a prisoner out there.
Not an animal to be tethered to a rail.

39
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:18,442
- My shirt's in there on the bed.
- For what?

40
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:22,440
- The badge on it comes right off.
- You wanna play the lonesome boy, fine!

41
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:26,566
You'll get a gutful. Every lousy
one-man job that comes along.

42
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:30,596
- Got one waiting for you right now.
- That so?

43
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,919
Be in front of my desk in one hour.
Don't bother to stand up and salute.

44
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:39,398
One hour!

45
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:42,198
(Millie squeals)

46
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:08,878
Texas?

47
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:10,958
Arizona.

48
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:13,758
My home town.

49
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:18,159
- Business trip?
- You might call it that.

50
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:22,396
- Rancher?
- Deputy sheriff.

51
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:27,843
- Is that right? May I ask what you're...
- Extraditing a fugitive.

52
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:31,203
One of your cowboys
step outta line in our fair city?

53
00:12:31,287 --> 00:12:33,755
No. One of your boys
stepped outta line in ours.

54
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:02,637
Head of the line, cowboy.

55
00:13:03,447 --> 00:13:05,438
- That's luggage.
- What?

56
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:10,159
- That thing in your hand, that's luggage.
- So, it's luggage.

57
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,000
So it's 50 cents extra
for a piece of luggage.

58
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:18,038
Where to, cowboy?

59
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,919
177 East 104th Street.

60
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:51,956
- You from Texas?
- Arizona.

61
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:55,757
- You with the rodeo?
- Nope.

62
00:13:57,287 --> 00:13:59,596
Everybody wear them clothes in Arizona?

63
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:05,282
No. Lifeguards wear swim trunks.
Nurses wear white dresses.

64
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:07,838
What do they wear here?

65
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:24,636
That's $2.95, including the luggage.

66
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:30,556
Tell me, how many stores are there
named Bloomingdale's in this town?

67
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:34,720
- One. Why?
- We passed it twice.

68
00:14:35,927 --> 00:14:38,646
It's still $2.95 including the luggage.

69
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:40,805
Yeah.

70
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:44,118
Well, there's three dollars,
including the tip.

71
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,357
Oh, sure, you want him arrested.

72
00:14:56,447 --> 00:15:00,201
What's gonna happen when
we get him downtown? I'll tell ya what.

73
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:04,519
You'll say it was a big mistake and swear
you fell downstairs, just like last time.

74
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:06,962
But when he's arrested, I feel sorry.

75
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:08,924
Look, Mrs Amador...

76
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:11,840
- You want something?
- Deputy Coogan.

77
00:15:12,047 --> 00:15:15,562
- Is that the whole thing?
- I'm looking for a Lieutenant McElroy.

78
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:17,285
up the stairs.

79
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:21,201
Now, look. Mrs Amador,
why don't you just divorce the bum?

80
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,517
- I cannot do that!
- You got to!

81
00:15:23,607 --> 00:15:26,326
How can I divorce? We're not married.

82
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:35,766
(woman) up there, stickin' yourself
in the arm with that poison?

83
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:41,482
(second woman) Soliciting what?

84
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,719
Look, Officer, when a lady can't
adjust her stockings, the world's...

85
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:47,763
Hey, Slim!

86
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:51,886
Sir, Third Avenue's a public street.
We've got as much right to as anybody...

87
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:58,558
- Get her.
- Look at all that, in two-inch heels!

88
00:15:58,647 --> 00:16:02,003
Do you work out? Do you?

89
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,679
(man) Come in!

90
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:06,076
We got no chance
of getting a conviction.

91
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:08,442
- I got a confession!
- Be right with you.

92
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:10,961
Look, do you read?
Do you take a morning paper?

93
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:14,278
There's such a thing as a supreme court.
Did you ever hear of it?

94
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:17,359
You can be damn sure
DiBlasio's lawyer has.

95
00:16:17,447 --> 00:16:20,200
- What's your problem?
- My name's Coogan.

96
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:21,402
So?

97
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:24,445
You got a James Ringerman here
you're holding for me?

98
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:27,678
Oh, yeah. Deputy sheriff, Texas, right?

99
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:33,085
- Arizona. I have the papers for him here.
- I'm sure you do. Leave your number...

100
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,362
- Should I spring DiBlasio?
- No, hold him...

101
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:37,438
(phone rings)

102
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:40,282
Lieutenant McElroy here.

103
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:43,916
No. Hold him until I check
with the district attorney's office.

104
00:16:44,007 --> 00:16:45,122
- You got it?
- Yes.

105
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:47,038
What number?

106
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:49,561
Your phone number,
hotel where you're staying.

107
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:52,844
- I'm not staying anyplace.
- Well, find yourself a place.

108
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:55,999
- Ringerman's not ready.
- Oh? Why not?

109
00:16:56,847 --> 00:16:59,600
He took a little trip.

110
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:03,921
Look, I understood that you were
holding him in custody here for me.

111
00:17:04,647 --> 00:17:08,003
An LSD trip.
He's in the prison ward at Bellevue.

112
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,596
In jail?

113
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:13,236
- Do you want a written report?
- Without the search.

114
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:14,680
- Yes, sir.
- (phone rings)

115
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,962
How did he get this LSD in jail?

116
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:20,801
We serve it every day like peanuts
at the cocktail hour.

117
00:17:20,887 --> 00:17:22,605
Lieutenant McElroy.

118
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,676
No.

119
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:26,804
- Because I said no, that's all.
- uh... Lieutenant...

120
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:30,926
I want everybody to feel free
to just come bustin' in here night and day.

121
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:34,636
- It's Mrs Fowler.
- Oh, yeah.

122
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:37,161
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Look, Lieutenant...

123
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:40,398
You can't make out a rape complaint
and then just take off.

124
00:17:40,487 --> 00:17:42,842
We've got an APB out for that guy.

125
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:44,997
The streets aren't safe in this town.

126
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:48,159
uh... Fowler. That's it. Fowler.

127
00:17:48,247 --> 00:17:51,205
- When does he get out of the hospital?
- Hm? Who?

128
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:55,963
- Ringerman! Who are we talkin' about?
- When the doctor says he can get out.

129
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:59,164
- Take a few days, see the town.
- I've already seen the town.

130
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:03,604
You like orange juice? You'll love
Broadway. Ask anybody where it is.

131
00:18:04,607 --> 00:18:07,405
You made another rape complaint
four months ago.

132
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:09,685
Attempted rape.

133
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:16,004
And I sent a detective up
to talk to you at the time.

134
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:19,485
He tried to rape me, too.

135
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,127
Did I ever try to rape you?

136
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:29,638
- Get her outta here!
- Lady, you need a psychiatrist.

137
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:32,036
I went to one and he tried to rape me, too.

138
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:34,118
Out, out!

139
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:39,116
You still here?

140
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:43,200
Look, Lieutenant. Suppose, um...

141
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:47,678
Suppose I sign a receipt for the prisoner.
Then he'd be my responsibility, right?

142
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:51,362
Look, Tex, the only way you'll
ever lay your hands on James Ringerman

143
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:54,359
is if a New York State judge
renders him into your custody.

144
00:18:54,447 --> 00:18:57,644
You can't think about that
until he's released from Bellevue.

145
00:18:57,727 --> 00:18:59,957
- When will that be?
- A week, a month?

146
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:03,437
- How the hell do I know? I'm no doctor.
- (phone rings)

147
00:19:03,527 --> 00:19:05,358
Lieutenant McElroy.

148
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:08,041
Don't call us, we'll call you.

149
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,281
Huh? Yeah. I got it
right here on my desk.

150
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:17,965
Sorry I'm late. I'm Julie Roth,
your sister's probation officer.

151
00:19:20,487 --> 00:19:24,844
- How come you never been to the place?
- I've been there lots. You're never home.

152
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:27,316
Come up some night,
I'll show you the roof.

153
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:29,398
I've seen a roof.

154
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:32,798
Hey, that I like.

155
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:39,082
You know somethin'?
You're pretty good-looking for a cop.

156
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:40,839
Thank you.

157
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:45,239
Next you're gonna ask me if I make it
with all the good-looking fuzz here.

158
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:48,524
Well, the answer is no, not all of them.

159
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:54,035
Nothing you say or do will shock
or upset me, so let's cut out the nonsense.

160
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,762
What do you know! I can feel your heart.

161
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:01,838
OK, Joe, you've shown me.

162
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:06,357
Wow, feel that thing beat.

163
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:09,440
Joe, will you please keep
your hands to yourself.

164
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:12,440
Tick, tick, tick.

165
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:15,161
Guess you didn't hear the lady,
did you, boy?

166
00:20:15,527 --> 00:20:19,042
Cool it, cowboy.
There's plenty here for both of us, huh?

167
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:24,162
Tick, tick, tick.

168
00:20:29,607 --> 00:20:32,997
What the hell do you think you're doing?
And who are you, anyway?

169
00:20:33,087 --> 00:20:36,875
- I'm a cop, lady, just like you are.
- I don't happen to be a cop.

170
00:20:37,687 --> 00:20:39,439
- Are you all right, Joe?
- Yeah.

171
00:20:39,527 --> 00:20:40,755
Let me see.

172
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:45,762
Look, I'm a stranger in town, ma'am. I'm
not from Texas. Arizona. I just thought...

173
00:20:45,847 --> 00:20:47,963
There was no need for violence.

174
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:51,005
Well, yeah. I can see that now.
I'm sorry about that.

175
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:54,284
- I think you should apologise.
- OK, ma'am, I apologise.

176
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:57,165
- Not to me! To him!
- Now, wait just a minute.

177
00:20:57,287 --> 00:20:59,278
No, I don't want no apologies.

178
00:21:00,647 --> 00:21:02,717
Just keep that creep away from me, huh?

179
00:21:02,807 --> 00:21:04,525
Joe...

180
00:21:04,607 --> 00:21:06,996
Joe! Joe!

181
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:12,683
Thanks.

182
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:17,124
Do you know how long
it's taken me to find that boy?

183
00:21:17,207 --> 00:21:19,437
- I'll be glad to go get him for you.
- No.

184
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:23,406
- I'll be glad to bring him back, really.
- By the scruff of the neck?

185
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:26,636
And we wonder why these kids hate cops.

186
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:33,559
Found something about New York
you like, Tex?

187
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:38,842
He just calls me that.
Really my name is Coogan.

188
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:40,997
If I fouled things up for you, I'm sorry.

189
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:43,760
- I just thought...
- Did you? Think?

190
00:21:44,447 --> 00:21:46,324
Well, yeah. I just...

191
00:21:46,407 --> 00:21:49,683
We don't treat people like that
in New York, Mr Coogan.

192
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,235
- How do you treat 'em?
- I doubt it'd interest you.

193
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:55,160
- Try me.
- It's a long story.

194
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,238
I just happen to have some time.

195
00:21:57,767 --> 00:21:59,405
Here.

196
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:04,319
Maybe you know a nice little place
we can have lunch and talk about it.

197
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,762
Sorry, Mr Coogan. You're not my type.

198
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:08,838
How can you tell?

199
00:22:09,927 --> 00:22:14,000
- The hat, maybe.
- Oh, that? That comes right off.

200
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:19,046
Are you dense, or just stubborn?

201
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:21,798
Hungry mostly.

202
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:23,878
Come on.

203
00:22:24,687 --> 00:22:29,363
You know, I'm always interested
in new techniques.

204
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:43,037
Psychophysiological, hm?

205
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:45,677
It's a branch of psychology
that deals with

206
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:48,998
the fundamental relationships
between mind and body.

207
00:22:49,087 --> 00:22:52,284
So it's psychophysiological autogenesis.

208
00:22:52,647 --> 00:22:54,638
Alphagenics for short.

209
00:22:54,727 --> 00:22:56,763
- Alphagenic?
- Mm.

210
00:22:59,407 --> 00:23:02,126
I've been experimenting
with it up at my place...

211
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:05,119
- You live near here?
- Not far.

212
00:23:05,807 --> 00:23:08,321
You do this experiment
at your house, hm?

213
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:12,878
Oh, yes, it's much better there.
It's warm and informal. At the precinct...

214
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:16,277
- Seems like an interesting setup. In fact...
- Thank you.

215
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:18,437
- What do you want?
- Your check, sir.

216
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:21,439
- Yeah, I saw it.
- Oh, it is getting late.

217
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:23,597
Why don't you just run along, huh?

218
00:23:24,647 --> 00:23:26,797
- Yes, sir.
- Waiter, just a minute.

219
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:30,517
It's after three. I have to be going.

220
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:36,360
- What are you doin'?
- Dutch.

221
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:40,201
- You're the girl, aren't you?
- There have been rumours to that effect.

222
00:23:40,287 --> 00:23:43,040
Well, you just sit back
and act like one.

223
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:45,406
How?

224
00:23:45,487 --> 00:23:47,796
Take everything you can get, that's how.

225
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,802
Is that the way the girls act in Arizona?

226
00:23:51,407 --> 00:23:54,638
That's the way everybody
acts everywhere.

227
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:56,718
You too?

228
00:23:57,607 --> 00:24:00,883
- Especially me.
- (waiter) Thank you.

229
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,198
You're welcome.

230
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:14,517
Thank you.

231
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:16,598
You're welcome.

232
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:22,961
- uh... I'll take my bag.
- That's all right. I'll carry it.

233
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:25,925
- But I have to go now.
- Fine. Where to?

234
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:28,760
You don't understand.
I have a dozen things to do.

235
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:32,556
- Good. I'll help you.
- But I'll be all day and half the night.

236
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:35,558
I've got nothing but time.

237
00:24:36,887 --> 00:24:38,878
(' seductive instrumental)

238
00:24:44,047 --> 00:24:46,720
I wouldn't get too comfortable,
Mr Coogan.

239
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:49,836
Nobody calls me "Mr"
with my boots off.

240
00:24:53,127 --> 00:24:55,118
I don't know your first name.

241
00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:57,880
How about just Coogan,
without the "Mr"?

242
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,358
Julie.

243
00:25:11,847 --> 00:25:13,963
I don't remember telling you mine.

244
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:18,677
Yeah, well, that's my police trainin'.

245
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:21,719
(mimics) Po-lice trainin'?

246
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,562
Yeah.

247
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:27,357
See, it's on your magazines here.

248
00:25:27,447 --> 00:25:30,166
Name and address of the subscription.

249
00:25:30,887 --> 00:25:33,606
(laughs)

250
00:25:39,327 --> 00:25:41,318
How are you?

251
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:45,126
I thought you wanted
to learn about alphagenics.

252
00:25:45,207 --> 00:25:48,005
Oh, I do. I do.

253
00:25:48,687 --> 00:25:50,678
Good.

254
00:25:57,407 --> 00:25:59,398
My files.

255
00:26:00,647 --> 00:26:02,797
I only handle young, single girls.

256
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,319
Yeah.

257
00:26:06,407 --> 00:26:08,398
Me too.

258
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,198
Now, briefly...

259
00:26:17,887 --> 00:26:20,845
autogenesis is basically
a programme of...

260
00:26:21,887 --> 00:26:24,037
self-regeneration,

261
00:26:24,127 --> 00:26:27,244
- the main point of attack being the...
- What?

262
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:29,887
core of self-contempt

263
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:32,037
that is always a principal factor.

264
00:26:35,247 --> 00:26:37,203
This we do by means...

265
00:26:37,287 --> 00:26:39,801
of a tape recorder,

266
00:26:39,887 --> 00:26:41,878
which is right here.

267
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,559
(clears throat)

268
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:47,276
The programme is based on
behavioural psychological principles,

269
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:51,280
the position being
that all human and animal response...

270
00:26:52,207 --> 00:26:54,675
is the result of...

271
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:56,758
conditioned reflex...

272
00:26:57,807 --> 00:27:04,042
which, as you know, is simply
a particular bodily response...

273
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:07,598
to a particular...

274
00:27:09,247 --> 00:27:11,238
stimulus.

275
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:13,998
(phone rings)

276
00:27:16,647 --> 00:27:18,842
- Phone.
- Forget it.

277
00:27:27,327 --> 00:27:28,646
(clears throat)

278
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:30,718
Hello?

279
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:32,798
Yes, this is she. Who?

280
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:36,245
Laura!

281
00:27:36,327 --> 00:27:38,318
(whispers) It's one of my girls.

282
00:27:38,927 --> 00:27:40,804
Yes?

283
00:27:40,887 --> 00:27:42,878
Oh, not him again.

284
00:27:43,727 --> 00:27:48,437
Now, you know that the terms of your
probation specifically stated that...

285
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:51,238
Well, of course it's difficult.

286
00:27:52,927 --> 00:27:55,441
I understand that better than you think.

287
00:27:57,487 --> 00:28:00,081
Well, yes, he's...

288
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:02,601
You can always say no, can't you?

289
00:28:02,687 --> 00:28:04,678
No.

290
00:28:07,447 --> 00:28:09,756
All right. Fine.

291
00:28:09,847 --> 00:28:11,838
I'll expect you in five minutes.

292
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:18,358
Five minutes.

293
00:28:21,607 --> 00:28:23,598
Yeah.

294
00:28:36,807 --> 00:28:38,798
Five minutes.

295
00:29:43,887 --> 00:29:45,878
- Yeah?
- Single.

296
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:49,123
How long you gonna be staying?

297
00:29:49,207 --> 00:29:51,675
No longer than I can help it.

298
00:29:51,767 --> 00:29:54,440
All right. Room 304.

299
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:57,198
That'll be $7, in advance.

300
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:01,796
- The sign says five.
- Seven without luggage.

301
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:07,365
That ain't luggage.

302
00:30:07,447 --> 00:30:10,007
A cab driver in this town'd
give you an argument.

303
00:30:10,087 --> 00:30:13,682
- Do you want the room or not?
- No, no, I'll take it.

304
00:30:31,887 --> 00:30:33,878
Excuse me, sir.

305
00:30:37,447 --> 00:30:39,438
After you, sir.

306
00:30:44,327 --> 00:30:48,206
- You really hit the jackpot tonight, sir.
- Yeah.

307
00:30:48,287 --> 00:30:52,121
Fell right into it
and came up with a rose in your nose.

308
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:54,482
A lonesome lady just down the hall.

309
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:57,365
I think she was stood up on a date
tonight.

310
00:30:58,047 --> 00:31:01,835
And beautiful. I mean, all the tools.

311
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:04,202
So long.

312
00:31:04,287 --> 00:31:06,357
No trouble to give a knock on the door.

313
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,438
So long, buddy.

314
00:31:29,127 --> 00:31:31,118
Hi.

315
00:31:32,007 --> 00:31:33,998
Help a lady in distress?

316
00:31:37,487 --> 00:31:39,682
Wrong room.

317
00:31:54,807 --> 00:31:58,436
I'm a girl who never had trouble
with a zipper in her life...

318
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:01,322
until tonight.

319
00:32:01,407 --> 00:32:03,682
Be an angel man.

320
00:32:04,687 --> 00:32:06,678
up or down?

321
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:11,555
Well, let's put it this way, sport:
you're drivin'.

322
00:32:14,327 --> 00:32:16,079
Out.

323
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,158
What's the matter?

324
00:32:20,927 --> 00:32:24,806
- Are you some kind of religious fanatic?
- Come on, out.

325
00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:27,685
All right, you cheap bum.
Who needs your lousy action?

326
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:29,758
Hold on a minute.

327
00:32:44,447 --> 00:32:46,085
Texas faggot!

328
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:05,361
You Texas boys get up early.

329
00:33:05,447 --> 00:33:07,483
It's Arizona.

330
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:11,879
And I figured I'd better get here
before the cuckoos start gatherin'.

331
00:33:11,967 --> 00:33:14,083
What do you want?

332
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:16,362
Ringerman... now.

333
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:21,438
You've got a problem.

334
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:24,798
You don't listen.

335
00:33:26,567 --> 00:33:28,046
Number one.

336
00:33:28,127 --> 00:33:32,279
First you go down to the district attorney's
office where they check your papers.

337
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:36,201
The affidavit of flight,
request for extradition, and so forth.

338
00:33:36,887 --> 00:33:38,286
Number two.

339
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:41,916
Then you go down to the Supreme Court
of the State of New York,

340
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:46,000
where Judge Acosta renders
the fugitive into your custody.

341
00:33:47,447 --> 00:33:49,358
But you can't do anything

342
00:33:49,447 --> 00:33:54,202
until they release Ringerman
from the prison ward at Bellevue. OK?

343
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:04,159
- You could get him.
- I'm a busy man.

344
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:06,637
You could walk right in
and get him for me.

345
00:34:06,847 --> 00:34:11,841
Tex, you're getting on my nerves. What
gives with you people? Too much sun?

346
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:17,205
Let's make it simple. Get outta my office
and don't come back until I send for you.

347
00:34:18,967 --> 00:34:21,322
Coogan. Piute County Sheriff's Office.

348
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:24,717
Lieutenant McElroy sent me up here
to pick up a James Ringerman.

349
00:34:24,807 --> 00:34:26,365
Ringerman?

350
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:29,359
Yeah. Said he'd appreciate it
if you'd snap it up a little.

351
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:33,838
He's parked in the ambulance zone.
The man said he can only stay a second.

352
00:34:46,847 --> 00:34:49,281
If you'd be kind enough to open this one.

353
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:51,517
No, not without a medical release.

354
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:56,076
I understood that medical release
went through last night.

355
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:57,486
Not listed here.

356
00:34:57,567 --> 00:35:00,127
It probably hasn't reached
this department yet.

357
00:35:00,207 --> 00:35:04,598
If you'll open up here, I can straighten
it out with the doctor right away.

358
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:07,440
I can't let you through.
He's already got one visitor.

359
00:35:07,527 --> 00:35:09,006
Oh?

360
00:35:09,087 --> 00:35:11,362
- That's it, huh?
- That's it.

361
00:35:14,367 --> 00:35:16,358
What's your name, Officer?

362
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:21,003
- What for?
- Well, when somebody asks me

363
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:25,000
why Judge Acosta of the New York State
Supreme Court's been kept waiting,

364
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:27,198
I gotta give 'em a name.

365
00:35:27,287 --> 00:35:29,676
- Yeah. Now, just a minute...
- Do I get the name

366
00:35:29,767 --> 00:35:32,839
or do I have to have Lieutenant McElroy
come and get it for me?

367
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:35,236
Just a second!

368
00:35:39,087 --> 00:35:41,681
Everybody tells me somethin' different.

369
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:44,398
Rudy!

370
00:35:45,607 --> 00:35:47,598
Take him in to see Ringerman.

371
00:35:48,807 --> 00:35:50,798
You'll call the doc, huh?

372
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:55,956
Call the doc.

373
00:35:56,047 --> 00:35:58,436
Well, looky, looky, looky!

374
00:35:58,527 --> 00:36:01,280
And they say the West
ain't wild any more!

375
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,358
Hey, if it ain't Hoot Gibson!

376
00:36:03,447 --> 00:36:05,438
(taunting continues)

377
00:36:06,927 --> 00:36:09,805
(man) ' Give me a home
where the buffalo roam

378
00:36:09,887 --> 00:36:12,685
' And the deer and the antelope play

379
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:14,758
(singer blows raspberries)

380
00:36:24,087 --> 00:36:26,282
(prisoner) Well, well, looky here.

381
00:36:27,047 --> 00:36:29,277
Coogan.

382
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:32,359
Hey, Linny, say hello to the fuzz
that busted me in Arizona.

383
00:36:32,447 --> 00:36:35,439
Yeah. Man-burger.

384
00:36:35,567 --> 00:36:38,365
Did you come to take
me back, cowboy? Huh?

385
00:36:39,047 --> 00:36:41,038
This cat's got wild vibes.

386
00:36:41,847 --> 00:36:44,759
Hey, man, she's pickin' up
on your vibrations.

387
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:47,957
You wanna know the thing about me?

388
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:52,960
I got this little green worm in my head.

389
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:55,038
(Ringerman sniggers)

390
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,438
And it glows in the dark.

391
00:36:59,527 --> 00:37:02,200
That's the thing about me.

392
00:37:03,687 --> 00:37:06,155
- I'm Coogan.
- Yes, Rollins told me.

393
00:37:06,247 --> 00:37:08,238
Apparently there's been a mix-up.

394
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:12,036
- Can he travel?
- How soon were you planning to leave?

395
00:37:13,247 --> 00:37:16,717
I was trying to make a helicopter
in 45 minutes at Pan Am.

396
00:37:16,807 --> 00:37:20,925
- I'd hate to miss that connection.
- Yes, I understand, but...

397
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:24,602
there's always danger of residual
psychotic reaction to LSD.

398
00:37:24,687 --> 00:37:26,962
He can be trouble.

399
00:37:27,047 --> 00:37:29,163
So can I.

400
00:37:30,527 --> 00:37:34,236
- You travelling alone?
- Just one of him and one of me.

401
00:37:35,727 --> 00:37:37,718
All right, I'll release him.

402
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:43,644
Put your clothes on, Ringerman.
You're going on another trip.

403
00:37:43,727 --> 00:37:46,116
Give Pushie my regards, huh? OK?

404
00:37:47,207 --> 00:37:49,198
- OK.
- Yeah.

405
00:37:50,527 --> 00:37:52,961
Does more for me
than a kilo of grass, huh?

406
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:55,562
Put your pants on, boy.

407
00:38:39,327 --> 00:38:43,878
(PA) Will all passengers kindly
proceed to the boarding area. Thank you.

408
00:38:45,087 --> 00:38:47,840
Call for passenger Coogan
on housephone 1G.

409
00:38:52,287 --> 00:38:55,723
- Where are the housephones?
- Back there, sir.

410
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:09,600
- Coogan here.
- Wrong number.

411
00:39:27,287 --> 00:39:30,245
- Yeah, crazy baby.
- Kill him, Jimmy. Kill him, Jimmy.

412
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:32,758
Not here! Let's blow!

413
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:41,435
Green pants, hm?

414
00:39:43,407 --> 00:39:46,126
Green corduroy. Had a red sweater.

415
00:39:46,487 --> 00:39:48,603
He had a face?

416
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:50,917
I told you, he was behind me.

417
00:39:52,327 --> 00:39:54,158
Beautiful.

418
00:39:55,007 --> 00:39:58,079
Look, I was on my back
and that's all I saw.

419
00:40:00,527 --> 00:40:03,883
All right. From the top, let's start again.

420
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:08,006
From where you bluffed your way
into Ringerman's hospital room.

421
00:40:08,687 --> 00:40:10,917
I haven't left anything out.

422
00:40:11,207 --> 00:40:14,677
- Thing is, I don't know that for sure.
- I told you.

423
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:17,804
Come back in the morning.
The patient's in need of rest.

424
00:40:17,887 --> 00:40:21,084
- Just a couple more minutes, Doctor.
- All right.

425
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:23,601
Look, yesterday we had
a prisoner in custody.

426
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:27,396
Today we've got a fugitive wandering
around with your gun in his pocket.

427
00:40:27,487 --> 00:40:30,877
- Think about it.
- I have been.

428
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:33,083
We need your cooperation.

429
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:38,597
What you remember on the plane home
won't help us get Ringerman right now.

430
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:46,362
I'm not leaving without that prisoner.

431
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,439
Didn't that whack on the head
teach you anything?

432
00:40:49,527 --> 00:40:53,998
You're in a whole... another kind of
ball game. You're out of your league.

433
00:40:54,087 --> 00:40:57,124
We've got 28,000 cops in the city.
Leave Ringerman to us.

434
00:40:58,527 --> 00:41:00,882
Well, it's gettin' personal now.

435
00:41:01,607 --> 00:41:04,963
Yeah, a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

436
00:41:05,567 --> 00:41:09,037
- That it, Wyatt?
- That's one way of puttin' it, Lieutenant.

437
00:41:10,487 --> 00:41:13,399
Well, here's another: forget it.

438
00:41:13,487 --> 00:41:18,117
understand? That's not just me talking.
This is from the district attorney's office.

439
00:41:18,207 --> 00:41:22,359
You are not a policeman in the city
of New York. Am I getting through?

440
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:26,281
- I still carry a badge.
- In Arizona you're a deputy sheriff!

441
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:30,360
Here you're just another private citizen...
with a headache.

442
00:41:33,247 --> 00:41:36,398
- I'll be back tomorrow.
- Yeah, you do that.

443
00:43:13,767 --> 00:43:15,758
(buzzer)

444
00:43:18,247 --> 00:43:20,238
What do you want?

445
00:43:21,567 --> 00:43:24,161
- Ringerman?
- There's no such person here.

446
00:43:24,247 --> 00:43:27,319
- Police. Open up.
- I gotta see a warrant.

447
00:43:28,287 --> 00:43:30,357
All right! Will ya wait a minute?!

448
00:43:31,927 --> 00:43:33,918
(unlocks door)

449
00:43:38,567 --> 00:43:40,558
upstairs, 25.

450
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:56,358
Outta the way.

451
00:43:58,207 --> 00:44:00,198
(phone rings)

452
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,398
Yeah?

453
00:44:06,927 --> 00:44:08,918
Oh, yeah?

454
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:11,078
So it's the cops.

455
00:44:11,887 --> 00:44:13,878
Well, let 'em come.

456
00:44:22,847 --> 00:44:26,044
Well, well, well!
What have we got here?

457
00:44:26,487 --> 00:44:29,524
Buffalo Bill with the fancy hat!

458
00:44:30,607 --> 00:44:33,519
And look! Boots with the pointy toes.

459
00:44:34,127 --> 00:44:35,116
(chuckles)

460
00:44:35,207 --> 00:44:37,675
Very fancy.

461
00:44:40,607 --> 00:44:42,677
I'm not impressed.

462
00:44:43,367 --> 00:44:45,756
You Mrs Ringerman?

463
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:49,963
Come in. Come in, Mr Cowboy.

464
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:54,162
I got nothin' to hide.
I'm not even asking for a search warrant

465
00:44:54,247 --> 00:44:57,683
cos I got nothin' whatsoever
to hide from nobody.

466
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,122
Welcome to my palace.

467
00:45:05,207 --> 00:45:07,323
Course, the prince just happens to be out,

468
00:45:07,407 --> 00:45:10,399
but that's cos the police
are just hounding him.

469
00:45:12,007 --> 00:45:15,283
Well, you're very polite,

470
00:45:15,367 --> 00:45:17,358
with your fancy hat in your hand.

471
00:45:18,407 --> 00:45:21,638
At least you know how
to enter a lady's home, anyway.

472
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:26,480
Where is he, Mrs Ringerman?

473
00:45:26,567 --> 00:45:31,118
You outta your head? I should tell you
so you take him back to jail?

474
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:33,637
You're talkin' to his mother.

475
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:36,158
Let me show you somethin'.

476
00:45:38,167 --> 00:45:40,158
Just look what I got in here.

477
00:45:43,127 --> 00:45:44,924
Look at this.

478
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:48,966
Genuine sterling silver dinnerware.

479
00:45:49,047 --> 00:45:51,038
My son gave it to me.

480
00:45:51,607 --> 00:45:55,919
And look at this.
Hand-painted imported oil painting.

481
00:45:56,007 --> 00:45:59,761
Gifts! Gifts from a son to his mother.

482
00:45:59,847 --> 00:46:03,442
And look.
How many mothers do you know...

483
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:05,643
Just look at this.

484
00:46:05,727 --> 00:46:07,718
A fur coat he got for me.

485
00:46:09,127 --> 00:46:12,597
- How?
- How? He went to the store.

486
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:15,201
Was it open for business?

487
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:19,082
(tuts)

488
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:22,443
You try to be nice. So what do you get?

489
00:46:22,527 --> 00:46:24,518
Fancy remarks.

490
00:46:26,927 --> 00:46:30,636
Maybe you've been here
long enough, Mr Cowboy.

491
00:46:31,607 --> 00:46:35,202
Look, Mrs Ringerman,
I just wanna take him back for trial.

492
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:37,958
Oh, yeah?

493
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:42,756
I don't usually make no deals with cops.

494
00:46:43,487 --> 00:46:45,842
Be smart if you did.

495
00:46:46,767 --> 00:46:50,601
Smart? Smartness is one thing.

496
00:46:51,367 --> 00:46:53,244
Motherhood's another.

497
00:46:55,087 --> 00:46:56,156
Motherhood?

498
00:46:56,247 --> 00:47:01,002
That's what you're talkin' to,
Mr Cowboy: motherhood.

499
00:47:13,487 --> 00:47:17,560
- He does all right, doesn't he?
- 24 hours, the phone never stops.

500
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:23,676
- A nice motorcycle.
- Bought and paid for with his own money.

501
00:47:23,927 --> 00:47:26,077
You wanna see his owner's licence?

502
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,077
(Coogan) No.

503
00:47:30,287 --> 00:47:35,486
- Pretty.
- Yeah. Linny Raven. That's her name.

504
00:47:35,567 --> 00:47:37,876
A certified ding-dong.

505
00:47:42,287 --> 00:47:44,278
Raven, huh?

506
00:47:49,047 --> 00:47:51,322
OK, Mrs Ringerman.

507
00:47:51,407 --> 00:47:53,398
Thank you for the visit.

508
00:47:54,207 --> 00:47:56,084
Is that all?

509
00:47:56,167 --> 00:48:00,285
Hey, wait a minute! You think you
can come in here, write down a name

510
00:48:00,367 --> 00:48:03,245
and put on that fancy hat and just go?

511
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:05,318
You know what you are?

512
00:48:07,567 --> 00:48:09,046
Fancy.

513
00:48:09,127 --> 00:48:11,880
You smart-ass cowboy cop!

514
00:48:11,967 --> 00:48:14,686
I hope you break both legs!

515
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,240
- What's goin' on here?
- You're under arrest.

516
00:48:34,967 --> 00:48:37,800
- What's the charge?
- lmpersonating an officer.

517
00:49:02,807 --> 00:49:05,116
I wake up stinkin' like a goat.

518
00:49:05,207 --> 00:49:07,357
No bath. Couldn't even take a shave.

519
00:49:07,447 --> 00:49:09,039
Cockroaches.

520
00:49:09,127 --> 00:49:12,597
- And now because of you, for what?
- You've met Sergeant Wallace.

521
00:49:12,687 --> 00:49:15,884
Do you know what it means when
you've got a stakeout established

522
00:49:15,967 --> 00:49:20,006
and some rockhead walks in
and blows it... Oh, damn!

523
00:49:20,087 --> 00:49:22,555
Where do you come off, anyway?

524
00:49:22,647 --> 00:49:25,115
This isn't the OK Corral around here.

525
00:49:25,767 --> 00:49:28,440
This is the city of New York!
We've got a system!

526
00:49:28,567 --> 00:49:31,365
Not much, but we're fond of it.

527
00:49:31,447 --> 00:49:36,441
We don't like it when a two-for-a-nickel
cowboy tries to bend it out of shape.

528
00:49:36,527 --> 00:49:38,563
Are you chargin' me or what?

529
00:49:38,647 --> 00:49:40,638
You blew a stakeout!

530
00:49:41,647 --> 00:49:46,277
It involved a lot of time and trouble
and discomfort for Sergeant Wallace.

531
00:49:46,367 --> 00:49:48,164
You thought Ringerman'd go there?

532
00:49:48,247 --> 00:49:50,442
- It has happened.
- Not with him it wouldn't.

533
00:49:50,527 --> 00:49:53,121
Where does it say
you're an expert on Ringerman?

534
00:49:53,207 --> 00:49:57,917
I tracked him down for eight days. You
learn a lot about a person hunting him.

535
00:49:58,007 --> 00:50:01,363
- Like what?
- Like that he's not a fool, that's what.

536
00:50:01,567 --> 00:50:04,035
Then how in the hell did you collar him?

537
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:07,597
If you'd asked us about Mrs Ringerman,
we'd have told you she's a nut!

538
00:50:07,687 --> 00:50:10,042
There's no point
in going up there to see her.

539
00:50:10,127 --> 00:50:12,436
I wanted her out
so I could look the place over.

540
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:16,316
- She wasn't going anyplace.
- There's a good chance she would have.

541
00:50:16,407 --> 00:50:18,523
Why?

542
00:50:18,607 --> 00:50:22,805
The same way an animal leaves a nest
in another direction - to throw you off.

543
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:25,321
Well, what do you know! Woodcraft!

544
00:50:26,447 --> 00:50:28,517
It's the one merit badge I missed.

545
00:50:28,607 --> 00:50:31,167
That's too bad.
You might have learned something.

546
00:50:31,247 --> 00:50:32,805
About what?

547
00:50:32,887 --> 00:50:36,926
About animals. People. They don't act
much different when you're hunting 'em.

548
00:50:37,007 --> 00:50:38,998
Hold it.

549
00:50:39,767 --> 00:50:41,758
This came for you.

550
00:50:54,207 --> 00:50:56,198
Which makes it unanimous.

551
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:58,596
I took the liberty.

552
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:01,281
You're on flight number 73, TWA.

553
00:51:01,367 --> 00:51:03,642
Leaves at 4.15pm.

554
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,321
They'd like you there a half-hour earlier.

555
00:51:09,407 --> 00:51:11,204
I'll think about that.

556
00:51:11,287 --> 00:51:13,596
Coogan.

557
00:51:13,687 --> 00:51:16,281
I'm through messin' around with you.

558
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:20,360
Obstructing justice is a one-to-five felony.
Forget Ringerman.

559
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:24,643
If I even suspect you're nosin' around
between now and plane time,

560
00:51:24,727 --> 00:51:28,436
I'll throw you in the can so fast,
it'll make your nose bleed!

561
00:51:36,847 --> 00:51:39,839
- What happened in there?
- Nothin' much.

562
00:51:39,927 --> 00:51:43,124
Didn't you get taken off
the Ringerman case?

563
00:51:43,207 --> 00:51:45,846
News travels fast
around here, doesn't it?

564
00:51:45,927 --> 00:51:48,680
(Julie) I was in the room
when McElroy called Arizona.

565
00:51:48,767 --> 00:51:52,885
Yeah, old Sheriff McCrea must have
really enjoyed that phone call.

566
00:51:52,967 --> 00:51:54,878
He doesn't like you?

567
00:51:54,967 --> 00:51:56,958
Oh, he likes me some of the time.

568
00:51:58,647 --> 00:52:01,036
- Most of the time not.
- Why?

569
00:52:02,847 --> 00:52:06,726
He looks at me, he sees a man
who's gonna take his job some day.

570
00:52:07,847 --> 00:52:09,758
I believe it.

571
00:52:09,847 --> 00:52:13,283
There's the Cloisters.
Would you like to go through it?

572
00:52:21,047 --> 00:52:23,561
"No, thank you, Julie. Some other time."

573
00:52:28,527 --> 00:52:30,916
I'm trying to picture it the way it was.

574
00:52:31,847 --> 00:52:35,681
Just the trees and the river, before
people came along and fouled it all up.

575
00:52:35,807 --> 00:52:39,516
(Julie) Thinking "He's out there
somewhere" - Ringerman, your prey?

576
00:52:39,727 --> 00:52:41,718
- Right.
- Mm-hm.

577
00:52:41,847 --> 00:52:43,838
Can I tell you something else?

578
00:52:45,127 --> 00:52:47,038
McElroy wasn't just kidding.

579
00:52:47,127 --> 00:52:50,085
He said he'd throw you in jail
and he meant it.

580
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,364
Well, he's just trying to protect you.
Can't you see that?

581
00:52:53,447 --> 00:52:57,360
That's Ringerman's home court out there
and you don't even know the rules.

582
00:52:57,687 --> 00:52:59,484
So...

583
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:03,082
do yourself a favour and...
stop thinking about him.

584
00:53:04,367 --> 00:53:07,359
- I wasn't.
- Oh? What, then?

585
00:53:09,087 --> 00:53:10,884
Worms.

586
00:53:10,967 --> 00:53:13,959
Little green kind of ones
that glow in the dark.

587
00:53:18,127 --> 00:53:20,766
- Green worms?
- Yeah. Green.

588
00:53:23,207 --> 00:53:25,357
You are so enigmatic.

589
00:53:25,447 --> 00:53:27,438
Enig-what?

590
00:53:29,127 --> 00:53:31,800
It's a word that keeps coming to mind.

591
00:53:31,887 --> 00:53:34,003
Except it's a phoney.

592
00:53:34,087 --> 00:53:36,203
It is, huh?

593
00:53:38,007 --> 00:53:40,680
There has to be something
more to you besides...

594
00:53:40,767 --> 00:53:43,281
What?

595
00:53:43,367 --> 00:53:46,996
I dunno. Love. Compassion.

596
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:50,162
Humanity. Capacity for pity.

597
00:53:51,007 --> 00:53:53,316
- Pity?
- Mm. You must have heard of it.

598
00:53:53,407 --> 00:53:56,399
Yeah. What colour is it?

599
00:53:57,087 --> 00:53:58,918
It's no colour!

600
00:53:59,007 --> 00:54:01,475
See? You don't know
what you're talkin' about.

601
00:54:01,567 --> 00:54:04,445
I don't know what you're
talking about, that's for sure.

602
00:54:04,527 --> 00:54:07,678
Well, the colour of pity is red.

603
00:54:08,527 --> 00:54:12,440
- Really? Hm.
- Oh, I've seen some once.

604
00:54:12,527 --> 00:54:15,360
- Where?
- It doesn't make any difference.

605
00:54:17,207 --> 00:54:19,596
Oh, I give up on you.
I'm looking for a key.

606
00:54:19,687 --> 00:54:22,121
Lots of luck. I can't even find the door.

607
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:25,122
Well...

608
00:54:25,207 --> 00:54:27,801
It was a bus station in Prescott, Arizona.

609
00:54:28,967 --> 00:54:30,958
It was all over the floor, pity.

610
00:54:34,207 --> 00:54:36,880
This guy felt sorry
for a prisoner he was takin' in.

611
00:54:36,967 --> 00:54:39,037
He let him say goodbye to his wife.

612
00:54:40,327 --> 00:54:43,524
He ended up with
a six-inch blade in his gut.

613
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:46,760
The wife had it up her sleeve.
So much for pity.

614
00:54:48,487 --> 00:54:50,478
Who was it?

615
00:54:51,807 --> 00:54:55,880
Aren't we gonna have a spaghetti dinner,
or was that just talk?

616
00:54:55,967 --> 00:54:57,958
It was you, wasn't it?

617
00:55:00,687 --> 00:55:02,678
I'm really ready for spaghetti.

618
00:55:04,327 --> 00:55:07,239
OK. And thank you.

619
00:55:07,327 --> 00:55:09,318
For what?

620
00:55:11,487 --> 00:55:13,478
Just... thank you.

621
00:55:40,407 --> 00:55:43,524
I'll say this. Once you find
a subject that interests you,

622
00:55:43,607 --> 00:55:45,598
you certainly keep after it.

623
00:55:47,487 --> 00:55:49,478
Why not?

624
00:55:50,687 --> 00:55:52,996
I think we better change the subject.

625
00:55:56,967 --> 00:55:58,958
All righty.

626
00:55:59,967 --> 00:56:02,481
Do you know a girl named Linny Raven?

627
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:05,445
Yes, I'm her probation officer. Why?

628
00:56:05,527 --> 00:56:07,518
I'm just curious, that's all.

629
00:56:08,367 --> 00:56:11,677
That's privileged information,
Coogan. You know that.

630
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:14,804
You were the one
who wanted to change the subject.

631
00:56:28,567 --> 00:56:30,558
Tell me about Arizona.

632
00:56:31,527 --> 00:56:33,757
Why don't you come see for yourself?

633
00:56:35,727 --> 00:56:38,924
- Is that an invitation?
- Now, what's it sound like?

634
00:56:43,727 --> 00:56:45,718
Here, I'll give you a hand.

635
00:56:51,127 --> 00:56:54,085
- I just got a picture of that.
- What?

636
00:56:54,167 --> 00:56:58,479
Me galloping up to the old corral
with my sleeping bag.

637
00:57:05,007 --> 00:57:06,998
You might be surprised.

638
00:57:09,007 --> 00:57:10,440
Hm?

639
00:57:11,527 --> 00:57:13,438
At what?

640
00:57:13,527 --> 00:57:16,485
At Arizona. It's part of the union now.

641
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:18,762
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

642
00:57:20,207 --> 00:57:23,199
Electricity, indoor plumbing, TV -
all that.

643
00:57:24,367 --> 00:57:28,997
You wouldn't even have to bring
a sleeping bag. I got all the conveniences.

644
00:57:33,727 --> 00:57:35,638
And girls?

645
00:57:35,727 --> 00:57:39,640
Yeah, you might see
a stray one of those floatin' around.

646
00:57:39,727 --> 00:57:42,195
I mean you. Girlfriends.

647
00:57:42,287 --> 00:57:44,323
I never took a census. Why?

648
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:49,720
I don't know. I just judged you to be
rather busy in that area.

649
00:57:49,807 --> 00:57:51,684
- You did?
- Mm.

650
00:57:51,887 --> 00:57:55,880
- How about you with men?
- I don't need a census. I can count them.

651
00:57:56,407 --> 00:57:57,965
You can?

652
00:58:00,327 --> 00:58:02,761
How did we get back on this subject?

653
00:58:06,127 --> 00:58:09,085
It wasn't easy. Just fate.

654
00:58:15,447 --> 00:58:18,405
- I think you may be right.
- usually am.

655
00:58:18,487 --> 00:58:20,478
- Are you?
- Mm-hm.

656
00:58:27,447 --> 00:58:29,438
Dinner.

657
00:58:33,807 --> 00:58:35,798
Still running?

658
00:58:37,807 --> 00:58:41,516
A good spaghetti sauce
should simmer for about three hours.

659
00:58:41,607 --> 00:58:43,598
Mmm.

in your whole body, you'd...

685
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:18,644
Hey, hey, big man!

686
01:02:22,407 --> 01:02:24,398
Ooooh!

687
01:02:25,247 --> 01:02:28,125
Ooh, looking for anyone special?

688
01:02:29,127 --> 01:02:33,120
- Linny Raven. Is she around?
- If you're willing to settle for second best.

689
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:35,323
Nirvana City, back room.

690
01:02:57,327 --> 01:03:03,926
' I say love is a pigeon-toed orange peel

691
01:03:04,367 --> 01:03:06,358
' A pigeon-toed orange peel

692
01:03:08,887 --> 01:03:11,003
' No more, no less

693
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:13,965
' A pigeon-toed orange peel

694
01:03:14,247 --> 01:03:17,000
' Pigeon-toed orange peel

695
01:03:18,727 --> 01:03:21,958
' And it's real, love is real

696
01:03:36,127 --> 01:03:40,245
' Are you lookin' straight at me
to see a sign of love?

697
01:03:42,327 --> 01:03:46,605
' Are you lookin' straight at me

698
01:03:48,927 --> 01:03:52,203
' Are you reachin' out to me

701
01:04:07,967 --> 01:04:09,958
There you go, baby.

702
01:04:13,207 --> 01:04:15,926
- Linny.
- Who is your friend?

703
01:04:16,007 --> 01:04:19,682
This is Wonderful Digby
and this is Omega.

704
01:04:20,487 --> 01:04:22,557
I'm Coogan. Been lookin' for you.

705
01:04:22,647 --> 01:04:25,241
Yeah, wild.
But we were just about to split.

706
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:29,997
um...

707
01:04:30,087 --> 01:04:32,885
- I wanna talk to you.
- Hey, Charlie.

708
01:04:33,567 --> 01:04:35,558
Coogan.

709
01:04:35,967 --> 01:04:37,719
Coogan.

710
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:41,197
112 Ellwood Street. Way up on the top.

711
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:45,397
Yeah, I was already up there.
They told me you were down here.

712
01:04:45,487 --> 01:04:47,921
Well, try again.

713
01:04:48,007 --> 01:04:49,998
And wear your boots, cowboy.

714
01:04:51,647 --> 01:04:54,366
- I'm wearin' 'em right now.
- So you are.

715
01:04:54,447 --> 01:04:56,438
Hey, Charlie.

716
01:04:57,207 --> 01:05:01,485
- It's still Coogan.
- It's Charlie.

717
01:05:01,567 --> 01:05:04,639
As in "Goodbye, Charlie."

718
01:05:06,447 --> 01:05:10,884
As in "Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home."

719
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:14,360
Look, friends. We wanna be alone.

720
01:05:15,087 --> 01:05:20,957
- uh-uh. Go away, Charlie.
- Yeah, while your legs still work.

721
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:31,883
All right, now. I don't like violence,
Mr Wonderful... whatever your name is.

722
01:05:32,207 --> 01:05:35,995
You better drop that blade
or you won't believe what happens next,

723
01:05:36,607 --> 01:05:39,565
even while it's happenin'.

724
01:05:42,847 --> 01:05:45,202
The blade.

725
01:05:48,247 --> 01:05:50,636
It's dropped.

726
01:06:22,207 --> 01:06:24,277
Would you have?

727
01:06:24,367 --> 01:06:26,961
Would I have what?

728
01:06:27,047 --> 01:06:29,436
With the broken bottle?

729
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,518
Gouged him?

730
01:06:37,607 --> 01:06:39,199
Hm?

731
01:06:39,967 --> 01:06:41,958
I don't know. That was up to him.

732
01:06:50,887 --> 01:06:52,764
Good heavens!

733
01:06:52,847 --> 01:06:54,803
How's everything in Australia?

734
01:07:03,247 --> 01:07:06,205
What do you want? Hm?

735
01:07:09,327 --> 01:07:11,966
Cat got your tongue?

736
01:07:12,847 --> 01:07:14,121
No.

737
01:07:16,487 --> 01:07:18,478
Joe Straight.

738
01:07:22,847 --> 01:07:24,883
What's your bag, Joe?

739
01:07:24,967 --> 01:07:26,958
Music? Hm?

740
01:07:35,247 --> 01:07:37,477
(' sitar and tablas)

741
01:07:37,567 --> 01:07:39,558
No?

742
01:07:42,847 --> 01:07:45,122
Grass, hm?

743
01:07:45,207 --> 01:07:47,596
Dig grass? Hm?

744
01:08:00,207 --> 01:08:02,767
Juice. Hm?

745
01:08:02,847 --> 01:08:04,838
A drinking man.

746
01:08:05,647 --> 01:08:07,638
Occasionally.

747
01:08:22,607 --> 01:08:24,598
Why me, Mr Cowboy?

748
01:08:26,487 --> 01:08:29,126
Cos I liked what I saw in the hospital.

749
01:08:29,207 --> 01:08:31,198
So did I.

750
01:08:35,127 --> 01:08:38,881
It's what happened afterwards
that I didn't care for too much.

751
01:08:38,967 --> 01:08:41,561
What are you talking about?

752
01:08:43,447 --> 01:08:48,043
Something about getting sapped
on the head has a weird effect on me.

753
01:08:48,127 --> 01:08:50,357
- What's sapped?
- You know.

754
01:08:50,447 --> 01:08:51,960
Mm-mm.

755
01:08:52,047 --> 01:08:54,038
Liar.

756
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:59,200
- I'd never lie to cowboys.
- You wouldn't, huh?

757
01:09:01,407 --> 01:09:04,001
Do me a favour.

758
01:09:04,087 --> 01:09:07,284
Tell me where Ringerman is.
I just wanna talk to him.

759
01:09:08,047 --> 01:09:10,515
- You want Jimmy?
- Mm-hm.

760
01:09:10,607 --> 01:09:12,598
I know where he is.

761
01:09:14,527 --> 01:09:16,518
Later.

762
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:21,279
Come on, shoot.
You gonna take all night?

763
01:10:24,487 --> 01:10:26,717
Ha-ha! Great shot!

764
01:10:26,807 --> 01:10:28,798
(door opens)

765
01:10:49,127 --> 01:10:51,516
He's looking for Jimmy Ringerman.

766
01:11:05,607 --> 01:11:09,600
Pushie. He hasn't got a gun.

767
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:22,523
Looking for Jimbo, eh?

768
01:11:25,567 --> 01:11:26,636
Yeah.

769
01:11:39,927 --> 01:11:41,918
You lost?

770
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:47,876
Shouldn't leave your horse, cowboy.

771
01:12:49,927 --> 01:12:51,918
- Cool it, cool it.
- (siren wails)

772
01:12:52,927 --> 01:12:55,680
Come on, come on. Let's get out of here.

773
01:13:05,407 --> 01:13:07,398
(siren gets closer)

774
01:13:18,167 --> 01:13:19,566
(Coogan groans)

775
01:13:37,687 --> 01:13:39,405
Where's Ringerman?

776
01:13:39,847 --> 01:13:42,042
Where's Ringerman?

777
01:13:45,927 --> 01:13:48,361
(siren gets closer)

778
01:14:00,407 --> 01:14:02,398
(siren stops)

779
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,882
(hurried footsteps)

780
01:14:22,367 --> 01:14:24,358
(car brakes violently)

781
01:14:39,967 --> 01:14:41,958
(moaning)

782
01:15:03,767 --> 01:15:05,962
(groans)

783
01:15:06,047 --> 01:15:08,038
(banging at door)

784
01:15:12,047 --> 01:15:14,038
(banging continues)

785
01:15:19,207 --> 01:15:21,198
You bastard.

786
01:15:21,967 --> 01:15:24,959
Have you any idea
of the damage you've done?

787
01:15:25,047 --> 01:15:27,083
I'm talking about Linny Raven.

788
01:15:27,487 --> 01:15:31,400
I just got her out of jail.
She was picked up near that pool room.

789
01:15:31,487 --> 01:15:34,365
Do you know what that means?
Violation of parole.

790
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:38,042
So thanks to you, Mr Coogan,
she will finish her sentence.

791
01:15:38,847 --> 01:15:41,725
And... on the way back to her place,

792
01:15:41,807 --> 01:15:43,798
she and I had a long talk.

793
01:15:44,807 --> 01:15:47,241
She's a painfully graphic little girl.

794
01:15:48,287 --> 01:15:51,120
She gave me a play-by-play
description of...

795
01:15:51,927 --> 01:15:55,363
how you slept with her, boots and...

796
01:15:55,447 --> 01:16:00,157
You came here at four o'clock
in the morning just to tell me all this?

797
01:16:01,207 --> 01:16:03,198
I...

798
01:16:04,287 --> 01:16:06,960
I thought I saw something in you. I...

799
01:16:07,047 --> 01:16:09,607
(man) Shut up down there!

800
01:16:17,327 --> 01:16:21,923
All this talk about Linny Raven.
Is that really why you're so mad?

801
01:17:02,487 --> 01:17:04,876
- You're takin' me to Ringerman.
- No!

802
01:19:07,167 --> 01:19:09,237
Keep goin'.

803
01:19:10,487 --> 01:19:13,081
I'll be right behind you.

804
01:20:21,727 --> 01:20:25,436
Jimmy! Jimmy!

805
01:20:27,687 --> 01:20:30,247
Jimmy!

806
01:20:31,447 --> 01:20:34,723
Jimmy! Jimmy!

807
01:20:35,407 --> 01:20:38,604
- What the hell are you doin' here?
- I brought him here. I had to.

808
01:20:38,687 --> 01:20:41,281
You shoulda seen him!
He was gonna bust my face open!

809
01:20:41,367 --> 01:20:43,278
- Who'd you bring here?
- The cowboy.

810
01:20:43,367 --> 01:20:45,801
He was right behind me
and now he's gone.

811
01:20:51,207 --> 01:20:53,880
What'd you bring him here for?
You stupid freak!

812
01:20:53,967 --> 01:20:55,958
Ringerman!

813
01:21:02,527 --> 01:21:04,518
Ringerman!

814
01:21:08,007 --> 01:21:09,918
Hey! Ringerman!

815
01:21:11,687 --> 01:21:12,961
(clicks)

816
01:21:29,607 --> 01:21:31,757
Jimmy! Jimmy!

817
01:21:34,087 --> 01:21:35,759
Jimmy!

818
01:21:36,287 --> 01:21:38,437
Jimmy!

819
01:21:38,527 --> 01:21:41,439
Jimmy!

820
01:21:54,967 --> 01:21:58,437
Come on, you son of a bitch. Come on!

821
01:21:59,727 --> 01:22:02,002
You damn fool!

822
01:22:11,007 --> 01:22:12,998
Hey!

823
01:22:13,847 --> 01:22:16,202
Where the hell are you goin'
with my bike?

824
01:22:16,287 --> 01:22:17,606
Hey!

825
01:22:17,687 --> 01:22:21,043
Hey, come back with my bike!
Where are you goin'?

826
01:26:19,447 --> 01:26:21,483
I'm makin' a citizen's arrest.

827
01:26:23,767 --> 01:26:25,758
Take him back to Bellevue.

828
01:26:34,567 --> 01:26:36,922
I'm gettin' too old for these police cars.

829
01:26:37,487 --> 01:26:39,478
When do I get him?

830
01:26:41,487 --> 01:26:46,038
First you go to the DA's office,
then the state supreme court.

831
01:26:46,127 --> 01:26:50,518
Then you don't lay a glove on him
until he's officially released by Bellevue.

832
01:26:50,607 --> 01:26:52,677
Now, is that all right with you?

833
01:26:59,607 --> 01:27:03,839
Yeah. That's all right with me, Lieutenant.

834
01:27:25,647 --> 01:27:27,638
Much obliged.

835
01:27:29,527 --> 01:27:31,518
Come on.

836
01:27:36,807 --> 01:27:38,798
Lieutenant.

837
01:27:39,967 --> 01:27:42,765
- Sheriff.
- Thanks.

838
01:27:45,327 --> 01:27:47,318
My regards to Tex... uh...

839
01:27:48,487 --> 01:27:50,478
Arizona.
