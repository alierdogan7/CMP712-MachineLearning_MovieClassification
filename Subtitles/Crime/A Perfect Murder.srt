1
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:41,789
There you are!

2
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:45,906
How was your day?
Any progress in saving the world?

3
00:02:46,196 --> 00:02:47,709
I'm working on it.

4
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:51,553
You changed your mind about tonight?

5
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:54,475
Not really. Told you
I didn't want to miss it.

6
00:02:55,036 --> 00:02:56,947
What happened with that dinner
with the London people?

7
00:02:57,236 --> 00:02:59,704
-You made it sound so unavoidable.
-It was.

8
00:03:00,156 --> 00:03:01,748
Fortunately, they missed their plane.

9
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:06,589
Here's to. . .

10
00:03:06,796 --> 00:03:08,548
. . .stolen moments.

11
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:17,992
You look so handsome,
I better see if I can catch up.

12
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:40,712
Nobody home?

13
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:44,626
I left some Security Council
transcripts out, but everybody's gone.

14
00:03:45,396 --> 00:03:47,273
Anything earth-shattering?

15
00:03:47,596 --> 00:03:51,191
No, it's just important enough
not to be left out.

16
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:54,434
You look incredible.

17
00:03:55,476 --> 00:03:57,194
Yeah, but we have to hurry.

18
00:04:12,596 --> 00:04:13,824
I prefer this one.

19
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:18,631
Right.

20
00:04:45,436 --> 00:04:47,233
Can I have a picture, please?

21
00:04:47,436 --> 00:04:49,188
This way. This way, please.

22
00:04:58,476 --> 00:05:01,149
There's Andrew. Good to see him.
Robynn, hi.

23
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:02,949
Steven, how are you?

24
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,669
Nice to see you.
Emily, you look wonderful.

25
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:06,184
Keep up the good work.

26
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:09,394
That's Steven Taylor
and his wife, Emily.

27
00:05:10,236 --> 00:05:11,271
Well, at last!

28
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:13,148
The beautiful people have arrived.

29
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,590
Fantastic dress!

30
00:05:15,396 --> 00:05:16,192
Thank you.

31
00:05:16,956 --> 00:05:19,311
I didn't expect to see you tonight,
with Greenspan and all.

32
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:20,432
Why's that?

33
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:22,473
I thought you'd be
up to your ass in alligators.

34
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:25,992
Rumors of my death have been
greatly exaggerated.

35
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:28,507
All I need is her phone number.

36
00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:30,986
Absolutely.
I must see about something.

37
00:05:31,236 --> 00:05:33,033
Lovely!
Thank you, darling.

38
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:36,953
The temple's hieroglyphics
are supplications. . .

39
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:38,345
. . .to the gods of fertility.

40
00:05:38,636 --> 00:05:40,513
I do believe I know his work.

41
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:44,112
Perhaps we could come along
to your studio one day.

42
00:06:11,716 --> 00:06:12,865
You said he wasn't coming.

43
00:06:13,116 --> 00:06:15,550
He changed his mind.
I tried to call you.

44
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:17,794
What are we going to do?

45
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:21,385
Nothing. Just relax.

46
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:24,664
-He doesn't know who I am, right?
-No.

47
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:27,994
You're a peach.

48
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:30,588
Lunch tomorrow?

49
00:06:31,276 --> 00:06:32,789
And tomorrow. . .

50
00:06:32,996 --> 00:06:34,429
. . .and tomorrow.

51
00:06:35,076 --> 00:06:38,671
I leave you alone for 30 seconds
and you elope with a younger man.

52
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,794
Steven, I'd like to
introduce you to David Shaw.

53
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:43,435
Pleasure! Nice to meet you.

54
00:06:43,676 --> 00:06:44,711
David is a painter.

55
00:06:44,996 --> 00:06:48,193
I saw some of his pieces downtown.
I thought they were amazing.

56
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:50,990
What brings you uptown to our
little inbred soirée?

57
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:54,786
Actually, Emily was kind enough
to wrangle me an invite.

58
00:06:55,036 --> 00:06:56,264
Me too.

59
00:06:58,396 --> 00:07:00,273
So tell me about your work. . .

60
00:07:00,556 --> 00:07:01,545
. . .David?

61
00:07:01,836 --> 00:07:04,066
A couple small galleries
carry me when there's space.

62
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:07,314
-You studied formally?
-Berkeley, Cal Arts.

63
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:10,024
Almost formally graduated too.

64
00:07:11,276 --> 00:07:12,868
Too much study pollutes the soul.

65
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:15,112
-And he's good?
-He's wonderful.

66
00:07:15,356 --> 00:07:18,553
I'd love to see your pieces.
Maybe we can arrange a time.

67
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:21,629
-Whenever you want.
-Emily has your number?

68
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:26,153
No. The gallery can get ahold of me.
You know which one?

69
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:28,635
Yes.

70
00:07:29,436 --> 00:07:30,949
If you're as good as she says. . .

71
00:07:31,196 --> 00:07:33,790
. . .I'll pass the word on
to my acquisitive friends.

72
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:36,869
Thanks. That's very generous.

73
00:07:37,436 --> 00:07:38,585
Nice to meet you.

74
00:07:39,196 --> 00:07:40,265
You too.

75
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:41,989
Pleasure to see you.

76
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:05,148
We cannot be held accountable...

77
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:08,553
...for the actions of others
that require us to defend ourselves.

78
00:08:13,316 --> 00:08:14,510
Madame Ambassador.

79
00:08:15,316 --> 00:08:19,275
It's the same speech he gave in
Geneva 3 months ago, word for word.

80
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,149
Showoff.

81
00:08:27,036 --> 00:08:29,391
-Good morning, how are you?
-Fine, thank you.

82
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,270
Steven, spreads are blowing out.

83
00:08:32,556 --> 00:08:35,673
The way things look in Europe,
it could turn into a bloodbath.

84
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:39,551
-So what are we talking?
-At least 1 50 basis points.

85
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:41,269
The Bundesbank will have to tag along.

86
00:08:41,516 --> 00:08:44,235
Your yen and mark positions
will get hammered.

87
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:46,109
So what's our exposure?

88
00:08:46,356 --> 00:08:48,108
Based on my preliminary trend model?

89
00:08:48,356 --> 00:08:49,675
Yes. No frills.

90
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,668
Think Chernobyl.

91
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:03,586
Greenpoint, next stop.

92
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,345
What you got there?

93
00:09:29,596 --> 00:09:31,188
It's a little surprise.

94
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:33,189
Come on up.

95
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:39,589
Here's your fortune.

96
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:44,949
"You have a deep interest
in all that is artistic. "

97
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,030
It's true.

98
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,387
You didn't have to get this for me.

99
00:09:52,756 --> 00:09:55,224
You need a little civilizing.

100
00:09:58,276 --> 00:09:59,789
What do you need?

101
00:10:04,116 --> 00:10:05,595
What do you need?

102
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:15,388
You know, we could be in Belize
this time tomorrow.

103
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:17,515
Belize.

104
00:10:17,956 --> 00:10:19,708
You ever been there?

105
00:10:20,756 --> 00:10:23,031
You'd think you'd died
and went to heaven.

106
00:10:23,276 --> 00:10:25,187
But I already think that.

107
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:38,392
You look so pretty today.

108
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:51,752
Hey, it's David. Leave one.
I'll get back to you.

109
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:56,432
David, hi. It's Steven Taylor.
I'm finishing a little early today.

110
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:59,509
I thought I might come by
and check out your work.

111
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:01,667
Say about six.

112
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:07,226
If that flies with you, call me
at my office here at 5-4-4-...

113
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,194
... 1-8- 1-7.

114
00:12:10,636 --> 00:12:12,752
I look forward to seeing you.

115
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:17,467
What are you going to do?

116
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:21,992
I guess I'll call him.

117
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:25,465
Be kind of weird if I didn't,
wouldn't it?

118
00:12:26,076 --> 00:12:28,385
You're playing with fire, David.

119
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:34,193
If you're so upset about it,
why'd you give him my number?

120
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:37,028
I didn't.

121
00:12:56,636 --> 00:12:57,989
Mr. Taylor?

122
00:12:58,836 --> 00:13:00,349
Hi. Here, sit down.

123
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:04,466
That was stupid. Sorry about that.

124
00:13:07,956 --> 00:13:09,514
Thanks very much.

125
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,186
Drink?

126
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:13,394
No, I'm okay.

127
00:13:13,636 --> 00:13:15,467
Unless you want another one.

128
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,264
I just had us meet here
because my place is hard to find.

129
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:20,308
Like an illegal loft space?

130
00:13:21,756 --> 00:13:23,155
That's one way to put it.

131
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:27,187
I feel like I'm knee-deep
in bohemian cachet.

132
00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:28,750
Lead on.

133
00:13:38,836 --> 00:13:41,509
-How's Emily?
-She's fine, thank you.

134
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,867
Well, be sure and say "hi. "

135
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,435
I will.

136
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:50,984
One more.
One more floor.

137
00:13:51,276 --> 00:13:53,744
Building's over 1 00 years old now.

138
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:00,189
Watch your step.

139
00:14:17,076 --> 00:14:20,034
I can certainly see
what Emily was drawn to.

140
00:14:20,516 --> 00:14:21,790
Yeah? What's that?

141
00:14:22,516 --> 00:14:24,108
Your work. It's. . .

142
00:14:24,436 --> 00:14:26,313
. . .very trashy. . .

143
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:27,826
. . .but potent.

144
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:29,151
Trashy?

145
00:14:29,556 --> 00:14:30,989
Is that what she said?

146
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:37,315
Your anger. . .

147
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:39,595
. . .it's very controlled.

148
00:14:40,276 --> 00:14:41,834
You think I'm angry?

149
00:14:43,236 --> 00:14:45,113
The anger in your work.

150
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:47,866
The color of despair.

151
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,787
Wonder where that comes from.

152
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:53,389
I don't know.

153
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:55,554
Inside, I guess.

154
00:14:55,836 --> 00:14:56,825
Inside. . .

155
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:58,191
. . .indeed.

156
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:03,705
Nowhere to sit but the goddamned bed.

157
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:15,113
You know, I envy you.

158
00:15:15,596 --> 00:15:16,824
You envy me?

159
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:18,429
You should be. . .

160
00:15:18,716 --> 00:15:21,184
. . .flattered.
I'm not prone to envy.

161
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:24,155
It's a pathetic emotion.

162
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:27,711
Sneaks up on you like cancer.

163
00:15:27,956 --> 00:15:29,548
I've got it and you know why.

164
00:15:32,196 --> 00:15:32,912
No.

165
00:15:33,156 --> 00:15:34,794
Oh, of course you do.

166
00:15:35,956 --> 00:15:40,427
One of life's legitimately
sublime experiences. It's so. . .

167
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:42,874
. . .utterly complete.

168
00:15:43,156 --> 00:15:43,986
What?

169
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:46,787
Fucking my wife.

170
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:51,388
Mr. Taylor, I don't know--

171
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:54,548
I think it's about time
you called me Steven.

172
00:15:58,036 --> 00:15:59,594
We're in love, sir.

173
00:16:01,356 --> 00:16:02,789
That's it?

174
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:04,985
That's it?

175
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:09,152
You steal the crown jewel
of a man's soul. . .

176
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:13,509
. . .and your only excuse is some
candy-ass Hallmark card sentiment?

177
00:16:13,796 --> 00:16:15,866
Even if it was true,
that's not good enough!

178
00:16:16,796 --> 00:16:18,195
If what were true?

179
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,755
She is in love.

180
00:16:20,036 --> 00:16:20,991
You, buddy. . .

181
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:22,504
. . .you're in business.

182
00:16:22,756 --> 00:16:23,905
What the hell are you saying?

183
00:16:24,156 --> 00:16:27,228
I'm saying you did not meet
my wife by chance.

184
00:16:28,116 --> 00:16:30,710
I'm saying
you didn't study at Berkeley.

185
00:16:33,556 --> 00:16:37,993
I'm saying you learned to paint while
doing 3 to 6 in Soledad Prison. . .

186
00:16:38,236 --> 00:16:42,388
. . .for relieving a widow
in San Francisco of her life savings.

187
00:16:42,676 --> 00:16:43,870
Your second conviction. . .

188
00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:46,473
. . .if I'm not mistaken.

189
00:16:48,796 --> 00:16:52,345
Your real name is Winston Lagrange,
which I rather like.

190
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,594
Born to pure trailer trash
in Barstow, California.

191
00:16:55,836 --> 00:16:57,747
Ward of the courts
since the age of ten.

192
00:16:57,996 --> 00:17:01,625
You went from pickpocket to car thief
to con man till you found out. . .

193
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:04,595
. . .that you had a way
with the softer sex.

194
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:08,388
No doubt looking for that mother
you can barely remember.

195
00:17:09,276 --> 00:17:12,552
A life made up completely
of depressing little scams. . .

196
00:17:12,796 --> 00:17:13,672
. . .until now.

197
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,395
Where'd you get all that?

198
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:18,594
All that is for sale.
The hell of it is, you're not. . .

199
00:17:18,876 --> 00:17:20,992
. . .half-bad with a brush.

200
00:17:21,676 --> 00:17:23,234
Called rehabilitation.

201
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:25,945
It's called a con.
My wife's the grand prize.

202
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:28,750
But you set your sights
too high this time.

203
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:30,954
She loves me.

204
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,988
She loves David Shaw,
your invention.

205
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:36,825
But you've made
a fundamental miscalculation.

206
00:17:37,116 --> 00:17:38,231
Play it out.

207
00:17:38,596 --> 00:17:40,029
Love conquers all.

208
00:17:40,316 --> 00:17:42,910
Emily divorces me.
She marries you.

209
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:48,994
Given your history, her advisors
are going to insist upon a prenup.

210
00:17:49,996 --> 00:17:51,554
You might storm the castle. . .

211
00:17:51,796 --> 00:17:54,674
. . .but you ain't getting the keys
to the treasure room, ever.

212
00:17:54,956 --> 00:17:56,230
I don't care about that.

213
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:59,986
The swindler doesn't care about a
trust fund that can buy Barstow?

214
00:18:00,276 --> 00:18:01,834
Why don't you cut the shit!

215
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:04,988
You care, or we would not be having
this conversation!

216
00:18:05,956 --> 00:18:10,108
The only thing that stops you from
bolting now is bad genes and greed.

217
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:15,070
Now what?

218
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,315
Choices.

219
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:21,352
I can tell Emily who you are,
and life will imitate art.

220
00:18:21,556 --> 00:18:23,387
You become a starving painter,
game over.

221
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:26,105
Or?

222
00:18:27,076 --> 00:18:28,953
Or you can cash out.

223
00:18:29,636 --> 00:18:31,035
Cash out?

224
00:18:31,316 --> 00:18:32,749
Half a million dollars.

225
00:18:33,516 --> 00:18:34,995
Tax-free.

226
00:18:38,556 --> 00:18:40,786
Just for walking away from her?

227
00:18:41,356 --> 00:18:43,790
I said tax-free.
I didn't say free.

228
00:18:46,196 --> 00:18:48,027
What's 500 grand for?

229
00:18:49,676 --> 00:18:51,667
Killing my wife.

230
00:18:59,956 --> 00:19:01,071
Emily?

231
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:04,110
Imagine my embarrassment
if they're not the same.

232
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:06,312
$1 00,000 now. . .

233
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:09,429
. . . $400,000 after, cash-and-carry.

234
00:19:16,076 --> 00:19:17,748
You're out of your mind.

235
00:19:18,476 --> 00:19:20,034
Not really.

236
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:22,472
Why?

237
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:27,787
I appreciate your curiosity,
but my agenda doesn't concern you.

238
00:19:29,956 --> 00:19:32,754
I'll go straight to Emily
and tell her all this.

239
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:37,067
That would be my word against yours. . .

240
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:38,391
. . .Winston.

241
00:19:38,716 --> 00:19:40,547
And what if I call the cops?

242
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:47,185
Have you ever been
to Boca Raton, Florida?

243
00:19:50,116 --> 00:19:54,075
A lady there was carrying on
with a younger man.

244
00:19:54,356 --> 00:19:58,065
He was a hell of a tennis player.
When the affair ended. . .

245
00:19:58,676 --> 00:19:59,995
. . .he disappeared. . .

246
00:20:00,276 --> 00:20:02,995
. . .along with the lady's bearer bonds.

247
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:06,629
You sure you've never been there?

248
00:20:07,996 --> 00:20:09,793
Not that I recall.

249
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:14,988
An acquaintance of mine has
a photograph of the suspect.

250
00:20:16,396 --> 00:20:18,512
All they need is a name. . .

251
00:20:19,996 --> 00:20:21,987
. . .as in, strike three.

252
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:24,590
1 5 years.

253
00:20:24,996 --> 00:20:26,554
No parole.

254
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:32,628
You think you got a box big enough
to hold $1 00,000 in cash?

255
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:38,352
Come by the apartment
around 1 2 o'clock tomorrow.

256
00:20:39,076 --> 00:20:41,954
Unless you have
a previous luncheon engagement.

257
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,831
I assume you know where I live.

258
00:21:39,556 --> 00:21:40,830
I'm your best friend!

259
00:21:41,036 --> 00:21:43,834
Half the year goes by
and you don't say one thing?

260
00:21:44,076 --> 00:21:46,271
Do you love him?
Will you leave Steven?

261
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:47,825
Talk to me.

262
00:21:48,076 --> 00:21:50,032
I will if you shut up for one second.

263
00:21:50,556 --> 00:21:52,194
I'm waiting.

264
00:21:53,716 --> 00:21:55,866
I didn't tell you
because you adore Steven.

265
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:57,993
You cried at our wedding,
for God's sake.

266
00:21:58,316 --> 00:22:00,989
-I cry at every wedding.
-No, you don't.

267
00:22:01,996 --> 00:22:04,032
You like the idea of us.

268
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:05,908
Everybody does.

269
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,505
But you have no idea who he is.

270
00:22:08,876 --> 00:22:10,912
-I know Steven.
-No, you don't.

271
00:22:11,996 --> 00:22:16,672
You don't know that everything
always has to be on his terms.

272
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:20,790
You don't know that he has
no real interest in who I am.

273
00:22:26,756 --> 00:22:28,951
What are you going to do?

274
00:22:29,156 --> 00:22:30,589
I don't know.

275
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:34,313
I'm going to figure out a way
to tell him. He deserves that.

276
00:22:34,596 --> 00:22:36,393
What makes you think he doesn't know?

277
00:22:36,676 --> 00:22:38,314
Because there's no way.

278
00:22:38,596 --> 00:22:42,191
I mean, he knows that
something's not right but. . . .

279
00:22:44,236 --> 00:22:46,272
Does David have a last name?

280
00:22:47,196 --> 00:22:48,868
Shaw. David Shaw.

281
00:22:49,476 --> 00:22:51,546
And he knows about your family?

282
00:22:51,836 --> 00:22:53,394
What do you mean?

283
00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:55,346
What do you think I mean?

284
00:22:55,636 --> 00:22:58,548
We don't talk about that kind of stuff.

285
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:00,554
In six months,
you never mentioned money?

286
00:23:00,836 --> 00:23:01,871
No!

287
00:23:02,156 --> 00:23:03,953
Believe me, okay?

288
00:23:04,236 --> 00:23:08,627
David has absolutely no interest
in anything other than painting. . .

289
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,069
. . .and me.

290
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,789
And you.

291
00:23:14,196 --> 00:23:16,152
Is that why you're not wearing
your wedding ring?

292
00:23:20,956 --> 00:23:22,309
Oh, my God!

293
00:23:23,476 --> 00:23:24,386
What?

294
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,788
I left it at David's.

295
00:23:36,596 --> 00:23:37,995
Working late?

296
00:23:39,356 --> 00:23:41,153
No, I was having a drink with Raquel.

297
00:23:41,436 --> 00:23:44,712
And how is the Castilian femme fatale?

298
00:23:47,316 --> 00:23:50,467
By the way, I saw your friend
David this evening.

299
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:51,985
Really?

300
00:23:52,236 --> 00:23:55,433
He honored me with a visit
at his industrial hideaway.

301
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:56,546
You're kidding.

302
00:23:57,196 --> 00:23:59,266
And where's that?

303
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:01,228
Greenpoint, Brooklyn.

304
00:24:01,516 --> 00:24:02,995
How'd you get his number?

305
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:06,746
I called some of those
obscure galleries you prowl. . .

306
00:24:07,036 --> 00:24:08,833
. . .dropped your name.

307
00:24:09,436 --> 00:24:10,312
You're right.

308
00:24:10,676 --> 00:24:12,428
He's very talented.

309
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,315
Did you buy anything?

310
00:24:16,596 --> 00:24:18,314
I made him an offer.

311
00:24:24,276 --> 00:24:25,391
And?

312
00:24:26,476 --> 00:24:28,546
And he's chewing on it.

313
00:24:46,756 --> 00:24:48,269
Good morning.

314
00:25:06,156 --> 00:25:08,386
-Hi, it's me.
-Hey, how you doing?

315
00:25:08,836 --> 00:25:10,792
-I left my wedding ring.
-I know.

316
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,987
I put it away before he got here.

317
00:25:13,276 --> 00:25:14,789
Thank God!

318
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:18,549
What did you guys talk about?

319
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:24,071
He wasn't here that long,
so just the work.

320
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,675
He didn't have a clue.

321
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:29,829
He said that he made you an offer.

322
00:25:30,156 --> 00:25:31,430
Matter of fact, he did.

323
00:25:31,716 --> 00:25:32,751
What piece?

324
00:25:32,996 --> 00:25:35,271
It's one you haven't seen.

325
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:37,389
I thought I'd seen all of them.

326
00:25:37,676 --> 00:25:39,268
Well, almost.

327
00:25:40,156 --> 00:25:43,751
Listen, turns out I got to take
a rain check on lunch today.

328
00:25:44,036 --> 00:25:46,834
-Why? What's wrong?
-Nothing, nothing.

329
00:25:47,076 --> 00:25:49,590
Some people want to see my sketches. . .

330
00:25:49,876 --> 00:25:51,434
. . .and it'd be a good commission.

331
00:25:52,236 --> 00:25:53,464
You sound funny.

332
00:25:53,756 --> 00:25:54,905
Do l?

333
00:25:55,196 --> 00:25:56,265
Yeah.

334
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:59,311
I guess it's called
being broke, sweetheart.

335
00:26:01,356 --> 00:26:02,789
Tomorrow, then.

336
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,028
Reservation for two.

337
00:26:05,316 --> 00:26:07,227
Quiet table, in back.

338
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:08,835
Very quiet.

339
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,430
You know I love you.

340
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:14,189
I know.

341
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:15,551
Bye.

342
00:27:00,316 --> 00:27:02,034
-Is that by. . .?
-Yeah.

343
00:27:03,516 --> 00:27:06,508
People with money
always go for the same things.

344
00:27:07,396 --> 00:27:09,068
And what are those?

345
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:13,073
Anything, everything,
as long as it's recognizable.

346
00:27:13,876 --> 00:27:17,312
Don't worry. None of this
would've been yours anyway.

347
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:20,508
Everything you see here, it's mine.

348
00:27:20,796 --> 00:27:23,390
Why don't you drop that
there and come here.

349
00:27:29,116 --> 00:27:30,469
That's nice.

350
00:27:35,356 --> 00:27:37,995
There was a robbery
in the building last year.

351
00:27:38,276 --> 00:27:40,267
Probable means of entrance. . .

352
00:27:40,556 --> 00:27:42,433
. . .was this driveway gate.

353
00:27:42,716 --> 00:27:46,345
That granite facade creates a blind
spot on the surveillance cameras.

354
00:27:46,636 --> 00:27:48,467
It was never corrected,
for aesthetic reasons.

355
00:27:48,756 --> 00:27:49,905
How do you know that?

356
00:27:50,196 --> 00:27:51,834
I'm on the board.

357
00:27:56,836 --> 00:27:59,225
You enter as I leave at 8 p.m.

358
00:27:59,516 --> 00:28:02,474
I won't pull out of the driveway
till it's clear.

359
00:28:02,716 --> 00:28:04,627
The gate takes 5 seconds to close.

360
00:28:04,836 --> 00:28:07,555
Hug the right side of the wall
as I drive by.

361
00:28:07,796 --> 00:28:11,027
Then you enter the stairs
by the service elevator.

362
00:28:11,276 --> 00:28:15,508
The key to the front door also works
here for the service entrance.

363
00:28:23,516 --> 00:28:26,394
I'm going to take the key from
Emily's purse before I leave. . .

364
00:28:26,636 --> 00:28:28,194
. . .and I'll put it in this. . .

365
00:28:28,436 --> 00:28:31,508
. . .and hide it here,
right behind the pipe.

366
00:28:33,236 --> 00:28:36,114
-Where're you going to be?
-At my regular card game.

367
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:37,790
Why don't you leave me your key?

368
00:28:38,076 --> 00:28:40,544
My key implicates me.
Her key implicates no one.

369
00:28:40,796 --> 00:28:42,593
It could've been lost or stolen.

370
00:28:42,836 --> 00:28:45,748
In any case, she won't
be around to explain.

371
00:28:46,036 --> 00:28:47,435
Why not make a copy of the key?

372
00:28:47,716 --> 00:28:50,753
It's two loose ends,
the key and the locksmith.

373
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:56,594
This door is always bolted. She
won't notice, even if she checks it.

374
00:28:56,876 --> 00:28:59,106
You'll be in the stairwell at 9:30.

375
00:28:59,396 --> 00:29:02,274
By that time, Emily
will be taking her bath.

376
00:29:02,556 --> 00:29:04,035
She will? How do you know?

377
00:29:04,316 --> 00:29:07,672
Because that's what she does
on nights that I play cards.

378
00:29:08,676 --> 00:29:10,189
Why not do it in the tub?

379
00:29:11,196 --> 00:29:13,710
Because that'll look like
cold-blooded murder.

380
00:29:13,956 --> 00:29:17,187
It has to appear that
she surprised the intruder.

381
00:29:17,436 --> 00:29:18,630
All right?

382
00:29:20,476 --> 00:29:22,387
This is a separate telephone line.

383
00:29:22,676 --> 00:29:26,112
Exactly 1 0 p.m., I will call here.

384
00:29:26,396 --> 00:29:28,626
Emily will answer the phone.

385
00:29:29,716 --> 00:29:31,513
You will enter.

386
00:29:32,196 --> 00:29:35,313
A tragic confrontation will ensue.

387
00:29:36,476 --> 00:29:38,148
It should appear to be. . .

388
00:29:38,436 --> 00:29:39,835
. . .stupid. . .

389
00:29:40,316 --> 00:29:42,193
. . .and spur-of-the-moment.

390
00:29:43,196 --> 00:29:47,508
I've always thought "bludgeon"
has a spur-of-the-moment sound.

391
00:29:47,796 --> 00:29:49,070
Maybe you could use one of these.

392
00:29:51,476 --> 00:29:54,036
Rifle the jewelry in the bedroom.

393
00:29:54,316 --> 00:29:57,626
Disable the service entrance lock.
Make it look like it was jimmied.

394
00:29:57,916 --> 00:30:01,386
Put the key back under the pipe,
then leave the way you came in.

395
00:30:02,516 --> 00:30:04,552
And what happens
if the plan goes to hell?

396
00:30:05,876 --> 00:30:07,229
It won't.

397
00:30:24,516 --> 00:30:26,234
So when is this card game of yours?

398
00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:27,955
-Tomorrow night.
-Tomorrow?

399
00:30:28,316 --> 00:30:29,635
No fucking way!

400
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:32,874
A man with your résumé should
come up with an alibi in no time.

401
00:30:33,156 --> 00:30:34,908
1 00 thousand.

402
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:39,548
A man with my résumé should
take the money and run.

403
00:30:39,836 --> 00:30:42,270
Bet you 400 thousand more you don't.

404
00:31:28,316 --> 00:31:29,192
Yes, I understand that.

405
00:31:29,476 --> 00:31:31,546
But if we can't get numbers
on refugee density. . .

406
00:31:31,836 --> 00:31:34,225
. . .then we can't position
the resources to deal with it.

407
00:31:34,716 --> 00:31:38,311
I'll tell her to expect it
later today. Thank you.

408
00:32:02,956 --> 00:32:05,106
That's not happiness to see me, is it?

409
00:32:06,116 --> 00:32:07,435
Try surprise.

410
00:32:07,716 --> 00:32:09,468
I had a hole in my schedule. . .

411
00:32:09,676 --> 00:32:13,112
. . .and I thought lunch with my
beautiful wife would be indicated.

412
00:32:13,956 --> 00:32:15,389
But I guess you have other plans.

413
00:32:15,636 --> 00:32:17,672
-What makes you say that?
-You seem in such a hurry.

414
00:32:17,956 --> 00:32:19,105
It's just errands.

415
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,466
Like shopping for a new wedding ring.

416
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:23,747
One of the settings felt loose. . .

417
00:32:24,036 --> 00:32:26,345
. . .so I took it in.
It'll be ready tomorrow.

418
00:32:26,716 --> 00:32:28,547
And what if there were no tomorrow?

419
00:32:29,396 --> 00:32:30,670
What does that mean?

420
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:34,273
Wouldn't you regret not having
one last lunch with your husband?

421
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,389
Of course.

422
00:33:07,316 --> 00:33:10,353
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you very much.

423
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:24,955
I must reply to Francesca about
this weekend. Want to do it?

424
00:33:25,596 --> 00:33:27,188
All right, we'll go out--

425
00:33:28,796 --> 00:33:31,833
I got to break this up.
Excuse me one minute.

426
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:34,672
Hey, it's David. Leave one.
I'll get back to you.

427
00:34:35,636 --> 00:34:36,625
David?

428
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,833
He was waiting for me...

429
00:34:41,076 --> 00:34:41,906
. . .to take me to lunch.

430
00:34:42,156 --> 00:34:44,067
There was nothing I could do.

431
00:34:49,876 --> 00:34:52,436
I can't do this anymore.
I've got to tell him tonight.

432
00:34:54,116 --> 00:34:55,265
Hi, I'm here.

433
00:34:57,116 --> 00:34:58,231
I'm really sorry.

434
00:34:59,236 --> 00:35:00,066
It's okay.

435
00:35:00,316 --> 00:35:03,194
He's never done that before.
Something's wrong. He knows.

436
00:35:03,516 --> 00:35:04,869
No, he doesn't.

437
00:35:05,156 --> 00:35:06,908
Don't let your mind
get away from you.

438
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:10,514
I cannot live like this anymore.

439
00:35:10,756 --> 00:35:13,668
It's not fair to him.
I've got to tell him.

440
00:35:14,116 --> 00:35:15,947
Tell him what, exactly?

441
00:35:16,236 --> 00:35:17,954
Tell him everything, tonight.

442
00:35:20,276 --> 00:35:22,506
We've waited this long.
Hold off another day. . .

443
00:35:22,876 --> 00:35:24,992
...so we can figure it out together.

444
00:35:25,396 --> 00:35:26,272
You know?

445
00:35:26,476 --> 00:35:28,194
So I can help you.

446
00:35:29,236 --> 00:35:30,191
I don't know.

447
00:35:30,436 --> 00:35:31,630
I do.

448
00:35:32,996 --> 00:35:34,349
I do know.

449
00:35:35,516 --> 00:35:37,427
Honey, don 't panic.

450
00:35:53,556 --> 00:35:55,547
Good night, Mr. Taylor.

451
00:35:55,836 --> 00:35:56,985
I'm on my way.

452
00:35:57,596 --> 00:35:59,666
Everything's prepared for you.

453
00:36:01,196 --> 00:36:03,471
Give my best to Mrs. Taylor.

454
00:36:34,236 --> 00:36:36,386
So how was the rest of your day?

455
00:36:37,716 --> 00:36:39,388
Fairly brutal.

456
00:36:40,596 --> 00:36:42,393
I'm sorry to hear about that.

457
00:36:45,756 --> 00:36:47,428
I don't want you to go tonight.

458
00:36:49,996 --> 00:36:51,190
What's wrong?

459
00:36:53,236 --> 00:36:55,147
I'd like to talk to you.

460
00:36:57,796 --> 00:36:59,229
It's too late.

461
00:37:00,156 --> 00:37:02,306
They'll never get anybody to fill in.

462
00:37:03,476 --> 00:37:07,754
Besides, I beat them last week.
They'll want their money back.

463
00:38:45,236 --> 00:38:46,828
You scared me.

464
00:38:48,516 --> 00:38:50,507
I just wanted to say goodbye.

465
00:39:01,236 --> 00:39:02,351
I'll call you later.

466
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:08,389
I might go to Nick's for a burger.
If nobody's here, don't worry.

467
00:39:10,236 --> 00:39:13,308
I won't,
but you might want to reconsider.

468
00:39:13,556 --> 00:39:14,875
Why is that?

469
00:39:15,156 --> 00:39:17,386
I had Janice make
one of her legendary roasts.

470
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:19,071
Really?

471
00:39:20,956 --> 00:39:22,514
Thought we'd eat before the game.

472
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:25,384
Wish me luck.

473
00:39:26,356 --> 00:39:27,675
Good luck.

474
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:13,149
$1 ,000 to you, George.

475
00:41:13,356 --> 00:41:14,425
Fold.

476
00:41:18,356 --> 00:41:19,914
-Call.
-Down and dirty.

477
00:41:20,156 --> 00:41:21,828
Last one, gentlemen.

478
00:41:28,276 --> 00:41:31,746
-Got to have more than that.
-Three sixes still bets.

479
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:07,712
-Gentlemen, same game.
-It's getting a little boring.

480
00:42:17,036 --> 00:42:18,310
I'm out.

481
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:39,912
Must be morning in Hong Kong.

482
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:02,065
There's my cards.

483
00:43:02,676 --> 00:43:04,712
Let's have a better hand this time.

484
00:43:41,396 --> 00:43:42,715
You've got to be kidding me.

485
00:44:09,876 --> 00:44:11,707
That's a serious bet.

486
00:44:19,396 --> 00:44:20,954
Who is this?

487
00:45:44,356 --> 00:45:45,584
I'm in.

488
00:45:46,116 --> 00:45:48,949
-Put your money up, here we go.
-Just in time!

489
00:45:49,196 --> 00:45:51,585
Different winner this time,
though, guys.

490
00:45:52,156 --> 00:45:53,350
I liked the last one.

491
00:47:22,276 --> 00:47:23,834
Oh, my God!

492
00:47:27,196 --> 00:47:29,790
-What happened?
-Mrs. Taylor, we have your location.

493
00:47:30,036 --> 00:47:31,628
He's in the kitchen.

494
00:47:31,876 --> 00:47:33,628
Please stay on the line.

495
00:47:34,516 --> 00:47:36,234
Ma 'am? Ma 'am?

496
00:47:42,956 --> 00:47:44,150
Oh, Jesus!

497
00:49:00,156 --> 00:49:01,714
Police! Open up!

498
00:49:10,076 --> 00:49:11,304
Open up!

499
00:49:12,956 --> 00:49:14,514
-Mr. Taylor?
-We're all right.

500
00:49:14,756 --> 00:49:17,395
He's in the kitchen.
I think he's dead. Follow me.

501
00:49:30,356 --> 00:49:32,233
You didn't hear any. . .

502
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:34,986
. . .strange sounds. . .

503
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:38,670
. . .prior to your entering the kitchen?

504
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:41,992
No, just the phone call.

505
00:49:42,276 --> 00:49:44,949
But before that, nothing unusual?

506
00:49:52,596 --> 00:49:55,588
-How you guys doing?
-We're pretty set here.

507
00:49:55,876 --> 00:49:58,071
I want you to dust the elevator cage. . .

508
00:49:58,596 --> 00:50:00,188
. . .and the banister.

509
00:50:00,436 --> 00:50:03,428
Mo, be out of here in 1 5, 20 minutes.

510
00:50:05,316 --> 00:50:06,385
Maybe.

511
00:50:13,556 --> 00:50:15,547
-Detective Karaman.
-Steven Taylor.

512
00:50:15,796 --> 00:50:17,912
Pleasure, sir.
Mind if I ask you a few questions?

513
00:50:18,196 --> 00:50:19,345
No. Not at all.

514
00:50:19,996 --> 00:50:22,112
I noticed what I assume
to be your footprints. . .

515
00:50:22,356 --> 00:50:24,506
. . .in the blood around the deceased.

516
00:50:25,276 --> 00:50:27,232
-Can I assume those are yours?
-Yes, you may.

517
00:50:27,476 --> 00:50:28,829
May I ask what you were doing?

518
00:50:30,276 --> 00:50:31,868
Making sure he was dead.

519
00:50:33,436 --> 00:50:34,152
Was he?

520
00:50:34,436 --> 00:50:36,074
Appeared to be, yes.

521
00:50:36,436 --> 00:50:37,391
Take his pulse?

522
00:50:38,476 --> 00:50:39,272
No.

523
00:50:40,756 --> 00:50:41,666
You see right there?

524
00:50:43,516 --> 00:50:45,313
Did you lean over him for something?

525
00:50:45,556 --> 00:50:47,911
I tried to determine whether
he was breathing.

526
00:50:49,196 --> 00:50:51,630
-Was he?
-Not at that time.

527
00:50:51,876 --> 00:50:53,025
Let's take a look.

528
00:51:15,916 --> 00:51:17,190
Something wrong?

529
00:51:19,556 --> 00:51:22,354
Aside from a dead man
lying in my kitchen?

530
00:51:23,516 --> 00:51:25,268
For a moment,
I thought you knew the man.

531
00:51:25,676 --> 00:51:27,667
-I don't think so.
-Why's that?

532
00:51:28,956 --> 00:51:30,594
I never forget a face.

533
00:51:30,876 --> 00:51:31,706
Anything else?

534
00:51:31,996 --> 00:51:32,826
No.

535
00:51:33,596 --> 00:51:35,632
Your wife must come down
to give a statement.

536
00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:36,746
When?

537
00:51:36,996 --> 00:51:38,224
As soon as she's ready.

538
00:51:38,676 --> 00:51:39,506
Mr. Taylor. . .

539
00:51:39,756 --> 00:51:42,748
. . .are you aware of anyone
who might wish your wife harm?

540
00:51:43,196 --> 00:51:45,346
My wife has no enemies.

541
00:51:46,996 --> 00:51:48,475
Thanks, Detective.

542
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,107
I know, baby, I know.

543
00:52:01,716 --> 00:52:02,910
It's okay.

544
00:52:05,436 --> 00:52:07,233
You're going to be all right.

545
00:52:15,476 --> 00:52:16,955
What do you think?

546
00:52:17,476 --> 00:52:18,795
I believe her.

547
00:52:19,076 --> 00:52:20,475
What about him?

548
00:52:23,996 --> 00:52:25,554
I couldn't say.

549
00:52:30,196 --> 00:52:31,151
You know, Mo. . .

550
00:52:33,036 --> 00:52:35,391
. . .rich people are different
from you and me.

551
00:52:35,676 --> 00:52:36,711
How?

552
00:52:36,996 --> 00:52:39,669
They got a fuck of a lot more money,
for one thing.

553
00:52:40,676 --> 00:52:42,348
Very good, Bobby.

554
00:53:33,396 --> 00:53:36,786
Hey, Mo, you going to turn it up,
or what?

555
00:53:40,356 --> 00:53:42,153
I like it like this.

556
00:53:42,996 --> 00:53:44,475
You had said before. . .

557
00:53:45,356 --> 00:53:47,665
. . .that they did not speak.

558
00:53:48,036 --> 00:53:49,025
They didn't.

559
00:53:49,316 --> 00:53:50,510
They listened.

560
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:52,713
Background noise?
Did you hear any?

561
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:55,066
There wasn't any.
She told you.

562
00:53:55,356 --> 00:53:57,824
Maybe you should let your wife
answer the questions.

563
00:53:58,076 --> 00:54:00,067
She's been through enough tonight.

564
00:54:01,436 --> 00:54:03,552
We're almost through, Mrs. Taylor.

565
00:54:03,836 --> 00:54:06,953
There's just a few more things
I'd like to ask.

566
00:54:07,236 --> 00:54:10,467
Remember what time you got home,
Mr. Taylor?

567
00:54:12,596 --> 00:54:16,430
1 1 , 1 1 :30. Came from my regular
card game at the Drake Club.

568
00:54:20,836 --> 00:54:21,825
You'll love this.

569
00:54:27,796 --> 00:54:29,832
We've l.D.'d the man
who broke into your home.

570
00:54:31,356 --> 00:54:32,152
May l?

571
00:54:32,396 --> 00:54:33,226
Sure.

572
00:54:36,756 --> 00:54:38,314
This man is a career criminal.

573
00:54:38,596 --> 00:54:42,066
You couldn't dream up a better
defense for justifiable homicide.

574
00:54:43,356 --> 00:54:46,985
Your wife's on three.
She says it's an emergency.

575
00:55:04,836 --> 00:55:06,792
How old is your boy?

576
00:55:10,596 --> 00:55:11,824
One month.

577
00:55:12,316 --> 00:55:13,385
Is he ill?

578
00:55:13,756 --> 00:55:15,235
Colic.

579
00:55:15,476 --> 00:55:17,592
May God watch over your son
and protect him.

580
00:55:18,116 --> 00:55:19,231
And you as well.

581
00:55:21,356 --> 00:55:22,471
I'm glad we cleared that up.

582
00:55:24,076 --> 00:55:26,306
I'm going to ask you
not to leave the city.

583
00:55:27,996 --> 00:55:29,031
But she is.

584
00:55:29,276 --> 00:55:32,268
We're going to her mother's house.
Roger has the telephone number.

585
00:55:32,556 --> 00:55:33,511
Wait. Hold on.

586
00:55:33,796 --> 00:55:36,230
Why? She hasn't been charged.
Her statement's complete.

587
00:55:36,476 --> 00:55:38,706
So it's really just a matter
of courtesy.

588
00:55:38,956 --> 00:55:40,230
Courtesy on our part.

589
00:55:41,716 --> 00:55:44,708
If you think of anything else,
give me a ring.

590
00:55:46,956 --> 00:55:48,594
I don't know what else
there is to think of.

591
00:55:49,156 --> 00:55:50,714
Probably nothing.

592
00:55:51,956 --> 00:55:53,184
May you go in safety.

593
00:55:53,596 --> 00:55:54,915
And you as well.

594
00:56:47,316 --> 00:56:48,908
My baby!

595
00:57:08,236 --> 00:57:10,227
I'm just down the hall, baby.

596
00:57:49,116 --> 00:57:50,469
Here you go.

597
00:57:53,316 --> 00:57:56,228
By tomorrow, this will all seem
like a bad dream.

598
00:58:02,676 --> 00:58:05,031
And what if there were no tomorrow?

599
00:58:12,436 --> 00:58:14,392
You know better than that.

600
00:58:18,276 --> 00:58:19,834
Sleep well.

601
00:58:38,116 --> 00:58:39,754
Please tell me.

602
00:58:40,236 --> 00:58:41,988
How could something like this happen?

603
00:58:42,236 --> 00:58:43,954
Sandra, I don't know.

604
00:58:44,236 --> 00:58:47,387
I've gone over it
a thousand times myself.

605
00:58:47,716 --> 00:58:49,593
The world's gone crazy.

606
00:59:18,836 --> 00:59:22,067
Roger's prepared a statement
the D.A. wants me to sign.

607
00:59:22,316 --> 00:59:24,784
So I'll head back into the city. . .

608
00:59:25,196 --> 00:59:26,948
. . .and come back in the morning
to pick up Emily. . .

609
00:59:27,236 --> 00:59:29,192
. . .if she's all right.

610
00:59:32,956 --> 00:59:34,389
It's me.

611
00:59:36,076 --> 00:59:38,465
I just wanted to tell you I'm okay.

612
00:59:40,756 --> 00:59:44,351
I'm not in the city,
but I'll call as soon as I can.

613
00:59:46,436 --> 00:59:47,835
I love you.

614
00:59:53,796 --> 00:59:55,673
I don't want her to be rushed.

615
01:00:11,036 --> 01:00:12,594
No, of course not.

616
01:00:12,916 --> 01:00:14,634
I don't want her to be rushed either.

617
01:00:14,876 --> 01:00:16,946
I'm going to check on our patient.

618
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:49,668
Sorry, David.
Emily's resting right now.

619
01:00:49,996 --> 01:00:53,147
But I think we've got
something to talk about.

620
01:01:24,836 --> 01:01:26,235
Who was he?

621
01:01:27,876 --> 01:01:30,231
Somebody I met at Berkeley.

622
01:01:31,276 --> 01:01:33,346
Can he be connected to you?

623
01:01:34,276 --> 01:01:35,834
Not anymore.

624
01:01:42,356 --> 01:01:44,870
You got any idea
who you're fucking with?

625
01:01:47,196 --> 01:01:48,231
Yeah.

626
01:01:48,956 --> 01:01:50,548
You hired me
to kill your wife. . .

627
01:01:50,796 --> 01:01:52,468
. . .because you couldn't
do the wet work yourself.

628
01:01:53,316 --> 01:01:54,988
Well, neither could l.

629
01:01:58,596 --> 01:02:00,712
So how do you know
he didn't talk to someone?

630
01:02:01,796 --> 01:02:03,354
Ron was a good man.

631
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,592
Not quite good enough.

632
01:02:14,676 --> 01:02:16,553
So what's plan B?

633
01:02:17,356 --> 01:02:20,473
It's a little coincidental
if there's another attempt on her life.

634
01:02:20,756 --> 01:02:22,428
Gee, you think?

635
01:02:25,036 --> 01:02:26,264
So we wait.

636
01:02:26,836 --> 01:02:28,269
For what?

637
01:02:30,076 --> 01:02:31,794
I'll let you know.

638
01:02:40,516 --> 01:02:43,588
Do I keep fucking your wife
in the meantime, or what?

639
01:02:55,636 --> 01:02:57,115
Thank you, Charles.

640
01:03:02,076 --> 01:03:04,032
Steven called while you were asleep.

641
01:03:04,316 --> 01:03:06,625
He's getting everything ready
for you to come home.

642
01:03:07,676 --> 01:03:10,315
He wants to send the car
for you tomorrow.

643
01:03:10,676 --> 01:03:12,428
I'm not going home.

644
01:03:13,636 --> 01:03:16,514
I'm going to move in with Raquel
for a while.

645
01:03:18,276 --> 01:03:20,153
Em, what's going on?

646
01:03:21,996 --> 01:03:23,907
I'm leaving Steven.

647
01:03:56,036 --> 01:03:58,311
They've started liquidating
your long positions to cover.

648
01:03:59,876 --> 01:04:00,865
Which ones?

649
01:04:01,156 --> 01:04:02,635
DMG and Barclays.

650
01:04:03,036 --> 01:04:04,674
Why didn't anybody tell me?

651
01:04:04,956 --> 01:04:07,948
We tried, Steven.
We couldn't find you.

652
01:04:08,436 --> 01:04:10,347
I said no calls!

653
01:04:42,956 --> 01:04:43,991
Albert.

654
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:47,748
-May I please have our house key?
-Sure, Mrs. Taylor.

655
01:04:48,716 --> 01:04:49,705
What happened to yours?

656
01:04:50,076 --> 01:04:52,032
I've absolutely no idea.
It doesn't work.

657
01:04:53,156 --> 01:04:54,874
Did my husband change the locks?

658
01:04:56,276 --> 01:04:58,392
No, not that I know of.

659
01:06:10,836 --> 01:06:12,030
Emily, it's me.

660
01:06:12,596 --> 01:06:14,666
I didn't hear you come in.

661
01:06:14,916 --> 01:06:16,793
You left the front door wide open.

662
01:06:20,396 --> 01:06:21,431
Don't.

663
01:06:23,316 --> 01:06:24,954
I'm your husband.

664
01:06:27,236 --> 01:06:29,704
Oh, God! I can't stay here.

665
01:06:29,996 --> 01:06:33,306
It's all right.
We'll get out of here tonight.

666
01:06:34,356 --> 01:06:36,233
I can't stay with you, Steven.

667
01:06:36,516 --> 01:06:38,472
I can't stay with you anymore.

668
01:06:38,836 --> 01:06:41,669
Raquel's waiting for me downstairs.

669
01:06:56,156 --> 01:06:58,306
Okay, there are fresh towels
in the bathroom. . .

670
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,353
. . .and you can have anything
you want in the fridge. . .

671
01:07:00,596 --> 01:07:02,234
. . .including your favorite yogurt.

672
01:07:03,116 --> 01:07:04,913
Let me ask you a question.

673
01:07:06,116 --> 01:07:09,745
What do you think Steven would do
if he knew about David?

674
01:07:15,236 --> 01:07:18,831
Screwing around is the
second oldest reason to kill somebody.

675
01:07:19,116 --> 01:07:21,346
Really?
And what would be the first?

676
01:07:22,436 --> 01:07:23,835
Money, honey.

677
01:07:29,156 --> 01:07:30,669
But Steven's rich. . .

678
01:07:30,876 --> 01:07:34,346
. . .and with your money,
you must've had a prenup.

679
01:07:37,836 --> 01:07:39,633
Tell me you had a prenup.

680
01:07:40,596 --> 01:07:42,393
He offered. I said no.

681
01:07:44,756 --> 01:07:47,350
So if you die, he gets, like. . .

682
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:49,029
. . .a hundred million bucks?

683
01:07:49,756 --> 01:07:51,587
Something like that.

684
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,675
Lucky guy.

685
01:08:13,636 --> 01:08:17,390
I assume you have a very good reason
for asking me to do this.

686
01:08:19,156 --> 01:08:21,750
We'll sure miss you around here.

687
01:08:22,636 --> 01:08:23,625
Come.

688
01:08:24,796 --> 01:08:26,991
Come and see me on your way out.

689
01:08:28,676 --> 01:08:30,109
This is Robert Harrington.

690
01:08:30,396 --> 01:08:33,832
Bobby is the Deputy Director
of the Commodities Trade Commission.

691
01:08:34,116 --> 01:08:35,310
Please.

692
01:08:36,596 --> 01:08:38,507
Take all the time you need.

693
01:08:46,356 --> 01:08:47,789
Mrs. Taylor. . .

694
01:08:47,996 --> 01:08:50,794
. . .passing this kind of information,
even to a spouse. . .

695
01:08:51,036 --> 01:08:52,549
. . .is unethical.

696
01:08:52,796 --> 01:08:54,195
I understand.

697
01:08:56,436 --> 01:09:00,270
Your husband has been buying U.S.
and foreign bonds on margin. . .

698
01:09:00,476 --> 01:09:02,831
. . .and using those securities
as collateral.

699
01:09:03,796 --> 01:09:04,945
That's illegal.

700
01:09:05,156 --> 01:09:08,705
In fact, his company's been under
investigation for almost a year.

701
01:09:09,396 --> 01:09:10,465
Some months ago. . .

702
01:09:10,756 --> 01:09:13,111
. . .U.S. interest rates
started moving against him.

703
01:09:13,556 --> 01:09:16,229
He should've gotten some horrific
margin calls. . .

704
01:09:16,516 --> 01:09:19,189
. . .but the banks he's in bed with
have hidden the losses. . .

705
01:09:19,476 --> 01:09:21,706
. . .hoping that things
will turn around.

706
01:09:22,236 --> 01:09:23,794
It isn't happening.

707
01:09:24,436 --> 01:09:25,949
Sooner or later. . .

708
01:09:26,236 --> 01:09:28,545
. . .those margin calls will come.

709
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:31,424
And when they do,
your husband will be. . .

710
01:09:32,116 --> 01:09:33,310
. . .wiped out.

711
01:09:56,436 --> 01:09:58,154
Yep, where's the subpoena?

712
01:09:58,396 --> 01:10:00,591
But I can't get
the records without it.

713
01:10:01,596 --> 01:10:03,427
I've waited two days.

714
01:10:06,196 --> 01:10:07,595
Just get back to me.

715
01:10:09,556 --> 01:10:12,548
-Detective.
-Please sit down.

716
01:10:15,236 --> 01:10:17,670
To what do I owe the pleasure,
Mrs. Taylor?

717
01:10:20,276 --> 01:10:22,665
I have some information
about my husband.

718
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:23,951
Concerning?

719
01:10:25,876 --> 01:10:28,913
It seems he's in
serious financial trouble. . .

720
01:10:29,196 --> 01:10:31,505
. . .and he was hiding it from me.

721
01:10:31,996 --> 01:10:33,827
And I thought that. . .

722
01:10:34,676 --> 01:10:36,314
. . .might be a possible reason. . .

723
01:10:36,996 --> 01:10:38,270
. . .a possible reason for him to--

724
01:10:38,556 --> 01:10:39,955
Hire someone to kill you?

725
01:10:41,276 --> 01:10:42,504
Yes.

726
01:10:45,756 --> 01:10:48,224
I know what you're worth,
Mrs. Taylor. . .

727
01:10:49,876 --> 01:10:51,673
. . .and that kind of money
is always a motive.

728
01:10:51,916 --> 01:10:54,111
Do you mean he's already a suspect?

729
01:10:54,396 --> 01:10:55,749
Was.

730
01:10:56,516 --> 01:10:59,792
Until we traced a phone call he made
the night you were attacked.

731
01:10:59,996 --> 01:11:03,147
The trace led us to an automated
quote system at his office.

732
01:11:03,796 --> 01:11:07,755
It lasted from five minutes
before ten to nine minutes after.

733
01:11:08,116 --> 01:11:10,391
That has to be one of the cleaner
alibis I've come across.

734
01:11:11,996 --> 01:11:14,146
I took your case apart
a thousand times. . .

735
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:15,915
. . .then I put it back together again.

736
01:11:16,196 --> 01:11:18,585
There was always one piece left. . .

737
01:11:18,876 --> 01:11:20,025
. . . 1 ike a screw that didn't fit.

738
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:24,025
The dead man had a wallet,
cash and change, driver's license. . .

739
01:11:24,316 --> 01:11:26,750
. . .membership card
to a video store, but. . .

740
01:11:27,036 --> 01:11:28,708
. . .not a single key.

741
01:11:29,236 --> 01:11:30,635
Not one.

742
01:11:31,356 --> 01:11:33,586
Not even to his apartment.

743
01:11:36,916 --> 01:11:40,909
Elliot, it's a zero-sum game.
You don't have the balls for it.

744
01:11:41,156 --> 01:11:44,512
By tomorrow, neither of us
will have any balls left.

745
01:11:44,756 --> 01:11:46,587
-Don't panic.
-You're damn right I am.

746
01:11:46,836 --> 01:11:48,952
You drop 50 million in a day.

747
01:11:49,196 --> 01:11:50,993
You know how fast 50 becomes 500?

748
01:11:51,836 --> 01:11:53,394
Not now. What's the spot rate?

749
01:11:53,636 --> 01:11:55,592
We're sitting at ground zero.

750
01:11:55,836 --> 01:11:57,554
You're telling me,
"Think happy thoughts"?

751
01:11:57,876 --> 01:11:58,945
I said, not now!

752
01:11:59,236 --> 01:12:02,546
I'm sorry, but I have a caller
who says this is an emergency.

753
01:12:02,796 --> 01:12:04,149
He says it concerns Emily.

754
01:12:06,676 --> 01:12:09,429
-Who is it?
-He won 't identify himself.

755
01:12:13,716 --> 01:12:15,195
Who is this?

756
01:12:16,076 --> 01:12:18,636
A tragic confrontation will ensue.

757
01:12:19,996 --> 01:12:21,668
It should appear to be...

758
01:12:21,956 --> 01:12:23,355
...stupid and...

759
01:12:23,716 --> 01:12:25,468
...spur-of-the-moment.

760
01:12:25,756 --> 01:12:29,112
I've always thought that "bludgeon"
has a spur-of-the-moment sound.

761
01:12:29,396 --> 01:12:32,786
Maybe you could use one of these.

762
01:12:36,796 --> 01:12:39,754
Meet me at the diner at the corner
of Maiden and South.

763
01:12:40,196 --> 01:12:41,424
Right now.

764
01:12:48,356 --> 01:12:50,187
He was a con named Ronald Diggs.

765
01:12:50,476 --> 01:12:53,036
Fresh from state prison in California.

766
01:13:13,036 --> 01:13:14,310
Must be hard for you.

767
01:13:46,876 --> 01:13:48,468
Mr. Taylor.

768
01:13:48,956 --> 01:13:52,266
You didn't get those fancy shoes
dirty walking over here, did you?

769
01:13:52,596 --> 01:13:53,870
What do you want?

770
01:13:54,156 --> 01:13:55,794
The rest of my money.

771
01:13:56,596 --> 01:13:59,793
You didn't fulfill your end
of the bargain, did you?

772
01:14:00,876 --> 01:14:01,752
So?

773
01:14:02,596 --> 01:14:04,075
So what do I get?

774
01:14:04,956 --> 01:14:07,072
You get this superfine thing.

775
01:14:07,356 --> 01:14:09,506
Hell, you might even call it. . . .

776
01:14:09,876 --> 01:14:11,025
What was that?

777
01:14:11,276 --> 01:14:12,755
"Legitimately sublime. "

778
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:16,908
What exactly is this superfine thing?

779
01:14:17,276 --> 01:14:18,311
You're looking at it.

780
01:14:18,556 --> 01:14:21,195
It's called time outside of prison,
old partner.

781
01:14:21,476 --> 01:14:23,148
You can't beat it with a stick.

782
01:14:26,676 --> 01:14:31,147
Exactly how much time
does $400,000 buy me?

783
01:14:33,756 --> 01:14:35,826
Whatever the market will bear.

784
01:14:39,676 --> 01:14:40,995
It'll take me a few days.

785
01:14:42,676 --> 01:14:43,950
You got four hours.

786
01:14:44,436 --> 01:14:46,233
That's impossible and you know it.

787
01:14:47,876 --> 01:14:49,309
Come on, Steve.

788
01:14:49,596 --> 01:14:53,191
A man with your résumé should
come up with 400 grand in no time.

789
01:14:57,036 --> 01:14:57,946
Where?

790
01:14:58,236 --> 01:14:59,589
My place.

791
01:15:00,076 --> 01:15:02,192
You don't show up with the cash. . .

792
01:15:03,636 --> 01:15:05,991
. . .I'll do a mailing of
Steven's greatest hits.

793
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:08,715
I understand.

794
01:15:14,396 --> 01:15:16,591
Make fucking sure you do.

795
01:15:44,596 --> 01:15:46,075
Hey, Blondie!

796
01:15:46,436 --> 01:15:47,346
What are you doing here?

797
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:48,872
Excuse me.

798
01:15:49,076 --> 01:15:51,431
I'm looking for apartment 209.

799
01:15:59,156 --> 01:16:00,384
This way?

800
01:16:01,956 --> 01:16:02,866
Thank you.

801
01:16:09,876 --> 01:16:11,309
There's a blonde coming up.

802
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:12,871
Leave her alone.

803
01:16:13,796 --> 01:16:14,706
A blonde?

804
01:16:14,956 --> 01:16:16,150
Send her right up!

805
01:18:55,236 --> 01:18:57,625
That's not happiness
to see me, is it?

806
01:19:00,436 --> 01:19:01,755
Try surprise.

807
01:19:06,076 --> 01:19:10,035
The key to the dead man's
apartment was on my key chain.

808
01:19:11,196 --> 01:19:13,027
Someone put it there
after I killed him.

809
01:19:13,276 --> 01:19:16,666
Only one person in the world
could've done that.

810
01:19:17,636 --> 01:19:18,785
Me.

811
01:19:19,556 --> 01:19:20,750
Why?

812
01:19:21,196 --> 01:19:22,390
To protect you.

813
01:19:22,636 --> 01:19:23,955
From what?

814
01:19:26,316 --> 01:19:27,510
Your lover.

815
01:19:29,516 --> 01:19:32,792
Unless somebody else
sent these pictures.

816
01:19:52,156 --> 01:19:55,228
Amazing how you know people are in love,
even across the street.

817
01:19:55,876 --> 01:19:57,832
He called me here two months ago. . .

818
01:19:58,076 --> 01:20:00,715
. . .bragged about how
you'd fallen for him.

819
01:20:01,156 --> 01:20:03,386
I've shelled out over
$1 00,000 already. . .

820
01:20:03,676 --> 01:20:04,995
. . .but he wants a lot more.

821
01:20:05,476 --> 01:20:06,352
For what?

822
01:20:07,196 --> 01:20:08,834
For breaking it off.

823
01:20:10,756 --> 01:20:12,269
I don't believe you.

824
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:16,555
Did he mention Belize?

825
01:20:19,636 --> 01:20:21,228
That's where he took
all the other ones.

826
01:20:22,996 --> 01:20:26,671
This guy was quite an aphrodisiac
for lonely women of means.

827
01:20:27,516 --> 01:20:30,076
He learned to paint in prison. . .

828
01:20:30,276 --> 01:20:31,709
. . .not at Berkeley.

829
01:20:46,876 --> 01:20:48,548
I don't know where we go from here.

830
01:20:48,796 --> 01:20:51,754
I don't even know if "we"
is an option.

831
01:20:52,356 --> 01:20:56,747
I have done everything in my power
to protect you from this. . .

832
01:20:56,996 --> 01:21:00,511
. . .career criminal that you've let
crawl into our bed.

833
01:21:01,556 --> 01:21:03,069
Why didn't you tell me?

834
01:21:04,796 --> 01:21:06,514
I was sure you were in love with him.

835
01:21:07,636 --> 01:21:08,955
Are you?

836
01:21:11,396 --> 01:21:13,512
I thought that I was.

837
01:21:16,316 --> 01:21:19,194
I can only imagine
what I've put you through.

838
01:21:25,676 --> 01:21:27,314
Is this why your business
is in trouble?

839
01:21:28,156 --> 01:21:29,305
Trouble?

840
01:21:30,036 --> 01:21:31,708
The banks, margin calls.

841
01:21:33,596 --> 01:21:36,827
How did you know. . .?
It hasn't helped, no.

842
01:21:38,076 --> 01:21:40,715
-But it's true, isn't it?
-Yes, it's true.

843
01:21:40,956 --> 01:21:42,867
But I can always make money.

844
01:21:43,116 --> 01:21:45,391
There's a goddamn sea of it out there.

845
01:21:45,716 --> 01:21:47,434
But there's only one of you.

846
01:21:49,116 --> 01:21:52,153
But why did you put his key
on my key chain?

847
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:57,749
David threatened violence
from the very beginning.

848
01:21:58,076 --> 01:22:01,148
When I saw the body,
I was sure it was him.

849
01:22:01,996 --> 01:22:05,193
No doors had been forced open,
so I assumed that he had your key.

850
01:22:05,476 --> 01:22:07,592
But when? I'd used it
to come home that evening.

851
01:22:09,436 --> 01:22:12,872
Are you sure you used your key?
lf memory serves me. . .

852
01:22:13,156 --> 01:22:16,592
. . .the door was wide open.
I saw you walk in.

853
01:22:16,836 --> 01:22:17,905
Maybe.

854
01:22:18,396 --> 01:22:21,274
In which case, he could've
taken your key anytime. . .

855
01:22:21,476 --> 01:22:25,549
. . .even the day before.
Did you see him the day before?

856
01:22:26,076 --> 01:22:27,111
Yes.

857
01:22:27,396 --> 01:22:31,355
I searched his pockets,
I found what I thought was your key. . .

858
01:22:31,556 --> 01:22:34,832
. . .I grabbed a screwdriver,
jimmied the door.

859
01:22:35,076 --> 01:22:37,749
I put it in his pocket,
took what I thought was your key. . .

860
01:22:38,316 --> 01:22:40,466
. . .and put it on your key chain.

861
01:22:41,236 --> 01:22:45,707
Baby, I am so sorry
for having to put you through this.

862
01:22:46,276 --> 01:22:48,426
It was the only thing I could do.

863
01:22:48,956 --> 01:22:50,628
Can you ever forgive me?

864
01:22:51,236 --> 01:22:53,306
Honey, I already have.

865
01:23:00,436 --> 01:23:02,631
We have to go to the police.

866
01:23:04,996 --> 01:23:08,306
I don't know if this is the time
for brutal honesty.

867
01:23:08,596 --> 01:23:10,188
I've tampered with evidence. . .

868
01:23:10,436 --> 01:23:11,755
. . .in a homicide.

869
01:23:11,996 --> 01:23:14,669
I paid off a blackmail.
I'm in over my head and so are you.

870
01:23:14,916 --> 01:23:18,829
Think it through!
David could say anything he wants.

871
01:23:19,076 --> 01:23:21,067
He could say that
I hired him to kill you.

872
01:23:21,476 --> 01:23:24,274
Or that he blackmailed us,
the happy, wealthy couple.

873
01:23:24,516 --> 01:23:26,950
It'd appear we killed that poor
bastard, thinking it was David.

874
01:23:27,196 --> 01:23:29,073
It depends on how he plays it.

875
01:23:29,316 --> 01:23:30,795
What about the man that I killed?

876
01:23:32,436 --> 01:23:33,789
That has to do with David?

877
01:23:34,036 --> 01:23:35,435
Well, it must!

878
01:23:35,836 --> 01:23:40,466
Do you have any idea how many
burglaries there are each day?

879
01:23:40,996 --> 01:23:42,509
I don't think so.

880
01:23:46,876 --> 01:23:48,389
What are we going to do now?

881
01:23:49,116 --> 01:23:53,075
We'll have to disentangle ourselves
from your artist friend.

882
01:23:54,676 --> 01:23:57,429
Is there anything in his loft that
could link David to us?

883
01:23:59,836 --> 01:24:01,269
My ring.

884
01:24:01,556 --> 01:24:03,194
You said it was being repaired.

885
01:24:04,476 --> 01:24:06,785
That was a lie.
I left it by the bed.

886
01:24:09,756 --> 01:24:10,791
Anything else?

887
01:24:11,676 --> 01:24:13,587
Isn't that enough?

888
01:24:16,036 --> 01:24:17,389
I'll get it.

889
01:24:34,076 --> 01:24:36,590
Will you be home when I get back?

890
01:24:37,236 --> 01:24:38,669
Yes.

891
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:49,504
I'm on my way.

892
01:25:49,756 --> 01:25:52,429
I'm calling for Mr. David Shaw.

893
01:25:52,676 --> 01:25:54,189
Speaking.

894
01:25:54,436 --> 01:25:58,588
It's Truman Travel, confirming
your reservation for this afternoon.

895
01:25:58,876 --> 01:26:00,104
Thank you.

896
01:26:19,596 --> 01:26:20,585
Excuse me, sir.

897
01:26:20,916 --> 01:26:22,474
Could you spare 400 grand?

898
01:26:22,756 --> 01:26:24,428
I don't see why not.

899
01:26:30,076 --> 01:26:32,032
Don't think I won't count it.

900
01:26:32,236 --> 01:26:33,555
Naturally.

901
01:26:36,196 --> 01:26:38,710
Think of that
as your commemorative copy.

902
01:26:46,636 --> 01:26:49,025
Nice doing business with you, Steve.

903
01:26:53,756 --> 01:26:54,950
You take care.

904
01:28:10,556 --> 01:28:13,912
Last call: boarding
train number 32 for Montreal. ..

905
01:28:14,156 --> 01:28:16,590
...departing on track number 16.
All aboard.

906
01:28:25,116 --> 01:28:26,185
Right this way.

907
01:28:33,716 --> 01:28:35,229
Here we are, sir.

908
01:28:38,636 --> 01:28:39,989
Thank you, sir.

909
01:29:21,956 --> 01:29:24,595
Wanted to let you know
the dining car opens at 7.

910
01:29:24,876 --> 01:29:26,389
Closes at 1 0 sharp.

911
01:29:33,956 --> 01:29:35,787
Okay, everything's fine.

912
01:29:49,156 --> 01:29:50,748
Attention, please.

913
01:29:51,036 --> 01:29:55,826
Last call for train 32
departing to Montreal in 4 minutes.

914
01:30:08,076 --> 01:30:10,465
How's that for wet work?

915
01:30:13,836 --> 01:30:15,554
You should thank me.

916
01:30:15,836 --> 01:30:19,226
Artists are always appreciated
more after they're dead.

917
01:30:27,316 --> 01:30:28,544
You lose.

918
01:30:29,476 --> 01:30:31,751
I'm sorry, you got to speak up.
I can't hear you.

919
01:30:32,916 --> 01:30:33,905
You're dying.

920
01:30:41,396 --> 01:30:42,146
Steven's. . .

921
01:30:42,476 --> 01:30:44,034
. . .greatest hits.

922
01:31:09,996 --> 01:31:12,032
Excuse me.
I got an emergency here.

923
01:31:12,276 --> 01:31:13,106
What are you doing?

924
01:31:13,396 --> 01:31:15,785
-This'll make it easier.
-Be my guest!

925
01:31:16,716 --> 01:31:18,274
91 st and Fifth.

926
01:31:26,676 --> 01:31:28,906
Has there been a delivery today?

927
01:31:29,116 --> 01:31:32,995
Just one. It came by messenger,
Your wife took it up with the mail.

928
01:32:53,156 --> 01:32:54,305
I didn't know you were here.

929
01:32:54,756 --> 01:32:56,474
I was out on the terrace.

930
01:33:09,716 --> 01:33:11,434
Welcome home.

931
01:33:18,076 --> 01:33:20,465
It's time for a new start.

932
01:33:22,436 --> 01:33:25,951
What do you say we go out
for dinner this evening?

933
01:33:26,236 --> 01:33:29,228
Just the two of us,
someplace quiet. . .

934
01:33:29,716 --> 01:33:31,308
. . .in the neighborhood.

935
01:33:31,796 --> 01:33:32,831
Like that?

936
01:33:34,836 --> 01:33:37,270
I'll be right back.
I'm going to clean up.

937
01:35:13,156 --> 01:35:13,906
Honey?

938
01:35:15,636 --> 01:35:19,106
Let's stay home tonight.
I'll go pick up something to eat.

939
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:24,389
That's sweet of you.
Just don't be too long.

940
01:35:24,956 --> 01:35:25,945
I won't.

941
01:35:28,436 --> 01:35:32,031
Before I forget, I think
we should have the locks changed.

942
01:35:40,316 --> 01:35:41,271
Why?

943
01:35:41,996 --> 01:35:44,305
Because I still can't find my key.

944
01:35:48,076 --> 01:35:51,432
Good idea. I'll call
the locksmith in the morning.

945
01:35:51,876 --> 01:35:53,832
Better be safe than sorry.

946
01:35:54,116 --> 01:35:55,310
Thanks.

947
01:35:56,836 --> 01:35:58,792
See you soon. Hurry back.

948
01:36:34,636 --> 01:36:36,627
Must have put it back on his way in.

949
01:36:38,076 --> 01:36:40,067
Didn't plan on that, did you?

950
01:36:47,636 --> 01:36:48,989
Young David. . .

951
01:36:50,036 --> 01:36:51,594
. . .he was very unpredictable.

952
01:36:52,436 --> 01:36:54,313
Maybe you'll share a cell.

953
01:36:55,716 --> 01:36:56,944
Why?

954
01:36:57,716 --> 01:36:59,115
Because of this?

955
01:37:01,436 --> 01:37:03,506
I just found the key you lost.

956
01:37:03,836 --> 01:37:05,474
You left it for him.

957
01:37:06,556 --> 01:37:07,750
You mean the man you killed.

958
01:37:07,996 --> 01:37:10,146
-I never met the gentleman.
-David did.

959
01:37:10,396 --> 01:37:12,705
They'll have a hard time
proving I knew David.

960
01:37:12,996 --> 01:37:15,146
The blackmail proves it.

961
01:37:15,356 --> 01:37:16,391
What blackmail?

962
01:37:16,996 --> 01:37:18,270
There's only one letter. . .

963
01:37:18,516 --> 01:37:20,427
. . .and I'm afraid that's vanished.

964
01:37:22,276 --> 01:37:24,744
The thing is, we're just
another married couple. . .

965
01:37:24,996 --> 01:37:26,907
. . .trying to work things out.

966
01:37:27,836 --> 01:37:28,985
Work it out?

967
01:37:30,116 --> 01:37:31,390
Work it out?

968
01:37:33,196 --> 01:37:36,074
Because that's what she does
on nights that I play cards.

969
01:37:36,356 --> 01:37:38,472
Like the combination to the safe?

970
01:37:38,756 --> 01:37:40,030
It's our wedding day, Steven.

971
01:37:41,556 --> 01:37:45,071
You work it out on your fucking own!
This is over!

972
01:37:50,036 --> 01:37:52,186
I'll tell you when it's over.

973
01:38:12,236 --> 01:38:14,670
The only way you leave me
is dead.

974
01:39:11,476 --> 01:39:16,186
I always thought that "bludgeon"
had a spur-of-the-moment sound.

975
01:39:17,236 --> 01:39:19,750
Maybe you could use one of these.

976
01:39:22,116 --> 01:39:24,505
Rifle the jewelry in the bedroom.

977
01:39:24,796 --> 01:39:28,186
Disable the service entrance lock.
Make it look like it was jimmied.

978
01:39:28,676 --> 01:39:30,234
Put the key back under the pipe...

979
01:39:30,476 --> 01:39:32,467
... then leave
the same way you came in.

980
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:36,236
And what happens
if the plan goes to hell?

981
01:39:38,356 --> 01:39:39,755
It won 't.

982
01:39:50,036 --> 01:39:51,754
He said he was going to kill me.

983
01:39:52,756 --> 01:39:54,553
So I tried to run.

984
01:39:55,556 --> 01:39:57,148
And then he attacked you?

985
01:39:59,996 --> 01:40:01,111
Yes.

986
01:40:04,116 --> 01:40:05,868
What else could you do?

987
01:40:12,156 --> 01:40:14,989
May God be with you.

988
01:40:15,956 --> 01:40:17,992
And you as well.

989
01:42:58,196 --> 01:42:59,185
Subtitled by:
GELULA & CO., INC.

990
01:43:44,012 --> 01:43:45,525
Who is this?

991
01:43:46,812 --> 01:43:49,326
He must have put it back
on his way in.

992
01:43:51,612 --> 01:43:53,330
You didn't plan on that,
did you?

993
01:43:57,092 --> 01:44:00,004
Young David was
very unpredictable.

994
01:44:00,692 --> 01:44:03,206
Well, maybe you'll share a cell.

995
01:44:03,692 --> 01:44:04,807
Why?

996
01:44:05,692 --> 01:44:07,648
Because of this?

997
01:44:08,612 --> 01:44:10,284
I just found the key
that you lost.

998
01:44:12,692 --> 01:44:14,364
You left it for him.

999
01:44:14,812 --> 01:44:17,406
You mean the man that you killed?

1000
01:44:17,732 --> 01:44:20,200
Sorry.
I never met the gentleman.

1001
01:44:20,812 --> 01:44:22,006
David did.

1002
01:44:22,612 --> 01:44:26,400
I think you'll have a hard time
proving I even knew David.

1003
01:44:28,612 --> 01:44:29,806
The fact is, Emily. . .

1004
01:44:30,092 --> 01:44:32,686
. . .you and I are just another
married couple. . .

1005
01:44:33,012 --> 01:44:35,685
. . .trying to work things out.

1006
01:44:37,692 --> 01:44:39,011
Work it out.

1007
01:44:40,372 --> 01:44:41,805
Work it out.

1008
01:44:42,492 --> 01:44:45,290
You mean like the
combination to the safe?

1009
01:44:46,772 --> 01:44:48,683
It's our wedding day, Steven.

1010
01:44:51,212 --> 01:44:54,409
Because that's what she does
on nights that I play cards.

1011
01:44:54,692 --> 01:44:56,125
You can work it out. . .

1012
01:44:56,572 --> 01:44:58,608
. . .on your fucking own!

1013
01:44:58,892 --> 01:45:00,166
This is over.

1014
01:45:03,012 --> 01:45:05,207
I'll tell you when it's over.

1015
01:45:06,092 --> 01:45:08,686
Because the only way
you're going to leave me. . .

1016
01:45:09,572 --> 01:45:11,210
. . .is dead.

1017
01:45:27,412 --> 01:45:29,801
You'll never. . .

1018
01:45:30,172 --> 01:45:32,288
. . .get away with it.

1019
01:46:24,372 --> 01:46:25,202
You know something, Mo?

1020
01:46:25,492 --> 01:46:27,005
Not now, Bobby.

1021
01:46:33,052 --> 01:46:34,371
I always thought that...

1022
01:46:34,612 --> 01:46:38,002
... "bludgeon" had
a spur-of-the-moment sound.

1023
01:46:38,292 --> 01:46:41,409
Maybe you can use one of these.

1024
01:46:43,612 --> 01:46:46,001
Rifle the jewelry in the bedroom.

1025
01:46:46,292 --> 01:46:49,807
Disable the service entrance lock.
Make it look like it was jimmied.

1026
01:46:50,092 --> 01:46:51,764
Put the key back under the pipe...

1027
01:46:52,012 --> 01:46:54,401
... then leave
the same way you came in.

1028
01:46:55,212 --> 01:46:58,124
And what happens
if the plan goes to hell?

1029
01:46:59,892 --> 01:47:01,610
It won 't.

1030
01:47:09,252 --> 01:47:11,208
I didn't hear him come in.

1031
01:47:12,052 --> 01:47:14,407
Why, because you were
listening to the tape?

1032
01:47:20,172 --> 01:47:21,810
And then he attacked you?

1033
01:47:22,212 --> 01:47:25,488
He said he was going to kill me.

1034
01:47:25,772 --> 01:47:27,524
So I tried to run.

1035
01:47:27,892 --> 01:47:29,610
Out the service entrance?

1036
01:47:31,572 --> 01:47:34,006
And then he grabbed me by my hair.

1037
01:47:36,092 --> 01:47:38,606
And shoved me into the counter.

1038
01:47:40,012 --> 01:47:42,731
I crawled away
and got to my feet.

1039
01:47:43,852 --> 01:47:45,251
And shot him.

1040
01:47:57,972 --> 01:47:59,769
What else could you do?

1041
01:48:05,052 --> 01:48:06,121
May God be with you.

1042
01:48:09,212 --> 01:48:11,407
And you, as well.

1043
01:48:21,619 --> 01:48:24,338
This is Andy Davis,
the director of A Perfect Murder.

1044
01:48:24,539 --> 01:48:27,337
I want to welcome you
to our DVD commentary.

1045
01:48:27,579 --> 01:48:30,969
You're about to see a variation
on the ending which we tried...

1046
01:48:31,219 --> 01:48:34,256
...as an alternative
to the perfect murder.

1047
01:48:35,859 --> 01:48:39,249
We felt the ending was powerful
and strong. And yet...

1048
01:48:39,539 --> 01:48:41,928
... there was something about
the smartness of this movie...

1049
01:48:42,219 --> 01:48:44,335
...and the character of Michael.

1050
01:48:44,619 --> 01:48:48,009
We felt maybe he shouldn 't
resort to violence with his wife.

1051
01:48:48,259 --> 01:48:51,854
He's been able to talk himself
out of everything all along.

1052
01:48:52,139 --> 01:48:55,051
So we tried an ending where,
basically...

1053
01:48:55,339 --> 01:48:59,218
... Gwyneth questions him about
the key, leaves the apartment...

1054
01:48:59,459 --> 01:49:02,417
...and Michael goes to the back door
to retrieve the key.

1055
01:49:02,659 --> 01:49:04,650
As he comes back in,
the phone rings.

1056
01:49:04,939 --> 01:49:07,499
The famous phone
in the kitchen rings.

1057
01:49:07,939 --> 01:49:10,737
And he knows she's playing with him.
Somebody is playing with him.

1058
01:49:11,019 --> 01:49:14,614
He picks up the phone,
and the same scene that we have now...

1059
01:49:14,859 --> 01:49:17,498
...is played in the kitchen,
where she confronts him.

1060
01:49:43,339 --> 01:49:46,729
The reason we decided to stay
with the ending we have now is:

1061
01:49:48,019 --> 01:49:49,816
Both endings tested highly...

1062
01:49:50,059 --> 01:49:53,256
...but the ending we have now
gave Gwyneth a more moral base.

1063
01:49:53,539 --> 01:49:56,053
She did not demean herself
by acting...

1064
01:49:56,339 --> 01:50:01,015
...in a heinous way like the men
who she had been a part of.

1065
01:50:01,259 --> 01:50:04,057
There was a greater feeling
of warmth towards her at the end...

1066
01:50:04,299 --> 01:50:05,937
...by her being justified...

1067
01:50:06,179 --> 01:50:09,251
...and doing what she did because
of her husband's attack.

1068
01:50:24,939 --> 01:50:27,055
Instead of him throwing her around...

1069
01:50:27,299 --> 01:50:30,655
...Michael says, "The only way
you'll leave me is dead. "

1070
01:50:30,899 --> 01:50:32,332
Before he has a chance to blink...

1071
01:50:32,619 --> 01:50:34,450
...she shoots him cold in the kitchen.

1072
01:50:35,139 --> 01:50:37,653
Bang! Falls to the floor.

1073
01:50:39,899 --> 01:50:41,810
He looks up and says...

1074
01:50:45,539 --> 01:50:49,418
... "You'll never get away with it. "

1075
01:50:49,659 --> 01:50:53,049
She looks up at the pots
and pans above her...

1076
01:50:58,819 --> 01:50:59,649
... tips her head back...

1077
01:50:59,899 --> 01:51:02,459
...and whacks her head
against the countertop.

1078
01:51:02,859 --> 01:51:06,056
We cut.
The cops are in the kitchen.

1079
01:51:17,899 --> 01:51:21,608
The place is a mess.
She has destroyed the kitchen...

1080
01:51:21,859 --> 01:51:25,738
...made it look like a huge battle.
She is manipulating him.

1081
01:51:25,979 --> 01:51:28,015
She's now committing
the perfect murder.

1082
01:51:28,459 --> 01:51:29,608
The cops walk in.

1083
01:51:29,859 --> 01:51:31,850
David Suchet, "Detective Karaman"...

1084
01:51:32,099 --> 01:51:34,329
... with his partner, Bobby Fain.

1085
01:51:34,619 --> 01:51:38,453
And he smells a rat.
Something strange is going on here.

1086
01:51:38,739 --> 01:51:42,857
He walks through the kitchen,
Michael's body is taken away.

1087
01:51:43,139 --> 01:51:45,573
It's very much like the
intruder's scene we had before.

1088
01:51:45,819 --> 01:51:49,050
And he goes into the office
and the tape is playing...

1089
01:51:49,299 --> 01:51:53,133
... with Michael laying out
the plan of the murder.

1090
01:52:20,859 --> 01:52:24,249
He shuts it off, and Gwyneth
basically lies to him.

1091
01:52:24,499 --> 01:52:27,969
And she fabricates this attack
that never happened.

1092
01:53:01,699 --> 01:53:03,451
The cop listens for a while...

1093
01:53:03,699 --> 01:53:07,248
...makes a moral decision:
I don 't care what happened...

1094
01:53:07,539 --> 01:53:09,848
... this man deserved to die.

1095
01:53:10,139 --> 01:53:12,653
He deserved what he got.

1096
01:53:12,939 --> 01:53:14,657
He goes along with her and says...

1097
01:53:14,939 --> 01:53:16,691
... "What else could you do?"

1098
01:53:17,739 --> 01:53:19,138
And the movie ends.
