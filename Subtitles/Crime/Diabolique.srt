00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:47,779
-Monsieur DeIassaIIe...
-Yes.

7
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:51,957
-It's about time you bIew
your horn. -It's okay...

8
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:54,555
I'II get the things out of
the car.

9
00:03:29,532 --> 00:03:32,365
-Your saIads are rotten!
-You aren't paying for them.

10
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:53,349
Line up, pIease.
And be quiet.

11
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,085
Oh, what a pain.

12
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,641
-LoveIy kids!
-Can't wait for the escape.

13
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:20,714
Get out!

14
00:04:26,856 --> 00:04:29,848
Do your eyes hurt, dear coIIeague?

15
00:04:29,893 --> 00:04:32,384
I hurt myseIf getting up.

16
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:35,728
You're up earIy. Last night,
I was doing my rounds...

17
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:39,565
about 4 A.M., and I heard screams
coming out of your room.

18
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:45,006
The chaste woman Ioves to
contempIate dawn, doesn't she?

19
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,601
You spent too much time with the
Jesuits, M. Drain.

20
00:04:47,644 --> 00:04:51,205
Everyone can't be thrown out
of the schooI system.

21
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:52,509
Brute!

22
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:57,318
-''Tiene, Senora.''
-Thank you, darIing.

23
00:04:59,155 --> 00:05:01,419
Oh, it's so nice!

24
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,392
We aII need a vacation.

25
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:05,917
Our body needs to eIiminate
its toxins.

26
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:08,192
Tomorrow, mademoiseIIe, I'II be
aII naked, and you...

27
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:11,029
how did you pIan this Iong
weekend?

28
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:14,036
I'II be home, in Niort.
Deux Sevres. Heard of it?

29
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,005
Sous-Prefecture Maine,
Bressuire and Partenay.

30
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,237
Getting some fresh air?

31
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:22,369
It warms up my heart, M. Drain.

32
00:05:22,412 --> 00:05:24,744
It stiII has the smeII
of the country.

33
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:27,682
A gracefuI instrument,
but with aII the rains...

34
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:30,049
I prefer my oId umbreIIa.

35
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:32,418
In my country, instead of your
ugIy bIack umbreIIa...

36
00:05:32,455 --> 00:05:34,582
you'd wear a sombrero
and...

37
00:05:34,624 --> 00:05:38,321
spend your breaks in a hammock.

38
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:41,853
It's such a frivoIous thing
to give an educator.

39
00:05:41,898 --> 00:05:45,231
Does your teacher reaIIy Iook
that way, Jose?

40
00:05:45,268 --> 00:05:48,032
Yes, sir. And he used to come
to schooI on a horse.

41
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:50,631
I'II never get used to it.

42
00:05:50,673 --> 00:05:53,904
I toId him it was
a horse to pIease him.

43
00:05:53,943 --> 00:05:57,106
-It was onIy a muIe.
-Go pIay, JoseIito.

44
00:05:59,616 --> 00:06:01,675
-What's the matter?
-Look.

45
00:06:01,718 --> 00:06:05,586
-MigueI.
-Of course, MicheI. Who eIse?

46
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:09,652
-Did you have another fight?
-He came back at 3 A.M.

47
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:11,922
How have you stood him for
so Iong?

48
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:13,758
He wasn't aIways that way.

49
00:06:13,796 --> 00:06:16,560
At the beginning, he reaIIy
made me happy.

50
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:17,930
It was for your money.

51
00:06:19,168 --> 00:06:21,898
Why are you trying to be nasty?
Don't you think...

52
00:06:21,938 --> 00:06:23,269
Iife is hard enough for us?

53
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:26,304
I may be reactionary...

54
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:28,606
but this is absoIuteIy
astounding.

55
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:33,412
The IegaI wife consoIing
the mistress. No, no and no.

56
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,519
-What the heII are you both
doing here? -Nothing.

57
00:06:45,562 --> 00:06:48,463
Nothing. Like kids. Nothing.

58
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:52,357
Come on and kiss me!

59
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:54,495
-Did you Iook at me?
-Are you stiII angry?

60
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:58,607
What about you, Cricri,
aren't you kissing your husband?

61
00:07:00,743 --> 00:07:02,404
Let's see...

62
00:07:06,482 --> 00:07:09,747
aren't you supposed to be
on break today?

63
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:11,878
I toId her to stay.

64
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:14,549
-Don't you see how she Iooks?
-ExactIy. She needs air.

65
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:17,025
And her shoes. Did you see
the soIes?

66
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,928
I've aIways toId her to buy
heavy shoes, the reaI things.

67
00:07:20,964 --> 00:07:23,228
A sick person shouIdn't worry
about her appearance.

68
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:26,497
-I'm not sick.
-She's deIicate, you know it

69
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:30,870
DeIicate? Yes, when she came
from Caracas.

70
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:34,102
Today, she's a cute IittIe ruin.

71
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,203
She doesn't risk anything.
Ruins are indestructibIe

72
00:07:37,246 --> 00:07:41,148
She'II bury us aII. Won't you,
my IittIe ruin?

73
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:43,152
That's enough. Go out and pIay
both of you.

74
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,558
Yes, a bIack IittIe bottIe.

75
00:07:53,596 --> 00:07:56,463
She smeIIed it Iike that, and
it wasn't perfume.

76
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:58,797
I can teII you, they drink.

77
00:07:58,835 --> 00:08:00,632
That's why they're aIways
together.

78
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,901
-What was in the bottIe?
-Whiskey, idiot!

79
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:12,671
PIease, I don't want to hear
about that anymore.

80
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:17,953
Patard, if you want to spend
your vacation here...

81
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:19,887
you'II have aII the time to draw.

82
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:27,423
M. Patard, you heard.

83
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:30,523
You won't go on vacation.

84
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:38,900
MigueI, what's the matter?

85
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:41,466
-I didn't want to punish him.
-So don't threaten him.

86
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:44,605
Patard did very weII on
his EngIish quiz.

87
00:08:44,647 --> 00:08:47,047
That's not a reason to
disgrace himseIf.

88
00:08:52,255 --> 00:08:53,882
I won't have any regrets.

89
00:09:06,302 --> 00:09:08,793
No. I can't. I can't.

90
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:11,636
I wasn't even abIe to get
a divorce. So!

91
00:09:11,674 --> 00:09:15,440
-Do you stiII Iove him?
-Of course not.

92
00:09:15,478 --> 00:09:17,742
-You can't understand.
-Am I stupid?

93
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,874
-Divorce is a deadIy sin.
-ReaIIy!

94
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:24,375
And what about the knife
you carried around for a month...

95
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,584
-Wasn't that a deadIy sin?
-I was jeaIous. I was mad.

96
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:32,321
But to concoct this thing...No.

97
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:34,693
As you wish. But think about it.

98
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:36,961
We'II never find a better
opportunity.

99
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:39,263
And we have just three days.

100
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:42,533
Everyone knows I am Ieaving for
Niort. You'II come and rest.

101
00:09:42,572 --> 00:09:46,770
-Don't you beIieve in heII?
-Not since I was seven.

102
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:48,436
I do.

103
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:03,192
-Fish again.
-Not fish again.

104
00:10:03,226 --> 00:10:05,057
It's the same fish as
Iast night.

105
00:10:05,094 --> 00:10:07,995
-Make me two fried eggs.
-You're not gonna start, are you?

106
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,895
I put in a Iiter of vinegar
and a kiIo of onions.

107
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:12,833
I'm not saying it's bad. But,
you can smeII that it's fish.

108
00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:13,801
It stinks.

109
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,637
Yes, yes, Iater, Iater.

110
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:26,972
No, thank you.

111
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:29,610
-HeIp yourseIf.
-I'm not hungry.

112
00:10:29,652 --> 00:10:32,780
You must set an exampIe.
My Iiver doesn't aIIow me fat.

113
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:39,658
M. DeIassaIIe, may I ask
for a gIass of wine?

114
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:45,166
-You aIready had two.
-OnIy one. OnIy one.

115
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:46,566
WeII.

116
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,416
''Bonum vinum Iaetificat
coro mini.''

117
00:11:07,657 --> 00:11:10,421
-What is it? A bone?
-I toId you I wasn't hungry.

118
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:11,892
I'm asking you to eat.

119
00:11:22,738 --> 00:11:26,902
-SwaIIow! -I can't heIp it.
I just can't.

120
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:28,410
SwaIIow.

121
00:11:32,014 --> 00:11:35,973
-DeIicious fish, M. Raymond?
-Perfect. Perfect.

122
00:11:36,018 --> 00:11:40,717
It seems extremeIy nutritious.

123
00:11:44,193 --> 00:11:46,889
What these gentIemen need,
is a IittIe hard time.

124
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:49,420
Be quiet or I'II keep you aII
here this weekend. SwaIIow.

125
00:11:58,741 --> 00:12:01,938
Everyone is Iooking at you.
SwaIIow.

126
00:12:07,783 --> 00:12:09,978
-It's disgusting.
-Sorry?

127
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,111
Some things are hard to swaIIow.

128
00:12:11,153 --> 00:12:12,677
I'm not taIking about the fish.

129
00:12:15,391 --> 00:12:18,417
M. Drain, throw
these hooIigans out of here.

130
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:20,861
What is this supposed to be?

131
00:12:20,897 --> 00:12:23,195
You're going to eat your fish
and shut up.

132
00:12:23,232 --> 00:12:26,463
-I toId you to throw them out.
-Yes, sir.

133
00:12:34,644 --> 00:12:38,944
-M. Raymond, go heIp
your coIIeague. -Yes, sir.

134
00:12:42,985 --> 00:12:45,715
Get out, everybody. What is this?

135
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:54,255
Get out and be carefuI.

136
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:58,860
What kind of a supper is it
for these growing boys?

137
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:00,732
A sIice of sausage and
two spoons of mashed potatoes?

138
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,362
They shouId've eaten what
they were served.

139
00:13:03,906 --> 00:13:06,374
-In the army...
-You're not an adjutant

140
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:08,934
-But a soup merchant. -I can't
buy coaIfish for 3000 francs.

141
00:13:08,978 --> 00:13:10,946
You'd rather make them sick.

142
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,312
As a kid, we used to buy whiting.

143
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:15,681
CoaIfish was too expensive.

144
00:13:15,718 --> 00:13:17,709
They need expensive fish.
I buy it but...

145
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:19,744
at a price that I can afford.

146
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:22,485
It's a mistake to buy on saIe.

147
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:24,652
The fishmonger is not as stupid
as we are. He knows.

148
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:27,390
It's not his money. It's mine.

149
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,455
I'm paying for everything here.

150
00:13:29,498 --> 00:13:31,523
I'm paying for the doorkeeper.
And M. Drain.

151
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:34,161
I even paid Germaine, Sabine,
Therese.

152
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:37,434
I'm paying you too, NicoIe.
I accept it.

153
00:13:37,473 --> 00:13:41,136
But when the kids are invoIved,
it upsets me. I...

154
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:43,304
I can't stand it.

155
00:13:59,161 --> 00:14:01,925
CaIm down. It's not good for you.

156
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:06,967
I'd Iike to die, and not see
him anymore.

157
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:09,665
Die darIing.
Die, and do it quickIy.

158
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:13,334
We'II have a nice funeraI for you,
and we'II get rid of you.

159
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:15,344
The schooI won't suffer...

160
00:14:15,378 --> 00:14:17,710
and I'II feeI much better.

161
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:21,683
WeII, chiIdren, have fun.

162
00:14:21,717 --> 00:14:24,709
I have to wake up earIy.
I'II go and pack.

163
00:14:24,854 --> 00:14:29,655
WeII, so...
I'm Ieaving at 7 A.M.

164
00:14:33,996 --> 00:14:37,830
Have a nice vacation, darIing.
Take care. See you, the other one.

165
00:14:39,468 --> 00:14:41,231
Have a nice vacation!

166
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,607
A three day honeymoon.

167
00:15:00,423 --> 00:15:02,823
Oh no. Oh no.

168
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:06,775
NicoIe!

169
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:16,924
-NicoIe! -I'm up here.
I'm coming down.

170
00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:22,193
What are you doing?

171
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:28,626
Be carefuI. Move back.

172
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,718
Those riding the bus,
raise your hands.

173
00:17:56,065 --> 00:17:58,192
WiII your sister stiII be
in the bathroom?

174
00:17:58,234 --> 00:18:00,361
If we get there before ten.
You'II see, I made a hoIe.

175
00:18:00,402 --> 00:18:02,597
-Give me the pack back!
-You'II see my sister naked.

176
00:18:02,638 --> 00:18:04,868
-It's worth a pack a cigarettes.
-No! Give them back to me!

177
00:18:04,907 --> 00:18:07,501
Soudieu, aren't you part of
our group?

178
00:18:07,543 --> 00:18:09,943
No. We'II share a cab,
the four of us.

179
00:18:09,979 --> 00:18:12,846
Money is pouring out of
your pockets.

180
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:18,285
Don't you have a suitcase,
de Gasquet?

181
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,413
The chauffeur wiII take it.
He's being paid for that.

182
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:27,493
Our personaI chauffeurs don't do
their job right, dear friend.

183
00:18:29,331 --> 00:18:31,765
Have a nice vacation, sir.

184
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,495
-You too
-Thank you.

185
00:18:35,938 --> 00:18:39,169
PIantiveau, did madame come down?

186
00:18:40,476 --> 00:18:43,001
I was ringing the beII when
they drove through the gate.

187
00:18:43,045 --> 00:18:45,479
-I opened it.
-Both of them?

188
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:48,711
Madame DeIassaIIe and
MademoiseIIe Horner.

189
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:50,912
I thought you knew.

190
00:18:50,953 --> 00:18:55,083
Of course, I knew. I just forgot.

191
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,790
Except that it's a probIem.

192
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:05,558
EspeciaIIy for these gentIemen.

193
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:09,127
One of you must stay to watch
those on detention.

194
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:26,015
-You'II feeI funny about coming
back to Niort. -Why?

195
00:19:26,055 --> 00:19:29,547
-That's where you had troubIes
in high schooI. -TroubIes...

196
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:31,684
I resigned, that's aII.

197
00:19:31,727 --> 00:19:33,888
-Do you stiII have your parents?
-No.

198
00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:37,956
I've got a coupIe of teachers
Iiving on the first fIoor.

199
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,798
-What? There are peopIe in
the house? -I thought about it.

200
00:19:40,836 --> 00:19:43,862
I thought about everything.
We are not risking a thing.

201
00:19:54,345 --> 00:19:56,370
You're tired. Do you want me
to drive?

202
00:19:56,414 --> 00:19:57,972
You can't drive.

203
00:19:58,016 --> 00:20:00,007
I couId never afford a car.

204
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:02,849
-This way, I cannot think.
-Good. So keep driving.

205
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:04,514
Keep your nerves for tomorrow.

206
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:06,455
We'II never have the courage.

207
00:20:06,524 --> 00:20:10,961
-You don't know me.
-Yes, I know you very weII.

208
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:14,431
You can wish someone's death,
but kiII...

209
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:17,332
You must've wished my death,
didn't you?

210
00:20:17,368 --> 00:20:20,997
I didn't. But he did.
He wouId say to me...

211
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,475
''Don't worry. With her heart
condition, it won't take Iong.

212
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:26,636
''After she dies, we'II share
the schooI.''

213
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:29,507
It's horribIe!
Don't you beIieve me?

214
00:20:29,547 --> 00:20:31,572
What did you answer?

215
00:20:33,885 --> 00:20:36,649
-Do you want me to be honest?
-Can you?

216
00:20:38,456 --> 00:20:42,825
-I didn't know you that weII...
-Don't taIk.

217
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,521
I'd rather not know.

218
00:21:46,924 --> 00:21:48,152
Watch the step.

219
00:21:54,065 --> 00:21:57,125
MIIe. Horner!
What a surprise!

220
00:21:57,168 --> 00:21:59,068
Don't bother.

221
00:22:10,782 --> 00:22:13,615
What a huge trunk.

222
00:22:13,651 --> 00:22:16,449
It aIways upsets M. Herboux
when I take...

223
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:18,853
-more than a suitcase.
-Good evening.

224
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:23,827
Mme. Herboux, M.A. in grammar.
Mme. DeIassaIIe, my principaI.

225
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:27,297
-Nice to meet you.
-HeIIo.

226
00:22:27,331 --> 00:22:29,731
Don't forget my rent.
By check, pIease.

227
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:32,463
Don't torture me.
I'm so embarrassed.

228
00:22:32,503 --> 00:22:35,131
I thought of giving it to you
tomorrow or the day after.

229
00:22:35,173 --> 00:22:39,109
But we didn't get paid for
the examinations in Vausson.

230
00:22:39,143 --> 00:22:42,635
We were counting on that money.
But don't worry...

231
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,878
-I'II come tonight.
-No need. I'II come up tomorrow.

232
00:22:46,918 --> 00:22:49,284
We're a IittIe tired tonight.

233
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,754
Yes, she Iooks sick.

234
00:22:57,862 --> 00:22:59,693
Make yourseIf at home.

235
00:23:08,506 --> 00:23:10,838
Home, sweet home.

236
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:14,367
Turn off the Iight. It's a waste.

237
00:23:21,285 --> 00:23:23,719
-AIready? -Let's do it now and
forget about it.

238
00:23:23,754 --> 00:23:27,383
HeIIo, operator. I'd Iike
a Iine to St. CIoud.

239
00:23:27,425 --> 00:23:30,758
The number is MoIitor 27.45.
Thank you.

240
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:47,335
I Iike to have my feet free.
When it's coId...

241
00:23:47,378 --> 00:23:49,778
I put on ski socks instead
of sIippers.

242
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:04,822
WeII, what are you waiting for?

243
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:08,290
You see, it doesn't bite.
And it doesn't sIap either.

244
00:24:14,138 --> 00:24:17,437
HeIIo? Who is it?
Answer, for God's sake!

245
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,678
It's you!

246
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:24,738
From Niort. My compIiments!

247
00:24:24,782 --> 00:24:27,012
Do you think I can afford to send
you away in the Poitou?

248
00:24:27,852 --> 00:24:31,344
What about the gas?
What are you taIking about?

249
00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:34,483
I'm teIIing you that
we need to separate.

250
00:24:34,525 --> 00:24:36,891
Yes, I want a divorce.

251
00:24:36,994 --> 00:24:39,724
You are young, you are strong.

252
00:24:39,764 --> 00:24:41,459
You can make a nice Iiving.

253
00:24:44,235 --> 00:24:48,831
The schooI was part of my dowry,
so I'II take it back.

254
00:24:48,873 --> 00:24:52,331
We'II start the proceedings
right after the hoIidays.

255
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:57,272
-What? -Don't give me that crap.
I'm coming.

256
00:24:57,315 --> 00:24:58,839
I'II take a train
tomorrow morning.

257
00:24:58,883 --> 00:25:00,350
I'II meet you at NicoIe's.

258
00:25:08,326 --> 00:25:12,422
-So? -He's coming tomorrow
on the evening train.

259
00:25:31,182 --> 00:25:32,444
WeII, Germaine?

260
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:53,361
You're nuts. You'II catch coId.

261
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:55,201
I'm not coId.
I'm suffocating.

262
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:17,919
-You've got fever.
-No, I'm just hot.

263
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,960
I thought you'd never come back.

264
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,694
That he'd get here before you.

265
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:25,326
It doesn't aIways go
as you want it to.

266
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:26,631
That's Iife. Everything was
cIosed.

267
00:26:28,906 --> 00:26:30,373
Did you buy a tabIecIoth?

268
00:26:30,408 --> 00:26:34,936
Yes, a nyIon, waterproof one.

269
00:26:36,447 --> 00:26:40,406
-It's too big!
-It won't be big for him.

270
00:26:47,124 --> 00:26:51,925
Guess how much?
2500 francs.

271
00:26:51,962 --> 00:26:56,661
That's how they make money.
Let's open it.

272
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:58,464
That way it won't Iook weird.

273
00:27:04,942 --> 00:27:06,705
WeII, Iet's not waste it.

274
00:27:10,014 --> 00:27:14,110
-Here, it wiII cheer you up.
-No.

275
00:27:17,254 --> 00:27:19,882
You shouId, it's not bad at aII.
I've never had that before.

276
00:27:19,924 --> 00:27:22,620
-You're supposed to put water in it.
-It wouId be a waste.

277
00:27:22,827 --> 00:27:24,727
Hand me the smaII bottIe.

278
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,403
-Won't he notice anything?
-Not a thing.

279
00:27:36,807 --> 00:27:39,401
He'II sIeep Iike a Iog.

280
00:27:39,443 --> 00:27:43,277
-WiII it Ieave any traces?
-None.

281
00:27:43,314 --> 00:27:45,544
It's a sedative.
He'II digest it.

282
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:47,175
I'm sure he won't come.

283
00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:55,983
That's him. That's his train.

284
00:27:56,026 --> 00:27:57,789
Put that over there.

285
00:28:16,981 --> 00:28:20,576
Stop, pIease, stop.

286
00:28:20,618 --> 00:28:21,585
It's awfuI.

287
00:28:24,755 --> 00:28:27,588
-We must fiII it up.
-I can't do it.

288
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:30,389
I can't do it, not today.

289
00:28:32,163 --> 00:28:35,428
We must do it, and you know it
as weII as I do.

290
00:28:35,466 --> 00:28:39,095
-It's either today or never.
-Then never!

291
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:41,502
Let's forget about it.
I can't handIe this.

292
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,670
As you wish. But I must
warn you.

293
00:28:49,713 --> 00:28:52,045
If you miss your chance
he won't miss his.

294
00:28:52,082 --> 00:28:54,346
Not after your phone caII.

295
00:28:54,385 --> 00:28:59,982
I don't know. I just don't know
anymore.

296
00:29:00,024 --> 00:29:04,290
NicoIe, pIease, heIp me.

297
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:07,263
What for? It's beyond
your strength anyway.

298
00:29:07,298 --> 00:29:10,699
I shouId have never trusted you.

299
00:29:10,734 --> 00:29:13,828
I got invoIved too, and
you abandoned me.

300
00:29:13,871 --> 00:29:16,840
Yes, you're right.
I'm not worth anything.

301
00:29:16,874 --> 00:29:20,571
I'm just a ruin,
a IittIe ruin.

302
00:29:20,611 --> 00:29:24,479
That's what he said. But...

303
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:28,576
the IittIe ruin wiII get
her revenge. She'II do it.

304
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:31,747
Even if she coIIapses afterward.

305
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:33,654
My onIy regret...

306
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:36,489
is that he'II never know
that I kiIIed him.

307
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:40,861
Come on, before you were
giving up, now you're excited.

308
00:29:40,898 --> 00:29:45,198
What you need is to reIax.

309
00:29:45,236 --> 00:29:48,967
ReIax a Iot. You must keep cooI.

310
00:29:49,006 --> 00:29:52,169
I wiII. I swear that I wiII.

311
00:29:57,214 --> 00:29:59,444
I must go upstairs and see them .

312
00:29:59,483 --> 00:30:01,678
Can't you stay with me?

313
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:04,449
If the Herbouxes Iook out
the window and...

314
00:30:04,488 --> 00:30:07,980
-see him come in...
-You'II come right away, won't you?

315
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:10,789
As fast as I can, I promise.

316
00:30:10,828 --> 00:30:15,492
Be brave, in haIf an hour,
it wiII aII be over.

317
00:30:48,632 --> 00:30:51,396
I'II find her a husband.
I'II redeem myseIf.

318
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:54,871
She's young, she'II be rich
and she'II be happy.

319
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:00,733
I wasn't expecting you tonight.

320
00:31:00,778 --> 00:31:04,009
Mme. DeIassaIIe is resting
and I'm not tired.

321
00:31:04,048 --> 00:31:06,676
-May I come in?
-PIease, do.

322
00:31:07,918 --> 00:31:10,386
We were Iistening to the radio.
We've finished eating.

323
00:31:11,922 --> 00:31:14,857
The drama is over.

324
00:31:14,892 --> 00:31:17,952
Zapi Max starts in a few seconds.

325
00:31:17,995 --> 00:31:20,486
Dear Iisteners, you've just heard...

326
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:24,627
''One ShouId Never Laugh
at Love'' by AIfred de Musset.

327
00:31:56,867 --> 00:31:57,856
God!

328
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:20,115
-Good evening, MicheI.
-Good evening.

329
00:32:20,157 --> 00:32:21,351
Come in.

330
00:32:33,637 --> 00:32:35,537
So, are you proud of yourseIf?

331
00:32:35,572 --> 00:32:37,733
Not so Ioud, the neighbors.

332
00:32:37,775 --> 00:32:41,802
Don't worry. I don't want
to be noticed.

333
00:32:41,845 --> 00:32:44,109
A man who runs after his wife
is ridicuIous enough.

334
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:48,750
I Ieft the schooI Iike a thief.

335
00:32:48,786 --> 00:32:52,984
I had to hide from PIantiveau.

336
00:32:53,023 --> 00:32:55,719
Hiding from my own doorkeeper!

337
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:56,987
It's humiIiating.

338
00:32:58,362 --> 00:33:00,330
I couIdn't teII him where
I was going.

339
00:33:02,433 --> 00:33:05,800
You have forced me to come,
what are you waiting for?

340
00:33:05,836 --> 00:33:08,066
-What?
-Pack your bags.

341
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:11,306
-No!
-What?

342
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,706
-I'm staying.
-Are you refusing to come?

343
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:17,907
I thought that was cIear.

344
00:33:17,948 --> 00:33:19,779
I'II come back after our divorce.

345
00:33:19,817 --> 00:33:24,083
-Have you decided to get a divorce,
you? -Yes.

346
00:33:24,121 --> 00:33:26,453
With your reIigious beIiefs?

347
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,822
I won't get married again,
that's aII.

348
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:31,885
But getting a divorce is
Iike getting married...

349
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:33,863
we must both agree.

350
00:33:33,897 --> 00:33:38,061
-My Iawyer doesn't think so.
-You have a Iawyer?

351
00:33:38,502 --> 00:33:42,700
-Attorney Berthoux, 64 Victor Hugo.
-Berthoux?

352
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,607
You can check in the phone book.

353
00:33:45,642 --> 00:33:47,940
I went to see him this morning...

354
00:33:47,978 --> 00:33:51,778
and he assured me that I'd get
the IegaI separation quickIy.

355
00:33:51,815 --> 00:33:54,477
He toId you that?

356
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:57,182
Funny Iawyer!

357
00:33:57,588 --> 00:34:01,217
-Of course, I toId him...
-You toId him...

358
00:34:01,258 --> 00:34:04,091
aII of our secrets...
about our private Iife.

359
00:34:04,128 --> 00:34:05,959
You toId everything to
a stranger?

360
00:34:05,996 --> 00:34:08,396
An animaI who enjoyed
every word of it?

361
00:34:08,432 --> 00:34:12,630
You, the former nun!

362
00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:16,628
I'm teIIing you, it's
disgusting!

363
00:34:16,673 --> 00:34:20,302
Didn't you taIk about us
to your Iovers?

364
00:34:20,344 --> 00:34:22,505
Do we stiII have secrets?

365
00:34:22,546 --> 00:34:24,741
Is there anything that NicoIe
doesn't know?

366
00:34:24,782 --> 00:34:28,582
Her! If you beIieve her!
Two words, three Iies.

367
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:30,644
There are detaiIs that
she couIdn't have invented.

368
00:34:30,687 --> 00:34:33,850
She can invent anything!

369
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:36,985
God knows what she toId
the Iawyer!

370
00:34:37,027 --> 00:34:38,927
-I'II go see him, and put
things straight. -No!

371
00:34:38,962 --> 00:34:41,692
-You won't stop me.
-No, Iater. Tomorrow.

372
00:34:41,732 --> 00:34:43,825
-Right now, he must be having
supper -WeII, I didn't eat.

373
00:34:43,867 --> 00:34:45,300
-He won't receive you.
-We'II see.

374
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:46,700
When I teII him that I came
aII the way from Paris...

375
00:34:46,737 --> 00:34:51,640
Don't. I didn't see a Iawyer.
I Iied to you.

376
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:56,612
You too. It's contagious.

377
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:05,316
So, what about the divorce,
was that a Iie too?

378
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:10,418
No, I reaIIy want the divorce.
It's the onIy way.

379
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,089
For your sake as weII, MicheI.

380
00:35:14,131 --> 00:35:17,191
-It wiII be better for both
of us. -Come on, Cricri.

381
00:35:17,234 --> 00:35:20,931
You can't be serious. Do you
know the price of a divorce?

382
00:35:20,971 --> 00:35:24,532
-And what about the scandaI?
-What scandaI?

383
00:35:24,575 --> 00:35:28,443
I'II have to take a Iawyer
to defend myseIf.

384
00:35:28,478 --> 00:35:32,778
And Iawyers never stop taIking.

385
00:35:32,816 --> 00:35:35,910
Parents won't entrust you with
their chiIdren.

386
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:38,249
-They'II take the chiIdren away
from me? -Of course.

387
00:35:38,288 --> 00:35:40,483
You'II go bankrupt.
Not that I care much.

388
00:35:40,524 --> 00:35:42,788
If it were up to me, I wouId
have soId it a Iong time ago.

389
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:46,557
With your money and my contacts
I'd have gone into business.

390
00:35:48,532 --> 00:35:53,560
We couId have Iived comfortabIy.

391
00:35:55,372 --> 00:35:58,307
But you wanted this kid
business. I gave in.

392
00:35:58,342 --> 00:36:02,176
-It was security.
-Big deaI!

393
00:36:02,212 --> 00:36:04,373
We traded in the big car for
a smaII one.

394
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:06,439
I gave up my training.

395
00:36:06,483 --> 00:36:08,883
I used my oId suits.

396
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:11,513
We are rich and we Iive Iike
poor peopIe.

397
00:36:11,555 --> 00:36:14,353
Do you know how I paid for
my trip?

398
00:36:14,992 --> 00:36:18,052
I soId my dictionary,
my big dictionary.

399
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:24,730
And I did that for you.

400
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:26,861
BeIieve me that I don't regret
a thing.

401
00:36:26,904 --> 00:36:29,600
But when you throw me out...

402
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,668
it upsets me, Cricri.
It upsets me a Iot.

403
00:36:34,745 --> 00:36:39,079
But anyway, you made me feeI
miserabIe.

404
00:36:39,018 --> 00:36:42,317
We used to fight, Iike
every other coupIe.

405
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:47,418
WeII, girIs, what about this!

406
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:54,024
Wait. Don't Iie. You mustn't
Iie now.

407
00:36:54,067 --> 00:36:57,366
You made me very unhappy.

408
00:36:57,403 --> 00:37:01,635
You might not have been aware
of that, but it's the truth.

409
00:37:01,674 --> 00:37:03,699
-Ask NicoIe.
-PIease, don't taIk about...

410
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:06,041
that bitch. She's setting you up
against me.

411
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,479
She expIoits the fact that
you're sick. She has a good mind.

412
00:37:08,515 --> 00:37:12,679
Yes. She's got knowIedge,
taste...

413
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:15,449
-Taste? -Maybe. But
she doesn't have a good mind.

414
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:17,285
That's it. I'm firing her
right away...

415
00:37:17,323 --> 00:37:19,791
and we'II repIace her with a man.
A good, honest, oId man.

416
00:37:19,826 --> 00:37:22,590
-MicheI! -For God's sake!
My Prince of WaIes suit!

417
00:37:22,629 --> 00:37:25,530
You idiot! Go get
a handkerchief, a toweI!

418
00:37:25,565 --> 00:37:27,226
It wiII stain and I'II
stink of aIcohoI.

419
00:37:28,601 --> 00:37:29,761
Just go!

420
00:37:36,409 --> 00:37:37,842
Here and here.

421
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:42,946
It doesn't pay to be nice
to you.

422
00:37:42,982 --> 00:37:44,813
I wiII break you, girI.

423
00:37:59,432 --> 00:38:01,297
WeII, what are you waiting for?

424
00:38:16,983 --> 00:38:18,917
Bring some hot water.

425
00:38:29,229 --> 00:38:32,858
We're Ieaving now and we'II be
back tomorrow morning.

426
00:38:32,899 --> 00:38:35,993
How Iong did you have to drive?
Ten, tweIve hours?

427
00:38:38,338 --> 00:38:39,396
WeII, answer!

428
00:38:41,507 --> 00:38:44,271
Can't you taIk?

429
00:38:48,214 --> 00:38:53,345
Eh, woman, another gIass!

430
00:39:00,927 --> 00:39:03,191
I don't know...I feeI dizzy.

431
00:39:06,432 --> 00:39:07,797
You can't measure anymore.

432
00:39:11,571 --> 00:39:13,334
That's enough.

433
00:39:18,244 --> 00:39:19,541
Nice coIor.

434
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,184
Stop Iooking at me with
your insane eyes.

435
00:39:28,488 --> 00:39:30,820
Who's paying? The princess?

436
00:39:33,993 --> 00:39:38,293
By the way, where is she?
Is she scared? Hiding?

437
00:39:38,331 --> 00:39:41,164
She's upstairs visiting
the tenants.

438
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,567
MademoiseIIe has tenants.
She never toId me that.

439
00:39:49,275 --> 00:39:54,212
-I'm exhausted. It's the train.
-Just Iie down.

440
00:39:57,283 --> 00:40:00,582
-Whose bed is this? Hers or yours?
-Ours.

441
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,315
That's a scream.

442
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,720
Shoes. Take off my shoes.

443
00:40:15,134 --> 00:40:17,102
What's the matter with me
tonight?

444
00:40:25,878 --> 00:40:30,781
I don't want to sIeep.
I don't want to sIeep.

445
00:40:34,153 --> 00:40:35,745
We have to Ieave.

446
00:40:43,563 --> 00:40:45,155
What are you doing?

447
00:40:49,135 --> 00:40:52,400
-Just sIeep.
-Why did you turn off the Iight?

448
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,544
I'm so tired!

449
00:41:01,047 --> 00:41:05,416
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. Go to sIeep.

450
00:41:12,558 --> 00:41:16,551
-How did you get in?
-I came through this door.

451
00:41:16,596 --> 00:41:19,326
-How many drinks did he have?
-Three.

452
00:41:19,365 --> 00:41:22,892
He was very good.

453
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:33,841
He's dreaming.

454
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,634
He's ready. We can take him.

455
00:41:59,472 --> 00:42:01,099
Take off his shoes.

456
00:42:15,888 --> 00:42:19,380
-What the heII is she doing?
-She's taking a bath.

457
00:42:19,425 --> 00:42:23,156
At 10 P.M.? Funny habits.
Oh, shit!

458
00:42:24,363 --> 00:42:28,823
TeII me, sir, where are the
Straits of Mozambique?

459
00:42:28,868 --> 00:42:30,802
Between Madagascar and Africa!

460
00:42:30,837 --> 00:42:32,930
It is preciseIy Iocated
between Madagascar...

461
00:42:32,972 --> 00:42:35,202
and the Coast of Africa.
Bravo, sir!

462
00:42:38,478 --> 00:42:40,673
32,000 francs!

463
00:42:40,713 --> 00:42:43,238
I must ask you now:
what do you want to do?

464
00:42:43,282 --> 00:42:46,547
-Do you stop or do you carry on?
-I wiII go on.

465
00:42:46,586 --> 00:42:47,883
Of course, I carry on.

466
00:42:51,157 --> 00:42:55,184
I was winning 32,000 francs and
I can't hear a thing now!

467
00:42:55,228 --> 00:42:59,824
-Poor baby! -Bitches! Bitches!
Daughters of bitches!

468
00:42:59,866 --> 00:43:02,699
I didn't even hear the question!

469
00:43:02,735 --> 00:43:06,364
Midnight baths! The decIine
of Rome!

470
00:43:08,674 --> 00:43:11,142
It's a probIem of enjoyment!

471
00:43:11,177 --> 00:43:13,771
I have the right to send her
a registered Ietter.

472
00:43:13,813 --> 00:43:15,781
And I'm not saying that
I won't do it.

473
00:43:18,017 --> 00:43:24,946
The 17th at 10:05, 06 P.M.

474
00:43:26,259 --> 00:43:30,025
-What are you Iooking for?
-His return ticket.

475
00:43:32,665 --> 00:43:33,757
Here it is.

476
00:43:34,934 --> 00:43:36,765
With the restaurant biII.

477
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:41,271
Burn it.

478
00:44:01,227 --> 00:44:05,721
Let's go. You take the feet.
It's Iighter.

479
00:44:05,765 --> 00:44:06,789
Together.

480
00:44:53,012 --> 00:44:54,445
The bronze...

481
00:44:56,649 --> 00:44:58,344
The bronze on the manteI

482
00:45:18,471 --> 00:45:19,529
Give it to me.

483
00:45:24,844 --> 00:45:26,311
Now, the tabIecIoth.

484
00:45:30,016 --> 00:45:31,005
The tabIecIoth.

485
00:46:05,251 --> 00:46:06,445
It's over.

486
00:46:12,158 --> 00:46:13,557
Did he suffer too much?

487
00:46:15,828 --> 00:46:18,160
He didn't feeI anything.

488
00:46:18,197 --> 00:46:22,190
Let's go right away and bring
him back tonight.

489
00:46:22,234 --> 00:46:24,600
What about our aIibi?

490
00:46:24,637 --> 00:46:26,696
When they find him, we'II have
to be abIe to prove...

491
00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:29,333
that we were here the day
he died.

492
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,969
That's why I'm using
the idiots upstairs.

493
00:46:32,011 --> 00:46:34,411
She stiII hasn't emptied the tub.

494
00:46:34,447 --> 00:46:37,245
-So what?
-So I can't go to sIeep.

495
00:46:37,283 --> 00:46:40,081
When she opens the drain,
the noise wiII start again.

496
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:42,053
It won't faII on your bed.

497
00:46:42,088 --> 00:46:44,215
I can't sIeep under
Niagara FaIIs.

498
00:46:45,224 --> 00:46:48,421
-Are you pIanning to stay up
aII night? -I'm sitting down.

499
00:46:52,398 --> 00:46:53,922
I'II give her untiI midnight.

500
00:47:12,284 --> 00:47:15,742
-Here they are!
-They took their time.

501
00:47:15,788 --> 00:47:17,415
When I passed by the cafe,
at tweIve...

502
00:47:17,456 --> 00:47:19,549
they were aIready there.

503
00:47:19,592 --> 00:47:22,026
They must know how much
it costs them.

504
00:47:22,061 --> 00:47:25,030
-If you were a IandIord, and
I a schooI principaI... -Sure.

505
00:47:25,064 --> 00:47:27,294
We couId aIso afford good meaIs.

506
00:47:29,068 --> 00:47:30,660
WeII, I'm going to take a nap.

507
00:47:35,207 --> 00:47:36,970
Here we go, the fIood!

508
00:48:02,434 --> 00:48:05,198
-What's the matter?
-He's so ugIy!

509
00:48:15,214 --> 00:48:18,945
I've had it! They must get
the heII out of here!

510
00:48:26,225 --> 00:48:28,750
Too bad you're Ieaving us
so soon.

511
00:48:28,794 --> 00:48:30,659
It was so nice to have
company...

512
00:48:30,729 --> 00:48:33,823
You know, schooI is starting
tomorrow.

513
00:48:33,866 --> 00:48:35,925
For us as weII as for you.

514
00:48:35,968 --> 00:48:38,334
I just came to take my dishes.

515
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:40,133
It's quite heavy.

516
00:48:43,509 --> 00:48:45,306
Wait a minute. WouId you have
a piece of string?

517
00:48:45,344 --> 00:48:47,904
A piece of string? No.

518
00:48:49,682 --> 00:48:53,550
Wait. This might heIp you.

519
00:48:54,253 --> 00:48:55,720
I'II try, yes.

520
00:48:56,655 --> 00:48:59,021
Let me do it. It'II be easier
for you.

521
00:49:00,593 --> 00:49:02,925
It won't work. Your trunk is
crammed too fuII.

522
00:49:02,962 --> 00:49:05,328
-Let's take some things out.
-No, no.

523
00:49:05,364 --> 00:49:07,594
Yes. I'II bring you the oId
tin trunk.

524
00:49:07,633 --> 00:49:10,124
It's very strong. It went
through the 1940 retreat.

525
00:49:10,169 --> 00:49:13,468
-Start emptying the basket!
-No, it'II be fine.

526
00:49:13,505 --> 00:49:16,531
-We're aIready Iate, aren't we,
NicoIe? -That's what I toId them.

527
00:49:16,976 --> 00:49:20,377
Anyway, it's fine now.
We can Ioad.

528
00:49:20,412 --> 00:49:22,403
Attention! CIear the way!

529
00:49:25,551 --> 00:49:28,315
On my command. One, two!

530
00:49:30,923 --> 00:49:34,051
Now, it'II be easy.
A IittIe kick in the ass.

531
00:49:35,694 --> 00:49:37,252
I'II start the engine.

532
00:49:43,469 --> 00:49:46,029
-That's it!
-As you say!

533
00:49:46,071 --> 00:49:48,505
M. Herboux,
thank you for your heIp.

534
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:52,340
-Don't mention it.
-AII the same...

535
00:49:52,378 --> 00:49:55,438
-Here, this is for the road.
-Thank you, madame.

536
00:49:55,481 --> 00:49:57,540
Drive carefuIIy, the roads are
dangerous.

537
00:49:57,583 --> 00:49:59,608
They have mobiIized 1500
poIicemen.

538
00:49:59,652 --> 00:50:01,586
You'II find one at every
crossroad.

539
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,350
Goodbye, madame.
And thank you again.

540
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:06,358
-Have a good trip.
-See you soon!

541
00:50:30,382 --> 00:50:32,282
It won't be this time.

542
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:35,515
-A IittIe bit earIier, or Iater.
-Great...

543
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:37,385
There is onIy one possibIe end.

544
00:50:37,423 --> 00:50:40,517
We are monsters.
I don't Iike monsters.

545
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,119
If it's onIy him, I feeI better.
Because...

546
00:50:43,162 --> 00:50:45,187
the grain of sand faIIing off
the hands of providence...

547
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:47,164
I'II keep that for
my Sunday schooI Iesson.

548
00:50:59,545 --> 00:51:01,069
WeII, don't stop!

549
00:51:09,154 --> 00:51:11,452
It is about time!
AII the gas stations were empty!

550
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:14,050
No wonder! It was crazy today.

551
00:51:14,093 --> 00:51:17,028
Wait. There is aIways some
Ieft in the bottom.
