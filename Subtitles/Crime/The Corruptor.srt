1
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:32,862
Fukienese Dragons
not funny now, huh?!

2
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:36,428
According to police,
the Fukienese Dragons...

3
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:38,031
the newest entity
on the Chinatown crime scene...

4
00:03:38,074 --> 00:03:40,338
are headed by
20-year-old Bobby Vu...

5
00:03:40,377 --> 00:03:42,777
from the Fukien province
of China.

6
00:03:42,812 --> 00:03:45,508
Sources say the bombing
and the execution...

7
00:03:45,548 --> 00:03:48,381
of a known Tong soldier
are the latest chapter...

8
00:03:48,418 --> 00:03:50,010
in a power struggle between...

9
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:51,315
the Fukienese Dragons
youth gang...

10
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:54,118
and the Tong-run Tongfon
Benevolent Association...

11
00:03:54,157 --> 00:03:55,522
believed to be headed by...

12
00:03:55,558 --> 00:03:57,958
Local businessman
Benjamin Wong...

13
00:03:57,994 --> 00:04:00,360
known in the neighborhood
as Uncle Benny...

14
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:04,026
along with his lieutenant,
Henry Lee.

15
00:04:48,378 --> 00:04:49,538
Fuck you.

16
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:53,875
Learned some English.
Good for you.

17
00:04:59,122 --> 00:05:00,589
What the fuck?!

18
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:05,013
English?

19
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:08,919
Good. What do they call you?

20
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,152
Jack.

21
00:06:10,193 --> 00:06:11,626
I can't hear you.

22
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:17,555
Tell Bobby Vu his time
is running out in Chinatown.

23
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,700
In the history
of the 15th precinct...

24
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:59,401
few officers have done more
to serve and protect...

25
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:01,410
the public of this great city...

26
00:07:01,444 --> 00:07:03,935
than Lieutenant Nicholas Chen.

27
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,939
Lieutenant,for bravery
in the line of fire...

28
00:07:07,984 --> 00:07:09,576
and for bringing to justice...

29
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:12,520
those responsible
for the Chinatown bombings...

30
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:14,147
the people of New York
thank you...

31
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,556
and present you
with this commendation.

32
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,427
Let your brothers die, huh?

33
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:31,629
Are you Fukienese Dragon?

34
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:33,966
Yes! Fukienese Dragon.

35
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,801
Avenge your brothers. OK?

36
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,239
Kill that cop.

37
00:09:25,488 --> 00:09:27,319
Everybody works tonight.

38
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:29,381
We are visiting Ginzu Massage.

39
00:09:29,425 --> 00:09:31,290
My kind of raid.

40
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:34,023
Found another young pretty
in a Dumpster.

41
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:40,066
Anybody I know?

42
00:09:41,204 --> 00:09:44,264
Did a two-hour sweep.
No one would speak to me.

43
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:45,535
Try breath mints.

44
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:48,009
The two who found the body...

45
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:50,308
say they didn't see,
hear, or smell anything.

46
00:09:50,346 --> 00:09:51,506
What's new?

47
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:55,775
Daniel Wallace.

48
00:09:57,787 --> 00:09:59,778
I was assigned to this unit.

49
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:06,292
You know the Chinese
don't trust whites or cops.

50
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:07,455
You give me a white cop?

51
00:10:07,497 --> 00:10:09,692
You've been squawking
about more man power?

52
00:10:09,732 --> 00:10:12,428
They want more ethnic diversity
in each squad. Bing.

53
00:10:12,468 --> 00:10:14,834
You get a white face in A.G.U.

54
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:18,068
He's worse than white.
He's green!

55
00:10:18,107 --> 00:10:20,075
Good. You school him, then.

56
00:10:20,109 --> 00:10:21,508
So he can get me killed?

57
00:10:21,544 --> 00:10:24,104
It's your fault he's here
in the first place.

58
00:10:24,147 --> 00:10:25,409
My fault?

59
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:28,008
A freakin' tourist gets blown up
in our own backyard...

60
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,881
and it was on your watch!

61
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:33,851
Mayor's on television
talkin' about it.

62
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,223
Police commissioner's promising
safe streets in Chinatown...

63
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,785
Christ,
it was even on Nightline.

64
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,128
So, if puttin' a white cop
in the Asian gang unit...

65
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,862
makes them happy
and gets them off my back...

66
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:47,529
fine and dandy.

67
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,037
Now get outta here.

68
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:51,335
Do something about those whores
turning up in Dumpsters.

69
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:52,807
It's an embarrassment.

70
00:10:56,212 --> 00:10:57,474
Are you still here?

71
00:11:03,553 --> 00:11:06,021
Why does a white cop
request the Asian gang unit?

72
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:08,717
Detective's shield.
Extra eight grand a year.

73
00:11:08,758 --> 00:11:10,157
A chance to work with you.

74
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:12,718
Uh-oh, yellow fever.

75
00:11:12,762 --> 00:11:16,493
You got a hard-on
for all things Chinese, right?

76
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:19,000
Food, customs, women?

77
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:21,936
I bet you got a Chinese
girlfriend, don't ya?

78
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:23,199
Actually, no, I don't.

79
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:24,433
But you did.

80
00:11:26,576 --> 00:11:29,044
Are we all gonna exchange
our sexual histories here?

81
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,639
I knew it. Yellow fuckin' fever.

82
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:33,910
Junior's here
to walk the street...

83
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,441
and get his wick licked
by a nice almond-eyed beauty.

84
00:11:36,485 --> 00:11:40,012
I'm here so Chinese immigrants
don't have to live 30 a room...

85
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:43,150
work 20 hours a day
makin' close to slave wages.

86
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:46,684
Why do you give a shit
about the Chinese immigrants?

87
00:11:46,729 --> 00:11:50,165
I'm a cop. I give a shit
about enforcing the law.

88
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:52,667
So, what's your plan
to save the yellow people?

89
00:11:52,702 --> 00:11:56,194
Same as in every other organized
crime operation in the city...

90
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:58,571
bust the street soldiers
every time we see them...

91
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:00,235
work our way up the food chain
to the council...

92
00:12:00,276 --> 00:12:02,039
cramp them with surveillance
and sting operations...

93
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:04,273
and keep climbing
all the way to Benjamin Wong.

94
00:12:07,116 --> 00:12:09,846
This ain't every other organized
crime operation in the city.

95
00:12:09,886 --> 00:12:11,751
We work cases,junior.

96
00:12:11,787 --> 00:12:13,618
Keep the tourists safe.

97
00:12:13,656 --> 00:12:15,817
Violence spills in the street,
we break heads.

98
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:18,292
You don't change Chinatown, boy.

99
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:19,794
It changes you.

100
00:12:22,398 --> 00:12:24,866
I'm ready to give it a shot.
That's why I'm here, sir.

101
00:12:28,237 --> 00:12:29,397
All right.

102
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,764
Don't make plans tonight.

103
00:12:33,776 --> 00:12:35,073
Why not?

104
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:38,638
'Cause we're going
on a panty raid.

105
00:12:57,433 --> 00:12:59,060
Never know how a guy
getting his dick rubbed...

106
00:12:59,101 --> 00:13:00,762
is gonna react when you
charge in the room.

107
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:02,668
So keep your eyes sharp
and your Glock cocked.

108
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:05,674
Don't try to feel any Chinese
titties, you little pervert.

109
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,040
Hey, boy... stay down there.

110
00:13:15,318 --> 00:13:17,013
Go on.

111
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:18,213
Police!

112
00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:25,523
We've got eight maybe.

113
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:27,188
-The place is secured?
-Hold on a second.

114
00:13:29,131 --> 00:13:31,998
Deng, see if you can find
any files back there.

115
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:34,730
John, take 'em down.
Otis will help you.

116
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:35,896
Come on.

117
00:13:35,938 --> 00:13:37,428
Come on, ladies.

118
00:14:06,869 --> 00:14:09,167
Want me to take her for ya?

119
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:11,765
Always throw back
the smallest fish of the day.

120
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:12,967
Let's go.

121
00:14:31,394 --> 00:14:32,827
Jump!

122
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:41,100
Fire your weapon!

123
00:14:45,741 --> 00:14:46,935
The Fukienese!

124
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,821
Damn.

125
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:47,268
I'm out on three!

126
00:15:47,303 --> 00:15:50,272
One, two... three!

127
00:15:57,012 --> 00:15:58,172
Stop!

128
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,782
Come on! We've had it!

129
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:21,999
Drop your weapon! Drop it!

130
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:28,134
Hands to the wall!

131
00:16:30,713 --> 00:16:32,704
Stupid Fukienese!

132
00:16:38,587 --> 00:16:40,111
You're late.

133
00:16:41,824 --> 00:16:45,191
Ung! Get me the car.

134
00:17:02,845 --> 00:17:04,142
Bobby Vu!

135
00:17:26,202 --> 00:17:28,966
You want some?!

136
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,735
Fukienese Dragon.

137
00:18:05,774 --> 00:18:08,368
Beef intestine noodles.
Want some?

138
00:18:10,346 --> 00:18:14,112
Want to be a Chinese,
you got to eat the nasty stuff.

139
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:18,212
You saved my life last night.

140
00:18:18,254 --> 00:18:20,188
Part of my job.

141
00:18:20,222 --> 00:18:22,747
Hey, man,
I still want to say thanks.

142
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:28,194
That said, I heard
you paid a visit to Bobby Vu.

143
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:32,559
I tightened up,
but I didn't find my badge...

144
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:34,831
in a freakin' Crackerjack box.
I earned it.

145
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,829
You study Chinese, so you know
what it means I saved your life.

146
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:42,603
It means my life is yours
to do with as you wish.

147
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:45,705
That's right.
So here's my advice--

148
00:18:45,748 --> 00:18:48,239
quit before you end up dead.

149
00:18:49,952 --> 00:18:52,079
If you don't want to work
with me, fine.

150
00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:54,351
Let me do my own investigation.

151
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,688
Don't keep me from my work.
Like it or not, I'm a cop.

152
00:18:56,725 --> 00:18:58,693
You a cop?

153
00:18:58,727 --> 00:19:00,388
You're playing cop.

154
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:02,659
Playing?
Playing's driving past shit...

155
00:19:02,698 --> 00:19:05,531
pretending
you didn't even see it.

156
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:07,262
That's what playing is.

157
00:19:08,837 --> 00:19:12,500
You got something to say?
Say it.

158
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:15,067
Why don't I show you?

159
00:19:22,851 --> 00:19:24,682
Cops! Get out of here!

160
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:34,523
Police, freeze!

161
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:39,424
Freeze!

162
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,837
What do we have here?

163
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:53,444
Hands behind your back.

164
00:19:53,482 --> 00:19:54,972
You're under arrest.

165
00:19:57,619 --> 00:19:59,018
FBI.

166
00:19:59,054 --> 00:20:04,356
I want each one of these guys
in different rooms...now!

167
00:20:07,096 --> 00:20:10,429
Each guy in different rooms,
right now.

168
00:20:10,466 --> 00:20:12,024
Can I talk to you, please?

169
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,039
What's up, Pete?

170
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:25,012
Nothing.

171
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:26,810
Only that you assholes
just arrested...

172
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:29,340
a federal agent working
undercover with the Tongs.

173
00:20:29,385 --> 00:20:30,784
Nice work, junior.

174
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:32,514
I made the arrest.

175
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:34,647
Well, goody for you.

176
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:39,127
So tell me, Einstein,
what am I supposed to do now?

177
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:43,126
What do I do?

178
00:20:43,165 --> 00:20:46,293
Put a federal agent in jail
to maintain his cover?

179
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:48,428
What do I do? Let him go?

180
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:51,163
We put him back on the street...

181
00:20:51,206 --> 00:20:53,766
everyone in Chinatown will think
he cut a deal with you...

182
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:55,470
and he'll be dead
inside an hour.

183
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:56,739
So what should I do?

184
00:20:56,779 --> 00:20:59,145
Do a better job
of keeping us informed.

185
00:20:59,181 --> 00:21:01,274
-Hear, hear.
-Right.

186
00:21:01,316 --> 00:21:03,716
Confidential
undercover assignment...

187
00:21:03,752 --> 00:21:05,982
key word being "confidential..."

188
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:09,980
which nothing in
this 15th precinct is. Nothing.

189
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:15,189
Relax, Pete.
We lost the drugs, no evidence.

190
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,221
They can all go.

191
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:25,298
All right, all right.

192
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,002
Three hours, slap the shit
out of them, let them go.

193
00:21:28,043 --> 00:21:29,977
I want everything
on the Ginzu raid by today...

194
00:21:30,012 --> 00:21:32,071
and keep that dipshit
on a leash.

195
00:21:33,882 --> 00:21:37,374
You take care of your people,
I'll take care of mine.

196
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:38,784
Which one's FBI?

197
00:21:39,788 --> 00:21:41,187
The Chinese one.

198
00:21:42,324 --> 00:21:44,952
Do you want to eat this
with soy sauce?

199
00:21:55,904 --> 00:21:57,462
Cough up the cash, junior.

200
00:21:57,506 --> 00:21:59,406
Knuckleheads buy all rounds.

201
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:00,635
Blow me.

202
00:22:01,977 --> 00:22:04,878
That's it,
show a little piss and vinegar.

203
00:22:04,913 --> 00:22:07,108
So your first bust
was a federal agent...

204
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:11,085
and a senior fed bit off
a giant piece of your ass.

205
00:22:15,324 --> 00:22:18,316
So why did the FBI
want the info on the Ginzu raid?

206
00:22:19,928 --> 00:22:21,896
It was their raid.

207
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,899
They use us
so nobody knows it's the FBI.

208
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:27,993
Mostly, they use us
because they are lazy shits.

209
00:22:28,036 --> 00:22:30,129
Last summer
we grabbed a Vietnamese gang...

210
00:22:30,172 --> 00:22:32,470
bringing in heroin
by the boatload.

211
00:22:32,508 --> 00:22:34,942
Who swoops in last minute
to get the credit?

212
00:22:34,977 --> 00:22:37,571
Yourfriend,
Schabacker of the FBI.

213
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:41,481
Now they have agent working
undercover inside the Tongs.

214
00:22:41,517 --> 00:22:44,577
We find the agent,
see what he's got going.

215
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,054
When the time is right,
we make the bust...

216
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:49,717
and pull the case
right out from under them.

217
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,597
You speak Chinese?

218
00:23:00,636 --> 00:23:02,536
Doesn't everybody in Chinatown?

219
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:06,264
Danny Wallace...Henry Lee.

220
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:08,276
You gentlemen are partners?

221
00:23:09,177 --> 00:23:10,337
Are we?

222
00:23:12,714 --> 00:23:14,614
Cagney and Lacey.

223
00:23:15,484 --> 00:23:17,918
Chinatown needs more police.

224
00:23:17,953 --> 00:23:20,046
I hope you find a home here.

225
00:23:20,088 --> 00:23:23,785
I think you'll discover that
Chinese are warm and generous.

226
00:23:23,825 --> 00:23:26,191
I hope to see much of you
in the coming weeks.

227
00:23:26,228 --> 00:23:28,025
Enjoy.

228
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:32,857
He's Tong.

229
00:23:32,901 --> 00:23:38,134
That's why it's Krystal
and not Astifucking Spumanti.

230
00:23:56,959 --> 00:24:01,362
It is very dangerous
to approach a white policeman.

231
00:24:01,396 --> 00:24:05,958
We cannot risk exposing our
other ties in the department.

232
00:24:06,001 --> 00:24:09,596
That's why, Uncle,
we must approach Wallace.

233
00:24:09,638 --> 00:24:11,538
He could compromise Chen...

234
00:24:11,573 --> 00:24:15,976
at a time when he's our best
weapon against the Fukes.

235
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:21,244
We need him with us
to save Ga Chen's position.

236
00:24:21,283 --> 00:24:23,217
Besides, to the NYPD...

237
00:24:23,251 --> 00:24:25,947
Chen is Chinese first
and a cop second.

238
00:24:25,988 --> 00:24:29,185
Chen can take care of himself.
He knows what we need of him.

239
00:24:29,224 --> 00:24:31,886
He knows what he hears
in the 15th.

240
00:24:31,927 --> 00:24:35,727
A white officer with ears
outside the precinct.

241
00:24:35,764 --> 00:24:38,460
We could let Chen
test the waters.

242
00:25:03,225 --> 00:25:04,419
What do you want?

243
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:06,757
I liked your partner.

244
00:25:06,795 --> 00:25:08,729
I think he could help us.

245
00:25:08,764 --> 00:25:10,254
He could hurt us more.

246
00:25:10,298 --> 00:25:12,630
Afraid of competition?

247
00:25:12,668 --> 00:25:14,659
Afraid of piquing
the kid's interest.

248
00:25:14,703 --> 00:25:17,365
You know who else
is a dirty cop.

249
00:25:20,442 --> 00:25:22,410
Uncle Benny feels
he might poke his nose...

250
00:25:22,444 --> 00:25:25,777
in places
a Chinese cop wouldn't.

251
00:25:25,814 --> 00:25:27,805
I can handle him.

252
00:25:28,817 --> 00:25:33,117
As a fuse, he might be
an asset against the Fukes...

253
00:25:33,155 --> 00:25:36,716
since you don't seem
to be doing much, eh?

254
00:25:41,263 --> 00:25:43,424
I will take care of the Fukes.

255
00:25:43,465 --> 00:25:46,491
The kid's a short-time.
Leave him alone.

256
00:25:48,303 --> 00:25:52,603
I didn't realize
you had such maternal instincts.

257
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:56,400
Uncle Benny wants you
to speak with him.

258
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:06,718
This costs one dollar to make...

259
00:26:06,755 --> 00:26:10,020
and some fool
will pay hundreds for it.

260
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:12,891
It's amazing how easy
it is for some people...

261
00:26:12,928 --> 00:26:15,692
to overestimate worth.

262
00:26:15,731 --> 00:26:17,858
Don't overestimate yours.

263
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:21,134
Talk to him.

264
00:26:46,762 --> 00:26:49,390
-Who's in the bin?
-The invisible woman.

265
00:26:49,431 --> 00:26:52,161
No ID, no prints, no nothing.

266
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:02,974
Thought you liked Chinese food,
junior.

267
00:27:03,011 --> 00:27:04,706
Shut up.

268
00:27:04,746 --> 00:27:06,680
Let's go.
I need about 50 coffees.

269
00:27:06,715 --> 00:27:08,512
We're not going to
investigate this?

270
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,018
-We just did.
-What are you talking about?

271
00:27:12,154 --> 00:27:13,951
Tell our partner
what we learned.

272
00:27:13,989 --> 00:27:16,082
Deceased is an illegal,
straight off the boat.

273
00:27:16,124 --> 00:27:17,489
Probably less than a week.

274
00:27:17,526 --> 00:27:20,120
There's two bills Chinese
under the oysters by her spleen.

275
00:27:20,162 --> 00:27:23,188
She finds her passage over
was twice what she thought.

276
00:27:23,231 --> 00:27:25,665
She can't pay and doesn't like
working as a prostitute...

277
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,133
so she ends up here.

278
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:29,262
No family, no friends,
no witnesses.

279
00:27:29,304 --> 00:27:31,636
No sense wasting
taxpayers' money.

280
00:27:32,874 --> 00:27:34,637
What, so case closed?

281
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,938
Take a walk with Deng.

282
00:27:36,978 --> 00:27:39,845
-See if anybody knows anything.
-Sure.

283
00:27:41,616 --> 00:27:42,776
Let's go.

284
00:27:52,227 --> 00:27:53,819
-Careful.
-OK. Go ahead.

285
00:28:23,391 --> 00:28:25,916
-What the fuck, man?!
-Easy, Jackaroo!

286
00:28:25,961 --> 00:28:28,259
Detective Chen is now able
to identify the shooter...

287
00:28:28,296 --> 00:28:30,025
who got away
from the lamp store.

288
00:28:30,065 --> 00:28:32,226
Unless you can do
something for me.

289
00:28:32,267 --> 00:28:33,700
I want Bobby Vu.

290
00:28:33,735 --> 00:28:35,327
He'd kill me.

291
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:38,601
The alternative to helping us
is 10 to 20 in Sing Sing.

292
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,971
And that's got to hurt...

293
00:28:40,008 --> 00:28:43,409
especially for somebody
98 pounds soaking wet.

294
00:28:43,445 --> 00:28:44,742
No court, no wire?

295
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:46,269
No promises.

296
00:28:47,415 --> 00:28:48,780
Think about it.

297
00:28:48,817 --> 00:28:51,650
You got 10 seconds
to make up your mind.

298
00:28:53,388 --> 00:28:56,619
Five...four...three...

299
00:28:56,658 --> 00:28:58,125
Fuck you.

300
00:28:59,494 --> 00:29:01,155
Kid's loyal.

301
00:29:02,264 --> 00:29:06,064
See how loyal he is
after two weeks in lockup.

302
00:30:08,096 --> 00:30:09,757
Could've killed you.

303
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:11,857
Could've killed you first.

304
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,301
-What are you doing here?
-Father can't visit his son?

305
00:30:15,337 --> 00:30:16,634
Got something to drink?

306
00:30:16,671 --> 00:30:18,935
I'm as dry as a 90-year-old tit.

307
00:30:18,974 --> 00:30:20,601
How'd you get in?

308
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,305
Twenty years
robbery and homicide...

309
00:30:24,346 --> 00:30:26,473
out of the two-five, greenhorn.

310
00:30:26,514 --> 00:30:30,211
That's how I got in.
Been through more windows--

311
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:32,276
I don't have any money.

312
00:30:37,092 --> 00:30:40,994
I'm in for 12 grand.
Fucking dagos down on Mulberry.

313
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:42,360
Good luck.

314
00:30:42,397 --> 00:30:45,059
I'm not asking for the 12.

315
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,967
Godforbid you bail me out
with your lawyer money.

316
00:30:48,003 --> 00:30:51,734
I wouldn't want you to miss out
on becoming a leech, asshole.

317
00:30:52,774 --> 00:30:56,210
I thought you'd want me to be
a chip off the old block.

318
00:30:56,244 --> 00:31:00,078
All I'm asking is a little
stake money to get me even.

319
00:31:01,116 --> 00:31:03,641
Wouldn't work.
Too much of a loser.

320
00:31:03,685 --> 00:31:05,312
Then we'll go partners.

321
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:10,246
You was always
a lucky son of a bitch, eh?

322
00:31:22,303 --> 00:31:24,999
I wouldn't be here
if this wasn't serious.

323
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:55,569
Cold, hard cash. You slay me.

324
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:58,663
There's a little over 500 there,
and we're not partners.

325
00:31:58,706 --> 00:32:00,003
That's to buy you off.

326
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:01,668
Next time you sneak up on me--

327
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:04,644
Yeah, I know.
You'll kill me, huh?

328
00:32:06,081 --> 00:32:08,413
By the way...

329
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,350
there's a chink watching you...

330
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:13,183
from across the street,
Sherlock.

331
00:32:15,957 --> 00:32:18,050
Good night, Officer.

332
00:32:21,396 --> 00:32:23,421
Yeah, you're welcome.

333
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,348
I got something for you.

334
00:32:42,383 --> 00:32:44,544
I love gifts.

335
00:32:45,353 --> 00:32:48,686
This isn't free. Forget the kid.

336
00:32:48,723 --> 00:32:51,715
That's an expensive request.

337
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:54,523
This is an expensive item.

338
00:32:55,563 --> 00:32:57,554
Let's hear it.

339
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:59,794
The FBI have an informant
inside the Tong.

340
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:04,066
This time...
it's one of their own.

341
00:33:04,105 --> 00:33:05,732
It's an agent.

342
00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:07,400
Who is it?

343
00:33:07,442 --> 00:33:08,966
Don't know.

344
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:12,946
We picked up four of your guys,
and one was a fed.

345
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:16,007
Won't take long to find out
which one...

346
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:19,019
then all you got to do
is blow his cover...

347
00:33:19,053 --> 00:33:20,611
and they'll pull him.

348
00:33:20,655 --> 00:33:23,123
No violence, no mess.

349
00:33:23,158 --> 00:33:25,388
My thanks.

350
00:33:25,426 --> 00:33:27,621
The kid is out.

351
00:33:29,497 --> 00:33:31,397
As you wish.

352
00:33:42,043 --> 00:33:44,739
Would you like May
to give you a grape?

353
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:00,756
We need to delay the start
of our new partnership.

354
00:34:00,795 --> 00:34:03,628
We've got a federal agent
sniffing around.

355
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:08,401
I have to postpone delivery.

356
00:34:08,436 --> 00:34:10,996
We can't.

357
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,167
The boat's coming into port
next week.

358
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,904
It'll wait at the port.

359
00:34:17,946 --> 00:34:19,937
I'm not afraid of the FBI.

360
00:34:19,981 --> 00:34:21,278
Everything we've done...

361
00:34:21,316 --> 00:34:23,147
has been to keep the feds' focus
on Uncle Benny.

362
00:34:23,184 --> 00:34:25,049
When he's gone
and I lead the Tongs...

363
00:34:25,086 --> 00:34:26,951
you'll make
all the money you want.

364
00:34:26,988 --> 00:34:29,218
Let's kill him now.

365
00:34:29,257 --> 00:34:30,884
When Uncle Benny's indicted...

366
00:34:30,925 --> 00:34:33,052
he'll be a danger
to our partners in Hong Kong.

367
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:35,892
Killing him then
will come with thanks...

368
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,659
instead of retribution.

369
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:40,065
We kill Chen,too.

370
00:34:41,236 --> 00:34:43,534
All in good time.

371
00:34:53,181 --> 00:34:55,115
Do you remember me?

372
00:34:57,318 --> 00:34:59,582
I have information
about the girl...

373
00:34:59,621 --> 00:35:02,385
you found
in the garbage Dumpster.

374
00:35:02,423 --> 00:35:03,720
How'd you find me?

375
00:35:03,758 --> 00:35:07,023
You're conspicuous in Chinatown.

376
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:09,996
Two brothers on Christie Street
bring in illegals.

377
00:35:10,031 --> 00:35:12,431
That girl worked in their
brothel, then tried to run.

378
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:15,527
They left her
as a message to the others.

379
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:16,696
How do you know?

380
00:35:16,738 --> 00:35:19,366
Everyone knows,
but no one speaks of it...

381
00:35:19,407 --> 00:35:21,204
especially to police.

382
00:35:21,242 --> 00:35:24,837
-So why are you?
-I knew her.

383
00:35:25,913 --> 00:35:27,312
What are their names?

384
00:35:27,348 --> 00:35:30,806
You can't tell anyone,
not even Chen.

385
00:35:30,852 --> 00:35:32,843
Forget about it.
I can't do that.

386
00:35:32,887 --> 00:35:35,720
For every person who knows,
chances of me or my children...

387
00:35:35,757 --> 00:35:38,385
being killed in reprisal
increases a hundredfold.

388
00:35:40,461 --> 00:35:43,021
The girl was 15...

389
00:35:43,064 --> 00:35:46,158
and there are more to come
if you don't help us.

390
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,431
Check out the basement
of a place called Tony's.

391
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,566
Don't worry. This is how things
get done in Chinatown.

392
00:36:05,453 --> 00:36:07,080
The boy come in yet?

393
00:36:07,121 --> 00:36:09,316
Not that I've seen.

394
00:38:40,475 --> 00:38:42,306
Police,freeze!

395
00:38:51,419 --> 00:38:52,852
Freeze!

396
00:38:54,922 --> 00:38:56,685
I said freeze!

397
00:39:04,665 --> 00:39:07,225
What were you doing in here?

398
00:39:07,268 --> 00:39:09,065
I was coming out
of the diner on Pell...

399
00:39:09,103 --> 00:39:11,230
and I saw this guy
snatch a purse...

400
00:39:11,272 --> 00:39:12,762
so I chased him
into the building.

401
00:39:12,807 --> 00:39:14,832
I lost him as soon
as I got inside.

402
00:39:14,876 --> 00:39:17,242
Then I heard some screaming
from down here...

403
00:39:17,278 --> 00:39:18,745
and I just kind of
stumbled onto it.

404
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:21,441
We got close to 40 women here,
all illegals...

405
00:39:21,482 --> 00:39:23,541
and we found a store room
with about a hundred tapes.

406
00:39:23,584 --> 00:39:24,812
And the land lord remembers...

407
00:39:24,852 --> 00:39:26,752
the four Jane Does we pulled
out of the Dumpsters...

408
00:39:26,787 --> 00:39:28,550
were part of the stable.

409
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:29,851
Good job, Officer.

410
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:31,085
Thanks.

411
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,752
Yeah,way to go.

412
00:39:34,762 --> 00:39:35,888
Good job.

413
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,488
For bravery
in the line of fire...

414
00:39:37,532 --> 00:39:39,966
the mayor and people of New York
thank you, Officer Wallace...

415
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:41,992
and present you
with this commendation.

416
00:40:06,794 --> 00:40:08,659
It's dick size.

417
00:40:08,696 --> 00:40:11,563
You think everything
is dick size, huh?

418
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,195
White people believe
all Asians got little dicks.

419
00:40:16,237 --> 00:40:19,900
You think when an Asian chick
sees your pecker...

420
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:22,501
she's going to think
it's Mount St. Helens.

421
00:40:25,546 --> 00:40:27,241
It's true.

422
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:31,445
Then, you look at the tiny hands
on most Asian chicks...

423
00:40:31,485 --> 00:40:33,749
and figure your weenie's
going to look...

424
00:40:33,788 --> 00:40:36,382
like a sewer pipe in her fist.

425
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:38,915
He's discovered my secret.

426
00:40:40,528 --> 00:40:42,462
Well, the joke's on you...

427
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:46,159
'cause this Chinaman's
hung like a fucking--

428
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,997
Gnat!

429
00:40:48,035 --> 00:40:50,697
You want to see?

430
00:40:51,973 --> 00:40:55,602
Hey, come on.
Put that thing away.

431
00:40:55,643 --> 00:40:58,203
That's my cue.
I'm gonna see you guys tomorrow.

432
00:40:58,245 --> 00:40:59,712
Eight sharp.

433
00:40:59,747 --> 00:41:02,011
We got to put a tag
on those guys you busted...

434
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:04,574
find out which one
is the FBI agent.

435
00:41:19,967 --> 00:41:23,061
You did a lot for those women.
You did a good job.

436
00:41:23,104 --> 00:41:24,594
Thanks.

437
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:26,732
But it was an accident.

438
00:41:26,774 --> 00:41:29,709
You are lucky
you are not dead...

439
00:41:29,744 --> 00:41:34,113
so don't you ever
go off alone again.

440
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:03,710
Congratulations, Danny.

441
00:42:04,779 --> 00:42:06,246
Thanks. Look, I got to--

442
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,680
You must allow me
to buy you a drink.

443
00:42:10,384 --> 00:42:11,874
I'd like to, but I got to go.

444
00:42:11,919 --> 00:42:14,353
You've done a great thing for
the people of this community.

445
00:42:14,388 --> 00:42:17,516
Let me thank you,
as a show of respect.

446
00:42:17,558 --> 00:42:19,185
Please.

447
00:44:01,428 --> 00:44:02,554
Shit!

448
00:44:02,596 --> 00:44:05,394
I tried to, but I never made it.

449
00:44:05,432 --> 00:44:07,059
We gotta get you to a hospital.

450
00:44:07,101 --> 00:44:08,261
No time.

451
00:44:09,703 --> 00:44:11,330
Shit, you're bleeding
inside, Pop.

452
00:44:11,372 --> 00:44:14,170
I wouldn't be surprised.

453
00:44:14,208 --> 00:44:15,766
I need the money.

454
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,778
I don't have
that kind of money, Pop.

455
00:44:17,812 --> 00:44:19,473
How much you got?

456
00:44:19,513 --> 00:44:21,447
I don't know. A grand at most.

457
00:44:24,185 --> 00:44:25,812
Shit.

458
00:44:25,853 --> 00:44:27,616
Shit! Come on, again.

459
00:44:30,991 --> 00:44:35,087
Would you give it to me
if you had it?

460
00:44:35,129 --> 00:44:37,927
No, I don't think I could, Pop.

461
00:44:37,965 --> 00:44:41,162
Fuckin' honest,
just like your mother.

462
00:44:41,202 --> 00:44:43,568
Screw it then.

463
00:44:43,871 --> 00:44:45,566
Might as well
go to the hospital.

464
00:44:45,606 --> 00:44:48,598
Come on. We'll get you there.

465
00:44:48,642 --> 00:44:50,337
Come on!

466
00:44:51,779 --> 00:44:54,304
What's goin' on? Figure out
which one's the FBI agent?

467
00:44:54,348 --> 00:44:55,872
If he's there,
we haven't seen him.

468
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:57,406
You better get in there.

469
00:44:57,451 --> 00:44:59,442
He's fuckin' pissed at you.

470
00:44:59,486 --> 00:45:00,953
What's new?

471
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:07,320
-You are late.
-Sorry about that.

472
00:45:11,298 --> 00:45:13,766
My old man fell last night.
I took him to the hospital.

473
00:45:15,102 --> 00:45:16,592
Took all night?

474
00:45:16,637 --> 00:45:19,936
He fell last night, but I didn't
find him until this morning.

475
00:45:19,974 --> 00:45:21,339
He was in the bathroom.

476
00:45:25,546 --> 00:45:28,379
-Looks like he scratched you.
-I was carrying him.

477
00:45:28,415 --> 00:45:30,349
He all right?

478
00:45:30,384 --> 00:45:32,477
Yeah. He should be fine.

479
00:45:34,989 --> 00:45:37,219
He was a cop, right?

480
00:45:37,258 --> 00:45:38,816
Yeah, in the two-five.

481
00:45:38,859 --> 00:45:40,986
Tough beat.

482
00:45:41,028 --> 00:45:44,191
Is that why you're here,
prove something to your old man?

483
00:45:44,231 --> 00:45:46,062
No. Is that why you're here?

484
00:45:47,935 --> 00:45:49,766
My old man's dead.

485
00:45:49,803 --> 00:45:52,067
I don't have to prove anything
to anybody.

486
00:45:52,106 --> 00:45:53,232
How about you?

487
00:45:53,274 --> 00:45:55,174
Just to you, I guess.

488
00:45:55,209 --> 00:45:58,303
That's for sure.

489
00:45:58,345 --> 00:46:01,610
Why do you have to constantly
break my balls?

490
00:46:04,618 --> 00:46:06,586
I'm educating you well
this time.

491
00:46:07,888 --> 00:46:09,981
Do you mean you care about me?

492
00:46:10,024 --> 00:46:13,391
I don't know what to say.

493
00:46:13,427 --> 00:46:14,826
Try nothing.

494
00:46:14,862 --> 00:46:16,420
Oh, man, I'm overwhelmed.

495
00:46:16,463 --> 00:46:19,091
I had no idea
you felt this way about me.

496
00:46:19,133 --> 00:46:23,433
I mean, it's just
very kind and warm and...

497
00:46:25,539 --> 00:46:26,665
Check this out.

498
00:46:26,707 --> 00:46:28,470
These guys
don't look like junkies.

499
00:46:41,422 --> 00:46:43,686
-You got pictures?
-Not all of them.

500
00:46:47,428 --> 00:46:48,793
Shit!

501
00:46:58,472 --> 00:47:00,167
Police!

502
00:47:28,335 --> 00:47:30,030
Meet me with the car!

503
00:47:51,725 --> 00:47:53,852
Come on, boy!

504
00:47:55,963 --> 00:47:58,261
This is car seven
in the green sector.

505
00:47:58,298 --> 00:48:00,323
We are in pursuit
of a burgundy Cadillac...

506
00:48:00,367 --> 00:48:04,098
Jersey plates, five-nine-five-
alpha-alpha-Zulu...

507
00:48:04,138 --> 00:48:05,867
traveling south on Park Row.

508
00:48:05,906 --> 00:48:07,305
Suspects armed and dangerous.

509
00:48:07,341 --> 00:48:09,206
Requesting roadblock units
on all lanes.

510
00:48:16,483 --> 00:48:20,783
All green units, 10-85.

511
00:48:20,821 --> 00:48:24,188
Burgundy Cadillac traveling
south on Park Road...

512
00:48:24,224 --> 00:48:26,454
suspects armed and dangerous...

513
00:50:07,327 --> 00:50:08,624
Nick, right there!

514
00:50:50,671 --> 00:50:51,831
Chen, watch out!

515
00:51:45,058 --> 00:51:46,923
Oh, damn it!

516
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:51,527
You OK?

517
00:52:04,645 --> 00:52:07,808
Go! I said go!

518
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:36,532
Watch your backs!

519
00:52:43,517 --> 00:52:46,008
-You all right?
-You?

520
00:52:56,963 --> 00:52:59,727
Six innocent by standers...

521
00:52:59,766 --> 00:53:02,234
dozens of cars...

522
00:53:02,269 --> 00:53:05,602
millions in property,
all destroyed...

523
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:06,936
not to mention...

524
00:53:06,973 --> 00:53:12,434
Federal Agent Roland Ming
is dead...

525
00:53:12,479 --> 00:53:15,607
shot seven times in the back.

526
00:53:15,649 --> 00:53:20,313
And I'm thinkin' some scumbag
in the 15th is responsible.

527
00:53:20,354 --> 00:53:22,584
Maybe some scumbag
in the Bureau is responsible.

528
00:53:22,622 --> 00:53:24,453
Yeah, and maybe I'm gonna
grow a tree out of my dick.

529
00:53:24,491 --> 00:53:26,083
If anybody could--

530
00:53:26,126 --> 00:53:28,287
You bet your ass it'd be an oak.

531
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:33,861
They ID'd the shooters.

532
00:53:35,369 --> 00:53:36,768
They're Fukienese.

533
00:53:38,271 --> 00:53:40,603
Fukes have been making
a move on Tongs for months.

534
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,107
It's the only thing
keeping me...

535
00:53:42,142 --> 00:53:45,077
from rippin' this fuckin'
precinct to the ground.

536
00:53:45,112 --> 00:53:48,013
That... and this.

537
00:53:49,516 --> 00:53:52,508
Assholes were in such a hurry
to get moving...

538
00:53:52,552 --> 00:53:54,679
they didn't check
the bodies for wires.

539
00:53:56,556 --> 00:53:57,716
Who's on it?

540
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,557
Benny Wong.

541
00:54:03,196 --> 00:54:04,424
A few others.

542
00:54:06,433 --> 00:54:08,025
Three weeks worth
of undercover work.

543
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:15,365
A court would never admit it
without the agent backing it up.

544
00:54:15,409 --> 00:54:17,934
Yeah,they will
once you tell them...

545
00:54:17,978 --> 00:54:20,913
you've been working
with us on this...

546
00:54:20,947 --> 00:54:23,040
that after the shooting
and before the chase...

547
00:54:23,083 --> 00:54:26,280
you entered the building.

548
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,685
You approached our agent,
who with his last breath...

549
00:54:28,722 --> 00:54:33,091
told you he got this tape
and corroborated what's on it.

550
00:54:35,662 --> 00:54:38,756
That's perjury.
Why would I do that?

551
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:40,266
Why?

552
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,928
To keep me from bringing
charges against you...

553
00:54:42,969 --> 00:54:45,130
for obstructing
a federal investigation.

554
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,273
Yeah, Wallace told us
how you engaged...

555
00:54:49,309 --> 00:54:52,073
in the unauthorized surveillance
of a federal agent...

556
00:54:52,112 --> 00:54:55,309
which possibly blew his cover,
resulting in his assassination.

557
00:54:56,917 --> 00:55:00,250
That speech may have
shivered a rookie...

558
00:55:00,287 --> 00:55:02,016
but you need better for me.

559
00:55:02,055 --> 00:55:03,386
I'll tell you what.

560
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,687
You better watch your back
'cause my guts still tell me...

561
00:55:05,725 --> 00:55:07,590
somebody in the 15th
gave my guy up.

562
00:55:07,627 --> 00:55:10,755
And if I can't have Uncle Benny,
then I'm gonna fuckin' have him.

563
00:55:15,702 --> 00:55:17,226
Mr. Chen.

564
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,464
Come on. Let's go.

565
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:39,785
You alone?

566
00:55:42,195 --> 00:55:44,459
Then ask me in.

567
00:55:44,498 --> 00:55:45,829
You wanna come in?

568
00:55:52,472 --> 00:55:53,632
What's goin' on?

569
00:55:54,674 --> 00:55:55,971
Got something to drink?

570
00:55:59,779 --> 00:56:01,804
I haven't gone shopping yet.

571
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:10,078
About yesterday...
you saved my life out there.

572
00:56:10,123 --> 00:56:13,115
It's part of the job.

573
00:56:13,159 --> 00:56:17,755
Maybe...but I still want
to say thank you.

574
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:22,824
You know what it means now
I've saved your life, right?

575
00:56:27,407 --> 00:56:30,570
This is America.
It doesn't mean anything.

576
00:56:32,245 --> 00:56:36,011
So... feds getting you nervous?

577
00:56:36,049 --> 00:56:38,279
No, not at all.

578
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:40,013
Good.

579
00:56:40,053 --> 00:56:45,081
'Cause whether it's the feds,
Internal Affairs, who ever...

580
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:47,889
the inside of a cop car
is sacred.

581
00:56:47,928 --> 00:56:51,864
You don't tell them what we do
unless you come to me first.

582
00:56:51,898 --> 00:56:53,729
Why the sudden paranoia?

583
00:56:53,767 --> 00:56:56,702
I'm just saying no more
talking with the feds...

584
00:56:56,736 --> 00:56:59,762
until we are working
off the same page.

585
00:56:59,806 --> 00:57:01,068
Yeah, sure.

586
00:57:01,107 --> 00:57:03,007
Good.

587
00:57:11,484 --> 00:57:13,577
Do you even have water?

588
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,144
Regular water, yeah.

589
00:57:15,188 --> 00:57:16,985
Please.

590
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,519
Thank you.

591
00:57:50,624 --> 00:57:53,286
Nice looking girl.

592
00:57:58,231 --> 00:58:00,825
Do you know she's in
the country illegally?

593
00:58:04,571 --> 00:58:07,870
Gonna have to send her back...

594
00:58:07,907 --> 00:58:10,933
after a little jail time,
of course.

595
00:58:12,412 --> 00:58:15,643
Shame you two will never
see each other again.

596
00:58:15,682 --> 00:58:18,378
You can't send her.

597
00:58:18,418 --> 00:58:21,114
She's in trouble there.

598
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:23,384
She'll be sent to prison.

599
00:58:23,423 --> 00:58:25,152
Too bad.

600
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:29,925
I can't help you.

601
00:58:29,963 --> 00:58:34,229
That's what you told me,
isn't it?

602
00:58:34,267 --> 00:58:37,794
I help you when they move me.

603
00:58:37,837 --> 00:58:40,567
She comes, too, with papers.

604
00:58:46,179 --> 00:58:48,113
My pager number.

605
00:58:48,148 --> 00:58:51,549
Punch one-one after your number
so I know it's you.

606
00:58:54,688 --> 00:58:59,125
I get you out,
you better not run on me.

607
00:59:02,829 --> 00:59:07,960
I want who ever shot that
undercover fed on this tape.

608
00:59:08,001 --> 00:59:12,529
And I want to know
if he talks to Henry Lee.

609
01:00:01,087 --> 01:00:05,490
Thank you... for the money.

610
01:00:05,525 --> 01:00:08,460
They sent a guy.

611
01:00:09,596 --> 01:00:14,056
You must've really
put something on the line.

612
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,068
I'm not gonna forget that.

613
01:00:26,546 --> 01:00:28,741
-Hello, Officer.
-Did you cover my father?

614
01:00:28,782 --> 01:00:31,649
-Tea?
-I asked you a question.

615
01:00:31,684 --> 01:00:35,245
I want to help you
because I want you to help me.

616
01:00:35,288 --> 01:00:36,812
What do you mean help you?

617
01:00:38,258 --> 01:00:40,249
My business is victimless.

618
01:00:40,293 --> 01:00:42,261
I supply services people want.

619
01:00:42,295 --> 01:00:44,229
And I'm forbidden to them
by politicians.

620
01:00:44,264 --> 01:00:47,495
However, there are those whose
business is not victimless...

621
01:00:47,534 --> 01:00:50,094
whose tactic is violence.

622
01:00:50,136 --> 01:00:52,730
I can help you rid Chinatown
of those elements...

623
01:00:52,772 --> 01:00:55,969
and help keep your father alive.

624
01:00:56,009 --> 01:01:00,412
All I ask is that you look out
for my interests in return.

625
01:01:00,446 --> 01:01:02,812
I think you're asking
for more than that.

626
01:01:05,485 --> 01:01:07,749
Long after you and I are gone...

627
01:01:07,787 --> 01:01:11,086
there will be gambling
in Chinatown.

628
01:01:11,124 --> 01:01:16,152
There will be men waiting
to pay a woman for her favors.

629
01:01:16,196 --> 01:01:18,391
And the police will always
be the last to know.

630
01:01:18,431 --> 01:01:20,865
That's a fact.

631
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,664
You can chase your tail
in the dark...

632
01:01:23,703 --> 01:01:25,728
and accomplish nothing...

633
01:01:25,772 --> 01:01:29,674
or you can really
do some good...

634
01:01:29,709 --> 01:01:32,473
for the people of Chinatown...

635
01:01:32,512 --> 01:01:34,878
for your career...

636
01:01:34,914 --> 01:01:37,041
and for yourfather.

637
01:01:41,654 --> 01:01:43,417
Think of how many
more young women...

638
01:01:43,456 --> 01:01:45,219
would have ended up
in Dumpsters...

639
01:01:45,258 --> 01:01:47,852
if not for your acceptance
of my help.

640
01:01:54,968 --> 01:01:56,595
Do we have a deal?

641
01:01:58,304 --> 01:02:01,637
Or should I call the Italians
and rescind my offer...

642
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:04,040
and let them
deal with your father?

643
01:02:10,183 --> 01:02:11,844
Good.

644
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:16,215
There's something I'd like you
to do for me tomorrow morning.

645
01:02:17,457 --> 01:02:19,152
There's a tin shop on Mott.

646
01:02:20,493 --> 01:02:22,654
A Malaysian runs it.

647
01:02:22,695 --> 01:02:24,526
Tomorrow morning at six a.m.

648
01:02:24,564 --> 01:02:28,056
He'll be receiving two bricks
of heroin from a Colombian.

649
01:02:29,669 --> 01:02:31,398
These men are scum.

650
01:02:31,437 --> 01:02:33,268
They deal to children.

651
01:02:34,474 --> 01:02:36,738
I want you to stop them.

652
01:03:44,644 --> 01:03:46,305
Freeze! Police!

653
01:03:55,455 --> 01:03:57,980
You son of a bitch.

654
01:03:58,024 --> 01:04:00,185
When did Lee approach you?

655
01:04:00,226 --> 01:04:01,853
The bust from Christie, right?

656
01:04:04,163 --> 01:04:06,063
I knew your story
was full of shit.

657
01:04:06,099 --> 01:04:07,657
When did he approach you?

658
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,600
I bet it was quite
a while before that.

659
01:04:09,635 --> 01:04:11,762
When was it, two years ago,
five years ago?

660
01:04:11,804 --> 01:04:15,001
How long have you been working
for him, or can you remember?

661
01:04:16,075 --> 01:04:17,599
You are dead.

662
01:04:17,643 --> 01:04:19,577
Your life is over.

663
01:04:19,612 --> 01:04:23,309
I thought you were smart,
but you are not.

664
01:04:23,349 --> 01:04:25,180
You're as dumb as they come.

665
01:04:27,787 --> 01:04:29,846
You gave him that FBI agent,
didn't you?

666
01:04:29,889 --> 01:04:32,756
That's why you pressed that kid
so hard to wear the wire.

667
01:04:32,792 --> 01:04:34,760
You wanted to know
if it was the Fukes...

668
01:04:34,794 --> 01:04:37,194
that killed that agent
or if it was Henry Lee.

669
01:04:46,305 --> 01:04:47,602
We had a deal.

670
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:50,575
You brought him in, not me.

671
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:52,544
I couldn't risk it.

672
01:04:52,578 --> 01:04:53,772
Let him go.

673
01:04:53,813 --> 01:04:55,212
What's done is done.

674
01:04:55,248 --> 01:04:57,443
You know that
better than anyone.

675
01:04:57,483 --> 01:04:58,882
You want to help him?

676
01:04:58,918 --> 01:05:00,385
Smarten him up...

677
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:04,322
make sure he doesn't trip
on his toes and fuck you both.

678
01:05:04,357 --> 01:05:07,485
I hear dirty cops have
an extra rough time in prison.

679
01:05:12,732 --> 01:05:17,294
I find out you killed the fed,
I'll kill you.

680
01:05:32,118 --> 01:05:35,087
Choose it, choose it.
Black or red plum?

681
01:05:35,121 --> 01:05:36,418
I don't like plums.

682
01:05:36,456 --> 01:05:38,219
What do you mean
you don't like plums?

683
01:05:38,257 --> 01:05:39,554
I like peaches.

684
01:05:39,592 --> 01:05:41,492
Peaches are shit.

685
01:05:41,527 --> 01:05:43,893
Haven't you ever heard
the song Sinatra sang?

686
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:47,058
Out of the tree of life,
I just picked me a plum.

687
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,328
Not a peach, a plum.

688
01:05:48,367 --> 01:05:49,698
I don't care
if he picked a raisin...

689
01:05:49,735 --> 01:05:52,898
out of Sammy Davis' eye socket,
I prefer peaches.

690
01:05:54,273 --> 01:05:56,070
Then I'm not paying for it.

691
01:06:03,549 --> 01:06:06,382
So when did Lee get to you?

692
01:06:06,419 --> 01:06:09,582
I was the first
Chinese cop in the 15th.

693
01:06:09,622 --> 01:06:11,817
Thought I was gonna
clean up Chinatown.

694
01:06:11,858 --> 01:06:14,850
But white cops
wouldn't work with me.

695
01:06:14,894 --> 01:06:18,125
And the people wouldn't
talk to a cop, Chinese or not.

696
01:06:18,164 --> 01:06:20,758
Only Benny Wong
would talk to me.

697
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,792
He took me around,
took care of my debts...

698
01:06:23,836 --> 01:06:26,031
fed me a few busts.

699
01:06:26,072 --> 01:06:28,404
Made me look good and I like it.

700
01:06:28,441 --> 01:06:30,932
Then he became my godfather.

701
01:06:30,977 --> 01:06:33,707
At that time,
Henry Lee was nothing.

702
01:06:35,882 --> 01:06:38,282
One night my father
walks into a gambling house...

703
01:06:38,317 --> 01:06:39,648
and ends up dead.

704
01:06:41,587 --> 01:06:44,112
Turns out, Lee knew
there was a contract on him.

705
01:06:46,025 --> 01:06:48,619
He made it clear...
he could have told me.

706
01:06:48,661 --> 01:06:50,822
I could have saved him.

707
01:06:50,863 --> 01:06:53,855
Got me thinking I was better
at my job with him...

708
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,925
than without him.

709
01:06:55,968 --> 01:06:57,299
And he was right.

710
01:07:00,339 --> 01:07:01,863
Give me everything
you got on this guy.

711
01:07:01,908 --> 01:07:03,808
Detective in the 15th precinct.

712
01:07:03,843 --> 01:07:05,572
His name is Daniel Wallace.

713
01:07:05,611 --> 01:07:07,374
His old man went crooked
out of the two-five.

714
01:07:07,413 --> 01:07:08,744
Check on him, too.

715
01:07:15,855 --> 01:07:20,053
Mr. Wong...
we're running a one-day sale.

716
01:07:20,092 --> 01:07:21,650
Chance of a lifetime.

717
01:07:21,694 --> 01:07:24,663
The opportunity
to buy your freedom.

718
01:07:24,697 --> 01:07:26,358
This tape was obtained...

719
01:07:26,399 --> 01:07:29,266
by a federal agent working
undercover inside the Tong.

720
01:07:37,043 --> 01:07:39,170
Patience has paid off.

721
01:07:39,212 --> 01:07:42,613
Uncle Benny
made a visit to the FBI.

722
01:07:42,648 --> 01:07:44,479
His time is over.

723
01:07:44,517 --> 01:07:45,950
Good.

724
01:07:49,322 --> 01:07:52,120
-We've got a job.
-What is it?

725
01:07:53,626 --> 01:07:56,493
We take care of
Benny Wong tonight.

726
01:07:56,529 --> 01:07:58,156
Come on, let's go.

727
01:08:05,938 --> 01:08:08,406
My friends are waiting for me.

728
01:08:10,876 --> 01:08:13,436
How long do you think the feds
are gonna be watching us?

729
01:08:13,479 --> 01:08:16,880
Month. Maybe two.

730
01:08:20,486 --> 01:08:23,250
I didn't want Lee involving you.

731
01:08:23,289 --> 01:08:25,086
It's not your fault.

732
01:08:25,124 --> 01:08:27,718
What I'm saying
is that you are alone now.

733
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:30,092
You can't trust anybody
in the department...

734
01:08:30,129 --> 01:08:32,620
no other guys in the 15th...

735
01:08:32,665 --> 01:08:34,428
not the guys in A.G.U.

736
01:08:35,635 --> 01:08:39,093
And you sure can't trust
Henry Lee.

737
01:08:39,138 --> 01:08:41,663
So if anything gets sticky,
you come to me.

738
01:08:43,175 --> 01:08:45,006
How do I know I can trust you?

739
01:08:46,946 --> 01:08:48,208
You don't.

740
01:08:50,149 --> 01:08:53,016
I know this might sound crazy,
but I'm glad it's not just me.

741
01:08:55,955 --> 01:08:58,253
You hungry?
I could buy you a plum.

742
01:09:00,926 --> 01:09:02,484
I got plans.

743
01:09:03,663 --> 01:09:05,756
Maybe next time.

744
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:09,767
Next time. Thanks.

745
01:09:57,850 --> 01:09:59,249
I gotta take a leak, man.

746
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:27,338
She's lucky you found her.

747
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:35,416
I want you to write her up
as a deceased.

748
01:10:35,454 --> 01:10:37,422
She recovers, she go to work.

749
01:10:37,456 --> 01:10:41,153
Two weeks later, she back
in here maybe not so lucky.

750
01:10:41,193 --> 01:10:42,683
You're asking a lot.

751
01:10:52,338 --> 01:10:55,865
Let her stay here a few days.
Then I come to get her.

752
01:10:57,009 --> 01:10:59,341
The fuck are you doing?

753
01:11:02,214 --> 01:11:07,379
I'm sick. I wasn't sure if I had
to go back inside or not.

754
01:11:14,593 --> 01:11:16,686
I'm all right, man, let's go.

755
01:11:19,398 --> 01:11:22,834
The fuck's going on here, man?
Let's get out of here.

756
01:11:25,204 --> 01:11:27,138
Is this Domino's pizza?

757
01:11:30,209 --> 01:11:33,303
Jack thought
he was gonna shit his pants.

758
01:12:13,919 --> 01:12:17,650
You kill me?
You not man enough, huh?

759
01:12:23,329 --> 01:12:25,024
We kill you anyway.

760
01:12:47,286 --> 01:12:48,776
Where are you going?

761
01:12:48,821 --> 01:12:51,756
Lee's not covering my dad with
the Italians, so I gotta move.

762
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:53,121
I told him to stop.

763
01:12:53,158 --> 01:12:54,955
Why the hell did you do that?

764
01:12:54,994 --> 01:12:57,724
'Cause the feds are building
a case against you.

765
01:12:57,763 --> 01:12:59,788
-How do you know?
-Lee told me.

766
01:12:59,832 --> 01:13:01,026
If they nabbed you...

767
01:13:01,066 --> 01:13:03,193
it would take three seconds
for you to give them me.

768
01:13:03,235 --> 01:13:05,829
-I would never do that.
-I'm not saying it's fatal.

769
01:13:05,871 --> 01:13:07,361
The point now
is to cover tracks...

770
01:13:07,406 --> 01:13:10,102
and keep everything clean
on the surface.

771
01:13:10,142 --> 01:13:12,975
When they call you in,
keep your mouth shut.

772
01:13:19,985 --> 01:13:23,011
This is your cut from me.
Four grand.

773
01:13:24,523 --> 01:13:26,457
I gotta get to the hospital.

774
01:13:29,595 --> 01:13:32,462
-Where are you gonna move him?
-I don't know.

775
01:13:38,737 --> 01:13:41,467
-To cover your old man.
-I can't.

776
01:13:42,975 --> 01:13:44,203
Just take it.

777
01:13:46,979 --> 01:13:48,412
Thanks.

778
01:13:50,382 --> 01:13:53,146
Remember, don't say anything.

779
01:13:53,185 --> 01:13:55,585
Let me deal with the FBI,
all right?

780
01:14:14,673 --> 01:14:16,607
Hard to find,Jack.

781
01:14:17,743 --> 01:14:20,211
Tell her to take in a movie.

782
01:14:20,245 --> 01:14:22,236
Go on!

783
01:14:22,281 --> 01:14:24,408
I wanted to call. I couldn't.

784
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:26,384
And I'm here.

785
01:14:26,418 --> 01:14:29,319
What do you want to tell me
about Benny Wong?

786
01:14:30,489 --> 01:14:34,016
Daniel Wallace, FBI.

787
01:14:34,059 --> 01:14:36,527
Hi, could you pass that letter
off to my father?

788
01:14:36,562 --> 01:14:38,291
He's in 409. Sean Wallace.

789
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:40,730
-Back off. What's going on?
-Don't be an ass.

790
01:14:40,766 --> 01:14:43,098
Don't touch my gun or badge.
I'm active in the 15th.

791
01:14:43,135 --> 01:14:46,468
Fine. Let's just get out of here
real quietly.

792
01:14:46,505 --> 01:14:49,201
Just got a few questions
we'd like to ask you.

793
01:14:49,241 --> 01:14:50,606
I got my father--

794
01:14:50,643 --> 01:14:52,304
We'll put someone on the door.

795
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,942
Pass it. Thank you.

796
01:14:57,983 --> 01:14:59,678
Then everybody took off?

797
01:15:01,053 --> 01:15:02,213
Good.

798
01:15:03,322 --> 01:15:05,187
You come with me.

799
01:15:05,224 --> 01:15:06,714
Where?

800
01:15:06,759 --> 01:15:09,819
To tell the feds
you work with Wallace and me.

801
01:15:09,862 --> 01:15:11,796
That the hit on Benny Wong
was Fukienese.

802
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:14,560
And you're eager to testify
against Bobby Vu.

803
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:18,058
Do it right, I'll back you on
trying to tip me before a hit.

804
01:15:18,103 --> 01:15:21,903
Do it wrong,
I go out of my way to bury you.

805
01:15:49,835 --> 01:15:52,895
Why the fuck didn't you tell me
you were Internal Affairs?

806
01:15:55,541 --> 01:15:57,600
Confidential undercover
assignment, Pete.

807
01:15:57,643 --> 01:16:00,737
Key word being "confidential,"
which nothing in the Bureau is.

808
01:16:00,779 --> 01:16:01,939
Fuck yourself.

809
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:04,039
Nobody knows except
a few of us in I.A.

810
01:16:04,083 --> 01:16:07,644
Not even the commanding officer
in the 15th knows.

811
01:16:07,686 --> 01:16:10,780
Well, now I know.

812
01:16:10,823 --> 01:16:14,520
Bag man's kid.
Internal Affairs.

813
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:17,256
Your old man must think
you're a real scumbag, huh?

814
01:16:26,371 --> 01:16:27,633
So what do you got on Chen?

815
01:16:27,673 --> 01:16:31,507
This isn't a federal case.
No reason to tell you.

816
01:16:31,543 --> 01:16:35,172
No, there is, actually.
From where I'm sitting...

817
01:16:35,214 --> 01:16:38,911
it looks like a young I.A. rat
went under to build a case...

818
01:16:38,951 --> 01:16:41,146
against Nick Chen
and ended up working for him.

819
01:16:41,186 --> 01:16:42,153
You're reaching.

820
01:16:42,187 --> 01:16:44,712
Enjoying the Chinatown whores...

821
01:16:44,757 --> 01:16:48,215
and financial assistance to help
a family gambling problem.

822
01:16:48,260 --> 01:16:49,557
Don't start with that.

823
01:16:49,595 --> 01:16:52,223
I'll start and finish with it
unless somebody hands me Chen.

824
01:16:52,264 --> 01:16:54,596
-He's here.
-Who's here?

825
01:17:06,812 --> 01:17:08,712
Who's your friend?

826
01:17:08,747 --> 01:17:10,977
A buddy of Wallace's and mine.

827
01:17:11,016 --> 01:17:14,952
He's an eyewitness
to the Benny Wong murder.

828
01:17:14,987 --> 01:17:16,318
Peanut?

829
01:17:18,991 --> 01:17:23,155
Eyewitness? And you bring him
here to me, why?

830
01:17:29,368 --> 01:17:31,233
You know why.

831
01:17:34,072 --> 01:17:36,700
My compliments,Wallace.

832
01:17:36,742 --> 01:17:40,109
You must've sunk your hooks
into Chen pretty good, huh?

833
01:17:40,145 --> 01:17:42,807
-What did he want?
-To trade for you.

834
01:17:42,848 --> 01:17:44,213
He said that?

835
01:17:44,249 --> 01:17:47,047
Not in so many words.

836
01:17:47,085 --> 01:17:48,575
He brought
that Fuke snitch of yours...

837
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:51,282
who rode shot gun
on the Benny Wong killing.

838
01:17:51,323 --> 01:17:52,585
He gives me the eyewitness...

839
01:17:52,624 --> 01:17:55,184
I call off the FBI investigation
on Wallace.

840
01:17:55,227 --> 01:17:57,388
What'd you tell him?

841
01:18:00,432 --> 01:18:02,525
I told him fine.

842
01:18:02,568 --> 01:18:03,830
Putting the kid
back on the street...

843
01:18:03,869 --> 01:18:05,564
to get the rest of the Fukes
on tape...

844
01:18:05,604 --> 01:18:07,868
talking about the hit
on Benny Wong.

845
01:18:07,906 --> 01:18:09,373
And in return...

846
01:18:09,408 --> 01:18:12,571
I'm not gonna press charges
on young Wallace here.

847
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:16,705
-Is Chen still here?
-He took off.

848
01:18:16,748 --> 01:18:19,979
But you gotta promise me
that I can be there.

849
01:18:20,018 --> 01:18:22,646
When you break
the bad news to Chen...

850
01:18:22,688 --> 01:18:25,179
because that's fucking
gonna be fucking priceless.

851
01:19:10,769 --> 01:19:12,498
Your wire's showing.

852
01:19:14,406 --> 01:19:16,601
How long you been I.A.?

853
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:20,705
First assignment.

854
01:19:20,746 --> 01:19:22,270
Quickest way to a gold shield...

855
01:19:22,314 --> 01:19:24,908
and all you gotta do
is bury your partner.

856
01:19:26,618 --> 01:19:29,883
The guy who shoved
10 grand into your fist...

857
01:19:29,922 --> 01:19:33,050
to back your play.

858
01:19:33,091 --> 01:19:36,219
I figure you ain't worth
much to the chinks, yet.

859
01:19:36,261 --> 01:19:41,824
So, this... must be Chen's money.

860
01:19:41,867 --> 01:19:45,359
And you're gonna bury him.

861
01:19:45,404 --> 01:19:47,372
And for what?

862
01:19:47,406 --> 01:19:49,397
Turning his head?

863
01:19:49,441 --> 01:19:51,432
Making a few dollars?

864
01:19:51,476 --> 01:19:54,639
I know it wouldn't mean
much to you, Pop.

865
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:56,841
Lying and cheating
is what you're made of.

866
01:19:56,882 --> 01:19:59,817
That's a hell of a lot better
than what you're made of.

867
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:04,655
You don't even know
what I'm made of, Pop.

868
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:07,124
It's the one thing
I should thank you for.

869
01:20:07,159 --> 01:20:09,059
Your lack of interest.

870
01:20:10,762 --> 01:20:13,390
You've been real honest
with your partner.

871
01:20:13,432 --> 01:20:16,060
Ends justify the means, Pop.

872
01:20:16,101 --> 01:20:19,332
The ends is bullshit.

873
01:20:19,371 --> 01:20:24,866
The means...
is what you live with.

874
01:20:30,983 --> 01:20:32,746
Keep it.

875
01:20:32,784 --> 01:20:34,547
I don't want nothing from you.

876
01:21:37,382 --> 01:21:39,282
Wait, wait, wait.

877
01:21:39,317 --> 01:21:40,784
Don't you like me?

878
01:21:40,819 --> 01:21:43,481
Of course. I just need
to go to the bathroom.

879
01:21:53,665 --> 01:21:55,394
Shit.

880
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:03,867
What the fuck are you doing?

881
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:23,355
Where's the lieutenant?

882
01:22:23,395 --> 01:22:24,521
He left.

883
01:22:24,563 --> 01:22:26,895
He said he wanted you
to be very happy.

884
01:22:45,984 --> 01:22:47,884
The police
are running in circles...

885
01:22:47,919 --> 01:22:50,945
on the unfortunate death
of Uncle Benny.

886
01:22:50,989 --> 01:22:52,354
Uncle Benny, yeah.

887
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:54,620
We didn't kill him for nothing.
Give us the money.

888
01:22:54,659 --> 01:22:56,752
Then it's time to bring
the cargo ship to port...

889
01:22:56,795 --> 01:22:58,729
and unload our freight.

890
01:22:58,763 --> 01:23:01,459
One hundred eighty-six
at forty thousand a piece.

891
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:04,560
I'd say that's a nice start
to our relationship.

892
01:23:04,603 --> 01:23:05,763
Shit, yeah!

893
01:23:15,981 --> 01:23:17,949
Hot tea.

894
01:24:08,133 --> 01:24:10,499
The only time
I was ever in here...

895
01:24:10,535 --> 01:24:12,400
I was talking to my godfather.

896
01:24:12,437 --> 01:24:14,405
Uncle Benny was a great man.

897
01:24:14,439 --> 01:24:16,407
You would know better
than anyone.

898
01:24:16,441 --> 01:24:20,468
But even a great man
can outlast his time.

899
01:24:20,512 --> 01:24:22,503
I've got something for you.

900
01:24:22,547 --> 01:24:25,482
Should quiet any doubts
as to Wallace's character.

901
01:24:25,517 --> 01:24:29,146
The Fukes are bringing in
a highly valuable cargo by ship.

902
01:24:29,187 --> 01:24:32,213
Bobby Vu will be on site
supervising the unloading.

903
01:24:32,257 --> 01:24:34,725
Take the Fukes
and half the cargo.

904
01:24:34,759 --> 01:24:36,954
I'll keep the other half.

905
01:24:36,995 --> 01:24:39,429
You're getting greedy.

906
01:24:40,932 --> 01:24:42,695
I'm an American.

907
01:24:44,703 --> 01:24:46,500
Hey! Let's go.

908
01:24:46,538 --> 01:24:50,167
We gotta pick up Jack
and send him to the feds.

909
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:51,641
What time is it?

910
01:24:51,676 --> 01:24:54,110
Time for a shower. You stink.

911
01:24:56,214 --> 01:24:57,943
Got a match?

912
01:25:06,157 --> 01:25:07,784
You know, you were right.

913
01:25:09,027 --> 01:25:10,221
About what?

914
01:25:10,262 --> 01:25:12,560
I wish it was neither of us...

915
01:25:12,597 --> 01:25:16,328
but the fact is,
I'm glad it's not just me.

916
01:25:17,969 --> 01:25:19,436
Get up!

917
01:25:44,696 --> 01:25:46,664
You sure it was Henry Lee?

918
01:25:47,766 --> 01:25:48,926
It was him.

919
01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:53,797
I think everybody here knows...

920
01:25:53,838 --> 01:25:57,205
Assistant U.S. Attorney
Margaret Wheeler.

921
01:25:57,242 --> 01:25:59,472
Gentlemen, tape's good...

922
01:25:59,511 --> 01:26:01,706
probably enough for convictions
on Bobby Vu and the rest...

923
01:26:01,746 --> 01:26:03,441
but I think we hold off...

924
01:26:03,481 --> 01:26:06,917
till they make their move to
bring in the illegal shipment.

925
01:26:06,951 --> 01:26:08,578
We bust them on the ship.

926
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:10,588
Then we go for
the murder charge...

927
01:26:10,622 --> 01:26:13,284
Jack connects the dots to an
ongoing criminal enterprise...

928
01:26:13,325 --> 01:26:14,622
we get life sentences.

929
01:26:14,659 --> 01:26:17,594
-What about Henry Lee?
-What about him?

930
01:26:17,629 --> 01:26:18,994
Do we have a case, Pete?

931
01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:21,328
Enough to drag Mr. Lee
before a grand jury...

932
01:26:21,366 --> 01:26:23,732
but then it's his word against
their word, and he'll win.

933
01:26:23,768 --> 01:26:27,363
After the shipment comes in,
the tape's got merit.

934
01:26:27,405 --> 01:26:29,339
Daniel, what are your thoughts?

935
01:26:30,342 --> 01:26:33,539
-It's Margaret's call.
-Then we wait.

936
01:26:33,578 --> 01:26:35,205
Everybody works round the clock.

937
01:26:35,246 --> 01:26:38,113
As soon as Jack finds out
when delivery is set...

938
01:26:38,149 --> 01:26:40,811
we'll reconvene
and make the arrests.

939
01:26:40,852 --> 01:26:42,183
That's it, gentlemen.

940
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:44,188
-Thank you.
-Pleasure.

941
01:26:44,222 --> 01:26:48,488
Nick, what do you say after
we bust the Fuke Dragons...

942
01:26:48,526 --> 01:26:51,154
we all get together,
bury the hatchet, huh?

943
01:26:51,196 --> 01:26:52,458
Can't wait.

944
01:26:52,497 --> 01:26:54,795
Danny, you up for that?

945
01:26:54,833 --> 01:26:56,095
Yeah. Sure.

946
01:26:56,134 --> 01:26:57,533
Good.

947
01:27:03,942 --> 01:27:05,239
Bacardi and Coke.

948
01:27:05,276 --> 01:27:06,766
Get a Bud.

949
01:27:06,811 --> 01:27:08,005
I got it.

950
01:27:16,321 --> 01:27:18,312
I gave the fed to Lee.

951
01:27:20,425 --> 01:27:21,585
I know.

952
01:27:25,497 --> 01:27:28,466
I'm gonna have to answer
for him someday.

953
01:27:29,701 --> 01:27:32,135
We all have something
to answer for.

954
01:27:42,447 --> 01:27:43,812
Speak of the devil.

955
01:27:45,817 --> 01:27:47,250
Order me another.

956
01:27:50,922 --> 01:27:52,082
It's Chen.

957
01:27:53,858 --> 01:27:56,418
Been paging you all day.

958
01:27:56,461 --> 01:27:57,792
What do you want?

959
01:27:57,829 --> 01:28:00,263
Wallace is Internal Affairs.

960
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:05,135
-What?
-You heard me.

961
01:28:05,170 --> 01:28:06,467
I don't believe it.

962
01:28:06,504 --> 01:28:08,938
Your girl friends found a wire
on him last night.

963
01:28:08,973 --> 01:28:10,770
I checked it out...

964
01:28:10,809 --> 01:28:13,141
and the fuck is making a case
against you.

965
01:28:13,178 --> 01:28:14,338
You there?

966
01:28:15,814 --> 01:28:18,112
Who knows how long he was wired.

967
01:28:18,149 --> 01:28:20,709
He's gotta go.
You kill him tonight.

968
01:28:20,752 --> 01:28:23,380
The Fukes are taking delivery
in one hour...

969
01:28:23,421 --> 01:28:25,719
pier 25 at Port Imperial
in Jersey...

970
01:28:25,757 --> 01:28:27,315
a ship called the Durian.

971
01:28:27,358 --> 01:28:29,986
Take him along, make sure
he doesn't leave the boat.

972
01:28:30,028 --> 01:28:31,256
You understand me?

973
01:28:31,296 --> 01:28:33,730
I don't give a shit about
the cargo, the Fukes--nothing.

974
01:28:33,765 --> 01:28:36,495
Just make sure Wallace is dead.
Are we clear?!

975
01:28:38,136 --> 01:28:39,763
He'll hang us both.

976
01:28:43,007 --> 01:28:44,372
I understand.

977
01:29:44,802 --> 01:29:46,599
You get ahold of him?

978
01:29:48,172 --> 01:29:50,436
You tell him about the tape?

979
01:29:52,777 --> 01:29:54,438
Well, what did he say?

980
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:57,039
He wanted to tell me
that the Fukes...

981
01:29:57,081 --> 01:30:00,539
are picking up the shipment
in an hour in Jersey.

982
01:30:00,585 --> 01:30:02,780
Shit, we gotta move.
Did you call the feds?

983
01:30:05,924 --> 01:30:07,585
They're gonna meet us there.

984
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:09,752
Well, let's go.

985
01:30:34,285 --> 01:30:36,344
No sign of anybody.

986
01:30:39,557 --> 01:30:40,683
Have a look.

987
01:30:40,725 --> 01:30:42,420
Lee said an hour, right?

988
01:30:55,173 --> 01:30:56,470
Still nothing?

989
01:30:59,510 --> 01:31:00,636
Are you sure?

990
01:31:01,646 --> 01:31:03,910
Yep. It's all clear.

991
01:31:06,551 --> 01:31:08,451
What about Internal Affairs?

992
01:31:10,054 --> 01:31:11,180
What?

993
01:31:11,222 --> 01:31:13,383
I forget to mention...

994
01:31:13,424 --> 01:31:16,985
Lee thinks they're making a case
against someone in the 15th.

995
01:31:17,996 --> 01:31:20,863
-Who?
-He didn't know.

996
01:31:20,898 --> 01:31:23,196
Maybe it's just a rumor.

997
01:31:24,869 --> 01:31:26,268
You hear anything?

998
01:31:28,773 --> 01:31:31,765
-They're here.
-You keep watching.

999
01:31:45,523 --> 01:31:48,686
We got to let them
lead us to the cargo.

1000
01:31:55,299 --> 01:31:57,324
They're heading away from us.

1001
01:32:04,175 --> 01:32:08,077
What would you do if you knew
L.A. had a case against you?

1002
01:32:10,014 --> 01:32:12,744
I don't know.

1003
01:32:12,784 --> 01:32:17,221
What if you knew your partner
gave you up, amigo?

1004
01:32:26,364 --> 01:32:29,060
Answer me! I'm asking you!

1005
01:32:31,335 --> 01:32:32,597
I don't know.

1006
01:32:34,405 --> 01:32:37,738
You should have let me die
in the car that day.

1007
01:32:37,775 --> 01:32:40,107
At least then, I die a cop.

1008
01:32:41,612 --> 01:32:43,409
You are a cop.

1009
01:32:45,383 --> 01:32:46,714
You're a good cop.

1010
01:32:47,885 --> 01:32:50,353
I tell that to anybody
that asks me.

1011
01:32:50,388 --> 01:32:51,514
And you?

1012
01:32:51,556 --> 01:32:54,081
I don't know.

1013
01:32:54,125 --> 01:32:57,185
All I know is
you saved me and my father.

1014
01:32:57,228 --> 01:33:00,527
My life is really yours
to do with as you wish.

1015
01:34:51,275 --> 01:34:52,708
Shit!

1016
01:38:46,243 --> 01:38:47,676
Mou mantai.

1017
01:38:50,414 --> 01:38:52,109
Come here.

1018
01:39:05,062 --> 01:39:07,087
Maybe that's all of 'em.

1019
01:39:07,131 --> 01:39:08,598
Bobby Vu is here.

1020
01:39:08,632 --> 01:39:10,964
He would never leave without us.

1021
01:39:11,001 --> 01:39:12,696
You mean without you.

1022
01:39:21,979 --> 01:39:23,207
M'eh a?

1023
01:39:25,282 --> 01:39:26,442
Where?

1024
01:39:26,484 --> 01:39:28,111
Come here.

1025
01:39:36,227 --> 01:39:38,024
Fuck you!

1026
01:40:00,084 --> 01:40:02,382
Shit. Hold on.

1027
01:40:04,088 --> 01:40:06,613
You all right? You OK?

1028
01:40:09,226 --> 01:40:11,285
I'm so sorry.

1029
01:40:17,701 --> 01:40:21,797
Who sends a white cop
undercover in Chinatown?

1030
01:40:21,839 --> 01:40:25,138
I swear to God
I wish they never did.

1031
01:40:28,112 --> 01:40:30,046
Nick, can you hear me?

1032
01:40:35,686 --> 01:40:38,018
Bring a fucking stretcher now!

1033
01:40:44,061 --> 01:40:45,722
It's just you and me.

1034
01:40:48,599 --> 01:40:51,090
I'm your partner. Please.

1035
01:40:53,904 --> 01:40:55,337
Where's the stretcher?!

1036
01:40:57,474 --> 01:40:59,135
Nick, you gotta hold on.

1037
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:30,230
Can we get Wallace out here?

1038
01:41:34,511 --> 01:41:37,002
You want to get Wallace
out here, please? Now.

1039
01:41:52,162 --> 01:41:54,426
What is this bullshit?

1040
01:41:54,465 --> 01:41:56,092
Exactly what it says.

1041
01:41:56,133 --> 01:41:58,328
After a month's investigation,
I find no evidence...

1042
01:41:58,369 --> 01:42:01,463
supporting any charges against
Lieutenant Nicholas Chen.

1043
01:42:01,505 --> 01:42:03,700
You think
you can get away with this?

1044
01:42:03,741 --> 01:42:05,231
You can forget it, man.

1045
01:42:05,276 --> 01:42:07,210
He's responsible for the death
of a federal agent.

1046
01:42:07,244 --> 01:42:09,542
The man is dead.

1047
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:10,877
And no matter
what you believe...

1048
01:42:10,914 --> 01:42:13,610
that officer
died a good fucking cop!

1049
01:42:13,651 --> 01:42:14,811
Move.

1050
01:42:33,871 --> 01:42:36,431
Henry Lee...
you're under arrest.

1051
01:42:36,473 --> 01:42:39,067
I'd like to introduce you
to my attorney.

1052
01:42:39,109 --> 01:42:42,408
I'd like to introduce you to
the inmates at Rikers Island...

1053
01:42:42,446 --> 01:42:44,471
but that'll take a few weeks.

1054
01:42:44,515 --> 01:42:46,449
I was very saddened...

1055
01:42:46,483 --> 01:42:49,748
to hear about yourfriend
Lieutenant Chen.

1056
01:42:49,787 --> 01:42:52,620
I'm sorry.

1057
01:42:52,656 --> 01:42:55,318
He wasn't your friend,
after all, was he?

1058
01:42:57,628 --> 01:42:59,255
I'd like to thank you...

1059
01:42:59,296 --> 01:43:01,787
for killing
all the witnesses against me.

1060
01:43:02,866 --> 01:43:06,097
Not all. Not the one
who recorded this tape.

1061
01:43:06,136 --> 01:43:08,400
We didn't kill him for nothing.
Give us the money.

1062
01:43:08,439 --> 01:43:10,873
Then it's time to bring
the cargo ship to port...

1063
01:43:10,908 --> 01:43:13,001
and unload our freight--

1064
01:43:13,043 --> 01:43:15,273
one hundred eighty-six
at forty thousand a piece.

1065
01:43:15,312 --> 01:43:18,804
I'd say that's a nice start
to our relationship.

1066
01:43:18,849 --> 01:43:20,214
Shit, yeah!

1067
01:43:25,022 --> 01:43:28,082
Let's go, hotshot.
You're under arrest.

1068
01:43:28,125 --> 01:43:29,752
You have the right
to remain silent.

1069
01:43:29,793 --> 01:43:30,953
You understand that?

1070
01:43:30,994 --> 01:43:32,928
You have the right to refuse
to answer any questions.

1071
01:43:32,963 --> 01:43:34,260
You understand that?
Anything you say...

1072
01:43:34,298 --> 01:43:36,425
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

1073
01:43:36,467 --> 01:43:37,695
Do you understand that?

1074
01:43:37,735 --> 01:43:40,602
You have the right
to have an attorney present...
