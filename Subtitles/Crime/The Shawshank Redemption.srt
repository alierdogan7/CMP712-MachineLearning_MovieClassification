Mr Dufresne,

19
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:12,089
describe the confrontation you had
with your wife the night she was murdered.

20
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,888
It was very bitter.

21
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:23,351
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around...

22
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:28,356
And she said she wanted a divorce in Reno.

23
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,274
What was your response?

24
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,318
I told her I would not grant one.

25
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,446
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

26
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:39,158
Those were the words you used, Mr Dufresne,
according to your neighbours.

27
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,996
If they say so.
I really don't remember. I was upset.

28
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,626
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

29
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,586
She packed a bag.

30
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,882
She packed a bag to go and stay with...
Mr Quentin.

31
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,260
DA: Glenn Quentin.

32
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,428
Golf pro at the Snowdon Hills Country Club.

33
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:03,349
The man you discovered was your wife's lover.

34
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,477
Did you follow her?

35
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,939
I went to a few bars first.

36
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,900
Later, I drove to his house to confront them.

37
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:16,571
They weren't home, so I...parked in the turnout,

38
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,239
and waited.

39
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,533
DA: With what intention?

40
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,410
DUFRESNE: I'm not sure.

41
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,704
I was confused.

42
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,414
Drunk.

43
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,210
I think...mostly, I wanted to scare them.

44
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,547
When they arrived,
you went up to the house and murdered them.

45
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,717
No. I was sobering up.

46
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,553
I got back in the car,
and I drove home to sleep it off.

47
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,098
Along the way, I stopped,
and I threw my gun into the Royal River.

48
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,392
I feel I've been very clear on this point.

49
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:50,271
Well, where I get hazy is where the cleaning
woman shows up the following morning

50
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:55,985
and finds your wife in bed with her lover,
riddled with .38 calibre bullets.

51
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,324
Now, does that strike you as a fantastic
coincidence, Mr Dufresne, or is it just me?

52
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,242
(Whispers) Yes, it does.

53
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:09,415
Yet you still maintain that you threw your gun
into the river before the murders took place?

54
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:13,294
- That's very convenient.
- It's the truth.

55
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:18,090
DA: The police dragged that river
for three days, and nary a gun was found.

56
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,968
So, there could be no comparison made
between your gun

57
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:25,181
and the bullets taken from
the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

58
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,393
And that also...

59
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,479
is very convenient.

60
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,022
Isn't it, Mr Dufresne?

61
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,525
Since I am innocent of this crime, sir,

62
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,154
I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

We have the accused at the scene of the crime.

69
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,389
We have footprints, tyre tracks,

70
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:10,518
bullets strewn on the ground which bear
his fingerprints, a broken bourbon bottle,

lying dead in each other's arms.

75
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,322
They had sinned.

76
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:28,953
But was their crime so great
as to merit a death sentence?

77
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,206
Now, while you think about that...

78
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,460
..think about this.

79
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,088
A revolver holds six bullets.

80
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,548
Not eight.

81
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:44,093
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded
crime of passion.

82
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,221
That could be understood, if not condoned.

83
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,932
No. This was revenge...

84
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:54,520
of a much more brutal
and cold-blooded nature. Consider this.

85
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,148
Four bullets per victim.

86
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,608
Not six shots fired, but eight.

87
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:03,612
That means that he fired the gun empty,

88
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,948
and then stopped to reload...

89
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,660
..so that he could shoot each of them again.

90
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,329
An extra bullet per lover.

91
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,457
Right in the head.

92
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,376

93
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:23,424

100
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,472
We see by your file
you've served 20 years of a life sentence.

101
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,140
Yes, sir.

102

103
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,937
Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

104
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,524
I mean, I learned my lesson.

105
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:25,861
I can honestly say...I'm a changed man.

106
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,951
I'm no longer a danger to society.

107

Same old shit. Different day.

110
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,456
Yeah. I know how you feel.
I'm up for rejection next week.

111
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,252
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

112
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,628
It happens.

113
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,297
Hey, Red. Bump me a deck.

114
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,758
Get the fuck out of my face, will you, man?
You've had five packs already.

115
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,010
- Four.
- Five.

116
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,639
RED: There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

117
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,641
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

118
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,853
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer- if that's your thing -

119
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,523
a bottle of brandy
to celebrate your kid's high-school graduation.

120
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,942
Damn near anything, within reason.

121
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,320
Yes, sir. I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

122
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,488
(Siren wails)

123
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,036
So, when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949

124
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,456
and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth
into the prison for him,

125
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,583
I told him, "No problem."

126
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,002
Andy came to Shawshank Prison

127
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:51,215
in early 1947, for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

128
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,594
On the outside he had been vice-president
of a large Portland bank.

129
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,680

You follow this officer.

137
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:01,785
I haven't seen such a sorry-looking heap
of m-m-maggot shit in all my life.

138
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,912
MAN: Hey, fish! Come over here.

139
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,847

- Come on, fish.

140
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,271
Taking bets today, Red?

141
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,357
Smokes or coins? Better's choice.

142
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,233
Smokes. Put me down for two.

143
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,361
All right. Who's your horse?

144
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,739

145
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,990
He'll be first.

146
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,284
- Bullshit. I'll take that action.
- Me too.

147
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,620
You're out some smokes, son. Let me tell you.

148
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,622
Heywood, you're so smart, you call it.

149
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,208
I'll take...t-t-the chubby fat-ass there.

150
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,669
The fifth one from the front.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

Fresh fish today! We're reeling them in!

153
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:04,139
RED: I must admit, I didn't think much of Andy,
first time I laid eyes on him.

154
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,726
Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.

155
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,104
That was my first impression of the man.

156
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,897
MAN: What do you say, Red?

157
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,234
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

158
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,486
That guy? Never happen.

159
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,695
Ten cigarettes.

160
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,947
That's a rich bet.

161
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,241
All right. Who's gonna prove me wrong?

162
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,410
Heywood? Jigger?

163
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,953
Skeet?

164
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,247
Floyd?

165
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,457
Four brave souls.

166
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,377
TANNOY:

167
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,921

171
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,424
You are convicted felons.

172
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,843
That's why they've sent you to me.

The other rules...

177
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,395
you'll figure out as you go along.

178
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,272
Any questions?

179
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,523
When do we eat?

180
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,242
HADLEY: You eat when we say you eat!

181
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,704
You shit when we say you shit,
and you piss when we say you piss.

182
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,665
You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?

183
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,042
Aarghh!

184
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,085
On your feet.

185
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,962
NORTON: I believe in two things.

186
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,924
Discipline and the Bible.

187
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,842
Here you'll receive both.

188
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,596
Put your trust in the Lord.

189
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,515
Your ass belongs to me.

190
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,685
Welcome to Shawshank.

191
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,234
Unhook 'em.

192
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,366
Turn around.

193
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,166
That's enough.

194
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,002
Move to the end of the cage.

195
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,462
Turn around.

196
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,755
Delouse him.

197
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,841
Turn around.

198
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,639
Move out of the cage, go left.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

199
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,224
Next man up.

200
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,563
To the right. Right, right, right.

201
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,189
Left, left...

202
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:03,443
RED: The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

203
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,655
They march you in,
naked as the day you were born,

204
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,826
skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit they throw on you.

205
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,870
And when they put you in that cell,

206
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,623
and those bars slam home...

207
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,459
that's when you know it's for real.

208
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,879
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

209
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,172
Nothing left,

210
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,925
but all the time in the world to think about it.

211
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:31,972
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

212
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,350
Somebody always breaks down crying.

213
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,894
Happens every time.

214
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,063
The only question is:

215
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,523
Who's it gonna be?

216
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,193
It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.

217
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,197
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

218
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,500
Lights out!

219
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,211
(Click of light switches)

220
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:24,107
RED: I remember my first night.

221
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,234
Seems like a long time ago.

222
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,280
MAN: Yoo-hoo!

223
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,866
Hey, fish.

224
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,994
Fish, fish, fish, fish, fishy.

225
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,998
- Boy, are you scared of the dark?
- You like it here, new fish?

226
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,417
You'll wish
your daddy never dicked your mommy.

227
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:46,505
Fishy! Oh, I want me a pork chop. Oh, yes!

228
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:51,635
You taking this down, new fish?
There's gonna be a quiz later!

229
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,097
- Poke your ass out, give me a first look!
- Shh! Keep it down.

230
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,517
RED: The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

231
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,644
They don't quit till they reel someone in.

232
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,230
(Men whispering in background)

233
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,816
Hey, Fat Ass.

234
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,526
Fat Ass.

235
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,238
Talk to me, boy.

236
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,032
I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.

237
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:17,035
Don't you listen to these nitwits.
You hear me?

238
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,204
This place ain't so bad.

239
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,914
I tell you what.

240
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,252
I'll introduce you around.
Make you feel right at home.

241
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,921
I know a couple of big old bull queers

242
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,966
that would just love to make your acquaintance.

243
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,469
Especially that big, white,
m-mushy butt of yours.

244
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,471
God!

245
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,056
I don't belong here!

246
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,558
MAN: We have a winner!

247
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,393
FAT ASS: I wanna go home!

248
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,311
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

249
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,565
Hey, it's the fat guy! It's the fat guy!

250
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:50,485
Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

251
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,280
FAT ASS: I don't belong here!

252
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,573
ALL: Fresh fish!

253
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,993
I wanna go home. I want my mommy.

254
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,079
MAN: I had your mother. She wasn't that great.

255
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:02,664
(Men chanting) Fresh fish!

256
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,416
(Door opens)

257
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,294
What the Christ is this happy horse shit?

258
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,088
He took the Lord's name in vain.
I'm telling the Warden.

259
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,673
With my baton up your ass!

260
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,425
FAT ASS: Let me out of here!

261
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,887
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

262
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,138
FAT ASS: Please...

263
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,265
I ain't supposed to be here.

264
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,725
Not me!

265
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,269
I ain't gonna count to three, or even one.

266
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,646
Shut the fuck up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!

267
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,565
(Whispers) Shut up, man. Shut up.

268
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,941
There's been a mistake!

269
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:33,195
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here!

270
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,362
Open that cell.

271
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:38,575
MAN: Me neither.
You people run this place like a fucking prison!

272
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,126
HADLEY: Son of a bitch.

273
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,086
(Thuds)

274
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,214
(Whimpering)

275
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,341
PRISONER: Take it easy.

276
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,348
(Yelps)

277
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,534
If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here
the rest of the night,

278
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:24,287
I swear by God and sonny Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

279
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,414
Every last motherfucker in here.

280
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:34,005
Call the trustees.
Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.

281
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:53,066
RED: His first night in the joint,
Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

282
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,986
He never made a sound.

283
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,949
(Gate buzzer)

284
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,796
GUARD: Tier 3 North. Clear.

285
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,048
Tier 2 South. Clear.

286
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,009
Tier 3 South. Clear.

287
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,052
Tier 1 North...

288
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,930
- Tier 1 South. Clear.
- Tier 4 South. Clear.

289
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,057
Prepare to roll out.

290
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,521
GUARD: Roll out!

291
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,243
Are... Are you going to eat that?

292
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,205
I hadn't... I hadn't planned on it.

293
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,499
Do you mind?

294
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,467
Ah...that's nice and ripe.

295
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,307
(Chirps)

296
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:56,564
Jake says thank you.

297
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,025
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

298
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,865
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

299
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,701
Oh, no, no. Here he comes.

300
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:14,791
Morning, fellas. Fine morning, ain't it?

301
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,293
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?

302
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,796
Come on. Set 'em down.
I want 'em all lined up here,

303
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,674
just like a pretty little chorus line.

304
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,843
Yeah, look at that!

305
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,804
- Look at that. Oh, Lord!
- I can't stand this guy.

306
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,930
(Inhales)

307
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:31,683
Yes. Richmond, Virginia.

308
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,852
- Smell my ass!
- After he smells mine.

309
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:39,274
Gee, Red, it was a terrible shame
about your horse coming in last, an' all.

310
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,569
But I sure do love that winning horse of mine,
though.

311
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,363
I owe that boy a great big, sloppy kiss
when I see him.

312
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,450
Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes,
instead?

313
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,326
Lucky fuck.

314
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,120
Hey, Tyrell.

315
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,165
You pull infirmary duty this week?

316
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,958
How's that horse of mine doing?

317
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,501
Dead.

318
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:03,923
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.
The doc had already gone home for the night.

319
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,718
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

320
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,596
By then, hell, there weren't nothing we could do.

321
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:16,978
What was his name?

322
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,608
What did you say?

323
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,904
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.

324
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,656
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

325
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,495
It doesn't fuckin' matter what his name was.
He's dead.

326
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,225
Hey...

327
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:58,019
Anybody come at you yet?

328
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,523
Anybody get to you yet?

329
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,735
Hey, we all need friends in here.

330
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,695
I could be a friend to you.

331
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,825
Hey...

332
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,540
Hard to get.

333
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,876
I like that.

334
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:31,845
RED: Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.

335
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,389
I guess he had a lot on his mind,

336
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,641
trying to adapt to life on the inside.

337
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,937
It wasn't until a month went by
that he opened his mouth

338
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,273
to say more than two words to somebody.

339
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,277
As it turned out...

340
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,237
that somebody was me.

341
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:56,995
TANNOY: Officers Russell and Burwell
report to the duty officer.

342
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,832
I'm Andy Dufresne.

343
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,959
The wife-killing banker.

344
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,546
Why did you do it?

345
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,256
I didn't, since you ask.

346
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,384
(Laughs) You're gonna fit right in!

347
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,637
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

348
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:18,016
- Heywood, what are you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

349
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,771
Rumour has it you're a real cold fish.

350
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:27,609
You think your shit smells sweeter than most.
Is that right?

351
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,028
- What do you think?
- To tell you the truth,

352
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,198
I haven't made up my mind. (Chuckles)

353
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:37,368
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

354
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:40,955
I'm known to locate certain things,
from time to time.

355
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,042
- I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.
- A what?

356
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,501
A rock hammer.

357
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,837
- What is it, and why?
- What do you care?

358
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,634
Well, if it was a toothbrush, I'd just quote a price,

359
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:55,261
but then a toothbrush is a non-lethal object.

360
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,431
Fair enough.

361
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,975
A rock hammer
is about six or seven inches long.

362
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,685
Looks like a miniature pickaxe.

363
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,895
Pickaxe?

364
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,022
- For rocks.
- Rocks.

365
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,901
Quartz?

366
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,611
Quartz.

367
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,281
And some mica.

368
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:16,491
Shale.

369
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,202
Limestone.

370
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,204
So?

371
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,373
So, I'm a rock hound.

372
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:26,668
At least, I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again on a limited basis.

373
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,878
Or maybe you want
to hammer somebody's skull.

374
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:30,421
No, sir.

375
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,132
I have no enemies here.

376
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,551
No? Wait a while.

377
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,305
Word gets around.

378
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,517
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

379
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,352
Especially Bogs.

380
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:49,691
I don't suppose it would help any
if I explained to them I'm not homosexual.

381
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,276
RED: Neither are they.

382
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,028
You have to be human first. They don't qualify.

383
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:03,871
Bull queers take by force.
It's all they want or understand.

384
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:07,583
If I were you,
I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.

385
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,002
Thanks for the advice.

386
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,670
Well, that's free.

387
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,006
You understand my concern.

388
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,633
Well, if there's any trouble,
I won't use the hammer.

389
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:19,887
Then I guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

390
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,182
Did I miss something? What's funny?

391
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:26,269
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

392
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,189
What's an item like this usually go for?

393
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:33,318
Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

394
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:36,070
My normal mark-up's 20 per cent.

395
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,656
But this is a specialty item.

396
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:41,284
The risk goes up, the price goes up.

397
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,286
Let's make it an even ten bucks.

398
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,204
Ten it is.

399
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:48,750
Waste of money, if you ask me.

400
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,335
Why's that?

401
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:54,464
Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.

402
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,384
If they find it, you're gonna lose it.

403
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,595
If they do catch you with it, you don't know me.

404
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,889
Mention my name, we never do business again.

405
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:06,059
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now, you got that?

406
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:09,020
I understand.

407
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,480
Thank you...

408
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,148
Mr er...?

409
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,650
Red. The name's Red.

410
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:15,735
Red?

411
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,529
Why do they call you that?

412
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,285
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

413
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,338
RED: I could see
why some of the boys took him for snobby.

414
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,841
He had a quiet way about him.

415
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:43,388
A walk and a talk
that just wasn't normal around here.

416
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,014
He strolled...

417
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:49,435
like a man in a park,
without a care or worry in the world.

418
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,232
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

419
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:58,444
Yeah. I think it would be fair to say...

420
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,571
I liked Andy from the start.

421
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,493
Let's go!
Some of us have got a schedule to keep.

422
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:10,873
Move it! Come on. Move it!

423
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,630
Bob, how are you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

424
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:28,850
Easy.

425
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,977
Keep it moving.

426
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,022
Red...

427
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:59,797
RED: Andy was right. I finally got the joke.

428
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:04,343
It would take a man about 600 years
to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

429
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:09,849
Book?

430
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,767
Not today.

431
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,192
- Book?
- No.

432
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:22,195
Hey, Brooksy.

433
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,575
Delivery for Dufresne.

434
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:40,296
Book?

435
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,468
Dufresne...

436
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,678
Here's your book.

437
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,768
Thanks.

438
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:00,858
Dufresne! We're running low on Hexlite.

439
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:02,985
Get on back and fetch us up some.

440
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,191
If you get this in your eyes, it blinds you.

441
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,986
Honey...hush.

442
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,953
(Groans)

443
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,500
That's it. You fight.

444
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,168
It's better that way.

445
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,004
(Screaming and yelling)

446
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,430
RED: I wish I could tell you
that Andy fought the good fight,

447
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:15,057
and the Sisters let him be.

448
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,143
I wish I could tell you that.

449
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,270
But prison is no fairy-tale world.

450
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,399
He never said who did it.

451
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,527
But we all knew.

452
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,446
(Gate buzzer)

453
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,742
Things went on like that for a while.

454
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,453
Prison life consists of routine...

455
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:37,705
and then more routine.

456
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,919
Every so often,
Andy would show up with fresh bruises.

457
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,173
The Sisters kept at him.

458
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:51,385
Sometimes he was able to fight 'em off.
Sometimes not.

459
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,722
And that's how it went for Andy.

460
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,350
That was his routine.

461
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:01,228
I do believe
those first two years were the worst for him.

462
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,564
And I also believe,

463
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:08,194
if things had gone on that way,
this place would have got the best of him.

464
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:11,238
But then, in the spring of 1949,

465
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,324
the powers that be decided that...

466
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,827
The roof of the licence-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

467
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,622
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.

468
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,958
As you know,

469
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:26,754
special detail carries with it special privileges.

470
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,881
RED: It was outdoor detail...

471
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:34,011
..and May is one damn fine month
to be working outdoors.

472
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:35,721
Stay in line there.

473
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:38,683
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

474
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:41,852
(Whispers)

475
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,356
Wallace E Unger.

476
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,026
Ellis Redding.

477
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:51,946
Wouldn't you know it?

478
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,615
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names.

479
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,784
GUARD: Andrew Dufresne.

480
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,413
RED: It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

481
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:03,207
I made my usual 20 per cent, of course.

482
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,877
HADLEY: So, this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

483
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,671
I say, "Yeah?"

484
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:12,466
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

485
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,052
Oh, damn, Byron. I'm sorry to hear that.

486
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:16,512
I'm not. He was an asshole.

487
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,931
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead, anyway.

488
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,977
So, anyway, this lawyer fella says to me,
"Your brother died a rich man."

489
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,771
Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.

490
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,315
GUARD: A million bucks?

491
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,776
Fucking incredible
how lucky some assholes get.

492
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:33,404
Jeez-Louise! Are you gonna see any of that?

493
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,574
35,000. That's what he left me.

494
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,576
- Dollars?
- Yeah.

495
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,787
Holy shit! That's great.
That's like winning the sweepstakes.

496
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,080
Isn't it?

497
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:46,208
Dumb shit. What do you think
the government's gonna do to me?

498
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,794
Take a big, wet bite out of my ass, is what.

499
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:53,007
Poor Byron! Terrible fucking luck, huh?

500
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,760
RED: Crying shame.

501
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,511
Some people really got it awful!

502
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,138
Andy, are you nuts?

503
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,307
Keep your eyes on your mop, man. Andy!

504
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:04,393
GUARD: Well, you'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up...

505
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:07,313
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Maybe enough to buy a new car. Then what?

506
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,774
I've got to pay tax on the car.

507
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:13,736
Repair, maintenance, goddamn kids
pestering me to take them for a ride...

508
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,740
And at the end of the year, you figure the tax
wrong, you pay them out of your own pocket.

509
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,992
I tell you...Uncle Sam!

510
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,829
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

511
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:26,624
- Andy! Andy!
- What's he doing?

512
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,043
- Getting himself killed.
- Keep tarring.

513
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,213
Some brother! Shit. (Spits)

514
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,297
Hey!

515
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,844
Mr Hadley...

516
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,304
do you trust your wife?

517
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,641
Oh, that's funny.

518
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:46,560
You're gonna look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

519
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:50,105
I mean, do you think
she'd go behind your back, try to hamstring you?

520
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:53,108
That's it. Step aside, Mert.

521
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:54,693
This fucker's having an accident.

522
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:55,945
He's gonna push him off.

523
00:35:56,029 --> 00:36:00,157
Cos if you do trust her,
there's no reason you can't keep that 35,000.

524
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,117
- What did you say?
- 35,000.

525
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,869
- 35,000?
- All of it.

526
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:06,247
- All of it?
- Every penny.

527
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,165
You'd better start making sense.

528
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,584
If you want to keep the money,
give it to your wife.

529
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:14,797
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

530
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,382
Bullshit! Tax-free?

531
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:19,593
Tax-free. The IRS can't touch one cent.

532
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,263
You're the smart banker what killed his wife.

533
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:25,891
Why should I believe a smart banker like you?
So I can end up in here with you?

534
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:27,476
It's legal. Ask the IRS.

535
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:30,771
They'll say the same thing.
But I feel stupid telling you this.

536
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:33,148
I'm sure you would have investigated the matter.

537
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:37,319
Yeah, I don't need no banker to tell me
where the bears shit in the buckwheat.

538
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:40,447
Of course not, but you do need someone
to set up the tax-free gift.

539
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,408
It'll cost you. A lawyer.

540
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,827
A bunch of ball-washing bastards.

541
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,706
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

542
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,125
If you get the forms, I'll prepare them for you.

543
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,043
Nearly free of charge.

544
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,548
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my co-workers.

545
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,050
GUARD:
Co-workers! Get him! That's rich, ain't it?

546
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:03,596
I think a man working outdoors
feels more like a man

547
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,431
if he can have a bottle of suds.

548
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,517
That's only my opinion...sir.

549
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,522
What are you jimmies staring at?

550
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:14,607
Back to work!

551
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,609
GUARD: Let's go. Work.

552
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:30,497
RED: And that's how it came to pass...
that on the second-to-last day of the job,

553
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:35,294
the convict crew that tarred the plate-factory roof
in the spring of '49...

554
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,589
wound up sitting in a row
at ten o'clock in the morning,

555
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,551
drinking icy-cold, Bohemia-style beer...

556
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:47,848
courtesy of the hardest screw that ever
walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

557
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,975
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

558
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:55,522
The colossal prick
even managed to sound magnanimous.

559
00:37:57,317 --> 00:38:01,946
We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders,
and felt like free men.

560
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:05,532
Hell, we could have been tarring the roof
of one of our own houses.

561
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,911
We were the lords of all creation.

562
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:13,540
As for Andy,
he spent that break hunkered in the shade...

563
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,335
a strange little smile on his face,

564
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,462
watching us drink his beer.

565
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,804
Hey...

566
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,180
Want a cold one, Andy?

567
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,932
No, thanks.

568
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,767
I gave up drinking.

569
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,816
RED: You could argue
he'd done it to curry favour with the guards.

570
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,694
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

571
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:47,408
Me, I think he did it just to feel normal again.

572
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,577
If only for a short while.

573
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,833
RED: King me.

574
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,335
Chess. Now, there's a game of kings.

575
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,963
- What?
- Civilised, strategic.

576
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,382
And a total fucking mystery.

577
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,675
I hate it.

578
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,677
Maybe you'll let me teach you someday.

579
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,221
(Chuckles) Yeah. Sure.

580
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,432
I thought of getting a board together.

581
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:14,309
Well, I'm the right man.
I'm the guy that can get things.

582
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,894
We might do business on a board.

583
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,772
But I want to carve the pieces myself.

584
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:22,443
One side in alabaster, the opposing side
in soapstone. What do you think?

585
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,445
I think it'll take years.

586
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,114
Well, years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

587
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,366
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

588
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:31,368
Pebbles, mostly.

589
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:38,625
Andy, we're getting to be kinda friends,
aren't we?

590
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,335
Yeah, I guess.

591
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,922
Can I ask you something?

592
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,008
Why did you do it?

593
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:51,055
I'm innocent, Red. Just like everybody else here.

594
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,436
What are you in for?

595
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:00,481
Murder.

596
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,982
Same as you.

597
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,192
Innocent?

598
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,946
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

599
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,049
Where's the canary?

600
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,425
How did you know?

601
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,635
How did I know what?

602
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,096
So, you don't know? Come.

603
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,017
This is where the canary is, Johnny.

604
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:21,311
(Woman singing)

605
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:25,357
Quite a surprise to hear a woman singing
in my house, eh, Johnny?

606
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,696
That's quite a...

607
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,406
surprise.

608
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,660
Red...

609
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,537
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

610
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,455
Here she comes.

611
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,417
This is the part I like -
when she does that shit with her hair.

612
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,420
Yeah, I know. I've seen it three times this month.

613
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,505
Gilda, are you decent?

614
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,632
Me?

615
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,259
(Men howl)

616
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,386
Hah! God, I love it!

617
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,513
(Men cheer and whistle)

618
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:04,062
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

619
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:08,025
Yeah, I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

620
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,611
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

621
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,487
Can you get her?

622
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:17,075
So, this is Johnny Farrell.
I've heard a lot about you, Johnny.

623
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,036
Take a few weeks.

624
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,245
Weeks?

625
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:25,584
Well, yeah, Andy. I don't have her stuffed down
the front of my pants right now, I'm sorry to say.

626
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,128
But I'll get her. Relax.

627
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:31,924
Thanks.

628
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,009
- It was a surprise, Mr Farrell.
- It was.

629
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,135
MEN: Sit down.

630
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,137
Did you tell him what I'm doing here?

631
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:40,057
No, I wanted to save that as a surprise, too.

632
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:41,767
Hang on to your hat, Mr Farrell...

633
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:47,022
(Grunts)

634
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,154
- Take a walk.
- I gotta change the reel.

635
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,281
I said fuck off!

636
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:01,078
(Door closes as film dialogue continues)

637
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,914
Ain't you gonna scream?

638
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,084
Let's get this over with.

639
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:12,839
He broke my fuckin' nose!

640
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:27,437
Now...I'm gonna open my fly...

641
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:30,440
and you're gonna swallow
what I give you to swallow.

642
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,360
Then you're gonna swallow Rooster's.

643
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,280
You broke his nose,
he ought to have something to show for it.

644
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,573
Anything you put in my mouth,
you're gonna lose.

645
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:41,410
No. You don't understand.

646
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:44,746
You do that, and I'll put
all eight inches of this steel in your ear.

647
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:45,831
All right.

648
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:50,544
But you should know that sudden, serious
brain injury causes the victim to bite down hard.

649
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:54,256
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong,

650
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:59,094
they have to pry the victim's jaws open...
with a crowbar.

651
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,598
Where did you get this shit?

652
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:05,309
I read it.

653
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:09,271
Know how to read, you ignorant fuck?

654
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,649
Honey...

655
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,320
..you shouldn't.

656
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,280
(Groans)

657
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:21,366
RED: Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth...

658
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:23,827
and neither did his friends.

659
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,164
What they did do...
is beat him within an inch of his life.

660
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,375
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

661
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:33,920
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

662
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,010
Time's up, Bogs.

663
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:45,766
It's your world, boss.

664
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:51,313
TANNOY:
Return to your cell blocks for evening count.

665
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,523
All prisoners report for lockdown.

666
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,374
What?

667
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,795
(Gasps)

668
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:19,091
(Bogs cries in pain)

669
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,555
GUARD: Where's he going?
HADLEY: Grab his ankles.

670
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,684
No! No!

671
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:31,144
No!

672
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,562
Help me...

673
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:33,939
Aaarghh!

674
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:36,149
(Punching and screaming)

675
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,902
RED:
Two things never happened again after that.

676
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,780
The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again...

677
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:45,742
..and Bogs never walked again.

678
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:50,288
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

679
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:56,086
To my knowledge, he lived out the rest
of his days drinking his food through a straw.

680
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:00,799
I'm thinking Andy could use a nice welcome
back when he gets out of the infirmary.

681
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:05,720
Sounds good to us.
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

682
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,808
The man likes to play chess.

683
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,935
Let's get him some rocks.

684
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,261
Guys...

685
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,680
I got one. I got one. Look.

686
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,226
Heywood, that isn't soapstone.

687
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:55,520
And it ain't alabaster, either.

688
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:57,230
What are you, a fucking geologist?

689
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,357
He's right. It ain't.

690
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:00,692
Well, what the hell is it?

691
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,320
RED: A horse apple.

692
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:06,531
- Bullshit.
- No, horse shit. Petrified.

693
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:08,658
(Horse whinnies)

694
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:15,790
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
(Men laugh)

695
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,834
Oh, damn!

696
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:21,838
RED: Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

697
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,717
And by the weekend he was due back,
we had enough rocks

698
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,845
to keep him busy till rapture.

699
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,640
I also got a big shipment in that week.

700
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:34,267
Cigarettes. Chewing gum.

701
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,852
Sipping whisky.

702
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:39,481
Playing cards with naked ladies on them.
You name it.

703
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,484
And of course, the most important item.

704
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,321
Rita Hayworth herself.

705
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:23,358
GUARD: OK, look alive! Open all tiers.

706
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,777
(Furtively) Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

707
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,071
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

708
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,075
119.

709
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,245
123.

710
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:38,415
(Guards calling out)

711
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,590
On your feet.

712
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,176
Face the wall.

713
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,755
HADLEY: Turn around and face the Warden.

714
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,554
Pleased to see you reading this.

715
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,224
Any favourite passages?

716
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:44,397
"Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not
when the master of the house cometh."

717
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:48,360
Mark 13:35.

718
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:51,112
I always liked that one.

719
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,697
But I prefer...

720
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:55,492
"I'm the light of the world.

721
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:59,162
He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,
but shall have the light of life."

722
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,831
John, Chapter 8, Verse 12.

723
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:05,335
I hear you're good with numbers. How nice.

724
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:08,546
A man should have a skill.

725
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,092
Wanna explain this?

726
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:16,638
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

727
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,641
A little hobby of mine.

728
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:30,443
(Inhales)

729
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:33,530
It's pretty clean. Some contraband here,

730
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,657
but nothing to get in a twist over.

731
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,579
I can't say I approve of this.

732
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:44,791
But I suppose...

733
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,628
..exceptions can be made.

734
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,307
HADLEY: Lock 'em up!

735
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:05,311
I almost forgot.

736
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:07,647
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

737
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,149
Salvation lies within.

738
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,568
Yes, sir.

739
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,454
RED: Tossing cells was just an excuse.

740
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,583
The truth is, Norton wanted to size Andy up.

741
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:43,391
My wife made that in church group.

742
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:47,020
Very nice, sir.

743
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,064
Do you enjoy working in the laundry?

744
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:53,443
No, sir, not especially.

745
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,321
Perhaps we can find something more...

746
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:58,448
befitting a man of your education.

747
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,662
(Bird screeches)

748
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:08,500
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

749
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:09,876
Andy.

750
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,212
I thought I heard you out here!

751
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,340
I've been reassigned to you.

752
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:18,593
I know. They told me. (Chuckles)

753
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,762
Ain't that a kick in the head?

754
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,348
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

755
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:25,517
Come on.

756
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:27,769
Well, here she is.

757
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,396
Shawshank Prison library.

758
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:33,358
National Geographic.

759
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:36,277
Reader's Digest condensed books.

760
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,613
Louis L'Amour.

761
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,782
Look Magazine.

762
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,368
Erle Stanley Gardners.

763
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:46,955
Every evening,
I load up the cart and make my round.

764
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:50,166
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

765
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:53,711
Easy-peasy, Japanesey. Any questions?

766
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:56,756
Brooks, how long have you been librarian?

767
00:52:56,841 --> 00:53:02,011
Oh...I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

768
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:05,473
And in all that time,
have you ever had an assistant?

769
00:53:05,558 --> 00:53:08,142
No. No, not much to it, really.

770
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:10,144
Well, why me? Why now?

771
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,729
I don't know,

772
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:15,108
but it'll be nice to have some company
down here for a change.

773
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,193
HADLEY: Dufresne!

774
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,580
That's him. That's the one.

775
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,463
I'm Dekins.

776
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,966
(Nervously) I was er...

777
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:44,053
thinking about maybe setting up
some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

778
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:47,891
Oh...

779
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,601
I see.

780
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:52,937
Well, erm...

781
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,899
..why don't we have a seat,

782
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,026
and talk it over?

783
00:54:00,613 --> 00:54:03,489
Brooks,
do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?

784
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:16,711
Thanks.

785
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,421
So...

786
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:22,216
Mr Dekins...

787
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:26,763
And then Andy says to Mr Dekins,
"Do you want your sons to go to Harvard,

788
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,973
- or Yale?"
- He didn't say that?

789
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:31,726
As God is my witness, he did!

790
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,188
Dekins just blinked for a second.
Then he laughed himself silly.

791
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,148
And afterwards he shook Andy's hand.

792
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,608
My ass!

793
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:39,901
Shook his hand.

794
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,946
Hell, I...I near soiled myself! (Laughs)

795
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:47,241
All Andy needed was a suit and a tie
and a little jiggly hula girl on his desk,

796
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:48,660
and he would have been:

797
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,286
"Mr Dufresne, if you please"!

798
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:52,080
Making a few friends, Andy?

799
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,124
I wouldn't say "friends".

800
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:59,212
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

801
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,631
It's a wonderful pet to have.

802
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,633
Got you out of the laundry, though.

803
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,927
Well, it might do more than that.

804
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:09,013
How about expanding the library?
Get some new books in there.

805
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:11,808
If you're gonna ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

806
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:14,352
- Right.
- How do you expect to do that?

807
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:19,691
I mean, get new books in here,
Mr Dufresne, if you please?

808
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,526
Ask the Warden for funds.

809
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:22,860
(Laughter)

810
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:26,239
Son, son. Six wardens
have been through here in my tenure,

811
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:29,951
and I've learned one immutable, universal truth.

812
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,703
Not one of them born...

813
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:36,708
whose asshole wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you asked them for funds.

814
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:39,085
The budget's stretched thin, as it is.

815
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,420
I see.

816
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:44,007
Perhaps I could write to the State Senate
and request funds from them.

817
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:48,511
As far as they're concerned, there's only three
ways to spend money when it comes to prisons:

818
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,680
more walls, more bars and more guards.

819
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:55,184
Still, I'd like to try, with your permission.
A letter a week. They can't ignore me for ever.

820
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:56,811
Sure can.

821
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,772
But you write your letters, if it makes you happy.

822
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:02,108
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

823
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:07,113
RED: So, Andy started writing a letter a week,

824
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,282
just like he said.

825
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:17,415
And, just like Norton said, Andy got no answers.

826
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:30,803
The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

827
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:33,973
The year after that, he did them all...

828
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:36,100
including the Warden's.

829
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:41,272
The year after that, they rescheduled
the start of the intramural season

830
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,399
to coincide with tax season.

831
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:49,947
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

832
00:56:50,032 --> 00:56:54,160
So, Moresby Prison issued you your gun,
but you had to pay for it?

833
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,995
Damn right. The holster, too.

834
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,330
That's tax-deductible.

835
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,581
You can write that off.

836
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:02,001
RED: Yes, sir.
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

837
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:05,129
In fact, it got so busy at tax time...

838
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:07,256
he was allowed a staff.

839
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,801
Hey, Red, can you hand me a stack of 1040s?

840
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:12,553
It got me out of the wood shop
a month out of the year,

841
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:15,306
and that was fine by me.

842
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,726
And still...he kept sending those letters.

843
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,900
Red, Andy.

844
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,193
It's Brooks.

845
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,737
(Men shouting)
- Watch the door.

846
00:57:29,822 --> 00:57:31,405
Please, Brooks.

847
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:33,491
- Just calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

848
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,618
- Stay back!
- What the hell's going on?

849
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,788
You tell me. One second he's fine.
Then out comes the knife.

850
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:41,332
Brooks, we can talk about this. Right?

851
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,543
Nothing to talk about, goddamn it!

852
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,336
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.

853
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,296
Heywood? Wait, what's he done to you?

854
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:49,507
It's what they done!

855
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,008
I...I got no choice...

856
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:53,761
You're not gonna hurt him.
Even Heywood knows that.

857
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:56,472
- Right, Heywood?
- I...I know that, sure.

858
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:59,976
You won't hurt him, because he's a friend,
and you're a reasonable man.

859
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,352
That's right. Right, guys?

860
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,814
- Yes.
- So, put the knife down. Brooks, look at me.

861
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,691
Put the knife down.

862
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:08,985
Brooks...

863
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:11,320
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

864
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:13,739
Brooks, look at his neck. It's bleeding.

865
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:14,991
(Heywood gasps)

866
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,659
It's the only...

867
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,036
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

868
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:21,664
Come on. This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

869
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,791
Put it down.

870
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:27,461
(Brooks sobs)

871
00:58:31,175 --> 00:58:35,887
Come on. Take it easy.
You're going to be all right.

872
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:37,346
HEYWOOD: Him?

873
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:41,100
Hell, what about me?
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat.

874
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:43,811
RED: Shit, Heywood,
you've had worse from shaving.

875
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:46,147
What the hell did you do to set him off, anyway?

876
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,566
Nothing. I come in here to say fare-thee-well.

877
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,736
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

878
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:56,949
I just don't understand what happened in there.
That's all.

879
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:59,619
The old man's as crazy
as a rat in a tin shithouse.

880
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,913
Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you.

881
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:04,999
- I heard he had you shitting in your pants.
- Fuck you!

882
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,459
Would you knock it off?

883
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:08,878
Brooks ain't no bug.

884
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,796
He's just...

885
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,508
He's just institutionalised.

886
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:17,553
Institutionalised, my ass.

887
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:21,933
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood.
50 years.

888
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:23,726
This is all he knows.

889
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,229
In here, he's an important man.

890
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:27,772
He's an educated man.

891
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:29,899
Outside, he's nothing.

892
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,737
Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.

893
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:38,032
Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.

894
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,201
You know what I'm trying to say?

895
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:43,037
Red, I do believe you're talking out of your ass.

896
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:47,166
You believe whatever you want, Floyd.

897
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:49,710
But I'm telling you, these walls are funny.

898
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:53,214
First you hate 'em...

899
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,842
..then you get used to 'em.

900
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:01,138
Enough time passes...

901
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:04,183
you get so you depend on 'em.

902
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:06,602
That's institutionalised.

903
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:08,020
JIGGER: Shit.

904
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:09,689
You can never get like that.

905
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:11,691
Oh, yeah?

906
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:14,360
Say that when you've been here
as long as Brooks has.

907
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,279
Goddamn right.

908
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:21,200
They send you here for life.

909
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:23,327
That's exactly what they take.

910
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:27,331
The part that counts, anyway.

911
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,629
(Jake screeches)

912
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,924
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

913
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,678
You go on, now.

914
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:46,434
You're free.

915
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,201
Bye.

916
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,204
Good luck, Brooks.

917
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:46,535
BROOKS: Dear fellas...

918
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:50,831
I can't believe
how fast things move on the outside.

919
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,166
(Horn blares)

920
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,294
Watch it, old-timer! Are you trying to get killed?

921
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:58,714
I saw an automobile once, when I was a kid,

922
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:01,675
but now...they're everywhere.

923
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:09,475
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

924
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:32,164
The parole board got me into
this halfway house called The Brewer,

925
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:36,043
and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway.

926
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:43,426
It's hard work, and I try to keep up,
but my hands hurt most of the time.

927
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,511
WOMAN: Make sure your man double-bags.

928
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,847
Last time, the bottom near came out.

929
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:51,225
Make sure you double-bag, like the lady says.
Understand?

930
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,768
Yes, sir. I surely will.

931
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:56,647
BROOKS: I don't think
the store manager likes me very much.

932
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,482
(Pigeons cooing)

933
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:04,405
Sometimes, after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

934
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:09,827
I keep thinking Jake might just show up
and say hello.

935
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:11,662
But he never does.

936
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:18,127
And I hope, wherever he is,
he's doing OK and making new friends.

937
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:24,592
I have trouble sleeping at night.

938
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:27,428
I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.

939
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:30,473
I wake up, scared.

940
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:34,518
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

941
01:03:36,188 --> 01:03:37,646
Maybe I should get me a gun

942
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:41,609
and rob the Foodway, so they'd send me home.

943
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:44,028
I could shoot the manager, while I was at it.

944
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:46,030
Sort of like a bonus.

945
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:51,827
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense
any more.

946
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:53,954
I don't like it here.

947
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:56,707
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.

948
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:57,875
I've decided...

949
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,793
not to stay.

950
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:14,683
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.

951
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:16,810
Not for an old crook like me.

952
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,577
(Scraping)

953
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:23,919
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.
Not for an old crook like me.

954
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:29,091
PS. Tell Heywood
I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.

955
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,218
No hard feelings. Brooks."

956
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,981
He should have died in here.

957
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:53,866
HADLEY: What the fuck have you done?
It's a goddamn mess. I'll tell you that.

958
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:00,039
What's all this?

959
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:04,001
You tell me, fuck-stick.
They're all addressed to you.

960
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,336
Take it.

961
01:06:14,346 --> 01:06:15,888
"Dear Mr Dufresne...

962
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:19,016
In response to your repeated enquiries,

963
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:23,812
the State has allocated the enclosed funds
for your library project."

964
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,230
This is 200 dollars.

965
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:30,235
"In addition, the Library District
has generously responded

966
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,030
with a charitable donation
of used books and sundries.

967
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:35,199
We trust this will fill your needs.

968
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:39,411
We now consider the matter closed.
Please stop sending us letters."

969
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:42,331
I want all this cleared out
before the Warden gets back.

970
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:44,041
Yes, sir.

971
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,171
Good for you, Andy.

972
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,258
Wow!

973
01:06:54,386 --> 01:06:56,428
It only took six years.

974
01:06:57,806 --> 01:07:00,641
From now on,
I'll write two letters a week, instead of one.

975
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:04,269
Oh, I believe you're crazy enough.
You'd better get all this stuff out,

976
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:05,521
like the Captain said.

977
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:09,441
Now, I'm gonna go pinch a loaf.
When I come back, this is all gone, right?

978
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:17,616

The truth is, I don't want to know.

higher and farther
than anybody in a grey place dares to dream.

flapped into our drab little cage

Easiest time I ever did.

01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:22,569
Bullshit!
There's no such thing as easy time in the hole.

And in here.

That's the beauty of music.
They can't get that from you.

Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

1034
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:54,601
Well, I played a mean harmonica,
as a younger man.

1035
01:11:54,686 --> 01:11:56,478
Lost interest in it, though.

1036
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,397
Didn't make much sense in here.

1037
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,941
Here's where it makes the most sense.

1038

You need it, so you don't forget.

1039

..in the world that aren't made out of stone...

1043
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:15,247
that there's a...

1044
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,165
there's something...

1045
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:20,043
inside that they can't get to...

1046
01:12:20,128 --> 01:12:22,421
that they can't touch.

1047
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:24,339
It's yours.

1048
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,467
What are you talking about?

1049
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,178
Hope.

1050
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,097
Hope?

1051
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:36,643
Let me tell you something, my friend.

1052
01:12:36,728 --> 01:12:38,645
Hope is a dangerous thing.

1053
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:42,274
Hope can drive a man insane.

1054
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,277
It's got no use on the inside.

1055
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,988
You'd better get used to that idea.

1056
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:52,034
Like Brooks did?

1057
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,351
Sit down.

1058
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:27,027
It says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

1059
01:13:27,111 --> 01:13:29,738
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1060
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:31,865
Oh, yes, sir.

1061
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,992
Without a doubt.

1062
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:37,329
And I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

1063
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:42,000
No danger to society here.

1064
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:44,127
God's honest truth.

1065
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:48,548
Absolutely rehabilitated.

1066
01:13:58,518 --> 01:14:00,560
30 years.

1067
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,730
Jesus, when they say it like that...

1068
01:14:03,815 --> 01:14:05,857
You wonder where it went.

1069
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,904
I wonder where ten years went.

1070
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:17,285
Here.

1071
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,496
Little parole rejection present.

1072
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,416
Go ahead and open it.

1073
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:27,295
I had to go through one of your competitors.
I hope you don't mind.

1074
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:29,422
I wanted it to be a surprise.

1075
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,643
It's very pretty, Andy.

1076
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,813
Thank you.

1077
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,650
Are you going to play it?

1078
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:54,865
No.

1079
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:59,244
Not right now.

1080
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,459
(Guards shout)

1081
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:08,587
Tier 3 South. Clear.

1082
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:11,715
Tier 4 North. Clear.

1083
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:13,842
Tier 1 South. Clear.

1084
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:18,763
Fall in!

1085
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,560
(Gate buzzer)

1086
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:53,298
(Guard's footsteps)

1087
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,966
Lights out!

1088
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:56,509
(Click of light switches)

1089
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,017
(Guard walks away)

1090
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:12,275
(Outer door closes)

1091
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,203
(Gently plays one note)

1092
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:29,793
(Hammering)

1093
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:31,920
RED: Andy was as good as his word.

1094
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:34,464
He wrote two letters a week instead of one.

1095
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:41,263
In 1959, the State Senate
finally clued into the fact

1096
01:16:41,347 --> 01:16:44,182
they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 cheque.

1097
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:50,897
Appropriations Committee voted
an annual payment of $500 just to shut him up.

1098
01:16:50,982 --> 01:16:52,691
And you'd be amazed

1099
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,442
how far Andy could stretch it.

1100
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:57,404
He made deals with book clubs, charity groups.

1101
01:16:57,488 --> 01:16:59,864
He bought remaindered books by the pound.

1102
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:02,158
Treasure Island.

1103
01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:04,411
Robert Louis...

1104
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:05,704
..Stevenson.

1105
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,205
Fiction, adventure.

1106
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:10,834
What's next?

1107
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:13,545
I got here Auto Repair and...

1108
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:15,964
..Soap Carving.

1109
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:19,426
Trade skills and hobbies. Goes under
Educational. The stack behind you.

1110
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:21,553
The Count Of Monte Crisco.

1111
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,972
That's Cristo, you dumb shit.

1112
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:27,851
By Alexandree...Dumass.

1113
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:32,814
Dumb-ass?

1114
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,694
Dumas. You know what that's about?

1115
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:39,154
Uh-uh.

1116
01:17:39,238 --> 01:17:41,948
You'll like it. It's about a prison break.

1117
01:17:42,033 --> 01:17:46,036
We ought to file that under Educational, too,
oughtn't we?

1118
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:50,248
RED: The rest of us did our best to pitch in
when and where we could.

1119
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:53,376
By the year Kennedy was shot,

1120
01:17:53,461 --> 01:17:57,756
Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of rat turds and turpentine

1121
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,134
into the best prison library in New England,

1122
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:05,096
complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.

1123
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:09,351
♪ Lawd I don't know what I'll do-ooo

1124
01:18:09,435 --> 01:18:12,187
♪ All I do is sit and sigh...

1125
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:17,025
RED: That was also the year Warden Norton
instituted his famous Inside Out programme.

1126
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:19,819
You may remember reading about it.

1127
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:23,323
It made all the papers
and got his picture in Look Magazine.

1128
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:25,075
No free ride.

1129
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:28,119
But rather a genuine, progressive advance

1130
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,330
in corrections and rehabilitation.

1131
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:33,750
Our inmates, properly supervised,

1132
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:36,586
will be put to work outside these walls,

1133
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,755
performing all manner of public service.

1134
01:18:38,839 --> 01:18:42,759
These men can learn
the value of an honest day's labour,

1135
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:46,513
while providing a valuable service
to the community and...

1136
01:18:46,597 --> 01:18:51,810
at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr and Mrs John Q Taxpayer.

1137
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:54,562
RED: Of course,
Norton failed to mention to the press

1138
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:57,941
that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

1139
01:18:58,025 --> 01:19:01,194
There are a hundred different ways
to skim off the top.

1140
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:03,863
Men, materials, you name it.

1141
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:07,700
And, oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in.

1142
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:09,911
If this keeps up, you'll put me out of business.

1143
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:12,163
- Ned!
- This pool of slave labour you've got,

1144
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:14,290
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1145
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:18,336
Ned, we're providing
a valuable community service here.

1146
01:19:18,421 --> 01:19:20,672
Well, that's fine for the papers

1147
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,257
but I've got a family to feed.

1148
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:24,050
Sam...

1149
01:19:24,135 --> 01:19:26,594
Sam, we go back a long way.

1150
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:29,013
I need this new highway contract.

1151
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:31,307
I don't get it, and I go under.

1152
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:33,435
That's a fact.

1153
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:35,603
You just have some of this fine pie

1154
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:37,730
my missus made especially for you,

1155
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:39,107
and you think about that.

1156
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,118
Ned, I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1157
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:53,371
It seems to me I already got
my boys committed elsewhere.

1158
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,834
You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.

1159
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:01,671
RED: And behind every shady deal,

1160
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:03,965
behind every dollar earned,

1161
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:07,177
there was Andy, keeping the books.

1162
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:11,681
Two deposits.
Maine National and New England First.

1163
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:13,808
Night drops as always, sir.

1164
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:46,007
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1165
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:48,885
- Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.
- Yes, sir.

1166
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:52,722
Tell them if they overstarch my shirts again,
they'll hear about it from me.

1167
01:20:52,806 --> 01:20:54,807
How do I look?

1168
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:57,602
- Very nice, sir.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1169
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,354
The Governor's going to be there.

1170
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:02,857
Want the rest of this?

1171
01:21:02,942 --> 01:21:04,984
The woman can't bake worth shit.

1172
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:08,154
Thank you, sir.

1173
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:14,118
- He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, I hear.
- What you hear isn't half of it.

1174
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:16,663
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of.

1175
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:18,790
Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1176
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:21,751
There's a river of dirty money
running through this place.

1177
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:25,088
But the problem with having all that money
is you'll have to explain

1178
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:27,757
- where it came from.
- That's where I come in.

1179
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:30,343
I channel it, filter it, funnel it.

1180
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:32,971
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

1181
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:35,723
I send that money out into the real world.

1182
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:39,435
- And when it comes back...
- Clean as a virgin's honey pot, huh?

1183
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,728
Cleaner.

1184
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:44,399
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1185
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:51,614
If they ever catch on, though, he's gonna
wind up in here wearing a number himself.

1186
01:21:51,699 --> 01:21:54,951
Now, Red, I thought you had
a little more faith in me than that.

1187
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:58,329
I know you're good, Andy,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1188
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:01,416
Now, anybody gets curious,
the FBI, the IRS, whatever,

1189
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,335
it's gonna lead to somebody.

1190
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,379
Sure it is. But not to me.

1191
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:08,423
And certainly not to the Warden.

1192
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:13,803
All right. Who?

1193
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,597
Randall Stevens.

1194
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:16,806
Who?

1195
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:22,645
The silent silent partner. He's the guilty one,
Your Honour. The man with the bank accounts.

1196
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:24,897
That's where the filtering process starts.

1197
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:28,151
If they trace anything,
it's just going to lead to him.

1198
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:29,819
But who is he?

1199
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:31,946
He's a phantom, an apparition.

1200
01:22:32,031 --> 01:22:33,990
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1201
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:36,242
I conjured him...

1202
01:22:36,327 --> 01:22:38,369
out of thin air.

1203
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:41,247
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1204
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:46,794
Andy, you can't just make a person up.

1205
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:50,006
Sure you can, if you know how
the system works, where the cracks are.

1206
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:53,593
It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.

1207
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:56,304
Mr Stevens has a birth certificate,

1208
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:58,723
a driver's licence, social security number.

1209
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,016
You're shitting me?

1210
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:02,060
If they ever trace any of those accounts,

1211
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:05,021
they're going to wind up chasing
a figment of my imagination.

1212
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:07,148
Well, I'll be damned.

1213
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:10,526
Did I say you were good?

1214
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:12,779
Shit, you're a Rembrandt!

1215
01:23:12,863 --> 01:23:14,906
You know, the funny thing is,

1216
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:18,951
on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1217
01:23:20,037 --> 01:23:22,330
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1218
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:32,465
Ever bother you?

1219
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:36,969
I don't run the scams, Red,
I just process the profits.

1220
01:23:37,054 --> 01:23:39,097
Fine line maybe but...

1221
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:41,891
I also built that library

1222
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:44,602
and used it to help a dozen guys
get a high school diploma.

1223
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:46,562
Why do you think the Warden lets me do it?

1224
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:49,399
To keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1225
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:51,609
Money instead of sheets.

1226
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:54,404
Well, I work cheap. That's the trade-off.

1227
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:56,531
(Siren wails)

1228
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:02,161
♪ JOHNNY OTIS: Willy And The Hand Jive

1229
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:11,796
♪ I know a cat named...

1230
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,549
RED: Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965

1231
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:16,676
on a two-year stretch for B&E.

1232
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,886
That's breaking and entering to you.

1233
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:23,599
The cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1234
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:25,435
Young punk.

1235
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:27,562
Mr Rock'n'roll.

1236
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:29,313
Cocky as hell.

1237
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,983
Hey, come on, old boys! Moving like molasses!

1238
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:33,985
Making me look bad.

1239
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,987
RED: We liked him immediately.

1240
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:38,114
So I'm backing out the door, right?

1241
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:39,907
And I got the TV like this.

1242
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:43,828
It was a big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Suddenly, I hear this voice.

1243
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:45,955
"Freeze, kid! Hands in the air."

1244
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:47,707
Well, I just stand there,

1245
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:50,585
holding onto that TV. So, finally, the voice says,

1246
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:52,628
"Do you hear what I said, boy?"

1247
01:24:52,713 --> 01:24:55,089
I say, "Yes, sir, I sure did.

1248
01:24:55,174 --> 01:24:58,801
But if I drop this fucking thing,
you got me on destruction of property, too."

1249
01:24:58,886 --> 01:25:00,970
(Laughter)

1250
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:05,600
Hey, you've done a stretch in Cashman, right?

1251
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:09,520
Yeah. Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1252
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:12,231
Weekend furloughs, work programmes.

1253
01:25:12,316 --> 01:25:13,733
Not like here.

1254
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:16,152
Sounds like you done time
all over New England.

1255
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:21,324
Yeah, I've been in and out since I was 13. You
name the place, chances are I've been there.

1256
01:25:21,408 --> 01:25:25,411
Perhaps it's time you tried a new profession?

1257
01:25:25,496 --> 01:25:30,583
What I mean is, you don't seem to be a good
thief. Maybe you should try something else.

1258
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:34,504
Yeah, well, what the hell
do you know about it, Capone?

1259
01:25:34,588 --> 01:25:36,339
What are you in for?

1260
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:38,007
Me?

1261
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:41,594
The lawyer fucked me.

1262
01:25:45,349 --> 01:25:48,726
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1263
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:53,105
(Laughter breaks out)

1264
01:25:56,235 --> 01:26:00,363
RED: As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1265
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:06,577
Maybe it was the thought of them on the streets
or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.

1266
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:10,456
Whatever it was,
something lit a fire under that boy's ass.

1267
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:17,713
I was thinking of maybe
trying for my high school equivalency.

1268
01:26:17,798 --> 01:26:20,383
I hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.

1269
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:23,761
I don't waste time on losers, Tommy.

1270
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:27,431
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1271
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:31,352
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1272
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:35,106
You really mean that?

1273
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,858
Yes, sir, I do.

1274
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:39,068
Good. Because if we do this,

1275
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:41,863
we do it all the way, 100%, nothing half-assed.

1276
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:45,074
The thing is, see...

1277
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:48,077
..I don't read so good.

1278
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:50,413
Well.

1279
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:54,250
You don't read...

1280
01:26:54,334 --> 01:26:56,377
so well.

1281
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,505
We'll get to that.

1282
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,383
- R.
- R...

1283
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:03,843
- S.
- S...

1284
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:06,095
RED: So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1285
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:08,556
He started walking him through his ABCs.

1286
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:12,852
Tommy took to it pretty well, too.

1287
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:15,855
The boy found brains he never knew he had.

1288
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:22,028
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1289
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:24,071
He really liked the kid.

1290
01:27:24,156 --> 01:27:27,283
It gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1291
01:27:28,368 --> 01:27:30,411
But that wasn't the only reason.

1292
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:32,914
Prison time is slow time.

1293
01:27:33,999 --> 01:27:36,250
So you do what you can to keep going.

1294
01:27:36,335 --> 01:27:38,544
Some fellas collect stamps.

1295
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:41,172
Others build matchstick houses.

1296
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:44,592
Andy built a library.

1297
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:47,720
Now he needed a new project.

1298
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:49,847
Tommy was it.

1299
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:54,143
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1300
01:27:54,227 --> 01:27:57,813
The same reason
he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1301
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,733
In prison,

1302
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:03,903
a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1303
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:09,825
By 1966, right about the time
Tommy was getting ready to take his exams,

1304
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:11,869
it was lovely Raquel.

1305
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:15,873
(Clock ticks)

1306
01:28:29,179 --> 01:28:30,179
Time.

1307
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:37,478
Well?

1308
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:40,147
Well, it's for shit.

1309
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:42,733
I wasted a whole fucking year of my time

1310
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:45,987
- with this bullshit.
- It's probably not as bad as you think.

1311
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:49,782
It's worse. I didn't get one thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1312
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:52,368
Let's see how the score comes out.

1313
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:55,037
Well, I'll tell you how the goddamn score
comes out.

1314
01:28:56,873 --> 01:28:58,791
Two points right there.

1315
01:28:58,875 --> 01:29:00,668
There's your goddamn score!

1316
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:04,547
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5x5 is 25.

1317
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:07,174
Fuck this place!

1318
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:08,467
Fuck it!

1319
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:30,072
I feel bad. I let him down.

1320
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:32,199
Ah, that's crap, kid.

1321
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:33,784
He's proud of you.

1322
01:29:33,869 --> 01:29:36,996
We've been friends a long time
so I know him as good as anybody.

1323
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,957
- A smart fellow, ain't he?
- As smart as they come.

1324
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:42,084
He used to be a banker on the outside.

1325
01:29:42,169 --> 01:29:44,211
What's he in here for, anyway?

1326
01:29:44,296 --> 01:29:45,796
Murder.

1327
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:48,632
The hell you say!

1328
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:53,054
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

1329
01:29:54,139 --> 01:29:56,599
He caught his wife in bed with some golf pro.

1330
01:29:56,683 --> 01:29:58,726
He greased them both.

1331
01:30:06,693 --> 01:30:08,527
What?

1332
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:10,988
About four years ago,

1333
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:14,116
I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

1334
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:18,454
I stole a car. It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1335
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:21,832
About six months left to go,

1336
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:23,959
I get a new cellmate in.

1337
01:30:24,044 --> 01:30:25,878
Elmo Blatch.

1338
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:28,506
Big, twitchy fucker.

1339
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:30,841
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.

1340
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:32,968
You know what I'm saying?

1341
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:35,096
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1342
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:38,390
He said he'd pulled hundreds of jobs.

1343
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:40,351
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.

1344
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:43,395
You'd cut a loud fart,
he'd jump three feet in the air.

1345
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:46,607
Talked all the time, too.

1346
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:49,026
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1347
01:30:49,111 --> 01:30:51,153
Places he'd been in,

1348
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:53,906
jobs he'd pulled, women he'd fucked.

1349
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:56,367
Even people he'd killed.

1350
01:30:58,245 --> 01:31:00,579
People who gave him shit.

1351
01:31:01,665 --> 01:31:03,707
That's how he put it.

1352
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:05,334
So...

1353
01:31:05,418 --> 01:31:07,461
one night, like a joke,

1354
01:31:08,547 --> 01:31:11,841
I say to him, I say,
"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

1355
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:13,717
So he says...

1356
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:17,388
I got me this job one time
bussing tables at a country club.

1357
01:31:18,557 --> 01:31:22,101
So I could case
all these big rich pricks that come in.

1358
01:31:24,563 --> 01:31:26,522
So I pick out this guy,

1359
01:31:27,607 --> 01:31:30,151
go in one night and do his place.

1360
01:31:32,362 --> 01:31:34,363
He wakes up.

1361
01:31:34,447 --> 01:31:36,448
He gives me shit.

1362
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:39,577
So I killed him.

1363
01:31:40,662 --> 01:31:42,705
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1364
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:46,917
That's the best part.

1365
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:51,213
She's fucking this prick, see, this golf pro.

1366
01:31:51,298 --> 01:31:53,340
But she's married to some other guy.

1367
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:56,468
Some hotshot banker.

1368
01:31:58,305 --> 01:32:00,347
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1369
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:15,321
I have to say
that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

1370
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:19,867
What amazes me most is
you were taken in by it.

1371
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:21,577
Sir?

1372
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:23,329
Well...

1373
01:32:23,413 --> 01:32:26,790
it's obvious this fella Williams
is impressed with you.

1374
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:28,959
He hears your tale of woe

1375
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:31,962
and quite naturally wants to cheer you up.

1376
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:34,089
He's young, not terribly bright.

1377
01:32:34,174 --> 01:32:38,052
Not surprising he wouldn't know
what a state he'd put you in.

1378
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:40,262
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1379
01:32:40,347 --> 01:32:44,391
Well, let's say, for the moment,
this Blatch does exist.

1380
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:47,603
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry,

1381
01:32:47,687 --> 01:32:49,897
"Yes, I did it! I confess!

1382
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:52,191
And by the way,
add a life term to my sentence"?

1383
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:55,444
That doesn't matter.
With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.

1384
01:32:55,528 --> 01:32:58,739
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

1385
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,866
The chances are he'd be released by now.

1386
01:33:00,951 --> 01:33:03,535
They'd have his last address,
names of relatives.

1387
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:05,746
There's a chance, isn't there?

1388
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:09,708
How can you be so obtuse?

1389
01:33:09,793 --> 01:33:11,252
What?

1390
01:33:12,796 --> 01:33:14,630
What did you call me?

1391
01:33:14,714 --> 01:33:16,548
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1392
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:18,425
Son, you're forgetting yourself.

1393
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:21,345
The country club will have his old timecards,

1394
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:23,514
records, W-2s,

1395
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:27,643
- with his name on them.
- If you indulge this fantasy, that's your business.

1396
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:31,647
- Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.
- Sir, if I were to ever get out,

1397
01:33:31,773 --> 01:33:36,735
I would never mention what goes on in here.
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering money.

1398
01:33:38,571 --> 01:33:41,573
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1399
01:33:41,658 --> 01:33:43,492
Not in this office.

1400
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:45,661
Not anywhere! Get in here now.

1401
01:33:45,745 --> 01:33:48,998
I'm just trying to set your mind at ease,
that's all. Sir, I...

1402
01:33:49,082 --> 01:33:50,457
Solitary. A month.

1403
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:52,710
- Yes, sir.
- What's the matter with you?

1404
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:56,005
- Get him out of here.
- This is my chance to get out! Don't you see?

1405
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:58,048
It's my life! Don't you understand?

1406
01:33:58,133 --> 01:34:00,592
- Get him out! Get him out!
- This is my life!

1407
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:01,927
No!

1408
01:34:02,012 --> 01:34:03,846
A month in the hole.

1409
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:06,515
It's the longest damn stretch I ever heard of.

1410
01:34:06,599 --> 01:34:08,392
It's all my fault.

1411
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:09,893
Oh, bullshit.

1412
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:13,272
You didn't pull the trigger
and you certainly didn't convict him.

1413
01:34:13,356 --> 01:34:15,733
Red, are you saying that Andy is innocent?

1414
01:34:15,817 --> 01:34:17,985
I mean, for real innocent?

1415
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:20,112
It looks that way.

1416
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:22,239
Sweet Jesus.

1417
01:34:22,324 --> 01:34:24,366
How long's he been here now?

1418
01:34:24,451 --> 01:34:26,493
1947. What is that?

1419
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:28,120
- 19 years.
TOMMY: 19 years...

1420
01:34:28,204 --> 01:34:30,789
GUARD: Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1421
01:34:33,209 --> 01:34:35,419
- Paxon, Edward.
- Yeah.

1422
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:39,590
What you got? Board of Education.

1423
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:42,343
- The son of a bitch mailed it.
- Looks like he did.

1424
01:34:42,427 --> 01:34:45,471
Are you gonna open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1425
01:34:45,555 --> 01:34:47,598
The thumb up my butt sounds better.

1426
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:51,393
Hey, Skeet, come on,
give me that, you shithead.

1427
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:54,646
- Floyd, come on.
- Over here, over here!

1428
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:57,775
Hey, Red!

1429
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:01,320
Come on, will you throw that away, please?

1430
01:35:06,993 --> 01:35:09,036
Well, shit.

1431
01:35:21,257 --> 01:35:23,967
The kid passed. C+ average.

1432
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:26,095
Thought you'd like to know.

1433
01:35:42,695 --> 01:35:44,738
The Warden wants to talk.

1434
01:35:58,169 --> 01:35:59,294
Out here?

1435
01:35:59,379 --> 01:36:01,422
That's what the man said.

1436
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:19,565
Warden?

1437
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:21,692
Tommy.

1438
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:28,657
Tommy...

1439
01:36:28,741 --> 01:36:32,786
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1440
01:36:34,247 --> 01:36:36,290
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1441
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,852
We got a situation here.

1442
01:36:57,937 --> 01:36:59,980
I think you can appreciate that.

1443
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:01,523
Yes, sir.

1444
01:37:01,608 --> 01:37:03,108
I sure can.

1445
01:37:03,193 --> 01:37:07,196
I tell you, son, this thing really came along
and knocked my wind out.

1446
01:37:08,948 --> 01:37:11,450
It's got me up nights, that's the truth.

1447
01:37:13,703 --> 01:37:15,746
The right thing to do.

1448
01:37:17,123 --> 01:37:20,083
Sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

1449
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:23,837
You understand?

1450
01:37:25,256 --> 01:37:27,299
I need your help, son.

1451
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,802
If I'm going to move on this,

1452
01:37:30,887 --> 01:37:33,555
there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

1453
01:37:35,141 --> 01:37:38,560
I have to know
if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

1454
01:37:38,645 --> 01:37:40,187
Yes, sir.

1455
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:41,855
Absolutely.

1456
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:45,025
Would you be willing
to swear before a judge and jury,

1457
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:47,486
having placed your hand on the Good Book

1458
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:50,239
and taken an oath before Almighty God himself?

1459
01:37:50,323 --> 01:37:52,407
Just give me that chance.

1460
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:57,996
That's what I thought.

1461
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:32,531
(Keys rattle)

1462
01:38:45,128 --> 01:38:47,170
I'm sure by now you've heard...

1463
01:38:48,464 --> 01:38:49,798
A terrible thing.

1464
01:38:51,301 --> 01:38:54,845
A man that young, less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1465
01:38:55,972 --> 01:38:58,557
It broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

1466
01:38:59,642 --> 01:39:01,685
Truly, it did.

1467
01:39:03,771 --> 01:39:05,814
We just have to put it behind us.

1468
01:39:08,026 --> 01:39:09,401
Move on.

1469
01:39:10,903 --> 01:39:12,738
I'm done.

1470
01:39:13,823 --> 01:39:15,866
Everything stops.

1471
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:19,745
Get someone else to run your scams.

1472
01:39:21,122 --> 01:39:23,165
Nothing stops.

1473
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:26,293
Nothing.

1474
01:39:28,087 --> 01:39:30,130
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1475
01:39:32,050 --> 01:39:34,635
No more protection from the guards.

1476
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:37,054
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton

1477
01:39:37,138 --> 01:39:39,264
and cast you down with the Sodomites.

1478
01:39:41,059 --> 01:39:43,518
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

1479
01:39:44,854 --> 01:39:46,897
And the library?

1480
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:48,106
Gone.

1481
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:50,525
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1482
01:39:51,653 --> 01:39:54,404
We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.

1483
01:39:54,489 --> 01:39:56,531
They'll see the flames for miles.

1484
01:39:56,616 --> 01:39:59,076
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1485
01:40:00,703 --> 01:40:02,621
You understand me?

1486
01:40:02,705 --> 01:40:04,748
Catching my drift?

1487
01:40:07,877 --> 01:40:09,920
Or am I being obtuse?

1488
01:40:21,099 --> 01:40:23,183
Give him another month to think about it.

1489
01:40:31,734 --> 01:40:33,777
(Lock clicks)

1490
01:41:10,815 --> 01:41:13,859
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

1491
01:41:13,943 --> 01:41:15,986
Like a closed book.

1492
01:41:17,238 --> 01:41:19,990
Complained about it all the time.

1493
01:41:20,074 --> 01:41:22,117
She was beautiful.

1494
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:26,413
God, I loved her.

1495
01:41:29,459 --> 01:41:31,752
I just didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1496
01:41:34,297 --> 01:41:36,339
I killed her, Red.

1497
01:41:37,842 --> 01:41:39,885
I didn't pull the trigger.

1498
01:41:41,345 --> 01:41:43,388
But I drove her away.

1499
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:47,184
That's why she died, because of me.

1500
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:49,311
The way I am.

1501
01:41:57,695 --> 01:41:59,738
That don't make you a murderer.

1502
01:42:02,992 --> 01:42:05,035
A bad husband, maybe.

1503
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:11,833
Feel bad about it if you want to,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1504
01:42:11,918 --> 01:42:13,335
No, I didn't.

1505
01:42:13,419 --> 01:42:15,420
Somebody else did.

1506
01:42:16,756 --> 01:42:18,799
And I wound up in here.

1507
01:42:21,219 --> 01:42:23,261
Bad luck, I guess.

1508
01:42:26,224 --> 01:42:27,933
Yeah.

1509
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:30,310
It floats around.

1510
01:42:30,394 --> 01:42:32,854
It's got to land on somebody.

1511
01:42:32,939 --> 01:42:35,148
It was my turn, that's all.

1512
01:42:36,275 --> 01:42:38,693
I was in the path of the tornado.

1513
01:42:45,326 --> 01:42:49,037
I just didn't expect
the storm would last as long as it has.

1514
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:55,043
Do you think you'll ever get out of here?

1515
01:42:56,337 --> 01:42:57,963
Me?

1516
01:43:00,299 --> 01:43:01,716
Yeah.

1517
01:43:02,802 --> 01:43:04,719
One day, when I've got a long, white beard

1518
01:43:04,846 --> 01:43:08,306
and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs,
they'll let me out.

1519
01:43:10,268 --> 01:43:12,310
I tell you where I'd go.

1520
01:43:13,563 --> 01:43:15,188
Zihuatanejo.

1521
01:43:15,273 --> 01:43:17,190
Zi...what?

1522
01:43:17,275 --> 01:43:19,317
Zihuatanejo.

1523
01:43:19,402 --> 01:43:21,444
It's in Mexico.

1524
01:43:23,281 --> 01:43:25,448
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1525
01:43:26,742 --> 01:43:29,119
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1526
01:43:29,203 --> 01:43:30,662
No.

1527
01:43:30,746 --> 01:43:32,789
They say it has no memory.

1528
01:43:35,293 --> 01:43:37,794
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

1529
01:43:39,422 --> 01:43:41,464
A warm place with no memory.

1530
01:43:44,802 --> 01:43:47,053
Open up a little hotel,

1531
01:43:48,931 --> 01:43:50,807
right on the beach.

1532
01:43:50,892 --> 01:43:52,934
Buy some worthless old boat,

1533
01:43:53,019 --> 01:43:55,061
fix it up new.

1534
01:43:58,065 --> 01:43:59,274
Take my guests out.

1535
01:43:59,358 --> 01:44:01,401
Charter fishing.

1536
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:07,949
Zihuatanejo, huh?

1537
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:14,456
In a place like that, I could use a man
who knows how to get things.

1538
01:44:20,922 --> 01:44:23,590
I don't think I could make it on the outside, Andy.

1539
01:44:30,389 --> 01:44:32,432
I've been in here most of my life.

1540
01:44:33,976 --> 01:44:35,769
I'm an institutional man now.

1541
01:44:35,853 --> 01:44:37,896
Just like Brooks was.

1542
01:44:39,357 --> 01:44:41,608
Well, you underestimate yourself.

1543
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:43,735
I don't think so.

1544
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:50,617
I mean...in here, I'm the guy
who can get things for you, sure.

1545
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:54,621
But outside, all you need is the Yellow Pages.

1546
01:44:54,705 --> 01:44:57,082
Hell, I wouldn't even know where to begin.

1547
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:01,544
The Pacific Ocean?

1548
01:45:01,629 --> 01:45:03,672
Shit.

1549
01:45:03,756 --> 01:45:06,925
- About scare me to death, something that big.
- Not me.

1550
01:45:07,009 --> 01:45:10,428
I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover.

1551
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:16,017
Whatever mistakes I've made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1552
01:45:16,102 --> 01:45:18,228
That hotel, that boat.

1553
01:45:19,855 --> 01:45:21,982
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1554
01:45:26,654 --> 01:45:29,531
I don't think you ought to be
doing this to yourself, Andy.

1555
01:45:29,615 --> 01:45:31,658
These are just shitty pipe dreams.

1556
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:34,703
I mean, Mexico is way the hell down there
and you're in here.

1557
01:45:34,787 --> 01:45:36,830
And that's the way it is.

1558
01:45:36,914 --> 01:45:39,499
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1559
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:43,336
It's down there and I'm in here.

1560
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:48,842
I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really.

1561
01:45:51,721 --> 01:45:53,763
Get busy living

1562
01:45:53,848 --> 01:45:56,725
or get busy dying.

1563
01:46:00,563 --> 01:46:02,605
Andy.

1564
01:46:05,109 --> 01:46:07,152
Red.

1565
01:46:08,237 --> 01:46:10,655
If you ever get out of here, do me a favour.

1566
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:12,574
Sure, Andy.

1567
01:46:12,658 --> 01:46:13,950
Anything.

1568
01:46:15,077 --> 01:46:18,496
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1569
01:46:20,541 --> 01:46:24,335
- Well, just... There's a lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1570
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:26,463
It's got a long rock wall

1571
01:46:26,547 --> 01:46:28,465
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1572
01:46:28,549 --> 01:46:31,217
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

1573
01:46:32,636 --> 01:46:35,305
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1574
01:46:36,557 --> 01:46:40,351
We went there for a picnic
and made love under that oak.

1575
01:46:41,854 --> 01:46:43,897
I asked and she said yes.

1576
01:46:48,069 --> 01:46:50,111
Promise me, Red,

1577
01:46:50,196 --> 01:46:52,197
if you ever get out,

1578
01:46:52,281 --> 01:46:54,282
find that spot.

1579
01:46:55,367 --> 01:47:00,830
At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that has
no earthly business in a Maine hayfield.

1580
01:47:00,915 --> 01:47:03,374
A piece of black, volcanic glass.

1581
01:47:06,587 --> 01:47:09,380
There's something buried under it
I want you to have.

1582
01:47:09,465 --> 01:47:11,466
What, Andy?

1583
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:13,593
What's buried under there?

1584
01:47:15,429 --> 01:47:18,765
You'll have to pry it up to see.

1585
01:47:24,188 --> 01:47:26,231
No, I'm telling you, the guy is...

1586
01:47:27,316 --> 01:47:29,359
He's talking funnier.

1587
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:32,821
- I'm really worried about him.
- We ought to keep an eye on him.

1588
01:47:32,905 --> 01:47:36,908
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's got that cell all to himself.

1589
01:47:38,035 --> 01:47:39,494
Oh, Lord.

1590
01:47:39,578 --> 01:47:41,579
What?

1591
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:45,625
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

1592
01:47:45,709 --> 01:47:49,212
- He asked me for a length of rope.
- Rope?

1593
01:47:49,296 --> 01:47:51,131
Six feet long.

1594
01:47:51,215 --> 01:47:52,674
And you gave it to him?

1595
01:47:52,758 --> 01:47:55,385
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

1596
01:47:55,469 --> 01:47:57,137
Jesus, Heywood.

1597
01:47:57,221 --> 01:47:59,472
Hey, how the hell was I supposed to know?

1598
01:47:59,557 --> 01:48:01,474
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1599
01:48:01,559 --> 01:48:02,559
No.

1600
01:48:03,644 --> 01:48:05,812
Andy would never do that.

1601
01:48:05,896 --> 01:48:07,939
Never.

1602
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:11,067
I don't know.

1603
01:48:13,112 --> 01:48:15,155
Every man has his breaking point.

1604
01:48:17,825 --> 01:48:19,075
Lickety-split.

1605
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:21,995
- I want to get home.
- Just about finished, sir.

1606
01:48:38,137 --> 01:48:40,180
Three deposits tonight.

1607
01:48:48,606 --> 01:48:50,648
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1608
01:48:50,733 --> 01:48:54,152
And shine my shoes.
I want 'em looking like mirrors.

1609
01:48:54,236 --> 01:48:55,570
Yes, sir.

1610
01:49:00,910 --> 01:49:02,577
It's good having you back, Andy.

1611
01:49:02,661 --> 01:49:05,371
The place wasn't the same without you.

1612
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:09,584
(Whistles)

1613
01:49:52,461 --> 01:49:55,171
GUARD: Lights out!
(Click of light switches)

1614
01:49:59,551 --> 01:50:01,594
(Footsteps)

1615
01:50:07,476 --> 01:50:09,519
(Outer door closes)

1616
01:50:25,953 --> 01:50:28,204
RED: I've had some long nights in stir.

1617
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:32,000
Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts,

1618
01:50:32,084 --> 01:50:33,876
time can draw out like a blade.

1619
01:50:33,961 --> 01:50:36,004
(Thunder rumbles)

1620
01:50:40,301 --> 01:50:42,593
That was the longest night of my life.

1621
01:50:52,855 --> 01:50:55,148
(Gate buzzer)

1622
01:50:58,777 --> 01:51:00,361
GUARD: Give me a count.

1623
01:51:04,742 --> 01:51:06,784
Tier 3 South. Clear.

1624
01:51:06,869 --> 01:51:08,202
Tier 4 North. Clear.

1625
01:51:08,287 --> 01:51:11,873
- Tier 3 North. Clear.
- Man missing on Tier 2.

1626
01:51:11,957 --> 01:51:15,043
- Cell 245.
- Dufresne.

1627
01:51:15,127 --> 01:51:18,004
Get your ass out here, boy.
You're holding up the show.

1628
01:51:20,549 --> 01:51:24,552
Don't make me come down there.
I'll thump your skull for you.

1629
01:51:32,186 --> 01:51:35,563
Damn it, Dufresne, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1630
01:51:35,647 --> 01:51:38,733
You'd better be sick or dead in there,
I shit you not!

1631
01:51:38,817 --> 01:51:40,610
You hear me?

1632
01:51:47,159 --> 01:51:49,202
Oh, my holy God.

1633
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:03,383
(Siren wails)

1634
01:52:06,095 --> 01:52:08,763
I want every man on this cell block questioned.

1635
01:52:08,847 --> 01:52:11,015
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1636
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:12,266
Him!

1637
01:52:14,228 --> 01:52:16,270
Open 237.

1638
01:52:19,316 --> 01:52:21,442
What do you mean, he just wasn't here?

1639
01:52:21,527 --> 01:52:23,069
Don't say that to me, Haig.

1640
01:52:23,153 --> 01:52:25,405
Don't say that to me again.

1641
01:52:25,489 --> 01:52:26,572
But, sir, he wasn't.

1642
01:52:26,657 --> 01:52:28,825
I can see that, Haig!

1643
01:52:28,909 --> 01:52:30,660
You think I'm blind?

1644
01:52:30,744 --> 01:52:33,830
Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig?

1645
01:52:33,914 --> 01:52:34,914
No, sir.

1646
01:52:34,998 --> 01:52:37,041
What about you?

1647
01:52:37,126 --> 01:52:38,960
Are you blind?

1648
01:52:39,044 --> 01:52:41,587
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1649
01:52:41,672 --> 01:52:44,966
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. See? Right there.

1650
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:46,884
Dufresne.

1651
01:52:48,178 --> 01:52:49,846
He was in his cell at lights out.

1652
01:52:49,930 --> 01:52:53,099
It stands to reason
he'd still be here in the morning.

1653
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:56,102
I want him found.

1654
01:52:56,186 --> 01:52:58,771
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast.

1655
01:52:58,856 --> 01:52:59,856
Now!

1656
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:01,357
Yes, sir!

1657
01:53:02,526 --> 01:53:05,111
Let's go, let's go!
Move your butts! Move it!

1658
01:53:07,948 --> 01:53:08,948
Stand.

1659
01:53:10,117 --> 01:53:11,367
Well?

1660
01:53:14,746 --> 01:53:15,872
Well, what?

1661
01:53:15,956 --> 01:53:19,375
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1662
01:53:20,461 --> 01:53:22,086
He must have said something.

1663
01:53:22,171 --> 01:53:24,213
No, sir, Warden.

1664
01:53:24,298 --> 01:53:25,715
Not a word.

1665
01:53:27,759 --> 01:53:29,719
Lord, it's a miracle!

1666
01:53:30,804 --> 01:53:33,264
A man up and vanished like a fart in the wind.

1667
01:53:33,348 --> 01:53:35,099
Nothing left but...

1668
01:53:35,184 --> 01:53:38,102
some damn rocks on a windowsill.

1669
01:53:38,187 --> 01:53:39,937
And that cupcake on the wall.

1670
01:53:40,022 --> 01:53:41,647
Let's ask her.

1671
01:53:41,732 --> 01:53:45,651
Maybe she knows. What say there,
Fuzzy Britches? Feel like talking?

1672
01:53:46,778 --> 01:53:47,820
Ah...

1673
01:53:47,905 --> 01:53:49,322
I guess not.

1674
01:53:49,406 --> 01:53:52,283
Why should she be any different?

1675
01:53:52,367 --> 01:53:54,827
This is a conspiracy.

1676
01:53:54,912 --> 01:53:57,121
That's what this is.

1677
01:53:57,206 --> 01:53:58,748
One big...

1678
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:01,584
damn conspiracy!

1679
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:04,337
And everyone's in on it!

1680
01:54:04,421 --> 01:54:05,671
Including her!

1681
01:54:07,049 --> 01:54:08,674
(Clattering)

1682
01:54:32,491 --> 01:54:34,158
(Sirens blare)

1683
01:54:40,374 --> 01:54:42,250
RED: In 1966,

1684
01:54:42,334 --> 01:54:45,002
Andy Dufresne escaped

1685
01:54:45,087 --> 01:54:47,129
from Shawshank Prison.

1686
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:51,592
All they found of him
was a muddy set of prison clothes,

1687
01:54:51,677 --> 01:54:53,719
a bar of soap

1688
01:54:53,804 --> 01:54:58,140
and an old rock hammer
damn near worn down to the nub.

1689
01:55:02,563 --> 01:55:07,400
I remember thinking it would take a man
600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

1690
01:55:07,484 --> 01:55:10,152
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1691
01:55:28,755 --> 01:55:30,798
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1692
01:55:31,883 --> 01:55:35,386
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.

1693
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:37,763
An Ice Age here,

1694
01:55:37,848 --> 01:55:40,391
a million years of mountain-building there.

1695
01:55:41,476 --> 01:55:43,853
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

1696
01:55:45,105 --> 01:55:47,148
That's all it takes, really.

1697
01:55:47,232 --> 01:55:49,275
Pressure...

1698
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:51,235
and time.

1699
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:54,614
That and a big goddamn poster.

1700
01:55:55,741 --> 01:55:57,783
(Coughing)

1701
01:55:57,868 --> 01:55:59,201
Like I said,

1702
01:55:59,286 --> 01:56:02,997
in prison, a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1703
01:56:05,834 --> 01:56:11,005
It turns out Andy's favourite hobby
was toting his wall out into the exercise yard.

1704
01:56:11,089 --> 01:56:13,132
A handful at a time.

1705
01:56:15,010 --> 01:56:17,178
I guess after Tommy was killed,

1706
01:56:17,262 --> 01:56:20,097
Andy decided he'd been here
just about long enough.

1707
01:56:20,182 --> 01:56:22,350
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

1708
01:56:23,685 --> 01:56:25,728
I'm just about finished, sir.

1709
01:56:47,167 --> 01:56:49,210
Three deposits tonight.

1710
01:56:56,426 --> 01:56:58,427
Andy did like he was told.

1711
01:56:59,513 --> 01:57:02,973
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine.

1712
01:57:06,603 --> 01:57:08,646
The guard simply didn't notice.

1713
01:57:08,730 --> 01:57:10,773
Neither did I.

1714
01:57:10,857 --> 01:57:15,152
I mean, seriously, how often
do you really look at a man's shoes?

1715
01:57:49,896 --> 01:57:51,939
(Thunderclap)

1716
01:59:19,236 --> 01:59:25,407
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards
of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

1717
01:59:25,492 --> 01:59:26,659
(Gags)

1718
01:59:26,743 --> 01:59:28,744
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1719
01:59:28,829 --> 01:59:30,871
(Coughs and spits)

1720
01:59:33,458 --> 01:59:35,626
500 yards.

1721
01:59:36,711 --> 01:59:39,171
That's the length of five football fields.

1722
01:59:40,257 --> 01:59:42,466
Just shy of half a mile.

1723
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:25,718
(Laughs)

1724
02:00:37,731 --> 02:00:42,276
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her little secret,

1725
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:45,779
a man nobody ever laid eyes on before

1726
02:00:45,864 --> 02:00:48,282
strode into the Maine National Bank.

1727
02:00:48,366 --> 02:00:50,409
Until that moment,

1728
02:00:50,493 --> 02:00:52,369
he didn't exist,

1729
02:00:52,454 --> 02:00:53,787
except on paper.

1730
02:00:53,872 --> 02:00:54,914
May I help you?

1731
02:00:54,998 --> 02:00:57,041
RED: He had all the proper ID,

1732
02:00:57,125 --> 02:01:00,753
driver's licence, birth certificate,
social security card.

1733
02:01:00,837 --> 02:01:04,131
And the signature was a spot-on match.

1734
02:01:04,215 --> 02:01:07,259
I must say, I'm sorry to be losing your business.

1735
02:01:07,344 --> 02:01:09,345
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1736
02:01:09,429 --> 02:01:11,221
Thank you.

1737
02:01:11,306 --> 02:01:13,098
I'm sure I will.

1738
02:01:13,183 --> 02:01:15,309
Here's your cashier's cheque, sir.

1739
02:01:15,393 --> 02:01:17,436
Will there be anything else?

1740
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:18,520
Please...

1741
02:01:18,605 --> 02:01:21,690
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?

1742
02:01:21,775 --> 02:01:23,984
I'd be happy to.

1743
02:01:24,069 --> 02:01:26,362
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

1744
02:01:26,488 --> 02:01:31,241
RED: Mr Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1745
02:01:32,452 --> 02:01:38,916
All told, he blew town with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

1746
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,460
Severance pay for 19 years.

1747
02:01:41,544 --> 02:01:43,587
(Phone rings)

1748
02:01:49,594 --> 02:01:51,845
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1749
02:01:59,562 --> 02:02:01,605
(Sirens wail)

1750
02:02:30,844 --> 02:02:32,845
(Sirens approaching)

1751
02:02:44,607 --> 02:02:47,568
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1752
02:02:47,694 --> 02:02:52,322
If you give up the right to remain silent, anything
you say will be held against you in court.

1753
02:02:52,407 --> 02:02:54,283
RED: I wasn't there to see it.

1754
02:02:54,367 --> 02:02:59,204
But I hear Byron Hadley started sobbing
like a little girl when they took him away.

1755
02:03:04,669 --> 02:03:07,421
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

1756
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:24,897
Samuel Norton?

1757
02:03:24,981 --> 02:03:28,192
- We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.
(Banging on door)

1758
02:03:31,112 --> 02:03:32,237
Norton!

1759
02:03:32,322 --> 02:03:33,989
Open the door.

1760
02:03:34,074 --> 02:03:35,783
I'm not sure which key it is.

1761
02:03:38,703 --> 02:03:40,329
Norton!

1762
02:03:45,835 --> 02:03:47,878
Make it easy on yourself, Norton.

1763
02:03:59,224 --> 02:04:02,810
RED: I like to think
the last thing that went through his head,

1764
02:04:02,894 --> 02:04:04,603
other than that bullet,

1765
02:04:04,687 --> 02:04:08,649
was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1766
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:11,443
Carter, James...

1767
02:04:11,528 --> 02:04:14,905
RED: Not long after the Warden
deprived us of his company,

1768
02:04:14,989 --> 02:04:17,199
I got a postcard in the mail.

1769
02:04:18,952 --> 02:04:21,370
It was blank but the postmark said...

1770
02:04:21,454 --> 02:04:24,206
Fort Hancock, Texas.

1771
02:04:24,290 --> 02:04:26,333
Fort Hancock.

1772
02:04:26,417 --> 02:04:28,460
Right on the border.

1773
02:04:28,545 --> 02:04:30,587
That's where Andy crossed.

1774
02:04:30,672 --> 02:04:34,508
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down,

1775
02:04:35,593 --> 02:04:37,636
it always makes me laugh.

1776
02:04:39,097 --> 02:04:41,140
Andy Dufresne,

1777
02:04:41,224 --> 02:04:43,600
who crawled through a river of shit

1778
02:04:43,685 --> 02:04:45,727
and came out clean on the other side.

1779
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:49,022
Andy Dufresne,

1780
02:04:49,107 --> 02:04:51,024
headed for the Pacific.

1781
02:04:53,611 --> 02:04:55,654
Hadley's got him by the toes, right?

1782
02:04:55,738 --> 02:04:59,950
And he says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1783
02:05:00,034 --> 02:05:03,203
RED: Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1784
02:05:03,288 --> 02:05:05,539
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1785
02:05:05,623 --> 02:05:08,125
"These friends of mine
could use a couple of beers!"

1786
02:05:08,209 --> 02:05:10,252
- And he got it.
- And he got it!

1787
02:05:11,462 --> 02:05:13,839
RED: Sometimes it makes me sad, though,

1788
02:05:13,923 --> 02:05:15,966
Andy being gone.

1789
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:20,012
I have to remind myself
that some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1790
02:05:21,139 --> 02:05:23,182
Their feathers are just too bright.

1791
02:05:24,767 --> 02:05:26,810
And when they fly away,

1792
02:05:26,895 --> 02:05:30,772
the part of you that knows
it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1793
02:05:32,567 --> 02:05:34,026
But still...

1794
02:05:34,110 --> 02:05:38,238
the place you live in is that much more drab
and empty that they're gone.

1795
02:05:42,827 --> 02:05:45,037
I guess I just miss my friend.

1796
02:06:09,062 --> 02:06:10,896
Please sit down.

1797
02:06:16,527 --> 02:06:18,654
Ellis Boyd Redding.

1798
02:06:18,738 --> 02:06:22,115
Your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1799
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:24,534
Do you feel you've been rehabilitated?

1800
02:06:26,704 --> 02:06:28,747
Rehabilitated?

1801
02:06:30,333 --> 02:06:32,376
Well, now, let me see.

1802
02:06:33,461 --> 02:06:35,754
You know, I don't have any idea
what that means.

1803
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:40,133
Well, it means you're ready to rejoin society...

1804
02:06:40,218 --> 02:06:42,719
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1805
02:06:45,139 --> 02:06:47,182
To me, it's just a made-up word.

1806
02:06:48,268 --> 02:06:50,519
A politician's word so that...

1807
02:06:50,603 --> 02:06:56,066
young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie and have a job.

1808
02:06:58,528 --> 02:07:00,570
What do you really want to know?

1809
02:07:01,781 --> 02:07:03,699
Am I sorry for what I did?

1810
02:07:03,783 --> 02:07:05,450
Well, are you?

1811
02:07:07,120 --> 02:07:09,663
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

1812
02:07:11,291 --> 02:07:14,376
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1813
02:07:18,214 --> 02:07:20,257
I look back on the way I was then.

1814
02:07:22,885 --> 02:07:24,928
A young...

1815
02:07:25,013 --> 02:07:28,056
stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

1816
02:07:31,936 --> 02:07:33,979
I wanna talk to him.

1817
02:07:35,398 --> 02:07:37,524
I wanna try and talk some sense to him,

1818
02:07:38,609 --> 02:07:40,652
tell him the way things are.

1819
02:07:42,864 --> 02:07:44,906
But I can't.

1820
02:07:46,159 --> 02:07:48,201
That kid's long gone.

1821
02:07:49,537 --> 02:07:51,580
This old man is all that's left.

1822
02:07:53,750 --> 02:07:55,208
I gotta live with that.

1823
02:07:56,586 --> 02:07:58,378
Rehabilitated?

1824
02:07:58,463 --> 02:08:00,464
It's just a bullshit word.

1825
02:08:00,548 --> 02:08:06,428
So you go on and stamp your form, sonny,
and stop wasting my time.

1826
02:08:07,555 --> 02:08:09,598
Because to tell you the truth,

1827
02:08:09,682 --> 02:08:12,142
I don't give a shit.

1828
02:08:50,306 --> 02:08:52,349
(Gate closes)

1829
02:09:11,786 --> 02:09:13,829
(Siren passes outside)

1830
02:09:38,396 --> 02:09:40,439
Here you go, miss.

1831
02:09:42,483 --> 02:09:43,900
Rest room break, boss?

1832
02:09:49,991 --> 02:09:54,244
You don't need to ask me every time you need
to go take a piss. Just go. Understand?

1833
02:09:55,496 --> 02:09:57,122
Yes, sir.

1834
02:10:07,216 --> 02:10:10,218
RED: 40 years
I've been asking permission to piss.

1835
02:10:11,262 --> 02:10:13,430
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1836
02:10:17,602 --> 02:10:19,644
There's a harsh truth to face.

1837
02:10:21,647 --> 02:10:23,940
No way I'm gonna make it on the outside.

1838
02:10:32,200 --> 02:10:35,619
All I do any more
is think of ways to break my parole...

1839
02:10:36,704 --> 02:10:38,747
..so maybe they'd send me back.

1840
02:10:44,295 --> 02:10:46,338
A terrible thing to live in fear.

1841
02:10:47,757 --> 02:10:51,092
Brooks Hatlen knew it, knew it all too well.

1842
02:10:53,304 --> 02:10:56,056
All I want is to be back
where things make sense,

1843
02:10:57,141 --> 02:10:59,601
where I won't have to be afraid all the time.

1844
02:11:02,522 --> 02:11:04,564
Only one thing stops me.

1845
02:11:05,650 --> 02:11:07,692
A promise I made to Andy.

1846
02:11:28,464 --> 02:11:30,507
Here it is.

1847
02:11:40,351 --> 02:11:42,394
Much obliged, sir.

1848
02:15:05,681 --> 02:15:07,724
(Bird calls)

1849
02:15:21,238 --> 02:15:22,530
ANDY: Dear Red,

1850
02:15:22,615 --> 02:15:25,074
if you're reading this, you've gotten out.

1851
02:15:25,159 --> 02:15:29,412
And if you've come this far,
maybe you're willing to come a little further.

1852
02:15:29,497 --> 02:15:32,040
You remember the name of the town, don't you?

1853
02:15:34,418 --> 02:15:36,461
Zihuatanejo.

1854
02:15:37,546 --> 02:15:38,713
I could use a good man

1855
02:15:38,798 --> 02:15:40,840
to help me get my project on wheels.

1856
02:15:40,925 --> 02:15:43,051
I'll keep an eye out for you

1857
02:15:43,135 --> 02:15:45,136
and the chessboard ready.

1858
02:15:46,222 --> 02:15:47,597
Remember, Red,

1859
02:15:47,681 --> 02:15:49,724
hope is a good thing.

1860
02:15:49,809 --> 02:15:51,851
Maybe the best of things.

1861
02:15:51,936 --> 02:15:53,978
And no good thing ever dies.

1862
02:15:55,064 --> 02:15:57,524
I will be hoping that this letter finds you

1863
02:15:57,608 --> 02:15:59,651
and finds you well.

1864
02:15:59,735 --> 02:16:02,195
Your friend, Andy.

1865
02:16:36,814 --> 02:16:40,650
RED: Get busy living or get busy dying.

1866
02:16:43,237 --> 02:16:45,280
That's goddamn right.

1867
02:16:50,786 --> 02:16:52,912
For the second time in my life,

1868
02:16:52,997 --> 02:16:55,039
I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1869
02:16:56,750 --> 02:16:58,793
Parole violation.

1870
02:16:58,878 --> 02:17:02,505
Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1871
02:17:03,799 --> 02:17:05,842
Not for an old crook like me.

1872
02:17:05,926 --> 02:17:07,969
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1873
02:17:11,724 --> 02:17:15,810
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still
or hold a thought in my head.

1874
02:17:16,896 --> 02:17:19,898
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1875
02:17:19,982 --> 02:17:22,692
A free man at the start of a long journey

1876
02:17:22,776 --> 02:17:25,653
whose conclusion is uncertain.

1877
02:17:28,574 --> 02:17:30,700
I hope I can make it across the border.

1878
02:17:32,620 --> 02:17:35,371
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

1879
02:17:37,791 --> 02:17:40,960
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1880
02:17:43,756 --> 02:17:45,590
I hope.
