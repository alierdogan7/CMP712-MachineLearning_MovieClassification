1
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,879
Here.

2
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,873
Here?

3
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,077
Yes here you are in your new home.

4
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,112
Brother Hsu lives over there.

5
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,078
It`s very crowded here.

6
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,479
We`ll get there in 10 minutes.

7
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,315
Remember, you`re a stranger here.

8
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,268
Take care of yourself,
and don`t start any trouble.

9
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,668
I know.

10
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,796
You must be thirsty.

11
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,876
Let`s get something to drink.

12
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,395
- Two bowls, please.
- OK.

13
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,234
Come on, let`s go.

14
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,029
Do you have any hot ices?

15
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,519
Hot ice?

16
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,070
Give me some and I`ll pay you double.

17
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,993
She`s pretty.

18
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,315
Come, let`s have a look at you!

19
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,038
Not bad at all!

20
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,071
- Nice complexion. Look!
- Let go!

21
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,590
- Stay out of this!
- Let me go!

22
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,676
Don`t forget your promise!

23
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,155
Don`t be afraid. Keep us company!

24
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,678
Dumplings! Hot dumplings!

25
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,556
Let me try.

26
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,552
Hmm, pretty tasty. Come and get some!

27
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,869
Have some.

28
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,633
Take the basket.

29
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,359
You have to pay!

30
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,633
You can`t eat without paying!

31
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,716
Pay? Pay for what?

32
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,353
What money?

33
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,636
Get out of here.

34
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,909
What happened?

35
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,958
They refused to pay and then hit me!

36
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,350
Why did you bully the kid?

37
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,397
Stay out of it
or you`ll get the same!

38
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,668
It`s Hsu Chien!

39
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,432
- Hsu?
- Oh, yes...

40
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,914
Come on!

41
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,394
Hold it.

42
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,029
Hsu Chien!

43
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,874
Uncle!

44
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,637
When did you arrive?

45
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,876
Just now. I came looking for you.

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,399
I got your letter.

47
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,549
This is...

48
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,675
Cheng Chao An.

49
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,953
Come to my place!

50
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,433
Come out everybody...

51
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,357
Uncle...

52
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,473
This is my nephew Chen Chao An.

53
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,555
My name`s Ah San.

54
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,629
I`m Ah Yin.

55
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,675
I`m Ah Wang.

56
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,637
- Ah Pi.
- I`m Ah Chang.

57
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,599
I`m Ah Kun.

58
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,553
Cheng Chao An.

59
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,433
Come in and sit down. Come in.

60
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,152
Take Uncle`s luggage!

61
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,919
It`s been two whole years!

62
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,638
Sit down.

63
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,113
Come on, let`s catch up.

64
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,079
How are things back home?

65
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,789
There`ve been many floods.

66
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,831
Times are bad.

67
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,598
There`s no getting around it.

68
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,153
Have some tea, Uncle.

69
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,393
My! You`ve grown into a pretty girl.

70
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,517
She`s our little sister Chiao Mei.

71
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,159
This is Cheng Chao An.

72
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,478
Have some tea.

73
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,755
Thank you.

74
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,832
How`s old Mr Chang?

75
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,951
He fell ill

76
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,873
and died five months ago.

77
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,752
What about the Chen girl Yu Fang?

78
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,149
Yu Fang?
She wanted to escape the famine,

79
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,435
so she got married and went away.

80
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,836
Old Mr Wang, who used to live here,

81
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,475
left a month ago for home
to find a wife.

82
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,994
- Did you meet him?
- Old Wang?

83
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,553
I didn`t see him.

84
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,473
Who can afford a wife nowadays?

85
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,676
Take the teahouse next door.

86
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,991
They`ve closed for lack of business.

87
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,556
People are heading for the cities.

88
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,870
They can`t stay in the country.

89
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,073
You`ve been away a long time.

90
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,918
Yes.

91
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,029
My letter explained why I came here.

92
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,718
I know.

93
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,508
There was nothing for Chao An to do.

94
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,352
Don`t worry.

95
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,351
I`ve talked to the factory manager.

96
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,829
I`ll take Chao An
to see him tomorrow.

97
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,388
Chiao Mei, go buy some food and wine.

98
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,158
We`re giving Uncle
a proper welcome tonight!

99
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,879
Right!

100
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,115
Thank you.

101
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,675
OK!

102
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,392
Remember, don`t talk too much.

103
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,671
Just answer whatever he asks.

104
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,476
Uncle is coming.

105
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,715
Come!

106
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,114
Come...

107
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,472
Uncle, everything is fine.

108
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,871
- I`m taking him to the manager.
- Thanks!

109
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,393
You folks stay and chat.

110
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,469
Uncle!

111
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,749
Here.

112
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,990
Father says
it`s an important shipment

113
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,076
and must be delivered immediately

114
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,628
Don`t worry it`ll be finished tonight

115
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,751
and delivered tomorrow.

116
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,876
Take care. I`m off.

117
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,358
Don`t work too hard.

118
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,069
Please.

119
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,431
See yourself out, won`t you?

120
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,509
Hsu Chien!

121
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,398
Is this your friend?

122
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,476
Yes, his name`s Cheng Chao An.

123
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,238
This is our factory manager.

124
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,275
Sir...

125
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,989
We need hardworking people.

126
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,072
Start him from tomorrow.

127
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,434
Right!

128
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,148
Come to work tomorrow.

129
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,634
Thank you!

130
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,074
Don`t mention it.

131
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,069
We`ll show you the town afterwards.

132
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,672
That looks like Mrs Ma.

133
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,679
Why are you crying?

134
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,478
Did someone try to bully you?

135
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,120
Tell me who and I`d deal with it!

136
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,959
Where`s your husband?

137
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,477
We`re broke and he`s gambling.

138
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,910
I`ll go in and have a look.

139
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,150
Ma, have you lost everything?

140
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,117
Lend me some money?

141
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,476
Still want to gamble? Look!

142
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,873
Banker wins!

143
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,473
Banker wins!

144
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,994
What are you doing?

145
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,353
What a hand!

146
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,714
Loaded dice?

147
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,759
Forget it, nobody forced you
to come here.

148
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,639
Don`t be a sore loser. Come on.

149
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,430
Try to cut down on your gambling.

150
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,956
Here`s $200. Take it as a loan.

151
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,993
But...

152
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,680
I`ve nowhere to spend money.

153
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,915
Pay me back when you can.

154
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,672
Thank you!

155
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,876
It`s cramped and the work is hard,

156
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,468
but the pay isn`t bad.

157
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,116
You can make enough in 5 years
to start a small business back home.

158
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,232
Hold it!

159
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,871
Please step aside.

160
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,594
Troublemakers!

161
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,875
Trying to run?

162
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,712
You`re a pain in the neck.

163
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,351
Only six of you?

164
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,636
Come on, let`s get it on!

165
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,629
Come on!

166
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,832
Get out of here!

167
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,596
You`re pretty good.

168
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,073
I learned some tricks back home.

169
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,358
Mother gave me this
to remind me not to fight.

170
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,793
Rise and shine, time for work!

171
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,713
Get up!

172
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,429
You`re safe with Hsu Chien around,

173
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,472
but he likes to fight bullies.

174
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,552
You might not be able
to control your temper.

175
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,672
Don`t worry,

176
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,873
I won`t fight.

177
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,592
I`ve Mother`s token to remind me.

178
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,915
All right then.

179
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,478
Take care. I`m off.

180
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,754
Goodbye, Uncle!

181
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,473
I`ve been doing all the talking.

182
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,352
Why don`t you say something?

183
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,155
Conversation leads to friendship.

184
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,876
Don`t be shy.

185
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,473
Why don`t you answer?

186
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,914
Don`t you hear me?

187
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,878
I`m talking to you!

188
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,112
Where do you live?

189
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,630
Let`s go on a date.

190
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,949
Let go!

191
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,680
Not until you answer me!

192
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,520
Cheng!

193
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,114
I`m off to work.

194
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,874
Cheng Chao An!

195
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,595
Here to start work?

196
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,711
Report to the foreman first.

197
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,393
Who`s the foreman?

198
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,317
The dark one.

199
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,549
Hurry up, be careful.

200
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,597
The short plump one.

201
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,639
What`s your job?

202
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,838
My name`s Cheng Chao An.

203
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:24,234
You`re the one Hsu Chien brought.

204
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,078
What took you so long?

205
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,031
All right, get to work.

206
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,628
Give them a hand.

207
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,633
Set it down carefully.

208
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,478
Push this across.

209
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,517
Don`t just stand there!

210
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,593
Get moving!

211
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,671
Do you want the job or not?

212
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,791
What am I supposed to do?

213
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,431
Help them move the ice.

214
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,078
Let me do it!

215
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,478
What is this?

216
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,038
None of your business!

217
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,798
- Damn!
- Sorry!

218
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,955
Stop!

219
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,555
What was that for?

220
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,594
He was careless and broke the ice.

221
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,869
He`s new here.

222
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,157
He can pay for the damage,
why hit him?

223
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,037
Why did you hit him?

224
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,599
Why`d you use violence?

225
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,671
Shut up! Get back to work!

226
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,713
Forget it!

227
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,712
It`s not worth it.

228
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,030
Are you done?

229
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,596
I`m hungry.

230
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,875
My treat.

231
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,153
Let`s go.

232
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,640
Wait, you two.

233
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,917
- What is it?
- The factory manager wants you.

234
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,479
OK.

235
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,629
Time to eat.

236
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,713
Wait, Wang and Chang aren`t back.

237
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,154
Never mind.

238
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,437
I heard the foreman say
the factory manager wanted them.

239
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,033
The manager?

240
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,714
- What for?
- I don`t know.

241
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,677
OK, but leave enough for them.

242
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,871
Pass it over.

243
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,109
Thanks!

244
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,034
Sit down!

245
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,519
OK.

246
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,035
Now, let`s have a serious talk.

247
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,352
Here`s $2,000 for you.

248
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,795
What for?

249
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,479
Listen.

250
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,599
We came so far to work here
to earn more money.

251
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,910
Didn`t you two discover something

252
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,479
in the ice today?

253
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,555
Yes.

254
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,755
It`s heroin.

255
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,675
Heroin?

256
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,475
C`mon! How much
can an ice factory make?

257
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,598
There are more profitable businesses.

258
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,677
Since you know
we`re prepared to cut you in.

259
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,515
We`re in this together now.

260
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,751
When we left home,

261
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,912
Father told us to work hard,

262
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,355
but to stay away from crime.

263
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,150
I`m trying to help you.

264
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,436
The $2,000...

265
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,751
We don`t want it.

266
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,990
I won`t force you,

267
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,157
but please don`t tell anyone.

268
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,080
Don`t worry.

269
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,915
I trust you.

270
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,869
We`re off.

271
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,473
OK.

272
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,878
Goodbye.

273
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,559
Wait until Hsu Chien
hears about this...

274
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,476
Hurry.

275
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,799
Have Wang and Chang arrived?

276
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,029
No.

277
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,798
Get to work.

278
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,397
- Didn`t the manager send for them?
- Yes.

279
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,596
Why didn`t they return last night?

280
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,392
How should I know?

281
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,118
Is the manager in?

282
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,428
Yes.

283
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,954
Sir!

284
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,353
Chang and Wang didn`t return.

285
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,431
Do you know where they are?

286
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,798
Why ask me?

287
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,878
The foreman said you sent for them.

288
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,996
The boss telephoned yesterday

289
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,997
and asked for them.

290
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,795
What for?

291
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,837
I don`t know.

292
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,959
Strange.

293
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,868
I don`t believe it!

294
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,470
You can go
to the boss` place and see.

295
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,790
Old Wang disappeared two months ago.

296
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,797
Wang didn`t disappear.

297
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,480
He went home to find a wife.

298
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,592
All right, get to work.

299
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,075
They might turn up at any time.

300
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,473
Any news?

301
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,397
What did the manager say?

302
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,431
He said the boss sent for them.

303
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,993
If they`re not back soon

304
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,872
I`ll go there after work.

305
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,353
- Alone?
- Why not?

306
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,635
I`ll go, too.

307
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,869
Don`t move!

308
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,110
Step back, just watch me!

309
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,869
Come on.

310
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,480
See? That`s the way to do it.

311
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,871
Nobody can get near you.

312
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,439
Fine.

313
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,036
Remember that move for next time.

314
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,388
Yes.

315
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,159
Father, let me have $2,000.

316
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,471
What, broke again?

317
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,675
I need the money for a reason.

318
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,519
You know you like to have
a new woman every year?

319
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,914
I`ve found one for you.

320
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,399
Really?

321
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,831
Tall, slim pretty and educated.

322
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,076
Not like those dumb chicks.

323
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,669
Where is she?

324
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,070
I`ll get her for you for $2,000.

325
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,957
That`s blackmail.

326
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,039
Let`s have it!

327
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,756
Sir, two workmen are here to see you.

328
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,078
I`ll see them inside.

329
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,836
You take a rest.

330
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,473
I`ll be right back.

331
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,671
This way!

332
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,513
This is the boss.

333
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,469
Sir!

334
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,155
- You go out first.
- Yes.

335
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,158
What is it?

336
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,635
Two of our colleagues

337
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,591
were called here last night.

338
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,751
Yes.

339
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,071
Chang and Wang work hard.

340
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,675
I sent for them to reward them.

341
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,990
I`m also promoting them.

342
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,873
Do you know
they haven`t returned?

343
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,868
Yes, I`ve informed the police.

344
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,434
They`ll be found.

345
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,989
You said that with Old Wang.

346
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,953
It`s been over a month now.

347
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,678
What can I do?

348
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,673
You workers eat drink and gamble -

349
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,398
you do whatever you feel like.

350
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,399
They`ve got legs.
How can I tell them where to go?

351
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,871
They aren`t like that!

352
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,156
You needn`t lose your temper.

353
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,638
You`re not their next of kin.

354
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,148
Be smart!

355
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,995
If you play your cards right.

356
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,509
I`ll see you`re rewarded.

357
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,351
I don`t understand.

358
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,713
I`ll make it clear.

359
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,156
Don`t meddle in my affairs
and I`ll make you rich.

360
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,672
What? So you admit
something happened to them?

361
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,028
I didn`t say that.

362
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,718
Hand them over!

363
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,069
Otherwise I`ll report you!

364
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,555
Say what you like.

365
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,676
You got no evidence.

366
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,070
Don`t think you can bully us!

367
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,475
- Hand over our men today!
- No.

368
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,039
I`ll charge you with murder!

369
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,478
Hsu!

370
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,589
Lao Erh!

371
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,353
It`s 12:30,

372
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,039
time to sleep.

373
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,752
Hurry up and come to bed!

374
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,875
Hurry up!

375
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,919
The lane is deserted.

376
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,469
We`ll wait till tomorrow.

377
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,034
Go.

378
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,151
Don`t cry, Hsu is all right.

379
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,913
Go to bed.

380
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,872
Brother Hsu isn`t back yet.

381
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,758
We`re worrying about it.

382
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,911
Something may have happened.

383
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,275
Chao An, you know the pier?

384
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,876
There`s a shop there
where Hsu often goes to play chess.

385
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,315
Go and see if he`s been there.

386
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,474
Ah San!

387
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,911
Go to the gambling den and watch
for anything suspicious.

388
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,877
- OK.
- Hurry!

389
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,558
I`ll go and poke around,

390
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,835
You go to Ma`s place.

391
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,154
Ask him to help.

392
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,389
OK, I`ll go.

393
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,393
Chiao Mei, stay here.

394
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,829
If he returns, come to the factory.

395
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,996
Has Hsu been here?

396
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,032
No, not for some time.

397
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,751
Did you see Brother Hsu?

398
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,075
Which Brother Hsu?

399
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,954
The one who was in the fight.

400
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,035
Thanks!

401
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,672
Have Hsu and Pi returned yet?

402
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,474
No, everyone`s waiting.

403
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,391
What to do?

404
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,519
Ask the manager to call the boss
and see if there`s any news.

405
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,068
I`ve called the boss.

406
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,759
- What did he say?
- Anything on Brother Hsu?

407
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,910
And the other two who disappeared?

408
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,992
He said Hsu and Pi went to his home,

409
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,111
but they left soon afterwards.

410
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,072
As to the other two,

411
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,470
the boss has informed the police.

412
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,033
They`ll look into the case.

413
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,111
They went to the boss` place.

414
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,470
He must know what happened to them.

415
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,676
Right!
Tell him to hand them over!

416
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,438
That`s right!

417
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,393
You`re being unreasonable.

418
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,318
You people gamble
and womanise all day.

419
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,712
Nobody can tell you what to do.
They may have gone to Bangkok.

420
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,269
No, Hsu doesn`t gamble.

421
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,395
He`s our leader.

422
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,476
He`d tell us if he were going.

423
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,234
You hand him over, or else!

424
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,153
Hand them over!
Hand them over!

425
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,393
What`s the use of pressuring me?
How should I know where they went?

426
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,389
We don`t care what you say.

427
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,478
Hand them over or we won`t work.

428
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,628
We`ll strike
until you hand them over.

429
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,557
Quiet, it`s no use shouting!

430
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,759
Get back to work.
We`ll talk it over tomorrow.

431
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,957
No way. Stop, hand them over.

432
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,471
What?

433
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,191
What?

434
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,635
Hurry up!

435
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,318
If Hsu doesn`t come back,

436
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,595
we won`t work.

437
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,109
We`ll strike.

438
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,469
What`s going on?

439
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,388
- Start work.
- All right, you needn`t get violent.

440
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,155
You hit me!

441
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,470
Why did you hit him?

442
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,116
I`ll beat you!

443
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,868
Get me 336.

444
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,075
Boss, we`ve got trouble!

445
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,432
Cheung, don`t just stand there.

446
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,999
Fight!

447
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,677
Where did they come from?

448
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,348
Stop!

449
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,959
Stop!

450
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,639
It`s all a misunderstanding.

451
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,792
It`s none of your concern.

452
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,910
If you want to fight, fight me!

453
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,634
Chao An is pretty tough.

454
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,875
Come on!

455
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,195
Come on!

456
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,874
Come, you dare?

457
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,149
Go.

458
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,716
What`s keeping you?

459
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,668
Get out!

460
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,832
Good work!

461
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,076
Chao An, nice moves!

462
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,748
Cheng Chao An.

463
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,958
Come up to my office.

464
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,551
Why did the manager want Chao An?

465
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,358
Will he try something?

466
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,434
If the manager
tries to rough up Chao An

467
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,788
we`ll fight!

468
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,354
Go.

469
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,636
- Shall we go and have a look?
- No. He won`t dare hurt Chao An.

470
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,434
Let`s wait here.

471
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,393
Take a rest.
Come on, let`s take a rest.

472
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,074
What`s going on?

473
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,434
Go take a look.

474
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,669
Right!

475
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,716
Look, what`s on it?

476
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,829
Cheng Chao An...

477
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,757
is promoted to foreman!

478
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,478
Really?

479
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,073
What about Ah Sheng?

480
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,113
He`s demoted to third class!

481
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,509
Now that`s what I call fair play!

482
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,875
Now Chao An is our chief,

483
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,917
he`s our big brother from home.

484
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,593
Yes.

485
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,555
Hey!

486
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,119
You deserved it!

487
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,632
Here comes our big brother!

488
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,870
Big brother...

489
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,350
One, two, three, four...

490
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,593
One, two, three, four...

491
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,758
Brother.

492
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,150
Follow us.

493
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,870
Halt!

494
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,469
- Dismiss...
- At ease

495
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,750
Ah Kun, why are you so happy?

496
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,354
Don`t you know?

497
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,592
Cheng Chao An is now a foreman.

498
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,878
How come?

499
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,315
The manager says he`s able and just.

500
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,799
Able and just?

501
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,677
What happened?

502
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,752
We had a fight with foreman Sheng.

503
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,071
He slapped me and Ah San fought him.

504
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,272
He called over ten men to beat us up.

505
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,079
Cheng Chao An suddenly stepped in.

506
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,474
He`s quick and skilled.

507
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:36,395
He floored all of them.

508
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,876
The manager promoted him.

509
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,428
- Why did you fight a foreman?
- He tried to make us work.

510
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,596
He hit me and the fight started.

511
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,429
- Why did you refuse to work?
- It was because of Hsu.

512
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,671
We asked for our four men back
and refused to start work otherwise.

513
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,116
What about Hsu?

514
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,390
What fun! Another fight!

515
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,120
There`s still no news of Hsu.

516
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,030
Don`t cry.

517
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,436
I`ll talk to the manager tomorrow.

518
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,030
If he won`t hand them over
I`ll show him no mercy!

519
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,558
- Well?
- He`s reported it to the police.

520
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,711
If they don`t return today

521
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,508
come to the station with me.

522
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,472
All right...

523
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,430
Let`s start work.

524
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,711
Time to eat.

525
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,073
I`m so hungry.

526
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,870
Wait!

527
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,837
Chao An went to the police station
and hasn`t come back.

528
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,110
We should wait for him.

529
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,591
Let`s wait awhile.

530
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,478
Sit down!

531
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,512
The boss said he couldn`t come.

532
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,478
He`s having dinner
with the police chief.

533
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,877
Any news of Hsu?

534
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:18,755
Don`t worry
the chief is the boss` good friend.

535
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:23,471
They`ll do everything to find him.
We`ll be notified once he`s found.

536
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,430
- Come, let`s eat
- OK

537
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,788
Manager!

538
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,997
They`re coming! Come in.

539
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,549
Come in and sit down.

540
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,874
Please sit.

541
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,875
Let me introduce you.

542
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,719
This is Wu Man.

543
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,037
This is Sting Hsiang.

544
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,838
This is Rose.

545
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,828
Our foreman, Cheng Chao An.

546
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,473
Good.

547
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,670
I`ll drink to your health.

548
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,354
Right!

549
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,954
Mr Cheng I return your toast!

550
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,429
You`re a good drinker.

551
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,790
You`re a good drinker.

552
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,310
Let this dinner
make peace between us.

553
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,472
We`re all colleagues.

554
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,876
You have a bright future, Chao An.

555
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,319
Thank you!

556
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,834
Bottoms up!

557
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,713
Come on, let`s eat!

558
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,472
One, two, three...

559
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,236
Good!

560
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,030
Boards don`t hit back...

561
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,511
Good...

562
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:17,713
Come...this way.

563
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,073
Still waiting?

564
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,068
Go to bed don`t catch cold.

565
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,075
Ah Kun, I`m afraid.

566
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,435
What for?

567
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,472
Five people who lived here
have disappeared.

568
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,398
Maybe Cheng is also...

569
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,670
Don`t make wild guesses.

570
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,109
He`ll be all right.

571
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,953
I`m worried.

572
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,672
Oh, well...

573
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,598
Stop crying!

574
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,711
I know you like him.

575
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,718
But, really,
we don`t know much about him.

576
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,475
He`s young, don`t worry about him.
We don`t know what he`s up to.

577
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,353
Leaving so early?

578
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,793
Sorry.

579
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,994
Where could Chao An have gone?

580
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,712
I wonder!

581
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:20,078
He`s coming!

582
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,597
Chao An! Why didn`t you come back
last night?

583
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:25,869
Where did you go?

584
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,679
We were worried sick!

585
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,829
What did the police say?

586
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,828
The police?

587
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:35,915
I didn`t go.

588
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,071
Didn`t go? Why not?

589
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,912
- Where did you go, then?
- The manager asked me to dinner.

590
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,399
Dinner?

591
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,877
So you forgot about Hsu?

592
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,429
Don`t forget how you got this job.

593
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,748
- Listen to me
- Go.

594
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,629
- You forgot all about it!
- Wait!

595
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,633
Come on!

596
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,875
What`s the rush?

597
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,879
One dinner and you get
a swollen head.

598
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:32,352
Just because you know the manager.

599
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:34,909
Go on! Suck up to him.

600
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:38,277
I work for my keep.

601
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,634
Yeah.

602
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,072
- Sir!
- Who is it?

603
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,039
Cheng Chao An.

604
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:50,955
What is it?

605
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,832
There`s no word on Hsu.

606
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,791
The workers are all worried.

607
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,988
I`d like to see the boss.

608
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,473
All right.

609
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:05,679
I`ll call him
You can go after work.

610
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,672
All right.

611
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:13,914
Hsiao Chun!

612
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:27,950
- What is it?
- There`s a man coming to see me.

613
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,797
- We`ll have to put on a show.
- A show?

614
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,995
- Who are you?
- A foreman from the factory.

615
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,588
- What`s your name?
- Cheng Chao An.

616
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,876
You may go in.

617
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,359
Don`t bite!

618
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,549
Come!

619
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:07,909
Boss!

620
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,516
- Are you foreman Cheng?
- Yes.

621
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:14,349
Chang called me about your visit.
Come inside.

622
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,638
Sit down!

623
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,755
Be seated.

624
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,676
I know why you came.

625
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,160
Is it about Hsu Chien?

626
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,676
Idiot, don`t be so careless!

627
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,399
Sorry.

628
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,752
I`m very unhappy.

629
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,760
I`ve lost a lot, too.

630
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,035
How so?

631
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,870
I`ve been here so many years.

632
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,436
Many people envy my success.

633
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,353
They`re using this opportunity
to attack me.

634
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,592
You`ll hear a lot of rumours
about me.

635
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,109
Don`t believe them.

636
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,477
I treat the workers as my children.

637
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,672
I advise them to be economical.

638
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:14,072
We all came from faraway places.

639
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,790
We work hard and should save up.

640
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:24,673
Listen, I know you`re capable.

641
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:27,070
Thank you, but about them...

642
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,711
Don`t worry, I`ve told the police.

643
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,394
They`ll find them.

644
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:33,913
Father!

645
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:40,038
We looked everywhere, no trace.

646
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,156
Idiot! Fooling about outside all day.

647
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,671
You can`t even do one small errand!
Why are you home so early?

648
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,389
It`s almost dark.

649
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,790
You`ll look again tomorrow.

650
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,229
Don`t come home
if you don`t find them!

651
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,874
I`ll be going.

652
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,629
Fine. Ask them not to worry.

653
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:05,877
I`ll do everything I can.

654
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,109
OK.

655
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,468
We got away with it for now.

656
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,075
We must take care of the factory.

657
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,636
Nothing must go wrong.

658
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:27,320
Cheng is not a simple guy.

659
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,835
- Keep a close eye on that fellow.
- Yes.

660
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,031
Father! Come.

661
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,758
I`ve found where the girl is.

662
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,031
She`s a beauty!

663
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:46,119
I`ll get hold of her tonight!

664
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,598
I`m looking forward to it!

665
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,515
Hi.

666
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,351
Haven`t eaten yet?

667
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,749
Thank you!

668
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,439
What?

669
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,313
The boss kept you for dinner?

670
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,519
No.

671
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,839
What did he say?

672
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,792
That he`d told the police?

673
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,997
And they`ll let us know
if they`re found?

674
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,717
Rubbish!

675
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:29,112
A foreman eating cold rice?

676
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,397
That`s tough!

677
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:49,156
Yes, a foreman

678
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,592
isn`t used to such economical living.

679
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,519
Ah Kun, why say that?

680
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,829
Say what?

681
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,757
I don`t like him.

682
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:16,515
We`d best keep away from him.

683
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,433
It`s no use treating him so well.

684
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,358
We`ll tell him to go
after Hsu returns.

685
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,435
Ah Kun is a good man but impulsive.

686
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,788
Don`t be angry.

687
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,598
I won`t.

688
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,674
They don`t understand me.

689
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,993
In time, they will. Be patient.

690
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,075
I`m going to work.
You better go home.

691
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,633
Mr Cheng.

692
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,592
Where are you going?

693
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,670
Since you`re here, sit down.

694
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,594
Come.

695
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,399
Sit.

696
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,640
What`s making you unhappy?

697
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,871
Some workers disappeared.

698
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:37,872
There`s been no news of them.

699
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,594
You must be careful.

700
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,473
Your boss is tricky.

701
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:50,072
Think about it:
how much can an ice factory make?

702
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,834
Do you know how he made his fortune?

703
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,755
How?

704
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,150
There`s something in the ice.

705
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,075
- How do you know?
- I was their maid.

706
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,748
Look!

707
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,597
He did this to me.

708
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,955
I knew you`d come here.

709
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,633
What have you been up to?

710
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,151
So what?

711
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,069
Now you know the truth.

712
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,750
You think we`ll let you leave alive?

713
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,118
Get him!

714
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:31,989
Go!

715
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,789
Chiao Mei!

716
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,869
Chiao Mei!

717
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,598
Chiao Mei!

718
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:16,433
Chiao Mei!

719
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,148
Chiao Mei!

720
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:26,153
Chiao Mei!

721
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,515
Chiao Mei!

722
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,879
Chiao Mei!

723
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,870
Chiao Mei. Chiao Mei!

724
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,875
Mother gave me a jade talisman

725
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,679
and told me not
to get into trouble,

726
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,789
but now all this...
What am I to do?

727
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:10,872
If anything should happen to me,
what should she do?

728
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,877
She`s over 70.

729
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,990
Should I just return home?

730
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:27,917
Those people have been so nice to me
since I came here.

731
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:31,755
Each of them was a nice person.

732
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:35,753
They took me into their family.
Now they`ve died so horribly.

733
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:40,915
I`ll settle the score!

734
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:46,032
I must take revenge!

735
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,110
The young master didn`t return.

736
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:47,000
Go and find him, then call me.

737
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:48,513
Yes.

738
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,631
It`s none of your business.

739
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,153
Go away!

740
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,836
Just keep away. Go on.

741
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:00,076
It`s not your fight.

742
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,392
Come out!

743
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,913
The boss and the foreman
are fighting.

744
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,149
Run!

745
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:06,555
Why should you save me?

746
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:09,553
Never mind, run!

747
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,632
