1
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,500
Left! 3rd!

2
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,540
Jean-Louis Schlesser
in his mean machine,

3
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,100
No. 10,
10, like Zidane

4
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,900
30 meter, left Brake!

5
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,340
World rally champion in '98 and '99.

6
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,860
winner of the Paris - Dakar:
the man to beat!

7
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,260
Left, top speed!

8
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,620
Get a move on!
We'll get slaughtered!

9
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,580
I'm flat out!

10
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,420
The guy behind's flatter out!
Watch out!

11
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,740
He's flashing me!
Isn't that Vatanen?

12
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,300
No, a taxi!

13
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,780
Move your crate!
I'm working here!

14
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,060
-Is it the right road?
-Short cut!

15
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,740
Short cut...

16
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,700
-Don't let a taxi win!
-No way!

17
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,700
Sorry, folks.
A tourist's blocking the road!

18
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,900
It looks more like a race car.

19
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,820
It's just a clown in a "babe magnet"!

20
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,900
A taxi on our tail sure looks bad!

21
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,460
I'll shake him now!

22
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,260
He rammed me!

23
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,860
Enough! We'll be here all week!

24
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,060
Nearly there, lady.

25
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,660
Why...why are there so many people here?

26
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,540
They're on vacation.

27
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,540
Oh, right!

28
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,340
C'mon. Jean-Louis!Bravo, Jean Louis!

29
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,740
No. 10...
It's not Schlesser!

30
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,180
A taxi...

31
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,420
I didn't catch his number...

32
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,780
17 min., 25 sec!

33
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,220
People always throw up after!
Never during

34
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,540
Ok, lady?

35
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,740
-Who's it for?

36
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,420
Her! Her water broke!

37
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,100
-You're giving birth!
Well, I ain't knitting!

38
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,820
Get the gear! We'll do it here!

39
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,180
Hey doc. I gotta run.
Use the ground, not my seat!

40
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,220
Water's broken!

41
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,900
Water breaks!

42
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,060
Push!

43
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,700
Breathe! Push!

44
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,700
Hi, Lilly

45
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,940
30 minutes late
for lunch with my folks!

46
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,620
Yeah, I'm on my way.

47
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,900
Daniel, you're finally meeting my Dad!

48
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,900
He's expecting you!

49
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,700
This is a super-big emergency!
Top-octan!

50
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,340
What are my folks? Diesel?

51
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,900
Lilly, come on!

52
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,460
Mom's edgy. Dad's pacing the floor.
But hey, take your time!

53
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,740
I can't help it
I'm stuck tight here!

54
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,460
"Stuck"?
Who's yelling?

55
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,460
It's... a woman.

56
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,340
Thanks!
I guesssed that much!

57
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,540
I'm just watching.
It's not what you think. you hear me?

58
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,700
I can hear that bitch!

59
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,700
Is it someone I know?

60
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,460
No! I don't know her either!
I just met her!

61
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,700
Oh, I feel it now! I feel it!

62
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,980
Don't fuck with me!

63
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,140
You got some slut there
while I wait for you!

64
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,300
No! This big woman's yelling 'cause her water snapped!
Her husband's here.

65
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,220
Husband, too? A threesome in a car?

66
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,580
Oh, no! Someone tell her!

67
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,500
I don't know I can. Here. This is your fault.

68
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,500
I'm the husband.
-It's marvelous!
-Push

69
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,780
Listen to me
Daniel. he's dead meat!

70
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,420
He's all shook up, that's all.

71
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,460
Want to talk to the doctor?
A doctor, too!

72
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,900
Lilly, I swear it's the truth!

73
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,300
The baby's coming out.
Push!

74
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,820
It's a baby. I swear!

75
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,500
Baby?

76
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,380
I see the head! I think it's a head!

77
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,180
Your baby?
No it's not!

78
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,780
He's nothing like me, I swear!
He's as wrinkly as an old garden gnome!

79
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,700
Marvelous!
It's marvelous.

80
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,700
You're messing me about?
Just listen!

81
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:23,540
This woman... a boy just gave birth.
Outside the clinic, in my taxi

82
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,500
She's ruined my back seat!

83
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,860
Don's hit that poor kid!
I can't hear a thing now!

84
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,500
Marvelous!

85
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,140
You be there when I give birth!

86
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,700
I can sit and wait if you like.
This place looks fine.

87
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,500
You got 10 minutes!

88
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,420
Not twins? Is it a wrap?
No offense, but I gotta run!

89
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,700
Ah, hon! Problem with your friend?

90
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,220
An emergency at the hospital.
A difficult birth.

91
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,380
I understand. Saving lives all day.
I respect that.

92
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,300
I don't know what to say.
You were wonderful!

93
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,540
I know!

94
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,940
I hope you won't lose your license.

95
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,660
I don't have one!

96
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,460
I am quite pleased...
moved, even...

97
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,820
to give you... first...

98
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,060
driver's... license!

99
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,220
-You sure?
-Yup!

100
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,580
I don't want to twist your arm.

101
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,780
No doubt about it

102
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,740
It's just fine!
It's not'cause it's my 27th time?

103
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,820
Your 100th time would be the same!

104
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,140
You're ready... really ready.

105
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,580
-Ok, I accept.
-That's fine.

106
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,660
-I'll beck out.
-No!

107
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,380
Leave it!
Don't touch! Leave it!

108
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,660
-I'll do it! I'll sort it out!
We'll sort it out!

109
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,020
Don't I have my license?

110
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,820
Yes, you do!

111
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,100
But don't go to extremes.
Take it smoothly.

112
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:22,260
Your license is in your hand.
Now you go home... on foot! See?

113
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,140
I see.
I'll call tomorrow in case you regret it.

114
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,860
No! I won't be around
nor the following days.

115
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,060
I got transferred to Paris.

116
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,140
This is a leaving present?

117
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,300
For my most regular pupil!

118
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,500
Yeah, right... "Regular"

119
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,940
Car Weekly, Please.

120
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,900
That's ok. My pleasure!

121
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,380
Mom, he's here! Mom!

122
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,620
Yes, of course! Let's eat!

123
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,900
Sorry, it won't happen again.

124
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,220
Not if you screw this up! There won't be a next time.
My dad's real strict.

125
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,260
Oh, come on.
deep down, he must be nice.

126
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,340
His daughter's eyes are so blue!

127
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,540
You just be careful!

128
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,020
Don't worry. It'll be ok.
I know I'll like him, so he'll like me!

129
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,580
-Is he a cop?
-No!

130
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,980
Ok, then!
Ain't nothing worse than a cop!

131
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,340
Dad? I'd like you
meet my boyfriend, Daniel.

132
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,340
You're a doctor?

133
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,900
Go on... knock him dead!

134
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,300
Pleased to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

135
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,260
Are you deaf or won't you answer?

136
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,380
I'm not a doctor...
I'm an apprentice!

137
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,380
What year?

138
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,980
1st... I mean
I'm about to change into 2nd.

139
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,220
2nd year?

140
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,300
-You're not young.
-Edmond!

141
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,460
What? I'm just inspecting
a new recruit. Answer!

142
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,220
Sir, I'm not young
but I've done lots of jobs

143
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,220
to feed my family
and pay my licens... studies.

144
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,100
I started when I was 12
so I've aged.

145
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,780
What jobs?

146
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,900
I drive a taxi... ambulance. Ambulance!

147
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,180
I got delayed at the clinic.

148
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,940
It lets me keep my hand in.
Eye on the road, eye on the patient.

149
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,100
2 things at once?
You make mistakes!

150
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:05,340
Excuse me, sir, but I disagree.
Just look at you.

151
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,780
Oh? What do you mean?

152
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,580
I see a lot of decorations there

153
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,580
proving you've had a successful career.

154
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,660
I see Lilly pretty,
intelligent, well-educated.

155
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,820
You clearly managed
to do 2 things at once.

156
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,980
I drove an ambulance, too.
in '59, in Algeria.

157
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,380
Eye on the road,
eye on the machine gun!

158
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,700
See to the injured later
if they're still alive!

159
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,060
Edmont? I'd like to see to my roast beef!
Before it burns.

160
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,140
Affirmative! I'm starving! Forward!

161
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,700
Now, the endurance test:
3 hours of war stories!

162
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,660
I'll slip into neutral
and cruise through!

163
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,300
-I hurt you?
-Not at all.

164
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,580
Good. I heard your hip crack.

165
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,020
-It's mine!
-Let's stop.

166
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,580
I'm fine!

167
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,780
I don't want to hurt you
but I'll be Ok.

168
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,980
I'm Ok now.

169
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,220
I could've massaged it for you..
but if you're Ok... fine!

170
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,300
The surface pain's gone,

171
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,060
but deep down, there's nagging pain,
stiffness.

172
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,260
Maybe a little massage would ease it.

173
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,700
Ok, guys, a match to finish,
for 5 minutes.

174
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,580
Bow!

175
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,460
-Change partners?
-No.

176
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,140
Go!
I really don't want to hurt you.

177
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,020
I'm touched by your concern. Emilien.

178
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,980
Really?

179
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,740
Now I warn you. I started, aged 4.
I can teach you a thing or two!

180
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,420
Your smile could melt a radiator!
You put me off!

181
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,780
Real opponents don't smile!
It's not fair!

182
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,220
Listen up,
you sumos!

183
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,940
Meeting with the boss in 5 minutes!

184
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,420
What's up? You lost your lense?

185
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,780
I can see you well enough
to kick your ass!

186
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,540
Just trying to help!

187
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,820
You done much judo?

188
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,140
No, only a couple of times.
It's not my sport.

189
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,180
-So, what is?
-Karate.

190
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,300
Far more effective!

191
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,820
Mine's ping pong. No good in fights,
same principle:

192
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,060
Spirit of Rising Sun!

193
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,180
Con-nichon-a!

194
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,380
It's easy. "Con"...
"consummate idiot" like Emilien!

195
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Thanks!
Then, "ninny" like...

196
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,220
Sorry, Petra.
it's just an example.

197
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,580
And "a" as in "aaaa"!

198
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,820
Now, you.
Con-nichon-a!

199
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,380
Not bad.

200
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,460
-What's it mean?
-"It means "hello" in Japanese.

201
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,980
And don't forget it.
In under an hour, in o" Marseille,

202
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,380
We greet Japan's Defense Secretary

203
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,860
Mr Tefu... Temuchila...

204
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,100
Mr Tef... Tejus.. just call him Nip!
The Nip's from Tokyo.

205
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,620
Before the Franco-Japanese
summit after bastille Day in Paris

206
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,820
he's visiting our charming town.
Know why?

207
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,460
-The climate?
-The sights?

208
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,620
-Sure.
-The food?

209
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,260
-The Pastis?
-The soccer match!

210
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,180
You're a big bunch of nerds!

211
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,100
Our anti-gang training base!

212
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,420
Con-nichon-a!

213
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,780
The Japs have a problem
with Jacuzzi... Yakuza

214
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,180
who are even kidnapping
members of government.

215
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,500
The Defense Secretary
visited England, Germany and France.

216
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,500
Let's get one thing clear:

217
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,660
the Krauts and Limeys
mustn't win the contract.

218
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,820
Let's make this World Cup II!

219
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,260
I put together a detailed operation

220
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,740
which I will now explain.
I called it...

221
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,340
-Operation

222
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,820
-Ninja!

223
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,780
He's got no more ammo!

224
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,580
Suddenly... no more ammo!

225
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,380
Well, that's only natural.

226
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,340
Yeah, only natural.

227
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,940
I turn to Raymond.
Here it is.

228
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,660
I shake him.

229
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,700
"Raymond, your ammo!"
I say. No answer!

230
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,300
I shake him again.
Then...

231
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,780
he falls sideways. Dead!

232
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,020
-Terrible!
-My whole unit!

233
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,820
I'm alone.
Armored car's on fire

234
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,860
radio's out...
My flask's half-empty!

235
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,380
Oh, no! So, then what?

236
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,660
-I prayed!
-Well done!

237
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,660
That's all I could do.
Only a miracle'd save me!

238
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,740
A miracle! We're saved!

239
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,540
No! Now what? Get that, hon.
I'm in battle!

240
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,980
Edmont, the red phone!

241
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,500
The red phone?
Excuse me.

242
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,380
General Bertineau speaking.

243
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,180
It's you. Bertrand on the red phone?

244
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,180
Well done, Daniel.
You'll get dessert!

245
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,740
My god! I completely forgot!

246
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,700
No problem! I'll be there!
Catastrophe!

247
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,380
We'll wait.
I'll be 1 hour!

248
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,860
-I want you right now.
-Give me 20 seconds!

249
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,380
The airport, fast!

250
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,900
That's kind a long!

251
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,220
Catastrophe!

252
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,300
Dad!

253
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,540
You OK? You hurt?

254
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,180
Catastrophe!

255
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,780
She won't go so good now!

256
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,900
In 15 minutes I'm to greet
Japan's Defense Secretary.

257
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,460
Catastrophe!
I'll get you there in time.

258
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,180
15 minutes. Impossible!

259
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,860
Try me, sir!

260
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,780
Seatbelt, please. Dad.

261
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,740
Is this your ambulance?
No, a taxi.

262
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,580
My brother loaned it to me.

263
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,220
Save me some dessert.
You can have seconds!

264
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,460
-Let's go.
-Sure!

265
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,260
We're crawling 'cause of these tires
but they'll soon warm up!

266
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,660
Don't overheat!
Now look, kid.

267
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,580
This is the new

268
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,140
Cortex 500.
The Rolls Royce of speed traps!

269
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,540
Turn it on. Instant read out.

270
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,860
Go to the roadside.

271
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,220
Put your arm out slightly.

272
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,860
You better learn on the old model.

273
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,100
-We're on the highway?
-Now I can step on it!

274
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,260
You must like hospitals!

275
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,780
Catastrophe!

276
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,260
Chief! We got one!

277
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,420
A biggie!

278
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,020
-306?

279
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,940
I think it was a 406.
And not factory-fresh!

280
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,900
306 km/h, moron!
Tell the others!

281
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,220
A white taxi at 306 km/t, I repeat...

282
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,260
-306 km/h!
-Yup, 306!

283
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,820
We'll get him!

284
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,260
You Ok, sir?

285
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,380
It's him! I must get there!

286
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,260
Change of tactics!

287
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,220
-What? This isn't it!
-It's short cut!

288
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,780
Hold on!

289
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,340
I have a UFO on Runway 1!

290
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,300
Yield to aircraft. We have just landed.
Outside temperature: 35 degrees.

291
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,980
We hope you enjoed flying with us!

292
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,580
Excuse me, Captain, a taxi's coming.

293
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,340
I can't hear over the noise!

294
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,020
I repeat: taxi approaching.

295
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,500
-I never ordered a taxi. Did you?
-No, but I know him.

296
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,580
-14 minutes 30!
-Great!

297
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,020
Bertineau, why the taxi?

298
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,020
We lost a car.
This guy saved my life.

299
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,780
Con-nichon-a!

300
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,860
Konichiwa!

301
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,900
-What? What you said.
- God help me.

302
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,660
Thank you for greeting me in japanese.
Me, Gibert protect you during your vacation... uh, stay.

303
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,660
Our Secretary. Say hi... This is he.

304
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,820
Dear fellow! I'm honored to meet you.

305
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:15,220
I'm a member of your security team.
We wish you...

306
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,340
a nice stay.
You speak very well.

307
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,260
A little. If I can help
in any way, just ask.

308
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,620
Pleased to meet you.

309
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:34,380
Only the blonde girl speaks Japanese.

310
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,740
I copy. Go back to base.

311
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,900
Let us offer a cocktail. This way.

312
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,940
-Does your file say you speak Japanese?
-It was embarrassing.

313
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,220
-Yes, it does. Below my measurements.
Guess I stopped there.

314
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,420
Do me a favor, son.

315
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,540
-See that taxi there?
-I sure do!

316
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,460
A taxi?
Love to, lady, but I'm busy.
Another time?

317
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,060
-Always in the right place!
-Know that guy?

318
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,660
Bertineau, head of the Med, Basin.

319
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,260
Lilly's dad!
No shit!

320
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,780
-I was there for lunch.
-Unbelievable!

321
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,500
-Yeah, I can't stand the army.
-You couldn't stand cops.

322
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,100
I still can't. I can stand you!

323
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,700
Don't know what you're worrying about.
Well, he seems to like you.

324
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,700
He wants you to come to the cocktail party.
Half cops, half soldiers? That's nightmare!

325
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,940
Prefer half mechanics, gas station attendants?
Come on.

326
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,740
The chat's the same:
cars, sport, chicks!

327
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,860
-You'll fit in fine.
-I'd be ashmed.

328
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,220
Listen... if Bertineau is Lilly's father

329
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,620
he could end up your father-in-law.

330
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,380
What will he think if you say no?

331
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,980
One drink, no more.

332
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,980
-"Martini"?
-My sister's name!

333
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,220
Come on. One for the road won't hurt you!

334
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,740
Domo arigato.

335
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,460
The gateau is good.
locally made. Next to the station.

336
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:48,060
Gibert.
Excuse me. I'll get you another.

337
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:52,340
Don't get him too stewed
to sign the contract.

338
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,860
No warries, I know what I'm doing.
Just softening him up.

339
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,060
He is nearly done!
Is your plan ready?

340
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,020
Sir, it's hearsed and rehearsed to death!

341
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:07,260
It's fine-tuned... to the second.

342
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,580
-You're not at all as I imagined.
-No offense, but...

343
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:21,140
A bright 2nd-year medical student...

344
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,940
I thought you'd be more...
Pimply?

345
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,060
Right... and a slower driver!

346
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,340
Yes, he's "fastest" doctor I know.

347
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:36,660
Well, I'm very grateful.
Gratefully indebted to you!

348
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,660
Ask me anything...
but Lilly's hand!

349
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,260
Course not!
I can't think of anything else.

350
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,060
Valid 1 year, parts and labor!

351
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,620
-Excuse me,
-Go ahead.

352
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,780
Emilien, start Operation Ninja.

353
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,500
-Petra, watch him.
-Watch me?

354
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,660
Friends with the cops?

355
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,580
No, only with one.

356
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,260
Good! It's rare.
Most youths are anti-cops

357
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,940
anti-army, anti-everithing!
They want to kill the father figure.

358
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,860
Sir, my patients are waiting.

359
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:19,780
Wait! 5 more minutes.
You'll find this very interesting.

360
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,060
-Selling the Japs Peugeot?
-Nothing's impossible!

361
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,940
This is a Cobra.

362
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:49,820
Specially designed protect
visiting dignitaries

363
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,540
Titanium-bodywork

364
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:55,140
The multiple side panels
can resist any bullet!

365
00:28:55,340 --> 00:29:00,220
Missile detectors, front and back!
Coating: Phantom!

366
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,540
Solid tires!
It's linked to the Atlas satellite

367
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,860
and if necessary, can piloted from HQ.

368
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,820
Now, the engine

369
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,500
Ninja!

370
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,540
Nice noise for a V12.

371
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,580
V12 engine, twin turbos.
Voice-activated!

372
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,620
Top speed: 336 km/h!

373
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,700
Range: 880 km. Paris-Marseille

374
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,580
2 airbags in front,
2 in back, 4 at the sides.

375
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,380
8 in all for maximum protection.

376
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,220
Ladies and gentlemen:
This car is like France:

377
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,940
indestructible!

378
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,060
Get him out!
That's just 'cause we set it to ultra-sensitive.

379
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,620
It's usually on "normal"!
Be careful!

380
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,180
See the balloons?

381
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,820
Useful against thieves!

382
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,620
Get him out! Hold on to his head.

383
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,500
Tell him not to worry.

384
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,180
He needs the bathroom.

385
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,700
-Bertrand, go with him.
-Yes, sir.

386
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,180
Get him out? Good.
It'll be good as new in no time.

387
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,780
Will he?
Now who'll drive it?

388
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,780
I have a young civilian driver.
He's very good.

389
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,660
I'll vouch for him.

390
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,740
Really?
Banco!

391
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:45,740
Before your tour of the town
I'll show you our latest computing innovation.

392
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,380
-Gimme that.
-Wear this.

393
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:01,500
It'll cramp my style.
Even a cretin with mitts on...

394
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,060
could drive this baby!
Take him away! No it's OK.

395
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,580
Told you!
Never mind.

396
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,660
No one'll see.
Go on! Ninja!

397
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,980
-How do you stop it?
-You just have to say "Nip".

398
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,100
Ninja!

399
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:28,020
The mission is simple. We prepared a demonstration...
Get it? With fake attacks!

400
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,820
Like the ghost train?
Yes, so as to impress the Nip,

401
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,260
Ninja!

402
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,860
Above all, don't worry.
Let things happen.

403
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,780
-If the Nip...
-Ninja!

404
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,940
-Don't play while I'm talking.
-Not me. You keep saying "Nip"!

405
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,740
Ninja!

406
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,980
-Great!
-Not bad.

407
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,500
Sir, we shall now escort you
to your hotel.

408
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,860
Get in!

409
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,860
-Konichiwa!
-Up shit creek again!

410
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,420
Forward!

411
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,980
They're here.

412
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,140
On this road.
It's going planned.

413
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,300
Very good, Katano.
Let me hear them.

414
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,500
Spring Roll
come in.

415
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,460
Hey, Emilien, come in!

416
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,140
-Do you hear me?
-Loud 'n' clear.

417
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,300
We just left.
1st trap. Be with you in 20 minutes.

418
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,660
OK.
20 minutes to warm up.

419
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,700
What about us?
What can we do for 20 minutes?

420
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,660
I don't know.

421
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,700
Any ideas?
Yeah, but 20 centimeters... minutes is too short!

422
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:35,060
Oh yeah? So, we need an idea,
we could start now and finish later

423
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,620
Yes, that'd work!

424
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,780
But... I too... have an idea,

425
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,500
I'm sure... you'll really like it.

426
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:51,300
-Oh yeah?
-It may be the same one.

427
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,180
That'd be marvelous!
It'd be ideal! Go on, you first.

428
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:03,500
Make the most of these few quiet moments...
to...

429
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,740
-learn Japanese!

430
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,660
It wasn't the same idea.
Right

431
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,460
He won't see much of Marseille.

432
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,980
Sorry, he's suffering from jetlag.

433
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,540
May I ask...
why your boss is here?

434
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:26,820
To sign very big contract
and see anti-gang method.

435
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,100
-He'll sure see that!
-You know method?

436
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,220
Sure I do!
1st, the suspect.

437
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:37,580
He is probably guilty.
A foreigner is doubly suspect!

438
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:43,260
There's the guilty.
Foreign, tanned suspect!

439
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:48,540
He's had it! If he's tanned
he just sun-bathes and does nothing all day.

440
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,340
He is a suspect! So, he's guilty.
Faultless logic!

441
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,580
-That boy any good?
-Very good.

442
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,060
A doctor, friend of my daughter's.

443
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,300
Something tells me
they're flirting.

444
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,900
Only natural at their age.
Quite.

445
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:07,700
To make the guilty party confess
they use questioning!

446
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,100
Simple!
They apply trilogy like Star Wars.

447
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,180
Episode 1: Beat him up!
Good, healthy exercise!

448
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,100
Episode 2: Tax'em to raise some cash
for the Christmas!

449
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,740
Episode 3: drink copiously!

450
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,900
I'm pleased youngsters
still respect our values.

451
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,500
-A good son-in-law.
-Think so?

452
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,340
Many French gangs?

453
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,340
The most dangerous are the heavy mob.
100,000-strong!

454
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,620
Easy to spot. Wears a whistle.
Always guzzling beer!

455
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,420
-Go toward the port.
-My pleasure, chief.

456
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,300
-He sounds very polite.
-Affirmative. Courteous, too.

457
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:55,100
Polite to your face...
shaft you from behind!

458
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,380
Like in the souk.
A big smile as they steal your cash!

459
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,620
But I've got my eye on him.

460
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,620
Tell me something.

461
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,340
I've not been in the police long
but try me.

462
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,940
What means the word your captain uses: "Nip"?
Any special meaning?

463
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,220
Why'd he stop? I said to beware!
What's going on?

464
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,940
Just a simultaneous translation problem!
Ninja!

465
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:35,020
Cut the crap.
We're at the meeting point in... now.

466
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,220
-Don't worry!
-General alert.

467
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,180
Shit!
There's a missile pointing at me.

468
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,220
Missile? What missile?

469
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:33,020
Atlas real-time missile diversion. Unique!
The Limeys won't get the ball!

470
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,420
Impressive, but where's it headed?

471
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,940
Don't worry. Somewhere far out at sea.

472
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,740
Shit, my boat!

473
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,700
The high point of our show.

474
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,380
Impressive!

475
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,740
Very good work, Gibert

476
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:23,740
Thank you, sir, I'm so pleased to be able to try out
this equipment at last. I'm so pleased.

477
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,940
Roadhog!

478
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,260
OK, the coast is clear.

479
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,220
Ninja!

480
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,940
-Impressive.
-You get used to it.

481
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,260
A regular day in Marseille.
I see.

482
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,620
Your moves are improving, but not accent.

483
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,060
Oh? Spring Roll!

484
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,780
Copy? Just fine. Did you make it...
I mean, are you here?

485
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,660
1st attack completed.
Be with you in 5. Ready?

486
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:24,860
Petra and I were checking
a few things out.

487
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,900
Emilien, Gibert here.
I'm counting in you.

488
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,020
You can count on me, Petra.
I mean...

489
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,820
You can count on Petra!

490
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,340
Count on Petra!

491
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,700
Go!

492
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,740
-Dammit, I told you to warm up!
-We're hot! Sure!

493
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,740
Gibert will kill you guys! Go warm up!

494
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,820
Just off to the little girls' room...

495
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,100
I'll go with you. You never know.

496
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,540
Can't you read?

497
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,340
It says "Green light"! Get a move on, you fag!
Oh shit!

498
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,380
Now turn left. I repeat, left.

499
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,860
Yes, chief.
I repeat, chief!

500
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,700
-He says you drive well.
-I'm not moving!

501
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,980
It freaks me out
not to hear the engine speak to me.

502
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,980
Putting in earplugs?
Do I talk too much?

503
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,860
Nein! It's a miniature ear transmitter.

504
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,580
Brand new! I'm on Channel 1.

505
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,540
But how do we talk?

506
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,020
I know you French can't handle it.

507
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,620
but an order
isn't to be discussed!

508
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:47,780
Yeah, but if you have a problem...
what do I do?

509
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,940
Can you hear me?

510
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,900
1 bang means yes, 2 means no!

511
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,060
Mind if we keep chatting?

512
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,820
That's good, 'cause...

513
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,780
The closed door
makes it easier to talk to you.

514
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,900
I don't dare to say things to your face.

515
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,700
You eyes trouble me.
They're so...

516
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,260
so blue!

517
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,340
-What's Spring Roll up to?
-What?

518
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:36,460
It's in code.
I just can't find the translation.

519
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,580
When your eyes look at me... wow!
It's a 1st.

520
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,540
or I had my back turned.

521
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:47,300
-Part of method?
-You bet! Danie"s method!

522
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,660
It's good to open my heart to you.

523
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,180
You don't mind too much?

524
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,460
Petra?

525
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:05,460
-Should I go on, then?
I don't get it!

526
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:10,660
Have you noticed
that I'm much closer to you now?

527
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,820
"No"?

528
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,540
Good!

529
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,140
Ok, Petra, I'll say something
you may find shocking...

530
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,780
Here goes...

531
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,500
He'll screw up!

532
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,780
Well... since Day One. I've known...

533
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,980
I love you!

534
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,980
-Well played!
-Told you!

535
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,100
There, I said it!

536
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:47,220
Now put me out of my misery:
is it mutual? So...

537
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,460
1 bang: yes, 2 means no.

538
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,780
Change channels to talk dirty!
We're working!

539
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,020
-Daniel? Left here, kid.
-Yes, pops!

540
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,740
He's not one of us.

541
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,540
That's for sure.
He's not one of us.

542
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:49,420
What're you playing at?
Go on! Ninja!

543
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,500
Sorry to be so down:
I smell a thing.

544
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:56,900
Smell trap? I don't smell a thing.
Do you, sir?

545
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:04,780
Strange how those trucks are parked.
just room for 1 car!

546
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:11,260
No, there's no trap.
I checked the map. No trap here.

547
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,020
-Drive on!
-If you say so.

548
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,540
I should know.

549
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,020
Well, I never! A trap!

550
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,620
What's he up to?

551
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,700
What page?

552
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,020
That's not on my list.

553
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,740
Hats off!

554
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,140
Glad it's not my taxi!

555
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,940
Petra!

556
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,140
What happened? Where's the Nip?

557
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,700
Some Ninjas... came and the Secretary went...

558
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,540
What? He didn't fly away?

559
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,900
He did! At that speed
he must be on his way to Mars!

560
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,220
Ask Atlas. It must've spotted him!

561
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,740
General alert!

562
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,460
Stop! Police

563
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,740
Shit!

564
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,340
Complex town, huh?

565
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:28,980
Small streets!
The jails are no bigger!

566
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,620
Lie down there!
I'm a crack shot so no tricks!

567
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,220
You speak French?

568
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:40,260
Me warn you: me shoot!
Spread out!

569
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,100
Is that how you wanna play it?
All right!

570
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:12,620
Now where are they?
They didn't fly away?

571
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,260
Where's Emilien?
Emilien?

572
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,260
I reckon he's near the garbage.

573
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,300
I was this close to getting 'em,
but I was outnumbered.

574
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,700
-They took the Secretary!
-Which one?

575
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,140
The Nip, not ours.
It's a disaster!

576
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,500
Yeah, and they got Petra, too.

577
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:37,060
Good. She speaks Japanese,
so he'll be less alone.

578
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:07,580
Lilly, I'm coming.
Your dad made me stay!

579
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:11,300
But it's been 2 hours.
I'm hot all over.

580
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,980
-All over?
-Yeah, all over!

581
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,140
I'll be on fire soon.

582
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,740
I'm coming. Watch a documentary
it'll calm you down!

583
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,700
-I'll be 5 minutes.
-Too long!

584
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,980
4 minutes!
Emilien!

585
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:41,300
It's my fault
for leaving her in the john!

586
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,500
-You should gone with her.
-I thought of that. I did. But...

587
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:51,220
Finished scratching about yet?
You've been scratching for over one hour.
Find anything?

588
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,780
There were indeed cars here.
3 of them.

589
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,740
You read Sherlock Holmes to deduce that?

590
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,900
Don't you have any clues
to get us started?

591
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:07,300
We'll analyze the tire samples at the lab.
That'll tell us more.

592
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,060
They'll have time to swim back to Tokyo!

593
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,300
Thanks for everything,
but I need my taxi, now.

594
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,100
What your convertible?

595
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:25,060
We're in shit!
These clowns are shaving the road!

596
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,580
Please help us find a clue.

597
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,980
Look. Lilly's on fire. She might burn herself.

598
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:34,500
They got my girl.
Give me 2 minutes of your time.

599
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,260
Take a look,
then I'll handle it.

600
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:47,020
From below, I saw 3 black Mitsubishits.

601
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,100
But not sure what model.
A new model.

602
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,900
Tires straight from Japan.

603
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,620
-How'd you know?
-I smell it.

604
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,660
-Fish?
-Meaning?

605
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:59,300
-A restaurant?
-You got fish oil for brains?

606
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:03,580
Restaurants and... ports! They were at the port.
So, they were in a boat from Japan!

607
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:07,980
That's why it smells of fish. See?

608
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:12,260
Now, are they stolen cars?
Easy!  Alain!  I'm onto it.

609
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,700
OK, you put your tweezers down.

610
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:21,260
On Monday morning.
You'll get a whistle and be put on traffic duty!

611
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,820
Idiots!

612
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,500
Nothing stolen from the port.

613
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,820
Bingo? What?
It just means you were wrong.

614
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:36,100
Why wasn't the theft declared?
Why?

615
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,580
'cause they use the warehouse as a base!

616
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,820
You can be real smart!

617
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,060
-General alert!
-No, Emilien

618
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,980
That's always my line.

619
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,940
Tell me one more time.

620
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,180
Lilly, I'm on my way!
You watching TV?

621
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:00,380
No, I stopped. There was a report on animal sex.
I burned the rug!

622
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:03,660
-Lilly's worried.
-Give me that.

623
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:08,620
Tell your mom it's OK
but I need to commandeer your friend.

624
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,420
They need help.
He did a great job. Good recruit.

625
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:15,700
He'll bring me home.
You can say goodnight. Bye, hon.

626
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:19,820
C'mon, let's go.
The mission's not over.

627
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,460
What's Gibert up to?

628
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:09,300
I dunno. He's been in the john for ages
making weird noises.
Really!

629
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:29,580
-What's up?
-I can't tell you. It's... too horrible!

630
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,820
-They won't come, Emilien.
-What?

631
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:50,620
I think this was their 1st base.
They're gone.

632
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,900
Long gone.

633
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,900
Suspect approaching. Asian male.

634
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,380
They always return to the crime scene!

635
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,660
Police academy, lesson 1!

636
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,460
Positions!

637
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:24,300
-Captain?
-Suspects approaching front door.

638
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,540
Perfect!
I'm ready for 'em!

639
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,740
Hey Marco, you sure about this?

640
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:46,460
What?
It's the heist of the century!

641
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:50,820
There's a mountain of VCRs
boxed and awaiting delivery!

642
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,820
They're about to break in.

643
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:57,140
-We got 'em! Emilien!
-You break in to your home?

644
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,980
Sure. Oh, yeah?
Well, no.

645
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,940
Uh-oh! Are you gonna...?
Chief.

646
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:10,900
I like to stay close to my men.

647
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:16,340
Some action won't hurt me.
just like in the old days!

648
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:20,540
-It was long ago.
-Memory is distant, Emilien...

649
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,980
-but the reflexes still intact!

650
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,700
-Believe me...

651
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,300
Thanks!

652
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:41,100
-Sure there's no cops?
-Relax, admit! There's no one here!

653
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:45,900
They're all watching the game.
Every cop's in front of a TV.

654
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,820
Ready to attack? Wait for my signal.

655
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:58,060
-You worry me. It's long way down.
-It's OK.

656
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:02,620
-Tie the knot. I'll do the rest.
-Uh-oh...

657
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:07,340
See?
They're all at the match, like I said!

658
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,140
Attack!

659
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,300
Shit!

660
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:26,260
-Emilien?
-OK, chief.
-Banzai!

661
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:29,700
Someone being knifed?

662
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:38,660
not's all right...
Yeah.

663
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,500
Emilien.
Maybe the rope.

664
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,100
-You got wrong one.
-You're right.

665
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,420
Ambulance!
Now!

666
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:10,500
It's all my fault.
I should never have left her or let him down.

667
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:16,340
Hey, that's enough.
Crying over spilled milk!

668
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:19,980
It won't bring her back. Think!
I am!

669
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,060
But we don't have a single lead to go on!
Ask the right questions.

670
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,980
Why didn't the Yakuza kill him at once?

671
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:27,020
-They need him?
-Why?

672
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:29,820
-Did they ask for a ransom?
-No.

673
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:32,620
Why kidnap him here?
Right.

674
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:37,260
They must have had a good reason.
Why's he going to Paris?

675
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:42,380
To sign contracts.
Security, trains, army, nuclear...

676
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,300
There! Maybe they want to stop him.

677
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,940
Makes no sense.
Why'd they do that?

678
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:51,460
He's right.
Yuki Tsumoto wants to stop him.

679
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:55,420
I know you.
Weren't you an air hostess before?

680
00:58:55,860 --> 00:59:00,780
I'm here to protect the Secretary.
I'm in counter-espionage.

681
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:05,060
Funny! I too am...
Emilien, Marseille-Police.

682
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:08,820
-That's Daniel.
-Intern. I'm learning to be stupid!

683
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,980
Clever!
Who's this Yuki Tsumoto?

684
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:16,540
Yakuza. Controls the north.
Powerful and conservative.

685
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:20,060
Refuses airplanes, trains, nuclear power...

686
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:25,180
France is keen to sell, he's taking steps.
The Secretary won't sign nor will Japan ever again!

687
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,780
Tsumoto sent over 2 masters in hypnosis.

688
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:34,300
The Secretary, when the time is right...

689
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:37,660
will shoot someone
perphaps the President.

690
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:42,380
France will sever
all diplomatics ties for years?

691
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,220
-Exactly.
-Crazy!

692
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:48,300
-We must free your friend and Secretary before 11.
-We don't have much time left.

693
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,620
Sure. I better tell my boss.
The cripple or Sleeping Beauty?

694
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:56,700
Oh, yeah. Listen...
You both got someone to save.

695
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:01,900
As we're in a rush
we better not disturb the powers that be.

696
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,900
-No?
-Right!

697
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:08,060
No Nip will beat us!
Pardon me! Where do we start?

698
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,260
First, can you find them in Paris?

699
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:13,020
-No way.
-Easy! Child's play!

700
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:43,260
Thanks, Joe. You saved my life!
See you soon, pal.

701
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:47,700
I've found them.
They're hiding out in southern Paris.

702
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,340
Sure it's her?
Uh, them!

703
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:54,860
3 black Mitsubishits with a blonde.
OK?

704
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:59,740
OK, OK. Not much time left.
To the airport! No plane for 3 hours.

705
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:04,620
We can't wait. We must get there right away!
Think!

706
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,540
Get up! It's war!

707
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:11,180
-Men!
-It's me, Daniel!

708
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:13,620
Daniel! The troops?

709
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:18,220
Wiped out! Just us to save the day.
You're indebted to me.

710
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,700
-Affirmative!
-I need your help.

711
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:37,060
Shit! What're they up to?

712
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,700
Cool, pall! Way to go!

713
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:54,060
I really hope you know what you're doing!
'Cause I don't!

714
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,900
-Got a better idea?
-Right now? No.

715
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,740
Well, think fast!

716
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:23,740
-I got it! Let me out.
-Too late!

717
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:47,820
-Are you cool?
-You bet! Cool as ice!

718
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:50,380
Just shout, OK?

719
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:54,980
OK, I'm shouting!
We lost a parachute!

720
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:59,260
There are 3. 1 or 2 always screw up!
Oh right!

721
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:05,820
-Emilien. Got your license?
-Yes.

722
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:09,340
-So, take over here.
-C'mon, move!

723
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,700
-I'll steer us.
-Where do I go?

724
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:22,580
Straight ahead!

725
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:24,820
-Straight ahead? OK!
-OK! Whatever you say.

726
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:29,900
Come on, just relax.
Be more zen.

727
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,620
That's good.
Real good.

728
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:39,900
Oh, Lilly, you OK?

729
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:43,660
-Who's the warbler?
-Air hostess.
-Air hostess?

730
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:47,820
-No, a nurse!
-You in a massage parlor?

731
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:52,780
No way, Lilly! We're in the sky.
Your dad's guiding us.

732
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:55,700
Emilien steering.
I'm fixing a parachute

733
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:58,540
-the nurse is singing to calm us down!

734
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:00,380
You smoke a tree?!?

735
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:04,500
Lilly, listen to me.
I'm trying to save Petra and Japan's Secretary!

736
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:08,740
I'll call you when we land!
Goddammit!

737
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:12,260
-You OK, hon?
-Just fine!

738
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,140
What a doubter!

739
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:20,500
Try to turn left a bit.

740
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:24,340
Now, turn left.
I repeat, left.

741
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:38,540
Hi there!

742
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:44,740
It's OK! Stay calm! Marseille Police!
Move!

743
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:54,540
-You know them?
-Yeah.

744
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:58,620
An old pupil.
Well, I'll walk home.

745
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,860
-OK, Lionel.
-Jacques.

746
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,060
-Mr Coutta. Hello there.
-How are you?

747
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:12,620
-All set, Coutta?
-Just Japan's Secretary to come.

748
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,820
I see her!
God, she's lovely!

749
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:42,860
-I mean, she looks well.
-The Secretary?

750
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:45,780
Fine.
He's exercising.

751
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,020
we know where they are now.

752
01:05:55,260 --> 01:06:00,100
-Maybe we should get'em back.
-I've got an idea. But we must warn your friend.

753
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:02,660
-It won't be easy! What a jerk I am!
-Really?

754
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:05,220
Her earphone!

755
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:08,140
Petra!

756
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:13,060
Are you ready to kill?

757
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,740
You hear me? Petra?

758
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:21,940
We're not far away.

759
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:27,860
Get up,
and turn around!

760
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,100
Show me your hands.

761
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:41,100
-What's going on?
-It's not me.

762
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,780
-idiot!

763
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:45,940
Sit down. We're coming.

764
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:48,580
-Easy to say!
-I got a plan.

765
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,420
That's what worries me!

766
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:55,820
You here only what I tell you...

767
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:59,580
You obey me.

768
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:06,820
You do only what I tell you.

769
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:18,980
I wanna go home...

770
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:32,300
You're going to sleep.

771
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:39,460
Raise your arms.

772
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:48,260
Con-nichon-a!
Hey, it's my turn now! Come on!

773
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:50,940
I'm not bad at hypnosis!

774
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:53,620
Sit!
Good!

775
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:57,860
Now lie down!

776
01:07:58,060 --> 01:07:59,940
Very, very good! Now sleep!

777
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:06,220
Freeze or you'll sleep, too!

778
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,540
OK, I'll cover you.

779
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,500
Hey, girls, what're you doing?

780
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:03,820
No need. I had'em covered.

781
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:06,940
-It's not loaded.
-What's that?

782
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:10,180
-How come?

783
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:14,260
It was me. I emptied the clip yesterday.

784
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:18,860
So... it was never loaded?

785
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:23,340
So you wouldn't get hurt.

786
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:47,740
I'm late. Help me out!

787
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:53,300
It's OK, I'll manage.

788
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,300
-Jump in there! -Are you sure?
-I don't wanna fall down!

789
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:21,980
Catch those clowns!

790
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:49,900
Fancy some sushi?

791
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:51,460
No exit, Daniel!

792
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,540
Nips closing in!

793
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:37,500
One less!

794
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,340
We'll get out here.

795
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:03,980
We're too heavy.
They're good!

796
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:06,380
Ask your colleagues to help out.

797
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:08,900
Forget it. Paris Police hate us.

798
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:11,860
They will never help.

799
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:14,140
-You just never asked 'em politely!
-What the...?

800
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:27,460
You faggots not at the parade?
Soldiers ain't your thing?

801
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:32,580
You'd rather stay home and gobble knobs?

802
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:37,340
How 'bout a love parade?
Catch me if you can!

803
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:47,420
-You went a bit far!
-Don't worry! They love it!

804
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:53,620
Catch him alive!
I'll kill him myself!

805
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:10,260
Where are you?

806
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:14,620
Where is Trocadero?

807
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:16,700
Change at Chatelet!

808
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:34,620
A bus!

809
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:50,580
Oh, the Eiffel Tower!

810
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,060
Off the grass!

811
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:16,540
-Straight on!
-OK!

812
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:25,220
-There's one!
-Get the taxi!

813
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,580
-Kamikaze!
-Kami what?

814
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,420
Kamikaze!
Banzai!

815
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:51,580
I can't shake 'em! We're too heavy!

816
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:54,980
-I'll get out!
-No, try again!
-I can't.

817
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:01,300
-Call the General.
-General!

818
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,620
Loud 'n' clear!
How's your tour going?

819
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:06,380
Whizzing by!

820
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:11,060
He's gotta block the Dauphine tunnel.
We'll trap 'em!

821
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:12,860
Give me 5 minutes.

822
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:16,500
-Hello?
-Picard?

823
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,780
-Bertineau here.
-Sir!

824
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:23,340
-Got a spare tank or two?
-Sure I have.

825
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:27,660
He better hurry up!

826
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:41,900
We're there. What's he up to?

827
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:46,060
OK, sir
the tunnel is blocked.

828
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,860
-4 mins, 32.
-Well done, sir!

829
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:50,980
Hang on!

830
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:59,620
-I don't wanna play!
-You wanna get shot down?

831
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:02,940
I don't wanna hit a tank!

832
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:06,180
Daniel. I wanna spend time with Petra
before I die!

833
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:09,580
Don't worry.
I'm taking you to Heaven!

834
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:13,340
I wanna stay here on Earth!

835
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:57,740
-You scared me again!
-Maybe one day you'll trust me!

836
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:05,860
You're wonderful.
Be his driver in Japan.

837
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:10,060
Thanks, but right now,
I just want to go home.

838
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:14,060
Yeah, we're going home.
Want dropping off somewhere?

839
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:21,660
-Not the TV!
-just five minutes

840
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:24,940
I want to see your father.

841
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:37,180
It looks like Danie"s taxi!
It's great.

842
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:45,380
Emilien?

843
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:59,580
Well, that's brand new.

844
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:02,180
A... stealth taxi.

845
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:06,420
I'll drop you at the grandstand.

846
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:08,260
This place freaks me out.

847
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:25,020
