1
00:00:40,928 --> 00:00:44,056
Please, you have to tell him.

2
00:00:44,332 --> 00:00:47,130
I would never steal from him.

3
00:00:47,335 --> 00:00:48,335
Please.

4
00:00:49,737 --> 00:00:51,432
You can tell him yourself.

5
00:01:08,856 --> 00:01:10,790
Please, Mr. Rabbit.

6
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:13,118
- Please.
- Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

7
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,988
Did you steal from me, Yuri?

8
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:20,292
No. Please. Let me explain.

9
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:23,664
Did you steal from me?

10
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,549
Yes.

11
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:45,984
Thank you.

12
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:47,421
Why?

13
00:01:47,628 --> 00:01:49,619
For being honest with me.

14
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,298
Now we can talk like men again.

15
00:03:30,664 --> 00:03:31,892
- Budmo.
- Hey!

16
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:33,157
- Budmo!
- Hey!

17
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:35,267
- Budmo!
- Hey!

18
00:03:36,804 --> 00:03:37,804
Mmm.

19
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,606
And I toast the two of you.

20
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:44,801
The truck job
was brilliantly executed.

21
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:47,572
Tell me, how did you get
your false credentials for that job?

22
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:49,248
The background check
should have taken six months.

23
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,974
Yeah, I know a guy.

24
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:53,119
It sounds like
we should all know this guy.

25
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,685
- Yeah.
- He doesn't like crowds.

26
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:55,922
Leave him, Olek.

27
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,422
Where would we be
without our secrets?

28
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:01,690
- Budmo.
- Hey.

29
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:06,759
So, you've had a very good year.

30
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:08,298
One last job next week

31
00:04:08,502 --> 00:04:10,129
and then we go
quiet for a while, yes?

32
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,039
What? What?

33
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:16,001
That's what someone
always says in the movies

34
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:17,438
- right before they get caught.
- Stop it.

35
00:04:17,645 --> 00:04:18,873
- I'm just saying.
- Well, don't say.

36
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,445
- Well, you know.
- You watch too many movies.

37
00:04:21,682 --> 00:04:23,775
Why don't you
watch some with me?

38
00:04:23,984 --> 00:04:25,508
Learn some English.
Get rid of some of that accent.

39
00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:27,846
- It's part of my charm.
- Is that what you call it?

40
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:30,888
Daddy, what's this last job?

41
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:33,059
Capital Diamond.

42
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:37,763
- Seriously?
- We've been down this road.

43
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:40,456
I know, but I have
some new information.

44
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:43,167
One package,

45
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,201
10 million in loose stones.

46
00:04:45,406 --> 00:04:46,726
Listen, that place is a fortress.

47
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,866
- The electronics alone...
- Yes, but luckily, you know a guy.

48
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:51,969
Right?

49
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,211
Well, I am wiped.

50
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,583
I'm gonna go home.

51
00:04:56,784 --> 00:04:58,411
Olek will drive you.

52
00:05:00,454 --> 00:05:03,855
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, Anastasia.

53
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:09,894
Night.

54
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:20,964
- Thanks.
- So?

55
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:23,234
- What?
- I know when you're troubled.

56
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:28,414
Look, Capital Diamond,
it's high risk.

57
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:31,617
Yes. Are you worried?

58
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:37,822
I don't know yet.
Just let me do some recon.

59
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:41,519
You listen to me.

60
00:05:41,695 --> 00:05:44,596
Every time you and Ana
go out on a job,

61
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:48,292
I'm trusting you
with my daughter's life.

62
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:50,369
I could never do that

63
00:05:50,537 --> 00:05:53,267
if I didn't see you as a son.

64
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,203
Do you understand?

65
00:05:58,045 --> 00:06:00,206
You do your research.

66
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,574
You consider the risk.

67
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:07,010
You decide.

68
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,085
Have a good night.

69
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,922
You look very beautiful tonight.

70
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,527
Thank you.

71
00:06:20,768 --> 00:06:23,100
Why don't I come in
for one more drink?

72
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:28,268
It's been such a long night.

73
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:31,309
I can barely keep my eyes open.

74
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:33,007
Another time.

75
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:34,375
Sure.

76
00:06:34,548 --> 00:06:35,981
Thanks for the lift.

77
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,512
Good night.

78
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:59,636
I need to get a better lock.

79
00:07:00,808 --> 00:07:02,673
I'd just come through the window.

80
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:36,008
What?

81
00:07:36,176 --> 00:07:37,370
You know what.

82
00:07:38,278 --> 00:07:40,508
We said it had to be the big one.

83
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:43,378
10 million in loose stones,
that's pretty big.

84
00:07:44,585 --> 00:07:46,746
No one's ever stolen
from Rabbit before and lived.

85
00:07:46,954 --> 00:07:48,512
We could do this.

86
00:07:49,156 --> 00:07:51,420
- He'll kill you.
- No, he won't.

87
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:53,319
He won't. By the time Rabbit

88
00:07:53,494 --> 00:07:55,254
realizes what's going on,
we'll be long gone.

89
00:07:55,395 --> 00:07:57,454
- He'll find us.
- No, he won't.

90
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:00,464
I have it handled.

91
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:04,061
You have it handled?

92
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:05,733
Yeah.

93
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:10,702
You have to be a little
more specific than that.

94
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:15,215
You know what? You're right.

95
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:20,212
- I think you're ready.
- Ready for what?

96
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:22,680
Not what, who.

97
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:24,488
Who?

98
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:27,161
Who?

99
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:28,161
Who?

100
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:29,890
Whoo! Go, girl.

101
00:08:45,412 --> 00:08:47,312
You take me to
the nicest places.

102
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:26,643
Nice shoes.

103
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,287
Did your daddy buy those for you

104
00:09:28,455 --> 00:09:30,946
before or after he sodomized you?

105
00:09:31,091 --> 00:09:32,285
What did he say?

106
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:36,255
That was nasty.

107
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,393
I'm sorry,
I couldn't hear you over the music.

108
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:44,031
What was that you were saying?

109
00:09:44,171 --> 00:09:45,763
I said your daddy ass raped you.

110
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:50,671
No, no, no.
This here's a place

111
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:53,938
where we all can come
to express ourselves freely.

112
00:09:54,248 --> 00:09:55,909
Lord knows I do.

113
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:58,413
These gentlemen here
have every bit as much right

114
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:01,144
to express themselves as any of us.

115
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:02,718
I applaud you gentlemen.

116
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,551
Coming here was an act
of great courage.

117
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:06,423
At this stage in your lives

118
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,356
when you're struggling
with your homosexuality.

119
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:11,394
Still buying each other rounds,

120
00:10:11,565 --> 00:10:13,726
hoping one of you gets drunk enough
to suck the other one's dick

121
00:10:13,901 --> 00:10:16,597
and then pretend to
forget about it in the morning.

122
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,494
Let's hear it
for our new gay friends,

123
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:20,036
ladies and gentlemen.

124
00:10:20,274 --> 00:10:21,536
Let's give them a hand.

125
00:10:23,443 --> 00:10:24,842
I am gonna fuck you up!

126
00:10:25,112 --> 00:10:26,739
Baby, you ain't my type.

127
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,088
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

128
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:37,416
I'll be here all week.

129
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:41,127
Let's go.

130
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:47,694
Hey, Job. How you doing?

131
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:50,893
Another night,
another drunk bigot to emasculate.

132
00:10:51,171 --> 00:10:52,331
You almost made it
through the whole song.

133
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:53,773
You're getting better.

134
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:55,272
- Fuck you.
- You, too.

135
00:10:57,077 --> 00:10:58,077
So this is her?

136
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:00,337
Job, Ana.
Ana, Job.

137
00:11:00,948 --> 00:11:02,210
Hello.

138
00:11:04,618 --> 00:11:06,916
Honey, you're much too hot
to be shopping retail.

139
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,920
That dress means well,
but it's cut all wrong.

140
00:11:08,922 --> 00:11:11,203
Thanks, but I don't know
if we're going for the same look.

141
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:12,653
Style is style, honey.

142
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:15,692
You either got it
or you just think you do.

143
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:20,232
Come on,
I'll give you the nickel tour.

144
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,458
Place looks great.

145
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:23,034
The place is an abortion.

146
00:11:23,203 --> 00:11:24,966
Sometimes I think I'm just
gonna gut the whole thing

147
00:11:25,172 --> 00:11:26,730
and open a hair salon.

148
00:11:26,907 --> 00:11:27,907
You cut hair?

149
00:11:27,908 --> 00:11:30,308
Baby, I've hacked the CIA,
the FBI, and the World Bank.

150
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:32,206
I think I can probably cut some hair.

151
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:33,626
How we doing on the diamond job?

152
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:36,606
- It'll be ready when you are.
- And the other thing?

153
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:42,078
You'll be Carrie and Tom Palmer.

154
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:44,382
Licenses, credit cards,
checking accounts.

155
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:46,491
I've already leased you
matching Hondas.

156
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,318
You're both boring as shit.

157
00:11:48,595 --> 00:11:51,155
Carrie.
That'll take some getting used to.

158
00:11:51,498 --> 00:11:53,193
Well, then you'd best get started.

159
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:56,630
'Cause, girl,
I am not doing it again.

160
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:13,677
Can I help you, Agent?

161
00:12:16,156 --> 00:12:17,282
Now how can you tell?

162
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,649
If you weren't a fed,

163
00:12:19,826 --> 00:12:23,455
Viktor over there would have already
made you pay for your disrespect.

164
00:12:24,297 --> 00:12:25,696
I'm Agent Jim Racine.

165
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:27,366
I'm taking over
for Agent Daniels.

166
00:12:28,435 --> 00:12:30,164
What happened to Paul?

167
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,937
Paul was dirty.

168
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,637
But then I don't
have to tell you that.

169
00:12:36,043 --> 00:12:37,476
I've been playing the game.

170
00:12:37,677 --> 00:12:38,974
All the usual stuff...

171
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:42,013
wiretaps, surveillance, shakedowns.

172
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,974
And today I thought:

173
00:12:44,317 --> 00:12:46,581
"I'm spending all this time
looking at this guy,"

174
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:50,323
"I ought to just come down
and meet him face-to-face."

175
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:54,220
I hope you're not disappointed.

176
00:12:54,528 --> 00:12:55,927
On the contrary.

177
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,694
It's a real thrill.

178
00:12:59,032 --> 00:13:00,727
It's a shame about Paul.

179
00:13:01,802 --> 00:13:02,962
I quite liked him.

180
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:07,038
Of course you did.
He was weak and stupid.

181
00:13:07,274 --> 00:13:09,936
You're very sure of yourself,
Agent Racine.

182
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,501
Is that gonna be a problem for you?

183
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:14,978
Not at all.

184
00:13:18,385 --> 00:13:20,819
It will make it
all the more pleasurable

185
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:22,477
when I break you.

186
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:33,729
Don't be a stranger.

187
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:58,284
So we're looking for a
Chinese gangster named Fat Au?

188
00:13:58,492 --> 00:14:00,824
- He's not Chinese.
- The Triads are backing him?

189
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:03,086
It's kind of hard to explain.

190
00:14:03,363 --> 00:14:05,991
He's someone I knew
from the old days. Before your time.

191
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,794
Rabbit's not gonna
be alone in that church.

192
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:09,161
We need more firepower.

193
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:11,289
- Oh, so he's a gun dealer?
- Among other things.

194
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:13,530
- Are you sure he's gonna help you?
- No.

195
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:16,605
We had a complicated relationship,

196
00:14:16,743 --> 00:14:17,869
but I did him a favor once.

197
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:21,240
- I hope he remembers.
- Me, too.

198
00:14:34,928 --> 00:14:36,293
Hey, hey.

199
00:14:37,197 --> 00:14:38,596
Yeah, I'm looking for Fat Au.

200
00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:40,265
There's no Fat Au here.

201
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:43,095
Yeah, I'm not a cop, okay?

202
00:14:43,336 --> 00:14:44,860
I'm an old friend of his.

203
00:14:46,072 --> 00:14:48,272
He's gonna be very upset
if he hears you turned me away.

204
00:14:48,408 --> 00:14:49,602
I don't know
what you're talking about.

205
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:51,276
This is a private club.

206
00:14:51,478 --> 00:14:53,158
- Get lost.
- I came a long way to see him.

207
00:14:53,213 --> 00:14:55,010
That's too bad.
Now get the fuck out of here.

208
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:56,448
We better go.

209
00:14:56,683 --> 00:14:59,049
Hang tight. Just do what I do.

210
00:14:59,486 --> 00:15:01,386
- What are you gonna do?
- This.

211
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:19,596
- You're welcome.
- Shit!

212
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:24,141
Don't fucking move.

213
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:29,706
Well, the good news is

214
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,542
we're going to see Fat Au.

215
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:01,677
Now who the fuck are you?

216
00:16:01,815 --> 00:16:03,975
- Are you kidding me?
- I look like a fucking comedian?

217
00:16:04,117 --> 00:16:06,381
You look like two fucking comedians.

218
00:16:17,831 --> 00:16:19,298
I heard you died, man.

219
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:22,701
Yeah, I heard the same thing.

220
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:24,664
Y'all get the fuck out of here.

221
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:26,563
So you're running things now, huh?

222
00:16:26,773 --> 00:16:28,570
Somebody's got to keep the peace.

223
00:16:30,377 --> 00:16:32,607
Who is this you brought with you?

224
00:16:32,746 --> 00:16:35,010
- This is Ana.
- Hello, beautiful.

225
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:36,682
What can I get you? Anything.

226
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,781
Name it, it's yours.

227
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:42,614
Eight Springfield automatics
with silencers,

228
00:16:42,756 --> 00:16:44,815
preferably the AAC
Prodigy suppressors,

229
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:47,457
a few dozen ammo packages,
and something to carry it all in.

230
00:16:47,794 --> 00:16:51,389
Ooh, I hope like hell
you're sleeping with this woman.

231
00:16:54,034 --> 00:16:56,093
Listen, I don't have the money on me.

232
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:57,429
Your money is no good here.

233
00:16:57,871 --> 00:16:59,231
You risked your life to save mine.

234
00:16:59,372 --> 00:17:00,452
I think about it every day.

235
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,007
A few pieces of hardware
doesn't begin to make us even.

236
00:17:04,778 --> 00:17:05,778
Thank you.

237
00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:08,237
Now, with that being said,

238
00:17:08,581 --> 00:17:11,049
I've got to ask,
what are you gonna do with the guns?

239
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:12,877
Target practice.

240
00:17:13,153 --> 00:17:15,018
Not below Canal Street, you hear me?

241
00:17:15,188 --> 00:17:16,712
You got it.

242
00:17:16,923 --> 00:17:17,981
All right, then.

243
00:17:18,191 --> 00:17:19,871
Package will be waiting
for you downstairs.

244
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:21,827
- Just like that?
- Oh, honey.

245
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:25,497
If I weren't so smitten,
I'd be insulted.

246
00:17:26,032 --> 00:17:28,500
Now, let's celebrate, huh?

247
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,367
Soldier boy.

248
00:17:31,571 --> 00:17:32,731
Back from the dead.

249
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:35,865
Today is a blessed day.

250
00:17:39,112 --> 00:17:40,636
Why did he call you "soldier boy"?

251
00:17:40,847 --> 00:17:43,372
- It's just a nickname.
- Yeah, I know, but why?

252
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,948
I guess when we first met,
I was a soldier.

253
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,779
You never told me
you were in the Army.

254
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,080
Not in the Army. Not exactly.

255
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,849
Anyway, it was a long time ago.

256
00:17:53,126 --> 00:17:54,650
How many lives have you lived?

257
00:17:54,828 --> 00:17:55,828
None, really.

258
00:18:03,503 --> 00:18:04,902
You ready for the diamond job?

259
00:18:05,338 --> 00:18:06,430
Will be.

260
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:11,034
It's a big score. Big risk.

261
00:18:12,445 --> 00:18:14,106
You got something on your mind?

262
00:18:14,381 --> 00:18:16,906
So much money. So much risk.

263
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:22,179
Some men would think
to take the money and run.

264
00:18:26,459 --> 00:18:27,551
Where would I go?

265
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:30,025
I don't know.
But I would find you.

266
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:32,426
You want to talk shit
or you want to box, huh?

267
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:34,233
I want to fight.

268
00:18:44,277 --> 00:18:45,574
What the fuck, Olek?

269
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:48,637
Whoo, that was a good shot.

270
00:18:49,315 --> 00:18:50,680
I see stars.

271
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:57,147
You crazy motherfucker.

272
00:18:57,323 --> 00:19:00,053
That's why
they pay me the big dollars.

273
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:13,401
You're quiet today.

274
00:19:16,476 --> 00:19:18,034
I'm just thinking.

275
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,575
Are you worried about this job?

276
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:24,876
We could still walk away.

277
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:28,220
No. No, I think
we have that covered.

278
00:19:28,588 --> 00:19:30,180
So, what, then?

279
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,187
It's nothing, Daddy. I'm fine.

280
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:39,396
You wouldn't keep something from me,
would you?

281
00:19:43,036 --> 00:19:44,628
Of course not.

282
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:51,366
He knows.

283
00:19:51,678 --> 00:19:52,975
He doesn't know.

284
00:19:54,247 --> 00:19:56,078
You didn't hear him
this morning.

285
00:19:56,249 --> 00:19:58,513
There's no way
he could possibly know.

286
00:19:58,918 --> 00:20:00,476
You're reading into things.

287
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:03,278
I think we should wait.

288
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:09,384
Hey, listen to me.

289
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:11,457
He doesn't know.

290
00:20:11,531 --> 00:20:12,657
Okay?

291
00:20:13,466 --> 00:20:15,798
Look, every time we steal for him,

292
00:20:15,935 --> 00:20:17,232
we risk our lives.

293
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,869
Why not risk our lives for us?

294
00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:23,438
- I just have a bad feeling about it.
- Hey, hey, hey.

295
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,700
He doesn't know.

296
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:54,768
It's two miles from the highway
surrounded by forest.

297
00:20:55,074 --> 00:20:56,974
At least we got that going for us.

298
00:20:57,176 --> 00:20:59,167
The package is in a safe
on the top floor.

299
00:20:59,546 --> 00:21:00,672
How do you know all this?

300
00:21:00,847 --> 00:21:02,144
You know a guy, I know a guy.

301
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:03,975
Hey, you just worry about getting in.

302
00:21:04,317 --> 00:21:06,114
There are two guard dogs
on free patrol.

303
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,353
The entrance has a fingerprint scan.

304
00:21:08,555 --> 00:21:11,080
The lobby has video
surveillance and infrared.

305
00:21:11,257 --> 00:21:13,217
This will get you through
the fingerprint scanner.

306
00:21:13,393 --> 00:21:15,193
As soon as you go in,
I'll kill the infrareds,

307
00:21:15,194 --> 00:21:16,661
but they're on an automatic reset.

308
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:19,354
You got 12 minutes to get in,
crack the safe, and get out.

309
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:21,758
The safe is a Xerxes XO series.

310
00:21:21,935 --> 00:21:23,129
That's no problem.

311
00:21:23,403 --> 00:21:25,268
It's not gonna be easy.

312
00:21:25,405 --> 00:21:27,168
Nothing worthwhile ever is.

313
00:21:27,307 --> 00:21:28,467
And then what?

314
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:30,173
And then you don't call me.

315
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,310
You don't e-mail me. Nothing.

316
00:21:32,545 --> 00:21:34,240
Y'all are gonna have the cops,
the feds,

317
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,471
and the Ukrainian mafia after you.

318
00:21:36,716 --> 00:21:38,081
I don't know you anymore.

319
00:21:38,451 --> 00:21:39,884
You're having second thoughts?

320
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,711
No. No second thoughts.
We'll get it done.

321
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,282
These are your new documents.

322
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,740
You're married, by the way.

323
00:21:48,861 --> 00:21:49,953
Mazel tov.

324
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,194
- Thanks for everything, Job.
- Don't mention it.

325
00:21:53,466 --> 00:21:54,660
- No, I'm serious.
- I'm serious, too.

326
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:56,027
Don't you fucking mention it.

327
00:21:56,135 --> 00:21:57,796
I don't care if they're
blowtorching your balls off.

328
00:21:58,004 --> 00:21:59,004
You hear me?

329
00:21:59,472 --> 00:22:00,472
I'll miss you.

330
00:22:01,074 --> 00:22:02,234
Good.

331
00:22:03,543 --> 00:22:05,135
Get the fuck out of here.

332
00:22:38,811 --> 00:22:41,245
A direct assault is exactly
the wrong way to go here.

333
00:22:41,381 --> 00:22:43,662
- Take it from someone who's tried.
- What do you suggest?

334
00:22:43,716 --> 00:22:45,513
Blow the fucking place
to smithereens.

335
00:22:45,685 --> 00:22:48,347
Nuh-uh. Too messy.
We got to be sure.

336
00:22:49,622 --> 00:22:51,351
This is fucking suicide.
I'm coming.

337
00:22:51,591 --> 00:22:53,684
Hey, you won't make it
to the lobby... Job.

338
00:22:57,497 --> 00:22:58,555
Get back in bed.

339
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:11,067
Hey.

340
00:23:14,747 --> 00:23:16,681
How am I gonna know
if you're dead?

341
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:21,445
You wake up tomorrow
and we're not here, we're dead.

342
00:23:30,863 --> 00:23:32,763
Like I'm really gonna sleep tonight.

343
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:39,299
How we looking, Job?

344
00:23:39,472 --> 00:23:40,530
Police bands are quiet.

345
00:23:40,673 --> 00:23:42,163
I'm already into
the security system.

346
00:23:42,341 --> 00:23:43,341
Copy.

347
00:23:47,847 --> 00:23:49,280
Ana, come on.

348
00:23:50,983 --> 00:23:52,712
- Hey.
- We don't have to do this.

349
00:23:53,286 --> 00:23:55,083
- We can't back out now.
- Yes, we can.

350
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:56,415
I'll talk to my father.
I'll tell him about us.

351
00:23:56,556 --> 00:23:58,116
He is never going to
let us be together.

352
00:23:58,191 --> 00:23:59,591
You know this.
This is the only way.

353
00:24:04,597 --> 00:24:06,565
Baby, I have a very bad
feeling about this.

354
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,364
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

355
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:18,305
Listen to me. It's gonna be okay.

356
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:20,402
I want to report
a robbery in progress

357
00:24:20,513 --> 00:24:22,242
at the Capital Diamond warehouse.

358
00:24:22,315 --> 00:24:24,476
211 Saw Mill River Road.

359
00:24:31,624 --> 00:24:33,353
It's gonna be okay,
I promise you.

360
00:24:33,493 --> 00:24:36,929
Tomorrow we're gonna be
Tom and Carrie Palmer.

361
00:24:39,098 --> 00:24:41,259
We're gonna have
our entire lives ahead of us.

362
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,992
- Promise?
- Promise.

363
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,197
But right here, right now,

364
00:24:46,906 --> 00:24:48,931
we have to do this, okay?

365
00:24:49,108 --> 00:24:51,042
We have to.

366
00:24:51,477 --> 00:24:53,206
You ready?

367
00:24:58,317 --> 00:24:59,341
Yes.

368
00:25:00,853 --> 00:25:02,047
Okay.

369
00:26:50,463 --> 00:26:52,988
- Hello, Ana.
- Don't move!

370
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,561
I am unarmed.

371
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:02,941
- Layla.
- What?

372
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,907
You have her face.

373
00:27:06,078 --> 00:27:08,012
- Almost exactly.
- Stay there.

374
00:27:08,547 --> 00:27:11,607
I'd hoped to meet you
in friendlier circumstances.

375
00:27:11,817 --> 00:27:13,910
Not likely with our family.

376
00:27:14,487 --> 00:27:16,216
Where is he?

377
00:27:16,355 --> 00:27:17,652
He is safe.

378
00:27:18,057 --> 00:27:20,389
Whereas you, on the other hand,

379
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,384
are not.

380
00:27:30,603 --> 00:27:34,562
When a family goes to war,
there can be no victory.

381
00:27:56,696 --> 00:27:58,425
Him or us, right?

382
00:27:58,764 --> 00:27:59,890
Damn straight.

383
00:28:06,138 --> 00:28:07,298
Now!

384
00:29:14,974 --> 00:29:16,703
- You okay?
- I'm out.

385
00:29:24,283 --> 00:29:25,545
Me, too.

386
00:30:04,657 --> 00:30:07,683
Hey, stick to the trees for at least
two miles. You'll be fine.

387
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:09,554
When I get up,

388
00:30:09,728 --> 00:30:11,286
you run like hell
for the back of the church.

389
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,660
- No, I'm not leaving you.
- Listen to me! You do it!

390
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,665
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

391
00:30:15,801 --> 00:30:17,359
I'm gonna throw them off.

392
00:30:18,404 --> 00:30:19,098
No.

393
00:30:19,238 --> 00:30:21,001
You do it and you get
back to your family.

394
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:23,633
You hear me?

395
00:30:24,043 --> 00:30:25,476
Don't do this.
Don't do this.

396
00:30:25,678 --> 00:30:27,077
- We can make it.
- Hey! Hey!

397
00:30:27,246 --> 00:30:30,010
When I get up,
you run to the back.

398
00:30:30,616 --> 00:30:31,878
Understand?

399
00:30:32,017 --> 00:30:33,041
I'll catch up to you.

400
00:30:33,252 --> 00:30:34,685
I'll be right behind you.

401
00:30:38,591 --> 00:30:40,491
I love you.
I love you.

402
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:58,341
No!

403
00:31:36,582 --> 00:31:38,015
Whoo.

404
00:31:43,122 --> 00:31:45,215
Seven guys with machine guns

405
00:31:45,357 --> 00:31:47,120
and you're gonna stab them?

406
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,293
You really are
fucked in the head.

407
00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:53,169
I almost didn't shoot 'em just so I
could see you try and pull that off.

408
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:54,866
Welcome to my life.

409
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,160
Hi, guys.

410
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:00,095
- I had it handled.
- The fuck you did.

411
00:32:00,739 --> 00:32:02,468
So when did
you two hook up again?

412
00:32:02,608 --> 00:32:04,269
Job tracked me down.

413
00:32:04,443 --> 00:32:06,934
Motherfucker walked right into my
office with his gun out.

414
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,706
Looked like he was gonna pass out
right there on the floor.

415
00:32:09,348 --> 00:32:11,009
You try getting a fucking
appointment with you.

416
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,744
How about we all go downtown,
get some breakfast?

417
00:32:14,653 --> 00:32:16,587
You can tell me what
the fuck happened here.

418
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:18,709
I have a feeling it's gonna be a hell
of a story.

419
00:32:18,991 --> 00:32:20,458
You have no idea.

420
00:32:45,751 --> 00:32:47,309
This is one
fucked-up church.

421
00:32:47,586 --> 00:32:49,611
He's not who we came for.

422
00:32:50,356 --> 00:32:52,756
I'll make sure the cops
stay away for the time being.

423
00:32:52,925 --> 00:32:55,325
- Buy you guys some time.
- Thanks.

424
00:32:55,794 --> 00:32:57,159
Hey, soldier boy.

425
00:32:57,763 --> 00:32:59,287
Still want to hear that story.

426
00:33:00,566 --> 00:33:01,760
You will.

427
00:33:03,235 --> 00:33:06,136
This time, make sure
he stay dead.

428
00:33:06,872 --> 00:33:08,737
Come on, you crazy bald fuck.

429
00:33:08,974 --> 00:33:10,094
I'll buy you some breakfast.

430
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,337
This could be the start
of a beautiful,

431
00:33:13,545 --> 00:33:15,342
fucked-up friendship.

432
00:33:20,352 --> 00:33:21,614
Morning.

433
00:33:26,058 --> 00:33:28,458
The relentless Agent Racine.

434
00:33:28,661 --> 00:33:31,152
I just figured I'd stop by.

435
00:33:31,397 --> 00:33:32,887
See what you've been up to.

436
00:33:34,266 --> 00:33:35,426
What's the expression?

437
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:37,398
"Same shit,
different day."

438
00:33:38,437 --> 00:33:39,495
That's it, yeah.

439
00:33:40,673 --> 00:33:43,870
I spent the night
at the 13th Precinct downtown.

440
00:33:45,377 --> 00:33:46,901
They arrested some kid

441
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:49,445
who managed to break into
the Capital Diamond building.

442
00:33:50,783 --> 00:33:52,842
It's not an easy
place to get into.

443
00:33:53,452 --> 00:33:55,352
Kid would have gotten
away with it, too,

444
00:33:55,487 --> 00:33:59,890
except someone
tipped off the cops.

445
00:34:00,926 --> 00:34:02,587
I want to report a robbery
in progress

446
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:04,695
at the Capital Diamond
warehouse.

447
00:34:04,897 --> 00:34:06,262
211 Saw Mill River Road.

448
00:34:08,567 --> 00:34:09,567
I'm no expert,

449
00:34:09,568 --> 00:34:12,093
but that sounds a lot
like a Ukrainian accent.

450
00:34:12,338 --> 00:34:13,965
Doesn't it?

451
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:17,709
Yeah.

452
00:34:18,777 --> 00:34:20,142
So I asked myself

453
00:34:20,612 --> 00:34:22,204
how many Ukrainians do I know

454
00:34:22,448 --> 00:34:24,416
who could report
a robbery in progress

455
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:28,312
before that robbery
was actually in progress?

456
00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:31,783
And then I thought

457
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,423
Rabbit is Ukrainian.

458
00:34:33,692 --> 00:34:35,853
Maybe he could point me
in the right direction.

459
00:34:36,328 --> 00:34:38,319
So what do you say?

460
00:34:39,264 --> 00:34:41,255
Can you...

461
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,459
point me in the right direction?

462
00:34:46,238 --> 00:34:48,706
Go... now.

463
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:52,404
Yeah.

464
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:55,078
I had a feeling.

465
00:34:56,582 --> 00:34:57,913
Well...

466
00:34:59,451 --> 00:35:01,316
it was worth a try.

467
00:35:03,122 --> 00:35:04,885
Agent Racine.

468
00:35:06,058 --> 00:35:09,221
Someday I will lose my patience

469
00:35:09,628 --> 00:35:12,188
and this wall between us...

470
00:35:12,464 --> 00:35:15,092
the one you count on
to keep you safe...

471
00:35:16,935 --> 00:35:18,527
it will come down.

472
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:22,439
That's what I'm hoping for.

473
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,405
Yulish?

474
00:35:56,842 --> 00:35:58,810
- Is he dead?
- Yes.

475
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,239
- And now me?
- Yes.

476
00:36:08,687 --> 00:36:11,622
There's a part of you that always
knows it will end like this.

477
00:36:13,926 --> 00:36:16,156
Bullets and tears.

478
00:36:17,095 --> 00:36:18,619
Yet you keep telling yourself

479
00:36:18,964 --> 00:36:20,625
you will find a way out.

480
00:36:22,034 --> 00:36:23,626
But there is no way out

481
00:36:23,836 --> 00:36:25,463
because of who you are.

482
00:36:28,173 --> 00:36:29,538
Sit with me.

483
00:36:30,509 --> 00:36:32,033
Just for a minute.

484
00:36:32,211 --> 00:36:34,372
Eternity can wait a bit longer.

485
00:36:56,835 --> 00:36:59,099
I got married in this courtyard.

486
00:37:05,043 --> 00:37:06,943
The band was over there.

487
00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:10,542
Your mother...

488
00:37:12,251 --> 00:37:13,946
she was so beautiful.

489
00:37:19,224 --> 00:37:21,283
I couldn't stop shaking.

490
00:37:21,527 --> 00:37:23,893
I thought I might pass out.

491
00:37:24,162 --> 00:37:25,561
Just breathe.

492
00:37:26,832 --> 00:37:29,630
Something in me broke
when she died.

493
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:39,037
Budmo.

494
00:37:48,387 --> 00:37:50,787
I'm sorry, Anastasia.

495
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,290
I hope in death I can give you

496
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:56,052
some of the peace
I stole from you in life.

497
00:38:36,835 --> 00:38:38,564
Time will tell.

498
00:38:44,643 --> 00:38:46,406
Goodbye, Daddy.

499
00:39:06,665 --> 00:39:08,860
You look at me and remember.

500
00:39:09,301 --> 00:39:11,098
Somewhere in the future,

501
00:39:12,104 --> 00:39:14,038
there is a bench just like this

502
00:39:14,139 --> 00:39:15,629
waiting for you.

503
00:39:18,844 --> 00:39:19,902
Go to hell.

504
00:39:23,315 --> 00:39:24,612
Okay.

505
00:41:18,463 --> 00:41:20,363
- Hello?
- You fucking bastard.

506
00:41:20,732 --> 00:41:23,758
Anastasia.
I've been waiting for your call.

507
00:41:23,935 --> 00:41:25,994
- You turned us in.
- You lied to me.

508
00:41:27,005 --> 00:41:28,563
So what are you gonna do, huh?

509
00:41:28,774 --> 00:41:30,214
Are you gonna kill
your own daughter?

510
00:41:31,476 --> 00:41:33,410
No, you I forgive.

511
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,671
Well, I don't forgive you.

512
00:41:35,947 --> 00:41:37,915
And I will tell your grandchild,

513
00:41:38,049 --> 00:41:39,880
his child, who you
will never know,

514
00:41:40,252 --> 00:41:41,776
what a sick fuck you were.

515
00:41:42,788 --> 00:41:43,812
You're pregnant?

516
00:41:43,989 --> 00:41:45,081
Fuck you.

517
00:41:45,257 --> 00:41:46,724
Anastasia!

518
00:43:25,023 --> 00:43:26,923
Look at that.
We made it.

519
00:43:27,659 --> 00:43:28,717
Banshee.

520
00:43:28,894 --> 00:43:31,795
It's kind of a strange name
for a town, don't you think?

521
00:43:31,963 --> 00:43:34,295
No, it's just a town
like any other.

522
00:43:43,642 --> 00:43:46,008
I think we're gonna be
very happy here.

523
00:44:19,811 --> 00:44:21,369
Rabbit?

524
00:44:22,047 --> 00:44:23,480
He's dead.

525
00:44:26,451 --> 00:44:27,782
You sure?

526
00:44:29,321 --> 00:44:30,321
Yes.

527
00:44:31,056 --> 00:44:33,854
Well, then, good riddance.

528
00:44:51,776 --> 00:44:53,300
What about Job?

529
00:44:53,511 --> 00:44:54,808
He stayed in New York.

530
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,607
He's gonna look up
some old friends.

531
00:44:56,848 --> 00:44:58,315
Figure out his next move.

532
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,780
It's gonna be strange
without him here.

533
00:45:01,786 --> 00:45:04,414
Then again,
it's strange when he is here.

534
00:45:06,658 --> 00:45:08,091
What about you?

535
00:45:09,761 --> 00:45:11,319
What about me?

536
00:45:11,529 --> 00:45:12,928
What happens now?

537
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:36,417
I've got to go see someone.

538
00:45:36,921 --> 00:45:38,013
The deputy?

539
00:45:40,558 --> 00:45:43,220
You sure about that?

540
00:45:53,471 --> 00:45:56,531
Well, where would
we be without women to fuck us up?

541
00:45:57,976 --> 00:45:59,739
Hmm?

542
00:45:59,911 --> 00:46:01,674
I guess you came
back after all, huh?

543
00:46:05,316 --> 00:46:06,783
I guess so.

544
00:46:12,257 --> 00:46:13,724
How are things here?

545
00:46:17,095 --> 00:46:18,687
Emmett left today.

546
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:20,558
Otherwise, all quiet.

547
00:46:21,466 --> 00:46:22,558
Good.

548
00:46:23,201 --> 00:46:24,668
That's good.

549
00:46:28,873 --> 00:46:30,433
I just wanted you
to know that I'm back.

550
00:46:32,777 --> 00:46:35,371
- See you at work tomorrow.
- Hey!

551
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:38,178
Why did you come here?

552
00:46:40,785 --> 00:46:42,810
I needed to see you.

553
00:46:45,924 --> 00:46:47,653
So say that.

554
00:46:53,498 --> 00:46:56,092
I needed to see you.

555
00:46:58,236 --> 00:46:59,828
Well, now you've seen me.

556
00:47:02,674 --> 00:47:03,936
Yeah.

557
00:47:06,177 --> 00:47:07,872
Well, what are you gonna do now?

558
00:47:18,123 --> 00:47:19,556
It's okay.

559
00:47:43,181 --> 00:47:45,445
- How did you get in here?
- I have my ways.

560
00:47:50,622 --> 00:47:52,954
Do you have a message for me?

561
00:47:53,124 --> 00:47:54,250
No.

562
00:47:59,731 --> 00:48:02,564
So what can I do
for you, Amish girl?

563
00:48:03,201 --> 00:48:04,259
I don't know.

564
00:48:04,502 --> 00:48:06,299
What can you do for me?

565
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:24,921
There can be no question
of your loyalty.

566
00:48:25,523 --> 00:48:26,820
There won't be.

567
00:48:37,101 --> 00:48:39,399
Is that a knife or are you just
happy to see me?

568
00:49:07,765 --> 00:49:09,062
You stupid bitch.

569
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:14,402
You really think
you can come in here and kill me?

570
00:49:14,739 --> 00:49:15,899
Huh?

571
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:21,440
Are you really
that fucking crazy?

572
00:49:30,221 --> 00:49:33,622
You can't kill me,
you stupid cunt.

573
00:49:35,693 --> 00:49:37,524
I'm the Thunder Man!

574
00:49:53,278 --> 00:49:55,746
I didn't realize
we'd crossed the state line.

575
00:49:56,014 --> 00:49:58,175
Yeah, about 10 miles ago.

576
00:49:58,349 --> 00:50:01,375
It already feels better,
you know? Safer.

577
00:50:01,552 --> 00:50:03,417
I think this is gonna
turn out to be the best decision

578
00:50:03,554 --> 00:50:04,680
we've ever made.

579
00:51:43,855 --> 00:51:45,015
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!

580
00:52:07,545 --> 00:52:09,979
I've got all the thunder I need.

581
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:32,265
I was expecting Burton
to come pick me up.

582
00:52:32,603 --> 00:52:33,968
What happened?

583
00:52:34,105 --> 00:52:36,266
He's tying up some
loose ends for us.

584
00:52:36,441 --> 00:52:37,533
What loose ends?

585
00:52:50,354 --> 00:52:51,787
Who did this?

586
00:52:53,191 --> 00:52:54,556
I did.

587
00:52:55,927 --> 00:52:57,485
For you.

588
00:54:51,442 --> 00:54:52,875
Till next time.

589
00:54:58,482 --> 00:55:00,109
Till next time.

590
00:55:41,258 --> 00:55:43,055
Hey, Deva.

591
00:55:46,297 --> 00:55:47,787
Hello, Dad.

592
00:57:02,206 --> 00:57:05,664
One, two, three, four!

593
00:57:12,149 --> 00:57:13,878
Hell, yeah, bitch!

594
00:57:16,821 --> 00:57:19,483
One, two, three!

595
00:57:27,164 --> 00:57:28,722
Yeah!

596
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,852
This is Chayton.

597
00:58:03,934 --> 00:58:05,697
What is it?

598
00:58:05,903 --> 00:58:08,770
Alex Longshadow is dead.

599
00:58:08,906 --> 00:58:10,430
Pack up.

600
00:58:11,008 --> 00:58:12,441
Where we going?

601
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:14,241
Home.
