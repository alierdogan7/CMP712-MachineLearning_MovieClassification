WEEKS: Before we start, I
want you to know something.

5
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:14,583
I'm not a rat.

6
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:17,768
You understand?

7
00:01:17,913 --> 00:01:20,784
I want that on record before we start.

00:01:20,984 --> 00:01:22,034
OLSEN: Okay.

9
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:23,540
You are not a rat.

10
00:01:23,622 --> 00:01:25,796
And it's on record.

11
00:01:26,335 --> 00:01:29,012
Mr. Weeks, the charges against you...

12
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:32,397
racketeering, extortion, kidnapping,

13
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:35,366
and accomplice to
murder... are very serious.

14
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:38,190
Am I correct in stating
that you are here today

15
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:41,047
to make a deal with the federal government?

16
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,860
Correct.

17
00:01:42,892 --> 00:01:44,125
And am I correct in stating

18
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,240
that you are going from trusted confidant

19
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:51,447
to one of South Boston's most
notorious and violent gangsters

20
00:01:51,535 --> 00:01:53,871
to government witness?

21
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:55,506
Correct.

22
00:01:55,943 --> 00:01:59,236
Then I need to know everything you know

23
00:01:59,339 --> 00:02:01,412
about the Winter Hill Gang,

24
00:02:01,582 --> 00:02:03,859
the FBI and John Connolly,

25
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:08,252
and specifically, what you
know about your former boss

26
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:11,977
and now fugitive, James "Whitey" Bulger.

27
00:02:14,454 --> 00:02:15,912

We got to do it.

32
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:34,624
Sorry, buddy. I can't let you in.

33
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:36,527
That's cool, man. I'm friends with Jimmy.

- Really?
- Yeah.

35
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:38,849

- Yeah.

I'm the guy who works here.

00:02:45,688 --> 00:02:46,928
You probably don't remember this,

40
00:02:46,963 --> 00:02:49,348
but you were here last Saturday night

41
00:02:49,383 --> 00:02:50,233
with a few of your friends

42
00:02:50,268 --> 00:02:51,332
around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.

43
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:53,497
You took a piss up against the bar.

44
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:56,038
And that's frowned upon here.

45
00:02:56,073 --> 00:02:59,943
But if you go down to Brannigan's

46
00:02:59,978 --> 00:03:00,670
just right down there,

47
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:03,863
they'll let you take a shit
in the middle of the floor

48
00:03:03,898 --> 00:03:05,387
if that's what you want to do.

49

All right. Yeah.

00:03:08,972 --> 00:03:09,699
Okay?

52
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:12,418
Oh, yeah, we'll go. Hey, look.

No hard feelings, okay?

65
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,848
And Connors was fuckin' in there.

66
00:03:42,883 --> 00:03:44,969
He couldn't even look. He had to look away.

00:03:45,004 --> 00:03:48,531
Connors ain't no tough guy.
Denucci whipped his ass in 59.

68

Of course he did. He's
a professional fighter.

00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:52,042
Yeah, so's Connors.

00:03:52,077 --> 00:03:53,159
Connors is a tough kid,

71
00:03:53,194 --> 00:03:56,620
but Joe Denucci's the real
thing, it's all I'm saying.

72
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:57,994
Well, I'm saying that Connors

73
00:03:58,027 --> 00:03:59,841
didn't want no part of this broad.

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,579

what kind of fuckin' bacteria,

81
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:23,625
and then you take the same

00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:25,655
and you stuff 'em back into the bowl

OLSEN: What'd you do?

133
00:07:54,985 --> 00:07:56,505
WEEKS: The everyday, small-time stuff...

134
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,519
the rackets, driving around making pickups,

135
00:07:58,554 --> 00:08:01,539
checking on our vending machines, you know.

136
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,719
And listenin' to Mickey bullshit.

137
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:06,872
So, this guy at the Libra
Lounge in Revere over there

138
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,485
is tellin' me that the
porn stars in California,

00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:11,858
they eat a lot of celery

140
00:08:11,893 --> 00:08:13,515
before they're gonna perform, you know?

141
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,179
Wait. Whoa. Stop for a second.

142
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:17,452
That's old Mrs. Cody.

143
00:08:17,525 --> 00:08:19,698
Mickey, you remember old Mrs. Cody?

144
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:20,861
Of course I do.

145
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:23,206
Going strong. Look at her.

146
00:08:26,236 --> 00:08:27,709
Pardon me, Mrs. Cody,

147
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:29,917
but I think I smell a little shepherd's pie

148
00:08:29,952 --> 00:08:31,472
sneaking out of that bag there.

149
00:08:31,507 --> 00:08:32,191
Am I right?

150
00:08:32,226 --> 00:08:34,203
As I live and breathe, it's Jimmy!

151
00:08:34,236 --> 00:08:37,702
- It is.
- When did you get out of Alcatraz?

152
00:08:37,737 --> 00:08:41,678
Oh. Uh... that's nearly 10
years ago now, Mrs. Cody.

153
00:08:41,712 --> 00:08:43,190
- Oh.
- More than a minute.

154
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:44,446
Well, it's wonderful

155
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:46,936
to have you back in the neighborhood, son.

156
00:08:47,002 --> 00:08:48,586
You remember Mickey, don't you?

157
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:49,426
- Hello, there.
- Hi, Mickey.

158
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:51,727
How are you, sweetheart?
It's nice to see you.

00:08:51,762 --> 00:08:53,050
You know this kid, Kevin?

00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:54,257
Your paper boy, right?

161
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,069
I grew up a little bit, huh?

162
00:08:56,104 --> 00:08:58,285
Make sure everything gets put away nice.

She got everything she needs, huh?

164
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:02,032
WEEKS: The truth of the matter is,

165
00:09:02,064 --> 00:09:05,061
a lot of people in Southie loved Jimmy.

166
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:07,463
OLSEN: And you'd include
John Connolly in that group?

167
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:09,640
WEEKS: Well, especially John Connolly.

168
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:11,585
I mean, he grew up in the projects

169
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,009
a few doors down from the Bulger brothers.

170
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:15,450
He was tight with Billy,

171
00:09:15,485 --> 00:09:17,074
but like every other
kid in the neighborhood,

172
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:19,741
he was in awe of Jimmy.

173
00:09:19,822 --> 00:09:21,601
The story goes, when he was growing up,

174
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:24,026
Connolly was taking a
beating from some guys,

175
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:26,755
and Jimmy stepped in and
saved his ass, I guess.

176
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:27,967

He's a hell of a cop,
he's a straight shooter,

181
00:09:35,537 --> 00:09:37,840
and, well, we're damn lucky to have him.

182
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:38,969
Welcome, John.

183
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:41,838
[applause]

184
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:44,698
WEEKS: You know, Southie kids...

185
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:46,663
we went straight from
playing cops and robbers

186
00:09:46,698 --> 00:09:49,801
on the playground to doing
it for real in the streets.

187
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,535
And just like on the playground,

188
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,120
it wasn't always easy to tell who's who.

189
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:56,350
CONNOLLY: There he is.

190
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:58,241
Oh, John!

191
00:09:58,638 --> 00:09:59,670
How are you?

192
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:00,847
Yeah, good.

193
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:02,368
If I'm buying anyone,

194
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:04,013
- I'm buying Gary Carter.
- Gary Carter.

195
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:06,478
That kid is a star in the making.

196
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:07,755
Which is why it'll never happen.

197
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,947
Not in a million fuckin'
years. You know why?

198
00:10:09,982 --> 00:10:12,558
BOTH: Because it's the Sox.

199
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:13,987
[both chuckle]

200
00:10:14,022 --> 00:10:16,158
So, seriously, what do I call you now?

201
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:18,127
I mean, is it Billy?

202
00:10:18,253 --> 00:10:20,230
Or I got to call you Senator?

203
00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:22,642
Oh, come on. I'm the one drooling here.

204
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,311
Mr. FBI Hero.

205
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,161
[laughs]

206
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:26,722
How's the wife? How's Marianne?

207
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:28,569
Great. Can't complain.

208
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:32,051
Well, look at you. Look at you.

209
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:35,303
I haven't forgotten where we came from.

210
00:10:35,403 --> 00:10:36,910
"Don't you ever do that again.

211
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:38,813
I want to see you throw the first punch,

212
00:10:38,913 --> 00:10:40,301
and throw the first two punches."

213
00:10:40,336 --> 00:10:42,176
[both chuckle]

214
00:10:42,283 --> 00:10:45,305
Oh, man. Yeah, I got to
get down to the Old Harbor.

215
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,743
You ought to, John.

216
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:48,787
Your ma would love to see you.

217
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:51,238
How's, uh... how's your brother?

218
00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:52,369
How is Jimmy?

219
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:53,961
Jimmy's Jimmy.

220
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:55,020
You know?

221
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:55,979
Why do you ask?

222
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:57,241
Well, it's no secret

223
00:10:57,276 --> 00:10:59,910
that Southie's been a war zone lately.

224
00:10:59,955 --> 00:11:03,087
What, with 60, 70 slayings?

225
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:05,805
But your brother and his Winter Hill boys,

226
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,996
they're still out there.

227
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:09,979
They must be doing something right. Right?

228
00:11:12,194 --> 00:11:14,561
All right, John. Let's
call this what it is.

229
00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:16,201
You're jerking me off under the table

230
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,338
- to get to Jimmy.
- I'm not.

231
00:11:17,392 --> 00:11:18,988
Jimmy's business is Jimmy's business.

232
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:21,292
It sure as hell ain't none of mine.

233
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:25,569
I got an edict to eradicate the Mafia.

234
00:11:25,723 --> 00:11:28,432
And I know that Jimmy and Stephen Flemmi

235
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:30,431
are musclin' in on their numbers rackets

236
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:32,919
and their vending machines.

237
00:11:33,003 --> 00:11:35,908
And I know that this ain't
sitting very well with Angiulo.

238
00:11:35,943 --> 00:11:36,737
I don't want to hear this.

239
00:11:36,772 --> 00:11:38,841
You need to hear this, Billy.

240
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:41,335
Your brother...

241
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,502
is wading in some very dark waters.

242
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:52,901
You know... we all need friends.

243
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:55,972
Even Jimmy.

244
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:57,731
Even you.

245
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,399
Nobody gets there on their own.

246
00:12:00,434 --> 00:12:02,357
Ain't that right, Senator?

247
00:12:03,713 --> 00:12:05,280
You know what, John?

248
00:12:05,536 --> 00:12:07,453
It's good to see you doing so well.

249
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:08,882
Really, it is.

250
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:11,214
Give my regards to the boys at the Plaza.

251
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:13,071
Listen, you don't want to
give that to Jimmy, fine.

252
00:12:13,106 --> 00:12:19,796
But just tell him I
said... hello, and I'm back.

253
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:21,292
Oh, if Jimmy wants to get in touch,

254
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:23,835
he'll find you. Trust me.

255
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:26,235
You ought to come over to dinner sometime.

256
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:28,699
Mary and the kids would love to see you.

257
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,551
Robert, how are things?

258
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:32,151
How are you, Senator?

259
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:33,754
Good to see you.

260
00:12:42,421 --> 00:12:45,032
Oh, there she is.

261
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:47,421
Agent Marianne.

262
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,568
Hands where I can see 'em.

263
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:52,933
Looks good. You're making progress.

264
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:54,962
Well, thank you, Agent Connolly.

265
00:12:54,997 --> 00:12:56,287
Did you save Boston yet?

266
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:57,670
[grumbles]

267
00:12:57,705 --> 00:12:59,717
It's early, but I'm working on it.

268
00:12:59,752 --> 00:13:02,169
You better work hard, because
Hoover's expecting big things

269
00:13:02,237 --> 00:13:04,339
from his favorite son.

270
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:06,704
He won't be disappointed.

271
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:07,641
Oh, is that so?

272
00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:09,679
[laughs]

273
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:14,386
[siren wails]

274
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,126
Hey, little thief.

275
00:13:24,686 --> 00:13:26,922
What are you doing? I know what you want.

276
00:13:26,957 --> 00:13:30,361
- Jimmy? Is that you?
- What you looking for?

277
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:31,966
Good morning, Ma.

278
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:34,457
How was work?

279
00:13:34,544 --> 00:13:37,319
It was long. I got to get
some sleep, sweetheart.

280
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,780
How we doin', huh?

281
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:40,880
All right, hey.

282
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:43,754
You still owe me $56.

283
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,477
What do you say? Hmm?

284
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:47,322
All right, one hand, huh?

285
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:48,638
- One hand.
- Ah, yeah, yeah.

286
00:13:48,673 --> 00:13:51,567
And $56 is still a lot of money, Jimmy.

287
00:13:51,602 --> 00:13:53,116
Oh, don't I know it.

288
00:13:53,151 --> 00:13:55,006
You gonna cheat me again
or you gonna play straight?

289
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:58,335
Ah, look who's talkin'. Cheat.

290
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:01,555
Ah, Jimmy... get the jacket off.

291
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:02,687
Here we go.

292
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:21,832
Gin.

293
00:14:21,906 --> 00:14:24,198
Come on! Not again.

294
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:27,053
You're not paying attention.

295
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:29,157
Can't you see I'm after hearts?

296
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:32,135
And you just keep feeding me hearts!

297
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,614
Billy, I'm getting creamed over here.

298
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:34,379
Better you than me, pal.

299
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:36,356
Did you learn nothing in prison?

300
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:40,067
Oh, all those hours and no
one taught you how to play gin.

301
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,270
Well, they didn't teach me
how to cheat against my mom.

302
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:45,795
Look, here's my cards. Count 'em out.

303
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,705
Hey, Ma, did you know old Mother
Burke died over on Baker Street?

304
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,647
No one found her for a couple of weeks.

305
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,082
That's right.

306
00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:55,117
And when they broke down the door,

307
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:58,310
her cats had devoured the best part of her.

308
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:02,177
That's... that's beautiful, Ma.

309
00:15:02,212 --> 00:15:03,191
Who's hungry?

310
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:05,965
I'm out. I got creamed,
I'm going to take a nap.

311
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,340
Thanks for cheating, Ma.

312
00:15:07,394 --> 00:15:09,196
See you later.

313
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,769
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Yeah?

314
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:15,406
Do you remember little John Connolly?

315
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:16,485
Yeah, why? What's up?

316
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,857
He's an FBI agent now. He's come back home.

Connolly.

324
00:15:48,316 --> 00:15:49,734
I'm on my way.

325
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:31,783
Hey, Jimmy. It's good to see you.

326
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:35,593
The fuckin' FBI, John?

327
00:16:38,632 --> 00:16:40,723
You got two minutes.

328
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:43,463
All right, I'm gonna cut right to it.

329
00:16:45,274 --> 00:16:47,662
I... I have it on very good authority

330
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:52,219
that Gennaro Angiulo is
planning to have you murdered.

331
00:16:52,937 --> 00:16:54,211
Is that so?

332
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:57,538
And how does he plan to achieve that?

333
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,674
That's the kind of
information that my side gets.

334
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,033
And that's the kind of
information that we can provide.

335
00:17:05,219 --> 00:17:06,995
John, do you know what I do to rats?

336
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,433
It ain't rattin', Jimmy.

337
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,853
It's an alliance.

338
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,917
An alliance between me and the fuckin' FBI?

339
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:17,056
No, no, between you and me.

340
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:22,181
I can help you, Jimmy, and you can help me.

341
00:17:22,464 --> 00:17:25,794
Listen, the whole fucking game has changed.

342
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,316
And I'm not trying to clean up Southie.

343
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:32,003
Fuck that! I fuckin' love this place.

344
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:34,350
I'm interested in the North End

345
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:37,123
and taking down the fuckin' WOPs.

346
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:40,602
I'm interested in the Mafia,
and I bet you are, too.

That's two minutes.

348

Yeah.

- No.

- You don't want me to wake him up?
- No!

00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,217
Jimmy, don't wake him up.

360
00:18:56,252 --> 00:18:58,885
I'll be sore if you wake him up.

361
00:18:58,953 --> 00:19:00,400
I'm gonna go wake him up now.

362
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:02,657
- Don't wake him up.
- Wakin' him up.

363
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:26,563
Hey, buddy. Got a question for you.

364
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:31,796
What are you gonna do
with the rest of that?

365
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:33,229
Not drink it.

366
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:35,958
No, buddy, you got to
drink every drop of that.

367
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:37,510
You know why?

368
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,324
That is pure vitamin C,

369
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:43,016
and it's freshly squeezed by your mommy,

370
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:47,674
which is, obviously, makes it
more special, even magical-like.

371
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:51,375
It's true. Go on. Put it away.

372
00:19:52,754 --> 00:19:54,311
Good boy.

373
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:56,922
So...

374
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:01,618
do you feel like, maybe,
you want to tell me

375
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:03,940
what happened in school yesterday?

376
00:20:11,818 --> 00:20:14,767
Oh, I remember. Something did happen.

377
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,740
Yeah? What happened?

378
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:20,579
Timmy. He's the kid who's
always trying to trip me.

379
00:20:20,672 --> 00:20:22,835
And he stole my coloring
pencils off my desk

380
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,603
when my back was turned.

381
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:26,691
So I punched him in the face.

382
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:27,888
Good boy.

383
00:20:27,923 --> 00:20:29,125
LINDSEY: Jimmy.

384
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,454
Hey.

385
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,152
Let me ask you a question...

386
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:33,912
is that why you think you got in trouble?

387
00:20:33,947 --> 00:20:36,504
'Cause you punched him in the face?

388
00:20:37,484 --> 00:20:38,354
All right.

389
00:20:38,396 --> 00:20:40,548
I need you to listen very
carefully to what I'm sayin'

390
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,563
because there are lessons again and again

391
00:20:42,611 --> 00:20:44,724
throughout your whole life.

392
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:47,561
You got to learn from these things, right?

393
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:49,334
Here's the deal...

394
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:52,136
you did not get in trouble

395
00:20:52,204 --> 00:20:54,682
because you punched this
sneaky brat in the face.

396
00:20:54,717 --> 00:20:55,981
Not at all.

397
00:20:56,016 --> 00:20:57,954
You got in trouble

398
00:20:58,052 --> 00:21:01,200
because you punched this
sneaky little brat in the face

399
00:21:01,235 --> 00:21:03,184
in front of other people.

400
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:04,258
[sighs]

401
00:21:04,605 --> 00:21:06,149
Jimmy?

402
00:21:06,488 --> 00:21:08,063
I really don't think that
that's the right thing

403
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,999
to be teaching your kid.

404
00:21:10,155 --> 00:21:15,523
No, that's absolutely what I
should be tellin' him, babe.

405
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,554
So, the lesson you got to learn is this...

406
00:21:19,192 --> 00:21:20,814
it's not what you do,

407
00:21:20,876 --> 00:21:22,439
it's when and where you do it,

408
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,393
and who you do it to or with.

409
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:28,227
Huh? You follow?

410
00:21:28,281 --> 00:21:30,179
Yes, I follow.

411
00:21:30,276 --> 00:21:32,397
Punch people when no one's looking.

412
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,927
- That's exactly right.
- [chuckles nervously]

413
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:38,653
If nobody sees it,

414
00:21:38,808 --> 00:21:40,577
it didn't happen.

415
00:21:42,216 --> 00:21:44,848
[police radio chatter]

416
00:21:44,883 --> 00:21:47,922
[siren wails]

417
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,352
Well, look what crawled out of the gutter.

418
00:22:02,435 --> 00:22:04,747
Good afternoon, Officer Flynn.

419
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:07,636
What happened? I must
have been doing 30 in a 25.

420
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:09,408
Gonna lock me up for life or somethin'?

421
00:22:09,443 --> 00:22:10,756
TOMMY: Why don't you do your fucking job

422
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,454
instead of trying to jerk off on
us, you pathetic fuckin' stiff?

423
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:16,285
- All right, Tommy. Tommy!
- I'm doing my fuckin' job.

424
00:22:16,332 --> 00:22:19,395
I'm sure the officer
didn't stop us by accident.

425
00:22:19,482 --> 00:22:21,297
You wouldn't happen to
be carrying a message,

426
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:22,896
now, would you?

427
00:22:22,957 --> 00:22:28,119
In fact, I am. Gerry
Angiulo sends his regards.

428
00:22:28,218 --> 00:22:30,210
Says he doesn't like finding
his boys beat to a pulp

429
00:22:30,276 --> 00:22:32,471
and left for dead in empty parking lots.

430
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:33,253
He also said he's confident

431
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:35,190
you ain't gonna cause him any more troubles

432
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:38,391
'cause if you do, it's only gonna
cause much worse troubles for you.

433
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:39,764
Listen, motherfucker.

434
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,406
You think 'cause you're
wearing a fucking uniform,

435
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:42,262
you can do what you want?

436
00:22:42,323 --> 00:22:44,253
- Go fuck yourself!
- Tommy!

437
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,928
- Fuck you!
- Tommy, close the fucking door.

438
00:22:47,294 --> 00:22:49,603
I got to tell you something, Officer Flynn.

439
00:22:49,638 --> 00:22:52,624
It's a sad day when a native son

440
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:54,591
takes up with his oppressor.

441
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,586
There's a word for that
back home, you know.

442
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,444
Penalty's death.

443
00:22:59,604 --> 00:23:01,010
You threatenin' me, Bulger?

444
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:03,702
The last thing I would do
if I was planning to harm you

445
00:23:03,737 --> 00:23:06,249
is to warn you in advance, you dumb fuck.

446
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,887
You better watch yourself, Bulger.

447
00:23:07,922 --> 00:23:09,552
You better fuck yourself, Flynn.

448
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:13,224
Fuck you, you project rat.
And fuck you, you rummy.

449
00:23:20,617 --> 00:23:22,610
_

450
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:28,202
TOMMY: I never trusted
Flynn. He's a fucking prick.

451
00:23:28,348 --> 00:23:29,422
LEONARD: Take it easy, will you?

452
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:31,924
Even as kids, he was a fuckin' prick!

453
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:33,267
A fuckin' prick.

454
00:23:33,302 --> 00:23:34,773
Please, calm down.

455
00:23:34,893 --> 00:23:37,051
Swear to God, I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.

456
00:23:37,086 --> 00:23:38,445
I'll fucking kill that Flynn.

457
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,641
Take it easy, will you?

458
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,018
Cock-sucking, turncoat motherfucker.

459
00:23:43,053 --> 00:23:44,178
He's fucking dead!

460
00:23:44,249 --> 00:23:46,111
JIMMY: You're not fuckin'
killing anybody, Tommy,

461
00:23:46,172 --> 00:23:48,525
and you ain't killing a cop any time.

462
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,762
You hear me?

463
00:23:53,188 --> 00:23:54,501
Fuck you, Whitey.

464
00:23:54,536 --> 00:23:56,723
Oh, Jesus. Tommy...

465
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:59,852
- Go fuck yourself.
- Come on. Enough.

466
00:23:59,912 --> 00:24:01,817
Huh?

467
00:24:01,996 --> 00:24:02,560
Fuck you.

468
00:24:02,595 --> 00:24:04,408
Take it easy. Take it easy, come on.

469
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:06,404
You want to take a shot, Tommy?

470
00:24:06,454 --> 00:24:08,343
- Enough.
- Take your shot.

471
00:24:08,396 --> 00:24:09,472
But make it your fucking best,

472
00:24:09,507 --> 00:24:11,095
'cause I get up, I eat you.

473
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:13,022
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Let's go. Come on.

474
00:24:13,057 --> 00:24:14,594
Relax. Jimmy, he's shit-faced.

475
00:24:14,634 --> 00:24:15,995
- I'll deal with him.
- Fuckin' better.

476
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,577
- Don't even worry about it.
- What, you think I look fucking worried?

477
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,333
Sit down. Please, sit down.

478
00:24:19,368 --> 00:24:22,939
Jesus Christ, he's fuckin' retarded.

479
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:26,287
Jack-o! Give me another one, huh?

480
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:28,046
Hey, Tommy.

481
00:24:28,181 --> 00:24:29,255
Yeah?

482
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:31,340
You watch yourself.

483
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:35,840
OLSEN: Mr. Martorano,

484
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,884
you are one of the most
feared men in Boston

485
00:24:38,984 --> 00:24:41,354
and well-known as the chief executioner

486
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:43,034
for the Winter Hill Gang.

487
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:44,613
Is that correct?

488
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:45,834
Yes.

489
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,697
You are also reputed to
have murdered some 20 people.

490
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,848
Would you say that is accurate?

491
00:24:52,936 --> 00:24:55,299
That is accurate, yes.

492
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:58,557
Mr. Martorano, I want you
to be as specific as possible

493
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:01,835
in answering why the
war between the Angiulos

494
00:25:01,982 --> 00:25:04,478
and Winter Hill escalated.

495
00:25:04,591 --> 00:25:06,985
Simple. Territory.

496
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,299
Specifically South Boston?

497
00:25:09,412 --> 00:25:11,336
Yes, Southie.

498
00:25:12,361 --> 00:25:14,460
Angiulo wanted to control everything...

499
00:25:14,521 --> 00:25:18,089
loan-sharking, vending
machines, all the rackets.

500
00:25:18,442 --> 00:25:20,807
And there were consequences.

501
00:25:20,984 --> 00:25:21,710
Yeah.

502
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,225
There was consequences.

503
00:25:25,216 --> 00:25:26,292
What the fuck?!

504
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:28,163
[gunshots]

505
00:25:42,046 --> 00:25:43,718
MAN: Don't worry about it!

506
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,396
JIMMY: Tommy!

507
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,103
Yeah. Fellas.

508
00:25:48,402 --> 00:25:50,697
We need you. We're looking for Suitcase.

509
00:25:50,744 --> 00:25:53,570
Suitcase? The fuck did he do?

510
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:56,437
He set up Mickey.

511
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:58,905
Fuck me.

512
00:26:00,317 --> 00:26:02,050
Hang on a minute.

513
00:26:02,345 --> 00:26:03,953
Hey, what's going on, Jimmy?

514
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,379
You guys looking for Suitcase?

515
00:26:06,414 --> 00:26:08,312
I seen him up on Winter
Hill a few hours ago.

516
00:26:08,347 --> 00:26:09,690
Need me to jump in?

517
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:12,175
Nah, we got it, buddy.

518
00:26:12,693 --> 00:26:14,767
FLEMMI: What the fuck are you doing, Tommy?

519
00:26:14,835 --> 00:26:17,200
It's a fuckin' vest. You
got a problem with it?

520
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,841
[engine turns over]

521
00:26:21,895 --> 00:26:23,734
Makes you look like a faggot.

522
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:24,645
We'll see who the faggot is

523
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,020
when it stops a couple of fuckin' bullets.

524
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,577
TOMMY: Hey, Jimmy, about that bullshit

525
00:26:47,612 --> 00:26:48,720
the other night at Triple O's,

526
00:26:48,755 --> 00:26:51,635
I was... I was fucking way out of line.

527
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:53,955
Forget about it, Tommy. You was drunk.

528
00:26:54,042 --> 00:26:57,321
I know I was drunk, but
that ain't an excuse.

529
00:26:57,356 --> 00:26:58,179
Should never have fuckin' happened.

530
00:26:58,227 --> 00:26:59,815
No, it should never have happened.

531
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,597
But that's the thing.

532
00:27:01,692 --> 00:27:03,934
I want you to listen to me.

533
00:27:04,002 --> 00:27:06,399
- You need to keep an eye on it
- Yeah.

534
00:27:06,434 --> 00:27:08,562
because, you know, the juice,

535
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:10,362
it'll sneak up and bite you on the ass,

536
00:27:10,438 --> 00:27:12,368
and you never know when,
you know what I mean?

537
00:27:12,403 --> 00:27:16,215
- Absolutely, absolutely.
- And I worry about you, that's all.

538
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:18,220
- I'll keep an eye on it, I promise.
- Huh?

539
00:27:18,255 --> 00:27:19,593
I promise.

540
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:21,547
We good?

541
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:23,292
Yeah, we're good.

542
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:30,831
Lots of good your vest did
you today, you fucking prick.

543
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,932
Put him in the trunk.

544
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,449
OLSEN: Why'd they kill Tommy?

545
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,548
WEEKS: I think Jim was convinced

546
00:27:42,588 --> 00:27:45,372
that Tommy ratted out Mickey to Angiulo.

547
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:48,111
Either that or Tommy
raising a fist to Jimmy,

548
00:27:48,146 --> 00:27:51,019
which is never a good idea.

549
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:52,764
Where'd they bury him?

550
00:27:52,856 --> 00:27:55,353
In Jim's favorite spot.

551
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,326
Right there under the
bridge in Neponset River.

552
00:27:59,742 --> 00:28:01,895
He buried so many bodies in that shithole,

553
00:28:01,977 --> 00:28:06,610
it became known as the
Bulger Burial Ground.

554
00:28:08,443 --> 00:28:10,912
I don't know how you fuckers didn't get it.

555
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:13,697
I really don't. I mean, in the beginning,

556
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:15,213
Jim was a small-town player

557
00:28:15,254 --> 00:28:18,040
who really only mattered in Southie.

558
00:28:18,214 --> 00:28:20,456
Don't get me wrong... he
was a tough motherfucker,

559
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:23,347
but small-time.

560
00:28:23,597 --> 00:28:26,529
And then the next thing you
know, he's a goddamn kingpin.

561
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,464
You know why?

562
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:31,304
Because the FBI let it happen.

563
00:28:31,465 --> 00:28:34,202
[telephone ringing]

564
00:28:40,696 --> 00:28:42,083
CONNOLLY: This is John.

565
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:44,102
Connolly.

566
00:28:45,115 --> 00:28:46,249
Jimmy.

567
00:28:46,282 --> 00:28:48,909
CONNOLLY: This is potentially
the biggest opportunity

568
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:50,446
the Bureau will ever have had

569
00:28:50,518 --> 00:28:52,791
in the history of the city of Boston,

570
00:28:52,826 --> 00:28:54,331
and you need time to think about it?

571
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:57,232
Before you go flying any
further off the handle,

572
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,341
it might help to recall that
Whitey Bulger is an ex-convict

573
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:04,650
and that his parole category
is "supervised released status,"

574
00:29:04,685 --> 00:29:07,562
a designation that we would
be required to get withdrawn

575
00:29:07,597 --> 00:29:10,654
or else we would be in
violation of Bureau regulations.

576
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:13,037
So? We withdraw or we violate.

577
00:29:13,072 --> 00:29:15,741
What we don't do, unless
we're clinically insane,

578
00:29:15,776 --> 00:29:17,891
is blow this chance!

579
00:29:18,693 --> 00:29:21,664
By the way, it's "Jimmy," not "Whitey."

580
00:29:21,699 --> 00:29:22,563
The only thing you're gonna get

581
00:29:22,598 --> 00:29:24,952
by calling him Whitey is a fucking smack.

582
00:29:24,987 --> 00:29:26,355
Oh, is that so?

583
00:29:26,455 --> 00:29:28,865
So I'm supposed to cater
to this fucker's whims?

584
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,278
If it brings you Angiulo, yes!

585
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,574
And what makes you so sure

586
00:29:33,623 --> 00:29:35,120
that he's gonna be a reliable source?

587
00:29:35,155 --> 00:29:36,505
Because in my experience,

588
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,824
everyone of those Winter Hill pricks

589
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,940
is a double-crossing cocksucker.

590
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:42,148
I grew up with him in Southie.

591
00:29:42,475 --> 00:29:45,739
Jimmy, his brother Billy, and me.

592
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:49,433
And that is a bond that doesn't get broken.

593
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:52,614
I mean, if he gives me
his word, he will keep it.

594
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:55,117
So we're relying on the word of criminals.

595
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,070
Jimmy's no ordinary criminal.

596
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,952
Well, you're right about that.

597
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,455
"A vicious animal who won't
take no for an answer."

598
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:05,943
"Violent decisiveness
at any hint of betrayal."

599
00:30:06,073 --> 00:30:06,943
Oh!

600
00:30:06,978 --> 00:30:10,348
"A ripened psychopath determined
to succeed above all else."

601
00:30:10,383 --> 00:30:12,206
I got a lot of respect for you, Charles,

602
00:30:12,241 --> 00:30:15,427
but I cannot fucking
believe what I'm hearing.

603
00:30:15,495 --> 00:30:18,327
Four Mafia murders in the
North End this month alone,

604
00:30:18,362 --> 00:30:20,976
and we don't have a
legitimate case on any of them.

605
00:30:21,011 --> 00:30:22,578
The Angiulos are out there laughing at us

606
00:30:22,652 --> 00:30:25,354
like we're fuckin' a bunch of clowns!

607
00:30:25,452 --> 00:30:27,835
A bunch of clowns!

608
00:30:27,902 --> 00:30:28,784
Come on, guys.

609
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:32,361
If we're serious about
bringing down the Italians,

610
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:34,123
Jimmy is the only way.

611
00:30:34,156 --> 00:30:36,290
What about these LSD experiments in prison?

612
00:30:36,325 --> 00:30:37,543
He can't be stable.

613
00:30:37,578 --> 00:30:39,320
He did it for time off and money.

614
00:30:39,355 --> 00:30:40,805
And it was a handful of times.

615
00:30:40,866 --> 00:30:43,340
It was 50 times, John.

616
00:30:44,774 --> 00:30:46,623
Just trust me when I tell you

617
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:51,027
he is a smart, stable motherfucker.

618
00:30:53,373 --> 00:30:55,426
What do you think, Morris?

619
00:30:58,698 --> 00:31:02,620
I think that we have more
to gain than to lose on this.

620
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:04,583
I think we go with John.

621
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:09,089
I think we bring Whitey...
uh, Jimmy, into the tent.

622
00:31:16,296 --> 00:31:20,088
No drugs. No fuckin' murder, Connolly.

623
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:25,981
_

624
00:31:30,061 --> 00:31:31,816
_

625
00:31:34,578 --> 00:31:36,285
_

626
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:46,730
JIMMY: You listen good, 'cause
I'm only gonna say this once.

627
00:31:46,954 --> 00:31:50,552
I will never hurt or adversely affect

628
00:31:50,587 --> 00:31:53,716
any of my friends or financial partners.

629
00:31:53,815 --> 00:31:57,740
I do not consider this
rattin' or informin'.

630
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,161
This is business.

631
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:01,221
I couldn't have said it any better.

632
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:03,201
You're a liaison.

633
00:32:03,335 --> 00:32:05,666
- You pretty much do whatever you want.
- _

634
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,100
And no one's gonna raise an eyebrow

635
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:10,261
so long as you're leadin' us
into some pretty big busts.

636
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:11,637
There's just one restriction

637
00:32:11,672 --> 00:32:13,150
- on our side...
- _

638
00:32:14,413 --> 00:32:17,078
you can't kill anybody, Jimmy.

639
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:23,612
OLSEN: Kevin, did you know
that Whitey was an informant?

640
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:25,613
WEEKS: No, I didn't know.

641
00:32:25,719 --> 00:32:27,354
I mean, he hated rats.

642
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,680
We fuckin' buried rats, especially our own.

643
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:33,220
I mean, I knew he had his
connections in the FBI.

644
00:32:33,255 --> 00:32:34,422
I knew he had his sources.

645
00:32:34,482 --> 00:32:36,089
But I figured he was playing them

646
00:32:36,124 --> 00:32:37,992
like he did everybody else.

647
00:32:38,467 --> 00:32:41,203
But obviously, he had a plan.

648
00:32:41,238 --> 00:32:42,217
[police radio chatter]

649
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:45,088
[Jimmy grunting]

650
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:48,148
Where do you get the
energy for that shit, Jimmy?

651
00:32:50,358 --> 00:32:52,799
Hey, Steve. Hang on a minute.

652
00:32:54,716 --> 00:32:57,299
We've known each other a long fuckin' time.

653
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,774
Can I trust you, Stevie?

654
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:05,710
You know you can trust me.

655
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:07,292
Good.

656
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:10,314
'Cause there's something
I want you to know.

657
00:33:12,806 --> 00:33:15,041
I'm making a deal with the Feds.

658
00:33:15,838 --> 00:33:17,607
An alliance.

659
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:19,636
You're informing to the FBI?

660
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:23,436
No. There's informing, and
then there's <i>informing.</i>

661
00:33:23,562 --> 00:33:26,266
Informing, you should be fucking chopped up

662
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:28,568
and put into a garbage bag, that's it.

663
00:33:28,642 --> 00:33:30,499
Informing, you're the scum of the scum.

664
00:33:30,547 --> 00:33:33,275
But it's not informing

665
00:33:33,355 --> 00:33:35,984
when you're bringing down the cocksuckers

666
00:33:36,085 --> 00:33:38,827
who deserve to be brought down...

667
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,472
like the fucking Brits in the six counties

668
00:33:41,537 --> 00:33:44,943
or the goddamn Dagos up in the North End.

669
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,276
It's a business opportunity.

670
00:33:47,311 --> 00:33:51,216
Get the FBI to fight our wars

671
00:33:51,627 --> 00:33:54,309
against our enemies...

672
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:56,796
while they protect us,

673
00:33:56,857 --> 00:33:59,694
and we do whatever the fuck we want to do.

674
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,260
All right, Jimmy.

675
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:20,795
There's a guy named John Connolly.

676
00:34:21,003 --> 00:34:23,052
He's a Southie boy. We grew up together.

677
00:34:23,087 --> 00:34:24,211
He's all right.

678
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:28,374
[siren wails]

679
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:30,415
So, we're doing this?

680
00:34:30,564 --> 00:34:32,934
Yeah, we're gonna do this.

681
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:04,796
Ho-ho-ho!

682
00:35:05,054 --> 00:35:08,411
Shh, he's asleep. He's a little sick.

683
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:12,548
He's a little sick? Sick with what?

684
00:35:12,686 --> 00:35:14,546
He's just got a fever.

685
00:35:14,665 --> 00:35:17,607
He'll be fine in a few days.
It's probably just the flu.

686
00:35:17,735 --> 00:35:19,999
Did you take him to the doctor?

687
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,171
No, he'll be okay.

688
00:35:23,345 --> 00:35:26,282
Take him to the doctor
in the morning, would you?

689
00:35:46,765 --> 00:35:48,263
BILLY: It's only a little,
but it might get bigger

690
00:35:48,298 --> 00:35:50,747
because the hose, at this time of the year,

691
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,916
it's always leaking
and bursting, that pipe.

692
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,780
You want me to get Tom to fix it?

693
00:35:54,867 --> 00:35:57,412
Sure. It's nice of you, Billy, thank you.

694
00:35:57,445 --> 00:36:00,381
No worries. No worries.

695
00:36:00,436 --> 00:36:03,705
Marianne, how are you
settling into Southie?

696
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,918
How do you find it?

697
00:36:04,953 --> 00:36:05,953
I like it.

698
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,465
It's taking a little getting used to,

699
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,253
but... it's different.

700
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,428
Different how?

701
00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:15,064
I find it a rather tight-knit community.

702
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:18,181
And I could have hoped to have
met a few more people by now.

703
00:36:18,308 --> 00:36:20,717
You know, those sort of
things just take a little time

704
00:36:20,752 --> 00:36:23,312
and you need introductions to people.

705
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,904
Mary and I can help with
that. Can't we, Mary?

706
00:36:24,952 --> 00:36:26,437
MARY: Yeah, indeed we can, Bill.

707
00:36:26,508 --> 00:36:28,205
- That would be great, thank you.
- Once you settle in,

708
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,644
you'll find that people around
here are as good as gold.

709
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:31,868
I'm sure that's true.

710
00:36:31,903 --> 00:36:33,456

it's Reye's syndrome.

- I thought it was the flu.
- [crying] I know, so did I.

745
00:38:02,961 --> 00:38:04,838
But then when you left,
I called the doctor,

746
00:38:04,873 --> 00:38:06,829
and they said to just
keep giving him aspirin

I'd been doing for days.

Like, really angry, and
his body was all stiff,

753
00:38:21,812 --> 00:38:23,103
so I brought him here, and they said

754
00:38:23,138 --> 00:38:27,730
that the aspirin that I had been
giving him just made him worse.

755
00:38:28,017 --> 00:38:29,993
- No. No.

We were making a lot of money.

But my question to you is,

838
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,458
have they actually given us
one concrete fucking thing

839
00:44:01,493 --> 00:44:02,315

All right, you fucking listen to me, John.

We have given Bulger
miles and miles of leeway,

00:44:13,298 --> 00:44:16,421

of fucking Keystone Cops.

887
00:46:14,341 --> 00:46:17,544
right before you put your
keys into the ignition,

888
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:20,787
maybe have a look in the glove box.

889
00:46:24,203 --> 00:46:26,270
There just might be an
early Christmas present

890
00:46:26,305 --> 00:46:28,118
in there for you.

891
00:46:43,851 --> 00:46:44,952
What's this?

892
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:47,360
Gentlemen, this is intel,

893
00:46:47,395 --> 00:46:50,059
from our source in Winter Hill.

894
00:46:52,454 --> 00:46:53,589
FITZPATRICK: Holy shit.

895
00:46:53,624 --> 00:46:55,569
98 Prince Street.

896
00:46:55,707 --> 00:46:58,105
Angiulo Family headquarters.

897
00:46:58,197 --> 00:46:59,054
Fuck me.

898
00:46:59,089 --> 00:47:02,243
Yeah, "fuck me" and fuck you is right.

899
00:47:02,516 --> 00:47:06,041
An hour ago, I got a
wet shave in a barbershop

900
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:09,741
right across from 98 Prince
in the heart of the North End,

901
00:47:09,835 --> 00:47:13,662
and within 15 minutes, I saw Mikey Angiulo,

902
00:47:13,726 --> 00:47:17,252
Bobby Carozza, and one
Vincent "The Animal" Ferrara

903
00:47:17,287 --> 00:47:19,585
- all go inside.
- Jesus, John.

904
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:23,357
Do you want to talk about
who's a valuable asset, Charles?

905
00:47:23,582 --> 00:47:25,215
In five fucking years of nobodies

906
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:27,443
with Scotch on their
breath giving us shit...

907
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:29,117
not a goddamn thing.

908
00:47:29,152 --> 00:47:30,659
And giving them 40 bucks
to go around the corner

909
00:47:30,694 --> 00:47:32,087
and get drunk and dick us around?

910
00:47:32,148 --> 00:47:34,423
Fuck that. This, on the other hand,

911
00:47:34,489 --> 00:47:35,913
is the kind of intel we get

912
00:47:35,948 --> 00:47:39,984
from James "Whitey" Bulger, gentlemen.

913
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:41,937
No one else.

914
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,911
FLEMMI: Jimmy always had a plan.

915
00:48:04,998 --> 00:48:08,870
Like him giving up Angiulo's
address at 98 Prince Street.

916
00:48:09,077 --> 00:48:11,372
Now, that was a smart play

917
00:48:11,407 --> 00:48:17,603
because it kept Connolly,
you know, off our backs.

918
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,298
We had stuff going on in Florida.

919
00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:22,681
Situation down there was changing,

920
00:48:22,756 --> 00:48:24,888
and not for the better.

921
00:48:25,257 --> 00:48:28,093
CHAIRMAN: World Jai Alai would
like to introduce its new owner,

922
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,168
C.E.O. and Chief Operating
Officer Roger Wheeler.

923
00:48:32,222 --> 00:48:34,521
- Roger?
- Thank you, Alan.

924
00:48:34,716 --> 00:48:36,670
It's an exciting time for Jai Alai,

925
00:48:36,735 --> 00:48:38,586
and I'm honored to be part of its growth

926
00:48:38,637 --> 00:48:40,991
and expansion here in South Florida.

927
00:48:41,112 --> 00:48:44,819
John Callahan has us
poised for great success.

928
00:48:45,898 --> 00:48:48,353
FLEMMI: I can't believe
people pay to watch this shit.

929
00:48:48,435 --> 00:48:50,360
Well, they fucking love it, Stevie.

930
00:48:50,425 --> 00:48:52,291
They fucking love to bet on it.

931
00:48:52,326 --> 00:48:54,315
That's making us very rich.

932
00:48:54,455 --> 00:48:57,016
But who knows for how much
longer with Wheeler moving in?

933
00:48:57,084 --> 00:48:59,734
Guy's a fucking double-barreled prick.

934
00:48:59,791 --> 00:49:01,732
But at least we still got this.

935
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:04,021
Oh, no, no, no. You give
that to Kevin, not me.

936
00:49:04,056 --> 00:49:05,273
All right.

937
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,078
FLEMMI: So, what's the
problem with this Wheeler guy?

938
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:12,156
What's his deal?

939
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:15,463
He's got CPAs crawling all up my ass,

940
00:49:15,515 --> 00:49:17,943
all over the books,
checking every fucking thing.

941
00:49:17,978 --> 00:49:21,002
The cash flow, the free meals,
the parking-lot receipts.

942
00:49:21,102 --> 00:49:22,988
Just a matter of time before he finds out

943
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:24,448
how much cash is missing.

944
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:26,880
Just make him an offer for the company.

945
00:49:26,915 --> 00:49:29,132
Tried. Won't sell.

946
00:49:29,362 --> 00:49:31,522
Would his widow sell?

947
00:49:35,805 --> 00:49:37,650
FLEMMI: Maybe she could be persuaded.

948
00:49:37,685 --> 00:49:41,541
Maybe balloonhead over here...
you could do us a favor.

949
00:49:41,576 --> 00:49:43,642
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

950
00:49:43,802 --> 00:49:44,639
Sure.

951
00:49:44,674 --> 00:49:46,374
Whatever you say, Stevie.

952
00:49:46,407 --> 00:49:48,470
But, you know, there
must be some other way.

953
00:49:48,538 --> 00:49:50,113
Yeah, but you don't get rid of him,

954
00:49:50,181 --> 00:49:52,303
how's he supposed to go away?

955
00:49:52,449 --> 00:49:54,827
What's the downside of this thing, John?

956
00:49:54,862 --> 00:49:56,643
There is no downside, Stevie.

957
00:49:56,678 --> 00:50:00,076
And the upside is, we get our
cut and keep printing money.

958
00:50:00,213 --> 00:50:01,288
I mean, what's to connect you

959
00:50:01,322 --> 00:50:02,926
to anything that happens to Wheeler?

960
00:50:02,987 --> 00:50:05,728
He lives in Tulsa, for fuck's sake!

961
00:50:06,885 --> 00:50:10,505
Everybody knows we have World Jai Alai.

962
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,121
Who's "everybody"?

963
00:50:12,156 --> 00:50:14,320
We're fucking everybody.

964
00:50:14,787 --> 00:50:16,124
Brian.

965
00:50:17,363 --> 00:50:19,732
Take the bag. I want you to have it.

966
00:50:22,343 --> 00:50:24,763
Yeah. I want you to have it.

967
00:50:25,056 --> 00:50:26,101
No.

968
00:50:26,136 --> 00:50:27,460
Lot of money in that bag, Jimmy.

969
00:50:27,521 --> 00:50:30,215
I know exactly how much
money's in that fucking bag.

970
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,487
Brian, take the bag and get out of here.

971
00:50:34,665 --> 00:50:36,968
To do the hit on... on Wheeler?

972
00:50:37,014 --> 00:50:38,022
No.

973
00:50:38,057 --> 00:50:43,598
That's $20,000 for you
to <i>not</i> do the hit.

974
00:50:44,131 --> 00:50:45,364
[chuckles]

975
00:50:46,759 --> 00:50:48,241
I don't get it.

976
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:50,238
Take the money, keep
your fucking mouth shut

977
00:50:50,271 --> 00:50:51,713
about what you just heard.

978
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:55,130
It's best you're not involved.
Take the fucking money.

979
00:50:55,165 --> 00:50:59,101
Take the fucking money.
Take the fucking money.

980
00:51:00,427 --> 00:51:02,158
Okay.

981
00:51:04,183 --> 00:51:05,425
Um...

982
00:51:07,205 --> 00:51:09,430
so I should go now?

983
00:51:09,627 --> 00:51:11,938
Yeah, you should go now.

984
00:51:11,977 --> 00:51:13,846
[laughs]

985
00:51:15,663 --> 00:51:17,227
Thank you.

986
00:51:17,363 --> 00:51:19,366
You're welcome.

987
00:51:25,808 --> 00:51:27,857
Listen, I know you guys have your ways

988
00:51:27,892 --> 00:51:29,722
and everything like that, don't you?

989
00:51:29,757 --> 00:51:33,671
But don't ever hand me a bag
of fucking money in public.

990
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:36,484
I'm sorry, Jimmy. I just, I thought that...

991
00:51:36,556 --> 00:51:38,651
No, I know. I get it. It's all right.

992
00:51:38,686 --> 00:51:40,732
Don't sweat it. But I mean...

993
00:51:42,527 --> 00:51:43,820
All right.

994
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:45,226
Never again.

995
00:51:45,295 --> 00:51:48,668
But we're good with Wheeler, right?

996
00:51:48,703 --> 00:51:51,073
[chuckles]

997
00:52:04,563 --> 00:52:05,985
MAN: Afternoon, Mr. Wheeler!

998
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:07,342
Howdy.

999
00:52:31,329 --> 00:52:32,686
Roger Wheeler?

1000
00:52:32,721 --> 00:52:35,309
- [gunshot]
- [children screaming]

1001
00:52:41,482 --> 00:52:43,091
GENNARO: <i>What the fuck
is this jai alai thing</i>

1002
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:46,144
<i>that Whitey's got his
fingers into all of a sudden?</i>

1003
00:52:46,179 --> 00:52:47,547
<i>What is this bullshit?</i>

1004
00:52:47,602 --> 00:52:49,305
MAN: <i>That's the word on the street.</i>

1005
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,628
<i>Looks like a stupid
fucking game, you ask me.</i>

1006
00:52:51,663 --> 00:52:53,192
<i>Yeah, well, I'll tell ya.</i>

1007
00:52:53,227 --> 00:52:54,741
<i>I don't picture Bulger
going all the way</i>

1008
00:52:54,776 --> 00:52:57,194
<i>out to Tulsa, Oklahoma,
to kill somebody.</i>

1009
00:52:57,254 --> 00:52:59,710
<i>But then again, he's
such a sick little fuck.</i>

1010
00:52:59,745 --> 00:53:02,587
<i>And that stupid half-breed
buddy of his, Flemmi.</i>

1011
00:53:02,635 --> 00:53:04,733
<i>The two of them, they'll
go anywhere, anytime</i>

1012
00:53:04,809 --> 00:53:08,137
<i>and whack anybody out if there's
a few bucks in it for them.</i>

1013
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:10,571
MORRIS: I got to shut this
fucking thing down, John.

1014
00:53:10,606 --> 00:53:13,146
Now we got people on tape

1015
00:53:13,194 --> 00:53:16,357
talking about how Whitey
and Flemmi committed murder.

1016
00:53:16,396 --> 00:53:18,887
That is a big fucking problem.

1017
00:53:18,922 --> 00:53:22,445
That tape is just gangsters talking shit

1018
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,908
like little fucking housewives.

1019
00:53:23,943 --> 00:53:26,003
Yeah, maybe. But I got
to tell you something.

1020
00:53:26,038 --> 00:53:28,144
McGuire is gonna start asking questions.

1021
00:53:28,192 --> 00:53:31,024
That is why I'm gonna file it very deep.

1022
00:53:31,059 --> 00:53:33,548
All right? Problem gone.

1023
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:34,367
Gone.

1024
00:53:34,402 --> 00:53:35,488
That's against protocol.

1025
00:53:35,523 --> 00:53:37,259
Fuck protocol.

1026
00:53:37,575 --> 00:53:38,695
Fuck it.

1027
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:39,623
It's a little lie,

1028
00:53:39,664 --> 00:53:43,878
a little white lie to
protect the bigger truth.

1029
00:53:44,033 --> 00:53:46,441
You know what Jimmy has given us.

1030
00:53:46,516 --> 00:53:48,651
A gold mine.

1031
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:53,153
And do you want to be the
person that jeopardizes that?

1032
00:53:53,315 --> 00:53:57,712
We are bringing down the house, man.

1033
00:53:57,802 --> 00:53:59,948
La Cosa Nostra.

1034
00:54:00,158 --> 00:54:02,427
So just relax.

1035
00:54:03,097 --> 00:54:04,488
Relax.

1036
00:54:05,086 --> 00:54:07,062
I'll handle it. It's on me.

1037
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,995
I got this.

1038
00:54:14,403 --> 00:54:17,716
<i>Authorities in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
are still sifting through clues</i>

1039
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:21,188
<i>in the murder of Roger Wheeler,
head of the Telex Corporation.</i>

1040
00:54:21,243 --> 00:54:23,708
- <i>Today, Telex offered a large reward...</i>
- Turn it up.

1041
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,459
<i>...for information leading
to the arrest of the killer.</i>

1042
00:54:25,494 --> 00:54:28,375
Hey! Turn it the fuck up!

1043
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:30,923
<i>...Wheeler's more controversial
business holdings.</i>

1044
00:54:30,998 --> 00:54:33,101
<i>Sandy Gilmore has a report.</i>

1045
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:37,356
GILMORE: <i>Roger Wheeler was
gunned down at close range</i>

1046
00:54:37,404 --> 00:54:39,339
<i>as he left his weekly golf game.</i>

1047
00:54:39,374 --> 00:54:42,210
<i>Wheeler was a self-made,

1048
00:54:45,017 --> 00:54:46,004
[retching]

1049
00:54:49,822 --> 00:54:51,778
What do you want, huh?

1050
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:54,900
[sniffs]

1051
00:55:03,874 --> 00:55:06,472
This meeting between
Rizzo and Sal Manzinni.

1052
00:55:06,507 --> 00:55:07,970
The walk-in in Interview 3

1053
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:10,841
says Whitey Bulger killed Roger Wheeler.

1054
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:17,376
Gentlemen, this is Brian Halloran.

1055
00:55:17,509 --> 00:55:19,633
You have something you want to tell us?

1056
00:55:19,668 --> 00:55:21,027
[door closes]

1057
00:55:21,573 --> 00:55:24,268
There's a lot I can tell
you. I need guarantees first.

1058
00:55:24,303 --> 00:55:26,613
CONNOLLY: Fuck you. You
don't get no guarantees.

1059
00:55:26,646 --> 00:55:28,449
You talk or you walk.

1060
00:55:31,543 --> 00:55:33,157
[sighs]

1061
00:55:33,339 --> 00:55:34,941
Okay.

1062
00:55:35,747 --> 00:55:39,331
Whitey Bulger planned
to murder Roger Wheeler,

1063
00:55:39,396 --> 00:55:40,778
that jai alai dude from Tulsa.

1064
00:55:40,813 --> 00:55:42,256
It's been on the news and everything.

1065
00:55:42,317 --> 00:55:44,143
- Tulsa?
- Mm-hmm.

1066
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:48,918
Oh. So, what does some
random jai alai guy in Tulsa

1067
00:55:48,981 --> 00:55:50,918
have to do with Whitey Bulger?

1068
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,135
Whitey was pulling down
some serious coin in jai alai

1069
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:54,687
until Wheeler bought the fucking thing,

1070
00:55:54,722 --> 00:55:56,858
and he didn't want to
cut Whitey in for a piece.

1071
00:55:56,893 --> 00:55:57,928
So...

1072
00:55:58,114 --> 00:56:00,701
You two know anything about this?

1073
00:56:00,787 --> 00:56:01,781
Psh.

1074
00:56:02,347 --> 00:56:03,718
Go on.

1075
00:56:05,102 --> 00:56:07,764
Bulger paid me 20 grand to
keep quiet about the hit.

1076
00:56:07,837 --> 00:56:09,682
Listen, you got to protect me.

1077
00:56:09,717 --> 00:56:10,905
'Cause if you don't, I'm fuckin' dead!

1078
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,018
What weapon was used on Wheeler?

1079
00:56:13,085 --> 00:56:15,745
How should I know? I didn't do
the hit. Johnny Martorano did.

1080
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,406
How do you know it was Martorano?

1081
00:56:17,441 --> 00:56:20,626
Look, I make my living
on the streets, okay?

1082
00:56:20,661 --> 00:56:22,521
All right? I know these things.

1083
00:56:22,589 --> 00:56:25,158
Hey, look! Look at me!
You got to protect me.

1084
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:27,605
Well, so far, you haven't given us anything

1085
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,129
to merit protection.

1086
00:56:29,198 --> 00:56:30,640
Are you fuckin' deaf?

1087
00:56:30,675 --> 00:56:32,370
I just gave you two fucking names!

1088
00:56:32,405 --> 00:56:35,664
Where was this so-called
meeting taking place?

1089
00:56:37,336 --> 00:56:38,745
You...

1090
00:56:40,284 --> 00:56:42,462
All right, all right.

1091
00:56:42,635 --> 00:56:44,020
Okay.

1092
00:56:44,284 --> 00:56:46,625
I'm in Miami, I hear Jimmy's in town,

1093
00:56:46,691 --> 00:56:48,818
and I tag along to a little spot

1094
00:56:48,881 --> 00:56:51,138
with Steve Flemmi, Jimmy,

1095
00:56:51,206 --> 00:56:54,728
and this other guy... guy, Callahan.

1096
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:56,557
And I'm just minding
my own fucking business,

1097
00:56:56,592 --> 00:56:59,581
and then Callahan says
that he thinks that Wheeler

1098
00:56:59,657 --> 00:57:00,821
is gonna be a problem.

1099
00:57:00,902 --> 00:57:03,525
And then Jimmy says,

1100
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,266
"Do you think his widow would be willing

1101
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:07,362
- to sell the franchise?"
- His widow?

1102
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:09,754
Mm-hmm. We all know
what that means, right?

1103
00:57:09,835 --> 00:57:12,605
And then Flemmi asked me
if I could take care of it.

1104
00:57:13,524 --> 00:57:15,940
Would you take a lie detector?

1105
00:57:16,055 --> 00:57:17,880
Okay.

1106
00:57:17,948 --> 00:57:20,070
- Yeah?
- No.

1107
00:57:20,157 --> 00:57:22,471
'Cause then you might start
asking me other questions.

1108
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:25,126
Right? And next thing I know, boom!

1109
00:57:25,161 --> 00:57:27,702
You got me on like 15 other
things I didn't even do!

1110
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:30,789
"Boom"? What did you not do, Brian?

1111
00:57:30,824 --> 00:57:34,361
Did you not kill your drug
dealers in a Chinese restaurant?

1112
00:57:34,452 --> 00:57:36,203
'Cause that's why you're really here.

1113
00:57:36,238 --> 00:57:37,852
That's all over the fucking street,

1114
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:39,688
so you thought you'd come in here

1115
00:57:39,769 --> 00:57:42,145
and try and cop some
immunity before the fact.

1116
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:43,601
That's what's really going on, isn't it,

1117
00:57:43,636 --> 00:57:45,521
you coke-snorting piece of shit?

1118
00:57:45,602 --> 00:57:47,239
FITZPATRICK: Connolly?

1119
00:57:50,148 --> 00:57:52,952
I'm a fuckin' dead man!

1120
00:58:01,336 --> 00:58:02,543
What do you think?

1121
00:58:02,578 --> 00:58:07,436
I don't believe a fucking
word that guy says.

1122
00:58:08,042 --> 00:58:10,095
I say we cut him loose.

1123
00:58:10,174 --> 00:58:12,206
He's a drug addict.

1124
00:58:12,793 --> 00:58:14,103
Morris?

1125
00:58:16,886 --> 00:58:18,058
Yeah.

1126
00:58:18,217 --> 00:58:22,255
He won't take a polygraph? Cut him loose.

1127
00:58:26,379 --> 00:58:27,662
Yeah.

1128
00:58:31,084 --> 00:58:33,654

1131
00:58:43,378 --> 00:58:45,803
- brutal outsiders who wanted to enslave
- _

1132
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:47,009
the good people of Ireland.

1133
00:58:47,044 --> 00:58:49,244
And, today... well, today,

1134
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:52,153
we Bostonians face a similar invasion.

1135
00:58:52,192 --> 00:58:55,926
Drugs, violent crimes
ravaging our communities.

1136
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:58,526
You know, today we fight a new fight,

1137
00:58:58,561 --> 00:59:02,355
a fight so our children and their children,

1138
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:04,342
and children for generations to come

1139
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:08,715
can share the Boston we
hold so dear in our hearts.

1140
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:13,119
So today, to all snakes, we say,
"Get the hell out of Boston!"

1141
00:59:13,191 --> 00:59:15,703
"You'll find no shelter here!"

1142
00:59:15,819 --> 00:59:17,843
To Saint Patrick!

Let's hear it for these boys! Come on, now!

Billy boy! Billy boy!

1146
00:59:30,989 --> 00:59:32,861
Give them a hand!

1147
00:59:39,293 --> 00:59:40,683
Jimmy! Where the fuck have you been?

1148
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,306
I been looking for you everywhere.

1149
00:59:42,341 --> 00:59:44,510
Oh, hey. Come here with me.

1150
00:59:44,545 --> 00:59:46,303
Come here.

1151
00:59:46,584 --> 00:59:49,714
Don't you fucking <i>ever</i> talk
to me in public like that again.

1152
00:59:49,775 --> 00:59:52,010
Did you kill Roger Wheeler?

1153
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:55,680
The businessman from Tulsa.
Did you have him killed?

1154
00:59:55,715 --> 00:59:57,869
Why the fuck would I go to Tulsa

1155
00:59:57,904 --> 01:00:02,056
to kill some fucking
prick I don't even know?

1156
01:00:02,126 --> 01:00:03,756
That's bad for fuckin' business.

1157
01:00:03,791 --> 01:00:07,292
I know that you have a
hand in the World Jai Alai.

1158
01:00:07,327 --> 01:00:10,940
Huh? And suddenly, the new owner gets shot.

1159
01:00:12,101 --> 01:00:14,799
I suggest you think these things through

1160
01:00:14,834 --> 01:00:18,326
before you make unfounded
accusations against me.

1161
01:00:18,361 --> 01:00:19,940
All right, all right.

1162
01:00:20,893 --> 01:00:22,308
Just...

1163
01:00:22,708 --> 01:00:25,578
By the way, let me ask you a question.

1164
01:00:27,872 --> 01:00:30,809
How did you know we was
involved in jai alai?

1165

[marching band plays]

1166

Happy Saint Patrick's Day. How are you?

1167
01:00:58,198 --> 01:01:00,721
Everybody always commented
on my work, right.

1168
01:01:00,756 --> 01:01:02,589
- Sure, they did.
- They did! They did!

1169
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:06,363
I was in the low post, I was driving
it in hard, like fuckin' McHale!

1170
01:01:06,398 --> 01:01:07,027
How could you fuckin' take that?

1171
01:01:07,062 --> 01:01:09,889
- I was!
- You got short arms!

1172
01:01:09,924 --> 01:01:11,742
I don't got short arms.

1173
01:01:11,777 --> 01:01:14,194
You know who had short arms?

1174
01:01:14,395 --> 01:01:17,413
Nate "Tiny" Archibald had short arms.

1175
01:01:17,503 --> 01:01:18,698

down in broad fucking daylight.

you just let him walk out the door?

We're not running a hotel, Charles.

1202

The guy wouldn't even
take a polygraph test.

1203

How did word even leak that
Halloran was in here? Huh?

Are you pointing the finger at me?

I don't know, Charles.

- <i>Isn't that right?</i>
- MAN: <i>Mr. Angiulo,</i>

1233
01:03:49,502 --> 01:03:51,832
<i>we're not infiltrating
legitimate businesses.</i>

1234
01:03:51,876 --> 01:03:53,579
<i>I wouldn't be in a
legitimate business</i>

1235
01:03:53,647 --> 01:03:56,043
<i>for all the fucking
money in the world.</i>

1236
01:03:56,097 --> 01:03:59,072
<i>We're selling marijuana.
We're not infiltrating.</i>

1237
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:00,706
<i>We're illegal here, legal there.</i>

1238
01:04:00,741 --> 01:04:02,754
<i>Arsonists. We're
every fuckin' thing.</i>

1239

<i>Pimps? So what? Prostitutes?</i>

1240
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:08,875
<i>Yeah. Yeah, we're a
fucking bookmaker.</i>

1241

WEEKS: And finally,
they hit the mother lode.

1242
01:04:14,679 --> 01:04:17,768
They got Angiulo talking
bookmaking, loan-sharking,

1243
01:04:17,843 --> 01:04:22,697
and use of arson, how he
handled his pimps and his pros.

1244
01:04:23,454 --> 01:04:24,421
You must have heard...

1245
01:04:24,481 --> 01:04:26,019
they called him "The Mafia Hunter,"

1246

MARTORANO: Yes.

1265
01:05:22,103 --> 01:05:26,825
Was John Connolly in Miami in
the spring of 1982, as well?

1266

How was that?

1273
01:05:43,551 --> 01:05:46,426
Jimmy had some loose ends to tie up.

1274
01:05:46,517 --> 01:05:48,165
I think he thought having Connolly along

1275
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,969

1293
01:07:08,806 --> 01:07:11,708
you killed John Callahan
that night in Miami...

1294
01:07:11,828 --> 01:07:15,770
shot him in the head and stuffed
him in the trunk of his own car.

1295
01:07:16,004 --> 01:07:17,497
Yes.

1296
01:07:17,603 --> 01:07:20,213
Was John Connolly aware of that fact?

1297
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:22,412
Yes, he was.

1298
01:07:22,915 --> 01:07:24,461
I see.

Those lapels, that tapering.

1303
01:07:48,659 --> 01:07:51,670
I see you got a nice,
new gold watch there, too.

1304
01:07:53,064 --> 01:07:54,179
What are you getting at, Marianne?

1305
01:07:54,214 --> 01:07:55,729
Nothing. Not anything.

1306
01:07:55,762 --> 01:07:57,583
- Marianne?
- Hmm?

1307
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,123
You're dressing differently.
You're walking differently.

1308
01:08:01,158 --> 01:08:02,575
You're getting manicures.

1309
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:05,425
Uhh... I'm walking differently?

1310
01:08:05,499 --> 01:08:06,647
Yeah, I think you are.

1311
01:08:06,728 --> 01:08:09,632
Your head and your shoulders,
the way you carry yourself.

1312
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:10,776
You're changing, John.

1313
01:08:10,809 --> 01:08:13,407
I'm not changing. I'm not changing!

1314
01:08:13,442 --> 01:08:16,573
I'm... I might be getting
older, but I'm not changing.

1315
01:08:16,608 --> 01:08:18,082
It's Jimmy Bulger that's changing you.

1316

Ah, here we go.

1317
01:08:19,364 --> 01:08:21,633
Ever since you locked arms
with that guy, you've changed.

1318
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:23,607
I can see it like the nose on my face.

1319

He's bad news, John.

1320
01:08:24,901 --> 01:08:26,090
He's not bad news.

1321
01:08:26,151 --> 01:08:27,532
He is an informant.

1322
01:08:27,646 --> 01:08:29,232
It's my job.

1323
01:08:29,267 --> 01:08:31,400
You know this. I told you this.

1324
01:08:31,435 --> 01:08:33,776
I've known him since forever.

1325
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:36,359
And you certainly hold your
boyhood heroes in high regard.

1326
01:08:36,394 --> 01:08:37,995
"Jimmy" this, "Jimmy" that.

1327
01:08:38,071 --> 01:08:40,971
He was very good to me
when I was little, Marianne.

1328
01:08:41,055 --> 01:08:42,113
That's all you need to know.

1329
01:08:42,181 --> 01:08:44,179
How was he good to you, John?

1330
01:08:44,299 --> 01:08:45,505
Did he take you
trick-or-treating?

1331
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:49,377
I know that it's kids' stuff to you, maybe.

1332
01:08:50,261 --> 01:08:52,431
I'm gonna go for a drive.

1333
01:08:52,778 --> 01:08:53,878
[whispering] Fuck.

1334
01:08:55,978 --> 01:08:58,217
Like it or not, Marianne,
you married a street kid.

1335
01:08:58,290 --> 01:08:59,473
And the streets taught me

1336
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:02,660
that you give and you get
loyalty from your friends.

1337
01:09:04,815 --> 01:09:06,952
And loyalty means a lot to me.

1338
01:09:11,469 --> 01:09:13,169
You lock it.

they did appear to die.

1342
01:09:24,256 --> 01:09:26,432
Their going looked like a disaster,

1343
01:09:27,224 --> 01:09:29,569
but they are in peace.

1344
01:09:30,765 --> 01:09:33,689
If they experienced
punishment as men see it,

1345
01:09:33,804 --> 01:09:37,632
their hope was rich with immortality.

1346
01:09:37,745 --> 01:09:40,378
God has put them to the test

1347
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,483
and proved them worthy to be with Him.

1348
01:09:43,617 --> 01:09:47,066
He has tested them like gold in a furnace.

1349
01:09:47,197 --> 01:09:51,359
They who trust in Him
will understand the truth."

1350

In the name of the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

1351
01:09:55,445 --> 01:09:55,975
Amen.

1352
01:09:56,010 --> 01:09:57,593
ALL: Amen.

1353
01:10:02,413 --> 01:10:05,424
That's a pity that Jimmy
couldn't pallbearer with us.

1354
01:10:05,478 --> 01:10:10,720
I know, but he was just
protecting the family name.

1355
01:10:10,755 --> 01:10:12,615
He's a...

1356
01:10:13,799 --> 01:10:15,668
he's a good man.

1357
01:10:19,617 --> 01:10:23,301
I remember sitting at
this very table with you

1358
01:10:23,362 --> 01:10:26,677
some 20 years ago, working
on my first campaign.

1359

[chuckles]

1360
01:10:28,501 --> 01:10:29,969
I was stuffing envelopes

1361
01:10:30,019 --> 01:10:33,073
and licking stamps until my tongue was dry.

1362
01:10:33,126 --> 01:10:34,293
[laughs]

1363
01:10:34,434 --> 01:10:36,507
Oh, Jesus, we were just kids.

1364
01:10:36,582 --> 01:10:37,671
Mm-hmm.

1365
01:10:37,776 --> 01:10:39,714
Now look at us.

I'm very sorry for your loss, Jimmy.

1368
01:10:50,932 --> 01:10:52,803
Your mother was a good woman.

Never heard this house so quiet.

MARTORANO: First his son
died, then his mother passed.

1375
01:11:39,303 --> 01:11:41,757
And Jimmy was devastated.

1376
01:11:41,909 --> 01:11:44,056
He was never the same.

1377
01:11:44,149 --> 01:11:45,849
The only time he ever seemed happy

1378
01:11:45,884 --> 01:11:47,992
was when he was talking about the I.R.A.

And I know who Joe Cahill is.

It's a real pleasure, sir.

- Thank you, Jimmy.
- Come on in, Joe.

We're really deep in it, Jimmy,
and we gonna need your help.

you ever laid your Irish eyes on.

1398
01:12:28,381 --> 01:12:29,705
I have to tell you, that would be

1399
01:12:29,766 --> 01:12:32,270
a rather large arsenal, indeed.

We're not choirboys.

1401
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:38,876
I want you to know I'm
here for you, always.

01:20:51,672 --> 01:20:53,427
That's how you want to play this, huh?

1582
01:20:53,462 --> 01:20:54,743
- You keep your voice down.
- You know... fuck you.

1583
01:20:54,778 --> 01:20:56,156
Fuck you, keep my voice down.

1584
01:20:56,191 --> 01:20:57,376
This is my kitchen.

1585
01:20:57,411 --> 01:20:58,928
It's <i>your</i> kitchen.

1586
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:02,901
Don't even fucking start with that, okay?

1587
01:21:03,355 --> 01:21:04,051
I'll be in our room.

1588
01:21:04,086 --> 01:21:05,934
I'll... I'll be in our
room with the door locked.

1589
01:21:05,969 --> 01:21:07,053
- It's... it's... it's a...
- Shut up.

1590
01:21:07,085 --> 01:21:08,935
Yeah, fuck.

1591
01:21:19,665 --> 01:21:20,785
Stevie, what's the matter with you?

1592
01:21:20,832 --> 01:21:23,669
You're quiet tonight, huh? [chuckles]

1593
01:21:24,008 --> 01:21:26,995
You got a problem with people
keeping their mouths shut?

1594
01:21:27,706 --> 01:21:30,243
I'm breaking your balls. Hmm?

1595
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:34,545
Do yourself a favor... don't.

1596
01:21:35,418 --> 01:21:39,540
[clears throat] So, uh, guys.

1597
01:21:39,676 --> 01:21:44,294
Uh, I... I hate to bring this
up at a... at a social dinner,

1598
01:21:44,329 --> 01:21:47,590
but there's this detective in Florida

1599
01:21:47,625 --> 01:21:49,574
that keeps calling us about Callahan.

1600
01:21:49,645 --> 01:21:51,944
Asking questions, and, uh...

1601
01:21:51,979 --> 01:21:54,066
Well, h-h-he just
won't leave it alone,

1602
01:21:54,099 --> 01:21:55,849
and I have to handle it.

1603
01:21:55,981 --> 01:21:57,683
Then handle it.

1604
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:01,436
Well, handle it.

1605
01:22:01,471 --> 01:22:04,475
Well... Yeah.

1606
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:09,272
And Morris...

1607
01:22:10,321 --> 01:22:13,658
you and I got to have
a little sit-down here.

1608
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:20,807
What the fuck did you
marinate this steak in?

1609
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:22,468
Because it's out of this world.

1610
01:22:22,503 --> 01:22:24,004
You're killing me with it.

1611
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:26,075
Now, now, now.

1612
01:22:26,421 --> 01:22:28,941
It's a family secret. Hmm?

1613
01:22:29,239 --> 01:22:31,700
- Come on.
- [laughs]

1614
01:22:31,801 --> 01:22:33,105
Aw.

1615
01:22:33,236 --> 01:22:35,227
That is one of the best goddamn steaks

1616
01:22:35,262 --> 01:22:37,365
- I ever had in my life.
- Mm-hmm.

1617
01:22:37,442 --> 01:22:38,677
Ever.

1618
01:22:42,481 --> 01:22:45,050
- I got a knife over here.
- [laughs]

1619
01:22:45,134 --> 01:22:46,872
Oh, come on. Come on.

1620
01:22:46,935 --> 01:22:48,590
What's... what's the...
what's the family...

1621
01:22:48,650 --> 01:22:50,411
what's the family's secret recipe?

1622
01:22:50,446 --> 01:22:52,721
It's g... it's ground garlic

1623
01:22:52,773 --> 01:22:55,297
and a little bit of soy.

1624
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:58,316
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it. That's it.

1625
01:23:06,016 --> 01:23:08,820
I thought it was a family secret.

1626
01:23:11,751 --> 01:23:14,094
[chuckles] It's a recipe.

1627
01:23:14,148 --> 01:23:15,699
No.

1628
01:23:16,854 --> 01:23:18,302
No.

1629
01:23:19,157 --> 01:23:21,912
You said to me this is a family secret,

1630
01:23:21,947 --> 01:23:24,918
and you gave it up to me, boom.

1631
01:23:25,022 --> 01:23:28,459
Just fucking like that.

1632
01:23:29,073 --> 01:23:30,040
Don't look to John

1633
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:32,472
'cause he's not gonna fucking help you.

1634
01:23:37,736 --> 01:23:41,240
You spill the secret family recipe today,

1635
01:23:41,275 --> 01:23:43,750
maybe you fucking spill about me tomorrow.

1636
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:46,609
Is that something, maybe,
that's a possibility?

1637
01:23:46,644 --> 01:23:47,618
I was just saying...

1638
01:23:47,653 --> 01:23:49,489
You were "just saying"?

1639
01:23:49,615 --> 01:23:53,452
"Just saying" gets
people sent to Allenwood.

1640
01:23:53,518 --> 01:23:57,024
"Just saying" got me a nine-year stretch

1641
01:23:57,059 --> 01:23:59,012
in Leavenworth and Alcatraz.

1642
01:23:59,047 --> 01:24:00,524
You understand?

1643
01:24:00,559 --> 01:24:04,279
So, "just saying"...

1644
01:24:05,463 --> 01:24:09,301
could get you buried real fucking quick.

1645
01:24:18,143 --> 01:24:20,580
[laughing]

1646
01:24:27,164 --> 01:24:29,353
Look at his fucking face!

1647
01:24:29,388 --> 01:24:32,158
Hey! I'm fucking with you.

1648
01:24:32,191 --> 01:24:33,523
Hey, I'm fucking with you.

1649
01:24:33,558 --> 01:24:35,759
It's a recipe. Couldn't give a shit.

1650
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:38,698
Tastes great. I'm fucking with you.

1651
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:39,404
[laughs]

1652
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:40,952
- [laughs]
- All right.

1653
01:24:40,987 --> 01:24:43,956
You got... well, you... you got me, too.

1654
01:24:44,129 --> 01:24:44,836
[chuckles]

1655
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:47,537
Listen, I... I want to...
I want to make a toast.

1656
01:24:48,887 --> 01:24:50,556
To success.

1657
01:24:52,035 --> 01:24:54,271
Just getting started.

1658
01:25:01,264 --> 01:25:04,630
Mm. Where's the wife?

1659
01:25:04,864 --> 01:25:06,618
She's, uh... she's resting.

1660
01:25:06,653 --> 01:25:08,989
She's... she's a little under the weather.

1661
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:13,523
Didn't... didn't I just see her?

1662
01:25:13,754 --> 01:25:15,000
Yeah, she was helping.

1663
01:25:15,065 --> 01:25:18,552
She, uh... well, sh... sh...
she's not feeling very good.

1664
01:25:18,706 --> 01:25:19,993
Oh, gee.

1665
01:25:20,067 --> 01:25:21,426
Like a...

1666
01:25:21,553 --> 01:25:23,804
You know what? I'll go have a look at her.

1667
01:25:23,911 --> 01:25:25,119
Jimmy. Jimmy.

1668
01:25:25,154 --> 01:25:26,637
She's sick. She's fi... she's fi...

1669
01:25:26,672 --> 01:25:28,237
listen... fine.

1670
01:25:40,316 --> 01:25:42,252
[doorknob rattles]

1671
01:25:44,601 --> 01:25:46,104
[knock on door]

1672
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,011
Oh.

1673
01:25:50,046 --> 01:25:52,450
Hi. I thought you were John.

1674
01:25:53,112 --> 01:25:55,579
No, it ain't John.

1675
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:58,789
Come on. Come down and join us.

1676
01:25:58,835 --> 01:26:01,281
No, I'm not feeling
well. Thank you, though.

1677
01:26:02,016 --> 01:26:03,551
Marianne, you know what you're doing?

1678
01:26:03,586 --> 01:26:06,286
You're embarrassing your
husband in front of his friends,

1679
01:26:06,334 --> 01:26:07,670
that's what you're doing.

1680
01:26:07,751 --> 01:26:10,421
And you know that's what you're doing.

1681
01:26:10,885 --> 01:26:14,037
I don't know what John told
you, but I'm feeling ill.

1682
01:26:15,857 --> 01:26:17,396
That's all.

1683
01:26:17,563 --> 01:26:19,523
Please, no offense.

1684
01:26:22,298 --> 01:26:24,743
Well, let's see what you got.

1685
01:26:25,195 --> 01:26:27,021
Um...

1686
01:26:28,295 --> 01:26:29,972
yeah.

1687
01:26:32,876 --> 01:26:34,905
Well...

1688
01:26:35,664 --> 01:26:38,395
you don't feel warm.

1689
01:26:40,096 --> 01:26:42,162
Got any chills?

1690
01:26:43,086 --> 01:26:44,634
'Cause normally, you get the chills

1691
01:26:44,669 --> 01:26:47,267
before the flu comes on, you know?

1692
01:26:50,988 --> 01:26:53,091
Any soreness there?

1693
01:26:55,265 --> 01:26:59,195
What are you feeling
there? You feel something?

1694
01:27:01,018 --> 01:27:04,747
'Cause I don't feel any
swollen glands there.

1695
01:27:06,397 --> 01:27:12,592
But, you know, me, I
had to learn the hard way

1696
01:27:13,618 --> 01:27:16,547
not to take chances
with this kind of thing.

1697
01:27:16,608 --> 01:27:18,877
You know what I'm saying?

1698
01:27:20,563 --> 01:27:22,609
Poor little thing.

1699
01:27:23,688 --> 01:27:25,697
You get some rest.

1700
01:27:25,857 --> 01:27:28,182
Wouldn't want nothing to happen to you.

1701
01:27:38,269 --> 01:27:40,704
John's a lucky man.

1702
01:27:45,328 --> 01:27:48,547
[breathing shakily]

1703
01:28:12,414 --> 01:28:13,695
Jimmy?

1704
01:28:15,142 --> 01:28:17,436
I'll get it there safe and sound.

1705
01:28:17,783 --> 01:28:19,614
You can sleep on it.

1706
01:28:19,724 --> 01:28:21,684
I know you will, McIntyre.

1707
01:28:21,756 --> 01:28:23,688
Have safe travels, huh?

1708
01:28:24,244 --> 01:28:25,953
All right.

1709
01:28:25,988 --> 01:28:26,663
Stevie.

1710
01:28:26,698 --> 01:28:28,655
Take care of it, John.

1711
01:28:29,201 --> 01:28:31,085
Weeksy, give me a call.

1712
01:28:31,205 --> 01:28:33,523
Thanks for everything,
Jimmy. We won't forget it.

1713
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:35,036
For me, it's an honor.

1714
01:28:35,124 --> 01:28:36,725
The honor's ours.

1715
01:28:37,035 --> 01:28:38,473
Thanks, pal.

1716
01:28:46,110 --> 01:28:48,780

1717
01:28:50,329 --> 01:28:53,351
_

1718
01:28:55,181 --> 01:28:57,089
CONNOLLY: Hope I'm not interrupting.

1719
01:28:57,121 --> 01:28:58,975
Special Agent John Connolly.

1720
01:28:59,010 --> 01:29:00,643
I know who you are. I've
heard a lot about you.

1721
01:29:00,678 --> 01:29:02,699
Oh, good things, I hope.

1722
01:29:02,794 --> 01:29:05,332
Listen, little welcome
wagon present for you.

1723
01:29:05,426 --> 01:29:07,362
- Big game.
- I'm good.

1724
01:29:07,397 --> 01:29:09,735
Are you sure about that?
Clemens is on the mound tonight.

1725
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:11,315
I'm sure about that.

1726
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:12,853
All right.

1727
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:14,534
Work, work, work.

1728
01:29:14,615 --> 01:29:16,551
Well, listen, after... after you finish,

1729
01:29:16,586 --> 01:29:18,573
come down to
The Bell-In-Hand.

1730
01:29:18,643 --> 01:29:20,507
I would like to buy you a pint,

1731
01:29:20,542 --> 01:29:23,049
and you can meet some of the other agents.

1732
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:27,914
Do you have a case for me, Agent Connolly?

1733
01:29:27,949 --> 01:29:30,688
No, I just came to i... introduce myself.

1734
01:29:30,723 --> 01:29:33,169
You know, couple of local
boys moving up the ranks.

1735
01:29:33,224 --> 01:29:36,302
Maybe we can help each other along. Yeah.

1736
01:29:36,364 --> 01:29:39,326
Bring me cases, that's all the help I need.

1737
01:29:40,097 --> 01:29:41,478
All right.

1738
01:29:43,126 --> 01:29:45,978
All right, well, [chuckles]
I'll leave you to it, then.

1739
01:29:46,115 --> 01:29:47,544
Hey, you know, since you're here.

1740
01:29:47,579 --> 01:29:48,851
Yeah?

1741
01:29:49,266 --> 01:29:51,318
How come no one has nailed Whitey Bulger?

1742
01:29:51,353 --> 01:29:53,282
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1743
01:29:53,317 --> 01:29:55,700
That won't work. I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

1744
01:29:55,735 --> 01:29:57,916
- Excuse me?
- Now, what's Bulger done?

1745
01:29:57,985 --> 01:30:02,898
He's a smalltime hood, but he...
he... he's an invaluable asset.

1746
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,495
What's he done?

1747
01:30:05,563 --> 01:30:07,837
Everything, evidently.

1748
01:30:07,872 --> 01:30:10,885
Drugs, extortion, murder.

1749
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:11,743
I'd heard rumors,

1750
01:30:11,798 --> 01:30:14,071
but these other informant
reports make it clear.

1751
01:30:14,106 --> 01:30:14,892
And he... here's the thing...

1752
01:30:14,927 --> 01:30:17,890
every time we start a
formal investigation, poof!

1753
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:20,245
Goes away. He slips free.

1754
01:30:20,505 --> 01:30:22,546
How do you account for that?

1755
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:23,962
I don't know.

1756
01:30:24,597 --> 01:30:27,262
Luck of the Irish? [chuckles]

1757
01:30:27,382 --> 01:30:29,257
"Luck of the Irish"? That's
what you're going with?

1758
01:30:29,292 --> 01:30:31,361
Well, it's...

1759
01:30:33,002 --> 01:30:35,424
...it's slandering lies

1760
01:30:35,459 --> 01:30:37,862
from his brother Billy's
political opponents.

1761
01:30:37,897 --> 01:30:39,908
These fucking assholes from Cambridge,

1762
01:30:39,943 --> 01:30:41,786
they will do anything to bring Billy down

1763
01:30:41,821 --> 01:30:43,423
because they can't stand

1764
01:30:43,458 --> 01:30:45,891
power in the hands of a Mick from Southie.

1765
01:30:45,926 --> 01:30:46,949
You don't think Billy's protecting

1766
01:30:46,984 --> 01:30:48,403
his older brother, just maybe?

1767
01:30:48,438 --> 01:30:50,080
No! No way.

1768
01:30:50,163 --> 01:30:51,670
Really?

1769
01:30:52,001 --> 01:30:52,801
Well, it seems to me

1770
01:30:52,836 --> 01:30:54,349
you'd have to believe
in fucking leprechauns

1771
01:30:54,417 --> 01:30:57,495
to think we have the
biggest crime lord in Boston

1772
01:30:57,641 --> 01:31:00,078
and be brothers with the
most powerful politician

1773
01:31:00,113 --> 01:31:03,779
in the state and them <i>not</i>
be helping each other out.

1774
01:31:03,814 --> 01:31:06,922
I grew up with Billy, Southie.

1775
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,961
So, I know him, I know that <i>he</i> knows

1776
01:31:09,996 --> 01:31:10,916
that it would be crazy

1777
01:31:10,951 --> 01:31:13,787
for him to get mixed up in
anything that Jimmy does.

1778
01:31:13,864 --> 01:31:16,815
It's, you know... too brazen.

1779
01:31:16,928 --> 01:31:18,697
I'll ask you again...

1780
01:31:18,737 --> 01:31:21,499
how come no one has done Whitey Bulger?

1781
01:31:21,595 --> 01:31:24,268
He seems to be involved
in every crime in the city

1782
01:31:24,303 --> 01:31:26,443
and yet the Bureau keeps saying he's clean.

1783
01:31:26,491 --> 01:31:28,824
It's only when <i>another</i>
agency has an informant

1784
01:31:28,859 --> 01:31:31,677
that I hear <i>maybe</i>
Whitey isn't so squeaky clean.

1785
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:33,879
♪♪

1786
01:31:33,911 --> 01:31:35,286
Well, I hear that he's very careful,

1787
01:31:35,321 --> 01:31:39,325
he doesn't use phones...
that kind of stuff, and, uh...

1788
01:31:39,804 --> 01:31:42,880
Who did you say these
other informants were?

1789
01:31:43,296 --> 01:31:44,928
I didn't.

1790
01:31:47,401 --> 01:31:49,581
Listen, from what I hear,

1791
01:31:49,694 --> 01:31:51,578
his criminal days are all but over.

1792
01:31:51,613 --> 01:31:53,989
His... his partner and
him, they gone legit...

1793
01:31:54,024 --> 01:31:56,164
Christ, Connolly, you fucking with me?!

1794
01:31:56,199 --> 01:31:58,232
Is Whitey never using phones and careful,

1795
01:31:58,267 --> 01:32:00,046
or is Whitey retired?!

1796
01:32:00,093 --> 01:32:01,461
I don't...

1797
01:32:02,546 --> 01:32:04,644
I mean, I just... I'm not in my office...

1798
01:32:04,679 --> 01:32:05,948
these are things that I hear,

1799
01:32:05,983 --> 01:32:07,420
I don't know if all of them are true.

1800
01:32:07,455 --> 01:32:09,962
Do your job and find out!

1801
01:32:13,077 --> 01:32:15,646
I am. I am. I... I wa...

1802
01:32:16,603 --> 01:32:20,113
You know that I wouldn't come
here if it wasn't serious,

1803
01:32:20,264 --> 01:32:21,712
if there was anywhere else I could turn,

1804
01:32:21,747 --> 01:32:23,717
and I know that the last thing you need

1805
01:32:23,752 --> 01:32:26,916
is to have Jimmy's business
crossing paths with yours.

1806
01:32:26,951 --> 01:32:28,879
Well, your grasp of the
situation is so keen,

1807
01:32:28,914 --> 01:32:30,580
it makes me wonder what you're doing here.

1808
01:32:30,615 --> 01:32:35,229
This new guy, Wyshak, has
a serious hard-on for Jimmy.

1809
01:32:35,264 --> 01:32:37,076
And that can't be good for any of us.

1810
01:32:37,139 --> 01:32:38,543
And you're telling me this why?

1811
01:32:38,609 --> 01:32:40,664
Maybe you can influence him.

1812
01:32:40,699 --> 01:32:41,867
Just make him listen to reason!

1813
01:32:41,902 --> 01:32:43,688
I'm not kissing your ass, Billy,

1814
01:32:43,729 --> 01:32:46,201
but you are the most
powerful man in the city.

1815
01:32:46,236 --> 01:32:47,973
Not that I would, but Wyshak's federal,

1816
01:32:48,021 --> 01:32:49,621
and I'm state, and you know that.

1817
01:32:49,656 --> 01:32:54,126
But where we come from, I know and you know

1818
01:32:54,161 --> 01:32:57,759
that what is written on a piece of paper

1819
01:32:57,891 --> 01:33:03,974
is less important than
blood and honor and loyalty.

1820
01:33:07,676 --> 01:33:10,032
I'm not asking you to help me.

1821
01:33:10,787 --> 01:33:13,290
I'm asking you to help your brother.

1822
01:33:15,725 --> 01:33:18,300
That's the same thing now, isn't it?

1823
01:33:24,799 --> 01:33:27,003
[sighs]

1824
01:33:29,759 --> 01:33:37,190
Billy, Wyshak is asking
questions about you, too.

1825
01:33:39,922 --> 01:33:41,484
Oh.

1826
01:33:48,126 --> 01:33:51,284
John, you know I have the
utmost respect for you.

1827
01:33:51,319 --> 01:33:55,283
Really, I do, which is why I
can tell you with all my heart

1828
01:33:55,454 --> 01:33:57,533
that if you ever come into my office again

1829
01:33:57,588 --> 01:33:59,501
with a fucked-up idea like that

1830
01:33:59,536 --> 01:34:03,243
you'll rue the day you ever
thought of joining the FBI.

1831
01:34:08,626 --> 01:34:10,496
Jeannie will show you out.

1832
01:34:19,431 --> 01:34:20,679
FITZPATRICK: This report has information

1833
01:34:20,714 --> 01:34:24,826
attributed to our prized
informant Whitey Bulger.

1834
01:34:27,968 --> 01:34:30,253
And this is the same piece of information

1835
01:34:30,288 --> 01:34:32,424
from one of our other informants

1836
01:34:32,516 --> 01:34:34,118
dated four weeks earlier.

1837
01:34:34,152 --> 01:34:38,038
_

1838
01:34:38,073 --> 01:34:39,620
This is information credited to

1839
01:34:39,655 --> 01:34:43,749
our supposedly prized
informant James "Whitey" Bulger.

1840
01:34:46,905 --> 01:34:49,421
- And the same piece of information
- _

1841
01:34:49,456 --> 01:34:53,750
dated six weeks earlier,
different informant.

1842
01:34:54,102 --> 01:34:55,511
_

1843
01:34:55,546 --> 01:34:57,532
In fact, if you take a
look at Bulger's pile,

1844
01:34:57,597 --> 01:34:59,206
you'll find the same situation played out

1845
01:34:59,267 --> 01:35:01,224
time and again from other sources.

1846
01:35:01,299 --> 01:35:07,815
In fact, you'll find very little
from Bulger that means shit.

1847
01:35:07,850 --> 01:35:09,886
[typewriter clicking]

1848
01:35:13,704 --> 01:35:16,666
<i>Customs officials in Boston
say they have seized a trawler</i>

1849
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:19,656
<i>used to smuggle weapons
to Irish terrorists.</i>

1850
01:35:19,691 --> 01:35:22,462
<i>Agents say the trawler ferried
a load of arms and ammunition</i>

1851
01:35:22,497 --> 01:35:24,696
- <i>to the Irish coast last week.</i>
- Jesus fucking Christ.

1852
01:35:24,731 --> 01:35:27,277
<i>The weapons were intercepted
by the Irish Navy</i>

1853
01:35:27,312 --> 01:35:29,868
<i>after they had been
transferred to a smaller ship.</i>

1854
01:35:29,919 --> 01:35:32,732
- <i>Officials say they have seized the ship's log and other doc...</i>
- Motherfucker.

1855
01:35:33,104 --> 01:35:34,872
Northern Ireland?

1856
01:35:34,952 --> 01:35:36,187
FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

1857
01:35:38,534 --> 01:35:40,309
Well, how did they know about the ship?

1858
01:35:40,344 --> 01:35:43,102
The pilot. Turns out he's
also a snitch for D.E.A.

1859
01:35:43,169 --> 01:35:44,762
Customs, too.

1860
01:35:46,136 --> 01:35:47,858
What's his name?

1861
01:35:48,068 --> 01:35:49,719
- I don't know.
- How do you not know?

1862
01:35:49,754 --> 01:35:52,816
I... don't know, John.

1863
01:35:55,844 --> 01:35:59,381
All right, well, where is
this guy now, the pilot?

1864
01:35:59,477 --> 01:36:02,080
- I want to talk to him.
- Oh, no can do.

1865
01:36:02,143 --> 01:36:04,549
What do you mean, "No can do"? Yes, can do.

1866
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,364
Sorry, he belongs to D.E.A.

1867
01:36:06,399 --> 01:36:08,386
Well... okay.

1868
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:11,742
You ask permission for us to talk to him.

1869
01:36:11,790 --> 01:36:13,864
- I did.
- And?

1870
01:36:13,929 --> 01:36:16,499
It's not gonna happen, John.

1871
01:36:44,563 --> 01:36:46,190
MCINTYRE: I don't like that guy, though.

1872
01:36:46,225 --> 01:36:48,382
He's got a big fucking mouth.

1873
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:51,507
FLEMMI: Yeah, take a right here.

1874
01:36:51,582 --> 01:36:53,018
Yeah? All right.

1875
01:36:53,242 --> 01:36:54,731
All right, I got it.

1876
01:36:57,173 --> 01:36:59,776
[laughs] Weeksy, what's up?

1877
01:37:02,114 --> 01:37:05,001
Where is everybody? I thought
it was a fucking party.

1878
01:37:06,125 --> 01:37:08,179
Bulger's playing us, Nick.

1879
01:37:08,265 --> 01:37:09,752
Making a fool of the Bureau,

1880
01:37:09,787 --> 01:37:11,330
hiding behind his informant status

1881
01:37:11,385 --> 01:37:13,664
to run roughshod over my city.

1882
01:37:13,699 --> 01:37:15,553
Using us to cover for him.

1883
01:37:15,588 --> 01:37:16,792
I won't stand for it.

1884
01:37:16,827 --> 01:37:18,193
NICK: And I am distressed about that,

1885
01:37:18,248 --> 01:37:19,239
but from where I sit,

1886
01:37:19,274 --> 01:37:21,816
we have bigger priorities to consider.

1887
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:23,181
So, you're telling me to do nothing.

1888
01:37:23,229 --> 01:37:25,430
No, not at all.

1889
01:37:25,577 --> 01:37:27,340
I'm telling you we can't taint

1890
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:29,722
one of the most successful
RICO prosecutions

1891
01:37:29,757 --> 01:37:30,745
in the history of the Bureau

1892
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:35,437
just to get Whitey
Bulger, psychopath or not.

1893
01:37:36,297 --> 01:37:37,183
But we have no objection

1894
01:37:37,218 --> 01:37:39,740
to your going after
the agents handling him.

1895
01:37:42,046 --> 01:37:44,613
[sighs] Can't you see what's happening?

1896
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:46,948
The vise is closing on us.

1897
01:37:47,882 --> 01:37:49,628
Listen to me.

1898
01:37:49,869 --> 01:37:52,423
Did you know it was Hampton and Dawson

1899
01:37:52,458 --> 01:37:55,192
that hit that national bank on Exeter?

1900
01:37:55,239 --> 01:37:59,523
No, and neither did I,
until Whitey Bulger told us.

1901
01:37:59,575 --> 01:38:00,856
Whitey didn't tell us that.

1902
01:38:00,891 --> 01:38:02,879
Yes, he did.

1903
01:38:03,034 --> 01:38:07,448
Nick McVeigh is running speed
to high schools in Newton.

1904
01:38:07,496 --> 01:38:10,488
High school kids, for fuck's sake.

1905
01:38:10,742 --> 01:38:12,207
Thank God for Whitey Bulger.

1906
01:38:12,242 --> 01:38:14,472
- [chuckles] Thank God for Whitey Bulger.
- You hear me?

1907
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:18,232
Whitey introduced dope
to every kid in Southie.

1908
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:21,725
12- and 13-year-old
girls, John.

1909
01:38:22,168 --> 01:38:23,607
What about Halloran?

1910
01:38:23,642 --> 01:38:25,050
And Callahan, huh?

1911
01:38:25,095 --> 01:38:27,157
Douchebags who got what was coming to them.

1912
01:38:27,192 --> 01:38:29,104
It's not our fault.

1913
01:38:29,139 --> 01:38:30,561
It's not our fault?

1914
01:38:30,626 --> 01:38:32,761
- Whose fault is it?
- Not ours.

1915
01:38:32,816 --> 01:38:35,306
That's gonna sound great in court.

1916
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:38,092
McGuire is gonna go to Washington.

1917
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:39,877
You know that, right?

1918
01:38:40,791 --> 01:38:42,896
And he's gonna bring
all the informant files.

1919
01:38:42,991 --> 01:38:47,549
And Wyshak is dead set on
hanging our asses on his wall.

1920
01:38:47,628 --> 01:38:49,591
We are fucked, John.

1921
01:38:49,649 --> 01:38:51,619
- We are fucked.
- Listen to me.

1922
01:38:51,686 --> 01:38:53,652
The Bureau wants results.

1923
01:38:53,730 --> 01:38:55,053
We gave them results.

1924
01:38:55,088 --> 01:38:58,071
We drove a stake through
the black heart of the Mafia.

1925
01:38:58,106 --> 01:39:00,745
Everything else is gonna be a sideshow.

1926
01:39:00,799 --> 01:39:01,990
Now we're stuck with Whitey,

1927
01:39:02,025 --> 01:39:04,606
and without the Italians,
nobody can rein him in,

1928
01:39:04,641 --> 01:39:06,444
and we can't even pull on his chain

1929
01:39:06,479 --> 01:39:08,081
because we're in too deep!

1930
01:39:08,165 --> 01:39:09,532
And he knows it!

1931
01:39:09,567 --> 01:39:12,685
You understand what I'm
saying about a vise?!

1932
01:39:17,548 --> 01:39:19,776
I thought I was doing good.

1933
01:39:20,457 --> 01:39:22,477
I actually thought I
could make a difference.

1934
01:39:22,512 --> 01:39:23,776
We made a difference.

1935
01:39:23,811 --> 01:39:25,873
We put the Mafia out of business.

1936
01:39:25,965 --> 01:39:29,054
If that ain't good, I don't know what is.

1937
01:39:29,770 --> 01:39:30,807
Yeah.

1938
01:39:32,737 --> 01:39:34,667
And you know what we're doing now, John?

1939
01:39:34,805 --> 01:39:37,142
Digging our own fucking graves.

1940
01:39:47,938 --> 01:39:50,440
[keys jingling]

1941
01:39:54,652 --> 01:39:56,648
[lock rattling]

1942
01:39:56,806 --> 01:39:58,542
[sighs]

1943
01:40:00,216 --> 01:40:01,891
God damn it.

1944
01:40:08,266 --> 01:40:10,053
Marianne!

1945
01:40:12,947 --> 01:40:16,160
Marianne, don't do this!

1946
01:40:19,095 --> 01:40:22,384
Marianne, are you fucking kidding me?!

1947
01:40:32,788 --> 01:40:34,278
WYSHAK: This informant
has been a minor player

1948
01:40:34,313 --> 01:40:37,409
in the Boston crime syndicate
since he was a teenager.

1949
01:40:37,489 --> 01:40:39,401
- So you checked his house?
- Yes.

1950
01:40:39,449 --> 01:40:41,051
- And work?
- Mm-hmm.

1951
01:40:41,125 --> 01:40:43,050
And he's never missed an
informant meeting before?

1952
01:40:43,117 --> 01:40:44,928
None I'm aware of. Yeah?

1953
01:40:44,963 --> 01:40:46,186
MAN: No, nothing.

1954
01:40:46,221 --> 01:40:47,411
[knock on door]

1955
01:40:47,468 --> 01:40:49,366
- You want to see me?
- WYSHAK: Yeah, I want to see you!

1956
01:40:49,447 --> 01:40:50,602
McIntyre has vanished

1957
01:40:50,648 --> 01:40:52,498
off the face of the fucking Earth.

1958
01:40:52,549 --> 01:40:53,682
Which seems to be a common phenomenon

1959
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:55,452
for any informant that
says something incriminating

1960
01:40:55,487 --> 01:40:57,124
against Whitey Bulger.

1961
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:01,746
You got nothing to say, Connolly?

1962
01:41:02,143 --> 01:41:03,713
You see these gentlemen here?

1963
01:41:03,997 --> 01:41:05,986
They're gonna help me get this cocksucker.

1964
01:41:06,061 --> 01:41:09,157
If we have to arrest every
lowlife in Boston to do that,

1965
01:41:09,192 --> 01:41:11,093
we'll arrest them... every loan shark,

1966
01:41:11,128 --> 01:41:13,039
every bookie, every drug dealer.

1967
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,746
One of those guys is gonna
make a case against him.

1968
01:41:16,746 --> 01:41:19,041
JIMMY: Of all fucking people...

1969
01:41:20,025 --> 01:41:21,197
[chuckles]

1970
01:41:21,472 --> 01:41:22,771
...you.

1971
01:41:32,289 --> 01:41:33,716
MCINTYRE: [voice
breaking] I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1972
01:41:33,751 --> 01:41:36,972
You've always been fucking
weak, John, since we was kids.

1973
01:41:37,007 --> 01:41:38,291
- [whimpering]
- What'd you tell them?

1974
01:41:38,326 --> 01:41:42,260
[crying] I don't want to
fucking die. Oh, God, Jimmy!

1975
01:41:42,351 --> 01:41:45,125
I need to know exactly
who you fucking talked to,

1976
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:47,463
and exactly what you said.

1977
01:41:47,558 --> 01:41:50,728
A D.E.A. agent by the name of Brown.

1978
01:41:50,763 --> 01:41:52,124
I told him everything...

1979
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:55,185
the I.R.A., Cahill, the whole bit!

1980
01:41:55,284 --> 01:41:58,899
I know I shouldn't have,
Jimmy, but I had no choice!

1981
01:42:01,744 --> 01:42:03,442
Fuck you.

1982
01:42:04,435 --> 01:42:06,713
You always have a choice.

1983
01:42:06,844 --> 01:42:09,509
You just happened to make
the wrong fucking one.

1984
01:42:09,538 --> 01:42:11,950
[breathing shakily]

1985
01:42:12,734 --> 01:42:14,369
Look at me.

1986
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:19,080
I said fucking look at me.

1987
01:42:20,517 --> 01:42:22,721
I known you a long time.

1988
01:42:23,667 --> 01:42:26,670
And for you to fuck me like this...

1989
01:42:29,044 --> 01:42:31,280
...fucking hurts.

1990
01:42:34,452 --> 01:42:37,942
So I'm gonna fucking bury you right here

1991
01:42:37,982 --> 01:42:40,544
where all the other weak
people have been buried.

1992
01:42:40,579 --> 01:42:41,870
Jimmy, I'm sorry!

1993
01:42:41,905 --> 01:42:44,439
But you'll be dead before
Stevie pulls your teeth,

1994
01:42:44,494 --> 01:42:46,377
which is more than you fucking deserve,

1995
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:47,798
- I'll tell you that.
- Jimmy, I'm sorry! Jimmy, I'm sorry!

1996
01:42:47,833 --> 01:42:50,069
Jimmy, I'm sorry! Oh, God, Jimmy, I'm...

1997
01:42:51,185 --> 01:42:52,921
[gurgling]

1998
01:42:59,809 --> 01:43:02,246
[grunting]

1999
01:43:12,469 --> 01:43:16,116
[panting slightly]

2000
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:17,481
Take out his fucking teeth.

2001
01:43:17,542 --> 01:43:19,934
Bury him next to the whore.

2002
01:43:45,688 --> 01:43:48,012
Special Agent John Morris, FBI.

2003
01:43:48,217 --> 01:43:50,572
Gerard O'Neill, <i>Boston Globe.</i>

2004
01:43:50,647 --> 01:43:52,451
Dick Lehr, same.

2005
01:43:52,486 --> 01:43:54,945
Thank you for meeting with us.

2006
01:43:55,618 --> 01:43:57,690
I feel like, uh...

2007
01:43:58,861 --> 01:44:00,517
[chuckles softly]

2008
01:44:00,759 --> 01:44:02,866
Like I should be in a confessional.

2009
01:44:03,353 --> 01:44:06,271
It's the right thing to do, John.

2010
01:44:09,016 --> 01:44:11,546
Anything I tell you has
to be off the record.

2011
01:44:11,581 --> 01:44:13,402
- You understand?
- Of course.

2012
01:44:13,437 --> 01:44:17,289
We'll develop our own sources,
corroborate everything.

2013
01:44:18,504 --> 01:44:20,505
[sighs softly]

2014
01:44:20,977 --> 01:44:22,670
Where do I start?

2015
01:44:28,671 --> 01:44:30,428
- What do you know?
- All of it.

2016
01:44:30,463 --> 01:44:31,723
LEHR: We know.

2017
01:44:31,755 --> 01:44:32,930
And you're running it?

2018
01:44:32,965 --> 01:44:34,835
We wouldn't be here if we weren't.

2019
01:44:57,101 --> 01:45:00,230
_

2020
01:45:17,421 --> 01:45:18,712
[sighs]

2021
01:45:20,711 --> 01:45:21,779
What?

2022
01:45:24,654 --> 01:45:26,132
What is it, Jim?

2023
01:45:41,975 --> 01:45:44,070
What the fuck, Jim?

2024
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:47,098
[sighs]

2025
01:45:47,323 --> 01:45:49,400
What the fuck? This is bullshit.

2026
01:45:52,267 --> 01:45:53,757
Right? This isn't true.

2027
01:45:53,905 --> 01:45:57,144
[scoffs] Right?

2028
01:45:58,093 --> 01:46:01,918
Kevin, you're gonna hear

2029
01:46:02,208 --> 01:46:03,565
and you're gonna fucking read

2030
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:06,310
a lot of bullshit about me...

2031
01:46:06,378 --> 01:46:08,714
a lot of nasty things.

2032
01:46:08,951 --> 01:46:12,917
And most of it, if not all
of it, is fucking untrue.

2033
01:46:12,952 --> 01:46:15,124
It's pure fiction.

2034
01:46:15,659 --> 01:46:17,529
You know me.

2035
01:46:18,550 --> 01:46:20,197
And you know these people.

2036
01:46:20,252 --> 01:46:23,007
You know these fucking people.

2037
01:46:23,048 --> 01:46:24,983
They're liars.

2038
01:46:27,137 --> 01:46:29,902
They know no fucking code of honor.

2039
01:46:33,112 --> 01:46:36,385
How many envelopes of fucking cash

2040
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:39,570
did you deliver to these Feds?

2041
01:46:39,605 --> 01:46:43,465
How many cases of wine
for that prick Morris?

2042
01:46:43,507 --> 01:46:45,308
Or fucking vacations,

2043
01:46:45,348 --> 01:46:49,926
or, uh, fucking money,
money, money, fuck it.

2044
01:46:56,585 --> 01:46:59,685
Does that sound like
what an informant does?

2045
01:47:01,534 --> 01:47:03,593
Guy ran a sports and numbers racket

2046
01:47:03,648 --> 01:47:06,843
out of Heller's Cafe,
parlayed it into loan sharking,

2047
01:47:06,878 --> 01:47:09,303
and that into money laundering.

2048
01:47:09,405 --> 01:47:11,618
Says he can give us some big fish.

2049
01:47:11,731 --> 01:47:12,862
Evidence?

2050
01:47:12,910 --> 01:47:14,657
Pictures and sound.

2051
01:47:15,267 --> 01:47:16,903
FBI know anything about this?

2052
01:47:16,938 --> 01:47:18,622
No, but I can call them if you want.

2053
01:47:18,657 --> 01:47:20,467
Absolutely not.

2054
01:47:20,626 --> 01:47:23,195
Can you get me into witness protection?

2055
01:47:23,230 --> 01:47:24,964
Depends what you have.

2056
01:47:24,999 --> 01:47:26,724
I have Whitey Bulger.

2057
01:47:26,779 --> 01:47:29,661
So, Whitey Bulger took a
piece of everything you made?

2058
01:47:29,732 --> 01:47:31,571
What, are you fucking kidding me?

2059
01:47:31,658 --> 01:47:33,869
Everything. Wasn't small either.

2060
01:47:33,904 --> 01:47:36,369
Yeah, Whitey introduced drugs to Southie.

2061
01:47:36,424 --> 01:47:38,097
White stuff, brown stuff.

2062
01:47:38,132 --> 01:47:42,013
Cocaine, heroin, marijuana.

2063
01:47:42,456 --> 01:47:44,036
MAN: Like I said, I
was a half a block away,

2064
01:47:44,071 --> 01:47:46,597
but it was no mistaking what was going on.

2065
01:47:46,635 --> 01:47:48,271
I don't know who it was.

2066
01:47:48,306 --> 01:47:50,172
Pulled him out of a car and
shot him on the fucking...

2067
01:47:50,207 --> 01:47:51,911
right on the ground.

2068
01:47:55,872 --> 01:47:57,945
It's everything...

2069
01:47:58,021 --> 01:48:03,368
extortion, racketeering, murder.

2070
01:48:04,082 --> 01:48:06,214
They got you on all of it.

2071
01:48:06,890 --> 01:48:09,201
And I guess they got me, too.

2072
01:48:11,661 --> 01:48:13,664
You used me, Jimmy.

2073
01:48:14,271 --> 01:48:17,761
It was an alliance, John, nothing more.

2074
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:20,199
[sighs]

2075
01:48:20,915 --> 01:48:22,563
I'll call you in a week.

2076
01:48:22,689 --> 01:48:24,689
Just let me know what you know.

2077
01:48:24,757 --> 01:48:27,271
There's nothing more I'm gonna know.

2078
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:29,669
Ever.

2079
01:48:36,331 --> 01:48:37,831
Okay.

2080
01:48:46,981 --> 01:48:49,632
_

2081
01:49:08,074 --> 01:49:09,051
Gentlemen.

2082
01:49:09,106 --> 01:49:10,841
John Connolly?

2083
01:49:10,977 --> 01:49:13,327
Yeah, I'm John Connolly.

2084
01:49:13,362 --> 01:49:15,291
We have a warrant for your arrest.

2085
01:49:19,108 --> 01:49:21,446
Mr. Connolly, step out
of the building, please.

2086
01:49:23,670 --> 01:49:25,030
Mm.

2087
01:49:26,968 --> 01:49:28,332
[clears throat]

2088
01:49:28,367 --> 01:49:32,036
Do me a favor, boys, and let
me leave with some... dignity.

2089
01:49:32,108 --> 01:49:34,672
Mr. Connolly, step out
of the building, please.

2090
01:49:35,271 --> 01:49:37,274
Mr. Connolly, this way.

2091
01:49:40,022 --> 01:49:41,363
All right.

2092
01:49:43,667 --> 01:49:46,704
You know, this is, uh... uh...

2093
01:50:13,515 --> 01:50:16,432
Show me your hands,
Stevie! Show me your hands!

2094
01:50:16,606 --> 01:50:18,620
Up in the air! Turn around slow!

2095
01:50:18,655 --> 01:50:21,102
The other way. The other way!

2096
01:50:21,407 --> 01:50:23,483
Put your hands on your head.

2097
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:26,125
Put your hands on your head!

2098
01:50:27,611 --> 01:50:30,779
OLSEN: Mr. Flemmi, now that you look back

2099
01:50:30,839 --> 01:50:36,220
at your time with James Bulger,
what is your opinion of him?

2100
