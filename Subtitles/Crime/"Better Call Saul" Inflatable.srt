349
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,168
 I could fight you on this,     
 but you're not worth my time.  

350
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,171
 I'd rather just have you gone. 

351
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:45,943
   I'm sorry you feel that way. 
   I'll just...                 

352
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:48,246
                  ...pack up.   

353
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:48,779
 First,                         

354
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:51,983
 do me the favor of             
 not treating me                
 like a fool for once.          

355
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:54,685
   Tell me, how exactly         
   did I mistreat you?          

356
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,454
 What did I do to deserve       
 this kind of behavior?         

357
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,155
   We gave you opportunities.   
   Encouraged you to excel.     

358
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:01,559
   We got you a car,            
   an apartment.                
   Hell, that cocobolo desk!    

359
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:06,430
 Do you see a desk              
 like that in here?             
 You never gave this a chance.  

360
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,965
           Why?                 

361
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:11,135
       I tried to make it work. 

362
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,871
     Really, I did. I'm just... 

363
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,172
              A square peg.     

364
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:18,776
  If you knew that,             
  why did you take the job?     

365
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,148
                I'm sorry.      

366
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,686
         How much was the desk? 

367
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:30,454
 $7,000.                        

368
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:34,492
        I'll write you a check. 

369

 Fine. For whatever good        
 that does.                     

370
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:39,597
 Take your desk and get out.

    I think you're a good guy.  

372
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:49,173
   For what it's worth,         
   I think you're an asshole.

 you for a minute?

               didn't they?     

412
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,483

 to take them with me.          

413
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,118
            Then there'll be    
            another Mesa Verde.

         you can do it again.

                     No.        

416
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,865
        You're talking to a guy 
        who lived in the back

         At least at the start. 

419
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:35,940
          But in the end,       
          we'll have a practice 
          that is 100% ours.    

420
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:37,274
              That's worth it.  

421

 with nothing.                  

422
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:41,645
                 You're right.  
                 It's a gamble. 

423
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:42,279
     It's a big one.            

424
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:43,914
           Yeah, but you're     
           betting on yourself, 

425
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:47,318
   and from where I sit,        
   the odds are in your favor.  

426
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,886
     You are an amazing lawyer. 

427
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:52,690
        This is your chance     
        to show the world that. 

428
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,160
 So, why not go to Schweikart?  

429
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:59,530
       They'll make me partner, 
       and they're a solid,     
       respectable firm.        

430
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:00,498
           You can't deny that. 

431
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,533
      You deserve more          
      than just a lateral move. 

432
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:05,603
       Bottom line, that's what 
       Schweikart represents.   

433
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:08,105
        He's just Howard Hamlin 
        by a different name.

00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,507
    You keep talking            
    about me and Schweikart.

437
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:16,347
              Hmm, technically, 
              I got fired.      

438
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,315
       What happened?           

439
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:20,484
        It was mutual,          
        and a long time coming. 

440
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:25,222
          That job was never    
          the right fit for me. 
          This is.              

441
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:33,831
   If we're going to            
   be law partners,             
   I need to know one thing.    

442
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:36,634
      What kind of lawyer       
      are you going to be?      

443
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:41,272
 I don't mean what kind of law  
 you're going to practice,      
 I mean... (SIGHS)              

444
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,308
           Are you going to     
           play it straight,    

445
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:48,212
          or are you going      
          to be colorful?       

446
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:51,916
    I'm gonna play it straight. 
    Right down the line.        

447
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:56,787
   I'm gonna dot every "i"      
   and I'm gonna cross every... 

448
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,832
          There's no point      
          in me doing this      
          if I can't be myself. 

449
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:11,802
            Every time          
            I try to do things  
            someone else's way, 

450
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:15,739
        it blows up in my face. 
        That's what happened    
        at Davis and Main,      

451
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,241
      look how that turned out. 

452
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,543
              I almost derailed 
              your career.      

453
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:21,779
           Pissed everyone off. 

454
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:25,783
        I've been trying to be  
        the person someone else 
        wants me to be          

455
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:27,251
     for I don't know how long. 

456
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,820
            First it was Chuck. 
            Then it was you.    

457
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:32,856
     And that's not your fault. 
     That was my choice.        

458
00:26:32,858 --> 00:26:37,895
    But if we're gonna do this, 
    I gotta go into it as me.   

459
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:40,864
                  So, yeah.     

460
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,967
            Colorful. I guess.  

461
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,703
               What do you say? 

462
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,106
           I just...            

463
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:52,476
 I don't see why                
 it's so important to you       
 that we work together.         

464
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:56,146
 I mean, we're already...       
 Why do you need me for this?   

465

 He's a handful, huh?

  Well, he can be               
  a tough nut to crack,         
  but he did rule in my favor.

00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,657
 One day, I just looked around  
 at my life, at who I was.      

606
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:30,627
 And I realized if              
 I kept going                   
 the way I was going...         

607
