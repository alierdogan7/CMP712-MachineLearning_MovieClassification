McKinney wore his watch
on his left wrist.
Where was this found exactly?

865
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:00,729
Right here,
off his left elbow.

866
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,424
Just occurred to me that
priests wear the rosary
while taking confession.

867

She's right.
Dolly, get on the phone

868

he wore his rosary on.
