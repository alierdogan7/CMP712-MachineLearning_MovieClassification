Are you paying attention out there?

Good. Because it's about
to get complicated,

so I'm gonna start out slow
and make it nice and simple for you.

See, once upon a time,

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,112
you could walk into your bank,
and they'd open a vault

12

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,310
We did it to make it go faster.

He gave me this.

- What is it?
- It's erectile cream.

Doesn't even have to be your real name.
Just give me anything I can call you.

- So you can... No, it's okay. It's okay.

690
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,392
You want people
to be able to hear you, right?

691
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,598

is from these catwalks above the stage.

here in his hand,

without disarming the bomb first... Kaboom.

then the dead man's switch
is just another fucking switch.

00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,434
Except, in order to destroy it,
we got to what, shoot Gates?

806
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,194
That's where this guy slipped up.

807
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,589
If he wanted to ensure a kill shot,

808
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,673
he should've put the receiver here,
right over the poor bastard's heart.

809

next to his left kidney.

quick enough to avoid too much blood loss,

he could survive it.

Diane?

826
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,830
Okay, get ready to put her on screen two.
We're gonna put her on screen two.

827
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,030
LEE: We're ready when you are.

828
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,440
PATTY: And go, Jim.

829
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,354
- Here she comes.
- All right.

830
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,875
First, let me start off by saying

831
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,520
on behalf of everyone here at Ibis,

832
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,634
we are prepared to do whatever we can to
get you to put down that gun, Mr. Budwell.

833
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,393
Now, I understand that
you've offered to compensate him

834
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,233
for his losses personally, Lee.

835
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,076
Well, we are absolutely willing to do the
same if it helps put an end to all this.

836
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,717
All right, you walk away now,
double your money.

837
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,314
She knows my last name.

838
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,475
Everybody in the five boroughs
knows your last name by now, Kyle.

839
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,430
Uh...

840
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,398
No, it's too late for your money, lady.

841
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,314
All I want from you is an answer.
I just wanna know what really happened?

842
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,631
Oh, goddamn it!

843
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,639
DIANE: Well, the truth is

844
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,039
- we don't know.
- (CELLPHONE VIBRATING)

845
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,840
We don't know why the algo
suddenly went haywire.

846
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,032
And we don't know why the fail-safes
built to prevent...

847
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,715
PATTY: God, I really hope she has
more to say than "We don't know."

848
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,679
We just don't know.

849
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,594
PATTY: Are you kidding?
This is all she's got? Are you kidding me?

851
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,035
Fine.

852
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,033
Are you watching this?
This is getting out of control.

853
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,635
The amount of scrutiny we're gonna get
after this idiot blows himself up

854
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,552
is going to be unbelievable.

855
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,474
You thought it was bad before?
It's about to get 100 times more intense.

856
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,076
Look, don't worry, okay? We can handle it.
Gates is an idiot.

857
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,039
Just stay the course, okay?
I'm working Mambo night and day.

858
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,598
I would like to point out
that this affected all of us.

859
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,879
All our board, our managers,
including myself.

860
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,680
Our pensions were depleted overnight.

861
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,269
- Diane.
- Our savings gutted just like yours.

862
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,555
Wait. Wait. I'm sorry.

863
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,080
Are you trying to make
me feel sorry for you?

864
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,231
Is that really what's happening right now?

865
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,118
- DIANE: No, I just...
- That's exactly what's happening.

866
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,600
DIANE: I understand you want specifics.

867
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,351
Yeah. So why doesn't
she give him some specifics?

868
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,949
DIANE: We know this was
a completely isolated incident.

869
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,838
It's what we call a black swan.

870
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,960
It's impossible to predict,
but it's impossible to replicate.

871
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,633
"Black swan"?

872
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,790
PATTY: That's her memo.

873
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,519
She's reading from her memo.

874
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,597
Diane. Diane.
We both read your talking points.

875
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,435
He doesn't want some PR spin about
what's gonna go right next year.

876
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,274
He wants an explanation
for what went wrong last week.

877
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,350
KYLE: Yeah.

878
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,156
DIANE: Right, I understand.
And we believe in complete transparency.

879
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,640
That's why we disclosed...

Where are your quants, Diane?
Where are your quants?

881
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,958
- That's good. Go with that. Get an answer.
- DIANE: I'm sorry?

882
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,110
- Yeah.
- The quants you used.

the algorithm that crashed.

I'd like to ask him a few questions.

No, um, these are our administrative

Okay, then where is he? Is he in Mumbai?

Russia? Yeah, he's in Russia.
They're all in Russia.

DIANE: I'm not sure.

890
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,310
But if you'd like to talk to someone,
then I can make that happen.

891
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,393
No, I don't want to talk to
some low-level schlub, God damn it.

892
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,153
I want an explanation from you!

893
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,392
And if you can't give me one,
then I want to talk to Walt Camby.

894
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,994
No, I'm sorry,

895
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,117
- but Walt is on a plane right now.
- God damn...

bullshit over and over again, Lee.

- KYLE: Don't tell me to wait!

00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,877
He just shot out your monitor on the stage

902
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,395

the same corporate bullshit!

Don't talk to me about delicate situations!

I'm gonna be upfront with you.

974

I don't want you to do it
because you're gonna make money.

- Where's my stock price?
- DAVE: Just got it up.

981
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,709
It's simple math. Value comes from demand.

982
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,713
So if every single one of you
buys a few shares,

983
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,638
then we can get the price
of this sucker up in no time.

984
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,473
And here's the crazy part.

985
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,234
If we do it and everybody invests
just a little bit of money,

986
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,676
the price starts to go up.

987

Listen, lady,
I'm not getting mixed up in all this.

1245
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,751
I was hired to design a program.
My job was about data.

1246
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,036
It was about math.
It was about theoreticals. That's it.

1247

Yes, but this glitch was still a result
of a program you designed.

Wrong. It's user error.

Lee?

1654
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:12,232
Lee, are you there? If you can
hear me, put your hand in the air.

1655
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19,794
Okay. I can see you, but
I can't get to you.

1657
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,712
What am I gonna do?

1658
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,673
We either keep going or we stop.
It's up to you.

ESU, forward.

1661
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,554
First window we get,
we're taking the assailant down.

1662
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:44,756
CAPTAIN POWELL: Move them back.

1663
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,072
- OFFICER 1: Stay down.
- OFFICER 2: Stay behind the car.

01:17:58,120 --> 01:17:59,634
PATTY: Diane, are you still there?

1665
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:00,710
Yeah, I'm here.

1666
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,632
Okay. We are on Mambo.

1667
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,632
Our van can't get any closer.

1668
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,040
So keep Walt there.

1669
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,959
Do not let him run before
Lee can get to you.

1670
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:10,520
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

1671
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,875
All right. Get on it, Dave.

1672
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,599
Print out everything you can
on this miners' strike.

1673
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,672
- I'm gonna need that, too.
- Okay.

1674
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:17,876
Lee?

1675
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,353
You can hear me now.

1676
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,158
Which is good.

1677
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,113
I have a lot to explain,

1678
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,432
and I need you to listen
very carefully for once.

1679
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,480
We're approaching Federal Hall.

1680
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,556
Jesus. Is that live?

1681
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,800
Mmm-hmm. It is now.

1682
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,874
PATTY: Did you get all that?
And that's before we start digging.

1683
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,998
- Ibis is a pig in a prom dress, Lee.
- Got it.

1684
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,673
We are trying to find the proof right now.

1685
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,559
See if you can get those hacker guys.
Find out what they've come up with.

1686
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,950
Now, Lee,
we're making a pretty big leap here.

1687
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:54,551
So if Walt's gonna hang himself,
you're gonna have to hand him that rope.

1688
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:58,196
I'll just point the camera in your
direction, and we'll figure it out together.

1689
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,597
Hey. Get ready for a show.

1690
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,752
NEWSCASTER:
Well, these guys are certainly behaving

1691
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,231
like they've got an appointment
with the Ibis Clear Capital CEO.

1692
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,630
Which begs the question
on everyone's mind,

1693
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,473
- where is Walt Camby?
- (DOOR OPENS)

1694
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,639
MALE REPORTER: As a curious crowd
assembles outside Federal Hall,

1695
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,120
the missing piece of the puzzle...

1696
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,395
I trusted you.

1697
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,472
Yeah, well, I trusted you, too.

1698
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,997
So I guess that means we're both wrong.

1699
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,314
What did you do, Diane?
I mean, you know me.

1700
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,391
You know me better than my wife.

1701
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,551
- You know me better than anybody.
- I'm not so sure that's true.

1702
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,116
I have no idea what you think I did.

1703
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,714
Save it for the cameras, Walt.

1704
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,474

may just have the answer.

AMY LEE: (ON TV) Walt Camby?

1706
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:46,037
He's inside. He just went up those stairs
and through those doors.

1707
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:47,110
- REPORTER: You saw him?
- AMY LEE: That's right.

1708
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,157
Guess there's nowhere to run now, huh?

1709
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:52,199
This story does seem to be coming
to some sort of head down here.

1710
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,640
- Hey there, big shot.
- Hey.

01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,154
- LEE: Ready for that interview now?
- Hey.

01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,840
How was Geneva?

1715
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,515
- It was fine.
- Yeah, I hear it's lovely this time of year.

1716
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:30,910
Can we get him a chair?

- Sam, give him a chair.

Everywhere he's traveled.
There's way too much stuff.

Okay, well, just focus on the last 48
hours. And cue up the video package.

Can we get everybody outta here?

1724
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,433
Young lady, please, exit the building.

01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,920
WALT: Wait a second,
why does she get to leave?

1726
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,673
This might be able to help
with your investigation.

1727
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,399
This is all her fault.

1728
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,834
Go ahead, Diane, walk away.

1729
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,513
You're the only reason we're
stuck here with this psycho.

You wanted transparency, Walt?
Well, here's your chance.

Okay, now look, everything is fine.

1734
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:08,154
So why don't we just put the weapons down,
and let's just talk about it.

1735
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:11,312
No, I... I think we can talk
with the weapons up. Right, guys?

- This is Money Monster, coming to you live.
- KYLE: Back off.

1737
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:16,956
We're here with Ibis CEO Walt Camby.

1738
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,555
So, Walt,
now that we have you here in person,

1739
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:22,235
we can finally ask the
$800 million question.

1740
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:24,754
What happened at Ibis, Walt?

1741
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:30,470
As we've been saying since day one,
this was an isolated computer glitch.

1742
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,557
Goddamn it!

1743
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:34,393
- Glitch!
- He doesn't really like that word.

1744
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,119
I fuckin' hate that word!

1745
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,435
Oh, not the glitch.

1746
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,239
- Cue up video one.
- KYLE: I fucking hate that word.

1747
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,357
And then line the rest
of 'em up on my mark.

1748
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:45,151
You tried to convince us it's all too
complicated for us to understand.

1749
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,837
But it's not that
complicated at all, is it?

1750
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,040
It's actually the oldest story
in the book. Fraud.

1751
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,911
You took money out of your fund
and you invested it here.

1752
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,150
Go.

1753
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:00,311
Right here in platinum mines in South
Africa. Does that sound familiar?

1754
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,635
I don't have our portfolio in front of me.
I can't exactly...

1755
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:07,316
You really need your portfolio
to know where you put $800 million?

1756
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,352
I don't put that much money anywhere.

1757
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,715
The algorithms control our day-to-day...

1758
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,918
But that's not how high-frequency trading
is supposed to work, is it?

1759
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,071
They don't just put that much money
in one place

1760
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,032
and just leave it there, do they?

1761
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:21,755
It wasn't the algos pullin' the strings,
it was you.

1762
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,959
The miners' union strike here
outside Johannesburg is on its second week.

1763
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,238
You. You bought and paid
for a two-week strike.

1764
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,913
Oh, come on. This is ridiculous.

1765
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,350
Go.

1766
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,598
The strike had caused
the mining company's stock to drop.

1767
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:38,713
You buy low, you get the strike to stop,
you sell high.

1768
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,030
That's the plan.

1769
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,279
You make one big bribe to the right guy,
line your own pockets,

1770
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,510
and no one'll be the wiser.

1771
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:47,997
You're making accusations
that have no basis in reality.

1772
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,116
Video three on my mark.

1773
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,839
- All right, all right, all right. One...
- Get it together.

1774
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:52,513
- Okay, it's there. Got it.
- WALT: It's defamation, okay?

1775
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,590
And there are laws about that.

1776
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,478
Go on, Walt.
Tell me about all the laws I'm breaking.

1777
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,119
PATTY: Ready when you are, Lee.
On your mark.

1778
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:58,310
Look, I'll give you this.

1779
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,871
There really was a glitch in your system.
It just wasn't the computer.

1780
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,633
It was this guy. Moshe Mambo.

1781
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:04,870
We must say no!

1782
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:10,510
We must say no to their businesses!
We must say no to their bribes!

1783
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,513
You tried to bribe the one guy
that couldn't be bought.

1784
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,240
MAMBO: All they care about is money!

1785
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:21,073
If it takes two years,
if it takes 20 years,

1786
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:26,078
we will stay here and strike
until our voices are heard.

1787
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,310
Pause.

1788
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,277
There. Right there. That's your glitch.

1789
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,513
Because that's what sent
the mining company's stock plummeting,

1790
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,069
which sent
your secret $800 million investment

1791
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:38,560
right into the toilet.

1792
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,512
Want me to keep goin'?

1793
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,355
- Patty. You gotta see this.
- LEE: You made people a lot of money, Walt.

1794
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:47,638
You just needed to wreck industries and destroy
economies all over the world to do it.

1795
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,952
Okay. Get that ready right now. Lee?

1796
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:52,960
You're gonna say everything I say.

1797
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,030
WALT: This is insane.

1798
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:57,512
I don't know the first thing
about some South African workers' strike.

1799
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,876
I've never even heard of this Mambo.

1800
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,152
- Really? Never?
- Really? Never?

1801
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,959
Well, what were you two arguing about
this morning?

1802
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,794
Then what were you two arguing about
this morning

1803
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:09,833
- at 8:02 a.m., local time?
- (INAUDIBLE)

1804
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,196
Or maybe they're speaking Swahili
in Geneva these days.

1805
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:15,239
They don't speak Swahili
in South Africa, either.

1806
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:17,396
(SIGHS)

1807
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:19,153
And this wasn't the first time
you did it, either.

1808
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,875
This was just the first
time it didn't work out.

1809
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,959
You feel that, Walt?

1810
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:29,196
That sticky heat
risin' up the back of your neck?

1811
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,153
That flop sweat?

1812
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,834
That's fear.

1813
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,471
Greed you're already acquainted with.

1814
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:42,320
That's all a great story, Lee. I'm

I welcome the money and the cash

1978
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,956
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

1979
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,997
I welcome the money and the cash

1980
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,312
At the welcome mat swollen fat

1981
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,631
In stupid stacks, the cash

1982
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:12,030
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

1983
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,316
I welcome the money and the cash

1984
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:16,750
Wall Street is rigged like a 14-wheeler

1985
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,991
No one gets the plot,
and we're not revealing

1986
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:21,595
We got to live like emperors,
we ain't going down

1987
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,911
We stay in the 1%, you under it

1988
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,639
It's like they sent the hellhounds

1989
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:28,110
On an ice cream cone
how the global meltdown

1990
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,237
Financially, they ain't catching me

1991
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:32,556
They can't capture a phantom
they haven't seen

1992
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,916
Fuss with your folks all day for crumbs

1993
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,912
You work, we play, hooray for us

1994
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,469
We're the master puppeteers
with the leverage

1995
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,995
Sneak up behind and get a wedgie in

1996
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,117
With technology people are obsolete

1997
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,476
Fossil fuels is all you are to me

1998
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,631
Hugs go out to the world, I love you, fam

1999
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:51,076
Backslide your cash,
I call that sleight of hand

2000
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:53,231
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

2001
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:55,471
I welcome the money and the cash

2002
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:57,711
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

2003
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,951
I welcome the money and the cash

2004
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:02,396
At the welcome mat swollen fat

2005
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,392
In stupid stacks, the cash

2006
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,711
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

2007
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,792
I welcome the money and the cash

2008
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,520
Call us super rich, we're hero to y'all

2009
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,831
We hedge bets, scalp
You give your half off

2010
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:16,156
Trust us, of course we'll give y'all a job

2011
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:18,880
One day you too can live high on the hog

2012
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,156
Wrong, you get left in the hole starving

2013
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,311
Hit the margin, so what?
That's your problem

2014
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,676
Hoard that bread just like the nasty hooker

2015
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,956
Heels crack the concrete,
she walkin' crooked

2016
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:30,316
Lookit, all the assholes you see as stars

2017
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,676
All gonna be broke, yep, the world is ours

2018
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,877
Put a twist on it too, like a Hefty bag

2019
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,156
In the end, it's fittin',
what's left is trash

2020
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:39,357
Whistleblowers hiss like cobras

2021
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,636
If we sense resistance, it's over

2022
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,831
Bull market, bear market

2023
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,832
Wild kingdom, yes, you the target

2024
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,071
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

2025
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:50,431
I welcome the money and the cash

2026
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,512
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

2027
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:55,035
I welcome the money and the cash

2028
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:57,157
At the welcome mat, swollen fat

2029
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:59,357
In stupid stacks, the cash

2030
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,591
My money ain't funny and it keep coming

2031
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:04,275
I welcome the money and the cash
