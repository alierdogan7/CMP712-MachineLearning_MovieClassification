00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:15,208
I can't.

<i>"Nothing can kill us.
We can't never die."</i>

13
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,643
<i>The reason being
that in the great war,</i>

14
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,903
<i>my eldest brother, Howard,
saw his entire battalion</i>

16
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,357
<i>Every last one of them.</i>

17

<i>He was the only survivor.</i>

18
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,866

that same year,</i>

<i>It got Ma and Pa and Forrest</i>

22
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,381
<i>but against all the odds,</i>

23
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,133
<i>he somehow managed
to fight it off.</i>

24
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,465

32
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,773
- Morning, Forrest.
HOWARD: - Pure corn whiskey.

33
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,316
That there's the white lightning, Sheriff.

34
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,904
It'll come at you like a knife,

35
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,785
pointy end first,
sharp and hot all the way down.

36
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,992
Aw, damn it. Give me two.

37
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,201
All right, then.

38
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,455
- You all right there?
SHERIFF: - Thanks, boys.

39
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,836
Always happy to oblige

51

off the streets like candy.</i>

Tommy Maloy,</i>

JACK: Ain't like someone's gonna steal
this piece of shit, Forrest.

65
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,505
Just do what you're told, Jack.

66

Here we go. All right, then.

72
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,301
Get some of this.

73
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,971
Welcome, welcome.
How're you boys doing?

74
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,931
Sorry to hear about Little Bean,
Ida Belle.

75
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:47,064
You know Little Bean loved
his gals and his giggle water.

76
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,983
HOWARD: She sure is giving him
one hell of a send-off.

MAN: Give me your money, boy.

78
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,405
Yeah, you do as I say

79
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,114
or I'm gonna cut you.
- Hold on, now, I ain't got nothing.

80
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,823
I'm just a driver.

81

You boys staying?

82
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,947
No, we gotta be getting off, Ida Belle.

83
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,411
Come on, Forrest, one damn drink.

84
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,951
No, we better be getting back now.

85
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,336
You ever seen a Harlem sunset?

86
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,462
Well, I'm fixing
to cut one right into you...

87
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,622
I ain't got nothing.

88
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,336
...If you don't hand over
that goddamn money.

89
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,341
HOWARD: Motherfucker.

90
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,877
Here, I'll take care of this.

91

Hey you, come on now,
you don't want to do this.

92
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,098
Why don't you put that knife away,
take you and your friends on home?

93
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,305
I'd listen to him if I was you.

94

MAN: You the boss?

95
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,932
You just sold a load to those
dinges in there, didn't you?

96
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,607
You hand over that cash or I'm gonna
cut some daylight into you.

97
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,857
Listen here, mister.

98
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,321
We got no way of
understanding this world.

99
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,871
We got about as much sense of it
as a bird flying in the sky.

100
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,490
There is a lot that bird don't know.

101
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,704
But it don't change the fact that

102
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,167
the world is happening to him
all the same.

103
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,042
What I'm trying to say is...

104
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:58,085
...is that the course of your life,
it is changing.

105
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,050
- You don't even see it.
- What are you talking about?

106
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,507
(grunts, spits)

107
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,515
MAN: Let's go!

108
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,560
HOWARD: Yep.
That's what he's talking about.

109
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,693
(man gurgling)
- Yeah, all right now.

110
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,194
HOWARD: You all right there, Jack?

111
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,567
Just caught me off guard is all.

112
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,279
You still good to drive?

113
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,985
- Fuck you, Howard.
HOWARD: - Oh, whatever you say,

114
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,701
- Little doggie.
(Forrest laughing)

115
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,218
(bluegrass playing)
(people chattering, laughing)

116
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,694
All right, Jack, come on,
we gotta go set up over here.

117
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,204
HOWARD: Thank you.

118
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,623
Finest apple?

119
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,959
MAN: All right, then.

120
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,764
Are you gonna talk to Forrest about
taking some of me and Cricket's liquor?

121
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,517
- We're working on somethin' big.
- What do you mean talk to him?

122
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,098
About letting us in, Howard.

123
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,104
Not with that damn popskull shit
you been cooking up.

124
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,265
- We're still perfecting it.
- Perfecting it, my ass,

125
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,026
Jack, that shit
ain't fit to slop hogs.

126
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,108
Forrest don't want you involved, is all.

127
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,272
JACK: Why is that?

128
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,607
'Cause he don't think you got the grit.

129
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,993
Gimme another jar, Jack. Huh?

130
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,327
JACK: You might wanna slow down some,
Howard. We're trying to sell this stuff.

131
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,209
- Who is that?
HOWARD: - She's one of them crazies

132
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,291
from that church at Burnt Chimney.

133
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,174
Her daddy over there,
he's gonna be the preacher.

134
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,885
You wanna get yourself a crowbar, Jack,
if you wanna get inside of her.

135
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,142
(laughing) She don't
look that crazy.

136
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,723
Her daddy don't look too happy, neither.

137
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,306
(clears throat)

138
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,646
FORREST: All right, now.

139
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,358
Jack, go on and
take this around the back.

140
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,147
Store whatever's left in the shed.

141
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,442
You too, Howard.
(whistles)

142
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,161
HOWARD: - Come on, Jack.
JACK: - Yeah.

143
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,873
Are you Forrest Bondurant?

144
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,005
Um...

145
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,921
I'm Maggie Beaufort.

146
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,980
They say in town you're looking for
someone to help out 'round the place.

147
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:06,027
(clears throat)
- Is that position still vacant?

148
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,442
Forgive me for asking, but, um...

149
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,696
...what does a lady like you...

150
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,581
...want here?

151
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,834
The city can grind a girl down.

152
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,918
Gets to a point where you start
looking for somewhere quiet.

153
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,209
(Howard laughing)

154
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,087
Damn.

155
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,969
MAGGIE: Well, Mr. Bondurant...

156
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,276
...do I get the job?

157
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,354
(mumbles)

158

Hey!

167
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,466
Cricket!

168
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,221
Hey!

- Hey!
(shouts)

170
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,144
You ain't never gonna believe
what I just seen.

171

Floyd Banner shoot the tires
out of a goddamn ATU car

172
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,780
right smack in the middle of
town with a goddamn Tommy gun.

173
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,030
- Floyd Banner?
- Floyd Banner.

174
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,819
Oh, hey, look here. In the middle
of all that, I was thinking about you.

175
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,245
Got you one of these shell cases, Cricket.

176
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,576
- Oh, thanks, Jack!
- Yeah.

177
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,578
Figured we could put holes in it,
you know.

178
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,285
Put a chain through it, hang it around
our necks for luck or something.

179
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:52,545
(exhales) Floyd Banner.
He looked like he had direction, vision.

180
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,087
You got smoke coming out the cabin.

181
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,890
JACK: Jesus Christ, Cricket.

182
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,972
(grunts, coughs)

183
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,262
- This gonna work?
- Naturally,

184
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,602
I'm still messing with
the recipe, of course.

185
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,808
And with this set-up through the pipes,

186
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,852
no one'll even know it's down here.

187
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,068
(pipes groaning)

188
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,204
The man tucks away his bottle,
out he goes.

189
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,251
Well... Partner, I don't know if
that's the stupidest thing I ever seen

190
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,415
or you're some kind
of damn genius.

191
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,303
- Ooh.
- Mm-hm.

192
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,095
FORREST: Did Jimmy pay us?

193
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,355
HOWARD: - Yup.
FORREST: - He did?

194
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,075
HOWARD: Thank you.

195
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,000
(groans)

196
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,128
MAN: Hi, Forrest.

197
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,515
This here's the new Special Deputy.

198
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,683
He's been brought in
from the city to help us out.

199
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,979
You know, make sure things go smooth.

200
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,692
What things might they be?

201
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,114
(chuckles)

202
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,820
Sorry, something amuse you?

203
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,621
My name is Charlie Rakes,
I'm from Chicago.

204
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,208
That damn brother of yours,
is he somewhere about?

205
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:41,668
Who's in the car?

206
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,221
That there's the new
Commonwealth's Attorney, Mason Wardell.

207
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:50,601
He wants to work it out so everybody
gets to do some business.

208
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,357
SHERIFF: Henry,
go see what Mr. Wardell wants.

209
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,620
Pete, who the hell is this son of a bitch?

210
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:16,537
Me? I'm the one who's going to make
your life real difficult from now on

211
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,125
if you don't toe the line, country boy.

212
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,759
Don't you ever touch me again.

213
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:28,014
(laughing)
- All right, all right.

214
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,596
Forrest, it already settled.

215
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,102
The whole county's gonna
get on board eventually.

216
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,435
Start at $20 a week, $30 a load

217
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,565
and that gets you free passage
throughout the whole county.

218
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,523
- No one'll bother you.
- Don't nobody bother me now.

219
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:47,025
Mr. Wardell, he'd like a jar
of your finest apple brandy.

220
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,534
That be all right?

221
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,838
(low groan)

222
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,895
Can I help you, son?

223
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,521
Yeah.

224
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,479
You send your clown
with the bow tie around here again,

225
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,815
and I guarantee you'll personally
pull a cleaver out of his fucking skull.

226
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,275
You understand me?

227
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,073
PETE: You're gonna regret this, Forrest.

228
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,329
RAKES: He's already regretting it,
he's just too ignorant to know it yet.

229
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,488
Go on, go inside now.

230
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,453
(chuckling)

231
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,545
You thinking of drawing on me?

232
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,650
(train whistle in distance)

233
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,994
Say your piece, Jimmy.
I got a business to run.

234
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,123
JIMMY: All right, Forrest.
Now we got a chance

235
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,580
to make a good stack of money
here while the getting is good.

236
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,711
But for things to run smooth,

237
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,293
you got to grease the tracks.

238
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,879
Yeah, I hear what
you're saying, Jimmy, and...

239
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,930
...we go back a long way, so I'm not
gonna make a big deal out of this,

240
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,507
but, uh...

241
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,097
...I'm a Bondurant.

242
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,145
And we don't lay down for nobody.

243
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,902
<i>We'll continue to operate
free and clear here, as always.</i>

244
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,858
Me, I'll never pay no money
to no Mason Wardell

245
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,367
or the next damn bloodsucker
come after him.

246
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,904
I never have, I never will.

247
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,749
I'm sorry you feel that way,
Forrest.

248
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,878
Jimmy, do you have something
that you really wanna say to me?

249
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,626
You can't do it
the old way no more.

250
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,757
I remember there was a time
you had some balls, Jimmy.

251
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,293
(chuckles)

252
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,427
(indistinct chatter)

253
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,014
Well, I guess we'll see what happens.
(clears throat)

254
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,427
Gentlemen.

255
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,647
PETE: Look, Deputy, we've got
something of a problem here.

256
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:34,363
It's Special Deputy, and
I don't see a problem at all.

257
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,737
I hear these mountain boys
have got, uh...

258
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,951
...injun blood in them.

259
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,914
Cherokee. This would explain
why they're a little...

260
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,579
...animalistic in their nature.

261
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,965
I don't rightly understand
what you mean.

262
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:53,215
But there's a feeling around
these parts that Forrest Bondurant

263
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,471
is different than other folks.

264
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,966
- Different?
- Indestructible.

265
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,805
(chuckles)
Do you mean "immortal"?

266
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,973
(high-pitched chuckle)

267
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:12,397
Shit. You fucking hicks are
a sideshow unto yourselves.

268
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,911
Sheriff, you have any idea

269
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,368
what a Thompson submachine gun
does to "immortal"?

270
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,502
Well, this ain't Chicago.
You can't just shoot him.

271
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,504
Do that, people around here
will string us up from a tree.

272
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,881
Do I look stupid to you?

273
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,799
I've been brought in to do a job.

274
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,592
And I know just who to start with.

275
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,138
You know something?

276
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,396
I don't much like you.

277
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,483
Yeah, well, not many do.

278
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:13,170
HOWARD: - Gimme some of that.
MAN: - Yeah, it's good.

279
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,094
I could run them blockades.

280
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,096
(chuckling)

281
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:27,014
- You? A blockader? Shit.
JACK: - What do you mean "shit"?

282
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,524
Danny, I can drive a damn sight
better than you can.

283
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,651
Just not in the shitcan we got.

284
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,780
Oh, yeah? Well, Forrest,
he don't wanna hear about it.

285
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:39,613
Yeah, well...
the hell with Forrest.

286
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,028
I'm sick of being his house dog.

287
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:49,497
You gonna tell him that?
Or you want me to do that, too?

288
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,460
(coughing)

289
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,132
HOWARD: You all right there, Jack?

290
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,885
Shut up, Howard.

291
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,920
Forrest ain't got no aspirations.

292
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,966
He still sleeps on a mattress on the floor
like a fucking Chinaman.

293
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,807
You might wanna watch your mouth there,
little brother.

294
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,473
(laughing)
- Fuck off, Howard.

295
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,104
- Oh, come on.
- Stop. Stop.

296
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,686
It's... (laughing)

297
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,150
Where are you going with that stuff?

298
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,984
Church.

299
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,620
HOWARD: Hell, you better take
it easy on that jar then!

300
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,906
(laughing)

301
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,085
(people singing in distance,
indistinct)

302
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,675
(indistinct singing continues)

303
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:56,106
(indistinct singing continues)

304
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:20,547
<i>♪ He gave a peace</i>

305
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:25,385
<i>♪ Of the world ♪</i>

306
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,061
Let us pray.

307
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,683
If any man loved the world,

308
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,477
the love of the Father
is not in him.

309
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,031
For all that is in the world,

310
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:46,990
the lust of the flesh
and the lust of the eyes

311
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,154
and the pride of life

312
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,746
is not of the Father,
but is of the world.

313
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,876
(woman coughing)

314
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,127
Amen.

315
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,210
Thirty-nine, top.

316
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,926
(people vocalizing)

317
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,103
(people singing, indistinct)

318
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,988
(coughing, gagging)

319
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:24,501
(coughing)

320
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,225
Too much rust
in the tank, maybe.

321
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,854
(vehicle approaching)

322
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,532
- Or lead.
(car door closes)

323
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,587
Mind if I come in?

324
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,252
Don't expect no biscuits
coming out around here.

325
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,302
- Who's that?
- Aunt Winnie.

326
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,726
Why don't you tell Aunt Winnie
this is not a social visit.

327
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,728
Well, I ain't sure
that'll do no good, sir.

328
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,106
She ain't right in the head.

329
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,863
Three things you gotta tell us, son.

330
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:32,071
Where's the still, where's the
liquor and where's the money?

331
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,664
(Sighs)

332
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,618
JACK: He don't have it.

333
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,289
Now who might you be?

334
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,173
That there is Jack Bondurant.

335
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,337
Well, I'll be damned.

336
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,723
I was told I'd find you here.

337
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,392
And look...

338
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:01,972
...here you are.

339
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,268
Go find the still,
leave us alone.

340
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,448
So, the runt of the litter.

341
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:22,960
- You boys don't get it, do you?
(screen door shuts)

342
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,870
Look at me, son.

343
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,466
Oh, you're a peach.

344
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,305
What's going on?

345
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,558
Come closer.

346
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,812
Step forward.

347
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,534
Stop right there.

348
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,498
(grunts)

349
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:12,467
(impact sounds) (Jack grunting)

350
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,012
- Get up.
(clanging)

351
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,474
(groaning)

352
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,268
I thought they said you
Bondurant boys were

353
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,303
a bunch of hard-boiled
sons of bitches.

354
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,111
(grunting) (hissing, clanging)

355
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,856
Oh, this is terrible.

356
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,198
This just won't do.

357
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,866
(grunts, screams)

358
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,755
My brothers are gonna get you.

359
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,590
They're gonna kill you.

360
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,379
Is that so?

361
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,719
(groaning)
- It's not gonna help right now, is it?

362
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,561
Why don't you tell
those brothers of yours

363
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,892
we're coming for them next.

364
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,107
You tell 'em.

365
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:19,072
No more!

366
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,283
No more, please.
Please.

367
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,824
(whimpering)

368
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,242
Don't touch me!

369
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,508
Next time I come down real hard.

370
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,190
All right.

371
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,988
So you want to
get into this racket.

372
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,988
But I see you sitting there,

373
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,027
looking like somebody's
punching bag.

374
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,748
Sol ask you...

375
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,707
...what do you
intend to do now?

376
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,757
- What do I intend to do?
- Yeah.

377
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,090
You.

378
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,924
You expect somebody else
to handle it?

379
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,593
- No.
- Howard, maybe?

380
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,682
- That ain't what I meant.
- What did you mean?

381
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,847
I don't need no help.

382
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,057
FORREST: I'm sorry?

383
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:18,111
- I don't need no help.
- Oh, you don't?

384
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,404
Here it is.

385
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,072
As long as you are my brother,

386
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,616
you will never let this happen
again, do you understand?

387
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,872
- I get it.
- I don't think you do.

388
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,960
What if I can't?

389
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,711
I mean, I ain't... I'm not
built like you and Howard.

390
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,717
I ain't never been like you.

391
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,473
It's all right.

392
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,688
Jack...

393
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:00,396
...it is not the violence
that sets a man apart.

394
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:04,237
All right? It is the distance
that he is prepared to go.

395
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,446
Jack, look at me.

396
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,741
We're survivors.

397
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,909
We control the fear.

398
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,749
And without the fear,

399
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,586
we are all as good as dead.

400
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,388
Do you understand?

401
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,093
- Do you?
- Rakes told me to tell you

402
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,099
they're coming for you next.

403
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:31,843
Hm.

404
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,765
Yeah, well, they'll be back,
you can be sure of that.

405
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,737
Um...

406
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,536
A present from
your preacher friend.

407
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,250
You gonna open it?

408
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:08,347
(chuckling)

409
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:09,882
Fuck you, Howard.

410
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,641
HOWARD: Ah, damn.

411
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,568
(door closes)

412
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,814
(car approaching)

413
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,838
(car doors closing)

414
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,179
Forrest Bondurant.

415
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:01,521
It seems you've been involved
in certain illegal activities.

416
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,903
Illegal activities?

417
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,859
MAN: Look here, Forrest,
if you play ball with us,

418
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:13,029
we can make this here
summons disappear.

419
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,032
Are you trying
to shake me down, Henry?

420
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,786
I'm just the messenger here,
Forrest.

421
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,375
(door closes)

422
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:27,925
Have you met Howard?

423
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,256
(footsteps approaching)

424
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,513
Oh, what?
You gonna shoot me, huh?

425
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,844
FORREST: Howard! Howard!
(grunting)

426
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:36,176
HOWARD: Huh? Huh?

427
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,220
(men grunting)

428
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:41,856
Huh? You gonna
hurt my brother?!

429
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:46,153
Huh? You trying to intimidate
us, Sheriff? Huh?

430
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,280
The Bondurants?

431
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,243
All right now.
That's enough now.

432
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,406
You gonna sell out
like them other Cocksuckers?

433
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,416
(grunting, gagging)
- Huh?

434
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,667
FORREST: That's enough now.

435
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,669
Howard, that's enough.

436
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,085
- All right.
(man panting)

437
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,930
You old piece of shit.

438
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,558
FORREST: Now, y'all oughta know better
than to come around here

439
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,560
when Howard's been on the
stump whiskey for a few days.

440
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,514
I think you might wanna
get out of here.

441
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:27,527
You give my regards

442
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:30,485
to Special Deputy Rakes.
HOWARD: - Oh, yeah.

443
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,158
It ain't nothing personal, Henry.

444
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,379
MAGGIE: He got that
special look in his eye.

445
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:51,509
No I don't.

446
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:52,920
- Yes, he does.
- Yes, you do.

447
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:56,757
(Jack laughs,
speaks indistinctly)

448
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,267
(all laughing)

449
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,317
I saw you
at the Bondurant place.

450
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,498
You're not from around here.

451
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,370
Chicago, right?

452
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,880
You were a dancer up there.

453
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,545
The Apex Club, wasn't it?

454
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:38,261
Did a little number
with feathers, I believe.

455
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,679
Something troubling you?

456
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,848
Get out of my way.

457
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,518
Oh, you don't
need to worry about me.

458
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,403
I ain't the kind to
drink from a greasy cup.

459
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,661
FORREST: Where's Jack?

460
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,031
I've seen him swanning
around in Daddy's old suit.

461
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,409
- Listen, Howard.
- Yeah?

462
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,045
I need you here
with me tonight...

463
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,043
I got some business with
a couple out-of-towners

464
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,544
I never dealt with before.

465
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,256
- Yeah? Where they from?
- Chicago.

466
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,640
Yeah, well, me and Danny, we just
gotta stop by the stills first.

467
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,552
You just be here by 11:00 now.
You got that?

468
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,268
HOWARD: I got it.
When have I ever let you down?

469
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,685
(♪ The Bootleggers featuring
Emmylou Harris: "Fire in the Blood")

470
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,422
How'd you like to come
for a ride with me sometime?

471
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,087
You must be jingle-brained
if you think I'm gonna

472
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,048
get in a car
with the likes of you.

473
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:05,094
Anyway, you oughta be worried
if my father catches you here.

474
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,019
Talking to me.

475
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,272
He's just in the feed store, there.

476
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,109
Why'd I need to be worried?

477
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,983
You know, coming to
the church meeting like that.

478
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,819
And bustin' out of there
like a crazy person.

479
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,033
Are you affected in the head?

480
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,946
Hold on, now, look here.
Look.

481
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:28,162
Crazy person wear a suit
as fancy as this?

482
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,043
Still don't explain why
you acted like a lunatic.

483
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,622
I didn't want
my feet washed, is all.

484
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,376
- I know who you are.
- Yeah? Who's that?

485
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:42,844
One of them Bondurant boys,
and that's enough.

486
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:46,010
There ain't many that have
a good word to say about you.

487
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:49,019
- Yeah?
- Except some rubbish about a legend.

488
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,055
Yeah.

489
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,476
About you guys being invincible
or some such nonsense.

490
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:58,146
- Say that word again. What'd you say?
- Invincible.

491
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,152
Well, shoot, I don't know
what that means.

492
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,155
Sounds good, though.

493
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:07,164
My daddy thinks you boys are
the worst thing ever to hit Franklin.

494
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,324
Well, what would your daddy know?

495
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:14,584
You sure got a funny way of courting,
Jack Bondurant.

496
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:18,000
That is what you're doing, right?
Courting?

497
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,676
Yeah.

498
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,765
All right, then.

499
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,890
You tell your daddy I said hi.

500
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,850
- Oh sh...
- Thank you.

501
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:39,445
(coyote howls)

502
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:44,200
(Howard mumbling)
(Ida Belle chuckling)

503
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,659
(indistinct slurring chatter)

504
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,708
- Oh!
- Woo!

505
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,211
(all laughing)

506
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,667
- Oh, shit!
(Howard, Ida Belle laughing)

507
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,898
Hey, Red.

508
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,654
Where them feathers at?

509
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,660
He's a crip.
Don't worry about it.

510
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:36,953
CRICKET: Hey, Forrest.

511
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,587
All right, go tell Maggie
to shut her down.

512
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,347
(clattering) (Maggie grunting)

513
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,770
All right now, that's enough.
Come on, now, get out of here.

514
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,061
(man panting)

515
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:01,273
I paid for another jar
and she won't give it.

516
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:05,282
- And then the bitch done me.
- No, you didn't.

517
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,818
We gonna buy near 100 gallons
of your liquor.

518
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:10,203
Now you ain't gonna
throw in some extra?

519

shoot that thing.

01:17:31,596 --> 01:17:34,349
It don't matter if I like it,
I can't wear this.

868
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:37,395
I just wanted to
get you something nice.

869
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:41,360
Where do you think I'd be able
to wear something like that?

870
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:44,572
I'll take you somewhere so you can
wear something like that every day.

871
01:17:48,029 --> 01:17:49,656
Why don't you try it on?

872
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,453
(exhales) What? Here?

873
01:17:54,619 --> 01:17:56,963
- Yeah, ain't nobody around.
- You're around.

874
01:17:57,122 --> 01:18:00,376
I... I'll just... listen to my radio,
look out at this tree here.

875
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:03,546
I won't look, you can go back
behind the car and put it on.

876
01:18:11,303 --> 01:18:14,477
All right, seeing as
you bought it and all.

878
01:18:29,946 --> 01:18:31,163
You better not look.

879
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:40,423
- You better not be looking.
- I'm not looking.

880
01:18:40,582 --> 01:18:43,051
Just over here at this
woodpecker on a tree.

881
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:58,141
Well?

882
01:18:59,934 --> 01:19:00,935
How do I look?

883
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:07,780
(music stops)

884
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:13,281
Come on.

Watch your step, here.
Whatcha think?

891
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:30,780
- What do I think about what?
- My place of employment.

892
01:20:33,945 --> 01:20:37,199
- Hey.
- Hot socks, Jack.

893
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:38,912
What's she doing here?

894
01:20:39,075 --> 01:20:43,171
Miss Bertha Minnix,
meet my partner, the Cricket Pate.

895
01:20:43,329 --> 01:20:45,502
Pleased to meet you, Cricket Pate.

896
01:20:47,459 --> 01:20:49,336
The pleasure's all mine, miss.

897
01:20:50,795 --> 01:20:53,389
(whispering) Boy, oh, boy, Jack, your
brothers are gonna shit their grits.

898
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:54,720
Don't you worry about it.

899
01:20:56,634 --> 01:20:58,386
This is it.

900
01:20:58,553 --> 01:21:00,521
- It's a real hideout.
CRICKET: - Howard's up in the look-out.

901
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,524
It's the biggest distillation
set-up in these hills.

902
01:21:03,683 --> 01:21:05,230
We're able to put
out 1,000 gallons a week.

903
01:21:05,393 --> 01:21:06,690
No one around here comes
close to doing that.

904
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:07,942
You're an outlaw, Jack.

905
01:21:08,104 --> 01:21:10,607
No, that's just a matter
of perspective.

906
01:21:10,773 --> 01:21:12,446
I'm just doing what
any man around here would do

907
01:21:12,609 --> 01:21:14,737
if he had the same
strength of character.

908
01:21:17,071 --> 01:21:19,290
You got it all figured out?

909
01:21:19,449 --> 01:21:20,917
Yeah.

910
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:28,754
Damned if your face don't
belong on a coin, Bertha.

911
01:21:30,502 --> 01:21:33,130
- Jack.
- I mean it.

as beautiful as you right here.</i>

- It's the law!
- What?

It's the law!

and some gal.

- Yep.

Keep on going.

964
01:26:11,532 --> 01:26:14,786
That friend of yours,
he called me a nance.

Why would he say that?

966

I don't know, sir.

967
01:26:19,582 --> 01:26:22,005
Maybe 'cause you smell funny.

your damn legs, anyway?

Calm down, Howard.
Go fetch the car.

I gotta find you lying
in a pool of your own blood?

1061

Drag your damn body into my car?

1062
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:42,983
Drive you down to the hospital,
your throat cut from ear to ear?

1063

You did that?

1064
01:35:52,488 --> 01:35:54,786

1211
01:46:48,184 --> 01:46:49,857
I'm gonna go get me some air.

1212
01:46:51,521 --> 01:46:53,523
- Do one move.
- No.

1213
01:46:53,690 --> 01:46:58,116
- Here we go, here we go! Oh, oh...
- Come on...

1214
01:46:58,278 --> 01:47:00,497
FORREST: - There ain't enough space.
(laughter)

1215
01:47:00,655 --> 01:47:02,953
HOWARD: Let him walk it off.

1216
01:47:04,868 --> 01:47:08,122
Yep, I'm gonna...
I'm going to bed, too.

1217
01:47:08,288 --> 01:47:11,963
It's too damn cold to be sitting
out here on this porch.

1218
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:15,133
Midnight's upon us already.

1219
01:47:16,713 --> 01:47:18,135
Night, Forrest.

1220
01:47:21,176 --> 01:47:22,849
- Night, Jack.
JACK: - Good night.

1221
01:47:29,309 --> 01:47:32,233
<i>JACK: Forrest once said
nothing could kill us,</i>

1222
01:47:32,395 --> 01:47:34,022
<i>that we could never die.</i>

1223
01:47:35,857 --> 01:47:38,326
<i>And back then I think
I actually believed it.</i>

1224
01:47:39,736 --> 01:47:41,579
<i>Hell, I know Forrest did.</i>

1225
01:47:44,157 --> 01:47:46,580
<i>'Cause no matter what
this world flung at him</i>

1226
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:50,755
<i>he seemed to be able to just
stand up and keep on going.</i>

1227
01:47:52,332 --> 01:47:54,175
<i>Getting a little more bent,</i>

1228
01:47:54,334 --> 01:47:56,211
<i>a little more twisted each time.</i>

1229
01:48:00,256 --> 01:48:02,884
<i>But nobody leaves
this world alive.</i>

1230
01:48:03,885 --> 01:48:06,104
<i>- Not even Forrest.
(ice cracking)</i>

1231
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:09,857
(groaning)

1232
01:48:24,322 --> 01:48:26,290
<i>JACK: And in the end,</i>

1233
01:48:26,449 --> 01:48:29,077
<i>it was dumb luck
and pneumonia that got him.</i>

1234
01:48:32,455 --> 01:48:35,459
<i>It was as simple
and indifferent as that.</i>

1235
01:48:40,964 --> 01:48:44,434
<i>Nowadays, we Bondurants
abide by the law.</i>

1236
01:48:44,592 --> 01:48:48,642
<i>People ain't trying to cut our throats,
stab us, shoot us no more.</i>

1237
01:48:52,058 --> 01:48:53,981
<i>Them days are long gone.</i>

1238
01:48:57,230 --> 01:48:58,903
<i>Sometimes when I'm out on the porch,</i>

1239
01:48:59,065 --> 01:49:01,944
<i>just sitting around doing nothing,</i>

1240
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:03,828
<i>hell...</i>

1241
01:49:03,987 --> 01:49:07,662
<i>...it sure does get
real quiet around here.</i>
