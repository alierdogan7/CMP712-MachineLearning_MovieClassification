(SIREN CONTINUES, LOUDER)

1005
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,888
Then Rebecca wanted
to go to Orlando Bloom's.

1006
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,123
We knew he was away, from the Internet.
You know, you Google his name...

1007
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:01,529
and it says Orlando Bloom's shooting a movie
in New York, and he's with Miranda Kerr.

1008
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,446
So we just walked in.
The door was unlocked. There was no alarm.

1009
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,249
The door was unlocked?

1010
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,523
I'm really sorry about what I did.

1011
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,602
Did you know
Rebecca was leaving the state?

1012
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,165
I... I just knew that she was going
to stay at her dad's...

1013
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,811
because she wasn't getting along
with her mom and her stepdad.

1014
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,008
You didn't know she was taking
stolen property...

1015
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:27,163
across state lines
and leaving you holding the bag?

1016
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,160
I thought she was just
gonna go see her dad.

(SIREN WAILING)

1018

Metro Police. Are you Rebecca Ahn?

1019
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,844
- Yes.
- We have a warrant to search the premises. Step aside.

1020
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,649

Jeff, upstairs. See what you find.

1023
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,244
Here's your warrant.

1024
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:09,005
Do you know why we're in your home,
serving you a search warrant?

1025
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:11,287
- Yes.
- Why do you think we're here?

1026
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:13,727
My friend Marc was arrested.
He called me from jail...

1027
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,246
and said the police had done
a search warrant on his home.

1028
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,806
- Do you know why?
- I've been watching <i>TMZ.</i>

1029
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,566
They've been saying I'm a person
of interest in these burglaries.

1030
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,211
Were you involved in these burglaries
of these celebrities?

1031
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,930
No, I wasn't.

1032
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:31,523
Is there going to be any property from
those burglaries in this residence?

1033
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,443
- No.
- Have you ever been...

1034
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,808
- to these celebrity homes that were burglarized?
- No.

of your fingerprints or D.N.A...

- No.

You boys having fun?
Find something interesting? What?

1038
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,691
- Yeah, we got a few things on the list.
- Right on.

1039
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,808
Anything else?

1040
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:55,965
- Yeah, we also came up with these.
- Nice.

1041
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,725
We found a jacket and jeans
that match a description by Lohan...

1042
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,406
and some personal photographs
of Paris Hilton.

1043

If I tell you where everything is,
would you let me go?

1044

Hypothetically, let's say I can
help you locate this property...

1045
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,651
and tell you who has it,
how would that help me?

- It was not good.

Okay, thank you.

So how is Sam related?

- I was friends with her mother.

- Mom, this is my interview.
- Okay.

1061
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,726
Yeah. So, she has been living with us.

1062
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,451
Um, we met when my parents divorced...

1063
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,000
and now my mom homeschools all of us.

1064
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,402
Based on the philosophy of <i>The Secret...</i>

1065
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:50,450
which is based on the laws of attraction.

1066
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,251
- Can I talk, please?
- Sure.

1067
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,891
I'm sorry.
(CHUCKLES)

1068
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,009
The reason that we related so well...

1069
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:03,244
is that my dad
is a recovering alcoholic...

1070
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,488
- and Sam's mom...
- She's a practicing...

1071
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:09,770
is a practicing drug addict and alcoholic.

1072
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,446
And our moms became, like, best friends.

1073
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:16,286
- We were, and she went off the deep end.
- Please!

1074
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,170
- So, basically you took her in.
NICKI: Yes.

1075
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,891
We took her in about six years ago.

1076
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,203
But let's, uh...
Let's... Let's get back to Nicki, okay?

(ALL CHUCKLE)

01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:31,130
Uh, so Adam here told me
that you do charity work.

1079
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,010
Yes. We do a lot of stuff
through our church.

1080
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,845
- Mm-hmm.
- It's called the Agape Church.

1081
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:40,129
- Right.
- It's the religious science philosophy...

1082
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,202
beneath <i>The Secret.</i>

1083
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:49,410
Um, my other sister, Gabby,
is on a trip with them building homes.

1084
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:52,643
And they do a yearly trip to Africa...

1085
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,883
where they build wells
and schools for kids.

1086
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,088
Which country?

1087
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:00,561
Um, I can't remember
exactly which country...

1088
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:06,807
but we do bake sales and, like, feeding
the homeless and that kind of stuff.

1089
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,201
Okay. So there's a little bit
of a disconnect...

1090
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,931
between your positive pursuits
and what's happening now.

1091
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,002
Nicki, I don't want you
to answer that comment.

1092
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,561
Well, I think that I am.

1093
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,563
Don't.

1094
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:22,166
I have, like,
a good statement to say about this.

1095
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,004
She could speak generally.

1096
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:27,846
I think this situation
was attracted into my life...

1097
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,208
as a huge learning lesson for me...

1098
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:36,127
to grow and expand
as a spiritual human being.

1099
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,409
I believe that I am an old soul.

You are, honey. She is.

1101
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,203
We've gotten to know
Nicki and her family...

1102
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,921
and we believe that she is an extremely
focused and honest young woman...

1103
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,128
who has a lot to offer the community.

1104
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,204
And we agree that there
has not been a disconnect.

1105
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,248
That there were circumstances
that happened...

1106
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,642
but Nicki herself
has continued to stay on her plane...

1107
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:01,770
despite the tumultuous
experiences happening.

1108
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,400
What's your goal, or life plan,
if you have one?

1109
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,484
I do. I think it's my journey...

1110
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,042
to push for peace
and the health of the planet.

1111
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:17,801
Nicki's expressed to me
a lot of her humanitarianism.

1112
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:20,281
It's my main goal.

1113
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,561
I... want to be a leader...

1114
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:29,850
and do things that people really notice.

1115
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:33,081
That's why I'm taking business-

1116
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:36,403
so that I can be a leader...

1117
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:40,280
and-and take a stand for people.

1118
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:45,765
But I went to Indian Hills
to learn and be with my peers...

1119
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,402
but I was always self-conscious that I wasn't,
you know, as good-looking as other people.

1120
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,164
And now you're a star.

1121
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,284
Yeah... On my Facebook page recently...

1122
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,011
I had over 800 friend requests.

1123
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:00,441
I accepted them all.
I mean, I didn't even look at them.

1124
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,533
- And then I noticed someone
had created a fan page for me.

1125
01:14:03,559 --> 01:14:04,311
- Hmm.

1126
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:08,649
It's just kind of awkward
that so many people are loving me...

1127
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,840
for... for something
that's so looked down on in society.

1128
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:14,362
If it had been, you know, something
that were to benefit the community...

1129
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:17,125
or something like that, I'd love it.

1130
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,806
But it's kind of showing America has this.

1131
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:23,805
This sick fascination
with a Bonnie and Clyde kind of thing.

FEMALE NEWSCASTER: <i>Members of
the Bling Ring were sentenced today...</i>

1198
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,202
<i>for their role in a rash of break-ins...</i>

1199
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:10,171
<i>that netted more than
three million in high-end goods.</i>

1200
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:48,002
We're here with Nicki Moore, who just served 30
days for her involvement in the Bling Ring...

1201
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:51,926
and shared a cellblock
with one of its victims, Lindsay Lohan.

1202
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,731
There were reports
that Lindsay was crying.

1203
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:59,044
With you being next to her,
did you actually hear any of this?

1204
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,203
Yeah. I could hear her crying
the first day...

1205
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:06,205
which is really hard
when you're just trying to be strong.

1206
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:10,126
But I just really kept to myself...

1207
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,249
and just tried to get through the day.

1208
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:16,881
It's hard when you're
woken up at, like, 5:30.

1209
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,803
And how'd she look?

1210
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,201
She got to keep her extensions in.

1211
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:25,490
A lot of the girls were talking-“Oh,
I had to take my weave out,” or whatever.

1212
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:29,121
But, um, she was in orange like all of us.

1213
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,567
Now, were you nervous being next to her?

1214
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:35,406
Because you actually were accused
of being a part of the group...

1215
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,403
that allegedly robbed her house.

1216
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:42,407
Yeah. I mean, it was scary for me.

1217
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:46,451
They were showing the surveillance video.

1218
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:50,161
They were showing the story
on TVs inside...

1219
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:53,403
and, you know, little do people know...

1220
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:56,768
that when that first video came out...

1221
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:00,242
I was actually in contact
with her manager...

1222
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:04,291
to tell her who I believed
the people were who robbed her house.

1223
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:07,967
I mean, when I get to tell
my side of this story...

1224
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,929
people are gonna know the truth.

1225
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,128
So, that's nerve-racking.

1226
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,646
She could think you robbed her house.

1227
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:18,122
Yeah. She could have.

1228
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,682
But, you know, anyway...

01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:25,526
