1
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:23,859
McCaleb.

2
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:27,361
Whatever happens,
it'll be his face on the front page.

3
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,419
What do you have?

4
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:48,886
I've had hemorrhoids for a while. You?

5
00:01:49,058 --> 00:01:52,789
Victims five and six.
Code Killer strikes again.

6
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,589
You're not a vegetarian, right?

7
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,565
How do you like your steak?
Big, red, juicy?

8
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:06,174
Neighbor came over to complain about
the noise. He got run over at the door.

9
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:09,906
Neighbor said he saw this
from the door.

10
00:02:10,112 --> 00:02:16,051
Bachelor number one hasn't been dating
lately. Apparently, he's a bed wetter.

11
00:02:16,252 --> 00:02:19,244
You're sick, you know that, Arrango?

12
00:02:20,022 --> 00:02:24,925
- Neighbor says he didn't see a thing.
- This might be important too.

13
00:02:25,127 --> 00:02:29,791
The maid quit about six years ago.
She didn't like the neighborhood.

14
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:38,433
We're calling him Chuck Taylor.

15
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:40,506
Oh, how's that?

16
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,576
Well, the prints. Look.

17
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,241
Converse. High-tops.

18
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:48,474
Chuck Taylor.

19
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:52,486
You get it, right?

20
00:02:53,856 --> 00:02:58,919
You don't know who Chuck Taylor is?
Basketball coach. Stanford Cardinals.

21
00:02:59,662 --> 00:03:02,563
We got the remains
of two or three people.

22
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,960
One of them could be a midget.

23
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:07,897
In any case, it's a hell of a gangbang.

24
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,505
Once you joke about it,
you shouldn't be doing it.

25
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,415
Another love note.

26
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:31,081
Maybe the two of you ought to get
a room someplace.

27
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,275
Was another message left for you?

28
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:50,503
Why is he singling you out?

29
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:52,180
I can't comment.

30
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:54,349
Are there numbers this time?

31
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:58,848
He loves it.

32
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:02,021
What does the message say?

33
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:04,249
Why does he focus on you?

34
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,861
- Do we have numbers this time?
- Were there numbers?

35
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:12,293
- Why does he single you out?
- What does he want?

36
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:14,562
Chuck.

37
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:15,999
You got a motive?

38
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:26,594
Clear.

39
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,495
Almost there.

40
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:34,635
Good. Coming out.

41
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:37,696
Good, Terry. You did good.

42
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:43,377
Are you taking your pills?

43
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:44,671
Yeah.

44
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,280
Yeah, all 34 of them.

45
00:07:47,783 --> 00:07:50,809
- No fever at all?
- No.

46
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,749
All clear of that.

47
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:55,856
- No diarrhea?
- No, nothing.

48
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,491
Good.

49
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,489
- Blood pressure and pulse?
- Right on target.

50
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:04,029
You're not working too hard
on the boat?

51
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:08,567
No, just enough to keep it afloat.
That's all.

52
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:10,671
I'll be back in a bit.

53
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,867
I'll check this blood work
and get the tissue to the lab.

54
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:17,210
Okay.

55
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:39,197
Don't start running laps yet,
but I'm very pleased.

56
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:42,929
No rejection.
All your blood levels are good.

57
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,632
- I might lower your prednisone next week.
- Thank God.

58
00:08:46,842 --> 00:08:49,470
I'm tired of shaving
three times a day.

59
00:08:49,678 --> 00:08:51,373
Lean forward.

60
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,182
- May I ask you something?
- No, don't talk.

61
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:00,720
Sit up.

62
00:09:02,524 --> 00:09:04,458
Okay, come around.

63
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:16,929
All right. What did you want to ask me?

64
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,699
The kid in 218...

65
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:21,432
...what's his blood type?

66
00:09:21,577 --> 00:09:25,343
It's different from yours,
if that's what you wanted to know.

67
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:30,177
- How long has he been waiting?
- About half as long as you did.

68
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,781
What are his chances?

69
00:09:34,023 --> 00:09:38,687
Maybe 50-50, maybe less.
What's bothering you, Terry?

70
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:40,117
I don't know.

71
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:46,329
When I was at the Bureau, we had
to qualify once a year on the range.

72
00:09:46,535 --> 00:09:49,629
You know, shoot at targets,
stuff like that.

73
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:55,705
We had a thing where you shoot
a circle around a heart.

74
00:09:55,878 --> 00:10:00,315
It was called the " 10 ring."
That was the highest score.

75
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:02,579
Typical.

76
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:05,682
You wait for a heart for two years...

77
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:10,985
...almost don't make it, then wonder
if we should've given you that heart.

78
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,024
Know what that is?

79
00:10:13,762 --> 00:10:14,820
B.S.?

80
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:19,566
Exactly. Go home and enjoy your boat.
See you next week.

81
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:24,002
How are you doing?

82
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:34,643
Morning, Terry.

83
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,752
Morning?
It's 2 in the afternoon, Buddy.

84
00:10:38,954 --> 00:10:43,288
As long as my dad sends those checks,
it's whatever time I say it is.

85
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:46,019
- Whatever.
- Heads up, by the way.

86
00:10:46,695 --> 00:10:49,027
Somebody's on your boat.

87
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:54,731
Been here 10 minutes. Looked harmless.
I didn't say anything.

88
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:58,539
Looks better than harmless!

89
00:11:04,313 --> 00:11:06,406
May I help you, miss?

90
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:09,377
I'm looking for Terry McCaleb.

91
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:13,719
You're looking at him.

92
00:11:13,922 --> 00:11:15,685
Graciella Rivers.

93
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:21,386
I have read about you in the paper,
in the "Where are they now?" column.

94
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,861
You know, in the Metro section.

95
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:27,594
You're not the first person
to try to find me.

96
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,729
I can recommend a good
investigator who won't rip you off.

97
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,741
The article said you're the best
and you hate when someone gets away.

98
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:41,746
If you read it, you know what happened
and that I'm retired, Miss Rivers.

99
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,110
Graciella.

100
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:44,576
Graciella.

101
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,951
I think you could help me.

102
00:11:47,122 --> 00:11:48,350
How's that?

103
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:52,218
- Maybe even help yourself.
- I don't need money.

104
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:55,022
I'm not talking about money.

105
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:03,760
Sister?

106
00:12:04,073 --> 00:12:06,507
- And her son.
- Which one?

107
00:12:07,109 --> 00:12:09,976
- Excuse me?
- Which one's dead?

108
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:12,479
My sister.

109
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:16,017
Gloria Torres. Glory.

110
00:12:16,418 --> 00:12:19,353
And her son's name is Raymond.

111
00:12:19,888 --> 00:12:24,348
- I don't think I can help you.
- Just look at it again, please.

112
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,287
Just one more time,
and I'll leave you alone.

113
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,864
Just tell me if you perceive
or feel anything.

114
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:36,397
Miss Rivers, I'm a retired FBI man,
not a psychic.

115
00:12:38,774 --> 00:12:42,210
- Do you want this back or not?
- I have a double.

116
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:45,039
You know, two for the price of one.

117
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:48,482
- You'll want to keep that one.
- Why is that?

118
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,821
Your heart, Mr. McCaleb.

119
00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:00,153
It was my sister's.

120
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:04,654
- How do you know that?
- Newspaper.

121
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,598
You two have the same blood type,
AB with CMV negative.

122
00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:11,432
You were operated on the day she died.

123
00:13:12,174 --> 00:13:16,110
My number's on the back
if you change your mind.

124
00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:55,542
Miss Rivers, this is Terry McCaleb.

125
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,982
Yeah, I'm sorry about it
being so late...

126
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:04,592
...but I wanted to tell you I'm going
to the police to see what's going on.

127
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:07,591
Don't thank me.
Don't get your hopes up.

128
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm just gonna have a look.
I owe your sister that much.

129
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:29,844
May I help you?

130
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:33,852
- Detective Arrango and Waller around?
- Your name?

131
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:37,918
McCaleb.
I'm here about the Gloria Torres case.

132
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:42,023
It's McCaleb.

133
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:50,101
Down the hall, up the stairs,
first door on your right.

134
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:51,897
Thanks.

135
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,372
Well, Mr. McCaleb.

136
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:01,743
Detective Arrango.

137
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:04,181
I thought you were dead
or retired.

138
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:07,550
I hear you want to talk
about Gloria Torres.

139
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:09,554
Can we talk privately?

140
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:10,714
About what?

141
00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:14,988
- I'm looking into her death.
- Here we go, same old shit.

142
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:20,196
I'll give you five minutes, that's it,
before I toss your ass right out.

143
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,635
- My partner will be here in a minute.
- Want a doughnut?

144
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:31,802
I want to know who you're working for.
Her sister, right?

145
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,174
That's right.

146
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:36,840
I knew it. Son of a bitch.
Let me see your ticket.

147
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:41,085
I don't have a license,
if that's what you mean.

148
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,484
Is it stuffy in here?

149
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:45,485
Is it hot?

150
00:15:45,661 --> 00:15:46,821
No.

151
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:48,824
Just get a little air.

152
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:56,134
Let me give us some air
and make it more comfortable.

153
00:15:56,305 --> 00:16:00,799
Okay, let me get this straight. You're
conducting a homicide investigation...

154
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:03,603
...into the Gloria Torres case?

155
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,007
That's true.

156
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:10,243
You don't have a license to practice
as a private investigator in California?

157
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:12,180
That's right.

158
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:17,557
Do you know it's a crime to practice
as an investigator without a license?

159
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,717
Will you knock off the crap?

160
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:23,453
I just wanted to have a talk.
Knock off the tape too.

161
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:27,591
- He's blocking the microphone anyway.
- Why didn't you say?

162
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:31,671
In the three years we've
interrogated here, maybe I forgot.

163
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,867
Come on, fellas. I'm just
here to help. Have a doughnut.

164
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,450
How do you know Graciella Rivers?

165
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:49,215
She's an acquaintance.
I told her I'd look into it. That's all.

166
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,796
If you guys aren't gonna have one,
I'm gonna have one.

167
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:18,877
Look.

168
00:17:19,554 --> 00:17:23,888
I don't care what her sister told you,
Mr. Former FBI Profiler.

169
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,550
This ain't the type of case you like.

170
00:17:26,728 --> 00:17:30,164
This ain't a glamorous case
that will get headlines.

171
00:17:30,665 --> 00:17:34,465
This isn't Charles Manson
or Ted fucking Bundy.

172
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,935
This is an ordinary
convenience-store robbery.

173
00:17:38,106 --> 00:17:39,767
Some idiot with a gun...

174
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:43,968
...with the right ratio
of balls to brains pulled the trigger.

175
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,410
I told her I'd check it out.

176
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:50,950
You've been on this a while,
and a fresh pair of eyes won't hurt.

177
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:55,556
I won't grandstand anybody.
I'll give any information to you first.

178
00:17:55,724 --> 00:17:58,249
I'm not trying to one-up anyone.

179
00:17:58,427 --> 00:17:59,587
What do you want?

180
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:03,727
A copy of the murder book
and a video walk-through of the scene.

181
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:06,367
I was always good with crime scenes.

182
00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:08,969
- No can do.
- Why not?

183
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:11,603
How often does the sister call you?

184
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:17,337
Every day, weekends, holidays...
Believe it or not, we got feelings.

185
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:21,141
It hurts me to tell her there
are no leads or suspects.

186
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:23,750
I can get her off your case.

187
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,619
I tell her I looked into it, you're
doing a good job, she stops calling.

188
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:33,284
You were always good at a crime scene.

189
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:36,192
But the key word is "were."
Are you still?

190
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:39,856
You just give me a copy
of the tape, that's all.

191
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,105
We got more than
just the crime-scene tape.

192
00:18:45,807 --> 00:18:48,002
We've got the crime.

193
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:50,804
Bring the doughnuts. Come on.

194
00:18:55,684 --> 00:18:58,175
That's Kyungwon Kang, the owner.

195
00:18:58,386 --> 00:19:03,323
He's about to make his last sale.
She comes in to buy a candy bar.

196
00:19:03,825 --> 00:19:05,690
Yeah, for her kid.

197
00:19:06,394 --> 00:19:11,229
And here he is. Ba-da-bing! Pow, pow.

198
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,926
He picked up all the shells.

199
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:20,199
Won't see this on
America's Favorite Videos.

200
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:25,335
- There's no sound on that camera?
- Right. He's just talking to himself.

201
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:29,908
- Could you run it in slow motion?
- Hold on. It's not over.

202
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:34,421
This guy coming up we call
the Good Samaritan. Watch.

203
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:39,860
This guy goes up and down the aisles,
looking for bandages, I guess.

204
00:19:40,495 --> 00:19:44,488
Couldn't find any, so he used paper
towels to wrap her head.

205
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,496
The camera never really
gets a good look at him.

206
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:52,868
After he's finished, he goes outside,
he dials 911...

207
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:55,008
...and splits.

208
00:19:55,176 --> 00:19:59,510
The voice was Latino. We figure
he was illegal, afraid to stay.

209
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:02,013
Yeah. That's too bad.

210
00:20:02,183 --> 00:20:06,176
He probably got a look
at the car or the shooter.

211
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:11,189
We put out fliers, went on all
the Spanish stations. Nothing.

212
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,920
- May I?
- Knock yourself out.

213
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:28,404
Pushing the pause button
ain't gonna help her.

214
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:35,749
$32 in the cash register.

215
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:38,078
Look at that. He winked.

216
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:40,111
What?

217
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,120
Yeah.

218
00:20:53,602 --> 00:20:56,093
Well, there you have it, Mr. FBI Guy.

219
00:20:56,504 --> 00:20:58,836
Tell us something we don't know.

220
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:01,803
The shooter's been
in the store before.

221
00:21:01,977 --> 00:21:04,639
He knew the placement
of the camera.

222
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:08,146
He's from the neighborhood,
or he just cased the place.

223
00:21:08,316 --> 00:21:11,285
This isn't the first time either.

224
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:14,820
No emotion, no panic,
policed up his own brass.

225
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,423
This guy's done it before.

226
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:25,556
What?

227
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:29,801
How many others?

228
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:33,171
Let me look at the murder book.

229
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:36,105
We have to talk to our lieutenant.
We'll be in touch.

230
00:21:36,277 --> 00:21:40,407
- When?
- Give me a number. We'll be in touch!

231
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:55,056
You guys can keep the doughnuts.

232
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:58,690
We don't need your doughnuts
or your shit!

233
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:00,528
We got enough of our own!

234
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:18,582
- Mrs. Kang?
- Yes? I know you?

235
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:19,879
No.

236
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:25,318
I heard what happened here.
Your husband and all. I'm sorry.

237
00:22:25,493 --> 00:22:27,825
Yes, thank you.

238
00:22:27,996 --> 00:22:31,523
The only way to keep evil out
is not unlock door.

239
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,998
We can't do that.

240
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:36,763
- We must have business.
- Yeah.

241
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:39,734
Thank you, ma'am.

242
00:23:01,362 --> 00:23:05,230
You gonna pay me, or should
I drive you somewhere else?

243
00:23:08,103 --> 00:23:10,799
Nearest public library.

244
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:06,989
Detective Winston said to wait here.
She'll be right with you.

245
00:24:28,483 --> 00:24:32,180
Well, well, well, Terry McCaleb.

246
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:38,018
- Hi.
- As I live and breathe.

247
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,422
Look at you.

248
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:46,793
Look at you.

249
00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:49,136
I hear you got a new ticker.

250
00:24:49,637 --> 00:24:53,801
That's right. I'm all right, though.

251
00:24:57,045 --> 00:24:59,445
How are you doing, babe?

252
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:02,846
Me? You know, same old, same old.

253
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:06,814
So, what's up?
You on a private ticket now?

254
00:25:06,988 --> 00:25:10,151
No. Just doing a favor for a friend.

255
00:25:10,325 --> 00:25:11,553
What case is it?

256
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:16,553
James Cordell. ATM holdup.

257
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:17,925
Let's see.

258
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:24,233
January 22. Newspaper says he was
shot by a guy wearing a ski mask.

259
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:27,902
Who's this friend you're
doing the favor for?

260
00:25:28,076 --> 00:25:33,480
Graciella Rivers. Her sister was
shot in a store two weeks after.

261
00:25:34,215 --> 00:25:36,513
Also a man in a ski mask.

262
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,382
Am I right? Are they connected?

263
00:25:39,888 --> 00:25:43,255
Yeah. Same guy.
Out of your orbit, though.

264
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:46,757
Scumbag with a gun.
Three-strikes shit, that's all.

265
00:25:46,928 --> 00:25:48,020
What do you mean?

266
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:52,360
Guy has two felonies,
third puts him away for life.

267
00:25:52,533 --> 00:25:55,263
So he kills any witnesses.

268
00:25:55,536 --> 00:26:00,166
Robbery, murder, it's all the same
sentence for him either way.

269
00:26:00,608 --> 00:26:04,635
I talked to the boys over at LAPD,
and they showed me a tape...

270
00:26:04,812 --> 00:26:08,213
...but they wouldn't copy
me the murder book.

271
00:26:10,418 --> 00:26:13,285
I'll bet they copied you, though.

272
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:18,789
Come on, darling,
you owe me just one little one.

273
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,621
I know that.

274
00:26:21,729 --> 00:26:24,357
When you handed me
the Cemetery Man bust...

275
00:26:24,565 --> 00:26:30,060
...you were my membership into
this boys club. I haven't forgotten.

276
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,030
Does that mean yes?

277
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:38,078
Terry McCaleb.

278
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:44,409
Lucky for us the bank
had two cameras on this.

279
00:26:44,585 --> 00:26:46,246
The shooter's back there.

280
00:26:46,421 --> 00:26:50,915
I'm betting the mask isn't on yet,
or Cordell would have run.

281
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:55,426
H&K 9mm, same model used
in the Valley tape.

282
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,293
Hold that.
Back it up a little bit.

283
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:04,059
Back up there.
Look, he's saying something.

284
00:27:04,238 --> 00:27:07,207
Like in the Valley tape.
He talked there too.

285
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,037
Yeah, he's a real chatterbox.

286
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:13,040
Did you get a lip reader in?

287
00:27:14,349 --> 00:27:16,317
I'll get on it.

288
00:27:16,484 --> 00:27:20,250
What about his cartridge?
Did he pick up his brass?

289
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:24,189
Yeah, there he is.

290
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,893
James Lockridge.

291
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:31,122
Pulled into the bank lot,
almost got sideswiped by a sedan.

292
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:34,200
Says it was a white guy,
but nothing else.

293
00:27:34,502 --> 00:27:38,836
He called for the ambulance.
Cordell died going to the hospital.

294
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:41,669
You got any leads at all?

295
00:27:41,843 --> 00:27:45,404
No, I'm following
the three-strike thing.

296
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,380
I think the man in the ski mask
is one of those.

297
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:54,788
What about the gun? H&K's
expensive for a holdup man.

298
00:27:54,956 --> 00:27:58,187
That's weird he'd keep
it after the first killing.

299
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:02,989
I thought about that. I figure he
stole it, but that lead me nowhere.

300
00:28:03,197 --> 00:28:08,965
I don't know. I think we'll need
fresh blood to solve this one.

301
00:28:10,104 --> 00:28:13,505
Well, Jaye...

302
00:28:13,674 --> 00:28:17,110
...why don't you get me
a copy of the book?

303
00:28:17,378 --> 00:28:19,369
Both yours and L.A. Could you?

304
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,412
I'll ask the captain.
I don't see why not.

305
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:25,780
He was the lieutenant
on the Cemetery Man case.

306
00:28:25,953 --> 00:28:28,979
Yeah, I kind of remember that.

307
00:28:29,157 --> 00:28:33,890
Oh, well. I'm glad
someone got promoted.

308
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:40,962
- Right here.
- Thanks.

309
00:28:42,503 --> 00:28:45,961
Mr. Lockridge, Terry McCaleb.
Thanks for seeing me.

310
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,471
Are you a policeman?

311
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:52,773
No, retired FBI. I'm investigating
a related case for a victim's family.

312
00:28:52,947 --> 00:28:55,916
- Good. Because police are stupid.
- Why?

313
00:28:57,752 --> 00:29:00,448
- Didn't they tell you?
- No.

314
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:05,217
Why would they? When I found
the guy, I call 911, right?

315
00:29:05,426 --> 00:29:06,484
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

316
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,789
They sent the ambulance
to the wrong place.

317
00:29:09,964 --> 00:29:11,727
Took them 20 minutes.

318
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:15,164
He might have made it
if they hadn't screwed up.

319
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,327
- Those things happen.
- No.

320
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,633
They screwed up. A guy died.
End of story.

321
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:25,641
I'm busy. I agreed to see you
because you're already here, so...

322
00:29:25,813 --> 00:29:27,110
...what do you want?

323
00:29:27,281 --> 00:29:30,648
I thought you'd give your
statement to me firsthand.

324
00:29:30,818 --> 00:29:32,979
For the love of God.
I needed cash.

325
00:29:33,154 --> 00:29:36,487
As I pulled up, the guy
driving out almost hits me.

326
00:29:36,657 --> 00:29:41,458
All I saw was a car.
There were no plates, no face, nothing.

327
00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:44,962
I walk up to the ATM,
and there's this guy bleeding.

328
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:49,263
I figured he got it right before
I got there, so I called 911.

329
00:29:49,437 --> 00:29:53,999
Ten minutes later, they come,
driving right fucking past us. Past us.

330
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:55,938
Any other details?

331
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:00,046
It could've been me.
Could've been him finding me...

332
00:30:00,214 --> 00:30:05,709
...with the ambulance driving
right on fucking by. Good stuff.

333
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,085
You done?

334
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,089
Yeah.

335
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:00,197
Hey, Buddy.

336
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:04,242
Here's to you. Semper fi,
auld lang syne, keep on trucking.

337
00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:07,040
You look like a skunk.

338
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:12,951
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Same as always. Big, fat goose egg.

339
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:17,387
I could use a driver.
$10 an hour and meals.

340
00:31:17,925 --> 00:31:22,362
- What's up? An investigation?
- I just need a driver, not a partner.

341
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:25,357
Okay. I'm in. Whose car?

342
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:29,629
If we take yours, I'll buy gas,
or I'll sit in the back in mine...

343
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,637
...because of the air bags.
- Your chest, right?

344
00:31:32,873 --> 00:31:33,965
Yeah.

345
00:31:34,141 --> 00:31:38,168
Let's take mine. That way
I won't feel like a chauffeur.

346
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,541
See you in the a.m.

347
00:31:42,216 --> 00:31:46,346
You look tired, Terry.
You should get some sleep!

348
00:32:11,545 --> 00:32:17,313
You don't deserve it.

349
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:57,619
First of all, I have no idea
where your heart came from.

350
00:32:57,958 --> 00:33:00,950
All BOPRA tells us is they
have an organ...

351
00:33:01,128 --> 00:33:03,790
...with a match to someone on the list.

352
00:33:03,964 --> 00:33:06,524
In your case, we told you
what we knew.

353
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:11,331
Female, 32, perfect health,
perfect blood typing, perfect donor.

354
00:33:11,505 --> 00:33:13,973
She was murdered.

355
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:15,904
Murdered?

356
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,908
What are you talking about?

357
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:22,741
She was shot during a robbery and lived
long enough for me to get her heart.

358
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:27,215
How do you know? You're not
supposed to know about the donor.

359
00:33:27,421 --> 00:33:29,013
Her sister found me.

360
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:33,684
She read about how I had a rare
blood type like her sister...

361
00:33:33,861 --> 00:33:36,921
...and that my surgery
was on the day she died.

362
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,623
What does she want? Money?

363
00:33:41,168 --> 00:33:43,398
I'm glad you can find it funny.

364
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,672
She wants me to find out who did it.

365
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:49,241
She wants me to solve the murder.

366
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:53,676
Shit. Give me this woman's
name right now.

367
00:33:56,617 --> 00:34:00,781
- You're not thinking of doing this?
- I started yesterday.

368
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:05,392
And today you're running a fever!
You are 60 days post-transplant!

369
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:08,528
As your doctor,
I'm ordering you not to do this.

370
00:34:08,696 --> 00:34:13,895
- Respect the gift you were given.
- I do, I do. It was her gift.

371
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:17,731
She'd be dead either way.
You don't owe her.

372
00:34:18,072 --> 00:34:20,438
It was supposed to be an accident.

373
00:34:20,608 --> 00:34:24,601
99 out of 100 of these are head
injuries that end up fatal.

374
00:34:24,779 --> 00:34:26,542
This one is different.

375
00:34:26,714 --> 00:34:29,239
How is it different?
A heart's a heart!

376
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:31,885
An accident is fate. Murder is evil.

377
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:33,143
Please.

378
00:34:34,755 --> 00:34:40,455
I wouldn't have this gift if somebody
hadn't done this hateful, evil thing.

379
00:34:40,928 --> 00:34:42,657
You're not making sense.

380
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,766
She goes into a store
to buy a candy bar for her kid.

381
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,499
I can't explain it.

382
00:34:50,104 --> 00:34:52,538
Terry, sit down.

383
00:35:00,581 --> 00:35:04,847
- You know that little boy in room 218?
- Yeah.

384
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:09,718
He's waiting for a heart that
isn't coming. That could be you.

385
00:35:09,957 --> 00:35:13,916
This is your one chance, Terry.
You tell that woman no.

386
00:35:14,295 --> 00:35:17,355
You save yourself and tell her no!

387
00:35:17,531 --> 00:35:18,828
I can't.

388
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:21,160
You're gambling with your life.

389
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:25,101
You get infection or rejection,
there's nothing we can do.

390
00:35:25,272 --> 00:35:27,672
- I have no choice.
- Neither do I.

391
00:35:27,842 --> 00:35:31,505
I can't be your doctor.
I won't be around for this.

392
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:33,203
Come on, doc.

393
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,372
I'll have your records ready
in the morning.

394
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,177
Good luck, Terry.

395
00:35:50,931 --> 00:35:54,867
Graciella. Make it quick.

396
00:35:58,405 --> 00:35:59,565
Hello?

397
00:36:00,307 --> 00:36:01,569
This is McCaleb.

398
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,972
What's going on?

399
00:36:04,178 --> 00:36:05,611
Tell me about her.

400
00:36:07,114 --> 00:36:08,308
What do you mean?

401
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,217
Just tell me something about Gloria.

402
00:36:11,552 --> 00:36:15,886
The more I know, the more
I can get a handle on this thing.

403
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:18,721
Do you have a kitchen on the boat?

404
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,490
A galley, yeah.

405
00:36:21,896 --> 00:36:24,490
Is it big enough to cook a real meal?

406
00:36:25,232 --> 00:36:27,291
Yeah, sort of.

407
00:36:27,868 --> 00:36:29,859
So...

408
00:36:30,037 --> 00:36:33,768
You want to know my sister,
you'll have to meet her son.

409
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:37,936
He's everything that was good
about her. It's in him.

410
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:41,445
I'll bring him by later,
and I'll make you dinner.

411
00:36:42,883 --> 00:36:44,248
Good. I'd like that.

412
00:36:44,585 --> 00:36:48,146
Okay. Then you can
give me an update.

413
00:36:49,757 --> 00:36:54,854
Look, just so you know it, these cases
usually turn on some small detail.

414
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:58,726
Something someone forgot
or didn't think was important.

415
00:36:58,899 --> 00:37:01,333
That's the key.
I'll have to find it.

416
00:37:01,735 --> 00:37:04,966
You have Glory's heart.
She'll guide you.

417
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,873
Yeah. Thanks.

418
00:37:16,183 --> 00:37:18,117
Quick enough?

419
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,984
- You okay?
- Yeah.

420
00:37:25,225 --> 00:37:26,920
- Huh?
- Dandy.

421
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:31,660
I'll tell you what. Let me stop by
the In-N-Out on Victory.

422
00:37:44,378 --> 00:37:47,814
I don't think they serve
hamburgers here. What's up?

423
00:37:47,982 --> 00:37:52,510
The sheriff's office listed all
the three-strikes robbery suspects.

424
00:37:52,686 --> 00:37:58,181
They also made a list of every H&K P7
pistol stolen in the last few years.

425
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,159
I charted that list
plus the address...

426
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:05,696
...and the work location
of every man on the list.

427
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,994
- A cross-reference to check overlap?
- Exactly.

428
00:38:09,169 --> 00:38:14,471
One guy stands out like a whore
in church, and that's Mikail Bolotov.

429
00:38:14,642 --> 00:38:19,375
He's a two-time loser, lives a mile
from where Gloria Torres was shot...

430
00:38:19,546 --> 00:38:23,539
...and works four blocks from where
an H&K was stolen in December.

431
00:38:23,717 --> 00:38:26,709
Why didn't they arrest
this Polo, Bolo...?

432
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,184
- Bolotov.
- Bolotov.

433
00:38:28,355 --> 00:38:31,483
Oh, a Russian son of a bitch!

434
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:36,189
They don't know about the pistol.
It seems he has a good alibi.

435
00:38:36,363 --> 00:38:40,766
It's his timecard. He punched
out after the Cordell murder.

436
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:44,597
- A friend could have done that.
- Yeah, true.

437
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:47,070
I still don't know why we're here.

438
00:38:47,775 --> 00:38:51,939
This is where he works.
I'm gonna go have a talk with him.

439
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:01,882
- Cool.
- Where are you going?

440
00:39:02,056 --> 00:39:05,685
You go after him, I pull you off.
Good cop, bad cop?

441
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:10,796
- No. Stay with the car.
- Come on, man. Starsky and Putz.

442
00:39:11,465 --> 00:39:13,626
What are you expecting in there?

443
00:39:13,801 --> 00:39:18,829
Nothing. This is just for show.
Hold this. Thanks.

444
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,350
Can I help you?

445
00:39:36,724 --> 00:39:39,158
My name is McCaleb.

446
00:39:40,394 --> 00:39:45,889
Following up the sheriff's department
investigation of February 3.

447
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:49,160
Just a minute, please.

448
00:39:50,571 --> 00:39:55,804
Mr. Toliver? A Mr. McCaleb from
the sheriff's department is here.

449
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:02,010
- We're awfully busy, Mr. McCaleb.
- I'll get right to the point, then.

450
00:40:02,182 --> 00:40:06,516
A few months ago, some deputies
asked you about an employee.

451
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,153
- Bolotov?
- Yes.

452
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:11,814
I'm on the case.
I'd like to get a few more points.

453
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,687
I'll tell you what I told them.

454
00:40:13,894 --> 00:40:18,194
Bolotov was working that day.
You can see his timecards.

455
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:22,427
How many employees
do you have here at one time?

456
00:40:22,603 --> 00:40:23,627
Eighty-five.

457
00:40:23,937 --> 00:40:28,670
Is it possible that one of them might
have punched his timecard for him?

458
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:32,672
We've been in business 16 years.
It's happened.

459
00:40:32,846 --> 00:40:34,211
Is he here today?

460
00:40:35,983 --> 00:40:39,475
Yes, that's him over there.

461
00:40:40,754 --> 00:40:42,847
Bolotov. That's Russian, right?

462
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,685
They're good workers
and don't complain.

463
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:48,157
They don't mind being paid shit.

464
00:40:48,328 --> 00:40:51,320
- I'd like to talk to him.
- In here?

465
00:40:51,498 --> 00:40:56,435
You want to maintain your cooperation
with the sheriff's office, don't you?

466
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:59,664
Yeah, all right.

467
00:41:08,816 --> 00:41:11,876
Bolotov, up in the office.

468
00:41:24,331 --> 00:41:27,823
Mr. Bolotov.
Have a chair.

469
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:37,943
Where were you on the night
of January 22?

470
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,975
I told them before.
I worked that night.

471
00:41:41,148 --> 00:41:44,777
I know, but we know things
now that we didn't know then.

472
00:41:45,052 --> 00:41:46,952
What things?

473
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:52,057
There was a burglary on Mason Street,
about four blocks from here.

474
00:41:52,226 --> 00:41:56,094
- Is that where you got the gun?
- What gun?

475
00:41:56,396 --> 00:42:00,594
And February 7, I suppose you
got an alibi for that night too.

476
00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:03,599
I don't know that night.

477
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,135
'Course you do!

478
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:10,242
That's the night you went into Kang's
grocery store and killed two people.

479
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:12,605
Who are you?

480
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:17,011
You're not a cop.
Cops goes twos. Who are you?

481
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:20,982
I'm the Lone Ranger. Now sit down.

482
00:42:32,799 --> 00:42:36,599
No badge. See? No cop.

483
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:41,206
"Terrell McCaleb."

484
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:44,276
Maybe one day, I pay you visit.

485
00:42:44,444 --> 00:42:45,604
Yes?

486
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:10,968
Not now. I'll get back to him.

487
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,436
Bolotov's alibi isn't solid.
Think about it.

488
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:18,303
Even if you had a badge,
it'd be the wrong one.

489
00:43:18,578 --> 00:43:20,045
I like him for this.

490
00:43:20,213 --> 00:43:24,479
Bolotov's an ex-con. He could have
done that for any reason.

491
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,119
You should still put out a pickup.

492
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:30,551
- Who the hell are you?
- Buddy, Terry's partner.

493
00:43:30,724 --> 00:43:31,884
- Sort of.
- Great.

494
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:34,289
Let's get back to Bolotov.

495
00:43:34,461 --> 00:43:37,828
I've already sent a car to his
apartment. He's gone.

496
00:43:37,998 --> 00:43:40,262
I hit a nerve.

497
00:43:40,434 --> 00:43:44,029
Remember my lieutenant, who's
now my captain? He's unhappy.

498
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,729
He doesn't want to hear
from you again.

499
00:43:46,907 --> 00:43:50,536
Terry has worked very hard on this.
We both have.

500
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,872
Shut up.

501
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,511
Also...

502
00:43:55,682 --> 00:44:01,518
...he wants the tapes and murder
books back first thing in the morning.

503
00:44:01,822 --> 00:44:05,223
Will that give you enough
time to copy everything?

504
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:08,088
I've already done that. Thanks.

505
00:44:08,261 --> 00:44:10,627
Go home, you look like crap.

506
00:44:10,797 --> 00:44:12,924
Wait a minute.

507
00:44:14,434 --> 00:44:19,701
Lip reader is 90% certain the shooter
was saying, "Happy Valentine's Day."

508
00:44:19,873 --> 00:44:21,568
Happy Valent...

509
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:26,145
That doesn't sound like your average
three-strikes guy, does it?

510
00:44:26,513 --> 00:44:29,880
What's the average these days?

511
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,883
Not much, man.

512
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:49,429
Happy Valentine's Day.

513
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,040
Do you see the boat?

514
00:44:58,211 --> 00:44:59,303
I told you.

515
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:04,012
- How much homework do you have?
- Three questions.

516
00:45:04,418 --> 00:45:06,079
- Hey.
- Hey.

517
00:45:07,054 --> 00:45:09,284
You forgot, didn't you?

518
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:13,085
Sort of. I kind of got lost
the last couple hours.

519
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,490
We can do this another time.

520
00:45:15,662 --> 00:45:18,358
No, we're having dinner.
Come on up.

521
00:45:18,765 --> 00:45:21,256
- Is this Raymond?
- This is Raymond.

522
00:45:21,435 --> 00:45:23,995
This is the man I was
telling you about.

523
00:45:24,171 --> 00:45:27,800
- How are you doing?
- What's The Following Sea?

524
00:45:27,974 --> 00:45:32,434
That's the one that you have to
watch for, the one right behind you.

525
00:45:32,913 --> 00:45:37,646
- Where's the kitchen? I mean, galley?
- Right in here.

526
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:40,844
- Can you fish off this boat?
- Yeah, you can.

527
00:45:41,021 --> 00:45:44,286
Come on back,
I'll get you a fishing pole.

528
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,667
Jesus.

529
00:45:59,773 --> 00:46:02,503
I didn't want you to see that.

530
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,638
Was she...?

531
00:46:07,447 --> 00:46:08,914
Was she ever scared?

532
00:46:09,616 --> 00:46:13,211
No, she never knew anything.

533
00:46:16,723 --> 00:46:19,920
What I've asked you to do,
it just isn't fair.

534
00:46:20,494 --> 00:46:22,485
Is it?

535
00:46:22,929 --> 00:46:27,662
There's a restaurant in the marina.
Good atmosphere, view of the sunset.

536
00:46:27,834 --> 00:46:30,962
Why don't I just take you
to dinner there.

537
00:46:37,144 --> 00:46:39,169
Why do you live on a boat?

538
00:46:39,346 --> 00:46:42,042
I hate mowing lawns.

539
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:44,180
Why do you live onshore?

540
00:46:44,351 --> 00:46:47,878
Because that's where my warm,
cozy apartment is.

541
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,046
You were right, though.

542
00:46:51,691 --> 00:46:53,522
It's a great sunset.

543
00:46:54,227 --> 00:46:59,290
Yeah, you never get tired of it.
Does he stay with you?

544
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:04,534
Yeah. His dad isn't around.

545
00:47:04,704 --> 00:47:09,073
He's a great kid. Your sister
must have been a good woman.

546
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:11,634
Thank you.

547
00:47:12,512 --> 00:47:15,379
So how is it going, McCaleb?

548
00:47:15,849 --> 00:47:18,010
Any hope?

549
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:21,114
Start thinking about your sister...

550
00:47:21,288 --> 00:47:25,418
...who her friends were,
where she went, all of her routines.

551
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:29,961
- All right. How come?
- That's just an angle I'm working on.

552
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:32,564
Did she ever know a James Cordell?

553
00:47:32,732 --> 00:47:35,530
- Cordell?
- Yeah.

554
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:36,958
No.

555
00:47:37,137 --> 00:47:39,571
- You sure?
- Positive. Why?

556
00:47:39,739 --> 00:47:42,708
It may be nothing.
It might be premature...

557
00:47:42,876 --> 00:47:45,777
You think this James Cordell
killed her.

558
00:47:45,979 --> 00:47:47,640
No, nothing like that.

559
00:47:47,814 --> 00:47:52,217
Stop, McCaleb, with the prematures
and the angles. What?

560
00:47:52,385 --> 00:47:57,550
Cordell was killed at an ATM machine
two weeks before your sister died.

561
00:47:57,724 --> 00:48:00,989
We think it's the same gunman
in both cases.

562
00:48:01,161 --> 00:48:02,924
Why would she know Cordell?

563
00:48:03,096 --> 00:48:06,429
They were both in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

564
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,263
This investigation's being conducted
under the theory...

565
00:48:10,437 --> 00:48:14,533
...that the locations were chosen
and the victims were random.

566
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:20,010
It's the other way around. It's not
where that's important. It's who.

567
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:24,139
- Gunman took money, so it's robbery...
- Bear with me.

568
00:48:24,317 --> 00:48:27,309
Cordell and your sister
were connected.

569
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:31,617
There's some intersecting link
between them and the killer.

570
00:48:32,259 --> 00:48:34,022
I'm not following you.

571
00:48:34,361 --> 00:48:39,162
At the Bureau, we used to call
this a full-field investigation.

572
00:48:39,332 --> 00:48:44,133
- That's what I'm conducting here.
- Full-field investigation.

573
00:48:45,105 --> 00:48:46,231
Okay.

574
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,337
Come on!

575
00:48:54,948 --> 00:48:58,816
You know, there was one thing
that's always bothered me.

576
00:48:58,985 --> 00:49:00,714
- What?
- Nothing, but...

577
00:49:00,887 --> 00:49:02,013
What is it?

578
00:49:02,188 --> 00:49:06,955
Glory had this piece of jewelry she
always wore. Like a good-luck charm.

579
00:49:07,127 --> 00:49:12,724
She never took it off. When the police
brought me her effects, it was missing.

580
00:49:12,899 --> 00:49:13,888
What was it?

581
00:49:14,067 --> 00:49:18,436
It was a single earring,
a dangling crucifix.

582
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,576
Okay. So, what does it mean?

583
00:49:26,479 --> 00:49:31,348
Nothing. Some killers take
souvenirs, I suppose.

584
00:49:33,086 --> 00:49:34,610
- That's sick.
- Yeah.

585
00:49:34,788 --> 00:49:35,777
Are you okay?

586
00:49:35,955 --> 00:49:39,550
Yeah. I gotta get back to the boat
for my medicine.

587
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:43,321
We have to get going too.
Raymond has some homework.

588
00:49:43,496 --> 00:49:44,520
Raymond?

589
00:49:44,698 --> 00:49:47,030
We've gotta go!

590
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,691
Say thank you to Mr. McCaleb. Come!

591
00:49:49,869 --> 00:49:52,133
Thank you!

592
00:49:56,242 --> 00:49:58,506
- Give me that schoolbag.
- Okay.

593
00:49:58,678 --> 00:50:00,509
- Say thank you.
- Thank you.

594
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,911
- See you later.
- Give me the school bag.

595
00:50:09,522 --> 00:50:11,820
And he takes the earring.

596
00:50:13,526 --> 00:50:15,824
Hey, Buddy!

597
00:50:18,631 --> 00:50:20,155
What's up?

598
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,892
You're working tomorrow, 6 a.m.

599
00:50:24,137 --> 00:50:26,128
Cool. Whatever.

600
00:50:31,478 --> 00:50:34,675
Who wants to go to the desert anyhow?

601
00:50:35,281 --> 00:50:37,112
We go where the clues lead.

602
00:50:37,484 --> 00:50:40,385
Don't any clues lead to the beach?

603
00:50:40,553 --> 00:50:45,923
They lead where they lead. Usually
pretty close to where they started.

604
00:50:49,162 --> 00:50:51,892
I have to ask, Terry.

605
00:50:52,465 --> 00:50:53,932
How did it feel?

606
00:50:54,334 --> 00:50:58,634
Back in the day, when you were
going up against all those sickos?

607
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,329
That was my job.

608
00:51:00,507 --> 00:51:04,273
Come on, man. I mean,
driving a truck, that's a job.

609
00:51:04,444 --> 00:51:07,174
All those killers
you used to hunt down.

610
00:51:07,347 --> 00:51:12,842
I read in the paper some used to leave
you messages. That ain't truck driving.

611
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:17,422
Only one, actually,
ever left me messages.

612
00:51:19,192 --> 00:51:22,593
Sorry, I'm sticking my nose
in it, I know.

613
00:51:22,762 --> 00:51:24,195
Connected.

614
00:51:24,764 --> 00:51:26,595
What?

615
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,703
When I was at the top of my game,
I felt connected to everything.

616
00:51:31,971 --> 00:51:35,498
The victim, the killer,
the crime scene.

617
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,438
Everything.

618
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:43,708
Just felt like it was all part of me.
It's beginning to feel that way again.

619
00:51:44,217 --> 00:51:46,242
Cool.

620
00:51:48,288 --> 00:51:54,284
I'll tell you what. Driving is okay
because I would shit my shorts.

621
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,860
I would.

622
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:03,435
But that's why you're a famous cop
and I'm a boat bum. A loser.

623
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:06,001
Buddy, you're not a loser.

624
00:52:06,172 --> 00:52:11,701
It's okay, Terry.
Only my mom has to tell me that.

625
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:14,813
My friends can tell me the truth.

626
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:31,556
Mrs. Cordell?

627
00:52:32,432 --> 00:52:34,764
I'm Terry McCaleb. I called you.

628
00:52:35,034 --> 00:52:37,002
Is this a bad time?

629
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:42,072
- As opposed to a good time?
- Poor choice of words. Can we talk?

630
00:52:42,709 --> 00:52:44,939
Is that your partner in the car?

631
00:52:47,514 --> 00:52:49,345
Yeah.

632
00:52:49,782 --> 00:52:53,741
I wanted to hire an investigator,
but I couldn't afford to.

633
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,718
Couldn't afford to find out
who killed him.

634
00:52:57,123 --> 00:52:58,715
You work for the police?

635
00:52:58,892 --> 00:53:01,019
No, I'm a retired FBI agent.

636
00:53:01,194 --> 00:53:05,654
I'm also a friend of the family
of the woman killed in Canoga Park.

637
00:53:05,832 --> 00:53:08,130
We think it's the same gunman.

638
00:53:08,301 --> 00:53:09,632
I see.

639
00:53:10,203 --> 00:53:15,038
I'd like to tell you I'm sorry.
That's hard coming from a stranger...

640
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:19,474
...but I went through the files, and
James seemed like a good man.

641
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:23,712
Funny hearing him called James.
Everyone called him Jimmy.

642
00:53:23,883 --> 00:53:26,408
And he was a very good man.

643
00:53:26,586 --> 00:53:29,419
How can I help, Mr. McCaleb?

644
00:53:30,323 --> 00:53:34,089
See this photograph?
Does this woman look familiar to you?

645
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:37,889
- Is that someone he might have known?
- I don't think so.

646
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:42,431
- Is that the victim from Canoga Park?
- Right.

647
00:53:42,602 --> 00:53:44,900
Is that her son?

648
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:47,438
I don't understand.

649
00:53:47,607 --> 00:53:50,633
How could he know her?
Are you suggesting they...?

650
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:53,802
- No, nothing like that.
- Then, like what?

651
00:53:54,414 --> 00:54:00,011
We think your husband and Miss Torres
may have crossed paths with the killer...

652
00:54:00,186 --> 00:54:05,681
...sort of the relationship between
the victim and the gunman.

653
00:54:05,858 --> 00:54:11,626
The smallest detail of them coming
in contact is very, very important.

654
00:54:11,798 --> 00:54:15,700
Something like dining at the same
restaurant, for instance.

655
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:18,800
- A restaurant the killer went to?
- Yeah.

656
00:54:18,972 --> 00:54:21,998
That sounds like stalking,
not robbery.

657
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:27,875
To be honest with you, we're not sure
robbery is the motive in this case.

658
00:54:28,581 --> 00:54:32,574
When they brought back his effects,
was it all there?

659
00:54:32,752 --> 00:54:35,653
Was anything missing?
Rings, watches?

660
00:54:35,822 --> 00:54:37,653
No.

661
00:54:38,057 --> 00:54:42,585
You're sure he couldn't have been
in the Valley two weeks before?

662
00:54:42,762 --> 00:54:47,256
No, he spent a month in Northern
California, working on the aqueduct.

663
00:54:47,433 --> 00:54:51,995
And when my husband wasn't
working, he was home with me.

664
00:54:52,171 --> 00:54:55,470
- Is that his car?
- Yes.

665
00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:58,840
Any personal effects in that?

666
00:54:59,012 --> 00:55:01,071
A picture on the dashboard.

667
00:55:01,247 --> 00:55:04,239
- Still there?
- I don't know. I would think.

668
00:55:04,417 --> 00:55:08,717
The sheriff's department drove
it home. I haven't been in it.

669
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,152
Can I...?

670
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:20,789
There it is.

671
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:22,798
Right here, yeah.

672
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:26,871
Any of this stuff your husband's
favorite knickknacks?

673
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,029
No, sorry.

674
00:55:29,976 --> 00:55:34,003
Could you jot down your
husband's routines for me...?

675
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,943
- His sunglasses.
- What?

676
00:55:36,115 --> 00:55:40,552
They hung from the mirror on a cord.
They're missing.

677
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,085
What kind of glasses?

678
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:45,713
They were Wayfarers.
He had them for years.

679
00:55:45,892 --> 00:55:49,350
- Wayfarers?
- What do you think it means?

680
00:55:50,029 --> 00:55:52,964
I said, what do you think it means?

681
00:55:53,633 --> 00:55:55,225
Probably nothing.

682
00:55:55,401 --> 00:55:59,633
Thanks, Mrs. Cordell.
I'll call you if anything comes up.

683
00:56:05,311 --> 00:56:08,644
Easy, Mac. What's the matter?

684
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:14,246
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

685
00:56:15,788 --> 00:56:18,256
I saw the killer, Buddy.

686
00:56:19,092 --> 00:56:22,926
At the bank, at the ATM,
where Cordell was killed.

687
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:28,292
Wait a minute, that's crazy.
That's the last place he would be.

688
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,766
No, it fits the profile.

689
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:33,664
Profile? What profile?

690
00:56:33,906 --> 00:56:37,672
Take me to the L.A. County
Sheriff's Office.

691
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:43,377
No, wait! I don't get it.
Why would the killer go back?

692
00:56:45,818 --> 00:56:48,844
Okay. Never mind, I'll just drive.

693
00:56:52,592 --> 00:56:57,586
- Now you're starting to get it.
- This goes any longer, I want a raise.

694
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:00,761
How about workmen's comp?

695
00:57:01,634 --> 00:57:05,331
Detective Winston's in the field.
Can I take a message?

696
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,633
- Tell her McCaleb was by.
- Hey.

697
00:57:08,808 --> 00:57:12,574
She wanted to see you, Mr. McCaleb.

698
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,345
How about that?

699
00:57:15,982 --> 00:57:18,644
It's McCaleb, Jaye.

700
00:57:18,818 --> 00:57:22,845
I'm en route. You should get
yourself down here ASAP.

701
00:57:23,222 --> 00:57:25,156
What was that first part?

702
00:57:25,324 --> 00:57:28,760
I said, we've got Bolotov.

703
00:57:46,746 --> 00:57:49,237
- Stay there, Buddy.
- This sucks!

704
00:57:49,415 --> 00:57:53,818
Trash collectors found him.
We think he's been here since early a.m.

705
00:57:53,986 --> 00:57:57,285
- What are they doing here?
- This alley is the line.

706
00:57:57,456 --> 00:57:58,480
The line?

707
00:57:58,658 --> 00:58:01,889
South side's LAPD,
north is sheriff's department.

708
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:04,928
We're not sure who
has jurisdiction yet.

709
00:58:10,436 --> 00:58:12,404
Congratulations, old man!

710
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:16,668
You shook him out of his tree.
Dumb bastard killed himself.

711
00:58:16,843 --> 00:58:18,333
H&K 9mm.

712
00:58:18,511 --> 00:58:22,106
Same as both murders.
I bet ballistics confirms it.

713
00:58:24,851 --> 00:58:29,515
- What are you talking about?
- He's saying this case is closed.

714
00:58:29,722 --> 00:58:32,122
Bolotov, he doesn't fit the profile.

715
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,691
- Of what?
- A serial killer.

716
00:58:35,928 --> 00:58:39,557
This guy stalks his victims
and kills them on camera...

717
00:58:39,732 --> 00:58:44,169
...then he takes trophy items.
- What are you talking about?

718
00:58:44,337 --> 00:58:48,068
I was at the ATM crime scene.
The killer was behind me.

719
00:58:48,241 --> 00:58:52,541
He had Cordell's glasses on,
and he had Gloria Torres' earring.

720
00:58:52,712 --> 00:58:55,875
Did they look like these?

721
00:58:56,048 --> 00:58:59,279
This? And this?

722
00:58:59,886 --> 00:59:04,220
I don't care what you call him.
We got him.

723
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:10,789
- I don't know, his hair was long.
- Maybe it was a wig?

724
00:59:10,963 --> 00:59:12,760
Maybe.

725
00:59:12,932 --> 00:59:15,992
- You wanna sit down?
- I'm fine, goddamn it.

726
00:59:16,168 --> 00:59:20,298
- Why don't you lay down?
- Arrango, shut up!

727
00:59:24,343 --> 00:59:27,676
There's something in his mouth.

728
00:59:30,516 --> 00:59:34,680
- It's a bullet.
- No way it came from a 9mm.

729
00:59:36,122 --> 00:59:40,320
- Looks like a.38 to me.
- Why'd he put a.38 slug in his mouth?

730
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:43,462
Same reason he died
on the jurisdiction line.

731
00:59:43,629 --> 00:59:46,120
Somebody's trying to jerk us all off.

732
00:59:46,299 --> 00:59:49,132
Personally, I like being jerked off.

733
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:51,496
This case is closed in my book.

734
00:59:51,704 --> 00:59:54,639
You're just worried, aren't you?

735
00:59:54,807 --> 00:59:56,672
- Worried?
- Yeah.

736
00:59:56,842 --> 00:59:57,934
About what?

737
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:02,774
That I might bust this case.
You don't care who gets hurt or killed.

738
01:00:02,949 --> 01:00:08,148
- As long as I don't bust the case.
- What the fuck is it to you anyway?

739
01:00:08,321 --> 01:00:12,087
Gloria Torres, that victim
you didn't give a shit about?

740
01:00:12,258 --> 01:00:15,056
I've got her heart. That's what.
That's right.

741
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:19,263
I'm alive because she's dead.
That puts me in this bigtime.

742
01:00:19,432 --> 01:00:24,369
You're an asshole, and you can't help
it, but I'm on this case for a while.

743
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,835
I'll be along until we get him.

744
01:00:27,006 --> 01:00:31,773
I don't care whether it's you, him
or whoever. I'm in this.

745
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:35,806
Stay out of my city!
Go get yourself a dick transplant!

746
01:00:35,982 --> 01:00:39,179
Conflict of interest.

747
01:00:39,352 --> 01:00:42,549
- Ever think about that?
- Pain in the ass.

748
01:00:43,956 --> 01:00:48,120
- How much do I owe you?
- I don't know, 200 or so.

749
01:00:48,294 --> 01:00:50,524
That sounds right.

750
01:00:52,999 --> 01:00:56,491
- Take a check?
- Yeah, sure.

751
01:00:56,669 --> 01:00:59,502
You look like shit.
You should take a nap.

752
01:00:59,672 --> 01:01:02,732
Yeah, thanks. I will.

753
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:09,006
- Who do I make it out to? Buddy?
- Jasper. Jasper Noone. N-O-O-N-E.

754
01:01:09,181 --> 01:01:12,412
I know the Noone part. But Jasper?

755
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:15,247
I look more like a Buddy
than a Jasper, huh?

756
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:17,321
Yeah.

757
01:01:18,457 --> 01:01:20,789
Take a nap.

758
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:36,674
Ray, stay out here. Be careful
of the edges. I'll be right out.

759
01:01:36,879 --> 01:01:40,280
- Hi.
- Hey.

760
01:01:41,817 --> 01:01:44,877
So is it true?

761
01:01:45,321 --> 01:01:46,379
What?

762
01:01:46,956 --> 01:01:51,256
I heard it on the news. They said
that they found a Russian man...

763
01:01:51,427 --> 01:01:53,224
...who may be the killer.

764
01:01:53,395 --> 01:01:54,760
I don't know.

765
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:58,627
I don't think so, but I don't know.

766
01:01:58,801 --> 01:02:03,329
They said they had evidence that
could link this guy to both murders.

767
01:02:03,906 --> 01:02:07,307
That may just be two cops
trying to grab headlines.

768
01:02:07,476 --> 01:02:09,307
I don't know. Sorry.

769
01:02:09,478 --> 01:02:12,174
You're starting to sound like L.A.P.D.

770
01:02:12,848 --> 01:02:15,146
I need some answers.

771
01:02:15,317 --> 01:02:17,012
Because no one knows...

772
01:02:17,186 --> 01:02:22,920
No one has a clue what that boy goes
through every night without his mother.

773
01:02:23,092 --> 01:02:25,322
I'm sorry.

774
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,826
I did what you asked.

775
01:02:36,305 --> 01:02:39,172
I made a list of all
of Glory's routines.

776
01:02:39,341 --> 01:02:41,138
That's good.

777
01:02:43,913 --> 01:02:47,440
She used to go to that market
almost every night.

778
01:02:47,616 --> 01:02:50,813
She'd take Raymond
to McDonald's a lot. Too much.

779
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:54,485
The one on Ventura and Reseda.

780
01:02:55,891 --> 01:02:59,691
And she would go bowling,
but not lately.

781
01:02:59,862 --> 01:03:02,592
She used to visit an aunt
every Thursday...

782
01:03:03,032 --> 01:03:07,025
...because our aunt was in a
nursing home in Culver City.

783
01:03:07,202 --> 01:03:11,036
Like a responsible person,
she never missed a day of work.

784
01:03:11,206 --> 01:03:14,733
She gave blood every month,
took her son to school...

785
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:17,811
...and I wanna understand
why she was killed!

786
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:19,004
What?

787
01:03:20,115 --> 01:03:21,673
She gave blood?

788
01:03:21,917 --> 01:03:26,149
Yes, McCaleb. She's the same
blood type as you are.

789
01:03:26,322 --> 01:03:28,381
AB with a CMV negative.

790
01:03:28,557 --> 01:03:32,721
The hospital would have paid her,
but she wouldn't accept money.

791
01:03:32,995 --> 01:03:36,487
- That's the connection!
- What are you talking about?

792
01:03:36,665 --> 01:03:40,396
That's the link between Cordell
and your sister. Blood.

793
01:03:40,903 --> 01:03:43,394
Wait a minute. Blood?

794
01:03:50,713 --> 01:03:53,181
I'll cover tomorrow's shift.

795
01:03:53,349 --> 01:03:55,943
Yeah, thanks.

796
01:03:57,052 --> 01:04:00,783
- Don't you ever use a cell phone?
- I don't believe in them.

797
01:04:00,956 --> 01:04:04,687
I always stay with a hard line.
Mrs. Cordell wasn't home.

798
01:04:05,127 --> 01:04:07,391
Is there another way to find out?

799
01:04:07,563 --> 01:04:10,555
If he gave blood often,
he'd be on the computer.

800
01:04:10,733 --> 01:04:13,167
- Which computer?
- The BOPRA computer.

801
01:04:13,335 --> 01:04:16,771
For rare blood types.
There's one at L.A. Memorial.

802
01:04:16,939 --> 01:04:21,774
- All right. I'm coming with you.
- Get somebody to stay with the kid.

803
01:04:22,544 --> 01:04:24,569
What do you think?

804
01:04:24,747 --> 01:04:27,443
What do you mean, babysitting?

805
01:04:27,616 --> 01:04:28,810
- Yeah.
- Fuck me.

806
01:04:28,984 --> 01:04:30,076
How much?

807
01:04:30,252 --> 01:04:33,983
I don't know. Beer.
A case of beer an hour.

808
01:04:34,156 --> 01:04:36,283
You got it.

809
01:04:52,341 --> 01:04:54,571
Hey, doc.

810
01:04:54,743 --> 01:04:56,802
Terry. What's wrong?

811
01:04:56,979 --> 01:05:00,346
Nothing. Is there a place
we could talk privately?

812
01:05:00,516 --> 01:05:02,484
I need to talk to you.

813
01:05:08,157 --> 01:05:10,887
You have five minutes.

814
01:05:12,428 --> 01:05:13,520
Who's this?

815
01:05:13,695 --> 01:05:16,528
Graciella Rivers,
the one I told you about.

816
01:05:16,698 --> 01:05:21,635
She's the one who put you up to this.
Look at him. Look at his color.

817
01:05:21,804 --> 01:05:26,036
Look at the lines under his eyes.
A week ago, he was perfect.

818
01:05:26,208 --> 01:05:28,267
- I am sorry.
- It was my choice.

819
01:05:28,444 --> 01:05:31,504
Shut up! Sit down.

820
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,841
Open your mouth.

821
01:05:35,851 --> 01:05:38,251
Lift your shirt up.

822
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:51,165
- What do you want?
- We wanted to know...

823
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:56,202
- Keep that thermometer in your mouth.
- My sister was murdered.

824
01:05:56,371 --> 01:05:58,168
So was another man.

825
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,831
It was the same killer.

826
01:06:01,009 --> 01:06:04,775
McCaleb found a link between
my sister and this other man.

827
01:06:04,947 --> 01:06:07,711
- They both gave blood.
- What?

828
01:06:07,883 --> 01:06:12,047
She was the same blood type
as McCaleb, AB with CMV negative.

829
01:06:12,221 --> 01:06:15,622
McCaleb says that's 1 in 200.

830
01:06:19,261 --> 01:06:22,788
101.1. Shit.

831
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:26,028
What do you want?

832
01:06:26,201 --> 01:06:28,863
I want you to access
the BOPRA computer.

833
01:06:29,037 --> 01:06:32,302
If Cordell's on it,
I wanna know his blood type.

834
01:06:32,474 --> 01:06:33,668
That's unethical.

835
01:06:33,842 --> 01:06:38,404
You've gotta help. If I'm right,
the killer already has access.

836
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:40,077
I don't know...

837
01:06:40,249 --> 01:06:44,686
If you can't protect the integrity
of the system, there's no system.

838
01:06:45,053 --> 01:06:46,145
All right.

839
01:06:46,355 --> 01:06:48,448
I'll do it on one condition.

840
01:06:48,724 --> 01:06:49,850
What's that?

841
01:06:50,025 --> 01:06:52,118
Let me run blood work on you.

842
01:06:52,294 --> 01:06:56,253
- That will take all day!
- Yes or no?

843
01:06:57,266 --> 01:07:00,201
- Yes.
- Sit down.

844
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:03,768
I'll get the nurse.

845
01:07:08,277 --> 01:07:09,801
Very still now.

846
01:07:10,078 --> 01:07:12,444
We're almost done.

847
01:07:20,822 --> 01:07:23,882
I want you to stop, McCaleb.

848
01:07:26,862 --> 01:07:28,796
Stop what?

849
01:07:29,932 --> 01:07:31,957
Everything.

850
01:07:32,134 --> 01:07:34,500
I was wrong to bring this to you.

851
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:35,932
No.

852
01:07:36,104 --> 01:07:37,935
Yeah.

853
01:07:39,141 --> 01:07:41,371
Glory gave another person life.

854
01:07:41,543 --> 01:07:45,343
- That's really all I need to know.
- No.

855
01:07:45,514 --> 01:07:47,982
Look, I got a new heart, but...

856
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:51,779
...I didn't necessarily
get a new life.

857
01:07:51,954 --> 01:07:54,684
I don't know what you mean.

858
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:57,515
I lost a little something...

859
01:07:57,693 --> 01:08:00,924
...but knowing you and
working with you on this...

860
01:08:01,096 --> 01:08:04,156
...I feel a little bit coming back.

861
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:09,928
Okay.

862
01:08:10,105 --> 01:08:14,166
It's a list of the local AB CMV
negatives. Cordell's on it.

863
01:08:14,343 --> 01:08:16,470
Same blood type as Torres.

864
01:08:16,645 --> 01:08:18,977
What's the D stand for? Deceased?

865
01:08:19,147 --> 01:08:22,583
No, donor. Organ donor.
They were both organ donors.

866
01:08:23,018 --> 01:08:24,849
Both organ donors?

867
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:28,922
Cordell died on the scene,
and Gloria lived just long enough.

868
01:08:29,091 --> 01:08:31,616
- That's crazy.
- What are you saying?

869
01:08:31,893 --> 01:08:33,292
I missed it, damn it.

870
01:08:33,462 --> 01:08:37,956
I didn't think Gloria had anything
anyone wanted, but I missed it.

871
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:40,460
What did you miss?

872
01:08:40,636 --> 01:08:42,934
Her blood.

873
01:08:43,171 --> 01:08:45,230
It made her unique.

874
01:08:45,407 --> 01:08:49,104
It made what was inside her
very valuable. To someone.

875
01:08:49,278 --> 01:08:55,217
Someone like me. Anyone who could
benefit would be a suspect.

876
01:08:56,485 --> 01:09:01,013
Wait a minute. You're saying that
she was murdered for her organs.

877
01:09:01,423 --> 01:09:05,917
The autopsy report had both
bullets going through the frontal lobe.

878
01:09:06,094 --> 01:09:09,860
That could leave them brain dead,
but not die right away.

879
01:09:10,032 --> 01:09:16,096
Of course, Cordell... 911 screwed up,
but your sister had the Good Samaritan.

880
01:09:16,271 --> 01:09:18,171
Who?

881
01:09:19,941 --> 01:09:24,901
That's the customer who came in,
bandaged her head and called 911.

882
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:28,811
- You can't get back until...
- Can I use your phone?

883
01:09:29,451 --> 01:09:34,388
Get a list of where all
the organs went, will you?

884
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,892
Detective Jaye Winston?

885
01:09:47,069 --> 01:09:51,699
Graciella Rivers. He's inside talking
about surveillance and numbers.

886
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,870
This is Arrango from
West Valley Homicide.

887
01:09:55,043 --> 01:10:00,276
Badge 141 10. I'd like a 10-20
for a surveillance commencement.

888
01:10:00,449 --> 01:10:02,610
That's 17:14:39.

889
01:10:02,784 --> 01:10:04,877
Thank you. 17:14:39.

890
01:10:05,053 --> 01:10:08,921
I'm out of my jurisdiction,
and you're way out. What's up?

891
01:10:09,157 --> 01:10:13,355
The surveillance camera's three
seconds behind the CCW clock.

892
01:10:13,528 --> 01:10:17,555
- That's the one 911 uses.
- Okay, so?

893
01:10:17,733 --> 01:10:20,531
So did you bring the tape?

894
01:10:23,839 --> 01:10:25,898
This is the 911 operator.

895
01:10:26,074 --> 01:10:29,134
The girl is shot very bad!
She needs help!

896
01:10:29,311 --> 01:10:30,778
Who was shot, sir?

897
01:10:30,946 --> 01:10:34,074
The girl is shot!
Kang's Market, Sherman Way!

898
01:10:34,249 --> 01:10:37,150
Sir, please stay on the line.

899
01:10:43,258 --> 01:10:46,591
That's 10:40:58.

900
01:11:02,944 --> 01:11:05,845
All right. At 22:41:37...

901
01:11:06,014 --> 01:11:10,041
...Gloria is shot.

902
01:11:11,353 --> 01:11:13,685
Jump down to...

903
01:11:13,855 --> 01:11:18,952
...22:42:55, and here comes
Good Samaritan.

904
01:11:19,127 --> 01:11:21,891
That son of a bitch.

905
01:11:22,063 --> 01:11:25,294
What? What is it?

906
01:11:25,467 --> 01:11:27,230
This guy here...

907
01:11:27,402 --> 01:11:31,361
...this unidentified Good Samaritan,
who tried to help Gloria.

908
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:33,167
There's just one problem.

909
01:11:33,341 --> 01:11:35,809
What's that?

910
01:11:35,977 --> 01:11:41,244
The clock on the surveillance camera
is three seconds behind the 911 clock.

911
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:43,748
All right, and...?

912
01:11:43,919 --> 01:11:48,618
We think he made the call
before he killed her.

913
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:51,716
No.

914
01:11:51,893 --> 01:11:56,057
No, that doesn't make any sense,
because the numbers...

915
01:12:00,836 --> 01:12:03,066
The caller.

916
01:12:05,173 --> 01:12:06,572
It's the same guy.

917
01:12:07,042 --> 01:12:11,103
He called an ambulance
before he shot her.

918
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:13,008
Yeah.

919
01:12:13,181 --> 01:12:16,446
See, Cordell, his organs
were no good.

920
01:12:16,618 --> 01:12:22,682
This time, the shooter would make
sure the ambulance got a good lead.

921
01:12:22,858 --> 01:12:26,692
So he shot Gloria, then
he comes back with bandages...

922
01:12:26,862 --> 01:12:29,456
...and tries to keep her alive.

923
01:12:30,932 --> 01:12:33,423
Oh, my God.

924
01:12:36,304 --> 01:12:37,771
Okay.

925
01:12:37,939 --> 01:12:43,775
Could this Good Samaritan be the same
guy you saw at the ATM machine?

926
01:12:45,647 --> 01:12:48,878
I don't know.
Put a wig on him, maybe.

927
01:12:49,351 --> 01:12:51,751
A little dark makeup, he's Hispanic.

928
01:12:52,254 --> 01:12:54,085
You got those ATM tapes?

929
01:12:54,256 --> 01:12:57,384
No. You only told me
to bring this one.

930
01:12:57,726 --> 01:13:00,752
Yeah, well...

931
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:06,164
The ATM thing. The shooter probably
had them on the way anyway.

932
01:13:06,334 --> 01:13:09,826
They went to the wrong address,
so it doesn't matter.

933
01:13:10,472 --> 01:13:13,464
What do you think about
Lockridge for this?

934
01:13:13,642 --> 01:13:15,473
I don't know, maybe.

935
01:13:16,645 --> 01:13:22,015
Whoever got the list of organ donors
had to hack into the BOPRA computer.

936
01:13:22,183 --> 01:13:24,378
Lockridge is a computer man, right?

937
01:13:24,553 --> 01:13:28,250
And he lives and works in
my jurisdiction. Let's go.

938
01:13:32,761 --> 01:13:34,319
I have to go with you.

939
01:13:34,496 --> 01:13:38,956
No, get back to Raymond.
Take my car. I'll go with Jaye.

940
01:13:56,351 --> 01:14:00,412
Why don't you pop the trunk?
I'll put this stuff in the back.

941
01:14:13,368 --> 01:14:15,336
What the fuck is he doing?

942
01:14:21,209 --> 01:14:24,576
McCaleb! What are you doing?!

943
01:14:24,879 --> 01:14:27,643
You're killing me here.
What's going on?

944
01:15:14,896 --> 01:15:17,922
- You okay?
- Yeah. You okay?

945
01:15:18,099 --> 01:15:21,830
- Yeah.
- Let's go find Lockridge at work.

946
01:15:22,003 --> 01:15:25,131
What do you mean?
We just shot up the Valley.

947
01:15:25,306 --> 01:15:26,773
Did you hit anyone?

948
01:15:26,941 --> 01:15:30,104
- No, thank God.
- Neither did I. Let's go.

949
01:15:31,312 --> 01:15:32,745
Fuck.

950
01:15:33,581 --> 01:15:36,345
Mr. Lockridge didn't
come to work today.

951
01:15:36,518 --> 01:15:39,009
- Is he ill?
- He hasn't called...

952
01:15:39,454 --> 01:15:42,423
...and he didn't come
in yesterday either.

953
01:15:56,337 --> 01:15:58,635
Come here and look at this.

954
01:16:03,244 --> 01:16:06,179
Doesn't that look like
probable cause to you?

955
01:16:06,347 --> 01:16:08,008
Let's go.

956
01:16:08,216 --> 01:16:11,117
See if I remember how they did this.

957
01:16:16,458 --> 01:16:18,392
Shit.

958
01:16:27,068 --> 01:16:28,660
Her throat's been slit.

959
01:16:29,003 --> 01:16:32,200
She's been here a good 24 hours.

960
01:16:36,745 --> 01:16:38,713
You okay?

961
01:16:39,013 --> 01:16:40,947
Yeah.

962
01:16:42,083 --> 01:16:45,143
We got an APB out on Lockridge.

963
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:49,586
I might get suspended,
but you did real good, McCaleb.

964
01:16:49,758 --> 01:16:50,747
Real good.

965
01:16:50,925 --> 01:16:53,291
I hope so.

966
01:17:00,268 --> 01:17:04,534
I guess I'd better get home
and get my pills.

967
01:17:04,906 --> 01:17:06,669
Want some coffee?

968
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:12,304
No, go home. Get your pills.

969
01:17:20,355 --> 01:17:22,880
You still got company.

970
01:17:23,691 --> 01:17:25,852
How much beer do I owe you?

971
01:17:26,027 --> 01:17:27,051
Seven cases...

972
01:17:27,228 --> 01:17:31,562
...but since he's a good kid
and a great fisherman, I'll take two.

973
01:17:31,733 --> 01:17:34,293
I'll get you the check in the morning.

974
01:17:35,036 --> 01:17:37,504
That's what they all say.

975
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,538
Good night, Terry.

976
01:17:50,618 --> 01:17:52,210
- Hey.
- Hey, Mr. McCaleb.

977
01:17:52,387 --> 01:17:53,786
Howdy.

978
01:17:53,955 --> 01:17:55,422
- Hey.
- How are you?

979
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:59,651
Me and Buddy caught so many fish
he had to get more bait.

980
01:17:59,994 --> 01:18:04,988
- I caught six all by myself.
- Really? It must be a harbor record.

981
01:18:05,166 --> 01:18:08,499
It's "Buddy and I."
Finish your homework, Ray.

982
01:18:11,406 --> 01:18:13,397
So?

983
01:18:13,908 --> 01:18:16,502
I'm not sure yet,
but it's looking good.

984
01:18:16,678 --> 01:18:19,112
Okay. When will you know?

985
01:18:21,015 --> 01:18:23,677
Soon, hopefully.

986
01:18:27,989 --> 01:18:29,889
Thank you.

987
01:18:30,658 --> 01:18:32,683
For everything you've done.

988
01:18:32,861 --> 01:18:34,055
I'm impressed.

989
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:37,527
That's my dad.

990
01:18:37,699 --> 01:18:41,760
He used to take Glory and me fishing.

991
01:18:41,936 --> 01:18:43,267
A lot.

992
01:18:43,438 --> 01:18:44,928
When we were kids.

993
01:18:45,306 --> 01:18:48,275
You know, they're all gone.

994
01:18:49,577 --> 01:18:53,638
But I'm glad I can still smile
about her, you know?

995
01:18:54,549 --> 01:18:56,414
I couldn't at first.

996
01:18:56,584 --> 01:18:59,553
This is a cool gun, Mr. McCaleb.

997
01:19:03,691 --> 01:19:06,182
- Raymond...
- It's all over. Don't, no.

998
01:19:08,129 --> 01:19:11,155
You never, never touch a gun.

999
01:19:11,332 --> 01:19:13,892
See? You can look at it.

1000
01:19:14,302 --> 01:19:17,294
This is an eight-shot
Smith & Wesson.

1001
01:19:17,472 --> 01:19:20,600
We don't touch it.
I shouldn't have left it out.

1002
01:19:20,775 --> 01:19:24,836
You never play with this,
so stay right there. Understand?

1003
01:19:27,382 --> 01:19:29,509
What's this?

1004
01:19:32,253 --> 01:19:37,486
Oh, that's some code I was supposed
to break, but I never could do it.

1005
01:19:43,531 --> 01:19:46,261
- There's no one.
- What?

1006
01:19:46,868 --> 01:19:48,165
There's no 1.

1007
01:19:48,736 --> 01:19:52,069
"9-0-3-4-7-2-5-6-8."

1008
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:55,175
It's all the numbers, but no 1.

1009
01:19:55,343 --> 01:19:57,504
How about that? No 1 s.

1010
01:19:58,179 --> 01:20:01,671
Little man, come on.
We have to go. It's getting late.

1011
01:20:01,849 --> 01:20:04,113
- Can I stay?
- No.

1012
01:20:04,285 --> 01:20:08,449
- We gotta go. It's getting late.
- I don't want to.

1013
01:20:08,623 --> 01:20:11,615
We have to. Okay?

1014
01:20:11,793 --> 01:20:15,729
Were you just going to let me
sit here and eat alone?

1015
01:20:20,368 --> 01:20:25,237
Raymond loves this boat, and he was
wondering if he could spend the night.

1016
01:20:25,406 --> 01:20:29,240
Yeah, there's a berth in front
you can both share.

1017
01:21:07,749 --> 01:21:10,343
You don't have to hide it.

1018
01:21:34,375 --> 01:21:36,969
Show me your heart.

1019
01:21:37,512 --> 01:21:39,605
Show me.

1020
01:21:55,797 --> 01:21:59,324
- Somebody's up on deck.
- What's wrong?

1021
01:21:59,734 --> 01:22:03,329
- I don't know. Somebody's up there.
- Raymond.

1022
01:22:03,504 --> 01:22:06,803
No, too heavy for him.

1023
01:22:36,237 --> 01:22:40,003
- You son of a bitch!
- What the hell is going on here?

1024
01:22:40,608 --> 01:22:45,341
Jesus Christ! We came because the
captain wants you at the crime scene.

1025
01:22:45,746 --> 01:22:47,179
When this is over...

1026
01:22:48,049 --> 01:22:52,850
...you better get an ass transplant
because I'll tear you a new one!

1027
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:54,715
Damn, it's cold.

1028
01:22:58,659 --> 01:23:00,149
Out of the way, please.

1029
01:23:00,328 --> 01:23:04,094
There's McCaleb. Mr. McCaleb,
did you think this was over?

1030
01:23:04,265 --> 01:23:08,065
I can't comment, I don't know
anything about anything.

1031
01:23:09,437 --> 01:23:11,735
- Oh, no.
- What?

1032
01:23:14,542 --> 01:23:17,477
This is where I had my attack.

1033
01:23:24,952 --> 01:23:27,147
Lockridge.

1034
01:23:27,788 --> 01:23:32,316
James Lockridge, the guy who
found Cordell at the ATM machine.

1035
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:35,493
Looks like your Code Killer's back.

1036
01:23:38,332 --> 01:23:42,928
Happy Valentine's Day.
Way to make a comeback.

1037
01:23:43,104 --> 01:23:46,596
Some people get flowers,
some people get chocolates.

1038
01:23:47,074 --> 01:23:49,440
You get a dead guy.

1039
01:24:06,994 --> 01:24:08,723
- Hey!
- What's going on?

1040
01:24:13,668 --> 01:24:15,431
It's all right.

1041
01:24:27,582 --> 01:24:30,142
Paper said something you didn't like?

1042
01:24:32,954 --> 01:24:37,118
Ballistics will match this slug
with the one in Bolotov's mouth.

1043
01:24:37,291 --> 01:24:42,160
It was the Code Killer.
Torres, Cordell, Bolotov, all of them.

1044
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:44,230
What does that mean?

1045
01:24:44,465 --> 01:24:49,664
I shot him two years ago. The slug in
Bolotov's mouth is the one that hit him.

1046
01:24:49,837 --> 01:24:51,771
Now I'm back...

1047
01:24:51,939 --> 01:24:53,930
...and so is he.

1048
01:24:54,108 --> 01:24:59,774
Every second we're talking, you could
be trying to get this son of a bitch.

1049
01:24:59,947 --> 01:25:02,541
We got a lot of good
people out there.

1050
01:25:02,717 --> 01:25:03,706
You're right.

1051
01:25:03,884 --> 01:25:07,980
Better chance of breaking
this with you in here.

1052
01:25:08,155 --> 01:25:11,716
- Fuck you, Bureau man!
- Enough of that, detective.

1053
01:25:11,926 --> 01:25:14,258
Yes, sir.

1054
01:25:14,996 --> 01:25:20,195
This Code Killer likes to impress you.
Any idea why?

1055
01:25:20,935 --> 01:25:23,995
I had a media profile, so did he.

1056
01:25:24,171 --> 01:25:28,471
I guess he missed the matchup, me
and him on the news every night.

1057
01:25:28,643 --> 01:25:31,942
I thought once these guys started,
they didn't stop.

1058
01:25:32,113 --> 01:25:34,775
But your Codie's been
down for two years.

1059
01:25:34,949 --> 01:25:37,042
What do you make of that?

1060
01:25:37,218 --> 01:25:41,780
I don't know. I shot him. I always
figured he crawled off and died.

1061
01:25:41,956 --> 01:25:45,585
- What do the numbers mean?
- Don't know that either.

1062
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:50,697
We ran it by the computers at Cal,
by the code breakers at the NSA.

1063
01:25:50,865 --> 01:25:53,129
Nobody comes up with anything.

1064
01:25:53,301 --> 01:25:54,290
Except...

1065
01:25:54,635 --> 01:25:57,103
Except what?

1066
01:25:57,705 --> 01:25:59,866
There's no digit number one.

1067
01:26:00,041 --> 01:26:03,204
No 1, whatever that might mean.

1068
01:26:03,377 --> 01:26:06,540
Guys, step out. Give us a minute.

1069
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:14,581
Okay.

1070
01:26:14,755 --> 01:26:18,384
Just cop to cop, what's going on here?

1071
01:26:18,559 --> 01:26:22,859
Cordell, Gloria Torres...
He did them for me.

1072
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:26,193
Keep talking until I understand.

1073
01:26:26,801 --> 01:26:29,599
He missed the action. Me and him.

1074
01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:33,672
In order to get it back,
I needed a new heart, so...

1075
01:26:33,841 --> 01:26:36,639
...Happy Valentine's Day.

1076
01:26:37,144 --> 01:26:39,271
Holy shit.

1077
01:26:39,447 --> 01:26:43,816
Now the love letters are gonna start,
hot and heavy.

1078
01:26:50,257 --> 01:26:53,715
You might have the captain fooled,
but not me.

1079
01:26:53,894 --> 01:26:57,660
You got Torres' heart.
That makes you suspect number one.

1080
01:26:57,832 --> 01:27:01,393
What a waste of a good
Mexican's heart!

1081
01:27:03,537 --> 01:27:05,004
Get out of here.

1082
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:13,943
Graciella?

1083
01:27:16,650 --> 01:27:18,641
Raymond?

1084
01:28:06,767 --> 01:28:11,067
Hey, Ter!
Welcome to Davy Jones' locker.

1085
01:28:14,108 --> 01:28:16,599
Have you seen Graciella and Raymond?

1086
01:28:17,411 --> 01:28:21,541
They got tired of waiting for you.
They left about an hour ago.

1087
01:28:24,084 --> 01:28:26,882
You're all over the news, brother!

1088
01:28:33,727 --> 01:28:36,423
How long we been neighbors?

1089
01:28:36,597 --> 01:28:41,057
I don't know. I moved into the marina
about a week after you.

1090
01:28:48,742 --> 01:28:52,075
- Raise up your shirt.
- What?

1091
01:28:52,446 --> 01:28:54,710
Raise it up.

1092
01:28:57,284 --> 01:28:59,479
Now.

1093
01:29:12,633 --> 01:29:15,932
Come on, turn around.

1094
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:25,946
I'm the following sea, man.

1095
01:29:26,113 --> 01:29:29,014
I'm the one you need to watch out for.

1096
01:29:29,817 --> 01:29:32,581
When did you figure it out?

1097
01:29:35,022 --> 01:29:37,115
On the check.

1098
01:29:38,626 --> 01:29:40,685
"No one."

1099
01:29:41,662 --> 01:29:45,325
I had a little trouble
with the Jasper part.

1100
01:29:50,304 --> 01:29:55,003
I could've killed you if I wanted to.
I was behind you at the ATM.

1101
01:29:55,175 --> 01:29:59,942
I followed you to Kang's Market,
just like I followed Gloria Torres.

1102
01:30:00,114 --> 01:30:02,309
You sick son of a bitch.

1103
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:05,614
I studied her. I chose her.

1104
01:30:05,786 --> 01:30:08,152
She was my valentine to you.

1105
01:30:08,389 --> 01:30:10,084
I gave you life.

1106
01:30:10,658 --> 01:30:12,387
What else you wanna know?

1107
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:17,862
That necklace belonged to a girl
named Sunny. Lockridge's wife.

1108
01:30:23,003 --> 01:30:26,734
There's a story for every piece
of crap on that tray.

1109
01:30:26,907 --> 01:30:29,637
Come on, man.
You're mine forever.

1110
01:30:29,810 --> 01:30:32,301
Every breath you take belongs to me.

1111
01:30:32,479 --> 01:30:38,315
Every beat of that stolen heart is
the echo of my voice in your head.

1112
01:30:38,919 --> 01:30:40,284
Every day.

1113
01:30:40,988 --> 01:30:42,478
Always.

1114
01:30:42,723 --> 01:30:47,057
It depends on you. Pull that trigger,
you'll never see them again.

1115
01:30:47,227 --> 01:30:52,187
- What?
- Kill me, no one will find them.

1116
01:30:52,399 --> 01:30:55,493
They will die. Alone.

1117
01:30:55,669 --> 01:31:00,197
In a black hole.
And that will be on you.

1118
01:31:01,542 --> 01:31:05,842
You know me. You know I have them.

1119
01:31:06,013 --> 01:31:10,245
- What do you want?
- I want you to live.

1120
01:31:10,451 --> 01:31:12,316
I want me to live.

1121
01:31:12,486 --> 01:31:18,288
I want it all to start again, you know,
the battle between good and evil.

1122
01:31:19,026 --> 01:31:23,292
Can't you see I've been getting you
back to where you need to be?

1123
01:31:23,831 --> 01:31:25,492
I'm not interested.

1124
01:31:25,699 --> 01:31:29,658
Bullshit. That day in the car,
what did you say you felt?

1125
01:31:29,837 --> 01:31:31,532
What was the word?

1126
01:31:31,705 --> 01:31:36,199
You felt "connected." Shit.
I almost came when you said that.

1127
01:31:36,810 --> 01:31:39,870
Because that's us, Terry.
That's you and me.

1128
01:31:40,047 --> 01:31:42,572
It's us. We were meant to be.

1129
01:31:42,916 --> 01:31:46,750
We're Cain and Abel.
Kennedy and Oswald.

1130
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:50,754
We are shit in the bottom
of somebody's shoe.

1131
01:31:57,598 --> 01:32:00,158
I have to leave now.

1132
01:32:00,601 --> 01:32:03,399
And you're not gonna follow me.

1133
01:32:03,671 --> 01:32:06,765
You're not gonna scrape me off.

1134
01:32:09,943 --> 01:32:15,609
You'll sit by that pay phone and wait
for me to call you from time to time...

1135
01:32:15,783 --> 01:32:21,016
...and when I'm relocated and ready,
I'll let Graciella and Raymond go.

1136
01:32:21,188 --> 01:32:25,557
Then you and me, we can start again.

1137
01:32:27,861 --> 01:32:32,696
I hope you think of me
as often as I think of you.

1138
01:32:44,044 --> 01:32:45,238
God. Crazy!

1139
01:32:45,813 --> 01:32:48,304
Call an ambulance!

1140
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:53,048
You're gonna take me to them.

1141
01:32:57,458 --> 01:33:02,987
Keep that tight. That will pinch the
artery, and you won't bleed to death.

1142
01:33:03,764 --> 01:33:08,167
- Now, show me.
- Okay.

1143
01:33:23,083 --> 01:33:26,177
What's it like having a chick's heart?

1144
01:33:27,488 --> 01:33:29,422
You start watching soaps?

1145
01:33:30,824 --> 01:33:33,759
Get cranky at the end of the month?

1146
01:33:35,028 --> 01:33:38,828
Hear some love song on the radio,
you start crying?

1147
01:33:38,999 --> 01:33:42,992
Plus it's a spic heart.
She was a wetback.

1148
01:33:43,170 --> 01:33:48,130
You wake up going, "Arriba! Gotta get
me some enchiladas for the cholita."

1149
01:33:48,308 --> 01:33:50,333
Shut up!

1150
01:33:51,745 --> 01:33:55,078
When they were girls going
to Sunday school...

1151
01:33:55,249 --> 01:33:58,616
...do you think Gloria Torres
ever thought that her heart...

1152
01:33:58,786 --> 01:34:04,816
...would be pumping blood through some
guy that was banging her sister?

1153
01:34:11,865 --> 01:34:14,390
You don't look so good, Ter.

1154
01:34:15,669 --> 01:34:19,002
You don't look so good
yourself there, Buddy.

1155
01:34:34,388 --> 01:34:37,687
Ran aground in that storm
last year. Remember?

1156
01:34:37,858 --> 01:34:41,589
Salvage company's gonna demo
it next week.

1157
01:34:41,762 --> 01:34:44,822
Till then, it's a perfect prison.

1158
01:34:45,065 --> 01:34:46,896
Better than Alcatraz.

1159
01:34:47,067 --> 01:34:49,865
My little shop of horrors.

1160
01:34:51,138 --> 01:34:53,572
Just so you know...

1161
01:34:54,308 --> 01:34:57,607
...I would never hurt that little boy.

1162
01:34:57,778 --> 01:35:02,078
See, he's the same blood type.
He's the backup.

1163
01:35:02,316 --> 01:35:05,615
In case anything happens
to his mom's heart.

1164
01:35:29,243 --> 01:35:30,733
Come on.

1165
01:35:30,911 --> 01:35:34,642
Do you think you have a chance?
With Graciella?

1166
01:35:34,815 --> 01:35:36,646
You think she can love you?

1167
01:35:36,817 --> 01:35:41,186
After her sister died for you?
That's tough for her to get around.

1168
01:35:41,355 --> 01:35:44,688
Let's go. Let's get going.

1169
01:35:49,162 --> 01:35:52,029
You can put the belt in your teeth.

1170
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:02,465
Follow me.

1171
01:36:57,030 --> 01:36:59,089
In there.

1172
01:37:05,038 --> 01:37:07,006
The key.

1173
01:37:47,247 --> 01:37:49,579
- Hey.
- Hey.

1174
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:51,718
Come on.

1175
01:37:52,085 --> 01:37:54,246
I knew you'd find us, Terry.

1176
01:37:54,621 --> 01:37:59,422
He may be on the boat, but I'm not
sure if he's dead or alive. Let's go.

1177
01:39:08,195 --> 01:39:10,789
Did your father teach
you to run a boat?

1178
01:39:10,964 --> 01:39:13,933
- Yeah.
- My boat's at the end of this gangway.

1179
01:39:14,101 --> 01:39:17,559
Wait a few minutes,
then go on down there.

1180
01:39:17,737 --> 01:39:20,297
Use this knife to cut the lines.

1181
01:39:20,474 --> 01:39:24,570
Back off about 100 yards or more
and wait till I call you.

1182
01:39:24,911 --> 01:39:26,708
- All right?
- Yeah.

1183
01:39:27,013 --> 01:39:31,143
If I don't call you in a half-hour,
get the hell out of here.

1184
01:39:32,486 --> 01:39:35,046
Okay. Get going.

1185
01:39:35,489 --> 01:39:38,515
Let's go. Come on, honey.

1186
01:39:43,563 --> 01:39:46,726
I'm sad, Terry!

1187
01:40:50,497 --> 01:40:53,489
Get inside. Hurry up.

1188
01:42:12,112 --> 01:42:14,273
Get down below, Raymond!

1189
01:42:54,554 --> 01:42:56,681
Come on, man.

1190
01:42:57,057 --> 01:42:58,581
We're connected.

1191
01:42:59,125 --> 01:43:01,650
Think of what you're doing.

1192
01:43:02,362 --> 01:43:04,159
You need me.

1193
01:43:05,231 --> 01:43:07,392
No, Buddy.

1194
01:43:07,567 --> 01:43:12,334
Remember how you said I was your
friend and I could tell you the truth?

1195
01:43:13,473 --> 01:43:16,636
Well, I don't need you at all.

1196
01:43:30,657 --> 01:43:32,784
Ten ring.

1197
01:43:39,999 --> 01:43:42,797
I saved you.

1198
01:44:01,321 --> 01:44:04,085
- Right next to you the whole time.
- Yeah.

1199
01:44:04,257 --> 01:44:05,622
You okay?

1200
01:44:05,792 --> 01:44:09,523
Yeah, I'm okay.
Never felt better.

1201
01:44:09,696 --> 01:44:12,164
You got his ass.

1202
01:44:12,332 --> 01:44:15,130
Yeah, there's "no one" anymore.

1203
01:44:15,335 --> 01:44:19,772
Give me a day to catch my breath,
I'll write you a full report.

1204
01:44:19,939 --> 01:44:22,134
I want to see it.

1205
01:44:22,308 --> 01:44:23,707
Two of them okay?

1206
01:44:23,877 --> 01:44:26,311
Yeah, if everyone will
leave them alone...

1207
01:44:26,479 --> 01:44:28,970
...not get them any more involved.

1208
01:44:29,149 --> 01:44:32,812
- I'll see what I can do about that.
- That's a pal.

1209
01:44:32,986 --> 01:44:36,114
How are you planning
to deal with all this?

1210
01:44:39,626 --> 01:44:42,322
Well, I've got Gloria Torres' heart.

1211
01:44:42,495 --> 01:44:44,986
I'll probably just let that guide me.

1212
01:44:45,899 --> 01:44:49,198
- You got anyone, Jaye?
- Excuse me?

1213
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:53,234
Police work can get
kind of heavy on you.

1214
01:44:53,406 --> 01:44:56,000
You got anyone at home?

1215
01:45:01,314 --> 01:45:05,011
Yeah, I got someone.

1216
01:45:05,752 --> 01:45:07,344
Good.

1217
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:08,817
McCaleb!

1218
01:45:08,988 --> 01:45:12,981
That's it! I'm sick and tired of your
grandstanding bullshit!

1219
01:45:13,159 --> 01:45:15,923
- You're out of your jurisdiction.
- Maybe.

1220
01:45:16,095 --> 01:45:21,294
But just because you got a Mexican's
heart, it don't make you one of us!

1221
01:45:22,335 --> 01:45:24,303
Arrango?

1222
01:45:24,737 --> 01:45:29,538
Next time you come around this dock,
this Mexican will kick your ass.

1223
01:45:29,709 --> 01:45:34,169
What? You're out of your
goddamn mind!

1224
01:45:36,182 --> 01:45:38,707
All my life, I've had the shitty jobs.

1225
01:45:38,885 --> 01:45:41,479
You got him talking to himself.

1226
01:45:42,789 --> 01:45:45,519
I didn't even know he spoke Spanish.

1227
01:45:52,098 --> 01:45:55,659
Poor baby, he's been
at this all morning.

1228
01:45:59,405 --> 01:46:03,705
I wish I could get a big, fat marlin
and put it on his line.

1229
