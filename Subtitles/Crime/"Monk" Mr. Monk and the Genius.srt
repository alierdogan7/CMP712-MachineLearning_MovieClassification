1
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:05,502
Payable to Natalie.

2
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:10,066
Teeger.

3
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,668
My four favorite words.

4
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,946
Thank you.

5
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,543
Thank you very much.

6
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,857
Um...

7
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,824
Excuse me.
Where's the rest of it?

8
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,919
I worked Tuesday night.
Remember? That was overtime.

9
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,361
Oh?

10
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,956
I thought you were
just hanging out.

11
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:09,433
No. Mr. Monk,
I wasn't just hanging out.

12
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,630
I spent seven hours
reorganizing the
utensil drawer.

13
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,195
That was work.

14
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,765
But you said it was fun.

15
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,403
I distinctly remember that.

16
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,745
I said, "Isn't this fun?"
And you said, "Uh-huh."

17
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:26,246
So...

18
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,654
You mean unless I'm
complaining, you're
not going to pay me?

19
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,418
Is that the new rule?

20
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:36,223
Even if I wanted to.
I've already torn it
out of the checkbook.

21
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,594
Yeah. So, you
just void it out.

22
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,599
Void. Write "void."
And then, you just
write another one.

23
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,635
Natalie.

24
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:45,500
I can't do that.
I wish I could.

25
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,836
If it were up to me...
Of course it's up to you.

26
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,841
I need you to use
your inside voice.
What?

27
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,638
Oh, my God!
All right.

28
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:52,769
God!

29
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,280
I'm a little short of
cash right now. Okay?

30
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:58,010
But I'm good for it.
You know I'm good for it.
Just keep track.

31
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,985
Yeah. I have been
keeping track.
It's over $1,800, Mr. Monk.

32
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,818
I'm sorry.
The door was open.

33
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,257
I thought I heard screaming.

34
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,760
Oh, no. That was just me.

35
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,318
I scream every payday.

36
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,658
Can I help you?

37
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,665
My name is Linda Kloster.

38
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,325
My husband is Patrick Kloster.

39
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,598
Patrick. The chess player.
I was just reading about him.

40
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,936
He's some sort
of super genius.
Like, off the charts.

41
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:24,875
Yes. Patrick has
an I.Q. of 180.

42
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,809
Four points higher
than Albert Einstein's.

43
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,075
What can I do for you?

44
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,879
Well, it's my husband.
He's going to kill someone.

45
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,049
How do you know?

46
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,111
He told me. He talks
about it all the time.

47
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,680
He says he has a perfect plan.
He says it's foolproof,

48
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,350
and that he'll
never get caught.

49
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,417
Did he say who
he's going to kill?

50
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,553
Yes.

51
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,026
It's me.

52
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,467
He's going to kill me.

53
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,540
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

54
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:59,977
<i>Disorder and
confusion everywhere</i>

55
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:02,173

56
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:03,340
<i>Well, I do</i>

57
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,385
<i>Hey, who's in charge here?</i>

58
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:10,115

59
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,421

00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:16,918

62
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:20,193

66
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,170

00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,937

70
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,947

00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,459
Can I get you
something to drink?
We have some wine.

74
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,831
Oh, no. Thank you.
I'm three years sober.

75
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,062
Well, three years
and two months.

76
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,160
Congratulations.

77
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:03,870
Mrs. Kloster,
isn't it possible that you
misunderstood your husband?

78
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,275
Patrick is not
an ambiguous man.

79
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:10,874
He said he's going
to kill me. In fact,
he tells me every day.

80
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,247
As I'm going to
bed, he'll say,

81
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,843
"Goodnight, sweetheart.
It won't be long, now."

82
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,381
Why don't you
go to the police?

83
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,392
I can't prove anything,
and he knows it.

84
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,893
It will be his word
against mine.

85
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,724
Well, can't you leave?
Go someplace?

86
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,492
You mean hide?
From Patrick?

87
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,535
Impossible. He'd find
me in two minutes.

88
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,662
He's a chess grand master.
The best in the world.

89
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,673
He can anticipate
my every move.

90
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,402
Murdering me is going
to make him a fortune.

91
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,411
He's taken out
a 10-million-dollar
insurance policy on my life.

92
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,969
Did he say when he'd...

93
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,242
No. But it will be soon.

94
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,877
And when he left this morning,
the way he kissed me...

95
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,478
It was different.
You know, the way he smiled.

96
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,544
It's definitely coming.

97
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,113
Where is he now?

98
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:55,627
He's playing a tournament
in Vancouver.
I've been following it.

99
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,596
That's right. He's in
Canada until Tuesday.

100
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,963
Well, at least you're
safe until then.

101
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,899
Am I?

102
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,563
Mrs. Kloster, I have
friends at the department.

103
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,232
Oh, I really appreciate
that, Mr. Monk.

104
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,242
But the police
can't protect me.

105
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,676
Patrick is smarter than
all of them put together.

106
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:16,181
My husband is going
to murder me.
I'm already dead.

107
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:19,480
And there's nothing you
or anyone can do about it.

108
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,750
Here's a check for $5,000.

109
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,949
I'm a little confused.

110
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,925
If you don't think
he can be stopped...

111
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,963
I'm hiring you, to catch him.

112
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,464
You mean after...
That's right.

113
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,161
After he's killed me.

114
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:40,001
Mr. Monk, you are the only man
smart enough in this world

115
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,065
to make him pay
for what he did.

116
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,576
Or rather, what
he's going to do.

117
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:48,678
I can't...

118
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,741
I don't know what to say.

119
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:59,383
Say yes, Mr. Monk.
Promise me.

120
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,485
Promise me you won't
let him get away with it.

121
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,830
I promise.

122
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,803
<i>MAN ON TV: Once again,
Kloster is on the attack.</i>

123
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:20,744
<i>His dynamic style of play
has certainly been
on display today.</i>

124
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,879
Your sister called again.

125
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,885
She's worried about you.
Frankly, so am I.

126
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,553
Looks like
he's winning again.

127
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,615
I'm sure he is.

128
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:34,751
Is the house alarm on?

129
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,091
Yes. I set it myself.

130
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,357
You'll check it again
before you leave?

131
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,262
I always do.

132
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,933
Don't open the
door for anyone.

133
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,979
Make sure Michael knows.

134
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,179
Let me make you some lunch.

135
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:03,348
You know, I think I'm
just going to take a bath
and maybe lie down.

136
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,722
I'm going to make
you a sandwich
I'll be right back.

137
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,260
How does she look?

138
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,926
Scared to death.

139
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,096
Of what? The son of
a bitch is in Canada.

140
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,833
I don't blame her.

141
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:25,900
What she needs is a good
therapist. They both do.

142
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,779
I'm happy I'm not a genius.

143
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,612
It screws with your head.

144
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:35,245
You want to do her a favor?
Put a little scotch in there.

145
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,284
<i>MAN ON TV: And it's another
victory for Patrick Kloster.</i>

146
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,890
We didn't have
any green tea.

147
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,928
But I found some Earl Grey.

148
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,001
Kevin, it's a
restraining order.

149
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,268
You issue 30 of them a day.

150
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,072
No, he hasn't hit her, I...

151
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,375
Yes, she's still in the house.

152
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,544
Because Adrian Monk told me.
That's how I know.

153
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,713
Fine. Good. You do that.
You sleep on it. Good.

154
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,585
How did that go?

155
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,649
Forget about him. Look,

156
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,322
just get a cruiser
out there. Park it out
front until further notice.

157
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,797
You got it.
You can't arrest
him for anything?

158
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,700
Well, apparently, there's
no law against giving
your wife the willies.

159
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,703
Captain, we just got a call.

160
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,068
Okay.

161
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,440
You'd better put down
the cup.

162
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,498
Just tell me who
called, Randy.

163
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,067
Just put the cup down
or finish it or
drink half of it.

164
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,806
Why?
Because you're

165
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,406
probably going to drop it
and I'm going to
have to clean it up and...

166
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,883
Just have a sip.
How about a sip?

167
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,923
Linda Kloster's dead.
Her housekeeper
just found her.

168
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,692
What happened?
I don't know. I...

169
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,289
Let's go.
Wait. Mr. Monk!

170
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,699
Let's go! We've got
to get over there.

171
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:57,929
Let's go, Randy.

172
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,220
Hey. The cavalry is here.

173
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,019
Could I have the room, please?

174
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:22,185
You heard the man.
He wants the room. Let's go.

175
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,698
Thank you very much.

176
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,528
Mr. Monk.
Not now.

177
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,760
Not now.

178
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,096
You can't blame yourself.

179
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,470
Yes, I can.

180
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,681
What did the paramedics say?

181
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,156
Probable heart attack.

182
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,621
He killed her.

183
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,433
He said he would kill her.
And he did it.

184
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,296
Okay.

185
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,633
Okay. There was no alarm.

186
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:45,165
There was no one in the house.
Just the housekeeper
and the cook.

187
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,678
No signs of trauma
or suffocation.

188
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,543
Poison.

189
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,141
No. Housekeepers said
she hadn't eaten all day.

190
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,846
Breakfast, lunch.

191
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,919
So, how did he do it?

192
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,850
I don't know.

193
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,254
I don't know.

194
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,463
Is he here?

195
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,527
The plane just landed.
What have you got?

196
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,596
You're not going to like it.

197
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,507
The ME said
natural causes.
Severe cardiac arrest.

198
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,170
What?
He's already
released the body.

199
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,606
What...

200
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,116
What about a complete
toxicology work-up?

201
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,152
He won't do it, Monk.
Not without probable cause.

202
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:30,120
But she, she was
42 years old!

203
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,657
What about the water?
The tap water in the bathroom.

204
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,250
Checked.
Well, how about her lipstick?

205
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,454
We checked that, too.
I mean, the toothpaste.

206
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,896
Even her eye drops.
Everything in the house.
It's all, it's all clean.

207
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,593
He killed her.
He poisoned her.

208
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,158
But how?

209
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,898
There he is.
You can ask him yourself.

210
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,142
Mr. Kloster?
How do you feel?

211
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,839
How do I feel?
I'm still in shock.

212
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,746
Linda was my
reason for living.

213
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,945
"Thou detestable maw,
thou womb of death,

214
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,115
"Gorg'd with the dearest
morsel of the earth."

215
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,023
Where is that from?

216
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,225
Look it up.
Dr. Kloster.

217
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,059
I'm Leland Stottlemeyer.
SFPD.

218
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,462
This is Lieutenant Disher.

219
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,693
Are you surprised
to see us, sir?

220
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,933
Yes. I am.

221
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,974
I mean, I'm surprised to
see you here. I expected
you in Vancouver.

222
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,306
Yeah, well, we
couldn't afford it.

223
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,845
Look. We're sorry
for your loss, sir.

224
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,711
This is Adrian Monk.
And Natalie Teeger.

225
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,148
Of course.

226
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,852
The legendary Mr. Monk.

227
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,650
I was hoping to see you here.

228
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,227
Hello.

229
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:45,354
Sir, we were wondering
if you would come downtown

230
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,796
and give us a statement.

231
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,198
I'm afraid my schedule
is rather tight.

232
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:53,864
But I did take the
opportunity of phoning
ahead and reserving a room.

233
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,306
Here. At the airport
security offices.

234
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:03,839
It's nothing extravagant,
but there is a table.
And five chairs.

235
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,015
How did you know
there would be five of us?

236
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,681
Please, Miss Teeger.
Don't insult me.

237
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:28,030
According to the Vancouver
police, they interrupted
the match at 1:21 p.m.

238
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,369
to inform you that
your wife had died.

239
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,703
That's right.

240
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,609
And they said you
kept playing.
That you finished the match.

241
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,307
Of course I did.
That's what Linda
would have wanted.

242
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:39,874
It's funny. I would have
been too upset to concentrate.

243
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:44,321
I was upset, Captain.
That's why it took
me 44 moves to win.

244
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:50,358
Your wife came to see
me this morning, Mr. Kloster.

245
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,487
Did she?

246
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:56,263
She told me that you'd
been planning to kill her.

247
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,599
My wife was
an unstable woman.

248
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,970
She didn't seem
unstable to me.

249
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,906
I'm sure she didn't.

250
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,309
What did the medical
examiner say?

251
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,846
Heart attack.

252
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,314
Yeah, she didn't
look sick to me.

253
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:14,682
And what medical school
did you attend, Miss Teeger?

254
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,653
My wife suffered from
high blood pressure.

255
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:20,681
And for most of her life,
she was an alcoholic
and a heavy smoker.

256
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,951
She was also quite depressed.

257
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,464
And there was
a 10-million-dollar
life insurance policy.

258
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,525
The policy was Linda's idea.
I'm insured for
the same amount.

259
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,470
What do you know about
poison, Mr. Kloster?

260
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,301
Not much. More than you,
I'm sure. But not much.

261
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,403
Although I am an expert
on the Poison Pawn.

262
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,171
Poison...

263
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,581
That is a chess move,
Lieutenant Disher.

264
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,881
I'd be glad to teach it
to you, if you'd like.

265
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:54,285
Well, as you can imagine,
I have a number of
arrangements to make.

266
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,053
Do you play chess,
Mr. Monk?

267
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,619
A little.

268
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,961
We should play
a game sometime.

269
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,364
We already are.

270
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:11,006
Okay. I found somebody.
He's a grand master
national champion.

271
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,338
And he beat Patrick Kloster?

272
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,879
Almost. They played
last year. It was a tie.

273
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,039
Well, where is he?

274
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,743
He's over there.
His name is Eric Tavela.

275
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,286
I can't believe you're
working on a Saturday.

276
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,482
Well, he's not paying me,
so, it's not really work.

277
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,957
Mr. Tavela,
do you have a minute?

278
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,517
A little busy at the moment.

279
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,563
You're, you're Tavela?

280
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,365
I wanted to ask you
a couple of questions
about Patrick Kloster.

281
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,335
You know, I'm working here.
You want to talk
you've got to play me.

282
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,099
It's 20 bucks.

283
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:45,339
Yeah. I don't. I don't...
I don't think I have
20 dollars. I don't...

284
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,608
I don't have 20
dollars. I don't...

285
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:52,412
Do you, do you have any...
I don't think I have twenties.

286
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,883
I have eight dollars.

287
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:59,317
And an I.O.U.
for $1,800 from my boss.

288
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,790
Who's next?

289
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,356
I can play.

290
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,897
Five dollars, right?
I'm under 18.

291
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,865
You play chess?

292
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,030
I was in the chess club
for two semesters.

293
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:13,797
Two semesters.

294
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:17,171
Ooh! That's gonna impress
the Vassar Dean of Admissions.

295
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,135
It's your move.

296
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,775
The Bird Opening.

297
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,446
I've only seen
that five times today.

298
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,884
I understand that you
almost beat Patrick Kloster.

299
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,358
I'll get him next time.

300
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,725
What kind of player
is he, would you say?

301
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:41,232
Kloster's a behaviorist.
He studies you. Not the game.

302
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:45,329
He crawls inside your head.
It's kind of spooky.

303
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,202
Yeah.
What is a Poison Pawn?

304
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,533
Well, the Poison Pawn
is a trap.

305
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,135
He dangles a pawn
in the middle of the board.

306
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,875
You know, most
people can't resist it.

307
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,751
And then he swoops in.

308
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,314
And crushes you.

309
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,086
They can't resist it.

310
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,356
That's checkmate.
Thank you, Vassar.
That was fun.

311
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:15,866
A trap. A trap she
couldn't resist.

312
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:19,233
What, what, what, what?
I know that look.
You did it, didn't you?

313
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:22,364
You figured it out.
Who's the real
genius now, huh?

314
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,899
Who just outsmarted
the smartest guy in the
whole world? Tell me who.

315
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,172
I did.

316
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,813
This is a funeral
home, Mr. Monk.

317
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,657
My wife has just passed.

318
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:45,054
I find that grin on your
face rather inappropriate.

319
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,995
I know how you did it.

320
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,300
You still think I
murdered my wife?

321
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,461
You set a trap.

322
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:52,799
Like the Poison Pawn.

323
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:57,937
Oh, you've been chatting
with some chess masters.
Good for you.

324
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,571
When I was in your
bedroom on Wednesday,
I noticed a few things.

325
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:04,172
I just didn't put it
all together until today.

326
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,984
<i>A glass that had
recently been washed.</i>

327
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,613
<i>Some breath mints.
Some eye drops.</i>

328
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,123
And what did they tell you?

329
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,217
That your wife had
started drinking again.

330
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,627
<i>NATALIE: Married to you,
I don't blame her.</i>

331
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:22,133
<i>MONK: She kept it
secret, of course.
At least, she tried to.</i>

332
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:33,539
How long did it take you
to find her secret stash?
A day? A week?

333
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:38,409
<i>On Wednesday morning,
before you left for Canada,
you poisoned her bottle.</i>

334
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,476
<i>Then put it back
where you found it.</i>

335
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,578
<i>Later that day,
Linda took a drink.</i>

336
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,020
<i>NATALIE: The Poison Pawn.</i>

337
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,457
<i>MONK: Then, she put
the bottle back.
As you knew she would.</i>

338
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,489
It really was brilliant.

339
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:55,966
You didn't have to hide
the poison. She would drink
it, then hide it herself.

340
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,002
Natalie, call the Captain.
Yes, sir.

341
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:03,030
And did you find this bottle?
This hidden stash?
With the poison?

342
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,668
No. Of course not.
It's long gone.

343
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,712
You've had four days
to get rid of it.

344
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:14,285
But there are still
traces of it in here.
In her body.

345
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,789
We're going to run every
toxicology test in the book,

346
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,290
and we're going to find it.

347
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,123
I'm afraid you can't
touch that. I'm sorry.

348
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,856
She was our niece.

349
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,096
Well, I'm a former
police officer,

350
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,398
and I'm afraid we have to
borrow your niece,

351
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,937
her remains, for
a couple of days.

352
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,097
Borrow her?

353
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,733
Yes, we have to run some
toxicology tests on the body.

354
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:37,866
Oh, my goodness.

355
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,002
No, no, no.
We do it all the time.

356
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,876
We're going to cut her open

357
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:46,213
just, just a little bit

358
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,343
and

359
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,487
slice off a teeny-tiny...

360
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,818
Tiny piece of her liver.

361
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,192
And her stomach. And maybe...

362
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:01,994
Take a little... Tiny,

363
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,228
nearly imperceptible bit
of fluid from her eyeball.

364
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,100
Like on TV.
Who likes TV?

365
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,399
But why?

366
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,639
The fact is, we think
she may have been poisoned.

367
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,645
But how did the poison
get in the cable car?

368
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,781
What cable car?
The cable car that hit her.

369
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,147
That's how
Marjorie was killed.

370
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,812
Mr. Monk?
That's not my wife.

371
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,494
My wife is right here.

372
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,067
I had her cremated
two hours ago.

373
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:41,868
As you can see,
I have anticipated
your every move.

374
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,168
Cremated.

375
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,802
Yes. I don't think your
toxicology tests are
going to do much good.

376
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,004
But you are welcome to try.

377
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,074
Oh, I know that look.

378
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,716
I've seen it quite often.

379
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:57,118
It's how my opponents
look when they know
they've been beaten.

380
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,220
Your move, Mr. Monk.

381
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:11,765
"In chess, as in life,
creative strategies executed
with daring and precision

382
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:17,002
"will allow you to
overwhelm your opponent and
achieve your goal." The end.

383
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,543
And may I say, "Thank God."

384
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,873
Keep reading.
Here's the next one.

385
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,244
Oh, Mr. Monk, come on.
We've been reading
his books all day.

386
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,612
What good are they doing?

387
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:28,244
I'm getting into his head.
He's in my head.

388
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,724
I have to be in his head.
So, we're in each
other's heads.

389
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,825
<i>Chess Domination</i>
by Patrick Kloster.

390
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,162
Well, this will be
the opposite of fun.

391
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,997
"For my queen, Tatiana."

392
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,969
You don't have to
read the dedication.

393
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:49,633
Fine, sorry. What's this?
Linda Kloster's check.

394
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,903
You didn't deposit this?
I'll never deposit it.

395
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,309
But Mr. Monk, she
wanted you to cash it.

396
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,940
Mr. Monk, if you
deposit this check, then
you can pay your staff.

397
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,382
And when I say
staff, I mean me.

398
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:05,421
She came to me.
I didn't protect her.

399
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,458
Mr. Monk, you did
everything you could.

400
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,427
What about the promise
I made that he wouldn't
get away with it?

401
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,520
You made a
promise to me, too...
There he is.

402
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:13,621
What?
My God.

403
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,259
Oh, my God. He's coming.
What do we do? We should kiss.

404
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,736
No! I didn't say that.
I wasn't thinking.
I never said that.

405
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,068
Good morning.
I thought you
might be thirsty.

406
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:29,170
Well, this is for
you, Natalie.

407
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,010
It's lemonade.

408
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,052
And, Mr. Monk, I believe
this is your brand.

409
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,287
Wow. My books.

410
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,621
I could autograph
one for you.

411
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,184
No, thank you. No.

412
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:48,630
Very well.
I'll leave you two alone.

413
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,262
Enjoy your little stake-out.

414
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,542
Well, you have to admit.
He's pretty good.

415
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,582
What? He was right.
I was thirsty.

416
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,081
What?

417
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,124
How do you feel?

418
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,624
I feel fine.

419
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:17,990
What?

420
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,894
It just occurred to me.

421
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,695
If there's poison in
that lemonade, we
could go to the DA

422
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:25,100
and we'd have all
the evidence we need.

423
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,003
It just occurred to you?
And you didn't say anything?

424
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,270
My God, Mr. Monk,
I have never
seen you like this!

425
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,141
How're you feeling now?
You know, I hate
to disappoint you,

426
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,009
but I feel fine.
Try the water.

427
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,914
Oh, my God. That's it.
We are going home.

428
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:45,087
Wait. Stop the car.

429
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,852
What. What.
What are you doing?

430
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,358
Just stop, stop, stop the car.
No!

431
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,292
Wait! What are you doing?

432
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,297
Where are you going?
His garden.

433
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,730
His garden?

434
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,136
Oleander.
It's from his garden.

435
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,003
It's poisonous.
Very poisonous.

436
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,440
You dry the sap,
you grind it into a powder.

437
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,478
A quarter of a gram is
enough to kill an adult.

438
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:08,604
It would look like
she had a heart attack.

439
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,911
It did look like she
had a heart attack.
This is how he did it.

440
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,451
So, you were in his garden?
On his property?

441
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,546
You said you wanted evidence.
Hard evidence. Here it is.

442
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:22,184
Monk, a million people
have this flower in their
garden. I used to have some.

443
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,421
Let's let the DA decide.

444
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:28,791
Monk, I am not going
to the DA waving a shrub.

445
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,867
Look. You don't
seem to understand.

446
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:37,500
This Patrick Kloster
thing is a big, bad headline
just waiting to happen.

447
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:42,980
Now, I know that you're upset.
I know that this case is
very important to you.

448
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,414
But we need real,
hard evidence.

449
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,410
Maybe if you found some
powder already ground up

450
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,818
in a little bottle
inside his house.

451
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,082
Maybe then.

452
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,487
In a bottle?

453
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,657
Right. We wouldn't
even need his fingerprints.

454
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,129
We could just say
he wore gloves.

455
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,326
What did you say?

456
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,465
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

457
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:08,801
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

458
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,104
Come here. I want to
show you something.
What is it?

459
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,110
Down the hall, there's a sign.
I think it's a little crooked.

460
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,304
I want your opinion.

461
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,574
Crooked? I'll be right back.

462
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:17,910
Come on.

463
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,712
How crooked is it?

464
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:22,344
Oh, it's very crooked.
You're not going
to believe it.

465
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,887
Why do you need me?

466
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,822
Because I'm not sure
if it is crooked.

467
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,792
You just said
it's very crooked.

468
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,658
Look. I don't know,
Monk. It's...

469
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,924
Is anybody else in there?

470
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,625
Mmm-mmm.

471
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,857
It's in here.

472
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,706
There's nothing
crooked in here.

473
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:46,708
I hope not.

474
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:52,581
Don't do it.

475
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,143
Don't do what?

476
00:25:58,356 --> 00:25:59,914
Break my heart.

477
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,758
You're thinking about planting
evidence in Kloster's house.

478
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:15,004
Monk, I've been a cop
for 30 years. I've had this
conversation nine times.

479
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,133
I never thought that
I'd be having it with you.

480
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,769
There's a line.

481
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:26,513
You step across it,
and you're gone for good.
And there's no going back.

482
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,554
You don't understand.
I do understand.

483
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:33,819
I've been there.
I've had cases like this,
cases you couldn't shake.

484
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,993
Sometimes,
you have to let it go.

485
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,028
Let it go?

486
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,462
We have to move on.

487
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,826
There's a city.

488
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:48,964
A city full of people,
other people, that need
our help right now.

489
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,340
When Trudy was dying,

490
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,770
I got there late.
Almost too late.

491
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:57,974
I was there.

492
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:01,348
She was slipping away.
She couldn't speak.

493
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,713
All she could
do was reach out.

494
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,486
She...

495
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,328
She grabbed me
with both hands.

496
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:19,060
Just like this.

497
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,940
Eleven years later
I still feel it.

498
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:33,315
When I promised Linda Kloster,
when I gave her my solemn word

499
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:37,822
that her husband would pay,
she grabbed my hand

500
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,187
the exact same way.

501
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,728
I'm not letting this one go.

502
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,269
I'm not moving on.

503
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,020
That's an illegal
move, Mr. Monk.

504
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:56,188
Something I'd expect
from a much weaker player.

505
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,753
The truth is,
I have been waiting
for you all night.

506
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:00,889
I had almost given up.

507
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,126
You were waiting for me?
Hmm.

508
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:07,797
Ever since I noticed a
branch missing from an
oleander bush in my garden.

509
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:12,900
You don't really think that
window was left unlocked by
accident, do you, Mr. Monk?

510
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,446
Breaking and entering.

511
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,881
I believe that is a felony.

512
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:25,345
Don't worry,
I'm not a litigious man.

513
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:29,151
I prefer to settle my
problems out of court.

514
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,888
As you well know.

515
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,466
I am replaying a match
of mine from 1995.

516
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,869
Boris Spassky was
playing white.

517
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,740
Where would we be
without our little
games? Eh, Mr. Monk?

518
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,609
Sixty-four perfect
little squares.

519
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:53,310
An island of order
in a chaotic world.

520
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,213
This is where I beat him.
Right...

521
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:03,658
...there.

522
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,281
MONK: This is a wedding gift.

523
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,988
You dedicated one
of your books to
"My queen, Tatiana."

524
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,726
You were married before.

525
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:42,197
Very good, Mr. Monk.

526
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:45,999
Divorced?

527
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,863
My wife died.

528
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:52,741
She must have
been quite young.

529
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,437
Yes, she was.

530
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,374
Let me guess.

531
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,080
Heart attack.

532
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:11,161
JUDGE BARR: Mr. Kloster?
The District Attorney's office
and Captain Stottlemeyer

533
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:14,130
would like to exhume the
body of your first wife.

534
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:15,631
I've read their application.

535
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,158
They've listed a number
of similarities
between the two cases.

536
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:24,675
Your first wife, Tatiana Bay
Kloster, was in her thirties,
apparently healthy,

537
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:28,109
and died from a sudden
and severe cardiac event.

538
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:32,207
She, too, was heavily insured.

539
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,480
Captain Stottlemeyer
and Mr. Monk
have been to Pacifica.

540
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:38,249
They've spoken to some
of your old neighbors,

541
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:43,283
and a few of them remember
you had oleander plants in
your garden 15 years ago.

542
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:48,425
I'm convinced.
There's a clear and unique
pattern of behavior.

543
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:51,263
I am going to
grant this petition.

544
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,863
Your first wife's
body will be exhumed
first thing tomorrow.

545
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,066
And let me warn you.

546
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:01,805
If, in fact, there are traces
of this poison in her body

547
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:06,475
you can expect the
District Attorney's office to
bring two counts of murder.

548
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:12,955
CAPTAIN: Thank you, Judge.

549
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:16,857
Section 2-61.
Should be up there.

550
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,467
Here. Here it is.

551
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,136
Hey, hey! Over here!

552
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,874
You are making
a big mistake.

553
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,914
You made the mistake, Kloster.

554
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,912
You should have had
your first wife cremated, too.

555
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,286
Sorry for the delay.
We know how
important this is,

556
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,753
so we wanted to make sure.

557
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:48,349
There was no
poison in the body.
We didn't find a thing.

558
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:50,783
Impossible.

559
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,262
The woman died
of natural causes.

560
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,958
We're sure of it.

561
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,935
Thank you, Mr. Monk.

562
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:02,233
What for?

563
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,969
Our little game.
To be honest with you,

564
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,511
I'm sorry it's over.

565
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:21,190
M. C: Excuse us. There you go.
Gonna need you, young
man. Let's do this.

566
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,921
Hello, everybody.
Thank you so much for
your generous support.

567
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,156
We're going to begin
the exhibition in
just a few minutes.

568
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,131
International grand
master Patrick Kloster

569
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,531
will be playing
simultaneous matches

570
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:33,263
against four of
the highest-ranked
players in California.

571
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,862
It should prove to
be very exciting.

572
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,807
Oh, there's that kid from
the park. What a geep.

573
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:42,937
What's a "geep?"

574
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,648
I don't know.
It's a geek who's
a little creepy.

575
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:49,982
NATALIE: All right, Mr. Monk.
I have to be honest, I'm still
not quite sure why we're here.

576
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,420
He won't talk to you.
He won't return
your phone calls.

577
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,958
What can we do?
I don't know.

578
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,187
But I can't just quit.

579
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:00,025
To me, quitting would
be like giving up.

580
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,090
If I was playing
against him,

581
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,465
he'd have to
talk to me. Right?

582
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,997
Okay. Wait here.

583
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,608
What's she doing?

584
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,013
She's... She's flirting.

585
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,074
She's good at it.
Shut up.

586
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,585
She's definitely
done this before.

587
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:23,711
Okay.

588
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,155
Yeah. She's got it down.
Thank you.

589
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:31,787
Mom? You remember
my friend, Eric.

590
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:35,321
I told him about the case.
And about how you think

591
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,094
Mr. Kloster killed his wife.

592
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:38,192
I believe it, too.

593
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:41,033
Congratulations.
You're player number one.

594
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,300
You mean I can
play in the tournament?

595
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:47,868
You're my proxy. It's in
the bylaws. I can designate
someone to take my place.

596
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:49,037
Thank you.

597
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,876
Don't bring out your
queen too early.

598
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,483
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome
international grand master,

599
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,148
Patrick Kloster.

600
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:10,731
Well, well, well.
The tenacious Mr. Monk.

601
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,929
Your threshold for pain
must be extraordinary.

602
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,235
It's your move.
Yes. I know.

603
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:21,806
Linda must have truly
despised me, to have
brought you into my life.

604
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,749
Mr. Monk.

605
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:37,089
That's my piece, Mr. Monk.

606
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:40,187
I'm just centering it.
You'll thank me later.

607
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,388
Mr. Monk?

608
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:42,284
Mom.

609
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,418
Okay.

610
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,338
Mr. Monk.

611
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,438
Please.

612
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,875
I pass.

613
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,173
You can't pass.

614
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:09,575
For the love of God,
why don't you just resign?

615
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:12,145
How about this?
If I win this game,

616
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,385
you have to tell me how
you poisoned your wives.

617
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:21,156
What are you talking about?
I am not agreeing to that.

618
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,826
How about this?
If we play to a draw,

619
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,634
you come with me to
police headquarters.

620
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:29,571
Mr. Monk, I'm not
negotiating with you.

621
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,632
When are you going to
realize that it is over?

622
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:42,818
You're castling?

623
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,685
Yes, the rook and the
king switch places.

624
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,324
They switch places.

625
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:54,296
Yes. It's the best
way I know to get
oneself out of trouble.

626
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,453
This is it.

627
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:04,094
You came here that
night before we exhumed
your wife's body,

628
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,962
and switched headstones.

629
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:10,401
That's why we didn't
find any poison.

630
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,465
We dug up the wrong body.

631
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,410
Very good, Mr. Monk.

632
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,544
You play
a brilliant endgame.

633
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,552
All right.

634
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,886
Can I tell you something?
I am sick and tired
of you talking like this.

635
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:30,415
All these chess metaphors.
Two women are dead.

636
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:33,258
They're not chess
pieces, Patrick.
They're human beings.

637
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,491
I think they deserve better.

638
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,038
Although, if you insist...

639
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:45,839
Checkmate.

640
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:04,087
What?
Nothing.

641
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:07,756
I was just thinking about the
case and how you solved it.

642
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,232
You really are amazing.

643
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,325
Well...

644
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:14,235
Thank you.
No, you really are my hero.

645
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,831
Okay.
Now, I thought,
I know it sounds crazy,

646
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:20,968
Mr. Monk, but...
Could I have your autograph?

647
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,837
Oh, please.
Please! Just to have it.
For myself.

648
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:26,212
Like a keepsake. Come on.
It will just take a second.

649
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:29,275
All right. If it really
means something to you.

650
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:34,783
Okay.

651
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,758
Thank you.
That's Linda Kloster's check.

652
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,025
Which you just endorsed.
I'll be right back.
I'm going to the bank.

653
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,397
You can't deposit that.
Why not?

654
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,732
You solved the case.
You kept your promise.
Besides, I need the money.

655
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,669
Natalie, let, let go.
Just give it back.

656
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,707
I think those books
are out of order.
Where?

657
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,401
Nat...

658
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:58,045
Oh, my God.
They really are out of order.

659
