1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,750
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,880
No blood. What a gorgeous idea.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,010
Refrigerated truck. He wants a cold
environment to slow the flow of blood.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,390
I suppose I should be upset, but I'm not.

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,770
In fact, I think this is a friendly message, kind
of like, "Hey, wanna play?"

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,270
Kara, it's me. It's James.

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,860
You just opened a dangerous door.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,570
No, man. You did...

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,570
when you murdered a cop
and an innocent lady.

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,160
Was Kara sleeping with someone
other than Ricky?

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,530
Was it you?

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,040
What the fuck were you thinking?

13
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,620
Going out tonight with the guys,
blow off steam. You in?

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,870
Hey, man. Sounds good.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,750
I thought you said you wanted
to go get shit-faced.

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,500
I am shit-faced.

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,380
I showed my face to Guerrero, his whole
church. They're gonna think I'm behind this.

18
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,430
You fucked my sister.
You fucked a cop's wife.

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,930
Now you're just fucked, buddy.

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,480
He's escalating the thrill,

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,770
posing his victim in the middle of
a 20,000-seat arena

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,110
for all Miami to see,
to show us what he's capable of doing.

23
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,610
- What did I miss?
- Fingertips.

24
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,570
Fuckin'-A, that's my girl. This body belongs to
the frozen fingertips found in the truck.

25
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,910
Ladies and gentlemen,

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,700
I give you Tony Tucci, the ice-truck killer.

27
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:25,910
Bullshit.

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,170
Of course I agree with my sister,
but unlike her, I'm not upset.

29
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,250
He's still out there and I'm waiting...

30
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,380
breathless.

31
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,130
I find people around me

32
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,720
are all making some kind of connection,
like friendship or romance.

33
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,430
But human bonds always
lead to messy complications,

34
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,100
commitment, sharing,
driving people to the airport.

35
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,190
Besides, if I let someone get that close, they'd
see who I really am...

36
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,780
and I can't let that happen.

37
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,570
So, time to put on my mask.

38
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,080
- I need your expertise.
- I live to serve.

39
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,080
Excuse us, fellas.

40
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,420
Interesting hand job.

41
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,590
That's funny.

42
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,260
It is?

43
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,930
How long you think it's been there?

44
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,430
This feels familiar.

45
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,270
OK.

46
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,310
So, how long's it been there?

47
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,570
Blood stopped pooling, still wet,
couple hours at the most.

48
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,070
What time was it found?

49
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,580
A jogger called it in
this morning about 7:30.

50
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,290
No prints. Wiped clean.

51
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,410
Real creep show.

52
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,750
- Any sign of the rest of the body?
- Just Mr. Hand.

53
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,300
- Do you think this is our guy's work?
- The ice-truck killer?

54
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,930
It's hard to say.
There's blood. That's different.

55
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,010
Plus, it's a male victim,
haven't seen that before.

56
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,390
The cut appears to be almost delicate.

57
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,140
You see between the first and second row
of carpals... Very surgical.

58
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,820
Check out what else he left behind.

59
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,030
A postcard to remember him by.

60
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,700
How far is Rand Beach from here?

61
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,330
This is Rand Beach.

62
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,670
It was renamed Petrie Beach
a few years ago.

63
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,100
No, no, come on.

64
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,760
OK, everybody.

65
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,520
Everybody say...

66
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,060
"stinky feet."

67
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,400
Wait. Nobody move.
Dexter, were you smiling?

68
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,400
No.

69
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,740
We'll do another one.
This time everybody smile. You too, Dex.

70
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,080
- Yeah, pretend you're burning ants.
- Shut your damn face, Deb.

71
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,240
Language, please.

72
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,410
- What? She always talks like that.
- Enough, you two. Dexter, come here.

73
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,420
What's your problem?

74
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,260
I hate the beach. It's sandy and gross
and nasty, and I want to go home.

75
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,430
Too bad. You're part of a family.

76
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,060
And being part of a family
means smiling for photos.

77
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,390
Why should I pretend I'm happy?

78
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,100
Because it'll make your mom happy.

79
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,320
And because it's how you fit in.

80
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,940
- Remember we talked about that?
- Yeah.

81
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,450
This is how you do it. When somebody takes
your picture, you smile.

82
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,120
It doesn't matter if you're happy or not.

83
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,120
You just do it to fit in. OK?

84
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,830
- OK.
- All right.

85
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,920
Come here, handsome.

86
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,550
OK. Everybody ready?

87
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,430
One more time.

88
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,930
Stinky feet!

89
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,480
Yeah, I just need to stop by my
apartment to pick up a few labs.

90
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,610
Straight to the station after, yeah.
Thanks, Lieutenant.

91
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,660
Dexter Morgan...

92
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,450
this is your life.

93
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,420
It is my new friend,
the ice-truck killer.

94
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,170
When he broke into my apartment,
he took some time to get to know me,

95
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,630
my life.

96
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,470
My secrets.

97
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,650
..have brought in manpower from other
counties in an effort to expedite the search.

98
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,700
Officially, Mr. Tucci has not
been charged with any crime...

99
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,910
Then tell the fucking governor
to free up funds for overtime.

100
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,000
The more guys I got out there,
the sooner we find Tucci.

101
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,830
Kelly, I'll get back to you.

102
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,040
..is still the department's top priority.

103
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,750
What's wrong?

104
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,880
Fingerprint ID came back
on that hand from the beach.

105
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,140
It belongs to Tony Tucci,
your ice-truck killer suspect.

106
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,800
What?

107
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,180
Wait a minute.

108
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,270
No. No, no, no. No way.

109
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,440
No way.

110
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,940
I mean, this... This has to be a mistake.

111
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,570
The mistake was unleashing a high-profile
manhunt before you had all the facts.

112
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,080
Fuck.

113
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,420
OK. This doesn't mean
that Tucci is not the killer.

114
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,290
Don't.

115
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,050
Just.. Just don't.

116
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,970
You wanted to be on TV, well, get ready, cos
the press will annihilate us for this.

117
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,220
We'll be lucky if Tucci's mother
doesn't file a lawsuit.

118
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,100
All right.

119
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,440
You go talk to that woman.
Do your mea culpas.

120
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,110
If we handle this right...

121
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,940
maybe we can mitigate the fallout.

122
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,740
I'm the last person she wants to see.

123
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,660
I called her son a killer.

124
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,040
And now's your chance to make it right.

125
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,680
- LaGuerta screwed the pooch on this one.
- I'm taking point.

126
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,520
You can get all non-essentials off the beach.

127
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,270
- Secure and separate any witnesses.
- Will do.

128
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,150
What did the captain say?

129
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,320
Did he make her cry?

130
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,780
Just control the fucking beach, Angel.

131
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,660
I knew Tucci wasn't the killer. I knew it.

132
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,540
LaGuerta whipped up a manhunt
for a rent-a-cop.

133
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,420
I wish I could have been there
to see the captain rip her a new one.

134
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,710
Morgan, calm down.

135
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,300
LaGuerta insulted the killer's intelligence,

136
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,510
now he's getting back at us
for chasing after the wrong guy.

137
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,800
- You see all these people over here?
- Yeah.

138
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,930
- What are they?
- Potential witnesses.

139
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,430
And what do we do with
potential witnesses?

140
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,640
We...

141
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,650
We interview them.

142
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,110
Got it.

143
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,200
Where is he?

144
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,790
The rest of him?

145
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,790
We're... We're still looking.

146
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,750
The entire force is looking.
We're making every effort.

147
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,760
Are you sure it's Tony? Because...

148
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,090
Yes.

149
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,260
I'm afraid so.

150
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,390
Mrs. Tucci.

151
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,360
I said some very harsh things
about your son.

152
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,980
Thank you.

153
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,200
"Thank you"? For what?

154
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,530
For coming to tell me in person.

155
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,790
For God's sake, please.

156
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:54,080
- There's nothing more important than this.
- Can you find my son's body?

157
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,000
If it's the last thing I do.

158
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,220
- I made a grave...
- Bring him home, please.

159
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,760
I just want to bury my son.

160
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,990
- I do love Halloween.
- What's inside of a pumpkin?

161
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,070
See for yourself.

162
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,740
What? You don't like this stuff? I do.
Come on. Get in there.

163
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,250
I'll finish cleaning this out.
You can carve it tomorrow.

164
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,250
There he is again, Mom.

165
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,800
My God. It's every night now.

166
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,050
That dog? Where's it coming from?

167
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,720
Next door. My neighbor's.

168
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,930
Leaves the poor thing
in the yard all day and night.

169
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,470
It's been getting worse. I would talk to her,

170
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,230
but I don't want to start something.

171
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,770
Listen to him, Mom. He's so sad.

172
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,150
I just wish he would shut up
so I could sleep.

173
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,900
Do you want me to talk to her?

174
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,280
No, you don't have to do that.

175
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,280
I insist.

176
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,020
- Hello. I don't think we've met.
- Boyfriend of the blonde next door.

177
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,150
I've seen you around.
I'm just getting in. I'm tired.

178
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:45,030
That's precisely why I'm here.
We can't help but notice your dog cries...

179
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,950
- A lot.
- I know.

180
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,950
My ex moved out and left his dog.

181
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,240
I wish there was something I could do.

182
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,080
You could...

183
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,870
take him inside.

184
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,460
Walter's an outside dog.

185
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,840
- Put Walter inside, Walter's an inside dog.
- He doesn't like being inside.

186
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,550
Did he tell you that?

187
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:12,850
We'd appreciate it if you could find a way
to keep him quiet. The kids are upset.

188
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,520
Maybe that's cos they think
their crackhead father

189
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,060
is gonna come back
and beat their asses again.

190
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,560
You know what works for me?
Earplugs.

191
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,290
I could make things
so much easier for Rita...

192
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,710
but that would be wrong.

193
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,920
I love Halloween.

194
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:53,050
The one time of year
when everyone wears a mask, not just me.

195
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,720
People think it's fun
to pretend you're a monster.

196
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,480
Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not.

197
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,440
Brother, friend, boyfriend,
all part of my costume collection.

198
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,530
Some people might call me a fraud.

199
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,660
Let's see if it will fit.

200
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,500
Boo!

201
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,790
You stabbed me in the back!

202
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,380
I prefer to think of myself
as a master of disguise.

203
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,260
They're so excited.

204
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,430
Sure they are. They get to binge on sugar for
an entire day.

205
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,970
Who wouldn't love that?

206
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,970
What about a costume for you?
Maybe this one?

207
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:42,640
No. I think I'll be Snow White again.
It's kind of tradition.

208
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,900
Dexter, look. I'm a princess, too.

209
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,690
Just like your Mom,
two perfect princesses.

210
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:56,200
- Let me guess. You're gonna be a dwarf.
- No. I want to be Joe from Blue's Clues.

211
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,790
I keep telling him that a rugby shirt
is not a costume.

212
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,760
Another photo from my family album.

213
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,970
He's recreating my past
with Tony Tucci's body parts.

214
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,300
He's forcing me to see this.

215
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,680
Nobody paying you to stand around
and goddamn stare.

216
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,100
I thought Angel was working this case,
Sergeant.

217
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,770
Sergeant?

218
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,030
Friends of yours?

219
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,450
Don't worry about it. Worry about this.

220
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,240
The foot was severed between
the tarsus and the metatarsus.

221
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,370
The wound is circular,
again, almost surgical.

222
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,750
And there's blood.

223
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,540
Guy gives us body after body with no blood.
Why he's making a switch now?

224
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,210
He's trying to send a message,

225
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:54,970
one that's more important than his ritual need
to drain the blood and wrap the parts.

226
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,050
OK, so what's the message?

227
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,720
I'm not sure.

228
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,600
Well, who's he sending it to?

229
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,060
I can't tell you that, either.

230
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,400
What fucking good are you?

231
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,400
No fucking good at all, apparently.

232
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,740
- You OK?
- He's mocking me.

233
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,040
Don't take it personally.
Doakes hates all you lab geeks.

234
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,210
Who?

235
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,420
- Relax, bro.
- Sorry.

236
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,540
I need to bag this photo.
It's under the ball. Do you mind?

237
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,690
He knows.

238
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,070
He's not corrupting the happy
hallmark images of my youth.

239
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,320
He's revealing the ugly truth behind them.

240
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,240
Come on, Simon.

241
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,790
You want it? It's right there.

242
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,660
Over there. Oh, yeah.

243
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,790
- Guys, give it back!
- Pass it over here.

244
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,290
You guys, give it back.

245
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,290
Come on, Simon.
What you gonna do?

246
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,880
All right. Enough.

247
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,510
Get out of here.

248
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,220
- What the hell is going on?
- We're just having fun.

249
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,060
It didn't look like Simon
was having too much fun to me.

250
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,270
You're always telling me to fit in,
I'm just trying to be part of the team.

251
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,650
You can't be a bully, Dexter.

252
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,570
First of all, it's wrong.

253
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,070
Secondly, people remember bullies.

254
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,070
People like me, cops.

255
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,790
A bully is a felony waiting to happen.

256
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,620
So?

257
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,660
Blend in.

258
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,920
Go on.

259
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,010
Officer Morgan,
I have an assignment for you.

260
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:09,020
I heard we found a foot this morning.
You want me to head to the crime scene?

261
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,690
No.

262
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,270
Look, we pulled these
from security cameras

263
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,230
around the beach, stores, hotels, ATMs.

264
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,530
- I want you to check every frame.
- You are shitting me.

265
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,410
If we're lucky, we can see the killer
coming and going.

266
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,570
We have techs who can do this.

267
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,990
Not all techs have the skill
to spot suspicious activity.

268
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,710
I'm taking a huge leap of faith that you do.

269
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,210
Keep your eye out for another box
of surveillance tapes.

270
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,000
It's on its way from the new crime scene.

271
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:02,650
Hey, Doakesy, what's up?
Fuck anyone's wife lately?

272
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,500
Thanks to your little stunt, Guerrero's guys are
tailing me everywhere I go.

273
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,130
That's not good, James.
You should alert the police.

274
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,550
Unless, of course, for some reason
the officers of Miami wouldn't help you,

275
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,720
like, you know,
you fucked one of their wives.

276
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,600
You think this is a joke. I'm gonna
end up dead. It's just a matter of when.

277
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,600
You should have thought of that
before you stuck your dick in my sister.

278
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,770
You're right. I should have waited
until the divorce came through.

279
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,110
Bullshit.

280
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,910
What? She didn't tell you?
She filed the papers, jackass.

281
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,700
Ask the captain. He tried to pull Ricky
out of his assignment,

282
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,450
- but Ricky didn't want to come out.
- Of course not.

283
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,580
- His job was to bring down Guerrero.
- It was his job to protect his wife.

284
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:03,130
Ricky's the motherfucker who got her killed.
You backed the wrong cop, asshole.

285
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,720
Let's go, guys. Time for school.

286
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:17,440
Guys? Come on. You don't want to be
in the Halloween parade?

287
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,820
Shut up!

288
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,820
Shut up! Just...

289
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,500
- I need to talk to you about your dog.
- I talked to your boyfriend.

290
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,620
My kids are exhausted.

291
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,590
When it comes to my kids,
I stop being nice.

292
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,380
So I need you to bring him in at night,

293
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,470
feed him on a schedule
and take him for some exercise...

294
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,260
I'm sorry. Is this funny?

295
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,850
No, no, no. It's... It's sad.

296
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,020
But you're funny. Look at you, all tough.

297
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:04,730
- I'm gonna call the police. I can do that.
- There's nothing you can do.

298
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,030
The cops will tell me to keep him quiet,
I'll say I will, and then they'll leave,

299
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,160
and he'll go back to doing what he does.

300
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,990
But you're funny.

301
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:48,650
Unlike Harry, my new friend
doesn't place much value in blending in.

302
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,910
He wants me to see who he is
and what he does.

303
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,700
Everything about him is brazen, authentic.

304
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,120
What does that make me?

305
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,710
Crap.

306
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,050
- You OK, man?
- No.

307
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,430
Don't let this bastard get to you.
You're the best blood expert in the state.

308
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,270
And we need you to stay with this.

309
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,480
I'll be all right.

310
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,520
Wait. Before you get back to work,
check this out.

311
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,110
What is that, a butterfly?

312
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,780
No, socio,
it's a diamond-studded four-leaf clover.

313
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,450
I'm...

314
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,290
I'm giving it to Nina for our anniversary
tomorrow night.

315
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,960
Oh, congratulations.
How many years?

316
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,500
Ten years she's been
my lucky charm now.

317
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:50,130
Tin is the traditional gift,
but I didn't think she'd want a tin clover.

318
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,970
No. It's probably a good plan.

319
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,470
Are you sure that's not a butterfly?

320
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,640
Well, it does kind of look like a bug.

321
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,610
This can't be right.

322
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,400
- What's up?
- You see that?

323
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,650
- You see it?
- I don't know. What do I see?

324
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,570
The blood in the hand suggested the heart was
still pumping when it was severed.

325
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,490
Mean son of a bitch, no doubt.

326
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,370
But look at the foot, it's the same blood flow,
plus the lividity.

327
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,250
Look, it's the same bruising,
same ashen color,

328
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,340
the same level of decomposition
as the hand the day we found it.

329
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,670
But...

330
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,220
- We found them a day apart.
- I know.

331
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,510
Here's a picture. Hollywood.

332
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,310
LT, you got to listen to him.

333
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:46,060
It's the guard, Tucci, I think he's alive.

334
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,190
What are you talking about?

335
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,690
The ice-truck killer is keeping him alive
to perform amputations.

336
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,240
Tucci's alive?

337
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,820
Both limbs were taken from a live body,

338
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:59,120
and we found them 24 hours apart.

339
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,200
That's not all. Tell them, Dexter.

340
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,250
If the hand came off yesterday at seven am,
and the foot this morning at seven...

341
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:09,170
- We get another body part tomorrow.
- But he's alive.

342
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,590
Put together a task force.
I want all available personnel on this.

343
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,260
And put a priority status on all forensics related
to this case.

344
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,340
Captain Matthews, please.

345
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,470
Have him call me back immediately.

346
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,250
Mrs. Tucci?

347
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,040
Maria LaGuerta.

348
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,380
I have some amazing news for you.

349
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,220
We believe your son is alive.

350
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,680
No. No. We haven't,
but I promise we will.

351
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,060
No, thank you.

352
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,560
Yes. Yes.

353
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,400
OK, we'll be in touch. Bye.

354
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,660
We've got a live body now, people.

355
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,990
We want to find Tucci
while he's still breathing.

356
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,210
That means figuring out where tomorrow's drop
is so we catch our man in the act.

357
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,370
Any ideas?

358
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,670
Don't forget the photos. They're new.

359
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,090
Thank you, Officer Morgan.
We're doing just fine out here.

360
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,930
Why do we think he's taking photos?

361
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,510
He wants to be remembered.

362
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,800
You use photos to record memories.

363
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,770
I almost feel sorry for them,
trying to put together a puzzle

364
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:52,110
when they don't know pieces are missing from
the box, pieces he gave me.

365
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,450
He wants me to play the game his way.

366
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,490
OK, what else could it be?

367
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,160
Change.

368
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,500
- You got something to say, speak.
- The beach changed names.

369
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,670
The office park used to be a soccer field.

370
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:18,760
He's dumping the body parts in places
that used to be something else.

371
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,840
OK. Places that have changed.

372
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:24,600
Let's make a list, assign surveillance
to each location for the morning.

373
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,890
South Beach used to be
a mangrove swamp.

374
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,020
Homestead Park was originally
an air force base, right?

375
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,020
They turned Versace's mansion into a hotel.

376
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,730
Thank you, Officer Morgan.

377
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,440
The whole city reinvents itself
every five years.

378
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:42,030
Then we'll stay up all night
until our list is complete.

379
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,850
Lieutenant.

380
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,190
Anything?

381
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,200
Well, I am so glad you could make it.

382
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,040
Well, I just came by to show my support.

383
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,790
It's been a long time
since I've been to church.

384
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,170
Excuse me, everyone.
Excuse me.

385
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,250
I would like to introduce you

386
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,010
- to someone very special.
- No.

387
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:47,100
This is Maria LaGuerta.
She's the policewoman looking for Tony.

388
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,270
Not just me.

389
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,560
Actually, a lot of us.
There's a lot of us looking.

390
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:59,270
You brought us all here together
by giving us hope.

391
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:08,910
May the Lord bless you
and guide you, Maria.

392
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,160
This is Saint Anthony, patron saint of...

393
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,170
The lost.

394
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,960
Find him.

395
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,050
OK.

396
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,140
I tried to apologize,
but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

397
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,760
And you wanted to apologize why?

398
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,350
You don't think I should,
the way I went after her son?

399
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,480
Yeah, you did fuck that up.

400
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,980
Yeah. I crucified him
without having all the facts.

401
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,230
I need to tell her that I'm sorry.

402
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,860
I need to let her know that I'm sorry.
I need to tell her.

403
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,950
Who is that gonna make
feel better, you or her?

404
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,660
Leave that woman alone
with her candles and Kumbaya.

405
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,000
So, where we at?

406
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:05,840
I added additional patrols
at Dolphin Stadium,

407
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,220
Bayside marketplace,
and Casa Casuarina.

408
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,600
That's everybody we have out in the field.

409
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,310
Homicide, robbery, off-duty patrol.
So what's next?

410
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,560
What's next is you should go home.
You've had the shit kicked out of you all day.

411
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:23,070
I like it here with you. You're the only person
people hate more than me.

412
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,570
Fuck you.

413
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,990
Come on. Let's both get out of here.
Nothing left but the waiting now, anyway.

414
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,170
Officer Morgan.

415
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,220
Call me on my cellphone
if you find anything.

416
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,230
Son of a bitch.

417
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,740
Fuck this.

418
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,500
What? Want a piece of me?

419
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,250
Fucking asshole!

420
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,920
I will pay you $1 million

421
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:34,100
if you help me figure out where
the next piece of Tucci's gonna show up.

422
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:38,270
I'm afraid I'm lost on this one, Deb.
It's like it's staring me right in the face, but...

423
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,940
- $1 million.
- You don't have $1 million.

424
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,310
I'll steal it from Evidence.

425
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,690
I've been stuck
in a goddamn fishbowl all day.

426
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,820
I want to be part of the hunt.
I'm almost off duty.

427
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,860
Sorry, sister.

428
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,410
$2 million.

429
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,160
I know you made a list of locations.

430
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,540
Just pick your favorite spot.
We'll stake it out together.

431
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,870
My favorite spot. Of course.

432
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,630
Come on. I want to play.

433
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,760
Deb, I got to go.
We'll compare notes tomorrow, OK?

434
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:24,980
I used to love this place, the bulldozers
pressing garbage, layer after layer,

435
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,610
right into the earth itself, burying it, hiding it.

436
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,610
I found it soothing.

437
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,740
But it wasn't condos back then.

438
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,160
This has to be the right place.

439
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,130
So what am I missing?

440
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,660
Sorry about that.

441
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,460
Go back to sleep.

442
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,590
- Hello.
- Mr. Morgan. Dispatch.

443
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,090
You've been called to the McCaffrey pumpkin
patch. Need the address?

444
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,220
No, I know exactly where it is.

445
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:45,770
Are you OK?

446
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:48,060
Are you kidding? That was awesome.

447
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:50,860
You've got some hay in your hair.

448
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,110
- Where?
- Right there!

449
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:57,450
OK, OK, OK, OK.
Enough. Enough, you two. Come on.

450
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:00,570
Let me take a picture of you and the kids.

451
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,290
You'll miss these moments
when they're older.

452
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,040
Thanks.

453
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,710
- It's great to see you having a good time.
- Are you kidding?

454
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:13,000
This hay's giving me an allergy attack, and
we're going in circles on a pumpkin patch.

455
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,590
Ready?

456
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,880
Smile!

457
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,680
What do we have?

458
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,270
Ankle to knee. He's moving up the leg.

459
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,020
You think Tucci's still alive?

460
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,070
If he is, he won't be for long.

461
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,200
Unless you're toting a portable DVD player,

462
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,740
you better be finished
watching that security footage.

463
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,250
I am on a break. I'm on my own time.

464
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,120
So you are, but your shift
starts in two hours.

465
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,540
So if I were you,
I'd head back to the station.

466
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,750
Traffic at this hour's a bitch.

467
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,380
Speaking of bitch...

468
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:02,300
Didn't Dad bring us here once
when we were kids?

469
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,470
I don't remember.

470
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,220
Hey, Dexter, come here.
Take a look at this.

471
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,930
Excuse us.

472
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,230
She's right, you know, about the traffic.

473
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,320
There's no sign of infection
where the foot was cut off,

474
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,660
like he gave Tucci prophylactic antibiotics
before amputating.

475
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:25,530
At least he's looking after his patient.

476
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,370
Hey, check this out.

477
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,290
Is this appropriate?

478
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,130
It's our anniversary.
And it's the big one.

479
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,470
Nina deserves the best.

480
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,010
"Ox"?

481
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,560
No.

482
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,140
Fuck!

483
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:51,100
What's the matter with you?
It's Xs and Os.

484
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,350
Like tic-tac-toe?

485
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,190
No, like hugs and kisses.

486
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,570
Diamond-filled hugs and kisses
in a white-gold setting.

487
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:06,200
That's good. You wouldn't want it to look like
someone's playing tic-tac-toe on her head.

488
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,540
Goddamn it.

489
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,090
- Where's Mom?
- She had to run a few errands

490
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,420
before she takes you two trick-or-treating.

491
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,010
But I'm too tired to go trick-or-treating.

492
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,220
I heard you two were up a lot last night.

493
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,180
It was that damn dog.

494
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,140
Hey, Code, grown-up language
is for grown-ups.

495
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,310
I don't think that dog will bother you anymore.

496
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,980
How do you know?

497
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,650
My mystic powers told me.

498
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,570
I heard Lindsay Lohan say damn.

499
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:43,070
All right, tell you what,
I'll make you a deal.

500
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,950
When you become a rock star,
you can swear, too.

501
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,620
Walter! Walter!

502
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,370
You're right. He's gone.

503
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,710
Where's my dog? What did you do with it?

504
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,770
All right. Here he is.

505
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,360
Just remember to walk him,
feed him, and love him,

506
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,780
OK?

507
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,570
My nieces are shy sometimes.
Girls, say thank you to Rita.

508
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,370
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

509
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,490
They already made a doggy bed,
sweaters, towels.

510
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,410
It actually looks more comfortable
than my bed.

511
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,250
I knew this would be a perfect fit.

512
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,380
You did a good thing, Rita. Thank you.

513
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,800
Harry was the only one who saw me,

514
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,930
really saw me,

515
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,810
so he taught me to hide.

516
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,270
And that's what's kept me safe.

517
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,230
But sometimes, I'm not sure
where Harry's vision of me ends

518
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,020
and the real me starts.

519
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,990
If I'm just a collection
of learned behaviors,

520
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,990
bits and pieces of Harry,
maybe my new friend is right,

521
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,950
maybe I am a fraud.

522
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,840
Hi.

523
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,800
Hey.

524
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,390
Where's Astor and Cody?

525
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,150
They're passed out
in a sugar coma at Colleen's.

526
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,190
Can I come in?

527
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,820
Oh, yeah, sure. Sorry.

528
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,870
I should warn you,
I haven't really been myself lately.

529
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,170
Well, maybe I can cheer you up.

530
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,010
Trick or treat.

531
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,350
You look great.

532
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,480
Who are you?

533
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,480
Lara Croft.

534
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,690
Tomb Raider.

535
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,910
You raid tombs dressed like that?

536
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,870
That's impressive.

537
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,750
- What happened to Snow White?
- Well, I'm...

538
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,790
I'm sick of her.

539
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,500
You know, I never did
get to thank you

540
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,050
for picking the kids up for me.

541
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,130
You took care of your "errand"?

542
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,430
Yes.

543
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,140
The beagle has landed happily
in the arms of two loving girls.

544
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,560
You are a superhero.

545
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:10,440
It was such an incredible feeling
rescuing that dog.

546
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,030
You upset your neighbor.

547
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,120
Fuck her.

548
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,620
Well, I guess you're used to dealing with
people like her, right?

549
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,380
Considerably worse.

550
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:29,340
Is that why you haven't been yourself lately?

551
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,300
There's a case
I just can't seem to get out of my mind.

552
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,640
Well...

553
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,010
Maybe I can help.

554
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:43,890
No. I'm afraid
there's nothing you can do.

555
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,860
Oh, I don't know.

556
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,860
I'm a dognapper now...

557
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,570
And a tomb raider.

558
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:53,860
There's all sorts of things I can do.

559
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,500
What... What are you doing?

560
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,510
Whatever I want.

561
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,010
I've come to appreciate

562
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,810
the comfortable moments with Rita,
the easy, quiet moments.

563
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,600
This...

564
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,860
might be better.

565
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,940
Look, there's Mr. Tub-of-Lardy
bringing Mrs. Tub-of-Lardy

566
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,990
another bucket of fried chicken.

567
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:46,210
- Where's your brother?
- I'm not his keeper.

568
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,130
What do you think of this?

569
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:56,090
It's an anniversary present for Nina.

570
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,640
See, it's a diamond key to my heart.

571
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:04,220
It's a key, but, you see,
it's shaped like a heart.

572
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:10,060
You can't tell me it looks like anything else, cos
that's what it is. That's what I like.

573
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:12,230
And I'm not gonna take it back.

574
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,400
It's perfect, Angel. She'll love it.

575
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,740
Really?

576
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,700
I would.

577
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,160
How do I look?

578
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:29,120
Like the tie?

579
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,050
Angel.

580
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,600
Happy anniversary, baby.

581
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,430
You know you can't just walk in here
anymore.

582
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,360
I just thought...

583
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,740
Our anniversary...

584
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:04,160
Maybe tonight we could put all that
behind us.

585
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,750
It doesn't matter what night it is.

586
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:09,580
I told you I need time.

587
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,710
It's been three months, baby.

588
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,460
How much time do you need?

589
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,130
Don't turn this around on me, Angel,

590
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,930
not after what you did.

591
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,100
I need as much time as I need.

592
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:42,240
As long as you're here,
you want to see Aury?

593
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,380
Thank you.

594
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,600
That was...

595
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,150
unexpected.

596
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,690
Yeah. For me, too.

597
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:09,660
I have no problem with...

598
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,040
unexpected.

599
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,580
No, you certainly don't.

600
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,340
I have to get back to the kids.

601
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:32,720
Hey, what are these?

602
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,060
I've been reorganizing my photos a little.

603
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:44,610
Look how cute you are.

604
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,030
And your dad, such a nice face,

605
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,660
just like you.

606
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,120
I was adopted.

607
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,200
I know.

608
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,960
But you're both good men.

609
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,080
I can tell.

610
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:04,800
Very poetic.

611
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,510
Poetic? It's a water fountain.

612
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:12,390
Yeah, but look at the way
your dad took the photo.

613
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:17,020
His shadow's on the wall right next to you.
It's like he's always with you.

614
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,770
I'd frame this one.

615
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,650
All this time the answer was right here.

616
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,150
Harry, photographer
and foster father extraordinaire.

617
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,490
He is always with me,

618
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,740
and he's the common denominator.

619
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,160
You're a genius.

620
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:42,750
All those years of smiling for the camera,
it was empty and fake,

621
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,920
the pictures meaningless.

622
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:46,550
Until now.

623
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:48,970
Pictures of Harry.

624
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,690
So...

625
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,530
This is it.

626
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,660
It's cool.

627
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,450
Cool.

628
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,750
Dexter, this is the place
where my father,

629
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:19,580
your grandfather,
worked for 30 years.

630
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,540
He started out as a janitor,

631
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:25,000
worked his way up
to chief of maintenance.

632
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:27,090
This place put food on our table.

633
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:31,470
- In two weeks, it'll all be shut down.
- I know.

634
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:34,760
Excuse me, miss! Miss?
Would you mind?

635
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:37,060
Oh, come on, Dad. I don't want to...

636
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,900
Hey, you all right?

637
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:46,070
It's nothing. Bad medianoches for lunch.
I'm OK.

638
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:50,280
I'm sorry, miss. It's OK. Thanks.
We're not gonna be needing a picture, after all.

639
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,530
Yeah, we are.

640
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,700
- I really don't feel like doing this now.
- Don't be a baby.

641
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:59,040
Being part of a family
means smiling for family photos, right?

642
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,590
My friend left this.

643
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,970
He's showing me where to go.

644
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:21,230
Am I going because it's what he wants
or because that's what Harry would want?

645
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,440
And what do I want?

646
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:56,300
Hospital's shut down now,
abandoned for years,

647
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:59,100
but tonight it's visiting hours again.

648
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,630
Well, James...

649
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,890
Why did you have to be
such a pain in the ass?

650
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,650
- Fuck!
- I didn't tell you you could get up.

651
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,210
Please, please.

652
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:13,380
Now you get up.

653
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:23,640
You traumatize my little girl in church.

654
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,350
Break the knees of my best turner.

655
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:33,150
You're a wild dog, Sergeant.

656
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:38,240
The only thing to do with a wild dog...

657
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:41,660
Police! Hands in the air!

658
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,170
Thought you could use backup.

659
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:51,580
You could have filled me in, man. Shit.

660
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,670
Got you going after a goddamn cop,
motherfucker.

661
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,550
We own your ass now.

662
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:06,890
So this was the plan all along,
to use me as bait to bring down Guerrero?

663
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:11,230
Yeah, and now my sister
can rest in peace.

664
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:14,110
We're done now, Doakes. We're even.

665
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:16,940
- Fuck!
- I'll call this in, bring the paramedics.

666
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:20,410
Get this piece of shit out of here.

667
00:51:57,610 --> 00:51:58,610
Please.

668
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,620
Just do it.

669
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:08,750
Kill me.

670
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,710
I'm ready.

671
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:18,630
I'm ready.

672
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,220
Just don't cut me anymore.

673
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:32,440
Please don't cut me anymore.

674
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,400
Gift-wrapped and begging for death.

675
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,690
Tools at the ready.

676
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,190
Just kill me. It's OK.

677
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,110
He was left here so I would kill him,

678
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,410
but my new friend doesn't see me
as clearly as he thinks.

679
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,580
I can't kill this man.

680
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,500
Harry wouldn't want it.
And neither would I.

681
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:17,360
- Are you Morgan?
- Message came through dispatch for you.

682
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,400
Who left this?

683
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:28,370
Who left it?

684
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,090
Oh, Jesus, stop that. I'm getting bruises.

685
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:42,090
I'm sorry. I'm so excited.

686
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:44,220
Try a hug once in a while.

687
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,470
I don't know who your contacts are, Morgan,
but you are my up-and-comer.

688
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,220
You saved a man's life tonight.

689
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:57,270
- I'm just the one who got the call, sir.
- But you followed it up.

690
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,440
- Right place at the right time, sir.
- Where we at?

691
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:04,030
Morgan's tip was good.
They're taking Tucci over to County.

692
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:05,320
Alive?

693
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,280
Alive.

694
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:17,790
So, I suppose this gets Deb off
of surveillance-tape duty.

695
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,920
Really? Is that what you suppose?

696
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,750
I got your page, Lieutenant.

697
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,090
Doakes is caught up
in the Guerrero bust.

698
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,970
- You're taking point.
- You got it.

699
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:29,010
I'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow.
I want forensic evidence.

700
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:33,470
I don't care if you have to tear apart
this building brick by brick.

701
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:36,270
Use Morgan here.

702
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:43,940
How did your wife like that necklace, Angel?

703
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:47,780
You were right. She loved it.
You nailed that one.

704
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:16,470
Everyone hides who they are
at least some of the time.

705
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:23,400
Sometimes you bury
that part of yourself so deeply

706
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,480
that you have to be reminded
it's there at all.

707
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,250
Good work, man.
I told you we'd get that son of a bitch...

708
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,920
And sometimes you just want to forget
who you are altogether.

709
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:03,190
And what about me?

710
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:06,610
Maybe I'll never be the human
Harry wanted me to be...

711
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,690
but I couldn't kill Tony Tucci.

712
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,110
That's not me, either.

713
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,620
My new friend thought I wouldn't be able
to resist the kill he left for me,

714
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,750
but I did.

715
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:31,550
I'm not the monster he wants me to be.

716
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,890
So I'm neither man nor beast.

717
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,270
I'm something new entirely,

718
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:41,060
with my own set of rules.

719
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,110
I'm Dexter.

720
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:55,407
Boo.
