00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,906
Next time, amigo,

3
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,159
plan ahead.

4
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,998
Oh, I'm such a bad Catholic.

5
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,078
Where's my girl, fool?

6
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:08,538
She cool, man. She in there.
She's still fine as hell.

7
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,374
So that's it?
Bada-bing, you out of the game?

8
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,822
Done with the whole trade?

9
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:13,335
- Yeah.
- Well, that's the problem, Bosco.

10
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,711
You either keep doin' that,

11
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,588
or you do a 15-year bid
in a Mexican prison

12
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,632
with Cheeto's cousin in there.

13
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,969
Same old shit. You choose
how to flush the toilet, brother.

14
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,762
That's right. Easy way
or the hard way.

15
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,829
Come on!

16
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,669
Okay, street soldier. Shit.

17
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,214
But watch yourself, B.A., now,
you gonna lose your oldest friend here.

18
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:08,056
What's up, girl?
You miss me?

19
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:12,394
Because I missed you. Yes, I did.
It's been too long, baby.

20
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,312
Way too long.

21
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,988
Heck of a place.

22
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,906
Just a heck of
a beautiful place.

23
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,743
Is this a time-share?
I'd love to get in on this.

24
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,866
I like this whole Santa Fe motif
you got going here, Tuco.

25
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:34,583
Very Arizona, very Tex-Mex.
It's good. It's good.

26
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,126
Maybe we can get
the guy at my six

27
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,462
to whip up a couple
of quesadiches, you know?

28
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,808
- Army Intelligence.
- Who's that?

29
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,351
- You, man.
- No.

30
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,729
You're not so intelligent
because you're stuck in some tires.

31
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,272
I'm happy. I'm happy.

32
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,108
Doesn't get any better
than this, right?

33
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,777
- I'm livin' the dream.
- You are!

34
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,405
You're gonna come here...

35
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,747
Well, first of all,
she's so hot,

36
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:16,875
and, uh, we both hate you.
So that's just sort of how it...

37
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,129
Good morning!
Good morning, man!

38
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,923
Now it's a party!

39
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,426
- Is that your best shot?
- Now it's a party, man!

40
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,837
Whoa!

41
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,516
Oh, hell, no.

42
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,643
Slide over... slowly.

43
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,603
You jacking me?

44
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,730
What is this, opposite day?

45
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,860
I'm not a thief. But if I don't reach
my friend in time, then he dies.

46
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,655
If you ain't a thief,
I guarantee you ain't a killer.

47
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,869
Take your left hand off the wheel
and your right hand off the shifter, now.

48
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,371
You ain't gonna
shoot me in the head, pops.

49
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,082
You know that
ain't happening.

50
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,044
What the hell's
wrong with you, man?

51
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,504
You shoot
a total stranger?

52
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,506
I don't even
know you, fool. Damn.

53
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:48,300
Oh, it'll heal, I promise.

54
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,468
- Here, wrap it in this.
- I know how to make a tourniquet, fool.

55
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,179
I know it hurts,
but I had to make a point with you.

56
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,722
That ain't what's
pissin' me off.

57
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,682
You shootin' my van
is what's pissin' me off, man.

58
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,350
What's wrong with you?

59
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,190
You Army Ranger, son?

60
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,860
Be real careful
of what you say next, pops.

61
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,654
Be ready to empty that burner
if you start shit-talking my battalion.

62
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,575
Never shall I fail my comrades.

63
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,954
Gallantly will I show the world
that I am a specially selected soldier.

64
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,958
Energetically will I meet
the enemies of my country.

65
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,379
I shall defeat them on the
field of battle...

66
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,923
for I am better trained.

67
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:32,385
And I will fight...
with all my might.

68
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,229
Colonel Hannibal Smith.
75th Ranger Regiment.

69
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,023
4th Battalion.
Fort Benning, Georgia.

70
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,485
I know who you are, sir.
Corporal B.A. Baracus.

71
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,863
I mean, it was till I was dishonorably
discharged for some bullshit.

72
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,202
I don't subscribe
to coincidence, corporal.

73
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,205
I believe that, no matter
how random things might appear,

74
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,414
there's still a plan.

75
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,257
That here in the middle
of the Mexican desert,

76
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,092
when I needed the most,

77
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,969
I'd find a fellow Ranger.

78
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:17,973
Boy.

79
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,975
Now, I need your help
to save another.

80
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,270
<i>Bad news for you today!</i>

81
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,940
This rescue that's coming,
we fed him to the Rottweilers

82
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,108
- about an hour ago.
- You know what's funny?

83
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,902
Is that you actually believe
that you got me.

84
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,821
<i>You actually think
you're gonna kill me.</i>

85
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,155
Can you drive?

86
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,491
Better than anybody
you've ever seen, sir.

87
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,627
<i>In a few minutes
I'm gonna be having a cold beer,</i>

88
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,506
and you are gonna be on fire.
Take care, my friend.

89
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,885
- Alpha, Mike...
- No!

90
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,638
<i>Foxtrot.</i>

91
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,600
Think about it.

92
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,399
Adios, mother...

93
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,999
Hannibal!

94
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,794
What are you doin'?

95
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,218
Get in!

96
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:39,721
B.A., move.

97
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,403
This is bullshit!

98
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,908
Ahora, muerto!

99
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,411
Stop it! Please stop!

100
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,206
Please stop! Stop it!
Stop! Please stop!

101
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,088
How's your day goin'?

102
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,840
This is not gonna taste good.

103
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,769
Oh, baby, I just threw up.

104
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,397
Let me get some gum.
Let me just get some gum.

105
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,774
Did you see that?
Did you see Tuco's face?

106
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,943
Oh, when you came over,
that was unbelievable!

107
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,528
- How many times did I say it?
- The timing was perfect.

108
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,197
- How many times did I say it, Face?
- It was so beautiful.

109
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,574
- I told you not to take down Tuco alone.
- What?

110
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,159
Well, you...

111
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,786
You know what? I'm sorry.

112
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,873
I'm sorry I didn't have the... the-the
Hannibal Smith How-To Manual.

113
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,876
- Okay? I had to move.
- That move snowballs, Face.

114
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,837
You almost
got yourself killed.

115
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,172
Which almost got me killed
and almost got him killed.

116
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,633
Five-year-old.

117
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,720
Well, you look like you got
a real bad attitude.

118
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,222
What?

119
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,974
Did I shoot up your van?

120
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,060
Am I wearin'
your favorite shirt?

121
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,186
This is your favorite shirt?

122
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,814
Yeah, pretty boy,
that's my favorite shirt.

123
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,191
Did you get shot for me, too?

124
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,735
- And carjacked.
- By me.

125
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,574
Wait,
and he still got you to drive?

126
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,292
Thank you. Peck.

127
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,669
Baracus. It's all good,
you know.

128
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,714
See, Face, this is what happens
when we forget about plans

129
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,215
and just fire blind.

130
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,300
Oh, I'm sorry.

131
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,344
I'm so sorry that
I have feelings for a human being.

132
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,263
- That I fell in love.
- Love?

133
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,975
Wait a minute. What about
Miss... Croatia three weeks ago?

134
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,521
Rescue sex.

135
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,733
I was tryin' to save her.

136
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:57,942
- Save her?
- Yeah.

137
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,110
Save her? How?

138
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,489
Please, do share with us
your plan, Face.

139
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,700
Okay, I hadn't thought about that yet.

140
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,494
Exactly. I had to.

141
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,121
Her plane ticket.

142
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,874
Her work visa and
her new passport.

143
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,293
And don't bullshit me
that this was about her, Face.

144
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,462
This was all about Tuco.

145
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,380
Have a mag?

146
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,078
- Mike.
- Boss man. How the hell are you?

147
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,038
- Still chewing the same dirt?
- I am, unfortunately.

148
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,831
- And out here in lovely Mexico.
- Good.

149
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,293
- So what have you got for me?
- Well, I got a fast bird doing pizza runs.

150
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,629
- The call sign is "Hatchet".
- Hatchet. Okay.

151
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,673
And that is whatever
you want it to be.

152
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,799
This is yours.

153
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,552
General, may I remind you,
they don't take to the gringos.

154
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,011
I owe you one, okay?

155
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,514
- Let's not wait till Bragg again, huh?
- Three years.

156
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,887
- And the kid. Still you and the chicks.
- B.A.

157
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:14,587
What?

158
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,063
How am I gonna just leave my girl
like this, after all that?

159
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,481
I had to fight
to get her back.

160
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,567
Leave the keys and
we'll come back for her. Come on.

161
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,111
Looking shabby.

162
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,532
- What is the deal, brother?
- Shoot anything that moves, okay?

163
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,659
- This is worse than Colombia.
- I know Tuco, man.

164
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,287
Don't worry about it. I'll take her
to war college in Saint Tropez.

165
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,913
I'll get you all their numbers,
so don't worry about it.

166
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,315
- Face.
- Yeah.

167
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:37,431
- Look after the corporal.
- Okay.

168
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:39,377
And you're covered in gas,
which I think is interesting.

169
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,559
Find a treatment room,
corporal.

170
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,020
Make it quick.
I'm gonna find our pilot.

171
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,443
Hey.

172
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,992
Hey, doc, you got a second
for a wounded vet?

173
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,872
Highly decorated
combat pilot.

174
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,541
You ask him, he thinks
he's the best in the world.

175
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,627
But he's
a functioning lunatic.

176
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,842
Last week he tried to escape
by jump-starting an ambulance.

177
00:15:23,842 --> 00:15:24,664
Clear.

178
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,507
Damn it!

179
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,259
My kinda guy.

180
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,348
It almost hit
your tattoo there.

181
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,932
Has anyone seen Mr. Murdock?

182
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,769
The old Ranger tat.
Mr. Murdock?

183
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,481
Would you think I was crazy
if I told you I had one o' these?

184
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,524
Something wrong
with your eyes, man.

185
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,194
- Mr. Murdock?
- Not while I'm operating, nurse.

186
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,071
- Not now.
- Why are you off the ward?

187
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,448
Is that gas? Is that you?

188
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,617
- I smell gas.
- What do you mean, "ward"?

189
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,035
- What ward?
- This man is a patient here.

190
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,912
Is this you?
Don't listen to her, she's crazy.

191
00:15:55,996 --> 00:16:00,124
Honestly, I'm... I'm a practising doctor
at Johns Hopkins University.

192
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,752
- You asked him to do a lightning bolt?
- I asked for no lightnin' bolt.

193
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,837
- I'm calling security.
- What's wrong with this fool?

194
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,381
- Is he crazy?
- It is you.

195
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,091
- You on fire, man.
- What? What's that?

196
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,801
- What the...
- Oh, Jesus!

197
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:12,178
- You Rangers. I like you!
- Are you crazy?

198
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,646
Hey! Hey, come on!

199
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,483
Corporal, off. Back off!

200
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,068
This is a hospital.

201
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:30,279
- Everybody's met Mr. Murdock.
- Met him?

202
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,823
He lit my arm on fire.

203
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,075
He stitched a lightnin' bolt
in mine, man.

204
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,160
Look at me, son.

205
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,747
I'm told you're
a hell of a chopper pilot.

206
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:40,998
The best, sir.

207
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,458
I'm not gettin' on a chopper
with this nut job.

208
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,585
Yeah, that's a good... You know...
What's he, another one of your projects?

209
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,755
I'm a real soldier.
I'm a Ranger, baby.

210
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,549
I'm worried!

211
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,926
I'm a Ranger, sir.

212
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,678
That's good enough for me.

213
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,138
You've been released
into our care

214
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,181
- and reinstated, captain.
- I'm not even close to good with that.

215
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,766
Thank you, sir.

216
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,476
Let's get the hell outta here.

217
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,198
You gorgeous
old rust bucket, you.

218
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,658
Did you miss your daddy?

219
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:18,828
Face, what's the most important part
of a well-oiled plan?

220
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,204
To be one step
ahead of the enemy,

221
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,124
- not to be running away from him.
- Who says we're running?

222
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,959
What, we're gonnao go
in this dinosaur,

223
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,252
- with this freak show?
- Yep.

224
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,881
You spin me right round, baby,
right round.

225
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,800
- Rotors are good, sir.
- Who is this guy?

226
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:40,016
Come on! Let's go!

227
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,476
We've got gringos to kill!

228
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,186
Murdock, get this thing
in the air.

229
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,729
Hold on, boys!

230
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,981
I'm gonna try something
I saw in a cartoon once.

231
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,484
What you talkin' about cartoons for?
Get us the hell outta here!

232
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,194
We got a hot chopper
to your six.

233
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:55,740
I'm blocking bullets.
We're bulletproof.

234
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,492
We're bulletproof, boys!

235
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,160
Oh, heads up.

236
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,837
<i>I see you, gringo!</i>

237
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,715
You pancaked my van!
I'm-a kill you, fool!

238
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,884
You can't park there.
That's a handicap zone.

239
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,386
- I knew you was crazy! I knew...
- This is a mistake.

240
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,230
Fire! Fire! Fire!

241
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,404
Blow them out of the sky.

242
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,911
I've never tried this before!

243
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,789
Did you see that?

244
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,041
Did you see
how he turned the helicopter?

245
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,130
Whoa! There's nothing like some good
air-to-air combat, eh, boys?

246
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,674
Don't look at me!
Look there!

247
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,469
He's only got
heat seekers left.

248
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,720
Captain, get us outta here.

249
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,014
Hold on,
this could get ugly!

250
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,600
Here we go!
Come on, baby, climb!

251
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,318
Fire the missiles.

252
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,780
Whoa! Missiles!
Come on, come on.

253
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,950
That's how we deal
with heat seekers, chaps.

254
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,994
We go cold.

255
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,541
What the hell?!

256
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,001
Face, get 'im in here!

257
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,087
Holy, shit! Oh, shit!

258
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,964
Got 'im!

259
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,340
Restart. Restart.

260
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,763
Close the door!

261
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,433
I know you're Airborne Rangers,
but that was ridiculous!

262
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,936
You're gonna be okay.

263
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,899
Boss, the idea is to kill Tuco,
not the other way around!

264
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,777
One step ahead of the game
isn't a plan, kid.

265
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,156
Two to three steps ahead.

266
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,825
Beatin' an enemy's move
before it's even made.

267
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,660
That's a plan.

268
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:07,580
Hatchet, Hatchet,
lock on my LC.

269
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,291
<i>General Tuco,
you are currently engaged</i>

270
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,919
<i>in unauthorized warfare
on United States military personnel.</i>

271
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,464
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You engaged me.

272
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,007
<i>Repeat.</i>

273
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:22,428
<i>You're engaged in unauthorized warfare
on United States military personnel.</i>

274
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,642
Over United States air space.

275
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:31,228
- What?
- Alpha, Mike...

276
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,148
- Foxtrot!
- ... Foxtrot!

277
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,903
<i>- In other words, Adios, mother...
- Oh, no.</i>

278
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,660
Yeah!

279
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,913
Well done, captain.

280
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,790
- That was awesome.
- That wasn't awesome.

281
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,459
- You are a genius!
- I'm never flyin' again in this thing!

282
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,252
I never should
have doubted you, boss!

283
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,922
There's a plan
in everything, kid.

284
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,550
And I love it
when a plan comes together.

285
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,330
Gunpowder cookin'.
Nothing like it.

286
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,460
Face, you want it
napalmed or nuked?

287
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,962
Oh, nuke it.

288
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,548
- Nuke it!
- Mm-hm.

289
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:46,137
Murdock,
burn the hell out of it...

290
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,306
like it was damned.

291
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,475
Burn the whole place down, buddy.

292
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,983
- You want secret sauce?
- No. No, no, no, no, no. None of that anti-freeze.

293
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,819
The secret's out. You crazy.
Everybody knows.

294
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,780
No one can do an anti-freeze
marinade like you can, Murdock.

295
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,992
But... I got a little Bell's palsy
last time I ate something like that.

296
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,494
It's only partial paralysis.
Come on, take it like a man.

297
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,288
Yes, sir. I'm having
that conversation right now.

298
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,248
We will enforce that.
I've got it well in hand, sir.

299
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:17,752
I don't think you want me to be
in the field partially paralyzed, bud.

300
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,337
Visitors.

301
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,345
Yeah.

302
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,686
Wow, I'm a little taken aback.
I'm not gonna lie.

303
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,646
Lieutenant.

304
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,648
I'm sorry, am I supposed
to call you lieutenant back?

305
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,275
No, you're supposed
to call me captain.

306
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,235
Captain. Captain?

307
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,779
That's right.

308
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,573
Captain Crunch.
Look at you. Wow.

309
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:51,452
So, I guess you said... "no" to the kids,
"no" to the family.

310
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,329
Just... no ladder
you can't climb, huh?

311
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:56,332
No, no, honey,
I just said "no" to you.

312
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,211
Hello. My name's Percy.

313
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,671
Would you like some pork?

314
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,216
If I broke every bone in your hand,
could you still do that?

315
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,135
This is crazy. Three years?

316
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,179
We haven't seen each other
for three years,

317
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,389
this is what
we're gonna talk about?

318
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,394
What would you like
to discuss?

319
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,191
Did you take
my Steely Dan CD?

320
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,026
I'm not even gonna
respond to that.

321
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,195
We listened to it,
like, nine times in a row.

322
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,490
We were drinking that... crappy cabernet.
You remember that?

323
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,493
Oh, we were doing somethin' else.
What were we doing?

324
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,579
Do you remember what it was
we were doin'? It wa... it was in a bedroom.

325
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,997
You don't remember?

326
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,583
The only thing
I remember is leaving.

327
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:43,546
Which is...
my fondest memory of you.

328
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,679
You guys are the best.
Stay outta trouble, you hear me?

329
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:55,266
Take care. Yes. Thank you.

330
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,769
Keep that on.

331
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,906
Colonel, my name is Lynch,
I'm with Central Intelligence.

332
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,119
I knew a company man named Lynch
back in the first Desert Storm.

333
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,621
Yeah, I come from
a long line of Lynches.

334
00:24:18,164 --> 00:24:21,667
You ever stop to consider that maybe
the reason nobody trusts the CIA

335
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,878
is because nobody knows
your real names?

336
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:27,172
What can I do for you,
Mr. Lynch?

337
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,675
I need you to help me to stop
Saddam's former flunkies

338
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,428
from stealing over a billion dollars
in the next 30 hours.

339
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,724
Now, the only mint outside of the U.S.
capable of printing our money

340
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,225
belonged to the Shah of Iran.

341
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,311
During the Iran-Iraq war,
it went missing.

342
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,062
Rumor was
Saddam had stolen it.

343
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:44,064
And we stole it back
during Desert Storm.

344
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,442
Well, you didn't get
the engraving plates.

345
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,111
It didn't matter.

346
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:52,489
They would have had to rebuild
a mint just to print those bills.

347
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,074
Well, sir...

348
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,077
it's happening as we speak.

349
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:04,126
Fedayeen thugs have seized
what's left of the Iraqi National Mint

350
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,504
to run off billions of dollars
in unbacked American currency.

351
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,132
How are they planning on
moving the plates and a billion dollars

352
00:25:10,216 --> 00:25:12,468
- out of Baghdad?
- Armored convoy,

353
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:15,095
manned with
former Iraqi spec ops.

354
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,432
You know, high speed,
shoot-to-kill types.

355
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,809
So, how do you plan
on stoppin' them?

356
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:29,568
Listen, there's some rumors
about some top-secret plates

357
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,196
being smuggled out o' the city
by Saddam loyalists.

358
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,281
Do you know
anything about this?

359
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,326
Seriously, if you're gonna make
a play for these plates,

360
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,119
I'm waving you off right now.

361
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:41,664
Cause it's my responsibility
and it's my ass.

362
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,499
I'm serious.

363
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,376
- Face?
- Mm-hm.

364
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,127
I will court-martial you.

365
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,380
- Whoo! Okay.
- Hey.

366
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,924
Get the memo.

367
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:56,345
Tell your beloved colonel Smith
and stay the hell out of Baghdad.

368
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,930
You know...

369
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,475
you never came back. I thought
you were gonna come back.

370
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,852
Well, this is me,
coming back.

371
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,029
You think those clowns
can really pull this off?

372
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,156
Listen, listen,
I would never tell him this,

373
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,326
but they are the best clandestine unit
in the four branches,

374
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,495
and they specialize
in the ridiculous.

375
00:26:22,288 --> 00:26:23,914
Shadow Peck and
the rest of them.

376
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,042
- Do not let them out of your sight.
- Yes, ma'am.

377
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,006
- Doesn't diablo mean "devil"?
- Yeah, man.

378
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,510
Goddamn it, Hannibal,
what do you want me to do?

379
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,762
If this were my operation
and you wanted it,

380
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,974
- you would have the mission.
- You let Black Forest deploy on this,

381
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:44,184
and it's an international incident,
I promise you.

382
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,020
They're not soldiers.

383
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,772
They're frat boys
with trigger fingers.

384
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,525
- Who's runnin' the ground team?
- Brock Pike.

385
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,070
Pike.

386
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,824
He's a thug. He's a cartoon character.
Come on.

387
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:02,870
Hannibal, we have been ordered,
ordered, mind you,

388
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,705
to stay out of Baghdad.

389
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,499
- Cut, dried, the end.
- General.

390
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,794
We should find him
a little wiggle room, don't you think?

391
00:27:11,337 --> 00:27:15,049
You know, I knew another Lynch,
a CIA stooge.

392
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,051
Stationed in Laos, '68.

393
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,471
- No relation.
- Are you sure?

394
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,930
Cause you remind me of 'im.

395
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,185
I'm due in Kabul in a few hours.

396
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:30,314
I'll be back here in 48.
I'm assuming we're green and go.

397
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,232
Notify me otherwise.

398
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,943
He's wearing body armor
in the HQ.

399
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,239
And that should tell you everything
you need to know about the CIA.

400
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,921
Russ, let's do some good
on the way out the door here.

401
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,966
Those plates are gonna do
all kinds of damage.

402
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,510
Let me go get 'em.

403
00:28:00,094 --> 00:28:02,638
Forget about it, Hannibal.
Steer clear of this one.

404
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,097
Well clear of it.

405
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,976
This is a... gauntlet run
right through the heart of Sadr City.

406
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,851
You know, Saddam Hussein
was a certifiable madman,

407
00:28:12,851 --> 00:28:15,192
but... even he wasn't
crazy enough

408
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,445
to go into that place
more than once in 30 years.

409
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,532
We pulled outta there a week ago
and already it's the Wild West.

410
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,659
You actually sound worried.

411
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,496
- And you actually seem offended.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

412
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,665
Well, this isn't about
you losin' a step now.

413
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,083
I want you to know that.

414
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,710
- Hey.
- Hey.

415
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,088
I'm 10 times the man I was
when you met me.

416
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,048
- Uh-huh-huh.
- And twice as fast.

417
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,967
Russ,

418
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:43,637
the boys and I can get this done,
minus the bloodshed.

419
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,181
Those plates can do
all kinds of damage.

420
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,641
Don't make me beg.

421
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:49,560
I'd hate to see you beg,
Hannibal.

422
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:55,065
You've been my friend
for a long time.

423
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,651
More importantly,

424
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,612
you and those boys
have possibly been

425
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:05,117
the most valuable military asset
I've ever had at my disposal.

426
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,912
Now, you asked me
not to make you beg.

427
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,749
Right now, I'm beggin' you.

428
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:16,086
Hannibal, please,
let this one go.

429
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:21,133
Russ, this is too big an enterprise.
We can't let these bozos do this.

430
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,843
It's way too big.

431
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,430
And you'd do it
with or without my blessing?

432
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,515
No, that I wouldn't.

433
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,517
I need your blessing.

434
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,399
I'm not so sure that
it is a blessing, but...

435
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,695
Good hunting, my friend.

436
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,948
Thank you.

437
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,578
How'd it go
with the old man?

438
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,205
Ah, same old, same old.
What you got there?

439
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,999
Pictures of my new baby.

440
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,752
Oh, look at her.
Who's a proud papa?

441
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,796
These pictures are the closest
Murdock gets to that van.

442
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,507
It's ready for me
when I go back to LA.

443
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:06,929
Listen, B.A.,
we're extending our stay a little bit.

444
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,430
We're goin' back
into Baghdad.

445
00:30:08,514 --> 00:30:10,515
I thought we was ordered
to stay outta Baghdad.

446
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,721
- That's true.
- Smith.

447
00:30:11,721 --> 00:30:16,146
- But I'm... Pike.
- I understand you and your grunts

448
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,440
are now stealing my gigs.
I don't like that.

449
00:30:18,524 --> 00:30:21,693
I figured, uh, you Black Forest guys
would be busy...

450
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,947
installing a dictatorship or
overthrowing a democracy somewhere.

451
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,744
It's still the weekend, yet.
That's nine-to-five stuff... pops.

452
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,163
Look at you clowns.

453
00:30:33,247 --> 00:30:34,706
You're not soldiers.

454
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,084
You're... assassins
in polo shirts.

455
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,965
We'll make in a week
what you guys make in a year.

456
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,758
Cash don't buy guts, kid,

457
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,469
or brains.

458
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,680
And you're short on both.

459
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:55,102
This is Morrison's base.
Bug out o' my op.

460
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,565
They make you wear
the yellow shirt there, B.A.?

461
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,776
What's that stand for,
"Barely Able"?

462
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,740
Get out o' my way, punk.

463
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,827
Hey! Don't sweat 'em.

464
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:14,955
They might have just
done us a favor. A big one.

465
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:17,708
Let me see, we got
one medium tank left.

466
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,960
I'm telling you,
there's a reason she came back.

467
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,379
Face, I told you,
forget about 'er.

468
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:23,880
The levels of ambition
on this woman...

469
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,882
I ain't steppin' foot
in any type of aircraft, Hannibal.

470
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,094
No gliders, paper planes,
ultra-lights...

471
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,096
- You ever gonna let me live that down?
- No.

472
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,224
Mexico was a long time ago,
and I saved your life.

473
00:31:34,308 --> 00:31:36,393
How about thankin' me
for not whoopin' your ass at the hospital?

474
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,978
I was an Airborne Ranger
until I met you.

475
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,604
And you chickened out just like...

476
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,107
- 263 jumps.
- Just a thank-you would have been nice.

477
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,276
And one helicopter ride with you
screws it up.

478
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,404
Airborne Ranger with
a fear of flyin'. Like a punk!

479
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,365
B.A., for the last time,
nobody leaves the truck

480
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,535
once we take it over. Okay?

481
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,956
My cousin takes me to this party
where this amazing cover band

482
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,918
does this trash metal version
of "Hello" by, uh, Lionel Richie.

483
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,045
- Yeah.
- Yeah. It goes...

484
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:06,590
Hello, is it me
you're looking for?

485
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,258
Guys, how long
have they been in there?

486
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,343
- About three hours.
- Three hours.

487
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,429
Three hours?

488
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,265
They've been in there for three hours?
They haven't come out at all?

489
00:32:15,349 --> 00:32:16,725
No one came out
to take a leak, nothin'?

490
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,310
- No.
- Nope.

491
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,109
You know, I've been here for three seconds
and that sounds odd to me.

492
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,028
Well, I've been watching
that tent like a hawk.

493
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,198
Really? It looks like you're eatin'
some risotto and sittin' on your ass.

494
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,616
I don't know.
I wanted the soup.

495
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,952
- I wasn't eating risotto. I had...
- It's not risotto.

496
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,544
Yeah, boys.

497
00:32:50,676 --> 00:32:52,636
Yeah, he wants to fight,
doesn't he?

498
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,808
Damn, this is awesome.
They got us a stripper, too.

499
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,727
You got that hot enlisted look.
Me likey.

500
00:33:02,688 --> 00:33:05,565
Before I throw you in the stockade,
where are they?

501
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,193
They didn't tell us,
ma'am... captain.

502
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:12,155
They just gave us a case o' beer
and 50 bucks apiece.

503
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,865
I got a hundred.

504
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,659
Oh, did you get a hundred?

505
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,667
You think we get
to keep the hair?

506
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,586
Staging, movement,
action plan...

507
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,588
There's a nice read for you.

508
00:33:30,056 --> 00:33:33,802
Oh, hell, yeah, Hannibal.
This is it right here.

509
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,888
This is bat-shit insane.

510
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,268
- It's perfect.
- This is beyond nuts, boss.

511
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,567
It gets better.

512
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:52,696
B.A., you'll need a piece
of contoured metal to make a skid plate.

513
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,822
Let's go, fool.

514
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,449
Murdock,
we'll need a car battery, too.

515
00:33:56,576 --> 00:34:00,162
See if the boys at Black Forest
can help us out.

516
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,872
Press credentials,
we need 'em.

517
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,457
Hit the media tent
and see what's lyin' around.

518
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,256
Sorry, my friend,
I see you've put

519
00:34:06,256 --> 00:34:08,587
the, uh, South African microphone
at the bottom.

520
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,797
You can't always put
the CNN on top.

521
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,091
Private, there's two mikes. You gotta
make sure, I don't know, if there is something...

522
00:34:18,764 --> 00:34:22,499
Murdock, we need a news camera.
See what you can do.

523
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,647
Sorry. Oh, sorry. Sorry.

524
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,317
Hello. Uh, I'm, uh...

525
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,319
I'm in love with you.

526
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,945
Listen, we're doin'
a preliminary poll of...

527
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,323
What are we talkin' about?
Of the pull-out.

528
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:40,327
We're gonna need airbags...
lots of them.

529
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,746
- What bureau are you with, darling?
- "Le Monde".

530
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,247
Are you French?

531
00:34:49,518 --> 00:34:51,880
<i>Hello, this is
general Parker. I need...</i>

532
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,048
Okay. It's for you.

533
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,800
Hey, fool, you need to call
an air strike on yourself.

534
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,430
- We're good, mate. I'll meet you.
- No, I think we need to get goin' now.

535
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:03,683
You need to understand
what I'm telling you right now.

536
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:06,269
B.A.,
we're gonna need a magnet.

537
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,355
- Yeah!
- A powerful one.

538
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,693
You ever seen
Blue Man Group?

539
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,197
I'll pick up the rest.

540
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:29,042
I'm just gonna go for it.

541
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,297
Ooh, la, la.

542
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,050
What would you give
for one chance

543
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,720
to come back here
and tell our enemies

544
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,390
that they may take
our lives,

545
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:47,560
but they'll never
take our freedom?!

546
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,569
Ready to go downtown?

547
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,905
Good luck tomorrow.

548
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,324
- Thank you.
- Give 'em hell.

549
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,750
General Morrison,
where the hell is Hannibal Smith?

550
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:17,841
Captain, you would do well
to revise your tone and readdress me.

551
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:21,594
General, I have authority under DCIS
that supersedes your command,

552
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,724
so, last time, before this becomes
embarrassing for the both of us,

553
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,394
where is Hannibal Smith?

554
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,274
Would you excuse us, general?

555
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,367
Captain, in... nearly 40 years
of being in this army,

556
00:36:44,618 --> 00:36:46,786
I have learned
to control my temper

557
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,272
and my voice when in the presence
of a subordinate officer

558
00:36:50,272 --> 00:36:55,295
who, for at least the time being,
seems to have lost her goddamn mind.

559
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,298
Now, it is my understanding

560
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,300
that you have a question for me.
Is that correct?

561
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,885
You are correct, sir.

562
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:06,139
Then when you are prepared to
remember that you are still an officer

563
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:09,893
in the United States Army,
in spite of your civilian attire,

564
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,897
and are ready to present that question
in a military fashion,

565
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,107
then perhaps we could get somewhere
with this discussion.

566
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:20,236
If you have sent an Alpha Team into
Baghdad for any reason whatsoever,

567
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,615
that is a direct violation
of a DoD order.

568
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,368
Well, and as much as you have
this kind of knowledge,

569
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:30,955
I can't help wondering why it is that
you need to ask anything of me.

570
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,877
I will take that as
your confirmation, sir.

571
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,053
They go mobile
in three hours.

572
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,932
The plates and
over a billion dollars

573
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:52,685
will be loaded in the back
of a semi at the mint.

574
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:57,315
They're overland for exactly
4.6 miles before they reach the bridge.

575
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,739
That's our window...
and it closes fast.

576
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,538
These guys will go weapons hot
at the first whisper of trouble.

577
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,713
Face, your point of entry
is under the hotel.

578
00:38:22,007 --> 00:38:25,051
It'll be packed with foreign press
and private security.

579
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:46,781
B.A., you're in this alleyway
on a stopwatch.

580
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,367
Make sure the bike
has V-twins or better.

581
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:51,744
I got somethin'
a whole lot better than that.

582
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,248
- Bam!
- What about me, boss man?

583
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,752
I had a little
helicopter here someplace.

584
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:03,798
You got some... barrel rolls?
Some mid-air stalls?

585
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:08,178
I'm looking for my... next
near-death experience.

586
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,180
Only air support this time,
captain,

587
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,682
but I'll get you in
on the next one. I promise.

588
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:17,270
B.A., I need you
to pop that clutch at 06:30.

589
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,608
Is that me?

590
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:25,320
Oh, no, I forgot. I'm in an Iraqi sewer.
Thanks, boss!

591
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,285
Timing is everything, Face.

592
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,456
This is all about
the bull's-eyes.

593
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,172
Why not?

594
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:50,553
From under the semi, you'll
take out the truck directly behind you.

595
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,356
Huh?

596
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,777
Now, these guys
are gonna be onto you, Face.

597
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,612
B.A., that's
your cue for throttle.

598
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,740
Be sure to look both ways
before crossing.

599
00:40:10,824 --> 00:40:12,825
And have a nice full tank of gas.

600
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,839
You'll have
multiple hostiles on board, B.A.

601
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,427
Escort them
from the premises.

602
00:40:49,863 --> 00:40:53,741
If any stragglers sneak up behind,
don't worry, I got your back.

603
00:41:06,588 --> 00:41:07,672
Gotcha, kid.

604
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:09,924
Attaboy.

605
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:15,430
That's all fine in theory, but I still
don't see how we get out of Baghdad.

606
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,514
I do.

607
00:41:16,598 --> 00:41:18,558
B.A.! Hang a right!

608
00:41:18,892 --> 00:41:20,893
All right! Hang on!

609
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:28,401
- Watch out! Watch out!
- Heads down!

610
00:41:30,195 --> 00:41:31,821
Oh! Nice one, B.A.!

611
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,159
Face, get the airbags!

612
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:39,620
Gotta make sure
this thing stays locked for later!

613
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,247
Beautiful!

614
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,083
One, two, three.

615
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,425
Hey, boss, airbags do deploy
on impact, right?

616
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,095
B.A., get in the container.

617
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,640
Contact, rear!

618
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,225
Shit!

619
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:21,037
See, this is the part of the plan
I don't trust!

620
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,539
Don't worry, Face!
The rope will hold!

621
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,626
If I was worried, I'd be nailing myself
to the container right now!

622
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,461
Hang on, boys!

623
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,400
Bam! Come on!
I smoked you!

624
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,068
<i>You boys see that
down there?</i>

625
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,362
Murdock?
What is that fool doin' here?

626
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:56,364
<i>Don't lock me in here.
I ain't playing with y'all!</i>

627
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,658
<i>Hey, boss, you ever play
that game at the fun fair</i>

628
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,952
<i>where you try to pick up
a stuffed animal with the claw?</i>

629
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,496
This is a lot like that.

630
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:05,540
That's it!

631
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,375
Did you lock this?

632
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,835
You locked it, didn't you?

633
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,670
Hannibal, open this door
right now, man!

634
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,964
What the...
Are you hookin' this thing?

635
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,091
- You hookin' this up to a helicopter?
- I got you.

636
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,260
What the hell's goin' on?
You ain't that crazy!

637
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,470
Tell me we ain't flyin'!
I'm gonna kill you, fool!

638
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,473
- Boss, is that Bosco?
- Get me out of here!

639
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,475
- That's not good.
- Let me out of here!

640
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,478
<i>That's not good.
He-he is not happy.</i>

641
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,859
<i>Agent Lynch,
I'm patching surveillance</i>

642
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,318
<i>from the general's tent
to you now.</i>

643
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,529
<i>Sir, I have an inbound
V-22 tilt-rotor</i>

644
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:38,114
<i>on approach
from the northwest.</i>

645
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:41,701
<i>Identified friendly.
Landing under the general's orders.</i>

646
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,745
<i>Alpha Delta Alpha, stand down.
Checked, friendly.</i>

647
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,790
<i>Those are our boys.
D-block perimeter around LZ</i>

648
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,001
for essential cargo touchdown.

649
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,738
Russ, we are in the net.

650
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,949
Copy that.
I will be there in five.

651
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,368
I've got a big bottle
of Blue Label waiting.

652
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,246
A bottle?
Make it a case, Scrooge.

653
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,789
See you in a few.

654
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,958
Who's gonna let 'im out?

655
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,502
- You!
- You!

656
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:36,130
What you don't realize is,
now I gotta kill all o' y'all!

657
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:39,842
I'll kill all o' y'all!
Hannibal first, then Murdock!

658
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,802
- Boss man.
- I'm gonna save Face for last!

659
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,596
- Let me try something.
- Go for it.

660
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,098
Is it weird that I'm more scared now
than what we just did?

661
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,392
Bosco, it's Murdock.

662
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,186
Murdock, open this door!

663
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,731
I'll make you some of that
coconut-curry tamponade that you love.

664
00:44:53,815 --> 00:44:55,483
Ooh, that might work.

665
00:44:56,818 --> 00:44:58,486
With toast points?

666
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,613
Hell, yeah, with toast points.
What, you're gonna have that

667
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,365
- with plain old chips?
- Let's do this.

668
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,451
- Damn! You tricked me.
- There he is.

669
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,161
- There he is!
- I hate that!

670
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,288
- Come on!
- Get away from me, man!

671
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,124
The only reason I don't kick y'all asses
is cause you all outrank me.

672
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,043
You should know better!
You know I hate flyin'!

673
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,295
- I'm wet! I stink!
- Hoo! Yeah!

674
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,838
And I can't spend
none of that money!

675
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,799
- Money can't buy happiness.
- Damn, man!

676
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:23,177
Hey, Murdock, you cookin' tonight.
You better get your apron on.

677
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,474
I love it when
a plan comes together.

678
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:36,774
- Hannibal, who was that?
- General?

679
00:45:36,858 --> 00:45:38,192
- Is that the general?
- Russ.

680
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,736
- Get there. Get in there.
General!

681
00:45:41,154 --> 00:45:42,822
- Russ!
- General!

682
00:45:43,156 --> 00:45:44,532
General!

683
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,158
Jesus Christ.

684
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,416
Pike.

685
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,042
Contact rear!

686
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,336
Get in there!

687
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,259
Get there, get there!

688
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,152
After conferring,
we've decided to demote you

689
00:47:03,236 --> 00:47:05,738
to the rank of first lieutenant.

690
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,616
Lieutenant Sosa,
it's nothing personal,

691
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,409
but you lost those plates.

692
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,536
Those were your responsibility.

693
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,330
Consider yourself lucky.

694
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:15,831
Others are going
to prison over this.

695
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,375
Good day, director McCready.

696
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,335
Lieutenant, you're dismissed.

697
00:47:19,961 --> 00:47:22,880
Colonel Smith,
this court has been unable to recover

698
00:47:22,964 --> 00:47:27,259
any direct order from general Morrison
for you to conduct the mission

699
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,345
for which you're being tried.

700
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:32,807
Your Honor,
this was a covert operation

701
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,226
and no official orders
were given.

702
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,938
So the one individual
who can verify

703
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:41,774
the legitimacy of this operation
is deceased. Is that correct, colonel?

704
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,901
No, Your Honor, not deceased.

705
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,195
General Morrison
was murdered.

706
00:47:46,279 --> 00:47:48,781
Colonel, I've been around
a long time.

707
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,785
I've seen units like yours.
They're outlaws.

708
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,538
Units like that
pose a direct threat

709
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,082
to the fabric and fundamentals
of our military.

710
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:03,337
Your Honors, why hasn't
Black Forest been brought to trial?

711
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:08,300
Black Forest and its personnel are
not subject to military jurisdiction.

712
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,846
Where's the plan, boss?
Where is it?

713
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,764
Where's the escape hatch?
Because I don't see it.

714
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,350
- This mission isn't over, lieutenant.
- What mission?

715
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:21,230
I clear our names.
We find Pike and the plates.

716
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,190
No matter what.

717
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:28,362
Your Honors, these men were acting
under my command.

718
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,240
Any judgment should be levied
against me, and me alone.

719
00:48:31,324 --> 00:48:32,491
Absolutely not, sir.

720
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,744
We were all participating
in this operation willingly.

721
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:35,995
I don't wanna be tried
separately.

722
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,663
I refuse to be tried
separately, sir.

723
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,916
In accordance with
the Uniform Code of Military Justice,

724
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,793
this court is rendering
guilty verdicts

725
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,296
for each member of this Alpha Unit,
or A-Team,

726
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,008
and mandating incarceration
in separate maximum-security facilities...

727
00:48:50,343 --> 00:48:52,178
for a period of up to 10 years.

728
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,806
You're all hereby
stripped of formal rank

729
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,184
and dishonorably discharged.

730
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,397
This is bullshit, man.

731
00:49:04,065 --> 00:49:06,192
This session is adjourned.

732
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:12,740
Disgraceful.

733
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,034
- Do not touch me, okay?
- Captain, stand down.

734
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:16,660
Order! Order!

735
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,954
Absolute disgrace!

736
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,207
You happy?
Are you happy, Charissa?

737
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,875
Colonel, control your men!

738
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,878
- Get your hands off me!
- This is a disgrace!

739
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:51,403
Well, hello, Mr. Lynch.
Long time.

740
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,907
You look very relaxed, Lynch.

741
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:56,492
A lot of cameras in here.

742
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,285
Yeah, there are.

743
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:02,039
Yeah, well, they seem to be having
some technical issues at the moment.

744
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,667
May not show up
till playback.

745
00:50:05,418 --> 00:50:06,919
Hannibal.
Can I call you Hannibal?

746
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:10,339
I can't call you colonel anymore.

747
00:50:10,423 --> 00:50:11,924
Six months.

748
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,341
Been waiting for you
to bust outta here

749
00:50:14,341 --> 00:50:18,472
and... round up the rest
of the... Backstreet Boys

750
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,015
and lead me to those plates.

751
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,018
Six months and not a peep.

752
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,980
Everybody thought you and
your team were working with Pike.

753
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,691
Mm. Everybody except you.

754
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:35,990
Pike murdered Morrison. Set me and
my boys up and then stole those plates.

755
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,330
And I know where he is.

756
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,167
Nobody knows where he is.

757
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,882
It's a single image of him.

758
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:56,552
Taken about a month ago,
somewhere in Europe.

759
00:50:57,053 --> 00:51:00,139
We think it's a grab
from a CCTV camera.

760
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,101
Frankfurt, Germany.

761
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,439
How did you get that
in here?

762
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,316
Time, Lynch.

763
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,610
Give me a minute
and I'm good.

764
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,570
If I've got an hour,
I'm great.

765
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:17,823
You give me six months,
I'm unbeatable.

766
00:51:18,491 --> 00:51:19,491
I know Pike.

767
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,784
Who's the Arab?

768
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,912
We don't know.

769
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:26,081
We think he's the deep, dark...
hidden hand in this whole thing.

770
00:51:26,499 --> 00:51:29,001
Maybe a broker, maybe a buyer.

771
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:34,340
Lynch, we have common enemies
and you have limited choices.

772
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:37,068
My team is still your best shot
at getting those plates back.

773
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:38,385
I wouldn't be so sure.

774
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,888
Then why did you make
the long drive out here?

775
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:43,766
You and your boys at Langley
want your own private printing press.

776
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,353
That's about as deep
as your patriotism goes.

777
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,897
So, what would you
need from me?

778
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,942
I swore to my team
that I would clear our names.

779
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:55,861
You of all people must
understand the value of a name.

780
00:51:59,532 --> 00:52:00,532
Now, listen.

781
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:05,746
I want full reinstatement
and clean records

782
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:08,499
for myself and my team.

783
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,834
I can't get you outta here.

784
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,796
Not legally, at least.

785
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,509
This is something the boys
at Langley do very, very well.

786
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,260
Make sure
the dosage is right.

787
00:52:21,554 --> 00:52:24,515
And when I say right,
I mean... perfect.

788
00:52:33,145 --> 00:52:35,693
Cuban. What a shame.

789
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:29,371
You... are not... permitted...

790
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:32,791
in... my... dojo!

791
00:53:36,629 --> 00:53:39,381
So, Satan walks into this bar...

792
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:44,511
Wait a minute.
What's this, a lap pool?

793
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,971
A dry steam room?

794
00:53:46,055 --> 00:53:48,599
Yeah, it'll go
a long way with the boys.

795
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:51,518
How in the hell
do you pull this off?

796
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:54,062
It's not who you know, Bob,
it's how you know 'em.

797
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,732
Oh! Did your boy get back
from Afghanistan?

798
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,777
Yeah. Thanks for getting him home.
His mother and I are real grateful.

799
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,654
- Captain.
- Hey.

800
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,573
You left
something on the bed.

801
00:54:08,369 --> 00:54:10,954
- Could have hid those.
- Why would I wanna do that?

802
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:12,956
I'll see you at 8:00.

803
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:17,211
- And now you wanna build...
- A, uh, uh, lap pool and a dry steam.

804
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,641
Overlooking a sundeck.

805
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,434
Hey, LT, thanks for the boots.

806
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,687
Ah! Come on.
It's my pleasure, baby!

807
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,945
Beautiful.

808
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,200
Listen, now I know
this is good for the body,

809
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:49,993
but how do you protect
the face?

810
00:54:52,413 --> 00:54:54,623
You don't mess with it, kid.

811
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,209
Gotcha.

812
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:00,754
- Thanks for the tan.
- You got it.

813
00:55:03,424 --> 00:55:05,425
Smith has escaped, lieutenant.

814
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,804
Let me go after him.

815
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,640
Smith and his team were working
with Brock Pike and Black Forest.

816
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,976
I can get those plates
back for you, sir.

817
00:55:15,436 --> 00:55:17,062
You know I can.

818
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,273
Holla what? Holla who?

819
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,860
Holla me.

820
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,656
Hey.

821
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:31,910
Hey! Let me out!
Hey, hey! Hey!

822
00:55:33,746 --> 00:55:37,958
I see 'im standing there,
and I was like, uh, "What?"

823
00:55:38,042 --> 00:55:43,338
And... then it turned black and I...
and I woke up, and my face was numb,

824
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,882
and I just, uh...

825
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:47,342
And you mopped up
the footprints that led out,

826
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,678
ignored the fact
that your lab coat,

827
00:55:50,054 --> 00:55:52,723
pass card, car keys
and car were missing.

828
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,433
Looks like he ate Smith.

829
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,519
Gilbert, you've either deliberately

830
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:00,272
aided and abetted
a federal fugitive's escape,

831
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:05,277
or... you're the single dumbest human being
I've ever come into contact with.

832
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,446
- You smell that?
- Don't talk about it.

833
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:09,865
Would you like to know
which way I'm leaning?

834
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:13,911
Forward.

835
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:17,414
I would test
this man's urine, on the hour.

836
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,683
I was a week away
from my parole hearing.

837
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:39,102
You are really tan.

838
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,483
Told you the mission wasn't over.

839
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,780
I'm puttin' the team
back together.

840
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:52,866
I need you, Face.
I can't do this without you.

841
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:58,997
Warden, how did Smith... arrange
a personal visit without your consent

842
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,667
or your signature?
How does that happen?

843
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,419
How the hell
did this guy do that?

844
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,923
Seal that up,
nobody goes in there.

845
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,928
Log-in pages from the day in question
have been removed.

846
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,555
- Why does that not surprise me?
- Torn out.

847
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,600
And the cigar was in the spine
of that book.

848
00:57:19,268 --> 00:57:21,103
- Subtle. It's a good book.
- Right.

849
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:23,897
This... is surveillance
from all around the prison, right?

850
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,023
Mm-hm.

851
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,733
What you're watching is
a signal jammer.

852
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,944
Every time he walks through
one of these things,

853
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:31,822
we get massive interference.
He waltzes in here and waltzes out.

854
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,740
Nobody knows who he is.

855
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,201
God.

856
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:42,499
Yes. The cigar that colonel Smith
broke out of prison with.

857
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:44,501
- Yeah. Wanna hear the crazy part?
- Yes.

858
00:57:44,585 --> 00:57:49,923
Lab reports show lethal amounts of,
wait for it, tetrodotoxin.

859
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:52,134
Tetrodotoxin?
What is that?

860
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:55,220
- The near-death drug.
- Yes! Yes, that sleeping beauty thing.

861
00:57:55,304 --> 00:57:57,264
Yeah. And you know
who likes to use that, right?

862
00:57:57,598 --> 00:57:59,599
- Who?
- Our friends at Langley.

863
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:00,726
It's one of their favorites.

864
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,771
Come on, do you really think that
the CIA came to the prison to visit Smith?

865
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,733
This sounds kind of crazy,
but I think the CIA broke 'im out.

866
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,027
Who put us on?

867
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,573
The same guy that put us on
in Baghdad. Lynch, CIA.

868
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:18,452
What are we talkin' about?
Clean records? Reinstatements?

869
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,203
All of the above.

870
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:25,208
What about Pike...
and the plates?

871
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,044
Payback.

872
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,088
What are they exchanging?
What is that?

873
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,590
Is that how
he got this in here?

874
00:58:35,928 --> 00:58:38,180
One of these things
is not like the other.

875
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,431
I suck at these games.

876
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,643
Where's this plate from?
What is that plate?

877
00:58:44,937 --> 00:58:47,898
It's an "F".
Frankfurt, Germany.

878
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,025
Oh, Frankfurt, Germany.

879
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:52,944
Smith is talkin' to us.
This is not accidental.

880
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,989
With this guy, there's a plan
and two to back it up.

881
00:58:57,241 --> 00:58:59,159
I take it you didn't get
religion inside.

882
00:58:59,243 --> 00:59:02,079
No. I got revenge.

883
00:59:02,955 --> 00:59:04,498
Good.

884
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,877
I know a couple o' guys
that'll feel the exact same way.

885
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:10,837
I'm countin' on it.

886
00:59:36,989 --> 00:59:39,199
Emergency exit now.

887
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:41,660
Hannibal.

888
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,882
Baracus, don't do it!

889
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,761
Where he goin'?
What's he doing, man?

890
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,681
Baracus! Goddamn it!

891
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:10,958
Sosa.

892
01:00:10,958 --> 01:00:12,607
<i>Lieutenant,
Peck's already gone.</i>

893
01:00:13,037 --> 01:00:13,733
What?

894
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,069
<i>Baracus and Murdock are left.
Handle it, lieutenant.</i>

895
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,320
Right. Okay.

896
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,905
<i>I don't wanna be embarrassed
like this again. Do you?</i>

897
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,575
Okay. No, no, no, no, no.
We're gonna catch and deploy from here.

898
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:22,659
Peck escaped.

899
01:00:22,743 --> 01:00:25,203
- Oh, hell. You think Smith is involved?
- Definitely.

900
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:28,039
Get graphics on him and Smith.
Anything that'll ID them instantly.

901
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,125
I know they got Murdock
in a psych ward in Mannheim.

902
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,710
Right. Okay.
Where the hell is B.A. Baracus?

903
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:45,473
How did you know that
once that door was extracted

904
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,601
- that it would take his weight?
- I just did. He's...

905
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:50,228
- You know, he's what, 225-230 pounds?
- 230. Yeah.

906
01:00:50,745 --> 01:00:53,877
Remember the gag we did
in, uh, Venezuela seven years ago?

907
01:00:53,912 --> 01:00:55,233
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

908
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,027
But that was a midget.

909
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,529
Yeah, I wouldn't go for that.

910
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,698
- Hey, big guy. There he is.
- Yeah! He's back.

911
01:01:01,782 --> 01:01:03,575
- Yeah, it's good to be back.
- Come on.

912
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,327
- It's good to be back.
- My man.

913
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:07,287
- It's good to see you, bud.
- You, too, bro. You, too.

914
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,748
- Thanks.
- You look well.

915
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,750
It's good to see you guys.

916
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,839
- What?
- Where's the Mohawk?

917
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:20,592
What, you don't like
my new do, man?

918
01:01:21,677 --> 01:01:24,221
Do I like it? Well, we got you
the clippers. I thought...

919
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:26,097
Yeah, I used them.

920
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:30,435
Hey. What's up, big guy?

921
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,606
Come on,
you can speak to us.

922
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,025
Guys, um...

923
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,446
I can't kill anybody.

924
01:01:44,116 --> 01:01:47,702
- What do you mean?
- I've taken a vow.

925
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,038
- Vow?
- Of non-violence.

926
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:53,416
I'll still do anything for you guys,
you know that.

927
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:56,753
But I just can't kill, man.

928
01:01:57,129 --> 01:01:58,482
Old habits may die hard,

929
01:01:58,482 --> 01:02:02,509
but.. they still gotta die.

930
01:02:03,427 --> 01:02:06,680
When I was a kid,
all you heard in the hood was,

931
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:10,600
"Bosco's a badass,
out collecting scalps."

932
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:14,312
That's where
the Mohawk came from.

933
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:17,315
Was always at war.

934
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,484
And that's what warriors are for.

935
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,487
Hannibal, man.
I don't miss that life.

936
01:02:22,738 --> 01:02:26,032
I'll help you get Murdock,
and right that wrong,

937
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:29,577
- but I can't kill.
- Even Pike?

938
01:02:30,162 --> 01:02:32,122
Even if killing him
would clear your name?

939
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:36,668
My conscience is the only thing
I need clear.

940
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:40,213
Now, where's
that crazy-ass fool?

941
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:44,009
Transference.

942
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,345
Healing feelings.

943
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,348
You can't... warehouse
these things, you know?

944
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,852
You have to...
express to progress.

945
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:58,273
We gotta empower
your emotional tower

946
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:02,319
and send out a wavelength
of self-love and acceptance.

947
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:07,657
Thank you.

948
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:22,339
Clear.

949
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:28,636
He seems completely impervious to it.
It's impossible to develop a base reading.

950
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:30,388
Have you increased the voltage?

951
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,098
Every single session, yes.

952
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,808
- Healing feelings, baby.
- And?

953
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:38,396
Is that all you got?
Here we go.

954
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:39,481
Clear.

955
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,232
Yee-ha!

956
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:46,404
Yeah, I think I might have felt
something there.

957
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,336
Oh, no, I won't sleep.

958
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,171
Howard Little.

959
01:04:03,255 --> 01:04:06,591
You have a package here
from an Annabelle Smith.

960
01:04:07,968 --> 01:04:10,553
I don't know
any Annabelle Smith.

961
01:04:13,557 --> 01:04:15,141
Sure you do, Howie.

962
01:04:15,684 --> 01:04:17,852
Sure you do, baby.
Annabelle.

963
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:21,523
Remember the nurse from Da Nang?
The redhead, double amputee?

964
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:24,317
- Professional hang glider?
- Yes!

965
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,361
Guys.

966
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,113
Annabelle.

967
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:30,073
Yeah. Yeah.

968
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:31,199
Annabelle.

969
01:04:31,283 --> 01:04:35,120
Annabelle.
You have outdone yourself. Look at this.

970
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,372
- It's so real.
- Beauty.

971
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:38,957
A movie in three dimensions.

972
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:41,042
Stand-to, soldier.

973
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:45,088
- Jerries advancing on the Western front.
- Good heavens.

974
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:46,631
Got a secret mission
for you.

975
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:50,135
Take these and distribute them
amongst the men.

976
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:51,719
- Yes, sir.
- Don't fail the Queen.

977
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,138
- No, sir.
- Great.

978
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,222
Yes, sir.

979
01:04:54,598 --> 01:04:56,808
Movie, movie, movie...

980
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:58,685
I knight you.

981
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:01,062
Sir, you have to put your head down.
Stand up and do it again.

982
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:02,939
Movie, movie...

983
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:06,151
Now let's sing to the Queen.
When I ask you... Not yet.

984
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:07,777
- Movie, movie...
- Movie, movie...

985
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:12,490
You get glasses! You get glasses!

986
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:13,867
Ball!

987
01:05:14,034 --> 01:05:15,952
So, when you kneel,
you put your head down straightaway.

988
01:05:16,036 --> 01:05:17,829
Looking me in the eye is disrespectful.
Do you understand?

989
01:05:17,913 --> 01:05:19,330
Movie, movie...

990
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,333
You're looking me in the eye now.
That's wrong.

991
01:05:22,626 --> 01:05:24,919
Movie, movie, movie...

992
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,963
Aquaman? Hello.

993
01:05:27,339 --> 01:05:28,423
You get glasses! You get glasses!

994
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:33,011
Rise, Sir 3D,
and enjoy your motion picture.

995
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:34,971
- Movie! Movie!
- Movie! Movie!

996
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:41,436
Boy, could I use
two hours of not this.

997
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:45,565
Pass out the sedatives
and order some pizzas for these freaks.

998
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:49,068
- Movie, movie...
- Movie, movie...

999
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:52,739
Movie...

1000
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:54,741
Shit.

1001
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,076
Excuse me,
can I help you with something?

1002
01:05:57,244 --> 01:05:59,579
Yes. Captain Murdock,
where is he?

1003
01:05:59,788 --> 01:06:02,207
- Right through there.
- Thank you.

1004
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,791
El diablo.

1005
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:06,920
Okay. Settle down.

1006
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:08,379
No talking
during the movie.

1007
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:12,091
Down in front!

1008
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:17,680
Look, it's 3D, man!

1009
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:19,432
I'm sick of 3D.

1010
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:21,976
Captain Murdock.

1011
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,854
You remember me...
from Baghdad?

1012
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:34,280
Okay, this is pointless.
This guy is fried.

1013
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,657
Yeah, there's a reason
why he's in here.

1014
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:37,992
And his entire team has escaped,
except him.

1015
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,870
Movie!

1016
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:43,706
Take a look around anyway.
Let's make sure he's alone.

1017
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,625
Yes, ma'am.

1018
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,864
Oh, captain,
your chariot awaits.

1019
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:19,242
Sorry, boys, gotta run!
Can't finish the movie.

1020
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:20,660
Do let me know
how it ends.

1021
01:07:20,744 --> 01:07:22,829
Charissa, where are you hiding?
Stay beautiful, baby.

1022
01:07:22,955 --> 01:07:24,914
- Punch it, B.A.
- Let's go, fool.

1023
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,168
Get the truck!

1024
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,547
She's actually
shooting at us.

1025
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:34,173
You guys should see
these bullets in 3D!

1026
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:36,718
- Murdock, get in here!
- It's like we're actually being shot at!

1027
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:38,469
You are gettin' shot at,
you crazy-ass fool!

1028
01:07:41,056 --> 01:07:42,265
- Stop right there!
- Ram it.

1029
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:43,808
Hey! I said halt!

1030
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:49,022
Damn! Sorry, dude.

1031
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,774
It looks like they're headed
for the tarmac.

1032
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:53,609
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1033
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:01,701
- Gentlemen.
- Holy shit, that's Hannibal Smith.

1034
01:08:01,785 --> 01:08:05,371
Are any of you armed
and/or wanted federal fugitives?

1035
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:08,458
- No.
- Well, we're both.

1036
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:10,001
- Which means...
- This is a bad idea.

1037
01:08:10,085 --> 01:08:11,419
This is a bad idea.

1038
01:08:11,503 --> 01:08:13,504
Stop being a baby.
You're a grown-ass man. Get on the plane.

1039
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:16,215
- You're taking the plane?
- And that's why I joined the Army.

1040
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,343
We gotta finish the escape.
Man up and get in there.

1041
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:21,679
Best and brightest.
Appreciate it, boys. That'll be all.

1042
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,431
Who's got the keys?
I just need your keys.

1043
01:08:23,515 --> 01:08:25,600
What you talkin' about keys?
You don't need no keys for no plane.

1044
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:28,144
- I do need keys.
- For what? This is a bad idea.

1045
01:08:28,228 --> 01:08:29,896
We just broke
this guy out of a psych ward.

1046
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:31,731
Hannibal,
you let the real pilots go.

1047
01:08:31,815 --> 01:08:33,524
- B.A., relax. You're gonna be fine.
- Take one of these.

1048
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:37,195
What is this? Will it knock me out?
It better knock me out,

1049
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,613
cause if it don't,
I'm gonna knock you out.

1050
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:40,239
Bosco,
the buttons are confusing me.

1051
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,283
- Shut up, Murdock.
- Come on, Murdock. Let's go.

1052
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,619
You gonna fly this plane?
Forget it. I'll turn myself in.

1053
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:46,204
- What does this do?
- Come on.

1054
01:08:46,538 --> 01:08:48,206
- Come on, Murdock.
- I got lucky.

1055
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:50,458
Hang on, boys.

1056
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,717
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

1057
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,139
Face,
your girlfriend is back.

1058
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,725
- Reverse now.
- Son of a bitch!

1059
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:09,519
Move your ass now.

1060
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:13,398
- The C-130 versus the Mercedes-Benz.
- Lift us off, Murdock.

1061
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:16,526
- How about faster?
- Faster!

1062
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:17,735
I'm trying.
I got it pinned!

1063
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,372
Oh, my God!

1064
01:09:41,593 --> 01:09:42,635
Get us to flight control.

1065
01:09:44,721 --> 01:09:47,223
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we are expecting slight turbulence.</i>

1066
01:09:47,307 --> 01:09:50,059
Please remain in your seats
until the captain has turned off

1067
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:52,270
the "Fasten Seatbelt" sign.

1068
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:55,606
Don't worry, boys! Turbulence
has never brought down a plane!

1069
01:09:58,902 --> 01:10:00,903
What the hell is that?

1070
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:05,283
But... we got inbound subsonic
UAVs with missile lock!

1071
01:10:05,617 --> 01:10:07,702
And they bring down
planes all the time!

1072
01:10:10,622 --> 01:10:13,416
Okay, they're comin' in.
Launching countermeasures!

1073
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:21,883
Whoa!

1074
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:26,471
Did you see that?
That's my diversion!

1075
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,598
They die on this version.

1076
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,981
Hang on! Hang on! Hold on!
We're goin' over.

1077
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,776
Murdock,
what the hell are you doin'?

1078
01:10:41,832 --> 01:10:43,988
You boys remember Mexico?

1079
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:46,866
Whoa!

1080
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:48,743
Ladies and gentlemen,
from the flight deck,

1081
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:51,204
if you look out of the right-hand side
of the aircraft, you'll notice

1082
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:53,456
that your right wing
is on fire.

1083
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:59,128
Tango reacquired.
Missile lock pending, sir.

1084
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:03,090
Lieutenant Charissa Sosa, DCIS.
Major, do not shoot that aircraft down.

1085
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:04,717
Scramble fighters
and force them to land.

1086
01:11:04,801 --> 01:11:06,260
There are federal fugitives
on that plane.

1087
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,678
They've also stolen property
from the U.S. Army.

1088
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:10,431
Billy, Billy, I need you to get the nose-cam
view up here on my monitor now.

1089
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:11,724
It's up, sir. Here it is.

1090
01:11:15,979 --> 01:11:17,647
Missile away, sir.

1091
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:24,695
We have shoot-down. Hercules has been
intercepted and destroyed.

1092
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:27,114
Sorry, lieutenant.
I'm sorry.

1093
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:41,128
- I don't believe it.
- We have chute deployment on the Buford.

1094
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:42,338
What?

1095
01:11:42,422 --> 01:11:44,715
I want these drones taken offline
right now!

1096
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,801
- They're 3,000 miles away.
- Whoever is running those drones.

1097
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:48,469
Get me a direct line
to whoever is running those drones.

1098
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:50,888
We gotta get these drones to stand down
or I'm gonna be on bitch duty.

1099
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,682
I need to get those men alive!

1100
01:11:59,643 --> 01:12:00,724
Everybody okay?

1101
01:12:00,724 --> 01:12:02,233
What are the chances
they think we're dead?

1102
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:06,988
Not great.

1103
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:09,824
- Tell me we ain't still on that plane.
- We ain't on that plane.

1104
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:10,992
- Hannibal!
- Yeah?

1105
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:13,703
If we're under 20,000 feet,
we can still breathe, right?

1106
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:15,329
What are you talking
about 20,000 feet?

1107
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:18,291
- Let's fire up the old weapons system.
- What the hell, man?

1108
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:21,335
Hey, Bosco, a little stuffy.
I'm gonna pop a window!

1109
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:27,258
Yeah!

1110
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:30,678
What you got, bitches?
What you got?

1111
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,765
Yeah!

1112
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:37,143
Let me have a turn, Face!
Come on!

1113
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:40,104
- Why are we in a fallin' tank?
- Because the plane exploded!

1114
01:12:40,188 --> 01:12:41,939
What... What? When?

1115
01:12:42,065 --> 01:12:43,316
Recently!

1116
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:45,943
- The Reapers shot it down!
- What Reapers?

1117
01:12:49,364 --> 01:12:51,616
The same ones
that are still tryin' to kill us!

1118
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,118
- I blame you, Hannibal!
- Technically, we're not flying.

1119
01:12:54,202 --> 01:12:56,579
I know!
Cause we are fallin', fool!

1120
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:04,545
Oh, Jesus!

1121
01:13:06,214 --> 01:13:08,758
UAV-2 has splashed down.
We just lost one of the drones.

1122
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:11,260
Hannibal, we're in trouble!

1123
01:13:12,596 --> 01:13:13,971
Brace yourselves!

1124
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:16,307
Awesome!

1125
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:19,727
Face, get onto the main gun!

1126
01:13:19,811 --> 01:13:22,063
There's a lake a half-mile away
from this position.

1127
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:25,066
- What the hell am I tryin' to hit?
- Trust me!

1128
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:27,985
- Rotate the turret 82 degrees.
- Fire in the hole!

1129
01:13:29,821 --> 01:13:30,946
- Fire!
- Boom!

1130
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:34,325
Fire!

1131
01:13:37,829 --> 01:13:40,081
Are they trying to shoot down
that other drone?

1132
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:42,833
No. They're trying
to fly that tank.

1133
01:13:44,014 --> 01:13:46,379
- He's flying the tank!
- You can't fly a tank, fool!

1134
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:48,547
- Rotate 16 degrees!
- Got it!

1135
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:49,840
Fire!

1136
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:56,555
Rotate 34 degrees now!

1137
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,599
- Hannibal...
- Wait...

1138
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,650
Fire!

1139
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,523
<i>- Control, we have lost...
- Is that a confirmed hit?</i>

1140
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:07,692
Bring turret
full-front and wait!

1141
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:12,988
Murdock! Close the hatch!

1142
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:14,657
Hatch, okay! Did that work?
Did that work?

1143
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:16,242
- Boss!
- Come on, baby.

1144
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,828
- Come on.
- Hatch control?

1145
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,789
I'm too young to die!

1146
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:24,166
Boss! I'm aiming at nothing!

1147
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:26,168
Come on.

1148
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:28,421
- It's been an honor, gentlemen.
- Come on, baby.

1149
01:14:28,505 --> 01:14:31,048
The greatest ride
is the last ride, colonel!

1150
01:14:31,383 --> 01:14:33,718
- Fire everything!
- Come on, baby!

1151
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:44,145
- Get right with God, y'all! This is it!
- Come on!

1152
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:45,187
Yee-ha!

1153
01:15:24,269 --> 01:15:27,021
All right.
Busy bees, busy bees.

1154
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:31,692
Guys, you can take your coats off.
Hot as hell in here.

1155
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:33,360
I'm sweatin'
like a whore in church.

1156
01:15:33,445 --> 01:15:34,570
- Sir.
- Yeah?

1157
01:15:34,654 --> 01:15:37,865
Smith and his team were engaged
in a C-130 over Mannheim, Germany,

1158
01:15:37,949 --> 01:15:39,742
by two Reaper drones.

1159
01:15:40,243 --> 01:15:42,036
I'm not sure
if it's an encryption glitch,

1160
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:45,164
but it says that
they were shot down in a tank.

1161
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:50,211
NORAD's calling it an X-out,
but there is a conflicting report.

1162
01:15:50,837 --> 01:15:52,505
I'm sure there is.

1163
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:55,090
I've got a German Hausfrau
who says she saw a tank

1164
01:15:55,175 --> 01:15:59,011
drive up and out of Lake Wolgastsee
with a guy resembling Murdock...

1165
01:15:59,095 --> 01:16:01,347
Excuse me,
which way to Berlin?

1166
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:04,391
- ...asking for directions to Berlin.
- That's impossible.

1167
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:08,729
Well, this will be the second time
Smith has died this week.

1168
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:10,439
Is that possible?

1169
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:18,739
- What have you got for me?
- Look at this.

1170
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:22,993
We just got the unscrambled composite
of Smith's visitor in prison,

1171
01:16:23,286 --> 01:16:25,454
but with no ID
on the subject yet.

1172
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,832
Hello, handsome.

1173
01:16:29,584 --> 01:16:31,669
Wait, I've seen
this person before.

1174
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:33,379
I know this guy.

1175
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:38,092
Baghdad.

1176
01:16:39,135 --> 01:16:42,388
Get me a clean patch to Langley.
We're goin' fishing.

1177
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:44,014
I barely even heard about it.

1178
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:46,684
I mean, I heard bits and pieces of it,
but how much of that was us?

1179
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:48,102
- So, I have a...
- I was talking.

1180
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:49,603
- It's never us.
- Can you stop?

1181
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:51,981
I have a DoD hardline
from lieutenant Sosa.

1182
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:53,732
She's looking for
agent Lynch.

1183
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,110
He's not available, ever.

1184
01:16:56,194 --> 01:16:58,195
Agent Lynch from Baghdad?

1185
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:02,700
General Morrison's tent?

1186
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:05,452
Out.

1187
01:17:07,205 --> 01:17:08,497
Why do we have 'er?

1188
01:17:09,082 --> 01:17:12,293
She's got a fantastic personality.
That's why.

1189
01:17:13,169 --> 01:17:14,211
With whom
am I speaking?

1190
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:19,133
This is cap, uh... lieutenant Sosa.
Is this agent Lynch?

1191
01:17:19,217 --> 01:17:20,467
I'm sorry, I don't have
a first name.

1192
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:24,054
Neither do I. So, what
can I do you for, lieutenant?

1193
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:26,181
I'm looking
at an image of you

1194
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:29,268
<i>from the disciplinary barracks
at Fort Carson.</i>

1195
01:17:30,186 --> 01:17:31,270
She's hot.

1196
01:17:31,354 --> 01:17:34,231
Did you visit former colonel
Hannibal Smith in prison?

1197
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:41,739
I don't know... what
you're talking about, former captain.

1198
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:44,575
<i>Agent Lynch,
if you facilitated Smith's escape</i>

1199
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:46,785
<i>and are currently aiding and
abetting him...</i>

1200
01:17:48,496 --> 01:17:50,873
Ooh, buddy.

1201
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:52,833
<i>If you can make something
like that stick,</i>

1202
01:17:53,376 --> 01:17:55,419
your next promotion
should be in the five-star range.

1203
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:58,547
And if you're helping to retrieve
those engraving plates,

1204
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:03,385
<i>I'm going to have to go out
of my way to disappoint you.</i>

1205
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:17,024
I want 'er phones, her computers,
any support packages she operates.

1206
01:18:17,108 --> 01:18:20,319
I wanna know everything. I want active
intercept taps on everything she's got.

1207
01:18:20,403 --> 01:18:22,237
I want every move monitored
from this moment forward.

1208
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:24,198
You realize she's DoD.

1209
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:27,952
I don't care
if she's G-O-D. Do it.

1210
01:18:29,829 --> 01:18:32,039
Boss, check this out.

1211
01:18:32,123 --> 01:18:35,250
We've tracked this photograph of Pike
to the Konigsbank in Frankfurt.

1212
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:38,045
Our surveillance has him
and an unknown Arab

1213
01:18:38,129 --> 01:18:40,506
making regular trips
from the train station to the bank

1214
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:42,549
all over the last month.

1215
01:18:42,759 --> 01:18:44,718
- Pike's getting sloppy.
- Yeah, but if we're onto him,

1216
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:47,388
what are the odds that Smith and his team
are onto Pike and the Arab, too?

1217
01:18:47,472 --> 01:18:50,808
No, no, no, this is a direct
pull-down from the Pentagon's database.

1218
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:53,560
There's absolutely no way Smith
and his team could have this stuff.

1219
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:57,398
I think we should assume they have
more information than us at all times.

1220
01:18:58,108 --> 01:19:00,192
Pike has been moving
the stolen engraving plates

1221
01:19:00,276 --> 01:19:03,153
to the Konigsbank Tower in
Frankfurt over the past month.

1222
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,823
Tomorrow, the last of the cases
containing these plates

1223
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:08,242
will be transferred to the Arab.

1224
01:19:08,451 --> 01:19:10,577
This will mark the only time
in the last six months

1225
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:12,454
that all of the plates
have been in one location.

1226
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:15,791
It's our best and only shot
at gettin' them back.

1227
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:19,545
They leave the Konigsbank Tower
for the 7:15 train to Zurich.

1228
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:24,675
Gentlemen, we're gonna
make sure they miss that train.

1229
01:19:25,468 --> 01:19:26,927
- Face?
- Yeah.

1230
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:29,138
Time to bring in
your former flame.

1231
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:30,669
If she's as good as I think,

1232
01:19:30,669 --> 01:19:34,309
then she'll be on her way to Frankfurt
to intercept those plates.

1233
01:19:36,646 --> 01:19:39,314
- Why would you tip her off?
- She's a crusader,

1234
01:19:39,607 --> 01:19:41,358
and we're gonna need 'er
teed up at some point.

1235
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:42,901
Keep your eyes
and ears open, boys.

1236
01:19:42,986 --> 01:19:44,695
Charissa Sosa...

1237
01:19:46,197 --> 01:19:47,656
Charissa Sosa...

1238
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:49,158
Now the wrinkle.

1239
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,704
If Sosa's onto us, we can assume
that Lynch is onto her.

1240
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:58,542
And if he thinks she stands
between him and those plates,

1241
01:19:59,002 --> 01:20:00,544
he won't hesitate to kill 'er.

1242
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,671
Face, get
to the train station.

1243
01:20:05,717 --> 01:20:07,176
This is Sosa.

1244
01:20:08,678 --> 01:20:10,888
If there's a threat from Lynch,
deal with it.

1245
01:20:11,514 --> 01:20:12,681
Hello?

1246
01:20:13,266 --> 01:20:16,060
<i>Shoot is green.
Say again, shoot is green.</i>

1247
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:18,479
Hello?

1248
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:26,737
Something's wrong.

1249
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:32,826
We're marked, guys. Pull back.
I don't like this at all.

1250
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:34,620
See. Don't be seen.

1251
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:40,334
<i>- Hello, beautiful.
- You have got some balls.</i>

1252
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:41,960
- You put a drop phone on me?
- I had to, babe.

1253
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:44,838
<i>It's the only way I could talk to you.
Lynch has all your comm lines.</i>

1254
01:20:45,298 --> 01:20:48,342
<i>- I want you to pull your team now.
- I'm gonna find you, Face.</i>

1255
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:51,220
But do not engage her
or anyone else directly.

1256
01:20:51,304 --> 01:20:52,679
Not if I find you first.

1257
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,356
Come on, all right...
Okay. Okay.

1258
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:07,694
Ow! Ow! Jesus!

1259
01:21:08,655 --> 01:21:10,989
- What the hell are you doing?
- Tryin' to save you!

1260
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:16,495
Charissa.

1261
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:21,041
Come on, you know
we're innocent. You know this.

1262
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:24,169
You're lying.
Like you lied in Baghdad.

1263
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:27,172
I did not know.
I knew nothing about the plates.

1264
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:29,424
At that... At that time.

1265
01:21:29,634 --> 01:21:31,969
You are completely
full of shit!

1266
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,470
Will you stop
selling yourself on that

1267
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,180
and avoiding the fact
that you lied to me!

1268
01:21:35,265 --> 01:21:36,348
- You're the one that misled me.
- When?

1269
01:21:36,432 --> 01:21:38,517
- Oh, come on. You wanna go there?
- Yeah, let's go there.

1270
01:21:38,601 --> 01:21:40,394
You heard I was a player
and you wanted to play.

1271
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:42,646
And then I got serious
and you freaked!

1272
01:21:42,939 --> 01:21:44,898
- Oh, I freaked? I did not freak!
- Yes, you did.

1273
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:48,527
You panicked and... you ran.

1274
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:56,368
Charissa, come on.

1275
01:21:56,452 --> 01:21:59,663
I'm a federal fugitive.
You know exactly how wanted I am.

1276
01:21:59,747 --> 01:22:03,834
You think I came to Frankfurt
to hash out some old heartbreak? No!

1277
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:07,379
I'm here because we didn't do this.
I'm here because we were set up.

1278
01:22:07,463 --> 01:22:11,091
I'm here because, in the end,
the truth is worth the risk.

1279
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:17,306
And I believe in you,
even if you don't believe in me.

1280
01:22:21,936 --> 01:22:24,479
God, I forgot
how beautiful you are.

1281
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:31,862
Hold on to that phone.

1282
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:45,375
Oh, my God!

1283
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,585
He's got a gun!

1284
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:48,086
Right there!
He's got a gun!

1285
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:49,880
A gun!

1286
01:22:49,964 --> 01:22:51,340
Sucker.

1287
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:55,135
- Oh, shit.
- Where's Peck?

1288
01:22:56,554 --> 01:22:58,222
Excellent question.
Find 'im!

1289
01:22:58,681 --> 01:23:01,558
<i>Please stay calm
and go to the nearest exit.</i>

1290
01:23:31,756 --> 01:23:33,090
<i>Meet you up
on corridor three.</i>

1291
01:23:36,761 --> 01:23:39,429
<i>Three to base.
We're all clear at this time.</i>

1292
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:44,309
<i>Give me confirmation
as soon as the package is secure.</i>

1293
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,106
<i>We need a video feed.</i>

1294
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:11,294
Okay, let's dance.

1295
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:13,880
Coming down.
Positions, prepare to move.

1296
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:16,466
As always,
stay close to me, sir.

1297
01:24:31,524 --> 01:24:33,150
<i>Closing off the 10th floor.</i>

1298
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,779
<i>Tenth floor, we need backup.</i>

1299
01:24:38,656 --> 01:24:39,656
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

1300
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:41,241
<i>I can't see anything.</i>

1301
01:24:41,492 --> 01:24:42,659
How we doin' there,
big man?

1302
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:44,411
<i>Murdock,
here comes the Arab.</i>

1303
01:24:44,495 --> 01:24:46,163
And here's a long drive

1304
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:48,165
hit deep into
left center field.

1305
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:52,210
Murdock's back, he's at the wall,
and he makes the catch!

1306
01:24:53,379 --> 01:24:54,504
I can't breathe.

1307
01:24:55,339 --> 01:24:56,673
It's a trap!

1308
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:00,802
Pete, we need backup!

1309
01:25:16,152 --> 01:25:18,028
<i>B.A., I lost the case.</i>

1310
01:25:18,863 --> 01:25:20,489
<i>I'm taking fire.
I'm outta here.</i>

1311
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:31,166
B.A., get to those plates.

1312
01:26:28,432 --> 01:26:30,559
Deutsche Federal is responding
to explosions and shots fired

1313
01:26:30,643 --> 01:26:32,769
- at the Konigsbank building.
- Get us out of this mess and get us

1314
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:34,938
- to that building as soon as possible.
- Yes, ma'am.

1315
01:26:56,627 --> 01:26:59,212
You made me work
for this one, Baracus.

1316
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:02,048
I didn't think
I was this out of shape.

1317
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:04,301
I am, unfortunately.

1318
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:06,386
Where's the rest
of the team, huh?

1319
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:10,640
Smith. Peck. That idiot pilot,
the asshole. What's his name?

1320
01:27:17,523 --> 01:27:20,317
I'm gonna take this one out o' your ass,
Baracus. Let's see what you got.

1321
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:26,698
Come on. What are you doin'?
What, are you tired?

1322
01:27:26,782 --> 01:27:27,949
I'm not gonna hurt you, man.

1323
01:27:28,034 --> 01:27:30,035
No, you're not gonna hurt me,
I'm gonna hurt you.

1324
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:37,709
- I don't wanna kill you, man.
- You don't wanna kill me?

1325
01:27:37,793 --> 01:27:39,711
You're not gonna kill me.
I'm gonna kill you, Baracus.

1326
01:27:39,795 --> 01:27:40,921
I'm not playin' with you, Pike.

1327
01:27:41,005 --> 01:27:44,049
Here we go, cause I got two guns.
I'm a lefty, remember that, right?

1328
01:27:44,133 --> 01:27:46,509
So, as soon as
that hammer goes back, it's on.

1329
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:48,303
I swear to God, I'll do it.

1330
01:27:48,387 --> 01:27:50,388
You're not a coward,
are you?

1331
01:27:51,307 --> 01:27:53,099
Are you?

1332
01:27:57,271 --> 01:27:58,271
Whoopsy.

1333
01:27:58,356 --> 01:27:59,439
Damn!

1334
01:27:59,523 --> 01:28:01,107
- Need a ride, big fella?
- You're a life-saver, man.

1335
01:28:01,192 --> 01:28:02,275
I couldn't shoot 'im.

1336
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:13,203
Get out of the way!
Get down! Get down!

1337
01:28:38,145 --> 01:28:41,064
U.S. Military!
Put them down. Put them down.

1338
01:28:43,901 --> 01:28:45,151
This is U.S. Military.
We got him.

1339
01:28:45,236 --> 01:28:48,154
Yeah, this is about
the right amount of cops.

1340
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:51,366
That's cute. You're lucky
there are people around.

1341
01:28:51,742 --> 01:28:54,244
No, sweetheart, you're lucky.

1342
01:29:01,919 --> 01:29:04,734
- You eat that cold?
- Any way I can get it.

1343
01:29:05,881 --> 01:29:07,424
There's a leak in the...
in the roof.

1344
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:08,508
There's a lot of 'em.

1345
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,094
- Is that them?
- I got it.

1346
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:17,851
All right. Not a peep
outta the Arab.

1347
01:29:18,436 --> 01:29:19,769
Sosa was
at the train station.

1348
01:29:20,271 --> 01:29:22,105
- You saw her?
- Yeah.

1349
01:29:22,815 --> 01:29:24,149
Did you talk to 'er?

1350
01:29:24,233 --> 01:29:26,943
I had no choice, okay?
Just... trust me on that.

1351
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:29,863
Oh, I trust you... to make
historically bad decisions

1352
01:29:29,947 --> 01:29:31,364
as far as women
are concerned.

1353
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:33,783
What part of you
is thinking at the moment?

1354
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:36,119
Lynch's men moved in
on 'er and I had to react.

1355
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:37,579
That's why you wanted me there
in the first place...

1356
01:29:37,663 --> 01:29:39,748
To stop them!
Not to engage her!

1357
01:29:39,832 --> 01:29:41,249
I couldn't do one
without the other.

1358
01:29:41,792 --> 01:29:44,878
Please.
Somehow I doubt that.

1359
01:29:44,962 --> 01:29:47,797
Hey. What are you so pissed about?
We got the plates.

1360
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:50,216
You wanted her teed up.
She's teed up.

1361
01:29:50,301 --> 01:29:52,635
She knows
we didn't steal them.

1362
01:29:53,262 --> 01:29:55,972
She'll be thrilled
to find out who did.

1363
01:29:57,808 --> 01:29:58,892
What?

1364
01:30:03,314 --> 01:30:07,233
You had to know.
You had to know.

1365
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:15,241
You had to know if you left me alive,
that this was coming.

1366
01:30:21,457 --> 01:30:23,124
How could you not?

1367
01:30:28,881 --> 01:30:35,688
You... taught me...
almost everything I know.

1368
01:30:36,472 --> 01:30:40,600
Hannibal.
You know who this is?

1369
01:30:52,363 --> 01:30:53,446
We all do.

1370
01:30:57,618 --> 01:30:58,868
Morrison?

1371
01:30:59,203 --> 01:31:00,829
Oh, hell, no.

1372
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:03,498
Jesus Christ.

1373
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:08,545
<i>Not so sure that it is a blessing,
but good hunting, my friend.</i>

1374
01:31:11,298 --> 01:31:12,382
<i>Thank you.</i>

1375
01:31:13,342 --> 01:31:15,051
You son of a bitch.

1376
01:31:20,891 --> 01:31:23,434
Morrison? Holy shit!

1377
01:31:30,943 --> 01:31:31,943
You're not a general.

1378
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:34,404
How could you
do this to him?

1379
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:36,739
How could you
do this to us?

1380
01:31:38,075 --> 01:31:39,826
You know nothing
about leading men.

1381
01:31:40,369 --> 01:31:44,706
I knew if Lynch helped me escape,
you had to be part of it.

1382
01:31:47,126 --> 01:31:50,170
You and Pike were making a play
on those plates with Lynch,

1383
01:31:50,254 --> 01:31:51,504
and you turned on 'im.

1384
01:31:52,214 --> 01:31:53,923
The way you turned on us.

1385
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:56,342
Lynch was never
gonna cut us in.

1386
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:00,763
He was gonna use us.

1387
01:32:01,932 --> 01:32:04,267
He brought you on
as insurance.

1388
01:32:04,476 --> 01:32:08,021
He never thought you'd betray
your oldest living friend.

1389
01:32:08,689 --> 01:32:11,774
I just hit first, Hannibal.
I'm a fighting man.

1390
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:13,484
You're a liar
and a traitor!

1391
01:32:13,569 --> 01:32:15,862
Then don't draw this out.
Kill me.

1392
01:32:15,946 --> 01:32:18,489
That's a fantastic idea!

1393
01:32:18,908 --> 01:32:20,116
Whoa! Whoa!

1394
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:21,326
Boss, let me do this.

1395
01:32:21,326 --> 01:32:24,746
Face... I ain't killing nobody.

1396
01:32:24,955 --> 01:32:27,957
You're not, Bosco. I am.

1397
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:30,210
No matter what he says,
do not kill him, okay?

1398
01:32:30,294 --> 01:32:32,045
You guys don't wanna watch?
Just turn your heads.

1399
01:32:32,129 --> 01:32:34,881
- I'm not gonna be party to it neither.
- I wanna kill the son of a bitch, too,

1400
01:32:34,965 --> 01:32:36,257
but he's our ticket out.

1401
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:38,468
He knows what he's talking
about for once. Listen to him.

1402
01:32:38,552 --> 01:32:41,429
- Face, he is our only evidence.
- Murdock, Murdock...

1403
01:32:41,513 --> 01:32:42,847
- Do you understand?
- He put us here.

1404
01:32:42,932 --> 01:32:45,850
You can blow his head off
after he testifies, okay?

1405
01:32:45,935 --> 01:32:46,893
He's ruined it!

1406
01:32:46,977 --> 01:32:48,519
- Think what you're doing, Face.
- All right.

1407
01:32:48,604 --> 01:32:50,313
- If you can't handle it...
- Boys, enough.

1408
01:32:52,483 --> 01:32:54,692
Enough!
That's enough, Face.

1409
01:32:54,777 --> 01:32:57,070
Enough! Step down!

1410
01:32:57,154 --> 01:32:58,821
Everybody outside.

1411
01:32:59,156 --> 01:33:00,531
I got 'im.

1412
01:33:00,824 --> 01:33:03,326
- I don't want you to have to do it.
- Face, outside.

1413
01:33:04,161 --> 01:33:05,495
Stand down, soldier.

1414
01:33:05,829 --> 01:33:08,164
Face. Now!

1415
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:10,625
- Fucking stupid.
- You okay, man?

1416
01:33:13,587 --> 01:33:15,588
You knew Morrison
was masquerading as the Arab.

1417
01:33:15,673 --> 01:33:17,840
- Why not share that?
- I wasn't 100% sure.

1418
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:19,425
How about 99%?

1419
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:22,262
Would you think
it was worth mentioning then?

1420
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:24,305
Lynch, what did you think?

1421
01:33:25,015 --> 01:33:26,599
<i>You think I'd just kill him
on the spot?</i>

1422
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:29,102
I was certain of it.
I still am.

1423
01:33:29,186 --> 01:33:31,104
<i>Do you have the plates?</i>

1424
01:33:31,188 --> 01:33:32,855
I wouldn't be calling you
if I didn't.

1425
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:38,319
Smith, return the plates, kill Morrison,
and reclaim your lives.

1426
01:33:38,529 --> 01:33:41,572
I want signed and authorized
amnesty agreements

1427
01:33:41,657 --> 01:33:44,075
for myself and
for each of my men.

1428
01:33:44,201 --> 01:33:46,119
<i>From the White House,
the State Department</i>

1429
01:33:46,203 --> 01:33:48,246
<i>and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</i>

1430
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:49,831
You hear me?

1431
01:33:52,418 --> 01:33:53,751
I'm gonna need
a little more time.

1432
01:33:55,254 --> 01:33:56,337
How much?

1433
01:34:02,886 --> 01:34:03,886
Give me five minutes.

1434
01:34:04,638 --> 01:34:05,888
I'm waitin'.

1435
01:34:15,691 --> 01:34:17,692
Don't you get it, Hannibal?

1436
01:34:19,069 --> 01:34:21,404
We fight for 'em, we bleed for 'em,
we die for 'em...

1437
01:34:21,488 --> 01:34:23,197
They don't give a rat's ass.

1438
01:34:23,949 --> 01:34:25,325
Death and destruction,

1439
01:34:25,409 --> 01:34:28,703
they're selling it like it was on
the goddamn commodities exchange.

1440
01:34:28,787 --> 01:34:31,664
Don't push this off on them.
This is not about them.

1441
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:35,501
Your war protest was
stealing billions o' dollars!

1442
01:34:36,962 --> 01:34:37,962
Who are you?

1443
01:34:38,297 --> 01:34:40,590
I am a general.
You are a colonel.

1444
01:34:40,674 --> 01:34:44,344
I say "Jump" and you say
"How high?". End of story.

1445
01:34:44,428 --> 01:34:45,428
It is now.

1446
01:34:49,433 --> 01:34:51,601
I saw your tomb
at Arlington.

1447
01:34:52,811 --> 01:34:55,772
You died a national hero.

1448
01:35:08,702 --> 01:35:09,994
Death's too easy.

1449
01:35:10,621 --> 01:35:13,206
And the last thing
we need now is another lie.

1450
01:35:13,290 --> 01:35:16,334
Don't do this. Hannibal, please.
You owe me that much.

1451
01:35:16,418 --> 01:35:18,002
You owe me!

1452
01:35:18,837 --> 01:35:20,588
You're gonna tell 'em
we're innocent.

1453
01:35:22,758 --> 01:35:24,133
You owe me.

1454
01:35:25,969 --> 01:35:28,054
Hannibal, it's meaningless.

1455
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:31,224
What are you fightin' for now,
you and those boys?

1456
01:35:31,308 --> 01:35:34,102
Your ranks?
Your reputations?

1457
01:35:34,186 --> 01:35:35,269
They're shit!

1458
01:35:36,021 --> 01:35:37,647
You're convicts!

1459
01:35:37,815 --> 01:35:41,109
Plates, no plates,
you are federal fugitives,

1460
01:35:41,193 --> 01:35:44,987
and when they're done with you,
Hannibal, they just fucking burn you.

1461
01:35:45,906 --> 01:35:50,034
Zulu one, Zulu one, this is Broadsword,
you're clear to engage.

1462
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:52,453
"Broadsword."
Did you come up with that?

1463
01:35:52,538 --> 01:35:54,914
That's awesome.
"Broadsword. "

1464
01:35:55,165 --> 01:35:56,666
"Broadsword."

1465
01:35:59,169 --> 01:36:00,753
Boss, could you do that?

1466
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:05,007
To us?

1467
01:36:05,676 --> 01:36:07,176
What Morrison did?

1468
01:36:07,464 --> 01:36:10,012
No. Not in a million years.

1469
01:36:11,849 --> 01:36:13,558
Yeah, but you didn't see it
coming, though.

1470
01:36:14,101 --> 01:36:15,476
How long did you know
it was him?

1471
01:36:15,561 --> 01:36:16,853
Are you guys crazy?

1472
01:36:17,229 --> 01:36:19,147
I know you are, but, Face,
are you accusing 'im?

1473
01:36:19,147 --> 01:36:21,190
Hey! Hey!

1474
01:36:23,193 --> 01:36:26,028
I'd rather face a firing squad
than betray you boys.

1475
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:27,905
Don't let this tear us apart.

1476
01:36:28,574 --> 01:36:29,574
Not now.

1477
01:36:30,492 --> 01:36:32,785
Not when we need each other
like no other time before.

1478
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:39,709
Move!

1479
01:36:51,763 --> 01:36:54,557
Wow. That's awesome.

1480
01:36:54,933 --> 01:36:57,351
That looks exactly like
"Call of Duty", doesn't it?

1481
01:36:57,561 --> 01:36:59,604
All right. Here's the deal.
No press release.

1482
01:36:59,688 --> 01:37:01,981
Keep local law enforcement
and media off-site.

1483
01:37:02,065 --> 01:37:04,567
Get a three-mile cordon,
ditto the no-fly zone.

1484
01:37:04,651 --> 01:37:09,113
Get an agency scrub team out there
and get me the goddamn plates back.

1485
01:37:10,574 --> 01:37:15,161
The German police have your entire team
in custody in the Konigsbank Tower.

1486
01:37:16,997 --> 01:37:20,875
I don't do teams, babe. That's
Smith's bag. I'm strictly a solo act.

1487
01:37:29,801 --> 01:37:32,053
I like to travel light.

1488
01:37:32,137 --> 01:37:36,599
Stuff like, uh, loyalty doesn't, uh...
fit in the overhead bins.

1489
01:37:37,893 --> 01:37:40,895
I thought you and Smith
were working together.

1490
01:37:41,438 --> 01:37:43,105
You thought wrong.

1491
01:37:43,315 --> 01:37:46,567
Yes, we have weapons.
No, you may not wand us.

1492
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,738
If you wanna deal,
we can deal.

1493
01:37:51,573 --> 01:37:55,785
How about I... dedicate
my immediate future

1494
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:58,412
to destroying yours?

1495
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:02,667
How about you get smart
and start dealing

1496
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:05,211
before somebody else does?

1497
01:38:07,631 --> 01:38:08,631
Former captain.

1498
01:38:08,715 --> 01:38:10,883
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1499
01:38:10,968 --> 01:38:13,719
Unless you got a piece of paper
that looks exactly like this one,

1500
01:38:13,804 --> 01:38:16,889
then this troubled young loner
belongs to me.

1501
01:38:16,974 --> 01:38:18,266
Let's go.

1502
01:38:18,934 --> 01:38:20,810
How the hell did they
get an extradition order?

1503
01:38:20,894 --> 01:38:23,688
Sorry, Pike.
At least with me, there are rules.

1504
01:38:23,772 --> 01:38:26,691
CIA's got rules. Our rules
are just cooler than yours.

1505
01:38:27,859 --> 01:38:29,151
- Go.
- You know, Lynch,

1506
01:38:29,236 --> 01:38:32,822
if I could seal this room with you inside,
I'd be doing the world a big favor.

1507
01:38:32,906 --> 01:38:35,074
That's not nice.

1508
01:38:35,290 --> 01:38:37,201
- Lynch?
- Had to be.

1509
01:38:38,704 --> 01:38:40,746
Stay close to the fires, boys.

1510
01:38:40,831 --> 01:38:44,542
If that gunship is still around,
it won't read our body heat.

1511
01:38:44,626 --> 01:38:48,838
That idiot Lynch, so quick to kill us,
didn't even bother locating the plates.

1512
01:38:49,339 --> 01:38:51,924
Where do we stand
on the non-violence now, B.A.?

1513
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:54,010
You pissed? You should be.

1514
01:38:54,177 --> 01:38:57,513
Who gives a shit about the plates?
Morrison was the only way to clear us.

1515
01:38:57,598 --> 01:39:00,182
And without Morrison,
we got nothin'.

1516
01:39:01,518 --> 01:39:04,020
- What do we do, boss?
- I don't know, Murdock.

1517
01:39:04,605 --> 01:39:06,355
- I don't know.
- I do.

1518
01:39:08,358 --> 01:39:11,902
This guy Lynch,
I think I got 'im figured out.

1519
01:39:12,279 --> 01:39:14,530
- You got a plan, kid?
- How do we get outta here?

1520
01:39:16,199 --> 01:39:17,325
Gimme 20 minutes.

1521
01:39:22,497 --> 01:39:25,666
So, Morrison's dead.
Smith and his team are dead.

1522
01:39:25,876 --> 01:39:28,794
Another 15 minutes or so,
we locate those engraving plates.

1523
01:39:28,879 --> 01:39:30,421
What is this?
Are you gloating?

1524
01:39:30,505 --> 01:39:33,883
No, this is me beating you...
after you burned me.

1525
01:39:34,217 --> 01:39:36,302
- We had a deal, remember?
- Not you and me.

1526
01:39:36,386 --> 01:39:38,137
- You, me and Morrison.
- Not you and me, directly.

1527
01:39:38,221 --> 01:39:40,806
And you two collude
and cut me out?

1528
01:39:43,352 --> 01:39:44,685
Hey. What are you doing?
In the car?

1529
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:46,270
Are we doing...
Are we gonna do this in the car?

1530
01:39:46,355 --> 01:39:48,439
You doin' this?
He's gonna do it.

1531
01:39:48,523 --> 01:39:51,025
Way to go.
That's brilliant, right there.

1532
01:39:51,109 --> 01:39:52,777
What are you doing?
What is he doing?

1533
01:39:52,861 --> 01:39:54,570
- Jesus.
- How's it going, Kyle?

1534
01:39:54,655 --> 01:39:56,739
- You all right?
- I'm good.

1535
01:39:56,865 --> 01:39:59,617
Brother, you are far from good.
What are you doing?

1536
01:39:59,701 --> 01:40:01,661
It's a European silencer.

1537
01:40:01,745 --> 01:40:05,081
It's a suppressor. Counter-clockwise.
You're holding a gun like that?

1538
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:06,999
You've held a gun like that before
and you're still here?

1539
01:40:07,084 --> 01:40:08,584
That's amazing.

1540
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:10,336
- Don't point that thing...
- Jesus. Final request,

1541
01:40:10,420 --> 01:40:12,004
don't let this guy
shoot me, please.

1542
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:20,513
So, if Sosa knows
we're alive...

1543
01:40:20,597 --> 01:40:23,057
She'll believe
Morrison is alive, too.

1544
01:40:23,308 --> 01:40:26,102
Let's just hope that Lynch
still has Sosa's comm lines.

1545
01:40:29,606 --> 01:40:31,065
This is Sosa.

1546
01:40:31,233 --> 01:40:33,776
<i>General Morrison
is in my possession.</i>

1547
01:40:34,486 --> 01:40:37,446
What? I'm sorry. I can't...
I can't hear you. Who is this?

1548
01:40:38,323 --> 01:40:40,741
- Okay, this was not well thought out.
- No shit.

1549
01:40:40,826 --> 01:40:42,702
I mean, look at this.
Am I to teach you how to kill me?

1550
01:40:42,786 --> 01:40:44,495
Hey, do me a favor, all right?
Put the barrel...

1551
01:40:44,579 --> 01:40:46,038
Put the gun
flush to my head.

1552
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:47,873
- Are you sure?
- There you go, right there.

1553
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:51,377
- Is that gonna go through?
- Before you hurt somebody besides me.

1554
01:40:51,461 --> 01:40:52,753
There you go.
We're okay. We're okay.

1555
01:40:53,964 --> 01:40:56,674
Never cuff a man in a seated position
with his hands behind his back.

1556
01:40:56,758 --> 01:40:58,592
Makes it impossible
to see the hands.

1557
01:40:58,677 --> 01:41:00,177
That was cool.

1558
01:41:00,345 --> 01:41:02,221
- You like that?
- Oh, I like that.

1559
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:03,889
I like that a lot.

1560
01:41:03,974 --> 01:41:05,683
Are you all right,
you idiot?

1561
01:41:05,767 --> 01:41:08,644
- Yeah. It was a good hit.
- Please handcuff him.

1562
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:10,646
We don't need to use 'em again.
We don't need the cuffs.

1563
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:11,897
Who are you talkin' to?

1564
01:41:11,982 --> 01:41:12,940
- Brad, phone or gun.
- Jesus.

1565
01:41:13,817 --> 01:41:15,735
- Phone or gun. Pick.
- Hey, hey.

1566
01:41:15,819 --> 01:41:19,363
- Put the gun down.
- Hey, I didn't burn you. Morrison did.

1567
01:41:19,489 --> 01:41:20,740
I really wanna shoot you.

1568
01:41:20,824 --> 01:41:22,825
You gotta hear this, sir.

1569
01:41:22,993 --> 01:41:24,535
<i>Is this Smith?</i>

1570
01:41:24,911 --> 01:41:27,413
<i>From a former colonel
to a former captain,</i>

1571
01:41:27,497 --> 01:41:30,541
<i>I know I got about 30 seconds
before you lock this signal.</i>

1572
01:41:30,625 --> 01:41:33,753
<i>- So listen, we can prove our innocence.
- Leave that on the floor like that?</i>

1573
01:41:34,129 --> 01:41:36,255
O-okay. All right.
Now, go back.

1574
01:41:36,339 --> 01:41:38,924
Did you say you have Morrison?
You have general Morrison?

1575
01:41:39,384 --> 01:41:41,135
- Correct.
- You have him alive?

1576
01:41:41,186 --> 01:41:44,972
<i>And well, despite Lynch
tryin' to wipe us out wholesale.</i>

1577
01:41:45,849 --> 01:41:49,351
Too much to explain now
but Morrison's testimony frees us

1578
01:41:49,686 --> 01:41:51,270
<i>and fries Lynch.</i>

1579
01:41:53,523 --> 01:41:54,523
Uh-oh.

1580
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:56,400
Well, not without the plates.

1581
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:58,319
<i>Also in my possession.</i>

1582
01:41:58,570 --> 01:42:02,448
Remember, Lynch thinks we're dead,
and I wanna keep it that way.

1583
01:42:02,532 --> 01:42:03,991
- Give me a pen.
- All right. We'll deal.

1584
01:42:04,075 --> 01:42:05,534
- Where and when?
- Got a pen? Anybody got a pen?

1585
01:42:05,619 --> 01:42:07,912
- L.A. docks, 48 hours, dawn.
- You still use a pen?

1586
01:42:09,498 --> 01:42:11,957
<i>I deliver Morrison and the plates.</i>

1587
01:42:12,083 --> 01:42:16,003
In return, I want a retrial
in front of a civilian court.

1588
01:42:16,546 --> 01:42:18,672
All right. We'll deal.

1589
01:42:19,382 --> 01:42:21,509
L.A. docks,
48 hours from now.

1590
01:42:21,718 --> 01:42:25,304
Any bullshit from your end,
and that's it, deal's off.

1591
01:42:28,099 --> 01:42:30,476
- Did we get 'im?
- No.

1592
01:42:33,355 --> 01:42:34,438
Pike.

1593
01:42:35,148 --> 01:42:37,358
You believe
in second chances?

1594
01:42:37,442 --> 01:42:38,567
Uh...

1595
01:42:39,277 --> 01:42:40,402
I do now.

1596
01:42:41,112 --> 01:42:42,488
Too much?

1597
01:42:42,948 --> 01:42:44,865
I thought you were spot-on.

1598
01:42:47,202 --> 01:42:48,410
My turn.

1599
01:42:59,047 --> 01:43:00,923
<I>Hold on to that phone.

1600
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:10,808
This is Sosa.

1601
01:43:10,892 --> 01:43:12,268
<i>Hello, beautiful.</i>

1602
01:43:12,894 --> 01:43:14,270
Thank you.

1603
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:25,447
They got the raw end of the deal,
didn't they? Look at B.A.

1604
01:43:25,532 --> 01:43:27,658
He looks like
a huge banana.

1605
01:43:29,035 --> 01:43:30,077
Good morning, my friend.

1606
01:43:30,161 --> 01:43:31,161
Good morning.

1607
01:43:36,293 --> 01:43:38,210
Rabbi Binky Rabinowitz?

1608
01:43:41,631 --> 01:43:42,840
What passport did I give you?

1609
01:43:42,924 --> 01:43:45,384
You're from Tanzania.
My mother is from Tanzania.

1610
01:43:45,468 --> 01:43:46,969
- Oh, shit.
- What the hell happened?

1611
01:43:56,646 --> 01:43:59,356
- ... converting Africans to Judaism.
- This is station six...

1612
01:43:59,441 --> 01:44:00,482
Stuff like that.

1613
01:44:00,567 --> 01:44:03,027
Let's get ready to move.
There's three to my right.

1614
01:44:03,111 --> 01:44:04,820
There's two behind me
and one at the north-east exit.

1615
01:44:09,701 --> 01:44:10,743
Wait a sec.

1616
01:44:14,706 --> 01:44:15,998
Shalom.

1617
01:44:19,461 --> 01:44:22,838
- What's he doin'?
- It's Murdock. Telling his life story.

1618
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:27,426
There is a God.

1619
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:29,929
- You speak Swahili?
- You don't?

1620
01:44:30,513 --> 01:44:32,181
You got enough
to work with, kid?

1621
01:44:32,265 --> 01:44:33,265
We will.

1622
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:36,977
You and I have some major favors
moving across the mid-Atlantic right now.

1623
01:44:37,062 --> 01:44:40,105
It's a deep-sea freighter,
shipping strictly black-market merch.

1624
01:44:40,190 --> 01:44:41,774
How do we get out to 'er?

1625
01:44:41,858 --> 01:44:43,359
A boat. A plain old boat.

1626
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:46,195
This is what I'm talking about, Murdock.
Traveling the open seas in style.

1627
01:44:46,279 --> 01:44:49,740
This is the way I like to travel.
Classy-like. The way people used to, safe.

1628
01:44:49,824 --> 01:44:50,908
- Yeah...
- We don't need a plane.

1629
01:44:50,992 --> 01:44:54,203
You know, Bosco, hopefully one day
we'll get you over your fear of flyin'.

1630
01:44:54,287 --> 01:44:55,371
What?

1631
01:44:56,915 --> 01:44:58,123
Hey, that ain't a boat!

1632
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:01,710
Just not today.

1633
01:45:02,796 --> 01:45:04,546
Murdock, don't you remember
what I said?

1634
01:45:04,631 --> 01:45:06,298
- I said you have to catch him...
- You have to catch him...

1635
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:08,467
- ... after you inject 'im.
- ... after you inject 'im.

1636
01:45:10,762 --> 01:45:11,804
My bad.

1637
01:45:38,581 --> 01:45:41,375
Oh! Damn it!
My head, man.

1638
01:45:45,422 --> 01:45:49,466
- Coconut-curry tamponade, your favorite.
- Give me that, fool.

1639
01:45:49,884 --> 01:45:51,927
You get them toast points?

1640
01:45:52,345 --> 01:45:54,513
Voila. Toast points.

1641
01:45:56,933 --> 01:45:59,226
Y'all knocked me out
again, huh?

1642
01:45:59,310 --> 01:46:03,188
Okay, now, the whole injection,
knockin' out,

1643
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:05,691
Hannibal and Face.

1644
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:08,819
The curry tamponade... Murdock.

1645
01:46:09,112 --> 01:46:11,905
Why do I feel
like I fell on my face?

1646
01:46:12,407 --> 01:46:14,116
Huh? Tell me that.

1647
01:46:16,202 --> 01:46:17,202
Uh...

1648
01:46:18,329 --> 01:46:19,663
Lynch is a paradox.

1649
01:46:19,748 --> 01:46:21,623
Murdock, you done with that?

1650
01:46:21,708 --> 01:46:26,211
This is a guy who needs anonymity,
but he loves theatricality.

1651
01:46:27,756 --> 01:46:30,215
He's an administrator,
he's not an operator.

1652
01:46:33,595 --> 01:46:34,970
Where is it?

1653
01:46:36,806 --> 01:46:38,015
Very nice.

1654
01:46:38,767 --> 01:46:41,769
So he stays as far away
from the point of impact as possible,

1655
01:46:41,853 --> 01:46:44,188
and never gets his hands dirty
if he can help it.

1656
01:46:44,272 --> 01:46:45,814
But we're gonna
change all that.

1657
01:46:45,899 --> 01:46:47,566
You can't hustle
a hustler, fool.

1658
01:46:50,361 --> 01:46:54,073
No sparks, no flames,
not even a flashlight near this stuff.

1659
01:46:54,157 --> 01:46:55,657
Easy, easy.

1660
01:46:56,826 --> 01:46:59,912
This guy is never
at the flashpoint of anything.

1661
01:47:02,665 --> 01:47:05,209
He's safe and sound somewhere,
pulling the strings.

1662
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:08,378
<i>Mama. Mama.</i>

1663
01:47:08,671 --> 01:47:10,756
Hey, boss. Why so many
of these damn things anyway?

1664
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:13,884
Because overkill
is underrated, my friend.

1665
01:47:16,012 --> 01:47:19,264
So we're gonna bring this guy
down to ground level.

1666
01:47:19,349 --> 01:47:20,724
<i>Mama. Mama.</i>

1667
01:47:20,809 --> 01:47:23,102
This way, Lynch. Lynch.

1668
01:47:24,187 --> 01:47:26,730
The last place
he'd ever wanna be.

1669
01:47:29,192 --> 01:47:33,028
Then you put him on display
for the whole world to see.

1670
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:35,531
Any questions?

1671
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:40,244
What's up, boss man?

1672
01:47:40,411 --> 01:47:41,703
Hey, B.A.

1673
01:47:41,788 --> 01:47:44,081
It's gonna get heavy, isn't it?

1674
01:47:45,875 --> 01:47:48,377
Well, I can't promise you
it won't.

1675
01:47:49,212 --> 01:47:51,588
Let me read you something
real quick.

1676
01:47:51,673 --> 01:47:55,717
"Victory attained by violence
is tantamount to defeat,"

1677
01:47:56,970 --> 01:47:58,679
"for it is momentary."

1678
01:48:00,265 --> 01:48:01,473
Gandhi.

1679
01:48:02,392 --> 01:48:06,311
"It is better to be violent
if there is violence in our hearts,"

1680
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:09,731
"than to put on the cloak of
non-violence to cover impotence."

1681
01:48:12,318 --> 01:48:13,819
Who said that?

1682
01:48:14,237 --> 01:48:15,445
Same guy.

1683
01:48:16,573 --> 01:48:19,992
Gandhi wasn't afraid to fight
for the things he believed in.

1684
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:23,245
What is it you believe in, B.A.?

1685
01:48:41,097 --> 01:48:46,351
For life is but an opera...

1686
01:48:49,814 --> 01:48:51,315
It's off, isn't it?

1687
01:48:52,442 --> 01:48:53,442
I think it's higher.

1688
01:48:57,071 --> 01:48:58,071
No, it's good.
It's not that, Murdock.

1689
01:48:58,156 --> 01:48:59,615
Face, what's wrong?
Come on, man.

1690
01:49:00,283 --> 01:49:02,993
I don't know, man.
I'm just thinking past this.

1691
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:07,247
This is so... you know,
we've always come back alive,

1692
01:49:07,332 --> 01:49:11,043
the four of us...
cause of the old man.

1693
01:49:11,127 --> 01:49:12,461
- I know.
- I'm not him.

1694
01:49:12,545 --> 01:49:14,129
Face, I know this.

1695
01:49:14,214 --> 01:49:16,340
Murdock, I'm not Hannibal.

1696
01:49:18,301 --> 01:49:20,969
Who has the most
to lose on this, Face?

1697
01:49:21,387 --> 01:49:22,512
Me.

1698
01:49:24,307 --> 01:49:25,474
And I trust you.

1699
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:28,192
Yeah, I know,

1700
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:32,147
but, uh... you're crazy.

1701
01:49:36,986 --> 01:49:38,487
Not that crazy.

1702
01:49:56,589 --> 01:49:58,173
<i>Our eagles
may have landed.</i>

1703
01:49:58,258 --> 01:49:59,383
<i>Everybody ready to roll?</i>

1704
01:49:59,467 --> 01:50:00,759
<i>Copy. Team 1 on the move.</i>

1705
01:50:00,843 --> 01:50:02,552
<i>Acknowledged.
Team 2 in route.</i>

1706
01:50:09,519 --> 01:50:12,312
All right, guys.
Everybody ready?

1707
01:50:13,147 --> 01:50:14,856
Curtain's about to come up.

1708
01:50:16,985 --> 01:50:18,318
Show time.

1709
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:25,784
That's Smith right there.
Watch him.

1710
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:29,663
<i>Ground team's in position?</i>

1711
01:50:29,747 --> 01:50:31,164
<i>Standing by.</i>

1712
01:50:32,667 --> 01:50:33,792
In position.

1713
01:50:36,337 --> 01:50:38,046
Shoot Team 1, affirmative.

1714
01:50:38,214 --> 01:50:39,881
Spotter 1. 10-8.

1715
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:42,259
Let's chattermark
on comms for now.

1716
01:50:42,343 --> 01:50:45,053
Morrison's the primary tango.
Plates are the package.

1717
01:50:47,056 --> 01:50:48,140
Yeah.

1718
01:50:48,891 --> 01:50:51,685
<i>Okay, okay, he's talking to Sosa.
I want this call.</i>

1719
01:50:51,853 --> 01:50:53,687
You lied to me, Sosa.
We had a deal.

1720
01:50:53,771 --> 01:50:55,856
I want that goddamn call
in my... Thank you.

1721
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:58,108
<i>We had a deal,
but I'm changing the deal.</i>

1722
01:50:58,318 --> 01:51:00,193
<i>Are you kiddin' me, Sosa?
Are you kiddin' me?</i>

1723
01:51:00,278 --> 01:51:03,280
<i>This is a complicated exchange
and you have no play here.</i>

1724
01:51:03,364 --> 01:51:05,490
<i>Listen, or remain
at-large fugitives</i>

1725
01:51:05,575 --> 01:51:07,659
<i>- for the foreseeable future.
- Uh-oh. No! No, no.</i>

1726
01:51:07,744 --> 01:51:10,078
For God sakes, I've got
Morrison here and the plates.

1727
01:51:10,455 --> 01:51:12,581
<i>I'm exposed, Sosa. Exposed!</i>

1728
01:51:12,665 --> 01:51:14,333
<i>We're not doin' this
on the docks.</i>

1729
01:51:14,417 --> 01:51:16,043
Now listen to me,
we're not turning ourselves in.

1730
01:51:16,127 --> 01:51:18,670
Now you listen to me,
we're not turning ourselves in.

1731
01:51:18,755 --> 01:51:21,089
<i>I need you to do it on my terms
or nothing at all.</i>

1732
01:51:21,174 --> 01:51:23,008
<i>To hell with that,
and to hell with you, Sosa!</i>

1733
01:51:23,092 --> 01:51:24,217
Ah. She burned him.

1734
01:51:24,302 --> 01:51:27,846
<i>Face, B.A., we're buggin' out.
Sosa's jammed us.</i>

1735
01:51:28,097 --> 01:51:30,891
Murdock, get the chopper
down here in 10.

1736
01:51:33,311 --> 01:51:34,353
<i>Okay, he's moving him.</i>

1737
01:51:34,437 --> 01:51:35,685
<i>You got 'im?
He's moving 'im.</i>

1738
01:51:35,685 --> 01:51:37,481
For the love of God, relax.

1739
01:51:37,774 --> 01:51:39,775
<i>I am relaxed.
He's moving him.</i>

1740
01:51:39,859 --> 01:51:41,735
Don't do this.
Hannibal, please.

1741
01:51:41,819 --> 01:51:44,863
- There. That's Morrison, right there. Take him.
- Wait, does he have the plates?

1742
01:51:44,947 --> 01:51:46,365
Smith has the plates.
Go now.

1743
01:51:46,449 --> 01:51:49,159
- Take him, he's right there. Do it.
- I've got Morrison, taking a shot.

1744
01:51:51,746 --> 01:51:54,247
<i>A little too close for comfort, kid.</i>

1745
01:51:54,457 --> 01:51:55,624
What just happened?

1746
01:51:55,708 --> 01:51:57,167
What the hell is he doin'?

1747
01:51:57,627 --> 01:51:59,294
<i>Where are they?
Somebody talk to me.</i>

1748
01:51:59,379 --> 01:52:01,338
<i>Come on, did that thing
crush them or what?</i>

1749
01:52:02,507 --> 01:52:06,051
This was a hell of a lot easier
when it was just three plastic cups.

1750
01:52:09,722 --> 01:52:13,183
<i>Everybody just be cool.
Pay attention. No hasty moves.</i>

1751
01:52:14,727 --> 01:52:18,313
<i>So, you beat a guy like Lynch
by drawin' him in with three things.</i>

1752
01:52:18,815 --> 01:52:20,315
What the hell are they doin'?

1753
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:21,525
<i>Distraction.</i>

1754
01:52:24,153 --> 01:52:26,863
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What is happening?

1755
01:52:28,699 --> 01:52:30,075
<i>Diversion.</i>

1756
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:37,124
This is a diversion!
Stay eagle on those containers.

1757
01:52:38,334 --> 01:52:40,001
<i>Breaking for the exits!
Open fire!</i>

1758
01:52:40,086 --> 01:52:41,837
Do not engage! Back off!

1759
01:52:42,004 --> 01:52:43,588
<i>Ground teams, engage!</i>

1760
01:52:47,343 --> 01:52:48,760
Holy shit!

1761
01:52:54,392 --> 01:52:55,851
<i>Ground team, re-engage.</i>

1762
01:52:56,018 --> 01:52:57,602
<i>You are being
played by Smith.</i>

1763
01:52:57,687 --> 01:53:00,564
<i>He's tryin' to draw your eye line, Lynch.
Come on, be smart.</i>

1764
01:53:00,648 --> 01:53:01,857
Take them! Take them!
Take them! Take them!

1765
01:53:04,902 --> 01:53:08,280
Contact! Tower house and bow!
It's Peck and Baracus!

1766
01:53:15,079 --> 01:53:16,163
<i>And division.</i>

1767
01:53:17,999 --> 01:53:20,250
It's a trap! Pull back! Pull back!

1768
01:53:20,334 --> 01:53:22,085
- Get the hell outta there!
- No, no, no.

1769
01:53:28,551 --> 01:53:30,719
What is happening?
What is going on?

1770
01:53:31,262 --> 01:53:32,554
<i>Nice one, kid.</i>

1771
01:53:32,722 --> 01:53:34,264
<i>It's Peck and Baracus!</i>

1772
01:53:34,348 --> 01:53:35,932
- Shoot them!
- Shut up! I know what I'm doing.

1773
01:53:36,017 --> 01:53:38,727
Okay, paintballers,
time to go pro.

1774
01:53:41,898 --> 01:53:43,607
B.A., get to
your secondary position.

1775
01:53:45,693 --> 01:53:47,235
Okay. Game-changer.

1776
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:50,238
Here's what I think
of your best-laid plans.

1777
01:53:52,408 --> 01:53:53,408
Shit!

1778
01:53:57,371 --> 01:53:58,705
Jesus Christ!

1779
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:01,458
So much for
the grand scheme, Smith.

1780
01:54:01,584 --> 01:54:02,667
What the hell was that?

1781
01:54:02,752 --> 01:54:04,544
<i>Face, what the hell was that?</i>

1782
01:54:04,629 --> 01:54:07,672
<i>Pike hit the ship with a SMAW!
He punched a hole in the hull!</i>

1783
01:54:07,757 --> 01:54:09,174
What about the plan?

1784
01:54:09,258 --> 01:54:11,718
Pike just blew up the plan!
We are ad-libbing!

1785
01:54:11,802 --> 01:54:13,178
Bosco, get out o' there!

1786
01:54:13,262 --> 01:54:14,596
I'm goin' for Hannibal.

1787
01:54:15,681 --> 01:54:17,599
- Cover me. I'm going for those plates.
- Yes, sir.

1788
01:54:22,104 --> 01:54:24,898
The boat is going over!
Get outta there!

1789
01:54:24,982 --> 01:54:26,441
Boss, hang on!

1790
01:56:11,547 --> 01:56:13,173
Oh! Jeez!

1791
01:56:15,384 --> 01:56:16,468
Shit.

1792
01:56:16,552 --> 01:56:19,929
<i>Bosco, Pike's got the high ground.
I'm running low on ammo, man.</i>

1793
01:56:32,318 --> 01:56:33,568
Shit!

1794
01:56:33,736 --> 01:56:35,904
How you doin', 
handsome?

1795
01:56:36,197 --> 01:56:38,657
Shit, can you cycle
that weapon. Nice work.

1796
01:56:38,741 --> 01:56:40,617
Jeez, close friends and bullets.

1797
01:56:40,701 --> 01:56:42,077
Where are they
when you need 'em?

1798
01:56:45,331 --> 01:56:48,124
Don't take this too personally,
but, uh, look here,

1799
01:56:48,751 --> 01:56:51,002
smile, wait for the flash.

1800
01:56:54,423 --> 01:56:55,674
Baracus.

1801
01:57:06,394 --> 01:57:08,687
Bosco!

1802
01:57:21,283 --> 01:57:22,492
Lynch.

1803
01:57:26,038 --> 01:57:31,543
Lynch.

1804
01:57:34,338 --> 01:57:35,880
Come on, Lynch.

1805
01:57:39,719 --> 01:57:40,885
Lynch.

1806
01:57:43,514 --> 01:57:45,974
Come on, Smith!
Stop bullshittin'.

1807
01:57:46,434 --> 01:57:48,727
Lynch.
Come on, Lynch.

1808
01:57:53,232 --> 01:57:54,482
Lynch...

1809
01:57:55,151 --> 01:57:56,526
Where am I?

1810
01:57:59,697 --> 01:58:01,239
Come on, Lynch.

1811
01:58:04,076 --> 01:58:05,285
Lynch.

1812
01:58:06,036 --> 01:58:07,954
Where am I, Lynch?

1813
01:58:09,457 --> 01:58:11,124
Come on, Lynch.

1814
01:58:11,208 --> 01:58:14,377
Lynch, Lynch, Lynch, Lynch.

1815
01:58:15,921 --> 01:58:17,255
Lynch!

1816
01:58:31,761 --> 01:58:36,107
Whoo! There you are, Hannibal.
Lookin' all over for you.

1817
01:58:37,109 --> 01:58:39,277
Hey, don't let the scarf fool you.

1818
01:58:39,361 --> 01:58:43,448
My muay Thai is pretty good.
My jujitsu is a little better, but, uh...

1819
01:58:43,616 --> 01:58:47,531
You had this whole... sleight-of-hand thing
going with the containers

1820
01:58:47,531 --> 01:58:50,955
and... the cars, and the fireworks.
"Lynch, Lynch, Lynch!"

1821
01:58:52,249 --> 01:58:57,128
God, that's annoying.
But you give Pike a rocket.

1822
01:58:58,464 --> 01:59:00,548
There's your monkey wrench.

1823
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,050
Hannibal, don't do this.

1824
01:59:02,134 --> 01:59:06,387
You know, Smith, you could have
the best... recipe in the world...

1825
01:59:06,472 --> 01:59:08,348
- You owe me that much.
- ... but you drop a few bullets

1826
01:59:08,432 --> 01:59:10,058
- into the batter...
- Hannibal, don't do this.

1827
01:59:10,142 --> 01:59:12,310
- Lynch, no!
- Hannibal, please.

1828
01:59:12,394 --> 01:59:13,728
Oh, God.

1829
01:59:15,564 --> 01:59:17,607
... and that cake don't bake.

1830
01:59:17,691 --> 01:59:21,402
Uh-oh. Your witness,
your gun, your problem.

1831
01:59:24,615 --> 01:59:27,367
You served your country well.
Excuse me.

1832
01:59:32,780 --> 01:59:36,042
Well. Hello, Ben,
where have you been all my life?

1833
01:59:38,254 --> 01:59:41,339
Look at us, Hannibal.
Couple of grown men.

1834
01:59:41,549 --> 01:59:43,883
I'm bleeding.
You're bleeding.

1835
01:59:44,051 --> 01:59:46,719
Don't get up.

1836
01:59:53,102 --> 01:59:54,769
Goddamn it!

1837
01:59:55,312 --> 01:59:58,147
Your muay Thai is as bad
as your jujitsu, Lynch.

1838
02:00:00,109 --> 02:00:02,068
Better stick with a gun.

1839
02:00:02,152 --> 02:00:05,405
You put a loaded weapon in my hand,
I'll put a bullet in your head.

1840
02:00:21,463 --> 02:00:23,798
I told you
I would shoot you.

1841
02:00:25,050 --> 02:00:26,968
Kevlar saved your life.

1842
02:00:27,303 --> 02:00:30,138
Thing is, it doesn't do much good
if I pop you in the head.

1843
02:00:30,222 --> 02:00:32,348
It does
if you melt it down.

1844
02:00:33,976 --> 02:00:35,518
Hannibal, don't do this.

1845
02:00:35,603 --> 02:00:37,770
<i>- Hannibal, please.
- So, you beat a guy like that</i>

1846
02:00:37,855 --> 02:00:39,814
<i>by drawing him in
with three things.</i>

1847
02:00:40,399 --> 02:00:42,901
<i>- Distraction.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! What is happening?</i>

1848
02:00:42,985 --> 02:00:44,485
<i>Diversion.</i>

1849
02:00:44,987 --> 02:00:46,112
<i>And division.</i>

1850
02:00:49,575 --> 02:00:50,742
<i>Hannibal,
don't leave me alive.</i>

1851
02:00:50,826 --> 02:00:53,828
<i>Then you put him on display
for the whole world to see.</i>

1852
02:00:57,249 --> 02:00:58,625
What the...

1853
02:01:13,223 --> 02:01:14,641
That's good.

1854
02:01:17,019 --> 02:01:18,269
Surprise.

1855
02:01:19,855 --> 02:01:20,855
Agent Burress.

1856
02:01:22,066 --> 02:01:23,691
What did you call me?

1857
02:01:24,526 --> 02:01:26,569
Agent Vance Burress?
Isn't that your name?

1858
02:01:26,654 --> 02:01:29,197
At least that's the name
I've got on this warrant here,

1859
02:01:29,281 --> 02:01:33,451
and unless you have a...
piece of paper that looks exactly like...

1860
02:01:34,161 --> 02:01:35,578
That's funny.
That's what I said.

1861
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:37,205
She's quotin' me.

1862
02:01:37,456 --> 02:01:39,165
Easy, easy.

1863
02:01:41,377 --> 02:01:43,252
You're under arrest
for attempted murder,

1864
02:01:43,337 --> 02:01:45,296
violations of
the Civil False Claims Act,

1865
02:01:45,381 --> 02:01:48,883
and the theft of top secret
government engraving plates.

1866
02:01:49,218 --> 02:01:50,385
Easy.

1867
02:01:53,180 --> 02:01:55,139
I guess the plan went okay,

1868
02:01:55,224 --> 02:01:58,810
considering Pike did blow up the boat,
which I didn't account for at all.

1869
02:01:58,894 --> 02:02:00,895
Bullets didn't go through.

1870
02:02:01,897 --> 02:02:03,606
<i>Hannibal, don't do this.
Hannibal, please.</i>

1871
02:02:03,691 --> 02:02:05,692
How you feeling, man?

1872
02:02:05,943 --> 02:02:07,402
Not... Not good.

1873
02:02:07,486 --> 02:02:09,529
- What's wrong?
- Not good.

1874
02:02:10,030 --> 02:02:11,781
I feel sane.

1875
02:02:12,074 --> 02:02:14,325
I should have shot you
in the head a long time ago.

1876
02:02:14,535 --> 02:02:17,161
Is it crazy that I'm feeling
your anxiety right now?

1877
02:02:17,246 --> 02:02:18,246
Do I look anxious to you?

1878
02:02:19,248 --> 02:02:20,248
You think I'm beaten?

1879
02:02:21,458 --> 02:02:23,584
I'm bleeding,
I'm not sweating.

1880
02:02:23,794 --> 02:02:26,713
Let's take him out of here, guys.
Go ahead, princess.

1881
02:02:30,718 --> 02:02:34,470
What's the difference between
a concussion and a contusion?

1882
02:02:35,472 --> 02:02:38,015
- It don't matter, bro. You tore up.
- Murdock, that was beautiful.

1883
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:39,684
You were right.
The helmet worked.

1884
02:02:39,768 --> 02:02:41,769
Ketchup worked great.

1885
02:02:42,479 --> 02:02:44,689
You did a great job. You okay?

1886
02:02:44,773 --> 02:02:45,940
- Yeah.
- Got your bell rung?

1887
02:02:46,024 --> 02:02:49,694
Just let Hannibal...
make the plans next time.

1888
02:02:50,195 --> 02:02:52,321
- Oh. Okay.
- Okay?

1889
02:02:52,656 --> 02:02:54,282
How's the conscience, big guy?

1890
02:02:55,993 --> 02:02:57,285
At peace.

1891
02:03:07,463 --> 02:03:09,088
Keep it turnin'.

1892
02:03:09,965 --> 02:03:11,340
We already got them
on the exits.

1893
02:03:11,425 --> 02:03:14,010
- We got a two-mile no-fly zone here.
- Which one of you is Sosa?

1894
02:03:14,094 --> 02:03:15,678
- I am. I am.
- I need to talk to Sosa.

1895
02:03:15,763 --> 02:03:17,513
As of right now your prisoner
is to be remanded

1896
02:03:17,598 --> 02:03:19,432
- into federal custody.
- I have a warrant for this man.

1897
02:03:19,516 --> 02:03:22,101
- As of right now...
- I'll tell you what... I'm a doc.

1898
02:03:22,186 --> 02:03:23,686
Let me doctor you up.
Let me help you out.

1899
02:03:23,771 --> 02:03:26,022
Do you need stitches?
Please tell me you need stitches.

1900
02:03:26,106 --> 02:03:27,523
I can stitch you up
really good.

1901
02:03:29,151 --> 02:03:30,485
Gentlemen.

1902
02:03:32,654 --> 02:03:33,988
The Central Intelligence Agency

1903
02:03:34,072 --> 02:03:36,407
believes in and evinces
a profound moral ethic,

1904
02:03:36,492 --> 02:03:38,743
as well as an unshakeable
professional standard.

1905
02:03:38,827 --> 02:03:42,997
As such, we would like to extend
our most sincere apologies

1906
02:03:43,081 --> 02:03:44,499
for what's happened here.

1907
02:03:45,918 --> 02:03:48,795
- Good day and God bless.
- Where are you taking 'im?

1908
02:03:51,507 --> 02:03:52,590
Who?

1909
02:03:57,763 --> 02:03:59,347
I never got your name.

1910
02:04:01,934 --> 02:04:03,601
My name is Lynch.

1911
02:04:05,479 --> 02:04:07,063
Of course it is.

1912
02:04:09,650 --> 02:04:11,025
Did he just say Lynch?

1913
02:04:15,447 --> 02:04:16,781
Let it go.

1914
02:04:23,288 --> 02:04:24,497
Hey. Don't touch me.

1915
02:04:25,332 --> 02:04:26,624
Take it easy, guys.

1916
02:04:26,708 --> 02:04:29,377
Everybody, stand down!
Stand down!

1917
02:04:29,461 --> 02:04:32,380
- Get those plates.
- Everybody, stand down!

1918
02:04:32,464 --> 02:04:35,216
- That's an order. Hey, you, stand down.
- What is wrong with you?

1919
02:04:35,300 --> 02:04:36,509
Lieutenant.

1920
02:04:36,593 --> 02:04:37,760
Sir, when did you arrive?
I had no idea...

1921
02:04:37,845 --> 02:04:39,720
- Just give me a minute.
- Yes, sir.

1922
02:04:41,223 --> 02:04:43,307
Get your hands
off me, tough guy.

1923
02:04:47,020 --> 02:04:50,314
Well, that's one hell of a mess.
But, uh, we did get the plates.

1924
02:04:51,733 --> 02:04:54,986
Unfortunately, I'm gonna have to charge
you all with escaping lawful custody.

1925
02:04:55,070 --> 02:04:56,779
What? Hannibal,
what is this guy talking about?

1926
02:04:56,864 --> 02:05:00,575
B.A., we were wrongly convicted,
but it's still illegal to break out of jail.

1927
02:05:00,659 --> 02:05:01,993
Director McCready,
Smith and his team

1928
02:05:02,077 --> 02:05:03,536
were instrumental
in recovering those plates.

1929
02:05:03,620 --> 02:05:07,707
They're still level-10 federal fugitives
and I need that off my desk.

1930
02:05:07,791 --> 02:05:09,792
This is chickenshit, sir.

1931
02:05:10,043 --> 02:05:12,295
Yeah, well, you know what?
Perhaps for them, it is chickenshit,

1932
02:05:12,379 --> 02:05:15,756
but for you, captain, we're
re-promoting you to your former rank.

1933
02:05:15,841 --> 02:05:17,174
So, look, they're gonna
be delivered

1934
02:05:17,259 --> 02:05:18,801
to the U.S. Marshal's Service
here in Long Beach.

1935
02:05:18,886 --> 02:05:20,720
- And there should be a C-5 transport...
- I understand, but...

1936
02:05:20,804 --> 02:05:22,096
... on the tarmac
in half an hour.

1937
02:05:22,180 --> 02:05:24,599
- This needs to be done.
- This is really unfair, sir.

1938
02:05:24,892 --> 02:05:27,351
- This is bullshit.
- I'm like Harry Houdini.

1939
02:05:27,811 --> 02:05:29,061
I chew through your cuffs.

1940
02:05:29,146 --> 02:05:31,898
- Get up. Step up. Get in there!
- Step up!

1941
02:05:31,982 --> 02:05:34,233
- Let's go. Get movin'.
- Stop. Wait, stop.

1942
02:05:34,318 --> 02:05:36,027
- Move it.
- Wait.

1943
02:05:36,612 --> 02:05:38,279
- This is so wrong.
- It got a little aggressive.

1944
02:05:38,363 --> 02:05:39,864
- Don't worry about it.
- This is really, really wrong,

1945
02:05:39,948 --> 02:05:42,450
and I'm gonna do everything
I can to fix it.

1946
02:05:42,534 --> 02:05:45,119
- I know you will.
- I'm so sorry, Face.

1947
02:06:21,114 --> 02:06:22,698
Nice plan, Face.

1948
02:06:23,241 --> 02:06:27,036
Yeah. We just traded Lynches,
and we're going back to prison.

1949
02:06:27,162 --> 02:06:29,080
We returned the plates.
We can hold our heads high.

1950
02:06:29,164 --> 02:06:30,373
We did the right thing.

1951
02:06:30,457 --> 02:06:33,626
Yeah, and look what they did to us.
This is bullshit.

1952
02:06:33,710 --> 02:06:35,878
They burned us again, Hannibal.

1953
02:06:36,004 --> 02:06:38,798
We trusted the system
and it turned on us.

1954
02:06:38,882 --> 02:06:42,009
Remember, boys, no matter
how random things might appear,

1955
02:06:42,094 --> 02:06:44,637
there is still a plan. Kid.

1956
02:06:45,514 --> 02:06:49,350
Well, I don't mean
to steal your line, boss, but, uh...

1957
02:06:56,692 --> 02:06:59,610
- Yeah.
- I love when a plan comes together.

1958
02:07:05,158 --> 02:07:06,742
<i>Still wanted
by the government,</i>

1959
02:07:07,285 --> 02:07:09,954
<i>they survive
as soldiers of fortune.</i>

1960
02:07:12,165 --> 02:07:14,250
<i>If you have a problem,</i>

1961
02:07:15,252 --> 02:07:17,253
<i>if no one else can help,</i>

1962
02:07:18,213 --> 02:07:20,214
<i>and if you can find them,</i>

1963
02:07:20,424 --> 02:07:22,216
<i>maybe you can hire...</i>

1964
02:07:24,803 --> 02:07:26,262
<i>the A-Team.</i>
