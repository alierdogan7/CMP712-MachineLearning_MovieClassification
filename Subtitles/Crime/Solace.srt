1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:09,341
(monitor beeping steadily)

2
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,812
(sobbing)

3
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:22,081
- Cuban.
- What's the word, Sawyer?

4
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,003
SAWYER: Looks like a match.

5
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,550
JOE: Yeah, it's Joe.
We've got a series.

6
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,595
Same M.O.,
same signature, no DNA.

7
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,890
Not one goddamn shred.

8
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,227
You said that already.
I'm doing everything I can.

9
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,104
(phone beeps)

10
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,439
Goddamn fucking asshole.

11
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,944
- (water trickling)
- (under breath) Fuck.

12
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,413
I need to go see him.

13
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,375
Joe.

14
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,215
I think it's a mistake.

15
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,552
You're entitled to your own opinion.

16
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,554
Well, let me rephrase that.

17
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,639
I think it's a big mistake.

18
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,893
Apart from time and resources,
it's bringing an unknown into a...

19
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,855
- into a really bad situation.
- Not unknown at all.

20
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,275
I've worked with him before,
and he's actually my friend.

21
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,111
- You said he's unstable.
- I did not, Katherine.

22
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,655
I said he's had a hard time.

23
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,702
It's too early
for a Hail Mary, Joe.

24
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:48,333
You will learn it's never too early
for one of those.

25
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,294
(siren wailing in distance)

26
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,920
(footsteps)

27
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,388
JOE:
Goddamn, are you seeing this?

28
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,017
I mean, look at all this...
pretty green shit.

29
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,899
How long has
he lived out here?

30
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,403
Two years.
Ever since his daughter Emma died.

31
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,989
Leukemia. In his arms.

32
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:30,125
Gave up his medical practice.
Hell, he gave up everything.

33
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,342
What happened to his wife?

34
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,139
Well, therein lies
the truth about tragedies.

35
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,184
They bring some people
closer together...

36
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,312
...drives others apart.

37
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,955
JOE: There it is.

38
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,965
Do you mind staying here?
Let me talk to him alone?

39
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,717
- You could have left me in the city.
- I could've...

40
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:24,012
But you would have missed
the pretty green shit.

41
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,889
(car bleeps)

42
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,936
Sentiment.

43
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,240
(creaking)

44
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,499
JOHN: Yeah?

45
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,088
- John? It's Joe.
- JOHN: Yeah, I know.

46
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,344
Are you gonna open the door?
I'd like to talk to you.

47
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,054
JOHN: Not interested.

48
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,850
John, I just drove three hours
to come and see you.

49
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:14,354
Come on. You know me well enough
to know that I'm not leaving.

50
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,149
And I'll kick down this door
if I have to.

51
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,409
JOHN: A real pain in the ass.

52
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,288
Yeah. I've heard that before.

53
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:46,386
You know, I sent you a letter
like a year ago. Did you get it?

54
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,722
- (liquid pouring)
- Yep.

55
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,017
What did it say, John?

56
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,023
"No parent should
outlive a child."

57
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,794
- So you've been holed up here.
- Uh-huh.

58
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,381
I see you've settled in.

59
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,806
- It's a beautiful day out there.
- That's what they tell me.

60
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,934
So you don't get out much?

61
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,583
(phone rings)

62
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,963
- Do you want a soda?
- JOE: No, thank you.

63
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,673
I don't have cigarettes.

64
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,716
I gave them up a few months ago.

65
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,718
Meet my new addiction.

66
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,806
Laura and the kid okay?

67
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,142
Yeah, they're good.
Thank you.

68
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,477
Heard from Elizabeth yet?

69
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,020
No.

70
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,523
You will.

71
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,236
So, besides wanting
to see you...

72
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,575
I've got a situation that
I'd like you to take a look at.

73
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,996
- I could just tell you about the victims.
- I'm not interested.

74
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,457
By the way,
who's your girlfriend?

75
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,589
That is my loyal partner,
Agent Cowles,

76
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:49,009
who apparently doesn't listen
to a fucking word I say.

77
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,844
KATHERINE: S.A.C., Joe.

78
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,848
I thought you might
want to take the call.

79
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,558
Excuse me, John.

80
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,403
- Hi.
- Hi.

81
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,449
- I brought the case files.
- It wasn't necessary.

82
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,660
The Agency has
changed the guidelines

83
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,246
for the way we break down
the cases.

84
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,332
It makes them more readable.

85
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,334
Oh. Well, that's a relief.

86
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,921
We gotta go.

87
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,054
Three murders.
Identical M.O.

88
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,181
JOE: Agent Cowles.

89
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,149
(high-pitched distortion)

90
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,986
I'll leave the case files here.

91
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,577
John.

92
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,830
You okay?

93
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:05,043
If you change your mind
about this...

94
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,505
...you know where to find me.

95
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:17,138
(opera music plays)

96
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,152
(distorted conversation)

97
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,488
(distorted screaming)

98
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,709
(opera music continues)

99
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,266
(hums)

100
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,152
(hums along to music)

101
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,700
(crescendo)

102
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,966
(opera music continues)

103
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,615
(whirring)

104
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,479
- JOHN: Hey, Joe.
- JOE: John.

105
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,190
I make no promises.

106
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:36,277
I'll stay maybe one day.
Maybe one week.

107
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,697
Deal. No promises.

108
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,118
- You knew I'd come back?
- I had high hopes.

109
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:47,414
You remember Agent Cowles?
I should say "Dr." Cowles,

110
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,625
- with a doctorate in...?
- Psychopathology.

111
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,754
She was to become a professor
before the bureau snagged her.

112
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:59,008
- You gave up academia for this madhouse?
- They let me carry a gun.

113
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,386
Wow! So sexy.

114
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,598
JOE: You two will
make a good team.

115
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:10,270
John, you know when and Katherine, you
know why someone's about to do something.

116
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,731
Run this through until we come out.

117
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,735
Dr. Clancy, before we go upstairs,
with all due respect,

118
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,739
I don't hold an ounce of confidence
in the paranormal as a field.

119
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,408
I think it's a sham.
I hope that's okay.

120
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,536
No problem at all.
I feel the same about shrinks.

121
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,038
After only one thing,
your money.

122
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,040
They'll take your whole hand.

123
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,377
Whoever said that has obviously
never met a good one.

124
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,087
It was Sigmund Freud.

125
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,173
(elevator bell dings)

126
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,136
Like I said, a hell of a team.

127
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,765
Consistency #1: method.

128
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,727
KATHERINE: Each victim was killed by
a puncture wound at the skull.

129
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,272
Inflicted by
a five-inch instrument.

130
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,275
It went straight into
the medulla oblongata.

131
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,820
Immediate, according to the coroner.
Painless execution.

132
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:06,284
- JOHN: These photos are all post-mortem.
- A couple of them almost look alive.

133
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,953
KATHERINE: Consistency #2:
No mistakes.

134
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:15,210
Crime scenes so far have yielded
no evidence of DNA, hair-fibers,

135
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,129
- shoe-prints, nothing.
- No witnesses, either.

136
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,925
Ward lived in a secured building.
No signs of forced entry.

137
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:28,014
On the psych front, it's unheard of.
There's no geographical, chronological

138
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,892
or astrological pattern
to the murder.

139
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,268
No robbery.

140
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,898
JOE: Other than that,
we got a good handle on this case.

141
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,858
- (distortion)
- (high-pitched tone)

142
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,529
John?

143
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,323
John.

144
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,242
Yeah.

145
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,913
Robert Ellis,
the kid in Mount Pleasant.

146
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,166
- JOHN: He was eating ice cream.
- He was.

147
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,255
Where do you want to start,
John?

148
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,549
Well...

149
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,760
- ...at the beginning?
- (door opens)

150
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:16,020
The residence of
Mrs. Ethel Jackson, age 69.

151
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,358
She lived alone with three cats.
Was a regular at church.

152
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:25,029
Landlady grew suspicious when she
hadn't seen or talked to her in two days.

153
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,907
She was found killed
in that rocking chair.

154
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,035
On the TV,
the Cooking Channel played.

155
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,163
And the note we were looking at earlier?

156
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,916
Was here.
On this table.

157
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,168
(phone rings)

158
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,130
My wife.
I need to take this.

159
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,340
Sweetheart, I...

160
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,306
- What do you make of the note?
- As a shrink?

161
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,100
- Yeah.
- It's a classic riddle.

162
00:14:55,477 --> 00:15:00,315
"I will tell you in two words who I am,
what I do and how I live. May I?"

163
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,652
KATHERINE: Taunting questions
designed to mislead.

164
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:09,532
Asking our permission to reveal himself,
yet never intending to.

165
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:16,664
It's playful, but only one person
is playing here. It's solitaire.

166
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,711
Or is it something more?

167
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,880
Is it a cry for help?

168
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,966
An indication of
split personality disorder,

169
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,261
where the riddler is
asking themselves, and us,

170
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,724
who they actually are? But no.
That's not consistent with the crime.

171
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,977
This is too controlled,
too sharp.

172
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,563
There's something else
going on here.

173
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,610
It's like he's looking for
someone.

174
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,446
(clattering)

175
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,751
- So?
- She likes hats.

176
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,214
Hey. How are we doing?

177
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,632
JOHN: Fantastic.

178
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,137
(blows)

179
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,727
Katherine works up a full
profile based on the note.

180
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:23,606
- Which she's finishing at home.
- JOHN: Okay.

181
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,025
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Yes.

182
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,027
John.

183
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,407
How about I buy you dinner?
Special treat. Best place in town.

184
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,783
Do I need a jacket?

185
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:38,204
Hell, no, you don't. I got connections.
I know the maître d'.

186
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,876
Goddamn it.
This is so good!

187
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,045
- John?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

188
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,090
- For John, one more please. Yeah?
- VENDOR: Coming up.

189
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,553
My boy has a rough time in school.
Came home in tears again today.

190
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,346
- Being bullied?
- Yeah.

191
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,056
I don't know what to do.

192
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,644
Don't know. Give him a hug.
Tell him a joke.

193
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,189
- A joke?
- Yeah. A joke.

194
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:09,027
I don't know any jokes.
I'm serious, John. Come on.

195
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,863
In the name of friendship,
tell me a joke.

196
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,407
Me?
I don't know any jokes.

197
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,367
Okay, just one. Um...

198
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,204
This woman, Mrs. Jones, uh,

199
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,291
was suffering from
a rare heart condition.

200
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:28,588
The doctor prescribes male hormones
to up her testosterone, 2 pills a day.

201
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,841
A month later
she goes back to the doctor and says...

202
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,969
"That medicine
is doing wonders for my heart.

203
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,806
But I'm growing hair
where it has never grown before."

204
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:44,228
"Don't worry, excessive hair is to be
expected. Where does it grow exactly?"

205
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,564
She says, "On my balls, Doctor."

206
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,903
It's funny, isn't it?

207
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,156
I can't tell that
to my little boy.

208
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,826
- Say "testicles."
- That cleans it right up.

209
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,079
- Yeah. Biology.
- (chuckling)

210
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,790
- It's a good joke.
- Yeah.

211
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,042
I thought you'd like that.

212
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,670
Elizabeth told me
that's why she fell in love with you.

213
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,466
- Why was that?
- That smile.

214
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,803
- Oh, the smile.
- Not your joke telling.

215
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,429
(distorted, echoing thud)

216
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,269
- (thud)
- (agonized screaming)

217
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,983
John, do I have another
sandwich coming here or what?

218
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,965
JOE: Tonight, as we were
leaving Ethel Jackson's,

219
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,300
- you were onto something.
- Hmm.

220
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,432
Come on, John. Talk to me.
What do you know?

221
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,021
I want this over as quickly
and as badly as you do,

222
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,774
but you gotta tell me
what you're seeing.

223
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,484
I don't know yet.

224
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,633
- (monitor bleeping steadily)
- (sobbing)

225
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,191
John...

226
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,151
(distorted screaming)

227
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,954
MAN: John.

228
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,338
(snarling)

229
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,766
(gunshot)

230
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,102
- (knocking)
- JOE: Received an anonymous call

231
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:35,816
an hour ago offering way too specific
information about the Peter Ward murder.

232
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:41,197
Then listed a midtown address. Perimeter
is secured. They wait for us to go in.

233
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,616
(loud thud)

234
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,620
SLOMAN: Clear!

235
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,539
AGENT: Clear!

236
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,007
Joe.
Take a look at this.

237
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,060
What do you think?

238
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,313
Four-sixteen. Bible verse?

239
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,524
No, it's the time.

240
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,859
Four minutes ago.

241
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,280
Four-sixteen precisely.

242
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,407
Your watch is fast.

243
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,784
Fuck. He's here.

244
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,500
(door closes)

245
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,216
(1950's pop music
plays over stereo)

246
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,476
- Are you good?
- I'm good. Go.

247
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,732
KATHERINE: Mrs. Raymond? FBI.

248
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,984
(music continues)

249
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,625
Would someone please
turn that shit off?

250
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,003
(music stops)

251
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,427
SLOMAN: Bingo.
KATHERINE: Wound on the back of the neck.

252
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:30,014
- Familiar.
- She's been dead for 5 or 6 hours.

253
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,017
- Perp must have hung around.
- He left hours ago.

254
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,441
Would you two mind
clearing the room for us please?

255
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,651
Thank you.

256
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,531
John.

257
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:53,496
JOE: Same type font as 4:16
and the note at Ethel Jackson's.

258
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,206
Mm-hmm.

259
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,459
(coughing)

260
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,003
- You okay?
- Shit.

261
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,006
- Go ahead. Take a look.
- Can I touch her?

262
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,716
Yeah.

263
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,901
- (indistinct whispering)
- David.

264
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,117
(1950's pop music plays)

265
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,369
- (door closes)
- David?

266
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,225
(music continues)

267
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,238
(music fades)

268
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,720
- (door opens)
- There you are. Come in.

269
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,931
Wash my back.

270
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,523
(slicing)

271
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,109
John?

272
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,738
- You all right?
- Yeah.

273
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,700
- What do you see?
- I'm not sure.

274
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,244
(indistinct voices in background)

275
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,836
- Okay.
- What?

276
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,341
- Don't touch the bathwater.
- Why?

277
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,176
I'm not sure why.

278
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,720
Joe? Holy shit,
we may have a suspect.

279
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,430
- Who?
- David Raymond.

280
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,516
The husband.

281
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,728
(door opens)

282
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,904
SAWYER: He says
he was at the bar all night.

283
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:35,574
His bartender and his breath
corroborate his story.

284
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,204
- JOE: Agent Cowles are you ready?
- KATHERINE: Yes, sir.

285
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,122
I want you to take the lead.

286
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,500
(she sighs)

287
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,835
- (door opens)
- (bleep)

288
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:58,222
Mr. Raymond, a cup of coffee.

289
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,184
- Been a long night for all of us.
- DAVID: Thank you.

290
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,812
If you don't mind...

291
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,732
...I'm just gonna jump
right into this. Okay?

292
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,693
- Mr. Raymond.
- Yeah?

293
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,738
We regret to inform you that
your wife Victoria

294
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,740
died last night.

295
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,286
DAVID: Jesus.

296
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,746
Jesus Christ.

297
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:29,545
Oh, God. Oh, God...
(breaks down)

298
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,089
KATHERINE: Mr. Raymond...

299
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,718
...you were seen leaving your building

300
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:39,305
last night in an agitated state.
Can you tell us why?

301
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,724
Did she leave a note?

302
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,434
Did she leave a note?

303
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,979
Mr. Raymond,
your wife was murdered.

304
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,357
- What?
- Your wife was murdered.

305
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,109
She didn't leave a note.

306
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:55,446
No! No! Oh, Jesus, God!

307
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,742
- What do you think happened?
- She didn't commit suicide?

308
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,452
Why do you think that?

309
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:06,290
The letter, I wrote... I...
I wrote a letter.

310
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,796
- This letter?
- No. What is that?

311
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,549
You didn't write this?

312
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,926
I left a letter.

313
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,428
What did it say?

314
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,391
KATHERINE: David?

315
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,694
- (distorted voices)
- (groaning)

316
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,323
"I never meant to hurt
or betray..."

317
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,953
- (groaning)
- (sobbing)

318
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,419
David?
What did the letter say?

319
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,506
He left her.

320
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,758
I was leaving her.

321
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,761
JOE: Okay.

322
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,305
JOE:
You were leaving her. Why?

323
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,724
He left her for someone else.

324
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,185
I was leaving her
for someone else.

325
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:12,898
(groaning)

326
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,903
- For another woman?
- (groaning)

327
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,327
Yes.

328
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,788
He's lying.

329
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,583
Oh, V, I'm so sorry.

330
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,339
- (groaning)
- (sobbing)

331
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,053
Uh, could I have a word with
Mr. Raymond?

332
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,680
- Dr. Clancy...
- Joe?

333
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,932
- All right.
- Thanks.

334
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,654
You're telling the truth,
or at least some of it.

335
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,908
You didn't kill your wife
did you, Mr. Raymond?

336
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:06,869
No.

337
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:12,458
But you believe the note you left
could've driven her to take her own life.

338
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:17,546
Your wife had a history of
emotional instability.

339
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:23,510
And the note was telling her that you
were leaving her for someone else.

340
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:30,517
But your note failed to mention
you were leaving her for a man.

341
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,483
- (groaning)
- (distorted voices)

342
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,821
How the fuck do you know that?

343
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:46,950
That, in fact,
you had contracted HIV.

344
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,954
Is that right?

345
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,669
(sobbing)

346
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,758
(door opens)

347
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,304
JOE: Her blood was contaminated.

348
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,432
That's why:
"Careful with the bathwater."

349
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,518
I want to see the files again.

350
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,563
It's 7:30. My family's up.
Breakfast?

351
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,273
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

352
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,359
(long beep)

353
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,076
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Laura.

354
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,204
- You need to eat.
- I'm good, baby. Thank you.

355
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,415
- Family is looking good, Joe.
- They are.

356
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,752
I try to spend as much time
as I can with them.

357
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,337
We've seen Elizabeth.

358
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,216
- Oh, yeah?
- We've kept in touch.

359
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,469
- Good.
- She still loves you, John.

360
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,143
All right. So, uh...
What do you think?

361
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:58,313
They were all
incurably sick, terminally ill.

362
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:02,317
- That is the consistency.
- We explored that. It doesn't hold up.

363
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,195
Ethel Jackson.
The wigs, the hats...

364
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,198
- She had chemotherapy.
- Three years ago.

365
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,909
She was in the clear, John.

366
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,828
No one's ever in the clear.

367
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:18,542
80 % of cancers return. Whenever they do,
they're quite difficult to eliminate.

368
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,089
So?

369
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,384
Peter Ward, it turns out,
had Lou Gehrig's Disease.

370
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,220
That can be a very slow,
painful death.

371
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:33,682
Victoria Raymond suffered
chronic suicidal depression,

372
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,186
self-destructive behavior,
cutting, overdose, and so on.

373
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,731
- LAURA: Finished breakfast?
- KEVIN: Yes!

374
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,524
Hey. Backpack!

375
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,818
KEVIN: Yes.

376
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,614
Come here, say goodbye to John.

377
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,616
- Bye-bye, John.
- Goodbye, monkey.

378
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,326
Give your dad a hug.

379
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:57,456
- Bye, Dad. See you after school.
- Yeah. Have a good day.

380
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,790
Okay.

381
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,377
- KEVIN: Have a good day at work.
- LAURA: Bye, honey.

382
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,129
- (sighs)
- (door closes)

383
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,549
Let's say I give you Ethel Jackson
and Peter Ward.

384
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,802
Two words that destroy
this whole theory:

385
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,430
The boy Robert Ellis was healthy,

386
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:17,476
and as Christian Scientists,
his parents don't believe in medicine.

387
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,311
He had no medical file.

388
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,229
- Well, let's go talk to them.
- Okay.

389
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,482
LAURA: Remember your appointment?

390
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:28,528
Right. I have a phone call with the
director at 9:00 am,

391
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:33,367
which I am immensely looking forward to.
So Katherine will take you.

392
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,077
Okay.

393
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,996
KATHERINE: Dr. Clancy...

394
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,083
How do you refer to it?

395
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,585
To what?

396
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:47,255
To, uh, what you have?

397
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,927
Is it prescience,
clairvoyance, precognition?

398
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,763
Oh, it's a hoot.
A laugh a minute.

399
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:58,141
Never mind. I'm serious.

400
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,937
What is it you see exactly?

401
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:05,023
Do you see people's futures?

402
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,193
Bits of their futures
and of their pasts.

403
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,404
It's all the same in the end.

404
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:13,615
- Is it mystical? Or religious?
- No. I'm a scientist.

405
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,576
I believe in
theoretical physics and...

406
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,954
biochemistry and that's it.

407
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:23,834
Whatever it is, I happen to get
the deluxe edition of what people now call

408
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,836
intuition or gut reaction.

409
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,882
Do you see anything now?

410
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,052
What do you mean? About you?

411
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,139
I guess so.

412
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,017
No. Nothing.

413
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,811
- At all?
- At all.

414
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,938
Just nothing.

415
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,065
JOHN: Nothing at all.

416
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,742
MR. ELLIS:
So how's the investigation going?

417
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,286
It's improving.

418
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:04,666
We believe we know why
your son was killed. Why he was chosen.

419
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:09,713
Mr. Ellis, I need to ask you a few
questions but I don't want to upset you.

420
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,133
It's all right. Ask.
If I can, I'd like to help.

421
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:19,056
Do you remember in the weeks
or months leading up to Robert's death,

422
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,100
was he at his best?
Was he healthy?

423
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,021
- Perfectly.
- He never complained of any pain?

424
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:30,484
Did he ever have trouble keeping up
with other boys at school?

425
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,944
Was he ever short of breath?

426
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:36,615
Uh... No. No.

427
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,624
- Be careful.
- I will.

428
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,254
Robert was a sculptor?

429
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,964
Yeah. He enjoys it.

430
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,968
He enjoyed it.
He had very good hands.

431
00:34:57,136 --> 00:35:00,180
(sobs)

432
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,390
KATHERINE:
I'm so sorry, Mr. Ellis.

433
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:16,071
- They're beautiful.
- Thank you.

434
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,615
What happened to this one?

435
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,744
He knocked it over
maybe a day or two before...

436
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,665
How did he knock it over?

437
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,918
I don't remember.
Kids are clumsy.

438
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,586
Robert especially?

439
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,839
Well...

440
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,968
Sometimes.
He'd upset his glass at dinner...

441
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,972
- MRS. ELLIS: You're talking to them?
- They just got here.

442
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,808
Did you catch him?

443
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,726
KATHERINE: No.

444
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:51,398
- Then what are you doing here?
- Mrs. Ellis...

445
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,067
There was another murder
last night.

446
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,237
We believe it's the same man
that killed your son.

447
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:03,076
All of the other victims have suffered
from an illness or a condition...

448
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:07,706
- Robert was 12. He wasn't sick.
- We'd like to verify that.

449
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,332
How are you going to do that?

450
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,877
KATHERINE: We conduct an autopsy.

451
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:16,131
You dig his body up, pry him open
and search around inside him?

452
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,716
JOHN: Yes, we do.

453
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,510
- Who are you?
- I'm a doctor.

454
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,346
He wasn't sick.

455
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,559
And even if he was,
he did not need a man like you.

456
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,813
It's fate.

457
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,817
It's just that some people
do not have the courage

458
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,111
to accept the wisdom of the Lord.

459
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,948
I agree with you, Mrs. Ellis, absolutely.

460
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,368
I know the limitations of medicine,

461
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:49,831
I've diagnosed many patients
with death growing inside them.

462
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,709
Like my own daughter.
She had Leukemia.

463
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,171
JOHN: For 2 years,
I went to the hospital every day

464
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,881
and watched her suffer.

465
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,927
Every procedure, every test,
all totally useless, of course.

466
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,763
And one day she died.

467
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,016
And that was that.

468
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,478
JOHN: In the end,
it was a blessing.

469
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,898
I do understand something about fate,
Mrs. Ellis.

470
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:20,278
And, uh, I certainly wouldn't use
medicine to alter God's plan.

471
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:24,324
I... just want to know
why your son was killed.

472
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,327
And medicine can help me
discover that.

473
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,372
And then, perhaps, it can
help me catch the man...

474
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,000
...who killed your little boy.

475
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,425
(loud whirring)

476
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,407
(bell rings)

477
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:09,077
FIBBIE: Dr. Clancy. Fax for you.
It's marked urgent.

478
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,793
What is it?

479
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,047
Check the cerebellar lobe.

480
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,848
PATHOLOGIST: Whoa!
What is this?

481
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,018
- Well, there's your answer.
- JOE: What?

482
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,731
Brain tumor. Size of a pea.

483
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,191
Hidden in the cerebellar lobe.

484
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,901
(bell rings)

485
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,450
- JOE: John?
- What's up, Doc?

486
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,202
Christ!

487
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,965
- JOE: John?
- JOHN: I'm out. Finished.

488
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,844
(door opens)

489
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,974
The fax?
What the hell did it say?

490
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,311
I don't know.
It was urgent and confidential.

491
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,605
Somebody trained you too well.

492
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,817
John!

493
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:26,446
Goddamn it!
You gotta let somebody in on this!

494
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:33,286
- We're walking right into a trap.
- What? You gotta talk to me.

495
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:38,291
He's way ahead of us.
And we do exactly what he wants us to do.

496
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,001
Don't you get it?

497
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,129
I'm out.

498
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,229
(thunder rumbles)

499
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,030
Doctor Clancy?

500
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,711
- Hi.
- Hi.

501
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,720
- Do you mind?
- Go ahead. You're paying for it.

502
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,689
So, we find a tumor...

503
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,358
that no one could've
known about.

504
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,902
We've established connections

505
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:52,031
between victims that, I freely admit,
I could never have seen.

506
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,660
And instead of stepping up
and leading from the front,

507
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:59,164
you run out of an autopsy,
which you asked for,

508
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,667
coincidentally,
without any explanation,

509
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:07,130
and now you're packing your bags
and you're going home.

510
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,757
Forgive me, Clancy,

511
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,177
but what the fuck?

512
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,220
Hmm.

513
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,891
"Who am I?

514
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:22,896
I will tell you in two words
who I am, what I do, and how I live."

515
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,023
What about that riddle?

516
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,150
- It's not a riddle.
- What is it?

517
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,945
"Le diro con due parole,
chi son, e che faccio, come vivo."

518
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:35,283
- It's from La Bohème by Puccini.
- So the killer is an opera nut.

519
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,911
That really helps with the profile.

520
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,621
- Thank you, Clancy.
- No.

521
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,916
I'm the nut.
I'm the opera nut.

522
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:50,632
I happened to be listening to those lines,
the very moment I read your case files.

523
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:55,220
- I... I don't get it.
- He knew I'd be listening to that music.

524
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,805
He knew that you would ask me to help.

525
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:03,478
He knew we would arrive at the
apartment at exactly 4:16 am.

526
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:08,358
Because he knows everything.

527
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:13,821
You see... He's just like me.
He sees things.

528
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,366
Only he's better at it.

529
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,910
A whole lot better.
Come, read that.

530
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,912
Come on, read it!

531
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,802
"Dr. Clancy,

532
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,392
Check the cerebellar lobe."

533
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,853
Okay.

534
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,148
So that's why you're quitting.

535
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,110
- You've met your match.
- (chuckles)

536
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,237
Oh, no.

537
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,699
No. This guy, he's way beyond me.

538
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,578
I can't stop him,
which begs a more important question.

539
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:06,916
Is he really worth stopping?
These victims, they were dying anyway.

540
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:11,087
He's not killing them out of
compulsion, or anger, or any...

541
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,631
deviant psychosis or so.

542
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:19,220
No, he's the cigar, the ice cream,
the cocktails, the flowers in the bathtub

543
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:23,057
and all that whacko stuff.
This guy is brilliant.

544
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:26,519
And he's killing them
with kindness.

545
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,940
Get it?
It's mercy killing.

546
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,109
- KATHERINE: Bullshit!
- Is it?

547
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,320
- It's murder.
- Mm-hmm.

548
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,781
That may spare
a lot of suffering.

549
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:43,578
If this was your daughter, would you
be saying the same thing, Clancy?

550
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,002
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

551
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,504
(sighs)

552
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,300
It's just...

553
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:04,182
I know your...
I know your daughter died.

554
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:10,355
But we all die someday,
don't we?

555
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,983
So what is it...

556
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:19,906
...that's so terrible
that you can't talk about?

557
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,451
Okay!

558
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,913
Here's what I'm not telling you.

559
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,667
JOHN: You lost your virginity
to a drunk stud called Bruce

560
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,336
in the back of his green
Ford Bronco at 17

561
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,713
You didn't like it very much because

562
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,340
he puked all over you.

563
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,677
5 years ago,
you had a boyfriend called Kevin.

564
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,387
No, sorry. Gavin.

565
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:45,640
A year into that
relationship you discovered

566
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,685
he thought
you were pregnant with his baby.

567
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:52,188
Gavin didn't want it
but you did, so he left you.

568
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,024
And 21/2 months later,
the baby was born.

569
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,859
A little girl, Amanda.

570
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:00,488
But one day you decided
to give her up for adoption.

571
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,407
It's breaking your heart,

572
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:07,829
tearing your guts out and that's why you
pretend to be so foul-mouthed and cool.

573
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:12,917
Exactly twice a year on each of your
parents' birthdays, Doreen and Frank,

574
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,712
On their birthdays,
11/16 and 10/23,

575
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,714
you call them in Cincinnati

576
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:22,260
and tell them you love them,
they reply "We love you too, honey bunny."

577
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:26,973
And then you will cry your heart
out on that red goose down pillow.

578
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,017
And you'll hate my guts
for telling you all this.

579
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:33,896
But you know what, Agent Cowles?
Nobody gives a shit.

580
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,155
You want me to go on?

581
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,449
KATHERINE: Go ahead.

582
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,368
What else do you see for me?

583
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,331
- (gunshot)
- Just go home, Kathy.

584
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,419
Just go home.

585
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,474
(siren wailing)

586
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,169
(sirens wail)

587
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,385
COP 1: I've gotta search.

588
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:50,056
(indistinct police patch over radio)

589
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,576
Holy Mother of God.

590
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:24,590
Unsub is male, between
the ages of 18 and 35.

591
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,425
Mental illness likely.

592
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,763
Look for a man with
little personal hygiene,

593
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:35,184
someone conspicuously short
on social skills. A...

594
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:40,189
...mercurial or
an artistic temperament.

595
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:45,987
And for Christ's sakes find
the bottom half of that dress.

596
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:52,577
Sexually motivated,
excessively violent.

597
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,122
This isn't even close
to our guy.

598
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,298
(distorted screaming)

599
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,134
- (distorted singing)
- (birds chirping)

600
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,642
(subway train speeding)

601
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,186
MAN: Hey, cop!

602
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:04,690
- JOHN'S VOICE: Joe.
- KATHERINE'S VOICE: John.

603
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,192
(gunshot)

604
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,695
JOE: John!

605
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,450
Maybe you're right, John.

606
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,663
Maybe we can't catch this guy.
Maybe...

607
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:22,500
Maybe that's exactly what he wants.
We found a clue, John.

608
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:26,212
And I think it's a good one.
I want you to see it.

609
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:30,049
Call it a personal favor.

610
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,972
You know, something really bad
is going to happen.

611
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:42,687
JOE: Your mystery fax was sent over
the Internet by high anonymity proxy.

612
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,522
We had trouble tracking it.

613
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:48,776
We also did a chemical analysis
of Victoria Raymond's bathwater.

614
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:52,697
HIV positive which we knew
from the autopsy and from you.

615
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:56,659
But we found trace elements
of an anti-invertebrate toxin.

616
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,703
Snail poison. On the flowers.

617
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,958
John, I gotta ask.
Do you just know this weird crap

618
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,794
or are you seeing into
my brain right now?

619
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,090
- JOE: We're here.
- (sirens wailing)

620
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:14,176
JOE: This is where
the flowers came from.

621
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,722
Hey.

622
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,476
I owe you an apology.
I'll explain later.

623
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,730
- You okay?
- JOE: John.

624
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,148
Yeah.

625
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,525
JOHN: Yeah.

626
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,236
Wow.

627
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:37,992
We shouldn't be doing this.

628
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,119
Over here!

629
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,789
JOE: Too late now.

630
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:56,093
They look clipped.
Not torn off.

631
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,472
SLOMAN: I'll call forensics.

632
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,348
- John?
- Uh-huh?

633
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,517
- You up for this?
- Yeah, sure.

634
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:19,658
(high-pitched tone)
(distortion)

635
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,474
It's over there.

636
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,605
KATHERINE:
The bottom half of the dress.

637
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,023
Shit!

638
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,193
Get Otis in from the 14th now!

639
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,195
I'm on it.

640
00:51:57,572 --> 00:52:02,076
We found the top half of
the dress pasted to a wall in a tenement.

641
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:07,414
At least half the victim's blood supply.
I was sure it wasn't our guy.

642
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,625
Still doesn't feel right.

643
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,963
- Otis is here.
- And Otis is who?

644
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,049
JOE: Besides you,

645
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,426
he's the best there is.

646
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,806
Otis! Come on, boy. Let's go.

647
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,853
- Where's the item?
- JOE: Right here.

648
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,064
(sniffing)
(barking)

649
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,733
WRANGLER: Let's go, boy.
Find it.

650
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,902
Let's go! Move it up!
Let's go!

651
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:42,324
KATHERINE: I want a 3-block perimeter.
We're on our way to Riverside.

652
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,369
- How far do we follow him?
- As far as he goes.

653
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:49,290
JOHN: I don't trust it.
Either this is useless or...

654
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:52,668
he's leading us somewhere,
maybe into a trap.

655
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:56,005
- John, should I not follow the lead?
- No.

656
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,175
We have to follow him.
Christ, no! It's weird.

657
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,305
WRANGLER: Let's go!

658
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:07,892
Possible subject location.
Give me all units, now!

659
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:12,313
- You wearing a vest?
- Of course. We all are, John.

660
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,398
SLOMAN: Let's go! Move it up!

661
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:22,656
JOE: 2 men on each exit, 6 going in.
Sawyer runs the perimeter.

662
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,241
Let's go.

663
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,203
JOE: Go!

664
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:32,833
AGENT 1: Stairway up.

665
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,837
AGENT 1: Landing. Clear.

666
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,923
Stairway up.

667
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:41,926
Landing. Clear.

668
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:46,639
SLOMAN: Open door!
Closed door left.

669
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:48,724
Hallway.
Closed door right.

670
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,602
(barks)

671
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,520
SLOMAN: Closed door left.

672
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,898
Closed door right.

673
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,441
Closed door right.

674
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,655
FBI! Open up!

675
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,366
Go.

676
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,286
AGENT: FBI! FBI!

677
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,622
Stay to your left!

678
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:16,460
- AGENT 1: Left side clear.
- AGENT 2: Right side clear.

679
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,715
Room clear!

680
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:26,512
- Whoa!
- Do you live here, sir?

681
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,139
- Do you live here?
- This is my studio.

682
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,849
What's your name?

683
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,143
Linus Harp.

684
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:36,480
Do you know
who occupies the opposite studio?

685
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,565
No... No one does.

686
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:41,860
- Turpentine?
- I'm a painter.

687
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:47,700
That's great. Can you
please step outside with us?

688
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,618
Can I lock up first?

689
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,579
No. Your studio is safe.
Step outside.

690
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,207
Frogs.

691
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,584
(chirping)

692
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,226
(gunshot)

693
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,023
(distorted gunfire)

694
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:23,235
- KATHERINE: (distorted) Freeze!
- (gunshots)

695
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:28,657
- Man down!
- SLOMAN: Move! Ambulance!

696
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,205
AGENT: Agent down!

697
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,250
AGENT: Suspect on foot!

698
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,670
He jumped out the window!
I'm coming down!

699
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,339
We gotta get him to county!

700
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,549
- What?
- How's it look?

701
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:49,011
It's not great.
Get an ambulance! Now!

702
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,638
Go with Katherine.

703
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,432
Come on and get him!

704
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:58,479
- KATHERINE: (over radio) Got anything?
- No sign!

705
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:00,606
We got anything? Anything?

706
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,566
(gunshot)

707
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:13,243
(tires screeching)

708
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,378
- What am I looking for?
- No idea!

709
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,254
- SLOMAN: White male...
- Left!

710
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,006
- Left here?
- Left here.

711
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,217
DISPATCHER:
Car heading west...

712
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,387
- In pursuit.
- DISPATCHER: Give us a description.

713
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,514
- Right!
- We will when we can.

714
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,975
(tires screech)

715
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,189
Yellow cab.
He's stolen a yellow cab.

716
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,943
- (tires screeching)
- (horn honking)

717
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,656
I need a number.

718
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:58,080
- Five. M. Four. Three.
- There!

719
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,002
(honking)

720
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,686
MAN: Hey!

721
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,021
WOMAN: Look out!

722
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,110
We're gonna lose him!

723
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,531
MAN: Hey!

724
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:35,075
- Take a left.
- He went straight!

725
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,785
Take a left!

726
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,292
- Okay, stop!
- Sit back!

727
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,169
- Stop the car!
- I got this!

728
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:49,173
Stop the fucking car!
What's the matter with you?

729
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:52,759
- He's gonna get away.
- Just stop the car.

730
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,554
- You want me to let him go?
- Shut up!

731
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,225
Come on! Come on!

732
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,648
Right. Go!

733
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:16,492
(honking)

734
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,843
(screams)

735
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:54,655
- You okay?
- Yeah. Are you?

736
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,657
JOHN: Yeah.
(groans)

737
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,576
Where is he?

738
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,539
KATHERINE: Where is he?

739
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,722
- LINUS: Hey, cop!
- (gunshot)

740
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,597
(gunshots)

741
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,684
(spluttering)
(coughing)

742
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:14,401
- You're not him.
- (spluttering)

743
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,196
(screams)

744
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,000
- You want a moment alone with him?
- Yeah.

745
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:38,175
(monitor beeps steadily in background)

746
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:45,474
(heavy breathing)

747
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,777
- JOE: Did you get the guy?
- No, Katherine did.

748
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,820
Good for her.

749
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:03,158
It wasn't the guy, was it?

750
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,160
JOHN: Nope.

751
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:07,954
So you were right.

752
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,957
He was just leading us
down a path.

753
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,459
Mm-hmm.

754
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:16,254
Handing us that psychopath.

755
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,008
And now...

756
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:24,054
Now he's got another
terminal case to show for it.

757
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,973
Stage four cancer.

758
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,685
You'd picked up on that,
hadn't you?

759
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,728
I figured.

760
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:37,067
I appreciate you
not making me talk about it.

761
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:40,987
I got the diagnosis...

762
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:45,659
...a few months ago.
And...

763
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,870
It's too advanced
to do anything about it.

764
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:51,998
You will...

765
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:56,169
You'll check on Laura
and my little man now and then?

766
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:58,255
JOHN: Yes, of course, I will.

767
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,427
Hell, John!

768
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,722
I'm not ready to die.

769
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,099
I guess, uh...

770
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:15,731
You know, I'd been planning on it.
I've been expecting it for a little bit.

771
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:19,568
But not for a few more months.
You know, I...

772
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,820
I have so much stuff to do.

773
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:26,491
I want to move Laura
to the country.

774
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,953
I want to teach my little boy
to drive.

775
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:33,457
You were always
a lousy driver.

776
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,500
I know.

777
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:39,963
I wanted him to
take after his dad.

778
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,053
(catches breath)
You know, we, uh...

779
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:51,099
We want for so much in life,
you know?

780
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,770
And then we get it.

781
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:58,023
I have it.

782
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,526
But I've run out of time.
There's just no time left.

783
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:06,490
Well, you did a hell of a lot
with your life and time.

784
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,617
My friend.

785
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,661
- Not enough, John.
- JOHN: You did.

786
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:13,955
No.

787
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:20,921
It's good having you back,
you know?

788
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:23,799
Hey.

789
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:26,384
Tell me one of your
crappy jokes.

790
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:32,641
Crappy joke? How about I disconnect you?
Would that make you laugh?

791
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:36,102
It's true.
You really fucking can't.

792
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:44,069
That smile right there.

793
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:48,198
You do me a favor. You take that
to Elizabeth. Okay?

794
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,450
You make it up with her.

795
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,166
(sniffles)

796
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,836
(sobs)

797
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:13,431
I'm sorry I said to you
what I said last night.

798
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:20,105
You wanted to tell me
something at the park.

799
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,815
What was that?

800
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,693
Oh, yeah, I remember.

801
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,238
Yes, it was a...

802
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:33,869
...beautiful Sunday afternoon.
June 24th 1990.

803
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:37,664
I watched my daughter
playing in the garden.

804
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:40,125
Everyone singing
"Happy Birthday."

805
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,043
It was her sixth birthday.

806
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:44,963
All the other kids had a great time.

807
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:47,424
Suddenly, there it was.
I saw it...

808
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,927
Standing just behind her,
behind Emma.

809
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:54,264
It was a shadow.

810
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:56,683
It was moving like a curtain.

811
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,519
Moving in the breeze.

812
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:05,150
I knew it was no trick of the light.
I could feel it all around me.

813
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:07,861
Inside me.
(shudders) Oh, God.

814
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:11,364
It was weird.

815
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:15,493
And then it just sort of faded away.
And, uh...

816
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:20,832
I didn't tell anyone,
not even my wife Elizabeth, no one.

817
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:23,501
But I had no doubt,
no doubt at all.

818
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:29,716
And 20 years later,
to the exact day, she called us.

819
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,844
Thursday morning, 9:23.

820
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:36,556
I thought, "Okay,
This is it. Here we go."

821
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,391
Then came the diagnosis,

822
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,477
Leukemia,

823
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:45,148
followed by two years of
agonizing treatment.

824
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:48,568
Then came the worst day
of my life when she...

825
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:50,987
...died.

826
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:53,365
And she was gone.

827
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,284
Emma.

828
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:10,131
PRIEST: And on the third day,
He arose from the dead,

829
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,842
In accordance
with the scriptures.

830
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:15,136
He ascended into heaven

831
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,264
and sits at the right hand
of the Father.

832
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,518
He will come again in glory,

833
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:24,312
to judge the living and
the dead.

834
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:28,525
And his kingdom
will have no end.

835
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:31,403
Amen.

836
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:56,011
Kevin, come here.

837
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,056
I know, okay.

838
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:10,525
(inaudible)

839
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:16,489
(singing)

840
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,145
(gasping) (train whirring)
(gunshot)

841
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:57,155
- Hey.
- (laughter)

842
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:05,163
(music plays in bar)
♪ Your time is near

843
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:10,085
WAITRESS: Anything else?
- I'll have the same again.

844
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,844
STRANGER:
I wanted to meet you for so long.

845
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:22,055
We're finally face-to-face.

846
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,850
Here you go.

847
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:28,812
- Could I have another one of these?
- Sure.

848
01:08:32,817 --> 01:08:34,651
John, each life I take,

849
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:38,071
it's a life that's saved
from enormous pain.

850
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:42,742
I see what lies ahead for them.
The suffering and the sickness.

851
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,744
I see them writhing in agony.

852
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,747
I hear them screaming,
begging for release.

853
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:50,625
They beg for it, John.

854
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,170
And I grant them their wish.

855
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,172
Only better.

856
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:59,384
I get there before
the wish is even made.

857
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:02,345
I get there before
the pain even starts.

858
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:06,224
As for their loved ones,
there's always an autopsy

859
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:08,810
when the existing
condition is found.

860
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:12,730
That's when I see them
go from shock to relief.

861
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,859
STRANGER:
I hear them say things like,

862
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:18,027
"Thank God it was so sudden."

863
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:20,029
"At least she felt no pain."

864
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:24,033
In the end, they're grateful
for what I've done.

865
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:31,708
That's why I helped
your friend Joe.

866
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:37,797
He had 73 days
of horrific pain ahead.

867
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:42,343
Do you know what benefits
his family would've gotten?

868
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:47,056
Dying of natural causes,
14 years into his career? None.

869
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:51,519
Now his wife gets a pension,
putting their son through college.

870
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,897
Stanford, actually.

871
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:57,025
You think Joe wouldn't have
taken that deal?

872
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:02,322
Please don't call to them.

873
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:04,699
Come on.
You know I have a gun on me.

874
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:11,581
- He's got a gun!
- PEOPLE (screaming): Gun! Get down!

875
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,585
(gunshots)

876
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:17,629
MAN: Drop the gun!

877
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:20,089
(gunshots)

878
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:25,053
I've seen all possible
outcomes of this meeting.

879
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,889
I walk away healthy
from each one.

880
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:31,226
One version's gruesome for our waitress

881
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:35,355
who'd be unlucky as her shift ends
in a couple of minutes.

882
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:39,609
I don't enjoy the work I do.
John, it's not a fetish.

883
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:44,113
It's about allowing those who are
already dying

884
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:46,199
...to die with some dignity.

885
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:57,126
Sometimes the greatest acts of love
are the hardest acts to commit.

886
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:09,305
Why are you giving me
the silent treatment?

887
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:14,811
I got it.
It's a lot to process.

888
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:25,321
That wasn't supposed to happen.

889
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,784
To be continued.
(shouts) He's got a gun!

890
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,619
He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!

891
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:36,082
It's him for Christ's sake!
Leave me alone! Get him!

892
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:42,839
WAITRESS: Oh, he was drinking beer.
But it was non-alcoholic.

893
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:45,383
He had a scar on his forehead.

894
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:48,428
It was kind of jagged, like, scar.

895
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:53,933
Here are all unsolved
murders over the last 10 years

896
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:55,893
with terminally ill victims.

897
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:58,938
- How many?
- 7. No punctures to the medulla,

898
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:00,690
but all painless.

899
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:03,318
- Poisons, gas.
- These are all local?

900
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:05,611
You want the national data, too?

901
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:16,914
CHARLES: Is this how you saw it?
What's Atticus?

902
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:20,293
- KATHERINE: John?
- CHARLES: We're connected.

903
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:23,463
We're the same animal.
Does this look familiar?

904
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,381
EMMA: I'm scared.

905
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:27,383
DAVID: Did she leave a note?

906
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:37,518
CHARLES: Concentrate, John.

907
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,729
Focus, John.

908
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,608
KATHERINE: John!

909
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:53,159
- LINUS: Hey, cop!
- EMMA: I'm scared.

910
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:02,168
CHARLES: Just... focus.

911
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,715
Concentrate, John.

912
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:13,137
Focus.

913
01:13:21,688 --> 01:13:26,359
62 in the last 10 years,
ranging from Juneau to Miami Beach.

914
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,069
Shit!

915
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:33,574
Do one more search.
Remove the terminal constraint.

916
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:36,911
Look for other unsolveds
in the same time period.

917
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:41,374
The killer may have known
they were sick when no one else did.

918
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:45,002
Run everything
against this description:

919
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:49,924
Male, 30s, front-left cranial scar,
almost certainly post-surgical.

920
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,843
Bring me everything...

921
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:54,720
anything you come across. Okay?

922
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,515
(romantic music plays)

923
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:06,107
Hmm.

924
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:24,250
OLDFIELD: That's what it means,
"Congratulations, partner."

925
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:25,960
I'm getting upped!

926
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:31,048
That's what 20 minutes
with a rich geriatric will get you.

927
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:38,598
Well, I'm the youngest partner
in the firm's history.

928
01:14:38,765 --> 01:14:40,850
You can tell your friends that.

929
01:14:45,772 --> 01:14:49,734
I don't know, I mean...
Bring me them on Monday?

930
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,487
OLDFIELD: Whatever they think is right.

931
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:55,114
CHARLES: How to keep. Is there any,

932
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:56,824
is there none such

933
01:14:56,992 --> 01:15:00,995
bow or brooch or braid or brace,
latch or catch or key to keep,

934
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:04,707
keep it, beauty, beauty,
beauty from vanishing away.

935
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:09,670
"O is there no frowning
of these ranked wrinkles deep down?

936
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:12,423
No waving off of these messengers...

937
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:15,801
Still messengers sad and
stealing messengers of grey.

938
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:17,553
BOTH: No, there's none.

939
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:20,515
Nor can you long be what
you now are, called fair.

940
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:23,100
Do what you may do,
do what you may.

941
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:25,853
BOTH:
Wisdom is early to despair.

942
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:29,273
So, be beginning..."

943
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:32,026
- Hello, John.
- Hello, Charles.

944
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:36,864
"Nothing can be done to keep at bay
age and age's evils, hoar hair,

945
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:39,867
ruck and wrinkle,
death's winding sheets,

946
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:43,621
tombs and worms
and tumbling to decay."

947
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:46,207
(chuckles)

948
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:50,044
Anyway, you were right about me.

949
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:53,005
- I was... What's the word?
- Conflicted.

950
01:15:53,173 --> 01:15:58,052
JOHN: I was conflicted about you.
Yeah. But not anymore. Oh, no.

951
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:01,430
You had no right to take
one hour, one minute,

952
01:16:01,598 --> 01:16:07,103
not even one second of time
away from my friend, Joe Merriweather.

953
01:16:08,313 --> 01:16:12,692
I don't know if you've ever really known
anyone who was dying, Charles.

954
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:16,988
Watched them struggling
on the edge of terror and horror

955
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:20,157
as they try to hold on to life.
I don't know,

956
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:25,705
but if you had, perhaps you would
have appreciated how time at the end is...

957
01:16:25,872 --> 01:16:27,873
...kind of precious, I guess.

958
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:32,837
At that point,
even the pain of life itself

959
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:37,174
may be quite beautiful.
You know what I mean?

960
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,469
Is that how
your daughter felt?

961
01:16:41,221 --> 01:16:42,763
CHARLES: That her...

962
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:48,144
- ...her pain was "beautiful?"
- Well, my friend,

963
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:50,563
I'm afraid you won't find out.

964
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:59,155
- Who the fuck are you guys?
- Sit down and shut up.

965
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:08,623
I don't see you pulling
that trigger.

966
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,333
Ditto.

967
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,336
- This is not your style. It's not mercy.
- No?

968
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:18,132
A bullet to the head is better
than what he's got coming.

969
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:21,177
You see, Jeffrey here...

970
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:25,473
has a fight ahead of him
with neurofibromatosis.

971
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:30,645
And that's gonna turn him into
a writhing, crooked beast.

972
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:36,776
Tomorrow night, after some cocktails,
Jeffrey gets his girlfriend pregnant.

973
01:17:36,943 --> 01:17:40,237
And the real charm about NFB
is that it's hereditary.

974
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:44,700
There's a 50 percent chance
the kid gets it, but I can tell you now:

975
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:48,204
the kid... gets it.

976
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:53,876
- What's NFB?
- And you want to gift him that suffering?

977
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,170
Destroy three lives in one,

978
01:17:56,838 --> 01:18:00,299
all because of
some moral judgment?

979
01:18:01,259 --> 01:18:03,386
We can't play God.

980
01:18:03,553 --> 01:18:06,263
No. I have no interest
in playing God.

981
01:18:06,723 --> 01:18:11,143
As far as His work is concerned,
I'm not impressed.

982
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:19,902
- (sobbing)
- (shushing)

983
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:22,571
It's okay.

984
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:26,283
Look at you.
You're so confused.

985
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:30,121
You don't even know
which one of us to shoot.

986
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,582
You'll figure it out
soon enough.

987
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:37,795
Call an ambulance.
You've been poisoned.

988
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:42,425
You need to get to hospital.
Throw up, vomit, whatever. Drink milk.

989
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:44,135
Good luck.

990
01:18:46,638 --> 01:18:49,181
I think we got him.
Your search came back.

991
01:18:49,349 --> 01:18:53,769
I crossed him with the gun records.
Gun was bought by a Charles Ambrose.

992
01:18:53,937 --> 01:18:56,897
Oh, man.
Let's go.

993
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,116
(elevator bell dings)

994
01:19:18,962 --> 01:19:20,504
(elevator bell dings)

995
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:39,523
CHARLES: Concentrate, John.

996
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,736
Someone dies tonight.

997
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,324
Don't lose me now.

998
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,923
SLOMAN: FBI! Open door right!
Open door left!

999
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:08,010
Move in!
Room, clear!

1000
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:23,234
SLOMAN: What is this place?
No furniture? Nothing?

1001
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:25,444
SAWYER: Not a bad view.

1002
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:29,073
CHARLES: Listen!

1003
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:31,575
Katherine!

1004
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:36,831
Who is Charles Ambrose?

1005
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:39,959
Who is he, really?

1006
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:44,255
SLOMAN: How the fuck's he doing this?
CHARLES: I know what they'll look for.

1007
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:48,425
Dysfunctional childhood
that involved abuse and neglect.

1008
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:50,970
CHARLES: Later on...

1009
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:55,307
couldn't hold a job,
couldn't keep a relationship.

1010
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:58,602
- Wrong on all counts.
- What the...

1011
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:09,572
CHARLES: Concentrate.

1012
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:17,246
Mom never left me.
Dad never beat me.

1013
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:21,959
You won't find any trace of violence
or antisocial behavior in my past.

1014
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,336
I'm not a radical.

1015
01:21:24,504 --> 01:21:27,423
I have no interest
in fame or power.

1016
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:33,387
I'm simply a man
who could no longer look away.

1017
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:37,725
Don't stop.

1018
01:21:45,275 --> 01:21:49,403
God knows I would prefer
to live the quiet life...

1019
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:54,116
...away from all that
I have become.

1020
01:21:56,202 --> 01:21:59,038
But we don't always get
to choose what we are.

1021
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:03,584
There you go.

1022
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:18,057
(distortion)

1023
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:24,396
(monitor beeping steadily)

1024
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:27,566
It hurts so bad.
(sobs)

1025
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,069
I'm so scared.

1026
01:22:31,154 --> 01:22:32,905
(Emma continues to sob)

1027
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:48,045
Officer Pearce.
My name is Charles Ambrose.

1028
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:53,634
Tell your supervisor you just met me.
It will do wonders for your career.

1029
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:56,762
Officer Pearce here.

1030
01:22:57,389 --> 01:23:01,392
And now the savior...
needs to be saved.

1031
01:23:01,559 --> 01:23:04,144
(phone rings)

1032
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:08,941
(ringing continues)

1033
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:12,653
Clancy doesn't want you
to respond, Agent Cowles.

1034
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,947
- (ringing continues)
- Sloman.

1035
01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:19,660
CHARLES: He doesn't want you
there when it happens. But you will.

1036
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,037
You'll respond.
You'll be there.

1037
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:24,832
You can't help yourself.

1038
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:27,584
Hey.

1039
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:29,503
Hey, a beat cop

1040
01:23:30,296 --> 01:23:33,549
just reported a Charles Ambrose
at Ashland Station.

1041
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:38,429
Where are you going?
Hey! Get back here.

1042
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:40,681
See you soon.

1043
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:50,065
(train approaching)

1044
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:56,613
(train whirring)

1045
01:23:56,781 --> 01:23:58,657
(distortion)

1046
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:47,414
(distortion)

1047
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:58,008
(intercom chimes)

1048
01:25:01,387 --> 01:25:03,097
And here you are.

1049
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:07,976
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

1050
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,231
Just as I've seen it all those years.
You, me, this train.

1051
01:25:12,398 --> 01:25:16,193
You've seen it, too, right?
You've heard it? Day after day?

1052
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:18,445
(imitates train)

1053
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:24,618
Except something's not right.

1054
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,955
(gunshot)
(passengers scream)

1055
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:37,506
(sirens wailing)

1056
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:44,596
This is Agent Cowles. Our suspect
is headed into Ashland Station.

1057
01:25:44,764 --> 01:25:50,519
We'll have the engineer stop the train
in a station up ahead where we'll set up.

1058
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:52,855
- Then what?
- We take him out.

1059
01:25:53,022 --> 01:25:56,275
- I advise you to stay clear.
- I'm not staying clear.

1060
01:25:56,442 --> 01:25:59,319
We have control. Stay clear.

1061
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:02,614
Shit!

1062
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:05,492
(tires screeching)

1063
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:08,287
We're connected.

1064
01:26:09,205 --> 01:26:13,208
- The same animal.
- No, no. I'm not a killer.

1065
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:17,337
- We can talk about that in seven minutes.
- Seven minutes?

1066
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:20,883
That's when you kill someone.

1067
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:23,844
- Who might that be?
- Me.

1068
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:26,680
Move, Move!
Move in!

1069
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:29,057
- Let's go!
- Move!

1070
01:26:29,225 --> 01:26:30,726
Go!
Move!

1071
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:35,022
Go!
Move! Move! Move!

1072
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:39,067
Train is five minutes out!

1073
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:42,112
Let's go! Move!

1074
01:26:43,114 --> 01:26:44,698
I'm dying, John.

1075
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:47,284
I can't continue this work anymore.

1076
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:50,329
That's why I need someone
to carry on for me.

1077
01:26:50,788 --> 01:26:53,540
Someone who can see the pain.

1078
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:56,335
The suffering. Sickness.

1079
01:26:56,836 --> 01:27:00,839
There's another reason you have
to shoot me that you don't see.

1080
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:02,633
Concentrate!

1081
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:06,470
(distortion)

1082
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,096
- John.
- (gunshot)

1083
01:27:08,264 --> 01:27:09,264
John.

1084
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,767
There it is. Thank you.

1085
01:27:12,435 --> 01:27:14,019
CHARLES: Agent Cowles.

1086
01:27:14,687 --> 01:27:16,521
You've grown so fond of her.

1087
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,691
It's like having
your daughter back.

1088
01:27:19,859 --> 01:27:22,194
I'm sorry.
You've lost me, Charles.

1089
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:26,156
She doesn't fit your profile.
Why would you kill her?

1090
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:30,661
(chuckles) You're right.
I won't kill her. She's perfectly healthy.

1091
01:27:30,828 --> 01:27:34,373
That's the beauty of it.
You're going to stop me first.

1092
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:37,501
Yes.
With one bullet, right here.

1093
01:27:39,003 --> 01:27:42,965
- And after that, there's no turning back.
- Sorry, my friend.

1094
01:27:43,132 --> 01:27:45,342
The game stops here and now.

1095
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:49,972
I want 4 shooters, 3 low, 1 high!
Train is 60 seconds out.

1096
01:27:50,139 --> 01:27:51,974
Let's go. Move!

1097
01:27:54,769 --> 01:27:55,811
KATHERINE: FBI!

1098
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:59,022
- OFFICER: Ma'am...
- FBI! Let me through!

1099
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:01,066
- (distortion)
- (honking)

1100
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:03,068
Look at me, John.

1101
01:28:04,028 --> 01:28:05,696
Does this look familiar?

1102
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,545
See now?

1103
01:28:24,424 --> 01:28:26,466
All your visions
become real.

1104
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:34,182
CAPTAIN:
50 seconds to target.

1105
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:37,185
- Do you have a visual?
- Captain.

1106
01:28:37,353 --> 01:28:39,146
- Do you have a shot?
- OFFICER: Affirmative.

1107
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:42,441
She's going to make it
just in time.

1108
01:28:45,361 --> 01:28:48,447
- Take the shot!
- (OVER RADIO) Take the shot!

1109
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:50,741
Fuck! I lost him!

1110
01:28:52,535 --> 01:28:54,661
- Take the shot!
- (screaming)

1111
01:28:55,538 --> 01:28:59,583
- OFFICER: Target is locked.
- (distorted radio) (screaming)

1112
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:01,335
SWAT CAPTAIN: Let's go!

1113
01:29:04,213 --> 01:29:06,340
Say hello to your destiny,
John.

1114
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,051
(shouting)

1115
01:29:15,558 --> 01:29:16,933
- (gunshot)
- Fire!

1116
01:29:17,101 --> 01:29:19,311
(gunfire)

1117
01:29:19,645 --> 01:29:21,480
SWAT CAPTAIN: Hold! Hold!

1118
01:29:31,407 --> 01:29:33,408
(shell-shock distortion)

1119
01:29:34,952 --> 01:29:36,703
I told you you'd kill me.

1120
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:39,289
- Clear to fire!
- (gunshot)

1121
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:41,541
(gunshot)

1122
01:30:03,147 --> 01:30:06,358
(gasping)

1123
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:09,528
- John.
- You're okay.

1124
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:13,323
JOHN: You're okay.

1125
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:30,882
(monitor beeping steadily)

1126
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,102
- Oh, hi.
- (chuckles)

1127
01:30:42,728 --> 01:30:43,770
Hey.

1128
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:48,358
- How are you doing?
- I spoke to the chief surgeon.

1129
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:50,861
He said the surgery was a success.

1130
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:55,073
- Good.
- He said the bullet went clean through.

1131
01:30:55,241 --> 01:30:56,783
(exhales)

1132
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:01,079
I was hoping you would
consider a reinstatement.

1133
01:31:01,247 --> 01:31:04,040
As Joe said,
we'd make a hell of a team.

1134
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:05,876
Oh no, I want a quiet life.

1135
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:07,836
Yeah.
(voice breaks)

1136
01:31:11,048 --> 01:31:13,133
JOHN: Joe would be proud of you.

1137
01:31:20,224 --> 01:31:23,059
(sniffs)
(sobs)

1138
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:28,482
JOHN: Don't cry.
You're a good kid.

1139
01:31:32,778 --> 01:31:35,363
It was good
working with you, John.

1140
01:31:37,074 --> 01:31:39,701
- I'll see you around.
- See you around.

1141
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:43,038
- Take care of yourself.
- I will.

1142
01:31:46,459 --> 01:31:48,001
Oh, yeah, um...

1143
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:52,547
Nearly forgot. Could you
help me with this?

1144
01:31:52,715 --> 01:31:54,382
See it gets to delivered.

1145
01:31:59,722 --> 01:32:01,264
I got it.

1146
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:07,145
Joe.

1147
01:32:30,169 --> 01:32:31,795
Hello, Elizabeth.

1148
01:32:32,463 --> 01:32:34,047
Hello, John.

1149
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,383
You look so beautiful.

1150
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:42,639
I read your letter.
Several times.

1151
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:45,809
It's different
than the others.

1152
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:47,519
Which way?

1153
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:50,939
It's all about the past.

1154
01:32:51,857 --> 01:32:53,400
Oh, yeah?

1155
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:58,154
Yeah, I think of Emma.
Every single day.

1156
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,829
Come here.

1157
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:10,750
- JOHN: It's okay.
- (she sobs)

1158
01:33:23,222 --> 01:33:26,182
- (monitor beeping steadily)
- (sobbing)

1159
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:29,144
EMMA: It hurts.

1160
01:33:31,647 --> 01:33:33,440
I'm scared.

1161
01:33:36,402 --> 01:33:38,612
I'm so scared.

1162
01:33:45,828 --> 01:33:48,371
Oh, my...
It hurts.

1163
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:06,264
(monitor beeps rapidly)

1164
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:11,019
(monitor flat-lines)

1165
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:35,960
CHARLES: Sometimes
the greatest acts of love...

1166
01:34:36,128 --> 01:34:38,421
...are the hardest acts
to commit.

1167
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:48,390
JOHN: Let's walk, shall we?

1168
01:34:49,892 --> 01:34:51,810
CHARLES: See you soon, John.
