1
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,631
Nice car.

2
00:03:19,177 --> 00:03:21,008
Sweet!

3
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:31,585
Nice.

4
00:03:34,993 --> 00:03:36,893
You little maggot!

5
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:40,728
-You get back here!
-What are you doing?

6
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,823
This your kid?

7
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,267
Take a look at his hand.
You'll find the valve caps to my '59 Caddy.

8
00:03:45,337 --> 00:03:46,929
Is that true, Jesse?

9
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:53,041
How many times have I told you
to stop stealing parts off people's cars!

10
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:55,813
Go on inside. Go!

11
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:03,417
I'm really sorry about this.

12
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:05,880
You know how kids can be.

13
00:04:06,057 --> 00:04:07,752
That's all right. No harm done.

14
00:04:08,827 --> 00:04:11,193
Where are you from?
I've never seen you before.

15
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:13,094
Just sort of passing through.

16
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:17,328
I remember saying that very same thing.
That was about four years ago.

17
00:04:17,402 --> 00:04:18,460
You from L.A.?

18
00:04:18,537 --> 00:04:20,562
No, ma'am. Jersey City, mostly.

19
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,307
What's with this "ma'am" stuff?

20
00:04:24,075 --> 00:04:25,906
Am I looking that old already?

21
00:04:25,977 --> 00:04:27,410
No, ma'am.

22
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:30,640
-There you go again.
-I'm just playing around.

23
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,408
I'm Cybil Waingrow.

24
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:35,950
Very nice name.

25
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:40,157
That's Cybil with a "C,"
not Sybil with an "S."

26
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:41,351
Really?

27
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,593
It's a pleasure to meet you, Cybil,
with or without a "C."

28
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,557
It's nice to meet you. You drink coffee?

29
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:48,923
That's a start.

30
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:50,393
You got any money?

31
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,298
Wow! Jersey's, like,
3,000 miles from here.

32
00:04:58,577 --> 00:05:00,772
Mom, can I have a Coke or something?

33
00:05:01,146 --> 00:05:02,738
Can't you see I'm talking?

34
00:05:02,814 --> 00:05:04,008
Mom, why can't....

35
00:05:04,082 --> 00:05:06,312
Sweetie, I didn't bring my purse with me.

36
00:05:08,787 --> 00:05:10,880
Hey, hang on a second.

37
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,179
Here.

38
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,355
Go get yourself whatever you want.

39
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:19,027
Wow, $5. Thanks, mister.

40
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,097
-Hey, Dorth.
-Yeah, Jesse?

41
00:05:24,936 --> 00:05:25,925
You like kids?

42
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:29,364
I'm not much the fathering type,
to tell you the truth.

43
00:05:30,108 --> 00:05:34,135
Austin, my ex, named him after
Jesse James, the bank robber.

44
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:36,544
-Hell of a role model.
-That's what I said.

45
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:38,014
I have $5.

46
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,308
Where is Daddy now?

47
00:05:40,452 --> 00:05:41,919
I don't know.

48
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:45,548
It's hard to keep track when you
write them and they don't write you back.

49
00:05:48,126 --> 00:05:49,616
Who cares, anyhow?

50
00:05:50,128 --> 00:05:51,356
Not me.

51
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,689
Wow! You must think
I'm some cheap date.

52
00:05:54,332 --> 00:05:57,927
No, sir. I don't know how
you city folks work.

53
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:02,839
But here, it takes a lot more than
a cup of coffee and a plate of chow...

54
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,703
...to get a sophisticated woman like me
into the sack.

55
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:09,241
That's for damn sure.

56
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,818
You do make that cigarette look good.

57
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:16,319
-You make that dress look good.
-You're so sweet.

58
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:20,277
Do I owe you anything? You know, like....

59
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,918
I didn't mean to offend, I just....

60
00:07:26,124 --> 00:07:28,922
I haven't been with a woman
in a really long time, okay?

61
00:07:29,694 --> 00:07:31,218
-Right.
-I'm serious.

62
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:34,461
Like five-and-a-half-year serious,
you know what I mean?

63
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:36,189
Oh, my God!

64
00:07:37,068 --> 00:07:39,229
You just got out!

65
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,529
I'm sorry.

66
00:07:42,907 --> 00:07:45,341
Well, I guess we're even.

67
00:07:47,946 --> 00:07:49,004
Wait a minute.

68
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,277
Michael, you don't offer a woman money
if it's been nice.

69
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:55,519
You give her flowers or chocolate
or something.

70
00:07:55,987 --> 00:07:57,477
You know what I mean?

71
00:08:14,973 --> 00:08:15,837
Hey, Murph!

72
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,850
This must be our singer.

73
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:30,346
Yeah, because we know you can't sing.

74
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:32,887
Yeah, but I play a mean guitar.

75
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:36,687
Mike.

76
00:08:37,062 --> 00:08:39,462
Hey, man. You're looking....

77
00:08:40,098 --> 00:08:42,089
-Yeah!
-You look good.

78
00:08:42,534 --> 00:08:44,729
-You feel good?
-Yeah.

79
00:08:46,137 --> 00:08:48,537
-Enjoying your freedom?
-Ain't free yet.

80
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:52,041
Come on, it's a whole lot better
than that cage we shared.

81
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,670
Big sky, lots of space.

82
00:08:54,846 --> 00:08:56,370
Not enough water.

83
00:08:58,283 --> 00:09:01,582
"Not enough water."
It'll always be something with you, Mike.

84
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:03,484
Well, you know me.

85
00:09:06,424 --> 00:09:07,755
Who's the kid?

86
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:10,422
I don't know.

87
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,825
Looks like he knows you.

88
00:09:15,934 --> 00:09:19,165
Just because that kid is packing heat,
doesn't make him my partner.

89
00:09:19,571 --> 00:09:21,095
That's right.

90
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:24,700
I'm your partner.

91
00:09:27,712 --> 00:09:28,701
Ready to play?

92
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,839
Always ready to play, Murph.

93
00:09:37,622 --> 00:09:39,351
What's up, Michael?

94
00:09:39,424 --> 00:09:41,051
These your new girlfriends?

95
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:42,855
What's happening, man?

96
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:47,487
Franklin.

97
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,965
Get in the back.

98
00:09:54,706 --> 00:09:57,038
-Move over, Gus.
-I got window.

99
00:09:57,108 --> 00:10:00,043
Great, so I get bitch. That's nice.

100
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:07,581
What's up?

101
00:10:09,387 --> 00:10:11,378
-Hey, kid.
-Yeah.

102
00:10:12,357 --> 00:10:14,416
You ever shoot anybody with them things?

103
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:19,454
Didn't think so.

104
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:28,565
Hey, Murphy.

105
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:32,005
What's the smartest thing
ever come out of a bitch's mouth?

106
00:10:33,311 --> 00:10:35,506
-What?
-Einstein's cock!

107
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,448
That's a good one.

108
00:10:47,926 --> 00:10:49,416
What are you so quiet about?

109
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:52,189
I told you, I hate the desert.

110
00:10:52,797 --> 00:10:54,788
Yeah, I know, for the second time now.

111
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:56,094
Check it out!

112
00:10:56,334 --> 00:10:57,961
Deathmatch 3000.

113
00:10:58,036 --> 00:11:00,630
In the red corner, Frank Sinatra.

114
00:11:00,805 --> 00:11:03,865
And in the blue corner, Elvis Presley.

115
00:11:04,008 --> 00:11:06,977
I'm not talking about no cartoon shit.
The real deal!

116
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:08,910
Real cats scrapping it out!

117
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:10,275
Who's going down?

118
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:15,012
The Chairman of the Board and
the King are looking mighty mean tonight.

119
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:18,544
I'll tell you, the King lands one
right in the Chairman's nuts!

120
00:11:18,723 --> 00:11:20,816
-Hot tamale!
-There it is, baby.

121
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,256
But the King slips!

122
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:26,286
He goes down and Ol' Blue Eyes goes in
for the Italian Necktie!

123
00:11:27,532 --> 00:11:29,124
The King is down!

124
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,393
The King is down! No!

125
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:37,367
Fuck, man! Let me know
when you're going to do that.

126
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:39,171
Who said "the King is down"?

127
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:43,604
-Let it go.
-Did I say something to you?

128
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:46,678
Then shut the fuck up.

129
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,087
Who said "the King is down"?

130
00:11:50,154 --> 00:11:52,645
-We were just having a little fun.
-I know.

131
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,417
So, who said it?

132
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:56,084
I said it, Murphy.

133
00:11:57,762 --> 00:11:59,696
Don't say it any fucking more.

134
00:11:59,797 --> 00:12:02,732
-It was just a joke.
-Well, it wasn't fucking funny.

135
00:12:05,136 --> 00:12:06,103
Sinatra.

136
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,539
Fuck Sinatra. Nobody fucks with the King
and nobody ever says he's down.

137
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:14,277
Hey, Murphy, we all love the King.

138
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,311
That's right.
Elvis would beat Sinatra's ass!

139
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:21,683
That's fucking right.

140
00:12:21,753 --> 00:12:24,688
What's the best thing
about dating homeless girls?

141
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:27,287
You can drop them off anywhere.

142
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,204
Let me out!

143
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:49,839
Damn, my ass is all sweaty.

144
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,710
Murph.

145
00:12:54,052 --> 00:12:55,679
Good to see you, Jack.

146
00:12:57,955 --> 00:12:59,582
Really good to see you.

147
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:01,691
-Michael.
-Jack, how are you doing?

148
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,556
How does it feel to be out?

149
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:06,593
-You know how it feels.
-Yes, I do.

150
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:09,789
-You got them?
-Inside.

151
00:13:11,436 --> 00:13:12,801
Hey, Franklin.

152
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:20,144
Stop. You're killing me, man.
You're killing me.

153
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:22,504
Pretty loose group you got there.

154
00:13:26,884 --> 00:13:29,148
-Don't shoot me!
-Dance, motherfucker!

155
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,886
-They dialed in?
-They're good on stage.

156
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:33,920
It's going to be some show!

157
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:39,024
The snakeskin is mine.

158
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:41,990
-I got that one.
-That's mine.

159
00:13:50,775 --> 00:13:51,969
Hey, Michael.

160
00:13:52,677 --> 00:13:54,406
It's good to see you.

161
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:56,606
-You want to come in?
-No, I can't.

162
00:13:57,148 --> 00:13:59,343
Really, I just wanted to ask you....

163
00:14:00,952 --> 00:14:03,182
Well, maybe for a second or two.

164
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,451
You haven't seen my wallet,
by any chance?

165
00:14:08,526 --> 00:14:09,618
Your wallet?

166
00:14:09,694 --> 00:14:12,857
I had it yesterday when I paid the check
at the coffee shop.

167
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,626
I was just backtracking my steps.

168
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,531
Well, I haven't seen it.

169
00:14:18,836 --> 00:14:20,633
Jesse, get back here!

170
00:14:20,972 --> 00:14:22,940
Did you take this man's wallet?

171
00:14:23,007 --> 00:14:24,872
Don't shut that door on me!

172
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:26,304
Don't lock it.

173
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:31,678
He does this all the time. Sorry.

174
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:35,048
Would you hand me that little stepladder
over there, please?

175
00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:38,852
Thank you.

176
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,425
He's like a ferret. Takes anything
he can get his hands on and hides it all...

177
00:14:46,297 --> 00:14:47,730
...up...

178
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:49,090
...here.

179
00:14:55,506 --> 00:14:57,235
Sorry about this.

180
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,209
There was....

181
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:01,275
Money?

182
00:15:01,345 --> 00:15:03,279
$460, yeah.

183
00:15:17,161 --> 00:15:18,560
Is this it?

184
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:21,457
Just about.

185
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:23,056
Sorry for all the trouble.

186
00:15:23,134 --> 00:15:24,897
He really isn't a bad kid.

187
00:15:27,438 --> 00:15:29,269
I'm sure he's an angel.

188
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:35,573
Wait a minute.

189
00:15:36,214 --> 00:15:38,910
-I can get your money back.
-It's okay. It's just...

190
00:15:38,983 --> 00:15:40,314
...$20.

191
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:41,815
How about...

192
00:15:42,487 --> 00:15:45,513
...l'll pay it back to you
with another cup of coffee?

193
00:17:09,674 --> 00:17:11,403
Time to go to work, baby.

194
00:17:13,277 --> 00:17:14,437
Let's do it.

195
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:33,416
Here we are
at the Riviera Hoteland Casino...

196
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:35,550
...andit's lnternational Elvis Week.

197
00:18:58,616 --> 00:19:00,481
I don't know what the big deal is.

198
00:19:00,551 --> 00:19:03,076
That porker has been dead
for 20 years now.

199
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,651
He was a god.

200
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:07,050
And second, he ain't dead.

201
00:19:07,324 --> 00:19:09,554
We've gone from Rat Pack to Fat Pack.

202
00:19:45,362 --> 00:19:46,351
Murphy.

203
00:19:48,032 --> 00:19:49,829
Long time no see.

204
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:50,992
Back off.

205
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:53,196
Watch yourself, son.

206
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,369
That's no way to treat your friends.

207
00:19:58,442 --> 00:20:01,377
I never met you in my life.
Be smart and take a fucking walk.

208
00:20:01,445 --> 00:20:04,141
Hey, man, now come on, don't be cruel.

209
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:44,115
Would you?

210
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:49,718
Thank you.

211
00:21:16,353 --> 00:21:17,980
Honey, doesn't he look marvelous?

212
00:21:20,324 --> 00:21:22,849
We think you look just marvelous!

213
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:25,428
Thank you, ma'am.

214
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:27,157
Thank you very much.

215
00:21:32,136 --> 00:21:33,228
Sorry.

216
00:21:58,429 --> 00:21:59,862
What's the problem?

217
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:02,157
Emergency stop on nine.

218
00:22:05,502 --> 00:22:07,163
Probably some couple screwing again.

219
00:22:10,174 --> 00:22:11,436
Do we have visual?

220
00:22:11,508 --> 00:22:14,477
No. Sir, the camera in car eight is down.

221
00:22:14,545 --> 00:22:18,413
Switch to override. Bring it down for
a security check. Have security waiting.

222
00:22:40,971 --> 00:22:43,337
All right, everybody stay cool.

223
00:22:44,508 --> 00:22:46,499
Back up.

224
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:02,652
White is light, red is dead.

225
00:23:13,203 --> 00:23:16,172
I'm only going to say this once.
Who is listening?

226
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,537
I am.

227
00:23:33,691 --> 00:23:35,215
In the corner, now.

228
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:39,927
Get on your knees, put your heads
on the ground. What's your problem?

229
00:23:39,997 --> 00:23:41,464
What's your problem?

230
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:43,722
He's deaf!

231
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:47,430
Well, you're not.
Put his head on the fucking ground.

232
00:23:52,443 --> 00:23:54,843
$50s and $100s, no cellophane.

233
00:23:58,949 --> 00:24:00,416
Holy shit!

234
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:03,619
Main booth, scramble security.

235
00:24:03,687 --> 00:24:05,382
Call Vegas P.D. We need backup.

236
00:24:06,757 --> 00:24:08,349
-Shut up.
-Shut up!

237
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:10,586
Let's go. Come on, Gus.

238
00:24:12,463 --> 00:24:13,953
Come on, Gus!

239
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:16,630
Let's go, Gus.

240
00:24:18,002 --> 00:24:19,367
That's enough!

241
00:24:21,438 --> 00:24:24,703
They're coming out. Do not engage
on floor, direct them to B-41 .

242
00:24:24,775 --> 00:24:26,402
Intercept there. B-4-1.

243
00:24:34,318 --> 00:24:35,717
They're at Registration.

244
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,456
Vegas P.D. en route.

245
00:24:45,696 --> 00:24:47,163
Right at VIP.

246
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:51,267
Let me know if they follow, Hanson.

247
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:53,870
Station 3, where are you?

248
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:58,701
They're coming.

249
00:25:00,477 --> 00:25:01,808
Nothing'll happen here.

250
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,569
Left at dollar slots.

251
00:25:06,216 --> 00:25:07,740
Relax, Gus.

252
00:25:08,218 --> 00:25:09,310
They're moving us.

253
00:25:10,687 --> 00:25:13,247
Anyone gets between us and Michael,
it's on.

254
00:25:26,737 --> 00:25:27,999
They're in B-41 .

255
00:25:37,714 --> 00:25:39,739
Freeze! Hold it right there.

256
00:25:44,822 --> 00:25:46,653
Everyone we got, now, scramble!

257
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:53,359
Go!

258
00:25:54,765 --> 00:25:56,232
Give me the fucking camera !

259
00:26:45,282 --> 00:26:46,374
Missed me, bitch!

260
00:27:57,387 --> 00:27:58,217
Come on!

261
00:27:58,622 --> 00:28:01,750
Let's go! Franklin, let's go!

262
00:28:20,577 --> 00:28:21,236
Come on!

263
00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:29,051
Knock them down, Michael!

264
00:28:44,501 --> 00:28:45,433
Let's go!

265
00:28:46,837 --> 00:28:48,327
Freeze! Vegas P.D.!

266
00:29:01,752 --> 00:29:02,650
Get the gun!

267
00:29:12,696 --> 00:29:14,527
Take us up, Mike!

268
00:29:16,566 --> 00:29:17,760
Franklin is hit!

269
00:29:20,037 --> 00:29:22,562
Franklin, come on! You'll make it!

270
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:34,049
Fifteen, one to go!

271
00:29:35,185 --> 00:29:36,174
Clear!

272
00:29:42,492 --> 00:29:43,982
Where the hell is he?

273
00:29:45,095 --> 00:29:46,824
Christ, Murph, what's the deal?

274
00:29:47,064 --> 00:29:48,258
Fuck!

275
00:29:48,465 --> 00:29:49,625
He'll be here.

276
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:52,025
"Just slip out the back, Jack

277
00:29:52,469 --> 00:29:54,460
"Make a new plan, Stan

278
00:29:54,638 --> 00:29:56,629
"You don't need to be coy, Roy

279
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,708
"Just listen to me

280
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:03,568
"Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much

281
00:30:04,081 --> 00:30:09,144
"Just drop off the key, Lee
And set yourself free"

282
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:56,764
Helicopter!

283
00:31:05,742 --> 00:31:06,800
Let's go!

284
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:34,598
Ladies and gentlemen,
Elvis has left the building!

285
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:43,373
Hang in there!

286
00:31:43,447 --> 00:31:46,314
-You're going to make it!
-You're going to be okay, Franklin!

287
00:31:52,756 --> 00:31:53,654
I'm dying!

288
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,858
-Put pressure on it!
-I'm dying, man!

289
00:31:58,662 --> 00:31:59,924
I won't make it!

290
00:32:01,198 --> 00:32:02,028
Hang on!

291
00:32:02,566 --> 00:32:04,056
Help me!

292
00:32:26,356 --> 00:32:27,584
Is he gonna make it?

293
00:32:35,765 --> 00:32:36,789
Fuck him.

294
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:52,697
How you doing?

295
00:34:37,253 --> 00:34:39,118
Where is the pisser?

296
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:41,484
-Nice place you got here.
-A real shit hole.

297
00:34:54,404 --> 00:34:55,666
Gus, give me a hand.

298
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:01,206
Oh, yeah.

299
00:35:02,312 --> 00:35:03,609
That's a lot of money.

300
00:35:40,116 --> 00:35:41,879
$3.2 million.

301
00:35:41,951 --> 00:35:44,579
$3.2 million?

302
00:35:45,522 --> 00:35:47,149
That's a beautiful thing.

303
00:35:47,223 --> 00:35:49,088
Less Jack's 10 percent.

304
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,790
Right.

305
00:35:52,996 --> 00:35:53,655
Damn.

306
00:35:54,898 --> 00:35:57,230
That's a lot of money
just to fly a helicopter.

307
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,962
Would you rather we used
a hot air balloon?

308
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,859
No.

309
00:36:01,938 --> 00:36:05,374
Or maybe hang gliders?
Would you rather we used hang gliders?

310
00:36:05,442 --> 00:36:07,433
I don't know what a hang glider is.

311
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:10,707
I doubt you know how to fly
a fucking helicopter, either.

312
00:36:11,014 --> 00:36:14,177
If you ask me, $320,000 is well worth it.

313
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:17,145
Besides, Jack has
taken care of a lot of shit...

314
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,313
...you don't know anything about.

315
00:36:20,356 --> 00:36:21,914
All right. Back to business.

316
00:36:24,461 --> 00:36:26,258
Where is Franklin's pile?

317
00:36:27,797 --> 00:36:29,264
What are you talking about?

318
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:31,790
Franklin. Anybody remember him?

319
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,899
I was there. Franklin is dead.

320
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:38,869
Right. So, where is Franklin's pile?

321
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:43,836
Well, Murph, we don't make him a pile.
We split up four ways.

322
00:36:44,247 --> 00:36:46,647
Wrong. Franklin's pile
does not get split up.

323
00:36:51,221 --> 00:36:52,950
Sure, I'm good with that.

324
00:36:53,356 --> 00:36:56,792
Bullshit!
Who gets the remaining 15 percent, then?

325
00:36:56,893 --> 00:36:59,191
-Let me guess.
-It was my deal, Hanson.

326
00:36:59,863 --> 00:37:03,924
No, I want that 15 percent
split up four ways.

327
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:06,701
-You want?
-Yeah, I want.

328
00:37:08,538 --> 00:37:10,870
Well, I could give a flying fuck
what you want.

329
00:37:11,508 --> 00:37:13,533
A deal is a deal.

330
00:37:13,977 --> 00:37:15,706
Let me put it this way.

331
00:37:16,212 --> 00:37:19,670
That fucking deal died with Franklin.
Now, it's time to make a new deal.

332
00:37:21,918 --> 00:37:24,284
That's a commitment, Hanson.
I'll give you that.

333
00:37:25,221 --> 00:37:28,952
Fuck it. We shot everybody in the casino,
let's start shooting each other.

334
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,890
Come on, you guys, let's just settle down,
all right? We don't need this.

335
00:37:35,632 --> 00:37:38,226
Gus is right. Let's just keep this simple.

336
00:37:38,334 --> 00:37:42,634
I'll take my 15 percent, plus 25 percent
of Franklin's end, and I'll take it now.

337
00:37:42,705 --> 00:37:45,265
-I'm not letting that happen.
-Why the hell not?

338
00:37:45,341 --> 00:37:48,139
Because that would change the plan,
and when plans change...

339
00:37:48,211 --> 00:37:49,610
...things get fucked up!

340
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:53,137
-You'll have to learn to be more flexible.
-The plan stays!

341
00:37:53,817 --> 00:37:55,910
We have an arrangement in Twin Falls...

342
00:37:55,985 --> 00:37:59,352
...where we'll get 70 cents on the dollar.
We'll keep that arrangement.

343
00:37:59,489 --> 00:38:00,683
All of us.

344
00:38:00,757 --> 00:38:04,853
After that, I'm over the border into Canada
and you can all get on Michael's boat...

345
00:38:04,928 --> 00:38:06,122
...for all I care.

346
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:08,994
No. Nobody gets on my boat but me.

347
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:10,559
Right.

348
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:11,725
Whatever.

349
00:38:11,801 --> 00:38:15,134
If anyone goes before then,
there's a chance you'll spend the money.

350
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:17,332
You spend the money, you'll get popped.

351
00:38:17,407 --> 00:38:19,375
And the chances are you'll talk.

352
00:38:19,442 --> 00:38:21,876
Either way, I'm not taking that chance.

353
00:38:22,312 --> 00:38:26,612
Murph, I've been doing this a long time
and I've never dropped dime on anybody.

354
00:38:26,716 --> 00:38:30,379
Want to keep blowing smoke in my face,
or you want me to blow your head off?

355
00:38:37,861 --> 00:38:41,661
You go do whatever it is you got to do
in Twin Falls or wherever.

356
00:38:41,731 --> 00:38:43,198
That's your criminal right.

357
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,124
Me, I'm staying right here.

358
00:38:45,201 --> 00:38:48,295
You both have hot sheets.
Instead of traveling with you...

359
00:38:48,605 --> 00:38:52,006
...l should be putting as much distance
from you as humanly possible.

360
00:38:52,075 --> 00:38:55,010
Traveling with you fucks
is the weakest part of the plan.

361
00:38:55,078 --> 00:38:59,139
But since we don't trust each other,
we'll travel north together as a group.

362
00:38:59,215 --> 00:39:02,707
So, try to think of us as the Osmonds,
only we don't fucking get along.

363
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,884
Gentlemen, as far as I'm concerned,
this job is done.

364
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:12,291
I'm cashing out.
Just give me my fucking money.

365
00:39:13,162 --> 00:39:14,493
Is that an order?

366
00:39:14,697 --> 00:39:17,291
No, come on, that wasn't an order.

367
00:39:17,367 --> 00:39:19,358
I mean, technically it wasn't.

368
00:39:19,435 --> 00:39:22,131
-What about you, Gus?
-What?

369
00:39:22,405 --> 00:39:24,669
You think this is your fucking money?

370
00:39:24,741 --> 00:39:28,507
No, no. This is my money.
That's your money.

371
00:39:29,178 --> 00:39:30,167
Michael.

372
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,078
I just want to get on the move, Murph.

373
00:39:34,317 --> 00:39:37,582
Makes you the only fucking pig
in the room, Hanson.

374
00:39:55,438 --> 00:39:57,133
You make me laugh, you know?

375
00:39:57,206 --> 00:40:00,039
I can't imagine what goes through
that sick mind of yours.

376
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:03,545
Sometimes I actually think you believe
you're the King himself.

377
00:40:03,613 --> 00:40:06,946
What is it with those side burns?
I glued mine on for the job.

378
00:40:07,016 --> 00:40:09,348
For you, it's an actual lifestyle choice.

379
00:40:09,419 --> 00:40:10,909
-Shut up.
-I'm serious!

380
00:40:10,987 --> 00:40:11,976
Shut up.

381
00:40:12,388 --> 00:40:13,685
It's fucking sad, man.

382
00:40:14,824 --> 00:40:17,520
Nevertheless, I do know the golden rule.

383
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,250
And what's that, sweetheart?

384
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:22,420
Fuck the gold.

385
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:30,300
He who has the nickel plating...

386
00:40:30,373 --> 00:40:31,806
...makes the rules.

387
00:40:31,874 --> 00:40:32,966
You shot him !

388
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:36,637
That's right, Gus.
Now, I'm going to kill him.

389
00:40:38,448 --> 00:40:39,574
Sweetheart.

390
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:49,755
Wrap him up.

391
00:40:53,296 --> 00:40:54,456
Wrap him up.

392
00:40:57,533 --> 00:40:58,966
Wrap him up!

393
00:41:06,142 --> 00:41:07,439
Fuck!

394
00:41:08,144 --> 00:41:09,702
-Anybody?
-No.

395
00:41:11,781 --> 00:41:15,080
We need some towels!
He's bleeding all over the place.

396
00:41:25,795 --> 00:41:26,921
Hey, Murph.

397
00:41:27,597 --> 00:41:30,088
How are we going to
split up the money now?

398
00:42:26,322 --> 00:42:29,291
Hey, this boy is heavy.

399
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:33,623
I think he had one too many peanut butter
and fried banana sandwiches.

400
00:43:01,557 --> 00:43:02,546
God!

401
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,129
Need a ride, fella?

402
00:43:46,836 --> 00:43:47,825
Thanks.

403
00:43:58,614 --> 00:43:59,603
Fuck!

404
00:44:31,447 --> 00:44:35,383
A raidas wild and as daring as
anything seen on the American landscape.

405
00:44:35,952 --> 00:44:40,286
The Riviera Hoteland Casino
exploded today in a shower of gunfire...

406
00:44:40,356 --> 00:44:43,223
...during the international Elvis Convention.

407
00:44:46,095 --> 00:44:47,323
Where's Jesse?

408
00:44:48,965 --> 00:44:50,728
Come here, you little shit!

409
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,097
What the hell....

410
00:44:54,737 --> 00:44:56,898
Where is it? Where is that damn money?

411
00:44:56,973 --> 00:45:00,932
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I'm calling the cops right now.

412
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:26,330
911 operator. Please state your name
and location of the emergency.

413
00:45:26,402 --> 00:45:27,562
Yes, hello.

414
00:45:27,803 --> 00:45:28,792
Hello?

415
00:45:31,207 --> 00:45:32,868
This is the 911 operator.

416
00:45:35,678 --> 00:45:37,077
Hello, ma 'am?

417
00:45:38,114 --> 00:45:39,274
Ma 'am?

418
00:45:40,916 --> 00:45:43,180
I thought you might change your mind.

419
00:45:45,221 --> 00:45:46,848
Where did you get that?

420
00:45:52,261 --> 00:45:56,630
You're the one. The casino in Vegas.
It's all over the news.

421
00:45:57,133 --> 00:45:57,997
That's you.

422
00:46:04,573 --> 00:46:06,666
-Get over there and sit down.
-Go.

423
00:46:20,189 --> 00:46:22,487
That's $100,000 in there.

424
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:24,993
Just for you to keep your mouth shut.

425
00:46:27,263 --> 00:46:29,731
You don't have to pay me off,
I won't tell anybody.

426
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:35,862
No, you're not.

427
00:46:37,473 --> 00:46:39,202
All I need is a couple of days.

428
00:46:39,275 --> 00:46:42,108
After that, you can do
whatever the hell you want.

429
00:46:45,114 --> 00:46:46,547
Everything is understood?

430
00:46:47,917 --> 00:46:48,941
I got it.

431
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,509
Well.

432
00:46:59,362 --> 00:47:00,488
Hey, Elvis.

433
00:47:03,999 --> 00:47:06,900
Is there any chance that
I might be able to see you again?

434
00:47:08,771 --> 00:47:10,136
Sorry, Cybil.

435
00:47:10,573 --> 00:47:12,404
Are you 100 percent sure of that?

436
00:47:12,808 --> 00:47:14,571
Yeah, 100,000 percent.

437
00:47:35,498 --> 00:47:37,466
-I need your car.
-What?

438
00:47:37,566 --> 00:47:40,501
Yeah, the old Valiant out there.
Where are the keys?

439
00:47:40,603 --> 00:47:42,434
I'm not giving that to you.

440
00:47:42,538 --> 00:47:45,405
Yeah, you are.
Because I just gave you $100,000 for it.

441
00:47:45,975 --> 00:47:48,273
I don't care how much you just gave me.

442
00:47:48,344 --> 00:47:50,676
Anyway, it's not my car.
It's my grandmother's.

443
00:47:51,647 --> 00:47:54,377
-You either give me the keys right now--
-Or what?

444
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:55,883
You're going to kill us?

445
00:47:56,118 --> 00:47:58,518
You know, there is a simple solution here.

446
00:47:58,587 --> 00:48:00,578
Yeah, there is.

447
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:02,923
You can take us with you.

448
00:48:04,393 --> 00:48:05,587
What?

449
00:48:05,928 --> 00:48:07,520
Why not? Where are you going?

450
00:48:08,297 --> 00:48:09,855
I haven't got time for this.

451
00:48:09,932 --> 00:48:12,127
You got three seconds to get me
those keys...

452
00:48:12,201 --> 00:48:15,136
...or I'll splatter cherry pie
on that wall behind you and...

453
00:48:15,204 --> 00:48:17,695
...l'm dead serious about that. One, two....

454
00:48:18,407 --> 00:48:20,170
Stop pointing that gun at my mom.

455
00:48:27,383 --> 00:48:28,748
Who's there?

456
00:48:29,218 --> 00:48:31,914
It's the police.
Can you open the door, please?

457
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:37,418
Mom, money!

458
00:48:39,462 --> 00:48:41,089
Sit down.

459
00:48:42,898 --> 00:48:44,422
Sit down!

460
00:48:47,169 --> 00:48:48,568
Mom, get the door.

461
00:48:51,707 --> 00:48:53,140
Can I help you?

462
00:48:53,242 --> 00:48:57,042
Evening. We received
an emergency 91 1 call from this room.

463
00:48:57,213 --> 00:48:58,441
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

464
00:48:58,514 --> 00:49:01,278
The call was disconnected.
We were in the neighborhood.

465
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:02,715
Everything okay?

466
00:49:03,285 --> 00:49:05,810
Yeah, it's fine.
We were just fixing to leave.

467
00:49:05,888 --> 00:49:07,480
Can we come in, ma'am?

468
00:49:08,557 --> 00:49:09,649
Of course you can.

469
00:49:10,059 --> 00:49:14,359
...Elvis impersonators made it up the
elevator and to the roof where they were...

470
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:17,399
...taken by helicopter,
we don't know where.

471
00:49:19,068 --> 00:49:20,968
Are you the man of the house?

472
00:49:22,404 --> 00:49:23,894
We just got engaged.

473
00:49:25,241 --> 00:49:28,176
-Congratulations.
-Thank you. We're really excited about it.

474
00:49:28,244 --> 00:49:30,439
We're about to go on a trip
to the Grand Canyon.

475
00:49:30,513 --> 00:49:33,380
-Jesse, why don't you go get your stuff?
-Okay.

476
00:49:35,451 --> 00:49:37,385
Well, I'll be right back.

477
00:49:40,356 --> 00:49:43,848
So, which of you is
the one who dialed 91 1?

478
00:49:53,602 --> 00:49:54,864
I'm sorry.

479
00:49:54,937 --> 00:49:59,135
I was trying to dial 41 1 for information
and I dialed 9 by mistake.

480
00:50:01,477 --> 00:50:03,570
Well, I guess we're all set here.

481
00:50:03,946 --> 00:50:06,176
-We'll be on our way.
-So are we.

482
00:50:06,382 --> 00:50:07,610
Come on.

483
00:50:09,785 --> 00:50:12,276
Ma'am, can I give you a hand
with your bag?

484
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:17,225
If you wouldn't mind. It's really heavy.
We got a lot of schoolbooks.

485
00:50:17,293 --> 00:50:18,988
It would be my pleasure.

486
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:22,654
We'll be right there.

487
00:50:27,403 --> 00:50:28,700
Come on.

488
00:50:39,882 --> 00:50:41,213
Bye-bye!

489
00:51:09,211 --> 00:51:11,145
You guys are federal marshals?

490
00:51:11,413 --> 00:51:14,405
If we're not,
we'd better give these fuckers back.

491
00:51:14,883 --> 00:51:16,214
Good morning.

492
00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:19,182
Not for them it isn't.

493
00:51:19,989 --> 00:51:21,854
'Morning. Vegas Homicide.

494
00:51:22,024 --> 00:51:23,355
What do you got, Vegas?

495
00:51:25,227 --> 00:51:26,660
No IDs.

496
00:51:26,996 --> 00:51:30,295
Looks like this one was digging,
trying to bury the one in the sheet.

497
00:51:30,366 --> 00:51:33,267
Someone drilled them from the front.
Double taps to the heart.

498
00:51:33,335 --> 00:51:36,202
Three spent .45 casings,
probably more in the sand.

499
00:51:37,106 --> 00:51:39,267
And this is interesting.

500
00:51:39,708 --> 00:51:41,676
.45 slug, slightly deformed.

501
00:51:43,812 --> 00:51:45,074
Vest.

502
00:52:14,576 --> 00:52:16,271
Tell me something, Cybil.

503
00:52:16,378 --> 00:52:18,846
How did that money get up there
in that ceiling?

504
00:52:18,914 --> 00:52:21,212
What do you mean? Jesse put it up there.

505
00:52:21,283 --> 00:52:24,150
It's a little heavy for him
to get up there all by himself.

506
00:52:24,553 --> 00:52:25,781
You're so paranoid.

507
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:28,948
Yeah, I'm paranoid, because I think
you tried to steal my money.

508
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:33,624
You don't deserve the money, anyway.
You're just an amateur.

509
00:52:33,696 --> 00:52:37,393
If you're such a pro, you know stealing it
wouldn't have done you any good.

510
00:52:37,466 --> 00:52:40,026
The money is marked,
Miss l-Got-lt-All-Figured-Out.

511
00:52:40,102 --> 00:52:42,229
-You're lying.
-Am l?

512
00:52:42,304 --> 00:52:44,534
The news said the money was untraceable.

513
00:52:44,606 --> 00:52:46,471
-The news?
-And the news doesn't lie.

514
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:48,066
I'm sure they said that.

515
00:52:48,143 --> 00:52:52,011
That way, when the idiots who stole it
try to spend it, they get caught.

516
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:54,447
You want to know why, Cybil with a "C"?

517
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:57,848
Because they were dumb shits
and they listened to the news.

518
00:52:59,788 --> 00:53:02,256
-I never thought about it that way.
-I guess not.

519
00:53:10,766 --> 00:53:15,135
All right, here we go. I'm pulling off here.
I can't drive anymore. I got to sleep.

520
00:53:52,007 --> 00:53:53,201
Can I help you?

521
00:53:54,409 --> 00:53:56,309
Can you pump gas?

522
00:53:57,379 --> 00:54:00,348
Good, because nobody does anymore.
Fill it up.

523
00:54:02,351 --> 00:54:04,319
You all be cool now.

524
00:54:08,023 --> 00:54:09,718
Man, what happened to your nose?

525
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:11,448
What happened to your hair?

526
00:54:13,428 --> 00:54:15,589
We just came from another interrogation.

527
00:54:15,664 --> 00:54:18,758
Which reminds me.
Quig, why do they call it a head-butt?

528
00:54:18,867 --> 00:54:22,633
It's not like I knocked that prick out
by slamming my forehead into his ass.

529
00:54:23,338 --> 00:54:24,430
Yeah, that's true.

530
00:54:26,441 --> 00:54:28,466
I would have come forward sooner...

531
00:54:28,544 --> 00:54:31,172
...but I was busy getting my beak mended.

532
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,840
I heard about the robbery after the surgery.

533
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:36,544
I put two and two together and here I am,
in the flesh.

534
00:54:36,618 --> 00:54:39,382
-I'll tell you what I told them other guys.
-Which is what?

535
00:54:40,322 --> 00:54:41,482
I knew one of them.

536
00:54:41,557 --> 00:54:43,718
You're certain of that?

537
00:54:44,059 --> 00:54:46,357
He's a real crazy motherfucker, too.

538
00:54:46,862 --> 00:54:48,090
He was...

539
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:50,131
...sinister, you know?

540
00:54:50,766 --> 00:54:53,428
Some creepy, freaky, level9 type shit.

541
00:54:54,837 --> 00:54:55,929
Dark.

542
00:54:56,138 --> 00:54:59,835
Kind that's liable to shove a little snake
up the coochies of women.

543
00:55:00,409 --> 00:55:02,707
Yeah, you better watch out for that one.

544
00:55:02,778 --> 00:55:06,043
Wherever he go, trouble bound to follow.

545
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:10,980
Oh, my God! Is he dead?

546
00:55:13,255 --> 00:55:15,314
Jumper cables might help.

547
00:55:15,724 --> 00:55:17,055
Did it hurt?

548
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:20,460
That's a funny question.

549
00:55:20,529 --> 00:55:21,928
Well, did it?

550
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:24,155
I think maybe the first one did.

551
00:55:24,833 --> 00:55:26,994
I could call the cops, you know.

552
00:55:29,671 --> 00:55:31,104
You could try.

553
00:55:43,085 --> 00:55:44,211
Allow me.

554
00:55:51,126 --> 00:55:52,991
Need some spot welding done?

555
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:54,858
This guy you seem to know so well:

556
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:59,026
-He's a real Elvis impersonator?
-No.

557
00:55:59,101 --> 00:56:02,229
-What does that mean?
-Remember when the King died in '77?

558
00:56:02,304 --> 00:56:04,238
Jesus, was it '77?

559
00:56:04,539 --> 00:56:07,633
He had a clause in his will
which stated that Lisa Marie...

560
00:56:07,709 --> 00:56:10,576
...along with any illegitimate child
he may have fathered...

561
00:56:10,646 --> 00:56:13,547
...be entitled to his entire estate.

562
00:56:15,699 --> 00:56:18,099
-Naturally.
-That's when I first met him.

563
00:56:18,234 --> 00:56:19,667
Did "him" have a name?

564
00:56:19,736 --> 00:56:21,533
Yeah! Murphy.

565
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:23,267
Thomas Murphy.

566
00:56:26,543 --> 00:56:28,101
Where are you headed?

567
00:56:30,547 --> 00:56:31,878
Can I come?

568
00:56:42,158 --> 00:56:43,455
Can l?

569
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:51,128
Go get your bubble gum.

570
00:57:02,645 --> 00:57:04,704
-Smoke?
-No.

571
00:57:05,315 --> 00:57:07,306
But I do everything else.

572
00:57:10,019 --> 00:57:11,850
It's a nasty habit.

573
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:48,455
Our music, rock'n 'rollmusic
is basically gospel or rhythm blues.

574
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:53,288
I did not try to steal your money!
