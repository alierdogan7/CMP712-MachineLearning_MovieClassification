00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:45,904
and they took our girls.

353
00:24:45,937 --> 00:24:48,134
That's basically what happened.

354
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:49,734
Very unfortunate.

355
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:51,702
Obviously not your fault.

356
00:24:51,743 --> 00:24:53,174
Just give me the arrest warrant.

357
00:24:53,207 --> 00:24:55,141
I'll take it up with my lawyers.

358
00:24:56,774 --> 00:24:59,918
- The warrant?
- Yeah, the arrest warrant.

359
00:24:59,951 --> 00:25:02,654
I'm sure you didn't let a bunch of cops
come in here and shut down my business

360
00:25:02,687 --> 00:25:04,318
without a legal arrest warrant.

361
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:06,591
They just came through the
front door locked and loaded.

362
00:25:06,624 --> 00:25:08,484

363

[grunting]

364
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,409
What I expect you to do
is what I pay you to do.

365
00:25:22,474 --> 00:25:25,610
[grunting]
Keep my club open.

366
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:27,649
Got that?

367
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,852

368
00:25:37,527 --> 00:25:39,493

370
00:25:42,762 --> 00:25:44,697
I want it open by tomorrow

371
00:25:44,762 --> 00:25:46,265
for lunch.

372
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:58,045
I don't know what we're
gonna do about this.

373
00:25:58,078 --> 00:26:00,085
We're gonna talk to the
insurance company again.

374
00:26:00,118 --> 00:26:01,980
They've gotta be
willing to pay for more.

375
00:26:02,021 --> 00:26:04,991
They say that Max's asthma
has a chronic condition limit,

376
00:26:05,024 --> 00:26:06,927
and if they don't think the
asthma's gonna get any better,

377
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,760
then they're not gonna
approve new treatment.

378
00:26:13,462 --> 00:26:16,332
We're just gonna have to pay
for the treatments ourselves.

379
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:18,834
Where are we gonna get cash like that?

380
00:26:23,431 --> 00:26:26,636
God damn it, how did I let
things get this screwed up?

381
00:26:35,905 --> 00:26:38,576
You're a good father, Gordon.

382
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:52,415
Juliet: They're not gonna
say anything about Proctor.

383
00:26:52,448 --> 00:26:54,985
They're more scared of him than you.

384
00:26:55,018 --> 00:26:56,650
And you're not?

385
00:26:56,691 --> 00:26:59,353
Proctor owns this whole town.

386
00:26:59,394 --> 00:27:01,224
He doesn't own me.

387
00:27:01,257 --> 00:27:03,359
<i>How about you?</i>

388
00:27:03,392 --> 00:27:05,191
[grunting]

389
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:11,299
No one owns me.

<i>Lucas: Okay.</i>

391
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:15,935

394
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:37,088
I see him three to four times a week.

395
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:41,193
- He pays you? - Mm-hmm,
but he calls them gifts.

396
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,530
And what would he do if you said no?

397
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:48,358
He'd get me fired from the
club and I need the money.

398
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,861
So, what do you want to tell me?

399
00:27:49,894 --> 00:27:53,267
If I gave you something on Proctor,

400
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,834
would you put him away?

401
00:27:54,868 --> 00:27:56,528
Could you even put him away?

402
00:27:56,601 --> 00:27:58,966
Depends what it is.

403
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:00,935
- Would I have to testify?
- Depends what it is.

404
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,332
Well, I won't testify, and
you have to promise me...

405
00:28:03,366 --> 00:28:05,604
- I can't promise you anything until I know what you've got.
- And he can't know it's me.

406
00:28:05,637 --> 00:28:07,940
Listen, I got a jail full
of whores I can do this with.

407
00:28:07,973 --> 00:28:09,371
And I have a...

408
00:28:09,404 --> 00:28:11,569
I have a son.

409
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:16,011
Fuck.

410
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:18,411
Listen, if what you've got is
big enough to put Proctor away,

411
00:28:18,452 --> 00:28:20,745
<i>I'll do everything I can
to keep you out of it.</i>

412
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:23,081
That's as close to a promise
as you're gonna get right now.

413
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:26,552
No?

414
00:28:26,585 --> 00:28:29,225
There was this guy I used to see.

415
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,426
[sniffles] A client.

416
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:36,191
He used to drive trucks for
Proctor, running X into Philly.

417
00:28:36,232 --> 00:28:38,928
- Ecstasy?
- He said Proctor has this place where they do it all...

418
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:41,202
<i>cook it, pack it, and ship it off.</i>

419
00:28:41,235 --> 00:28:42,369
You know his name?

420
00:28:44,904 --> 00:28:46,671
Matt Sharp.

421
00:28:48,272 --> 00:28:50,281
Where do I find him?

422
00:28:51,543 --> 00:28:52,878
Hey.

423
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:54,881
I'm looking for Matt Sharp.

424
00:28:54,914 --> 00:28:57,290
I'm Sharp.

425
00:28:57,321 --> 00:29:00,487
[laughs] Irony. Nice.

426
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,191
I need to talk to you for a minute.

427
00:29:02,224 --> 00:29:04,422
I'm on the clock, Sheriff.

428
00:29:04,455 --> 00:29:08,394
I don't know if you heard,
but the market's down,

429
00:29:08,435 --> 00:29:10,930
unemployment's at 9%.

430
00:29:10,971 --> 00:29:13,901
You wouldn't want to keep an honest
man from making a buck, would ya?

431
00:29:13,934 --> 00:29:15,673
An honest man, no.

432
00:29:15,706 --> 00:29:17,936
You? Eh, I could give a shit.

433
00:29:17,969 --> 00:29:20,743
<i>Brock: Listen, guys, we just got
a couple of questions for you.</i>

434
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:22,678
You're gonna want to put that down.

435
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:25,277
- Are you one of those affirmative action hires?
- Hey.

436
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,109
How do you like sitting in
the front seat versus the back?

437
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:28,381
Not as good as it'll feel

438
00:29:28,414 --> 00:29:30,181
when I put my boot up your
ass and out your mouth.

439
00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:32,083
- Whoa.
- Hey, we're just messing around.

440
00:29:32,116 --> 00:29:33,814
We didn't mean nothing by it.

441
00:29:33,847 --> 00:29:37,479
Yeah, spic, slope, coon, kike, faggot.

442
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,256

on, we dislike you all the same.

<i>Man: Yeah, what happened? Did you quit?</i>

448
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:51,429
Or did somebody figure out

449
00:29:51,462 --> 00:29:54,228
that a nigger running like he
stole something ain't nothing new?

450
00:29:54,261 --> 00:29:56,963

<i>Emmett: A verbal taunt does

<i>for self-defense, Sheriff,
only a life-threatening act.</i>

457
00:30:13,575 --> 00:30:16,279
And these little men aren't what
I'd consider to be threatening.

458
00:30:16,351 --> 00:30:18,781
Fuck you, O.J.

459
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:22,858
I do believe I now feel threatened.

460
00:30:22,891 --> 00:30:24,194
I would.

461
00:30:27,658 --> 00:30:29,834

00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:32,035

You okay, Brock?

466
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,593
No!

467
00:30:50,762 --> 00:30:52,961
Emmett, you need a hand?

468
00:30:52,994 --> 00:30:54,464
Oh, fuck.

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Slow down, Sharp.

473
00:31:26,031 --> 00:31:27,703
What do you want, cop?

474
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:30,101
You're gonna tell me about
Proctor's ecstasy operation.

475
00:31:33,068 --> 00:31:35,203
I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

476
00:31:35,244 --> 00:31:38,877
Okay.
[groans]

477
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,612
Let me get you started.

478
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:42,948
[coughing]
You were a driver.

479
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:45,082
You did runs from Banshee...

480
00:31:45,115 --> 00:31:46,714
[groans]

481
00:31:46,787 --> 00:31:48,281
...to Philly.

482
00:31:48,322 --> 00:31:50,089
Who told you that?

483
00:31:50,122 --> 00:31:53,391
<i>Well, that's none of your business.
[laughs]</i>

484
00:31:53,424 --> 00:31:56,562
You think I'm gonna roll on
someone like Proctor 'cause of you?

485
00:31:56,595 --> 00:31:58,793
Ah!

486
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:00,265
<i>Go ahead, arrest me.</i>

487
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:01,636
At least in jail I got my health.

488
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,834
Yeah, but right now... 
♪ I got your arm. ♪

489
00:32:04,867 --> 00:32:06,305
[yells] Stop!

490
00:32:06,337 --> 00:32:08,640
<i>- So tell me how it works.
- Fuck you.</i>

491
00:32:08,673 --> 00:32:11,135
[yells] Okay.

492
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:13,572
- I was just a driver.
- Yeah, we covered that.

493
00:32:13,605 --> 00:32:15,738
<i> Now, how did it work?
[yells]</i>

494
00:32:15,771 --> 00:32:17,138
It was always at night.

495
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:18,940
I'd pick up the trucks from the factory,

496
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:22,116
get 'em loaded, and then drive
from Banshee towards Philly.

497
00:32:22,213 --> 00:32:23,949
And?
[groans]

498
00:32:23,982 --> 00:32:26,548
All right. I'd have an address.

499
00:32:26,589 --> 00:32:28,786
Usually like some parking lot.

500
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:31,618
I'd leave the truck with the keys
in the cab and then walk away.

501
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:33,995
- And who took the trucks from there?
- I never saw anyone.

502
00:32:34,028 --> 00:32:35,563
The whole system's rigged with cutouts

503
00:32:35,596 --> 00:32:37,699
so no one knew more than they had to.

504
00:32:37,732 --> 00:32:39,163
But you got your orders
from Proctor, right?

505
00:32:39,196 --> 00:32:42,205
- I never even met him.
- Don't fuck with me, Sharp.

506
00:32:42,238 --> 00:32:44,608
Fuck, I'm not! I told
you, I don't know shit!

507
00:32:44,641 --> 00:32:47,078
I can't argue with that.
[groans]

508
00:32:47,143 --> 00:32:48,908
But you do know where the factory is.

509
00:32:48,941 --> 00:32:50,909
[yells]

510
00:32:50,942 --> 00:32:52,907
Oh, fuck, man.

511
00:32:52,948 --> 00:32:55,775
<i>Near the brick factory on Havershaw.</i>

512
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,615
[taps]
Thanks.

513
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,084
Hey.

514
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:08,914
We're out.

515
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:37,051
Well...

516
00:33:37,084 --> 00:33:39,852
look what the parole officer dragged in.

517
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,591
I missed you.

518
00:33:41,624 --> 00:33:43,360
Oh, honey, I know.

519
00:33:43,393 --> 00:33:45,392
But I come bearing gifts.

520
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,871
<i>Your cut from the truck job.</i>

521
00:33:53,904 --> 00:33:56,307
It's hardly retirement money...

522
00:34:01,949 --> 00:34:04,855
- You ain't gonna count it?
- I already know it won't be enough.

523
00:34:04,887 --> 00:34:07,160
Mm, you're telling me.

524
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,265
Enough for what?

525
00:34:12,298 --> 00:34:13,969
I need to do another one.

526
00:34:19,003 --> 00:34:20,439
And I need to stop risking my fine ass

527
00:34:20,472 --> 00:34:21,975
over motherfucking milk money.

528
00:34:22,008 --> 00:34:25,775
- This one's different.
- Oh, this one's different?

529
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:28,844
Then I'll gather the troops.

530
00:34:29,941 --> 00:34:31,979
It's gotta be just you and me.

531
00:34:33,611 --> 00:34:37,221
Now, we all agreed we were
gonna do this together.

532
00:34:37,254 --> 00:34:39,156
Moonlighting ain't my style.

533
00:34:39,189 --> 00:34:41,922
- I need this, Job.
- Join the motherfucking club.

534
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,858
[whispers] It's not for me.

535
00:34:46,363 --> 00:34:48,090
My son is sick.

536
00:34:55,338 --> 00:34:58,235
Mm.

537
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:01,010
Who do I have to shoot to get
a motherfucking menu in here?

540
00:35:28,435 --> 00:35:30,666
Yeah, that's what someone
wants you to think.

541
00:35:30,707 --> 00:35:34,940
They got cameras covering
the perimeter there, there.

542
00:35:34,981 --> 00:35:38,010
17-gauge wire along the fence line.

543
00:35:38,043 --> 00:35:40,146
It's electrified.

544
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:43,052
And they got motion sensors in the back.

545
00:35:44,621 --> 00:35:46,558
You can tell all that from here?

546
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:49,728
Yeah, more or less.

549
00:35:54,907 --> 00:35:57,043
Let's find out who owns the place.

550
00:35:57,076 --> 00:35:59,981
Oh, you mean do some actual
police work. Sounds good.

551

George: Throughout our history

552
00:36:15,928 --> 00:36:18,262
we have stood behind brave leaders

553
00:36:18,295 --> 00:36:20,700
who protected our culture and traditions

554
00:36:20,733 --> 00:36:23,636
<i>from a world that would see us gone.</i>

555
00:36:23,669 --> 00:36:27,942
Alex Longshadow comes from a
line of great Kinaho chiefs.

556
00:36:27,975 --> 00:36:30,143
<i>No one has done more for their people</i>

557
00:36:30,176 --> 00:36:32,109
than Benjamin Longshadow...

558
00:36:32,142 --> 00:36:36,613
which is why it saddens me
that it has come to this.

559
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,446
Alex simply lacks the
wisdom and experience

560
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,053
to lead the Kinaho tribe
in these complicated times.

561
00:36:49,718 --> 00:36:51,557
That is why it is with a heavy heart

562
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,421
<i>that I call for this
vote of no confidence</i>

563
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:58,633

564
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:02,337
All in favor, raise
their hand and say, "Aye."

565
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:20,755
Thompson, you're gonna let
some thug scare you away

566
00:37:20,788 --> 00:37:23,227
from the ideals of your ancestors?

567
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:28,267
Maybe we were too harsh in our judgment.

568
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,664
Alex is young and ambitious.

569
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,136
Young blood may be just
what this tribe needs.

570
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:46,076
You have corrupted this
council and shamed yourself

571
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:47,814
as well as your father.

572
00:37:47,847 --> 00:37:51,184
You gonna adjourn this meeting, or what?

573
00:38:08,293 --> 00:38:11,027
[sighs] What'd you do
to those guys, anyway?

574
00:38:12,366 --> 00:38:14,501
Your father was a man of great wisdom.

575
00:38:14,535 --> 00:38:16,238
He knew, like you now know,

576
00:38:16,271 --> 00:38:18,575
that sometimes the way over a mountain

577
00:38:18,608 --> 00:38:20,176
is through it.

578
00:38:20,209 --> 00:38:22,545
And...

579
00:38:22,578 --> 00:38:24,281
going through the mountain...

580
00:38:24,347 --> 00:38:26,588
well...

581
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:30,956
that's my specialty.

582
00:38:33,388 --> 00:38:35,723
Be well, Chief Longshadow.

583
00:38:39,999 --> 00:38:41,998
[sighs]

584
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:46,070
Property report lists the owner of the
warehouse and land as Wildflower, LLC.

585
00:38:46,111 --> 00:38:47,437
<i>Brock: It's probably a shell company.</i>

586
00:38:47,478 --> 00:38:48,772
Proctor's name is nowhere near it.

587
00:38:48,805 --> 00:38:50,644
<i>We'd pretty much have to catch Proctor</i>

588
00:38:50,677 --> 00:38:52,644
<i>in the warehouse personally
cooking up a batch of ecstasy</i>

589
00:38:52,677 --> 00:38:54,181
<i>in order to make the drug charges stick.</i>

590
00:38:54,214 --> 00:38:55,885
Doesn't mean we can't
shut the place down.

591
00:38:55,918 --> 00:38:58,349
Proctor'll have another one
up and running in a week.

592
00:38:58,382 --> 00:39:01,726
You want me to see what I
can find on the shell company?

593
00:39:02,655 --> 00:39:04,897
Uh, yeah. Might as well.

594
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,330
Hey, Emmett...

595
00:39:07,436 --> 00:39:10,065
sorry about what happened yesterday.

596
00:39:11,312 --> 00:39:13,306
You know, the shit at the junkyard.

597
00:39:13,343 --> 00:39:17,138
You know, every time I think
I'm immune to that stuff...

598
00:39:17,179 --> 00:39:19,839
I can only turn the other
cheek for so many times.

599
00:39:19,872 --> 00:39:23,216
But it gave me a chance to be a
good Christian and kick some butt.

600
00:39:24,713 --> 00:39:26,583
And how were you a good Christian?

601
00:39:29,255 --> 00:39:31,184
I forgave them afterwards.

602
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,982
<i>Lucas: Back to square one.</i>

603
00:39:57,015 --> 00:39:59,678
Is there some reason you
need to arrest Proctor today?

604
00:40:04,453 --> 00:40:07,357
<i>Lucas: Proctor does whatever
he wants to whoever he wants.</i>

605
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:11,061
Every day that list
gets a little bit longer.

606
00:40:11,094 --> 00:40:12,726
Been like that since
before you got here.

607
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:15,030
That doesn't mean it stays the same way.

Hands behind your back.

612
00:40:29,249 --> 00:40:32,187
Hands behind your back. Do it!

613
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,020
- Who's left in the warehouse?
- Nobody.

614
00:40:34,053 --> 00:40:36,325
Do you know whose shit you're stealing?

615
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:37,860
Who says we're stealing it?

617
00:40:40,294 --> 00:40:44,570
Listen, there's a right way
and a wrong way to get Proctor.

618
00:40:45,771 --> 00:40:47,307
So, you can drive this?

619
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,875
Shit, back in the day,

620
00:40:48,908 --> 00:40:51,882
I used to run a big rig
cross-country in 92 hours.

621

00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,226
You sure you want to do this?

625
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:04,963
Go up against Proctor like this?

626
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:08,931
You got your issues
with Proctor, I got mine.

627
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,870
This is a war. This
isn't about one battle.
