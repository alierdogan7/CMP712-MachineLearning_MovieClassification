879
02:13:45,685 --> 02:13:47,727
I wish you hadn't come here.

880
02:13:58,364 --> 02:14:00,281
Are you fond of crayfish?

881
02:14:31,939 --> 02:14:33,356
Good.

882
02:14:34,942 --> 02:14:36,693
You really think so?

883
02:14:36,861 --> 02:14:40,530
It's the best I've had in years.

884
02:14:46,328 --> 02:14:47,829
Did you hear about my wife?

885
02:14:49,540 --> 02:14:53,668
She married my attorney,
or else he married her...

886
02:14:53,836 --> 02:14:57,172
...although, actually,
it doesn't really matter.

887
02:14:57,339 --> 02:15:01,509
I mean, it all works out to the same thing,
don't you think?

888
02:15:07,725 --> 02:15:12,437
Well, I have not heard from her
in about...

889
02:15:13,856 --> 02:15:16,524
It is nice here, isn't it?

890
02:15:17,276 --> 02:15:20,153
You've made it nice, Louis.

891
02:15:21,197 --> 02:15:23,114
Really nice.

892
02:15:26,035 --> 02:15:28,203
Funny...

893
02:15:28,871 --> 02:15:31,706
...you and me ending up here.

894
02:15:32,917 --> 02:15:35,627
We're the only ones left.

895
02:15:38,464 --> 02:15:41,382
- Do you ever wonder about it?
- No.

896
02:15:43,219 --> 02:15:44,886
I do.

897
02:15:47,848 --> 02:15:49,724
Get away!

898
02:15:51,602 --> 02:15:54,562
Get away! Get away!

901
02:16:11,330 --> 02:16:12,580
Who does?

902
02:16:18,254 --> 02:16:21,589
- Maybe I better go.
- Yes.

903
02:16:24,844 --> 02:16:28,972
I know your house.
There's no ghost in it.

904
02:17:04,091 --> 02:17:06,467
My thoughts are with you.

905

02:18:09,615 --> 02:18:13,076
Come look. Remember those seeds
that Sergeant Santini gave me last month?

908
02:18:13,243 --> 02:18:15,328
- They've come up. We'll have carrots.
- Louis.

909
02:18:15,496 --> 02:18:18,289
It said six weeks on the packet,
but it's only taken four.

910
02:18:18,457 --> 02:18:22,085
If I could find a way to get off this island,
would you like to come with me?

911
02:18:22,252 --> 02:18:23,544
Oh, yes, of course.

912
02:18:23,712 --> 02:18:27,173
Get away. Freddie, you know better
than that. Get away.

913
02:18:28,717 --> 02:18:31,886
- I got no money. They took it all.
- Forget about that.

914
02:18:32,054 --> 02:18:34,430
- You can't buy your way out of here.
- Then how?

915
02:18:36,392 --> 02:18:37,433
I don't know yet.

916
02:18:37,893 --> 02:18:41,396
Then we don't have to discuss it.
Tell me, do you like tomatoes?

917
02:18:41,563 --> 02:18:45,692
I have some extra seeds.

You see? It's a horseshoe.

920
02:19:13,595 --> 02:19:16,472
When the waves break,
they have no place else to go...

921
02:19:16,640 --> 02:19:18,474
...except go back out again.

922
02:19:18,642 --> 02:19:21,853
Well, you can't launch a boat from here.

923
02:19:22,021 --> 02:19:25,773
In fact, there's no place on the entire island
where you can launch a boat.

924
02:19:25,983 --> 02:19:29,777
Bags of coconuts tied together,
just throw them over...

...float out on a wave.

926
02:19:33,991 --> 02:19:35,992

- You're certain?
- Yeah.

02:19:49,298 --> 02:19:52,842
Seems so... Ha, ha, so desperate.

Does it matter?

02:20:07,524 --> 02:20:10,485
Get. Get. Now, that's not yours.

935
02:20:10,652 --> 02:20:11,694
Now, you get away.

02:20:11,862 --> 02:20:15,031
I'm not going to tell you again.
Here you are, Freddie.

Freddie, that's not for you.
That's Adam's.

- Let's take a walk.
- Certainly.

02:20:40,599 --> 02:20:43,017
Isn't that a little small?

946
02:20:43,519 --> 02:20:46,938
- It's just to try it with.
- Certainly.

You know, I've been thinking
of building a porch.

There's not a home on the entire island
with a porch.

Not even Sergeant Santini has a porch.

- What do you think, huh?
- Come on.

951
02:23:29,518 --> 02:23:31,269
It was the wrong wave.

952
02:23:32,980 --> 02:23:35,314
Oh, yeah.

953
02:23:35,941 --> 02:23:38,234
They come in a series of seven.

954
02:23:38,402 --> 02:23:40,695
And the seventh wave is big enough...

955
02:23:40,862 --> 02:23:43,531
...to take us both out
beyond the point of return.

- Yeah.
