1
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,235
- Jacob was a good farmer.
- But not the man to buy your horse.

2
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,197
Hochleitner, wasn't it your father sold
him a horse with the ruptured testicle?

3
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,952
- "A bee sting made him limp that way."
- That horse had one good ball.

4
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,991
That's all it takes.

5
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,274
Rachel ...

6
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,310
I'm sorry about Jacob.
I know he'll walk with God.

7
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,118
Thank you, Daniel.

8
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,193
- Daniel.
- Good morning.

9
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,909
So, first time to the big city?.

10
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,396
You'll see so many things.

11
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,832
Close your eyes.

12
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,960
Open.

13
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,312
Samuel, careful!

14
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,876
You come back soon.

15
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,078
Samuel!

16
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,513
Samuel ...

17
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,670
You be careful out among the English.

18
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,357
Mama, look!

19
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,070
Oh, he's a cute little Amish boy.

20
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,676
We have tickets to Baltimore.
Where is that train?

21
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,917
It's delayed three hours. You'll hear it
announced when it's time to board.

22
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,911
Just take a seat over there.
I have to wait on these people.

23
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,239
Mama, look. What's that thing?

24
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,640
Don't go far, Samuel.

25
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,994
Mama ...

26
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,237
It's over there.

27
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,632
Hey, man.

28
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:46,517
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Washing my hands, man.

29
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,718
- Let's get out of here.
- Hold tight.

30
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,156
I already did that.

31
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,752
Let's check it again.

32
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,751
Move these people back.

33
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,918
Get Schaeffer down here, now.

34
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,511
Who found the body?.
How you doing? You found the body?.

35
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,359
- I just reported it. It was the kid.
- What kid?

36
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,838
How do I know what kid?
The kid in the funny black threads.

37
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,391
How's he doing?

38
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,797
I'm a police officer.
I have to talk to the boy.

39
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,195
What's your name?

40
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,194
Samuel.

41
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,234
- Samuel Lapp.
- And he's your son?

42
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,555
We were on our way to Baltimore.
Soon our train is leaving.

43
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,876
We'll get you on another train.

44
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,117
Sam, the man who was killed tonight -

45
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,393
- was a policeman.
It's my job to find out what happened.

46
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,671
I want you to tell me
everything you saw in the bathroom.

47
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,349
There were two.
I only saw one.

48
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,109
- Does anybody know about this?
- No, nobody's talked to him.

49
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,676
What did he look like,
the man that you saw?.

50
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,556
- He was like him.
- A black man?

51
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,993
- He had black skin?
- Yes, but not stumpig.

52
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,270
What's stumpig?

53
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,350
On a farm, when a pig is born small
like that, he's stumpig. A runt.

54
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,314
So he wasn't a runt.

55
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,271
- He was a big guy, like me?
- Big guy.

56
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,475
- Where are you taking us?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

57
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,800
We're looking for a suspect. I want
the little boy to take a look at him.

58
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,230
You have no right to keep us here.

59
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,948
Yes, I do. Your son's a material witness
to a homicide.

60
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,357
You don't understand.
We want nothing to do with your laws.

61
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,634
Doesn't surprise me.
A lot of people I meet are like that.

62
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,348
- What did he say?.
- He asked who you are. Your name.

63
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,950
I told him we didn't need to know
anything about you.

64
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,877
Book.
John Book.

65
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,114
Where are you going?

66
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,359
- Looking good, T-Bone.
- What the fuck ..?

67
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,599
Is this the man, Sam? ls this him?
You're sure?

68
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,949
- Back off!
- We want no further part of this.

69
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,479
Okay. Get back in the car.

70
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,996
Hey, honest mistake, all right?

71
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,636
What are we gonna do with them?
A hotel?

72
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:15,678
No, they won't be there in the morning.
We'll have to get them in Baltimore.

73
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,638
I got it.

74
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,837
This is my sister, Elaine.
This is Mrs Lapp and Samuel.

75
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:28,114
- Where do they go, the blue room?
- Sure, the blue room.

76
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,199
- Can I help you with something?
- No.

77
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,875
Right back there, Sam.

78
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,356
- How could you do this to me tonight?
- It's important.

79
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,315
Just keep going straight through.
There's a folding cot for your son.

80
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,319
- I told you I had company!
- Are Jason and Billy asleep?

81
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,389
- And you got a man in the house?
- That's none of your business.

82
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,991
Anyway, they like Fred.
Who are these orphans, anyway?.

83
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,156
They're Amish.

84
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,829
- Everything okay?.
- Yes, thank you.

85
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,474
- John says you're Amish.
- Yes.

86
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,313
Oh ...

87
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,716
- Do we have to stay here?
- No, we don't. Just for the night.

88
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,276
Say your prayers.

89
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,829
- Hey, Captain.
- Hey, Bob.

90
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:01,589
- When can we leave the city?.
- I'll try to get this over with quickly.

91
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,917
But Samuel will have to come back
and testify. I'm sorry.

92
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,752
No, you're not. You're glad.
Because now you have a witness.

93
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,158
I just don't like my son spending time
with a man who carries a gun -

94
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,157
- and goes around whacking people.

95
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,634
"Whacking"?

96
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,437
Come here, kiddo.

97
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,874
Big guy ...

98
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,912
You can see them,
but they can't see you.

99
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,671
I want the hats and sunglasses off.
Straighten up.

100
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,039
Tell me if any of these men
are the man you saw in the bathroom.

101
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,597
Take your time.
Look real carefully.

102
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,119
Make sure.
Are you sure?

103
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,474
Okay.

104
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,639
- Three dogs to stay.
- Thank you.

105
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,351
- These we call Wurst.
- Good, good.

106
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,789
Your sister said
you don't have a family.

107
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,431
No, I don't.

108
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,633
She thinks you should have
children of your own, -

109
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,355
- instead of trying
to be a father to hers.

110
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:08,075
Except she thinks you're afraid
of the responsibility.

111
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,555
- That's interesting. Anything else?
- Yeah ...

112
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,550
She says she thinks you like policing
because you think you're always right.

113
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,593
And that you're the only one
who can do anything.

114
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:30,750
And that, when you drink a lot of beer,
you say things like:

115
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,752
"None of the other police know a crook
from a bag of ... elbows."

116
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,951
I believe that's what she said.

117
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,396
Good appetite.

118
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,797
Captain, Sgt. Carter for you
on line 23.

119
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,558
Hey, how are you doing?

120
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,159
- I don't know.
- Little boy ... He's shy.

121
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,236
Hey, knock it off!

122
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,037
I'll get it.

123
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,356
- Hi, Kathy.
- Dad!

124
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,120
- Hello, Marilyn.
- Hi, John.

125
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,039
It's McFee, Paul. He's one of them.
Positive ID from the Amish kid.

126
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,673
- McFee? Lieutenant, Narcotics?
- Right.

127
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,872
I hope you don't have any doubt
about that.

128
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:32,837
It fits. Four years ago, Narcotics runs
a raid in which, among other things, -

129
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,350
- 550 gallons of this P2P stuff
is confiscated.

130
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,150
They put it in Police Storage.

131
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,238
Philadelphia supplies
all the major cities with speed.

132
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,878
They need this P2P stuff to make it.
They pay up to $5,000 a pint for it.

133
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,799
I call Police Storage ...

134
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,231
No record of ten 55-gallon drums
of P2P.

135
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,238
That's $22 million.

136
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,078
Guess who ran the raid four years ago.

137
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,319
McFee ...
Have you talked to him about it?

138
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,193
No. Vacation. Florida.

139
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,509
- What do you need to clean this up?
- People from outside the department.

140
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,190
Put some guys on McFee.
Watch him, wait him out.

141
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,437
FBl, or maybe someone from Treasury.
I'll take care of that.

142
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,236
I want maximum security on this.
The boy's gonna have to be moved.

143
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,954
- Who else knows about this?
- Just you and I.

144
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,554
Get back! Police!
Back in the elevator!

145
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,191
- That's our car!
- Get in the elevator, you idiot!

146
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,554
I know you, asshole!

147
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:21,670
John says you have to leave now.
He says it's urgent. Dress quickly.

148
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,873
John?

149
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,632
Put my car in the garage
and close the door.

150
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,356
- I don't understand any of this.
- You don't know anything, okay?.

151
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,712
I borrowed your car. I didn't say why.

152
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,549
You never heard of that woman
and her boy.

153
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,959
- John, please tell me why.
- Just do it.

154
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:54,553
- You said we'd be safe in Philadelphia.
- Well, I was wrong.

155
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,232
Did you deliver the kid's interview
to Schaeffer?.

156
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,592
- No.
- I want all the paperwork to disappear.

157
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,759
- Tonight, you understand?
- Do you know what you're asking?

158
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,715
Just do it. I'm gonna disappear
for a couple of days.

159
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,516
- John, what is happening?
- I'll call you when I can.

160
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,158
And, partner, watch your back.
Schaeffer's in this thing too.

161
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,468
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Working late, man.

162
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,312
That's it.

163
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,078
Hey, Fergie ...
I told you I hit him.

164
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,751
He's in trouble. I want to help him.
We just need to know where he is.

165
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,670
- What kind of trouble?
- A police matter. Don't worry about it.

166
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,876
You're saying he's involved
in something illegal?

167
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,719
Anybody who knows John
knows that's a goddamn lie.

168
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:49,199
Of course it is. But as long as there's
any doubt, it's better he clear his name.

169
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,312
It's better you should get off my porch.

170
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:58,311
I don't want to have to take you in.
He left with the Amish woman, right?

171
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,713
- She say where he is?
- She doesn't know. What about Carter?.

172
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,230
Tight ... but I'm working on him.

173
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,519
Samuel!

174
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,429
You should rest.
I'll make us some coffee.

175
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,756
No, I can't stay.

176
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,554
- Will you be taking Samuel to trial?
- There isn't gonna be any trial.

177
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:21,117
Rachel, what happened?
Who was that man?

178
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,112
- Why didn't you go to a hospital?
- No doctor.

179
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,232
They have to report gunshot wounds.

180
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,911
If they make a report, they find me.
And if they find me, they find the boy.

181
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,430
- Is the English dead?
- No.

182
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,472
He's upstairs.

183
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,670
I feel burning.

184
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:34,510
The bullet entered there
and came out there.

185
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,839
There's danger of infection.
He's lost a great deal of blood.

186
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,875
I am not a doctor. This man
should be treated in a hospital.

187
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:51,473
- There is nothing I can do for him.
- No! No, he must stay here.

188
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,435
What if he dies? The sheriff will come.
They'll say we broke the laws.

189
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:02,430
Then we must pray that he doesn't die.
If he does, no one must know.

190
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,598
But this is a man's life.
We hold it in our hands.

191
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,156
God help me, I know that, Eli.

192
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,558
But if he is found, the people who
did this to him will come get Samuel.

193
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:24,873
Then make a poultice, three parts milk,
two parts linseed oil, for the infection.

194
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:30,029
I will send Mary by with some teas
I will brew myself.

195
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,514
Thank you.

196
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,797
- I'll have to speak with the elders.
- As you see fit.

197
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,359
You prick...

198
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,994
Don't do it.

199
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,839
I'll fucking kill you.

200
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,996
You asshole ...

201
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,957
John.

202
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,913
John.

203
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,037
Are you saying there's no way
we can locate this woman?

204
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,391
We're talking about
20th-century law enforcement.

205
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:42,630
There's yourproblem. YourAmishman
doesn't live or think in the 20th century.

206
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,071
If the Amish have taken yourman in,
he won'tbe easy to find.

207
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,989
The problem is, about every third
Amishman around here is named Lapp.

208
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:55,752
And we've got 14,000 Amishmen
justin this county...

209
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,999
That's very interesting, Sergeant,
but this is a very important matter.

210
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,431
It involves the murder
of a police officer.

211
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:09,988
- There must be some sort of directory.
- Sure. Tax rolls, voter registration ...

212
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,998
But I don't have the manpower
to send a deputy -

213
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,033
- to everyLapp farm in the county.

214
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,519
- Maybe you could use the telephone.
- Yeah, maybe I could ...

215
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,439
But since the Amish don't have phones,
I wouldn't know who to call.

216
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,235
Thank you, Sergeant.
It's been an education.

217
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,149
- Who are they?.
- The leadership of our district.

218
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,158
They decided to come see you
for themselves.

219
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:02,070
Except Stoltzfus. He came the first day.
I think he saved your life.

220
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,078
No, that was not I.

221
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,832
- Who else knows I'm here?
- No one.

222
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,110
- How long have I been here?
- Two days.

223
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,514
Rest, Mr Book. That's the ticket.

224
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,679
And drink my tea.
Lots of my tea.

225
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:38,113
- Tell him his tea stinks.
- You can tell him when you're able.

226
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,920
We're happy you'll live. We didn't know
what we'd do with you if you died.

227
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:05,199
It's not our place
to ask how he came to us.

228
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,513
Don't move!

229
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,236
What are you doing?

230
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,677
Come here, Samuel.
Sit down.

231
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:06,111
This is a loaded gun.
This is very, very dangerous.

232
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,199
Never, ever, touch a loaded gun.

233
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,753
Now I'm taking the bullets out.
Now it's safe. Okay?.

234
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,156
- Okay, Mr Book.
- Look, you can call me John.

235
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:25,558
I just don't want you to get hurt.
I didn't mean to yell at you.

236
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,712
It's all right for you to look at it
now. It's unloaded. It's safe.

237
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:37,189
You wanna handle it, you can handle it,
while I'm here. But that's not right.

238
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,840
Samuel, wait for me downstairs.

239
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,393
John Book, while you are in this house,
I insist that you respect our ways.

240
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:07,277
Here, take it. Put it somewhere
where he won't find it.

241
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,471
This gun of the hand
is for the taking of human life.

242
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,391
We believe it is wrong to take life.

243
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,398
That is only for God.

244
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,909
Many times the wars have come,
and people have said to us:

245
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,430
"You must fight, you must kill."

246
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,837
"It is the only way
to preserve the good."

247
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,276
But Samuel ...

248
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,269
There is never only one way.
Remember that.

249
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,789
Would you kill another man?

250
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,833
I would only kill a bad man.

251
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,679
Only the bad man, I see.

252
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,429
And you know these bad men by sight?

253
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,998
You are able to look into their hearts
and see this badness?

254
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:23,354
I can see what they do.
I have seen it.

255
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:28,918
And having seen, you become
one of them. Don't you understand?

256
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,234
What you take into your hands ...

257
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,680
... you take into your heart.

258
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:44,114
"Wherefore come out from
among them, and be ye separate, -

259
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,515
- saith the Lord."

260
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,157
"And touch not the unclean thing."

261
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:59,111
- Go and finish your chores now.
- Yes, Grandfather.

262
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:15,675
- Enjoying your reading?
- Yeah, I'm learning a lot about manure.

263
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,916
Very interesting.

264
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,194
What's that?

265
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,915
Your clothes were stained with blood.
You can wear these.

266
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,350
- They're your husband's?
- Yes.

267
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,233
It's good that someone
can have the use of them.

268
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,479
Besides, in your clothes
you'd stand out to strangers.

269
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:51,309
I should tell you that
this kind of coat doesn't have buttons.

270
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,999
- See? Hooks and eyes.
- Something wrong with buttons?

271
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:01,399
Buttons are Hochmut.
Proud, vain. It's not plain.

272
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,394
Got anything against zippers?

273
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,554
- Are you making fun of me?
- No.

274
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:19,159
Like the tourists ...
staring all the time.

275
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,112
Sometimes they come into the yard.
It's very rude.

276
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:30,959
- They seem to think we're quaint.
- I can't imagine why they'd think that.

277
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,911
Is there a phone somewhere near?.

278
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,310
The Gunthers across the valley.
They're Mennonites.

279
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,672
- They have cars, refrigerators ...
- I mean a pay phone, a public phone.

280
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,191
The store at Strasburg, but you won't
be going to Strasburg for a while.

281
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,630
I'm going this morning.

282
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:58,037
- But Stoltzfus said ...
- Yeah, I know what he said.

283
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,519
You can go with Eli.
He's taking Samuel to school.

284
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,279
- But you'd better hurry.
- Rachel ...

285
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,079
Nothing.

286
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,674
What?

287
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:47,270
- Hurry up, John Book.
- You'd better get going.

288
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,350
Hurry up, John Book.

289
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,037
My gun. I need my gun.

290
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,919
Thanks.

291
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,196
The bullets?
It's not much good without them.

292
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,952
Of course.

293
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,032
Thank you.

294
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,276
How do I look?.
I mean, do I look Amish?

295
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,111
- You look plain.
- Okay.

296
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,670
- Carter.
- Partner, are you okay?

297
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,598
Yeah. You?

298
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:52,432
- I'm coming in. How hot am l?
- Too hot. Don't do it.

299
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,634
- Don't come in. They're looking for you.
- And the kid. I have to make a move.

300
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:03,710
John, don't do it. You couldn't get
within a mile of Schaeffer right now.

301
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,151
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

302
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,790
What are we gonna do? FBl?

303
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:17,158
- Maybe.
- What about an investigative reporter?

304
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,999
No, they'd want to talk to the kid.

305
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:24,193
Listen, I'll make a couple of calls,
let you know when you can come in.

306
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,757
- I've got to go. Take care of yourself.
- Yeah, you too.

307
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,354
Here ...

308
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,429
Don't put them in the peaches.

309
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,794
See this stream?
It goes to the wheel -

310
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,073
- and it makes the wheel turn around.
Then it goes ...

311
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:24,356
It makes this wire
pump the pump over there, -

312
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:30,192
- into the well, and the well's water
goes into the house.

313
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:38,398
This place really echoes.
Hello!

314
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,874
- What's up there?
- Corn.

315
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,154
Would you like to hold my kitten?

316
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,318
I'll show you how to do a back rub.

317
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:55,709
You hold them like that, push their
head back, and you rub their neck.

318
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:06,071
Book?.
Is that you, Book?.

319
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,630
What are you doing there?

320
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,749
I'm just trying to get the car started.

321
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,919
If you are well enough to do that,
you can do work for me.

322
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,793
Yeah. What can I do?

323
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,470
Milking, maybe ...
Cows, you know. Cows.

324
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,550
Yeah, I've seen pictures.

325
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,354
Good. You start tomorrow.

326
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,472
It's 4:30, time for milking.

327
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,788
Milking stool, milking hat.
There's the milk.

328
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,918
Firm grip.
Pinch the top off and squeeze.

329
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:49,119
- Didn't you hear me? Squeeze.
