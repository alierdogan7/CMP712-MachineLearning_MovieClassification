...I gotta get out before the cops show.
What is that?

338
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,752
They hit three holdup alarm systems.

339
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,046
Two telco and a cellular.

340
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,843
See, but the signals
aren't going anywhere because...

341
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:43,849
See, the night before, you cut in
and trick out the alarm-system computer...

342
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:49,604
...to turn itself and the video recorders off
20 minutes before you walk in the door.

100 percent from the insurance company...

352
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,140
...and take the bonds from us
at 60 cents on the dollar...

353
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,392

Everybody makes out.

if everyone gets their underwear in a twist.

Wrong. You know why?

668
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,418
Because you prefer the normal routine:

669

We fuck,
then you lose the power of speech.

670
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,507
Because I gotta hold on to my angst.

A container facility?

835
01:19:57,542 --> 01:20:02,087
- For a can'tage theft?
- Too visible. Too lowball for them.

836
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:08,219
Next door's an oil refinery,
over there's a scrap yard.

837
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:11,055
Refinery only pays by check.
No cash around.

838
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:12,890
Same for the scrap yard.

839
01:20:16,394 --> 01:20:18,604
Maybe they're stealing hubcaps.

840
01:20:21,858 --> 01:20:25,069
A refinery and a scrap yard.

841
01:20:25,403 --> 01:20:29,073
- What the hell is going on?
- That's what we're trying to figure out.

842
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:32,076
We thought we had it.

843
01:20:32,869 --> 01:20:33,911
Thought we had it.

844
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:48,133
I got an idea
of what they were looking at.

845
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:54,348
- You wanna know what they're looking at?
- What?

846
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:59,144
I mean, is this guy something,
or is he something?

867

He's taken down some heavy crews.
Blew away Frankie Yonder in Chicago.

868
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:45,793
And he was a fucking maniac.

869
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:50,214
He was working Narcotics before that.
Had some problems, divorced twice.

870

He's why the extra heat.

...says Hanna likes you.

Thinks you're some kind of star.
You do this sharp, you do that sharp.

01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:07,898

What the fuck do you think that means?
He likes staying home?

01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:18,409

out there...

880

"Don't let yourself get attached
to anything...

01:30:44,814 --> 01:30:47,524
...you are not willing to walk out on

...and all the victims of all the murders
I ever worked are sitting at this table...

955
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:14,110
...and they're staring at me
with these black eyeballs...

956
01:32:14,278 --> 01:32:19,282
...because they got eight-ball hemorrhages
from the head wounds.

957
01:32:19,617 --> 01:32:23,119
And there they are,
these big balloon people...

958
01:32:23,287 --> 01:32:26,373
...because I found them two weeks
after they'd been under the bed.

959
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:30,043
The neighbors reported the smell...

960
01:32:30,586 --> 01:32:34,589
...and there they are,
all of them just sitting there.

961
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:37,342
What do they say?

962
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:40,804
Nothing.

963
01:32:40,972 --> 01:32:42,639
- No talk?
- None.

964
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:46,434
Just...
They don't have anything to say.

965
01:32:47,061 --> 01:32:49,479
See, we just look at each other.

966
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:54,776
They look at me.
And that's it, that's the dream.

967
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:59,531
I have one where I'm drowning.

968
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:03,368
And I gotta wake myself up
and start breathing, or I'll die in my sleep.

969
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:06,955
You know what that's about?

970
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:10,166
Yeah. Having enough time.

971
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:16,923
- Enough time to do what you wanna do?
- That's right.

972
01:33:18,884 --> 01:33:22,512
- You doing it now?
- No, not yet.

973
01:33:27,393 --> 01:33:29,686
You know, we're sitting here...

01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:32,647
...you and I,
like a couple of regular fellows.

01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:35,734
You do what you do,
and I do what I gotta do.

976
01:33:38,029 --> 01:33:41,031
And now that we've been face to face...

977
01:33:43,326 --> 01:33:48,330
...if I'm there and I gotta put you away,
I won't like it.

01:33:52,376 --> 01:33:55,879

and some poor bastard...

...whose wife you're gonna
turn into a widow...

981
01:33:59,383 --> 01:34:03,720
...brother, you are going down.

01:34:15,441 --> 01:34:18,276
There's a flip side to that coin.

983
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:24,407
What if you do got me boxed in
and I gotta put you down?

984
01:34:25,701 --> 01:34:30,413
Because no matter what,
you will not get in my way.

985
01:34:31,123 --> 01:34:34,042
We've been face to face, yeah...

986
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:40,757
...but I will not hesitate.
Not for a second.

987
01:34:46,597 --> 01:34:48,932
Maybe that's the way it'll be.

988
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:53,895
Or who knows?

989
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:56,856
Or maybe
we'll never see each other again.

990
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:13,915
They dumped us.

991
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:16,543
What?

992
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:20,004
- They dumped us.
- What do you mean, they dumped us?

993
01:35:20,172 --> 01:35:21,256

994
01:35:21,424 --> 01:35:23,883
He doesn't talk about scores
with Charlene...

995
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:26,761
...so there's nothing for me to get
from Marciano. I tried.

996
01:35:27,179 --> 01:35:29,180
- What about Cheritto?

998

- Yeah, at the same time. Nine p.m.

999
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:43,319

half an hour ago!

1000
01:35:43,487 --> 01:35:45,822
We were on you.
Then McCauley drives into LAX...

1001

...where surveillance can't fly over
because of flight paths.

1002

His car's still there. He's gone.

1003
01:35:56,917 --> 01:36:02,881
