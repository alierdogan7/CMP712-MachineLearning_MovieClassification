1
00:00:-29,-783 --> 00:00:-26,-709
2
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:38,608
Good evening, gentlemen.
Can I check your hats, please?

3
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,548
Gentlemen?

4
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,008
Gentlemen.

5
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,294
Got caught like a bear trap.

6
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:55,809
You wanna play or do you wanna pay?
I got a great girl.

7
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:58,689
Jack Flynn?

8
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:02,569
Here you go, buddy.
Buy yourself a good time.

9
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:06,649
- They'll let anybody in here.
- Mr. Flynn, I'm Maxwell Hoover.

10
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:09,049
I'm with the Los Angeles
Police Department.

11
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:11,929
That means I get change back.

12
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,015
Are you still here?

13
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,855
What is it gonna cost me?

14
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,015
I came here to deliver a message.

15
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,615
Your presence is required
back in Chicago.

16
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,130
It's cold in Chicago,
which is why I came out here.

17
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:26,330
Is Mr. Flynn being charged
with a crime?

18
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:27,975
What are you, his lawyer?

19
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,770
No, but I'm represented by a good one.

20
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:33,530
What's my friend being charged with?

21
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,496
He did things in Chicago.

22
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:38,411
I beat all that, pal.
I beat those indictments.

23
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:45,731
Jimmy, hit him in the nuts!

24
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:50,271
Let's go.
Get him outta here.

25
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:52,211
You guys are making a big mistake.

26
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:03,492
Where are we going?

27
00:05:03,527 --> 00:05:05,897
The airport.

28
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:08,777
You're going to the airport, Jack.

29
00:05:08,812 --> 00:05:11,692
You gotta get back to Chicago
as soon as possible.

30
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:16,172
This ain't the way to the airport.

31
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,938
This is it.

32
00:05:32,973 --> 00:05:35,613
Yeah. This is it.

33
00:05:35,648 --> 00:05:38,218
This is what?

34
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:40,934
This is Mulholland Falls, Jack.

35
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:43,779
Mulholland Falls?

36
00:05:43,814 --> 00:05:46,694
It's kinda like Niagara Falls.

37
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:51,214
Come on!
There ain't no falls in L.A.

38
00:05:59,454 --> 00:06:02,334
You guys can't do this.
This is America.

39
00:06:03,175 --> 00:06:06,055
This isn't America, Jack.

40
00:06:06,095 --> 00:06:08,975
This is L.A.

41
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:19,215
I thought we weren't
gonna do this anymore.

42
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,632
- Do what?
- This.

43
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:24,015
Come on, let's go.

44
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:40,656
Jack?

45
00:06:43,056 --> 00:06:44,061
Maybe he's dead.

46
00:06:44,096 --> 00:06:45,976
He's not dead,
he's looking right at us.

47
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:48,737
Jack, are you dead?

48
00:06:48,772 --> 00:06:50,062
He's alive.

49
00:06:50,097 --> 00:06:52,977
Now, Jack, we don't have
organized crime in L.A.,

50
00:06:54,137 --> 00:06:57,017
and frankly,
we don't want organized crime.

51
00:06:58,097 --> 00:07:00,017
So here's what I want you to do.

52
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,937
I want you to look around...

53
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:04,182
...and remember this...

54
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:07,097
because this will always be
your way back to Chicago.

55
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:12,418
Mulholland Falls.

56
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:35,264
Lee.

57
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:38,179
Now, that's a thought.

58
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:41,299
- Hey, Max.
- Kate.

59
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:43,184
- Lili.
- Hi.

60
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:46,099
We were just discussing husbands.

61
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:48,339
I'm trying to find a new one for Lili.

62
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:49,904
- Do you know any?
- Jeez, Lili.

63
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:51,940
Only guys I know
are cops and bad guys.

64
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:53,385
Thanks, Pete.

65
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,300
And I don't know
if I can recommend either one.

66
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,560
How about Eddie Hall?

67
00:07:59,595 --> 00:08:01,820
- Eddie Hall?
- Yeah.

68
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:03,865
Eddie Hall. No.

69
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,200
He's been married five times.

70
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,465
- You see what I mean?
- Yeah.

71
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,380
I'm sorry I was late, Kate, but we had
a little accident up in the hills.

72
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:18,546
No, no, no, Kate.

73
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,021
You know I got two flat feet.

74
00:08:21,056 --> 00:08:22,826
Come on.

75
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:25,741
Excuse us, Lili.

76
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:41,702
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

77
00:09:21,064 --> 00:09:22,869
- You the foreman?
- Yeah.

78
00:09:22,904 --> 00:09:25,084
Where are we out here?
What is this?

79
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:27,229
We're in a new housing subdivision.

80
00:09:27,264 --> 00:09:30,024
You ever think about who those people
are that are gonna live way out here?

81
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:31,029
No.

82
00:09:31,064 --> 00:09:32,829
Me, neither.

83
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,744
All right, guys,
I'll take it from here.

84
00:09:36,664 --> 00:09:39,544
- No pictures till I tell ya.
- Whatever you say.

85
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:47,190
Hey, Doc.

86
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:49,950
Max, I should've stayed in bed.

87
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:51,945
Are you in charge of this operation?

88
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,510
Yeah, this part I am.

89
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:55,430
You got any heavy equipment
around here

90
00:09:55,465 --> 00:09:58,345
that could press a woman
into the ground like that?

91
00:09:59,305 --> 00:10:01,030
A big roller maybe.

92
00:10:01,065 --> 00:10:03,191
Seems like that would've
chewed her up more.

93
00:10:03,226 --> 00:10:05,426
- Is this the way you found her?
- Yeah. We didn't touch it.

94
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:08,271
Yeah, she was just like this.

95
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:11,186
Why don't you step over there,
an officer will take your full statement.

96
00:10:16,306 --> 00:10:17,591
Jesus, Milt.

97
00:10:17,626 --> 00:10:20,431
There's nothing to hold on to.

98
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:23,346
Okay, roll her over
and see what she looks like.

99
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:37,307
Jesus.

100
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:44,707
- You okay, Max?
- Yeah.

101
00:10:48,988 --> 00:10:51,868
Step aside, boys.
Let me get a couple.

102
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:57,468
Jeez, what a mess.

103
00:10:59,268 --> 00:11:01,228
- Check under her fingernails.
- Okay.

104
00:11:01,263 --> 00:11:02,513
How'd she die?

105
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:05,428
It's like she jumped off a cliff.

106
00:11:06,468 --> 00:11:08,829
There's no cliff out there.

107
00:11:08,864 --> 00:11:10,466
Somebody moved her?

108
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:12,034
She wasn't moved.

109
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:14,949
She died just where you found her.

110
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:18,469
Doc, did you see this?

111
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:32,115
What is it?

112
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,030
Looks like glass.

113
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:20,912
"A Farewell to Arms."

114
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:23,352
"By Ernest Hemingway."

115
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:32,512
You know the way this guy writes,
he never talked to a woman in his life.

116
00:12:37,953 --> 00:12:40,833
When did you ever read Hemingway?

117
00:12:41,473 --> 00:12:44,353
He thinks they all
wanna be called "my darlin'."

118
00:12:48,193 --> 00:12:51,073
And what they really want is?

119
00:12:57,313 --> 00:13:00,194
What they really want is a man...

120
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:04,834
...that'll listen to their stomachs.

121
00:13:06,914 --> 00:13:09,719
Max, don't drool on me.

122
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:12,634
- Come on.
- What's the matter?

123
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:15,754
I'm sorry.

124
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:23,155
What's wrong?

125
00:13:24,115 --> 00:13:25,280
Tell me.

126
00:13:25,315 --> 00:13:28,195
We found a dead girl in the Valley.

127
00:13:31,235 --> 00:13:34,115
She was broken into 30 pieces.

128
00:13:36,235 --> 00:13:39,115
Couldn't even pick her up.

129
00:13:44,316 --> 00:13:46,896
Who is she?

130
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:49,476
Nobody.

131
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:54,876
Just a girl.

132
00:13:54,996 --> 00:13:57,876
Just a girl.

133
00:13:58,276 --> 00:14:01,156
I'm sorry, Kate.

134
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:10,437
Can you believe that?
The D.A. won't indict Kroyle.

135
00:14:10,472 --> 00:14:12,002
What's wrong with this country?

136
00:14:12,037 --> 00:14:14,917
A guy chops up his parents with an axe
and doesn't get the gas chamber?

137
00:14:14,957 --> 00:14:17,037
How can you plea bargain
something like that?

138
00:14:17,072 --> 00:14:19,117
His fingerprints are
all over the murder weapon.

139
00:14:19,152 --> 00:14:20,682
That places him
at the scene of the crime.

140
00:14:20,717 --> 00:14:23,237
They won't indict.
It doesn't make any difference.

141
00:14:23,272 --> 00:14:25,758
I knew that D.A. when he was
a bagman for Jack Draga.

142
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,238
No kiddin'. How'd he become
a D.A. then, for Christ' sake?

143
00:14:28,273 --> 00:14:29,723
D.A.'s an elected office.

144
00:14:29,758 --> 00:14:32,638
Any scumbag can get in
if they got enough votes.

145
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:36,398
Ellery, how come
you got a hot dog in your mouth

146
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:38,043
while you're threading a projector?

147
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:40,958
Why do you eat while you're working?
Why do you eat all the time?

148
00:14:42,438 --> 00:14:45,318
It's all psychological, Max.
I eat so I don't think about food.

149
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,679
So you eat
so you don't think about food?

150
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:50,724
Yeah.

151
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,839
Ellery, I don't wanna
butt into your business,

152
00:14:52,874 --> 00:14:54,919
but this psychiatrist,
the guy you're going to,

153
00:14:54,954 --> 00:14:57,039
I think he's in worse shape
than you are.

154
00:14:57,074 --> 00:14:59,919
She, Max.
It's a woman.

155
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,319
Dammit, I can't get
my finger in there! It won't fit!

156
00:15:03,354 --> 00:15:04,956
Try your dick.

157
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:07,215
Esther, please.

158
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,440
Here, try this.

159
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,840
So you're going to her about food?

160
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,285
Yeah.

161
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,200
I thought you were going to her
about the other thing.

162
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,660
- My temper?
- Yeah.

163
00:15:20,695 --> 00:15:22,245
It's all related, Max.

164
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,160
The eating and the anger,
they come from the same place.

165
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,720
The food calms me down.

166
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:39,081
Esther, don't you have
something better to do?

167
00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:41,961
No. Not better than this.

168
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:43,886
All right.

169
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:46,801
- Ready?
- Yeah. Turn it on.

170
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:55,882
What is this,
somebody's summer vacation?

171
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:03,802
That's the girl we found
in the Valley, Max.

172
00:16:50,484 --> 00:16:52,924
Max, I gotta talk to you about this D.A.

173
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,969
He's a prick. Max?

174
00:16:55,004 --> 00:16:57,684
I have a claim ticket.
I need to pick up some merchandise.

175
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,365
Ma'am, you have to take that
down to ground floor.

176
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,245
- Thank you.
- Property Division.

177
00:17:17,365 --> 00:17:20,246
Coolidge, do me a favor.

178
00:17:20,326 --> 00:17:22,326
You go get yourself something to eat.

179
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:24,691
Go back to your desk.

180
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:26,931
Max, if something is wrong...

181
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:29,846
I mean, maybe it's best to talk it out,
you know, and get it out in the open,

182
00:17:31,566 --> 00:17:33,006
if it's anything like that.

183
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,251
No, nothing like that.

184
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:36,531
But any problem could be solved, Max.

185
00:17:36,566 --> 00:17:39,446
All you have to do is break it down
into parts, you see?

186
00:17:39,486 --> 00:17:42,367
It's just simple, it's right into parts-
my psychiatrist told me-

187
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:44,587
and you deal
with each part individually.

188
00:17:44,622 --> 00:17:46,574
One part, and then you go
to the next part.

189
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:48,527
You just gotta break it down,
but the first-

190
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:50,652
Ellery.

191
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:53,567
Do me that favor.

192
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:56,487
Just do it.

193
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,890
Hoover!

194
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,570
You alone?

195
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:08,450
Yeah.

196
00:19:14,811 --> 00:19:16,851
- I need protection.
- From what?

197
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:18,888
You look at the film I sent you?

198
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:21,027
You know who the guy in it is?

199
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:23,131
I don't even knowwho you are.

200
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,336
I'm Jimmy Fields.

201
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,691
Look, that guy in the movie,
he killed her!

202
00:19:26,726 --> 00:19:28,536
Killed who?

203
00:19:28,571 --> 00:19:30,391
Spare me the crap,
I don't have time for it!

204
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:32,177
A mutual friend is dead,
they killed her,

205
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,092
and I'm going out the same way
unless I can get some help.

206
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:38,292
How do you know she's dead?

207
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:41,852
Because she would've
called me otherwise.

208
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:44,172
Because she always called me,
always, always.

209
00:19:44,532 --> 00:19:47,412
Because I was her best friend.

210
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:51,217
That means I didn't fuck her.

211
00:19:51,252 --> 00:19:54,133
What did you do with her,
share makeup tips?

212
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,213
Do I make you nervous, Lieutenant?

213
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:05,013
When was the last time you saw her?

214
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:07,233
Saturday.

215
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:09,218
In Vegas.

216
00:20:09,253 --> 00:20:11,253
She dropped my camera off
Saturday morning,

217
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:12,978
said she'd meet me back in L.A.,

218
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:15,814
that her and the general
were gonna go for a little ride.

219
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:17,894
What general?

220
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:19,859
Cops.

221
00:20:19,894 --> 00:20:21,774
Does Thomas Timms ring a bell?

222
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:24,654
You go look it up.

223
00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:30,934
How many more films are there?

224
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:33,099
Couple.

225
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:34,654
Did she know?

226
00:20:34,689 --> 00:20:35,779
Maybe.

227
00:20:35,814 --> 00:20:37,620
I asked you a question.

228
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:40,535
Did she know
you were taking movies?

229
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:44,980
No.

230
00:20:45,015 --> 00:20:47,895
I'd put that gun away.

231
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:51,535
Help me, Hoover.
You're supposed to be a cop!

232
00:20:53,175 --> 00:20:56,055
I thought you couldn't
turn anybody down.

233
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:04,096
Is that was she said?

234
00:21:05,216 --> 00:21:08,096
That's what she said.

235
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:11,616
She was wrong.

236
00:21:21,017 --> 00:21:23,657
I had him by the neck
when he swore at me.

237
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:25,022
Here he comes.

238
00:21:25,057 --> 00:21:26,822
Where are we going, Max?

239
00:21:26,857 --> 00:21:29,142
Better not show up
to the courtroom late!

240
00:21:29,177 --> 00:21:32,057
I got something to take care of.
I'll be back later.

241
00:21:32,697 --> 00:21:35,382
We gotta ask you a question.

242
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:38,297
The dead girl-she's the same one
that's in the movie, isn't she?

243
00:21:41,457 --> 00:21:43,298
Coolidge tell you that?

244
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,103
I've been worried, Max.

245
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:48,018
Worried? You're worried?
What the hell you worried about?

246
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:50,103
We're partners here.

247
00:21:50,138 --> 00:21:53,018
Tell us, was something going on
between you and that dead girl?

248
00:21:56,418 --> 00:21:59,298
Look, guys, I want you to cut me
a little slack on this one.

249
00:21:59,898 --> 00:22:02,778
Just let me do what I gotta do.

250
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:13,019
I thought you had
grand jury testimony today.

251
00:22:13,054 --> 00:22:14,979
To hell with the grand jury, Max.

252
00:22:15,014 --> 00:22:17,859
So where are we going?

253
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,060
You know, I've been thinking, why is it
we always sit in the same places?

254
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,820
And why is it you're always
the one that drives, Max?

255
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:34,905
I guess it's 'cause I got the keys.

256
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,820
Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.
Why is it you always have the keys?

257
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,500
There's reasons for everything, right?

258
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:43,100
Ellery, I would never attempt to criticize

259
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,940
the inner workings of the human mind.

260
00:22:47,781 --> 00:22:49,786
Are you still seeing that psychiatrist?

261
00:22:49,821 --> 00:22:51,901
There's nothing wrong
with my psychiatrist.

262
00:22:51,936 --> 00:22:54,421
We just wanna know how much longer.

263
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,141
I don't know, it's open-ended.

264
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:59,021
Oh, Jesus, God.

265
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:03,221
Why is it you have the keys, Max?

266
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:06,161
- Max.
- Yeah.

267
00:23:06,196 --> 00:23:08,581
Let Ellery drive.

268
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,542
Are you happy, Coolidge?

269
00:23:15,577 --> 00:23:18,027
Yup.

270
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:20,942
Take it out of low.

271
00:23:29,902 --> 00:23:31,383
Oh, jeez!

272
00:23:31,418 --> 00:23:32,828
Sorry, Max.

273
00:23:32,863 --> 00:23:35,743
That's why he usually has the keys.

274
00:23:40,663 --> 00:23:43,543
Relyea, go talk to the manager,
tell him we're going through a room.

275
00:23:43,743 --> 00:23:46,623
Right.

276
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:12,190
Manager says some guy in 23,
a Jimmy Fields, is her best friend.

277
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:15,590
Hasn't seen either one of them
in over a week.

278
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,431
He's not very neat, is he?

279
00:26:34,871 --> 00:26:37,751
Son of a bitch!

280
00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:48,232
Son of a bitch!

281
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:28,393
- You all right, Max?
- Yeah.

282
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:33,914
For a minute there,
I just couldn't breathe.

283
00:27:36,714 --> 00:27:39,594
I couldn't stay in there.

284
00:27:40,954 --> 00:27:43,834
- Want a cigarette?
- Yeah.

285
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:52,394
How long were you seeing her?

286
00:27:59,955 --> 00:28:02,835
Six months.

287
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:05,795
Every chance I got.

288
00:28:07,475 --> 00:28:10,355
Here?

289
00:28:10,715 --> 00:28:13,595
Yeah, here.

290
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:21,961
Jesus Christ.

291
00:28:21,996 --> 00:28:24,876
That guy's got film on you
and everything, doesn't he?

292
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:36,797
You remember Kenny Kamins?

293
00:28:37,037 --> 00:28:39,477
- Can I help you, gentlemen?
- We're looking for Kenny Kamins.

294
00:28:39,512 --> 00:28:41,477
- Have you seen him?
- Never heard of him.

295
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:43,654
He never heard of him.

296
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,797
You believe that, fellas?

297
00:28:46,877 --> 00:28:49,757
What are you guys doing here?
You got a fucking warrant?

298
00:28:49,877 --> 00:28:51,917
You sound like you're from New York.

299
00:28:51,952 --> 00:28:54,797
- So what?
- I'm from Jersey.

300
00:29:07,758 --> 00:29:10,338
What's going on?
What do you think you're doing, Kenny?

301
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,918
Relax, Allison.
Jenny and I were just having a party.

302
00:29:12,953 --> 00:29:15,318
Go do something useful.
Go powder your nose.

303
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,323
You're sick, Kenny.
This is sick!

304
00:29:17,358 --> 00:29:19,358
I'm not gonna let you do this to her.
She's a child.

305
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:20,844
So were you once, doll.

306
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:22,759
Look at what a woman you became.

307
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:25,176
No, Kenny.

308
00:29:25,211 --> 00:29:27,559
Are you nuts?

309
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:32,319
Nice one.
That was a good shot.

310
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:35,124
Come here.

311
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:38,039
You pull that shit again,
and I'm gonna break your little neck.

312
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:40,879
All right?

313
00:29:40,914 --> 00:29:43,280
Hello, Kenny.

314
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,480
This is a private party, Hoover.

315
00:29:46,515 --> 00:29:48,680
- You got a warrant?
- I got this.

316
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,800
Remember this, Kenny?

317
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,800
Kenny, Kenny,
what are you doing?

318
00:30:05,641 --> 00:30:08,081
- Get her out of here.
- Let's go.

319
00:30:08,116 --> 00:30:10,961
You broke my fingers!

320
00:30:11,241 --> 00:30:13,961
What do you say, Kenny,
we have a little party?

321
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:15,886
I don't do that stuff.

322
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:18,361
- You don't wanna see this.
- Yes, I do.

323
00:30:18,396 --> 00:30:20,801
Jesus Christ, Allison, call the cops!

324
00:30:20,836 --> 00:30:23,681
I am the cops, Kenny.

325
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:45,682
Inventive way of dispensing justice.

326
00:30:46,802 --> 00:30:49,683
It's an integral part of the job.

327
00:30:50,563 --> 00:30:53,443
You were more effective than I was.

328
00:31:28,884 --> 00:31:31,765
So, who are you?

329
00:31:35,285 --> 00:31:38,165
You won't find out by killing me.

330
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:52,485
Why did you fall for her, Max?

331
00:31:54,686 --> 00:31:57,566
What did Katherine say?
You told her, didn't you?

332
00:32:04,366 --> 00:32:07,166
- The guy with the camera, he's a fruit?
- Right.

333
00:32:07,201 --> 00:32:09,663
Not shaking you down, is he?

334
00:32:09,698 --> 00:32:11,812
Could be, he's running scared.

335
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,891
Maybe we should pay him a visit.

336
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:16,807
I thought we weren't gonna
do that anymore. We agreed.

337
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:21,447
Did you guys ever hear
of a general named Thomas Timms?

338
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:22,892
Yeah.

339
00:32:22,927 --> 00:32:25,292
He's one of the inventors
of the A-bomb.

340
00:32:25,327 --> 00:32:28,207
They made him Chairman
of the Atomic Energy Commission.

341
00:32:28,687 --> 00:32:31,567
I got seven minutes of film
with him with Allison.

342
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:41,853
You got trouble.

343
00:32:41,888 --> 00:32:44,768
Let's talk to the fruit.

344
00:32:44,888 --> 00:32:47,768
All right, let's go over it again.

345
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:50,933
What did she say?

346
00:32:50,968 --> 00:32:53,848
She said that she was going
for a ride with Timms.

347
00:32:55,368 --> 00:32:58,248
Out to where they test those things.

348
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:01,609
And she wasn't scared?

349
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:04,569
No, she wasn't scared.
She was never scared.

350
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:07,969
Except of being alone.

351
00:33:08,004 --> 00:33:10,169
Come on, Jimmy, sit down.

352
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:18,649
What'd you make the films for, Jimmy?

353
00:33:18,684 --> 00:33:21,290
What'd you make the films for?

354
00:33:21,325 --> 00:33:23,727
Why were you in it?

355
00:33:23,762 --> 00:33:26,130
What was it? Blackmail?

356
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:29,530
I thought about that.

357
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,490
You know, for a rainy-

358
00:33:31,525 --> 00:33:32,975
Why'd you make 'em?

359
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,290
- That was nice.
- What's wrong with Max?

360
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:37,570
- I don't know.
- What's the matter with him?

361
00:33:37,605 --> 00:33:40,450
Why'd you make 'em, Jimmy?

362
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,451
Because it made me feel a part of it.

363
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:49,531
You know, watch the boys
get impassioned.

364
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:54,171
You made films of me, didn't you?

365
00:33:54,611 --> 00:33:57,491
Yes, I did.

366
00:33:57,651 --> 00:34:00,136
Where are those films?

367
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:03,051
That's the question, isn't it?

368
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,372
When she didn't show up,
I went back to my apartment,

369
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:06,932
but the place was torn apart.

370
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:08,177
They'd taken them all.

371
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,532
Except for the one I sent you.

372
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:12,852
That was still at the lab.

373
00:34:15,372 --> 00:34:18,252
You know, Jimmy,
none of that proves Timms' guilt.

374
00:34:19,372 --> 00:34:20,937
What, do you need a roadmap?

375
00:34:20,972 --> 00:34:23,852
Timms knew about the film.
He's the last to see her alive.

376
00:34:23,932 --> 00:34:26,298
She's dead-
they killed her up there.

377
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,773
She didn't die in the desert,
she died here.

378
00:34:28,808 --> 00:34:31,338
Right outside of L.A.

379
00:34:31,373 --> 00:34:34,253
You told me yourself that Allison
didn't know about the films,

380
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:37,653
so Timms couldn't have
known about it either.

381
00:34:38,173 --> 00:34:40,138
Why would a guy kill his girl

382
00:34:40,173 --> 00:34:43,053
over a film he didn't even know existed?

383
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:46,753
You were the last to see her alive.

384
00:34:46,788 --> 00:34:49,374
How do I know you didn't kill her?

385
00:34:52,094 --> 00:34:54,974
Because I loved her
and she was my best friend.

386
00:34:57,854 --> 00:35:00,734
She nearly died when you left,
did you know that?

387
00:35:00,894 --> 00:35:03,534
She loved you,
and you just used her.

388
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,019
How does that feel?

389
00:35:05,054 --> 00:35:07,934
You know, you sit there
like you're protecting the innocent.

390
00:35:09,614 --> 00:35:11,300
All you really do
is just beat up on the weak

391
00:35:11,335 --> 00:35:14,215
and disregard or destroy anybody
or anything that stands in the way

392
00:35:15,095 --> 00:35:17,975
of you and your pathetic little sense
of right or wrong or justice and power.

393
00:35:19,415 --> 00:35:22,295
If anybody is responsible
for Allison's death...

394
00:35:25,575 --> 00:35:26,580
...it's you.

395
00:35:26,615 --> 00:35:28,655
You son of a bitch!

396
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,660
Shit! Come on, Eddie.

397
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,576
Come on, he's gonna kill me!

398
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:37,821
Come on!

399
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,296
- Get him out of here!
- It ain't worth it.

400
00:35:40,331 --> 00:35:42,736
You don't realize-
Just get him out of here!

401
00:35:43,696 --> 00:35:46,576
Come on, Fields, let's go.
Move it.

402
00:35:55,057 --> 00:35:56,862
Max, everybody has weak moments.

403
00:35:56,897 --> 00:35:58,897
You gotta get it out,
you gotta tell Kathy.

404
00:35:58,932 --> 00:35:59,982
Shut up!

405
00:36:00,017 --> 00:36:01,582
Shut the hell up!

406
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,337
Jesus Christ, is that what
your psychiatrist told you?

407
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:06,782
Let me tell you how it goes, Ellery.

408
00:36:06,817 --> 00:36:09,697
You meet somebody-
Maybe they're a little off center,

409
00:36:10,097 --> 00:36:11,717
but they tell you the truth.

410
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,302
And you like them for that,

411
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,938
and one thing leads to another,
and you end up in bed.

412
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,623
- Now, that's weak.
- Max-

413
00:36:17,658 --> 00:36:20,383
But, now, listen to me.
Nobody gets hurt.

414
00:36:20,418 --> 00:36:23,298
You go home, and you see your wife,
and you're feeling bad.

415
00:36:25,538 --> 00:36:28,418
You wanna unload it,
you wanna get it off your chest.

416
00:36:28,578 --> 00:36:31,458
So you tell her, and now she's hurt.

417
00:36:32,418 --> 00:36:34,738
Now, that's weak, too, Ellery.

418
00:36:34,773 --> 00:36:37,215
But it's also cruel.

419
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:39,659
It's just goddamn cruel.

420
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:42,864
Here's something for you.

421
00:36:42,899 --> 00:36:45,779
Here's something that doesn't
cost you 25 bucks an hour.

422
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:50,459
You carry your own water, Ellery.

423
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:53,424
You understand?

424
00:36:53,459 --> 00:36:56,339
Carry your own water.

425
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,740
Max, I was just trying to help.
I'm sorry.

426
00:37:04,775 --> 00:37:07,157
No, forget it.

427
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:09,540
It's all right.

428
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,981
We're still partners, right?

429
00:37:23,016 --> 00:37:24,938
Yeah. Partners.

430
00:37:24,973 --> 00:37:26,826
Thanks, Ell.

431
00:37:26,861 --> 00:37:29,741
Go help them, will you?

432
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:36,101
- You okay, Max?
- Yeah.

433
00:38:21,063 --> 00:38:23,943
Come here.

434
00:38:44,184 --> 00:38:47,064
I don't understand how
anybody can live at the beach.

435
00:38:47,464 --> 00:38:50,345
Those waves crashing
and flopping all the time...

436
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:54,390
...drive me crazy.

437
00:38:54,425 --> 00:38:57,025
I'm with you, Eddie. I like the sound
of traffic when I'm sleeping.

438
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,905
I find it very peaceful.

439
00:39:00,065 --> 00:39:01,910
Most people do.

440
00:39:01,945 --> 00:39:04,825
I guess cops are just different.

441
00:39:05,305 --> 00:39:07,350
Don't push your luck there, Fields.

442
00:39:07,385 --> 00:39:09,945
The only reason we're here
is because of Max.

443
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,751
If I had it my way,

444
00:39:11,786 --> 00:39:14,186
I'd rather dump you out
of a speeding car.

445
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:17,066
See if you'd bounce around a little.

446
00:39:17,386 --> 00:39:18,551
Hey, Earl!

447
00:39:18,586 --> 00:39:20,106
How's that chili comin'?

448
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:21,831
It's done.

449
00:39:21,866 --> 00:39:24,746
As my Aunt Mabel used to say,
presentation is everything.

450
00:39:25,346 --> 00:39:28,226
I think you and Coolidge
ought to open up an automat.

451
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:31,146
The look is connected
to the way it tastes.

452
00:39:36,747 --> 00:39:39,627
Stay down!

453
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:53,267
It stopped.

454
00:39:53,467 --> 00:39:56,348
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

455
00:40:04,188 --> 00:40:06,633
Where's Fields?

456
00:40:06,668 --> 00:40:09,548
- I'll get him back.
- Right.

457
00:40:13,508 --> 00:40:16,389
Fields!

458
00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:21,869
Shit!

459
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,790
That's it.

460
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess so.

461
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:01,831
You see 'em take Fields?

462
00:41:01,866 --> 00:41:04,071
I couldn't see shit, Max.

463
00:41:04,231 --> 00:41:06,791
They shot the hell out of this place.

464
00:41:06,826 --> 00:41:09,671
Must've had a heavy machine gun.

465
00:41:09,911 --> 00:41:12,791
Fruitcake disappeared.

466
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:19,031
Lieutenant?
They want you down at the beach.

467
00:41:51,793 --> 00:41:54,318
We see around the head there...

468
00:41:54,353 --> 00:41:56,558
- Jesus Christ.
- How'd they kill him, Doc?

469
00:41:56,593 --> 00:41:58,353
What can I tell you?
They stuck a gun in his mouth

470
00:41:58,388 --> 00:41:59,473
and blew the back of his head off.

471
00:41:59,508 --> 00:42:00,438
An execution?

472
00:42:00,473 --> 00:42:02,413
Not until they asked him
some questions first.

473
00:42:02,448 --> 00:42:04,353
Contusions, abrasions,
ecchymosis around the neck.

474
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:05,639
Right.

475
00:42:05,674 --> 00:42:08,274
Come on, I wanna
show you guys something.

476
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:10,754
We took these x-rays of Allison Pond.

477
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:13,634
Look what happened.

478
00:42:14,234 --> 00:42:17,114
Yeah, this foot's got a heel.

479
00:42:17,194 --> 00:42:19,274
This one doesn't.
Why is it all blurry?

480
00:42:19,309 --> 00:42:21,599
Gamma rays fog the film.

481
00:42:21,634 --> 00:42:24,514
That glass in her foot, it's radioactive.

482
00:42:59,596 --> 00:43:01,441
Yes, sir?

483
00:43:01,476 --> 00:43:04,356
LAPD.
I'm here to see General Timms.

484
00:43:06,716 --> 00:43:09,596
Hey, give me that.

485
00:43:13,277 --> 00:43:14,842
Five to one we don't get in.

486
00:43:14,877 --> 00:43:17,197
This is the Army.
I say we try the back way.

487
00:43:17,232 --> 00:43:18,774
Five to one-I take those odds.

488
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:20,317
- You'll take it?
- Yeah.

489
00:43:20,352 --> 00:43:21,322
Five to one?

490
00:43:21,357 --> 00:43:24,237
- Here's my five.
- Here, you hold the money.

491
00:43:25,197 --> 00:43:28,077
Make sure he knows that.

492
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:32,798
Sorry, sir.
No civilian admittance, no exceptions.

493
00:43:34,198 --> 00:43:37,078
- Did you talk to General Timms?
- The General's unavailable, sir.

494
00:43:37,638 --> 00:43:39,763
Did you tell him it was police business?

495
00:43:39,798 --> 00:43:42,678
Yes, sir. They said no
civilian admittance, no exceptions.

496
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:48,123
You lose, Coolidge.

497
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:51,038
You know, you could've
talked to him a little more, Max.

498
00:43:51,198 --> 00:43:54,078
You owe me a buck.

499
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,380
Wait, wait, wait.

500
00:44:36,415 --> 00:44:38,046
Amateur hour.

501
00:44:38,081 --> 00:44:40,961
Seen too many movies, Relyea.

502
00:44:59,081 --> 00:45:00,727
Shit.

503
00:45:00,762 --> 00:45:03,642
- Come on, it's hot.
- I'll get it, I'll get it.

504
00:45:05,082 --> 00:45:07,562
Let me try.

505
00:45:07,597 --> 00:45:10,042
All right.

506
00:45:18,602 --> 00:45:21,483
You know, when I was a kid, I thought
everybody in Hollywood had a horse.

507
00:45:23,323 --> 00:45:26,203
Because every movie I saw
was a cowboy movie.

508
00:45:26,363 --> 00:45:28,363
You remember those movies, right?

509
00:45:28,398 --> 00:45:30,328
They would come galloping into town,

510
00:45:30,363 --> 00:45:33,243
the cowboys would get off the horse,
dust all over the place.

511
00:45:34,243 --> 00:45:36,383
They get the reins
and wrap it around the railing

512
00:45:36,418 --> 00:45:38,530
once, twice, three times,
keep on wrapping it,

513
00:45:38,565 --> 00:45:40,608
but Gene Autry?
Let me tell you something.

514
00:45:40,643 --> 00:45:43,504
Gene Autry would come into town,
jump off the horse,

515
00:45:43,539 --> 00:45:46,364
and carefully wrap the reins
around once, just once.

516
00:45:47,484 --> 00:45:50,364
Then he would go inside
and see the sheriff.

517
00:45:52,444 --> 00:45:55,324
Boy, did I worry
about that horse getting away.

518
00:45:56,284 --> 00:45:59,164
I did.

519
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:17,885
What the hell is that?

520
00:46:20,645 --> 00:46:23,525
This place is weird.

521
00:47:10,287 --> 00:47:13,168
Jesus, what a big hole.

522
00:47:14,528 --> 00:47:17,013
We just dropped
the damn thing right here?

523
00:47:17,048 --> 00:47:19,928
Yup. That's what happens
when they set one off at ground level.

524
00:47:21,888 --> 00:47:24,373
What happened to all the dirt?

525
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:27,288
Vaporized, along with everything else.

526
00:47:28,528 --> 00:47:31,408
We got company.

527
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:36,649
- Guess it's time to go, huh?
- Yeah.

528
00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:53,729
Step on it.

529
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,970
Put your hands in the air
or you will be shot!

530
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:36,291
They're clean, sir.

531
00:48:53,532 --> 00:48:56,412
You men are in violation of federal law.

532
00:48:57,172 --> 00:48:59,577
I could have you all shot.

533
00:48:59,612 --> 00:49:02,493
Do you have some identification?

534
00:49:03,973 --> 00:49:06,853
There you go.

535
00:49:10,053 --> 00:49:12,933
Put your hands down, gentlemen.

536
00:49:14,333 --> 00:49:16,578
"Lieutenant Hoover."

537
00:49:16,613 --> 00:49:19,098
Los Angeles Police Department.

538
00:49:19,133 --> 00:49:21,698
We're investigating a homicide, sir.

539
00:49:21,733 --> 00:49:24,614
You're way out
of your jurisdiction, Lieutenant.

540
00:49:25,774 --> 00:49:28,454
I'm going to assume
that you are aware of the penalties

541
00:49:28,489 --> 00:49:31,334
for trespassing
a federally restricted area.

542
00:49:31,574 --> 00:49:34,294
And for destruction
of government property.

543
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:35,779
We go where the case takes us.

544
00:49:35,814 --> 00:49:38,694
Not if it takes you here you don't.

545
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:41,219
Out here it's military law.

546
00:49:41,254 --> 00:49:44,135
And I'm in charge of enforcing it.

547
00:49:44,735 --> 00:49:46,460
Captain?

548
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:49,015
Escort these gentlemen back
to the base and lock them up.

549
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:51,895
- Yes, sir.
- Colonel, sir?

550
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:57,620
Yes, sir.

551
00:49:57,655 --> 00:50:00,535
On the perimeter, sir,
but they'd violated security-

552
00:50:01,735 --> 00:50:03,660
I don't think that's a good idea, sir.

553
00:50:03,695 --> 00:50:06,576
Well, I don't think that's a good idea, sir.

554
00:50:08,096 --> 00:50:13,776
Yes, sir.

555
00:50:16,496 --> 00:50:17,861
Put that one in the jeep.

556
00:50:17,896 --> 00:50:19,416
The rest of them can wait at the base.

557
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:21,216
- Sergeant!
- Miller, Resnick!

558
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:22,821
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

559
00:50:22,856 --> 00:50:25,376
If I see this vehicle
in a restricted area again,

560
00:50:25,411 --> 00:50:28,257
I'll burn it... and everyone in it.

561
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:56,898
Lieutenant.

562
00:51:05,498 --> 00:51:08,378
Wait here.

563
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:31,499
Hoover, Truman...

564
00:51:31,699 --> 00:51:34,580
Is that the general?

565
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,180
All bombs.

566
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:43,140
- What are those?
- Ships.

567
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,585
Lieutenant Hoover,
I'm General Timms.

568
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,500
What can I do for the Los Angeles
Police Department today?

569
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,665
I came to talk about Allison Pond.

570
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,580
Yes, I know.
Colonel Fitzgerald informed me.

571
00:51:55,061 --> 00:51:57,941
Did he also mention the condition
in which Miss Pond was found?

572
00:51:59,061 --> 00:52:01,546
Yes, he did.

573
00:52:01,581 --> 00:52:04,461
Excuse me for not wanting to stand,
but I've had a horse accident.

574
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:08,946
I pinched a sciatic nerve.

575
00:52:08,981 --> 00:52:11,541
Have you ever had
back troubles, Lieutenant?

576
00:52:11,576 --> 00:52:14,421
I got shot there once.

577
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,467
I'm going to cut
through formalities, Lieutenant.

578
00:52:27,502 --> 00:52:30,382
You are aware that Miss Pond and I
had a certain relationship,

579
00:52:31,662 --> 00:52:34,542
and I believe you're also aware that she
had similar relationships with other men.

580
00:52:38,383 --> 00:52:40,463
I believe Miss Pond
was in your company

581
00:52:40,498 --> 00:52:42,548
from Friday through the weekend.

582
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:45,463
That sounds about right.
We went to Tahoe on Saturday.

583
00:52:46,623 --> 00:52:48,068
Senator Bolton has a house there

584
00:52:48,103 --> 00:52:50,983
that he lends us for the weekend
from time to time.

585
00:52:51,663 --> 00:52:53,988
So you were in Tahoe, not here?

586
00:52:54,023 --> 00:52:56,623
Friday night here,
then Tahoe on Saturday,

587
00:52:56,658 --> 00:52:59,223
and Sunday night, I flew to Washington.

588
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:01,944
She wasn't out at the test site?

589
00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:04,589
That's restricted.

590
00:53:04,624 --> 00:53:07,504
But then you know that, don't you?

591
00:53:08,544 --> 00:53:11,424
She went down to Los Angeles
Saturday, Lieutenant,

592
00:53:11,584 --> 00:53:14,464
and I went on for a meeting
with the Secretary of Defense.

593
00:53:18,984 --> 00:53:21,864
Do you think much about
national security, Lieutenant?

594
00:53:21,984 --> 00:53:24,865
Well, I got all the security I can handle
right now in L.A., General.

595
00:53:27,465 --> 00:53:30,345
Do you know much about
atomic energy, what it means?

596
00:53:30,745 --> 00:53:33,625
Ended the war.

597
00:53:33,905 --> 00:53:36,785
Did you know that the atom itself
is mostly empty space?

598
00:53:37,305 --> 00:53:39,270
I never really thought about it, General.

599
00:53:39,305 --> 00:53:42,185
Almost completely empty,
but with tiny fragments of matter.

600
00:53:42,945 --> 00:53:45,631
And since this entire universe
is made up of atoms,

601
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:48,546
everything that we see and touch-
in fact, the very floor beneath us-

602
00:53:49,906 --> 00:53:52,586
is made up of almost
completely empty space.

603
00:53:52,621 --> 00:53:54,831
The only reason we don't fall through it

604
00:53:54,866 --> 00:53:57,746
is because these tiny particles
of matter are just whirling about

605
00:53:58,586 --> 00:54:01,466
at such speed that they give us
the illusion of solidity.

606
00:54:02,386 --> 00:54:05,266
Actually, the floor is spinning
right underneath our feet.

607
00:54:06,627 --> 00:54:09,507
Do you feel it, Lieutenant?

608
00:54:10,027 --> 00:54:12,907
Then we're just empty space ourselves.

609
00:54:12,987 --> 00:54:14,112
Exactly, exactly.

610
00:54:14,147 --> 00:54:17,027
And these-
these tiny particles of matter,

611
00:54:17,267 --> 00:54:20,147
which are so small that
no one's ever seen them-never-

612
00:54:21,427 --> 00:54:24,307
they contain enough energy
to blow up this house,

613
00:54:25,787 --> 00:54:28,668
an entire city, every person on Earth.

614
00:54:29,948 --> 00:54:32,828
That is inconceivable.

615
00:54:32,908 --> 00:54:35,788
General, I really don't think
much about those things.

616
00:54:36,188 --> 00:54:38,548
I'd probably see too much.

617
00:54:38,583 --> 00:54:41,428
What do you see?

618
00:54:43,628 --> 00:54:46,393
People dead before their time.

619
00:54:46,428 --> 00:54:49,308
That's the history
of the world, Lieutenant.

620
00:54:49,469 --> 00:54:51,989
Some people die before their time
so that others can live.

621
00:54:52,024 --> 00:54:54,069
It's the cornerstone of civilization.

622
00:54:54,104 --> 00:54:56,474
War, religion, democracy.

623
00:54:56,509 --> 00:54:59,189
A hundred die
so that a thousand may live.

624
00:54:59,224 --> 00:55:01,869
Well, General, I take 'em one at a time.

625
00:55:01,904 --> 00:55:04,749
Right now I got Allison Pond.

626
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:14,870
We're not so different,
you and I, Lieutenant.

627
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:19,430
You see, certain men-
a doctor, a national leader,

628
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:24,070
an officer of the law-give to society
in ways that most people do not.

629
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:28,510
In turn, society gives them
certain considerations.

630
00:55:28,545 --> 00:55:30,830
Now, we don't teach this in school.

631
00:55:30,865 --> 00:55:32,955
We don't acknowledge it.

632
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:35,771
But those who accept
the burden of leadership

633
00:55:35,806 --> 00:55:38,551
understand they have
these considerations.

634
00:55:38,871 --> 00:55:41,711
You've accepted the burden
of leadership, haven't you, Lieutenant?

635
00:55:41,746 --> 00:55:44,436
In what sense, General?

636
00:55:44,471 --> 00:55:47,351
You protect society, the ordinary citizen.

637
00:55:47,631 --> 00:55:50,511
Now, in doing so,
sometimes you may break the law.

638
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:54,431
You may violate the Constitution,
the Bill of Rights, Search and Seizure.

639
00:55:56,512 --> 00:55:59,392
In fact, it-it may even
be known that you do so.

640
00:55:59,872 --> 00:56:01,757
And yet, nothing happens,

641
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:04,672
because it is understood that
that is part of the burden of leadership.

642
00:56:05,432 --> 00:56:07,772
And you accept it.

643
00:56:07,807 --> 00:56:10,112
You accept your sins.

644
00:56:12,632 --> 00:56:15,512
General, Allison Pond
was out at your test site.

645
00:56:17,593 --> 00:56:20,473
We found this in her foot.

646
00:56:24,553 --> 00:56:26,753
I'm gonna need your calendar
for the last month-

647
00:56:26,788 --> 00:56:28,953
where you were, who you saw.

648
00:56:28,988 --> 00:56:30,638
Of course you are.

649
00:56:30,673 --> 00:56:33,553
Colonel Fitzgerald will get you
everything you need.

650
00:56:34,473 --> 00:56:37,353
Thank you, sir.

651
00:56:37,433 --> 00:56:40,314
Nice house.

652
00:56:48,474 --> 00:56:50,479
I've spoken to Los Angeles.

653
00:56:50,514 --> 00:56:53,394
We'll have the film within 24 hours.

654
00:56:58,234 --> 00:57:01,115
What'd Timms have to say?

655
00:57:02,275 --> 00:57:05,155
He said the cornerstone
of civilization was human sacrifice.

656
00:57:24,396 --> 00:57:25,836
Lieutenant Hoover, sir.

657
00:57:25,871 --> 00:57:27,961
Maxwell.

658
00:57:27,996 --> 00:57:30,876
Maxwell Hoover, say hello
to Special Agent Jeffrey McCafferty

659
00:57:32,996 --> 00:57:35,876
of the old FBl.

660
00:57:36,316 --> 00:57:37,841
Lieutenant.

661
00:57:37,876 --> 00:57:40,756
Special Agent McCafferty here seems
to be interested in one of our cases.

662
00:57:43,956 --> 00:57:46,042
Allison Pond.

663
00:57:46,077 --> 00:57:48,957
Special Agent, that was her name,
wasn't it? Allison Pond?

664
00:57:49,597 --> 00:57:50,842
Yes, sir.

665
00:57:50,877 --> 00:57:53,757
Bill, you mind if I inquire
what business it is of the FBl's?

666
00:57:55,517 --> 00:57:58,362
If I may, Chief.

667
00:57:58,397 --> 00:58:00,997
Our role here is purely informational.

668
00:58:01,032 --> 00:58:02,082
We are aware of the fact

669
00:58:02,117 --> 00:58:04,797
that a man of fundamental importance
to national security

670
00:58:04,832 --> 00:58:07,478
has somehow been brought
into an investigation

671
00:58:07,513 --> 00:58:10,358
in reference to a young girl's death.

672
00:58:10,558 --> 00:58:13,438
In light of the damage that this could do
to him both personally and in his work,

673
00:58:14,838 --> 00:58:17,443
the director felt that it was appropriate-

674
00:58:17,478 --> 00:58:20,358
without stepping
on your jurisdiction, of course-

675
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:23,878
for me to come down and share
with you our knowledge of the situation.

676
00:58:24,478 --> 00:58:27,358
And what would that be?

677
00:58:28,399 --> 00:58:31,279
I'm prepared to give you
the director's personal guarantee

678
00:58:31,479 --> 00:58:34,359
that General Timms had nothing
to do with the death of Allison Pond.

679
00:58:37,879 --> 00:58:40,759
How would the director know
something like that?

680
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:44,399
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to discuss that.

681
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:50,365
That's it?

682
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,125
If I call your boss in Washington,

683
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,040
he'll vouch for this pile of crap
you're handing us?

684
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,565
The director specifically
asked me to tell you

685
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,480
that he appreciates your cooperation
in this matter, Lieutenant Hoover.

686
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,080
He also felt that you would understand
the sensitive nature of the situation,

687
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,120
being that you're
a married man yourself.

688
00:59:13,281 --> 00:59:16,126
We are not
within our resources, gentlemen.

689
00:59:16,161 --> 00:59:18,846
And we're more than willing
to share them with you.

690
00:59:18,881 --> 00:59:21,761
Of course, if you were to come across
anything in regard to evidence,

691
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:25,481
the director would be grateful
to see it himself.

692
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:34,082
The director would be very grateful.

693
00:59:39,962 --> 00:59:42,527
Maxwell...

694
00:59:42,562 --> 00:59:45,442
Do you have the slightest idea
how intensely I hate

695
00:59:47,882 --> 00:59:50,762
these pathetic little Ivy League cops
being in my town?

696
00:59:52,162 --> 00:59:55,042
Let alone sitting in a chair
in my office?

697
00:59:56,163 --> 00:59:59,043
Yes, sir, I sure do.
Yes, sir.

698
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:03,243
Have you got anything hard
on this guy Timms?

699
01:00:03,563 --> 01:00:06,443
He's lying about Allison Pond.

700
01:00:06,883 --> 01:00:09,763
- Can you prove that?
- No, sir, I can't prove it, but I will.

701
01:00:10,243 --> 01:00:12,928
But here's the deal, Bill.
We had an informant.

702
01:00:12,963 --> 01:00:15,843
Now, he was killed at the beach
by a heavy machine gun-

703
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:17,369
heavy caliber machine gun.

704
01:00:17,404 --> 01:00:19,169
That's military, that's a connection.

705
01:00:19,204 --> 01:00:22,084
Wait a second, I know three guys
a block from Lankershim Boulevard

706
01:00:22,604 --> 01:00:25,484
in North Hollywood alone who've got
the same ordnance in their back rooms.

707
01:00:28,644 --> 01:00:29,689
Wake up.

708
01:00:29,724 --> 01:00:32,604
Bill, when we set this squad up,
we answered to nobody but you.

709
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:36,884
That was the deal-nobody but you.

710
01:00:36,919 --> 01:00:39,205
Four men, no politics, no favors.

711
01:00:39,365 --> 01:00:42,125
- We answered to nobody.
- No.

712
01:01:37,007 --> 01:01:39,887
A warrant?

713
01:01:41,287 --> 01:01:43,407
You're looking for a film?

714
01:01:43,442 --> 01:01:44,533
What kind of film?

715
01:01:44,568 --> 01:01:46,128
Mike, check the bookcase, please.

716
01:01:46,163 --> 01:01:49,008
What kind of film?

717
01:02:05,768 --> 01:02:08,489
Esther, where's Max?

718
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:10,246
Cut it.

719
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:11,934
No!

720
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:14,849
Find him!

721
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,050
- Are you hurt?
- No.

722
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:45,375
What happened?

723
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:48,290
The FBl was here with
a search warrant, looking for a film.

724
01:03:11,011 --> 01:03:13,892
What's going on?

725
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:19,572
Max, what is going on?

726
01:03:23,292 --> 01:03:26,172
The man in the film
is named Thomas Timms.

727
01:03:27,372 --> 01:03:30,252
He's the head
of the Atomic Energy Commission.

728
01:03:31,292 --> 01:03:33,738
And the girl is dead.

729
01:03:33,773 --> 01:03:36,653
- That's all?
- That's all.

730
01:03:40,693 --> 01:03:43,098
You know why these guys
are still L.A. cops?

731
01:03:43,133 --> 01:03:45,773
Because they couldn't cut the grade
to make federal agents.

732
01:03:45,808 --> 01:03:48,458
Wire taps, warrants, subpoenas-

733
01:03:48,493 --> 01:03:50,733
You follow proper procedure,
and it can't fail, boys.

734
01:03:50,768 --> 01:03:52,338
J. Edgar taught me that.

735
01:03:52,373 --> 01:03:55,033
This prick from the LAPD
thinks he got over on me?

736
01:03:55,068 --> 01:03:57,694
I fixed his ass with a search
warrant on his premises.

737
01:03:58,614 --> 01:04:00,379
What if Hoover comes here?

738
01:04:00,414 --> 01:04:03,294
I'll arrest him for trespassing.

739
01:04:03,894 --> 01:04:06,774
Jesus Christ!

740
01:04:49,576 --> 01:04:52,416
See? That's federal property.

741
01:04:52,451 --> 01:04:55,256
This isn't.
This is L.A.

742
01:04:55,576 --> 01:04:57,701
This is my town.

743
01:04:57,736 --> 01:04:59,541
Out here you're a trespasser.

744
01:04:59,576 --> 01:05:02,457
Out here I could pick you up,
burn your house,

745
01:05:02,897 --> 01:05:04,982
fuck your wife, and kill your dog.

746
01:05:05,017 --> 01:05:07,897
And the only thing that'll
protect you is if I can't find you...

747
01:05:09,897 --> 01:05:12,777
...and I already found you.

748
01:07:18,023 --> 01:07:20,903
How long?

749
01:07:28,823 --> 01:07:31,703
Six months.

750
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:36,264
A little less.

751
01:07:47,864 --> 01:07:50,704
Did everybody know?

752
01:07:52,384 --> 01:07:53,429
No.

753
01:07:53,464 --> 01:07:56,345
No, nobody knew.

754
01:08:13,225 --> 01:08:16,105
It's been over-

755
01:08:19,466 --> 01:08:22,346
You pig!

756
01:08:57,987 --> 01:09:00,867
Hoover.

757
01:09:03,708 --> 01:09:05,913
Fitzgerald.

758
01:09:05,948 --> 01:09:08,828
You've got something of ours.

759
01:09:12,508 --> 01:09:14,153
I wanna see Timms.

760
01:09:14,188 --> 01:09:16,828
There's no reason
to involve the General in this.

761
01:09:16,863 --> 01:09:19,708
It's a straight trade-yours for ours.

762
01:09:20,308 --> 01:09:23,068
What you got today was a copy.

763
01:09:23,103 --> 01:09:25,829
We will do whatever is necessary.

764
01:09:25,864 --> 01:09:28,709
No Timms, no deal.

765
01:09:30,269 --> 01:09:33,149
All right. 10:00 tomorrow
at the military airfield west of the city.

766
01:09:35,069 --> 01:09:37,949
You bring everything,
we bring everything-

767
01:09:38,269 --> 01:09:41,109
originals and any copies.

768
01:11:16,714 --> 01:11:19,594
This is where you bring people
to get rid of them.

769
01:11:22,274 --> 01:11:25,114
isn't it?

770
01:11:33,954 --> 01:11:36,835
It's over, right?

771
01:11:40,275 --> 01:11:42,115
It's not like that, Allison.

772
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:44,955
It's not just over.

773
01:11:47,875 --> 01:11:50,755
The thing is you think
you can have it both ways,

774
01:11:51,355 --> 01:11:54,235
that you can make it work both ways.

775
01:11:55,715 --> 01:11:58,556
But I can't.

776
01:12:01,076 --> 01:12:03,956
I have different problems, Max.

777
01:12:08,036 --> 01:12:10,876
I never wanted it both ways.

778
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,680
I thought you were asleep.

779
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:41,320
What are you thinking about?

780
01:13:55,881 --> 01:13:58,761
I know what you think.

781
01:13:59,641 --> 01:14:02,521
I just don't know
how you're thinking about it.

782
01:14:08,322 --> 01:14:11,202
It isn't good.

783
01:14:13,362 --> 01:14:16,242
Yeah.

784
01:14:26,162 --> 01:14:29,043
You want me to leave for a while?

785
01:14:33,883 --> 01:14:36,763
At least.

786
01:15:24,925 --> 01:15:26,885
- We got a serious problem, Max.
- What's that?

787
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,050
Hoover.
Not you, the other Hoover.

788
01:15:29,085 --> 01:15:31,605
Called the chief from Washington
5:00 this morning.

789
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:33,845
The chief has been
looking for you ever since.

790
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:36,651
Kidnapping, assault, attempted murder.

791
01:15:36,686 --> 01:15:39,566
If I attempted to murder
McCafferty, he'd be dead.

792
01:15:39,886 --> 01:15:42,286
Max, this is serious.
The chief is pissed!

793
01:15:42,321 --> 01:15:44,491
So let him be pissed.

794
01:15:44,526 --> 01:15:47,366
Max, he wants to talk to you.

795
01:15:49,286 --> 01:15:51,291
- What the hell are you doing?
- Coming along.

796
01:15:51,326 --> 01:15:53,806
I am not going back there
telling the chief you wouldn't come.

797
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:56,103
Hall's right about that psychiatrist.

798
01:15:56,138 --> 01:15:58,367
He's turning you into a piano teacher.

799
01:15:58,402 --> 01:16:00,524
She. It's a woman, Max.

800
01:16:00,559 --> 01:16:03,043
Where are we going, Max?

801
01:16:03,078 --> 01:16:05,527
Max? Where are we going?

802
01:16:31,408 --> 01:16:34,248
This is about to turn bad, isn't it, Max?

803
01:16:34,848 --> 01:16:37,728
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

804
01:16:39,408 --> 01:16:42,289
Now, listen, Coolidge,
you don't come with me.

805
01:16:42,324 --> 01:16:43,926
This is personal.

806
01:16:43,961 --> 01:16:45,494
Max, I'm coming.

807
01:16:45,529 --> 01:16:47,294
No, no, listen to me.

808
01:16:47,329 --> 01:16:49,829
This is something I gotta do.

809
01:16:49,864 --> 01:16:52,329
Max, we're partners.
I'm coming.

810
01:16:56,049 --> 01:16:58,929
Right. Right, we're partners.

811
01:17:40,371 --> 01:17:43,211
Lieutenant,
we only expected one visitor.

812
01:17:43,571 --> 01:17:45,331
He goes wherever I go.

813
01:17:45,366 --> 01:17:46,709
We're partners.

814
01:17:46,744 --> 01:17:48,017
Suit yourself.

815
01:17:48,052 --> 01:17:50,897
Sergeant, search 'em for weapons.

816
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:53,812
- I don't carry a gun.
- Raise your arms, sir.

817
01:18:03,732 --> 01:18:05,857
That's very impressive.

818
01:18:05,892 --> 01:18:08,773
Escort them
to Colonel Fitzgerald's office.

819
01:18:36,494 --> 01:18:38,739
What's that?

820
01:18:38,774 --> 01:18:41,594
It's a restricted area, sir.

821
01:18:41,629 --> 01:18:44,414
- Restricted?
- Yes, sir.

822
01:18:45,214 --> 01:18:47,734
- Can I see it?
- Sir, that area is restricted.

823
01:18:47,769 --> 01:18:50,614
I cannot take you there.

824
01:18:58,255 --> 01:19:01,135
You know, Coolidge...

825
01:19:01,495 --> 01:19:04,375
Take this.

826
01:19:06,935 --> 01:19:08,815
Stash the car.
I'll meet you later.

827
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:11,695
- Be careful.
- Yeah.

828
01:21:03,101 --> 01:21:05,741
It's locked?

829
01:21:05,776 --> 01:21:08,621
Locked.

830
01:21:13,981 --> 01:21:16,821
Wait here, I'll go around back.

831
01:21:58,423 --> 01:22:01,303
Lieutenant Hoover?

832
01:22:12,944 --> 01:22:15,824
What is it?

833
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:20,864
Cancer.

834
01:22:20,984 --> 01:22:23,864
It's in my blood, my bones.

835
01:22:24,744 --> 01:22:27,624
Even now, they tell me, in my brain.

836
01:22:28,904 --> 01:22:31,785
You've never seen anyone
with terminal cancer, have you?

837
01:22:33,025 --> 01:22:35,905
I saw a whole roomful
of terminal cancer on my way in.

838
01:22:39,105 --> 01:22:41,945
The hundred who died
so that the thousand might live.

839
01:22:45,905 --> 01:22:48,785
What were they, experiments?

840
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:52,946
Think of them as soldiers.

841
01:22:57,826 --> 01:23:00,666
They didn't seem like soldiers to me.

842
01:23:01,986 --> 01:23:04,546
That's why you killed Allison.

843
01:23:04,581 --> 01:23:05,951
My God, Lieutenant.

844
01:23:05,986 --> 01:23:08,866
Why would I kill Allison?

845
01:23:09,346 --> 01:23:12,186
She showed me pleasures
I never dreamed existed.

846
01:23:14,627 --> 01:23:17,467
It's all I think about these days.

847
01:23:20,387 --> 01:23:23,267
I'm sure you understand that.

848
01:23:29,827 --> 01:23:32,152
It was a mistake.

849
01:23:32,187 --> 01:23:35,068
What do you mean, it was a mistake?

850
01:23:35,228 --> 01:23:38,108
Her death.

851
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:41,268
An error in judgment.

852
01:23:41,628 --> 01:23:44,508
An overzealous reaction...

853
01:23:44,668 --> 01:23:47,548
against a perceived threat
to national security.

854
01:23:52,308 --> 01:23:55,188
She saw the cancer ward.

855
01:23:55,508 --> 01:23:57,954
She took pictures.

856
01:23:57,989 --> 01:24:00,829
You're much more intelligent
than you appear to be, Lieutenant.

857
01:24:02,589 --> 01:24:05,469
Must be a big advantage in your field.

858
01:24:05,629 --> 01:24:07,469
In my field,
everyone was always so desperate

859
01:24:07,504 --> 01:24:10,349
to seem cleverer than they were.

860
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:27,910
- What is that?
- Film.

861
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:31,150
Of you and Allison.

862
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:38,270
She was spectacular, wasn't she?

863
01:24:41,831 --> 01:24:44,711
Drop the gun, Lieutenant.

864
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:51,396
What now, Colonel?

865
01:24:51,431 --> 01:24:54,231
Sir, they breached security,
they intended to harm you.

866
01:24:54,266 --> 01:24:57,111
No, they brought me a film.

867
01:24:57,271 --> 01:24:58,991
Pardon me, sir,
but they've compromised

868
01:24:59,026 --> 01:25:00,796
top secret scientific areas.

869
01:25:00,831 --> 01:25:02,677
We have a test scheduled in one hour.

870
01:25:02,712 --> 01:25:05,592
I understand that perfectly, Colonel.
These men are not enemies.

871
01:25:06,272 --> 01:25:09,152
Perhaps you could see to it that
they are taken back to Los Angeles.

872
01:25:09,592 --> 01:25:12,472
With all due respect, General,
security for this particular installation-

873
01:25:12,752 --> 01:25:15,632
Colonel...

874
01:25:16,072 --> 01:25:18,912
Take them back now.

875
01:25:20,792 --> 01:25:22,312
All right.

876
01:25:22,347 --> 01:25:25,153
Sir.

877
01:25:46,594 --> 01:25:48,479
The captain and I
have business in Los Angeles.

878
01:25:48,514 --> 01:25:50,474
We're gonna catch a ride down
with you if you don't mind.

879
01:25:50,509 --> 01:25:53,314
It's your plane.

880
01:25:59,354 --> 01:26:02,234
- Let's take it up.
- Roger.

881
01:26:20,755 --> 01:26:23,080
How come there's no door?
It's very loud.

882
01:26:23,115 --> 01:26:25,955
This plane is rigged for jumping.
You won't be uncomfortable.

883
01:26:56,317 --> 01:26:58,637
They're gonna throw us
out of the plane,

884
01:26:58,672 --> 01:27:01,477
just like they did Allison Pond.

885
01:27:03,317 --> 01:27:06,197
You gave us the wrong film,
Lieutenant.

886
01:27:06,477 --> 01:27:09,357
I'm not interested in police
training films about the clap.

887
01:27:10,757 --> 01:27:12,677
Everything you have
for everything we have-

888
01:27:12,712 --> 01:27:14,955
that was the understanding.

889
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:17,163
But you see, there's a problem.

890
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:20,078
- You sent the film to my house.
- That was to get your attention.

891
01:27:20,798 --> 01:27:23,678
No copies were sent to the press
or the Los Angeles Police Department.

892
01:27:24,358 --> 01:27:27,238
You see, the problem is you sent the
film to my house addressed to my wife.

893
01:27:31,398 --> 01:27:33,163
And she watched it.

894
01:27:33,198 --> 01:27:36,079
I don't care who sees it now.

895
01:27:36,999 --> 01:27:39,879
See what I mean?

896
01:27:41,719 --> 01:27:44,599
I don't have anything to lose.

897
01:27:50,319 --> 01:27:52,524
Does Timms know about this?

898
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:53,964
The general's no longer relevant.

899
01:27:53,999 --> 01:27:56,364
Who made the decision
to throw her out of the plane?

900
01:27:56,399 --> 01:27:58,920
If such a thing had happened, the
general wouldn't have been informed.

901
01:27:58,955 --> 01:28:01,200
He wouldn't have made that decision.

902
01:28:01,235 --> 01:28:02,965
Of course not.

903
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,880
Would it have been you?

904
01:28:05,915 --> 01:28:08,165
That's right.

905
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,080
If he couldn't intervene on her part,
he can't intervene to save you.

906
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:18,280
No one can intervene here, Lieutenant.

907
01:28:23,601 --> 01:28:26,441
They threw Allison out of the plane.

908
01:28:26,641 --> 01:28:29,481
- They threw her out of the plane, Max.
- That's right.

909
01:28:30,961 --> 01:28:33,801
You threw that little girl out of a plane!

910
01:29:22,763 --> 01:29:25,364
You're pathetic, Hoover!

911
01:29:25,399 --> 01:29:27,689
I did my job!

912
01:29:27,724 --> 01:29:30,604
She died because she was in the way!

913
01:29:30,844 --> 01:29:33,724
She died for nothing, you son of a bitch!

914
01:29:37,484 --> 01:29:40,364
Hold on, Max.

915
01:29:42,804 --> 01:29:44,424
What the hell's going on in here?

916
01:29:44,459 --> 01:29:46,044
- What's happening?
- Oh, my God.

917
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:48,022
Is he all right?

918
01:29:48,057 --> 01:29:49,965
He's been shot, Max.

919
01:29:52,885 --> 01:29:54,450
Is he dead?

920
01:29:54,485 --> 01:29:56,285
Come on, get up!
Come on!

921
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,050
Get up! Wake up.
He's alive!

922
01:29:58,085 --> 01:30:00,965
You fly this plane, or I'll fucking kill you
right here, you hear me?!

923
01:30:04,045 --> 01:30:06,925
Stay awake. We gotta land
this plane now, or he's gonna die on us.

924
01:30:07,005 --> 01:30:08,691
Come on.
We need you to fly the plane.

925
01:30:08,726 --> 01:30:11,126
- You gotta fly this plane.
- We need you to fly the plane!

926
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:12,766
Stay awake.
Come on, come on.

927
01:30:12,801 --> 01:30:15,646
That's it.

928
01:30:30,767 --> 01:30:33,647
Oh, Jesus!

929
01:31:01,608 --> 01:31:04,488
We made it, Max!

930
01:31:07,928 --> 01:31:10,268
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

931
01:31:10,303 --> 01:31:12,608
Yeah, I'm okay.
You all right?

932
01:31:15,449 --> 01:31:17,054
I feel cold, Max.

933
01:31:17,089 --> 01:31:19,909
Jesus Christ, Ellery,
how can you be cold?

934
01:31:19,944 --> 01:31:22,729
We're in the middle
of a goddamn desert!

935
01:31:23,769 --> 01:31:25,534
Max, I gotta sit.

936
01:31:25,569 --> 01:31:28,449
All right, go ahead and sit down.

937
01:31:34,209 --> 01:31:37,090
Hey, Max?

938
01:31:39,330 --> 01:31:41,410
- What happened?
- Max, I think I'm shot.

939
01:31:41,445 --> 01:31:43,415
Let me see.

940
01:31:43,450 --> 01:31:46,330
- I'm shot.
- Oh, my God.

941
01:31:53,530 --> 01:31:56,410
My psychiatrist
is not gonna like this, Max.

942
01:32:00,731 --> 01:32:02,856
I'm cold.

943
01:32:02,891 --> 01:32:05,771
You know, while it was
all happening in there, Max...

944
01:32:08,091 --> 01:32:10,456
...I felt good again.

945
01:32:10,491 --> 01:32:12,216
It was like it used to be.

946
01:32:12,251 --> 01:32:14,171
Ellery, don't talk, save your strength.

947
01:32:14,206 --> 01:32:17,051
- Save your strength.
- Why?

948
01:32:17,651 --> 01:32:20,532
I like to talk, Max.
You know me.

949
01:32:21,572 --> 01:32:24,452
You gotta get it out, right?

950
01:32:28,252 --> 01:32:31,092
Tell me the truth.

951
01:32:31,772 --> 01:32:34,652
Is there something wrong with me?

952
01:32:34,852 --> 01:32:37,732
Ellery, listen to me.
Listen to me.

953
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:40,732
There's nothing wrong with you.

954
01:32:41,052 --> 01:32:43,933
- You mean it?
- Yeah. Listen to me.

955
01:32:44,093 --> 01:32:46,973
- You wouldn't lie to me, right, Max?
- No, no, no.

956
01:32:47,053 --> 01:32:49,933
We're partners, right?
We're partners.

957
01:32:51,693 --> 01:32:52,978
- Partners.
- Yeah.

958
01:32:53,013 --> 01:32:55,893
- Right.
- That's right.

959
01:32:56,613 --> 01:32:58,218
We're partners, Max.

960
01:32:58,253 --> 01:33:01,133
No, come on, Ellery.
Come on, come on, stay awake.

961
01:33:01,168 --> 01:33:02,533
No, no.
Come on, come on, come on.

962
01:33:02,568 --> 01:33:04,951
Stay awake.
Come on, come on.

963
01:33:04,986 --> 01:33:07,334
Stay awake!
Come on back!

964
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:12,214
Ellery, come on!

965
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:28,700
I hear they broke up the squad.

966
01:35:28,940 --> 01:35:31,820
I broke up the squad.

967
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:37,901
There's no squad without Ellery.

968
01:35:41,181 --> 01:35:44,061
What are you gonna do?

969
01:35:47,141 --> 01:35:49,666
I don't know.

970
01:35:49,701 --> 01:35:52,541
I honestly don't know.

971
01:36:00,262 --> 01:36:03,142
Did you ever think
about leaving me for her, Max?

972
01:36:06,102 --> 01:36:08,982
No, Kate. No.

973
01:36:10,342 --> 01:36:13,182
Why'd you stop seeing her?

974
01:36:15,462 --> 01:36:17,827
Kate, I love you.

975
01:36:17,862 --> 01:36:20,703
I have always loved you.

976
01:36:22,623 --> 01:36:25,503
When I realized
what a mistake I had made,

977
01:36:25,703 --> 01:36:28,543
I just didn't want it between us.

978
01:36:35,223 --> 01:36:38,103
But it is.

979
01:36:43,584 --> 01:36:46,464
I guess it always will be.

980
01:36:51,664 --> 01:36:54,544
It'll never be the same, Max.

981
01:36:59,984 --> 01:37:02,864
- Let's go, Eddie.
- Let's get out of here.

982
01:37:12,065 --> 01:37:13,465
Kate

983
01:37:20,765 --> 01:37:23,645
You broke my heart, Max.
