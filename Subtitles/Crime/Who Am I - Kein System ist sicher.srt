1
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,490
<i>If I had known how everything was going to happen</i>

2
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:33,160
<i>I would have done everything differently.</i>

3
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:42,407
<i>I would have stayed invisible.</i>

4
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:43,916
<i>A nobody.</i>

5
00:00:49,554 --> 00:00:50,551
<i>But I'm no longer a nobody.</i>

6
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:54,152
<i>I'm one of the most wanted hackers in the word.</i>

7
00:01:25,238 --> 00:01:25,644
<i>Who am I?</i>

8
00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:27,344
<i>I am Benjamin.</i>

9
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:29,039
<i>And this is my story.</i>

10
00:02:04,856 --> 00:02:05,819
He's learned his lesson.

11
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:07,838
He claims he's done with hacking.

12
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,649
He said he can lead us to Fr13nds and Russian cyber mafia

13
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:12,374
He wants to talk only to you.

14
00:02:18,594 --> 00:02:19,970
And you are...whoami?

15
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,064
There's a reason why you're here.

16
00:02:28,385 --> 00:02:29,327
A reason I'm here for.

17
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,368
So?

18
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,522
<i>Everything is somehow connected.</i>

19
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:37,810
<i>Everything that has a beginning has an end.</i>

20
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,252
<i>It's a mix of everything</i>

21
00:02:41,076 --> 00:02:41,871
<i>And I'm in the middle.</i>

22
00:02:48,206 --> 00:02:49,949
<i>I always wanted to be a superhero</i>

23
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:51,238
<i>with a superpower</i>

24
00:02:51,975 --> 00:02:53,973
<i>I wanted to do things that nobody thought possible.</i>

25
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:57,700
<i>In reality I already had a superpower</i>

26
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,830
<i>I was invisible.</i>

27
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:01,661
<i>And I also had a superhero costume.</i>

28
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:03,706
Paradise Pizza : the end of the rainbow

29
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:06,880
<i>Every superhero needs a tragic family story:</i>

30
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:08,580
<i>Spiderman's parents</i>

31
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,818
Dead.

32
00:03:10,305 --> 00:03:11,201
<i>Batman's parents</i>

33
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:12,247
<i>Killed.</i>

34
00:03:13,047 --> 00:03:13,938
<i>Superman's parents</i>

35
00:03:14,558 --> 00:03:15,377
<i>Exploded.</i>

36
00:03:15,784 --> 00:03:17,706
<i>I actually had the best requirements</i>

37
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:21,813
<i>My dad ran away to France when I was born.</i>

38
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,563
<i>I've never met him.</i>

39
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:27,089
<i>A similarity that I share with my grandma.</i>

40
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,068
<i>Her father died in the Second World War</i>

41
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,330
<i>The only memory she has from him</i>

42
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:37,204
<i>are three bullet casings his comrade brought from foreign countries</i>

43
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,411
<i>My mom took her own life when I was 8</i>

44
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:51,082
<i>The best material for a hero story.</i>

45
00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:54,281
<i>My grandma took care of me</i>

46
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:55,835
<i>and later I took care of her.</i>

47
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:59,220
I'm not a psychologist.

48
00:03:59,652 --> 00:04:01,719
I don't care about your dreams.

49
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,957
What do you know about CLAY?

50
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:06,428
About your alliance with the Fr13nds?

51
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:10,389
Everything you want to know.

52
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:19,207
<i>But every detail is important.</i>

53
00:04:24,486 --> 00:04:25,886
<i>Hacking is like magic</i>

54
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:30,848
<i>They're both about deceiving the others.</i>

55
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:35,914
<i>Since I was 14 I spent my time in front of the PC.</i>

56
00:04:36,286 --> 00:04:37,953
<i>I learned programming languages</i>

57
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,693
<i>Hacked my first system.</i>

58
00:04:40,393 --> 00:04:42,926
<i>A universe of infinite possibilities.</i>

59
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:47,233
<i>For the first time I felt like I was good at something.</i>

60
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:49,706
<i>In real life I was a zero among ones.</i>

61
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,900
<i>An outsider.</i>

62
00:04:51,147 --> 00:04:51,947
<i>A loser.</i>

63
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:52,999
<i>A freak.</i>

64
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:55,452
<i>But on the Internet I felt a sense of belonging.</i>

65
00:05:01,822 --> 00:05:03,822
<i>A refuge for people like me.</i>

66
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,626
<i>Everyone who wasted their time on the World-Wide-Web</i>

67
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:09,860
<i>met here in the so-called "darknet"</i>

68
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:11,899
<i>The Internet within the Internet</i>

69
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:14,097
<i>Here I could be whoever I wanted.</i>

70
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:17,488
<i>I spent days and nights on the PC.</i>

71
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,384
<i>Then I slept in the real world.</i>

72
00:05:21,894 --> 00:05:23,560
<i>But there was an antidote</i>

73
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:26,126
I got the idea from my biggest idol.

74
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:29,284
<i>There are a lot of great hackers out there.</i>

75
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,633
<i>There was only one true hero for me</i>

76
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,949
<i>He called himself "MRX"</i>

77
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:36,013
<i>He is from nowhere</i>

78
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:37,872
<i>No one knew who he was.</i>

79
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,671
<i>He could hack into any system.</i>

80
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,840
<i>He was a real star</i>

81
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:44,798
<i>One of his most famous hacks was a social network attack</i>

82
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:48,492
<i>He didn't take anything or anyone seriously.</i>

83
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,882
<i>He was the superhero among all hackers.</i>

84
00:05:50,962 --> 00:05:52,562
<i>I wanted to be like him.</i>

85
00:05:52,948 --> 00:05:56,215
<i>He had an exploit used to manipulate an online pharmacy</i>

86
00:05:56,212 --> 00:05:57,212
<i>to get Ritalin</i>

87
00:05:58,476 --> 00:05:59,876
<i>The hacker's watchman</i>

88
00:06:01,171 --> 00:06:02,238
MRX had 3 rules:

89
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:10,982
3rd: Have fun in cyberspace and meatspace

90
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:15,408
In other words, don't limit your fun, don't enjoy things only in the virtual world

91
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:18,182
<i>But the real reason I sit here now</i>

92
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:20,137
<i>why everything happened this way</i>

93
00:06:20,156 --> 00:06:21,156
<i>is Marie.</i>

94
00:06:22,473 --> 00:06:24,873
Hey! Just resting hasn't helped anyone so far.

95
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:28,850
Hope is the rainbow over the waterfall of our life.

96
00:06:29,734 --> 00:06:31,967
Do you still want to pass the exam?

97
00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:33,402
Try with learning!

98
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:36,018
Or do you hope someone will steal the exam questions for you?

99
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:38,561
I called Superman but he had no time.

100
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:42,117
Retard!

101
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:46,299
What kind of weirdo bird are you?

102
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,300
Paradise Pizza

103
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:48,138
The end of the rain-...

104
00:06:48,138 --> 00:06:49,338
-bow.

105
00:06:50,014 --> 00:06:53,747
<i>During the school time I was desperately in love with Marie.</i>

106
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:58,610
<i>But after ten years no one still remembers the freak from the last row.</i>

107
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:09,561
That'll be 34.28

108
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:12,912
I said without anchovy

109
00:07:12,908 --> 00:07:14,308
I'm not paying for this!

110
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:16,142
Don't be an ass, Oscar!

111
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,643
The rest is for you.

112
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:19,379
What? Are you crazy?

113
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:23,125
Mr. Anchovy gives you a hundred more if you get the exam questions.

114
00:07:23,173 --> 00:07:24,240
Bachelor of Laws

115
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,754
The world doesn't need a savior

116
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:31,856
but everyday I hear people crying for one.

117
00:07:32,797 --> 00:07:33,797
What?

118
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,549
That's Superman

119
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:42,483
It's okay.

120
00:07:42,706 --> 00:07:43,706
Thanks.

121
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:46,734
You're such a jerk!

122
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,760
<i>I finally wanted to be a superhero.</i>

123
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:53,403
<i>Marie had a problem</i>

124
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,930
<i>and I could solve it.</i>

125
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:57,963
<i>I just had to get her the exam questions.</i>

126
00:07:58,328 --> 00:07:59,228
<i>She'll remember me.</i>

127
00:07:59,513 --> 00:07:59,946
<i>We'll fall in love</i>

128
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,220
<i>get married</i>

129
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:02,064
<i>have kids</i>

130
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:02,834
<i>be happy together</i>

131
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:04,034
<i>Bingo.</i>

132
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:15,303
<i>The bachelor exam questions were stored on
the central server of the university</i>

133
00:08:16,024 --> 00:08:17,957
<i>All I needed was access.</i>

134
00:08:18,896 --> 00:08:20,229
<i>It was way too easy.</i>

135
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:24,419
<i>Most of the hackers only pass through</i>

136
00:08:25,462 --> 00:08:28,795
<i>They appear in the system without changing a thing</i>

137
00:08:29,105 --> 00:08:30,372
<i>Others leave a hint</i>

138
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,411
<i>and many take a souvenir.</i>

139
00:08:41,637 --> 00:08:43,837
<i>I was Superman, Spiderman, Batman</i>

140
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:47,188
What are you doing there?

141
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:48,365
<i>I was an idiot.</i>

142
00:08:49,998 --> 00:08:52,264
No entries, no previous conviction

143
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:55,975
50 hours of community service

144
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:56,986
Do something with your life!

145
00:08:57,313 --> 00:08:58,313
It's up to you!

146
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:12,538
<i>My 50 hours of community service meant cleaning a city I didn't care about</i>

147
00:09:15,397 --> 00:09:17,063
<i>It couldn't be any worse.</i>

148
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,372
<i>Not even the ritalin worked anymore.</i>

149
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:26,739
<i>But everything had to change in one fell swoop.</i>

150
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:41,779
And? why are you here?

151
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:47,335
Can't you speak or what?

152
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:51,611
Then no.

153
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:55,332
Let me guess...

154
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:59,101
you're one of those guys who thinks life's unfair for them

155
00:09:59,113 --> 00:10:00,113
who feels like only passing by

156
00:10:00,147 --> 00:10:01,147
invisible

157
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:02,156
just as the rest of society

158
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,837
In school you weren't even beaten up

159
00:10:03,928 --> 00:10:04,928
because nobody gave a damn about you

160
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:07,482
That's all really really sad.

161
00:10:08,746 --> 00:10:10,413
Do you know what I think?

162
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:12,302
it's all just a scam.

163
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:17,037
Computer stuff.

164
00:10:21,244 --> 00:10:22,244
And you?

165
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:28,322
This and that

166
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:31,679
What kind of things? huh?

167
00:10:31,746 --> 00:10:32,746
DDoS attacks?

168
00:10:32,827 --> 00:10:33,827
Botnets?

169
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:34,962
Phishing?

170
00:10:36,673 --> 00:10:38,806
Or are you just a script kiddie?

171
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:40,827
I hacked the University's server.

172
00:10:40,914 --> 00:10:41,914
How did you manage to gain access?

173
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:44,502
Using a 0Day Exploit.

174
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:47,105
You know how to read machine language?

175
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:48,204
Simply as that?

176
00:10:48,684 --> 00:10:49,284
Mhm

177
00:10:54,245 --> 00:10:55,245
I am Max.

178
00:10:57,771 --> 00:10:58,771
Benjamin.

179
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:01,239
Any plans for today?

180
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:07,067
<i>I keep wondering if there's a moment that pulls all strings together</i>

181
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,734
<i>That moment which changes everything</i>

182
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,967
The later the evening gets, the more drunk the guests become

183
00:11:58,046 --> 00:11:59,046
How do you like my modest temple?

184
00:12:08,798 --> 00:12:11,531
I don't even know half of these people.

185
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:12,708
All shit suckers!

186
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:16,002
<i>Max was the total opposite of me</i>

187
00:12:16,246 --> 00:12:18,046
Self-confident, charismatic

188
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,238
A winner

189
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,950
Close the door!

190
00:12:31,683 --> 00:12:32,516
Let me introduce you

191
00:12:32,556 --> 00:12:33,556
This is Benjamin.

192
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:43,687
Stefan

193
00:12:44,684 --> 00:12:45,684
Benjamin

194
00:12:46,148 --> 00:12:47,148
Benjamin Engel.

195
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,625
<i>Stefan was the software master</i>

196
00:12:49,796 --> 00:12:51,829
<i>He could find a bug in any application</i>

197
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,830
<i>He's always been completely insane.</i>

198
00:12:54,104 --> 00:12:55,271
<i>He loved the thrill</i>

199
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,200
craziness

200
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:57,211
and so on

201
00:12:59,963 --> 00:13:00,963
No last name.

202
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:02,897
<i>Paul was the hardware freak</i>

203
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:06,851
<i>Give him a paper clip and a motherboard and he'll build anything you want.</i>

204
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,919
<i>Like me, he lost his mother early.</i>

205
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:11,053
<i>His rich father left him at an orphanage</i>

206
00:13:11,102 --> 00:13:12,102
<i>so he could focus on the important things.</i>

207
00:13:13,924 --> 00:13:16,857
Don't worry! His smile muscles were removed at birth.

208
00:13:16,951 --> 00:13:17,951
Max said that you can read machine language

209
00:13:19,403 --> 00:13:20,436
Machine language?

210
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:21,536
Anyone can say that!

211
00:13:22,113 --> 00:13:24,446
It's not something that's easy to prove!

212
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:26,501
Prove it!

213
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:30,001
Or you won't leave alive.

214
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:30,970
Angel

215
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:12,625
Paul

216
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:14,688
Benjamin

217
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:16,303
Just Benjamin

218
00:14:16,782 --> 00:14:18,049
The fun begins now!

219
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:27,229
Don't worry!

220
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:29,065
We're not the swindlers

221
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:36,201
What? Did you think that I live here?

222
00:14:36,736 --> 00:14:37,736
Come on!

223
00:14:44,603 --> 00:14:45,603
Come on! Go!

224
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:52,986
Make way!

225
00:14:57,783 --> 00:14:59,250
You're the pizza bird!

226
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:02,004
Do you know each other?

227
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:05,005
It's his party!

228
00:15:10,324 --> 00:15:11,324
What the fuck?

229
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:32,935
No last name.

230
00:15:36,463 --> 00:15:38,330
I always stopped at warnings

231
00:15:39,336 --> 00:15:41,469
never asked myself again after that

232
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:46,014
I can't anymore

233
00:15:46,315 --> 00:15:47,482
I can't go any further

234
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:51,287
See ya after!

235
00:15:57,896 --> 00:15:59,162
Now I remember you!

236
00:15:59,844 --> 00:16:01,511
Benjamin! Benjamin Engel!

237
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:05,107
Our teacher forgot about you

238
00:16:05,653 --> 00:16:08,653
and then you had to take the train back home!

239
00:16:13,962 --> 00:16:15,362
It was interesting...

240
00:16:15,915 --> 00:16:16,915
..the evening

241
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:19,875
Bye!

242
00:16:22,638 --> 00:16:23,638
Bye.

243
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:23,787
We all knew that this day will come.

244
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:26,969
Your grandma needs professional help.

245
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:28,884
You must let go!

246
00:17:36,376 --> 00:17:38,176
She's on really good hands.

247
00:17:40,816 --> 00:17:44,616
<i>My grandma was diagnosticated with Alzheimer 4 years ago.</i>

248
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:49,239
<i>Since then it's like an invisible eraser deletes her borders.</i>

249
00:18:12,238 --> 00:18:13,305
Tickets, please!

250
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:17,417
I thought the cops have caught you!

251
00:18:20,137 --> 00:18:24,337
It wasn't a good idea in the very first week to close the exit.

252
00:18:30,445 --> 00:18:31,445
What's wrong?

253
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:42,344
You'll feel better.

254
00:18:42,903 --> 00:18:44,903
Come on! I show you something!

255
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:47,884
Come on!

256
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,947
<i>I should have stayed there sitting</i>

257
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:51,797
<i>But it was like between us was an invisible rope.</i>

258
00:18:53,903 --> 00:18:56,437
<i>He told me how he started with hacking</i>

259
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,490
<i>I was all ears.</i>

260
00:18:57,943 --> 00:19:01,409
There are people out there, they think they're safe

261
00:19:02,061 --> 00:19:04,228
They have no idea what's going on.

262
00:19:04,237 --> 00:19:05,537
Security. Everyone wants security.

263
00:19:06,182 --> 00:19:07,715
Security doesn't exist!

264
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:10,542
Once you understand this, you know

265
00:19:11,538 --> 00:19:14,671
it's like you have the world served on a plate.

266
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:16,142
You only have to get it!

267
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,980
<i>Even though we were so different, we had something in common.</i>

268
00:19:19,268 --> 00:19:21,968
First: Don't enjoy your actions only in the virtual world

269
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:22,976
Second: aim for the impossible

270
00:19:23,472 --> 00:19:24,939
3rd: No system is safe

271
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:26,861
MRX!

272
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:31,208
Never hide behind your computer.

273
00:19:31,262 --> 00:19:32,262
MRX already knows this.

274
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,938
The main vulnerability isn't in applications or servers

275
00:19:36,036 --> 00:19:37,036
Man is the main security flaw.

276
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,544
You hack people?

277
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:39,731
Exactly.

278
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:43,916
The most effective of all hacking methods, the great art of deceiving:

279
00:19:44,003 --> 00:19:45,003
Social engineering

280
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:50,981
Man is by default trusting and confiding

281
00:19:51,195 --> 00:19:53,428
Social engineering uses these two components

282
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:54,437
so that you can get anything you want:

283
00:19:54,937 --> 00:19:57,670
Passwords, secret information, login data

284
00:20:00,936 --> 00:20:01,936
Hungry?

285
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:11,004
Hold this!

286
00:20:26,335 --> 00:20:28,935
How many chocodonuts do I get for this?

287
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:34,133
It's a new sales pitch? huh?

288
00:20:34,188 --> 00:20:35,188
Pay for 10, get 8!

289
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:36,521
For those with chocolate it wasn't available.

290
00:20:36,913 --> 00:20:38,780
What would I stand here for?

291
00:20:40,132 --> 00:20:41,332
Who required this?

292
00:20:43,466 --> 00:20:44,999
That blonde from there!

293
00:20:47,753 --> 00:20:50,487
Come on! I'm hungry and got things to do!

294
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:58,865
There you go!

295
00:20:58,879 --> 00:20:59,879
Have a good evening!

296
00:21:03,565 --> 00:21:04,565
All good!

297
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:06,729
You must be bold enough!

298
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:09,380
Then the world is at your feet

299
00:21:10,657 --> 00:21:11,790
Oh! Already late!

300
00:21:12,255 --> 00:21:13,255
Are you ready?

301
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:14,728
Come on let's go.

302
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:15,798
But...

303
00:21:28,201 --> 00:21:29,468
Where are we going?

304
00:21:41,613 --> 00:21:42,613
Come on!

305
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:44,803
Go!

306
00:21:57,507 --> 00:21:58,974
Why did you bring him?

307
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:01,702
You don't know if we can trust him!

308
00:22:03,054 --> 00:22:04,921
You already saw what he can.

309
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:13,509
You can drive.

310
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:18,965
Don't make a big deal out of this! We'll bring it back!

311
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:38,335
Looking like this, you'll never get in!

312
00:22:41,464 --> 00:22:42,598
Why does he come?

313
00:22:44,044 --> 00:22:45,277
I thought I come with you!

314
00:22:45,344 --> 00:22:46,044
What are you up to?

315
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,119
Not "you", "we" !

316
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,230
Come on! Get dressed!

317
00:22:49,575 --> 00:22:50,375
Chop-chop!

318
00:22:51,023 --> 00:22:52,023
This wasn't part of the plan!

319
00:22:56,923 --> 00:22:57,923
Let's go!

320
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:03,673
Good luck!

321
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:04,857
Don't you come with us?

322
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:05,934
I'd rather not!

323
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,704
Let's go, my young boy!

324
00:23:19,723 --> 00:23:22,123
<i>The identification card was a small simple piece of paper</i>

325
00:23:22,126 --> 00:23:23,126
<i>Five minutes of Photoshop</i>

326
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:25,009
<i>Two minutes for printing</i>

327
00:23:25,076 --> 00:23:26,076
<i>Any idiot could do that.</i>

328
00:23:27,484 --> 00:23:28,484
Identity card?

329
00:23:33,216 --> 00:23:34,349
Without despatch!

330
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:37,039
Fellow of the Danish Federation.

331
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:38,419
Without

332
00:23:38,608 --> 00:23:39,741
Without despatch.

333
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,735
One of the guest speakers!

334
00:23:42,252 --> 00:23:43,719
Danish people's front!

335
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,620
What has this to do with hacking?

336
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:04,344
The presentation's laptop

337
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,401
it must be connected to another wifi network

338
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,833
This is your job!

339
00:24:10,678 --> 00:24:13,145
Don't forget! Aim for the impossible!

340
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:18,588
Shit! Shit!

341
00:24:18,745 --> 00:24:19,745
Which?

342
00:24:20,074 --> 00:24:21,341
What other network?

343
00:24:27,343 --> 00:24:28,710
I don't trust the small one!

344
00:24:28,724 --> 00:24:29,724
You don't trust anyone not even yourself!

345
00:24:32,177 --> 00:24:33,810
Listen! They're sick of this!

346
00:24:33,876 --> 00:24:34,876
The Federal Intelligence Service has people everywhere!

347
00:24:35,526 --> 00:24:37,059
They're between us! OK?

348
00:24:37,433 --> 00:24:40,166
They have this kid that never said a lie.

349
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:27,471
I'm invisible!

350
00:25:29,232 --> 00:25:30,232
I'm invisible!

351
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,264
I'm invisible!

352
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:22,047
You assholes!

353
00:26:22,698 --> 00:26:24,565
Time for a bit of blasphemy!

354
00:26:32,131 --> 00:26:33,131
Dear fellows,

355
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:36,539
we're presenting you now our new wallspot!

356
00:26:41,302 --> 00:26:44,502
A small flame that will burn in german's hearts!

357
00:27:10,012 --> 00:27:11,012
Quiet!

358
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,531
Cut! Cut!

359
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,647
The lamers are coming!

360
00:27:26,982 --> 00:27:28,015
Stefan! the keys!

361
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,021
I don't have them!

362
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,440
<i>That was our first action together</i>

363
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:00,018
<i>The birth of something real big.</i>

364
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,588
<i>And I was a part of it.</i>

365
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:09,438
How do I know that what you're telling me, is for real?

366
00:28:13,516 --> 00:28:15,516
17-04-73 6212

367
00:28:16,939 --> 00:28:18,072
What did you say?

368
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:20,041
Your insurance number.

369
00:28:20,556 --> 00:28:21,689
Born in Friedrich

370
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:23,668
studies in Germany

371
00:28:23,686 --> 00:28:25,586
Graduated as the best of the year

372
00:28:25,656 --> 00:28:27,856
Investigator at the European Cybercrime Center in Hague

373
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,480
Two bank accounts: one at Densk Bank

374
00:28:30,498 --> 00:28:31,498
other at Holland Direct Bank

375
00:28:33,535 --> 00:28:36,335
During the study period, you had a problem

376
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:39,859
Since then you couldn't have kids anymore.

377
00:28:40,254 --> 00:28:42,121
Because of an uterus disease

378
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:46,919
Your colleagues consider you cold

379
00:28:47,965 --> 00:28:49,432
I consider you lonely.

380
00:28:55,418 --> 00:28:57,251
<i>We needed a place for hacking</i>

381
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
<i>My grandma's house was the perfect place.</i>

382
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:01,885
This reminds me of the old times.

383
00:29:01,902 --> 00:29:02,902
Having a computer crib or something.

384
00:29:06,593 --> 00:29:07,660
1 million views!

385
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:12,221
We need a name!

386
00:29:12,996 --> 00:29:16,063
We must become a brand! We must become famous!

387
00:29:16,391 --> 00:29:19,291
All what attention generates is counterproductive.

388
00:29:19,321 --> 00:29:20,321
We're staying off the radar.

389
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,367
Fuck the radar!

390
00:29:21,466 --> 00:29:22,366
Brand is awesome!

391
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:23,458
Like Anonymous or Lizardsec!

392
00:29:24,435 --> 00:29:25,435
Like MRX!

393
00:29:26,455 --> 00:29:28,322
Are you all completely nuts?

394
00:29:31,177 --> 00:29:32,177
<i>Max had an idea</i>

395
00:29:32,924 --> 00:29:35,724
<i>If Max had an idea, nothing could stop him</i>

396
00:29:53,656 --> 00:29:55,923
I no longer do this shit with you!

397
00:29:56,582 --> 00:29:57,882
Take the surprise from chocolate!

398
00:29:57,966 --> 00:29:58,866
Take it!

399
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,880
Sure! No problem!

400
00:30:00,236 --> 00:30:01,203
I follow the polls!

401
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,230
Who is "for" ?

402
00:30:08,246 --> 00:30:09,646
We still need a name.

403
00:30:10,263 --> 00:30:11,463
How about "CLAY" ?

404
00:30:12,137 --> 00:30:14,137
as in "Clowns laughing at you"

405
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:18,395
because it's all about fun and because of the mask

406
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,278
Nominated with 4 votes.

407
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:27,385
For CLAY

408
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,320
<i>CLAY's next move was a small greeting to the financial world</i>

409
00:31:43,272 --> 00:31:44,672
We had taken a liking to this.

410
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:45,724
Our next target was a big pharma company.

411
00:32:10,685 --> 00:32:11,485
<i>Max was right</i>

412
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:12,539
<i>The bolder you were, the more you could achieve.</i>

413
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:16,106
<i>We hacked everything we got our hands on.</i>

414
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:17,168
<i>The ritalin kept us awake</i>

415
00:32:17,576 --> 00:32:20,576
<i>We didn't take anything and anyone seriously.</i>

416
00:32:54,161 --> 00:32:55,461
<i>Who hides behind this mask?</i>

417
00:32:55,505 --> 00:32:56,505
<i>Is it a criminal organization</i>

418
00:32:57,662 --> 00:32:59,995
<i>or just a group of rebel teenagers?</i>

419
00:33:21,678 --> 00:33:22,678
Hi!

420
00:33:23,451 --> 00:33:24,717
What are you doing?

421
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,470
Me? Nope.

422
00:33:28,237 --> 00:33:29,237
You?

423
00:33:32,613 --> 00:33:35,213
I'm looking for the man of the rainbow.

424
00:33:36,424 --> 00:33:37,891
<i>Marie? Are you coming?</i>

425
00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:43,246
We must stop meeting in secret!

426
00:33:43,894 --> 00:33:45,627
and also leave our covers!

427
00:33:51,651 --> 00:33:54,151
You're such a fiasco!

428
00:33:54,592 --> 00:33:56,192
You...for you it's easy!

429
00:33:56,733 --> 00:34:00,200
You're...you're different! people are listening to you!

430
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:01,271
You're cool!

431
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,116
Maybe you're right!

432
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:28,575
When life gives you lemons, ask for salt and tequila.

433
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:36,040
<i>Max was marching on</i>

434
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,008
<i>but his mood could change in seconds.</i>

435
00:34:40,569 --> 00:34:44,369
<i>For weeks he tried to get from MRX a reaction about CLAY.</i>

436
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,474
<i>He wanted appreciation from his biggest idol</i>

437
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,636
We are fucking losers!

438
00:35:03,076 --> 00:35:05,409
<i>But MRX didn't give a fuck about us</i>

439
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:08,661
<i>Abroad there was another player.</i>

440
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:12,775
<i>Around this time she entered the game.</i>

441
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:19,739
<i>Now I call on Hanne Lindberg, lead cybercrime investigator of Europol</i>

442
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,447
<i>Yesterday night, was a cyberattack on the European Central Bank of Frankfurt</i>

443
00:35:26,987 --> 00:35:30,120
<i>We found out that the same hackers are involved</i>

444
00:35:30,475 --> 00:35:34,675
<i>which are also behind the attacks on the German Army's servers.</i>

445
00:35:34,894 --> 00:35:36,961
<i>they call themselves "Fr13nds".</i>

446
00:35:39,454 --> 00:35:42,254
Fr13nds is part of the Russian cyber mafia

447
00:35:42,822 --> 00:35:45,822
They hacked as in the past years many international targets.

448
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:46,871
The group has 4 nicknames to locate

449
00:35:47,595 --> 00:35:48,595
3 of them are:

450
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:52,839
The last one is still unknown.

451
00:35:52,853 --> 00:35:54,953
The data they got was sold on the so-called "darknet"

452
00:35:56,399 --> 00:35:59,066
and consumed by the Russian cyber mafia.

453
00:35:59,362 --> 00:36:02,362
According to our newest investigations, at least one of the Fr13nds
 members seems to operate from Berlin.

454
00:36:02,386 --> 00:36:04,786
Our commission joins the Europol investigations.

455
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,933
Nobody knows the Fr13nds and their past actions better than Hanne Lindberg

456
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,107
Is it true that you're tracking the Fr13nds for 3 years

457
00:36:14,123 --> 00:36:15,123
without success?

458
00:36:16,514 --> 00:36:17,514
Yes!

459
00:36:18,872 --> 00:36:20,472
OK. Any other questions?

460
00:36:21,595 --> 00:36:22,395
Good.

461
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,116
Hanne!

462
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:31,407
I just wanted to say...

463
00:36:33,078 --> 00:36:34,144
Glad to see you!

464
00:36:35,322 --> 00:36:37,855
I hope you don't have any problems with this

465
00:36:37,936 --> 00:36:38,936
No!

466
00:36:42,216 --> 00:36:44,216
No. I'm glad to work with you!

467
00:36:45,575 --> 00:36:46,575
Good.

468
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:50,463
One more thing...

469
00:36:52,397 --> 00:36:55,864
The fact that we were together, no one must know it.

470
00:36:56,211 --> 00:36:59,278
People are talking. Must lose the information!

471
00:37:03,475 --> 00:37:07,275
<i>While she was hunting the Fr13nds,
Max tried to get rid of the frustration caused by MRX.</i>

472
00:37:30,303 --> 00:37:31,503
Wanna take a ride?

473
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:34,884
<i>Max and Stefan borrowed one of Paul's toys</i>

474
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,233
<i>and tampered the transmission line of a radio's prize competition</i>

475
00:37:39,305 --> 00:37:40,305
<i>They interrupted all the lines but one</i>

476
00:37:40,923 --> 00:37:43,123
<i>so that Max could be put through.</i>

477
00:37:44,103 --> 00:37:45,003
Hello!

478
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,062
My name is Benjamin Engel.

479
00:37:46,582 --> 00:37:49,315
The correct answer is B: Ottmar Hitzfeld.

480
00:37:55,518 --> 00:37:56,518
Are you crazy?

481
00:37:56,898 --> 00:37:58,698
What has this to do with CLAY?

482
00:37:58,727 --> 00:38:00,627
What kind of fucking message is behind stealing a Porsche?

483
00:38:01,605 --> 00:38:02,872
It's not like that!

484
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:05,031
It's not like a shitty Renault!

485
00:38:06,205 --> 00:38:08,339
Superheros need a superhero car!

486
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:09,375
Exactly!

487
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,804
Moreover it's not stolen, it's won!

488
00:38:13,546 --> 00:38:14,546
Forget it!

489
00:38:46,868 --> 00:38:47,868
Here!

490
00:39:19,162 --> 00:39:20,296
Excuse me, girls!

491
00:39:21,622 --> 00:39:22,889
We were a bit late!

492
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:46,600
These guys are like Windows: it takes a while till they boot up.

493
00:39:51,195 --> 00:39:52,195
Cheers!

494
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:53,296
You can be whoever you want!

495
00:40:54,406 --> 00:40:55,406
Check this out!

496
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,199
Be open minded!

497
00:41:08,237 --> 00:41:12,637
You achieved everything when you completed your ultimate challenge

498
00:41:13,036 --> 00:41:18,170
So can Benjamin, for example, he has a huge potential, but he doesn't use it!

499
00:41:20,324 --> 00:41:23,924
He hides behind the others. He doesn't open his mouth!

500
00:41:24,957 --> 00:41:27,023
If someone must always pull you

501
00:41:27,576 --> 00:41:29,243
then you'll never go far!

502
00:41:29,763 --> 00:41:32,496
Most of the people can only follow rules!

503
00:41:44,947 --> 00:41:46,080
It wasn't enough!

504
00:41:50,414 --> 00:41:53,614
<i>Max was right. I had to finally change something</i>

505
00:42:44,909 --> 00:42:46,109
I passed the exam!

506
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,351
What are you up to now?

507
00:42:53,048 --> 00:42:54,782
Do you know how I made it?

508
00:42:56,113 --> 00:42:57,113
Nope.

509
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:01,930
I've intentionally answered wrong the questions.

510
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:05,001
Why?

511
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:08,646
There are so many possibilities outside.

512
00:43:08,659 --> 00:43:09,759
I had the feeling that is not carved in stone that I pass the exam.

513
00:43:13,218 --> 00:43:15,351
Like all the doors shut forever.

514
00:43:17,103 --> 00:43:19,169
But now I've decided on a door.

515
00:43:25,081 --> 00:43:27,081
Why are you driving a Porsche?

516
00:43:30,015 --> 00:43:32,015
I'm the employee of the month.

517
00:43:37,311 --> 00:43:39,245
Or maybe I'm also a superhero

518
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:40,690
and this is my superhero car

519
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,412
Yeah...maybe

520
00:43:48,545 --> 00:43:50,478
<i>Come on! believe in yourself!</i>

521
00:43:53,065 --> 00:43:54,065
<i>Be like Max</i>

522
00:43:54,621 --> 00:43:56,155
<i>Aim for the impossible!</i>

523
00:44:07,977 --> 00:44:09,110
I'd better go out

524
00:44:19,078 --> 00:44:20,278
It fits to Porsche

525
00:44:42,064 --> 00:44:43,331
Oh look who's here!

526
00:44:43,869 --> 00:44:44,869
The pizza bird!

527
00:44:51,502 --> 00:44:53,169
Get your hands off Marie!

528
00:44:58,045 --> 00:44:59,378
<i>Nothing has changed.</i>

529
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,383
Everything's alright?

530
00:45:09,747 --> 00:45:10,747
Don't ask.

531
00:45:14,201 --> 00:45:15,468
MRX sent a message!

532
00:45:16,937 --> 00:45:19,737
<i>MRX hasn't missed a single word about CLAY</i>

533
00:45:19,912 --> 00:45:21,112
until this moment.

534
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:30,377
<i>In front of us we had the confidential cybercrime investigation
document they sent to Europol</i>

535
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:35,965
<i>It was a marked paragraph about CLAY</i>

536
00:45:40,524 --> 00:45:42,791
<i>The packet's purpose was only one:</i>

537
00:45:42,812 --> 00:45:44,179
<i>He wanted make this clear to us</i>

538
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:46,006
<i>CLAY in his eyes wasn't more</i>

539
00:45:46,063 --> 00:45:47,063
<i>than whining babies.</i>

540
00:45:55,466 --> 00:45:56,466
We'll finish the fucker!

541
00:45:56,506 --> 00:45:57,506
Let's do an attack that tops all!

542
00:46:02,576 --> 00:46:04,043
We could hack a big bank!

543
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,452
Yes! the money of a famous company!

544
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:07,563
Bullshit!

545
00:46:07,707 --> 00:46:09,840
We need an attack on something real huge!

546
00:46:09,937 --> 00:46:10,937
Something able to reach the Olympus!

547
00:46:12,712 --> 00:46:14,312
The Federal Intelligence Service.

548
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,396
What?

549
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:16,630
BND!

550
00:46:19,586 --> 00:46:20,586
The king class.

551
00:46:22,165 --> 00:46:23,899
The German Secret Service.

552
00:46:26,132 --> 00:46:27,265
Bullshit! It's unhackable!

553
00:46:27,357 --> 00:46:28,357
No system is safe.

554
00:46:28,874 --> 00:46:30,674
And aim for the impossible!

555
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:47,634
<i>The BND action must be the most complex we ever did.</i>

556
00:47:46,126 --> 00:47:47,659
Here you go, you pussy!

557
00:47:47,736 --> 00:47:49,003
<i>With the right bait</i>

558
00:47:50,431 --> 00:47:51,964
<i>you can catch any fish.</i>

559
00:47:58,999 --> 00:48:01,732
<i>Without knowing, Gerdi granted us access.</i>

560
00:48:08,935 --> 00:48:13,001
<i>But from her system we still couldn't access the main server.</i>

561
00:48:13,472 --> 00:48:15,472
<i>Gerdi was the jackpot, though.</i>

562
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:18,529
<i>Gerdi was responsible for the card cloning</i>

563
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:19,628
<i>and for distribution of the entry-cards to BND.</i>

564
00:48:21,112 --> 00:48:23,045
Accepted by password or address?

565
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:24,101
<i>It was the all time biggest breaking cliché.</i>

566
00:48:25,856 --> 00:48:26,856
Idiots!

567
00:48:32,236 --> 00:48:34,503
<i>Many tried to hack the BND before.</i>

568
00:48:34,577 --> 00:48:38,177
<i>But you can't do this only by hiding behind your desk.</i>

569
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:42,170
Ready?

570
00:50:58,022 --> 00:50:59,155
Where's Benjamin?

571
00:50:59,691 --> 00:51:00,691
No idea

572
00:51:01,961 --> 00:51:03,295
Where have you been?

573
00:51:06,665 --> 00:51:07,865
<i>We really made it.</i>

574
00:51:13,686 --> 00:51:15,020
<i>That was the Olympus</i>

575
00:51:15,754 --> 00:51:20,021
<i>We haven't just climbed it, we also have put a flag on its peak.</i>

576
00:51:22,727 --> 00:51:27,594
<i>As for BND, the employees will get the next day the shock of their lives.</i>

577
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,028
<i>That was my night</i>

578
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:30,551
Leave me alone!

579
00:53:30,752 --> 00:53:31,752
Let us in!

580
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:34,539
Don't act like a kid!

581
00:53:34,593 --> 00:53:35,593
And you like an asshole!

582
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:37,879
You're nothing without us!

583
00:53:37,888 --> 00:53:38,888
A nobody!

584
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,424
<i>It's enough</i>

585
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:46,620
Nobody.

586
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:49,770
Nobody

587
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:07,510
<i>Without the others knowing it</i>

588
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:08,519
<i>I stole secret data from BND server.</i>

589
00:54:46,384 --> 00:54:50,451
First he has manipulated the printers over
the communication protocol

590
00:54:50,497 --> 00:54:53,197
then he bypassed the security firewall

591
00:54:53,968 --> 00:54:54,968
and stole data.

592
00:54:55,942 --> 00:54:57,342
Our unhackable system

593
00:54:57,876 --> 00:54:59,943
has been hacked in 2 minutes 23

594
00:55:01,701 --> 00:55:04,134
You're saying this like you were excited about it.

595
00:55:04,232 --> 00:55:05,532
Whoever did this is a genius.

596
00:55:06,772 --> 00:55:08,605
We should have had recordings

597
00:55:08,618 --> 00:55:10,618
They deleted all the video files and left something.

598
00:55:20,114 --> 00:55:22,248
<i>But everything has a consequence</i>

599
00:55:22,795 --> 00:55:24,261
<i>Every single fly flap.</i>

600
00:55:26,687 --> 00:55:28,687
That was found about his body.

601
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,774
He was found in the woods.

602
00:55:32,294 --> 00:55:34,827
Moritz Lauer, better known as Krypton.

603
00:55:47,209 --> 00:55:48,209
Morning!

604
00:55:50,689 --> 00:55:51,689
Get out!

605
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,268
Get lost!

606
00:55:56,611 --> 00:55:58,311
What the fuck? you need us!

607
00:55:58,342 --> 00:55:59,142
What?

608
00:55:59,165 --> 00:56:00,165
I need you?

609
00:56:00,382 --> 00:56:01,782
Or maybe you need me!

610
00:56:02,033 --> 00:56:03,166
Do you know what?

611
00:56:03,239 --> 00:56:05,972
You're nothing! you're nothing more than a shitty impostor!

612
00:56:06,037 --> 00:56:08,237
All you can do is using people and manipulate them!

613
00:56:18,419 --> 00:56:19,419
Stop! Stop!

614
00:56:22,987 --> 00:56:23,687
Be quiet!

615
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:24,708
Quiet!

616
00:56:25,825 --> 00:56:30,325
<i>This morning was found the dead body of the hacker
which has the pseudonym "Krypton"</i>

617
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:35,419
<i>His dead and the German Secret Service hack of the last night</i>

618
00:56:36,424 --> 00:56:40,991
confront the BND with something that might be
the biggest scandal of its history.

619
00:56:41,073 --> 00:56:44,973
<i>Near to the dead body, was found the stolen data from BND</i>

620
00:56:45,578 --> 00:56:48,011
<i>A secret employees list</i>

621
00:56:48,511 --> 00:56:51,178
<i>proving that Krypton worked for the BND.</i>

622
00:56:52,472 --> 00:56:56,339
<i>It seems that Krypton belongs to the hackers group Fr13nds</i>

623
00:56:57,641 --> 00:57:01,374
<i>Financed by the BND to collect information about hackers</i>

624
00:57:02,117 --> 00:57:09,350
<i>At this time, the hackers group CLAY
seems responsible for the BND breaking.</i>

625
00:57:12,023 --> 00:57:13,756
You were the only one in the server room!

626
00:57:13,787 --> 00:57:14,787
What have you done there?

627
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:19,032
We said that we don't touch anything,
take anything and turn on only the printers!

628
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:20,070
Did you leave any data?

629
00:57:23,325 --> 00:57:26,458
I've found a hidden partition on the BND server

630
00:57:26,858 --> 00:57:29,124
I have...I've cracked the password

631
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:32,152
and then downloaded some kind of employees list

632
00:57:32,201 --> 00:57:33,201
I don't know...

633
00:57:33,594 --> 00:57:34,727
I sent it to MRX.

634
00:57:34,797 --> 00:57:35,797
Are you crazy?

635
00:57:36,195 --> 00:57:37,661
I wanted to prove him!

636
00:57:38,181 --> 00:57:39,448
I wanted to prove you!

637
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,456
You thought I'm a nobody!

638
00:57:44,103 --> 00:57:47,903
<i>Sometimes we hold so tight a photograph we got from someone.</i>

639
00:57:47,924 --> 00:57:48,924
<i>It was like I couldn't recognize myself anymore.</i>

640
00:57:51,983 --> 00:57:53,849
<i>Everyone sees what they want</i>

641
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,520
<i>Suddenly, it was crystal clear</i>

642
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:06,110
<i>MRX has sold the stolen data to the Russian cyber mafia</i>

643
00:58:08,499 --> 00:58:10,232
MRX belongs to the Fr13nds

644
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:14,591
When he found out that Krypton worked for the BND, he eliminated him!

645
00:58:14,603 --> 00:58:17,003
Now everyone thinks that we did it!

646
00:58:17,784 --> 00:58:19,118
It's only his fault!

647
00:58:28,977 --> 00:58:30,111
Austrian product.

648
00:58:30,402 --> 00:58:34,569
Krypton has been admitted to the government agency and was eliminated.

649
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,494
What has this to do with CLAY?

650
00:58:37,092 --> 00:58:38,092
I don't know.

651
00:58:43,707 --> 00:58:44,707
We could fail.

652
00:58:46,765 --> 00:58:48,698
I received a call from Hague.

653
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:51,508
They wanted me to make an evaluation

654
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:52,860
of you.

655
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:53,980
Your work

656
00:58:58,181 --> 00:59:00,981
I didn't know that your chair isn't stable

657
00:59:01,029 --> 00:59:02,562
Why didn't you tell me?

658
00:59:22,676 --> 00:59:24,009
Where are you going?

659
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:26,961
To find some fun. This isn't fun anymore!

660
00:59:27,102 --> 00:59:28,902
Krypton is dead, Max, dead!

661
00:59:28,994 --> 00:59:31,627
And we'll get fucking blamed for all this scandal!

662
00:59:31,659 --> 00:59:32,659
Benjamin could hand himself over to the police

663
00:59:33,133 --> 00:59:35,766
and tell them how he built alone his shit CLAY!

664
00:59:35,812 --> 00:59:36,812
Do you want sacrifice one of us?

665
00:59:37,477 --> 00:59:39,477
You always wanted to run away!

666
00:59:39,733 --> 00:59:41,233
I don't fuckin' care what you're doing, I'm out!

667
00:59:41,276 --> 00:59:42,276
Stefan! Wait!

668
00:59:43,149 --> 00:59:44,549
This is all my fault!

669
00:59:45,267 --> 00:59:46,334
I must find MRX!

670
00:59:48,287 --> 00:59:49,287
And then what?

671
00:59:49,466 --> 00:59:50,966
It's not about us! it's about MRX

672
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:51,821
the Fr13nds

673
00:59:51,832 --> 00:59:52,732
they are the target!

674
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,800
Benjamin is right. Running away doesn't solve this

675
00:59:54,251 --> 00:59:56,585
There are so many tracks left there

676
00:59:57,004 --> 00:59:59,671
It's just a matter of time till they catch us!

677
00:59:59,728 --> 01:00:01,728
We deliver them MRX and the Fr13nds and we'll become invisible again.

678
01:00:02,454 --> 01:00:03,454
Exactly.

679
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:06,700
When I said "we" I didn't mean "you" too!

680
01:00:30,033 --> 01:00:32,166
Oh my god! what happened to you?

681
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:33,710
I'm fine.

682
01:00:33,913 --> 01:00:35,046
What do you want?

683
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:40,676
...last night you suddenly disappeared and...

684
01:00:40,769 --> 01:00:42,169
and I thought that...

685
01:00:42,646 --> 01:00:44,113
You came here for Max.

686
01:00:44,568 --> 01:00:45,568
Max? No!

687
01:00:47,549 --> 01:00:49,416
It's better that you go now.

688
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:51,970
Are you building there a bomb or what?

689
01:00:53,224 --> 01:00:54,224
Anything else?

690
01:00:56,395 --> 01:00:57,862
What's wrong with you?

691
01:00:58,184 --> 01:00:59,718
You're completely weird

692
01:01:00,112 --> 01:01:01,112
Exactly

693
01:01:01,789 --> 01:01:03,689
That's all you can see, right?

694
01:01:03,749 --> 01:01:04,749
the freak weirdo

695
01:01:05,123 --> 01:01:06,256
Do you know what?

696
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:08,362
I wish I had never met you!

697
01:01:14,069 --> 01:01:15,269
<i>We had to find MRX</i>

698
01:01:16,414 --> 01:01:17,414
<i>I was the decoy</i>

699
01:01:19,443 --> 01:01:23,776
<i>We were lately so paranoic that we could use only public networks</i>

700
01:01:40,398 --> 01:01:41,531
Oh! here are you!

701
01:01:42,647 --> 01:01:43,647
Come on fast!

702
01:01:47,179 --> 01:01:48,712
He tried to contact MRX

703
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:01,127
His IP address is spoofed

704
01:02:01,382 --> 01:02:03,982
he uses 100 different servers in Europe

705
01:02:04,962 --> 01:02:07,929
He's changing his location at every 3 seconds!

706
01:02:07,999 --> 01:02:08,999
I think I got something!

707
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:13,927
The server he uses more often points to this IP address

708
01:02:15,093 --> 01:02:16,093
In Berlin!

709
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:19,065
Get as much information as you can, Katja

710
01:02:20,645 --> 01:02:23,378
<i>He gave me access to his private channel.</i>

711
01:02:24,186 --> 01:02:25,853
What are you waiting for?

712
01:03:18,194 --> 01:03:19,327
We're running out of time!

713
01:03:19,401 --> 01:03:20,534
I almost have it.

714
01:03:43,106 --> 01:03:44,106
They're here!

715
01:03:45,411 --> 01:03:46,411
Did you get it?

716
01:03:46,811 --> 01:03:48,211
Let's get outta here!

717
01:03:49,185 --> 01:03:50,185
Now.

718
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,147
We'll meet downstairs!

719
01:05:12,399 --> 01:05:15,466
Nothing! as if the earth had swallowed him up!

720
01:05:40,445 --> 01:05:41,445
I am suspended.

721
01:05:44,376 --> 01:05:47,309
They're looking for someone else from Hague!

722
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:48,740
I'm sorry

723
01:06:15,677 --> 01:06:17,077
What did MRX ask for?

724
01:06:18,214 --> 01:06:21,614
He wanted us to send a Trojan to the Europol system

725
01:06:23,723 --> 01:06:27,590
If someone has access to Europol, can track investigations

726
01:06:27,948 --> 01:06:28,948
and tamper

727
01:06:29,873 --> 01:06:31,140
What was your plan?

728
01:06:31,912 --> 01:06:33,779
We wanted to know who is MRX

729
01:06:34,176 --> 01:06:36,842
His identity in exchange for our freedom

730
01:06:37,268 --> 01:06:39,668
We wanted to prove that he's behind Krypton's death

731
01:06:39,699 --> 01:06:42,199
We wanted to disappear from the 1st position of the wanted list

732
01:06:42,979 --> 01:06:45,512
We only wanted to be...invisible again

733
01:06:46,301 --> 01:06:47,301
<i>To get access to MRX's computer</i>

734
01:06:47,887 --> 01:06:50,687
<i>we had to reach deeply into our bag of tricks</i>

735
01:06:50,691 --> 01:06:51,691
<i>Stefan called the application
"the pregnant horse"</i>

736
01:06:53,404 --> 01:06:56,037
<i>It was a Trojan horse inside of a Trojan horse.</i>

737
01:06:56,063 --> 01:06:59,763
<i>The second when MRX would log on to the Europol server using our backdoor</i>

738
01:07:00,728 --> 01:07:03,095
<i>we could be able to access his computer.</i>

739
01:07:03,097 --> 01:07:04,097
<i>And MRX's mask would fall.</i>

740
01:07:05,718 --> 01:07:08,718
<i>But before we had to destroy all the evidence</i>

741
01:07:25,825 --> 01:07:27,292
I want to apologise...

742
01:07:29,558 --> 01:07:30,692
for the blue-eyed

743
01:07:32,378 --> 01:07:33,378
like Marie.

744
01:07:39,214 --> 01:07:42,014
You knew all the time what she means to me

745
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,940
and you didn't give a fuck

746
01:07:48,152 --> 01:07:50,219
What can I say? I'm an asshole.

747
01:07:52,626 --> 01:07:54,093
The statement is true.

748
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:04,746
I'm an impostor! I could never do what you can

749
01:08:05,157 --> 01:08:07,290
I'm just a fucking script kiddie

750
01:08:07,781 --> 01:08:09,314
I can't do more than copy/paste!

751
01:08:09,364 --> 01:08:10,364
I don't even know how to program!

752
01:08:13,554 --> 01:08:14,754
I didn't know that

753
01:08:19,144 --> 01:08:20,278
Do you like this?

754
01:08:20,739 --> 01:08:21,739
Love birdies!

755
01:08:52,821 --> 01:08:54,621
<i>We were on the way to Hague</i>

756
01:08:55,084 --> 01:08:56,084
<i>to Europol</i>

757
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,386
<i>We had to get in the lion's den</i>

758
01:08:58,795 --> 01:09:00,262
<i>but the road was long.</i>

759
01:09:02,592 --> 01:09:04,192
<i>We tried several methods</i>

760
01:09:05,239 --> 01:09:06,239
<i>No success.</i>

761
01:09:07,621 --> 01:09:09,221
<i>Our old phishing methods</i>

762
01:09:10,294 --> 01:09:13,494
<i>We even tried to get in across the canalization.</i>

763
01:09:17,573 --> 01:09:19,106
It's the only entrance.

764
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,947
What are you doing there?

765
01:09:29,283 --> 01:09:30,283
A fucking nail!

766
01:09:31,694 --> 01:09:32,694
Take it out!

767
01:09:34,148 --> 01:09:38,148
<i>We had to admit that it was impossible to enter the Europol.</i>

768
01:09:52,959 --> 01:09:54,559
What are you looking at?

769
01:10:01,979 --> 01:10:03,046
<i>It was my fault.</i>

770
01:10:14,171 --> 01:10:15,604
<i>I've dragged us in this</i>

771
01:10:15,703 --> 01:10:16,703
<i>I also had to get us out.</i>

772
01:10:32,883 --> 01:10:35,550
<i>Man is by default trustful and confiding</i>

773
01:10:36,459 --> 01:10:37,725
<i>Social engineering.</i>

774
01:10:43,009 --> 01:10:44,943
<i>Come on! Believe in yourself!</i>

775
01:12:52,755 --> 01:12:55,421
<i>With Paul's box I could access a network</i>

776
01:12:55,528 --> 01:13:00,861
<i>and then a second one, in parallel, a so called "evil twin"</i>

777
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:10,281
<i>If someone had logged in from one of the offices in that network</i>

778
01:13:10,513 --> 01:13:12,313
<i>I could access their laptop</i>

779
01:13:12,749 --> 01:13:14,016
<i>and then the server</i>

780
01:13:16,565 --> 01:13:19,698
<i>MRX gave us an access key to a darknet channel</i>

781
01:13:20,065 --> 01:13:22,532
<i>where we could find the instructions.</i>

782
01:13:24,464 --> 01:13:27,464
<i>I only had to give MRX the manipulated Trojan</i>

783
01:13:28,622 --> 01:13:31,822
<i>As soon as he would log in in the Europol server</i>

784
01:13:32,284 --> 01:13:33,551
<i>his mask would fall</i>

785
01:13:48,339 --> 01:13:49,939
<i>But MRX foiled our trick</i>

786
01:15:39,619 --> 01:15:40,619
<i>MRX won the game</i>

787
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:44,525
<i>and I lost everything</i>

788
01:16:12,191 --> 01:16:13,324
<i>Max, Paul, Stefan</i>

789
01:16:16,784 --> 01:16:17,917
<i>they're all dead.</i>

790
01:16:27,205 --> 01:16:29,005
I want to be Benjamin again

791
01:16:33,170 --> 01:16:35,036
I want to be invisible again

792
01:16:38,262 --> 01:16:41,262
This is Anne! Call me as soon as you wake up!

793
01:16:41,542 --> 01:16:43,609
You must come here immediately!

794
01:17:03,099 --> 01:17:04,366
Finally no one else

795
01:17:10,274 --> 01:17:11,274
You came...

796
01:17:12,764 --> 01:17:13,764
Yeah, I came.

797
01:17:18,831 --> 01:17:23,398
Oscar said that someone hacked the University's server some months ago

798
01:17:23,476 --> 01:17:24,476
and stole the questions for the Bachelor exam

799
01:17:25,983 --> 01:17:26,983
and got caught

800
01:17:34,503 --> 01:17:35,503
You once said that

801
01:17:39,073 --> 01:17:41,007
you must find out who you are

802
01:17:43,538 --> 01:17:46,938
..and that there are a lot of opportunities outside

803
01:17:47,148 --> 01:17:49,214
but you can be whoever you want

804
01:17:49,557 --> 01:17:50,823
you can be anything

805
01:17:51,894 --> 01:17:53,094
Do you understand?

806
01:17:53,821 --> 01:17:55,421
I can be the federation!

807
01:17:55,814 --> 01:17:56,881
You're a weirdo!

808
01:18:20,747 --> 01:18:22,747
Do you come with me?

809
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,399
I already said that you're crazy!

810
01:18:27,694 --> 01:18:28,694
Where?

811
01:18:29,306 --> 01:18:30,106
Wherever you want.

812
01:18:30,107 --> 01:18:31,107
Copenhagen?

813
01:18:31,938 --> 01:18:34,105
You can go anywhere and want to go to Copenhagen?

814
01:18:34,152 --> 01:18:35,152
Why not?

815
01:18:35,868 --> 01:18:36,868
Yeah...

816
01:18:37,485 --> 01:18:38,485
Why not.

817
01:18:49,378 --> 01:18:51,444
What else do you know about me?

818
01:18:52,541 --> 01:18:54,607
Do you know that I'm suspended?

819
01:18:57,608 --> 01:18:59,675
You want to be invisible again!

820
01:19:00,363 --> 01:19:02,563
But the Fr13nds know who you are!

821
01:19:03,419 --> 01:19:04,953
You want a new identity

822
01:19:05,576 --> 01:19:10,442
you want in the witness protection program! that's all you always wanted!

823
01:19:11,616 --> 01:19:14,016
For this I give you MRX, the Fr13nds

824
01:19:15,127 --> 01:19:16,394
It's not that easy!

825
01:19:17,985 --> 01:19:18,985
The Federal Criminal Police Office will be successful

826
01:19:19,962 --> 01:19:21,762
politics and media, pleased

827
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:23,640
You are rehabilitated.

828
01:19:45,719 --> 01:19:46,919
Let's say I agree.

829
01:19:50,230 --> 01:19:51,630
How will you get MRX?

830
01:19:55,658 --> 01:19:56,924
Using a magic trick

831
01:19:58,567 --> 01:20:00,867
There are holes in his story as big as the Death Star!

832
01:20:00,887 --> 01:20:01,887
He's nothing

833
01:20:02,291 --> 01:20:03,291
A no one!

834
01:20:03,979 --> 01:20:06,246
He played with fire and got burned

835
01:20:06,925 --> 01:20:08,658
but he can lead us to MRX!

836
01:20:08,930 --> 01:20:11,263
If we have him we will also get the Fr13nds!

837
01:20:11,273 --> 01:20:12,273
You're suspended!

838
01:20:15,188 --> 01:20:18,854
The promise of the witness protection program must end.

839
01:20:20,177 --> 01:20:21,510
I need you for this!

840
01:20:26,243 --> 01:20:28,443
How should work this magic trick?

841
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:31,617
We will attack MRX's weakest point

842
01:20:33,391 --> 01:20:34,391
his pride!

843
01:22:45,804 --> 01:22:46,804
We got him!

844
01:22:49,208 --> 01:22:50,608
What's his real name?

845
01:22:52,324 --> 01:22:53,324
19 years old

846
01:22:53,985 --> 01:22:54,985
from New York

847
01:22:55,668 --> 01:22:57,668
You should be the last one too

848
01:22:58,065 --> 01:22:59,665
so that you're not alone

849
01:23:00,171 --> 01:23:01,571
That's from Superman!

850
01:23:03,968 --> 01:23:06,101
In a few hours you're a freeman!

851
01:23:07,241 --> 01:23:08,441
New name, new city

852
01:23:29,102 --> 01:23:32,702
There are holes in his story as big as the Death Star!

853
01:24:44,148 --> 01:24:47,681
I'd like to ask you some questions.

854
01:24:53,613 --> 01:24:55,213
Do you know this person?

855
01:24:56,051 --> 01:24:57,051
No.

856
01:24:58,662 --> 01:25:00,995
He said you were in the same class.

857
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:04,790
The freak!

858
01:25:07,156 --> 01:25:08,156
Have you seen Benjamin lately?

859
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:10,330
No.

860
01:25:12,735 --> 01:25:13,735
Excuse me.

861
01:25:13,887 --> 01:25:15,353
What's this all about?

862
01:25:15,372 --> 01:25:17,905
Benjamin is under the BKA's attention.

863
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:21,197
He declared that in the last months you met often

864
01:25:21,328 --> 01:25:22,328
We did what?

865
01:25:24,514 --> 01:25:25,981
He's completely crazy!

866
01:25:28,029 --> 01:25:30,295
I'd never like to meet such a guy!

867
01:25:37,193 --> 01:25:39,393
Thank you for having time for me!

868
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:40,577
It's about Engel

869
01:25:41,072 --> 01:25:42,572
Or better said "your angel"

870
01:25:42,614 --> 01:25:43,414
You know him?

871
01:25:43,429 --> 01:25:44,429
Since he was young.

872
01:25:46,269 --> 01:25:47,702
I have curated his mother.

873
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:48,800
What can you tell me about him?

874
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:50,974
He's uncommunicative

875
01:25:51,404 --> 01:25:52,404
outsider

876
01:25:53,312 --> 01:25:54,912
No wonders in his story.

877
01:25:55,142 --> 01:25:57,009
His mother took her own life

878
01:25:57,337 --> 01:26:00,404
Benjamin has grown up in unclear circumstances

879
01:26:00,914 --> 01:26:03,181
His mother had an identity problem

880
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:04,740
Schizophrenia?

881
01:26:05,168 --> 01:26:07,101
Multiple personality disorder

882
01:26:07,565 --> 01:26:11,498
She had multiple personalities thinking they're all herself

883
01:26:12,001 --> 01:26:14,067
The medication kept her at bay.

884
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:17,060
In the end she couldn't endure anymore.

885
01:26:17,405 --> 01:26:18,505
Is it inheritable?

886
01:26:18,602 --> 01:26:19,602
Possible.

887
01:26:19,944 --> 01:26:21,344
What is it caused by?

888
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:25,544
It can be caused by a predisposition to other substances

889
01:26:25,891 --> 01:26:29,225
Some medicines can make the symptoms even stronger

890
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:31,420
There are several triggers.

891
01:26:31,463 --> 01:26:32,463
Ritalin?

892
01:26:34,217 --> 01:26:35,750
Ritalin is one of them.

893
01:26:38,119 --> 01:26:39,719
But what it's all about?

894
01:26:40,873 --> 01:26:43,273
Is everything alright with Benjamin?

895
01:27:05,246 --> 01:27:07,079
The laboratory results are here!

896
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:08,090
Let me guess! The bullets are from the 2nd World War!

897
01:27:09,094 --> 01:27:10,094
Yes.

898
01:27:16,171 --> 01:27:17,971
How did you get this wound?

899
01:27:18,127 --> 01:27:19,327
what did hurt you?

900
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:21,764
Why were the car keys at you?

901
01:27:22,023 --> 01:27:25,089
It is supposed that Stefan has driven the car!

902
01:27:25,147 --> 01:27:27,480
What did you tell me about Paul? about his mother?

903
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:28,542
She died when he was young

904
01:27:29,274 --> 01:27:30,274
That's you!

905
01:27:32,629 --> 01:27:33,696
They're all you!

906
01:27:34,397 --> 01:27:36,930
No. They're dead!

907
01:27:37,626 --> 01:27:40,159
There are no dead bodies! No evidence!

908
01:27:40,543 --> 01:27:42,343
In any damn hotel in Hague!

909
01:27:47,837 --> 01:27:49,837
What you saw in the hotel room

910
01:28:05,962 --> 01:28:06,962
doesn't exist!

911
01:28:09,688 --> 01:28:12,155
You made them up in your imagination!

912
01:28:14,869 --> 01:28:16,469
CLAY - that's you alone!

913
01:28:20,359 --> 01:28:21,359
You are Max

914
01:28:23,577 --> 01:28:25,844
What? Did you think that I live here?

915
01:28:26,133 --> 01:28:27,133
You are Stefan!

916
01:28:30,182 --> 01:28:31,182
You are Paul!

917
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:37,286
Every action, it was you!

918
01:28:37,988 --> 01:28:38,988
Alone!

919
01:28:39,187 --> 01:28:41,020
I don't even know one half of the people!

920
01:28:41,062 --> 01:28:42,062
All shit suckers!

921
01:28:42,278 --> 01:28:43,278
We need a name!

922
01:28:43,693 --> 01:28:45,560
We must become a brand! We must become famous!

923
01:28:45,659 --> 01:28:47,559
All what attention generates is counterproductive

924
01:28:48,041 --> 01:28:49,408
We're staying off the radar!

925
01:28:49,488 --> 01:28:51,588
Nothing off the radar! Brand is awesome!

926
01:28:52,575 --> 01:28:54,442
Like Anonymous or Lizardsec!

927
01:28:56,379 --> 01:28:57,379
Like MRX!

928
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,600
fucking nail!

929
01:29:10,322 --> 01:29:11,655
I'm not like my mom!

930
01:29:22,699 --> 01:29:23,699
I know who I am

931
01:29:28,401 --> 01:29:30,334
That means that our agreement

932
01:29:32,133 --> 01:29:35,533
disqualifies you for the witness protection program

933
01:29:36,508 --> 01:29:38,308
No! You said we have a deal

934
01:29:38,654 --> 01:29:39,654
a caution!

935
01:29:39,846 --> 01:29:41,979
I get the witness protection program, that's what you said!

936
01:29:42,077 --> 01:29:43,077
I'm sorry!

937
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:44,894
They killed Krypton

938
01:29:45,635 --> 01:29:47,768
I betrayed MRX. They'll find me!

939
01:29:47,905 --> 01:29:49,105
Do you understand?

940
01:29:49,357 --> 01:29:51,424
We had a deal! I get the witness protection program!

941
01:29:51,473 --> 01:29:52,473
That's what you promised me!

942
01:29:53,781 --> 01:29:54,781
I'm sorry.

943
01:29:55,533 --> 01:29:56,533
You're sick!

944
01:29:57,109 --> 01:29:58,443
I'm not like my mom!

945
01:30:13,977 --> 01:30:14,977
I'm sorry!

946
01:30:20,627 --> 01:30:23,961
The Fr13nds will kill me like they killed Krypton!

947
01:30:25,425 --> 01:30:27,691
I want witness protection program!

948
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:29,367
You promised me!

949
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:44,563
Congrats!

950
01:30:51,239 --> 01:30:54,272
The collaboration between the Europol and BKA
 (Federal Criminal Police Office)

951
01:30:54,286 --> 01:30:56,686
has been from the start a composite of efficiency, professionality and certain

952
01:30:57,758 --> 01:31:00,291
Responsible for this is Hanne Lindberg

953
01:31:00,755 --> 01:31:03,821
an exceptional fighter against the cyber mafia

954
01:31:04,327 --> 01:31:06,860
The Internet is not a legal black hole

955
01:31:07,190 --> 01:31:08,990
its doors aren't invisible!

956
01:31:09,775 --> 01:31:11,175
Anyone can be traced.

957
01:31:13,285 --> 01:31:15,885
I asked them to bring you to the court.

958
01:31:44,634 --> 01:31:46,368
I'm sorry for hacking you!

959
01:31:48,548 --> 01:31:49,548
It wasn't fair

960
01:32:11,962 --> 01:32:15,495
The witness protection program is literally a program

961
01:32:19,239 --> 01:32:20,439
You have 5 minutes

962
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:32,729
<i>What will you tell them?</i>

963
01:32:33,097 --> 01:32:35,664
<i>That you're on the way to the courthouse</i>

964
01:32:35,722 --> 01:32:36,422
<i>Won't you be fired again?</i>

965
01:32:38,331 --> 01:32:41,931
<i>They wanted MRX, the Fr13nds. You're a nobody to them!</i>

966
01:32:43,506 --> 01:32:45,173
<i>You're invisible to them!</i>

967
01:32:47,392 --> 01:32:50,059
Promise me that you're done with hacking

968
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:52,250
I promise!

969
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:57,284
No magic tricks anymore

970
01:33:03,927 --> 01:33:04,927
Wait!

971
01:33:06,129 --> 01:33:07,396
Just one more thing

972
01:33:13,919 --> 01:33:15,719
How do you make this trick?

973
01:33:22,628 --> 01:33:25,695
If you know how's working, it's less deceiving

974
01:33:34,378 --> 01:33:36,578
Everyone sees what they wanna see

975
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:41,810
Take care!

976
01:35:22,740 --> 01:35:25,340
She swallowed it hook, line and sinker.

977
01:35:26,127 --> 01:35:29,193
The all time greatest social engineering trick

978
01:35:29,772 --> 01:35:32,139
Not even the Europol knows now who you are.

979
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:33,159
What name did you pick?

980
01:35:33,347 --> 01:35:34,347
No name

981
01:35:41,181 --> 01:35:42,181
<i>OK. Who am I?</i>

982
01:35:43,543 --> 01:35:44,543
<i>I'm Benjamin.</i>

983
01:35:45,043 --> 01:35:46,043
<i>I'm a hacker.</i>

984
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:47,910
<i>and this is my story.</i>

985
01:35:52,615 --> 01:35:54,015
<i>Hacking is like magic</i>

986
01:35:54,419 --> 01:35:57,085
<i>They're both about deceiving the others.</i>

987
01:36:01,814 --> 01:36:02,847
Where have you been?

988
01:36:02,916 --> 01:36:03,916
They have my computer!

989
01:36:04,304 --> 01:36:05,504
They know who am I, we all gotta get outta here!

990
01:36:05,954 --> 01:36:06,954
What happened?

991
01:36:06,984 --> 01:36:08,051
I was at Europol

992
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:09,767
How did you get in there?

993
01:36:10,042 --> 01:36:13,542
I pretended to be one of the students from a group
it doesn't fuckin' matter!

994
01:36:13,576 --> 01:36:14,576
The task.. was a failure!
They got.. they have all my personal details!

995
01:36:15,259 --> 01:36:17,259
Everything! Do you understand?

996
01:36:17,281 --> 01:36:19,748
We gotta get outta here! Immediately!

997
01:36:23,979 --> 01:36:26,246
Come on! What are you waiting for?

998
01:36:26,579 --> 01:36:27,712
You're one of us!

999
01:36:29,141 --> 01:36:30,541
We don't forsake you!

1000
01:36:34,698 --> 01:36:35,698
Now what?

1001
01:36:45,813 --> 01:36:47,413
No system is unhackable.

1002
01:36:49,088 --> 01:36:54,488
Excluded from the witness protection program
are persons having psychic diseases

1003
01:36:56,594 --> 01:36:57,594
Once again

1004
01:36:59,038 --> 01:37:01,305
Give her very detailed information

1005
01:37:01,665 --> 01:37:04,132
this works only if you trust yourself

1006
01:37:04,658 --> 01:37:07,058
And if she doesn't feel mainpulated!

1007
01:37:10,657 --> 01:37:11,657
You can do it!

1008
01:37:14,145 --> 01:37:15,278
Only this is left

1009
01:37:26,989 --> 01:37:27,989
Ready?

1010
01:37:35,424 --> 01:37:36,757
We're all invisible!

1011
01:37:38,552 --> 01:37:39,886
What if she checked?

1012
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:43,050
Don't worry!

1013
01:37:44,302 --> 01:37:45,369
She has checked.

1014
01:37:46,141 --> 01:37:47,874
But she has what she wants

1015
01:37:50,908 --> 01:37:52,308
No more magic tricks.
