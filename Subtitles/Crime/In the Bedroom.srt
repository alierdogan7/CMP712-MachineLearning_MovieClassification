oh, boy.

57
00:06:10,716 --> 00:06:13,150
you see what happened to this poor fella?

58
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,488
what?

59
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:17,240
well, look. he lost an arm.

60
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,461
see, the trap has nylon nets,
called 'heads'--...

61
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:26,250
two side... side heads
to let the lobster crawl in...

62
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,787
and inside,
what they call a 'bedroom head'

63
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:31,605
to hold the balt
and keeps him from escaping.

64
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:33,276
now, you know the old saying...

65
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:35,811
'two's company,
three's a crowd'?

66
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:37,425
well, it's like that.

67
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:39,881
you, uh, get more than two
of these in a bedroom...

68
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:42,751
and chances are something
like that's going to happen.

69
00:06:42,851 --> 00:06:44,782
that's why frank can't leave these traps...

70
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:46,120
for more than a day.

71
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,271
dad, show him this one.

72
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:51,839
now...

73
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:54,763
the older females,
like this old gal...

74
00:06:54,863 --> 00:06:56,845
they're the most dangerous...

75
00:06:56,945 --> 00:06:59,302
especially when they're growing berries.

76
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:00,303
'berries'?

77
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:01,416
yeah, eggs.

78
00:07:01,516 --> 00:07:02,404
you see?

79
00:07:02,504 --> 00:07:04,840
she can take out two males,
no problem.

80
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,624
that's when you get a lobster you can't sell.

81
00:07:07,724 --> 00:07:10,545
but this fine lady,
she, uh, she has it easy...

82
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:14,385
'cause the state says we have to let her go.

83
00:07:15,585 --> 00:07:17,585
( water splashes )...

84
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:22,253
okay, now...

85
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,260
you think you can handle this?

86
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,261
mm-hmm.

87
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,262
are you sure?

88
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,442
mm-hmm.

89
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:28,796
okay, go ahead.

90
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:30,896
put her in the tank.

91
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:37,838
higher. higher.
- higher.

92
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:39,387
i'll swing you higher.

93
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:40,859
like that?
( ball game playing )...

94
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,860
is that high enough?

95
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
duncan: yep.

96
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:50,436
aah, ruth hates these.

97
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:51,437

98
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,518
i got the wrong kind of buns.

99
00:07:53,618 --> 00:07:56,103
maybe we can borrow hers.

100
00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:57,126
two.

101
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,627
okay, you've had a lot, huh?

102
00:07:58,727 --> 00:07:59,808
here, sweetie.

103
00:07:59,908 --> 00:08:02,944
ah, what i would give
to have back my youth.

104
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:06,632
yeah, well, willis, you never
had that in your youth.

105
00:08:06,732 --> 00:08:08,637

106
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:10,319
sportscaster: tony batista...

107
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:13,421

108
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:15,725
hey, father, you made it.

109
00:08:15,825 --> 00:08:18,129

110
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:20,779

111
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:24,053

114
00:08:26,652 --> 00:08:27,573

115
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,653

yes. thank you.

125
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,697
( water dripping in sink )...

126
00:09:12,797 --> 00:09:16,402
i'm looking forward
to that concert on labor day.

127
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:19,706
the music's so unusual.

128
00:09:19,806 --> 00:09:22,209
it's haunting, really.

129
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:23,892
it is, isn't it?

130
00:09:23,992 --> 00:09:25,992
mmm.

131
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,703

132
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,671

136
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:39,324
oh, i thought about becoming a teacher.

137
00:09:39,424 --> 00:09:41,010
well, why didn't you?

138
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,829
mommy.

139
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:45,013

140
00:09:45,113 --> 00:09:46,535
nothing.

141
00:09:46,635 --> 00:09:47,834

142
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:48,854
yeah.

143
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:49,838

148
00:09:55,273 --> 00:09:57,376
so, mr. strout mentioned you again.

149
00:09:57,476 --> 00:09:58,380
i'll bet he did.

150
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,628
he still talks about you.

151
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:01,347
says you're the best can-packer
he ever had.

152
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:02,683
yeah?

153
00:10:02,783 --> 00:10:04,484
says you looked real cute in that hair net.

154
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:05,734
excuse me, boys. an offering.

155
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:07,053
here, father.

156
00:10:07,153 --> 00:10:08,153
thank you.

157
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:11,093
so, uh, that's what charies senior's doing...

158
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,563
and, uh, becky went
to the hairdressing academy...

159
00:10:14,663 --> 00:10:16,048
after high school.

160
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,365
of course,
after she got married...

161
00:10:18,465 --> 00:10:19,998
she decided she wanted...

162
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:22,752
to stay home with the boys, you know.

163
00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:25,274
she still loves doing hair, though.

164
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,073
where do you go, father?

165
00:10:27,173 --> 00:10:29,044
i just go to supercuts.

166
00:10:29,144 --> 00:10:30,512
wha...?

167
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:33,560
you can't request
the same girl at supercuts.

168
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,780
dad: I tell you...

169
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,549
those boys are having a great time.

170
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:38,582
it was good of you to do this for them.

171
00:10:38,682 --> 00:10:40,618
well, she hasn't brought them before...

172
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:42,124
because she's embarrassed.

173
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,755
she shouldn't be embarrassed.

174
00:10:43,855 --> 00:10:46,093
i wish you hadn't put up that monstrosity.

175
00:10:46,193 --> 00:10:48,429
we're just going to have to take it apart...

176
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:49,431
when they leave.

177
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:50,460
what, the swing?

178
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,596
the swing.

179
00:10:51,696 --> 00:10:53,130
oh, ruth, he's a kid.

180
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,502
what do you expect?

181
00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:56,567
'happy birthday. here's a box.

182
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,574
drag it around for a while.'

183
00:10:58,674 --> 00:11:02,159
he's a kid.
he's like me, he wants it now.

184
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:05,756

226
00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:36,499

maine has crazy laws,
that's all.

236
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:03,629
anyway, he loves her boys.

237
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:06,663
oh, god, you don't think he wants to...?

238
00:13:06,763 --> 00:13:08,670
no, he's not going to marry her.

239
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,201
well, then what's he doing with her?

240
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:12,871
she probably loves him.

241
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:14,174
girls always have.

242
00:13:14,274 --> 00:13:15,841

243
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:18,814
( sighs )...

244
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:20,749
well... he won't listen to me.

245
00:13:20,849 --> 00:13:22,346
i've asked him three times...

246
00:13:22,446 --> 00:13:24,353
to dismantie that swing set.

247
00:13:24,453 --> 00:13:25,551
oh, leave it up.

248
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:27,854
looks like a young coupie lives here.

249
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:30,826
( laughing )...

250
00:13:30,926 --> 00:13:32,795
well, he needs his head in school...

251
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,730
not in her.

252
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,430
so to speak.

253
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,332
( shocked gasp )...

254
00:13:38,432 --> 00:13:40,432
( chuckling ): ow.

255
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:44,334

256
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:47,039
oh... i can be on your side.

257
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:48,443
( chuckling )...

258
00:13:48,543 --> 00:13:49,608

261
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,113
( laughing ): i've got a needle.

262
00:13:53,213 --> 00:13:55,213
you don't need those.

263
00:14:05,494 --> 00:14:07,159
( tone beeps )...

264
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:10,221
mr. and mrs. adamson?

265
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:13,600
okay, you can put your shirt back on now.

266
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,304
yesterday, he was up and around
all afternoon...

267
00:14:18,404 --> 00:14:20,675
but today he tumbled.

268
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:22,341
he's fallen twice.

269
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:25,510
i have all i can do to get him up.

270
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,610
he's weak.

271
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,614
said when he couldn't work no more...

272
00:14:29,714 --> 00:14:31,052
he didn't want to live.

273
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:34,022
so, for a while,
he sat and just mended our nets...

274
00:14:34,122 --> 00:14:35,822
but he can't do that no more.

275
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:37,354
how's your dad, matt?

276
00:14:37,454 --> 00:14:39,091

280
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,736

285
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:03,383

00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:24,880
that's none of your business.

370
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,145
i see-- they're my boys...

371
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:28,763
but they're none of my business.

372
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:31,933
you know what i mean.

373
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:33,922
yeah.

374
00:19:34,022 --> 00:19:35,654
( clearing throat )...

375
00:19:35,754 --> 00:19:37,659
i was thinking about moving back...

376
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,309
here... with you and the boys.

377
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:45,083
what are you talking about?

378
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:46,984
what am i talking about?

379
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:48,683
i'm talking about moving back...

380
00:19:48,783 --> 00:19:50,205
is what i'm talking about.

381
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:51,756
i know what you're thinking.

382
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:53,856
it's different now.

383
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,642
yeah?

384
00:19:55,742 --> 00:19:57,742
yeah.

385
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,694
how's the job?

386
00:19:59,794 --> 00:20:01,567
your father take you
back on at the cannery?

387
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,332
that's funny.

388
00:20:03,432 --> 00:20:05,353
still getting checks,
aren't you?

389
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:09,193
or do i have to call my father's accountant?

390
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:14,507
hey, did you see my new rig out there?

391
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:16,109
it's really nice.

392
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:17,649
it's not exactiy new.

393
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,713
i traded david the truck for it.

394
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:21,669
it's got room for all of us.

395
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:23,894
good grocery-getting car.

396
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:28,594
you want to take a ride?

397
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,529
gee, rich, you don't change.

398
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:34,138
you don't change, do you?

399
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:39,033
change? no.

400
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:41,871
no, i don't change.

401
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:44,139
everything around me changes.

402
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:46,740
you change.

403
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,376
you take my house...

404
00:20:49,476 --> 00:20:52,248
and you take my kids...

405
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:54,269
and you fuck this other guy...

406
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:57,384
but me, i don't change at all.

407
00:20:57,484 --> 00:20:59,484
it's not your house.

408
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,826
oh, really?

409
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,856
no. as far as...
( whispers ): fucking goes...

410
00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:05,408
who was it that answered
the phone the other morning?

411
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:06,510
she was just...

412
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,196
it doesn't matter.
i don't care.

413
00:21:08,296 --> 00:21:10,296
it's not working.

414
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:15,955
nat, i just want a chance.

415
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:18,905
for what?

416
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:19,911
so they can pretend...

417
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:21,660
they have a real father for a few days, and...

418
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,031
i am their real father.

419
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:25,815
i am their father.

420
00:21:25,915 --> 00:21:27,753
no, richard.

421
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,417
you know what defines a father?

422
00:21:29,517 --> 00:21:30,466
it's what he does.

423
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:32,170
not what he promises.

424
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:36,267
it's being a positive,
conslistent presence.

425
00:21:38,113 --> 00:21:40,113
( chuckling )...

426
00:21:42,117 --> 00:21:44,986
a positive,
conslistent presence.

427
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:45,987
wow.

428
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:48,152
what does that mean?

429
00:21:48,252 --> 00:21:50,252
i just don't get it.

430
00:21:50,286 --> 00:21:53,686
but i'm not fucking a college boy, am i?

431
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,348
look... you... uh...

432
00:21:58,448 --> 00:21:59,598
can you just go now?

433
00:21:59,698 --> 00:22:02,002
i don't want you here when they get back.

434
00:22:02,102 --> 00:22:05,006
oh, you wouldn't want that?

435
00:22:05,106 --> 00:22:06,856
no.
- no.

436
00:22:06,956 --> 00:22:09,433
no, you have to leave now.

437
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:15,863
okay.

438
00:22:15,963 --> 00:22:17,819
i'll see you later, richard.

439
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,919
yeah. good-bye, nat.

440
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,972
hey...

441
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,773
you know, i've been ignoring
our difference in age...

442
00:22:43,873 --> 00:22:45,679
but you keep playing with those blocks...

443
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:48,159
i'm going to start to worry.

444
00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:51,383
you're not looking at the house.

445
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:53,483
look.

446
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:01,524
it's not all mine.

447
00:23:01,624 --> 00:23:03,624
it's part mack.

448
00:23:03,693 --> 00:23:06,067
see, the whole idea
of what mack was trying...

449
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:09,470
to achieve was a common area
in the center of the house.

450
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,373
i mean, large open spaces--
they weren't unique to mack...

451
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:14,404
but the idea of separating the family...

452
00:23:14,504 --> 00:23:17,379
so that the parents were on one side...

453
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,943
and the kids are on the other, so...

454
00:23:20,043 --> 00:23:22,180
they'll all spill into the center.

455
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,320
it's brilliant. it's....

456
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:27,551
i'm boring you, aren't i?

457
00:23:27,651 --> 00:23:29,524
no.

458
00:23:29,624 --> 00:23:32,123
mm-mm.

459
00:23:32,223 --> 00:23:34,685
i was just thinking.

460
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:40,535
about what?

461
00:23:40,635 --> 00:23:44,135
about you.

462
00:23:44,235 --> 00:23:46,640
school.

463
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:53,713
what if i wait a year?

464
00:23:55,617 --> 00:23:57,918
frank...

465
00:23:58,018 --> 00:23:59,387
a year is not going to make...

466
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:00,889
no, you can't do that, frank.

467
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:02,019
why not?

468
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:06,022
i've thought a lot about this.

469
00:24:06,122 --> 00:24:08,187
i have, and....

470
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:10,732
no. you...

471
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:12,700
you told me it takes forever...

472
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,168
just to establish yourself.

473
00:24:14,268 --> 00:24:17,413
exactiy. so what's a year in forever?

474
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:25,945
that's twisted logic.

475
00:24:25,947 --> 00:24:28,181
( laughing )...

476
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:30,652
do you know what duncan
said to me today?

477
00:24:30,752 --> 00:24:34,656
oh, you wouldn't be changing
the subject, would you?

478
00:24:34,756 --> 00:24:37,321
he said,
'frank, i don't think jason...

479
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:39,294
really understands girls.'

480
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,824
oh, he didn't.

481
00:24:40,924 --> 00:24:41,993
he did.

482
00:24:42,093 --> 00:24:43,430
( both laughing )...

483
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,557
'understands girls.'

484
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:49,299
well, what'd you say?

485
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:51,137
i didn't know what to say to that.

486
00:24:51,237 --> 00:24:53,641
i said... i said,
'give him time, duncan.

487
00:24:53,741 --> 00:24:56,043
he'll come around.'

488
00:24:56,143 --> 00:25:00,138
if this is how he is now,
then we're in trouble.

489
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:20,735
what is this, action man?

490
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:24,745
yeah. richard gave it
to dunc for his birthday.

491
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:40,364
( women singing balkan folk song )...

492
00:26:02,944 --> 00:26:04,944
very good.

493
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:06,979
okay, it's 7:30.

494
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:08,512
we should stop now.

495
00:26:08,612 --> 00:26:09,545
now remember...

496
00:26:09,645 --> 00:26:10,985
when you sing these words...

497
00:26:11,085 --> 00:26:12,852
the way we feel about the harbor...

498
00:26:12,952 --> 00:26:16,172
is how the balkans felt about the river sava.

499
00:26:16,272 --> 00:26:18,058
and listen to your tapes.

500
00:26:18,158 --> 00:26:20,393
'mollih ta' is still very rough...

501
00:26:20,493 --> 00:26:22,959
and we've got a 40-minute program.

502
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:26,096
to have ready by labor day.

503
00:26:26,196 --> 00:26:28,299
Iabor day.

504
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:29,636
oh, and anna?

505
00:26:29,736 --> 00:26:30,734
yeah, ms. fowler?

506
00:26:30,834 --> 00:26:32,834
next time, duck.

507
00:26:34,643 --> 00:26:36,476
yoo-hoo.

508
00:26:36,576 --> 00:26:38,446
yeah. great.

509
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:40,611
( groaning ): dad...

510
00:26:40,711 --> 00:26:42,949
is that acid?

511
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:45,015
what are you putting in there?

512
00:26:45,115 --> 00:26:46,020
oh, my god.

513
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,201
what happened?

514
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:49,190
matt: come on, frank. hold still.

515
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,287
all right, dad.

516
00:26:50,387 --> 00:26:51,922
this was her husband, wasn't it?

517
00:26:52,022 --> 00:26:54,058
ex. he dropped in.

518
00:26:54,158 --> 00:26:56,092
you going to press charges?

519
00:26:56,192 --> 00:26:57,362
no.

520
00:26:57,462 --> 00:26:59,334
well, what's to stop him
from doing it again?

521
00:26:59,434 --> 00:27:00,335
did you hit him at all?

522
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:01,932
come on, tell me tell me you hit him.

523
00:27:02,032 --> 00:27:02,937
matt.

524
00:27:03,037 --> 00:27:04,172
just so he doesn't do it again.

525
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:05,336
i don't think i touched him.

526
00:27:05,436 --> 00:27:06,341
aah. jesus. dad.

527
00:27:06,441 --> 00:27:08,309
so what are you going to do?

528
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:09,872
take karate.

529
00:27:09,972 --> 00:27:11,643
oh, that is not the problem.

530
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:14,081
mom, you know you like her.

531
00:27:14,181 --> 00:27:16,517
i like a lot of people, frank.

532
00:27:16,617 --> 00:27:18,519
what about the boys,
did they see it?

533
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:20,386
no, they were asleep.

534
00:27:20,486 --> 00:27:23,054
did you leave her alone with him?

535
00:27:23,154 --> 00:27:24,058
he left first.

536
00:27:24,158 --> 00:27:26,158
she was yelling at him.

537
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:27,926
i believe she had a skiilet in her hand.

538
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:30,763
oh, for god's sakes.
did you call the police?

539
00:27:30,863 --> 00:27:31,766
not yet.

540
00:27:31,866 --> 00:27:32,998
you didn't call them?

541
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:34,165
well, i just got in.

542
00:27:34,265 --> 00:27:35,299
where's the phone book?

543
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:37,367
when did i have chance to call the police?

544
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:38,772
no, mom, no, don't call them.

545
00:27:38,872 --> 00:27:40,472
if you call the police,
they'll come over...

546
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:41,639
and scare the kids.
- matt...

547
00:27:41,739 --> 00:27:43,144
we got to call them.

548
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,275
no, we're not calling them.

549
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:45,510
it was a scuffie. that's it.

550
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,812
it wasn't serious.

551
00:27:46,912 --> 00:27:49,480
oh, right, just like the
relationship isn't serious.

552
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,614
oh, ruth.

553
00:27:50,714 --> 00:27:51,951
now is not the time.

554
00:27:52,051 --> 00:27:53,387
well, when is the time...

555
00:27:53,487 --> 00:27:55,390
after he knocks him into a coma?

556
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,790
this is stopping now.

557
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,023
oh, really?

558
00:27:58,123 --> 00:28:00,157
come fall, you're on a piane.

559
00:28:00,257 --> 00:28:02,394
are you taking them with you?

560
00:28:02,494 --> 00:28:03,960
what are the boys going to think...

561
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,146
when you just disappear?

562
00:28:05,246 --> 00:28:06,797
hey, easy, mom.

563
00:28:06,897 --> 00:28:09,703
frank, this is not some
sweetie from vassar...

564
00:28:09,803 --> 00:28:11,673
that you can visit on holidays.

565
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,405
you're not in this alone.

566
00:28:13,505 --> 00:28:16,650
and the sooner you end it,
the better.

567
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:21,280
( quietly ): oh, god...

568
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,616
what are we going to do?

569
00:28:23,716 --> 00:28:26,587
i don't know.

570
00:28:26,687 --> 00:28:30,102
well, you've got to talk to him, matt.

571
00:28:30,202 --> 00:28:31,592
( sighs )...

572
00:28:31,692 --> 00:28:34,595
i don't know.

573
00:28:34,695 --> 00:28:38,095
maybe he's right about scarlng the kids.

574
00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:40,518
why don't we just sleep on it--...

575
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,436
deal with it tomorrow?

576
00:28:42,536 --> 00:28:44,771
are you going to call
the police, or do i have to?

577
00:28:44,871 --> 00:28:46,139
i just told you what i think.

578
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:49,214
if you want to call them,
call them.

579
00:28:53,348 --> 00:28:55,348
( moans )...

580
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:11,529
it's not the first time...

581
00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:13,096
she's played around, you know.

582
00:29:13,196 --> 00:29:15,831
she's not with the guy anymore.

583
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:17,104
no, i mean from before.

584
00:29:17,204 --> 00:29:18,634
what are you talking about?

585
00:29:18,734 --> 00:29:21,373
oh, come on, you've heard
the same things i have.

586
00:29:21,473 --> 00:29:22,641
you seem to forget.

587
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:26,736
i don't take my lunches
in the teachers' lounge.

588
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,984
maybe he still loves her.

589
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:40,473
( seagull calling )...

590
00:29:40,573 --> 00:29:41,676
best part of the cod.

591
00:29:41,776 --> 00:29:43,180
the outsiders,
they won't touch it.

592
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,280
summer fishermen--...

593
00:29:45,282 --> 00:29:47,466
well, they're part-timers like frank here--...

594
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:48,986
get in your hair.

595
00:29:49,086 --> 00:29:51,118
as many as 80 of them now with licenses.

596
00:29:51,218 --> 00:29:53,169
hmm. should've put up a sign:

597
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:56,110
'stay in your own backyard,
or lose your traps.'

598
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,612
see, henry here is just sore...

599
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,013
'cause i catch about
twice as much as he does...

600
00:30:00,113 --> 00:30:01,797
with an old second-hand boudreau.

601
00:30:01,897 --> 00:30:03,317
now, don't you listen to him, son.

602
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:04,819
that boat is fine.

603
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:06,919
she was my first.

604
00:30:08,423 --> 00:30:10,791
i kind of miss her, sometimes.

605
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:13,339
and that truck you're driving.

606
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:15,729
when are you headed back
to school, frank?

607
00:30:15,829 --> 00:30:16,911
hmm?

608
00:30:17,011 --> 00:30:19,512
( laughing )...

609
00:30:19,612 --> 00:30:23,537
( laughing continues )...

610
00:30:32,046 --> 00:30:34,046
hi, dr. fowler.

611
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:35,483
how you doing, jason?

612
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,583
good.

613
00:30:46,794 --> 00:30:48,994
what'd you pull?

614
00:30:49,094 --> 00:30:51,544
not too bad.

615
00:30:51,644 --> 00:30:54,434
about 40 pounds.

616
00:30:54,534 --> 00:30:57,438
i haven't caught sight of you in days.

617
00:30:57,538 --> 00:30:58,984
you know where to find me.

618
00:30:59,084 --> 00:31:01,841
when are you coming home?

619
00:31:01,941 --> 00:31:03,941
has it come to this?

620
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,262
come to what?

621
00:31:06,362 --> 00:31:10,215
you having to run errands for mom.

622
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,302
i'm thinking of building
a coupie hundred more traps--...

623
00:31:16,402 --> 00:31:19,327
see if i can do better than break even.

624
00:31:19,427 --> 00:31:21,109
take you more than two years...

625
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:23,530
to get a iicense to fish off-season.

626
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,078
right. uniess henry takes me on
as his sternman.

627
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:28,178
you think he'd do that?

628
00:31:28,202 --> 00:31:29,648
maybe.

629
00:31:29,748 --> 00:31:32,972
it's as good a life as any.

630
00:31:33,072 --> 00:31:35,476
it was good enough for your father...

631
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:40,526
and sometimes things
just skip a generation.

632
00:31:40,626 --> 00:31:44,210
you don't think...

633
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,401
you don't think you might
need something more?

634
00:31:47,501 --> 00:31:49,374
why...

635
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:52,777
so i can have an ivy league
education like you, and...?

636
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,443
christ, if it's so great...

637
00:31:55,543 --> 00:31:57,746
how come you sneak
out of the office every day...

638
00:31:57,846 --> 00:31:59,846
to come down here?

639
00:31:59,912 --> 00:32:04,620
i like spending time with my son.

640
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,197
uh-huh.

641
00:32:20,321 --> 00:32:22,881
i don't know, dad.

642
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,128
it's just-- i don't know.

643
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:35,052
she's a wonderful girl...

644
00:32:35,152 --> 00:32:38,867
and that's what i see.

645
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:45,808
henry: hey, frank.

646
00:32:45,908 --> 00:32:47,393
how long you gonna be parked there?

647
00:32:47,493 --> 00:32:49,366
i'd like to unioad.

648
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:50,913

649
00:32:51,013 --> 00:32:53,385
yeah, sure.

650
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:04,910
you can't hypnotize...

651
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:07,935
the cards into changing, matt.

652
00:33:08,035 --> 00:33:11,669
for chrissake, bet,
or you know carl's gonna start.

653
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:13,837
'the beggar's dog and the widow's cat...

654
00:33:13,937 --> 00:33:16,074
'feed them and thou wilt grow fat.

655
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:18,844
'the gnat sings his summer's song.

656
00:33:18,944 --> 00:33:21,366
'poison gets from slander's tongue.

657
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:22,929
'the poison of the snake and newt...

658
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:26,752
'is the sweat of envy's foot.

659
00:33:26,852 --> 00:33:30,224
the poison of the honey bee
is the artist's jealousy.'

660
00:33:30,324 --> 00:33:33,559
all right, carl. two bucks.

661
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:36,362
i'll tell you, man, you got
to get out of this blake thing.

662
00:33:36,462 --> 00:33:38,096
you're in a rut.

663
00:33:38,196 --> 00:33:39,584
don't get him started,
matt.

664
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,351
whenever i do my own stuff,
you guys bitch and moan.

665
00:33:42,451 --> 00:33:43,450
that's not true.

666
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,455
we love your stuff.

667
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:45,754
it's great stuff, right?

668
00:33:45,854 --> 00:33:47,303
( laughter )...

669
00:33:47,403 --> 00:33:48,607

674
00:33:59,484 --> 00:34:00,787

675
00:34:00,887 --> 00:34:02,887

676
00:34:02,952 --> 00:34:05,722

688
00:35:08,851 --> 00:35:10,851

721
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:50,758

722
00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:52,023
he didn't hit you.

723
00:36:52,123 --> 00:36:53,623

i'm sure.

918
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:56,950
you know where they'll move him,
once he's sentenced?

919
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,050
got any, uh, tabasco?

920
00:49:01,888 --> 00:49:04,723
hey, anita. tabasco.

921
00:49:04,823 --> 00:49:07,227
hey.

922
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,558
aw, shit.

923
00:49:27,614 --> 00:49:29,077
next weekend, matt...

924
00:49:29,177 --> 00:49:31,349
we really want you to come up to the camp.

925
00:49:31,449 --> 00:49:33,320
katie's insisting.

926
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,952
not to pressure you or anything,
but if you don't come...

927
00:49:36,052 --> 00:49:38,256
she's going to invite her
sister and that idiot...

928
00:49:38,356 --> 00:49:40,558
and i'm going to wind up
insulting him again.

929
00:49:40,658 --> 00:49:44,143
the future of my family is in your hands.

930
00:49:44,158 --> 00:49:46,656
uh, let me ask ruth.

931
00:49:48,702 --> 00:49:50,733
woman ( on tv):
so the combination of spices...

932
00:49:50,833 --> 00:49:53,140
is very southern, and i'll
tell you what makes it southern.

933
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,338
there are corlander seeds,
which i'm going to put...

934
00:49:55,438 --> 00:49:56,506
( door opening )...

935
00:49:56,606 --> 00:49:58,478
in this cast iron skillet...

936
00:49:58,578 --> 00:49:59,980
hi.

937
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,448
how was your day?

938
00:50:01,548 --> 00:50:04,114
fine.

939
00:50:04,214 --> 00:50:05,281
i had lunch with willis.

940
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:06,916
...about two tablespoons there...

941
00:50:07,016 --> 00:50:08,450
it was really great to see him.

942
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:12,088
my day was fine, too, thanks.

943
00:50:12,188 --> 00:50:13,323
sorry, did you say something?

944
00:50:13,423 --> 00:50:15,227
you don't want to use too much of that.

945
00:50:15,327 --> 00:50:16,392
just a little bit.

946
00:50:16,492 --> 00:50:17,864
no.

947
00:50:17,964 --> 00:50:20,895
...a quarter teaspoon.

948
00:50:20,995 --> 00:50:21,997
uh...

949
00:50:22,097 --> 00:50:24,471
katie and willis invited us...

950
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:27,271
up to the camp for the weekend.

951
00:50:27,371 --> 00:50:28,640
i said i'd check with you...

952
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,644
in case we were doing something else.

953
00:50:30,744 --> 00:50:33,613
once it starts roasting,
it doesn't take very long...

954
00:50:33,713 --> 00:50:35,947
that sounds fine.

955
00:50:36,047 --> 00:50:39,751
we, uh, we don't have to go.

956
00:50:39,851 --> 00:50:42,385
you don't want to?

957
00:50:42,485 --> 00:50:43,918
yeah, i want to.

958
00:50:44,018 --> 00:50:45,656
then tell them yes.

959
00:50:45,756 --> 00:50:48,960
well, i thought you might be, uh...

960
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,725
busy getting the girls ready.

961
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:55,666
no.

962
00:50:55,766 --> 00:50:58,911
so i let it cool off very slightly...

963
00:51:01,174 --> 00:51:02,671
okay.

964
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:05,576
put all the spices in one bowl...

965
00:51:10,684 --> 00:51:15,869
when it's slightly cooled off,
in it goes, into the grinder...

966
00:51:18,024 --> 00:51:19,690
all right,
the next matter is the matter...

967
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:21,290
of state of maine v.
richard strout.

968
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:23,263
the record should reflect...

969
00:51:23,363 --> 00:51:26,148
that the defendant has been incarcerated...

970
00:51:26,248 --> 00:51:28,331
in the knox county jail without ball...

971
00:51:28,431 --> 00:51:30,033
since the 1 7th of july.

972
00:51:30,133 --> 00:51:33,039
we're here for a ball hearing.

973
00:51:33,139 --> 00:51:34,338
mr. davis, given the fact...

974
00:51:34,438 --> 00:51:36,438
that we have a very
crowded trial calendar...

975
00:51:36,538 --> 00:51:39,179
i'm going to suggest
that we do both the ball hearing...

976
00:51:39,279 --> 00:51:41,377
and probable cause hearing today at 2:00.

977
00:51:41,477 --> 00:51:43,912
so unless I hear any objection
to the contrary.

978
00:51:44,012 --> 00:51:45,447
I'd like to set it for 2:00...

979
00:51:45,547 --> 00:51:50,392
and we will take testimony
of your witnesses at that time.

980
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:53,118
natalie: i...

981
00:51:53,226 --> 00:51:55,226
i closed the door.

982
00:52:00,267 --> 00:52:02,432
i...

983
00:52:02,532 --> 00:52:04,404
i walked...

984
00:52:04,504 --> 00:52:08,520
through my room.

985
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,808
i heard some yelling.

986
00:52:10,908 --> 00:52:12,278
i heard yelling.

987
00:52:12,378 --> 00:52:14,378
heard yelling.

988
00:52:15,448 --> 00:52:17,448
i got to the stairs...

989
00:52:24,658 --> 00:52:26,526
( sighs )...

990
00:52:26,626 --> 00:52:29,226
and then i heard...

991
00:52:29,326 --> 00:52:31,730
i heard the shot.

992
00:52:35,202 --> 00:52:36,232
richard...

993
00:52:36,332 --> 00:52:37,400
lawyer: i-i'm sorry.

994
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,449
( sobbing ): richard...

995
00:52:38,549 --> 00:52:41,874
could we go back just a minute?

996
00:52:41,974 --> 00:52:45,459
mrs. strout, you said you heard the shot.

997
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,462
yes.

998
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,883
you heard the shot?

999
00:52:49,983 --> 00:52:50,901
did you actually witness...

1000
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,564
the accident?
- objection.

1001
00:52:52,664 --> 00:52:53,817
your honor, there are no grounds...

1002
00:52:53,917 --> 00:52:55,122
to indicate this was an accident.

1003
00:52:55,222 --> 00:52:56,369
judge: sustained.

1004
00:52:56,469 --> 00:52:59,623
strike the word 'accident' from the record.

1005
00:52:59,723 --> 00:53:03,861
rephrase your question,
ms. keyes.

1006
00:53:03,961 --> 00:53:07,733
mrs. strout, in the police report you stated...

1007
00:53:07,833 --> 00:53:12,636
that you had witnessed
the firearm discharge.

1008
00:53:14,741 --> 00:53:17,971
did you witness the firearm discharge?

1009
00:53:26,987 --> 00:53:28,987
( gasping )...

1010
00:53:35,528 --> 00:53:36,929
i thought you said there would be...

1011
00:53:37,029 --> 00:53:39,866
a jury trial sometime in october.

1012
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,497
if he was incarcerated...

1013
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:43,615
the judge would have set
an october court date...

1014
00:53:43,715 --> 00:53:45,003
basically to save the county...

1015
00:53:45,103 --> 00:53:47,805
the cost of housing
and feeding him as an inmate.

1016
00:53:47,905 --> 00:53:52,357
but, with bail, unfortunately,
the court date is always later.

1017
00:53:52,457 --> 00:53:54,729
you mean there's nothing
we can do about this?

1018
00:53:54,829 --> 00:53:56,265
you let that bastard just walk out...

1019
00:53:56,365 --> 00:53:58,414
and we're supposed to just sit here?

1020
00:53:58,514 --> 00:54:02,220
we can't appeal bail.
it's just not set up that way.

1021
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:07,441
the state's ball code is to
ensure future court appearances.

1022
00:54:07,541 --> 00:54:09,642
now, in this case,
strout's family was prepared...

1023
00:54:09,742 --> 00:54:11,946
to put up a substantial
amount of property as ball.

1024
00:54:12,046 --> 00:54:15,871
that, along with his ties to the community...

1025
00:54:15,934 --> 00:54:17,736
made it very hard for us
to convince a judge...

1026
00:54:17,836 --> 00:54:20,140
that there was a serious risk of flight.

1027
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,253
now, you can file...

1028
00:54:21,353 --> 00:54:22,455
a civil suit.

1029
00:54:22,555 --> 00:54:24,110
i recommend it.

1030
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,842
but not now.

1031
00:54:25,942 --> 00:54:27,391
wait until after the criminal trial.

1032
00:54:27,491 --> 00:54:29,491
and when will that be?

1033
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,664
well, honestly...

1034
00:54:31,764 --> 00:54:33,686
could be anywhere from...

1035
00:54:33,786 --> 00:54:35,120
12 to 18 months.

1036
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,056
oh, my god.

1037
00:54:37,156 --> 00:54:42,086
you're confident you can put him
away for good then, right?

1038
00:54:50,937 --> 00:54:54,418
the things she said in there...

1039
00:54:54,518 --> 00:54:57,190
what's the damage?

1040
00:54:57,290 --> 00:55:00,563
the way this is going...

1041
00:55:00,663 --> 00:55:03,043
potentially... manslaughter.

1042
00:55:04,918 --> 00:55:07,432
jesus christ.

1043
00:55:07,532 --> 00:55:10,738
he killed our son.

1044
00:55:10,838 --> 00:55:13,760
he-- it was no accident.

1045
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:17,612
ruth, ruth, ruth... ruth.

1046
00:55:17,712 --> 00:55:22,450
uh... how long will he be sent away for?

1047
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:24,015
well, that's hard to say, really.

1048
00:55:24,115 --> 00:55:26,389
anywhere from five to 15 years.

1049
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,971
but we're confident that
we'll get the maximum.

1050
00:55:29,071 --> 00:55:31,294
- so even with good behavior
- five years?.

1051
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:33,526
- he'll do ten full years.
- ten years?.

1052
00:55:33,626 --> 00:55:35,836
are you out of your mind?.

1053
00:55:37,851 --> 00:55:40,584
dr. fowler, mrs. fowler,
i'm sorry.

1054
00:55:40,684 --> 00:55:42,684
i understand.

1055
00:55:42,688 --> 00:55:44,953
no, you don't.

1056
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,510
( whispering ): no, you don't.

1057
00:55:58,671 --> 00:56:01,162
( car engine droning )...

1058
00:56:23,196 --> 00:56:25,648
( engine thrumming )...

1059
00:56:25,748 --> 00:56:27,748
( bird chirping )...

1060
00:56:35,842 --> 00:56:37,066
reporter: dr. fowler, what will...

1061
00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:37,944
your next step be?

1062
00:56:38,044 --> 00:56:40,024
matt: uh, i don't know...

1063
00:56:40,124 --> 00:56:41,761
reporter 2: dr. fowler, how do you feel...

1064
00:56:41,861 --> 00:56:42,849
about the result today?

1065
00:56:42,949 --> 00:56:43,918
matt: well, that's, that's...

1066
00:56:44,018 --> 00:56:44,517
something...

1067
00:56:44,617 --> 00:56:45,579
( tableware clattering )...

1068
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:47,452
( birds chirping )...

1069
00:56:47,552 --> 00:56:49,154
reporter 3: dr. fowler, have you had any...

1070
00:56:49,254 --> 00:56:50,256
contact with mrs. strout?

1071
00:56:50,356 --> 00:56:51,690
matt: no.

1072
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:53,642
reporter 4: how's mrs. fowler handling this?

1073
00:56:53,742 --> 00:56:56,037
( tableware clattering )...

1074
00:56:58,131 --> 00:56:59,895
reporter 5: do you feel that justice...

1075
00:56:59,995 --> 00:57:01,234
has been served today?

1076
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,815
matt: i think our legal system...

1077
00:57:02,915 --> 00:57:03,870
will determine that.

1078
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:06,254
( camera shutter clicking )...

1079
00:57:06,354 --> 00:57:08,173
reporters: dr. fowler... dr. fowler...

1080
00:57:08,273 --> 00:57:09,192
matt: leave now.

1081
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,059
reporter 2: any more legal action planned?

1082
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:12,877
( door slams )
- can you believe this?

1083
00:57:12,977 --> 00:57:16,512
i ask those idiots to leave,
and no one budges, not one.

1084
00:57:16,612 --> 00:57:18,816
what are we supposed to do,
make them sandwiches?

1085
00:57:18,916 --> 00:57:20,820
what are you asking for?

1086
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,018
what?

1087
00:57:22,118 --> 00:57:25,943
if you want them to leave,
tell them to leave.

1088
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,097
okay, i'll tell them to leave.

1089
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,197
good.

1090
00:57:42,408 --> 00:57:44,358
woman ( on tv ): and they never come up...

1091
00:57:44,458 --> 00:57:45,178
to the standard.

1092
00:57:45,278 --> 00:57:48,045
and so they're always and
forever disappointed. always.

1093
00:57:48,145 --> 00:57:49,498
they're never doing enough...

1094
00:57:49,598 --> 00:57:50,916
they're never working hard enough.

1095
00:57:51,016 --> 00:57:52,351
they never behaved right enough.

1096
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:53,982
they were never a good enough father...

1097
00:57:54,082 --> 00:57:55,516
never a good enough husband.

1098
00:57:55,616 --> 00:57:57,619
and not only can they not
please themselves...

1099
00:57:57,719 --> 00:57:59,125
sad to say, most of the time...

1100
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:02,200
nobody else can please them either.

1101
00:58:15,775 --> 00:58:18,441
you slept late... for you.

1102
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:22,381
yeah, i took one of your pills.

1103
00:58:22,481 --> 00:58:24,481
you never do that.

1104
00:58:24,579 --> 00:58:26,579
mmm...

1105
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:31,155
well, there it is in black and white.

1106
00:58:31,255 --> 00:58:33,159
you should read some
of the things he says.

1107
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:35,259
it's unbelievable.

1108
00:58:36,663 --> 00:58:38,663
yeah.

1109
00:58:42,735 --> 00:58:46,166
well, i, uh, i better be going.

1110
00:58:46,266 --> 00:58:48,266

1111
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:52,645
oh, there's some stuff i have
to catch up on at the office.

1112
00:58:52,745 --> 00:58:54,745
i won't be long.

1113
00:58:54,775 --> 00:58:56,775
( kissing )...

1114
00:59:01,521 --> 00:59:04,149
( door opens and shuts )...

1115
00:59:09,829 --> 00:59:11,376
( cash register keys beeping )...

1116
00:59:11,476 --> 00:59:13,476
( receipt printing )...

1117
00:59:14,834 --> 00:59:16,834
thank you.

1118
00:59:17,503 --> 00:59:19,628
do you want your receipt?

1119
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,644
matt: natalie.

1120
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,362
hi.

1121
00:59:29,462 --> 00:59:31,462
( whispering ): hi.

1122
00:59:33,052 --> 00:59:35,533
i, uh, hope i'm not disturbing you.

1123
00:59:35,633 --> 00:59:38,074
uh-uh.

1124
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:41,126
not at all.

1125
00:59:41,261 --> 00:59:43,981
could you break a fifty, please?

1126
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,664
excuse me.

1127
00:59:50,536 --> 00:59:52,576
( register whirring )...

1128
00:59:54,207 --> 00:59:56,207
( counting bills )...

1129
00:59:56,209 --> 00:59:57,593
woman: thank you, dear.

1130
00:59:57,693 --> 01:00:00,427
could i possibly have another bag?

1131
01:00:00,527 --> 01:00:02,527
oh, sure.

1132
01:00:09,789 --> 01:00:11,038
( doorbell tinkling )...

1133
01:00:11,138 --> 01:00:12,339
( screen door slams )...

1134
01:00:12,439 --> 01:00:14,277
yeah, well, i was just, uh...

1135
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:19,012
just wondering how you're doing.

1136
01:00:19,112 --> 01:00:22,090
i tried to reach you.

1137
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:24,069
oh.

1138
01:00:24,169 --> 01:00:26,555
um...

1139
01:00:26,655 --> 01:00:28,655
we're at my mom's now.

1140
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,096
i wanted to call you.

1141
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:35,341
that's... that's okay.

1142
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:41,382
dr. fowler, i...

1143
01:00:41,482 --> 01:00:43,535

1144
01:00:43,635 --> 01:00:46,649
yeah, i-i-i-i know.

1145
01:00:53,366 --> 01:00:55,425
i didn't lie.

1146
01:00:57,470 --> 01:01:00,153
i didn't lie the first time.

1147
01:01:00,253 --> 01:01:02,253
it was...

1148
01:01:04,977 --> 01:01:06,977
it's how it came out.

1149
01:01:08,147 --> 01:01:09,194
( doorbell tinkling )...

1150
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:11,294
( footsteps )...

1151
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,086
( door slams )...

1152
01:01:13,186 --> 01:01:15,311
( quietly ): mrs. fowler?

1153
01:01:16,489 --> 01:01:18,255
no, uh...

1154
01:01:18,355 --> 01:01:20,063
man: can i get a pack...

1155
01:01:20,163 --> 01:01:22,163
of marlboro reds?

1156
01:01:30,903 --> 01:01:34,919
( register alarm beeping )...

1157
01:01:35,019 --> 01:01:36,172
( banging register )...

1158
01:01:36,272 --> 01:01:38,403
( receipt printing )...

1159
01:01:42,715 --> 01:01:44,117
( doorbell tinkling )...

1160
01:01:44,217 --> 01:01:46,248
( door slams )...

1161
01:01:46,348 --> 01:01:49,435
how are the boys?

1162
01:01:49,535 --> 01:01:51,535
they all right?

1163
01:01:53,559 --> 01:01:55,559
( whispering ): yeah.

1164
01:01:58,364 --> 01:02:01,548
uh... i got to go.

1165
01:02:01,648 --> 01:02:03,648
i'll see you.

1166
01:02:05,938 --> 01:02:08,031
( door slams )...

1167
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:18,846
so how much of this is yours?

1168
01:02:18,946 --> 01:02:20,116
( chuckling )...

1169
01:02:20,216 --> 01:02:21,716
you ask me that every time.

1170
01:02:21,816 --> 01:02:24,589
you know the cove,
the other side of the cabin?

1171
01:02:24,689 --> 01:02:25,591
yeah.

1172
01:02:25,691 --> 01:02:27,824
all the way to the other shoreline.

1173
01:02:27,924 --> 01:02:30,695
aimost 350 acres.

1174
01:02:30,795 --> 01:02:32,395
know what it went for when i bought it?

1175
01:02:32,495 --> 01:02:33,427
no.

1176
01:02:33,527 --> 01:02:34,799
you don't want to know.

1177
01:02:34,899 --> 01:02:36,899
( both chuckling )...

1178
01:02:43,042 --> 01:02:45,641
oh, and that's little charles
down at the pool.

1179
01:02:45,741 --> 01:02:48,845
he figured out how to
get down to the pool...

1180
01:02:48,945 --> 01:02:51,817
on the elevator, by himself.

1181
01:02:51,917 --> 01:02:53,482
oh, he must've been very proud.

1182
01:02:53,582 --> 01:02:55,285
oh, yeah.

1183
01:02:55,385 --> 01:02:57,289
oh, and that's shannon
waiting in line for--...

1184
01:02:57,389 --> 01:02:59,724
oh, my god-- that roller coaster.

1185
01:02:59,824 --> 01:03:01,558
you know the one?
oh, my god.

1186
01:03:01,658 --> 01:03:03,090
were the lines very long?

1187
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:05,828
uh, yeah, yeah, sometimes.

1188
01:03:05,928 --> 01:03:07,113
60 minutes and upwards.

1189
01:03:07,213 --> 01:03:09,433
unless, of course, you got...

1190
01:03:09,533 --> 01:03:11,533
the, um...

1191
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:13,599
uh, fastpass.

1192
01:03:13,606 --> 01:03:14,670
( laughs gently )...

1193
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:16,107
what's the fastpass?

1194
01:03:16,207 --> 01:03:19,410
uh, well, you know, you got all
these different kingdoms there...

1195
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:21,510
and, uh...

1196
01:03:21,514 --> 01:03:23,782
so you take this... fastpass.

1197
01:03:23,882 --> 01:03:25,414
it's kind of a laminated card.

1198
01:03:25,514 --> 01:03:26,947
you just put into a machine...

1199
01:03:27,047 --> 01:03:28,786
and it tells you when to come back...

1200
01:03:28,886 --> 01:03:31,054
so, you know, you don't have to wait in line.

1201
01:03:31,154 --> 01:03:33,137
you just go right in and...

1202
01:03:33,237 --> 01:03:34,593
you guys ever go to florida?

1203
01:03:34,693 --> 01:03:37,629
no.

1204
01:03:40,132 --> 01:03:43,362
how many grandchildren
do you have now?

1205
01:03:43,399 --> 01:03:44,466
um...

1206
01:03:44,566 --> 01:03:47,704
( laughs )...

1207
01:03:47,804 --> 01:03:51,508
uh, well, all right, there's
little charles and shannon...

1208
01:03:51,608 --> 01:03:54,277
um, the three older ones...

1209
01:03:54,377 --> 01:03:56,115
and the babies.

1210
01:03:56,215 --> 01:03:58,348
( quietly ): that's charles, shannon,

1211
01:03:58,448 --> 01:03:59,352
mary, george...

1212
01:03:59,452 --> 01:04:01,483
wendy, lee...
so, what, that's 11.

1213
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:03,253
( sighs )...

1214
01:04:03,353 --> 01:04:05,921
it must be wonderful.

1215
01:04:06,021 --> 01:04:07,106
willis always says...

1216
01:04:07,206 --> 01:04:10,946
'i guess there's no danger of us dying off.'

1217
01:04:25,711 --> 01:04:27,711
i'm so sorry, ruth.

1218
01:04:27,775 --> 01:04:30,773
i just wasn't thinking.

1219
01:04:32,251 --> 01:04:34,715
i wanted to have more, uh...

1220
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:37,221
but we had frank and...

1221
01:04:39,158 --> 01:04:42,388
matt was just starting his practice...

1222
01:04:43,729 --> 01:04:46,197
so i guess it made sense.

1223
01:04:57,243 --> 01:04:59,678
little charles.

1224
01:04:59,778 --> 01:05:00,857
willis: only got half a cord...

1225
01:05:00,957 --> 01:05:01,747
of oak left at home.

1226
01:05:01,847 --> 01:05:04,913
and you know how much that
bastard daniels charges.

1227
01:05:05,013 --> 01:05:07,048
at least i can stack this up to the cabin...

1228
01:05:07,148 --> 01:05:09,953
have something to burn this fall.

1229
01:05:16,228 --> 01:05:17,226
katie: you know,

1230
01:05:17,326 --> 01:05:18,798
it's a wonderful product...

1231
01:05:18,898 --> 01:05:20,664
and they treat you pretty good.

1232
01:05:20,764 --> 01:05:23,832
on account of selling mary kay,
we got the new subaru.

1233
01:05:23,932 --> 01:05:25,900
well, the ride up was very comfortable.

1234
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,069
it's a very nice car.

1235
01:05:27,169 --> 01:05:28,439
well, it's not really a car.

1236
01:05:28,539 --> 01:05:30,875
it's got four-wheel drive.
it's a little suv.

1237
01:05:30,975 --> 01:05:34,076
what is... the hell is all that 'suv' crap?

1238
01:05:34,176 --> 01:05:36,081
willis: sports utility vehicie.

1239
01:05:36,181 --> 01:05:37,549
it's a little jeep.

1240
01:05:37,649 --> 01:05:39,749
suv?

1241
01:05:39,849 --> 01:05:43,419
( laughing ): 'atv' and 'kfc'...

1242
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:46,088
what's with all these,
uh, these, uh...?

1243
01:05:46,188 --> 01:05:47,593
-acronyms.
- yeah.

1244
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:49,657
i guess it's just too much trouble...

1245
01:05:49,757 --> 01:05:52,164
to say what something is anymore.

1246
01:05:52,264 --> 01:05:53,761
what does 'pms' stand for?

1247
01:05:53,861 --> 01:05:55,768
all right, i was an army brat.

1248
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:58,099
i grew up with jeeps.

1249
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,072
willy's... he's uncomfortable...

1250
01:06:00,172 --> 01:06:03,806
that i know more about one
masculine thing than he does.

1251
01:06:03,906 --> 01:06:05,041
only one?

1252
01:06:05,141 --> 01:06:06,478
-( chuckling ):
- oh...

1253
01:06:06,578 --> 01:06:08,075
thanks, buddy.

1254
01:06:08,175 --> 01:06:10,175
i like this guy.

1255
01:06:19,959 --> 01:06:23,390
you've done a nice job up here, katie.

1256
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:26,297
don't tell me you made these curtains.

1257
01:06:26,397 --> 01:06:27,895
is that antique linen?

1258
01:06:27,995 --> 01:06:28,963
well, sort of.

1259
01:06:29,063 --> 01:06:31,904
they're pillowcases from our first house.

1260
01:06:32,004 --> 01:06:34,554
i've saved every knick knack...

1261
01:06:34,602 --> 01:06:36,982
and whim-wham we ever had...

1262
01:06:37,041 --> 01:06:39,477
you included.

1263
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:00,495
willis: well... our timing is off.

1264
01:07:00,595 --> 01:07:02,595
( matt chuckles )...

1265
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:15,480
( metal whining )...

1266
01:07:21,087 --> 01:07:22,867
willis: of course, he don't like working...

1267
01:07:22,967 --> 01:07:24,123
in recruitment, anyhows.

1268
01:07:24,223 --> 01:07:26,023
christ, they got them boys coming down...

1269
01:07:26,123 --> 01:07:27,324
to the office in the mall.

1270
01:07:27,424 --> 01:07:29,328
he gets them half-processed
and they decide...

1271
01:07:29,428 --> 01:07:31,560
they want to take
that 'delayed entry' thing.

1272
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:32,795
christ, i couldn't do it.

1273
01:07:32,895 --> 01:07:34,068
katie: or they decide not...

1274
01:07:34,168 --> 01:07:34,900
to join up at all.

1275
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,234
willis: like that one kid, there.

1276
01:07:37,334 --> 01:07:41,122
he had him all the way
through the works and... christ.

1277
01:07:41,222 --> 01:07:44,509
yeah... the boy's folks
called, uh, called david...

1278
01:07:44,609 --> 01:07:48,711
and said that the boy was...
he wanted out so bad that he...

1279
01:07:48,811 --> 01:07:50,981
well, he'd taken his own life.

1280
01:07:51,081 --> 01:07:54,065
something like that gets to you.

1281
01:07:54,165 --> 01:07:56,621
christ, i couldn't do it.

1282
01:08:12,438 --> 01:08:13,968
i'm going now.

1283
01:08:14,068 --> 01:08:16,337
okay.

1284
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:22,045
are you looking forward to going back?

1285
01:08:22,145 --> 01:08:25,079
mm-hmm.

1286
01:08:25,179 --> 01:08:27,210
you look nice.

1287
01:08:50,776 --> 01:08:52,776
( chuckles )...

1288
01:08:57,750 --> 01:09:01,068
( laughing )...

1289
01:09:01,168 --> 01:09:04,286
( woman singing )...

1290
01:09:04,386 --> 01:09:07,531
( choir singing balkan folk song )...

1291
01:09:14,466 --> 01:09:17,128
( choir continuing )...

1292
01:09:36,889 --> 01:09:38,889
♫ ♫...

1293
01:09:57,343 --> 01:09:58,277
( singing stops )...

1294
01:09:58,377 --> 01:09:59,491
that was very good.

1295
01:09:59,591 --> 01:10:02,311
i goofed up a little bit, but...

1296
01:10:10,756 --> 01:10:12,756
♫ ♫...

1297
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:33,224
ruth.

1298
01:10:33,324 --> 01:10:35,324
( gasps )...

1299
01:10:37,883 --> 01:10:39,883
it comes in waves...

1300
01:10:41,787 --> 01:10:45,021
and then nothing...

1301
01:10:45,121 --> 01:10:48,510
like a rest in music...

1302
01:10:48,610 --> 01:10:51,085
no sound, but so loud.

1303
01:10:55,935 --> 01:10:57,336
i don't know what to do.

1304
01:10:57,436 --> 01:11:01,271
i... i feel so angry.

1305
01:11:03,876 --> 01:11:07,073
Iouise mcvey...

1306
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:10,194
lost a child a few years back.

1307
01:11:10,294 --> 01:11:13,080
maybe you remember.

1308
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:15,053
she had four.

1309
01:11:15,153 --> 01:11:16,454
it was the youngest, wasn't it?

1310
01:11:16,554 --> 01:11:18,823
yes.

1311
01:11:18,923 --> 01:11:22,406
she told me about a vision she had...

1312
01:11:22,506 --> 01:11:26,055
when she found out her daughter had died.

1313
01:11:26,165 --> 01:11:29,934
she saw herself at a great
distance from the earth...

1314
01:11:30,034 --> 01:11:33,771
and encircling it,
an endless line.

1315
01:11:33,871 --> 01:11:36,190
as she got closer...

1316
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:39,892
she saw that it was made up of mothers...

1317
01:11:39,992 --> 01:11:42,797
traveling forward.

1318
01:11:42,897 --> 01:11:46,700
she fell into line and
began walking with them.

1319
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,860
when they reached a certain point...

1320
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:53,589
the line divided,
and she said she knew...

1321
01:11:53,689 --> 01:11:58,744
that all the millions of women on her side...

1322
01:11:58,844 --> 01:12:03,234
were the mothers who had lost children.

1323
01:12:11,844 --> 01:12:15,803
she seemed to find great comfort in that.

1324
01:12:20,052 --> 01:12:22,032
how did the little girl die?

1325
01:12:22,132 --> 01:12:27,115
a drowning, some kind
of swimming accident.

1326
01:12:27,226 --> 01:12:29,226
oh.

1327
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:43,489
the name of the game is texas chase 'em.

1328
01:12:43,589 --> 01:12:44,509
henry: oh, geez.

1329
01:12:44,609 --> 01:12:45,555
willis: is there a problem?

1330
01:12:45,655 --> 01:12:47,596
why do you always delude
yourself with that crap?

1331
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:48,709
what are you talking about?

1332
01:12:48,809 --> 01:12:50,496
look, we're not in vegas.

1333
01:12:50,596 --> 01:12:53,085
it's five-card draw or seven-card stud.

1334
01:12:53,185 --> 01:12:56,616
that's what i said--
five-card draw, jacks to open.

1335
01:12:56,716 --> 01:12:58,421
-carl?
- asshole.

1336
01:12:58,521 --> 01:13:00,206
( chuckling )...

1337
01:13:00,306 --> 01:13:02,660
i'll bet a buck.

1338
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,760
raise a buck.

1339
01:13:12,204 --> 01:13:14,204
( sighs )...

1340
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:29,535
say something, for chrissake.

1341
01:13:29,635 --> 01:13:34,554
quit pussyfooting around me.

1342
01:13:34,654 --> 01:13:38,479
you want me to stare
at these cards all night?

1343
01:13:54,046 --> 01:13:59,850
'there are things of which i may not speak...

1344
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:04,587
'there are dreams that cannot die...

1345
01:14:04,687 --> 01:14:09,893
'there are thoughts that make
the strong heart weak...

'and bring a pallor into the cheek...

01:14:13,729 --> 01:14:19,003
'and a mist before the eye...

'and the words of that fatal song...

01:14:22,872 --> 01:14:28,612
'come over me like a chill:

you look very pretty.

1362
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,953
you know where we're going tonight?

1363
01:16:20,053 --> 01:16:21,156
it's a surprise.

1372
01:17:55,687 --> 01:17:57,687
ah.

1373
01:18:00,459 --> 01:18:03,094
( engine continues droning )...

1374
01:18:16,908 --> 01:18:18,908
( gulls calling )...

1375
01:19:11,530 --> 01:19:13,530
♫ ♫...

1376
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:24,137
sportscaster ( over radio ):
atianta one; red sox nothing.

1377
01:19:24,237 --> 01:19:25,807
from the stretch, martinez.

1378
01:19:25,907 --> 01:19:28,943
still one and two on jordan.
he's hit 13 home runs.

1379
01:19:29,043 --> 01:19:31,579
he's got a teammate at third with two down.

1380
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:35,053
ramon martinez gets the sign,
checks the runner at third.

1381
01:19:35,153 --> 01:19:37,184
comes to the belt and to the plate.

1382
01:19:37,284 --> 01:19:39,387
a swing and a bouncer up the middle.

1383
01:19:39,487 --> 01:19:42,057
nomar fields it,
gloves it, throws to first.

1384

inning over.

1385
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,896
they leave a man in scoring position.

1386
01:19:45,996 --> 01:19:47,866
jordan's out-- six to three.

1387
01:19:47,966 --> 01:19:50,869
good effort in that inning
by ramon martinez...

1388
01:19:50,969 --> 01:19:52,466

matt: no.

1392
01:20:00,007 --> 01:20:03,026
i'm sorry,
that's totally unacceptable.

1393
01:20:03,126 --> 01:20:05,275
yeah, so what did he say?

1394
01:20:07,285 --> 01:20:09,586
he... no, we can't allow that.
( knocking at door )...

1395

1396
01:20:11,156 --> 01:20:12,287
excuse me, matt.

1408
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:37,914
that's right.

1409
01:20:43,355 --> 01:20:45,453
he's across the street.

1410
01:20:45,553 --> 01:20:47,553
thank you.

1411
01:21:14,252 --> 01:21:16,802

1412
01:21:18,089 --> 01:21:19,389
oh, hey, matt.

1413
01:21:19,489 --> 01:21:21,489

oh, hi, jack.

1418
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:30,699
- don.
- hi, don.

1419
01:21:30,799 --> 01:21:32,052
this is ed.

1420
01:21:32,152 --> 01:21:33,403
- hi.
- that's matt fowler.

1421
01:21:33,503 --> 01:21:35,485
so... how's everything going?

1422
01:21:35,585 --> 01:21:39,877
oh, uh, it's-it's-it's okay, you know, uh...

1423
01:21:39,977 --> 01:21:44,248
i just wanted to go over a
couple of things, and, uh...

1424
01:21:44,348 --> 01:21:47,550
you know, when-when
you've had your lunch.

1425
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:48,986
sure.

1426
01:21:49,086 --> 01:21:51,585
we really are doing
everything we can, matt.

1427
01:21:51,685 --> 01:21:53,203
i promise you that.

1428
01:21:53,303 --> 01:21:55,057
yeah. what can I do, bill?

1429
01:21:55,157 --> 01:21:56,589
there's nothing, really.

1430
01:21:56,689 --> 01:21:58,242
look, it can't be manslaughter.

1431
01:21:58,342 --> 01:21:59,843
there's got to be something.

1432
01:21:59,943 --> 01:22:01,731
can't you find something,
you know...

1433
01:22:01,831 --> 01:22:03,634
like... like some piece of evidence?

1434
01:22:03,734 --> 01:22:06,036
i mean, that happens.
doesn't that happen?

1435
01:22:06,136 --> 01:22:07,752
we really are doing everything we can.

1436
01:22:07,852 --> 01:22:10,404
i'm not going to lie to you--
all we've got is strout.

1437
01:22:10,504 --> 01:22:12,077
he claims that there was a struggle.

1438
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:14,427
forensics can't determine
if there was a struggle...

1439
01:22:14,527 --> 01:22:17,381
because of the condition of the house...

1440
01:22:17,481 --> 01:22:19,063
when frank got there.

1441
01:22:19,163 --> 01:22:21,552
the best thing for you to do is...

1442
01:22:21,652 --> 01:22:22,554
just sit tight.

1443
01:22:22,654 --> 01:22:24,837
now, we haven't thrown in the towel yet...

1444
01:22:24,937 --> 01:22:26,374
and you shouldn't either.

1445
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:28,022
we've still got two investigators...

1446
01:22:28,122 --> 01:22:29,325
working on this case.

1447
01:22:29,425 --> 01:22:31,218
( voice fading ): it's still a priority...

1448
01:22:31,318 --> 01:22:31,930
case for us.

1449
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:33,898
we've got leads we're following up on.

1450
01:22:33,998 --> 01:22:35,231
( coins jingling loudly )...

1451
01:22:35,331 --> 01:22:37,135
we still got a lot of things to do, here...

1452
01:22:37,235 --> 01:22:38,433
before we wrap this up...

1453
01:22:38,533 --> 01:22:41,186
but we're doing the best we can
with the resources that we have.

1454
01:22:41,286 --> 01:22:43,708
you've just got to hang in there with us.

1455
01:22:43,808 --> 01:22:45,789
you have to have some confidence.

1456
01:22:45,889 --> 01:22:49,145
(jingling )...

1457
01:22:49,245 --> 01:22:52,445
( whistle blows )...

1458
01:23:00,258 --> 01:23:03,076
( truck engine starts )...

1459
01:23:03,176 --> 01:23:04,528
( car engine starts )...

1460
01:23:04,628 --> 01:23:05,902
man: he takes these bats...

1461
01:23:06,002 --> 01:23:06,731
and nails them...

1462
01:23:06,831 --> 01:23:08,665
right on the wall above the scale...

1463
01:23:08,765 --> 01:23:11,568
because he knows bigmouth's
going to come in there...

1464
01:23:11,668 --> 01:23:13,937
and weigh his catch eventually,
you know?

1465
01:23:14,037 --> 01:23:16,187
he's putting the bats up,
one of the old-timers says...

1466
01:23:16,287 --> 01:23:17,922
'hey, ivan, what the hell are you doing?'

1467
01:23:18,022 --> 01:23:19,556
the old man says,
'sending a message'

1468
01:23:19,656 --> 01:23:21,624
and turns around
and walks out the door, right?

1469
01:23:21,724 --> 01:23:22,664
now, i walk in, there's...

1470
01:23:22,764 --> 01:23:24,795
these damn baseball bats
up on the wall, right...

1471
01:23:24,895 --> 01:23:27,532
with a big, huge note written
right across the front of them.

1472
01:23:27,632 --> 01:23:29,666
what'd it say?

1473
01:23:29,766 --> 01:23:32,437
'here's the bats,
if you got the balls.'

1474
01:23:32,537 --> 01:23:35,493
( laughing )...

1475
01:23:37,829 --> 01:23:39,764
he never messed with our traps again.

1476
01:23:39,864 --> 01:23:41,114
hey, dr. fowler.

1477
01:23:41,214 --> 01:23:44,849
oh, hi, tim.

1478
01:23:44,949 --> 01:23:47,805
did he ever, uh....

1479
01:23:47,905 --> 01:23:51,922
does he ever talk to you
about what happened on that day?

1480
01:23:52,022 --> 01:23:54,828
no. no.

1481
01:23:54,928 --> 01:23:56,662
i don't even see richard anymore...

1482
01:23:56,762 --> 01:23:58,829
and he'd never tell me anything anyway.

1483
01:23:58,929 --> 01:24:00,051
believe me.

1484
01:24:00,151 --> 01:24:02,784
oh, sure, sure.
of course not.

1485
01:24:02,884 --> 01:24:05,206
i was just wondering if-if, uh, you know...

1486
01:24:05,306 --> 01:24:08,059
maybe you heard something
through the grapevine.

1487
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:12,409
maybe, uh, maybe one
of his buddies said something?

1488
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:15,180
no.

1489
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,064
i was thinking--...

1490
01:24:18,169 --> 01:24:19,801
his brothers still work with you, right?

1491
01:24:19,901 --> 01:24:22,897
they must talk.

1492
01:24:25,877 --> 01:24:28,892
what i'm saying is,
if we could find something--...

1493
01:24:28,992 --> 01:24:30,560
just something concrete.

1494
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:32,083
if you could...

1495
01:24:32,183 --> 01:24:36,882
it could be just, you know,
a slip of the tongue.

1496
01:24:42,761 --> 01:24:45,730
i'll keep my ears open.

1497
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:51,367
thank you.

1498
01:24:51,467 --> 01:24:55,930
it's funny running into
you... here, dr. fowler.

1499
01:24:58,009 --> 01:25:00,009
yeah, well...

1500
01:25:03,414 --> 01:25:07,919
( music filtering indistinctly
through headphones )...

1501
01:25:23,768 --> 01:25:25,203
( clicks/music stops )...

1502
01:25:25,303 --> 01:25:29,556
oh, i was hoping we could talk.

1503
01:25:29,656 --> 01:25:33,876
i...

1504
01:25:33,976 --> 01:25:40,565
i wanted to tell you how truly sorry i am...

1505
01:25:40,665 --> 01:25:42,885
and...

1506
01:25:42,985 --> 01:25:48,072
if there's anything that i can ever... do...

1507
01:25:48,172 --> 01:25:51,393
to-to...

1508
01:25:51,493 --> 01:25:53,953
talk with you...

1509
01:25:57,969 --> 01:25:59,969
oh.

1510
01:26:13,084 --> 01:26:16,569
( music filtering through headphones )...

1511
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:28,263
( laughter )...

1512
01:26:28,363 --> 01:26:30,465
man, better get back to the grind...

1513
01:26:30,565 --> 01:26:32,167
and don't steal anything.

1514
01:26:32,267 --> 01:26:34,267
hello, mrs. fowler.

1515
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:41,141
will there be anything else?

1516
01:26:41,241 --> 01:26:43,046
i want a pack of marlboro lights.

1517
01:26:43,146 --> 01:26:45,146
sure.

1518
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:55,051
that will be, uh, $14.95 with the cigarettes.

1519
01:27:02,066 --> 01:27:04,066
thank you.

1520
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:10,473
( slams )...

1521
01:27:14,279 --> 01:27:17,043
matt: how did it go today?

1522
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:33,261
something wrong?

1523
01:27:33,361 --> 01:27:34,631
wrong?

1524
01:27:34,731 --> 01:27:36,941
what could be wrong, matt?

1525
01:27:57,121 --> 01:27:58,753
what do you want?

1526
01:27:58,853 --> 01:28:01,025
i want to know what's going on.

1527
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:03,392
oh, right.

1528
01:28:03,492 --> 01:28:05,295
you're obviously upset.

1529
01:28:05,395 --> 01:28:07,495
is there something we can talk about?

1530
01:28:07,595 --> 01:28:09,595
talk?

1531
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,600
who, us?

1532
01:28:11,664 --> 01:28:13,402
what if somebody walked in?

1533
01:28:13,502 --> 01:28:14,906
they wouldn't recognize us.

1534
01:28:15,006 --> 01:28:18,241
they'd think they were in the wrong house.

1535
01:28:18,341 --> 01:28:20,475
do you want to talk or not?

1536
01:28:20,575 --> 01:28:22,345
oh, you mean about our dead son?

1537
01:28:22,445 --> 01:28:24,213
no.

1538
01:28:24,313 --> 01:28:26,015
we haven't before.

1539
01:28:26,115 --> 01:28:29,318
why should we bother now?

1540
01:28:29,418 --> 01:28:31,688
what can i do, ruth?

1541
01:28:31,788 --> 01:28:33,820
forget it, matt.

1542
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:36,293
why don't you just go?

1543
01:28:36,393 --> 01:28:39,196
what do you want from me?

1544
01:28:39,296 --> 01:28:41,131
i want you to stop...

1545
01:28:41,231 --> 01:28:43,364
acting like nothing's happened.

1546
01:28:43,464 --> 01:28:44,801
that's what i want.

1547
01:28:44,901 --> 01:28:48,556
why, because i'm not
bouncing off the walls?

1548
01:28:48,636 --> 01:28:50,839
no, matt,
that would require feelings.

1549
01:28:50,939 --> 01:28:52,973
we don't want you to hurt yourself.

1550
01:28:53,073 --> 01:28:54,507
do me a favor, ruth.

1551
01:28:54,607 --> 01:28:58,772
you want a grieving contest,
go find someone else.

1552
01:28:59,951 --> 01:29:01,948
oh, i know how you grieve.

1553
01:29:02,048 --> 01:29:04,048
go have another beer.

1554
01:29:06,024 --> 01:29:09,089
what the hell is that supposed to mean?

1555
01:29:09,189 --> 01:29:10,960
what do you know?

1556
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:12,329
you know nothing.

1557
01:29:12,429 --> 01:29:15,333
you don't... you don't know
what i go through.

1558
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:18,533
no, i don't know what
you go through, matt...

1559
01:29:18,633 --> 01:29:20,803
or if you go through anything.

1560
01:29:20,903 --> 01:29:24,472
but that's your choice, dear,
not mine.

1561
01:29:24,572 --> 01:29:26,021
you're goddamn right it is.

1562
01:29:26,121 --> 01:29:28,276
my choice is not to scream at the world.

1563
01:29:28,376 --> 01:29:31,029
maybe one of us has to be
reasonable around here.

1564
01:29:31,129 --> 01:29:32,381
you ever think of that?

1565
01:29:32,481 --> 01:29:34,030
reasonable?

1566
01:29:34,130 --> 01:29:36,130
gee, matt...

1567
01:29:36,136 --> 01:29:40,040
i don't know about you,
but i miss my son.

1568
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:42,026
i'm glad you have time for reason.

1569
01:29:42,126 --> 01:29:45,592
that's what you imparted
to frank, that sense of reason.

1570
01:29:45,692 --> 01:29:46,929
( dish clatters )...

1571
01:29:47,029 --> 01:29:50,429
oh, he thought you were very reasonable.

1572
01:29:51,769 --> 01:29:54,101
what are you talking about?

1573
01:29:57,442 --> 01:29:59,442
nothing.

1574
01:30:04,382 --> 01:30:07,847
are you...
are you saying that...

1575
01:30:07,947 --> 01:30:11,616
that i'm the one... responsible?

1576
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:15,190
is that it?

1577
01:30:15,290 --> 01:30:17,391
well, uh...

1578
01:30:17,491 --> 01:30:19,030
well, let me tell you something.

1579
01:30:19,130 --> 01:30:20,362
let me tell you something.

1580
01:30:20,462 --> 01:30:22,664
you got it backwards.
( water stops running )...

1581
01:30:22,764 --> 01:30:25,135
i know what you think--
that, uh... that i was...

1582
01:30:25,235 --> 01:30:26,165
too lenient.

1583
01:30:26,265 --> 01:30:28,003
that i let him get away with...

1584
01:30:28,103 --> 01:30:29,136
everything.

1585
01:30:29,236 --> 01:30:30,141
everything.

1586
01:30:30,241 --> 01:30:31,372
yes, yes, yes, and why?.

1587
01:30:31,472 --> 01:30:32,674
why didn't he ever come to you?.

1588
01:30:32,774 --> 01:30:34,009
he wouldn't listen to me, matt.

1589
01:30:34,109 --> 01:30:35,378
no, he wouldn't listen to you...

1590
01:30:35,478 --> 01:30:37,212
he wouldn't trust me.
you made sure of that.

1591
01:30:37,312 --> 01:30:38,277
he wouldn't listen to you...

1592
01:30:38,377 --> 01:30:39,750
because you never listened to him.

1593
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:40,948
no, but you did.

1594
01:30:41,048 --> 01:30:43,651
you were winking at him the whole time.

1595
01:30:43,751 --> 01:30:45,021
you encouraged him.

1596
01:30:45,121 --> 01:30:47,041
you wanted what he had: her.

1597
01:30:47,141 --> 01:30:49,858
oh, my god,
you've got to be kidding.

1598
01:30:49,958 --> 01:30:50,995
come on, you know it.

1599
01:30:51,095 --> 01:30:53,261
you wanted it and you couldn't get it.

1600
01:30:53,361 --> 01:30:55,165
that's why you didn't stop him--...

1601
01:30:55,265 --> 01:30:57,832
so you could get your kicks
through your son.

1602
01:30:57,932 --> 01:31:00,805
you can't admit the truth
to me or to yourself...

1603
01:31:00,905 --> 01:31:04,073
that frank died for your
fantasy piece of ass.

1604
01:31:04,173 --> 01:31:06,639
( under breath ): oh, y...

1605
01:31:06,739 --> 01:31:10,412
you know, y... you want to know
why our son is dead?

1606
01:31:10,512 --> 01:31:12,247
you really want to know?

1607
01:31:12,347 --> 01:31:16,282
he was with her not because of me.

1608
01:31:16,382 --> 01:31:18,188
he went there because of you.

1609
01:31:18,288 --> 01:31:19,420
yes, he did...

1610
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:22,589
because you are so...
controlling...

1611
01:31:22,689 --> 01:31:26,429
so overbearing...

1612
01:31:26,529 --> 01:31:29,366
so angry that he was it...

1613
01:31:29,466 --> 01:31:31,667
that he was our only one.

1614
01:31:31,767 --> 01:31:33,037
that is not true.

1615
01:31:33,137 --> 01:31:34,937
oh, yes, it is. yes, it is.

1616
01:31:35,037 --> 01:31:36,373
even when he was a kid...

1617
01:31:36,473 --> 01:31:39,539
you were telling him
how-how he was always wrong.

1618
01:31:39,639 --> 01:31:41,945
oh, i remember...

1619
01:31:42,045 --> 01:31:45,545
one time you yanked him
out of a little league game...

1620
01:31:45,645 --> 01:31:47,450
and sent him home...

1621
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:51,253
for throwing his-his glove in the dirt.

1622
01:31:51,353 --> 01:31:52,318
he was what?

1623
01:31:52,418 --> 01:31:54,585
nine years old?

1624
01:32:04,635 --> 01:32:07,116
everything he did...

1625
01:32:07,216 --> 01:32:09,216
was wrong.

1626
01:32:11,909 --> 01:32:16,312
well, what was wrong with him, ruth?

1627
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:25,221

1810
01:45:26,569 --> 01:45:28,370
uh, in the bedroom closet.

1811
01:45:28,470 --> 01:45:30,604

1813

where's the light?

1818
01:46:03,956 --> 01:46:05,956

1819
01:46:06,054 --> 01:46:08,054

1822
01:46:29,314 --> 01:46:31,893

1827
01:46:58,359 --> 01:47:00,842
he was always with her.

1828
01:47:00,942 --> 01:47:02,613
dr. fowler, it was an accident.

1829
01:47:02,713 --> 01:47:04,448
i'm going to jail to pay for it.

1830
01:47:04,548 --> 01:47:06,666
if i ever get out,
i'll be an old man.

1831
01:47:06,766 --> 01:47:08,452
isn't that enough?

1832
01:47:08,552 --> 01:47:10,677

1833
01:47:12,976 --> 01:47:15,526

1834
01:47:20,450 --> 01:47:23,184

1835
01:47:23,284 --> 01:47:26,020
