1
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,143
- Your ticket, please.
- Oh, yes.

2
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,337
- Welcome aboard, Miss Debenham.
- Thank you.

3
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:59,917
<i>Bosporus Ferry will shortly depart</i>
<i>from Istanbul Sirkeci Station,</i>

4
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,677
<i>connecting with the</i> Orient Express.

5
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,515
Here's your ticket,
Monsieur Poirot.

6
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,388
I'm afraid you've still got another hour.

7
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,857
Well, then, please do not wait.

8
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:15,727
Not wait? After all you've
done for us, Monsieur Poirot?

9
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:19,127
My general's orders were to
ensure your safe departure.

10
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:20,828
He also wished me
to thank you again

11
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,339
for saving the honor of the British
garrison in Jordan.

12
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,545
The brigadier's confession
was opportune.

13
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,180
I say, how did you do it?

14
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:33,113
Was it the old thumbscrew,
you know, the rack?

15
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:38,119
Yes. Well, you'll be able to rest
as soon as you get to Stamboul.

16
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,349
The...

17
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,394
The church of Santa Sofia
is absolutely magnificent.

18
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,497
You have seen it?

19
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,132
No.

20
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,194
Come on.

21
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,003
Move. Come on.

22
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,043
Get up. Come on.

23
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,172
Chop-chop.

24
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,584
I hope we did the right thing booking
you into a hotel on the European side

25
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,727
rather than the Asian side.

26
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,989
I have no prejudice against
either continent.

27
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,930
The... The crossing
should be pleasant.

28
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,970
The Bosporus is always calm.

29
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,503
You have crossed by the ferry?

30
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,402
No.

31
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:47,086
Welcome, Colonel Arbu...

32
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,318
Arbu... Arbut...

33
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,554
Arbuthnott.

34
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,860
<i>The Bosporus Ferry will shortly</i>
<i>depart for Istanbul Sirkeci Station,</i>

35
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,238
<i>connecting with the</i> Orient Express.

36
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,116
Not now.

37
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:16,254
Not now. When it's all over.
When it's behind us. Then.

38
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,794
What a funny little man.

39
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,227
Obviously a frog.

40
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,767
It can be important.

41
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,742
...between East and West, where you
can eat the finest Oriental food.

42
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,711
Good evening, sir.
This way, please.

43
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,717
<i>Ecco finalmente un amico</i>.

44
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,914
Monsieur Poirot.

45
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,354
Bianchi.

46
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,529
How are you, my friend?

47
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,199
- Good to see you.
- You have saved me from apoplexy.

48
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,631
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

49
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,602
You have not dined well.

50
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:17,208
The skewers are of better quality
than the kebab.

51
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,106
The bottle is more
distinguished than its wine.

52
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:23,645
And the coffee.

53
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,008
Fortunately, I have been called
to London. I leave tonight.

54
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,016
- On the <i>Orient Express</i>?
- How else?

55
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:34,022
<i>Evviva</i>! I have a traveling companion.
<i>Eccellente</i>.

56
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:37,354
Well, where shall we dine?

57
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,365
I am desolate, Monsieur Poirot.

58
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,978
There is not one single first-class
sleeping berth on the entire train.

59
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:59,179
- What? In December?
- In December, signor.

60
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,910
Has Bulgaria declared war on Turkey?

61
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,112
Are the aristocracy fleeing
the country?

62
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,551
I am a director of the line,

63
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,692
Monsieur Hercule Poirot
is not only a detective

64
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,056
of international fame and distinction,
but he is also my personal friend.

65
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,254
Signor Bianchi, Monsieur Poirot...

66
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,263
Courage, my friend,
we'll arrange something.

67
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,958
<i>Andiamo</i>!
We must go. Come on.

68
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:05,509
<i>The</i> Orient Express <i>will depart</i>
<i>from platform one at 9 p. M</i>.

69
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:09,779
<i>For Uzonköprü, Sofia, Belgrade,</i>

00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:17,327
<i>Zagreb, Brod, Trieste, Venice,</i>
<i>Milan, Lausanne,</i>

<i>Bett. Nummer sechs</i>.

78

<i>- Danke schön</i>.
<i>- Bitte schön</i>.

<i>Az Andrenyi Grófot es Grófnét</i>

<i>A 12-tes</i>.

82
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,844
Mrs. Hubbard.
It's always an honor to greet you.

83
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,708
You have your favorite number, 11.

84
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,678
<i>Ecco, Signor Bianchi</i>.
<i>Benvenuto</i>!

85
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,188
<i>Numero nove. Come sempre</i>.

86
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,485
<i>Grazie</i>, Pierre. I understand
that you are full up.

87
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:06,256
It's unbelievable, signor.
All the world elects to travel tonight.

88
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,866
Nonetheless, you must find room
for Monsieur Poirot here.

89
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,638
Monsieur Hercule Poirot?

90
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,934
- The famous...
- Precisely.

91
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,938
And he is also a personal
friend of mine.

92
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:22,842
Please be so good as to direct...

93
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,846
<i>Fröken Ohlsson, god afton</i>!
<i>Plats nummer sju</i>.

94
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,712
<i>Sju...</i>

95
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,389
Something is lost?

96
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,156
My little medal of St. Christopher,

97
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,732
to bring me luck and deliver...

98
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,835
Deliver me from evil.

99
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,305
Madame. Madame, lucky tooth
from St. Augustine of Hippo.

100
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,706
Madame. Madame, lucky tooth
from St. Augustine of Hippo.

101
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:53,537
- Lucky Buddha, Madame?
- Madame, lucky Buddha.

102
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,014
Thank God, my St. Christopher.

103
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,345
St. Christopher.

104
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,738
You see, my friend has been
urgently called to London

105
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,538
on a matter of
international importance,

106
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,443
and I have given him my
personal assurance

107
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,710
that you will secure an accommodation
for him on the coach to Calais.

108
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,684
- But, Signor Bianchi, I have already...
- Hector...

109
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,826
Excuse me, excuse me, gentlemen,
but Mr. Ratchett has reservations,

110
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,257
and we'd be grateful if we could
board immediately.

111
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,223
Mr. Ratchett.

112
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,663
Welcome to the number ten.

113
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:53,028
Mr. Beddoes, the lower berth
in number one.

114
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,139
Mr. McQueen, the lower berth
in number four.

115
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,367
- The upper berth is...
- As arranged.

116
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,609
Now, Pierre, it is cold.

117
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,114
Now we can place Monsieur
Poirot in the number 16,

118
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,013
which is always kept vacant.

119
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,984
It is taken, signor, by a Mr. Hardman.

120
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,013
Then as a director of the line,

121
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,126
I command you to place
Monsieur Poirot

122
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:19,320
in what we know to be the empty berth
above Mr. McQueen's number four.

123
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,556
Monsieur.

124
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,794
At least you can get two tips.

125
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,146
- Pardon, monsieur.
- Sorry.

126
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:50,192
- Pardon.
- Excuse me, signor.

127
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:07,569
Well, my second husband,
Mr. Hubbard, would have raised hell.

128
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,441
No place for my makeup bag,
no ice in my drinking water,

129
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,140
and the hot water burps as it
comes out of the faucet.

130
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,143
Pardon.

131
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:27,392
Have courage, my friend.
It is the last compartment but one.

132
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,567
Pardon.

133
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:39,941
No.

134
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:43,444
I think there's a mistake.

135
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,480
<i>Je crois que vous avez</i>
<i>fait une erreur</i>.

136
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,709
Mr. McQueen, there is no
other berth on the train.

137
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,512
Monsieur Poirot has to come in here.

138
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,211
Voilà, monsieur, all is arranged.

139
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,721
Yours is the upper berth,
the number four.

140
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,154
We start in one minute.

141
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,851
I apologize if I have
incommoded you here.

142
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,464
However, it is for one
night only at Belgrade Station.

143
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,100
Oh, I see. At Belgrade,
you're... You're getting off.

144
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,919
Better than the hotel?

145
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,526
I shall probably keep
the menu as a souvenir.

146
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:50,495
Hector, I ordered three Islamic
13th-century, perforated pottery bowls

147
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,260
and six beakers.

148
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:56,202
They delivered only five beakers,
and one of the bowls arrived chipped,

149
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,308
which it was not when I paid for it.

150
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,772
Through the nose.

151
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:03,846
- Send a telegram from Belgrade.
- Yes. Yes, Mr. Ratchett.

152
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,647
What's the matter? You look tired.

153
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,120
- I slept badly.
- Yeah, why?

154
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:15,086
The Belgian in the upper berth snored.

155
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:19,229
Really? Any other
unanswered letters on file?

156
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,133
Only the anonymous ones.

157
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,962
We can't answer those, can we?

158
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:28,269
You'd better go catch up
on your sleep...

159
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:32,603
...before the Belgian gentleman
gets back to your compartment.

160
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,203
Go on.

161
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,167
Hi. My name's Hardman.

162
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:08,778
Call me Dick.

163
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,472
- Foscarelli. Call me Gino.
- How are you?

164
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,914
Beddoes.

165
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:19,054
Mr. Beddoes.

166
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,623
For the pen of a Balzac.

167
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:27,060
For three days, all these people,
these total strangers,

168
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:31,361
meet in a single train whose
engine controls their destiny.

169
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:37,534
Yes, I know. We are both
envious of the husband.

170
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:39,437
Is?

171
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,442
Is the husband as British
as his tweeds?

172
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,638
Oh, heaven forbid.
He's a hot-blooded Hungarian.

173
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,444
If you but look at his wife,
he will cease to be a diplomat.

174
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,314
Thank God we are not young.

175
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,062
My second husband said
always to ask for change in dollars

176
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,669
or at worst, sterling.

177
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,635
So for Pete's sake,
what's a drachma?

178
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,401
It is... What do you call it?
The currency...

179
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:15,307
My second husband also said,
"Take a book of food tickets, Mama,

180
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,482
"and you'll have no problem,
no problem at all."

181
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,910
That just isn't so.

182
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:21,051
First there's this ten-percent tip. Five
would've done the steward more...

183
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,777
I think Miss Ohlsson has a headache.

184
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,513
Would you forgive us if we went back
to the compartment, Mrs. Hubbard?

185
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:26,952
Gladly, if you must.

186
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,649
If you need aspirin,
I always carry it on my person.

187
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,420
I mistrust foreign drugs.

188
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,895
You must excuse me,
Mrs. Hubbard is upon us.

189
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,925
What's the matter with him?
Train-sick or something?

190
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:44,006
Some of us, in the words of the divine
Greta Garbo, "want to be alone".

191
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,380
And for dinner this evening?

192
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:59,648
You will have the goodness
to serve me the poached sole

193
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,826
with one new potato

194
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:06,657
and a small green salad
with no dressing. Hildegarde.

195
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,096
Who was that majestic lady?

196
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:13,237
- The Princess Dragomiroff.
- I have heard.

197
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:31,750
Pardon me, sir.

198
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,221
I wonder if you could
oblige me with a light.

199
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,417
Certainly.

200
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,095
Thank you.
My name is Ratchett.

201
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:42,198
Do I have the pleasure of speaking
to Mr. Hercule Poirot?

202
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,062
The pleasure possibly, Mr. Ratchett,
the intention certainly.

203
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,601
You asked me for a light.

204
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,137
I offered you one,
and you have not used it.

205
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:53,071
One can deduce that without
acute mental exhaustion.

206
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,473
That's wonderful. Sit down, sir.

207
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,170
- For a moment.
- Just for a moment.

208
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,543
Thank you very much.

209
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,175
Well, Mr. Poirot.

210
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,379
- Poirot.
- How's that?

211
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:07,353
- Poirot.
- Oh, Poirot. Right.

212
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:12,861
I just wanted to say that in my country
we also come quickly to the point.

213
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,096
I want you to take a job on for me.

214
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,363
It means big money.

215
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,235
Very big money.

216
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:29,106
What is the case, or, as you put it, the
job which you wish me to undertake?

217
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,181
Mr. Poirot, I'm a rich man.

218
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:36,343
Naturally, men in my
position have enemies.

219
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,681
Only one.

220
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,482
Now, what the hell
do you mean by that?

221
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:43,957
Merely that when a man is in a position
to have, as you say, enemies,

222
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:49,156
it does not usually resolve
itself into one enemy only.

223
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:52,666
Oh. Oh, sure. Sure. I appreciate that.

224
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:55,237
What is your profession?

225
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,340
I'm retired.

226
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,567
- From what?
- Business.

227
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,204
What sort of business?

228
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,446
Baby food.

229
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:07,209
But what does that matter?
What matters is my safety.

230
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:08,647
You are in danger?

231
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,048
My life has been threatened,
Mr. Poirot.

232
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:15,354
My secretary can show
you two letters on file.

233
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,529
And I... can show you this.

234
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,298
I sleep on it.

235
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,637
Mr. Poirot...

236
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,269
...5,000 dollars.

237
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,504
No?

238
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,477
Ten thousand?

239
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,381
Fifteen thousand.

240
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,017
Mr. Ratchett, I have
made enough money

241
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:46,122
to satisfy both my needs
and my caprices.

242
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,915
I take only such cases now
as interest me,

243
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:55,225
and to be frank, my interest
in your case is... dwindling.

244
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,478
<i>Belgrade Station</i>.

245
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:48,277
<i>The</i> Orient Express <i>will</i>
<i>depart in five minutes</i>.

246
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:54,586
Monsieur Poirot.

247
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,660
I am transferring Signor Bianchi's
luggage to the Pullman.

248
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,386
He's giving you
his own compartment.

249
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:01,155
But you cannot sit up all night.

250
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,267
My dear friend,
do not concern yourself.

251
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,596
Since you are going to England,
it is better for you

252
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,397
to stay on the through coach
to Calais.

253
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,369
Now, Pierre has made me
very comfortable.

254
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:13,408
There is no one in the Pullman
but one Greek doctor. <i>Ecco</i>.

255
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:17,172
- Such generosity deserves my thanks.
<i>- Buon riposa</i>.

256
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,006
- Monsieur Poirot.
- Pierre,

257
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:51,842
- could I have some clean towels and...
- Yes, monsieur.

258
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,813
Who are my new neighbors?

259
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,885
To the left, monsieur,
the Swedish lady, Miss Ohlsson,

260
00:30:57,088 --> 00:31:00,080
shares seven and eight with
the English lady, Miss Debenham.

261
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,953
And to the right, in number ten,
is Mr. Ratchett.

262
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,890
And where is the loquacious
Mrs. Hubbard?

263
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:06,825
I should like to get some
sleep tonight.

264
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,828
Beyond Mr. Ratchett,
in the number 11.

265
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,796
She is still too near.

266
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,970
Good night, Mr. Beddoes.

267
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,028
Pardon.

268
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:22,841
Who is it?

269
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,641
It's me, sir, Beddoes,
with your sedative.

270
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,419
Come in.

271
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,851
Thank you, Pierre. Good night.

272
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:42,158
Good night, monsieur,
and pleasant dreams in number nine.

273
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,601
- How many drops?
- Of the valerian?

274
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:48,863
- Two, sir, as you said.
- OK.

275
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:53,133
No, no. Put it on the table.

276
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,308
And tell Mr. McQueen I want
to see the text of the telegram

277
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,817
he sent from Belgrade.

278
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,252
Very well, sir.

279
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,167
He wants you.

280
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:53,995
Come in.

281
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,034
<i>La belle Comtesse</i>.

282
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,194
<i>Ce n'est rien</i>.
<i>C'était un cauchemar</i>.

283
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:38,399
<i>Bien</i>, Mr. Ratchett.
May you now have pleasant dreams.

284
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,953
<i>C'est le silence de mort</i>.

285
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:18,006
Snowdrift. <i>Mon Dieu. Quelle nuit</i>.

286
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,452
So now there's a man in my room.

287
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:24,985
I woke up in the dark
three minutes ago,

288
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:27,680
and there was a man hiding
in this compartment. I sensed it.

289
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,826
What's more, I know who he was
because I absent-mindedly

290
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,154
nearly walked through
his open door earlier this evening.

291
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,591
"Madame," said this Mr. Ratchett,

292
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,164
"If you'd done this 20 years ago,
I'd have said come in."

293
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,858
Twenty years ago?
Why, I'd only have been 15.

294
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:45,707
If there should be a reoccurrence,
do not hesitate to ring, Madame.

295
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:54,150
<i>Enfin c'est le comble</i>.

296
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,532
<i>Evidemment, j'ai une crise de nerfs</i>.

297
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:43,322
It's me, sir, Beddoes,
with your pick-me-up.

298
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:51,234
Your amber moon, Mr. Ratchett.

299
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:10,054
Your passkey.

300
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,032
The chain.

301
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,942
Pierre, touch nothing.

302
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,044
Where are Signor Bianchi
and the Greek doctor?

303
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,880
In the dining car, monsieur.

304
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,022
Fetch them at once.

305
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,003
Well, can't you tap
the telephone wires?

306
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,611
- Or fire a rocket, or something?
- This is not a ship, Madame.

307
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,407
- Where exactly are we?
- We are between Vinkovci and Brod.

308
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,107
- But in what country?
- In Yugoslavia.

309
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,583
The Balkans.
What else can you expect?

310
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,222
Snow is God's will.
And all is for the best.

311
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:16,689
Yeah, but how long do you think before
we can start getting out of here?

312
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,555
As soon as the stationmaster
at Brod sees

313
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,357
that we do not arrive on time,
he will send...

314
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:27,226
Dr. Constantine,
Monsieur Poirot wants to see you.

315
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,838
And you too, Signor Bianchi.

316
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,100
Forgive me, ladies and gentlemen.

317
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,609
Only God's forgiveness is important.

318
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,647
<i>Ich mochte meine Prinzessin</i>
<i>benachrichtigen</i>.

319
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,579
Signor Bianchi
and Dr. Constantine.

320
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:47,519
Mind the broken glass, gentlemen.

321
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:55,896
Pupils still slightly dilated.
Could've been drugged.

322
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,967
- Was drugged.
- With what?

323
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,801
There's a smell of valerian,
which is harmless,

324
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,566
but something must've been added.

325
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,446
- May I close his eyes now?
- I wish you would.

326
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:14,743
Why did he lose so much blood?

327
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,078
- Can I pull back the bedclothes?
- By all means.

328
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:27,521
Mr. Ratchett has been
frontally stabbed

329
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:30,701
ten, 11, 12 times.

330
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,732
- Oh, <i>Dio</i>.
<i>- Mon pauvre</i>.

331
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:35,565
If you must go whoop-whoop,
please go whoop-whoop

332
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:39,800
not to windward, but to leeward.
Help him, Pierre.

333
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,944
There is something in the pocket.

334
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,548
Permit me.

335
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:54,251
- His watch.
- The time of death.

336
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,358
I can definitely say
that death occurred

337
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,960
between midnight
and 2 in the morning.

338
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:01,393
That would fit.

339
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:08,537
I myself heard him cry out and ring for
the conductor at 20 minutes to 1.

340
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,636
When Pierre arrived, he apologized

341
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:13,901
and said he had been
having a <i>cauchemar</i>.

342
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:16,375
A nightmare.

343
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:23,083
Then I heard him
use his washbasin.

344
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:27,249
And that is the last thing known.

345
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:33,458
I beg of you, monsieur.
You cannot refuse.

346
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:36,224
But it is the duty
of the Yugoslavian police.

347
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:41,531
Oh, what, monsieur, to question
my passengers on my line? Never.

348
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,606
Now you must solve the mystery.

349
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:47,471
When we get to Brod, if we ever do,

350
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:50,306
we present the police with
a <i>fait accompli</i>.

351
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:54,610
We say that a murder has occurred.
There is the criminal.

352
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,515
I should like
the Pullman coach reserved

353
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,382
for the investigation's headquarters.

354
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,820
It will be at your disposal.

355
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:04,586
And a plan of the Calais coach
with the names and locations

356
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,387
- of all the people in it.
- Yes, it will be there.

357
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,622
And the passports of all
the passengers concerned.

358
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,061
Yes, you can even have mine.

359
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:13,259
I go to make a special
announcement now. <i>Grazie</i>.

360
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,701
Bring all the passports
to Monsieur Poirot.

361
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:18,067
Are there any other
passengers on the train?

362
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:22,405
In the Pullman coach,
nobody but myself and Mr. Bianchi.

363
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,382
<i>Alors</i>.

364
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:34,251
Then we must concentrate
on the Calais coach.

365
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:39,987
Where, in my amateur opinion,
the murderer is with us now.

366
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:46,496
Ladies and gentlemen.
Please, please, patience.

367
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,002
You must have patience.
Now, you will all get the chance

368
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:52,369
to state your views to Monsieur Poirot
at his own good time.

369
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:56,012
- Now, please...
- It is not good time. It is bad time.

370
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:59,671
God's laws have been bust,
thou shalt not kill.

371
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:03,081
And why was I not notified at once,
Signor... Mr. Bianchi?

372
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:08,520
- I was his nearest associate.
- And I was nearest to his murderer.

373
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:13,128
You mean you saw the man?
You can identify the murderer?

374
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,957
I mean nothing of the kind.

375
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,895
I mean there was a man
in my compartment last night.

376
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,969
It was pitch-dark, of course,
and my eyes were closed in terror.

377
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:23,105
Then how did you know it was a man?

378
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:27,539
Because I've enjoyed very warm
relationships with both my husbands.

379
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:30,805
- With your eyes closed?
- That helped.

380
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,517
- Excuse me.
- Anyway, the man smelt of tobacco.

381
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,582
Mr. McQueen,
Monsieur Poirot would be grateful

382
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:38,084
for a few minutes of your time.

383
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,714
- Excuse me.
- Don't you agree the man

384
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:44,486
must've entered my compartment
to gain access to Mr. Ratchett?

385
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:48,256
I can think of no other reason,
Madame.

386
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:51,127
Pierre, your passkey.

387
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:53,398
<i>Voilà, monsieur</i>.

388
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:58,769
And will you discreetly procure
me a lady's hatbox,

389
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:01,103
one of the big, old-fashioned kind,

390
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:05,043
perhaps from the
Princess Dragomiroff's maid?

391
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,783
Give me five minutes, doctor.

392
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,953
Mr. McQueen, I regret
to have kept you waiting,

393
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:13,089
but there has been much to establish.

394
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,421
Please be seated. Now,
Mr. McQueen, I should be grateful

395
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:19,221
for anything you can usefully tell me.
What, for example, is?

396
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,661
Let's get just a couple
of things straight first, Mr. Poirot.

397
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:26,199
Who, for example, are you,
and what is your status here?

398
00:43:26,472 --> 00:43:28,302
Excuse me.

399
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:30,598
Monsieur Poirot is a detective,

400
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:33,777
officially delegated to investigate
this case by me.

401
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:37,311
Let us proceed with the matter in
hand. Your relationship with Ratchett?

402
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:38,947
I'm his... I was his secretary.

403
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:40,844
- For how long?
- A year, give or take.

404
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:43,451
- Where did you meet?
- In Persia.

405
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:47,420
He was collecting Gorgan pottery
with considerable success.

406
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,889
And I was trying to collect oil
concessions, you know,

407
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:52,062
with so little success
that I went bankrupt,

408
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:53,889
and he offered me the job. I took it.

409
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:57,829
- And since then?
- Well, we've traveled around.

410
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,866
He was hampered
by not knowing any languages.

411
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,095
I acted more as his courier
than as his secretary.

412
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,933
It was a pleasant enough job.

413
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,201
What part of America
did Ratchett come from?

414
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:09,072
I don't know.

415
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:12,806
The fact is, he never talked
about his background.

416
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:16,180
- Why, do you think?
- Well, I used to...

417
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:19,356
Well, I began to believe
that he had left America

418
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:21,046
to escape something, you know.

419
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:24,854
Or someone. And until a couple
of weeks ago, I think he succeeded.

420
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,290
And then?

421
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,227
Well, he began to get these
anonymous letters,

422
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:32,869
threatening letters, like these.

423
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,502
"I kill killers."

424
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:41,934
"Prepare to die."

425
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:45,776
- How brief.
- But in a sense, how complicated.

426
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:51,085
Last night, I noticed you dispatching
a telegram from Belgrade Station.

427
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,615
That's right.
Let's see, he sent for me

428
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:56,691
to see the text
right after we left Belgrade.

429
00:44:56,894 --> 00:45:00,591
And then he went...
Yeah, it was the last I ever saw of him.

430
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,631
Were there any other
threatening letters?

431
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:06,099
Yeah, but none that
I was allowed to read.

432
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:08,271
He used to... He used to burn them.

433
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:09,970
That explains...

434
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:11,732
What?

435
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,868
My interest in hatboxes.

436
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:22,917
Precisely what I needed.

437
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:26,747
Doctor, first the wounds.

438
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:29,050
- You counted a dozen?
- Yes.

439
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:35,160
Five are deep,
of which three are lethal.

440
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,634
The rest are shallow.

441
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,202
And two...

442
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:45,833
...are so slight as to be
mere scratches.

443
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:47,977
What does that suggest?

444
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:53,980
That there were two murderers,
a strong man and a weak man?

445
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,345
Or a weak woman.

446
00:45:56,553 --> 00:46:01,149
Or a strong man stabbing
the victim both strongly

447
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:05,158
and weakly in order to confuse us.

448
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:09,423
At least we know that
by the time of the murder,

449
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:17,039
Ratchett was too drugged to cry out
or defend himself with this.

450
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,469
But how did you guess?

451
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:22,304
I didn't. He showed it to me
when he offered me $15,000

452
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:25,004
to be his bodyguard and I refused.

453
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:28,216
Ought I to have accepted?

454
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:38,585
Now, let us consider the ashtray.

455
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,492
Two different matches.

456
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:43,598
A smoked cigar.

457
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,031
- A pipe cleaner...
- And this.

458
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,637
- The initial H.
- That should not be hard to identify.

459
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:56,836
I wonder, Christian name or surname?

460
00:46:57,247 --> 00:47:00,216
We must wait until
we examine the passports.

461
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,977
Bianchi, doctor,

462
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:11,390
has it occurred to you that there
are too many clues in this room?

463
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:17,433
Let us proceed by examining what
I hope will prove to be the last of them.

464
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:21,035
The burnt paper.

465
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,134
I use it for the mustaches.

466
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,778
What has that to do
with mustaches?

467
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,006
To melt the wax.

468
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:00,069
Observe, memorize,
you are my only witnesses.

469
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:06,382
- A-l-S-Y A-R-M-S.
- What does that mean?

470
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:13,817
It means we know
the true identity of Mr. Ratchett.

471
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:17,823
And why he had to leave America.

472
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:25,900
Do you remember
the Armstrong case?

473
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:32,371
Of course, the kidnapping of that
little American girl, and the killing.

474
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,804
Who does not?

475
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:37,037
Do you remember the name
of the child?

476
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,841
<i>Certamente</i>. It was Daisy.

477
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,574
D.

478
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:43,946
D-A

479
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:47,419
l-S-Y.

480
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:52,324
Space, A-R-M-S.

481
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:55,157
Daisy Armstrong.

482
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,733
- And Ratchett was her murderer?
- Well, no, the actual murderer

483
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,963
was tried, sentenced
and electrocuted.

484
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:05,403
But he was only the number two.

485
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:09,204
The subordinate of a boss whom,
at first, he was too terrified to identify.

486
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:12,644
Only on the eve of his electrocution
did he give the name of the boss,

487
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:16,307
who by then had disappeared
with the ransom money.

488
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,546
I remember feeling ashamed
that he had an Italian name.

489
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:21,383
Cassetti.

490
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:24,560
<i>Che mostro</i>. He had
a child's blood on his hands.

491
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:28,295
He had worse than that.

492
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:31,899
After the shock
of the body's discovery,

493
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:36,402
Mrs. Armstrong gave premature birth
to a stillborn child,

494
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:39,541
and herself died in the process.

495
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,711
Her husband, Colonel Armstrong,

496
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:45,109
once a brave officer in
the Scots Guard, shot himself,

497
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,647
and Mrs. Armstrong's personal maid,

498
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:51,309
who came wrongly
under suspicion of complicity,

499
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:54,012
threw herself from her
bedroom window and she died,

500
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:56,556
so five deaths, five.

501
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,288
Then I thank heaven that Giuseppe,
who spilt so much blood in his lifetime,

502
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,193
should have his own blood
spilt now.

503
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:22,307
Excellent, Pierre. And could you
summon the passengers to me here?

504
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,249
One by one in this order except
for the Princess Dragomiroff,

505
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:29,949
who is not only of royal blood, but also
much older than she tries not to look.

506
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:36,224
And, Pierre, since you are here
already, we can conveniently start

507
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:38,230
by questioning you.

508
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:42,337
Your full name is Pierre Paul Michel.

509
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,967
- Correct, monsieur.
- Two male saints' names.

510
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,508
You must be greatly blessed.

511
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,772
I've had my share
of good fortune, monsieur.

512
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:55,676
So... And of bad.
I note the cancellation

513
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:59,117
of your wife's photograph
nearly five years ago.

514
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:03,749
- She is deceased.
- She died, monsieur.

515
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:09,622
Of grief at the death
of our only daughter.

516
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,794
From scarlet fever.

517
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:18,139
I am truly sorry.

518
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:24,876
Let us talk of less
distressing matters.

519
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,142
On the night of the murder,
after we left Belgrade,

520
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:31,013
who were the last passengers
to retire to their compartment?

521
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,246
Show me on the diagram.

522
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:37,359
About 1:30, I remember seeing
the English colonel say good night

523
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:41,725
<i>to Mr. McQueen outside</i>
<i>number three and four</i>.

524
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:46,335
<i>I saw him walk back into his</i>
<i>compartment, number 15,</i>

525
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:47,901
<i>which he did not leave</i>.

526
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:51,471
And after that,
did no one reemerge?

527
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:56,071
No, but there was one lady
who opened a door,

528
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,839
I don't know which, and walked

529
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:00,747
<i>in the direction of the toilet</i>

530
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,317
<i>at the far end of the corridor,</i>
<i>next to the dining car</i>.

531
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,614
<i>- Did you see her return?</i>
<i>- No, monsieur</i>.

532
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:09,222
It is possible
I was answering a bell.

533
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:12,592
That reminds me of a final point.

534
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:16,061
Much earlier, soon after 12:30,
you and I both heard Mr. Ratchett

535
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:19,724
ring his bell several times and then
apologize for having had a nightmare.

536
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:31,946
<i>Ce n'est rien</i>.
<i>C'était un cauchemar</i>.

537
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:36,584
Who rang the second bell while
you were answering Mr. Ratchett's?

538
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:39,277
The Princess Dragomiroff, monsieur.

539
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,583
She asked me to summon her maid.

540
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,625
Thank you, Pierre.
That is all for the moment.

541
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:58,939
He had the means to do it.
The passkey to Ratchett's room.

542
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:02,509
- And a knife borrowed from the chef.
- With whom he was in league.

543
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:06,170
Which he plunged repeatedly
and without motive into the body

544
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,078
of his suitably astonished victim.

545
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:13,188
Anyway, we know the door
was not only locked, but chained.

546
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,085
Mr. McQueen.

547
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:16,589
Since our last conversation,

548
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:20,524
I have learned the true identity
of your late employer.

549
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,789
You don't say.

550
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:29,028
Ratchett was, as you yourself
suspected, merely an alias.

551
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:30,763
He was, in fact, Cassetti.

552
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:34,538
The gangster who masterminded
the kidnapping and killing

553
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:36,803
of little Daisy Armstrong.

554
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:39,880
You had no idea of this?

555
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:42,182
Oh, no, sir.

556
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:48,756
If I had, I'd have cut off my right hand
so I couldn't type his lousy letters.

557
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:50,756
And I'd have killed him with my left.

558
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:54,453
You feel you could've done
the good deed yourself?

559
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:59,558
It seems like I'm kind of
incriminating myself.

560
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:01,999
I should be more inclined
to suspect you, Mr. McQueen,

561
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:06,005
if you displayed an inordinate sorrow
at your employer's decease.

562
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:08,143
Sorrow?

563
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:13,814
My dad, my father,
was the district attorney, yeah,

564
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:16,815
who handled the Armstrong case.

565
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,955
Mrs. Armstrong and her husband
came to our house twice

566
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:22,386
for advice about the ransom money.

567
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:26,119
She was gentle and frightened.

568
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:29,956
But not too frightened to take
an interest in a young man

569
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:33,397
who wanted to go on the stage.

570
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:37,263
She even said she'd write to...

571
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,598
She died before
she got around to that.

572
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:42,903
She was as helpful
to me as a...

573
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,041
Well, a mother.

574
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,545
Forgive a Freudian question.

575
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:52,245
- Do you love your mother?
- I did.

576
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:56,016
She died when I was 8.
An impressionable age.

577
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:58,592
- Why do you ask?
- We shared a compartment

578
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,228
on the first night of our journey.

579
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:04,423
You cried out to your mother
twice in your sleep.

580
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,397
Did I?

581
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:09,367
I still dream about her.

582
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:13,037
Go on. Tell me.
I'm emotionally retarded.

583
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:14,676
Tell me that's why
I never married.

584
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:20,180
I am not here to tell you anything,
Mr. McQueen. You are here to tell me.

585
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:25,714
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Yeah, there's just one thing.

586
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,913
How did you...

587
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,786
...figure out Ratchett's identity?

588
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:34,555
By a message found
in his compartment.

589
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:38,259
He'd have burnt that, though,
as I told you.

590
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:40,668
He did.

591
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:43,336
Yeah, he did.

592
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,066
- Then how did you decipher?
- With the help of a hatbox.

593
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:49,507
Thank you, Mr. McQueen.

594
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:57,649
He did it.
He murdered Cassetti.

595
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,378
He practically confessed as much.

596
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:02,620
No, the psychology is wrong.

597
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:06,922
A sensitive, motherless boy
conceives a passion for a lady

598
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:09,860
whom he admires above all
for her gentleness.

599
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:13,502
Now, could McQueen,
admiring the gentleness,

600
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:17,298
commit so foul a murder
without betraying the gentleness

601
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:22,035
of what we might call
his fairy godmother?

602
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,244
Godmother.

603
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:27,905
Now you have accidentally
said something valuable.

604
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:30,786
Come.

605
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:37,452
Mr. Beddoes, this is not
an inquisition, only an inquiry.

606
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:41,027
When you took Mr. Ratchett
his valerian drops

607
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:45,429
about 9:40 yesterday evening,
was he already in bed?

608
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:48,604
That is so, sir. Mr. Ratchett
always retired early on trains.

609
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:51,171
What were your duties before
leaving him for the night?

610
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:53,501
To place the valerian drops
within reach, sir.

611
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:55,438
- Beddoes.
- Sir?

612
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:58,136
Did you put this on my table
during dinner?

613
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:00,612
- No, sir.
- Then who the hell did?

614
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,978
I have no idea, sir.

615
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,748
May I ask what it is?

616
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:06,922
What it is, is none
of your damn business.

617
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:08,488
I wanna know how it got here.

618
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,992
- Will there be anything more, sir?
- There will.

619
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:17,530
Tell Mr. McQueen
I wanna see him, now.

620
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,395
Very well, sir.

621
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,338
At what time would you like
to be called in the morning, sir?

622
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,132
Not before 10.

623
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:26,569
Very good, sir.

624
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:29,543
- Was that usual?
- Oh, quite, sir, yes.

625
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:31,611
His breakfast was his amber moon.

626
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,246
He never rose
until it had had its full effect.

627
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,776
So you instructed Mr. McQueen

628
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:40,080
and then returned
to your own compartment,

629
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,518
the number one and two,

630
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:45,888
whose upper berth was occupied
by Signor Foscarelli.

631
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:48,188
Oh, yes, sir, the Italian person.

632
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:51,367
- Does he speak English?
- A kind of English, sir.

633
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:54,401
I think he learned it
in a place called Chicago.

634
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:56,128
Did you talk together much?

635
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:58,102
Oh, no, sir. I prefer to read.

636
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,138
Hey, what are you reading,
Mr. Beddoes?

637
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:10,908
<i>Love's Captive</i>,
by Mrs. Arabella Richardson.

638
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,849
Is it about sex?

639
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:16,219
No, it's about 10:30, Mr. Foscarelli.

640
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:23,996
I like that.
"It's about 10:30."

641
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:27,498
- And after that you went to sleep.
- Oh, no, sir.

642
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:32,437
Not until 4 in the morning.
Unfortunately, I had the toothache.

643
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,375
- And your companion?
- He snored incessantly.

644
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:35,908
- And your companion?
- He snored incessantly.

645
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:41,215
One final point. How did you come
to be employed by Mr. Ratchett?

646
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:43,476
Through Maibaums, sir,
the big agency in New York.
