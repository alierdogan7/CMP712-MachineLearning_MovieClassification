1
00:01:08,587 --> 00:01:11,852
When I start out
to make a fool of myself...

2
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,422
...there´s very little can stop me.

3
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,591
If I´d known where it would end,
I´d have never let anything start.

4
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,162
If I´d been in my right mind, that is.

5
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:25,358
But once I´d seen her...

6
00:01:25,604 --> 00:01:29,700
...I was not in my right
mind for quite some time.

7
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:38,075
"Good evening," said I,
thinking myself a very gay dog indeed.

8
00:01:38,316 --> 00:01:40,307
But here was a beautiful girl...

9
00:01:40,552 --> 00:01:43,749
...and me with plenty of
time to get myself into trouble.

10
00:01:44,156 --> 00:01:47,125
Some people can smell danger.

11
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,348
Not me.

12
00:01:48,593 --> 00:01:50,993
I asked her
if she´d have a cigarette.

13
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,164
It´s me last one,
so please don´t disappoint me.

14
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,764
But I don´t smoke.

15
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,073
That´s how I found her.

16
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,687
And from that moment on,
I did not use my head very much...

17
00:02:17,923 --> 00:02:20,187
...except to be thinking of her.

18
00:02:21,993 --> 00:02:24,154
But in the park in those days...

19
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:27,957
...the rough young fellas
used to be staging holdups.

20
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,361
Help! Help!

21
00:02:31,436 --> 00:02:33,870
These young fellas
were not professionals.

22
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,298
That´s the reason...

23
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:41,308
...why I start out in
this story a little bit like a hero.

24
00:02:41,713 --> 00:02:43,806
Which I most certainly am not.

25
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:06,403
The cabdriver
woke up, he was okay...

26
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:09,573
...so I borrowed his
carriage to drive the lady home.

27
00:03:09,808 --> 00:03:12,777
In a while she recovered
herself and brightened up...

28
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:16,970
...what with the things I told
her to get her mind off the scare...

29
00:03:17,215 --> 00:03:21,618
...and to set her thinking as well of
the brave fella that had rescued her.

30
00:03:21,987 --> 00:03:23,454
Rosalie.

31
00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:27,055
Fair Rosalie. It´s a name
I´m after calling you. Why not?

32
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:29,886
It´s a gorgeous, romantic
little name entirely.

33
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:32,790
-I´m Michael, a poor sailor...
-You´re a character.

34
00:03:33,031 --> 00:03:37,297
...with the princess of
Central Park riding along at his side.

35
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:41,767
I want to know where
does the princess come from?

36
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,672
I don´t know why
she should tell you but...

37
00:03:45,844 --> 00:03:50,338
Well, her parents
were Russian, quite Russian.

38
00:03:50,582 --> 00:03:52,277
You never heard of the place she´s from.

39
00:03:52,517 --> 00:03:56,351
-Would Your Highness care to gamble?
-She´s done it for a living.

40
00:03:56,588 --> 00:03:59,022
I bet you I´ve been
to the place you were born.

41
00:03:59,257 --> 00:04:01,350
-Cheefoo.
-It's on the China coast.

42
00:04:01,593 --> 00:04:03,083
It´s the second wickedest city.

43
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:05,296
-What´s the first?
-Macao.

44
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,431
-I worked there.
-You worked in Macao?

45
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:12,034
Here´s your dollar. How
about Shanghai? I worked there too.

46
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,965
-As a gambler?
-Well...

47
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:16,435
Hope you were luckier than tonight.

48
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:19,942
You need more than luck in Shanghai.

49
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:21,440
-Do you know what?
-What?

50
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,945
I bet I could drive the cart
from down there inside with you.

51
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:28,379
There´s a police
car on the other road.

52
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,386
We best get out of the park. It´s
too simple for the cops to find us.

53
00:04:32,624 --> 00:04:33,750
You don´t like them.

54
00:04:33,992 --> 00:04:37,428
The cops struggle along
without our doing their work for them.

55
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:44,323
Watch where you´re going!
Get that nag out of here!

56
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:48,935
Now the cops are bound to pick us up.

57
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:51,404
We´d best leave the cab here and walk.

58
00:04:51,643 --> 00:04:53,804
-You don´t like the police.
-I do not.

59
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:56,536
My car´s right there
in the garage, anyway.

60
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,777
Tell me, Michael, is there some
reason why the police don´t like you?

61
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:06,479
Well, they never
put me in jail in America.

62
00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:10,456
You know, the nicest jails are in
Australia, the worst are in Spain.

63
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:12,822
What law did you break in Spain?

64
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:14,725
I killed a man.

65
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:19,529
Just now you almost killed a girl.

66
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:21,136
Is there a law against that?

67
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:23,034
Try it, you won´t like the jails.

68
00:05:23,274 --> 00:05:26,072
They put you in jail for murder?
I didn´t think so.

69
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:28,506
A man killed his
wife in Frisco last week.

70
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:31,045
She´d gone to the icebox for supper.

71
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:35,981
He thought she was a burglar, he said.
He shot her five times in the head.

72
00:05:36,354 --> 00:05:39,187
-He had a good lawyer.
-Evidently. I saw his picture.

73
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:40,857
-Bainbridge.
-Bannister.

74
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:44,926
Arthur Bannister. It said he´s
the world´s greatest criminal lawyer.

75
00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:47,393
-Some people think he is.
-Here´s your car.

76
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,266
Send the bill to my husband.

77
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:56,938
If you´re a sailor, there´s a job for
you. Would you like to work for me?

78
00:05:58,843 --> 00:06:00,208
I´d like it.

79
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:08,652
I´m shipping out tomorrow.

80
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:11,913
So are we! To the West
Coast, by way of the Canal.

81
00:06:12,157 --> 00:06:14,057
We´re short a man on the crew.

82
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:21,896
I´ll make it worth your while.

83
00:06:24,335 --> 00:06:26,303
Could it be this you´re looking for?

84
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:31,399
You were smart to carry
a gun, traveling alone in the park...

85
00:06:31,643 --> 00:06:36,171
...but if you knew you had the gun
in your bag, why throw away the bag?

86
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:40,675
I meant for you to find it.
I don´t know how to shoot.

87
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,147
It´s easy.

88
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:44,716
You just pull the trigger.

89
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:57,694
Some dame, ain´t she?

90
00:06:57,936 --> 00:07:00,461
Yeah. And some car.

91
00:07:00,705 --> 00:07:02,730
Evening, Mr. Grisby.

92
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:07,473
Mr. Bannister sent it
all the way from San Francisco.

93
00:07:07,712 --> 00:07:09,111
So she could have it here.

94
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:11,781
-Bannister?
-Arthur Bannister, himself.

95
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:15,975
Gee, some guys have all the luck.

96
00:07:16,988 --> 00:07:20,685
Personally, I don´t like
a girlfriend to have a husband.

97
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:24,122
If she´ll fool a husband,
I figure she´ll fool me.

98
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:26,956
New York is not as big
as it pretends to be...

99
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:30,326
...so I spent the next
day in the hiring hall...

100
00:07:30,568 --> 00:07:32,195
...waiting for a ship.

101
00:07:32,437 --> 00:07:35,235
That way, big boob that I am...

102
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:37,507
...I thought I could escape her.

103
00:07:37,742 --> 00:07:39,403
S.S. American Trader...

104
00:07:39,644 --> 00:07:42,545
Cigarettes will stunt
your growth. Come here!

105
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,441
Excuse me.

106
00:07:44,682 --> 00:07:49,016
I wonder if you could
help me locate a Mr. O´Hara.

107
00:07:49,254 --> 00:07:50,312
Michael O´Hara.

108
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:52,045
Mike O´Hara?

109
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:54,655
You mean Black Irish that talks fancy?

110
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:57,691
-I don´t know him myself but...
-Black Irish?

111
00:07:57,929 --> 00:08:02,628
Yeah, I know him. Joe, call Mike
O´Hara, a guy here wants to see him.

112
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,836
Michael O´Hara, please
step to the bulletin board.

113
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,004
A man wants to see you.

114
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:11,067
-Shipmates?
-We was in Spain together.

115
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:15,943
They started calling him Black Irish
after what he did to finks back in ´39.

116
00:08:16,181 --> 00:08:19,309
Mike´s got blarney, but he
can hurt a man when he gets mad.

117
00:08:21,186 --> 00:08:22,881
You were asking for me?

118
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:26,146
-O´Hara?
-O´Hara.

119
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:28,819
You´re what they call
an able-bodied seaman?

120
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,391
That´s what they call it.

121
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:33,119
-You ever work on a yacht?
-No.

122
00:08:33,364 --> 00:08:36,891
-I presume you can handle a speedboat.
-I presume so.

123
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:38,329
Do you drink?

124
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:40,161
I beg your pardon?

125
00:08:40,405 --> 00:08:42,168
I asked you if you drink.

126
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:47,300
Whatever´s set in front of me. Doesn´t
have to be wholesome, just strong.

127
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:50,410
Do you drink habitually?

128
00:08:50,648 --> 00:08:53,481
May I ask, mister,
if you´re extending an invitation?

129
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:59,449
I guess it might as well be.

130
00:08:59,691 --> 00:09:01,921
If you´ll show me to the nearest bar...

131
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,152
...we´ll sit down and
discuss your coming to work for me.

132
00:09:05,396 --> 00:09:07,023
My name is Bannister.

133
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:09,565
Bannister.

134
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,370
Me boys, may I present
Mr. Arthur Bannister.

135
00:09:14,606 --> 00:09:17,074
The world´s greatest criminal lawyer.

136
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:19,799
-This is Jake Bjoronson and...
-Hi.

137
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:20,840
...Goldie, right?

138
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:22,137
Hi, I´m Goldfish...

139
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,840
Mr. Bannister´s wife sent him to get
me, isn´t that right, Mr. Bannister?

140
00:09:27,785 --> 00:09:31,277
Now, Mr. Bannister is
gonna buy us all a few drinks...

141
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:35,288
...while I entertain myself
by refusing to go to work for him.

142
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,635
You know, Mike saved my wife´s life.

143
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:54,403
Here, would you mind
inserting these coins? Number four.

144
00:09:54,646 --> 00:09:56,375
That´s all we like to hear.

145
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:02,679
Mike´s quite a hero.

146
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:06,449
Quite a tough guy.

147
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:09,489
Mister, there ain´t no such thing.

148
00:10:10,828 --> 00:10:12,659
No such thing as...

149
00:10:14,032 --> 00:10:15,124
...tough guy?

150
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,192
What´s a tough guy?

151
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:21,304
I don´t know.

152
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:23,803
A guy with an edge.

153
00:10:24,042 --> 00:10:26,772
What makes him sing better
than me? Something in here.

154
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:30,344
What makes it loud?
A microphone. That´s his edge.

155
00:10:30,581 --> 00:10:33,209
-Edge?
-A gun, a nightstick or a razor.

156
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:35,248
Something the other guy ain´t got.

157
00:10:35,486 --> 00:10:39,889
An extra reach on a punch, instead of
brass knuckles, a stripe on a sleeve...

158
00:10:40,124 --> 00:10:42,957
...a badge that says "cop"
on it, a rock in your hand...

159
00:10:43,194 --> 00:10:45,492
...or a bankroll in your pocket.

160
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,357
That´s an edge, brother.

161
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:51,295
Without an edge,
there ain´t no tough guy.

162
00:10:51,969 --> 00:10:55,405
-You hear that, Black Irish?
-It's true.

163
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,800
Well...

164
00:10:58,176 --> 00:11:00,007
...bear it in mind.

165
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:07,584
Yeah, but what makes
him sing prettier than you?

166
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:14,352
Naturally, someone
had to take Mr. Bannister home.

167
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:17,493
I told myself
I couldn´t leave a helpless man...

168
00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:20,493
...lying unconscious in a saloon.

169
00:11:20,732 --> 00:11:23,667
Well, it was me
that was unconscious...

170
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:28,634
...and he was exactly
as helpless as a sleeping rattlesnake.

171
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:35,877
Say, it´s nice of you, Michael, to
be so nice to me while I was so drunk.

172
00:11:47,258 --> 00:11:48,589
Lover!

173
00:11:48,826 --> 00:11:50,191
I wasn´t sure you´d come.

174
00:11:50,695 --> 00:11:51,992
I´m not staying.

175
00:11:53,097 --> 00:11:55,088
You´ve got to stay.

176
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:57,424
Lover!

177
00:12:00,905 --> 00:12:02,873
It´s gonna be a real nice cruise.

178
00:12:03,107 --> 00:12:05,905
First, the Panama Canal,
then up the Mexican coast.

179
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,746
We need a boatswain,
Danny-boy. Ever done any sailing?

180
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:12,506
A bit of it. I saw you
last night at the garage.

181
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,342
Somebody else, Danny-boy.

182
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:15,778
Not me.

183
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,987
Don´t go.

184
00:12:17,221 --> 00:12:18,848
She needs you bad.

185
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,022
You stay.

186
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:24,092
If you play your cards right,
we can get a job for the both of us.

187
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:26,023
I think we´ll take it.

188
00:12:36,474 --> 00:12:40,968
And what was I, Mike
O´Hara, doing on a luxury yacht...

189
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:44,272
...pleasure-cruising
in the sunny Caribbean Sea?

190
00:12:44,749 --> 00:12:47,775
Well, it´s clear now,
I was chasing a married woman.

191
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:51,446
But that´s not the way
I wanted to look at it. No.

192
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:55,523
To be a real prize
fathead like Mike O´Hara...

193
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,561
...you´ve got to swallow all the lies
you can think up to tell yourself.

194
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:08,666
Our little expedition spent
some weeks in the West Indies.

195
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:12,637
Dawdling around, seeing
the sights, laying in supplies...

196
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:15,937
...and getting into more trouble.

197
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:49,610
Hi!

198
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:52,441
Hi, onboard the Cerce!

199
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:54,307
You there!

200
00:13:55,887 --> 00:13:57,912
Why don´t you go swimming?

201
00:13:59,357 --> 00:14:00,949
I beg your pardon?

202
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:04,394
I say, why don´t you go swimming?

203
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:07,223
I didn´t bring a swimming
suit along on the job, sir.

204
00:14:07,465 --> 00:14:08,727
You ought to the next time.

205
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:10,934
There won´t be
a next time. I´m quitting.

206
00:14:11,636 --> 00:14:13,069
My trunks ought to fit you.

207
00:14:13,304 --> 00:14:14,896
You´ll find them in the locker.

208
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:17,232
I suppose you´re wondering who I am.

209
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:18,772
I saw you in New York.

210
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,274
I flew in this morning,
by way of Havana.

211
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:24,140
I´m George Grisby, you know.
Grisby & Bannister.

212
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:27,010
-Where is everybody, gone ashore?
-Almost everybody.

213
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:29,082
My partner too? Mr. Bannister?

214
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,048
That´s right.

215
00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:31,915
And the lady?

216
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:33,988
Oh...

217
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:44,859
Mr. Bannister tells me
you once killed a man.

218
00:14:45,202 --> 00:14:48,171
-You are Michael, aren´t you?
-That´s right.

219
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:50,874
I´m very interested in murders.

220
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:52,905
Forgive me if I seem inquisitive...

221
00:14:53,744 --> 00:14:55,769
-...but where´d it happen?
-At Murcia.

222
00:14:56,013 --> 00:14:57,503
How´d you do it?

223
00:14:57,949 --> 00:14:59,780
No, let me guess.

224
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:02,645
You did it with your hands, didn´t you?

225
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:05,481
Does it ever bother you
when you think about it?

226
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,748
What did he do to you?

227
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:09,222
Nothing.

228
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,928
You just killed him
for the fun of it, eh?

229
00:15:12,396 --> 00:15:14,921
He was a Franco spy.
There was a war at the time.

230
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,260
Then it wasn´t murder, I suppose.

231
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:21,470
Tell me, would you do it again?

232
00:15:23,374 --> 00:15:25,274
Would you mind killing another man?

233
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,603
I´d kill another Franco spy.

234
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:33,450
I was on a pro-Franco committee,
fella, during the Spanish War.

235
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:36,486
Would you kill me
if I gave you the chance?

236
00:15:36,721 --> 00:15:38,586
I may give you the chance.

237
00:15:38,956 --> 00:15:40,514
Michael!

238
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,357
Michael!

239
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:44,891
Before Li went ashore,
did he make lunch?

240
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:47,359
-Yes, ma´am.
-ls there enough for two?

241
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:50,231
I don´t know. Why don´t
you ask Mrs. Bannister?

242
00:15:50,468 --> 00:15:51,526
You ask her.

243
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:53,930
Would you like
a good paste in the eye?

244
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:03,271
I wish she´d asked me to go swimming.

245
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,087
She´ll ask you.

246
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,686
You wait and see.

247
00:16:22,466 --> 00:16:23,364
Will you help me?

248
00:16:35,112 --> 00:16:36,739
Give me a cigarette.

249
00:16:38,783 --> 00:16:40,512
I´m learning to smoke now.

250
00:16:42,286 --> 00:16:44,652
Ever since that night in the park...

251
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,349
...I´ve been getting the habit.

252
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,924
Do all rich women
play games like this?

253
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,425
Call me Rosalie.

254
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:23,957
-I didn´t think you would do that.
-I didn´t either.

255
00:17:26,664 --> 00:17:28,256
You´re scared, aren´t you?

256
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:29,997
You´re scared.

257
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,262
I´m scared too.

258
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:40,772
Methinks you needed me to help you.

259
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:45,547
Sure, if you need
anything, you help yourself.

260
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:47,751
I´m not what you think I am.

261
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:50,146
I just try to be like that.

262
00:17:50,621 --> 00:17:52,179
Keep on trying...

263
00:17:52,523 --> 00:17:54,047
...you might make it.

264
00:17:57,528 --> 00:17:58,927
Oh, Michael.

265
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:03,029
What are we scared of?

266
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,404
So long, kiddies!

267
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,700
Now he knows about us.

268
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:16,603
I wish I did.

269
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:22,078
Bye-bye!

270
00:18:30,494 --> 00:18:31,654
Michael.

271
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:32,725
Yes, sir.

272
00:18:32,963 --> 00:18:35,056
Mr. Grisby has
just told me something...

273
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:37,927
...I´m very sorry to hear.

274
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:41,229
Lover, this concerns you
more than anyone else.

275
00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:44,270
Don´t take your arms...

276
00:18:45,276 --> 00:18:47,107
...away

277
00:18:47,511 --> 00:18:51,277
According to George here,
Michael is anxious to quit.

278
00:18:51,515 --> 00:18:55,042
Comes a change in weather

279
00:18:55,286 --> 00:18:58,255
-Did you know about that, lover?
-No, I didn´t.

280
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:02,616
Shut up, George. What´s
the matter, the hours too long?

281
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,021
-No, sir.
-How about the money?

282
00:19:05,262 --> 00:19:06,559
I don´t care about that.

283
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:09,960
Money doesn´t interest you.
Are you independently wealthy?

284
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:11,065
I´m independent.

285
00:19:11,302 --> 00:19:12,599
Of money?

286
00:19:13,103 --> 00:19:16,869
Before you start that novel,
you better learn something.

287
00:19:17,107 --> 00:19:20,372
You traveled around the world
too much to find out about it.

288
00:19:20,611 --> 00:19:21,543
That´s good.

289
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,072
Well, sir...

290
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:26,906
...I´ve always found
it sanitary to be broke.

291
00:19:27,151 --> 00:19:28,846
That´s good too, Arthur.

292
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,348
Shut up, George.

293
00:19:31,655 --> 00:19:36,251
Money cannot bring you health
and happiness, et cetera, is that it?

294
00:19:38,062 --> 00:19:41,463
Without money, I´d be flat
on my back in a county hospital.

295
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:44,862
Look at this yacht.
It once belonged to Jules Bachrach...

296
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:49,801
...who kept me out of his club because
my mother was a Manchester Greek.

297
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,029
I got him on perjury.

298
00:19:52,142 --> 00:19:54,406
He died bankrupt, and here I am.

299
00:19:54,645 --> 00:19:55,873
George.

300
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:58,741
-Each has his idea of happiness...
-Light this for me.

301
00:19:58,983 --> 00:19:59,813
I´ve got no match.

302
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,382
...but money is what
all of us have in common.

303
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,817
Take Bessie, here.
She used to work for Bachrach.

304
00:20:06,056 --> 00:20:08,889
-I pay her more, don´t I?
-Yes, Mr. Bannister.

305
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:11,117
Her salary means happiness.

306
00:20:11,362 --> 00:20:12,852
It means a home.

307
00:20:13,097 --> 00:20:15,190
Three rooms for two families.

308
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:18,128
She´s a grandmother and
a widow and only one boy works.

309
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:19,495
-lsn´t that right?
-Yes.

310
00:20:19,737 --> 00:20:20,999
Yes, of course it is.

311
00:20:21,238 --> 00:20:23,729
So Bessie goes
to church every Sunday...

312
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:28,809
...and prays to God she´ll never be
too old to earn the salary I pay her.

313
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:35,641
You call yourself independent.

314
00:20:36,754 --> 00:20:40,246
-Come and see me five years from now.
-Aye-aye, sir.

315
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:46,526
Sing it for us again, lover.

316
00:20:48,232 --> 00:20:51,292
Why do you stand for that?
I´m quitting. Why don´t you?

317
00:20:51,535 --> 00:20:53,400
You heard him, I need the money!

318
00:20:53,637 --> 00:20:56,504
Talk of money and murder.
I must be insane...

319
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,367
...or these people are lunatics.

320
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:00,167
That´s why I can´t leave.

321
00:21:00,411 --> 00:21:02,276
That poor little child he married...

322
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,708
...somebody´s got to take care of her.

323
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:09,477
Please don´t hold me

324
00:21:10,387 --> 00:21:14,323
But if you hold me

325
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:19,018
Don´t take your arms

326
00:21:20,064 --> 00:21:21,827
Away

327
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:28,660
Comes a change in weather

328
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:32,342
Comes a change of heart

329
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,077
And who knows when

330
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,611
The rain will start

331
00:21:43,787 --> 00:21:46,119
So I beg you

332
00:21:46,523 --> 00:21:50,960
Please don´t love me

333
00:21:52,096 --> 00:21:55,293
But if you love me

334
00:21:57,301 --> 00:22:01,067
Then don´t take your lips

335
00:22:01,805 --> 00:22:04,239
Or your arms

336
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:07,308
Or your love

337
00:22:08,712 --> 00:22:11,840
Away

338
00:22:15,452 --> 00:22:16,248
Rub

339
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:20,323
Rub Glosso Lusto in your hair

340
00:22:20,557 --> 00:22:22,320
Keep it Glosso Lusto bright

341
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,161
G-L-O double-S-O
L-U-S-T-O

342
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:30,025
Is right
Glosso Lusto

343
00:22:31,735 --> 00:22:35,000
So remember, ladies, use Glosso Lusto.

344
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:37,002
Pleases your hair.

345
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:39,607
Pleases the man you love.

346
00:22:39,843 --> 00:22:41,242
Will you help me?

347
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:47,713
Love. Do you believe
in love at all, Mrs. Bannister?

348
00:22:50,187 --> 00:22:51,518
Give me the wheel.

349
00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:04,925
I was taught to think
about love in Chinese.

350
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:09,497
The way a Frenchman
thinks about laughter in French?

351
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:12,302
The Chinese say...

352
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:15,140
...it is difficult
for love to last long...

353
00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:18,576
...therefore, one
who loves passionately...

354
00:23:18,816 --> 00:23:20,909
...is cured of love in the end.

355
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,675
That´s a hard way of thinking.

356
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,547
There´s more to the proverb.

357
00:23:25,522 --> 00:23:27,683
Human nature is eternal...

358
00:23:27,925 --> 00:23:30,985
...therefore, one
who follows his nature...

359
00:23:31,228 --> 00:23:34,959
...keeps his
original nature in the end.

360
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:39,526
Lover.

361
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:40,930
Yes.

362
00:23:41,638 --> 00:23:45,404
Aren´t you glad I talked
Michael into coming along...

363
00:23:45,642 --> 00:23:46,540
...lover?

364
00:23:46,777 --> 00:23:48,768
He must´ve changed his mind about me.

365
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:52,448
Faith, Mr. Bannister.
I´ve already told your wife...

366
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:55,675
...I never make up my mind
about anything at all...

367
00:23:56,553 --> 00:23:58,646
...until it´s over and done with.

368
00:24:07,498 --> 00:24:10,831
I´d like to, but
I can´t deny that Mr. Bannister...

369
00:24:11,068 --> 00:24:14,629
...didn´t try to give his
wife the things she wanted.

370
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:18,740
She´d said once
that she liked picnics.

371
00:24:18,976 --> 00:24:21,342
We were on our way
up the Mexican coast...

372
00:24:21,578 --> 00:24:24,103
...when he decided
to stop and give her one.

373
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:28,407
Well, Mr. Bannister´s picnic party...

374
00:24:28,652 --> 00:24:31,519
...was most typical of him.

375
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:35,187
A lot of trouble
and money went into it...

376
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:38,258
...but it was no more a picnic...

377
00:24:38,495 --> 00:24:41,328
...than Bannister was a man.

378
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:44,264
When you hear what I got for you...

379
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:48,699
Sid, we´ve worked many cases. I´ll
be sorry to make this one the last.

380
00:24:48,939 --> 00:24:51,305
-This is...
-There´s a plot against my life.

381
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:54,033
I´m going to be murdered.
Isn´t that it?

382
00:24:54,278 --> 00:24:55,643
I´m going to be killed.

383
00:24:55,879 --> 00:24:58,347
Why, Sid, don´t you
think I know about it?

384
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:00,516
All about it!

385
00:25:01,318 --> 00:25:02,910
Now leave me alone!

386
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,279
I want to enjoy myself.

387
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:16,050
Michael!

388
00:26:18,695 --> 00:26:22,096
I found out about Broome. I tried
to tell you, he isn´t a steward.

389
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:24,196
-Not a good one.
-He´s a detective.

390
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:28,200
My husband hires him to watch me,
so I´ll never be able to divorce him.

391
00:26:28,438 --> 00:26:31,703
-So he can divorce you.
-He wants to cut me off without a cent.

392
00:26:31,942 --> 00:26:34,172
Does that matter so much?

393
00:26:36,713 --> 00:26:39,181
Sweet, you don´t know
anything about the world.

394
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:42,577
Lately, I´ve been
rounding out my education.

395
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:05,664
I´ll say this much for you, Arthur.
When you give a picnic, it´s a picnic.

396
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:07,836
Time for another?

397
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:10,273
-Arthur.
-Time for another.

398
00:27:10,514 --> 00:27:13,244
-You know what? Michael still insists...
-What?

399
00:27:13,483 --> 00:27:14,814
I beg your pardon?

400
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,546
I said what.

401
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:20,552
Michael still insists on quitting.

402
00:27:20,924 --> 00:27:23,154
-Why shouldn´t he?
-Oh, no.

403
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:26,658
-Arthur ought to make him stay.
-lf he wants to go, let him.

404
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:29,889
But George likes
to have him around, lover.

405
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:34,399
MichaeI´s so big and strong.
Makes a good bodyguard for you.

406
00:27:34,638 --> 00:27:36,162
Isn´t that what you said, George?

407
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:37,737
I don´t need a bodyguard.

408
00:27:37,974 --> 00:27:40,943
-Not even a big, strong one?
-Don´t make another drink.

409
00:27:41,178 --> 00:27:43,146
-With an Irish brogue?
-He´s had enough.

410
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,874
George thinks MichaeI´s falling
for you, and that makes me unhappy.

411
00:27:48,118 --> 00:27:49,517
George hopes...

412
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:51,744
...but George is wrong again.

413
00:27:52,055 --> 00:27:53,352
Now, Arthur...

414
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,617
-I didn´t say anything about them.
-Make me another drink, George.

415
00:27:59,162 --> 00:28:01,653
Another Grisby special, coming up.

416
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:04,890
You know, you´re
a stupid fool, George.

417
00:28:05,469 --> 00:28:10,236
You ought to realize I don´t mind it a
bit if MichaeI´s in love with my wife.

418
00:28:11,308 --> 00:28:12,832
He´s young.

419
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,907
She´s young.

420
00:28:16,513 --> 00:28:18,208
He´s strong.

421
00:28:22,152 --> 00:28:23,619
She´s beautiful.

422
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,155
Sit down, darling.

423
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:33,353
Where´s your sense of humor?

424
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:36,298
I don´t have to listen to you.

425
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:38,626
Oh, yes you do, lover.

426
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:40,729
Now, Arthur...

427
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:43,030
...you leave Elsa alone.

428
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,398
Come to think of it...

429
00:28:46,209 --> 00:28:49,110
...why doesn´t Michael
want to work for us?

430
00:28:50,113 --> 00:28:51,410
Why should he?

431
00:28:53,216 --> 00:28:56,276
Why should anyone want
to live around us?

432
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,115
Where´s your sense of adventure?

433
00:28:59,356 --> 00:29:00,880
Broome!

434
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:05,985
-Excuse me, sir, he´s eating.
-Tell Michael to step over here.

435
00:29:06,229 --> 00:29:07,491
Aye, sir.

436
00:29:12,969 --> 00:29:16,871
Hey, Mike, they want to see you
over there, Mr. Bannister and them.

437
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:31,616
Well, Michael!

438
00:29:32,756 --> 00:29:34,417
Well, Mr. Bannister?

439
00:29:34,658 --> 00:29:38,992
My wife´s lost her sense of humor, and
you´ve lost your sense of adventure.

440
00:29:39,229 --> 00:29:41,857
Sit down and have a drink.
Give him a drink, George.

441
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:44,597
And don´t look so shocked.

442
00:29:45,135 --> 00:29:49,401
Michael may not be in the Social
Register, but then neither are you...

443
00:29:49,639 --> 00:29:50,435
...anymore.

444
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:57,538
Is this what you folks
do for amusement?

445
00:29:57,781 --> 00:30:01,842
Sit around toasting marshmallows
and call each other names?

446
00:30:02,652 --> 00:30:06,213
If you´re so anxious for me
to join the game, I´d be glad to.

447
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,952
I have a few names I´d like
to be calling you myself.

448
00:30:10,193 --> 00:30:12,889
Oh, but, Michael, that isn´t fair.

449
00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:15,757
You´re bound to lose the contest.

450
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:18,593
We´ll have to give you
a handicap, Michael.

451
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:22,133
You should know what
George knows about me...

452
00:30:22,372 --> 00:30:24,738
...if you really want
to call me names.

453
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:25,973
And, Michael...

454
00:30:27,978 --> 00:30:31,880
...if you think George´s
story is interesting...

455
00:30:32,115 --> 00:30:36,415
...you ought to hear the one about
how Elsa got to be my wife.

456
00:30:38,855 --> 00:30:42,450
Do you want me to tell him
what you´ve got on me, Arthur?

457
00:30:46,496 --> 00:30:47,554
Do you know...

458
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:51,164
...once, off the hump of Brazil...

459
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:54,996
...I saw the ocean so darkened
with blood it was black...

460
00:30:55,238 --> 00:30:58,639
...and the sun fainting away
over the lip of the sky.

461
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:00,604
We´d put in at Fortaleza...

462
00:31:00,844 --> 00:31:04,041
...and a few of us had lines out
for a bit of idle fishing.

463
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:06,681
It was me had the first strike.

464
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,649
A shark it was.

465
00:31:09,653 --> 00:31:11,348
Then there was another.

466
00:31:11,588 --> 00:31:13,613
And another shark again.

467
00:31:14,257 --> 00:31:16,817
Till all about, the sea
was made of sharks...

468
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,119
...and more sharks still.

469
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:21,290
And no water at all.

470
00:31:22,232 --> 00:31:25,201
My shark had torn himself
from the hook...

471
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:29,972
...and the scent or maybe the stain it
was, and him bleeding his life away...

472
00:31:30,206 --> 00:31:32,003
...drove the rest of them mad.

473
00:31:32,242 --> 00:31:35,040
Then the beasts took
to eating each other.

474
00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:37,474
In their frenzy...

475
00:31:38,114 --> 00:31:40,548
...they ate at themselves.

476
00:31:41,418 --> 00:31:45,616
You could feel the lust of murder
like a wind stinging your eyes.

477
00:31:46,122 --> 00:31:50,456
And you could smell the death
reeking up out of the sea.

478
00:31:51,728 --> 00:31:53,628
I never saw anything worse...

479
00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:56,622
...until this little picnic tonight.

480
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:58,528
And you know...

481
00:31:59,135 --> 00:32:03,629
...there wasn´t one of them sharks
in the whole crazy pack that survived.

482
00:32:06,109 --> 00:32:07,804
I´ll be leaving you now.

483
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,815
George, that´s the first time...

484
00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:19,749
...anyone ever thought enough
of you to call you a shark.

485
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:24,618
If you were a good lawyer,
you´d be flattered.

486
00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:48,843
-Where´s Mrs. Bannister?
-I´m sure I don´t know, sir.

487
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:52,279
-She adores it here in Acapulco.
-So do I...

488
00:32:52,522 --> 00:32:56,151
It´s nice and quaint, but when are
we gonna get back to Frisco?

489
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:58,224
Mind walking with me, fella?

490
00:32:58,461 --> 00:33:01,157
I know all the best places.
You might enjoy it.

491
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:03,457
I want to make you a proposition.

492
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:19,411
-Beautiful, isn´t it?
-The beach, you mean, or the tourists?

493
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:20,911
Everything.

494
00:33:21,151 --> 00:33:23,051
´Tis a fair face to the land...

495
00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:25,948
...but you can´t hide
the hunger and guilt.

496
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:28,084
It´s a bright, guilty world.

497
00:33:38,301 --> 00:33:41,168
Darling, of course you pay me!

498
00:33:41,404 --> 00:33:43,338
What´s your guess, Michael?

499
00:33:44,207 --> 00:33:45,970
Think the world´s coming to an end?

500
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:49,303
There was a start to the world,
so I guess there´ll be a stop.

501
00:33:54,918 --> 00:33:56,579
It´s coming, you know.

502
00:33:57,654 --> 00:33:58,882
Oh, yeah.

503
00:33:59,222 --> 00:34:00,587
It´s got to come.

504
00:34:03,193 --> 00:34:04,990
First the big cities...

505
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:08,092
...then maybe even this.

506
00:34:08,932 --> 00:34:10,832
It´s just got to come.

507
00:34:11,101 --> 00:34:13,899
I prefer to be somewhere else
when it does.

508
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,364
I will be.

509
00:34:16,072 --> 00:34:19,530
That´s what I need you for,
to see to it that I´m not around.

510
00:34:20,176 --> 00:34:22,337
-How´d you like $5000?
-What?

511
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:25,605
That´s what I said.
$5000, fella.

512
00:34:27,217 --> 00:34:28,912
What do I have to do for it?

513
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:33,282
I´ll fill in the details later.
Meanwhile, think it over, Michael.

514
00:34:33,523 --> 00:34:35,457
Five thousand dollars.

515
00:34:36,526 --> 00:34:37,458
It´s yours.

516
00:34:37,761 --> 00:34:40,195
All you have to do is kill somebody.

517
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,063
Who, Mr. Grisby?

518
00:34:42,298 --> 00:34:44,630
I´m particular who I murder.

519
00:34:46,603 --> 00:34:47,661
Good boy!

520
00:34:52,108 --> 00:34:53,040
You know...

521
00:34:53,276 --> 00:34:55,676
...I wouldn´t like
to kill just anybody.

522
00:34:56,446 --> 00:34:59,108
-ls it someone I know?
-Oh, yeah.

523
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:00,709
But you´ll never guess.

524
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:03,914
-I give up.
-It's me.

525
00:35:05,288 --> 00:35:06,755
I´m perfectly sober, Michael.

526
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:10,619
I´m willing to pay $5000
if the job is well done.

527
00:35:11,261 --> 00:35:14,025
This is a straightforward
business proposition.

528
00:35:15,298 --> 00:35:16,925
I want you to kill me.

529
00:35:18,468 --> 00:35:19,935
So long, fella!

530
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:31,975
Elsa!

531
00:35:48,665 --> 00:35:50,792
-Michael?
-Yes.

532
00:35:52,836 --> 00:35:55,828
-You talked to George yesterday?
-I did.

533
00:35:56,706 --> 00:36:01,040
-Did he say anything about us?
-He´s afraid the world will explode.

534
00:36:01,511 --> 00:36:03,809
He talked about suicide.

535
00:36:13,556 --> 00:36:15,547
I´ve thought of that sometimes.

536
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:17,225
Suicide?

537
00:36:18,628 --> 00:36:20,653
Do you think it´s wrong, Michael?

538
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,327
I don´t know.

539
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:25,766
Would you kill yourself if you had to?

540
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,430
I don´t know.

541
00:36:31,908 --> 00:36:34,809
-I´ve looked at the pills many times...
-Pills?

542
00:36:35,044 --> 00:36:37,808
The ones my husband takes
to kill the pain.

543
00:36:38,848 --> 00:36:42,079
And wondered if enough of them
would kill my pain.

544
00:36:42,318 --> 00:36:44,479
The pain of just being alive?

545
00:36:44,721 --> 00:36:48,657
Mr. Grisby wants to be cured of that
pain. He wants me to cure him.

546
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:52,553
Mr. Grisby wants me
to kill Mr. Grisby.

547
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:56,462
-I´m sure he´s out of his mind.
-He´s not sane.

548
00:36:56,699 --> 00:37:00,328
-Neither is Arthur.
-Arthur can take care of himself.

549
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:04,198
-What do you want?
-Beautiful moon.

550
00:37:04,674 --> 00:37:07,541
Nice night for it,
ain´t it, Mr. O´Hara?

551
00:37:10,713 --> 00:37:12,874
You didn´t answer me, Mr. O´Hara.

552
00:37:13,116 --> 00:37:14,981
Speak when you´re spoken to.

553
00:37:15,218 --> 00:37:18,085
I´d hate to have to report you
to the lady´s husband.

554
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:20,721
I said it´s a nice night for it.

555
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,975
Would you care to dance with me?

556
00:37:56,426 --> 00:37:59,395
Stop crying. I can´t stand
for you to cry.

557
00:37:59,629 --> 00:38:02,189
-You know what Broome´s been doing?
-Spying.

558
00:38:02,432 --> 00:38:04,093
Spying on you.

559
00:38:04,534 --> 00:38:08,026
Sure I´m gonna take you
where there aren´t any spies.

560
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:10,863
-Where?
-A long way off.

561
00:38:11,107 --> 00:38:13,871
-Somewhere to the far places.
-Far places?

562
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:18,945
We´re in one of them now. Running
away doesn´t work. I tried it.

563
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,816
Everything´s bad, Michael.

564
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:24,610
Everything.

565
00:38:24,854 --> 00:38:27,482
You can´t escape it or fight it.
Get along with it.

566
00:38:27,724 --> 00:38:30,124
Deal with it. Make terms.

567
00:38:30,994 --> 00:38:33,861
You´re such a foolish
knight errant, Michael.

568
00:38:34,097 --> 00:38:36,122
You´re big and strong.

569
00:38:36,366 --> 00:38:39,096
You just don´t know
how to take care of yourself.

570
00:38:39,335 --> 00:38:41,735
So how could you take care of me?

571
00:38:41,971 --> 00:38:43,905
Mike! Hey, Mike!

572
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,733
If you´ll pardon me this intrusion...

573
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:50,002
-...there´s a couple of cops out here.
-Cops?

574
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:53,709
I don´t speak their language.

575
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,214
And they wants me to identify this guy.

576
00:38:56,452 --> 00:38:59,421
What´s the Spanish for "drunken bum"?

577
00:39:04,293 --> 00:39:07,626
It was early October when
we made San Francisco...

578
00:39:07,864 --> 00:39:12,494
...and dropped anchor across the bay
from the city, in Sausalito.

579
00:39:12,735 --> 00:39:15,602
It had been a most
interesting cruise.

580
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:18,773
All very rich and rare and strange.

581
00:39:19,008 --> 00:39:21,408
But I had had no stomach for it.

582
00:39:21,644 --> 00:39:25,774
To begin with, living on a hook
takes away your appetite.

583
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:30,309
You´ve no taste for any pleasure
but the one that´s burning in you.

584
00:39:30,553 --> 00:39:32,521
But even without an appetite...

585
00:39:32,755 --> 00:39:37,658
...I´d learned it´s quite amazing
how much a fool like me can swallow.

586
00:39:38,361 --> 00:39:40,522
Please, Michael, be careful.

587
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:45,064
The car´s down there.

588
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:48,731
Mr. Bannister´s waiting to
take you into the city...

589
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:52,202
...to San Francisco,
but you´re not going with him.

590
00:39:53,242 --> 00:39:54,903
You´re going with me.

591
00:39:56,345 --> 00:39:57,676
Michael...

592
00:39:58,848 --> 00:40:00,338
I can take care of you.

593
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:04,485
You think I´d take you to a desert
island to eat berries and goat´s milk.

594
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,120
And I´d have to take in
washing to support you.

595
00:40:07,356 --> 00:40:09,483
Hello, kiddies.

596
00:40:10,293 --> 00:40:12,056
There´s George.

597
00:40:13,863 --> 00:40:16,923
What would you say to $5000
to get us started?

598
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:20,067
We´ve got a date with
a couple of beers, fella.

599
00:40:20,803 --> 00:40:22,737
Arthur was asking for you.

600
00:40:23,372 --> 00:40:25,772
He´d wondered where you´d gone.

601
00:40:27,944 --> 00:40:29,809
I won´t tell him.

602
00:40:32,148 --> 00:40:35,777
-You didn´t answer my question. $5000?
-Goodbye, Michael.

603
00:40:36,486 --> 00:40:38,386
Couldn´t we start on that?

604
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:44,356
Would you have to take in
washing on $5000?

605
00:41:02,812 --> 00:41:04,177
Sit down.

606
00:41:06,315 --> 00:41:09,512
I suppose you wonder what´s behind
my little proposition.

607
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:14,716
None of your business, actually,
but since we´re partners in crime...

608
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:19,892
...I´ll tell you, our firm´s insured
against the death of either partner.

609
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:23,587
That means if one of us dies,
the other will get a lot of money.

610
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:26,893
-Thanks. Now, leave us alone.
-Yes, sir.

611
00:41:27,436 --> 00:41:31,236
Like some other people we both know,
I´m not very happily married.

612
00:41:31,474 --> 00:41:33,203
And another thing, frankly...

613
00:41:33,442 --> 00:41:38,072
...I don´t want to be within 1000
miles of that city or any city...

614
00:41:38,314 --> 00:41:41,681
...when they start
dropping those bombs.

615
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:44,915
There´s been a suggestion
we drive you into town.

616
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:46,849
Want a beer before you go?

617
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:50,149
I´ll be waiting with
Mrs. Bannister in the car.

618
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:54,290
Better meet me in my office.
Make it late tonight.

619
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:55,394
What for?

620
00:41:55,631 --> 00:41:57,292
$5000.

621
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,001
That´ll take a girl and a sailor
on a nice little trip.

622
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:05,367
-I´ll meet you at your office.
-Do.

623
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:07,508
There´s a paper I´d like you to sign.

624
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,303
It´s nothing very binding or important,
really.

625
00:42:10,546 --> 00:42:12,673
Just a confession of murder.

626
00:42:13,683 --> 00:42:14,980
Here´s to crime.

627
00:42:25,962 --> 00:42:28,988
She say meet you at aquarium.
9:00, before people there.

628
00:42:29,232 --> 00:42:30,665
The aquarium?

629
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,094
Oh, uh...

630
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:35,232
...if you ever need
a good lawyer, Michael...

631
00:42:36,205 --> 00:42:37,570
...let me know.

632
00:42:41,611 --> 00:42:44,910
"l, Michael O´Hara, in order
to live in peace with my God...

633
00:42:45,147 --> 00:42:49,106
...do freely make the following
confession. On August 9th..."

634
00:42:49,352 --> 00:42:50,717
That´s tomorrow night.

635
00:42:51,187 --> 00:42:53,485
"...I shot and killed
Mr. George Grisby...

636
00:42:53,723 --> 00:42:55,816
...placing his corpse
in the Sausalito Bay."

637
00:42:56,058 --> 00:42:57,025
Just a minute.

638
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,990
What you´re reading, am I
supposed to have written it?

639
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,620
It´s your confession.

640
00:43:03,032 --> 00:43:05,466
It´s the easiest 5000
you´re ever gonna earn.

641
00:43:05,701 --> 00:43:07,328
Why don´t you do it yourself?

642
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,095
Commit suicide? Me? Don´t be silly.

643
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:14,366
Suicide is against the law.
And we´re not gonna break the law.

644
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:18,171
This is going to be murder,
and it´s going to be legal.

645
00:43:18,414 --> 00:43:21,076
I want to live, but I want to vanish.

646
00:43:21,317 --> 00:43:24,718
I want to go away and change my name
and never be heard of again.

647
00:43:24,954 --> 00:43:28,981
But that costs money.
It isn´t easy nowadays.

648
00:43:29,225 --> 00:43:31,125
If they´re looking, they´ll find you.

649
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,624
Unless they think you´re dead.

650
00:43:33,863 --> 00:43:37,890
They´ll find you even on the smallest
island in the South Seas.

651
00:43:38,534 --> 00:43:40,434
That´s where I´m going to be, fella.

652
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:42,797
On that smallest island.

653
00:43:43,806 --> 00:43:47,435
I´ll mail the rest to you
after the "murder".

654
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:51,407
But I want to live on
that island in peace.

655
00:43:51,981 --> 00:43:56,077
That won´t be possible unless
the world is satisfied I don´t exist.

656
00:43:57,186 --> 00:43:59,518
You know, the law´s
a funny thing, fella.

657
00:44:00,056 --> 00:44:02,650
The state of California
will say I´m dead...

658
00:44:02,892 --> 00:44:04,450
...officially dead...

659
00:44:04,694 --> 00:44:07,128
...if somebody´ll say
they murdered me.

660
00:44:07,663 --> 00:44:09,528
That´s what I´m paying you for.

661
00:44:10,066 --> 00:44:12,296
-To murder you?
-Say you did.

662
00:44:13,135 --> 00:44:15,729
-What happens to you, really?
-I disappear.

663
00:44:15,971 --> 00:44:18,531
-What happens to me?
-Nothing.

664
00:44:19,108 --> 00:44:20,575
That´s the choker.

665
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:23,506
You swear you killed me,
but you can´t be arrested.

666
00:44:23,746 --> 00:44:26,271
That´s the law.
Look it up for yourself.

667
00:44:26,582 --> 00:44:28,482
There´s no such thing as homicide...

668
00:44:28,718 --> 00:44:30,845
...unless they find a corpse.

669
00:44:31,087 --> 00:44:33,817
It just isn´t murder
if they don´t find a body.

670
00:44:34,156 --> 00:44:35,817
According to the law...

671
00:44:36,058 --> 00:44:40,051
...I´m dead if you say
you murdered me.

672
00:44:40,296 --> 00:44:44,198
But you´re not a murderer
unless I´m dead.

673
00:44:45,634 --> 00:44:47,226
Silly, isn´t it?

674
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:55,099
I´ve never seen an aquarium.

675
00:44:56,912 --> 00:44:58,402
Would you show me about?

676
00:45:02,017 --> 00:45:04,212
I couldn´t think where
else we could meet.

677
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,512
-Only tourists come here and children.
-And lovers?

678
00:45:07,757 --> 00:45:09,054
-Oh, Michael.
-Fair Rosalie.

679
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:10,189
-Love me?
-I do.

680
00:45:10,426 --> 00:45:12,656
Do you still want to
take me away with you?

681
00:45:13,062 --> 00:45:14,324
Why do you ask me that?

682
00:45:14,563 --> 00:45:16,997
Will you carry me off
into the sunrise?

683
00:45:17,233 --> 00:45:19,667
I´ll take proper care of you.
You won´t starve.

684
00:45:19,902 --> 00:45:22,462
I don´t care where it is, Michael.

685
00:45:22,772 --> 00:45:24,399
Just take me there.

686
00:45:25,274 --> 00:45:26,366
Take me quick.

687
00:45:28,043 --> 00:45:29,032
Take me.

688
00:45:44,026 --> 00:45:46,620
-Come on, come on.
-Can´t I look? I want to see.

689
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:49,524
I don´t want you to worry...

690
00:45:49,765 --> 00:45:51,198
-I am.
-I have arrangements...

691
00:45:51,434 --> 00:45:54,870
The things you said
yesterday about money.

692
00:45:55,271 --> 00:45:58,001
You didn´t sound like you.

693
00:45:58,607 --> 00:46:01,235
You´re not going to try
anything foolish, are you?

694
00:46:01,777 --> 00:46:04,940
I´m afraid so.
Something very foolish indeed.

695
00:46:09,084 --> 00:46:12,349
"l, Michael O´Hara, in order
to live in peace with my God...

696
00:46:12,588 --> 00:46:14,715
...do freely make the following
confession."

697
00:46:14,957 --> 00:46:18,154
Read the last part.
That explains the whole of it.

698
00:46:22,665 --> 00:46:27,568
"We arrived at the boat landing.
Mr. Grisby heard a suspicious sound.

699
00:46:28,003 --> 00:46:32,872
He was scared of a holdup and asked
me to get the gun out of the car.

700
00:46:33,108 --> 00:46:38,011
I reached in and got the gun, but
it went off by accident in my hand.

701
00:46:38,347 --> 00:46:41,783
And I saw that Mr. Grisby
was all covered with blood.

702
00:46:43,652 --> 00:46:46,553
It took me a minute to realize
that Mr. Grisby was dead.

703
00:46:46,789 --> 00:46:50,122
To realize that I,
Michael O´Hara, had killed him."

704
00:46:52,428 --> 00:46:57,331
But I don´t understand. What were
you doing with George in Sausalito?

705
00:46:57,566 --> 00:47:02,060
It says Mr. Grisby wants to go to the
yacht and asks me to drive him there.

706
00:47:03,005 --> 00:47:04,939
And that´s where I kill him.

707
00:47:05,508 --> 00:47:07,806
With the rough tide in the bay...

708
00:47:08,043 --> 00:47:10,773
...they wouldn´t recover
the body if there was one.

709
00:47:11,747 --> 00:47:13,647
You don´t understand, darling.

710
00:47:13,983 --> 00:47:16,417
He isn´t dead yet. Grisby´s alive.

711
00:47:16,652 --> 00:47:20,918
He won´t be murdered till tonight.
Is that foolish enough for you?

712
00:47:21,156 --> 00:47:23,989
My husband wrote that
and got you to sign it for him.

713
00:47:24,226 --> 00:47:26,717
It´s one of those famous
Bannister tricks.

714
00:47:26,962 --> 00:47:31,865
It´s Grisby´s idea. It seems
Mr. Grisby wants to disappear.

715
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:36,263
And this is a scheme of his
to get himself declared dead.

716
00:47:37,139 --> 00:47:41,303
There´s more to it than that, Michael.
I don´t know what, but there´s more.

717
00:47:41,544 --> 00:47:43,705
It´s a trap of some kind.

718
00:47:46,081 --> 00:47:48,982
You´ll meet George tonight,
just as he arranged.

719
00:47:49,218 --> 00:47:53,086
Go with him to Sausalito and
do whatever he asks you to do.

720
00:47:53,322 --> 00:47:55,847
As long as nobody gets hurt,
it won´t matter.

721
00:47:56,158 --> 00:47:57,989
But don´t let him out of your sight.

722
00:47:58,227 --> 00:48:01,594
Maybe George isn´t as big a fool
as he seems to be, but...

723
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:04,799
...I´ll swear my husband´s
behind this whole thing.

724
00:48:05,935 --> 00:48:09,336
Oh, Michael, why did you let yourself
get dragged into it?

725
00:48:09,572 --> 00:48:13,474
Sure because I´m a fool.
A deliberate, intentional fool.

726
00:48:13,709 --> 00:48:16,303
And that´s the worst kind,
or didn´t you know?

727
00:48:16,545 --> 00:48:20,345
Yes, my beloved. My beloved fool,
I know.

728
00:48:26,889 --> 00:48:30,222
I don´t think anybody´s home,
just Broome.

729
00:48:30,726 --> 00:48:34,321
Mr. Bannister´s in the city, and
Mrs. Bannister went to the movies.

730
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:37,130
Better wait for me in the kitchen.

731
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,693
Make some coffee. We´ll both need it.

732
00:48:40,502 --> 00:48:41,901
I´ve got things to attend to.

733
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:56,039
Well?

734
00:48:56,952 --> 00:49:00,388
I wonder, am I the only one
that´s onto you and her?

735
00:49:00,623 --> 00:49:03,820
Nobody else seems to guess
you´re sweet on her.

736
00:49:04,093 --> 00:49:05,754
That ought to be worth extra.

737
00:49:05,995 --> 00:49:09,055
-I´ll throw it in for the same price.
-What are you selling?

738
00:49:09,298 --> 00:49:11,232
I can shut up,
that´s what I´m selling.

739
00:49:11,634 --> 00:49:14,125
You see, I´m a snoopy kind of a guy.

740
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:15,997
I find things out.

741
00:49:16,338 --> 00:49:17,635
I get around.

742
00:49:18,207 --> 00:49:20,903
I got around one afternoon
in Sausalito.

743
00:49:21,143 --> 00:49:23,168
I overheard a conversation
in Mexico.

744
00:49:23,412 --> 00:49:25,403
I found out about a little plot
of yours.

745
00:49:26,148 --> 00:49:29,606
You wouldn´t want me to say nothing
about you framing Michael.

746
00:49:29,852 --> 00:49:32,082
Frame him for a murder
you´re committing.

747
00:49:32,321 --> 00:49:35,188
Let´s talk it over tomorrow, huh?

748
00:49:35,424 --> 00:49:38,450
When you´ll be playing dead and
somebody else is really dead?

749
00:49:38,694 --> 00:49:43,063
No, thanks, Mr. Grisby.
We´ll settle our account right now.

750
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,033
All right, Broome...

751
00:49:47,603 --> 00:49:49,195
...if you insist.

752
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,489
-What are you doing?
-Oh, hello.

753
00:50:13,729 --> 00:50:15,594
I´m sorry. You drive.

754
00:50:15,831 --> 00:50:17,025
Were you shooting a gun?

755
00:50:17,266 --> 00:50:20,599
Yeah, I was just doing
a little target practice.

756
00:50:21,437 --> 00:50:25,134
That´s what you´ll say when you shoot
the gun, down by the boat landing.

757
00:50:25,374 --> 00:50:27,740
People come out of the bar
to see what happened...

758
00:50:27,976 --> 00:50:30,968
...you´ll say, "I was just doing
a little target practice."

759
00:50:32,047 --> 00:50:34,607
Really, you´re supposed
to have shot me.

760
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:37,216
Later, when nobody´s looking,
you´re supposed...

761
00:50:37,453 --> 00:50:41,150
...to have thrown my corpse
into the bay.

762
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:09,039
Look out!

763
00:51:09,885 --> 00:51:12,046
Hey, what happened back there?

764
00:51:12,287 --> 00:51:13,652
Anybody hurt?

765
00:51:16,992 --> 00:51:19,825
-Kind of banged it up.
-It's our fault, I´m afraid.

766
00:51:20,062 --> 00:51:23,657
-Here´s my card, for the damage.
-Looks like you´ve got damage.

767
00:51:23,899 --> 00:51:26,163
-Your head´s cut bad.
-It's okay, really.

768
00:51:26,401 --> 00:51:29,564
-It's all right, good night.
-Well, good night, Mr. Grisby.

769
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:32,104
-Did he get a good look at us?
-What?

770
00:51:32,341 --> 00:51:33,638
Truck driver, I mean.

771
00:51:33,876 --> 00:51:35,776
-He´ll make a good witness.
-What?

772
00:51:36,011 --> 00:51:38,775
He´ll testify he saw us
just before the murder.

773
00:51:41,917 --> 00:51:44,715
Broome, are you ill?

774
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:48,089
I got some lead in me where it hurts.

775
00:51:48,323 --> 00:51:50,257
-I´ll call a doctor.
-Did already.

776
00:51:50,726 --> 00:51:53,752
The trouble is, the doc
will report to the police.

777
00:51:53,996 --> 00:51:56,965
They´ll want to know who was
the certain party who shot me.

778
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:59,394
Don´t worry, he´ll get his.

779
00:51:59,902 --> 00:52:01,927
There´s gonna be a murder.

780
00:52:02,404 --> 00:52:04,872
Ain´t no fake murder.
Somebody´s gonna be killed.

781
00:52:05,474 --> 00:52:06,600
You mean...?

782
00:52:06,942 --> 00:52:10,571
-Your husband´s gonna be knocked off.
-What?

783
00:52:10,813 --> 00:52:11,871
Could be.

784
00:52:12,281 --> 00:52:16,479
You´d better get down to his office,
if you want to do anything about it.

785
00:52:24,526 --> 00:52:27,654
-What are you doing?
-Getting blood all over the car.

786
00:52:27,896 --> 00:52:28,726
My blood.

787
00:52:28,964 --> 00:52:32,695
It´s perfect. If you shot me,
there would be blood, fella, see.

788
00:52:32,935 --> 00:52:35,460
Now, when you get back
to the garage...

789
00:52:35,704 --> 00:52:39,834
...start washing out the blood stains.
You´re wiping out the evidence, see.

790
00:52:40,075 --> 00:52:44,171
Be careful not to do such a good job
that they can´t analyze the stains.

791
00:52:44,713 --> 00:52:46,237
Just try to wash that out.

792
00:52:46,481 --> 00:52:48,449
Get the gun
from the glove compartment.

793
00:52:48,684 --> 00:52:50,311
Good. Come on now, let´s go.

794
00:52:57,659 --> 00:53:00,025
Let the ones in the bar
get a good look at you.

795
00:53:00,262 --> 00:53:01,786
They´ll ask about the shooting.

796
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:05,090
Just say you´re doing
a little target practice.

797
00:53:07,069 --> 00:53:08,866
Wait until the speedboat gets away.

798
00:53:09,471 --> 00:53:11,336
-Understand?
-Where are you going?

799
00:53:11,573 --> 00:53:12,938
Give me that cap.

800
00:53:13,709 --> 00:53:16,769
-What are you laughing at?
-Wait and see.

801
00:53:52,047 --> 00:53:54,948
Why don´t people let
some people get some sleep?

802
00:53:57,419 --> 00:53:59,319
Somebody said they heard a shot.

803
00:54:02,925 --> 00:54:04,222
Hey, what´s with the gun?

804
00:54:04,459 --> 00:54:07,951
I was just doing a little
target practice.

805
00:54:08,363 --> 00:54:10,160
-Where you going now?
-ls he drunk?

806
00:54:10,399 --> 00:54:11,764
He´s soused!

807
00:54:18,974 --> 00:54:21,568
San Rafael...
San Rafael, please.

808
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:30,414
Hello, I want to speak to
Mrs. Bannister.

809
00:54:30,986 --> 00:54:31,953
What?

810
00:54:32,187 --> 00:54:33,779
It´s me. Broome.

811
00:54:34,189 --> 00:54:36,953
Get down to the office.
Montgomery Street.

812
00:54:37,192 --> 00:54:38,591
You was framed.

813
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:42,261
Grisby didn´t want to disappear.
He just wanted an alibi.

814
00:54:42,497 --> 00:54:43,828
And you´re it.

815
00:54:44,066 --> 00:54:45,431
You´re the fall guy.

816
00:54:45,667 --> 00:54:49,068
Grisby´s gone down there
to kill Bannister now.

817
00:54:49,905 --> 00:54:50,929
Hello!

818
00:54:53,241 --> 00:54:54,230
Hello!

819
00:54:54,876 --> 00:54:55,865
Hello!

820
00:55:07,122 --> 00:55:08,612
Stop that car!

821
00:55:08,857 --> 00:55:09,915
Stop the car!

822
00:55:14,262 --> 00:55:15,229
Am I too late?

823
00:55:15,464 --> 00:55:17,125
-Why don´t you save Bannister?
-Who?

824
00:55:17,366 --> 00:55:20,301
-Who are you?
-Hey, that´s blood, ain´t it?

825
00:55:20,535 --> 00:55:22,628
-Sure, it´s blood.
-It's all over the seat.

826
00:55:22,871 --> 00:55:24,429
Will you let go of me?

827
00:55:25,007 --> 00:55:27,032
-Give us your name!
-Michael O´Hara!

828
00:55:29,111 --> 00:55:31,272
I want to know about Mr. Bannister!

829
00:55:32,614 --> 00:55:35,913
"l, Michael O´Hara, in order
to live at peace with my God..."

830
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:37,550
Yes, Michael?

831
00:55:39,388 --> 00:55:41,219
-You were asking for me?
-Pardon me.

832
00:55:41,456 --> 00:55:43,788
"...do freely make the following
confession...

833
00:55:44,026 --> 00:55:48,793
...on the evening of August 9th,
I shot and killed George Grisby."

834
00:55:49,798 --> 00:55:51,663
You weren´t killed. It was Grisby.

835
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,460
Hello, darling.
Have you heard the news?

836
00:55:54,703 --> 00:55:56,136
George has been murdered.

837
00:55:56,371 --> 00:56:00,000
He was found here on the street
with MichaeI´s cap in his hand.

838
00:56:01,176 --> 00:56:03,906
Michael is going to need
a good lawyer.

839
00:56:07,082 --> 00:56:08,572
Well, it´s my own fault...

840
00:56:08,817 --> 00:56:12,617
...but that´s how I got into it,
big boob that I am.

841
00:56:12,854 --> 00:56:16,153
I began to ask myself if
I wasn´t out of my head entirely.

842
00:56:16,391 --> 00:56:18,450
The wrong man was arrested.

843
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,489
The wrong man was shot.

844
00:56:21,029 --> 00:56:24,192
Grisby was dead and so was Broome.

845
00:56:24,566 --> 00:56:26,761
And what about Bannister?

846
00:56:27,235 --> 00:56:31,069
He was going to defend me
in a trial for my life.

847
00:56:31,306 --> 00:56:35,470
And me charged with a couple
of murders I did not commit.

848
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:39,441
Either me or the rest of the whole
world is absolutely insane.

849
00:56:44,886 --> 00:56:49,118
You know my associate Mr. Sealy, dear.
He´s arranged for your jail pass.

850
00:56:49,357 --> 00:56:51,348
It´s in this building.
Shall he take you?

851
00:56:51,593 --> 00:56:54,562
-I´ll go by myself.
-Sealy, I´ll join you in the office.

852
00:56:54,796 --> 00:56:58,163
Okay, Mr. Bannister.
Excuse me, Mrs. Bannister.

853
00:57:01,369 --> 00:57:03,234
You want to be alone with Michael.

854
00:57:03,472 --> 00:57:05,269
-It's your idea.
-Morning, Bannister.

855
00:57:05,507 --> 00:57:07,873
Morning, judge.
Your boy still in the hospital?

856
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:10,601
-Been home since Tuesday.
-That´s fine, judge.

857
00:57:10,846 --> 00:57:12,643
-Was it...
-What´s that, lover?

858
00:57:12,881 --> 00:57:15,611
-Oh, I beg your pardon.
-Wasn´t it your idea?

859
00:57:15,851 --> 00:57:18,979
Isn´t it your idea to save Michael
from the gas chamber?

860
00:57:19,254 --> 00:57:22,655
-Aren´t we the only ones who can?
-What do you think? Galloway.

861
00:57:22,891 --> 00:57:26,850
-Hi, Bannister. How´s tricks?
-You know our district attorney, dear.

862
00:57:27,095 --> 00:57:29,495
-How do you do...
-Mrs. Bannister. Fasbender...

863
00:57:29,731 --> 00:57:32,791
I was the murdered man´s partner.
The other was my servant.

864
00:57:33,034 --> 00:57:37,767
If I defend Michael, any jury is going
to figure I believe he´s innocent.

865
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:42,071
And you have reason to believe
that Michael is innocent?

866
00:57:47,282 --> 00:57:49,876
I hear that Galloway
is going to say...

867
00:57:50,118 --> 00:57:53,952
...that Michael took George´s body
into the city in our speedboat.

868
00:57:54,456 --> 00:57:57,050
-But we can prove...
-Prove? He couldn´t have.

869
00:57:57,292 --> 00:57:58,554
-Why not?
-How´d he get back?

870
00:57:58,793 --> 00:58:00,784
-Back where?
-To the yacht, naturally.

871
00:58:01,029 --> 00:58:03,190
The boat couldn´t have driven itself.

872
00:58:03,431 --> 00:58:07,265
Or maybe it was George´s ghost.
Maybe the boat just drifted back.

873
00:58:07,636 --> 00:58:08,728
Now, lover...

874
00:58:09,004 --> 00:58:11,404
...Michael has to plead
excusable homicide.

875
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,665
But you can prove it wasn´t his gun.

876
00:58:13,909 --> 00:58:16,673
They know it wasn´t
MichaeI´s gun that killed George.

877
00:58:16,912 --> 00:58:19,676
The gun that did kill George
can´t be found, lover.

878
00:58:19,915 --> 00:58:22,645
So we can´t prove that Michael
didn´t shoot him.

879
00:58:22,884 --> 00:58:26,012
And it was MichaeI´s gun
that killed Broome.

880
00:58:27,389 --> 00:58:28,651
Now...

881
00:58:29,191 --> 00:58:32,683
...Michael is going to need
everything that the greatest...

882
00:58:32,928 --> 00:58:35,362
...living trial lawyer can do for him.

883
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:39,732
Our good district attorney there
has worked up a beautiful case.

884
00:58:39,968 --> 00:58:44,598
The truck driver, the saloonkeeper.
They´ll be effective witnesses.

885
00:58:44,839 --> 00:58:49,242
And he´ll know how to handle them.
And then there´s the crazy confession.

886
00:58:49,477 --> 00:58:51,672
But Michael has an explanation.

887
00:58:53,148 --> 00:58:54,877
-Explanation?
-You think it´s funny.

888
00:58:55,116 --> 00:58:56,140
Funny?

889
00:58:56,952 --> 00:58:59,921
That story about how George
hired Michael to kill George?

890
00:59:00,155 --> 00:59:03,420
-To pretend to kill him.
-Really?

891
00:59:04,526 --> 00:59:07,051
Why would George want to disappear?

892
00:59:07,295 --> 00:59:10,787
-He mentioned partnership insurance.
-What?

893
00:59:11,032 --> 00:59:14,001
-Partnership insurance.
-Which George wanted to collect?

894
00:59:14,236 --> 00:59:17,399
And George wanted everybody
to think he was dead?

895
00:59:18,907 --> 00:59:21,899
Dead, so that he could collect
the insurance?

896
00:59:24,379 --> 00:59:26,779
Well, if he was dead,
how could he collect?

897
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:29,178
Now, lover...

898
00:59:29,751 --> 00:59:34,211
...if your Irishman doesn´t want to
die, he´s going to have to trust me.

899
00:59:34,923 --> 00:59:35,981
But you...

900
00:59:36,758 --> 00:59:38,225
...do you trust him?

901
00:59:39,828 --> 00:59:41,921
I wouldn´t trust him with my wife.

902
00:59:44,332 --> 00:59:47,324
You want to make sure he doesn´t
get off, don´t you?

903
00:59:48,436 --> 00:59:51,030
I´ve never lost a case, remember?

904
00:59:52,607 --> 00:59:54,234
Besides...

905
01:00:03,251 --> 01:00:05,879
...my wife might think
he was a martyr.

906
01:00:07,389 --> 01:00:09,084
I´ve got to defend him.

907
01:00:10,125 --> 01:00:12,184
I haven´t any choice.

908
01:00:14,462 --> 01:00:16,225
And neither have you.

909
01:00:25,507 --> 01:00:26,769
Hello.

910
01:00:27,609 --> 01:00:30,601
It looks bad for me,
isn´t that what your husband says?

911
01:00:31,646 --> 01:00:34,479
Whatever else he is,
Arthur´s a marvelous lawyer.

912
01:00:34,716 --> 01:00:35,842
You´ve got to trust him.

913
01:00:36,084 --> 01:00:39,918
-Why? Why should I trust him?
-Because it´s your only chance.

914
01:00:42,457 --> 01:00:44,618
Because I want you to.

915
01:00:45,093 --> 01:00:47,027
That´ll have to do for a reason.

916
01:00:47,262 --> 01:00:48,456
Michael...

917
01:00:49,431 --> 01:00:50,955
-Why did you kill Broome?
-What?

918
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:53,292
Don´t be afraid to tell me.
I want to know.

919
01:00:53,535 --> 01:00:56,402
Grisby killed Broome. He was
going to murder your husband.

920
01:00:56,638 --> 01:00:57,969
-George kill Arthur?
-You know that.

921
01:00:58,206 --> 01:00:59,798
What could he gain from it?

922
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:01,975
For one thing, he couldn´t
get a divorce.

923
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:05,737
If people thought he was dead,
he could get away from his wife.

924
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:07,777
-Wife? But that´s impossible.
-Why?

925
01:01:09,484 --> 01:01:11,418
George didn´t have a wife.

926
01:01:12,687 --> 01:01:14,518
He wasn´t married.

927
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:34,106
Mrs. Bannister, I saved
a seat for youse.

928
01:01:34,342 --> 01:01:36,537
Would youse gentlemen
please move over?

929
01:01:39,948 --> 01:01:42,041
-Sit down.
-I just wanted to look at her.

930
01:01:42,283 --> 01:01:43,375
I object!

931
01:01:43,618 --> 01:01:47,645
The question calls for the operation
of the officer´s mind.

932
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:49,357
Sustained.

933
01:01:49,591 --> 01:01:52,822
Very well. In the interest
of saving time, we´ll proceed.

934
01:01:53,061 --> 01:01:56,724
I´m sure Officer Peters
is most anxious to go home...

935
01:01:56,965 --> 01:01:59,627
...to his wife and family
before returning to duty.

936
01:01:59,868 --> 01:02:03,235
Now, Officer Peters, except
for the blood, the clothes were dry.

937
01:02:03,471 --> 01:02:04,870
-Yes, sir.
-They were dry...

938
01:02:05,106 --> 01:02:08,200
...yet the defendant stated
he threw the body into the bay.

939
01:02:08,443 --> 01:02:12,539
Your Honor, the district attorney isn´t
cross-examining, he´s making speeches.

940
01:02:12,781 --> 01:02:13,577
That isn´t so.

941
01:02:13,815 --> 01:02:18,411
I move for a mistrial on the grounds
that the jury is being prejudiced.

942
01:02:18,653 --> 01:02:22,384
These are the great Bannister´s
trial tactics in appeal for sympathy.

943
01:02:22,624 --> 01:02:24,888
The D.A. is beginning
to get vicious.

944
01:02:25,126 --> 01:02:28,994
When you two gentlemen get over your
argument, tell me who won.

945
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:31,425
Then I´ll decide on the objection.

946
01:02:33,401 --> 01:02:34,925
Objection sustained.

947
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:37,195
Your witness, Mr. Bannister.

948
01:02:37,439 --> 01:02:39,100
No questions.

949
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,739
Except...

950
01:02:40,975 --> 01:02:41,771
Yes.

951
01:02:42,744 --> 01:02:44,507
Officer Peters...

952
01:02:45,447 --> 01:02:48,507
...I don´t wish to keep you
from your wife and children...

953
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:53,653
...any more than the D.A. who was
so concerned about them a moment ago.

954
01:02:54,589 --> 01:02:58,081
But I would like to ask you
one question.

955
01:02:59,461 --> 01:03:03,192
Officer Peters, have you
a wife and children?

956
01:03:03,598 --> 01:03:04,826
Well...

957
01:03:06,334 --> 01:03:07,130
...no.

958
01:03:10,071 --> 01:03:12,335
Thank you. You may step down.

959
01:03:12,841 --> 01:03:14,809
Call your next witness.

960
01:03:15,844 --> 01:03:17,471
I call...

961
01:03:20,048 --> 01:03:21,913
...Arthur Bannister.

962
01:03:26,087 --> 01:03:30,456
It´s unusual, Your Honor, to put a
defense attorney on the witness stand...

963
01:03:30,692 --> 01:03:34,890
...but I´m confident that my client
will make no objection.

964
01:03:35,296 --> 01:03:37,787
He can´t make Bannister testify
against his own client, can he?

965
01:03:38,032 --> 01:03:39,056
Hey, what happened?

966
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,768
This keeps getting
screwier all the time.

967
01:03:42,003 --> 01:03:45,632
I wouldn´t take this step if there
were any more effective means...

968
01:03:45,874 --> 01:03:48,069
...of establishing the evidence.

969
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:51,437
With my client´s
expressed permission...

970
01:03:52,113 --> 01:03:54,877
Mr. Bannister will take the stand.

971
01:03:56,584 --> 01:03:57,983
Never seen anything like that.

972
01:03:58,219 --> 01:04:00,278
-I thought he was smart!
-None smarter.

973
01:04:03,591 --> 01:04:04,751
You ain´t kidding.

974
01:04:04,993 --> 01:04:06,290
Do you swear to tell...

975
01:04:06,528 --> 01:04:08,257
...the truth and nothing
but the truth...

976
01:04:08,496 --> 01:04:09,485
-...so help you God?
-I do.

977
01:04:09,731 --> 01:04:10,857
State your name.

978
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:12,589
Arthur Bannister.

979
01:04:17,338 --> 01:04:18,999
Mr. Bannister...

980
01:04:20,174 --> 01:04:21,937
...you are a member of the bar?

981
01:04:22,176 --> 01:04:22,972
I am.

982
01:04:29,651 --> 01:04:32,119
And have been for a number of years.

983
01:04:32,453 --> 01:04:33,943
That is correct.

984
01:04:37,425 --> 01:04:41,361
The defendant, Michael O´Hara, worked
as a member of the crew of your yacht?

985
01:04:41,596 --> 01:04:43,154
Yes.

986
01:04:43,398 --> 01:04:45,491
Did he seem happy in his job?

987
01:04:45,733 --> 01:04:47,166
I beg your pardon?

988
01:04:47,669 --> 01:04:51,036
-You had your back turned...
-Did he seem happy in his job?

989
01:04:52,707 --> 01:04:54,902
-Did you get that answer?
-Reasonably so.

990
01:04:55,143 --> 01:04:58,203
As a matter of fact, wasn´t he
threatening to quit?

991
01:04:58,446 --> 01:04:59,811
Yes.

992
01:05:00,081 --> 01:05:03,312
Did you know, Mr. Bannister,
that right after the murders...

993
01:05:04,752 --> 01:05:08,552
...right after the murders we found
the defendant´s bags packed...

994
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:11,816
...in readiness for
an immediate departure?

995
01:05:12,727 --> 01:05:15,890
In your experience as an attorney,
would this not indicate...

996
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:16,926
...premeditation?

997
01:05:17,165 --> 01:05:18,928
The district attorney´s
making speeches...

998
01:05:19,167 --> 01:05:20,634
Premeditation and flight!

999
01:05:20,868 --> 01:05:22,859
Making speeches
and drawing conclusions.

1000
01:05:23,104 --> 01:05:25,231
-I am not drawing conclusions!
-You are!

1001
01:05:25,473 --> 01:05:28,704
He is asking improper questions
in order to influence the jury.

1002
01:05:28,943 --> 01:05:32,504
I must ask Your Honor to declare
a mistrial.

1003
01:05:32,947 --> 01:05:34,710
Overruled.

1004
01:05:34,949 --> 01:05:36,348
Exception.

1005
01:05:36,684 --> 01:05:38,447
No further questions.

1006
01:05:38,686 --> 01:05:41,052
Would Your Honor kindly explain
to the jury...

1007
01:05:41,289 --> 01:05:45,658
...that since the district attorney´s
put me in the position of a witness...

1008
01:05:45,893 --> 01:05:50,592
...that I am committed, as the defense
attorney, to cross examine myself?

1009
01:05:51,966 --> 01:05:56,630
These are more of the persuasive
Mr. Bannister´s trial tactics.

1010
01:05:57,739 --> 01:05:59,570
The jury is so instructed.

1011
01:06:00,742 --> 01:06:01,606
Question:

1012
01:06:01,843 --> 01:06:06,439
Mr. Bannister, did the defendant say
anything as to why he took the job?

1013
01:06:06,681 --> 01:06:09,616
Answer: Yes, Mr. Bannister.

1014
01:06:10,918 --> 01:06:15,787
Be reminded that Mr. Bannister had to
go to the seamen´s hiring hall...

1015
01:06:16,024 --> 01:06:19,926
...and use his persuasive powers
to convince the defendant...

1016
01:06:20,161 --> 01:06:21,788
...to take the job. Question:

1017
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:26,423
Can you think of anything else
that is relevant to this inquiry?

1018
01:06:26,668 --> 01:06:29,660
Well, I found this boy
to be clean-cut...

1019
01:06:29,904 --> 01:06:32,532
...courageous, resourceful, honest...

1020
01:06:32,774 --> 01:06:34,071
...hardworking. Question:

1021
01:06:34,308 --> 01:06:37,641
Mr. Bannister, please answer
the question yes or no.

1022
01:06:37,879 --> 01:06:42,043
Can you think of anything else
that is relevant to this issue?

1023
01:06:42,283 --> 01:06:44,114
Answer: No.

1024
01:06:46,854 --> 01:06:49,322
Very well.
Thank you, Mr. Bannister.

1025
01:06:49,557 --> 01:06:50,990
You may step down.

1026
01:06:53,027 --> 01:06:54,619
Your Honor...

1027
01:06:54,862 --> 01:06:57,888
...I have a subpoena for a witness
who´s in the courtroom.

1028
01:06:58,132 --> 01:07:00,032
May I have the bailiff serve it?

1029
01:07:00,268 --> 01:07:01,292
Bailiff?

1030
01:07:01,803 --> 01:07:04,033
You will serve the subpoena.

1031
01:07:09,644 --> 01:07:12,772
I call Mrs. Arthur Bannister.

1032
01:07:14,382 --> 01:07:16,907
There´s no law that says
she has to take that, is there?

1033
01:07:17,151 --> 01:07:20,120
-Don´t be silly, she´s gotta take it.
-Who says there is?

1034
01:07:21,155 --> 01:07:23,521
Sit down and mind your own business.

1035
01:07:34,836 --> 01:07:36,133
Raise your right hand.

1036
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:38,497
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth...

1037
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:40,935
...the whole truth, so help you God?

1038
01:07:41,175 --> 01:07:42,870
-I do.
-State your name.

1039
01:07:43,111 --> 01:07:44,840
Mrs. Arthur Bannister.

1040
01:07:46,848 --> 01:07:48,042
Mrs. Bannister...

1041
01:07:49,117 --> 01:07:52,848
...did you ever have guards
to police your house...

1042
01:07:53,087 --> 01:07:55,351
...or the yacht on which
you just cruised?

1043
01:07:55,590 --> 01:07:58,081
-No.
-Why?

1044
01:07:58,993 --> 01:08:01,154
We never felt the need of it.

1045
01:08:01,395 --> 01:08:03,363
You have no children, have you?

1046
01:08:05,066 --> 01:08:05,998
I have no children.

1047
01:08:06,234 --> 01:08:07,201
You have no children.

1048
01:08:07,435 --> 01:08:11,371
So you were never concerned about
kidnappers, is that correct?

1049
01:08:11,806 --> 01:08:13,000
That is correct.

1050
01:08:13,474 --> 01:08:18,002
There was a man employed in your house
and on your husband´s yacht named...

1051
01:08:18,246 --> 01:08:19,338
...Sidney Broome?

1052
01:08:20,782 --> 01:08:21,908
Yes.

1053
01:08:22,150 --> 01:08:24,550
You´ve known Mr. Broome
for several years?

1054
01:08:24,786 --> 01:08:25,684
No.

1055
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,118
Would it surprise you if I were to
tell you that the detective...

1056
01:08:30,558 --> 01:08:32,458
...hired by your husband...

1057
01:08:32,693 --> 01:08:36,026
...in divorce cases was Sidney Broome?

1058
01:08:36,264 --> 01:08:38,698
The man you employed
in your house as a butler...

1059
01:08:38,933 --> 01:08:42,096
...and on your husband´s yacht,
who was murdered?

1060
01:08:42,336 --> 01:08:43,769
-I object!
-Does counsel deny...?

1061
01:08:45,139 --> 01:08:45,969
Overruled.

1062
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,435
Does counsel deny...

1063
01:08:47,675 --> 01:08:51,577
...that Detective Broome
is used by him in divorce cases?

1064
01:08:52,113 --> 01:08:56,311
Mrs. Bannister, can you think of any
reason why your husband...

1065
01:08:56,551 --> 01:09:00,009
...would want to hire a divorce
detective, other than to watch you?

1066
01:09:00,254 --> 01:09:01,152
I object!

1067
01:09:01,389 --> 01:09:02,481
Objection sustained.

1068
01:09:02,723 --> 01:09:05,920
As a matter of fact, didn´t you
and your husband argue about...

1069
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,424
...your showing an infatuation
for O´Hara?

1070
01:09:08,663 --> 01:09:09,459
We did not.

1071
01:09:09,697 --> 01:09:13,793
Isn´t it a fact that the defendant
O´Hara made advances to you...

1072
01:09:14,035 --> 01:09:17,232
...and told you he was
infatuated with you?

1073
01:09:20,474 --> 01:09:22,738
He was very respectful.

1074
01:09:22,977 --> 01:09:24,808
Speak up, Mrs. Bannister.

1075
01:09:27,148 --> 01:09:29,378
He was very respectful.

1076
01:09:30,251 --> 01:09:32,947
And I think he was fond of me.

1077
01:09:33,588 --> 01:09:37,786
Just what is your definition
of "fond", Mrs. Bannister?

1078
01:09:39,594 --> 01:09:43,325
You and Michael O´Hara have kissed
each other, haven´t you?

1079
01:09:43,664 --> 01:09:46,827
To name one occasion, you were seen
in the aquarium...

1080
01:09:47,068 --> 01:09:49,093
...kissing each other!

1081
01:09:49,337 --> 01:09:50,929
Do you deny that?

1082
01:09:58,813 --> 01:10:00,110
No.

1083
01:10:01,682 --> 01:10:03,547
No further questions.

1084
01:10:03,784 --> 01:10:06,344
Your witness, Mr. Bannister.

1085
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:10,951
No questions.

1086
01:10:14,795 --> 01:10:16,456
The State Department
refused comment.

1087
01:10:16,697 --> 01:10:19,791
Here in San Francisco,
the fate of Black Irish O´Hara...

1088
01:10:20,034 --> 01:10:23,401
...notorious agitator, whose trial
for the murder of George Grisby...

1089
01:10:23,638 --> 01:10:26,630
...has held the front pages,
remains undecided.

1090
01:10:26,874 --> 01:10:30,401
The jury, already out seven hours,
has still returned no verdict.

1091
01:10:30,645 --> 01:10:33,773
The whole Black Irish case,
according to...

1092
01:10:58,839 --> 01:11:00,534
How long do they take, usually?

1093
01:11:00,775 --> 01:11:02,834
Can´t ever tell about a jury.

1094
01:11:08,549 --> 01:11:09,743
Excuse me, Your Honor.

1095
01:11:10,918 --> 01:11:11,714
Yes?

1096
01:11:11,953 --> 01:11:13,318
The jury´s coming out now.

1097
01:11:13,554 --> 01:11:15,852
Oh, thank you, Officer McNaulty.

1098
01:11:28,102 --> 01:11:29,330
By the way...

1099
01:11:32,373 --> 01:11:34,000
...what has Elsa been telling you?

1100
01:11:34,241 --> 01:11:37,904
Or did you imagine that I didn´t know
she´s been coming to see you?

1101
01:11:38,846 --> 01:11:41,178
-She asked me to trust you.
-But you don´t.

1102
01:11:41,415 --> 01:11:44,043
-The jury has reached its verdict.
-Why?

1103
01:11:44,986 --> 01:11:47,819
Because I know you wanted me
to be convicted.

1104
01:11:48,356 --> 01:11:50,324
Now that it´s too late
to do anything...

1105
01:11:50,558 --> 01:11:54,722
...I might as well tell you,
this is one case I´ve enjoyed losing.

1106
01:11:55,796 --> 01:11:59,061
I´m coming to see you in the death
house, Michael. Every day.

1107
01:12:00,267 --> 01:12:02,997
Our little visits will be great fun.

1108
01:12:03,237 --> 01:12:05,171
I´m going to ask for a stay
of execution.

1109
01:12:05,406 --> 01:12:07,499
I really hope it´ll be granted.

1110
01:12:08,309 --> 01:12:11,335
I want you to live as long
as possible before you die.

1111
01:12:11,579 --> 01:12:14,275
You´re talking kind of tough,
aren´t you, Mr. Bannister?

1112
01:12:14,515 --> 01:12:18,747
I´ve got an edge. I know you´re
going to the gas chamber.

1113
01:12:19,387 --> 01:12:20,786
Don´t be so sure.

1114
01:12:21,455 --> 01:12:23,423
I know the killer.

1115
01:12:24,658 --> 01:12:26,819
I know who murdered Grisby.

1116
01:12:28,462 --> 01:12:29,986
Michael?

1117
01:12:38,873 --> 01:12:41,467
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
do you have a verdict?

1118
01:12:41,709 --> 01:12:43,267
-We, the jury...
-Wait a minute!

1119
01:12:45,079 --> 01:12:46,706
Poison! Poison pills!

1120
01:12:47,882 --> 01:12:49,440
Bring him to my chambers!

1121
01:12:52,887 --> 01:12:54,354
Get that doctor!

1122
01:12:54,588 --> 01:12:57,489
I talked to the doctor.
Said to keep him on his feet.

1123
01:12:57,725 --> 01:13:00,353
-We need help.
-I can´t hold this crowd by myself.

1124
01:13:00,594 --> 01:13:03,961
The way I understand it, he´ll be
all right if we keep him moving.

1125
01:13:04,198 --> 01:13:06,666
-I need help!
-lf he sleeps, he´s done for.

1126
01:13:06,901 --> 01:13:08,027
Done for? Well!

1127
01:13:08,269 --> 01:13:11,534
I need two officers to control
the crowd in my courtroom!

1128
01:13:11,772 --> 01:13:13,672
I´ll try and get rid of the reporters.

1129
01:13:13,908 --> 01:13:18,777
You´ll do no such thing! I´ll see
them. I´ll see the reporters myself.

1130
01:13:19,046 --> 01:13:20,479
We have to prepare a statement.

1131
01:13:20,714 --> 01:13:22,511
That´s it, keep him walking.

1132
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:24,615
All right, Mr. Galloway.

1133
01:13:43,537 --> 01:13:45,004
No pictures, please!

1134
01:14:24,145 --> 01:14:27,376
Stay close together while I
escort you out to dinner.

1135
01:14:27,615 --> 01:14:28,775
-It's him.
-What can we do?

1136
01:14:29,016 --> 01:14:30,210
We gotta think of something.

1137
01:14:30,718 --> 01:14:33,687
That´s another jury
from another trial across there.

1138
01:14:33,921 --> 01:14:35,513
He´s walking out with them!

1139
01:14:37,124 --> 01:14:40,992
The judge hopes you will arrive at
a verdict as soon as possible.

1140
01:14:45,065 --> 01:14:46,896
That way! Come on.

1141
01:14:47,401 --> 01:14:50,768
My goodness! My window!
My chessboard.

1142
01:14:51,005 --> 01:14:53,030
McNaulty! Officer Fishbein!

1143
01:14:53,274 --> 01:14:55,265
I expect a full report from you.

1144
01:14:55,509 --> 01:14:57,477
Get off the floor, Officer Fishbein.

1145
01:14:57,711 --> 01:14:59,508
-No pictures.
-What happened?

1146
01:14:59,747 --> 01:15:02,978
That woman´s too nice-looking
to have stolen that jewelry.

1147
01:15:03,217 --> 01:15:06,345
Jury duty´s such a responsibility,
don´t you think?

1148
01:15:07,621 --> 01:15:11,921
You were told not to talk about the
case. Don´t let it happen again.

1149
01:15:27,575 --> 01:15:28,371
Elsa!

1150
01:17:52,553 --> 01:17:53,417
Hello, Li?

1151
01:17:53,854 --> 01:17:54,843
Hello.

1152
01:18:23,751 --> 01:18:26,914
-Why did you do it?
-I didn´t. I´m not guilty.

1153
01:18:27,287 --> 01:18:30,848
Oh, the pills, you mean. The pills.

1154
01:18:31,091 --> 01:18:33,924
I saw you begging me to swallow.
Begging me with your eyes.

1155
01:18:34,161 --> 01:18:37,995
You didn´t mean for me to take
them all. I held some back.

1156
01:18:38,232 --> 01:18:41,360
I took too many of the pills.
I´m faint.

1157
01:18:41,602 --> 01:18:43,263
And now what?

1158
01:18:44,405 --> 01:18:46,270
Don´t you know they´ll catch you?

1159
01:18:46,507 --> 01:18:48,407
I´ve got to find that gun.

1160
01:18:48,642 --> 01:18:50,667
Gun? What gun?

1161
01:18:50,911 --> 01:18:53,675
The gun that killed Grisby.
It´ll prove I´m innocent.

1162
01:18:56,116 --> 01:18:58,914
Well, I phoned our servant Li.

1163
01:18:59,153 --> 01:19:01,951
We´re trying to arrange something.
Someplace to take you.

1164
01:19:02,189 --> 01:19:04,749
Just wait here quietly
and watch the play.

1165
01:19:17,337 --> 01:19:18,235
The police.

1166
01:19:23,143 --> 01:19:24,872
Put your arms around me.

1167
01:19:52,372 --> 01:19:53,566
Don´t move.

1168
01:20:01,215 --> 01:20:02,147
Don´t you move.

1169
01:20:03,817 --> 01:20:05,307
I told you not to move.
I mean it.

1170
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,148
I found the gun.

1171
01:20:08,755 --> 01:20:11,019
You killed Grisby. Yes!

1172
01:20:12,459 --> 01:20:14,450
You´re the killer.

1173
01:20:30,544 --> 01:20:31,943
I was right.

1174
01:20:32,179 --> 01:20:35,012
She was the killer.
She killed Grisby.

1175
01:20:35,249 --> 01:20:37,080
Now she was going to kill me.

1176
01:20:37,317 --> 01:20:42,016
Li and his friends smuggled me out and
hid me where I´d be safe from the cops.

1177
01:20:42,256 --> 01:20:43,587
Not safe from her.

1178
01:20:43,824 --> 01:20:46,019
One of the Chinese worked
at an amusement park.

1179
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:50,458
It was closed for the season. An empty
amusement park makes a good hideout...

1180
01:20:50,697 --> 01:20:53,063
...and she wanted me hidden.

1181
01:20:55,736 --> 01:20:59,137
Well, I came to...

1182
01:21:00,207 --> 01:21:02,368
...in the crazy house.

1183
01:21:02,609 --> 01:21:04,736
And for a while there...

1184
01:21:04,978 --> 01:21:07,412
...I thought it was me that was crazy.

1185
01:21:07,648 --> 01:21:11,675
After what I´d been through,
anything crazy at all...

1186
01:21:11,919 --> 01:21:13,045
...seemed natural.

1187
01:21:13,287 --> 01:21:17,883
But now I was sane
on one subject. Her.

1188
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:19,490
I knew about her.

1189
01:21:19,726 --> 01:21:22,456
She planned to kill Bannister.

1190
01:21:22,696 --> 01:21:23,993
She and Grisby.

1191
01:21:24,231 --> 01:21:27,359
Grisby was to do it for a share of
Bannister´s money.

1192
01:21:27,601 --> 01:21:29,068
That´s what Grisby thought.

1193
01:21:29,303 --> 01:21:33,034
Of course she meant to kill Grisby
too, after he´d served his purpose.

1194
01:21:33,273 --> 01:21:37,334
Poor howling idiot, he never even
did that. He went and shot Broome.

1195
01:21:37,578 --> 01:21:39,876
And that was not part of the plan.

1196
01:21:40,113 --> 01:21:43,014
Broome might have got to
the police before he died.

1197
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:47,584
And if the cops traced it to Grisby
and the cops made him talk...

1198
01:21:47,955 --> 01:21:49,354
...he´d spill everything...

1199
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:54,323
...and she´d be finished. So she
had to shut up Grisby, but quick.

1200
01:21:55,228 --> 01:21:57,162
And I was the fall guy.

1201
01:22:33,433 --> 01:22:35,424
In here.
We´re less likely to be heard.

1202
01:22:35,669 --> 01:22:38,137
I thought it was your husband
you wanted to kill.

1203
01:22:38,372 --> 01:22:40,806
Why don´t you try to understand?

1204
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:43,532
George was supposed to
take care of Arthur.

1205
01:22:43,777 --> 01:22:47,008
But he lost his silly head
and shot Broome.

1206
01:22:48,248 --> 01:22:51,115
After that, I knew
I couldn´t trust him.

1207
01:22:51,785 --> 01:22:53,343
He was mad.

1208
01:22:53,887 --> 01:22:54,785
He had to be shot.

1209
01:22:55,489 --> 01:22:56,786
And what about me?

1210
01:22:57,024 --> 01:22:58,651
We could have gone off together.

1211
01:22:58,892 --> 01:23:01,087
Into the sunrise.

1212
01:23:01,795 --> 01:23:04,491
You and me? Or you and Grisby?

1213
01:23:04,731 --> 01:23:05,527
I love you.

1214
01:23:05,766 --> 01:23:10,669
One who follows his nature keeps
his original nature in the end.

1215
01:23:11,772 --> 01:23:15,435
But haven´t you heard ever of
something better to follow?

1216
01:23:19,012 --> 01:23:20,445
No.

1217
01:23:25,752 --> 01:23:27,652
I knew I´d find you two together.

1218
01:23:27,888 --> 01:23:31,881
If I hadn´t, Elsa, I might have gone on
playing it your way.

1219
01:23:32,125 --> 01:23:33,285
You didn´t know that...

1220
01:23:33,527 --> 01:23:35,188
...but you did plan for me
to follow you.

1221
01:23:35,429 --> 01:23:36,418
You´ve been drinking.

1222
01:23:36,663 --> 01:23:39,996
I presume you think that if you
murder me here...

1223
01:23:40,233 --> 01:23:42,258
...your sailor friend will get
the blame.

1224
01:23:42,502 --> 01:23:44,094
You´ll be free to
spend my money.

1225
01:23:45,305 --> 01:23:48,672
Well, dear, you aren´t the only one
who wants me to die.

1226
01:23:48,909 --> 01:23:51,139
Our good friend,
the district attorney...

1227
01:23:51,378 --> 01:23:54,347
...is just itching to open a letter
that I left with him.

1228
01:23:55,048 --> 01:23:57,573
The letter tells all
about you, lover.

1229
01:23:58,685 --> 01:24:01,483
So you´d be foolish to
fire that gun.

1230
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:05,617
With these mirrors it´s
difficult to tell.

1231
01:24:05,892 --> 01:24:08,383
You are aiming at me, aren´t you?

1232
01:24:08,862 --> 01:24:10,591
I´m aiming at you, lover.

1233
01:24:11,565 --> 01:24:14,261
Of course, killing you
is killing myself.

1234
01:24:15,035 --> 01:24:16,832
It´s the same thing.

1235
01:24:18,371 --> 01:24:21,602
But you know, I´m pretty
tired of both of us.

1236
01:24:44,931 --> 01:24:47,991
You know, for a smart girl,
you make a lot of mistakes.

1237
01:24:49,069 --> 01:24:51,264
You should have let me live.

1238
01:24:51,805 --> 01:24:53,397
You´re gonna need a good lawyer.

1239
01:25:01,348 --> 01:25:04,943
He and George...

1240
01:25:08,155 --> 01:25:09,645
...and now me!

1241
01:25:09,890 --> 01:25:14,054
Like the sharks,
mad with their own blood.

1242
01:25:14,294 --> 01:25:17,127
Chewing away at their own selves.

1243
01:25:18,398 --> 01:25:19,888
It´s true.

1244
01:25:23,036 --> 01:25:25,561
I made a lot of mistakes.

1245
01:25:26,106 --> 01:25:29,166
You said the world´s bad
and we can´t run away from that.

1246
01:25:29,409 --> 01:25:30,467
You´re right there.

1247
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:35,443
But you said we can´t fight it. We
must deal with the badness, make terms.

1248
01:25:35,682 --> 01:25:37,912
And then the badness deal with you.

1249
01:25:38,151 --> 01:25:41,120
Make its own terms
in the end, surely.

1250
01:25:41,354 --> 01:25:44,915
You can fight, but what good is it?

1251
01:25:47,494 --> 01:25:48,722
Goodbye.

1252
01:25:48,962 --> 01:25:50,486
You mean we can´t win?

1253
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:53,665
No, we can´t win.

1254
01:25:55,001 --> 01:25:57,333
Give my love to the sunrise.

1255
01:25:57,571 --> 01:26:00,096
We can´t lose either.

1256
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:01,807
Only if we quit.

1257
01:26:02,042 --> 01:26:04,033
And you´re not going to?

1258
01:26:04,277 --> 01:26:05,642
Not again.

1259
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,975
Oh, Michael...

1260
01:26:10,984 --> 01:26:12,508
...I´m afraid.

1261
01:26:15,622 --> 01:26:16,748
Michael?

1262
01:26:18,358 --> 01:26:19,916
Come back here.

1263
01:26:20,627 --> 01:26:21,821
Michael?

1264
01:26:22,729 --> 01:26:24,196
Please!

1265
01:26:25,098 --> 01:26:26,827
I don´t want to die!

1266
01:26:28,335 --> 01:26:30,803
I don´t want to die!

1267
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:42,013
I went to call the cops, but I knew
she´d be dead before they got there.

1268
01:26:42,249 --> 01:26:43,978
And I´d be free.

1269
01:26:44,217 --> 01:26:49,120
Bannister´s note to the D.A. fixed it.
I´d be innocent, officially.

1270
01:26:49,356 --> 01:26:51,722
But that´s a big word, innocent.

1271
01:26:51,958 --> 01:26:54,483
Stupid is more like it.

1272
01:26:54,728 --> 01:26:59,324
Well, everybody is somebody´s fool.

1273
01:26:59,566 --> 01:27:01,966
The only way to stay out of trouble
is to grow old.

1274
01:27:02,202 --> 01:27:04,636
So I guess I´ll concentrate on that.

1275
01:27:04,871 --> 01:27:07,635
Maybe I´ll live so long...

1276
01:27:07,874 --> 01:27:10,342
...that I´ll forget her.

1277
01:27:10,577 --> 01:27:13,546
Maybe I´ll die trying.
