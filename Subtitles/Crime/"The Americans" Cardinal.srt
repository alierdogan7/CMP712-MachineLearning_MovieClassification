I saw him...

723
00:42:30,178 --> 00:42:32,546
walking back to the room...

724
00:42:32,597 --> 00:42:34,548
when I was leaving.

725
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:38,018
I heard him screaming.

726
00:42:41,072 --> 00:42:44,024
What's gonna happen to him now?

Centre will make sure he's...

729
00:42:48,196 --> 00:42:51,064
- taken care of.
- Taken care of how?

730
00:42:54,402 --> 00:42:56,203
Yeah.

Philip, all these years,

733
00:43:04,095 --> 00:43:08,215
I... I never worried

734
00:43:08,266 --> 00:43:11,435
about Paige and Henry
being safe.

735
00:43:14,189 --> 00:43:16,440
What happened
to Emmett and Leanne,

736
00:43:16,524 --> 00:43:19,109
I always knew that was a risk.

737
00:43:22,364 --> 00:43:26,033
But seeing Amelia...

738
00:43:32,123 --> 00:43:34,274
I mean, how are we gonna live
like this?

739
00:43:36,211 --> 00:43:39,330
We'll get used to it.

740
00:43:39,414 --> 00:43:42,333
Like we got used
to everything else.

741
00:43:46,454 --> 00:43:49,306
I can't believe I pulled Henry
into that--

742
00:43:49,391 --> 00:43:54,011
I... I pulled him into <i>this.</i>

743
00:43:54,095 --> 00:43:57,314
You didn't have a choice.

744
00:43:57,399 --> 00:43:59,483
Yeah.

745
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:03,437
I did.
