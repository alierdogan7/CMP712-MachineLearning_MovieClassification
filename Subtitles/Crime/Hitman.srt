- You don't have jurisdiction.

867
01:26:42,482 --> 01:26:44,848
We aren't here.
Which means when we open up on you...

868
01:26:44,951 --> 01:26:48,216
and shred your bodies with automatic fire,
then this will never have happened.

869

I think.

<i>So, Inspector...</i>

887
01:28:03,629 --> 01:28:07,224
how does a good man
decide when to kill?

888
01:28:08,901 --> 01:28:12,132
If I think that a man means
to do me or my family harm...
