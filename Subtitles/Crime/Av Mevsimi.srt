3
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,637
Last night the moon was out.

4
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,634
I couldn't even look up.

5
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,189
The moon reflected on the water.

6
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,870
I hear sounds.

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,359
Perhaps I heart he leaves falling.

8
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,029
Sometimes small animals walk around.
Some of them are on me.

9
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,237
I'm not scared.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,878
It's peaceful here, maybe that's why.

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,237
What if I laid down like this forever?

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,190
Why not?
As long as they don't hurt me.

13
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,513
"He" brought me here.

14
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,389
First all the sounds disappeared.

15
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,637
Then I heard the forest.

16
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,677
Now let's get to the bottom of this.

17
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,638
The first thing we say to newcomers
in the homicide department is;

18
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,439
If you look at things from one
perspective you only see one thing.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,230
Will what you see bring you...

20
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,709
...to resolution or does it
get between you and reality?

21
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,633
Sounds complicated, doesn't it?

22
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,632
Let me rephrase it.
You look and you see this.

23
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,836
You say; 'This is it!"
"This is the murderer. "

24
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,393
What if it isn't?
Could you be wrong?

25
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,914
Of course!

26
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,231
Maybe you can't figure it out
from where you're looking.

27
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,469
Dead end.

28
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,716
What do we do?

29
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,030
- We change our position.
- How?

30
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,310
We exit the dead end enter another street.

31
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,232
Find a road where we can see ahead.

32
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,189
That's right.
We will change our perspective.

33
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,632
We will find an opening and
look through there to see reality.

34
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,629
- Your name is Hasan, right?
- Yes, it is, chief.

35
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,395
Observe the people around you.

36
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,313
Try to guess their criminal potential.

37
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,959
A painter looks at the paint on the walls...

38
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,071
...when they first walk into a house.
That's called perception.

39
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,111
The homicide cops...

40
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,549
...always seek the suspects.

41
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,831
Suspicion, always suspicion!

42
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,830
That's all for today.

43
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,038
Send this as soon as possible,
understood?

44
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,793
Report back to me once it's sent.
- Yes, sir.

45
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,110
A hand was found
in the swamp forest in Selamli.

46
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,998
Go there immediately and
report to me on the phone...

47
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,838
- We're not on duty, sir.
- I know, Ýdris.

48
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,157
But the team that's on
duty is collecting another dead body.

49
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,839
They can't be in two places at once.

50
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,634
- Are you convinced?
- Murat Öneþ speaking.

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,956
You can't keep your mouth shut!
Life talked, take him in right away!

52
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,031
- Sir, Tahir Akça called.
- Which one was that?

53
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,316
We found his son's body in
the backyard, in the chicken coop.

54
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,357
- I remember, what about it?
- Will you join the interrogation?

55
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,078
- Sir, are we going to talk?
- What?

56
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,549
- Are we going to talk?
- Go to my office. I'll be there.

57
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,312
Call me in for the interrogation.

58
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,313
- What about the phone?
- Muharrem Buhar talked. He confessed.

59
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,317
Hopefully he won't change his mind
when his lawyer is around.

60
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,636
- And there's the other case.
- Sir, tea?

61
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,951
Whose case are you on?
- His dad was killed inside a car. His son.

62
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,113
I think he did it. He's crying too much
after him. Too much.

63
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,349
- Done?
- Done.

64
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,236
Why are you still here?

65
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,476
The prosecutor is Macit Hakman.
Don't let him come after me.

66
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,352
I don't like that man. Go now!

67
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,272
We'll go but what shall we do
about the staffing?

68
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,873
What staffing?

69
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,511
We've been short-staffed for two months.
We've been working day and night.

70
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,875
Ýdris is right, sir. We can't keep up.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,275
Choose from one of the newcomers.

72
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,479
We need an experienced...

73
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,030
- Go get that boy.
- Which one?

74
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,270
The one who answered my question.
His name was Hasan, I think.

75
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,988
Why him? Is he suitable?
Is he a good fit? Who is he?

76
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,156
Ýdris, just bring me the boy!

77
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,792
Fine, fine.

78
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,509
- Tell me son.
- What should I tell you, sir?

79
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,672
What did you study? Where do you
come from where do you go?

80
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,956
- Before the service?
- Yes.

81
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,838
I studied anthropology.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,117
- I'm currently writing my thesis.
- What is your thesis about?

83
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,078
About serial killers in Turkey.

84
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,353
That's why I chose the homicide.
And thankfully they chose me, too.

85
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,194
There are serial killers in Turkey
that we don't know about?

86
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,830
No there isn't. That's what my thesis
is trying to answer. Why not?

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,036
My thesis is called;
An Anthropological Evaluation...

88
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,476
...of Serial Murders as a
Unique Product of Western Society.

89
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,513
That's a very flashy name but
you didn't need to go to university...

90
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,639
...to find out why there are no
serial killers in Turkey. We'd tell you.

91
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,272
- Are you married?
- No.

92
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,351
- Girlfriend?
- Yes, sir.

93
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,239
- Is it serious?
- Kind of.

94
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,317
Is she also an athropopopologist?

95
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,432
Is this really important?

96
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,158
- Stay close to me, write everything down.
- Okay.

97
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,830
- Greetings.
- Greetings Serdar. Hello everyone.

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,470
Ýdris, how are you?
- Thanks. Kadir isn't around?

99
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,875
You finally made it.
We've been waiting for you.

100
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,838
You're right but
the traffic was really bad.

101
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,191
Prosecutor Macit, we're not even
supposed to be on duty today. Hi doctor!

102
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,514
Let me introduce. Anew addition to
our team, Hasan Rifat Adigüzel.

103
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,513
Best of luck to you.
Should we call you Hasan or Rýfat?

104
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,990
- Hasan would work, sir.
- Fine. What's the situation?

105
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,078
Suspicious death.
So far we only found a mutilated arm.

106
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,068
- The search is ongoing.
- The team is great.

107
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,791
- No other body parts?
- Nothing.

108
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,312
- Who found it?
- This guy saw it.

109
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,719
The waiter at the teahouse across.
He called us during the day.

110
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,631
He didn't see any suspects. Not many folks
come here during this season.

111
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,957
Let me take a look at this hand.

112
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,029
Let's pray that the other body parts will surface.
It's tough just one hand.

113
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,078
Hasan, say hi to the hand.

114
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,959
What are you doing, this is evidence!

115
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,839
Can I have a look?

116
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,588
What kind of a cut is this doctor?

117
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,398
I think it's a knife cut...

118
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,113
...but I'm just saying that without analyzing.

119
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,430
It looks like it was cut after death.

120
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,798
The blood had left the body.
The bruises confirm it, too.

121
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,192
- Looks like a kid's hand.
- Could also be a young girl.

122
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,239
- There is nail polish.
- Right. It's a young girl's hand.

123
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,796
We need help over here.
Give us a hand, please?

124
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,355
Let's go Hasan, you said hi to the hand...

125
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,875
...and now comes
a brand new experience.

126
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,996
You held on well.

127
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,475
I saw a lot of newbie's faint
on their first day.

128
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,756
I found a bone.

129
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,750
This is probably an animal bone.

130
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,953
What are we looking for here?

131
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,078
Anything that might count as evidence.
The arm has been cut with a knife.

132
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,550
Start with the knife,
then the syringe, underwear, lipstick...

133
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,354
...bag, driver's license, ID.
They didn't teach...

134
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,155
...this stuff to you?
Go ahead.

135
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,074
Where am I?

136
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,395
I'm in a lot of places.

137
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,831
I'm everywhere.

138
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,999
I'm scattered.
I disappeared.

139
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,559
- I'm done watching the game.
- What happened?

140
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,588
The team is not even walking,
let alone running.

141
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,599
Trabzonspor is a different story.
That's in my blood.

142
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,517
Ýdris, tell Crime Scene Investigation...

143
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,836
...that there are boot and wheel prints here.

144
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,679
Tell them to take pictures and molds.

145
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,074
- Don't forget about tomorrow night!
- What's tomorrow night?

146
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,076
Detective Mustafa's retirement night.
At Halit Brother's coffee house.

147
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,155
Follow the forensics.

148
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,880
How about a drink after work?

149
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,079
I don't want to make Kezban wait.
She's waiting on the missus all day.

150
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,996
Just one drink.
Newby you, too.

151
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,748
- How's your wife?
- She's doing ok.

152
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,074
First we're going to set up
the investigation format.

153
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,589
You brought me along
without setting up the format.

154
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,758
The format takes just two minutes.
Let's just enjoy this.

155
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,077
I washed my hands and face
many times and it still smells.

156
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,999
It'll stink for a while. The smell
of a corpse stays.

157
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,757
Let's drink.

158
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,357
Don't worry about it. All in due time.

159
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,551
So your mom is in Ankara.
- And your dad?

160
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,154
He passed away.
My mom lives with my sister.

161
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,675
Is your girlfriend here?
Does she have a job?

162
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,075
Yes. She owns a restaurant,
also a butcher.

163
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,555
A restaurant owner and a butcher.
Interesting.

164
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,154
Her father owns a meat restaurant.
It's in the family.

165
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,838
- Do you happen to be married?
- No need to be so formal with me.

166
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,475
He was married but he's crazy.
Couldn't keep the girl.

167
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,437
You, too?

168
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,835
And it is me who held their wedding.

169
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,598
Yes, why don't you tell him.

170
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,675
He kidnapped thru poor girl.

171
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,678
No, first start with
"They didn't allow the wedding. "

172
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,518
Then you tell the story, we'll listen.

173
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,360
He kidnapped Asiye but
her family went after him.

174
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,630
They decided to shoot Ýdris.

175
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,631
His family is also strong-willed.

176
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,631
They're from the Black Sea Region.
Bunch of crazies.

177
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,358
They were about to have a feud.

178
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,917
At the time I was doing my service
in their hometown.

179
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,350
His father and I became really close.

180
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,790
He was teaching me how to build boats.
We used to go out fishing together.

181
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,678
So anyway.

182
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,429
Cemil, his father said;

183
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,235
I fit was up to me I'd say shoot him,
he'll learn a lesson.

184
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,790
But his mom would be very upset.
He said "Could you do something about it?"

185
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,679
He said
"Go do something not could you?"

186
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,436
I'd do anything for Cemil,
so I talked to both families.

187
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,918
They forgave him. I saved his ass.

188
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,473
May God bless you.

189
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,918
After my father died in the sea,

190
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,519
Ferman became like a father to me.

191
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,588
Thanks to him I'm in the service.

192
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,074
I could never pay him back.

193
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,075
It's hard to make a marriage work
with this job.

194
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,635
Asiye is a little crazy
but she's a nice girl.

195
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,712
I made her suffer a lot.

196
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,836
We were trying to make it work but
it didn't, with all the fighting.

197
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,311
Sorry Kezban, I'm a little late.

198
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,674
Don't even mention it.

199
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,236
How is she today?

200
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,153
You know she can be a little tired
on days like this.

201
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,994
- Could I leave?
- Of course.

202
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,357
God bless you.

203
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,919
- Good night.
- Good night.

204
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,436
Bro, could you look over here?

205
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,269
- You guys had a few drinks?
- That crazy guy, he insisted.

206
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,520
- How was your day?
- As usual.

207
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,996
- We found a hand.
- What? A hand?

208
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,314
Oh my God, I don't believe it.

209
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,799
What did you do with the hand?

210
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,757
It was sent to the forensics
in a package.

211
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,836
- It smells in here.
- Really?

212
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,680
Mr. Arda, excuse me.

213
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,437
It smells in here.

214
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,428
That's not possible.
You're right. There is a smell.

215
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,558
Pelinsu I'm talking to you.

216
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,594
Nanna I'm on the phone.
Just give me a break.

217
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,869
Come and gather your things.

218
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,190
Nanny! I'll call you back later.

219
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,591
You never listen to what I say.

220
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,951
We spend our lives trying to understand
what you're saying.

221
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,236
What kind of language is that Pelinsu?

222
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,916
What kind of language?
I don't speak her language.

223
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,395
You better send me to learn it,
maybe then I'll understand her.

224
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,913
You don't know what you're saying.

225
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,998
You're starting to sound like your mom.

226
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,909
Efecan did you eat?
You're done eating but I haven't eaten.

227
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,270
Go to your rooms, right now.
Pelinsu you, too.

228
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,598
- But dad, there's a show on TV...
- I said, right now.

229
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:25,430
The boy never comes home,
the girl is always on the phone.

230
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,360
- What happened?
- Nothing.

231
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,028
- Ýdris, what happened?
- Nothing mom.

232
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,591
Things happen every day. Robbery,
kidnapping. Is this what you worry?

233
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,635
My hand is not pretty.

234
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,839
My mom's hands are pretty
but they smell like onions.

235
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,075
My dad's hands smell like cigarettes,
they're black.

236
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,235
They become more black when he's angry.

237
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,917
My granddad used to say hands tell tales.

238
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,915
My granddad used to tell tales
with his hands.

239
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,428
People used to stare at his hands.

240
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,520
He used to say each hand has a story.

241
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,078
He could see it, I guess.

242
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,917
When I look at my hands...

243
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,156
I only see bitten nails

244
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,790
OK, I get it, but?

245
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,315
We'll move forward after we hear
what the forensics and CSI say.

246
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,435
The forensics are working on the hand,

247
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,596
CSI is looking for the rest of the body.

248
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,234
We saw the hand.

249
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,118
The fingertips have been really damaged
by the water.

250
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,235
Fingerprints will be hard to get.

251
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,711
All we know is that the arm was cut
with a knife...

252
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,393
...and belongs to a young girl.

253
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,676
And was mutilated after death.

254
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,358
Doctor, give me good news!

255
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,279
I stayed up all night,
but I got the fingerprints.

256
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,356
Doctor, you're great!

257
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,437
Fingerprints need to be transferred
to the CSI.

258
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,596
We'll take care of it.

259
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,758
According to the girl's bone development
she is about 15 or at most 16.

260
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,076
Death took place about
2 to 5 days ago.

261
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,231
There were pieces of skin inside
her finger nails.

262
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,913
I'll check the DNA.

263
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,236
Hopefully,
the skin belongs to the attacker.

264
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,152
I beg you, please hurry up.

265
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,032
Good news.
The doctor got the fingerprints.

266
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,829
And he found some skin fragments.
He'll check the DNA.

267
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,350
Death took place
at the most 5 days ago.

268
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,915
Okay. Good luck with the work.

269
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,437
- Is this the new guy?
- Yes.

270
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,996
- How is he?
- Good in theory not so much in practice.

271
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,793
Hasan go to forensics, right away!

272
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,632
Get the fingerprint flee...

273
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,233
...and take it to CSI.

274
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,119
Then, read the files on the other cases.
Take notes.

275
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,554
I'm going to ask questions.

276
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,075
Read very carefully the case of the son...

277
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,599
...who is suspected in his father's death.

278
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,189
Ýdris, your wife is here.

279
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,279
What are you doing here?

280
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,835
What have you done?

281
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,314
What kind of a man are you?

282
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,359
- What are you taking about?
- You hospitalized the poor man.

283
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,949
- Are you crazy?
- Are you just realizing that?

284
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,792
Life got really hurt
he should report it to the police.

285
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,551
You bandit!

286
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,995
You beat him up and
then you show him your badge.

287
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,349
How can he report you?

288
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,155
I'm going to lose my job because of you.
Don't mess up with my job.

289
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,277
I can't survive on the alimony
you give me.

290
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,310
Then stop wagging your tail.

291
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,156
I don't wag my tail to anybody.
Besides I'm single, I live as I wish.

292
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,470
- Don't drive me crazy.
- You're already crazy.

293
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,029
- I swear I'll kill you.
- I dare you to kill me.

294
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,713
Don't come for the kids this weekend.

295
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,678
I won't give them to you.

296
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,790
What do you mean?

297
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,792
There is a court order!

298
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,031
F**k the court order!

299
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,269
You're not a man!

300
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,073
Tonight, we're sending off
a beloved colleague from our service.

301
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,916
There's a lot to be said
But it's best to keep it short.

302
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,590
Best of luck to you. This service
will never forget you.

303
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,078
Here is a little something to remind you
of us, from all of your friends.

304
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,439
I'm not much of a talker but
I'll say that...

305
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,519
...I'm leaving my heart behind.
Don't forget me.

306
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,234
Long live the Homicide Department!

307
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,234
I wish we could all retire like this.

308
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,712
He was one of the toughest guys in the job.

309
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,348
The man who owns this coffee house,
him, too.

310
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,396
The man next to Hunter is your namesake,
They're among the legends at the Homicide.

311
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,869
Of course Hunter is the greatest.

312
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,237
- Why do they call him Hunter?
- Why do they call me crazy?

313
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,838
Because I get crazy and he hunts.

314
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,359
- Hello?
- How's it going?

315
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,348
Good. What's up?

316
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,959
My dad wants to meet you,

317
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,509
He said it's about time.
When are you free?

318
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,839
My security firm is looking
for new people.

319
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,996
Let's give you a job there.
You can't live on your retirement pension.

320
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,919
Mustafa, I'm fed up.

321
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,237
I spent my whole life chasing after criminals.

322
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,550
You remember
the case of Ragip from Eyüp?

323
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,153
You got him in the end.

324
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,311
I got him in the end but I lost 14 kilos.

325
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,993
- 14 kilos!
- Ok.

326
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,279
- Your girlfriend?
- How did you know?

327
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,592
You slouched, you glanced sideways,
looked a little surprised.

328
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,799
Your face got red.
Your whole body says it.

329
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,238
Mustafa! Cheers everyone!

330
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,273
Cheers everyone! 1, 2, 3

331
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,110
Oh, my head. It's killing me.
Barely made it to the morning.

332
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,794
It happens when you drink that much.

333
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,712
Thanks.

334
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,395
We kept on drinking. I blacked out.

335
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,828
I don't remember how I made it home.

336
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,317
- Where is he?
- Who? - The newbie!

337
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,517
At the crime scene department.
He'll be back soon.

338
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,751
They found the case from
the fingerprints.

339
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,629
- Wow.
- That's it. We got it.

340
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,394
Her name is Pamuk. Pamuk Seyhan.
Arrested for selling drugs...

341
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,795
...let go for lack of evidence.

342
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,070
There is an address,
no identity number.

343
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,999
She's just a kid! Only 16.

344
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,310
She might be just a kid
but she means business.

345
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,437
She looks real innocent to me,
poor girl.

346
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,870
You're the kid!

347
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,793
Show me a woman who is innocent
and I'll slit my wrists!

348
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,918
Let's go and visit this address...

349
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,399
...and see what we can find.

350
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,513
Go to the car.
I'll be there after I inform Chief Murat.

351
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,635
Even a dog wouldn't stand this smell.

352
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,030
- Yes?
- Police.

353
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,038
- What's it?
- Could we come in?

354
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,235
Excuse the mess.

355
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,476
- What's the purpose of your visit?
- What's your name?

356
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,394
Kamuran, sir. Kamuran Tora.

357
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,630
Do you know this person?

358
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,069
- Sure I do. This is Pamuk.
- Does she live here?

359
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,719
- No.
- How do you know her?

360
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,712
She used to come by my workplace!

361
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,429
- What do you do?
- Bartender. Pamuk used to hang out at the bar.

362
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,109
She was underage
but the boss didn't mind.

363
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,595
- We became friends overtime.
- Was she your lover?

364
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,796
- No, I'm gay.
- Do you have her phone number?

365
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,353
Of course! - She gave the police
your address as her residence.

366
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,310
We'll, she has a boyfriend, Acid.

367
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,313
What do you mean?
His nickname is Acid. He sells drugs.

368
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,314
Acid Ömer. He used to sell at the bar.
He's a total jerk.

369
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,879
He would beat her up all the time.

370
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,712
Pamuk would come stay with me for a day
or two...

371
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,598
...then she'd go back to that asshole.

372
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,075
They arrested her for selling drugs...

373
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,556
...she had no idea
what was inside her purse.

374
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,190
That jerk was using her.
They let her go.

375
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,233
She must've given my address
at the station not to give him up.

376
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,915
She's going to get me in trouble!
Here's her number.

377
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,756
You got Acidt's number?

378
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,793
No. He changes it frequently.

379
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,918
He is around a lot but
no one knows where he lives.

380
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,952
- How old is he approximately?
- Definitely older than Pamuk.

381
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,589
Perhaps between 20 and 25.

382
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,757
Ýdris, let's get information
from the narcotics about Acid Ömer.

383
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,270
- No one there.
- Did Pamuk have any other boyfriends?

384
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,918
No, she was madly in love with that jerk.

385
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,509
She's from the ghetto and all but
she's real soft, Pamuk.

386
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,235
She's soft like cotton.

387
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,836
- Will this Acid guy come to your place tonight?
- He will!

388
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,633
Life does, call us at this number.
We'll be around.

389
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,156
Hasan, get the bar's address
and number too.

390
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,517
Is there a problem?
Did something happen to her?

391
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,237
Lift did, who would've done it?
- Of course that asshole Acid.

392
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,277
He was beating her up a lot.

393
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,109
He was really mad
when Pamuk refused to sell drugs.

394
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,995
He put his cigarette out on her chest,
right in front of my eyes.

395
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,151
Can you open up your wrists?

396
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,073
- Sorry?
- Can you show me your wrists?

397
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,348
Did you get information on Acid?

398
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,993
Yes it's there.

399
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,238
What if he doesn't call?

400
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,279
Then we're gonna stay up all night.

401
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,436
What if he doesn't call tomorrow night?

402
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,116
Then we're here on duty
every night until he calls us.

403
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,118
Our job is patience, young man.

404
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,718
You know I'm really curious about
this anthropology thing.

405
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,869
What are you curious about?

406
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,676
First of all, why would someone study
something with such a complicated name?

407
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,273
Second, what is anthropology really?

408
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,918
First of all it's because...

409
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,078
...I was placed into it but...

410
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,111
...I started liking it then
I couldn't find a job after I graduated.

411
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,029
That's why I'm a cop.
What is anthropology?

412
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,238
We can call it the
study of humans, roughly.

413
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,789
And more finely?

414
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,875
We'll let me put it this way;

415
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,669
Anthropology studies why
Americans show the middle finger and...

416
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:42,712
...Turks place their thumbs
between two fingers.

417
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,479
That's what anthropology studies.
You got your answer.

418
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,915
Chief if you allow me...

419
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,794
Alright.

420
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,873
- Yes, Yasemin?
- My dad is inviting you to dinner.

421
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,429
Really, what did he say exactly?
In your restaurant?

422
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,715
OK, then.

423
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,316
You better watch out. The people
in the service don't like your behavior.

424
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,796
What was that all about with you
and Asiye, the other day?

425
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,560
- I'm suspicious.
- What are you suspicious about?

426
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,718
That's not a good feeling to have.

427
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,198
You taught us suspicion.

428
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,070
You said; "Be suspicious.
Don't believe what you see.

429
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,390
If you can't see,
change your perspective. "

430
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,750
I changed my perspective towards Asiye.

431
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,275
Tell that to the people in the service.

432
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,112
Yes?

433
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,877
Ok, we're on our way.

434
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,718
I'll call you later.

435
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,512
Hasan, you stay here. Watch the door.

436
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,720
If you see anyone running away,
you follow.

437
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:54,872
Acid! Stop!
Police! Stop!

438
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,672
I got you. We're not done with this
anthropology thing.

439
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,593
Ýdris watch where you're going.
Take down the license number.

440
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,991
I did.
34 VS 4621, did you write it?

441
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,911
I am.

442
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,310
First anthropology, then serial killers.

443
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,075
- Please, don't!
- I gave my doctorate in that field.

444
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,038
- Ýdris, you want me to drive?
- Of course, not.

445
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,954
He turned right.
- He turned right, right.

446
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,559
- Stop.
- Get out of the way.

447
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,035
Move it.

448
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,358
Don't you see the police alarm?
Police!

449
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,636
- Didn't see it.
- Don't you see?

450
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,756
Don't you see it?

451
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,154
- Where the hell did he go?
- This is where you end up if you bullshit...

452
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,039
...and distract yourself.
- You saw it, the car cut in front of me.

453
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,599
- I'm talking to you.
- Hi, chief.

454
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,148
Come back.

455
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,476
Stop. Isn't that
the car in the distance?

456
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,152
- Chief, how did you see it?
- He is the Hunter, he sees.

457
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,119
Don't go in. Let him think
we lost him.

458
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,629
Park here.

459
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,355
Let's silence the radios and the phones.

460
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,274
There are bulletproof vests in the back.

461
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,114
This neighborhood is shady.

462
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,876
He is here.
Let's call for support.

463
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,233
He will fly away until support shows up.

464
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,836
- I say we go in.
- We have no idea what's inside.

465
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,355
It's too risky without the support.

466
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,079
45-28. Station 45-18.

467
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,515
- The bastard's about to leave.
- He says we should wait.

468
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,513
But the guy is as sly as a fox.
He smelled danger.

469
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,318
Support is on its way.

470
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,317
Sir, let me have a quick look around.

471
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,835
- Just wait, they're coming.
I don't feel good about this.

472
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,992
We catch him tonight or
we don't catch him at all.

473
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,913
- He is going to drive me crazy.
- Don't move.

474
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,629
Come on, let's take a walk!

475
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:47,277
Don't let anyone in or out.
And don't take any risks.

476
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,310
- Hey brother.
- Police!

477
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,032
Stop.

478
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,800
We'll done! Your really f**d up!
What are we going to do now?

479
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,197
- Ok. Let's wait for support.
- Listen to me!

480
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,197
We're not narcotics police.
We're from the Homicide Desk.

481
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,516
We don't have a problem with you.

482
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,672
We just want to talk to Ömer.
That's all.

483
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,433
Give us Ömer and we'll go.

484
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,034
Goddamn you!

485
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,874
Why are you not listening?

486
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,718
I said we'll leave after we get Acid.

487
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,479
Stay where you are.

488
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,118
I thought I put you on silent.

489
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,036
Yes Yasemin?

490
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,793
We were going to meet my dad on Sunday.

491
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,514
- Yes!
- Let's make that Monday.

492
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,795
What's all that noise?

493
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,030
- Fireworks.
- What fireworks?

494
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,239
Where are you?
- Can I call you back? I'm really busy.

495
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,433
Stop. I said stop. Police.

496
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,275
Turn around. Slowly! Slowly!

497
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,559
Chief what are you doing?

498
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,398
I raised my hands.

499
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,114
I beg you.

500
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,957
- Are you OK?
- I'm shot.

501
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,196
- What?
- I'm shot.

502
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,072
You're ok.

503
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,038
The bullet is stuck on the vest.

504
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,752
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney.

505
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,309
If you don't have a private one...

506
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,634
...the state will provide you with one.

507
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,716
You ask for support
but you don't wait for it.

508
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,437
Is your duty to be in a crossfire?
Your duty is to catch murderers.

509
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,515
One dead, one injured.
Two detectives under your care.

510
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,875
You risked their lives. An experienced
officer shouldn't do that Hunter.

511
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,437
You're absolutely right, sir.
I made an error in judgment.

512
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,240
I can resign right away.

513
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,189
My retirement is coming up anyway.
Do as you see fit.

514
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,718
Now excuse me.

515
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,075
Take a look, it's Acid's file.

516
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,516
I got you in trouble, didn't I? I'll go talk to
the chief and tell him what really happened.

517
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,076
You got used to acting out on your own Ýdris.

518
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,312
I am still the leader of this team.

519
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,437
When I retire you can do whatever
the hell you want.

520
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,038
But while I'm here you're going
to speak when I allow you to.

521
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:10,759
You understand? Get yourself together,
come to the interrogation room.

522
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,438
Are you ok?

523
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,236
What about you?

524
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:39,350
- A person died.
- A newbie's life was saved.

525
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,877
He was out of bullets.

526
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,474
Look, this is a dirty job,
there is garbage, dead bodies...

527
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,552
bodies torn into pieces,
bad smells.

528
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,039
We deal with dead people.

529
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,594
If you can't handle it,
don't do it.

530
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,831
Go get some sleep now.

531
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,116
Are you hungry Ömer?
You want me to get you a sandwich?

532
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,949
- No, thanks.
- You know her?

533
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,119
- Yes!
- Her name?

534
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,599
- Pamuk.
- Pamuk what?

535
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,998
- Pamuk Seyhan.
- How do you know her?

536
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,230
We were together once.
Once upon a time.

537
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,879
Why were you surprised
to see her?

538
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,877
Perhaps because he didn't think
he would be seeing her again.

539
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,799
- When and how did you meet her?
A few years ago.

540
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,956
At one of those ghetto discoes.

541
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,720
She used to hang out there. And I...

542
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,831
And you needed someone
to sell drugs for you.

543
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,913
First you got her addicted.

544
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,470
She was allergic to all kinds of drugs.
She didn't do drugs.

545
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,632
Besides we were really close.

546
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,710
We really loved each other.

547
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,115
If you really loved her
why did you beat her up?

548
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,675
- Not true, who's making this stuff up?
- You know her family?

549
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,518
- Yes.
- You know her house then.

550
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,709
Yes, I'll give you the address.

551
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,751
You can give the address
after you tell us what happened.

552
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,438
- What happened?
- You look like you could tell us the truth.

553
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,598
We've been up all night.

554
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,639
Just tell us so we can go home.

555
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,916
Please, chief. I didn't do anything.

556
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,469
If you didn't do anything,
why did you run away, you bastard?

557
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,598
Chief I thought you were narcotics.
I had trouble with them.

558
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,189
We know everything.
You even used a knife.

559
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,356
Knife? Do you mean she is killed?

560
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,791
Don't play with us.
As if you don't know.

561
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,833
What knife?
I can't even slice bread.

562
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,991
I swear to God
I have nothing to do with this.

563
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,595
I didn't kill her.
She was my lover.

564
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,392
I loved her and she loved me.

565
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,675
What did she find in you to love?

566
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,277
My eyes are blue.
That's what she used to say.

567
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,117
She loved you and you beat her up.

568
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,394
I beat her up but that was it.
I didn't hurt

569
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,757
You motherf***er. You put your cigarette
out on her chest, you psycho!

570
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,709
Just talk.

571
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,311
I was on a pill. I was high.
I don't even remember.

572
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,152
I haven't seen her for a while.

573
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:24,030
Show me the most important person in the
world and I'll swear on them I didn't do it.

574
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,117
But you know who did it!

575
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,872
There is someone you suspect.

576
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,510
Alright, if you're not gonna say anything...

577
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,508
...I'm gonna have your
whole life get scrutinized.

578
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,234
I'm gonna talk to the prosecutor...

579
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,277
...to keep you locked up forever.

580
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,031
And declare you
as a narcotics informant.

581
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:06,190
For now you have 3 days inside
to think about it.

582
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,675
We'll see if you go something to tell.

583
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,755
Ýdris get the girl's address from him.

584
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,674
Get all his phone calls looked at.

585
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,597
And show me your wrists.

586
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,038
Flip. Open up.

587
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,071
Don't you know that all of our men...

588
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,357
...are the same, with attitude.

589
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,116
That's not true.
Ýdris change a lot.

590
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:07,189
His job ruined him. Each murder
made him crazier than before.

591
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,391
Whatever I did, wherever I looked,
he was suspicious.

592
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,949
He started following me.

593
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,072
He was looking for a hidden meaning
in my every word.

594
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,869
Is it a thing to do?
Who can endure such a torment?

595
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,399
How can you live with a paranoid husband?

596
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,677
Paranoid?

597
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,878
Look, two days ago we found
a young girl's hand.

598
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,550
Perhaps she was running away
from someone as well.

599
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,156
Maybe if her parents were a little
more paranoid it'd be different.

600
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,072
Pray that the same
thing won't happen to you.

601
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,639
I don't want to go dumpster diving
for you corpse.

602
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,438
And I told you. You can't have the kids.
I'm not giving them.

603
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:43,236
- How come you don't give them?
- I just don't. Good bye!

604
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,150
See mom?

605
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,753
He's really crazy!

606
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,194
- See what he's doing?
- Listen to me!

607
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,871
You punish the children not your wife.

608
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,790
They want see their mom.
Stop acting like this.

609
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,193
Yes, sir?

610
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,228
I'm at home.

611
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,950
- Yes?
- Come right away!

612
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,120
- You never sleep?
- We never sleep.

613
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,029
Can you tell me why you're here officer?

614
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,309
Müslüm Bey, we ask the questions here
and you respond.

615
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,432
I'm listening.

616
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,833
Anyone else in this family
besides Pamuk?

617
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,514
She has two brothers.
Abbas and Vakkas.

618
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,517
- Where are they?
- They're at work.

619
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,116
Do you know where your daughter is...

620
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,030
...Hatun Hanim?
- No, officer.

621
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,199
Did you report her as missing?

622
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,595
Why? She's not missing.

623
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,349
- Then you know where she went.
- We do.

624
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,912
God bestowed her with a great
place to go...

625
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,469
...but she didn't appreciate it.
- Don't talk like that.

626
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,711
Why? Is that a lie?

627
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,110
- She didn't live here?
No.

628
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,231
She got married.
She lived with her husband.

629
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,356
How did a 16 year old get married?

630
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:43,439
Battal Bey got her age changed to a
year older and then married her.

631
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:48,835
Opened his house to her,
did everything she wanted...

632
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,393
...but there was something
evil about her...

633
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,358
...she gave all that up
to go be with that good-for-nothing man.

634
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,517
This man, does he nave a name?

635
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,429
Ömer. He's a loser, good-for-nothing.

636
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,632
There was something
between them before.

637
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:09,235
We did everything to keep them apart.
I broke her bones.

638
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,076
Her brothers beat her up but
she kept seeing him in secret.

639
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:20,068
Then we were blessed with Battal Bey.
But now we're disgraced.

640
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,314
Especially against Battal Bey.

641
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,916
- Mr. Battal?
- He's our benefactor.

642
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,831
I've been his gardener since Adana.
My wife used to clean up his mansion.

643
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:39,639
- Pamuk used to help.
- He must be very rich.

644
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,917
- You don't know him?
- Should we?

645
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:49,148
Everyone knows Battal Çolakzade.

646
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,156
This Battal Çolakzade
is that the Battal Çolakzade?

647
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,669
Yes. Owner of Çolakzade Holding.

648
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:02,112
Yes. He owns hundreds of frms. He was
the chairman of the chamber of commerce.

649
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,591
He's very rich.
He's our benefactor.

650
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,995
My dad was his dad's gardener.

651
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,510
He brought us to Istanbul
before Pamuk was born.

652
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,509
My youngest son is helping
his new gardener.

653
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,110
Big family. Sons and daughters.

654
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:22,398
- Wait a second, wasn't he married?
- He was...

655
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,839
...but then he fell for our daughter.
That's how God wanted it.

656
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:32,989
Police officer, tell me.
What happened to my daughter?

657
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:40,674
Hatun Hanim we believe that your
daughter is dead.

658
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,314
We think she has been murdered.

659
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,430
God give the and taketh away.

660
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,158
She got what she deserved.

661
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,549
She lived a life deserving death.

662
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,236
It's our duty to find out who did it.

663
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,429
We'll share the details at the station.

664
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:09,748
The detectives will talk to the neighbors.

665
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,237
- Did she have a room?
- Of course!

666
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:22,033
After she got married I never
touched my sweet one's belongings.

667
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,312
Can I look around?

668
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,033
Show me your wrists.

669
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,354
There are still mosquitoes
buzzing around.

670
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,510
Nothing's changed.

671
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,878
You can't fall
asleep because of the sound.

672
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,069
I smell the gutter.

673
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,310
I smell the onion on my mom.

674
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,113
I don't like that smell.

675
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,469
My mom is a part of the kitchen,

676
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:26,916
always at the
stove, with a wooden spoon.

677
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,635
In my room I imagine things.
I write stories.

678
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,869
I become a ghost. I disappear.

679
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:12,633
Then my dad's hatred,
my brother's violence...

680
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,713
...the grocer's sweaty smell,
screaming kids...

681
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,038
...gossiping neighbor women,
they all disappear.

682
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:27,477
I escape into tales.
I become a ghost. I disappear.

683
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,471
Poor girl, they forced her to
get married at age 16.

684
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,513
Yes but why did Battal
have to change her age?

685
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:46,555
A girl at 16 can marry
with her family's consent.

686
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,471
Guess it wasn't enough or
else why would he bother?

687
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,668
There is a very important player
in the game now; Battal Çolakzade.

688
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,391
He's connected to ministers, parliament
representatives, high-level bureaucrats.

689
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:10,829
Secret phone calls will be made
they'll try to scare us.

690
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:20,755
Go after Battal Çolakzade, take him
in for an interrogation. Be careful.

691
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,274
You can leave now.

692
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,759
Ferman don't let Ýdris...

693
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,674
...get out of control.

694
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:27,437
My two sons manage 5 meat restaurants.
I manage 3.

695
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:31,758
We're a chain. I don't count my daughter,
she does her own thing.

696
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:39,111
But our business is meat not
the restaurant. This meat.

697
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:43,148
My sheep feeds on the grass from
Bursa and Balikesir...

698
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,313
...and my cattle feeds on the grass
from Çankiri.

699
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,832
Why is that? Those grasses have thyme.
Thyme makes meat delicious.

700
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:55,589
My animals never move.
Why?

701
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,314
Cause animals that don't move get fat.

702
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,074
Animals that move,
they get muscles.

703
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,388
My animals stay put.

704
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,672
Dad, are you done talking about meat?

705
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,194
We're you expecting someone else?

706
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,274
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

707
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,870
Your hair, your make-up, your clothes.
You look dolled up.

708
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,276
Ýdris why are you here?
What do you want?

709
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,594
First go get something to wear.

710
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:55,793
Yes, I'm listening.

711
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,153
Ýdris, what is it?

712
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,633
Why do you look like that?

713
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,594
Ýdris what's wrong with you?

714
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,309
Oh my god.
The power went off.

715
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,990
Ýdris get up and get the flash light
from that drawer.

716
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,112
- Ýdris get up.
- Calm down.

717
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,273
- Where is it?
- Inside that drawer.

718
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,397
If you know where it is,
why don't you get it yourself?

719
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:39,030
As if you don't know
I get so scared of the dark.

720
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,391
But you have some
wind in your sails. Coward hero.

721
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,716
- Which drawer?
- That one.

722
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:49,199
You were afraid of the dark when you were
a little kid, you're a big woman now.

723
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,916
- The battery is dead.
- You see? I'm scared.

724
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,034
- Ýdris?
- Yes?

725
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:07,432
There are candles in that cupboard.
Ýdris, go grab them.

726
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,233
Ýdris, that's enough.
Come closer.

727
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:46,479
What did you call me?
Coward hero?

728
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,470
Is there anything else
you know...

729
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,154
...that I am scared of?

730
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,234
- Thunder.
- That was when I was a kid.

731
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,037
What about from me?

732
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:07,032
I was never afraid of you.

733
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:11,558
Crazy people are not scared of each other.

734
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,957
See how my heart's beating.

735
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,711
Maybe I'm a coward.

736
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:06,991
I came here to kill you.

737
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,192
Why?

738
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:16,158
Then kill me.

739
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,355
When I'm gone

740
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:14,479
I know you. You don't take care of
yourself.

741
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:19,312
You're forgetful. You're careless.
You ignore things

742
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,471
That's why I made a list of things
for you to do when I'm gone.

743
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:30,030
I'm writing it down as I remember.

744
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,437
Marriage certificate,
identification cards...

745
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,558
...insurance policy are at the top drawer.

746
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,479
Stomach medicine is in the kitchen.

747
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,558
Don't miss the expiration date,

748
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:47,117
Your underwear is at the top drawer
on your side of the bed.

749
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,517
Abbas, Vakkas, don't get lost!

750
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,070
We'll look into everything you said.
If you lied then you're gonna pay for it.

751
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,959
Show me your wrists.

752
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,799
Ok, go.

753
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,435
Are the brothers involved?

754
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,796
Abbas used to only beat Pamuk.

755
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,798
Maybe he beat her to death.

756
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,673
He says Acid Ömer did it.
He's sure of it.

757
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,672
I even pressed his button.

758
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:20,037
"How can you let that man roam around,
your sister ran away with him?"

759
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,800
He said; "If we'd found him
we wouldn't let him live".

760
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,719
Vakkas said about the same thing.
He says Acid and nothing else.

761
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,715
It's obvious they've
worked on the testimony.

762
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:36,473
Vakkas works as a gardener for
Battal Çolakzade.

763
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:40,038
- That's interesting but why are you grinning?
- It's nothing!

764
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:43,240
They're really big.

765
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:50,078
Roads, construction, textile,
dam building, automotive...

766
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:53,676
We know all that. More importantly,
can we reach anything...

767
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:58,038
...personal about Battal?

768
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:05,359
I have 80 firms that make
4 billion liras a year.

769
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:10,196
I have hundreds of thousands of workers.
Construction, energy, textile.

770
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:13,716
We have over 20% of the market share
in all of them.

771
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,115
But I chose retirement.

772
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,630
I passed the business
over to my children.

773
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,118
It's my time for silence.

774
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,710
I will tell you one last story.
Maybe you get it, maybe you don't.

775
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:32,274
They say I'm a rude man.
Be it.

776
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:36,869
But don't forget in business...

777
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:40,510
...no one pays for politeness.
Intelligence is money.

778
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:45,949
They know I like hunting.
It's a habit I take after my father.

779
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:51,070
He used to take me to the Taurus Mountains
when I was a kid. We're from Adana.

780
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:54,915
We used to hunt whatever we could.

781
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,799
I mean, my dad
was hunting and I watching.

782
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,115
My dad shot a deer once and...

783
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:05,796
I watched
the deer die right in front of me.

784
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,753
His eyes were staring into mine.
I started crying.

785
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,356
That was the first and last time
my dad slapped me.

786
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,989
He said; 'Son,
if you're gonna cry don't come hunting.

787
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:17,152
Death is a part of the hunt. '

788
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:20,357
He said;
"Life is a hunt.

789
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:25,276
Either they hunt you or you hunt.
Make a choice. "

790
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,959
That slap was a lesson.
I never cried after that.

791
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,710
Not even in game hunt or human hunt.

792
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,390
That's the essence of the system.

793
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:41,114
There are hunts and hunters.
You have to decide;

794
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,468
Are you going to be the prey
or the hunter?

795
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,110
- Thank you.
- You chose a great subject.

796
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:57,949
I'm glad you like it. Thank you.

797
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,068
- Glad you could make it.
- You speech was really good.

798
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,630
I'm retired now. You can call me
whenever you want. I'll come running.

799
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,474
Thank you Battal Bey.

800
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,397
Sir, we are from the police service.

801
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:19,229
We need to speak to you
in connection to an investigation.

802
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,471
- Right here and right now?
- Wherever and whenever you want, sir.

803
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:29,719
Let's go to my house then.
We'll have some tea.

804
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,716
Follow us.

805
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,672
- You wait here.
- Why, sir?

806
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,797
Wait.

807
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,037
Wait a minute.

808
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,197
Come in.
