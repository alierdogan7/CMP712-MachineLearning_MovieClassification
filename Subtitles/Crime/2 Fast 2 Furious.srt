00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,793
Let's take a walk.

175
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,094
Carter verone.
Born in argentina.

176
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,598
But he's lived
most of his life in miami.

177
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,398
Now he owns
the biggest import/ export
business in the state.

178
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,736
Unfortunately, the cartels
have been successful
getting drugs into miami.

179
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,866
But they've had
a hard time gettin'
the cash out.

180
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,037
We've been
surveilling him for a year,
but we've never been able...

181
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,047
to put him
and the money together.

182
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,447
- We've swept his house,
his warehouses...
- nothing.

183
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:02,283
Customs here has done
a great job of getting us
this far.

184
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,618
I'm just here to help get
them over the top.

185
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,624
I was able to get
an agent in undercover...

186
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,922
working travel
and logistics for him.

187
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:12,088
Recently, verone put her
in charge of finding
some new drivers.

188
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:16,294
Right. Although we can't
confirm her status right now.
You think she's flipped?

189
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,667
She's one of mine.
She's all right.

190
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:23,333
She's been in with verone
nearly a year. Even lives
at the compound with him now.

191
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,572
Look, it was the f.b.i.'s idea
to bring you in here.

192
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,011
I'm against it. But we need
some good drivers...

193
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,311
that can put this asshole
and his money together.

194
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,317
You're gonna roll
with agent dunn here.

195
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,819
And if i don't?

196
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,654
Well, here's a list
of the laws you broke in l.a.

197
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,592
Obstruction of justice,
aiding and abetting.
You know the rap sheet.

198
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:47,325
Now, we can make this
all go away in the interest
of justice,

199
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,129
if you're willing
to play ball.
Yeah.

200
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:56,597
So what's the idea here?
Dunn and i are supposed
to be street racers?

201
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,973
That's right.

202
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:02,036
[Slurps]

203
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,116
So, dunn...

204
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,254
looks like we're gonna
be partners, bro.

205
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,621
Could you tell me right quick
what would be a better motor
for my skyline,

206
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,592
a gallo 12 or a gallo 24?

207
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,891
Um...
[clears throat]
The 24.

208
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,299
I didn't know
pizza places made motors.

209
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,640
See, man, come on.
I can't do this.

210
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,802
Seriously,
if this is what
you're gonna give me,

211
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,039
i may as well
take my chances in chino.

212
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,709
We will
get someone else.

213
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,979
No way, man.

214
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:46,415
The only way i'll do this is
if i get to pick the driver.

215
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:50,292
[Sighs]
All right, o'conner,
who you got in mind?

216
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,762
This dude i grew up with
in barstow.

217
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,267
Who's that?
Roman pearce.

218
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,168
[Man on p.a., indistinct]

220
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,254
Hi-oh! What...

221
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,925

in the monte carlo?
- [Brian] yeah, that's him.

222
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,125
Yeah, he's got some skills.
Mm-hmm.

223
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,168
And he's crazy as hell,
i'm telling ya.

224
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,863
In a good way though.
He's the man for the job.

225
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:42,213
He's got quite a record,
including three years upstate.

226
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:46,479
Says here he's on
house arrest now. Can't go more
than 100 yards from his home.

227
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:11,002

228
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,169

231
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,924
He always said
he'd be famous.

232
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,024

233
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,932
Roman pearce!

234
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:40,494
- Yo, whatever happens next,
just let it go.
- I ain't in it.

235
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,365
[Whistles]

00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,011
Only my homeboys
call me rome, pig!

237
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:02,751
- I'm not a cop anymore, bro.
- Is that true?

238
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:08,465
- Blondie here's
not a cop anymore?
- That's true. No badge.

239

What the hell
are you doin' here, o'conner?
I'll choke you.

243
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,527
I told you
to stay away from...

244
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,939
you should've told me.
I did three years, brian.

245
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,240
I told you
it wasn't my fault.

246

247
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,781
Why did you
come here, o'conner?

248
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,755
I got a deal for you.

249
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,398
When i needed your ass,
you were nowhere to be found.

250
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:22,133
Now you tryin'
to hand out deals?

251
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,370
I need you
to come to miami
and drive with me.

252
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,813
If you do, they'll take off
that anklet and they'll
clear your entire record.

253
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,942
I did three years in jail.

254
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,078
Three years in jail
off you, brian.

255
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,486

than you think.

So you gonna clean
my record and get this
thing off my ankle?

262

That's right. I thought you
couldn't wander more than
100 yards from your home.

if i should be
trusting you, man.

It's an opportunity
for a fresh start.

270

Let's just go do this.
I wouldn't need
a fresh start...

and go do this.
I don't need to chill out.

273

Yes, you do. And you
need to stop blaming me
for your every mistake.

274

to start taking responsibility
for his own actions.

00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:10,521
Thank you.
Thank you. All right.
How you feeling? A'ight?

500
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:12,619
A'ight.
Thank you.
Thank you, man.

501
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:17,189
Not too bad.
Whoo!

502
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:21,227
I'll see you
about your money, homey.
You race too?

503
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:23,398
[Exhales]
No, man.

504
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,841
I hit a wall doin',
like, a buck 20
couple years ago, you know?

505
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:29,539
Ever since then,
i just been organizing
and collecting, man.

506
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:32,343
Tej, check it out.
He's gonna be in town
for a while.

507
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,078
Is there anyway
he could use that cot?

508
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,086
What's wrong
with your place, man?

509
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:41,250
No, i don't
wanna stay with him.
He got bad habits.

510
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:43,850
[Scoffs]
A'ight, man.
Whatever, man.

511
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,624
Show him around
real quick, a'ight?
I'll be up there in a minute.

512
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,257
Thanks.

513
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,324
A'ight, who want a chance
to win their money back?

514
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:56,294
What's up, jimmy?
So you ever seen
anything like this before?

515
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:59,467
No. Both of them
are wired up
like i never seen before.

516
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:02,603
What?
Yeah, man. They got us
wired with g.p.s.

517
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,639
That's why markham
knew we were gonna be
at that impound lot.

518
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:10,949
Yo, you the master mechanic.
Why don't you just yank
that shit up out of there?

519
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,353
I'll try, but
this ain't lojack.

520
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,882
The d.i.s. Box,
the engine management system,
hell, the main harness...

521
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:18,895
the g.p.s. Is spidered
into all of that.

522
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:22,899
Hey, tell me somethin', man.
Do i even want to know
where the skyline is, dawg?

523
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:24,958
Or where you been
the past couple of days?

524
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:28,493
Or where the hell
you got these rides from?
They're hot.

525
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:32,030
Yeah, they hot. They wired
so hot that whoever's trackin'
these things will know...

526
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,043
every time you don't
wear your seat belt.

527
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,743
All right, jimmy,
just do what
you can do, bro.

528
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:42,149
- I got ya.
- Thanks, man.

529
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,585
Man, we need to get
these on the street asap.

530
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:48,190
Hey, bro,
check it out.

531
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:50,658
You see that cadillac
across the street
over there?

532
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:58,760
Yeah.
Yeah, well, they've been on us
since we left verone's house.

533
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:08,070
[Spanish]

534
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:12,514
Elian and fidel!
[Spanish]

535
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,551
Hey, man, i'll clean
your windshield for you.

536
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:16,779
- What are you doin', man?
- [Laughs]

537
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:19,254
Uno, tres, cuatro,
"fourtro," taco.

538
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,884
[Laughs]
Everything's copecetic, homey.
[Spanish]

539
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,793
Kiss my ass, putos.

540
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:27,763
Shit!

541
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:31,027
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

542
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,529
[Spanish]

543
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,242
He's gonna blow our cover
before we even get started.

544
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,677
Hey, bilkins, can you
tell me what went wrong?
That's what i wanna know.

545
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,806
Show me your hands!
Come on. Keep 'em up!

546
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:47,748
- What's this about, man?
- Hey, w-what's goin' on?

547
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:51,652
Hold this.
You think you can shoot at me?
I'm a goddamn federal agent!

548
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:55,783
What are you talkin' about?
Get your damn hands off me!
Get him away from me!

549
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:59,226
Just 'cause you wear a badge
don't mean you can come in
and mess shit up.!

550
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:02,060
- Get your hands off of me!
- You're lucky
i didn't shoot you.

551
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,760
- Shut up, rome!
- Don't tell me
to shut up, brian!

552
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,632
You almost blew our cover,
old man.

553
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,104
You shouldn't have
shown up like you did.

554
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:11,300
What, you didn't know
verone was testing us?

555
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,673
- No. I thought you punks
were running.
- Running!

556
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:15,735
That's great.
That's real great!

557
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:20,147
Oh, and if rome wanted
to shoot you, you wouldn't
be here right now.

558
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,151
All right.
We gotta get this
under control.

559
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,490
Hey, that's mine.!

560
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,427
- So?
- So tell me what you know.

561
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:35,090
Well, rome and i will be
making a run for verone.

562
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:38,760
I'm not sure when and where.
But he did say
he bought us a window.

563
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,394
I'm assuming
from the local cops.

564
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:43,406
I can talk to
some of the guys
at the local p.d.

565
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:46,602
No. No good. If verone's got
some of them on the payroll,

566
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,702
then we can't let them know
our operation.

567
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:51,247
Exactly. In addition,

568
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:54,978
verone told us that he himself
would be waiting at the drop.

569
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:58,453
That's good news.
If you're gonna be
delivering drug money to him,

570
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:02,151
- then we can get him
for laundering.
- No, there's only one problem.

571
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:06,026
- What's that?
- Fuentes...
verone's tappin' her.

572
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,293
Tappin' her?
Tappin' her how?
That is crap!

573
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:11,800
What you talkin' about,
homeboy? We know what we seen.

574
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,702
What do you think, o'conner?
You think she's compromised?

575
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,468
- You should know.
- What's that supposed to mean?

576
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:20,476
What? You mean your old pal
o'conner didn't tell ya?

577
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:24,241
He flipped on bilkins in l.a.
Gave his mark his car keys
and let him disappear.

578
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,908
That's why he's not
a cop anymore.

579
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:30,880
So what do you think, expert?

580
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,056
Man, i don't know.

581
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,649
All right.
We'll keep an eye on her.

582
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,596
We're out of here.

583
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:50,629
You let your man go, huh?
Drop it. I don't
wanna talk about it.

584
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:53,835
Drop it, hell!
I wanna hear
about this, homey.

585
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:55,435
I said forget about it, cuz.

586
00:46:55,512 --> 00:47:00,609
We got fuentes in with verone,
markham tryin'
to blow our cover...

587
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:04,848
and we got two wired cars
that are no better than that
damn ankle bracelet of mine.

588
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:08,881
I'm-a tell you, brah.
You let your man markham do that
shit again in front of verone,

589
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:11,450
- that's gonna be our ass.
- I know, man. I know.

590
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:14,292
It's gettin' thick real quick,
and we may need a way out.

591
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:16,958
- We gotta come up with
some exit strategy.
- Exit strategy, huh?

592
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:19,025
Yeah.

593
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:22,636
I like the way that sounds.
What you got in mind?

594
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:26,142
I don't know, man.
But we need two more cars.

595
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:35,308
Yeah. Here they come.

596
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:58,472
Fonzie and fabio.
Glad you can join us.

597
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,409
We heard you boys
wanted to get rid
of those crackerjack toys.

598
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:04,413
No. Actually we just figured
those cars you got
deserved better drivers,

599
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,745
which is why we're gonna
take 'em off your hands.

600
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:09,115
- You know, why don't
we settle this now?
- Wait, wait.

601
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:11,450
How about we settle this
on the blacktop, huh?

602
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:13,921
Each car does it
down and back,
tag-team style...

603
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:17,119
for slips.
Loser walks home.

604
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:19,355
- We came to race.
- Well, load 'em up then.

605
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,635
Come on, bro.
Let's get these cars.

606
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,965
All right, check it out.
There's no way we gonna beat
these guys straight up.

607
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:33,407
The hemi's puttin' out
about 425...

608
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:37,174
and that yenko
will snap a speed on
about five seconds flat.

609
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,579
We're gonna have to pull
somethin' out of our ass.

610
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,711
The only thing i can think of
is save the spray for
the way back, the return trip.

611
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:46,187
Done deal.
All right.
Let's do this, bro.

612
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,281
I'm gettin'
that orange one.

613
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:51,885
[Laughs]
You ain't ready, fabio!

614
00:48:56,867 --> 00:49:01,668
All right. You each
got a barrel to go around
down at the end of the road.

615
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:05,504
The second wave gotta
sit tight till your partner
crosses this line right here.

616
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:08,567
First team to go
down and back twice
wins the race.

617
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:11,739
At which point,

618
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:15,478
the losers will
hand over them keys.

619
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:19,648
Otherwise, you'll be eatin'
breakfast through straws
from now on.

620
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:22,248
Comprende?

621
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:24,260
I get it.

622
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,924
Oh, this means you too.

623
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:30,558
- I got it.
- A'ight.

624
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,966
Let's race.

625
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:39,039
Come on, baby.!
You got this, rome.
Let's do it.

626
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:43,512
Hey, you gone, homey.
I got this. This is done.
[Laughs]

627
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,014
You about to lose
your car.

628
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:47,846
Do it, rome!
Come on.
You got it.

629
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,716
You think i'm worried
about this fool, man?
[Laughs]

630
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:53,779
This is nothin'.
[Engine revs]

631
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:56,348
[Engine revs, loud]

632
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:04,893
- Aw, no.
- American muscle.

633
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:11,334
Your engine ain't
as big as your mouth.
[Revs engine]

634
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:18,546
Gotta smoke 'em. Gotta
smoke 'em. Gotta smoke 'em.

635
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:21,675
All right, here we go.
It's all right, baby.
I'm gonna handle this.

636
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,777
Handle it.

637
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,482
Ready and... go!

638
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,596
You ain't ready.
I run these streets.

639
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,734
Woo-hoo!

640
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:48,107
Romey rome.
You ain't heard of me?

641
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:08,094
Oh, shit.

642
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:14,267
Oh, yeah!

643
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:21,200
I'm-a get you.
Oh, i'm-a get you!

644
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,145
Where's your
big mouth now, boy?

645
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:26,011
That car's going home
with me, homey.

646
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,789
[Laughs]

647
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:39,385
Oh, shit.
Eat this, sucker!

648
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,835
[Laughs]

649
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:54,971
Shit!

650
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:59,075
[Revs engine]

651
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:01,583
Yeah, boy!
Go, korpi!

652
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:07,980
Sorry, blondie.
How does that dust taste?

653
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,550
I don't know.

654
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,096
[Revs engine]
Come on, rome.

655
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:47,029
What the...

656
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:04,539
- [Engine stalls]
- Whoo!

657
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:12,044
Goddamn! Come on!
[Engine starts]

658
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,829
Come on, brian.
Bring it home, man.

659
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:09,378
Got two new cars!
That's all my man!

660
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:12,279
- Damn!
- [Laughs]

661
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,951
Y'all ain't ready, homeboy.
Get to walkin', fabio.

662
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:25,891
Use them bus tokens, partner.!

663
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,402
[Rap]
Hey, how you doin'?

664
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,802
Good. What you need?
We're guests
of mr. Verone's.

665
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:39,308
[Loud rap, indistinct]

666
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:41,469
[People chattering]

667
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:50,042
- It's a "hoasis"
in here, brah.
- Yeah.

668
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:55,558
Lots of potential.
[Chuckling]
Damn. You got a pen?

669
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:59,925
[Laughing]
Phew. It's about to
get serious, brah.

670
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:03,397
[Pearce]
Look at that girl
on the swing right there.

671
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,457
Hey. You guys
did something right.

672
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:09,938
- Verone never socializes
with hired help.
- Then what's that make you?

673
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:12,600
- Where's he at?
- He's on his way.

674
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:16,271
- You and verone don't go
everywhere together?
- What's that supposed to mean?

675
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:19,645
Nothin'.
[Sighs]

676
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:22,150
Huh. I'm-a go
take a piss.

677
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:24,209
You go do that.

678
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:32,759
What is his deal?
He doesn't trust people
that carry badges.

679
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,525
So you talk
like you know.

680
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:39,728
Yeah.
I'd been a cop
about two months...

681
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:42,101
when roman was busted
in a garage raid.

682
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:45,699
He had eight sets of wheels
in his possession, each
and every one of them hot.

683
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:49,905
So you busted him?
No. I didn't even know
what was goin' down.

684
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:52,880
But, uh, that doesn't
really matter to him.

685
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:55,440
Basically, once
i became a cop,

686
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,918
roman started
seeing me as a friend
that became the enemy.

687
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,189
You have a little...

688
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:07,156
is there anything
i can get for you,
mr. Verone?

689
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,289
Just tell 'em
to comejoin me.

690
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,857
[Continues]

691
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:17,563
Oh, yeah.
I was admiring this.

692
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,438
Yeah, i was looking
at it earlier.

693
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,501
[Continues, indistinct]

694
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,949
- Damn.
- I wasn't about
to give it to you.

695
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:34,114
What's up?
He's here, man.

696
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,284
Where's he at?
He's over there.
Don't look.

697
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:45,195
Excuse me.
Mr. Verone would like
for you to join him.

698
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:47,259
Let's do it.

699
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:49,328
See what i'm talkin' about?

700
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,934
[Verone]
It's all right.
Let 'em in.

701
00:56:57,347 --> 00:57:00,646
Go sit down.
I'll talk to you
in a second.

702
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:02,844
How ya doin'?
Good. You enjoying
your night?

703
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,910
Yeah. I'm havin'
a good time.
Good, good.

704
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:10,787
She's beautiful,
isn't she?

705
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:17,792
Hmm?
Yeah.

706
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,858
She's gorgeous.

707
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:28,870
You got balls, kid.
[Chuckles]

708
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,413
I can appreciate that.

709
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:35,247
Women are a very
powerful force.

710
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:39,516
You see the blond
sitting with
the gentleman right here?

711
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:43,150
[Chattering]

712
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:47,856
Five minutes of her time,
and she can get anything
she wants from him.

713
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:50,331
- I love your hair.
- Watch.

714
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:56,762
[Chuckling]

715
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,365
I wonder where
they're going.
Sit down.

716
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:05,506
So, you, uh, lit my man's
car on fire. Is that right?

717
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:10,347
Yeah. I did.

718
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:15,755
You see, i got a problem
with authority.

719
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:20,194
Hmm. I have
that same problem.

720
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:24,427
For me, it's cops
in particular.

721
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:34,740
[Chuckles]

722
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:39,208
Let's take a walk.
Come on.
We just got here.

723
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,273
Now we're leaving.

724
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,343
Let's go.

725
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:54,060
Hey. Come on.

726
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:18,410
What's all that?

727
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:23,653
We're gonna have
a little fun.
[Cork pops softly]

728
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:27,919
[Glass clinks]
[Champagne pouring]

729
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:30,465
- Hmm.
- [Monica]
Thank you.

730
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:34,560
[Chattering]

731
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:37,470
Let's just stay
a little longer.
[Indistinct]

732
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:40,600
- [Chuckling]
- Hey, carter.

733
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:43,111
Meet, uh,
detective whitworth.

734
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:49,910
One of miami's finest.
Thank you, sweetheart.

735
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:53,922
Are you enjoying
yourself, detective?
Yeah. I was.

736
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,652
I mean, you know me.

737
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:59,661
Yeah, i do know you.

738
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:05,131
- You been on my payroll
a long time.
- Verone, that ain't right.

739
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:08,136
Shut up.

740
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:11,332
I got one last job
for you, detective.
You hear me?

741
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:13,398
Look, we've been
all through this.
Yeah?

742
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:16,445
Yeah. I said
i can't do it.

743
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:20,346
Hmm. That's
the wrong answer.
The table.

744
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:24,582
[Grunting]

745
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:28,920
I'm a detective, verone!
You do anything to me,

746
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:32,257
the whole force is gonna
be on your ass
in a minute.

747
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:35,820
Shut your mouth!
You fat piece of shit.

748
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:37,729
You can stop right now.

749
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:43,602
[Whitworth mutters]
[Squeaking]

750
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:46,164
- What the hell...
what the hell is that?
- Sit down.

751
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,776
You're gonna regret this.
Just stop right now!

752
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:53,009
Once the bucket
gets hot enough,
detective,

753
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:55,414
the rat is gonna
want out.

754
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,248
Get...

755
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,187
and the only direction
it can go is south.

756
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:04,425
Hey! Get...
hey!

757
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,291
Hold that.
[Gasping]

758
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:10,560
- Get it off me!
I'll forget it ever happened.
- Shut up.

759
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:14,069
Did you know that
your average rat...
[rat squeaking]

760
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:17,129
Can chew through
a steel drain pipe?

761
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:20,607
You see, you have nothing
to worry about when he's
screaming, detective.

762
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:23,737
It's when he goes quiet
that he goes to work.

763
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:26,577
[Whitworth]
Stop it.! Stop it.!
Stop it.!

764
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:29,982
Don't be stupid.
Stop it now.

765
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:33,887
You're in charge of the units
that are watching
my properties, huh?

766
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:36,322
What i want is,
i want a 15-minute window...

767
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:38,826
where everybody...
and i mean everybody...
disappears.

768
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:41,762
You hear me?
I can't do it!

769
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:43,992
[Moaning, whimpering]

770
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:47,833
- [Gasping] stop it.
I can't do it. Help.!
- Okay. Monica, come here.

771
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:51,305
- Help.! Help.!
- Shut him up.
Shut him up.

772
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,400
Help! Help!

[Squeaking]
Help.!

774
01:01:56,412 --> 01:01:59,176
Help! Help!

775
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:01,944
[Muffled groaning]
He's biting me!

776
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:04,509
- Help.! Help.!
- What?

777
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:07,488
[Muffled shouting,
screaming]

778
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,923
- You got somethin'
you wanna say?
- [Muffled screaming]

779
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:12,586
He bit me!
[Groaning]

780
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:15,927
- Yes, i'll do it.!
- Do what? Say it.

781
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,193
I'll do it.
I'll give you your window.

782
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:21,964
[Gasping, whimpering]
Just get it off me!

783
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:25,439
[Groaning]
Get it off.

784
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:27,942
You betray me,

785
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:30,672
and my rat here...

786
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,977

your wife, lynn... yeah...

787
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:36,450
your son, clay,
and your daughter, lexi.

788
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:39,317
Do you hear me?
You understand me? Huh?

789
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:41,117
You hear me?
Yes.

790
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:43,556
I'll burn your... eyes out!
I'll burn 'em out!

791
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:46,652
[Whimpering]
Get it off me.

792
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:50,722
Good. Now you can go.
Get it off me.

793
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:54,065
Get rid ofhim.
Let's go.
Get if off.

794
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:56,469
[Grunting]

795
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:03,875
Mm. You boys
enjoy the show?

796
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:08,744
Fifteen minutes, and then
every cop in florida
is gonna be on you.

797
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:12,686
Be at versailles cafe,
6:00 a.m., day after tomorrow,
ready to drive.

798
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:14,882
- You understand?
- Yeah.

799
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:20,020
Don't play games with me,
or you'll be next. All right?

800
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:23,395
Help yourself
to a little champagne.
Let's go.

801
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:26,333
[Rap, indistinct]

802
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:28,336
That was
a damn rat, man.

803
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:30,395
Hey.

804
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:42,980
You ever... touch
another man again,
and i'll kill you.

805
01:03:43,052 --> 01:03:46,283
You hear me?
Look at me.

806
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:48,346
You hear me?

807
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:58,157
She was into it, man.
What's that about?

808
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,759
And you seen the way
she grabbed
the dude's head.

809
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:03,601
She had to, man.
He was testing her.
You gotta remember,

810
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:06,267
her ass is on the line,
just like ours.

811
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,367
You feelin' this girl
way too much.

812
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:12,175
She just like that
crazy-ass trailer-raff
from back-in-the-day, tonya.

813
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:16,617
Tonya? Man, you
went out with her
after i did.

814
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,813
I mean, i couldn't
let her go to waste.

815
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:20,947
[Jimmy]
I got you, i got you,
i got you.

816
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:23,992
Is that right?
See, we can race
for cash,

817
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:28,156
but when i step on the gas,
my nitrous go blast,
leave your ass in the past.

818
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:31,826
And, tej, you about
to lose your garage.
Whatever, man.

819
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:34,995
I'm a low-budget mechanic,
but i overcharge.

820
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,063
Pay me!
Let's go, man!
[Laughing]

821
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:40,131
Pay me my money.
I told you, man.

822
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:42,200
You a happy man.
I'm so glad.

823
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:44,371
This is my garage, boy.
Royal flush!

824
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:46,506
Give me this, man.
Holler, huh! Yes!

825
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:49,142
Did i talk to him?
Talk to him.
[Suki] damn.

826
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:52,949
You can't play a player. Put
that money back on the table.
You know it's my next hand.

827
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:55,786
Jimmy, how you
gonna pay me back
if you keep losing to tej?

828
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:57,917
How ya doin', bro?
I'm gonna crash, tej.

829
01:04:57,994 --> 01:04:59,985
I'll catch you tomorrow.
A'ight, boy.

830
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:14,199
[Door opens]
[Soft footsteps]

831
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:16,108
[Gasping]

832
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:19,170
- What are you doin' here?
- Brian, they're gonna
kill you.

833
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,682
I heard him telling
enrique and roberto.

834
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:25,517
Once you finish the run, they're
putting a bullet in your head.

835
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:30,184
- You sure
you heard 'em right?
- I'm sure. I'm sure.

836
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:38,527
- [Knock]
- Verone's boys is outs...

837
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:41,570

they lookin'for...
your little girlfriend here.

838
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:50,243
- They don't know i'm here.
I snuck out.
- What are they doin' here then?

839
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:54,511
I don't know.
Maybe they're guessing.
Hey, go stall them.

840
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:57,916
- Go stall them
for two minutes.
- Check her, homey. Check her.

841
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,783
Find what you was
lookin' for?

842
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:11,662
Hey, buddy. Hi, guys.

Don't even trip, homey.

You can't take a joke?

845
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:22,937
Brian, this isn't about
being a good cop anymore
or-or doing your job.

846
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:25,071
They're gonna kill you.
You guys gotta pull out.

847
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:27,274
Verone pay y'all to keep
a straight face like that?

848
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:31,343
'Cause if i was makin'money,
shit, i'd get that mole
removed off my damn nose.

849
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,752
Okay? Okay.

01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,848
How much

Every time i see y'all, man,

01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:42,259
jewelry, you know,

853
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,663
You know? I caught you

854
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:49,068

855
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:52,039
Don't make that run, brian.
Don't make that run.

856
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:54,099
Be careful.

857
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,873
- Donde esta?

858
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:00,848

Hey, hey! Where you goin'?
You stay right here

861
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:21,635
Don't even think

862
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:36,281
Vamonos.!
Stay your ass off
my homeboy's boat.

863
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:41,280
[Trigger cocks]

864
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,619
Put the gun down!
Put the gun down now!

865
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:47,787
You first, asshole!
You first!

866

Put the gun down!

867
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,200
[Spanish]

868
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:54,998
- [Spanish]
- Tu primero.!

869
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,096
- Put down the gun now!
- [Spanish]

870
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:59,801
- [Spanish]
- Put down the gun!

871
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:01,866
[All shouting, indistinct]
Enough.

872
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:03,935
- Enough. Shut up.
- [Spanish]

873
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:07,210
Shut up.
It's over. Come on.

874
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:11,182
[Verone]
It's over. Let's go.

875
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,915
Let's have the gun. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

876
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:21,659
I'm glad to see you boys
are getting along so well.

877
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:24,756
Because tomorrow,
roberto and enrique...

878
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:26,825
are gonna be
riding along with you...

879
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:28,961
just so that we don't
have any problems.

880
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:31,029
I'll see you guys
in a bit.

881
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:37,468
What the hell was she
doin' in there, man?

882
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:50,450
Where'd you go
this morning?

883
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:52,517
I went to breakfast
with some friends.

884
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:01,698
- With friends.
- [Chuckles]

885
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,761
I do have friends, carter.

886
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:09,734
[Chuckling]

887
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:14,712
Okay.
I'll see you later.

888
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:27,595
- Nice shirt, bilkins.
- It's my day off.

889
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:32,191
Yeah. Well, anyhow,
this is the deal.

890
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:35,328
Last night,
verone threatened a cop
into giving us a window.

891
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:39,306
We're driving to an airstrip,
in the keys,
off of nallwood avenue.

892
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:41,843
Verone has a plane there,
and he's taking off
for good.

893
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:44,778
- Wait a minute.
How do you know this?
- Monica.

894
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:48,442
She's doin' her job.
She warned us.

895
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:52,248
- She warned you about what?
- Verone plans to kill us
after we give him the money.

896
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:55,119
Driving into an ambush
was never part of the deal.

897
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:58,752
I'm calling this off.
Like hell you are. This
is a customs case, bilkins.

898
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:01,694
No one's calling this off
unless i do.

899
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:04,062
Look. This is real simple.

900
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:06,158
You make the run.
You get verone
and his cash together...

901
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:08,169
so i can move in
for the bust.

902
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:11,570
All right? You don't, i will
find enough charges on both
of you to make you disappear.

903
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,575
Take these. We're gonna
have g.p.s. On you
the whole time...

904
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:16,634
to make sure you don't
get any cute ideas.

905
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:20,113
- And to make sure nothing
happens to them, right?
- Yeah, right.

906
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:32,121
The guy's a dick, man.
Yep.

907
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:36,458
Let me get this right.

908
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:39,524
If we don't do this,
then we go to jail.

909
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:42,594
But if we do it, then
verone's gonna kill us.

910
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:44,832
It's a hell of a deal,
huh?

911
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:48,240
Yeah. Maybe it is.

912
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:52,203
But i know this guy's
got an ass full of loot...

913
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:54,943
that he's ready
to dump in our cars.

914
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:58,976
And i can think of two reasons
why verone doesn't need
that money anymore.

915
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:01,716
- Ah, here we go.
- You and me.

916
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:04,987
Just like the old days.
What do you think?

917
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:08,518
I think they messed with
the wrong two guys.
That's what i think.

918
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,630
Yo, tej.
What's up, bro?
What up?

919
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:15,829
Hey, man, how quickly
can you organize?

920
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:18,065
[Tej] look, folk,
if y'all really wanna
carry out this plan,

921
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,631
it's definitely
the best place to do it.

922
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:24,167
What do y'all think, man?
I think it's perfect.
What do they store here?

923
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:26,510
Pump, p-p-pump, pump
p-p-p-pump

924
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:28,948
pump, p-p-pump

925
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:31,851
pump, p-p-pump
pump, p-pump, p-pump
hey, man, this thing's clean.

926
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,911
Pump it up
just blaze
strip it down.

927
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:37,823
Pump, p-p-pump, pump it up
we gonna do it like
uh, uh, uh

928
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:40,691
look, pump it up if you came
to get it krunk with a dame
and shit that's drunk

929
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:44,221
you came to get it on
more than five o's
in your bank

930
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,734
then get it on
roll up like that stank

931
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:48,793
slank that fitted on
came to get it on
hey, jimmy.

932
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:52,204
Yeah. What up?
We have any half-empty bottles
of nitrous laying around?

933
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:54,834
Sure, but i already
loaded you for spray.

934
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:57,140
No. I'm thinkin'
we may need it
for somethin' else,

935
01:11:57,212 --> 01:12:00,511
'cause our cars may get
a little crowded,
you know?

936
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:04,742
Pump, p-p-pump
pump it up

937
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:10,448
man, when you start
eatin' so much?

938
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:14,488
I was in jail, brah.

939
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:16,861
I know how shitty
the grub is
on the inside.

940
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:20,424
[Laughing]
With the way things is shapin'
up out here right now,

941
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:24,165
it'll be a matter of time
before i'm back in there
or dead.

942
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:28,468
So i'm tryin' to eat
all i can while i can.

943
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:33,674
Plus the doctor tell me
i got a high metabolism.

944
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:35,740
[Laughing]

945
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:40,144
Man, you remember us
growing up?

946
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:44,215
You know, playing
football in the dirt.

947
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:46,659
You know, gettin' in trouble,
all the stupid things we did.

948
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:51,997
When you got busted, you know,
whether i was a cop or not,

949
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:55,093
you know, if there was
anything i could've done,

950
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:58,901
i would've done it,
and i just want you
to know that.

951
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,570
Is that why you let
that dude go in l.a.?

952
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:06,904
Yeah. I think that had
a lot to do with it.

953
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:13,816
When i got busted,
it wasn't your fault.

954
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:18,519
It was all on me,
mr. Roman pearce...

955
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:20,960
wild-and-out crazy, man.

956
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:23,756
No one can tell me
nothin;

957
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:27,666
- ridin' solo.
- Yeah, well, not anymore.

958
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:35,366
Not anymore, bro.

959
01:14:00,736 --> 01:14:03,034
I got verone's navigator
leavin' the residence.

960
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:06,939
Copy. Sir, we've got
verone on the move
to the airstrip.

961
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:10,206
Good. Let's get a bird
in the air. Tell him
to keep his distance.

962
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,372
[Chattering]

963
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,645
Good and tight.
Ready to go.
Channel two. Channel two.

[Static crackles]
What's goin'on out there?

968
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,827
- Team one checking in.
