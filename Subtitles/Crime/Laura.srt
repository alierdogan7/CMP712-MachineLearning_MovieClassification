1
00:00:53,193 --> 00:00:57,531
I shall never forget
the weekend Laura died.

2
00:00:57,614 --> 00:01:03,328
A silver sun burned through the sky
like a huge magnifying glass.

3
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:07,624
It was the hottest Sunday
in my recollection.

4
00:01:07,707 --> 00:01:11,753
I felt as if I were the only human being
left in New York.

5
00:01:13,588 --> 00:01:17,050
For with Laura's
horrible death, I was alone.

6
00:01:18,552 --> 00:01:21,471
I, Waldo Lydecker...

7
00:01:21,555 --> 00:01:24,558
was the only one
who really knew her...

8
00:01:26,143 --> 00:01:30,230
and I had just begun
to write Laura's story when...

9
00:01:30,355 --> 00:01:33,608
another of those detectives
came to see me.

10
00:01:34,693 --> 00:01:36,653
I had him wait.

11
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:42,534
I could watch him
through the half-open door.

12
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:59,050
I noted that his attention
was fixed upon my clock.

13
00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:02,679
There was only one other
in existence...

14
00:02:02,763 --> 00:02:05,432
and that was
in Laura's apartment...

15
00:02:05,557 --> 00:02:08,435
in the very room
where she was murdered.

16
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:15,484
Careful there.
That stuff is priceless.

17
00:02:16,693 --> 00:02:18,653
Come in here, please.

18
00:02:25,452 --> 00:02:27,329
Mr. Lydecker?

19
00:02:27,454 --> 00:02:29,790
Ah, you recognize me.
How splendid.

20
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:31,875
Sit down, please.

21
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,172
Nice little place
you have here, Mr. Lydecker.

22
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:40,425
It's lavish,
but I call it home.

23
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,595
I suppose you're here
about the Laura Hunt murder.

24
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,931
Yesterday morning,
after Laura's body was found...

25
00:02:46,014 --> 00:02:49,309
I was questioned
by Sergeants McAvity and Schultz...

26
00:02:49,392 --> 00:02:51,353
and I stated...

27
00:02:51,478 --> 00:02:54,606
"On Friday night, Laura had a dinner
engagement with me...

28
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:58,026
"after which she was ostensibly
going out of town.

29
00:02:58,151 --> 00:03:02,280
"She phoned and canceled
our engagement at exactly 7:00.

30
00:03:02,364 --> 00:03:04,324
- After that I..."
- You "ate a lonely dinner...

31
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:07,661
then got into the tub to read."

32
00:03:07,744 --> 00:03:09,663
Why did you
write it down?

33
00:03:09,746 --> 00:03:11,998
Afraid you'd forget it?

34
00:03:12,082 --> 00:03:15,669
I am the most widely
misquoted man in America.

35
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:18,296
When my friends do it,
I resent it.

36
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,758
From Sergeants McAvity and Schultz,
I should find it intolerable.

37
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:24,553
Hand me that washcloth,
please, Mr. -

38
00:03:24,678 --> 00:03:26,847
Mr. -

39
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:28,849
McPherson.

40
00:03:28,974 --> 00:03:31,685
McPherson. McPherson.

41
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:34,521
Mark McPherson-
the siege of Babylon, Long Island.

42
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:37,023
The gangster with the machine gun.
Killed three policemen.

43
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:39,568
I told the story over the air
and wrote a column about it.

44
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:41,653
Are you the one
with the leg full of lead...

45
00:03:41,736 --> 00:03:44,030
- the man who walked right in and got him?
- Yeah.

46
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:46,867
Well, well.
Hand me my robe, please.

47
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:53,957
You have a pretty good memory,
Mr. Lydecker.

48
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,878
I always liked that detective
with the silver shinbone.

49
00:03:57,961 --> 00:04:02,215
Thanks. I hope you won't have any reason
to change your mind about me.

50
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:05,260
- Have you any more questions?
- Yeah, just one.

51
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:07,804
Two years ago,
in your October 17 column...

52
00:04:07,888 --> 00:04:10,056
you started out
to write a book review...

53
00:04:10,182 --> 00:04:13,727
but at the bottom of the column, you
switched over to the Harrington murder case.

54
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:18,023
Are the processes of the creative mind
now under the jurisdiction of the police?

55
00:04:18,106 --> 00:04:22,903
You said Harrington was rubbed out with
a shotgun loaded with buckshot...

56
00:04:22,986 --> 00:04:25,739
the way Laura Hunt was murdered
night before last.

57
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:27,741
- Did I?
- Yeah.

58
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:30,827
But he was really killed
with a sash weight.

59
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:34,831
How ordinary.
My version was obviously superior.

60
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:36,917
I never bother
with details, you know.

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,920
I do. Well, so long.

62
00:04:41,004 --> 00:04:43,423
Mind if I go with you?

63
00:04:43,507 --> 00:04:46,927
- What for?
- Murder is my favorite crime.

64
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:49,054
I write about it regularly...

65
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:52,224
and I know you'll have to visit everyone
on your list of suspects.

66
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:55,352
I'd like to study
their reactions.

67
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:58,230
- You're on the list yourself, you know.
- Good.

68
00:04:58,313 --> 00:05:01,775
To have overlooked me
would have been a pointed insult.

69
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,570
You're not the sort of man
one would insult, Mr. Lydecker.

70
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:08,615
- Do you really suspect me?
- Yes.

71
00:05:08,698 --> 00:05:12,702
McPherson, if you know anything
about faces, look at mine.

72
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:18,375
How singularly innocent
I look this morning.

73
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,461
Have you ever seen
such candid eyes?

74
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:29,344
Something you confiscated
in a raid on a kindergarten?

75
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:33,640
Takes a lot of control.
Would you like to try it?

76
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:36,101
No, thanks.

77
00:05:36,184 --> 00:05:38,979
Were you in love
with Laura Hunt, Mr. Lydecker?

78
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:43,984
Was she in love with you?

79
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:46,445
Laura considered me
the wisest, the wittiest...

80
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:49,573
the most interesting man
she'd ever met.

81
00:05:49,656 --> 00:05:52,367
I was in complete accord
with her on that point.

82
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:55,454
She thought me also
the kindest...

83
00:05:55,537 --> 00:05:57,706
the gentlest...

84
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:00,208
the most sympathetic man
in the world.

85
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,878
Did you agree
with her there too?

86
00:06:03,003 --> 00:06:05,338
McPherson,
you won't understand this...

87
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:10,135
but I tried to become
the kindest, the gentlest...

88
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:13,346
the most sympathetic man
in the world.

89
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:15,891
Have any luck?

90
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:19,144
Let me put it this way.

91
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:23,732
I should be sincerely sorry to see my
neighbors' children devoured by wolves.

92
00:06:23,857 --> 00:06:25,817
Shall we go?

93
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:51,343
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning, Mrs. Treadwell.

94
00:06:51,426 --> 00:06:53,345
- Waldo.
- Good morning, Ann.

95
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:56,723
- I've just taken over the Laura Hunt case.
- Won't you sit down?

96
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:59,142
Thanks. I have
all the reports...

97
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:01,561
but there are a few more questions
I'd like to ask.

98
00:07:01,686 --> 00:07:03,647
Certainly. I'll do anything
I can to help.

99
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,774
You were fond of your niece,
Mrs. Treadwell?

100
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:07,859
Why, I adored her.
Cigarette?

101
00:07:07,984 --> 00:07:10,821
No, thanks. You collapsed when
you identified the body.

102
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:14,950
I can quite understand that. A shotgun
loaded with buckshot, close range.

103
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:18,161
- It's not very nice to look at.
- It was horrible.

104
00:07:18,245 --> 00:07:20,872
Her maid Bessie, I suppose
she was devoted to Miss Hunt?

105
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:24,251
Oh, she worshipped her.
Laura had had her for years.

106
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:27,462
I'll never forget her scream
when she saw Laura lying there.

107
00:07:27,587 --> 00:07:31,508
Did you approve of Miss Hunt's coming
marriage to Mr. Carpenter?

108
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:35,220
Why? Shouldn't I approve?

109
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:39,391
I don't know. What is your relationship
with Mr. Carpenter?

110
00:07:39,516 --> 00:07:41,476
What do you mean?

111
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:44,563
What I mean is, he's been
a frequent guest in your home.

112
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:47,357
Is he an acquaintance? Friend?
Are you in love with him?

113
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:49,734
This is beginning to assume
fabulous aspects.

114
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:52,571
Oh, shut up, Waldo!
What are you driving at?

115
00:07:52,654 --> 00:07:55,449
The truth, Mrs. Treadwell.
Are you in love with him?

116
00:07:57,784 --> 00:08:01,746
Why, no. I'm... I'm very fond
of Mr. Carpenter, of course.

117
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:04,166
- Everybody is.
- I'm not. I'll be hanged if I am.

118
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,626
Oh, don't be
so annoying, Waldo!

119
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,712
Did you give
Mr. Carpenter money?

120
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:12,883
- What do you mean?
- A couple of checks went through your account endorsed by him.

121
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:17,721
One on May 15 for $250.
One on May 22 for $400.

122
00:08:17,804 --> 00:08:21,016
Oh, that. I...

123
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:23,810
I asked him to do
some shopping for me. That's all.

124
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:25,896
Shelby's a very obliging fellow.

125
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,733
For some time, also, you've been
withdrawing various amounts in cash.

126
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:31,902
Sometimes 1,500.

127
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:34,946
Sometimes 1,700 at a clip.

128
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,324
Yes. I needed that money.

129
00:08:38,742 --> 00:08:43,872
The day you took out $1,500,
Mr. Carpenter deposited 1,350.

130
00:08:43,997 --> 00:08:47,250
When you withdrew 1,700,
he deposited 1,550.

131
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:49,336
Maybe they were shooting crap.

132
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:51,963
Oh, must I be insulted like this?

133
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:58,345
I'm sorry, Mrs. Treadwell, but I have
to find out about these things.

134
00:08:58,428 --> 00:09:03,100
Shelby needed some money, and I lent it to
him. That's all. After all, it is my money.

135
00:09:03,183 --> 00:09:05,727
- I suppose I can do as I please with it.
- Sure. Of course.

136
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:08,814
Now, on Friday night, Mrs. Treadwell,
you stayed home alone all evening?

137
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:11,942
- Yes.
- Why didn't you go to the concert with Shelby?

138
00:09:13,193 --> 00:09:15,195
Because he didn't ask me.

139
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:17,364
We were just talking
about you, Carpenter.

140
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:20,325
- What a coincidence to find you here.
- This is Lieutenant McPherson.

141
00:09:20,408 --> 00:09:23,995
- Oh, how do you do, Lieutenant?
- I didn't know you were here, Mr. Carpenter.

142
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:26,706
As a matter of fact,
I was just lying down here.

143
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:30,502
My hotel room was so hot, and then all
the people and reporters and telephone.

144
00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:32,546
You know how it is,
Lieutenant.

145
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,465
I've hardly slept a wink
since it happened.

146
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:38,176
Is that a sign of guilt or innocence,
McPherson?

147
00:09:38,301 --> 00:09:41,847
I'm at your disposal, Lieutenant. I'm as
eager to find the murderer as you are.

148
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,433
But what possible motive
could I have for killing Laura?

149
00:09:44,558 --> 00:09:47,436
Miss Hunt and I were going to be married
this week, you know.

150
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:49,604
No, he doesn't know,
and neither do I...

151
00:09:49,729 --> 00:09:53,191
- or you or anyone else alive.
- What do you mean by that?

152
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:56,319
Laura had not definitely made up
her mind to marry him.

153
00:09:56,403 --> 00:10:00,407
She told me so herself last Friday when she
called up to cancel our dinner engagement.

154
00:10:00,532 --> 00:10:04,035
As a matter of fact, she was going
to the country to think it over.

155
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:06,538
She was extremely kind,
but I was always sure...

156
00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:10,876
she would never have thrown her life
away on a male beauty in distress.

157
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,044
I suppose you've heard
losers whine before...

158
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,130
especially in your
profession, eh?

159
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:17,132
Would you like
a bite of lunch, Lieutenant?

160
00:10:17,257 --> 00:10:19,259
That's very thoughtful...
the perfect host.

161
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:21,678
- Waldo.
- You'd almost think he was in his own home.

162
00:10:21,762 --> 00:10:25,098
Shelby knows how distracted I am.
Would you, Lieutenant?

163
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:27,601
Thank you, Mrs. Treadwell,
but I've got to be going.

164
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:31,438
But, Lieutenant, I... Well, I rather thought
you'd want to ask me some questions.

165
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:34,816
Oh, yes. What did they play
at the concert Friday night?

166
00:10:34,941 --> 00:10:37,652
Oh, Brahms's First
and Beethoven's Ninth.

167
00:10:37,778 --> 00:10:41,114
Uh-huh. Have you got a key
to Miss Hunt's house up in the country?

168
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:43,992
No, but I think there's one
up in her apartment.

169
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:46,578
- Okay, I'll have a look.
- Perhaps I could help you?

170
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:48,622
All right. Come along.

171
00:10:48,747 --> 00:10:51,166
I'll be seeing you,
Mrs. Treadwell.

172
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:58,507
Extra! Extra!
Girl victim in brutal slaying!

173
00:10:58,632 --> 00:11:00,967
Extra! Girl victim
in brutal slaying!

174
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,595
Read all about it!
Girl victim in brutal slaying!

175
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,389
Girl victim
in brutal slaying! Read all about it!

176
00:11:11,812 --> 00:11:13,855
All right.
Break it up. Break it up.

177
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:16,983
Ice-cold drinks!

178
00:11:43,677 --> 00:11:46,388
- The doorbell rang.
- What?

179
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:49,766
As she opened the door,
the shot was fired.

180
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,852
And how do you deduce that?

181
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,980
She fell backward.
The body was there.

182
00:11:56,398 --> 00:11:59,359
I thought you hadn't
been up here before.

183
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:01,403
I saw the police photos.

184
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:12,789
I guess I better
try and find that key.

185
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:18,253
McPherson, tell me, why did they have to
photograph her in that horrible condition?

186
00:12:18,378 --> 00:12:21,006
When a dame gets killed,
she doesn't worry about how she looks.

187
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:24,009
Will you stop calling her a dame?
Look around.

188
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:27,804
Is this the home of a dame?

189
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,558
Look at her.

190
00:12:34,686 --> 00:12:37,105
Not bad.

191
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,150
Jacoby was in love with her
when he painted it...

192
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:42,444
but he never captured
her vibrance, her warmth.

193
00:12:44,362 --> 00:12:46,865
Have you ever been in love?

194
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,951
A doll in Washington Heights
once got a fox fur out of me.

195
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:53,455
Ever know a woman who wasn't
a "doll" or a "dame"?

196
00:12:55,665 --> 00:12:59,336
Yeah, one, but she kept walking me
past furniture windows...

197
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:02,589
to look at the parlor suites.

198
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:05,425
- Would you mind turning that off?
- Why? Don't you like it?

199
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,304
It was one of Laura's favorites.
Not exactly classical, but sweet.

200
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:12,349
- You know a lot about music?
- I don't know a lot about anything...

201
00:13:12,432 --> 00:13:14,518
but I know a little
about practically everything.

202
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:16,728
Yeah? Then why did you say...

203
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:20,899
they played Brahms's First and Beethoven's
Ninth at the concert Friday night?

204
00:13:20,982 --> 00:13:24,236
They changed the program at the last
minute and played nothing but Sibelius.

205
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:26,780
I suppose I should have
told you in the first place.

206
00:13:26,863 --> 00:13:29,449
I'd been working on that
advertising campaign with Laura.

207
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:32,828
Well, we'd been working so hard, I...
I just couldn't keep my eyes open.

208
00:13:32,953 --> 00:13:35,497
I didn't hear a note at the concert.
I fell asleep.

209
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:38,500
Next he'll produce
photographic evidence of his dreams.

210
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,628
I know it sounds suspicious,
but I'm resigned to that by now.

211
00:13:41,753 --> 00:13:45,298
I'm a natural-born suspect just because
I'm not the conventional type.

212
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,634
I wouldn't worry about it,
Mr. Carpenter.

213
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,096
It sounds reasonable.
I fall asleep at concerts myself.

214
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:53,140
Thank you.

215
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:56,059
You found
that key yet?

216
00:13:56,143 --> 00:14:00,564
No. I looked for it in the den,
but it wasn't there. It may be in here.

217
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:09,614
Yes, here it is.

218
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:12,159
I knew there must be
one around somewhere.

219
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:14,745
The police are very fussy
about their inventories.

220
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:18,248
That key isn't on the list of things
that were in that drawer yesterday.

221
00:14:18,331 --> 00:14:20,834
Then it's made
a recent reappearance.

222
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:23,211
You put it there,
didn't you?

223
00:14:23,336 --> 00:14:25,714
- Yes.
- Why?

224
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,050
It's just that I didn't want to give it
to you while Waldo was present.

225
00:14:29,176 --> 00:14:31,845
- Oh.
- I have private reasons that don't concern him.

226
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,847
Everything about Laura
concerns me.

227
00:14:33,972 --> 00:14:37,851
You have private reasons,
no doubt, to lie about the key.

228
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:40,979
Waldo, for your own good,
I'm warning you to stop implying...

229
00:14:41,104 --> 00:14:43,356
that I had anything to do
with Laura's death.

230
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,859
Very well.
I'll stop implying.

231
00:14:45,984 --> 00:14:47,861
I'll make
a direct statement.

232
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:49,863
All right,
you asked for it.

233
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:52,866
I wouldn't.

234
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:55,452
Will you please stop dawdling
with that infernal puzzle?

235
00:14:55,535 --> 00:14:59,831
- It's getting on my nerves.
- I know, but it keeps me calm.

236
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:02,000
Okay, let's go.

237
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,684
This was our table...

238
00:15:19,768 --> 00:15:21,770
Laura's and mine.

239
00:15:23,146 --> 00:15:25,273
We spent many quiet evenings
here together.

240
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:30,654
I remember we dined here the night
before her 22nd birthday.

241
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,074
Just we two...

242
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,953
happy, making plans
for her future.

243
00:15:39,746 --> 00:15:42,207
- Good luck.
But this was a far cry...

244
00:15:42,332 --> 00:15:47,045
from the girl who walked into my life
at the Algonquin Hotel five years before.

245
00:15:48,422 --> 00:15:50,757
Pardon me.
Excuse me.

246
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:54,970
Excuse me.

247
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:07,065
Mr. Lydecker,
how do you do?

248
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,735
My name is Laura Hunt,
and I'm with Bullitt and Company.

249
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:13,113
You know,
the big advertising firm.

250
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:16,116
And I'd like to talk
something over with you, if I may.

251
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:20,412
You can hardly fail to realize that
I am engaged in eating my lunch.

252
00:16:20,537 --> 00:16:24,291
Yes, I know. I'm awfully sorry
to interrupt this way...

253
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,461
but it's so hard to get to see you
the regular way, and...

254
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,546
this will only
take a minute, really.

255
00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:34,509
- Now, this is...
- Young woman...

256
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:38,847
either you have been raised
in some incredibly rustic community...

257
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:40,891
where good manners
are unknown...

258
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:43,393
or you suffer from the common
feminine delusion...

259
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:45,479
that the mere fact
of being a woman...

260
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:48,523
exempts you from the rules
of civilized conduct.

261
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:51,651
Or possibly both.

262
00:16:51,735 --> 00:16:54,529
Possibly, but here's
what I wanted to show you.

263
00:16:54,654 --> 00:16:56,656
It's for
the Wallace Flow-Rite pen.

264
00:16:56,782 --> 00:17:00,952
I know my company would be glad to pay
you $5,000 if you'll endorse the ad.

265
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:02,954
I don't use a pen.

266
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:05,165
I write with a goose quill
dipped in venom.

267
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,210
Yes, but this is a very fine pen,
Mr. Lydecker...

268
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:10,212
the best on the market.

269
00:17:10,337 --> 00:17:12,964
Wouldn't you at least
consider endorsing it?

270
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:17,344
I'll neither consider, endorse
or use the Wallace pen.

271
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,638
I hate pens.

272
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:23,016
If your employers wish me to publish
that statement in my column...

273
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:25,811
you may tell them that I shall be
delighted to oblige.

274
00:17:25,936 --> 00:17:29,981
Oh, no.
You mustn't do that.

275
00:17:30,107 --> 00:17:32,234
Don't blame Bullitt and Company,
Mr. Lydecker.

276
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:35,987
They don't know anything about this.
It was my idea to see you.

277
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,949
Indeed?

278
00:17:39,032 --> 00:17:43,370
Yes. I know they'd give anything down
at the office to get your endorsement...

279
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:45,622
only they think
there's no use asking.

280
00:17:45,705 --> 00:17:48,708
So I had this ad made up
all on my own...

281
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:52,295
because I thought, well,
what's the harm in trying?

282
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:54,756
There was always a chance
that you might, Mr. Lydecker.

283
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:56,758
Just think what
it would mean...

284
00:17:56,883 --> 00:18:01,096
You seem to be completely disregarding
something more important than your career.

285
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:03,849
- What?
- My lunch.

286
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:08,437
Do you really believe that?

287
00:18:08,562 --> 00:18:11,022
Implicitly.

288
00:18:11,148 --> 00:18:13,608
I never heard
of anything so selfish.

289
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:18,363
In my case, self-absorption
is completely justified.

290
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:21,908
I have never discovered any other
subject quite so worthy of my attention.

291
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:24,578
But you write about people...

292
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,998
with such real understanding
and sentiment.

293
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,585
That's what makes
your column so good.

294
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,088
Sentiment comes easily
at 50 cents a word.

295
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,800
Well, if that's the way
you really feel...

296
00:18:39,926 --> 00:18:42,929
you must be very lonely.

297
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:46,975
Will you kindly continue
this character analysis elsewhere?

298
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,353
- You begin to bore me.
- You're a poor man.

299
00:18:50,437 --> 00:18:52,564
I'm very sorry for you.

300
00:18:55,275 --> 00:18:57,986
Naturally,
I was annoyed by the incident...

301
00:18:59,196 --> 00:19:01,531
but she had something
about her, that girl.

302
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:06,828
I had to speak to her again.
I had to see her.

303
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:09,289
- Miss, would you mind if I...
- Just a moment, please.

304
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:11,708
I'll tell Mr. Bullitt right away.
He's on the telephone.

305
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:14,127
Thank you.

306
00:19:34,815 --> 00:19:38,151
Boy, Waldo Lydecker
to see Miss Laura Hunt.

307
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,073
Announce me.

308
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:45,492
Johnny, please tell
the gentleman I'm busy.

309
00:19:50,414 --> 00:19:54,126
Miss Hunt, I have something
to say to you.

310
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:56,670
You've already said it,
Mr. Lydecker.

311
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:00,424
I wish to point out that you caught me
at my most difficult moment.

312
00:20:00,507 --> 00:20:03,260
Ordinarily I am not
without a heart.

313
00:20:03,343 --> 00:20:05,262
Really?

314
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:07,848
Shall I produce
X-ray pictures to prove it?

315
00:20:11,184 --> 00:20:13,520
I wish to apologize.

316
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:15,564
Your apology is accepted.

317
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,860
Good-bye, Mr. Lydecker.

318
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,195
If you come
a little bit closer, my boy...

319
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,823
I can just crack your skull
with my stick.

320
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,122
And now, for reasons
which are too embarrassing to mention...

321
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:35,208
I'd like to endorse that pen.

322
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:38,253
Mr. Lydecker!

323
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:40,338
Thank you.

324
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:45,969
- You're a very strange man.
- What?

325
00:20:46,052 --> 00:20:50,098
You're really sorry
for the way you acted, aren't you?

326
00:20:50,223 --> 00:20:52,684
Let's not be psychiatric,
Miss Hunt...

327
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:55,687
but in a word, yes.

328
00:20:57,063 --> 00:20:58,982
It's very kind of you,
you know.

329
00:20:59,065 --> 00:21:02,694
I'm not kind. I'm vicious.
It's the secret of my charm.

330
00:21:05,322 --> 00:21:07,532
But if you choose
to think me kind...

331
00:21:08,575 --> 00:21:11,036
I'll call for you at 6:00.

332
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:14,831
All right?

333
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:17,000
All right.

334
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:23,215
Her career began
with my endorsement of the pen.

335
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:26,468
I secured other endorsements for her...

336
00:21:26,593 --> 00:21:28,595
introduced her
to important clients.

337
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,516
I gave her her start...

338
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:34,559
but it was her own talent
and imagination...

339
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:37,521
that enabled her to rise
to the top of her profession...

340
00:21:37,604 --> 00:21:39,564
and stay there.

341
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,027
She had an eager mind always.

342
00:21:44,111 --> 00:21:47,781
She was always quick to seize upon
anything that would improve her mind...

343
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,866
or her appearance.

344
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:53,203
Laura had innate breeding.

345
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,752
But she deferred
to my judgment and taste.

346
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:04,673
I selected a more attractive
hairdress for her.

347
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:11,096
I taught her what clothes
were more becoming to her.

348
00:22:13,306 --> 00:22:16,101
Through me, she met everyone.

349
00:22:16,226 --> 00:22:18,895
The famous and the infamous.

350
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:23,316
Her youth and beauty, her poise
and charm of manner...

351
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,569
captivated them all.

352
00:22:25,694 --> 00:22:28,238
She had warmth, vitality.

353
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,658
She had authentic magnetism.

354
00:22:33,201 --> 00:22:36,496
Wherever we went,
she stood out.

355
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:40,500
Men admired her.
Women envied her.

356
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:44,713
She became as well known
as Waldo Lydecker's walking stick...

357
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,048
and his white carnation.

358
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:50,385
But Tuesday and Friday nights
we stayed home...

359
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:53,847
dining quietly,
listening to my records.

360
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,809
I read my articles to her.

361
00:22:57,934 --> 00:23:00,937
The way she listened
was more eloquent than speech.

362
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,149
These were the best nights.

363
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:10,197
Then one Tuesday, she phoned
and said she couldn't come.

364
00:23:11,531 --> 00:23:14,034
It didn't matter, really.

365
00:23:14,117 --> 00:23:17,537
But when it happened again
the following Friday, I was disturbed.

366
00:23:19,956 --> 00:23:23,502
I couldn't
understand it. I felt betrayed...

367
00:23:24,795 --> 00:23:27,422
and yet I knew Laura
would never betray anyone.

368
00:23:34,304 --> 00:23:36,264
I walked for a long time.

369
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:41,978
Then I found myself
before her apartment building.

370
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:46,775
The lights were on.
It pleased me to know she was home...

371
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,860
till I saw she was not alone.

372
00:23:51,154 --> 00:23:55,367
But I waited.
I wanted to see who he was.

373
00:24:00,288 --> 00:24:03,250
It was Jacoby, who had recently
painted her portrait.

374
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:06,169
I never liked the man.

375
00:24:06,294 --> 00:24:11,425
He was so obviously conscious of looking
more like an athlete than an artist.

376
00:24:11,508 --> 00:24:14,594
I sat up the rest of the night
writing a column about him.

377
00:24:14,678 --> 00:24:16,596
I demolished his affectations...

378
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,016
exposed his camouflaged
imitations of better painters...

379
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:22,811
ridiculed his theories.

380
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:26,189
I did it for her,
knowing Jacoby was unworthy of her.

381
00:24:26,314 --> 00:24:30,152
It was a masterpiece
because it was a labor of love.

382
00:24:30,277 --> 00:24:33,447
Naturally, she could never
regard him seriously again.

383
00:24:34,865 --> 00:24:37,868
There were others,
of course...

384
00:24:37,951 --> 00:24:39,953
but her own discrimination
ruled them out...

385
00:24:40,036 --> 00:24:42,748
before it became necessary
for me to intercede...

386
00:24:44,374 --> 00:24:47,711
until one night at a party
at Ann Treadwell's.

387
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:51,715
It was one of her usual roundups
of bizarre and nondescript characters...

388
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:54,342
- corralled from every stratum of society.
- How are you this evening?

389
00:24:54,468 --> 00:24:56,887
This is Mr. And Mrs. Preston.
They've been waiting to meet you.

390
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,889
How do you do?

391
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:03,935
- Hello, Shelby.
- Excuse me, honey.

392
00:25:08,482 --> 00:25:10,650
You're Laura Hunt.

393
00:25:10,734 --> 00:25:14,279
- Yes?
- Hello. I'm Shelby Carpenter.

394
00:25:14,404 --> 00:25:17,657
- Want to dance?
- I'm not alone.

395
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:22,287
Oh, him? I'll bet
he's still doing the polka.

396
00:25:22,412 --> 00:25:25,040
Excuse me, please. Yes.

397
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:27,042
Betsy Ross taught it to me.

398
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,127
- Hello, Waldo. Darling, how are you?
- Hello, darling.

399
00:25:29,252 --> 00:25:31,129
- I see you've met Shelby.
- Hello, Ann.

400
00:25:31,254 --> 00:25:33,924
- Unavoidably.
- He was awfully nice to me in Louisville at the Derby.

401
00:25:34,049 --> 00:25:36,343
His family's from Kentucky.

402
00:25:36,426 --> 00:25:38,428
Sharecroppers, no doubt.

403
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:46,520
Louise. Louise, for the last time,
will you marry me?

404
00:25:46,603 --> 00:25:48,980
I won't, but I've saved
some chicken livers for you.

405
00:25:49,106 --> 00:25:50,982
Oh, you're an angel.
In the meantime, darling...

406
00:25:51,108 --> 00:25:53,360
you think you could
get this spot out for me?

407
00:25:53,443 --> 00:25:56,113
I can afford a blemish on my character
but not on my clothes.

408
00:25:56,238 --> 00:25:58,949
- Mmm. Couldn't eat another mouthful.
- I'm afraid it's rouge.

409
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:01,034
- I'm afraid it's liquor.
- Louise. Oh.

410
00:26:01,118 --> 00:26:04,121
- May I have a glass of milk for Mr. Lydecker?
- Of course, Miss Hunt.

411
00:26:04,204 --> 00:26:06,248
I forgot to tell you.
I also read palms.

412
00:26:06,373 --> 00:26:10,293
I cook, I swallow swords, I mend my own
socks, I never eat garlic or onions.

413
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:12,295
What more can you want
of a man?

414
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:15,298
- Don't listen to that scalawag.
- I didn't expect to find him here, Louise.

415
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,300
What do you mean?
We're old friends.

416
00:26:17,426 --> 00:26:19,302
She feeds me,
humors me, repairs me...

417
00:26:19,428 --> 00:26:21,430
and refuses to marry me,
don't you, honey?

418
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:23,473
- I do.
- She has good sense.

419
00:26:23,557 --> 00:26:26,268
- Now, wait just a minute. Thanks, Louise.
- You're wasting your time.

420
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,937
- She's got good sense too.
- You're jealous.

421
00:26:30,772 --> 00:26:33,608
And what does it feel like,
Mr. Carpenter?

422
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,361
What does what feel like,
Miss Hunt?

423
00:26:36,486 --> 00:26:38,780
Living on the income
from an estate.

424
00:26:38,905 --> 00:26:40,782
- Well, I, uh-
- Or don't you know?

425
00:26:40,907 --> 00:26:45,412
Well, I did, until the sheriff
took it over 10 years ago.

426
00:26:45,495 --> 00:26:47,414
Why maintain the fiction?
Why not work?

427
00:26:47,497 --> 00:26:50,792
Believe it or not, I asked
one of my many friends for a job once...

428
00:26:50,917 --> 00:26:53,420
executive of a big company...
2,500 employees.

429
00:26:53,503 --> 00:26:56,423
He could have pressed a button
and done it, but he just laughed.

430
00:26:56,506 --> 00:26:58,425
- He thought I was joking.
- Weren't you?

431
00:26:58,508 --> 00:27:01,511
No. When I convinced him, he got
embarrassed, said he'd phone me.

432
00:27:01,595 --> 00:27:06,600
That was months ago. Now whenever
he sees me, he looks the other way.

433
00:27:13,774 --> 00:27:16,777
- Do you really want a job?
- Yes.

434
00:27:19,613 --> 00:27:21,615
Oh, here you are.

435
00:27:21,698 --> 00:27:25,410
Laura, dear, I cannot stand
these morons any longer.

436
00:27:25,535 --> 00:27:29,331
If you don't come with me
this instant, I shall run amok.

437
00:27:29,456 --> 00:27:31,374
All right, Waldo.

438
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,586
10:30 tomorrow,
Bullitt and Company.

439
00:27:35,629 --> 00:27:37,881
You've got a job.

440
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:41,593
I concealed my
annoyance with masterly self-control...

441
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:46,640
but I sensed a situation
which would bear watching.

442
00:27:46,723 --> 00:27:50,685
Laura, take a look at this.

443
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:54,231
Do you like it? Do you think it'll make
people want to bathe more often?

444
00:27:54,314 --> 00:27:56,858
It should. It's excellent.

445
00:27:56,983 --> 00:27:58,902
- There you are.
- Good night, Miss Hunt.

446
00:27:59,027 --> 00:28:00,904
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Carpenter.

447
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:03,490
- Good night, honey.
- It's really very good. Who's the model?

448
00:28:03,573 --> 00:28:06,451
A girl named Diane Redfern.
You hired her yourself last week.

449
00:28:06,576 --> 00:28:08,453
- Don't you remember?
- Oh, yeah.

450
00:28:08,578 --> 00:28:11,540
Well, let's go, moon of my delight.
I am starved.

451
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,000
You usually are.

452
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:16,002
- I approve of that hat.
- You do?

453
00:28:16,086 --> 00:28:18,797
Mm-hmm.
And the girl in it too.

454
00:28:18,922 --> 00:28:20,882
Thank you.

455
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:25,846
I knew there was
something on my mind.

456
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:29,307
What is it? Oh, yes.
Will you dine with me tomorrow night?

457
00:28:29,433 --> 00:28:31,852
- Maybe.
- No, that isn't what's worrying me.

458
00:28:31,935 --> 00:28:34,062
- It's the next night.
- But, Shelby, I can't be...

459
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:37,190
Good. What about three weeks from
tonight and all the nights in between?

460
00:28:37,274 --> 00:28:39,192
Don't you think
I have any other engagements?

461
00:28:39,276 --> 00:28:42,487
What about two months
from now and the month after that?

462
00:28:42,612 --> 00:28:45,782
- What about next year?
- That's all settled. What about breakfast?

463
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:48,869
What about dancing?

464
00:28:48,952 --> 00:28:50,871
What about lunch?
Beautiful lunches...

465
00:28:50,954 --> 00:28:53,749
- day after day after day after day?
- What about work?

466
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,668
Beautiful work,
day after day after day?

467
00:28:56,793 --> 00:28:58,712
Why, Miss Hunt,
the way you talk.

468
00:28:58,795 --> 00:29:00,839
You'd think I was
in love with you.

469
00:29:06,636 --> 00:29:08,847
Yes, Laura,
I heard everything he said.

470
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,478
I went to call for you.

471
00:29:15,896 --> 00:29:17,898
I'm sorry, Waldo.

472
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:19,983
And that reminds me.

473
00:29:22,402 --> 00:29:25,072
Old Mother Hubbard has
something in the cupboard.

474
00:29:27,657 --> 00:29:29,618
The results of
my private investigation...

475
00:29:29,743 --> 00:29:32,162
of that sterling character,
Mr. Shelby Carpenter.

476
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:36,750
By stooping so low, you only
degrade yourself, Waldo.

477
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:41,963
Did you know that he almost went to jail
for passing rubber checks...

478
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:44,341
that he was suspected of stealing
his hostess's jewels...

479
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:46,635
when he was a houseguest
in Virginia?

480
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,304
Naturally they'd suspect him,
because he isn't rich.

481
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,641
Those are only insinuations...

482
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,851
the cheapest kind.

483
00:29:54,976 --> 00:29:57,562
These aren't only
insinuations, my dear.

484
00:29:57,687 --> 00:29:59,648
There you are.
Read them.

485
00:30:01,608 --> 00:30:03,652
What of it?

486
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:07,739
I know his faults.
A man can change, can't he?

487
00:30:07,864 --> 00:30:10,534
People are always ready
to hold out a hand to slap you down...

488
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:12,536
but never to pick you up.

489
00:30:12,661 --> 00:30:14,996
All right,
I'm helping Shelby.

490
00:30:15,122 --> 00:30:17,207
His past is his own affair.

491
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:20,210
I only care about the present.

492
00:30:20,335 --> 00:30:23,505
Speaking of the changed Mr. Carpenter
in the present tense...

493
00:30:25,048 --> 00:30:27,801
he's now running around
with a model from your own office.

494
00:30:27,884 --> 00:30:30,095
Her name is Diane Redfern.

495
00:30:32,347 --> 00:30:35,642
I'm closer to despising you
than I thought I ever would be.

496
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:46,069
I'm sorry. I should have
told you before.

497
00:30:46,194 --> 00:30:48,739
Shelby and I are going to be
married next week.

498
00:30:52,993 --> 00:30:56,371
I believe you presented him with
a cigarette case on his last birthday.

499
00:30:59,916 --> 00:31:01,793
Rather valuable, isn't it?

500
00:31:01,918 --> 00:31:03,920
Where did you get it?

501
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:07,340
From the pawnshop where Diane Redfern
took it after he gave it to her.

502
00:31:07,424 --> 00:31:10,802
I don't believe it. He probably needed
money and was too proud to borrow.

503
00:31:10,927 --> 00:31:12,888
Carpenter proud?

504
00:31:14,264 --> 00:31:16,767
Perhaps that's why
the pawn ticket was in her name.

505
00:31:16,892 --> 00:31:18,935
Before this goes any further,
why, I'll just...

506
00:31:21,229 --> 00:31:23,190
He isn't home.

507
00:31:30,781 --> 00:31:32,657
He's dining
at Ann Treadwell's.

508
00:31:32,783 --> 00:31:34,868
He can't be.
He asked me to dinner.

509
00:31:34,951 --> 00:31:38,705
He would have canceled his appointment
with her if you had accepted.

510
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:41,416
He treats her
rather badly these days.

511
00:31:43,543 --> 00:31:45,754
I'm afraid she'll say
he isn't there.

512
00:31:55,138 --> 00:31:57,099
Waldo...

513
00:31:58,225 --> 00:32:00,185
why are you doing this?

514
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:07,484
For you, Laura.

515
00:32:09,402 --> 00:32:12,280
Shall we pay them a visit?

516
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:15,867
He won't be there, Waldo.
I know he won't.

517
00:32:15,992 --> 00:32:18,161
All right. We'll see.

518
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:24,251
Don't you want to take this little
bauble along in case he is there?

519
00:32:32,342 --> 00:32:34,219
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

520
00:32:34,344 --> 00:32:37,139
- I'm sorry. Mrs. Treadwell is not home.
- We know, dear.

521
00:32:50,026 --> 00:32:51,987
Good evening.

522
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:59,911
Hello, darling. I didn't expect
to see you tonight.

523
00:33:00,036 --> 00:33:01,913
There you are, my dear.

524
00:33:02,038 --> 00:33:04,666
In a moment of supreme disaster,
he's trite.

525
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,544
You've been reading
too many melodramas, Waldo.

526
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:10,756
I was just telling Ann
about our getting married.

527
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:12,758
Well, have you two
had dinner?

528
00:33:13,884 --> 00:33:15,844
Would you like
a glass of wine?

529
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,054
Why don't you sit down?

530
00:33:26,563 --> 00:33:30,400
I couldn't find out
if she saw Carpenter in the meantime.

531
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:33,987
All I know is that on Friday
she had lunch with Diane Redfern.

532
00:33:35,655 --> 00:33:38,492
What came of it,
I hoped to hear that night.

533
00:33:38,575 --> 00:33:42,120
- I alternated between moods of
over optimism and over pessimism.

534
00:33:42,245 --> 00:33:44,956
When the phone rang,
I had a foreboding of disaster.

535
00:33:49,002 --> 00:33:51,963
I called to tell you, Waldo,
I'm frightfully sorry.

536
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:54,424
I can't have dinner
with you tonight.

537
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:58,136
Oh, no, no. I'm not sick.
I'm just dreadfully nervous.

538
00:33:58,261 --> 00:34:00,806
I'm going to the country
for a few days.

539
00:34:00,931 --> 00:34:02,808
Yes. I'm afraid
it's about Shelby.

540
00:34:04,017 --> 00:34:06,228
Oh, no. Please.
There's nothing you can do.

541
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:08,772
I've got to think
this thing out for myself.

542
00:34:08,897 --> 00:34:12,901
I'm sorry. I'll call you
when I get back. Good-bye.

543
00:34:14,694 --> 00:34:17,280
It was the last time
I ever heard her voice.

544
00:34:18,615 --> 00:34:21,618
I was sure she had
too much pride to forgive him.

545
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,288
But...

546
00:34:25,414 --> 00:34:28,417
Where does
this Diane Redfern live?

547
00:34:28,542 --> 00:34:30,919
Brooklyn somewhere.
She's in the phone book.

548
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,090
Come on. It's late.
Let's get going.

549
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,135
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir.

550
00:34:41,388 --> 00:34:43,390
- All right.
- Thank you, Mr. Lydecker.

551
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,980
Good night.

552
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:56,737
I shall never forgive myself for
letting her become involved with Shelby.

553
00:34:57,988 --> 00:35:00,449
It was my fault.

554
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:03,118
I should have
stopped it somehow.

555
00:35:03,243 --> 00:35:05,203
Well, it's too late now.

556
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:11,126
Thanks for the wine.

557
00:35:28,518 --> 00:35:30,645
Hello. Mosconi's?

558
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:33,982
This is Lieutenant McPherson,
Homicide Bureau.

559
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:38,111
Laura Hunt had been buying her liquor
from you for several years, hadn't she?

560
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,447
Yeah.

561
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,784
Did she ever buy a brand of scotch
called Black Pony?

562
00:35:45,452 --> 00:35:47,329
Yeah.

563
00:35:48,371 --> 00:35:51,083
I see.

564
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:53,293
Well, that's all
I wanted to know. Thanks.

565
00:35:53,376 --> 00:35:55,295
She's here, McPherson...
the maid.

566
00:35:55,378 --> 00:35:57,839
Okay.

567
00:35:57,923 --> 00:36:00,675
- Come in, Miss Clary.
- Never mind the "Miss Clary" stuff.

568
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:04,596
My name's Bessie, and I'm a domestic,
and I got nothin' to be ashamed of.

569
00:36:04,721 --> 00:36:06,723
Sit down, Bessie.

570
00:36:07,891 --> 00:36:09,976
Her letters.

571
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,978
And her private diary.

572
00:36:13,188 --> 00:36:15,148
You've been reading them,
pawing over them.

573
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:18,693
It's a shame in the face of the dead.
That's what it is. It's a shame.

574
00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:21,405
- Sit down, Bessie.
- I'll stand on my own two feet.

575
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,532
Don't you go
ordering me around.

576
00:36:23,657 --> 00:36:28,161
I ain't afraid of cops. I was
brought up to spit whenever I saw one.

577
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:32,082
Okay, go ahead and spit
if that'll make you feel better.

578
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:40,132
What do you want to know?

579
00:36:40,257 --> 00:36:42,551
What we all want to know...
who killed Laura Hunt.

580
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:44,594
How would I know?

581
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:48,473
You don't think I done it?

582
00:36:48,598 --> 00:36:51,226
I know you cops
get crazy notions...

583
00:36:51,351 --> 00:36:53,687
but if you got any notion
concerning me...

584
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:57,232
Ask anyone...
anyone who ever come to this house.

585
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,234
I would have
worked for her.

586
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:01,236
I would have washed,
ironed, scrubbed...

587
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:05,031
done everything she wanted of me,
whether she paid me for it or not.

588
00:37:05,115 --> 00:37:09,077
And it wasn't only on account of the
thousand sweet things she done for me.

589
00:37:09,202 --> 00:37:11,705
It was because she was
so sweet herself...

590
00:37:11,788 --> 00:37:15,375
because she was
a real fine lady.

591
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,255
But you cops
wouldn't know about that.

592
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:25,635
But you do. That's all the more reason
why you should help me, Bessie.

593
00:37:25,761 --> 00:37:28,722
Do you happen to know how this got into
her liquor cabinet?

594
00:37:30,307 --> 00:37:32,309
I put it there.

595
00:37:32,434 --> 00:37:35,896
But she never bought cheap stuff like
that... not a lady like Miss Hunt.

596
00:37:35,979 --> 00:37:38,982
- No.
- When did you put it in the cabinet?

597
00:37:39,065 --> 00:37:40,942
- Saturday.
- Before the police came.

598
00:37:41,068 --> 00:37:44,529
- Was it there Friday night before you left?
- No.

599
00:37:44,654 --> 00:37:46,698
Are you sure of that?

600
00:37:46,823 --> 00:37:49,409
I cleaned out
the cabinet on Friday...

601
00:37:49,493 --> 00:37:51,495
and put the empties
in the basement.

602
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:55,207
Then somebody was with her
in the apartment Friday night...

603
00:37:55,332 --> 00:37:57,209
someone
who brought that bottle.

604
00:37:57,334 --> 00:37:59,252
- Yes.
- Who?

605
00:37:59,336 --> 00:38:01,630
I don't know,
but I didn't want anyone...

606
00:38:01,755 --> 00:38:05,008
getting any wrong ideas about her,
God rest her soul.

607
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:08,095
That's why I took it out of the bedroom
and put it in the cabinet...

608
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,138
before the police got here.

609
00:38:10,222 --> 00:38:12,724
And that ain't all I done.

610
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:15,894
I washed out the glasses
and cleaned off the bottle too.

611
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:18,355
Do you know what happens to people
who destroy evidence?

612
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,316
I don't care.

613
00:38:21,441 --> 00:38:23,652
You ain't gonna tell
the newspaper reporters, are ya...

614
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,779
and let them make up
their nasty stories...

615
00:38:25,862 --> 00:38:27,864
and drag her name
through the mud?

616
00:38:29,157 --> 00:38:31,535
Go ahead,
but it won't do you any good.

617
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,496
- I'll say you lied. I'll say...
- Take it easy, Bessie.

618
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:37,791
Get me some ice
and a setup, will you?

619
00:38:37,874 --> 00:38:40,127
All right.

620
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,254
A couple of highball glasses.

621
00:38:46,883 --> 00:38:48,802
Good morning.
Lieutenant McPherson sent for us.

622
00:38:48,885 --> 00:38:50,804
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Hello, McPherson.

623
00:38:50,887 --> 00:38:53,723
- This is quite a delegation. I only sent for you, Carpenter.
- I know.

624
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:56,101
Shelby's dropping me off
at the hairdresser's later...

625
00:38:56,226 --> 00:38:59,479
- so I thought I might as well come along.
- My excuse is equally feeble.

626
00:38:59,563 --> 00:39:01,690
I just popped in
to pay my dubious respects...

627
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:03,733
and inquire as to
the state of your health.

628
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:06,403
- Insipid, I trust.
- I was just going to pour myself a drink.

629
00:39:06,528 --> 00:39:09,990
- Care to join me?
- A very nice idea. Shelby, wouldn't you like one?

630
00:39:10,073 --> 00:39:11,992
- I'll get it.
- Never mind.

631
00:39:12,075 --> 00:39:14,244
- Bessie, would you bring a couple more glasses?
- Yes, sir.

632
00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:16,538
Hi, Bessie.
What are you doing here?

633
00:39:16,663 --> 00:39:18,832
I'm paid up for the week,
and I'm working, regardless.

634
00:39:18,915 --> 00:39:21,626
- Would you like one, Lydecker?
- I see no reason to exclude myself...

635
00:39:21,752 --> 00:39:23,628
if the host provides scotch.

636
00:39:23,754 --> 00:39:26,047
- This do?
- I presume it'll have to.

637
00:39:26,173 --> 00:39:28,341
How about you, Carpenter?
It's cheap, but it's potent.

638
00:39:28,425 --> 00:39:32,429
As a matter of fact, I don't think I care
for any. I'm not much of a daytime drinker.

639
00:39:32,554 --> 00:39:36,767
- Uh-huh. That'll be all for you, Bessie.
You can go home now. - But I... Yes, sir.

640
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:40,395
I remember when Laura
bought these glasses.

641
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,731
She loved them.
She loved all her things so.

642
00:39:42,856 --> 00:39:45,233
What are you going to do?
Sell them?

643
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:48,236
I don't know.
I suppose so. Thank you.

644
00:39:48,361 --> 00:39:52,365
If I'm appointed administrator of the estate,
I shall probably just call in Corey.

645
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:54,576
You mean Lancaster Corey,
the art dealer?

646
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,578
Yes. He was
a friend of Laura's.

647
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:59,998
Let him dispose of everything.
It'll be less gruesome that way.

648
00:40:00,123 --> 00:40:03,126
Not quite everything, Ann.

649
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:05,545
Two or three things in here
belong to me.

650
00:40:05,629 --> 00:40:07,756
This vase, for instance...

651
00:40:08,882 --> 00:40:10,801
and that, uh, clock,
of course...

652
00:40:10,926 --> 00:40:13,804
and the antique fire screen.

653
00:40:13,929 --> 00:40:16,431
- I only lent them to Laura, you know.
- Oh, really, Waldo.

654
00:40:16,556 --> 00:40:20,185
Yes, really. This vase is the gem of my
collection. I intend to have it back.

655
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,229
And the clock and the screen too.

656
00:40:22,312 --> 00:40:25,273
But they aren't yours. You gave them
to Laura. I won't permit it.

657
00:40:25,357 --> 00:40:28,693
Does an alleged fiance
have any voice in this matter?

658
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:33,740
I'll take the vase with me now and send someone
to collect the other things this very day.

659
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:37,452
Nothing is leaving here
except you, Lydecker.

660
00:40:37,577 --> 00:40:40,747
Is that your quaint way
of indicating dismissal?

661
00:40:40,831 --> 00:40:43,834
We're all going anyway. I have to be
back at headquarters by noon.

662
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:47,796
Lieutenant, I don't understand.
You sent for me, didn't you?

663
00:40:47,921 --> 00:40:49,881
- Yeah.
- Well, don't you want to see me?

664
00:40:50,006 --> 00:40:52,634
- Don't you want to ask me some questions?
- I'll be seeing you.

665
00:40:52,759 --> 00:40:54,928
- Well...
- I bid you good day.

666
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:58,765
- Come along, Shelby.
- Are you making any progress on the case, Lieutenant?

667
00:41:00,392 --> 00:41:02,352
We're doing all right.

668
00:41:16,701 --> 00:41:19,496
- Hello, Mark.
- Go get something to eat. I'll take over.

669
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:21,748
- Thanks.
- Take your time.

670
00:44:21,261 --> 00:44:23,513
Fred?

671
00:44:27,767 --> 00:44:30,103
- Yes?
- What's the matter? Did you go to sleep?

672
00:44:30,228 --> 00:44:33,023
This is McPherson.
Any calls come through?

673
00:44:34,774 --> 00:44:36,735
Well, keep listening.

674
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,904
No. Nothing new.

675
00:44:45,118 --> 00:44:47,245
I happened to see
the lights on.

676
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,457
Have you sublet
this apartment?

677
00:44:50,582 --> 00:44:52,500
You're here often enough
to pay rent.

678
00:44:52,584 --> 00:44:55,879
- Any objections?
- Yes.

679
00:44:56,004 --> 00:44:57,964
I object to you prying
into Laura's letters...

680
00:44:58,089 --> 00:44:59,966
especially those from me.

681
00:45:00,091 --> 00:45:03,053
- Why? Yours are the best in the bunch.
- Thanks.

682
00:45:03,136 --> 00:45:05,388
But I didn't
write them to you.

683
00:45:05,513 --> 00:45:07,891
Haven't you any sense
of privacy?

684
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,228
Murder victims have
no claim to privacy.

685
00:45:12,354 --> 00:45:16,149
Have detectives who buy portraits
of murder victims a claim to privacy?

686
00:45:17,901 --> 00:45:21,154
Lancaster Corey told me
that you've already put in a bid for it.

687
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,698
That's none of your business.

688
00:45:23,782 --> 00:45:27,786
McPherson, did it ever strike you
that you're acting very strangely?

689
00:45:27,911 --> 00:45:31,414
It's a wonder you don't come here like a
suitor, with roses and a box of candy...

690
00:45:31,539 --> 00:45:33,500
drugstore candy, of course.

691
00:45:34,709 --> 00:45:37,128
Have you ever dreamed
of Laura as your wife...

692
00:45:37,254 --> 00:45:40,298
by your side at the policeman's ball,
or in the bleachers...

693
00:45:40,423 --> 00:45:43,551
or listening to the heroic story of how
you got a silver shinbone...

694
00:45:43,635 --> 00:45:45,887
from a gun battle
with a gangster?

695
00:45:47,597 --> 00:45:51,184
- I see you have.
- Why don't you go home? I'm busy.

696
00:45:52,394 --> 00:45:54,354
Perhaps we can
come to terms now.

697
00:45:55,689 --> 00:45:58,858
You want the portrait.
Perfectly understandable.

698
00:45:58,984 --> 00:46:02,320
I want my possessions...
my vase, my clock and my screen.

699
00:46:02,445 --> 00:46:04,739
Also perfectly understandable.
Now, if you...

700
00:46:04,823 --> 00:46:06,741
Get going.

701
00:46:06,825 --> 00:46:11,413
You better watch out, McPherson,
or you'll end up in a psychiatric ward.

702
00:46:11,496 --> 00:46:15,667
I don't think they've ever had a patient
who fell in love with a corpse.

703
00:47:45,924 --> 00:47:47,884
What are you doing here?

704
00:47:50,178 --> 00:47:52,055
You're alive.

705
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:55,475
If you don't get out at once,
I'm going to call the police.

706
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,978
You are Laura Hunt,
aren't you?

707
00:47:59,729 --> 00:48:01,606
Aren't you?

708
00:48:01,731 --> 00:48:04,317
- I'm going to call the police.
- Well, I am the police.

709
00:48:06,152 --> 00:48:08,405
Mark McPherson.

710
00:48:09,614 --> 00:48:11,616
What's this all about?

711
00:48:11,741 --> 00:48:13,952
Don't you know?

712
00:48:14,077 --> 00:48:17,706
- Don't you know what's happened?
- No.

713
00:48:17,789 --> 00:48:20,458
Haven't you seen the papers?
Where have you been?

714
00:48:20,584 --> 00:48:24,754
Up in the country.
I-I don't get a newspaper.

715
00:48:24,879 --> 00:48:28,883
- Haven't you got a radio?
- It was broken.

716
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:30,927
What...

717
00:48:49,029 --> 00:48:51,698
Somebody was murdered
in this room.

718
00:48:51,823 --> 00:48:53,700
Do you have any idea
who it was?

719
00:48:53,825 --> 00:48:55,702
No.

720
00:48:55,827 --> 00:48:58,330
Who had a key
to your apartment?

721
00:48:58,455 --> 00:49:00,457
Nobody.

722
00:49:00,582 --> 00:49:02,459
Are you sure?

723
00:49:03,501 --> 00:49:07,297
- When did it happen?
- Friday night.

724
00:49:10,216 --> 00:49:12,260
What are you
going to do now?

725
00:49:12,344 --> 00:49:14,471
Find out
who was murdered...

726
00:49:14,554 --> 00:49:17,557
and then find the murderer.

727
00:49:20,185 --> 00:49:23,647
You'd better take off those wet clothes.
You might catch cold.

728
00:49:28,109 --> 00:49:29,986
Yeah.

729
00:49:39,621 --> 00:49:41,498
I found this in my closet.

730
00:49:41,623 --> 00:49:43,541
It's Diane Redfern's.

731
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:46,836
It wasn't here when I left.
She's one of our models.

732
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,172
Just about my size.

733
00:49:49,297 --> 00:49:52,175
Beautiful, wasn't she?

734
00:49:52,259 --> 00:49:54,386
Do you suppose...

735
00:49:58,807 --> 00:50:00,767
Sit down, please.

736
00:50:04,896 --> 00:50:07,816
This is Monday night.
You left on Friday.

737
00:50:07,899 --> 00:50:11,653
- Rather a long weekend, isn't it?
- Yes.

738
00:50:11,736 --> 00:50:13,738
What train did you take?

739
00:50:13,863 --> 00:50:15,740
The 7:26.

740
00:50:15,865 --> 00:50:18,994
- See anybody you knew on the train?
- No.

741
00:50:19,077 --> 00:50:23,290
- Then what?
- Then I got off the train at Norwalk.

742
00:50:23,415 --> 00:50:26,835
- Saw nobody you knew at the station either?
- No.

743
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,172
- Go on.
- Then I went to the garage where I keep my car.

744
00:50:31,256 --> 00:50:35,176
It's a private garage.
Nobody saw me there either.

745
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,220
Then I drove to my house.

746
00:50:37,345 --> 00:50:40,098
You were there three days.
What did you do?

747
00:50:40,223 --> 00:50:42,851
Work in my garden.

748
00:50:42,934 --> 00:50:44,894
You didn't go out
in all that time?

749
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:48,732
No. I had everything
I needed in the house.

750
00:50:48,815 --> 00:50:51,067
- Nobody came to see you?
- Nobody.

751
00:50:51,151 --> 00:50:53,069
I went there to be alone.

752
00:50:53,153 --> 00:50:56,489
Police were there on Saturday.
There was no one in the house.

753
00:50:57,616 --> 00:51:01,202
Oh, yes. Saturday,
I took a long walk.

754
00:51:01,286 --> 00:51:03,371
I walked for hours
in the woods.

755
00:51:03,496 --> 00:51:08,501
Mm-hmm. You were going to
marry Shelby Carpenter this week.

756
00:51:08,627 --> 00:51:10,503
Thursday, if I'm not mistaken.

757
00:51:12,005 --> 00:51:13,924
Yes.

758
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:16,968
Yet you went away
just before your wedding...

759
00:51:17,093 --> 00:51:20,180
for a long weekend
to be alone.

760
00:51:20,305 --> 00:51:22,766
I was tired.
I'd been working hard.

761
00:51:22,849 --> 00:51:26,061
You know Shelby Carpenter has a key to
this apartment. Why didn't you tell me?

762
00:51:26,144 --> 00:51:28,521
I know nothing of the sort.
He hasn't.

763
00:51:28,647 --> 00:51:30,607
How else did the girl
get into the apartment?

764
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:33,735
You knew she was in love with Carpenter,
that he'd given her your cigarette case.

765
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,820
You know all that,
don't you?

766
00:51:35,946 --> 00:51:38,698
I knew that she was in love with him.
She told me so herself.

767
00:51:38,823 --> 00:51:41,952
- When did she tell you?
- At lunch last Friday.

768
00:51:42,077 --> 00:51:45,789
I also know she meant nothing to Shelby.
I understand him better than you do.

769
00:51:45,914 --> 00:51:48,166
She was found in your
dressing gown and slippers.

770
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:50,710
That's hardly the regulation costume
for an impersonal chat...

771
00:51:50,835 --> 00:51:53,630
between a man and woman
who mean nothing to each other.

772
00:51:53,755 --> 00:51:56,508
Did you know or did you suspect he was
going to bring her here Friday night?

773
00:51:56,633 --> 00:51:59,427
How could I? I don't know that he
brought her here. Neither do you.

774
00:51:59,511 --> 00:52:01,972
- You merely assume it.
- What other assumption is possible?

775
00:52:02,055 --> 00:52:05,517
Do you love Carpenter so much you'd risk
your own safety to protect him?

776
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,395
My own safety?
Do you suspect me?

777
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,731
I suspect nobody and everybody.
I'm merely trying to get at the truth.

778
00:52:11,856 --> 00:52:14,025
I see you have been trying
to get at the truth.

779
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:16,861
You've read things I never meant
anyone else to look at.

780
00:52:16,987 --> 00:52:18,947
Strictly routine.

781
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,991
I'm sorry. Really.

782
00:52:23,785 --> 00:52:26,705
I'd better be going. I'll see you
in the morning, Miss Hunt.

783
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:30,834
Oh, I must ask you not to leave
the house or use the phone.

784
00:52:30,959 --> 00:52:34,379
But... But I've got
to let my friends know I'm alive.

785
00:52:34,504 --> 00:52:36,923
Sorry, Miss Hunt,
but I must insist you do as I say.

786
00:52:37,048 --> 00:52:40,010
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

787
00:52:40,093 --> 00:52:43,638
But if anything should happen
to you this time, I wouldn't like it.

788
00:52:44,723 --> 00:52:46,725
All right.
I promise.

789
00:52:46,808 --> 00:52:49,686
There's one more thing.
You may as well know what I know...

790
00:52:49,769 --> 00:52:51,730
some of it, at any rate.

791
00:52:51,855 --> 00:52:55,233
It'll save time and a lot
of unnecessary fencing.

792
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:58,028
I know that you went away
to make up your mind...

793
00:53:01,114 --> 00:53:04,576
whether you'd marry
Shelby Carpenter or... or not.

794
00:53:05,869 --> 00:53:08,538
What did you decide?
I want the truth.

795
00:53:10,707 --> 00:53:12,667
I decided
not to marry him.

796
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:16,671
I'll see you in the morning.
Good night.

797
00:53:16,755 --> 00:53:18,757
Good night.

798
00:53:32,604 --> 00:53:36,066
Really?
Does McPherson know that?

799
00:53:36,191 --> 00:53:38,902
Uh-huh. Well, okay.
Good-bye.

800
00:53:40,362 --> 00:53:42,822
Say, Mark, that was
the medical examiner's report.

801
00:53:42,948 --> 00:53:46,243
It wasn't Laura Hunt. It was Diane
Redfern that was bumped off upstairs.

802
00:53:46,326 --> 00:53:48,912
- Kinda balls things up, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

803
00:53:48,995 --> 00:53:51,331
Say, you're not taking it too hard.

804
00:53:51,456 --> 00:53:53,792
Wait a minute.

805
00:53:53,917 --> 00:53:56,336
- Hello?
- This is Laura. I've...

806
00:53:56,461 --> 00:53:58,421
Don't say anything on the phone.
Meet me right away.

807
00:53:58,505 --> 00:54:01,549
I'll wait for you in my car
in front of Bullitt's.

808
00:54:01,633 --> 00:54:03,677
- Was that...
- Yeah.

809
00:54:03,802 --> 00:54:06,096
Dames are always
pulling a switch on you.

810
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:08,098
Stand by.

811
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:27,450
You follow her.
I'm gonna tail him.

812
00:55:19,878 --> 00:55:22,088
Are you taking it down
or putting it away, Carpenter?

813
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:38,521
- It's been fired lately.
- Yes. I killed some rabbits with it.

814
00:55:38,605 --> 00:55:41,316
- When?
- Oh, a while back. I don't know exactly.

815
00:55:41,399 --> 00:55:43,360
You know about guns,
don't you?

816
00:55:43,485 --> 00:55:46,238
- Yes.
- How come you didn't clean it afterward?

817
00:55:46,363 --> 00:55:49,032
I don't know.
I forgot, I suppose.

818
00:55:49,115 --> 00:55:52,744
- Your initials?
- Yes. I gave it to Laura for protection.

819
00:55:52,869 --> 00:55:55,121
She didn't want it,
but I insisted.

820
00:55:55,247 --> 00:55:57,916
This house is rather isolated,
as you see.

821
00:55:58,041 --> 00:56:00,460
- Did you teach her how to use it?
- No.

822
00:56:00,585 --> 00:56:04,130
- Does she know how?
- I don't know. It didn't occur to me to ask.

823
00:56:04,256 --> 00:56:06,383
You're a vague sort of a fellow,
aren't you, Carpenter?

824
00:56:06,466 --> 00:56:10,011
I've spent very little time in observing
my own character, Mr. McPherson.

825
00:56:10,136 --> 00:56:12,764
You haven't borrowed it lately?
You didn't just bring it back tonight?

826
00:56:12,889 --> 00:56:16,935
You followed me here.
You saw me come in. You ought to know.

827
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:20,730
You, uh, realize
the spot you're in, Carpenter?

828
00:56:20,814 --> 00:56:22,774
You took that poor girl
to Miss Hunt's apartment.

829
00:56:22,899 --> 00:56:25,402
You knew all along
it was she who was murdered.

830
00:56:27,237 --> 00:56:30,574
Didn't you know Laura Hunt would come
back any day and spill the whole thing?

831
00:56:32,284 --> 00:56:34,244
Or did you plan
to kill her too...

832
00:56:34,369 --> 00:56:37,330
hide the body someplace
and cover up your first crime?

833
00:56:37,455 --> 00:56:40,875
You're being fantastic,
McPherson.

834
00:56:41,001 --> 00:56:43,628
You took a bottle of Black Pony
to her house Friday night.

835
00:56:43,753 --> 00:56:45,797
I took it there
over a week ago.

836
00:56:45,922 --> 00:56:48,425
Bessie said it wasn't there Friday
night. It was Saturday morning.

837
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:50,969
I can't help what Bessie said.

838
00:56:54,055 --> 00:56:56,975
- Where's the key to her apartment?
- I haven't got it.

839
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:01,938
- What did you do with it, give it back to her tonight?
- I never had one.

840
00:57:02,063 --> 00:57:04,482
You didn't take the bottle
of scotch to her house Friday night.

841
00:57:04,608 --> 00:57:06,943
You haven't got a key to her apartment.
How did you get in?

842
00:57:07,068 --> 00:57:09,029
- Well, I...
- You had a key, and I know it.

843
00:57:09,154 --> 00:57:11,531
- Now, come on, Carpenter. Spill it.
- I...

844
00:57:11,656 --> 00:57:16,036
Laura kept a duplicate key
at her office. I went over and got it.

845
00:57:16,161 --> 00:57:20,248
I'd asked Diane to dine with me. I wanted
to have it out with her once and for all.

846
00:57:20,332 --> 00:57:24,878
You know, she thought... Well,
she thought she was in love with me.

847
00:57:24,961 --> 00:57:28,214
Well, we couldn't go on talking
in public places. She was too upset.

848
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:30,675
I couldn't go to her room, and I didn't
want to take her to my hotel.

849
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,470
- So we went to Laura's.
- Yeah?

850
00:57:33,553 --> 00:57:35,513
We talked there
for about three hours...

851
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:39,100
- and then the doorbell rang and...
- Go on.

852
00:57:39,184 --> 00:57:41,895
Diane was frightened.
But knowing Laura as I've known her...

853
00:57:41,978 --> 00:57:43,939
I've learned to be
surprised at nothing.

854
00:57:44,022 --> 00:57:47,317
- What do you mean by that?
- Her friends would come to her with their troubles...

855
00:57:47,442 --> 00:57:49,653
at all hours
of the day or night.

856
00:57:49,736 --> 00:57:52,155
I asked Diane
to answer the door.

857
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:56,034
- Why didn't you go yourself?
- Supposing one of Laura's friends had found me there.

858
00:57:56,159 --> 00:57:58,954
- Why open the door at all?
- They must have seen the light.

859
00:57:59,037 --> 00:58:01,790
What about the girl? Diane...
what about her reputation?

860
00:58:01,873 --> 00:58:05,710
I asked her to tell them Laura had let
her the apartment while she was away.

861
00:58:05,835 --> 00:58:08,004
Anybody that knew Laura
would have believed that.

862
00:58:08,129 --> 00:58:11,466
- Yeah. Go on.
- Well, then the doorbell rang again.

863
00:58:11,549 --> 00:58:14,344
I could hear Diane's mules...
Laura's they were...

864
00:58:14,427 --> 00:58:17,389
clattering across the bare boards
between the rugs.

865
00:58:17,514 --> 00:58:19,975
Then there was a moment's silence
and then a shot.

866
00:58:21,226 --> 00:58:23,895
It was an awful explosion.

867
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:26,982
By the time I reached her,
the door was closed.

868
00:58:27,107 --> 00:58:29,651
- She lay there on the floor.
- Did you go out to see who it was?

869
00:58:29,734 --> 00:58:33,446
No. I was too confused, too horrified,
incapable of doing anything.

870
00:58:33,572 --> 00:58:36,533
The room was dark. I saw only
a vague heap lying on the floor.

871
00:58:36,616 --> 00:58:40,954
I... I don't think
I fully grasped the situation.

872
00:58:41,037 --> 00:58:44,165
I think I called her name,
but I'm not sure. I...

873
00:58:44,249 --> 00:58:47,335
I remember kneeling on the floor,
feeling her heart.

874
00:58:49,045 --> 00:58:51,006
My first instinct
was to call the police.

875
00:58:51,089 --> 00:58:53,049
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know.

876
00:58:53,174 --> 00:58:56,344
Or rather, I was afraid...
not only for myself, but for Laura.

877
00:58:56,428 --> 00:59:00,807
In a panicky sort of way, I felt I must
keep out of this to keep Laura out of it.

878
00:59:00,932 --> 00:59:03,059
I know now how foolish
and hopeless it was...

879
00:59:03,143 --> 00:59:05,687
but there was only
one thing on my mind...

880
00:59:05,812 --> 00:59:08,440
the safety of a person whose life
was dearer to me than my own.

881
00:59:08,565 --> 00:59:10,525
Don't you understand that?

882
00:59:10,609 --> 00:59:12,903
Did you think
Laura had done it?

883
00:59:12,986 --> 00:59:15,906
- Did you?
- I don't remember what I thought.

884
00:59:16,031 --> 00:59:19,034
- Do you think so now?
- No.

885
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:21,286
- But you didn't?
- No.

886
00:59:21,411 --> 00:59:24,706
On Saturday, when our men went to the
hotel to tell you that Laura was dead...

887
00:59:24,789 --> 00:59:28,710
- you seemed sincerely shocked.
- I was. I hadn't expected that mistake.

888
00:59:28,793 --> 00:59:30,837
But you had your alibi ready
no matter who was dead.

889
00:59:30,962 --> 00:59:33,757
Yet you knew the minute
Laura got back it wouldn't stick.

890
00:59:33,882 --> 00:59:36,509
Don't you see? I was incapable
of thinking that far ahead.

891
00:59:36,635 --> 00:59:39,095
I was incapable
of thinking at all.

892
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:42,641
I was groping for some way
to keep Laura's name out of it.

893
00:59:42,766 --> 00:59:47,229
I was heartbroken about Diane
and panic-stricken about Laura.

894
00:59:47,312 --> 00:59:49,814
I haven't slept a full two hours
since this thing happened.

895
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:53,026
Let's get back to the present. What did
you and Laura talk about tonight?

896
00:59:53,109 --> 00:59:55,820
I told her the whole story,
just as I've told you.

897
00:59:57,656 --> 00:59:59,866
She phoned you after she promised me
she wouldn't call anybody.

898
00:59:59,991 --> 01:00:02,953
- What did she want?
- It's perfectly natural she should want to see me...

899
01:00:03,078 --> 01:00:04,955
especially
after what's happened.

900
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,916
Why don't you tell the truth? She sent
you here to get rid of this gun.

901
01:00:07,999 --> 01:00:11,294
She did not. It was my own idea.
She doesn't even know I'm here.

902
01:00:18,009 --> 01:00:22,222
- It works fine, doesn't it?
- Yes. Did you think it wouldn't?

903
01:00:22,305 --> 01:00:24,849
I hoped it wouldn't.
All right. Let's go.

904
01:00:26,309 --> 01:00:30,272
- Well, am I under arrest?
- No, but you're not to leave town...

905
01:00:30,397 --> 01:00:32,857
and it would be
foolish of you to try it.

906
01:00:50,235 --> 01:00:52,237
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

907
01:00:55,323 --> 01:00:57,284
- What's that?
- Breakfast.

908
01:00:57,367 --> 01:00:59,828
You didn't buy any food
when you went out last night.

909
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:09,546
I'll fix some bacon and eggs.
Can you make coffee?

910
01:01:09,671 --> 01:01:13,425
Suppose you set the table
while I get breakfast.

911
01:01:13,508 --> 01:01:15,510
Do you always sound like this
in the morning?

912
01:01:15,594 --> 01:01:17,554
Don't tell me
you can cook.

913
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:21,808
My mother always listened sympathetically
to my dreams of a career...

914
01:01:21,892 --> 01:01:24,394
and then taught me
another recipe.

915
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:27,105
Shh! Don't move.

916
01:01:31,943 --> 01:01:34,404
It's all right, Bessie.
It's all right, Bessie.

917
01:01:34,529 --> 01:01:37,949
She's alive.

918
01:01:38,075 --> 01:01:40,035
It's all been
a mistake, Bessie.

919
01:01:40,118 --> 01:01:42,996
I'm not a ghost. Really.

920
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,957
I found you,
and you were dead.

921
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:48,126
It was Miss Redfern's
body you found.

922
01:01:50,337 --> 01:01:52,506
How about
taking over here...

923
01:01:52,589 --> 01:01:55,008
fixing us some
coffee and eggs.

924
01:01:55,092 --> 01:01:59,388
But I... I saw it
with my own eyes.

925
01:01:59,471 --> 01:02:01,848
I... I don't
understand it.

926
01:02:01,932 --> 01:02:04,768
Have you ever
heard a ghost ask for eggs?

927
01:02:04,893 --> 01:02:06,853
No, miss.

928
01:02:06,978 --> 01:02:08,939
You'll be all right,
Bessie.

929
01:02:18,907 --> 01:02:22,244
Somebody should have warned her.
Poor Bessie.

930
01:02:22,369 --> 01:02:25,455
By the way, I've asked Waldo Lydecker
to come here this morning.

931
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,874
- Did you tell him?
- No.

932
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:29,960
Why not?
It's brutal.

933
01:02:30,085 --> 01:02:33,422
I'm not doing it for fun.

934
01:02:33,547 --> 01:02:36,925
Why did you break your promise
and go out and see Shelby last night?

935
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:39,177
You forced me
to give you my word.

936
01:02:39,302 --> 01:02:41,555
I never have been and I
never will be bound by anything...

937
01:02:41,638 --> 01:02:44,015
I don't do
of my own free will.

938
01:02:44,141 --> 01:02:46,852
Redfern was in love
with Carpenter.

939
01:02:46,977 --> 01:02:48,937
You admitted that
last night.

940
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:51,857
- May I have a match, please?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

941
01:02:51,982 --> 01:02:55,485
I also told you that
he wasn't in love with her.

942
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:58,071
Just sit still.

943
01:03:05,537 --> 01:03:08,331
Hello, Lieutenant.

944
01:03:08,457 --> 01:03:11,084
- Morning, my darling.
- Hello, dear.

945
01:03:11,168 --> 01:03:13,795
Ah. Thank you.

946
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,048
Oh. It's on again.

947
01:03:16,173 --> 01:03:19,843
Do I have to get a permit from the police
department to kiss my fiancee good morning?

948
01:03:19,968 --> 01:03:21,928
So he made you
change your mind.

949
01:03:22,012 --> 01:03:24,306
Speaking of changing one's mind,
Mr. McPherson...

950
01:03:24,389 --> 01:03:26,558
I have just come
from my lawyer.

951
01:03:26,641 --> 01:03:29,311
Yeah? Did he tell you how much
you'll get off for good behavior?

952
01:03:29,394 --> 01:03:31,563
No, but he told me that anything
I may have said last night...

953
01:03:31,646 --> 01:03:34,649
was said under duress
and can't be used against me.

954
01:03:34,733 --> 01:03:36,693
Besides, none of it was true.

955
01:03:36,818 --> 01:03:40,489
Smart lawyer you've got. Maybe he told you
how that scotch got up here Friday night...

956
01:03:40,614 --> 01:03:42,574
after you'd bought it
at Mosconi's.

957
01:03:42,657 --> 01:03:44,743
Maybe it was the lawyer
who brought Diane Redfern up here.

958
01:03:44,826 --> 01:03:46,828
Maybe...

959
01:03:51,375 --> 01:03:54,044
Well, McPherson...

960
01:03:54,169 --> 01:03:56,963
have you thought over
the deal I suggested?

961
01:04:00,592 --> 01:04:03,136
Waldo.

962
01:04:03,261 --> 01:04:05,222
Waldo.

963
01:04:08,809 --> 01:04:10,936
Right-hand pocket.

964
01:04:11,019 --> 01:04:13,105
You want a doctor?

965
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:15,690
Right-hand pocket.

966
01:04:15,816 --> 01:04:18,276
We'd better take him
into the bedroom.

967
01:04:30,247 --> 01:04:32,207
- What...
- Don't try and say anything, dear.

968
01:04:32,332 --> 01:04:34,334
Just be quiet.

969
01:04:36,795 --> 01:04:38,839
I think this is
carrying things too far.

970
01:04:38,964 --> 01:04:41,299
Your methods are vicious.
There ought to be a law against it.

971
01:04:41,425 --> 01:04:43,885
- Yeah?
- How does he feel now?

972
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:45,971
It was a terrible shock.
Poor darling.

973
01:04:46,054 --> 01:04:48,056
Don't tell me you're in love
with him too.

974
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:50,308
Look here, fella. You're not to talk
that way to Miss Hunt.

975
01:04:50,434 --> 01:04:52,436
Shut up. Why do you cover up
for a guy like him?

976
01:04:52,561 --> 01:04:55,147
- Don't answer him, Laura.
- What story did he tell you last night?

977
01:04:55,272 --> 01:04:57,899
- Don't answer him. Let him talk to our lawyer.
- Our lawyer?

978
01:04:57,983 --> 01:04:59,943
- So now you're covering up for each other.
- Look at him, Laura.

979
01:05:00,068 --> 01:05:02,779
He's beginning to crack up.
He'd use anything to make an arrest...

980
01:05:02,904 --> 01:05:04,865
just so he can be a big shot
in the headlines.

981
01:05:04,948 --> 01:05:06,992
I've got enough on you
to arrest you right now.

982
01:05:07,075 --> 01:05:09,077
Quick, McPherson,
the handcuffs.

983
01:05:09,161 --> 01:05:11,580
- Trundle him off to the hoosegow.
- You keep out of this.

984
01:05:11,705 --> 01:05:14,958
- You'll look nice in bracelets.
- Why don't you get down on all fours again, Waldo?

985
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:17,753
It's the only time you've ever
kept your mouth shut.

986
01:05:17,836 --> 01:05:20,797
I hope you'll forgive
my wee touch of epilepsy, my dear.

987
01:05:20,922 --> 01:05:23,050
It's an old family custom.

988
01:05:23,133 --> 01:05:26,344
Well, McPherson, what does
Laura's resurrection do to you?

989
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:29,431
Too bad Diane Redfern
can't be resurrected.

990
01:05:29,556 --> 01:05:31,933
I'm afraid I've interrupted
what you call "a pinch."

991
01:05:32,017 --> 01:05:35,020
Do your duty, McPherson.

992
01:05:35,103 --> 01:05:38,440
You know, Lydecker,
you've made me change my mind.

993
01:05:38,523 --> 01:05:40,484
- For the moment.
- Well, in that case...

994
01:05:40,609 --> 01:05:42,611
we'll have time
for a little get-together.

995
01:05:42,736 --> 01:05:46,740
- You'd better order some liquor and some food, Laura.
- What for?

996
01:05:46,865 --> 01:05:48,825
People are coming
to celebrate your return.

997
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:50,994
Ann and Bullitt and Corey.
Everybody.

998
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,289
- Who asked them to come?
- I did, when I was in there.

999
01:05:54,414 --> 01:05:56,375
I phoned my man,
and he's calling everyone.

1000
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:00,379
- Why did you do that, Waldo?
- A sense of the fitness of things, my dear.

1001
01:06:00,504 --> 01:06:04,257
Perhaps our friend can weave all the
loose ends into a noose. Eh, McPherson?

1002
01:06:04,341 --> 01:06:06,802
Sorry you went to all that trouble.
I've already called them.

1003
01:06:11,473 --> 01:06:13,433
You're working yourself
to death, darling.

1004
01:06:13,517 --> 01:06:16,853
- I haven't had a moment with you all day.
- It's a very thirsty crowd.

1005
01:06:16,978 --> 01:06:19,398
Oh, after all,
it isn't your homecoming.

1006
01:06:19,523 --> 01:06:21,983
Aren't you being
a little bit nasty, Ann?

1007
01:06:22,067 --> 01:06:24,027
I feel nasty
when I don't see you.

1008
01:06:24,152 --> 01:06:27,739
Well, you look very sweet. That's
a completely wonderful hat, darling.

1009
01:06:27,823 --> 01:06:30,826
Now, if you'll forgive me,
Laura wants a cocktail.

1010
01:06:30,951 --> 01:06:33,328
- So do I.
- Well, here you go.

1011
01:06:34,496 --> 01:06:36,957
Shelby, why don't you
come to your senses?

1012
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:40,585
You know it's all over between you
and Laura, or it soon will be.

1013
01:06:40,669 --> 01:06:44,005
But you haven't lost me.
Why don't we get married now?

1014
01:06:44,131 --> 01:06:46,842
- Ann, dear, you don't seem to realize the situation.
- Yes, but I do.

1015
01:06:46,925 --> 01:06:50,303
That's why you need me. We'll get
the best lawyer that money can buy.

1016
01:06:50,387 --> 01:06:54,015
When it's all over, we'll go away... anywhere
you want... and forget about all this.

1017
01:06:54,141 --> 01:06:57,519
Thanks, Ann, but you see,
Laura needs me. Sorry.

1018
01:07:00,188 --> 01:07:02,190
Uh-uh.

1019
01:07:04,359 --> 01:07:06,695
- Laura.
- Thanks.

1020
01:07:06,778 --> 01:07:09,531
If you don't mind,
I'd like a word with Miss Hunt.

1021
01:07:09,614 --> 01:07:12,159
I don't mind.
Talk to her as much as you like.

1022
01:07:13,577 --> 01:07:16,830
- I see he's taking a new tack.
- What do you mean?

1023
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:20,751
Trying to make you like him
to make you talk.

1024
01:07:20,876 --> 01:07:23,920
Shelby, tell me,
why did you go to...

1025
01:07:25,547 --> 01:07:27,507
Excuse me.

1026
01:07:28,842 --> 01:07:31,303
Why did you go
to the cottage last night?

1027
01:07:31,386 --> 01:07:33,388
But don't you know?
I was afraid...

1028
01:07:33,472 --> 01:07:36,224
you wouldn't think
of hiding that shotgun.

1029
01:07:36,308 --> 01:07:40,020
- What shotgun?
- The one I gave you.

1030
01:07:40,103 --> 01:07:42,439
You don't have to lie
to me, darling.

1031
01:07:42,564 --> 01:07:44,524
I'll stand by you.

1032
01:07:51,656 --> 01:07:53,950
What's the matter,
Laura?

1033
01:07:54,076 --> 01:07:57,370
Oh, I guess I'm just nervous.
That's all.

1034
01:07:57,454 --> 01:08:00,207
So am I.

1035
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:02,584
McPherson suspects Shelby.

1036
01:08:03,752 --> 01:08:05,712
He seems to suspect me too.

1037
01:08:06,838 --> 01:08:08,799
And so do
some of my friends.

1038
01:08:08,924 --> 01:08:10,926
You?
Don't be absurd.

1039
01:08:11,051 --> 01:08:13,678
- You could never do a thing like that.
- And Shelby?

1040
01:08:13,762 --> 01:08:15,764
Oh, I don't think
he did it.

1041
01:08:15,847 --> 01:08:17,808
But he's capable of it.

1042
01:08:19,768 --> 01:08:22,270
Are you as interested in McPherson
as he is in you?

1043
01:08:22,396 --> 01:08:24,523
But, Ann, I only
met him last night.

1044
01:08:24,648 --> 01:08:26,900
That's more than
long enough sometimes.

1045
01:08:26,983 --> 01:08:31,613
Anyway, he's better for you
than Shelby. Anybody is.

1046
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:35,117
- Shelby's better for me.
- Why?

1047
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:38,203
Because I can afford him,
and I understand him.

1048
01:08:39,287 --> 01:08:42,249
He's no good,
but he's what I want.

1049
01:08:42,374 --> 01:08:45,293
I'm not a nice person,
Laura. Neither is he.

1050
01:08:45,377 --> 01:08:48,922
He knows I know he's...
just what he is.

1051
01:08:49,047 --> 01:08:52,092
He also knows
that I don't care.

1052
01:08:52,217 --> 01:08:56,680
We belong together because we're
both weak and can't seem to help it.

1053
01:08:56,805 --> 01:08:59,683
That's why I know
he's capable of murder.

1054
01:08:59,808 --> 01:09:01,768
He's like me.

1055
01:09:03,729 --> 01:09:05,647
No, dear, I didn't...

1056
01:09:06,690 --> 01:09:08,650
but I thought of it.

1057
01:09:26,001 --> 01:09:29,880
Hello? Yes. Yes.

1058
01:09:30,005 --> 01:09:32,507
Oh, it's for you, Lieutenant.

1059
01:09:32,632 --> 01:09:35,010
Thank you, Bessie.

1060
01:09:35,093 --> 01:09:37,054
McPherson.

1061
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:40,807
Yeah, I know.
Don't worry.

1062
01:09:40,932 --> 01:09:42,976
I told you I'd bring in
the killer today.

1063
01:09:44,728 --> 01:09:47,022
Yeah. I was just gonna
make the arrest when you called.

1064
01:09:47,147 --> 01:09:50,692
No, I can't tell you now.
I'm not alone.

1065
01:09:53,153 --> 01:09:55,072
You'll see when I come in.

1066
01:09:55,197 --> 01:09:57,157
Right. See you later.

1067
01:10:17,094 --> 01:10:19,054
All right. Let's go.

1068
01:10:19,179 --> 01:10:20,639
- You mean...
- Yeah.

1069
01:10:20,722 --> 01:10:22,724
Oh, no!

1070
01:10:24,559 --> 01:10:26,895
No. No, no.

1071
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:29,022
Not Miss Hunt.

1072
01:10:29,147 --> 01:10:31,108
Please!

1073
01:10:32,234 --> 01:10:34,152
Thank you, Bessie.

1074
01:10:35,195 --> 01:10:37,155
Thank you.

1075
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:42,119
Now will you please be good enough
to go and get me my things?

1076
01:10:42,244 --> 01:10:44,538
- Yes, miss.
- Laura.

1077
01:10:45,706 --> 01:10:48,709
Don't worry, darling.
Let them accuse you.

1078
01:10:48,792 --> 01:10:50,752
We'll fight them.

1079
01:10:50,877 --> 01:10:54,381
I have every weapon...
money, connections, prestige.

1080
01:10:54,506 --> 01:10:59,845
And my column. Every day, millions will
read about you and rally to your defense.

1081
01:10:59,928 --> 01:11:02,639
You talk as if you wanted
to see her tried for murder.

1082
01:11:02,764 --> 01:11:08,186
Yes. Rather than let you blacken
her name with suspicions and rumors.

1083
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:13,483
Try to prove her guilty. Get on the witness
stand with your poor shreds of evidence.

1084
01:11:13,608 --> 01:11:17,863
I'll expose your cheap methods
you used on her.

1085
01:11:17,946 --> 01:11:20,907
- Thank you, Bessie.
- Laura, I told you to watch out for this fella.

1086
01:11:20,991 --> 01:11:23,160
- Can we go now?
- I warned you.

1087
01:11:25,579 --> 01:11:28,790
It's too bad you didn't
open that door Friday night, Carpenter.

1088
01:11:28,874 --> 01:11:31,793
- Wait a minute.
- Shelby!

1089
01:11:34,296 --> 01:11:36,465
Oh, did he hurt you, darling?

1090
01:11:36,548 --> 01:11:38,508
Darling.

1091
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,720
Ann.

1092
01:11:45,891 --> 01:11:48,477
Come in.

1093
01:11:48,602 --> 01:11:50,562
Sit down.

1094
01:11:51,688 --> 01:11:53,648
- That'll be all, Gallagher.
- Yes, sir.

1095
01:11:57,235 --> 01:12:01,323
All right. Let's have it.
Look at me.

1096
01:12:03,742 --> 01:12:06,161
What are you trying to do,
force a confession out of me?

1097
01:12:06,244 --> 01:12:08,747
You've been holding out,
and I want to know why.

1098
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:10,832
It'll be easier for you
if you tell the truth.

1099
01:12:12,334 --> 01:12:14,753
What difference
does it make what I say?

1100
01:12:14,836 --> 01:12:17,005
You've made up your mind
I'm guilty.

1101
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:20,884
- Are you?
- Don't tell me you have any doubts.

1102
01:12:21,009 --> 01:12:23,637
Since you...
Oh, I can't.

1103
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,847
Please. Do I have to have
those lights in my face?

1104
01:12:32,229 --> 01:12:36,316
Thanks. No, I didn't
kill Diane Redfern...

1105
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,360
or anyone else.

1106
01:12:39,861 --> 01:12:42,322
Then why...

1107
01:12:42,406 --> 01:12:45,617
Why did you tell me the radio
at your country place was broken?

1108
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:47,911
- Because it was broken.
- Not when I tried it.

1109
01:12:48,036 --> 01:12:51,039
Just as I was leaving the village,
I asked the local handyman to fix it.

1110
01:12:51,164 --> 01:12:55,085
- How did he get in?
- I always leave a key under the flowerpot on the porch.

1111
01:12:55,210 --> 01:13:00,090
You're too intelligent to make up
something I could check so easily...

1112
01:13:00,215 --> 01:13:05,137
but you're intelligent enough to have
broken it yourself to strengthen your story.

1113
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:08,974
The main thing I want to know is why you
pulled that switch on me about Carpenter.

1114
01:13:09,057 --> 01:13:12,561
You told me last night
you decided not to marry him.

1115
01:13:12,686 --> 01:13:17,023
- Yes, I guess I did.
- But today it was on again. Why?

1116
01:13:17,107 --> 01:13:21,361
Well, I...
I changed my mind.

1117
01:13:21,445 --> 01:13:25,907
What are you trying to hide? Don't you
realize you're involved in a murder?

1118
01:13:25,991 --> 01:13:28,869
You've got yourself in a jam it's not
going to be easy to get out of...

1119
01:13:28,952 --> 01:13:30,996
unless you're on the level
with me.

1120
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:33,582
This is no time for secrets.

1121
01:13:33,665 --> 01:13:35,751
Now, did you really decide
to call it off...

1122
01:13:35,876 --> 01:13:39,421
or did you just tell me that because
you knew I wanted to hear it?

1123
01:13:43,925 --> 01:13:46,928
What went on between you and Carpenter
when you saw him last night?

1124
01:13:47,054 --> 01:13:49,473
Did he persuade you to make up?

1125
01:13:50,807 --> 01:13:53,018
Or did you agree
to pretend you had?

1126
01:13:53,101 --> 01:13:56,563
- Was that it?
- Well, we... That is, both of us thought...

1127
01:13:56,646 --> 01:13:59,191
He convinced you that if you
broke the engagement now...

1128
01:13:59,274 --> 01:14:02,069
people would think
you believed he was guilty.

1129
01:14:02,152 --> 01:14:05,614
Yes, but now I know it was only
because he thought I was.

1130
01:14:05,739 --> 01:14:08,700
- Did you believe he was guilty?
- No. I'm sure he isn't.

1131
01:14:08,784 --> 01:14:11,745
But he'd gotten himself
into an awfully suspicious position...

1132
01:14:11,828 --> 01:14:15,290
and he's the sort of man that people are
always ready to believe the worst about.

1133
01:14:16,792 --> 01:14:18,794
Are you in love with him?

1134
01:14:23,131 --> 01:14:25,258
I don't see how
I ever could have been.

1135
01:14:29,888 --> 01:14:31,848
Come on.
You're going home.

1136
01:14:34,309 --> 01:14:37,646
- But I thought I was...
- That's... That's what I wanted you to think.

1137
01:14:37,771 --> 01:14:40,982
You and a few others.
I didn't even book you.

1138
01:14:41,066 --> 01:14:43,276
You mean this was
some sort of a game?

1139
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,154
I was 99% certain
about you...

1140
01:14:46,279 --> 01:14:48,615
but I had to get rid of
that one percent doubt.

1141
01:14:48,698 --> 01:14:51,785
Wasn't there
an easier way to make sure?

1142
01:14:51,868 --> 01:14:55,288
I'd... reached a point
where I needed official surroundings.

1143
01:14:57,290 --> 01:14:59,876
Then it was worth it, Mark.

1144
01:15:02,963 --> 01:15:04,923
I'll call a cab for you.

1145
01:15:18,353 --> 01:15:20,397
Good night.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1146
01:15:20,522 --> 01:15:22,482
Good night, Mark.

1147
01:15:23,734 --> 01:15:25,694
I'm going over
to Lydecker's apartment.

1148
01:16:48,902 --> 01:16:50,904
It still doesn't
make sense to me, Laura.

1149
01:16:50,987 --> 01:16:53,657
He's playing some sort
of a game with you.

1150
01:16:53,782 --> 01:16:56,451
- I don't think so.
- I don't deny that he's infatuated with you...

1151
01:16:56,535 --> 01:16:59,871
in some warped way
of his own.

1152
01:16:59,955 --> 01:17:03,917
But he isn't capable of any normal,
warm human relationship.

1153
01:17:04,042 --> 01:17:06,586
He's been dealing
with criminals too long.

1154
01:17:09,131 --> 01:17:11,425
When you were unattainable...
when he thought you were dead...

1155
01:17:11,508 --> 01:17:13,468
that's when
he wanted you most.

1156
01:17:13,593 --> 01:17:15,554
But he was glad
when I came back...

1157
01:17:15,637 --> 01:17:17,639
as if he were
waiting for me.

1158
01:17:17,723 --> 01:17:21,017
Do you know what
he calls women? "Dames."

1159
01:17:21,143 --> 01:17:24,479
A "dame" in Washington Heights
got a fox fur out of him.

1160
01:17:24,563 --> 01:17:28,108
- His very words.
- That doesn't mean anything.

1161
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:30,318
He isn't like that.

1162
01:17:30,444 --> 01:17:33,363
Laura, you have
one tragic weakness.

1163
01:17:33,488 --> 01:17:36,533
With you, a lean, strong body
is the measure of a man...

1164
01:17:36,658 --> 01:17:38,618
and you always get hurt.

1165
01:17:40,203 --> 01:17:42,789
No man is ever
going to hurt me again.

1166
01:17:42,914 --> 01:17:45,834
No one, not even you.

1167
01:17:45,917 --> 01:17:49,337
I? Hurt you?

1168
01:17:49,421 --> 01:17:51,506
Laura, look at me.

1169
01:17:53,842 --> 01:17:57,054
When a man has everything
in the world that he wants...

1170
01:17:57,179 --> 01:18:00,307
except what he wants most...

1171
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:02,768
he loses his self-respect.

1172
01:18:02,851 --> 01:18:05,812
It makes him bitter, Laura.

1173
01:18:05,896 --> 01:18:08,440
He wants to hurt someone
as he's been hurt.

1174
01:18:10,817 --> 01:18:14,154
You were a long time
in finding out about Shelby...

1175
01:18:14,237 --> 01:18:18,325
but... that's over now.

1176
01:18:18,408 --> 01:18:22,079
We'll be back together again.

1177
01:18:22,204 --> 01:18:25,540
Haven't you heard of science's
newest triumph... the doorbell?

1178
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:29,211
I don't like to remind her.

1179
01:18:31,046 --> 01:18:35,801
- That was the murderer's signal.
- Did you eavesdrop too? I hope.

1180
01:18:35,884 --> 01:18:39,930
I thought you'd like to know. We
tested your shotgun. It isn't the one.

1181
01:18:40,055 --> 01:18:42,391
Now, that's what I call
a typical move...

1182
01:18:42,474 --> 01:18:45,477
a real key
to the man's character.

1183
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:47,854
First he tells you that
he thinks you're innocent...

1184
01:18:47,938 --> 01:18:50,023
then proceeds
to check up on you.

1185
01:18:50,148 --> 01:18:52,192
When I report that I think
she's innocent...

1186
01:18:52,275 --> 01:18:54,486
that's my own personal opinion.

1187
01:18:54,569 --> 01:18:57,197
When I submit proof, it becomes
the opinion of the department.

1188
01:18:57,322 --> 01:18:59,574
This entire maneuver could be a trick
to get you off your guard.

1189
01:18:59,699 --> 01:19:01,827
It could be, but it isn't.

1190
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:05,622
- I believe you, Mark.
- It's the same obvious pattern, Laura.

1191
01:19:05,747 --> 01:19:09,418
If McPherson weren't muscular and
handsome in a cheap sort of way...

1192
01:19:09,543 --> 01:19:11,503
you'd see through him
in a second.

1193
01:19:11,586 --> 01:19:15,048
Waldo, I mean to be
as kind about this as I know how...

1194
01:19:15,173 --> 01:19:19,553
but I must tell you-you're the one who
follows the same obvious pattern.

1195
01:19:19,636 --> 01:19:21,972
First it was Jacoby, then Shelby.
And now I suppose...

1196
01:19:22,097 --> 01:19:24,683
- Laura, I...
- I don't think we should see each other again.

1197
01:19:24,766 --> 01:19:28,729
- You're not yourself, darling.
- Yes, I am.

1198
01:19:28,854 --> 01:19:32,274
For the first time in ages,
I know what I'm doing.

1199
01:19:34,609 --> 01:19:36,862
Very well.

1200
01:19:36,945 --> 01:19:39,573
I hope you'll never regret
what promises to be...

1201
01:19:39,656 --> 01:19:42,451
a disgustingly
earthy relationship.

1202
01:19:44,202 --> 01:19:46,997
My congratulations, McPherson.

1203
01:19:47,122 --> 01:19:50,250
Listen to my broadcast
in 15 minutes.

1204
01:19:50,333 --> 01:19:53,128
I'm discussing
great lovers of history.

1205
01:20:12,814 --> 01:20:18,153
- It was the most difficult thing
I ever had to do in my life.

1206
01:20:18,236 --> 01:20:20,655
All I need is the gun.

1207
01:20:25,035 --> 01:20:29,039
- What are you doing?
- Do you know the combination to this thing?

1208
01:20:29,164 --> 01:20:32,793
- I never knew it had one.
- It must be somewhere. Oh.

1209
01:20:44,721 --> 01:20:48,809
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.

1210
01:20:48,934 --> 01:20:51,686
Waldo gave you that clock,
didn't he?

1211
01:20:51,812 --> 01:20:53,772
Yes.

1212
01:20:55,148 --> 01:20:57,234
The doorbell rang...

1213
01:20:57,359 --> 01:21:00,153
and Diane Redfern
went to the door in your negligee.

1214
01:21:01,738 --> 01:21:05,200
She opened the door.
The room was dark.

1215
01:21:06,743 --> 01:21:09,663
Waldo saw a girl standing there,
and he assumed it was you.

1216
01:21:10,997 --> 01:21:12,958
He figured that if
he couldn't have you himself...

1217
01:21:13,041 --> 01:21:15,043
he was gonna make sure
that nobody else did.

1218
01:21:15,127 --> 01:21:17,129
So he let her have it...

1219
01:21:20,716 --> 01:21:22,718
with both barrels,
right in the face.

1220
01:21:25,011 --> 01:21:27,848
She fell here.

1221
01:21:27,931 --> 01:21:30,851
Waldo heard Shelby running
from the next room...

1222
01:21:30,934 --> 01:21:33,311
so he hid
in the stairway outside.

1223
01:21:35,147 --> 01:21:38,024
Shelby was scared,
so he ran out as fast as he could.

1224
01:21:38,108 --> 01:21:41,403
Then Waldo came back
and placed the gun in that clock.

1225
01:21:43,697 --> 01:21:45,657
I knew it.

1226
01:21:45,741 --> 01:21:48,201
I've felt it
ever since I came back...

1227
01:21:48,285 --> 01:21:50,704
but I didn't want
to believe it.

1228
01:21:50,787 --> 01:21:53,582
I couldn't make myself
believe that...

1229
01:21:53,707 --> 01:21:56,543
Waldo was a murderer.

1230
01:21:56,626 --> 01:22:00,672
- Well, he is.
- He didn't really kill Diane Redfern.

1231
01:22:00,756 --> 01:22:02,966
- I killed her.
- What are you talking about?

1232
01:22:03,091 --> 01:22:07,471
But I did, Mark. I did as surely
as if I'd pulled the trigger myself.

1233
01:22:07,596 --> 01:22:09,556
That's nonsense.
Forget it.

1234
01:22:09,639 --> 01:22:13,518
No, Mark, I can't.
I'm as guilty as he is...

1235
01:22:13,602 --> 01:22:17,731
not for anything I did,
but for what I didn't do.

1236
01:22:19,274 --> 01:22:23,278
But I couldn't help myself.
I owed him too much.

1237
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,869
I can understand that,
Laura...

1238
01:22:30,952 --> 01:22:34,706
but I can't understand why you've tried so
hard to protect Shelby these last few days.

1239
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:37,000
I was nearly frantic for fear
you'd arrest Shelby.

1240
01:22:37,125 --> 01:22:40,087
I knew he wasn't guilty.
He hasn't enough courage to kill a fly.

1241
01:22:40,212 --> 01:22:43,340
And Waldo was doing everything
he could to incriminate him.

1242
01:22:43,465 --> 01:22:45,550
It was his way
of getting rid of Shelby...

1243
01:22:45,634 --> 01:22:47,636
just as he did Jacoby.

1244
01:22:50,305 --> 01:22:52,474
I must say, for a charming,
intelligent girl...

1245
01:22:52,599 --> 01:22:56,228
you've certainly surrounded yourself
with a remarkable collection of dopes.

1246
01:22:57,979 --> 01:23:00,774
Don't touch anything.
Fingerprints will be important.

1247
01:23:03,068 --> 01:23:05,028
I'll have the clock
picked up tomorrow.

1248
01:23:05,153 --> 01:23:07,239
- What are you going to do?
- Arrest Waldo.

1249
01:23:07,322 --> 01:23:09,950
- Mark.
- Can't be helped.

1250
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:19,126
That's to make sure
you're not disturbed.

1251
01:23:19,209 --> 01:23:21,628
If the doorbell rings,
don't answer it.

1252
01:23:21,712 --> 01:23:25,549
- I'll phone you in the morning.
- Good night, Mark.

1253
01:23:25,674 --> 01:23:28,802
Get some sleep. Forget
the whole thing like a bad dream.

1254
01:25:21,206 --> 01:25:25,168
And thus,
as history has proved, love is eternal.

1255
01:25:25,293 --> 01:25:29,131
It has been the strongest motivation
for human actions...

1256
01:25:29,214 --> 01:25:31,425
throughout centuries.

1257
01:25:31,508 --> 01:25:34,052
Love is stronger than life.

1258
01:25:34,136 --> 01:25:36,722
It reaches beyond
the dark shadow of death.

1259
01:25:37,931 --> 01:25:40,308
I close this evening's
broadcast...

1260
01:25:40,392 --> 01:25:43,395
with some favorite lines
from Dowson.

1261
01:25:43,478 --> 01:25:45,480
"Brief Life."

1262
01:25:47,315 --> 01:25:51,319
"They are not long,
the weeping and the laughter...

1263
01:25:51,445 --> 01:25:54,448
"love and desire
and hate.

1264
01:25:55,824 --> 01:25:58,285
"I think they have
no portion in us...

1265
01:25:58,410 --> 01:26:01,163
after we pass the gate."

1266
01:26:01,288 --> 01:26:04,791
- Who's tailing Lydecker?
- I was going to, when he came out.

1267
01:26:04,875 --> 01:26:07,711
- He left five minutes ago.
- He didn't come out this way.

1268
01:26:07,836 --> 01:26:11,048
Must've gone out the back way.
Come on. Let's check.

1269
01:26:11,173 --> 01:26:16,762
"They are
not long, the days of wine and roses.

1270
01:26:16,845 --> 01:26:20,974
"Out of a misty dream,
our path emerges for a while...

1271
01:26:21,099 --> 01:26:23,435
then closes within a dream."

1272
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,647
- That's the way it is, isn't it, Laura?
- Waldo!

1273
01:26:27,773 --> 01:26:30,108
You have
heard the voice of Waldo Lydecker...

1274
01:26:30,192 --> 01:26:32,110
by electrical transcription.

1275
01:26:32,194 --> 01:26:36,448
Waldo, you've taken one life.
Isn't that enough?

1276
01:26:36,531 --> 01:26:41,161
The best part of myself...
that's what you are.

1277
01:26:41,286 --> 01:26:43,997
Do you think I'm going to leave it
to the vulgar pawing...

1278
01:26:44,081 --> 01:26:47,292
of a second-rate detective
who thinks you're a dame?

1279
01:26:47,376 --> 01:26:50,128
Do you think I could bear the thought
of him holding you in his arms...

1280
01:26:50,212 --> 01:26:52,839
kissing you, loving you?

1281
01:26:53,882 --> 01:26:56,218
Laura! It's Mark.
Open the door!

1282
01:26:56,301 --> 01:26:58,345
- There he is now.
- Laura!

1283
01:26:58,428 --> 01:27:01,890
He'll find us together, Laura...

1284
01:27:01,973 --> 01:27:05,227
as we always have been, as we always
should be, as we always will be.

1285
01:27:13,151 --> 01:27:15,070
Mark!

1286
01:27:26,248 --> 01:27:28,250
Good-bye, Laura.

1287
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:40,095
Good-bye, my love.
