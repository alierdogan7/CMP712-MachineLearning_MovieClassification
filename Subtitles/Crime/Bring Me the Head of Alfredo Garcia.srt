1
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,237
Miss Theresa.

2
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,989
Your father is waiting for you.

3
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:55,824
I know.

4
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,118
Right now, my sweet.

5
00:01:58,202 --> 00:01:59,745
I don't want to go.

6
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,624
Poor thing.

7
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,849
Your father wants you immediately!

8
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:23,972
Who is the father?

9
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:31,813
Who is the father?

10
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,570
Who is the father?

11
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,036
No!

12
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,708
Alfredo Garcia!

13
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,886
He was like a son to me.

14
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,647
I'll pay a million
to whoever brings me

15
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,607
the head of Afredo Garcia.

16
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,946
Bring me the head
of Alfredo Garcia.

17
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,533
Bring it to me!

18
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,192
-Do you care for a drink, sir?
-Uh, later.

19
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:07,696
Excuse me.

20
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:19,208
Welcome to Camino Real, sir.
-Thank you.

21
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,542
Enjoy your stay.

22
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:26,798
Mirado first, and then
la Munica, Goldendrina, and Toro.

23
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:39,663
Sing it, brothers.

24
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,124
Ladies and gentlemen...

25
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,838
...the bus us ready to leave in
two minutes. Please, let's go.

26
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,724
Good-bye my brothers from Ohio.

27
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,518
Good-bye my brothers from Norway.

28
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,731
Take your wooden hearts out
and find the soul in Mexico.

29
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,817
And bring back money.
Spend money all over, folks.

30
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:11,862
Have a good time,
but remember the Tlaquepaque.

31
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,250
Four tequila.

32
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,590
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

33
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,804
We are looking for an old
buddy of ours. A padre named Alfredo Garcia.

34
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,516
Does anyone here know him,
if you please.

35
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:41,600
Mrs.

36
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:45,437
Miss?

37
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:50,734
You're sure, huh?

38
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:53,946
How about you?

39
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:56,990
No, Senor.

40
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,581
First drink's on the house, gentlemen.

41
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:20,222
Whatta you like to hear?

42
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,061
Take care of those gentlemen, Paulo.

43
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,063
Your wishes, gentlemen?

44
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,233
-Tequila.
-Uh, Tequila and a beer back.

45
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:38,782
Good evenig.

46
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,706
Something, uh, for the ladies.

47
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:51,628
Come on, whatta you wanna hear?

48
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,548
Who knows?
What would you like?

49
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:59,136
How about,
uh, 'l Remember April'?

50
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,263
I remember April. Yeah.

51
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:03,140
-Excuse me.
What's that?

52
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,392
Oh, it's just an old song.

53
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,146
Now, how about buying you a drink?

54
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:12,482
Crazy. Gimme a double
Jack Daniels on the rocks.

55
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:13,984
We've got a live one here.

56
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,824
Take me to your leader.

57
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:27,206
Well, cheers, money...

58
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:31,960
How do you like that beer?

59
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:36,048
You know they brought, uh,
German Burgermeisters over here

60
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:37,883
back in about eighteen
hundred and something.

61
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,635
Who knows? Long time ago.

62
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,763
Some of the best beet in the
world comes from Mexico.

63
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,974
How good you are.

64
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:14,378
How you guys like baseball?

65
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,176
Take her away.

66
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,484
I'm beginning to like basketball lately,
it's a faster game,

67
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:38,861
you know what I mean?

68
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,239
How about that Bill Russel on the
Celtic, Nineteen sixty-nine?

69
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,824
Now, there was a ball player.

70
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,369
You've, uh, worked around
here quite awhile, huh?

71
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,372
Yeah, about six years.

72
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:54,793
Started up in the Black Cat in T.J.
Now there was a nice place.

73
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,754
Classy place, classy
people came in there.

74
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:01,133
One night Paulette Goddard came in...
and asked me if I knew...

75
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:03,260
You know a lot of
studs around here?

76
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,769
Who you looking for?

77
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:18,525
Well, like I said, an old buddy
of ours, a very close chum,

78
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:20,402
like to meet up with him again.

79
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,574
He's quite a ladies' man.
His name is Alfredo Garcia.

80
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,368
Maybe you can help is find him.

81
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:33,498
He's about thirty. Sometimes
he calls himself Al...Garcia.

82
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:38,921
He speaks English,
Spanish and a little French.

83
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,009
Quite a stud, huh?

84
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:52,976
I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
You got me.

85
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,938
I do recognize the name.

86
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,899
You know the name Garcia?

87
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:04,154
Sure, it's like Jones or Smith.

88
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,450
We're at the Hotel Camino Real,

89
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,286
if you come up with anything
we'd be glad to see you.

90
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:13,580
Bring that with you.

91
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,500
Well, don't worry,
if he's alive, I'll find him.

92
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,044
Uh, alive isn't our problem.

93
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:23,715
Well, uh, how about dead or alive?
How about that?

94
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,426
Dead, just dead.

95
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,515
What would you like to hear?

96
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,693
I didn't catch your name, Mister?

97
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:47,865
Dobbs. Fred C. Dobbs.

98
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,210
Paulo!

99
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:03,630
What's up?

100
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,968
When was the last time
Al Garcia was around?

101
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,054
One week. At the most a week.

102
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,227
You know anybody around here that...
might know where he is?

103
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,397
Elita.

104
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,401
He has stayed with her.

105
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:26,445
Elita.

106
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:30,657
No shit?

107
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,578
I'll be dammed.

108
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,053
Ola, Benny.

109
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:55,057
Smiley. Long wat from Durango,
aren't you, Pard?

110
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:05,025
Ah, lemme see.
Things have changed.

111
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:08,445
Hey... put my shoe back.

112
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,092
Get up.

113
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:32,761
Excuse me.

114
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,602
What are you doing here so early?

115
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:46,733
It's later than you think, Chula.
How'd you like a black eye?

116
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,570
What have you been drinking?

117
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:54,533
You're a lying, cheating,
no-good two-bit bitch.

118
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,911
How's your, how's your cold?

119
00:17:58,328 --> 00:17:59,580
What cold?

120
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:03,041
The one you had last week when
I couldn't see you for three days.

121
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:08,630
Ha, what'd the matter?
Ha, waht's the matter... Benny?

122
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,847
Ah, good evening.

123
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:22,019
Yeah, well, give me a double
bourbon with a champagne back

124
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,354
and none of your Texano bullshit...
now shove off.

125
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:27,357
Three days... and three nights.

126
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,569
Alfredo Garcia.

127
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,196
Si, Alfredo.

128
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,700
I feel very bad, uh...

129
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,458
Give me a chance I'll
explain it to you, olkay?

130
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,459
Do... it.

131
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:51,924
Well, he was here and
we spent some time together.

132
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:56,386
We were saying goodbye...
forever.

133
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,392
It took a little time.

134
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:04,603
If I ever get my hands on him
I'm gonna kill him.

135
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,192
I'm afraid it's too late.

136
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:18,283
When he left here he was very
drunk, and, uh, near Salti1 19...

137
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,871
his car refused the road
and the rocks killed him.

138
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:30,671
Jesus Christ.
-Amen.

139
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,675
I gotta go, Elita.

140
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,887
-Do you have to go?
-See you later.

141
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,112
Pardon.

142
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:49,499
Come in.

143
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:00,636
Glasses.

144
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,147
Give him your number.

145
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,986
Eleven. Lucky.

146
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,784
Bet you guys didn't expect
to see me so soon, huh?

147
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,537
You're wasting our time.
What have you got?

148
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:30,082
You don't mess around, do you?
Right down to business.

149
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:31,792
It's really very simple.

150
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:38,924
If you give us the information we want,
as to where we can find Alfredo Garcia,

151
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,009
we'll give you a thousand dollars.

152
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:48,892
If your information is wrong... you,
too are wrong... dead wrong.

153
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:57,526
Well, you see,
he's uh, friend of a friend.

154
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,778
And I'd like to know
what you want him for.

155
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:13,250
Well. that's not true. Uh, I mean,
I gotta tell somebody something right?

156
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:19,131
You're interested in money, aren't you?
Money you can spend.

157
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:22,426
Yes, sir. lndirectly.

158
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,221
I mean, there are other things.
Like I'd like to stay alive.

159
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,182
A loser.

160
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,309
Nobody loses all the time.

161
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:35,522
I don't like the money.
How much is it worth to you?

162
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:38,066
We can go five thousand.
-Ten thousand.

163
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:42,070
-I go all the way or I pass.
-l... gather by that you mean dead?

164
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:44,364
That's right.
That's what I got in mind.

165
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:47,951
Well. my friend, one must
do what one must do.

166
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:54,499
All we require from you...
is physical proof that Garcia is dead.

167
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:56,543
What kind of physical proof?

168
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:02,007
We're well aware of the problem and
we're prepared to settle for his head.

169
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:08,347
Yeah, but the, uh...
head must match the picture.

170
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:10,599
It's a deal.

171
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:15,312
But I want five thousand dollars in advance.
I'll need some operating cash, right?

172
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,397
You don't have to kill
him with kindness.

173
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,441
Give him two hundred dollars.

174
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,124
Well, thank you, gentlemen.

175
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,961
You've got four days.

176
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:42,673
And Benny... after that
we come to find you.

177
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:19,478
Ow! Goddammit!

178
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:15,784
Change the sheets, darling.
I got another job. You hear me?

179
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:19,413
Get up!

180
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:44,813
Come on, honey.
It's your room.

181
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:54,865
-Don't!
-Up and at 'em, Goddammit!

182
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:57,034
-Oh, don't.
-Hey, Elita!

183
00:26:57,034 --> 00:27:00,078
Don't. Cut it out.

184
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:03,123
Hey, I saw those guys that were
looking for Alfredo... yesterday.

185
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,503
Did you tell them he was dead?

186
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:08,670
No.

187
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:12,007
Why not?

188
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:13,509
In this house we know nothing.

189
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:19,097
I wanna see his grave.

190
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:26,146
Tell me...

191
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:30,400
did he give you a good head?

192
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:33,654
You... dirty man.

193
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:37,449
You dirty, lousy, son-of-a-gun.

194
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,162
Oh, don't hurt me.

195
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:48,335
Now... pack a lunch.

196
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:53,549
No, you pack. You pack, you hear,
'cause we're going on a picnic.

197
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:54,675
Oh, no.

198
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:56,927
I'm gonna find a golden fleece, baby.

199
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:00,305
What is all this, Benny?

200
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:02,891
Just get up.
-Oh, okay.

201
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:09,565
Get up! Get up, come on.

202
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:11,400
All right... I am up!

203
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,652
-Up, up!
-Can't you see?

204
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:14,820
Get up.

205
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:20,742
Oh, no. Oh, don't play with
my hangover, please, Benny.

206
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:25,080
Come on.

207
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,416
Do you want one?

208
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:34,047
Oh, yes, the paper is in the, in the...

209
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:42,431
Goodbye.

210
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:45,559
Goodbye. Hope everything
goes well. Have a nice trip.

211
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:55,319
Let me pass.
I have a heavy load.

212
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,919
Stop here for your ice cream.

213
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:09,643
Give me a little kiss, coyote.

214
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:17,025
Jesus... Christ.

215
00:30:17,943 --> 00:30:19,486
It doesn't matter, baby...

216
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:22,739
as long as I'm with you
I don't give a damn.

217
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:37,254
Enough already, Chalo.

218
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:44,219
Have pity, Chalo?

219
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:46,680
-Enough.
-It's not bothering.

220
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:52,227
Hungry, baby?

221
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:54,479
A little. But not for corn.

222
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:57,566
Meat in the pot, honey.

223
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:10,621
Bravo... bravo.

224
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:13,415
-Hell, I wasn't trying to hit 'em, you know.
-I know... you weren't.

225
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,710
I used to shoot a lot of pistols
when I was in the army.

226
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:18,545
You're a nice gringo.

227
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:21,590
You didn't have a thing
to do in the army, anyway.

228
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:23,717
Oh, you'd be surprised, honey.

229
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,488
-Don't bug me about it.
-You are a stupid son-of-a-bitch.

230
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:27,865
Let's go.

231
00:32:55,976 --> 00:33:02,024
Then we'll go to Cozumel,
after that the lsle of Mujeres.

232
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:04,193
-You ever been there?
-No.

233
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:06,862
I haven't either.

234
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:11,491
Hell, I've never been anyplace I went to
go back to that's for dammed sure.

235
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:17,414
I was once at a place
I'd like to see again.

236
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:20,209
Yeah? Absolutely, baby, you name it.

237
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:25,881
It's called Guanajato.
With a G. Guanajato.

238
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,050
Guanajato.

239
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:30,844
Yes. It's very good.

240
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:36,600
It's a beautiful...
old Spanish town.

241
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:43,649
It's, uh, sixteenth century. Lemme see,
sixteen, uh, seventeen century.

242
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:46,693
I dunno. I get mixed
up with the centuries.

243
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:51,448
Yes, because...
This town, oh, well, never... mind.

244
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:57,246
You know, and they have
tunnels built all over the town.

245
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,625
And on top of the tunnels
there's the, the houses built.

246
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,961
You can see the little windows,
you know, hanging out.

247
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:06,380
-Yeah.
-Beautiful, you'll like it there.

248
00:34:06,797 --> 00:34:08,507
I was there once with a...

249
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:14,096
Yeah, with who?

250
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:16,807
I forget.

251
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,226
Can we go there? Sometime?

252
00:34:22,104 --> 00:34:26,149
No, we'll go someplace new.

253
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:29,695
Can we find a new place?

254
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:33,782
With Alfredo's help we
can do anything, honey.

255
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:36,535
Uh, we're not doing bad.

256
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:42,249
I'll go on doing commercials and,
pretty soon you can buy your place.

257
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:48,255
Bullshit, baby, that's not my place.
Just a pit stop for a bunch of tourists.

258
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:52,301
-This time I'm moving up.
-My son.

259
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:54,386
We're moving up.

260
00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:59,641
And most important, at last to me is,
we're together, Benny.

261
00:34:59,975 --> 00:35:01,560
We're together.

262
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,777
And we marry some day.
In a church.

263
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:15,866
Yeah, We'll marry
some day in a church.

264
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:20,621
Bullshit, Benny!

265
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:24,041
-Naw, I mean it this time.
When?

266
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:25,834
When?

267
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,964
Sunday.

268
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:36,011
Why so?

269
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:46,939
Why?

270
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:52,319
Because I figure Al's worth
about ten thousand bucks.

271
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:55,864
I don't understand.

272
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:06,291
Your primera amor, my darling,
has, uh, made a mistake.

273
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:11,839
And some people... want him dead.

274
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:15,884
l... You're kidding?

275
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:21,682
No, I'm not kidding.

276
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,977
And we're gonna get some proof.

277
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,313
Jesus, y...

278
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:39,157
Well, l... Not with me, huh? You don't want
me to be part of that, do you?

279
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:41,410
You are a part of it.

280
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:46,665
For you or for me

281
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:50,544
or do it for Al.

282
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:54,256
He wants you to be happy, but...

283
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,302
Didn't he always watching you happy.

284
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:03,390
Yes, I would be happy...

285
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:12,232
Well, it's good knowing
what you want, Benny.

286
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:14,610
But it so happens
I don't know what I want.

287
00:37:15,986 --> 00:37:19,239
You see, uh... we, we,
women have so many ways.

288
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,075
l, I'm just shocked.

289
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:26,079
Salud Alfredo.

290
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:32,294
Salud Alfredo, right?

291
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:38,175
I guess he'd want
me to be happy.

292
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:41,386
Yeah.

293
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:44,848
Yeah...

294
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:57,194
Benny?

295
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:01,490
Yeah?

296
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:05,035
Have you really thought
about marrying me?

297
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:08,080
I mean seriously?

298
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:14,169
Have you?

299
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:17,965
Yes, I have.

300
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:23,303
How come you never asked me?

301
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:36,066
I don't know,
but I do now.

302
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:56,044
Ask me again.

303
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:01,508
Ask me.

304
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:08,056
Will you marry me?

305
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:18,293
Coyote! Coyote...

306
00:40:21,213 --> 00:40:23,382
Let's not sleep in the city tonight.

307
00:40:27,052 --> 00:40:30,514
I brought some blankets and food.
Everything we need.

308
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:36,603
I'll fix a dinner for you and
we can sleep under the stars.

309
00:40:38,522 --> 00:40:40,816
I wanna make you
so happy tonight.

310
00:41:26,195 --> 00:41:30,991
We butting in?
-Yeah, a little bit.

311
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:33,535
Well, we'll leave if you want us to.

312
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:36,038
That fire looks mighty good, though.

313
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:40,250
Hey, I think I got a cold from
that chick... last week.

314
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:42,878
She was hacking like
a Goddamn coal miner.

315
00:41:43,921 --> 00:41:45,130
Play anything?

316
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:49,593
Not much. My wife does.

317
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:56,308
No kidding? Hey... you know an old
song called Cielto Lindo...

318
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,434
Yes.

319
00:41:57,684 --> 00:42:01,480
How about that? Hey...
could she play it?

320
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,529
If you please.

321
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:25,439
Say, that guitar is like a woman.
Just like a woman.

322
00:43:30,694 --> 00:43:33,655
She'll be good
if you can get her.

323
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:39,536
She'll tremble when you touch her.

324
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:41,413
Okay, man, knock it off.

325
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,001
But she just keeps on getting better.

326
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:52,132
Looky what I got.
you wanna borrowie it?

327
00:43:52,716 --> 00:43:53,759
Yeah.

328
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,766
Well, I think I'll just borrow... yours.

329
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:09,358
It's all right, Benny.
It's all right.

330
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:14,863
You two guys are...
definitely on my shit list.

331
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:18,992
He's a rotten sport, your old man.

332
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:26,208
Let's get out of here. Come on.

333
00:44:28,085 --> 00:44:30,879
I'm gonna kill you one day,
you gringo son-of-a-bitch!

334
00:44:30,963 --> 00:44:32,840
Oh, no, you won't, Benny.

335
00:44:32,923 --> 00:44:35,217
I've been here before,
you don't know the way.

336
00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:41,742
What the hell, she can handle it
a lot better than I can.

337
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,620
She sure can.

338
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:52,414
Please don't.

339
00:47:58,670 --> 00:47:59,713
Please.

340
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:12,559
Gimme that bottle, Goddammit!

341
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:34,581
Son-of-a-bitch!

342
00:49:18,709 --> 00:49:22,004
Hey! You're dirt!

343
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:44,109
Come on. Let's get out of here.

344
00:49:46,612 --> 00:49:47,654
Come on.

345
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:01,210
I don't know what to say.

346
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:04,421
Dammit the hell,
I don't know what to say.

347
00:50:05,464 --> 00:50:10,761
You did all right.
I will tell everything to the police.

348
00:50:10,886 --> 00:50:12,304
No chance.

349
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:17,518
You're gonna take me to find Alfredo.
And that's our ticket outta here.

350
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:25,400
Jesus, I don't know how you
can get money from a dead body,

351
00:50:25,442 --> 00:50:28,946
I mean, I don't believe those
people and what they say.

352
00:50:29,029 --> 00:50:31,907
I take 'em proof.
His head.

353
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:37,037
-His... head?
-For proof!

354
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:40,415
But it's a crime, Benny...
you're mad!

355
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:42,709
He's dead! Shut up!

356
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:46,505
Well, you want me to desecrate a grave?

357
00:50:47,923 --> 00:50:49,883
Don't give me that crap!

358
00:50:52,094 --> 00:50:54,596
There's nothing sacred
about a hole in the ground...

359
00:50:55,514 --> 00:51:00,227
or a man that's in it... or you, or me.

360
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:10,279
Listen, the church
cuts off the feet, fingers,

361
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:14,241
any other Goddamn thing
from the saints, don't they?

362
00:51:14,324 --> 00:51:18,203
Well, what the hell, Alfredo's our saint.
He's a saint of our money.

363
00:51:18,287 --> 00:51:19,872
And I'm gonna borrow a piece of him.

364
00:51:19,955 --> 00:51:21,290
All right...

365
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:26,962
I'll take you to him and then
I'm gonna go, you know.

366
00:51:28,672 --> 00:51:33,969
Cause I figure everything
is gonna be over with us.

367
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:36,889
I don't want any more of that.

368
00:51:36,972 --> 00:51:42,311
Oh, please, please.
Let's put it together,

369
00:51:43,645 --> 00:51:50,235
just... make it round and let's go back
and forget about the whole thing.

370
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:52,404
We'll never talk about it again.

371
00:51:52,654 --> 00:51:57,492
Jesus, just being together is,
is enough!

372
00:51:57,701 --> 00:51:59,244
No, it's not, baby!

373
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:06,543
It takes pan, bread... money.

374
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:24,269
We need a room for the night
with a double bed.

375
00:52:24,603 --> 00:52:27,856
I'm sorry, sir, but this
hotel does not allow...

376
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:44,039
Now, listen...

377
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:48,585
Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin...
from Mexico City.

378
00:52:49,795 --> 00:52:51,839
And we're very, very tired.

379
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:59,429
And you pluck out one of those keys
while I sign the register.

380
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:05,435
Understand?
Understand?

381
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:17,406
Best room in the house, please.

382
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:31,230
I love you.

383
00:55:32,165 --> 00:55:33,417
Where are we?

384
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:38,130
We can ask for him at a place
they make furniture.

385
00:55:54,479 --> 00:55:56,023
That's it. There.

386
00:56:03,822 --> 00:56:05,616
-Buenos tardes.
-Yes.

387
00:56:38,315 --> 00:56:39,441
What's he say?

388
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:42,027
No luck.

389
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:46,573
Yeah?

390
00:56:48,033 --> 00:56:53,830
No luck at all.
I guess we came all the way for nothing.

391
00:56:54,998 --> 00:56:56,834
Lemme tell you something, baby,
