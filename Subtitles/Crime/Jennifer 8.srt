1
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:44,959
- You can drive down there.
- I´m aIready waIking. Where is it?

2
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:49,160
On the infiII.
A guy from LA just went down.

3
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:52,996
- What´s he doing here?
- He waited a whiIe for you,

4
00:03:53,127 --> 00:03:57,882
then decided to go and take a Iook
himseIf. Hope that´s OK.

5
00:03:58,007 --> 00:04:01,044
Damn right it´s OK.
With a bit of Iuck I´m going home.

6
00:04:02,927 --> 00:04:04,918
- What have we got?
- A dereIict.

7
00:04:05,047 --> 00:04:06,605
They cut his throat.

8
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:08,718
- Who are you?
- TrimbIe.

9
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:10,565
Where do you fit in?

10
00:04:10,687 --> 00:04:14,760
His father´s the manager. He was
shooting vermin and found the body.

11
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:19,915
Get ready, cos you´re in for a shock.
They sIit him from ear to ear.

12
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:25,280
- Do you want me to make a statement?
- Not right now. Thank you.

13
00:04:31,807 --> 00:04:34,196
- Did you bring it?
- Hope I´m not intruding.

14
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:36,761
Be my guest.
What have you got?

15
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:41,358
OId guy offed himseIf with a knife.
Can´t find the knife.

16
00:04:41,487 --> 00:04:43,079
They cut his throat.

17
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:47,645
Get behind the tape
and teII your father to put that fire out.

18
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:49,280
That ain´t IegaI.

19
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:55,238
- What wouId make him do that?
- Don´t annoy me, Travis.

20
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:58,757
- So where´s the knife?
- I don´t know.

21
00:04:58,887 --> 00:05:01,560
I guess that dozer must have shifted it.

22
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:03,996
You´re gonna need some hands
up here to Iook.

23
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,561
You heard Iook for the knife.

24
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:10,839
You, too, move that ass.

25
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:15,279
- You do the pockets.
- No, sir. I haven´t started tiII Monday.

26
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:19,205
I´m a tourist.

27
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:22,080
WeIcome to Eureka.

28
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:34,765
How Iong has he been feeIing Iike this?

29
00:05:34,887 --> 00:05:38,880
A week or two. Must have been
on kerosene. Stinks Iike a dieseI engine.

30
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,797
Mr BIattis of our IocaI newspaper.

31
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,924
- You sure it´s suicide?
- Yeah. It was weII rehearsed.

32
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,605
What does that mean?

33
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:51,605
Cut your own throat...
you´re nervous and you hesitate.

34
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:55,766
He´s got three triaI cuts, Iower Ieft side
of the neck before the big one.

35
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:58,606
Got a dead dog here, sergeant.

36
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:01,878
Find the knife!
VenabIes, has the coroner caIIed?

37
00:06:02,007 --> 00:06:03,645
Yes, sir. He´s deIayed.

38
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:06,445
AII right, I´m out of here.

39
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:08,922
I´II catch you Iater, Freddy T.

40
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:12,119
How does anyone
as dead as this Iose a knife?

41
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,282
What about that kid, Ross?

42
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:21,162
Shit. Of course, the kid.

43
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:26,836
Travis. Find that kid
and get the knife off him.

44
00:06:26,967 --> 00:06:29,686
He´s gonna Iie,
but he´s got it, so get it.

45
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:34,084
Get on with it.
What are you staring at?

46
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:38,359
- I think I´ve found something horribIe.
- What do you mean?

47
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:41,403
I think I´ve found a hand.

48
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:53,721
You´re right.
It´s a fucking hand.

49
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:12,678
What do you think?

50
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:17,517
I think you´ re here aII day.

51
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:32,276
How much Ionger are we here?
We ain´t gonna find anything eIse.

52
00:07:32,407 --> 00:07:35,843
Give it another hour.
Did the photographer do the dogs?

53
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:38,720
- Dogs?
- There´s two dogs.

54
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:40,644
He shouId do the dogs.

55
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:43,725
Got a brassiere here.
Looks Iike it couId be bIood.

56
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:46,236
- AII right I´m coming.
- Shit.

57
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:49,404
The coroner wants to know
if we can reIease the dereIict.

58
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:51,199
Yeah, he can go.

59
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:56,355
I think I´II Iay down with him.
It´s the onIy way I´m gonna get out of here.

60
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:58,876
It´s good to be with you, Ross.

61
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,322
GIad you finaIIy made it, bro.

62
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:23,635
- Want an umbreIIa?
- Yeah, thanks. Give me hand with this?

63
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:26,565
- Is this normaI?
- Pisses down October to June.

64
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:29,247
- How Iong have you known Freddy?
- Ross?

65
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:33,246
- He was my sergeant when I was a rookie.
- He got you the job?

66
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:36,359
He wouId have if he couId have.
He´s been trying Iong enough.

67
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:40,918
WeIcome aboard.
Caught the rain?

68
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:46,922
Sergeant Serato, TayIor and Travis I think
you know. I´II be with you in a minute.

69
00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:50,642
Do me a favour.
Bring the rest of the stuff out of the car.

70
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:53,440
Hey, Travis, don´t Iose it.

71
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,964
Find the knife, sergeant?

72
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:01,203
No, but we have a theory.

73
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:03,841
The kid toId me he didn´t take it.

74
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:06,356
Maybe he was Iying to you.

75
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:16,795
Is it true you found a hand?

76
00:09:19,487 --> 00:09:21,000
Is that it?

77
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,676
- Interview over, BIattis.
- Come on, chief.

78
00:09:24,807 --> 00:09:28,356
If it´s sensitive, just teII me.
I´m not taking notes.

79
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:32,958
We got a body part. We don´t know
what it is. ProbabIy hospitaI debris.

80
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:35,647
Now you know as much as we do.

81
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:38,361
- Was it maIe or femaIe?
- A woman´s hand.

82
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:40,125
I´m gratefuI for your candour.

83
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:44,320
Keep this out of the paper.
That dump serves a dozen communities.

84
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,519
We don´t know if it´s ours.
So don´t worry about it.

85
00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:50,286
- Was it frozen?
- Come on, get out.

86
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:54,605
This guy´s trying to move in.
Anything new, you´II be the first to know.

87
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:58,640
- Why did he ask if it was frozen?
- I couIdn´t teII you.

88
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:02,237
Don´t worry about any of this.
By the time you´re back it´s gone.

89
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:12,322
You scared me!
Look at you. You Iook good.

90
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:14,278
Do a rush on three pizzas.

91
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:16,841
Pizza? I haven´t seen him in year.

92
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:20,084
Dinner´s another night.
I´ve onIy got an hour.

93
00:10:20,207 --> 00:10:22,118
Bobby´s out.
What´s the rush?

94
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,000
Friday night at City HaII.
I got a chance to frighten the fat.

95
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:27,118
- Freddy´s new obsession.
- Who is who?

96
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:30,364
A bitch with an ass the size of Africa.

97
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:34,036
- So tonight she confesses?
- Tonight if you´re Iucky.

98
00:10:36,407 --> 00:10:40,002
- Not for me.
- I opened it for you. French champagne.

99
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:42,118
- It´s CaIifornian.
- Even better.

100
00:10:42,247 --> 00:10:45,239
- I´II have diet soda. I´m on a diet today.
- Since when do you drink diet soda?

101
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:50,395
Since he started Iooking so good.
Don´t pay attention to him. You Iook great.

102
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:52,836
- How´s your house?
- It´s OK.

103
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:55,959
- What does that mean?
- Not too good in dayIight.

104
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:59,636
Just shut your eyes tiII it´s painted.
You´II Iove it.

105
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,598
- This is God´s country.
- So I hear.

106
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:30,843
Hi. This is Mike BIattis, Eureka News.
I´m out of the office right now...

107
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:35,041
Can somebody drop these off for me?

108
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:38,125
- Sure. I´II take care of it.
- Thanks.

109
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:41,603
Are you winning, sergeant?

110
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:46,481
You know something about that hand?
I think it was frozen.

111
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:49,838
- Frozen?
- Yeah. What does that mean to you?

112
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:51,685
How you doing?

113
00:11:52,887 --> 00:11:55,082
Come on VenabIes, you´re a poIiceman.

114
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:57,801
A poIiceman aIways has an answer.

115
00:11:58,727 --> 00:12:00,638
- WeII, sir.
- WeII what?

116
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:03,839
We had a reaI bad murder
a coupIe of years ago.

117
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,880
Not in our county, but south of here.
A girI with no head and no hands.

118
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:10,965
You didn´t read about it?
It was big shit.

119
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:14,966
40 or 50 detectives were working on it
and never identified her.

120
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:17,396
Never found the head,
nor the hands.

121
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:22,078
CouId be a crazy guy kept the hand
in a freezer, and wants to get rid of it.

122
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:25,119
- Where´s the fiIe?
- In there if there´s anything.

123
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:29,035
It´II be under ´´John TayIor´´.
I beIieve the code is ´´Jennifer´´.

124
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:33,683
- Was it reaIIy frozen, sergeant?
- No. Been dead two weeks.

125
00:12:33,807 --> 00:12:36,719
Notice anything weird about it?

126
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:43,002
Look. One, two, three...four, five.

127
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:48,686
Six, seven, this Iong one, eight...

128
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:54,643
Nine, ten. I count 1 1 scars on this hand.
And there´s four more that might be scars.

129
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:57,600
Now, I count them on my hand. I have 5.

130
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,844
I´m 37 years oId. This girI´s about 1 8.

131
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:04,198
- How come she has so many scars?
- I don´t know.

132
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:06,283
That´s the question.

133
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:14,561
So. Why don´t you teII me about Jennifer?

134
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:16,837
You know I´m going to find out.

135
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:21,199
It´s an unsoIved. They spent about
$500,000 for a dead end.

136
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:25,639
- Check with TayIor. He worked the case.
- I did. What´s his probIem?

137
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:29,237
This. He thinks you stoIe his promotion.

138
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:35,602
- What exactIy are you doing there?
- It´s to quit smoking.

139
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:38,878
That´s interesting.
It must heIp with the withdrawaI.

140
00:13:39,007 --> 00:13:42,079
It´s a technique I read about.
Smoke 60 a day...

141
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:47,042
...throw one cigarette away, smoke 59.
Day two, throw two out, smoke 58.

142
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:50,762
- Why not just smoke none?
- It´s a rituaI. You got to do it.

143
00:13:50,887 --> 00:13:55,756
- Do you want my advice?
- Find yourseIf a farmer´s daughter

144
00:13:55,887 --> 00:13:57,559
with nice big tits

145
00:13:57,687 --> 00:14:01,043
and shake that bye-bye.
Send it to Sacramento.

146
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:02,486
I sniff grief.

147
00:14:09,847 --> 00:14:13,203
- You´re done except for the fIoor.
- Thanks. You´re a saint.

148
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:18,284
Don´t forget the wagon.
Bobby, heIp me with this.

149
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:22,195
- I´m dying.
- OK. Let´s go.

150
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:38,562
- AII right. I´m fucked.
- You´ve got to stop smoking.

151
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:46,520
- If I can do it, you can.
- How did you do it, oId man?

152
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:49,597
Somebody bet me a doIIar.

153
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:52,161
It´s not worth quitting for a doIIar.

154
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:54,881
AII right, I´II bet 50 doIIars.

155
00:14:56,887 --> 00:14:58,605
50 doIIars?

156
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:07,644
You got a bet.

157
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:12,636
JB, it´s Ronzo. You know that brassiere
you sent me? I got some resuIts.

158
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:17,841
First - the bIood is human, and it´s not a
popuIar brand. AB negative and that´s rare.

159
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:21,926
Two - the bIood on the brassiere is
compatibIe with the bIood from the hand.

160
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:27,599
And three - anything eIse, the answer
from aII us in Los AngeIes is ´´fuck off´´.

161
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,116
And shoot me a duck,
wouId you? Bye.

162
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:34,638
- What are you going to do now, soIdier?
- Dig up Jennifer.

163
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:44,319
- What is that?
- A Iaser enhancement of the fingertip.

164
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:48,201
It´s reaIIy bothering me.
You see these striations here?

165
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:51,956
It´s Iike she´s aIways worrying
the end of her finger.

166
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:56,526
Rubbing it...rubbing it...

167
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:59,798
rubbing it with her thumbnaiI or something.

168
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:05,923
AImost identicaI to Jennifer. SIim, white,
same age. Her bra size is even the same.

169
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:09,596
- NiceIy made Iady.
- How do you know her hair´s bIack?

170
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,161
The hair on her hand.
And Jennifer had bIack hair.

171
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,959
What´s with this Jennifer stuff?

172
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:16,601
- These cases aren´t connected.
- I think they may be.

173
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:19,446
I think Jennifer and this Iady
got hit by the same guy.

174
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:23,845
I have four points of positive
comparison on the cut.

175
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:27,801
That´s aII very interesting,
but where´s the body?

176
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:30,964
I don´t know much about this Jennifer
except what I´ve heard.

177
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:35,478
The principIe feature of the case
was a gruesome dispIay of the body.

178
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:40,078
So if this is the same guy,
why has he hidden this one?

179
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:44,086
Just wondered if you´d had time
to get around to my pharmacy stuff.

180
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:46,402
You´II have it in the morning.

181
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,595
I´II try again tomorrow. Chief.

182
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:54,686
You´re probabIy making him feeI
antsy with this back on the waII.

183
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:59,005
- I thought it was TayIor´s case.
- It sucked in officers aII over the county.

184
00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:02,324
It was the worst six months
this station ever had.

185
00:17:02,447 --> 00:17:06,156
Why don´t you give it a minute
and stop by my office? We shouId taIk.

186
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:11,236
- So what does he think it is?
- Everything it isn´t.

187
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:13,039
Make a Ieft.

188
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,681
He even tried seIf-infIicted.

189
00:17:15,807 --> 00:17:18,924
- It´s possibIe.
- Give me a break.

190
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:23,682
It´s the garage in the far corner.

191
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:33,321
- You can´t stop it can you?
- What?

192
00:17:33,447 --> 00:17:39,238
The worrying, the cIicking, the picking.
You might as weII be back in Los AngeIes.

193
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:44,165
Why don´t you dump it?
MaiI it off?

194
00:17:46,647 --> 00:17:49,445
Give it to the FBI...a present.

195
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:55,244
Stay here.
You might not be finished yet.

196
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:37,239
I just got an insane idea. If I´m wrong,
I´II redecorate the entire house.

197
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,881
She´s bIind. That´s why aII the scars.

198
00:18:40,007 --> 00:18:42,043
Here that traffic Iight?

199
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:44,123
That noise is for bIind peopIe.

200
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:47,319
That´s why she has marks
on her fingertips. She reads in BraiIIe.

201
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,041
Who´s next?

202
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:00,921
Amber Stone, 1 9 years oId,
Iast seen six weeks ago.

203
00:19:08,807 --> 00:19:12,004
- Is this the Iast one?
- One more to go.

204
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:16,441
WeIcome to Shasta Trinity Institute.

205
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:19,798
Reception is through the doubIe doors
and to your right.

206
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:24,443
- What exactIy is your interest in Amber?
- I´m afraid I can´t answer that.

207
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:28,355
As I expIained to your secretary,
we´re doing a Iot of Iooking.

208
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:31,047
We´re not even
sure it´s Amber we´re Iooking for.

209
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:35,206
And what do you hope I´II do?
Dissuade or persuade you?

210
00:19:35,327 --> 00:19:40,606
I was hoping you might remember
something to give us an idea where she is.

211
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:43,366
Then you couId have saved
yourseIf a Iot of driving.

212
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,524
What I said on the phone
is what I´m saying now.

213
00:19:46,647 --> 00:19:49,605
I have no idea where she is
or who took her there.

214
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:54,801
And, I might add, in five weeks,
1 50 students wiII be Ieaving here

215
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,886
for Christmas hoIidays with peopIe
whose names I won´t know either.

216
00:19:59,007 --> 00:20:01,202
Excuse me.

217
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:09,005
You have an appointment
with Miss Robertson?

218
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:12,403
ApparentIy she saw Amber
the weekend she Ieft,

219
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:15,644
and was briefIy in the room
with the man she Ieft with.

220
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:16,756
I see.

221
00:20:18,527 --> 00:20:21,405
She teaches another cIass at four o´ cIock.

222
00:20:21,527 --> 00:20:24,246
I´d appreciate it if you don´t detain her.

223
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:29,521
How come this pIace is so big?

224
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:31,683
Where is everyone?

225
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:35,959
I don´t know. He said this was
the staff side of the buiIding.

226
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:44,155
What did you think of that fucking idiot?

227
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:49,719
He had a handshake
Iike a partiaIIy excited penis.

228
00:20:52,047 --> 00:20:56,325
Hi. Sergeants John BerIin, Frederick Ross.
We have an appointment.

229
00:21:00,647 --> 00:21:05,004
What do you want to ask, Mr BerIin?
PIease sit down.

230
00:21:08,487 --> 00:21:12,275
I´d Iike you teII me, any way you Iike,

231
00:21:12,407 --> 00:21:15,683
what you can remember
about the time you spent with Amber...

232
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:18,037
...on the afternoon she Ieft.

233
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:21,125
WeII, I think I toId you on the phone...

234
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:25,920
I went up to her room to say goodbye...

235
00:21:26,047 --> 00:21:31,405
we sat on the bed and chatted whiIe
her friend was coIIecting her things.

236
00:21:31,527 --> 00:21:35,884
What kind of friend?
Boyfriend? OId friend? New friend?

237
00:21:36,007 --> 00:21:37,076
I don´t know.

238
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:40,165
Do you have any idea
what this friend was Iike?

239
00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:43,165
- Do you know how oId he was?
- No.

240
00:21:43,287 --> 00:21:49,283
Let me put it this way.
How oId do you think I am? 26, 39 or 53.

241
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:50,726
53.

242
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:56,123
You must have some idea.

243
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:58,761
When we spoke on the phone,
did you know I was bIonde?

244
00:21:58,887 --> 00:22:02,038
- No.
- Why not? You heard my voice.

245
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:06,240
We don´t have some sixth sense,
except in ridicuIous noveIs.

246
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:11,085
If I hadn´t known,
I wouId have thought he was bIind.

247
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:12,196
BIind? Why?

248
00:22:12,327 --> 00:22:16,286
Because he was comfortabIe with us.
He shook hands Iike bIind peopIe do.

249
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:19,285
- How´s that?
- BIind peopIe often use both hands.

250
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:21,602
- And he did that?
- Yes.

251
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:25,438
He used breath freshener.

252
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:29,840
I think his name was John.

253
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:32,925
You never mentioned that on the phone.
Why do you think that?

254
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:36,596
She must have caIIed him John.
I don´t know.

255
00:22:36,727 --> 00:22:41,278
I´m making some tea.
WouId you Iike some?

256
00:22:43,207 --> 00:22:44,560
Sure.

257
00:22:48,127 --> 00:22:51,722
- I think we got something here.
- We got a witness.

258
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:54,407
Give me some time.
She might remember something.

259
00:22:54,527 --> 00:23:00,523
She´s bIind. You´d be better off taIking
to one of these Beethoven guys here.

260
00:23:01,687 --> 00:23:03,279
This is crazy.

261
00:23:03,407 --> 00:23:06,524
Two hours here and back
and aII I got ´´John´´.

262
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:12,958
You said he spoke.
Can you remember what he said?

263
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:17,797
He just said, ´´Come on. Hurry up.
It´s starting to snow again.´´

264
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:23,444
He was breathIess from carrying the cases
because the eIevator had gone out.

265
00:23:24,087 --> 00:23:25,566
- It wasn´t working?
- No.

266
00:23:25,687 --> 00:23:28,440
It has a mind of its own.

267
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:30,842
Four o´ cIock pm.

268
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:33,720
- WeII.
- Can I see your hands?

269
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:36,758
- My hands?
- Yes.

270
00:23:42,247 --> 00:23:44,715
I have a cIass.
I have to go.

271
00:23:44,847 --> 00:23:48,044
Can you teII me anything eIse
about him or her?

272
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:51,045
- It doesn´t matter how smaII.
- No.

273
00:23:53,727 --> 00:23:55,604
Except he smoked Iike you.

274
00:23:57,367 --> 00:23:58,356
Me?

275
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:02,799
I couId smeII it on his breath
Iike I can smeII it on yours.

276
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:06,441
I have a cIass. I´m Iate.

277
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,244
Do you have a seeing eye dog?

278
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:14,356
No.

279
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:17,081
There´s Iots of scratch marks
on your door.

280
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:20,563
Sometimes I Iook after friends´ dogs
if they go to dances.

281
00:24:20,687 --> 00:24:23,963
Sergeant, can I just refer you
to this memo here?

282
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,521
- Did Amber have a dog?
- Yes.

283
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:29,719
- What coIour was it?
- I don´t know.

284
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:37,158
If she writes or caIIs or anything...
you´II Iet me know?

285
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:39,881
I´II Ieave a number with the office.

286
00:24:40,007 --> 00:24:42,760
50 fucking doIIars, OK?

287
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:49,405
What exactIy do you teach, HeIena?

288
00:24:49,527 --> 00:24:51,722
Music composition and ´ceIIo.

289
00:24:55,647 --> 00:24:58,525
50 of them and I want them now.

290
00:25:03,847 --> 00:25:06,600
You are now on the fourth fIoor.

291
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:22,124
Amber had a seeing eye dog
since she was 1 8.

292
00:25:22,247 --> 00:25:25,478
I knew that Iabrador
was too good to be dead.

293
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:30,727
- We´d better get back to that dump.
- No way. I´m not going back.

294
00:25:30,847 --> 00:25:34,078
You might find someone´s prick
in a hot dog roII.

295
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:35,435
We´re going.

296
00:25:58,567 --> 00:26:00,444
Get the Iight down here.

297
00:26:28,407 --> 00:26:32,685
In that bag you´II find a knife
and a pair of Iong-nosed pIiers.

298
00:27:05,447 --> 00:27:07,358
Looks Iike a 22.

299
00:27:48,247 --> 00:27:50,078
Jesus, he said six.

300
00:27:52,127 --> 00:27:54,641
I want you to see Citrine with me.

301
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:57,122
I know he´d Iisten to you.

302
00:27:57,247 --> 00:27:58,919
Listen to what?

303
00:27:59,047 --> 00:28:02,722
I want to take the BIind Institute to pieces.
Addresses, phone caIIs...

304
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:06,681
- everybody there from the Iast five years.
- For a dead dog?

305
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:11,801
We´ve got a major series here. This girI´s
not the second victim. She´s Jennifer Eight.

306
00:28:11,927 --> 00:28:14,839
I´m gonna see Citrine this afternoon.
WiII you come?

307
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:17,162
You´re not.
He´s out of town.

308
00:28:19,687 --> 00:28:21,325
You beIieve me, don´t you?

309
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:26,043
How does it matter what I beIieve?
You´ve got to worry what Citrine beIieves.

310
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:28,362
But I can´t heIp you with this.

311
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:31,045
I´m sorry, brother.

312
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:34,603
You´re on your own.

313
00:30:05,087 --> 00:30:06,759
Is anyone there?

314
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:09,476
Yes.

315
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:13,207
It´s John BerIin.

316
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:17,757
Have you been here Iong?

317
00:30:17,887 --> 00:30:20,355
Just a minute or two.

318
00:30:21,407 --> 00:30:23,682
I knocked on your door.

319
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:25,718
No one home.

320
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:28,524
So I foIIowed the music.

321
00:30:28,647 --> 00:30:30,126
I´m sorry.

322
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,283
Let me get my things.

323
00:30:33,407 --> 00:30:36,444
It´s not a probIem.
I´m not in a hurry.

324
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:48,726
As a matter of fact,
I saw a restaurant down the road.

325
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,566
I thought maybe we couId have Iunch.

326
00:31:03,287 --> 00:31:05,596
Was someone here with you?

327
00:31:06,087 --> 00:31:08,726
When I came in the door was fIapping.

328
00:31:10,647 --> 00:31:14,799
I don´t think so.
No one comes here at weekends.

329
00:31:14,927 --> 00:31:20,206
- I must be the worst witness you ever had.
- I admit you are one of them.

330
00:31:20,327 --> 00:31:23,797
I just wish I knew what vehicIe
you were taIking about.

331
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:29,877
Some cars sound fat, some sound thin.
This one sounded hoIIow.

332
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:33,318
Maybe it was a foreign car.

333
00:31:34,687 --> 00:31:36,757
Our kind of cars sound fat.

334
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:39,560
Are you sure you want to see it?

335
00:31:39,687 --> 00:31:42,201
It´s another three fIoors up.

336
00:31:42,327 --> 00:31:43,885
Yes.

337
00:31:47,487 --> 00:31:51,116
- How often does it break down.
- AII the time.

338
00:31:51,247 --> 00:31:55,365
They keep on threatening to fix it
but they never wiII.

339
00:32:05,887 --> 00:32:08,481
I sat right there on the bed.

340
00:32:17,607 --> 00:32:22,237
If I came to the diner with you,
wouId you bring me back?

341
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:24,835
Of course I wouId.

342
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:31,321
What are you staring at?

343
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:34,606
Sorry.

344
00:32:34,727 --> 00:32:36,399
It´s aII right.

345
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:43,079
It´s just you suddenIy reminded me of him.

346
00:32:43,207 --> 00:32:47,837
He was standing right where you are,
kind of breathIess Iike you.

347
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,526
I´II go and get my coat.

348
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:57,319
I´II wait for you downstairs.

349
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:10,127
I couIdn´t take another minute
of Los AngeIes.

350
00:33:10,247 --> 00:33:15,037
I feIt Iike I had to say sorry
in every street in the city.

351
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:22,124
I´II teII you what.

352
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:27,241
If I promise to stop being a cop,
wiII you stop being a witness?

353
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:32,077
I don´t have to ask aII the questions.
You can ask too.

354
00:33:32,207 --> 00:33:34,323
- Are you wearing a uniform?
- No.

355
00:33:37,487 --> 00:33:40,604
I´m gIad we got the conversationaI side
of Iunch over.

356
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:47,556
Sorry, just I don´t want to sit in a restaurant.
I feeI Iike everyone´s Iooking at me.

357
00:33:47,687 --> 00:33:50,201
Nobody´s Iooking at you.
HardIy anyone´s here.

358
00:33:50,327 --> 00:33:52,716
The onIy person Iooking at you is me.

359
00:33:56,207 --> 00:33:57,845
Are you married?

360
00:33:57,967 --> 00:34:00,959
Was. I don´t Iike to taIk about it.

361
00:34:01,087 --> 00:34:04,045
- You asked me to ask you questions.
- I know.

362
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:08,160
Just you picked the one time
I Iike not to remember.

363
00:34:08,287 --> 00:34:13,441
I was in the badIands, HeIena.
It happens to a Iot of cops.

364
00:34:15,527 --> 00:34:18,280
We don´t want to taIk about that.

365
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:23,117
´´Thoughts that Iie too deep for tears.´´

366
00:34:23,247 --> 00:34:25,886
Yeah, that´II do. Is that ´´HamIet´´?

367
00:34:26,007 --> 00:34:29,079
No, it´s Wordsworth.

368
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:34,876
Do you Iike poetry?

369
00:34:43,967 --> 00:34:46,401
Do you Iike poetry?

370
00:34:48,807 --> 00:34:51,685
I don´t know. I haven´t read much.

371
00:34:54,847 --> 00:34:57,520
I don´t think poetry´s my kind of thing.

372
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:02,958
- But you pray.
- Pray?

373
00:35:03,087 --> 00:35:05,965
You said you were in the badIands.

374
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:09,403
No, I don´t pray.

375
00:35:09,527 --> 00:35:12,280
I had a dream once about God.

376
00:35:13,847 --> 00:35:19,126
It was just about the time I was getting
weII, and he was a nasty Iooking guy.

377
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:21,636
He moved into the apartment right above.

378
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:26,845
And I said,
´´Don´t you Iisten to peopIe´s prayers?´´

379
00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:28,923
He said, ´´Prayers?´´

380
00:35:29,847 --> 00:35:32,919
´´Not often. They´re junk maiI.´´

381
00:35:35,127 --> 00:35:38,403
You´re pushing too hard.
It´s Iike you want me to say stop.

382
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:43,840
You must know it´s going that way.
We´ve got other cases so ease up a IittIe.

383
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,400
This is a major, chief.

384
00:35:45,527 --> 00:35:50,362
- We´re cIoser than ever to this guy.
- So where´s the body and why hide it?

385
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:54,560
He hasn´t. He never made a hit this far
north nor read a weather forecast.

386
00:35:54,687 --> 00:35:57,679
She´s probabIy 1 5 feet from the highway,
three feet under snow.

387
00:35:57,807 --> 00:35:59,160
Got a match on the buIIet?

388
00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:02,279
- Got a print from the hand?
- No, sir.

389
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:05,683
It couId be anyone´s hand.
IIIegaIIy disposed of hospitaI debris.

390
00:36:05,807 --> 00:36:09,516
It´s her hand and scars.
Her dog was shot and she´s missing.

391
00:36:09,647 --> 00:36:13,242
She´s not missing.
Did she scream? Did he coerce her?

392
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:15,198
No. She Ieft of her own free wiII.

393
00:36:15,327 --> 00:36:20,355
And if she gets on a pIane and goes to
Peru with the prick, she´s stiII not missing.

394
00:36:20,487 --> 00:36:23,957
I Iove to paint. It´s not great art,
but I switched the coIours.

395
00:36:24,087 --> 00:36:26,317
- If you´re not going to hear me...
- I have heard you.

396
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:28,756
You just don´t Iike hearing me.

397
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:34,757
You got this whoIe thing out of proportion.
I don´t know about Los AngeIes,

398
00:36:34,887 --> 00:36:37,196
but I don´t beIieve
there´s a poIice chief in the country

399
00:36:37,327 --> 00:36:39,557
who wouId put together
a task force for a body part.

400
00:36:39,687 --> 00:36:41,279
We have muItipIe homicide.

401
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,046
We have a body part
under suspicious circumstances.

402
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:47,762
A taiIor´s dummy wearing a brassiere
and a biII for $17 for its wig.

403
00:36:55,767 --> 00:36:59,362
You know the great joy of fishing?
You don´t have to think.

404
00:36:59,487 --> 00:37:02,763
Just you and the mackereI
and nothing in between but God.

405
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,447
I´m thinking about
the oId bum at the dump.

406
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:09,879
NaturaIIy, it´s a beautifuI day.
The sun´s coming out. Barbecue chicken.

407
00:37:10,007 --> 00:37:13,317
- What eIse wouId you be thinking about?
- He was murdered.

408
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:16,678
- He was aIso cremated.
- TeII me about it. I made a serious error.

409
00:37:16,807 --> 00:37:19,765
The guy who took him out
knew how to fake it.

410
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:21,240
Here they come.

411
00:37:23,847 --> 00:37:27,078
Throw it high in the air.
There you go.

412
00:37:27,207 --> 00:37:28,959
Why is she bIind?

413
00:37:29,927 --> 00:37:32,680
She had a car accident at 14.

414
00:37:33,367 --> 00:37:35,961
Her entire famiIy was wiped out.

415
00:37:38,327 --> 00:37:40,477
No shit.

416
00:37:47,327 --> 00:37:49,636
Such a shame.
She´s a reaIIy sweet kid.

417
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:53,885
She´s a doII,
but I wish he hadn´t brought her out here.

418
00:37:55,327 --> 00:37:59,286
RuIe one is,
don´t diddIe around with a witness.

419
00:37:59,407 --> 00:38:02,365
Except for the hair coIour,
she Iooks just Iike Suzanne.

420
00:38:02,487 --> 00:38:05,285
WeII, that´s who she is.

421
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:07,967
Except she can´t run away.

422
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:11,322
I reaIIy Iike Margie.

423
00:38:11,447 --> 00:38:13,915
She Iikes you.

424
00:38:14,047 --> 00:38:16,038
Have you known her Iong?

425
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:18,886
She´s my big IittIe sister.

426
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:21,157
She doesn´t sound Iike you.

427
00:38:21,287 --> 00:38:23,596
She kind of adopted me.

428
00:38:24,567 --> 00:38:26,558
How come you never asked me
what I´m Iike?

429
00:38:26,687 --> 00:38:28,359
I know what you´re Iike.

430
00:38:28,487 --> 00:38:31,160
How do you know what I´m Iike?

431
00:38:31,287 --> 00:38:35,485
- Ross toId me.
- Oh yeah? What did he say?

432
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:40,681
He said you were quite chubby
and you have a nervous tick.

433
00:38:40,807 --> 00:38:43,401
What eIse did he say?

434
00:38:43,527 --> 00:38:47,918
- Just your age.
- How oId did he say I was?

435
00:38:48,047 --> 00:38:49,924
57.

436
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:53,358
I don´t mind.

437
00:39:04,527 --> 00:39:08,406
- What´s the matter?
- That was Iike the hoIIow car.

438
00:39:08,527 --> 00:39:10,006
A VoIkswagen van.

439
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:12,759
Are you sure?

440
00:39:14,407 --> 00:39:16,557
Her dog was barking aII the time.

441
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:20,441
It didn´t Iike him.
He said, ´´Put that thing in the back.´´

442
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:24,276
Then I heard a door sIam,
and the van drove away.

443
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:27,283
Why were you out here?

444
00:39:28,807 --> 00:39:32,197
Because I wanted to feeI
the snow on my face.

445
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:37,716
I Iove the snow and the rain.

446
00:40:42,287 --> 00:40:44,801
What are you doing, Mister?

447
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:51,118
We´re having a Iot of vehicIe robberies.
Your door was open.

448
00:40:52,127 --> 00:40:55,517
- Can I see your driver´s Iicence?
-Yeah.

449
00:40:55,647 --> 00:40:58,480
I saw you Ieaving the Institute.
Do you go there a Iot?

450
00:40:58,607 --> 00:41:00,598
That was you who nearIy ran into me.

451
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:04,800
No, you nearIy ran into me.
Are you up there a Iot?

452
00:41:04,927 --> 00:41:09,045
My mother and I run an arts centre
and buy stuff from the institutes.

453
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:12,477
- Where´s your store?
- OakIand.

454
00:41:12,607 --> 00:41:14,165
OakIand.

455
00:41:14,287 --> 00:41:19,042
WeII, on your next stop,
make sure that door´s Iocked.

456
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:21,635
Merry Christmas.

457
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:25,077
Miss Robertson may appear mature,

458
00:41:25,207 --> 00:41:27,880
but Iet me assure you, she isn´t.

459
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:29,998
Not even by her own perceptions.

460
00:41:30,127 --> 00:41:33,517
If she couId Iook in a mirror,
she´d expect to see a chiId of 14.

461
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:37,845
I don´t wish to be indeIicate, Mr Citrine,

462
00:41:37,967 --> 00:41:41,357
but I think you understand what I´m saying.

463
00:41:42,327 --> 00:41:46,286
Investigation of a possibIe homicide
is never easy.

464
00:41:46,407 --> 00:41:51,720
And I hope you´re not suggesting
any impropriety on the part of my officer.

465
00:41:51,847 --> 00:41:57,604
Having said that, this department
has no further interest in Miss Robertson.

466
00:41:58,407 --> 00:42:00,557
Thank you for your cooperation.

467
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:02,484
I appreciate it.

468
00:42:05,527 --> 00:42:08,519
Just hear me out.
I have a vehicIe and a name.

469
00:42:08,647 --> 00:42:10,444
- What name?
- John.

470
00:42:10,567 --> 00:42:12,876
- What´s the vehicIe?
- A VoIkswagen van.

471
00:42:13,007 --> 00:42:16,124
You´II be knocking
on doors aII over the state.

472
00:42:16,247 --> 00:42:20,160
- Just give me a month.
- No. Finito, maestro. CIosed.

473
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:24,166
And this has nothing to do with him.
It was over anyway.

474
00:42:24,287 --> 00:42:27,324
I´m sorry.
I know this means something to you.

475
00:42:27,447 --> 00:42:31,838
I don´t want you at that institute again.
I´m fIat out about that.

476
00:42:33,247 --> 00:42:34,566
Here.

477
00:42:35,407 --> 00:42:37,398
Goodridge got it from Amber.

478
00:42:37,527 --> 00:42:40,166
It´s a postcard.

479
00:42:40,287 --> 00:42:44,360
ApparentIy she´s aIive and weII
and Iiving in OakIand.

480
00:42:44,487 --> 00:42:49,003
- She´s dead, chief.
- Then that´s a very unique souvenir.

481
00:42:52,847 --> 00:42:54,360
Can I buy you a beer, sergeant?

482
00:42:54,487 --> 00:42:58,480
Don´t try to ingratiate yourseIf with me,
Travis. But just this once I´II have a Mic.

483
00:42:58,607 --> 00:43:00,723
How are you doing?

484
00:43:00,847 --> 00:43:04,601
- Three Mics, Susie.
- A coupIe of shots.

485
00:43:08,527 --> 00:43:11,360
Look at those amazing bosoms.

486
00:43:12,447 --> 00:43:16,679
- Want another beer?
- No. Gotta go. I´m nights.

487
00:43:16,807 --> 00:43:19,640
- Give me a ride?
- Sure.

488
00:43:19,767 --> 00:43:22,156
How´s that hand job coming aIong, John?

489
00:43:22,287 --> 00:43:24,357
We´re not taIking the ´´taIk´´ tonight.

490
00:43:24,487 --> 00:43:26,637
No one´s gonna make that dude.

491
00:43:26,927 --> 00:43:31,478
Six months investigation and the nearest
we got, we thought he was a saiIor.

492
00:43:31,607 --> 00:43:33,723
- A saiIor?
- Yeah.

493
00:43:33,847 --> 00:43:37,806
In and out of Frisco on the big boats.
Every Iead pointed to the sea.

494
00:43:37,927 --> 00:43:39,645
Night Freddy T, John.

495
00:43:39,767 --> 00:43:41,803
How come he´s suddenIy so forthcoming?

496
00:43:41,927 --> 00:43:44,919
- I´d kick him in the fucking ass.
- Stop it.

497
00:43:45,047 --> 00:43:49,120
If he´d toId me, I might have got
somewhere. I never heard that theory.

498
00:43:49,247 --> 00:43:51,636
He might have
the one thing I need in his fiIes.

499
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:54,918
Have a fucking Iemonade.
Let it go.

500
00:45:18,527 --> 00:45:20,757
What are you Iooking for?

501
00:45:21,967 --> 00:45:23,878
VehicIe references.

502
00:45:25,687 --> 00:45:27,120
Wrong cabinet.

503
00:45:27,247 --> 00:45:31,081
I have a Iink with a series in San Diego
and haIf a VW van.

504
00:45:31,207 --> 00:45:33,323
I thought you might have the other piece.

505
00:45:34,207 --> 00:45:35,560
No.

506
00:45:36,807 --> 00:45:38,604
What´s happening?

507
00:45:38,727 --> 00:45:42,083
Sergeant BerIin is doing
a IittIe in-house investigation.

508
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:46,644
- I wish you´d fucking shout at me.
- You got some kind of obsession?

509
00:45:46,767 --> 00:45:49,759
Do the job you´re paid for.
There´s work right up the corridor.

510
00:45:49,887 --> 00:45:52,720
If our stuff´s too duII,
why don´t you go back to L.A.?

511
00:45:52,847 --> 00:45:54,963
I´m gonna be here when Jennifer 8 shows.

512
00:45:55,087 --> 00:45:59,000
In spring she´II come through the snow.
Then I´II find her kiIIer.

513
00:45:59,127 --> 00:46:00,606
Then I´II go back.

514
00:46:00,727 --> 00:46:04,766
When you finish in here,
I´ve got a report to type up.

515
00:46:07,207 --> 00:46:09,641
Maybe you´II Iet me know.

516
00:46:14,607 --> 00:46:18,520
You reaIIy are the working part
of an asshoIe, BerIin.

517
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:31,197
I didn´t intend to come today.

518
00:46:34,207 --> 00:46:36,038
I´m not supposed to be here.

519
00:46:38,007 --> 00:46:39,565
Why?

520
00:46:47,127 --> 00:46:49,038
It´s in BraiIIe.

521
00:46:51,167 --> 00:46:53,317
It´s from Amber?

522
00:46:55,047 --> 00:46:56,605
It´s dated a week ago.

523
00:46:58,287 --> 00:47:02,803
´´Dear Mr Goodridge, I´m sorry
I didn´t get a chance to say goodbye.

524
00:47:02,927 --> 00:47:04,997
´´Just a Iine to say aII is weII.

525
00:47:05,927 --> 00:47:08,839
´´I´m Iooking for a job
and an apartment.

526
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:12,804
´´Love to aII who Iove me. Amber.´´

527
00:47:14,527 --> 00:47:17,519
- I don´t think Amber wrote this.
- Why not?

528
00:47:17,647 --> 00:47:20,081
Amber wasn´t very good at BraiIIe.

529
00:47:20,207 --> 00:47:24,678
She couIdn´t have written it.
She couIdn´t even have read it.

530
00:50:44,367 --> 00:50:46,756
- You see this?
- What?

531
00:50:48,927 --> 00:50:51,157
You out of your mind with this?

532
00:50:51,287 --> 00:50:54,165
If anything happens to her,
I´II break your back.

533
00:50:54,287 --> 00:50:56,482
Easy on your words.

534
00:50:56,607 --> 00:50:58,086
What´s going on?

535
00:50:58,207 --> 00:51:01,643
His bIind friend got attacked.
AngeIo went up there.

536
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,725
- Somehow it got in the paper.
- You put it in.

537
00:51:04,847 --> 00:51:08,760
- I may have said something. I don´t recaII.
- Don´t Iie. I just spoke to BIattis.

538
00:51:08,887 --> 00:51:13,085
- You gave him the whoIe case.
- The case is cIosed. So what?

539
00:51:13,207 --> 00:51:15,926
You just hung a target
round her neck.

540
00:51:16,047 --> 00:51:17,241
BuIIshit, paI.

541
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:19,961
Don´t you know?
He coIIects newspaper cuttings.

542
00:51:20,087 --> 00:51:24,080
Now he´s reading HeIena Robertson´s
name Iike she´s a witness.

543
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:29,235
- You couIdn´t have been more stupid.
- Come on, Iet´s aII hear the expert.

544
00:51:29,367 --> 00:51:30,846
Just waIk away from me.

545
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:32,958
Think you´re the onIy guy
who´s worked homicide?

546
00:51:33,087 --> 00:51:36,079
I was a big city cop, too.
I busted the cIock on ´´Jennifer´´.

547
00:51:36,207 --> 00:51:38,767
I know more about this man
than you´II ever know. It ain´t him.

548
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,924
- You´re investigating a soap opera.
- Come on, stop.

549
00:51:42,047 --> 00:51:45,084
He says bye and she gets attacked.
Give me a break!

550
00:51:46,487 --> 00:51:51,561
There is no seriaI kiIIer. Put her name
in neon and there stiII isn´t one.

551
00:51:51,687 --> 00:51:54,599
Everybody here is saying it.
I mean everybody.

552
00:51:54,727 --> 00:51:57,844
- Shut up, King Jay.
- Let´s have this out.

553
00:51:57,967 --> 00:52:00,117
You know what everyone thinks?

554
00:52:00,247 --> 00:52:03,444
You´re making a case
because you found a nice piece of ass.

555
00:52:03,567 --> 00:52:06,957
No one´s bIaming you.
I hear she´s worth the fIowers.

556
00:52:07,087 --> 00:52:10,523
But don´t come in here
getting hoIy over us.

557
00:52:11,967 --> 00:52:16,199
Yeah, I put it in the paper.
Because I wanted to stop this buIIshit.

558
00:52:16,327 --> 00:52:19,637
- It´s pissing everyone off.
- You don´t know what you´ve done.

559
00:52:19,767 --> 00:52:25,239
If your friend from San Diego was here
and thought she was a danger to him,

560
00:52:25,367 --> 00:52:27,437
he wouId have taken her out weeks ago.

561
00:52:31,567 --> 00:52:34,365
Why don´t you get a dictionary
and Iook up ´´witness´´?

562
00:52:34,487 --> 00:52:36,921
- I know what a witness is.
- Yeah, weII, her it ain´t.

563
00:52:37,047 --> 00:52:39,641
That bitch is bIind as a bIind fucking...

564
00:52:39,767 --> 00:52:43,840
I´m gonna do something you never did.
I´m gonna catch this bastard.

565
00:52:43,967 --> 00:52:47,516
And when I do, he´II find out
how good a witness she reaIIy is.

566
00:52:48,527 --> 00:52:52,839
MeanwhiIe, you´d better be aware of me
because I wish you iII.

567
00:53:05,247 --> 00:53:09,957
I toId you what wouId happen
and it´s happened. ´´Goodbye, Princess.´´

568
00:53:10,087 --> 00:53:14,046
And that same night she gets attacked.
That´s a tough one to swaIIow.

569
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:16,522
I am famiIiar with TayIor´s opinion.

570
00:53:16,647 --> 00:53:20,925
- You don´t reaIIy beIieve this?
- 1 00 fucking per cent I beIieve it.

571
00:53:21,047 --> 00:53:24,517
You know why?
Because I never said goodbye. OK?

572
00:53:24,647 --> 00:53:28,003
- Is that good enough for the committee?
- I didn´t know that.

573
00:53:28,127 --> 00:53:29,685
No, you didn´t know that.

574
00:53:33,607 --> 00:53:35,598
You Ieft your booze in here.

575
00:53:38,647 --> 00:53:41,639
Who do you think it was?
You think it was him?

576
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:44,440
- That is a very stupid question.
- I´m asking it.

577
00:53:44,567 --> 00:53:48,719
How the heII do I know who.
Some jerk-off. Some peeping tom prick.

578
00:53:48,847 --> 00:53:50,838
DefiniteIy not him.
He´s in the trade.

579
00:53:50,967 --> 00:53:54,516
He won´t just Iook at her.
If he´s in a room with her, she´s dead.

580
00:53:54,647 --> 00:53:56,922
- Ease off.
- I´m sick of this toy town shit.

581
00:53:57,047 --> 00:53:59,481
What you´re saying is reasonabIe,

582
00:53:59,607 --> 00:54:01,996
but there´s a reasonabIe expIanation
for the opposite.

583
00:54:02,127 --> 00:54:04,038
Don´t give me another word of that.

584
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:08,365
There is a bad man out there.
He may be in the next room or next state.

585
00:54:08,487 --> 00:54:12,196
I don´t know what trigger´s him,
but if he reads her name in the paper,

586
00:54:12,327 --> 00:54:14,682
I think he´II do something about it.

587
00:54:15,527 --> 00:54:19,520
I got a bad feeIing about this. And I´ve
been doing this too Iong to be wrong.

588
00:54:39,887 --> 00:54:42,082
I don´t want you to worry, OK?

589
00:54:42,207 --> 00:54:45,517
We´re going to find this guy,
and everything wiII be OK.

590
00:54:46,247 --> 00:54:49,045
- OK?
- OK.

591
00:54:50,447 --> 00:54:52,756
You want your music on?

592
00:54:56,807 --> 00:54:59,241
You´re Iooking worried again, HeIena.

593
00:54:59,367 --> 00:55:00,880
No, I´m not.

594
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:04,716
You Iook more worried now
than when you decided to stop worrying.

595
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:09,120
I´II teII you what I´m going to do.

596
00:55:09,887 --> 00:55:13,641
I´m going to roast you a chicken
with candIes around it.

597
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,155
WouIdn´t it be better if I cook it?

598
00:55:18,647 --> 00:55:20,683
You said, you can onIy boiI.

599
00:57:38,967 --> 00:57:40,525
From HeIena.

600
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:44,157
Sounds Iike Frank Sinatra.

601
00:57:44,287 --> 00:57:47,597
- Where are the Iadies?
- Putting on the war paint.

602
00:57:48,567 --> 00:57:50,364
I can´t thank you enough.

603
00:57:50,487 --> 00:57:53,524
Don´t thank me, thank Margie.
It´s her invitation.

604
00:57:53,647 --> 00:57:56,241
And where Citrine is concerned,
we´II keep it that way.

605
00:57:56,367 --> 00:57:59,598
- Got ya.
- Chivas RegaI.

606
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:01,046
GentIemen...

607
00:58:05,447 --> 00:58:08,166
GentIemen, Merry Christmas.

608
00:58:09,727 --> 00:58:13,003
Now, turn around.
Let´s see the whoIe thing. Go on.

609
00:58:14,327 --> 00:58:16,522
You Iook so pretty.

610
00:58:16,967 --> 00:58:19,686
Once a year. Christmas.

611
00:58:19,807 --> 00:58:23,482
What do you think?
Not too much, just right?

612
00:58:23,607 --> 00:58:27,077
She Iooks so pretty.
WeII, say something, guys.

613
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:54,721
What?

614
00:58:57,087 --> 00:59:00,045
I got you. HoId my beer, sweetie.

615
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:01,441
CarefuI.

616
00:59:02,727 --> 00:59:04,843
Where the heII have you been?

617
00:59:04,967 --> 00:59:07,561
The duty sergeant fucked up.
I´m on tonight.

618
00:59:07,687 --> 00:59:10,406
- How Iong have you got?
- One big drink.

619
00:59:10,527 --> 00:59:12,279
- John, did you get my message?
- No.

620
00:59:12,407 --> 00:59:16,082
I Ieft a message on your machine.
It wasn´t me caIIing. Is my wife around?

621
00:59:16,207 --> 00:59:19,483
Kitchen. We got a so-caIIed
professionaI cook out there,

622
00:59:19,607 --> 00:59:21,962
having a nervous breakdown
over a turkey.

623
00:59:22,087 --> 00:59:23,520
Sure you didn´t caII?

624
00:59:23,647 --> 00:59:26,559
I spoke to what´s-his-name
but never asked for her.

625
00:59:26,687 --> 00:59:27,881
Her who?

626
00:59:28,007 --> 00:59:31,682
Someone´s been caIIing the Institute
wanting to ask HeIena more questions.

627
00:59:31,807 --> 00:59:33,126
Not guiIty.

628
00:59:34,247 --> 00:59:36,078
Thanks, AngeIo.

629
00:59:36,527 --> 00:59:38,085
You got a quiet phone?

630
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,323
Don´t start getting antsy
over this.

631
00:59:40,447 --> 00:59:43,519
- It´s probabIy some IocaI cops.
- It´s what I want to find out.

632
00:59:43,647 --> 00:59:44,762
Upstairs.

633
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:51,204
BeautifuI. There. Good.

634
00:59:51,327 --> 00:59:54,080
- Are you sure I Iook OK?
- Are you kidding?

635
00:59:54,207 --> 00:59:57,483
You are the prettiest girI
here by 200 per cent.

636
00:59:57,607 --> 00:59:59,438
Press your Iips together.

637
00:59:59,567 --> 01:00:02,161
There. Good. OK, sit down.

638
01:00:02,887 --> 01:00:07,722
- How are you doing on those heeIs?
- They don´t mix very weII with beer.

639
01:00:13,127 --> 01:00:15,561
When did John divorce?

640
01:00:15,687 --> 01:00:17,803
Two or three years ago.

641
01:00:19,287 --> 01:00:22,677
- What was she Iike?
- She was very pretty.

642
01:00:22,807 --> 01:00:27,403
But a poIiceman´s wife she wasn´t.
So one day she just packed and Ieft.

643
01:00:27,527 --> 01:00:30,837
And his whoIe Iife
went straight down the nearest toiIet.

644
01:00:30,967 --> 01:00:34,357
- What does that mean?
- It means, he crashed, you know?

645
01:00:34,487 --> 01:00:37,285
He just couIdn´t come to terms with it.

646
01:00:37,407 --> 01:00:41,559
Every spare minute he ran down to
San Diego, having a terribIe time with her,

647
01:00:41,687 --> 01:00:46,920
getting drunk, coming back... You wouIdn´t
beIieve the amount that man drank.

648
01:00:47,047 --> 01:00:51,120
- You think he stiII Ioves her?
- I think he stiII thinks about her.

649
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:52,839
Not Iike then.

650
01:00:53,807 --> 01:00:56,037
Then it was an obsession.

651
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:57,680
Yes, come in.

652
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:02,285
That woman in the kitchen says, if she
doesn´t get heIp, she´s going to resign.

653
01:01:02,407 --> 01:01:05,080
That woman, she´s a disaster.

654
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:07,641
OK, teII her I´II be right there.
No, wait a minute.

655
01:01:07,767 --> 01:01:12,522
Take HeIena with you and find John.
Don´t Iet go of her hand untiI you do. Good.

656
01:01:27,407 --> 01:01:30,479
I´II just see if he´s upstairs.
You stay right here.

657
01:01:35,647 --> 01:01:39,276
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

658
01:01:44,447 --> 01:01:47,644
- Hey, Popeye!
- Hey, Fat Guy!

659
01:01:47,767 --> 01:01:51,726
You are stiII
the prettiest goddamn cop in this town.

660
01:02:22,887 --> 01:02:24,366
It´s me, John.

661
01:02:39,567 --> 01:02:42,957
Do you want me
to bring Margie back up here?

662
01:02:43,087 --> 01:02:45,362
Take me home, pIease.

663
01:02:54,847 --> 01:02:57,805
I just can´t waIk in these shoes.

664
01:03:02,127 --> 01:03:04,595
You don´t have to dress Iike this for me.

665
01:04:37,687 --> 01:04:40,076
You can´t get in there.

666
01:04:40,207 --> 01:04:41,765
Jesus!

667
01:04:42,727 --> 01:04:46,322
- What are you doing?
- I suppose I´m drinking myseIf sober.

668
01:04:50,847 --> 01:04:56,205
- You got any GIasers?
- Yeah. Right drawer. Left drawer.

669
01:04:56,327 --> 01:04:58,045
- .32s?
- Right drawer.

670
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:06,122
- What exactIy are you doing?
- I´m going to the Institute.

671
01:05:06,247 --> 01:05:07,236
Now?

672
01:05:09,807 --> 01:05:13,846
This ´´cop´´ that´s been caIIing thinks
she´II be there over Christmas.

673
01:05:13,967 --> 01:05:17,198
I checked with the IocaIs
and our station. No caIIs.

674
01:05:18,407 --> 01:05:21,444
So whoever it is, it isn´t the poIice.

675
01:05:21,567 --> 01:05:24,035
This bastard´s
getting worried about something.

676
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:26,965
I think there´s a chance he might turn up.

677
01:05:27,087 --> 01:05:29,203
WeII, Iet´s hope he does.

678
01:05:34,767 --> 01:05:36,758
And if he does,

679
01:05:37,527 --> 01:05:40,200
I´m gonna drop a bomb on the fucker.

680
01:05:41,367 --> 01:05:42,482
Listen.

681
01:05:43,407 --> 01:05:45,284
You don´t have to come.

682
01:05:45,407 --> 01:05:49,286
Hey, watch ´em working.
I´m your partner.

683
01:06:10,207 --> 01:06:12,482
What time is it?

684
01:06:18,887 --> 01:06:20,798
Where´s your watch?

685
01:06:24,087 --> 01:06:26,317
I guess it´s by the bed.

686
01:06:30,087 --> 01:06:32,123
It´s 2:40.

687
01:06:35,807 --> 01:06:38,605
Isn´t she a IittIe young for you, bro?

688
01:06:42,007 --> 01:06:47,035
Do you think if she couId see, she´d
hang around with an oId dog Iike you?

689
01:06:47,247 --> 01:06:50,603
Your stomach´s going round
to meet itseIf behind your back.

690
01:06:50,727 --> 01:06:52,240
BuIIshit.

691
01:06:53,687 --> 01:06:57,475
- I´m in my prime, baby.
- Bits. Bits.

692
01:06:58,927 --> 01:07:00,724
What do you mean?

693
01:07:00,847 --> 01:07:03,600
PoIicemen´s bodies age at different rates.

694
01:07:03,727 --> 01:07:09,199
Look at me. My beIIy´s in its 50s, my baIIs
are in their 60s, and my feet in their 80s.

695
01:07:09,847 --> 01:07:11,838
Hit those wipers.

696
01:07:15,687 --> 01:07:18,155
There. See it?

697
01:07:22,607 --> 01:07:25,280
- See it, fourth fIoor?
- Yeah.

698
01:07:25,407 --> 01:07:27,443
He´s fucking in there.

699
01:07:27,567 --> 01:07:29,876
Let´s do it.

700
01:07:32,367 --> 01:07:34,358
- What channeI?
- LocaI.

701
01:07:34,487 --> 01:07:36,876
LocaI? What if we need back up?

702
01:07:37,007 --> 01:07:39,601
We´re not here.
I don´t want the desk to hear us.

703
01:07:39,727 --> 01:07:42,560
- You onIy got that .32?
- And my Beretta.

704
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,603
This fucking thing´s quitting.

705
01:08:01,727 --> 01:08:05,037
- I´II start at the top.
- You ain´t going aIone.

706
01:08:05,167 --> 01:08:07,442
That is a IiabiIity.
I don´t want you hanging on my shirt.

707
01:08:07,567 --> 01:08:11,958
If anybody comes down, take him out.
I want this bastard Iiving!

708
01:08:26,327 --> 01:08:28,443
- Ross.
- 1 0-2.

709
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:32,196
- I´m going in.
- You take care, bro.

710
01:09:05,167 --> 01:09:08,159
- Ross, you hear me?
- 1 0-2.

711
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:10,441
I´m going upstairs.

712
01:10:12,607 --> 01:10:14,996
John, what´s happening?

713
01:10:16,607 --> 01:10:20,600
I´m on HeIena´s fIoor
to take a Iook at her apartment.

714
01:10:22,647 --> 01:10:24,239
Are you OK?

715
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:27,396
My fIashIight´s kaput.

716
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:32,604
The door´s Iocked.

717
01:10:37,127 --> 01:10:39,516
What´s happening, brother?

718
01:10:41,087 --> 01:10:44,045
I hear something. Something upstairs.

719
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:46,965
I´ve got footsteps above me.

720
01:10:55,127 --> 01:10:57,277
John, what´s happening?

721
01:10:59,007 --> 01:11:02,682
- You are now on the third fIoor.
- Shit!

722
01:11:04,967 --> 01:11:07,322
The fucker´s in the eIevator.

723
01:11:13,927 --> 01:11:17,476
Get ready, Ross.
He may be coming down.

724
01:12:50,847 --> 01:12:52,246
John?

725
01:12:53,407 --> 01:12:55,523
Can you hear me?

726
01:12:55,647 --> 01:12:58,923
Can you hear me? Let´s go.
Can you hear me?

727
01:13:04,527 --> 01:13:05,676
Can you hear me?

728
01:13:06,727 --> 01:13:08,080
Can you hear me?

729
01:13:08,207 --> 01:13:10,482
Just be carefuI because I´m coming up.

730
01:13:14,407 --> 01:13:15,806
Is that you, John?

731
01:13:21,887 --> 01:13:23,002
John?

732
01:13:25,807 --> 01:13:30,164
Answer me. Now!
Or I´II bIow this fucking staircase to pieces.

733
01:13:31,087 --> 01:13:33,078
It´s me, Freddy.

734
01:13:34,247 --> 01:13:38,843
What the heII is going on up there?
I´ve been caIIing ten minutes.

735
01:13:38,967 --> 01:13:42,118
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

736
01:13:42,247 --> 01:13:44,203
What the fuck are you doing?

737
01:13:45,927 --> 01:13:50,398
HoIy shit, John.
John, not you! Not you!

738
01:14:30,927 --> 01:14:32,963
Get me the poIice. QuickIy!

739
01:15:31,567 --> 01:15:32,886
Where´s Margie?

740
01:15:36,247 --> 01:15:38,397
Taking Bobby to her friend´s.

741
01:15:38,527 --> 01:15:41,837
Thinks his dad´s in the hospitaI.

742
01:15:43,567 --> 01:15:45,876
Why did you go up there, John?

743
01:16:01,367 --> 01:16:02,595
John?

744
01:16:16,527 --> 01:16:18,165
Right here.

745
01:16:38,367 --> 01:16:40,278
Is that Margie?

746
01:16:40,967 --> 01:16:42,798
I´m here, darIing.

747
01:16:45,887 --> 01:16:47,878
I´m right here.

748
01:16:55,647 --> 01:16:57,877
Don´t cry, darIing.

749
01:16:58,007 --> 01:17:00,043
He was a big oId cop.
He didn´t Iike tears.

750
01:17:00,167 --> 01:17:02,158
- Margie...
- Don´t.

751
01:17:06,527 --> 01:17:07,516
Don´t.

752
01:17:16,127 --> 01:17:18,766
What are you going to do
about this, IittIe brother?

753
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:25,724
I don´t know, Margie.

754
01:17:25,847 --> 01:17:27,838
I don´t know.

755
01:17:32,927 --> 01:17:36,283
I´m tired now.
I´m going to go to sIeep.

756
01:17:42,487 --> 01:17:46,082
Let me go. Let me go.

757
01:17:47,127 --> 01:17:49,641
Let me go. Let me go.

758
01:17:57,607 --> 01:18:00,360
I want 24-hour protection
on Margie´s house.

759
01:18:01,527 --> 01:18:04,200
Otherwise I´m not saying nothing.

760
01:18:04,327 --> 01:18:07,603
You give me that,
or read my rights and taIk to a Iawyer.

761
01:18:07,727 --> 01:18:10,161
AII right. You got it.

762
01:18:10,287 --> 01:18:13,040
I´m going to put an observer
in there with you.

763
01:18:13,167 --> 01:18:15,806
- I don´t trust the F.B.I.
- I want Serato.

764
01:18:15,927 --> 01:18:18,441
- No.
- Why can´t I have Serato?

765
01:18:20,167 --> 01:18:22,283
Because I´m short of men.

766
01:18:23,567 --> 01:18:25,125
And AngeIo won´t do it.

767
01:18:26,087 --> 01:18:29,523
Whoever I got free first, you get.

768
01:18:34,047 --> 01:18:37,039
I aIways figured I´d Iike to retire
to a IittIe town Iike this.

769
01:18:37,167 --> 01:18:40,079
Maybe buy a boat, do some fishing.

770
01:18:40,207 --> 01:18:42,243
You fish, John?

771
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:45,157
I have done some.

772
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:48,199
AII right, Iet´s not beat around the bush,

773
01:18:48,327 --> 01:18:51,683
whatever that might mean,
and get right down to it.

774
01:18:53,887 --> 01:18:58,438
You don´t mind if I jump around a bit
whiIe I´m easing my way into this, do you?

775
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:02,082
- You´re asking the questions.
- You had an argument with Ross?

776
01:19:02,207 --> 01:19:06,598
- AssauIted one of the officers?
- I wouIdn´t use the word assauIt.

777
01:19:06,727 --> 01:19:09,878
- You got a racy temper?
- Not especiaIIy.

778
01:19:10,007 --> 01:19:12,475
Just something they did
made you Iose your rag?

779
01:19:12,607 --> 01:19:17,635
Not they. He. TayIor put a piece in the
paper, which put my witness in jeopardy.

780
01:19:17,767 --> 01:19:19,644
From whom?

781
01:19:20,207 --> 01:19:22,675
From the man I detaiIed in my report.

782
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:28,757
He´s a crazy man. And to my certain
knowIedge has kiIIed eight girIs.

783
01:19:30,847 --> 01:19:33,441
Not a Iot of support
for that scenario, though.

784
01:19:33,567 --> 01:19:35,523
No. Not a Iot.

785
01:19:35,647 --> 01:19:37,399
Not even from Ross?

786
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:41,516
No.

787
01:19:42,167 --> 01:19:44,920
Is that why you Iost your temper with him?

788
01:19:46,487 --> 01:19:50,844
Frustration. No one beIieving you.
Is that why you were angry with TayIor?

789
01:19:53,847 --> 01:19:56,919
- You don´t Iike Sergeant TayIor, do you?
- Like?

790
01:19:57,047 --> 01:20:00,596
- You want to use another word?
- I´m indifferent to him.

791
01:20:00,727 --> 01:20:04,276
You don´t bIame him
for the situation you´re in?

792
01:20:04,407 --> 01:20:08,923
His motive for exposing my witness
was maIicious.

793
01:20:09,887 --> 01:20:13,118
- So you don´t Iike him?
- No, I don´t Iike him.

794
01:20:15,127 --> 01:20:16,526
You...

795
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:20,121
...wish him iII?

796
01:20:26,247 --> 01:20:31,037
This crazy man, what makes you think
he wants to eIiminate Miss Robertson?

797
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:36,686
- Did you read my report, sir?
- I´m asking a question.

798
01:20:38,647 --> 01:20:43,596
He reads the newspaper. I´m
investigating her friend´s disappearance

799
01:20:43,727 --> 01:20:46,924
and Miss Robertson becomes
the focus of his anxiety.

800
01:20:47,047 --> 01:20:49,003
How good a witness is she?

801
01:20:49,127 --> 01:20:51,800
He´s a crazy man, but he ain´t stupid.

802
01:20:51,927 --> 01:20:55,124
He´s got a fIexibIe modus operandi
and doesn´t want to get caught.

803
01:20:55,247 --> 01:21:00,002
We´II have pIenty of time to discuss
your mystery man and his fIexibiIity Iater.

804
01:21:00,127 --> 01:21:02,721
Right now I´d Iike to taIk about the event.

805
01:21:08,567 --> 01:21:10,683
Can you turn that thing on?

806
01:21:10,807 --> 01:21:14,595
AII right, the door comes back,
hits you, knocks you out.

807
01:21:14,727 --> 01:21:18,402
For how Iong do you figure,
approximateIy?

808
01:21:18,527 --> 01:21:22,042
One minute? Ten?

809
01:21:22,167 --> 01:21:26,080
OK. Then what happened?
ImmediateIy you got up?

810
01:21:26,207 --> 01:21:29,085
I saw a fIashIight
at the bottom of the stairs.

811
01:21:29,207 --> 01:21:35,077
- Did you check your weapon?
- Maybe. It wouId have been instinctive.

812
01:21:35,207 --> 01:21:39,644
- AII I know is I was in possession of it.
- You didn´t check it?

813
01:21:39,767 --> 01:21:42,884
- I don´t know. I didn´t think of it.
- Why not?

814
01:21:43,007 --> 01:21:46,283
- I was dazed.
- You were confused?

815
01:21:46,407 --> 01:21:50,286
- I was unconscious ten seconds ago.
- I understand.

816
01:21:51,287 --> 01:21:52,686
Then?

817
01:21:56,527 --> 01:21:59,644
Then I grabbed the fIashIight.
I tried to get Ross on the radio.

818
01:21:59,767 --> 01:22:01,962
There was nothing. Static.

819
01:22:04,247 --> 01:22:06,681
I noticed bIood on my hand.

820
01:22:08,407 --> 01:22:11,922
- My eye was cut.
- CouId you see out of it?

821
01:22:12,047 --> 01:22:14,356
Yeah, I couId see.

822
01:22:16,767 --> 01:22:19,998
I cIimbed out of the window,
and went down the fire escape.

823
01:22:20,127 --> 01:22:23,563
When I got to the bottom, I found Ross.

824
01:22:24,847 --> 01:22:27,645
- Were you breathIess?
- Sure I was breathIess.

825
01:22:28,607 --> 01:22:32,520
When did you reaIise you were
no Ionger in possession of the .32?

826
01:22:34,127 --> 01:22:36,038
In the hospitaI.

827
01:22:36,167 --> 01:22:40,206
You figured you Iost it
in the hospitaI or on the way there?

828
01:22:40,327 --> 01:22:43,080
I figured it had faIIen down the stairweII.

829
01:22:43,207 --> 01:22:46,244
- Like the fIashIight?
- Yes.

830
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:55,200
Were you drinking that night?

831
01:23:00,967 --> 01:23:03,356
- It was Christmas Eve.
- That wasn´t my question.

832
01:23:03,487 --> 01:23:06,047
- Yes.
- What about Ross?

833
01:23:06,167 --> 01:23:11,446
Were you drinking in the car?
You had a bottIe in the car?

834
01:23:11,567 --> 01:23:15,037
- I think Ross had a mouthfuI.
- But not you?

835
01:23:15,167 --> 01:23:19,365
- I may have had a nip.
- To keep out the coId.

836
01:23:19,487 --> 01:23:23,275
It was very coId that night.
Wasn´t it very windy?

837
01:23:29,127 --> 01:23:32,836
- Which hand was the fIashIight in?
- Left hand.

838
01:23:34,127 --> 01:23:36,641
So the WaIther was in the right?

839
01:23:38,407 --> 01:23:41,046
- The Beretta was in the right.
- You said you didn´t check.

840
01:23:41,167 --> 01:23:43,727
So how do you know which gun you had?

841
01:23:43,847 --> 01:23:47,157
You said you thought it had
gone downstairs with the fIashIight,

842
01:23:47,287 --> 01:23:52,236
which you picked up in confusion. How do
you know you didn´t pick up the .32?

843
01:23:52,367 --> 01:23:55,279
- Are you pIaying games with me?
- Games?

844
01:23:55,407 --> 01:23:57,318
I toId you I Iost the WaIther.

845
01:23:57,447 --> 01:24:00,883
You said you didn´t know
untiI you were in the hospitaI.

846
01:24:01,007 --> 01:24:03,362
So it couId have been either weapon.

847
01:24:03,487 --> 01:24:06,797
The gun in my right hand was a Beretta.

848
01:24:06,927 --> 01:24:10,317
And I´d Iike that note corrected
for the record. Now, pIease sir...

849
01:24:11,407 --> 01:24:14,285
- Do you want a Iawyer?
- Another game question.

850
01:24:14,407 --> 01:24:17,843
What do I want a Iawyer for?
I got nothing to hide.

851
01:24:17,967 --> 01:24:21,482
- Don´t you?
- You know I don´t. So quit the buIIshit.

852
01:24:21,607 --> 01:24:23,882
Get down to it.
What´s your angIe?

853
01:24:33,287 --> 01:24:34,959
Where is that IittIe gun?

854
01:24:35,087 --> 01:24:37,476
- I have no idea.
- You don´t?

855
01:24:37,607 --> 01:24:40,644
If it isn´t at the Institute,
the man who kiIIed Ross took it.

856
01:24:40,767 --> 01:24:43,520
The man who kiIIed Ross used it.

857
01:24:46,487 --> 01:24:51,322
And you don´t have any idea where
that IittIe .32 caIibre WaIther´s gone?

858
01:24:56,247 --> 01:24:57,441
No.

859
01:25:18,567 --> 01:25:20,159
AII right, here it is.

860
01:25:20,287 --> 01:25:24,803
I intend to prove you shot
Frederick Ross with maIice aforethought.

861
01:25:24,927 --> 01:25:29,523
Therefore, I wiII be preparing
a case on behaIf of your chief

862
01:25:29,647 --> 01:25:32,605
to prosecute you for first degree murder.

863
01:25:38,447 --> 01:25:41,917
Dad! I want my dad!

864
01:25:42,047 --> 01:25:44,800
I hate her! I hate her!

865
01:26:18,727 --> 01:26:21,685
CouId I have a number of a taxi, pIease?

866
01:26:21,807 --> 01:26:26,323
There was a gaIe that night.
AII the doors were swinging.

867
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:31,237
So this door comes back,
cIips you, and down you go.

868
01:26:31,367 --> 01:26:35,758
Within 35 seconds of unconsciousness,
you were on the fire escape.

869
01:26:35,887 --> 01:26:37,878
And you´re reaIIy confused.

870
01:26:38,007 --> 01:26:41,602
You don´t know if Tuesdays come in twos
or happen once a week.

871
01:26:41,727 --> 01:26:44,116
You see a figure coming up the stairs.

872
01:26:44,247 --> 01:26:48,286
Ross isn´t meant to be on the stairs.
He chaIIenges you.

873
01:26:49,207 --> 01:26:51,767
And this ain´t a piece of wood
with a naiI through it.

874
01:26:51,887 --> 01:26:55,846
This guy´s got a 12-gauge Winchester
up your nose, and he´s drunk.

875
01:26:55,967 --> 01:26:58,879
You´re dizzy, and your eye´s fuII of bIood.

876
01:26:59,007 --> 01:27:01,726
You ain´t thinking good,
and you´re seeing worse.

877
01:27:01,847 --> 01:27:05,760
And...wow...it just went off.

878
01:27:06,727 --> 01:27:09,799
You just put him down.

879
01:27:11,407 --> 01:27:14,638
And you get hit by a GIaser,
you stay down.

880
01:27:15,447 --> 01:27:20,885
But he ain´t dead.
Now you reaIise, you shot your partner.

881
01:27:22,567 --> 01:27:26,526
´´Oh, Suzanna,
how am I going to get out of this one?´´

882
01:27:29,927 --> 01:27:31,406
I know.

883
01:27:31,527 --> 01:27:35,042
SeriaI kiIIer shot him.

884
01:27:39,527 --> 01:27:41,483
And now...

885
01:27:42,687 --> 01:27:45,155
...here comes the maIice, bro.

886
01:27:47,687 --> 01:27:53,319
17 seconds Iater,
you put another one in his throat.

887
01:27:55,487 --> 01:27:57,637
Isn´t that what happened?

888
01:27:57,767 --> 01:27:58,961
No.

889
01:28:00,047 --> 01:28:01,639
TeII me what happened then.

890
01:28:56,407 --> 01:28:58,637
Let me ask you a question,
before I forget.

891
01:28:58,767 --> 01:29:01,327
- Do you take medication for that?
- For what?

892
01:29:01,447 --> 01:29:04,166
- BreathIessness.
- No.

893
01:29:10,567 --> 01:29:14,355
Let me answer your question:
´´What is the reIevance of the janitor?´´

894
01:29:20,367 --> 01:29:24,883
Why don´t I take you through it
from where I´m sitting?

895
01:29:25,007 --> 01:29:27,885
At some time between 2:00 and 2:30,

896
01:29:28,007 --> 01:29:31,966
the janitor thought he heard
a vehicIe approaching through the woods.

897
01:29:32,087 --> 01:29:36,046
He Iooks out, sees nothing.
No Iights, nothing.

898
01:29:37,807 --> 01:29:39,957
He figures it must be hunters.

899
01:29:40,087 --> 01:29:43,159
Some time Iater, he hears a noise.

900
01:29:43,287 --> 01:29:46,245
A door. Maybe a window sIam.

901
01:29:46,367 --> 01:29:51,395
He gets up, and between 2:30 and 2:45

902
01:29:51,527 --> 01:29:56,476
he makes a search with a fIashIight
of the top three fIoors.

903
01:29:57,967 --> 01:30:02,518
Finding nothing untoward,
he goes back to his apartment on the roof.

904
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:06,037
The fIashIight you saw was his.

905
01:30:06,167 --> 01:30:09,443
The footsteps you heard were his.

906
01:30:09,567 --> 01:30:13,082
The eIevator you were chasing
up and down was empty.

907
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:18,042
It´s prone to such activity
due to an eIectricaI fauIt.

908
01:30:18,167 --> 01:30:21,716
ApparentIy it happens
frequentIy during gaIes.

909
01:30:21,847 --> 01:30:24,566
The gaIe that was swinging the door,

910
01:30:24,687 --> 01:30:28,805
knocked you down
and confused you so much.

911
01:30:28,927 --> 01:30:32,363
And so here we are
back to where I´m sitting.

912
01:30:34,567 --> 01:30:38,082
Why don´t you teII me
what reaIIy went on that night?

913
01:30:40,727 --> 01:30:43,924
There are two men
that know I didn´t kiII him.

914
01:30:45,287 --> 01:30:48,165
One is me,
and the other is the man that did.

915
01:30:48,287 --> 01:30:54,044
Which man is this?
We just deaIt with the man.

916
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:43,084
John, is that you?

917
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:09,205
You got reaIIy fucking Iucky,
didn´t you?

918
01:33:13,367 --> 01:33:15,164
FeeI my face.

919
01:33:23,607 --> 01:33:26,997
I was starting to get
kind of concerned about you, Jenny.

920
01:33:28,287 --> 01:33:31,962
Like, how bIind are you?

921
01:33:32,087 --> 01:33:34,999
As bIind as your friend,

922
01:33:35,127 --> 01:33:38,756
or Iess bIind,
because she couId see, you know.

923
01:33:38,887 --> 01:33:41,924
She had a view out of one of them.

924
01:33:42,527 --> 01:33:44,279
But you...

925
01:33:44,407 --> 01:33:47,638
you don´t see nothing, do you?

926
01:33:47,767 --> 01:33:49,678
Nothing at aII.

927
01:33:49,807 --> 01:33:54,483
But Iet me teII you, IittIe Jenny.
If he ever gets to me, you´re dead.

928
01:33:54,607 --> 01:33:56,120
That´s a promise.

929
01:33:58,927 --> 01:34:02,124
Get St. Anne in here
for a minute, wiII you?

930
01:34:02,247 --> 01:34:06,798
Give him this.
Our bIind Iady has been attacked again.

931
01:34:06,927 --> 01:34:09,122
She´s in Iove with him.
She´II try anything.

932
01:34:09,247 --> 01:34:10,646
Yeah.

933
01:34:11,087 --> 01:34:13,476
I hear I´ve been nominated
as an officiaI observer.

934
01:34:13,607 --> 01:34:16,041
- It´s either you or TayIor.
- He don´t want to do it either.

935
01:34:16,167 --> 01:34:18,920
I´II toss a coin,
but one of you is going in there today.

936
01:34:19,047 --> 01:34:21,686
BuIIshit or not,
you shouId get a proper statement.

937
01:34:21,807 --> 01:34:26,164
That´s been done.
What do you want to do with it?

938
01:34:28,887 --> 01:34:30,320
Let him have it.

939
01:34:52,967 --> 01:34:55,435
I need a friend, AngeIo.

940
01:34:55,567 --> 01:34:57,444
You got one.

941
01:35:03,087 --> 01:35:05,203
She´s a bad witness, John.

942
01:35:05,327 --> 01:35:07,443
And a fucking Iousy aIibi.

943
01:35:20,727 --> 01:35:24,402
I know why you did it, HeIena,
but you´re not heIping me.

944
01:35:25,327 --> 01:35:28,125
Everything they are hearing from me
they think is a Iie.

945
01:35:28,767 --> 01:35:32,555
Here comes the man
who I´m desperate to prove exists

946
01:35:32,687 --> 01:35:36,680
and what do you know,
he turns up at my house to chat with you!

947
01:35:36,807 --> 01:35:41,358
Nobody in CaIifornia is going
to beIieve that. No one beIieves me.

948
01:35:41,487 --> 01:35:45,400
- I don´t beIieve me.
- Don´t you dare say that! I beIieve you.

949
01:35:45,527 --> 01:35:50,123
- You just don´t understand.
- Then expIain it to me.

950
01:35:50,247 --> 01:35:52,920
I´ve got enough darkness, haven´t I?

951
01:35:54,367 --> 01:35:57,598
The man who kiIIed Amber
is a psychopath.

952
01:35:57,727 --> 01:35:59,718
He was in the Institute to kiII you.

953
01:35:59,847 --> 01:36:03,840
He didn´t want to kiII Ross,
he was there to kiII you. That´s the truth.

954
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:07,596
That´s why I wanted you to stay
in Margie´s house.

955
01:36:07,727 --> 01:36:10,366
I can no Ionger protect you here.

956
01:36:12,327 --> 01:36:15,000
- Why me?
- He thinks you´re a witness.

957
01:36:15,127 --> 01:36:17,800
- Then why didn´t he kiII me?
- Stop it, pIease.

958
01:36:17,927 --> 01:36:22,318
- Why didn´t he kiII me, John?
- Stop that! I´m not Serato, HeIena!

959
01:36:30,607 --> 01:36:33,041
He didn´t kiII you
because he wasn´t here.

960
01:36:33,167 --> 01:36:36,159
He won´t stay in the same room
with you and Iet you Iive.

961
01:36:36,287 --> 01:36:38,596
Kiss me, John.

962
01:36:47,007 --> 01:36:49,043
Kiss me again.

963
01:36:55,167 --> 01:36:58,125
I Iove you.
Are my Iips Iying to you?

964
01:36:58,247 --> 01:37:00,556
Is my mouth Iying to you?

965
01:37:04,167 --> 01:37:05,805
He was here.

966
01:37:10,927 --> 01:37:13,043
I´ve been caIIing ten minutes.

967
01:37:13,167 --> 01:37:15,920
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

968
01:37:16,047 --> 01:37:19,642
What the fuck are you doing?

969
01:37:19,767 --> 01:37:22,839
HoIy shit, John!
John, not you!

970
01:37:32,647 --> 01:37:38,005
Ross switched in to channeI 8, so we
have a recording of the whoIe incident.

971
01:37:40,567 --> 01:37:44,719
John, I couId heIp you.
Why don´t you teII me the truth?

972
01:37:44,847 --> 01:37:46,121
I have.

973
01:37:47,407 --> 01:37:50,604
That isn´t me.
I´ve never caIIed Ross ´´Freddy´´.

974
01:37:50,727 --> 01:37:53,287
- I´ve heard you caII him ´´Freddy´´.
- No you haven´t.

975
01:37:53,407 --> 01:37:55,875
You have no voice in here,
so keep your mouth shut.

976
01:37:56,007 --> 01:38:00,364
You teII a Iot of Iies. Is it something
that comes naturaIIy to you?

977
01:38:00,487 --> 01:38:04,082
- I don´t Iie.
- You´d Iie to your chief?

978
01:38:04,207 --> 01:38:09,884
- Under exceptionaI circumstances.
- What caused you to Iie to Freddy Ross?

979
01:38:10,007 --> 01:38:11,679
I´ve never Iied to Ross.

980
01:38:11,807 --> 01:38:13,399
- You didn´t?
- No.

981
01:38:14,447 --> 01:38:16,722
WeII, he thought you did.

982
01:38:16,847 --> 01:38:19,725
He even wrote it down here in his book.

983
01:38:21,367 --> 01:38:23,756
´´BerIin is a Iiar.´´
It´s underIined.

984
01:38:23,887 --> 01:38:28,722
It´s dated the day you got your first break
with your mystery man.

985
01:38:28,847 --> 01:38:31,759
You don´t know why he wrote that, do you?

986
01:38:35,327 --> 01:38:38,205
Maybe he thought
there was no mystery man.

987
01:38:38,327 --> 01:38:41,285
Maybe he thought
your investigation was buIIshit.

988
01:38:41,407 --> 01:38:46,561
Maybe he thought you were making it up
because you wanted to be top cop.

989
01:38:47,767 --> 01:38:51,282
Isn´t that why
you ran up that garbage dump -

990
01:38:51,407 --> 01:38:54,843
so everyone couId stand in awe of top cop!

991
01:38:57,607 --> 01:39:00,883
You came up here
cos you couIdn´t make it in LA.

992
01:39:01,007 --> 01:39:05,364
You got a pissy IittIe degree
and came here to be top guy. Right?

993
01:39:05,487 --> 01:39:10,481
But Ross was top guy, wasn´t he?
AIways wouId be top guy.

994
01:39:10,607 --> 01:39:13,121
And he did it without even trying!

995
01:39:13,247 --> 01:39:15,442
Everybody Ioved him.

996
01:39:15,567 --> 01:39:18,286
He had everything you wanted, didn´t he?

997
01:39:18,407 --> 01:39:22,400
Great marriage. Great kid.
Everything that you couIdn´t have.

998
01:39:22,527 --> 01:39:25,200
And you wanted it aII to go away.

999
01:39:26,007 --> 01:39:28,680
Cos you had a Iousy Iife

1000
01:39:28,807 --> 01:39:33,164
with a Iousy wife
who was fucking everyone.

1001
01:39:33,287 --> 01:39:35,039
Wasn´t she?

1002
01:39:35,167 --> 01:39:39,240
Is that why you needed
to pick on this IittIe bIind girI?

1003
01:39:39,367 --> 01:39:43,246
Cos you couId controI her.
ControI who she´s fucking...

1004
01:39:45,927 --> 01:39:52,002
Come on, John. Lose your temper with
me. You´re good at Iosing your temper.

1005
01:39:52,127 --> 01:39:57,440
- Come on, Iose your temper with me.
- No way, Mr St. Anne.

1006
01:39:59,847 --> 01:40:03,078
But you Iost your temper with Ross,
didn´t you?

1007
01:40:03,207 --> 01:40:05,880
Why don´t you teII me the truth?

1008
01:40:06,967 --> 01:40:09,959
You got into an argument in the car.

1009
01:40:10,087 --> 01:40:12,885
You Iost your temper with him.

1010
01:40:13,007 --> 01:40:17,717
You stood over him and bIew
his fucking Iarynx out with a GIaser!

1011
01:40:17,847 --> 01:40:21,203
Where were you aiming, John?
Going for the face?

1012
01:40:21,327 --> 01:40:25,366
You wanted to bIow his fucking face away
because you hated him so much?

1013
01:40:25,487 --> 01:40:29,526
No, I Iove that guy. It´s tough knowing
that he thought I kiIIed him.

1014
01:40:29,647 --> 01:40:33,560
WeII, that he did.
And that do I, sergeant.

1015
01:40:46,767 --> 01:40:49,600
What do you take
for that breathIessness?

1016
01:40:49,727 --> 01:40:53,436
- I don´t take anything.
- How about AminophyIIine?

1017
01:40:55,367 --> 01:40:58,165
- I don´t know what that is.
- You don´t?

1018
01:40:58,287 --> 01:41:00,596
It´s an anti-asthma medication...

1019
01:41:00,727 --> 01:41:03,036
...prescribed for breathIessness.

1020
01:41:03,927 --> 01:41:06,600
It came out of the ashtray of your car.

1021
01:41:07,727 --> 01:41:10,002
But you don´t know what it is.

1022
01:41:10,127 --> 01:41:15,520
You know how it got there?
You don´t use it for breathIessness?

1023
01:41:21,527 --> 01:41:24,246
John, I´m running out of questions...

1024
01:41:24,367 --> 01:41:26,961
and you´re running out of Iies.

1025
01:41:27,087 --> 01:41:30,159
You´ve one more chance
to take that second degree.

1026
01:41:48,807 --> 01:41:51,799
- I´m gonna need some time to think.
- AII right.

1027
01:41:51,927 --> 01:41:55,203
You think about it.
But don´t make a fooI of me.

1028
01:41:55,847 --> 01:42:01,080
You come back with another Iie,
I´II press for the maximum penaIty there is.

1029
01:42:01,687 --> 01:42:03,723
That´s the death penaIty.

1030
01:42:06,567 --> 01:42:08,683
Come on, get your things. Let´s go.

1031
01:42:08,807 --> 01:42:11,196
The man who murdered Ross
gets asthma.

1032
01:42:11,327 --> 01:42:15,240
It´s not breath freshener,
it´s an asthma inhaIer.

1033
01:42:15,367 --> 01:42:19,804
This capsuIe came out of the van.
This guy drove that van.

1034
01:42:19,927 --> 01:42:22,521
- OK. OakIand. What?
- Arts and Crafts.

1035
01:42:22,647 --> 01:42:25,115
Dan. Yeah. Here.

1036
01:42:26,327 --> 01:42:28,158
You sure?

1037
01:42:28,287 --> 01:42:31,643
- No Amanda with a VW.
- Arts and Crafts.

1038
01:42:31,767 --> 01:42:33,246
I gotta find that store.

1039
01:42:43,567 --> 01:42:46,320
If you find him,
caII me with his name.

1040
01:47:15,527 --> 01:47:18,280
The time is 9:00 pm.

1041
01:49:16,447 --> 01:49:19,962
You shouId not have come
to my mother´s house.

1042
01:49:21,327 --> 01:49:24,763
PoIice spent severaI hours this morning
at Sergeant BerIin´s home.

1043
01:49:24,887 --> 01:49:28,436
Various property was removed
incIuding a .32 caIibre WaIther pistoI -

1044
01:49:28,567 --> 01:49:32,606
the weapon beIieved to have been used
in the sIaying of Sergeant Ross.

1045
01:49:32,727 --> 01:49:35,525
I´m unabIe to say anything right now

1046
01:49:35,647 --> 01:49:38,559
except this is a very sad and tragic day.

1047
01:49:38,687 --> 01:49:44,125
John BerIin Iied to me and, much worse,
he Iied to everyone in this community.

1048
01:49:44,247 --> 01:49:47,717
- Where was Sergeant BerIin arrested?
- At his home. 6:00 am.

1049
01:49:47,847 --> 01:49:50,725
- Who arrested him?
- Sergeant TayIor.

1050
01:49:50,847 --> 01:49:53,759
- Did he resist arrest?
- I´ve nothing to add.

1051
01:49:53,887 --> 01:49:57,163
He did not arrest me in my house!

1052
01:49:57,287 --> 01:50:00,597
He hit on me in OakIand.

1053
01:50:00,727 --> 01:50:03,195
I´II sign anything you want. Anything!

1054
01:50:03,327 --> 01:50:07,206
I just want an opportunity
to taIk to her and Margie, that´s aII.

1055
01:50:07,327 --> 01:50:09,921
That´s my deaI, chief.

1056
01:50:10,047 --> 01:50:13,801
- AII right, I´II put it to St. Anne.
- Be quick, or she´s dead.

1057
01:50:13,927 --> 01:50:17,078
He didn´t push her down the stairs
when they met, did he?

1058
01:50:17,207 --> 01:50:20,756
He went up there to pIant the fucking gun!

1059
01:50:23,487 --> 01:50:26,718
Open the door, Travis!

1060
01:51:29,727 --> 01:51:32,036
- Margie?
- It´s Sergeant TayIor.

1061
01:51:32,167 --> 01:51:36,319
I´m sorry, Margie.
I´ve been trying to caII. Your Iine´s down.

1062
01:51:36,447 --> 01:51:39,120
We´re taking the guard off today.

1063
01:51:43,087 --> 01:51:45,965
Is she going somewhere?

1064
01:51:46,807 --> 01:51:49,560
You´re not going to try
and baiI him, are you?

1065
01:51:49,687 --> 01:51:52,804
I reaIIy wouIdn´t do that, Margie.
We found the gun.

1066
01:51:54,567 --> 01:51:56,398
I know.

1067
01:52:04,527 --> 01:52:08,236
Do you want me to drive her?
I´m through with my shift.

1068
01:52:08,367 --> 01:52:10,927
No. I´m going to take her.

1069
01:52:16,047 --> 01:52:18,766
I´ve got your suitcase.

1070
01:52:20,447 --> 01:52:22,677
Here´s my arm.

1071
01:52:32,207 --> 01:52:37,281
TayIor was a cop in San Diego.
He comes up here, hits another girI,

1072
01:52:37,407 --> 01:52:40,922
then spends months
feeding faIse information into ´´Jennifer´´.

1073
01:52:41,487 --> 01:52:45,162
Let me teII you about this sick man
named John TayIor.

1074
01:52:45,287 --> 01:52:48,359
He grows up
in an environment of bIind chiIdren.

1075
01:52:48,487 --> 01:52:53,925
His mother is bIind, she teaches the bIind
and he has cIasses with bIind girIs.

1076
01:52:54,047 --> 01:52:58,563
He´s a boy, so he´s attracted to them.
But every time he smiIes at them...

1077
01:52:58,687 --> 01:53:01,281
He reaIIy don´t Iike you, JK!

1078
01:53:01,407 --> 01:53:06,083
...they reject him
and his fantasies deveIop into a rage.

1079
01:53:07,167 --> 01:53:11,160
He´s gonna dig himseIf in some buIIshit
with this buIIshit.

1080
01:53:11,287 --> 01:53:15,917
Therefore he hates them. What is he
going to do with those Iousy bitches?

1081
01:53:16,527 --> 01:53:19,519
He´s a IittIe boy.
He turns them into IittIe doIIs...

1082
01:53:19,647 --> 01:53:23,401
He tears their heads and hands off
and puts them on his face.

1083
01:53:23,527 --> 01:53:25,677
He reaIIy didn´t Iike me!

1084
01:53:27,847 --> 01:53:29,838
- He´s out.
- What?

1085
01:53:29,967 --> 01:53:31,525
Margie just made his baiI.

1086
01:53:47,967 --> 01:53:51,403
There´s no one here.
Mom took her back to the Institute.

1087
01:53:51,527 --> 01:53:54,200
- What? When?
- I don´t know.

1088
01:53:54,327 --> 01:53:56,477
How come they Iet you out?

1089
01:53:57,407 --> 01:53:59,637
Is Margie with her?

1090
01:54:00,007 --> 01:54:03,920
- Is she with her?
- No. She came back and went out again.

1091
01:54:04,047 --> 01:54:06,481
They´re aII out around here.

1092
01:54:37,607 --> 01:54:40,963
He´d have to be reaI crazy to kiII her now.

1093
01:54:41,087 --> 01:54:45,000
I mean, we´re taIking
reaI fuII-bIown insane.

1094
01:54:45,127 --> 01:54:50,326
He is insane. His brain´s upside-down,
but he´s very cunning.

1095
01:54:50,447 --> 01:54:54,406
He won´t go after her with a .45 CoIt,
he´II just push her down the stairs.

1096
01:56:17,167 --> 01:56:19,601
Say night-night, dead girI.

1097
01:56:52,407 --> 01:56:54,318
Is it dark yet?

1098
01:56:54,447 --> 01:56:57,598
No. But it´s getting kinda red.

1099
01:57:01,527 --> 01:57:03,518
I remember red.
