357
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:22,171
Stop shooting!

358
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,617
I just wanted to fight.

359
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,320
I just wanted to fight him.

360
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:41,557
Let's go.

361
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,227
Come on.

362
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:47,343
(ENGINE STARTING)

363
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:51,547
REY: <i>That lady said</i>
<i>it would take about</i>

364
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:53,415
<i>eight hours to get there,</i>
<i>in the old days.</i>

365
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:55,017
<i>But it might take</i>
<i>longer now 'cause</i>

366
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:56,752
<i>a lot of them old roads</i>
<i>ain't there no more.</i>

367
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,488
And all the roads
are bad now anyways

368
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:01,390
so you can't
drive fast on 'em.

369
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:10,966
She said about
eight or nine hours.

370
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:13,635
She wasn't sure if
it was eight or nine.

371
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:16,004
She seemed a bit
confused about it.

372
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:18,374
And why would he
still be there?

373
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,980
He had to wait two
weeks for someone.

374
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:29,685
There's a man there he's got to meet,
it's gonna take two weeks.

375
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:32,755
You know this?
Or this is what he told you?

376
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:35,724
Huh?

377
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:39,561
Your brother
can't be trusted.

378
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:41,663
Is this something
that you know

379
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:43,699
or is this something
that he told you?

380
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,174
Both those things.

381
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,855
You work in the mines?

382
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:09,758
No.

383
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,062
What do you do then?

384
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:20,669
I was a farmer.
And now I'm here.

385
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:27,776
Then how come you learned
how to shoot so good?

386
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,211
You was in the army?

387
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:45,828
When I was a little kid
I grew up on a farm.

388
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:50,499
We had these neighbors,
real old man and lady, Verna and Clarry,

389
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:51,733
they's brother and sister.

390
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:55,604
And they lived on this land
that's all overgrown,

391
00:57:55,606 --> 00:57:59,241
like you couldn't even tell what they farmed,
so overgrown.

392
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:02,711
And Clarry had
these eight tractors,

393
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:04,546
and none of them
worked properly,

394
00:58:04,548 --> 00:58:06,682
so every morning
he'd roll each one

395
00:58:06,684 --> 00:58:08,917
down the hill till
he got one of them started

396
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:12,488
and then use that one to tow all the others back up.
(CHUCKLING)

397
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,724
He did that every day.

398
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,062
And when they died, their family,
who we'd never met before,

399
00:58:20,064 --> 00:58:22,865
came around,
cleared out their house

400
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,101
and they found all this...

401
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:29,638
They found all this
weird stuff in there.

402
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:32,574
Like...

403
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,011
Like 50 therm...

404
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:41,917
Thermionic radio valves.

405
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:46,522
Like them real old valves
they used in old radios.

406
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:50,158
And pyramid of pumpkins.

407
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:55,631
And about 5,000 of these little sticks about this long.

408
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:58,800
And each wrapped
up in newspaper

409
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:01,870
and tied up at the ends
with baling twine.

410
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,079
Why are you telling me this?

411
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:16,051
I just remembered it.

412
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:18,820
It interested me.

413
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:25,827
Not everything has
to be about something.

414
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:38,840
(SIGHING)

415
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:53,655
I'm tryin' to stop thinking about that little girl who died,
but I can't.

416
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,927
You shouldn't.

417
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:03,799
But I can't.

418
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:08,036
You shouldn't stop
thinking about her.

419
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:15,243
You should never stop thinking
about a life you've taken.

420
01:00:15,245 --> 01:00:17,913
It's the price you
pay for taking it.

421
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,727
(RATTLING)

422
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:11,927
That's it, sweetheart.

01:02:11,929 --> 01:02:13,995
Let's start with
the eyelids.

424
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,199
I want you to roll
over onto your front,

425
01:02:17,201 --> 01:02:18,900
put your hands
behind your back.

426
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:20,502
And do it slow.

427
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:24,339
And do it now.

428
01:03:57,066 --> 01:04:00,101
SOLDIER: <i>When are you</i>
<i>gonna say something, cunt?</i>

429
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,874
<i>It's over.</i>

430
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:08,410
It's over for you.

431
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:12,581
I know that.

432
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:15,884
That's good
that you know that.

433
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:19,187
Do you know it, too?

434
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:21,323
Oh, I know it, champ.

435
01:04:21,325 --> 01:04:23,091
I told you it.

436
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:28,563
Do you know it's
over for you, too?

437
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:34,569
Whatever you think's over for
me was over a long time ago.

438
01:04:34,571 --> 01:04:36,438
I'm asking about you.

439
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,139
(CHUCKLING)

440
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:40,108
Are you threatening me?

441
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:41,943
No.

442
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:47,148
A threat means there's still something left to happen.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER

444
01:04:57,994 --> 01:05:00,262
What are you
gonna do with me?

445
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:09,137
You're going to Sydney.

446
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:14,242
Why don't you just shoot me?

447
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,318
Why don't you do it?

448
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,688
That's what
everyone else is doing.

449
01:05:29,192 --> 01:05:34,462
Tells Sydney there's a reason to
keep paying us what they pay us.

450
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:38,133
If we just shot every idiot
we wanted to shoot,

451
01:05:38,135 --> 01:05:40,468
then pretty soon
they'd start to wonder

452
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:42,971
what the fuck
we're doing out here.

453
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:49,110
See, personally
I don't care about you.

454
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:50,612
I don't care if
you get to Sydney and

455
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:52,247
they let you off or
you bribe your way out

456
01:05:52,249 --> 01:05:54,115
or whatever the fuck they do
down there these days.

457
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:56,151
I don't give a fuck.

458
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:59,154
I'm doing this for me.

459
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,223
You're doing
what for you?

460
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:08,330
You're doing what for you?

461
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,271
I murdered my wife.

462
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:23,478
I watched him put his fingers
inside her and I killed 'em both.

463
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,580
No one ever came after me.

464
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:28,116
Ten years ago.

465
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:33,254
I never had
to explain myself.

466
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:39,060
I never had to lie to anyone.
I never had to run and hide.

467
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:42,130
I just buried 'em in
a hole and I went home.

468
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:44,699
No one ever came after me.

469
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:49,270
And that hurt me more than getting my heart broken.

470
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,242
Knowing it didn't matter.

471
01:06:58,247 --> 01:07:02,384
Knowing you can do something like
that and no one comes after you.

472
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:09,624
You do a thing like I did,
that should really mean something.

473
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:15,196
But it just
doesn't matter anymore.

474
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:21,536
Well, champ.

475
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:28,676
Thing you did in Abo town is the
one thing that does matter to us.

476
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:35,316
Now you can do all the lying and confessing you'd like.

477
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:40,288
What feeling do you have when
you wake up in the morning?

478
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:43,825
When your feet
touch the floor?

479
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:48,263
Or before that,
when you're lying there

480
01:07:48,265 --> 01:07:50,565
thinking about your
feet hitting the floor.

481
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,802
What does that
feel like for you?

482
01:07:58,307 --> 01:07:59,674
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

483
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:01,776
No, mate. I don't.

484
01:08:02,379 --> 01:08:07,348
No, mate.
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

Is that it?

490
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:24,699
That was easy.

491
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:28,136
Do I shoot him again
just to be sure?

492
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:30,405
No.

493
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:34,542
That was easy. There
were only three of 'em.

494
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:37,545
Thought it was gonna
be way more harder.

495
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:40,882
You tied up?

496
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,869
I snuck up
on these two.

497
01:09:00,871 --> 01:09:03,338
They were just
hanging there.

498
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:09,677
I came through
the gate here.

499
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:23,858
I dug a hole out.
Slipped underneath the fence.

500
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:33,535
Get the truck over there.

501
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,175
Come on, man.

502
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:28,690
You want me to
drive for a while?

No.

504
01:10:47,376 --> 01:10:49,777
I know I feel
comfortable with someone

505
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:52,513
when I can just sit,
not talking to them.

506
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:54,582
Yeah.

507
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:02,557
I just like sitting there,
not talking.
