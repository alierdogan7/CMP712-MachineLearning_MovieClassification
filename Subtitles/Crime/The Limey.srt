I remember telling your parents,
"if you're looking for a name,

with a constellation."

Well, I wanna know why you need
that scary man in your house.

Gordon ? He's been with me for years.

185
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,790
He's not as tough as he looks.

186
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,960
Then what good is he
? Heard of loyalty ?

187
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,590
Yeah.  I'm loyal to

<i>I'm not ? No.</i>

190
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,840
You're not specific enough to be a
person. You're more like, um, a vibe.

know what transpired exactly.

195
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,660
What ? Our friends downtown.
Someone took them out.

196
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,630
Took them out ? What
the fuck does that mean ?

197
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,370
It used to mean it was similar to a
gangland slaying. Well, maybe it still is.

198
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,800
Well-- 
well, who ?

199
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,810
Well--
blacks ?

200

Blacks ?  No, terry,
it's not their style.

201
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,850
From what I gather,
it was a lone gunman.

<i>Lone gunman ? Oh, jesus,
you sound like the 5:00 news.</i>

Why are you telling me all this shit ?

204
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,460
I didn't want you to hear
about it and then freak out.

205
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,660
Fuck you, jim. I don't
freak out anymore. Oh.

206
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,290
Well, it's probably nothing.

207
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,200
That's usually what senseless
mayhem comes down to, isn't it ?

208
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,100
Bad loan, bad judgment, bad faith.

These were bad people

As long as nobody can
connect anything to me.

213
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,380
No one's gonna connect anything to you.

214
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,480
That was a one-off deal. Like a moving
freight train, you hopped on, you hopped off.

215
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,090
Anything else, I would
have had you walk away.

I befriended them when you needed
them. Let's put it that way.

Well, the cops.
I mean, you know--

Are they satisfied with
this gangland shit or what ?

223
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,110
The cops don't get
satisfied. They get placated.

224
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,720
They're talkin' to the kid who
got away, the kid who called me.

225
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,890
Well, I called them-- scared
out of his wits, this kid.

226
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,720
All he can say is that the
shooter is some crazy guy.

Shooter. Jesus christ.
Yeah, he said he went nuts.

There you go. Jenny must have liked him.

Jenny would say, "here's my
friend eddie." he'd shake my hand.

But the guy wouldn't even
see me. You know what I mean ?

247
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,840
Jenny told me she met him at a
beach, got blinded by his smile.

Can you believe that ? That son
of a bitch never smiled at me.

really had it in for me,

675
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:23,650
And that geezer was top of my list.

676
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,620
Two years after I got sprung,
I sees him in holland park.

677
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,920
He's sittin' on a bench
feeding bloody pigeons.

678
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:32,960
There was no one about. I could've gone up
behind him and snapped his fucking neck--

679
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,930
<i>[ smacks hand ]
wallop-- but I left him.</i>

680
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:36,990
I could've nobbled him, but I didn't.

681
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,500
'cause what I thought I
wanted wasn't what I wanted.

682
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,400
What I thought I was thinkin'
about was something else.

683
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:44,800
I didn't give a toss.
It didn't matter, see ?

684
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:47,910
This bloke on the bench
wasn't worth my time.

685
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:50,140
It meant "sod all" in the end.

686
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:53,140
'cause you've got to make a choice when
to do something and when to let it go.

687
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:55,780
When it matters and when it don't.

688
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:59,120
Bide your time. That's what prison
teaches you, if nothing else.

689
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:02,150
Bide your time and
everything becomes clear,

690
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,620
And you can act accordingly.

691
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:12,960
There's one thing... I don't understand.

692
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:14,970
The thing I don't understand is...

693
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:17,770
Every motherfucking word you're sayin'.

694
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:25,210
Do you know what I reckon ?

695
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,810
You and I are after the same
thing but for different reasons.

696
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,120
And what would that be ?

697
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,120
<i>The reasons ?</i>

698
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:37,120
Start with the "thing."

699
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:41,460
I would hazard a guess that
whatever you're after...

700
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:44,130
Involves a considerable sum of money.

701
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:49,200
And that's not what lights your fire ?

702
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:51,870
In the past, granted,

703
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:55,070
I have been known to
redistribute wealth.

704
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,980
But, no, I'm after another kind of...

705
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,250
Satisfaction.

706
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:04,150
<i>Do you know what I mean ?</i>

707
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,150
You're not from around here, are ya ?

708
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:10,420
You're not carrying any kind of I.D.

709
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:12,760
Who, me ? I.D., no.  No.

710
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:16,190
When your chaps went through my
pockets, there was nothing there.

711

What's your connection
to terry valentine ?

712
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:25,300
My daughter was living
with him when she died.

713
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,640
<i>I imagine about the same time...</i>

714
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:31,640
<i>As whatever the deal was...</i>

715
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:35,110
<i>That terry valentine grafted
you out of your share of.</i>

716
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:37,350
When I say
"grafted," I--

717
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:40,420
<i>You think terry valentine
screwed me out of some deal ?</i>

718
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:45,320
It wouldn't surprise me. I mean, he's
about as straight as a dog's hind leg.

719
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:49,260
[ inhaling forcefully ] what could
this deal have been, I wonder,

720
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:54,770
<i>To have set in motion such an
unfortunate chain of events ?</i>

721
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:58,870
Hmph.  It could have been anything.

722
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:02,110
A shitload of heroin imported
from somewhere or other,

723
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:04,540
The usual scumbags involved.

724
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:07,140
But, you know, the
thing about scumbags is:

725
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:12,550
No matter what they do with the drugs,
the harder thing to move is the money.

726
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:16,120
In my line of work, the best
thing to do is to follow the money,

727
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:18,590
Because you can't hide the money.

728
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:20,820
You can only disguise
it. So what do you do ?

729
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:26,130
You find some rich fool to bank all the
cash coming in, make it look legitimate...

730
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,670
In exchange for skimming
a percentage off the top.

731
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:32,400
Maybe as much as a million
dollars commission ?

732
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:35,570
A rich fool who overextended
himself over time,

733
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,940
In danger of not being so rich anymore.

734
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:42,150
But I can't be sure.
I can't prove anything.

735
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:44,150
Anything at all.

736
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:49,290
What was your daughter's involvement ?

737
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:51,860
That's what I wanna know.

738
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,090
I was hopin' you might.

739
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,030
The security guard that
works for valentine,

740
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,300
He's the one who sent
those creeps after you.

741
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:02,400
I shouldn't wonder.
Yeah, it must've been.

742
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:07,700
He's kind of a slippery fellow, but he
keeps his hands clean and valentine's.

743
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:13,140
Darn it. There go my...

Slippery hands again.

745
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:32,030
There was an incident in downtown
los angeles a couple of days ago...

746
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:37,830
That may have spurred this...
Most recent... Activity.

747
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,840
But you wouldn't know
anything about that, right ?

748
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,070
Thank you.

749
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:52,420
Your daughter, she had a
fondness for dangerous men ?

750
00:59:57,690 --> 00:59:59,620
Shame about the money, though,

751
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:01,860
Goin' into valentine's
pocket and not yours.

752
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:05,230
I don't give a shit about the money.

753
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:10,400
Personally, I prefer the heroin.

754
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,140
See, crooks move faster than the system,

755
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:19,380
So if we're gonna clean
up the neighborhood,

756
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:25,350
We don't have time to wait for things
like search warrants and trials.

757

I was comin' back from,
um, a motorcycle classic...

771
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,280
In a place called sturgis, south dakota,

772
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:31,080
And on my motorcycle on u.S. Highway 14,

773
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:34,380
On just that side of spotted
horse, I ran into a deer.

I hit a deer. I had no chance. 
Even though the highway patrol had--

775

Highway people had
mowed the sides--

Where the culverts
were, they couldn't mow.

I had a chance to say one word.

It was, "fuck !" and I hit it.

780
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:54,700
I know this: If the bullet's coming
my way, and I see my name on it,

781

I won't be calling for my
mother. [ both chuckling ]

But, man, I tell ya, I think the only reason
I'm alive and telling this story now...

783
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:06,650
Is because of the big f.L. Front end
and that solid tire on my fat boy.

Oh, your fat boy. Yeah.

785
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,950
Exactly.  I was wearing-- it
was the fat boy. [ chuckles ]

I saw the ground, and I
thought, "mmm, put it down."

787

And I just rode the bike
down into the ground.
