1
00:02:06,086 --> 00:02:08,338
Mayor Bader, what do you
have to say about all the recent violence?

2
00:02:08,422 --> 00:02:11,174
We have men in the field, boys.
Sheriff's Department is on it.

3
00:02:11,258 --> 00:02:12,509
When will some arrests be made?

4
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:14,928
- Any day now.
- Have you lost control of the city?

5
00:02:15,012 --> 00:02:16,638
There's no need for wild accusations.

6
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:18,307
<i>- But the bodies are piling up.</i>

7
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:22,144
<i>- Eleven murders and counting.</i>

8
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:25,314
- That's a statement, not a question.
- Have you lost control of the city?

9
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:28,025
Sheriff Keck and his men are taking
every possible measure

10
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:30,652
<i>- to ensure public safety.</i>

11
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:33,238
- Have you lost control?
- We absolutely have not.

12
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,450
Is that what you want the tourists to believe?

13
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:38,535
The everyday visitor has nothing to fear.

14
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:40,662
Nothing to fear except gunfire.

15
00:02:40,746 --> 00:02:43,290
<i>These attacks are
gangsters versus gangsters</i>

16
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:46,710
and ordinary citizens have
no cause for undue concern.

17
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,008
So you admit this town you claim to control
is in the hands of criminals?

18
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:55,093
- Where they from?
- New York? Philly?

19
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:23,455
<i>- Where they from?
- New York? Philly? Chicago?</i>

20
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:26,041
- <i>They Italians?
- One at a time, please. One at a time.</i>

21
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:27,751
<i>Are they the ones behind
the shootings at The Ritz?</i>

22
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,045
Now, once again, that is the kind
of irresponsible exaggeration...

23
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:32,631
- What about the North Side killings?
- Are the Negroes involved?

24
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:35,217
- If you let me get a word in...
- Where's Nucky Thompson?

25
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,636
- Mr. Thompson...
- Is he pulling the strings?

26
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,262
- Mr. Thompson...
- Is he alive or dead?

27
00:03:39,346 --> 00:03:40,972
Let's get something straight.

28
00:03:41,056 --> 00:03:44,601
Nucky Thompson doesn't run this city. I do.

29
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:48,730
Right!

30
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:51,483
REPORTER 23 That's a riot.

31
00:03:54,986 --> 00:03:58,615
<i>I left you nine messages at The Ritz.
I'm completely in the dark out here.</i>

32
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:01,701
<i>- They don't</i> have <i>papers</i> in <i>Pennsylvania?
- Did I miss something?</i>

33
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:06,248
<i>- I'm fighting</i> a war from a <i>fucking lumberyard.
- Now see? This is all new information.</i>

34
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:09,668
<i>- Are you at Overholt?
- I've been here for five days.</i>

35
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,795
<i>And?</i>

36
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:15,340
<i>- Don't you know what you got here'?
- I've never been near the place.</i>

37
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:16,758
Then you need to come see it.

38
00:04:16,842 --> 00:04:19,636
I can't make it down the block
without getting shot at.

39
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,221
<i>That's</i> too bad.

40
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:22,889
<i>'Cause it's worth the trip.</i>

41
00:04:22,973 --> 00:04:24,808
What the fuck are you trying to tell me?

42
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:26,685
<i>Well, I'm no expert,</i>

43
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:31,189
but this place gets cooking,
you're the biggest bootlegger in the country.

44
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:38,029
<i>- Did</i> you hear me?
- I'll call you back.

45
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:46,496
What the fuck is going on?
Break it up. I said break it up!

46
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:50,459
- Hey, get off! Get off!
- You bastard!

47
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:54,713
- You promised to keep a lid on this.
- Got to blow off steam some kind of ways.

48
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:56,882
He gave his word they'd
stay on their own side.

49
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:58,175
How they supposed to get to the head?

50
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:00,635
Dig a hole. Why's it my problem?

51
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:02,554
How about I give you the shovel
and you do the digging?

52
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:05,348
Chalky, enough.

53
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,019
Okay?

54
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,820
Let's get something straight.
I need him and I need those men.

55
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:20,739
Maybe I ought to take my boys and go home.

56
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:23,241
Fine, call Torrio. Tell him the deal's off.

57
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:25,327
No, the deal's with me.

58
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,622
Then what's a handshake
with you supposed to be worth?

59
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:33,835
We'll head to the Boardwalk,
down by Margate.

60
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,254
See if we can get Rosetti
to stick his head out.

61
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:37,964
You need to watch out for civilians.

62
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:42,344
No, we need to watch out for ourselves.
The rest is for you to clean up.

63
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:44,763
Get your bingo-bongos to help.

64
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:47,766
Come on, we're going hunting.

65
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:55,106
You were all told to lay off the supply.

66
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,109
The whores are gone. The fuck we supposed
to do if we can't have a drink?

67
00:05:58,193 --> 00:06:00,529
Keep sober so you don't
get taken out next time.

68
00:06:00,612 --> 00:06:03,490
If I'm gonna catch it, I'd rather be tight.

69
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:08,328
- You want the boss to hear you say that?
- What the fuck do I care anymore?

70
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:15,377
No wine.

71
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,214
Forget about it.
I no come all this way to have a drink.

72
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:23,134
Keep everyone away from here.

73
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:25,804
Let's go.

74
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,607
How many men I give you?

75
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:40,652
- Exactly?
- Exactly.

76
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:43,446
- Forty-three.
- Huh.

77
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,325
And how many of my men you have left?
Exactly?

78
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:51,538
Thirty-one. Plus nine of my own.

79
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:57,127
So 12 of my men you lose. And for what?

80
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,844
I got the hotel.

81
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:10,557
I got the casino.

82
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:13,310
I got his warehouse.

83
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:16,938
You no have Nucky Thompson.

84
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:22,193
Huh? And Arnold Rothstein,
he's still eating dinner in Times Square.

85
00:07:22,902 --> 00:07:26,406
All these words you say, what do they mean?

86
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:28,533
I'm leaving bodies on the ground, Joe.

87
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:31,411
We're winning.

88
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:34,539
And half of Thompson's crew, they're shines.

89
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:37,125
You can't count them as a whole person.

90
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:39,294
Kid...

91
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:42,172
They are from here.

92
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,841
So?

93
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:47,677
This is their home.

94
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:51,222
That's why they fight.

95
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,433
And the other ones, who are they?

96
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:56,353
What does it matter once they're dead?

97
00:07:56,436 --> 00:07:58,605
Everyone dies.

98
00:07:59,314 --> 00:08:01,441
Not everyone keeps their promises.

99
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:06,321
I'm gonna keep mine.

100
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:21,753
Hmm.

101
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:29,886
Ah.

102
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:32,806
Perfect.

103
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:36,893
Now you know what time it is.

104
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:43,566
Let's go, boys.

105
00:08:57,455 --> 00:08:59,374
I'd like to go in, please.

106
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:12,470
Such a gentleman.

107
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:15,306
Not always.

108
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:36,870
Dear. I have your lunch.

109
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:42,459
It's your favorite.

110
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:45,920
Ham on white bread. A dill pickle.

111
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:50,008
And Oreos if you finish everything.

112
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:56,389
Aren't you hungry?

113
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,239
Why don't you come out
and we'll eat together?

114
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:14,532
Would you like that?

115
00:10:18,912 --> 00:10:23,541
Then I'll come in and sit with you.
That way, it won't be so lonely.

116
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:46,689
Yes.

117
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:51,611
All right, darling.

118
00:10:54,906 --> 00:10:56,366
I understand.

119
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,086
Harry, come on, we gotta go!

120
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:11,881
<i>I'll</i> get my jacket.

121
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:14,968
Hey, who's gonna do the cookin' today?

122
00:11:19,514 --> 00:11:21,891
Hey, Jimmy,
you hear the game last night?

123
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:25,144
Here. It's good for another scrape.

124
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:28,940
- I'm in the middle of this.
- What happened?

125
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:31,776
Slug straight through the radiator.

126
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:35,822
- And the hose is shot.
- I'll do that after.

127
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:44,038
- You're gonna get all dirty.
- Who kept that old Willys of yours running?

128
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:47,500
- Who sold it to me in the first place?
- Wasn't anything wrong with it.

129
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,378
Except for the brakes,
rear axle, cylinder heads.

130
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:54,132
Worked well enough to get you
and June lost in the woods.

131
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:57,260
Yeah, those were nice rides.

132
00:11:57,969 --> 00:11:59,762
You got them someplace safe?

133
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:04,475
With her sister up in Brigantine.

134
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:08,688
- You?
- How's that?

135
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:10,857
Margaret and the kids.

136
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:16,279
OW! Shit!

137
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:18,948
Fuck.

138
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:22,076
What are you laughing about?

139
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,080
Who said I'm laughing?

140
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:34,881
Look at us.

141
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:39,427
Two Pineys and a broke-down car.

142
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:47,435
- Maybe that's why.
- Why what?

143
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:51,648
We didn't stop while the going was good.

144
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:56,152
Always trying to pinch for a little bit more.
Just in case.

145
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:58,905
I never told them to pass
the 18th Amendment.

146
00:12:59,197 --> 00:13:00,323
Did you?

147
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,076
Where's it gotten us?

148
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:07,205
Worry about that later.

149
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:10,208
After Rosetti's in the ground.

150
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,877
- Then what?
- Get the town running again.

151
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:17,590
Keep everybody in line this time.
Leave that part to me.

152
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:21,094
- Stop kidding yourself, Eli.
- You'll never be Sheriff again.

153
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:25,890
You got to rub my face in it? Hmm?
After all this?

154
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:28,935
That's not what I meant.

155
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:32,981
It's over here however this plays out.

156
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:36,025
No one's gonna come within 100 yards of me.

157
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:38,361
Not in Atlantic City. Not in New York.

158
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:41,739
- Not anywhere.
- Sure they will.

159
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:45,034
You just got to offer
them something they want.

160
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:46,911
How do I do that?

161
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:49,414
I don't know.

162
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:52,458
You're the man with all the angles.

163
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:04,721
<i>- Mr. Doyle.
- Am I disturbing you?</i>

164
00:14:05,221 --> 00:14:06,222
Yes.

165
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:09,100
Oh, all right.

166
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:12,270
I know you didn't want to talk to me again.

167
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,399
It's just... I'm all at sea over here.

168
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:30,288
And, uh, where is it you've gone adrift?

169
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,457
<i>I'm saying three words.</i>

170
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:36,461
Overholt. Distillery. Pennsylvania.

171
00:14:36,586 --> 00:14:38,671
I know about Overholt, Mr. Doyle.

172
00:14:38,838 --> 00:14:42,133
What I don't is why you
wish to discuss it with me.

173
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,344
Because I'm sitting in it

174
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,764
right now.

175
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:49,307
It's

176
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:52,060
very large.

177
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:56,731
And a certain person that we both know

178
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:59,984
made an arrangement
with another person to run it.

179
00:15:00,318 --> 00:15:03,654
<i>But that first person, his back is to the wall.</i>

180
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:10,620
I bet he'd give up anything
just to keep from going under for a third time.

181
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,417
I'm listening.

182
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:31,516
How'd you get that scar?

183
00:15:32,183 --> 00:15:34,852
Mulberry Bend. You know where that is?

184
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:37,355
- Sure.
- Bandit's Alley.

185
00:15:37,814 --> 00:15:40,733
Little shit came up behind me
one night with a shank,

186
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:44,362
carved me another smile.

187
00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:48,241
It's a park now. Push your baby in a stroller.

188
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:52,036
Pricks like you, they come and go.
Nobody remembers them.

189
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:53,788
All that stays is the law.

190
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:57,250
Then I guess I'd better reform my ways.

191
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:10,429
- Who's your partner?
- Nobody.

192
00:16:10,513 --> 00:16:12,098
Who do you buy from?

193
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,891
- Some chink.
- Which one?

194
00:16:13,975 --> 00:16:16,811
Fuck do I know?
Name sounds like a toothache.

195
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,146
Who put up the money?

196
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:19,647
My sister.

197
00:16:20,148 --> 00:16:22,900
She lifted it from your wallet
while she was yanking your ghianda.

198
00:16:23,276 --> 00:16:25,444
There's something you don't understand.

199
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:27,905
You think you get some shyster,

200
00:16:28,573 --> 00:16:30,616
walk out of here, beat the rap?

201
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,578
You could disappear.

202
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:36,581
You said there was the law.

203
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,584
We are the law.

204
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:42,670
What if...

205
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:46,382
What if I tell you where you
could find 50 pounds of white?

206
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:47,592
Yours?

207
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:52,221
- Why would I give up my own stash?
- To save your ass.

208
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:57,727
- Is that what you're offering?
- Nobody is offering anything.

209
00:16:57,852 --> 00:16:59,228
Then what's in it for me?

210
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,272
You like to gamble, don't you?

211
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,025
Only when I got a chance of winning.

212
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,029
Best you could do here is not lose.

213
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,245
I got the broad here.

214
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,748
Please show her in.

215
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:24,503
That's all right. Thank you.

216
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:31,510
May I sit?

217
00:17:32,303 --> 00:17:35,056
It's your house.
You don't have to ask permission.

218
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:45,816
Must be hard to be away from your girls.

219
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:48,236
Huh?

220
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:50,112
Your two daughters.

221
00:17:50,196 --> 00:17:52,573
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

222
00:17:52,657 --> 00:17:54,158
At that age,

223
00:17:55,368 --> 00:17:58,955
you take off for a few days, you miss so much.

224
00:17:59,497 --> 00:18:02,792
- How old are they?
- Sixteen and 14, I think.

225
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:06,629
- Tommy's only six.
- Six.

226
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,674
Got his whole life ahead of him.

227
00:18:10,341 --> 00:18:14,220
I've tried to shelter him from harsh realities.

228
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,223
It hasn't been easy.

229
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:18,891
Hey.

230
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,811
Don't get so down on yourself.

231
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,480
You're doing a swell job.

232
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:28,693
There's always company around here.
Kids love that.

233
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:32,238
Maybe...

234
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:35,950
Maybe it's best we let you
conduct your business

235
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,369
without distractions.

236
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,372
Don't see what you're getting at.

237
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:44,750
That Tommy and I go someplace else.
Just for a bit.

238
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:46,877
Yeah.

239
00:18:47,378 --> 00:18:49,171
I don't think I want that.

240
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:50,756
Why not?

241
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:53,551
I like having you around.

242
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:56,345
If I didn't know where you were,

243
00:18:57,013 --> 00:18:59,890
I might get anxious.

244
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:04,061
You don't have to worry about me.

245
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:07,148
Jeez, Red, I hope not.

246
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:11,402
This is gonna work out. You'll see.

247
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,573
Get everything settled,

248
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:18,868
then you and me,

249
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,413
we'll show this town how it's done.

250
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,248
You and me?

251
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:26,584
Set you up fine.

252
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:28,961
Best of everything.

253
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:34,050
All this grief running whores,
you won't need to bother.

254
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:37,011
I'm gonna treat you like a queen.

255
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,722
Would you?

256
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:42,308
Up there on a pedestal.

257
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,396
And where are you?

258
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:57,490
I'm way down below.

259
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:01,952
Like a little bug crawling around on your toe.

260
00:20:05,748 --> 00:20:07,625
I could crush you.

261
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,378
Just squash me flat

262
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:13,297
till I'm begging for more.

263
00:20:18,761 --> 00:20:21,097
Is that what you'd like?

264
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:33,526
I'm just having some fun.

265
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:37,279
People have fun in different ways.

266
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:42,243
There's no need

267
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:45,287
to be ashamed of any of them.

268
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:50,167
That's what this club is all about.

269
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,300
You're a pistol, Red.

270
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:04,932
Then why don't you pull my trigger
and see what shoots out?

271
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:18,195
I don't know about you, Gyp,

272
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:20,531
but sometimes,

273
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:23,451
I wish someone

274
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:25,911
would give me exactly

275
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:29,248
what I deserve.

276
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:50,144
<i>- Hello?
- This is Arnold Rothstein.</i>

277
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:51,979
<i>To whom am I speaking?</i>

278
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,355
Eli Thompson.

279
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:55,858
<i>I was hoping to speak to your brother.</i>

280
00:21:58,194 --> 00:21:59,570
It's him.

281
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:09,580
Arnold.

282
00:22:09,914 --> 00:22:13,918
<i>- I'm</i> calling <i>with an offer.
- How did you get this number?</i>

283
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:16,712
Is that important?

284
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:19,507
No.

285
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:22,259
<i>Your distillery in Pennsylvania.</i>

286
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:25,346
<i>- Overholt.
- For</i> a <i>percentage of ownership,</i>

287
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:29,225
<i>I can arrange for Joe Masseria
to back away from Gyp Rosetti.</i>

288
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,186
"Back away" meaning what?

289
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,357
<i>That he completely pulls his support,
removes all of his men.</i>

290
00:22:36,482 --> 00:22:38,108
How much of a percentage?

291
00:22:39,485 --> 00:22:40,945
Ninety-nine,

292
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,614
Mr. Thompson.

293
00:22:44,532 --> 00:22:47,159
<i>I will require 99%.</i>

294
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:52,665
I'm offering you a way out.

295
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:56,835
If I can deliver Masseria,

296
00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:59,505
<i>do we have a deal?</i>

297
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:03,551
Yes.

298
00:23:03,676 --> 00:23:05,803
<i>You'll be hearing from me later.</i>

299
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:15,563
Big bait catches big rat.

300
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:24,613
- Have you lived here long, Mrs. Hollis?
- I'd say it's 16 years.

301
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:28,659
Spring of '07. So, yes, just 16.

302
00:23:28,826 --> 00:23:32,121
Harold wanted to be somewhere he felt
he could be of the most use.

303
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:35,165
I can't say I didn't have
other ambitions in mind.

304
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:38,794
But we stayed, and I think
that turned out to be the right decision.

305
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,464
You live...

306
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:46,218
Over on Scholes Street. By Graham.

307
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,304
You've got everything you need there.

308
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,140
It's not far from the rest of my family.

309
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:53,684
Harold has a sister in Bushwick.

310
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:00,608
Well, dear?

311
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:07,448
- Why don't you show Mrs...
- Rohan.

312
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:10,743
Mrs. Rohan the room
and she can make her decision.

313
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,661
I'll just tend to a few things.

314
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,038
Would you like to?

315
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,750
- I would, yes.
- All right.

316
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:33,807
This is where my husband sees people.
Coughs, cuts, fevers,

317
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:37,227
indigestion, everything.

318
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:41,315
I need to bring my monthly on.

319
00:24:42,024 --> 00:24:43,859
When was your last?

320
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:46,070
- Six weeks.
- He can help you then.

321
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:48,614
He does that for many women.

322
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:54,203
He's very careful. Very thorough.

323
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:03,128
You can take a little time.

324
00:25:03,796 --> 00:25:06,340
Come back if that's what you'd like.

325
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:09,176
I'm lost.

326
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,639
I'm completely lost.

327
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,686
I never tell anyone what to do.

328
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:32,074
Do I leave my dress on?

329
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:36,245
I'll get you a clean gown.

330
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:52,010
You're looking at this the wrong way.

331
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,348
The bulls collared me, all right?

332
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:00,978
But I worked out an angle.

333
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,443
I'm not doing time. And no one's the wiser.

334
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:11,822
We just pick up where we left off.

335
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:19,997
And I'll cover the hit.

336
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:25,085
I will, Meyer. I guarantee it.

337
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:26,795
Out of my pocket.

338
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:36,430
- You're not gonna say nothing?
-50 pounds.

339
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:40,184
One hundred thousand

340
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:42,686
fucking dollars.

341
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:53,697
- Gentlemen.
- Let's get this over with.

342
00:27:06,084 --> 00:27:07,377
What the fuck?

343
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:08,712
Salvatore...

344
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:13,759
I'm glad to see you're alright.

345
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,596
And you.

346
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:22,184
I sorry. I never know your name.

347
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:24,978
Meyer.

348
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:26,730
"Maya."

349
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:28,565
Is that ours?

350
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:31,026
Not anymore.

351
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:37,574
Charlie, Meyer, thank you for coming.

352
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:39,284
I won't keep you very long

353
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:42,079
since you have such full
portions on your plates.

354
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:45,582
What's that doing here?

355
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:47,459
I had it delivered

356
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:51,463
so that Mr. Masseria could see
that I'm as good as my word.

357
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:54,758
The two of you?

358
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:56,969
Have agreed to new terms of peace

359
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:59,388
given the change in circumstances.

360
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:01,181
What change?

361
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:03,267
That this heroin

362
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,228
that I paid for with my fucking money,

363
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:09,606
now belongs to him.

364
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:13,443
A.R., if I may inquire,
how did you obtain that?

365
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:16,113
Charlie gave it to my associates.

366
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:19,491
Sam, Gaetano, if you would.

367
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,328
How you doing, kid?

368
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,205
We treat you too rough?

369
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,960
You can always
file a complaint with the department.

370
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:42,306
He set me up, Joe.

371
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:47,102
You fucking set me up.

372
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:50,480
Who the fuck do you think you are?

373
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:52,608
- Charlie. Charlie.
- I worked for that.

374
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:54,526
I busted my ass for that.

375
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,445
It was my idea! My deal!

376
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:57,946
- Charlie.
- You wouldn't lift a finger.

377
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,324
Sit behind your desk, making phone calls.

378
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,784
I'm out there in the fucking world.

379
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:06,121
Charlie, if you don't shut up,
we're both dead. Yes?

380
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,851
A.R., Mr. Masseria,

381
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:31,063
you know how he gets.

382
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:41,573
All this time
I thought I'd had some civilizing effect.

383
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:46,119
But there's only so much
you can teach a person

384
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:50,248
until you reach the limits of his capabilities.

385
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:57,297
- You understand, though, don't you, Meyer?
- Yes, I do.

386
00:29:57,381 --> 00:30:00,384
Then it's your job then if you want it.

387
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:06,723
Seeing as how I'm flush with product,
I'd like to offer a proposition.

388
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,644
How would you like to join me
in the heroin business?

389
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,856
In exchange for what?

390
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:28,537
- Son of a bitch.
- Dirty fucking shines.

391
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,831
Hey, what the fuck do you think you're doing?

392
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:33,208
Can't be too hard to figure out.

393
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:34,668
Give you a better view.

394
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:37,004
Just back it up, pal. Okay?

395
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:40,549
I don't know about you, once I let loose,
there ain't no stopping.

396
00:30:40,632 --> 00:30:43,010
Yeah, get you some of that.

397
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:44,594
I can help you with that.

398
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:48,432
And me with both hands full.

399
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:52,769
Ain't that just like a dinge?
Going out with his dick swinging.

400
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,361
Come on, Joe.

401
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:03,947
Sure do like to reach for that pistol.

402
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:15,542
What you so scared about?

403
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:19,171
Nothing I'm looking at now.

404
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,805
Let's see what you're made of.

405
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:31,391
MANI Chalky!

406
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:34,144
Let him go. Come on.

407
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:42,152
I just hung up with Arnold Rothstein.

408
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,863
Gyp Rosetti's at the Artemis Club.

409
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:47,532
Joe Masseria is withdrawing his support.

410
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:49,659
I know that, Rosetti doesn't.

411
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:52,287
- How'd that happen?
- I paid for it.

412
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:56,166
I need to talk to you and you in private.

413
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:06,301
You can kill each other later.
In the meantime, let's plan this out.

414
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:18,271
Talk about this later.

415
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,905
Do YOU approve?

416
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:32,410
- You're class all the way, Red.
- I'm here to please you.

417
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:39,751
All you have to do is say the word.

418
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:06,069
Only I do that.

419
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:17,080
Little kink of mine.

420
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:31,094
I like a man who's careful
about his appearance.

421
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:38,518
Well? What is it you're intending to do to me?

422
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:45,775
- You really want to know?
- I can't wait.

423
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:51,281
I'm gonna break you in half.

424
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:57,829
Split you right down the middle
till you beg me to stop. But I won't stop.

425
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:01,333
Beg and beg, but there's nothing you can do.

426
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:04,336
And when I'm done,

427
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:09,466
there won't be nothing left but a wet spot
and a hunk of hair.

428
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:12,844
You know why?

429
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:19,351
Tell me.

430
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:27,984
You're a worthless piece of shit.

431
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:32,822
- Am I?
- You know you are.

432
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:35,116
You look in the mirror
and you know you deserve

433
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:37,118
everything you're gonna get.

434
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:42,332
I'm ugly, aren't I?

435
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,253
Just an ugly little animal.

436
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:48,588
- Say it again.
- Ugly...

437
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,508
little...

438
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:54,552
ape.

439
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:58,765
You laughing at me?

440
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:02,852
Why wouldn't I?

441
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:05,814
Everybody else does.

442
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,821
Go ahead if that's what you want.

443
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:32,090
Would you like me to whip you?

444
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:05,790
That's not tight enough, is it?

445
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:07,834
- No.
- Not for an ape like you.

446
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:09,294
No.

447
00:36:10,128 --> 00:36:15,759
You need to be held down.
So you don't run off into the jungle.

448
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:27,645
What do you say?

449
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:30,565
- Hurt me.
- Hurt me what?

450
00:36:30,648 --> 00:36:32,901
Hurt me, please.

451
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:40,200
Oh, Red, here I just thought
we were having some fun.

452
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:44,496
All I have is this house and that boy.

453
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:47,457
I don't blame you, Red. I really don't.

454
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:51,336
But the thing of it is,
somebody's always got to lose.

455
00:37:09,145 --> 00:37:11,481
That car ready?

456
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:20,323
What the fuck?
Where they going?

457
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:27,288
What the fuck is going on?

458
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,379
Hey!

459
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,884
Hey, where the fuck is everybody?

460
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,219
- They're gone.
- Gone where?

461
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:42,595
New York. Masseria's orders.

462
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,683
Get down!

463
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:51,104
No,no,no!

464
00:37:58,528 --> 00:38:00,280
Go!

465
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:14,669
- Where's Tonino?
- Fuck him, let's go.

466
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:35,602
Put the gun down.

467
00:40:39,772 --> 00:40:42,525
Do you think I give a fuck?

468
00:40:45,862 --> 00:40:48,781
Put it down.

469
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,498
Put it down!

470
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:18,603
Tommy, close your eyes.

471
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,912
Here comes Masseria's boys.

472
00:41:37,038 --> 00:41:39,791
And here they go.

473
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:59,268
Die, you fucking cowards!

474
00:42:01,312 --> 00:42:04,190
That's for you, sons of bitches!

475
00:42:26,337 --> 00:42:28,131
Well, I got that out of my system.

476
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,675
You and me both.

477
00:42:40,476 --> 00:42:43,146
Come on. Back to Chicago.

478
00:42:50,778 --> 00:42:52,864
Jesus Christ.

479
00:42:58,661 --> 00:42:59,996
God.

480
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:07,962
Jesus.

481
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,210
Who did this?

482
00:43:50,755 --> 00:43:52,048
You came.

483
00:43:52,715 --> 00:43:54,008
Where's Rosetti?

484
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:58,721
I was good. I did what...

485
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:02,725
I went upstairs like you said to.

486
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:07,104
- What?
- And the man...

487
00:44:08,648 --> 00:44:10,358
The man, he...

488
00:44:14,779 --> 00:44:20,493
Nucky. He did something very bad to me.

489
00:44:56,779 --> 00:44:58,322
Who is it?

490
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:02,910
- Who's there?
- Me.

491
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:09,417
Don't turn on the light.

492
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,880
Why? What happened?

493
00:45:13,963 --> 00:45:18,968
- Richard, are you all right?
- Neither of us are hurt.

494
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:21,178
What does that mean?

495
00:45:26,017 --> 00:45:27,685
It's not our blood.

496
00:45:29,896 --> 00:45:31,564
Then whose is it?

497
00:45:32,857 --> 00:45:36,402
Take the boy. Go on.

498
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:52,877
Upstairs. Fred's room.

499
00:45:53,544 --> 00:45:56,547
- I need to know what's going on.
- Just take him up.

500
00:45:57,506 --> 00:45:59,634
Julia, please.

501
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:09,602
And turn off that lamp.

502
00:46:14,565 --> 00:46:16,525
Did anyone see you pull up?

503
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:23,115
You don't come home like this.

504
00:46:23,908 --> 00:46:25,826
Whatever battle you're fighting.

505
00:46:26,494 --> 00:46:29,038
That's not what a soldier does.

506
00:46:29,747 --> 00:46:32,124
You need to clean yourself up.

507
00:46:33,501 --> 00:46:36,379
<i>- I'll</i> talk to her, and in the light of day...
- No.

508
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:43,594
He's safe. That's all that matters.

509
00:47:08,786 --> 00:47:11,706
Randolph. Hello?

510
00:47:12,415 --> 00:47:15,292
<i>- This is Andrew Mellon.
- Is it really?</i>

511
00:47:15,418 --> 00:47:17,461
Why would I claim otherwise?

512
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:22,717
Are you in a location
where your conversation might be overheard?

513
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:33,185
<i>- No one can</i> hear <i>me, sir.
- Then I have</i> a <i>request.</i>

514
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:37,648
It has come to my attention
that a certain business enterprise of mine,

515
00:47:38,816 --> 00:47:41,068
in the absence of my full attention,

516
00:47:42,028 --> 00:47:45,698
has been illicitly commandeered
by a criminal organization.

517
00:47:45,781 --> 00:47:47,742
<i>What enterprise, sir?</i>

518
00:47:47,825 --> 00:47:50,870
The Overholt Distillery
in western Pennsylvania.

519
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:53,581
I don't understand what you want me to do.

520
00:47:53,664 --> 00:47:55,791
Shutter the premises.

521
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:58,419
Apprehend and indict anyone

522
00:47:58,502 --> 00:48:01,297
<i>associated with its illegal operation.</i>

523
00:48:01,964 --> 00:48:04,884
You want me to arrest Enoch Thompson?

524
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:08,179
<i>It was Mr. Thompson
who brought this illegality to my attention.</i>

525
00:48:08,512 --> 00:48:11,307
<i>Then who are we talking about?</i>

526
00:48:15,603 --> 00:48:17,855
- Arnold...
- Arnold...

527
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:21,484
- Rothstein.
- Rothstein.

528
00:48:49,178 --> 00:48:52,848
- Made it out.
- Hiding in the closet.

529
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:54,642
Whatever you had to do.

530
00:48:55,226 --> 00:48:58,521
That guy with the mask,
what the fuck was that?

531
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:09,365
Can't go to New York.
Not gonna be too welcome there.

532
00:49:11,492 --> 00:49:16,247
So, just a suggestion,
we lay low in the woods.

533
00:49:16,997 --> 00:49:19,792
The, what do you call, the Poconos.

534
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:23,254
Get our bearings, fresh air,
figure out our next move.

535
00:49:23,337 --> 00:49:26,090
Relax, it's a party.

536
00:49:27,383 --> 00:49:28,384
Huh?

537
00:49:32,555 --> 00:49:34,974
I'm making a big decision.

538
00:49:36,267 --> 00:49:37,601
From now on,

539
00:49:37,685 --> 00:49:40,646
I'm only selling hooch every other Thursday.

540
00:49:41,355 --> 00:49:43,190
Because I have important friends.

541
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:45,901
I'm an important person.

542
00:49:46,443 --> 00:49:50,906
I have important
garters holding up my very important socks.

543
00:49:51,448 --> 00:49:56,036
Do you have any idea who the fuck I am?

544
00:49:56,745 --> 00:49:57,746
Do you?

545
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,457
Do you?

546
00:50:00,541 --> 00:50:03,419
- You're Nucky Thompson.
- I'm Barney Google.

547
00:50:03,711 --> 00:50:06,213
With the goo-goo-googly eyes.

548
00:50:06,297 --> 00:50:11,844
And I never, ever take anything personal.

549
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:25,191
Fuck 'em all, huh?

550
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:29,153
I came here with nothing.

551
00:50:29,236 --> 00:50:31,197
How do you lose what you never had?

552
00:50:31,739 --> 00:50:35,117
Start over.
What this country's all about, right?

553
00:50:37,745 --> 00:50:39,663
So we head west.

554
00:50:40,456 --> 00:50:42,541
Find some hick burg.

555
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:45,336
Blow 'em right over. How hard could that be?

556
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:52,676
Couple of speaks, truck in some girls,

557
00:50:53,135 --> 00:50:57,306
keep the whole operation nice and tight.

558
00:50:59,141 --> 00:51:01,936
And maybe I don't tell the wife, huh?

559
00:51:04,146 --> 00:51:09,276
Yeah. Maybe I just do that.

560
00:51:11,612 --> 00:51:17,868
<i>Barney Google
with the goo-goo-googly eyes</i>

561
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:23,958
<i>Barney Google
bet his horse would win the prize</i>

562
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:29,922
<i>When the horses ran that day
Spark Plug ran the other way</i>

563
00:51:30,172 --> 00:51:32,258
<i>Barney Google</i>

564
00:51:55,531 --> 00:51:57,324
I'm sorry. I gotta.

565
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:47,958
It's done.

566
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,920
Take him back to Masseria.

567
00:52:52,379 --> 00:52:55,924
Let him know this
could be the end of the problems between us.

568
00:52:56,592 --> 00:52:58,177
Or the beginning.

569
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,137
I'll oblige him either way.

570
00:53:01,263 --> 00:53:02,681
Is that clear?

571
00:53:05,851 --> 00:53:11,482
Tonino, I see you in Atlantic City again,
I'll kill you myself.

572
00:53:24,703 --> 00:53:27,539
I don't want anyone knowing who I am.

573
00:53:28,624 --> 00:53:31,710
I don't want anyone looking into my business.

574
00:53:33,253 --> 00:53:38,133
I don't want anyone coming near us
we don't already trust.

575
00:53:44,473 --> 00:53:46,016
Okay, brother.

576
00:54:22,678 --> 00:54:24,430
I just want to talk.

577
00:54:25,389 --> 00:54:26,682
That's all.

578
00:54:27,724 --> 00:54:29,685
Can we do that?

579
00:54:36,525 --> 00:54:40,821
I'm not going to... I would never hurt you.

580
00:54:41,613 --> 00:54:43,198
I'm your husband.

581
00:54:43,699 --> 00:54:46,410
I'm the only father Teddy and Emily have.

582
00:54:46,994 --> 00:54:52,040
I'm willing to forgive you
for whatever happened in the past.

583
00:54:54,084 --> 00:54:57,129
For whatever you felt a need to do.

584
00:54:57,754 --> 00:55:01,008
I forgive you. And it's time to come home.

585
00:55:15,522 --> 00:55:20,027
To submit yourself to this?
Out of what, spite?

586
00:55:21,612 --> 00:55:23,030
It doesn't make sense.

587
00:55:25,407 --> 00:55:29,995
Your life is with me.
You're spoiled for anything else.

588
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:34,500
You need to ask yourself
how much you're willing to sacrifice

589
00:55:34,583 --> 00:55:38,170
just to prove some point
that doesn't matter to anyone.

590
00:55:54,978 --> 00:55:58,232
Nobody's watching now. Nobody's judging.

591
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:02,986
Take this for the children.

592
00:56:04,363 --> 00:56:07,241
Or take it for yourself.
You don't have to pretend with me.

593
00:56:07,783 --> 00:56:11,411
Take it and decide later.

594
00:56:12,621 --> 00:56:17,167
This is only money. It doesn't mean anything.

595
00:56:22,339 --> 00:56:23,966
Yes, it does.

596
00:57:26,528 --> 00:57:27,821
Say.

597
00:57:28,655 --> 00:57:31,033
Say, you're Nucky Thompson, aren't you?
