1
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:22,650
-You wanna get somethin' to eat?
-Nah.

2
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:24,882
I had somethin' last night,
ruined my appetite.

3
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,890
Besides, I gotta get down the road.

4
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,427
Okay. Thanks for the ride.

5
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:40,667
Come on, I'll buy you
a cup of tea and a bromo.

6
00:02:41,873 --> 00:02:45,070
-Come on.
-Okay, but I can only stay a minute.

7
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,900
Good.

8
00:02:57,122 --> 00:03:00,216
Okay, we open. Come in.

9
00:03:00,726 --> 00:03:03,160
-Where's the john at?
-In the back.

10
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:06,897
Gimme a bromo for my friend here.

11
00:03:06,965 --> 00:03:08,990
I'll take a small steak,
two eggs on top...

12
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:11,467
...some fries, juice,
and a side order of toast...

13
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:14,301
Yes, sure. Right away.

14
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:19,301
Look out for that stomach, huh?

15
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,968
Here we fix you up one second.
You'll feel much better.

16
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:01,742
Okay. See you, huh?

17
00:04:12,364 --> 00:04:14,594
We'll have your steak
ready in a minute.

18
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:25,635
Where's my buddy?

19
00:04:25,777 --> 00:04:26,903
Oh, he left.

20
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:28,240
He left?

21
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:31,339
-What are you talkin' about?
-Hey, what's a matter? You okay?

22
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:41,956
The guy drove off on me.
How are you gonna figure that?

23
00:04:44,162 --> 00:04:47,029
Oh, I think your steak's ready.

24
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:55,072
Thank you.

25
00:05:11,456 --> 00:05:12,855
Oh, no!

26
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:16,393
-What?
-He took my wallet.

27
00:05:16,628 --> 00:05:19,188
I left the raincoat in the car and...

28
00:05:19,798 --> 00:05:21,527
I can't even pay you for this.

29
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:31,508
Tell me, where you goin' anyway?

30
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,175
-Down to L.A.
-Why?

31
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,179
I was goin' down for a job.
The whole thing's in the wallet.

32
00:05:38,717 --> 00:05:41,413
-What kind of job?
-Phone number...huh?

33
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,146
Machinist.

34
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:52,330
Eat.

35
00:05:52,397 --> 00:05:55,127
-Hey, thanks a lot.
-Eat, you'll feel better.

36
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,568
I'll be right back.

37
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,397
You watch.

38
00:06:02,507 --> 00:06:04,407
-Watch what?
-You watch.

39
00:06:04,442 --> 00:06:06,569
I find a new guy for the cars.

40
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:13,146
How's food? Good?

41
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:15,342
Very good. Great. Really.

42
00:06:16,922 --> 00:06:19,982
-Nick Papadakis.
-Frank Chambers.

43
00:06:20,258 --> 00:06:21,816
Frank, huh?

44
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,857
You know cars, Frank?

45
00:06:24,262 --> 00:06:25,593
Yeah. Some.

46
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:28,124
I need mechanic.

47
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:30,968
-Here?
-Oh, sure. Station.

48
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:36,166

00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,009
...l got friends down in L.A.

50
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:43,145
I gotta go down in L.A. Thanks.

51
00:06:43,448 --> 00:06:45,643
And the meal, really, it was delicious.

52
00:06:45,717 --> 00:06:47,082
She cook the food.

53
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:54,156
The food...

54
00:06:56,194 --> 00:06:57,786
...delicious.

55
00:07:14,846 --> 00:07:17,838
Tell me somethin', Nick,
just a question...

56
00:07:18,883 --> 00:07:20,976
What would you pay a guy?

57
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:25,685
-Cora, how much we pay last guy?
-Eight dollars.

58
00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:28,215
-And you promised him...
-Eight dollars.

59
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:30,659
Room, board and you say
you like my wife's cooking.

60
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:35,760
-Your wife?
-Oh, sure.

61
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:45,672
Tell you what, Nick.
I got to track my guy down in L.A.

62
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,572
If it don't pan out,
I take you up on it.

63
00:07:50,682 --> 00:07:53,310
Well, okay. If we still got it.

64
00:07:57,989 --> 00:08:01,288
And I'll send you some money
in any case for the breakfast.

65
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,152
-Oh, yeah. Do that.
-Okay. Thanks a lot, Nick.

66
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:10,763
Goodbye, now.

67
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:13,165
Missus.

68
00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:52,276
Be right with you there.

69
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:59,382
Here's a change, 20 cents.
Thank you very much.

70
00:09:00,318 --> 00:09:02,718
What you need, Mr. Papadakis,
is more coverage.

71
00:09:02,787 --> 00:09:04,652
I hadda lass year.

72
00:09:04,722 --> 00:09:06,587
Last year you had fire,
theft, no liability.

73
00:09:06,658 --> 00:09:07,852
So what I need it now for?

74
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:10,019
Well, you should've had it then.

75
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:13,064
Suppose a customer comes in here and
there's a spot of grease on the floor?

76
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:15,126
No, I'm sorry.
There's no grease onna floor.

77
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,533
-No, I'm just sayin' suppose.
-No. You suppose-a something else.

78
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:32,712
-What are you doing here?
-I come lookin' for some hand soap.

79
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:35,844
I don't have any hand soap here.

80
00:09:36,621 --> 00:09:38,953
You got anything in the kitchen
I could use?

81
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:41,115
Go use the station john.

82
00:09:42,427 --> 00:09:44,395
I'd just get it dirty.

83
00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:53,199
I'll tell him to get you some
the next time he goes in.

84
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:56,640
Sorry to bother you.

85
00:10:04,883 --> 00:10:07,044
You want a cup of coffee?

86
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:10,718
Yeah, thanks.

87
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:14,891
A nice place you got here,
Mrs. Papadukis.

88
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:18,095
Papadakis.

89
00:10:19,164 --> 00:10:21,257
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

90
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,099
Papadakis.

91
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:29,329
What are you, Greek or somethin'?

92
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:32,637
What...do I look Greek to you?

93
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,412
No.

94
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:44,516
Thanks.

95
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,619
So...

96
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:52,292
...what do I call ya?

97
00:10:56,434 --> 00:10:58,459
I guess you can call me Cora.

98
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:04,599
A man, every man,
needs to have a home.

99
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:14,379
-You travel, huh?
-Sure.

100
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,251
It's okay.

101
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:19,885
But you know, the time come...

102
00:11:20,858 --> 00:11:22,849
The time come!

103
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:28,594
Close the door, it is windy.

104
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:34,202
Cora, give the man some wine.

105
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:38,639
-It's in the cupboard if he wants it.
-Nice coffee, Missus.

106
00:11:39,744 --> 00:11:41,644
When the times comes...

107
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,143
I used to travel a lot, too.

108
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:46,713
I was a young idiot.

109
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:48,782
I know you...sit down.

110
00:11:50,688 --> 00:11:52,747
I know you travelin' men.

111
00:11:53,491 --> 00:11:54,753
I was, too.

112
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:58,492
Oh, sure. I've been everyplace.
I speak six language.

113
00:11:59,097 --> 00:12:01,930
-No kiddin'.
-Oh, yes, sure.

114
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:05,926
Go get the wine, huh?

115
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:09,701
Ah, language. Watch this.

116
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:19,306
You know what that is?

117
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:21,110
What?

118
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:26,991
You know what it means, that?

119
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,622
No.

120
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:37,101
I know, you never make fun
of a man talk funny.

121
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:40,137
I talk English
better than she talk Greek.

122
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,970
You know, Frank, this-a country...

123
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,644
...there's no...

124
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,878
...there's no...ideas here.

125
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:56,710
Opportunity, oh yes.

126
00:13:04,128 --> 00:13:05,993
There is no happiness.

127
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,563
Frank, Frank come here!
Hurry up! Quick!

128
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,058
Hurry up! Look!
Look at his!

129
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:26,510
Goddamn son of a bitch thief.

130
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:29,839
Here, pick 'em up. Here.

131
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:33,908
-Hold on. You got 'em?
-Where are we goin'?

132
00:14:33,985 --> 00:14:36,078
We go here. Put 'em up on post.

133
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:38,044
You got it?

134
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:43,460
Push. Push.

135
00:14:51,102 --> 00:14:52,501
Know what I'd do, Nick?

136
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:56,271
-I'd get a new one.
-Oh, I get new one, sure.

137
00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:59,172
And that son of a bitch
hang it first time, he pay for it.

138
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:02,212
Neon. Somethin' flashy.
You know what I mean?

139
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:03,645
Bring some business in.

140
00:15:03,714 --> 00:15:05,306
Neon? What's a neon?

141
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:08,784
Neon. You know...

142
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,053
-...them little colored tubes.
-Tubes.

143
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,619
Oh, it's a neon.

144
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:18,162
Yeah, neon...

145
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:22,394
Maybe.

146
00:15:23,968 --> 00:15:26,163
Goddamn, they all try cheat foreigner.

147
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:35,002
Frank, clean up the place.

148
00:15:52,363 --> 00:15:54,763
He say how long he's gonna be gone?

149
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,028
He didn't tell me.

150
00:15:57,101 --> 00:16:00,298
He said he was goin' into town
to get some parts.

151
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:07,536
Smells good in here today.

152
00:16:12,884 --> 00:16:14,818
Is that door locked?

153
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,620
I must've locked it.

154
00:16:30,935 --> 00:16:33,460
That's money down the drain,
isn't it?

155
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:37,032
You could look at it that way,
if you wanted to, yeah.

156
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:42,971
It's not your money, either, is it?

157
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:45,170
No.

158
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,730
Open it.

159
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:10,741
Did you hear me?

160
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,565
Wait a minute!

161
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:21,570
Wait! Get off!

162
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,821
All right, come on!

163
00:18:40,498 --> 00:18:41,829
Come on!

164
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:24,327
I have surprise for you.

165
00:21:26,063 --> 00:21:27,826
Here.

166
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:34,062
What do you think, huh? It's new.

167
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,098
Let's see it.

168
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:46,346
-You like it?
-Nick, it's beautiful. Real silk?

169
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,886
-Yeah, silk.
-For you, huh?

170
00:21:51,155 --> 00:21:54,955
-Where you go?
-I'll be right back.

171
00:22:46,143 --> 00:22:48,703
How'd you get that way?

172
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,444
How're you feelin' tonight, Cora?

173
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,244
Lousy.

174
00:22:54,652 --> 00:22:55,710
Yeah.

175
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,930
Yeah, you missed me.

176
00:23:12,336 --> 00:23:14,497
Cora!

177
00:24:00,451 --> 00:24:02,612
Oh, stupid, I almost forgot.

178
00:24:05,255 --> 00:24:08,486
Like the sign, huh?
I see they make it the way I say.

179
00:24:11,295 --> 00:24:12,762
See you tomorrow, eh?

180
00:24:16,767 --> 00:24:18,792
Yeah, see you later, Nick.

181
00:24:38,555 --> 00:24:39,522
Yeah?

182
00:24:53,037 --> 00:24:55,005
Feel like doin' somethin'?

183
00:24:57,408 --> 00:24:58,773
I'm doin' it.

184
00:25:13,924 --> 00:25:16,324
Do you want some company?

185
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:33,472
Huh? Want some company?

186
00:25:43,287 --> 00:25:45,050
You want to be with me, right?

187
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:48,383
Right?

188
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,886
Yeah.

189
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,022
Good.

190
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:57,961
Go pack a bag, we're goin' to Chicago.

191
00:26:07,945 --> 00:26:10,072
Go pack a bag.

192
00:26:10,147 --> 00:26:12,274
We're goin' to Chicago. Now.

193
00:26:27,664 --> 00:26:31,156
-I used to work near here.
-Get your L.A. Times.

194
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:35,905
-You got a cigarette?
-No.

195
00:26:38,709 --> 00:26:40,472
How much money you got?

196
00:26:40,544 --> 00:26:41,568
$110.

197
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,139
Don't flash it around here. Come on.

198
00:26:49,153 --> 00:26:51,587
Wait a minute. You left your suitcase.

199
00:26:51,622 --> 00:26:54,648
Bus leaving for Los Angeles,
San Diego, Phoenix...

200
00:26:57,161 --> 00:26:59,322
-Want something to eat?
-Sure.

201
00:26:59,663 --> 00:27:01,654
-Yeah.
-I'll be right back.

202
00:27:04,268 --> 00:27:06,133
The next departure will be...

203
00:27:06,236 --> 00:27:08,101
...Los Angeles to Chicago.

204
00:27:13,377 --> 00:27:14,867
Help you, sir?

205
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:27,519
Change, sir. Sir! Change.

206
00:27:27,724 --> 00:27:30,318
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

207
00:27:35,465 --> 00:27:38,457
-I've got 'em all, what do you want?
-You want one?

208
00:27:51,782 --> 00:27:54,012
Okay, new shooter comin' into the game.

209
00:28:04,695 --> 00:28:06,720
All right, guys, four.

210
00:28:06,797 --> 00:28:09,823
I got it. Who wants a hard-ways four?

211
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:12,096
-Two to one.
-Two to one on the hard ways?

212
00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:15,263
Right. You got it.
What about you? Dollar here.

213
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:18,740
Okay, roll 'em. Come on.
Don't touch this money.

214
00:28:18,942 --> 00:28:22,036
-Where does he think he's goin'?
-I don't know.

215
00:28:22,145 --> 00:28:25,672
-Hey, buddy, we ain't got all night.
-Honey, gimme some money.

216
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,478
Come on, we're gettin' lucky.

217
00:28:27,551 --> 00:28:30,019
These guys don't know craps
from wheat or somethin'.

218
00:28:31,888 --> 00:28:33,355
Come on!

219
00:28:34,024 --> 00:28:36,015
No, I'm not giving it to you.

220
00:28:36,426 --> 00:28:38,485
What? No, you don't understand.

221
00:28:38,562 --> 00:28:39,688
I got to cover a bet.

222
00:28:39,763 --> 00:28:42,698
-I can't talk to you about it just now.
-Frank, I can't go out there broke.

223
00:28:42,866 --> 00:28:44,197
What?

224
00:28:44,868 --> 00:28:47,428
What're you doin' out there, anyway?

225
00:28:47,504 --> 00:28:49,995
Will you, for Chrissakes,
just give me some money?

226
00:28:58,148 --> 00:29:00,446
I saved that money.

227
00:29:12,562 --> 00:29:14,427
Two for San Francisco.

228
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:20,133
-What are you doing?
-I'm tradin' these in.

229
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,730
-San Francisco.
-Wait. We're going to Chicago.

230
00:29:22,806 --> 00:29:25,036
Not anymore.
You want to give me some money?

231
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:27,470
-No.
-That's $37 change for you folks.

232
00:29:27,744 --> 00:29:29,234
-I appreciate that.
-Wait.

233
00:29:29,313 --> 00:29:31,372
You told me your friends
were in Chicago.

234
00:29:31,448 --> 00:29:34,849
Hey, I got friends in Chicago.
I got friends in Duluth.

235
00:29:36,353 --> 00:29:38,651
Now I'm gonna show you somethin'.
Sit down.

236
00:30:01,445 --> 00:30:03,037
What have I got?

237
00:30:09,252 --> 00:30:11,117
-You got it.
-All right.

238
00:30:13,323 --> 00:30:15,291
Oh, I must've skipped you.

239
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:17,789
-You destroyed me.
-I sure did get lucky.

240
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:20,193
Wait a minute.
Are you leavin' with the money?

241
00:30:21,031 --> 00:30:22,623
Well, I won it.

242
00:30:22,699 --> 00:30:24,894
Hey, mate.
I want a shot to get it back.

243
00:30:25,936 --> 00:30:29,030
Fuck you, Commodore.
I won this money.

244
00:30:31,308 --> 00:30:32,707
All right?

245
00:30:36,613 --> 00:30:38,547
It's all right with me, pal.

246
00:30:40,817 --> 00:30:43,809
-Good meetin' with ya.
-Come on, Jim.

247
00:30:45,055 --> 00:30:47,250
Wait a minute. Let's play.

248
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:58,299
Did you see that good-looking girl
that I was talking to leave here?

249
00:30:59,336 --> 00:31:01,065
No, I don't know where she went.

250
00:31:29,499 --> 00:31:30,864
Okay, you can turn 'em on.

251
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:33,425
I told you we shouldn'a hooked this
up in the rain in the first place.

252
00:31:33,503 --> 00:31:34,868
Finish up, already.

253
00:31:34,938 --> 00:31:36,963
-You check the connections?
-Yes, I checked the connections.

254
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,871
-Did you check the switch?
-I checked the switch.

255
00:31:38,942 --> 00:31:40,375
Well, go check the hookup.

256
00:31:40,444 --> 00:31:43,675
Your boss say, "Sign work both
day and night." I wanna lights on.

257
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,278
-Want a cup of coffee, Nick?
-Turn 'em on.

258
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,576
He's checkin' the hookup.

259
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:50,620
Well, hurry up.
I wanna see lights on.

260
00:31:50,987 --> 00:31:52,284
Turn on.

261
00:31:53,023 --> 00:31:54,957
Where the hell is it, anyhow?

262
00:31:55,192 --> 00:31:58,355
Go around there,
he said it's around to the left.

263
00:32:00,197 --> 00:32:02,859
Yeah, I think I've found it.

264
00:32:29,693 --> 00:32:32,389
He would have found us anyway.

265
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,425
You don't know him, Frank.

266
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:38,093
He would've followed us,
and he would have found us.

267
00:32:38,702 --> 00:32:40,932
Don't lose sleep over it, Cora.
I'm just disappointed.

268
00:32:41,004 --> 00:32:42,995
I thought we had somethin'.

269
00:32:45,275 --> 00:32:47,368
You just don't know what it's like.

270
00:32:48,245 --> 00:32:50,543
Bein' a woman,
trapped in this kind of...

271
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,550
You don't, you don't know.

272
00:32:59,256 --> 00:33:01,224
There's always a way, Cora.

273
00:33:02,993 --> 00:33:04,824
If we stick together.

274
00:33:17,574 --> 00:33:19,371
I didn't know what to do.

275
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:20,498
Cora!

276
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,841
I've got to have you, Frank.

277
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:33,712
If it was just us...

278
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,787
If it was just you and me.

279
00:33:40,463 --> 00:33:43,091
What are you talking about?

280
00:33:45,001 --> 00:33:48,061
I'm getting tired
of what's right and wrong.

281
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:54,408
They hang people for that, Cora.

282
00:33:55,145 --> 00:33:56,976
Cora!

283
00:34:12,796 --> 00:34:14,058
Come here!

284
00:34:38,855 --> 00:34:41,551
Hey, Frank, it look good
from here, uh?

285
00:34:41,758 --> 00:34:44,625
Yeah. It's a hell of an idea you had.

286
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:48,430
Hey, neon, huh? Neon.

287
00:36:08,178 --> 00:36:10,305
All right?

288
00:36:12,982 --> 00:36:15,883
Ah, ring twice for danger.
And the door?

289
00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:21,088
Locked from the inside.

290
00:36:21,224 --> 00:36:23,283
And then down the ladder
and that's it.

291
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,122
-Yeah.
-Okay.

292
00:36:32,402 --> 00:36:34,529
Do you love me, Frank?

293
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,502
Sure.

294
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:44,576
You know I do.

295
00:36:51,955 --> 00:36:54,822
Don't worry about anything, okay?

296
00:36:56,993 --> 00:36:59,291
Don't tell me that.

297
00:40:38,014 --> 00:40:39,447
Evening.

298
00:40:39,816 --> 00:40:41,943
You knew I had to stop here, didn't ya?

299
00:40:44,954 --> 00:40:47,422
She's beautiful.

300
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,924
I come by here all the time.
When'd you put her up?

301
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,954
-Just today.
-Had to be.

302
00:40:55,531 --> 00:40:57,726
What was that?

303
00:40:59,435 --> 00:41:02,336
-There's a damn cat up there.
-Oh, yeah.

304
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:11,043
Hey, they sound a lot like
babies cryin' sometimes, don't they?

305
00:41:11,948 --> 00:41:14,143
Yes, they do.

306
00:41:20,223 --> 00:41:22,691
Well, I expect I ought to
get back to work.

307
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,490
Yeah, well, we all got to sometime,
that's for sure.

308
00:41:26,562 --> 00:41:28,826
That's for sure. Take care now.

309
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:31,229
Yeah, I'll do that.

310
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:49,448
Frank, get over here!

311
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,249
Oh, my God!

312
00:41:55,691 --> 00:41:57,556
What happened to the light?

313
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:02,463
I hit him! I hit him!

314
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:07,830
-What happened?
-I hit him and all the lights went out!

315
00:42:08,571 --> 00:42:11,233
Get on the phone. Call an ambulance.
The cop came by and saw everything.

316
00:42:11,307 --> 00:42:14,208
-The cop? What cop?
-Get on the phone!

317
00:42:15,611 --> 00:42:17,545
We're gonna die for this!

318
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,217
Hello, Nick.

319
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,086
Nick, wake up.

320
00:42:44,707 --> 00:42:47,676
Come on, Nick. Come on, Nick.

321
00:42:52,215 --> 00:42:53,705
Nick, wake up.

322
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:58,549
We'll know for sure
after we see the tests.

323
00:42:58,621 --> 00:43:01,215
It'll be about a week.
All of a week.

324
00:43:08,064 --> 00:43:10,692
Can I have the book, please?

325
00:43:16,772 --> 00:43:17,761
Thanks.

326
00:43:25,515 --> 00:43:27,915
All he knows, it went dark.

327
00:43:32,221 --> 00:43:35,315
If he'd have turned around, Frank,
they'd have hanged us for it.

328
00:43:44,033 --> 00:43:47,662
And something,
something put that cop there.

329
00:43:50,907 --> 00:43:53,774
It's an act of God,
those lights went out.

330
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,604
Don't look back.

331
00:44:00,683 --> 00:44:03,413
-What?
-Don't look back. It's a cop.

332
00:44:05,321 --> 00:44:08,154
-His red light's on.
-Oh, God.

333
00:44:09,392 --> 00:44:11,860
No, no, leave 'em on.

334
00:44:15,064 --> 00:44:16,827
Bathroom upstairs?

335
00:44:17,733 --> 00:44:18,927
Ah, yeah.

336
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:24,767
What's the ladder doin' there?

337
00:44:26,175 --> 00:44:28,336
I don't know.

338
00:44:29,845 --> 00:44:31,369
Hey, come here.

339
00:44:32,782 --> 00:44:34,181
All right. Sure.

340
00:44:52,735 --> 00:44:53,702
Hey.

341
00:44:57,473 --> 00:44:59,873
Cover's off this fuse box up here.

342
00:45:00,409 --> 00:45:03,674
I'd say that sucker stuck a paw in it.
Fried him deader than hell.

343
00:45:03,946 --> 00:45:05,914
Yeah. How about that?

344
00:45:06,249 --> 00:45:09,582
Must've been those guys
that were workin' on the sign today.

345
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:11,417
Yeah.

346
00:45:13,489 --> 00:45:14,979
Sounds like that.

347
00:45:21,097 --> 00:45:23,224
Sorry about your husband, ma'am.

348
00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:24,959
Thank you.

349
00:45:28,004 --> 00:45:30,165
Thanks a lot.

350
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:43,475
I'll get a flashlight.

351
00:46:38,007 --> 00:46:41,101
I know it's tough...to go down
and see him.

352
00:46:49,952 --> 00:46:52,944
You're sure you don't want
me to drive?

353
00:46:59,695 --> 00:47:01,287
Hurry back.

354
00:47:59,822 --> 00:48:02,791
Take it easy guys, there's plenty here.

355
00:48:08,097 --> 00:48:10,657
Cut pie. Little portions.

356
00:49:06,388 --> 00:49:08,652
John Philip Sousa.

357
00:49:40,923 --> 00:49:43,915
I don't want to make love tonight.

358
00:49:58,807 --> 00:50:00,536
It's our last night.

359
00:50:01,277 --> 00:50:02,505
I know.

360
00:50:04,046 --> 00:50:06,674
I don't want to make love.

361
00:50:15,858 --> 00:50:18,190
Yeah, you're right.

362
00:50:20,262 --> 00:50:22,423
Me neither.

363
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:45,151
Oh, Christ, Cora.

364
00:51:39,708 --> 00:51:41,972
It's all in the feet.
You must watch the feet.

365
00:51:43,445 --> 00:51:46,278
-Can I talk to you a minute?
-It is beautiful, believe me.

366
00:51:46,315 --> 00:51:48,943
-You just watch your feet...
-Can I talk to you for a minute?

367
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:51,312
-And you will learn...
-Excuse me.

368
00:51:58,327 --> 00:52:00,090
I can't talk about it now.

369
00:52:00,195 --> 00:52:02,561
What do you mean,
you can't talk about it now?

370
00:52:02,598 --> 00:52:05,089
Four days already,
you can't talk about it.

371
00:52:07,536 --> 00:52:10,266
Yeah, and you don't understand.

372
00:52:11,674 --> 00:52:14,472
I can't do it anymore, Frank.
You understand?

373
00:52:14,677 --> 00:52:16,076
Why can't you do it anymore?

374
00:52:16,145 --> 00:52:19,171
What does that mean?
You can't do it anymore?

375
00:52:38,634 --> 00:52:41,102
-It's over.
-Come dance.

376
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:44,537
What? What are you talkin' about?

377
00:53:34,656 --> 00:53:36,248
Bravo, Nicko.

378
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,621
Come here.

379
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:22,664
Come here.

380
00:54:32,514 --> 00:54:35,449
This man saved my life.
I'm fond this man.

381
00:54:56,705 --> 00:54:59,299
Cora, my feets, you know.

382
00:55:05,681 --> 00:55:08,479
My feets. They're beautiful, huh?

383
00:55:10,152 --> 00:55:12,416
-Beautiful.
-You say it.

384
00:55:12,688 --> 00:55:14,417
You say it Greek.

385
00:55:17,192 --> 00:55:19,285
Nick, I can't say it in Greek.

386
00:55:25,868 --> 00:55:27,699
Come on, you say it.

387
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:36,674
Say it.

388
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:45,209
That's it.

389
00:56:04,406 --> 00:56:07,398
Come here. Now, you say it.
Is beautiful.

390
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:12,903
Tonight.

391
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:14,905
What?

392
00:56:17,753 --> 00:56:19,084
What?

393
00:56:55,357 --> 00:56:57,018
What're you doing?

394
00:56:58,093 --> 00:56:59,583
You're the guy's wife, Cora.

395
00:56:59,661 --> 00:57:01,925
You told me that.

396
00:57:03,865 --> 00:57:06,265
You were gonna leave me?

397
00:57:08,937 --> 00:57:12,100
-I was writing you a note.
-Were you writing me a thank-you note?

398
00:57:14,376 --> 00:57:17,243
-Is that what you were doing?
-Cora, look.

399
00:57:17,713 --> 00:57:18,805
Live here.

400
00:57:19,047 --> 00:57:21,311
Live with the guy.

401
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,275
Took a chance, we didn't make it.

402
00:57:24,519 --> 00:57:26,248
Live with the man.

403
00:57:27,689 --> 00:57:30,487
He wants to have a baby.
You understand?

404
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:34,462
He's changed.

405
00:57:34,997 --> 00:57:38,455
He says the accident changed him
and now I'm supposed to have his kid.

406
00:57:44,139 --> 00:57:46,835
How am I gonna do that, Frank?

407
00:57:57,853 --> 00:58:00,651
How am I supposed to have his baby?

408
00:58:01,423 --> 00:58:03,857
I can't have his baby.

409
00:58:05,727 --> 00:58:08,594
The only one I could have
a baby by is you.

410
00:58:13,468 --> 00:58:14,696
Okay.

411
00:58:23,278 --> 00:58:26,042
Say you won't leave me. Please.

412
00:58:27,449 --> 00:58:29,440
Just stall him, babe.

413
00:58:30,619 --> 00:58:32,314
Just stall him.

414
00:58:50,872 --> 00:58:53,898
-Going far?
-We're goin' to Ventura.

415
00:58:54,509 --> 00:58:56,909
A trip. A change of scene.

416
00:58:58,814 --> 00:59:02,341
-Is it much farther?
-It's a couple of hours.

417
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:07,986
-That's it.
-What do I owe ya?

418
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:11,120
$1.44.

419
00:59:13,495 --> 00:59:16,726
-Okay. Here you go.
-Be right back.

420
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:36,084
-Here's your change.
-I'm gonna drive now.

421
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:41,282
You can't even walk.
What are you talkin' about, drivin'?

422
00:59:41,556 --> 00:59:43,490
-Now, get in the back.
-What?

423
00:59:43,558 --> 00:59:45,890
-Get in the back.
-Are you nuts? Are you nutty?

424
00:59:45,961 --> 00:59:47,929
-Mister, you don't want to--
-I'm drivin' this car home.

425
00:59:47,996 --> 00:59:49,725
-Come on, Frank.
-You don't want to drive tonight.

426
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:53,564
-You don't want to drive tonight.
-What, do you own this car, big fella?

427
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:56,968
-Get in the back.
-Just get in the back.

428
01:00:07,716 --> 01:00:09,479
That's it.

429
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:11,979
You drive safely now, okay?
Goodnight.

430
01:00:24,933 --> 01:00:26,992
-Good wine.
-C'mon, Nick.

431
01:00:31,606 --> 01:00:33,631
Is nothing like to have a wife.

432
01:00:41,082 --> 01:00:44,643
-Cut it out, Nick.
-Don't worry. He's drunk.

433
01:00:57,499 --> 01:01:00,730
-Shit!
-Don't talk like that.

434
01:01:01,436 --> 01:01:04,405
It's boiling over, Nick.
I gotta pull over.

435
01:01:22,224 --> 01:01:24,317
Hey, wake 'im up.

436
01:01:41,943 --> 01:01:44,411
Wake up. The car's stopped.

437
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,114
Come on, wake up.
You gotta fix it.

438
01:01:50,452 --> 01:01:52,579
Frank, get out of the car.

439
01:02:06,368 --> 01:02:07,733
Shit.

440
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:10,465
I'll fix it myself.

441
01:02:14,509 --> 01:02:17,137
What's a matter...with door?

442
01:02:22,017 --> 01:02:23,609
There, got it...

443
01:02:32,294 --> 01:02:34,262
Is he dead?

444
01:02:44,139 --> 01:02:45,128
Get in!

445
01:02:47,709 --> 01:02:50,075
Come on, Cora, get in.

446
01:02:58,687 --> 01:03:00,120
Drive.

447
01:03:15,136 --> 01:03:17,502
Put it in neutral.

448
01:03:30,151 --> 01:03:31,140
Wait.
