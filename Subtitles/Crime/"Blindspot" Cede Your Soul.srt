00:00:01,165 --> 00:00:03,633
<i>Previously on "Blindspot"...</i>

2
00:00:04,294 --> 00:00:06,163
I see the way
that you look at me,

3
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:09,489
and I don't know how to be
this person that you lost.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,380
I know you want Jane
to be Taylor Shaw...

5
00:00:11,414 --> 00:00:14,070
Look, this has nothing
to do with what I want.

6
00:00:14,135 --> 00:00:16,256
Dad's been accused of kidnapping
her, of killing her.

7
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:17,468
Hello, son.

8
00:00:17,557 --> 00:00:18,786
Saul Guerrero.

9
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:21,137
You're listed as
the case officer.

10
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,202
Let's talk about
Jane Doe.

11
00:00:23,754 --> 00:00:25,370
I know being Taylor

12
00:00:25,405 --> 00:00:27,788
might not be an answer to
all of your problems.

13
00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:29,275
It's a starting point.

14
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,597
I think you're wrong.

15
00:00:30,632 --> 00:00:33,817
You... you're
my starting point.

16
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:21,745
Okay, got your stuff.

17
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:24,533
Clothes, toothbrush.

18
00:01:25,593 --> 00:01:26,820
You slept here?

19
00:01:26,855 --> 00:01:27,975
Yeah.

20
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,201
Okay, look.

21
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:33,676
I know I shouldn't
have brought Dad

22
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,629
into your home
without asking.

23
00:01:35,903 --> 00:01:38,271
But I know if I asked,
you would've said no.

24
00:01:38,346 --> 00:01:39,948
Which is why you
shouldn't have done it.

25
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:42,841
You could have at least,
you know, shaken his hand

26
00:01:42,877 --> 00:01:44,189
or said hi.

27
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:45,731
I won't talk
about this here.

28
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:47,650
Well, when do you wanna
talk about it, Kurt?

29
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:50,661
Taylor is alive,
Dad is innocent.

30
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:52,686
Her being back does
not change the fact

31
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:54,280
that someone
kidnapped her.

32
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,426
So, then talk me
through your version.

33
00:01:56,462 --> 00:01:58,075
What, he got off
his shift, he abducted

34
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,548
the five-year-old
girl next door,

35
00:01:59,582 --> 00:02:01,061
and then sold her on
the black market and came home

36
00:02:01,096 --> 00:02:03,025
in time for the evening news?
I mean, what?

37
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,643
Someone knows what
happened that night.

38
00:02:04,677 --> 00:02:06,453
It's not you
and it's not me.

39
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:08,520
So you still really
think he did it?

40
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,450
Or have you just been
mad at him so long,

41
00:02:10,487 --> 00:02:11,807
you don't know
how to stop?

42
00:02:11,842 --> 00:02:13,509
I want him gone by
the time I get home.

43
00:02:13,578 --> 00:02:14,711
Okay, well, you don't
need to worry about it

44
00:02:14,778 --> 00:02:16,262
'cause he's already
at a hotel.

45
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:18,615
He's just here
for some treatments.

46
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:21,617
He's still trying
to beat it?

47
00:02:21,686 --> 00:02:24,086
No, Kurt.

48
00:02:24,155 --> 00:02:26,590
They're just trying
to slow it down.

49
00:02:30,762 --> 00:02:32,829
I gotta get
back to work.

50
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:34,865
Thanks for the clothes.

51
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:53,979
What am I about to say?

52
00:02:54,014 --> 00:02:57,054
"Three days are up.
Where's your cash?"

53
00:02:57,121 --> 00:02:58,626
I'm working on it.

54
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:01,510
Oh, no, come on.

55
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:03,659
Don't make me
be this guy,

56
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:06,163
walking in here,
you know, talking about

57
00:03:06,198 --> 00:03:08,431
breaking legs
or worse.

58
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:10,135
Ow!
Ah, ah!

59
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,387
Do you know what
I do for a living?

60
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:14,236
Yeah, I do.
And what's the FBI's stance

61
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:15,806
on agents with illegal
gambling debts?

62
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:17,841
What, you're gonna tell on me?
You're my bookie.

63
00:03:17,877 --> 00:03:19,699
I'm saying, you don't pay,
it's out of my hands.

64
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:21,824
My bosses do what they do
to protect their reputation.

65
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,691
You wanna let go
of my arm now?!

66
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:24,914
Oww!

67
00:03:27,384 --> 00:03:29,088
That's a bad play, Tash.

68
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:30,868
One more day,
I'll have your money.

69
00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:32,257
You better,
'cause the next time,

70
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:34,743
the conversation
ends different.

71
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:43,836
A breakthrough?
It was a dream.

72
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:45,031
Your first dream,

73
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:46,530
which you considered
significant enough

74
00:03:46,564 --> 00:03:47,903
to mention to me.

75
00:03:47,972 --> 00:03:49,573
A sex dream.

76
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:53,399
So what does it mean?

77
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,777
Well, that depends
on who you ask.

78
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:56,561
Most people believe that
dreams are the brain's way

79
00:03:56,596 --> 00:03:59,598
of processing how we
feel about things.

80
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:01,352
So, who do you
think he was,

81
00:04:01,387 --> 00:04:02,953
this dream man?

82
00:04:05,043 --> 00:04:08,211
Um, something tells me
you have a theory.

83
00:04:09,477 --> 00:04:11,068
What, you think
it's Weller?

84
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:13,663
You said that,
not me.

85
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,526
I hear you had
Jane over for dinner.

86
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,422
Yeah, it was
my sister's idea.

87
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:21,589
How worried
do I have to be

88
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,408
about your objectivity
on this case?

89
00:04:24,444 --> 00:04:27,014
You don't.
It was a family dinner.

90
00:04:27,048 --> 00:04:29,016
I mean, my nephew
was there, it was...

91
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:30,504
there was nothing
inappropriate.

92
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:34,134
No.
No, I ju... no, I...

93
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,817
That guy had a tattoo
of a tree on his arm,

94
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:39,161
and Weller
doesn't have that.

95
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:41,761
Dreams aren't literal,
they're impressionistic.

96
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:43,396
Your body is covered
in tattoos,

97
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,896
symbols you
don't understand.

98
00:04:45,963 --> 00:04:49,163
Now, you described it
as a tree with deep roots.

99
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,247
Maybe you're searching
for stability, strength.

100
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:53,240
Those are certainly
qualities

101
00:04:53,274 --> 00:04:54,999
that Agent Weller
seems to project.

102
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:56,331
I'm speaking generally.

103
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:58,478
Normally your judgment
is beyond reproach.

104
00:04:58,514 --> 00:04:59,550
But with her?

105
00:04:59,586 --> 00:05:02,562
Look, we all know this
is an unusual situation.

106
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:04,341
Which is why
I need to know

107
00:05:04,377 --> 00:05:06,163
that you're rock solid
out there,

108
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,038
that you're seeing
things clearly.

109
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:10,372
I am.

110
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:12,262
I'm saying you're not.

111
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:13,740
Your relationship
with Agent Weller

112
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:16,262
is... complicated.

113
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:18,404
He's your colleague,
your protector,

114
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,846
your childhood friend.

115
00:05:19,882 --> 00:05:23,031
Yeah, and now he's in
my dreams. He's everywhere.

116
00:05:23,065 --> 00:05:25,031
I think we need to
consider you stepping down

117
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:27,199
as lead agent
on this case.

118
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:29,605
It's not necessary.

119
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,113
Maybe you need to establish
clearer boundaries.

120
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:33,194
How do I do that?

121
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,454
To start...

122
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,875
try keeping your
interactions with him

123
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:38,273
limited to
a professional context.

124
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:40,425
At least for now.

125
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:41,656
Right.

126
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:46,689
Mornin'.

127
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:48,038
Hey.

128
00:05:49,622 --> 00:05:51,658
Your holster's in
the wrong position again.

129
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,560
Right, sorry.

130
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:56,584
There's just so much new
stuff for me to remember.

131
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,466
We've already
talked about this.

132
00:05:58,502 --> 00:05:59,245
If we're in a firefight

133
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,699
and your gun's
in the wrong position,

134
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,682
that mistake could cost
someone their life.

135
00:06:02,716 --> 00:06:04,250
I said I was sorry, okay?

136
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:05,471
I don't need an apology.

137
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:07,341
I just need you
to make that adjustment.

138
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:18,182
Falcon is two minutes out.

139
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:20,699
Switch to alternate route
Bravo-three.

140
00:06:29,685 --> 00:06:31,019
Everybody down!

141
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:36,514
No! No!

142
00:06:37,317 --> 00:06:38,683
Oh, oh, God!

143
00:06:50,692 --> 00:06:52,060
Uhh!

144
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,576
The target was Saudi Prince
Fawwaz al Aziz.

145
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,348
He was in town
on a peace summit.

146
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,569
There's been a lot of chatter
about Saudi extremist groups

147
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:06,925
targeting the Royal family.

148
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:08,737
Secret Service routes
are classified.

149
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:10,141
They tend to
change the day of.

150
00:07:10,175 --> 00:07:12,481
So how did these guys pull off
an attack this coordinated?

151
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:14,442
Because they had this.

152
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:15,588
One of the shooters
had a mobile app

153
00:07:15,622 --> 00:07:18,180
that I'd never heard of
called TRAKZER.

154
00:07:18,216 --> 00:07:20,610
It hacks into the GPS signals
from "Blue Force trackers"

155
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:24,444
on government vehicles and
maps their exact location.

156
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,262
Where'd they get this
and who else has it?

157
00:07:26,298 --> 00:07:27,939
The transactions
are untraceable.

158
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:29,608
Probably done through
the Dark Web.

159
00:07:29,643 --> 00:07:31,540
The Dark Web?

160
00:07:31,574 --> 00:07:33,011
That doesn't sound good,
what is that?

161
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:34,865
95% of the Internet
isn't indexed

162
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:36,692
on commercial
search engines.

163
00:07:36,726 --> 00:07:38,274
Yeah, the Dark Web
is like the Wild West.

164
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:40,675
Everything from weapons
to sex trafficking.

165
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:41,952
Yeah, and now,
assassinations.

166
00:07:41,987 --> 00:07:43,930
Shouldn't we hand this over
to the Cyber Division?

167
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:46,153
Here, take a look
at the app's logo.

168
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:50,326
That owl's on my leg.

169
00:07:50,362 --> 00:07:51,552
Exactly.

170
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:53,581
So, whoever did this
to her knew about the app?

171
00:07:53,617 --> 00:07:56,466
How many government vehicles
have these trackers?

172
00:07:56,502 --> 00:07:57,968
All of them.

173
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:01,146
So every single
government agent

174
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,701
is now a potential target...
including us.

175
00:08:14,678 --> 00:08:19,678
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

176
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:28,156
Last month, two undercover
LAPD cops got executed

177
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,500
in their unmarked car
by converging vehicles.

178
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:32,971
No one could figure out how
they coordinated the attacks.

179
00:08:33,006 --> 00:08:34,383
They tracked
their patrol car.

180
00:08:34,451 --> 00:08:36,301
More variations
on the same theme.

181
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:38,921
An ambush in a prison bus
convoy in Houston.

182
00:08:38,956 --> 00:08:40,578
A federal witness
killed in D.C.

183
00:08:40,614 --> 00:08:42,017
TRAKZER's gone national.

184
00:08:42,052 --> 00:08:43,687
And the death toll's rising.

185
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:45,461
We gotta shut
this down fast.

186
00:08:47,397 --> 00:08:48,998
Whoever wrote this app
made it look like

187
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:51,028
it's being hosted
by a government network.

188
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:52,534
Any attack that
we launch on it

189
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,975
would be hitting
our own systems.

190
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,164
Great.

191
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,418
So, shutting
this thing down

192
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,539
is like trying to find
a needle in a haystack.

193
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:01,339
No, it's like finding a piece
of hay in a haystack,

194
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,855
like a very
specific piece of hay

195
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:04,902
- in the haystack.
- Yeah.

196
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:06,383
Okay, well,
you totally get it.

197
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:07,783
Yeah.

198
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,576
Actually...

199
00:09:09,611 --> 00:09:11,586
Wait a second,
I have an idea.

200
00:09:11,654 --> 00:09:14,289
I checked the signature elements
in TRAKZER's source code

201
00:09:14,357 --> 00:09:16,591
against our malware database.

202
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,684
I understood
the word "database."

203
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,720
Each programmer has a...
a distinctive coding style.

204
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:23,442
- Like a fingerprint.
- Exactly.

205
00:09:23,477 --> 00:09:25,418
And fingerprints
from the software

206
00:09:25,453 --> 00:09:27,110
match a recent
Hackathon winner.

207
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:29,884
Sponsored contests for
recruiting programmers.

208
00:09:29,918 --> 00:09:32,086
Now, check out
the winner's username.

209
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,307
The Horned Owl.

210
00:09:35,462 --> 00:09:37,865
That's our guy.
How do we find him?

211
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,472
I traced the P.O. Box
on his Hackathon entry form,

212
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:42,951
and it routes to an
apartment in Bed-Stuy.

213
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:44,456
Hay in a haystack.

214
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:46,823
Nice work.
Let's go get him.

215
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:09,273
No.
Reade, you're up.

216
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,668
Bust it.

217
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:15,765
<i>♪ Hey! Hey! Hey! ♪</i>

218
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:17,351
FBI, show me your hands!

219
00:10:17,386 --> 00:10:18,038
- What's going...
- Put your hands up!

220
00:10:18,072 --> 00:10:19,743
What's going on?!

221
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:20,956
Clear.

222
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:21,892
Clear.

223
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:23,298
Turn the music off!

224
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,594
Turn it off!

225
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:25,705
Does anyone else
live here?

226
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,263
No, what is this?

227
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:28,931
That owl on the door...

228
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:30,075
that symbol,
is that you?

229
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,956
- Yes.
- You created TRAKZER?

230
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,571
Of course I did.
I created it for you.

231
00:10:36,673 --> 00:10:39,475
I work for the U.S. government.

232
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:47,110
<i>Ana Montes,
I'm Special Agent Zapata.</i>

233
00:10:47,506 --> 00:10:48,580
<i>I'm not saying anything</i>

234
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,540
<i>unless it's my direct
point of contact.</i>

235
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:54,837
Right... and that's...

236
00:10:54,873 --> 00:10:58,147
Leonard Gail,
National Security Agency,

237
00:10:58,182 --> 00:11:01,059
Information Systems
and Security Division.

238
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:02,847
And you do what
for the NSA, exactly?

239
00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:05,066
Nothing you're cleared
to hear about.

240
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,837
Just have your boss
call Leonard Gail.

241
00:11:09,518 --> 00:11:11,153
_

242
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:14,062
_

243
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,537
_

244
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,789
Okay, so because my
last name is Montes,

245
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:22,159
you think
I speak Spanish?

246
00:11:22,451 --> 00:11:24,438
I read your
Social Services file.

247
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:26,167
I know your parents
passed away,

248
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:29,357
and I am sorry
to hear that.

249
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,639
I get it.

250
00:11:32,673 --> 00:11:33,706
My dad left
when I was five,

251
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,297
my mom was an alcoholic.

252
00:11:35,331 --> 00:11:38,234
My brothers and I practically
raised each other.

253
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:40,491
_

254
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:43,082
_

255
00:11:43,438 --> 00:11:44,783
_

256
00:11:53,638 --> 00:11:55,024
I hate teenage girls.

257
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:57,452
I'm gonna go get Weller.
Stay here.

258
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,716
What part of
"I'm not talking"

259
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,452
don't you people
understand?

260
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,570
What is this?

261
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:21,900
Where did you
get that?

262
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:22,741
I don't know.

263
00:12:22,777 --> 00:12:24,293
It's on your leg
and you don't know?

264
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:25,947
Look, it's hard
to explain.

265
00:12:25,982 --> 00:12:28,918
Please, can you just
tell me what it is?

266
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:31,820
She got a healthy imagination,
I'll give her that.

267
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:33,344
She could be
telling the truth.

268
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:34,690
I mean, federal agencies
hire hackers

269
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:36,393
to red-team them all the time,
it's how they find

270
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:38,393
the vulnerabilities
in their security systems.

271
00:12:38,427 --> 00:12:39,905
She's 17.

272
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:41,719
Yeah, for a hacker,
she's in her prime.

273
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:44,892
I just spoke to my
NSA counterpart.

274
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,778
Leonard Gail
doesn't exist.

275
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:47,894
I knew she was lying.

276
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:49,894
Or, Leonard Gail does exist

277
00:12:49,928 --> 00:12:51,846
and the NSA is lying,
like they've lied

278
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:53,857
to everyone about
everything ever.

279
00:12:53,893 --> 00:12:55,777
Well, what does
your gut tell you?

280
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:57,451
Are we dealing with
a government agent

281
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,697
or a kid who's read
too many spy novels?

282
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,985
What if it's neither?

283
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:06,557
So, the owl is just
a personal thing?

284
00:13:06,615 --> 00:13:08,187
It didn't come
from anywhere else?

285
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:11,168
Because we can't find it
referenced anywhere.

286
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:13,995
Did you design it?

287
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:15,630
No.

288
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,019
Well, do you
know who did?

289
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,099
My brother.

290
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:28,342
I saw in your file that
he was killed last year.

291
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,613
I'm sorry.

292
00:13:31,147 --> 00:13:33,610
Do you live
alone now?

293
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,552
Me, too.

294
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,823
It's hard,
all that quiet.

295
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:43,959
I'm used to it.

296
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:46,038
I'm not.

297
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:51,933
My brother was older.

298
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:55,471
He mostly worked nights.
I was alone a lot.

299
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:58,657
So he drew that
owl above my bed,

300
00:13:58,692 --> 00:14:00,442
so I wouldn't be scared.

301
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:03,571
That thing was supposed
to make you <i>less</i> scared?

302
00:14:06,548 --> 00:14:08,283
Well, owls are nocturnal,

303
00:14:08,318 --> 00:14:11,005
so he said it would
keep away the bad guys.

304
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,788
Did it work?

305
00:14:13,072 --> 00:14:14,238
No.

306
00:14:17,085 --> 00:14:19,695
Your brother sounds
pretty special.

307
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:24,073
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

308
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:28,990
Did you talk
to Leonard Gail?

309
00:14:31,206 --> 00:14:32,673
What did he say?

310
00:14:33,764 --> 00:14:36,044
We talked to the NSA.

311
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:37,682
He doesn't exist.

312
00:14:37,898 --> 00:14:39,368
You're saying
I'm a liar?

313
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:41,729
No, I'm saying that
you were probably conned

314
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:43,893
by someone who claims
they work for the NSA.

315
00:14:43,927 --> 00:14:45,471
Of course the NSA

316
00:14:45,506 --> 00:14:46,691
told you that Leonard
doesn't exist.

317
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:49,405
His job is like 100 levels
above your clearance.

318
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:54,254
Look at these.

319
00:14:57,692 --> 00:15:02,565
They're recent crimes targeted
at government vehicles...

320
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,327
which were located
by your software.

321
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:09,438
No.

322
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:10,802
Yes.

323
00:15:10,836 --> 00:15:13,642
No, my... my software
isn't real.

324
00:15:13,677 --> 00:15:15,147
It was just
a proof of concept.

325
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:17,005
It wasn't for people
to actually use.

326
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,700
Well, "people" are using it.

327
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,364
Did you ever meet
Leonard Gail in person?

328
00:15:26,585 --> 00:15:27,831
No.

329
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:30,740
You didn't give your
software to the good guys.

330
00:15:30,775 --> 00:15:32,790
You gave it to someone
very dangerous.

331
00:15:32,826 --> 00:15:34,260
And every second
it's out there,

332
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:36,475
more lives are at risk.

333
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,477
People are dying, Ana.

334
00:15:38,513 --> 00:15:40,126
Oh, my God.

335
00:15:40,162 --> 00:15:43,576
Ana, we need you to get
this software offline.

336
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,918
- I can't.
- You have to.

337
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:47,274
No, you don't understand.

338
00:15:47,308 --> 00:15:49,744
There's no way for me
to shut it down.

339
00:15:57,735 --> 00:15:59,484
What do you mean
you can't shut it down?

340
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,538
Look, TRAKZER isn't
on my servers.

341
00:16:02,573 --> 00:16:03,938
It's on Shawn's.

342
00:16:03,974 --> 00:16:05,320
Who is Shawn?

343
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:06,879
Shawn Palmer.

344
00:16:06,913 --> 00:16:08,562
He approached me online
a few months ago.

345
00:16:08,597 --> 00:16:11,173
He said that he was
hiring freelancers

346
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,331
for his cyber
security firm.

347
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:15,936
So, I did a few projects
for him and then he said

348
00:16:15,971 --> 00:16:17,063
he wanted to meet
me in person,

349
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:18,668
that he had this
big opportunity.

350
00:16:18,703 --> 00:16:20,100
All right,
so he was the guy

351
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:21,864
that said he worked
for the NSA.

352
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,159
Yes, and other,
less-reputable businesses.

353
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:27,230
Look, he said the NSA
wanted to test

354
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:28,846
their GPS security,

355
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:30,846
and he told them that
if I couldn't break in,

356
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:32,344
that nobody could.

357
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:34,932
He promised that they'd
hook me up with a job after

358
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:37,602
if I pulled it off.
So, I wrote the code

359
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:39,893
and then he sent it
to his contact.

360
00:16:39,927 --> 00:16:42,674
Leonard Gail.

361
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,730
You didn't check
into Shawn's story?

362
00:16:44,765 --> 00:16:48,067
I thought he was
looking out for me.

363
00:16:48,126 --> 00:16:48,854
I guess I just...

364
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:51,702
Wanted it to be true.

365
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:52,754
Listen to me.

366
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:54,375
The longer this
is out there,

367
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:57,577
the more people are
gonna get hurt or die.

368
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:02,399
We need your help
to get to Shawn Palmer.

369
00:17:05,086 --> 00:17:06,441
What do you need?

370
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:08,357
Palmer's security firm
is a front.

371
00:17:08,393 --> 00:17:11,102
Outstanding warrants for
unauthorized computer access,

372
00:17:11,136 --> 00:17:13,411
wire fraud,
identity theft.

373
00:17:13,445 --> 00:17:15,326
And, ladies,
he is single.

374
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:17,355
And invisible...
Cyber Division couldn't even

375
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:18,958
find a photo, let alone
an address.

376
00:17:18,992 --> 00:17:20,434
I could find his username

377
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,001
with DARPA's
Deep Web crawler,

378
00:17:22,037 --> 00:17:24,126
or track his Bitcoin usage
in the Blockchain.

379
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,019
Or Ana could just
tell us where he lives.

380
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:27,147
She's been to his house.

381
00:17:27,182 --> 00:17:29,233
Oh, sure, I mean, it's
a little analog, but...

382
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:30,491
All right, let's go

383
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:32,721
get Mr. Palmer and bring
him in for a chat.

384
00:17:32,756 --> 00:17:34,534
Wait, wait, wait, guys,
it's not that easy.

385
00:17:34,568 --> 00:17:37,229
Shawn's place is like this
crazy, fortified smart-home.

386
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:38,913
He keeps his
servers there.

387
00:17:38,949 --> 00:17:40,650
The guy literally
never leaves.

388
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,291
Fine, we break
down his door.

389
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:44,628
No, a guy like Palmer
has an eject button.

390
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,093
He sees law enforcement
coming, he's gonna take

391
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:48,345
- the software open source.
- Open source?

392
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,807
Meaning he'll put TRAKZER's
code online for free.

393
00:17:50,842 --> 00:17:52,414
This thing could go
viral in hours.

394
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,804
Well, if we can't get in,
let's draw him out.

395
00:17:54,838 --> 00:17:56,869
What, like pull his
fire alarm or something?

396
00:17:56,904 --> 00:17:58,164
No.

397
00:17:58,219 --> 00:18:00,963
The guy is careful, smart
enough to know a false alarm.

398
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:03,009
What if it wasn't
a false alarm?

399
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,708
Reade, Zapata.

400
00:18:06,742 --> 00:18:08,184
<i>Are you in position?</i>

401
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,719
Ready when you are.

402
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:13,007
<i>Patterson, what's our ETA?</i>

403
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:13,992
I need a few more minutes.

404
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:15,503
This guy has
a massive firewall.

405
00:18:15,538 --> 00:18:17,125
Blocked ports,
encrypted traffic,

406
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,327
intrusion detection.

407
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,743
Here, why don't you
try accessing...

408
00:18:19,778 --> 00:18:21,633
Don't touch
my keyboard!

409
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,551
- Okay.
- You are a hacker.

410
00:18:23,586 --> 00:18:26,496
This computer is behind
the FBI firewall.

411
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,103
No way you're
touching this, kid.

412
00:18:28,137 --> 00:18:29,299
Was just gonna suggest
entering through

413
00:18:29,335 --> 00:18:30,894
the emergency cell backup
on his smart-home control...

414
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,104
Yes, and accessing his
cameras and the alarms.

415
00:18:33,138 --> 00:18:35,174
I was just gonna do that,
if you would just...

416
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,319
let me type.

417
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:37,699
Maybe if you were
writing in Python

418
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,445
instead of Perl,
you'd move faster.

419
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,092
- What's wrong with Perl?
- Nothing...

420
00:18:41,126 --> 00:18:43,215
if you're designing
a website in the late '90s.

421
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,019
Whatever.

422
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:47,285
I see you switching.

423
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,686
I was gonna
switch anyway.

424
00:18:50,573 --> 00:18:53,558
You shouldn't have gone
in there with Ana.

425
00:18:53,594 --> 00:18:54,587
Why not?

426
00:18:54,623 --> 00:18:56,724
Because you shouldn't be
interrogating suspects.

427
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,454
I was talking to her.

428
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,289
And now, you're emotionally
invested in that girl.

429
00:19:00,325 --> 00:19:03,051
So, what if I am?
She is a scared, lonely kid.

430
00:19:03,086 --> 00:19:05,299
Who is the subject of
an investigation.

431
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:08,304
FBI agents are trained
to maintain their distance.

432
00:19:08,338 --> 00:19:09,651
I'm not an FBI agent.

433
00:19:09,685 --> 00:19:11,530
And yet, you want
to be treated like one.

434
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:12,976
You wanted a weapon,
so you got...

435
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,589
Which you agreed to,

436
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:15,782
because it was
too dangerous for me

437
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:17,362
to be in the field
without one.

438
00:19:17,396 --> 00:19:19,151
What's changed
all of a sudden?

439
00:19:19,185 --> 00:19:22,167
In this job you have
to remain objective.

440
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,357
Really?

441
00:19:24,425 --> 00:19:26,527
Is that what
you've done with me?

442
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:28,996
Stayed objective?

443
00:19:29,064 --> 00:19:31,019
I'm working on it.

444
00:19:32,076 --> 00:19:34,067
<i>Okay, you guys
should have eyes.</i>

445
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:36,472
Now, I can shut off Shawn's
alarm and security systems,

446
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,083
but the freeze is only gonna
last for about 90 seconds.

447
00:19:39,117 --> 00:19:40,374
That's all we need.

448
00:19:40,442 --> 00:19:42,112
Okay, Zapata,
you're up.

449
00:19:42,146 --> 00:19:45,267
<i>Look for a lever marked
"Primary Voltage Converter"</i>

450
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:48,278
that controls the power
going into Shawn's place.

451
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:49,726
All right, how high
do you want it?

452
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,184
As high as it goes.

453
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:52,653
I like your style.

454
00:19:54,322 --> 00:19:56,832
Okay, I've already
electronically jammed his fuses,

455
00:19:56,866 --> 00:20:00,426
and his wiring should
short out any second.

456
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,836
Whoa, what the hell?

457
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:14,411
No, no, no, no, no.

458
00:20:14,445 --> 00:20:16,760
Oh, my God,
this can't be happening.

459
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:23,044
_

460
00:20:31,593 --> 00:20:34,294
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

461
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:37,510
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

462
00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:40,078
Um, my place is on fire.
Send someone fast!

463
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,134
<i>We have a truck in your area</i>

464
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:43,039
<i>and we'll be there right away.
And, sir?</i>

465
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,595
Please evacuate your home

466
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,473
and get as far away
from the fire as possible.

467
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,442
That was kinda cool.

468
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,378
Okay, get ready, guys.

469
00:20:52,413 --> 00:20:53,547
<i>He's coming out hot.</i>

470
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,663
What is he doing?

471
00:20:57,698 --> 00:20:59,132
Trying to be a hero.

472
00:21:05,492 --> 00:21:06,454
Come on.

473
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,801
Get out.
Get out of there!

474
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:10,471
- Oh, God.
- Let's move.

475
00:21:10,506 --> 00:21:11,806
We're going in.

476
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:18,467
Come on.

477
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,016
This is all that comes up

478
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,577
when you try to use
Ana's software now.

479
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:39,250
TRAKZER is dead.

480
00:21:39,285 --> 00:21:41,654
What about Shawn Palmer,
is he cooperating?

481
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,378
Yeah, the nice thing about
arresting scumbags,

482
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:45,306
they're not big on
honor among thieves.

483
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,896
He's rolling over on every
Dark Web player we know of

484
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,038
and some we don't.

485
00:21:49,073 --> 00:21:50,826
What happens to Ana now?

486
00:21:50,862 --> 00:21:52,645
Well, she thought
she was working for us

487
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:55,333
and she cooperated when she
found out that she wasn't.

488
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:58,132
So, as long as she stays out
of trouble during probation,

489
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,352
she's free to go.

490
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:01,509
This case felt different
than the others.

491
00:22:01,544 --> 00:22:03,981
Yeah, none of us almost
got killed for a change.

492
00:22:04,017 --> 00:22:06,712
But we've been dealing with
corruption so much lately,

493
00:22:06,748 --> 00:22:09,832
I was starting to think
the tattoos were from an enemy.

494
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:12,367
Foreign spy agency,
something.

495
00:22:12,403 --> 00:22:14,231
But this time they
exposed technologies

496
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:15,788
trying to harm
our agents,

497
00:22:15,823 --> 00:22:17,823
like they were
looking out for us.

498
00:22:17,857 --> 00:22:20,537
So, whoever did this to me
is trying to help?

499
00:22:20,571 --> 00:22:22,881
Or want us
to think they are.

500
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:27,970
Hey.

501
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:29,835
What has got
you twisted?

502
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:31,526
That kid breaks the law,
profits from it,

503
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,797
and gets a slap
on the wrist.

504
00:22:32,832 --> 00:22:34,490
She never made
any money off of it.

505
00:22:34,525 --> 00:22:36,012
We're supposed to take
her word for it?

506
00:22:36,048 --> 00:22:37,435
If she got
paid in Bitcoin,

507
00:22:37,471 --> 00:22:38,617
we'd never be able
to trace it,

508
00:22:38,653 --> 00:22:39,748
we'd never
know for sure.

509
00:22:39,782 --> 00:22:42,230
Come on.
Palmer was the get.

510
00:22:42,265 --> 00:22:43,442
Ana was in over her head.

511
00:22:43,477 --> 00:22:45,427
She's a 17-year-old kid,
on her own,

512
00:22:45,462 --> 00:22:47,426
just trying to use
her skills to survive.

513
00:22:47,494 --> 00:22:49,596
Dirty money
is dirty money.

514
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:55,061
Shawn hurt a lot of people.

515
00:22:55,096 --> 00:22:57,519
And he probably would
have hurt a lot more

516
00:22:57,555 --> 00:23:00,056
if you didn't
help us catch him.

517
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,465
You should feel good.

518
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,028
I feel stupid.

519
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:07,731
He was just the first person
in a long time who...

520
00:23:09,202 --> 00:23:11,486
Forget it.

521
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:16,047
Do you want a ride home?

522
00:23:16,082 --> 00:23:17,413
I'm sure somebody
here could take...

523
00:23:17,448 --> 00:23:18,647
I'll be fine.

524
00:23:20,261 --> 00:23:22,395
Listen, if you...
if you want...

525
00:23:22,556 --> 00:23:25,825
if you ever want somebody
to grab a coffee with...

526
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,817
I don't drink coffee.

527
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:29,404
Right.

528
00:23:29,747 --> 00:23:32,814
I just mean, if you
ever wanna talk.

529
00:23:32,855 --> 00:23:34,556
Or we could
catch a movie.

530
00:23:34,634 --> 00:23:36,801
I can almost promise you
I won't have seen it.

531
00:23:42,243 --> 00:23:43,943
Maybe.

532
00:23:50,977 --> 00:23:52,344
Can I talk to you?

533
00:23:57,823 --> 00:23:59,824
Was I not clear before?

534
00:23:59,858 --> 00:24:02,095
That is not
how we do things.

535
00:24:03,403 --> 00:24:05,905
Well, maybe you
do things wrong.

536
00:24:05,972 --> 00:24:06,808
Ana didn't open up

537
00:24:06,844 --> 00:24:09,078
until I showed her
a little compassion.

538
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,126
And her opening up
saved lives.

539
00:24:11,162 --> 00:24:12,729
The case is finished.

540
00:24:12,778 --> 00:24:14,709
And, what, you're
inviting her to a movie?

541
00:24:14,743 --> 00:24:16,972
She is completely
alone in this world,

542
00:24:17,008 --> 00:24:20,721
and she needs something in
her life other than her work.

543
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:25,612
Jane...
Jane, if you ever

544
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:26,880
wanna come and have
a drink with the team...

545
00:24:26,914 --> 00:24:28,915
No, I...

546
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:30,390
It's a little
hard to relax

547
00:24:30,424 --> 00:24:33,173
when everybody at the table
has been staring at photos

548
00:24:33,209 --> 00:24:35,699
of your tattooed body
all day.

549
00:24:36,372 --> 00:24:37,538
What about Sarah?

550
00:24:37,573 --> 00:24:39,134
Your sister?

551
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,842
Her last name
is on my back.

552
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:47,656
Look, I appreciate everything
that you've done for me,

553
00:24:47,692 --> 00:24:48,989
everything that
you're doing.

554
00:24:49,023 --> 00:24:54,144
But I just...
I don't know, I...

555
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,781
I need room to breathe.

556
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:07,451
Hey.

557
00:25:07,487 --> 00:25:08,694
Do you have a minute?

558
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,989
Sure.

559
00:25:10,023 --> 00:25:12,250
Uh, it's about
Saul Guerrero.

560
00:25:12,286 --> 00:25:14,146
His case number
is on Jane's body,

561
00:25:14,182 --> 00:25:15,869
and I've been digging
through his file,

562
00:25:15,904 --> 00:25:18,101
but it's pretty redacted.

563
00:25:18,135 --> 00:25:19,316
Talk to Mayfair.

564
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,512
She'll get you
compartmentalized clearance.

565
00:25:21,548 --> 00:25:23,487
Uh, that's the thing.

566
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:26,026
I did,
and she won't help.

567
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,290
This is a pretty
big lead.

568
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:31,570
Don't you think it's a little
weird not to follow it?

569
00:25:31,605 --> 00:25:33,291
I wouldn't read
into it too much.

570
00:25:33,326 --> 00:25:35,102
I just don't understand why
we're not following up on this.

571
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:37,693
Fine, I'll look
into it, all right?

572
00:25:37,729 --> 00:25:40,593
If Mayfair says
there's nothing there,

573
00:25:40,627 --> 00:25:42,328
there's probably
nothing there.

574
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,334
Okay.

575
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:24,144
- What do you want from me?
- Fix your app.

576
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,539
The software's
too complicated, okay?

577
00:26:25,575 --> 00:26:26,744
That took me weeks
to code.

578
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:29,250
We don't need
the whole thing.

579
00:26:29,286 --> 00:26:31,169
Just find this truck.

580
00:26:34,018 --> 00:26:35,518
You have an hour.

581
00:26:36,984 --> 00:26:38,498
That's not enough time.

582
00:26:38,532 --> 00:26:40,753
Can you find it
or not?

583
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,724
I can find it.

584
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:47,260
You're still at my place?

585
00:26:47,328 --> 00:26:49,232
What have you been
doing there all day?

586
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:51,099
I cleaned.

587
00:26:51,138 --> 00:26:52,657
What do you mean,
you cleaned?

588
00:26:52,692 --> 00:26:54,200
You know, laundry, tidying.

589
00:26:54,234 --> 00:26:56,434
There may have been
a Swiffer involved.

590
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,271
Did you touch
my board games?

591
00:26:58,339 --> 00:27:01,579
Yes.
I alphabetized them.

592
00:27:02,911 --> 00:27:05,329
Wait... they were
alphabetized,

593
00:27:05,365 --> 00:27:06,946
by game designer!

594
00:27:06,981 --> 00:27:07,980
<i>Oh.</i>

595
00:27:08,048 --> 00:27:10,351
Um... well, I think
I can remember...

596
00:27:10,417 --> 00:27:13,921
No, no, it... it... it's fine,
I'll just do it when I get home.

597
00:27:13,988 --> 00:27:16,816
<i>But the place does look
very nice, though.</i>

598
00:27:21,395 --> 00:27:23,163
<i>What's wrong?</i>

599
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,493
Someone is trying to access
the system with my login.

600
00:27:26,528 --> 00:27:27,626
I'm being hacked.

601
00:27:27,662 --> 00:27:29,520
Through your FBI firewall?

602
00:27:29,556 --> 00:27:31,204
Who... who's good enough
to do that?

603
00:27:32,574 --> 00:27:34,407
I think I know.

604
00:27:39,713 --> 00:27:42,008
Palmer said
you were fast.

605
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:43,711
This is not fast.

606
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:46,007
I'm going as
quick as I can.

607
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,416
It sounds to me like
you articulated

608
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:49,026
your desire for space.

609
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,486
It didn't go very well.

610
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,192
Well, setting boundaries
is challenging.

611
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:53,886
Even in more conventional
relationships,

612
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,319
people struggle to balance
intimacy and autonomy.

613
00:27:56,355 --> 00:27:57,442
You and Agent Weller
have an...

614
00:27:57,477 --> 00:28:00,200
Unconventional
relationship, yeah.

615
00:28:03,397 --> 00:28:05,390
You didn't tell Weller
what we talked about

616
00:28:05,424 --> 00:28:06,492
this morning, did you?

617
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,912
Jane, our sessions
are confidential.

618
00:28:08,946 --> 00:28:12,613
Whatever you share,
it stays here.

619
00:28:12,842 --> 00:28:14,617
What makes you ask that?

620
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:17,121
Because he's
pushing me away.

621
00:28:17,356 --> 00:28:20,386
And that upsets you?

622
00:28:21,513 --> 00:28:24,751
Perhaps Agent Weller is feeling
the same need for boundaries.

623
00:28:28,061 --> 00:28:29,663
Sorry to interrupt.

624
00:28:29,713 --> 00:28:31,390
Patterson needs
to see us right now.

625
00:28:32,184 --> 00:28:33,500
She's not picking
up her cell.

626
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:34,968
I think the hack
was an S.O.S.

627
00:28:35,036 --> 00:28:36,074
How do you know
it was her?

628
00:28:36,108 --> 00:28:37,979
The first half of the code
was written in Python

629
00:28:38,013 --> 00:28:40,086
and then it
switches to Perl.

630
00:28:40,122 --> 00:28:42,036
It's an inside joke.
It's her.

631
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,083
So, where is she?
Can we track her location?

632
00:28:44,117 --> 00:28:47,440
Nope, her IP address is
routed through relay proxies.

633
00:28:47,474 --> 00:28:48,413
That's the only way
she could've hacked

634
00:28:48,448 --> 00:28:50,049
into our firewall.

635
00:28:50,365 --> 00:28:52,278
God, what's happening to her?

636
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,980
That's what I'm
trying to find out.

637
00:28:58,689 --> 00:29:01,693
Got it!
This is live on Ana's webcam.

638
00:29:03,777 --> 00:29:05,506
Oh, God.

639
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,894
All right,
the guy with the gun.

640
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:09,682
Can you capture his face enough
to use recognition software?

641
00:29:15,752 --> 00:29:17,820
Okay, Misha Volkov.

642
00:29:17,944 --> 00:29:20,380
Enforcer of the Petrovich
Heroin Syndicate.

643
00:29:20,414 --> 00:29:22,289
Russian drug runners.

644
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:23,532
They must know that
she built TRAKZER

645
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:25,119
and want to track
DEA movements.

646
00:29:25,154 --> 00:29:27,133
Which means they
need her alive.

647
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:28,355
For now.

648
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,151
That's Ana's apartment.

649
00:29:32,185 --> 00:29:33,961
Let's get Reade
and Zapata, we gotta move.

650
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,931
- Clear.
- Clear!

651
00:29:46,965 --> 00:29:49,034
- Clear.
- Clear.

652
00:29:49,068 --> 00:29:51,320
We must have
just missed them.

653
00:29:51,355 --> 00:29:52,679
Hey, can you get
on this computer,

654
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:53,588
find out what
she was tracking?

655
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:55,449
Yeah, I can try.

656
00:29:55,517 --> 00:29:57,451
One more time.

657
00:30:01,952 --> 00:30:02,587
_

658
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:04,752
Wait, the username.

659
00:30:04,788 --> 00:30:06,559
Is that Ana trying to
leave us a code?

660
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:09,930
No, that's a VIN number.

661
00:30:09,998 --> 00:30:11,731
She's showing us what
they're tracking.

662
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:13,834
And how to find her.

663
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:17,200
These guys are always
late for the transfers.

664
00:30:23,871 --> 00:30:25,471
Finally.

665
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,480
Uhh!

666
00:30:29,823 --> 00:30:31,156
Agh!

667
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:51,913
That was Patterson.
The VIN belongs

668
00:30:51,949 --> 00:30:54,872
to an unmarked Homeland Security
transport truck.

669
00:30:54,906 --> 00:30:57,314
It's carrying weapons on
the way to get shipped aboard.

670
00:30:57,348 --> 00:30:58,323
That's a massive arsenal.

671
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,144
We can't let that
fall into their hands.

672
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,946
Any word from
the drivers?

673
00:31:01,981 --> 00:31:03,784
DHS lost contact.

674
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,396
_

675
00:31:12,432 --> 00:31:14,162
_

676
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,981
It's all right.
We're gonna find her.

677
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:34,661
I know you think
I'm too invested.

678
00:31:34,695 --> 00:31:38,121
We're all invested now.
Let's get her safe.

679
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:53,130
_

680
00:31:58,414 --> 00:31:59,974
_

681
00:32:40,983 --> 00:32:42,718
R.P.G.! Move!

682
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,493
Do you see Ana?

683
00:32:57,551 --> 00:32:59,720
No, no sign of her.

684
00:33:05,561 --> 00:33:07,896
Get the girl!

685
00:33:16,553 --> 00:33:18,653
There.
Cover me!

686
00:33:18,689 --> 00:33:19,549
What?!

687
00:33:19,585 --> 00:33:21,125
Cover me!

688
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:27,296
Go.

689
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:39,058
Uhh!

690
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:44,840
Uhh!

691
00:33:46,461 --> 00:33:48,711
Come on, come here.

692
00:33:48,747 --> 00:33:50,086
You're okay.

693
00:33:55,262 --> 00:33:57,064
Gah!

694
00:34:15,297 --> 00:34:16,364
Aah!

695
00:34:19,335 --> 00:34:20,844
He's getting away!

696
00:34:28,384 --> 00:34:30,085
- Whoa!
- Aah!

697
00:34:50,114 --> 00:34:51,447
Thank you.

698
00:34:56,097 --> 00:34:57,398
Did the medic
clear you?

699
00:34:57,432 --> 00:34:58,746
Yeah, yeah, just, uh...

700
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,923
...a couple bruises.

701
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:07,179
Thanks for...
coming to get me.

702
00:35:07,213 --> 00:35:09,130
You're welcome.

703
00:35:10,534 --> 00:35:12,300
So, what's next?

704
00:35:12,335 --> 00:35:14,356
They're going to,
uh, keep you

705
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:17,842
under protective custody
for a while, just to be safe.

706
00:35:21,811 --> 00:35:23,746
It's not that bad.

707
00:35:26,235 --> 00:35:29,123
You don't know what any of
your tattoos mean, do you?

708
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:32,378
We're working on it.

709
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:36,012
Figure out that
steganography yet?

710
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:37,009
What?

711
00:35:37,043 --> 00:35:39,961
The black square
on your shoulder.

712
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:43,065
Steganography?

713
00:35:45,335 --> 00:35:47,063
Steganography, of course.

714
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:48,536
Can you fill
the rest of us in?

715
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,596
It's a... a method
of concealing messages

716
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:52,065
in innocuous images.

717
00:35:52,101 --> 00:35:54,768
It's used by spy services,
terrorists...

718
00:35:54,802 --> 00:35:56,144
it dates back to
the Ancient Greeks.

719
00:35:56,213 --> 00:35:57,329
So the black isn't
just covering

720
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:59,248
the Navy SEAL
tattoo underneath.

721
00:35:59,315 --> 00:36:01,456
Oh, well, that's the thing,
it's not all black.

722
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,547
Some of it's off-black.

723
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:05,023
So, uh, if you
isolate those sections

724
00:36:05,057 --> 00:36:07,682
and change their
values to white...

725
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:15,831
The mask isn't covering
the message.

726
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:18,246
The mask <i>is</i> the message.

727
00:36:27,626 --> 00:36:29,650
It's a classic
puzzle trick.

728
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:32,077
The dead space
is always a clue.

729
00:36:32,112 --> 00:36:33,668
Do you know
what it means yet?

730
00:36:33,702 --> 00:36:36,137
I mean, it looks
like a turtle shell,

731
00:36:36,172 --> 00:36:37,577
but that's not
very helpful.

732
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,123
I mean, maybe it's a...
a substitution cipher

733
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:41,202
using grid fragments,

734
00:36:41,237 --> 00:36:44,429
but that could take days
to decode, or longer.

735
00:36:44,465 --> 00:36:45,545
So, no?

736
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:46,657
Not yet.

737
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:47,847
But we're on it.

738
00:36:47,882 --> 00:36:49,432
You're saying every
one of these tattoos

739
00:36:49,467 --> 00:36:50,880
could have
a double meaning?

740
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:53,264
Or triple.
Or more.

741
00:36:54,268 --> 00:36:55,677
We should go back
over every tattoo

742
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:57,525
that we've already
decoded.

743
00:36:57,561 --> 00:36:59,954
I mean, the CDC symbol,
the drone pilot's name,

744
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:02,733
even my name on Jane's back.
Nothing's dead.

745
00:37:02,768 --> 00:37:05,036
Any of them can
hold another clue.

746
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,422
Thanks.

747
00:37:23,844 --> 00:37:26,210
Do you want
a new lead agent?

748
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,672
- What?
- On your case.

749
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:30,503
Back in
the surveillance van,

750
00:37:30,538 --> 00:37:35,202
you said...
I wasn't objective.

751
00:37:35,237 --> 00:37:37,135
So I can step down.

752
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,481
Mayfair can assign you
a new lead agent.

753
00:37:41,516 --> 00:37:43,076
I shouldn't have
said that.

754
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,545
I was upset.

755
00:37:47,172 --> 00:37:49,141
You might be right.

756
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:54,059
Maybe there's too much
baggage between us.

757
00:37:55,757 --> 00:37:58,311
Or maybe the baggage
is what makes you

758
00:37:58,347 --> 00:38:00,106
the right guy
for the job.

759
00:38:00,141 --> 00:38:02,701
Who else
is more invested?

760
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:13,213
Do you want me
to give you a lift home?

761
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,960
My security detail's
downstairs.

762
00:38:15,996 --> 00:38:19,884
It's no big deal.
It is on my way home.

763
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:21,753
Better not.

764
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:27,434
Good night.

765
00:38:27,469 --> 00:38:28,855
Hey, I was gonna catch
the end of the Knicks game

766
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,675
down at 1849,
you wanna come?

767
00:38:30,737 --> 00:38:33,222
- Mmm... next time.
- You sure?

768
00:38:33,257 --> 00:38:35,199
Never seen you
turn down 20-cent wings.

769
00:38:35,233 --> 00:38:39,242
Yeah, I think I'm
just gonna crash.

770
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:41,822
You know, if something's up,
you can talk to me, right?

771
00:38:44,184 --> 00:38:46,942
Do you need to talk?

772
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:48,978
Is that what
this is about?

773
00:38:49,014 --> 00:38:50,382
Good night, Tasha.

774
00:38:51,364 --> 00:38:52,751
Good night.

775
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,166
Kurt...

776
00:39:17,871 --> 00:39:19,467
I told you
I wanted him gone.

777
00:39:19,501 --> 00:39:21,184
Son...

778
00:39:21,219 --> 00:39:24,322
Just sit down
for one minute.

779
00:39:24,356 --> 00:39:26,150
He needs to hear it
from the both of us.

780
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:28,353
Hear what?

781
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,652
You haven't told him
about Jane, have you?

782
00:39:33,686 --> 00:39:35,827
Who's Jane?

783
00:39:35,894 --> 00:39:37,628
What's going on?

784
00:39:38,025 --> 00:39:39,697
Just sit down.

785
00:39:40,197 --> 00:39:41,778
Please.

786
00:39:43,572 --> 00:39:45,650
Where'd you find this
kind of stack in 12 hours?

787
00:39:45,686 --> 00:39:47,126
Couch cushions.

788
00:39:47,161 --> 00:39:48,240
Giants are laying
six on Sunday.

789
00:39:48,275 --> 00:39:50,409
Which way you leaning?

790
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,244
Out.

791
00:39:52,461 --> 00:39:54,282
I'm out, Randy.

792
00:39:54,318 --> 00:39:55,871
Yeah, I heard
that song before.

793
00:39:55,905 --> 00:39:57,873
Not from me.

794
00:40:01,003 --> 00:40:02,869
I'll see you soon, Tash.

795
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:21,452
They still don't know
what happened to her,

796
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:23,626
or who took her,
or where she went

797
00:40:23,661 --> 00:40:24,960
or how sh...
how she got back.

798
00:40:24,994 --> 00:40:27,737
But they did
the DNA tests.

799
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,715
And it's definitely her.

800
00:40:38,965 --> 00:40:41,099
Dad, Taylor's alive.

801
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:50,115
She is.

802
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:20,942
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

803
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:26,849
Um... do you guys want
to go out somewhere?

804
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:29,262
Grab a beer, maybe?

805
00:41:29,297 --> 00:41:30,943
Sorry, ma'am, we're not
permitted to take you

806
00:41:30,978 --> 00:41:33,297
to an unsecured location.

807
00:41:33,331 --> 00:41:37,121
Right, um, well, what about
coming in for a drink?

808
00:41:37,157 --> 00:41:39,391
- Just one.
- Sorry, ma'am.

809
00:41:39,425 --> 00:41:42,541
But we can have a bottle
sent up if you'd like.

810
00:41:42,577 --> 00:41:46,958
No, that's, um...
thanks anyway.

811
