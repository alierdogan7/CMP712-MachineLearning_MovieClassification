1
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:05,327
On December 1, 1935,

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:09,971
Mrs. Williams Starkwell,
a wife of a New Jersey handyman

3
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:12,271
gives birth to her first
and only child.

4
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,343
It is a boy,
and they name it Virgil.

5
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:19,348
He is an exceptionally cute baby,
with a sweet disposition.

6
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:21,719
Before he is 25 years old,

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,684
he will be wanted
by police in six states,

8
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:28,988
for assault, armed robbery,
and illegal possession of a wart.

9
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,687
Growing up
in a slum neighborhood...

10
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:35,201
where the crime rate is amongst
the highest in the nation is not easy.

11
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:40,872
Particularly for Virgil, who is a small
and frail compared to the other children.

12
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:12,200
Virgil Starkwell attends this school,
where he scores well on an IQ test,

13
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,830
although his behavior
disturbs the teachers.

14
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:20,706
We interviewed Mrs. Dorthy Lowry,
a school teacher who remembers Virgil.

15
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:24,515
I remember one time,
he stole a fountain pen.

16
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,847
I didn't want to embarrass him.

17
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,452
So, you know teachers
have a way of doing things.

18
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,285
And so I said to the class.

19
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,654
We will all close our eyes,

20
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:37,388
and will the one who took the pen,
please return it.

21
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:42,659
Well, while our eyes were closed,
he returned the pen.

22
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,870
But he took the opportunity
of feeling all the girls!

23
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,876
Can I say feel?

24
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,805
Spending most of his time
on the streets,

25
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,677
Virgil takes to crime at an early age.

26
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,382
He is an immediate failure.

27
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:05,454
Barely manages to escape with
a gumball machine stuck on his hand.

28
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,320
With both parents working
to make ends meet,

29
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,594
Virgil becomes closest
to his grandfather.

30
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,901
A 60-year-old German immigrant

31
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,267
who takes the boy to movies
and baseball games.

32
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,031
Then tragedy strikes.

33
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,769
At a Washington Senator's game,

34
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:27,108
Virgil's grandfather is struck
in the head by a foul ball.

35
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,408
The blow causes permanent injury
to his mind.

36
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,208
And he becomes convinced
he is Kyzer Willhelm.

37
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,786
Here are rare photos of him with other
patients on the sanitarium grounds.

38
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:46,327
When he is 15 years old, amidst
the violence and poverty of the slums,

39
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,263
Virgil receives a cello as a gift.

40
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,502
He is fascinated by the instrument.

41
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:59,441
And for the first time in the
Starkwell house, music is heard.

42
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:11,080
We spoke to Mr. Torgman,
his first and only cello teacher.

43
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,659
Well, there isn't really much tell,
because...

44
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:18,229
uh... because his cello playing
is just terrible.

45
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:23,358
He would a... He had no idea
about tone production.

46
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:27,236
He would just saw it
back and forth.

47
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:31,541
Just scratch the instrument,
to such a point

48
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,980
that it would drive everyone who
listening to it an absolutely insane.

49
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,811
He had no conception
of the instrument.

50
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,016
He was blowing into it.

51
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,623
He loved his cello.

52
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,960
And I think he stole to pay
for his lessons.

53
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:56,192
But he would not apply
himself one iota.

54
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,640
Virgil steals to pay for
cello lessons.

55
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,636
And although he does not achieve
greatness on the instrument,

56
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,338
he is soon good enough
to play in a local band.

57
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,979
A jungle however is no place
for a cellist.

58
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,048
And Virgil soon learns
the facts of life.

59
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,899
At 18, Virgil is lonely and confused.

60
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,601
Unable to concentrate in school,
he has long since dropped out.

61
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,311
He wants nothing more than to belong,
if only to a street gang.

62
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,612
It is here he thinks
he will prove his manhood.

63
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,919
Under constant economic pressure,

64
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:31,752
Virgil turns to the local pool hall
as a means of making a living.

65
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:35,465
I'm going to be a pool hustler,
he tells his friends.

66
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,795
Ball please.

67
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,338
Thanks.

68
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:13,269
Virgil tries to join the navy,
but is psychologically unfit.

69
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:21,044
That looks to me like two elephants
making love to a man's glee club.

70
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:26,845
Mr. T. S. Foster, Virgil's first probation
officer remembers him vividly.

71
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,111
He was a trustworthy kind of person.

72
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:32,917
I mean, you had to remember
certain idiosyncrasies that he had.

73
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,423
Like what?

74
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:40,360
Well, uh... like not always
telling the truth.

75
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,762
He didn't always tell the truth.

76
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:48,564
Sometimes, uh,
he'd exaggerate at the truth.

77
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:53,309
Sometimes, he, uh... you know,
just plain lies.

78
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,310
He does have a criminal record.

79
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,612
Yes, but that doesn't mean
the boy was all bad.

80
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,244
Unable to fit in with any aspect
of his environment,

81
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,549
Virgil strikes out on his own.

82
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,746
In an effort to shed some light
on this period of his life,

83
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,473
we spoke with his father and mother.

84
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,451
They are ashamed of their son's
criminal record and so wear disguises.

85
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,453
He was a good boy.

86
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:50,879
Oh, come on.

87
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,754
If he was a good boy,
why are we wearing these?

88
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,325
He's rotten!
He's a gangster, that's what he is.

89
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,887
Oh! How can you say that!
He was so bright.

90
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:04,698
- And he loved music.
- And he was an atheist.

91
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:09,469
I tried to beat God into him.
But he was too tough.

92
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,409
He was trying to get away
from us and be independent

93
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,708
and make his own life
and be a human being on his own.

94
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,009
You are a very dominating person.

95
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,844
- What?!
- You are!

96
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,646
And he was trying to find himself.

97
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:25,279
Ok, look, I'll talk to you later
about the whole thing.

98
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,352
Vowing he will never serve
his full term.

99
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:32,793
Virgil plans an elaborate escape using
a bar of soap and some shoe polish.

100
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,938
Guard, guard!

101
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,610
Yeah?

102
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,113
You've got to take me
to the infirmary!

103
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,621
- What's the matter?
- Don't ask!

104
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,084
Virgil's attempt to escape
is dealt with harshly.

105
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,856
His sentence is extended
in an additional two years.

106
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,495
1956 is a happy, go-lucky year
for most people.

107
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,083
Virgil sees none of it
from his tiny cell.

108
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,688
He marks time by reading.

109
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,822
Until one day,
a new opportunity arises.

110
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,192
We need volunteers
for an experiment.

111
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:19,203
The doctors want someone
to be inoculated with a new vaccine.

112
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,039
It has never been tried on
humans before,

113
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,111
so we do not know what
the side effects may be.

114
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:31,715
To be honest,
you'll be taking a chance.

115
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,153
As a reward, there's a parole.

116
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,850
I'm sure there are some among you
brave enough to take the risk.

117
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,620
With parole as inducement,
Virgil submits to the vaccine test.

118
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:49,225
It is a success,
except for one temporary side effect.

119
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,429
For several hours,
he is turned into a rabbi.

120
00:12:52,605 --> 00:13:00,740
And so the reason we celebrate the
Passover holidays is by eating Matzo,

121
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:05,373
is to commemorate
the time that Moses

122
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,520
led the children of Israel from Egypt.

123
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,594
He has so many good points.

124
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,097
Yeah, yeah... name.

125
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,267
He had all sorts of
mechanical abilities.

126
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,274
He was artistic.

127
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,711
You remember the painting
he did for you on your birthday?

128
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,612
He's a no good atheist,
that's what he is.

129
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,346
I tried to teach him about God.
Would he listen? No!

130
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,219
Virgil leaves prison apprehensive.

131
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,220
But with some hope that
he can began a new life.

132
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,060
Instead he finds the world
difficult to cope with.

133
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:56,496
Ashamed to go home, he rents
a cheap room in a strange city.

134
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:33,329
Desperate and broke, Virgil tries
to support himself with small crimes.

135
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,659
Here he attempts to rob
a local pet shop.

136
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,876
I hope you haven't been watching me,
I'm not very good.

137
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,287
Uh, I was strolling down here
just now and noticed that

138
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,951
you were drawing something
and I'd a...

139
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:36,091
- You can look at it, if you want.
- Can I?

140
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,727
Though it's not very good.

141
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:42,991
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
I think that's... that's wonderful.

142
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,660
- I uh... uh...
- It's not very good.

143
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,909
Well, I think that's very good, actually.
I think you can probably make cash.

144
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:57,379
- Are you an artist?
- No, of course not. I'm not an artist.

145
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,380
No? Well, what do you do?

146
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,519
- I'm a laundress.
- Laundress?

147
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:10,855
- Laundry?
- Yeah. I wash clothes, in Maryland.

148
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,288
That's great!

149
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,361
No it isn't. I like it,
but it's not particularly interesting.

150
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:22,730
- What's your name?
- Louise. What's yours?

151
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,206
Virgil. Starkwell, Virgil Starkwell.

152
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:29,142
- What do you do?
- What I do? What I do?

153
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,875
Um... I play the cello.

154
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,920
- Oh! That's fantastic.
- I'm a cellist.

155
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,816
- It's a wonderful job.
- Are you with the Philharmonic?

156
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,487
- Yes I am actually.
- Oh, that's fantastic!

157
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:48,396
Yes, I'm looking for my group.
Quite a good group, yeah.

158
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,697
I dress like this 'cuz I'm just walking.

159
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,403
- Do you kind of want to go for a walk?
- O.K.

160
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:02,742
I, uh... I knew I was in love,
but... first of all I was nauseous.

161
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,147
You know, I've never met
such a pretty girl.

162
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,184
I guess I'm sensitive.

163
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,983
Because, you know real beauty
makes me want to gag.

164
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:15,621
Plus, I don't know how to act with girls.
I'm nervous, shy with woman.

165
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,128
I have a tendency to dribble.

166
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:23,793
Uh, you know the only girl I've ever
known was a girl in my neighborhood.

167
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,029
But she wasn't an attractive girl.

168
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:30,097
I used to make obscene
phone calls to her collect.

169
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:34,441
She'd accept charges all the time,
but nothing ever happened.

170
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:39,075
But here I'm lying through my teeth
and I can't tell Louise

171
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:42,244
that I was in jail and I rob and steal

172
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,254
and never did an honest day's work
in my life.

173
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:47,325
You know a lot of people hold
those things against you.

174
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,987
But she was so sweet.
We just walked in the park.

175
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,567
I was so touched by her. I don't know,
after 15 minutes I wanted to marry her.

176
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:59,933
After half an hour, I completely gave up
the idea of snatching her purse.

177
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,165
I wanted to actually tell her
I wasn't with the Philharmonic,

178
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,140
but she was so impressed by it.

179
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,338
When she asked me
some questions about Mozart,

180
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,712
she got suspicious because
for a minute I couldn't place the name.

181
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,082
I, uh, I don't know...
when it comes to woman.

182
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:19,350
In prison I remember this psychologist
asked by if I had a girl, I said no.

183
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,291
Then he asked me,
do I think sex is dirty.

184
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:25,192
And he said it is,
if you were doing it right.

185
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,901
All I know is my heart
was really pounding

186
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,165
and I felt a funny tingling all over.

187
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:36,263
I don't know, I was either in love
or I had small pox.

188
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:51,088
- Hey, you want to have dinner tonight?
- Sure!

189
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,774
You're very beautiful.
I really mean that.

190
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:37,387
- Is it embarrassing, when I say that?
- Uh huh, it does.

191
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,589
That's a pretty hat.

192
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,390
Thank you.

193
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:47,054
- Yeah, I see it all over town.
- Really?

194
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,897
I haven't seen it around town.

195
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,159
Yeah, they have it on sale.

196
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,397
I passed them, while I was walking
around the streets.

197
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:58,237
I passed a million of them
in one of those bins.

198
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,045
That's alright.

199
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:06,409
I can watch to eat for nice.

200
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,687
Why?

201
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,402
After dinner, we went for a walk.

202
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,968
I uh, asked her for a lock of
her hair you know.

203
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,947
And we didn't have any scissors so
I tried pulling it out.

204
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,641
And she was a good sport
I tell you know.

205
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,345
I'm telling you when she gets
excited she stuttered.

206
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:46,390
She was so cute that way.
I like a girl who stutters.

207
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:51,189
They turn red, always gasping
for breathe you know it's sweet.

208
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,890
And she, um,
she was an expert on laundry.

209
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,900
She was fantastic.

210
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,060
I offered her to let her do my shorts

211
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,297
and she was very moved
by that I think.

212
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,202
She just knows everything
about underwear.

213
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,868
I never saw anyone who knew
so much about socks and T-shirts.

214
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:09,604
She was some kind of
genius that way.

215
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:26,190
G... g... good night Virgil.

216
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,867
Continuing his deception,
Virgil sees Louise more frequently.

217
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:40,400
When she questions him about his
cello playing, he avoids the subject.

218
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:47,140
In order to better understand Louise,
let us examine her background briefly.

219
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,743
Adopted at age two, from a cruel

220
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:53,447
and impoverished orphanage
by a cruel military man and his wife,

221
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,652
she was subjected to an upbringing
of extreme discipline.

222
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:59,252
Which left her shy and withdrawn.

223
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:02,825
Never having a real home,
she lived on army bases

224
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:05,832
while her father pursued
a brilliant military career.

225
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,997
But after 30 years the cadet
his rank to corporal.

226
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:14,070
Her mother, an alcoholic turns
to religion for comfort

227
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,874
and quickly becomes a fanatic.

228
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:19,775
She responds to Louise's need for love
by beating the child

229
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,353
and claims to have
conversations with God

230
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:25,752
in which they discuss salvation
and interior decorating.

231
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:33,126
Destitute and in love Virgil attempts
to change his life with one bold stroke.

232
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,747
And if you just take this to
window number 9.

233
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,044
Thank you.

234
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,618
What does this say?

235
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,861
Uh, can't you read that?

236
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:08,660
I can't read this. What is this?
"Abt natural"?

237
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:13,897
No it just reads, "Please put $50
thousand into this bag. Act natural."

238
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,766
Does it say, "Act natural"?

239
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:20,638
I, uh, am pointing a gut at you.

240
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,114
That looks like "gub",
it doesn't look like "gun".

241
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,508
No, it's "gub". That's a B.

242
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:31,483
No you see, it's an N... G-U-N.

243
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,253
George, would you step over here
a moment please.

244
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,888
What does this say?

245
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:44,760
"Please put $50 thousand
into this bag and... abt"

246
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:46,833
- What's "abt"?
- "Act"

247
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:50,105
Does this look like "gub" or "gun"?

248
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:54,307
"Gun". You see.
But what's "abt", mean?

249
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,969
It's "act"...A- C-T, act.

250
00:26:56,147 --> 00:27:00,481
Please put $50 thousand
into this bag. Act natural.

251
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,217
- Oh, I see, this is a hold up.
- Yes.

252
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,486
May I see your gun?

253
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:14,120
Well, you'll have to have this note
initialized by one of our vice-presidents

254
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,096
before I can give you any money.

255
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,301
I'm in a rush.

256
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:19,868
- What?!
- You see I'm in a rush.

257
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,198
I'm sorry, but that's our policy.

258
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,241
The gentleman in the gray suit.

259
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,377
That's gun... l'm pointing...

260
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,451
That's "gub"...
I'm pointing a gun at you.

261
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,645
That's B.

262
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,345
- No, it's N.
- Miss Frank!

263
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:42,222
"I'm pointing a gun at you.
Abt natural".

264
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,522
- What is "abt"?
- No, it's "act".

265
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,723
No, it couldn't be. It's a plain B.

266
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,162
No, no, I'm afraid not.

267
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,824
That's "act naturally.
I'm pointing a gun at you."

268
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,163
Mr. Miller!

269
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,761
"I'm pointing a gub"

270
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:58,397
No, that's gun, G-U-N.
It's "I'm pointing a gun at you."

271
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:01,636
It looks like a B, but it's a N.

272
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,966
Hello, Louise?

273
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,466
Listen, I can't make our date today.

274
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:28,572
I've got to go to Boston
and give a concert.

275
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:32,143
Well, look, why don't I give you
a call in about a...

276
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,767
In about 10 years.

277
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,887
Virgil Starkwell is apprehended
in the act of bank robbery.

278
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,422
He is given 10 years in the State's
strictest maximum-security prison.

279
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:54,029
It is here that he mingles with
harden criminals for the first time.

280
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:07,710
The prison has not been built that
can hold me, Virgil tells another inmate.

281
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:11,509
I'll get out of this one,
if it means spending my entire life here.

282
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:34,231
After all, what a child becomes...
Let's face it, it's our fault.

283
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,830
Would you let a man say
a word or two...

284
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:41,172
I knew there would be a day
when I said this kid is rotten.

285
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:44,679
You know the expression, a rotten kid?
That's what this kid is.

286
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:49,583
- It has to do with the genes.
- What?!? Genes??

287
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,716
Don't talk fancy in front of the man.

288
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,951
Because you know, you might
make an impression and you know...

289
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,188
The time passes slowly for Virgil.

290
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:01,093
He works hard and tries
to adjust to prison life.

291
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,729
He becomes a model prisoner
and is put to work in the laundry.

292
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,959
Visitor Starkwell.

293
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:37,624
For me?

294
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,306
I'm not with the Philharmonic.

295
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,808
I know.

296
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,145
I'm sorry.

297
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:07,154
It's O.K. Virgil. You don't mind
I came to see you, do you?

298
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,691
No, I'm more than happy to see you.

299
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,819
But how did you find out I was here?

300
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,188
I called your landlady.
She told me where you were.

301
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:17,734
She said that...

302
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,569
Virgil, did you rob a bank?

303
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:25,965
I did not rob a bank. If I robbed a bank,
everything would be great.

304
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:27,669
Well, what did you do?

305
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:31,248
I tried to rob a bank,
I think is what happened.

306
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,716
And uh, they got me.
I misspelled a note.

307
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,213
Virgil.

308
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,184
Can you bake?

309
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:48,697
I need a cake, a big cake.
A chocolate cake.

310
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,097
Virgil, you're allergic to chocolate.

311
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,430
I need a cake with a gun in it.

312
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,834
I'll bake you a cake
and put a gun in it.

313
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,034
I need a dozen chocolate chip cookies
with bullets in each of them.

314
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,805
How long are you going to be here?

315
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:09,276
Oh, well, uh,
I estimate a neighborhood of...

316
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,685
What's today, Monday?

317
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:16,455
Tuesday... Wednesday... 10 years.

318
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,922
Virgil!

319
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,426
Is it possible you can wait for me?

320
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,865
Yes, if you want me to.

321
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,137
With Louise to inspire him,
Virgil works hard

322
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,369
and becomes more optimistic.

323
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:36,505
She comes frequently
for the next few months.

324
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:43,819
He complains about the food,
and she brings home-cooked meals.

325
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:56,763
Louise's impact on Virgil is discussed
here by Dr. Julius Epstein,

326
00:33:57,001 --> 00:34:00,368
a one time prisoner psychiatrist,
who recalls Virgil.

327
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:04,968
Louise meant a great deal to Virgil
from a psychiatric point of view.

328
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:08,176
His love for her was
the healthiest thing in his life.

329
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:13,716
It was genuine and clean.
Not like some patients I know.

330
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,116
She ain't gonna wait Virgil.

331
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,946
They think they can,
but they never do.

332
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:23,819
You know I become eligible
for parole in a year and a half.

333
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,827
Yeah, well that's nice.

334
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:28,391
With any luck, maybe two or three
years you'll get out of here, yeah.

335
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,232
Could be a lot shorter.

336
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,102
What do you mean?

337
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,633
Means we got this proposition
we want to talk over with you.

338
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,506
What kind of proposition?

339
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:41,673
Like next week five of us are
going to make it out of here.

340
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,041
Now we need another man.

341
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:47,715
It's all set. By next week,
we can be miles away from this zoo.

342
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:50,445
You guys gotta be kidding.
We'll never get out of here.

343
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:51,510
They'd kill us.

344
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,715
We've got out of rougher places
than this.

345
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:57,452
Why don't you just think
about it, alright?

346
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,928
Ain't no broad gonna wait around
for years for you.

347
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:02,424
No matter what she tells you
in prison and all.

348
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:09,131
Well, I think the conflict
in this personality,

349
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:12,108
uh, sorta started from
his formative years.

350
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,803
I think it gives evidence
in his choice of the cello.

351
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,576
For instance, studying the cello
at the age of six.

352
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,714
Is just coming out of
the formative years,

353
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,378
but the conflict is there in his choice.

354
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:27,055
Because it is generally assumed
the cello is a phallic symbol,

355
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,184
I mean with the grasp

356
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:33,758
and the lowest structural forms
certainly a feminine,

357
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,593
if anything motherly.

358
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,768
In fact, the utilization of the bow,

359
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:44,637
I would imagine is the sublimation
of the stroking the torso.

360
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:50,136
So between the grasping, the phallic
and the stroking of the torso,

361
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:53,717
would create,
I would imagine great conflict.

362
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,342
Even at the age of six.

363
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,762
Virgil Starkwell becomes part
of an escape plot.

364
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:10,695
His every move becomes
tense and strained.

365
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:50,405
Think our guard on our floor is with us.
So be ready just in case there's trouble.

366
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,972
I still don't understand how we are
going to get past the main tower.

367
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,236
We are going to dress as guards.

368
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:58,904
That's why Friday at noon
because you work in the laundry,

369
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,914
you're going to steal
the guards underwear.

370
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:01,746
What?!?

371
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:04,912
We've already got some uniforms
stashed in the dark room.

372
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:05,954
I don't understand

373
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,048
If you got the guard's uniforms,
why do you need their underwear?

374
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:11,228
We want to do this
as realistically as possible.

375
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:12,626
I'm known for my detail work.

376
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:57,630
- Sir, we can't find our underwear!
- I think something's up.

377
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,334
Um, we'd better keep our eyes open.

378
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:06,016
The warden knows something.
We'd better call off the break.

379
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,376
What?!

380
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:10,685
I said, the warden knows
something is up. Call off the break.

381
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:15,019
- Everything is up for tonight.
- We can't take a chance.

382
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:20,489
Tell Charles.

383
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,332
Hey Charles, the warden knows
something is up.

384
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,065
We'll try again next week.

385
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:35,907
The warden wants to see you.

386
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,972
- What for?
- Come on!

387
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,984
Michael Sullivan, an ex-convict
and one of the leaders

388
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,456
of the ground break describes
the faithful day.

389
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:52,019
I told all the other guys,
that the break was off.

390
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,063
But I forgot to tell Virgil.

391
00:38:55,333 --> 00:39:00,396
I don't know why I forgot.
Nobody ever told him.

392
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,203
Already!

393
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:11,711
What?!

394
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:12,036
There's a break in the north cell block.
Notify the warden immediately.

395
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,690
Hey where is everybody?

396
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,420
They called the break off!

397
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,687
- They called the break off?
- Yeah!

398
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:37,727
- Why didn't somebody tell me?
- Virgil tried to escape by himself!

399
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:45,874
Could somebody possible sneak
downstairs and let be back in?

400
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,064
Look I got your daughter!

401
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:16,430
Hold you fire men!

402
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,702
Let me go or she gets it!

403
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,009
What is she doing down there?

404
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,244
She was kissing Kowalsky.

405
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:28,080
- Is Kowalsky a midget?
- No!

406
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,077
He is not a midget.

407
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,167
- Can I have a taxi, please.
- Try someone lines next.

408
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:43,584
On July 11, Virgil and Louise marry.

409
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:45,393
It is a simple ceremony

410
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:48,795
following what he later describes
as a deeply moving blood test.

411
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,259
This was the happiest
moment of my life.

412
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:54,337
I just wish my parents
could have been there.

413
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,603
We weren't aware...

414
00:42:56,707 --> 00:43:02,202
Am I right!! Be honest!! Say it!!
He turned out to be a punk.

415
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,675
They took up residence
in another State.

416
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,177
And living on
Louise's small savings,

417
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,981
they moved into
a cheaply furnished flat.

418
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:15,117
They are poor, but for the moment
at least they were save from the law.

419
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:18,127
When these innocent pictures
were taken,

420
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:22,425
they were both unaware of the series
of events that were to come.

421
00:45:07,446 --> 00:45:08,435
Oh!

422
00:45:09,214 --> 00:45:11,341
What's the matter Virgil?

423
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:14,143
- I got a cramp in the arch of my...
- What?

424
00:45:14,686 --> 00:45:17,154
I got another hardball
in the arch of my foot.

425
00:45:17,456 --> 00:45:19,924
How come that always happens
when we try to make love?

426
00:45:20,025 --> 00:45:21,424
Oh Jesus!

427
00:45:23,428 --> 00:45:27,159
As a wanted criminal, Virgil finds
it harder than ever to find employment.

428
00:45:27,733 --> 00:45:30,827
He secures a little work selling
encyclopedias door to door.

429
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:33,463
But the job proves too much for him.

430
00:45:35,007 --> 00:45:37,032
He is forced to take into the streets

431
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,272
and for a while he earns
a meager living selling meagres.

432
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:46,015
We're going to have a baby!

433
00:45:47,686 --> 00:45:49,244
Get out of here!

434
00:45:49,354 --> 00:45:51,151
No, no, we're going to have a baby.

435
00:45:51,223 --> 00:45:53,521
I went to the doctor and
we are going to have a baby.

436
00:45:54,459 --> 00:45:56,222
That's my present for Christmas.

437
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,289
All I needed was a tie.

438
00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:07,335
- Aren't you happy?
- I don't believe it.

439
00:46:07,573 --> 00:46:09,438
- No, Virgil, really.
- But how did it happen?

440
00:46:10,075 --> 00:46:12,066
What do you mean,
how did it happen?

441
00:46:14,212 --> 00:46:17,443
You mean because we, at night,

442
00:46:17,549 --> 00:46:20,916
when the two of us...

443
00:46:22,287 --> 00:46:24,585
and that's what happened?

444
00:46:26,124 --> 00:46:29,150
Then that spring Virgil and Louise
are blessed with a son.

445
00:46:29,928 --> 00:46:34,228
They name the baby Jonathan Ralph
Starkwell, after Virgil's mother.

446
00:46:53,218 --> 00:46:56,654
Virgil and Louise move to a new State
and try to start over.

447
00:46:57,055 --> 00:46:59,455
Virgil has the usual trouble
finding work.

448
00:46:59,891 --> 00:47:02,291
Finally he hears of an opening
in an insurance office

449
00:47:02,394 --> 00:47:04,259
and is back against the wall.

450
00:47:04,529 --> 00:47:06,622
He attempts to lie his way into the job.

451
00:47:10,936 --> 00:47:12,767
Please sit down.

452
00:47:18,677 --> 00:47:20,508
Name please.

453
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,548
John Q. Public. P-U-B-L-l-C.

454
00:47:27,986 --> 00:47:32,650
Mr. Public, have you any experience
working in an office before?

455
00:47:33,025 --> 00:47:34,424
Yes, I have.

456
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,521
What kind of office was it?

457
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,054
Rectangular.

458
00:47:41,566 --> 00:47:43,659
Have you any experience

459
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:47,330
in running a high-speed
digital electronic computer?

460
00:47:48,573 --> 00:47:50,006
Yes, I have.

461
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,210
Where?

462
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,643
My aunt has one.

463
00:47:57,516 --> 00:47:59,245
And what does your aunt do?

464
00:47:59,985 --> 00:48:02,180
I can't recall.

465
00:48:02,821 --> 00:48:05,016
You said before you
worked in an office.

466
00:48:05,157 --> 00:48:07,250
Did you deal in products or services?

467
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:08,758
Products.

468
00:48:10,295 --> 00:48:12,525
Is this something found in the home?

469
00:48:12,831 --> 00:48:15,732
No, it's not. One down and nine to go.

470
00:48:16,635 --> 00:48:18,296
Is this product edible?

471
00:48:18,804 --> 00:48:20,237
No, it wasn't.

472
00:48:20,338 --> 00:48:22,602
I think our time is running out

473
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:25,677
and I'm sorry you haven't guessed
my occupation.

474
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:29,508
So I'm going to flip all the cards
and tell you what I have used to do.

475
00:48:29,715 --> 00:48:32,309
I used to manufacture
escalator shoes,

476
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,885
for people who were nauseous.

477
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,982
I'm sorry, you didn't actually
get my occupation,

478
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,818
but you did win $10

479
00:48:39,925 --> 00:48:43,918
and I want to thank you very much.
Better luck next time.

480
00:48:44,096 --> 00:48:45,495
You are good sport.

481
00:48:46,364 --> 00:48:48,798
Hiding his past from
his fellow employees,

482
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:53,237
Virgil does well on his first decent job,
in the mailroom.

483
00:48:53,538 --> 00:48:55,938
His past catches up with him however,

484
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:59,101
as a fellow employee learns
of his criminal record.

485
00:48:59,511 --> 00:49:01,138
What are you doing for dinner,
Mr. Public?

486
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,244
Oh, Miss Blair, I'm having dinner
with my wife. Why?

487
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,377
Where are you having dinner,
Mr. Public?

488
00:49:07,185 --> 00:49:09,119
No, I said I'm having dinner
with my wife.

489
00:49:09,387 --> 00:49:11,821
I found this picture in a magazine.

490
00:49:13,058 --> 00:49:16,653
A word from me and you're
back in prison, O.K.?

491
00:49:17,195 --> 00:49:19,060
What do you feel like eating?

492
00:49:19,397 --> 00:49:22,662
Virgil Starkwell becomes the victim
of a blackmail plot.

493
00:49:22,901 --> 00:49:28,168
Miss Blair confident of her power
makes small demands for money.

494
00:49:28,473 --> 00:49:30,600
These increase as time goes on.

495
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,807
Everything that he owns dear
to him is in jeopardy.

496
00:49:34,246 --> 00:49:37,579
His life and family hang on the whim
of an unstable woman.

497
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:39,881
He is driven to desperation.

498
00:49:39,951 --> 00:49:43,387
With the responsibility of a wife
and child to protect,

499
00:49:43,588 --> 00:49:46,921
Virgil Starkwell contemplates murder.

500
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,853
What would u like to drink?

501
00:49:49,628 --> 00:49:51,596
Oh, what do you have?

502
00:49:52,164 --> 00:49:55,759
How about some Sherry,
I have some very fine Sherry?

503
00:50:02,307 --> 00:50:03,934
What's the matter?

504
00:50:04,943 --> 00:50:06,808
Did you hurt your hand?

505
00:50:07,646 --> 00:50:11,605
Clumsy!
I'll be right here.

506
00:50:14,586 --> 00:50:17,521
Disguising two sticks
of dynamite as candles,

507
00:50:17,923 --> 00:50:20,551
he sends Miss Blair
an anonymous gift.

508
00:50:24,462 --> 00:50:27,022
The plot fails however,
as he manages to make the dynamite

509
00:50:27,165 --> 00:50:29,133
too think to fit into the candlesticks.

510
00:50:30,669 --> 00:50:33,069
Determined to rid himself
of the blackmailer,

511
00:50:33,271 --> 00:50:36,297
he rents a car and attempts
to run her over.

512
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:04,293
You know, I think somebody's
trying to kill me.

513
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:05,836
Oh! Don't be silly.

514
00:51:05,971 --> 00:51:07,495
When I came home
from work last night,

515
00:51:07,572 --> 00:51:10,973
there was a car in my living room
trying to run me over.

516
00:51:11,409 --> 00:51:13,036
- A car? It must be your imagination.
- No.

517
00:51:13,211 --> 00:51:17,272
- Who would try to kill you?
- I don't know. I have no enemy.

518
00:51:17,549 --> 00:51:19,676
- You didn't tell anybody did you?
- No.

519
00:51:20,385 --> 00:51:22,444
You can do the carving.

520
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,759
Virgil!

521
00:51:37,335 --> 00:51:40,930
Can't you wait?
I mean you eat like an animal.

522
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,697
It's delicious, really.

523
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:45,704
I'll get the salad dressing,
we'll make a toast,

524
00:51:45,877 --> 00:51:48,038
then you start on the turkey leg.

525
00:52:13,939 --> 00:52:15,634
What are you doing in there?

526
00:52:15,807 --> 00:52:18,332
Oh, just creating the proper
atmosphere dear.

527
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,137
I'm a sucker for atmosphere.

528
00:52:20,412 --> 00:52:23,472
- Why don't you carve the turkey.
- Yes, of course my darling.

529
00:52:24,716 --> 00:52:26,343
Someone sent these as a gift.

530
00:52:26,418 --> 00:52:29,319
They were too big to use,
so I shaved them off at the bottom.

531
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:36,491
With law enforcement
agencies on his trail,

532
00:52:36,594 --> 00:52:39,028
Virgil takes his family
and heads south.

533
00:52:39,397 --> 00:52:42,594
Here they manage to secure
cheap lodging temporarily.

534
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:47,932
This is really a desperate time
of my life, you know.

535
00:52:48,073 --> 00:52:49,301
I... we had no money.

536
00:52:49,507 --> 00:52:54,308
I tried mugging old ladies but
I get hit in the groin with crutches.

537
00:52:54,612 --> 00:52:57,672
I didn't know what to do.
I tried counterfeiting for a while.

538
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:01,075
You know, I just got the plates
fouled up and everything.

539
00:53:01,186 --> 00:53:03,518
Once Lincoln came out
smoking a cigarette.

540
00:53:05,023 --> 00:53:07,389
I robbed a butcher shop.
That was the best I could do.

541
00:53:07,525 --> 00:53:09,493
I got away with 116 veal cutlets.

542
00:53:09,861 --> 00:53:12,989
Then I had to go out and rob
a tremendous about of breading.

543
00:53:25,643 --> 00:53:28,203
Their money gone and
with food scarce,

544
00:53:28,346 --> 00:53:30,906
the Starkwells live
like hunted animals.

545
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,512
We weren't very happy then.

546
00:54:06,951 --> 00:54:09,078
Oh no, this was the low point
of my existence.

547
00:54:09,154 --> 00:54:10,678
I was thinking about
getting out of crime

548
00:54:10,755 --> 00:54:13,451
altogether and maybe
becoming a singer or something.

549
00:54:13,925 --> 00:54:16,291
Must have been a very tough
decision for you to make.

550
00:54:16,394 --> 00:54:20,990
Oh, yeah. It was really tough,
but my family was starving

551
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,692
and I'd already filed
for bankruptcy, you know.

552
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,901
I see. What prompted you to go on?

553
00:54:28,206 --> 00:54:31,869
Well, I came up with an idea
for robbery that was so fantastic.

554
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:34,274
It was so brilliant that when it was over

555
00:54:34,379 --> 00:54:37,712
it was considered the real work of art,
by all the guys in my cellblock.

556
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:42,486
- They must of looked up to you.
- Well, you know those guys are mugs.

557
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:51,492
- I, uh, I'm gonna rob a bank.
- Oh no, Virgil, not again!

558
00:54:51,563 --> 00:54:54,964
I think that's our only way out of this mess,

559
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:58,228
is for me to... There's a dinky bank
in Ross County.

560
00:54:58,369 --> 00:55:00,064
And I think if I can get two
or three good men,

561
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,468
I can get in there and get it.

562
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:05,439
We can go down to Mexico
or up to Canada and...

563
00:55:07,445 --> 00:55:09,811
- Virgil, what if you got killed?
- No, don't worry.

564
00:55:09,881 --> 00:55:11,178
Nothing to worry about.
I know how to use a gub.

565
00:55:11,649 --> 00:55:14,209
- No, it's gun, Virgil.
- Gun, I'm sorry.

566
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:15,377
Yes!

567
00:55:27,265 --> 00:55:29,062
Don't turn around.

568
00:55:30,268 --> 00:55:32,793
I want to speak to you about
a business proposition.

569
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,840
It's a bank job.

570
00:55:41,779 --> 00:55:43,474
Couple of guys and myself
are going to

571
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,448
get together and
four weeks from now...

572
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:50,150
quart of a million dollars.
We walk in and take it like that!

573
00:55:50,421 --> 00:55:55,051
It's an easy job.
Think we just pull up and take it.

574
00:56:01,799 --> 00:56:07,897
How long have you, uh... because
I said part about the bank... the bank.

575
00:56:12,177 --> 00:56:15,146
You guys are dressing alike again.

576
00:56:16,014 --> 00:56:19,973
See, I just broke it myself.

577
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,580
All the boys in the neighborhood
were...

578
00:56:23,721 --> 00:56:25,450
Wasn't his fault,
we just didn't have time for him.

579
00:56:25,557 --> 00:56:26,785
We were working so hard.

580
00:56:27,091 --> 00:56:28,490
Would you like to see
my stamp collection.

581
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:29,582
What do you mean stamp collection?

582
00:56:29,727 --> 00:56:31,786
I have a stamp collection...

583
00:56:32,397 --> 00:56:35,127
First, he selects an appropriate bank.

584
00:56:36,201 --> 00:56:38,795
Next he cases the bank
by cleverly concealing a camera

585
00:56:38,903 --> 00:56:40,700
in an unsuspected place.

586
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,438
That night, a meeting takes place.

587
00:56:51,583 --> 00:56:54,108
Among the one's chosen
are some of the sinister names

588
00:56:54,185 --> 00:56:55,379
in the underworld.

589
00:56:56,421 --> 00:56:59,083
William Amerz, wanted by the police
for bank robbery,

590
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:01,181
assault with a deadly weapon,

591
00:57:01,259 --> 00:57:04,626
murder, and getting naked
in front of his in-laws.

592
00:57:07,232 --> 00:57:12,192
Frankie Wolf, wanted by Federal
authorities for dancing with a mailman,

593
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:18,465
A.D. Armstrong, wanted all over
the country for arson, robbery,

594
00:57:18,576 --> 00:57:22,307
assault with an attempt to kill,
and marrying a horse.

595
00:57:29,787 --> 00:57:34,417
Alright boys. Had to talk about
the Union Fidelity Bank.

596
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,759
June 16th, 10 a.m.

597
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:41,965
What you are about to see is a film
of the Union Fidelity Bank.

598
00:57:42,233 --> 00:57:44,167
We are going to see it just once.

599
00:57:44,269 --> 00:57:46,897
And to destroy the evidence
we are going to eat the film.

600
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:50,233
It will be buffet style,
you can just help yourselves.

601
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:53,572
Take plates of potato salad over there
and my wife made coffee.

602
00:57:54,078 --> 00:57:56,740
This film might just save your lives.

603
00:58:07,825 --> 00:58:09,952
The film was a boring short.

604
00:58:11,229 --> 00:58:15,256
He'd have the gang over for a meeting

605
00:58:15,767 --> 00:58:20,261
and I'd put out a little tray of
pretzels and bullets...

606
00:58:21,339 --> 00:58:23,102
I had to, he's my husband.

607
00:58:23,441 --> 00:58:28,401
We got this film camera,
we have lights, and a truck.

608
00:58:28,513 --> 00:58:30,413
The idea is we pull up
in front of the bank

609
00:58:30,515 --> 00:58:32,244
and we look like
we are making a movie.

610
00:58:33,351 --> 00:58:36,980
We play the actors.
We need somebody to be the director.

611
00:58:39,023 --> 00:58:41,821
Gertch! I got the perfect guy!

612
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:47,520
An ex-con I did some time with,
by the name of a Fritz.

613
00:58:48,132 --> 00:58:53,092
I will be the director.
I once was a film director,

614
00:58:53,171 --> 00:58:55,833
a many years ago,
before movies had sound.

615
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:59,365
I worked with Johnny Gilbert and
Antonio Valentino, Lois Garret.

616
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,338
Lois Garret was a baseball player.

617
00:59:01,612 --> 00:59:05,844
I was also that ball...
For the Yankees...

618
00:59:08,486 --> 00:59:12,684
The fools in Hollywood
didn't look up nice geniuses.

619
00:59:14,258 --> 00:59:18,786
But now, I shall wear a new uniform,
like I did, once again.

620
00:59:19,564 --> 00:59:22,556
And you will be my actor.

621
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:27,194
You shall enter in the back and say,
"Up with your hands, this is a stickup."

622
00:59:27,405 --> 00:59:32,104
Thereby announcing our theme.

623
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:36,237
- Now say it. Let me hear the lines.
- Up with your hands, this is a stick up.

624
00:59:36,381 --> 00:59:39,179
No! More feeling.
Begin now.

625
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:43,281
Uh, Fritz, this is a bank robbery
not a movie.

626
00:59:44,322 --> 00:59:45,687
Oh, yes, of course.

627
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:50,850
Oh, forgive me.
I will be fine, when the time comes.

628
00:59:51,229 --> 00:59:54,630
Thank you all.
Everybody, take five.

629
01:00:10,081 --> 01:00:12,447
Ohhh, don't tell me you are going
to use the shower now.

630
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,945
Virgil, why do you do this to me
every morning?

631
01:00:15,019 --> 01:00:16,316
I just got in here.

632
01:00:16,454 --> 01:00:18,684
Well, I'm going to be late
for the robbery.

633
01:00:18,923 --> 01:00:21,619
So you'll be five minutes late.
They can start without you.

634
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:23,885
They can't start without me,
I'm the leader.

635
01:00:24,328 --> 01:00:27,422
- I made you some coffee.
- Oh! Jesus!

636
01:00:28,433 --> 01:00:31,266
Oh, Jesus! Every day I have trouble
getting into the bathroom.

637
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:33,428
For crying out loud!

638
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:38,800
Honey, what shirt
do you wanna wear?

639
01:00:38,876 --> 01:00:40,002
What did you say?

640
01:00:40,344 --> 01:00:44,474
- I said, what shirt do you wanna wear?
- I'm gonna wear my light blue.

641
01:00:45,316 --> 01:00:49,116
No you're not.
It was dirty, I washed it last night.

642
01:00:49,253 --> 01:00:51,389
Why did you wash it?
I was gonna wear it today.

643
01:00:51,389 --> 01:00:52,754
I washed it because it was dirty.

644
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,719
- So what, I'm just gonna rob a bank.
- I have happened to

645
01:00:54,826 --> 01:00:56,726
have ironed your beige shirt.
Do you wanna wear that?

646
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,158
No, I can't wear a beige shirt

647
01:00:58,262 --> 01:00:59,058
- to a bank robbery.
- Why not?

648
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,128
Because it's light.
I'll be an easy target.

649
01:01:01,232 --> 01:01:03,097
I think it is a perfectly
good shirt to wear.

650
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:07,001
No, it isn't a good shirt, it's beige.
Who wears beige to a bank robbery?

651
01:01:07,071 --> 01:01:08,470
What are the other guys wearing?

652
01:01:08,606 --> 01:01:10,335
I don't know... For crying out loud.

653
01:01:10,441 --> 01:01:12,204
Why don't you call them up
and ask them?

654
01:01:12,477 --> 01:01:15,969
Oh, no body is going to be wearing
beige to a bank robbery.

655
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:17,547
It's in poor taste.

656
01:01:25,256 --> 01:01:29,283
June 16, 9 a.m.
The days of planning are over.

657
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,924
Virgil and his accomplices depart
from his hideout and proceed

658
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:34,725
toward their destination.

659
01:02:08,633 --> 01:02:10,794
Everybody put your hands up,
this is a stickup!

660
01:02:18,543 --> 01:02:20,841
Hey, what are you doing here?

661
01:02:20,978 --> 01:02:23,139
- We're holding up the bank.
- We are holding up the bank.

662
01:02:23,247 --> 01:02:24,771
Oh no, I'm sorry,
we are holding up the bank.

663
01:02:24,882 --> 01:02:26,543
We're holding up the bank.

664
01:02:26,684 --> 01:02:27,810
Oh no, we were here first.

665
01:02:28,352 --> 01:02:30,547
Look could you come back tomorrow,
we'll be finished by then.

666
01:02:31,088 --> 01:02:32,578
We've been planning this for months.

667
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:34,555
We're not going to have
it ruined by a jackass.

668
01:02:35,426 --> 01:02:36,825
Alright, we'll take a vote.

669
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:39,361
How many people here would
like to be held up by this group?

670
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:46,265
Now how many people would
like to be held up by our group?

671
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:53,038
Now, beat it!

672
01:02:55,012 --> 01:03:01,747
You call this a bank robbery?
I yelled action, five minutes ago.

673
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,788
Is that the way to pick up all it?

674
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,121
What's going on in here?
There's a million cops outside.

675
01:03:11,462 --> 01:03:12,793
Let's get out of here!

676
01:03:30,781 --> 01:03:34,239
Each member of the gang gets
five years for his part in the crime.

677
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:35,751
Virgil gets ten.

678
01:03:36,621 --> 01:03:39,818
He is not taken to prison
this time but to a road gang

679
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:43,089
where his criminal behavior
will cost him dearly.

680
01:03:44,295 --> 01:03:48,129
You men come here
because you committed crimes

681
01:03:48,432 --> 01:03:51,595
rendering you unfit
to live in decent society.

682
01:03:52,003 --> 01:03:53,095
That's too bad.

683
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:56,970
I think you gonna find you made
a mistake you're gonna regret.

684
01:03:58,309 --> 01:04:02,973
Our job of mine and the boys
is to see that you get some civilization

685
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,275
so that when you leave here

686
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:10,343
you're gonna think twice
before you perform anti-social acts.

687
01:04:11,522 --> 01:04:16,550
And my advice to you is
obey the rules and do your job.

688
01:04:16,827 --> 01:04:18,419
If you have complaints,
you come to me.

689
01:04:18,496 --> 01:04:20,225
Don't think anybody outside
is gonna help you.

690
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:25,863
Now we don't like complainers
and we don't like troublemakers.

691
01:04:27,204 --> 01:04:30,230
If things get a little too rough
for you in here,

692
01:04:31,609 --> 01:04:33,668
you just feel free to take off for Florida.

693
01:04:36,013 --> 01:04:38,743
Show 'em in which direction
Florida is, boys.

694
01:04:46,123 --> 01:04:47,647
Any questions?

695
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:51,085
Do you think a girl should pet
on the first date?

696
01:04:51,696 --> 01:04:52,958
What?!

697
01:04:53,564 --> 01:04:56,533
I... I mean if both parties involved
are mature and liberal.

698
01:04:57,234 --> 01:05:03,469
Gonna see Ms Eliza...
gonna go to Mississippi...

699
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:29,185
Hey, do you think you gotta

700
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:33,061
good enough aim for that hammer
to knock these bracelets off me?

701
01:06:33,464 --> 01:06:34,863
Look man, I don't want to
get into any trouble.

702
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:38,297
Nothing is going to happen.
You think you can do it?

703
01:06:38,836 --> 01:06:40,303
I've never missed yet.

704
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:42,566
Alright, go ahead.

705
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,609
Sorry man, first time.

706
01:07:00,524 --> 01:07:03,618
Food on a chain gang is scarce
and not very nourishing.

707
01:07:04,161 --> 01:07:07,255
The men get one hot meal a day.
A bowl of steam.

708
01:07:14,839 --> 01:07:18,104
Alright boys, who didn't give me
a good days of work?

709
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:28,049
Come with us Wilson.

710
01:07:44,168 --> 01:07:46,500
What's the matter Starkwell,
can't you take it?

711
01:07:47,037 --> 01:07:49,938
Come on, I want you to see this, so
you can know what to look forward to.

712
01:08:06,824 --> 01:08:09,156
Just what in the hell
do you think your doing?

713
01:08:09,326 --> 01:08:10,486
What do you mean?

714
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:14,158
Don't beat the shit out
of your damn fool, beat him.

715
01:08:14,932 --> 01:08:16,456
Oh, him!

716
01:08:17,868 --> 01:08:21,269
The time drags by an endless
grind of backbreaking labor.

717
01:08:23,841 --> 01:08:26,401
Brutal discipline is common
under the hot sun.

718
01:08:26,844 --> 01:08:29,836
The men aren't even permitted
to faint without written permission.

719
01:08:30,614 --> 01:08:33,583
Virgil complains and
he is severely tortured.

720
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:36,086
For several days he is locked
inside a sweatbox

721
01:08:36,086 --> 01:08:37,610
with an insurance salesman.

722
01:08:38,055 --> 01:08:42,185
Hi, I'm Joe Green, I represent Ajax
and Widget Insurance Company.

723
01:08:42,393 --> 01:08:45,590
I'd like to talk to you about a little
insurance... You're about 30, right?

724
01:08:45,763 --> 01:08:50,700
I think the best thing to do is get
straight life then a little term... and...

725
01:08:50,768 --> 01:08:52,167
How about dental and medical?

726
01:08:52,236 --> 01:08:54,101
We got a great deal on dental
and medical deal.

727
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,404
At the end of each work day,

728
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:02,001
the men are chained to each other
by the ankle, by a group of six.

729
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:06,544
Making movement slow and painful.
And escape almost impossible.

730
01:09:14,959 --> 01:09:18,122
Then one day, the impossible
is attempted.

731
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:26,468
See that field?

732
01:09:26,603 --> 01:09:29,197
If we make it across that field,
we'd be out of here.

733
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:33,106
We can take him by surprise
and we all make a sudden break for it.

734
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:34,772
You're crazy.

735
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:38,981
That's right, I'm a paranoid
schizophrenic but I say we try it.

736
01:09:39,883 --> 01:09:41,282
Ain't that right boys?

737
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:42,443
Right.

738
01:10:05,442 --> 01:10:07,637
I'm not with them, I wanted to stay.

739
01:10:08,512 --> 01:10:10,309
Alright, everyone split up!

740
01:11:59,957 --> 01:12:01,891
My car broke down,
can I use your telephone?

741
01:12:02,126 --> 01:12:04,094
Of course, come in.

742
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:25,579
O.K. Now, we're going to
get out of here.

743
01:12:25,849 --> 01:12:28,647
I know a guy in town, he's got enough
tools to get us out of these chains.

744
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:36,253
Alright, now you act natural and
answer it or you're finished.

745
01:12:36,793 --> 01:12:38,055
Who is it?

746
01:12:38,462 --> 01:12:40,726
Patrol man Lynch, can I come in?

747
01:12:41,165 --> 01:12:42,564
Well, not now.

748
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:45,233
It's an emergency. I'm afraid I have to.

749
01:12:45,502 --> 01:12:46,696
We'd better untie her.

750
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:49,800
Tell him we're your cousins.
We are visiting you from out of town.

751
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,778
Alright, one false move
and you're finished.

752
01:13:03,387 --> 01:13:04,615
What is it?

753
01:13:04,788 --> 01:13:07,484
I hear there's been some trouble,
up at the prison.

754
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:09,559
I'm checking area for
anything suspicious.

755
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:13,956
These are my cousins.
They're visiting me for the holiday.

756
01:13:14,298 --> 01:13:15,526
What holiday?

757
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:18,959
Have you ever heard of
St. Dabbernappy's Day?

758
01:13:19,036 --> 01:13:19,900
No.

759
01:13:20,537 --> 01:13:21,765
That's what we're here for.

760
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,170
Come here you.
Come here!

761
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:35,680
Do you think your cousin is
safe here living all alone?

762
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:38,586
Look how close we are to the prison.

763
01:13:38,722 --> 01:13:41,657
Look out here, just a few miles
off down the road.

764
01:13:42,526 --> 01:13:43,857
Come here!

765
01:13:47,397 --> 01:13:52,994
I don't know... you sure can't be
secure if you live so close to a prison.

766
01:13:53,403 --> 01:13:56,964
Hey, wait a minute!
Did I see something move out there

767
01:13:57,107 --> 01:13:58,199
Couldn't have!

768
01:13:58,408 --> 01:14:00,171
I'm sure I saw something move.

769
01:14:00,277 --> 01:14:02,768
Quick! Everyone take one window
and check it.

770
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:06,172
If there's somebody out there,
we gotta have a chance to see him.

771
01:14:12,756 --> 01:14:14,815
Guess it must have been
my imagination.

772
01:14:18,061 --> 01:14:19,221
Now?!

773
01:14:20,597 --> 01:14:22,292
Excuse us.

774
01:14:37,147 --> 01:14:39,445
- They're escaped convicts.
- Really?

775
01:14:39,616 --> 01:14:40,776
They've broken in...

776
01:14:40,917 --> 01:14:44,683
didn't you notice how they
all moved together closely?

777
01:14:44,821 --> 01:14:46,948
They're chained together at the ankles.

778
01:14:47,257 --> 01:14:49,418
I thought they were just a close family.

779
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:52,455
O.k. Boys, the games up.

780
01:14:55,966 --> 01:14:57,831
The old lady must of told him.

781
01:14:58,402 --> 01:14:59,994
You're going back to that prison.

782
01:15:00,137 --> 01:15:02,128
And this time, you're
going to stay there.

783
01:15:06,977 --> 01:15:08,342
If we're gonna go, we need tools.

784
01:15:08,545 --> 01:15:10,137
Let's get my wife
she'll help us out of this.

785
01:15:19,122 --> 01:15:22,523
Oh Virgil. If you'd only listen to me
you'd of gone straight.

786
01:15:23,193 --> 01:15:25,753
Honey, we needed the money
and I robbed a bank.

787
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:28,698
Virgil, when are you going to
stop doing that?

788
01:15:28,832 --> 01:15:32,734
Don't you realize you're a father?
You have responsibilities.

789
01:15:32,936 --> 01:15:34,767
Well, if she's my wife,
I'd build her one.

790
01:15:35,038 --> 01:15:36,835
Do you mind keeping
out of this please?!

791
01:15:36,973 --> 01:15:39,271
I don't want to discuss
it unless we're alone.

792
01:15:39,409 --> 01:15:41,434
Well, I want to discuss it now!

793
01:15:41,545 --> 01:15:43,274
Alright, you don't want to
discuss it alone...

794
01:15:43,413 --> 01:15:45,745
O.k. I'm going to the next room
and if you want to talk about it

795
01:15:45,849 --> 01:15:46,713
right now!

796
01:15:46,983 --> 01:15:49,144
I can't come in alone I'm chained.

797
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:51,844
We can't be alone unless
we go some place

798
01:15:51,955 --> 01:15:55,288
where they have tools or something.
These guys are with me for good now.

799
01:15:55,726 --> 01:15:57,193
How do you think I feel?

800
01:15:57,294 --> 01:15:59,922
I'm a young woman sleeping
alone here every night.

801
01:16:02,065 --> 01:16:04,260
Don't you think that mean
something to me?

802
01:16:04,368 --> 01:16:05,596
How do you think I feel?

803
01:16:05,869 --> 01:16:08,269
I look back to the days when
you were in the Philharmonic.

804
01:16:08,505 --> 01:16:10,905
I was never in the Philharmonic.

805
01:16:11,041 --> 01:16:12,668
- You used to lie in bed...
- Shut up!

806
01:16:12,743 --> 01:16:15,041
You used to make love to me...
you used to recite poetry and...

807
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:17,838
- Poetry?
- And play with that doll you got me...

808
01:16:21,184 --> 01:16:24,813
Darling look... you guys look away
for a minute...

809
01:16:24,988 --> 01:16:27,650
Sweet heart, don't you know,
no matter what happens

810
01:16:27,758 --> 01:16:29,589
you're going to mean the same to me.

811
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:32,421
You... would you stop giggling?

812
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:37,289
You'd always mean the sun
and the earth and the moon to me.

813
01:16:37,634 --> 01:16:39,033
Oh Christ!

814
01:16:41,638 --> 01:16:45,074
With Louise's help, the chains
are removed from Virgil's ankle.

815
01:16:45,475 --> 01:16:47,773
Once more the family takes flight.

816
01:16:48,044 --> 01:16:52,378
Feeling guilty about their son's
education, Louise tries tutoring him.

817
01:16:57,254 --> 01:16:59,119
He's been very depressed.

818
01:17:00,924 --> 01:17:04,724
I think... I think if he'd been
a successful criminal

819
01:17:04,861 --> 01:17:07,227
he would of felt better.

820
01:17:08,698 --> 01:17:11,360
You know he never made
the "Ten Most Wanted" list.

821
01:17:12,803 --> 01:17:15,738
It's very unfair voting.
It's who you know.

822
01:17:15,906 --> 01:17:18,374
Virgil Starkwell embarks
on a series of crimes

823
01:17:18,508 --> 01:17:20,772
that make him a wanted desperado.

824
01:17:33,757 --> 01:17:36,123
Here he attempts to rob
the vault of a bank.

825
01:17:36,526 --> 01:17:39,222
But, finds a family of gypsies
are living there.

826
01:17:41,965 --> 01:17:46,459
By the end of six months the FBI
regard Virgil as a menace.

827
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:49,637
Although he doesn't make
the "Ten Most Wanted" list,

828
01:17:49,906 --> 01:17:52,374
he does win
"gangster of the year" award

829
01:17:52,609 --> 01:17:55,544
and is asked to speak
at many luncheons and universities.

830
01:17:56,513 --> 01:17:59,971
While the end of the story,
We spoke to Mr. Daniel Miller

831
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:02,845
an FBI agent and the author
of the book "Mother was a Red".

832
01:18:03,186 --> 01:18:06,019
The FBI actually wanted
Virgil very badly.

833
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:11,289
Mr. Hoover was quite upset by
Mr. Starkwell and his activities.

834
01:18:11,561 --> 01:18:14,689
In fact, he confided to me
on several occasions... uh...

835
01:18:14,831 --> 01:18:16,128
I can remember one very well.

836
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:18,793
After a bowling match,
on a Thursday night,

837
01:18:19,102 --> 01:18:23,664
he said he couldn't sleep nights
and was smoking a little too much.

838
01:18:23,974 --> 01:18:29,606
And um, he thought that this,
uh... this criminal as he put it,

839
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:34,141
might very well be part of
a subversive plot.

840
01:18:35,452 --> 01:18:40,389
Obviously, uh, an atheist
and uh, a pinto,

841
01:18:40,557 --> 01:18:44,357
and a time general to
disturb our society.

842
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:48,557
We finally traced him to a cheap
neighborhood down

843
01:18:48,665 --> 01:18:50,599
in the lower east side of New York.

844
01:18:51,067 --> 01:18:55,003
Where he was living at the time
at a sleazy run down tenement house.

845
01:18:55,505 --> 01:18:58,906
Virg, I remember him. I used to live
with him a matter of fact,

846
01:18:59,009 --> 01:19:00,806
in the same rooming house that is.

847
01:19:02,012 --> 01:19:04,446
One day he told me
he was a gynecologist.

848
01:19:04,915 --> 01:19:08,851
He couldn't speak no foreign
languages... who is he kidding?

849
01:19:09,653 --> 01:19:12,144
I thought I saw his picture
on the post office.

850
01:19:12,322 --> 01:19:17,089
I don't remember if it was
on a wall or on a stamp.

851
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:20,229
- Do you remember Virgil?
- Oh, yeah.

852
01:19:20,397 --> 01:19:21,762
What was he like?

853
01:19:22,165 --> 01:19:25,464
Well, now I think he's brilliant.
I mean absolutely brilliant.

854
01:19:25,869 --> 01:19:28,861
When I just found out that
he was a criminal,

855
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:31,202
I just couldn't believe it...
I just thought I was gonna die.

856
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:35,338
Because he's a he just did
the best cover up job

857
01:19:35,412 --> 01:19:36,436
I have ever seen in my life.

858
01:19:36,713 --> 01:19:40,513
I mean unbelievable acting job.
I actually believed he was an idiot.

859
01:19:41,284 --> 01:19:43,582
I mean I really believed... and
I wasn't the only one... like

860
01:19:43,653 --> 01:19:46,121
everybody thought so... everyone
just thought he was a shemeal

861
01:19:46,222 --> 01:19:47,951
and it turns out that he's a criminal.

862
01:19:48,692 --> 01:19:51,957
Just to think that... that idiot was
a criminal I just can't believe it.

863
01:19:52,462 --> 01:19:56,262
I mean you never met anyone like this
...you'd never meet such a nothing.

864
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:59,734
I can't believe it, there was a mind
working in there.

865
01:19:59,803 --> 01:20:01,930
That could rob banks.
It's phenomenal.

866
01:20:02,806 --> 01:20:06,606
You know, once... once
I said to him what do you do

867
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:08,905
he said, uh, I rob banks.

868
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:10,673
Go no, right!

869
01:20:11,314 --> 01:20:13,009
But we finally caught up to him.

870
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:16,550
Oh I think it was April 11
when we finally captured Virgil.

871
01:20:17,387 --> 01:20:22,086
It sorta was a very odd circumstances,
uh, an amateur photography

872
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:24,057
happened to be there at the time.

873
01:20:25,562 --> 01:20:28,087
And, um, took the only known films
of his capture.

874
01:20:28,898 --> 01:20:32,163
I was coming down here. This is
the spot where it actually happened.

875
01:20:32,335 --> 01:20:35,532
You see, as a matter of fact,
I just brought my pants

876
01:20:35,605 --> 01:20:39,097
into the cleaners and
I was sorta angry with him.

877
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:41,234
Because last time I brought 'em
in I asked him to sew a button

878
01:20:41,344 --> 01:20:42,106
on it and they hadn't.

879
01:20:42,345 --> 01:20:43,676
Could you get to the point?

880
01:20:44,547 --> 01:20:49,712
Oh yes, well... I'll tell you exactly
what happened this morning,

881
01:20:49,853 --> 01:20:53,118
uh, with me... and about the camera.

882
01:20:53,957 --> 01:20:56,949
Well, back to this thing with
which I became known,

883
01:20:57,027 --> 01:20:59,518
mainly because of what had happened
and I happened to have the camera.

884
01:21:00,063 --> 01:21:05,023
I was having breakfast in the morning.
I think it was two fried eggs, a toas

885
01:21:05,835 --> 01:21:07,962
I don't know if it was orange juice
or grape fruit...

886
01:21:08,071 --> 01:21:10,801
but I remember I had a juice...
I don't remember what it was.

887
01:21:10,907 --> 01:21:12,465
But at that time...

888
01:21:13,009 --> 01:21:15,102
- it was orange juice... that's right!
- Can you get to the point!

889
01:21:15,745 --> 01:21:18,213
In fact, I got 'em right here.
I'd like to show them to you.

890
01:21:18,448 --> 01:21:22,475
The very last films of Virgil Starkwell
being captured by the FBI.

891
01:21:24,521 --> 01:21:26,318
Now get your hands up, it's a stickup!

892
01:21:27,223 --> 01:21:30,624
Hey, I know you... Virgil Starkwell...

893
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:35,359
Oh, Eddie... Haynes?

894
01:21:35,498 --> 01:21:38,058
That's right! We were
in the marching band together.

895
01:21:38,134 --> 01:21:39,601
You played the cello...
you were always...

896
01:21:39,736 --> 01:21:41,897
I was the trombone... first trombone.

897
01:21:42,105 --> 01:21:43,572
That's funny, my God!

898
01:21:44,007 --> 01:21:46,601
- What are you doing?
- I'm with the Philharmonic.

899
01:21:46,976 --> 01:21:50,070
No kidding, that's grand! I was just
talking to someone... Oscar Sunken

900
01:21:50,146 --> 01:21:52,842
about the great visory
we had together.

901
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:54,246
That was hilarious!

902
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:58,645
You remember when we got caught
taking a shower together?

903
01:21:59,055 --> 01:22:01,324
I do... I never saw anything
so embarrassed.

904
01:22:01,324 --> 01:22:02,723
I'll never forget your face.

905
01:22:03,159 --> 01:22:06,185
- My face? You dropped the towel.
- You dropped the towel too!

906
01:22:08,164 --> 01:22:10,428
- Can I have your watch?
- Sure, sure, sure.

907
01:22:12,736 --> 01:22:15,705
Remember we painted the car,
uh, yellow?

908
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:17,170
Yeah, it was Halloween.

909
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:19,104
Yeah that's right, it was Halloween.
It was really funny.

910
01:22:19,275 --> 01:22:21,766
- It was yellow stripes.
- That's right, like a popcorn.

911
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:25,213
Keep your hands up or
I'd have to shoot you.

912
01:22:26,549 --> 01:22:28,346
You remember the football game?

913
01:22:28,551 --> 01:22:31,111
- You fumbled the last play.
- And you picked up the ball.

914
01:22:31,254 --> 01:22:32,778
And then I ran the wrong way,

915
01:22:32,889 --> 01:22:35,084
and everyone was yelling
go back, go back.

916
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:36,420
And I thought they were cheering.

917
01:22:36,593 --> 01:22:38,720
You can't beat the good old days.

918
01:22:39,162 --> 01:22:41,357
There were good old nights...
Shirley Shivrotze.

919
01:22:42,799 --> 01:22:44,232
Wallet.

920
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,992
Oh I didn't hear you.

921
01:22:46,669 --> 01:22:48,694
Look it's been great speaking
to you, really.

922
01:22:48,805 --> 01:22:50,534
It's been nice to see you too Virgil.

923
01:22:50,707 --> 01:22:52,607
Yeah, take it easy.
Maybe we'll see each other someday.

924
01:22:52,675 --> 01:22:53,869
Good luck to you!

925
01:22:54,077 --> 01:22:56,705
Oh Virgil I just realized I'm a cop.

926
01:22:57,213 --> 01:22:59,875
- Oh Virgil I just realized I'm a cop.
- No kidding, how's it going?

927
01:23:00,049 --> 01:23:02,415
It's a great job.
I gotta pension and I...

928
01:23:02,552 --> 01:23:04,315
Do you remember when...?

929
01:23:05,722 --> 01:23:09,214
Virgil Starkwell is tried on 52
accounts of robbery

930
01:23:09,392 --> 01:23:12,555
and is sentenced to 800 years
in federal prison.

931
01:23:13,096 --> 01:23:15,496
At the trial, he tells
his lawyer confidently,

932
01:23:15,598 --> 01:23:18,965
that with good behavior he can cut
the sentence in half.

933
01:23:19,302 --> 01:23:22,863
Virgil, now that you are caught and
you are facing a very long prison,

934
01:23:22,939 --> 01:23:25,874
sentence, do you have any regrets
choosing a life of crime?

935
01:23:26,576 --> 01:23:30,068
I think that crime definitely
pays that uh,

936
01:23:30,213 --> 01:23:33,740
it's a great job, the hours are good
and you're your own boss

937
01:23:33,883 --> 01:23:38,377
and you travel a lot and you get
to meet interesting people.

938
01:23:39,022 --> 01:23:41,422
I just think it's a good job in general.

939
01:23:41,991 --> 01:23:44,858
What about your co-hosts,
what has ever happened to them?

940
01:23:44,961 --> 01:23:47,953
All of the men, many of the guys
you associated with in various gangs.

941
01:23:48,364 --> 01:23:53,324
A great many of them have
become a homosexuals

942
01:23:53,603 --> 01:23:56,766
and some of them have entered
in politics and sports.

943
01:23:57,140 --> 01:23:59,540
How do you manage to spend
your time in prison...

944
01:23:59,642 --> 01:24:00,973
do you have any hobbies?

945
01:24:01,211 --> 01:24:03,611
I do, I've been working on...

946
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:06,945
I've been doing a lot of stuff
in shop lately.

947
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:11,520
I'm very skilled with my hands.
Do you know if it's raining out?
