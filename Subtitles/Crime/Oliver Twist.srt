1
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:25,326
(Bell rings)

2
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:10,289
MAN: <i>Bow to the board.</i>

3
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,084
This is the boy.

4
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:16,754
Born here in the workhouse.

5
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:19,048
Moved to the parish farm.

6
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:20,758
Nine years old today.

7
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:22,969
Time to be moved back here.

8
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,554
What's your name, boy?

9
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,269
(Faintly) Oliver Twist.

10
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:33,229
- What, what?
- The boy's a fool.

11
00:03:33,271 --> 00:03:35,482
Boy, listen to me.

12
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:39,236
<i>- You know you are an orphan, I suppose?</i>
- What's that?

13
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:40,987
The boy is a fool. I thought he was.

14
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:45,117
You know you've got no father or mother
and that you were brought up by the parish?

15
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,369
<i>- Don't you?</i>
- Yes, sir.

16
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:49,079
What are you crying for?

17
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,707
I hope you say your prayers every night, hmm?

18
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,626
Pray for those that feed you
and take care of you.

19
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,295
Like a...

20
00:03:56,378 --> 00:03:58,088
- Like a Christian.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

21
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:03,803
Well, you have come here to be educated
and to be taught a useful trade.

22
00:04:35,502 --> 00:04:37,212
Learn from the boy next to you.

23
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:39,256
What am I to learn, sir?

24
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:41,550
Learn to pick out the oakum.

25
00:04:41,634 --> 00:04:43,510
What's oakum, sir?

26
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:46,305
Stop asking so many questions.

27
00:04:46,347 --> 00:04:49,100
Oakum's the fibres you unpick from the old rope.

28
00:04:50,184 --> 00:04:53,521
Then it's used again
for ships of Her Majesty's Navy.

29
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:56,274
You're serving your country.

30
00:04:56,357 --> 00:04:58,401
Now, get on with it.

31
00:05:32,603 --> 00:05:34,230
Tom, give it a rest, will you?

32
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:35,815
We're trying to sleep.

33
00:05:38,484 --> 00:05:40,528
Can't sleep. Too hungry.

34
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,196
We're all hungry.

35
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,740
<i>Yes, but I'm frightened.</i>

36
00:05:44,782 --> 00:05:46,409
Frightened? Why?

37
00:05:46,492 --> 00:05:48,119
Why?

38
00:05:48,203 --> 00:05:52,749
Why? I'm so hungry, I'm frightened I might eat
the lad that sleeps next to me.

39
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:30,955
MAN: <i>Oh, Lord God,</i>

40
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,125
for the blessing
of this generous and bountiful meal

41
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:36,085
that thou hast placed before us,

42
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:37,754
we give thanks.

43
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:39,381
Amen.

44
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:41,883
ALL: Amen!

45
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,883
(Softly) Yeah.

46
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:29,307
(Sharp intakes of breath)

47
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:04,928
Please, sir, I want some more.

48
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:07,931
What?

49
00:08:09,057 --> 00:08:11,518
Please, sir, I want some more.

50
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:24,990
Fetch the Beadle!

51
00:08:33,624 --> 00:08:35,251
Mr Limbkins.

52
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:36,961
<i>I beg your pardon, sir.</i>

53
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,715
Oliver Twist has asked for more.

54
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,426
For more?

55
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:46,679
Compose yourself, Mr Bumble,
and answer me distinctly.

56
00:08:46,763 --> 00:08:51,309
Do I understand that he asked for more
<i>after</i> he'd eaten supper?

57
00:08:51,392 --> 00:08:52,810
He did, sir.

58
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:58,775
That boy will be hanged.

59
00:09:06,408 --> 00:09:08,702
Whoa.

60
00:09:10,704 --> 00:09:12,748
£5 and a boy?

61
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:14,458
Whoa!

62
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,793
Whoa.

63
00:09:16,877 --> 00:09:18,504
When I says whoa...

64
00:09:18,587 --> 00:09:20,214
I means whoa!

65
00:09:20,297 --> 00:09:22,341
(Donkey brays)

66
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:25,344
(Reads) Healthy,

67
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:27,054
app...

68
00:09:27,138 --> 00:09:28,764
apprentice.

69
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:31,392
£5.

70
00:09:31,476 --> 00:09:34,979
Chimney sweeping is a nasty trade.

71
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:39,567
Young boys have been smothered in chimneys
before now.

72
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:42,946
That's because they damp the straw
afore they light it in the chimney

73
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:44,656
<i>to make 'em come out again.</i>

74
00:09:45,657 --> 00:09:48,743
Damp straw makes smoke.
Smoke sends the boy to sleep.

75
00:09:48,827 --> 00:09:50,454
That's what he wants.

76
00:09:50,537 --> 00:09:52,247
Boys is very lazy, gentlemen.

77
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:56,168
But there's nothing like a good, hot blaze
to make 'em come out in a run.

78
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:58,378
<i>It's humane, too.</i>

79
00:09:58,462 --> 00:10:02,383
Yes. Because even if they're stuck
in the chimney,

80
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:06,929
roasting their feet makes 'em struggle
to hextricate their selves.

81
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:09,473
Yes.

82
00:10:09,515 --> 00:10:11,976
I suppose he's fond of chimney sweeping?

83
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:14,020
He dotes on it, Your Worship.

84
00:10:14,061 --> 00:10:16,981
<i>Very well. I will sign the indentures...</i>

85
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:20,443
..to make him Mr...

86
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:24,614
..Mr Gamfield's apprentice.

87
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,493
(Oliver whimpers)

88
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:35,834
My boy.

89
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,423
My boy, you look pale and alarmed.

90
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:43,133
What's the matter?

91
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:46,637
Please, sir... Please, sir...

92
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,931
What is it, my boy?

93
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:50,891
OLIVER: <i>- Don't...</i>
- Now, then.

94
00:10:50,975 --> 00:10:52,601
Don't...

95
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:56,731
Go on, my boy. Don't what?

96
00:10:56,772 --> 00:10:59,692
Please don't send me away
with this dreadful man, sir.

97
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:02,904
Huh. Off all the designing orphans
that I've ever seen.

98
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:04,989
Hold your tongue, Beadle.

99
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:08,201
- Did Your Worship speak to me?
- Yes. Hold your tongue.

100
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,664
FIRST MAGISTRATE: <i>Out of the question.</i>

101
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:16,918
We refuse to sanction these indentures.

102
00:11:18,753 --> 00:11:20,380
Take the boy away.

103
00:11:20,464 --> 00:11:23,300
And treat him kindly.

104
00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:24,968
<i>He seems to want it.</i>

105
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:46,240
I've just taken the measure of the two women
that died last night, Mr Bumble.

106
00:11:46,324 --> 00:11:49,327
MR BUMBLE:
You'll make your fortune, Mr Sowerberry.

107
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:50,995
Think so?

108
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:56,209
The prices allowed by the board are very small.

109
00:11:56,251 --> 00:11:57,877
So are the coffins.

110
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,884
By the by, you don't know anybody
who wants a boy, do you?

111
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:08,764
Liberal terms, Mr Sowerberry.

112
00:12:08,847 --> 00:12:10,724
Liberal terms.

113
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:25,364
Now, as you are to meet your new master,
pull that cap off your eyes.

114
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:28,492
Hold your head up, sir.

115
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:33,706
Dry your eyes, sir.

116
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,877
(Bell rings)

117
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:39,587
Aha.

118
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:41,297
Is that you, Bumble?

119
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:43,758
No-one else, Mr Sowerberry.

120
00:12:43,842 --> 00:12:47,178
I brought the orphan, Oliver Twist.

121
00:12:47,262 --> 00:12:49,139
So this is the orphan, is it?

122
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:54,978
Mrs Sowerberry, will you have the goodness
to come here a moment, my dear?

123
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:57,731
Oliver Twist?

124
00:12:57,814 --> 00:13:00,192
How comes an orphan to have any name at all?

125
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:02,820
- I invented it.
- You, Mr Bumble?

126
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:04,530
Aye, Mr Sowerberry.

127
00:13:04,613 --> 00:13:07,783
I name all our foundlings in alphabetical order.

128
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:10,244
<i>The last was "S".</i>

129
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:11,954
"Swubble," I named him.

130
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:16,250
This was a "T". "Twist," I named him.

131
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:17,919
Next one as comes will be...

132
00:13:18,002 --> 00:13:20,963
"Unwin". And the next "Vilkins".

133
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:24,926
I've got names ready all through the alphabet,
right up to "Z".

134
00:13:24,968 --> 00:13:27,971
Why, you're quite a literary character, sir.

135
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:29,889
MR BUMBLE: Well, well.

136
00:13:29,973 --> 00:13:31,599
Perhaps I may be.

137
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:35,937
Mrs Sowerberry, this is the orphan
from the workhouse.

138
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:42,402
- Dear me, he's very small.
- But he'll grow, Mrs Sowerberry. He'll grow.

139
00:13:42,444 --> 00:13:44,071
Yes, I dare say he will...

140
00:13:44,154 --> 00:13:45,781
on <i>our</i> food and drink.

141
00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:50,285
Workhouse boys
always cost more to keep than they're worth.

142
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,747
Get downstairs, you bag of bones.

143
00:13:55,082 --> 00:13:59,628
Here, Charlotte, give this boy some
of the cold bits that were put by for the dog.

144
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:32,329
MRS SOWERBERRY: You don't mind
sleeping among the coffins, I suppose.

145
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:36,250
It doesn't matter much whether you do or don't.
You can't sleep anywhere else.

146
00:15:51,328 --> 00:15:53,038
(Cock crows)

147
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:54,706
(Banging)

148
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,417
BOY: <i>Open the door, will ya?</i>

149
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:09,722
<i>Are you the new boy?</i>

150
00:16:09,805 --> 00:16:11,432
Yes, sir.

151
00:16:11,515 --> 00:16:13,142
<i>How old are you?</i>

152
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:14,852
Ten, sir.

153
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:18,189
<i>Then I'll whop you one when I get in,</i>
<i>you workhouse brat.</i>

154
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:24,946
(Cock crows)

155
00:16:35,832 --> 00:16:37,959
I beg your pardon, sir. Did you knock?

156
00:16:38,043 --> 00:16:39,669
I kicked.

157
00:16:39,753 --> 00:16:41,379
Did you want a coffin, sir?

158
00:16:42,506 --> 00:16:45,133
- You don't know who I am, I suppose?
- No, sir.

159
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:47,052
Well, I'm Mr Noah Claypole.

160
00:16:47,094 --> 00:16:48,720
And you're under me.

161
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:50,431
Now, take down the shutters!

162
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:00,316
Saved a nice little bit of bacon for you
from the master's breakfast.

163
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,447
In the corner with you.

164
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:08,157
And be quick about it.

165
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:10,201
They want you to mind the shop.

166
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:11,869
Do you hear?

167
00:17:11,953 --> 00:17:14,163
Do you hear, Workhouse? In the corner.

168
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:16,416
CHARLOTTE: <i>O, Lor', Noah, let the boy alone.</i>

169
00:17:16,457 --> 00:17:18,084
Let him alone?

170
00:17:18,168 --> 00:17:20,045
Why, everybody's let him alone.

171
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:24,257
His mother, father,
and all his relations has let him alone.

172
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:27,135
<i>So, he needs someone who don't.</i>

173
00:17:27,177 --> 00:17:29,221
(They laugh)

174
00:17:30,555 --> 00:17:32,182
(Dog barks frantically)

175
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,494
Supper!

176
00:17:51,577 --> 00:17:53,621
Oliver, ain't you done yet?

177
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:56,666
<i>I've never known such an idle boy.</i>

178
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,751
<i>Get down them stairs.</i>

179
00:17:58,835 --> 00:18:00,545
<i>Mr Sowerberry!</i>

180
00:18:00,628 --> 00:18:02,255
Supper.

181
00:18:02,338 --> 00:18:04,966
<i>I've had a thought, my dear.</i>

182
00:18:05,008 --> 00:18:08,845
"Had a thought." You want to be careful,
Mr Sowerberry. You'll get brain fever.

183
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:10,555
It's about young Twist.

184
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:12,265
<i>What about him?</i>

185
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:14,476
A very good-looking boy.

186
00:18:14,518 --> 00:18:16,395
He will be. He eats enough.

187
00:18:16,436 --> 00:18:20,899
There's an expression of melancholy
in his face, my dear.

188
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:24,862
He would make a delightful mute, my love.

189
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:31,035
I-I don't mean a regular mute
to attend grown-up funerals, my dear.

190
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:34,288
But only for children's practice.

191
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:36,958
(Church bells ring)

192
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:50,764
Look at him.

193
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,350
<i>Look at him.</i>

194
00:18:54,476 --> 00:18:56,102
A workhouse boy and a sneak.

195
00:18:56,186 --> 00:18:57,813
Look at him.

196
00:18:57,896 --> 00:19:00,816
Mark my words, I'll see him hung.

197
00:19:00,857 --> 00:19:02,484
<i>Can't be too soon.</i>

198
00:19:05,863 --> 00:19:09,533
Workhouse...how's your mother?

199
00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:11,201
OLIVER: She's dead.

200
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:12,912
Oh.

201
00:19:12,995 --> 00:19:14,788
What did she die of, Workhouse?

202
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:19,919
Oh, are you gonna cry, Workhouse?

203
00:19:20,002 --> 00:19:21,879
What set you off?

204
00:19:21,921 --> 00:19:23,548
<i>Not you.</i>

205
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:28,094
Not me, eh?

206
00:19:28,136 --> 00:19:29,762
No, not you.

207
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:33,016
And you'd better not
say anything about my mother.

208
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:36,144
"Better not"?

209
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,730
About your mother?

210
00:19:39,773 --> 00:19:42,567
Well, I'm very sorry and I pity you very much,

211
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:46,863
but you must know, Workhouse,
your mother was a regular right down bad 'un.

212
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:51,201
What did you say?

213
00:19:51,285 --> 00:19:52,995
A regular right down bad 'un.

214
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:57,875
It's a good thing she died when she did
or she'd be hard-labouring or transported.

215
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:01,086
Or hung, which is most likely,
isn't it, Workhouse?

216
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:06,008
Help, Mrs Charlotte!

217
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,927
He'll murder me! Help!

218
00:20:09,387 --> 00:20:11,013
<i>Help! Get off!</i>

219
00:20:12,098 --> 00:20:13,349
For God's sake!

220
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:14,892
<i>Help me!</i>

221
00:20:14,934 --> 00:20:17,228
CHARLOTTE: Stop it, you beast! You animal!

222
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,230
NOAH: He's murdering me! Get off!

223
00:20:19,272 --> 00:20:20,899
Get off me now!

224
00:20:20,982 --> 00:20:22,609
I've got hold of him.

225
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:24,319
OLIVER: Let me near him!

226
00:20:24,402 --> 00:20:26,029
You workhouse devil.

227
00:20:26,112 --> 00:20:27,739
I'll learn you.

228
00:20:27,822 --> 00:20:29,449
You brat!

229
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:31,159
Get the door, Charlotte!

230
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:32,703
In with him.

231
00:20:41,712 --> 00:20:43,339
Very violent indeed, sir.

232
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:46,884
And the missus said,

233
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:51,430
"If Mr Bumble can spare the time,
then Mr Bumble's to flog him."

234
00:20:52,556 --> 00:20:54,433
Cos the master's out.

235
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:01,232
<i>In there.</i>

236
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:03,651
- Oliver!
<i>- Let me out of here!</i>

237
00:21:03,693 --> 00:21:05,737
Do you know this here voice, Oliver?

238
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,280
<i>Yes!</i>

239
00:21:07,322 --> 00:21:08,948
Aren't you afraid of it, sir?

240
00:21:09,032 --> 00:21:11,493
Ain't you trembling while I speak, sir?

241
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:13,787
<i>No!</i>

242
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:18,959
He must be mad.

243
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:21,253
- It's not madness, ma'am. It's meat.
<i>- Meat?</i>

244
00:21:21,295 --> 00:21:23,755
Meat, ma'am, meat. You've overfed him.

245
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:26,842
If you'd kept this boy on gruel,
this would never have happened.

246
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:30,304
Dear, dear. This comes of being liberal.

247
00:21:31,972 --> 00:21:33,432
What's all this?

248
00:21:33,474 --> 00:21:36,102
Oliver Twist has turned violent, Mr Sowerberry.

249
00:21:36,143 --> 00:21:38,104
Look what he's done to my eye, sir.

250
00:21:38,145 --> 00:21:39,772
(Banging)

251
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:45,236
Now, then. Now, then.

252
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:47,864
You're a nice young fellow, ain't you?

253
00:21:47,947 --> 00:21:50,408
He called my mother names.

254
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,369
And what if he did? You little ungrateful wretch.

255
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:55,455
She deserved what he said and worse.

256
00:21:55,538 --> 00:21:57,582
She didn't! It's a lie!

257
00:21:57,624 --> 00:21:59,251
(Gasps)

258
00:22:02,003 --> 00:22:04,047
Do something, Mr Sowerberry.

259
00:22:04,131 --> 00:22:06,174
<i>(Breathlessly) He called me a liar!</i>

260
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,845
Do something!

261
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:50,762
(Dog barks)

262
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,467
(Driver urges horses on)

263
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:26,966
(Dog yelps)

264
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:32,764
I...

265
00:25:34,348 --> 00:25:35,600
Er...

266
00:25:35,642 --> 00:25:37,268
I beg your pardon, miss.

267
00:25:38,353 --> 00:25:40,063
But would you be so kind...

268
00:25:41,564 --> 00:25:43,191
Get off my land.

269
00:25:43,274 --> 00:25:46,361
I don't want no beggars here! Go on!

270
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:48,071
Get off!

271
00:25:48,154 --> 00:25:49,781
Or I'll put the dog on you!

272
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:33,618
I haven't much,
but you're more than welcome to it.

273
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,247
Be careful. It's hot.

274
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:51,929
<i>Seeing you gave me such a turn.</i>

275
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:54,557
My eyes ain't what they were.

276
00:26:54,598 --> 00:26:55,850
But...

277
00:26:56,892 --> 00:26:59,020
I just thought for a moment...

278
00:27:07,737 --> 00:27:09,948
Why are you on the road at all?

279
00:27:10,031 --> 00:27:12,242
A little mite like you?

280
00:27:13,326 --> 00:27:16,121
<i>- Where are you headed?</i>
- London, ma'am.

281
00:27:16,162 --> 00:27:17,789
London.

282
00:27:18,915 --> 00:27:20,542
London.

283
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:22,252
Oh!

284
00:27:22,335 --> 00:27:24,546
Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

285
00:28:49,884 --> 00:28:51,511
Hello, my man.

286
00:28:52,846 --> 00:28:54,473
What's your game?

287
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:58,685
You're not from these parts?

288
00:29:00,521 --> 00:29:02,147
Where are you from, then?

289
00:29:04,775 --> 00:29:06,402
I've been walking...

290
00:29:06,485 --> 00:29:07,820
seven days.

291
00:29:07,861 --> 00:29:09,488
Seven days?

292
00:29:09,572 --> 00:29:12,491
Cor. I expect you want grub.

293
00:29:13,576 --> 00:29:15,286
And you shall have it.

294
00:29:15,328 --> 00:29:17,997
I'm at a low-water mark, myself,
just at the moment,

295
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,665
but I'll fork out and stump.

296
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,752
Come on, up with you. On your pins.

297
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,434
Oh, by the by,

298
00:29:37,517 --> 00:29:39,144
my name is Jack Dawkins,

299
00:29:39,227 --> 00:29:41,188
better known as the Artful Dodger.

300
00:29:41,271 --> 00:29:42,898
Oliver Twist.

301
00:29:44,441 --> 00:29:46,652
Why are you known as the Artful Dodger?

302
00:29:48,028 --> 00:29:49,655
That's why.

303
00:29:57,913 --> 00:29:59,540
Got any lodgings?

304
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:01,250
Money?

305
00:30:02,376 --> 00:30:05,796
I suppose you want some place to sleep tonight,
don't you?

306
00:30:46,088 --> 00:30:47,715
MAN: <i>Rag and bone!</i>

307
00:30:48,841 --> 00:30:51,844
I expect you walking for so long
was a beak's order.

308
00:30:51,886 --> 00:30:53,513
What's that mean?

309
00:30:53,596 --> 00:30:55,390
Don't you know what a "beak" is?

310
00:30:56,474 --> 00:30:58,101
A bird's mouth, isn't it?

311
00:30:58,184 --> 00:30:59,811
Cor, you are green.

312
00:30:59,894 --> 00:31:03,732
A beak's a magistrate, my son.
Where you been all your life?

313
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,533
WOMAN: <i>Come back here. I want to talk to you.</i>

314
00:31:24,044 --> 00:31:25,671
(Baby cries)

315
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,286
(Dodger whistles)

316
00:31:56,369 --> 00:31:58,747
BOY: <i>Now, then?</i>
DODGER: Plummy and slam.

317
00:32:00,457 --> 00:32:03,168
There's two of you. Who's he?

318
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,170
DODGER: <i>- A new pal.</i>
- Where'd he come from?

319
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:07,131
Greenland. Is the old 'un there?

320
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:08,882
<i>Upstairs, sorting the wipes.</i>

321
00:32:23,815 --> 00:32:25,441
(Whispers)

322
00:32:27,026 --> 00:32:28,653
This is him, Fagin.

323
00:32:28,736 --> 00:32:30,864
My new friend, Oliver Twist.

324
00:32:30,947 --> 00:32:32,574
Well, well...

325
00:32:32,657 --> 00:32:34,868
Oliver Twist.

326
00:32:34,951 --> 00:32:36,995
(Boys titter)

327
00:32:37,037 --> 00:32:40,373
I hope I have the honour
of a more intimate acquaintance.

328
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,418
We're very glad to see you, Oliver.

329
00:32:43,502 --> 00:32:46,672
Very. Dodger, take off the sausages.

330
00:32:46,713 --> 00:32:48,840
And let's make a space at the table...

331
00:32:48,924 --> 00:32:50,551
for Oliver.

332
00:32:51,677 --> 00:32:55,806
You are staring at the pocket handkerchiefs,
hey, my dear?

333
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:59,935
There's a good many of them, ain't there?
We just looked 'em out ready for the wash.

334
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:02,021
<i>That's all, my dear.</i>

335
00:33:03,105 --> 00:33:04,732
Blow it.

336
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,235
Hot.

337
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:11,614
<i>Now, then, Oliver.</i>

338
00:33:11,697 --> 00:33:14,701
What you must have is a hot gin and water.

339
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,578
Warms the cockles.

340
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:20,790
Only drink it quick, cos another
of these gentlemen wants the tumbler.

341
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,340
- (Hiccups)
- (Boys laugh)

342
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,981
He's such a nice lad.

343
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,610
<i>I have a feeling he'll
turn out a hard worker.</i>

344
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,570
<i>Yeah, a hard worker.</i>

345
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,766
Oliver.

346
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:22,437
Oliver?

347
00:35:18,662 --> 00:35:21,040
(Fagin gasps)

348
00:35:36,806 --> 00:35:38,433
Clever dogs.

349
00:35:44,314 --> 00:35:45,941
Clever dogs.

350
00:35:48,902 --> 00:35:50,153
Ah.

351
00:35:51,196 --> 00:35:52,823
Fine fellows.

352
00:35:56,744 --> 00:35:58,370
Ah, fine fellows.

353
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:04,752
(Lilting) Fine fellows.

354
00:36:05,795 --> 00:36:08,172
Fine fellows.

355
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:12,009
<i>Fine fellows.</i>

356
00:36:13,845 --> 00:36:16,139
Fine fellows.

357
00:36:21,895 --> 00:36:25,982
What do you watch me for? Why are you
awake? What have you seen? Speak out, boy!

358
00:36:26,024 --> 00:36:27,901
Quick! Quick! Or it's your life.

359
00:36:27,943 --> 00:36:30,487
I wasn't able to sleep any longer, sir.

360
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,197
I'm very sorry if I disturbed you.

361
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:34,282
- You were not awake a moment ago?
- No, sir.

362
00:36:34,366 --> 00:36:35,993
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

363
00:36:39,204 --> 00:36:41,832
Of course you were asleep, my dear.
I know that.

364
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:44,835
I only tried to frighten you.

365
00:36:44,918 --> 00:36:47,046
You're a brave boy, Oliver.

366
00:36:49,965 --> 00:36:52,677
Did you see any of those pretty things, my dear?

367
00:36:52,718 --> 00:36:54,345
- Yes, sir.
- Ah!

368
00:36:54,428 --> 00:36:56,055
They...

369
00:36:56,138 --> 00:36:57,765
They're mine, Oliver.

370
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,475
My little property.

371
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:01,185
For my old age.

372
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,771
It's our secret.

373
00:37:04,731 --> 00:37:06,149
You understand, my dear?

374
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:07,817
Yes, sir.

375
00:37:08,943 --> 00:37:10,737
Can I get up now, sir?

376
00:37:45,857 --> 00:37:47,567
MAN OUTSIDE: <i>Blimey!</i>

377
00:37:56,326 --> 00:37:58,787
I hope you've been at work this morning,
my dears.

378
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,330
<i>- Hard.</i>
<i>- As nails.</i>

379
00:38:00,372 --> 00:38:01,998
Good boys!

380
00:38:02,082 --> 00:38:03,542
Good boys.

381
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:05,043
What you got, Dodger?

382
00:38:05,085 --> 00:38:06,878
<i>- Couple of pocket books.</i>
- Lined?

383
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,547
Pretty well.

384
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:20,559
Oh.

385
00:38:21,685 --> 00:38:23,312
Dodge...

386
00:38:24,522 --> 00:38:26,148
<i>I don't know, Dodge.</i>

387
00:38:27,316 --> 00:38:28,943
Ah.

388
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:31,696
Well.

389
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:33,990
Not as heavy as they might be.

390
00:38:34,073 --> 00:38:35,700
But very neat.

391
00:38:35,783 --> 00:38:37,410
And nicely made.

392
00:38:39,454 --> 00:38:42,791
<i>- Ingenious workman, ain't he, Oliver?</i>
- Indeed, sir.

393
00:38:42,832 --> 00:38:46,086
And, Charley, what have you got, my dear?

394
00:38:46,169 --> 00:38:48,380
- Wipes.
- Wipes?

395
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:55,220
They're very good ones.

396
00:38:55,304 --> 00:38:56,930
Oh, very...

397
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,604
You haven't marked them well.

398
00:39:04,813 --> 00:39:07,358
The marks should be picked out with a needle.

399
00:39:07,441 --> 00:39:09,985
And we'll teach Oliver how to do it.

400
00:39:10,027 --> 00:39:12,697
<i>- Shall us, Oliver?</i>
- If you please, sir.

401
00:39:12,738 --> 00:39:16,492
You'd like to make pocket handkerchiefs
as easy as Charley Bates, wouldn't you?

402
00:39:16,576 --> 00:39:19,287
Very much indeed, if you'll teach me, sir.

403
00:39:19,329 --> 00:39:21,539
I never met anyone so green.

404
00:39:33,093 --> 00:39:34,719
(Mutters)

405
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:40,976
Now, then, boys.

406
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:42,686
The game.

407
00:39:44,855 --> 00:39:49,318
We'll show Oliver
how to make pocket handkerchiefs.

408
00:39:51,028 --> 00:39:53,823
You'd like to play a game, wouldn't you, Oliver?

409
00:39:53,864 --> 00:39:55,491
Yes, sir.

410
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:24,813
(Fakes a groan)

411
00:41:20,537 --> 00:41:22,665
BOY: <i>Got the time, guv?</i>

412
00:41:22,706 --> 00:41:24,166
It's er...

413
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:25,835
eight o'clock.

414
00:41:35,511 --> 00:41:37,889
Playing the game, were we, Fagin?

415
00:41:37,972 --> 00:41:39,849
As is our custom, my dear.

416
00:41:39,891 --> 00:41:41,935
He's new. Who's he?

417
00:41:42,018 --> 00:41:43,645
<i>Oh, this is Oliver.</i>

418
00:41:43,728 --> 00:41:45,355
<i>Oliver,</i>

419
00:41:45,438 --> 00:41:49,276
these are our very good friends, Bet and Nancy.

420
00:41:52,571 --> 00:41:55,032
See, Dodger, you want to learn from him.

421
00:41:55,073 --> 00:41:56,700
He's got manners, he has.

422
00:41:56,783 --> 00:41:58,243
Proper gentleman.

423
00:41:58,327 --> 00:42:01,747
Fagin, we popped in
because we're that cold inside.

424
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,375
As is your custom, my dear.

425
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:05,292
Charley.

426
00:42:05,334 --> 00:42:06,961
Come on, Oliver, join us.

427
00:42:07,044 --> 00:42:10,005
Or don't you sit with the common folk?

428
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:15,261
Now, you want to be careful of this lot, Oliver.
He'll have you picking...

429
00:42:15,303 --> 00:42:20,516
Picking out the marks. That's what we
was teaching him, ain't it, Oliver, my dear?

430
00:42:20,558 --> 00:42:22,185
- Yes, sir.
<i>- "Yes, sir"?</i>

431
00:42:22,268 --> 00:42:25,146
You know who you're talking to, do you?

432
00:42:25,188 --> 00:42:27,941
What's your mother got to say
about you being here, Oliver?

433
00:42:28,024 --> 00:42:30,735
I haven't got a mother. I'm an orphan.

434
00:42:30,777 --> 00:42:32,404
You're in the right company, then.

435
00:42:35,574 --> 00:42:38,034
Come on, Oliver, I'll teach you how to play.

436
00:42:38,118 --> 00:42:40,078
It's called Spec or Speculation.

437
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,747
Three cards each.

438
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,624
And then, the one he turns up...

439
00:42:43,665 --> 00:42:45,292
is trumps.

440
00:42:54,468 --> 00:42:56,846
This is a pleasant life, ain't it, my dear?

441
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:03,686
When can I go out, sir?

442
00:43:03,769 --> 00:43:06,397
FAGIN: <i>Soon. Soon.</i>

443
00:43:06,439 --> 00:43:08,066
Let's...

444
00:43:09,192 --> 00:43:10,985
Let's see what you've learned.

445
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,696
Would you like that?

446
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,407
Oh, yes, sir.

447
00:43:16,533 --> 00:43:18,243
See if you can take this out...

448
00:43:19,786 --> 00:43:21,413
..without my feeling it.

449
00:43:48,774 --> 00:43:50,401
Is it gone?

450
00:43:52,779 --> 00:43:55,073
You're a clever boy, my dear.

451
00:43:56,157 --> 00:43:58,284
I never saw a sharper lad.

452
00:44:05,041 --> 00:44:06,751
Here's a shilling for you.

453
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,881
Make the Dodger and Charley your models.

454
00:44:10,922 --> 00:44:14,509
Especially the Dodger, my dear.
He'll be a great man himself.

455
00:44:14,593 --> 00:44:16,220
Make you one, too.

456
00:44:16,303 --> 00:44:20,432
If you go on this way,
you'll be the greatest man of the time.

457
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:23,435
Oh...

458
00:44:23,477 --> 00:44:25,354
Thank you very much, sir.

459
00:44:29,692 --> 00:44:31,319
(Traders shout)

460
00:45:40,557 --> 00:45:42,851
Thief! Your handkerchief, sir.

461
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:44,353
Stop, thieves!

462
00:45:49,983 --> 00:45:51,568
Thief!

463
00:45:55,781 --> 00:45:57,408
Him!

464
00:45:57,491 --> 00:45:59,118
Thief!

465
00:46:03,372 --> 00:46:04,999
Thief!

466
00:46:16,928 --> 00:46:18,555
<i>Stop, thief!</i>

467
00:46:40,869 --> 00:46:42,830
(Babble of distorted voices)

468
00:46:44,415 --> 00:46:45,583
Where's the gentleman?

469
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:47,043
I hope they hang him.

470
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:51,380
- He's scared to death.
- He's putting it on.

471
00:46:51,422 --> 00:46:53,966
- Where's the gentleman?
- Here's the gentleman now.

472
00:46:54,008 --> 00:46:55,968
<i>Is this the boy, sir?</i>

473
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,805
- Yes, I'm afraid it is.
- "Afraid it is"? That's a good 'un.

474
00:46:58,846 --> 00:47:00,431
Did you hear him? "Afraid it is"?

475
00:47:00,473 --> 00:47:02,684
- He's hurt himself.
- I did that, sir.

476
00:47:02,725 --> 00:47:05,019
Hurt my knuckle agin his mouth.

477
00:47:05,103 --> 00:47:07,147
But I stopped him.

478
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:10,483
- Get up!
- It wasn't me, sir. It wasn't me.

479
00:47:10,525 --> 00:47:12,986
Course it wasn't. It never is.

480
00:47:13,028 --> 00:47:14,821
- Now, get up.
- Don't hurt him.

481
00:47:14,863 --> 00:47:17,157
Oh, no, sir, I won't hurt him.

482
00:47:22,704 --> 00:47:23,956
This way, gentlemen.

483
00:47:25,082 --> 00:47:26,709
What's next?

484
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:28,669
That is my name and address, sir.

485
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:30,337
Officer, who is this fellow?

486
00:47:30,379 --> 00:47:33,799
- My name, sir, is Brownlow.
<i>- Hold your tongue!</i>

487
00:47:33,883 --> 00:47:36,594
Officer, what's this fellow charged with?

488
00:47:36,636 --> 00:47:39,096
Oh, no, no. He's not charged, Your Worship.

489
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,557
- He appears against the boy.
<i>- Swear him.</i>

490
00:47:41,641 --> 00:47:44,102
Before I am sworn, I must beg to say one word.

491
00:47:44,185 --> 00:47:46,729
<i>- Hold your tongue, sir!</i>
- I will not, sir!

492
00:47:46,771 --> 00:47:48,565
Hold your tongue this instant!

493
00:47:48,606 --> 00:47:50,984
You're an insolent, impertinent fellow.

494
00:47:51,067 --> 00:47:53,528
- How dare you bully a magistrate?
- What?

495
00:47:53,612 --> 00:47:56,323
Swear this person. I'll not hear another word.

496
00:47:56,364 --> 00:48:00,744
I do solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

497
00:48:00,786 --> 00:48:02,829
Now, what's the charge against the boy?

498
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:05,624
- I was standing at a book store...
- Hold your tongue!

499
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:08,627
Where's the policeman? What is this?
Are there any witnesses?

500
00:48:08,669 --> 00:48:10,295
None, Your Worship.

501
00:48:10,379 --> 00:48:12,339
The boy is ill.

502
00:48:12,381 --> 00:48:14,008
Oh, yes, I dare say.

503
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:17,178
Come along, you vagabond!
None of your tricks here.

504
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:19,138
<i>- What's your name?</i>
- Water.

505
00:48:19,221 --> 00:48:21,682
What's your name, you hardened scoundrel?

506
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:24,310
Officer, what's his name?

507
00:48:24,393 --> 00:48:25,645
What's your name, boy?

508
00:48:25,728 --> 00:48:28,648
Some water. Some water.

509
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:31,401
He says his name is Sam Waters, Your Worship.

510
00:48:31,442 --> 00:48:34,529
<i>- Where does he live?</i>
- Where do you live? Anywhere he can.

511
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:38,325
Stuff and nonsense.
Don't try to make a fool out of me.

512
00:48:38,366 --> 00:48:40,827
No, no, I think he really is ill, Your Worship.

513
00:48:40,911 --> 00:48:42,621
<i>I know better or my name's not Fang.</i>

514
00:48:43,497 --> 00:48:45,874
Stand away, Officer. He's shamming.

515
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:50,587
He stands committed for three months.
Hard labour, of course. Clear the office.

516
00:48:50,671 --> 00:48:53,841
Stop. Stop. Stop. Don't take him away.

517
00:48:53,882 --> 00:48:56,552
What is this? Who is this? Turn this man out.

518
00:48:56,593 --> 00:48:58,220
I will not be turned out!

519
00:48:58,304 --> 00:48:59,930
I will speak!

520
00:49:00,014 --> 00:49:02,892
I saw it all. I own the bookshop.

521
00:49:02,933 --> 00:49:05,811
<i>- I demand to be heard.</i>
- Well, what have you got to say?

522
00:49:05,853 --> 00:49:08,856
- It was not this boy.
<i>- Not this boy? Who was it, then?</i>

523
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:12,610
The robbery was committed by two other boys
while the gentleman was reading.

524
00:49:12,652 --> 00:49:15,613
I saw it done.
I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed by it.

525
00:49:15,655 --> 00:49:17,115
Why didn't you come before?

526
00:49:17,156 --> 00:49:19,033
I hadn't a soul to mind the shop.

527
00:49:19,117 --> 00:49:20,743
Reading, you say.

528
00:49:20,827 --> 00:49:22,620
A book, I suppose.

529
00:49:22,704 --> 00:49:24,831
Yes, the very one he has in his hand.

530
00:49:25,916 --> 00:49:27,626
Dear me, I forgot all about it.

531
00:49:27,709 --> 00:49:29,336
Well, you're a nice one.

532
00:49:29,419 --> 00:49:31,880
To prefer a charge against an innocent boy.

533
00:49:33,423 --> 00:49:35,050
I consider, sir,

534
00:49:35,133 --> 00:49:39,596
that you've obtained that book under very
suspicious and disreputable circumstances.

535
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,931
Damn me!

536
00:49:40,973 --> 00:49:43,350
Do you want to press charges
against this fellow?

537
00:49:43,434 --> 00:49:45,019
Certainly not.

538
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:50,107
Well, you may think yourself fortunate
that the owner of the book declines to prosecute.

539
00:49:50,191 --> 00:49:52,318
<i>The boy is discharged. Clear the office.</i>

540
00:49:52,401 --> 00:49:55,404
- Damn me!
- Clear the office! Clear the office!

541
00:49:55,488 --> 00:49:57,115
Next case.

542
00:49:58,241 --> 00:50:00,201
Come on. Move along, sir, please.

543
00:50:00,243 --> 00:50:01,869
Just move along, sir.

544
00:50:01,953 --> 00:50:03,580
There's a good gentleman, sir.

545
00:50:03,663 --> 00:50:05,707
Hold on, Harry. I'll give you a hand.

546
00:50:10,629 --> 00:50:12,589
OFFICER: <i>Make way for the law, sir.</i>

547
00:50:14,382 --> 00:50:16,009
Careful with him.

548
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:21,265
- Call a coach, pray.
- Right away, sir.

549
00:50:21,306 --> 00:50:22,933
I'm sorry.

550
00:50:23,016 --> 00:50:24,643
Oh. (Chuckles)

551
00:50:24,726 --> 00:50:26,186
Poor boy.

552
00:50:31,233 --> 00:50:33,194
- Mind yourself, madam.
- Thank you, sir.

553
00:50:34,236 --> 00:50:36,197
- Got one, sir.
<i>- Thank you, Officer.</i>

554
00:50:37,323 --> 00:50:38,950
Let me, sir.

555
00:50:43,162 --> 00:50:45,540
- Could you drop me off, sir?
- Of course.

556
00:50:46,916 --> 00:50:48,084
Right...

557
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:50,211
If you could just take his head, sir.

558
00:50:51,921 --> 00:50:54,215
- Where to, sir?
- Pentonville.

559
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,010
Pentonville.

560
00:50:58,845 --> 00:51:01,765
Answer me, where is he?
What's become of the boy? Speak out

561
00:51:01,807 --> 00:51:05,477
- or I'll throttle you!
- The traps have got him! Let go of me, will ya!

562
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:14,945
Bull's-eye!

563
00:51:15,029 --> 00:51:16,655
Who pitched this here at me?

564
00:51:16,739 --> 00:51:18,282
Who done it?

565
00:51:20,534 --> 00:51:23,245
Bull's-eye. Come here, you sneaking varmint.

566
00:51:23,287 --> 00:51:25,331
What you stopping outside for?

567
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:28,417
Lay down.

568
00:51:29,502 --> 00:51:31,129
(Whimpers and growls)

569
00:51:31,212 --> 00:51:33,256
<i>What you up to, Fagin?</i>

570
00:51:33,339 --> 00:51:34,883
<i>I'll-treating the boys again?</i>

571
00:51:34,924 --> 00:51:37,927
I wonder they don't murder you.
I would if I was them.

572
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,637
Shh!

573
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,348
Don't speak so loud.

574
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,058
You seem out of sorts, Bill.

575
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:45,769
Give us a drink, and mind you don't poison it.

576
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,437
(Laughs) Charley.

577
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,147
Good stuff, Bill.

578
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:54,152
So, Dodger, what's it all about?

579
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,821
The new boy.

580
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:58,365
Come out with us before he was rightly up to it.

581
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,075
<i>Got nabbed by the traps.</i>

582
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:01,785
You see, Bill,

583
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:05,956
I'm afraid he may say something
which will get us into trouble.

584
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,251
You're blowed upon, Fagin.

585
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:11,963
And about time.

586
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:15,216
And I'm afraid, you see, Bill,
that if the game were up with us,

587
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:19,053
it would come out rather worse for you
than it would for me, my dear.

588
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:21,973
BILL: <i>There's only one thing for it.</i>

589
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:25,435
Somebody's got to find out at the office
what's being done to him.

590
00:52:25,477 --> 00:52:27,937
Somebody's got to get hold of him somehow.

591
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:31,316
I ain't going near no police office.
Not for nobody, no how.

592
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:35,570
I have it, the very thing.
Bet will go, won't you, my dear?

593
00:52:35,612 --> 00:52:37,239
I'm blessed if I will.

594
00:52:37,322 --> 00:52:39,783
Nancy, my dear, what do you say?

595
00:52:39,867 --> 00:52:42,536
It won't do. There's no use in trying it on, Fagin.

596
00:52:42,578 --> 00:52:44,705
- What do you mean by that?
<i>- What I say, Bill.</i>

597
00:52:44,788 --> 00:52:48,459
You're just the very person for it.
Nobody knows anything about you.

598
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,795
And as I don't want 'em to neither.

599
00:52:50,836 --> 00:52:53,214
It's rather more no than yes with me, Bill.

600
00:52:53,297 --> 00:52:55,007
She'll go, Fagin.

601
00:52:55,091 --> 00:52:58,261
- No, she won't, Fagin.
<i>- Yes, she will, Fagin.</i>

602
00:53:02,306 --> 00:53:03,933
(Sniffles)

603
00:53:07,854 --> 00:53:09,981
Can I help you, miss?

604
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:12,567
I'm looking for my little brother.

605
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:14,361
Now, who would he be?

606
00:53:14,444 --> 00:53:16,071
A lovely little boy.

607
00:53:16,154 --> 00:53:19,241
Lovely manners. Gentle as falling snow.

608
00:53:19,324 --> 00:53:20,951
We don't get many of those.

609
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:24,413
I think you'll be wanting Mr Fang's court.

610
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:32,588
George.

611
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:34,798
This young lady's looking for her brother.

612
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:37,968
I think he's the one that fainted
and managed to get away with it.

613
00:53:38,052 --> 00:53:40,429
- Gentleman took him away.
- What gentleman?

614
00:53:40,513 --> 00:53:42,556
Gracious heavens, what gentleman?

615
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,100
Well...

616
00:53:44,141 --> 00:53:45,852
Lives in Pentonville, I believe.

617
00:53:45,935 --> 00:53:47,562
Oh, my gawd.

618
00:53:47,645 --> 00:53:50,565
No, no, wait, wait, wait...

619
00:53:50,607 --> 00:53:52,233
His card's here somewhere.

620
00:54:02,118 --> 00:54:03,745
Thank you, sir.

621
00:55:03,849 --> 00:55:05,476
Mr Brownlow!

622
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:07,186
Mr Brownlow...

623
00:55:35,715 --> 00:55:40,095
There's something in him
that touched my heart, Mrs Bedwin.

624
00:55:40,178 --> 00:55:42,139
I can't explain it.

625
00:55:43,265 --> 00:55:45,476
I feel the same, sir.

626
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:48,270
Who is he? What is he?

627
00:55:48,354 --> 00:55:49,980
You know nothing of him.

628
00:55:50,064 --> 00:55:52,733
He had a fever. What of that?

629
00:55:52,775 --> 00:55:55,653
Bad people have fevers sometimes.

630
00:55:55,694 --> 00:55:59,115
I knew a man in Jamaica who was
hanged for murdering his master.

631
00:55:59,156 --> 00:56:01,033
He had a fever six times!

632
00:56:01,117 --> 00:56:03,411
I know there is goodness in him.

633
00:56:03,453 --> 00:56:06,164
<i>- How do you know it?</i>
- Goodness and innocence.

634
00:56:06,205 --> 00:56:09,709
<i>- I knew it the first moment I saw him.</i>
- He'll deceive you.

635
00:56:09,751 --> 00:56:14,047
Let you down at the first opportunity,
like all your other good and innocent causes.

636
00:56:14,089 --> 00:56:17,258
If that boy is good and innocent,
I'll eat my own head, sir.

637
00:56:27,477 --> 00:56:29,104
How do you feel, my dear?

638
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:31,857
Very happy, sir.

639
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:34,151
And very grateful to you indeed, sir.

640
00:56:34,193 --> 00:56:35,819
Good boy.

641
00:56:35,903 --> 00:56:38,697
Have we given him any nourishment, Bedwin?

642
00:56:38,739 --> 00:56:40,366
<i>Any slops?</i>

643
00:56:40,449 --> 00:56:42,076
Not slops, sir.

644
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:43,953
Broth.

645
00:56:43,995 --> 00:56:48,291
A couple of glasses of port wine
would have done him a great deal more good.

646
00:56:48,332 --> 00:56:50,042
Wouldn't they, Sam?

647
00:56:51,127 --> 00:56:52,712
My name is Oliver, sir.

648
00:56:52,754 --> 00:56:54,380
"Oliver"?

649
00:56:55,506 --> 00:56:57,133
Oliver what? Oliver Waters?

650
00:56:57,217 --> 00:56:59,594
No, sir. Twist. Oliver Twist.

651
00:57:00,637 --> 00:57:03,556
Why did you tell the magistrate
your name was Waters?

652
00:57:03,598 --> 00:57:05,308
I never told him so, sir.

653
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:06,977
You did not?

654
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,687
<i>No, sir.</i>

655
00:57:12,399 --> 00:57:14,610
- You're not angry with me, are you, sir?
<i>- No.</i>

656
00:57:15,736 --> 00:57:17,362
Queer name.

657
00:57:17,446 --> 00:57:18,781
Oliver Twist.

658
00:57:20,282 --> 00:57:23,452
There are a great many books,
are there not, my boy?

659
00:57:23,536 --> 00:57:25,246
<i>A great number, sir.</i>

660
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:27,957
I never saw so many.

661
00:57:31,085 --> 00:57:35,256
How would you like to grow up a clever man
and <i>write</i> books, hmm?

662
00:57:35,298 --> 00:57:37,258
I think I'd rather read them, sir.

663
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,760
Oh.

664
00:57:38,801 --> 00:57:40,929
Wouldn't you like to be a book writer?

665
00:57:42,055 --> 00:57:45,141
I think it'd be a better thing
to be a book seller, sir.

666
00:57:47,769 --> 00:57:50,605
You have said a very good thing.

667
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:54,693
Well, well. We won't make an author of you

668
00:57:54,735 --> 00:57:58,906
while there's an honest trade to be learned
or brick-making to turn to.

669
00:57:58,947 --> 00:58:01,158
Are you going to send me away, sir?

670
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,826
No, my dear child.

671
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:05,704
You need not be afraid
that I'm going to desert you.

672
00:58:05,746 --> 00:58:07,373
Unless you give me cause.

673
00:58:07,456 --> 00:58:09,750
- I never, never will, sir.
- I hope not.

674
00:58:09,792 --> 00:58:12,503
Because I feel strongly disposed to trust you.

675
00:58:12,545 --> 00:58:14,505
Thank you, sir.

676
00:58:23,723 --> 00:58:26,267
I'm pleased I won't have to wear those again.

677
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:28,144
MRS BEDWIN: So are we all, my dear.

678
00:58:30,105 --> 00:58:31,731
There.

679
00:58:54,588 --> 00:58:56,215
(Man whistles)

680
00:59:28,915 --> 00:59:30,542
MAN: <i>Hello.</i>

681
00:59:30,626 --> 00:59:32,252
<i>What's that?</i>

682
00:59:32,336 --> 00:59:34,713
MR BROWNLOW: <i>This is young Oliver Twist.</i>

683
00:59:34,755 --> 00:59:40,511
- Sir, the book seller's boy brought a package.
- Stop him. There's some books to go back.

684
00:59:40,553 --> 00:59:42,179
Is that the boy who had the fever?

685
00:59:42,263 --> 00:59:43,806
<i>That's the boy.</i>

686
01:00:10,834 --> 01:00:13,045
No sign of him, sir.

687
01:00:13,086 --> 01:00:15,047
Oh, dear. I'm very sorry for that.

688
01:00:15,088 --> 01:00:17,883
I particularly wished some books
to be returned tonight.

689
01:00:17,925 --> 01:00:21,011
Send Oliver with them.
He'll be sure to deliver them safely.

690
01:00:21,095 --> 01:00:25,099
Yes, do let me take them.
If you please, sir. I'll run all the way.

691
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,444
You shall go, my dear.

692
01:00:36,485 --> 01:00:38,613
<i>Ask Mrs Bedwin to show you the way.</i>

693
01:00:38,696 --> 01:00:40,323
<i>And Oliver?</i>

694
01:00:41,407 --> 01:00:42,951
Yes, sir.

695
01:00:42,992 --> 01:00:44,619
Give the book seller this.

696
01:00:48,289 --> 01:00:49,916
The money I owe him.

697
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,301
I won't be long, sir.

698
01:01:00,677 --> 01:01:03,055
How long do you think it'll take him?

699
01:01:03,096 --> 01:01:05,724
You really expect him to come back, do you?

700
01:01:05,766 --> 01:01:07,393
You don't?

701
01:01:07,476 --> 01:01:11,230
<i>With a five-pound note in his pocket?</i>
<i>No, I do not.</i>

702
01:01:11,272 --> 01:01:15,735
<i>If ever that boy returns to this house,</i>
<i>I'll eat my own head, sir.</i>

703
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:19,363
And yours.

704
01:01:36,339 --> 01:01:38,300
Oh, my little brother!

705
01:01:38,341 --> 01:01:39,968
OLIVER: <i>No, no!</i>

706
01:01:40,051 --> 01:01:41,553
<i>Help!</i>

707
01:01:41,595 --> 01:01:43,221
It's a miracle.

708
01:01:43,305 --> 01:01:44,931
I found him. I found him.

709
01:01:45,015 --> 01:01:47,059
Oh, Oliver, Oliver.

710
01:01:47,142 --> 01:01:48,602
Nancy?

711
01:01:48,644 --> 01:01:52,481
You're such a naughty boy to make me
suffer such distress on your account.

712
01:01:52,564 --> 01:01:54,441
What's the matter, ma'am?

713
01:01:54,483 --> 01:01:56,110
He ran away from his parents,

714
01:01:56,193 --> 01:01:58,320
hard-working, respectable people,

715
01:01:58,404 --> 01:02:01,115
and joined a set of thieves and bad characters.

716
01:02:01,157 --> 01:02:02,783
Broke his mother's heart.

717
01:02:02,867 --> 01:02:04,201
<i>Young wretch.</i>

718
01:02:04,243 --> 01:02:05,870
Go home, you little brute.

719
01:02:05,953 --> 01:02:09,290
I haven't got any parents. I'm an orphan.
I live in Pentonville.

720
01:02:09,332 --> 01:02:11,793
Only hear him how he braves it out.

721
01:02:11,876 --> 01:02:14,253
- What? Young Oliver!
OLIVER: <i>- It's true!</i>

722
01:02:16,297 --> 01:02:18,258
You come home to your poor mother!

723
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:21,386
I don't belong to them! I don't know them!
Help! Help!

724
01:02:21,469 --> 01:02:22,929
"Help? Help?"

725
01:02:22,971 --> 01:02:25,682
I'll give you "Help! Help!" you little wretch!

726
01:02:25,724 --> 01:02:27,350
And these books!

727
01:02:27,434 --> 01:02:31,021
Have you been astealing them, have you, eh?

728
01:02:31,104 --> 01:02:32,731
You little villain!

729
01:02:32,814 --> 01:02:36,652
That's right. You give it to him.
Only way to bring him to his senses.

730
01:02:36,693 --> 01:02:39,697
I will, missus!
You come with me, you little wretch!

731
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:41,407
WOMAN: <i>It'll do him good.</i>

732
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:43,117
OLIVER: Who is this man?

733
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,827
BILL: Mind him, Bull's-eye!

734
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:46,370
OLIVER: Help! Help!

735
01:02:48,873 --> 01:02:50,750
Look at him, Fagin!

736
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,460
Hold me, somebody.

737
01:02:53,544 --> 01:02:55,838
Hold me, somebody, while I laugh it out.

738
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,924
Look at his togs, Fagin!

739
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:00,635
Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear.

740
01:03:00,677 --> 01:03:03,763
Why didn't you write, my dear,
and say you was coming?

741
01:03:03,847 --> 01:03:06,224
We'd have got something warm for supper.

742
01:03:07,892 --> 01:03:10,270
Hello, Fagin. What's that? That's mine, Fagin!

743
01:03:10,312 --> 01:03:13,064
No, my dear. Mine, Bill, mine.
You shall have the books.

744
01:03:13,106 --> 01:03:17,152
If that ain't mine and Nancy's, I'll take
the boy back again. Come on. Hand over.

745
01:03:17,194 --> 01:03:19,738
This is hardly fair, Bill, hardly fair.
Is it, Nancy?

746
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:22,699
Fair or not fair, hand over, I tell ya.

747
01:03:22,741 --> 01:03:25,911
Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton!

748
01:03:25,995 --> 01:03:30,457
Give it here! That's for our share of the trouble.
Not half enough neither.

749
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:34,378
<i>You may keep the books if you're</i>
<i>fond of reading. If you ain't, sell 'em.</i>

750
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:36,047
They're very pretty.

751
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:38,341
Beautiful writing, isn't it, Oliver?

752
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:41,719
Send them back. They belong to Mr Brownlow.

753
01:03:41,761 --> 01:03:43,888
Send them back, the books and the money.

754
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:46,140
<i>He'll think I stole them.</i>

755
01:03:46,182 --> 01:03:49,602
- Please send them back.
- The boy's right. You're right, Oliver.

756
01:03:49,644 --> 01:03:51,604
They will think you've stolen 'em.

757
01:03:52,689 --> 01:03:55,859
It couldn't have happened better
if we'd chosen our time.

758
01:03:55,942 --> 01:03:57,569
Help! Help! Police!

759
01:04:00,197 --> 01:04:01,990
Keep back the dog, Bill.

760
01:04:02,032 --> 01:04:04,409
- He'll tear the boy to pieces.
- Serve him right.

761
01:04:04,493 --> 01:04:06,453
Help! Fetch the police!

762
01:04:06,537 --> 01:04:08,163
<i>Fetch the police!</i>

763
01:04:08,247 --> 01:04:11,041
Step aside or I'll split your head against the wall.

764
01:04:11,083 --> 01:04:16,213
I don't care. That child shan't be torn down
by the dog unless you kill me first.

765
01:04:17,506 --> 01:04:19,133
<i>Bull's-eye! Here!</i>

766
01:04:19,175 --> 01:04:20,968
Bull's-eye!

767
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:29,394
FAGIN: Dodger!

768
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,146
Get after him!

769
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,384
Hey! (Laughs)

770
01:05:00,467 --> 01:05:01,468
Hey!

771
01:05:10,228 --> 01:05:12,605
So you wants to get away, my dear, did you?

772
01:05:12,647 --> 01:05:15,024
Wanted to call for the police, did you?

773
01:05:15,108 --> 01:05:16,818
We'll soon cure you of that.

774
01:05:19,487 --> 01:05:22,240
I won't stand by and see this done, Fagin!

775
01:05:22,282 --> 01:05:24,993
You've got the boy. What more do you want?

776
01:05:25,035 --> 01:05:28,288
Keep quiet, Nancy,
or I'll quieten you for a good long time to come.

777
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:29,956
Let him be! Let him be!

778
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:32,751
You're a fine one for the boy to make a friend of.

779
01:05:32,793 --> 01:05:34,920
NANCY:
<i>God Almighty, help me, I am.</i>

780
01:05:35,003 --> 01:05:38,841
He's a thief, a liar, a devil,
all that's bad from this night forth.

781
01:05:38,924 --> 01:05:41,552
Ain't that enough for the old wretch
without blows?

782
01:05:41,593 --> 01:05:44,138
Come, come, we must have civil words.
Civil words.

783
01:05:44,221 --> 01:05:45,848
Civil words?

784
01:05:45,931 --> 01:05:47,641
Civil words? You old villain!

785
01:05:47,725 --> 01:05:50,895
I thieved for you
when I was a child not half as old as this!

786
01:05:50,978 --> 01:05:52,605
It's your living.

787
01:05:52,688 --> 01:05:56,025
Yes, and you're the wretch that drove me to it.

788
01:05:56,067 --> 01:05:59,153
And who will keep me at it day and night
until I die!

789
01:06:02,865 --> 01:06:04,492
Dodger.

790
01:06:04,576 --> 01:06:06,870
Charley. Put Oliver to bed.

791
01:06:06,911 --> 01:06:10,915
Best to take them clothes off first.
They're too good to sleep in.

792
01:06:10,957 --> 01:06:13,335
<i>This suit cost more than four pence ha'penny.</i>

793
01:06:13,376 --> 01:06:16,463
I never felt such lovely stuff. Have you, Dodger?

794
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:17,923
Not me.

795
01:06:17,964 --> 01:06:21,385
I'm willing to lay odds this is the same stuff
the queen wears on Sundays.

796
01:06:21,426 --> 01:06:23,470
(Boys laugh)

797
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:27,057
Quick, get him.

798
01:06:27,141 --> 01:06:28,684
Take it off.

799
01:06:31,395 --> 01:06:33,022
<i>Lift him up.</i>

800
01:06:33,105 --> 01:06:34,732
Up he goes.

801
01:06:34,815 --> 01:06:37,109
(Barking)

802
01:06:38,486 --> 01:06:40,196
<i>Get them shoes off.</i>

803
01:06:58,298 --> 01:06:59,925
(Bells ring)

804
01:07:15,858 --> 01:07:18,611
Little something for your luncheon, my dear?

805
01:07:35,461 --> 01:07:37,505
Shall we have a little chat?

806
01:07:37,589 --> 01:07:39,215
<i>Oliver?</i>

807
01:07:40,341 --> 01:07:41,968
<i>Shall us?</i>

808
01:07:44,846 --> 01:07:46,473
I expect you'd welcome...

809
01:07:47,808 --> 01:07:51,395
..the sound of a human voice again,
eh, my dear?

810
01:07:57,151 --> 01:07:58,777
D'you know...

811
01:07:59,903 --> 01:08:03,407
..what I consider
the greatest sin in the world, my dear?

812
01:08:05,075 --> 01:08:06,702
Ingratitude.

813
01:08:09,246 --> 01:08:10,957
That's what you're guilty of.

814
01:08:12,041 --> 01:08:13,668
Ingratitude.

815
01:08:13,751 --> 01:08:15,711
We took you in, we cherished you.

816
01:08:15,753 --> 01:08:17,797
If we hadn't, you might have died of hunger.

817
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:21,509
And how do you repay us? You run away.
You cry out for the police.

818
01:08:21,551 --> 01:08:23,845
You cause us great anxiety and expense.

819
01:08:29,059 --> 01:08:31,019
There was a lad once just like you.

820
01:08:31,061 --> 01:08:33,438
I was a father to him. He ran away like you.

821
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:36,983
He indeed went to the police
and can you guess how he ended up?

822
01:08:40,529 --> 01:08:42,156
They hanged him.

823
01:08:43,282 --> 01:08:44,908
At the Old Bailey.

824
01:08:46,577 --> 01:08:50,956
Certain evidence was made available,
not all of it precisely true, but...

825
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:57,797
..all of it necessary to provide for my own safety
and that of my friends.

826
01:08:58,923 --> 01:09:00,550
Yeah. Poor boy.

827
01:09:01,676 --> 01:09:03,302
Hanged.

828
01:09:04,429 --> 01:09:06,806
It's a terrible thing, hanging, Oliver.

829
01:09:06,848 --> 01:09:08,725
Dawn. The gallows.

830
01:09:08,766 --> 01:09:10,810
The rope. The noose.

831
01:09:11,895 --> 01:09:14,522
You don't always have to be guilty,
you see, Oliver.

832
01:09:14,564 --> 01:09:18,610
They hang you for anything these days,
because they're so very fond of hanging.

833
01:09:28,287 --> 01:09:29,913
But if you do as you're told,

834
01:09:31,248 --> 01:09:33,125
we'll be very good friends yet.

835
01:09:43,719 --> 01:09:45,930
You must feel free to walk about now, Oliver.

836
01:09:49,142 --> 01:09:50,935
<i>Yes, feel free.</i>

837
01:09:57,901 --> 01:09:59,319
Here, Oliver.

838
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:00,987
<i>Yes?</i>

839
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:04,074
I'd like you to assist me
in my toilet straight away.

840
01:10:05,158 --> 01:10:07,202
Will you do that for me, my man?

841
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:09,454
All right. I'll be glad of the company.

842
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:11,123
There's a good fellow.

843
01:10:11,206 --> 01:10:13,750
You may start by japanning my trotter cases.

844
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:17,087
In plain English, clean my boots.

845
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,260
What a pity he ain't a prig.

846
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:25,262
He don't know what's good for him.

847
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:27,932
'Spose you don't even know what a prig is.

848
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,600
Yes, I do. It's a...

849
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:31,310
It's a...

850
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,020
thief.

851
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:34,897
You're one, aren't you?

852
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:36,566
Yes, I am. And so we all are.

853
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:39,652
Down to the dog.
And he's the downiest one of the lot.

854
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:41,613
And the least given to peaching.

855
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:45,575
He wouldn't so much as bark in a witness box
for fear of committing himself.

856
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:48,411
He's an out-and-out Christian, he is.

857
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:51,248
Why don't you put yourself under Fagin, Oliver?

858
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:53,500
You'll make a fortune out of hand.

859
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:55,919
Like your old gentleman in Pentonville.

860
01:10:55,961 --> 01:10:57,588
Big house that.

861
01:10:57,671 --> 01:10:59,298
I had a peep at it, I did.

862
01:10:59,381 --> 01:11:01,425
Nice inside, was it?

863
01:11:01,467 --> 01:11:02,926
Yes.

864
01:11:02,968 --> 01:11:06,055
And I slept in a proper bed in my own room.

865
01:11:06,096 --> 01:11:07,723
Good stuff on the walls, eh?

866
01:11:07,806 --> 01:11:09,433
<i>Yes, indeed.</i>

867
01:11:09,517 --> 01:11:11,143
Put yourself under Fagin

868
01:11:11,227 --> 01:11:15,523
and you'll be able to retire to a property
just like that.

869
01:11:15,606 --> 01:11:17,233
And do the genteel.

870
01:11:17,316 --> 01:11:19,610
No. He's scared he'll come to be scragged.

871
01:11:19,694 --> 01:11:21,404
I don't know what that means.

872
01:11:25,116 --> 01:11:28,453
<i>If you don't take pocket handkerchiefs</i>
<i>and watches, nolly,</i>

873
01:11:28,536 --> 01:11:31,956
some other cove will. And you have
the same right to them as they have.

874
01:11:31,998 --> 01:11:34,751
To be sure. To be sure.

875
01:11:34,834 --> 01:11:37,796
It all lies in a nutshell, my dear. In a nutshell.

876
01:11:37,838 --> 01:11:42,551
Take the Dodger's word for it.
He understands the catechism of his trade.

877
01:11:53,437 --> 01:11:55,064
Cabbie.

878
01:12:15,001 --> 01:12:16,628
I've come from Bill.

879
01:12:16,711 --> 01:12:18,338
For what?

880
01:12:18,421 --> 01:12:20,048
For no harm.

881
01:12:20,131 --> 01:12:21,758
I don't believe it.

882
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:26,638
If I could help you, I would,
but I've not the power.

883
01:12:26,722 --> 01:12:29,641
Now, I've promised him
you'll be good and silent.

884
01:12:29,683 --> 01:12:32,227
If you're not, you'll only do yourself harm.

885
01:12:32,311 --> 01:12:33,937
And me, too.

886
01:12:44,532 --> 01:12:46,158
Did he come quiet?

887
01:12:46,242 --> 01:12:47,869
Like a lamb.

888
01:12:50,872 --> 01:12:52,498
Sit down.

889
01:12:58,254 --> 01:12:59,881
Let me read you a lecture.

890
01:13:06,638 --> 01:13:08,515
You know what this is?

891
01:13:08,598 --> 01:13:10,225
Yes.

892
01:13:10,308 --> 01:13:12,602
<i>Well, then.</i>

893
01:13:15,814 --> 01:13:17,441
This is powder.

894
01:13:25,825 --> 01:13:27,451
That here's a bullet.

895
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:33,040
And this is a little bit of an old hat...

896
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:35,751
..for wadding.

897
01:13:42,091 --> 01:13:43,968
Now it's loaded.

898
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:46,054
Yes. I can see it is, sir.

899
01:13:47,514 --> 01:13:51,518
If you speak a word when you're out of doors
with me, unless I speak to you,

900
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:55,397
this loading will go in your head without notice.

901
01:13:55,439 --> 01:13:59,526
So, if you do make up your mind
to speak without leave,

902
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,612
says your prayers first.

903
01:14:01,653 --> 01:14:04,198
NANCY:
<i>The short and long of what you mean is,</i>

904
01:14:04,281 --> 01:14:08,994
if you're crossed by him, you'll prevent him ever
telling tales by shooting him through the head.

905
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,748
And you'll take your chances swinging for it.

906
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:16,460
That's it. Women always put things
in the fewest words.

907
01:14:16,502 --> 01:14:18,796
Supper, Nancy.

908
01:14:18,838 --> 01:14:21,132
And then a snooze afore starting.

909
01:14:48,911 --> 01:14:50,329
MAN: <i>Aha!</i>

910
01:14:50,370 --> 01:14:51,997
My pal Bill!

911
01:14:52,081 --> 01:14:54,041
The door's open! Come in!

912
01:14:57,169 --> 01:14:59,046
(Whispers) Don't make such a row!

913
01:15:03,009 --> 01:15:04,969
Show us a glim, Toby.

914
01:15:05,011 --> 01:15:07,221
Barney, a glim. Show the gentleman in.

915
01:15:08,514 --> 01:15:11,768
Barney! Wake up first, if convenient!

916
01:15:24,364 --> 01:15:25,991
Mr Sykes.

917
01:15:26,074 --> 01:15:27,451
Come in, sir, come in.

918
01:15:45,886 --> 01:15:49,056
Bill, my boy. Glad to see ya.

919
01:15:50,641 --> 01:15:52,101
Who's um...

920
01:15:52,143 --> 01:15:53,561
Who's this?

921
01:15:53,603 --> 01:15:55,063
Only the boy.

922
01:15:55,104 --> 01:15:56,731
One of Mr Fagin's lads?

923
01:15:56,814 --> 01:15:58,274
Yeah. It's time.

924
01:15:58,316 --> 01:15:59,943
Right.

925
01:16:01,069 --> 01:16:02,862
Barkers for me, Barney.

926
01:16:11,413 --> 01:16:12,831
They're loaded.

927
01:16:12,873 --> 01:16:14,666
Good.

928
01:16:22,341 --> 01:16:24,385
- The persuaders?
- Got 'em.

929
01:16:29,473 --> 01:16:31,434
Keys. Centre bits.

930
01:16:35,354 --> 01:16:36,522
Darkies.

931
01:16:48,117 --> 01:16:49,369
Nothing forgotten?

932
01:16:50,912 --> 01:16:52,539
Ah!

933
01:17:01,048 --> 01:17:02,716
(Whispers) It's all quiet.

934
01:17:41,006 --> 01:17:42,674
(Thunder)

935
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:55,062
OLIVER: <i>I can't.</i>

936
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:56,772
I can't.

937
01:17:56,814 --> 01:17:58,482
You will.

938
01:17:58,524 --> 01:18:00,651
It's Mr Brownlow's house.

939
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:33,560
Have mercy! Don't make me steal from him!
Have mercy on me!

940
01:18:33,602 --> 01:18:35,062
Come here!

941
01:18:35,103 --> 01:18:39,399
For God's sake, let me run away
and die in a field. I'll never come near London.

942
01:18:39,441 --> 01:18:41,110
Shut it!

943
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:44,071
Get up. Or I'll strew your brains on the grass.

944
01:19:26,156 --> 01:19:27,950
I'm putting you through there.

945
01:19:27,992 --> 01:19:30,911
Go to the front door and unfasten it.

946
01:19:30,953 --> 01:19:34,498
I can't. There's a bolt at the top.
I know it. I can't reach it.

947
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:36,625
Well, stand on a chair or something.

948
01:19:36,667 --> 01:19:38,336
Just do it.

949
01:20:35,311 --> 01:20:36,980
BILL: To the door!

950
01:20:37,021 --> 01:20:38,732
To the front door, damn you!

951
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:42,277
MRS BEDWIN: <i>Who's there?</i>

952
01:20:43,862 --> 01:20:45,489
MR BROWNLOW: <i>Mrs Bedwin?</i>

953
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:47,532
<i>Is that you?</i>

954
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,178
Save me! Save me! Save me! For God's sake!

955
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:19,440
MRS BEDWIN: <i>Help!</i>

956
01:21:19,482 --> 01:21:21,526
<i>Help!</i>

957
01:21:21,568 --> 01:21:22,986
<i>Police!</i>

958
01:21:32,245 --> 01:21:33,914
Give him here!

959
01:21:40,212 --> 01:21:41,964
God damnation, how he bleeds!

960
01:21:42,005 --> 01:21:44,883
- Is he hit bad?
- He's gotta be hit worse.

961
01:21:50,097 --> 01:21:52,433
- Give me a pistol!
- What?

962
01:21:53,517 --> 01:21:56,520
BILL: We've got to get rid of him or he'll squeal.

963
01:21:56,562 --> 01:21:58,064
We've got to do him in.

964
01:21:58,105 --> 01:21:59,774
Here, here!

965
01:21:59,816 --> 01:22:01,484
Down here by the river!

966
01:22:01,526 --> 01:22:03,027
TOBY: <i>Bill! Bill!</i>

967
01:22:06,614 --> 01:22:08,741
- Bill!
<i>- Help!</i>

968
01:22:09,826 --> 01:22:13,038
Help! Help!

969
01:22:13,079 --> 01:22:14,748
Oh, Bill!

970
01:22:14,789 --> 01:22:16,458
BILL: <i>Help!</i>

971
01:22:24,925 --> 01:22:26,593
CHARLEY: <i>Snap.</i>

972
01:22:27,678 --> 01:22:29,346
Snap.

973
01:22:31,473 --> 01:22:32,516
Snap!

974
01:22:35,561 --> 01:22:37,229
<i>Snap.</i>

975
01:22:37,271 --> 01:22:39,357
(Bull's-eye whimpers)

976
01:22:39,398 --> 01:22:41,067
<i>Snap!</i>

977
01:22:55,206 --> 01:22:57,292
Well.

978
01:22:57,333 --> 01:22:59,169
How are you, Fagey?

979
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:01,963
(Bull's-eye barks)
- Scarce!

980
01:23:02,005 --> 01:23:03,632
<i>Scarce!</i>

981
01:23:03,673 --> 01:23:05,300
<i>Where's Bill?</i>

982
01:23:05,342 --> 01:23:07,344
- He's bleeding.
- What happened?

983
01:23:07,386 --> 01:23:09,054
All in good time.

984
01:23:09,096 --> 01:23:12,558
I can't talk business till I've ate and drank.

985
01:23:19,982 --> 01:23:21,650
Nancy, I said, scarce.

986
01:23:21,692 --> 01:23:23,068
Scarce!

987
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:24,570
Where's Bill?

988
01:23:24,612 --> 01:23:26,739
Produce the sustenance, if you please.

989
01:23:26,781 --> 01:23:28,449
Dodger.

990
01:23:28,491 --> 01:23:30,201
Nancy, scarce!

991
01:23:36,874 --> 01:23:39,586
- The crack failed.
<i>- I smelt that.</i>

992
01:23:39,627 --> 01:23:42,547
For the last time of asking, where's Bill?

993
01:23:44,341 --> 01:23:45,383
Dodger.

994
01:23:48,553 --> 01:23:51,098
Put him to bed. Give him a nip of gin.

995
01:23:58,814 --> 01:24:00,983
The boy was about to blow on us, Fagey.

996
01:24:02,067 --> 01:24:03,736
He was seen.

997
01:24:03,777 --> 01:24:06,238
Seen? He was seen? Who saw him?

998
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:08,532
Two old 'uns.

999
01:24:08,574 --> 01:24:10,242
He shouted out.

1000
01:24:10,284 --> 01:24:12,662
Bill lost his head. Fired his pistol.

1001
01:24:12,703 --> 01:24:13,871
And hit the boy?

1002
01:24:13,913 --> 01:24:16,833
I dunno. There was two shots.
Only one was Bill's.

1003
01:24:17,917 --> 01:24:21,546
We made a run for it.
I had hold of the boy and Bill fell.

1004
01:24:21,587 --> 01:24:23,506
Fell? Was he hurt?

1005
01:24:23,548 --> 01:24:25,216
No.

1006
01:24:25,258 --> 01:24:27,051
Last seen he was swimming to London.

1007
01:24:29,471 --> 01:24:31,139
Hold up.

1008
01:24:34,643 --> 01:24:36,937
BILL: <i>I told you not to bring a soul here.</i>

1009
01:24:36,978 --> 01:24:38,730
<i>Now you've brought the devil.</i>

1010
01:24:39,815 --> 01:24:41,483
You said to fetch him.

1011
01:24:41,525 --> 01:24:44,445
His fever's that high, he don't remember nothing.

1012
01:24:45,487 --> 01:24:48,282
You're not well, are you, Bill?
How do you feel today?

1013
01:24:48,324 --> 01:24:50,409
I'm as weak as water.

1014
01:24:51,493 --> 01:24:53,204
Get us a drink.

1015
01:24:54,288 --> 01:24:57,041
<i>What evil wind has blowed you here?</i>

1016
01:24:57,083 --> 01:24:58,751
No evil wind, my dear.

1017
01:24:58,793 --> 01:25:00,253
(Chuckles)

1018
01:25:00,294 --> 01:25:03,548
You, Bill. You...you said we need to speak.

1019
01:25:08,636 --> 01:25:11,264
What have you done with that boy?
Where is he?

1020
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:13,892
Safe and sound. The Dodger's minding him.

1021
01:25:13,933 --> 01:25:16,603
They're as close as Cain and Abel.

1022
01:25:20,524 --> 01:25:22,192
What about the boy, Bill?

1023
01:25:26,363 --> 01:25:28,782
We don't want anyone peaching on us, do we?

1024
01:25:28,824 --> 01:25:31,660
As long as that boy's alive,
we're as good as hung.

1025
01:25:31,702 --> 01:25:33,370
FAGIN: So what's to be done?

1026
01:25:35,539 --> 01:25:36,916
Nuffink.

1027
01:25:36,957 --> 01:25:38,626
"Nuffink."

1028
01:25:38,667 --> 01:25:40,669
- Not till I'm better.
- Then what?

1029
01:25:42,004 --> 01:25:44,882
- Then I'll do for him.
- How, Bill? Where?

1030
01:25:44,924 --> 01:25:46,676
Outside of London somewhere.

1031
01:25:46,717 --> 01:25:48,803
I'll find a river and I'll drown him.

1032
01:25:48,845 --> 01:25:50,513
The boy is weak.

1033
01:25:50,555 --> 01:25:54,017
Bill, he was wounded.
He can hardly stand, let alone walk.

1034
01:25:54,058 --> 01:25:56,436
When he can walk, tell me. I'll fetch him.

1035
01:25:58,313 --> 01:25:59,939
Now get out of here!

1036
01:25:59,981 --> 01:26:01,441
Yes.

1037
01:26:02,484 --> 01:26:03,777
Yes.

1038
01:26:04,861 --> 01:26:06,488
<i>Bill,</i>

1039
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:08,198
you're right.

1040
01:26:11,618 --> 01:26:13,328
It's for the best.

1041
01:26:17,249 --> 01:26:18,917
I'm burning up.

1042
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,962
Give me my physic. Where's my physic?

1043
01:26:24,131 --> 01:26:26,759
<i>You look like a corpse
come back to life again.</i>

1044
01:26:26,801 --> 01:26:28,469
<i>What's the matter?</i>

1045
01:26:28,511 --> 01:26:30,179
Nothing.

1046
01:26:31,222 --> 01:26:33,057
What do you look at me so hard for?

1047
01:26:33,099 --> 01:26:34,809
What are you thinking of?

1048
01:26:34,851 --> 01:26:37,562
Of many things, Bill. What's in that?

1049
01:26:37,603 --> 01:26:39,272
<i>I'll tell you what it is.</i>

1050
01:26:39,314 --> 01:26:43,568
If you haven't caught the fever, then
there's something more than usual in the wind.

1051
01:26:43,610 --> 01:26:45,612
And something dangerous, too!

1052
01:26:47,739 --> 01:26:49,407
<i>Give me my physic, I say.</i>

1053
01:26:52,869 --> 01:26:55,080
No, no, no.

1054
01:26:56,289 --> 01:26:58,917
There ain't a stauncher-hearted girl going.

1055
01:27:00,002 --> 01:27:02,504
Or I'd have cut her throat three months ago.

1056
01:27:05,007 --> 01:27:06,759
She's got the fever coming on.

1057
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,677
That's it.

1058
01:27:29,824 --> 01:27:32,202
Here you are. It'll make you feel better.

1059
01:27:39,835 --> 01:27:41,503
<i>Sit aside me.</i>

1060
01:27:44,423 --> 01:27:48,051
Put on your own face
or I'll alter it so you won't know it again.

1061
01:27:55,017 --> 01:27:57,353
(Bill sighs)

1062
01:28:05,027 --> 01:28:06,696
(Snoring)

1063
01:28:21,336 --> 01:28:22,879
(Bill stirs)

1064
01:29:13,473 --> 01:29:15,142
Wait.

1065
01:29:33,577 --> 01:29:34,829
Yes?

1066
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:36,539
Does Mr Brownlow live here?

1067
01:29:36,581 --> 01:29:38,458
Who are you? What do you want?

1068
01:29:38,499 --> 01:29:40,168
Go round the back.

1069
01:29:40,209 --> 01:29:42,503
I have information about Oliver Twist.

1070
01:29:46,841 --> 01:29:49,219
Is he all right? Is he safe?

1071
01:29:50,303 --> 01:29:51,972
Where is he?

1072
01:29:52,013 --> 01:29:53,807
I will only talk to Mr Brownlow.

1073
01:29:53,849 --> 01:29:55,517
He's not here.

1074
01:29:56,810 --> 01:29:59,312
The boy is innocent. Tell him that.

1075
01:29:59,354 --> 01:30:01,523
Where is he?

1076
01:30:01,565 --> 01:30:03,233
Safe.

1077
01:30:04,526 --> 01:30:06,737
But he may not be for long.

1078
01:30:06,779 --> 01:30:08,113
Where is he?

1079
01:30:19,584 --> 01:30:21,252
Give Mr Brownlow a message.

1080
01:30:21,294 --> 01:30:24,922
Tell him to meet me on Sunday at midnight
on London bridge.

1081
01:30:24,964 --> 01:30:26,299
Midnight?

1082
01:30:26,341 --> 01:30:30,094
And if I'm not there, tell him to come
the next night and the next.

1083
01:30:30,136 --> 01:30:31,805
I'll be there. Tell him.

1084
01:30:38,562 --> 01:30:40,897
There, my dear. You look as good as new.

1085
01:30:42,524 --> 01:30:44,192
How do you feel?

1086
01:30:44,234 --> 01:30:45,902
Tired, sir.

1087
01:30:46,987 --> 01:30:48,655
Well, yes, it is...

1088
01:30:48,697 --> 01:30:50,365
long after midnight.

1089
01:30:50,407 --> 01:30:52,409
Shortly you'll sleep a good sleep,

1090
01:30:52,451 --> 01:30:55,746
but my meaning was
how do you feel in yourself, Oliver?

1091
01:30:55,788 --> 01:30:57,831
Better. Thank you, sir.

1092
01:30:57,873 --> 01:30:59,542
But for the ache in my arm.

1093
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:01,252
Come sit.

1094
01:31:04,839 --> 01:31:08,801
I have the very thing
for such pains as yours, my dear.

1095
01:31:10,678 --> 01:31:12,347
Undo the bandage.

1096
01:31:19,312 --> 01:31:20,980
<i>Ah!</i>

1097
01:31:23,358 --> 01:31:25,861
Oh, my God!

1098
01:31:25,902 --> 01:31:28,071
It's a nasty wound.

1099
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:34,161
But my magic will do the trick,
you'll see, my dear.

1100
01:31:34,203 --> 01:31:36,663
This remedy...

1101
01:31:36,705 --> 01:31:38,373
is older than time.

1102
01:31:38,415 --> 01:31:41,251
Yes, my dear, older than time.

1103
01:31:41,293 --> 01:31:44,421
It was handed down from father to son.

1104
01:31:44,463 --> 01:31:46,215
Father to son.

1105
01:31:47,258 --> 01:31:48,926
And comes from...

1106
01:31:51,053 --> 01:31:52,805
..who can say where?

1107
01:31:56,642 --> 01:31:58,311
Thank you, sir.

1108
01:31:58,353 --> 01:31:59,812
Thank you...

1109
01:31:59,854 --> 01:32:01,522
for your kindness.

1110
01:32:01,564 --> 01:32:03,233
I'll always remember it.

1111
01:32:03,274 --> 01:32:05,402
Well...

1112
01:32:07,529 --> 01:32:09,197
Always.

1113
01:32:09,239 --> 01:32:10,907
Yes, always, my dear.

1114
01:32:14,286 --> 01:32:16,621
But who knows how long that will be?

1115
01:32:23,212 --> 01:32:25,297
(Bell chimes 11 times)

1116
01:32:45,610 --> 01:32:47,654
An hour this side of midnight.

1117
01:32:48,696 --> 01:32:50,365
Dark and heavy it is, too.

1118
01:32:51,408 --> 01:32:53,159
Good night for business, this.

1119
01:32:53,201 --> 01:32:57,706
Ah, what a pity, Bill, my dear,
there's none quite ready to be done.

1120
01:32:57,747 --> 01:32:59,541
For once you're right.

1121
01:32:59,583 --> 01:33:02,794
<i>So, when will the boy be well enough</i>
<i>to go on his travels, then?</i>

1122
01:33:02,836 --> 01:33:05,380
FAGIN: <i>Like I say, Bill, in a day or two.</i>

1123
01:33:05,422 --> 01:33:07,090
BILL: <i>It's a pity.</i>

1124
01:33:07,132 --> 01:33:08,801
For I'm in the humour too.

1125
01:33:08,842 --> 01:33:10,677
Does me good to hear you.

1126
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:14,390
You're like yourself tonight, Bill, eh?
Quite like yourself.

1127
01:33:14,431 --> 01:33:18,310
Well, I don't feel like myself when you lay
that withered old claw on my shoulder,

1128
01:33:18,352 --> 01:33:20,021
so take it away!

1129
01:33:28,321 --> 01:33:30,406
Hello, Nance.

1130
01:33:30,448 --> 01:33:32,909
And where's the girl going to this time of night?

1131
01:33:32,951 --> 01:33:34,619
Not far.

1132
01:33:34,661 --> 01:33:37,038
<i>What answer's that? Where are you going?</i>

1133
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:38,748
I say, not far.

1134
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:41,126
<i>- And I say where?</i>
- I dunno where.

1135
01:33:41,167 --> 01:33:42,836
<i>Then I do. Nowhere.</i>

1136
01:33:42,878 --> 01:33:44,546
<i>Sit down.</i>

1137
01:33:44,588 --> 01:33:46,423
I'm not well. I want a breath of air.

1138
01:33:46,465 --> 01:33:48,133
Put your head out the window.

1139
01:33:48,175 --> 01:33:51,511
There's not enough there. I want it in the street.

1140
01:33:51,553 --> 01:33:53,222
(Bull's-eye growls)

1141
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:56,809
Then you won't have it.

1142
01:34:02,815 --> 01:34:06,402
There. Now stop quietly where you are, will ya?

1143
01:34:12,533 --> 01:34:14,327
Do you know what you're doing?

1144
01:34:15,411 --> 01:34:17,080
Do I know what I'm...?

1145
01:34:17,121 --> 01:34:20,875
I think this girl's lost her senses.
Are you talking to me in that way?

1146
01:34:20,917 --> 01:34:25,213
You'll drive me on to something desperate!
Now, let me go, will ya? This minute!

1147
01:34:25,255 --> 01:34:26,798
<i>- This instant!</i>
- No!

1148
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:28,300
Tell him to let me go, Fagin.

1149
01:34:28,341 --> 01:34:30,302
<i>It'll be better for him.</i>

1150
01:34:30,343 --> 01:34:32,304
Do you hear me?

1151
01:34:33,388 --> 01:34:35,057
Aye.

1152
01:34:35,098 --> 01:34:36,767
I hear ya.

1153
01:34:37,851 --> 01:34:40,562
And if I have to listen to you
for half a minute longer,

1154
01:34:40,604 --> 01:34:45,025
the dog will have such a grip on your throat
as he'll tear some of that screaming voice out!

1155
01:34:45,067 --> 01:34:47,570
What's come over you, you jade? What is it?

1156
01:34:47,611 --> 01:34:50,239
(Tearfully) Bill, let me go!

1157
01:34:50,281 --> 01:34:52,366
Let me go!

1158
01:34:52,408 --> 01:34:54,368
You don't know what you're doing.

1159
01:34:54,410 --> 01:34:56,120
Look, for only one hour.

1160
01:34:56,162 --> 01:35:00,666
Cut my limbs off one by one if I don't
think the girl's stark raving mad. Get up.

1161
01:35:00,708 --> 01:35:02,377
Get up!

1162
01:35:02,418 --> 01:35:03,711
No!

1163
01:35:03,753 --> 01:35:04,462
Argh!

1164
01:35:05,964 --> 01:35:07,632
(Nancy squeals and whimpers)

1165
01:35:10,510 --> 01:35:12,262
BILL: <i>Now stay there!</i>

1166
01:35:14,389 --> 01:35:16,850
What a precious strange girl that is.

1167
01:35:16,892 --> 01:35:19,102
You may say that, Bill, you may say that.

1168
01:35:19,144 --> 01:35:22,356
What do you think she took it
in her head to go out tonight for?

1169
01:35:22,397 --> 01:35:24,817
Obstinacy. Women's obstinacy, I suppose.

1170
01:35:24,858 --> 01:35:26,527
I thought I tamed her of that.

1171
01:35:26,568 --> 01:35:28,404
She's as bad as ever.

1172
01:35:30,531 --> 01:35:34,368
I think she's got a touch of my fever
in her blood yet and it won't come out.

1173
01:35:34,410 --> 01:35:36,078
Like enough.

1174
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:39,123
If she's taken that way again,
I'll let her a little blood.

1175
01:35:39,165 --> 01:35:41,209
Without troubling the doctor!

1176
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:42,835
(Door opens)

1177
01:35:42,877 --> 01:35:44,962
(Nancy laughs happily)

1178
01:35:57,225 --> 01:35:59,477
Why, now she's on the other tack.

1179
01:35:59,519 --> 01:36:01,188
(Nancy giggles)

1180
01:36:01,229 --> 01:36:02,898
Good night.

1181
01:36:02,939 --> 01:36:07,277
In two days, Bill, come for the boy.

1182
01:36:07,319 --> 01:36:09,238
(Nancy chuckles)

1183
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:10,948
BILL: <i>Light him down.</i>

1184
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:16,078
It's a pity he should fall and break his neck
without anyone seeing it.

1185
01:36:17,663 --> 01:36:19,498
Show him a light.

1186
01:36:28,925 --> 01:36:32,011
What is it, Nancy, dear, the reason for all this?

1187
01:36:32,053 --> 01:36:33,513
What do you mean?

1188
01:36:33,554 --> 01:36:35,223
That matter just now.

1189
01:36:35,265 --> 01:36:36,933
We'll speak of this anon.

1190
01:36:36,975 --> 01:36:39,269
You have a friend in me, Nance.

1191
01:36:39,310 --> 01:36:41,938
A staunch friend. You know me of old, Nance.

1192
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:43,648
I know you well.

1193
01:36:43,690 --> 01:36:45,275
Good night.

1194
01:36:50,781 --> 01:36:51,782
Dodge.

1195
01:36:51,823 --> 01:36:53,492
Pull it in.

1196
01:36:53,533 --> 01:36:55,202
(Coughing)

1197
01:37:05,838 --> 01:37:07,506
Trouble.

1198
01:37:11,469 --> 01:37:13,137
Dodger!

1199
01:37:19,602 --> 01:37:21,604
WOMAN: Shall we both take him home?

1200
01:37:27,944 --> 01:37:29,613
Something up?

1201
01:37:32,115 --> 01:37:33,784
I...

1202
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:40,499
I want you to do a piece of work for me
that requires great care and caution.

1203
01:37:41,583 --> 01:37:45,671
What is it? I ain't going near no police office.
That don't suit me, that don't.

1204
01:37:45,713 --> 01:37:49,466
There's not the smallest danger in it,
not the smallest.

1205
01:37:49,508 --> 01:37:51,469
I want someone dodged.

1206
01:37:51,510 --> 01:37:53,179
Who? An old 'un?

1207
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:54,889
- Young 'un.
- Who is she?

1208
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:56,390
- One of us.
- Who?

1209
01:37:56,432 --> 01:37:58,100
- (Fagin mouths)
- Nancy?

1210
01:37:58,142 --> 01:37:59,143
Shh!

1211
01:38:00,645 --> 01:38:02,105
What's she been up to?

1212
01:38:02,146 --> 01:38:06,067
I'm not sure she's been up to anything, my dear.
That's why I want her dodged.

1213
01:38:06,109 --> 01:38:06,859
She...

1214
01:38:09,028 --> 01:38:12,282
She may have wanted to talk to people
she shouldn't want to talk to.

1215
01:38:12,323 --> 01:38:16,077
I want to know where she goes, who she sees,
what she says.

1216
01:38:19,039 --> 01:38:20,707
Nancy?

1217
01:38:20,749 --> 01:38:23,335
I don't know. She's a good 'un is Nancy.

1218
01:38:24,378 --> 01:38:26,046
A pound, my dear.

1219
01:38:26,088 --> 01:38:27,756
One whole pound.

1220
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:33,220
Oh!

1221
01:39:08,674 --> 01:39:10,342
Mr Brownlow?

1222
01:39:12,845 --> 01:39:14,680
Yes.

1223
01:39:17,850 --> 01:39:20,978
I'm afraid to speak to you here.
Come away. Follow me.

1224
01:39:35,368 --> 01:39:37,036
This is far enough.

1225
01:39:37,078 --> 01:39:38,746
Why can't we speak up there?

1226
01:39:38,788 --> 01:39:40,456
I told you, I'm afraid.

1227
01:39:40,498 --> 01:39:42,167
I may be followed.

1228
01:39:47,047 --> 01:39:49,090
I'm here because you told my housekeeper

1229
01:39:49,132 --> 01:39:52,052
that you have information
concerning the boy Oliver Twist.

1230
01:39:52,094 --> 01:39:54,471
- So I have.
- Tell me.

1231
01:39:55,555 --> 01:39:59,852
He's being held by the devil,
and he's handing him over to another what...

1232
01:39:59,893 --> 01:40:02,479
means to...

1233
01:40:02,521 --> 01:40:05,107
I must know more. Is it someone close to you?

1234
01:40:05,149 --> 01:40:06,817
One is.

1235
01:40:06,859 --> 01:40:08,652
One ain't.

1236
01:40:08,694 --> 01:40:11,405
These men, whoever they are,
must be delivered up by you.

1237
01:40:11,447 --> 01:40:12,782
Never.

1238
01:40:12,823 --> 01:40:16,494
Bad a life as he has led, I've led a bad life, too,
and I will not turn upon him.

1239
01:40:17,578 --> 01:40:19,247
The other.

1240
01:40:19,288 --> 01:40:21,374
Fagin.

1241
01:40:21,416 --> 01:40:22,875
He has the boy.

1242
01:40:22,917 --> 01:40:25,336
- Fagin?
- Find Fagin and you find the boy.

1243
01:40:25,378 --> 01:40:27,672
- Where is he?
- Spitalfields.

1244
01:40:27,714 --> 01:40:30,008
That's all I'll say. I've said too much.

1245
01:40:31,259 --> 01:40:33,970
No-one must never know who told you. Promise.

1246
01:40:34,012 --> 01:40:36,348
I promise.

1247
01:40:36,389 --> 01:40:39,184
- Tomorrow I'll put the matter before the police.
- No.

1248
01:40:39,226 --> 01:40:40,894
You must do it tonight.

1249
01:40:40,936 --> 01:40:43,146
Just say Fagin and the traps will know.

1250
01:40:43,188 --> 01:40:44,857
- "The traps"?
- The police.

1251
01:40:45,941 --> 01:40:47,609
What can I do to serve you?

1252
01:40:47,651 --> 01:40:49,320
Nothing.

1253
01:40:49,361 --> 01:40:51,030
<i>You can do nothing.</i>

1254
01:40:51,071 --> 01:40:52,740
<i>I am past all hope indeed.</i>

1255
01:40:52,781 --> 01:40:54,867
MR BROWNLOW: <i>Take this. As a reward.</i>

1256
01:40:54,909 --> 01:40:56,577
NANCY: <i>No.</i>

1257
01:40:56,619 --> 01:40:58,287
<i>I've not done this for money.</i>

1258
01:40:58,329 --> 01:40:59,997
<i>God bless you.</i>

1259
01:41:00,039 --> 01:41:01,707
<i>Good night.</i>

1260
01:41:01,749 --> 01:41:03,417
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1261
01:41:03,459 --> 01:41:05,169
<i>Never,</i>

1262
01:41:05,211 --> 01:41:06,921
<i>never say who told you.</i>

1263
01:41:17,932 --> 01:41:20,060
FAGIN: <i>Look at him.</i>

1264
01:41:21,144 --> 01:41:22,813
What a shame it is.

1265
01:41:22,854 --> 01:41:26,316
With his face,
he could pick old ladies' pockets in church.

1266
01:41:26,358 --> 01:41:28,777
His face could be a fortune to us.

1267
01:41:30,070 --> 01:41:31,738
Are you changing your mind?

1268
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:33,449
No.

1269
01:41:34,742 --> 01:41:36,410
No, Bill, it has to be done.

1270
01:41:36,452 --> 01:41:39,079
DODGER: <i>Fagin! Fagin!</i>

1271
01:41:44,043 --> 01:41:45,711
What's got into you, Dodger?

1272
01:41:45,753 --> 01:41:47,213
I have to see Fagin alone.

1273
01:41:47,255 --> 01:41:50,341
- No, no, my dear, you can speak in front of Bill.
- No, I can't.

1274
01:41:50,383 --> 01:41:52,552
Yes, you can. Speak, Dodger. Tell us.

1275
01:41:52,593 --> 01:41:54,262
(Whispers) Nancy...

1276
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:55,763
What about Nancy?

1277
01:41:55,805 --> 01:41:58,600
He done a bit of work for me, Bill.
I had him dodge Nancy.

1278
01:41:58,641 --> 01:42:00,310
What do you mean?

1279
01:42:00,351 --> 01:42:02,354
Tell us, Dodger. You followed her?

1280
01:42:02,395 --> 01:42:03,855
Yes.

1281
01:42:03,897 --> 01:42:05,357
To London Bridge.

1282
01:42:05,398 --> 01:42:07,651
And, what? What at London Bridge?

1283
01:42:07,692 --> 01:42:09,736
She met an old 'un. A gentleman.

1284
01:42:09,778 --> 01:42:11,446
And...

1285
01:42:11,488 --> 01:42:13,156
And? Speak, will ya!

1286
01:42:14,908 --> 01:42:16,577
She peached!

1287
01:42:16,618 --> 01:42:18,370
She told him Fagin had Oliver!

1288
01:42:18,412 --> 01:42:21,540
And the old man wants to go to the traps!
Now, tonight!

1289
01:42:22,625 --> 01:42:24,418
(Bill groans)

1290
01:42:28,172 --> 01:42:30,675
- Let me go! Let me out!
- Bill! Bill! A word?

1291
01:42:30,716 --> 01:42:32,593
Don't speak to me! It's not safe!

1292
01:42:32,635 --> 01:42:34,303
Hear me speak a word.

1293
01:42:34,345 --> 01:42:36,013
<i>Bill, you won't be...</i>

1294
01:42:38,307 --> 01:42:40,393
You won't be too violent, Bill?

1295
01:42:53,698 --> 01:42:57,953
Flit, boys, flit! The traps will be at the door
before you can say Spitalfields.

1296
01:42:57,995 --> 01:42:59,663
Flit, flit, flit!

1297
01:43:01,206 --> 01:43:02,207
Flit!

1298
01:43:03,125 --> 01:43:04,126
Flit!

1299
01:43:04,877 --> 01:43:06,545
Flit!

1300
01:43:07,630 --> 01:43:09,298
Flit!

1301
01:43:12,176 --> 01:43:13,302
Flit!

1302
01:43:40,622 --> 01:43:42,290
Come on.

1303
01:44:07,525 --> 01:44:09,193
Oh, it's you.

1304
01:44:13,406 --> 01:44:15,074
Bill?

1305
01:44:15,116 --> 01:44:16,785
What's the matter?

1306
01:44:25,252 --> 01:44:27,337
Bill, why do you look like that at me?

1307
01:44:29,631 --> 01:44:32,217
There's enough light for what I've got to do.

1308
01:44:32,259 --> 01:44:33,927
What... What have I done?

1309
01:44:35,012 --> 01:44:36,680
Speak to me!

1310
01:44:36,722 --> 01:44:38,849
You know.

1311
01:44:38,891 --> 01:44:41,435
You was watched tonight.

1312
01:44:41,477 --> 01:44:43,187
Every word you said was heard.

1313
01:44:46,315 --> 01:44:47,984
I never said your name, Bill.

1314
01:44:48,025 --> 01:44:49,694
Never.

1315
01:44:49,735 --> 01:44:51,404
Never...

1316
01:44:51,445 --> 01:44:53,114
Bill... Bill.

1317
01:44:53,156 --> 01:44:55,450
Bill!

1318
01:44:56,534 --> 01:44:58,036
Oh, God have mercy.

1319
01:45:22,227 --> 01:45:23,896
Nance?

1320
01:45:29,068 --> 01:45:30,736
Nance?

1321
01:45:32,613 --> 01:45:34,949
(Gasps)

1322
01:45:34,991 --> 01:45:36,492
(Caws)

1323
01:45:52,634 --> 01:45:54,302
I haven't done nothing.

1324
01:45:54,344 --> 01:45:56,012
Be off with you.

1325
01:46:20,496 --> 01:46:22,164
Hello, Fagey.

1326
01:46:22,206 --> 01:46:23,875
Hello, lads.

1327
01:46:25,918 --> 01:46:28,212
What's the news, Toby, what's the news?

1328
01:46:28,254 --> 01:46:29,923
I have it here, Fagin.

1329
01:46:29,964 --> 01:46:31,633
It's all in the Chronicle.

1330
01:46:31,674 --> 01:46:33,134
You're in it.

1331
01:46:33,176 --> 01:46:35,428
Bill's in it. Oliver's in it.

1332
01:46:35,470 --> 01:46:39,975
The Chronicle?
Fancy that, you're famous, Fagin.

1333
01:46:40,016 --> 01:46:41,726
Read it.

1334
01:46:41,768 --> 01:46:44,813
"More information
has reached your correspondent

1335
01:46:44,855 --> 01:46:49,109
concerning the foul and bestial murder
that took place in Spitalfields

1336
01:46:49,151 --> 01:46:52,154
and which has shocked and appalled
the citizens of London.

1337
01:46:52,196 --> 01:46:53,864
(Toby laughs)

1338
01:46:53,906 --> 01:46:59,119
It is believed that the victim,
a young woman, now identified as Nancy,

1339
01:46:59,161 --> 01:47:02,248
was brutally beaten to death...

1340
01:47:02,289 --> 01:47:05,084
<i>by one William Sykes,</i>

1341
01:47:05,126 --> 01:47:07,086
a well-known dangerous villain.

1342
01:47:08,129 --> 01:47:09,797
The motive is as yet unclear,

1343
01:47:09,839 --> 01:47:11,924
but your correspondent has learned

1344
01:47:11,966 --> 01:47:15,678
that the murdered woman
had informed on her associate

1345
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:18,681
and on an infamous fence, Fagin,

1346
01:47:19,766 --> 01:47:24,938
<i>who is now wanted for the abduction</i>
<i>of a young boy, Oliver Twist.</i>

1347
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:27,357
(Toby chuckles gleefully)

1348
01:47:27,399 --> 01:47:29,943
Neither Fagin nor Sykes
are presently in custody,

1349
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:34,990
but the police are engaged in searching for 'em
throughout the city and beyond.

1350
01:47:36,074 --> 01:47:43,248
<i>Sykes, according to the police, is usually</i>
<i>accompanied by a fierce white dog.</i>

1351
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:47,253
How about that, eh?

1352
01:47:57,096 --> 01:47:58,973
(Bill whistles)

1353
01:47:59,849 --> 01:48:00,808
<i>Come.</i>

1354
01:48:00,850 --> 01:48:02,518
Come back here.

1355
01:48:05,939 --> 01:48:07,941
We're going back to London.

1356
01:48:09,859 --> 01:48:12,070
I'll have people to speak to.

1357
01:48:12,112 --> 01:48:14,823
I'll force shiners out of Fagin. Get to France.

1358
01:48:14,865 --> 01:48:17,242
Damn me, we'll risk it.

1359
01:48:21,872 --> 01:48:23,540
MAN: <i>Who's he done in?</i>

1360
01:48:27,336 --> 01:48:28,837
He done in a woman?

1361
01:48:53,947 --> 01:48:55,407
(Bill whistles)

1362
01:48:55,448 --> 01:48:57,158
<i>Bull's-eye!</i>

1363
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:59,536
Don't you hear me when I whistle?

1364
01:49:00,620 --> 01:49:02,289
You gone deaf or something?

1365
01:49:04,458 --> 01:49:06,668
Come here. Come on.

1366
01:49:07,753 --> 01:49:10,172
<i>I ain't gonna harm you. Come on.</i>

1367
01:49:10,214 --> 01:49:13,342
Come on, Bull's-eye. Come here.

1368
01:49:14,885 --> 01:49:16,554
Stop it!

1369
01:49:16,595 --> 01:49:20,015
I'm warning you! Let go of it!
I ain't playing with you!

1370
01:49:20,057 --> 01:49:22,727
Let it go, you stinking varmint!

1371
01:49:22,768 --> 01:49:24,437
Bull's-eye!

1372
01:49:24,478 --> 01:49:26,147
(Bull's-eye growls)

1373
01:49:29,108 --> 01:49:30,651
<i>Bull's-eye!</i>

1374
01:49:30,693 --> 01:49:32,195
<i>Bull's-eye.</i>

1375
01:49:32,236 --> 01:49:34,864
Get back here! Get back here!

1376
01:49:34,906 --> 01:49:36,950
(Bill sighs)

1377
01:49:36,991 --> 01:49:38,368
Damn!

1378
01:49:43,582 --> 01:49:45,250
Ah, it's his dog.

1379
01:49:45,292 --> 01:49:46,960
It's his dog!

1380
01:49:52,883 --> 01:49:54,551
Here, boy.

1381
01:49:54,593 --> 01:49:56,678
- Here.
- Don't go near him.

1382
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:06,105
There is a child in danger, Inspector Blathers.

1383
01:50:06,147 --> 01:50:09,775
But you only seem interested in apprehending
this man William Sykes.

1384
01:50:09,817 --> 01:50:12,612
Your concern should be for the safety of the boy.

1385
01:50:12,653 --> 01:50:16,574
Allow me to say, sir,
this is our usual way of doing business.

1386
01:50:17,659 --> 01:50:19,494
<i>My thinking is this.</i>

1387
01:50:19,535 --> 01:50:22,205
If we get Sykes, we get Fagin.

1388
01:50:22,247 --> 01:50:24,374
And if we get Fagin...

1389
01:50:24,416 --> 01:50:27,127
Sir, we've found the dog.

1390
01:50:30,005 --> 01:50:33,216
Are we going to sit here all night
waiting for the traps to find us?

1391
01:50:33,258 --> 01:50:34,718
Shut it.

1392
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:36,428
No, he's right.

1393
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:38,138
We should do another flit.

1394
01:50:40,015 --> 01:50:41,683
(Knocking)

1395
01:50:41,725 --> 01:50:43,394
The traps!

1396
01:50:59,076 --> 01:51:00,286
What?

1397
01:51:00,328 --> 01:51:01,913
It's him.

1398
01:51:01,954 --> 01:51:03,623
DODGER: <i>Don't let him in.</i>

1399
01:51:03,665 --> 01:51:05,750
We must.

1400
01:51:05,792 --> 01:51:07,460
Go on.

1401
01:51:10,630 --> 01:51:12,298
Go on!

1402
01:51:12,340 --> 01:51:14,009
Ah, you...

1403
01:51:18,388 --> 01:51:20,057
Don't leave us in the dark.

1404
01:52:16,991 --> 01:52:18,659
Damn you all.

1405
01:52:19,702 --> 01:52:21,370
<i>Have you nothing to say to me?</i>

1406
01:52:22,663 --> 01:52:25,082
It's not safe for you to stop here, Bill.

1407
01:52:25,124 --> 01:52:28,044
If it's safe for you, it's safe for me.

1408
01:52:32,090 --> 01:52:33,758
Is it...

1409
01:52:34,842 --> 01:52:36,427
The body, is it buried?

1410
01:52:37,845 --> 01:52:39,514
(Barking)

1411
01:52:44,602 --> 01:52:46,271
Dodger, let him in, quick.

1412
01:52:48,482 --> 01:52:50,650
<i>Dodger.</i>

1413
01:52:51,735 --> 01:52:53,570
<i>Do as I say.</i>

1414
01:52:57,449 --> 01:52:59,785
DODGER: <i>Don't come near me, you monster.</i>

1415
01:53:03,080 --> 01:53:05,749
You're my witnesses. I'm not afraid of him.

1416
01:53:06,834 --> 01:53:09,628
<i>And it they come here
after him, I'll give him up.</i>

1417
01:53:09,670 --> 01:53:11,464
I'll tell 'em you're here.

1418
01:53:13,174 --> 01:53:16,260
He may kill me if he likes,
but if I'm here I'll give him up.

1419
01:53:16,302 --> 01:53:18,721
If he was to be boiled alive, so I would!

1420
01:53:18,763 --> 01:53:21,182
- Why, you little...
- Yargh!

1421
01:53:24,352 --> 01:53:27,480
BILL: I'll tear you limb from limb.

1422
01:53:31,776 --> 01:53:34,613
Help! He's here! He's here!
Break down the door!

1423
01:53:34,654 --> 01:53:36,364
Help!

1424
01:53:36,406 --> 01:53:37,866
<i>Come on, please!</i>

1425
01:53:39,576 --> 01:53:41,245
MAN: <i>That's Bill Sykes!</i>

1426
01:53:41,286 --> 01:53:44,581
Damn you all! Do your worst! I'll cheat you yet!

1427
01:53:55,634 --> 01:53:59,347
No! Bill, no! He's our bargaining tool.

1428
01:53:59,388 --> 01:54:01,641
Not yours, Fagin. Mine.

1429
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:05,269
Bill!

1430
01:54:06,354 --> 01:54:08,022
(Crowd gasps)

1431
01:54:17,365 --> 01:54:19,117
Come on.

1432
01:54:20,827 --> 01:54:23,413
- Don't fire.
- Hold your fire, men. Hold your fire.

1433
01:54:23,455 --> 01:54:25,123
I'll let the boy go.

1434
01:54:25,165 --> 01:54:26,833
I'll let him drop.

1435
01:54:26,875 --> 01:54:29,920
Don't try nothing or I'll let him go!

1436
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:51,943
BILL: Grab hold of that! Grab hold of it!

1437
01:55:01,328 --> 01:55:03,413
We must give chase, sir.

1438
01:55:57,302 --> 01:55:59,388
(Shouting)

1439
01:56:02,141 --> 01:56:03,600
Grab it!

1440
01:56:04,643 --> 01:56:06,312
Grab it!

1441
01:56:43,058 --> 01:56:44,726
(Bill groans)

1442
01:57:02,161 --> 01:57:03,996
(Crowd gasps)

1443
01:57:05,581 --> 01:57:07,250
(Bull's-eye barks)

1444
01:57:10,837 --> 01:57:12,964
(Bull's-eye howls)

1445
01:57:25,644 --> 01:57:27,312
MRS BEDWIN: <i>Oliver!</i>

1446
01:57:27,354 --> 01:57:29,022
<i>Oliver.</i>

1447
01:57:32,401 --> 01:57:34,069
<i>Oliver?</i>

1448
01:57:39,491 --> 01:57:40,951
Here he is, sir.

1449
01:57:40,993 --> 01:57:42,870
MR BROWNLOW: <i>Come along, my boy!</i>

1450
01:57:42,912 --> 01:57:45,122
<i>Mr Grimwig has something to say to you.</i>

1451
01:57:47,625 --> 01:57:49,293
Do the honours, Mrs Bedwin.

1452
01:57:49,335 --> 01:57:53,423
Now, then, young man,
I confess I misjudged you.

1453
01:57:54,507 --> 01:57:58,428
Truth to tell, I feared your benefactor
would make me eat my head.

1454
01:57:59,512 --> 01:58:02,474
But he's a good friend and has pardoned me.

1455
01:58:02,515 --> 01:58:04,392
MR BROWNLOW: <i>And one for Oliver.</i>

1456
01:58:04,434 --> 01:58:06,227
OLIVER: <i>- Thank you, sir.</i>
- So...

1457
01:58:06,269 --> 01:58:10,065
- And you too, Mrs Bedwin.
- Oh, I don't know as I should, sir.

1458
01:58:10,107 --> 01:58:14,319
So, I'll take the liberty, if you'll allow me,
to salute you.

1459
01:58:14,361 --> 01:58:16,196
<i>To Sam Waters.</i>

1460
01:58:16,238 --> 01:58:18,031
Oliver Twist.

1461
01:58:18,073 --> 01:58:19,741
Ah, Oliver Twist.

1462
01:58:19,783 --> 01:58:21,577
To Oliver Twist.

1463
01:58:26,081 --> 01:58:28,000
Why, Oliver...

1464
01:58:28,042 --> 01:58:29,710
my child, what's the matter?

1465
01:58:31,212 --> 01:58:33,464
Why are you so sad?

1466
01:58:43,641 --> 01:58:45,310
(Hammering)

1467
01:59:00,117 --> 01:59:03,704
Are you certain, Oliver,
you wish to go through with this?

1468
01:59:03,745 --> 01:59:05,414
Yes, sir.

1469
01:59:05,456 --> 01:59:07,416
Certain.

1470
01:59:13,255 --> 01:59:14,924
MAN: <i>Yes?</i>

1471
02:00:00,179 --> 02:00:02,390
Is the young gentleman to come too, sir?

1472
02:00:03,474 --> 02:00:05,685
It's not a sight for children, sir.

1473
02:00:05,726 --> 02:00:07,937
It is not indeed, my friend.

1474
02:00:07,979 --> 02:00:12,567
But this child has seen this man
in the full career of his success and villainy,

1475
02:00:12,608 --> 02:00:16,946
and it is his wish, even at the cost of
some pain and fear, that he should see him now.

1476
02:00:49,814 --> 02:00:51,482
18.

1477
02:01:06,956 --> 02:01:09,042
Ho, hey!

1478
02:01:13,171 --> 02:01:14,840
FAGIN: <i>Good boy.</i>

1479
02:01:14,881 --> 02:01:16,550
<i>Good boy, Charley.</i>

1480
02:01:16,591 --> 02:01:18,260
<i>Well done.</i>

1481
02:01:18,302 --> 02:01:19,970
(Fagin mumbles)

1482
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:28,562
Good boy, Charley, well done. Well done.

1483
02:01:28,604 --> 02:01:31,106
Take, take, take the boy away to bed.

1484
02:01:31,148 --> 02:01:33,484
Don't be frightened. Fagin.

1485
02:01:34,568 --> 02:01:36,320
That's me. An old man, my lord.

1486
02:01:37,405 --> 02:01:39,323
A very old, old man.

1487
02:01:39,365 --> 02:01:41,367
There's someone here who wants to see you.

1488
02:01:41,409 --> 02:01:43,161
Strike! Strike them all dead!

1489
02:01:43,202 --> 02:01:45,622
What right have they to butcher me?

1490
02:01:45,663 --> 02:01:47,874
Speak to him now. Quick, if you please.

1491
02:01:47,916 --> 02:01:50,043
For he grows worse as the time goes on.

1492
02:01:52,170 --> 02:01:53,630
Fagin.

1493
02:01:53,672 --> 02:01:55,131
You were kind to me.

1494
02:01:55,173 --> 02:01:56,842
Yes, yes.

1495
02:01:56,883 --> 02:01:59,594
I'll be kind again. I'll be kind again.

1496
02:02:00,679 --> 02:02:02,347
I'll be kind again.

1497
02:02:07,603 --> 02:02:09,271
I'm not afraid.

1498
02:02:09,313 --> 02:02:10,981
Oliver!

1499
02:02:14,193 --> 02:02:16,278
(Fagin sobs)

1500
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:17,988
Let me whisper to you.

1501
02:02:21,158 --> 02:02:22,827
You remember the box?

1502
02:02:22,868 --> 02:02:24,537
Oliver?

1503
02:02:24,579 --> 02:02:27,623
With my pretty things for my old age, Oliver?

1504
02:02:27,665 --> 02:02:31,002
It's hid a little way up the chimney
in the top front room.

1505
02:02:31,044 --> 02:02:32,712
It's yours, Oliver.

1506
02:02:32,754 --> 02:02:34,130
Yours.

1507
02:02:34,172 --> 02:02:35,924
- But we must talk.
- Yes, yes.

1508
02:02:35,965 --> 02:02:38,843
But shall we say a prayer together first?

1509
02:02:38,885 --> 02:02:40,553
Do.

1510
02:02:40,595 --> 02:02:42,597
Say only one, upon your knees.

1511
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:44,307
With me.

1512
02:02:44,349 --> 02:02:46,017
And we can talk all morning.

1513
02:02:47,769 --> 02:02:49,688
Outside. Outside.

1514
02:02:49,730 --> 02:02:52,941
You can say I've gone to sleep
and they'll believe you.

1515
02:02:52,983 --> 02:02:56,779
You can get me out
and the pretty things are yours, my dear. Yours!

1516
02:02:56,820 --> 02:02:58,614
Oh, God, forgive this wretched man.

1517
02:02:58,656 --> 02:03:00,324
That's right.

1518
02:03:00,366 --> 02:03:02,660
That's right. That will help us on.

1519
02:03:02,701 --> 02:03:04,370
If... If... If...

1520
02:03:05,454 --> 02:03:11,043
If I shake and tremble as we
pass the gallows, don't... don't...

1521
02:03:12,086 --> 02:03:13,755
...don't you mind, hurry on.

1522
02:03:13,796 --> 02:03:15,465
Now, now, now.

1523
02:03:15,506 --> 02:03:17,383
WARDER: <i>Have you more to say to him, sir?</i>

1524
02:03:17,425 --> 02:03:19,844
- Nothing more.
- You'd better leave him.

1525
02:03:19,886 --> 02:03:21,554
Press on, press on. Press on.

1526
02:03:21,596 --> 02:03:23,264
Press on, press on.

1527
02:03:24,599 --> 02:03:26,559
Softly, softly. No, no, slow.

1528
02:03:26,601 --> 02:03:28,270
Faster.

1529
02:03:28,311 --> 02:03:29,980
Faster, faster!

1530
02:03:30,021 --> 02:03:32,482
Faster! Faster!

1531
02:03:32,524 --> 02:03:34,192
<i>Faster, faster!</i>

1532
02:03:34,234 --> 02:03:36,612
<i>Faster!</i>

1533
02:03:36,653 --> 02:03:38,322
(Fagin howls)
