168
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,153
WHlSPERlNG] Yeah. That's Jerry.
RYDER: Yeah, that's right.

169
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,989
You check me,
do you understand that?

170
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,866
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
I check, I understand.

171
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,829
Didn't l tell you
to knock first?

172
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:18,000
RYDER [OVER SPEAKER]:
Good, because this is what
we call a cash transaction.

173
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,586
Now, you understand
commodities, don't you?

174
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,714
You know, pork bellies?
Gold? Light crude?

175
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,133
Listen.
Listen, no disrespect,

176
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,343
but maybe--
Maybe I'm not the guy
you should be talking to.

177
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,721
Oh, no,
you are exactly the guy
I wanna talk to.

178
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,599
Now, I want you
to look at the ticker
and you tell me

179
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,185
what is the going rate
for a New York City hostage
today?

180
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,065
You think a milIion dollars
is too much? I do.
I think it's corny.

181
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,610
Now get your calculator out.
You got one?

182
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,820
Uh...

183
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:50,907
RYDRT: Do you haνe a calculator?
Yeah, we got one. I got one.

184
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:56,705
Okay, good. Add this up.
You got $526,31 5 and 79 cents.

185
00:15:56,873 --> 00:16:01,084
That's 526,31 5.79.

186
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,545
Now, times that by 1 9.

187
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:04,880
What do you got?

188
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,341
What is he,
a goddamn accountant?

189
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,471
That's 1 0 million?
What do you got?

190
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,890
That comes out to 1 0 million
plus one cent.

191
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,808
Oh. That is a deal.

192
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,269
You call the mayor
and you tell him the price.

193
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:23,398
And then you tell him
l want it in 1 00,000 $1 00 bills,
you got that?

194
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,400
I got it.
What about the one cent?

195
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,277
Oh, you keep that one cent,
that's your broker fee.

196
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,405
Now, I want the rest
in plain suitcases

197
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,700
the kind with the wheels
and the portable handle,
okay?

198
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,953
Now, this is not
a futures contract.
This is a spot trade.

199
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,165
That means there's a time limit on it.
Okay, you got that?

200
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,584
Now, what do you think
is a fair time limit?

201
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,464
You know, I don't know.
I'm really just a guy--

202
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,924
Come on,
give me a time limit.

203
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,592
Give me a
fair time limit.

204
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,513
Thursday.

205
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,307
I was thinking more like an hour.
Now, what's your watch say?

206
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,602
Two-thirteen.

207
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,521
Oh,
that's exactly what
my watch says.

208
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,857
So at 3:1 3,
I want that money here,
motherfucker.

209
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:09,403
And after that, there is a late fee.

210
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,988
What do you think
that late fee is gonna be?

211
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,119
Come on, tell me what it'll be.

212
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,664
You're gonna kill
the passengers?

213
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,791
Oh, commodities
is what I start to kill.

214
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,794
One for every minute
past the deadline
I am forced to wait.

215
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,671
Now, they become more valuable
this way

216
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,381
and still at the same price.

217
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,300
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
He's underground in the tunnel.
He's never gonna pull this off.

218
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,095
Don't tell me, tell him.
Who the hell is this guy?

219
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,304
I don't know who it is!

220
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,723
MORAN:
Garber, Garber,
just stay with it.

221
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,474
RYDER:
Now, what's your name?
I didn't get your name.

222
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,476
What's your name, my man?
My name?

223
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,687
What's your name?

224
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,189
Tell him?

225
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,984
Garber.
Garber, okay.

226
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,819
Now, seriously, man,
in 59 minutes,

227
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,779
I'm gonna start
killing passengers.

228
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:56,241
So my advice to you
is to get on the phone,
get the mayor notified now.

229
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,118
Listen, l mean...

230
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:01,329
I'm just a civil-service employee.
I can't get ahold of the mayor.

231
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,914
Well, that's your problem,
man, that's not mine.

232
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,460
It's like, who's responsible
for who lives and who dies
in New York?

233
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,086
That's New York City's problem.

234
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:12,257
Get the fuck off the radio
and notify the mayor,
motherfucker!

235
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,011
Okay.

236
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,063
Nine months of this,
and l'm free.

237
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,732
Next mayor gets inaugurated,

238
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,568
I'm gonna be sitting
in Saint-Tropez on the
beach with a piña colada.

239
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,112
I will never have to ride
the subway ever again.

240
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,282
Never say never, sir.
Never.

241
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,618
All right,
what's next for
the afternoon?

242
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,369
East Harlem Elementary
at 2:30.

243
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,039
You're supposed to read
The Cat ln The Hat
to the third grade.

244
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:47,542
Every time I go to
the schools, l get sick.
They all have runny noses.

245
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,379
Call Dr. Katz, tell him
I want him waiting at the
school, with a fu shot.

246
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,229
Mayor's office.

247
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,069
He's in Car 3.
MAN: Yeah.

248
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:16,947
What happened?

249
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,324
Somebody just hijacked
a 6 train.

250
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,910
It's stopped in the tunnel
between 51 st and 42nd.

251
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,788
Another idiot with a gun.
What do we know?

252
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,582
It's unclear, but l have a car
waiting for us downstairs.

253
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,334
Subway will get us there faster.

254
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,378
All right. Let the doors close.

255
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:34,089
Tell them we'll meet them
at 59th Street.

256
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,263
Tell the conductor
this is now an express.

257
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,598
We're skipping the next five stops.
What?

258
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:46,184
MAN: l gotta get to work.
Hold on, hold on.

259
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,437
Everybody will get
where they need to go,
we'll make all the stops.

260
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,107
Maybe he's not such
a douche bag after all,
huh?

261
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,609
Funny.

262
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,282
Figures you'd be the one
to get a call like this.

263
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,952
Hostage negotiation team
is here in five minutes, and
the mayor's been notified.

264
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,288
You gonna tell him?
Get the fuck out of here.

265
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,623
My shift's over in 1 0 minutes.

266
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,542
What are you staring at?
Your face.

267
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,878
I'm trying to remember
for when it's not here
anymore.

268
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,129
You gonna start in
on me now?

269
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:15,964
Damn right,
I'm gonna start in on you.

270
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,216
Don't fuck this up, Garber.
You wanna do it?

271
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,968
It's your station, it's your call.

272
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,470
Oh, it's my call now?
JOHNSON: That's right. Your call.

273
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,014
Come on.

274
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:33,148
GARBER [OVER RADlO]:
Pelham 1 23, come in, this is
Rail Control Center. Are you there?

275
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,192
Gerber Baby boy.
What's up?

276
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:40,739
Garber.
Just wanted to let you know
the mayor's been notified.

277
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,365
Are they gonna pay?

278
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,328
I don't know. l'm just the,
uh, what'd you call me?
The, uh, broker.

279
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,414
No, no. No, you represent
the city of New York right now,
buddy.

280
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:53,168
Well, l can tell you you're dealing
with one of the all-time
bureaucracies, I know that.

281
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:56,379
I mean, it takes time.
You'd better fix the bureaucracy,

282
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:59,341
because when the time comes,
these motherfuckers,
these hostages

283
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,010
are gonna go real quick.

284
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,264
You got it, you got it.
Any other demands?

285
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,391
Yeah, well,
no fucking pizza for them,
either, man.

286
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,394
No, I mean, are you guys, like,
you know, are you terrorists?

287
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,606
Do I sound like a terrorist?
Do I terrorize you?

288
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:18,068
Actually, you don't, but I mean,
not that I ever talked to one.

289
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,277
So--

290
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,113
So, what,
this is just about money?

291
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,907
Oh, is there anything else?

292
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,367
There's not dying.

293
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,912
Yeah, well, you know, you live,
you die. You either go with
the current or you fight it,

294
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,747
you all end up
in the same place.

295
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,123
Where's that, Jersey?

296
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,250
Yeah, you watch it.
I was born there, man.

297
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,753
I'm just saying,
you're up in the
motorman's cab.

298
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:40,382
That means you're on the radio,
which means that you're an
easy target.

299
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,509
You gotta know the drill.

300
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,428
I know that soon
I won't be alone,

301
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:49,265
and if I'm the first to get shot,
I'm the first of many to get shot.

302
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,559
That's correct,
but then you'd still be dead.

303
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:55,605
Dead is an improvement
on a lot of things
I can think of, buddy boy.

304
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,273
Sounds like he slept
with my ex.

305
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,152
You know,
we all owe God a death.

306
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,113
And l'm a man
who pays his debts.

307
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,115
Are you a man who pays his debts?

308
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,660
Yeah, yeah, sure.
TV, cable, and my mortgage.

309
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,078
That's a little like dying
once a month.

310
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,956
Oh, you're married,
you're a married man.

311
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,332
Maybe.

312
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,837
No, no, no. You're married, man.
Married men have mortgages.

313
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,131
What about you?
You got a mortgage?

314
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,092
Well, l don't know, Garber.
Why don't you tell me,
then we'll both know?

315
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:29,264
I don't know. l mean, you...
I'm sure someone out there
loves you dearly and, uh,

316
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:31,266
you know,
would be worried about you.

317
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:33,268
Like I said,
you're in the motorman's cab,

318
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:35,687
you got no cover,
sniper on the way.

319
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,314
Well, you know,
circumstances are
my protection

320
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,651
because right now, you know,
hostages are good insurance.

321
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:44,362
By the way I see it,
I'm pretty well-protected.

322
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:50,076
You know, this reminds me
of being in a confessional.

323
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,037
GARBER:
Are you Catholic?

324
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,955
I'm married, you're Catholic.

325
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,166
Maybe. I don't know.

They demoted me,
pending the outcome.

632

And now they're trying
to humiliate you,
is that right?

we pretend the deadline
doesn't exist,

815
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,994
we talk through it,
we buy time, we
get a little movement.

That's right.

How does he know l'm here?

Does he have a camera in here?
Can he hear me?

Uh, we can, we can, we can--
We can all hear you here. Yes.

Okay, good. So tell him--
Tell him I wanna
make him a deal.

835

Tell him I'lI make him a deal
right now.

00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,581
Okay, all right.

00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,333
Well, come on, speak up,
Mr. Mayor.

838
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:05,293
You're talking to
your constituents.

We got a train full
of registered voters.
Don't you care?

Don't you care about your voters?

Your Honor, don't talk.
Don't engage with him.

the blue button there,

Heh, heh, hey.
Good to meet you, man.

of New York, is that true?

850
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:39,536
Yes, but at least
it's honest work.

851
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:43,289
After taxes that's, like,
87 cents, isn't it?

852

Uh, yes.

Don't bullshit me, man.

00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:50,338
It would take, like, 3000 years
to pay off that suit that
you're wearing.

What do you got, 20, 30 million
dollars or something like that?

You don't get that

something about that, huh?

861
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:13,653
and l will trade you
for all these passengers
in the train, how's that?

862
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:21,578
Okay, you could save the lives
of 1 7 New Yorkers.

863
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:23,663

What's the deal?

00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:57,530
It's a very nice offer,
but I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to decline.

872
00:51:57,698 --> 00:52:00,742
Oh, good.
Because if you begged me,
I wouldn't give you that deal, man.

He didn't call in, nothing.

He knows the system.

That if l get caught,
