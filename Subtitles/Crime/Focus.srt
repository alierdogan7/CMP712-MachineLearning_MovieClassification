<i>Restaurante El Leño ,

7
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:06,201
Yes, I would like a
reservation for tonight.

00:01:06,202 --> 00:01:08,102
<i>Sorry, you must be in advance
</i>

9
00:01:08,103 --> 00:01:09,903
Okay, I understand,

<i>Restaurante El Leno,

00:01:23,205 --> 00:01:24,905
<i>OK</i>

12
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:07,706
Look, my boyfriend is there.

13
00:02:11,806 --> 00:02:14,906
Could you be my boyfriend,
just for a minute?

14
00:02:15,607 --> 00:02:18,907
're Not a serial murderer
, right?

15
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:22,508
Depends. How many are
to kill to be serial?

16
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,909
- Five?
- No, then no.

17
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,210
- Jess.
- Nicky.

18
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:36,211
- Burgundy.
- Very Good.

19
00:02:38,212 --> 00:02:42,212
It is very confusing, no?
How do you know what?

20
00:02:42,313 --> 00:02:44,513
Mainly
by drinking.

21
00:02:45,214 --> 00:02:47,214
Yes
The more you drink, the more you learn..

22
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:52,315
In that case I'm almost
expert Jagermeister bottles.

23
00:02:53,316 --> 00:02:55,316
I can tell you all about it.

24
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:58,217
It's been a pleasure serving you, Chef O'Chivalry

25
00:03:01,218 --> 00:03:05,318
- Chef who?
- O'Chivalry.

26
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,319
Yes

27
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:12,519
Yes, perhaps I am somewhat
drink but this is fun.

28
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,520
Thanks.
Thanks for rescuing me.

29
00:03:19,221 --> 00:03:23,121
- Yes, we teach. .
- Yes

30
00:03:23,122 --> 00:03:26,282
You have to respect him because he left everything on the field.

31
00:03:26,283 --> 00:03:28,123
- All that I missed tonight?
- Yes

32
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,124
Go..

33
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,925
- I take you somewhere?
- In fact, I'm staying here.

34
00:03:34,526 --> 00:03:36,726
Top.

35
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:39,287
Really?

36
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,288
- My God, is my husband!
- Shut up!

37
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:00,789
Dereck, wait!

38
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,980
- I'll kill you!
- Dereck, let it go.

39
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:04,791
In no fucking way. He's dead.

40
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:07,282
Give me a fucking reason why I should not?

41
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:11,683
- I shoot.
- What?

42
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,584
I think we should shoot.

43
00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:15,385
To be honest, yes
we offended you.

44
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:17,286
Do not play with him, Nicky.
Was already in jail.

45
00:04:17,287 --> 00:04:18,887
In the damn jail.

46
00:04:18,888 --> 00:04:21,488
Do you have any idea what
was about to do to her?

47
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:22,489
Shut up, asshole.

48
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,490
Never
going to want to be with you after that.

49
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:27,391
- You should really shoot.
- What the fuck?

50
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,002
What kind of things
we talking about?

51
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:31,093
A bacchanal Arab party.

52
00:04:31,094 --> 00:04:32,894
A bacchanal Arab party?

53
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,695
A wave as parties in clubs R. Kelly

54
00:04:35,696 --> 00:04:37,396
Please
Come on, shoot me.

55
00:04:37,397 --> 00:04:39,287
Stop fuck!
'll Kill you, damn.

56
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:41,588
Really
you be doing me a favor. I have cancer.

57
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:45,989
A tumor the size of a peach
. Shoot, you'll see.

58
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,190
- Do you have cancer?
- It is not cheating.

59
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:51,291
Shit!
I knew this would not work.

60
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:53,892
- You are very bad.
- Just give us the money.

61
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,093
- Or what?
- O he will shoot you in the neck.

62
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:58,994
Shoot a guy with cancer?
The McCloskey grandmother had cancer.

63
00:04:58,995 --> 00:05:01,785
- He does not have cancer, you idiot!
- Really ruined it all.

64
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:04,286
First, you should wait
she take off my pants.

65
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:06,587
And then you, you had to give me a chance to escape
.

66
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:08,388
Here's how you would get the money.

67
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:10,389
And never the character is lost, you never bankruptcies.

68
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,990
Dies with lies.

69
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:13,991
When will we discover?

70
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:16,392
When you stole the wallet
Fool below.

71
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:19,993
- Can not be.
- Now it can be.

72
00:05:19,994 --> 00:05:22,394
Why
uploaded here if you're so smart?

73
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:24,995
Professional curiosity.

74
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:27,996
And I like breasts.
I thought that was kind of win-win.

75
00:05:27,997 --> 00:05:30,697
Goodbye, sweetheart.
It was a failed act.

76
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:32,298
Was a great lift.

77
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,799
Please
he was so drunk you could steal the appendix.

78
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Bad Son.

79
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,700
You should be more alert, I
I followed for two blocks.

80
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:45,601
Can not you see me?

81
00:05:45,602 --> 00:05:47,402
I do not have eyes in the back part
my head.

82
00:05:47,403 --> 00:05:50,503
If you play this game, you better have
a.

83
00:05:51,504 --> 00:05:53,504
Can take care of myself.

84
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:55,985
If so,
sure you'll hurt yourself.

85
00:05:57,286 --> 00:05:59,986
- I'll buy you a coffee.
- Do not drink coffee.

86
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:04,287
- Okay.
- All Right.

87
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:10,288
So what do you do?
Hook? Steal?

88
00:06:11,109 --> 00:06:12,889
- Tell me.
- Everything.

89
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,590
I've been in this long ago.

90
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:16,191
Being pickpocket,
That's what I do.

91
00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:17,992
- Really?
- Yes

92
00:06:17,993 --> 00:06:18,993
Okay..

93
00:06:20,194 --> 00:06:24,594
My grandfather used to be
scammer in Harlem.

94
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:27,595
Then my father started
enganchador work for him.

95
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:33,486
One day I discovered. A mafioso
saw him making signs.

96
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:38,597
All drew their weapons,
surrendered, no way out.

97
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,598
Except one: The Panic Button
Toledo.

98
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:43,989
What the hell is that?

99
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,490
Shoot your partner and
prove they are not together.

100
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:48,591
Kill your partner?

101
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:51,592
Well, do not expect
.

102
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:53,493
Did it work?

103
00:06:54,204 --> 00:06:56,294
Had already killed three.

104
00:06:57,205 --> 00:07:00,695
So your father killed your grandfather?

105
00:07:01,206 --> 00:07:04,696
This is the world you are.
Fans are killed.

106
00:07:04,997 --> 00:07:09,197
Look, I came into the world in this
like you. It was a dyslexic girl

107
00:07:09,198 --> 00:07:13,898
orphan, with no plans or future.
It is a miracle that I no longer prostitute.

108
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:15,199
- Teach me.
- No.

109
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,900
- Why not?
- No time.

110
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:20,201
Wait, look.
I can pay you if that helps.

111
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:24,282
- Who is this portfolio?
- From Dr. Peter Washilaw.

112
00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:31,183
Let's make this quick because
very cold and I want to show you

113
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,584
few movements.
But at the end of the day...

114
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:36,585
This is a game of focus.

115
00:07:40,186 --> 00:07:41,386
Very clever.

116
00:07:41,387 --> 00:07:44,587
Well, attention is
as a reflector.

117
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:48,588
And our job is to dance in the dark.

118
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:52,289
Not felt when you took from me.

119
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:55,590
The human brain is slow and not multitasking.

120
00:07:56,201 --> 00:07:58,591
God... when?

121
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:01,792
Well, sure
can steal a wallet, but...

122
00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:03,893
What we talked about is
more complex than that.

123
00:08:03,894 --> 00:08:05,694
When you brought me your wallet?

124
00:08:06,295 --> 00:08:08,295
Tomas Zumba?

125
00:08:08,496 --> 00:08:10,796
In fact
is an excellent cardiovascular exercise.

126
00:08:10,797 --> 00:08:13,197
- Thank you.
- Are you thinking with your hands.

127
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:15,198
Please log in
head of your victim.

128
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,199
Perceive from their perspective.

129
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Human behavior is very predictable.

130
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:23,201
If you look at my hand naturally
I force myself to look away.

131
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,202
And let me into your space.

132
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:28,503
But when I look ahead,
cause you to look me directly.

133
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:34,904
Very cute.

134
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:36,505
If I touch here
stole here.

135
00:08:36,706 --> 00:08:39,206
If I touch you here, you
stole this side.

136
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:43,207
If I get here, you will not
me a slap, right?

137
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:44,208
Why?

138
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:46,209
What would you do if you knew where my hand was.

139
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,510
Okay,
understand. I get it.

140
00:08:56,511 --> 00:09:00,981
When you have their attention,
can take whatever you want.

141
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:07,982
Gotta be safe.

142
00:09:21,203 --> 00:09:26,183
<i># The joy, the joy is giving
</i>

143
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:32,284
<i># The give all</i>

144
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:41,105
<i># Please </! i>

145
00:09:41,306 --> 00:09:43,106
Why I like this place?

146
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:47,107
In space, no open
here to two months...

147
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:50,308
There is access to multiple lines,
impossible for us to track.

148
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:54,109
Change the IP addresses
military also has optical fiber.

149
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,510
How many bathrooms? The fat
Farhad plans to come.

150
00:09:57,511 --> 00:09:59,911
Two shared. Still
with IBS?

151
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:01,512
Yes.

152
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:03,103
Heaven, should be
colon lavage.

153
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:08,284
Horst, is a Persian 400 pounds.
Will not do a colon cleansing.

154
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:10,285
Where will you stay?
Does the Hyatt again?

155
00:10:10,286 --> 00:10:13,286
Yes, I love lunch.
Should you go?

156
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:16,287
No, no lunch.
I do a colon cleanse.

157
00:10:16,388 --> 00:10:18,288
<i>Horses doors</i>

158
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:49,289
There Hyatt card in my wallet.

159
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,990
Admits're impressed.

160
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:53,291
You stole his wallet and found you
all the way to here.

161
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:56,692
Please, World Series?
Does the NBA Finals?

162
00:10:56,693 --> 00:10:58,493
Sugar Bowl, Super Bowl
The.

163
00:10:58,494 --> 00:11:00,994
Any big event and is near the center.

164
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:03,295
Equal  I found, that
has to be worth something.

165
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:05,396
How many Hyatts have to go?

166
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:08,587
Three.
Five times each.

167
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,988
I want to enter.

168
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:12,789
Maybe I'm just here to watch the game.

169
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,990
I was wondering who ran the business in Harlem.

170
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:19,591
Liam House Kid was your grandfather.
Bucky Spurgeon's your father.

171
00:11:19,592 --> 00:11:21,292
Father is a very generous term.

172
00:11:21,293 --> 00:11:23,383
And you're Nicky Spurgeon,
call you "mellow."

173
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:25,184
I do not need people, honey.

174
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,885
Come on, please.
Can we just...?

175
00:11:28,806 --> 00:11:32,886
Can we skip the part where

Hey, hey, that

Who was the police who fingered?

359
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:46,899
He was real.
It just appeared there.

360
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,900
Who makes him that a widow?

361
00:23:48,901 --> 00:23:52,201
I think it's fantastic
you look in that dress.

362
00:23:53,202 --> 00:23:55,102
What can make the girl?

363
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:57,503
I think
some things you can do.

364
00:23:58,204 --> 00:23:59,984
Yes, indeed
myself.

365
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,895
I think we should start with the oral part
. I'm just saying.

366
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:05,896
- Come on, man, I'm here.
- Okay.

367
00:24:07,507 --> 00:24:11,097
Everyone.
Whole world, everyone.

368
00:24:11,098 --> 00:24:13,298
Everyone
pay attention.

369
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:16,199
What are you laughing?

370
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,400
Broke the record.

<i>Well</i>

Great job.
Great job.

376
00:24:30,986 --> 00:24:33,586
After the game tomorrow,
this place will be dismantled.

377
00:24:33,587 --> 00:24:36,987
Anything not bolted to the floor
go straight to the incinerator.

378
00:24:36,988 --> 00:24:40,588
Horst give them for their tickets.
When they are home

Is everything?
Are the 1.2 million?

00:25:27,616 --> 00:25:30,116
Do not go to waste. Promise?

387
00:25:30,117 --> 00:25:33,117
- Yes, I promise.
- No dogs or horses.

388
00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:35,118
Hey, how long
you know me?

389
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,719
No, just look at me, man to man

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,420
Yes, dear.

- All Right. Are we going to the game tomorrow?

394
00:25:58,204 --> 00:26:00,644
- Do you have tickets?
- Of course.

395
00:26:01,245 --> 00:26:03,245
One of the benefits of the business.

396
00:26:04,246 --> 00:26:06,746
You mean to...
these tickets?

397
00:26:06,747 --> 00:26:11,747
Okay. You'll have to stop
to do that. Stop bragging.

398
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:16,948
- A final interview?
- Yes.

399
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:19,749
- My God, are you serious?
- Tell Me.

400
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,550
Want to read: Jess is a great
hardworking, honest and dutiful.

401
00:26:23,551 --> 00:26:25,851
I think it will be very useful

402
00:26:25,852 --> 00:26:28,252
restaurant in San Bernardino.

403
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,653
No, not a reference
idiot.

404
00:26:31,254 --> 00:26:33,854
A critical. A
constructive criticism.

405
00:26:35,205 --> 00:26:36,855
Really?

406
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:42,856
- Are you serious? .
- Yes

407
00:26:45,207 --> 00:26:46,957
Okay.

408
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,958
Good.

409
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:54,559
Have a special touch
.

410
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,560
You almost invisible outside.

411
00:27:00,231 --> 00:27:05,161
And calm you, if things go wrong
not get into panic.

412
00:27:05,162 --> 00:27:08,262
'll Adjust. In fact... you concentrate

413
00:27:09,203 --> 00:27:12,983
When things get complicated. Which is weird.

414
00:27:13,204 --> 00:27:18,984
And I've been at this for...
long, long time.

415
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:23,585
And I've never seen anything like you
.

416
00:27:27,206 --> 00:27:28,986
Thanks.

417
00:27:31,207 --> 00:27:33,987
But actually was talking about sex.

418
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:36,388
Please
no better than you thousands.

419
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:39,389
Oh, please!
How could you say that?

420
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,790
As you lie there. I say:
"Come on, is that all?"

421
00:27:44,591 --> 00:27:45,891
're Bad.

422
00:27:49,202 --> 00:27:51,982
- Why "mellow"?
- What?

423
00:27:52,283 --> 00:27:54,183
Why do you call
mellow?

424
00:27:55,204 --> 00:27:58,984
I know, yes.
I do not like that name.

425
00:27:59,205 --> 00:28:01,985
I know, but do you call
well.

426
00:28:03,786 --> 00:28:06,186
My dad started calling me that.

427
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,787
What?

428
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,988
And I did not like.

429
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:24,189
My father said that...

430
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,690
There are two types of people in this world:

431
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:33,391
hammers and nails.

432
00:28:34,302 --> 00:28:36,392
You decide which of them want to be.

433
00:28:37,203 --> 00:28:39,983
Said that
no place for the weak in this game.

434
00:28:41,204 --> 00:28:43,284
If you do not want to kill you.

435
00:28:46,065 --> 00:28:51,285
Said I was soft so
started calling Mashmelo.

436
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:54,186
Mellow...

437
00:28:58,207 --> 00:29:00,987
You're a great mellow, did you know?

438
00:29:05,488 --> 00:29:08,188
I'll bring more wine,
Do you want some?

439
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:11,639
- No. I'm fine.
- OK.

440
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,640
My God.

441
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:46,441
<i># Baby, please do not leave
</i>

442
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,142
<i># Baby, please do not leave
</i>

443
00:29:49,743 --> 00:29:51,843
<i># Nena , please do not go
to New Orleans</i>

444
00:29:51,844 --> 00:29:53,544

447
00:30:00,287 --> 00:30:02,547
<i># Well, you have been the reason
</i>.

448
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:05,848
<i># Well, have you been the reason. You left the farm
County...</i>

449
00:30:06,209 --> 00:30:08,149
How did you get these tickets?

450
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,980
Is one of the many wonders of being
.

451
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:26,981
Is it a bad time to tell
I do not like football?

452
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:32,682
Yes
worst possible moment.

453
00:30:33,303 --> 00:30:34,983
Sorry.

454
00:30:34,984 --> 00:30:38,284
Is that there are people on the court
doing nothing all the time.

455
00:30:38,285 --> 00:30:40,185
- Are you kidding?
- Do not you think?

456
00:30:40,186 --> 00:30:43,186
Well, you were very excited
tickets.

457
00:30:43,187 --> 00:30:47,987
I am. I am very excited,
just do not understand the game.

458
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:53,388
You know what? Forget football,
we can still have fun.

459
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:04,289
Good. I bet you a dollar that
that does not catch the hot dog.

460
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,690
- That one?
- Yes

461
00:31:05,691 --> 00:31:06,991
Okay..

462
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:13,812
- How do you know that?
- Because that guy can not throw.

463
00:31:13,813 --> 00:31:16,413
Shot glasses of elderly
10 minutes ago.

464
00:31:16,414 --> 00:31:17,614
Well, well.

465
00:31:22,204 --> 00:31:27,214
Down there. The 69
is too drunk to do the wave.

466
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:29,215
You sure?
Does your team is winning?

467
00:31:29,216 --> 00:31:30,916
- Do you bet or not?
- Yeah I bet.

468
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:32,117
Okay.

469
00:31:33,518 --> 00:31:35,118
Do not.

470
00:31:39,209 --> 00:31:41,889
- Yes!
- Really? Really?

471
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:44,190
- I know my drunk.
- Are you a fan?

472
00:31:44,191 --> 00:31:46,191
Do you consider yourself a fan
same?

473
00:31:46,192 --> 00:31:47,642
Thanks.

474
00:31:48,203 --> 00:31:51,143
- The game is called.
- No, it's playoff time.

475
00:31:51,144 --> 00:31:52,544
Okay.

476
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:55,605
Good. "Mamita"
with short shorts.

477
00:31:55,606 --> 00:31:56,906
Yes

478
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:00,987
How many men will look at the
back while climbing stairs?

479
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:03,108
- Win that comes close.
- Only the shore?

480
00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:05,289
- Only the shore.
- Eight. There are eight.

481
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,200
Eight?
I say three.

482
00:32:08,401 --> 00:32:09,901
Five.

483
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:16,376
- Can I participate in this?
- Sure, $ 10, sir...

484
00:32:16,386 --> 00:32:18,975
Liyuan.
I bet they look at five o'clock.

485
00:32:18,976 --> 00:32:19,976
Okay.

486
00:32:21,616 --> 00:32:23,789
There's one.
Two...

487
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:27,738
Three, four.
I'm sorry.

488
00:32:27,938 --> 00:32:30,756
Five.
And there are six!

489
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:33,443
Six!

490
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,847
Seven, yes!
I am the closest he came.

491
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:42,425
I know mine too.
Pay, pay, pay.

492
00:32:42,435 --> 00:32:45,436
- Well, well.
- I want justice.

493
00:32:45,437 --> 00:32:47,737
I want my money back.
Let another bet.

494
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:48,867
Okay.

495
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,659
I want my change.

496
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,551
Which team will next need?

497
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:56,414
I do not know football.
Bet men.

498
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,708
- Well, defense.

499
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,373
Thousand dollars.

- Well, you say.
- Corrida.

509
00:33:42,044 --> 00:33:43,298
Run.

Yes! They ran, ran

511
00:33:54,823 --> 00:33:59,580

- No, no. Double or nothing, you bet.
- No, I'm fine. Thank You.

514
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:11,201
No, an easy bet, easy.
If they kick you win. Good.

515
00:34:11,401 --> 00:34:14,672
They put field goal
you can not lose. Come on, I want to play!

516
00:34:15,733 --> 00:34:19,304
I like you.
You can not lose.

- How much?
- Double or nothing, 10,000.

519
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:36,529
Or is it too much?

520
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,900
Okay, 10000.

521
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,255
- Really?
- God.

522
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,435
Sorry, I'm a lucky guy
.

523
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,670

Not return the kick.
If boots win the bet.

It's just an expression.

How did you do that?

651
00:45:23,399 --> 00:45:27,661
Ze Liyuan a legendary gambler.
Was betting on everything, whatever

652
00:45:27,662 --> 00:45:29,662
using large amounts in cash all the time.

653
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,455
Once at the Bellagio Bill Gates pulled

654
00:45:32,456 --> 00:45:34,871

655
00:45:34,895 --> 00:45:36,579
and he was the perfect victim.

656
00:45:37,236 --> 00:45:39,163
But how did you know who was going to choose?

657
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,133
We alerted.
We told him all day.

658

Damn, go!

669
00:46:22,326 --> 00:46:24,748
The suggestion was everywhere.

670
00:46:24,749 --> 00:46:26,749
The number of flowers in the vases.

671
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:30,564
Even in the back of the
prostitute we sent last night.

672
00:46:32,511 --> 00:46:35,193
- That's great.
- Yes

673
00:46:35,406 --> 00:46:37,709
And there was only what looked
, so I heard..

674
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:40,859
<i>The Mandarin word
five is </i> "wu."

675
00:46:42,006 --> 00:46:46,104
<i>There are 124 "wus"
the song "Sympathy for the Devil."</i>

= = <i>
not recorded but everything was there</i>

677
00:46:50,249 --> 00:46:53,986
<i>So when he took those
binoculars and looked at the field,</i>

678
00:46:53,987 --> 00:46:57,347
<i>sees a familiar face with
number 55 on his jersey...</i>

679
00:46:57,415 --> 00:47:00,860
<i>
A little voice in your mind tells you: That's</i>

680
00:47:01,258 --> 00:47:04,472
. <i> And think is
intuition. And choose</i>

681
00:47:04,982 --> 00:47:06,705
Would you like to write it?

682
00:47:08,361 --> 00:47:11,079
<i>And you, being in the dark ages
who convince</i>

683
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,048
<i>We call that. The small blind mouse

684
00:47:15,435 --> 00:47:18,755
Am I the mouse. blind?
You're stupid.

685
00:47:19,706 --> 00:47:21,738
Could you tell me you had a 100% success.

686
00:47:22,148 --> 00:47:24,926
100% is probabilistic.
Farhad was 59%

687
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,627
but better than Las Vegas.

688
00:47:28,204 --> 00:47:30,236
What if he had chosen
wrong?

689
00:47:31,158 --> 00:47:32,820
She folded the bet until it happened.

690
00:47:33,003 --> 00:47:34,520
That's incredible.

691
00:47:35,117 --> 00:47:38,380
're Amazing. Nicky!

692
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,982

00:47:53,252 --> 00:47:55,879
You did very well.

694
00:47:57,263 --> 00:47:59,568
Okay.

695
00:48:05,423 --> 00:48:07,412
What?
Why do we stop?

696
00:48:10,326 --> 00:48:12,210
Nicky...

697
00:48:14,718 --> 00:48:20,019
- What is this?
- Are 80,000. The paper concluded.

698
00:48:22,563 --> 00:48:24,922
- You did very well.
- You're kidding, right?

699
00:48:27,232 --> 00:48:29,210
You...

700
00:48:30,518 --> 00:48:32,667
- Take her to the airport.
- I will not go there, waiting.

701
00:48:32,668 --> 00:48:34,768
Can you talk to me?
Can you...? ¿Nicky?

702
00:48:34,876 --> 00:48:36,763
- You did good.
- What?

703
00:48:37,773 --> 00:48:40,146
Answer me! Nicky!

704
00:49:35,204 --> 00:49:39,135
<B> THREE YEARS </ b>

705
00:49:39,136 --> 00:49:41,378
<B> BUENOS AIRES </ b>.

706
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,341
Do not expect a similar face.

707
00:50:09,541 --> 00:50:12,589
The technicians say the artifact reviewed

708
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:16,190
but honestly,
I do not like this.

709
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:19,817
And I do not like him.

710
00:50:20,205 --> 00:50:23,872
- Why?
- It's a scammer, sir.

711
00:50:26,267 --> 00:50:30,482
- That's the point.
- I have my Beretta list.

712
00:50:31,819 --> 00:50:33,997
Owens, why do you have to be so dramatic
?

713
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:38,161
Invite him to lunch.

714
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:46,242
're A man known for your
ability to persuade and deceive.

715
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:50,571
It was very difficult to locate.

716
00:50:51,404 --> 00:50:54,213
- Why did you accept my offer?
- I'm bankrupt.

717
00:50:58,624 --> 00:51:01,162
My car.
40 million euros in technology.

718
00:51:01,553 --> 00:51:04,896
McEwen, Rahan, Lotus.
Any team

719
00:51:04,897 --> 00:51:07,497
class it,
has invested half.

720
00:51:08,307 --> 00:51:11,885
- But I need not have.
- An ignition algorithm.

721
00:51:11,886 --> 00:51:14,992
Yes, the EXR.
All they want.

722
00:51:16,037 --> 00:51:20,338
Is legal. And my engineers
I say I will win with him.

723
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:23,489
That's not me enough.

724
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:26,670
This year the team McEwen
is the only thing that gets me.

725
00:51:26,671 --> 00:51:28,671
That's why I need you.

726
00:51:29,956 --> 00:51:34,013
This requires discretion,
be safe, without errors.

727
00:51:48,448 --> 00:51:51,989
I'll go through a disgruntled engineer
appearance.

728
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:55,332
Sell Offering EXR McEwen.

729
00:51:55,861 --> 00:51:58,582
What we give you is a fake,
actually does nothing.

730
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:01,283
Only
will give a false reading their instruments.

731
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:05,897
Enough to fool the pilot
will have a slight increase.

732
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,896
One third of a second
few laps, imperceptible.

733
00:52:08,905 --> 00:52:12,395
Just because
technicians say it works, what makes you think

734
00:52:12,396 --> 00:52:15,896
you can convince them that you are absolutely real?

735
00:52:16,615 --> 00:52:18,435
That you're completely authentic.

736
00:52:18,759 --> 00:52:21,281
You can not be fooling around here, boy.

737
00:52:24,017 --> 00:52:27,365
No need to worry about me.
I am extremely well prepared.

738
00:52:28,132 --> 00:52:32,193
Proceed as planned,
tearing at the party tonight.

739
00:52:32,194 --> 00:52:32,929
Good.

740
00:52:32,994 --> 00:52:38,607

'll Be seen drinking and screaming and discontent.

741
00:52:38,773 --> 00:52:41,163
I will approach him in full view of McEwen.

742
00:52:41,373 --> 00:52:46,014
'll Start to argue, you
throw my drink. I shove...

743
00:52:46,214 --> 00:52:48,508
- If it's okay for you.
- Okay.

744
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:51,748
Would be very surprised that
McEwen has not approached me there,

745
00:52:51,749 --> 00:52:53,949
but if it does I
I will contact him.

746
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:54,750
Good.

747
00:52:54,777 --> 00:52:58,687
Whatever
willing to pay me, I will stay at 100%.

748
00:52:59,202 --> 00:53:01,892
- With a limit of one million you.
- Do we have a deal?

749
00:53:02,366 --> 00:53:05,204
- Yes, Mr. Garriga. No deal.
- That's cool.

750
00:53:06,454 --> 00:53:08,578
- I appreciate your time.
- Thank You.

751
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:09,979
I'll see you tonight.

752
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:17,981
- Do not say I did not warn you.
- Drama.

753
00:53:19,132 --> 00:53:20,810
I'm excited.

754
00:54:01,945 --> 00:54:03,928
I'm here for work.

755
00:54:04,014 --> 00:54:06,743
- Do you speak English?
- Yes, of course.

756
00:54:06,963 --> 00:54:09,353
- Yes, but speaks good Spanish.
- No, no, no.

757
00:54:09,354 --> 00:54:11,354
- Yes, yes...
- Thanks.

758
00:54:11,355 --> 00:54:12,355
Okay.

759
00:54:12,587 --> 00:54:14,440
Look, I'm here this
night on business.

760
00:54:14,441 --> 00:54:16,941
I am a recovering alcoholic.

761
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:20,674
So when you ask for a Vodka Martini
ice...

762
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:23,675
If you can bring me water
olives, that would be fantastic.

763
00:54:24,273 --> 00:54:25,638
Great choice, sir.

764
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:26,939
- Sabia.
- Thank You.

765
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:29,715
The point is that I do not even drink.

766
00:54:29,716 --> 00:54:31,716
That man has me drinking again.

767
00:54:31,717 --> 00:54:32,517
Okay.

768
00:54:32,518 --> 00:54:34,362
- Vodka Martini with ice.
- On the rocks.

769
00:54:34,363 --> 00:54:37,598
I wonder if Garriga in Spanish means thief.

770
00:54:37,976 --> 00:54:39,766
My God, why
drinker!

771
00:54:40,291 --> 00:54:43,269
Who put a sofa
full of women among the party?

772
00:54:44,212 --> 00:54:47,637
Hey, where are people of color is
?

773
00:54:47,837 --> 00:54:50,318
There, there...

774
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:51,819
<i>
This man is a thief</i>

775
00:54:51,965 --> 00:54:55,328
<i>I guess you can do what you want
when you're rich, idiot </. i>

776
00:54:55,329 --> 00:54:57,078
You should drink less.

777
00:54:57,209 --> 00:55:00,922
No, honey.
I have the right to speak, this is a free country.

778
00:55:01,403 --> 00:55:04,710
- Buenos Aires is a free country, right?
- Buenos Aires is a city.

779
00:55:04,711 --> 00:55:05,911
Okay, sorry.

780
00:55:06,278 --> 00:55:08,747
Hey! Hey!

781
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:40,864
- Hello.
- Hi.

782
00:55:42,948 --> 00:55:46,313
- Hello.
- A long time.

783
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:51,613
- So you're here...
- Rafael?

784
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:52,914
- Yes
- Yes.

785
00:55:53,027 --> 00:55:55,293
Is owner of one of the teams.

786
00:55:56,849 --> 00:55:58,480
- Is the goal?
- No.

787
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,843
're together.
Has been that way for long.

788
00:56:05,264 --> 00:56:07,219
I left the game.

789
00:56:10,311 --> 00:56:11,927
Jess...

790
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,562
Regarding New Orleans...

791
00:56:17,563 --> 00:56:19,963
- Nicky.
- No, just...

792
00:56:19,964 --> 00:56:22,264
I do not really need an explanation.

793
00:56:22,883 --> 00:56:25,973
I mean, I'm the one who should thank
. You did me a favor.

794
00:56:28,205 --> 00:56:30,194
That's fantastic.

795
00:56:32,908 --> 00:56:35,818
Probably be wondering where I am. Take care of yourself, okay?

796
00:56:36,779 --> 00:56:38,469
You too, take care.

797
00:56:39,082 --> 00:56:44,009
Nicky... he does not know
my past, so...

798
00:56:46,777 --> 00:56:51,412
- You do not know me, okay?
- Okay.

799
00:56:51,413 --> 00:56:53,443
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

800
00:57:02,073 --> 00:57:04,258
Alcohol.

801
00:57:05,558 --> 00:57:07,860
- Vodka.
- Claro.

802
00:57:15,447 --> 00:57:19,595
- This Is Water.
- No, sir, is vodka.

803
00:57:19,596 --> 00:57:21,406
- Is water.
- Lord, I know who he is.

804
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:24,800
Marcelo told me you
and its condition. Go away.

805
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,801
Hell.

806
00:57:29,848 --> 00:57:32,115
Kidding.

807
00:57:45,109 --> 00:57:47,055
Are you drunk?

808
00:57:50,411 --> 00:57:53,520
Mr. Garriga
not a man who wants to face.

809
00:57:55,741 --> 00:57:57,671
Me neither.

810
00:57:59,413 --> 00:58:04,281
What part of your plan included
Appletinis be drinking?

811
00:58:05,203 --> 00:58:07,539
Are you in a fraternity?

812
00:58:09,283 --> 00:58:11,378
As I review the plan again a little.

813
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:16,329
Damn Prima donna, I do not think that garbage
delicate science.

814
00:58:16,383 --> 00:58:20,156
Not supposed to complicate,
friend. This is not science.

815
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:24,131
Just do what you paid
done. Useless.

816
00:58:43,316 --> 00:58:46,869
Hey, Garriga!

817
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,956
Do not worry.
It's just a drunk engineer.

818
00:58:53,278 --> 00:58:55,638
I think you have something to say.

819
00:58:57,292 --> 00:58:58,433
Shit.

820
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:03,254
- Why did you hit?
- Robbed Me! Nobody steals from me!

821
00:59:04,806 --> 00:59:08,318
- I'm an engineer discontent.
- Get him out of here!

822
00:59:09,209 --> 00:59:10,919
<i>off, get him out</i>

823
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:15,147
- You spent for action, do not you think.?
- It was the emotion of the moment.

824
00:59:15,448 --> 00:59:16,848
<i>Get him</i>

825
00:59:17,404 --> 00:59:18,686
Get rid of him.

826
00:59:18,723 --> 00:59:23,375
'm Fine, really.
Come back to the party.

827
00:59:25,209 --> 00:59:26,771
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

828
00:59:27,353 --> 00:59:30,762
- What was that?
- Business complicated, honey.

829
00:59:31,163 --> 00:59:32,413
's All.

830
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:36,717
Wait a minute.
Can not throw me out, I stay in this hotel.

831
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:39,033
Teach me your key, sir.

832
00:59:44,353 --> 00:59:46,181
Thanks.

833
00:59:54,994 --> 00:59:56,849
Mr. McEwen would like to invite him to lunch.

834
00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:58,750
Information is on the card.

835
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,633
I have the touch yet.

836
01:00:17,866 --> 01:00:19,900
Have you heard of
Udo Papenpus?

837
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,700
- What a view fuck?
- Nothing.

838
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,662
Sorry, what was in...

839
01:00:27,663 --> 01:00:33,063
Udo Papenpus was Ferrari engineer
years. It was brilliant.

840
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:37,433
One day he was found in a field
, cut his throat.

841
01:00:38,206 --> 01:00:41,633
Udo worked for Garriga secret.

842
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:46,327
- I want three million euros.
- Oh, heavens.

843
01:00:46,337 --> 01:00:49,282
- Is EXR.
- The EXR.

844
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,433
You're like the fucking Christmas to me, man.

845
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,980
Going to need to do some tests.

846
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,598
Do you understand?
Some tests.

847
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:04,600
- What a view fuck?
- Nothing, just repeat what you said.

848
01:01:05,533 --> 01:01:07,166
Are the girls?

849
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:13,533
Gordon, give me the damn
binoculars. They are there.

850
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:18,113
Yes, she is beautiful. A lovely whore
racing.

851
01:01:18,114 --> 01:01:20,305
- Is not a whore racing.
- Of course I do.

852
01:01:20,306 --> 01:01:21,733
The city is full of them.

853
01:01:21,766 --> 01:01:23,133
Can we return to the
business, please?

854
01:01:23,366 --> 01:01:25,166
A little flat above
but okay.

855
01:01:25,203 --> 01:01:27,426
What is small for each
for another is perfect.

856
01:01:27,466 --> 01:01:30,733
Is a subjective topic
opinion of everyone.

857
01:01:30,966 --> 01:01:32,666
That works for modeling magazines.

858
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,233
I'm talking about you damn
hit breasts.

859
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:36,983
Want the formula or not?

860
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,623
- I want to see the evidence.
-'ll Contact you.

861
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,366
- A spritz, please.
- Okay.

862
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,766
A
vodka cranberry juice, please.

863
01:01:52,466 --> 01:01:55,166
Hey, you need to put some clothes
.

864
01:01:56,300 --> 01:02:00,113
- Excuse me?
- There are people from australia here.

865
01:02:00,433 --> 01:02:02,666
- What does that mean?
- Just say, Jess.

866
01:02:02,933 --> 01:02:05,400
Deported those people
England for a reason.

867
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:08,909
Good.
Thank You.

868
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:11,410
What?

869
01:02:11,433 --> 01:02:13,300
Do you know, I
remember?

870
01:02:15,233 --> 01:02:17,066
What was that last night?

871
01:02:18,466 --> 01:02:20,866
Is that my fault?

872
01:02:21,566 --> 01:02:23,733
Please do not.

873
01:02:23,933 --> 01:02:28,008
- Are you trying to defraud Rafael?
- No, Jess, work for him.

874
01:02:28,018 --> 01:02:30,527
But do not rely on it if I were you.

875
01:02:30,627 --> 01:02:32,813
But should we trust you?

876
01:02:33,013 --> 01:02:34,988
- Jess, okay.
- It's interesting.

877
01:02:35,188 --> 01:02:37,034
- Come on.
- Nicky...

878
01:02:37,234 --> 01:02:40,633
If Rafael sees us together,
not know what will happen, right?

879
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:44,466
Is the jealous type.
So get away from me.

880
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:51,336
- Rafael Fuck!
- And Nicky, you're still easy to steal.

881
01:02:51,346 --> 01:02:53,712
To take my stuff, Jess.

882
01:02:58,866 --> 01:03:01,681
- Well?
- Looks great.

883
01:03:03,933 --> 01:03:06,915
- 3 million, right?
- Yes, sir.

884
01:03:06,925 --> 01:03:09,445
I have the full package in 48 hours.

885
01:03:09,446 --> 01:03:12,446
Codes,
documentation and analysis.

886
01:03:12,645 --> 01:03:15,875
Do not worry, partner. Do not worry. What next?

887
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,933
Wait for my call.

888
01:03:19,204 --> 01:03:20,734
Thanks.

889
01:03:27,517 --> 01:03:29,469
Mr. Garriga just called.

890
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:31,670
Said
show him things that might like it.

891
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:32,721
Perfect.

892
01:03:43,766 --> 01:03:46,620
Sorry.
Can I...?

893
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:51,606
Forgot... bag.

894
01:04:08,506 --> 01:04:11,568
You really should pay more attention.

895
01:04:13,033 --> 01:04:16,999
God! Really?

896
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,032
- Malbec?
- Right. Where did you learn that?

897
01:04:26,232 --> 01:04:30,137
It's what they drink here.
And what the label says.

898
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,624
Know, Nicky,
've been thinking about all this.

899
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:38,125
What?

900
01:04:41,966 --> 01:04:43,066
Y...

901
01:04:45,066 --> 01:04:47,920
- Nicky...
- You tell me.

902
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:52,138
Nicky, if only huyéramos.
Could, you know, get away...

903
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:53,139
Yes

904
01:04:53,148 --> 01:04:55,393
- we just...
- Whatever, yes..

905
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,980
I can not.

906
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,619
- I can not, sorry.
- Wait, wait, Jess.

907
01:05:06,866 --> 01:05:10,072
Whatever you want, I'll protect
.

908
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:14,607
- Nicky...
- Come on, Jess.

909
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:21,800
Nicky,
loved me so much.

910
01:05:23,066 --> 01:05:25,600
But I've learned a lot since then.

911
01:05:26,733 --> 01:05:32,953
And really
I would teach you everything I have learned.

912
01:05:37,766 --> 01:05:41,037
Now I know how to handle men.

913
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:43,796
As you just handle yourself.

914
01:05:48,171 --> 01:05:49,932
- How do you feel?
- Go!

915
01:05:49,933 --> 01:05:51,933
Yes, go.

916
01:05:52,166 --> 01:05:55,164
I think you're missing. That was pathetic.

917
01:05:55,266 --> 01:05:58,937
- "I'll protect you?" What was that?
- That was...

918
01:05:58,938 --> 01:06:01,885
- Does that work? Do you earn pickups?
- That was not a lie!

919
01:06:01,895 --> 01:06:06,523
Do not deceive me over with your
things, okay? And I'm very happy.

920
01:06:06,723 --> 01:06:08,778
So stay away from me.

921
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,779
Cute ass.
Cute ass, cute butt.

922
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:35,038
- My brother.
- Hey, I want a steak.

923
01:06:35,238 --> 01:06:38,918
- A fillet. What at 9:00 am?
- That is not a sin.

924
01:06:39,118 --> 01:06:41,463
- How was your flight?
- Jesus Christ!

925
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:43,464
Vine sandwiched between two fat.

926
01:06:43,663 --> 01:06:47,523
That sounds like a complaint.
Not because I should give you.

927
01:06:47,723 --> 01:06:49,239
<i>Well, where are you getting
</i>

928
01:06:55,733 --> 01:06:57,380
Have the piece?

929
01:06:57,381 --> 01:06:59,681
In my bag, grab it
because I can not.

930
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:02,576
Watch this.
I am the master.

931
01:07:07,233 --> 01:07:08,900
- Are you okay? .
- Yes

932
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,117
Are you okay?

933
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:22,803
- Hello!
- Farhad?

934
01:07:23,003 --> 01:07:25,650
Hi, how are you?

935
01:07:26,066 --> 01:07:29,633
God, look at you!
've Lost so much weight.

936
01:07:29,634 --> 01:07:31,034
Detoxification.

937
01:07:31,043 --> 01:07:34,059
- Have you heard of Nicky?
- More or less. Would you mind?

938
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,123
Please.

939
01:07:39,431 --> 01:07:41,867
You must be very excited with all these beautiful women
.

940
01:07:41,868 --> 01:07:44,522
- Do you suppose?
- You do more than guess.

941
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,126
What does that mean?

942
01:07:46,127 --> 01:07:47,927
- God!
- Just...

943
01:07:47,928 --> 01:07:49,928
Please
never put that face again.

944
01:07:49,936 --> 01:07:53,215
- I do not even want to know what it means.
- Yes, you do.

945
01:07:53,315 --> 01:07:56,788
- I think not. God missed you.
- Everyone knows you're a lesbian.

946
01:07:56,793 --> 01:07:58,621
- Who knows that?
- It's perfect for you.

947
01:07:58,622 --> 01:08:01,134
Where did you get that?

948
01:08:01,334 --> 01:08:03,357
Every time you speak,
smell like vagina.

949
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,779
- That's not true!
- Not a bad thing, believe me.

950
01:08:06,979 --> 01:08:09,024
- Jesus!
- OK.

951
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,457
- Listen, have you gone crazy Nicky!
- Really?

952
01:08:18,467 --> 01:08:19,487
- Yes
- Okay.

953
01:08:19,497 --> 01:08:22,295
Never seen her like this.
Almost no works from New Orleans.

954
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:28,062
- Really?
- Is not only an idiot, is one enormous.

955
01:08:28,072 --> 01:08:30,238
- Yes
- He must do better.

956
01:08:30,438 --> 01:08:34,175
But my friend, I have to
support. Do you give another chance?

957
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:38,570
I do not care what you
Nicky said. I'm not falling for that crap.

958
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,685
Maybe you did not understand.
Is now very different

959
01:08:41,686 --> 01:08:43,686
and I know for a long time.

960
01:08:45,033 --> 01:08:46,917
How do I know that?

961
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:50,810
- What is that?
- It's an orange.

962
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,242
What saved for you all this time.

963
01:09:00,866 --> 01:09:02,166
Better save it.

964
01:09:05,366 --> 01:09:07,152
Shit.

965
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:13,985
You look very good.

966
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:17,416
I can not believe I
shalt observe or find him.

967
01:09:17,966 --> 01:09:21,214
Or replicaras.
Contigo is not known.

968
01:09:21,224 --> 01:09:23,427
- I kept it.
- Thank You.

969
01:09:23,866 --> 01:09:26,547
Farhad
said you had not worked in a while.

970
01:09:26,548 --> 01:09:28,548
Yes
makes a couple of years.

971
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:31,225
I was not feeling well.

972
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:36,047
Went back to see my father,
had not seen in years.

973
01:09:36,057 --> 01:09:38,484
I asked if you had lived honestly
.

974
01:09:38,494 --> 01:09:41,129
Sure,
I did when I was on probation.

975
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:44,640
- I'm good, like a man.
- Good advice.

976
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:45,953
Yes

977
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:50,557
- How will that work?
- I was ready to work.

978
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:59,493
- And the girl appeared.
- What you give many laps, Nicky?

979
01:10:01,733 --> 01:10:03,600
What do you want from me?

980
01:10:05,566 --> 01:10:07,766
I convince whoever is anything.

981
01:10:09,233 --> 01:10:11,500
Once convinced that a man


982
01:10:11,501 --> 01:10:13,501
An empty warehouse was the Federal Reserve.

983
01:10:13,733 --> 01:10:15,744
- So I'm good.
- Yes.

984
01:10:17,366 --> 01:10:20,514
- You're the best.
- But what I really want...

985
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,693
is you see I
changed and I'm sorry.

986
01:10:26,133 --> 01:10:28,236
I just want you to believe me.

987
01:10:39,933 --> 01:10:42,968
Know, I want to believe you,
really want to believe.

988
01:10:44,466 --> 01:10:45,633
'm Different.

989
01:10:51,133 --> 01:10:53,000
Have to go back.

990
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,637
I can not do this, sorry.

991
01:11:17,518 --> 01:11:18,832
<i>Move</i>

992
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:58,736
- Are you okay? What happened?
- I want to talk.

993
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:00,505
- Did he do anything?
- No.

994
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:06,427
- Jess, are you hit? Tell me what happened.
- Just kiss me.

995
01:13:00,666 --> 01:13:02,821
Soon I will have to leave.

996
01:13:04,433 --> 01:13:06,333
I want you to come with me.

997
01:13:08,033 --> 01:13:10,300
I know you think you love him.

998
01:13:12,233 --> 01:13:13,300
But...

999
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:16,677
want you to come with me tonight.

1000
01:13:20,466 --> 01:13:25,574
- Do not love, just that....
- I just do not trust me.

1001
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:31,009
I understand. If you accept
come, arrange us.

1002
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:33,736
I...

1003
01:13:44,033 --> 01:13:46,166
Is Owens,
must answer.

1004
01:13:49,128 --> 01:13:50,824
- Yes?
- Where are you?

1005
01:13:51,024 --> 01:13:53,078
- In my room.
- Well, I'm at the door.

1006
01:13:54,278 --> 01:13:55,987
's In the door.

1007
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:57,789
- Yeah, well.
- What?

1008
01:13:57,989 --> 01:13:59,671
Damn, you should warn
.

1009
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,561
Okay,
give me a second.

1010
01:14:02,266 --> 01:14:05,541
're Fine.
I get rid of it.

1011
01:14:07,202 --> 01:14:08,542
Hello.

1012
01:14:11,166 --> 01:14:14,500
Do you still asleep?
I thought you had a meeting with McEwen.

1013
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:16,433
The'll,
later.

1014
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:23,443
There is some softness and laziness in your generation
,

1015
01:14:23,444 --> 01:14:25,444
makes me feel uncomfortable.

1016
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:31,202
I like to be more active.
I will rest when you have cancer.

1017
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:32,866
O when having sex.

1018
01:14:33,066 --> 01:14:37,333
Both are part of my
story, in case you are wondering you.

1019
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,411
Actually no, do not ask me, but thanks for sharing
.

1020
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:45,921
Sarcasm, another
evil of your generation.

1021
01:14:45,922 --> 01:14:49,022
If you want to tell someone to go to hell
, you would say.

1022
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:52,300
Do not tell: Heaven, you have a
great jacket! Is weak.

1023
01:14:53,433 --> 01:14:57,975
- This is a messy bed.
- Yeah, I do not sleep well.

1024
01:14:58,433 --> 01:15:01,127
- Does anyone here, son?
- Who you calling "son"?

1025
01:15:01,327 --> 01:15:03,586
<i>- You know why you do not sleep well? .
- No, tell me</i>

1026
01:15:03,786 --> 01:15:08,590
For your iphone, your phone
intelligent, laptops and computers.

1027
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:12,333
All
only produce a huge amount of useless information.

1028
01:15:12,766 --> 01:15:14,400
Cursed Twiter.

1029
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:19,171
As if anyone really cared
they are eating

1030
01:15:19,172 --> 01:15:20,572
One sandwish turkey.

1031
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,200
Sorry.
"Sandwich."

1032
01:15:24,566 --> 01:15:26,433
- Sarcasm?
- Satire.

1033
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:29,801
<i>- Cursed sandwich!
- Watch...</i>

1034
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:32,834
Are we done?

1035
01:15:33,034 --> 01:15:36,825
You maybe. Who did you go to the airport to pick
?

1036
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,982
<i>- Garriga commanded you follow me?
- I have my sources</i>

1037
01:15:40,182 --> 01:15:42,861
<i>- A computer expert.
- Why? Problem</i>

1038
01:15:43,061 --> 01:15:45,333
<i>Now that you're here,

I have a little red hair in the crotch

1040
01:15:50,234 --> 01:15:52,334

1041
01:15:52,433 --> 01:15:58,281
And lately I
I scratch the balls like a fucking monkey.

1042
01:16:01,133 --> 01:16:02,366
Okay.

1043
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:08,605
Look, there's no reason anyone
panic.

1044
01:16:09,305 --> 01:16:13,881
And start
accelerated because we near the end.

1045
01:16:44,861 --> 01:16:47,101
May you have a good day.

1046
01:16:52,206 --> 01:16:53,933
Nicky!

1047
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,433
How the fuck you crossed?

1048
01:17:00,633 --> 01:17:04,345
- Return to seven.
- Okay.

1049
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,666
I think your hair
was wrong.

1050
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:11,800
Suffice of formalisms.

1051
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,309
- Hey, nice jacket.
- Fuck!

1052
01:17:24,433 --> 01:17:27,023
Is authentic.
Gordon!

1053
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,666
Gordon!

1054
01:17:31,266 --> 01:17:35,809
Back to you, friend.
You're my new favorite person.

1055
01:17:36,009 --> 01:17:38,066
I promise to make you look tall and most handsome

1056
01:17:38,067 --> 01:17:40,467
when you decided to put one foot on the racetrack.

1057
01:17:40,633 --> 01:17:42,987
Here,
son. Enjoy it.

1058
01:17:44,208 --> 01:17:46,588
Been a pleasure, sir
McEwen. I wish you good luck.

1059
01:17:46,597 --> 01:17:50,560
With friends like you, who needs luck
? Now get out.

1060
01:17:52,366 --> 01:17:53,980
- Yes?
- Mr Garriga.

1061
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,164
- How did it go?
- It's done.

1062
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,784
- Well.
- I wish you luck.

What?

1081
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:12,461
- Nothing, let's go.
- All Right.

1091
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:27,404
I really you think as amateur as

1092
01:23:27,405 --> 01:23:29,305
not have someone with McEwen?

1093
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:31,290
Someone to watch over you?

1094
01:23:33,733 --> 01:23:38,410
20 years in this business, you do
be very cautious.

1095
01:23:39,633 --> 01:23:41,361
He's my secret weapon.

1096
01:23:41,362 --> 01:23:45,442
Now, imagine my surprise when Gordon

1097
01:23:45,443 --> 01:23:47,943
showed me what you sold
McEwen.

1098
01:23:47,952 --> 01:23:54,661
Not a fake software such as
agreed, but my plan, my design.

1099
01:23:54,671 --> 01:23:58,778
True
EXR stolen from my servers! That you stole!

1100
01:23:58,788 --> 01:24:02,233
Why?
I bought McEwen three million euros...

1101
01:24:02,433 --> 01:24:05,580
But these bags there are 27 million!

1102
01:24:06,201 --> 01:24:08,581
What it means is that you sold
everyone!

1103
01:24:09,066 --> 01:24:12,267
This is my reputation!
It's my reputation!

1104
01:24:12,268 --> 01:24:14,268
Made me look like a beginner.

1105
01:24:23,133 --> 01:24:25,076
That's what you get when you hire a scammer
.

1106
01:24:25,766 --> 01:24:29,498
- Piece of living crap.
- How did you get the information?

1107
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:38,002
- And what she had to do with it?
- Nothing. Okay, listen.

1108
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:40,606
- Tell me!
- Hey!

1109
01:24:55,676 --> 01:24:56,736
Tell me!

1110
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:08,191
Leave her alone! I'll tell you!
I am a man.

1111
01:25:11,733 --> 01:25:13,687
Cracking your encryption.

1112
01:25:13,688 --> 01:25:15,988
He found a back door and entered your server.

1113
01:25:16,166 --> 01:25:19,441
It was very simple.
I think you should fire your computer.

1114
01:25:19,451 --> 01:25:22,028
No, no.
Put my user name and password.

1115
01:25:22,228 --> 01:25:24,333
The program generates all possible combinations.

1116
01:25:24,334 --> 01:25:25,934
Lie!

1117
01:25:26,766 --> 01:25:30,166
This generates a new password every 15 minutes.

1118
01:25:30,266 --> 01:25:31,832
And never lose sight.

1119
01:25:33,033 --> 01:25:35,166
- How do you get it?
- Who cares? It is done.

1120
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,700
Okay.

1121
01:25:39,966 --> 01:25:41,066
Tell me.

1122
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,888
- I want to know how!
- Leave her alone!

1123
01:25:43,898 --> 01:25:46,149
- How, how, how?
- Leave her alone!

1124
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:49,589
- How?
- It was her. Was she right?

1125
01:25:49,966 --> 01:25:51,066
Was it.

1126
01:25:53,266 --> 01:25:54,400
Was it.

1127
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:57,833
But I did not.

1128
01:25:59,566 --> 01:26:01,151
I knew nothing.

1129
01:26:05,681 --> 01:26:06,880
Good.

1130
01:26:08,466 --> 01:26:11,777
Your security was good.
It was better than I expected.

1131
01:26:11,977 --> 01:26:14,920
<i>
thought you could break the encryption but I could </i>.

1132
01:26:16,433 --> 01:26:18,373
Then I saw Jess at your party.

1133
01:26:18,766 --> 01:26:24,031
Once
knew they were together, I knew it was my entry.

1134
01:26:24,041 --> 01:26:25,422
So I used it.

1135
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:27,491
And I've been using.

1136
01:26:28,966 --> 01:26:32,133
There is a science to
people trust you.

1137
01:26:32,366 --> 01:26:35,420
<i>With women
all about emotion, connection</i>

1138
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,690
<i>That feel the emotion as strong as them
</i>

1139
01:26:39,566 --> 01:26:42,950
Dream of that nonsense
since they are girls.

1140
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:45,879
<i>With it, I used our history
</i>

1141
01:26:46,233 --> 01:26:51,384
<i>A friendly face, cleared of
balance and stopped assaulting</i>

1142
01:26:51,433 --> 01:26:54,276
<i>I started
you emotionally closer to it</i>

1143
01:26:54,476 --> 01:26:57,330
<i>already disarmed, was now open
</i>

1144
01:26:57,340 --> 01:27:00,770
know you have someone when
begins to imitate unconsciously.

1145
01:27:00,833 --> 01:27:03,533
<i>Nodding,
the hand gestures</i>

1146
01:27:03,534 --> 01:27:05,234
<i>means that are in sync
</i>

1147
01:27:05,243 --> 01:27:09,280
Sociologists call it.
"The reaction de Gauche. "

1148
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,633
<i>And then comes the knockout
</i>

1149
01:27:11,866 --> 01:27:14,066
<i>Les
say how much you have changed...</i>

1150
01:27:14,266 --> 01:27:15,600
I am different, Jess.

1151
01:27:16,166 --> 01:27:18,033
How to change your worldview.

1152
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:23,323
<i>Then shut with a talisman, a gift that says

<i>The necklace had a

1155
01:27:30,201 --> 01:27:32,682
<i>All I needed was
to come into your room </i>.

1156
01:27:32,882 --> 01:27:35,223
That issue was not important.

1157
01:27:35,533 --> 01:27:39,050
And when did that,
I had what I needed.

1158
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:40,927
<i>I'm not interested, really

1159

01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,033
Sorry.

1162
01:27:59,266 --> 01:28:02,166
But it was not his fault.

1163
01:28:02,733 --> 01:28:06,315
She had no idea.
It was deceived.

1164
01:28:07,166 --> 01:28:09,206
Why do not you let it go?

1165
01:28:10,233 --> 01:28:13,616
You and I can do everything
how fucked you need to do.

1166
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,746
- This guy lost his mind.
- What is grace?

1167
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,921
- All garbage.
- What's so funny?

1168
01:28:51,066 --> 01:28:52,592
More lies.

1169

- I barely know.

1172
01:29:04,462 --> 01:29:07,346

- But I saw you...
- No, you saw what I wanted you to see.

1174

You taught me that, remember?

1175

's Been going crazy.
Hang out, flirt, flirts.

1176

I want to upload it to my room...

- Do Not!

1194
01:30:09,127 --> 01:30:12,772
- He was the one who did it.
- She was stealing.

1195
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:15,110
I discovered making charges to the credit card Garriga

1196

- and gave me a fright.
- That's fucking awesome.

1197

You did all that for me jealous?

1198
01:30:21,633 --> 01:30:24,338
No, that was a part of
revenge for New Orleans, but...

1199
01:30:24,866 --> 01:30:28,665
- Yes, to make you jealous.
- I can not believe you lied to me.

1200

- Can not believe that lie?
- I can not believe it.

1201

- Can not believe it?
- I do not think so.

- Because you that's classic, classic.
- Is that what you mean me?

1203

- Yes! Everything is working, everything.
- Are you sure?

1204
01:30:38,333 --> 01:30:41,463
- For trying to save your life.
- Lying!

1205

Because they always lie, Nicky!
Do not know when you tell the truth!

01:31:20,133 --> 01:31:22,172
This is the issue with
lies. This is the problem...

1210
01:31:22,173 --> 01:31:23,473
You fuck options.

1211
01:31:23,672 --> 01:31:27,714
- It puts you in a corner.
- What the fuck you talking about? Are you crazy?

1212
01:31:27,724 --> 01:31:31,683
And you're forced to do something really stupid
.

1213
01:31:31,684 --> 01:31:33,684
You want to die?

1214
01:31:33,883 --> 01:31:35,989
If I die, I will
telling the truth.

1215
01:31:36,433 --> 01:31:40,600
If I lie wanna do like normal people lie.

1216
01:31:40,933 --> 01:31:45,445
If my wife asks me, "Hey
darling, do I look fat in these jeans

1217
01:31:45,466 --> 01:31:49,213
I mean?" No,
love, beautiful lights "

1218
01:31:49,413 --> 01:31:50,928
" You should wear them. ".

1219
01:31:51,566 --> 01:31:53,500
This is how
want to lie.

1220
01:31:54,266 --> 01:31:55,866
But this...

1221
01:31:57,133 --> 01:31:58,633
If dead...

1222
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:01,812
'll tell the truth.

1223
01:32:03,533 --> 01:32:07,533
Well, Mr. Garriga,
I will tell the truth.

1224
01:32:09,966 --> 01:32:13,566
And you would not like at all.

1225
01:32:17,266 --> 01:32:19,326
A year ago I picked up the phone...

1226
01:32:19,666 --> 01:32:21,807
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Nicky!

1227
01:32:22,114 --> 01:32:24,714
I could not stand another fucking word.

1228
01:32:24,813 --> 01:32:27,440
- You're next, sweetheart.
- No, are you crazy?

1229
01:32:28,203 --> 01:32:30,699
- Nicky.
- What the hell thought?

1230
01:32:31,433 --> 01:32:32,886
Fuck!

1231
01:32:35,033 --> 01:32:39,315
Someone is injured.
Not have anything to do with it.

1232
01:32:39,316 --> 01:32:40,986
Nicky, listen

No, no, no! Look at me, look at me

1236
01:32:56,276 --> 01:32:59,977

1237
01:32:59,978 --> 01:33:00,978

I trust you!

1240
01:33:16,066 --> 01:33:18,365
You can not leave me again.

1241
01:33:19,833 --> 01:33:22,186
Please do not let me
again.

1242
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:28,300
Please.

1243
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:41,113
What the fuck! Would you die?
What kind of stinging you, God?

1244
01:33:42,933 --> 01:33:46,614
Shit! Did not like it worked infiltrated
?

1245
01:33:46,814 --> 01:33:49,801
God!
You must be terrified.

1246
01:33:50,066 --> 01:33:55,014
'll Be fine, you will not die.
Do you hear me? She did not die.

1247
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,090
Probably.

1248
01:33:57,290 --> 01:34:00,974
Le
shoot between the third and fourth rib, just to

1249
01:34:00,975 --> 01:34:03,375
11:00 o'clock
left nipple.

1250
01:34:03,376 --> 01:34:06,358
- Press then press there.
- Okay.

1251
01:34:06,666 --> 01:34:09,584
No
touch the heart and major arteries.

1252
01:34:09,784 --> 01:34:13,289
However, pierces the lung.
Let me in, here we go.

1253
01:34:13,489 --> 01:34:17,435
- This is the Panic Button Toledo?
- You may not be so stingy.

1254
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:21,431
If left untreated, you have
about ten minutes before

1255
01:34:21,432 --> 01:34:24,432
drown in your own blood but...

1256
01:34:24,441 --> 01:34:28,805
What parchas.
You measure the cavity pressure...

1257
01:34:30,538 --> 01:34:33,407
- God!
- And then...

1258
01:34:36,067 --> 01:34:38,916
Here we go!
Here we go! Here we go!

1259
01:34:38,917 --> 01:34:40,417
That's my boy.

1260
01:34:41,218 --> 01:34:42,518
Yes

1261
01:34:44,666 --> 01:34:45,966
Are you okay?

1262
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:50,233
Click here.

1263
01:34:50,433 --> 01:34:53,334
Watch him if you can not breathe
pumped again, okay?

1264
01:34:53,335 --> 01:34:54,256
Okay.

1265
01:34:54,266 --> 01:34:57,396
I can not believe you shoot
hicieras.

1266
01:34:57,596 --> 01:35:01,302
What for? To give a harlot
idiotices career.

1267
01:35:01,566 --> 01:35:04,292
- I'm not a whore career.
- She is not a whore career.

1268
01:35:04,492 --> 01:35:08,660
You died with lies,
mellow. And yet you could die.

1269
01:35:08,666 --> 01:35:12,428
- I do not like you to call me mellow.
- Are you his father?

1270
01:35:12,633 --> 01:35:14,966
Is absurd at all possible terms.

1271
01:35:15,666 --> 01:35:20,049
By the way, I'm Bucky.
I like you, baby you're rude.

1272
01:35:21,466 --> 01:35:25,536
There. I tell you something, steals a car while I am
money.

1273
01:35:25,546 --> 01:35:27,391
Can not steal a car.

1274
01:35:34,533 --> 01:35:38,014
I was working for that kind for three years.

1275
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:41,545
He was a man with
McEwen and did not tell me.

1276
01:35:41,546 --> 01:35:43,546
What the fuck happened to trust?

1277
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,100
Did we get?

1278
01:35:45,333 --> 01:35:47,666
Risked my ass for that crap EXR.

1279
01:35:49,366 --> 01:35:51,395
And then came the girl.

1280
01:35:51,595 --> 01:35:56,005
- Do not be so stupid.
- So you talk to your father?

1281
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:59,278
You're not my father abandoned me
.

1282
01:36:09,266 --> 01:36:14,225
I took you off the streets.
I taught my business and my passion.

1283
01:36:16,133 --> 01:36:18,715
Three generations of experience.

1284
01:36:21,066 --> 01:36:26,639
And despite all my efforts
, and my hard work,

1285
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:31,803
you become a good
person. Well, I just... you know.

1286
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:37,533
And I left you in the street
a damn good reason.

1287
01:36:38,133 --> 01:36:39,529
Because it was soft.

1288
01:36:39,729 --> 01:36:43,500
That just shows what
know, you son of a bitch.

1289
01:36:51,533 --> 01:36:53,366
We had a very good thing.

1290
01:36:55,533 --> 01:36:58,331
And then one day...

1291
01:36:58,866 --> 01:37:02,067
Seven years later in a poker game
Boston,

1292
01:37:02,267 --> 01:37:03,799
one guy pulled a gun.

1293
01:37:03,999 --> 01:37:07,260
A damn gun, a Glock.
It was the first time I saw one.

1294
01:37:07,533 --> 01:37:09,966
I just froze me.

1295
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,000
And all I could think about was
that child.

1296
01:37:17,833 --> 01:37:20,466
I left and never looked back.

1297
01:37:25,733 --> 01:37:27,900
Love can kill you in this business.

1298
01:37:29,943 --> 01:37:31,779
There is no place for that here.

1299
01:37:32,233 --> 01:37:33,966
There is no happiness in that.

1300
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:40,066
Have you heard that saying: "There
honor among thieves."

1301
01:37:41,133 --> 01:37:43,192
Well you're not a thief, mellow.

1302
01:37:46,066 --> 01:37:48,160
Took your decision.

1303
01:37:52,533 --> 01:37:54,033
So I'll take the money.

1304
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,233
All.

1305
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:09,020
- Well, that explains a lot.
- Yes, that's dad.

1306
01:38:10,133 --> 01:38:11,946
- No!
- Yup!

1307
01:38:12,146 --> 01:38:13,742
- No!
- Yup!

1308
01:38:16,243 --> 01:38:17,543
Shit.

1309
01:38:18,066 --> 01:38:19,961
See you at Christmas.

1310
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,760
One, Two, Three...

1311
01:38:30,166 --> 01:38:32,366
Well, okay.

1312
01:38:33,133 --> 01:38:35,860
Well, almost there.

1313
01:38:36,233 --> 01:38:38,725
What shall we do now?

1314
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:41,983
'll Be fine.

1315
01:38:42,466 --> 01:38:43,633
How?

1316
01:38:44,633 --> 01:38:45,833
Trust me.

1317
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:58,123
Okay.

1318
01:39:13,124 --> 01:41:59,124
