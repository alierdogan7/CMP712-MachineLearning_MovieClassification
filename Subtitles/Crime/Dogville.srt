1
00:00:22,376 --> 00:00:26,022
Dogville was in the Rocky Mountains
in the US of A.

2
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:32,682
Up here where the road came to its
definiteve end near the entrance to the old,
abandoned silver mine.

3
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:38,574
The residents of Dogville were good,
honest folks and they liked their township.

4
00:00:38,674 --> 00:00:43,708
And while a sentimental soul from the East Coast
had once dubbed their main street ELM STREET,

5
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:46,700
though no elm tree had ever
cast its shadow in Dogville,

6
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:50,065
they saw no reason to change anything.

7
00:00:50,597 --> 00:00:55,857
Most of the buildings were pretty wretched;
more like shacks; frankly.

8
00:00:56,043 --> 00:00:59,100
The house in which Tome lived
was the best, though,

9
00:00:59,155 --> 00:01:03,815
and in good times might almost
have passed for presentable.

10
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:07,969
That afternoon the radio was playing softly,

11
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:15,894
for in his dotage Thomas Edison Senior
had developed a weakness for music of the lighter kind.

12
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:21,270
[Radio Presenter] Ladies and Gentlemen...
the President of the United States...

13
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:25,564
Tom, do me a favor, will you?
The radio!?

14
00:01:26,024 --> 00:01:30,017
Just because the music's over and
you might risk hearing something useful?

15
00:01:30,972 --> 00:01:33,444
I thought that's why we have the radio...

16
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,117
Well, I need a rest, as you know.

17
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:39,029
Mock me if you like.

18
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:44,330
[Narrator] Tom's father had been a doctor
and now received a modest pension,

19
00:01:44,347 --> 00:01:49,921
so it was no great disaster for Tom
to drift about not doing anything in particular.

20
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:54,507
Tom was a writer.
...at any rate by his own lights.

21
00:01:54,527 --> 00:02:00,940
Oh, his output as committed to paper
was so far limited to the words "great" and "small",

22
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,000
followed by question mark,

23
00:02:03,026 --> 00:02:08,797
but nevertheless meticulously archived
in one of his many bureau drawers.

24
00:02:09,793 --> 00:02:10,927
'Bye, Dad.

25
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:17,400
Evenin' Master Tom.

26
00:02:17,444 --> 00:02:19,404
Good evening, Master Olivia.

27
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:21,155
Don't forget about the meeting tomorrow.

28
00:02:21,185 --> 00:02:22,344
Noooo

29
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:32,813
[Narrator] In order to postpone the time
at which he would have to put pen to pater in earnest,

30
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,600
Tom had now come up with
a series of meetings on moral rearmament

31
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,950
with which he felt obliged to benefit the town.

32
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,957
- Hi, kids.
- Hi, Tom.

33
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:45,025
Good evening Chuck.

34
00:02:45,404 --> 00:02:47,886
Will we see you at the meeting tomorrow?

35
00:02:47,986 --> 00:02:50,271
Well, I could do without your lectures.

36
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:51,842
You know Vera.

37
00:02:52,196 --> 00:02:55,210
Wouldn't give me moment's peace
till I said yes.

38
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,697
Who gave Moses that bone?
It's still got meat on it.

39
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:02,513
Jason did.

40
00:03:02,613 --> 00:03:05,094
Jason gave that mutt a bone
with meat on it?

41
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:08,182
When did we last see meat?

42
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:11,670
Next time you waste good food,
I'll take your knife away.

43
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,569
I would know it was you give'n meat to eat.

44
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:16,536
Moses was meant to be hungry! To keep watch.

45
00:03:16,606 --> 00:03:18,613
Keep watch in Dogville?

46
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:21,056
What's there to steal?

47
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,511
These are wicked time, Tom Edison.

48
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:27,164
Soon there'll be folks by
with even less than us.

49
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,244
[Narrator] Indeed..Tom was busy enough,
even though, formally speaking,

50
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:41,446
not yet busy with writing per se.

51
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,864
And if a body found it hard to grasp
what profession he was busy at,

52
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:48,800
he'd merely reply "mining".

53
00:03:48,943 --> 00:03:51,751
For although he did not blast
his way through rock,

54
00:03:51,807 --> 00:03:54,314
he blasted through what was even harder...

55
00:03:54,952 --> 00:03:59,539
namely, the human soul...
right into where it glistered!

56
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,000
- Hey, Martha.
- Hello, Tom.

57
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:04,704
Listen, they're all comin',
so you just have those benches ready.

58
00:04:04,804 --> 00:04:06,314
Yes, they're ready.

59
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,800
Oh, but Tom, I repeat,
if you need to use my organ

60
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,655
I got to get special permission
from the regional director, Tom.

61
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,641
Martha, and I repeat,
we don't need the organ.

62
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:19,003
We can be spiritual without singing
or reading from the Bible.

63
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,248
It's almost seven.
Don't forget your bell now.

64
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:25,945
I imagine that'll do Ma Ginger.

65
00:04:25,995 --> 00:04:29,444
I don't think it's good for the soil
with all the raking and hoeing.

66
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:33,039
It's the soil that gave life to us all.

67
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,833
Don't give me any of your lip,
Thomas Edison Jr.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,409
I'll hoe as I darn well please!

69
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,701
Yeah, and spoil the whole thing!
I agree with Tom.

70
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:46,032
Yeah, well he likes eating my pies,
don't you?

71
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:48,774
Well they're tasty.
No doubt about it.

72
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:51,700
Yeah. So when it comes to hoeing,
who's right, Tom, you or me?

73
00:04:51,822 --> 00:04:53,800
I'm not so sure it's that simple.

74
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,590
He's got you there Ginger.

75
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,589
You can not resist,
can you, Gloria?

76
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:00,905
Hey, Ben, I'll get the doors!

77
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,079
I'll be fine, Tom.

78
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:04,500
Any news from the freight industry?

79
00:05:04,552 --> 00:05:06,500
Is everything going to hell there too?

80
00:05:06,537 --> 00:05:09,491
Don't poke fun at the freight industry.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,198
[Narrator] It was seven o'clock precisely,
as Martha chimed the hour,

82
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:23,124
and Tom was due to play checkers
with his childhood friend Bill Henson.

83
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,850
Bill was dumb and knew it.

84
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:31,697
Far too dumb to qualify as an engineer,
he was certainly sure of that.

85
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:39,819
After listening for a while to the piledriver
down the valley that Ben insisted was working
on the foundation of a new penitentiary,

86
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,602
Tom headed for the Henson home
in order to inflict upon Bill

87
00:05:43,687 --> 00:05:47,249
yet another humiliating defeat at checkers.

88
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:55,072
Some folks might say the opportunity
to meet Bill's older sister, Liz, was more of a draw
than the checkerboard,

89
00:05:55,132 --> 00:05:57,344
and they might be right.

90
00:05:57,912 --> 00:06:02,330
It was a fact that in the Henson home
lay another horizon.

91
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:06,845
A horizon just as alluring
as the one beyond the valley.

92
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:11,602
A horizon bound by Liz Henson's
luscious curves.

93
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:16,323
- No one's getting it? 
- A sweet, painful, seductive abyss.

94
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,050
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey, Tom.

95
00:06:18,075 --> 00:06:21,986
Must you come by every single day?
Huh!?

96
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:25,064
It'd be a lot more fun if someone
interesting appeared for a change.

97
00:06:25,913 --> 00:06:28,730
You know I really am so lonesome in this town.

98
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:33,713
The moment my fiancee writes
that he's gotten that job in Bolder, I'm off.

99
00:06:33,813 --> 00:06:36,852
Then the whole lot of you will
have to find some other girls' skirts to peek up.

100
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,890
Is.. uh.. Bill in?

101
00:06:39,372 --> 00:06:41,473
Well, isn't he always?

102
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,400
He studies and I help out with the glasses.

103
00:06:44,429 --> 00:06:47,298
Even though everybody knows
that I'm the clever one.

104
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:50,372
- Hey, Mrs. Henson.
- Good evening, Tom.

105
00:06:50,731 --> 00:06:53,529
Checkers time, Bill ol' Buddy.

106
00:06:55,204 --> 00:06:56,435
Was that..??

107
00:06:56,846 --> 00:06:58,904
You didn't hear the bell?

108
00:07:00,073 --> 00:07:04,542
[Narrator] As usual Bill tried to fake
his way around actually playing.

109
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:09,374
He had not yet fully comprehend
this meeting business, he claimed.

110
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,096
Maybe you should just let them be?

111
00:07:12,106 --> 00:07:13,700
I don't think so... I... I...

112
00:07:13,796 --> 00:07:16,105
What if they're just fine as they are?

113
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:18,800
You think they're fine?
I don't think so.

114
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,900
I think there is a lot
this country has forgotten.

115
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:24,707
I just try and refresh folk's memory
by way of illustration.

116
00:07:24,907 --> 00:07:26,756
So... so the illustration for tomorrow?

117
00:07:26,762 --> 00:07:29,124
mmmh.. I don't know.

118
00:07:30,873 --> 00:07:34,300
See if the people of Dogville have
a problem with the acceptance.

119
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:37,834
What they really need is something
for them to accept,

120
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:41,631
something tangible,
like a gift.

121
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:45,900
Why in the heck would someone
up and give us a gift?

122
00:07:45,938 --> 00:07:47,324
I don't know.

123
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:49,404
I might have to do some thinking.

124
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:56,483
Wait, wait, .. the ...
we're missing a piece.

125
00:07:57,097 --> 00:07:58,921
We won't be able to play.

126
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:11,174
My mind is sharp tonight.

127
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,591
'Night, Bill.

128
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:40,822
[Narrator] Despite considerable effort
on his part to prolong things,

129
00:08:40,872 --> 00:08:44,553
Tom had achieved the triumph
at the checkerboard pretty quickly.

130
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,600
It had started to rain and
the wind had become a regular gale

131
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:51,581
when Tom strolled home through Elm Street.

132
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:58,455
If Tom were to prove that the citizens of Dogville
had a problem receiving in his lecture in the next day

133
00:08:58,555 --> 00:09:02,773
he sorely lacked an illustration,
a gift.

134
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,922
Bill might have been right.

135
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:09,453
It hadn't exactly rained gifts 
on this particular township.

136
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,366
There was no doubt in his mind.

137
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:50,550
They were gun shots.

138
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,511
The pile driver in the marshes
didn't sound like that at all.

139
00:09:54,611 --> 00:09:56,726
The shots had come from down in the valley,

140
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,773
or perhaps from Canyon Road some place
in the direction of Georgetown.

141
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:08,777
He listened for more shots for ages.
But they were not repeated.

142
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:16,042
A tad disappointed, Tom sat down
on the old lady's bench to think,

143
00:10:16,092 --> 00:10:19,613
to hang onto the feeling of danger
for a moment.

144
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:25,379
But it wasn't long before his thoughts
were back on his favorite subjects again,

145
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:31,272
and in the midst of the storm they metamorphosed
into articles and novels and great gatherings

146
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:39,388
that'd listen in silence to Tom after the publication
of yet another volume that scourged and purged the human soul.

147
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,600
And he saw men,
and among them even other writers,

148
00:10:43,624 --> 00:10:50,175
throw their arms round one another as,
through his words, life had opened up for them anew.

149
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:52,603
It hadn't been easy.

150
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:59,415
But by his diligence and application
to narrative and drama his message had gotten through,

151
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:04,732
and asked about his technique he would
have to say but one word:

152
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:07,626
"illustration".

153
00:11:25,871 --> 00:11:29,511
Tom could have spent another
half hour or more on the bench,

154
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:33,186
but another unusual noise roused him.

155
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:35,763
It was Moses barking.

156
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:40,707
Oh, that wasn't unusual in itself,
but it was the way he barked that was new.

157
00:11:40,948 --> 00:11:44,214
His barking was not loud,
but more of a snarl,

158
00:11:44,264 --> 00:11:50,371
as if the danger was quite close at hand
and not merely a passing raccoon or fox.

159
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:57,364
as if the dog were standing face to face
with a force to be taken seriously.

160
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:03,413
Hey, Lady!
I wouldn't go up there if I were you.

161
00:12:05,422 --> 00:12:10,233
I know the mountain well,
I doubt if I'd get away with my life.

162
00:12:10,332 --> 00:12:12,162
It's a very nasty drop.

163
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:20,006
Is there another way?

164
00:12:20,754 --> 00:12:21,743
Yeah.

165
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:26,707
Where?

166
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:31,675
Back down the way you came from.
Back down to Georgetown.

167
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:34,646
Why do you need to get out of the mountain?

168
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:37,854
Did you have anything to do
with those gunshots?

169
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,820
Help me, help me please.

170
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,328
You can hide in the mine,
in there!

171
00:12:57,063 --> 00:12:58,609
Hey, where's this road headed to?

172
00:12:58,669 --> 00:13:00,700
No where. It's a dead end.

173
00:13:00,742 --> 00:13:04,960
If you want to pass, turn around,
go back by way of Georgetown.

174
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,773
This place... uh..
it's called Dogville.

175
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,176
Dogville? Well it figures,
it's a stupid name if I ever heard one.

176
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:14,132
Hey, we're looking for somebody...

177
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,025
Oh, really, who might that be?

178
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,415
My boss wants to talk to ya.

179
00:13:20,807 --> 00:13:22,686
- Young man.
- Yes, sir.

180
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,700
I'm looking for a girl. She may have made
her way to your town in her confusion.

181
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,550
I don't want any harm to come to her.
You see, she's very precious to me.

182
00:13:33,585 --> 00:13:36,900
Well sir, uh..
nobody's been through Dogville recently.

183
00:13:36,922 --> 00:13:40,635
Moses would have barked.
He's very suspicious of strangers.

184
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,726
Ah ha.. That's very wise Moses.

185
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,600
Please take my card and if perhaps..
uh.. you see a stranger,

186
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,313
give me a call.

187
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:57,423
I am in a position to offer
a considerable reward.

188
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,331
Yes sir. Thank you.

189
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:04,099
uh.. say was it you that fired those shots?

190
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:23,024
Well they're gone.
You want to come out now?

191
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,617
You want a cup of coffee
before you go mountain-climbing?

192
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,728
That would be nice.

193
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,883
[Narrator] The beautiful fugitive's name was Grace.

194
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:52,000
She hadn't chosen Dogville from a map
or sought out the township for a visit,

195
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:56,084
yet Tom felt right away that she belonged.

196
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,737
Shall I take the bone?

197
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,359
[Narrator] She could have kept
her vulnerability to herself,

198
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:11,521
but she had elected to give herself up
to him at random.

199
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,815
As.. yes.. a gift.

200
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:20,900
"Generous, very generous",
thought Tom.

201
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:27,250
You want to eat?
You must be hungry?

202
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:28,669
I can't.

203
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,283
I don't deserve that bread!

204
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:37,910
I stole that bone.
I haven't stolen anything before.

205
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:42,600
So now, now I have to punish myself.

206
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:49,624
I was raised to be arrogant,
so I had to teach myself these things.

207
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:56,472
Well, it may be best for your education...

208
00:15:57,453 --> 00:16:02,549
Grace, in this town in these times...

209
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:07,286
it is very impolite not to eat
what's set before you.

210
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,323
I'm so sorry.

211
00:16:21,957 --> 00:16:25,811
Who were the men in the car?
Why would they want to hurt you?

212
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,936
The man in the back of the car,
he's the boss. I saw his face.

213
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,402
He gave me his telephone number,
told me to call if I saw you.

214
00:16:38,502 --> 00:16:43,040
I'm sure he'd offered you a big reward
if you told him where I was.

215
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,352
Yeah.

216
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,230
Where's your family?

217
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:52,058
I don't have a family.

218
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,635
All I had was a father...

219
00:16:56,095 --> 00:17:00,790
but those gangsters took him away from me.

220
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,224
What if I said you could stay here?

221
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:05,640
Here?

222
00:17:05,673 --> 00:17:08,958
But even if you meant it, it's impossible.

223
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:16,284
It's very small town, I have to hide.
People will ask questions.

224
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:20,817
Well, it might not matter.
Not if they all wanted to help you too.

225
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,792
Are you saying that everybody
in this town is like you?

226
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:29,378
They're good people.
You know, they're honest people.

227
00:17:29,478 --> 00:17:31,801
They've all been in need themselves.

228
00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:34,474
They might well turn you down, but...

229
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:37,996
I think it would be worth the trouble to ask.

230
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,103
But I got nothing to offer them in return.

231
00:17:41,387 --> 00:17:44,868
No, I think you have plenty to offer Dogville.

232
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,000
[Narrator] To call the mood of the audience
at Tom's morale lecture in the mission house the next day,

233
00:17:57,041 --> 00:18:02,061
"enthusiastic" would have been going to far,
but they had come.

234
00:18:02,091 --> 00:18:07,600
And Tom had launched himself fearlessly
into his endeavor to illustrate the human problem:

235
00:18:07,673 --> 00:18:09,602
To receive.

236
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:19,200
The subject was obvious, but quite
dreadfully ill-considered by this young man.

237
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:23,823
To compensate for his lack of preparation
Tom made diligent use of his technique

238
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,977
of lashing out somewhat haphazardly
in all directions.

239
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:32,380
His father peered around covertly
to gauge the mood,

240
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:37,300
and sensing that the assembly was not
entirely happy with this rather direct criticism,

241
00:18:37,344 --> 00:18:40,272
he decided to forestall any protest.

242
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:43,248
Now I'm sure that you wish us well, Tom,

243
00:18:43,527 --> 00:18:48,731
but um.. of any town, I believe this one has
a very fine sense of community.

244
00:18:48,831 --> 00:18:51,478
Living side by side we all know one another.

245
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,400
I'm a pretty fair judge of character myself.

246
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:56,039
Honestly, Tom, you've done it again.

247
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,494
Made us come here to listen
to a lot of nonsense.

248
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:01,600
What do you think you are,
some kind of philosopher?

249
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:03,400
Observant, that's what I am.

250
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:07,212
Lazy, I would say.
We shovel snow together.

251
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,934
We shovel snow together?

252
00:19:08,964 --> 00:19:09,723
Yeah.

253
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,550
Every household clears their own front walk.

254
00:19:12,587 --> 00:19:17,241
Yeah, I gotta allow that Tom's right on that.
If roads don't get 
cleared properly...

255
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,550
I'm sorry Tom, you're going to have to
come up with something better than that.

256
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:28,000
But the whole country would be better served
with a greater attitude of openness and accenpance.

257
00:19:28,074 --> 00:19:31,300
You're suggesting that we all
wouldn't help out if someone needed help.

258
00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:32,950
No, that's not the point.
That's not the point.

259
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:34,241
We care for human beings up here.

260
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,355
We would probably never find out.

261
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:45,664
Since nobody seems to want to admit
that there's a problem,

262
00:19:46,973 --> 00:19:49,124
let me illustrate.

263
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:54,354
Now I'm not going to use something
that's already happened.

264
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:59,065
I'm going to use something
that's just about to happen.

265
00:20:02,397 --> 00:20:08,395
[Narrator] And, after providing a quick summary
of the events of the previous evening
to the astonished people of Dogville,

266
00:20:08,495 --> 00:20:14,253
Tom went down to the mine to retrieve
the fugitive from her hideaway.

267
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:27,591
Allow me to introduce Grace.
Grace, these are the citizens of Dogville.

268
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:30,047
- Hello.
- Hello.

269
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,976
Tom has told us about your predicament, Miss.

270
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:38,700
I really don't want to put any of you
in jeopardy.

271
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:40,400
Why don't you just go to the police?

272
00:20:40,444 --> 00:20:44,000
They can take care of gangsters!
It's their job.

273
00:20:44,018 --> 00:20:48,750
I, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
The transportation 
business would uh...

274
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,326
Ben!

275
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:57,903
These men, they have powerful connections,
even with the police.

276
00:20:58,003 --> 00:21:00,850
Do you think we should give
sanctuary to a fugitive?

277
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,800
A fugitive that gangsters wanna get a hold of.
That would put us in pretty pickle.

278
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:07,500
Easy, Claire...
think of your asthma.

279
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:10,200
Dogville is a good place to hide,
that's for certain.

280
00:21:10,273 --> 00:21:13,102
Exactly.
The only way up here is Canyon Road.

281
00:21:13,604 --> 00:21:20,003
That could easily be watched by Ma Ginger's
-excuse me-nosey cousin who lives
only yards from the turn off.

282
00:21:20,103 --> 00:21:23,000
She has a telephone.
Martha, you could ring the bell,

283
00:21:23,043 --> 00:21:25,413
tell the town if people were coming.

284
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:31,400
But Tom, I chime the hours,
what if people get confused with all the ringing?

285
00:21:31,492 --> 00:21:35,600
Come now, Martha.
Surely we can use our old bell to save a life, if need be.

286
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,935
Why should we?

287
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,379
Because we care, Chuck.
We care for other human beings.

288
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,895
No, that ain't what I mean.

289
00:21:43,284 --> 00:21:46,200
How do we know that this woman is
telling us the truth?

290
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:50,915
Maybe these gangsters did shoot at her,
but that don't make her somebody to be trusted.

291
00:21:51,015 --> 00:21:56,069
He is right.
Why would you trust me?

292
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,150
I trust you!

293
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:01,050
Tom, we're not gangsters.

294
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:06,199
We mind our own business
we don't ask nothin' from nobody.

295
00:22:07,422 --> 00:22:08,900
So at last you admit it!

296
00:22:08,964 --> 00:22:14,000
If only there were some way,
we wouldn't doubt the young lady's word.

297
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,420
some way to know her..

298
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:17,723
Then I think we would all ignore the risk.

299
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:21,545
But there is a way!
You said it yourself.

300
00:22:21,653 --> 00:22:24,343
By living side by side with her.

301
00:22:24,954 --> 00:22:27,449
Dad, you are such a fine judge of character.

302
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:30,801
How long would it take a good man
like you to unmask her?

303
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:34,471
A week? Maybe two?

304
00:22:34,701 --> 00:22:37,026
Surely we can offer her two weeks.

305
00:22:38,162 --> 00:22:41,757
And if after that time so much as
one man cries out 'BE GONE!'

306
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,531
I promise I'll happily send her
packing herself.

307
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:57,150
Well, if Master Tom thinks this is right
for us, and for the 
community,

308
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:03,510
then that will do for me.
He might be young, but his heart is right.

309
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:07,130
And I've known his heart
for as long las it's been beating.

310
00:23:16,202 --> 00:23:20,000
[Narrator] No more words were spoken
at the town meeting in the mission house.

311
00:23:20,072 --> 00:23:25,938
But it had been decided, they all felt,
that the fugitive would be given two weeks.

312
00:23:26,112 --> 00:23:29,200
And they would all be able to look
at themselves in the mirror and know

313
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:35,609
that they had done what they could, indeed,
and perhaps more than most people would have done.

314
00:23:37,723 --> 00:23:46,100
So that very afternoon Tom took Grace on a stroll
down Elm Street to introduce her to the town "he loved".

315
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:50,700
Well, this is where Olivia and June live.

316
00:23:50,712 --> 00:23:56,418
June is a cripple...
They live here as a token of my dad's broadmindedness.

317
00:23:56,586 --> 00:24:00,282
Chuck and Vera have seven children
and they hate each other.

318
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:08,600
Next door we have the Hensons.
They make a living from grinding edges off
cheap glasses to try to make them look expensive.

319
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:13,800
And here we have Jack McKay.
Now, Jack McKay is blind and the whole town knows it.

320
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:18,400
But he thinks he can hide it
by never leaving his house.

321
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,785
In the old stable Ben keeps his truck.

322
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:27,407
He drinks and he visits the whorehouse
once a month and he is ashamed of it.

323
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:34,000
Martha she runs the mission house
until the new preacher comes which will just never happen.

324
00:24:34,845 --> 00:24:41,200
That leaves Ma Ginger and Gloria.
They run this really expensive store,

325
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:45,295
where they exploit the fact
that nobody leaves town.

326
00:24:45,768 --> 00:24:49,934
Used to leave to go vote,
but since they put on the registration fee,

327
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:56,610
about a day's wage for these people,
they don't feel the democratic need any more.

328
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,250
Those awful figurines say more about
the people in this town, than many words.

329
00:25:04,276 --> 00:25:08,591
If this is the town that you love,
then you really have a strange way of showing it.

330
00:25:10,068 --> 00:25:19,328
All I see, is a beautiful little town
in the midst of magnificent mountains.

331
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:28,279
A place where people have hopes
and dreams even under the hardest conditions.

332
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,440
And seven figurines that are not awful at all.

333
00:25:36,342 --> 00:25:39,941
[Narrator] Calling Dogville beautiful was
original at least.

334
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:47,736
Grace was just casting one more look
at the figurines she herself would have dismissed
as tasteless a few days earlier,

335
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:56,504
when she suddenly sensed
what would best have been described
as a tiny change of light over Dogville.

336
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:19,782
They are keeping an eye on you.

337
00:26:19,804 --> 00:26:24,702
If you love them already,
they might need a little persuading.

338
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,355
You've got two weeks
to get them to accept you.

339
00:26:29,747 --> 00:26:32,514
You make it sound like
we are playing a game.

340
00:26:33,255 --> 00:26:40,853
It is. We are. Isn't saving your life
worth a little game?

341
00:26:40,987 --> 00:26:42,732
What do you want me to do?

342
00:26:42,888 --> 00:26:44,770
Do you mind physical labour?

343
00:26:45,007 --> 00:26:46,873
No!

344
00:26:47,904 --> 00:26:50,968
Dogville has offered you two weeks.

345
00:26:52,307 --> 00:26:54,421
now you offer them...

346
00:27:08,874 --> 00:27:12,300
[Narrator] The next day was
a beautiful day in Dogville.

347
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:16,341
The tender leaves on Ma Ginger's
goosberry bushes were unfurling

348
00:27:16,371 --> 00:27:21,015
despite wise Tom's misgivings
as regards her gardening methods.

349
00:27:21,322 --> 00:27:29,634
But more than that, this first day of spring
had also benn picked to be Grace's first ever day of work.

350
00:27:29,734 --> 00:27:36,700
The day in which she was to set off around
Dogville and ofeer herself one hour per household per day.

351
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,907
Excuse me.

352
00:27:41,021 --> 00:27:45,807
I would like to offer you my help..
if there is anything that you need?

353
00:27:47,144 --> 00:27:51,603
Yeah.. A carburetor that don't leak..

354
00:27:53,627 --> 00:27:56,537
alright here, let me take that.

355
00:27:56,774 --> 00:27:59,027
Maybe I could help around your home?

356
00:28:00,153 --> 00:28:06,572
I don't really have a home.
Just the garage.

357
00:28:08,857 --> 00:28:11,610
I'm in the freight business.
The road is my home!

358
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,600
I'm ready. Good morning!

359
00:28:13,631 --> 00:28:15,508
Miss Olivia has got a home.

360
00:28:16,185 --> 00:28:19,792
She is looking to help out
in somebody's home.

361
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:22,244
A cleanin' lady for a cleanin' lady?

362
00:28:22,914 --> 00:28:25,963
You be talkin' nonsense, Mister Ben!

363
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,300
Have a good day!

364
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:30,531
Alright. See ya later on!

365
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:35,100
[Narrator] And off Ben went to Georgetown
with the weekly shipment of glasses

366
00:28:35,123 --> 00:28:41,584
that Mr. Henson had so laboriously cleansed
with his polisher of any trace of their cheap manufacture.

367
00:28:45,714 --> 00:28:51,588
So Grace turned into the alley
which went by the exotic name, Glunen Street

368
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:57,501
to knock on the door of the blind,
but only too vain, man.

369
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,254
Yes?

370
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:04,733
Good morning, Mr. McKay.
My name is Grace.

371
00:29:04,928 --> 00:29:09,061
I was wondering if there is anything
I can do for you?

372
00:29:09,804 --> 00:29:12,400
Oh, that's very kind of you, Grace,
but...

373
00:29:12,462 --> 00:29:16,934
I was thinking that perhaps because of
the situation that you are in...

374
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:19,859
What situation am I in?

375
00:29:21,044 --> 00:29:27,595
Hmm... You are.. on your own.

376
00:29:29,385 --> 00:29:34,311
Oh, I have been on my own for so long.

377
00:29:34,934 --> 00:29:37,178
Anything that you might need?

378
00:29:38,645 --> 00:29:40,300
I'm sorry!

379
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:46,300
Have you ever noticed the wooden spire
on the roof of the mission house?

380
00:29:46,338 --> 00:29:53,400
At 5 o'clock in the afternoon, it points
a shadow at Ginger's grocery store,

381
00:29:53,428 --> 00:30:00,588
right at the O in OPEN
on the sign in the window.

382
00:30:01,692 --> 00:30:05,197
Maybe it is telling people that it is time
to go shopping for supper.

383
00:30:06,378 --> 00:30:08,771
Goodbye, Mr. McKay.

384
00:30:09,992 --> 00:30:11,614
Bye, Grace!

385
00:30:11,948 --> 00:30:17,466
[Narrator] Grace's interview with Jack McKay
proved sadly 
symptomatic of the attitude in Dogville.

386
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:22,863
Reserved but friendly,
not without curiosity.

387
00:30:24,427 --> 00:30:29,016
Only Jack had expressed his "no"
consicely and precisely:

388
00:30:29,216 --> 00:30:34,308
Martha needed a monologue almost
an hour long to arrive at the same conclusion.

389
00:30:34,358 --> 00:30:37,850
Oh my goodness... I, I, I'd have to think of
work for you to do,

390
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:40,233
because I have barely enough work myself.

391
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:45,539
[Narrator] So not very much later Grace had
ended up next to Ma Ginger's gooseberry bushes

392
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,163
in a mood that was not particularly good.

393
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:53,509
She could not tell a gooseberry bush
from a cactus,

394
00:30:53,609 --> 00:30:57,120
but the meticulous order in the yard
appealed to her,

395
00:30:57,384 --> 00:31:01,508
such as the metal chains placed there
in order to shield the second and third bushes,

396
00:31:01,607 --> 00:31:07,830
lest anybody decided to make use of
the deplorably time-honored shortcut to the old lady's bency.

397
00:31:08,574 --> 00:31:13,366
Grace pulled herself together and
headed towards the store.

398
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,364
Hello!

399
00:31:18,517 --> 00:31:23,747
Hello. We don't need any help here either.
I told that to Tom.

400
00:31:23,774 --> 00:31:28,068
Wow, it doesn't matter anyway,
because there is nothing I can do.

401
00:31:28,245 --> 00:31:30,645
I have never worked a day in my life, so.

402
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:39,135
You know, if you put some aloe on
those hands of yours they'll be better by morning.

403
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:42,657
It's the wood shavings.
I really do hate them.

404
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:46,300
But I do believe I'll take your advice.

405
00:31:46,383 --> 00:31:49,690
Your hands are surely the most
alabaster hands I've ever seen.

406
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:52,887
Here comes Tom, how lucky we are.

407
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:58,832
Hi, all. Grace.. how is all going?

408
00:31:59,012 --> 00:32:01,200
- Not very well, I'm afraid.
- Really?

409
00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:03,252
No. Nobody needs any help.

410
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,657
Well, I thought that might be the case.

411
00:32:05,748 --> 00:32:10,791
His plan to make everybody like me
has run into a few problems

412
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:13,100
because nobody wants me to work for them.

413
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,098
I would really like to offer something in return.

414
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:20,148
You're all running a terrible risk
having me here.

415
00:32:21,365 --> 00:32:23,300
I mean, I am willing to learn.

416
00:32:23,357 --> 00:32:27,800
There must be someone who needs help.
Mr. McKay's sight is not good.

417
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:32,200
Yes, I went to Mr. McKay.
I went to Martha and to Chuck and Vera's,

418
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,733
and nobody seems to need any help.

419
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:37,700
They all think everyone else needs
something, and not themselves.

420
00:32:37,728 --> 00:32:41,600
Funny, that's exactly what Tom said.
I supposed he's pleased.

421
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:48,470
Just to prove him wrong,
maybe you can lend a hand here.

422
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,300
But Ginger, there really isn't anything
we need done.

423
00:32:52,372 --> 00:32:54,556
Perhaps there's something
you don't need done?

424
00:32:55,088 --> 00:32:56,700
Anything we don't need done?

425
00:32:56,761 --> 00:33:02,458
Something.. something that you would like
done, but that you don't think is necessay.

426
00:33:02,602 --> 00:33:04,500
What on earth would that be?

427
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:06,744
Maybe... maybe the gooseberry bushes.

428
00:33:06,794 --> 00:33:09,200
The gooseberries are just fine,
thank you very much.

429
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:13,324
No. Not yours. The ones that planted
themselves in the tall grass.

430
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,400
We don't grow anything there.

431
00:33:15,434 --> 00:33:18,987
Exactly. A bit of tiding up.

432
00:33:19,318 --> 00:33:23,200
Who knows, those bushes might
one day bear fruit.

433
00:33:23,275 --> 00:33:26,200
Yeah. That's true! Who knows..

434
00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:27,898
All right, girl.

435
00:33:29,014 --> 00:33:35,694
Those alabaster hands of yours are
hereby engaged to weed the wild gooseberry bushes.

436
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,004
Thank you!

437
00:33:39,462 --> 00:33:42,148
Around.. like this, you see.

438
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:46,174
Anything to close them...
just be careful, that's all.

439
00:33:47,906 --> 00:33:51,790
[Narrator] After a few of the wild little
gooseberry bushes had given up the ghost

440
00:33:51,803 --> 00:33:56,171
in the care of Grace's as yet
unpracticed alabaster hands,

441
00:33:56,209 --> 00:34:00,781
things began looking up
with the weeding and the town.

442
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:10,109
In fact it turned out there were not so few things
that the other townsfold of Dogville didn't need doing either.

443
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:17,278
As Ben had no home, Grace's domestic
experiments were absolutely things he didn't need,

444
00:34:17,864 --> 00:34:24,300
but he put up with them anyhow,
appearing with astonishing punctuality
when the act of domesticity had been completed,

445
00:34:24,374 --> 00:34:29,366
no matter how unpredictable business
hours in the freight industry might otherwise have been.

446
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:37,500
Olivia didn't need anyone to help June
to the toilet while she was at work,

447
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:43,334
as hitherto they had coped splendidly
with Olivia's excellent diaper arrangement.

448
00:34:44,934 --> 00:34:51,882
If Jack McKay had needed a partner
for conversation he would surely have gone out
and gotten one for himself in the town.

449
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:57,000
So it was not out of need that he allowed
Grace to sit with him in his dark parlor

450
00:34:57,043 --> 00:35:05,232
with the dramatic drapes on one wall
for lengthy discussions regarding
the underestimated qualities of the light on the East Coast.

451
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:12,506
As Martha wouldn't dream of burdening
the parish with wear and tear of the pedals and bellows,

452
00:35:12,558 --> 00:35:18,305
while waiting for the new priest to be appointed,
she practiced without a note ever leaving the organ,

453
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:22,666
and was therefore not really
in need of anyone to turn her pages.

454
00:35:23,744 --> 00:35:29,583
And God knows that Mr. and Mrs. Henson's son
did not need any help with his books,

455
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:34,100
and that the family had taken Grace
for her own sake.

456
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,056
And although Liz's hands had improved
through Grace's good counsel,

457
00:35:43,156 --> 00:35:48,450
Thomas Edison was a doctor and
of indisputable health and he did not need care,

458
00:35:48,573 --> 00:35:52,572
or help with the pills from the medicine
closet with its many secrets.

459
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:01,000
Actually Chuck was the only one
"not yet hooked", as Tom put it.

460
00:36:01,084 --> 00:36:07,139
Hooked? You sound so arrogant!
Arrogance is the worst thing!

461
00:36:07,403 --> 00:36:09,173
He doesn't like me.

462
00:36:10,852 --> 00:36:12,820
And he has every right to feel that way.

463
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:18,740
Yeah. Listen!
Luckily I have prepared a Trojan horse.

464
00:36:19,353 --> 00:36:20,161
A what?

465
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,923
Trojan horse.
We can get in by way of Vera.

466
00:36:23,054 --> 00:36:31,409
There is this.. lecture tomorrow
in Georgetown, given by some professor.

467
00:36:31,509 --> 00:36:35,505
Some intellectual thing.

468
00:36:36,129 --> 00:36:40,367
But not so intellectual he can't tour
the provinces with it, anyway, the point is,

469
00:36:40,683 --> 00:36:45,858
Vera she would do anything to go,
but she's got no one to mind Achilles while she is gone.

470
00:36:46,022 --> 00:36:51,564
She trusts the girls mastering their iambs
and pentameters, but not with the little one.

471
00:36:51,572 --> 00:36:56,720
So this is where you come in.
I said that you could watch him tomorrow afternoon.

472
00:36:56,836 --> 00:37:03,461
Now, I will try and stall her on her way home
and with a bit of luck, Chuck'll get back before she does

473
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:08,036
and you can use the time and
all your charm to try and win him over.

474
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,506
I'll happily mind Achilles if Vera will let me.

475
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:14,881
But if he doesn't like me he doesn't like me.

476
00:37:15,854 --> 00:37:20,756
[Narrator] Tom really was enchanted by this
unusual, mysterious creature.

477
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:26,282
And even though she did not satisfy
his curiosity by saying 
anything about her past

478
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:35,492
so as not to put anyone in danger,
she still fitted Tom's mission to educate Dogville
on the subject of acceptance like a glove.

479
00:37:36,084 --> 00:37:38,066
Tom felt content.

480
00:37:38,073 --> 00:37:43,550
Grace had been dangling over the edge,
and he had been the one to pull her back onto the path.

481
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:49,615
It gave him a fine sensation of mastery,
new for him in terms of the opposite sex,

482
00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:54,301
and his feelings unleashed the best
in his burgeoning love.

483
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:15,740
Hello. This is Dahlia, Olympia, Diana,
Athena, Pandora, Jason, Achilles.

484
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,605
Your children are lovely.

485
00:38:21,705 --> 00:38:28,512
They are good kids. And I love them.

486
00:38:33,703 --> 00:38:38,626
Please don't say any such nice things
about the kids. I cry too easily.

487
00:38:40,491 --> 00:38:43,101
Both in sorrow and in joy.

488
00:38:44,326 --> 00:38:45,929
- Hey, Vera.
- Oh, hi!

489
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,322
- Shall we go?
- I'm ready.

490
00:38:48,684 --> 00:38:50,867
Thanks for leaving the map out.

491
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:54,906
I'd a plum forgot it, I'm sure.
How did you know I was going that far?

492
00:38:55,226 --> 00:38:59,710
The last time I saw the thermos,
it was on the doorstep and the map was beside it,

493
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:04,851
so I just thought, when I saw the thermos
this time and no map, but...

494
00:39:06,796 --> 00:39:09,271
You are a sweet girl, Grace.

495
00:39:09,868 --> 00:39:11,603
Sweet as Miss Laura.

496
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,158
Who's Miss Laura?

497
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,574
You gave yourself again, Ben.

498
00:39:15,616 --> 00:39:20,062
I think Miss Laura is
what Ovid might call a Maenad.

499
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,808
Oh, don't be ashamed, Ben.

500
00:39:27,227 --> 00:39:30,400
We all have the right to make the most of our lives.

501
00:39:30,463 --> 00:39:35,899
I'm sure that those ladies in those houses
they bring a lot of joy to a lot of men.

502
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:42,667
Ain't nothing I'm proud of.
It really ain't.

503
00:39:59,793 --> 00:40:01,854
I know what you are doing here.

504
00:40:03,511 --> 00:40:04,729
You do?

505
00:40:05,827 --> 00:40:10,270
You want people to like you,
so you don't have to go away.

506
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:13,529
You are very smart.

507
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:18,500
Yes, I like it here in Dogville.

508
00:40:18,527 --> 00:40:23,913
Do you want me to read to you?
About the Cyclops?

509
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:27,078
I don't like the Cyclops.

510
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:33,898
Two eyes are pretties, like yours.

511
00:40:38,471 --> 00:40:44,218
If you want my Ma to like you, and let you stay.
You'll just have to be nice to me.

512
00:40:46,942 --> 00:40:49,244
Maybe you should help me clean up instead.

513
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:54,338
Ma says I don't have to work,
'cept in my head.

514
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:58,325
Oh, but what about if I ask you, please?

515
00:40:58,537 --> 00:40:59,426
Ok.

516
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,483
What are you doing here?

517
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:17,000
Didn't I tell you we don't need
no help from you?

518
00:41:17,048 --> 00:41:18,913
Ma asked her to mind me and Achilles.

519
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:22,009
Quiet! Get out! The lot of you.

520
00:41:24,704 --> 00:41:26,389
The same nonsense!

521
00:41:27,056 --> 00:41:29,845
They'd have done just great in Antiquity,
no doubt.

522
00:41:30,923 --> 00:41:34,446
How is it going otherwise,
with the fooling act?

523
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,932
I wasn't trying to fool anyone?

524
00:41:41,302 --> 00:41:44,557
I mean Dogville.
Has it got you fooled yet?

525
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:51,496
I thought you were implying
that I was trying to exploit the town.

526
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,953
Wishful thinking.

527
00:41:55,868 --> 00:41:59,656
This town is rotten from the inside out,

528
00:42:00,172 --> 00:42:02,928
and I wouldn't miss it,
if it fell into the gorge tomorrow.

529
00:42:03,368 --> 00:42:10,647
I see no charm here, but you seem to.

530
00:42:11,104 --> 00:42:14,134
Admit it you've fallen for Dogville.

531
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:19,204
The trees, the mountains,
the simple folk.

532
00:42:19,773 --> 00:42:22,977
And if all that ain't got you fooled yet,
I bet the cinnamon has.

533
00:42:23,437 --> 00:42:26,893
That damned cinnamon
in those gooseberry pies.

534
00:42:27,735 --> 00:42:31,211
Dogville has everything that you ever
dreamed of in the big city.

535
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:36,341
You are worse than Tom.
How do you know what I dreamed of?

536
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:43,500
You're from the city yourself, aren't you?

537
00:42:43,655 --> 00:42:45,385
That was a long time ago.

538
00:42:45,637 --> 00:42:49,100
I am not that stupid anymore,
I found out that people are the same all over.

539
00:42:49,117 --> 00:42:50,654
Greedy as animals.

540
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:54,187
In a small town they're just a bit
less successful.

541
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,940
Feed 'em enough they'll eat
till their bellies burst.

542
00:42:56,953 --> 00:42:59,122
That's why you wanted to get rid of me...

543
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:04,415
because you can't stand that I remind
you of what it was you came here to find.

544
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:14,176
I'm telling you for the last time
to get out of my home.

545
00:43:14,276 --> 00:43:16,372
Moses don't like you.
And I don't like you.

546
00:43:16,822 --> 00:43:19,360
The kids are going crazy enough
from their ma's teachin'.

547
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:21,010
Thank you, Grace!

548
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:43,454
[Narrator] The two seeks had passed far too quickly.
Grace had enjoyed herself.

549
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:47,317
All she could say was that
she was fond of them all,

550
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:51,811
including the folk who had greeted her
with reluctance and hostility.

551
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:57,980
Even though she might not have won everybody
over completely or even half way, as Tom put it,

552
00:43:58,729 --> 00:44:04,640
She cared for Dogville and she had shown
the town her face, her true face.

553
00:44:04,913 --> 00:44:06,997
But was that enough?

554
00:44:07,513 --> 00:44:13,613
During Jack McKay's long lecture that evening
she had found herself in a heart-searching mood.

555
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:17,915
Whether heart-searching or
concern for her future was the cause,

556
00:44:18,015 --> 00:44:26,140
the result was that the otherwise so lovable
Grace indulged in a pretty shady piece of provocation.

557
00:44:26,175 --> 00:44:34,827
So you agree that the windows of St. Bridget's,
at the first time you saw them,
didn't live up to their reputation.

558
00:44:35,524 --> 00:44:41,047
I don't think it is the position of the church itself.

559
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:51,572
Maybe it's the light in Los Angeles and
the mosaic glass in those windows they kind of collide,

560
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,640
I remember thinking that.

561
00:44:57,342 --> 00:45:01,859
I think we've talked long enough about
the way we remembering seeing things.

562
00:45:02,046 --> 00:45:03,200
Don't you?

563
00:45:04,749 --> 00:45:10,519
Why don't we talk about something
that we can see right now?

564
00:45:11,186 --> 00:45:16,577
There is not much to see around here.
Wretched town.

565
00:45:17,844 --> 00:45:19,898
Why don't we talk about the view?

566
00:45:24,086 --> 00:45:32,150
I don't go out much.
The sun and my skin.

567
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:35,312
Yesterday I was walking in Chuck's apple trees.

568
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:43,800
If you go right up to the edge of the cliff
you just manage to peer round Ben's garage

569
00:45:43,811 --> 00:45:47,325
and you get a view of your house
from the side facing the gorge.

570
00:45:48,005 --> 00:45:53,516
I didn't realize that there was windows behind there.

571
00:45:54,306 --> 00:46:00,628
Huge windows.
There must be a wonderful view.

572
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:04,481
Would you mind if I opened them?

573
00:46:44,324 --> 00:46:50,451
You're no fool, Miss Grace.
You're no fool.

574
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:55,900
You probably see that those curtains
are hard to open.

575
00:46:55,994 --> 00:46:57,027
Sorry!

576
00:46:59,785 --> 00:47:06,130
And obviously concluded that it's because
they're not used very often.

577
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:14,557
But the view's good, entrancing even.

578
00:47:18,227 --> 00:47:29,572
So, ask me, why a man who loves the light
hang these heavy curtains?

579
00:47:36,485 --> 00:47:40,713
Yes, I'm blind.

580
00:47:41,164 --> 00:47:48,014
Not weak sighted, not myopic: blind.

581
00:47:50,183 --> 00:48:01,171
So please go
and let me be that on my own.

582
00:48:07,576 --> 00:48:16,412
Is Switzerland they call it the Alpengulen.

583
00:48:17,774 --> 00:48:22,531
That's the light that reflects
from the highest peaks

584
00:48:22,905 --> 00:48:27,805
after the sun goes down behind the mountains.

585
00:48:29,955 --> 00:48:31,733
But now it's gone.

586
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:59,950
[Narrator] It was in complete silence
that the people of Dogville turned up for the meeting
at the mission house

587
00:48:59,981 --> 00:49:03,970
two weeks to the day since the beautiful
fugitive had come to town.

588
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:10,131
Grace was standing beside Tom,
watching them convene,

589
00:49:10,218 --> 00:49:17,127
and knew inside herself that this might well be
the last time she would see these now so familiar faces.

590
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:22,589
She had at least two of them against her,
and even one would have been too many.

591
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:26,500
Welcome good people of Dogville.

592
00:49:26,522 --> 00:49:33,856
Two weeks.... two weeks have passed
and it is time for your verdict.

593
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,997
Is it right that she should be here while we talk?

594
00:49:38,051 --> 00:49:42,160
Well, Mrs. Henson, when Grace first came
she made no attempt to hide her weakness from us.

595
00:49:42,196 --> 00:49:50,051
So I think it is only right we be as open
with her, tell her to her face if we want her to leave.

596
00:49:50,563 --> 00:49:52,592
No, Mrs. Henson is right.

597
00:49:53,004 --> 00:49:57,935
Nobody should be prevented from
speaking their mind out of politeness.

598
00:49:58,947 --> 00:50:00,745
I'll wait at the mine.

599
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:08,040
And if the vote says that I should leave,
then I'll take the path across the mountains, while it's still light.

600
00:50:09,054 --> 00:50:12,783
And the things I've borrowed, if you could,
return them to everybody.

601
00:50:12,904 --> 00:50:13,876
Of course!

602
00:50:13,892 --> 00:50:16,320
Nobody has to see me before I go.

603
00:50:16,766 --> 00:50:20,142
Martha, if you will just ring the bell
then I'll understand.

604
00:50:20,464 --> 00:50:23,363
I don't ... how do...
am I gonna ring the bell?

605
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:27,508
Just ring it for every vote that lets me stay.

606
00:50:27,834 --> 00:50:34,320
I will count. And if it doesn't reach
fifteen, then I'll leave.

607
00:50:42,797 --> 00:50:48,400
Tom is anxious to speak in her behalf,
but I think he's had his allotted time.

608
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,692
We know his view. We respect it.
And now he must respect ours.

609
00:50:54,671 --> 00:50:59,283
[Narrator] Grace pulled her bundle out from
under the bureau to change into her own clothes,

610
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:03,839
only to discover that somebody had been
in it and left a loaf of bread.

611
00:51:05,764 --> 00:51:08,433
Next to it was a folded sheet of paper.

612
00:51:08,576 --> 00:51:11,266
It was a map Tom had drawn.

613
00:51:11,286 --> 00:51:14,800
He had known where the bundle was
and had put it there.

614
00:51:14,852 --> 00:51:17,100
It showed the path across the mountain.

615
00:51:17,149 --> 00:51:22,312
And all the dangerous spots were
furnished with witty horrific little sketches.

616
00:51:23,948 --> 00:51:25,661
But there was more.

617
00:51:25,761 --> 00:51:32,000
Several people had the same idea.
They had eased gifts into the bundle for her.

618
00:51:32,052 --> 00:51:36,709
Jason's beloved little penknife lay there,
all polished and shiny.

619
00:51:36,785 --> 00:51:42,683
And a pie from Ma Ginger and Gloria.
And some clothing and matches, and a hymnal.

620
00:51:43,029 --> 00:51:48,251
Grace opened it at number 18, where Martha
always had trouble with fingering.

621
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:56,051
And between the pages lay a dollar bill
Martha alone could not have afforded it.

622
00:51:56,701 --> 00:52:01,200
Grace had friends in Dogville.
That was for sure.

623
00:52:01,222 --> 00:52:04,865
Whether they were few or many did not matter a jot.

624
00:52:05,065 --> 00:52:10,200
Grace had bared her throat to the town
and it had responded with a great gift:

625
00:52:10,617 --> 00:52:12,474
with friends.

626
00:52:17,541 --> 00:52:23,301
No gangster could deprive her of this
meeting with the township,
no matter how many guns in the world.

627
00:52:23,803 --> 00:52:29,421
And should the strokes of the bell did not reach 15,
she knew now that she meant something to the town

628
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:32,554
and that her stay had been of significance.

629
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:37,736
Not much, perhaps, but nevertheless,
a trace she had left.

630
00:52:38,597 --> 00:52:42,359
And the first in her young life
in which she took pride.

631
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:59,366
Grace stiffened as the bell began its toll.

632
00:53:41,877 --> 00:53:45,104
Fourteen. Grace counted.

633
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:53,158
So McKay must have voted for her after all,
and if so, why not Chuck, too?

634
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:34,893
Everyone?

635
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:37,955
- Chuck!
- Chuck!

636
00:54:38,295 --> 00:54:39,767
Everyone.

637
00:54:41,056 --> 00:54:43,588
I think they like you here.

638
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:06,202
[Narrator] The period of spring and early summer
proved a happy one for Grace.

639
00:55:06,715 --> 00:55:09,849
Martha rang the hours,
conducting her through the day.

640
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:14,647
So she could serve as eyes for McKay,
a mother for Ben,

641
00:55:15,588 --> 00:55:20,578
friend for Vera,
and brains for Bill...

642
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:35,980
And one day it had occurred to Grace
to tread the pedals herself so to get Martha to agree

643
00:55:35,994 --> 00:55:39,233
to play a couple of paper notes,
just to empty the bellows naturally

644
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:43,239
so that they wouldn't be left under pressure
and thus be spoiled.

645
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:49,300
And now they had tacitly agreed that
as long as it was Grace who trode the pedals,

646
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:52,349
Martha could play without feeling any guilt.

647
00:55:56,497 --> 00:56:01,586
To Tom's pop, the old doctor, who imagined
he had a new ailment every single day

648
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:06,674
and was thus increasingly addicted to
the simpler coordination tests
from his medical school days,

649
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:11,325
she had to be severe, telling him that
there was nothing wrong with him.

650
00:56:14,046 --> 00:56:18,672
And now, since the town had agreed that
everyone was to give according to his abilities

651
00:56:18,732 --> 00:56:24,600
she received wages, not much, but enough
to save up for the first of the tiny china figurines

652
00:56:24,613 --> 00:56:29,788
from the row of seven that had stood
for so long gathering dust in the window of the store.

653
00:56:30,961 --> 00:56:35,623
And she dreamed that in time she would
be able to acquire them all.

654
00:56:38,476 --> 00:56:46,136
Slowly those alabaster hands turned
into a pair of hands that could have belonged to
anyone in any little rural community.

655
00:56:47,281 --> 00:56:53,550
And three weeks later she triumphantly
moved into a place Tom and Ben had secretly restored,

656
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:58,428
namely the old mill, which had once held
the town's ore crusher,

657
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:02,545
but of which only the heavy
flywheel now remained.

658
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:10,257
Thanks.

659
00:57:10,526 --> 00:57:13,195
That's what I am talking about
with the freight industry.

660
00:57:13,953 --> 00:57:17,178
Miss Laura had thrown that out,
it was no use to anybody.

661
00:57:18,412 --> 00:57:22,608
A good thing, in the wrong place.
But with my truck... You know.

662
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:25,220
You shouldn't poke fun at
the freight industry, that's all.

663
00:57:26,511 --> 00:57:29,390
No, you're right, Ben.
They shouldn't.

664
00:57:35,595 --> 00:57:36,619
Grace!

665
00:57:38,604 --> 00:57:39,403
What?

666
00:57:40,147 --> 00:57:44,750
I just had to tell you that I had a really
selfish reason for voting to keep you in Dogville.

667
00:57:49,111 --> 00:57:50,258
What was it?

668
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:57,192
It was such a relief when you turned up
and you were the one all the men had eyes for.

669
00:57:57,723 --> 00:58:03,100
You know, Tom and them.
I've had to put up with it for so long..

670
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:07,175
Frankly, I just didn't have
the energy for it anymore.

671
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:09,801
They'll always have eyes for you, Liz.

672
00:58:11,243 --> 00:58:17,413
You know that.. They will.
You are beautiful.

673
00:58:17,463 --> 00:58:18,324
Thank you.

674
00:58:19,903 --> 00:58:23,939
[Narrator] The very latest development,
now that summer was at its peak,

675
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:27,597
was that Grace had been given leave
to help Chuck in the orchard.

676
00:58:28,315 --> 00:58:34,975
And every day at 5, once their work was done,
she could appreciate that actually McKay was right;

677
00:58:34,992 --> 00:58:40,406
the shadow of the spire did indeed
point at Ma Ginger's store.

678
00:58:44,029 --> 00:58:48,962
But today the tower did not only announce
that it was time to go shopping but also,

679
00:58:48,995 --> 00:58:55,386
by a signal which nobody despite Martha's
initial concern could have confused with the ringing of the hours,

680
00:58:55,617 --> 00:59:00,654
a warning that somebody was approaching
via Canyon Road from Georgetown.

681
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:06,376
For the first time in living memory
law enforcers had come to Dogville!

682
00:59:15,091 --> 00:59:16,354
Evenin' sir.

683
00:59:18,683 --> 00:59:20,853
Is this the whole place?

684
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:24,445
- There's a town hall?
- No.

685
00:59:24,688 --> 00:59:26,486
I got me a notice to paste up.

686
00:59:26,586 --> 00:59:29,446
We got the mission house.
That do you?

687
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:30,987
Sure.

688
00:59:32,011 --> 00:59:33,150
What'd she do?

689
00:59:33,725 --> 00:59:38,623
Missing! That's all it says.
I guess somebody's been missing her.

690
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:41,264
Heard tell she was last seen around here.

691
00:59:42,069 --> 00:59:44,308
We've putting these things
all over the county.

692
00:59:45,405 --> 00:59:47,374
And if somebody sees her,
they ought to go to the police?

693
00:59:48,063 --> 00:59:49,928
I guess that's the idea.

694
01:00:20,622 --> 01:00:23,095
These men were never gonna give in easily.

695
01:00:24,012 --> 01:00:28,297
Now these posters they hang
all over in the county.

696
01:00:29,843 --> 01:00:32,600
which means nobody suspects
she's right here with us.

697
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:36,390
But it was a policeman, Tom.
Isn't it a duty to respond to the police?

698
01:00:36,416 --> 01:00:44,389
I mean, legally speaking.
I'm sorry, I just.. when I get upset.

699
01:00:44,993 --> 01:00:48,651
She's just a missing person.
She hasn't done anything. He even said so.

700
01:00:48,682 --> 01:00:50,220
I think you should vote again.

701
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:55,615
Why? We can't resort to plebiscites
time and time again.

702
01:00:56,804 --> 01:01:03,155
Come on. Who's really got cold feet
because of her picture on a piece of paper?

703
01:01:25,218 --> 01:01:34,216
[Narrator] The 4th of July came with the huge
clouds of seeds from some remote meadow
gracefully floating down Elm Street in the early evening.

704
01:01:34,416 --> 01:01:39,931
Today was a day for celebration.
Nobody was to worry about the hard times.

705
01:01:40,031 --> 01:01:43,496
And Grace could stop at Ma Ginger's
window quite content:

706
01:01:43,845 --> 01:01:49,270
to ascertain that only two of the little china
figurines remained, and were thus the only two

707
01:01:49,277 --> 01:01:52,787
she had not yet been able to
save up enough to purchase.

708
01:01:57,025 --> 01:01:58,833
- It looks great, girls..
- Uh-huh..

709
01:02:00,942 --> 01:02:05,326
Grace, could you put in a couple of hours
with me in the orchard again today?

710
01:02:05,684 --> 01:02:08,340
It's really nice down there with the sunshine!

711
01:02:08,469 --> 01:02:13,855
Chuck, it's the fourth of July!
What are you talking about sunshine for?

712
01:02:15,004 --> 01:02:17,838
Have you turned into a romantic like me?

713
01:02:21,731 --> 01:02:23,212
We're gonna have fun.

714
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,373
And in the winter we'll all starve...

715
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:29,788
Even Ben's taking the day off.

716
01:02:31,388 --> 01:02:33,296
- Hi!
- Hi, Tom!

717
01:02:33,526 --> 01:02:35,308
Grace, you've got a moment?

718
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:38,524
Now?

719
01:02:39,621 --> 01:02:43,043
Yeah. I've got something
interesting to tell you.

720
01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:46,778
Well, it has to be quick.

721
01:02:54,142 --> 01:02:56,300
I've got so much going on in my head...

722
01:02:57,698 --> 01:03:00,250
That must be very tiring for you!

723
01:03:01,379 --> 01:03:04,577
I think I've done a pretty good analysis
of the folks in this town

724
01:03:07,759 --> 01:03:13,513
and I think I understand them
in a meaningful way.

725
01:03:15,613 --> 01:03:21,110
But when I come to decipher you,
I get absolutely nowhere.

726
01:03:21,414 --> 01:03:25,863
You know Liz...
Liz is easy to read.

727
01:03:28,714 --> 01:03:31,444
And there was some attraction between us,

728
01:03:34,248 --> 01:03:36,627
but as I can see right through her,

729
01:03:37,384 --> 01:03:40,539
intellectually I mean, I can see right through her,

730
01:03:40,768 --> 01:03:48,097
my desire is purely of a physical nature.

731
01:03:50,539 --> 01:03:58,030
But with you, it's more...
it's more complicated.

732
01:03:58,058 --> 01:03:59,874
What are you trying to say?

733
01:04:03,066 --> 01:04:05,601
No, I should get it clear in my head first.

734
01:04:07,993 --> 01:04:10,466
Are you trying to say that ...

735
01:04:12,507 --> 01:04:14,689
you're in love with me?

736
01:04:16,469 --> 01:04:27,535
No, I wouldn't.. love is...
It's not... It's a big word...

737
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:28,227
Yeah.

738
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:33,789
Yeah.

739
01:04:35,823 --> 01:04:37,135
That's good!

740
01:04:40,904 --> 01:04:42,167
because ...

741
01:04:46,037 --> 01:04:49,239
I think that I am in love with you, too.

742
01:04:50,805 --> 01:04:52,748
Very interesting, isn't it?

743
01:04:54,571 --> 01:04:58,480
I mean it's interesting in a psychological...

744
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:08,774
Did they call you?
I think they are calling you.

745
01:05:11,743 --> 01:05:13,576
I didn't hear them.

746
01:05:16,876 --> 01:05:17,993
No.

747
01:05:21,047 --> 01:05:25,000
You should probably get back anyway.

748
01:05:27,789 --> 01:05:31,094
I will see you at the wedding.
Next celebration..

749
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:08,463
This year I didn't bring any notes with me.

750
01:06:08,851 --> 01:06:11,781
Because I'm not gonna pretend
I can read them.

751
01:06:13,572 --> 01:06:17,292
Which brings me to a point.
A point I wanna make.

752
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:21,914
And that point is you, Grace.

753
01:06:22,835 --> 01:06:29,285
Yes. You have made Dogville
a wonderful place to live in.

754
01:06:30,002 --> 01:06:36,253
As a matter of fact, somebody tells me
they ran into grumpy old Chuck down the street

755
01:06:36,513 --> 01:06:38,612
and he was actually smiling.

756
01:06:40,445 --> 01:06:47,021
Well, I've never seen your smile, Grace,
but I will bet you I could describe it.

757
01:06:48,965 --> 01:06:56,906
Because it obviously has every color
that's reflected from the shiniest prism in the world.

758
01:06:57,713 --> 01:07:01,545
You probably have a face to match that.
Does she have a face to match that, Tom?

759
01:07:01,645 --> 01:07:03,712
- Yes, sir.
- Hmm..?
- Yes, sir.

760
01:07:03,812 --> 01:07:08,194
I bet she does.
We are proud to have you among us.

761
01:07:09,387 --> 01:07:15,349
And we thank you for
showing us who you are.

762
01:07:15,971 --> 01:07:17,806
Here to you, Grace.

763
01:07:18,613 --> 01:07:21,109
Stay with us as long as you damn please.

764
01:07:43,865 --> 01:07:48,111
A police car has just been seen in town and
it has just made the turn up Canyon Road!

765
01:07:48,756 --> 01:07:49,872
So he will be here any minute.

766
01:07:50,209 --> 01:07:51,546
Shall I ring the bell?

767
01:07:52,471 --> 01:07:55,296
No, Martha.
Grace probably heard.

768
01:07:56,547 --> 01:07:58,051
We'll get rid of 'em quickly.

769
01:07:59,182 --> 01:08:00,230
Don't worry.

770
01:08:13,357 --> 01:08:16,545
Should have been celebrating myself,
if this hadn't come up.

771
01:08:17,282 --> 01:08:19,805
Have to change this missing person notice.

772
01:08:21,094 --> 01:08:22,789
It's that lady again.

773
01:08:24,265 --> 01:08:25,965
That's why she disappeared.

774
01:08:27,969 --> 01:08:31,855
She's wanted in connection with some
bank robberies on the West Coast.

775
01:08:32,535 --> 01:08:34,815
When did these robberies take place?

776
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:36,746
Last couple of weeks.

777
01:08:38,092 --> 01:08:40,254
You don't get much news up here,
do you?

778
01:08:40,354 --> 01:08:42,795
My dad's radio only plays music.

779
01:08:44,932 --> 01:08:47,684
Well, all know is that they say she's dangerous,

780
01:08:47,865 --> 01:08:52,109
and that anyone with any information
about her had better call us pronto.

781
01:08:52,516 --> 01:08:53,910
That's the law.

782
01:09:08,815 --> 01:09:13,530
Two weeks!
Can't be our girl, Tom.

783
01:09:13,944 --> 01:09:15,874
No, she's been here all the time.

784
01:09:15,898 --> 01:09:16,724
Right!

785
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:19,068
She couldn't have done
what they are accusing her of.

786
01:09:20,243 --> 01:09:21,931
No, that's true, Tom, 
you are right.

787
01:09:22,155 --> 01:09:25,020
Still it's an unpleasant business
just the same.

788
01:09:32,212 --> 01:09:35,268
[Narrator] Grace was the same
and so was the town.

789
01:09:36,021 --> 01:09:43,307
That the gangsters had fixed to have
charges made against Grace in their effort
to neuralize her came as no surprise.

790
01:09:44,515 --> 01:09:47,700
But everything had changed a little
yet again.

791
01:09:47,762 --> 01:09:54,320
I'm telling you, you have exactly the same
kind of little lump in exactly the same spot
on the other side of your back.

792
01:09:54,341 --> 01:09:55,109
Really!

793
01:09:55,130 --> 01:10:05,263
I can only assume that it belongs
on your body, but you're the doctor, so...

794
01:10:05,637 --> 01:10:11,712
Well, it's very unlikely, don't you think?
that a cancer would develop in such precise symmetry.

795
01:10:11,733 --> 01:10:17,323
- Mr. Edison, please. We've been
over this so many times.
- Anything is possible.

796
01:10:17,368 --> 01:10:24,647
I think you have to accept the fact
that you are an exceptionally healthy elderly gentleman.

797
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:27,472
I'm gonna rest just the same.

798
01:10:27,572 --> 01:10:28,975
I'll see you in the morning.

799
01:10:29,385 --> 01:10:30,683
I hope so.

800
01:10:31,251 --> 01:10:33,474
What? What did they say?

801
01:10:33,689 --> 01:10:40,484
Well, they couldn't really argue
that anything had changed.

802
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:45,461
But by not telling the police they felt
they were committing a crime themselves.

803
01:10:49,043 --> 01:10:50,831
- I think I should leave.
- No..

804
01:10:50,933 --> 01:10:52,184
Enough is enough.

805
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:53,991
I suggested the opposite.

806
01:10:54,999 --> 01:10:56,071
You did?

807
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:59,928
From a business perspective, ...

808
01:11:01,289 --> 01:11:07,436
from a business perspective,
your presence in Dogville has become more costly.

809
01:11:08,119 --> 01:11:11,425
Because it's more dangerous
for them to have you here,

810
01:11:11,589 --> 01:11:13,732
not that they don't want you,

811
01:11:14,402 --> 01:11:19,684
since they feel there should be
some counterbalance,

812
01:11:20,532 --> 01:11:22,460
some quid pro quo.

813
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:25,294
That sound like words
that the gangsters would use...

814
01:11:25,494 --> 01:11:30,123
There is also more of an incentive
if you don't wanna stay.

815
01:11:32,062 --> 01:11:38,735
See, with all those wanted posters
hanging around the place, I can hardly
think of anywhere else you could hide.

816
01:11:40,734 --> 01:11:43,587
So what's the counterbalance
that you suggested?

817
01:11:47,194 --> 01:11:53,240
They wanted you to work longer hours,
but instead what I proposed is

818
01:11:53,256 --> 01:11:58,742
that you just pay a visit to folks
twice a day now.

819
01:11:58,864 --> 01:12:05,128
That way it would seem that you're willing
to contribute more, without actually
lengthening your day too much.

820
01:12:05,228 --> 01:12:08,095
It's just a way of heading off
any unpleasantness.

821
01:12:13,297 --> 01:12:20,000
Well, it sounds a little peculiar
and difficult to put into practice.

822
01:12:20,011 --> 01:12:21,906
That's what I thought.

823
01:12:22,328 --> 01:12:25,697
Martha she said she would ring
her bell every half hour,

824
01:12:25,774 --> 01:12:28,755
so you could keep track of
your new schedule.

825
01:12:31,525 --> 01:12:33,230
Then, they are all willing to let me stay?

826
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:40,742
No. See, Mrs. Henson she also
thought we should cut your pay.

827
01:12:41,229 --> 01:12:49,564
Merely a symbolic gesture. You see...
the word dangerous on that poster worried her.

828
01:12:51,488 --> 01:12:58,000
I'm willing to do whatever it takes.
If I have to work harder, longer hours for less pay,

829
01:12:58,027 --> 01:13:01,036
then I'm willing to do that.
Of course, I am.

830
01:13:02,734 --> 01:13:07,672
I just wanna be sure that they
wouldn't prefer that I left town.

831
01:13:07,702 --> 01:13:09,162
Of course not.

832
01:13:11,628 --> 01:13:13,826
You think this is for the best?

833
01:13:14,689 --> 01:13:16,460
I know it is.

834
01:13:19,787 --> 01:13:27,720
I have to get some sleep. My days are
gonna be much busier now.

835
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:29,039
Sorry.

836
01:13:52,588 --> 01:13:58,865
Tom, I just need to know something...

837
01:14:01,383 --> 01:14:04,874
you know the card that the man
in the car gave you...

838
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:05,943
Yeah.

839
01:14:11,653 --> 01:14:13,798
Did you show it to anyone?

840
01:14:14,463 --> 01:14:18,983
Come on, Grace!
I burned it first thing.

841
01:14:19,472 --> 01:14:22,932
I've been so silly.
Of course you did.

842
01:14:22,972 --> 01:14:24,365
It's alright.

843
01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:29,600
No, it's not alright. I hate it
for you to see me like this.

844
01:14:29,654 --> 01:14:31,843
I can't bare that I'm doubting you.

845
01:14:32,235 --> 01:14:34,892
I'm sorry.
Good night.

846
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:58,900
[Narrator] Everybody was really against
any changes to Grace's working conditions at all

847
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:01,779
when the subjuct occasionally
came up in conversation.

848
01:15:09,412 --> 01:15:13,574
Oh, Ben had declared in sympathy that
he wouldn't accept any more work than before,

849
01:15:13,674 --> 01:15:15,605
and Grace was grateful for that,

850
01:15:16,822 --> 01:15:19,458
even if he was a bit drunk
when he said so.

851
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:28,998
Busy minute became busy hours,
and busy hours became busy days.

852
01:15:29,243 --> 01:15:36,065
and irrespective of whether they thought
the idea of increasing Grace's services had
any fairness and justification to it or not,

853
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:39,129
it didn't seem to make anyone any happier.

854
01:15:39,245 --> 01:15:41,456
More to the contrary.

855
01:15:43,246 --> 01:15:46,730
Grace, oh.. You have to be more careful.

856
01:15:47,061 --> 01:15:50,755
Liz wasn't very careful either,
but she didn't break our glasses.

857
01:15:51,101 --> 01:15:56,930
I think you need to understand that Mr. Henson
works very hard to grind off any traces of moulds.

858
01:15:57,443 --> 01:16:01,300
and it makes the glass weak.
I thought you knew that.

859
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:05,200
It won't happen again.
Of course, I'll pay for it.

860
01:16:05,901 --> 01:16:09,595
No, of course not. You don't have to
pay us for it. We'll get over it.

861
01:16:11,553 --> 01:16:17,340
[Narrator] And off she went to keep
her appointment with Chuck to free
the last tree trunks from the grass

862
01:16:17,362 --> 01:16:20,427
in order to keep the ever busy mice away.

863
01:16:21,204 --> 01:16:24,919
She was in a hurry and took the shortcut
between the gooseberry bushes,

864
01:16:24,965 --> 01:16:27,175
only to be brought up by a shout.

865
01:16:27,275 --> 01:16:29,126
- Grace!
- Yes!

866
01:16:31,778 --> 01:16:37,600
Oh, I didn't see that you just
raked the path. I'm sorry.

867
01:16:37,632 --> 01:16:39,697
It isn't that I've just raked it.

868
01:16:39,897 --> 01:16:44,400
The idea is that people can pass
around the bushes completely.

869
01:16:44,485 --> 01:16:46,526
I prefer it that way,
as you should know.

870
01:16:47,727 --> 01:16:53,001
I thought that these chains were put up
to make a path between the bushes.

871
01:16:53,011 --> 01:16:55,195
They were put up there to protect the bushes.

872
01:16:55,198 --> 01:16:57,000
It is not supposed to be a pathway.

873
01:16:57,068 --> 01:16:58,834
But everyone goes this way.

874
01:16:59,488 --> 01:17:02,954
Dear, that's right.
They have been living here for years.

875
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,611
You haven't been here that long.

876
01:17:06,105 --> 01:17:12,300
Are you saying, that I am less entitled
to use the shortcut
because I haven't always lived here?

877
01:17:12,365 --> 01:17:13,128
No, of course not.
