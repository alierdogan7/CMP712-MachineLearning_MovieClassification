1
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:12,808
A psychic is manipulating
and using subjective energy...

2
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:16,010
...energy of the non-physical nature...

3
00:00:16,173 --> 00:00:19,961
...in order to achieve a non-effect.

4
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:24,684
Mentalists, magicians, these types
of folks, they manipulate perception...

5
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:29,973
...by distraction and some trickery in order
to receive a desired effect or result.

6
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:34,285
But that's a real long jump
from being a gifted psychic.

7
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:38,168
I'm not saying it's rubbish.
I'm just saying I've never seen it.

8
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:42,963
I'd be very happy to believe it
if someone presented me with proof.

9
00:00:43,373 --> 00:00:48,686
I wouldn't equate Patrick Jane's
mental ability with psychic ability.

10
00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:50,411
It's not a paranormal function.

11
00:00:50,573 --> 00:00:53,883
When it comes to believers and skeptics,
sheeps and goats basically...

12
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:57,648
...you know, there's an old saying,
for believers, no proof is necessary...

13
00:00:57,813 --> 00:00:59,769
...and for skeptics, no proof is possible.

14
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:04,529
I've never met a real psychic.
It truly does not exist.

15
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:10,405
There are ways scientifically
to basically explain any bit of anything...

16
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:13,849
...that can be considered to be
quote-unquote, "psychic phenomenon."

17
00:01:14,013 --> 00:01:16,766
I'm a scientist. I was trained
in how you do the scientific method.

18
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:19,208
You do experiments,
you replicate your experiment...

19
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:20,488
...you replicate your data.

20
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:22,644
But this phenomena
doesn't work like a machine.

21
00:01:22,813 --> 00:01:25,532
When I meet someone
who professes to be a psychic...

22
00:01:25,693 --> 00:01:29,368
...or professes to have
some kind of paranormal ability...

23
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:33,845
...my simple response inwardly oftentimes
is "prove it."

24
00:01:34,013 --> 00:01:35,765
I tend to disbelieve a lot of what I hear...

25
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:40,370
...because a substantial portion of what
people learn about in this field is garbage.

26
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:43,331
I'd say, what, 98 percent of it.
Throw it out, forget it.

27
00:01:43,493 --> 00:01:44,972
It's absolute... Absolutely worthless.

28
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:47,931
You get to the core of this,
the real researchers, the real people...

29
00:01:48,093 --> 00:01:49,845
...to the real data, it's extraordinary.

30
00:01:50,013 --> 00:01:53,050
But one thing we do know,
if these things never occurred...

31
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:56,052
...we wouldn't be here discussing it.
If they occur all the time...

32
00:01:56,213 --> 00:01:59,171
...and we could control them,
we wouldn't be here discussing it.

33
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:03,571
So that means there's an aspect of the
world we live in we know a little bit about.

34
00:02:03,773 --> 00:02:06,810
And we have to ask ourselves,
is it nature versus nurture?

35
00:02:06,973 --> 00:02:09,487
Is someone born in this environment
that's accepting of it...

36
00:02:09,653 --> 00:02:11,371
...so then it's cultivated naturally?

37
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:13,410
Or is it a genetic component?

38
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:15,370
I think there might be a little bit of both.

39
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:19,128
The best analogy to me is
we can all drive cars.

40
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:21,887
Maybe not as well as others,
but we can all drive.

41
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:23,771
How many of us have the stamina...

42
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:26,367
...the endurance,
the hand-eye-foot coordination...

43
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:28,564
...the reflexes to become a race driver?

44
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:31,372
And psychic information is not logical,
it's not rational.

45
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:32,568
It's not linear.

46
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:36,487
It's just an obtuse perception
of information.

47
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:38,371
TAFF: The research I did at UCLA,
the lab work...

48
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,489
...part of it developed
into a training program...

49
00:02:40,653 --> 00:02:44,043
...to see if we could take normal,
healthy, emotionally stable people...

50
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:47,762
...who haven't had any experiences,
to their knowledge, and train it in them.

51
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:50,084
And going into that world...

52
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:54,565
...and discerning information and making it
objective, verifiable and factual.

53
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,610
We had thousands of people
come to the program...

54
00:02:56,773 --> 00:02:58,126
...most had no results at all.

55
00:02:58,373 --> 00:03:01,285
But there was a small percentage
on the far end of the spectrum...

56
00:03:01,453 --> 00:03:04,013
...who were, like, athletes,
they were stars.

57
00:03:04,173 --> 00:03:06,971
What that means, why it is,
God only knows.

58
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:09,562
It may be we're physiologically
or neurologically different.

59
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,808
We're wired different.

60
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:13,168
And the nature of my ability
is pretty simple.

61
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:17,121
I'm primarily visual. I get information.
What's called clairvoyance.

62
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:19,124
Information comes
at a very holistic fashion...

63
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:21,887
...that resembles hearing, seeing,
all these things.

64
00:03:22,053 --> 00:03:25,250
But it's all internal versus sub...
Versus external.

65
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,369
I know for myself
and a few other people...

66
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:31,725
...we're very sensitive to changes in the
Earth's magnetic field. Dramatically so.

67
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:34,009
I'm not actually using my eyes
or using my ears...

68
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,767
...or using my...
You know, any of these... Or hands.

69
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:39,533
This feeling is not something
that's tangible.

70
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:42,526
It's more of a sensation
that I have to interpret.

71
00:03:42,693 --> 00:03:46,129
TAFF: The people who are most adept at
this, who responded the most quickly...

72
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:48,409
...were the most, like,
emotionally unstable.

73
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:50,211
Did you put a spell on Cody Elkins?

74
00:03:50,373 --> 00:03:51,522
I did.

75
00:03:52,173 --> 00:03:53,765
I put a killing spell on him.

76
00:03:54,493 --> 00:03:59,328
I've done the spell several times before
but this is the first time it's worked.

77
00:03:59,493 --> 00:04:00,892
ROURKE:
Here's a caveat.

78
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:05,171
When you open the door, so to speak,
you can't really close it.

79
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,370
Once you make yourself aware
to this new aspect of yourself...

80
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:12,208
...this new way of receiving information,
you will never be the same.

81
00:04:12,373 --> 00:04:14,409
MAN:
Alison!

82
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:16,764
TAFF: An example,
which is a little more disturbing.

83
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,289
1975...

84
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:22,361
...I'm dreaming that I'm flying a 747.

85
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:27,129
It was a TWA and I've been a pilot for
years so I know a little bit about aircraft.

86
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:31,411
And in the dream, we're on approach
to South Africa.

87
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:35,646
And suddenly, the turbo fans cut out,
the drone goes away.

88
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:38,452
We're dropping like a stone,
the instruments are dark, we hit.

89
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:41,846
I fly out of bed, covered in perspiration.

90
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:46,131
And I remembered,
"My God, a 747 has never gone down."

91
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,085
I didn't know what day
it was gonna happen...

92
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:50,369
...what time it was gonna happen,
what flight number.

93
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:53,406
So I could've called TWA,
I could've called the FAA.

94
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:55,564
I can't do it
because I don't know anything.

95
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:59,607
Three days later, the first 747 went down
on approach to South Africa.

96
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:01,729
It was the TWA.

97
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:06,082
If you did that today, the FBI would be
at your door in probably 20 minutes.

98
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:11,407
I'm a former supervisory special agent
of the FBI for 27 years.

99
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:15,202
My main emphasis while I was with
the FBI was the Violent Crime Program...

100
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:20,527
...which entailed all of kidnappings
throughout the southern California area.

101
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:24,766
Typically, I get involved
with law enforcement issues...

102
00:05:24,973 --> 00:05:26,770
...in what's called an unofficial capacity.

103
00:05:26,973 --> 00:05:31,012
I'm not able really to comment on some of
the "official" relationships I have.

104
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:33,846
And all those "official" relationships
are "unofficial."

105
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:37,164
I think that the relationship
between psychics and law enforcement...

106
00:05:37,373 --> 00:05:39,489
...is somewhat...

107
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:42,482
...kind of kept in the back, so to speak.

108
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:44,769
The law enforcement,
they wanna do their job...

109
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:49,330
...they wanna go out there, investigate it,
find the person who did, make the arrest.

110
00:05:49,493 --> 00:05:53,202
I'm not reaching to say the preconception
about a lot of psychics is they're nuts.

111
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:56,649
I make and sell Wicca healing powders
on the Internet.

112
00:05:56,813 --> 00:05:58,246
You should check out my website.

113
00:05:58,413 --> 00:06:03,612
Nobody in law enforcement that I know of
goes to the psychic first off.

114
00:06:03,773 --> 00:06:05,843
The police asked me to get a psychic fix
on him...

115
00:06:06,013 --> 00:06:07,969
...to see if I can get a sense
of who this man is.

116
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:11,370
That's probably the last person
they're gonna go to.

117
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:16,203
- We are tools. Psychics don't solve crimes.
- They're not stable.

118
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:18,807
Cody deserved to die.
He was a bad person.

119
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:22,290
He stole and tortured and killed my cat.

120
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:26,366
Maybe that's what gives some of them
the ability to do this, when they want.

121
00:06:26,573 --> 00:06:30,407
You would use one when all of your
other avenues have been exhausted.

122
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:33,610
And if you don't have anything else,
why not?

123
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:38,403
I've never read a case or seen a show...

124
00:06:38,573 --> 00:06:40,245
...where they actually
did make anything...

125
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:44,929
...other than the broadest possible
connections to the realities of the case.

126
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:46,970
ROURKE: Because when we open up
psychically, you know...

127
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:49,966
...it's a doorway that everything
can come through.

128
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,363
So you'll get things
that are pertinent to the case...

129
00:06:52,573 --> 00:06:55,007
...and things
that are maybe not so pertinent.

130
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:56,891
It's a technique of generalizing...

131
00:06:57,053 --> 00:07:00,966
...a technique of never quite being able
to pin down what it is they're saying...

132
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:04,085
...so that eventually they're gonna hit
the right mark.

133
00:07:04,253 --> 00:07:08,371
Yes, I'm feeling that Paul hasn't been
a hundred percent honest with you.

134
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:13,167
He hasn't been happy.

135
00:07:14,173 --> 00:07:17,210
I have yet to meet one that I think,
in any way, is doing anything...

136
00:07:17,373 --> 00:07:19,728
...other than guessing
and occasionally getting it right.

137
00:07:19,893 --> 00:07:22,009
The blind squirrel
eventually gets the nuts.

138
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:24,289
During my career in the FBI...

139
00:07:24,453 --> 00:07:27,286
...I did have occasion to work
with different psychics.

140
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:30,729
Kidnappings tend to lend themselves more
to that field...

141
00:07:30,893 --> 00:07:32,884
...than probably any other investigation...

142
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,964
...with exception to maybe homicides.

143
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,249
They'd give us things to hold
relevant to the crime.

144
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:42,009
Clothing, artifacts, a wallet,
a piece of jewelry.

145
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:43,208
It's called psychometry.

146
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:45,967
It's a very powerful tool
in discerning information.

147
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:49,848
Because we... Every living thing
has an atmosphere.

148
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:52,322
You start describing details
about the person...

149
00:07:52,493 --> 00:07:56,850
...like their families, their friends,
mental problems, physical illnesses.

150
00:07:57,013 --> 00:07:59,288
A mentalist can't do that.
But a psychic can.

151
00:07:59,453 --> 00:08:03,162
ROURKE: So let's say that, you know,
a murderer drops the weapon...

152
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,928
...or a victim leaves a shoe
or a bloodstained piece of jewelry...

153
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:08,572
...and the psychic can use that.

154
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:12,965
For me, the more graphic something was,
the more easily I was able to see it

155
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:19,406
TAFF: I haven't done this work in a while
because it's very depressing.

156
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:21,564
You see these horrible images
in your head.

157
00:08:21,773 --> 00:08:25,732
And if you're very sensitive to this,
emotionally, it's best to just stay away.

158
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:28,361
We are like the planets in the universe.

159
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:30,370
We have our own electromagnetic field.

160
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:34,890
And in that field is stored information
and any property that are on our person...

161
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:39,763
...or that we hold or manipulate stores
and can store that information.

162
00:08:39,973 --> 00:08:42,885
And we provided graphic details...

163
00:08:43,053 --> 00:08:45,772
...of where the body was,
the instrument of death...

164
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:47,770
...description of the damage
to the body...

165
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:50,686
...and they found the person basically
where we described.

166
00:08:50,853 --> 00:08:53,811
Psychic evidence
or evidences attached to a psychic...

167
00:08:53,973 --> 00:08:57,249
...really, it doesn't fall under that umbrella
of evidence.

168
00:08:57,413 --> 00:09:00,086
It's more used as an investigative tool.

169
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:03,882
I wouldn't walk into a courtroom solely
on a psychic's information...

170
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:06,613
...and try to get a search warrant
or an arrest warrant.

171
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:08,923
I have to have corroborating evidence...

172
00:09:09,093 --> 00:09:11,243
...that's going to help me
with that information.

173
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:15,884
These... The cases are intriguing,
they're spectacular.

174
00:09:16,053 --> 00:09:21,844
But you gotta walk sort of a very
thin line to avoid getting people angry.

175
00:09:22,013 --> 00:09:24,811
Those psychics who do that
tend to be taking advantage...

176
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:28,568
...of a very highly-charged
emotional situation in small towns...

177
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:30,525
...where they come in and say,
"I can help."

178
00:09:30,693 --> 00:09:32,684
True demonic evil burns like fire.

179
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:36,528
It burns with a terrible, cold, dark flame.

180
00:09:36,693 --> 00:09:39,685
I force myself to look into that flame.

181
00:09:39,853 --> 00:09:42,413
And I see an image of the evildoer.

182
00:09:42,573 --> 00:09:45,292
In homicides, kidnappings
and a variety of cases...

183
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:48,251
...police will withhold information.

184
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:51,405
And the really good reason
for doing that...

185
00:09:51,573 --> 00:09:54,531
...is there are specific things
that happen during a crime.

186
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:59,164
And only the person involved in that crime
is gonna be aware of those things.

187
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:01,364
SONNENBERG:
That's kind of used as a filter.

188
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:03,922
If anyone needs arresting,
it's Kristina Frye.

189
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:06,090
She knew that Rosemary was in danger.

190
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:09,165
She knew where to find the car,
the murder weapon.

191
00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:12,206
Which means that she either
does have supernatural powers...

192
00:10:12,373 --> 00:10:14,011
...or she was involved in the crime.

193
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:15,925
Filters out those
who think they were there...

194
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:18,926
...and it filters out people
who believe they're psychics, who aren't.

195
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:23,166
On more than one occasion,
the law enforcement thought me...

196
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:27,611
We might have been part
of the actual perpetration of the crime...

197
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:30,367
...because we convey
such specific details...

198
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:33,366
...with regard to the location
and the actual method of death...

199
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:35,962
...and the mechanism
by which the person was killed.

200
00:10:36,373 --> 00:10:38,409
You knew that this murder
was gonna happen?

201
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:40,092
I didn't know. Her husband knew.

202
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:42,562
I just passed the warning along
to Rosemary.

203
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:45,122
Okay, got it. By her own admission...

204
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:49,172
...she's either a channel for the energy
of the departed souls...

205
00:10:49,373 --> 00:10:51,364
...or she's involved in this murder.

206
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:53,484
You got a choice.
You can call Ghost Busters...

207
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,371
...or we can take this lady downtown.

208
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:58,730
Well, if the psychic calls up
and they've got detailed information...

209
00:10:58,893 --> 00:11:03,330
...that we have not given to anyone else,
including family members...

210
00:11:03,493 --> 00:11:06,246
...there's only two things here.
Either, one, he's a good psychic...

211
00:11:06,413 --> 00:11:09,803
...and he really does do this legitimately
and has information...

212
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:11,964
...that could be of value
and give us good leads...

213
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:14,004
...or he's involved in the crime.

214
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:18,086
We had to actually provide alibis
when they came to us.

215
00:11:18,253 --> 00:11:20,972
You know, there's always the possibility
it leaked out somewhere.

216
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:23,926
But you've also gotta consider
that they may be a credible source.

217
00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:25,890
They absolutely are very intense
about that...

218
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,362
...because in their heart of hearts,
their soul of souls...

219
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:33,368
...they know the information
that they have is of value.

220
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:36,650
And so I'm not a disbeliever
in the use of psychics...

221
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:40,362
...or in the fact that there's people
out there that maybe do see things...

222
00:11:40,573 --> 00:11:45,124
...and get information that is helpful
for law enforcement.

223
00:11:45,293 --> 00:11:47,648
There was another case
where a young man had gone missing...

224
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:50,768
...and he actually had
some mental illness.

225
00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:53,089
As I tried to connect
with this missing young man...

226
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:54,891
...I started feeling confused.

227
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:56,930
And things felt random,
they felt out of place.

228
00:11:57,093 --> 00:12:00,847
And to me, it almost seemed
like the information they had...

229
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,571
...was kind of a burden on them.

230
00:12:02,773 --> 00:12:06,163
They felt like they had to come forward
and give this information.

231
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,891
This had a happy ending, this case.

232
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:13,844
Because once I gave them the location
of where I believed this person was...

233
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:17,369
...this kid I had a link with, the police
picked him up and there he was.

234
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:20,605
As far as psychics getting more involved
in law enforcement work...

235
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:21,967
...the more acceptance of it.

236
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:25,569
I think depending on the...
How progressive a department is.

237
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:28,924
I have a friend that...
Who was a law enforcement officer...

238
00:12:29,093 --> 00:12:32,483
...with a local police department
and he became an FBI agent...

239
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:37,124
...and he swears he had a case that
the psychic came in, was dead to rights.

240
00:12:37,293 --> 00:12:39,761
He told them where the person was,
who did it, the whole thing.

241
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,924
And it turned out they were right.

242
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:43,685
So, you know, it happens.

243
00:12:43,853 --> 00:12:46,572
I'm not a disbeliever.

244
00:12:46,773 --> 00:12:50,129
We had a little time with a guy
from the FBI. I did ask him, I said:

245
00:12:50,293 --> 00:12:55,572
"Have you ever worked with psychics?"
The first thing that Mark said was, "Yeah.

246
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,371
They always say the body is near water."

247
00:12:57,573 --> 00:13:01,771
Water rushing into the windows,
tires underwater, resting on concrete.

248
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:10,404
If the information isn't accurate, if the
information can't be verified as fact...

249
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:12,643
...you're not providing
psychic information.

250
00:13:12,813 --> 00:13:16,044
Come on.
She simply did what you do so well.

251
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,408
With an air of confidence,
she made an educated guess.

252
00:13:18,573 --> 00:13:20,484
Where else would you dump a car
around here?

253
00:13:20,653 --> 00:13:22,564
She's a good guesser.

254
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:23,768
Well, yes.

255
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:27,608
Over the last,
let's say, close to half a century...

256
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,970
...the attitude has become
sort of jaundiced, it's kind of jaded...

257
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:34,808
...because the media, generally, has
a knee-jerk reaction to the paranormal.

258
00:13:34,973 --> 00:13:36,452
And you're generally negative.

259
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:39,810
And unfortunately, like so many things
with genuine talents...

260
00:13:39,973 --> 00:13:42,965
...the presence of scamsters
serves to undermine those people...

261
00:13:43,173 --> 00:13:44,765
...who may genuinely have those beliefs.

262
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:47,367
I'd go out on the limb
and say anyone who sits in this chair...

263
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:49,450
...and says they're sitting
at a restaurant...

264
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:52,764
...and spirits come up and talk to them,
you know, I think they're in trouble.

265
00:13:52,973 --> 00:13:55,009
That's really not healthy.

266
00:13:55,213 --> 00:13:59,445
[WOMAN CHANTING INCANTATION]

267
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:02,572
They may be wonderful people
but they're essentially tricksters.

268
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:06,652
One of the biggest comments made
by people over the course of centuries...

269
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:09,327
...regarding the paranormal is
if you can see the future...

270
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:11,211
...if you can sense things
before they occur...

271
00:14:11,373 --> 00:14:13,011
...see through walls
and through people...

272
00:14:13,173 --> 00:14:16,768
...why don't you make millions of dollars
in the stock market or go to Vegas?

273
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:19,766
It's like if you had superhero powers,
would you really fight crime...

274
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:22,567
...or would you use them
for your own personal things, you know?

275
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:24,769
This ability doesn't work like a machine.

276
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:26,844
And for everyone, it works differently.

277
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:28,571
It's not a conscious process.

278
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:33,443
For the most part, it's not that voluntary
and it does what it wants to do.

279
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:36,127
Which doesn't relate to physical things.

280
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:39,444
Whatever this functioning is,
however it's designed...

281
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:44,403
...it is a function
that is meant to serve others.

282
00:14:44,573 --> 00:14:46,723
It is not meant to serve yourself.

283
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:49,248
It's far more complex
than we ever thought it was.

284
00:14:49,413 --> 00:14:52,723
I certainly want to believe
in the idea of paranormal abilities...

285
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:57,364
...and, you know, people who have
paranormal beliefs or talents.

286
00:14:57,573 --> 00:14:59,962
My mum actually
has a very unnerving talent...

287
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:04,126
...of dreaming about people close to us
dying and then they die.

288
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:06,966
So I've always said to her,
"If you ever have a dream about me...

289
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:08,168
...just don't mention it."

290
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,689
I think that perhaps there are people
who have abilities.

291
00:15:11,853 --> 00:15:15,892
I think that the majority of people
who have signs on their lawns...

292
00:15:16,053 --> 00:15:19,170
...and who are advertising for it
probably don't.

293
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:22,809
So they either really genuinely believe
what they're doing is real...

294
00:15:22,973 --> 00:15:25,043
...they fool themselves to believing
they're real...

295
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:29,172
...or they're even more evil
than I believe they are in the first place.

296
00:15:29,373 --> 00:15:33,286
I've never truly seen a psychic
that couldn't state anything...

297
00:15:33,453 --> 00:15:36,206
...more than the obvious.
So I'm a skeptic.

298
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:37,567
There's also another angle...

299
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:41,282
...which is people will always believe
what they want to believe.

300
00:15:41,453 --> 00:15:44,570
We did an episode called "Seeing Red"...

301
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:50,364
...where Jane is confronted with a woman
who purports to be a real psychic...

302
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,171
...and is very, very good at it.

303
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:54,841
I think you act assured and arrogant.

304
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:58,767
But inside, you are troubled
with deep guilt and self-Loathing.

305
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:01,972
A recent trauma in your past perhaps.

306
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,972
And I love the idea that occasionally
something happens...

307
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:08,489
...where you doubt your own commitment
to that decision.

308
00:16:08,653 --> 00:16:14,171
The episode ends with her giving him an
insight into what happened to his family.

309
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,803
- I talked to your wife.
- Oh, hang on. This is...

310
00:16:16,973 --> 00:16:21,364
That he desperately wants to believe
is true.

311
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:25,168
Your wife wants me to tell you
that your daughter never woke up.

312
00:16:25,373 --> 00:16:27,409
She didn't know what happened.

313
00:16:27,573 --> 00:16:30,167
She wasn't scared.
Not even for a second.

314
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:32,409
I think he wants to believe...

315
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:34,882
...that they didn't suffer,
didn't go through these things.

316
00:16:35,053 --> 00:16:37,965
There's a beautiful moment at the end
where you're inside Jane's head.

317
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:40,966
Because she has touched
on the one sacred thing in his life...

318
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,168
...and that's his family.

319
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,086
And his competitive nature
towards psychics...

320
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:48,131
...and his sort of insecurities
and how he felt threatened.

321
00:16:48,293 --> 00:16:53,606
But my narcissism will allow me
to accept something...

322
00:16:53,773 --> 00:16:57,925
...if it has impact or bearing on me
individually.

323
00:16:58,093 --> 00:17:01,529
It's a constant question that comes up
thematically, like, is he or isn't he?

324
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:03,968
And I think it's really interesting.

325
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:09,088
And it really makes you think, what is
the nature of the human condition?

326
00:17:09,253 --> 00:17:12,643
I now there's things out there
that's way beyond my understanding.

327
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:19,730
So I'm willing to keep that 1 percent
open to, you know, other possibilities.

328
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:23,647
And we say there's the possibility
that there are people with these gifts...

329
00:17:23,813 --> 00:17:26,611
...on the other side, there's the
possibility that there are people...

330
00:17:26,773 --> 00:17:28,126
...who are very good at guesswork.

331
00:17:28,293 --> 00:17:31,649
I don't doubt that maybe
there is someone out there...

332
00:17:31,813 --> 00:17:33,804
...who can do those sort of things.

333
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:36,203
But what the end of the show
demonstrates...

334
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:42,482
...is that which we most devoutly wish
to be real becomes real.
