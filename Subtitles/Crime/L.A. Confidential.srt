The sun shines bright,
the beaches are wide and inviting...

...and the orange groves
stretch as far as the eye can see.

4
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:41,040
There are jobs aplenty and land is cheap.

5
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,584
Every workingman
can have his own house...

6
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:48,505
...and inside every house,
a happy, all-American family.

You can have all this.
And who knows?

That's what they tell you, anyway,
because they're selling an image.

13
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,780
They're selling it through movies,
radio and television.

14
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:16,825

the L.A. cops walk on water...

...as they keep the city
clean of crooks.

was the Garden of Eden.

Mickey C's the head
of organized crime in these parts.

He runs dope, rackets and prostitution.
He kills a dozen people a year...

...and the dapper little gent
does it in style.

25

And every time his picture's
on the front page...

26
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,823
...it's a black eye
for the image of Los Angeles.

27
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,450
Because how can organized crime exist...

28
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,162
...in the city with the best
police force in the world?

would work for the Mickster.

But all is not well.

34
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,889
