is as guilty as sin under our legal system.

344
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:34,919
It does not permit vigilante violence,
and he took the law into his own hands.

345
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,589
He murdered two people.

346
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:42,635
Two people who had raped
his 1 0-year-old daughter.

347

-[WHlSPERS] Buddy, have you seen Roark?
-Not yet.

1680
01:54:46,230 --> 01:54:48,898
JAKE:
Doctor, would you explain to the jury...

1681
01:54:49,066 --> 01:54:52,860
...the effect his daughter's rape
had on Mr. Hailey's condition?

1682
01:54:53,279 --> 01:54:55,405
Tonya's rape caused a relapse...

1683
01:54:55,573 --> 01:54:57,740
...a temporary break with reality.

1684
01:54:58,409 --> 01:55:01,452
JAKE:
But yesterday, a Dr. Rodeheaver...

1685
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:04,664
...suggested that Mr. Hailey's
act of calculation was...

1686
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:06,583
...the very definition of sanity.

1687
01:55:06,750 --> 01:55:08,835
That's ridiculous.

1688
01:55:09,003 --> 01:55:12,839
Many of the most famous
schizophrenics are calculating.

1689
01:55:13,007 --> 01:55:14,841
John Hinckley, for example.

1690
01:55:15,009 --> 01:55:16,050
Calculating.

1691
01:55:16,218 --> 01:55:17,719
And legally insane.

1692
01:55:18,053 --> 01:55:20,888
All right, so, Dr. Bass,
how would you diagnose Mr. Hailey...

1693
01:55:21,056 --> 01:55:22,390
...at the time of the murder?

1694
01:55:22,558 --> 01:55:26,853
Mr. Hailey experienced a recurrence
of a dissociative condition...

1695
01:55:27,021 --> 01:55:30,898
...as a result of the trauma
caused by the rape of his daughter.

1696
01:55:31,317 --> 01:55:34,861
Now, since Mr. Hailey was unaware
of the reality of his actions...

1697
01:55:35,029 --> 01:55:37,405
...he could not tell right from wrong.

1698
01:55:37,573 --> 01:55:40,908
Nor could he understand
the consequences of his actions.

1699
01:55:41,076 --> 01:55:44,287
He was, therefore, legally insane.

1700
01:55:45,873 --> 01:55:47,457
Could not tell right from wrong...

1701
01:55:47,625 --> 01:55:50,501
...nor understand the consequences
of his actions.

1702
01:55:51,045 --> 01:55:54,005
Therefore, legally, insane.

1703
01:55:54,673 --> 01:55:58,551
Thank you, Dr. Bass.

Dr. Bass, could you please
state for the record your full name?

1710
01:56:19,239 --> 01:56:21,574
Willard Tyrell Bass.

1711
01:56:21,742 --> 01:56:24,952
Tyrell Bass. That's a very unique name.

1712

Now, doctor,
have you ever been convicted of a felony?

1713
01:56:30,668 --> 01:56:31,959
No, of course not.

-Yes.

testimony you've just given before this jury?

Of course.

1717
01:56:40,427 --> 01:56:42,845
So let me understand this now...

1718
01:56:43,013 --> 01:56:45,390
...since you are under oath.

You"re telling me, and this jury,
that on October 1 7th, 1 960...

...you were not
convicted of statutory rape?

Dr. Bass is not on trial here.

of the credibility of the witness.

tight around her neck...
