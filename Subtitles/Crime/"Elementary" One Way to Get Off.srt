00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:13,389
(woman sobbing quietly)

3
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:33,817
(gunshot, woman screams)

4
00:01:02,422 --> 00:01:04,373
Good morning.

5
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:08,544
And to you, as well.

6
00:01:14,718 --> 00:01:17,136
Okay. This has to stop.

7
00:01:17,138 --> 00:01:19,338
This only speaking
when spoken to thing?

8
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,102
You're obviously angry that
I went to your friend Alistair

9
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:23,403
and that he told me you knew
someone named Irene.

10
00:01:23,405 --> 00:01:25,021
You think I
overstepped my bounds.

11
00:01:25,023 --> 00:01:26,489
Hadn't thought about it
that much at all, actually.

12
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,141
We both know that's not true.

13
00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:30,660
And guess what--
I'm your sober companion.

14
00:01:30,662 --> 00:01:32,612
It's my job to overstep
polite boundaries.

15
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:35,115
Part of recovery is about
addressing painful things.

16
00:01:35,117 --> 00:01:36,983
If you ignore them,
they become triggers.

17
00:01:36,985 --> 00:01:38,651
Could you shoot all this
to me in an e-mail?

18
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:40,537
I'm just much better at
processing the written word.

19
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:43,877
I'm gonna stay after you
about this,

20
00:01:43,902 --> 00:01:45,292
because I know
how important it is.

21
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:47,660
But if you won't talk to me,
there's only so much I can do.

22
00:01:47,662 --> 00:01:50,213
(cell phone chimes)

23
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:56,502
What is it?
You're right.

24
00:01:56,504 --> 00:01:59,139
I have been
cutting you off.

25
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:01,191
It amounts to sulking,

26
00:02:01,193 --> 00:02:04,110
and it is no way to conduct
an adult relationship.

27
00:02:04,112 --> 00:02:05,945
I might not like what you did,

28
00:02:05,947 --> 00:02:07,647
but I suppose I have to...

29
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:09,816
respect your right to do it.

30
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:13,519
Good.

31
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:16,355
I would propose a toast to our
new spirit of collaboration,

32
00:02:16,357 --> 00:02:19,659
but I, um... I've neglected
to pour myself a coffee.

33
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:21,878
Would you mind
waiting a moment?

34
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,529
Of course.

35
00:02:32,756 --> 00:02:35,675
(door opens and closes)

36
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:39,262
Sherlock?

37
00:02:40,714 --> 00:02:43,416
(siren whoops)

38
00:02:43,418 --> 00:02:44,717
No Watson?

39
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,152
She took the morning off.

40
00:02:46,154 --> 00:02:48,771
Something about
a cousin falling ill.

41
00:02:50,024 --> 00:02:51,891
Shall we?
Yeah.

42
00:02:51,893 --> 00:02:53,526
Jay and Amy Myrose.

43
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:55,862
Their cleaning lady
got here this morning,

44
00:02:55,864 --> 00:02:57,197
found them like this.

45
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:59,199
Preliminary times of death
indicate the suspect

46
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:01,167
broke in after midnight,

47
00:03:01,169 --> 00:03:03,369
dragged the Myroses
out of their beds,

48
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:06,873
forced them to give up the
combination to their wall safe,

49
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,742
and then...

50
00:03:09,744 --> 00:03:11,344
I, uh... I got to tell you,

51
00:03:11,346 --> 00:03:13,179
coming in here
this morning

52
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:16,082
was like waking up in the
middle of a nightmare

53
00:03:16,084 --> 00:03:18,885
that I thought I stopped
having a long time ago.

54
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:21,054
Is that because of the
uncanny similarities

55
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:24,390
to the Wade Crewes
murders in 1999?

56
00:03:24,392 --> 00:03:26,142
You-you know about that?

57
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:28,194
I picked up the particulars
of these deaths

58
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:30,230
on my scanner app while
I was taxiing over here.

59
00:03:30,232 --> 00:03:33,032
Victims' arms bound
with pile hitch knots,

60
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:35,318
pillows strapped
to their heads using belts

61
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,819
shortly before
they were killed.

62
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:40,540
Have to admit, the
similarities are striking.

63
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:42,208
Yes, no, no, I know.

64
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,994
I just didn't think you'd
know about Wade Crewes.

65
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:47,664
13 years ago, he perpetrated
three separate home invasions

66
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,915
over the course
of three months.

67
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,383
In every instance,
a wealthy couple

68
00:03:50,385 --> 00:03:51,918
murdered in the middle
of the night.

69
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,586
Contents of their
wall safe emptied.

70
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:57,056
Eventually, he was brought
to justice by, uh... you.

71
00:03:57,058 --> 00:03:58,308
Yeah.

72
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,677
Something of a
career-defining case.

73
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:03,296
Mmm. Of course I'm
familiar with it.

74
00:04:03,298 --> 00:04:04,764
There.

75
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,266
Always nice when
a psychopath

76
00:04:06,268 --> 00:04:08,935
grooms himself to look the part,
don't you think?

77
00:04:08,937 --> 00:04:12,488
Question is,
why copycat a home invader?

78
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,625
You think this is
the work of a copycat?

79
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:18,278
Well, it's either that, or...

80
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,663
some kind of
weird coincidence.

81
00:04:20,665 --> 00:04:22,415
There is another
possibility.

82
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:25,034
But that depends on what
we find in the shoe closet.

83
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:27,320
HOLMES: I noticed something odd
in the old case files.

84
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:29,789
Two of the safes
that Crewes looted

85
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,157
were located in bedroom closets.

86
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:32,542
The other was in an office,

87
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:34,043
but he rifled through
the bedroom anyway.

88
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:37,046
Now, in each case,
the woman of the house

89
00:04:37,048 --> 00:04:38,598
had a collection
of expensive shoes.

90
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,184
And in every case,
one of those shoes

91
00:04:41,186 --> 00:04:42,668
was missing
after the murder.

92
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,170
See for yourself.

93
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:46,806
Why would someone
steal one shoe?

94
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:48,391
Well, that's a
fair question.

95
00:04:48,393 --> 00:04:50,059
My guess is
the perpetrator

96
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:53,863
wanted a little something
to memorialize the occasion.

97
00:04:56,817 --> 00:05:00,320
Something like,
perhaps...

98
00:05:00,322 --> 00:05:04,190
one high-heeled
Jimmy Choo.

99
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:12,531
Wade Crewes told you
that he worked alone

100
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:14,751
when he confessed
in 1999.

101
00:05:14,753 --> 00:05:16,419
I think he lied.

102
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:18,221
I don't believe that
we're looking for someone

103
00:05:18,223 --> 00:05:19,972
who's copying his work.

104
00:05:19,974 --> 00:05:22,609
I think we're looking for
someone who helped him do it.

GREGSON: Garrity, Ramberg,
I'm pulling you in.

I'm gonna detail a few other
detectives out of other units.

114

Any questions?

115

All right, then.

116

Captain, if I might
venture a suggestion?

117
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:10,715
You and I go
to Sing Sing,

118
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:11,883
talk to
Wade Crewes, hmm?

119
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:13,185
We now know
there's a connection

120
00:06:13,187 --> 00:06:14,853
between the old murders
and the new ones,

121
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:17,439
and Crewes is the one man
who can tell us what it is.

122
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:19,941
Waste of time. He'd tell you he
was partnered with the Taliban

123
00:06:19,943 --> 00:06:21,559
if it'd shave time
off his sentence.

124
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:24,562
And we don't know
there's a connection.

125
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:26,898
Oh. The missing
high heel.

126
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,202
Don't people lose shoes all the time?
Not $1,000 ones.

127
00:06:30,204 --> 00:06:32,421
I-I have to say, you seem
strangely reluctant

128
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:33,738
to pursue a
promising lead.

129
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,425
Because it's not
a lead yet.

130
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:38,176
It's not
an anything yet.

131
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:39,761
Maybe you'll turn out
to be right,

132
00:06:39,763 --> 00:06:41,246
but talking
to Wade Crewes

133
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:42,881
is not going
to get you there.

134
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:44,549
I promise you.

135
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:45,767
(cell phone buzzing)

136
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:47,552
Oh.

137
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:49,471
Watson, I admire
your persistence,

138
00:06:49,473 --> 00:06:51,756
but the reception
is really... where... am.

139
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:54,092
Really? 'Cause my
phone's working fine.

140
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:55,977
Four bars
and everything.

141
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,262
Let me guess:

142
00:06:57,264 --> 00:06:59,731
You want me to wait right here

143
00:06:59,733 --> 00:07:02,100
while you get another coffee.
Or you could just leave.

144
00:07:02,102 --> 00:07:03,285
Okay, I don't think ditching me

145
00:07:03,287 --> 00:07:04,736
is the most
constructive approach.

146
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:06,121
Well, it solved the
problem, didn't it?

147
00:07:06,123 --> 00:07:07,706
It's quite simple, Watson.

148
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:09,541
Stop trying to reach me,
and things can go back

149
00:07:09,543 --> 00:07:11,710
to the way that they were.
You know I'm not gonna do that.

150
00:07:11,712 --> 00:07:13,545
Well, then, welcome to
our new arrangement.

151
00:07:13,547 --> 00:07:15,831
Same as the old one, without
the goodwill that you'd accrued.

152
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,549
I will obey the letter
of our agreement.

153
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:19,501
I will check in with you
every two hours,

154
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:21,753
at which point you can give me
whatever drug tests that you want.

155
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:24,222
My bodily fluids are all at your disposal.
That's not how this works...

156
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:25,424
I'm not finished.
Oh, you're not finished.

157
00:07:25,426 --> 00:07:26,791
What is <i>not</i> at your disposal

158
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:28,093
are the details
of my personal life,

159
00:07:28,095 --> 00:07:29,678
which are uniquely my own,

160
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,563
and which I will not cheapen
by allowing them to become

161
00:07:31,565 --> 00:07:33,732
grist for your
tedious recovery mill.

162
00:07:33,734 --> 00:07:35,400
All right, then.

163
00:07:35,402 --> 00:07:36,902
That's that.

164
00:07:36,904 --> 00:07:39,271
I will check in with you
in two hours.

165
00:07:39,273 --> 00:07:40,655
Hmm.

166
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:42,858
Holmes...

167
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,409
Bell's got something.

168
00:07:44,411 --> 00:07:47,412
All right, CCS dug
through the Myroses' laptop.

169
00:07:47,414 --> 00:07:49,197
They each got a bunch
of threatening e-mails

170
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,749
from the same anonymous account.

171
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:53,168
We traced the IP address
to a guy named Julian Walsh.

172
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,703
Guy's a contractor.

173
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:56,621
The Myroses hired him
to remodel their kitchen,

174
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:58,373
and then fired him
six weeks later.

175
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,958
They filed a complaint
about his work

176
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,659
and withheld payment.

177
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:03,929
And Walsh responded
with anonymous threats.

178
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:05,597
We ran him through the NCIC.

179
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,882
He did time
for weapons possession

180
00:08:06,884 --> 00:08:08,133
and sexual assault.

181
00:08:08,135 --> 00:08:11,103
We're going to go
talk to him now.

182
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:12,854
That's a lead.

183
00:08:12,856 --> 00:08:15,307
BELL: <i>"When you least expect it,</i>
<i>I'll be there</i>

184
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:16,775
"to give you what's yours.

185
00:08:16,777 --> 00:08:18,643
"A pair of pliers
and a handful of rusty nails

186
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:19,945
are the only tools I need."

187
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:21,196
Sound familiar, Mr. Walsh?

188
00:08:21,198 --> 00:08:23,565
Okay, yes, I sent those e-mails.

189
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,484
But that doesn't mean
I killed anybody.

190
00:08:25,486 --> 00:08:27,619
Well, you talked
about killing people,

191
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:29,854
and they wound up dead.
I'm sure you can follow along.

192
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:31,790
I don't know
what you want me to say.

193
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:33,175
BELL:
Well, listen,

194
00:08:33,177 --> 00:08:34,526
we'll be more inclined
to believe you

195
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:35,961
if you gave us
your whereabouts

196
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:37,629
between 6:00
and midnight last night.

197
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,265
I watched TV, and then
I went to bed by 11:00.

198
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:42,501
I live alone, but that
doesn't mean I did anything.

199
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,388
BELL: You understand why
we're here, Julian.

200
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,340
The people you threatened
in these e-mails are now dead.

201
00:08:48,342 --> 00:08:50,725
JULIAN:
Yeah, well...

202
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:53,428
You with us here?
Yep.

203
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,181
I just want to see if
the house has a basement.

204
00:08:56,183 --> 00:08:58,016
Walsh has looked at
the floor three times

205
00:08:58,018 --> 00:08:59,401
since he started talking.

206
00:08:59,403 --> 00:09:00,902
He's clearly nervous.

207
00:09:00,904 --> 00:09:02,887
I bet whatever he's
hiding is down there.

208
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:06,024
Okay, I'll cut this off
and get us a warrant.

209
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:07,826
And give him time to
get rid of the evidence?

210
00:09:07,828 --> 00:09:09,727
Mr. Walsh, do you have
a lavatory I might use?

211
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:12,247
Huh?
Bathroom.

212
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:15,233
Yeah, upstairs.

213
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:33,768
(chain clinks)

214
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:37,138
(chain links rattling)

215
00:09:40,943 --> 00:09:43,595
(chain links rattling)

216
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:51,736
Identify yourself.

217
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:54,272
(whimpering)

218
00:09:55,124 --> 00:09:57,742
(woman speaking Russian)

219
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:07,802
What the hell are you doing?

220
00:10:07,804 --> 00:10:10,138
He lied.

221
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,807
When he said that
he lived alone.

222
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:17,979
(whimpers)

223
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,733
Shh.

224
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:24,302
(speaking Russian)

225
00:10:27,973 --> 00:10:29,324
Arrest him!

226
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:30,808
GREGSON: Arrest him.
Turn to the wall now.

227
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,496
(speaking Russian)
Shh, shh, shh...

228
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:37,032
(sobbing)

229
00:10:38,284 --> 00:10:39,984
WATSON:
<i>You have to understand,</i>

230
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:42,020
<i>this my nuclear option.</i>

231
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:45,490
I've never felt the need to
go to a client's rehab before.

232
00:10:45,492 --> 00:10:48,994
Yeah, but Mr. Holmes
isn't a typical client.

233
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:51,196
He just won't
let me help him.

234
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:53,164
He's so adamant about
being above all that.

235
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:57,135
Yeah, he does make it difficult
to keep one's cool, doesn't he?

236
00:10:57,137 --> 00:10:59,387
Please.
Thank you.

237
00:11:00,356 --> 00:11:01,806
I know from his records

238
00:11:01,808 --> 00:11:04,526
he spent two hours a day
in therapy with you.

239
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:07,178
Did he ever mention
a woman named Irene?

240
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,699
Sherlock Holmes
was here for six months,

241
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:14,452
and in that time,
he mentioned no women, no men,

242
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:16,187
no names, no dates.

243
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:18,073
I don't believe I learned

244
00:11:18,075 --> 00:11:20,992
a single significant
thing about him.

245
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:23,328
(siren wails)

246
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,914
(woman sobbing,
speaking Russian)

247
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,999
(Holmes speaks Russian)

248
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:29,384
(woman sobbing)

249
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:38,310
Her name is Katya.

250
00:11:38,312 --> 00:11:41,813
She came to the U.S.
to work as a prostitute.

251
00:11:41,815 --> 00:11:44,933
Her handlers sold her to Julian
Walsh a couple of weeks ago.

252
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:49,354
She told me that he has been
to see her every night

253
00:11:49,356 --> 00:11:50,522
since he purchased her.

254
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:53,241
You can fill in
the blanks.

255
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:55,059
Most evenings,
he slept in her room.

256
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:57,028
Including last night.

257
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,831
Walsh's sex slave is his alibi
for the Myrose killings?

258
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,116
I'm afraid it
looks that way.

259
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:02,584
Respectfully,
I suggest that

260
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:04,285
we bring everyone
on the task force

261
00:12:04,287 --> 00:12:06,738
into a comprehensive review
of the original files.

262
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,123
Because of the shoe thing?

263
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,624
I'm not diverting
an entire task force

264
00:12:09,626 --> 00:12:11,409
for a missing high heel.

265
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:12,910
Four missing high heels,

266
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:15,296
if you count the
original crime scene.

267
00:12:15,298 --> 00:12:17,716
You never recovered the original
murder weapon, did you?

268
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:20,468
No, Crewes said he dumped it
in the East River.

269
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,920
Well, let's go and see
if he was telling the truth.

270
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:24,656
(siren whoops)

271
00:12:24,658 --> 00:12:26,124
GREGSON:
<i>Holmes,</i>

272
00:12:26,126 --> 00:12:27,425
what are we doing
down here?

273
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:29,194
Ballistics comparison, hmm?

274
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:32,764
This is the original report
from the original murders.

275
00:12:32,766 --> 00:12:34,733
BELL: You gonna
do it by eye?

276
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:37,235
The human eye
is a precision instrument.

277
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:40,605
It can detect
grooves and lands on a slug

278
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:43,491
more efficiently
than any computer.

279
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,077
In both of these killings,

280
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,879
and in last night's murders,
the slugs had

281
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:50,131
the same distinctive dent
on the case head.

282
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:52,884
It was caused by some sort of
defect in the gun's barrel.

283
00:12:52,886 --> 00:12:57,121
The grooves and lands show
a steep twist to the left.

284
00:12:57,123 --> 00:12:58,973
See for yourself.

285
00:13:01,143 --> 00:13:02,960
Now, you can wait
for the computers

286
00:13:02,962 --> 00:13:04,846
to confirm it
if you like,

287
00:13:04,848 --> 00:13:06,964
but Wade Crewes lied to you
about that murder weapon.

288
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:08,483
He didn't dump it.

289
00:13:08,485 --> 00:13:10,402
And wherever it's been
for the last 13 years,

290
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:12,937
it was used last night
to kill the Myroses.

291
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:16,524
This is no longer a theory,
Captain; this is a fact.

292
00:13:16,526 --> 00:13:19,327
These cases are
indelibly linked.

293
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:26,904
Terry?

294
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,439
What are you doing here?

295
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,724
I figured maybe
you could tell me that.

296
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,325
I got a message
saying to come here

297
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:32,660
to review the
Wade Crewes murders.

298
00:13:32,964 --> 00:13:34,080
I didn't call you.

299
00:13:34,082 --> 00:13:35,181
I did.

300
00:13:35,183 --> 00:13:36,799
Ms. D'Amico was your partner

301
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:38,801
when you investigated
the original murders in '99.

302
00:13:38,803 --> 00:13:40,753
Surely it's possible she
would help shed some light

303
00:13:40,755 --> 00:13:42,104
on the situation.

304
00:13:42,106 --> 00:13:43,723
We know that
last night's murders

305
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:46,058
were connected
to the ones from 1999.

306
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,527
The way I see it, this can mean
one of two things:

307
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:50,730
First is that Wade Crewes
had an accomplice

308
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:52,281
that he never told
the police about.

309
00:13:52,283 --> 00:13:53,899
For whatever
reason, that guy

310
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:55,785
started up again
13 years later.

311
00:13:55,787 --> 00:13:57,486
Second option:

312
00:13:57,488 --> 00:13:59,739
Crewes committed the original
crimes all by himself,

313
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:01,574
but got someone to do
last night's killing

314
00:14:01,576 --> 00:14:04,043
so he could maybe get
his sentence commuted.

315
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:05,611
There is another possibility:

316
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:07,997
Wade Crewes is innocent,
the wrong man is in prison

317
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:09,715
and the original killer
is back at it.

318
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:11,000
D'AMICO (laughing):
No way.

319
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:13,252
Crewes did it;
he told us he did it.

320
00:14:13,254 --> 00:14:15,037
It wouldn't be the first
false confession in the annals

321
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,305
of crime, would it?
GREGSON: Enough.

322
00:14:16,307 --> 00:14:17,890
This isn't philosophy class.

323
00:14:17,892 --> 00:14:21,093
We don't need to debate
every possibility.

324
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:24,797
Whatever's going on, I guarantee
you Crewes is not innocent.

325
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:28,123
Now, I'm going
to go talk to him,

326
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,558
see if I can shake his tree,

327
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,260
figure out if
he's working with somebody.

328
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:33,729
Garrity, Ramberg, I want you
to grab a couple of guys

329
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:35,931
and start digging
into some old case files.

330
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:38,267
Bell, I want you to look
into the suspects from '99.

331
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:40,519
All right?
We're done here.

332
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,412
Um, I'd like to go with
you to interview Crewes.

333
00:14:50,414 --> 00:14:52,164
Fine.
You can observe.

334
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,249
Um, not to pry, but
did everything end well

335
00:14:54,251 --> 00:14:55,868
with you and
Detective D'Amico?

336
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,369
I noticed that you didn't
greet each other,

337
00:14:57,371 --> 00:14:58,954
you didn't say
good-bye...

338
00:14:58,956 --> 00:15:01,456
You just got done dissecting
one of my old cases

339
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,992
in front of a room
full of people.

340
00:15:03,994 --> 00:15:07,045
How about you leave
my old partnership alone.

341
00:15:08,431 --> 00:15:12,167
You want insights
into Sherlock Holmes?

342
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:13,468
I'll give you an insight:

343
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,938
He's childish and self-absorbed.

344
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,341
He spent nearly every group
session in total silence.

345
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:20,893
He was, bar none,

346
00:15:20,895 --> 00:15:22,611
the least cooperative patient
I've ever had.

347
00:15:22,613 --> 00:15:26,648
Yeah, I read the same
from most of your colleagues.

348
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:29,517
Who's that?

349
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,537
Oh, the gardener.

350
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:34,623
Uh, I think his
name's E... Edson.

351
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,325
Edison?

352
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:38,693
Why?

353
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:40,495
WATSON:
Hey, there.

354
00:15:40,497 --> 00:15:41,997
How you doing?

355
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:43,215
Good.

356
00:15:43,217 --> 00:15:45,133
Hey, is that
beekeeping equipment?

357
00:15:45,135 --> 00:15:46,501
Yeah.

358
00:15:46,503 --> 00:15:48,303
Calms them down.

359
00:15:48,305 --> 00:15:50,806
Everyone tells me
I probably should

360
00:15:50,808 --> 00:15:52,391
just spray the hives
with poison,

361
00:15:52,393 --> 00:15:55,928
but what can I say?
I find them interesting.

362
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,230
This one's getting
a little big, though.

363
00:15:58,232 --> 00:16:01,433
Gonna move it out to the woods.

364
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:03,769
There was a client back here
a little while ago, uh,

365
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:05,720
who was also interested
in beekeeping.

366
00:16:05,722 --> 00:16:07,406
Sure.

367
00:16:07,408 --> 00:16:08,607
You mean Sherlock.

368
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:10,325
Yeah.
You knew him?

369
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:12,694
He used to tell me I was
the only person in this place

370
00:16:12,696 --> 00:16:13,862
without an agenda.

371
00:16:13,864 --> 00:16:15,897
I took that to mean
he liked me.

372
00:16:17,283 --> 00:16:18,733
CREWES: <i>I wasn't sure</i>
<i>if you and your partner</i>

373
00:16:18,735 --> 00:16:19,785
<i>would show up here.</i>

374
00:16:19,787 --> 00:16:21,236
You were expecting us?

375
00:16:21,238 --> 00:16:22,621
Of course.

376
00:16:22,623 --> 00:16:24,572
We get the newspapers
in here, Detective.

377
00:16:24,574 --> 00:16:25,841
Oh-- wait a minute.

378
00:16:25,843 --> 00:16:27,676
It's Captain now, isn't it?

379
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:31,179
I read about last
night's murders.

380
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:33,098
I knew you'd come see me.

381
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,749
Then I'll cut
right to the chase:

382
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:36,885
What's the name of the guy
you're working with?

383
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:39,771
I gave up anger
a long time ago.

384
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:42,557
It was one of
the only rational responses

385
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,477
to the irrational situation
my life had become.

386
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:49,364
But you, standing there,
accusing me...

387
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:52,600
I think that's the perfect test
for my progress, isn't it?

388
00:16:52,602 --> 00:16:55,037
What, exactly, do you have
to be angry about?

389
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,706
As we both well know,
I'm an innocent man.

390
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,742
I spent years thinking
about how to prove it,

391
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:02,911
and when I finally
gave up the quest,

392
00:17:02,913 --> 00:17:05,464
the world decided
to prove it for me.

393
00:17:05,466 --> 00:17:07,332
It's like the man says:

394
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:11,119
"The strongest of all warriors
are these two:

395
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:13,055
Time and Patience."

396
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:15,140
Tolstoy's <i>War and Peace.</i>

397
00:17:15,142 --> 00:17:17,042
Your file says
you were

398
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:20,095
functionally illiterate when
you confessed to the murders.

399
00:17:20,097 --> 00:17:23,065
I had plenty
of raw intelligence.

400
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:25,400
What I didn't have were
parents or a school system

401
00:17:25,402 --> 00:17:26,685
that gave a damn about me.

402
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:29,521
And my confession,
well, I gave that

403
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:31,857
after my Legal Aid lawyer
convinced me

404
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:34,409
it was the only way of avoiding
a guaranteed life sentence.

405
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:36,461
He wouldn't take the time
to prove my alibi.

406
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:37,696
GREGSON:
Carla Figueroa?

407
00:17:37,698 --> 00:17:39,081
Please.

408
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,982
She recanted
the second we asked her

409
00:17:40,984 --> 00:17:42,751
to make an
official statement.

410
00:17:42,753 --> 00:17:44,786
Well, of course she did!
Carla was married!

411
00:17:44,788 --> 00:17:46,872
If she admitted she was with me
during the murders, well,

412
00:17:46,874 --> 00:17:48,490
that would be the end
of that, wouldn't it?

413
00:17:48,492 --> 00:17:51,460
We found your fingerprints
at the scene

414
00:17:51,462 --> 00:17:54,679
of the third murders
in '99, remember?

415
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:57,099
You mean you put my prints

416
00:17:57,101 --> 00:18:00,635
at the scene
of the third murders in 1999.

417
00:18:00,637 --> 00:18:03,838
You and I both know that
evidence was planted.

418
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,309
Worked out pretty well for you,
didn't it, Captain?

419
00:18:08,361 --> 00:18:11,730
I'm not even
going to respond to that.

420
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:14,015
The next time you and I
speak to each other,

421
00:18:14,017 --> 00:18:16,651
we'll be standing
on the courthouse steps,

422
00:18:16,653 --> 00:18:20,705
after I'm exonerated of
every charge against me.

423
00:18:26,295 --> 00:18:27,996
I know he values
his privacy,

424
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:29,831
but there are some things that
Sherlock needs to deal with,

425
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,333
if he really wants
to get better.

426
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:32,367
Are there?

427
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:34,002
Can you just tell me--

428
00:18:34,004 --> 00:18:36,371
did he ever mention
a woman named Irene?

429
00:18:36,373 --> 00:18:38,557
Can't say he did.

430
00:18:40,643 --> 00:18:43,044
Thank you very much
for your time.

431
00:18:46,182 --> 00:18:49,734
The name does sound
familiar, though.

432
00:18:51,387 --> 00:18:55,557
He left some things behind--
personal stuff.

433
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:00,112
I held onto it all, just in case
he ever came back for it.

434
00:19:02,698 --> 00:19:05,233
Maybe you can give
these back to him.

435
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:13,842
GREGSON: 1020 31st Avenue,
Astoria, Queens.

436
00:19:13,844 --> 00:19:15,544
You want to tell me
why we're here?

437
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:18,079
Last known address
of Carla Figueroa.

438
00:19:18,081 --> 00:19:19,931
I thought we could have
a quick word with her,

439
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:21,349
see if there's anything
to the notion

440
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:23,251
that she recanted
Wade Crewes's alibi

441
00:19:23,253 --> 00:19:25,604
to save her marriage.

442
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:27,189
I'm just being thorough.

443
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:29,558
Go right ahead;
I'm just telling you,

444
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,393
I'm not gonna be here
when you get back.

445
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:34,229
Why are you so unwilling to even
consider the possibility

446
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:35,564
that Crewes is innocent?

447
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:36,898
Is it pride?

448
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,401
Because I worked
the case; you didn't.

449
00:19:39,403 --> 00:19:41,620
That's precisely why my input
is so valuable.

450
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:44,039
We put Crewes away
on good evidence.

451
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:46,608
His fingerprints were all
over a mug that got broken,

452
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,411
while he was killing
his last two victims.

453
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:51,413
The same mug that he
accused you of planting.

454
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:52,631
Now, when he said that,

455
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:54,132
you swallowed twice
before responding,

456
00:19:54,134 --> 00:19:56,618
like you were trying
to clear your throat, hmm?

457
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,086
And when you
did answer him,

458
00:19:58,088 --> 00:19:59,754
your vocal intonation
was markedly different.

459
00:19:59,756 --> 00:20:01,223
Now, if I wasn't
watching you,

460
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:03,124
someone I have
the highest respect for,

461
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:05,260
I would think that that was
the response of someone

462
00:20:05,262 --> 00:20:07,429
with something to hide.

463
00:20:08,481 --> 00:20:10,932
It sounds like you
think that anyway.

464
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:12,817
(tapping on car)
My dad's gonna go ape

465
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:14,319
when he sees you guys
parked in our driveway.

466
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:15,637
Just saying.

467
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:17,138
We're not going to leave
the car here;

468
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,306
we're with the police.

469
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:20,075
We need to speak
with Carla Figueroa.

470
00:20:20,077 --> 00:20:23,945
Uh, my mom died
four years ago.

471
00:20:23,947 --> 00:20:25,697
Leukemia.

472
00:20:25,699 --> 00:20:27,916
Oh, I'm so sorry
to hear that.

473
00:20:27,918 --> 00:20:29,951
My dad's inside, if you
want to talk to him.

474
00:20:29,953 --> 00:20:32,003
No, no, no.
It had to be her.

475
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:33,505
Uh... thanks.

476
00:20:33,507 --> 00:20:34,956
Sorry to bother you.

477
00:20:37,126 --> 00:20:41,146
HOLMES: Well, if she was lying,
her secret died with her.

478
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:43,715
She wasn't lying.

479
00:20:43,717 --> 00:20:46,935
Oh, Wade Crewes,
he put on a good show.

480
00:20:46,937 --> 00:20:48,637
Oh, I'll give him that.

481
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:51,223
But if you really want to
know why I won't waste time

482
00:20:51,225 --> 00:20:53,525
trying to find out if
Wade Crewes is innocent,

483
00:20:53,527 --> 00:20:54,676
watch the tapes.

484
00:20:54,678 --> 00:20:56,278
He held his tongue,

485
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,013
but he couldn't help
gloating about it.

486
00:20:59,015 --> 00:21:02,317
That's the real Wade Crewes.

487
00:21:04,153 --> 00:21:06,204
(starts engine)

488
00:21:06,206 --> 00:21:08,573
GREGSON (on tape): You were
dressed like a house painter.

489
00:21:10,126 --> 00:21:12,160
CREWES (on tape):
Eh, doesn't ring a bell.

490
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:15,196
Maybe I should take a look at
those crime scene photos again.

491
00:21:15,198 --> 00:21:17,632
Might jar my memory.

492
00:21:17,634 --> 00:21:20,051
(door opens, shuts)

493
00:21:20,053 --> 00:21:21,720
(footsteps approaching)

494
00:21:21,722 --> 00:21:23,638
Surprised I didn't
see you today, Watson.

495
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,725
I sent you a text with my exact
location every two hours.

496
00:21:26,727 --> 00:21:28,093
I was busy.

497
00:21:28,095 --> 00:21:29,711
I left some urine
in your room.

498
00:21:29,713 --> 00:21:32,714
Tell me it's in a cup.

499
00:21:32,716 --> 00:21:35,883
(video continues indistinctly)

500
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:57,238
D'AMICO (on tape):
Today is April 3, 1999,

501
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,258
and the time is 2200 hours.

502
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,093
I'm interviewing Wade Crewes

503
00:22:02,095 --> 00:22:06,247
in connection with the deaths
of David and Lyla Dawson.

504
00:22:06,249 --> 00:22:08,583
CREWES:
So, where do we start?

505
00:22:08,585 --> 00:22:10,852
D'AMICO:
How about with the fact

506
00:22:10,854 --> 00:22:13,305
that you used to deliver pizzas
to the Dawsons

507
00:22:13,307 --> 00:22:15,440
back when you were
holding down a job?

508
00:22:15,442 --> 00:22:18,560
Is that how
you scouted them out?

509
00:22:21,781 --> 00:22:25,433
Black, just like you asked for.

510
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:28,903
Cheers.

511
00:22:36,212 --> 00:22:37,912
(knocking)

512
00:22:37,914 --> 00:22:40,248
We're putting our differences
aside. Come downstairs.

513
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,966
If you need my help,
you know I'm game,

514
00:22:41,968 --> 00:22:43,752
but if this is
some sort of prank...

515
00:22:43,754 --> 00:22:45,887
Watson, I think I've learned
something, and if I'm right,

516
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:48,256
it is bigger than any
dispute between you and me.

517
00:22:48,258 --> 00:22:49,891
It has a moral component.

518
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:52,894
You're good with
that sort of thing.

519
00:22:52,896 --> 00:22:54,396
In the first interrogation
of Wade Crewes,

520
00:22:54,398 --> 00:22:56,981
they served him his coffee
in a disposable cup.

521
00:22:56,983 --> 00:22:58,400
In the second
interrogation,

522
00:22:58,402 --> 00:23:00,068
they served it to
him in that mug.

523
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,770
Black with a white
stripe around the rim.

524
00:23:01,772 --> 00:23:03,571
The second interrogation
took place

525
00:23:03,573 --> 00:23:05,306
shortly after the
second pair of murders.

526
00:23:05,308 --> 00:23:08,326
At the third crime scene,
they found physical evidence

527
00:23:08,328 --> 00:23:10,111
that implicated Wade Crewes.

528
00:23:10,113 --> 00:23:13,981
A fingerprint
on a shattered mug.

529
00:23:13,983 --> 00:23:18,653
Black with a white stripe
around the rim.

530
00:23:18,655 --> 00:23:21,339
My God, it's
the same mug.

531
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:23,124
The evidence was planted,

532
00:23:23,126 --> 00:23:26,711
and it was Captain Gregson
who gave him that mug.

533
00:23:38,806 --> 00:23:40,151
I've been struggling
with something.

534
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:42,353
Oh, good morning
to you, too.

535
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:44,623
Why did you tell me
to look at the tape?

536
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,207
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't notice?

537
00:23:46,209 --> 00:23:47,742
The mug.

538
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:49,377
The one that you
handed to Wade Crewes

539
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:50,879
during your second
interrogation of him.

540
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:52,864
It's the same one
that your men

541
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:54,749
found at the
third crime scene.

542
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,174
I want you to
understand,

543
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:05,810
I take no pleasure in
pursuing this line of inquiry,

544
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:07,896
but I am obliged to
pursue the facts,

545
00:24:07,898 --> 00:24:10,148
and the facts are you
and Detective D'Amico

546
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,317
had possession of that
mug before it showed up

547
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,885
at the third crime scene.

548
00:24:15,738 --> 00:24:19,223
As I said yesterday, I have
the utmost respect for you.

549
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:20,992
If evidence was planted,

550
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:23,745
I'm sure it was the
result of frustration.

551
00:24:23,747 --> 00:24:26,197
A mistake that the
perpetrator or perpetrators

552
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:27,949
would no doubt
wish to take back

553
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:29,834
especially now that
it seems possible

554
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:34,289
that Mr. Crewes may
well be innocent.

555
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,241
I don't want to...

556
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:39,461
You know that I will
find out the truth

557
00:24:39,463 --> 00:24:43,748
and the truth may well
be... just compromising.

558
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,685
Every cop gets offered
a few perks.

559
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:48,937
Free lunch here,
gym membership there.

560
00:24:48,939 --> 00:24:51,940
I never took a single one,

561
00:24:51,942 --> 00:24:55,860
and I sure as hell
never planted evidence.

562
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:58,813
Well, then, could you
or your former partner

563
00:24:58,815 --> 00:25:00,365
please explain to
me how that mug

564
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:01,783
showed up at the
crime scene?

565
00:25:17,094 --> 00:25:19,128
Hey.

566
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,880
How'd it go?

567
00:25:20,882 --> 00:25:23,183
Captain Gregson got
the warning he deserved.

568
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:24,750
Now to solve the case.

569
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:27,720
Hold on, I...
I've got something for you.

570
00:25:32,776 --> 00:25:34,594
You've been to Hemdale.

571
00:25:34,596 --> 00:25:36,479
Edson saved them for you.

572
00:25:36,481 --> 00:25:39,232
And were they everything
that you hoped, hmm?

573
00:25:39,234 --> 00:25:41,734
Do you understand me now?

574
00:25:41,736 --> 00:25:43,536
I didn't read them.

575
00:25:43,538 --> 00:25:44,954
I was tempted.

576
00:25:44,956 --> 00:25:46,739
They're from Irene;
how could I not be?

577
00:25:46,741 --> 00:25:48,241
But whatever happened,
this is not

578
00:25:48,243 --> 00:25:49,876
how I want
to find out about it.

579
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:51,444
A show of restraint.
When...

580
00:25:51,446 --> 00:25:53,613
(sighs)

581
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:55,548
If you are ready
to talk about it,

582
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,834
I'd very much like to know,

583
00:25:57,836 --> 00:25:59,668
but I'm not going to ask you
about it anymore.

584
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:01,401
I just thought
you might want these.

585
00:26:01,403 --> 00:26:03,070
Indeed I do.

586
00:26:03,072 --> 00:26:05,255
Thank you, Watson.

587
00:26:13,465 --> 00:26:15,549
Hey, what are you doing?

588
00:26:15,551 --> 00:26:17,851
I left those at Hemdale
because I didn't want them.

589
00:26:17,853 --> 00:26:19,386
I don't understand.
Aren't those important?

590
00:26:19,388 --> 00:26:21,055
Remember your promise:
no further discussion

591
00:26:21,057 --> 00:26:23,023
of this matter
until I bring it up.

592
00:26:23,025 --> 00:26:24,810
Fine. Fine.

593
00:26:26,012 --> 00:26:28,733
(Sighs ) You mentioned something
about a case that needs solving.

594
00:26:30,565 --> 00:26:32,199
This is Victor Nardin.

595
00:26:32,201 --> 00:26:34,434
He was an early suspect
in the '99 home invasions.

596
00:26:34,436 --> 00:26:36,403
He's been in prison
for the last 12 years,

597
00:26:36,405 --> 00:26:38,539
which could explain why the home
invasions miraculously stopped.

598
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:40,607
He was released
three weeks ago,

599
00:26:40,609 --> 00:26:42,292
which could explain
why they've resumed.

600
00:26:42,294 --> 00:26:44,795
How are the police
not looking for this guy?

601
00:26:44,797 --> 00:26:46,630
They are; they just
can't find him.

602
00:26:46,632 --> 00:26:49,833
Nardin left his group home on
Staten Island two weeks ago

603
00:26:49,835 --> 00:26:51,952
and has not checked in
with his parole officer.

604
00:26:51,954 --> 00:26:53,554
Those letters are Cyrillic.

605
00:26:53,556 --> 00:26:55,055
Is he in a gang or something?

606
00:26:55,057 --> 00:26:57,091
No, rabid
football fan.

607
00:26:57,093 --> 00:26:59,309
The tattoos
are the names

608
00:26:59,311 --> 00:27:01,762
and jersey numbers
of famous players

609
00:27:01,764 --> 00:27:03,130
from Terek Grozny.

610
00:27:03,132 --> 00:27:05,249
It is Chechnya's
premier football club.

611
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:07,434
And how are they gonna help us
find Victor Nardin?

612
00:27:07,436 --> 00:27:09,820
I believe they
already have.

613
00:27:09,822 --> 00:27:12,523
Nardin has spent a
decade in prison,

614
00:27:12,525 --> 00:27:14,641
bereft of his
favorite obsession.

615
00:27:14,643 --> 00:27:18,028
Wherever he is, he will want
to watch his beloved team.

616
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,781
There aren't that
many bars in New York

617
00:27:20,783 --> 00:27:24,001
that have a satellite
feed of Chechen football.

618
00:27:24,003 --> 00:27:25,753
Three, actually.

619
00:27:25,755 --> 00:27:27,905
All of them
in Brighton Beach.

620
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:31,442
All of them within walking
distance of Mayweather Hotel.

621
00:27:31,444 --> 00:27:32,776
"Rooms by the hour,

622
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:35,012
week or month. Cash only."

623
00:27:39,684 --> 00:27:41,385
(American accent):
Yeah. I got a delivery

624
00:27:41,387 --> 00:27:43,137
for one of your guests.
I need a room number.

625
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:44,504
Victor Nardin.

626
00:27:45,523 --> 00:27:47,507
No Nardin?

627
00:27:47,509 --> 00:27:49,359
Hold... hold on.

628
00:27:49,361 --> 00:27:51,695
Oh, no, no.

629
00:27:51,697 --> 00:27:52,813
I got the wrong name.

630
00:27:52,815 --> 00:27:55,866
Victor Jones.

631
00:27:55,868 --> 00:27:58,852
282. Thank you.

632
00:28:09,214 --> 00:28:11,381
Hey.

633
00:28:13,918 --> 00:28:15,469
What gives?

634
00:28:15,471 --> 00:28:18,472
Tommy, we can't just talk
at the precinct?

635
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:20,057
Not about this.

636
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:23,376
You planted that
mug, didn't you?

637
00:28:23,378 --> 00:28:25,429
Yeah.

638
00:28:25,431 --> 00:28:29,099
We knew it was him, but
we couldn't nail him.

639
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:31,652
So, after the second time
you brought him in,

640
00:28:31,654 --> 00:28:33,553
you kept that mug

641
00:28:33,555 --> 00:28:35,022
just in case.

642
00:28:35,024 --> 00:28:37,407
Good to have a trump card, huh?

643
00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:39,409
I always assumed you knew that.

644
00:28:39,411 --> 00:28:41,361
I knew it was convenient,

645
00:28:41,363 --> 00:28:43,396
piece of evidence
to turn up like that.

646
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:45,249
I chalked it up
to our good fortune

647
00:28:45,251 --> 00:28:46,659
because I thought
we had our guy.

648
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:47,619
We did.

649
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,704
Well, I was a lot more sure
about that then than I am now.

650
00:28:50,706 --> 00:28:52,956
'Cause somebody is out
there killing people

651
00:28:52,958 --> 00:28:55,259
with the same
murder weapon, Terry.

652
00:28:56,577 --> 00:28:58,095
What if we were wrong?

653
00:28:58,097 --> 00:29:00,914
If that were true--
and that is still a big "if"

654
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:03,267
as far as I'm concerned--
there are ways around that.

655
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:06,053
Whoa, I'm not here
to plan a cover-up.

656
00:29:06,055 --> 00:29:08,522
If we put an
innocent man in jail,

657
00:29:08,524 --> 00:29:10,224
I'm not keeping quiet about it.

658
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:11,692
All right,
let's just forget

659
00:29:11,694 --> 00:29:14,361
about the fact
that I could go to jail.

660
00:29:14,363 --> 00:29:17,097
You worked that
task force in '99.

661
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:19,233
How do you think that's
going to play for your career?

662
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:20,651
I'll be done; doesn't matter.

663
00:29:20,653 --> 00:29:22,769
If I let this
happen on my watch,

664
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:24,321
I'm owning up to it.

665
00:29:24,323 --> 00:29:25,873
(phone ringing)

666
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:28,792
Fair warning, partner.

667
00:29:29,878 --> 00:29:32,162
Mr. Jones?

668
00:29:32,164 --> 00:29:34,748
Mr. Jones,
(coughs) you have a message

669
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,050
from the front desk.

670
00:29:37,052 --> 00:29:39,136
He's not here.

671
00:29:39,138 --> 00:29:41,788
If I lived here, I
wouldn't be here, either.

672
00:29:43,474 --> 00:29:47,811
Um, should I ask why we're
not calling the police?

673
00:29:47,813 --> 00:29:49,763
I found the man.

674
00:29:49,765 --> 00:29:52,983
I just... I just want to have
a look around.

675
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,144
(groans)

676
00:30:04,146 --> 00:30:06,113
I don't believe it,
but this place smells worse

677
00:30:06,115 --> 00:30:07,948
than the outside.

678
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,533
Stale cigarette smoke,

679
00:30:09,535 --> 00:30:11,702
cheap cologne,

680
00:30:11,704 --> 00:30:14,321
a whiff of
existential despair.

681
00:30:16,507 --> 00:30:18,675
This floor is sticky.

682
00:30:24,332 --> 00:30:27,217
(sniffing)

683
00:30:27,219 --> 00:30:30,687
Evidently, Mr. Nardin
has a drinking problem.

684
00:30:30,689 --> 00:30:33,190
He spills his orange juice.

685
00:30:57,382 --> 00:30:59,383
Ah.

686
00:30:59,385 --> 00:31:01,335
What?

687
00:31:01,337 --> 00:31:04,221
The carpet has come loose
from the floorboards here.

688
00:31:04,223 --> 00:31:05,639
It hasn't come loose from age.

689
00:31:05,641 --> 00:31:07,841
Someone has pried this up.

690
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:12,396
(coughing)

691
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,215
(phone ringing)

692
00:31:32,217 --> 00:31:33,917
Just a minute.

693
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,902
(sighs)

694
00:31:35,904 --> 00:31:38,288
Oh. (chuckles)

695
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,507
Captain.

696
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:42,876
I need you right away.
It's happened again.

697
00:31:42,878 --> 00:31:45,679
A triple this time.

698
00:31:45,681 --> 00:31:48,932
Neighbor spotted the
body through a window.

699
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:50,717
I'll be right there.

700
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:53,020
And, Captain,

701
00:31:53,022 --> 00:31:55,639
I think I might be able
to tell you

702
00:31:55,641 --> 00:31:57,974
where the murder weapon is.

703
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:04,207
The homeowners were
Michael and Elizabeth Willis.

704
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:06,071
Everything about
their deaths

705
00:32:06,073 --> 00:32:08,456
is consistent
with the others.

706
00:32:08,458 --> 00:32:09,908
And the third body?

707
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,443
Houseguest, Garret Ames.

708
00:32:11,445 --> 00:32:13,395
I don't think the attacker
knew he was here.

709
00:32:13,397 --> 00:32:15,480
After the Willises
were shot,

710
00:32:15,482 --> 00:32:18,516
there was
a struggle here,

711
00:32:18,518 --> 00:32:20,335
and Ames was trying
to get away.

712
00:32:20,337 --> 00:32:22,037
Almost made it, too.

713
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:24,923
Killer shot him
from right here.

714
00:32:24,925 --> 00:32:27,892
(sighs)

715
00:32:27,894 --> 00:32:30,461
Add another three
to the tally.

716
00:32:30,463 --> 00:32:32,130
That's all right,
Captain.

717
00:32:32,132 --> 00:32:33,965
I know this
is difficult.

718
00:32:33,967 --> 00:32:36,234
Well, at least CSU
gave us some evidence.

719
00:32:36,236 --> 00:32:37,652
They picked up
some cigarette butts

720
00:32:37,654 --> 00:32:39,020
from across the street.

721
00:32:39,022 --> 00:32:41,022
Neighbors saw
someone smoking.

722
00:32:41,024 --> 00:32:42,741
They're checking
the place out.

723
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:45,660
Hopefully we'll be able
to harvest some DNA.

724
00:32:45,662 --> 00:32:47,362
We put a BOLO out
for Victor Nardin,

725
00:32:47,364 --> 00:32:49,313
and we got a warrant
for his hotel room.

726
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:51,833
If the gun you saw
is the murder weapon,

727
00:32:51,835 --> 00:32:53,118
it's beginning

728
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,954
to look like an
open-and-shut case.

729
00:32:55,956 --> 00:32:57,872
What is it?

730
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:04,512
You said the killer
shot the houseguest from here.

731
00:33:04,514 --> 00:33:06,965
Yeah?
Yeah.

732
00:33:09,168 --> 00:33:11,686
Listen, I know you got your
theories about what happened,

733
00:33:11,688 --> 00:33:14,889
but I just want you to know
that if Wade Crewes is innocent,

734
00:33:14,891 --> 00:33:16,558
I'm not going to hide from that.

735
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,528
Yeah. Sorry, Captain,
could you just give me a minute?

736
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,365
I'm trying to tell you
something important here.

737
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:25,850
Yes, but I wouldn't fall
on my sword just yet.

738
00:33:25,852 --> 00:33:27,452
(phone ringing)

739
00:33:29,688 --> 00:33:31,456
Gregson.

740
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:35,710
Really?

741
00:33:35,712 --> 00:33:36,945
Yeah?

742
00:33:36,947 --> 00:33:39,130
Okay, yeah.

743
00:33:39,132 --> 00:33:40,882
That was Bell.

744
00:33:40,884 --> 00:33:44,069
Nardin returned
to his hotel room.

745
00:33:44,071 --> 00:33:45,303
We've got him in custody.

746
00:33:45,305 --> 00:33:47,138
Excellent.

747
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,508
That should make it easier to
confirm that he didn't do this.

748
00:33:52,678 --> 00:33:55,146
I didn't kill those
people, okay?

749
00:33:55,148 --> 00:33:57,599
Victor Nardin, think fast.

750
00:33:57,601 --> 00:33:59,100
What are you doing?

751
00:33:59,102 --> 00:34:00,368
This man is innocent.

752
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,103
Detective Bell,
a word, if you please?

753
00:34:02,105 --> 00:34:03,321
Why'd he hit me?

754
00:34:03,323 --> 00:34:05,573
Hey, stay right there.

755
00:34:05,575 --> 00:34:08,109
Wait, wait, wait. You assault
our perp with an orange?

756
00:34:08,111 --> 00:34:10,195
And that somehow has you
convinced he's innocent?

757
00:34:10,197 --> 00:34:12,280
I was testing a hypothesis
I began to form

758
00:34:12,282 --> 00:34:14,065
back in Victor Nardin's
hotel room.

759
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:15,667
It was odd.

760
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:17,001
Everything was
out of alignment.

761
00:34:17,003 --> 00:34:18,770
<i>All his toiletries lined up</i>

762
00:34:18,772 --> 00:34:20,255
on the left-hand side.

763
00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:22,406
The same was true of
his bedside table, his desk.

764
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:25,293
So he favors his left side.
Big deal.

765
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:28,246
Agreed. Out of context,
it's an utterly mundane detail.

766
00:34:28,248 --> 00:34:30,381
But there were these
distinctive blue marks

767
00:34:30,383 --> 00:34:31,966
on the ceiling
above Nardin's bed.

768
00:34:31,968 --> 00:34:33,301
The kind of marks

769
00:34:33,303 --> 00:34:34,719
<i>a racquetball might make</i>

770
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:36,905
<i>if it was thrown</i>
<i>repeatedly upwards.</i>

771
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:39,090
It's a common exercise
to strengthen depth perception.

772
00:34:39,092 --> 00:34:40,925
The kind of thing
that you might do

773
00:34:40,927 --> 00:34:42,727
if you were...
Monocular.

774
00:34:42,729 --> 00:34:44,779
You're saying
that he was blind in one eye?

775
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:46,564
In his right eye.

776
00:34:46,566 --> 00:34:49,451
He's learning depth perception.

777
00:34:49,453 --> 00:34:52,070
The man can hardly even pour
his orange juice accurately,

778
00:34:52,072 --> 00:34:54,906
let alone hit a moving target
at 20 feet.

779
00:34:54,908 --> 00:34:57,041
If he's right,
it would be hard to pull off.

780
00:34:57,043 --> 00:34:58,576
In the dark,
with adrenaline

781
00:34:58,578 --> 00:35:00,211
coursing through your
system after a fight,

782
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:01,496
I'd say it was impossible.

783
00:35:01,498 --> 00:35:04,048
But... we've got evidence.

784
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,449
The murder weapon,
the cigarettes...

785
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:07,919
The cigarettes were planted,
obviously.

786
00:35:07,921 --> 00:35:09,838
You're standing on a street and
you want to put out a cigarette,

787
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,589
how do you do it?
You drop it on the floor.

788
00:35:11,591 --> 00:35:13,174
You stand on it.
You flatten it.

789
00:35:13,176 --> 00:35:14,526
<i>The cigarettes that we found</i>
<i>at the crime scene</i>

790
00:35:14,528 --> 00:35:15,927
<i>had been ground out.</i>

791
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:17,929
Victor Nardin put them out
in an ashtray.

792
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:19,463
Someone took them
from his hotel room,

793
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:21,232
transported them
to the crime scene,

794
00:35:21,234 --> 00:35:23,485
and they put the gun beneath the
floorboards before they left.

795
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:26,271
Oh, so now Nardin's
been framed, too.

796
00:35:26,273 --> 00:35:27,638
I think that's a fair question.

797
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,274
The only obvious culprit

798
00:35:29,276 --> 00:35:31,142
would be the one man
who stood to benefit

799
00:35:31,144 --> 00:35:33,194
from someone else being
implicated in the crimes.

800
00:35:33,196 --> 00:35:36,364
Wade Crewes, working in tandem
with someone on the outside.

801
00:35:36,366 --> 00:35:37,648
Someone with
whom he shared

802
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,650
the location
of the murder weapon,

803
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:41,819
the details
of the murders in '99.

804
00:35:41,821 --> 00:35:43,872
By law, he has access
to his case files.

805
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:46,424
He could see a list of suspects,
pick a man to frame.

806
00:35:46,426 --> 00:35:47,926
You've spent the past 72 hours

807
00:35:47,928 --> 00:35:49,544
insisting Crewes is innocent.

808
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:51,179
I've been insisting that
there's a connection.

809
00:35:51,181 --> 00:35:52,547
And I'm right.

810
00:35:52,549 --> 00:35:54,849
The framing of Nardin
is the final stroke

811
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:58,052
in a plan that leads to
Wade Crewes walking free.

812
00:35:58,054 --> 00:36:00,138
We've got five dead bodies.

813
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,824
Who would be willing to do that
for a guy like Crewes?

814
00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:05,560
I have no idea.

815
00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:07,412
Then you've got nothing.

816
00:36:07,414 --> 00:36:09,781
Believe me, no one
wants you to be right

817
00:36:09,783 --> 00:36:11,533
about this more than me.

818
00:36:11,535 --> 00:36:13,318
All you've done
is scare up

819
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,186
a bunch of
circumstantial evidence

820
00:36:15,188 --> 00:36:16,871
that might or might not mean

821
00:36:16,873 --> 00:36:19,357
Nardin's been framed
by Crewes' mystery partner.

822
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,708
And if you're right,

823
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,994
we better identify
that partner fast,

824
00:36:22,996 --> 00:36:24,629
'cause if we don't,

825
00:36:24,631 --> 00:36:26,464
Nardin's going to eat
these charges,

826
00:36:26,466 --> 00:36:28,716
and then Crewes walks.

827
00:36:28,718 --> 00:36:30,534
FEMALE REPORTER:
<i>The police commissioner</i>

828
00:36:30,536 --> 00:36:32,370
declined comment today
on the possibility

829
00:36:32,372 --> 00:36:34,639
that a pair of violent
home invasions

830
00:36:34,641 --> 00:36:37,108
may signal the innocence
of the notorious Wade Crewes.

831
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,542
According to
prison records,

832
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:40,245
Crewes hasn't had
a visitor in years.

833
00:36:40,247 --> 00:36:42,146
He hasn't sent a letter,
he hasn't received one.

834
00:36:42,148 --> 00:36:44,349
No phone calls, either.

835
00:36:45,717 --> 00:36:47,452
Maybe he's collaborating
with an old cellmate?

836
00:36:47,454 --> 00:36:49,237
Doubtful.

837
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:52,390
Crewes's one and only cellmate
is serving life without parole.

838
00:36:52,392 --> 00:36:53,858
Whoever he's working with,

839
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,660
he's willing to kill for him.

840
00:36:55,662 --> 00:36:58,896
This is no casual acquaintance.

841
00:36:58,898 --> 00:37:01,749
So have we been over all
of Crewes's relatives?

842
00:37:01,751 --> 00:37:03,618
Crewes was raised
in group homes.

843
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,169
He doesn't even know
his own parents.

844
00:37:05,171 --> 00:37:06,704
REPORTER: You seem remarkably calm
for someone

845
00:37:06,706 --> 00:37:08,590
who claims to have spent
13 years in jail

846
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:09,841
for crimes he didn't commit.

847
00:37:09,843 --> 00:37:11,926
"Things are what they are,

848
00:37:11,928 --> 00:37:14,162
and will be what they will be."

849
00:37:14,164 --> 00:37:16,848
Oscar Wilde.

850
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,466
What?

851
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:21,219
Crewes is quoting
Oscar Wilde.

852
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:23,521
When he went to prison,
he was illiterate.

853
00:37:23,523 --> 00:37:26,307
Now he quotes Wilde
and Tolstoy.

854
00:37:28,093 --> 00:37:29,777
He's not just reading.

855
00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:32,196
He's reading at
an advanced level.

856
00:37:32,198 --> 00:37:34,765
Records.

857
00:37:41,573 --> 00:37:45,410
Someone must have
taught him how to read.

858
00:37:46,778 --> 00:37:50,632
There is no record of
him taking any classes.

859
00:37:50,634 --> 00:37:52,300
Whoever taught him

860
00:37:52,302 --> 00:37:54,335
must have spent quite
a bit of time with him.

861
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:56,638
Lots of chats.
Time to plan.

862
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,256
You just said he
didn't take a class.

863
00:37:58,258 --> 00:37:59,557
But he did
have a job.

864
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:00,958
A couple of years ago,

865
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,311
he signed up to work
at the prison library.

866
00:38:03,313 --> 00:38:06,180
You think someone who worked
there taught him how to read?

867
00:38:06,182 --> 00:38:08,149
Maybe.

868
00:38:08,151 --> 00:38:11,102
I seem to remember
that the library at Sing Sing

869
00:38:11,104 --> 00:38:14,638
was on the verge of being
shut down a few years ago.

870
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:19,494
Yes. See?

871
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:20,828
It only stayed open

872
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,697
because a volunteer
advocacy group

873
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:26,284
agreed to fund the library
and keep it staffed.

874
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:34,709
"Literacy Initiative
for All"-- LIFA.

875
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:37,328
I've seen those initials
recently.

876
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:43,267
You know him?

877
00:38:45,337 --> 00:38:48,005
He's the son of
Carla Figueroa.

878
00:38:48,007 --> 00:38:51,075
The woman Crewes
had an affair with.

879
00:38:55,314 --> 00:38:56,698
HOLMES:
Sean Figueroa?

880
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,399
Yeah.

881
00:38:58,401 --> 00:38:59,984
You're that guy.

882
00:38:59,986 --> 00:39:01,285
From outside
my house, right?

883
00:39:01,287 --> 00:39:02,737
Yeah. Sherlock Holmes.

884
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:03,988
Consulting detective.

885
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,374
This is Mr. Bell,

886
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:08,993
frequent beneficiary
of said consultations.

887
00:39:08,995 --> 00:39:10,083
How can I help you?

888
00:39:10,108 --> 00:39:12,032
You ever wonder why you
have such blue eyes, Sean?

889
00:39:12,165 --> 00:39:13,464
You must have.

890
00:39:13,466 --> 00:39:15,583
Both of your parents
are of Mexican descent,

891
00:39:15,585 --> 00:39:19,003
yet there you are, eyes as blue
as the fjords of Norway.

892
00:39:19,005 --> 00:39:20,805
Why do you want to
know about my eyes?

893
00:39:20,807 --> 00:39:22,924
Because that's what first
led me to believe

894
00:39:22,926 --> 00:39:24,976
that Wade Crewes
is your father.

895
00:39:24,978 --> 00:39:26,594
I suppose I'm just
wondering if

896
00:39:26,596 --> 00:39:28,546
that's how you arrived
at the same conclusion.

897
00:39:28,548 --> 00:39:30,348
I don't know what
you're talking about,

898
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,150
but I'm busy, so...

899
00:39:32,152 --> 00:39:34,152
Your mother had a long-standing
affair with Crewes.

900
00:39:34,154 --> 00:39:36,320
I suppose, when she
fell pregnant with you,

901
00:39:36,322 --> 00:39:38,889
it was easy enough to pass
you off as your father's son.

902
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:40,408
But, uh...

903
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,059
can't imagine
she told you.

904
00:39:42,061 --> 00:39:44,162
You did find out, though.

905
00:39:44,164 --> 00:39:46,030
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have begun volunteering

906
00:39:46,032 --> 00:39:48,699
at the prison library,
where he works.

907
00:39:48,701 --> 00:39:51,035
Huh?

908
00:39:51,037 --> 00:39:52,837
You can lie
all you want, Sean.

909
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:54,439
It'll be easy enough
to establish paternity.

910
00:39:54,441 --> 00:39:55,873
Okay.

911
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:57,175
So what if he is my dad?

912
00:39:57,177 --> 00:39:58,709
How did you find out?

913
00:39:58,711 --> 00:40:00,744
My mom kept a diary.

914
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:02,630
My dad didn't know
where it was hidden,

915
00:40:02,632 --> 00:40:03,965
but I did.

916
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:05,767
After she died,
I read the whole thing.

917
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:07,101
You must have
been curious

918
00:40:07,103 --> 00:40:08,803
about your
real father, yeah.

919
00:40:08,805 --> 00:40:10,521
The notorious killer.

920
00:40:10,523 --> 00:40:13,691
So you volunteered.

921
00:40:13,693 --> 00:40:15,943
Probably just observed
for a while,

922
00:40:15,945 --> 00:40:18,362
then you struck up
a relationship.

923
00:40:18,364 --> 00:40:21,149
At some point,
you revealed the connection.

924
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:24,152
And that's when Crewes
went to work on you. Yeah?

925
00:40:24,154 --> 00:40:25,736
How long did it take him

926
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:27,872
to seduce you? Hmm?

927
00:40:27,874 --> 00:40:29,157
How long did it take him

928
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:31,325
to talk you into killing
on his behalf?

929
00:40:31,327 --> 00:40:32,627
I taught him how to read.

930
00:40:32,629 --> 00:40:34,295
That's how it
started, yeah.

931
00:40:34,297 --> 00:40:35,963
But there's more
than a little bit

932
00:40:35,965 --> 00:40:37,748
of your father in you,
isn't there, Sean?

933
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,333
Yeah.

934
00:40:39,335 --> 00:40:41,169
Enough for you
to murder five people.

935
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:42,670
You must know
your father

936
00:40:42,672 --> 00:40:43,971
pretty well by now, hmm?

937
00:40:43,973 --> 00:40:45,640
How do you think
he's going to respond

938
00:40:45,642 --> 00:40:46,757
when my colleagues
approach him

939
00:40:46,759 --> 00:40:48,392
with a deal
to reduce his sentence

940
00:40:48,394 --> 00:40:50,144
in exchange for the name
of his accomplice?

941
00:40:50,146 --> 00:40:51,729
I'm done with this.
How loyal do you think

942
00:40:51,731 --> 00:40:53,064
your father's
going to be

943
00:40:53,066 --> 00:40:54,899
when you're next
on the chopping block

944
00:40:54,901 --> 00:40:56,634
and he's got freedom
at his fingertips?

945
00:40:56,636 --> 00:40:58,686
Hmm?

946
00:40:58,688 --> 00:41:00,938
Is he going to hesitate
for even a second

947
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,474
before he renounces you?

948
00:41:04,493 --> 00:41:06,494
Will he visit you
in prison?

949
00:41:06,496 --> 00:41:09,146
(door buzzes open)

950
00:41:19,925 --> 00:41:22,009
What are those?

951
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:23,344
Your trophies.

952
00:41:23,346 --> 00:41:26,097
From each of
the crime scenes in 1999.

953
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:27,715
$1,000 shoes.

954
00:41:28,767 --> 00:41:30,635
Your son told us
where you hid them.

955
00:41:30,637 --> 00:41:32,336
Same place you
stashed that pistol.

956
00:41:32,338 --> 00:41:33,721
What are you
talking about?

957
00:41:33,723 --> 00:41:35,106
I don't have a son.

958
00:41:35,108 --> 00:41:37,225
His name is Sean Figueroa,

959
00:41:37,227 --> 00:41:39,277
and he has
a quite compelling story.

960
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:41,445
GREGSON:
Five new murders, Wade.

961
00:41:41,447 --> 00:41:43,147
Sean's going away,

962
00:41:43,149 --> 00:41:45,900
and you're getting five
new conspiracy charges.

963
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,704
No.

964
00:41:49,706 --> 00:41:51,822
You-you framed me.

965
00:41:51,824 --> 00:41:53,791
You bastard, you framed me.
Hey, hey, back up!

966
00:41:53,793 --> 00:41:55,493
I'm only in here because of you!
Hey, Crewes, that's enough.

967
00:41:55,495 --> 00:41:57,123
You framed me, you bastard!
Back in your cell.

968
00:41:57,124 --> 00:41:58,607
You framed me!

969
00:41:59,364 --> 00:42:01,465
Satisfying?

970
00:42:01,467 --> 00:42:03,467
You have no idea.

971
00:42:12,261 --> 00:42:14,962
I'm going to bed.

972
00:42:14,964 --> 00:42:17,348
Good night.

973
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:19,700
She died.

974

We were quite close.

977
00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:35,333
I did not take
her passing well.

00:42:39,004 --> 00:42:40,705
