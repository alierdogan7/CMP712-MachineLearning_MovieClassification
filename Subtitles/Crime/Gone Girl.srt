I'm on
a neighborhood watch list...

1631
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:47,672
because I have to
register as a predator.

1632
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:49,478
I haven't had a date
in almost a decade...

1633
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:51,179

a girl googles me...

01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:55,058

through what happened?

1636
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:58,349
I meet Amy at
this party, you know?

1637
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:00,017
We click. She's perfect.

1638
01:23:00,184 --> 01:23:02,403
She's beautiful,
she's smart,
she's well-read...

1639
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:04,734
she's got an ass
like a 20-year-old stripper.

1640
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:06,570
I think,
"What's the catch?"

1641
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:09,906
A few months, it hits me.
This is not going to be easy.

1642
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:13,493
Girls like a fixer-upper,
but Amy?

1643
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:17,000
She annexed me.
She made me her business.

1644
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:20,834
It was just too much. She
went out and bought me ties.

1645
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,090
And we must have gone
20 rounds over that.

1646
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:25,876
Ties. The whole thing
just became...

1647
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:27,340
So, you broke up with her.

1648
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,717
No, I just backed away.

1649
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,554
Gave her some space.
No big deal, right?

1650
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,263
So I thought.

1651
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:36,599
Then one night, Amy comes
over to my place...

1652
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:39,561
with a bottle of bourbon
and a bootleg of
this band I love.

1653
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:42,602
And within two minutes,
she's got my pants
around my ankles...

1654
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:44,236
and she is
kneeling down, and...

1655
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:46,271
I'm sorry.
I know it's your wife.

1656
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:48,190
You had sex?
Yeah, consensual.

1657
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:50,451
It was rough, but she
was screaming for it.

1658
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:53,245
Next morning, there's
two cops at my door.

1659
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:56,369
Amy has wounds that
are consistent with rape.

1660
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:59,581
Ligature marks on her
wrist, and my semen.

1661
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:03,293
It looks like I've tied Amy
to my bed, and raped her.

1662
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:04,798
Me!

1663
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,584
And then,
guess what they find.

1664
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,798
Headboards of my bed,
one on each side.

1665
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:10,428
The ties you wouldn't wear.

1666
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:11,930
You do know your wife.

1667
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:14,307
Did you ever see her again?
Yeah.

1668
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:15,888

1669
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:17,765
