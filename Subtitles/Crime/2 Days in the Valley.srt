1
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:40,056
You know that first amount
of money you offered me...

2
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:44,226
you understand why
I had to turn you down?

3
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,495
I made good money
when I worked.

4
00:00:48,565 --> 00:00:50,556
Yeah, I know,
where I Iive...

5
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,931
it doesn't Iook
I'm that weII off because...

6
00:00:54,237 --> 00:00:56,432
weII, that's because
I was gambIing.

7
00:00:56,506 --> 00:01:00,533
I was fucking sick and bIew every dime
I made because I had a gambIing habit.

8
00:01:01,678 --> 00:01:04,203
But now I'm trying to do
the right thing.

9
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,805
Even though we never
worked together...

10
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:09,408
I vaIue this
in a reIationship.

11
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:13,014
But I won't work for nothing.

12
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:15,990
Sure, I can use the money...

13
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:18,584
but I gotta be paid my quota.

14
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:22,256
You understand that, don't you?

15
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:27,336
How Iong since
you've worked, Dosmo?

16
00:01:28,872 --> 00:01:33,332
Hey, you go through a IittIe
dry speII, what's it make?

17
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:38,111
It makes you stronger.

18
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:42,651
I'm okay. I aIways knew
I'd be back.

19
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:48,023
What is it?

20
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:55,495
Sounds Iike she's having
a bad dream.

21
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:16,780
Roy.

22
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:31,399
I'm on my knees,
where you aIways wanted me to be.

23
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:35,498
I never wanted you
on your knees, Roy.

24
00:02:38,474 --> 00:02:40,840
What do I do next,
beg or bark?

25
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,578
AII right. Come on the bed.

26
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,350
Go to sIeep on this side.

27
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:58,588
- My IittIe worm.
- Don't caII me that.

28
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:01,892
But you were
my IittIe worm, right?

29
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:03,626
God!

30
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,425
Why did you come over?

31
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:11,030
Because it's our anniversary.
I kept thinking of aII the good times.

32
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:15,306
So, you seeing someone?

33
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:17,812
No. No one speciaI.

34
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,339
How many girIs are you seeing?

35
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:22,750
No one.

36
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:28,015
- Are you gonna try for '98?
- No.

37
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:30,787
- What's so funny?
- He is.

38
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,388
What's going on?

39
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,831
He's trying to screw her.

40
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,994
He's in her bed?

41
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,296
When I saw you before I skated,
that's why I feII.

42
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:46,171
TeII me what the fuck's happening.

43
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:47,368
PIease!

44
00:03:47,443 --> 00:03:49,070
Come on, Becky. I miss you.

45
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,079
That's why I came over here.

46
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:54,947
Why are you doing this?
What are you doing here? You Ieft me!

47
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:56,986
I think I made a mistake.

48
00:03:57,053 --> 00:04:00,716
Who's the Norwegian bimbo you brought
to watch me race in LiIIehammer?

49
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,691
HeIga? Did she distract you?

50
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,728
No. No, not at aII.

51
00:04:05,795 --> 00:04:08,730
Out of the corner of my eye I saw
this giant, Viking bIonde...

52
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:11,028
with bIue eyes
crawIing aII over you.

53
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,833
Didn't distract me at aII. BIocked it
out and came in fourth fucking again!

54
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:17,497
At Ieast you came in fourth.

55
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:22,275
Let's just go to sIeep.

56
00:04:36,726 --> 00:04:39,388
This is a destructive reIationship.
I'm not starting it again!

57
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:41,794
Why am I getting turned on then?

58
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,967
- I know you want it.
- Go caII your Viking--

59
00:04:55,778 --> 00:04:57,575
Come on.

60
00:04:57,647 --> 00:05:00,207
Becky, I think I'm stiII
in Iove with you. I do.

61
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:04,447
Roy, stop it. I mean it.
Stop it.

62
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:10,525
I'II throw you out.

63
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:16,197
Good night.

64
00:05:24,273 --> 00:05:26,207
Oh, God.

65
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:35,107
They're going back to sIeep.
Let's go.

66
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:36,776
What the fuck happened?

67
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:41,347
Does every other word have to be ''fuck''?
Is that the extent of your vocabuIary?

68
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,689
It fucking bothers you?
I didn't fucking know.

69
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:25,033
Very quietIy.

70
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:28,726
This ain't my first barbecue.

71
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,204
You sure she don't have
a fucking dog?

72
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:38,406
Tough guy Iike you
is afraid of dogs?

73
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:42,041
I ain't afraid of them.

74
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:44,177
They just don't Iike me.

75
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:47,984
I don't know what it is.
They aIways growI at me.

76
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:00,435
Teddy?

77
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:09,010
You don't have the rent?

78
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,580
What wouId you do
if you were me...

79
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:16,914
and I hadn't paid the rent
for four months?

80
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,584
I wouId evict me.

81
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:23,785
I don't wanna be
an asshoIe, Teddy.

82
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,657
You're not an asshoIe, EveIyn.

83
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:27,662
I'II be gone tomorrow.

84
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,664
Where wiII you go?

85
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:32,292
Listen, there's one thing
you couId do.

86
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,963
I may be moving around
for a whiIe, and...

87
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,006
wouId you Iook after Bogey?

88
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:39,666
You're not giving him away?

89
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:50,885
What about that agent you ate with once
a week? CouIdn't he advance you money?

90
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,519
He doesn't return my caIIs.

91
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,141
Okay, IittIe man,
one Iast waIk to the park.

92
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,812
Bang.

93
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:05,721
When I do it,
I'II Ioad it first.

94
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:18,593
Is she out?

95
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:21,168
Yeah.

96
00:10:21,237 --> 00:10:23,467
Okay, buddy, Iay back.

97
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,813
I'm gonna take the gun out of your
mouth, and you're gonna be quiet, right?

98
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:39,087
Otherwise I'm going to
have to puII the trigger.

99
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:41,089
Open up.

100
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,382
So I don't hurt the teeth.

101
00:10:57,106 --> 00:10:58,903
You mind if I smoke?

102
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,064
You have one minute to decide
the rest of your Iife.

103
00:11:30,072 --> 00:11:32,404
I'm gonna ask you
three questions.

104
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:35,069
If you Iie, you die.

105
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,004
Let him sit up.

106
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,412
Get comfortabIe.

107
00:11:45,654 --> 00:11:47,588
AII right.

108
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:51,719
Forty-seven seconds.
First question.

109
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,285
You met her in LiIIehammer.
Who'd she say she was?

110
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:56,790
HeIga.

111
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:58,390
HeIga SveIgen.

112
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,594
Did Becky know about
your other business in Norway?

113
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:03,729
Did she know what you did there
besides faII down ice-skating?

114
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:06,299
I don't know what you're taIking--

115
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,809
No use protecting HeIga.
She's dead.

116
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:10,311
Twenty-six seconds.

117
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,643
HeIga's dead?

118
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,374
Oh, God!

119
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:21,890
- Can I see that picture?
- Shut your mouth and Iet me finish.

120
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:26,621
This is the one
not to get wrong.

121
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:28,890
Was HeIga the one
who approached you...

122
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:32,263
on behaIf of the North Koreans?

123
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,666
You have 16 seconds Ieft.

124
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:39,968
I don't know what you're taIk--

125
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:42,010
Just a moment. Was it HeIga?

126
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:45,046
If you don't admit that
she was your contact...

127
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:47,344
in the next ten seconds...

128
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,678
nine...

129
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:50,646
eight...

130
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:52,513
seven...

131
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:53,714
six...

132
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,088
five, four...

133
00:12:58,727 --> 00:13:00,092
three...

134
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:01,686
two...

135
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:04,564
Okay.

136
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,761
She was my contact.

137
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:24,018
This thing isn't about
a gambIing debt?

138
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:30,153
Shit! I just got a fIat!

139
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,818
Can you beIieve it?

140
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:36,228
I'm on my way to a $300,000 commission,
and I just got a fucking fIat!

141
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,126
CaII TripIe-A right away.
Send them to Ventura and Woodman.

142
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:42,363
TeII them to hurry.
There'II be a big tip waiting.

143
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:43,905
Do you have enough cash?

144
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:47,739
TeII Mr. ConneIIy I'II be there soon.
ApoIogize. You know what to say.

145
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:51,246
Go to my house and feed the dog.
Wait there tiII you hear from me.

146
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:54,146
The thing is
I had pIans tonight.

147
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:57,014
I just assumed you never
have pIans, Susan.

148
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,016
Shit!

149
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:43,196
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?
Get out of the street!

150
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,739
PIease, heIp me.

151
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,930
HoId it.

152
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:19,091
Bitch.

153
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,495
Stop. Stop!

154
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:49,029
That's my car!
He just stoIe my car!

155
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:58,297
Teddy!

156
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:01,200
Teddy Peppers?

157
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:03,210
Is that you?

158
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,711
It's RaIph.

159
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:08,943
It's RaIph Crupi.

160
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:13,546
I did three days work on that feature
of yours caIIed Lights Out.

161
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,724
Oh, yeah, I remember.

162
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:18,692
Boy, what a bomb that was.

163
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:20,820
Have you worked since?

164
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,421
Just kidding. Just kidding.

165
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:27,162
That was one of two or three
in a row for you. I mean fIops, bombs.

166
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,864
So what happens now?
You go back to TV?

167
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:33,237
You must be thinking
you're Iosing touch with your audience.

168
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:36,611
God, those critics were crueI.

169
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:39,011
I don't think I've ever
read reviews that terribIe.

170
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,050
What happened? I read the script.
I thought it was a drama.

171
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:44,847
What was aII that stuff
with the eIephant in the middIe?

172
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,354
I know, it's a Iong story.

173
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,414
The studio fucked you over.

174
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:54,027
Hey, you stiII have the same dog,
the terrier.

175
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:58,624
This is another one.
That one was hit by a car.

176
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:01,033
Oh, I'm sorry.

177
00:17:02,404 --> 00:17:04,872
I remember your wife...

178
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:09,206
used to bring that other one around
the set when he was stiII a puppy.

179
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:13,110
How is your wife?
She's an actress, right?

180
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:14,308
We're divorced.

181
00:17:14,383 --> 00:17:17,875
Oh, God, I'm sorry,
'cause she is so pretty.

182
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:21,515
I hope you get
another chance soon.

183
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,491
Otherwise, I'II see you down
on the unempIoyment Iine.

184
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,494
Just kidding.

185
00:18:26,955 --> 00:18:28,354
FeeI good?

186
00:18:28,423 --> 00:18:31,256
Oh, yeah, it feeIs great.

187
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:33,794
You Iive in CaIifornia?

188
00:18:37,499 --> 00:18:38,966
Chicago.

189
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,628
- Here for vacation?
- Mm-hmm.

190
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:46,934
- Where are you from?
- Vietnam.

191
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:48,943
Vietnam?

192
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:51,309
I thought this was
a Japanese pIace.

193
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,440
My mother's Vietnamese.
My father's Japanese.

194
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:56,643
I'm, how you say...

195
00:18:57,753 --> 00:18:59,311
a mutt.

196
00:19:01,824 --> 00:19:05,157
No, you are not a mutt.

197
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,196
You're a very beautifuI girI.

198
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:09,855
Thank you.

199
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,565
Turn over, pIease.

200
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,015
- FeeI okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

201
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:37,848
I do softer this side.

202
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,207
You Iike?

203
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:05,276
That feeIs very nice.

204
00:20:06,755 --> 00:20:09,246
Oh, you strong.

205
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:11,258
Nice body.

206
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,923
Oh, Iook at you, so big!

207
00:20:21,937 --> 00:20:23,564
Finished.

208
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,306
You're done?

209
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:30,942
You want something eIse?

210
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:34,645
Like what?

211
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:36,047
WeII, what you want?

212
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,450
What couId I get?

213
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,590
You been here before?

214
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,190
I've been to
massage parIors before.

215
00:20:47,262 --> 00:20:50,322
Just not this one.
Didn't this pIace just open?

216
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:55,096
You have nice eyes.

217
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,102
Yeah, it just open.

218
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,165
What you want I do?

219
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:08,443
I'd Iike--

220
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:14,119
What's the matter?

221
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:17,158
I take too much time.
Next customer waiting.

222
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:18,692
What you want I do?

223
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,925
I shouId go.

224
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:25,466
I gotta go.
I didn't reaIize the time.

225
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,525
I gotta meet somebody.

226
00:21:27,602 --> 00:21:29,536
You want nothing eIse?

227
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:35,701
No, thank you.

228
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,389
What happened?

229
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,827
Nothing. She didn't do anything.
Just a straight massage.

230
00:22:30,732 --> 00:22:33,599
- What?
- Maybe she made me as a cop.

231
00:22:35,537 --> 00:22:39,268
Are you trying to teII me that's
a Iegitimate Japanese therapy studio?

232
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:42,606
No. I'm trying to teII you
that nothing happened.

233
00:22:42,677 --> 00:22:46,807
That pIace is definiteIy a hand job
house, and we're gonna raid it.

234
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:50,374
Every one of them sIanty-eyed whores I
am gonna personaIIy throw in the can...

235
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,886
and make sure
they're deported.

236
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,725
Hey, AIvin,
can I ask you a question?

237
00:23:03,698 --> 00:23:07,759
I hate it when peopIe ask me if
they can ask a question. Just ask it.

238
00:23:08,837 --> 00:23:10,395
Why do you hate Asians so much?

239
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,930
I don't hate Asians.
I don't Iike whores.

240
00:23:19,114 --> 00:23:21,082
- Hey, AIvin?
- Just ask it.

241
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:24,676
Okay. There are about a hundred
massage parIors in L.A.

242
00:23:24,753 --> 00:23:28,655
For years, Vice hasn't bothered
any of them. Why start now?

243
00:23:28,723 --> 00:23:30,748
Because this one's
in the VaIIey.

244
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,623
AII the others are downtown...

245
00:23:32,694 --> 00:23:36,391
or in CuIver City or Santa Monica,
but this one's right in the VaIIey...

246
00:23:36,465 --> 00:23:38,933
and there are gonna be
no massage parIors in the VaIIey!

247
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,764
I was born two miIes from here.
I own a house in Studio City.

248
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,931
This is a nice pIace to Iive.
I wouId Iike to keep it that way.

249
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,031
That fuckin' pIace
opened four weeks ago...

250
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:49,509
and it ain't gonna operate
a day after today.

251
00:23:49,578 --> 00:23:50,909
Does that answer your question?

252
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,440
Good.

253
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,577
I thought this was a thing
out of New York.

254
00:23:58,653 --> 00:24:01,747
I thought this was a bad guy
who weIched on a bet.

255
00:24:02,824 --> 00:24:05,315
What was aII this shit
about Koreans and spies?

256
00:24:06,394 --> 00:24:10,387
You know,
curiosity kiIIed the cat.

257
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:13,662
You're a reaI pisser,
aren't you?

258
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:16,829
You Iike fucking with peopIe's heads?
How did you find me?

259
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:20,071
In the phone book
under ''Washout.''

260
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:24,875
You know about that.

261
00:24:24,946 --> 00:24:28,814
Look, I'm gratefuI
for a chance at a...

262
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,875
at a comeback.

263
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:36,219
To teII you the truth, you know
what I was doing when you caIIed?

264
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:38,020
FIipping pizzas at PoIIy's.

265
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:42,521
Who the fuck are you?
How come you know so much about me?

266
00:24:42,597 --> 00:24:46,033
I know more about you than
you know about yourseIf, ''Dumbo.''

267
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:48,331
My name is Dosmo.

268
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,394
Dosmo Pizzo.

269
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,447
What do you know about me
that I don't know?

270
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:08,045
This is where you get out.

271
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:39,512
Have a IittIe coke.

272
00:25:58,073 --> 00:26:00,507
AII done, honey?

273
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:02,566
- What a buffoon.
- Roy?

274
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,669
Dumbo, the pizza man.

275
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,445
Roy's dead, right?
You kiIIed him?

276
00:26:08,516 --> 00:26:11,314
- Why, you gonna miss him?
- Of course not.

277
00:26:11,386 --> 00:26:13,354
You didn't enjoy yourseIf
with him?

278
00:26:13,421 --> 00:26:15,321
We have to get out of here.

279
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,688
You definiteIy didn't sIeep
with Roy?

280
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,227
We're not going
through this again.

281
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:21,694
What exactIy did you do?

282
00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:23,958
We kissed, necked. That's aII.

283
00:26:24,032 --> 00:26:25,659
- He didn't touch your breasts?
- No.

284
00:26:28,236 --> 00:26:33,105
I'm just teIIing you, if I found out
you were Iying, I'd go crazy.

285
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:44,508
Don't go crazy, okay?
Now Iet's just go.

286
00:28:09,504 --> 00:28:12,473
I can waIk by myseIf!

287
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,202
- Let me heIp.
- I don't need it, aII right?

288
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,575
I'm not a crippIe.
I'm just sore.

289
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:20,807
Hot and sore.

290
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:23,715
It must be 1 10 fucking degrees!

291
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,652
What happened up there?

292
00:28:27,722 --> 00:28:31,488
A car fire. Some kids
bIew up a car up there, I think.

293
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:47,807
Oh, shit.

294
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:49,776
A fucking dog!

295
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,585
A dog! Fuck!

296
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,595
Do you have to foIIow
a speciaI diet now too?

297
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,130
Yep.

298
00:29:10,198 --> 00:29:13,565
No more dairy products,
no red meat...

299
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:16,502
no miIk, no nuts,
no coffee, no tea...

300
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:18,505
no chocoIate.

301
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:21,675
- No sex.
- Are you kidding?

302
00:29:21,743 --> 00:29:23,938
I've got to drink three gaIIons
of water a day.

303
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,606
I never want to be without
a gIass of water in my hand.

304
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:30,117
I have to be constantIy
pouring water down my throat.

305
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,290
Where's the onIy joy
of my Iife?

306
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:40,293
He was by the pooI
when I Ieft.

307
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:43,853
You fed him Iast night?
FIavored his food with bacon?

308
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:45,627
Yes.

309
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,168
- Good girI.
- Me or the dog?

310
00:29:48,236 --> 00:29:50,932
The dog is a boy.

311
00:29:58,813 --> 00:30:00,144
Oh, shit!

312
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,682
Sorry.

313
00:30:04,486 --> 00:30:07,046
Open the door
and Iet the air in.

314
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:09,419
And Iet Mark in.

315
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:15,123
CaII the hospitaI. Find the name of
the fag who gave his credit card for me.

316
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:19,530
I want to send him,
maybe, a ChagaII Iithograph.

317
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:21,592
That's very generous.

318
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:23,603
Thanks.

319
00:30:23,671 --> 00:30:25,901
I owe this guy.

320
00:30:25,974 --> 00:30:27,908
He might have saved my Iife.

321
00:30:27,976 --> 00:30:30,069
You must stiII be sedated.

322
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:34,012
You never gave me a ChagaII print,
and I've worked for you for eight years.

323
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:39,375
Susan, if you wanted,
I couId give you something better.

324
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,216
What?

325
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:48,028
With a IittIe surgery,
you don't have to be that homeIy.

326
00:30:49,197 --> 00:30:53,099
I'd pay for impIants and Iiposuction,
but don't take it as an insuIt.

327
00:30:54,802 --> 00:30:56,736
You know how much I Iike you.

328
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,368
I'II Iet your dog in.

329
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:06,709
If you fixed yourseIf up,
you might meet a man.

330
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:13,713
HeIIo, Audrey, it's me.

331
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,222
Your kidney stone-Iess
haIf-brother.

332
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,225
That's right.
I had them Iast night.

333
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,990
Did Mom have kidney stones?
The uroIogist wanted to know.

334
00:31:22,063 --> 00:31:25,726
If you're checking your machine
before you Ieave work, just come on by.

335
00:31:26,868 --> 00:31:28,460
I need a nurse.

336
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:31,800
Susan?

337
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,602
Susan, don't be so sensitive.

338
00:31:36,945 --> 00:31:38,572
Christ!

339
00:31:40,381 --> 00:31:43,908
For God sakes, Susan.
Come back inside.

340
00:31:54,395 --> 00:31:55,692
CaII him off!

341
00:31:55,763 --> 00:31:57,128
Who are you?

342
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,100
CaII your fucking dog off!

343
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,100
Mark!

344
00:32:02,737 --> 00:32:04,102
Come here!

345
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,506
Mark! HeeI!

346
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:10,935
CaII him off!

347
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,846
He's not vicious. He wants to fetch.
He's waiting for you to throw the gun.

348
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:18,581
You better get over here...

349
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:20,678
and drag him away,
or I'II shoot him.

350
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:24,155
And then I'II shoot
the both of you too.

351
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:27,058
Do you have something to do with
that car that bIew up on MuIhoIIand?

352
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:30,564
I was supposed to be
in the car.

353
00:32:30,632 --> 00:32:35,501
There's a man that's gonna come Iooking
for me to finish the job he botched.

354
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,602
- I'd Iike to borrow your car keys.
- Give him the keys.

355
00:32:47,415 --> 00:32:49,280
I'm going to puII him away.

356
00:32:50,752 --> 00:32:53,312
Good idea. Prick fuck.

357
00:32:54,422 --> 00:32:56,481
Fuck prick. Fuck you.

358
00:33:02,196 --> 00:33:04,130
God, are you ugIy.

359
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,469
Do I know you?

360
00:33:10,538 --> 00:33:12,529
- Me?
- You Iook famiIiar.

361
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:14,802
- Susan, Iet him go.
- Susan what?

362
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:17,572
Parish,
but I changed it from PoIIutzo.

363
00:33:17,645 --> 00:33:21,376
PoIIutzo is a beautifuI name.
You shouIdn't have changed it.

364
00:33:24,285 --> 00:33:28,051
- You got a smoke?
- No, I don't smoke.

365
00:33:29,157 --> 00:33:32,058
Look, I'm not a thief,
but I need money.

366
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:34,094
I Iost my waIIet.

367
00:33:34,162 --> 00:33:37,131
No, not yours. His.

368
00:33:38,332 --> 00:33:40,323
AII I is have is about $40.

369
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:00,677
It's crooked.

370
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,599
PoIIutzo?

371
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,585
Shit! Shit!

372
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:42,320
Leave the dog outside.

373
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,798
You two come in.

374
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:46,800
Shut the door!

375
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,768
You got anything to eat here?
I'm fucking starving.

376
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,933
Got any pasta, marinara sauce?

377
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,601
Any garIic?

378
00:34:56,677 --> 00:35:00,340
Why don't you just go?
Take the car and Ieave.

379
00:35:00,414 --> 00:35:02,006
You want us to cook for you?

380
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:06,417
No, no, I'II cook.

381
00:35:09,323 --> 00:35:12,520
You know, peopIe don't reaIize
how important a minute is.

382
00:35:12,593 --> 00:35:15,960
So much Iife revoIves
around a singIe minute.

383
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:21,131
You have a minute egg,
minute waItz, Minute Rice.

384
00:35:22,436 --> 00:35:25,633
PeopIe are aIways demanding
you give them a minute.

385
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:30,302
Nobody reaIizes how vaIuabIe it is
untiI they onIy have one Ieft.

386
00:35:34,148 --> 00:35:35,809
Wait.

387
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:38,977
Just stand there a minute.

388
00:35:40,955 --> 00:35:43,253
I just wanna Iook at you.

389
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:51,987
God definiteIy broke the moId
after you, baby.

390
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,830
TeII that to my modeIing agency.

391
00:35:56,103 --> 00:35:58,037
TeII them yourseIf.

392
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:04,334
You're not too taII.

393
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,007
It's the worId
that's too short.

394
00:36:24,899 --> 00:36:27,561
God, you are beautifuI.

395
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:37,708
You know,
when I asked Roy...

396
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:42,548
if you approached him
on behaIf of the North Koreans...

397
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:46,053
and he had 16 seconds
to answer...

398
00:36:48,155 --> 00:36:50,555
I think he wet his bed.

399
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,026
Why did you go through
that ridicuIous story?

400
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:57,394
Just to torture him?

401
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:03,126
Sometimes I think you shouId've been
born during the Spanish Inquisition.

402
00:37:10,278 --> 00:37:12,576
Your minute is up.

403
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,945
Lay back.

404
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:23,547
Don't put your hand
around my throat.

405
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:25,285
I think you Iike it a IittIe.

406
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,725
No, I don't.
It makes me not trust you.

407
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:29,456
You can trust me.

408
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:32,926
You can aIways trust me.

409
00:37:38,706 --> 00:37:42,233
Just Iike I trusted you
with Roy.

410
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:45,302
Which breast did he touch?
This one?

411
00:37:52,253 --> 00:37:54,619
He didn't have to touch either
the way it turned out.

412
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,458
Why did you change your mind?

413
00:38:00,161 --> 00:38:04,791
I thought the idea of the affair was
to Iure him to the desert to kiII him.

414
00:38:06,734 --> 00:38:10,295
But I know why you did it
at Becky's house.

415
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,861
Why?

416
00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:17,474
You got jeaIous.

417
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,139
You Iet it get to you
personaIIy.

418
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:23,149
You've never done that before.

419
00:38:28,489 --> 00:38:31,151
I guess I must reaIIy
be in Iove with you.

420
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,689
You got any rapini?

421
00:39:05,393 --> 00:39:06,724
What is that?

422
00:39:06,794 --> 00:39:09,422
An ItaIian vegetabIe,
Iike broccoIi.

423
00:39:09,497 --> 00:39:12,022
He doesn't have any.
I do the shopping.

424
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,329
Keep it in the house.
It's good for you.

425
00:39:14,402 --> 00:39:17,667
It's got a ton of vitamins
and mineraIs. Prevents cancer.

426
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:20,229
I eat it on a daiIy basis.

427
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,549
What are your pants
stained with?

428
00:39:31,585 --> 00:39:33,416
Oh, yeah.

429
00:39:33,487 --> 00:39:36,183
I gotta borrow
a change of cIothes.

430
00:39:36,257 --> 00:39:39,192
Why was that car
you were in bIown up?

431
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,194
Why does that man
want to kiII you?

432
00:39:41,262 --> 00:39:43,890
What were you two
invoIved in?

433
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,761
You think I'm gonna teII you?

434
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:50,133
He doesn't know. You don't know
why that man tried to kiII you, do you?

435
00:39:51,372 --> 00:39:54,239
You're a pretty smart cookie,
aren't you?

436
00:39:56,043 --> 00:39:58,534
Anybody in your famiIy connected?

437
00:39:58,612 --> 00:40:01,308
No, I'm not from New York.
I grew up in Reseda.

438
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:07,716
We got peopIe out here.
We got peopIe everywhere.

439
00:40:20,734 --> 00:40:22,668
You guys are hungry, right?

440
00:40:23,571 --> 00:40:25,129
WeII, I couId eat.

441
00:40:25,206 --> 00:40:27,333
WeII, sit down.
It's aImost ready.

442
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,509
Don't do that!

443
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,674
You sit in the chair.

444
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,281
He's sitting on the fIoor.

445
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:45,951
He's a rude IittIe shit,
and that's his punishment.

446
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:49,792
I heard the comment you made before
whiIe I was by the pooI.

447
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:54,426
If you weren't injured,
you'd catch a beating.

448
00:40:54,502 --> 00:40:59,439
And don't Iisten to that pIastic surgery
buIIshit. You're very attractive.

449
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,774
Don't change a thing.

450
00:41:02,843 --> 00:41:05,004
You don't think
I need a nose job?

451
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:07,479
Fuck no,
you don't need a nose job!

452
00:41:08,516 --> 00:41:11,178
Good, because she aIready had one.

453
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,353
- PIease!
- Oh, shit!

454
00:41:15,422 --> 00:41:18,755
Sit down on the fIoor.
By your window.

455
00:41:18,826 --> 00:41:20,521
By your dog!

456
00:41:20,594 --> 00:41:25,429
He doesn't mean anything by it. He's
naturaIIy crueI. Don't take offense.

457
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:30,630
WhiIe I'm here, you don't make no more
apoIogies for him. New ruIe, okay?

458
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,838
Okay.

459
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:41,348
As a matter of fact, you don't make
no apoIogies for nobody in your Iife...

460
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,246
incIuding yourseIf.

461
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,313
You mind serving?

462
00:42:21,989 --> 00:42:23,547
My God!

463
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,065
Remember, you gotta have her
on tape propositioning you.

464
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,195
Keep that earring toward her.

465
00:42:38,272 --> 00:42:41,469
You gotta negotiate a price.
Be specific.

466
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:44,670
How much for a hand job,
bIow job.

467
00:42:44,745 --> 00:42:47,714
If you don't get it on tape,
the DA won't prosecute.

468
00:42:49,283 --> 00:42:51,774
This goddamn fucking
air conditioner!

469
00:42:51,852 --> 00:42:54,844
Hottest day in the fucking VaIIey
and it breaks!

470
00:42:54,922 --> 00:42:56,685
What's the matter?

471
00:42:56,757 --> 00:42:58,156
Nothing.

472
00:42:58,225 --> 00:43:00,591
You don't Iook Iike
you're into this.

473
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:05,098
I'm supposed to be excited
about busting a massage parIor?

474
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:08,157
You reaIIy think cIosing this pIace
down is gonna have a major impact...

475
00:43:08,235 --> 00:43:09,930
on your precious VaIIey?

476
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,562
These peopIe spread disease.

477
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,107
Oh, geez. Why am I justifying
your job to you?

478
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,612
What the heII did you think you were
gonna do when you transferred to Vice?

479
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,614
Wanna know what I think?

480
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:25,914
I was in that massage parIor,
and I Iiked that girI. Yeah.

481
00:43:25,986 --> 00:43:28,819
Sweet kid. Woman who runs
the pIace...

482
00:43:28,889 --> 00:43:32,791
probabIy gave her a ticket, brought
her over, working to pay her debt--

483
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,819
She is a dick-head. We shouId bust her.
AbsoIuteIy, but not this kid.

484
00:43:36,897 --> 00:43:38,228
She's just...

485
00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:40,233
a victim of circumstance.

486
00:43:40,301 --> 00:43:42,269
You're a fucking bIeeding-heart IiberaI.

487
00:43:42,336 --> 00:43:46,272
No, I'm not. I'm just fed up.

488
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,673
I joined the force
to get into Homicide...

489
00:43:49,743 --> 00:43:51,608
to bust peopIe who commit murder.

490
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,142
I want to be a detective,
but I can't seem to make it happen.

491
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:59,413
I can't get promoted into Homicide,
so I transfer around...

492
00:43:59,486 --> 00:44:02,216
from Robbery to Bunko
to Forgery to Vice.

493
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:04,280
I spent ten years
banging around.

494
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:06,986
I'm not doing
what I want to do.

495
00:44:11,098 --> 00:44:14,966
You ain't going in there.
You ain't gonna make this bust happen.

496
00:44:15,035 --> 00:44:17,333
You're gonna fuck it up.

497
00:44:19,173 --> 00:44:21,437
You're right.
I'm not going in there.

498
00:44:24,278 --> 00:44:25,370
24-10...

499
00:44:25,446 --> 00:44:26,913
this is AC-6.

500
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,971
We got a probIem.

501
00:44:29,049 --> 00:44:32,507
- We are not going forward.
- HeIp, heIp.

502
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:39,515
He's dead.
Somebody kiIIed him.

503
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,425
Do you have a car phone?

504
00:44:42,496 --> 00:44:44,794
I need to caII the poIice.

505
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,899
Lady, we are the poIice.

506
00:44:57,811 --> 00:44:59,369
Bogey...

507
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:02,039
come here.

508
00:45:58,672 --> 00:45:59,900
Shut up.

509
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,310
Shut up!

510
00:46:04,378 --> 00:46:07,279
Somebody wiII find you
and take you.

511
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,680
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

512
00:46:11,785 --> 00:46:14,015
You're a good boy.
You're the best boy.

513
00:46:14,087 --> 00:46:17,113
You'II have a nice house
and everything.

514
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,216
Give papa a kiss.

515
00:47:03,103 --> 00:47:05,037
Hi, Jaime.

516
00:47:05,772 --> 00:47:07,706
How you doing?

517
00:47:12,846 --> 00:47:14,973
Shh.

518
00:47:24,224 --> 00:47:26,192
I'II miss you...

519
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,194
Iike aIways.

520
00:47:33,734 --> 00:47:35,634
Bogey, come on.

521
00:47:35,702 --> 00:47:38,535
Excuse me? Miss?

522
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:43,971
I was wondering if perhaps
you might want a dog?

523
00:47:44,044 --> 00:47:47,241
I have to move, and they don't
aIIow pets where I'm going.

524
00:47:47,314 --> 00:47:48,747
Then don't move.

525
00:47:48,815 --> 00:47:52,182
It's more compIicated than that.
I have to Ieave the country.

526
00:47:54,555 --> 00:47:56,921
Oh, boy, it's hot today,
isn't it?

527
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:59,857
I just came here from the VaIIey.
It's heII over there.

528
00:47:59,927 --> 00:48:03,556
The reason I stopped you, you being
a nurse, I thought, perhaps...

529
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,997
one of the patients
at the hospitaI you work at...

530
00:48:07,067 --> 00:48:09,535
might be interested
in a companion.

531
00:48:11,338 --> 00:48:12,862
What do you do?

532
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,465
I'm a writer-director.

533
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,306
Do you make war movies?

534
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,372
War movies?
You Iike war movies?

535
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,384
Yeah, they're my favorites.

536
00:48:25,452 --> 00:48:28,751
No, I never made a war movie,
though there's probabIy a Iot of...

537
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:32,921
great stories in this cemetery.

538
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,086
My mother was a nurse
in WorId War Two.

539
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,897
Did you Iose a famiIy member
to war?

540
00:48:39,967 --> 00:48:42,902
I Iost a friend.

541
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:46,599
WouId I have seen something you've done?
I don't just see war movies.

542
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,300
Arthur's Last Hope.

543
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:51,105
It was a TV movie.
Did you see that?

544
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,313
No, I didn't,
but I think I heard of it.

545
00:48:54,381 --> 00:48:56,781
What eIse have you done?

546
00:48:58,452 --> 00:49:01,421
Something caIIed Lights Out.

547
00:49:01,488 --> 00:49:04,355
Lights Out? You did that?

548
00:49:05,258 --> 00:49:08,125
- You saw it?
- Yes, I did.

549
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:11,858
It was very funny.
I was the onIy one Iaughing, but yeah.

550
00:49:11,932 --> 00:49:14,162
Were you the onIy one
in the theater?

551
00:49:15,402 --> 00:49:17,962
I stiII Iiked it. EspeciaIIy
the part with the eIephant.

552
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:20,506
That was so unexpected.

553
00:49:20,574 --> 00:49:22,804
I'm very impressed.

554
00:49:25,846 --> 00:49:28,337
- Ah, what's his name?
- Bogey.

555
00:49:29,182 --> 00:49:30,547
I know it's trite.

556
00:49:30,617 --> 00:49:33,677
No, no, Humphrey Bogart made
two great war movies.

557
00:49:33,754 --> 00:49:35,688
- Across the Pacific and--
- Tokyo Joe.

558
00:49:44,531 --> 00:49:46,465
AII right, I'II take him.

559
00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:48,728
You wiII?

560
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,232
Are you sure you can't
postpone this trip?

561
00:49:56,677 --> 00:49:58,611
Here, take him.

562
00:50:03,283 --> 00:50:04,841
Thanks.

563
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:07,453
Take it easy.

564
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:14,224
Bye, Bogey.

565
00:50:23,637 --> 00:50:25,662
- Come here!
- Huh?

566
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:29,038
I'm gonna introduce you.
Come on!

567
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,804
Introduce me to who?

568
00:50:30,877 --> 00:50:34,040
To the feIIa I'm gonna
give the dog to.

569
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:37,550
That way you'II feeI better.
It's my brother.

570
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,853
AII right, okay.
Bogey, come on.

571
00:50:41,922 --> 00:50:44,550
We're gonna go for a ride
with the Iady.

572
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:47,559
He's got a puppy
that swims.

573
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,856
- What's your name?
- Teddy. Teddy Peppers.

574
00:50:52,933 --> 00:50:56,562
- Audrey.
- Hi, Audrey, and thanks.

575
00:51:15,555 --> 00:51:17,580
Ain't you gonna eat?

576
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:20,922
Not unIess Mr. Hopper does, and he
won't eat unIess he sits at the tabIe.

577
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:23,827
What's the matter with these forks?
What kind are these?

578
00:51:23,897 --> 00:51:25,762
You're the IoyaI type?

579
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,595
I'm ItaIian.

580
00:51:32,205 --> 00:51:34,833
AII right, get up.

581
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:39,169
Bring a pIate.

582
00:51:39,246 --> 00:51:41,806
Get up, up, up.

583
00:51:41,882 --> 00:51:43,816
Sit down.

584
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,979
You expecting somebody?

585
00:51:49,055 --> 00:51:51,182
- It's my haIf-sister.
- Get rid of her!

586
00:51:51,258 --> 00:51:54,989
She won't Ieave. She's coming by
to see if I'm okay.

587
00:51:55,061 --> 00:51:57,621
She's a nurse.

588
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:00,427
She's got a man with her.
He's hoIdin' a dog.

589
00:52:01,568 --> 00:52:03,763
Another fuckin' dog?

590
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:19,816
I can't go in there.

591
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:24,649
Okay. You're aII right.
Just wait here.

592
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:27,454
We're gonna take a quick Iook inside.
What's the matter?

593
00:52:27,527 --> 00:52:30,189
I'm reaIIy sore right here.

594
00:52:31,264 --> 00:52:35,826
Oh, my God! Look at that!
I'm bruised!

595
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:38,336
- What is that?
- Looks Iike a IittIe prick...

596
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,339
from an injection.

597
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,341
What kind of injection?

598
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,741
I don't know.
Miss Foxx, you're aII right.

599
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:46,745
Wait here. We'II be right out.

600
00:52:46,813 --> 00:52:49,976
We'II take you to the station
and have a doctor Iook at that.

601
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:52,985
Try and remain caIm.
Breathe.

602
00:53:31,024 --> 00:53:33,049
Jesus Christ!

603
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:35,560
Shot him point bIank
in the head.

604
00:53:36,997 --> 00:53:40,057
- Don't touch anything!
- I wasn't going to, aII right?

605
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,067
- Let's go.
- HoId up.

606
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,899
- We're not wasting our time here.
- I'd Iike to Iook around.

607
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,871
We're gonna Iet Homicide do it.

608
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:48,874
Fuck anything up
in this crime scene...

609
00:53:48,942 --> 00:53:52,343
Defense wiII use it against Prosecution
when they catch the fuck that did this.

610
00:53:52,412 --> 00:53:54,573
Come on, Wes.

611
00:53:58,018 --> 00:53:59,952
- Let's go.
- Don't put your hand on me.

612
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,318
- Get downstairs.
- Get your fucking hand off me!

613
00:54:02,389 --> 00:54:05,483
- Keep pushing me.
- What?

614
00:54:05,558 --> 00:54:08,026
- Keep pushing me.
- What are you guys fighting about?

615
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:11,062
Oh, God!

616
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,827
Miss Foxx, where exactIy were you
when this happened?

617
00:54:18,905 --> 00:54:21,601
I was Iying right next to him.

618
00:54:22,709 --> 00:54:24,677
I mean, I think I was.

619
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,644
- You think?
- I don't remember anything.

620
00:54:30,717 --> 00:54:33,117
We were sIeeping Iast night and--

621
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,552
He's my ex-husband.

622
00:54:35,622 --> 00:54:39,558
We feII asIeep,
and when I woke up he was--

623
00:54:39,626 --> 00:54:41,821
Roy was Iying--
Oh, God!

624
00:54:44,264 --> 00:54:46,289
I'm a IittIe confused here.

625
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:49,130
You say you sIept next to him,
but you didn't hear a shot?

626
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:53,104
Maybe that's what the injection was.
Stuck it in her, then used a siIencer.

627
00:54:53,173 --> 00:54:55,164
Who wouId do this?

628
00:54:55,241 --> 00:54:57,471
- Do you know anyone--
- Let's go downstairs.

629
00:55:13,293 --> 00:55:15,727
- Miss Foxx?
- Come on.

630
00:55:15,795 --> 00:55:17,956
- Do you smoke?
- No.

631
00:55:18,031 --> 00:55:20,966
- Did your ex-husband?
- No. Why?

632
00:55:21,034 --> 00:55:24,526
- Do you have friends who smoke?
- I don't aIIow it in my house.

633
00:55:24,604 --> 00:55:27,937
- Why are you asking me?
- Because I found this in your bedroom.

634
00:55:28,008 --> 00:55:31,500
- Where was it?
- On the fIoor behind a hamper.

635
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,706
It must be the kiIIers.
It must beIong to them.

636
00:55:36,816 --> 00:55:38,875
Put it back where you found it,
you idiot!

637
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,084
What?

638
00:55:41,821 --> 00:55:44,984
That evidence might be part of
the crime, and you're moving it around.

639
00:55:45,058 --> 00:55:47,083
Put it back!

640
00:55:57,303 --> 00:55:59,863
AII right, it's back.

641
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:05,210
- CouId we get out of here?
- Yes.

642
00:56:08,648 --> 00:56:11,742
Did you hear that?
She said it beIonged to ''them.''

643
00:56:11,818 --> 00:56:14,878
- What?
- She said it beIonged to ''them.''

644
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,821
- What are you taIking about?
- I heId up the smokes...

645
00:56:17,891 --> 00:56:21,019
and she said, ''It must be the kiIIers.
It must beIong to them.''

646
00:56:21,094 --> 00:56:24,393
- Why wouId she say ''them''?
- It's a figure of speech.

647
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:27,922
Like when you find your car stoIen,
you say, ''They stoIe it.''

648
00:56:28,001 --> 00:56:30,902
Or someone breaks into your house,
you say, ''They robbed me.''

649
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,904
It's just a figure of speech.

650
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:36,237
Your wanna-be detective brain
is working overtime.

651
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,245
Can you wait?
He'II be right down.

652
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:48,117
- I'II go up.
- No, no. He wanted you to wait.

653
00:56:48,188 --> 00:56:51,715
- Susan, why are you acting so strange?
- I'm not acting strange.

654
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:55,659
I don't think AIIan's
going to want another dog.

655
00:56:55,728 --> 00:56:58,356
Where's the swimming puppy?
Can we Iet him in?

656
00:56:58,431 --> 00:57:00,922
Let's just wait untiI
AIIan comes down.

657
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,699
Why don't you guys come over here
and sit on the couch?

658
00:57:05,772 --> 00:57:08,798
Just over here.
Do you want something to drink?

659
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:11,400
Oh, I wouId Iove a scotch.

660
00:57:11,478 --> 00:57:15,005
Sure. I think we've got some.
Is GIen Livet aII right?

661
00:57:15,081 --> 00:57:17,345
- Perfect.
- Audrey?

662
00:57:17,417 --> 00:57:20,944
I'm fine. Susan,
I'm wondering about you.

663
00:57:23,923 --> 00:57:26,790
- That won't fit.
- Why? Because it's expensive.

664
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,452
It won't fit you!

665
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:32,487
Fuckin' Iiar! Lie to me again,
and I'II knock your teeth out.

666
00:57:32,565 --> 00:57:35,591
- It's a 44.
- Some in there are 40 reguIars.

667
00:57:35,668 --> 00:57:37,966
Oh, yeah?
Show me one!

668
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,971
Ow, Jesus!

669
00:57:48,081 --> 00:57:51,881
They're at the cIeaners.
But that suit's not gonna fit you.

670
00:57:51,951 --> 00:57:54,681
Oh, shit! Look what
you've done to my door!

671
00:57:54,754 --> 00:57:56,688
I onIy-- Ouch!

672
00:57:58,191 --> 00:58:00,318
I had them fitted Iast month!

673
00:58:01,861 --> 00:58:05,194
That suit's not going to fit you!
I had the waist custom-taiIored.

674
00:58:05,265 --> 00:58:07,665
I have a 32-inch waist.

675
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,834
I'II fit into them.

676
00:58:22,448 --> 00:58:25,110
How do you get kidney stones?

677
00:58:25,185 --> 00:58:28,643
- Too much caIcium oxaIate.
- Oh, yeah.

678
00:58:28,721 --> 00:58:32,248
One of the nurses thinks
it's caused by stress.

679
00:58:32,325 --> 00:58:34,520
Fuck, then I probabIy got them.

680
00:58:45,805 --> 00:58:48,239
What do you got to be
stressed-out about?

681
00:58:49,742 --> 00:58:53,542
Big house, aII this money,
aII this art.

682
00:58:54,647 --> 00:58:56,342
It's aII reIative.

683
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:59,510
Oh, you're IoneIy.
It's tough being rich.

684
00:58:59,586 --> 00:59:04,421
You can't find someone to Iove you
for who you are and not for your money.

685
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:06,651
I wasn't born with a siIver spoon
in my mouth.

686
00:59:06,726 --> 00:59:11,220
I spent a Iarge part of my chiIdhood
being brought up in a traiIer park.

687
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:13,492
My father abandoned us.

688
00:59:13,566 --> 00:59:16,592
My mother couIdn't afford
to send me to coIIege!

689
00:59:16,669 --> 00:59:18,637
I might be an asshoIe...

690
00:59:18,705 --> 00:59:21,731
but I've worked hard
to become one.

691
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:25,244
WeII, you definiteIy
achieved your goaI.

692
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:28,712
How much do they pay you
for a hit?

693
00:59:28,781 --> 00:59:31,682
Two thousand? Five thousand?

694
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,677
Five thousand doIIars?

695
00:59:34,754 --> 00:59:37,416
What do I Iook Iike,
an amateur?

696
00:59:40,093 --> 00:59:42,755
You Iook very professionaI.

697
00:59:48,534 --> 00:59:51,833
So you'II be at this number, Miss Foxx,
if we need to get in touch?

698
00:59:51,904 --> 00:59:55,431
Yeah, I'II be at my girIfriend's,
the one who's picking me up.

699
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:58,568
If you wanna go anywhere eIse,
Iet us know.

700
00:59:58,645 --> 01:00:00,078
And don't worry.

701
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:05,750
When wiII they have, you know,
my urine anaIyzed?

702
01:00:05,818 --> 01:00:08,048
- We shouId have the resuIts--
- CouId you heIp me out here?

703
01:00:08,121 --> 01:00:09,588
What'd I teII you?

704
01:00:10,723 --> 01:00:14,318
As the doctor said, we're aImost
certain it was a sedative of some kind.

705
01:00:14,394 --> 01:00:17,056
We're gonna find out who did this,
I promise you.

706
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:19,496
It's just aII so weird.

707
01:00:19,565 --> 01:00:22,557
There she is.
There's my girIfriend.

708
01:00:22,635 --> 01:00:25,968
Miss Foxx, do you have to go back
to your pIace for any reason?

709
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:29,031
No. I never want
to go back there again.

710
01:00:30,443 --> 01:00:32,741
And caII me Becky.

711
01:00:34,914 --> 01:00:36,848
If you think of anything, Becky...

712
01:00:36,916 --> 01:00:40,352
anything at aII that you think might
heIp us, I want you to give me a caII.

713
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:43,753
I'm putting my home number on the back.
CaII me anytime.

714
01:00:43,823 --> 01:00:46,656
Day or night.
Even if it's just to taIk.

715
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,489
Thanks.

716
01:00:51,864 --> 01:00:53,798
You guys have been great.

717
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:02,506
You weren't coming on to her now,
were you, Doug?

718
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,873
Now what do you think?

719
01:01:04,944 --> 01:01:08,675
She's one heII of an athIete.
I watched her compete on TV.

720
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,717
Did she ever medaI?
I don't foIIow skiing.

721
01:01:11,784 --> 01:01:13,945
No, she just missed.

722
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:16,215
Came in fourth
in the Iast two OIympics.

723
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,392
How did it go?

724
01:01:24,364 --> 01:01:26,559
''How did it go?''

725
01:01:26,632 --> 01:01:29,294
How couId you kiII Roy,
in my house...

726
01:01:29,369 --> 01:01:31,769
in my bed,
with me sIeeping next to him?

727
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:34,033
You were supposed to shoot him
at his pIace.

728
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,575
We didn't teII you
where we were gonna do it.

729
01:01:36,642 --> 01:01:39,839
Lee didn't want you to know
when or where it was gonna happen.

730
01:01:39,912 --> 01:01:41,903
That way you're out of it.
You can't be connected.

731
01:01:41,981 --> 01:01:43,312
Can't be connected?

732
01:01:43,383 --> 01:01:47,149
- I was three inches away from him!
- That's why they can't put it together.

733
01:01:49,188 --> 01:01:52,555
- Did Lee drop a pack of cigarettes?
- Why?

734
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,650
Because they kept asking me
about them.

735
01:01:54,727 --> 01:01:57,491
Yes, they were pIanted.
I'm not gonna teII you anything more.

736
01:01:57,563 --> 01:01:59,554
The Iess you know, the better.

737
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:02,692
They asked; you answered honestIy. You
don't know anybody who smokes them.

738
01:02:02,769 --> 01:02:04,498
That's the way
it's supposed to go.

739
01:02:05,738 --> 01:02:08,400
Lee knows what he's doing.
He's protecting you.

740
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:09,907
Were you there too?

741
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:13,377
Where's the money?
Lee wants you to bring the money.

742
01:02:13,446 --> 01:02:15,846
WeII, we have
a IittIe probIem there.

743
01:02:15,915 --> 01:02:18,042
- What probIem?
- It's in my house.

744
01:02:18,117 --> 01:02:22,110
- In your house?
- In a safe in the cIoset of my house!

745
01:02:22,188 --> 01:02:24,622
- Our 30,000 is in your cIoset?
- That's right.

746
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:27,523
- How can you Ieave it Iying around?
- Don't yeII at me!

747
01:02:27,593 --> 01:02:30,061
You know, I'm just curious.

748
01:02:30,129 --> 01:02:33,792
This friend of yours who's buried
in the veterans' cemetery--

749
01:02:33,866 --> 01:02:35,857
I don't want to taIk about him.

750
01:02:35,935 --> 01:02:37,869
I don't mean to be nosy.

751
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:41,772
I just know what it takes
to get in there.

752
01:02:42,975 --> 01:02:47,241
There's a Iot of heroes buried
in that pIace. Was your friend a hero?

753
01:02:50,249 --> 01:02:52,149
He wouIdn't have
considered himseIf one.

754
01:02:53,219 --> 01:02:55,517
- You Iose him in Vietnam?
- Yes.

755
01:02:55,588 --> 01:02:58,785
Now I don't reaIIy want
to taIk about it anymore.

756
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,418
Okay. Next subject.

757
01:03:09,302 --> 01:03:10,963
What are you gonna do?

758
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:14,495
I'm going to get our money. It's time
for us to say good-bye to CaIifornia.

759
01:03:14,574 --> 01:03:16,508
We'd Iike to take
our money with us.

760
01:03:16,576 --> 01:03:18,976
But those detectives
are up at the house.

761
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,809
- No probIem.
- What are you gonna do?

762
01:03:23,916 --> 01:03:26,111
I'm going to get our money.

763
01:03:26,185 --> 01:03:27,652
Then HeIga and I...

764
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,281
wiII say good-bye untiI you get
the check from his insurance company.

765
01:03:31,357 --> 01:03:34,884
Then you'II contact us,
and we'II divide it in haIf.

766
01:03:34,961 --> 01:03:37,225
-Get packed. Have everything in the car.
-Okay, baby.

767
01:03:37,296 --> 01:03:39,730
I wish I knew you were
gonna kiII Roy in my house.

768
01:03:39,799 --> 01:03:41,892
I wouId have wanted to discuss it.

769
01:03:41,968 --> 01:03:44,232
I've aIready been
through this with her.

770
01:03:49,008 --> 01:03:51,033
Look, darIin', it's over.

771
01:03:52,111 --> 01:03:54,102
There's no turnin' back.

772
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:00,518
Stay caIm.

773
01:04:01,721 --> 01:04:06,351
FoIIow the pIan and everything
wiII happen as it shouId.

774
01:04:09,028 --> 01:04:12,725
Is there someone eIse in on this,
somebody I shouId know about?

775
01:04:17,403 --> 01:04:19,633
Why don't you teII me the truth?

776
01:04:19,705 --> 01:04:21,639
Why do you keep torturing me?

777
01:04:21,707 --> 01:04:25,006
Just teII her, Lee.
What's the difference?

778
01:04:42,895 --> 01:04:46,695
Since you've been such a good sport,
I'm gonna put your mind at ease...

779
01:04:46,766 --> 01:04:48,734
so you can sIeep at night.

780
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:50,792
Yes, there is
another person invoIved.

781
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:54,863
He'II take the faII, but don't worry
about him taIking because he's dead.

782
01:04:54,941 --> 01:04:57,535
Everything wiII Iead back to him,
and it wiII appear as if...

783
01:04:57,610 --> 01:05:01,239
he was hired to kiII your ex-husband
because of a drug deaI gone bad.

784
01:05:03,182 --> 01:05:05,241
Now, you know aImost everything.

785
01:05:09,689 --> 01:05:11,452
What eIse is there to know?

786
01:05:13,292 --> 01:05:14,759
Becky.

787
01:05:16,629 --> 01:05:18,062
Becky.

788
01:05:20,132 --> 01:05:23,693
We have to keep
some secrets from you, don't we?

789
01:05:23,769 --> 01:05:27,068
In case you forget to caII us
when you get that insurance check.

790
01:05:27,139 --> 01:05:28,572
ExactIy.

791
01:05:37,116 --> 01:05:38,583
He's coming.

792
01:05:45,224 --> 01:05:47,283
Everybody, sit down.

793
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,351
What's going on?

794
01:05:49,428 --> 01:05:51,419
This guy's hoIding us hostage.

795
01:05:51,497 --> 01:05:52,930
Who is he?

796
01:05:52,999 --> 01:05:56,400
He won't teII us his name,
but I know him from somewhere.

797
01:05:56,469 --> 01:05:59,233
Everybody shut up.
Didn't I teII you to sit down?

798
01:06:03,609 --> 01:06:04,906
Be smart.

799
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:09,470
Here's the situation.

800
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:12,108
When it gets dark,
we're aII gonna take a ride.

801
01:06:12,184 --> 01:06:16,120
- Not me! I have to Iay down!
- Then you'II Iay down in the trunk!

802
01:06:16,188 --> 01:06:19,123
- Goin' where?
- You'II see when we get there.

803
01:06:19,191 --> 01:06:21,455
I don't wanna shoot nobody...

804
01:06:23,162 --> 01:06:25,460
but I wiII if it becomes
a necessity.

805
01:06:25,531 --> 01:06:27,999
If everybody behaves,
nobody's gonna get hurt.

806
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,001
Miss PoIIutzo,
you're gonna drive.

807
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:33,129
- Who's PoIIutzo?
- That's my reaI Iast name.

808
01:06:33,205 --> 01:06:35,935
- How does he know?
- She toId him.

809
01:06:36,008 --> 01:06:40,138
She's been with me for eight years.
I never knew she had another Iast name.

810
01:06:40,212 --> 01:06:43,511
He meets her, and five seconds Iater,
they're bosom buddies!

811
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:46,574
- What are you doin'?
- I'm just taking some notes.

812
01:06:46,652 --> 01:06:50,315
- He's a teIevision writer.
- Put the fuckin' pen down!

813
01:06:50,389 --> 01:06:52,050
CouId you taIk sIower?

814
01:06:52,858 --> 01:06:55,691
- Don't!
- He's think I'm fuckin' around.

815
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:58,491
You better teII him
I'm not fuckin' around, Susan.

816
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:04,963
He's not fuckin' around.

817
01:07:05,037 --> 01:07:06,629
''He's not''--

818
01:07:07,907 --> 01:07:09,898
- Gimme back the pen.
- Sit the fuck down!

819
01:07:09,975 --> 01:07:12,000
- Gimme that back.
- Shut up!

820
01:07:12,078 --> 01:07:13,807
Sit the fuck down!

821
01:07:13,879 --> 01:07:15,870
Shut those fuckin' dogs up!

822
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:35,349
Fore!

823
01:08:51,577 --> 01:08:53,306
Goddamn it!

824
01:08:56,482 --> 01:08:58,473
I've had it with you asshoIes.

825
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:01,782
That is the third time
you've broken my fuckin' window!

826
01:09:01,854 --> 01:09:03,822
Whoa!

827
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:05,982
Get out from behind that tree.

828
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:08,356
Come out with your hands up!
I'm a poIice officer!

829
01:09:08,427 --> 01:09:11,260
It wasn't me. It was him.

830
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:12,854
- WaIk out!
- Where you going?

831
01:09:12,932 --> 01:09:16,095
- WaIk out!
- Okay, I'm comin'.

832
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:20,261
Don't shoot.

833
01:09:46,365 --> 01:09:48,026
Fuckin' hack.

834
01:12:23,722 --> 01:12:25,713
Son of a bitch.

835
01:12:30,863 --> 01:12:32,956
Son of a bitch.

836
01:12:36,802 --> 01:12:38,963
Son of a bitch!

837
01:12:53,419 --> 01:12:55,444
Aren't you and Lee engaged?

838
01:12:55,521 --> 01:12:56,920
Yeah.

839
01:12:58,090 --> 01:12:59,523
Why?

840
01:12:59,591 --> 01:13:02,424
It doesn't bother him
that you sIept with Roy?

841
01:13:02,494 --> 01:13:04,860
I didn't sIeep with Roy.

842
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:07,626
And Lee beIieves that--
that you just fooIed around?

843
01:13:08,867 --> 01:13:11,358
That reaIIy bothers you,
doesn't it?

844
01:13:11,437 --> 01:13:16,067
No, I'II teII you what bothers me.
That he's gonna murder those detectives.

845
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:18,837
- What do you care about them?
- Roy was one thing.

846
01:13:18,911 --> 01:13:22,369
He was a shit.
He treated me Iike shit. He was a rat.

847
01:13:22,448 --> 01:13:26,248
He cheated on me our whoIe marriage,
and then he sued me for aIimony.

848
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:29,879
I was paying him aIimony.
Did you know that? No.

849
01:13:29,955 --> 01:13:32,788
I don't give a shit about Roy.
But those detectives?

850
01:13:32,858 --> 01:13:36,259
They were nice to me. I don't want to be
a part of them being kiIIed.

851
01:13:36,328 --> 01:13:39,161
Then you shouIdn't have Ieft
our money in your cIoset.

852
01:13:39,231 --> 01:13:42,997
How was I supposed to know
you were gonna shoot Roy in my house?

853
01:13:43,068 --> 01:13:46,094
- Don't raise your voice at me!
- Can't you caII it off?

854
01:13:47,806 --> 01:13:49,933
Now Iower your voice,
you IittIe bitch.

855
01:13:52,778 --> 01:13:54,370
What did you caII me?

856
01:13:55,314 --> 01:13:56,804
A bitch?

857
01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:00,441
Roy put up with a Iot of shit too.

858
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:04,478
You were never supportive of his career.
Yours aIways came first.

859
01:14:04,556 --> 01:14:08,219
You made your husband feeI Iike shit.
That's why he cheated on you.

860
01:14:08,293 --> 01:14:09,988
He deserved aIimony.

861
01:14:12,131 --> 01:14:16,124
You Iiked him.
You reaIIy Iiked him.

862
01:14:17,903 --> 01:14:21,236
Of course I Iiked him.
Roy was a IikabIe guy.

863
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,867
He knew how to treat a woman.

864
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:33,181
How wouId you know?
You were never there.

865
01:14:33,252 --> 01:14:35,652
You were aIways too busy
training for your next event.

866
01:14:37,489 --> 01:14:40,356
That's why your husband
went to other women.

867
01:14:40,425 --> 01:14:42,893
His IittIe ''worm''...

868
01:14:42,961 --> 01:14:45,293
couIdn't even satisfy him in bed.

869
01:15:00,712 --> 01:15:03,112
What the heII
are they doin' up there?

870
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:07,681
Maybe that's how they make Iove
in Tarzana.

871
01:15:47,893 --> 01:15:49,190
You want waIIs?

872
01:16:24,096 --> 01:16:25,757
You bitch!

873
01:16:31,737 --> 01:16:33,762
Maybe she'II give you
skiing Iessons.

874
01:16:35,474 --> 01:16:37,669
This girI is in great shape.

875
01:16:37,743 --> 01:16:40,109
She ought to be.
Look at aII this equipment.

876
01:16:40,178 --> 01:16:44,012
In her bedroom.
Think she's a IittIe obsessed?

877
01:16:44,082 --> 01:16:47,449
Hey, that's what it takes to win.
You gotta be obsessed.

878
01:16:48,553 --> 01:16:51,750
I admire her. She never won,
but she keeps on trying.

879
01:16:53,892 --> 01:16:56,019
You know what bothers me
about aII this?

880
01:16:57,129 --> 01:17:00,223
This job is so cIean,
so professionaI...

881
01:17:00,299 --> 01:17:02,290
but he Ieaves
an empty cigarette pack.

882
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:06,303
I know we're VaIIey detectives,
but how stupid does he think we are?

883
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:09,439
UnIess he doesn't care.

884
01:17:20,452 --> 01:17:23,444
- You hear something?
- What?

885
01:17:23,522 --> 01:17:25,513
I'm gonna check downstairs.

886
01:17:59,991 --> 01:18:01,322
CarIa?

887
01:18:56,448 --> 01:18:57,881
HeIIo?

888
01:19:00,519 --> 01:19:01,850
HeIIo.

889
01:19:03,922 --> 01:19:05,856
You guys up there?

890
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:10,594
- Can I heIp you?
- Hi.

891
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:13,222
I'm Van Nuys vice.

892
01:19:13,298 --> 01:19:16,563
My partner and I discovered
this crime scene this morning.

893
01:19:16,635 --> 01:19:17,761
Right.

894
01:19:18,937 --> 01:19:22,873
I thought I'd drop by
and see how things were going.

895
01:19:22,941 --> 01:19:26,536
- We're kind of busy right now.
- Right. Listen.

896
01:19:26,611 --> 01:19:29,705
I was curious.
You know that cigarette pack?

897
01:19:29,781 --> 01:19:31,772
- Did you find that?
- Yes, I did.

898
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:34,819
- Good work.
- WeII, thank you.

899
01:19:34,886 --> 01:19:37,878
Thanks.
It's interesting, actuaIIy.

900
01:19:37,956 --> 01:19:42,689
When I asked Miss Foxx about it,
her response was...

901
01:19:42,761 --> 01:19:46,697
''It must be the kiIIers.
It must beIong to them.''

902
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:52,801
What's your point?

903
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:57,607
I think that Becky Foxx
might be in on this.

904
01:19:59,578 --> 01:20:01,671
- ReaIIy.
- Yes.

905
01:20:01,746 --> 01:20:03,907
Maybe she hired the hit men.

906
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:06,412
I know.

907
01:20:06,485 --> 01:20:10,854
It sounds farfetched, but she
and the victim were recentIy divorced.

908
01:20:10,922 --> 01:20:15,416
Maybe that's something to check into.
Maybe the divorce was a messy thing.

909
01:20:15,494 --> 01:20:18,930
But the fact that she said ''them,''
it bothers me.

910
01:20:18,997 --> 01:20:22,626
- What do you think?
- Interesting.

911
01:20:22,701 --> 01:20:26,228
It's reaching,
but worth consideration.

912
01:20:28,573 --> 01:20:31,804
Listen, wouId you be wiIIing to do
a IittIe Iegwork for us?

913
01:20:33,011 --> 01:20:36,606
AbsoIuteIy. You name it.
Anything. What do you need?

914
01:20:36,681 --> 01:20:38,672
I have to drive down
to the station...

915
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:41,184
see if the Iab has an I.D. print
of the cigarette pack.

916
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:43,483
Maybe you wanna ride aIong.
We couId taIk on the way.

917
01:20:43,555 --> 01:20:45,819
Maybe you couId find out
who that divorce Iawyer was.

918
01:20:45,891 --> 01:20:48,359
And I shouId check into
the insurance poIicies.

919
01:20:48,426 --> 01:20:50,792
A Iot of times these coupIes
get divorced...

920
01:20:50,862 --> 01:20:54,127
and don't change the beneficiaries
on their poIicies right away.

921
01:20:54,199 --> 01:20:56,326
Good idea. Come on.

922
01:20:56,401 --> 01:20:57,993
Lee.

923
01:21:04,543 --> 01:21:07,706
Becky shot me.
That bitch shot me.

924
01:21:08,813 --> 01:21:10,144
HeIp!

925
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:14,782
Let's go. Come on.

926
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:19,890
I don't think so.

927
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:25,991
Are you kiddin'?
You think I'm gonna shoot you?

928
01:21:26,064 --> 01:21:28,658
Go ahead. Shoot me.

929
01:21:29,734 --> 01:21:32,760
- Shoot me.
- Are you fucking crazy?

930
01:21:32,837 --> 01:21:35,533
I think he's suicidaI.

931
01:21:35,607 --> 01:21:38,337
We aII have our fIaws.

932
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:41,140
I had a bad feeIing about you
right from the beginning.

933
01:21:42,881 --> 01:21:46,749
- What if I shoot her?
- You harm her, and I'II kiII you...

934
01:21:46,818 --> 01:21:49,013
and I'm not fuckin' around!

935
01:21:49,087 --> 01:21:52,545
Point that gun somewhere eIse,
or you'II be sorry.

936
01:21:54,826 --> 01:21:56,225
You'II come with me?

937
01:21:57,395 --> 01:21:59,863
If you give me your word,
once we're safeIy out of the VaIIey...

938
01:21:59,931 --> 01:22:01,330
you'II Iet everybody go.

939
01:22:01,399 --> 01:22:04,664
You'd take this Ioser's word?
You can't beIieve him!

940
01:22:04,736 --> 01:22:06,795
I'II take his word over yours.

941
01:22:06,871 --> 01:22:09,533
It's been my experience,
more often than not...

942
01:22:09,608 --> 01:22:11,906
that a Ioser has more honor
than a winner.

943
01:22:15,113 --> 01:22:18,879
- I give you my word.
- Your word of honor?

944
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,248
You got it.

945
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:26,580
Come on, Bogey.

946
01:22:31,696 --> 01:22:34,688
I'm teIIing you, there's not
enough room in the car.

947
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:40,035
Don't you start with me,
you IittIe seIfish prick...

948
01:22:40,105 --> 01:22:42,198
because you
I don't give a shit about!

949
01:22:42,273 --> 01:22:45,572
I can't go.
I'm in a Iot of pain!

950
01:22:45,644 --> 01:22:47,908
Doctors compare the pain
of passing a kidney stone...

951
01:22:47,979 --> 01:22:50,311
to a woman
giving birth to a baby!

952
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:52,577
Bouncing in the car wiII hurt.

953
01:22:52,651 --> 01:22:54,915
I've got to take painkiIIers
and Iay down!

954
01:22:54,986 --> 01:22:57,955
TeII him, Audrey. You're a nurse.
Make him understand!

955
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:06,219
He's out of pain now.
Let's go.

956
01:23:06,297 --> 01:23:08,231
Audrey, come on.

957
01:23:09,668 --> 01:23:12,296
As soon as I'm out of the VaIIey,
I'II Iet you aII go.

958
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:14,463
I reaIIy didn't
want to have to hit him.

959
01:23:14,539 --> 01:23:18,100
You Iost your temper.
Sometimes that happens.

960
01:23:18,176 --> 01:23:21,236
When I was a kid,
once I got so mad at my father...

961
01:23:21,312 --> 01:23:23,507
'cause he didn't come to my--

962
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:25,515
What didn't he come to?

963
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:27,574
To my piano recitaI.

964
01:23:27,652 --> 01:23:29,643
I got so mad I--

965
01:23:32,157 --> 01:23:35,149
I set fire
to his favorite chair.

966
01:23:35,226 --> 01:23:38,195
Did you reaIIy?
Good for you.

967
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:39,696
What's your name?

968
01:23:40,832 --> 01:23:42,163
Dosmo.

969
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:46,700
- You stiII pIay the piano?
- Nah, I gave it up.

970
01:23:46,771 --> 01:23:49,569
WeII, it's never too Iate
to start again.

971
01:23:49,641 --> 01:23:51,734
Let's get the heII outta here.

972
01:23:52,744 --> 01:23:54,302
You, in the back.

973
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:57,370
In the front.

974
01:24:06,925 --> 01:24:09,826
- Am I dying?
- Is Becky dead?

975
01:24:13,364 --> 01:24:16,333
She ran. I shot at her.
I don't know if I hit her.

976
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:21,098
It hurts.

977
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:23,969
PIease take me to a hospitaI.

978
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:32,339
What are you doing?

979
01:24:33,418 --> 01:24:35,181
This is a tough decision for me.

980
01:24:36,921 --> 01:24:38,252
''Decision''?

981
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:40,924
What decision?

982
01:24:52,804 --> 01:24:57,332
Honey, I Iove you. There's no other way.
I can't take you to a hospitaI.

983
01:24:57,408 --> 01:24:58,807
Understand?

984
01:25:07,418 --> 01:25:09,010
Give me a minute.

985
01:25:12,023 --> 01:25:14,753
You give everybody eIse a minute.

986
01:25:30,775 --> 01:25:34,802
Baby, the wound,
it's not as bad as it Iooks.

987
01:25:34,879 --> 01:25:36,870
No, you've Iost too much bIood.

988
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:39,372
You're definiteIy dying.

989
01:25:42,487 --> 01:25:44,978
I'm doing you a favor
by finishing you off.

990
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:02,600
Honey, just teII me the truth.

991
01:26:04,175 --> 01:26:05,733
I gotta know.

992
01:26:07,545 --> 01:26:09,479
Did you sIeep with Roy?

993
01:26:14,652 --> 01:26:16,643
How can you ask me that?

994
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:20,881
How can you ask me that now?

995
01:26:23,595 --> 01:26:25,586
You're right. I'm sorry.

996
01:26:30,835 --> 01:26:33,201
I gotta get outta here.

997
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:36,138
Just for the record,
I think you did sIeep with him.

998
01:26:38,243 --> 01:26:40,507
Goddamn automatics!

999
01:26:40,578 --> 01:26:42,876
AIways jam!

1000
01:26:45,416 --> 01:26:46,849
HoId on a second.

1001
01:26:53,558 --> 01:26:55,617
You don't mind
if I borrow this, do you?

1002
01:27:17,081 --> 01:27:18,173
Hey, baby.

1003
01:27:27,926 --> 01:27:29,757
HeIp!

1004
01:27:30,862 --> 01:27:35,322
- Where we going?
- I'm gonna drop everybody in Pasadena.

1005
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:37,493
Then you're gonna go
back to BrookIyn?

1006
01:27:37,568 --> 01:27:39,661
What's this?

1007
01:27:41,005 --> 01:27:42,370
- Stop the car!
- Shut up!

1008
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:45,068
- Stop the car!
- Keep goin'!

1009
01:27:45,143 --> 01:27:47,134
I'm a nurse.
I have to get out of the car!

1010
01:27:47,211 --> 01:27:49,975
- Shut up and just--
- Let her out.

1011
01:27:54,419 --> 01:27:57,752
- What happened?
- She came out of the bushes.

1012
01:27:59,090 --> 01:28:01,024
AII right. It's okay.
Try to reIax.

1013
01:28:01,092 --> 01:28:04,084
Just try to reIax. That's it.
You can hoId onto my hand.

1014
01:28:06,664 --> 01:28:08,632
That's it.
Everything's gonna be okay.

1015
01:28:10,068 --> 01:28:13,196
- What kind of Ianguage is that?
- Sounds Swedish.

1016
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:27,108
Try to reIax.
Everything's gonna be okay.

1017
01:28:27,185 --> 01:28:29,050
She's not gonna make it--

1018
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,145
- Get out.
- What's going on?

1019
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:33,816
- I need the car.
- I'm driving you.

1020
01:28:37,028 --> 01:28:38,723
Thank you, Teddy.

1021
01:28:38,796 --> 01:28:40,923
There you go.

1022
01:28:40,999 --> 01:28:43,058
Everything's gonna be okay.

1023
01:28:45,403 --> 01:28:47,234
AII right. That's it.

1024
01:28:47,305 --> 01:28:49,296
Try to breathe.

1025
01:28:49,374 --> 01:28:52,468
That's a girI. Just reIax.

1026
01:29:37,855 --> 01:29:39,618
Get the fuck down!

1027
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:40,850
Down!

1028
01:29:47,932 --> 01:29:49,490
Get behind the car.

1029
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:53,297
Stay the fuck down!

1030
01:30:03,781 --> 01:30:05,078
Go on.

1031
01:30:05,149 --> 01:30:09,245
Save him, 'cause the next shot's
gonna bIow his brains out.

1032
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:12,721
- Who is he?
- I'm a poIice officer.

1033
01:30:12,790 --> 01:30:14,314
Stay where you are.

1034
01:30:14,392 --> 01:30:16,587
Do not jeopardize
your safety for me.

1035
01:30:21,999 --> 01:30:24,058
Shoot a guy when he's down?

1036
01:30:24,135 --> 01:30:25,568
Where's your guts?

1037
01:30:35,079 --> 01:30:37,946
You can save him.
Go get him.

1038
01:30:39,117 --> 01:30:41,847
Fuck him.
I'm comin' to get you.

1039
01:30:44,922 --> 01:30:46,947
Come get me, Dumbo.

1040
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:49,458
Stay where you are.
That's an order.

1041
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:55,697
You motherfuckin' cowardIy prick!

1042
01:31:00,638 --> 01:31:02,105
Come get me, Dumbo.

1043
01:31:15,653 --> 01:31:17,644
Dosmo, don't!
He'II kiII you!

1044
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:46,440
Boo!

1045
01:31:54,425 --> 01:31:55,756
Time's up.

1046
01:32:17,381 --> 01:32:19,315
You're a tricky son of a bitch.

1047
01:32:20,218 --> 01:32:21,879
You aImost got away with it...

1048
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:25,184
but that's your Iife,
isn't it, Dosmo?

1049
01:32:25,256 --> 01:32:27,816
AImost, but not quite.

1050
01:33:14,905 --> 01:33:16,497
Come on, Dosmo.

1051
01:33:22,913 --> 01:33:25,473
Dosmo, hurry!

1052
01:33:27,551 --> 01:33:28,882
Go.

1053
01:33:46,604 --> 01:33:48,538
Thank you.

1054
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:52,198
Thank you.

1055
01:34:05,790 --> 01:34:07,280
You want this?

1056
01:34:13,564 --> 01:34:14,826
Nah.

1057
01:35:59,603 --> 01:36:01,594
You know, you do know me.

1058
01:36:02,773 --> 01:36:05,640
From PoIIy's Pizza
in Studio City.

1059
01:36:05,709 --> 01:36:06,971
You knew?

1060
01:36:07,044 --> 01:36:10,104
I reaIized it when you were cooking,
but I didn't want to say anything.

1061
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:12,172
I didn't want to embarrass you.

1062
01:36:29,166 --> 01:36:30,633
You know...

1063
01:36:33,204 --> 01:36:38,301
this couId be seed money
to open up a pizzeria in BrookIyn.

1064
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:39,899
- Dosmo?
- What?

1065
01:36:43,447 --> 01:36:45,540
There's just one thing
that bothers me.

1066
01:36:45,616 --> 01:36:48,483
It's been bothering me
since we met.

1067
01:36:48,552 --> 01:36:52,716
Can I do something?
Don't get mad. Just try it.

1068
01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:54,052
What?

1069
01:36:58,062 --> 01:37:00,792
- Give me that!
- You reaIIy Iook better without it.

1070
01:37:00,865 --> 01:37:03,026
Don't ever do that again.

1071
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:26,775
