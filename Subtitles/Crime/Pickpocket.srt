1
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:17,101
The style of this film is
not that of a thriller.

2
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:19,601
The author attempts to explain,
in pictures and sounds

3
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:22,601
the nightmare of a young man,
forced by his weakness

4
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:29,101
into an adventure for which he was not made.

5
00:00:29,102 --> 00:00:33,101
Yet this adventure, by strange paths,
brings together two souls,

6
00:00:33,102 --> 00:00:39,589
which otherwise might
never have been united.

7
00:02:01,557 --> 00:02:04,026
<i>Men who do these things keep silent...

8
00:02:04,027 --> 00:02:06,378
<i>those who talk haven't done them.

9
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:08,493
<i>Yet, I have done them.

10
00:02:35,874 --> 00:02:38,054
<i>I was now determined.

11
00:02:39,755 --> 00:02:41,035
<i>But would I be bold enough?

12
00:03:31,064 --> 00:03:32,981
<i>I had better quit.

13
00:04:56,614 --> 00:04:59,346
<i>I thought I was mastering the world.

14
00:05:07,796 --> 00:05:10,538
<i>One minute later I was caught.

15
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:22,248
You're not sure at all!

16
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:25,893
That's why we're not holding you.

17
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,434
<i>I wanted to set my ideas to rights.

18
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:25,033
<i>I felt dog-tired, and slept like a log.

19
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,029
<i>I hadn't seen my mother for a long time.

20
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:50,930
<i>I was hesitating...

21
00:06:56,621 --> 00:06:58,079
Wait!

22
00:06:59,134 --> 00:07:00,871
I've got the key.

23
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,097
Who are you..?

24
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:10,274
Jeanne, a neighbour.

25
00:07:11,544 --> 00:07:13,205
How is she?

26
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:15,350
Not well. She's worrying.

27
00:07:16,777 --> 00:07:18,044
She needs many things.

28
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:20,438
She needs you.

29
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,007
Please hand this to her.

30
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:34,276
You're not going to kiss her?

31
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:37,423
Good-bye Jeanne.

32
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,296
Will you come back?

33
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:42,104
Yes... yes.

34
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,237
<i>Jacques was a nice and honest boy.

35
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,189
<i>I'd avoided him of late. But tonight...

36
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:07,654
I'm jobless. I'd do anything.

37
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:11,279
Got any addresses?

38
00:08:11,653 --> 00:08:13,393
Pocket money..?

39
00:08:16,123 --> 00:08:17,317
I'm serious.

40
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:21,057
All right... once more.

41
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:24,452
You're clever with your hands.

42
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:26,363
When one can wait...

43
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:29,117
...and accepts what is offered...

44
00:08:29,397 --> 00:08:35,259
...one's entitled to a new suit and tie.

45
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,819
<i>At first, I hadn't recognized him.

46
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,575
<i>I held out my hand.

47
00:08:41,616 --> 00:08:42,728
You recognize me..?

48
00:08:46,595 --> 00:08:48,432
<i>I may appear careless.

49
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:50,507
<i>But I'd nothing to fear.

50
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,238
Are there so many thieves?

51
00:08:56,423 --> 00:08:58,521
Yes, many.

52
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:01,145
An innumerable variety of them.

53
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:03,009
All robberies aren't important.

54
00:09:03,372 --> 00:09:06,793
Poverty may be an excuse.

55
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:08,271
Of course.

56
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:12,237
Can't there be thefts
which would be forgiven?

57
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:16,455
You've got your theory.

58
00:09:19,678 --> 00:09:20,578
Explain it.

59
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,708
It isn't new.

60
00:09:24,674 --> 00:09:25,912
Tell me all the same.

61
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:32,724
Couldn't it be admitted that clever men...

62
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,470
...able to achieve great things...

63
00:09:35,301 --> 00:09:37,231
...thus indispensable to society...

64
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,197
...might be free in certain cases...

65
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:42,425
...to break the law?

66
00:09:44,606 --> 00:09:47,510
It'd be hard. And dangerous.

67
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:51,336
Society would profit by it.

68
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,907
Who'd pick out those clever men?

69
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:56,876
Themselves. Their conscience.

70
00:09:57,934 --> 00:10:00,667
What man doesn't think he's clever?

71
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,885
It'd only be for the first four
steps. Then they'd stop.

72
00:10:07,217 --> 00:10:09,180
They'd never stop, believe me.

73
00:10:10,683 --> 00:10:13,665
A kind of useful thief, a benefactor?

74
00:10:14,464 --> 00:10:16,885
That'd be topsy-turvy-dom.

75
00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:21,190
As it is so already,
it'd put it right again.

76
00:10:36,408 --> 00:10:38,254
Michel, can't you explain?

77
00:10:37,885 --> 00:10:39,684
I just did it.

78
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:42,072
They acknowledged their mistake.

79
00:10:42,127 --> 00:10:43,105
They apologized.

80
00:10:43,455 --> 00:10:44,862
Of course.

81
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:46,696
You should've kept quiet...

82
00:10:47,164 --> 00:10:50,453
...or thought over twice.

83
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,621
It's you who forced me to talk.

84
00:10:53,781 --> 00:10:55,542
But it doesn't make any difference.

85
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:56,610
The addresses..?

86
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:05,075
Will you go?

87
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:37,702
<i>Was I really expecting something?

88
00:11:44,597 --> 00:11:47,338
<i>But I hated the idea of going home.

89
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:15,869
<i>Why did Fate force me to watch that man?

90
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:42,001
<i>Of course, the wallet was there.

91
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,837
<i>How was I to pick it?

92
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:51,046
<i>I knew it'd be hard.

93
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:55,754
<i>My hands were trembling...

94
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:00,965
<i>...my heart was beating hard.

95
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:52,839
<i>The first success encouraged me.

96
00:15:52,755 --> 00:15:55,143
<i>It was due more to chance than cleverness.

97
00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:23,904
He can't swallow your social theories.

98
00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:25,403
He's only interested in you.

99
00:16:26,311 --> 00:16:27,711
Did he ask you questions.

100
00:16:27,982 --> 00:16:31,383
Don't worry. Now he knows who you are.

101
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,981
What about work?

102
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:37,307
I don't need anything.

103
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:40,792
You're crazy! Who can live on nothing?

104
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,784
Where are you going..?

105
00:17:08,174 --> 00:17:12,724
<i>I always travelled on different lines.

106
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:22,937
<i>It went on for a whole week.

107
00:17:23,183 --> 00:17:26,587
<i>The booty wasn't worth the risks.

108
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:49,424
Give me my wallet back!

109
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:56,368
Want me to call the police?

110
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,998
<i>I stayed home the following days...

111
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,876
<i>...going out only to eat.

112
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,865
This lady was looking for you.

113
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:48,523
Switch on!

114
00:19:51,463 --> 00:19:54,007
See where our genius dwells!

115
00:19:56,826 --> 00:19:58,379
It's my mother, isn't it?

116
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:00,843
She's very ill.

117
00:20:00,844 --> 00:20:04,540
She keeps repeating:
"Why did he refuse to see me?"

118
00:20:08,183 --> 00:20:09,288
Did you..?

119
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,440
You must come.

120
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,104
Thank you, Jeanne.

121
00:20:17,673 --> 00:20:18,627
Will you?

122
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,327
Do you want me to go?

123
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:25,604
Yes. Go with Jeanne.

124
00:20:25,912 --> 00:20:26,324
You're selfish.

125
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,993
And you claim you love your mother!

126
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:31,473
I do. More than myself.
...Go away now.

127
00:20:34,172 --> 00:20:35,664
You're queer...

128
00:21:06,838 --> 00:21:08,638
What do you want? Who are you?

129
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,784
<i>I had to know.

130
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,430
<i>15 minutes later, we were friends.

131
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,709
Come along!

132
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:33,605
<i>There, in the cafe, he taught
me most of his tricks...

133
00:22:33,647 --> 00:22:36,689
<i>...kindly, without the smallest hesitation.

134
00:22:48,364 --> 00:22:51,745
<i>I had to make my fingers supple.

135
00:23:07,922 --> 00:23:10,925
<i>For reflexes, pinball
was excellent training.

136
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:28,823
<i>I went home only to sleep.

137
00:24:01,383 --> 00:24:05,019
<i>How long had it been here?

138
00:24:05,665 --> 00:24:07,923
COME QUICKLY. JEANNE

139
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:42,769
<i>She was sleeping. Peacefully.

140
00:25:00,093 --> 00:25:04,248
I won't ask any questions, you dislike it.

141
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:08,331
I thought I was boring you.
Now I understand.

142
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:11,988
Your friend told me about you.

143
00:25:12,837 --> 00:25:14,575
Did he speak ill of me?

144
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,002
I wouldn't have let him.

145
00:25:17,094 --> 00:25:19,129
No. He likes you and esteems you.

146
00:25:21,878 --> 00:25:23,592
My worrying was silly.

147
00:25:23,593 --> 00:25:28,023
Clever as you are, you'll
succeed whenever you want.

148
00:25:28,482 --> 00:25:31,157
I want it now, to make you happy.

149
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,853
I'm going away, my son.

150
00:25:33,854 --> 00:25:35,263
I'm leaving you.

151
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:40,360
No! You'll get up in a few days.

152
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,532
The doc said it. Didn't he, Jeanne?

153
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,467
I'm sure.

154
00:27:08,328 --> 00:27:10,444
Papers, letters, a few photos.

155
00:27:11,751 --> 00:27:15,312
It's all over. And no going back.

156
00:27:22,804 --> 00:27:23,589
Are you leaving?

157
00:27:23,928 --> 00:27:25,982
Yes, to pick up my sister at school.

158
00:27:27,131 --> 00:27:30,719
Jeanne, do you think
we are to be judged.

159
00:27:31,788 --> 00:27:35,126
Yes. But don't fear for her. She was perfect.

160
00:27:38,513 --> 00:27:41,210
Judged..? After what Law.

161
00:27:41,211 --> 00:27:42,263
That's absurd!

162
00:27:47,108 --> 00:27:48,552
Don't you believe in anything?

163
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:55,225
Yes... in God... for 3 minutes.

164
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:04,151
<i>A week later I entered a well-known bank..

165
00:28:04,152 --> 00:28:07,480
<i>...and sat in the hall.

166
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,355
<i>I got frightened.

167
00:29:37,888 --> 00:29:38,870
<i>He escaped.

168
00:30:33,515 --> 00:30:35,830
<i>Later, we shared the loot.

169
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:37,607
<i>We could lay out the notes openly.

170
00:30:53,847 --> 00:30:56,185
Next time, we'll be three, not two.

171
00:30:59,329 --> 00:30:59,940
Understood?

172
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,830
Completely.

173
00:31:02,484 --> 00:31:05,604
<i>We didn't talk much. He never
knew more about me...

174
00:31:05,605 --> 00:31:08,010
<i>...then I learned about him.

175
00:31:24,823 --> 00:31:26,295
Searching my things?

176
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:35,319
Where have you taken it?

177
00:31:36,525 --> 00:31:37,738
There, on the table.

178
00:31:42,488 --> 00:31:43,984
Those thieves are base.

179
00:31:44,421 --> 00:31:45,533
Sluggards!

180
00:31:48,466 --> 00:31:51,837
Barrington wasn't lazy. He
used to read whole nights.

181
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,242
To mislead his rich friends.

182
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,339
And rob them.

183
00:31:57,551 --> 00:31:58,876
Wasn't he filthy?

184
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,199
Come on... let's go out.

185
00:32:14,506 --> 00:32:17,544
He was brave. In his day, thieves were hanged.

186
00:32:18,598 --> 00:32:19,478
Now, the jail...

187
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,508
You don't know what a jail is.

188
00:32:23,762 --> 00:32:24,773
I can imagine.

189
00:32:24,962 --> 00:32:26,285
It's impossible.

190
00:32:29,785 --> 00:32:30,641
Would you lend it to me.

191
00:32:30,694 --> 00:32:31,812
If you like.

192
00:32:52,997 --> 00:32:54,245
Still the same ideas?

193
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:55,032
Yes, still.

194
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:00,457
No! Whatever you may think...

195
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:03,506
...pickpockets will never improve mankind.

196
00:33:03,806 --> 00:33:04,921
I never said that.

197
00:33:05,595 --> 00:33:06,711
It's crazy.

198
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,849
Do you think there are
many people among them...

199
00:33:13,918 --> 00:33:14,561
What people...

200
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:17,205
Those who should be given
leave to do anything.

201
00:33:20,689 --> 00:33:22,978
How can we know?
They're never caught.

202
00:33:23,463 --> 00:33:25,694
They exist, since you affirm it.

203
00:33:27,032 --> 00:33:28,684
Maybe you know one of them?

204
00:33:30,448 --> 00:33:32,908
If I did, I wouldn't tell you.

205
00:33:34,163 --> 00:33:34,990
Obviously.

206
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:39,764
Allow me.

207
00:33:45,072 --> 00:33:46,887
"Barrington". Don't know him.

208
00:33:49,584 --> 00:33:51,531
Maybe one of your superior men?

209
00:33:53,025 --> 00:33:55,173
No. But if you want to read it...

210
00:33:56,994 --> 00:33:58,962
Bring the book to me one of these days.

211
00:34:07,184 --> 00:34:09,278
Of course, he suspects me.

212
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:12,183
You too, admit it.

213
00:34:13,734 --> 00:34:14,541
I... what?

214
00:34:15,256 --> 00:34:16,401
Nothing.

215
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:20,798
Don't go there!

216
00:34:21,076 --> 00:34:22,592
Yes. Give it to me.

217
00:34:25,526 --> 00:34:26,097
All right. Go...

218
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:26,920
...if you think it's fun.

219
00:34:38,612 --> 00:34:41,877
<i>He made me wait a long time.

220
00:34:55,225 --> 00:34:56,713
I'm bringing the book.

221
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:00,161
What book?

222
00:35:01,798 --> 00:35:02,920
Oh yes. "Barrington".

223
00:35:08,568 --> 00:35:10,408
You're interested in Barrington?

224
00:35:11,632 --> 00:35:12,760
In everything.

225
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:15,955
Of course... a young writer.

226
00:35:16,934 --> 00:35:19,175
<i>He was making fun of me.

227
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:24,110
He used to make hooks
to force into pockets.

228
00:35:37,564 --> 00:35:38,691
Here...

229
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:44,249
Nuremberg culler made 15 of them.

230
00:36:01,947 --> 00:36:02,918
Excuse me...

231
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:12,519
Keep it.

232
00:36:13,124 --> 00:36:14,229
Good-bye!

233
00:36:21,939 --> 00:36:23,506
<i>Why hadn't I suspected it?

234
00:36:23,507 --> 00:36:24,543
<i>It was a snare.

235
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,752
<i>If I hurried home,
I might perhaps catch them.

236
00:37:17,805 --> 00:37:19,224
<i>There was no disorder.

237
00:37:24,268 --> 00:37:25,675
<i>Everything was okay.

238
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:45,902
<i>I needed help this time...

239
00:37:46,261 --> 00:37:48,841
<i>Rather more skill than I had.

240
00:38:17,951 --> 00:38:20,815
<i>One finger keeps the strap from turning...

241
00:38:20,957 --> 00:38:23,940
<i>...while the thumb opens the buckle.

242
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:27,027
<i>I practiced it often.

243
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:46,704
<i>On Sunday, I was to go out
with Jacques and Jeanne.

244
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,187
How pretty!... Where's Jeanne?

245
00:39:07,293 --> 00:39:08,654
Waiting downstairs.

246
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,199
You're sad.

247
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,642
You're not living in this world.

248
00:39:50,573 --> 00:39:52,690
You're not interested in anything.

249
00:39:54,356 --> 00:39:55,481
Let's go, Jeanne.

250
00:39:55,908 --> 00:39:57,032
Coming, Michel?

251
00:39:58,164 --> 00:39:59,211
Where are you going?

252
00:39:59,851 --> 00:40:01,078
We intend to fly.

253
00:40:01,335 --> 00:40:02,748
I'll remain here.

254
00:40:43,327 --> 00:40:44,411
Where's Michel?

255
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,595
<i>I had run... and fallen.

256
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:46,468
Here you are!

257
00:41:50,996 --> 00:41:52,207
I was so scared.

258
00:41:53,988 --> 00:41:55,127
Scared? Why?

259
00:41:57,255 --> 00:41:58,294
Just scared.

260
00:42:00,294 --> 00:42:01,630
Explain yourself.

261
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,779
You hurt yourself.

262
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:16,526
A little. It's nothing.

263
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,866
Where's Jeanne?

264
00:42:21,678 --> 00:42:25,001
I took her home.
But I can go and fetch her.

265
00:42:29,128 --> 00:42:31,910
You love her, don't you?

266
00:42:36,646 --> 00:42:37,655
Does she love you?

267
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,419
You should present her...

268
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,072
...with a few gifts, shouldn't you?

269
00:43:06,196 --> 00:43:07,445
<i>The watch was splendid.

270
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:19,085
<i>My boldness had no limits now.

271
00:43:19,383 --> 00:43:21,429
<i>My associates and I
were on excellent terms.

272
00:43:21,729 --> 00:43:23,829
<i>Of course, it couldn't last.

273
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:18,977
<i>Where had I met him..?

274
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,120
What's the matter with you?

275
00:48:02,822 --> 00:48:06,119
Jeanne summoned by the police? Why?

276
00:48:08,574 --> 00:48:09,653
I don't know.

277
00:48:10,462 --> 00:48:12,214
What should she do?

278
00:48:12,532 --> 00:48:14,672
She must go there, of course.

279
00:48:16,017 --> 00:48:16,774
Is that all?

280
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,823
I'm warning you so that you
can take some steps?

281
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:21,998
What steps..?

282
00:48:25,558 --> 00:48:26,714
Don't detain me.

283
00:49:11,043 --> 00:49:12,394
<i>Had they seen me?

284
00:49:13,491 --> 00:49:15,608
<i>I mustn't seem to be hiding.

285
00:49:56,438 --> 00:49:57,676
<i>I hadn't heard him.

286
00:50:01,444 --> 00:50:02,191
It's you!

287
00:50:03,436 --> 00:50:06,915
I came three days ago.

288
00:50:07,767 --> 00:50:08,941
I was out for a breather.

289
00:50:09,174 --> 00:50:12,465
You're right. It's unhealthy
to remain in here...

290
00:50:13,288 --> 00:50:15,183
...immersed in your books.

291
00:50:25,926 --> 00:50:27,669
You suspect me, I know.

292
00:50:28,249 --> 00:50:30,431
If you think you can arrest me, do so...

293
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:34,868
Manacle me...
but don't drive me crazy.

294
00:50:35,564 --> 00:50:37,330
Don't provoke me all the time.

295
00:50:39,093 --> 00:50:41,290
On the contrary, I've left you alone.

296
00:50:41,874 --> 00:50:43,691
Don't play with me, laugh at me!

297
00:50:45,354 --> 00:50:46,293
That's enough!

298
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,515
Don't shout. Calm down.

299
00:50:52,725 --> 00:50:56,302
Control yourself, please.

300
00:50:57,371 --> 00:50:58,448
And sit down.

301
00:51:01,721 --> 00:51:02,997
I'm here...

302
00:51:03,325 --> 00:51:05,147
because  feel an interest in you.

303
00:51:05,555 --> 00:51:06,887
I don't care a damn!

304
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,275
...and I want you to be informed:

305
00:51:11,397 --> 00:51:15,083
One year ago,
a complaint was lodged...

306
00:51:15,767 --> 00:51:17,313
...(you and I hadn't met yet)...

307
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,804
...by a girl, at her police-station.

308
00:51:21,697 --> 00:51:22,881
What girl?

309
00:51:23,209 --> 00:51:24,020
It's not important.

310
00:51:24,557 --> 00:51:27,768
An old neighbour of hers
had been robbed.

311
00:51:29,941 --> 00:51:31,923
Next day, the complaint
was withdrawn.

312
00:51:32,004 --> 00:51:32,806
Why..?

313
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:37,460
It often happens
that the thief is a relative.

314
00:51:39,524 --> 00:51:41,448
That lady had a son...

315
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:45,700
Robbing one's own mother
isn't really a theft.

316
00:51:46,243 --> 00:51:48,049
Maybe they shared expenses.

317
00:51:49,437 --> 00:51:53,822
But, one month later, that boy
was caught at the races.

318
00:51:54,723 --> 00:51:56,450
Lacking evidence, I let him go.

319
00:51:56,735 --> 00:51:58,712
All this put together...

320
00:52:00,765 --> 00:52:01,910
Who is the boy?

321
00:52:03,878 --> 00:52:04,654
You, of course.

322
00:52:12,477 --> 00:52:13,720
You're wrong.

323
00:52:14,328 --> 00:52:15,832
I'm not wrong.

324
00:52:18,763 --> 00:52:20,101
Funny methods!

325
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:21,601
Leave my methods alone.

326
00:52:26,317 --> 00:52:29,216
If you wanted to be so sure...

327
00:52:29,517 --> 00:52:32,417
...why didn't you send
your men to search my room?

328
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,334
Well, while you were with me...

329
00:52:35,335 --> 00:52:37,139
...your room was searched.

330
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:40,376
And what did they find?

331
00:52:46,558 --> 00:52:47,748
Nothing of course.

332
00:52:51,704 --> 00:52:52,855
You're tiring me!

333
00:53:00,506 --> 00:53:01,624
What do you want?

334
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:03,252
I want you to open your eyes.

335
00:53:03,991 --> 00:53:05,240
They're wide open!

336
00:53:05,723 --> 00:53:06,693
...on yourself.

337
00:53:07,224 --> 00:53:08,865
But I'd lose my time.

338
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:11,459
As to the future...

339
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,643
..."your" future...

340
00:53:13,205 --> 00:53:15,653
Are you a prophet..?
My future isn't your business!

341
00:53:18,007 --> 00:53:19,039
I should say it is.

342
00:53:19,097 --> 00:53:25,814
I should've asked you a few
questions. It was my duty.

343
00:53:28,347 --> 00:53:35,186
On the strength of it,
I'll send you to jail.

344
00:53:35,856 --> 00:53:36,870
Now, good-bye.

345
00:53:43,197 --> 00:53:44,786
What's your purpose?

346
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:47,263
My purpose..?

347
00:53:51,971 --> 00:53:52,919
I want to know!

348
00:54:32,694 --> 00:54:36,456
They asked me who had
withdrawn the complaint.

349
00:54:37,265 --> 00:54:38,627
What did you answer?

350
00:54:38,787 --> 00:54:39,913
That it was your mother.

351
00:54:40,834 --> 00:54:41,755
Is that true?

352
00:54:42,455 --> 00:54:43,118
Yes.

353
00:54:44,374 --> 00:54:47,987
So she knew.
Did you know too, Jeanne?

354
00:54:49,362 --> 00:54:50,437
What..?

355
00:54:52,763 --> 00:54:53,668
And now... you know.

356
00:55:02,677 --> 00:55:04,913
You're sending me crazy,
all of you!

357
00:55:10,085 --> 00:55:12,320
The police asked you about me..?

358
00:55:13,622 --> 00:55:15,220
Your name wasn't mentioned.

359
00:55:15,398 --> 00:55:17,829
But you can see I'm living...

360
00:55:20,549 --> 00:55:21,884
...without working.

361
00:55:25,123 --> 00:55:26,789
And you don't guess anything?

362
00:55:30,065 --> 00:55:31,018
Think it over.

363
00:55:35,235 --> 00:55:36,134
It's you?

364
00:55:36,938 --> 00:55:38,558
Yes. And I'll go to jail.

365
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,098
My God!

366
00:55:48,902 --> 00:55:51,777
There's no evidence,
so they'll have to let me out.

367
00:55:52,237 --> 00:55:53,958
How could you...?

368
00:55:54,961 --> 00:55:57,187
There's nothing lower.
Didn't you know?

369
00:56:00,177 --> 00:56:02,375
One can do a low action knowingly.

370
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:03,378
But why..?

371
00:56:06,265 --> 00:56:07,171
I couldn't achieve anything.

372
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:10,272
It sent me mad!

373
00:56:12,216 --> 00:56:13,231
There are a thousand ways.

374
00:56:14,326 --> 00:56:15,792
Of course, you accept.

375
00:56:16,147 --> 00:56:19,927
You accept a father who drinks,
a mother who elopes...

376
00:56:20,564 --> 00:56:21,999
...and the burden is yours.

377
00:56:22,966 --> 00:56:23,891
That's that.

378
00:56:26,096 --> 00:56:26,864
Meaning..?

379
00:56:29,216 --> 00:56:32,133
I don't know.
Maybe there's a reason.

380
00:56:37,449 --> 00:56:40,077
Jeanne, how naive you are!

381
00:56:42,937 --> 00:56:44,349
Speak honestly...

382
00:56:46,915 --> 00:56:48,605
...do you think I'm a thief?

383
00:56:53,397 --> 00:56:54,465
Don't lie!

384
00:56:58,455 --> 00:56:59,535
Yes, I think you are.

385
00:57:01,026 --> 00:57:02,515
Then I won't shake your hand.

386
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:11,578
It's horrible!..

387
00:57:17,908 --> 00:57:18,971
You'll be leaving?

388
00:57:21,975 --> 00:57:23,693
<i>I never thought of it before.

389
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:25,689
No.. no!

390
00:57:46,146 --> 00:57:48,090
<i>I remember I picked
up a suit-case.

391
00:58:02,878 --> 00:58:04,549
<i>I was in a haze.

392
00:58:38,252 --> 00:58:39,934
<i>Would they let me reach the station?

393
00:59:06,403 --> 00:59:07,836
<i>I went right to the window.

394
00:59:51,325 --> 00:59:53,576
<i>I'll never forget that minute.

395
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:19,497
<i>From Milan I went down to Rome.
After that, England.

396
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:23,077
<i>During my 2 years in London,
I was in luck.

397
01:00:23,381 --> 01:00:26,817
<i>But girls and gambling
made me lose most of my money.

398
01:00:27,125 --> 01:00:30,255
<i>I went back to Paris
as broke as before.

399
01:00:45,489 --> 01:00:47,130
<i>I was there again
without knowing how.

400
01:00:54,825 --> 01:00:56,155
<i>The place seemed empty.

401
01:01:13,682 --> 01:01:15,135
<i>Why was I looking at that kid?

402
01:01:24,289 --> 01:01:25,280
Jeanne!

403
01:01:28,341 --> 01:01:29,516
What did your father say?

404
01:01:31,617 --> 01:01:34,480
He took my sister
and everything away.

405
01:01:35,011 --> 01:01:38,005
To have a baby isn't a crime!

406
01:01:38,029 --> 01:01:39,485
It is. I was mad.

407
01:01:41,545 --> 01:01:42,908
Why didn't he marry you?

408
01:01:44,415 --> 01:01:45,652
Because I refused him.

409
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:47,165
You, Jeanne?

410
01:01:48,228 --> 01:01:52,514
I didn't want to dupe him.

411
01:01:53,475 --> 01:01:54,951
Didn't you love him?

412
01:01:57,537 --> 01:01:59,686
No... not enough.

413
01:02:01,172 --> 01:02:02,260
Where is he?

414
01:02:03,395 --> 01:02:04,508
I haven't seen him for three months.

415
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:05,569
Jacques..?

416
01:02:06,293 --> 01:02:07,568
Unbelievable...

417
01:02:19,506 --> 01:02:20,616
I'll help you.

418
01:02:23,022 --> 01:02:24,576
I'll take care of your kid.

419
01:02:29,794 --> 01:02:31,798
No. You must go...

420
01:02:32,978 --> 01:02:34,342
...and never come back here.

421
01:02:35,874 --> 01:02:37,327
I can become honest again.

422
01:02:38,096 --> 01:02:39,387
At least, let me try.

423
01:03:49,636 --> 01:03:52,925
<i>The police didn't bother me
any longer.

424
01:04:21,347 --> 01:04:22,037
Are you playing?

425
01:04:23,698 --> 01:04:24,560
Will you go?

426
01:04:25,478 --> 01:04:26,187
Maybe.

427
01:05:44,222 --> 01:05:45,402
Won anything?

428
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:47,463
Nothing. And you?

429
01:05:49,401 --> 01:05:50,923
Look.

430
01:05:56,128 --> 01:05:57,114
<i>Was I wrong..?

431
01:05:57,923 --> 01:06:01,109
<i>Funny: the winner wasn't
the horse he'd bet on.

432
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,995
<i>I read mischief in his eyes.

433
01:07:37,602 --> 01:07:39,774
Those walls, those bars,
I don't care.

434
01:07:40,224 --> 01:07:41,545
I don't even see them.

435
01:07:43,978 --> 01:07:44,914
It's the idea.

436
01:07:46,499 --> 01:07:47,553
What idea?

437
01:07:49,759 --> 01:07:51,789
I should've been on my guard.

438
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,067
I can't bear that idea.

439
01:08:00,024 --> 01:08:01,207
You're suffering!

440
01:08:02,964 --> 01:08:03,974
I confessed everything.

441
01:08:05,926 --> 01:08:06,968
They'll take it into account.

442
01:08:08,104 --> 01:08:11,448
During the preliminary
investigation, I'll deny it.

443
01:08:17,662 --> 01:08:18,823
Why have you come?

444
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:23,497
I have only you.

445
01:08:24,935 --> 01:08:27,153
Must I admit that I'm bad,
and that you win?

446
01:08:28,772 --> 01:08:30,327
I don't need anyone!

447
01:08:35,773 --> 01:08:36,659
Don't go...

448
01:09:02,063 --> 01:09:04,189
<i>There was something
I hadn't told her.

449
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,344
<i>Why should I live?

450
01:09:08,421 --> 01:09:10,150
<i>I hadn't decided yet.

451
01:09:28,993 --> 01:09:30,277
<i>Jeanne didn't return...

452
01:09:46,384 --> 01:09:52,384
The kid has been
very ill for 3 weeks.

453
01:09:52,484 --> 01:09:58,356
Now he is better and I will return 
soon to see you in prison. Jeanne.

454
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:04,431
<i>When I read that,
my heart beat violently.

455
01:10:54,778 --> 01:10:56,536
<i>Then a sweet light came up.

456
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:18,859
<i>Oh Jeanne, in order to reach you...

457
01:11:19,282 --> 01:11:21,491
<i>...what a strange way I had to take...
