1
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:05,964
My name is Bridget,

2
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,299
I witnessed a murder.

3
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:10,010
Just get up on the stand and
tell the judge what you saw.

4
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,265
- We'll protect you.
- You don't get it.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,431
<i>If Bodaway wants me dead, I'm dead.</i>

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,601
<i>I ran to my sister Siobhan for help.</i>

7
00:00:18,726 --> 00:00:20,395
Siobhan? Siobhan?

8
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:21,438
Siobhan killed herself,

9
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,315
and I assumed her identity.

10
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,775
<i>It was so easy.</i>

11
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:27,402
I saw a way out, and I took it.

12
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:28,654
<i>They all think that I'm her.</i>

13
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,196
<i>Her husband.</i>

14
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,573
- <i>Her lover.</i>
- Make a choice...

15
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:32,574
him or me.

16
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,700
<i>Her best friend.</i>

17
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:35,452
I think Henry's having an affair.

18
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,663
I believe Siobhan Martin
is harboring a fugitive,

19
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,022
<i>and the more I find out</i> <i>about her,</i>

20
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:40,339
<i>the closer I get to Bridget.</i>

21
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,942
Siobhan, we have a problem.

22
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:45,111
Bridget's still alive.

23
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:57,790
♪ Hold me darling, hold me tight ♪

24
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:02,128
♪ I will let you lead with me
tonight ♪

25
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:06,692
♪ hold me, darling... ♪

26
00:01:09,086 --> 00:01:10,278
You're here.

27
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:15,659
Um, have you given
any thought to dinner?

28
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,259
I was thinking about
that Chinese place.

29
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,761
You know, the one around the corner.

30
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:22,541
Siobhan hates that Chinese place
on the corner, Bridget.

31
00:01:24,935 --> 00:01:26,294
What did you just say?

32
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,454
Bridget Kelly.

33
00:01:29,573 --> 00:01:31,049
That's your name, isn't it?

34
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,137
I don't know
what you're talking about.

35
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:41,059
They found your bag
at the bus station.

36
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:43,812
They thought it belonged to Siobhan.

37
00:01:45,956 --> 00:01:48,641
It was full of clothes
that she would never wear.

38
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,901
It didn't make sense.

39
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:51,945
But then I found
this driver's license...

40
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:59,402
...With Siobhan's picture
and Bridget Kelly's name.

41
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:02,497
It's not what you think.

42
00:02:02,663 --> 00:02:04,458
What have you done with Siobhan?

43
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,142
I didn't do anything.

44
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,754
We... we were on the boat,
and she died.

45
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,338
You let her drown.

46
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:13,216
I didn't. I swear.
I-I wanted to save her. I tried.

47
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:15,501
You've lied to us all.

48
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:18,430
Me, Henry, Gemma.

49
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,932
Andrew, I'm so sorry.

50
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:24,627
I never meant to hurt any of you.

51
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:26,605
Don't apologize to me.

52
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,049
Apologize to her.

53
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:40,660
Shiv?

54
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:41,953
You okay?

55
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:44,063
Yeah.

56
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:49,002
You haven't slept well in weeks.

57
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:50,754
This can't be good for the baby.

58
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,907
You know, maybe I should just
get out of the city.

59
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,409
That might be good for me.

60
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,761
I could go to the Hamptons.

61
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,429
By yourself?

62
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:01,030
Just for the weekend.

63
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:03,725
You know, um, I could use
some time on my own.

64
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:07,687
You want to be alone
on your birthday?

65
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,091
Oh, my God, I...

66
00:03:12,142 --> 00:03:15,654
Everything going on, I...
I lost all track of time.

67
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,656
You, forget your birthday?

68
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,076
Look...

69
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,352
I know you're upset
about what happened last year,

70
00:03:23,387 --> 00:03:27,056
but I had hoped you'd give me
a chance to make it up to you.

71
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:30,210
I thought we were supposed
to be making a fresh start.

72
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,111
No, I-I want that, too.

73
00:03:32,162 --> 00:03:35,264
I... I like how things
have been between us lately.

74
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,250
Well, if you want to get away

75
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:39,585
to the Hamptons, let's go.

76
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,098
We can celebrate your birthday
on the beach like we used to.

77
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,475
I'd like that.

78
00:03:46,677 --> 00:03:48,812
I'm sure I could
finish up work early.

79
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,080
We could drive out this afternoon.

80
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,715
There's no reason for you to rush.

81
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:55,068
I... I'll just take
the jitney this morning.

82
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:56,903
The jitney?

83
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:58,655
Yeah.

84
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:05,871
Really, shiv?

85
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,247
I mean, whatever next?

86
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,207
A new found appreciation
for the subway?

87
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:12,961
Just trying to keep you on your toes.

88
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,204
I'll send the car service for you.

89
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,456
In fact, I'll take care
of all the planning.

90
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:18,758
We'll do the usual, huh?

91
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:20,552
Yeah.

92
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,663
You know, I've really missed
these weekends.

93
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,329
♪ ♪

94
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,003
Yeah, he's the one who came over.

95
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,263
We have cameras all over.
Hold on a second.

96
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:06,822
Let me call you back.

97
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,183
When did this come in?

98
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,176
Hamptons PD just e-mailed it over.

99
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,394
Smart move putting the duffel bag

100
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,188
back where you found it.

101
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,773
Looks like she's still in New York.

102
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,716
Only way she could know
about that bag

103
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:18,768
is if her sister told her.

104
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:20,770
Siobhan knows where her sister is.

105
00:05:20,804 --> 00:05:23,240
We're going to find Bridget Kelly.

Hey, Malcolm, it's me.

108
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:50,611
Uh, sorry to keep calling you.

109
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:52,696
Just haven't heard from you.

110
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:54,982
I hope you're not mad at me.

111
00:05:55,016 --> 00:05:56,900
I know you don't want me
staying here,

112
00:05:56,951 --> 00:05:59,319
but I'm doing okay.

113
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:01,572
Really.

00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:05,209
I just hope everything's
okay with you.

Will you call me, please?

116
00:06:08,763 --> 00:06:11,371
I miss you.

117
00:06:26,314 --> 00:06:28,680
Siobhan?

118
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:36,824
You're here early.

119
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:38,826
I pawned off my work on Olivia.

120
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,860
Who wants to be in the city
when you can be on the beach?

121
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:46,197
Water's
so calm today.

122
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:48,074
Can't wait to get the boat out there.

123
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,492
I'll pass on that.

124
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,665
It just... the thought
of it makes me nauseous.

125
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:58,501
Of course... the baby.

126
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,716
Work?

127
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,965
It's just one text, shiv.

128
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:10,307
I promise, what happened last year

129
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:11,809
is not going to happen again.

130
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,933
I should never have left you
at dinner,

131
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,029
no matter what
was going on at the office.

132
00:07:16,064 --> 00:07:17,896
We were in such a bad place.

133
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:21,985
I had no idea
if you even wanted me around.

134
00:07:22,036 --> 00:07:23,693
I...

135
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:25,862
Look.

136
00:07:27,108 --> 00:07:28,656
I am done with work for the weekend.

137
00:07:28,822 --> 00:07:30,700
This year,

138
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:34,913
I'm going to make your birthday
the best birthday ever.

139
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,042
It's been a long time
since anyone's done that for me.

140
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,170
<i>Okay, what you're</i>
<i>talking about is not football.</i>

141
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,473
It's soccer, okay?

142
00:07:43,508 --> 00:07:45,475
And you have to admit
it's kind of boring.

143
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,927
So you're telling me all those games

144
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:48,762
you sat through
cheering and screaming,

145
00:07:48,796 --> 00:07:50,430
you were faking that?

146
00:07:50,464 --> 00:07:52,263
Getting worried.
What else were you faking?

147
00:07:57,856 --> 00:07:59,806
Stay here.

148
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,284
I thought you guys were calling
when you got close.

149
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,005
Sorry. We... we didn't
hear you come in.

150
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,287
We were just having a discussion,

151
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:17,705
and then he wasn't looking,

152
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:18,976
and the vase broke.

153
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,250
No, you threw it at me.

154
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:22,996
Is everything okay?

155
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:24,170
It's fine.

156
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:25,566
It's just a misunderstanding.

157
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,584
We'll pay for the vase.

158
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:29,759
Anyway...
Happy Birthday.

159
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:31,271
Thank you. I...

160
00:08:31,306 --> 00:08:32,723
I didn't realize
you guys were coming.

161
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:34,725
Andrew said we were doing the Siobhan

162
00:08:34,776 --> 00:08:36,266
birthday getaway, like old times.

163
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,344
Assumed you were expecting us.

164
00:08:37,362 --> 00:08:38,601
We were.

165
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:40,770
Didn't think you'd be
letting yourselves in.

166
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:43,189
We can leave.
We should leave.

167
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,168
I was really looking
forward to a weekend away.

168
00:08:45,203 --> 00:08:47,187
No work, no kids.

169
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:49,696
Look, if you guys want
to stay, we'd love

170
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,197
to have you, wouldn't we?

171
00:08:52,293 --> 00:08:53,543
Please, stay.

172
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:56,327
It'll... it'll be a great weekend.

173
00:08:57,882 --> 00:08:59,800
I, um...

174
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,868
I'll go get the bags.

175
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:07,338
Sorry.
Ah, think nothing of it.

176
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:09,593
Bridget Kelly fled from police

177
00:09:09,644 --> 00:09:11,511
in Wyoming on September 6,

178
00:09:11,545 --> 00:09:14,220
the night before she was
scheduled to testify.

179
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:15,399
Now, thanks to the bag

180
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:16,681
you recovered at the bus station,

181
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,391
we know that Kelly was here

182
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,518
in the Hamptons
on or before September 9.

183
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:22,479
Then she disappeared.

184
00:09:23,574 --> 00:09:25,023
Siobhan sent Bridget that letter

185
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,482
long before Bridget was on the run.

186
00:09:26,648 --> 00:09:28,485
And the woman can talk
her way out of anything,

187
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,830
so confronting her about the bag

188
00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:31,863
will more likely than not
get me nowhere.

189
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,868
Unless I have hard evidence...
something that proves

190
00:09:34,902 --> 00:09:36,670
that Martin and Kelly
have been in contact.

191
00:09:36,704 --> 00:09:37,744
If I can find that,

192
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,072
then I have probable cause

193
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,747
for search warrants and phone taps.

194
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,259
And hell, I can even charge Siobhan

195
00:09:42,293 --> 00:09:43,833
with obstruction of justice.

196
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:46,294
Oh. Those eyes you asked me
to put on Siobhan Martin...

197
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,415
came up with an unidentified car
at the Martin house.

198
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:49,547
We ran the plates.

199
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:53,754
Henry and Gemma Butler.

200
00:09:53,788 --> 00:09:54,844
That's very interesting.

201
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,473
Why is that?

202
00:09:56,524 --> 00:09:58,389
Takes a brave woman to share a house

203
00:09:58,555 --> 00:10:00,683
with her husband and her lover.

204
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,020
What was that back there?

205
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:07,482
When Andrew called, I was so excited.

206
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,653
And then Henry and I
fought all the way here.

207
00:10:09,704 --> 00:10:12,278
By the time we arrived,
I was so fed up, I lost it.

208
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:16,943
I'm trying to believe him when
he says he's not cheating.

209
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:20,662
Every bone in my body tells
me he's up to something.

210
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:24,501
I thought coming out here
would be good for us.

211
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:26,376
We used to love the Hamptons.

212
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:30,088
Now we can't even make it
through a two-hour car ride.

213
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,383
If you love him,
you have to fight for him.

214
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,805
You'd tell me if there
was anything I could do, right?

215
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,484
Thanks.

216
00:10:40,518 --> 00:10:42,976
God, I'm sick of hearing me talk
about this.

217
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,602
I am going to check out

218
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:46,139
that adorable little
store around the corner,

219
00:10:46,157 --> 00:10:47,355
pick up something for the twins.

220
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,026
Okay. Think I'm going to finish up,

221
00:10:49,077 --> 00:10:51,328
and see you back at the house.

222
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,572
I want you to know how
much it means to me

223
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,868
that I can talk to you
about all this stuff.

224
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,576
You're an amazing friend.

225
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,160
Like a sister.

226
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:10,878
<i>Hey, Bridget over here!</i>

227
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,552
Oh Siobhan, it's beautiful.

228
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:17,468
One day I'm gonna have one of those.

229
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:19,596
We should buy something
for our birthday.

230
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,014
Mom gave us money.

231
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,598
20 bucks?

232
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:26,513
We'll find something.
Like...

233
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,024
...Those! They're pretty and cheap.

234
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,519
Not cheap enough.

235
00:11:32,537 --> 00:11:34,193
But it's our birthday.

236
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:36,540
I know. We're supposed
to have tons of presents

237
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:37,947
and a crazy party.

238
00:11:38,113 --> 00:11:40,193
I hate being poor.

239
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:43,202
When I get older, I'm going
to have everything I want.

240
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:45,079
I just really want that.

241
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:48,791
We could always buy one and share.

242
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:50,504
I don't want to share.

243
00:11:50,538 --> 00:11:52,038
We won't know whose turn it is.

244
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:53,173
We'll make it simple.

245
00:11:53,207 --> 00:11:54,674
It'll be your turn for a year.

246
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,050
And then on our next birthday,
it'll be my turn.

247
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,968
And then yours.

248
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:00,680
Like, forever?

249
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:02,382
That's kinda cool.

250
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:11,691
Gemma Butler?

251
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:12,742
Can I help you?

252
00:12:12,777 --> 00:12:14,817
I hope so.

253
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:18,782
I have a few questions.

254
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:21,783
About Siobhan Martin?

255
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,744
No, about Bridget Kelly.

256
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,579
Siobhan Martin's twin sister.

257
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,924
You were gone a while.

258
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:40,991
The boys went golfing.

259
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:43,260
And I found a backlog of
six-months of trash magazines.

260
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,012
Did you know that Angelina Jolie used

261
00:12:45,046 --> 00:12:46,557
to let her kids eat crickets?

262
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,561
Why didn't you tell me about Bridget?

263
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:53,022
What?

264
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:54,565
Your twin?

265
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:57,174
An FBI Agent just told me about her,

266
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:00,828
how she's on the run from the police.

267
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:02,490
You spoke to the FBI?

268
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,118
Agent Machado?

269
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,452
What did you tell him?

270
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:08,519
Nothing because I don't know
anything.

271
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,749
I've known you for five years, shiv.

272
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:14,836
I had no idea
you had a sister. A twin?

273
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,462
How do you keep that hidden?

274
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:26,722
We're not a part
of each other's lives.

275
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:29,123
My sister...

276
00:13:29,157 --> 00:13:31,811
Did something unforgivable.

277
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,563
What?

278
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:37,081
She ruined her life.

279
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:42,770
Just... one bad choice after another,

280
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,139
till I didn't even
recognize her anymore.

281
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:49,328
I'm ashamed of what she did.

282
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,667
Do you have any idea where she is?

283
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,339
No.

284
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,428
I should have been able
to help her... save her.

285
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:11,599
Just when I thought I had her back,

286
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:12,852
she was gone.

287
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:15,313
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

288
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:20,485
I haven't told Andrew.

289
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,446
Really? Why?

290
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,279
I met Andrew after the fallout.

291
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:27,798
I didn't know how to bring it up.

292
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,734
I mean, I know I need to tell him,

293
00:14:30,768 --> 00:14:32,413
I just... I'm not ready.

294
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,956
Well, he won't hear it from me.

295
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:39,159
God, Siobhan, all these years,
I never would have guessed.

296
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,996
You're always so excited
about your birthday.

297
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:43,664
But it must have been eating you up

298
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:45,510
not being able to share it
with your sister.

299
00:14:47,752 --> 00:14:49,786
It was our special day.

300
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:53,490
I miss her.

301
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:00,981
I thought I was clear.

302
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:02,944
I don't want to see you.

303
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,053
It's our birthday.

304
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:11,659
Red velvet... your favorite.

305
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,041
You're moving?

306
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,429
Yeah... to New York.

307
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:31,973
I met someone.

308
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,048
Siobhan, you can't just run away.

309
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,185
Don't you dare lecture me on what

310
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:38,271
I can and can't do.

311
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,890
Andrew loves me.

312
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:44,942
I can start over.

313
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:53,953
I never want it back.

314
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:51,052
Bonjour.

315
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:57,892
Excuse me.

316
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,853
Tyler, I've been trying to reach you.

317
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,315
I was busy with work.

318
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,067
You're not working right now.

319
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,058
May I borrow you just for a minute?

320
00:17:08,092 --> 00:17:10,321
Sure.

321
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:19,269
I'm really sorry about how
things ended the other night.

322
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:20,270
I was really sick.

323
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:22,458
Yeah, it's no big deal.

324
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:23,540
Besides, I met Simone.

325
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:24,710
She doesn't speak

326
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:27,244
a lot of English, but then again,

327
00:17:27,278 --> 00:17:28,756
she doesn't have to.

328
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:32,716
Tyler, I like you... a lot.

329
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,345
We had a connection.

330
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,570
Is that how you connect with people...

331
00:17:36,604 --> 00:17:38,933
shove them out of your hotel
room without a second thought?

332
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,479
Look, I got to get back.

333
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:47,942
It was, uh, great meeting you.

334
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:52,363
Have a lovely stay in Paris.

335
00:17:57,158 --> 00:17:59,309
Hello.

336
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:02,331
I hit a snag.

337
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,848
Look who's here.

338
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,051
It's just like old times.

339
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,809
All day, all I could think
about was this moment...

340
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:33,477
wondering if you were going
to show up,

341
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:35,145
whether... if we were going
to sneak off

342
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:36,782
or just, you know, do it right here.

343
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:39,660
What the hell are you doing?

344
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:45,082
How many times do I have
to tell you it's over?

345
00:18:45,248 --> 00:18:47,541
Are you kidding me?

346
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:48,692
I was ready to leave.

347
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,046
You were the one
that asked me to stay.

348
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,297
With your wife, to
celebrate my birthday.

349
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:54,508
This is how we celebrate.

350
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:55,718
This is our place.

351
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,762
With them sleeping upstairs?

352
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,839
What is wrong with you?

353
00:19:01,873 --> 00:19:04,308
It's like you've forgotten
the last year existed.

354
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:07,311

362
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm so happy you changed your mind.

363
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:32,235
I always wanted to be here with you.

364
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:35,925
I just had to keep up
appearances, or so I thought.

365
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,008
I take it you didn't have
trouble getting away?

366
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:38,928
Uh-uh.

367
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,261
Emergency work meeting.

368
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:43,682
Olivia actually showed
up at the restaurant.

369
00:19:43,848 --> 00:19:45,415
You should have seen
the look in her eyes

370
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:46,477
when he left me there

371
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:47,895
all alone.

372
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,720
Wow.

373
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:50,981
So Happy Birthday to you.

374
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:52,890
Happy Birthday to me.

375
00:19:55,092 --> 00:19:56,927
Hurry up and finish your book.

376
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,912
I don't want to be apart
from you another day.

377
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,565
I'm trying; Work is going slow.

378
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:04,368
The muses are not cooperating.

379
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:06,370
Excuse me, I thought I was your muse.

380
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:07,971
You are my muse.

381
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:10,824
Did you bring it with you?

382
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:11,909
I want you to read to me.

383
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:13,460
Uh-uh, it's terrible.

384
00:20:13,494 --> 00:20:15,256
No, it's brilliant.

385
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:17,591
Come on, it's my birthday.

386
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:21,168
All right, I'll read it.

387
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,722
Hey, what's this?

388
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:26,976
Oh, I went

389
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,936
and picked up the mail.
I was hoping it was a present.

390
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,814
There's no return address on it.

391
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,564
I'm not picky.

392
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:35,526
I'll take presents from anyone.

393
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:52,960
Not exactly your style.

394
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,045
Who's it from?

395
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:58,121
An old friend.

396
00:20:58,155 --> 00:21:00,801
We used to pass it
back and forth on our birthdays.

397
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:02,342
Hmm, that sounds sweet.

398
00:21:02,377 --> 00:21:04,378
Why'd you stop?

399
00:21:07,415 --> 00:21:09,435
You really don't want to
talk about this, do you?

400
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,023
I want you to read to me.

401
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:17,274
All right, but it's a first draft,

402
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:19,693
so please just be gentle.

403
00:21:19,727 --> 00:21:20,727
Never.

404
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:23,157
Okay.

405
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:27,317
<i>City burns</i> by Henry Butler.

406
00:21:27,351 --> 00:21:28,370
"The traffic

407
00:21:28,536 --> 00:21:31,040
"in the city was worse
than usual that day.

408
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,417
"The smog rose hot off the grates,

409
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,025
"into the streets.

410
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:38,172
The mist parted
as the door to the taxi opened."

411
00:21:39,847 --> 00:21:42,666
I haven't forgotten.

412
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,928
I'm ashamed.

413
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,869
And you know what?
You should be, too.

414
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,806
I-I don't want to hurt

415
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:49,356
Andrew or Gemma.

416
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,434
You don't give a crap

417
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,686
about Gemma or Andrew.

418
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:56,649
Maybe I didn't, but I do now.

419
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,515
What about me?

420
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:02,154
We were in love, Siobhan.

421
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,781
We had plans.

422
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,606
Somehow, overnight,
that all changed for you,

423
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,494
but where the hell
does that leave me?

424
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,094
I'm sorry.

425
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,248
I really am.

426
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,598
No, I don't want sorry.

427
00:22:16,584 --> 00:22:18,337

Excusez-moi.

00:23:37,957 --> 00:23:39,335
I need to speak with you.

437
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,961
In my office, s'il vous plaît.

438
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,307
Now's not really a good time.

439
00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:45,466
It's important.

440
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,177
Neither of us wants to cause a scene.

441
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,971
But if you wish to

442
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:53,015
extend your stay here,
we must discuss payment

443
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,034
immediately.

444
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:55,369
My office is this way.

445
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,653
Hey, there you are.

446
00:23:56,671 --> 00:23:58,729
If we leave now, we'll
just make the meeting.

447
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,441
I'm sorry to interrupt.

448
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,526
- Is everything okay?
- Very nice to see you again, monsieur Barrett.

449
00:24:04,692 --> 00:24:06,570
I wasn't aware
that you knew Ms. Farrell.

450
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,821
She works for my company.

451
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:11,116
And we are about to
be late for the boss.

452
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:12,201
You know how he gets.

453
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,578
Please give my very best regards.

454
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:15,871
Will do.

455
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,748
Sorry to delay you.

456
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,062
Just please come see me
at your earliest convenience.

457
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:26,882
Thank you.

458
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,286
What's going on with you?

459
00:24:31,956 --> 00:24:33,857
Just having a lousy week.

460
00:24:37,016 --> 00:24:40,330
I've always dreamed
of coming to Paris.

461
00:24:40,364 --> 00:24:43,000
I'd taken lessons for years.

462
00:24:43,034 --> 00:24:45,836
This is my first trip.

463
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:48,695
My husband kept
promising to bring me.

464
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:51,141
When I left him,

465
00:24:51,175 --> 00:24:53,951
I decided to come on my own.

466
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,162
Does he know you're here?

467
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:03,236
Guess you could say I ran away.

468
00:25:05,106 --> 00:25:06,239
I had a plan.

469
00:25:06,274 --> 00:25:08,090
I had money to live on.

470
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:11,093
But it's all just falling apart.

471
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,831
Somebody drained my savings account.

472
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:16,557
Can't afford my hotel.

473
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:20,060
And I can't ask anyone
back home for help,

474
00:25:20,226 --> 00:25:23,981
because then he would know
I was here.

475
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,209
You think your husband
took your money?

476
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,747
I don't know.

477
00:25:30,765 --> 00:25:32,415
I can't even really think about it.

478
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:35,909
I just know I'm not ready to go back.

479
00:25:36,075 --> 00:25:39,204
And the most pathetic part of all:

480
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,892
Today is my birthday.

481
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,196
Wait.

482
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,647
Let me get this straight.

483
00:25:47,699 --> 00:25:52,469
So you always wanted to come
to Paris, and now you're here,

484
00:25:52,503 --> 00:25:55,637
on your birthday, miserable?

485
00:25:55,803 --> 00:25:58,475
Pretty pathetic, huh?

486
00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:01,795
Well, that is, at is not acceptable.

487
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:02,796
Come on.

488
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,479
We're going to go celebrate.

489
00:26:04,645 --> 00:26:06,190
What about the brunette?

490
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,952
She's fun, but, uh...

491
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,777
I've always had a thing blondes.

492
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,947
<i>Agent Machado.</i>

493
00:26:14,113 --> 00:26:15,657
Found a citation
from the local marina.

494
00:26:15,823 --> 00:26:18,595
Somebody took the Martins'
boat out September 9,

495
00:26:18,629 --> 00:26:20,514
and then returned it
to the wrong slip.

496
00:26:20,565 --> 00:26:23,040
What's this have to do
with Bridget Kelly?

497
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,017
The timing fits.

498
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:25,417
We know Bridget was here that day.

499
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,821
I followed up by interviewing
everybody at the marina.

500
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:29,322
Nobody saw Siobhan or Bridget.

501
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:30,923
So then I checked local water cams,

502
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,643
radio traffic, coast guard
activity for that day.

503
00:26:33,661 --> 00:26:35,677
That's when things got interesting.

504
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,932
Figured you'd want
to hear this for yourself.

505
00:26:43,171 --> 00:26:44,937
Distress call, U.S. coast...

506
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,163
To Siobhan.

507
00:26:53,181 --> 00:26:54,664
Happy Birthday, darling.

508
00:26:54,682 --> 00:26:56,683
Thank you.

509
00:26:58,335 --> 00:26:59,553
Sparkling cider.

510
00:26:59,604 --> 00:27:00,637
Really?

511
00:27:00,671 --> 00:27:01,838
Well, it is Siobhan's birthday,

512
00:27:01,856 --> 00:27:03,339
and if she can't drink,
it hardly seems fair

513
00:27:03,357 --> 00:27:04,498
for the rest of us to indulge.

514
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,793
Since when is life fair?

515
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,314
I can't believe all these presents.

516
00:27:11,348 --> 00:27:13,048
It's too much.

517
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,841
You can never get enough presents.

518
00:27:15,007 --> 00:27:17,487
And the personal chef?

519
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:18,845
I don't deserve all this.

520
00:27:19,011 --> 00:27:21,524
We're just getting started.

521
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:23,016
You are happy with Giancarlo?

522
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:24,911
'Cause the last time
we were at Del Cavalieri,

523
00:27:24,962 --> 00:27:26,395
you thought the branzino
was overcooked.

524
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,166
Oh, it's great.

525
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,500
I'm sure it's delicious.

526
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:31,483
Mmm.

527
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,568
Did you just eat meat?

528
00:27:33,734 --> 00:27:35,237
Mm-hmm.

529
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,873
But you haven't touched meat for...

530
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:37,906
Three years.

531
00:27:40,895 --> 00:27:42,494
I guess I just,

532
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,663
I've been really craving it

533
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,833
since I'm pregnant, and thought
today was as good a day as any.

534
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:56,758
Happy Birthday.

535
00:28:02,805 --> 00:28:04,600
<i>But it's our birthday.</i>

536
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,477
<i>We can always</i> <i>buy one and share.</i>

537
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:09,438
Like, forever?

538
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,898
Hey, Siobhan.

539
00:28:12,064 --> 00:28:13,650
You okay?

540
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:15,629
Yeah.

541
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,597
Yeah, I'm sure it's just the food.

542
00:28:17,632 --> 00:28:19,364
Um, excuse me for one second.

543
00:28:31,312 --> 00:28:32,612
<i>"Dear Bridget,</i>

544
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:34,698
<i>"thanks for sending back</i>
<i>the necklace.</i>

545
00:28:34,732 --> 00:28:39,384
<i>"Seeing it made me realize</i>
<i>how much I've missed you.</i>

546
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,556
<i>"I know it's not our birthday,</i>
<i>but I wanted to return it.</i>

547
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,709
<i>I hope you'll wear it</i>
<i>when you come visit me."</i>

548
00:29:07,932 --> 00:29:09,933
Happy Birthday, sis.

549
00:29:12,236 --> 00:29:14,637
You're wearing it.

550
00:29:14,655 --> 00:29:16,088
What?

551
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,964
The necklace.

552
00:29:19,994 --> 00:29:21,795
I told you about this?

553
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:23,011
You don't remember?

554
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:27,140
You were, uh, pretty upset.

555
00:29:29,003 --> 00:29:32,672
I guess... it's hard...

556
00:29:32,707 --> 00:29:34,147
Thinking about her.

557
00:29:34,313 --> 00:29:35,942
Your old friend.

558
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:37,859
You didn't, you didn't
tell me her name,

559
00:29:38,025 --> 00:29:39,746
and you wouldn't put the necklace on,

560
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,571
but you couldn't stop staring at it.

561
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:45,200
Does this mean that you guys made up?

562
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:52,207
Wait. Last night, I was,
I was drunk and angry,

563
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,668
and I had no right
to talk to you that way.

564
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,462
No, you didn't.

565
00:29:57,628 --> 00:30:00,800
Listen, I have watched you
with Andrew for years.

566
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:04,304
And you are so good at pretending,

567
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:06,556
that no one would ever guess
there is nothing there,

568
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,473
unlike, unlike me and Gemma.

569
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:09,642
Henry, don't do this.

570
00:30:09,677 --> 00:30:10,976
But when you were with me,

571
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,431
it was like something else.

572
00:30:14,465 --> 00:30:18,151
And you had this look, like...

573
00:30:18,185 --> 00:30:20,944
Like I was the only person in
the world that mattered to you.

574
00:30:21,188 --> 00:30:24,531
I lived for that look.

575
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:28,328
Tonight...

576
00:30:28,362 --> 00:30:31,581
With Andrew...

577
00:30:31,615 --> 00:30:33,415
You were looking at him that way.

578
00:30:35,586 --> 00:30:37,169
I don't know what to say.

579
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:41,207
I just don't understand it, shiv.

580
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:43,676
But I do love you.

581
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:44,885
And if walking away

582
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:48,054
is what you want to be happy, then...

583
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,183
It's gonna kill me, but I'll do it.

584
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,394
It's what I want.

585
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,556
Okay.

586
00:30:59,393 --> 00:31:00,810
That's not everything though.

587
00:31:00,844 --> 00:31:04,362
You, um, you're pregnant.

588
00:31:04,528 --> 00:31:05,681
And we both know...

589
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:06,865
We don't know.

590
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,785
That baby is ours.

591
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,573
Henry, can you just trust me?

592
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:16,082
Have the patience to know
that we'll figure this out?

593
00:31:18,245 --> 00:31:19,746
Please?

594
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:44,809
Coming?

595
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:48,496
Hey.

596
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,998
Come on.

597
00:31:50,032 --> 00:31:50,999
You okay?

598
00:31:51,325 --> 00:31:53,034
Fine.

599
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,800
So, did I finally
get a birthday right?

600
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,383
It's stunning.

601
00:32:08,434 --> 00:32:10,887

already speaking French?

Uh, one word a night.

00:34:08,704 --> 00:34:10,321
Thank God.

642
00:34:10,356 --> 00:34:13,258
Maybe we should double up
on the lessons.

Unfortunately, I have to go to work.

646
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:23,937
But first...

647
00:34:27,306 --> 00:34:28,733
We never had cake last night,

648
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:31,736
and, we are in Paris, so...

649
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:34,447
Thank you. I love it.

650
00:34:39,618 --> 00:34:43,498
Oh, uh, I ran into the manager
while I was downstairs.

651
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,540
I actually know him pretty well.

652
00:34:45,591 --> 00:34:47,752
My company does a lot
of overseas business.

653
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,827
Clients travel here from all over,

654
00:34:49,845 --> 00:34:52,006
so we have an account with the hotel.

655
00:34:52,172 --> 00:34:54,592
It seems that he was
unaware that we have

656
00:34:54,758 --> 00:34:56,351
a very valued client in town now...

657
00:34:56,385 --> 00:35:01,725
Cora Farrell... who will be
staying here indefinitely.

658
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,602
Tyler, you can't do that. You
could get in serious trouble.

659
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:07,145
We have clients in and out
of town constantly.

660
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:09,190
No one even blinks at the charges.

661
00:35:09,356 --> 00:35:12,617
I can't believe you did that for me.

662
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:15,572
You have no idea what it means to me.

663
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:19,659
It means that you can go
out with me again tonight.

664
00:35:24,246 --> 00:35:28,042
Mmm. Have you seen
my tie, by any chance?

665
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:30,535
Um, check the bathroom.

666
00:35:30,553 --> 00:35:32,088
Will do.

667
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:00,448
Ah...
For you.

668
00:36:00,499 --> 00:36:01,451
Thank you.

669
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,117
I will pick you up at 7:00.

670
00:36:03,169 --> 00:36:05,170
Okay.

671
00:36:24,306 --> 00:36:26,184
The plan is back on.

672
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:31,980
Tyler Barrett just extended my
hotel stay, on the company dime.

673
00:36:32,031 --> 00:36:34,609
This is gonna be easier
than we thought.

674
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,701
Gemma?

675
00:36:38,621 --> 00:36:40,622
Gemma!

676
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:45,960
Gemma?

677
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:50,448
Please pick up your phone
or call me back, just...

678
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:53,218
Let me know you're okay.
I'm worried about you.

679
00:36:59,925 --> 00:37:02,143
You really shouldn't leave your door open.

680
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,498
You can't be here.
This is private property.

681
00:37:07,533 --> 00:37:08,852
This is a courtesy visit.

682
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,271
One last chance for
you to come clean.

683
00:37:13,188 --> 00:37:15,106
I know you're lying to me.

684
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,944
Bridget was in the
Hamptons, with you.

685
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,904
This has to stop.

686
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,280
No more talking to my friends, my...

687
00:37:22,314 --> 00:37:24,701
Hello? Hello? It's my sister!

688
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:25,910
Can anyone hear me?

689
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:31,875
Hello? It's my sister!
Can anyone hear me?

690
00:37:33,592 --> 00:37:36,171
I bet you didn't know
the, uh, the coast guard

691
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,298
records all the distress calls
that it receives.

692
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,131
They have a dedicated channel.

693
00:37:40,165 --> 00:37:41,509
Most radios are tuned to it

694
00:37:41,675 --> 00:37:45,219
by default, so chances are,
you pick up your boat radio,

695
00:37:45,271 --> 00:37:46,556
you're talking to the coast guard.

696
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,308
I don't know what
you're talking about.

697
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,691
Cut the crap.

698
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:53,311
You were with your
sister on the boat.

699
00:37:53,345 --> 00:37:55,982
Something happened that
made you make this call.

700
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,116
What happened?

701
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,703
Okay, you're right.

702
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,789
I was with my sister that day.

703
00:38:04,823 --> 00:38:05,950
She showed up. I...

704
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:07,327
Because you invited her.

705
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,829
We found her duffel bag.

706
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:14,799
It was nice, at first.

707
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:17,552
We connected.

708
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,340
And then, Bridget told me
what she was mixed up in.

709
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,840
She was just trying to fix things.

710
00:38:22,874 --> 00:38:25,803
I-I understand that now,
but at the time, I...

711
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:28,396
I was shocked, and...

712
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,432
We fought. I...

713
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:35,396
I was afraid that she might hurt me.

714
00:38:35,562 --> 00:38:37,941
That's why I made the call.
I told her that was it.

715
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,326
I-I never wanted to see her again.

716
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,071
That was the last time I saw her.

717
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,907
How'd you know where to find
Bridget's duffel bag?

718
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:49,035
I found the key, after she had gone.

719
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,329
I thought it might be hers.

720
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,622
I went to get the bag to look,
to see if there was anything

721
00:38:54,673 --> 00:38:57,008
that might lead me to where she was.

722
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:58,426
I'm just trying to do

723
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,296
the same thing that you are,
Agent Machado.

724
00:39:00,462 --> 00:39:02,130
I'm just trying to keep Bridget safe.

725
00:39:02,181 --> 00:39:04,015
Why'd you withdraw all
that money last week?

726
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:05,343
Because I needed it.

727
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,304
There's no law against spending
your own money, is there?

728
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,356
I don't know what you
want from me, Agent Machado.

729
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,192
I'm only trying to protect my sister.

730
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:17,729
You can search my house,
my apartments if you want.

731
00:39:17,763 --> 00:39:20,865
You can follow me around
for the rest of my life,

732
00:39:20,899 --> 00:39:24,237
but I promise you,
you won't find Bridget.

733
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:28,950
I think you know the way out.

734
00:39:51,647 --> 00:39:54,350
Bridget's sponsor.

735
00:39:54,516 --> 00:39:56,853
You never stop lying, do you?

736
00:40:03,817 --> 00:40:06,863
Gemma, I've been looking
all over for you.

737
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,949
That's for sleeping with
my husband, you whore.

738
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:18,041
How could you? I thought you
were my friend, my best friend.

739
00:40:18,594 --> 00:40:20,655
I opened up to you about
everything. God, you were

740
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,430
the one trying to convince me
Henry wasn't having an affair.

741
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:24,589
I'm so stupid!

742
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,800
- It's not what you think.
- I heard you, Siobhan. You and Henry.

743
00:40:27,966 --> 00:40:29,825
How much he loves you.

744
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:32,347
How you're pregnant with his baby.

745
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:36,164
I'm so sorry that you heard
that, okay? I feel horrible...

746
00:40:36,198 --> 00:40:37,810
Oh, I'm sorry.
You feel horrible?

747
00:40:37,976 --> 00:40:39,885
I'm sorry, I don't
want you to feel bad.

748
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:43,004
Why don't you sleep with my husband
and see if that makes you feel better?

749
00:40:43,038 --> 00:40:44,723
I didn't mean it like that, okay?

750
00:40:44,757 --> 00:40:46,527
It's just, it's more
complicated than you know...

751
00:40:46,693 --> 00:40:48,677
Hell yeah, it is.

752
00:40:48,711 --> 00:40:50,865
Think of what this is
gonna do to Andrew.

753
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,201
Though I am going to enjoy the look

754
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,883
on your face when I tell him.

755
00:40:54,901 --> 00:40:56,954
I hope you look exactly the way
I do now.

756
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,750
- Please don't do this. You don't understand.
- Get out of my way, you bitch.

757
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,858
Please, just look at me.
What, Siobhan? What?

758
00:41:02,892 --> 00:41:05,171
Because there is nothing
you could possibly say

759
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,632
to me to make this okay.
I'm not who you think I am.

760
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:11,700
I'm not Siobhan.

761
00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:14,972
I'm Bridget.

762
