1
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,120
TSOTSI

2
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,120
Roll again...
Roll again...

3
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,800
- Eleven!
- Eleven?

4
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,120
Nine.

5
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,880
- What?
- 4 and 5 is 9, not 11.

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,080
It's good! It's good.
4 and 5 is 9, not 11!

7
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,800
Throw again, brother.

8
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,800
- That's enough.
- Hey Tsotsi, what we're doing tonight?

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,400
Yeah, what we doing?

10
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,960
The little gangster!

11
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,720
Did you learn to drive?

12
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,760
I was sick. So what?

13
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,080
- Come sit teacher boy.
- Fuck off I'm not your teacher boy.

14
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,240
You know you went too far tonight.

15
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,680
What's your name, Tsotsi?

16
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,360
Your real name. Thug,
Tsotsi, it's not a name.

17
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,200
- Boston, don't ask him questions.
- Why not?

18
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,160
I'm six months with you.
I want to know his name.

19
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,160
Everyone has a name.
A real one. From his mother.

20
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,560
- Hey, Soekie, we're dry here.
- I'll come when I'm ready, okay?

21
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,480
Decency Tsotsi? Do you
know that word? Decency.

22
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,480
I had a bit of it,
that's why I got sick.

23
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,840
And that fat man with the tie,
he had a lot. And now?

24
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,440
He's dead.

25
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,640
Jesus, Butcher go get it yourself.
I'm trying to talk seriously here.

26
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,360
Come sit, sonny.

27
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,000
Just remember... I don't
want any trouble in here.

28
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,000
What's wrong?
Are you sick again?

29
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,880
Jesus!

30
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,280
Tonight Tsotsi...

31
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,360
When we killed the fat man...

32
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,680
I felt like this inside me...

33
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,160
Do you ever feel like that?

34
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,840
For a woman Tsotsi?
Maybe you had a woman.

35
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,320
And when she left you... It hurt...

36
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,600
And you bled...

37
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,800
Your father... Your father, Tsotsi...
Where's your father?

38
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,160
Where's your father
and your mother...

39
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,160
Jesus, Tsotsi!

40
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,080
Tell that bastard never
to come here again.

41
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,600
John! John!
Open the gate!

42
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,800
The remote isn't working.
Open the gate!

43
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,560
Stop!

44
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,960
Yes, that's the registration...

45
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,480
Just tell them the car
is empty. No baby.

46
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,240
Jesus, you stink!

47
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,120
Quiet, baby.

48
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,240
Quiet!

49
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,480
- Yes what?
- It's us.

50
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,000
- Who?
- Aap and Butcher.

51
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,040
- We need to talk.
- About what?

52
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,080
About Boston.

53
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,160
- Where is he?
- At Soekie's.

54
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,160
- He won't work with us anymore.
- Says who? You or him?

55
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,200
What's that?
That smell.

56
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,520
- It's me.
- What's wrong?

57
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,360
I'm sick.

58
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,600
- You need a doctor.
- I'm fine.

59
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,840
Hey sister! Feed him.
Come feed him here.

60
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,120
If you got no milk,
let him suck me.

61
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,040
- What are we doing tonight Tsotsi?
- Let's meet later at Park Station.

62
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,640
Later's good.
Meet you later then.

63
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,920
Hey man! Did you smell?
Stinks like shit!

64
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,560
Were there any fingerprints?

65
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,640
This bastard is a nodody.

66
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,840
He went at the township you said.

67
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:21,600
- Sir, we can't even track stolen cars...
- Don't tell me what you can't do!

68
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,320
I want you to find my child.

69
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,440
When my wife wakes up, I want my
child right next to her. Am I clear?

70
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,320
Where is Tsotsi?

71
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,360
- Fuck him.
- Yeah, fuck him.

72
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,520
Hey, watch where
the fuck you're going!

73
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,000
Dog!

74
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,000
Now what? You want
me to say sorry?

75
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,240
Watch where you
put your feet. Move!

76
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,440
Hey what's up Bheki!

77
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,040
- Who won?
- Irish fancy, brother. 7 to 2.

78
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,400
- Cripple donkey!
- Did you win anything?

79
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,080
- Win? Fuck all!
- Put a 100 at red bullet tomorrow.

80
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,920
Red bullet got no legs.
Silver lightning!

81
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,440
Don't take too much!

82
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,040
Where is this guy?

83
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,400
Where did you get
your driver's licence?

84
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,080
Did your mother
teach you to drive?

85
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,000
What do you want, boy?

86
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,240
Do you want my money?

87
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,640
- Stand up.
- What?

88
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,200
- Get up and walk.
- Who are you, Jesus Christ?

89
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,960
- I'm a cripple!
- You lie. Stand up.

90
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,800
Go to hell.

91
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,760
Fine. Here's all
the money I have.

92
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,480
What you want from me? Take
the money and leave me alone.

93
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,800
Fuck man! Fuck you!

94
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,680
You fucking bastard!

95
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,240
Are you happy now?

96
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,600
You made an old man
piss in his pants.

97
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,720
Why are you following me? Why?

98
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,960
I saw a dog once...

99
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Two kicks... And it's
back was broken.

100
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,640
It crawled...
Just like you...

101
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,600
What kind of a man kicks a dog?

102
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,520
What happened to your legs?

103
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,840
I was working at the mines.
Digging gold.

104
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,240
A beam fell on me.
It broke me.

105
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,200
Why do you go on...
when you live like a dog?

106
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,080
I like to feel the sun on the street.

107
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,200
Even with these hands...
I can still feel the heat.

108
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,240
Pick up your money.

109
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,840
Enjoy your tea.

110
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,640
What do you want?

111
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,440
Leave it down!
Leave it down, damn it!

112
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,160
Sit...Sit...Sit!

113
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,560
- Please don't hurt my baby.
- I won't. Put him down.

114
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,920
- In the bag...
- What?

115
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,200
Look in the bag.

116
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,360
Hey, look in the bag!

117
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,440
Feed him.

118
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,520
I'm not leaving if you don't
feed him... Feed him!

119
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,600
Did you make this?

120
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,080
Yeah.

121
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,880
Why is it rusted?

122
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,800
I was sad.

123
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,200
And this?

124
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,960
- Were you happy?
- Yes.

125
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,920
Better?

126
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,240
Now you got something, right?
Can you do anything?

127
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,880
Yes, this will help.

128
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,680
Find him... and tell him...

129
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,240
If he has hurt my baby in any way...

130
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,080
I will kill him with my own hands.

131
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,840
He's done.

132
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,560
Put him back.

133
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,320
Where is his mother?

134
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,200
He's mine.

135
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,440
Put him back.

136
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,600
Can I wash him first?

137
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,800
There you go little guy...

138
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,760
Do you want me to wash you?
You do, don't you?

139
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,720
If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.

140
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
Come on brother!

141
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,200
- Seven!
- Three and five is eight you moron.

142
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,800
Eight is close!
Lend me 50 Fela.

143
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,720
50 bucks...
I can feel your pain.

144
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,160
You're rich...
What's 50 bucks to you?

145
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,720
50 to me? With 50 bucks I buy beers
for you losers at the end of the day.

146
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,760
- Win then.
- Fuck you.

147
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,600
Who does this look like?

148
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,160
Tsotsi, right?

149
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,720
- What does it say?
- Says he shot a woman...

150
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:56,120
...stole her car with her child inside
...what kind of a man is he?

151
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,960
No, it's not Tsotsi.

152
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,920
It's not Tsotsi.
He can't drive.

153
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,160
Fela, remember you
tried to teach him?

154
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,840
He drove your 320 right onto a bus,
in front of the police station...

155
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,760
- Remember? It's not Tsotsi.
- Yes I remember! Don't be angry Soekie.

156
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,320
You know what?
You should all be working for me.

157
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,680
Cut the crap.
You too teacher boy.

158
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,840
Or are you gonna take the beating
and go crawling back like a woman?

159
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,200
Tsotsi didn't go to school.
He doesn't know of decency.

160
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,200
What about you Fela?
Do you know decency?

161
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,840
Hey man, don't start with
your fucking big words.

162
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,720
You can't even spell
the word, can you?

163
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,080
Decency... Let's see...
D-E-C-E-N-C-Y.

164
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,240
- How's that?
- What does it mean?

165
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,640
Decency means making a
fucking decent living sonny.

166
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,520
Respect man...
For yourself...

167
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,160
It got fuck all to do
with your way of living.

168
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,240
Do you want respect?
I'll give you respect...

169
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,840
When you quit drinking
and get a driver's licence.

170
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,160
I need drivers not drinkers.

171
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,400
Fuck your decency.

172
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,760
Yeah, fuck my decency.

173
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,800
Fuck you man.

174
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:42,000
Anytime, you'll need help... just ask.

175
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,320
Quick and silent.

176
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,360
The old way.

177
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,240
Play.

178
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,880
David... come here.

179
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Hold my hand.

180
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,640
Don't be afraid.

181
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,120
Don't be afraid.

182
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,680
What are you doing?

183
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:33,400
- I want him near me, Mandla.
- Son, go outside... Now!

184
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,440
- Mandla, please.
- You know you are sick.

185
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,000
What if he gets sick like you?

186
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,800
It's all right, my baby.
It's all right...

187
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,520
You... stay away
from your mother.

188
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,960
Get out I said!
Out damn it!

189
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,920
Out you fucking dog!

190
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,040
Leave it.

191
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,440
Son...

192
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,200
don't look at me like that.

193
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,680
Hey Tsotsi!

194
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,280
- Who's there?
- Aap. Open the door.

195
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,040
- What do you want?
- I've just come...

196
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,760
- For what?
- I always come around.

197
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,120
- Where's Butcher?
- He won't come.

198
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,480
He's angry. He says you
did a job on your own.

199
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:52,040
- Maybe I did. So what?
- That's what I told him.

200
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,880
But then he said
''Let's go and join Fela''.

201
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,520
Then what are you doing here?

202
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,920
Years man...
You and me together.

203
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,120
The two of us...
Since we were kids.

204
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,480
And all these years you've
just been following me.

205
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,560
''Hey Tsotsi what are we doing tonight?
Hey, it's good, it's good''.

206
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,240
Fuck, why can't you
decide things for yourself?

207
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:34,080
All right, fine...
We can start again.

208
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,240
Like when Vusi and Peter
were shot. It felt like this.

209
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:45,920
But we started again.
We found Boston and Butcher.

210
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,520
- What?
- Yeah, what?

211
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,960
You know what brother?
This time it's finished.

212
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:08,600
Finished and done. Go join Fela's gang.
I can't help you anymore.

213
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,160
I'm sorry.

214
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,800
Tsotsi...

215
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:32,280
What? You wanna return
to your big fancy house?

216
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,520
You want to go back home?

217
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,080
I'll show you a home.

218
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,440
What do you want?

219
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,280
What's in the bag?

220
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,720
Let me see.

221
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:16,760
- What are you doing with it?
- Why, you want it? Here.

222
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,200
Fuck off man, we can't feed him.

223
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,600
Did his mother die?

224
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,200
Do you see that pipe?
Top row, left.

225
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,200
It's theirs.

226
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,200
Used to be mine.

227
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,480
Where do you live now?

228
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:08,120
- I got my own place.
- Why did you bring the baby here?

229
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:12,560
He wants to show him his old house.

230
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,040
Where have you been?

231
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:48,040
Quiet baby, quiet.
Hurry, please!

232
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,600
Feed him.

233
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,880
Drink, baby.

234
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,720
Drink you hear me?
Drink so you can grow up.

235
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,880
What's your name little one?

236
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,520
How should I call you?

237
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,120
David.

238
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:04,880
- His name is David.
- David. Now you're drinking.

239
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,360
Are you his father?

240
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,480
What happened to his mother?

241
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,400
Is she dead?

242
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,320
Where is the father of your baby?

243
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,040
Last winter, he went
to work one day...

244
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,560
and never came back...

245
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,360
It was dark... after 5.

246
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,320
It's a long way home
from the factory.

247
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,040
You can't always see
who's walking behind you.

248
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,720
What was his name?

249
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,480
Zacharia.

250
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,840
How do you get money?

251
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:35,000
- Do you sew?
- Yes I sew... and I mend clothes.

252
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,480
And these?

253
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,000
Can you sell these?

254
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,880
I've sold some... Not many.

255
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:57,920
- How much for this one?
- Fifty.

256
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,680
- Fifty? For broken glass?
- You only see broken glass...

257
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,800
- What do you see?
- Colour. Light. On you.

258
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,920
Give him to me.

259
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,960
Give me the baby.
I'll take care of him.

260
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,920
You can see him anytime.

261
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,840
My Jabu and David will play together.

262
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,480
I know about babies.
I'll look after him.

263
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,840
Give him to me.

264
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,800
I'll be back at the morning.
He better be here.

265
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:00,440
- Where are you going?
- To get money. So I can pay you.

266
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,120
- I don't want your money.
- Yes you do.

267
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,720
No, I don't.

268
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,800
Don't forget. He's mine.

269
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,720
Stand still. You must keep it clean.

270
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:43,680
- You never had a child, did you?
- Don't be rude. I'm helping you!

271
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,440
You are clever Boston.
You should go back to school.

272
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,520
- School costs money.
- We should go work with Fela.

273
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:57,320
- We'll make plenty of money.
- He can work here with me.

274
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,640
- He'll drink all your profit sister.
- Leave him alone, please!

275
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,560
Get out of here!

276
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,760
I don't want you here!

277
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,040
He can come stay with me.

278
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,440
What? You think he
wants to be with you?

279
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,600
Look at his face...
Look what you've done to him.

280
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:35,520
And now its infected!
Say what you want and leave.

281
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,400
I remember when he first came here,
to the Shacks. He had a lot of money.

282
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,280
- You gave him as much beer as he wanted.
- He came to forget.

283
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:54,200
Yes, and when he fell down in the street,
sick from the beer you sold him...

284
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,160
I found him, not you.

285
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,880
Brother...

286
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:07,680
Who took care of you, when you
were lying there in the street?

287
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,320
Who cleaned you up, when you
couldn't even remember your name?

288
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,600
Who picked you up then brother?
Me or her?

289
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,880
Help him come to my house.

290
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,840
Why did you bring me here?

291
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,400
You're a teacher right?

292
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,880
I was never a teacher...

293
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,640
I didn't give the exams.

294
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,600
Don't laugh!

295
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,920
You still can.

296
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:11,440
- I can't go back.
- You need money... We'll help.

297
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:17,560
We'll get the money and
you'll take the exams.

298
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,640
See?

299
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,840
We need a job.

300
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,680
- Where are we going?
- We're going. It's good.

301
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,560
- Why are we here?
- Stop asking him questions.

302
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,440
Why this house?

303
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:01,560
- Leave it. We're working together, right?
- Why are we sitting here?

304
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,200
We're sitting... It's good.

305
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,600
- Turn off the alarm.
- It's over there.

306
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,680
Don't make a mistake.

307
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,320
- Who else is here?
- No one.

308
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,560
Move!

309
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:21,880
Sit.

310
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,600
Where is your wife?

311
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,400
In hospital.

312
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,360
She was shot three days ago.

313
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,800
Please guys... Take everything,
but my wife needs me.

314
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,680
Our child is missing.

315
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,160
- Let me kill this guy now.
- No! Later...

316
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,080
- Why later?
- We might need him.

317
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,720
What for?

318
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,600
Do you have a safe in here?

319
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,880
- No safe.
- We'll see...

320
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,560
- He saw our faces.
- I said later. Do what I say.

321
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,320
Are you okay?

322
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,320
Hey, what's going on with you?

323
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,600
Hey buddy...They say every
wine tastes different...Is it true?

324
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,200
Sure...You get used to the taste.

325
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,920
I prefer beer. Zamalek.

326
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:08,600
Hey buddy... I'm hungry.
Do you want anything?

327
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,480
Sure.

328
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,760
Hey buddy, what you have?
Cheese, cold meat, sausages...

329
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,160
- Chicken livers?
- Sure. In the fridge.

330
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,760
What are you doing? They
haven't finished. Are you stupid?

331
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,960
- Hey man, look what you've done!
- It wasn't me man! Look in his hands.

332
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,880
- What were you doing?
- I didn't see him.

333
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,440
What are you doing?
You can't drive.

334
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,880
- Open the gate!
- Get in!

335
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,080
- What have you done?
- He was a trash!

336
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:32,360
- He's dead, he's dead!
- Yes he is! He always wanted to kill!

337
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,920
You never stopped him before!

338
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:17,040
Okay, let's do it. Buddy, if you
learned to drive, I'd give you more.

339
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:21,400
Move!

340
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,440
Let's go.

341
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,160
Come on, brother.

342
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,680
You want to stay with Fela?

343
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,480
When is my turn?

344
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,640
- For what?
- You hit Boston, really hard.

345
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,080
Now Butcher...

346
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,360
When is my turn?

347
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,680
You're right. We are finished.

348
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:12,000
It's over. Like Butcher.
Finished and done.

349
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,240
- Who is it?
- It's me.

350
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,200
What happened?

351
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,240
Can I come in?

352
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,800
Please?

353
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,520
Thank you.

354
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:19,960
It's for you.

355
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,800
- I don't want them.
- I won on the dice.

356
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,000
I don't want them.

357
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,240
I know where you got him...

358
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,680
I saw the newspaper.

359
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,760
They say his mother
may never walk again.

360
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,520
You can't give her legs back.

361
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,960
But you must give her son back.

362
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,800
- What is this?
- Milk.

363
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:21,520
- For mothers without milk.
- You put it in here right?

364
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,920
But it won't make
you his mother.

365
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,760
Please, give him to me.

366
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,760
I'll take him back for you.

367
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:08,280
If I take him back...
can I still come here?

368
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,920
I'm sorry, my brother.

369
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:26,840
Yes, I told you, Western Section.
Just after the cap.

370
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:29,720
I see you.

371
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,920
- Where is he?
- That shack, with the small window.

372
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,200
Watch the car.

373
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,480
- Where's the baby?
- What baby?

374
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,440
- Get the gun.
- Speak, fast!

375
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,800
- I don't know anything.
- Don't bullshit us.

376
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:57,280
- No.. no.. stop! It's not him!
- What are you saying ma'am?

377
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:01,160
- Talk Boston! Where did he go?
- I don't know!

378
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,240
Take it easy Zuma.

379
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:11,080
- Tell me the truth, I'm not stupid.
- I'm not lying. It's true man!

380
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:08,160
You! What do you want?

381
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,160
Take it.

382
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:10,800
- If you need anything, help yourself.
- Thank you, I'm fine.

383
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,560
Thanks.

384
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:06,640
A child was stolen by someone who lives
on this street and nobody's seen anything?

385
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,440
Yeah?

386
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:10,800
- Pumla, eat please.
- I can't, John.

387
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:25,400
Hello?

388
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:32,640
I'll leave it here.

389
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,600
Who is this?

390
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,160
Your baby. I'll leave it here.

391
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:45,000
Don't do anything stupid guys.
We're coming.

392
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,600
- Please sir, wait!
- Out of my way!

393
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,240
Put the child down
and step away!

394
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:11,560
Please, stay in sir!

395
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:21,200
Please, I beg you...
Just stay where you are.

396
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:31,040
- Put the child down!
- Hey, please, take it easy...

397
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,360
He's holding my child.

398
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:38,600
John, what's happening?

399
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,200
Pumla, go inside.

400
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:45,800
Stay back ma'am!
Steyn, pull her back.

401
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,560
Don't you touch me.

402
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,280
Boy... bring me my child.

403
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:09,840
Bring my child to me!

404
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:23,000
- Hey. Put the child down and step back!
- Quiet man. Let us deal with it please.

405
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:28,360
Let me handle it.

406
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:32,320
Tell your men to lower their weapons.
He's going nowhere.

407
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:37,400
All right everybody...
Don't do anything stupid. Relax.

408
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,760
You too. Lower your weapon please.

409
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,480
Brother...

410
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,320
We don't want you to get hurt...

411
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:10,000
I promise... Nobody's gonna hurt you.

412
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,680
I'm opening the gate now.

413
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,200
You stay there.
I'll come to you.

414
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:26,880
I'm opening it now.
Okay? All right?

415
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:28,800
I'm opening.

416
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,160
I'm coming now.
