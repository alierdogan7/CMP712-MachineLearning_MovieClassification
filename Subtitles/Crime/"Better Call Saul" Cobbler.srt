1
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:10,190
- Howard.
- Morning!

2
00:02:10,191 --> 00:02:11,657
Delivery for McGill.

3
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:13,025
What're you doing here?

4
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,226
Ah, it's been a while.

5
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:15,341
Thought I should come in and check on you.

6
00:02:15,663 --> 00:02:17,029
Did I hear music?

7
00:02:17,064 --> 00:02:18,264
- Hmm?
- No, no.

8
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:22,468
I was just... ‭let me get that for you.

9
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:30,042
- Good to see you, Howard.
- Oh, likewise.

10
00:02:30,077 --> 00:02:32,511
You are sorely missed, my friend.

11
00:02:32,546 --> 00:02:34,847
Don't take that as any undo pressure.

12
00:02:34,882 --> 00:02:38,484
Um, I'm thinking of maybe coming in

13
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:40,552
for an hour or two next week.

14
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:42,554
Maybe kind of play it by ear.

15
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,124
Well, ‭I-if you feel comfortable.

16
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,914
I mean, we certainly
would love to have you.

17
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:50,684
We will take anything we can get.

18
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,621
I'll figure out a day and get
Ernesto to give you a heads up.

19
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,649
That sounds great.

20
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,354
How's Ernie working out?

21
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,090
Uh, he's been fine, for the most part.

22
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,425
Excellent.

23
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,194
Everything on track with, uh, Sandpiper?

24
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,128
Moving along.

25
00:03:11,914 --> 00:03:16,069
Davis & Main are, uh...
really pulling their weight.

26
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:17,704
Well, they better.

27
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,668
It's a complex case.

28
00:03:20,442 --> 00:03:24,577
Well, it's definitely not
a two-man job, that's for sure.

29
00:03:24,613 --> 00:03:26,880
Anyone, uh, heard from Jimmy?

30
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,183
I have, yes. I've talked to him.

31
00:03:30,218 --> 00:03:31,751
How is he?

32
00:03:31,786 --> 00:03:33,586
He's fine.

33
00:03:33,622 --> 00:03:37,090
Doing well.

34
00:03:38,393 --> 00:03:43,129
Speaking of which... I have some news.

35
00:03:43,164 --> 00:03:45,798
He's working at Davis & Main.

36
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:49,682
Doing what?

37
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,607
Oh, working as an attorney.

38
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:58,144
Hm.

39
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:02,048
Clifford Main hired Jimmy?

40
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,171
Mm-hmm.

41
00:04:04,753 --> 00:04:09,122
To be fair, he had his doubts,
but he's giving Jimmy a chance.

42
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:11,591
He had his own people
doing client outreach,

43
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,127
but every time they would talk
to a Sandpiper resident,

44
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:16,062
Jimmy's name would come up.

45
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:18,831
You know, he...

46
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:20,803
- Those old folks, they just...
- They love him.

47
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:23,169
Yeah, they do. ‭mm-hmm.

48
00:04:23,204 --> 00:04:27,407
Plus, I guess Cliff thought
it would be a good idea

49
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:30,643
for the case to have that sort of, uh...

50
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:33,313
You know... continuity.

51
00:04:33,348 --> 00:04:34,380
Mm.

52
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:37,507
Jimmy certainly has a way with people.

53
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:39,265
He does.

54
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:44,857
They're aware of his background
at Davis & Main?

55
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:46,518
His education?

56
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:47,945
In the spirit of full disclosure,

57
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,097
Cliff did talk to me beforehand.

58
00:04:51,132 --> 00:04:52,465
I didn't pull any punches.

59
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:55,487
I tried to paint a complete picture.

60
00:04:57,178 --> 00:04:58,544
But I didn't stand in the way.

61
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:00,974
Of course not.

62
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,976
Nor should you.

63
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,612
Truth be told...

64
00:05:05,647 --> 00:05:09,482
Kim Wexler pushed for this... hard.

65
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:15,555
But I didn't, uh,
you know, stand in the way.

66
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,323
Partner track?

67
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:21,628
I would, uh...

68
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:23,396
Yeah.

69
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:25,331
Assume so.

70
00:05:27,714 --> 00:05:29,850
That's great.

71
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,639
Good for Jimmy.

72
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:34,407
Charlie Hustle, right?

73
00:05:34,442 --> 00:05:35,475
Yep.

74
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,845
‭Yep.

75
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,923
Well, I'll get out of your hair.

76
00:05:41,102 --> 00:05:42,868
Anything else you need me
to add to Ernie's list?

77
00:05:42,893 --> 00:05:45,327
No. All set. All good.

78
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:47,387
Thanks for coming by, Howard.

79
00:05:47,422 --> 00:05:49,922
Any time. You truly are missed.

80
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,491
No pressure.

Document review
will be coordinated through HHM.

83
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:30,095
To date, the following documents

84
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:32,048
have been requested from Sandpiper

85
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,884
as part of our initial discovery petition.

86
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,987
One... resident lease
agreements, past and present,

87
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:39,989
from all Sandpiper locations.

88
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:43,126
Two... invoices and transaction documents

89
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:46,028
from all supply companies
used by Sandpiper.

90
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:48,564
Three... list of all past and present

91
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,833
official Sandpiper vendors.

92
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:54,203
Four... any and all business
agreements and contracts

93
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:57,206
between Sandpiper and its distributors.

94
00:07:57,242 --> 00:08:01,844
Five... records of residents'
social security check receipts.

95
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,515
Six... allowance transaction statements.

96
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,718
Seven... resident invoices
non-related to sup...

97
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,655
I'm loving the new look.

98
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,891
How's Santa Fe?

99
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:16,659
It's, uh...

100
00:08:16,694 --> 00:08:19,395
It's... It's really...

101
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,665
See? What'd I tell you?

102
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,667
Nice place?

103
00:08:24,702 --> 00:08:27,737
The finest in temporary corporate housing.

104
00:08:27,772 --> 00:08:30,673
Can't wait to see it.

105
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,675
Maybe I should leave HHM.

106
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,344
Get on that cushy D&M train.

107
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,381
It is very cushy.

108
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,449
It's amazing.

109
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:45,121
Jimmy...

110
00:08:45,156 --> 00:08:47,690
I'm so happy for you.

111
00:08:47,725 --> 00:08:49,525
Thanks.

112
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:52,395
You know, things are really turning around.

113
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,397
I'm even thinking of looking, you know,

114
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:56,699
my own place to buy.

115
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:59,602
- In Santa Fe?
- Not sure yet.

116
00:08:59,637 --> 00:09:02,705
Maybe someplace, uh, closer to Albuquerque

117
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,707
since I'm going between the two so much.

118
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:06,108
Okay.

119
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:08,978
So, halfway points.

120
00:09:09,013 --> 00:09:10,613
Um... ‭yeah, I was thinking, uh...

121
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:12,048
- Oh, wait, what about Corrales?
- Corrales.

122
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,716
Yeah, get a nice, little bungalow,

123
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:15,418
or maybe not so little.

124
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:16,819
Big, open floor plan.

125
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:19,889
I don't want any walls
disrupting my chi, yeah.

126
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:22,358
Uh, but I'm thinking I definitely want

127
00:09:22,397 --> 00:09:25,132
some decent acreage,
get in touch with nature.

128
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,033
Horses.

129
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:29,369
Come on. You could get horses.

130
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:31,304
Man, that would be so amazing.

131
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,007
Too expensive. They, uh,
all the oats... right?

132
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:35,475
It's oats ‭that they're always eating?

133
00:09:35,511 --> 00:09:37,377
It's worth it. ‭and the horseshoes.

134
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:40,347
You have to get them shoes
and nail them with a hammer.

135
00:09:40,382 --> 00:09:41,582
- It's totally worth it.
- It's...

136
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:42,958
Long ride through the country

137
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:47,461
and then glass of wine
on the back patio at sunset.

138
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:52,092
Oh, we should get one of those smokers.

139
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:53,727
We could just barbecue for days.

140
00:09:53,763 --> 00:09:58,766
Yeah. We definitely
‭ got to get a smoker.

141
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:08,942
All right, well...

142
00:10:08,978 --> 00:10:10,656
I got to go to the salon.

143
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:13,580
They're delivering my new company car.

144
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:15,791
Ugh, are you serious?

145
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:17,888
What?

146
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:20,524
Jeeves, ‭where's my solid-gold blimp?

147
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,426
No, not that one. The other one.

148
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:23,861
Jealous.

149
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:26,497
Totally.

150
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
Oh, I forgot.
‭I got you a present. One sec.

151
00:10:42,682 --> 00:10:45,449
Such a beautiful wrapping job.

152
00:10:45,484 --> 00:10:46,617
It's a shame to open it.

153
00:10:46,652 --> 00:10:48,185
It's a gift. Be grateful.

154
00:10:53,432 --> 00:10:56,399
Just keeping it real.

155
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:57,795
Come on.

156
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,465
Second is still very, very good.

157
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,033
All right.

158
00:11:10,476 --> 00:11:12,176
Thanks.

159
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:13,410
See you tonight?

160
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:16,080
Maybe.

161
00:11:16,115 --> 00:11:18,983
If you play your cards right.

162
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:50,481
Hello, beautiful.

163
00:11:54,186 --> 00:11:55,519
What do you think, ladies?

164
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,156
Yeah, I know, right?

165
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:00,791
It's got all leather interior,

166
00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:04,528
heated seats for those
cold desert mornings.

167
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:07,031
This must be what heaven looks like.

168
00:12:15,908 --> 00:12:17,474
Hey!

169
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,743
Goodbye hug?

170
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:20,889
No?

171
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:23,347
All right,
well, forgo the tears

172
00:12:23,382 --> 00:12:26,016
and just say, "till we meet again."

173
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:02,953
Must be metric.

174
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,883
Hey!

175
00:14:10,623 --> 00:14:13,157
What...
What are you doing here?

176
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:15,159
I work here.

177
00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:17,895
Oh. Small world.

178
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,833
So, is this the parking lot
for the police station?

179
00:14:22,868 --> 00:14:24,501
It is.

180
00:14:24,537 --> 00:14:26,837
You don't know if they validate, do you?

181
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:32,009
Why don't you pull around over there,

182
00:14:32,044 --> 00:14:34,845
and we'll have a little talk.

183
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,381
Uh, okay.

184
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,766
Why are you here?

185
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:58,669
I... I have business with the police.

186
00:14:58,704 --> 00:15:01,171
And what business might that be?

187
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:04,675
Well, if you must know, I was robbed.

188
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,511
Somebody broke into my house
and stole my property.

189
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:09,012
Your drugs.

190
00:15:09,048 --> 00:15:11,615
Yeah, but obviously
‭I didn't tell the cops that.

191
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,484
I'm not stupid.

192
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,053
You've already spoken to them?

193
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:18,355
A couple of them came by my house.

194
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,824
But it's not the drugs that I care about.

195
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,559
I mean, I care.

196
00:15:22,595 --> 00:15:24,228
It's my baseball cards

197
00:15:24,263 --> 00:15:25,996
I need back.

198
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:30,300
- Your baseball cards?
- Yes.

199
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:33,537
I have a very valuable
collection of baseball cards,

200
00:15:33,572 --> 00:15:35,239
and someone stole them.

201
00:15:35,274 --> 00:15:38,542
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
I have to tell you this.

202
00:15:38,577 --> 00:15:40,811
But it's probably a bad idea

203
00:15:40,846 --> 00:15:42,880
that you willingly talk to the police,

204
00:15:42,915 --> 00:15:44,248
being a criminal and all.

205
00:15:44,283 --> 00:15:46,817
I'm not here as a criminal.

206
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:48,519
I'm here as a crime victim.

207
00:15:48,554 --> 00:15:53,991
Just because I occasionally sell
some pharmaceuticals,

208
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:57,394
I no longer have a right
to protection from crime?

209
00:15:57,429 --> 00:16:00,430
And I was very careful
when I talked to them.

210
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:04,434
I... they have no idea
about my other business.

211
00:16:05,938 --> 00:16:08,405
If you already made your report,
why are you here?

212
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,673
They called me.

213
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,208
They have a few more questions.

214
00:16:11,243 --> 00:16:15,445
They are very dedicated
to finding this thief.

215
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:19,516
Since you're new to this,
let me explain it to you.

216
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:22,853
They've invited you on a fishing trip.

217
00:16:22,888 --> 00:16:25,055
What's that? A fishing trip?

218
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:28,792
Those cops have no interest in
helping you get your cards back.

219
00:16:28,827 --> 00:16:30,928
You're obviously under suspicion.

220
00:16:30,963 --> 00:16:33,230
There was nothing there for them to see.

221
00:16:33,265 --> 00:16:36,033
I refer you ‭to our previous conversation

222
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:40,137
and this blinking neon sign of a
vehicle that says "drug dealer."

223
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:41,705
They suspect you.

224
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,241
They will get you in there,
pretend to be your friend,

225
00:16:44,293 --> 00:16:47,494
lull you into a false sense of security,

226
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:50,363
and then they will sweat you.

227
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,265
And you will break.

228
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:54,467
I don't... I...

229
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:56,202
I disagree.

230
00:16:56,238 --> 00:16:59,439
Not open for debate. You go home now.

231
00:16:59,474 --> 00:17:01,007
But I have an appointment.

232
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:02,375
Break it.

233
00:17:02,411 --> 00:17:04,644
And if they call you,
do not answer the phone.

234
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,680
But what about my baseball cards?

235
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:08,448
- Cost of doing business.
- No!

236
00:17:08,483 --> 00:17:10,317
No, no, no!

237
00:17:10,352 --> 00:17:12,118
I am getting those back!

238
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:13,787
I will take the risk!

239
00:17:13,822 --> 00:17:15,455
No, you won't.

240
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,458
Because then you'll be putting
my well-being at risk.

241
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:20,026
I have to!

242
00:17:20,062 --> 00:17:23,129
I... I...

243
00:17:23,165 --> 00:17:26,199
Those cards?

244
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:29,803
Some of them were my dad's.

245
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:33,239
I... I am getting them back.

246
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:35,675
I'm getting them back.

247
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:48,355
I'll find your cards.

248
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,692
Is... ser...

249
00:17:52,728 --> 00:17:55,362
is that something you do?

250
00:17:56,698 --> 00:17:58,498
Wow, that's...

251
00:17:58,533 --> 00:18:00,734
That is so generous of you.

252
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:02,969
Oh, it'll cost you.

253
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:06,740
Oh.

254
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:09,876
Okay, uh...

255
00:18:09,911 --> 00:18:14,581
We should discuss some sort
of financial arrangement

256
00:18:14,616 --> 00:18:17,050
in which I... I, uh...

257
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:19,152
Oh.

258
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:23,023
Okay, then!

259
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:24,591
Jesus.

260
00:19:57,804 --> 00:19:59,338
Come on in.

261
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:00,817
I didn't mean to interrupt.

262
00:20:00,842 --> 00:20:03,309
Not at all. I was just
blowing off some steam.

263
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:05,985
- You sound good.
- Thank you.

264
00:20:06,113 --> 00:20:07,888
Clears the head. You play?

265
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:09,589
Oh, I tried to learn in high school,

266
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:13,358
but then I decided there were
easier ways to get girls.

267
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:15,294
Well, I hope
you've got a way to decompress.

268
00:20:15,351 --> 00:20:17,118
Everybody needs something.

269
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:18,493
How you settling in?

270
00:20:18,493 --> 00:20:19,793
Great.

271
00:20:19,828 --> 00:20:23,964
Uh, it's... ‭it's quite a step up for me.

272
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:26,066
Well, we're happy to have you.

273
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:29,469
Just let us know if there's
anything else you need, Jimmy.

274
00:20:29,504 --> 00:20:31,604
Thanks... Cliff.

275
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,274
Um, I'm happy to be here.

276
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:36,776
Great.

277
00:20:36,812 --> 00:20:38,678
Uh, better get back to it.

278
00:20:38,714 --> 00:20:40,680
Yeah, me, too, I suppose.

279
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:42,582
Um...

280
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:45,251
Actually, um, ‭I might
have found something

281
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:47,520
in the initial disclosures.

282
00:20:47,556 --> 00:20:50,190
Oh, yeah? Schweikart and
Cokely keep referring to

283
00:20:50,225 --> 00:20:52,158
the "optional allowance program,"

284
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:54,160
but I checked a number
of residents' contracts.

285
00:20:54,196 --> 00:20:56,796
Not a single one has opted out,
which makes me think

286
00:20:56,832 --> 00:20:59,532
it's more of a mandatory
financial arrangement.

287
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:01,334
And you're thinking that's
the "failure to state a claim"

288
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,969
that they filed in their answer?

289
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:05,438
They keep saying it's optional,
thereby voluntary.

290
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:06,973
I think we can counter that

291
00:21:07,009 --> 00:21:09,442
if "opting in" is a requirement
for residency,

292
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:10,877
which it sure seems to be,

293
00:21:10,912 --> 00:21:14,581
well, their voluntary claims
don't hold water.

294
00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:19,352
Might be on to something here.

295
00:21:19,388 --> 00:21:22,255
Nice work, Jimmy.

296
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:25,592
Thanks, Cliff.

297
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:40,473
Hola.

298
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:43,143
Hola. ¿cómo estás?

299
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:45,011
Welcome. How can I help you?

300
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:47,547
Um, I was hoping to get an estimate.

301
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:49,249
Uh, mi car. Mi coche.

302
00:21:49,284 --> 00:21:50,884
You do cars?

303
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:53,420
Sí. Cars. Todo el tiempo. ‭ah.

304
00:21:53,455 --> 00:21:56,089
I... I was hoping to get
my seats reupholstered.

305
00:21:56,124 --> 00:21:58,691
Um... Mm.

306
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:01,861
Um, take a look? ¿mira?

307
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:13,606
- Un momento.
- Sí, sí, sí, sí.

308
00:22:29,124 --> 00:22:31,491
Gracias.

309
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:43,703
Yeah.

310
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:45,638
Thinking something new.

311
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:49,275
Give the old girl a little love.

312
00:22:56,651 --> 00:22:59,085
He said you should save
your money and get a new car.

313
00:22:59,121 --> 00:23:02,422
Yeah? Well, it has a sentimental value.

314
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:09,262
- Classic car.
- Mmm.

315
00:23:13,468 --> 00:23:15,335
Um, what material do you want?

316
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,671
Well, I was thinking leather, definitely.

317
00:23:18,707 --> 00:23:21,774
Uh, maybe alligator.

318
00:23:25,313 --> 00:23:27,947
Señor. Too much money.

319
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:30,850
Yeah, but like I said,
it has a sentimental value.

320
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:50,336
He says, uh, alligator's
gonna look all wrong.

321
00:23:50,372 --> 00:23:52,705
Cheaper might be better.

322
00:23:52,741 --> 00:23:56,142
Well, show me what you'd pick.

323
00:23:59,414 --> 00:24:02,982
Ooh. I'm sorry, señor.

324
00:24:03,018 --> 00:24:06,052
Uh, my son... He...
He will help you, okay?

325
00:24:14,623 --> 00:24:16,323
Ah, mucho gusto.

326
00:24:35,912 --> 00:24:37,545
How'd you find me?

327
00:24:43,987 --> 00:24:45,446
Why are you here?

328
00:24:45,446 --> 00:24:47,780
Baseball cards.

329
00:24:47,815 --> 00:24:51,850
The way I figure, you saw that
mid-life crisis of a vehicle

330
00:24:51,886 --> 00:24:53,852
and wisely decided
‭to cut ties with the man,

331
00:24:53,888 --> 00:24:56,088
and I don't blame you... I did, too.

332
00:24:56,123 --> 00:24:57,856
And then you ripped him off.

333
00:24:57,892 --> 00:25:00,326
And I'm sure those baseball cards

334
00:25:00,361 --> 00:25:02,528
looked like an easy way
to make a few extra bucks

335
00:25:02,563 --> 00:25:05,297
off that idiot, teach him a lesson, too.

336
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:06,965
But you underestimated

337
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:09,301
just how big an idiot
you were dealing with.

338
00:25:09,337 --> 00:25:12,438
No, I am pretty aware.

339
00:25:12,473 --> 00:25:13,939
Well, then, you underestimated

340
00:25:13,974 --> 00:25:15,541
how attached the man was to those cards...

341
00:25:15,576 --> 00:25:20,012
so attached, he called the police
and reported them stolen.

342
00:25:20,047 --> 00:25:21,847
Now they're nosing around.

343
00:25:23,584 --> 00:25:26,352
That sounds like a "you" problem.

344
00:25:26,387 --> 00:25:28,520
No, I think it's very much an "us" problem.

345
00:25:28,556 --> 00:25:30,723
Yeah, I guess I'll just
have to take my chances.

346
00:25:30,758 --> 00:25:32,891
But Good luck to you.

347
00:25:32,927 --> 00:25:34,693
You know, I was hoping
you'd see our dilemma

348
00:25:34,729 --> 00:25:36,328
and do the right thing.

349
00:25:36,364 --> 00:25:38,130
But I think what we have here now

350
00:25:38,165 --> 00:25:41,066
is a carrot-and-stick situation.

351
00:25:41,102 --> 00:25:44,036
Oh, yeah?

352
00:25:44,071 --> 00:25:47,306
This the stick? Hmm?

353
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:50,409
You coming here, threatening my family?

354
00:25:50,444 --> 00:25:52,177
Huh?

355
00:25:52,213 --> 00:25:55,080
'Cause you're gonna need
a bigger stick, old man.

356
00:26:00,054 --> 00:26:02,888
I'm not here to threaten your family.

357
00:26:04,392 --> 00:26:08,026
And the name of the stick
is Tuco Salamanca.

358
00:26:08,062 --> 00:26:12,731
Now, you don't play ball, so to speak,

359
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:16,602
and Tuco finds out about
your little side business.

360
00:26:16,637 --> 00:26:19,238
That a big enough stick?

361
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:25,911
However, I prefer the carrot.

362
00:26:25,946 --> 00:26:28,247
I think you will, too.

363
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,450
And what would that be?

364
00:26:31,485 --> 00:26:35,421
You give me back the baseball cards,

365
00:26:35,456 --> 00:26:37,523
$10,000 in cash,

366
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:44,163
and you net roughly... roughly... $60,000.

367
00:26:47,501 --> 00:26:50,569
And how exactly does that work?

368
00:27:38,732 --> 00:27:41,065
Ernesto?

369
00:27:46,506 --> 00:27:48,306
Hey.

370
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,977
Going somewhere?

371
00:27:52,012 --> 00:27:54,879
Yes, we are.

372
00:27:54,915 --> 00:27:59,711
She's a little tricky
around the corners.

373
00:27:59,736 --> 00:28:00,404
So...

374
00:28:00,404 --> 00:28:02,884
and you got to go with the premium gas.

375
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:07,201
I know it seems like a scam,
but it makes a huge difference.

376
00:28:07,236 --> 00:28:09,920
And I would get her washed
at least once a week.

377
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,486
And spring for the hand wax.

378
00:28:11,522 --> 00:28:14,056
You're gonna want that
extra layer of protection

379
00:28:14,091 --> 00:28:15,591
for the clear coat.

380
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,929
She deserves the best.

381
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:23,498
I'll make sure the boys at the chop shop

382
00:28:23,498 --> 00:28:24,931
are real gentle with her.

383
00:28:28,603 --> 00:28:31,404
Wait. W-why?

384
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,541
No.

385
00:28:34,576 --> 00:28:36,910
You think I'd be caught dead
driving that thing?

386
00:28:36,945 --> 00:28:39,528
It looks like a school bus
for 6-year-old pimps.

387
00:28:39,527 --> 00:28:42,728
All right, shall we move this along?

388
00:29:14,308 --> 00:29:15,923
Aaron.

389
00:29:17,744 --> 00:29:19,544
Okay, there's Jeter.

390
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,576
All right. Okay.

391
00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:32,538
Mantle. Mantle. There's Mantle.

392
00:29:32,893 --> 00:29:34,092
We good?

393
00:29:34,128 --> 00:29:36,927
Uh, yeah, that looks like everyone.

394
00:29:36,927 --> 00:29:39,828
Yeah, they're here.
‭looks like everyone's here.

395
00:29:45,903 --> 00:29:48,403
And now the other item.

396
00:30:04,922 --> 00:30:09,224
And now our business is concluded.

397
00:30:55,806 --> 00:31:00,041
You know, I can't help thinking
an apology was in order.

398
00:31:02,813 --> 00:31:04,679
Uh, it's... it's the police again.

399
00:31:08,485 --> 00:31:09,918
Sandpiper hasn't really responded

400
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:11,086
to our discovery requests.

401
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:12,449
They've buried us in paperwork,

402
00:31:12,449 --> 00:31:15,216
but nothing actually relevant
to the particulars in this case.

403
00:31:15,252 --> 00:31:16,751
No real surprise there.

404
00:31:17,338 --> 00:31:19,865
We may have to subpoena their bank records.
Thank you, Erin.

405
00:31:20,331 --> 00:31:21,162
Jimmy.

406
00:31:21,162 --> 00:31:22,662
How we doing with client outreach?

407
00:31:23,297 --> 00:31:25,099
Oh, while we're waiting on those subpoenas,

408
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:27,640
I'm thinking we should t
wrangling some of this stuff

409
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,938
from the clients themselves.

410
00:31:28,938 --> 00:31:31,672
Most of these folks
have hard copies of everything

411
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:34,508
going back to the
Eisenhower administration.

412
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:37,011
Of course, given some of their, uh...

413
00:31:37,046 --> 00:31:40,247
Inconsistent organizational practices,

414
00:31:40,283 --> 00:31:42,583
it's gonna be slow going.

415
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,560
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

416
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,711
Uh, this one lady, um, she's sweet,

417
00:31:48,711 --> 00:31:50,945
but, uh, deaf as a doornail.

418
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,782
She keeps all of her paperwork
in, um, she keeps it...

419
00:31:54,818 --> 00:31:56,250
I'm sorry. Excuse me, Jimmy.

420
00:31:56,286 --> 00:31:57,485
I'm gonna need everybody's phone,

421
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,654
key fobs, and electronics.

422
00:32:32,822 --> 00:32:35,087
Chuck. Welcome.

423
00:32:35,191 --> 00:32:37,191
Please. Have a seat.

424
00:32:37,594 --> 00:32:39,227
Don't mind me.

425
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:42,111
Hey, everybody.

426
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:50,204
Sorry for the interruption.

427
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,873
Just pretend I'm not here.

428
00:32:51,908 --> 00:32:54,375
Happy to have you.

429
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,410
Jimmy, where were we?

430
00:32:56,446 --> 00:32:59,547
Uh, yeah.

431
00:32:59,582 --> 00:33:01,883
So, I was saying...

432
00:33:03,219 --> 00:33:05,082
Um...

433
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:10,906
Uh, getting the documents
from some of the clients...

434
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:17,398
We definitely have some pack rats.

435
00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:18,979
God bless 'em.

436
00:33:18,979 --> 00:33:22,838
I was visiting Mrs. Gusdorff
at, uh, Sandpiper Santa Fe,

437
00:33:22,998 --> 00:33:27,152
and I spent the whole afternoon
sorting through just a haystack

438
00:33:27,187 --> 00:33:30,622
of recipes and half-off coupons
from big lots.

439
00:33:30,658 --> 00:33:34,626
But now we've got copies of
this woman's monthly statements

440
00:33:34,662 --> 00:33:37,195
going back to March 1997,

441
00:33:37,231 --> 00:33:39,931
so it might be a little labor-intensive,

442
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:44,102
but our clients will always be
our best resource.

443
00:33:44,138 --> 00:33:46,204
Plus, they have ribbon candy.

444
00:33:56,684 --> 00:33:58,183
Jimmy.

445
00:33:59,186 --> 00:34:01,353
Hello?

446
00:34:08,395 --> 00:34:09,795
What are you doing here?

447
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:13,465
‭My name is on the building.

448
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,033
So great to have you here.

449
00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:17,502
If you need anything, I'll be in my office.

450
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:26,611
Why are you here?

451
00:34:28,215 --> 00:34:30,549
To bear witness.

452
00:34:41,862 --> 00:34:43,829
James McGill.

453
00:34:43,864 --> 00:34:45,864
It's Ehrmantraut.

454
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:48,100
You still morally flexible?

455
00:34:48,135 --> 00:34:51,870
If so, I might have a job for you.

456
00:34:53,707 --> 00:34:56,742
Where and when?

457
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:05,963
Take a seat.

458
00:35:08,636 --> 00:35:11,594
Mr. Wormald, thank you
for coming in and talking to us.

459
00:35:11,594 --> 00:35:12,860
Yeah, of course.

460
00:35:12,895 --> 00:35:14,361
Yeah, we've been looking at the reports

461
00:35:14,397 --> 00:35:16,096
that the officers took at the scene,

462
00:35:16,132 --> 00:35:18,632
and we have a few
‭small follow-up questions.

463
00:35:18,668 --> 00:35:21,368
Uh, sorry to waste your time.
Just standard stuff.

464
00:35:21,404 --> 00:35:23,103
There's really no need
for a lawyer to be here.

465
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:25,906
I'm here in more of an advisory capacity.

466
00:35:25,942 --> 00:35:29,076
Dan just, uh, wanted
a friendly face next to him.

467
00:35:29,111 --> 00:35:31,412
‭Well, we're all friendly here.

468
00:35:31,447 --> 00:35:33,914
Look at us. Four friends.

469
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:36,316
We just want to get the facts straight

470
00:35:36,352 --> 00:35:38,652
so we can, um, help you get
your property for you.

471
00:35:38,687 --> 00:35:40,721
Yeah, you know, uh, it's fine.

472
00:35:40,756 --> 00:35:43,790
Uh, yeah, there's no need to, uh...

473
00:35:43,826 --> 00:35:45,826
No, it's just standard procedure.

474
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,800
You know, ‭officers don't always get

475
00:35:47,835 --> 00:35:50,169
all the information we
need in their report.

476
00:35:50,203 --> 00:35:53,104
We just want to find the guys
who took your baseball cards.

477
00:35:53,139 --> 00:35:55,773
Yeah, that's, uh...

478
00:35:55,809 --> 00:35:58,509
You know, my uncle
‭had a Ty Cobb tobacco card.

479
00:35:58,545 --> 00:36:01,579
Kept that thing behind six inches of glass

480
00:36:01,614 --> 00:36:03,314
like it was the Mona Lisa or something.

481
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:05,349
Wow. Ty Cobb?

482
00:36:05,385 --> 00:36:06,784
Tell him to keep the lights low.

483
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,120
Even artificial lighting
has a certain amount

484
00:36:09,155 --> 00:36:14,121
of ultraviolet radiation
that can, uh, you know...

485
00:36:14,122 --> 00:36:15,621
- Over the long term...
- Yeah.

486
00:36:15,657 --> 00:36:17,924
Um, can you just remind us

487
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:20,893
exactly where you kept
your cards in the house?

488
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:25,631
Yeah, well, uh, as I was trying
to say, it's no longer an issue.

489
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:28,334
I found them.

490
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:30,298
So you found the cards?

491
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:32,004
Uh, yep.

492
00:36:32,005 --> 00:36:36,941
I just wanted to come down and
tell you, you know, in person.

493
00:36:36,976 --> 00:36:38,743
You found them?

494
00:36:38,778 --> 00:36:40,478
Where? Around the house?

495
00:36:40,513 --> 00:36:43,748
No. I, uh, I hired a private investigator,

496
00:36:43,783 --> 00:36:45,917
and he tracked them down.

497
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,318
So, yeah.

498
00:36:47,353 --> 00:36:50,827
Really? So, where were they?

499
00:36:50,828 --> 00:36:53,156
You know, it's fine. It is.

500
00:36:53,223 --> 00:36:55,630
I really... I ought to
get out of your hair.

501
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:58,300
Uh, you've wasted enough time on me.

502
00:36:58,335 --> 00:37:01,136
No, no, it's... ‭it's okay. It's our job.

503
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:03,188
We just want to get the facts right

504
00:37:03,213 --> 00:37:05,854
so we can help close this case for you.

505
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,567
It's done.

506
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:10,836
Case closed!

507
00:37:10,871 --> 00:37:13,083
I just... I know how much, you know,

508
00:37:13,084 --> 00:37:14,751
you guys have on your hands,

509
00:37:14,798 --> 00:37:18,333
like murderers and robbers
and gangs and stuff. I...

510
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:21,505
Hey, Danny, ‭why don't you get some air?

511
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:22,805
You can have some coffee.

512
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,441
I'll finish up ‭with the detectives here.

513
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:36,418
Okay, let's get down
to brass tacks here, guys.

514
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,655
I'm guessing your two
fine uniformed officers

515
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,590
found Mr. Wormald's little hidey hole,

516
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,659
and that's why you two are so interested

517
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,352
in "helping" my friend here.

518
00:37:45,352 --> 00:37:46,888
I get it.

519
00:37:46,888 --> 00:37:48,885
A hiding place in the baseboard...

520
00:37:49,178 --> 00:37:50,666
it's gonna make anyone suspicious.

521
00:37:50,691 --> 00:37:54,193
But let me assure you there's
nothing illegal going on here.

522
00:37:54,818 --> 00:37:56,342
Then why is he so nervous?

523
00:37:56,342 --> 00:37:59,109
Mm-hmm. 'Cause I must say, the
flop sweat is kind of suspect.

524
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:02,111
We all have our secrets, don't we?

525
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:04,481
And who among us is without sin?

526
00:38:04,522 --> 00:38:08,053
But those sins aren't all
of the criminal variety,

527
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:10,545
and neither are Mr. Wormald's, okay?

528
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:13,223
They are, however, very private.

529
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:15,492
Private, like drug dealer, maybe?

530
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,021
No, no!

531
00:38:17,022 --> 00:38:19,589
He's being evasive because
it's a sensitive subject,

532
00:38:19,624 --> 00:38:23,560
very delicate, and of no concern
to law enforcement.

533
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:27,168
You know, as much as we'd love
to, um, take your word for it,

534
00:38:27,193 --> 00:38:28,665
we're gonna need a little more than that.

535
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,669
All right, well, this all comes
down to a personal dispute.

536
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,037
That's all.

537
00:38:34,072 --> 00:38:36,977
It's... it's between, um, Mr. Wormald

538
00:38:37,002 --> 00:38:41,811
and, uh... his art patron.

539
00:38:43,563 --> 00:38:44,381
- "Art patron"?
- Yeah.

540
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:50,057
Uh, my client has an arrangement
with a wealthy gentleman

541
00:38:50,557 --> 00:38:54,090
for whom
Mr. Wormald provides...

542
00:38:55,484 --> 00:39:00,096
Art in exchange for
‭this gentleman's generous, uh...

543
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:03,266
We'll call it patronage.

544
00:39:03,301 --> 00:39:06,436
Art? Like... like what? Paintings?

545
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:09,239
It's more like digital media.

546
00:39:09,274 --> 00:39:11,541
Digital media?

547
00:39:11,576 --> 00:39:14,051
He made videos for the man.

548
00:39:14,115 --> 00:39:15,324
What kind of videos?

549
00:39:15,514 --> 00:39:18,314
Private videos of an artistic nature.

550
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,483
That's what was in the hiding place.

551
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:22,152
That's what it's for.

552
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:29,259
So, this art patron stole the
videos and the baseball cards?

553
00:39:29,294 --> 00:39:31,294
Well, there was a misunderstanding.

554
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:33,830
I mean, uh, ‭call it creative differences.

555
00:39:33,865 --> 00:39:36,599
Artists are volatile creatures.

556
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:42,838
Guys, this all comes down
to just a lovers' spat, okay?

557
00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:46,311
Two consenting adults had a falling out.

558
00:39:46,336 --> 00:39:47,076
That happens.

559
00:39:47,112 --> 00:39:50,513
And the, uh, "patron" stole the videos

560
00:39:50,549 --> 00:39:53,283
and the baseball cards, uh,
to "make a point," I guess.

561
00:39:53,318 --> 00:39:56,586
But the headline here is, it's all settled.

562
00:39:56,621 --> 00:39:57,921
Hearts have mended,

563
00:39:57,956 --> 00:40:01,791
and Mr. Wormald will not
be pressing charges.

564
00:40:01,827 --> 00:40:05,195
What was on these videos?

565
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,831
- They were private.
- You've said that.

566
00:40:09,334 --> 00:40:16,240
They were videos intended
to titillate the senses.

567
00:40:16,975 --> 00:40:19,476
- Okay, so porn.
- Not... no.

568
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:21,211
Not as such.

569
00:40:21,246 --> 00:40:24,681
Technically, they would be
categorized as fetish videos.

570
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:26,516
But nothing illegal.

571
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:29,319
Just a man... a fully
clothed man, I might add...

572
00:40:29,354 --> 00:40:31,787
just all by himself.

573
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:37,827
Just... just Mr. Wormald
fully clothed, uh, yeah.

574
00:40:37,863 --> 00:40:40,697
So... all right.

575
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:48,491
So, fully clothed Mr. Wormald
by himself doing what?

576
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:49,965
Yeah, come on, man. What?

577
00:40:51,543 --> 00:40:55,044
Squat cobbler.

578
00:40:56,349 --> 00:40:58,648
What's a s-squat cobbler?

579
00:40:58,683 --> 00:41:01,050
Squat cobbler.
‭You know what squat cobbler is.

580
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:02,886
No, I don't... I don't know
what a squat cobbler is.

581
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:05,321
No, me neither. What is it?

582
00:41:05,357 --> 00:41:07,390
What? And you two guys are cops?

583
00:41:07,425 --> 00:41:11,027
Hoboken squat cobbler.

584
00:41:11,062 --> 00:41:13,596
Full moon moon-pie.

585
00:41:13,632 --> 00:41:17,367
Boston cream splat.

586
00:41:17,402 --> 00:41:18,601
Seriously?

587
00:41:18,637 --> 00:41:21,437
Simple-Simon-the-ass-man.

588
00:41:21,473 --> 00:41:23,168
Dutch apple ass.

589
00:41:23,168 --> 00:41:26,202
Guys, am I not speaking English here?

590
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:27,702
What the hell is a squat cobbler?!

591
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:29,604
It's when a man sits in pie!

592
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,507
He sits in a pie!

593
00:41:32,543 --> 00:41:36,211
And he... he wiggles around.

594
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,681
Maybe it's like hellmann's mayonnaise.

595
00:41:39,716 --> 00:41:41,883
It has a different name
west of the rockies.

596
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:43,685
I don't know. But, uh, technically,

597
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,555
he does a crybaby squat, so there's tears,

598
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,623
which makes it more specialized.

599
00:41:48,659 --> 00:41:50,725
Not all pie sitters cry.

600
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:52,327
But I'm gonna tell you something.

601
00:41:52,362 --> 00:41:54,952
This guy is a regular Julianne Moore

602
00:41:54,977 --> 00:41:56,709
once he gets ‭the waterworks cranked up.

603
00:41:56,733 --> 00:41:58,667
Pies?

604
00:41:58,702 --> 00:42:00,001
What? Like apple?

605
00:42:00,037 --> 00:42:01,703
Guys, I'm not ‭the
filmmaker here, all right?

606
00:42:01,738 --> 00:42:05,978
Banana cream. I... uh, peach.

607
00:42:05,978 --> 00:42:09,480
Oh, and there... And there
is a costume involved.

608
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:14,386
You got to be shitting us.

609
00:42:14,421 --> 00:42:17,822
Yeah, like I would make this up.

610
00:42:17,858 --> 00:42:22,227
Hey, the world is
‭a rich tapestry, my friends.

611
00:42:23,597 --> 00:42:24,963
But trust me on this.

612
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,270
You don't want to see it.

613
00:42:34,878 --> 00:42:37,979
So, uh, we're good, right?

614
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:41,385
Yeah. Great.

615
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:44,185
There is, however, one little,
tiny hanging Chad.

616
00:42:44,221 --> 00:42:46,221
Well, what? What Chad?

617
00:42:46,256 --> 00:42:48,289
You're gonna have to make a video.

618
00:43:11,781 --> 00:43:14,115
Wait. Wait.

619
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,834
So he eats the pies or just sits in them?

620
00:43:16,834 --> 00:43:19,001
Both. Whatever you want.

621
00:43:19,036 --> 00:43:20,836
Which comes first?

622
00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:22,671
Uh, it's dealer's choice.

623
00:43:23,624 --> 00:43:25,038
That's where the crying comes in, right?

624
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:26,609
That's a safe bet.

625
00:43:28,812 --> 00:43:30,524
How the hell ‭did you come up with that?

626
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,457
If you gave me a million years,

627
00:43:32,493 --> 00:43:34,159
I still would not have come up with that.

628
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,227
The muse.

629
00:43:35,262 --> 00:43:36,762
She speaks through me.

630
00:43:36,797 --> 00:43:38,897
I am but a humble vessel.

631
00:43:38,933 --> 00:43:40,165
And they bought it?

632
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,539
- Yeah.
- Wow.

633
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:43,594
I've heard some far-out
scenarios used to sow doubt,

634
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:44,907
but this definitely takes the cake.

635
00:43:44,942 --> 00:43:47,076
Kim, Kim, Kim.

636
00:43:47,602 --> 00:43:48,735
- Takes the pie.
- Yeah.

637
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,017
Sorry.

638
00:43:50,018 --> 00:43:51,684
I should just jump off the roof right now.

639
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,254
Yeah, you should feel bad about yourself.

640
00:43:54,289 --> 00:43:56,523
Jesus, can you tell a story.

641
00:43:57,291 --> 00:44:01,361
Well, to be fair, I think it was
the video that clinched it.

642
00:44:01,396 --> 00:44:03,630
What video?

643
00:44:04,604 --> 00:44:06,964
Wait, wait. You...
‭You actually made a video?

644
00:44:06,964 --> 00:44:09,722
I got to say, in the end,
ol' Dan really committed.

645
00:44:09,722 --> 00:44:12,156
I believed the tears.

646
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:16,994
Um, this is a leftover prop. It was extra.

647
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:20,531
I wasn't sure how many takes
we would need, so I over-bought,

648
00:44:20,566 --> 00:44:24,535
but I promise you,
‭untouched by human buttocks.

649
00:44:25,527 --> 00:44:27,271
You fabricated evidence?

650
00:44:27,306 --> 00:44:29,039
I made a video.

651
00:44:29,075 --> 00:44:30,708
Not exactly evidence.

652
00:44:30,743 --> 00:44:32,343
You used it to exonerate a client.

653
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:36,447
You used falsified evidence
to exonerate a client.

654
00:44:36,482 --> 00:44:38,760
Mm, I think you're splitting hairs.

655
00:44:38,785 --> 00:44:40,105
I'm not splitting hairs.

656
00:44:40,372 --> 00:44:43,854
What if Davis & Main find out
you faked evidence?

657
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,622
It wasn't a Davis & Main client.

658
00:44:45,658 --> 00:44:48,359
It was some nothing, little pro-bono thing.

659
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,494
It was off the clock. It was,
uh, totally my own thing.

660
00:44:50,529 --> 00:44:51,562
Why?

661
00:44:53,977 --> 00:44:56,533
Why would you risk
‭the best job you've ever had

662
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,502
for some pro-bono case?

663
00:44:58,537 --> 00:45:00,371
I was doing a favor for a friend.

664
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:03,307
Risking disbarment?
That's... that's some friend.

665
00:45:03,342 --> 00:45:05,809
It's fine! It... it worked out.

666
00:45:05,845 --> 00:45:07,678
Davis & Main are none the wiser.

667
00:45:07,713 --> 00:45:09,546
Jimmy, ‭you're playing with fire here.

668
00:45:10,295 --> 00:45:12,048
I didn't see you complaining

669
00:45:12,048 --> 00:45:15,316
when, um, Ken the douchebag paid
our bar bill the other night.

670
00:45:15,352 --> 00:45:18,053
No, that was a little bit
of rule breaking right there.

671
00:45:18,088 --> 00:45:20,689
And if I remember correctly, you liked it.

672
00:45:20,724 --> 00:45:21,990
A lot.

673
00:45:22,025 --> 00:45:24,326
That is so not the same thing.

674
00:45:24,361 --> 00:45:25,760
How? What's the difference?

675
00:45:25,796 --> 00:45:27,329
That had nothing to do with work.

676
00:45:27,364 --> 00:45:30,332
And we were just... just screwing around.

677
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:31,367
This?

678
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:34,236
Fabricating evidence.

679
00:45:34,271 --> 00:45:36,171
Jimmy, ‭this could really hurt you.

680
00:45:36,206 --> 00:45:38,073
If they find out, if you get caught...

681
00:45:38,108 --> 00:45:40,175
It... they're never gonna find out.

682
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:42,510
Seriously? You sound like
every dumb criminal out there.

683
00:45:42,546 --> 00:45:45,113
If you keep this up, they will find out.

684
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:48,934
- For what, Jimmy?
- ‭

685
00:45:51,054 --> 00:45:53,255
What is the point?

686
00:46:09,473 --> 00:46:12,241
I cannot hear ‭about this sort of thing.

687
00:46:13,277 --> 00:46:15,496
Ever again. Okay?

688
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:22,517
I mean it, Jimmy.

689
00:46:24,487 --> 00:46:26,420
You won't.
