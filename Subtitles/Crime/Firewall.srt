The interesting thing is...

100
00:06:47,847 --> 00:06:50,441
...he's coming in through Hong Kong,
Korea and Malaysia...

101
00:06:50,607 --> 00:06:53,679
...but he's trying sequential account
numbers. He's hacking all over.

- That'd slow me down.

106
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:12,404
- That'd be resistant to false positives.
- Yep.

- Huh.

110
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:22,643
MAN 2: That depends on how
you view the statistics.

111
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:25,958
They're not particularly high,
given the fact that...

112
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:30,325
...we're pushing the business into
some new and uncharted areas.

113
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:32,842
Online banking is where
the business is heading.

114
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:34,281
Where we have our branches...

115
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:37,837
...we'll provide our customers with
more ways to control their money.

116
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:40,123
As you can see by the chart,
after the merger...

117
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,881
...Accuwest will have 1100 branches
in 13 states...

118
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:46,323
...with over 100 billion in assets.
So to answer you, Harry, yes...

119
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:51,242
...we do see a reasonable level
of fraud loss as a cost of doing business.

120
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:54,001
- How many branches do you have?
- Twenty-seven.

121
00:07:54,887 --> 00:07:56,479
As head of network security, Jack...

122
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:59,844
...you've never really had to think
in terms of economies of scale.

123
00:08:00,007 --> 00:08:03,966
- But your philosophy of risk is...
JACK: Wait a second, Gary.

124
00:08:04,127 --> 00:08:08,439
Make this clear for me, will you?
What exactly is my philosophy of risk?

125
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:11,644
- No need to take this personally.
- I take it personally, goddamn it.

126
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:15,117
I've spent 20 years protecting this bank,
its customers and shareholders...

...from unnecessary risk.

128

Fraud loss is inevitable...

...pass it on to the customers
as the cost of doing business.

131

136

GARY: Network attacks...

137
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:50,961
...network activity.

138
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,558
- Where is this guy?
- He's in reception.

139
00:08:56,727 --> 00:08:58,922
He said it's personal.
Should I get him?

140
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:00,884
No, I'll walk over there.

- I know you.

144
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:15,963
- Do you have a card?
- Oh, yeah.

145
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,201
DHD Financial. What can I do for you?

146
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:23,119
You can give me
the $95,000 you owe me.

147
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:25,837
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No?

148
00:09:26,007 --> 00:09:28,680
I'm collecting for GambleNet U.S.A.
Does that ring a bell?

149
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:32,396
- No, it doesn't.
- You racked up 95,000 in online wagers.

150
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:34,922
And I got the paperwork to prove it.

151
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:37,362
You got the wrong Jack Stanfield.
I don't gamble.

152
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:41,156
- I don't have any debt. Check your facts.
- You're a deadbeat. See you in court.

153
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:43,921
- Laurie, call security.
- Don't bother, sweetheart.

154
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:48,205
Gambling's an addiction, Mr. Stanfield.
Get some help.

155
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:08,840
JANET: Well, I thought the idea
was to match it to the curtains.

156
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:11,521
- Yes, but if you do that...
- Nice flowers.

157
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:12,961
Bobby?

158
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:15,687
That would be the wrong thing to do,
don't you think?

159
00:10:16,527 --> 00:10:19,599
HARRY: What's up, partner?
- Take a look at this.

160
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:24,557
Wow. Who were you betting on?

161
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:26,319
I wasn't betting. I don't gamble.

162
00:10:26,487 --> 00:10:29,126
- I don't even know how.
- Well, that's obvious.

163
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:32,757
Think somebody got my information off
the bank's internal network or what?

164
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:34,804
Are you doubting yourself
in your old age?

165
