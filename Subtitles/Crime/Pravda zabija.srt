1
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,402
Blood pressure: 1 20 over 70.

2
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,600
Normal.

3
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,368
All right, open wide.

4
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,320
Looks fine. Healthy as a horse.

5
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,768
Just one more thing, Luther.

6
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,642
You got to whiz in the cup, Frank.

7
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,643
Then we're done.

8
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,244
Fuck them!

9
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,279
We going to argue
the merits of journalism?

10
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,528
You trying to tell me
that's journalism?

11
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,479
Look, Michelle. . .

12
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,803
. . .it's been a long weekend.

13
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,968
Everybody's shooting one another
and l've got to write about it.

14
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,249
l'm serious.
l'm tired of the crap, you know?

15
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,239
l should get my Ph.D. Then l could
write about stuff that matters.

16
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,762
You're 23 years old.
You don't know anything that matters.

17
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,559
Well, fuck you too, Ev!

18
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,165
All right, here's a shoulder.

19
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,444
-What did they do to you?
-Not ""they. "" He.

20
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,725
Alan.

21
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,328
He killed my sidebar
on the Frank Beechum murder.

22
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,165
That case stinks anyway,
but it's not the point.

23
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,680
-l read that sidebar.
-lt was good. Admit it.

24
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,528
Best l've written in months.

25
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,802
That was the one where you say
that the media. . .

26
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,924
. . .glorified Beechum's victim
to mask our patriarchal culture. . .

27
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,485
. . .which created the violence
that destroyed her.

28
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,409
You're right.
He should have never killed that.

29
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,601
-Fucking-A!
-l would've tortured it.

30
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,961
Well, it might have enjoyed that.

31
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,009
l think it would've enjoyed
every second of that.

32
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,359
Another round?

33
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,521
Another margarita for the lady,
and l'll have my usual.

34
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,488
Not your ''usual'' usual?

35
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,080
No, my new usual.

36
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,889
Virgin Mary.

37
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,442
And heavy on the. . .

38
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,844
. . .virgin?

39
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,799
Tell me something.

40
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,799
lf you're such hot shit, why are you
stuck here in Bumfuck, California?

41
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,525
Looking for love.

42
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,720
You've come to all the wrong places.

43
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,765
Not from where l sit.

44
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,325
lt's not good. Not smart.

45
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,638
-What's smart got to do with anything?
-l can't do this.

46
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,124
l got to go.

47
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,004
l got to go.
You're married and you're. . . .

48
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,968
l can't do this.

49
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,009
l got to go.

50
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,645
Next time?

51
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,363
Yeah, next time.

52
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,840
Frank!

53
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,489
We're out!

54
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,407
Just hold on. l can't hear you.

55
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,198
Morning, Frank.

56
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,078
Can l get you anything?

57
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,085
Some breakfast?

58
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,522
Well, if l can get, like. . .

59
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,320
. . .a roll and some coffee.

60
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,122
l'll get that right away.

61
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,689
You're not wearing
your protective glasses.

62
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,609
You heard about it?

63
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:52,766
What a tragedy.

64
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,768
The Raiders are a tragedy.
She drunk?

65
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,166
l don't know.
lt was Dead Man's Curve.

66
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,362
-Did she have anything big on?
-The interview with Beechum. . .

67
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,005
. . .at San Quentin,
then the execution tonight.

68
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,564
lt's worse for Michelle.

69
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,686
You think so, Bob?

70
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,848
lf the warden will okay
a replacement for the interview. . .

71
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,848
. . .l'll take Harvey out
of that meeting.

72
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,724
-Put Everett on it.
-Steve has the day off.

73
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,605
Not anymore. He can do the interview
and witness the execution.

74
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,446
And what's-his-name,
the warden at San Quentin. . . .

75
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,960
Steve's dealt with him before.
l can get him in.

76
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,081
-You think Everett's an asshole.
-l don't think that.

77
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,603
You're wrong. He is an asshole.
Trust me, l know him.

78
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,927
But a lot of people who are good
at their jobs are assholes.

79
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,122
l know that, Alan, all right?
lt's not about that.

80
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,688
Everything with Everett is a witch-hunt,
like that Mike Vargas piece.

81
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:45,846
He's not a drunk now.

82
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,281
Two months ago he's a drunk,
now he's Mother Teresa.

83
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,403
This is not a Steve Everett
slash-and-burn job.

84
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,204
This is a sidebar.
lt's an issue piece.

85
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,804
''An issue piece. ''
Well, dog my cats!

86
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,081
lt's capital punishment, Alan.

87
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,885
We are putting a man to death tonight.
We are killing a human being.

88
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,398
Stop the presses!

89
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,806
By the way,
that Amy what's-her-name. . .

90
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,923
. . .the pregnant broad
Frankie shot in the throat. . .

91
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,008
. . .was she a human being?
ls that part of the issue?

92
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,406
Yeah, that is part of the issue.

93
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,964
Let me tell you--
Cake?

94
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,320
lssues are shit we use
as an excuse to run good stories.

95
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,482
''Judge Grabs Female Attorney's Tits. ''
The sex discrimination ''issue. ''

96
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,761
''Nine-year-old Shoots
Brother With Uzi. ''

97
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,688
The child violence ''issue. ''

98
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,803
People want to read
about sex organs and blood.

99
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,159
You know what?

100
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,922
We make up issues so they don't have
to feel too nasty about it. Got it?

101
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,565
l should call Everett,
because that's his attitude.

102
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,808
A little sarcasm?
How long you been here? Three months?

103
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,445
l've worked with Everett
for three years.

104
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,846
And let me tell you something, Bob.

105
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,162
The guy is good, as good as anybody
l've ever worked with.

106
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,287
You know why
he was run out of New York?

107
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,559
l heard some things.

108
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,081
He busted the mayor.
The mayor of fucking New York City!

109
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,480
He found a secret memo on a bribe. . .

110
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,240
. . .between His Honor and an ex-borough
president and ran with it.

111
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,286
So?

112
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,687
The paper killed it because
the owner was in bed with the mayor.

113
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,005
What did Everett do?

114
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,359
He didn't whine. . .

115
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,242
. . .and he didn't back down.

116
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,566
He just fucking walked.

117
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,922
That's Steve Everett.

118
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,645
-Fine.
-Good.

119
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,443
-How's the quitting smoking?
-Great.

120
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,359
When you send the flowers
to that dead girl. . .

121
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,844
. . .Michelle's family. . .

122
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,805
. . .would you include my name?
Thanks.

123
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,723
-See you.
-All right.

124
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,800
The mayor of New York City, Bob.

125
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,240
The mayor, you gullible asshole.

126
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,283
Yeah, l could have stayed
in New York forever.

127
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,562
They were about to put me
in charge of an investigative team.

128
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,080
That would have put me
on the Pulitzer track.

129
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,999
l really liked it there.
Broadway shows, downtown jazz clubs. . .

130
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,923
. . .dinners at Elaine's,
veal chops up the old wazoo.

131
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,481
Not veal chops like that, though.

132
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,089
Jaws!

133
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,644
Now you have to kiss it
and make it better.

134
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,599
So you were the king of New York.

135
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,007
Why are you hacking out metro stories
at the Oakland Tribune ?

136
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,522
Well, that's a long story.

137
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,166
l got caught in the supply room
with a very young lady.

138
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,040
Turned out to be the owner's daughter.

139
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,328
How the hell was l supposed to know
she was underage?

140
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,561
She looked 1 8 to me.

141
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,360
Anyway, l got blackballed
all over town.

142
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,323
You bad man!
What did your wife say?

143
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,483
We'd just had the kid,
so she took it kind of hard.

144
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,120
But Alan offered us
this gig out here.

145
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,889
Another town, another change.

146
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,569
Bad man!

147
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,845
First the owner's daughter,
now the editor's wife.

148
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,762
Do l detect a little. . .

149
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,447
. . .hostility towards authority figures?

150
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,728
Only ones l work for.

151
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,161
ls that what you'll say
in the next town with someone else?

152
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,203
''l got caught with the editor's wife.
You know. ''

153
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,567
l get caught
with the editor's wife. . .

154
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,364
. . .there's not many more towns
that'll have me.

155
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,963
So playtime's over?

156
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,687
You've got to go to work.
l've got to get home. . .

157
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,484
. . .see if the wife and kid
still recognize me.

158
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,599
You won't tell me how awful we are,
will you?

159
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,767
Bob, he's a decent sort.

160
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,719
Good newspaperman, solid editor.

161
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,278
So this all just stinks. . .

162
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,320
. . .right?

163
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,079
What we're doing?

164
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,598
Patricia. . .

165
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,963
. . .you and l are just two people
swimming through the passions of life.

166
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,520
You know?

167
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,883
Look, it's all right.

168
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,206
lt's not like l love you or anything.

169
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,166
That's good.

170
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,923
Because l don't love you too.

171
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,286
All right.

172
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,523
Yes, all right.

173
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,808
You won't believe this.

174
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,080
What?

175
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,484
That was Bob.

176
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,320
What'd he want?

177
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,839
He was looking for you.

178
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,686
Who told him?

179
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,084
How should l know?

180
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,644
Morning, Frank.

181
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,204
Mr. Plunkitt.

182
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,443
Anything l can get for you?

183
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,209
Anything you need?

184
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,640
No, not anything l can think of.

185
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,483
There's some matters
l gotta discuss with you.

186
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,609
Figured we'd do it first,
get it out of the way.

187
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,088
Your dinner tonight,
for one thing. . .

188
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,846
. . .can be pretty much
anything you want.

189
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,443
You go ahead and tell Reedy here
when you decide.

190
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,522
Now, about your personal effects--

191
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,243
My wife will take them.

192
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,929
And your remains?

193
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,168
That go for your remains too?

194
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,088
lf she can't afford the funeral--

195
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,010
Our church raised some money.
lt's all right.

196
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,330
So your wife will be claiming
your remains?

197
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,208
Yes, sir, that's right.

198
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,365
l want to give you some idea
of what's going to happen tonight.

199
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,683
We'll have to ask your visitors
to leave at 7 p.m.

200
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,602
You'll be given your dinner
and a fresh set of clothes.

201
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,839
We'll come for you about a half-hour
before the procedure.

202
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,400
You'll be taken
into the procedure room.

203
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,762
They'll hook an EKG up to you
and the intravenous lines.

204
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,604
But nothing's going to happen
early or anything.

205
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,360
Right up until 1 2:01 ,
we'll be monitoring the phones.

206
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,570
We got lines to the attorney
general and the governor.

207
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,447
And those we check to make sure
they're working.

208
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,960
You have any questions?

209
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,125
No.

210
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,889
Just one more thing,
and then l'll leave you in peace.

211
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,925
-lt's about the sedative.
-l don't want one.

212
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:06,644
Sedative's completely optional, Frank.

213
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,525
lt can make things a lot easier.

214
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,845
l don't want it.

215
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,127
l appreciate it, Mr. Plunkitt. . .

216
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,725
. . .but l want to be clear in my mind.

217
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,483
When l see my wife,
l want to be clear for that.

218
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,324
Fair enough.

219
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,085
You change your mind,
let the officer know.

220
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,201
l just had to give you my sales talk.

221
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,364
Badges will be at the gate.
Got the witness list.

222
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,639
What else?

223
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:51,479
Roadblocks are up.
Demonstrators are light so far.

224
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,761
-Visitors squared away?
-Wife and kid.

225
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,360
Your girl from the Trib,
Michelle Ziegler, will be here at 4.

226
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,129
Mea culpa.

227
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,563
-She was pretty persuasive.
-Let her persuade me next time.

228
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,207
Arnie, what do you think of Beechum?

229
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:11,000
Sometimes l think about the girl
he shot dead over $96.

230
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,599
Mostly l think about doing my job.

231
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,564
Warden! Sir!

232
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,080
l repent!

233
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,328
Jesus, Atkins!

234
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,367
Give me some of that pussy, baby.

235
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,325
Give me some pussy on toast!
l need some of that pussy on toast!

236
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,760
Go ahead, baby, shake that thing.

237
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,520
Excuse me.
Can l have some pussy on toast?

238
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,439
l just need some pussy on toast.
Give me some pussy on toast!

239
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,165
-ls that you, newspaperman?
-Back off.

240
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,247
You got money.
Give me some on toast.

241
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,568
Come on, l need it.

242
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,083
Promise me you will not
spend this on food.

243
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,440
Five dollars?

244
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,482
You can give me more than that.

245
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,568
Give me five, give me 1 0.
Come on, give me 20, Steve.

246
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,363
Give me $1 00,
you got so much money!

247
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,483
You got money on toast, baby!
l know you do.

248
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,238
-Hey, sister!
-Get away from me.

249
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:32,681
-l know you got some sweet pussy!
-Get away from me.

250
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,406
You nasty motherfucker!
Shut your nasty ass up.

251
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,488
l want something on the toast.
Nothing wrong with that.

252
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,728
Put some on the toast for me.
l know she likes me.

253
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,044
l know l'm going to give her
my phone number.

254
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,443
Hello, everyone.

255
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,439
You got my message?

256
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,239
Apparently, you and l
have a little problem.

257
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:08,886
Do we?

258
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,365
Yes, we do.

259
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,118
Look, Bob--

260
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,123
Michelle Ziegler was killed
in a car wreck last night.

261
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,159
What?

262
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,639
Michelle?

263
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,928
That couldn't be.
l was with her last night.

264
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,408
Oh, no!

265
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,806
She was only 23 or something.

266
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,088
Dead Man's Curve.

267
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,603
My God!

268
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,483
The poor kid!

269
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,440
Just out of school
and 23 or something.

270
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,402
l should have driven her home.

271
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,921
She had an interview set up
with Frank Beechum this afternoon.

272
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,959
The poor. . . .

273
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,478
Beechum.

274
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:57,527
Yeah, l heard they were going
to juice him today.

275
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,040
ln fact, she said she had a seat
for the show.

276
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,205
Four o'clock in the deathwatch cell.
Alan wants you to cover for her.

277
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,318
ls he the one who killed
that pregnant girl?

278
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:14,646
College student, Amy Wilson.
Working the summer in Richmond.

279
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,683
Place called Pocum's Grocery.
Owed Beechum 96 bucks.

280
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,962
Repairs he did on her car
or something. Shot her dead.

281
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,849
Anything else l should know?

282
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,127
Tough, black mechanic
at the Amoco station in Clayton.

283
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,089
But l warn you, do not pull
a Dick Tracy on this.

284
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,008
l don't want a big investigation.

285
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,080
You can depend on that.
Don't worry.

286
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,203
Says here, Beechum's
one of those born-agains.

287
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,526
Yeah, aren't they all on death row?

288
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,523
Biggest birthrate in the country.

289
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,209
Cynical.

290
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,642
He came from Michigan.
Broken home, alcoholic mother.

291
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:56,085
He's been in and out ofjails,
violent assaults, drugs.

292
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,001
He did two years for beating a cop
who tried to give him a ticket.

293
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,803
Sounds like a reasonable fella.

294
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,240
Then another three for breaking
into a store.

295
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,844
Then he got out, met his wife.
Nice girl, born-again.

296
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,324
Led him to Jesus.

297
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,884
They had a daughter,
bought a house in Richmond.

298
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,400
Yeah, now he's Mr. Nice Guy.

299
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,762
l guess not. Six years ago,
he walks into Pocum's. . .

300
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,603
...Amy Wilson 's on the register.

301
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,084
Let me guess.

302
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,847
He asks Amy for his $96
and she says she doesn 't have it.

303
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,604
And old Frank,
he gets his wicked temper up.

304
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:32,839
l don't suppose he's expressed
any heartfelt remorse?

305
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,489
Nope. Get this.

306
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,729
He still says that he just went
to the store for some A-1 Steak Sauce.

307
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,363
Steak sauce?

308
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,005
Well, that's a nice touch.

309
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,881
Nussbaum had two strong witnesses.

310
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,325
Black or white?

311
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,601
Let's see. Both white.

312
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,358
A woman in the parking lot
saw him run away. . .

313
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,201
. . .and this poor guy, an accountant. . .

314
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,163
. . .goes in to use the phone
because his car overheated.

315
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,964
Beechum is there,
gun in hand, blood all over him.

316
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,208
All l'm looking for
is the human-interest angle.

317
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,321
Final days, what it's like.

318
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,885
-Got it?
-Yeah, l got it.

319
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,368
Anything else you need from me?

320
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,165
Nope.

321
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,002
Good. Okey-dokey.

322
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,243
Get right on it.

323
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,921
Something else on your mind, Steve?

324
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,923
The witness. . .

325
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,924
. . .the one who found Beechum
with the body. . .

326
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,802
. . .must have heard the shots.

327
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,528
The shots.

328
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,123
You know, he comes in. . .

329
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,004
. . .his car's overheated,
he's got the hood up.

330
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:50,009
Must be working on it.
Meanwhile, a robbery's going on.

331
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,129
He had to have heard shots.

332
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,729
So he heard the shots.

333
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,405
But this is a white accountant
in Richmond.

334
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:02,088
You're telling me he's going to walk
into a store when he heard shots?

335
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:05,487
You know what? l don't know
if he heard the shots.

336
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,601
Maybe he did. l don't care.

337
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,168
What l'd like you to do is interview
Beechum about his feelings today.

338
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,203
Turn it into a human-interest sidebar.
Can you do that?

339
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,800
Yeah, l'll get right on it.

340
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,320
No problem.

341
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,324
Bye-bye.

342
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,599
Fuck!

343
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,040
Close one!

344
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,480
l don't know what you did,
but he's after you.

345
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,725
We're about two seconds away
from a full Bob Findley explosion.

346
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,678
What are you, crazy?

347
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,089
You're lighting up after
Bob's ''no smoking'' speech?

348
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,198
l missed that.

349
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,401
Yeah. That was smart too.

350
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,402
Try to be a good boy, okay?

351
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:27,886
Beechum case.

352
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:32,644
Victim: Amy Wilson, married,
20 years old, shot in the chest...

353
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:36,639
... with a .38 as she stood behind
the counter at Pocum 's Grocery.

354
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,843
Six months pregnant at the time.
Both she and the baby died.

355
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,040
Two witnesses.

356
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,682
First witness:
Nancy Larson, housewife...

357
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,609
...mother of three.
Drives into Pocum 's parking lot.

358
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,723
Larson couldn 't see
whether he had a gun or not.

359
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,204
No weapon was found.

360
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,925
Later she picked Beechum out
of a police lineup...

361
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,599
... the same lineup
where he was picked out...

362
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,120
...by Dale Porterhouse, CPA.
He was in the area.

363
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,720
His car overheated,
so he drove into Pocum 's.

364
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:08,446
Porterhouse picks Beechum
from the lineup that same day.

365
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,528
Records show Amy Wilson
owed Beechum $96...

366
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,163
...for carburetor work.

367
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,849
Note for future essay:

368
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,644
Why so few female car mechanics?

369
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,006
Want coffee, Ev?

370
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,089
lt's back in fashion
as a late-morning pick-me-up.

371
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,125
Make it a big one.

372
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,202
Women can fetch coffee now. . .

373
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,958
. . .because job opportunities
give us new confidence.

374
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,761
Do you think being
the trends editor's getting to you?

375
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,599
l don't know.
Was l an insane person before?

376
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,403
You're a great person.

377
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,405
You take it black?

378
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:56,839
l do.

379
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,724
Shit!

380
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:16,125
Steve, thank God. Where are you?

381
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,119
l'm at the paper. They roped me in.

382
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,322
Did they call you at the gym?
They tried here.

383
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,408
l stopped by to pick something up
and they grabbed me.

384
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,408
Did you have a good workout?

385
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,449
Yeah, decent.

386
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,518
Good. Anyway, you promised Kate
you'd take her to the zoo.

387
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:35,919
The zoo!

388
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,718
God, l forgot!

389
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,439
Steve, she really is expecting you.

390
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,723
l'm sorry about that.
l really just forgot.

391
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,444
You worked all weekend.
She didn 't see you at all.

392
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,085
You know how she loves her daddy.

393
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,278
l know it's work...

394
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:57,449
...but l feel it would be
a bad idea to let her down again.

395
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,926
Barbara, there's been an accident.

396
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:03,088
Remember Michelle Ziegler?
You met at Christmas?

397
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,720
She piled up her car
on Dead Man's Curve.

398
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,320
That's terrible. There's been
so many accidents there.

399
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,328
They ought to do something.

400
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,406
-What was that?
-They ought do something about that.

401
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,887
-ls she hurt?
-''Not if l heard anything like that. ''

402
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,005
Yeah, dead.

403
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,640
That's awful.
You're filling in for her?

404
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,801
They've got a ticket
for the execution tonight.

405
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:33,328
Don 't tell me they couldn 't get
someone else. You worked all weekend.

406
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,440
Finally!

407
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,204
What? Where are you?

408
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:42,203
Barbara, look, l don't have
to be at San Quentin till 4.

409
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,403
Why don't l pick up Katie, take her
to the zoo and bring her back at 3?

410
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,520
Coffee time!

411
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,404
What about her nap?
She has her nap after lunch.

412
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,646
Her nap?

413
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,249
lsn't today your day off?

414
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,686
She gets cranky without her nap.

415
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:58,438
Well, l'll bring her a double espresso.

416
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:02,003
-lt's just a joke.
-l'm busting a gut.

417
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,248
l'll be there in a half-hour,
1 2:30 at the latest.

418
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,926
Why'd you go in there
on your day off?

419
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,407
Are you still trying to make up
for that Mike Vargas thing?

420
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,244
l'll be there at 1 2:30, all right?

421
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:21,809
More and more workers insist on the
right not to breathe secondhand smoke.

422
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,766
And more and more scumbags don't care.

423
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,764
Well, Bridget,
you're an adorable person.

424
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,442
Sexual harassment.

425
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,809
What are the guidelines?

426
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,048
Who can say?

427
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,043
l hate my job, Ev.

428
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,527
But l love watching you do it.

429
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,802
Don't look now.

430
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:55,368
Gosh, Mr. Reporter, is that what
real newspapermen get to read?

431
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,607
Well, Dale Porterhouse:

432
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,967
''No, l couldn't have heard the shots.

433
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,721
The windows were rolled up and l had
the radio and air conditioner on.

434
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,319
That's probably why
the car overheated. ''

435
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,319
Close quote.

436
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:12,602
That's another wild hunch
down the drain.

437
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,768
My condolences.

438
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,404
No great loss.

439
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,402
Look, anybody calls. . .

440
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,489
. . .l'm at the zoo.

441
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,964
Me too.

442
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,169
Good morning, Frank.

443
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,602
l thought maybe. . .

444
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,486
. . .if there's anything
l can do for you. . .

445
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,965
. . .anything you'd like
to talk about. . .

446
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,764
. . .l want you to know l'm here,
l'm available.

447
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,762
l understand
you read the Bible.

448
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,881
That's right, isn't it, Frank?

449
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,964
But, you know. . .

450
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:21,528
. . .just reading the Bible
isn't enough, is it?

451
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,879
No.

452
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:27,689
Man can't go to his Maker with
the sins of his soul unrepented of.

453
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,569
With the hurt he's caused
folks just, you know. . .

454
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,563
. . .unrepented of.

455
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,725
A lot of folks would feel
better to hear. . .

456
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,888
. . .you were remorseful
for the pain you caused them.

457
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,320
You could do a lot of good
with those words.

458
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,647
l don't have anything to tell you.

459
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,525
Reverend Shillerman. . .

460
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:02,922
. . .l want you to leave.
l have my own pastor coming later.

461
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,489
l don't need to tell you. . .

462
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:18,205
. . .there will come a time,
and l'm afraid it's not far off. . .

463
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:19,766
Reedy!

464
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,405
. . .when you'll wish you'd made
a different decision.

465
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,839
But it will be too late.

466
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:28,999
What can l get you?

467
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,248
Get this damn fool out of my face!

468
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,804
Call himself a man of God.

469
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,200
Reverend Shillerman!

470
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,007
Reverend Shit-For-Brains.

471
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,209
Now, Frank. . .

472
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,045
. . .l wouldn't want to
be strapped to that table. . .

473
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,725
. . .with the wrongs
l've committed unrepented of.

474
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,080
When they stick that needle
in your arm. . .

475
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,609
. . .feel your blood run to ice!

476
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:53,959
Reverend, that's enough!

477
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,322
Get him out of here!

478
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,329
l feel sorry for you, Frank.

479
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,528
l'm sorry too. Believe me.

480
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,766
l mean it.
We don't want no trouble.

481
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,359
All right.
l just felt it's my job.

482
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,208
lt might be upsetting. . . .

483
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,569
Everyone wants in on the action,
right, Frank?

484
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,123
Twelve hours from now,
convicted killer Frank Beechum...

485
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,878
... will be executed
by lethal injection.

486
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:48,888
He was convicted six years ago...

487
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:53,561
...of the brutal slaying of 20-year-old
Amy Wilson and her unborn child...

488
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:57,206
...at Pocum 's Grocery in the
Richmond section of the county.

489
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,526
Wilson, who was six months pregnant...

490
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,165
... was working
when Beechum shot her...

491
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,999
...during an argument over $96
she owed him and was unable to pay.

492
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,725
Now the weather:

493
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:12,683
Morning low clouds
with some afternoon clearing.

494
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,804
Help you?

495
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,558
Yeah, l'm a reporter
from the Oakland Tribune.

496
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,080
lsn't this where
Amy Wilson was killed?

497
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,769
lt sure is.

498
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,769
She was right behind
this same counter.

499
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,689
Almost six years ago exactly.

500
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,079
Mr. Pocum says. . .

501
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,962
. . .the needle's too good for him.

502
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,649
For Beechum.

503
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,490
They ought to bring back the chair.
That's what l say.

504
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,204
Really let him have
a jolt of something.

505
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,559
What's back there?

506
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,080
Bathroom.

507
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,644
Mr. Pocum was always nice. . .

508
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,922
. . .about letting folks come in
and do their business.

509
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:24,361
l'll come back some other time maybe
and do some really serious shopping.

510
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,801
Am l going to be in the newspaper?

511
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,084
Was something here before?

512
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,486
That's where
the potato chips used to be.

513
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:34,079
But Mr. Pocum moved
the rack over here. . .

514
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,122
. . .so it'd be what you call. . .

515
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,049
. . .an impulse kind of purchase.

516
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,401
This in that story you're writing?

517
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,488
That's a good point.

518
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:47,807
l'm writing a human-interest sidebar.
Do you know what that is?

519
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,564
No, l don't think l do.

520
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,727
l don't think l do either.

521
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,323
Sorry, l got hung up.

522
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,405
Daddy!

523
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,521
Aren't we going to the zoo today?

524
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:19,485
Well, what's holding us up?
Don't you want to get dressed?

525
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:23,160
-Let's change your clothes.
-What animal do you want to see?

526
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,725
Daddy, l want to go see
the hippopotamus.

527
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,762
Come on, let's change your pants.

528
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:35,410
l tell you,
looking into those eyes...

529
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,009
...l don 't think....

530
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:42,441
lt was like looking into the eyes
of a goat. Something like that.

531
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,967
They were that cold.

532
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:48,846
l can 't honestly say that
l've ever wished anyone dead.

533
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:52,964
But l think l'll feel a lot safer
when Frank Beechum 's gone.

534
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:57,598
That's Dale Porterhouse, an accountant
with the firm of Stokes and Whitney.

535
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:02,247
Porterhouse was the state's key witness
in the Wilson case six years ago...

536
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:06,045
...a case that will culminate
at one minute past midnight...

537
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:10,209
... with the execution by lethal
injection of Frank Beechum.

538
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,128
lnformation. What city, please?

539
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:16,528
Oakland, for a Stokes and Whitney.
lt's an accounting firm.

540
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,528
The number you requested is....

541
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,607
Come on, let's go. Daddy's here.

542
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,005
Steve, what is it?

543
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,201
Just a hunch l've got.
Bear with me.

544
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:26,845
Tonight, finally, is the execution.

545
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:30,839
lt's been a long six years. Do you
feeljustice is finally being done?

546
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,086
ls Dale Porterhouse there, please?

547
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:36,407
-Mr. Porterhouse is at lunch.
-Get off the phone, Daddy.

548
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,608
Right now!

549
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:45,088
This is Steve Everett. l'm a reporter
with the Oakland Tribune.

550
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:48,203
Could you have him call me?
lt's about the Beechum case.

551
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:51,527
Nothing will end that rage
except the death of the monster...

552
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,529
... who killed my daughter
and my unborn grandchild.

553
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,369
l'll give you my beeper number.

554
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,683
You're not taking that beeper!

555
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:02,167
Just a second, it's just a hunch.
No big deal.

556
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,362
Yeah, it's 5-5-5. . .

557
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,243
. . . 1 -4-3-9.

558
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,248
-l'll make sure he gets it.
-Thanks.

559
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,599
Okay, sweetheart, what do you think?

560
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,808
Are you ready for the big hippo?

561
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,846
You want to go in the den with Dad?

562
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:22,406
l'll show you something
Dad's got to take with him.

563
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,850
Not the beeper.
Right? Not the beeper.

564
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:29,566
Let's pick up my beeper.
This goes ''beep, beep, beep. ''

565
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:34,560
Yeah, it goes ''beep, beep, beep. ''

566
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,845
Come on, get your jacket on.

567
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:41,964
And now we're just hours away
from the actual time of execution.

568
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,639
Daddy, l want to go see
the hippopotamus.

569
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:47,398
After a break,
we'll be talking to someone...

570
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:50,409
... who thinks capital punishment
is never the solution.

571
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,362
l love you!

572
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,562
Bye, Katie!

573
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,640
Have a good time! l love you.

574
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:00,648
l love you too, Mama.

575
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,438
Wait!

576
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,525
The car seat!

577
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,207
Mother, l'm too big for a car seat.

578
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,162
We'll put her in back.
How's that?

579
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,681
Put her in the back seat.
Seat belt!

580
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,839
Don't forget the seat belt!

581
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,518
The seat belt, Steven!

582
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,283
lt's fine. lt's fine.

583
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,367
l should've never
stopped by that store.

584
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:27,679
Oh, God!

585
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:37,358
Dale Porterhouse, please. This is
Steve Everett of the Tribune.

586
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,408
Be with you
in just a second, darling.

587
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:44,409
This is Dale Porterhouse.
What can l do for you?

588
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,522
l'll be ready in a second, darling.
We'll go in a second.

589
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,608
Mr. Porterhouse, this is Steve Everett
of the Tribune.

590
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:55,041
l'm covering the Beechum
execution tonight.

591
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:59,880
l thought you were one of
the chief witnesses in that.

592
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,609
Just a second.
Just a second, sweetheart.

593
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:07,967
l was wondering if l could have
1 0 minutes with you.

594
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,718
l'd be glad to.
l can 't talk right now.

595
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,363
l could meet you later.

596
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,400
Yeah, where?

597
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:17,604
How about we meet at the
Bread Company restaurant? Know it?

598
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,642
Yeah, l know it exactly.

599
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,162
On Ninth Street, isn't it?

600
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:26,007
-How about we meet in a half-hour?
-Half-hour it'll be.

601
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,443
Thanks. Bye.

602
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:29,886
Okay, baby.

603
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,728
Come here. Come on.

604
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,040
But l'm too big to sit in a stroller!

605
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:38,885
That's nonsense. We're going
to play this game called Speed Zoo.

606
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,808
Speed Zoo?

607
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,089
Monkeys!

608
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,684
-Giraffes!
-We go fast.

609
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:58,805
Birdies!

610
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,239
Speed Zoo!

611
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:02,885
Camel lips!

612
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,089
We go fast.

613
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,929
We go fast!

614
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,166
Where's the hippopotamus?

615
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,566
Elephants! Look at the elephants.

616
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,842
Where's the hippopotamus?

617
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,483
Speed Zoo!

618
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,046
l want to see the hippopotamus!

619
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,729
We go fast.

620
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,648
l want a hippopotamus!

621
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:42,567
l'm sorry. l wouldn't have
this happen for the world.

622
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,559
l want my mommy!

623
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,568
l know, sweetie.

624
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:49,839
Daddy's sorry.

625
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,564
Oh, my God! What happened to you?

626
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:59,643
She's a real trooper,
l've got to tell you.

627
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,888
What the hell's wrong with you?

628
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,603
How you holding up?

629
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,404
Like l said, there's always a chance.

630
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,960
But with all the feeling
about the girl. . . .

631
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,562
You know how the governor's
tough on crime.

632
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,560
So Mr. Berris says that maybe. . .

633
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,365
. . .if you just tell him
about how remorseful you feel. . . .

634
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,129
You know what l'm saying?

635
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:26,086
-l didn't do it.
-l understand.

636
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:29,919
l'm just telling you that's what
we're facing here, all right?

637
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,644
l can't say l'm sorry
for what l never did.

638
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,763
l'll call you as soon as
the appeal comes down.

639
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,005
Hi, Daddy.

640
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,850
l brought you a picture,
but it's not done. . .

641
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:45,086
. . .so l have to finish it, okay?

642
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,841
Hold on.
They're going to let me in.

643
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,327
Don't be sad now.
We're not going to be afraid.

644
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,643
Give Daddy a big hug, please?

645
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:06,729
Come on, don't be sad. Don't be afraid.
We're not gonna be afraid.

646
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,401
l'm gonna finish my picture now,
Daddy, okay?

647
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:14,678
You do Daddy a favor, okay?
Now, walk over here with me, okay?

648
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:23,568
l want you to sit right here while
l have a little talk with Mommy, okay?

649
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,123
Give me a kiss.

650
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:35,169
Come on.

651
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,440
Come on, now.

652
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:41,761
You know l'm just going home
to dreamland, that's all.

653
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:48,007
lt's green pastures, Daddy. See?

654
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:51,202
Here's the blue sky.
l made it at the motel.

655
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:55,160
Gonna be holding two places
at the table for us.

656
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,325
We're not gonna cry.

657
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,168
l'm sorry. Okay.

658
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,960
We know l'm going to a better place
beyond this place, right?

659
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,839
The thing l worry about most
in all this. . . .

660
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,000
No, she loves you.

661
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,366
She loves you.

662
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:25,084
l don't want her
to ever think her daddy did--

663
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,008
She won't think that.

664
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,368
She knows you.

665
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:32,722
l can't find green, Mama.
Do you have it?

666
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:37,847
All the crayons are
in the box, honey.

667
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,088
Well, l can't find it.

668
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,205
Don't you ever let her think it.

669
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,438
You do that for me, okay?

670
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:47,998
l swear.

671
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:49,806
lt's lost.

672
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:51,842
l can't find it anywhere.

673
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,765
Can you use another color, honey?

674
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,281
l have to have green.

675
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,640
lt's green pastures!

676
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,285
Look for it.
lt's got to be here somewhere.

677
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:05,765
Daddy won't mind
if you use another color.

678
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:09,443
Okay, baby.

679
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,883
Calm down.

680
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:14,008
Calm down, honey.

681
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:17,120
Mrs. Beechum?

682
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:21,206
What parking area did you use?

683
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:40,043
Yeah, just a moment.

684
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,042
lt's your lawyer again.

685
00:44:58,130 --> 00:44:59,199
We lost it.

686
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,239
l'm sorry.

687
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:06,202
Mr. Berris will be at the
governor's late this afternoon.

688
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:11,004
We got to be honest
about what's going on.

689
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:12,599
Know what l'm saying?

690
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:19,481
l'm really sorry, Frank.

691
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:23,841
We tried, but you know,
itjust didn 't work.

692
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:27,841
l don 't know what else to say.
l'm so sorry.

693
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:30,329
God bless you, Frank.

694
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:40,126
-So is there anything?
-No, nothing yet.

695
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:43,482
You know how these legal things are.
They take forever.

696
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:50,640
Control, we've located the material.

697
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:56,198
Copy that.

698
00:45:57,610 --> 00:45:58,360
Good news.

699
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:02,126
They found the crayon.
lt'll be here soon.

700
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:06,443
You hear that, sweetie?

701
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:10,086
Now you can show Daddy
some real pastures.

702
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:15,006
-Green pastures.
-That's right. Baby's green pastures.

703
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:16,439
Come here.

704
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:22,602
Your green is coming.

705
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:24,687
Told you they would find it.

706
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:34,881
l believe there's such a thing
in this world as good citizenship.

707
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:39,049
A man sees an injustice, let alone
a cold-blooded murder, he has--

708
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:42,203
Let me get this straight.
You didn't see the murder.

709
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:45,050
Of course not.
l never said l did.

710
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,519
Well, what did you see?

711
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:49,449
Mr. Everett, l've been
through this so many times.

712
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:53,609
-l can't tell you how many--
-l have trouble getting it into my head.

713
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,084
lt's simple.

714
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:57,845
l went into Pocum's to use the phone.

715
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:00,008
My car had overheated.

716
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:04,203
When the door slammed behind me,
he jumped up from behind the counter.

717
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,407
He was covered with blood
and had a gun.

718
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:09,359
l guess it was when
he was bending over Amy. . .

719
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:12,762
...l mean, Mrs. Wilson,
stealing her ring and her necklace.

720
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:16,480
He got one good look at me,
then ran out the service entrance.

721
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:21,127
My concern is for the girl,
so l immediately dial 91 1.

722
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,080
l figured...

723
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:26,884
... why should l run after a killer
who 's got a gun...

724
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:29,121
. . .when l can let
the police do their job?

725
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:30,684
And they sure did it.

726
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:32,602
Yeah, they sure did.

727
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:35,484
We live in a country
where there's a rule of law.

728
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,842
l mean, an ordinary citizen
who does--

729
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:41,963
Aren't you going to take notes
or use a tape recorder?

730
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,922
Usually when l talk to reporters. . .

731
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:47,008
. . .they want to keep a record
of what l say.

732
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,686
l've got a photographic memory.

733
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:51,609
ls that some kind of joke?

734
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:56,001
No, l have a notebook right here.

735
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:59,163
Just having an off day.
You'll have to excuse me.

736
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:02,806
Slow day.

737
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:04,638
Yeah, well. . . .

738
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:09,721
-My point simply was this: A man--
-Mr. Porterhouse. . .

739
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,847
. . .let me cut to the chase.

740
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,529
Are you absolutely sure
about your testimony?

741
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:18,368
Absolutely. Why wouldn't l be?

742
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:22,240
You saw Frank Beechum's face
and the gun?

743
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:27,558
lf l had doubts about my testimony,
l would've told the police.

744
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:32,165
That must have been scary, having him
point that gun right at you.

745
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:35,010
No. Thank God, no.
lt wasn't like that.

746
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:36,445
Was it above his head?

747
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:40,643
No, he had the gun down
by his side in a very normal way.

748
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:44,769
How could you have seen
over the potato chips?

749
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:46,245
What?

750
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:50,928
What potato chips?

751
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:53,041
l had a perfectly clear view.

752
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:57,165
Look, right here. Here's where
you come in the main entrance.

753
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:01,000
You look across and see Beechum
going out the service entrance.

754
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:05,325
Here in the center
is a rack of potato chips.

755
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:08,603
l don 't know how
you could have seen a gun there...

756
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:11,040
. . .unless he was waving it
over his head.

757
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:14,406
Why would l say
l saw a gun if l didn't?

758
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:15,799
l don't know.

759
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:17,887
Maybe you like telling the story. . .

760
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:21,924
. . .telling the police or reporters
something they didn't already have.

761
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:26,244
Maybe you like telling the girls
around the office coffee machine.

762
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,840
This is absolutely absurd.

763
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:35,679
You actually think that
l would jeopardize a man's life. . .

764
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:38,723
. . .in order to impress the girls
around my office?

765
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:42,009
l don't know, Mr. Porterhouse.
We only just met.

766
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:46,000
That's right, Mr. Everett.
We only just met.

767
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,999
But l did some checking on you
before l returned your call.

768
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:53,999
You led that crusade to get the rapist
released last year, didn't you?

769
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:57,521
That lying what's-his-name?

770
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:01,323
You wouldn't be referring
to the Mike Vargas case?

771
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:05,048
Had all your facts straight
on that one too, didn't you?

772
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:09,518
Then they threatened him with
the DNA test. The guy confesses.

773
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:14,002
l'm surprised
they didn't fire you on the spot.

774
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:16,163
So am l.

775
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:21,485
Look, l'm sorry.

776
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:23,369
l just thought. . . .

777
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:26,682
l don't know what l thought.

778
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,361
Can l tell you about our specials?

779
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:42,479
All right, lunch is here
and the drinks are cold.

780
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:43,919
Who gets the roast beef?

781
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:45,929
Over here, Zach.

782
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:47,040
Here you go.

783
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:51,564
Seems like there's more fat
and less meat every time l get this.

784
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:55,286
Ain't that the way you order it?
Hold the meat, leave the fat?

785
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:58,607
Arnold's all right.
The more of him, the better.

786
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:04,888
What do you say we do some work
while we feed our faces?

787
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,327
You all know that at 1 800 hours. . .

788
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:10,443
. . .the whole staff meets here
for a final briefing.

789
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:12,523
Excuse me, Warden.

790
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:18,806
The reverend here will hold a prayer
meeting after the briefing.

791
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:24,883
Which is optional for anyone
who wants to stay.

792
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:30,808
Also be advised. . .

793
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:34,204
. . .there's a change
in the 1 600 interview thing.

794
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:37,126
The girl had some kind of accident.

795
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,882
They've replaced her with Everett.

796
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:44,159
Damn!

797
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:48,080
l realize his butt ain't quite
up to the standard of Michelle's. . .

798
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,402
. . .but that's who's coming anyway.

799
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:57,608
Everyone clear on that?

800
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,203
Well, speak of the devil!

801
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:33,321
Alan tells me l'm paying you too much.

802
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:37,239
You can rest assured l'm frittering
it away on women and booze.

803
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:41,450
You're a real dyed-in-the-wool
son of a bitch.

804
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,129
Anybody ever tell you that?

805
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:45,123
Just close friends and family.

806
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:49,362
-l'll come back later.
-No, l was just leaving.

807
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:52,760
Still sober as a judge, right?

808
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:56,645
Guess you haven't been partying with
the Alameda County judges lately.

809
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:00,044
Yeah, sober as an ex-drunk, sir.

810
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:02,802
Good to see you, Steve.

811
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,519
Stop fucking Bob's wife.
He doesn't like it.

812
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:12,562
What'd he do,
put it in the newspaper?

813
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:15,967
lf he comes to me and wants your ass,
l have to give it to him.

814
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,400
You'll just be a hole
with no ass around it.

815
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:22,080
You know what, Ev?
You're a fucking womanizer, that's what.

816
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:24,202
You'll fuck up
your career and marriage.

817
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:27,886
lf you can't keep your prick
in your pants, l can't protect you!

818
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,046
How was she?

819
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:32,720
None of your damn business.
Not bad.

820
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,765
Lucky! l always liked
and respected her.

821
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,405
Did l ever tell you about
the D.A. l was banging?

822
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:43,002
No, and if you do, l'll rip
your throat out with my bare hands.

823
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:45,520
l'll save it for another day.
Edifying story.

824
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:49,280
-l've got this problem.
-The nickel finally drops!

825
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:50,559
You do have a problem.

826
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:53,967
l told you Bob's been gunning
for you since the day he got here.

827
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:56,679
ln his quiet, earnest, reasonable way.

828
00:53:56,970 --> 00:54:00,406
He's glad you banged his wife.
Now he has a mandate to destroy you.

829
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:03,409
l live to make him happy.
That's not the problem.

830
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,442
Fuck my wife.
l'd just punch you.

831
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:06,446
l did.

832
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:07,719
Was she good?

833
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,966
A wildcat.
But that's not the problem.

834
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,569
What is it? Tell Papa.

835
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:14,887
Come to Papa, you soulless
sack of shit. What is it?

836
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:17,680
lt's Frank Beechum.

837
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:21,921
l think he may be innocent.

838
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:28,928
After the briefing,
Arnold will check the phones. . .

839
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:30,962
. . .make sure the lines are working.

840
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:33,366
Don't want the governor
to get a busy signal.

841
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:36,801
Don't worry. l got
call waiting put on that line.

842
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:38,045
Christ, Atkins!

843
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:40,924
Reuben, make sure the clocks
are synchronized.

844
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:43,405
And the one in the press room too.

845
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:45,329
You've got the strap-down team.

846
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:47,840
l myself had
a personal heart-to-heart. . .

847
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:50,769
. . .with the prisoner myself
this morning.

848
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:54,247
And going by my experience with the men,
he won't be any trouble.

849
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:55,758
ln my opinion.

850
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:09,118
All right.

851
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:12,367
What have you got on Beechum?

852
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:22,721
-Listen to me--
-l don't have to listen!

853
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:24,887
l'm looking at you. l'm looking and. . .

854
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:28,719
. . .l can see a reporter who's
about to tell me he has a hunch!

855
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:30,489
l've been checking some things.

856
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,840
You know my opinion
of reporters with hunches?

857
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:36,361
This witness said he saw a gun.
l don't think he did.

858
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:39,084
l can't fart loud enough
to express my opinion!

859
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:42,806
Even Michelle thought
there were discrepancies.

860
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:46,520
After a police investigation,
a trial, six years of appeals?

861
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:51,008
And you found discrepancies? How long
did it take you, half an hour?

862
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:52,405
You know the system.

863
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:55,966
His first attorney was probably
some 1 2-year-old legal-aid guy.

864
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:59,879
He couldn't object enough for the court
to make an intelligent decision.

865
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:01,967
-lf they could make one.
-Come on.

866
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:03,359
l got your appeal.

867
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:05,641
They're going
to kill the guy tonight.

868
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:11,840
All right.
Man, l must be on acid!

869
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:16,282
So you're telling me you want
to turn a routine execution piece. . .

870
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:18,640
. . .into a fight-for-justice story. . .

871
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:21,239
. . .and give me an excuse
to stand up for you. . .

872
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:24,806
. . .when Bob asks me
to transfer you to the toilet.

873
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:26,963
Alan, l need this.

874
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:32,166
You won't get your wife and kid back.
She'll find out.

875
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:33,121
l'll fix that.

876
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:37,198
l can't tell you what will happen
if this is another Vargas piece.

877
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:41,847
So you come up with something, fine.
l'll run it. But it better be good.

878
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:45,839
The Vargas thing, l was drinking.
You lose your nose. My nose is back.

879
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:48,770
Well, we'll both find out, won't we?

880
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,448
Just one thing.

881
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:55,644
lf l come up with something,
we can't wait till tomorrow to run it.

882
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:58,364
My God! l know what you're thinking.

883
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:01,323
lt's like dogs that hear
a sound that humans can't.

884
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:05,398
l can actually hear your little brain
ticking away. l really can.

885
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:09,439
lf you go to Lowenstein
thinking he'll call the governor--

886
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,288
The governor will listen to him.

887
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:14,368
lt better be good. Or he not only
won't call the governor. . .

888
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:17,403
. . .he'll eat your heart
and throw you to the dogs.

889
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:21,365
You won't have to bone his wife, pal.
He'll fire you for free.

890
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:23,484
Thanks.

891
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:27,689
You don't have to thank me.

892
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:31,599
l don't know whose ass you're trying
to save, Beechum's or yours.

893
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:35,878
But if your nose for a story is gone,
my friend, you are gone too.

894
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:37,962
Because l won't run this paper. . .

895
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:41,003
. . .to salvage what's left
of your smarmy existence.

896
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:46,241
So you stand there and you look me in
the eye and you tell me, man-to-man:

897
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:49,208
Was she pretty good?

898
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:51,481
-Seriously.
-Fuck you.

899
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:53,449
Lucky bastard!

900
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:55,488
Go get them, tiger.

901
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:35,327
l don't know what to say to you.

902
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:39,408
Been trying to figure out. . .

903
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:43,319
. . .what it was l wanted to say
to you, and l don't. . . .

904
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:47,568
l'm sorry, Bob.

905
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:49,881
l really am sorry.

906
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:54,926
l don't think you are.

907
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,605
l don't think you're
capable of feeling sorry.

908
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:02,121
You're not capable of feeling
anything for other people.

909
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:06,523
Maybe you're right.

910
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:09,482
Maybe you're right, Bob.

911
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:11,649
How'd you find out?

912
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,203
She told me.

913
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:16,765
She told you?

914
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:23,722
She saved your cigarette butts
in an ashtray by the side of the bed.

915
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:26,803
Her way of letting me know.

916
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:37,965
l guess that's all l was, a way of
getting your attention.

917
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:44,439
lf it helps any, l feel awful.

918
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:48,485
lt doesn't help.

919
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,880
That is so beautiful, sweetheart.

920
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:13,167
l'll keep it with me always.
l promise you.

921
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,161
Can we come back tomorrow?

922
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:20,004
Can we stay at the motel again?

923
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:22,089
Tomorrow.

924
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:27,040
Tomorrow you and Mama get to go home.

925
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:30,926
l don't want to go home.
l want to stay with you.

926
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:42,168
Come on, sweetie.

927
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:44,401
You're a big girl now.

928
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:47,683
You know what's
going on here, don't you?

929
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:51,200
Now, you know, after today. . .

930
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:56,439
. . .you won't see Daddy no more.

931
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:00,684
But l will be there in spirit.

932
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:03,403
l promise.

933
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:06,689
You can talk to me
whenever you want, all right?

934
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:10,847
Remember what we talked about,
the little baby Jesus?

935
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:12,925
Remember that?

936
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:17,004
Well, l will be up there with Him.
And l will be watching you.

937
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:21,928
And l'll wait for you.

938
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:27,325
And if you want to talk to me anytime,
l will be there. . .

939
01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:28,923
. . .listening.

940
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:41,123
l'll miss you so bad, honey.

941
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:45,760
l wrote you a letter.

942
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:51,042
And your mama will have it. . .

943
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:54,202
. . .when you need it later on, okay?

944
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,529
You go on now.

945
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:04,645
Gail, you want to take these, honey?

946
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:06,598
Take these, okay?

947
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:08,921
Come on. lt's time.

948
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:11,768
l love you.

949
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:17,040
l'll always love you, Gail.
Okay?

950
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:20,000
Why can't you just come home?

951
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:25,161
Why can't you just kill
all these people and come home?

952
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:28,882
Don't say that, Gail.
Don't ever say that, okay?

953
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:31,438
Don't ever say that.

954
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:32,799
l love you, baby!

955
01:02:35,170 --> 01:02:36,922
l'll always love you.

956
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:39,407
Goodbye, Daddy!

957
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:44,641
Goodbye!

958
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:51,243
Oh, God!

959
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:53,879
lt's too much.

960
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:56,360
She loves you. l know, honey.

961
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:34,570
Remind me not to start
a life of crime.

962
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:36,285
They lie, you know?

963
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:38,561
-Who's that?
-Prisoners.

964
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:40,204
That's what they do.

965
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:43,398
Every word they say is a lie.

966
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:45,768
Well, everyone lies, pal.

967
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:48,166
l'm just here to write it down.

968
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:52,405
You've got 1 5 minutes, Mr. Everett. . .

969
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:54,606
. . .by order of Warden Plunkitt.

970
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:56,925
Keep to 1 5 minutes.

971
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:02,848
Mr. Everett, Frank Beechum.

972
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:07,606
All right, have a seat.

973
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:17,164
l got them.

974
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:20,439
So how's that girl?

975
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:22,807
The other, Michelle?

976
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:25,559
l heard she was in
some kind of accident?

977
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:30,526
Yeah, she was.

978
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:33,647
She was in a car wreck.

979
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:35,249
She didn't make it.

980
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:37,884
Oh, man.

981
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:40,883
l'm sorry to hear that.

982
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:44,969
Thanks.

983
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:51,568
l guess you want to hear. . .

984
01:04:51,810 --> 01:04:54,449
. . .about how it feels to be in here.

985
01:04:57,890 --> 01:04:59,960
Yeah, it's a human-interest piece.

986
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:04,969
l feel isolated.

987
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:07,805
l feel fear.

988
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:10,608
Fear of pain.

989
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:14,281
Fear of prison.

990
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:17,924
Fear of being separated
from my loved ones.

991
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:22,358
All those fears rolled up into one.

992
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:28,159
Never having a chance to see
my daughter draw pictures like this.

993
01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:34,520
She says it's Green Pastures.

994
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:46,167
l want to tell everyone that. . .

995
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:49,208
. . .l believe in Jesus Christ,
our Lord and Savior.

996
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:58,362
l believe l'm going to a better place.

997
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:04,125
And there's a better place,
better justice there.

998
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:06,758
l came into my faith. . .

999
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:08,409
. . .late in life.

1000
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:13,327
Did a lot of bad things
when l was younger. You know?

1001
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:16,009
Anyway. . .

1002
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:20,044
. . .l believe the crookeds will
be made straight.

1003
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:23,362
That's what the Bible says.
l believe that.

1004
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:31,001
So that's how l feel about it.

1005
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:36,201
ls that all right, Mr. Everett?

1006
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:37,804
You got nine more minutes.

1007
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:45,205
l mean, is there any more
that you want?

1008
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:50,760
Mr. Beechum, you don't know me.

1009
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:54,039
l'm just a guy out there
with a screw loose.

1010
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:59,568
Frankly, l don't give a rat's ass
about Jesus Christ. . .

1011
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:02,802
. . .and l don't care about
justice in this world or the next.

1012
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:05,769
l don't even care what's right or wrong.
Never have.

1013
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:07,929
But you know what this is?

1014
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:11,802
What is this, some kind of joke?

1015
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:14,723
No, it's no joke.
That's my nose.

1016
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:18,485
To tell you the pitiful truth,
that's all l have in life.

1017
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:21,767
When it tells me something stinks. . .

1018
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:24,888
. . .l have faith in it,
like you have faith in Jesus.

1019
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:30,009
When my nose is working well,
l know there's truth there somewhere.

1020
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:32,563
But if it isn't working. . .

1021
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:36,082
. . .you may as well drive me off a cliff.
l'm nothing.

1022
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:39,280
Lately. . .

1023
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:41,169
. . .l'm not 1 00% sure. . .

1024
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:43,970
. . .my nose has been working that great.

1025
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:46,242
So l've got to ask you. . .

1026
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:48,647
. . .did you kill that woman or not?

1027
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:50,600
What?

1028
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:57,136
What happened at that store that day
Amy Wilson was shot?

1029
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:04,459
l went into the store to buy
a bottle of A-1 Sauce.

1030
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,292
You paid at the counter--

1031
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:08,053
No, l never got it.

1032
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:11,811
l told everybody this.
Why are you asking me this?

1033
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,416
Tell it again. To me.

1034
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,218
l went into the store. . .

1035
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:25,089
. . .to buy a bottle of A-1 Sauce.

1036
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:28,692
l didn't know where it was.
Amy was behind the counter.

1037
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:31,329
Hey, Amy.
Where you keep the steak sauce?

1038
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:34,697
lt's in the back. See where the
ketchup and relish is?

1039
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:37,372
l've been meaning to talk to you.

1040
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:39,733
l don't have it.

1041
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:43,256
l mean l could give you 30 now,
but l don't have it all.

1042
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:45,772
When can you give me the whole 96?

1043
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:49,131
When l get paid, July 1 5th.

1044
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:51,695
You're not gonna always do this,
are you?

1045
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:56,536
No, l swear. lt's just, the end of
school year. We have extra expenses.

1046
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:00,259
All right, then.

1047
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,135
July 1 5th?

1048
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:03,973
July 1 5th.

1049
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:07,254
Mind if l use the bathroom?

1050
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,650
You know where it is, right?

1051
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:15,170
So you weren't mad about the money?

1052
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:19,053
l just wanted her to know l didn't
do business that way.

1053
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:21,097
She was cool. l liked her.

1054
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:23,013
Were you carrying a gun?

1055
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:26,975
So then what?

1056
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:33,938
l asked her, could l use her restroom.

1057
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:37,809
l went in to use the restroom,
and the next thing l know. . .

1058
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,779
. . .there was a gunshot.

1059
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:41,935
That's all you got?

1060
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:44,819
lt's the Fourth of July
and we're not that busy.

1061
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:46,618
-Give me the chain!
-Not that!

1062
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:48,498
Give me the fucking chain!

1063
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:04,053
Oh, God. Amy!

1064
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:09,774
Oh, Jesus!

1065
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:14,449
Oh, God!

1066
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,015
Sweet Jesus!

1067
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,209
Can you breathe, Amy?

1068
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:31,891
Somebody help us!

1069
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:47,449
Anybody here?

1070
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:12,455
Help!

1071
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:15,488
-''Please, not that. ''
-That's what l heard.

1072
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:17,093
Why'd you run?

1073
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:21,089
lt was stupid. But l've been
running from something most of my life.

1074
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:24,338
There l was, covered in blood
next to a dead girl. . .

1075
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:27,811
. . .a white man staring at me
like l was-- l just panicked.

1076
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:29,733
-Who shot her?
-l don't know.

1077
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,138
Did Porterhouse see the gun?

1078
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:34,336
-You got five minutes.
-Wasn't no gun!

1079
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:35,729
Did he see the shooter?

1080
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,015
How would l know?

1081
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,409
Of course he didn't.

1082
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:41,379
By the time he pulled in the lot,
the shooter had left.

1083
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:43,497
That's why he didn't hear the shots.

1084
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,338
l don't know when anything happened.

1085
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:50,289
That's because you were on the floor
trying to save Amy's life.

1086
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:53,771
What was this, a random shooting?
Or was someone else there?

1087
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:56,136
l don't know.
l didn't see anything.

1088
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:57,369
Give me something!

1089
01:11:57,620 --> 01:12:00,339
What do you want?
What do you people want?

1090
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:01,899
That's it.

1091
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:06,256
You believe us, don't you?
Do you believe us?

1092
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:08,931
-Bonnie, don't.
-Do you believe us?

1093
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,730
Yes! l believe you.

1094
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:12,890
For chrissake!

1095
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:15,700
Where's your heart?
Don't these people have enough?

1096
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:17,453
Then where were you?

1097
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:22,410
Dear God! Where were you
all this time?

1098
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:25,659
lt wasn't my story.
There was an accident--

1099
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:31,011
Where were you?

1100
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:38,579
Everett?

1101
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:41,733
Warden.

1102
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:45,339
You know, people come
in here, the press.

1103
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:49,698
Prisoners tell them things.
All kind of heart-wrenching things.

1104
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:54,452
And the next day in the paper,
we come off sounding like hard guys.

1105
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:57,011
lt can get pretty frustrating, is all.

1106
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:58,818
Yeah, of course.

1107
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:01,694
We have to do what
the state tells us to do.

1108
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:04,008
Makes it tough on us. . .

1109
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:07,730
. . .if we show up in the paper
as bloody murderers.

1110
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:12,212
Yeah, l understand. Completely.

1111
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:14,013
Knew you would.

1112
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:19,411
These things go through all kind
of trials and appeals. . .

1113
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:21,571
. . .before they get to us.

1114
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:25,419
No use trying to figure out
who's naughty or nice. . .

1115
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:28,857
. . .and then come sliding down the
chimney like a hero.

1116
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,252
Not on execution day.

1117
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:34,858
You're not Santa Claus.

1118
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:39,729
No such thing as Santa Claus.

1119
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:49,215
Warden?

1120
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:53,771
You're not really sure, are you?

1121
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,617
You drive safe now.

1122
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:17,170
-Cecilia, l want to talk.
-Not a good time.

1123
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:18,648
Not now. Call my office.

1124
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:21,050
-This is important.
-Please, just back up.

1125
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:22,735
Back off, will you?

1126
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,698
What are you, a court attorney?

1127
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:27,374
Hit a reporter.
See how long you keep your job.

1128
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:30,134
-Why don't you get in the car?
-Yeah, why don't you?

1129
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,058
New York asshole!

1130
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:36,178
-What is it?
-Frank Beechum. Who else was there?

1131
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:37,819
Are you back on the bottle?

1132
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:41,655
There was Frank Beechum, Nancy
Larson, Porterhouse. . . .

1133
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,618
-Who else?
-What's the difference?

1134
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:45,657
That's the one who shot Amy.

1135
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:49,609
l don't know what kind of conspiracy
theory you're working on. . .

1136
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:53,614
. . .but we've got a solid case.
l don't send innocent men to death.

1137
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:55,134
l know that. l do.

1138
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:58,452
But you made a mistake.
He was just using the bathroom.

1139
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:00,372
He went in for steak sauce.

1140
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,889
You've always been
a gullible son of a bitch.

1141
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:07,457
Read the transcripts.
A witness saw Beechum with a gun.

1142
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:10,134
He couldn't have.
Not through the potato chips.

1143
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,699
ls that what he said?

1144
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,692
l saw it in his eyes.
l could tell.

1145
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:17,052
-You haven't got jack shit.
-How much jack shit do l need?

1146
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,416
There was somebody, wasn't there?

1147
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:23,891
A kid got a Coke from the machine.
He didn't even look inside.

1148
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:25,493
He's the one who killed Amy.

1149
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:28,652
We interviewed him.
We issued a description of his car.

1150
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:29,776
His story checked out--

1151
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:32,659
The plain fact is you had
Beechum in custody.

1152
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,731
You didn't have the right person.

1153
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:36,811
-This was the right guy.
-He was nothing!

1154
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:41,451
He was in a lineup with Beechum.
Both witnesses still fingered Beechum.

1155
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:45,659
He was gone before the witnesses
even got there. Just give me his name.

1156
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:47,811
How can l remember after six years?

1157
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:50,620
-You've got files!
-He was nothing to the case!

1158
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:53,891
Call in the morning.
l'll try to help.

1159
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:57,132
You wait till morning,
you better sleep well tonight.

1160
01:15:57,380 --> 01:16:00,372
Because after today, l'm gonna haunt
the shit out of you.

1161
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:03,339
l'm gonna haunt your ass all over
this goddamn town.

1162
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,813
l am not Wally.
l'm a lot bigger than Wally.

1163
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:10,018
Threaten me and l'll have
pieces of you in the gutter. . .

1164
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:11,773
. . .and l'll blow the rest away.

1165
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,699
One more thing, barfly.

1166
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:22,256
You ought to know this before your
latest lost cause confesses.

1167
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:25,697
Did you know Beechum volunteered
for a lie detector test?

1168
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:32,176
And he flunked it bigtime.
Sure, it's inadmissible.

1169
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:34,492
lt wasn't
in the transcripts. . .

1170
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:37,095
. . .but it certainly captured
our attention.

1171
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:41,168
So why don't you just go pour yourself
a tall one and think about that?

1172
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:08,175
You want a nip?

1173
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:10,693
No, thanks. l'd better not.

1174
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:12,339
Sorry, l forgot.

1175
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:17,978
What's with Bob? He's been
giving you the evil eye all day.

1176
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:20,330
Know something?
lt's starting to work.

1177
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:23,890
Did something happen at the
prison? Some big uproar?

1178
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:27,689
Why would a guilty man volunteer
for a lie detector test?

1179
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:31,018
Happens all the time.
Perp thinks he can slide one by.

1180
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:34,698
Of course, innocent men
flunk them sometimes too.

1181
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,138
Does Bob want you to take one?

1182
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:39,012
That's a cute idea.

1183
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:41,575
l don't think
my guilt's in any doubt.

1184
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:44,493
Where's Bridget?
l want her to do some scutwork.

1185
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:47,334
Women feel much more secure
in the workplace now.

1186
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:50,174
She left. But l'll get
your coffee if you give me head.

1187
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:57,695
Better yet, track down an
investigator in the Beechum case.

1188
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:59,339
See if there was another. . .

1189
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:00,974
. . .witness on the scene.

1190
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:03,529
A kid. Just an address
and a name will do.

1191
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:04,849
You got it.

1192
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:06,892
After that, get me some coffee.

1193
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:16,458
Oakland Police.
Sgt. Bartlett.

1194
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:19,897
Donaldson at the Tribune.
Who headed the Beechum case?

1195
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:22,256
Anyone there know the Beechum case?

1196
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:24,132
All of us. Anyone here.

1197
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:26,132
Before Beechum comes to the store. . .

1198
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:29,417
. . .there's another witness
in the parking lot, right?

1199
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:32,493
Wrong. There's nothing
like that in the files.

1200
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:35,857
-How do you know? Have you looked?
-Believe me, we know.

1201
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:38,295
Everybody here has
memorized these files.

1202
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:41,612
No other witnesses.
Porterhouse and Larson, that's it.

1203
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:43,657
But a lot of circumstantial.

1204
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:45,811
This is Donaldson at the Tribune.

1205
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:49,336
On the Beechum case, was there
a record of a kid who was a witness?

1206
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:50,569
A kid?

1207
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:52,819
l don 't think so.

1208
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:55,774
-You're sure?
-Thanks anyway.

1209
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,175
All right, thanks.

1210
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:04,250
That was the whip in the investigation.

1211
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:07,731
Says it rings a bell.
But he doesn't remember any names.

1212
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:12,093
Ardsley, who headed the investigation,
retired. Florida somewhere.

1213
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:13,694
Shit!

1214
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,212
Everett! Come here.

1215
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,499
Shit!

1216
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:28,017
-Don't look so happy about it.
-Who said anything about being happy?

1217
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:32,458
l understand your prison interview went
beyond just a human-interest sidebar.

1218
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:36,215
l colored outside the lines a bit,
but the warden wasn't sore about it.

1219
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:39,179
He just probably thought
you were back on the booze.

1220
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:42,014
-There's no smoking in the building.
-You got a minute?!

1221
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:43,375
l can't tolerate this.

1222
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:46,214
Steve, say you're sorry.
Bob, punch his lights out.

1223
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:47,654
This isn't personal.

1224
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:50,619
l gave him an important story
with specific instructions.

1225
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:52,054
The newspaper promised--

1226
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:54,336
-The guy is not guilty.
-Come on!

1227
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:57,811
This isn't a human-interest sidebar.
lt's a crucifixion.

1228
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:01,450
Want me to look at the cross and say
''How's the weather up there?''

1229
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:04,658
l've got all the personal crap
here in this book.

1230
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:07,933
He believes in God.
Thinks he's going to heaven.

1231
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:10,853
He's happy as shit.
He's glad they're juicing him.

1232
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:13,170
-Go write your sidebar!
-That's not the point.

1233
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:14,819
Of course it's not the point.

1234
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:18,370
Fine. Take Steve off the
execution and put Harvey on it.

1235
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:21,657
-That's still not the point.
-We know what the point is.

1236
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:23,459
l can't work with you, Steve.

1237
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:24,929
You're a good reporter. . .

1238
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:28,855
. . .but there's plenty of good
reporters here who follow instructions.

1239
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:30,089
l can't work with him.

1240
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:32,058
Why don't you hit me in the face?

1241
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:33,733
l'll fall down. l'll bleed.

1242
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:35,857
l'll do all that. l deserve it.

1243
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:38,739
Then go home and hit your wife.
She likes it.

1244
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,774
Nice one, babe.

1245
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:49,691
We can't all live in the world
of your imagination.

1246
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:53,489
l won't hit anybody, because that's
exactly what you'd want.

1247
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:57,779
lf Patricia needs to find something
outside our marriage, she can find it.

1248
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,170
My marriage isn't your business,
number one.

1249
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:02,729
Number two, you're a thoughtless. . .

1250
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:05,574
. . .unbalanced man.
l can't work with him!

1251
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,731
l've enjoyed this episode of Oprah--

1252
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:09,254
l got the shooter.

1253
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:15,493
-We shouldn't confuse the issues.
-l got the guy who killed Amy Wilson.

1254
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:18,732
-Even if it's the guy who shot JFK--
-Bob, shut up!

1255
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:20,174
How have you got him?

1256
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,297
l've got him. l know who he is.

1257
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:24,374
All right, who is he?

1258
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:27,453
He's a guy.
He's a guy who was there.

1259
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:34,009
You're telling me that the shooter
is a guy who was there?

1260
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:38,056
Great! Should l hold the front
page or wait for two sources?

1261
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:39,938
The D.A. won't give me the name.

1262
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:43,138
-What about the defense?
-The defense doesn't have it.

1263
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,615
This is ridiculous.

1264
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:47,614
Shut. . .

1265
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:48,616
. . .up.

1266
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:52,013
What about the cops?

1267
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:54,453
They're sitting on it.

1268
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:55,610
Jesus!

1269
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:58,010
Sorry, Alan. This is just too much.

1270
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:01,054
Alan, l gotta be clear
on this, okay?

1271
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:03,416
This is causing problems for everybody.

1272
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:05,571
l love the paper
but l'm ready to go.

1273
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:09,574
l can't work like this.
This environment's become intolerable.

1274
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:12,175
''lntolerable environment''?
Are you a feminist?

1275
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:14,536
Are you a cooze?
What's wrong with you?

1276
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:16,418
You gotta give me notice.

1277
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:22,652
My contract says if you dump me,
you gotta give me notice.

1278
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:25,052
How much notice do you want?

1279
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:30,175
Six hours and seven minutes.

1280
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:41,650
Testing red. Testing red.

1281
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:46,728
Testing tan. Testing tan.

1282
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:51,297
Testing white. Testing white.

1283
01:22:52,940 --> 01:22:55,295
Testing black.

1284
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:01,736
We're in San Quentin 's
gas chamber...

1285
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:04,050
...now converted
for lethal injection.

1286
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:07,497
The first syringe delivers five grams
of sodium Pentothal...

1287
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:11,255
...and that will put him to sleep
within a few seconds.

1288
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:15,573
Then the injection line is flushed
with 20 cc's of saline solution...

1289
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:19,290
...and then he'll be given 50 cc's
of pancuronium bromide.

1290
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:22,777
Now that is a muscle paralyzer,
and at that point...

1291
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:24,692
...he won 't be able to breathe.

1292
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:28,057
And finally, 50 cc's
of potassium chloride.

1293
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,256
And that'll stop his heart.

1294
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:03,938
Yes, this is--

1295
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:07,294
This is Steve's wife. Why?

1296
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:11,414
What's the matter?
Something happen to him?

1297
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:37,773
Already, the vultures come--

1298
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:41,018
So steal. Go ahead.

1299
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:42,659
Mr. Ziegler?

1300
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:46,499
l'm not a thief.

1301
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:49,652
l'm a friend of Michelle's,
a colleague at the paper.

1302
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:52,370
My friends, most of them knock.

1303
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:55,133
l'm sorry.

1304
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:59,172
l'm sorry about Michelle.
She was really topnotch.

1305
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:01,490
A really fine reporter.

1306
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:04,571
So you came to give the eulogy?

1307
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:06,253
Michelle was on a story.

1308
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:10,295
A man will be executed tonight.
l think he's innocent.

1309
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:13,338
l think the answer may be in
Michelle's papers.

1310
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:15,929
Something Michelle did?

1311
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,772
Something she was onto, yeah.

1312
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:19,849
So look!

1313
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:21,215
Great.

1314
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:25,215
l've been going through her things too.

1315
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:27,539
See this?

1316
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:30,780
Gave her this when she was 9.
She loved it.

1317
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:35,014
She saved everything.

1318
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:38,008
Look at this.

1319
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:41,696
l don't know when she did it.
Must have been 4 or 5.

1320
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:47,416
Where'd this come from? Over here?

1321
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:56,973
This anything?

1322
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:59,859
''Warren Russel, 1 7 years old.

01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:03,888

''Says he bought a soda and left.
Saw nothing.

Something fishy here. ''

1326
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:16,579
Mr. Ziegler, that Michelle, she was
really on top of things.

1327
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:18,094
Great!

1328
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:32,893
Sorry, Frank.

1329
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:35,728
We'll have to ask Mrs. Beechum
to leave now.

1330
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:37,979
Give us a minute, okay?

1331
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:40,935
Sure.

1332
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:46,371
l don't think l can do this.

1333
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:53,693
l won't get a chance
to say goodbye later on.

1334
01:26:58,220 --> 01:27:01,974
So l need you to take care
of yourself and our little girl.

1335
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:04,737
You know l will, baby.

1336
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:06,892
-l will.
-And give her this.

1337
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:08,979
And don't forget.

1338
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:12,373
lt ain't much, but it's--

1339
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:14,736
lt'll be precious to her.

1340
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:17,770
lt will be her most precious thing.

1341
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:22,579
l really hate that
you have to go through this.

1342
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:24,779
l know.

1343
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:26,770
Okay, l love you.

1344
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:28,772
l love you.

1345
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:32,251
l wanted to be there for you.

1346
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:35,139
God knows l wanted to see
my little girl grow up.

1347
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:38,978
lf we just had more time--

1348
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:42,333
We have to be thankful
for the time we had.

1349
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:43,933
lt's that it was short.

1350
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:45,614
At least we made Gail.

1351
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:47,498
We made Gail together.

1352
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:50,095
We made something beautiful
in this world.

1353
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:53,937
You look at her and remember
how much l love you.

1354
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:55,775
Can you do that?

1355
01:27:56,660 --> 01:27:58,173
God, Frank, l'm so scared.

1356
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:00,728
lf l can see your face--

1357
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:02,652
l'll talk to you every day.

1358
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:05,850
-lf l can see you at the end.
-Come with me!

1359
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:08,091
You going to be talking to me?

1360
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:10,168
lf l could see your face!

1361
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:12,809
How did this ever happen to us?

1362
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:21,460
The only thing in my life. . .

1363
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:23,776
. . .that made it worth anything.

1364
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:27,135
God bless you for that.

1365
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:32,693
God bless you for that.

1366
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:38,689
Who's there?

1367
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:43,577
l'm Steve Everett. l'm a reporter
for the Tribune.

1368
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:56,453
Go home!

1369
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:00,250
And quit casing that man's car.

1370
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:02,818
lt's almost your dinnertime.

1371
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:04,288
Go home!

1372
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:11,249
-Sorry about them kids.
-That's all right.

1373
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,297
l'm just glad to find you here.

1374
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:16,609
What, you thought l moved
to the suburbs?

1375
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:20,528
Come on in.

1376
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:27,808
And you are. . .?

1377
01:29:28,060 --> 01:29:29,015
Angela Russel.

1378
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:30,295
And Warren?

1379
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:32,129
My grandson.

1380
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:36,334
ls this Warren here?

1381
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:38,008
lt is.

1382
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:40,012
Want to tell me why you're here?

1383
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:44,532
Mrs. Russel, it's important
that l talk to Warren.

1384
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:46,975
lt's important l talk to him tonight.

1385
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:51,259
lt is? And what could be so important,
if you don't mind my asking?

1386
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:55,659
There's a man on death row, and
they're gonna execute him tonight.

1387
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:58,410
They say he killed
a store clerk. . .

1388
01:29:58,660 --> 01:30:00,571
. . .six years ago. An Amy Wilson.

1389
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:02,134
l think he's innocent.

1390
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:04,689
l think Warren knows
something about it.

1391
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:06,976
Why would you
think a thing like that?

1392
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:09,975
He's the only other person
that was there.

1393
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:12,739
And how do we know that?

1394
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:15,770
The witnesses didn't see anyone else.

1395
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:21,052
Wait a minute. There were witnesses,
even though nobody else was there?

1396
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:24,133
-Yes, that's right--
-No, wait. Help me out here.

1397
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:26,212
l am getting confused.

1398
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,934
There was an accountant
and a housewife.

1399
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:31,854
White people?

1400
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:37,534
And l bet. . .

1401
01:30:37,780 --> 01:30:40,533
. . .that girl that got killed,
that Amy Wilson. . .

1402
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:42,577
. . .she was white too, wasn't she?

1403
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:45,290
That's right. But l don't think--

1404
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:48,008
You don't think those nice
white people. . .

1405
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:50,216
. . .would kill that nice white girl.

1406
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:52,298
But they all looked around. . .

1407
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:55,498
. . .and what do you know?
There was a black boy.

1408
01:30:56,780 --> 01:30:57,974
Look, it isn't like that.

1409
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:01,690
Will you just think back
in your mind? Six years ago.

1410
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:04,659
Was Warren using drugs
or anything like that?

1411
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:06,049
He was into drugs.

1412
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:07,415
Did he own a gun?

1413
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:10,970
They all own guns, Mr. Everett.
Don't you know that?

1414
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:15,133
All those black dope-fiend boys,
they all own guns.

1415
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:17,574
Can l just talk to him?

1416
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:19,458
Do you know where he is?

1417
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:22,979
Yes, l do.

1418
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:25,572
And no, you can't.

1419
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:29,529
Look, an innocent man
is gonna die tonight.

1420
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,695
l have seen a lot of innocent folk. . .

1421
01:31:32,940 --> 01:31:36,012
. . .die in this part of town,
Mr. Everett.

1422
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:37,734
But it's funny.

1423
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:41,252
l ain't never seen you
around here before.

1424
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:45,619
Mrs. Russel, you're making this into
a racial thing, and it isn't.

1425
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:48,249
The man on death row,
he's a black man too.

1426
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:49,899
Did you know that?

1427
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:54,258
They'll kill him at midnight.
l can't help unless l have the facts.

1428
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:57,857
The only fact l know, Mr. Everett. . .

1429
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:00,571
. . .is that my grandson, Warren. . .

1430
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:04,530
. . .he's been in his grave now
going on three years.

1431
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:08,210
Stabbed out there in the park.

1432
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:16,218
My Warren. . .

1433
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:18,530
. . .was a loving child.

1434
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:21,649
But l don't remember you
coming around. . .

1435
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:25,131
. . .looking for the facts
when he was killed.

1436
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:29,734
Nobody came around here
looking for the facts then.

1437
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:37,334
Fucking loser!

1438
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:39,411
Goddamn it!

1439
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:47,813
We're told he's having
the last meal he requested...

1440
01:32:48,060 --> 01:32:50,016
...steak and french fries.
Oddly enough...

1441
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:52,820
...he also requested two
six-packs of Coke.

1442
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:56,336
lf you're just tuning in,
we'll repeat our top story.

1443
01:32:56,580 --> 01:33:01,290
Convicted killer Frank Beechum has,
for the first time, confessed his crime.

1444
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:03,771
The confession was made
to the chaplain...

1445
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:05,419
...as an expression of remorse...

1446
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:09,653
...for the murder of Amy Wilson
and her unborn child six years ago.

1447
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:13,256
A source in the governor's office
says despite this...

1448
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:17,857
... the execution will proceed
at one minute after midnight tonight.

1449
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:20,898
And in other news, the market
slumped badly....

1450
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:00,976
l am tired.

1451
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:03,051
Aren't you supposed to be sleeping?

1452
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:05,609
Why are you here, Daddy?

1453
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:11,060
l'm here to see you, you little goon.

1454
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:14,252
Where did you go?

1455
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:17,692
A wild-goose chase.

1456
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:19,692
You went chasing?

1457
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:25,418
Chasing salvation.
Never did find it.

1458
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:27,214
Just disappeared.

1459
01:34:34,940 --> 01:34:35,816
Let me tell you. . . .

1460
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:37,937
About today, l'm sorry.

1461
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:40,619
Maybe this weekend we'll. . .

1462
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:43,818
. . .go and spend the whole day?
Play Slow Zoo.

1463
01:34:46,540 --> 01:34:48,212
And this time, could we see. . .

1464
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:50,257
. . .the hippopotamus?

1465
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:53,298
l've already talked to him.
We have an appointment.

1466
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:57,532
My little Daddy.

1467
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:00,010
l'll go to sleep now.

1468
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:03,411
Okay, l think that's a good idea.

1469
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:10,293
Close them, now.

1470
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:49,139
lf this were a bullet. . .

1471
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:56,578
. . .you'd be dead.

1472
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:01,213
Bob call you?

1473
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:05,500
What difference does
it make who called me?

1474
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:11,014
l know you're going to apologize.

1475
01:36:11,740 --> 01:36:14,095
l know you will try to do better.

1476
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:17,410
But l don't want this anymore.

1477
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:19,532
Because l'm tired.

1478
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:26,849
l just think this'll be hard on her.

1479
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:42,656
Barbara, l can change.

1480
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:46,656
Can't we just erase all this?

1481
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:49,653
l just had a terribly
ridiculous day.

1482
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:52,972
lt isn't just today.

1483
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:56,659
But today is the end of it.

1484
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:58,777
Today l understand.

1485
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:02,010
Hell, l know l've been. . .

1486
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:04,251
. . .tempted a lot, but. . . .

1487
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:06,733
But l love you, baby.

1488
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:15,372
lt's just that l. . . .

1489
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:21,937
l'm just kind of coming apart here,
and l didn't. . . .

1490
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:26,132
l know it's nobody's fault
but my own.

1491
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:29,777
l need you. l got to put
these pieces back together.

1492
01:37:35,580 --> 01:37:37,571
l feel sorry for you.

1493
01:37:41,620 --> 01:37:44,578
You and your famous nose for a story.

1494
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:47,657
You think you can just. . .

1495
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:50,574
. . .sniff your way along, you know?

1496
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:53,169
From one hunch to another. . .

1497
01:37:53,860 --> 01:37:57,933
. . .one girl to another, one drink to
another when you're drinking.

1498
01:37:58,180 --> 01:38:00,819
But l'm not one of your stories, Ev.

1499
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:04,258
l'm your wife.

1500
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:10,931
You can't line up all the facts. . .

1501
01:38:11,180 --> 01:38:13,489
. . .and think you know something
about me.

1502
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:17,373
Your hunches. . .

1503
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:19,492
. . .are shit.

1504
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:24,894
Even when they're right, they're shit.

1505
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:28,617
They're all l've got.

1506
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:35,168
l hope they do somebody
some good someday. . .

1507
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:39,413
. . .because they sure as hell didn't
do us any good, did they?

1508
01:38:41,740 --> 01:38:43,378
l packed all your stuff.

1509
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:46,737
You can take it now,
or you can come back later.

1510
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:49,136
Please, just get out.

1511
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:51,769
Get out of here, Ev, please.

1512
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:55,498
Just get out.

1513
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:32,977
Sometimes, the governor's aides call me
on matters that concern the governor.

1514
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:36,053
ln giving spiritual guidance
and ministrations. . .

1515
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:40,134
. . .l might have misunderstood what
the prisoner said to me.

1516
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:42,940
But these things happen
from time to time.

1517
01:39:45,260 --> 01:39:47,490
lf he says, meaning the prisoner. . .

1518
01:39:47,740 --> 01:39:50,129
. . .says, ''l'm sorry,''
under these extreme--

1519
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:53,770
You know what you've done, right?
l have to call the governor.

1520
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:57,376
l have to issue a retraction to the
press to say there's no confession.

1521
01:39:58,980 --> 01:40:02,290
Beechum has his own pastor.
What the hell were you doing?

1522
01:40:03,860 --> 01:40:05,771
You made me look unprofessional.

1523
01:40:07,820 --> 01:40:09,697
Not a good thing to do.

1524
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:13,531
Spiritually speaking.

1525
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:22,894
lf any of the men
feel they need counseling. . .

1526
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:24,733
. . .l'll be here.

1527
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:27,492
Long as they need me. . .

1528
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:29,168
. . .l'll be here.

1529
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:38,175
You sure you want to do this?

1530
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:40,655
Does a bear shit on Goldilocks?

1531
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:43,892
l don't know.
l've never been asked that before.

1532
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:46,131
That's the trouble with having kids.

1533
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:48,291
lt screws up your quips.

1534
01:40:48,860 --> 01:40:53,456
So you're seriously rolling off
the wagon. Must have been a rough day.

1535
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:56,413
Yeah, lost my wife, lost my kid. . .

1536
01:40:56,660 --> 01:40:59,299
. . .lost my goddamn job.
ls that rough enough?

1537
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:01,132
Did you lose your car too?

1538
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:03,496
Because if you start
driving in this--

1539
01:41:03,740 --> 01:41:06,208
l'm the best fucking driver
on the planet.

1540
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:08,257
l'm talking to a dead man.

1541
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:10,696
Will you leave me
your stamp collection?

1542
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:15,138
How about filling this up?
l ain't eaten anything all day, either.

1543
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:23,650
Jesus Christ!

1544
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:29,930
Go the fuck home, will you?

1545
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:33,058
Ain't got no home.

1546
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:38,495
l ain't got no fucking home.

1547
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:45,769
You have confidence...

1548
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:49,649
... the state should sanction
an execution to satisfy your rage.

1549
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:52,978
Wait. This isn 't about
my rage. Let's be honest.

1550
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:56,018
My daughter was killed in cold
blood for no reason.

1551
01:41:57,100 --> 01:41:58,249
He took $96...

1552
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:00,889
...and a ring
and a locket l'd given her...

1553
01:42:01,140 --> 01:42:02,892
...for her 16th birthday.

1554
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:05,059
My Warren. . .

1555
01:42:05,660 --> 01:42:07,776
. . .was a loving child.

1556
01:42:09,140 --> 01:42:12,450
That's someone who doesn 't deserve
rights as a human being.

1557
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:14,895
-Will you be there tonight?
-You bet.

1558
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:16,809
July 1 5?

1559
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:18,653
July 1 5.

1560
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:20,379
Mind if l use your bathroom?

1561
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:22,696
You know where it is, right?

1562
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:30,569
The fucking money!

1563
01:42:31,460 --> 01:42:33,052
Don't hurt me, please.

1564
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:39,499
What the fuck?
This is all you fucking got?

1565
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:41,776
The 4th of July.
We're not that busy.

1566
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:44,334
Give me the chain!

1567
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:47,339
-Fucking chain!
-No, please, not that!

1568
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:04,895
Amy?

1569
01:43:07,980 --> 01:43:09,208
Jesus!

1570
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:31,018
Still on the Beechum story...

1571
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:33,251
... the report we got
an hour ago...

1572
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:36,492
...in which Frank Beechum
confessed to his crime....

1573
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:40,211
Are you driving?

1574
01:43:56,180 --> 01:43:58,489
You sack of shit! Let's get going!

1575
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:09,258
There are two executioners.
Each one has a button.

1576
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:11,934
Each button is connected
to a computer. . .

1577
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:15,297
. . .that scrambles the circuits
so no one knows who does it.

1578
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:47,773
Brother Beechum, let me
tell you of the Lord.

1579
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:54,374
He is my refuge
and He is my fortress.

1580
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:56,657
He is my God.

1581
01:44:57,460 --> 01:45:01,817
And therefore, even in the darkest
moments, even when there is no hope. . .

1582
01:45:02,580 --> 01:45:05,014
. . .He will deliver you from the snare. . .

1583
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:08,053
. . .of the fowler.

1584
01:45:16,820 --> 01:45:17,969
Step in there.

1585
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:23,130
That Robinson man on TV, l saw him.

1586
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:27,089
And l started remembering that night
Warren gave me that locket.

1587
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:30,936
Her maiden name! And l started
remembering Warren's face.

1588
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:33,250
l can always read that boy's face.

1589
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:36,253
He did a terrible thing, Mr. Everett.

1590
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:40,459
He wasn't a bad boy, but l know
he did a terrible thing!

1591
01:45:40,860 --> 01:45:43,613
They're gonna kill that man
in less than a half-hour.

1592
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:45,976
We can't get to the prison
in that time.

1593
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:49,018
You're right, lady.
Fasten your seat belt.

1594
01:45:50,700 --> 01:45:52,213
Reverend, it's time.

1595
01:46:17,020 --> 01:46:18,453
Set him up.

1596
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:24,777
There's this boy sold
Warren a gun around that time.

1597
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:27,453
This boy's in jail.

1598
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:30,294
He might talk to them
if they give him time off.

1599
01:46:31,180 --> 01:46:34,058
Mrs. Russel, l could kiss you.

1600
01:46:34,820 --> 01:46:36,458
Release your hands.

1601
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:42,052
Gun it, mister!

1602
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:43,779
We go fast.

1603
01:48:11,020 --> 01:48:13,454
Pull over! Pull over
and stop the car!

1604
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:15,852
Don't stop now!

1605
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:58,011
Prepare yourself, all right?

1606
01:49:01,180 --> 01:49:03,250
l'm going to attempt this maneuver.

1607
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:22,778
They really ought to do
something about that place.

1608
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:22,775
Boy, something must be going on.

1609
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:25,739
Maybe a fire, another accident
on the curve.

1610
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:52,215
''To all whom it may concern,
be it known. . .

1611
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:55,179
. . .whereas the Superior Court and
county of Alameda. . .

1612
01:50:55,420 --> 01:50:58,810
. . .ordered that Frank Louis Beechum
suffer the death penalty. . .

1613
01:50:59,060 --> 01:51:00,857
. . .within the walls of San Quentin. . .

1614
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:05,252
. . .for the crime of murder in the first
degree with special circumstances. ''

1615
01:51:10,740 --> 01:51:12,059
l love you.

1616
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:15,816
l love you.

1617
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:22,008
McCardle. Yes, sir.

1618
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:25,735
We have a go.

1619
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:49,813
But it's too late.

1620
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:03,890
Go! Go!

1621
01:54:02,380 --> 01:54:03,529
What's up? lt's official,
it's for the kids.

1622
01:54:04,660 --> 01:54:06,139
l need some charity.

1623
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:09,776
lt's charity on toast, baby. Come on.

1624
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:11,419
How you doing?

1625
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:15,253
Thank you very much.

1626
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:17,538
How you doing, sir?

1627
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:22,018
Kate like that dalmatian?

1628
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:23,295
She loved it.

1629
01:54:23,700 --> 01:54:26,612
Even my ex managed to muster up
a little enthusiasm.

1630
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:29,819
l've got to get something
better for Christmas.

1631
01:54:30,060 --> 01:54:33,132
Sheepdog, collie,
we got Saint Bernards--

1632
01:54:33,380 --> 01:54:34,813
How about a hippopotamus?

1633
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:40,209
Check it out! Local designer,
based on the one at the zoo.

1634
01:54:41,380 --> 01:54:43,974
Yeah, this is a beauty.

1635
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:46,777
Think a homeless man can afford this?

1636
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:48,772
You're not homeless.

1637
01:54:49,180 --> 01:54:51,614
Well, l'm wifeless and jobless. . .

1638
01:54:52,700 --> 01:54:54,418
. . .and l live in a hotel.

1639
01:54:55,980 --> 01:54:57,095
That's unless. . .

1640
01:54:57,460 --> 01:55:00,054
. . .you'd be interested
in putting me up.

1641
01:55:01,700 --> 01:55:03,691
First, you have a big book contract.

1642
01:55:04,300 --> 01:55:05,733
Money's already spent.

1643
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:10,579
Second, everybody says you'll
win the Pulitzer Prize or something.

1644
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:13,254
l think everyone's being
a little optimistic.

1645
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:16,614
And third of all, l have a boyfriend.

1646
01:55:19,740 --> 01:55:21,651
Well, that's good!

1647
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:25,178
Maybe he's out of town
for the holidays.

1648
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:28,172
Cash or charge, Ev?

1649
01:55:30,300 --> 01:55:31,938
l better charge it.

1650
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:34,250
l'm charging everything else
these days.

1651
01:55:35,020 --> 01:55:37,409
Give me some charity, baby.
lt's for the kids.

1652
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:40,054
lt's official!

1653
01:55:40,420 --> 01:55:43,696
l need some charity on toast!
Come over here, help me out.

1654
01:55:49,060 --> 01:55:50,459
l know you got some charity.

1655
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:52,418
You famous! Rich and famous.

1656

l know you got charity on toast.
Give me some charity.

1657
01:55:56,540 --> 01:55:57,859
lt's for the kids.

1658
01:55:58,100 --> 01:55:59,249
That's right, come on.

1659
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:01,650
Give me 20, give me 1 00.
Come on, Steve.

1660
01:56:02,020 --> 01:56:04,488
Take it before my wife does,
and get out of here.

1661
01:56:04,740 --> 01:56:05,536
A 1 0?

1662
01:56:05,780 --> 01:56:09,568
Steve, you got more than that.
Come on, now. lt's for the kids.

1663
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:13,935
All right. All right, newspaperman.

1664
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:16,375
l been here two hours
freezing my ass off.

1665
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:17,575
l'm going home.

1666
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:19,617
You haven't got a home.

1667
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:22,170
l got no wife
and no elves, either.

1668
01:56:22,420 --> 01:56:25,253
You want to be Santa Claus these
days, you on your own.

1669
01:56:29,020 --> 01:56:30,499
You're right there, pal.

1670
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:33,216
Santa Claus rides alone.

1671
01:56:42,020 --> 01:56:43,373
lt's for the kids!

1672
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:50,136
Daddy!

1673
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:51,449
Come on!

1674
01:56:52,060 --> 01:56:53,652
Come on, Daddy.

1675
01:56:57,900 --> 01:56:59,652
Come on, now, Daddy.
