Junior!

700
00:50:34,658 --> 00:50:37,327
Go up to the car
and get the suitcases.

701
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:40,622
Let's get washed up
and the hell out of here.

702
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:42,832
Yeah. Let's do that.

703
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:55,637
Good grief, Frank. We've been
walking for nigh on an hour now.

704
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:59,724
It's 7:00 and we've still got
a good 10 miles to go.

705
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:03,395
If you got any better ideas, Harry,
you just come right out with them.

706
00:51:03,562 --> 00:51:06,815
'Cause I can't think of
any other way to get from here to there

707
00:51:06,982 --> 00:51:09,818
or any other place either,
without riding or walking.

708
00:51:09,985 --> 00:51:13,822
And since riding is out,
thanks to you, you lamebrain you,

709
00:51:13,989 --> 00:51:16,992
then walking is
the only thing that's left.

00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:18,994
Listen.

711
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:21,788
What?

712
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,248
I hear something.

713
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:26,668

you damn fool.

think you are? Tonto?

716
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:36,011
It's a truck.

717
00:51:37,971 --> 00:51:39,389
And some chickens, too.

718
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:41,891
Chickens?

719
00:51:42,976 --> 00:51:45,020
I only tell you
what the road tells me.

720
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:03,872
Listen, Ada, we got a problem here.
This is serious business.

721
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:06,708
Now we got to get to the Collingwood
place right away.

722
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:10,795
Now, this is police business,
and this is an emergency, you hear?

723
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:13,340
Can you help us out?

724
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:14,716
Have to ride on the roof.

725
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,052
On the roof?

726
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:19,346
It's the only place
I have any room.

00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,446
Proceed, Ada.

730
00:52:36,613 --> 00:52:39,616
Now, listen, Harry, if you tell any
of the boys at the lodge about this,

731
00:52:39,783 --> 00:52:40,992
I'm gonna fix your wagon.

734
00:52:55,924 --> 00:52:57,425
What in thunder's
going on here, Ada?

735
00:52:57,592 --> 00:52:59,511
It's got its maximum load.

736
00:52:59,678 --> 00:53:02,555
I couldn't get another chicken on here
without it stalling.

737
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:06,935
And now I got you two on here,
and you two ain't chickens!

738
00:53:07,102 --> 00:53:09,104
You mean this truck
won't start with us on it?

739
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,855
You said it!

740
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:13,422
Listen, Ada, you're gonna have to
take some of those chickens

741
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:14,776
off that truck and let us on,
you hear?

742
00:53:14,943 --> 00:53:16,778
How much do you weigh, Deputy?

743
00:53:16,945 --> 00:53:18,655
185. Why?

744
00:53:18,822 --> 00:53:19,942
How much you weigh, Sheriff?

745
00:53:19,948 --> 00:53:22,117
- About 180.
- Bullshit.

746
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:24,577
Well, maybe 190. I don't
weigh myself every morning.

747
00:53:24,744 --> 00:53:28,081
That's 11 crates of chickens.
And that ain't hay.

748
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:33,253
Now look, Ada, you know I'm
a solemnly sworn officer of the law?

749
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,630
Now, I got the law
on my side, Ada.

750
00:53:35,797 --> 00:53:39,592
And, Sheriff,
I got the chickens and the truck!

752
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:59,320

some in your eye.

How's that?

756
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:17,130
Did I get everything?

757
00:54:22,177 --> 00:54:23,937
- Am I clean?
- Help me out of here. Come on.

- Am I clean?
- Yeah.

makes me wish I was a lady.

of nowhere, you know that?

772
00:55:20,902 --> 00:55:23,238
What are you doing
with the Holy Bible?

we are gathered here..."

what are you doing?

JOHN: Who in the world is it?
I didn't know anyone was coming over.

778
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:50,932
John, I want you to meet
Harvey Wilson and his wife, Dorothy.

779
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:52,851
- How are you?
- Sam Hardy.

780
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:54,017
Sam.

- And Dave Rizalski.
- David.

782
00:55:57,564 --> 00:56:00,525
Do you know their car broke down
right out front, John?

783
00:56:00,692 --> 00:56:03,194
Oh? Anything serious?

784
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:05,864
- Yeah, I'm afraid we blew a rod.
- JOHN: Oh, no.

785
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,783
Well, Willie's Esso station
is the only garage I know,

786
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:10,535
and they close at 6:00.

787
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:12,787
Well, it wouldn't make
any difference anyway.

788
00:56:12,954 --> 00:56:14,038
The phone is still dead.

789
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:16,583
ESTELLE: They wanted us to drive them
to a motel, but I said

790
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:17,789
that would be up to you...

791
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:19,544
Mari still has the car.

792
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,311
It's all right,
we've got plenty of room.

793
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:24,716
ESTELLE: Absolutely. Why,
we have a perfectly good guest room.

794
00:56:24,883 --> 00:56:27,135
And, well, there's
Mari's room, I suppose.

795
00:56:27,302 --> 00:56:29,220
Are you sure we're not gonna
put you folks to any trouble?

796
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:32,390
Nonsense! Our home is yours.
Let me get your bags.

797
00:56:32,557 --> 00:56:37,562
No, no, no! Frank here is younger.
He can handle it.

798
00:56:39,397 --> 00:56:41,900
Well, why don't I show you
to your rooms? Come on.

799
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:43,109
Fine.

800
00:56:52,744 --> 00:56:56,414
Here, and through there. Okay?

801
00:56:56,873 --> 00:57:02,003
I'll put some towels in the bathroom for
you, and you can wash up if you like.

802
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:03,421
Bacon and eggs
all right in the morning?

803
00:57:03,588 --> 00:57:04,589
- Thank you.
- That's marvelous.

804
00:57:04,756 --> 00:57:08,968
Okay, well, we'll be in the living room,
and you can join us if you like.

805
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:11,346
Okay, just make
yourselves comfortable.

806
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:13,014

Very nice.
Very nice.

810

The lady of the house is nice, too.

811
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:33,660
Hey, Krug, I want my fix, man.

813
00:57:35,078 --> 00:57:36,871
- Krug?
- KRUG: Yeah?

814
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:39,874
Look at this.

815
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:43,044
What?

816
00:57:46,172 --> 00:57:48,174

the odds are on that.

FRED: Couldn't even tell you.

820
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:15,576
Feel like playing
"Three Thirds of a Ghost" or something?

821
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:19,372
How would you like me to put my boot
up your ass sideways?

822
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:25,586
I'm sorry I don't have anything
better to offer you, but...

823
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:27,964
It's been such a confusing day.

824
00:58:28,131 --> 00:58:29,924
Hell, you've got a lotto offer.

825
00:58:30,425 --> 00:58:32,760

00:59:07,545 --> 00:59:10,298
No. We're sort of
on a business trip.

829
00:59:10,465 --> 00:59:12,383
What sort of
business are you in?

830
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,343
- Plumbing.
- Insurance.

831
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:16,971
Well, which is it?

832
00:59:18,014 --> 00:59:20,308
You see, we're actually in both.

833
00:59:20,558 --> 00:59:23,144
We sell insurance
to plumbing companies.

834
00:59:23,311 --> 00:59:26,939
You know, in case they steal
some toilets or something.

835
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:28,107
Yeah.

- Stop it!

Shut up!
You're worse than your goddamn mother!

International Bathtub and Sink.

854

$500,000 account,
down the drain, so to speak.
