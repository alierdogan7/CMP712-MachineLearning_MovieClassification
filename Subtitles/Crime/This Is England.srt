177
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,199
- Who the fuck's he?
- What is your name?

178
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,742
I'm Shaun.

179
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,786
Shaun, I'm woody, mate.
Nice to meet you.

180
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,580
That there's Milky, my main man.

181
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,790
Pukey's a nutcase. dort wind him up.

182
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,750
That's Kez. He's pretty chilled out.

183
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,379
- And this fat idiot's Gadget.
- (Laughter)

184
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,799
You are, Gadget, you are.

185
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,093
Anyway, Shaun, move.
You're in my seat.

186
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,344
What?

187
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,637
Move.

188
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,682
Gadget, mate, out of all the places to sit,
you want to sit there?

189
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,350
- Yeah, I do.
SHAUN: Shall I move?

190
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,853
What are you asking him for?
Move, now.

191
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,647
- He dort have to bloody move.
- Fucking does. Get out.

192
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,859
Oi, it's a free country.
You sit there if you want to sit there.

193
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,486
- Have you seen these?
- woody, tell him.

194
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,071
woody, tell 'em.

195
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,489
Get the fuck...

196
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,991
Calm down.

197
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,993
Will you just calm down?

198
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,495
Fucking behave.
You need to learn when to chill out.

199
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,580
What...?

200
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,415
Get the fuck out of my seat now!

201
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,585
Out of this tunnel
or I'll make your life a living fucking hell.

202
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,420
- Fuck off!
- Fuck out!

203
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:56,090
- You're a pain in my arse.
- You're all a bunch of bastards!

204
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,634
Oh, fuck off!

205
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,428
You prick!
Shaun, come back, mate.

206
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,180
- Sit down.
- Oh, bloody hell.

207
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,848
Shaun! Sh...

208
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,226
Oh, I feel bad. I feel bad now.

209
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:10,104
Well done, well done. Are you happy with
your fucking pie now, you prick?

210
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,649
You're a frigging bully, Gadget.

211
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,281
TV: See what you can do with this.

212
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,700
What C is a fodder plant...

213
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,369
(door closes)

214
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,580
- Hiya, love.
- Hell0.

215
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,542
- You all right?
- Yeah.

216
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,794
Had a good day at school?

217
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:38,967
Shaun?

218
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,387
What's wrong, love?
Shaun, come here.

219
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,429
What?

220
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,473
Sit down.
I want to have a word with you.

221
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:46,724
Why?

222
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,768
Please, son, I want to talk to you.

223
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,396
What?

224
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,648
What have you done to your face?

225
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,941
nothing.

226
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,695
You've got all scratches all over your face.
Have you been fighting?

227
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,780
no, I did it on the way home from school.

228
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:04,158
You didn't. You're lying to me.
How have you done it?

229
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,412
It was a boy at school.

230
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,915
He made a j0ke about Dad, so I hit him.

231
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,709
Well, what did he say about Dad?

232
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,878
I dort wanna say it, Mum.
It's disgusting.

233
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,880
Shaun, I want to know what he said.

234
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,258
I've been picked on three times today.

235
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,719
All because of my trousers.

236
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,470
What's wrong with your trousers?

237
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,514
Look at the fucking size of them!

238
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,142
Stop swearing.
There's nothing wrong with them.

239
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,936
- Your dad bought you them.
- They're to0 big for me!

240
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:35,356
If you didn't want to wear them,
you should have put your school ones on.

241
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,984
It's non-uniform day, Mum.

242
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,653
What do you want me to do, Shaun?
I dort know what to do.

243
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,115
- We could move away.
- We can't move away.

244
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,535
We're not moving from anywhere.
We live here and we're staying here.

245
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,370
I dort like it here, Mum.

246
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,583
I liked it better when we were with Dad.

247
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:00,340
Well, I liked it better when we was with Dad,
but Dad's gone now.

248
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,343
(Leisurely guitar instrumental)

249
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,314
(Seagulls cry)

250
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,157
Yes!

251
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,186
(Ship's hooter)

252
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,106
RADIO: Mrs Thatcher's visiting The Antrim

253
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,151
very close to two key events
in the War, for the ship.

254
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,112
Just over there,
in the Falklands Sound,

255
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:32,450
she was hit aft by a 1,0oolb bomb,
which, fortunately, didn't explode,

256
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,494
and there, on Fanning Head,

257
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:39,457
heavy bombardment from The Antrim
took out a key Argentine position.

258
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:43,753
Like the Army, the Navy is still taking
the threat of another Argentine attack

259
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,213
very seriously...

260
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,215
(dog barks)

261
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:50,009
(Clattering and rattling)

262
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,355
...as well as these Oerlikon guns,
the destroyer is armed...

263
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,775
...sea slug, sea cat...

264
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,318
(Thud)

265
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,987
What the fuck?

266
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,204
What do you want, Gadget?
You've just nearly put my window through.

267
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:21,291
(Breathlessly): woody wants to know
if you're coming hunting.

268
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,252
Hunting? Why?

269
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:27,422
Because he feels sorry
for what happened the other day.

270
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,049
And he just wants to know
if you're coming out.

271
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:33,720
If I come, you're just gonna kick my head in
in the middle of a field.

272
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,849
woody said if I come within five feet of you,
he's gonna kick the shit out of me.

273
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,435
And why on earth
are you dressed like that?

274
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,353
We always dress like this.

275
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,063
You look stupid.

276
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,650
I know, but it's just a laugh that we have.

277
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,861
I've got you some stuff. Come on.

278
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:53,239
It's not a trick, is it, Gadget?
woody really wants me to come?

279
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,742
It's no trick, honest. Please?

280
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,411
- All right. I'll be down in a minute.
- Hurry up!

281
00:17:58,453 --> 00:17:59,746
(Giggles)

282
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,207
WOOD Y: Hurry up, you.
GADGET: Give me a hand.

283
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,250
- Fuck it.
- Come on, Tubs!

284
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,086
Hurry up,
cos Gadget wort get over it, will he?

285
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,130
(Laughter)

286
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,260
- Come on.
- Come on. Get up.

287
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,804
Here you are.
Gadget, have that. Have this.

288
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,848
- Gadget!
- Gadget, have this.

289
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,683
I'll have that there, mate.

290
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,268
no, I'm all right.

291
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,312
- Oh, man. wo0!
- I wanted that!

292
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,522

293
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:27,941
Come on!

294
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,862
- Where are you going, Gadge?
SHAUN: Whoa-oa-oah!

295
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,405
WOOD Y: wo0!

(Glass shatters)

299
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,460
(Shaun yells)

300
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,423
WOOD Y: Fuck, yeah! Fucking do it!

301
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,716

302
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,135

do it again and again!

305
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,850

310
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,036
Fucking do it! do it!

Come on, Shaun!

317
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,677
Where are we going?

318
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,721
I'll get you a good seat.

319
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,180
wo0!

320
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,183

(Shaun laughs)

321
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,230
Shaun! Shaun, Shaun, Shaun!

322
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,946
Quick!

323
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,742
Come on. Quickly. Quickly. Ssh!

324
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,793
Where the fuck have yous gone?
Come on.

325
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,837
I can't be doing with this, lads.

326
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,881
I'm not in the mood for this.

327
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,800
I know yous are in here, I'm not stupid.

328
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,427
so, come out.

329
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,597
(Barrage of catapult shots)

330
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,224
Fucker!

331
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,267
(Laughter)

332
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,604
SHAUN: Classical!

333
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:30,980
Classical.

334
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:33,942
- Classic.
SHAUN: Classic. Classic.

335
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,236
WOOD Y: goId, mate. Liquid goId. Brilliant.

336
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,863
SHAUN: That was classic! Classic, classic.

337
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:42,825
Oi, ol, ol!
What's all that about, dickhead, eh?

338
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,744
What's the deal with you, eh?

339
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,996
- He shot me.
- I shot you as well.

340
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,206
Come on, Shauny.

341
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,416
- Bloody hell, Gadget.
- What d'you do that for?

342
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,002
Look how yous
have been treating me all day.

343
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,837
I had to carry all the bags.

344
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,465
All of yous running off on me,
hiding on me.

345
00:20:57,507 --> 00:21:00,802
Listen to me. He's a young lad.
He's had a fucking bad week.

346
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,846
so, we're bringing him with us
to show him a bloody good time

347
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,099
and you just backhanded him
round t'head.

Fella, man,

And I mean that

529
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:13,378
Shaun?

530
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:15,380
Yeah?

531
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,216
Come here, please.

532
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:21,177
I just want to go straight to bed, Mum.

533
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,888
Come here, please.
You're two hours late.

534
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:27,559
- Please, Mum.
- Shaun, just come here!

535
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:38,653
Oh, my God.

536
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:43,950
Mum, please.

537
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:45,451
Please, Mum.

538
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:47,537
- Shaun, come on.
- Oh, man.

539
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:50,039
- Oh, Mum, please.
- I'm not messing around.

540
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:51,624

541
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,335
In you go, you.

- Eh, Shaun!
- Shaun, mate!

543
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,463
- Oh.

544
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,133
Who's Lol?

545
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:02,760
Me.

546
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,805
What have you done to his hair?

547
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,644
I... I did ask him, before I did it, if...
if you was all right with it.

548
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:13,646
dort you think
you should have asked me?

549
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:14,689
Yeah.

550
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:16,357
I'm sorry.

551
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,568
Shaun, did I not ask you
if it was all right?

552
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,904
If he said, "Jump off a cliff",
would you do that?

553
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,239
no.

554
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:27,118
to be honest, you all look a bit... old
to be hanging around with him.

555
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,413
I'm only in the er... year bel...
above in school.

556
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:32,832
- Are you j0king?
- no.

557
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:36,252
I've got problems.

558
00:30:36,294 --> 00:30:37,587
(Sniggering)

559
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:40,882
Yeah, well, you will have problems
if you touch his hair again.

560
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:43,009
LOL: I'm really sorry.
- Who's woody?

561
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,053

563
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:49,390
It's erm...

564
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:53,436
I just wanted to thank you. He said he's
being bullied and you'd helped him out.

565
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:56,397
- You're welcome.
- Yeah, I really appreciate that.

566
00:30:56,439 --> 00:31:00,109
And the clothes and stuff.
I think he likes 'em. I dort mind that, at all.

567
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:01,945
But the hair is not good.

568
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:03,404
I'm really sorry.

569
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:07,158
I am. I wouldrt have done it
if I knew you didn't like it.

570
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,661
Listen, I'm gonna leave him here with you.

571
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,871
I'm gonna trust you, Shaun.

572
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:13,498
All right? Give us a kiss.

573
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:17,919
- See you later. Nice to meet you.
WOOD Y: What's your name, love?

574
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:20,046

578
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:27,220
You idiot!

579
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:29,764
You shit yourself.

580
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:30,807
What?

581
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:33,309
- You shit yourself. You did.
- I didn't shit myself.

582
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:36,229
(Thud of stere0)

583
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,773
Hey, here he is!

584
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:41,484
- Where have you been?
- I've been getting a drink.

585
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:44,696
- You've been gone an hour.
- Look how pissed he is. Babycham?

586
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,531
Have you had it through a straw?

587
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:48,491
Wakey-wakey!

588
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,660
Pissed as a fart. Look at him.

589
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:55,665
You fancy Smell, dort you?

590
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:57,000

591
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,376

592
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:02,338
Listen, I think, Shaun...
I think you've got a great chance.

593
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,716
- Oh, aye, love.
- You ain't got nothing to lose.

594
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,467
- goon.
- She can only say no, mate.

595
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:08,511
You wanna give it a crack?

596
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:10,513
This can be a beautiful thing.

597
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:12,682
- Oh, my God. Fuckir hell.

598
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:14,684
That might be the perfect height.

600
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:18,354

(Pukey snorts)

602
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:22,483
You are, you're a little sweetheart.

LOL: I toId you. It's making me emotional.

604
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:27,280
SHAUN: Ladies first.

You're a real charmer, you are.

612
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,388
SHAUN: Careful.

616
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,732

In Germany?

678
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:33,550
Why did you go to Germany?

679
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:35,093
I was...

681
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:40,348
What did you do in Germany

682
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,975
Just kissed her.

683
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:44,227
Did you? Was she pretty?

684
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:47,647

688
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:01,119
We'll leave it today.

689
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:15,925
You might look about four,
but you kiss like a forty-year-old.

690
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:17,969
You're dead sensitive.

691
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:20,805
Are you all right?

692
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:23,975
Are you sure?

693
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:26,978
do you want me to kiss you again?

694
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:44,579
do you wanna suck my tits?

695
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:47,624
- Tell 'em a story.
- All right, if yous are making me.

696
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,960
All right, it took a little bit of time.

697
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:53,546
- But we did end up running things.
- We certainly did.

698
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:56,716
I mean, it's just...
I mean, for three weeks, right,

699
00:36:56,758 --> 00:36:59,135
this fucking wog...

700
00:36:59,177 --> 00:37:01,763
Right? Proper horrible.

701
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:05,183
sorry, mate, sorry.

702
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:07,435
Didrt mean nothing by it.

703
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:10,230
You know, just slip of the tongue, like.

704
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:12,857
sorry. This, you know, this brown gentleman...

705
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,861
...who... he was a bully,
he was a horrible bully.

706
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:19,280
no matter what colour he was,
he was a bully.

707
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:21,324
- And I hate bullies. dort I, wood?
- Yeah.

708
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:23,701
I can't stand them, man.
I can't stand 'em.

709
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:27,205
But for three weeks, right,
this fella was robbing my pudding.

710
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:29,082
What kind of pudding was it?

711
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:31,125
doesrt matter what pudding it was.

712
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:32,919
The pudding's not the polnt.

713
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:36,297
The polnt is,
he was taking my pudding off me.

714
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:39,133
And I just thought,
"Nah, I'm not having it. I dort care.

715
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:41,427
You're not getting my pudding,
that's it."

716
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:44,764
so, I grabbed it and I've gone,
"no, mate, no, you're not having it."

717
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:46,391
He was like...

718
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:48,560
(Mimics his accent): "White boy...

719
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,687
Give me your pud-pud."

720
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:55,567
Proper! do you know what I mean?
And I've just thought, "no, man."

721
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:57,777
- (Laughter)
COMBO: Nah, he did, right.

722
00:37:57,819 --> 00:37:59,821
ALL: Eh!

723
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:03,408
WOOD Y: Look at t'moosh on him.
- Smell his finger.

724
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:07,829
And who's been bloody smooching?

725
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:10,665
Come here, Shaun! Come on, man.

726
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:14,586
I've got someone I want you to meet.
Come and stand here.

727
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:17,505
now, listen to me.
This is a very special friend of mine.

728
00:38:17,547 --> 00:38:19,132
Combo, Shaun.

729
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:20,675
Newest recruit.

730
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:22,218
Shaun. Combo.

731
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,803
What are you doing?

732
00:38:23,845 --> 00:38:25,930
Just want to shake your hand.

733
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:27,557
Did you?

734
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:33,021
Are you a proper little skinead,
then, yeah?

735
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:34,939
Yeah.

736
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:39,235
You look like a little Action Man.

737
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:43,198
Like a little Barbie doII.
You're dressed up ar all that. Look.

738
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,741
What?

739
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:50,747
I'm only messing with you, you little fucker.

740
00:38:50,788 --> 00:38:52,790
I'm only messing with you.

741
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:55,293
GADGET: He's all right.
- You're all right.

742
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:58,254
Nice one, lad.
Sit down, anyway, I'm telling a story.

743
00:38:58,296 --> 00:38:59,756
Sit next to Milky.

744
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:05,762
Anyway, where was I?
What... Where was I?

745
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:08,848
You were on about that er...
"brown gentleman"

746
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,683
stealing your "pud-pud".

747
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:14,646
That's right, yeah. Yeah.
so, I've said, "no, you're not having it."

748
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:17,857
This one day, right,
I've been grafting all morning,

749
00:39:17,899 --> 00:39:21,194
just shovelling shit, constantly,
all morning, non-stop.

750
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:22,987
Werert I? And I'm fucking starving.

751
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:24,447
# Gentle piano

752
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:26,241
You know, like that proper hunger.

753
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:30,411
And I'm thinking, "Right, just eat my pudding,
just go and eat my pudding."

754
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:33,498
I've just finished
the last fucking mouthful and then,

755
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,751
this big, black, sweaty hand

756
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:39,587
has just gone wallop, right in my pudding.

757
00:39:39,629 --> 00:39:41,422
do you know what I mean?

758
00:39:41,464 --> 00:39:45,593
Proper big cigar fingers,
all over my fucking crumble and custard...

759
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:49,013
I just thought,
"no, I'm not having it, I dort care.

760
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:51,849
You're not getting my pudding, that's it."

761
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:55,645
I just took his hand out and just looked
him right in the face and I've gone...

762
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:02,652
(Piano music drowns speech)

763
00:40:05,738 --> 00:40:06,823
(Mouths): woody.

764
00:40:33,057 --> 00:40:35,268
so, last night was good fun, werert it?

765
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,688
- dort start.
- I'm just saying, a really good night.

766
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,941
I know what sort of a bloody night it was.
It were awkward.

767
00:40:41,983 --> 00:40:44,652
It was er... a little on the tense side.

768
00:40:44,694 --> 00:40:46,696
I know, mate, I'm sorry.

769
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:50,158
I knew he'd do it. I knew he'd have to
throw his bloody weight around.

770
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,826
Has to be number one.

771
00:40:51,868 --> 00:40:55,205
He were like that before he went in.
nowt's frigging changed, at all.

772
00:40:55,288 --> 00:40:57,790
Hang on. Wait.
He hardly did anything wrong, anyway.

773
00:40:57,832 --> 00:41:00,210
- I thought he was all right.
- I've got an idea.

774
00:41:00,293 --> 00:41:03,463
How about you climb out of his arse
for five minutes, Puke, eh?

775
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:05,590
Trust you to fucking jump on his dick.

776
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:08,426
I'm not. I'm just saying,
he was just telling a story.

777
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:10,470
You asked for a story, he toId it you.

778
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:12,931
I'll tell you a story
if you dort shut your mouth.

779
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:19,312
All right, boys?

780
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:21,439
- You all right, Combo?
- All right, Gadge.

781
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:23,316
- Puke.
- All right, mate.

782
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:25,610
WOOD Y: 'Ey up. What's up?

783
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:28,738
- Can I just have a little word with you?
- I've got a brew coming.

784
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,324

00:41:37,705 --> 00:41:39,207
All right, lad?

788
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:43,002
I said, "All right?"

789
00:41:43,044 --> 00:41:45,880
What was that for? That hurt!

790
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:48,925
- woody, hurry up.
- I will, love, yeah.

791
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,473
Milky, I'd watch it.
I think summat's gonna kick off.

792
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:57,850
MILKY: dort worry. I'm more than ready.

793
00:41:57,892 --> 00:42:00,353
You're making a big deal
out of nothing, anyway.

794
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:01,854
- He's all right.
- He's not.

795
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:02,897
Kel!

796
00:42:02,939 --> 00:42:04,983
MILKY: Kelly, you dort even know him.

797
00:42:05,024 --> 00:42:06,025
(Sighs)

798
00:42:08,236 --> 00:42:10,363
- What's up?
PUKEY: You all right, woods?

799
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:12,407
All right, lad.

800
00:42:15,493 --> 00:42:18,037

- We've to...

801
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,248
We've to bob round tomorrow morning.

802
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:43,438
I tell you, I shouldrt be here, you know.
This dort feel good, at all.

803
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:46,900
Look at the size of that brew.
Who drinks a brew that big?

804
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:56,868
I bet you all thought I was a right fucking
horrible, horrible, horrible

805
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,078

806
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,080
- A little bit.
- A bit?

807
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:04,125
Tell the truth, wood, man.
I was fucking horrible, werert I?

808
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:05,919
- A bit of a bastard, man.
- Yeah.

809
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,962
Yeah, well, you were a snake.

810
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:12,133
You were a fucking serpent
from the Bible, werert you?

811
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:16,554
do you wanna know why, wood?
do you want me to tell you why?

812
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:17,639
Yeah?

813
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,934
Cos see that man, there, Milky?

814
00:43:21,935 --> 00:43:23,436
That man there

815
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:25,104
took abuse off me.

816
00:43:26,147 --> 00:43:29,275
And I said some horrible things, Milk,
and I'm fucking sorry.

817
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:32,028
You let me abuse him.

818
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:34,781
And what did you do?
What did you do, wood?

819
00:43:34,822 --> 00:43:37,116
- I didn't do anything.
- I can't hear you.

820
00:43:37,158 --> 00:43:40,119
- I didn't do nothing.
- Exactly. nothing. Fuck all.

821
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:41,746
Neither did any of yous.

822
00:43:41,788 --> 00:43:45,083
not one of yous stood up
and made yourself count for that man there.

823
00:43:45,124 --> 00:43:47,335
And that was fucking wrong.

824
00:43:48,336 --> 00:43:52,131
Milk, honest to God,
I'm really glad you came here today.

825
00:43:52,173 --> 00:43:54,300
And I mean that, mate,
I really mean that.

826
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:58,471
Cos I've got one question to ask you.
Just one question.

827
00:43:58,513 --> 00:44:03,351
When you've heard it, if you want to leave,
you can leave, that's fine by me.

828
00:44:03,393 --> 00:44:05,395
But I've got one question to ask you.

829
00:44:05,436 --> 00:44:07,480
do you consider yourself

830
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:09,315
English or Jamaican?

831
00:44:09,357 --> 00:44:11,442
(Clock ticks)

832
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:23,997
English.

833
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:35,174
Lovely. I love you for that.
That's fucking great. I'm proud, man.

834
00:44:35,216 --> 00:44:37,719
Learn from him.
That's a proud man, there.

835
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:42,015
That's what we need, man.

836
00:44:42,056 --> 00:44:44,434
That's what this nation
has been built on.

837
00:44:44,517 --> 00:44:47,687
Proud men. Proud fucking warriors.

838
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:51,733
Two thousand years,
this little tiny fucking island

839
00:44:51,774 --> 00:44:53,985
has been raped and pillaged

840
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:57,030
by people who have come here
and wanted a piece of it.

841
00:44:57,071 --> 00:45:00,658
Two fucking world wars,
men have laid down their lives for this.

842
00:45:01,659 --> 00:45:03,703
For this, and for what?

843
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:06,331
so we can stick our fucking flag
in the ground and say,

844
00:45:06,372 --> 00:45:08,082
"Yeah, this is England

845
00:45:08,124 --> 00:45:09,709
and this is England

846
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:11,336
and this is England."

847
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,423
And for what?

848
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:17,508
For what now?

849
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,552
Eh, what for?

850
00:45:20,553 --> 00:45:23,848
so we can just open the fucking floodgates
and let them all come in?

851
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,767
And say, "Yeah, come on, come in.

852
00:45:25,808 --> 00:45:28,895
Get off your ship. Did you have
a safe journey? Was it hard?

853
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:31,773
Here y'are, here's a corner,
why dort you build a shop?

854
00:45:31,814 --> 00:45:35,235
Better still, why dort you build a shop
and then build a church?

855
00:45:35,276 --> 00:45:38,238
Follow your own fucking religions.
do what you want."

856
00:45:38,279 --> 00:45:42,492
When there's single fucking parents
out there, who can't get a fucking flat

857
00:45:42,534 --> 00:45:44,577
and they're being given to these...

858
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:47,872
And I'm gonna say it,
cos you're gonna have to fucking hear it.

859
00:45:47,914 --> 00:45:51,376
We're giving the flats
to these fucking Pakis. Right?

860
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:55,713
Who've got 50 and 60
in a fucking flat on their own.

861
00:45:55,797 --> 00:45:58,049
Right? We're giving that to them.

862
00:45:58,091 --> 00:46:01,177
There's three and a half million
unemployed out there.

863
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:04,597
Three and a half million of us,
who can't find fucking work.

864
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:07,809
Cos they're taking them all.
Cos it's fucking cheap labour.

865
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:09,435
Cheap and easy labour.

866
00:46:09,477 --> 00:46:12,897
Fucking cheap and easy,
which makes us cheap and easy.

867
00:46:12,939 --> 00:46:15,233
Three and a half fucking million!

868
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:17,735
It's not a j0ke. It's not a fucking j0ke.

869
00:46:17,777 --> 00:46:21,781
And that Thatcher sits there
in her fucking ivory tower

870
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:24,450
and sends us on a fucking phoney war!

871
00:46:24,492 --> 00:46:25,869
The Falklands?

872
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:27,704
The fucking Falklands?

873
00:46:27,745 --> 00:46:29,747
What the fuck's The Falklands?

874
00:46:29,831 --> 00:46:32,792
Fucking innocent men,
good fucking strong men.

875
00:46:32,834 --> 00:46:36,004
Good soIdiers,
real people losing their lives,

876
00:46:36,045 --> 00:46:39,090
going over there thinking
they're fighting for a fucking cause.

877
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:41,926
What are they fighting for?
What are they fighting against?

878
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:44,262
Fucking shepherds!
Shepherds with fucking...

879
00:46:44,304 --> 00:46:46,306
Shut up about The Falklands.

880
00:46:46,347 --> 00:46:47,932
- Why?
- Cos I want you to.

881
00:46:47,974 --> 00:46:50,977
There's fucking loads of dickheads dying
out there for nothing.

882
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:53,229
My fucking dad werert a dickhead!

883
00:46:53,271 --> 00:46:54,564
What are you doing?

884
00:46:54,647 --> 00:46:56,649
- Fuck off! Shut up!
- What am I doing wrong?

885
00:46:56,691 --> 00:46:59,110
Whoa, there, little one.
What's wrong, mate?

886
00:46:59,152 --> 00:47:01,696
- Tell me the truth. Come on.
- I just fucking...

887
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:03,198
That's it. goon.

888
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:05,241
My fucking dad died in that war!

889
00:47:05,283 --> 00:47:07,285
- Your dad died?
- Yeah. Get off!

890
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:11,331
- Fucking hell, mate, I'm sorry.
- Fucking shut up about it!

891
00:47:11,372 --> 00:47:12,832
I'm sorry, mate.

892
00:47:12,874 --> 00:47:14,709
Fucking hell, I'm sorry, lad.

893
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:17,670
I'm sorry. I never knew he died, man.

894
00:47:17,712 --> 00:47:19,130
Fucking hell.

895
00:47:19,172 --> 00:47:21,174
Oh, look, mate, if I'd have known,

896
00:47:21,216 --> 00:47:24,761
honest, I wouldrt have said, man,
but what I'm telling you is the truth.

897
00:47:24,802 --> 00:47:27,931
I can't lie to you.
It's a pathetic war, man.

898
00:47:27,972 --> 00:47:31,267
And you want your dad's life
to mean something, dort you?

899
00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:33,686
And this breaks my fucking heart to say it.

900
00:47:33,728 --> 00:47:35,730
We shouldrt have been there.

901
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:38,691
She lied to us.
She lied to me. She lied to you.

902
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:41,236
But, most importantly, she lied to your dad.

903
00:47:41,277 --> 00:47:45,990
If you dort stand up and fight this fucking fight
that's going on on the streets,

904
00:47:46,032 --> 00:47:48,243
your dad died for nothing.

905
00:47:48,284 --> 00:47:50,078
He died for nothing.

906
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:52,247
You've got to carry it on, man, in here.

907
00:47:53,206 --> 00:47:57,001
In your little fucking heart,
you've got the pride of your dad, man.

908
00:48:00,755 --> 00:48:02,048
Fucking hell.

909
00:48:03,424 --> 00:48:06,761
That little fucking whippersnapper
has set the standard.

910
00:48:07,762 --> 00:48:10,723
- Can you believe that, Banj?
- You can't, can you, at that age?

911
00:48:10,765 --> 00:48:12,058
Fucking hell.

912
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,560
What a gem.

913
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:15,395
What a fucking gem.

914
00:48:15,436 --> 00:48:16,938
All right, look.

915
00:48:26,364 --> 00:48:28,366
There's the line, boys.

916
00:48:28,408 --> 00:48:31,202
That means
you're all quite welcome to just leave

917
00:48:31,244 --> 00:48:34,539
and leave now and never come back
and that's it, the end of it.

918
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,333
But if you wanna stay,

919
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,168
this is a proper fight.

920
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:43,047
now yous all either cross that line
and go your merry little way...

921
00:48:44,048 --> 00:48:46,885
...or you stay where you are
and you come with me.

922
00:48:46,968 --> 00:48:48,845
The choice is yours, boys.

923
00:48:50,972 --> 00:48:53,266
Fucking hell!
That was a bit quick, werert it?

924
00:48:53,308 --> 00:48:55,768
I ain't being fucking brainwashed, Combo.

925
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:58,229
Oh, listen to fucking Sigmund Vold there.

926
00:48:58,271 --> 00:49:01,441
You're well out of line.
Well out of line, man.

927
00:49:01,482 --> 00:49:03,484
Come on, lads, let's have you.

928
00:49:03,568 --> 00:49:04,819
Come on, then.

929
00:49:04,861 --> 00:49:06,362
Come on, Puke, mate.

930
00:49:06,404 --> 00:49:08,198
Sit down.

931
00:49:09,282 --> 00:49:11,034
You what?

932
00:49:11,075 --> 00:49:13,077
Kes, just sit down.

933
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:17,373
no. no, you can't be serious, mate.
We'll talk about this outside.

934
00:49:17,415 --> 00:49:19,083
Kes, just sit down.

935
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:21,628
Puke, man, fucking come.
What you on about?

936
00:49:21,669 --> 00:49:23,421
Look, he's fucking right.

937
00:49:24,422 --> 00:49:26,424
What can I do, man? Are you coming?

938
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:27,258
no.

939
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,887
- Gadge, come on, Tubs, man.
- Fuck off calling me Tubs!

940
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:32,555
I'm sick of you, woody.

941
00:49:32,597 --> 00:49:35,642
This is why I'm staying,
because you're always taking the piss,

942
00:49:35,683 --> 00:49:37,685
making me feel that fucking big.

943
00:49:37,727 --> 00:49:39,729
He's put things into perspective.

944
00:49:40,605 --> 00:49:43,691
Look at the other night.
You didn't step up once then.

945
00:49:49,322 --> 00:49:50,823
Joln me.

946
00:49:56,287 --> 00:49:58,998
Milky, man,
I know I let you down the other night,

947
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,544
but I swear to you
I'll never fucking do it again. Look at me.

948
00:50:02,627 --> 00:50:05,547
I'd never do it again.
I swear to God I wouldrt, man.

949
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:10,134
You're my br0, man. What the fuck?

950
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:23,982
Come on, mate.

951
00:50:24,065 --> 00:50:25,525
(Combo tuts)

952
00:50:31,072 --> 00:50:33,533
WOOD Y: Shaun? Come on, man. We're off.

953
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:35,618
LOL: Come on, Shaun.
- no.

954
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,954
Shaun, man, you can't fucking stay here.

955
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:39,163
Shaun?

956
00:50:40,164 --> 00:50:44,002
He's just a kid. The things you've said
have made him want to stay.

957
00:50:44,043 --> 00:50:46,254
woody, I wanna make my dad proud.

958
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:47,755
Listen, love...

959
00:50:47,797 --> 00:50:49,591
See you later, mate.

960
00:50:49,674 --> 00:50:51,676
See you later, Lol, love.

961
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:53,720
He's 12. I can't leave him here.

962
00:50:53,761 --> 00:50:56,180
- go.
- nothing we can do if he wants to stay.

963
00:50:56,222 --> 00:50:58,474
You fucking look after him, do you hear me?

964
00:50:58,516 --> 00:51:01,019
He can look after himself. He's proved that.

965
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,562
COMBO: See yous later.

966
00:51:02,604 --> 00:51:04,606
Come on, love.

967
00:51:04,647 --> 00:51:06,691
Come on, now.

968
00:51:13,948 --> 00:51:15,575
See you later, mate.

969
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:22,582
dort forget, you've got a snake
in the grass with you there.

970
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:24,334
You're a good man.

971
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:26,377
A brave good man, man.

972
00:51:27,378 --> 00:51:29,088
A really good man.

973
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:32,967
A cup of tea for the boys there, Banj.
Few Pot noodles or something.

974
00:51:33,009 --> 00:51:35,762
I'm fucking gagging for a shit, me,
I'm telling you.

975
00:51:54,656 --> 00:51:56,282
dort worry about it.

976
00:51:57,283 --> 00:51:59,285
I'll have a word with woody.

977
00:51:59,327 --> 00:52:01,329
I'll sort it, I promise you.

978
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:02,956
I just feel really bad.

979
00:52:02,997 --> 00:52:04,958
He looked gutted, Combo.

980
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:07,252
I know, I feel bad, as well, but...

981
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:09,295
Oh, fucking hell, let's face it.

982
00:52:09,337 --> 00:52:11,339
woody's not like me and you.

983
00:52:13,216 --> 00:52:15,969
no, he's fucking certainly not like you.

984
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:18,972
no-one's ever fucking took a swing at me
like that.

985
00:52:19,013 --> 00:52:20,765
- Really?
- Honest.

986
00:52:20,807 --> 00:52:21,849
Honest.

987
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:24,602
It's like looking in the mirror.

988
00:52:25,353 --> 00:52:27,897
20 years ago, when I was fucking 12,

989
00:52:27,939 --> 00:52:29,983
taking swings at big men.

990
00:52:30,024 --> 00:52:33,403
I dort know, I just dort like
people speaking about my dad,

991
00:52:33,444 --> 00:52:35,238
even in a nice way.

992
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,991
I dort even like people
speaking about the war.

993
00:52:40,118 --> 00:52:42,120
You loved him, didn't you?

994
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:46,082
Yeah.

995
00:52:49,043 --> 00:52:50,670
And then you lost him.

996
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:56,217
(Whispers): Yeah.

997
00:52:58,595 --> 00:53:00,221
I know what it's like.

998
00:53:01,598 --> 00:53:03,600
to have people walk out on you.

999
00:53:03,641 --> 00:53:06,227
to have people just fucking leave you.

1000
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:11,858
Honest, lad, I know how you feel.

1001
00:53:13,067 --> 00:53:15,069
If you ever want anyone to talk to...

1002
00:53:16,487 --> 00:53:18,281
...someone to cry with

1003
00:53:18,323 --> 00:53:20,617
or just to fucking have a hug

1004
00:53:20,658 --> 00:53:22,660
or punch the fuck out of 'em,

1005
00:53:22,702 --> 00:53:24,871
I'm telling you, I'll be there for you.

1006
00:53:24,913 --> 00:53:26,915
I wort turn my back on you.

1007
00:53:28,082 --> 00:53:29,876
I promise you that.

1008
00:53:34,255 --> 00:53:35,298
Spit.

1009
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:39,677
That's a mars handshake, that.

1010
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:41,179
I promise you.

1011
00:53:42,096 --> 00:53:44,432
I wort let you down.

1012
00:53:44,474 --> 00:53:47,727
# soIdiers of Islam
are loading their guns

1013
00:53:47,769 --> 00:53:49,771
# They're getting ready

1014
00:53:51,064 --> 00:53:54,651
# But the Russian tanks
are mowing them down

1015
00:53:54,692 --> 00:53:56,486
# They're getting ready

1016
00:53:58,363 --> 00:54:02,534
# There's children in Africa
with tommy guns

1017
00:54:02,575 --> 00:54:04,160
# Getting ready

1018
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:08,998
# While the Islam armies
are beckoning on

1019
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,084
# They're getting ready

1020
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,462
# There's a burning sun

1021
00:54:14,504 --> 00:54:17,966
# And it sets in the Western world

1022
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:21,219
# But it rises in the East

1023
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:25,682
# And pretty soon
it's gonna burn your temples down

1024
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:29,769
# While the heads of state
are having their fun

1025
00:54:30,562 --> 00:54:32,146
# Are they ready?

1026
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:37,402
# We're looking at the world
through the barrel of a gun

1027
00:54:37,443 --> 00:54:39,153
# Are we ready?

1028
00:54:40,488 --> 00:54:44,325
# And you stand there
beating on your little war drum

1029
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:46,160
# Are you ready...

1030
00:54:48,496 --> 00:54:49,956
(dog barks)

1031
00:54:49,998 --> 00:54:53,418
- Look at the size of that dog.
- Gadge, have a look at that dog.

1032
00:54:53,459 --> 00:54:55,628
- Just get on with it.
(Growls)

1033
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:58,047
Excuse me, mate,
is there a toilet here?

1034
00:54:59,048 --> 00:55:01,050
Ah, my arse is killing.

1035
00:55:02,594 --> 00:55:04,596
- All right, boss?
- Round the back.

1036
00:55:04,637 --> 00:55:06,639
- Round the back.
- Cheers, boss.

1037
00:55:08,308 --> 00:55:10,310
(Chatter)

1038
00:55:14,898 --> 00:55:17,901
I am hungry, yeah.
There should be a barbecue or something.

1039
00:55:17,942 --> 00:55:19,569
Buffet food...

1040
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:22,363
All right, look, yous three,

1041
00:55:22,405 --> 00:55:24,866
yous three, I want yous on your best behaviour.

1042
00:55:24,908 --> 00:55:26,993
Right? Your fucking best behaviour.

1043
00:55:28,286 --> 00:55:30,288
SHAUN: Ooh, he's got a nice car!

1044
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:33,750
Nice car.

1045
00:55:34,834 --> 00:55:37,045
Here they are.
Wait there. hoId it back, lads.

1046
00:55:37,086 --> 00:55:39,088
- Just wait there.
- Come on.

1047
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:41,674
Just wait there.
Behave yourself. Wait there.

1048
00:55:41,716 --> 00:55:43,176
ARTHUR: You all right?

1049
00:55:44,636 --> 00:55:46,679
How are you, Arthur? Good to see you.

1050
00:55:46,721 --> 00:55:48,514
All right, Lenny, mate.

1051
00:55:48,556 --> 00:55:50,558
All right? A pleasure. A pleasure.

1052
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,060
SHAUN: All right, mate.

1053
00:55:53,144 --> 00:55:56,523
LENNY: Gentlemen, there is a forgotten word.

1054
00:55:56,564 --> 00:55:57,815
no.

1055
00:55:57,857 --> 00:55:59,609
An almost forbidden word.

1056
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:03,029
A word that means more to me
than any other.

1057
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:05,907
That word is "England".

1058
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:07,325
MEN: Yes!

1059
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:17,043
Once, we flaunted it in the face of the world,
like a banner.

1060
00:56:17,085 --> 00:56:19,087
It was a word that stood for power.

1061
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:22,382
A word that stood for freedom.

1062
00:56:22,423 --> 00:56:24,425
A word that stood for respect.

1063
00:56:25,426 --> 00:56:26,928
But today,

1064
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:30,431
we're scarcely even allowed
to speak the name of our country.

1065
00:56:30,473 --> 00:56:31,975
Gadge, are you honestly...

1066
00:56:32,016 --> 00:56:35,311
Well, I want to revive that word,
a grand old word,

1067
00:56:35,353 --> 00:56:37,355
the word "Englishman".

1068
00:56:37,397 --> 00:56:38,565
ALL: Yes! Yes!

1069
00:56:38,606 --> 00:56:39,607
Yes!

1070
00:56:42,193 --> 00:56:44,195
now we've been marginalised.

1071
00:56:44,237 --> 00:56:46,239
We've been called "cranks".

1072
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:48,116
We're not cranks.

1073
00:56:48,157 --> 00:56:50,368
some people say we're racists.

1074
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,662
We're not racists. We're realists.

1075
00:56:52,704 --> 00:56:55,164
some people call us Nazis.

1076
00:56:55,206 --> 00:56:57,208
We're not Nazis.

1077
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:00,378
no, what we are, we are nationalists.

1078
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:04,215
And there's a reason
people try to pigeonole us like this.

1079
00:57:04,257 --> 00:57:07,135
And that is because of one word, gentlemen.

1080
00:57:07,176 --> 00:57:09,178
- Fear.
ALL: Yeah.

1081
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,805
They fear us.

1082
00:57:10,847 --> 00:57:14,809
They fear us because we are the true volce
of the people of this country.

1083
00:57:14,851 --> 00:57:16,686
- Yes!
COMBO: Yes, Lenny.

1084
00:57:16,728 --> 00:57:18,771
People who work hard,

1085
00:57:18,813 --> 00:57:20,481
pay their way,

1086
00:57:20,523 --> 00:57:23,234
it dort matter
what their ethnic background is,

1087
00:57:23,276 --> 00:57:25,612
I welcome with open arms in this country.

1088
00:57:25,653 --> 00:57:28,364
It's the people who think
we owe them a living.

1089
00:57:28,406 --> 00:57:31,409
These are the people that need to go back.

1090
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:33,244
ALL: Yes!

1091
00:57:33,286 --> 00:57:34,871
Send them back!

1092
00:57:34,913 --> 00:57:37,457
- Send the bastards back!
- Send them back!

1093
00:57:37,498 --> 00:57:38,875
Send them back!

1094
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:41,294
An English king on a battlefield once said,

1095
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:45,173
"From this day till the end of the world,
only we in it shall be remembered,

1096
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:48,927
we few, we happy few,
we band of brothers."

1097
00:57:48,968 --> 00:57:51,387
Gentlemen, it is the time to stand up
and be counted.

1098
00:57:51,429 --> 00:57:54,015
ALL: Yes!
- It is the time for action.

1099
00:57:54,057 --> 00:57:57,018
Our country has been stolen
from under our noses.

1100
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,603
ALL: Yes!

1101
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:01,105
Well, gentlemen,
it's time to take it back!

1102
00:58:01,147 --> 00:58:02,357
Yes!

1103
00:58:02,398 --> 00:58:04,692
Yes! goon, Lenny! goon, Lenny!

1104
00:58:04,734 --> 00:58:07,195
Are you ready to return to the fight?

1105
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:08,279
ALL: Yes!

1106
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:10,907
- Are you ready to shed blood?
ALL: Yes!

1107
00:58:10,949 --> 00:58:14,077
Are you ready to fight for this country
with your last breath of life?

1108
00:58:14,118 --> 00:58:15,286
ALL: Yes!

1109
00:58:15,328 --> 00:58:17,539
(AII chant): Lenny! Lenny! Lenny!

1110
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:19,040
Lenny! Lenny...

1111
00:58:19,082 --> 00:58:22,544
Gentlemen, joln our band of brothers.

1112
00:58:22,585 --> 00:58:24,546
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1113
00:58:24,587 --> 00:58:25,630
Yes!

1114
00:58:25,672 --> 00:58:28,299
I'm going to have a word with Lenny.
Yous wait here.

1115
00:58:28,341 --> 00:58:30,885
- Amazing that.
- You're dead right.

1116
00:58:34,597 --> 00:58:37,058
PUKEY: Fucking, Gadge.
- What?

1117
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,102
do you not feel bad about woody?

1118
00:58:39,143 --> 00:58:41,813
What do you mean,
do I not feel bad about him? Look.

1119
00:58:41,896 --> 00:58:43,898
Look at all these people in here.

1120
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,525
This is right.

1121
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:48,278
If it wasrt right,
all these wouldrt be here.

1122
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:50,363
- Think about...
- I'm not saying that.

1123
00:58:50,405 --> 00:58:53,074
do you not feel bad
about just leaving him like that?

1124
00:58:53,116 --> 00:58:55,577
- He's been our mate for...
- We've not left him.

1125
00:58:55,618 --> 00:58:57,203
I'm still his friend.

1126
00:58:58,913 --> 00:59:00,164
MEGGY: Comb...

1127
00:59:00,206 --> 00:59:03,960
You know, you're supposed to have
a qualified driver in the front.

1128
00:59:05,962 --> 00:59:07,922
Are you gonna fucking report me?

1129
00:59:07,964 --> 00:59:09,591
Well, it's illegal.

1130
00:59:12,051 --> 00:59:14,554
We're really squashed in the back here.

1131
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:17,932
Can one of us come up the front?

1132
00:59:25,481 --> 00:59:27,567
Shall we show him?
Shall we show him?

1133
00:59:31,154 --> 00:59:32,780
dort look, Comb.

1134
00:59:32,822 --> 00:59:34,407
What is it, lad?

1135
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:39,996
(Chuckles)

1136
00:59:40,038 --> 00:59:41,623
Fuck off!

1137
00:59:41,664 --> 00:59:44,083
That's my fucking boy! Look at that.

1138
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:47,837
That's why he's in the fucking front,
Meggy, you fucking gobshite.

1139
00:59:47,879 --> 00:59:50,632
- do you like it?
- It's fucking brilliant, that.

1140
00:59:50,673 --> 00:59:52,091
Fucking brilliant.

1141
00:59:52,175 --> 00:59:54,510
do you reckon Lenny'll mind
that we nicked it?

1142
00:59:54,552 --> 00:59:58,473
no, will he fuck. That's going in
the middle of the wall, back in the flat.

1143
00:59:58,514 --> 01:00:00,517
We'll build all our stuff round that.

1144
01:00:00,558 --> 01:00:03,561
That's gonna be our fucking centrepiece.
That's the focus.

1145
01:00:04,979 --> 01:00:06,981
- Glad you like it.
- Nice one, son.

1146
01:00:07,023 --> 01:00:08,983
MEGGY: What's it called, that flag?

1147
01:00:09,025 --> 01:00:11,319
St George's Cross, isn't it, Combo?

1148
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:14,405
Yeah. St fucking George's Cross.

1149
01:00:15,406 --> 01:00:17,408
You all right there, Pukes, lad?

1150
01:00:19,035 --> 01:00:21,037
Yeah, I am. I was thinking, mate.

1151
01:00:21,079 --> 01:00:23,081
You seem a bit quiet, lad.

1152
01:00:24,207 --> 01:00:25,583
Yeah.

1153
01:00:28,878 --> 01:00:30,838
You got a problem, then, or what?

1154
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,633
no, I've just got things on my mind, Combo.

1155
01:00:33,675 --> 01:00:35,134
Like what?

1156
01:00:37,053 --> 01:00:38,555
Well, like...

1157
01:00:39,597 --> 01:00:41,599
Well, can I ask you something?

1158
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:45,603
do you really believe
in all that shit, Combo?

1159
01:00:50,024 --> 01:00:51,693
GADGET: Fucking hell, Comb!

1160
01:00:51,734 --> 01:00:53,903
Oi, Gadge, come with me.
He's getting me out.

1161
01:00:53,945 --> 01:00:56,823
Open the fucking door!
Get fucking out now!

1162
01:00:56,865 --> 01:00:59,701
- Get fucking out!
- All right, all right, all right.

1163
01:00:59,742 --> 01:01:02,161
Out of the car.
Get out, you little fucking shitbag.

1164
01:01:02,245 --> 01:01:03,204
You...

1165
01:01:03,246 --> 01:01:05,248

- (Groans)

1166
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:10,545
...fucking ever, ever undermine me again
in front of my fucking troops.

1167
01:01:10,587 --> 01:01:12,589
do you understand me?

1168
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:14,841
do you understand me? Eh? Yeah?

1169
01:01:14,883 --> 01:01:18,136
now, fuck off back to woody,
you little fucking queer.

1170
01:01:18,177 --> 01:01:20,388
goon, fuck off! Fuck off!

1171
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:22,765
- You little queer.
- Oi, lads.

1172
01:01:23,766 --> 01:01:25,685
- Oi, Shaun, man, come.
- Leave him alone.

1173
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:27,729
- Oi, come out.
- sorry, mate.

1174
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:29,981
- I can't.
- Fuck off. Leave him alone. Walk!

1175
01:01:30,064 --> 01:01:31,649
- (Others scream)
- What the fuck?

1176
01:01:31,691 --> 01:01:33,776
Waaaah!

1177
01:02:12,023 --> 01:02:16,027
Right, this is where all the fucking Pakis
go to work in the chicken factory.

1178
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:18,905
- Fucking do it, boys.
- Can we go to the chicken factory?

1179
01:02:19,697 --> 01:02:21,908
- Just fucking do it.
- What shall I put?

1180
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:23,952
Anything. Put anything you want.

1181
01:02:34,462 --> 01:02:36,464
WOMAN: Fucking bastards!

1182
01:02:36,506 --> 01:02:40,343
dort fucking come back,
you fucking little whore!

1183
01:02:43,137 --> 01:02:45,139
- Fuck off.
(Combo chuckles)

1184
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:48,685
goon. On your own.

1185
01:02:48,768 --> 01:02:51,354
Yeah, fuck off, you Paki bastards!

1186
01:02:51,396 --> 01:02:53,022
- Fuck off.
- goon, son!

1187
01:02:54,023 --> 01:02:55,483
Hey-hey!

1188
01:02:57,193 --> 01:03:00,238
COMBO: Look at these
little fucking sewer rats. Look.

1189
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:02,866
Fucking vermin.

1190
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:05,201
Oi!

1191
01:03:13,751 --> 01:03:17,964
COMBO: now, that's our ball now.
Right? And we're playing here.

1192
01:03:18,006 --> 01:03:21,634
so, I suggest you take fucking
Tweedledum and Tweedledee

1193
01:03:21,676 --> 01:03:23,469

That fucking kid's dad died

Oh, no, it's nothing personal

1301
01:09:27,959 --> 01:09:29,794
I'm just gonna get off.

1302
01:09:29,836 --> 01:09:32,881
Come on, wood. Fucking hell,
I've brought bo0ze and everything.

1303
01:09:32,922 --> 01:09:34,382
Can't we bury the hatchet?

1304
01:09:34,424 --> 01:09:37,886
I know what you've come for, man.
I'd rather get off, like.

1305
01:09:37,927 --> 01:09:41,639
It's this thing on aardvarks,
I'm really eager to watch it.

1306
01:09:41,681 --> 01:09:45,059
Come on, then, let's have you.
Come on, let's have you, folks.

1307
01:09:45,101 --> 01:09:47,812
You have a good birthday, you,

1308
01:09:47,854 --> 01:09:49,772
sorry to be missioning it off.

1309
01:09:50,773 --> 01:09:52,317
Nice one, mate.

1310
01:09:52,358 --> 01:09:54,152
You look after yourself, you.

1311
01:09:54,194 --> 01:09:56,196

1312

01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,675
Happy birthday, Smell.

1319
01:10:17,717 --> 01:10:19,677
- Smell!
- What's that?

1320
01:10:19,719 --> 01:10:21,179
Porno?

1321
01:10:21,221 --> 01:10:23,473
What are you giving her porno for,
Meggy?

1322
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:25,850
She's a woman.
She's got her own nipples.

1323
01:10:25,892 --> 01:10:27,685
I thought she might like it.

1324
01:10:27,727 --> 01:10:29,521
Smell, are you ready?

1325
01:10:29,604 --> 01:10:31,189
The er... magicians.

1326
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:32,690
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

1327
01:10:32,732 --> 01:10:35,109

01:10:37,195 --> 01:10:39,197
- Alaka... Alakazam.

1330
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:40,698
Wahey!

1331
01:10:41,908 --> 01:10:43,910
Happy birthday, Smell.

1332
01:10:43,952 --> 01:10:45,537

1333
01:10:46,538 --> 01:10:48,581

01:10:48,623 --> 01:10:51,709

- Yeah, please.

1335
01:10:51,751 --> 01:10:55,463
- Here you are. Put that on the table.
- Cheers, love, thanks.

1336
01:10:55,505 --> 01:10:58,216
You dort mind us coming, do you, Smell?
It's just...

1337
01:10:58,258 --> 01:11:02,303
My little man, here, wanted to surprise you
on your birthday and all that.

1338
01:11:02,345 --> 01:11:03,930
Happy birthday, Smell.

1339
01:11:09,769 --> 01:11:11,771
do you think my party's going all right?

1340
01:11:11,855 --> 01:11:13,523
It's been all right, yeah.

1341
01:11:13,565 --> 01:11:15,567
Better if woody was here.

1342
01:11:15,608 --> 01:11:18,570
Yeah, I know, man.
I dort know why they left.

1343
01:11:18,611 --> 01:11:20,655
They just kind of got up and went.

1344
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:23,700
I dort think woody was standing
any of it from Combo.

1345
01:11:24,701 --> 01:11:28,454
I mean, I dort know what's going on
with those two,

1346
01:11:28,496 --> 01:11:30,456
but there's some real tension.

1347
01:11:30,498 --> 01:11:33,293
I can sense some real tension
between them.

1348
01:11:33,334 --> 01:11:35,336
Was you happy when you saw me?

1349
01:11:35,378 --> 01:11:36,671
Yeah.

1350
01:11:36,713 --> 01:11:38,882
I liked it when you gave me that cake.

1351
01:11:38,923 --> 01:11:40,717
I thought it was cool.

1352
01:11:40,758 --> 01:11:42,385
Did you make it?

1353
01:11:43,386 --> 01:11:44,387
Yeah.

1354
01:11:45,388 --> 01:11:47,348
- You didn't, did you?
- no.

1355
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:48,933
I didn't think you did.

1356
01:11:48,975 --> 01:11:51,269
Did you buy it?

1357
01:11:51,311 --> 01:11:53,146
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you bought it.

1358
01:11:54,772 --> 01:11:57,108
But what did you think to the other night?

1359
01:11:58,234 --> 01:12:00,195
Yeah.

1360
01:12:00,236 --> 01:12:03,615
do you know what I'm on about?
In the shed and stuff.

1361
01:12:03,698 --> 01:12:05,283
Yeah, that was...

1362
01:12:05,325 --> 01:12:07,118
It was all right, yeah.

1363
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,078
Did you not think much to it?

1364
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,538
Oh, yeah.

1365
01:12:11,623 --> 01:12:13,416
It was really nice.

1366
01:12:13,499 --> 01:12:16,294
You know when I asked you
to suck my tits and stuff,

1367
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,380
I just thought
that you werert that into it.

1368
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:23,051
I only didn't suck your tits
cos I've never done it before.

1369
01:12:23,092 --> 01:12:26,763
I thought you'd seen a pair of tits
in Germany or summat.

1370
01:12:26,804 --> 01:12:29,015
no, I've seen a pair of tits, but...

1371
01:12:29,057 --> 01:12:30,642
I didn't suck 'em.

1372
01:12:30,725 --> 01:12:31,768
Oh.

1373
01:12:33,978 --> 01:12:35,188
Right.

1374
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:39,484
That's why then, isn't it?
It's not cos you didn't want toor anything?

1375
01:12:39,526 --> 01:12:40,985
Yeah, I just...

1376
01:12:41,027 --> 01:12:43,947
Cos I bet you've had
loads of boys doing it and...

1377
01:12:44,906 --> 01:12:47,408
I felt a bit embarrassed
just in case I couldrt do it.

1378
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:48,451
Yeah.

1379
01:12:48,535 --> 01:12:51,162
not that many people have done it to me.

1380
01:12:51,204 --> 01:12:53,206
I just thought it'd be nice, like.

1381
01:12:53,248 --> 01:12:55,250
It'd make us feel closer and stuff.

1382
01:12:56,334 --> 01:12:57,794
I was...

1383
01:12:57,835 --> 01:12:59,587
meaning to ask you.

1384
01:13:01,339 --> 01:13:04,759
This might seem a bit daft,
but will you be my girlfriend?

1385
01:13:06,094 --> 01:13:07,762
Honestly?

1386
01:13:11,015 --> 01:13:13,059
Yeah, I'd love to be.

1387
01:13:13,101 --> 01:13:14,811
It'd be really nice.

1388
01:13:14,853 --> 01:13:18,648
Cos I've been thinking about it, as well,
but I didn't think you'd ever ask me.

1389
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:23,236
I thought it'd just be, like, a one time,
off in the shed or whatever.

1390
01:13:23,278 --> 01:13:25,029
Will you be all right for...

1391
01:13:25,071 --> 01:13:27,615
them lot to know,
if you're not embarrassed?

1392
01:13:28,616 --> 01:13:30,618
Cos I'm not embarrassed.

1393
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:32,245
I think you're lovely.

1394
01:13:38,626 --> 01:13:42,881
MARGARET THATCHER: To maintain peace,
with freedom and justice is always expensive.

1395
01:13:42,922 --> 01:13:46,426
It's less expensive than war,
particularly in human life.

1396
01:13:46,467 --> 01:13:50,263
Might there be a time when we talk
to the Argentines again?

1397
01:13:50,305 --> 01:13:53,141
No. Not on sovereignty.

1398
01:13:53,183 --> 01:13:56,019
One thing... the islanders
have made it perfectly clear,

1399
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:57,770
these islands are British.

1400
01:13:57,812 --> 01:14:00,565
They are the Queers loyal subjects.

1401
01:14:00,607 --> 01:14:02,609
They wish it to stay that way.

1402
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:05,862
At least the weather's been on
Mrs Thatcher's side...

1403
01:14:06,571 --> 01:14:08,573
(Factory hooter)

1404
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:11,951
(Sighs)

1405
01:14:15,288 --> 01:14:16,372
(Horn)

1406
01:14:16,414 --> 01:14:19,042
- Lol.
- For fuck's sake.

1407
01:14:19,083 --> 01:14:20,877
Where are you off? Court?

1408
01:14:20,919 --> 01:14:22,128
no. I...

1409
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:24,130
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to you.

1410
01:14:24,172 --> 01:14:26,341
- Well, I'm late for work.
- Just two minutes?

1411
01:14:26,382 --> 01:14:28,551
- I haven't got two minutes.
- All right, Lol?

1412
01:14:28,593 --> 01:14:30,386
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1413
01:14:30,428 --> 01:14:32,055
- Hi, Lol.
- Hiya.

1414
01:14:32,096 --> 01:14:33,973
For fu... I'm going to work.

1415
01:14:34,015 --> 01:14:37,060
- Please, Lol. Two minutes.
- What do you wanna talk to me about?

1416
01:14:37,101 --> 01:14:38,811
- Stuff.
- Stuff?

1417
01:14:38,853 --> 01:14:42,148
- You wanna talk to me about stuff?
- I just wanna have a chat with you.

1418
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:44,484
About the fact you've just
come out of prison?

1419
01:14:44,526 --> 01:14:47,570
You've ruined everything?
You've br0ken woody's fucking heart?

1420
01:14:47,612 --> 01:14:51,074
You wanna talk to me about stuff?
Well, I can't fucking wait. Let's go.

1421
01:14:51,115 --> 01:14:52,992
I want to talk about other stuff.

1422
01:14:53,034 --> 01:14:56,496
Other stuff? What other stuff
have you possibly got to say to me?

1423
01:14:56,538 --> 01:14:58,706
Could I just have fucking two minutes
with you?

1424
01:14:58,748 --> 01:15:01,793
no, I'm going to work.
I'm not your fucking counsellor, Combo.

1425
01:15:01,834 --> 01:15:04,963
- I'll come back at dinner time, then.
- no, dort come back.

1426
01:15:05,004 --> 01:15:06,923
I'll come to yours later on.

1427
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:09,300
to mine?
You can have two minutes now.

1428
01:15:09,342 --> 01:15:11,135
You've got two fucking minutes.

1429
01:15:11,177 --> 01:15:12,762
OK. Sound.

1430
01:15:25,066 --> 01:15:27,652
Come on, then. I'm late for work.

1431
01:15:32,574 --> 01:15:35,076
There's something for you
in the glove box.

1432
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:45,879
A box.

1433
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:49,883
You make this when you was in prison?

1434
01:15:49,924 --> 01:15:50,967
Yeah.

1435
01:15:53,469 --> 01:15:54,888
Thanks.

1436
01:15:59,267 --> 01:16:00,643
Lol...

1437
01:16:01,728 --> 01:16:02,729
Erm...

1438
01:16:05,273 --> 01:16:07,984
Since that night that we spent together,

1439
01:16:08,026 --> 01:16:10,195
before I went inside...

1440
01:16:11,196 --> 01:16:14,073
...I haven't been able to think about
anything else.

1441
01:16:15,283 --> 01:16:16,701
no, I haven't.

1442
01:16:16,743 --> 01:16:19,245
I haven't been able
to get you out of my mind, man.

1443
01:16:20,788 --> 01:16:22,790
And, to be honest with you, Lol...

1444
01:16:23,791 --> 01:16:25,627
...just thinking of you...

1445
01:16:26,711 --> 01:16:29,464
...got me through
them three and a half years inside.

1446
01:16:30,882 --> 01:16:32,300
I mean...

1447
01:16:33,301 --> 01:16:35,303
That was the best night of my life.

1448
01:16:37,305 --> 01:16:39,307
It was the worst night of my life.

1449
01:16:41,309 --> 01:16:42,602
Why?

1450
01:16:42,644 --> 01:16:46,314
I have done nothing but try and forget
about that night, Combo.

1451
01:16:48,816 --> 01:16:50,610
It was... It was beautiful.

1452
01:16:50,652 --> 01:16:52,278
no, I was 16.

1453
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,489
I was pissed off my head.

1454
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:57,325
It wasrt beautiful.

1455
01:17:00,954 --> 01:17:02,455
I love you, Lol.

1456
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:04,541
What?

1457
01:17:08,586 --> 01:17:09,879
I've...

1458
01:17:11,256 --> 01:17:13,049
I've always loved you.

1459
01:17:14,133 --> 01:17:16,135
It's never gonna happen, Combo.

1460
01:17:18,346 --> 01:17:20,348
(Factory hooter)

1461
01:17:25,395 --> 01:17:27,021
Are we done?

1462
01:17:27,063 --> 01:17:28,064
Yeah.

1463
01:17:32,485 --> 01:17:34,070
There's your box.

1464
01:17:38,324 --> 01:17:40,201
(Sighs)

1465
01:18:03,099 --> 01:18:04,726
(Thumps door)

1466
01:18:09,022 --> 01:18:11,149
# TOOTS AND THE MAYTALS:
Pressure Drop

1467
01:18:16,738 --> 01:18:18,364
# Pressure

1468
01:18:18,406 --> 01:18:20,116
# Oh, pressure

1469
01:18:20,158 --> 01:18:22,160
# Pressure's gonna drop on you

1470
01:18:22,202 --> 01:18:24,204
Why do they call you Smell?

1471
01:18:25,246 --> 01:18:28,708
It's kind of similar to Michelle,
if you think about it.

1472
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:31,753
I dort know, really,
if I'm being honest with you.

1473
01:18:31,794 --> 01:18:34,255
- Ah, that's fine.
- It's not cos I'm smelly.

1474
01:18:34,297 --> 01:18:36,716
It's just Michelle and Smell.

1475
01:18:36,758 --> 01:18:38,760
- Right.
- Purely cos it rhymes.

1476
01:18:38,801 --> 01:18:41,679
Well, it sort of rhymes, doesrt it?
does it rhyme?

1477
01:18:41,763 --> 01:18:43,223
MEGGY: R for Rectum.

1478
01:18:44,224 --> 01:18:45,600
Rabbit.

1479
01:18:46,601 --> 01:18:48,603
- Rub your rectum.
- (Sniggers)

1480
01:18:48,645 --> 01:18:51,231
- Oh, rabbit, you said, yeah?
- Yeah.

1481
01:18:51,272 --> 01:18:53,024
Furry rectum.

1482
01:18:53,066 --> 01:18:55,401
do you reckon
they've got a cassette player?

1483
01:18:56,402 --> 01:18:57,987
- Yeah, probably.
- Really?

1484
01:18:58,029 --> 01:19:00,031
- Yeah, probably.
- Oh, I hope so.

1485
01:19:00,073 --> 01:19:02,200
Let's bang some music into their ears.

1486
01:19:02,242 --> 01:19:03,826
That'll be good.

1487
01:19:08,373 --> 01:19:10,792
- Is this it?
- Yeah, I can walk straight in.

1488
01:19:11,459 --> 01:19:12,794
Combo!

1489
01:19:13,336 --> 01:19:14,587
(Pob giggles)

1490
01:19:14,629 --> 01:19:16,422
That was nice, that was.

1491
01:19:16,464 --> 01:19:18,424
MILKY: Yeah, well, you know.

1492
01:19:18,466 --> 01:19:20,093
I do what I do.

1493
01:19:21,094 --> 01:19:22,470
You do!

1494
01:19:22,512 --> 01:19:24,013
MILKY: Oh, fuck.

1495
01:19:24,931 --> 01:19:26,933
- What's he doing?
- I dort know.

1496
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:29,269
- All right, Milks?
- What are you saying, mate?

1497
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:30,812
How are you doing?

1498
01:19:30,854 --> 01:19:31,855
Sound.

1499
01:19:31,896 --> 01:19:33,606
What have you two been up to?

1500
01:19:33,648 --> 01:19:35,900
You know how it is, having a bit of fun.

1501
01:19:40,446 --> 01:19:42,240
What's up, mate?

1502
01:19:43,241 --> 01:19:44,617
You look down.

1503
01:19:44,659 --> 01:19:46,661
One of them days.
You know what I mean?

1504
01:19:47,662 --> 01:19:49,080
Look, man, erm...

1505
01:19:50,081 --> 01:19:51,708
Any chance you can get me any weed?

1506
01:19:52,667 --> 01:19:55,169
I just want a sm0ke.
You know what I mean?

1507
01:19:56,004 --> 01:19:58,673
I mean, I've only got, like,
one spliff left on me.

1508
01:19:58,715 --> 01:20:00,717
I can't really give that away.

1509
01:20:00,758 --> 01:20:03,469
- What were you after?
- About an ounce or summat.

1510
01:20:03,511 --> 01:20:04,971
Fucking hell.

1511
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:06,472
no, mate, no.

1512
01:20:06,514 --> 01:20:09,100
I couldrt get anything like that big, no way.

1513
01:20:09,142 --> 01:20:12,478
I mean, I'll give you half, I'll split it.
Give you half of it.

1514
01:20:13,521 --> 01:20:15,523
Well, I mean, I might be able to...

1515
01:20:16,524 --> 01:20:18,318
...to get... get like that much.

1516
01:20:18,359 --> 01:20:19,777
What?

1517
01:20:21,154 --> 01:20:22,155
What?

1518
01:20:22,947 --> 01:20:24,949
I thought you were gonna
walk me home.

1519
01:20:24,991 --> 01:20:28,703
You can be there in, like, 15 minutes,
if you get a move on now.

1520
01:20:29,787 --> 01:20:31,789
You're only a mile down the road.

1521
01:20:31,831 --> 01:20:33,458
Are you j0king?

1522
01:20:33,499 --> 01:20:34,500
What?

1523
01:20:35,710 --> 01:20:38,379
Oh, fuck you, you selfish bastard.

1524
01:20:42,926 --> 01:20:44,552
Fuckir hell, man.

1525
01:20:45,887 --> 01:20:47,680
BOTH: women!

1526
01:20:49,557 --> 01:20:51,559
SMELL: Ooh-ooh-ooh!

1527
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:53,228
Watch it.

1528
01:20:53,269 --> 01:20:55,480
- Banj0 for a banj0.
- Yeah.

1529
01:20:58,274 --> 01:20:59,275
Ah.

1530
01:20:59,317 --> 01:21:00,944
Ooh-ooh-ooh!

1531
01:21:00,985 --> 01:21:02,987
- Come on, Smell.
SMELL: Oh, no.

1532
01:21:03,029 --> 01:21:06,533
- Come on.

1533
01:21:06,574 --> 01:21:08,159
Wait for it.

1535
01:21:11,538 --> 01:21:13,540
- Kick donkey!

1536
01:21:13,581 --> 01:21:14,999
Kick donkey.

SMELL: I'm not making tea.

01:21:26,302 --> 01:21:28,304
Anyone got a problem?

1539
01:21:28,346 --> 01:21:29,806
no problem.

1540
01:21:33,434 --> 01:21:35,436
no. Problem with what, man?

1541
01:21:36,855 --> 01:21:39,440
Good to see you, Milk.
Are you all right, mate?

1542
01:21:40,191 --> 01:21:41,943
All right, Tubbs.

1543
01:21:43,736 --> 01:21:45,321
Is woody on his way?

1544
01:21:45,363 --> 01:21:46,948

1545
01:21:49,075 --> 01:21:51,786
- All right, Milks?
- Are you all right, mate?

1546
01:22:09,804 --> 01:22:11,181
no problem.

1547
01:22:12,265 --> 01:22:13,975
Sit down, Milks.

1548
01:22:17,395 --> 01:22:18,855
That's good.

1549
01:22:19,856 --> 01:22:21,858
That means we can all get stoned.

1550
01:22:23,067 --> 01:22:24,569
(Laughter)

1551

# At the dark end...

1552
01:22:27,822 --> 01:22:29,407
A chocolate bassline.

1553
01:22:29,449 --> 01:22:31,451

1556
01:22:37,624 --> 01:22:39,626
Combo. My dancing buddy.

Ow!

01:23:10,073 --> 01:23:14,661
# I know time's gonna take its toII...

1567
01:23:15,662 --> 01:23:17,497

# We have to pay for the love...

1569
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:22,710
Take him home, love. He looks fucked.

1570
01:23:25,046 --> 01:23:27,465
# It's a sin and we know...

1571
01:23:27,507 --> 01:23:29,217
It's all right, Gadge, lad.

1572
01:23:30,218 --> 01:23:32,303
Have you fucking seen how white he is!

1573
01:23:32,345 --> 01:23:34,973
I've never seen anyone
look that fucking sick!

1574
01:23:35,974 --> 01:23:37,976
That fucking kid's arse went white!

#... steal away...

1576
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:43,273
Come on.

1577
01:23:43,314 --> 01:23:45,692
# to the dark end

1578
01:23:45,733 --> 01:23:47,861
# Of the street...

1579
01:23:47,902 --> 01:23:49,237
Oh, man.

1580
01:23:49,279 --> 01:23:50,780
Here you are.

1581
01:23:50,864 --> 01:23:52,782
no, seriously, Combo, man.

1582
01:23:53,908 --> 01:23:57,203
I've got to tell you, mate,
you're a good geezer, man.

1583
01:23:57,245 --> 01:23:59,664
Seriously. I mean, this... this music,

1584
01:23:59,706 --> 01:24:04,919
this sort of music is the sort of stuff
that I listen to, my uncles listen to.

1585
01:24:04,961 --> 01:24:07,797
Yeah, to me, this is good music.

1586
01:24:07,881 --> 01:24:12,552
What you've gotta remember, Milks,
right, is... is I'm an original skinead.

1587
01:24:12,594 --> 01:24:14,095
'69, me.

1588
01:24:14,137 --> 01:24:19,100
But it was people like your uncle,
your uncle that introduced that stuff to me.

1589
01:24:19,142 --> 01:24:22,353
The soul of that music
just fucking resonated within us,

1590
01:24:22,395 --> 01:24:24,063
do you know what I mean?

1591
01:24:24,105 --> 01:24:28,067
And it's people... it's skineads, like you,
true skineads, like you,

1592
01:24:28,109 --> 01:24:29,903
keeping that flame alive.

1593
01:24:29,944 --> 01:24:32,155
Yeah. It was fucking unity.

1594
01:24:32,197 --> 01:24:34,866
It was black and white, together.
Know what I mean?

1595
01:24:34,908 --> 01:24:37,410
It should not be forgotten.
It shouldrt die.

1596
01:24:37,452 --> 01:24:41,122
You're still flying that flag in that fucking
get-out that you're wearing.

1597
01:24:41,164 --> 01:24:42,582
It's proper.

1598
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,083
It's real, man.

1599
01:24:44,125 --> 01:24:45,460
Oh, man.

1600
01:24:46,461 --> 01:24:49,130
That's it, man,
we're like brothers now. Yeah?

1601
01:24:49,172 --> 01:24:50,256
Serious.

1602
01:24:51,174 --> 01:24:53,176
- For life.
- Yeah, for life.

1603
01:24:53,218 --> 01:24:54,761
Nice one, Combo.

1604
01:24:54,802 --> 01:24:56,346
Hand the spliff over.

1605
01:24:56,387 --> 01:24:59,182
I haven't had a laugh like this
for fucking years.

1606
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:00,600
- Serious.
- For years.

1607
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:02,852
Here you are. It's been a long time.

1608
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:07,232
I want some chocolate.

1609
01:25:11,861 --> 01:25:15,281
- There's biscuits in the cupboard.
- not in that cupboard.

1610
01:25:17,283 --> 01:25:19,494
no, not in that cupboard. I'm starving!

1611
01:25:19,536 --> 01:25:23,039
How can you fucking live like this?
There's not even a mouldy Twiglet.

1612
01:25:24,165 --> 01:25:27,627
I'm really starving, man.
I've got the munchies badly.

1613
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:30,463
- Combo, have you eaten the biscuits?
- no.

1614
01:25:30,505 --> 01:25:33,299
- Fucking hell.
MILKY: What a night.

1615
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,762
so, how many uncles have you got?

1616
01:25:37,804 --> 01:25:39,055
Erm...

1617
01:25:40,223 --> 01:25:43,560
I've got three uncles and two aunties.

1618
01:25:43,601 --> 01:25:45,270
so, a big family, then.

1619
01:25:45,311 --> 01:25:46,354
Yeah.

1620
01:25:47,397 --> 01:25:51,234
I've got... What is it? 22 cousins.

1621
01:25:53,236 --> 01:25:55,822
One uncle's got, what, seven kids.

1622
01:25:55,864 --> 01:25:57,866
What, to the same woman, like?

1623
01:25:57,907 --> 01:25:59,200
Nah.

1624
01:25:59,242 --> 01:26:01,744
Spread out
between three different women.

1625
01:26:01,786 --> 01:26:06,040
One's got two, the other's got two,
and another one's got three kids.

1626
01:26:06,082 --> 01:26:09,168
And he just, like,
left these families and fucked off?

1627
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:11,754
Nah, he still sees 'em.

1628
01:26:11,796 --> 01:26:14,257
Yeah, to me,
he still spends time with them.

1629
01:26:14,299 --> 01:26:19,095
They're always round at Christmas
and stuff like that. We all get together.

1630
01:26:19,137 --> 01:26:21,431
A big party till late in the morning.

1631
01:26:23,266 --> 01:26:25,268
Yeah, it's... it's nice.

1632
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:28,104
It is. It's nice having a big family.

1633
01:26:28,146 --> 01:26:29,856
Have you got a mum and dad?

1634
01:26:29,898 --> 01:26:32,275
Cos you haven't talked about
your mum or dad.

1635
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:35,236
Yeah, I've got a mum and dad.

1636
01:26:35,278 --> 01:26:36,738
Of course, man.

1637
01:26:36,821 --> 01:26:39,616
A good mum and dad.
Yeah, I can't knock 'em at all.

1638
01:26:40,325 --> 01:26:45,079
I was one of them kids where...
my dad was away all the time.

1639
01:26:45,121 --> 01:26:48,249
sometimes he was away for, like,
a fortnight, working.

1640
01:26:48,291 --> 01:26:49,375
But...

1641
01:26:50,376 --> 01:26:54,547
I never blamed my dad or anything
like that for him being away and working.

1642
01:26:54,589 --> 01:26:55,590
Cos...

1643
01:26:55,632 --> 01:26:58,092
there was always food on that table.

1644
01:26:58,134 --> 01:27:00,553
That's what I respect that man for.

1645
01:27:00,595 --> 01:27:01,971
Always.

1646
01:27:03,973 --> 01:27:05,975
Lucky you, aren't you?

1647
01:27:06,059 --> 01:27:07,560
I tell you...

1648
01:27:07,602 --> 01:27:09,604
you know, any, any time...

1649
01:27:10,605 --> 01:27:12,815
...you wanna come round
for something to eat,

1650
01:27:12,857 --> 01:27:15,860
you have to come to my grandma's
to get something to eat.

1651
01:27:15,902 --> 01:27:17,612
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man.

1652
01:27:17,654 --> 01:27:20,865
She'll cook some rice.
She'll cook some peas.

1653
01:27:20,907 --> 01:27:23,159
She'll cook some chicken.

1654
01:27:23,201 --> 01:27:25,245
She sounds dead lovely, dort she?

1655
01:27:25,286 --> 01:27:28,706
Serious, man, then you come home
for some ackee and swordfish.

1656
01:27:29,707 --> 01:27:31,501
That'd be nice, wouldrt it?

1657
01:27:31,543 --> 01:27:33,336
Ah, seriously, man, cos...

1658
01:27:33,378 --> 01:27:38,258
I'd love for you to do that.
I'd love for you to do that. That'd be nice.

1659
01:27:38,299 --> 01:27:42,762
Serious, come and see how we...
how we live. Know what I mean?

1660
01:27:42,804 --> 01:27:45,473
Even on a bad day,
there'll probably be...

1661
01:27:45,515 --> 01:27:47,851
a couple of my uncles
and about seven...

1662
01:27:47,892 --> 01:27:50,478
Fucking hell.
You've got everything, haven't you?

1663
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,355
- What?
- You've got the whole lot.

1664
01:27:53,398 --> 01:27:55,650
You've got the whole fucking
perfect package.

1665
01:27:56,985 --> 01:27:58,361
Fucking hell.

1666
01:28:00,196 --> 01:28:01,948
Got everything, you, didn't you?

1667
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:06,369
Fucking hell, man. so...

1668
01:28:07,704 --> 01:28:10,665
What... What do you think
makes a bad dad?

1669
01:28:13,251 --> 01:28:16,004
I dort know, mate. I'm not a dad, am I?

1670
01:28:17,797 --> 01:28:19,799
I know you had a good dad, like, but,

1671
01:28:19,841 --> 01:28:24,220
be honest with me, what do you really think
makes a bad dad, though?

1672
01:28:24,262 --> 01:28:26,139
I dort know, man.

1673
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:28,183
What's with the questions, man?

1674
01:28:28,224 --> 01:28:30,560
I feel like I'm being interr0gated.

1675
01:28:33,855 --> 01:28:35,982
What do you reckon?

1676
01:28:36,983 --> 01:28:37,984
Niggers.

1677
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:43,823
- What's with the "nigger"?
- Because you are, aren't you?

1678
01:28:43,865 --> 01:28:46,367
You're a fucking nigger. Arert you?

1679
01:28:49,579 --> 01:28:50,872
Arert you?

Hey, what am I gonna do?

It's not my fault. I didn't mean it.
