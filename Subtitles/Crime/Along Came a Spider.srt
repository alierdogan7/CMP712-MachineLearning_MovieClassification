00:27:15,325 --> 00:27:18,453
That's about as much

between Amy Masterson and Soneji?

342
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:35,171

Why do you ask?

343

He strangled her.

344
00:27:38,681 --> 00:27:41,548
It's an act of passion.

345
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:44,553
It's a demonstration
of will.

346
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,112

- Alex.

00:27:54,364 --> 00:27:57,663
Alex. Womars intuition.
Third eye. Sixth sense...

350
00:27:57,734 --> 00:27:59,668
whatever it is.
I don't have it.

351
00:27:59,736 --> 00:28:01,795
Sure you do. You just
don't look at it right.

352
00:28:01,871 --> 00:28:03,862
Every face has two aspects.

353
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,569
Now try looking at it down
the middle. One side at a time.

354

Would you say this man
was confident?

355
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:12,912
- Yeah.
- Narcissistic?

356
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:17,316
- L-I wouldn't know.
- Ever see any flashes of hatred?

357
00:28:17,387 --> 00:28:20,754
- No. No. No!
- Anger? Hostility?

358
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:25,261
Look. Everything about him
was right.

359
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:29,492
He was always patient. He was
pleasant. He had a sense of humor.

360
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:32,899

the perfect teacher.

your primary material witness?

367

to start an argument.

368
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,900
I need to help get her back.

369

370
00:29:09,806 --> 00:29:12,104

- That's right.

371
00:29:12,175 --> 00:29:15,303
- No. You can't.
- Can I tell you why I don't care?

372
00:29:18,248 --> 00:29:20,182
Shoot.

373
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,684
Look. When I was
assigned to Cathedral.

374
00:29:28,758 --> 00:29:30,749
It was a job
I didn't want.

375
00:29:30,827 --> 00:29:34,456
It's a far cry from working
rope lines or flying Air Force One.

376

But I have been there
for three years.

377
00:29:38,134 --> 00:29:41,934
I have been responsible
for Megan for three years.

378
00:29:42,005 --> 00:29:45,168
And that little girl means
more to me than even a partner.

379
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,903
Can you understand that?

380
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,680
I suppose so.

381
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:59,080
Even if I say no. You'll probably
follow me around wherever I go.

382
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:05,258
So. If it's a choice between
having you as a partner...

383
00:30:05,328 --> 00:30:10,994
or as a stalker. I guess I'll
take my chances with a partner.

- Mm-hmm.

on the Internet is connected.

Oh. When you find Soneji.
Ask him for the password.

on the girl's hard drive.

Yeah.

852
01:14:58,156 --> 01:15:01,421
I wondered what happened to it
during the ransom drop.

853
01:15:04,829 --> 01:15:06,763
The ransom drop.

854
01:15:06,831 --> 01:15:09,561
That was
a well-earned 12 million.

855
01:15:10,768 --> 01:15:13,396
Twelve million.

856
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,102
Senator Rose says
he can pull strings.

857
01:15:18,176 --> 01:15:22,112
He says he can fix it so you
keep the 12 million and walk.

the child. Where is Megan?

She's trapped on my boat. Alex.
Isn't that right?

862
01:15:40,571 --> 01:15:45,201
Or maybe she's stuck in a warehouse
somewhere or floating in a river.

What would life had been like
with parents like that?

01:16:02,193 --> 01:16:05,754
Come on, Gary, blaming your parents
for what you are?

01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:08,458
I'm not blaming them, Alex.

They've been punished
already.

Not really.
It was a new experience.

No. Being

876
01:16:45,236 --> 01:16:48,967
So, in your opinion, Doctor,

877
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:53,703
were my actions
triggered by nature...

878
01:16:53,778 --> 01:16:55,837
or nurture?

879
01:16:56,947 --> 01:16:59,415

to be brutally honest...

task force hunting him.

- Hmm. But. None of that excuses...

03:07:19,457 --> 03:07:21,721
Where's Megan?

2018
03:07:21,793 --> 03:07:24,660
She's in the barn.
She was so doped up.

2019
03:07:24,729 --> 03:07:26,924
I don't think she knew
I took her off the boat.

2020
03:07:26,998 --> 03:07:30,058
She's still alive? You were
supposed to dump her in the river...

2021
03:07:30,135 --> 03:07:34,265
- after you got the diamonds.
- Yeah. Well.

2022
03:07:34,339 --> 03:07:38,332
Maybe killing a kid is something
I'm not prepared to do on my own.

2023
03:07:38,410 --> 03:07:41,208
Anyway. Today. Tomorrow. It's still
gonna look like Soneji killed her.

2024
03:07:41,279 --> 03:07:44,214
She can't die
after Soneji. You idiot.

2025
03:07:44,282 --> 03:07:47,740
It doesn't make any difference.
They're never gonna find the body.

2026
03:07:52,490 --> 03:07:56,517
Okay. I'll go do it now.
Will that make you happy?

2027
03:07:56,595 --> 03:08:00,725
Yeah. It would. Wait!

2028
03:08:04,369 --> 03:08:06,462
Can I see them?

2029
03:08:21,786 --> 03:08:24,016
Hey. Do you realize
we spent an entire year...

2030
03:08:24,089 --> 03:08:27,581
following Soneji's
every move?

2031
03:08:27,659 --> 03:08:30,059
I think
we deserve these.

2032
03:08:34,566 --> 03:08:38,263
That beats the hell out of
a Secret Service pension. Huh?

2033
03:08:39,504 --> 03:08:42,598
Profiling the profiler.

2034
03:08:42,674 --> 03:08:45,074
Kidnap from the kidnapper.
That's brilliant.

2035
03:08:45,143 --> 03:08:48,442
You are a genius. Jez.

2036
03:08:48,513 --> 03:08:51,710
Genius has nothing to do with it.
I'm just good at what I do.

2037
03:08:55,053 --> 03:08:58,181
Didrt hurt that everyone else
involved was a complete half-wit.

2038
03:08:58,256 --> 03:09:00,656
You think Alex Cross
is a half-wit?

2039
03:09:00,725 --> 03:09:04,422
You really believe that
he shot Soneji to save my life?

2040
03:09:04,496 --> 03:09:08,865
Cross pulled the trigger because
he knew Soneji didn't have Megan.

2041
03:09:10,735 --> 03:09:12,669
What are you saying?

2042
03:09:12,737 --> 03:09:16,138
I'm saying that sooner or later.
He's gonna figure it out.

2043
03:09:16,207 --> 03:09:18,675
He already knows Soneji
didn't run the ransom.

2044
03:09:20,445 --> 03:09:22,436
He's onto us already.
Isn't he?

2045
03:09:22,514 --> 03:09:25,608
No. He's not onto us.

2046
03:09:27,085 --> 03:09:30,316
But I think
he's onto you.

2047
03:10:03,054 --> 03:10:04,487
[Beeps]

2048
03:10:08,893 --> 03:10:11,088
[Computer Beeps]

2049
03:11:14,492 --> 03:11:17,950
It's Turkish. My daddy won it
in a game of poker.

2050
03:11:18,029 --> 03:11:21,021
That's about as much
as I know about my father.

2051
03:11:30,308 --> 03:11:32,003
[Beeps]

2052
03:12:23,294 --> 03:12:25,228
[Straining]

2053
03:13:04,002 --> 03:13:06,368
Megan?

2054
03:13:06,437 --> 03:13:08,496
Megan. It's me. Honey.

2055
03:13:08,573 --> 03:13:10,578
Jezzie?

2056
03:13:10,578 --> 03:13:11,510
Jezzie?

2057
03:13:11,579 --> 03:13:14,639
Jezzie. Jezzie.
I'm in here! Jezzie!

2058
03:13:14,715 --> 03:13:17,445
Open up. Honey. I'm gonna
take you home. It's all over.

2059
03:13:17,518 --> 03:13:20,248
Yeah. Sure.
Just hold on a second.

2060
03:13:20,321 --> 03:13:22,255
[Straining]

2061
03:13:26,994 --> 03:13:30,327
- Jezzie?
- Yeah. Honey.

2062
03:13:30,398 --> 03:13:33,094
What happened
to that other guy?

2063
03:13:35,636 --> 03:13:39,197
He's dead. Megan.
You're safe now.

2064
03:13:39,273 --> 03:13:42,106
Open up.

2065
03:13:42,176 --> 03:13:45,577
- Jezzie?
- Yeah, honey.

2066
03:13:45,646 --> 03:13:48,206
Why isn't there
anyone else with you?

2067
03:13:52,453 --> 03:13:56,617
Megan. It's me. Don't be
scared of me. Open the door.

2068
03:14:01,829 --> 03:14:04,957
Megan, I'm gonna ask you
one more time to open the door.

2069
03:14:05,032 --> 03:14:07,557
- Right now. Open the door!
- [Kicks Door]

2070
03:14:07,635 --> 03:14:10,160
Megan, open the door
for me.

2071
03:14:10,237 --> 03:14:12,705
Listen to me!
Open the door!

2072
03:14:12,773 --> 03:14:15,674
- [Kicking Door]
- Megan. Open the fucking door!

2073
03:14:15,743 --> 03:14:19,008
Open it, bitch!

2074
03:14:20,481 --> 03:14:22,711
- [Gunshot]
- [Screams]

2075
03:14:24,785 --> 03:14:27,913
Stop it! No!
[Screams]

2076
03:14:27,989 --> 03:14:29,923
Stop it!

2077
03:14:34,228 --> 03:14:36,162
[Breathing Heavily]

2078
03:14:45,773 --> 03:14:47,934
[Whimpering]

2079
03:15:39,794 --> 03:15:41,728
That was very clever.
Megan.

2080
03:15:49,837 --> 03:15:52,567
[Straining,
Whimpering]

2081
03:16:24,071 --> 03:16:27,131
- [Muffled Screams]
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

2082
03:17:10,584 --> 03:17:12,916
Jezzie?

2083
03:17:16,390 --> 03:17:18,858
It's over.

2084
03:17:18,926 --> 03:17:20,860
Drop the gun.

2085
03:17:24,765 --> 03:17:26,699
Alex...

2086
03:17:28,903 --> 03:17:30,837
how-how did you. Um...

2087
03:17:30,905 --> 03:17:33,237
Aces and eights. Jezzie.

2088
03:17:33,307 --> 03:17:36,868
Plus, your timing
was a little off.

2089
03:17:36,944 --> 03:17:38,878
I watched the tapes.

2090
03:17:38,946 --> 03:17:43,747
You and Devine could have
stopped Soneji at the school.

2091
03:17:43,817 --> 03:17:46,752
Just like you could have stopped
him at the Russian Embassy.

2092
03:17:46,820 --> 03:17:49,254
But you had
a different agenda.

2093
03:17:49,323 --> 03:17:52,451
You know something. Alex?

2094
03:17:52,526 --> 03:17:54,619
When you said.
"You do what you are."

2095
03:17:54,695 --> 03:17:57,220
You were right.

2096
03:17:57,298 --> 03:18:00,426
I'm living proof.

2097
03:18:01,702 --> 03:18:04,193
Put the gun down. Jezzie.

2098
03:18:09,977 --> 03:18:13,276
Would you kill
another partner?

2099
03:18:13,347 --> 03:18:16,077
You're not my partner.

2100
03:18:23,390 --> 03:18:25,722
[Whimpering]

2101
03:19:31,191 --> 03:19:33,352
Are you all right?

2102
03:19:35,929 --> 03:19:38,124
You're a very brave girl.
Megan.

2103
03:19:38,198 --> 03:19:41,292
Who are you?

2104
03:19:41,368 --> 03:19:44,303
I'm a policeman.

2105
03:19:47,474 --> 03:19:50,409
My name is Alex Cross.

2106
03:19:50,477 --> 03:19:53,037
I'm a friend
of your parents.

2107
03:19:56,650 --> 03:19:58,880
Can you take me to them?

2108
03:20:00,353 --> 03:20:03,083
Nothing would give me
greater pleasure.

2109
03:20:06,793 --> 03:20:10,593
Could you...
Ah. Thanks.
