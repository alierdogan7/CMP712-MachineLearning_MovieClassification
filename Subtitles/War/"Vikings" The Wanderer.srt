1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,534
Lothbrok:
Previously on Vikings...

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:05,504
Ecbert: <i>I am determined</i>
<i>to honor our treaty.</i>

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,573
In return, some of you,

4
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:09,641
Must fight for
Princess Kwenthrith.

5
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:12,511
Lothbrok: That is not part
of our original agreement,

6
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,746
But, I will fight.

7
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,016
Kwenthrith:
My uncle's name is Brihtwulf.

8
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:18,183
He has usurped my crown.

9
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,284
And your younger brother?

10
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:20,619
His name is Burgred.

11
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,421
My uncle has
poisoned his mind.

12
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:24,556
Why are they
just attacking my uncle?

13
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,125
(all shouting battle cries)

14
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,626
(yelling)

15
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,028
(grunts)

16
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:36,635
Athelstan:
King Ecbert says that
all this land is yours.

17
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:39,304
There are many farms
on this land for you
to take possession of.

18
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:42,307
Ragnar and Lagertha
talk only of farming.

19
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,811
Persuade your family to
support me as Earl.

20
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:48,080
(if I had a heart playing)

21
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,570
(soldiers shouting
in distance)

22
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,799
(men laughing)

23
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,488
You're not eating.

24
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,223
I know.

25
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,225
I'm not hungry.

26
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,328
For the first time in
your life.

27
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,433
There's a first time
for everything.

28
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,770
Here. These will help.

29
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,506
Thank you.

30
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:02,681
May Freya lie with you
tonight, and take
care of you, my friend.

31
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,533
I am so happy that
my uncle is dead.

32
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,403
But I still don't believe it.

33
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,838
You saw him killed.

34
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,508
Yes.

35
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,777
Yes I did.

36
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:33,512
But now...

37
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:36,782
Now I want his head!

38
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,318
I want his head,
I need his head.

39
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,287
And then I will believe it.

40
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,690
Floki.

41
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,427
(in native tongue)

42
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,343
Why do you hate your
uncle so much?

43
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,648
Do you think that
my older brother was
the only member

44
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,317
Of my family who raped
me when I was a child?

45
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,821
It was my uncle who first
brought him to me.

46
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,790
Since I was six years old,
he abused me.

47
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:21,460
He violated my body
and my soul.

48
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,529
And he told me not to
resist the attentions
of the many men

49
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,999
That he brought to me,
saying that they all
wanted the pleasure...

50
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:28,267
(gasping)

51
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:32,638
They all wanted the pleasure
of sleeping with a child.

52
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,342
And the last was
my brother, who shared
me with my uncle.

53
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:41,413
And even when
I cried and I said
that they were hurting me,

54
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,015
They didn't stop.

55
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,852
They never stopped.

56
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,557
(chopping and grunting)

57
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,714
(in native tongue)

58
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,585
Give this to me.

59
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,892
(breathing deeply)

60
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,436
(gasping and stabbing)

61
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,073
(giggling)

62
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,782
(spitting)

63
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,655
(laughing)

64
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,424
(all laughing)

65
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:10,035
It was good today.
I enjoyed fighting.

66
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,372
You fought well today,
I watched.

67
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,108
But you took too many risks.

68
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,945
You jumped
into battle, you did
not stay by my side.

69
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,415
Don't do that, Porunn.
You have much to learn.

70
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,818
Do you suddenly
not believe in our gods?

71
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,554
Do you not believe in fate?

72
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,458
Is that really Bjorn,
Son of Ragnar,

73
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,695
Or some impostor
who just looks like him?

74
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,931
I only do this because
I care about you.

75
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,700
Or because I'm a woman.

76
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,870
- (scoffs) No.
- Yes.

77
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:49,608
Marry me.

78
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:51,777
What?

79
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,013
I asked you to marry me.
What is your answer?

80
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,719
Yes.

81
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,522
I will marry you, Bjorn.

82
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:04,956
I will marry you.

83
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,664
Good.

84
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,139
(birds chirping)

85
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,619
(heartbeat thudding)

86
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,246
(screaming)

87
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:44,856
(screaming)

88
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,898
(indistinct shouting)

89
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,714
Why did you do that?

90
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,119
It's just the angle
of the leg.

91
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,088
Couldn't help myself.

92
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,890
(chuckling)

93
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,293
Kwenthrith: There you are!

94
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,763
I'm looking for your king.

95
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,268
(laughing)

96
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,905
Of course,
you don't understand
a word I'm saying.

97
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,041
(giggling drunkenly)

98
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,615
Oh, thank you.

99
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,829
(humming)

100
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,235
(Kwenthrith laughing)

101
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,375
(men laughing)

102
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:11,743
No!

103
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,649
At least you
understood that!
Didn't you?

104
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,657
(both chuckling)

105
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,696
No.

106
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,201
Lothbrok: Rollo!

107
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:05,096
Athelstan, ask the king
who used to farm this land
he has given us.

108
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,400
(in native tongue)

109
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,275
He confesses that he
has had to remove

110
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,310
Several saxon farmers
from their lands.

111
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,284
Then ask him if they will
not be hostile to us?
And if so,

112
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,855
Who will guarantee
the safety of our own
farms and communities?

113
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,858
(in native tongue)

114
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,181
He will personally
guarantee our
safety and security.

115
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,052
I thank the king
from the bottom
of my heart.

116
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:07,025
It was always
Ragnar's dream to find
land to farm

117
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:10,462
For our young folk,
and to live peacefully
with others.

118
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,232
Now, it is my dream, also.

119
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,034
(translating in native tongue)

120
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,373
(in native tongue)

121
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,250
What does he say?

122
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,487
He asks if you
are a free woman?

123
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,539
(indistinct shouting)

124
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:09,354
They are coming!
Let us prepare!

125
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:13,024
- Look at what they've done!
- Look at the lead boat.

126
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,819
(speaking latin)

127
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:53,464
My lord, your army
has abandoned you and
gone. Save yourself!

128
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,437
Burgred! Beloved brother!
Stay yourself.

129
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,576
Wait and I will see
that you come to no harm!

130
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,412
Burgred, please,
you must trust me!

131
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,981
Abandon your
false advisors.

132
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,918
You must not trust her.
She killed your brother
and she will kill you.

133
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:18,590
-But I do love her.
-Survive first,
love afterwards.

134
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:21,025
Come. Come now,
or it's too late.

135
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,332
My lord.

136
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:30,969
Burgred, wait!

137
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,277
(grunting)

138
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,524
Athelstan:
King ecbert has arranged

139
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:02,627
For some of the laborers
who worked here
to help us farm the land.

140
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,362
Whoa.

141
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:06,364
(horses whinnying)

142
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,345
- (in native tongue)
- (chuckling)

143
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,115
What are they saying?

144
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:28,386
They're saying
their grandfathers used
some of these tools.

145
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,442
(in native tongue)

146
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,185
(children laughing)

147
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,087
Helga:
May I tell you something?

148
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,490
I have had a dream.

149
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,559
I dreamed of a stranger,

150
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:46,264
Who was a man,
but he had no face.
Or none that I could well see.

151
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,069
There was snow on the ground
and he was walking towards
me through the snow,

152
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,104
So his footsteps
made no sound.

153
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,473
His arms were outstretched,
and in one hand,

154
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,408
He carried a ball
of flaming snow.

155
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,145
-In his other hand...
-His other hand was
covered in bright blood.

156
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:05,349
-And the blood left a trail
in the snow behind him.
-Yes.

157
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,518
And the drops were smoking
in the frozen ground?

158
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:09,720
- You too?
- Yes.

159
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:13,458
-Both of you?
-We have all dreamed
the same dream.

160
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,327
- Were you frightened?
- No.

161
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,230
I felt excited.

162
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,700
I felt a sense of expectation.

163
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,838
And when I woke up,
I was so disappointed
it was only a dream.

164
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,340
You are a Volva.

165
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,443
You say you can see things.
What does it mean?

166
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,513
I have no idea.

167
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,782
I do not know.

168
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,521
(thunder rumbling)

169
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,765
I see a harvest
celebrated in blood.

170
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,870
I see a trickster whose
weapon cleaves you.

171
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:04,675
I see that a marriage
of plow and sword
will sustain you,

172
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:07,745
Until you become
a virgin once more.

173
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,257
(in native tongue)

174
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,634
Athelstan, you should
bless this house.

175
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:32,703
Ask god to bless
its new occupants.

176
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,506
Let us pray.

177
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:40,845
In the name of
the father, the son,
and the holy spirit, amen.

178
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:45,650
I am thy lord, thy god,
which have brought you
out of the land of Egypt.

179
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:49,720
Out of the house of bondage,
thou shalt...

180
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:15,580
Kalf: Earl ingstad
has left you
to farm in England.

181
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,382
What good is that to us?

182
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,251
(crowd murmuring)

183
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:24,922
Peacefully, legally,
we have removed the
earl that was never here,

184
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,492
The Earl that came
to power by murder...

185
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:34,632
And the Earl who has
nothing between his legs,
but a goat's beard.

186
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:36,767
(all laughing)

187
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:40,605
I will lead you as Earl,
if you will have me.

188
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,308
All hail Earl Kalf!

189
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:53,985
Crowd: All hail Earl Kalf!
All hail Earl Kalf!

190
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:57,888
Hup, hup!

191
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,627
(in native tongue)

192
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,044
She will come.

193
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,497
Where would he have gone?

194
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,800
Ragnar, my brother
is a prisoner
of his advisors.

195
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,568
Then where would
they take him?

196
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:47,738
-To the town, to get
reinforcements.
-That is not good.

197
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,310
Go and find the town.

198
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:58,849
Lead on.

199
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,623
Why did you not go with them?

200
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,700
Judith: <i>Have we</i>
<i>any news of our army?</i>

201
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:17,802
Not yet.

202
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:22,073
But with Ragnar Lothbrok,
how can we fail?

203
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,343
Ever since I saw
Ragnar Lothbrok
and his kin

204
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:29,080
At my father's house,
I've been fascinated
by these northmen,

205
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:31,482
Especially by
their pagan ways.

206
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:34,418
You were a monk
at Lindisfarne, Athelstan.

207
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,687
But you lived amongst
the pagans.

208
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,956
Tell me, what was it like?

209
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,895
Lady Judith, you are a good
christian woman.

210
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:48,099
How could I describe
such things to you?

211
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,702
Try me.

212
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:04,648
Imagine that the sun
shone at night, and the
moon during the day.

213
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,686
And then imagine
that everything you
knew about Jesus Christ

214
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:09,854
Was not true,

215
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,857
And that the true god
was a living man,

216
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:17,661
With a single eye, a cloak,
a wide-brimmed hat,

217
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,867
And that this man, odin,
the all-father, knew the
secret of every heart,

218
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,102
And the destiny of all men.

219
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:30,775
And that he, too, was hanged
from a tree, and died
and was reborn.

220
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:37,014
Only, it happened
a long time before christ.
Before our lord.

221
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,885
And do you believe
in this odin?

222
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:47,658
I've had to ask myself,
"what is belief?" my lady.

223
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,429
(in native tongue)

224
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:34,905
Stones are much easier
to wear than earth.

225
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,908
(athelstan translating)

226
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,684
May I?

227
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,679
Beautiful.

228
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,279
Ancient one?

229
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,056
Where are you?

230
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,767
(labored breathing)

231
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,036
(screaming)

232
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,781
-(whispering)
He was bound...
-Helga: And bleeding.

233
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,849
So much blood upon him.

234
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:27,952
So much blood everywhere.

235
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,188
It was only a dream.

236
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,892
Yes. Only a dream.

237
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,846
Halt!

238
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,963
You know of Lord Burgred.

239
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:15,232
Of course you do.

240
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,069
But where is he?

241
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,105
I don't know.

242
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,806
Where were you riding to?

243
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,980
I had business in repton.

244
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:35,085
It must be very important
business. You were
riding like the wind.

245
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:58,075
I don't know where
Lord Burgred is.
Believe me.

246
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,744
(clears throat)

247
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,751
(sighing)

248
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,322
I don't believe you. Sorry.

249
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,795
(whimpering)

250
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:21,098
I could remove an eye,
or some teeth.
Do you have a preference?

251
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,133
(whimpers)

252
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,075
Why don't you just
say something?

253
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,210
Mention a place...

254
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:35,713
(shouting) A name!

255
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,947
(groaning)

256
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:42,853
Even if it's a lie,
it might just save your sight
for a little while.

257
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:45,189
(wailing)

258
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,194
There's an iron age fort
on top of the hill of the ash!

259
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,163
Burgred and his army
have gone there.

260
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:55,499
-They're waiting
for reinforcements.
-All right.

261
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,212
(sighing)
It's strange...

262
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,881
How you always know

263
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,351
When someone is
telling the truth.

264
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,125
I have no argument
with you, my friend.

265
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,461
Let's sup together.

266
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,367
We are not all like
The Northmen.

267
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,995
Forgive me, my lady, I...

268
00:29:57,997 --> 00:30:00,531
I did not want to disturb you.

269
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,900
I was just remembering...

270
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:07,237
I'm sure you can
never forget being
an artist. Nor a monk.

271
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:12,209
Which is why I've
come to ask you a favor.

272
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,512
I want you to
hear my confession.

273
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,949
I was never a priest,
I couldn't...

274
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:21,451
Bishop Edmund,
my confessor, is not here.

275
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:24,087
And I must confess
or live in purgatory.

276
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,293
(bells tolling in distance)

277
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,924
Forgive me, father,
for I have sinned.

278
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:05,429
In what ways have you
sinned, my child?

279
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,233
I have sinned in thought,
but not in deed.

280
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,270
Then your sins are not
so great as they might be.

281
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:15,625
(whispering)
They are still great.

282
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,577
What are these thoughts
you've had?

283
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,449
I have dreamed
of lying naked...

284
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,487
Beside a man who is
not my husband.

285
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:38,161
And did you just lie
beside him, or...

286
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:41,999
We made love.
And I enjoyed it
very much.

287
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,403
You've certainly sinned.

288
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:47,971
Yes.

289
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,507
Who...

290
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:54,544
Who was this man you lay with?

291
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:02,119
It was you, Athelstan.

292
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,403
(gasping)

293
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,343
Kalf: I had a dream
last night.

294
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:00,744
And in my dream...

295
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,049
Ragnar Lothbrok
tore the liver from my body...

296
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,452
And began to eat it.

297
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,624
I begged him to stop...

298
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:17,661
By saying that the liver

299
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,696
Is the seat of life.

300
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:24,001
But he just smiled
and went on eating,

301
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,604
With blood streaming
down his chin.

302
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,475
Einar: What did it mean?

303
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:34,144
Kalf: Who knows with dreams?

304
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:36,646
Einar: Are you afraid of
Ragnar Lothbrok?

305
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:43,153
What sensible man would
not be afraid of a farmer
who made himself a king?

306
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:46,189
Yes, but you, too,
had humble beginnings.

307
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,759
And not so humble dreams.

308
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:53,663
So, you want to be
like Ragnar?

309
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,770
I want to be famous
like Ragnar...

310
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:02,472
Yes.

311
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:06,510
I desire fame
above all things.

312
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:12,049
I want the poets to sing
of my exploits as
they sing of Ragnar's.

313
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:16,586
I want the gods to pay
an interest in me,

314
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,323
And prepare the bright halls
for my coming.

315
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:24,127
They say Ragnar is
descended from Odin.

316
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,531
He is still human.

317
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:30,667
If you cut him,
he will bleed.

318
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,074
(coins clinking)

319
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,152
- (clattering)
- (laughs)

320
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:53,790
(grunts)

321
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,498
- (coins clinking)
- (crowd reacting)

322
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:05,135
Hey! You bastards.

323
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,338
What, you couldn't have
done better, Torstein!

324
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,574
I don't care about that game.

325
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,343
I want you to cut off my arm.

326
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:20,484
-Why not keep it?
-Because it's killing me,
stupid.

327
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,320
It's no good to me anymore.

328
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:25,856
I don't want it.

329
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,825
In fact, I've always
hated this arm.

330
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,194
It has to go.

331
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:35,632
(exhales and sniffs)

332
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,200
I'll do it.

333
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,870
Ah, Bjorn.

334
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,639
Always so considerate.

335
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,875
A real credit to your father.

336
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:46,843
But...

337
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,479
I want Floki to do it.

338
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,785
Will you do it, floki?

339
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:58,889
I suppose so.

340
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,526
I would do the same for you.

341
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:03,727
I know.

342
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,164
That is why I shall do it.

343
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:10,834
Cut off his sleeve.

344
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,905
Come here.

345
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:20,710
(exclaiming)

346
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,276
You sure you want to go ahead?

347
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:57,480
No, not my head.
Just cut off the
stinking arm, man.

348
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,683
Get on with it.

349
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,632
Too bad it's not
your flicking arm.

350
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,502
You could have saved
some money.

351
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:21,304
(sizzling)

352
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:22,539
(hacking)

353
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:24,708
(screaming)

354
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,747
(sizzling and screaming)

355
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:33,450
Frey and Freya, ye gods,
be with him now.

356
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:35,452
(screaming and panting)

357
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,591
(indistinct chattering)

358
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,428
Earl Ingstad and I
would like to thank
both of you

359
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,330
For your hospitality
and kindness.

360
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:49,299
King Ecbert,
we remain in your debt

361
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:51,401
For this gift of land,
and hope.

362
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:55,872
No, I remain in
your debt, Athelstan,

363
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,943
For, on this journey,
you have suffered grievously.

364
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:06,049
And yet, it is you who has
taught me that it is possible
to respect two cultures,

365
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:08,351
And to live in amity
between them.

366
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:10,920
Thank you.

367
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:21,564
Please tell Earl Ingstad
how much I admire her
and that she is always,

368
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:23,733
Always welcome at my hearth.

369
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,702
(translating in native tongue)

370
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,342
(in native tongue)

371
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:41,851
It is so beautiful,
that it must have been
made by dwarves.

372
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:42,919
(chuckling)

373
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,588
We don't have dwarves
in England.

374
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:47,757
(in native tongue)

375
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:55,865
She says, "of course you do.
You just don't see them."

376
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:05,542
You did not wait to hear
your penance.

377
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:08,511
Here is my penance.
You are leaving.

378
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,949
Is that not a good thing?
It saves you from further sin.

379
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:41,578
So you love our
young monk, do you?

380
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,417
I do not love him.
He fascinates me.

381
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,922
Well, be careful, Judith,
who you choose
to be fascinated by.

382
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:55,992
It is true that
the more complicated
a person is,

383
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:58,628
The more interesting he is.

384
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,530
But at the same time,

385
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:03,600
The more dangerous he is.

386
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:08,004
And would you say that
about yourself, father-in-law?

387
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,505
Man in distance: I see them!

388
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:46,910
Man: My lord.

389
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,512
- I know where they are.
- Where are they?

390
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,582
On top of that hill.

391
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,954
-They're drawing us away
from our boats.
-Assemble the men.

392
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,525
- Aye, my lord.
- Yes, my lord. Straight on!

393
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,042
(inaudible)

394
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,540
(gasping)

395
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:27,744
I've injured my hand
rather badly, as you can see.

396
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,313
I wonder...

397
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:33,016
Can you help me?

398
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:41,925
(sizzling)

399
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,287
(door opening)
