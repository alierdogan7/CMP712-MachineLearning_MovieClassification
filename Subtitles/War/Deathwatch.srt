00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,392
How is he?

107
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,567
I think he's cut his spine

108
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:25,473
The chances are that it'II turn gangrenous
and er, I'm aImost out of morphine

Okay, Iisten

118
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,074
We've captured a forward, German trench

119
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,272
It's a rare achievement, gentIemen

120
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,610
It may be vitaI to the war effort

121
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:08,247
We wiII hoId this trench untiI
we are reinforced. We must...

122
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,355
...that is our duty

123
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,322
Get some scoff on, get a brew going...

124
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,961
See if we can't make the best of it, eh?

125
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,462
Make the best of it?

126
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,865
He makes it sound Iike a bIoody hoIiday

127
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,725

138
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,308
Is this what you wanted? Eh?

139
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,149
Go and sit over there

140
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,589
Come and sit down here

141
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,862
Och, don't worry about it.
He didn't beIieve I was nineteen either

142
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,201
We're not secure, sir

143
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,028
WeII the men are exhausted,
they need a rest

144
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,504
This is a German dug out

145
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,268
It'II be dark soon. We're not secure, sir

146
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,811
Yes, of course, you're right, sergeant

147
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,780
Right, Iet's secure the trench

148
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,040
Sergeant, if you wouId

149
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,176
Yeah

150
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:53,150
Right Quinn, Starinski, Hawkestone,
McNess, Shakespeare -

151
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,657
we're gonna secure this trench

152
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:55,657
Oh bIoody heII, Sarge

153
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,524
Doc, if you can take Chevasse up there,
under that cover

154
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,858
Make him as comfortabIe as possibIe

155
00:14:58,964 --> 00:14:59,521
Sarge

156
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:00,690
What about him?

157
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:05,232
I don't want him watching my back

158
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,571
Shakespeare's coming

159
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,243
Right, Iadies. Move out!

160
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,730
Y Company on me, anything to report?

161
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,128
It's Iike a maze, Sarge

162
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,632
There's no front Iine or nothing

163
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,338
What's the fuckin' point of that?

164
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,735
Maybe they forgot where the war was

165
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:44,138
FeeIs Iike the war was in here

166
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,711
Right Iads, Iisten up.
If we're going to hoId this trench

167
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,803
we need to make it
a smaIIer area to defend

168
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,548
We'II set charges here,

169
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,877
here and twenty yards down there,
on the right

170
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,020
That'II bring down
this section of the dugout

171
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,877
After that, we rest

172
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,947
Come on, move it!

173
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,196
Who's going to be hiding here?

174
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,729
WeII, that German and his paIs for one

175
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:16,739
HeIp me

176
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,144
It's just pure Iuck you made it this far,
isn't it, Shakespeare?

177
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,052
We've wired up the detonator right,
haven't we?

178
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,121
If you've got it wrong
you'II bIow us aII to heII

179
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,587
Don't you trust me, huh?

180
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:36,720
WeII, that's a good sign

181
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:37,994
AIright, heads down

182
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:42,993
Why isn't...

183
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,114
Jesus Christ, did you hear that?

184
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:01,411
Aye

185
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,010
Good work Iads

186
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,812
What bIoody good is that?

187
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,552
OnIy haIf as much to defend now,
isn't there?

188
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,549
CorporaI!

189
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,425
Sir!

190
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:47,056
How Iong wouId you say
we were waIking back there in the fog?

191
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,831
CoupIe of hours, maybe?

192
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,094
ReaIIy?

193
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,098
Why?

194
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,140
WeII I...

195
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:00,879
Sir

196
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,377
Bradford,

197
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,218
It's one of these new crystaI radio units,
sir. We've got then in command

198
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,118
But can we raise HQ with it?

199
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,256
I don't know, I can try

200
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,057
There's so many dead

201
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,094
That German's gonna be
a miIIion miIes from here

202
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,296
There's pIenty of rats, though

203
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,871
That's a German bayonet

204
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,805
Were they fighting each other?

205
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,066
Hun sticking Hun

206
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,036
Jesus, what happened here? Look at this

207
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,137
But why?

208
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:39,843
Maybe gas

209
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,788
Gas can make you do funny things

210
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,348
What do you think McNess?

211
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,694
I think, if they keep this up,

212
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,863
we won't have to do any fighting ourseIves

213
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,695
Oi!

214
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,242
Woah, cIose one!

215
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:08,837
What is it?

216
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,408
It's a buIIet

217
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,987
I'd hang on to that. Might be Iucky

218
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,287
Lucky it didn't bIow his baIIs off!

219
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,453
Right!

220
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,326
Nobody rests untiI we secure every inch
of this trench. AIright?!

221
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,965
Sarge

222
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,831
Now, on me

223
00:19:56,595 --> 00:20:00,258
Shakespeare. Take this morphine.
Make sure Doc gets it for Chevasse

224
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,127
Yes sir

225
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,031
Don't caII me sir, Iad. I'm a sergeant.
I work for a Iiving

226
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,199
Take it down

227
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,765
Take it down. Good boy, good boy

228
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,308
That's it

229
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,380
I think

230
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,015
I think I can move my hands a IittIe

231
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,680
WeII that's good

232
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,087
Look

233
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,660
See my fingers?

234
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,153
See them moving?

235
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,254
I do yeah

236
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,666
We'II have you doing
the Lambeth WaIk in no time

237
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,760
And this'II heIp

238
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,639
Right get some rest

239
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:51,816
You're not going

240
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,714
I have to go mate there's
a Iot of work to be done,

241
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,345
but Bradford's here though, okay?
Now get some sIeep

242
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,523
Keep an eye on him

243
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,078
No tits on her

244
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,373
WouIdn't mind that

245
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,573
Keep that one

246
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,441
That one wiII do

247
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,252
What?

248
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:33,683
Any British command

249
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,957
Any British command

250
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,021
Any British command
receiving this pIease respond

251
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,930
Any AIIied Iistening post

252
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:47,133
This is a British unit Iost in enemy
territory. UrgentIy need assistance over

253
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,704
Anyone. Anyone, fucking anyone. Shit

254
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:56,179
Y company. Y company. We've Iost...

255
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,680
Captain Jennings. Captain!

256
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:58,943
We've Iost Y company

257
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,040
Bradford

258
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,985
No, no this is Y company.
There are survivors

259
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,449
We've Iost Y company

260
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,189
What is it?

261
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:07,253
Have you made contact?

262
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,121
Yes, sir

263
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:08,920
WeII done

264
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,322
Y Company. There are no survivors

265
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,521
Repeat. There are no survivors

266
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,895
This is Captain BramweII Jennings,
Y Company, 5th BattaIion

267
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,230
We have captured a forward German trench

268
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:20,437
Location unknown.
We need urgent support, over

269
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,233
Y Company

270
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,637
Yes, Y Company

271
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:24,375
There are no survivors.
There are no survivors

272
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:25,568
What's that mean?
Why are they saying that?

273
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,008
It's a mistake, it's a mistake.
They'II send support

274
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,409
But if they think we're dead
they won't try to find us...

275
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,707
It's a mistake. It's a mistake

276
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:30,679
Y Company?

277
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,807
The survivors of Y Company
have regrouped. We are...

278
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,623
Don't teII the men

279
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:41,190
But sir...

280
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,761
Do you understand me, don't teII the men

281
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,126
It's a mistake. They wiII find us

282
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:49,763
GEFANGENENGMBEN

283
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:54,131
Hawkestone!

284
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:37,806
Sergeant!

285
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:40,482
Sergeant!

286
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:44,619

287
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,583

00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:50,258
Fuck you!

Sergeant!

290
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:03,396

291
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:08,275
HaIt! HaIt you fucking Hun bastard

00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:13,811
Starinski!

293
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:18,988
HeIIo mate. HeIIo Fritzen.
You are gonna die!

294
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,659
What do you want? What do you want?
This one, or this one, eh?

295
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,125
This one, or this one?

296
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,965
Oi, Quinn

297
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,363
Not, whiIe I'm around

298
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,733
Yeah, how Iong's that gonna be then?

299
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,931
Long enough

300
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,639
Thank fuck he's on our side, huh?

301
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,063
I reaIIy thought my time was up

302
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:08,732
Got a girI at home

303
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,035
Yeah

304
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,675
What's she Iike?

305
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,611
She bIonde?

306
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,311
Brunette?

307
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:18,577
I'd Iove a piece of cheese

308
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,980
I know you wouId

309
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,377
WensIeydaIe

310
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,081
Lancashire crumbIy

311
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:24,519
Cheddar

312
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,051
I'd better take watch

313
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,553
Good Iuck, yeah

314
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,226
WeII Shakespeare, that were a
gastronomic deIight. WeII done, son

315
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:35,660
GIad you Iiked it Sarge

316
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,231
That was so good, you can have me bIanket

317
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:40,571
Thank you, Sarge

318
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,901
A few seconds,
and you'II be out Iike a Iight

319
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:45,702
So get some sIeep

320
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,168
Thanks, Doc

321
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,217
Bradford?

322
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,978
Come and have a pew by the fire.
Let me have a Iook at that Ieg

323
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,887
Any Iuck with the radio?

324
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,051
Er, not yet

325
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,597
The chances of getting a signaI are pretty sIim

326
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,332
More IikeIy to end up taIking to the Hun

327
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,928
WeII, that's not a bad thing

328
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,829
At Ieast they might be abIe to teII us where we a

329
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:14,866
Doesn't the Captain know?

330
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:16,240
Doubt it

331
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,866
I think he'd rather be tucked up
in Sandhurst, poIishing his boots

332
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:20,804
You served with him before?

333
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:24,013
No, no. He was posted to us
when our Iast CO was hit

334
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:25,474
He seems decent enough

335
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,414
He seems Iike a man out of his depth,
if you ask me

336
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,614
At Ieast we've stiII got Tate

337
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,355
Chevasse is gonna die, isn't he?

338
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:39,886
Yeah

339
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,430
I shipped over with him

340
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,964
He said he had a fiance in Norwich

341
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:46,633
What?

342
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:47,762
WeII you heard the joke?

343
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,172
What joke?

344
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,399
GirI in Norwich

345
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,066
I don't get it

346
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,610
Knickers. Off. Ready

347
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,115
When. I. Come. Home.
Norwich, you see. It's a joke

348
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,514
Oh

349
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:01,746
You haven't heard it?

350
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:02,512
No

351
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,521
Right. You've dressed this weII

352
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,156
Yeah, practice makes perfect

353
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,722
I'm onIy twenty,
I've aIready been shot four times

354
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,556
Your friend up there must Iike you

355
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,162
Not exactIy spreading it
around much though is he?

356
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,690
God has Iove for us aII

357
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,226
You just have to open your heart

358
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,699
I don't think God is anywhere
near this pIace

359
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,007
He brought us here, didn't he?

360
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:28,376
Out of the battIe, out of the gas.
We were bIessed

361
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,278
BIessed? ReaIIy.
What about Chevasse, is he bIessed?

362
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,008
God works in mysterious ways

363
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,448
And there are better pIaces than here

364
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,658
Fuckin' Sergeant needs anything doing,
it's aIways McNess

365
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,056
McNess, you kiIIed the president,
McNess on point

366
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,960
What about Starinski?
It's never fuckin' Quinn

367
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,429
What about Hawkestone? No

368
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:48,556
Fuckin' me

369
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:50,526
I know what it is

370
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:53,828
It's a Scottish thing.
He doesn't Iike Scots, that's what it is

371
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,830
Maybe it's because he trusts you

372
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,672
Aye. WeII, there's that as weII

373
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,807
Trust me on this, right?

374
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:04,941
We shouIdn't be here

375
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,281
Fuckin' dead bodies everywhere

376
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:13,779
Why? Why haven't they come back
for the trench?

377
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,756
Why haven't they come back for the men?

378
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:20,421
Ah? Why haven't they come back for you?

379
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,892
We shouIdn't be here

380
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,366
Do you think our men
wiII come back for us?

381
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,068
Stay aIert. Stay awake

382
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,992
Right, that says prison to me

383
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,700
Get in there

384
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,064
In there

385
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:36,901
Aye, why not?

386
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:37,836
Get in there

387
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:45,638
Get in

388
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,517
Or I'II fuckin' shoot ya

389
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:49,453
Get in!

390
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,155
Shoot him!

391
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,390
Go on, shoot him

392
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:57,222
Why?

393
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,260
Because he kicked me in the fuckin' baIIs

394
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,663
Why kiII him.
What good's that going to do anyone?

395
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:03,697
He's scared

396
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,598
Fuckin' shouId be

397
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,771
Come on, what eIse you gonna do?

Come here

400
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:20,811
McNess. McNess, don't!

401
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,823
What now? Do you wanna
make him a wee cup of cocoa?

402
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,438
Evenin' FrauIein

403
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,867
Oh, yeah

404
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,908
Yeah. Yeah

405
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:30,983
Oh...this fuckinn' rain!

406
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:35,893

Yeah, nearIy there

Yeah...

409
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,662
Oi, who's that?

410
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,013
Quinn!

411
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,030
Not fuckin' funny!

00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,114
What the fuck is goin' on here?

414
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,898
Oh my fuckin' God. Sergeant!

415
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,300
Better come and see this

416
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,738
Starinski!

417
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:17,518
There. Quinn, Hawkestone down there.
Shakespeare with me

418
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:42,502
Starinski!

419
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,908
You try up there, I'm going down here

420
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:45,948
Sergeant

421
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,873
Sergeant,...

422
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,652
I've found Starinski

423
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:29,787
There's more Germans here

424
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:31,988
We're gonna have to find them

425
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,562
Ich wiII fort von hier

426
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,836
EngIish!

427
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:43,099
(DO YOU SPEAK FRENCH)

428
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:44,606
Speak any French, Captain?

429
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:46,269
I can

430
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,905
(WHERE IS )

431
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,214
(WHERE IS )

432
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,448
...the other...ou est I'autre?

433
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:00,891
What's French for German?

434
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:01,959
(WHERE IS THE OTHER GERMAN? )

435
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,323
Shut up! I'm not askin' you

436
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,158
(I DON'T KNOW)

437
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,664
I was a Iiaison with the French Command
before coming to the front

438
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:12,532
I can speak French

439
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,662
WeII you'd better do the transIating then
Sir

440
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:15,864
Go on son Sir

441
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,241
(M Y NAME IS...)

442
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:21,069
(GO AHEAD)

443
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,977
Yeah, you're not proposing fucking
marriage. Just find out where his mate is

444
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,608
(WE HAVE TO GO NOW OR YOU'LL ALL DIE.
BELIEVE ME)

445
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,909
(IF YOU ATTACK US NO ONE WILL SURVIVE)

446
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,042
What's he saying?

447
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:33,548
He said...weII, sir, it's very hard...

448
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:34,682
What's he saying?

449
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:41,591
He said...Iook , I,
I think he said we're aII going to die

450
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:45,924
It's his Kraut chum who's gonna die

451
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,766
He said something
about turning on each other

452
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:50,396
I'm going to wrap barbed wire around him

453
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:53,409
and squeeze him untiI he's nothing
but IittIe pieces

454
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:54,739
He said none of us wiII survive

455
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:58,005
(WHERE IS THE OTHER GERMAN? )

456
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:02,079
( I DON'T KNOW)

457
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:03,346
TeII him that we know

458
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,422
his friend murdered one of my men

459
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,581
...and when we find him
we're gonna kiII him. TeII him that

460
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:10,818
(M Y CAPTAIN SAYS WE'LL FIND HIM
AND KILL HIM)

461
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,929
(WE AREN'T THE ENEM Y. IT'S SOMETHING ELSE

462
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:18,293
(THERE IS SOMETHING BAD HERE)

463
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,892
He said they're not the enemy. He said...

464
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,971
...there's something wrong
with this pIace, with this trench...

465
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,037
Look he said it's in the earth,
in the ground...

466
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,173
In the ground

467
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,941
They must be using tunneIs to get about

468
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,842
(IT WILL KILL US ALL.
IT WILL KILL YOU AS WELL. PLEASE)

469
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,107
(WE MUST GO)

470
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:34,343
It kiIIed aII of them, it's gonna
kiII us too. He says we shouId Ieave

471
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:40,685
( SOMETHING EVIL HERE. EVIL. EVIL.)

472
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:41,883
MaI. What's that, what's that word?

473
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:44,756
EviI. It means eviI

474
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:04,906
This is Y Company,
and we're stiII aIive...

475
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:10,745
Is anybody there? Anybody?

476
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,449
This is Y Company, and we're stiII aIive

477
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,027
No. No. No, we are aIive!

478
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,200
We are stiII aIive

479
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,336
Bradford

480
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:42,609
Chevasse

481
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,800
Who's there?

482
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,261
Who are you?

483
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:05,668
Who are you?

484
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,243
These Bosch are worse dead than aIive

485
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,520
So what's the point of this?

486
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,617
It's easy to hide in the bodies isn't it

487
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,584
Put them aII in one pIace,
and there's one Iess pIace to hide

488
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,686
That's the Iast of them

489
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,060
Those we can move anyway

490
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,399
So much death

491
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,140
Beggars the imagination

492
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,839
Perhaps you'd Iike to say
a few words, Bradford

493
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,311
The Captain's saying he wants
to hear something from your book

494
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:51,944
Very weII

495
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,400
And the four angeIs were Ioosed...

496
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:07,830
...which were prepared for an hour,
and a day,

497
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,005
and a month, and a year

498
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:12,671
For they were to sIay
the third part of men...

499
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:18,110
...by the fire, by the smoke
and by the brimstone

500
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,941
...which rained down about their heads

501
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,711
We have aII made a covenant with death...

502
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,987
...and with heII we are in agreement

503
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:33,329
Who do you think you are,
the Archbishop of fuckin' Canterbury?

504
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:37,400
Ignore him.
You send one up there for me, aye

505
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:41,065
When the over fIown scourge
shaII pass through...

506
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:43,136
...you shaII be trodden down by it

507
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,519
Are these better than ours?

508
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:02,924
WeII if you're Iooking for a nice Iine
in shrapneI wounds and severed Iimbs. Yeah

509
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,355
ProbabIy a IittIe better

510
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:07,824
Mind you I hear our pineappIes
make a pretty good fruit saIad

511
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:16,805
Why are we doing this?

512
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:23,475
Ah, weII...sometimes it's just better
to be doing something

513
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,040
We know the enemy's stiII here
somewhere, so...

514
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:30,017
Captain teIIs us we have to stay
and hoId the trench, so...

515
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:34,057
...we stay and hoId the trench. That's the
chain of command, we do what we're toId

516
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,051
And what then?

517
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:40,160
AII of us at risk to hoId this pIace,
and we, we don't even know where it is

518
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,359
Or what it is

519
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,560
Right, we've got underground saps
aII aIong here, yeah?

520
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,831
Some of them have got tunneIs

521
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,173
There, there and down there

522
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:54,642
So we just chuck grenades in
and coIIapse the entrances?

523
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:55,871
Yeah, that's about the sum of it

524
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,174
Do you think it wiII work, Sarge?

525
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,305
Why not?

526
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:02,118
Oh, come on.
There's a bad feeIing here. This trench

527
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,877
What you taIking about?

528
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:05,885
Sarge, something isn't right...

529
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,321
What?

530
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:09,686
Nothing

531
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,952
Right, with a bit of Iuck the whoIe thing
wiII cave in and trap him down there

532
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,230
Aye, or drive them out into the open

533
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:17,300
Yeah, either way we've got a resuIt.
AIright?

534
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:17,900
Aye

535
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:18,798
Bradford!

536
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,007
Bradford!

537
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:27,502
TeII Jennings one minute. Go on. Go!

538
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,180
We're ready, sir

539
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:37,185
One minute

540
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,151
Very good. TeII him to proceed

541
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:41,424
One minute

542
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:08,548

Fuck off!

Keep down! Keep down!

562
00:44:57,661 --> 00:44:58,685
Where are they?

563
00:44:58,862 --> 00:44:59,590
They're coming!

564
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,789
Right, here they come

565
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:04,100
Steady boys. Make every buIIet count!

566
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,362
Stay focused

567
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:09,439
Easy

568
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,268
Any second now

569
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,504
Captain!

570
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:21,918
Tate!

571
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:23,449
Tate!

572
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,088
Tate!

573
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,231
Tate!

574
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:39,658
Tate!

575
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:50,769
Tate! Tate!

576
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,174
They're coming!

577
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:00,854
They're coming!

578
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,918
They're coming! Tate, where are you?

579
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,820
Goddamit, where are you?

580
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:17,572
Come on!

581
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:25,237
Who are you?

582
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:56,208
What happened? Huh, put the gun down!

583
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,110
Captain, put the gun down, it's me

584
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,608
Put...put the gun down

585
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:01,949
Cap...

586
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:07,246
Oh, Jesus Christ

587
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:09,516
Captain made his buIIet count, Sarge

588
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:17,430
Oh Jesus...

589
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:24,499
No, no! No,
what's the matter with this pIace?

590
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,605
Where's...where's the army?

591
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,220
Got any words for us now, Archbishop?

592
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,815
Sergeant Tate,
are we spending another night here?

593
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:47,616
Is that a good idea?

594
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:49,953
It's up to the Captain

595
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:53,618
But what wouId you do?

596
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,663
Stay here?

597
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:01,465
There's something wrong
with this pIace, isn't there?

598
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:03,437
Something not right

599
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,137
Look what the Captain did

600
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,705
What happened to Starinski?

601
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:09,945
I don't know what you're taIking about

602
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,506
But the...

603
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:16,444
You heard it

604
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,811
I heard nothing

605
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:19,714
WeII what about the noise?

606
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:21,484
I heard nothing

607
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:23,823
What did you hear, eh?

608
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:25,893
You

609
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,357
You

610
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:41,176
But the prisoner. What he said.
He said we'd turn on each other

611
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,706
What are we gonna do.
I mean we can't just...

612
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:44,872
Shut up!

613
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:50,145
Just...just shut up with your questions

614
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,618
He's the Captain, not me

615
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:54,848
Ask him

616
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,757
Shakespeare, Shakespeare

617
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:02,822
Come here

618
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,172
We shouId Ieave right now

619
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:14,202
Two men dead. Do you want
to add to that, Shakespeare, huh?

620
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,333
Do ya?

621
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:21,545
The Captain says we hoId this trench.
So we're gonna sit tight

622
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,977
You're gonna sit tight

623
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,750
You understand?

624
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,296
LittIe Hun bastards

625
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:15,403
What have you been doin' here, eh?

626
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:59,142
Jesus Christ, Bradford

627
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:02,474
This pIace is scary enough
without you jumping out at me

628
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:09,857
Are you aIright?

629
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:14,063
Good

630
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:15,855

00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,819
Right Bradford, I'm here

634
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:15,753

635
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,404
WeII that's just fuckin' great

636
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,542
Have you come for me, have you?

637
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:46,807
Come on then

638
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:50,081
Is this my time, huh?

639
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:54,187
WeII bring it at me.
You're gonna fuckin' need it

640
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:59,187
No!

641
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:19,138
What the fuck happened to you,
you stupid Scottish bastard?

642
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:20,334

643

646
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:29,915
Leaving!

647
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,146
WeII that's the best idea
I've heard aII day

648
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,919
McNess, you can't Ieave. You know that

649
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,793
Look we'II dig in.
BuiId a strong defensive position

650
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:45,298
Defensive position? What are we
defending against Sergeant, huh? What?

651
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,761
Come on say it. EviI!

It's the gas,

654
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:55,908
Was Starinski haIIucinating, huh?

655
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,808
Is this a fuckin' haIIucination?

656
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,905
There must be another sniper

657
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,017
Germans we haven't found yet

658
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:03,845
I don't know

659
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:07,753
Aye I know you don't know.
You don't know because you won't admit it

660
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:09,347
Fucking none of you

661
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,549
I don't...I don't wanna die

662
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,393
I'm not waiting to die

663
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:16,226
Mcness, pIease don't go out there

664
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:20,166
There's nothing out there. It's in here

665
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:22,635
It's in fuckin' here

666
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:26,438
Where do you think you're going?

667
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,308
Deserters wiII be shot

668
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:44,453
What wouId your father say
if he saw you now?

669
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,427
He'd say naughty boy

670
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:50,562
'Naughty boy' pointing weapons at peopIe

671
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:55,062
I'II put you over my knee and
I'II give you a damn good thrashing

672
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,238
That's what he'd say

673
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:00,740
Give me the gun Captain

674
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:07,742
Give me the gun

675
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:22,891
Remember your fuckin' manners

676
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,762
Remember your fuckin' manners

677
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,996
Don't forget your fuckin' manners

678
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,064
You are under arrest

679
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,634
Mcness!

680
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:55,489
I don't see him

681
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:56,621
Right, hoId on

684
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,799
Jesus, Bradford

685
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:36,935
He's been hit

686
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,439
Where did the shot come from?

687
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:40,236
I'd better go and get him

688
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:41,970
No, I'II get him. You cover me

689
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:42,903
AIright

690
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:45,378
Remember, just keep on the move

691
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:48,751
Right, go!

692
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:29,451
Bradford?

693
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,267
Bradford!

694
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:54,843
Bradford!

695
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,455

700
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,126
Bradford are you down here?

701
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,843

702
01:01:58,581 --> 01:01:59,878

HeIIo CharIie

01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:55,596
Why did you shoot him?

715
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,132
He was trying to Ieave

716
01:02:58,641 --> 01:02:59,835
We have to stay

717
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:07,006

01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:15,006
It's inside me, CharIey. I can feeI it

729
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,048
It's moving around Iike worms in my gut,

730
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:20,247
I can't stop it

731
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:21,520
What?

732
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:23,190
What is it?

733
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:24,450
It's death!

734
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:27,262
And it's waiting for us

735
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:32,533
AII this bIame, this hatred...

736
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:38,867
Come on, Bradford. Come back with me

737
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:42,470
It's in the earth, and the rats,

738
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:45,172
and the fIies, and you and me

739
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:50,380
We're dead, CharIey. I know that now

740
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:54,682
I can't feeI my heart beating anymore

741
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,187
I died here, and I just didn't reaIise it

742
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:04,027
Come on. Come back with me

743
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:06,631
No. You have to stop me

744
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:09,197
I'm not a murderer

745
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:11,798
You wiII be

746
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:18,712
I was wrong, you see. God is dead

747
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:20,574
We're aII aIone

748
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:23,482
Bradford

749
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:28,453
Bradford! Where are we?

750
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:36,354
Tate, barricades won't work.
It didn't heIp the Germans

751
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:39,562
That thing out there took McNess

752
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,734
Right in front of my eyes,
sucked him into the fuckin' mud

753
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:45,271
So what are we gonna do.
Hide round some boxes?

754
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:46,636
Captain

755
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:49,834
Captain we need a hand here

756
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,113
HaIt! Who's there?

757
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:04,623
It's me!

758
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:06,725
It's me

759
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:09,264
Shakespeare, where the heII have you been?

760
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:10,895
Come give us a hand, wiII ya?

761
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:11,989
Sarge

762
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,538
Bradford shot McNess

763
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,408
I saw him do it

764
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:28,948
He shot his own man

765
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:33,721
That's not gonna do us any good, Sergeant

766
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:35,955
Not against what's in here

767
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:40,520
I'm a soIdier, son. I fight
what I can see. What's in front of me

768
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:45,263
But it's not in front of us.
Don't you understand that yet?

769
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:47,168
Look, you're not Iistening

770
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:49,470
You're meant to be in charge

771
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:51,062
Just Iisten to him

772
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:56,267
Oi! Hun! Hun!

773
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:00,511
You wanna kiII me?

774
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:04,109
WeII come on then

775
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:07,222
Come on, come on then!

776
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,316
I'm waiting

777
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,424
Where do you think you're going?

778
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:45,887
I can't Iet Quinn kiII the prisoner

779
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:46,461
You mad?

780
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:49,861
Shakespeare, you don't fight
your own men to save the enemy

781
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,991
But he's not the enemy

782
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:55,494
Look we can't Iet this go on,
not in this pIace

783
01:07:58,908 --> 01:07:59,875
PIease...

784
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:02,500
AIright, I'II bring him back myseIf

785
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:05,438
Out my way, Doc

786
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:10,211
Sergeant Tate?

787
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:11,352
Sir

788
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:13,012

01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:15,487
Sir

790
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:18,525
For inspection,
muster the company if you wouId

791
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:20,362
What about Quinn?

792
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:24,389
There's no company Ieft, sir

793
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:25,925
Nothing to inspect

794
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:27,093
Just foIIow your orders

795
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:28,135
Oh, for God's sake, man...

796
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:29,033
Carry out my orders!

797
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:30,196
This is not the time

798
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:37,506
You are a weak man Sergeant Tate.
I've aIways thought that of you

799
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,872
And you are a streak of posh,
fucking piss sir

800
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:46,914
Captain, no!

801
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:49,286
You are reIieved of your duties

802
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:55,389
Private First CIass Shakespeare,

01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:57,659
CorporaI Fairweather faIIing in

Very good

806
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,736
Doesn't do to Iet standards sIip, CorporaI

807
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:11,540
You have a responsibiIity
to these young men

808
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:12,614
Yes, sir

809
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:17,882
What is that godawfuI racket?

810
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,645
That's Private Quinn, sir

811
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:24,089
And why is he not here for inspection?

812
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:25,984
Sergeant!

813
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:30,858
Why is Private Quinn
not here for inspection?

814
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:36,566
Right. WeII done men, you faII out

815

01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:40,301
PIease, don't do that, sir

817
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:41,533
He'II kiII you, sir

818
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:44,103
I'm an officer

819
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:03,495
Quinn!

820
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:07,295
What do you think you're doing?

821
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:13,532
Take that man down and get back
to the trench for inspection, now

822
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:25,250
And?

823
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:29,689
Take your hands off me

824
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:34,493
You know what I hate most
about this fuckin' war?

825
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:37,496
It's not the mud...

826
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:40,597
...or the coId...

827
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:50,467
...or the wet...

828
01:10:57,453 --> 01:10:58,317
Sarge?

829
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:02,421
Or even the Hun...

830
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:14,032
What have I done?

831
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:16,330
It's the fucking officers

832
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,078
Sarge!

833
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:27,109
Make your peace

834
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:34,150
Quinn! No!

835
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,458
Quinn!

836
01:11:48,037 --> 01:11:49,197
Quinn!

837
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,116
You ain't come to arrest me again have ya?

838
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:09,451
I'm not gonna arrest you, Quinn.
I'm gonna fuckin' kiII ya

839
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:13,853
Oh good, it's about time
you showed some fuckin' boIIocks

840
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,590
CharIey! CharIey!

841
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:49,559
It's too Iate, you can't do anything

842
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:59,604
It wasn't the Hun kiIIed McNess,
it was Bradford

843
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:01,904
That makes sense,

844
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:04,312
the BibIe basher Iosing it out here

845
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:05,912
You don't see it, do ya?

846
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,448
This pIace is making us kiII each other

847
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:13,820
There's nothing making me kiII you

848
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:18,255
Quinn, Quinn, don't do it!
It's wrong, you can't do it

849
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,094
Quinn? Quinn!

850
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:26,466
Quinn! Don't do it, pIease!

851
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:28,570
It's a bit Iate for heroics ain't it?

852
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:36,410
Quinn, there's been enough kiIIing

853
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,541
Not yet there hasn't

854
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:47,884
Quinn, I've got...I've got chiIdren

855
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,631
No!

856
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:04,300
You murderer!

857
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,468
You're just a fuckin' animaI!

858
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:21,456
WeII go on. Go on

859
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:27,523
You haven't got the guts have you?

860
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:29,423
You're a coward

861
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:31,993
You Ieft him to die before

862
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,034
Do you think nobody saw you run away?

863
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:35,569
We aII did!

864
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:38,101
You shouId be shot!

865
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:42,368
You shouId curI up into a IittIe baII...

866
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:44,307
...and shriveI up with shame

867
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:45,903
At Ieast I'm not a murderer

868
01:14:46,048 --> 01:14:50,178
That's aII we do here.
This war is aII murder

869
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:52,114
And do you know what?

870
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:54,547
I Iove it

871
01:14:57,559 --> 01:14:58,685
You're a coward

872
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:37,595
Shoot!

873
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:50,443
Fuck it!

874
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:54,038

What are you doing, Bradford?
Why are you doing this?

918
01:19:34,703 --> 01:19:35,727
Is it because of me?

919
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:38,235
Because I don't beIieve?
I do beIieve, I swear to God

920
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,102
Liar!

921
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:46,544
Everyone Ioses it in this war

01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:49,145

928
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:25,745
What about forgiveness,

929
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:30,422
Be not overcome by eviI
but overcome eviI. With good...

930
01:20:30,525 --> 01:20:32,015

Where is this?

966
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:35,896

I'm not dead!

971
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:45,794
I'm not dead!

972
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:26,900
AIIemand!

973
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:36,776

974
01:27:41,689 --> 01:27:42,917
