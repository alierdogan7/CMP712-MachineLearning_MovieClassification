1
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,400
Hey, Halphen... Going to Epernay?

2
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,080
- When?
- In half an hour.

3
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,080
In your truck?... Give me a ride.

4
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,630
- Sure...Josephine?
- Of course!

5
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,520
- You're not the only one.
- Big deal!

6
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,620
Say, Maréchal...
You have to take up a staff officer.

7
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,540
He's picked the wrong time.

8
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,290
-Josephine again?
- Yeah, Josephine.

9
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,180
Where will all that get you?

10
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,350
She'll just have to wait.

11
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,990
Liquor kills!
Liquor drives you crazy!

12
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,230
The squadron leader drinks it!

13
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,870
Captain de Boeldieu.
Staff officer, division...

14
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,130
Do you know this photo, Mr. Maréchal?

15
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,940
Sure. Ricord took it with me.

16
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,560
And where can I find Mr. Ricord?

17
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,620
- On leave.
- Of course.

18
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,130
This gray smudge worries me...

19
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,210
Here, just below the road.

20
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,170
- That's not a road, it's a canal.
- No, a railway.

21
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,210
Such unanimity
honors our aerial cameras.

22
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,840
It was a foggy day.

23
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,250
I'd like to resolve this enigma.

24
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,000
I'll request a plane.

25
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,910
I'll go get ready, sir.

26
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,630
Flying suit or fur jacket?

27
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,960
No preference.
Flying suits smell, fur jackets shed.

28
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,330
Get me the fighter squadron.

29
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,200
Take a car to the sugar refinery.

30
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,470
I just shot down a Caudron fighter.

31
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,120
If they're Officers,

32
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,650
invite them for lunch.

33
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,130
Freisler...

34
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,450
make us one of your famous
fruit punches

35
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,200
to celebrate the downing
of my twelfth plane.

36
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,090
Three bottles of Moselle...
two Rhine...

37
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,330
half a bottle of Martel...

38
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,940
three bubbly...

39
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,880
two seltzer...

40
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,150
pineapples...

41
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,960
Two officers. One is wounded.
I took him to the infirmary.

42
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,300
Captain von Rauffenstein,
CO, 21 st Squadron.

43
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,130
Captain de Boeldieu, staff officer.

44
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,250
Lt. Maréchal, pilot.

45
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,370
My apologies.

46
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,800
My officers.

47
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,440
I am honored to have French guests.

48
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,310
Now, gentlemen, let us eat.

49
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,100
Orderly, coats!

50
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,740
Freisler, your punch...

51
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,780
May I serve you?

52
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,880
I knew a Boeldieu in Berlin...

53
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,900
a Count de Boeldieu.

54
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,290
My cousin, Edmond de Boeldieu.

55
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,020
He was military attaché.

56
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,150
He's a fighter pilot now.

57
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,190
Aren't you eating?

58
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,560
I can't cut the meat.

59
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,900
- May I?
- Please do.

60
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,690
You speak good French.

61
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,370
I was a mechanic in Lyons.

62
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,130
No kidding!
Me too, I'm a mecha...

63
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,070
To Captain de Crussol,
French Flying Corps,

64
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,960
shotdown in flames...

65
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,130
From the Officers
ofthe German 21st Squadron.

66
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,750
I'm sorry about this coincidence.

67
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,390
May the earth lie lightly
on our valiant enemy.

68
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,440
I have orders to take custody
of the captured officers.

69
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,870
PRISONER-OF-WAR CAMP N1 7
OFFICERS' CAMP

70
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,160
Read these gentlemen
the camp regulations.

71
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:16,330
"Officers will be treated
with the consideration due their rank."

72
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,620
"However, you are reminded
that you are subject to German law."

73
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:25,680
"You therefore must obey
the rules of German discipline."

74
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,090
"Any German soldier here
has the right to give you orders

75
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,710
which must be obeyed without protest."

76
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,320
"You must salute Officers
according to German army regulations."

77
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:42,220
"If you attempt to escape,
sentries have orders to fire on officers

78
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,140
found outside camp limits."

79
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,730
"Incorrect dress is not permitted."

80
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,400
"Large crowds are forbidden.
You may not insult the German people,

81
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,240
"or write or speak to civilians
from outside the camp."

82
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,780
"It is forbidden
to speak to the sentries."

83
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,250
Gentlemen, we will now proceed
with some minor formalities.

84
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,200
Russian nouns are declined
just like in Latin.

85
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,210
- Newcomers.
- Let's warn them.

86
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,780
Angel of purity, angel of light!

87
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,140
Hide your valuables...

88
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,460
- What are they singing?
- To hide our valuables.

89
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,650
Don't touch!
Those belong to me.

90
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,050
I've got nothing, old man.

91
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,450
Had I known,
I'd have brought some cash.

92
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,330
This conduct is unbecoming.

93
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,720
Sorry, it's our duty to search you.
This is war.

94
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,340
I perfectly agree,
but conduct it courteously.

95
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,220
If not, I'll see
your commanding officer.

96
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,360
How are you - kulele?
Lucky you - calyptus!

97
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,760
Here, Müller, have some chocolate.

98
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,220
You've no right to open my ham!

99
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,290
It's in the regulations.
I read them carefully.

100
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,330
It's rotten! You can have it!

101
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,660
He's hard to please.

102
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,790
I'm delighted when my folks
send a parcel.

103
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,160
Here we are,
in the heart of Germany,

104
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,750
cut off from our families by the front,

105
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,920
and here's a can of peas,
direct from Paris.

106
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,370
Is it all right?

107
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,450
I'm amazed at how honest
our jailers are with our parcels.

108
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:38,540
It's true!
Take our feldwebel, Arthur...

109
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,590
He eats cabbage every day.
It sticks in his craw. He told me so.

110
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,620
He'd much rather lay into your peas.

111
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,690
Don't kid yourselves.

112
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,920
If they did that,
our parcels would stop coming.

113
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,000
They're short of food for themselves.

114
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,210
Hurry, our guests will be hungry.

115
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,010
This tastes like an old sock!

116
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,220
What do they feed the French?

117
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,350
Cabbage, but they have their parcels.

118
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,680
- And the Russians?
- Cabbage roots, but no parcels.

119
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,230
And the English?

120
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,430
I was on the stage before the war...

121
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,870
in vaudeville.

122
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,680
- Ever see me?
- Theater's too deep for me.

123
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,340
I prefer bicycling.

124
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,200
You follow the Tour de France?

125
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,380
You must've heard of Fabert,
Garrigoud, Petit Breton...

126
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,880
Can we purchase what we like?

127
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,930
Yes, through the canteen.

128
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,570
Fine, I'll buy myself
a comfortable armchair...

129
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,610
playing cards, a few books,
English cigarettes.

130
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,240
You won't find those.

131
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,890
There you go, sir.
I'll come again tomorrow.

132
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,390
Gentlemen, time to eat.

133
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,000
Sir...

134
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,350
So, gentlemen,
what shall we begin with?

135
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,280
Chicken, foie gras,

136
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,450
or Captain Cook mackerel?

137
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,240
You're well provisioned.

138
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,420
Don't they feed us here?

139
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,620
In theory, they do,
but what they give us is inedible.

140
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,220
Fortunately, we have our parcels,
especially our friend Rosenthal's.

141
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,590
Oh, please!

142
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,480
A cognac to start with, sir?

143
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,640
I've never eaten so well in my life.

144
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,120
Some fish?

145
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,630
I'm getting used to
Rosenthal's kindness.

146
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,520
Man is such an adaptable creature.

147
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,390
You can see he's a professor...

148
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,570
Profess her... Confess her...

149
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,900
Address her... undress her...

150
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,500
Oops, a slip!

151
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,490
You're quite a joker!

152
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,070
Is that supposed to be witty?

153
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,220
He's hard to please!

154
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,130
Let's drink to peace!

155
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,310
Not bad, this cognac.

156
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,170
Comes from Fouquet's
in mouthwash bottles.

157
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,700
Fouquet's?

158
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,740
It's a bar on the Champs-Elysées.

159
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:18,540
When I went to Paris, I ate
at my brother-in-law's. It's cheaper.

160
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,520
- Been to Paris lately?
- Last week.

161
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,920
Lucky man! Places crowded?

162
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,470
Maxim's was packed.

163
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,940
I never go to places like that...

164
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,880
I prefer a nice little bar...
with good wine.

165
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,160
- Maxim's... don't know it either.
- It's no great loss.

166
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,050
We know you eat
at your brother-in-law's...

167
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,730
He never lets up!

168
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,880
Is he there, "Mr. Monocle"?

169
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:52,880
No, he's not.

170
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,100
I've just been to the canteen.
It's about his armchair request...

171
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,240
Let him tighten his belt!

172
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,620
I'll tell him.

173
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,530
He's nice, the guy with the parcels.
Well off?

174
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,760
And how!
You know the Rosenthal bank?

175
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,450
His parents.

176
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,260
Am I tickling you?

177
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,300
- And what's he do?
- Runs a big fashion house.

178
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,850
Funny.
With his money, I wouldn't...

179
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,130
What do you do in civilian life?

180
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,870
I'm a engineer for the cadaster.

181
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,310
Sure, the cadaster...

182
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,910
just between us...
can we trust your pal, the Captain?

183
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,480
He may seem strange,
but he's okay.

184
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,530
You can trust him all right.

185
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,240
- It's all right, then.
- Why?

186
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,480
You see, after dark...
we're digging a tunnel.

187
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,650
What for?

188
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,200
To escape.

189
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,020
What do you dig with?

190
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,580
A coal shovel, old food cans...

191
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,030
I calculate
we should come up in a garden

192
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,230
behind those buildings there.
It's open country.

193
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,960
That's slow work.

194
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,900
We've been at it for two months.
just a few more weeks...

195
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,970
The war'll be over first.

196
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,050
You're deluding yourself.

197
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,010
Think so?

198
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,370
Best to be prepared.

199
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,720
Where's the tunnel?

200
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,230
You'll see tonight, after roll call.

201
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,460
So you're digging a hole...

202
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,490
Like Monte Cristo. What a laugh!

203
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,530
- Thanks for the wash.
- You can't do it with your arm.

204
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,920
Mind if I ask you something?

205
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,130
Go ahead.

206
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,410
What's a "cadaster"?

207
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,570
- Maréchal.
- Present.

208
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,640
- Boeldieu.
- Captain de Boeldieu.

209
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,410
- Cartier.
- Here...we go again!

210
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,620
Good night, Arthur!

211
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,540
- Whose turn is it?
- Cartier's.

212
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,440
What's that for?

213
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,380
For breathing.
These are to extend the line.

214
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,750
And the bags?

215
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,610
For removing earth.

216
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,030
This is the alarm.

217
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,400
If I start to suffocate,
I yank on the string...

218
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,750
The can falls...

219
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:57,420
And the boys pull me out by the feet...

220
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,020
The feet...

221
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,000
What are you waiting for?

222
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,390
Watch me play the mole...

223
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,580
mol-asses!

224
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,440
Is the tunnel safe?

225
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,900
It's shored up with wood
from the theater.

226
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,520
And the earth?

227
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,520
Stuffed under the floorboards.

228
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,400
But there's not an inch of space left.

229
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,750
Now we fill bags and empty them
during exercise.

230
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,850
Hear that?

231
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,570
I'm sure I heard something.

232
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,250
It's nothing.

233
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,350
Listen...

234
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,280
We'll send someone out
to check.

235
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,720
You've got an innocent face.
Go take a peek outside.

236
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,150
I'll pretend to go to the latrine.

237
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,650
Say, Arthur, what happened?

238
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,150
The fellow tried to escape.

239
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,670
We caught him in the garden
behind those buildings...

240
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,280
We opened fire.

241
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,190
Behind the buildings?

242
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,600
- Is he dead?
- I think so.

243
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,260
And you, what are you doing out?

244
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,850
Going to the latrine.

245
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,480
- What was it?
- Someone tried to escape.

246
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,850
He got as far as the garden
behind the buildings.

247
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,310
A sentry shot him.

248
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,240
He's dead.

249
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,480
The alarm!

250
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,360
- No answer.
- Pull him out.

251
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,350
Hurt bad?

252
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,480
Drink some cognac.

253
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,380
From Fouquet's.

254
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,400
Here's mud in your eye.
Don't drop the bottle.

255
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,450
Who goes down tomorrow?

256
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,330
You do, sir... if you don't mind.

257
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,420
My pleasure. I understand
crawling is fine exercise.

258
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,300
I remind you it is strictly forbidden

259
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,050
to receive non-military clothing.

260
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,700
Good news?

261
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,050
It's from my aunt in Bordeaux.
People are swarming into town.

262
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,750
What do you think?

263
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,480
They'd better watch out,

264
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,130
the Germans are claiming
a major breakthrough.

265
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,800
There's been no bell-ringing
so it can't mean much.

266
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,320
Up for some gardening?

267
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,820
I hate the way
German bulletins exaggerate.

268
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,420
And our papers don't?

269
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,370
Remember the "Russian steamroller"?

270
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,940
Isn't it time we got down
to serious business?

271
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,930
Sure, but not all at once.

272
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,430
And that famous General "Winter",

273
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,210
so lethal to the nasty Krauts

274
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,550
but so tonic to the Allies...

275
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,130
And do you remember "Turpinite"?

276
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:50,410
A flask the size of... a radish
that could blow up a whole battalion.

277
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:54,570
They even tried it on a flock of sheep.

278
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,900
Too bad they didn't stop at that.

279
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,170
- What're you guys planting?
- Dandelions.

280
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,570
I'm dreaming of dandelion salad.

281
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,890
The war'll be over
before your dandelions grow.

282
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,100
This singular exercise
will give us workman's hands.

283
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,710
The trunks are here!

284
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,210
- The costumes?
- At the theater.

285
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:26,630
There should be a trunk
with women's clothes.

286
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,360
Coming, sir?

287
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:32,180
My theatrical skills are questionable.
Besides, I'm engaged.

288
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,300
- Playing patience?
- Exactly. I'm a realist.

289
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,960
Find anything, Arthur?

290
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,920
Nothing.

291
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,150
Well, gentlemen, enjoy yourselves.

292
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,430
Where will we put all this?

293
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
I asked for hangers.

294
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,830
Be careful...

295
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,010
These things
should be handled with care...

296
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,600
with your eyes closed.

297
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,130
Looks like a little girl's dress.

298
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,430
Dresses are short now.

299
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,790
just below the knee.

300
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,280
So I hear. I'd love to see that!

301
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,690
Then put it on.

302
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,130
Not him, he never shaves.

303
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:06,030
- You have an angel face, Maisonneuve.
- Anything to amuse.

304
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,030
We have to take inventory.

305
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,440
The corset, too!

306
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:15,780
Take it easy.

307
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,980
It's not only the dresses.
They wear their hair short, too.

308
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,390
Short hair!

309
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,920
It's like sleeping with a boy!

310
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,870
When we're not around,
women act foolish.

311
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,560
I'm sure my wife hasn't cut her hair.

312
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,050
That's for high-class floozies.

313
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,130
How would you know,
with that mug?

314
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,840
- Shoes!
- How small they are!

315
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,160
Stockings.

316
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,750
Stockings of sheerest silk!

317
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,150
Hey, fellas, I'm ready!

318
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,610
Let us dream a bit first.

319
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,200
You'll only stifle our imagination.

320
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,250
Look at that!

321
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,630
Black stockings!

322
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,500
Looks like a real girl!

323
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,010
Funny, huh?

324
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,120
Doesn't it look funny?

325
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,370
Yeah, sure looks funny.

326
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,310
Poor boys.

327
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,900
Enjoy yourselves.

328
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,770
Out there, children play soldier...

329
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,930
In here, soldiers play like children.

330
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,290
I wish I knew what's going on
back home.

331
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,710
- No news?
- Nothing.

332
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,150
I don't care what my missus is up to.

333
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:36,810
I want out
'cause I'm bored stiff... bored!

334
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,280
So you want to escape for the fun of it.

335
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,210
Right!

336
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,790
For me, it's the spirit
of contradiction.

337
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:48,970
They won't let me fight,
so I'm dying to.

338
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,880
I hate being here
when others are biting the dust.

339
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,450
For me it's simple.

340
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:58,190
A golf course is for golf.
A tennis court for tennis.

341
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,840
A prison camp is for escaping.

342
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,950
And you, Rosenthal, the sportsman...

343
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,610
Him? He was born in Jerusalem.

344
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:10,800
No, in Vienna. To a Danish mother
and a Polish father, naturalized French.

345
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,060
Old Celtic aristocracy!

346
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:18,290
Yet for all your French roots, none
of you owns an acre of your country.

347
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,450
In 35 years,
the Rosenthals have acquired

348
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,230
three chateaux with hunting preserves,

349
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,050
farms, orchards, warrens, stud farms,

350
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,700
and 3 galleries of bona fide ancestors.

351
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,840
If that's not worth escaping
to fight for!

352
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:37,540
I'd never considered patriotism
from such an unusual angle.

353
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,780
With all those game preserves,

354
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,730
your lackeys must
really stuff themselves.

355
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,350
I got into the war in a funny way.

356
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:49,160
I became a soldier
because I'm a vegetarian.

357
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,350
That's right.
My brother and I had stomach ailments.

358
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,670
The doctor warned us
against eating meat.

359
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,550
I turned vegetarian and got well.

360
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,270
My brother went on eating meat,

361
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,740
got sick and was invalided out.

362
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:10,780
Your citations show vegetarianism
didn't interfere with duty.

363
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,510
Or stop my wife from cheating on me.

364
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,630
You have to admit it's stirring.

365
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,240
I loathe fifes.

366
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,870
Still, it gets to you.

367
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,390
It's not the music that gets to you...

368
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,650
It's the marching feet.

369
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:58,150
Thanks to your dumb talk
I ruined my pants...

370
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:19,390
FORT DOUAUMONT TAKEN!

371
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,040
What about our show?
Do we still put it on?

372
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,730
You bet we do!
All the more reason.

373
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,960
In fact we should invite
the German Officers.

374
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:02,730
Although I won't join
in your artistic endeavors, Maréchal,

375
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,310
let me congratulate you...
That's the spirit!

376
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,690
Have you met Marguerite
She's neither tall nor petite

377
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,630
With eyes that glow, skin like snow
And lips in a cupid's bow

378
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,850
Well, when this divine creation
Heard my ardent declaration

379
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:47,600
She gave me a rose, tweaked my nose
Saying, "I'll give you joy"

380
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:51,680
I said, "Thanks all the same
But that's not why I came"

381
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:55,400
If you want to give me joy

382
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:58,800
Marguerite, Marguerite

383
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,340
If you want to give me joy

384
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,350
Make me your loverboy

385
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,130
'Neath her window I waited

386
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,050
And then I serenaded:

387
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:15,440
"My soul's apyre
since your eyes set my heart on fire!"

388
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,410
So this sweet and caring dame
To put out my raging flame

389
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:24,010
Did a bucket spill from her sill
Asking, "Is it burning still?"

390
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:28,640
I said, "Thanks all the same
But that's not why I came"

391
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,560
If you want to give me joy

392
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,110
Marguerite, let me be your loverboy

393
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,800
All together now!

394
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,190
And now... direct from Paris!

395
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,840
Get it, Arthur?

396
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,090
Stop the show! Stop the show!

397
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,090
Stop, fellas!

398
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,800
We've retaken Douaumont!
It's in the German papers.

399
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,600
A little hole, to escape.

400
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,820
GERMAN TROOPS
RECAPTURE DOUAUMONT

401
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,160
Isn't that awful?

402
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,080
Can't be much left of it!

403
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,760
Get off my back!
I can't take it any more! I'm fed up!

404
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:09,520
I want to see some light!

405
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,190
It stinks of shit in here!
Hear me? It stinks of shit!

406
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,390
And I want to hear a voice.

407
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,500
I want to hear a French voice.

408
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,000
What was he yelling about?

409
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:42,560
The war's too long.

410
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,600
If my calculations are right,

411
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:58,420
we should be under the garden wall
in four days.

412
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,470
That's a lot of dirt!

413
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,780
Now that we may get away

414
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:08,620
and reach home again,
I'm afraid of what's waiting for me.

415
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,240
There's more than one woman on earth!

416
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,550
Not for me.

417
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,690
That's why she cheats on you.

418
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,730
One thing upsets me:
leaving Maréchal behind.

419
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:21,100
It weighs on me as well.

420
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,850
In fact... it disturbs me.

421
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,810
But that's war. No room for sentiment.

422
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,770
Glad to see you, old man.

423
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:44,200
We are, too.
Wait until you hear why.

424
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,740
You old dog!

425
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,290
Got anything to eat? I'm hungry.

426
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:55,560
Have a seat.
Rosenthal's getting some grub ready.

427
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,140
What time is it?

428
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,320
11 o'clock.

429
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,480
Time's dragging today.

430
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,850
Sure, but tonight it's aufwiedersehen!

431
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,210
So, we meet in Amsterdam?

432
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,570
I'm keen to see Holland,
for the tulips.

433
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:23,240
What about the cheese?
Don't you like Dutch cheese?

434
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:27,660
Sure, but they say the tulip fields
stretch for miles.

435
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,410
You have the instincts of a shop girl.

436
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,640
Assembly at three o'clock.

437
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:39,880
All Officers are to change camps.

438
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,670
Get your things ready.

439
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:04,620
Gentlemen,
I wish you a pleasant journey.

440
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:08,560
I hope you will see
your wives again soon.

441
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,070
We ought to alert them.

442
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,880
About the tunnel.

443
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:54,440
Sir, there's a tunnel in Barrack 7.

444
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,530
Open the window.
It stinks in here!

445
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:37,510
Sir, may I point out there are
only two pairs of white gloves left.

446
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,260
We can't get any gloves here.

447
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,980
Try to make them last.

448
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:47,070
Yes, sir... More coffee, sir?

449
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,520
If you call this muck coffee,
I have to accept it.

450
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:56,490
At least it warms my insides.

451
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,480
The list of new prisoners, sir.

452
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,220
Three new officer POWs reporting, sir!

453
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:56,200
Delighted to see you again, Boeldieu.

454
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:03,110
But I'm sorry to see you here.

455
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:04,840
We feel the same.

456
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:08,970
Sit down, gentlemen.

457
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,760
No, thank you, sir.

458
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:12,490
As you wish.

459
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,490
Captain de Boeldieu,

460
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,850
four escape attempts:

461
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:32,300
Through a heating duct,
in a garbage bin,

462
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:36,010
via the sewers,
in a laundry basket.

463
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,310
One must lower oneself,
at times.

464
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,640
I understand.

465
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:44,960
Lieutenant Maréchal,
five attempts at escape:

466
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,520
Disguised as a chimney sweep...

467
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,210
Correction, sir:
heating engineer.

468
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,550
Disguised as a German soldier,

469
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,610
disguised as a woman.

470
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:57,320
Amusing, very amusing.

471
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:02,850
But less so when an NCO
tried to pick me up. That I didn't like!

472
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,550
Indeed?

473
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:06,370
I assure you.

474
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:10,880
Lieutenant Demolder,
three attempts...

475
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:19,120
Gentlemen, I respect
your patriotism and courage.

476
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:25,490
But the situation
is completely different here.

477
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,540
No one escapes from this fortress.

478
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,390
You understand me, don't you?

479
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:38,920
So as not to be accused
of German barbarism,

480
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:43,090
I have decided to apply
French regulations.

481
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:50,630
Look them over.

482
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:54,370
They make good bedtime reading.

483
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,240
And now, gentlemen,
if you will follow me...

484
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:06,500
Oswald! My coat.

485
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,790
My soldiers aren't young,

486
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:29,310
but they enjoy playing soldier.

487
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:51,180
We have 25 more guns like this one.

488
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:56,840
I suppose you know the Maxim gun?

489
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:58,380
Very well, sir.

490
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,800
But I prefer the restaurant.

491
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:03,400
Touché!

492
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,990
12th century.

493
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:37,260
Excuse me, sir...

494
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:41,670
Was this villa built specially
for Captain de Boeldieu and myself?

495
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:45,420
Are we your only boarders?

496
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:52,200
Your comrades are back there.

497
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,020
13th century.

498
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,550
A 120-foot drop.

499
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:23,780
So kind of you
to show us around the grounds.

500
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,840
It's such a nice castle, sir.

501
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,040
It's so old...

502
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,260
And so cheerful.

503
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:47,090
Sorry I can't give you
a room to yourself.

504
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,180
I'm touched,
but I'd never have accepted.

505
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,770
I hope our walk
didn't weary you too much.

506
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,980
Not at all, sir, we're fine.

507
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:13,510
- 14th century.
- Pure Gothic.

508
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,960
If you don't mind, gentlemen...

509
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:23,890
Your friend Lt. Rosenthal,
from the Hallbach camp, is here.

510
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:28,300
- Not old Rosenthal!
- He wasn't any luckier.

511
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:32,840
The commandant has put you all
in the same room.

512
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:35,790
That way you'll eat better.

513
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,180
That's very nice of him.

514
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:42,120
A mere formality.

515
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,670
- I caught it with a brunette.
- Who can you trust?

516
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,800
A friend of my mother's.
Quite respectable. She did charity work.

517
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,900
In good society it's usually the pox.

518
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:06,080
Right, Boeldieu?

519
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:10,280
The pox used to be our privilege.
But we've lost it.

520
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:11,940
Like so many others.

521
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:13,820
Everything is popularized.

522
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,930
Cancer and gout
aren't working-class diseases,

523
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:20,230
but they will be, believe me.

524
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,120
How about intellectuals?

525
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,190
With us it's tuberculosis.

526
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,990
Here's Mr. Pindar.

527
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,590
And the middle class?

528
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,660
Liver and intestinal ailments...
They eat too much.

529
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:33,510
We'd each die
of our own class diseases,

530
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,540
if war didn't make all germs equal.

531
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,050
Your dictionaries are in my way.

532
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,490
Excuse me,

533
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:43,950
but Pindar has always been
so badly translated.

534
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:46,590
A lamentable oversight.
I'm so sorry.

535
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:50,990
Not that I care,
but who's this guy Pindar?

536
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:54,560
Go on, joke! But Pindar
means more to me than anything...

537
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:56,900
More than you, the war, my life!

538
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:00,650
Pindar is the greatest Greek poet.

539
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:03,110
The greatest Greek poet?

540
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:05,320
You don't say...

541
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:09,930
There! My map'sj ust about finished.

542
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,760
See... this is where we are...

543
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,460
16 miles above this bend
in the Main River.

544
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,800
To reach Switzerland
above Lake Constance

545
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,310
and avoid the Rhine,
we'd have to travel...

546
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:28,170
- 200 miles.
- No kidding!

547
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:33,360
That means walking 15 nights on 6 lumps
of sugar and 2 biscuits a day.

548
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:39,150
You and your map, you're as crazy
as him and his Pindar. To escape...

549
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:41,640
There! My picture's finished.

550
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,900
"Justice Pursuing Crime."

551
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,920
It came out all right.

552
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,070
Look, to reach this Constance place...

553
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:59,460
Will it hold?

554
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:02,950
It can hold 10 of you and 5 like me.

555
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,730
They're searching the rooms!

556
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:13,030
- Under the mattress, quick!
- No, under mine!

557
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,830
That won't do.

558
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,810
It's childish.

559
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:18,660
May I?

560
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:29,960
Now there's an idea!

561
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:32,260
A convenient little gutter.

562
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,780
Here they are!

563
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,160
Gentlemen... inspection.

564
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:54,320
"Louise wrote to Victor:

565
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,730
I am as weary as a girl
after 22 nights of love."

566
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,280
22 nights of love, imagine that!

567
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:34,790
Continue!

568
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:43,080
Not that corner!

569
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,730
Give me your word that you've nothing
in here against regulations.

570
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:57,630
You have my word.

571
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:01,070
But why my word and not theirs?

572
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,870
The word of a...

573
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,590
Rosenthal...

574
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:10,600
and a Maréchal?

575
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:12,910
It's as good as ours.

576
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:15,880
Perhaps.

577
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:26,050
No, not that!

578
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,050
It's very rare.

579
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,280
Poor old Pindar!

580
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:45,800
They really are stupid.

581
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,460
Everything go all right in here?

582
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:06,790
- Not bad.
- For us, too.

583
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,760
And how is your cousin,
Edmond de Boeldieu,

584
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,850
the military attaché I met in Berlin?

585
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,910
He's doing well. He's very happy.

586
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:35,720
He lost an arm
and married a rich woman.

587
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,450
A truly fine career.

588
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:48,260
Recognize her?

589
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:57,960
Sit down.

590
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,360
Let me tell you something...

591
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:02,980
Believe me,

592
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,900
my present functions

593
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,420
revolt me as much as they do you.

594
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:10,600
That's being harsh.

595
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:12,870
I used to be a combatant.

596
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:17,470
Now I'm a bureaucrat, a policeman.

597
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:20,840
But it's the only way

598
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,950
I can still appear to be

599
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:27,170
serving my fatherland.

600
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,880
I have burns all over...
That explains my gloves.

601
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:36,360
My spine is fractured in two places.

602
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,950
A silver plate.

603
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,180
In my kneecap, too.

604
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,900
I owe these riches
to the misfortunes of war.

605
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:51,820
- May I ask you a question?
- Of course.

606
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:55,310
Why did you make

607
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:57,540
an exception of me

608
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,560
by inviting me here?

609
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:04,510
Because your name is Boeldieu,
career officer in the French Army.

610
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:09,380
And I am Rauffenstein, career officer
in the German Imperial Army.

611
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,130
But my comrades are Officers, as well.

612
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:16,180
A Maréchal and a Rosenthal, Officers?

613
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,030
They're fine soldiers.

614
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:20,900
Charming legacy
of the French Revolution.

615
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:26,080
Neither you nor I
can stop the march of time.

616
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,530
Boeldieu...

617
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:31,330
I don't know who will win this war,

618
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:34,020
but whatever the outcome,

619
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:38,050
it will mean the end of
the Rauffensteins and the Boeldieus.

620
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,880
We're no longer needed.

621
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:42,350
Isn't that a pity?

622
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:43,850
Perhaps.

623
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:50,700
I admire the way
you tend your geranium.

624
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:53,920
Don't think I've become a botanist,

625
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:57,860
but it's the only flower
in the fortress.

626
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:03,620
Nothing grows here but ivy and nettles.

627
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:06,820
I'm glad I'm leaving with you.

628
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:08,000
With us.

629
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:11,010
Sure, I like Boeldieu, but...

630
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:14,120
With him...

631
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:18,240
I never really feel at ease.

632
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:22,410
Different backgrounds...
There's a wall between us.

633
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:23,820
He's a terrific guy.

634
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:26,430
Sure, and he's on the level, but...

635
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:30,530
Suppose you and I were on the skids.

636
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,040
We'd just be two bums.

637
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:33,800
If it happened to him,

638
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,220
he'd still be "Monsieur de Boeldieu."

639
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:39,250
Anyway, you've been terrific, too,

640
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,060
feeding us with your parcels.

641
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:43,850
That's all vanity.

642
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:47,080
I'm really proud to come
from a rich family.

643
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:51,070
Inviting you to my table
is my way of showing it.

644
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:53,410
Most people think we're stingy.

645
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,820
Wrong. We're often generous.

646
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:58,560
Unfortunately, along with that quality,

647
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:01,380
Jehovah gave us an overdose of pride.

648
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:04,000
To hell with Jehovah!

649
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:06,540
All I know is you've been a real pal.

650
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:14,850
We've received a large crate,

651
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:17,250
a gift from our Czarina.

652
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:20,840
Please come and share it with us.

653
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,940
From the Czarina? Must be caviar.

654
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:27,460
- Coming, Boeldieu? They've got vodka.
- Vodka? Lead on.

655
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:35,810
Now we can pay you back
for all your kindness.

656
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:39,700
The Czarina is always good-hearted.

657
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:41,930
Quite a lady, your Czarina.

658
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:01,480
Think of what's in store!

659
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:21,130
"Principles of Algebra"...
"Elementary Ethics"... "Grammar"...

660
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:22,700
A cook book!

661
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:25,130
Something to sink your teeth into!

662
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:27,370
What a farce!

663
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:29,600
Let's go before something happens.

664
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,140
Goodbye, thanks anyway.

665
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:55,980
- The Cossacks aren't happy!
- Let's get out of here!

666
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:02,440
You have no right to burn books!

667
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,580
It's crazy sending us books!

668
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:21,960
The sentries are busy with the Russians.

669
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,740
It's a long drop here,
but it's unguarded.

670
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:27,970
If only we'd been ready!
What a chance!

671
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:30,930
- Especially at night!
- We'll try again.

672
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,890
It was kind of them
to hold a rehearsal for us.

673
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:39,500
Now we know if one man
can divert them for 5 minutes,

674
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:41,280
his comrades can escape.

675
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,940
- Too risky!
- You're exaggerating.

676
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:48,010
It would amuse me.

677
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:50,500
When do you want to go?

678
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,450
Why us? You're in it, too.

679
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,430
Why not? Don't you trust us?

680
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:02,380
- That wouldn't stop me.
- Well then?

681
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,550
A plan like yours
can only work with two men.

682
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:08,000
And I know your preference.

683
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:10,540
- It's not fair.
- What's fair in war?

684
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:12,590
We can't accept that.

685
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:14,500
I'm not asking you...

686
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:16,330
I'm telling you.

687
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,930
The arts aren't forbidden here.

688
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:22,350
You like music?

689
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:24,650
So-so... I like a good waltz.

690
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:26,220
I love the flute.

691
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,610
Here's the program:
We buy flutes for everyone.

692
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:33,290
On the given day:
concert in all the rooms at 5 p.m.

693
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:35,180
That's when night falls.

694
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:38,280
Five minutes later,
they confiscate our flutes.

695
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:40,360
At 5:15,

696
01:07:40,910 --> 01:07:43,630
another concert
with anything at hand:

697
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:46,030
saucepans, animal noises,

698
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:48,650
grinding teeth, whatever...

699
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:52,640
Result: assembly in the courtyard.

700
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:53,960
Then what?

701
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:59,200
That's my concern.
You'll have five minutes...

702
01:08:00,590 --> 01:08:03,040
to clear the walls and reach the woods.

703
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,410
Look, Boeldieu,

704
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:09,310
I don't know how to put it,
but I feel awful about this.

705
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:11,720
- Come now!
- Yes, awful.

706
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:17,000
I'd like to say something...

707
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:20,130
Pour some warm water
over my gloves, will you?

708
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:26,090
Whatever happens,
I want you to know that...

709
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:29,160
I'm not doing this for you personally.

710
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:32,430
So we needn't get mawkish.

711
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:34,920
Go on.

712
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:38,120
But there are times in life...

713
01:08:38,290 --> 01:08:40,330
Let's avoid them, shall we?

714
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:43,460
Excuse me...

715
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:54,860
So you'll be wearing those?

716
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:56,360
Any objections?

717
01:08:56,530 --> 01:09:00,680
No, but white gloves
for this sort of thing, what an idea!

718
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,540
To each his own style.

719
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,840
You can't do anything
like other people.

720
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:12,200
We've been together
eighteen months,

721
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:14,370
and you still stand on ceremony.

722
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:17,960
I'm the same with my mother
and my wife.

723
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,480
In that case...

724
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:27,720
No thanks, English tobacco
gives me a sore throat.

725
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:31,460
No doubt about it: gloves, tobacco...

726
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,190
We've got nothing in common.

727
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:38,830
Say what you like,

728
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:42,860
but where there are Germans,
there is order.

729
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:46,910
Sure, the old man is a bit mad

730
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:49,480
with his flower pot and all...

731
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:53,700
A good thing I'm here
to keep those scoundrels in check.

732
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:56,360
I was a teacher back home.

733
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:19,180
Lieutenant, confiscate
those damned flutes at once!

734
01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:29,640
I advise you not to start again!

735
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,800
We'll do just that in 15 minutes.

736
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:48,490
Order executed, sir.

737
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:00,640
You see? It worked.

738
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:05,130
Put them on bread and water
for three days. And no parcels.

739
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:08,160
Ready, boys... Two seconds...

740
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:21,260
Assembly!

741
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,500
I understand my students now.
What a lark!

742
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:29,290
While it lasts.

743
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:33,770
Well...

744
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:36,000
What?

745
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:39,170
Goodbye.

746
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:35,170
Boeldieu!

747
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:38,850
De Boeldieu!

748
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:00,900
Listen!

749
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:03,690
I beg you! Come down!

750
01:20:03,310 --> 01:20:06,380
Lieutenants Maréchal and Rosenthal
have escaped.

751
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:16,970
So that's why.

752
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:22,980
Search lights!

753
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:25,930
Send out patrols with dogs!

754
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:29,770
Alert all military
and civil authorities!

755
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:32,930
Report back to me every quarter hour!

756
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:22,370
Your orders have been carried out, sir.

757
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:24,480
No sign of the fugitives yet.

758
01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:06,790
Forgive me.

759
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:11,010
I would have done the same.

760
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:15,590
French or German, duty is duty.

761
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,660
Are you in pain?

762
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:25,190
I didn't think
a bullet in the stomach hurt so much.

763
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:27,780
I aimed at your legs.

764
01:22:29,870 --> 01:22:32,720
It was 500 feet, with poor visibility...

765
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:36,970
Besides, I was running.

766
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:40,580
Please, no excuses.

767
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,850
I was clumsy.

768
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:48,810
I'm not the one to be pitied.

769
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:51,430
For me it will all be over...

770
01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:53,510
soon.

771
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,740
But you'll have to carry on.

772
01:22:59,630 --> 01:23:04,070
Carry on a futile existence.

773
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:10,370
For a commoner,
dying in a war is a tragedy.

774
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:14,950
But for you and me,

775
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:18,050
it's a good way out.

776
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,640
I missed my chance.

777
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:26,350
You shouldn't be talking so much.

778
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:50,470
Sir...

779
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:35,070
We should've avoided the road.
   
780
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,760
We couldn't sleep in the reeds.
   
781
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:40,800
He's gone.
   
782
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:44,510
Didn't you see it was a woman?

783
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:46,710
- Let's get going.
- Wait till dark.

784
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,020
I'm freezing, I have to move.  

785
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:02,780
Want your sugar?

786
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:06,900
There's not much left.

787
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:08,640
And we've a long way to go.
   
788
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:12,900
- What about you?
- I ate mine, I was hungry.
   
789
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:16,240
You keep it, so I won't be tempted.
   
790
01:26:16,410 --> 01:26:19,200
You poor thing...
You ate your buttons, too?

791
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:20,730
Does it show?

792
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,020
So we're not waiting till dark?

793
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:27,450
No, we'll skirt the village first.

794
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,670
Your foot hurt?

795
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,330
It's nothing... a nerve.

796
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:56,220
Let's go.

797
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,390
You coming?

798
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:30,810
You coming or what?

799
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,230
I'm doing the best I can.

800
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,750
You and your foot!

801
01:27:54,910 --> 01:27:56,820
It's not my fault! I slipped.

802
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:59,100
You slipped! That's all I hear.

803
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:02,490
If you get us caught,
you'll explain you slipped?

804
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:05,850
We're out of food.
Might as well give up now.

805
01:28:06,010 --> 01:28:09,150
- Gladly. I've had enough too.
- Had enough of me?

806
01:28:09,310 --> 01:28:12,820
Damn right! If you only knew
how you make me sick!

807
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,890
Well, the feeling's mutual.

808
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:19,260
You're a dead weight,
a ball and chain.

809
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:21,310
I never could stomach Jews!

810
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:25,150
A bit late to realize that!   
Clear out, you're dying too.
   
811
01:28:25,310 --> 01:28:26,810
You said it!

812
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:29,280
Get lost! I'm sick of your ugly mug!

813
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:32,380
I'm going! You're on your own now!
So long!
   
814
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,170
So long! Go ahead!
   
815
01:28:34,330 --> 01:28:36,720
I'm so happy I could sing...
   
816
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:40,640
There once was a little steamboat

817
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:42,770
Which had ne-ne-nevergone to sea

818
01:28:46,110 --> 01:28:48,630
After five or six weeks at sea

819
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:54,330
The supplies
were al-al-almost gone for good...

820
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:13,460
Why'd you come back?

821
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:17,600
Come on.

822
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:26,550
Let's go, fella.

823
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:42,870
- Had enough?
- It's okay. 

824
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:46,140
- Want to rest in that shed there?
- Too risky.

825
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:49,020
- I can't see any smoke.
- Even so...

826
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:52,040
When the ship's on fire,
you go overboard.

827
01:29:52,190 --> 01:29:54,160
Right. Overboard we go!

828
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:55,830
Let's go, old man.

829
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,710
- Someone's there.
- The window! Run for it.

830
01:30:07,870 --> 01:30:09,820
I'll draw them off.

831
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:11,510
Don't move! Keep quiet.

832
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:15,680
Stay where you are!

833
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,700
French...

834
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:39,260
We're not thieves.

835
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:45,820
Prisoners of war?

836
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:49,590
You speak German?

837
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,900
I sprained my foot. We're exhausted.
We're not thieves.

838
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:58,170
I'm not afraid.

839
01:30:58,430 --> 01:31:01,820
Go on, call the police.
I won't walk another step!

840
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:04,340
You sprained your foot?

841
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:13,910
She says to come into the house.

842
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,250
No, I don't trust her.

843
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:23,740
She says she's alone here.   

844
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:11,410
She says her child's asleep, 
so don't make any noise.

845
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:13,850
Come and sit down here.

846
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:20,160
I'll be right back.

847
01:32:51,740 --> 01:32:53,530
Hungry? Yes.

848
01:32:53,790 --> 01:32:56,820
- She asked if you're hungry.
- Yeah, I understood.

849
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,210
What about you?  

850
01:33:13,830 --> 01:33:15,680
I just want to sleep.

851
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:00,700
Excuse me, but how far is Wölfisheim?

852
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:02,010
Eight miles.

853
01:34:03,870 --> 01:34:06,650
I'd sooner stay here
than slog up there!

854
01:34:06,810 --> 01:34:10,640
But duty's duty.
Thanks and good night.

855
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:42,640
Hush! My child's asleep!

856
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:47,130
My husband.

857
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:50,300
Killed at Verdun.

858
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:54,330
My brothers...

859
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:58,100
Killed at Liège...
Charleroi... Tannenberg.

860
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:02,760
Our biggest victories.

861
01:35:07,390 --> 01:35:09,210
The table's too big now.

862
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:19,450
Relax, it's only me!

863
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:25,750
You don't mind
if a Frenchman feeds you.

864
01:35:28,740 --> 01:35:32,560
You smell like my grandfather's cows.
A good smell.

865
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:37,150
You're a cow from Würtemberg 

866
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:40,690
and I'm a working man from Paris,
but we can still be pals!

867
01:35:42,650 --> 01:35:45,140
You're a poor cow,
I'm a poor soldier.

868
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:47,360
We each do our best.

869
01:36:41,660 --> 01:36:44,150
You're a bright little girl. 

870
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,390
Mommy and I know everything. 

871
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:47,990
Really?

872
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:51,990
Then how much milk
does the cow give each month?

873
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:55,130
Mommy knows that.
I know I have ten fingers.

874
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:17,180
She asked for water.

875
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:18,870
I know.

876
01:37:19,770 --> 01:37:24,090
For 18 months, I never understood
the guards. But her I understand.

877
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:42,260
- Nice, but it looks cheap.  
- I did my best.

878
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:45,270
I was talking to Santa Claus.

879
01:37:49,150 --> 01:37:51,220
Joseph's got a nice beard!   

880
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:53,820
Here's the Virgin Mary.

881
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:56,410
Isn't my little donkey cute? 

882
01:37:57,050 --> 01:37:58,590
And my ox?

883
01:37:59,230 --> 01:38:00,640
And the infant Jesus...

884
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,980
An ancestor of mine.

885
01:38:03,390 --> 01:38:05,910
"Touché!"
as poor Boeldieu would say.

886
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:09,280
- Think he's dead?
- Let's not talk about it.

887
01:38:09,690 --> 01:38:13,050
We're ready. Go get the kid. 

888
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:19,360
Hold on...
The gramophone and the candles.

889
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:23,520
Lights out!

890
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:33,300
Lotte! Baby Jesus has come.  

891
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:35,860
I knew he would!

892
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:49,010
Is it for me?

893
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,340
I want little Jesus.

894
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:54,240
To take to bed?

895
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:56,790
No, to eat.

896
01:38:57,830 --> 01:38:59,900
He's not for eating.

897
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:02,270
She wants to eat Baby Jesus! 

898
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:07,730
Strictly forbidden, my sweet!

899
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:11,030
Then I'll eat Joseph.

900
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:13,820
All right, but in bed.

901
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,560
She wants Joseph? There you go.

902
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:25,500
You're a good little girl.   

903
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:32,020
Your gramophone's on the blink.

904
01:39:34,650 --> 01:39:36,890
How do you say:
"Lotte has blue eyes"?

905
01:39:57,700 --> 01:39:59,250
Go to sleep, pumpkin.

906
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:23,060
I don't know how to thank you.

907
01:40:23,230 --> 01:40:24,820
Thank us?

908
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:27,190
We owe you so much.

909
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:30,970
Well... good night.

910
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:16,150
I'll make some coffee.

911
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,630
The coffee's ready.

912
01:42:18,470 --> 01:42:19,510
Say it in French.

913
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:32,250
Have you told her we're leaving?

914
01:42:34,650 --> 01:42:35,700
Not yet.

915
01:42:35,870 --> 01:42:37,150
It's high time.

916
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:41,150
You tell her.

917
01:42:48,570 --> 01:42:51,360
- We must be going.
- I knew it.

918
01:42:51,510 --> 01:42:55,990
Maréchal couldn't bear to tell you.

919
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:58,010
Why?

920
01:42:58,660 --> 01:43:00,890
I always knew he'd have to go.

921
01:43:09,470 --> 01:43:10,690
Come on in.

922
01:43:11,710 --> 01:43:13,240
There's hot coffee.

923
01:43:33,430 --> 01:43:36,120
You should eat something
before you go.

924
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,760
Do we wait until dark?

925
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,230
Sure.

926
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:01,850
Let's say good-bye to the cow.

927
01:44:04,890 --> 01:44:07,190
I've been alone too long.

928
01:44:08,770 --> 01:44:10,650
I've waited so long.

929
01:44:13,090 --> 01:44:15,640
If you knew how happy I've been

930
01:44:17,470 --> 01:44:21,150
to hear your footsteps
around the house.

931
01:44:28,610 --> 01:44:30,500
Elsa... Listen.

932
01:44:33,950 --> 01:44:35,950
When war over...

933
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:39,170
if me not dead...

934
01:44:39,390 --> 01:44:40,980
Understand?

935
01:44:41,950 --> 01:44:45,630
I... come back here... no?   

936
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:50,070
And you... after... come...  

937
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:53,250
with me... to France.

938
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,010
With Lotte... no?

939
01:44:58,970 --> 01:45:01,240
For the journey.

940
01:45:09,380 --> 01:45:11,540
Go quickly. It's better that way.

941
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:54,720
- Not looking back?
- If I do, I might never leave.

942
01:46:28,670 --> 01:46:31,360
- Let's move.
- We're not waiting till dark?

943
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:33,210
We'd lose our way.

944
01:46:33,530 --> 01:46:37,790
The woods will hide us. But in
the valley, we'll have to stay low.

945
01:46:38,010 --> 01:46:40,080
You're sure that's Switzerland?

946
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:42,670
- Positive.
- It all looks the same.

947
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:46,360
You can't see borders.
They're man-made.

948
01:46:46,820 --> 01:46:48,600
Nature couldn't care less.   

949
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:51,320
I want to see an end to all this.

950
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:53,300
Then I'd go back for Elsa.   

951
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:55,200
- You love her?
- I think so.  

952
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,360
Even if we do make it,

953
01:46:57,540 --> 01:47:01,910
you'll go back to flying
and me to gunning, we'll keep fighting.

954
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:05,370
Like the fellas.
We've got to end this damn war...

955
01:47:05,540 --> 01:47:07,160
and make it the last.

956
01:47:07,330 --> 01:47:08,830
Don't delude yourself.

957
01:47:08,990 --> 01:47:12,400
Let's come down to earth.
What if we run into a patrol?

958
01:47:12,580 --> 01:47:15,290
We split up, and try our luck.

959
01:47:15,450 --> 01:47:19,000
just in case, let's say goodbye
and see you soon.

960
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:23,040
- So long, you dirty Jew.
- So long, you old dog.  

961
01:48:01,530 --> 01:48:03,810
Don't shoot!
They're in Switzerland.

962
01:52:41,060 --> 01:52:42,720
Good for them!
