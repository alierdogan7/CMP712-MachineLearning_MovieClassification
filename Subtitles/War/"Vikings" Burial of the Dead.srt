Svein: What is it?
(Floki giggles)

36
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:43,852
Housecarl 1: My lord, this man
says he has a message for you

37
00:01:43,953 --> 00:01:46,422
from Ragnar Lothbrok.

38
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,923
Let him go!

39
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:52,928
What's the message?

40
00:01:53,997 --> 00:01:59,401
Ragnar Lothbrok challenges you
to meet him in single combat.

41
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:09,111
Ragnar Lothbrok has a very
high opinion of himself.

42
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,780
Well, he is a descendant
of Odin.

43
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,882
(Everyone laughs)

44
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:16,452
(Laughter stops)

45
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:20,789
Ragnar said that
if you refuse his challenge,

46
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,493
then shame would follow you
the rest of your life.

47
00:02:24,594 --> 00:02:25,861
There would be greater shame

48
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:29,498
in accepting a challenge
from a criminal.

49
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,266
That would suggest
that I take him seriously;

50
00:02:31,368 --> 00:02:33,369
That I see him as an equal.

51
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:37,206
The challenge is declined.

52
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:39,241
<i>When Ragnar Lothbrok appears</i>
<i>in Kattegat,</i>

53
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:41,910
<i>he will be put in chains.</i>

54
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:45,347
<i>The seer: Stones and bones.</i>

55
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:48,117
He searches for your death.

56
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:50,219
Does he desire to be Earl?

57
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,024
If he kills you,
would it not be so?

58
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:06,835
Tell Ragnar Lothbrok
I accept his challenge.

59
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,604
<i>Take him away.</i>

63

- Ragnar...
- What?

64
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,334
Let's go away.

65
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:41,870
Let's leave here.

66
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:45,441
This is not the only place
for us.

67
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:47,910
Ragnar: He is old.

68
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:51,980
What are you frightened of?

69
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:54,917
You can't fight.

70
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:57,653
You're still too weak.

71
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:02,858
Perhaps that makes us equal.

72
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:10,299
Never fight unless you know
the odds are in your favor.

73
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,335
That is our way.

74
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:17,639
Ragnar: Who sets the odds?

75
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:27,483
Our fates are already decided.

76
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:32,654
(Breathing heavily)

77
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:38,060
Lagertha: You don't believe
that and neither do I.

78
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:42,898
Ragnar: You are wrong:

79
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:47,503
I do believe it.

80
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:57,346
<i>(Howling in the distance)</i>

81
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,220
Siggy: (Quietly) Come to bed.

82
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:07,022
You need to rest, to sleep.

83
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:09,458
Earl Haraldson: Yes, I will.

84
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:14,129
There's always time to sleep.

85
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:19,067
I was thinking about our boys,

86
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:22,170
what they would look like now.

87
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:27,910
Don't...
Don't think about them.

88
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:30,012
Think about tomorrow.

89
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,115
When I must kill a man

90
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:36,618
for whom I have
the utmost respect.

91
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:41,223
<i>Siggy: Respect?</i>

92
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:45,360
You respect Ragnar Lothbrok?

93
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:47,162
Why not?

94
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,264
He is what I used to be...

95
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:51,033
restless, ambitious.

96
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:57,472
And he was right about
the Western lands.

97
00:05:57,574 --> 00:06:00,442
But I always knew that
in my heart.

98
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:07,115
<i>Siggy: Then why
didn't you tell him?</i>

99
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:08,850
Because the moment
that I reached out

100
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:09,851
to Ragnar Lothbrok,

101
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,187
was the moment
that all my friends,

102
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,222
all my supporters
would have deserted me

103
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:15,824
and joined him.

104
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,428
It was impossible to do it.

105
00:06:21,497 --> 00:06:22,464
But it's true,

106
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:25,500
our fates have
brought us together.

107
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,106
And maybe he's opened
the Western lands for me.

108
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:39,548
That is my hope,
after I kill him.

109
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:46,388
The seer promised
you would kill him?

110
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,624
Yes.

111
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,893
Good.

112
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:03,205
(Earl Bjarni shouts out
in pleasure)

113
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:09,144
Earl Bjarni: I'm sure
that's our first child.

114
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:10,379
(Panting)

115
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,980
Now get up and fetch me
some pickled herrings.

116
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:14,016
I'm starving.

117
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:16,385
I don't like the smell of them
in the bed.

118
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:17,786
Your clothes are smelly enough
as it is.

119
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:20,122
Why can't you just wash
like everyone else?

120
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:22,090
I thought a wife wasn't supposed
to nag her husband

121
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,860
until they'd had time
to grow tired of each other?

122
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:27,429
If you don't get up
and fetch me some herrings

123
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,830
I will beat you.

124
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:31,166
Perhaps that will make you
show a little life

125
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,834
when we have sex, in any case!

126
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:34,403
Thyri: Very well.

127
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:35,804
I'll go.

128

<i>Earl Bjarni:</i>
<i>I can't wait till tomorrow.</i>

129
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:40,942
Personal combat
is always thrilling.

130
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,911
Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok?

131
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:45,414
I've heard many people
talk about him.

132
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:47,849
<i>Thyri I don't talk about him.</i>

133
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,885
