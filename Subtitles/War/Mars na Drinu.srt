The battle took place on
the mountain of Cer,

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,640

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,560
Starring in order of appearance

00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,080
"The March to the Drina"
Composed in 1914

8
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,600
by Stanislav Binicki.

9
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,120
After the wars with Turkey
in 1912 and Bulgaria in 1913,

10
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,120
an exhausted Serbia was
at the verge of another war.

11
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,760
Belgrade
July 26, 1914.

12
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,600
MOBILISATION

13
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,120
TO THE SERBIAN PEOPLE

14
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,360
Hey kid, bring me a paper.

15
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,440
Veca!

16
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,160
Close the door, Veca.

17
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,280
It's war, son.

18
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,440
Where are you assigned to?

19
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,680
It's the same battery,
but in a combined division.

20
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,840
I've just spoken
to Mr Rajkovic.

21
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,960
Here is your coffee.

22
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,240
Does he need another supplier
and delegate from France.

23
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,160
Send my regards to him.
I'm not going anywhere.

24
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,680
Our hero wants
to go to war again.

25
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,880
There are whispers that many
are leaving by commission.

26
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,680
There are many who want to
leave, and I'm afraid they will.

27
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,720
Good luck to them,
Uncle Laza.

28
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,080
I went last time. Now
it's someone else's turn.

29
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,280
It wasn't bad over there.

30
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,080
Would you feel better lying
in mud, hungry and thirsty?

31
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,560
It was great! That commission
makes me sick to this day!

32
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,360
So many of my friends died,
while I... -Veca, my son.

33
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,720
I'm not leaving! I'm joining
the battery and that's that!

34
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,000
Veca, I know what duty means,

35
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,640
but you were five times more
useful in the commission.

36
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,720
Anyone can stand
behind a gun,

37
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,280
but those guns
have to be purchased.

38
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,800
You were ten times more
useful. -Thank you, Uncle.

39
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,800
I wasn't any use to the Serbs,
to myself or to this bank.

40
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,280
Even in this office,
all I am is a pen pusher.

41
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,880
Milena, have a safe trip and
send my regards to Uncle Uros.

42
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,280
Thank you, Veca.

43
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,240
Hi, Veca. Son, here are some
balloons and some water.

44
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,760
Don't give him any now.
He's just eaten some pears.

45
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,720
Kosta, take care of yourself.
-I will. Send my regards.

46
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,000
Tell father to look
after you and the child.

47
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,440
Don't forget to write.

48
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,360
I will. Good-bye and
have a safe journey.

49
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,400
Come here, son.

50
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,040
Brother Kole, they're leaving!

51
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,240
Trivun is waiting for you.
-I know. I'll be there.

52
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,080
Do you know why?
-I can't think about that now.

53
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,720
Where are you going now?
-To headquarters, of course.

54
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,760
I need to talk to you.
-Oh, no. Let's go! Tonight.

55
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,000
Brother Kole!

56
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,240
Gentlemen and Friends!
-Brother Kole!

57
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,680
I'm much better addressing guns,
but I will tell you this.

58
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:19,360
We have to go because
they want to trample on us!

59
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,560
Who knows when we'll be
able to get together again.

60
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,840
So, let's drink and make
this a night to remember.

61
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,640
What is it, you snots?
It's "hooray" in the café,

62
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,760
but when you're standing in
your ranks, you'll be cursing!

63
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,280
Get back!

64
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,280
A drink for Kursula!

65
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,600
Get back, now! When you put
on your tunic, get back to me.

66
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,200
Today, I'm not
talking to civilians!

67
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,560
I'm only drinking with
Serbian soldiers. -Kursula!

68
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,080
Brother Kole!

69
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,240
How are you, my beauties?

70
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,000
Brother Kole, I've been looking
everywhere for you!

71
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,320
Hello, Badza! Join us.
When are you leaving?

72
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,120
I should be on my way,
but I need to dampen my throat.

73
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,200
I've been running around the
last three days and nights.

74
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,480
Where have you been
the Last few days?

75
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,800
Business. So much, that my
head hurts. -It can happen.

76
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,920
Gentlemen, this captain used
to turn this town inside out!

77
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,120
He'd chase the gendarme and
whores would jump out of windows!

78
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,760
Now he's washing nappies!

79
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,800
Perfume for the wife
and money in the bank!

80
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,520
I heard that the Major
is getting married?

81
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,880
I was going to, honestly.

82
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,200
It's just that Serbia can't have
two years of peace in a row.

83
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,360
Or I just don't know how to,
not Like our Captain here.

84
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,480
That's correct, Major!
He's my cousin,

85
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,240
more Like a brother. He used
to be my hero! Like a God!

86
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,040
And tell us brother,
who are you?

87
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,080
I told you, that's Veca.

88
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,400
Artillery Lieutenant,
Velimir Hadzi-Vukovic.

89
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,320
Where's your uniform, brother?
Why are you still a civilian?

90
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,960
I'm Leaving tomorrow with the
combined division. Aren't I?

91
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,120
Stop conspiring with Trivun!
Am I staying in the battery?

92
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:24,960
It's not my decision to make.
We know who decides. Sit down.

93
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,160
Honestly, what do you think...
-Sit down and keep still!

94
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,840
Veca, brother Kole! I've
finally caught up with you.

95
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,400
Good evening, Uncle Laza.
-Kid, tonight you're buying.

96
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,600
Trivun's arranged everything.
-What has he arranged?

97
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,720
All you have to do is report
to Colonel Lukic tomorrow.

98
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,360
Who's this Colonel Lukic?
Tell me the truth!

99
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,920
He's a great man! You'll find
it easy under his command.

100
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,560
Zdravko M. Lukic.
Commissions and the like.

101
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,840
Parlez, parlez, s'il vous plait!
You've got it Lucky, brother!

102
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,600
You can all forget it!
You, the Colonel and Trivun!

103
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,240
Last time he tricked me from
joining the army. Not again!

104
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,480
Well talk tomorrow.
-Stop! Wait!

105
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,160
I'm busy, Veca.
Good night, gentlemen.

106
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,960
I don't give a damn about
your business! Stop!

107
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,640
I haven't been home since this
morning. My wife will hang me.

108
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,200
First I want you to Listen
to what I have to say!

109
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,520
Leave me alone, child!
-Uncle Laza, stop, wait!

110
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,160
Everyone's staring at us! God
help me, you've gone crazy!

111
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,880
Oh, Serbia, Mother dear...

112
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,040
Arandjelovac
August 10, 1914

113
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:04,280
At ease! Today's exercise is
over. Make sure you rest well.

114
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,240
When a man falls out of
a tree, he must also rest.

115
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,880
Make sure that your conduct
is that becoming of a soldier.

116
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,520
You, boy! Two paces forward!
-Who? Me?

117
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,000
Who do you think?
My father?

118
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,440
You called my "Sergeant"?
-I sure did, Sergeant!

119
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,200
If someone
calls me Sergeant,

120
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,520
it's because we've been
through two wars together!

121
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,440
You are to address me as
"Sergeant, Sir"! Understood?

122
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,920
Understood, Sergeant, Sir!
-Dismissed!

123
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,680
I told you to be careful.
You didn't join yesterday!

124
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,520
In a battery, the Sergeant is
a god. Don't ever forget that!

125
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,360
Otherwise youll be scratching
where it doesn't itch!

126
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,280
They really Look alike,
just like grenades.

127
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,120
The first quads in Serbia.
They were in the newspaper.

128
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,480
Congratulations, Sergeant,
and may they live Long.

129
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,960
I've already congratulated
him. He's a Lucky man.

130
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,000
Some have to slave four times,
but he only had to once.

131
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,080
I'm surprised to see you here.
I thought you quit the army.

132
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,760
I wanted to, but I couldn't
get used to civilian clothing.

133
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:49,120
I Like it when everyone knows
his duty. -Correct, Sergeant!

134
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,440
The sacred rule
of the army is,

135
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,280
if you take care of your own
business, there's no reproach.

136
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,680
The Lieutenant is singing.
-Let him.

137
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,960
As Long as he's with us,
we'll be safe.

138
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,360
Last time they sent him away,
we fought a terrible battle!

139
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,440
I won't have such talk! They
were his orders. Understood?

140
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:20,280
Understood, Sir! I just wonder
why we never get such orders.

141
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,680
Keep wondering, but I don't
want to hear such talk!

142
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,440
He's a Lieutenant
and that's that!

143
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,280
Correct, Sir, strictly
according to regulations.

144
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,320
You Listen or I'll
shut your mouth!

145
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,960
Professor!

146
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,160
Are you getting used to the
battery? -Ill be fine.

147
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,440
It's easier in the army,
than dealing with my family.

148
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,800
My family, even brother Kole,
wanted to send me away again.

149
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,440
You won't find it that easy.
I was about to tell you.

150
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,440
They remember,
and so they should.

151
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,599
I'd feel the same towards
anyone who ran from the army.

152
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,040
Ill have plenty of
time to show them.

153
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,040
Come on men, down to business.
Let's fill up these seats!

154
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,600
Sergeant, would you
Like some tobacco?

155
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,640
All you do is waste your time
gambling! -Stop wining!

156
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,760
Tomorrow we'll be
gambling with our Lives!

157
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,840
The Commander isn't even here.
He's gone to headquarters.

158
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,720
I pay in cash. Just like the
Lieutenant's father, Trivun.

159
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,120
I made a joke about him
and got into trouble.

160
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,080
And so you should,
you behave Like a beast!

161
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,080
Wash your feet or I'll choke
before I get near the Krauts!

162
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,680
Let's see...
You're lucky this time.

163
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,960
I'm fit and well. -Leave
that letter and join us!

164
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,760
The first litter is
thrown into water,

165
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,960
and the first letter
is not sent home.

166
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,160
Exactly! They cry for days,
when they get their first Letter.

167
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,160
Come on Alexa,
stop being stingy!

168
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,640
Hey, you rogue, don't you know
that gambling is forbidden?

169
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,520
I know. Join us.
-Did you ask for permission?

170
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,800
I did. -Whose?
-My backside's. -What?!

171
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,960
I asked if it could
withstand 25 lashes.

172
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,160
It said it could. Join us.

173
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,360
Watch out! He doesn't seem
to Like your wise remarks.

174
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,480
Open it, Major.

175
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,480
The 5th and 6th enemy armies
are heading towards the Drina.

176
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,000
The 5th has crossed the river.
Our 3th is under pressure.

177
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,720
One might think this is the
enemie's main attack plan.

178
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,000
Logically, it's not, because
of the difficult terrain.

179
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:38,680
The enemie's 2nd army,
Located in Srem and Banat,

180
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,920
is bombing Belgrade
and Obrenovac.

181
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,360
It's preparing to attack
Sabac. This is also a fact.

182
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,640
I was in Arandjelovac today.
It's the first time I Liked it.

183
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,640
Gorgeous women! Many
who escaped from Belgrade.

184
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,480
There are whores, as well.
-Anything to say, Kursula?

185
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,640
Nothing, Sir. Private remarks.
-Let us hear them.

186
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,160
I bet that the attacks on the
Sava and Danube are tricks.

187
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,640
The main attack will be at the
Drina. -You find that logical?

188
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,200
If there's only one army
attacking from the north,

189
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,360
and two on the Drina, then
that'll be the main attack.

190
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:38,120
Well see. Gentlemen,
we have orders to move.

191
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,520
The division is to gather
At Ub, monitor situations,

192
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,840
and react accordingly.

193
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,640
Our regiment will
head the division,

194
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,360
along with the artillery
division. That will be all.

195
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,400
Return to your units
and prepare to move.

196
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,480
Youll have more
details in an hour.

197
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,000
Captain, a moment, please.
-I'll wait for you.

198
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,760
This march could pose special
tasks for your battery. -Yes, Sir!

199
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,720
Are you satisfied with
the state of your battery?

200
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,080
In general. -We could
replace your Lieutenant.

201
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,440
Hadzi-Vukovic is my relative
and was in my battery before.

202
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,320
He's the only son
of a noted family.

203
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,280
They still want to persuade
him. -To Leave the army?

204
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,240
Yes. I'm in a difficult
position. He's close to me.

205
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,000
Let's just Leave it for now.
-Well, you're the Commander.

206
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,800
Where are you going now?
Do you have time for a drink?

207
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,680
I'd love to. What's all that
nonsense about the Drina?

208
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,560
You failed your exams because
of that. -Listen, brother.

209
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,000
Austria's main attack will be
across the Drina, not the Sava.

210
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,680
It's not suitable for an attack.
-That's what they say.

211
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,240
General Stepa repeatedly
told me. "It's not Logical.

212
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,080
The best strategic attack is
across the Sava and Danube."

213
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,760
I said: "The Austrians know
we'll be waiting on the Sava,

214
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,880
and that's why theyll
attack from the Drina."

215
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,800
Well be waiting in the hills
and beat them to a pulp!

216
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,560
Let's make a bet! I say the main
attack will come from the Drina!

217
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,720
Rista!
-Yes, Sir!

218
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,720
Get me Second Lieutenant
Stojanovic! -Yes, Sir.

219
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,080
What time is it?
-After midnight. 12.20.

220
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,160
Try to sleep in the saddle.
Youll need it.

221
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,160
Don't worry about me.
I can handle anything.

222
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,640
Sir, the Commander
is asking for you.

223
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,960
I should have told him
to ask where we're going.

224
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:48,800
It's against regulations. I hope
we pass through Sabac.

225
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,840
I want to help them, because
the Krauts are bombing them.

226
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,720
I don't care,
even if we go to Vienna.

227
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,760
They say the bridge
is weak here.

228
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,440
Take two men and check it.

229
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,560
If the bridge is incapable,
find a ford. Be back by dawn.

230
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:11,920
All right, Kosta.
Rista! Milan! Follow me!

231
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:23,040
Brother Kole, I should have gone.
I'm the Lieutenant.

232
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,760
Miloje will do it better.
It's dark.

233
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,480
It's dark, but there's
a map. I can read it.

234
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,200
Forget about it. Take out
that bottle of cognac.

235
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,960
Do you want some
tobacco, Sergeant? -No.

236
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,240
What are you staring at?
Are you posing for me?

237
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,680
You're worried. Something's
eating at you. -I agree.

238
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,040
You're worrying a lot
about something, Sergeant.

239
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,960
I'm worrying where youll
sleep and what youll eat.

240
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,480
Who's going to worry
about my family?

241
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,840
Your wife will, Sergeant.
Is she pretty?

242
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,720
That's none of your business.

243
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,920
If she's pretty, someone
will always take care of her.

244
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,000
Other men's wives are the
best! -The sweetest!

245
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,680
Stop this indecent talk
in front of this child.

246
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,480
This here child is married.
Since when? -The other day.

247
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,680
What other day? -One day
before I was mobilised.

248
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,320
They interrupted you
in the middle of it!

249
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,440
Why did you get married now?
Did you manage to do anything?

250
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,560
Where Little brother, how?
-In the dark.

251
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,960
You haven't even seen all of
her. Did you undress her?

252
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,320
We peasants are shy.
We don't undress.

253
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,680
She won't be shy when you get
back. Experts will teach her.

254
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:04,280
That's war. She can be pure as
snow, but when her time comes!

255
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,440
Stop it, you mongrel! The
Likes of you should be shot!

256
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,280
Sergeant! -How dare you talk
Like that about decent women?!

257
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,440
You're a thief and fraud who
doesn't have a pot to piss in!

258
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,320
My wife is the daughter
of a priest. You bastard!

259
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,840
Wait, Sergeant!
-Not another word!

260
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,040
They're housewives and mothers!
I swear I'll kill you!

261
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,560
Stop! Stop the gun! Corporal!

262
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,080
A man has fallen!
-What happened?

263
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,160
Corporal!

264
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,640
Help me men! Help!

265
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,600
It's the gambler!

266
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,720
Turn his head up!

267
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,880
Aleksa, give him some water!
-What? -Get out the flask!

268
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,240
Hold his head up!
-Come on!

269
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,600
What's wrong?
-Hit him on the back.

270
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,440
You're beating the Life
out of me! Stop it!

271
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:25,560
Look, you dropped your cards!
The tools of your trade.

272
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,680
What happened?
-Nothing, Sir,

273
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,520
the time adjuster fell of the
gun. He's fine. -Very well.

274
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,240
Ill go and see.
-Go on.

275
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,600
Look at all this money!
You could build a church!

276
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:53,240
Photos as well! A girl!
Maybe it's his relative.

277
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:59,080
He can't have any relatives.
Who did you steal them from?

278
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,600
Don't touch! Give them back,
you thieves!

279
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,680
I wouldn't let God himself
touch them! Back off!

280
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,720
You're crazy! We weren't
going to eat them!

281
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,080
You crazy gambler!
Come on, Aleksa!

282
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,400
Take your tools!

283
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:29,960
You've disrupted the entire
battery, you good-for nothing!

284
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:36,640
Who told you to dismount?
-We need to relieve ourselves!

285
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,600
They wouldn't dare piss
on state saddles! Aleksa!

286
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,000
Mount!

287
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,680
Lieutenant, Sir,
you wouldn't believe it!

288
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,360
Trajko, the cook, was telling
Bogi his future. He said:

289
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,760
"You're going to fall
from a height." And he did.

290
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,640
Corporal, enough
of this superstition!

291
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,880
Yes, Sir, but he did fall!
-That's enough!

292
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,760
Sergeant, can we go on?
-Ready, Sir!

293
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:31,360
Lazarevac
August 14, 1914

294
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,280
Hey, Trajko! -Here I am,
Corporal Janicije!

295
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,560
Trajko! -I'm here!

296
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,040
Old man, can you do something
for me? Ill pay you.

297
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:57,720
For you, dear? Who's going to
help me with these beans?

298
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,080
Forget the beans! Please,
Look at your cards!

299
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,000
I was so scared last night!
I heard an owl, twice!

300
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:11,440
An owl? -I asked, but
no one heard it, except me.

301
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,880
Listen, dear, it's not a good
sign, but you never know.

302
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,200
Come back Later. -Something
bad is going to happen?

303
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,280
You're going to war, dear.
It can only be bad, not good.

304
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:36,160
Please, can you Look now?
-Ail right. -Take out the cards.

305
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:44,600
Look. Maybe I can escape my
misfortune. -We'll see.

306
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,920
Cut.
-What? -Cut.

307
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,520
What is it?

308
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,560
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

309
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:29,280
Home, happiness, wife.

310
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,480
>Ub
August 14, 1914

311
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:15,440
Sir, do you mind if the men
get out of the pouring rain?

312
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,960
So they should, Corporal.

313
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,800
Men, who would like a smoke?
-You shouldn't. -Oh, don't.

314
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,640
Go on, who knows how
Long we'll have to wait.

315
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,520
Thank you, Sir. This one
could Last me a Long time.

316
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,040
Take one! Stop being shy as a
bride. -I don't smoke, Sir.

317
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,520
No one in my family does. Only
my youngest brother, Proka.

318
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,400
He's just become a corporal.

319
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,960
How many brothers do you have?
-I had a lot of brothers,

320
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,760
but they were killed
in the Last two wars.

321
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,560
Now, there's only Proka and
myself. He's still so young.

322
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:03,560
I'm always thinking of him.
He's a teacher, now a corporal.

323
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,600
Boys, you'd be happy about
this rain, if you were home.

324
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:17,560
Just when the summer sun
is about to burn everything,

325
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:28,400
it rains, just like this. I
say to Proka: "It's raining."

326
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:36,360
I go and stand in the rain.
It's as if God is crying.

327
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,320
Even though I'm wet, I still
can't believe it's raining.

328
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:49,440
When I reach the wet plums,
then I know it's raining.

329
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,800
Damn this war! But we have to,
because they attacked us.

330
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,760
That's right, Sir, we
have to defend ourselves.

331
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:07,280
When you came, did you
notice us Laughing? -No, why?

332
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:13,440
We were observing the gambler
making passes at that lady.

333
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,400
He's skilful. Do you
think hell do it?

334
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,320
He could, if we
stayed Long enough.

335
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,560
Dear Lady, I forgot to ask
you the most important thing.

336
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,680
Where's your husband?
-In the army, on the Drina.

337
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,960
That's no good. We're in the
same boat: we're both alone.

338
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,760
What can we do? It's God will.
-You're absolutely right.

339
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:48,040
We could help each other,
you know. Times are like that.

340
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:55,240
Stop that. Aren't you a jolly
fellow? I might report you.

341
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:02,040
Ill knock his teeth out!
-Can't you see he's all talk?

342
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,520
She's Serbian. Maybe her
husband's a soldier, like you.

343
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,800
Petrovic! -Who, me?
-No, my father! Come here!

344
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,120
Can't you see that the
bar is loose? Fix it!

345
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,520
It's on the first gun.
That's not my job.

346
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,480
Don't smart-mouth me!
Move it!

347
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,440
I don't even know
what time of day it is!

348
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,120
Good evening, Sir.
-Hello, Brother Kole. -Hello.

349
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,960
Gentlemen, the situation has
changed since yesterday.

350
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,640
Headquarters now believes
that the enemy won't attack...

351
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,960
from the north across the
Sava and Danube rivers.

352
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,000
It seems that the main attack
will come from the Drina...

353
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,080
with the enemy's
5th and 6th armies.

354
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,000
It seems that Mr Kursula's
assumptions were correct.

355
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,880
Congratulations, Major!
-Thank you, Sir!

356
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:18,280
Tomorrow your units must be in
the village of Veliki Bosnjak.

357
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,400
Here are your orders
in more detail.

358
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,520
What's the situation
in the battery?

359
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,000
The men are tired, Sir. They
haven't slept since yesterday.

360
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,440
That I know! What about
their morale? -Good, Sir!

361
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,080
It's very important it stays
that way. -Understood, Sir!

362
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,480
Goodbye, gentlemen.

363
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,320
Let's see where they're
sending us, brother.

364
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,960
... She washed her feet,
then fell into the river...

365
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,840
Did you hear the old man's
voice tremble when he said:

366
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,560
"You were right, Kursula."

367
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,560
He would have given anything
not to have to admit it.

368
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,160
If I could see General Stepa,
I'd ask him now:

369
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,720
"Why didn't I pass the exam?'

370
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,800
We're going west,
towards the Drina.

371
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,840
Infantry, let the battery pass!
Move aside! Now!

372
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,120
Keep going, you gunners!

373
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,720
Make sure you don't tire
from all that sitting!

374
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,120
Youll be kissing this gun,
the minute it gets rough!

375
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,920
Really? We're scared we'll
Lose the war without you!

376
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,840
Shut up, you arse!
-Your wife's an arse!

377
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,880
Dusty arses!
-Horse shit!

378
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,520
You had a nap.

379
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,400
Good for you. Who knows
what's waiting for us.

380
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,640
My watch stopped.
What time is it? -Nearly seven.

381
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,360
I keep thinking of Sabac.
Why did we give it up so fast?

382
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:31,840
What's the exact time?
-Five to seven.

383
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,120
It's best that the men
don't know about Sabac.

384
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,800
Give me that flask!

385
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:58,480
Captain, Sir! -Yes! -I have a
favour to ask. I don't know...

386
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,000
Come on Sergeant, we've known
each other for a Long time.

387
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,720
Why are you hesitating?
-This isn't official.

388
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,000
Go on. -I don't know where to
begin. It's a personal matter.

389
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,040
Sir, my wife and children
are all alone in Sabac.

390
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,000
Could I pop over to Sabac and
take my family to safety?

391
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:31,480
Pop over? -You have my word
Ill return. No one would know.

392
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,520
If it were up to me, I'd Let
you go. But we have orders.

393
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:50,160
I know, Sir. -Maybe your family
has managed without you.

394
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,240
They're not alone in Sabac.
There's plenty of people.

395
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,880
My wife's not resourceful.
She's confused and scared.

396
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,880
And my four children are just
Like her. Their faces naïve.

397
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:10,880
Their eyes are so blue,
just like the English.

398
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,640
Sorry, Sir. Excuse me.

399
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,440
Sergeant!

400
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,840
Sabac has fallen.
-How, Sir?

401
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,880
It's fallen.
The Austrians are there.

402
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,680
What about the civilians?

403
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,160
It's war, Sergeant.
You know as much as I do.

404
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,400
Battery, halt!

405
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,960
Are you tired?

406
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,960
Ceda!

407
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,720
It's thundering.
Looks like rain again.

408
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,400
Corporal, the rain seems to be
following us. Hear the thunder?

409
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,080
I hear it, Sir!

410
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,680
What are you staring at?

411
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,880
Shall we stretch our legs?
-Why not.

412
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,920
Tell the younger officers not
to wander off. -Yes, Sir!

413
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:19,960
Sergeant! The battery need not
know about Sabac. -Understood.

414
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,560
Any news? -Plenty.
Belgrade is evacuated.

415
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,520
The fighting in Sabac is worse.
Our troops want to get it back.

416
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,640
Where we're going, Well be
knee-high in blood! -Where?

417
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,920
Listen! It's top secret,
so keep your mouth shut!

418
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:45,600
You know the mountain Cer?
The Austrians are nearly there.

419
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,800
That's where we're going.
General Stepa is somewhere there.

420
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,160
Sergeant, I want to tell you
something. -What did you say?

421
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,120
I wanted to say, don't be angry.
-lf it's official, say it!

422
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,560
It's not official.
I didn't mean to offend.

423
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,840
I won't talk to you in private.
Not with a ruffian!

424
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,360
It keeps thundering,
but there are no clouds.

425
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,400
What are you talking about?
It's the artillery. -What?!

426
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,040
Fierce fighting somewhere.
At least five or six batteries.

427
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,680
Don't worry, they're already
asleep. -What an ass!

428
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,000
Any artillery man would know.

429
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,640
Corporal Janicije's
thinking now:

430
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,080
"Because you ran Last year, you
can't tell a gun from thunder."

431
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:17,800
Nonsense. Who says? You
didn't run, you were transferred.

432
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,480
Excuse me, have you seen
the Drina Division?

433
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,920
I've heard that they're in
Krupanj. God only knows!

434
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,400
I have a brother
in the 5th Battalion.

435
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,840
His name is Proka,
Prokopije Pantic.

436
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,800
Who knows, my child. They
say there were big battles.

437
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:50,080
He doesn't know where he is,
Let alone your brother!

438
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,040
I had to ask. I'm worried!
-You peasants always worry!

439
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,960
You always have to whine!
Why did you have to join?

440
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:03,680
How could I not join?! Who
would go to war, if not us?

441
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,840
You're an old nag
of a corporal!

442
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,400
Come on, keep it moving!
The army has to get through!

443
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,840
Look where you're going, auntie!
-Poor me, where am I going?

444
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,760
Throw away what you can't carry!
Just keep it moving!

445
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,360
Sergeant, are you with these
people? -As you can see.

446
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,320
Is anyone from Sabac?
-I don't know. Ask further down.

447
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,800
Sergeant!

448
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,240
Listen, I want to
tell you something!

449
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,760
I didn't come to insult you,
so help me God! I'm a man, too!

450
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:47,360
You, a man? You good-for-nothing!
You don't know what a man is!

451
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,160
I didn't want to insult you!

452
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,000
The village, Veliki Bosnjak
August 15, 1914

453
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:30,240
Brother Kole! We let you pass,
and still we arrived before you.

454
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:35,400
You can't beat the infantry!
-Where can I put my battery?

455
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,320
By the city hall. Get there
before the Morova lot do.

456
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,520
Don't you worry!

457
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:51,480
Your exploiting the situation!
-Not me! -Yes, you!

458
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:58,840
I would have given 80, but 1 20!
I should hang you from this tree!

459
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:03,480
I paid a fair price for them!
If you don't take them,

460
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:10,280
Ill return them to the café,.
Zivko, come and take them back!

461
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,560
Stop yelling! Youll start
a riot, because of this beer!

462
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:21,200
80! -Zivko!
90! -Zivko, get over here!

463
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:33,000
Men, didn't you see the beer?
-Yes, Sir! I started to drool!

464
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,360
Well, get some strong lads.
Hurry up!

465
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,960
Aleksa, Rosy, Bogi, follow me!

466
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,600
The boy's doing fine.
-Thank God!

467
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,280
I thought the battery
wouldn't accept him.

468
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:11,240
They'll accept him,
sooner than you will.

469
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:18,440
Why? I haven't accepted him?
What do you mean by that?

470
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:23,120
Brother Kole,
because you're relatives,

471
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,200
I don't want to interfere.
-Go on, say it.

472
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:32,680
I don't know him well, but
he needs to feel like a man.

473
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,280
What am l, a nanny?
-No, but still...

474
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,840
What's he doing here?

475
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:15,200
Move over, so I can see!
Now the fun begins.

476
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,480
Aleksa, was it Like this Last
time? -When, what?

477
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:26,400
Stop pretending! Is this
what happened last year?

478
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,240
I won't discuss it any more,
Veca! That's enough!

479
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:37,000
Damn the battery!
-Go back from where you came!

480
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:43,360
Is that how you talk to your
father? Aright, see this letter?

481
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,760
It's from Colonel Lukic.
It's an order for Kosta.

482
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,960
He has to obey it!
-Veca, have you gone mad?!

483
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,600
What are you staring at, stupid?

484
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,360
Start crying for your lieutenant.
-I don't care, you cry!

485
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:03,040
Youll be crying
your heart out!

486
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:10,400
It's the same as last time, and
that night was the worst battle!

487
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:17,640
You Little snot, you've decided
to get killed! Get into the car!

488
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,720
What's wrong with his Leg?

489
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,760
Hey, what's wrong with his Leg?

490
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,840
They say he fell of his horse.
He must have fallen asleep.

491
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:58,360
More likely the horse fell
asleep. How is he now?

492
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:04,400
They say he's even worse.
-What did you say, Kursula?

493
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,240
Nothing, Sir,
just a personal inquiry.

494
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:22,320
Gentlemen, nothing has changed.
Tonight. Signed by General Stepa.

495
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:27,800
Kursula, your battalion and the
battery of Captain Hadzi-Vukovic,

496
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,520
will be the front ranks
of our division. -Yes, Sir.

497
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,080
Youll have half an hour, while
the sanitary unit passes through.

498
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,160
See if you can get
some supper.

499
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,400
But in half an hour,
you must Leave. -Yes, Sir!

500
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:34,280
Gentlemen,
I wanted to say this before.

501
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,480
But, as usual,
Major Kursula confused me.

502
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:46,120
Despite the exhaustion,
I'm ordering a march to Cer.

503
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:54,880
It's not my order,
nor General Stepa's.

504
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:02,120
The orders come from Serbia.
Tonight, Serbia will be on Cer.

505
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:07,000
If you don't get there now,
you never will.

506
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,640
That's all. You may go.

507
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:32,160
Aleksa, the wounded arriving
are from the Drina Division.

508
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,600
Go and enquire about your
brother. -The Drina Division?

509
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,000
That's what they say.
-Hold this, boy!

510
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,200
Stop staring after him and eat
while you can, you silly child!

511
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,040
I can't, Corporal!
They're all wounded.

512
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,280
I hurried to prepare your food,
but you found a better cook.

513
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,720
He's not better, believe me!
You're the best cook!

514
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,120
Ill get a fire started.
Where's the Commander?

515
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,080
It's too Late, Uncle Trajko.
Well be Leaving soon.

516
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:40,240
They've taken a right beating!
Are they returning from Cer?

517
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:07,600
Medic! Medic!
-What is it?

518
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:14,000
Stop! Why didn't you tell me?
He's taking up two seats!

519
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:25,160
Get him down, quickly!
Get someone else on here. Hurry!

520
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:31,640
Couldn't you find somewhere else,
you damn grave-diggers!

521
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:38,520
Get out of here! I haven't eaten
properly since Arandjelovac!

522
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:48,800
He's only doing his job. Someone
else will come along to bury him.

523
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,240
Proka, can you hear me?
It's me, Aleksa.

524
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:00,480
Leave him alone. He's in no
condition to talk. Let him be.

525
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,000
Where are you taking them?
-To the hospital in Valjevo, Sir.

526
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,920
It's a good hospital, isn't it?
Will this fellow pull through?

527
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,960
Of course he will! The peasants
can withstand almost anything.

528
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,560
Come on, men!
Get ready to move!

529
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,840
Battery, forward march!

530
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:27,080
Take care, Proka!
My battery is Leaving.

531
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:34,720
I beg of you, take care of him!
-What's this? -He might need it.

532
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:46,000
Cer
August 15, 1914

533
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:50,640
Brother Kole, over here!
Hello, Badza!

534
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:56,080
Do you know where you're going?
-I was told to go to Trajan Peak.

535
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:00,480
You're lucky the infantry's here,
or you'd be Lost all night!

536
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:05,400
Over there is Tekeris
and way up there is Trajan.

537
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,200
I sent a patrol
and so should you.

538
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,000
We don't do that.
Our Commander goes himself.

539
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,720
Veca! You, the Sergeant
and two soldiers, follow me!

540
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,800
Miloje, follow on
with the battery!

541
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,240
Stay well, brother!
-Don't worry, Badza!

542
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:58,320
Stop! The gun's stuck!

543
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,600
Dismount! Get the wheel!

544
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,120
Push! Come on!

545
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,480
Let me try!

546
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,160
Why are you just standing there?
Push it, God damn it!

547
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,320
Come on, push!

548
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,400
Get up there!

549
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,960
Did you know that father Trivun
was here? -Who?

550
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,280
Uncle Laza, as well. There was a
message for you. I tore it up.

551
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:57,920
What? -I tore it up, because
I knew what the message was.

552
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,480
No one is allowed to touch the
Commander's mail! Understood?

553
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:05,920
Ill take any punishment,
but don't send me away.

554
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:10,720
Understand how I feel. I know
I can make it in the battery.

555
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,120
I won't go!
-Stop being a pest!

556
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:19,440
Ever since you came,
you've been bothering me!

557
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:29,000
Listen, I've taught you how
to ride, drink and womanise.

558
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:34,120
I didn't want to teach you
this job, that's so bloody.

559
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:38,960
I still think you'd be
of better use elsewhere.

560
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:46,480
We've already gone too far.
I can't send you back.

561
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,920
Thank you, brother Kole.

562
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,400
Halt!

563
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,880
What is it?
Are you Kursula's patrol?

564
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,680
Sorry, Sir, I didn't
see your rank.

565
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:12,520
There's a light a the top of
the hill. It must be our patrol.

566
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:22,840
Where did you see the Light?
-Just below the top of the hill.

567
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,600
Show me the way!

568
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,840
This is our machine gun
detachment. -Lead on!

569
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:43,000
I see the lamps and fires.
-Must be our patrol.

570
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,920
Like hell it is!
Take two men,

571
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:52,560
and tell those men they're not
in a whore house! -Yes, Sir!

572
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:06,520
Hey, you Louts, are you the
patrol of the 2nd division?

573
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:18,480
Hey, you, answer my question!

574
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,000
What did you say?!

575
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,520
They're Austrians!

576
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,200
Get back! Make sure
they don't hear us!

577
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:57,400
What's happening, brother?
Who did you send up there?

578
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,600
It must be your men.
We don't have a machine gun.

579
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,040
I don't like it, brother!
Let's go and see!

580
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:19,480
Hell! It sounds as if a whole
division has opened fire!

581
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,200
Major, Sir, this way!

582
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:43,520
I'm a Czech, Sir.
Feldvebel Novotni.

583
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:48,160
We wanted to surrender.
-Later! Who's up there?

584
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:51,400
The 8th corps. You're
heading straight for them.

585
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:59,680
What?! -The Austrian 8th corps
and the 21st Landwehr division.

586
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:06,320
Sergeant, back to the battery!
-Yes, Sir! -You stay!

587
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:18,640
What is the bugle sounding?
-An alert to prepare to attack.

588
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:28,920
Thanks, brother, if you're
not Lying! -I'm not, Sir!

589
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,960
I surrendered of my own choice.
-Got afraid? -Yes, Sir!

590
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:37,960
You should be. You can't just
waltz in and take over Serbia!

591
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:44,600
Take him to headquarters
and guard him with your life!

592
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:50,480
Where are his boots? -Zivojin
took them when he captured him.

593
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:54,000
Don't make me hang around
Cer for a pair of boots!

594
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,360
Give them back!
-Yes, Sir!

595
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:08,360
Oh, great! They've already
started to fire the artillery!

596
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,120
Since Veliki Bosnjak,
I've been hearing a howitzer.

597
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:18,000
Go up there. It's almost dawn.
Hit them with everything!

598
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,080
Let me know the position of
your men! -I will, brother!

599
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:26,080
Hit their artillery. For now,
they're missing their us.

600
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:37,080
Cer
August 16, 1914

601
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,520
Ready to fire!

602
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:01,640
Sergeant, get me the division
headquarters! -Yes, Sir!

603
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,600
Battery, ready!

604
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:27,680
Hello, Ceda, they've found me!
They're hitting very hard!

605
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:33,720
Where's our artillery? Can
you hear me? Who's that?

606
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:40,800
This is the 2nd battery.
Kursula, is that you?

607
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:50,399
Get off, Ceda! Brother Kole,
start using your guns, already!

608
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:56,399
Ill start to fire, Kursula!
Let me know if I'm on target!

609
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:05,720
Aim at the infantry by
the forest. Drum at 32!

610
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:13,319
Plate at 0!
Distance at 1800m!

611
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:20,000
Shrapnel shell!
Time at 54!

612
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:30,080
Ready! -Left gun, ready!
-Battery, ready!

613
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:33,200
Salvo fire!

614
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:46,760
Too far! Cut it by 300! This
time, hit them with everything!

615
01:09:53,319 --> 01:10:01,760
Distance at 1500m! Time at 47!
Three rapid! Fire!

616
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:14,880
That's it, straight into them!
Get ready to charge!

617
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,640
Hello, Kosta, just keep it up!

618
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,160
Remain at the same elements!

619
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:29,120
Ready, my heroes?
-Ready, Sir!

620
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:33,200
In the name of God. Don't yell
"forward", but "follow me"!

621
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,480
Understood?
-Yes, Sir!

622
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,800
What's happening, brother?

623
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:16,920
Look at them charging this way!

624
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:21,360
We've been informed of 2 Austrian
detachments surrounding us, Sir!

625
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:26,480
Here they are!
What else were you told?

626
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:30,360
If it's anything Like this,
Ill buy you a drink!

627
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:37,040
Hello, hello!
Headquarters!

628
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:54,480
They've found us!
-God damn them!

629
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:57,120
Send out scouts to
find that howitzer!

630
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,360
Hello!

631
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:24,480
Kosta, have you seen the two
columns heading towards you?

632
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:28,000
Yes, I have! Where's Kursula?

633
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:31,240
Hell try for their flanks,
but there's too many!

634
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,360
Get ready to retreat!
-Ail right!

635
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:03,600
Are you all right, down there?
-Yes, Sir!

636
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,480
Where the hell is it firing from?
Sergeant, find it! -I can't!

637
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:11,600
Battery, keep firing!
Same elements!

638
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:43,040
Captain, the Krauts are coming!
Our troops are withdrawing!

639
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:47,320
Keep firing, or theyll take us
prisoner along with our guns!

640
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:50,000
Battery, fire!

641
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:17,480
Sir, the phone's been ringing!
-Have you found the howitzer?

642
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,840
I'm going cross-eyed. It's as
if it's firing from underground!

643
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,720
Yes, all right, Ceda!
Bloody hell!

644
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:49,280
Cease fire! Veca! Miloje!
Sergeant, get the horses!

645
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:55,880
Withdraw towards the village
of Tekeris! -All right, Kosta!

646
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:00,400
Move those guns!

647
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:20,560
All guns, one column,
through the forest!

648
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:25,200
What are you waiting for?
Krauts? Move it!

649
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,920
Attach those guns!

650
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,120
Corporal, wake up!
Attach that gun!

651
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:44,840
Faster! Get moving!
Sergeant, move it!

652
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:03,320
3rd squad, gallop forward!
4th to the Left!

653
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,600
Faster! Faster!

654
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:38,600
Get hold of the wheel!
Keep pulling! Pull!

655
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:49,000
Get out of there, leave the gun!
-But the gun, Sir?

656
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,560
Leave now!
Sergeant, that's an order!

657
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:17,440
The village, Tekeris
August 16, 1914

658
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:43,640
Reporting, General, Sir!

659
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,360
It's you, Kursula? Why did
you leave Cer so quickly?

660
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,720
I would have got them,
but they hit our flanks.

661
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:59,040
I chased them of Trajan, but the
regiment coming from Lesnica...

662
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:04,920
I know. That's not a regiment,
it's their 9th division.

663
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:19,240
What do you think of the enemy?
-They're not what we thought.

664
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:23,760
They can't manage in our hills.
They're scared of knives, bombs.

665
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:30,000
But... -But, what? -They're Large
in numbers and well armed.

666
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:33,200
If they hadn't attacked
from the valley,

667
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,040
I would have reached
the top of Cer!

668
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:48,240
Sir, remember when you
failed my exam on the Drina?

669
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:53,120
I said the Austrian-Hungarian
army would cross the Drina,

670
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:58,720
because it was best for them.
Remember? -Yes, so what?

671
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,960
Well, they did come
across the Drina, after all!

672
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:08,240
They'll pass, just like
you did on your exam.

673
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:17,320
Has the Morava division
arrived yet? -Yes, Sir!

674
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,280
Cease fire!

675
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,360
Keep a lookout!

676
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,840
Remain by your arms!

677
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:06,600
Clean the barrels!

678
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:10,920
Check them thoroughly!
Bring the ammunition!

679
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,320
Yes, Sir!

680
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:25,920
Take a rest. -I can't.
What's going to happen now?

681
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:32,440
I don't know. Stop thinking
about the gun. It's no use.

682
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:38,040
I received your report. Ill see
see you Later regarding that.

683
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:42,840
I believe you had no choice,
but to withdraw.

684
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:47,120
Youll get detailed orders Later.
Well take the same positions.

685
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:52,840
Yes, Sir! -Can I get up there in
this carriage? -Well manage.

686
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,320
The Morova division is gathering
and will advance from your Left.

687
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,360
This will be the decisive moment.
Have your replacements arrived?

688
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:07,120
Yes, Sir, but I was wondering if
the Lieutenant could...

689
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:12,520
Not now, Hadzi-Vukovic, it's too
Late. Your gun was Left up there?

690
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:22,160
Yes. A most unfortunate thing.
Ill send for you later. Branislav!

691
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:07,480
Sir, at Last, some coffee.
It's made with spring water.

692
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:19,480
Where are your cards, old man?
-Who cares about that now?

693
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:22,640
Can you really see
something in them?

694
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:28,680
There is nothing to see.
The cards are dirty and smudged.

695
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:35,960
So, you Lie to them?
-I lie, dear. Listen, Sir.

696
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:40,320
Someone comes to me,
who feels miserable and deserted.

697
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:48,680
I ask him about his
Life, home and family.

698
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:56,280
Then I turn it all around and it
comes out well. -And then?

699
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:03,240
The poor soul wants to hear nice
stories. He's grabbing at straws.

700
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,880
It's just like when you
wish upon a falling star,

701
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:13,920
or find a four-leaf clover.
You believe it's luck.

702
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:23,240
The poor Corporal!
It was his fate. -Yes.

703
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:28,200
Come on, Trajko,
back to work!

704
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:34,440
Captain, Sir, your coffee!
-Thank you, Trajko.

705
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:44,720
I'm writing my report. Subject:
How and why a gun was lost.

706
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:47,520
We know why.
There's no need.

707
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:51,520
Brother Kole, if you think
it's my fault... -Miloje!

708
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:05,800
We're returning to
the same positions.

709
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:16,680
To the left of the forest.
We withdrew through that pass.

710
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:21,400
When we return, we must
go around. Give me the map.

711
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:29,480
Well go to the Left of this hill,
then through the forest.

712
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:33,760
As soon as we're out,
we'll be in our old position.

713
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:08,840
What the hell are you doing?!
-Don't move!

714
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:12,240
You mongrel! Do you
want a court-martial?

715
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:17,320
I won't kill you, just don't
move! -Put that rifle away!

716
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,400
You're a man and I'm not!

717
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:25,360
I was worried about my family
and all you did was insult me!

718
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:32,480
Take a Look! Is she pretty?
-What do you want from me?

719
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,960
I asked you if she was pretty!
-She's attractive.

720
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:40,080
A lot you know! You've
never seen anyone like her!

721
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:44,600
The whole town stared at her!
Men of rank, better than you!

722
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:47,280
You didn't say
you were married.

723
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:51,520
I didn't get a chance! You're
the only one with problems!

724
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:58,600
I didn't know. -She had it all!
I even had my own shop.

725
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:05,280
I know my wife.
-But your wife isn't a whore!

726
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,680
Why do you keep her photo?
Forget the treacherous creature!

727
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:20,000
Why don't you forget Sabac?
Who do you think you are?

728
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:26,000
You've got a pathetic salary
and wife and only you suffer!

729
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:31,160
I was a man! I could have bought
you, together with your salary!

730
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:38,320
Now, I wonder around with a deck
of cards and a photo of a whore!

731
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:52,040
Only you have the right to suffer
and slap others in the face!

732
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,200
It's worth a try.

733
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:08,560
Well carry ammunition, in case
the Austrians destroyed ours.

734
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:13,960
Can I make
a personal suggestion?

735
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:21,800
The Lieutenant, Veca, should do
this. -Are you afraid, Professor!

736
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:26,200
I've done more dangerous things.
-Then, what's the problem?

737
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:31,320
You have to show Veca
that you believe in him.

738
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:40,000
Anyone could have left
that gun, even you.

739
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:45,720
Suppose I send him. It means
I could Lose another gun!

740
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:51,800
You and your bloody gun!

741
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,440
Cer
August 16, 1914

742
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,600
Sir, it's that howitzer again!

743
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:40,680
Kursula, is that you? Kosta's
battery is on the move!

744
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:45,000
Lieutenant Veca is going up to
the gun. He's below you now.

745
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:55,800
I see him, Ceda! Is that the
Morava division I hear?

746
01:28:56,040 --> 01:29:00,480
Yes. We're going to send them
back over the Drina! It's over!

747
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:06,480
It would be, if the Krauts would
sit back and wait to be beaten!

748
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:41,600
Move him, quickly!
Enable that gun!

749
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:01,960
Open quick fire at
the retreating enemy!

750
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:11,440
Listen!
Aim at the farthest point!

751
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:14,760
4th company, follow me!

752
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:24,360
Sir, they didn't touch
the ammunition wagon!

753
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:29,320
Open fire at the enemy!
Distance, 600 metres!

754
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,920
Gunner, keep your eyes open!

755
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:17,000
Sir, they're retreating!
They didn't expect us here!

756
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:22,680
Distance at 500 metres!

757
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:27,640
Watch that grenade and
stop staring like an idiot!

758
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:36,080
That's great!
Fire another ten at 500 metres!

759
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:46,280
They've found us again! It's that
howitzer again! -Get down!

760
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:51,280
I told you to get down!
What are you waiting for?!

761
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:54,960
Sir, as long as you remain
standing, so will we!

762
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,040
Leave him! Keep firing!

763
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:22,920
Fire to the Left!

764
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,920
Kursula is attacking!
We're being hit by the howitzer!

765
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,600
Keep firing!

766
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,560
Faster, boys, faster!

767
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,480
Ready to fire!

768
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:57,200
Clear that ammunition!

769
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:05,440
Hit their infantry! Drum 32,
plate 0, distance 700m!

770
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:08,840
Salvo fire!

771
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:17,120
Miloje, find that howitzer!
I can't see it from here! -Sir!

772
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:32,000
Sir, are you wounded?

773
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:41,720
Get the bandages!
Don't be afraid.

774
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,600
Colonel, Sir.

775
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:58,880
Hadzi-Vukovic, Kursula
has taken the Trajan area.

776
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:02,880
Fire in front of him, towards
Kosanin Grad! -Yes, Sir!

777
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:10,840
That howitzer is hitting us!
-And Kursula as well!

778
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:15,360
Protect him with continuous fire!
The 6th division is to our Left.

779
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:19,960
You must not cease fire!
Understood? -Yes, Sir!

780
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:36,120
Captain, Sir! Kosta!
-Find that howitzer!

781
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:40,880
Sergeant!

782
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:52,000
Miloje, if Kosta asks about me,
don't tell him.

783
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:07,000
Please, he mustn't come here.
Everything has gone to hell.

784
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:14,200
There it is, Lieutenant,
I can see the howitzer!

785
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:19,360
It's in the woods,
to the right of the bridge!

786
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:22,920
You can't see it firing,
because of the forest!

787
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:27,480
Target the enemy howitzer
at the edge of the forest!

788
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:37,040
Drum 32, plate 0, distance 4800m!
Destroy! Three rapid! Fire!

789
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,640
Veca!

790
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:12,360
Where's the Lieutenant?
-Sir, he's right here.

791
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:19,040
How far is the howitzer? -4800m!
Are you listening? -Yes, Sir!

792
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:25,800
The direction is right,
but we're falling too short!

793
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:31,800
Set it to 5200!

794
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:41,520
Damn, how far can they be?!
A second miss! Set it to 5300m!

795
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:49,440
Are you wounded?
-I fell, that's all.

796
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,840
Why do we keep missing?

797
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:58,080
I told you 5300m!
-Sir, that's what we're doing!

798
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,560
Grenade! Get down!

799
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,520
5100!

800
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:27,360
We found them, Sir!

801
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:34,800
Stay at 5100!
Destroy! Rapid fire!

802
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:46,360
Sergeant! Bogi, my gambler!

803
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:10,800
Yes, Sir, I understand!
Cease fire!

804
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:18,200
Cease fire!

805
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:33,320
Miloje, the Austrians
are running towards Cer!

806
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,560
Well follow them to the Drina!

807
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,240
Veca!

808
01:39:01,120 --> 01:39:05,960
Sir, we've taken Kosanin Grad!
-What do you say about that?

809
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:12,520
Stop it! It's taking you all day!
Steva! -Yes, Sir!

810
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:17,600
Inform artillery that we're going
after them, down to the Drina!

811
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:22,480
Yes, Sir! -Sir, you're severely
wounded! You shouldn't go...

812
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:26,480
