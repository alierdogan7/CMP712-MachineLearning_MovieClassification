My lord, for your wife Siggy,

7
00:00:09,382 --> 00:00:10,615
would have you not done the same?

8
00:00:10,616 --> 00:00:12,418
Ragnar Lothbrok can give you nothing,

9
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,420
<i>I on the other hand can
give you a great deal.</i>

10
00:00:14,421 --> 00:00:16,121
<i>This is my daughter, Thyri.</i>

11
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:17,622
She's soon to get married,

12
00:00:17,623 --> 00:00:19,523
and I must think very carefully

13
00:00:19,524 --> 00:00:21,092
about her future husband.

14
00:00:21,093 --> 00:00:24,195
Ragnar Lothbrok killed my brother.

What Ragnar Lothbrok has sworn is true.

18

So unfortunately you cannot punish him.

have noticed that in your world,

slaves are often treated worse than dogs.

Legally you could beat me to death,

58

but why would they get
to know each other better?

275
00:19:03,696 --> 00:19:06,364
Because they're being married.

276
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,569
- But he's...
- It's arranged.

277

You will have no regrets, my dear child.

304

Earl Haraldson: It's an excellent match.

309
00:21:19,485 --> 00:21:21,853
He's a powerful man,

310
00:21:21,854 --> 00:21:23,621
and he's the cousin of King Horik.

311
00:21:23,622 --> 00:21:25,123
Siggy: He's old and he's ugly.

312

Earl Haraldson: You don't
judge a man by the way he looks.

314
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:34,064
We've struck a good deal.

315

He'll give us twenty
pounds of silver for her.

316
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:42,439
Don't you care for her happiness?

317
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,542
I care for her security, and her future...

318
00:21:45,543 --> 00:21:47,476
and ours.

319
00:21:47,477 --> 00:21:51,114
This marriage will bring us land

320
00:21:51,115 --> 00:21:53,549
and important alliances.

321
00:21:55,585 --> 00:21:58,421
The gods must have seen that we need them.

322
00:21:58,422 --> 00:22:01,891
Siggy: You told me
nothing of this marriage.

323
00:22:01,892 --> 00:22:05,593
You have treated me with utter contempt.

324
00:22:06,595 --> 00:22:08,563
You don't care.

325
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:15,938
I stopped caring about a lot of things... 

326
00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:18,506
when our boys were murdered.

327
00:22:19,607 --> 00:22:22,844
Siggy: They died... you buried them.

328
00:22:22,845 --> 00:22:25,112
And for you, it was the end of the matter.

329
00:22:25,113 --> 00:22:26,580
But for me...

330
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,251
they were my sons.

331
00:22:31,553 --> 00:22:32,619

332
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,121
I brought them into this world.

333
00:22:34,122 --> 00:22:35,655
I watched them as they grew.

334
00:22:35,656 --> 00:22:39,893
And I loved them, just as I loved you.

335
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:50,170
The killers,

336
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:52,637
they dug a shallow grave.

337
00:22:55,976 --> 00:22:57,877
And before they buried them...

338
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:03,949
they cut their heads off.

339
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,889
And when they laid them
in the ground, they...

340
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,995
they put their faces against their asses...

341
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,932
as a sign of disrespect.

342
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:29,172
If I ever find the man
who did that... I will...

343
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:46,222

hair from their heads.

when you have such knowledge...

347
00:24:03,906 --> 00:24:08,343
being married to a rich,
old man isn't so bad.

358
00:25:21,297 --> 00:25:22,964

It was Rollo who said that if you're alive,

369
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:52,225
you might be here.

370
00:25:52,226 --> 00:25:55,428
Then why did he not come himself?

371
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,230
<i>Torstein: Because he thought the Earl's men</i>

372
00:25:57,231 --> 00:26:00,166
would be looking for him especially.

373
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:04,769
It is no secret that all of
the crew are being watched.

374
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,839
But I made sure no-one followed me.

375
00:26:09,242 --> 00:26:11,343

377
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:16,014
Torstein: You too, my friend.

378
00:26:24,356 --> 00:26:26,090
This is Helga.

379
00:26:26,091 --> 00:26:29,026
Hello, Helga.

380
00:26:32,297 --> 00:26:36,399
Floki: Oh, don't wiggle
your maggot in her face.

381
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,168

<i>Sit down.</i>

383
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:48,078
I heard they burned down your farm.

384
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:50,213
They also slaughtered all our livestock.

385
00:26:50,214 --> 00:26:51,981
We have nothing left.

386

Ragnar is alive.

388
00:26:57,954 --> 00:27:00,422
Your children are alive.

389
00:27:00,423 --> 00:27:02,424
You have everything left.

390
00:27:02,425 --> 00:27:04,960
<i>Lagertha: We also need to eat.</i>

391
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:09,930
And we are already eating some
of your winter supplies, Floki.

392
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:12,066
And I am ashamed.

393
00:27:13,135 --> 00:27:15,303
The gods will provide.

394
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:23,410
Athelstan: For everything
there is a season,

395
00:27:23,411 --> 00:27:25,979
and a time for every matter under heaven:

396
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,849
A time to be born, and a time to die... 

397
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,285
<i>Floki: (Giggles)</i>

398
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:37,124

399

That is the question I keep asking myself.

Torstein: What are you going to do?

406
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:27,236
Ragnar: I can do nothing until I am well.

407
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,375
Where's the boat?

408
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:38,247
Torstein: Haraldson has
confiscated the boat.

409
00:28:38,248 --> 00:28:41,350
His daughter is getting
married to a man from Svealand.

410
00:28:41,351 --> 00:28:45,487
The boat is her dowry.

411
00:28:47,056 --> 00:28:51,159
Ragnar: Floki can always
build us another one.

412
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,366

it will take time for me to trust you.

00:38:37,043 --> 00:38:38,811
(Flames crackle)

552
00:39:03,702 --> 00:39:05,869
(Approaching footsteps)

553
00:39:17,348 --> 00:39:18,848
(Sighs)

554
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:25,020
(Water splashes, startled gasp)

555
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,026
(Breathing heavily)

556
00:39:32,027 --> 00:39:35,029
Earl Haraldson: Where's Ragnar Lothbrok?

557
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,098
(Tugs on his chains)

558
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:42,103
Where is he?

559
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,039
He's dead.

560
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,108
Are you sure?

561
00:39:49,244 --> 00:39:50,778
(Chuckles)

562
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:54,548
You said that you always tell the truth.

563
00:39:59,554 --> 00:40:02,855
You seem to have a little
trouble opening your mouth.

564
00:40:07,762 --> 00:40:10,664
Perhaps I could make that
a little easier for you.

565
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,634
(Unsheathes dagger)

566
00:40:21,808 --> 00:40:23,409
(Frightened gasps)

567
00:40:25,712 --> 00:40:28,547
(Rollo gurgles as the
knife slices his flesh)

568
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,788
(Flames crackle)

569
00:40:39,991 --> 00:40:42,827
Gyda: When will he be better?

570
00:40:42,828 --> 00:40:45,563
Ragnar: It's taken too long already.

571
00:40:45,564 --> 00:40:49,666
Lagertha: In a few weeks' time
your father's wounds will be healed

572
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:51,501
if he is careful.

573
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:55,939
Bjorn: You must have patience, Father.

574
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,273
(Mockingly) You must have patience, Father.

575
00:40:57,274 --> 00:40:59,042
Shut-up.

576
00:41:01,446 --> 00:41:03,380
(The door bursts open)

577
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:07,817
Bjorn: Torstein!

578
00:41:07,818 --> 00:41:10,586
Floki: I found him
wandering around the marshes.

579
00:41:10,587 --> 00:41:12,421
Torstein: I was lost.

580
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:18,060
I was visited in great secrecy

581
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:20,528
by Earl Haraldson's wife, Siggy.

582
00:41:22,998 --> 00:41:28,503
She told me that her husband
had played a trick on Rollo...

583
00:41:28,504 --> 00:41:31,473
and imprisoned him, trying
to find where you were.

584
00:41:34,477 --> 00:41:36,477
Then he tortured him.

585
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,918
He tortured my brother?

586
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,787
Torstein: Yes.

587
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:52,325
<i>Siggy is sure</i>

588
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:54,794
<i>her husband means to kill him</i>

589
00:41:54,795 --> 00:41:57,530
because Rollo will not,

590
00:41:57,531 --> 00:41:59,799
in any way, admit to where you are.

591
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,668
It's a trap for you, Ragnar.

592
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,405
(Fire crackles)

593
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,785
(Grunts)

594
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:27,391
(Rain patters outside)

595
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,668
(Grunts)

596
00:42:44,742 --> 00:42:46,676
Ragnar: Floki.

597
00:42:55,018 --> 00:42:58,821
I have another favor to ask of you.

598
00:42:58,822 --> 00:43:01,623
I want you to go into Kattegat.

599
00:43:01,624 --> 00:43:03,459
I want you to ask for
a meeting with the Earl.

600
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,960
And when you meet him,

601
00:43:04,961 --> 00:43:07,763
challenge him to a personal combat

602
00:43:07,764 --> 00:43:09,498
with me.

603
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:14,368
Tell him, if he refuses

604
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:16,938
shame will stalk him
for the rest of his life,

605
00:43:16,939 --> 00:43:20,841
and Odin will never
permit him into Valhalla.

606
00:43:20,842 --> 00:43:22,676
♪

607
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,368
Next time on Vikings.

608
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:34,503
They came in three ships,

609
00:43:34,504 --> 00:43:36,405
and those ships are
now sailing up the tide.

610
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:39,407
They have ships that can cross the oceans

611
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,742
but also sail up rivers.

612
00:43:41,743 --> 00:43:42,610
I'm with child.

613
00:43:42,611 --> 00:43:44,312
You have made me a happy man.

614
00:43:44,313 --> 00:43:46,181
The combatants can choose

615
00:43:46,182 --> 00:43:48,016
any weapon and shield they desire.

616
00:43:55,156 --> 00:43:57,057
Would you not like to be
married to another one?

617
00:43:57,058 --> 00:43:58,025
Who?

618
00:43:58,026 --> 00:43:58,859
Me.
