after Hoffman bounced

00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:31,684
I had his body brought back here,
along with his parachute.

447
00:26:31,847 --> 00:26:34,281
You think this was
more than a routine
training accident, major?

448
00:26:34,447 --> 00:26:37,120
I know now, lieutenant,
that it was no accident.

The chute line on Hoffman's

00:26:39,687 --> 00:26:43,123
He jumped out of that plane with
the jump ring in perfect position

451
00:26:43,287 --> 00:26:44,800
and the chute still didn't open.

452
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:47,119
I thought the men
packed their own chutes.

No. My reason is
Hoffman was one

When the Nazis hit Norway,

690

Now, we can try an air strike
at the train in open country,

695

but we can't be sure
they'd get all 12.

696
00:40:59,847 --> 00:41:03,044
And then, we could give
this to British intelligence
at Alexandria.
