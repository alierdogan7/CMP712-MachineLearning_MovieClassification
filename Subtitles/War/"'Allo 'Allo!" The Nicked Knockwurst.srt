1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,476
(Birdsong)

2
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,795
Can it be the breeze that fills the trees

3
00:00:30,795 --> 00:00:35,317
With rare and magic perfume?

4
00:00:35,317 --> 00:00:37,595
Oh, no, it is...

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,751
Are you by any chance thinking

6
00:00:40,751 --> 00:00:44,037
that l am singing in the bath
because l am happy? No.

7
00:00:44,037 --> 00:00:48,875
You are wrong. l am singing in the bath
because there is no lock on the door.

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,232
Happy? l most certainly am not.

9
00:00:53,232 --> 00:00:56,756
The British, who scarpered
like scalded cats at Dunkirk,

10
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:59,149
are obviously not coming to rescue us.

11
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:01,515
They should have been here by now.

12
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:05,149
All they do is send messages
on the wireless to the Resistance

13
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:07,310
telling them to shoot the Germans.

14
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,516
This makes the Germans very cross.

15
00:01:09,516 --> 00:01:12,353
So they, in their turn,
shoot the Resistance

16
00:01:12,353 --> 00:01:14,749
and a few hostages for good measure.

17
00:01:14,749 --> 00:01:18,594
By the time the British get here
there will be nobody left.

18
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:21,353
- (Knocking)
- Who is it?

19
00:01:21,353 --> 00:01:22,634
Oh...

20
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:25,951
lt is l, your wife's mother.

21
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:27,678
Go away!

22
00:01:27,678 --> 00:01:32,788
l-l wish to use the little girl's room... Oh!

23
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:35,155
You are a big girl now.

24
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:37,435
Use the one outside in the yard.

25
00:01:37,435 --> 00:01:40,830
The one outside is frozen!

26
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,388
Well, have a hot cup of cocoa and run.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,672
Will they give me no peace?
As l was saying...

28
00:01:48,672 --> 00:01:51,115
- (Knocking)
- The Brit... What is it now?

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,549
Psst! lt is l, Leclerc.

30
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:59,395
- Er... May l use the erm...
- No, you may not. Get out.

31
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:01,948
As l was saying, the British...

32
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:04,235
- (Knocking)
- What is it?

33
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:08,279
lt is l, Yvette.
Are you ready for two big jugs?

34
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,475
Er, yes, come in.

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,952
- Ah.
- Shall l let you 'ave it?

36
00:02:18,952 --> 00:02:20,792
By my feet, yes.

37
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,110
Ohhh! Oh!

38
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,875
Oh, the old boiler is in a terrible state.

39
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,997
l do not know why l married her
in the first place.

40
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,076
Oh, René,

41
00:02:34,076 --> 00:02:37,709
when we are married,
will it always be like this?

42
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,353
Possibly.

43
00:02:40,353 --> 00:02:47,278
Oh, just the sight of your body
covered in bubbles drives me wild.

44
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:49,999
l will scrrrub your back!

45
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:52,071
Now, where is the soap?

46
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,037
Oh! l will get it.

47
00:02:54,037 --> 00:02:57,157
Ah! There.

48
00:02:57,157 --> 00:02:59,913
There. Be careful with it,
that is all that l 'ave.

49
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,754
Ah. Tonight l will get
a bigger one from the Colonel.

50
00:03:03,754 --> 00:03:05,910
l should not be surprised.

51
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,319
(Edith) René!

52
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,130
René!

53
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,238
How much longer are you going
to be in the bathroom?

54
00:03:14,238 --> 00:03:17,551
My mother wishes
to avail herself of the facility.

55
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:20,029
l told her to use the one in the yard.

56
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:22,111
The British airmen are hiding in it.

57
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:24,509
You'll have to put her in the wheelchair

58
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:27,034
and take her to the one
in the town square.

59
00:03:27,034 --> 00:03:31,511
The Germans have padlocked it
ever since someone wrote on the wall

60
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,831
that poem about Hitler
and his shortcomings.

61
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,916
She'll have to contain 'erself,

62
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,718
l'll be out in a minute.

63
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:42,519
One day you will get what you deserve.

64
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,990
Not with people coming
in and out of the bathroom all day.

65
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:50,517
- What is Yvette doing in here?
- Yes, what are you doing here?

66
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:52,511
Er, l brought in the jugs.

67
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:56,309
Then you have no reason to stay.
Go about your business. Hurry!

68
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:58,755
- Yes, René.
- Oh, René...

69
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:00,796
always the disciplinarian.

70
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:04,634
Would you kindly leave now?
l am about to remove the plug.

71
00:04:04,634 --> 00:04:06,711
l'll fetch you a nice, hot towel.

72
00:04:06,711 --> 00:04:10,918
Oh, Edith, those stairs -
they are too much for you, my dear.

73
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,639
Er, send up Maria.

74
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:17,030
Oh, René, always so thoughtful.

75
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,239
(Loud knocking)

76
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,357
Psst. Are we alone?

77
00:04:23,357 --> 00:04:26,512
Not for very much longer, l suspect.

78
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:30,513
Listen very carefully,
l shall say this only once.

79
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:33,239
Why is it that you say things only once?

80
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,276
l shall say this only once

81
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:38,796
because l am clinging to
a rusty drainpipe.

82
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:41,917
l 'ave a plan to get
rid of the British airmen

83
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:44,514
who are 'iding in your outside bog.

84
00:04:44,514 --> 00:04:48,513
Well, that will be a great relief
to my wife's mother.

85
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:51,751
Now, pay careful attention,
this is the plan.

86
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,957
The brackets 'ave cracked and
are coming away from ze wall.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,956
What does that mean?

88
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:07,396
lt means you are going to need
a new drainpipe.

89
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:09,118
(Screams)

90
00:05:09,118 --> 00:05:11,156
(Crashing)

91
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,668
(Hollow clang)

92
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:17,716
l would go to her assistance

93
00:05:17,716 --> 00:05:20,792
but you will understand
the position l am in.

94
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,039
( Piano introduction)

95
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,157
(Tunelessly)  Love is where you find it

96
00:05:26,157 --> 00:05:29,277
You'd be blinded, it's all around you

97
00:05:29,277 --> 00:05:32,716
-  Everywhere
- (Bell)

98
00:05:32,716 --> 00:05:34,276
Eve-ry-where!

99
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,958
Oh, l will have to stop
putting cheese in my ears.

100
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,758
Why is this, Hans?

101
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:51,389
l woke up this morning,
there was a mouse on my pillow.

102
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:55,109
Mme Edith has an unusual voice.
Was it trained?

103
00:05:55,109 --> 00:05:58,510
Oh, yes...but it escaped
and returned to the wild.

104
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,718
- Your usual, Lieutenant?
- Thank you.

105
00:06:02,718 --> 00:06:04,518
Thank you.

106
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:08,752
You are looking very...
pink and fresh today.

107
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:13,709
l saved up my water ration
and my soap ration to have a bath.

108
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:16,712
l have a very big bath at the chateau...

109
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:19,360
if ever you want to luxuriate.

110
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,750
How the conquering heroes live!

111
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,957
lf it was not for those meddlesome
Resistance people,

112
00:06:25,957 --> 00:06:28,156
it would be quite a peaceful life.

113
00:06:28,156 --> 00:06:31,232
And, er...talking of Resistance...

114
00:06:31,232 --> 00:06:34,278
There are rumours about you, René.

115
00:06:34,278 --> 00:06:39,718
lt is said that you are something
that you don't appear to be at first sight.

116
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:42,155
l have heard the same about you.

117
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,954
l hope l'm not interrupting anything.

118
00:06:45,954 --> 00:06:48,349
l hope you are never
interrupting anything.

119
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:50,795
The Colonel vishes you to sit at his table.

120
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:53,348
l was just going to ask you to sit at mine.

121
00:06:53,348 --> 00:06:55,749
Vell, ve asked first!

122
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,912
First come, first served, l'm afraid.

123
00:06:58,912 --> 00:07:00,877
Maria, take over the bar.

124
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:03,520
Make sure the Lieutenant
gets what he wants.

125
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,955
Oh, can't l just take over the bar?

126
00:07:05,955 --> 00:07:07,553
- René!
- Yes, Colonel.

127
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:10,029
- Sit down.
- How are you today?

128
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:13,715
How is the war going?
Do you have the half-time score?

129
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:16,712
That is what l want to talk
to you about, René.

130
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:20,349
l know you have helped
some British airmen to escape.

131
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:21,714
- Well, l...
- But...

132
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:23,836
l'm prepared to vipe the slate clean.

133
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:25,876
Ah, thank you, Colonel.

134
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:28,952
But you must promise
to stop helping the Resistance.

135
00:07:28,952 --> 00:07:32,828
- Of course, Colonel.
- Promise me on your honour?

136
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:36,708
Colonel, you must understand,
l am in business,

137
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,473
some of the Resistance
could be my customers.

138
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:42,279
- Without my knowing...
- Don't be devious!

139
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,749
Promise me. On your honour.

140
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:47,559
- Well...
- On your honour as a Frenchman.

141
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:50,837
Oh, well, that is different.
You have my word.

142
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,797
Good, you may buy us a drink.

143
00:07:52,797 --> 00:07:57,112
Rrrené! Rrrené,
the most drrreadful thing has happened!

144
00:07:57,112 --> 00:07:59,714
There's a rrrow of sausages
in the kitchen.

145
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:03,349
- Why is that so dreadful?
- Somebody has rrremoved one,

146
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,908
the one with the little swastika on it.

147
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:08,594
- What?
- The one with the swastika?

148
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:12,036
That is the personal sausage
of Herr Flick of the Gestapo.

149
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:16,511
lt contains the painting of the Fallen
Madonna With The Big Boobies.

150
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:18,318
Rolled up.

151
00:08:18,318 --> 00:08:22,359
Don't get confused, Hans,
it contains only the forgery.

152
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:24,829
The real one is still safe in my cellar.

153
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:27,070
There you are, nothing to worry about.

154
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,754
l do have something to worry about,

155
00:08:29,754 --> 00:08:31,831
what if Herr Flick asks for it back?

156
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:34,480
- Tell him it's been nicked.
- He'll have me shot!

157
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,154
No, he won't. l'm the commandant here.

158
00:08:37,154 --> 00:08:39,708
Herr Flick has no authority
to have you shot.

159
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:43,588
He will have to ask the Colonel.
And he will have you shot.

160
00:08:43,588 --> 00:08:47,275
- That makes me feel better.
- René! René!

161
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:50,591
René? You wife is trying
to attract your attention.

162
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:53,478
Take no notice.
lt won't be anything important.

163
00:08:53,478 --> 00:08:57,189
lt may be very important.
She may wish to sing another song.

164
00:08:57,189 --> 00:08:59,475
- René! Go at once!
- Yes.

165
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,158
What is it?

166
00:09:02,158 --> 00:09:05,471
The grandfather clock
in the back room needs winding.

167
00:09:05,471 --> 00:09:08,677
Edith, we have no grandfather clock!

168
00:09:08,677 --> 00:09:12,070
lt is code!
Do you never read your code book?

169
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,515
lt means the Resistance
is in the back room.

170
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:16,556
Oh, 'eck!

171
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,311
Zat English idiot who thinks
he can speak French is outside.

172
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,750
Good moaning.

173
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,277
lt is not ''moaning'', it is evening.

174
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:36,830
- What do you want?
- Michelle of the Resistance

175
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,196
washes to tick to you.

176
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:44,592
She has had a nursty occident
by failing off a drainpoop.

177
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,678
All right, you know the code book,
what is he saying?

178
00:09:49,678 --> 00:09:52,718
Carry her this wee.

179
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,155
And do not let her drip.

180
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,074
She has strooned her back

181
00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:02,994
and has also a compost fricture
of the left log.

182
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,275
Listen very carefully,
l shall whisper this only once

183
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,316
because l am in great pain.

184
00:10:10,316 --> 00:10:13,233
Her log is in Plister of Poris.

185
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,034
My God, what did she land in?

186
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:20,874
l have a plan to get rid
of the British airmen by air.

187
00:10:20,874 --> 00:10:23,394
Oh, no, not that balloon again!

188
00:10:23,394 --> 00:10:26,392
ln the museum
is an exact replica of the plane

189
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:31,474
used by Pierre Laconte
to cross the Channel in 1910.

190
00:10:31,474 --> 00:10:34,358
Pierre Laconte?
l 'ave never heard of him.

191
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:36,396
Think back, you must have done.

192
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,076
lt was not in the paper.

193
00:10:40,076 --> 00:10:42,879
He tried to cross
the Channel before Blériot.

194
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,396
He crashed but the plane
is still airworthy.

195
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,835
Except that there is no engine.

196
00:10:48,835 --> 00:10:51,798
What good is it without an engine?

197
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:55,873
The engine of a lawn mower
would give sufficient power.

198
00:10:55,873 --> 00:10:58,599
So? What do you want me
to do about it?

199
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:01,558
Steal the plane,
find a motor and contact me

200
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:05,394
in bed three, ward seven,
Nouvion General Hospital.

201
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,036
She has pissed out.

202
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,593
- What bravery.
- What fartitude.

203
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,271
You had better get her out of here
before anything worse happens.

204
00:11:23,271 --> 00:11:25,920
And do not drip her... Drop her.

205
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,758
She is ready
for your inspection, Herr Flick.

206
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:43,398
Good.

207
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:46,711
lt's very generous to buy me
a suit out of Party funds.

208
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:48,756
l had no alternative.

209
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:53,231
l could not take you to the Gestapo club
looking any old how.

210
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:55,276
- Now, let me see.
- (Whimpers)

211
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,678
Hm. The shoulders are good.

212
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,671
But the lapels are not good.

213
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
Hmm.

214
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,188
The vaist is good.

215
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,236
But the sleeves are not good.

216
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,278
l think the skirt is excellent.

217
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,873
l do not agree.

218
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,672
- How about the hat?
- Approved.

219
00:12:28,672 --> 00:12:31,957
Herr tailor? You will do better.

220
00:12:31,957 --> 00:12:34,429
Or something nasty vill happen.

221
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:35,999
Yes, Herr Flick!

222
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,317
(Gasps)

223
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,832
l am sorry to interrupt

224
00:12:48,832 --> 00:12:51,559
if you are in the midst
of an interrogation.

225
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:54,871
(Flick) Avert your eyes,
von Smallhausen!

226
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:58,236
l have important news.

227
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:01,869
Helga, retire behind the screen
and reclothe yourself.

228
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:03,916
Yes, Herr Flick.

229
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,312
The Resistance have kidnapped
your Knockwurst sausage

230
00:13:08,312 --> 00:13:11,039
and are demanding a ransom
for its return.

231
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,954
Why should l pay a ransom
for a Knockwurst sausage?

232
00:13:14,954 --> 00:13:18,794
lt appears that the sausage
contains a valuable painting

233
00:13:18,794 --> 00:13:22,077
which you, no doubt,
were keeping safe for Hitler?

234
00:13:22,077 --> 00:13:24,993
That is correct.
When did you learn of this?

235
00:13:24,993 --> 00:13:28,868
l received the information
at 1 1 o'clock this morning.

236
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:33,272
That was four hours ago.
Why did you take so long to inform me?

237
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:37,751
The message was wrapped around
a brick and thrown at my head -

238
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:41,310
l have just regained consciousness.

239
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,233
- This is very serious.
- lt's not as bad as it looks.

240
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,752
The theft of my sausage is serious.

241
00:13:58,752 --> 00:14:01,832
They are demanding 800,000 francs.

242
00:14:01,832 --> 00:14:06,436
lf you do not pay up they will deliver it
to you two inches at a time.

243
00:14:06,436 --> 00:14:08,397
- Helga!
- Yes, Herr Flick?

244
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:10,994
Your Colonel is in charge of security.

245
00:14:10,994 --> 00:14:14,231
Tell him that if the painting
is not recovered

246
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:16,356
he is to burn down the town.

247
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,994
Except for this building.

248
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:21,991
- Yes, Herr Flick.
- Herr Flick...

249
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:25,709
l have a small but comfortable apartment
over the bakery.

250
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:30,191
Could you perhaps make some
special recommendation about it?

251
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:31,191
Yes.

252
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,192
Sell the toaster and do not pay ze rent.

253
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,116
Edith! Yvette! Maria!

254
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:47,274
Ohhh...why does nobody
pay attention to an old woman

255
00:14:47,274 --> 00:14:50,113
when she is banging?

256
00:14:50,113 --> 00:14:52,031
(Gasps and wheezes)

257
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,072
What is the matter? We are busy
downstairs running a business.

258
00:14:58,072 --> 00:15:00,913
Oh, Edith, l am going mad.

259
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:06,154
Why do l keep seeing
strangers in my bed?

260
00:15:06,154 --> 00:15:10,313
Do not worry, Mama,
there are strangers in your bed.

261
00:15:10,313 --> 00:15:13,278
- (Both) Hello!
- (Squeals)

262
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:16,113
Do not be afraid, it is the British airmen.

263
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:19,351
Airmen? B-But w-why...

264
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:24,070
are they dressed like
two decrepit old bats?

265
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,833
Because, if the Germans
search the place,

266
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:29,718
they will not suspect
two old ladies in your bed.

267
00:15:29,718 --> 00:15:34,555
Oh, it seems very strange to me.

268
00:15:34,555 --> 00:15:39,714
lt is strange even to me
and l am a Frenchman.

269
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:41,950
Shut up! Go to sleep.

270
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,639
This is a very serious situation, René.

271
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,748
lf we do not recover the sausage l vill be
compelled to burn down the town.

272
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:54,389
He vill obeying orders.
Ve all have to obey orders.

273
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:56,436
Colonel, it is very simple.

274
00:15:56,436 --> 00:16:00,718
Just give Herr Flick your sausage
containing the real painting.

275
00:16:00,718 --> 00:16:03,155
Tell him you got it from the Resistance.

276
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:05,879
René, it is my pension!

277
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:08,269
- Our pensions.
- All our pensions.

278
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:12,876
You know these Resistance people,
you must explain to them and get it back.

279
00:16:12,876 --> 00:16:16,157
Otherwise their lovely town
will be burned down.

280
00:16:16,157 --> 00:16:18,196
l have news for you.

281
00:16:18,196 --> 00:16:21,795
The rumour is
this is not just any old Resistance.

282
00:16:21,795 --> 00:16:25,589
- lt's the Communist Resistance.
- (Gasps) Communist Resistance?

283
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:28,069
Their funds are low,
they need the money

284
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:31,072
to buy explosives
to blow up your tanks and trains.

285
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:34,357
- lt is all in a good cause.
- Shut up.

286
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,869
Colonel, l have a plan.

287
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:40,474
Helga has a plan.

288
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,355
Why do we not give them the money
and then ambush them and take it back?

289
00:16:54,355 --> 00:16:56,510
lt sounds rather risky, Helga.

290
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,957
But you have at your disposal
a whole regiment of troops.

291
00:17:00,957 --> 00:17:04,430
But if he turned to hand over the money
with a whole regiment

292
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,239
wouldn't the Resistance
become suspicious?

293
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:12,917
Of course they would.
That was a stupid suggestion, Hans!

294
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:15,992
Every time l make a suggestion
you shoot me down.

295
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:18,719
You are destroying my confidence.

296
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:21,075
l feel this big.

297
00:17:21,075 --> 00:17:23,720
l am like a vorm!

298
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,155
Useless, worthless.

299
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:27,992
(Sobs)

300
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:29,911
Have you finished?

301
00:17:29,911 --> 00:17:30,911
Yes.

302
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,428
But l'm very hurt.

303
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,909
Helga, forgive me for asking

304
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:40,151
but where are you going
to get the money?

305
00:17:40,151 --> 00:17:41,639
We can use dummy money!

306
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:44,712
lf you do that
they will shoot you on the spot.

307
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:48,554
Yes! l'm not the only one
who makes stupid suggestions!

308
00:17:48,554 --> 00:17:51,359
That one was a real stinker.

309
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,396
- Colonel...
- (Mocking laugh)

310
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,832
ln the safe in your office
you have the money.

311
00:17:57,832 --> 00:18:00,957
- The troops' wages.
- We have to pay them on Friday.

312
00:18:00,957 --> 00:18:04,715
- What if we don't get it back?
- We could give them lOUs.

313
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:05,675
Two-one.

314
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,791
lt is your town they're going to burn.
You find the money.

315
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:14,316
Where am l supposed to find
800,000 francs?

316
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:17,915
- Have a collection.
- l could sing at all the cafés.

317
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:20,230
They would pay you hush money.

318
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,319
(René) Oh, my God.

319
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,599
Ah! Shhh. lt is l, Leclerc.

320
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:35,915
l have received a message
from the Resistance. (Chuckles)

321
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,956
Er...

322
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,958
This here.

323
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,958
Hang on, there may be a reply.

324
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,190
Not bloody likely.

325
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,437
''Pay the money tomorrow, midday,
or sausage will be sliced.

326
00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:03,954
''Arrangements to follow...''
Oh, my God.

327
00:19:03,954 --> 00:19:07,077
lf they cut it, Herr Flick
will make you burn the town.

328
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:09,913
And everything for which
l have worked and slaved

329
00:19:09,913 --> 00:19:12,639
all these years will be gone.

330
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:15,917
What? Colonel, l am desperate.

331
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:19,834
What is to stop me giving Herr Flick
the painting in my cellar?

332
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:23,390
- A bullet from this.
- Be reasonable, Colonel,

333
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,950
where am l going to get 800,000 francs
by midday tomorrow?

334
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:31,431
- Rob a bank.
- How can l? Everybody knows me.

335
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:34,796
You could wear one of
my stockings over your face.

336
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:39,192
And how am l supposed to see through
30-denier lock-knit lisle thread?

337
00:19:39,192 --> 00:19:42,352
You can see through Helga's stockings.

338
00:19:42,352 --> 00:19:44,158
l expect.

339
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,198
But the banks have guards.

340
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:50,078
l will be shot and finish up
in the mortuary.

341
00:19:50,078 --> 00:19:52,230
The mortuary, of course!

342
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,073
Monsieur Alfonse, the rich undertaker.

343
00:19:55,073 --> 00:19:58,357
- What about 'im?
- He has money. Lots of money.

344
00:19:58,357 --> 00:20:00,795
lt is hidden in his mattress.

345
00:20:00,795 --> 00:20:04,111
Our problem is solved.
Your wife will borrow the money,

346
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:05,997
we will pay for the sausage,

347
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:09,231
the Colonel will lay an ambush
to arrest the communists

348
00:20:09,231 --> 00:20:11,072
and we will recover the ransom.

349
00:20:11,072 --> 00:20:14,550
There is always a simple solution,
is there not?

350
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,952
lnform us as soon as you know
the meeting place. Come on.

351
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,713
Oh... You have to hand it
to these Germans.

352
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:27,473
They are wonderful at organisation.

353
00:20:27,473 --> 00:20:31,917
What is so wonderful?
We have to get the money.

354
00:20:31,917 --> 00:20:34,992
René! l have a message from Michelle.

355
00:20:34,992 --> 00:20:39,710
lf you steal the motor mower
on Thursday, the aeroplane on Friday,

356
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,234
then the airmen can leave on Saturday.

357
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:44,880
l think Michelle has concussion.

358
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,512
(Panting) Have you seen my wife?

359
00:20:53,512 --> 00:20:56,876
She's upstairs
preparing herself in all her finery

360
00:20:56,876 --> 00:20:59,076
for a dinner with M Alfonse.

361
00:20:59,076 --> 00:21:01,355
(Tuts) Oh, René.

362
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:04,796
Why don't you persuade her
to marry M Alfonse?

363
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,110
Then l could be with you forever.

364
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:10,476
Loving you, kissing you...

365
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:12,835
'olding you.

366
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:15,434
Oh, l am so wild about you,

367
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:18,592
l find it 'ard to control myself.

368
00:21:18,592 --> 00:21:20,557
So l see.

369
00:21:20,557 --> 00:21:23,552
You can have a quick cuddle
before she comes down.

370
00:21:23,552 --> 00:21:25,596
(Both) Ohhhh!

371
00:21:25,596 --> 00:21:28,433
Right, time's up. Get the napkins.

372
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:33,594
Ohhh, you... You animal, you!

373
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:36,558
- (Growls)
- (Door closes)

374
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,159
Rrrené!

375
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:41,800
ln a moment your wife will be down.

376
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,509
Lift me in your strong arms,
embrrrace me!

377
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:47,955
Prrress your body to my body.

378
00:21:47,955 --> 00:21:50,474
Crrrush your lips to my lips.

379
00:21:50,474 --> 00:21:53,120
(Gasping) Bury your face in my neck!

380
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,634
Rrruffle my hair!

381
00:21:55,634 --> 00:21:57,915
- Oh!
- (Bell chimes)

382
00:21:57,915 --> 00:22:01,117
You have just failed to beat the clock.

383
00:22:01,117 --> 00:22:03,316
René, M Alfonse is 'ere.

384
00:22:03,316 --> 00:22:07,359
Maria, get the soup, you put
the napkins down and come with me.

385
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,471
Ah, M Alfonse,

386
00:22:10,471 --> 00:22:13,313
welcome to my humble restaurant.

387
00:22:13,313 --> 00:22:15,789
René, l was burying
the widow Blanquette

388
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:17,836
when l received the invitation -

389
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,876
l dropped everything.

390
00:22:19,876 --> 00:22:24,158
- Ah, M Alfonse.
- Mme Edith.

391
00:22:24,158 --> 00:22:27,789
l feel like a man 20 years younger.

392
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:30,599
So does she but we need his money.

393
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,556
l have arranged for us
a little dinner for two

394
00:22:35,556 --> 00:22:37,471
in the private room in the back.

395
00:22:37,471 --> 00:22:38,191
Alone?

396
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,635
But what about M René,
the hero of the Resistance?

397
00:22:43,635 --> 00:22:46,439
Er, l am going to be heroic
behind the bar.

398
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:49,353
But our meeting concerns
the Resistance.

399
00:22:49,353 --> 00:22:52,432
We feel it is time you joined our ranks.

400
00:22:52,432 --> 00:22:57,196
To kill and to die for France
is the dearest wish of any Frenchman.

401
00:22:57,196 --> 00:22:59,919
Then you should be easily satisfied.

402
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,956
Step this way, please.

403
00:23:01,956 --> 00:23:04,031
Maria? The soup.

404
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,917
Would you care for a rrroll
with your rrrepas?

405
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:19,036
- Thank you.
- (Banging on table)

406
00:23:19,036 --> 00:23:21,350
That will do, girl. You may leave us.

407
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,432
Allow me, Madame...

408
00:23:29,432 --> 00:23:33,718
to fill your bowl as
l would wish to fill your life.

409
00:23:33,718 --> 00:23:36,792
Oh, M Alfonse,
you are such a gentleman.

410
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:39,838
l endeavour
always to be refined, Madame,

411
00:23:39,838 --> 00:23:43,515
in my thoughts,
my words and my deeds.

412
00:23:43,515 --> 00:23:45,556
(Loud slurping)

413
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,876
Delicious.

414
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,678
- Have you seen the pepeer?
- Yes, the news is terrible.

415
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,034
l was referring to the pepper
for the soup.

416
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:14,918
- lt is on the side table.
- Of course.

417
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,513
One twist or two?

418
00:24:29,513 --> 00:24:30,513
Two.

419
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,999
lt is old but it still grinds.

420
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,639
And now, Madame...
to what do l owe the honour

421
00:24:57,639 --> 00:24:59,950
of this delightful dinner?

422
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,116
(Slurping)

423
00:25:03,116 --> 00:25:07,318
My fiancé René lives a life
of constant danger.

424
00:25:07,318 --> 00:25:09,914
Any moment he may fall off his perch.

425
00:25:09,914 --> 00:25:12,798
Perish the thought, Madame.

426
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:14,757
(Slurping)

427
00:25:14,757 --> 00:25:18,879
There must be someone
who will do what he has been doing.

428
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,749
Madame...l tremble
with excitement and anticipation.

429
00:25:28,749 --> 00:25:31,070
- ln the Resistance.
- Oh.

430
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,594
This also l will do.

431
00:25:33,594 --> 00:25:36,990
- Just call me when l'm needed.
- You are needed now.

432
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,036
(Whimpers)

433
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,596
- ln the Resistance?
- Shhh!

434
00:25:42,596 --> 00:25:45,911
Just tell me, Madame,
how a weak, short-sighted,

435
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:50,198
slightly crippled old man
with a dicky ticker...

436
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:54,592
can help you and you will receive
my fullest cooperation.

437
00:25:54,592 --> 00:25:57,638
We need funds. Money.

438
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,035
Oh, of course.

439
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,712
The Resistance do not take cheques.

440
00:26:05,712 --> 00:26:08,598
Pardon my stupidity, Madame, of course.

441
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,396
l 'ave my wallet.

442
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:15,756
- Just name the figure.
- lt is a lot.

443
00:26:15,756 --> 00:26:18,877
No sacrifice will be too great.

444
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,996
800,000 francs.

445
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,834
M Alfonse!
Keep breathing, keep breathing!

446
00:26:35,834 --> 00:26:38,480
Keep breathing, keep breathing.

447
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,279
Do you think
she's going to get the money?

448
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,794
She is certainly earning it.

449
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,190
Hans, are you sure
this is the right bridge?

450
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,953
Yes, Colonel,
this is definitely the place.

451
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:03,396
René should be here
vith the money at midday.

452
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,833
ls the secret camera operating correctly?

453
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,876
l vill demonstrate, Colonel.

454
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,069
(Hooting, shutter clicks)

455
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,551
Do you think anyone will suspect an owl
vith a three-second exposure?

456
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,871
Only another owl, Colonel.

457
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,439
Keep still, Hans.
Trees don't wriggle up and down.

458
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:37,354
l'm sorry, Colonel.
l am having a problem vith a squirrel.

459
00:27:37,354 --> 00:27:39,590
l think he's looking for some nuts.

460
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,271
My ambush troops should be
taking up position by now.

461
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,391
l cannot see them, Colonel.

462
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:50,630
Of course you can't, Hans.

463
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:55,157
They're disguised in a manner
that will not arouse suspicion.

464
00:27:55,157 --> 00:27:57,879
Left, right, left, right,

465
00:27:57,879 --> 00:28:02,317
left, right, left, right, left, right...

466
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,432
lt is all right, Herr Flick, the coast is clear.

467
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,393
Do you think we are safe from detection?

468
00:28:21,393 --> 00:28:23,835
Definitely. No one vould suspect us

469
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:27,276
dressed in the manner
of girls of the Resistance.

470
00:28:27,276 --> 00:28:29,874
Can you see the rendezvous, Herr Flick?

471
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,795
l am observing through
my powerful binoculars.

472
00:28:34,795 --> 00:28:37,553
Have you anything to report?

473
00:28:37,553 --> 00:28:45,513
An owl has just raised its feathers to
reveal a 35mm Leica between its legs.

474
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,599
Perhaps it is the mating season.

475
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,750
(Shutter clicks)

476
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,869
Put it away, Hans.

477
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:03,838
l can see the ambush.
They're in position.

478
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,796
Where is René with the money? He's late.

479
00:29:09,796 --> 00:29:13,350
Maybe he was arrested
by the troops at the roadblock.

480
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,954
You underestimate me, Hans.

481
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,315
l have equipped him with a disguise

482
00:29:18,315 --> 00:29:22,518
that will enable him to pass freely
though the countryside.

483
00:29:22,518 --> 00:29:25,068
Left, right, left, right, left, right,

484
00:29:25,068 --> 00:29:27,435
left, left, right, left...

485
00:29:27,435 --> 00:29:29,476
(Shouting gibberish)

486
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,628
Shut up! Can you never
underplay anything?

487
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,552
- There is the bridge.
- Eh?

488
00:29:37,552 --> 00:29:41,155
Where we are to meet the girls
of the Communist Resistance.

489
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,237
There is the bridge where
we are to meet René's party.

490
00:29:49,237 --> 00:29:51,754
They will be disguised as Germans.

491
00:29:51,754 --> 00:29:54,274
Germans?

492
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,796
Halt. Zere is ze bridge.

493
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:03,590
To the left you will be observing
the girls of the Communist Resistance.

494
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,752
Zay will be in possession of the sausage.

495
00:30:06,752 --> 00:30:09,752
Beyond the bridge
you will see the café owner

496
00:30:09,752 --> 00:30:12,752
and his party disguised
as German soldiers.

497
00:30:12,752 --> 00:30:16,435
Zay will be in possession
of the ransom money.

498
00:30:16,435 --> 00:30:20,274
Everything is proceeding
according to plan.

499
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,199
l'm not much to look at

500
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:30,316
Not much to see

501
00:30:30,316 --> 00:30:35,190
Just glad l'm living and lucky to be

502
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:39,478
But l've got a someone
who's crazy for me

503
00:30:39,478 --> 00:30:42,279
l'm funny that way

504
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,719
Halt zere.

505
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:50,156
- Do you have the money?
- Yes, we have the money.

506
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:53,232
- Do you have the sausage?
- lt is here.

507
00:30:53,232 --> 00:30:56,039
Bring ze money forward.

508
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,715
Place it on the ground.

509
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,390
Retire ten paces.

510
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,799
When we have checked the money,
then you will get the sausage.

511
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,390
Halt!

512
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:29,950
What is going on here?
This is very suspicious.

513
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:33,112
Erich, Kurt, sit!

514
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,999
(Scoffs) These communists,
they trust nobody.

515
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:40,798
lt is all there!

516
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,429
We'll get it all back again
when the Colonel's troops arrive.

517
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:46,351
Where are they?

518
00:31:46,351 --> 00:31:49,318
ln a moment they will arrive
