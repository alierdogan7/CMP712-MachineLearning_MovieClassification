00:58:08,488 --> 00:58:15,028
YOU GUYS MIGHT BE ABLE TO
HOLD IT IN ALL NIGHT, BUT
I GOTTA GO TO THE LATRINE.

878
00:58:15,195 --> 00:58:15,795
JA!

879
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:18,198
I TOO MUST RELIEVE MYSELF.

880
00:58:19,265 --> 00:58:20,467
FRITZ, DARLING!

881
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,769
WHEN YOU ARE DONE
YOU AND PETER CAN
BRING IN THE DISHES.

882
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:49,996
I SUSPECT I KNOW YOUR
SECRET, FRAU VINCKEN.

883
00:58:50,096 --> 00:58:53,400
I HAVE NO SECRETS LIEUTENANT.

884
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:56,536
ARE YOU SURE?

885
00:58:58,772 --> 00:59:07,280
THIS IS A UNIQUE SITUATION,
BUT TEMPORARY, I ASSURE YOU.

886
00:59:07,414 --> 00:59:13,019
TOMORROW WE SOLDIERS
MUST GO BACK TO WAR.

887
00:59:13,153 --> 00:59:18,024
BACK TO OUR OPPOSING SIDES.

888
00:59:18,158 --> 00:59:22,062
WHOSE SIDE WILL YOU
BE ON, FRAU VINCKEN?

889
00:59:22,162 --> 00:59:29,102
OR MORE PRECISELY WHOSE SIDE
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE ON?

890
00:59:29,202 --> 00:59:32,405
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

891
00:59:32,539 --> 00:59:38,144
JUST THAT I KNOW
WHY YOU ARE HERE.

892
00:59:38,244 --> 00:59:42,415
IT BOTHERED ME WHY A MOTHER
WOULD BRING HER SON UP
THROUGH OUR LINES WHILST A

893
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:44,250
GREAT BATTLE IS RAGING.

894
00:59:44,417 --> 00:59:47,654
USUALLY CIVILIANS
GO THE OTHER WAY.

895
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:49,823
BUT NOT YOU.

896
00:59:49,956 --> 00:59:51,891
WHY?

897
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:57,831
BECAUSE YOU HOPE TO
GET THROUGH OUR LINES
TO THE AMERICAN SIDE.

898
00:59:57,964 --> 01:00:02,702
AND WHY WOULD I
DO SUCH A THING?

899
01:00:02,869 --> 01:00:05,705
FOR FRITZ!

900
01:00:05,872 --> 01:00:13,313
YOU SEE IT OCCURRED TO ME
THAT THROUGH EVERY TOWN
WE WENT THROUGH BOYS MUCH

901
01:00:13,446 --> 01:00:17,217
YOUNGER THAN HE WERE
ALREADY BEARING ARMS.

902
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:18,018
BUT NOT HE.

903
01:00:18,151 --> 01:00:22,355
WHY NOT?

904
01:00:22,455 --> 01:00:25,558
HOW IS IT THAT HE IS THE
ONLY BOY HIS AGE WHO HAS
NOT RECEIVED HIS

905
01:00:25,692 --> 01:00:29,829
CALL-UP PAPERS YET?

906
01:00:29,929 --> 01:00:34,000
OR HAS HE?

907
01:00:37,771 --> 01:00:41,608
I MAKE NO EXCUSES.

908
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:45,211
I HAVE ALREADY LOST ONE
SON AND POSSIBLY A HUSBAND.

909
01:00:45,345 --> 01:00:53,520
I WILL NOT SEE MY ONLY
REMAINING SON GIVE HIS LIFE
FOR A CAUSE I NO LONGER

910
01:00:53,687 --> 01:00:57,657
BELIEVE IN.

911
01:00:59,459 --> 01:01:01,695
WELL I THINK THIS
IS THE LAST OF IT.

912
01:01:02,062 --> 01:01:04,297
EXCUSE ME, LIEUTENANT.

913
01:01:07,434 --> 01:01:11,838
SO GUYS, WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO DO ABOUT DRESSING UP THAT
NAKED CHRISTMAS TREE HUH?

914
01:01:11,971 --> 01:01:13,606
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY DECORATIONS?

915
01:01:13,673 --> 01:01:14,708
NOT YET!

916
01:01:14,874 --> 01:01:19,112
LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN FIND.

917
01:01:19,279 --> 01:01:19,679
WELL, COME ON.

918
01:01:19,713 --> 01:01:20,814
LET'S GO.

919
01:01:20,947 --> 01:01:21,481
COME ON.

920
01:01:21,514 --> 01:01:22,449
LET'S GET TO THE TREE.

921
01:01:22,582 --> 01:01:23,850
COME ON PETER.

922
01:01:27,754 --> 01:01:32,392
DANKE.

923

CIGARS AND PINEAPPLE PUDDING.

924
01:01:36,196 --> 01:01:40,000
A FEW KILOMETERS FROM
HOME AND YET WE BARELY
HAVE ENOUGH RATIONS,

925
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:46,172
AND AMERICA IS AN OCEAN AWAY
AND YOU HAVE EVERYTHING.

926
01:01:46,306 --> 01:01:50,577
WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED
BREATHING HEAVY YET.

927
01:01:55,415 --> 01:01:57,884
THAT KID THERE, HEINRICH.

928
01:01:58,051 --> 01:02:02,122
HOW OLD IS HE?

929
01:02:02,255 --> 01:02:08,995
TURNS FIFTEEN NEXT SPRING
IF HE SURVIVES THAT LONG.

930
01:02:09,362 --> 01:02:13,400
WE NOW FEED CHILDREN
TO THE MEAT GRINDER.

931
01:02:16,002 --> 01:02:18,171
WHAT ABOUT THE ONES
THAT DO SURVIVE?

932
01:02:18,271 --> 01:02:23,176
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
MAKE THEM KIDS AGAIN
WHEN ALL THIS IS OVER?

933
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:28,615
I DON'T KNOW.

934
01:02:28,782 --> 01:02:30,116
AND YOUR BOY IN THERE.

935
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:33,887
THE WOUNDED ONE.

936
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:34,988
HOW OLD IS HE?

937
01:02:35,088 --> 01:02:37,090
TWENTY ONE.

938
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:39,426
HE'S AN OLD MAN IN THIS GAME.

939
01:02:39,492 --> 01:02:45,231
HE MAY EVEN GET
TO BE A LITTLE BIT
OLDER, THANKS TO YOU.

940
01:02:48,368 --> 01:02:53,840
IT IS DIFFICULT HUH, NOT TO
GET CLOSE TO THE GOOD ONES.

941
01:02:53,973 --> 01:02:56,242
HERBIE?

942
01:02:56,376 --> 01:02:58,378
WORST SOLDIER I'VE EVER SEEN.

943
01:02:58,511 --> 01:03:01,448
CAN'T CLEAR HIS
WEAPON - BUNCHES UP
WITH THE OTHER GUYS.

944
01:03:01,581 --> 01:03:05,785
CAN'T PUT HIM ON THE
POINT 'CAUSE HE'S
ALWAYS DAY DREAMING.

945
01:03:05,885 --> 01:03:09,322
AH, YOU NEVER DAY
DREAM, SERGEANT?

946
01:03:09,456 --> 01:03:14,427
SOMETIMES IT IS
WHAT KEEPS ME ALIVE.

947
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:18,698
OH HERBIE DAY DREAMS
ALL THE TIME, AND THAT
CAN GET YOU KILLED

948

949
01:03:21,634 --> 01:03:24,004
BEEN WITH ME SINCE DAY ONE.

950

HIM, MEATBALL PRESTIANNI,
WINKIE KAHLER, JOHNNY SIMONE.

951
01:03:29,642 --> 01:03:31,044
A GREAT BUNCH OF GUYS.

CAME OVER TOGETHER IN
'42, OFF A TROOPSHIP,
ONTO A LANDING CRAFT,

INTO NORTH AFRICA,
ITALY, NOW HERE.

954
01:03:42,956 --> 01:03:50,096
ALONG THE WAY I LOST EVERY
ONE OF THEM EXCEPT HERBIE.

955
01:03:50,196 --> 01:03:52,866
WORST DAMN SOLDIER
I'VE EVER SEEN.

956
01:03:54,134 --> 01:03:55,669
WHAT IS IT, SON?

957
01:03:55,702 --> 01:04:00,407
MY MOTHER WANTED ME TO TELL
YOU THAT WE ARE DECORATING
THE CHRISTMAS TREE.

958
01:04:00,573 --> 01:04:01,875
WOW!

959
01:04:02,008 --> 01:04:04,611
WE BETTER GO
INSIDE THEN, HUH.

960
01:04:20,427 --> 01:04:23,663
I SEE YOU ARE NOT A
TRADITIONALIST, FRAU VINCKEN.

961

OH NO?

962
01:04:24,497 --> 01:04:26,032
HOW'S THAT?

963
01:04:26,166 --> 01:04:29,903
THE LIEUTENANT IS REFERRING
TO THE FACT THAT IN OUR
COUNTRY THE CHILDREN ARE NOT

964
01:04:30,003 --> 01:04:33,006
PRESENT FOR THE
DECORATING OF THE TREE.

965
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:34,674
THAT'S A BUM DEAL.

966
01:04:34,774 --> 01:04:38,111
THEY MISS HALF THE FUN.

967
01:04:38,244 --> 01:04:39,579
YES.

968
01:04:39,612 --> 01:04:43,483
BUT AS WE ALL KNOW
OUR HOSTESS PREFERS TO
DO THINGS HER OWN WAY.

969
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:45,118
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

970
01:04:45,251 --> 01:04:48,388
IF THERE WERE MORE OF YOU
LIKE HER, NOT ONE OF US
WOULD BE HERE RIGHT NOW.

HE WILL DO WHAT YOU TELL HIM.

1224
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:39,546
WELL, GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

1225
01:24:41,081 --> 01:24:43,183
GOOD LUCK, LIEUTENANT.

1226
01:24:57,097 --> 01:24:59,132
PRIVATE RASSI.

1227
01:25:04,004 --> 01:25:05,572
FRAU.

1228
01:25:37,937 --> 01:25:40,173
I GUESS THIS IS IT.

1229
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:42,342
THANK YOU ELISABETH!

1230
01:25:43,877 --> 01:25:46,012
YOU KEEP YOUR HEAD UP AND
YOUR EYES ON THE STARS.

1231
01:25:46,146 --> 01:25:48,214
JA.

1232
01:25:48,882 --> 01:25:50,984
TAKE CARE, BUDDY!

1233
01:25:52,619 --> 01:25:54,754
ELISABETH, THANK YOU.

1234
01:25:56,322 --> 01:25:59,092
TAKE CARE OF
YOURSELF JIMMY.

1235
01:26:00,527 --> 01:26:02,529
ALL RIGHT YOU.

1236
01:26:02,696 --> 01:26:04,330
LET'S MOVE OUT.

1237
01:26:05,031 --> 01:26:06,032
COME ON PETER.

1238
01:26:06,199 --> 01:26:08,735
MAYBE YOU CAN TEACH
ME SOME GERMAN, HUH?

1239
01:26:15,942 --> 01:26:19,546
(OLDER FRITZ) IT WAS
 JUST AFTER EIGHT O'CLOCK
 ON CHRISTMAS MORNING.

1240
01:26:19,713 --> 01:26:28,254
LATER THAT DAY AN AMERICAN
 PATROL CAME BY AND THE WAR
 FOR US WAS FINALLY OVER.

1241
01:26:30,357 --> 01:26:34,761
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT
 IT ALL HAPPENED RIGHT HERE.

1242
01:26:36,062 --> 01:26:37,664
IT TRULY IS AN AMAZING STORY.

1243
01:26:37,797 --> 01:26:40,166
THEY WERE AMAZING PEOPLE.

1244
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,635
I GUESS SO.

1245
01:26:42,736 --> 01:26:44,237
BUT YOU NEVER SAW
MOST OF THEM AGAIN.

1246
01:26:44,371 --> 01:26:45,772
NO.

1247
01:26:45,939 --> 01:26:48,241
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE GERMAN SOLDIERS.

1248
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:53,613
AND AS FOR THE AMERICANS
- WELL I MET SERGEANT
BLANK ONCE IN MARYLAND.

1249
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:58,985
BUT YOUR GRANDFATHER WAS
THE ONLY ONE WITH WHOM
I HAD REGULAR CONTACT.

1250
01:26:59,085 --> 01:27:06,259
AND NOW PERHAPS I
SHOULD GIVE YOU THESE.

1251
01:27:06,259 --> 01:27:13,466
AND NOW PERHAPS I
SHOULD GIVE YOU THESE.

1252
01:27:15,435 --> 01:27:17,404
YOU HAD THESE ALL THIS TIME?

1253
01:27:17,537 --> 01:27:19,806
HE INSISTED I KEEP
THEM FOR LUCK.

1254
01:27:19,939 --> 01:27:25,412
I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE THEM.

1255
01:27:25,545 --> 01:27:28,615
THANKS.

1256
01:27:29,516 --> 01:27:31,184
WELL I GUESS WE
SHOULD GET GOING.

1257
01:27:31,317 --> 01:27:35,055
JA.

1258
01:27:35,989 --> 01:27:38,758
STILL KEEP YOUR
EYES ON THE STARS?

1259
01:27:38,892 --> 01:27:40,927
OH YEAH.

1260
01:27:41,061 --> 01:27:45,165
EVERY TIME I LOOK UP
AT SIRIUS IT REMINDS ME
THAT WITH GOOD INTENTIONS

1261
01:27:45,298 --> 01:27:47,400
EVERYTHING'S POSSIBLE.

1262
01:27:47,534 --> 01:27:52,505
LIKE THAT NIGHT WHEN BECAUSE
OF ONE WOMAN A GROUP OF
MEN CAME TOGETHER AS BITTER

1263
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:57,377
ENEMIES PARTED
AGAIN AS FRIENDS.
