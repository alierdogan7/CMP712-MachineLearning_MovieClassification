OF LEGENDS STILL ALIVE
IN ALL MEMORIES...

19
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,900
IS PULLED THIS MOVIE
SHOT IN A NEW STYLE.

20
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,380
The place: the region of the Lake Biwa.
The time: end of the 16th century

21
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,620
What's this noise?

22
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,300
Spies, probably.

23
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,300
It's necessary that I have this
before the fight begins.

24
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,620
Can you sell everything in Nagahama?

25
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,220
Yes. Hashiba's army arrival
brought prosperity.

26
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,060
Shall I come with you?

27
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,900
No! These soldiers
are without mercy for the women.

28
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:39,700
Besides who would take care of
Genitchi, our son?

29
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,980
You are stupid,
to dream such a thing!

30
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,100
The ambition, as the ocean...

31
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,780
must be without limits!

32
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,460
You a Samurai..?
You don't even know how to fight!

33
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,620
Continue working with my brother.

34
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,220
You will see!
In the name of the War god!

35
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,150
I have had enough, of misery!
I'll come with you.

36
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,860
Stop thinking about these madness.

37
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,620
I'll pull your cart.

38
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,140
Be reasonable.

39
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,380
No, my brother. He believes that glory
awaits him in in the city.

40
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,420
He is stupid!

41
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,780
They are mad, with their ideas,
Tobei Genjuro!

42
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:55,820
The so easily won money
fly off quickly.

43
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,340
It overexcites
the imbecile desires!

44
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,780
The war approaches.
They'd better prepare for it.

45
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,180
Say that to Genjuro.

46
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,180
Here's Dad coming home!

47
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,020
Look at that!

48
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,060
Can you imagine!

49
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,870
What a beautiful profit!

50
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:49,540
I came back in hurry,
to show it to you.

51
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,820
That's what i call trade!
Do you understand?

52
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,820
And Tobeï?

53
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,270
He followed a great Samurai,

54
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,430
Despite my advice.

55
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,700
Lord! Take me to your service.
I am brave.

56
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,740
Go away filthy beggar !

57
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,460
you would need an
armor.
And a spear.

58
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,380
And I could be a Samurai?

59
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,500
You are still there?

60
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,580
And your armor?

61
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,700
You are splendid ! Are you happy?

62
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,700
You are superb!

63
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,740
You make me so happy !

64
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,460
For years, I wanted
to buy you pretty things.

65
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,340
Finally, my dream
comes true.

66
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,140
I am so happy
to see you happy!

67
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,740
It is not because of the kimono...

68
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,620
but because of your love.

69
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:12,700
My only desire is to keep you close to me.

70
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,660
I also brought some supplies.

71
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:28,500
Smoked Fish... oil...
flour... rice cakes!

72
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,620
Without money, there is only misery.
And hope dies!

73
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,740
I want to bring back even more money!

74
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,340
I will work harder...

75
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,620
I will make masses of potteries!

76
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,660
Stop for now, Genjuro.

77
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:09,140
The chief of the village announces
the arrival of the Shibata army.

78
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,950
Stay home.

79
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,260
Stupid! The war is good for trade.

80
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,700
See that beautiful profit!

81
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,020
And if luck abandodonned you?

82
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,980
If something happened to you ..?

83
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,060
don't worry!

84
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,940
Here... Ohama!

85
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,860
My brother!

86
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,340
don't torment him.

87
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,100
No Samurai will hire
a poor peasant.

88
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:40,020
He will qickly come back!
Let's have a hot drink.

89
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,300
Idiot! Do you understand..?

90
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,340
Look at you...
the silliest of the whole village!

91
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,510
You can spin!

92
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:29,020
Send him away,
he embarrasses us.

93
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,740
Behave yourself, my boy.

94
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,900
Mom... I am hungry!

95
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,870
He irritates me!.. Let's go, spin!

96
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,860
You change so much!

97
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,060
You become irate.

98
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:59,260
I only want a thing:
to work together.

99
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,380
All three.

100
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,620
nothing else matters.

101
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,460
You work hard!

102
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,860
because I have a plan.

103
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,620
We will go to Nagahama.
And we will become rich!

104
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,630
I will have a share?

105
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,830
Of course! A third of the sale.

106
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,020
I need money so much!

107
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,030
I never saw them working like that.

108
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,510
They live only for this oven.

109
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,300
Bodies and soul! both of them.

110
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,340
If it fails,
what will they become?

111
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,380
what he has should be enough.

112
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,310
But no!

113
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:41,460
He was so quiet, until now!

114
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,590
War changes people so much!

115
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,980
don't antagonize them.

116
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,140
Listen!

117
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,540
Stand up, Genjuro!

118
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,420
That must be the Shibata army!

119
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,860
Tobeï, what's happening?

120
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,700
All the neighbors run away!

121
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,420
What shall we do?

122
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,580
the fire... It's going to die out...

123
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,550
It must not!

124
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,750
They arrive!
They are going to strip us!

125
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,460
Genitchi!..

126
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,580
The Shibata army is there!

127
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,420
The Shibata army... Run!

128
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,150
They will take the men!

129
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,420
If they had only arrived tomorrow!

130
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,980
Let's go, quickly, there is danger!

131
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,300
My fortune is in this oven!

132
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,860
But your life is lot more precious!

133
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,580
Take some rice! We will need
it in the mountain.

134
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,020
Ohama... Quickly!

135
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,860
Help..!

136
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,620
Spare our men,
or we will die of hunger!

137
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,180
Here, it's cooked.

138
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,780
We can eat.

139
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,940
What's happenning?

140
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,780
This Tobeï! What an idiot !

141
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,780
Didd you saw my husband?

142
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,980
No, nowhere.

143
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,340
Who's there..?

144
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,510
Everything has calmed down

145
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,860
We can't hear a thing.

146
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,260
Genjuros, where are you going..?

147
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,060
Patience!
They won't remain here long.

148
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,110
You'd better wait.

149
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,700
I can't, I have to leave.

150
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,900
We will be ruined!

151
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,620
Sacrify the batch!..
And if you were taken?

152
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,940
We can't let it die out!

153
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,700
We'll start again. Later!

154
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,540
I don't want to abandon my oven!

155
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,860
It died out!

156
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,780
No more hope.

157
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,700
Some must hide there.

158
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,660
Let's search everywhere!

159
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,550
Nothing but pots!

160
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:38,110
They are cooked!

161
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,500
Look... they are finished!

162
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,150
They are saved?

163
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,670
Yes, all cooked. Thanks Heaven!

164
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,270
Then, we return to the city?

165
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,660
This time, we will cross the lake.

166
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,220
Ohama is a good rower.
Let her come.

167
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,620
Can we arrive?

168
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,180
Yes, by taking a shortcut.

169
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,940
And the boat?

170
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,860
We will surely find one on the beach.

171
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,590
Careful, the fog is thick.

172
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,740
Genitchi, do you see the lake?

173
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,940
It is pretty.

174
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,580
Finally, out of danger!

175
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,470
Glad that we go there by water.

176
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,140
By the fields, we could have been killed.

177
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,420
In the morning, we will be in Omizo...

178
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,420
Where the castle of
the Lord Niwa is.

179
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,740
It is a much bigger city
than Nagahama.

180
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,900
We will be rich!

181
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,540
And our wives too!

182
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,870
I will have a
vast warehouse built.

183
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,820
I will buy an armor!

184
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,510
Look... a boat!

185
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,900
A ghost!

186
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,860
No, I am not a ghost.

187
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,270
But a fisher, from Kaïzu.

188
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:41,260
I have been attacked by pirates
while going... to Azuchi.

189
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,870
Water... please!

190
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:11,710
Wherever you go
watch out for the pirates!

191
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,220
They'll take your life...

192
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,940
and your goods...

193
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,060
and especially your women!

194
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,180
Buddha has his soul!

195
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:56,780
Let's go back home.
The danger is too big.

196
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,940
Let put the women ashore.
We will go alone.

197
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,860
I go there, to supervise you.

198
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,940
You will be kidnapped!

199
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,500
I'll take the risk.

200
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,620
Please, take me with you.

201
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,780
Think about our kid.

202
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:20,820
Turn around, Ohama... Faster!

203
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,780
We will come back money.
Before 10 days.

204
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:53,780
May the gods protect you!

205
00:26:54,790 --> 00:27:00,260
Avoid the road,
take the mountain trails.

206
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,430
Stay away of the villages.

207
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,260
These misfortunes won't last.
Patience!

208
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,540
Be  careful all of you!

209
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,380
See you soon!

210
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,710
Take good care of Genitchi!

211
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,780
We will bring back a lot of money!

212
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,190
Dad!

213
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,340
Good luck!..

214
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,820
I will take this vase.

215
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,220
And this sake pot, and these two bowls.

216
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:25,900
These rice bowls and these plates.
And these pots.

217
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:31,180
Rice bowls, plates and pots.

218
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,900
We live in the Manor Kutsuki,
on the mountain.

219
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,260
Deliver them there.

220
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,940
We will pay you then.

221
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,100
Thank you, Madame..
Very well.

222
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,700
The Castle's guard! Make place!

223
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:15,540
I could be a samurai,
with an armor and a spear!

224
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,380
don't waste our money.

225
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,460
Do I look like a samurai?

226
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:14,820
Certainly!
But you need a spear.

227
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,660
You are superb!

228
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,140
Your salary!

229
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,780
Idiot!..

230
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:14,340
You see it, my misfortune..?

231
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:18,580
thanks to you,
your wife is reduced to that!

232
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,700
Be proud to have become a Samurai
at such a price!

233
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,300
Tobeï... Big fool..!

234
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,660
Would you watch over my stall?

235
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,660
My partner is coming back.

236
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,260
How much is it..?

237
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,020
Do you want to buy it?

238
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,700
If the price is right.

239
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,980
It is much too beautiful
for your wife!

240
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,900
But I have the money!

241
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:53,420
We thought
that it was better to guide you.

242
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,870
You are so good!

243
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,100
Follow us!

244
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,900
Move on!

245
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:33,380
Thank you, but I would like...

246
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:37,460
Dame Wakasa wants to
see you.

247
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,660
That is the princess's name?

248
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:46,860
She is the unique daughter
of the late Lord Kutsuki.

249
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,820
Do not fear... Enter!

250
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,500
Comwith me.

251
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:21,980
You are indeed Master Genjuro,
from the province of Ohmi?

252
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,230
How do you know it?

253
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:34,220
At the  market,
when I saw your ceramics...

254
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:37,750
I hardly believed my eyes!

255
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,230
These blue reflections seemed...

256
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:44,540
to be made of mother of pearl!

257
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,820
thanks to the lessons
taught by my father...

258
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,980
I am able to appreciate them.

259
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:59,820
How do you create such beauty!

260
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,900
Do you have a secret?

261
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,460
No special secret.

262
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:14,780
kneading and varnishing
require a certain knack.

263
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:21,540
what you realize
is a pure marvel!

264
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:25,060
Only, a true master craftsman
can create such a beauty!

265
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,140
Thank you, Madam..

266
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:57,220
But... these are my works!

267
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:04,980
I only want to use what you have made

268
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:10,820
What privilege, my dear kids!

269
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:17,140
Although it is only a distraction...

270
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:20,140
I always consider
my creations...

271
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:22,660
as my real children!

272
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:28,620
I am honored
that they are so appreciated...

273
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:34,910
in a such a decor...

274
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:39,420
and caressed
by such beautiful hands!

275
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,340
I am confused.

276
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:46,580
But I fear, by touching them...

277
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:51,980
to tarnish them.

278
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,140
Please drink.

279
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:00,780
Never my potteries
appeared so beautiful to me!

280
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:15,460
I would never have believed that
the decor had so much influence!

281
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:20,460
My children must feel constrained,
in your presence!

282
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:27,020
don't bury your talent
in a small village.

283
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:33,340
Enrich it, more fully
and more deeply.

284
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:39,540
But... how would I
be able to it?

285
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:47,340
By marrying Lady Wakasa!
Don't wait longer...

286
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:59,630
<i>"The most beautiful 
of chosen silks</i>

287
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:09,140
<i>fades... and  destroys itself.</i>

288
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:21,260
<i>"As would my life,
O Beloved ... "</i>

289
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:27,900
<i>"If you had deceived me!"</i>

290
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:30,020
How his voice seems happy!

291
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:36,390
It's my late father's.

292
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:53,620
The entire Katsuki Clan
has been annihilated.

293
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:03,500
Only my mistress, survived
that you see here.

294
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,100
And me, her nurse.

295
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:11,220
The soul of my Lord
remained here...

296
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:14,860
and HE sings...

297
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:18,900
every time that my
Lady dances.

298
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:24,700
This virile voice
it is not magnificent?

299
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:33,540
He is delighted
of my Lady's near marriage!

300
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:49,820
Every time that i hear it, I...

301
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:20,260
It is too early.
Remain in bed, my love!

302
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:22,310
Where am I..?

303
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:31,340
Would you have forgotten..?!

304
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:41,300
The Lord is awake?

305
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:48,260
Lead your beloved husband
to the source.

306
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:54,260
You don't need me
anymore!

307
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,340
You question me!

308
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:25,860
You take myself for a bad Angel,
don't you?

309
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:38,660
Never mind... you are mine!

310
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:50,580
Henceforth, you will obey me in everything ,
and you will be devoted to me!

311
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:52,340
It doesn't matter that you are a demon!

312
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:55,140
I won't leave you anymore!

313
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:02,380
I would never have imagined such pleasures.

314
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:12,340
It is divine!

315
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:15,140
It is the Paradise!

316
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:03,220
Give me something to eat.

317
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:48,300
Take these rice cakes.

318
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:58,420
Escape by the back... On the left!

319
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:00,380
And be very careful!

320
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:30,980
Do you have something to eat?

321
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:33,540
We burst hunger!

322
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:45,790
It is for my kid,
don't take it!..

323
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:44,540
Cut off my head!

324
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:54,340
I decapitated a
hostile general!

325
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,300
You found a valuable head.

326
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:06,270
<i>I didn't find it.</i>

327
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:09,180
I killed the man with my spear!

328
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:16,020
Who will believe that the freat warrior
Fuwa let himself killed by you!

329
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:20,180
However, I will leave you the credit of it.

330
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:21,900
Name your price.

331
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:26,460
A horse, an armor, and men.

332
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:30,100
Well. You will have all of it.

333
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:32,790
Thank you, Lord.

334
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:35,030
Your request pleases me!

335
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:55,220
Famous samurai!

336
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:57,110
Who is that great samurai?

337
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:59,820
He killed Fuwa, the great general!

338
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:01,060
What is his name?

339
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:06,500
Tobeï of Nakanogo,
famous in the Niwa army.

340
01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:22,750
Come to see the pretty girls...

341
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:26,270
that want to amuse you!

342
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:27,420
What do you want..?

343
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:29,540
Master., let's stop here.

344
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:32,790
No, I'm going home!

345
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:36,260
There is someone there
that I want to dazzle!

346
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:38,740
Master.... be generous!

347
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:40,940
For your soldiers!

348
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:43,540
Well, I understand.

349
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:49,540
Tobeï of Nakanogo, of the Niwa army,
is going to take a rest.

350
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:51,700
Prepare rooms!

351
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:32,900
Which is Tobeï?

352
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:40,140
His big deed astonished me.

353
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:48,900
Can i drink in your cup?

354
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:54,060
How did you kill this general?

355
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:59,780
We would like some details,
to imitate you.

356
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,740
It is not much.

357
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:05,700
First, you need brains.

358
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:09,470
Then, physical strength.

359
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:15,580
I mean...
military science.

360
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:17,980
Finally, a broad view.

361
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:22,230
With all that, you will be as
capable as any great strategist!

362
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:25,630
But especially, use your brains!

363
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:33,260
Me, I became a master in strategy...

364
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:36,460
in the handling of the spear...

365
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:41,220
in construction of battlements...

366
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:44,020
and of fortresses!

367
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:58,590
Wait!.. And my money?

368
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:08,660
You are worse than a thief!

369
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:17,870
I never pay the likes of you!

370
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:22,350
Pig! To take advantage of me like that!

371
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:25,060
Well, that's better than nothing!

372
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:29,380
Ohama!..

373
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:37,030
So you are a great man now!

374
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:39,620
Finally became the samurai
of your dreams!

375
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:46,510
Me too, I succeeded.

376
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:50,740
I wear rich kimonos, and make up, I drink...

377
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:55,860
and I lie down!

378
01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:58,900
Great triumph for a woman!

379
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:09,580
You must be happy of it!

380
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:13,780
The one that gets the glory
makes someone endure.

381
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:17,700
My fall is the price
of your ascension!

382
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:24,060
Be my guest tonight.

383
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:27,630
And pay me with the money your deeds won you!

384
01:05:32,310 --> 01:05:37,510
Ohama!.. Without you,
my successes don't mean anything.

385
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:43,460
You lie! You never thought aboutme... Selfish!

386
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:45,750
I did, believe me.

387
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:53,740
I believed that you would admire me.

388
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:00,460
I never thought that you would fall to "that!"

389
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:03,500
I am a lost woman!

390
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:09,180
because of you!

391
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:13,580
Lets go back to our former life

392
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:16,510
Otherwise, I will kill myself!

393
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:19,790
Yes, we will go back to our former life.

394
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,900
How many times did I want to kill myself !

395
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:26,180
But before, I wanted to see you again.

396
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,580
I don't know why.

397
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,510
But I could not kill myself...

398
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:33,740
in spite of all my longing!

399
01:06:57,870 --> 01:07:02,100
Well, this and this...

400
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:06,020
Can you lower your price?

401
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:11,630
If I remove that, yes.

402
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:16,900
No, come with me to the Kutsuki
manor, and I will pay you.

403
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:19,220
Kutsuki..?!

404
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:21,460
Yes, in the mountain.

405
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:32,900
Take everything... but leave!
I don't want your money!

406
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:45,940
Wait!

407
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:47,900
Who... me?

408
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:50,660
You're running towards your misfortune!

409
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:52,300
What misfortune?

410
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:54,900
Let me take a close look at you.

411
01:07:56,510 --> 01:08:01,540
I must talk to you...
Follow me!

412
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:14,860
I see Death upon you.

413
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:20,900
Would you not have met a ghost?

414
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:23,430
Certainly no!

415
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:28,940
Do you have a house, a family?

416
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:37,910
In this case, go back home immediately!

417
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:43,540
You will die, if you remain here.
Leave, and quickly!

418
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:45,750
But why..?

419
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:49,420
because your existence is at stake.

420
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:56,380
I live happy with Wakasa
in the Manor Kutsuki.

421
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:57,940
Wakasa is a shadow!

422
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:04,620
You are engagedd in a forbidden love!

423
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:09,140
didn't you like yours?

424
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:12,660
What will they become without you..?

425
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:17,710
Wait!

426
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:24,580
Go there, if you must.

427
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:29,020
But i can't let you go to your death.

428
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:32,270
I want to protect you!

429
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:42,780
If you see how much this ghost
be horrible, you will be saved!

430
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:16,230
What a charming costume!

431
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:24,940
And these superb necklaces!

432
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:36,420
I am so happy!

433
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:39,900
You are indeed good.

434
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:42,660
What a relief!

435
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:47,660
I worried so much of your delay to go back!

436
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:54,140
But you look dark.

437
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:56,870
What happened?

438
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:01,180
Tell me, what it is.

439
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:08,060
We must not go out anymore

440
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:13,340
Since the fall of our clan,
everyone despises us.

441
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:20,060
People even calumniate us.

442
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:28,900
Genjuro...
I don't want to lose you!

443
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:35,870
Let's go together
to the region where i came from.

444
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:43,740
You, my only love!

445
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:47,380
Do you agree, my beloved?

446
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:50,260
Pardon me!

447
01:11:59,150 --> 01:12:00,820
I lied to you.

448
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:05,350
I have a wife. And a son.

449
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:10,940
I abandonned them them to the horror of war.

450
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:14,260
Forget everything !

451
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:15,260
let me go back.

452
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:18,940
No... Never!

453
01:12:29,390 --> 01:12:32,220
Come with me to the country
which is mine.

454
01:12:39,070 --> 01:12:40,630
What's happening ?

455
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:43,620
Regarde... on his body!

456
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:48,270
Genjuros! You betrayed my love.

457
01:12:55,150 --> 01:12:58,220
Wipe what is written
on your skin!

458
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:10,020
Why Did you married her,
being already married?

459
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:13,820
I don't know what drove me
to that fault.

460
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:18,500
For a man, it is a fault.
But for a woman...

461
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:21,270
Pardon me. And let me go!

462
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:23,500
Certainly not!

463
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:30,740
Wipe this prayer to Buddha!

464
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:33,340
to be forgiven.

465
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:36,220
Genjuro...

466
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:44,270
why such treachery?

467
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:48,390
How did you dare..?

468
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:53,300
I want to remain forever with you.

469
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:57,700
Be my only love... for eternity!

470
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:02,180
Wakasa had left this world...

471
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:06,540
before she could enjoy life.

472
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:11,180
I had mercy of her.

473
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:18,620
I wanted her to know
woman's pleasures...

474
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:22,100
The burning love of youth.

475
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:27,540
I took her out of her grave
and brought her back on earth.

476
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:34,340
And we found in you the man...

477
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:39,460
that she married by love.

478
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:45,300
Now, enjoys life.

479
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:48,100
If you leave her...

480
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:52,580
her happiness will be forever ended.

481
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:55,790
Won't your heart be crushed...

482
01:14:56,230 --> 01:15:02,420
At the thought of destroying
her only source of joy?

483
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:05,790
Imagine your remorse, then!

484
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:11,900
Have mercy of Wakasa!

485
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:17,860
And renounce your idea.

486
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:21,580
You must forgive me!..

487
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:29,580
Up, dirty thief!

488
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:39,540
You stole the Treasure
of the Temple of Yatsuo.

489
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:42,980
You are mistaken! It is mine.

490
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:46,580
This sacred treasure disappeared
a month ago.

491
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:50,180
Absurd! It belongs to the Kutsuki manor.

492
01:16:50,550 --> 01:16:52,190
What... Kutsuki?

493
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:59,380
You dream!.. Here are the ruins
of the old Kutsuki manor.

494
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:01,100
Enough idiocies!

495
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:03,900
Where did you find this?

496
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:06,300
Search him!

497
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:13,220
It is my money!

498
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:19,140
We would throw you in jail,
if it was not burnt.

499
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:21,620
Be thankful.

500
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:14,980
<i>"The most beautiful 
of chosen silks"</i>

501
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:21,190
<i> fades... and destroys itself".</i>

502
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:34,140
<i> "As would my life, O Beloved... "</i>

503
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:39,780
<i> "If you had deceived me... "</i>

504
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:30,780
Miyagi!

505
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:34,020
Miyagi!

506
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:05,940
How worried you must have been!

507
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:11,980
I am so happy to see you in good health.

508
01:20:17,190 --> 01:20:18,340
And our son?

509
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:25,300
He sleeps.

510
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:30,940
Kid, I came back!

511
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:35,380
Dad came back home!

512
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:43,620
I wanted to bring
something better.

513
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:49,910
But I was not able to.
I have... acted like a fool.

514
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:55,020
don't tell me more!
You are here, safe and sound.

515
01:20:58,670 --> 01:21:03,460
When awakening...
my mind was upset.

516
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:07,230
don't continue.

517
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:13,740
You really must be tired.
I give you sake.

518
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:32,820
And here something to eat.

519
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:21,750
I am so happy!

520
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:26,870
The sake is better than ever.

521
01:22:31,670 --> 01:22:33,100
What peace!

522
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:42,100
Son, I hand you in bed.

523
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:56,140
Not one instant of peace,
since my departure.

524
01:22:56,630 --> 01:23:03,180
But I'm home... Finally!

525
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:28,580
Who's in there..?
Open the door!

526
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:41,300
The chief of the village!

527
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:43,620
Genjuro! You came back!

528
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:47,110
Thank you for all your goodness
whhile i was away.

529
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:52,300
Here you are kid!

530
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:55,150
I looked everywhere for you.

531
01:27:02,110 --> 01:27:04,260
The kid must have heard about your return.

532
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:07,060
Miyagi!..

533
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:14,740
Genjuro... Are you dreaming?

534
01:27:17,550 --> 01:27:20,300
Your wife... has been killed.

535
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:23,740
Killed..?

536
01:27:25,590 --> 01:27:32,350
Yes. Poor soul, she would have been
so happy to see you back.

537
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:50,300
Since her death,
I kept your child at home.

538
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:54,550
I was so aafraid,
when he disappeared!

539
01:27:58,030 --> 01:28:00,670
The voice of blood, it is marvelous!

540
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:05,060
How could he know that you were here!

541
01:28:31,630 --> 01:28:36,750
You didn't understand your madness
until meeting your misfortune.

542
01:28:37,230 --> 01:28:40,820
The war ruined all our hopes.

543
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:44,830
Let my sacrifice not be vain.

544
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:47,620
Be brave!..

545
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:10,380
Why did you die?

546
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:35,260
<i>I didn't die, my beloved.</i>

547
01:29:36,150 --> 01:29:38,820
<i>I am close to you.</i>

548
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:47,300
<i>Your long road is to its end.</i>

549
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:50,140
<i>Come back to your place.</i>

550
01:29:51,470 --> 01:29:54,220
<i>Take back your work...</i>

551
01:30:06,110 --> 01:30:09,460
<i>It is so pretty!</i>

552
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:15,660
<i>Helping you is my greatest pleasure.</i>

553
01:30:19,550 --> 01:30:22,140
<i>I can't wait to see them finished.</i>

554
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:26,180
<i>The logs are ready.</i>

555
01:30:27,310 --> 01:30:30,270
<i>Pillagers won't come anymore</i>

556
01:30:32,590 --> 01:30:34,980
<i>Spin your potteries in peace.</i>

557
01:30:40,670 --> 01:30:43,140
<i>A lot of things happened.</i>

558
01:30:45,910 --> 01:30:50,860
<i>But you became
The man of my ideal.</i>

559
01:30:52,190 --> 01:30:59,820
<i>Alas, I am not anymore 
in the same world than yours.</i>

560
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:05,580
<i>We must resign...</i>

561
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:28,830
You must be tired. Rest.

562
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:42,380
Kid, eat while it's hot.

563
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:45,420
You too, my brother!..
