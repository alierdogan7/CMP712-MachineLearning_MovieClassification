<font color="#ffff00">STUART HERRINGTON</font>: As we began
to contemplate evacuation,

3
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,500
the question,
the burning question was,

4
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,210
"Who goes,

5
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,090
and who gets left behind?"

6
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,640
I borrowed a truck

7
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,730
and I basically sent
the signal to my folks,

8
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,860
and this meant a group
of South Vietnamese majors,

9
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,030
lieutenant colonels, colonels
and their families

10
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,990
to muster at an address
in downtown Saigon.

11
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:15,080
I drove down there,
they loaded up onto the truck,

12
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,080
and I drove them to the airbase.

13
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,260
And I had told them,
"When you hear three thumps,

14
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,880
"that means
hold the babies' mouths.

15
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,550
"Don't breathe, don't talk,
don't make any noise

16
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,970
because we're going through
the gatepost."

17
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,220
I saluted in uniform

18
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,890
as a captain
of the United States Army.

19
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,560
The guard waved me through,

20
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,910
and I drove straight out
to the flight line

21
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,780
to an aircraft
that was awaiting.

22
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,080
One Vietnamese colonel that was
putting his family on the plane,

23
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,120
he had wanted to stay in Vietnam
to defend the country.

24
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,330
And this full colonel had,
like, eight kids and a wife.

25
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,680
And he was in tears,
the family...

26
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,010
The family were in tears,

27
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,930
and I said to him,
"Get on the plane.

28
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,640
"Just... go.

29
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,640
Go."

30
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,480
It was a terrible,
terrible, terrible moral dilemma

31
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,160
for everybody.

32
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,370
We today have concluded
an agreement to end the war

33
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,800
and bring peace with honor
in Vietnam.

34
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,850
<font color="#ffff00">NIXON</font>: We have adopted a plan
for the complete withdrawal

35
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,560
of all U.S. combat
ground forces.

36
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,860
We are finally bringing
American men home.

37
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,940
<font color="#ffff00">HENRY KISSINGER</font>:
We who made the agreement

38
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,360
thought that it would be
the beginning

39
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,360
not of peace
in the American sense,

40
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,620
but the beginning of a period
of coexistence

41
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,870
which might evolve as it did
in Korea into two states.

42
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,670
Reconciliation between
North and South Vietnam

43
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,550
we knew would be
extremely difficult.

44
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,520
But I was hopeful.

45
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,220
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>:
Because of the Paris Agreement,

46
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,980
American soldiers
were going home.

47
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,190
But I was on my way back
to Vietnam.

48
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,990
I was assigned to Saigon

49
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,950
in the first week
of August 1973,

50
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,290
so about six months
after the ceasefire.

51
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,260
I would say that between
the State Department people

52
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,380
and CIA people,

53
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,260
the contractors who were there
to maintain infrastructure,

54
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,510
maintain aircraft,

55
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,260
as well as people like me,

56
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,610
we had 5,000 to 7,000 Americans
in country.

57
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,060
A lot of the guys had Vietnamese
girlfriends and wives,

58
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,780
in many cases with children.

59
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,410
In general,
things were eerily calm

60
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,120
and in many ways normal
in Saigon.

61
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,620
My sense was that
we were gonna be there,

62
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,800
you know, pretty much
for a long time to come.

63
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:54,090
I was assigned to the
American embassy in Saigon.

64
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,880
I was in charge

65
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,260
of the 84 Marine security guards
that were there,

66
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,060
making sure that they kept up

67
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,530
with their physical fitness
training.

68
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,020
We were there to protect
American lives

69
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,480
as well as American property.

70
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,360
It was just a day-to-day job.

71
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,950
<font color="#ffff00">FRANK SNEPP</font>: The Ambassador there
was a guy named Graham Martin,

72
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,500
a North Carolinian,
just as I was.

73
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,330
He spoke with a slow
Southern drawl.

74
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,930
He was a great gentleman.

75
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,500
He was a cold warrior
in the old stripe.

76
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,920
He'd lost an adopted son
in Vietnam to combat.

77
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,930
And he was not gonna give up
South Vietnam to the Communists.

78
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,930
He was determined
to keep U.S. aid

79
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,780
flowing into Saigon.

80
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,980
When the ceasefire occurred
in 1973,

81
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,030
everybody toasted it
with Bloody Marys

82
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,860
in the U.S. embassy.

83
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,990
It was a grand party.

84
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,410
We thought peace was at hand.

85
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:09,540
But the Paris Peace Accord
was a masterpiece of ambiguity.

<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>: In order to get President
Thieu and the South Vietnamese

88
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,060
President Nixon
pulled out all the stops,

89
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,640
and in a letter
to President Thieu,

90
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,310
he promised that
if the North Vietnamese

91
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,350
were to substantially violate

92
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,400
the terms
of the Paris Agreement,

93
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,980
the United States would respond
with full force.

94
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:37,360
In other words, reenter the war.

95
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,990
<font color="#ffff00">SNEPP</font>: The North Vietnamese
viewed Nixon as a madman.

96
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,910
They were terrified of him.

97
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,580
They believed that Nixon,
if necessary,

98
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,670
would bring back
American air power.

99
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,800
But in August 1974, he was gone.

100
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,090
Nixon resigned
because of Watergate.

101
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,470
And overnight,
everything changed.

102
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:12,310
Hanoi suddenly saw the road
to Saigon as being open.

The South Vietnamese population

109
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,010
had ample reason to fear
the Vietnamese Communists.

110
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,730
The Communist conduct
throughout the course of the war

111
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,150
had been violent
and unforgiving.

112
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,150
For example,
when the city of Hue

113
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,440
was taken over
by the North Vietnamese,

114
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,200
several thousand people
on a long blacklist

115
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,530
were rounded up...

116
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,910
School teachers,
government civil servants,

117
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,080
people who were known
anti-Communists...

118
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,910
And they were executed,

119
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,910
in some cases even buried alive.

from the coastal city's
crowded backstreets and pagodas

131
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,430

grabbing at the air stair.

We're pulling them on
as fast as we can.

00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,570
There's a sea of humanity
jamming on.

It was every man for himself.

So you saw
the World Airways flight

00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:50,680
being mobbed
by South Vietnamese soldiers.

149
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,430
You saw ships
with thousands of refugees,

150

including lots of soldiers.

151
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,600
You saw out-of-control panic.

152
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,610
Basically
any boats, trucks, airplanes,

153
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,990
or anything going south

154
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,290
were besieged by people
wanting to get onboard.

155
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,000
<font color="#ffff00">SNEPP</font>: The Americans were gone,

156
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,590
and as a result, the house
of cards began to collapse.

157
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:31,090
The North Vietnamese
decided to escalate,

158
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,010
escalate, escalate, escalate
at every turn

159
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,110
to see if the United States
would react.

160
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:46,020
<font color="#ffff00">RON NESSEN</font>: In April of '75, I

162
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,360
when one of the airplane's crew

163
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,620
comes and hands me a note,

164
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,990
and it says,
"Da Nang has fallen."

165
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,080
Ford was bombarded
by questions from the press

166
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,580
after he got off Air Force One.

167
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,340
Around 150,000 to 175,000

We have objected
to that violation.

172
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:26,230
It's a tragedy unbelievable
in its ramifications.

173
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:31,530
<font color="#ffff00">SNEPP</font>: We are now in a crisis.

174
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,530
We had a wave of humanity:

175
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:41,080
500,000 refugees rolling,
rolling south towards Saigon,

176
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:47,800
and 160,000 North Vietnamese
troops moving right behind them.

177
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,130
I had become so concerned,

178
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,810
I decided to pull
our best Vietnamese agents in

179
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,470
out of the woodwork

180
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,060
to try to see
what they could tell us

181
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,980
about Communist planning, which
obviously was rapidly evolving.

182
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,980
On the 8th of April,

183
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,070
I met with one of our
best agents,

184
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,570
who said, "The Communists
are gonna drive on Saigon."

185
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,040
They're gonna be in there
by Ho Chi Minh's birthday,"

186
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,160
which was May 19th,
literally a month away.

187
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,420
Communist forces
in South Vietnam,

188
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,260
already solidly in control
of 11 provinces,

189
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,670
began working on yet
another one today: Binh Dinh.

190
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,630
<font color="#80FF00">(EXPLOSIONS)</font>

191
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,930
<font color="#80FF00">(GUNFIRE)</font>

192
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,850
KIEM DO:

193
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,890
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>:
I kept a map every day

194
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,890
on the progress of the North
Vietnamese onslaught.

195
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,930
By the 5th of April,

196
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,680
the North Vietnamese had 15,
even 16 divisions

197
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,730
heading in the direction
of Saigon.

198
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,900
They were bringing
SA-2 missiles down

199
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,820
to provide anti-aircraft cover
for their forces.

200
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,320
There were people
who were saying,

201
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,870
"Look, we've gotta do
some heavy, heavy planning here

202
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,540
"because depending
on how this goes,

203
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,000
and it doesn't look good now,
we may all have to evacuate."

204
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,500
And Ambassador Martin

205
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,840
wouldn't tolerate or countenance
such thought.

206
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,290
That was defeatism.

207
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,290
That was poisonous
to the prospects

208
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,840
of the people
we're here to help.

209
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:02,180
But people could see
what was going on

210
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,520
and they started leaving,
especially the Americans.

211
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,820
I'm leaving Vietnam.

212
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,850
Why?

213
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,570
I'm kind of scared,
to be honest with you.

214
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,440
To be perfectly honest with you,
I'm really scared.

215
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,540
I think the situation's
a lot worse than we know about.

216
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,370
<i><font color="#ffff00">SNEPP</font>: There was always a standing
evacuation plan in the embassy.</i>

217
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,740
It held that in an emergency,

218
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,200
all Americans
still in the country,

219
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:32,790
about 6,000 people,
would be evacuated

220
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:39,050
and that no South Vietnamese
would be evacuated with them.

221
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,930
<font color="#ffff00">BINH PHO</font>: I was a student.

222
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,680
The school's not closing,

223
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,900
but it seemed like nobody's
interested in school anymore.

224
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,140
You can't stay here.

225
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,070
You can't live
with the Communists,

226
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,360
especially if you have
a connection with the Americans.

227
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,080
Then you really gotta get out.

228
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,050
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>: If we really made up a
list of endangered South Vietnamese,

229
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:14,670
the ones who really worked
closely with us during the war,

230
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,800
this number could be
150,000, 200,000.

231
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,340
Including their families,
many more than that.

232
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,690
But the idea
of talking about an evacuation

233
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,560
and of planning
for an evacuation of Americans,

234
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,310
let alone an evacuation
of Vietnamese,

235
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:35,520
was still anathema
in the embassy.

236
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,900
If you mean, "Is South Vietnam"

237
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,280
on the imminent verge
of collapse?"

238
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,360
I think the answer
is quite definitely no.

239
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,620
<font color="#ffff00">STEVE HASTY</font>: We were
dealing with an ambassador

240
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,620
who was just convinced
that somehow,

241
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,540
he was going to be able
to pull this out

242
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,290
and that there wouldn't have
to be an evacuation

243
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,390
and therefore, there wouldn't
have to be a concern

244
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,930
about evacuating
South Vietnamese.

245
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:11,060
<font color="#ffff00">GERALD FORD</font>: The situation in South
Vietnam has reached a critical phase

246
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,520
requiring immediate and positive
decisions by this government.

247
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,360
There are tens of thousands

248
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,490
of South Vietnamese employees
of the United States government,

249
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,110
of news agencies,

250
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:30,160
of contractors and businesses
for many years

251
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,870
whose lives,
with their dependents,

252
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,500
are in very grave peril.

253
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,550
I'm therefore
asking the Congress

254
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:47,180
to appropriate without delay
$722 million

255
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,760
for emergency military
assistance for South Vietnam.

256
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,520
If the very worst
were to happen,

257
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,480
at least allow the orderly
evacuation of Americans

258
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,570
and endangered South Vietnamese
to places of safety.

259
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,370
There was no way in 1975

260
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,500
that the Congress
was going to vote any money

261
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,540
to go to the aid
of South Vietnam.

262
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,540
We had pulled out our troops
in 1973

263
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,420
and public opinion
at that point shifted.

264
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,510
The people of the United States,
having seen Watergate,

265
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,590
having seen the deception
of the generals,

266
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:34,220
weren't about to give any help
in Southeast Asia.

267
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,730
And you know,
Kissinger knew this.

268
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,400
We knew we were not going to get
the $722 million.

269
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,480
By that time
it made no big difference,

270
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,900
but President Ford said

271
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,820
he owed it to Vietnam
to make a request.

272
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,790
We've sent, so to speak,
battleship after battleship

273
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,750
and bomber after bomber
and 500,000 and more men

274
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,420
and billions and billions
of dollars.

275
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,300
If billions and billions
didn't do

276
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,090
at a time when we had
all our men there,

277
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,100
how can $722 million
save the day?

278
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,100
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>: This is the way
my map looked in mid-April.

279
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,110
The North Vietnamese
just rolled down the coast.

280
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,860
Saigon was clearly threatened.

281
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,700
The situation was urgent.

282
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,990
Urgent understates it.

283
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,290
<font color="#ffff00">SNEPP</font>: At this time, Ambassador
Martin had been back in Washington

284
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,960
trying to persuade Congress

285
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,130
<font color="#ffff00">REPORTER</font>: Do you have anything
to say on your arrival?

286

He has no statement to make.

287
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,880
<font color="#ffff00">SNEPP</font>: He came back to Saigon,

288
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,010
and my boss,
the CIA station chief, said,

289
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,480
"Go down and tell the old man
what's happening."

290
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,820
I went and I said,
"Mr. Ambassador,

291
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,940
"half of the South Vietnamese
Army has disintegrated.

292
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,100
"We're in grave trouble.

293
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,770
"Please, sir,
plan for an evacuation.

294
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,610
"At least allow us
to begin putting together

295
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,330
lists of South Vietnamese
we should rescue."

296
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:15,870
<i>And he saw, "No, Frank.</i>

297
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,330
"It's not so bleak.

298
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:23,210
And I won't have
this negative talk."

299
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,340
Young officers in the embassy

300
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,510
began to mobilize
a black operation,

301
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:36,430
meaning a makeshift
underground railway evacuation

302
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,470
using outgoing cargo aircraft

303
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:44,690
that would be totally below
the radar of the Ambassador.

304
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,820
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>:
People like myself and others

305
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,940
took the bull by the horns
and organized an evacuation.

306
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,820
In my case,
that meant friends of mine

307
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,870
who were senior officers in
the South Vietnamese military.

308
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:03,000
As the North Vietnamese came
closer and closer to Saigon,

309
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,970
these people
were dead men walking.

310
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,050
I had arranged a signal

311
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,890
with my intelligence
community friends

312
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,100
that if I said,
"I'm having a barbecue,"

313
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,770
that meant come to a certain
pre-designated place

314
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,230
and bring your families
and only bring one suitcase

315
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,390
because we're going
to have a party.

316
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,390
But it was understood
the party meant

317
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,020
I was going to get them out.

318
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:32,900
Black Ops were essentially
violating the rules...

319
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,780
In this case meaning,

320
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,000
you're not allowed to bring out
Vietnamese military people

321
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,290
who were under obligation
to stand and fight.

322
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,500
We were fully expecting
if we got caught doing this

323
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,220
that we would be run
out of country.

324
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,250
End of career, do not pass go.

325
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:54,630
But sometimes there's an issue
not of legal and illegal,

326
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,510
but right or wrong.

327
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,560
<font color="#ffff00">SNEPP</font>: The deputy defense attaché
moved out Vietnamese personnel

328
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,520
and their families to Clark Air
Base in the Philippines

329
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,240
without any approval whatsoever,

330
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,200
without any immigration papers,
anything...

331
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,780
Passports, you name it.

332
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,530
And when they began showing up
in the Philippines,

333
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,950
Martin hit the roof
and fired him!

334
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:23,660
But that didn't stop
other State Department people

335
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,370
who had Vietnamese friends
and family members.

336
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,100
They continued to organize
these makeshift airlifts.

337
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,980
TERRY McNAMARA:
That April, I was in Can Tho,

338
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,190
which was about 100 miles
from Saigon.

339
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,900
And we were getting reports

340
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,490
of this town falling and
that province falling and so on.

341
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,450
And then we were attacked.

342
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:03,620
Sergeant Hasty came by to
give me a report on the damage.

343
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,620
Can Tho came under pretty
intense artillery bombardment.

344
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,500
The North Vietnamese had overrun

345
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,000
some South Vietnamese
artillery batteries

346
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:20,180
and managed to turn those around
and shell the center of Can Tho.

347
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,570
<font color="#ffff00">TERRY MCNAMARA</font>: I was in regular
contact with the embassy,

348
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,310
and I was told that
when the time came,

349
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,810
I should be ready to evacuate,

350
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,110
and that I should not try
to take any Vietnamese out

351
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,110
because it was too dangerous,

352
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,990
and I should only
restrict myself

353
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:45,080
to evacuating Americans
using my three helicopters.

354
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,500
Well, I'd been there for almost
five years at this point,

355
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,290
and I was committed
to the Vietnamese.

356
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,800
I did have a responsibility,
I thought,

357
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,720
for the people
who had worked for us

358
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,510
and who had given their loyal
service to us over many years.

359
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,220
So I decided that
despite the order from Saigon,

360
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,400
we're gonna really
make an effort

361
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,270
to evacuate the people
in Can Tho

362
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,690
who I thought might be
in mortal danger.

363
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,400
This could be hundreds
of people.

364
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,200
So I spent one sleepless night
worrying about this.

365
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,700
"How am I going to do this?"

366
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,870
And then I thought,
"Hell, we're on a river.

367
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,700
"We don't need helicopters.

368
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,250
We can go down the river."

369
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,170
It's 70 miles from Can Tho
down to the mouth of the river.

370
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:46,270
So I found two invasion barges
and got them ready to go.

371
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,270
We knew that
the situation was bad.

372
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:59,020
We could see that the South
Vietnamese Army was eroding.

373
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,440
Supplies had been cutoff

374
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,660
and you could see
the armaments dwindling.

375
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,670
<font color="#ffff00">MCNAMARA</font>: We were, under the
terms of the Paris Agreement,

376
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:16,630
committed to resupplying
the South Vietnamese.

377
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,550
They lacked simple things,
like barbed wire

378
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,800
and bags for sand bags.

379
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,090
<font color="#80FF00">(ARTILLERY FIRE)</font>

380
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:27,680
They were rationing
their artillery shells

381
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,310
because they were running out.

382
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,600
The military support,
the material support,

383
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,640
was not coming.

384
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,650
<font color="#ffff00">HENRY KISSINGER</font>: When President
Ford went before the Congress,

385
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:44,820
he had two major concerns.

386
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:51,740
The first was to save
as many people as we could.

387
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,340
He cared for the human beings
involved;

388
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,420
They were not just pawns

389
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:01,250
that once they had lost their
military power were abandoned.

390
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:06,380
The second was the honor
of America,

391
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:12,890
that we would not be seen at
the final agony of South Vietnam

392
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,490
as having stabbed it
in the back.

393
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:24,150
<font color="#ffff00">RON NESSEN</font>:
Congress wouldn't pass it.

394
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,570
They said, "No more."

395
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:31,700
No more troops, no more money,
no more aid to the Vietnamese."

396
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:39,630
Well, I had to go into President
Ford's office to tell him.

397
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:42,880
I had never heard Ford
use a curse word

398
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,760
in all the time I'd known him.

399
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,260
But when I showed him
this story, he said,

400
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,140
"Those sons of bitches."

401
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,910
I think there were a total
of 50 ships that were there.

402
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,910
I mean, it wasn’t just us;
It was a whole bunch of ships.

403
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:18,460
We were standing by
for the evacuation of Americans.

404
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,920
I was a terrible letter writer.

405
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,510
I would write one letter
for my wife's ten letters,

406
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,220
and she didn't like that,
so she said,

407
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,140
"We're going to exchange tapes."

408
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,220
So I would run
into my stateroom,

409
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,310
turn the tape recorder on
for a couple of minutes

410
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,680
and tell her what's happening.

411
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,980
DOYLE <i><font color="#80FF00">(ON TAPE)</font>: I really
don‘t know where to start.</i>

412
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,810
<i>It's been such an unusual
couple days for us.</i>

413
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:46,780
<i>We went with the rest
of this huge task force of ours</i>

414
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:51,070
<i>up into about, oh,
20 miles off the coast,</i>

415
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,420
<i>basically east of Saigon.</i>

416
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:01,620
As most Navy operations are,
it was very carefully planned.

417
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,300
We planned it to death.

418
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,380
The chain of command,
as I understood it

419
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,810
as a captain of the United
States Marine Corps,

420
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:14,720
and I think I got it right,

421
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,100
is that for any evacuation,

422
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,600
that decision
is the Ambassador's decision.

423
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:25,480
Graham Martin
is the responsible guy.

424
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,150
But the military is responsible

425
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,780
forgiving him
all kinds of plans.

426
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,740
And this is how we got
into the four options.

427
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,740
The first option was

428
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,960
you would take commercial ships
right up the Saigon River

429
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,370
to a couple blocks
from the embassy.

430
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,870
You would load
whoever you wanted

431
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:49,090
to bring out on these ships
and you'd be done with it.

432
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,840
The second option was, you know,

433
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,930
United and Continental
and Flying Tiger Airlines

434
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,680
were still using Tan Son Nhut
Air Force Base at the time,

435
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,980
and you could've brought
anybody you wanted out

436
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:03,850
by commercial aviation.

437
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,610
The third option was military
fixed-wing aviation...

438
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:10,190
The C5As, the C-141s,
which carry a lot of people.

439
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,040
You could've brought them
out of Tan Son Nhut on those.

440
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,870
The very last option,
the very last option,

441
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,710
was helicopters off the carriers

442
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,880
in the Tan Son Nhut
Air Force Base.

443
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,540
We had 75 Marine Corps
helicopters out there.

444
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,920
The helicopter option,

445
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,800
that was absolutely
the last resort.

446
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,340
You know,
they don't go very fast,

447
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,260
they don't carry
that many people.

448
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,100
That was if everything else
failed.

449
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:51,400
<font color="#ffff00">RICHARD ARMITAGE</font>: I got into Vietnam
late on the 24th of April, 1975.

450
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,950
Saigon was full of rumor,
of false stories,

451
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,540
whether we were going to have
a last attempt

452
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,450
to draw a line
across the country,

453
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,250
that Saigon and the south
would remain a free republic,

454
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,460
all of these things,

455
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,000
and it was all churning
all around.

456
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,960
The fighting was close to Saigon

457
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,510
but hadn't shown up
in the streets of Saigon.

458
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,720
I served as a naval officer

459
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,260
in three and a half tours
in Vietnam,

460
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,730
two of those years
as a Special Forces advisor

461
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:28,270
with a 20-boat River Division,
all Vietnamese.

462
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:32,020
I could tell jokes
and hear jokes in Vietnamese.

463
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,900
And once you start off
like that,

464
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:39,030
you eventually end up being able
to dream in Vietnamese.

465
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:43,950
In 1975, my mission was
to remove or destroy

466
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,290
as many ships, swift boats,

467
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:50,420
anything that I considered
to be a benefit to the enemy.

468
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,300
I met with Captain Do Kiem,

469
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,800
who was the operations officer
of the Vietnamese Navy.

470
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,230
<font color="#ffff00">ARMITAGE</font>: The plan was to sail

471
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,330
all the large ships
of the South Vietnamese Navy

472
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,620
down the Saigon River to the sea

473
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,700
and rendezvous
at Con Son Island.

474
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,750
We had to keep this secret.

475
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,340
If word got out,
it would have had an effect

476
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,050
on the morale of the people
in the street.

477
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:45,180
<font color="#ffff00">JOE MCBRIDE</font>: We knew that there
were roughly 5,000 Americans

478
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,060
still in the country.

479
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:52,350
Many of them had Vietnamese
wives, mistresses, whatever.

480
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,690
Just hadn't left.

481
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,820
And they were basically
letting us know,

482
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,490
"We're not leaving
without our families."

483
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:05,200
Finally, we were given authority
by the Ambassador

484
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,870
to bypass the immigration laws

485
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,550
and send these Vietnamese
out of the country.

486
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,300
So then we started an operation

487
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:20,260
basically to get out
the Americans

488
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,100
and their Vietnamese dependents.

489
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,860
<font color="#ffff00">SNEPP</font>: It was not an
official evacuation.

490
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,400
We still had no organized plan

491
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,690
for evacuating high-risk
South Vietnamese

492
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,240
because we had an ambassador

493
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,070
who was making up his mind
on the wing.

494
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,410
<font color="#ffff00">GARRICK UTLEY</font>: The President
also asked Congress

495
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,330
for authorization to use
American troops here

496
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,660
to evacuate Americans

497
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,250
and Vietnamese
who worked for Americans.

498
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,790
If it were necessary.

499
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,380
Do you have plans for that?

500
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,210
Well, of course, every embassy
in the world has plans for it.

501
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,930
Do you think
it will be necessary?

502
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:59,210
That again, you see,
is a judgment

503
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:04,090
that I can’t possibly make
at this time.

504
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:07,100
We have been reducing
the population here

505
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,260
as measure of prudency

506
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,310
and will take measures
to reduce it further

507
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:14,560
as a question of prudence.

508
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,900
The Ambassador
was extremely skittish,

509
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,870
and I guess understandably so,
about talking about evacuation,

510
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,160
about sending signals
that an evacuation

511
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,160
was being planned
or even executed.

512
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,790
He feared it would trigger
a panic.

513
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,130
<font color="#ffff00">BINH PHO</font>: It time to get out.

514
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:42,260
And in Saigon at that time,
it was like, "Who do you know?"

515
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,100
The the key word
would be "connection."

516
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,140
There's a lot of people,
they try to get their money

517
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,600
because if the people
have money,

518
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,650
maybe they will find
a connection to get out.

519
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,310
You know, and so,
"You want to go?

520
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,160
Give me this kind of money."

521
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,150
One guy said to me,

522
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,410
"Your family, tell them
to come to the boat dock.

523
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,530
I'll be waiting for them."

524
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:12,500
Of course they took the money,
but they never got us.

525
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:19,830
<font color="#ffff00">DAM PHAM</font>: There was chaos
in Saigon at that time.

526
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:25,670
Everybody was looking for ways
to get out as soon as possible.

527
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,220
Of course, the Americans
we worked with

528
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,890
had a plan in place for us.

529
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:37,230
They told us to get
to the meeting place,

530
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:44,650
which was a safe house
near the American embassy,

531
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:48,530
and to wait for buses
to come to pick us up.

532
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,380
If we were gonna get people out,

533
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,000
we were gonna have
to make it happen

534
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,050
and deliver the Vietnamese
to the big airplanes

535
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:07,800
in some form or fashion.

536
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,640
And the only way
we could do that

537
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,190
was keeping the airport open
as long as we could.

538
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:33,410
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>: Ambassador Martin
still hoped that somehow,

539
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:37,330
this thing would not end
with the North Vietnamese

540
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:42,580
humiliating the United States
by attacking Saigon.

541
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:47,510
But it seemed like the North
Vietnamese had other ideas.

542
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,310
<font color="#80FF00">(EXPLOSIONS)</font>

543
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:02,730
<font color="#80FF00">(EXPLOSIONS)</font>

544
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:13,120
What may be the final battle
of Saigon has begun.

545
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,990
Communist ground forces
have started moving in

546
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,210
on Saigon's
Tan Son Nhut Airport.

547
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,830
<font color="#ffff00">REPORTER</font>: Rockets exploded
all over the base,

548
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,800
touching off three major fires.

549
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,840
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>: The air base was
under continuous artillery fire.

550
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
I felt the rounds.

551
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,470
They were so close,

552
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,970
the shrapnel was plinking
against the fence behind us.

553
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:41,520
It was abundantly clear that
it was a whole new ball game.

554
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,780
<font color="#ffff00">JUAN VALDEZ</font>: We never expected
any trouble out there.

555
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:55,120
And then, of course,
fear a little bit set in

556
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,340
because now we knew that it
really meant business, you know?

557
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:02,000
Were they gonna continue
shelling Tan Son Nhut?

558
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,960
They had given us a warning,
you know?

559
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,680
"Get out."

560
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,300
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>: As the sun
came up, General Smith,

561
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,390
who was our defense attaché
out at Tan Son Nhut,

562
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,520
contacted the Ambassador
and said,

563
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,190
"The plan to use the fixed-wing

564
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,810
"to get a few thousand people
out today

565
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:25,020
"isn't gonna work.

566
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,860
"And we need to consider
that this is it.

567
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,190
"Option 4:

568
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:33,820
A heavy-lift
helicopter evacuation."

569
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:38,580
And Ambassador Martin
wouldn’t hear of it.

570
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,200
He said,
"l want to come out there.

571
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,130
I want to see it,"
and which he did.

572
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,040
He got in a sedan.

573
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,790
He didn't lack for guts.

574
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:49,500
There were still rounds
coming in...

575
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,050
Sporadic, but there was still
artillery fire.

576
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:57,680
And he could see that
the main runway

577
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,600
was full of craters
from North Vietnamese artillery.

578
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,560
And it was understood
that General Smith

579
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,070
was not being premature with the
recommendation for Option 4.

580
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:16,240
<font color="#ffff00">MCBRIDE</font>: Ambassador Martin's
concern very clearly up to now

581
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,910
was that once we started
an official evacuation,

582
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:25,410
it's pretty obvious that
the game is over.

583
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,590
You've got to remember,
this is an ambassador

584
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:32,920
who had lost his only son
in combat in Vietnam.

585
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,220
One becomes pretty invested
in that country.

586
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:40,050
He had been holding out hope

587
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:44,770
that some kind of third-party
solution could be worked out

588
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:48,100
so that South Vietnam
could continue

589
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:52,730
with some form of independence
or autonomy.

590
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,110
And he was being encouraged

591
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:58,740
to think that
this might be possible.

592
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,320
But the morning of the 29th,

593
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:06,050
he came to accept the fact that
that wasn’t going to happen.

594
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,170
And I picked up the phone

595
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:16,970
and told Secretary Kissinger
to inform the President

596
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:20,390
that I had decided we would have
to go to Option 4.

597
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:27,190
<font color="#ffff00">HENRY KISSINGER</font>: When I tell President
Ford the airport is being shelled

598
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:31,310
and that it's now time
to pull the plug,

599
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:34,480
he keeps coming back
time and again,

600
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,990
"You really think
we have to do it?"

601
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,990
That's how heartbreaking
it was for him.

602
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:49,500
He finally reluctantly
gave the go-ahead

603
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,880
for the final evacuation.

604
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:59,510
<font color="#ffff00">RADIO DJ</font>: This is the American
Forces Vietnam Network.

605
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:03,510
<font color="#ffff00">SNEPP</font>: The prearranged
signal for the evacuation

606
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:06,930
was broadcast on American radio
in Saigon.

607
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,890
The message was,

608
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:12,270
"The temperature
is 105 and rising,"

609
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:16,940
and then Bing Crosby's
"White Christmas.“"

610
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,450
And sure enough,
about 10:00 in the morning,

611
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,070
I believe, on the 29th,

612
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:28,040
there was Bing Crosby
on the airwaves.

613
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:36,040
CROSBY: ♪ I'm dreaming
of a white Christmas ♪

614
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:42,380
♪ Just like the ones
I used to know ♪

615
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:52,640
♪ Where the treetops glisten
and children listen ♪

616
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:06,400
♪ To hear sleigh bells
in the snow... ♪

617
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:10,790
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>: The plan was
when the signal was given,

618
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:14,080
Americans still in Saigon

619
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,800
would immediately go
to pick-up zones around the city

620
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,090
so that buses could then come
to these 13 locations

621
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:23,590
and get everybody
out to the airbase,

622
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:27,680
where they would be helicoptered
to the fleet.

623
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,430
We had prepared
three or four landing zones

624
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,430
right across the street
from the main runway

625
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,560
of Tan Son Nhut airbase...

626
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,520
Areas which had not been
under artillery fire,

627
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:43,320
where heavy lift helicopters
could come in.

628
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,660
It was a good plan,

629
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,700
they had good facilities,
they had good security.

630
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,000
Now that Option 4
had been declared,

631
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,540
I don't think anyone said,

632
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:58,420
"Okay, we have 7,000,
6,000, 5,000," or what have you

633
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,750
left to evacuate.

634
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,050
I think it was,
"We are going to bring out

635
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:05,800
"everybody we have left
at the airport

636
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,220
"and everybody
who might show up,

637
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,970
"and at a point in time,

638
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:14,150
"the embassy will evacuate
its few hundred by buses to us

639
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,640
and it'll be over."

640
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:21,320
But unfortunately,
the plan was compromised.

641
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:26,700
<font color="#ffff00">JIM LAURIE</font>: Vietnamese would
come up to these pick-up points

642
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:31,280
and just my to get on the buses.

643
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:33,660
It was word of mouth.

644
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:45,840
Everybody in Saigon that day
seemed to want to leave.

645
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,560
And by the time I got to my
pick-up point, it was chaos.

646
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,680
Take it easy now, one at a time!

647
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:16,700
<font color="#ffff00">LAURIE</font>:
Everybody knew these buses

648
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:20,370
were going to be going out
to Tan San Nhut airbase

649
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:24,100
and there would be an escape
from Vietnam.

650
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,230
<font color="#ffff00">MCNAMARA</font>: I got a telephone
call from Saigon

651
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:48,200
saying that the president
had given an order for us

652
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:51,030
to evacuate all Americans.

653
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:54,120
Everybody was alerted,

654
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:59,370
including all the Vietnamese
that l had informed.

655
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:03,710
We got everybody
down to the boats.

656
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:07,590
Our plan was that my deputy
would bring up the rear,

657
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:10,840
and he would go through
the consulate buildings

658
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,640
and make sure
that we had destroyed

659
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,350
all of the sensitive materials.

660
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:20,020
Staff Sergeant Hasty stayed
and helped him.

661
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:24,150
<font color="#ffff00">HASTY</font>:
I made the last broadcast.

662
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:27,200
You know, "Saigon
and any monitoring station",

663
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,490
"this is Can Tho Consulate,
signing off the air.

664
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:33,990
We are evacuating."

665
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,830
And then we drove down

666
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:38,120
to where Terry McNamara
was loading people

667
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:41,830
onboard the landing craft.

668
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:46,250
We were trying to be, um...

669
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,300
as unobtrusive as possible
in doing so.

670
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,390
We did not want a repeat
of Da Nang.

671
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,100
We set sail
with two landing craft

672
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:03,140
packed with 18 Americans and
BOO-and-something Vietnamese.

673
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,940
The biggest concern, of course,

674
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,690
was basically
the North Vietnamese

675
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:11,570
<i>or what remnants
oi the VG were there</i>

676
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:16,030
would ambush us
at the narrowest portion,

677
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:18,000
and basically we'd get our ass
handed to us.

678
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,880
<font color="#ffff00">MCNAMARA</font>: We got some
distance from Can Tho

679
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,710
and suddenly, there were
some boats that came along,

680
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,010
and they fired across our bow.

681
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:35,510
<font color="#80FF00">(GUNSHOTS)</font>

682
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:37,890
<font color="#ffff00">HASTY</font>: They were South
Vietnamese navy boats

683
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:41,600
and they told us to heave to,

684
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,950
which we did because they were
extremely well armed.

685
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,650
Evidently, the orders
had gone out from on high

686
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:52,690
to stop, you know,
anybody going out.

687
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:57,070
<font color="#ffff00">MCNAMARA</font>: They had been given
orders to bring us back to Can Tho

688
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:00,620
because they thought that
we had deserters on board...

689
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:05,040
You know, military officers
and people of military age.

690
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,670
There actually were a couple,

691
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:09,710
including the deputy
air force commander

692
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:13,710
who put on civilian clothes
and snuck on the boat.

693
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,840
But I wasn't going to go back
to Can Tho,

694
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,270
so there was a standoff
in the middle of the river.

695
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:25,810
I asked the Vietnamese officer
in charge

696
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:32,610
to get in touch with the navy
commander, Commodore Thang.

697
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:37,410
I had gotten Commodore Thang's
wife and children out of Saigon.

698
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:41,580
I was hoping that he would
reciprocate.

699
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,450
And he did.

700
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:47,330
He came down finally and
in a very loud voice, he said,

701
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:50,080
"You don't have any
military people on here

702
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:51,710
or people of military age?"

703
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:53,390
And I said,
"Oh no, of course not."

704
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:58,180
Well, he told the sailors
to stand down,

705
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:03,140
and we continued down the river.

706
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:06,110
The chances of success
of going down the river

707
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:07,890
were 50/50 at best.

708
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:12,370
But we continued on nonetheless.

709
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,670
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>:
As the morning progressed,

710
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:34,170
the helicopter evacuation
was pretty well underway.

711
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:37,470
But the timing
of when it would be over

712
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:39,220
wasn't really our timing.

713
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:42,310
It was, frankly, what the North
Vietnamese would tolerate.

714
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:46,810
How long would they stand by
and let us do this?

715
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:54,280
But that morning, Ambassador
Martin received a message

716
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,940
that said within 24 hours,

717
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,740
the U.S. presence in Vietnam
had to be closed out.

718
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,950
Meaning, we had to be gone.

719
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:06,910
I was part of the Four-Party
Joint Military Team,

720
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:11,210
which was stationed out
at Tan Son Nhut.

721
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:13,630
We thought, "We're going
to get ordered to leave."

722
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:18,170
But instead, we got orders
from the ambassador

723
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:20,550
to go to the embassy

724
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:25,350
and be prepared to stay
after the embassy evacuated.

725
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:31,100
We were to be the sole U.S.
military presence in Vietnam

726
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:36,360
once the embassy evacuated
and the ambassador was gone.

727
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,070
You know, lock ourselves
in a room

728
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:40,660
and then come out
when the dust is settled

729
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,700
and introduce ourselves
to the North Vietnamese.

730
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,790
This was not a popular plan.

731
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:50,080
But we complied.

732
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:54,920
And around 11:00, 11:30,
we drove to the embassy.

733
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,640
And when we got there,
it was teeming with people.

734
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:08,060
<font color="#ffff00">MCBRIDE</font>: That morning, there
must have been, I would guess,

735
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:12,480
at least 10,000 people
literally ringing the embassy.

736
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,810
The embassy compound
was the size of a city block.

737
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,400
It was big.

738
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,820
And all sides of it were filled
200, 300 feet back.

739
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:27,740
Fortunately, people were
by and large very controlled.

740
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:31,250
They were very patient.

741
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:35,420
They were just hoping
desperately to get in.

742
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:38,840
<font color="#ffff00">PHO</font>:
It's like the whole of Saigon

743
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,670
want to get inside
the American embassy.

744
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:45,720
So you have to know somebody,
you know?

745
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,890
If you're like me,
I find my friend

746
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:54,560
and got a little paper
to ensure us to get in.

747
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,350
So several of us
went to the embassy.

748
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,570
Then my friend, he showed
the paper to the guard,

749
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:02,740
and he's just kind of pointing
at each one of us,

750
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:06,280
and we, one by one,
could go inside of the embassy.

751
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,780
When I first got in,
I feel so good.

752
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:14,750
"I'm in America...
I'm almost there."

753
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,880
They have a courtyard
and a swimming pool,

754
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,460
and we mostly gather
around the swimming pool.

755
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:26,470
And 1,000 people there,
and they just keep coming in.

756
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:34,890
<font color="#ffff00">SNEPP</font>: That morning, CIA choppers
began picking up evacuees

757
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:37,650
off the roofs of buildings
around the city

758
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:40,490
and bringing them
to the embassy.

759
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:47,660
There was an old pilot
named O.B. Harnage.

760
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:51,830
He was blind in one eye
and lame in one leg.

761
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:57,080
And I said, "Harnage,
we got people at 6 Gia Long."

762
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:00,790
You gotta go pick them up."

763
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:07,470
It was the deputy CIA station
chief's apartment building.

764
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:11,300
There were a number
of very high-risk Vietnamese,

765
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,520
including the defense minister
of South Vietnam,

766
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:17,770
all waiting to be rescued.

767
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:21,860
As they climbed up the ladder
to the roof,

768
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:25,570
a photographer took
that famous photograph.

769
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:28,780
Many people thought
that was the U.S. embassy.

770
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,410
It wasn't.

771
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:34,370
But it indicated to what extent
chaos had descended

772
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:36,870
on this entire operation.

773
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:45,170
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>: So the CIA choppers
were bringing people to the embassy

774
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:50,930
who where then supposed to go
to Tan Son Nhut airbase by bus,

775
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:53,060
where they would magically
find their way

776
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,480
to heavy lift helicopters.

777
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,180
It was very clear
to the citizenry

778
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,900
that something was up,

779
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,740
and that something was probably
the Americans are leaving.

780
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,610
Inside the embassy,
we discovered

781
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:12,990
as we walked through the
buildings and the outbuildings

782
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:16,290
and the swimming pool area
and the social club area,

783
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:20,210
everywhere we looked
was teeming with Vietnamese.

784
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:22,880
We counted them,
and the total number

785
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,340
was about 2,800.

786
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:29,130
There was no hiding it
that somehow,

787
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,680
people had to have let
these people into the embassy.

788
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,760
Was it, you know,

789
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,860
Marine security guards who kind
of looked the other way?

790
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,600
Was it American employees
in the embassy

791
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,320
who were doing kind of
what we did with black ops

792
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,110
and taking care of their own?

793
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,520
We never got
to the bottom of that

794
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:51,610
and frankly,
we never pursued it.

795
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,160
One of my Marines said to me,

796
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,660
"You know, we should take out
the tailor."

797
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:59,620
There was a tailor who made
all our civilian clothes.

798
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,410
<i>So I said,</i>

799
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:03,420
"Why don't we
take out the cook too?"

800
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,340
He said, "Well, you should
take out the cook too",

801
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,680
"and all the other cooks.

802
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,170
"They should get out.

803
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:10,390
They had business
with Americans."

804
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:12,380
So they took the bread truck

805
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:15,850
and they rounded up the tailor,
the cooks and the dishwashers,

806
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:17,970
a few others and their families,

807
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:21,980
and drove them
into the embassy compound.

808
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:28,030
<font color="#ffff00">STUART HERRINGTON</font>:
The embassy had become a refuge.

809
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:31,440
People were hoping to get in,

810
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,820
and we were hoping
to get people out

811
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,200
and down to the airbase.

812
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,240
<font color="#80FF00">(BUS HONKING)</font>

813
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:44,580
<font color="#ffff00">JOE MCBRIDE</font>: You couldn't have gotten
to the airfield if you wanted to.

814
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:49,420
The roads were totally blocked.

815
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:54,050
It forced the buses
to come back.

816
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:57,800
So what if the master plan

817
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,680
to take people out by air
from Tungshen doesn't work?

818
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,900
Where's our fallback?

819
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,980
Where's Plan B?

820
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:08,610
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>: If we were going
to bring out everybody

821
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:11,860
who was inside the embassy,
it was obvious

822
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:17,410
that there was the need for
a hasty plan to be developed

823
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:21,660
for a helicopter airlift
out of the embassy to the fleet.

824
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:26,510
And we had less than 24 hours
to pull it off.

825
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:34,640
<font color="#ffff00">SNEPP</font>: There was in the
parking lot of the embassy

826
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,220
a great tamarind tree,

827
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:40,220
which the Ambassador
had often referred to

828
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:45,350
as "steadfast as the American
commitment in Vietnam."

829
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:47,730
The CIA station chief
that last morning said,

830
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:49,900
"Mr. Ambassador,
we have to cut this tree down."

831
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:56,910
<font color="#ffff00">VALDEZ</font>: You could not land any large
helicopters on the parking lot

832
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:01,410
unless the tree and all
the shrubbery was all gone.

833
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:05,910
The Ambassador had resisted us
cutting that tree

834
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:10,250
because he did not want anybody
to be alerted

835
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:12,750
that we were doing
any sort of evacuation

836
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,430
or were going to do
any sort of evacuation.

837
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:20,680
<font color="#ffff00">SULLIVAN</font>: He was upset.

838
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:24,890
But finally he succumbed,
you know, to just common sense

839
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:26,770
and gave up his, uh...

840
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:28,610
I guess you could call it
a dream.

841
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:30,810
And we cut it down.

842
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:32,690
<font color="#80FF00">(CHAINSAWS BUZZING)</font>

843
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,700
<font color="#ffff00">SNEPP</font>: He had also, for
the past few days,

844
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:41,910
prevented us from burning
classified documents

845
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:45,210
for fear that it would panic
the South Vietnamese.

846
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:48,120
So that morning of the 29th,

847
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:52,250
we had thousands of pages
of classified documents

848
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:56,960
we had failed to destroy
beforehand.

849
00:55:56,970 --> 00:56:00,180
Our next job was just looking
at that classified document idea

850
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,720
and getting rid of that.

851
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,390
So we went to every office

852
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:06,890
and told them to start
pulling stuff,

853
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:10,560
and piles and piles of paper
began coming out.

854
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,160
And we began shredding.

855
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:23,570
There was a small building
where we handled the pay

856
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:27,660
for the Vietnamese
who worked for the embassy.

857
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,450
And in this building,

858
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:32,330
there was over $1 million
in U.S. currency.

859
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:37,000
So we had to send a message
to the Navy,

860
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:38,680
who sent it
to the Treasury Department,

861
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,300
who came back and said,
"Destroy it."

862
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:45,850
Sol assigned a few Marines
to get rid of the money.

863
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:49,020
And I said, "Oh, by the way,
we're gonna lock you in there."

864
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,440
It took them eight hours
to burn a million dollars.

865
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:56,230
<font color="#ffff00">ARMITAGE</font>: That morning,

866
00:56:56,230 --> 00:57:00,280
fear and desperation
were the order of the day.

867
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,740
But I had a job to do,

868
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,120
and it was an important job
to do, I thought,

869
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,710
to deny the enemy the South
Vietnamese Naval ships.

870
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:36,200
<font color="#ffff00">ARMITAGE</font>:
We had expected, frankly,

871
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,730
a longer time period
to get ready.

872
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:41,820
We had been told by people
in our intelligence community

873
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:43,870
that we might have as long
as the 4th of May,

874
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:48,330
but the North Vietnamese
were closing in quite tightly,

875
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:51,300
and clearly it was time
to send the signal to leave.

876
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:19,770
<font color="#ffff00">ARMITAGE</font>: I knew this,

877
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:21,900
but I didn't know
how many civilians

878
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,440
were gonna be on board.

879
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,450
I had no idea.

880
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,200
KIEM DO:

881
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,700
<font color="#ffff00">GERALD BERRY</font>: I was the
first one into the embassy.

882
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:14,160
And my only mission
at this time,

883
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,290
this is early in the afternoon,
was to bring the Ambassador out.

884
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:20,330
It was actually a mission that
was called "Embassy Snatch."

885
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:23,500
I was just supposed
to get the Ambassador.

886
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,670
I land and I said to the people,

887
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:29,130
I said, "I'm here to get
the Ambassador."

888
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,340
Well, not quite.

889
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:36,180
<font color="#ffff00">SNEPP</font>: The Ambassador refused
to leave until he could get

890
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:41,020
as many Vietnamese
on as many choppers as possible.

891
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:45,320
The evacuation
of Vietnamese happened

892
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,910
because Graham Martin
wanted it to happen.

893
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:04,170
<font color="#ffff00">BERRY</font>: So they loaded some
Vietnamese onto my helicopter

894
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:06,010
and because I'm supposed to have
the Ambassador on board,

895
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:08,050
we go right to the command ship,
the USS Blue Ridge.

896
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:14,430
We land on the Blue Ridge,
General Carey comes out,

897
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:16,270
wants to know where
the Ambassador is.

898
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:18,060
I said,
"Well, he didn't get on."

899
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,940
I mean, I don’t know
who I'm supposed to tell,

900
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:21,860
but I told everybody I was
supposed to get the Ambassador

901
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:23,230
but the Ambassador
didn't get on.

902
01:00:23,230 --> 01:00:25,070
So that starts the lift.

903
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:32,160
Like I say, we had
75 Marine Corps helicopters.

904
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,080
You and your wingman
would fly into the embassy,

905
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,080
get your passengers loaded,

906
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,960
and fly back out to the ships.

907
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:52,220
It was a little over an hour
back and forth.

908
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:09,700
<font color="#ffff00">PAUL JACOBS</font>: On the USS
Kirk, our mission was

909
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,530
to protect
the helicopters moving

910
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:13,700
from the embassy out
to the aircraft carriers

911
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:15,740
and back and forth.

912
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,620
We were very close
to the action.

913
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:23,210
<font color="#ffff00">HUGH DOYLE</font>: You could
stand there on the deck

914
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:26,290
and you could
watch it all happening.

915
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:28,970
We thought that the USS Kirk
was just going to be

916
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:32,260
an observer to this whole thing

917
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:33,600
and when all of a sudden

918
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,140
on radar we started seeing
these little blips

919
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,560
coming out from the shore.

920
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,810
<font color="#ffff00">MAN</font>: I really don't
know where to start.

921
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:43,110
We looked up at the horizon
and all you could see

922
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:46,860
were helicopters all heading
toward us.

923
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:49,200
<font color="#ffff00">DOYLE</font>: These were not
Marine Corps helicopters.

924
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,200
They were small helicopters,
the little Hueys,

925
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,990
which were never part
of the evacuation plan.

926
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:58,490
But they were flying
over top of us.

927
01:01:58,490 --> 01:01:59,490
We were watching them fly

928
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:02,120
over top over and over
and over again.

929
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:09,340
<font color="#ffff00">JACOBS</font>: We viewed them as enemy
until we could verify who it was.

930
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,970
Then we realized that these

931
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:18,140
were South Vietnamese
trying to escape.

932
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:19,560
I figured if we could save one,

933
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,680
at least we'd save
15, 20 people.

934
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:27,520
They were packed in there
like sardines.

935
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,690
Sol made the decision.

936
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:32,900
Land the helicopter.

937
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:35,740
<font color="#ffff00">DOYLE</font>: One of our sailors could
speak rudimentary Vietnamese.

938
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:38,870
So we put him on the radio
and he started broadcasting.

939
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:40,660
"This is ship 1087.

940
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:44,450
Land here."

941
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,120
So, we got his attention.

942
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:50,710
He came flying over
and landed on our flight deck.

943
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:53,720
And it turned out that
the pilot, he was the pilot

944
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:57,380
for the deputy chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

945
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:59,550
Real high up.

946
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:02,850
And he had the general with him,
who was a two-star general,

947
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:06,520
and the two-star general's
nephew, three women,

948
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,900
and about four children.

949
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:12,110
It was a big deal for us.

950
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:14,150
When it landed,
we got everything off.

951
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,070
And I looked up
because there were five, six,

952
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:19,660
seven stacked up ready to land.

953
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:22,910
<font color="#ffff00">DOYLE</font>: Turned out all throughout
the southern part of Vietnam

954
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:27,210
there were South Vietnamese Army
and Air Force installations

955
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:29,430
with one or two or three
or four helicopters.

956
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,340
And those helicopters
were flyable.

957
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:34,460
Their pilots were there.

958
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:37,550
And when they realized that
the evacuation was happening

959
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,800
and they weren't going
to be part of it, they said,

960
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,430
"Oh yeah, we are."

961
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:45,930
<font color="#ffff00">JACOBS</font>: These young Vietnamese
pilots would go to their homes,

962
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:49,360
land right in their front yards,
pick up their families

963
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:51,650
and anybody else,
and head out to sea,

964
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:53,450
hoping they can rendezvous
with a ship.

965
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:57,160
Well, we're one of the
first ships they saw.

966
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:02,620
<font color="#ffff00">DOYLE</font>:
Our flight deck will only take

967
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,580
one helicopter at a time
landing.

968
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:06,080
There are no wheels on them.

969
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,580
They just have skids.

970
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,830
We couldn't think of what else
to do and these other planes

971
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:11,580
were looking for a place to land

972
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:14,790
so we just physically
pushed them.

973
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,140
Of course, this was a big old
helicopter, thousands of pounds,

974
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:19,800
so we had to figure out how
to get it 15 feet over

975
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,550
to the edge of the flight deck.

976
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,230
You don't have time to think
about what you did,

977
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:28,230
you just had to do it.

978
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:32,820
So, we open up our flight deck
and they begin to land,

979
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:36,360
one right after the other.

980
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:39,240
Some of them were shot at,
holes in them.

981
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:45,490
<font color="#ffff00">DOYLE</font>: Most of the Vietnamese
who came out, I'm talking

982
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:49,000
about the flight crews,
they were heavily armed,

983
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,590
all with side arms,
some with M-16 rifles.

984
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:55,010
They had no idea what was going
to happen so they came out

985
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:57,840
ready for anything, really.

986
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,680
So we had to disarm them.

987
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:07,430
None of them had ever landed
on a ship before.

988
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:08,900
They were Vietnamese Air Force.

989
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,730
Everybody had a gun and we took
all the guns away from them.

990
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:14,030
Then about five minutes later
another one came in and landed.

991
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:17,200
And we pushed his airplane
over the side.

992
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:22,360
That was the second one.

993
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,120
I helped push that one over,
too.

994
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,710
Then the third plane came in.

995
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:27,990
It landed also.

996
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:29,490
We pushed it over the side.

997
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:32,750
So meanwhile, we've thrown three
helicopters in the water so far.

998
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:34,120
This is incredible.

999
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,750
I know you probably
don't believe any of this,

1000
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:37,920
but it's all true.

1001
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:53,730
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>: By late afternoon,

1002
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:56,730
the chopper flow at the embassy
really started.

1003
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:01,570
And each time a bird came in,

1004
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:03,740
here would go another
40, 50 people.

1005
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:08,580
But did the right mix of people
get out?

1006
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:12,700
You know, who says that
these were the people

1007
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:15,080
who either deserved
or should have gone out?

1008
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:18,920
At the embassy a lot
of the people who got out

1009
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:21,970
happened to be good
wall jumpers.

1010
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:27,430
<font color="#ffff00">VALDEZ</font>: The choppers started
coming in at ten-minute intervals.

1011
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:29,430
One would land on the roof

1012
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:32,220
and one would land
on the parking lot.

1013
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:34,850
They would put all
the Vietnamese in groups,

1014
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:37,070
they would search them,
and if they had any weapons

1015
01:06:37,070 --> 01:06:40,570
all those weapons were thrown
into the swimming pool.

1016
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:44,160
And as soon as the chopper
would land they would be brought

1017
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:48,780
into the restricted area where
a couple of the Marines

1018
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,960
would escort them
into the aircraft.

1019
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:59,630
Then they would raise
the ramp up and take off.

1020
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:06,640
<font color="#ffff00">BINH PHO</font>:
I remember l talked to my friend

1021
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,720
and he said,
"Oh, it's our turn now.

1022
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:09,840
We're almost there."

1023
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:11,270
You know, so we're all excited.

1024
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:15,310
And I remember very
distinctively that every time

1025
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:17,440
the helicopter coming down
it just blew us away.

1026
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,900
We have to kind of duck down

1027
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:21,780
to fight with the wind
of the chopper.

1028
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:31,290
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>: Three of the choppers
that came in each landed a platoon

1029
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:33,830
of 40 Marines
from the task force.

1030
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:36,880
And they had to be brought in
because we didn't have enough.

1031
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:41,000
Marines in the embassy security
guard to secure the walls.

1032
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:50,480
<font color="#ffff00">PHAM</font>: I went with my
wife to the embassy.

1033
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:58,230
A lot of people, they clenched
to the top of the wall,

1034
01:07:58,230 --> 01:07:59,440
but they couldn't get in.

1035
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:13,620
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>: Each gate
was besieged like that,

1036
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:18,200
although the side gate was the
principal place where they came.

1037
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:21,040
People holding letters saying,

1038
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,630
you know,
"l worked for the Americans.

1039
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:23,670
Please let me in."

1040
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:31,630
Journalists were arriving
and counting on being recognized

1041
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,510
to be let in by the Marines.

1042
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:47,070
There was a sea of people

1043
01:08:47,070 --> 01:08:51,490
wanting to get out
by helicopters.

1044
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:57,910
But, well, they looked up
at the helicopters leaving

1045
01:08:57,910 --> 01:09:01,870
and I could see their eyes.

1046
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:03,800
Desperate eyes.

1047
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:16,980
<font color="#ffff00">MIKI NGUYEN</font>:
My dad flew a Chinook helicopter

1048
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:20,350
in the South Vietnamese
Air Force.

1049
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:24,270
He had been waiting for orders
but his captain had,

1050
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:27,070
you know, basically just left.

1051
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:29,900
So he and some other pilots

1052
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:33,780
picked out the best Chinooks
and took off.

1053
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:41,300
He said it was the Wild West
at this point.

1054
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,460
Just you and your horse and you
just do what you had to do

1055
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:50,090
to survive
and take care of your family.

1056
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:53,220
He had given my mom a heads-up

1057
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:58,300
that if she did hear
a Chinook coming, to get ready.

1058
01:09:58,310 --> 01:10:01,310
I was six and a half years old.

1059
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:03,150
I can still hear the rumbling,

1060
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:07,360
a very, you know, familiar
rumbling of a Chinook.

1061
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,400
When you hear the Chinook
coming, you know it's coming.

1062
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:10,490
I knew my dad was coming.

1063
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,610
In Saigon, during my childhood,

1064
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:21,490
it was like, say, living in
the middle of busy L.A.

1065
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:26,210
So, there's really not
a big area to land the Chinook.

1066
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:32,760
So he came in and landed
in a playfield.

1067
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,590
Caused a lot of wind,
caused a lot of commotion.

1068
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:39,680
My mom grabbed my little sister,

1069
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,980
who was about six months
at that time,

1070
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,850
and I have a little brother
who was

1071
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:46,730
about three or four years old,
and myself.

1072
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:53,190
We quickly ran into the Chinook
and we all flew off

1073
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:57,070
out into the Pacific Ocean.

1074
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,620
My dad was afraid
for not having enough fuel,

1075
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:05,830
afraid for a lot of things.

1076
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:08,210
He was just flying blind.

1077
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:11,050
And then he saw a ship
out there.

1078
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:16,380
<font color="#ffff00">DOYLE</font>: In the middle of the
day, after we had taken

1079
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:18,840
those first helicopters aboard,

1080
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:22,050
this huge helicopter called
a Chinook,

1081
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,900
it came out and tried to land on
the ship.

1082
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:27,650
And oh, we almost... the thing
almost crashed onboard our ship.

1083
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:29,650
<font color="#ffff00">JACOBS</font>:
This big Chinook showed up.

1084
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:33,400
There's no way he could land

1085
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,070
<i>on Kirk without impacting
the ship.</i>

1086
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:39,070
He would have killed everybody
on this helicopter plus my crew.

1087
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:42,410
<font color="#ffff00">DOYLE</font>:
It was way too big to land.

1088
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:46,080
We thought that the helicopter
would just fly away.

1089
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,550
But as the ship was moving
forward probably four, five,

1090
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:52,390
six knots, something like that,
the pilot communicated

1091
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:54,840
that he was running low on fuel.

1092
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:58,720
<font color="#ffff00">JACOBS</font>: He opened up the port side
of the helicopter and he hovered

1093
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,890
across the stern of the <i>Kirk.</i>

1094
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:04,390
Then, all of a sudden,
here comes a human.

1095
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:09,190
<font color="#ffff00">NGUYEN</font>: One by one, we jump out.

1096
01:12:09,190 --> 01:12:11,190
I jumped out,
my brother jumped out.

1097
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:17,780
My mom was holding my sister,
obviously very scared.

1098
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:23,280
And she just, you know, just
trustingly, just with one hand,

1099
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:27,040
with her right hand, holding on
with her left to brace herself,

1100
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:31,540
you know,
just dropped my baby sister.

1101
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:34,670
<font color="#ffff00">DOYLE</font>: One fella is standing
there and he said he looked up

1102
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:37,140
and he saw this big bundle
of stuff come flying out

1103
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:38,670
and it was a baby.

1104
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:39,930
It was the one-year-old baby.

1105
01:12:42,970 --> 01:12:47,310
And then the mother jumped out
and he caught her, too.

1106
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:52,440
Then the pilot flew out
on our starboard, right side.

1107
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:57,570
He hovered with his wheels
in and out of the water.

1108
01:12:57,570 --> 01:12:59,660
He hovered there for like
ten minutes and we couldn't

1109
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:01,280
figure out what he was doing
and it turned out

1110
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,500
what he was doing was taking
his flight suit off.

1111
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:07,870
Here's a man flying a twin rotor
helicopter by himself,

1112
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:11,540
and at the same time
he's taking off a flight suit.

1113
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:13,630
How you do it, I've talked
to helicopter pilots

1114
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:16,170
and they can't figure out how he
did that, you know, how...

1115
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:18,340
like a Houdini,
trying to get out of this thing.

1116
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:21,390
And finally, he made
the helicopter roll to the right

1117
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:26,180
as he stepped out the door
on the left.

1118
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:29,970
<font color="#80FF00">(LOUD CRASH)</font>

1119
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:33,060
<font color="#ffff00">NGUYEN</font>:
Just thunderous loud noise.

1120
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:38,860
The shrapnel is just blowing up.

1121
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:40,160
And suddenly just quiet.

1122
01:13:43,570 --> 01:13:44,860
And he pops up.

1123
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:46,200
And he's alive.

01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,160

1125
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,620
<font color="#ffff00">DOYLE</font>: And he swam away.

1126
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:53,340
And the helicopter
was only about 20 feet from him

1127
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:54,930
when it hit the water;
It was amazing.

1128
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,710
<font color="#80FF00">(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</font>

1129
01:13:57,710 --> 01:13:59,210
We went out and picked him up.

1130
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:00,760
He was none,
no worse for the wear.

1131
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,840
He was a little bit wet.

1132
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:06,100
Only one unfortunate thing is
he had some small bars of gold,

1133
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,020
which was all his worldly
possessions,

1134
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:11,390
that were in his shirt pocket
and it sank.

1135
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:12,810
So he lost everything.

1136
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:14,480
He didn’t own
a thing but his underwear

1137
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,270
when he finally came aboard
the ship.

1138
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:21,230
He was a tremendous pilot.

1139
01:14:21,230 --> 01:14:24,950
The guy was just so cool
and calm.

1140
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:30,160
We've so far taken a total
of 17 helicopters.

1141
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:33,410
We ended up with 157 people
aboard this ship.

1142
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:43,050
<font color="#ffff00">JACOBS</font>:
And that crew was very special.

1143
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:46,100
They went, they took their
money, went to the Navy exchange

1144
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:49,520
and commissary, bought all the
clothes and food they could get,

1145
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:52,640
took it up and gave it to the
refugees they had befriended.

1146
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,520
They were unbelievable.

1147
01:14:57,650 --> 01:15:01,110
<font color="#ffff00">DOYLE</font>: We laid mats and all
kinds of blankets and stuff out

1148
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:02,690
on the deck for the babies.

1149
01:15:02,690 --> 01:15:04,620
And there were all kinds of...
there were infants

1150
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,780
and children and women,

1151
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:09,950
and oh, it was a scene
I'll never forget.

1152
01:15:12,410 --> 01:15:13,910
<font color="#ffff00">NGUYEN</font>: We were happy.

1153
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:17,080
My mom was just, you know, wow.

01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,430
Symbolically, it was like,
you know, the first step

1155
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:23,800
onto not American soil,
but American freedom.

our landing craft in the lead.

four or five hours from Can Tho.

The sun is beating down,
it's hotter than hell.

01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:23,980
A less than pleasant voyage.

We immediately started
returning fire.

We weren't sure who the dip-wad
was that was opening up on us,

"Once we hit the absolute
narrowest portion,

1170
01:16:57,970 --> 01:17:02,390
"that's where we're going
to really be in danger.

1171
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,400
Stack the ammo because
this one's gonna be ugly."

1172
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:12,700
<font color="#ffff00">MCNAMARA</font>: The people on
the boat were scared.

1173
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:16,120
We had to go through narrow
channels between the islands.

1174
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:22,330
If we're gonna really get hit,
it'll be there.

1175
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:30,090
But just at that point,
dark clouds formed in the sky

1176
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:32,590
and it started raining
like hell.

1177
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:37,140
<font color="#80FF00">(RAIN POURING)</font>

1178
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:40,980
<font color="#ffff00">HASTY</font>: Could not see the bow of
the landing craft from the stern,

1179
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,940
and that's 60 feet.

1180
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:49,530
The noise of the rain
hitting the water on the river

1181
01:17:49,530 --> 01:17:54,410
was so loud that it muffled
the sound of our engines.

1182
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:59,160
And this continued on
for about 25 minutes.

1183
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:01,790
It was long enough
to get us through

1184
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:05,120
the most dangerous part
of the trip.

1185
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:08,630
And as the rain started
to let up,

1186
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:10,800
we had reached the area
of the river past the channel,

1187
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,390
past the little islands,

1188
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:16,390
where it opened up
into a broad river again.

1189
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:19,980
So somebody was looking out
for us that day.

1190
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:28,480
<font color="#ffff00">MCNAMARA</font>: I remember looking
back at the sun setting

1191
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:32,480
over the Mekong Delta,
which is a beautiful place,

1192
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:35,240
and thinking, "Well,
I'll never see this again."

1193
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:41,620
I had gotten very attached
to Vietnam.

1194
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:44,910
<font color="#ffff00">HASTY</font>: As we came out
into the South China Sea,

1195
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:48,130
it got dark,
and every now and then,

1196
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:52,340
I would fire off
a couple of flares,

1197
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:57,220
just in hopes that, you know,
maybe there is a ship out there.

1198
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:58,840
Nothing.

1199
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:01,270
And then we saw a faint light
on the horizon,

1200
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:03,230
and as we got
a little bit closer,

1201
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:06,520
we could see that they were
the lights of a ship's rigging.

1202
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,110
So we said, "What the heck?"

1203
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:09,860
So we made for it.

1204
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:17,610
We came up alongside

1205
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:20,580
and somebody shouted,
"Get rid of your weapons.

1206
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:24,450
Nobody comes aboard
with weapons."

1207
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:26,660
Sol yelled, "We're Marines"

1208
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:30,080
and we're coming aboard
with our weapons."

1209
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:32,710
Well, as it turned out, the guys
yelling down were Marines.

1210
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:37,930
<font color="#ffff00">MCNAMARA</font>: It was an American
freighter, the <i>Pioneer</i> Contender.

1211
01:19:37,930 --> 01:19:40,430
They took us aboard.

1212
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:43,680
And I had 300 people with me.

1213
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:47,860
They got them
into the hold of the ship.

1214
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:56,240
<font color="#ffff00">HASTY</font>: All our Vietnamese remained
on the Pioneer Con tender.

1215
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:59,530
We made sure
they were taken care of

1216
01:19:59,530 --> 01:20:03,160
<i>and the Pioneer Contender
was going to</i> Guam.

1217
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,080
We knew they were safe.

1218
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:28,650
<font color="#ffff00">BERRY</font>:
When we started the evacuation

1219
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:31,070
we were very, very excited
about it.

1220
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:33,810
Then your next emotion
probably was

1221
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:37,190
just determined to get this job
done and get these people out.

1222
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:42,910
And then, later <i>as</i> it went on
you became fatigued

1223
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:46,130
and frustrated that you could
never make a dent in the amount

1224
01:20:46,130 --> 01:20:49,670
of people that were coming out
of the embassy.

1225
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:54,300
You’d ask questions like, was
the crowd getting any smaller?

1226
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,470
"When are we going
to finish this?" you know.

1227
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:57,960
And they'd say,

1228
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,840
"You know, we're under orders
from the Ambassador.

1229
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,630
We're doing the best we can."

1230
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,010
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>:
Carrier pilots were saying,

1231
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:07,890
look, it's an uncontrollable sea
of people

1232
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:11,140
and Ambassador Martin has lost
his objectivity,

1233
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:13,270
that Ambassador Martin is trying
to evacuate

1234
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:15,520
all of Saigon
through the U.S. embassy.

1235
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:21,830
But he was doing his best
under terrible circumstances.

1236
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:27,250
<font color="#ffff00">JOSEPH MCBRIDE</font>: Ambassador Martin
was dragging out the evacuation

1237
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:28,910
<i>as</i> long as he could

1238
01:21:28,910 --> 01:21:32,710
to get as many South Vietnamese
out as possible.

1239
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:36,760
Each helicopter took
about 40 people.

1240
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:41,260
He knew that once the Americans
were gone,

1241
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:44,140
the evacuation would be over.

1242
01:21:46,390 --> 01:21:51,230
So they just put one or two
Americans on each one.

1243
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:02,370
You're very tired and you're
not seeing an end to this thing.

1244
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:04,070
Sol got the word out,

1245
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:07,910
"You know, we could use
some help out here.

1246
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:09,710
We only have 75 helicopters."

1247
01:22:09,710 --> 01:22:13,120
And the word comes back, "No."

1248
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,380
No, Marine pilots
don't get tired."

1249
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:25,640
Back at the embassy under
the Ambassador's direction,

1250
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:28,760
we, of course, were taking
advantage

1251
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:32,230
of the presence of the aircraft
to evacuate threatened folks.

1252
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:40,240
But there were other independent
efforts to get people out.

1253
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:46,750
<font color="#ffff00">MCBRIDE</font>: Several of us at the embassy
agreed that we would drive vans

1254
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:50,590
down to the docks
on the Saigon River.

1255
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:57,500
I had an assigned assembly point
in the middle of Saigon,

1256
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:01,750
and I crammed about 15 people
into a nine-person van

1257
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:05,010
and then drove through
the streets of Saigon

1258
01:23:05,010 --> 01:23:11,640
through various checkpoints
down to the docks.

1259
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:16,020
People would get out

1260
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:19,740
and go running for these
commercial boats and get on.

1261
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:25,150
I made a number of runs
and there‘d just be more

1262
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:27,250
and more and more people.

1263
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:38,960
Finally, as the sun
was going down,

1264
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,170
we were running out of light.

1265
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:45,880
Man came up to me.

1266
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:50,840
I turned to him and said,
"This is my last load.

1267
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:52,810
L, you know,
I can't take anymore."

1268
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:54,310
I said, "Well, get your family."

1269
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:55,520
And he said, "Can’t do it."

1270
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:56,980
"My family's too big.

1271
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:59,820
My family's too big."

1272
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:08,200
And he just shook my hand
and said, "Thanks for trying,"

1273
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:09,570
and walked away.

1274
01:24:09,570 --> 01:24:15,910
Sol came back to the embassy
and parked the van.

1275
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:19,790
It was already getting
well into twilight.

1276
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:21,590
Got my way through the crowd.

1277
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:23,180
It was a big crowd.

1278
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:29,680
I had nothing more I could do.

1279
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:33,430
So I went to get
on the helicopter

1280
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:37,020
and Ambassador Martin pulled me
out of line and he said,

1281
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:38,810
"l know what you've been doing.

1282
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:40,190
"l know you’ve been out there.

1283
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:41,480
"We've been talking.

1284
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,480
I want to thank you."

1285
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:46,330
I thought that
was a kind gesture.

1286
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:51,660
By that time
it was definitely dark.

1287
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:55,990
The lights of the...
of the helicopter inside

1288
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:58,910
radiated very clearly.

1289
01:24:58,910 --> 01:25:01,250
I sat down, looked around.

1290
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:04,840
I was one of maybe
two or three Americans.

1291
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:08,210
The rest were all Vietnamese.

1292
01:25:08,210 --> 01:25:11,060
And we flew out.

1293
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:16,100
<font color="#ffff00">PHO</font>: It was very dark.

1294
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:17,470
I remember that.

1295
01:25:17,470 --> 01:25:19,820
And people started to elbow
each other and try to get

1296
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:22,600
in the front line.

1297
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:25,110
And that's when
the Captain Herrington started

1298
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:27,400
speaking to us in Vietnamese.

1299
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,320
<font color="#80FF00">(SPEAKING VIETNAMESE)</font>

1300
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,570
"Nobody is going to be
left behind."

1301
01:25:31,570 --> 01:25:34,910
<font color="#80FF00">(SPEAKING VIETNAMESE)</font>

1302
01:25:34,910 --> 01:25:39,290
<font color="#ffff00">PHO</font>: And then he said, "when
you are in American embassy",

1303
01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:41,370
"you are in American soil.

1304
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:44,420
"l promise, me and my soldier
will be the last one

1305
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:45,960
leave the embassy."

1306
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:49,760
So after that announcement
everybody feel relaxed.

1307
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,760
Literally, we totally relaxed.

1308
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,230
We have nothing to worry about.

1309
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:54,940
Yeah.

1310
01:25:57,470 --> 01:25:59,220
<font color="#ffff00">HENRY KISSINGER</font>: We were told

1311
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:03,640
that the North Vietnamese tanks
were coming very close.

1312
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:06,110
So we asked,
we in the White House, asked

1313
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:11,820
the Defense Department how many
South Vietnamese were left.

1314
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:15,780
"“Left" meant inside
the embassy compound.

1315
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:18,250
And then we calculated
how many helicopters

1316
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:22,370
it would take to get them out.

1317
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:28,920
We told Martin that he had
to be on the last helicopter.

1318
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,170
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>:
All I know is that in Washington

1319
01:26:31,170 --> 01:26:33,350
there was confusion
about the numbers on the ground.

1320
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:40,850
At 1:00 a.m. there were
1,100 people left to evacuate.

1321
01:26:40,850 --> 01:26:42,560
After we'd had a flurry
of choppers

1322
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,780
and cleaned out
more than half of them

1323
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:47,310
and there were 420 people left,

1324
01:26:47,310 --> 01:26:50,110
we received an order
from Washington

1325
01:26:50,110 --> 01:26:52,070
that the lift was over

1326
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:54,950
other than the extraction
of the remaining Americans.

01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:11,880
You got to get
the Ambassador out."

1333
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:13,760
So we fly in.

1334
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:17,680
I land on the roof exactly at
4:50 in the morning and I said,

1335
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:23,220
"I'm not leaving until
the Ambassador's onboard."

1336
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:26,230
<font color="#ffff00">VALDEZ</font>: One of the Marines
lowered the flag, folded it up

1337
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:29,320
and escorted the Ambassador
up to the landing zone

1338
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:30,690
up on top of the embassy

1339
01:27:30,690 --> 01:27:33,690
and he gave him the flag

1340
01:27:33,690 --> 01:27:36,290
and, uh, that was it.

1341
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:41,960
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>: Major Kean came to
Colonel Madison, said, "No more."

1342
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:43,950
Only Americans
from this point on."

1343
01:27:43,950 --> 01:27:47,040
And Madison said,
"The hell you say.

1344
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,040
We've got these people
over here."

1345
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:53,040
And Kean said,
"Sir, not going to happen.

1346
01:27:53,050 --> 01:27:55,710
It's a presidential order."

1347
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:58,060
And Madison said, <i>"I'll</i> take
this up with the Ambassador."

1348
01:27:58,060 --> 01:27:59,850
He was very hot
under the collar.

1349
01:27:59,850 --> 01:28:04,720
And Kean said,
"You can't, that's him,"

1350
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:08,450
and pointed to the CH-46
that was just flying away.

1351
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:18,490
<font color="#ffff00">BERRY</font>:
So the Ambassador's on board.

1352
01:28:18,490 --> 01:28:19,870
And out we go.

1353
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:27,660
<i>We land</i> on <i>the Blue Ridge.</i>

1354
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:32,040
15 or 20, maybe 25 people
get off with the Ambassador

1355
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,920
and that was the end of it.

1356
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:38,760
I flew 18.3 hours
straight through.

1357
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:43,090
Graham Martin looked very tired,
extremely haggard.

1358
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:46,310
I mean, he looked like... I'm
sure the pressure was immense.

1359
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:49,190
<font color="#ffff00">REPORTER</font>: And at what time
were you to cease evacuation?

1360
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:51,440
Cease evacuation?

1361
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:54,320
<font color="#ffff00">BERRY</font>: We could still be flying if
we hadn't gotten the Ambassador out

1362
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:59,610
because he refused to stop
the lift.

1363
01:28:59,610 --> 01:29:00,660
I think about 3:00.

1364
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:01,950
<font color="#ffff00">REPORTER</font>: 3:00 in the morning?

1365
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:03,290
No, 3:45.

1366
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:13,420
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>: Colonel Madison
says to me, "We're screwed."

1367
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:16,040
"Stu, you stay down here
in the parking lot

1368
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:18,960
and keep these 420 people warm"-

1369
01:29:18,970 --> 01:29:22,430
meaning if they see us
all leave at the same time

1370
01:29:22,430 --> 01:29:26,430
they'll panic-"and then make
your way to the roof.

1371
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:28,310
We gotta go."

1372
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:32,560
And he was very angry
and very disappointed.

1373
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,690
So they disappeared
into the embassy.

1374
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:38,440
And I went to where
the remaining Vietnamese

1375
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:40,940
who were waiting and told
them...

1376
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:44,910
<font color="#80FF00">(SPEAKING VIETNAMESE)</font>

1377
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:52,710
"Big helicopters about to come,"
and waited a few minutes.

1378
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:56,290
Then I saw a chopper take off
and I thought,

1379
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:59,880
"Shit, was I supposed to be
on that one?"

1380
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:02,430
So, I looked at the Vietnamese
and I said...

1381
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:03,930
<font color="#80FF00">(SPEAKING VIETNAMESE)</font>

1382
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:06,680
"l got to take a leak."

1383
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:10,100
And I left into the shadows.

1384
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:12,900
I made my way around
in a circuitous route

1385
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:14,990
and went into the embassy.

1386
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:22,830
I thought about how this
really, really was wrong.

1387
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:27,380
I thought maybe I should
just say, "I'm not leaving"

1388
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:30,950
till they go,
because I promised them."

1389
01:30:30,950 --> 01:30:33,370
And then I said,
"Don't be a fool.

1390
01:30:33,370 --> 01:30:34,920
"Maybe they've started
shooting down helicopters

1391
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:36,120
"for all you know.

1392
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:39,250
"You're not going to get
anybody else out.

1393
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:41,880
"It's a presidential order.

1394
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:44,880
This decision has been made."

1395
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:50,310
So, I got to the roof and a
CH-46 alighted on the rooftop,

1396
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:55,400
put its ramp down
and we got on board.

1397
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:02,440
As it took off,
the door was open.

1398
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:04,280
And down in the parking lot

1399
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,410
I could see the group
of 420 of them.

1400
01:31:06,410 --> 01:31:08,410
They were right were we had
left them marshaled

1401
01:31:08,410 --> 01:31:11,910
on this little patch of grass.

1402
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:14,950
I felt absolutely awful.

1403
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:21,180
It was just so...
serious and deep a betrayal.

1404
01:31:34,850 --> 01:31:37,810
<font color="#ffff00">JACOBS</font>: Later that night I was
quite surprised that I got

1405
01:31:37,810 --> 01:31:39,410
a call to
"Come alongside the flagship.

1406
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:42,320
The Admiral wants to speak
to you."

1407
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:46,900
My first reaction, as any CO,
is, "What did we do?"

1408
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:52,330
not realizing we had been picked
for a special mission.

1409
01:31:52,330 --> 01:31:55,120
<font color="#ffff00">DOYLE</font>: We were supposed
to pick up this person.

1410
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:58,380
He was 30 years old,
came aboard, civilian clothes.

1411
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:00,670
And the Captain was just told

1412
01:32:00,670 --> 01:32:05,710
to take his direction
from this guy.

1413
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:09,680
<font color="#ffff00">RICHARD ARMITAGE</font>: I went aboard the
Kirk and met with Captain Paul Jacobs.

1414
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:12,150
And the first thing he said
to me is,

1415
01:32:12,150 --> 01:32:15,140
"Young man, I'm not accustomed

1416
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:17,640
"to strange civilians coming
aboard my ship armed

1417
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:19,230
in the middle of the night."

1418
01:32:19,230 --> 01:32:21,530
And I said, "Captain,
I assure you, neither am l."

1419
01:32:21,530 --> 01:32:25,110
<font color="#ffff00">JACOBS</font>: He smelled like a
Naval officer, you know.

1420
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:26,740
You know, one officer
can smell another one.

1421
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:28,660
So, I looked him up
in the blue book.

1422
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:31,280
He's a graduate
of the Naval Academy.

1423
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,080
So from that point on
we were fine.

1424
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,330
"What do you want to do?"

1425
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:37,050
And we worked together
as a team.

1426
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:43,930
<font color="#ffff00">ARMITAGE</font>: We steamed down to Con
Son Island and we could see

1427
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:48,050
on the radar display that
there were a lot of blips.

1428
01:32:48,050 --> 01:32:50,720
And I remember dawn breaking
and the sun coming up,

1429
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:54,600
and seeing what I had seen
as a radar display in person.

1430
01:32:56,890 --> 01:33:00,310
There were dozens of ships.

1431
01:33:00,310 --> 01:33:05,190
And not just Vietnamese
naval ships,

1432
01:33:05,190 --> 01:33:08,400
but also civilian ships.

1433
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:12,280
And they were all totally
crammed with people.

1434
01:33:15,870 --> 01:33:19,540
<font color="#ffff00">JACOBS</font>:
There are no words to describe

1435
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:22,620
what a ship looks like
that holds 200

1436
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:25,040
and it’s got 2,000 on it.

1437
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:30,630
I don't think anybody really
understood the magnitude of it

1438
01:33:30,630 --> 01:33:33,760
until we looked at what
we got in front of us.

1439
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:37,560
It looked like something
out of Exodus.

1440
01:33:39,730 --> 01:33:45,100
Our mission was to help the
ships into international waters.

1441
01:33:45,110 --> 01:33:49,440
But now they had
all these people.

1442
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:53,320
My reaction is, "How the hell
are we going to do this?"

1443
01:33:55,620 --> 01:33:59,000
Most of the Vietnamese Navy
ships were dead in the water,

1444
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:04,420
some were anchored,
some were just adrift.

1445
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:06,540
So, we sent over our
engineering, technical people

1446
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:12,510
to see what we could do to help
them and get them underway.

1447
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:15,350
Some of these ships
had been hit by enemy fire

1448
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:16,810
coming down the Saigon River.

1449
01:34:16,810 --> 01:34:20,930
One of the boats had been hit
and sinking,

1450
01:34:20,930 --> 01:34:24,020
so it went alongside one of the
other Vietnamese Navy ships.

1451
01:34:24,030 --> 01:34:27,110
A wooden plank was thrown
between the two ships

1452
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:30,950
for the civilians and naval
personnel on the damaged ship

1453
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:33,400
to cross onto the ship
that wasn't.

1454
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:38,580
The seas were rolling and it was
a somewhat precarious passage.

1455
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:43,080
At one point,
a young Vietnamese man panicked

1456
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:47,290
as a young girl, I remember,
was walking across this plank,

1457
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:48,670
and he kind of rushed ahead
of her

1458
01:34:48,670 --> 01:34:50,300
and she fell
between the two ships.

1459
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:54,270
DOYLE <font color="#80FF00">(ON TAPE)</font>: Apparently one of
the Vietnamese men pushed a girl.

1460
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:55,680
She was killed.

1461
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:57,800
She was drowned
between the two ships,

1462
01:34:57,810 --> 01:35:00,850
and that almost started a panic.

1463
01:35:00,850 --> 01:35:04,100
A Vietnamese sailor
immediately shot this guy,

1464
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:05,730
and then order was restored.

1465
01:35:05,730 --> 01:35:08,480
DOYLE <font color="#80FF00">(ON TAPE)</font>: They said,
"There will be no pushing

1466
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:11,440
and there will be no shoving
on this ship."

1467
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,620
People calmed down greatly
after that.

1468
01:35:18,570 --> 01:35:24,750
<font color="#ffff00">ARMITAGE</font>: We had worked a plan out to
sail the ships to the Philippines.

1469
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:30,000
And the Kirk was going
to escort them.

1470
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
But the fact that
they're going to be crammed

1471
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,010
with an unknown number
of civilians

1472
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:36,670
was somewhat problematic.

1473
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:39,390
The U.S. government already had
a refugee problem

1474
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,430
with the U.S. Naval ships.

1475
01:35:41,430 --> 01:35:44,860
This was another 30,000
or more people to deal with.

1476
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:48,520
<font color="#ffff00">JACOBS</font>: We were up all
night talking about it.

1477
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:51,110
And I'm convinced that if we
sent them back or took them back

1478
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:52,360
they would have killed them all.

1479
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:57,650
And Armitage decided
to bring them.

1480
01:35:57,660 --> 01:36:01,530
And he didn't get permission
from Washington to do that.

1481
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:05,380
<font color="#ffff00">ARMITAGE</font>: I thought it was a
lot easier to beg forgiveness

1482
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:07,370
than to get permission.

1483
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:11,880
So the decision was made.

1484
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:13,970
And they all went with us.

1485
01:36:41,410 --> 01:36:44,830
<font color="#ffff00">MIKE SULLIVAN</font>: We had finally got
out the last of the refugees

1486
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:46,660
that we could get out.

1487
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:49,540
Now we had to evacuate
the Marines.

1488
01:36:52,130 --> 01:36:56,960
They were all inside the embassy
building except for us.

1489
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:00,680
I was still on the embassy
grounds with two of my sergeants

1490
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:02,680
and I said,
"You two stay right with me.

1491
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:04,100
Don't leave my side."

1492
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:07,930
We slowly walked backwards
to the embassy door

1493
01:37:07,930 --> 01:37:10,810
and a couple of Vietnamese
came towards me.

1494
01:37:10,810 --> 01:37:12,770
I said,
"We have no more helicopters.

1495
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:13,770
"That's it.

1496
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:15,110
"I'm sorry.

1497
01:37:15,110 --> 01:37:17,440
We cannot take you."

1498
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,110
And they began to argue with me.

1499
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:20,910
They spoke good English, too.

1500
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:22,660
"We can ride
in your helicopter."

1501
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:26,830
I said, "I'm sorry, no more."

1502
01:37:26,830 --> 01:37:30,160
So we spun around and slammed
these huge doors,

1503
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:33,590
and we locked it from behind.

1504
01:37:39,630 --> 01:37:41,730
<font color="#ffff00">PHO</font>: I kind of fall
asleep off and on,

1505
01:37:41,730 --> 01:37:44,930
but what gets me woke up
is the noise.

1506
01:37:44,930 --> 01:37:46,680
It's a different noise.

1507
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:49,350
Sol kind of look up.

1508
01:37:49,350 --> 01:37:52,060
And the first thing
in my sight was

1509
01:37:52,060 --> 01:37:58,270
I didn't see that soldier there
anymore on that wall.

1510
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:02,030
There were people throwing
blankets or jackets

1511
01:38:02,030 --> 01:38:03,700
and materials
over the barbed wire

1512
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:07,580
so they can climb over
the wire to come in.

1513
01:38:07,580 --> 01:38:11,040
It was like,
"Where are the soldiers?"

1514
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:14,670
<font color="#ffff00">SULLIVAN</font>:
We were going up the stairs.

1515
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:18,130
Below me I could hear
feet running on the stairway.

1516
01:38:18,130 --> 01:38:21,680
When we got to the roof, Master
Sergeant Valdez was there.

1517
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:23,550
He says, "We got everybody?"

1518
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:25,050
"Yeah."

1519
01:38:25,050 --> 01:38:28,850
I said, "Man, there's somebody
chasing me up those stairs."

1520
01:38:28,850 --> 01:38:32,680
<font color="#ffff00">VALDEZ</font>: There were wall
lockers up on the roof

1521
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:36,480
and those big fire extinguishers
with wheels so we tilted

1522
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,950
all those wall lockers
and the fire extinguishers,

1523
01:38:38,950 --> 01:38:42,070
put them against the door.

1524
01:38:42,070 --> 01:38:44,910
There was a little window there
that we could see them in there,

1525
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:50,160
all the Vietnamese trying
to get to the roof.

1526
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:54,870
The Marines started going out
as choppers came in.

1527
01:38:54,870 --> 01:39:00,040
Then all of a sudden
choppers all cease.

1528
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:02,470
There was 11 of us
still left there.

1529
01:39:08,390 --> 01:39:12,060
The briefing was delayed until
the evacuation was completed

1530
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:14,400
and the last helicopters
are now in the air.

1531
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:18,020
The President commends the
personnel of the armed forces

1532
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:21,360
who accomplished it, as well
as Ambassador Graham Martin

1533
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,240
and the staff of his mission
who served so well

1534
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:27,030
under difficult conditions.

1535
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:30,280
<font color="#ffff00">KISSINGER</font>: We were told that Martin
had left on the last helicopter

1536
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:33,160
and that the evacuation
had ended.

1537
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:38,250
I'm confident that every
American who wanted to come out

1538
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:39,960
is out.

1539
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:42,920
<font color="#ffff00">KISSINGER</font>:
So we held a briefing.

1540
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:45,050
Well, turned out not to be
the last helicopter

1541
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:49,090
because there was another
horrendous screw-up.

1542
01:39:49,090 --> 01:39:53,310
<font color="#ffff00">VALDEZ</font>:
There were no helicopters.

1543
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:56,610
You know, we were just kind
of sitting down around

1544
01:39:56,610 --> 01:39:58,310
looking at each other,

1545
01:39:58,310 --> 01:40:00,780
wondering, you know,
what's going to happen here,

1546
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:04,320
you know, whether they truly had
forgotten about us.

1547
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:10,160
<font color="#ffff00">SULLIVAN</font>: So l got on my radio and I
began saying, "U.S. Navy, U.S. Navy",

1548
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:13,780
American embassy, request
extraction immediate."

1549
01:40:13,790 --> 01:40:15,630
And I repeated this over
and over and over.

1550
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:20,630
The only option we had
was sit on the stupid roof

1551
01:40:20,630 --> 01:40:22,460
like a sitting duck.

1552
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:25,310
And I kept thinking, "Where
are the North Vietnamese?"

1553
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:31,140
<font color="#ffff00">VALDEZ</font>: About 7:45 in the
morning you could start seeing.

1554
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:35,220
North Vietnamese
coming down the road.

1555
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:37,480
My thoughts were, "What's
to keep them from bombing"

1556
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:40,200
"the top of the embassy roof
and blowing us off," you know?

1557
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,820
<font color="#ffff00">SULLIVAN</font>: A tank is
going to take one shot.

1558
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:47,320
If it hits the building,
you're gone.

1559
01:40:50,490 --> 01:40:52,960
So I didn't like the idea
of being up there,

1560
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:57,500
but where else are you
going to go?

1561
01:40:57,500 --> 01:41:02,250
Finally I looked out
and I saw a black dot.

1562
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:04,500
When that chopper landed,
I told the Marines,

1563
01:41:04,510 --> 01:41:07,880
"Go. Get in."

1564
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:11,930
I was the last one out.

1565
01:41:11,930 --> 01:41:16,140
And as I was putting my foot
on the ramp, I fell down,

1566
01:41:16,140 --> 01:41:20,020
and I'm just hanging on
and the ramp's going up.

1567
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:21,520
<font color="#ffff00">SULLIVAN</font>: The ramp is closing

1568
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:24,940
and I did what I was trained
in my first tour-count.

1569
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:28,190
So I went, "One, two, three,
four, five, six... ten."

1570
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:29,400
"Ten?

1571
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:31,530
"One, two, three, four, five,
six... ten.

1572
01:41:31,530 --> 01:41:32,910
Ten."

1573
01:41:32,910 --> 01:41:36,750
And I looked at the crew chief
and I said, "Put it down."

1574
01:41:36,750 --> 01:41:38,620
I knew I was missing one man.

1575
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:40,660
I remember looking at the ramp

1576
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:43,170
and two hands were over
the top of it.

1577
01:41:43,170 --> 01:41:44,460
<font color="#80FF00">(CHUCKLES)</font>

1578
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:46,210
So the Marines
just kind of grabbed me

1579
01:41:46,210 --> 01:41:48,050
and then just pulled me in.

1580
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:57,100
<font color="#ffff00">SULLIVAN</font>: We left, by my
watch, at 7:58 Saigon time.

1581
01:41:57,100 --> 01:41:59,980
And we were the last 11.

1582
01:42:05,770 --> 01:42:10,240
<font color="#ffff00">JIM LAURIE</font>: My cameraman, Neil
Davis, and I decided to stay.

1583
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:16,080
We saw the last helicopter leave
from the roof.

1584
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:20,800
We then tried to scramble
into the embassy ourselves.

1585
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,250
Neil got to the roof.

1586
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:24,000
I did not.

1587
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,920
And he saw dozens of Vietnamese

1588
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:30,050
just sitting on the helicopter
pad on the roof of the embassy,

1589
01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:33,420
waiting, wanting to get out.

1590
01:42:33,430 --> 01:42:36,270
And of course no more
helicopters were going to come.

1591
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:42,020
<font color="#ffff00">PHO</font>: I didn't join them.

1592
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:45,850
I actually... scared.

1593
01:42:45,850 --> 01:42:48,610
If the Communists come in,

1594
01:42:48,610 --> 01:42:50,450
the last thing
we want them to see us

1595
01:42:50,450 --> 01:42:52,440
is in the American embassy.

1596
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:53,440
So we get out.

1597
01:42:57,370 --> 01:43:00,460
<font color="#ffff00">LAURIE</font>: People were coming
in and out of the buildings.

1598
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:04,290
Literally, anything that could
not be fastened down

1599
01:43:04,290 --> 01:43:08,040
or was not fastened down
was being taken away.

1600
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:10,550
Any souvenirs
from the Ambassador's office

1601
01:43:10,550 --> 01:43:12,050
were taken away.

1602
01:43:12,050 --> 01:43:15,140
Almost brick by brick the
embassy was being dismantled.

1603
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:17,470
It was ordinary looting.

1604
01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:22,010
But more than that, I think it
was just frustration and anger

1605
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:26,310
and an opportunity to get back,
perhaps, at the Americans

1606
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:29,110
because in the view of many
in that crowd that day,

1607
01:43:29,110 --> 01:43:31,990
we had deserted them.

1608
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:41,830
NBC news correspondent
Jim Laurie

1609
01:43:41,830 --> 01:43:44,920
is one of the few Americans
still left in Saigon,

1610
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:48,460
in the city when President Duong
Van Minh went on the radio

1611
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:50,670
and told the Viet Cong

1612
01:43:50,670 --> 01:43:52,840
that his country would
surrender unconditionally

1613
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:56,550
and that he had told its army
to lay down its arms.

1614
01:43:56,550 --> 01:43:58,180
Here from Saigon radio hookup

1615
01:43:58,180 --> 01:44:00,390
is Laurie's report
on the surrender.

1616
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:04,480
<font color="#ffff00">LAURIE</font>: In the words of General
Minh, "We are here to hand over"

1617
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:09,650
the power of government to you
in order to avoid bloodshed.“

1618
01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:13,570
It is a unilateral ceasefire
and an unconditional surrender.

1619
01:44:13,570 --> 01:44:17,450
The 30-year war in South Vietnam
is at last over.

1620
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:45,640
The first thing I did was
to destroy my documents,

1621
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:51,230
my badges,
just keeping the civilian ID.

1622
01:44:51,230 --> 01:44:56,410
And then I went around Saigon
to see what happened.

1623
01:45:28,850 --> 01:45:36,230
I saw a lot of South Vietnamese
soldiers in underwear.

1624
01:45:36,230 --> 01:45:42,320
They took off all
their military clothes, boots,

1625
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,620
and they threw them away.

1626
01:45:52,710 --> 01:45:57,460
And I thought, well, what
would happen to them?

1627
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:02,680
And to me, to myself.

1628
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:04,430
Right.

1629
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:14,310
I thought of my friends who were
killed in action and I thought,

1630
01:46:14,310 --> 01:46:18,190
"Well, is this what
we fought for?"

1631
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:25,620
"ls this what the Americans
came for?"

1632
01:46:29,330 --> 01:46:32,420
And I didn't have the answer.

1633
01:46:38,590 --> 01:46:44,050
<font color="#ffff00">SNEPP</font>: I have wrestled
with this ever since.

1634
01:46:44,050 --> 01:46:48,350
I realized that l had become

1635
01:46:48,350 --> 01:46:51,520
the quintessential American
in Vietnam.

1636
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:55,560
I had all these causes, all
these big things I was doing.

1637
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:57,650
I was hying to get the truth
back to Washington.

1638
01:46:57,650 --> 01:47:01,280
I was talking to agents, trying
to persuade the Ambassador,

1639
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:06,250
and I forgot that what
was at stake were human lives.

1640
01:47:11,290 --> 01:47:16,250
<font color="#ffff00">PHO</font>: For years after that, I
hear that sound in my head,

1641
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:19,290
<i>that sound like,
"Tchk-tchk-tchk-tchk-tchk".</i>

1642
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:21,380
In the middle of the night
l just jump up.

1643
01:47:21,380 --> 01:47:23,050
I thought the helicopter come
pick me up.

1644
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:28,050
I called it "dream in the wind."

1645
01:47:31,310 --> 01:47:34,810
Later we found out
the big fleet is out there.

1646
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:36,810
You can just take a boat
and go there.

1647
01:47:36,810 --> 01:47:39,730
They take everybody.

1648
01:47:39,730 --> 01:47:42,580
If you can get out there,
you're on board.

1649
01:47:45,990 --> 01:47:48,530
And I just didn't know that.

1650
01:47:48,530 --> 01:47:51,210
You know, so...

1651
01:48:03,670 --> 01:48:06,270
<font color="#ffff00">JACOBS</font>: As we approached the
Philippines with our refugees,

1652
01:48:06,270 --> 01:48:08,760
there was a big problem.

1653
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:10,590
They wouldn't let us in.

1654
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:13,510
And the reason
they wouldn't let us in is

1655
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:15,110
because the government there
had recognized

1656
01:48:15,110 --> 01:48:17,310
the new regime in Vietnam

1657
01:48:17,310 --> 01:48:20,190
and these Navy ships
we were escorting,

1658
01:48:20,190 --> 01:48:24,270
they were all flying
South Vietnamese flags.

1659
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:28,450
And the solution was to reflag
all these ships

1660
01:48:28,450 --> 01:48:31,950
as American ships.

1663
01:49:24,250 --> 01:49:28,710
<font color="#ffff00">JACOBS</font>: They lowered their
Vietnamese flag, people crying.

1664
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:31,010
It was very emotional for them
to lose their country,

1665
01:49:31,010 --> 01:49:32,430
their flag, their ship.

1666
01:49:32,430 --> 01:49:36,350
Everything was gone.

1667
01:49:36,350 --> 01:49:38,190
And then we raised
the American flag.

1668
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:41,480
We tried to do that with
as much dignity as we could.

1669
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:55,080
<font color="#ffff00">HERRINGTON</font>: There were thousands
and thousands of Americans

1670
01:49:55,080 --> 01:50:00,040
who sewed in Vietnam who were
sitting at home heartbroken

1671
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:04,210
at watching this whole thing
come to naught.

1672
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:12,720
The end of April of 1975 was...

1673
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:16,640
the whole Vietnam involvement
in microcosm...

1674
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:19,560
Promises made
in good faith, promises broken;

1675
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:25,730
People being hurt because
we didn't get our act together.

1676
01:50:25,730 --> 01:50:27,070
You know, the whole Vietnam War

1677
01:50:27,070 --> 01:50:30,610
is a story that kind of
sounds like that.

1678
01:50:30,610 --> 01:50:35,160
But on the other hand,
sometimes there are moments

1679
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:38,370
when good people have to rise
to the occasion

1680
01:50:38,370 --> 01:50:40,920
and do the things
that need to be done.

1681
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:45,460
And in Saigon, there was
no shortage of people like that.
