Whatever my father says,

358
00:34:00,794 --> 00:34:04,197
I can't bring myself
to trust these pagans.

359
00:34:04,198 --> 00:34:09,001
Their way of life is crude,
primitive, ignorant.

360
00:34:09,002 --> 00:34:12,872
They have not been redeemed
by our savior's love and sacrifice.

361
00:34:12,873 --> 00:34:15,907
They are like the...
creatures of the fields.

362
00:34:17,277 --> 00:34:20,012
I too loved someone
in the same way once.

363
00:34:21,081 --> 00:34:22,682
I sat among the reeds,

364
00:34:22,683 --> 00:34:25,985
waiting and waiting for my love.

365
00:34:25,986 --> 00:34:28,755
I prized that woman as
much as my own life.

366
00:34:29,257 --> 00:34:31,390
Lot of good it did me.

367
00:34:31,391 --> 00:34:34,704
And what do you get from
sitting in the reeds,

368
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:36,228
but a wet arse.

(LAUGHING)

370
00:34:37,766 --> 00:34:41,969
I would say, let no man mock
another over what touches many men.

371
00:34:43,638 --> 00:34:47,007
Time and again the wise
are fettered by beauty.

372
00:34:47,008 --> 00:34:49,743
They ache with love-longing.

373
00:34:49,744 --> 00:34:52,646

374
00:34:52,647 --> 00:34:54,682

One day will come a reckoning.

379
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,465
It is just not possible
to imagine a world

380

one god and several.
