00:00:57,381 --> 00:01:00,179
[Frank] Eight months is a long time
to be engaged, Major Houlihan.

2
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:04,244
- <i>[Hawkeye] Pickups without teeth.</i>
- It's hardly your affair, Major Burns.

3
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:06,812
An affair is an affair
is an affair.

4
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:09,655
- [B.J.] Who wrote that, Hawk?
- Gertrude Stein to Alice B. Toklas...

5
00:01:09,727 --> 00:01:11,786
on a piece of brown paper bag.

6
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:14,797
- I understand they were very close.
- <i>Oh, yes.</i>

7
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:18,426
They wrote together, traveled together
and gave each other German haircuts.

8
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:20,436
That's two pieces
of shrapnel.

9
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:23,632
Personally, I think your Colonel
Penobscott's full of banana oil.

10
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:27,871
Not intending to pry, Major,
but has your wedding date been set?

11
00:01:27,945 --> 00:01:30,743
- Not yet, Father.
- No ring. No wedding date.

12
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:34,148
I think it's, uh,
"Thanks for the buggy ride."

13
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:37,483
- Burns, why don't you get off
Major Houlihan's back?
- [B.J.] More sponges.

14
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,819
I'm sure Major Houlihan's
colonel is sincere.

15
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,654
- Oh, for God's sake!
- That's what I had in mind.

16
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:45,786
Frank, do I hear a little wave
of jealousy drifting through O.R.?

17
00:01:45,863 --> 00:01:48,627
Jealous? How could I be jealous?
I'm a married man.

18
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:50,687
- <i>[Margaret] Hah!</i>
- I heard that "Hah."

19
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,015
Will someone please
change the subject?

20
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:56,525
- Why, did it wet itself?
- I read that a Japanese businessman...

21
00:01:56,593 --> 00:02:00,359
while playing golf in a rainstorm,
was struck by lightning in his zipper.

22
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,091
Shocking.

23
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:04,360
Medically speaking,
he had his zip zapped.

24
00:02:04,434 --> 00:02:06,527
- Was he all right?
- <i>Oh, he's fine.</i>

25
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:10,061
Ever since his accident, he's been crazy
about "Stormy Weather."

27

## [All Join In]

28
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:22,341
L-I think we're getting him.
Uh, Colonel Penobscott?

29
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:24,614
- Yes, sir. It's Major Houlihan calling.
- You got him? Here!

30
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:26,986
- You got him. Right.
- Donald? Donald?

31
00:02:27,057 --> 00:02:28,991
- Why don't you sit...
- Oh, no, I'm fine.

32
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:31,459
- I just wanted to talk to you, darling.
- You have...

33
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:34,554
I know I could have written.
Oh, it's so good to hear your voice.

34
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:36,565
Well, did you get
Mr. Hotsy Totsy on the phone?

35
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:38,726
- This is personal. Please leave.
- I'm here on business.

36
00:02:38,802 --> 00:02:40,861
- Have you got those papers I asked for?
- Papers?

37
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:42,928
- I'll find them myself.
- My monthly report!

38
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:47,102
Donald, I've been talking to a friend,
and this friend suggests...

39
00:02:47,177 --> 00:02:49,270
- and I agree...
- Time to get a few things straightened out.

40
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:51,576
That it's time to get
a few things straightened out.

41
00:02:51,648 --> 00:02:53,582
- Time to set the date.
- It's time to set the date.

42
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,118
- No, I realize you're busy, dear.
- Sure he's busy.

43
00:02:56,186 --> 00:02:58,677
- Fraternizing with bathhouse bimbos.
- What's a bathhouse bimbo?

44
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:00,689
Start not listening for a change.
Do you hear me?

45
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:02,691
- Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir! Right.
- Shut up!

46
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,818
Who is this friend?
No, I don't mind telling you that.

47
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,828
- No names!
- Major Frank Burns.

48
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:09,990
- Ooh! You're scrunching my report.
- That's right. Yes.

49
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,091
- That Frank Burns.
- You're scrunching... Could you just...

50
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:15,763
- You will? Oh, Donald, that's wonderful!
- Could I just...

51
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:19,104
- I can hardly wait to see you! Bye!
- It took me a whole...

52
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:21,507
- Frank, you did it! You've done it!
- Did what?

53
00:03:21,578 --> 00:03:24,274
- Did what?
- He's coming here. He wants to talk to you.

54
00:03:24,347 --> 00:03:27,145
- What do you mean?
- He's coming here. He's on his way... Donald.

55
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:29,879
- Here? Penobscott's coming here? To MASH?
- Yes! Yes!

56
00:03:29,953 --> 00:03:32,854
He said he wants to
straighten things out once and for all.

57
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:35,322
- Ease up, please. Look what you did.
- [Whimpers]

58
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:38,452
Sir, can I have
two weeks' furlough?

59
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:41,520
- No.
- Oh, golly.

60
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:44,099
- Klinger!
- Pass off, Klinger.
You're always hogging the ball.

61
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:46,601
- That's no way to talk to a lady.
- It's a habit, guys.

62
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:49,900
In Toledo, if you pass
the ball to somebody, they sell it.

63
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:53,141
- Let go, you crumb!
- [Whistle Blowing]

64
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:55,769
- Oh, sorry, Father.
- You fouled him, Colonel!

65
00:03:55,845 --> 00:03:58,780
Radar, you wanna reorganize
the entire filing system?

66
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,749
- Jump ball!
- Isn't it unusual for the ref
to change his call?

67
00:04:01,818 --> 00:04:03,786
Not if he's a corporal.

68
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:06,048
Colonel, l-I believe
you're standing on my foot.

69
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:08,818
- It's only a friendly game, Father.
- [Whistle Blows]

00:04:08,892 --> 00:04:11,793
[Klinger] Get it, B. J!
Get it! Get it!

Lt. Col. Penobscott, sir.

[All]
Ah!

79
00:04:38,221 --> 00:04:40,712
- Sherman Potter. How do you do?
- A pleasure, sir.

80
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,724
- Captain Hunnicutt.
- Hi.

81
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:44,726
- Captain Pierce.
- Hello. How are you?

82
00:04:44,794 --> 00:04:47,661
- Lt. Peters. Father Mulcahy.
- Lieutenant. Father.

83
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,460
Corporal Klinger. Corporal O'Reilly.

84
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:52,467
Corporal.

85
00:04:56,706 --> 00:04:59,675
Lieutenant Colonel?

86
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:05,239
Major.

87
00:05:08,318 --> 00:05:10,286
Now there's
your regulation hug.

88
00:05:13,122 --> 00:05:15,249
Wow. They must really
like each other.

89
00:05:15,325 --> 00:05:17,259
Then how come
they close their eyes?

90
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:21,425
Oh. [Clears Throat]
Would you excuse us, Colonel, sir?

91
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:24,023
Of course.
Of course.

92
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,261
Gee, I'm so embarrassed.
I threw him the ball.

93
00:05:26,336 --> 00:05:29,066
It was very sportsmanlike.

94
00:05:29,138 --> 00:05:32,266
- Why don't we take a walk?
- Okay.

95
00:05:32,342 --> 00:05:36,802
[Mulcahy] Not being one to gossip, but
they seem like a nice-looking couple.

96
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,576
[Potter] Strapping young man.
Academy, you know.

97
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:43,210
- West Point or Arthur Murray?
- We gonna play ball anymore?
I was getting hot.

98
00:05:43,286 --> 00:05:45,311
Klinger, there's too much
human drama unfolding.

99
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:47,322
Geez, I wonder what they're
saying to each other.

100
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,621
She's saying, "Donald, darling, I'm not
getting any younger, you know."

101
00:05:50,693 --> 00:05:53,662
And he's saying, "Margaret, darling,
I couldn't love you more.

102
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,961
But I promised myself not to marry
until I made brigadier general."

103
00:05:57,033 --> 00:06:00,059
"Let's not rush into this thing like
a couple of crazy army kids."

104
00:06:00,136 --> 00:06:02,229
[Hawkeye] "Donald, darling,
I don't care what your rank is...

105
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:04,239
as long as it's
lieutenant colonel or better."

106
00:06:04,307 --> 00:06:06,332
[B.J.]
"Kiss me, you fool."

107
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:08,343
Amazing.
How'd you know that?

108
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:11,141
- She was puckering.
- All right. Knock off the eavesdropping.

109
00:06:11,214 --> 00:06:13,978
Let's go over
to the Mess Tent for a cup of joe.

the major and the colonel some coffee.

113
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:34,396
- I'd be proud to.
- Oh, no, thanks. Not now, Klinger.

114
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,429
Lt. Col. Penobscott has a little bomb
to drop on all of you.

115
00:06:38,508 --> 00:06:40,635
- How poetic.
- I haven't been bombed in a week.

116
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,508
I don't know
how to say this, but, uh...

117
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,515
Major Houlihan and I would like
to get married as soon as possible.

Why don't we toast
the happy couple?

They're too big
for our toaster.

121
00:06:53,856 --> 00:06:57,758
We'd like to expedite our marriage because
I'm due back in Tokyo in 48 hours.

122
00:06:57,827 --> 00:06:59,317
- Father Mulcahy.
- Present.

123
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:00,885
Will you join us in wedlock?

124
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:02,829
Don't do it, Father.
Three's a crowd.

125
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:05,367
I'd be honored
to marry you.

126
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:08,336
- I'm gonna cry. I know I'm gonna cry.
- Steady, soldier.

00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:10,804
Colonel, uh,
what's the procedure?

128
00:07:10,873 --> 00:07:13,467
- Radar?
- Uh, there's nothing to it, sir.

129
00:07:13,543 --> 00:07:18,071
All you need is permission from your
commanding officer and Form 1027 A.

130
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:21,844
Uh, then you need your overseas nuptials
in a combat zone...

131
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:23,852
Form 1136.

132
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,981
And then, uh,
your embassy registration... Form L1101.

133
00:07:28,057 --> 00:07:30,890
All typed up nice and neat
in triplicate.

134
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,827
- Don't forget the blood test.
- And then I marry you.

135
00:07:33,896 --> 00:07:36,694
- Father, do you do Methodist?
- Piece of cake.

136
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,996
Oh, right. Klinger, we'll need a cake.
Radar, warm up those forms.

137
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:42,799
- Yes, sir. Here. You're in charge of that.
- My first command.

138
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:45,432
- Morning, Major Burns.
- Morning.

139
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,874
- Major Frank Burns?
- Yes, sir?

140
00:07:47,944 --> 00:07:49,673
No, sir.

141
00:07:49,746 --> 00:07:52,214
That's him.
That's Frank Burns.

- Hold it. I wanna talk to you.
- [Margaret] Donald!

144
00:08:01,758 --> 00:08:04,454
Father, do you do
Presbyterian funerals?

145
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:13,929
I'm innocent! I never touched the girl!
I'm a happily married man!

146
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:16,437
- Hold still, Major!
- I don't know what anyone's told you...

147
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:19,669
but all we did was play chess,
make chains out of rubber bands.

148
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:22,540
And last Christmas,
we made little pussycat cookies.

149

Major Burns, at ease!

150
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:28,415

how grateful I am to you.

- What?
- It's your fault I'm here.

152

You inspired Margaret
into insisting we get married.

158
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:55,335
Uh, Captain Pierce and Hunnicutt
wanna give Colonel Penobscott a smoker.

159
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:57,811
Good. Good. Did you tell them
no horsing around...

160
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,814
in class "A" uniforms
at the wedding?

161
00:08:59,882 --> 00:09:02,373
Yes, sir. Captain Pierce says
he's gonna be on his best behavior...

162
00:09:02,452 --> 00:09:05,580
- but he won't wear pants.
- You tell him no pants, no champagne.

163
00:09:05,655 --> 00:09:08,283
You gotta know how
to handle these guys. What else?

164
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:10,291
Cook baked a cake.
Chocolate frosting.

165
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:13,988
- Mmm! Has anybody licked... Oh. Go on.
- I licked the spoon.

166

Probably want her real clean
for the wedding.

168

- I know.

169

This your first
marriage ceremony, Radar?

170
00:09:23,673 --> 00:09:25,607
Oh, no, sir.
I was at my Uncle Ernie's.

171
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:28,041

- Oh, yeah. They had potato salad...

172

punch, turkey...

Jell-O, tongue sandwiches
and chopped liver.

need anybody else to scratch it. Thanks.

188

I had to iron this dress.

- Keep it moving, Father.

Stat. Come on. Take him.

333
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:57,792
Okay, it's his leg.
Do a sterile prep. Move it! Hurry!

334
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:00,772
Pack his chest. He's in pain.
M.S., one-quarter.

335

He'll be next in O.R. Come on.

Fractured femur,
and the other has abdominal wounds.

- More whole blood!

- Wow!
- What do you got, B.J.?

341
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:21,150
- Belly full of shrapnel.
- Me too. It's beanbag time.

342
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,525
Ready to close.
General closure, but a peritoneum.

- Klinger.
- Captain?

344
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,655
Get that fractured leg
in here.

345
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,600
Gimme a second.
I'll bring the whole guy in.

How's your head?

347
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,105
Oh, it's okay, Father.
I got a little shook up.

348
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,233
Colonel, I don't think
this is a good idea.

349
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,470
No, I insist.
I want to see Margaret at work.

350
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,843
It'll bring us
closer together.

351
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:47,510
But if you're not used to it,
O.R. Can be very frightening.

352

I remember
my first experience.
