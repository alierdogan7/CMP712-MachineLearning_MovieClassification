1
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,755
It's hard to remember now,
but Europe was like this in 1944.

2
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,012
The Second World War
was in its fifth year...

3
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,515
...and still going Hitler's way.

4
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,226
German troops
controlled most of Europe.

5
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:04,231
D-Day changed all that.

6
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:09,528
D-Day: June 6, 1944...

7
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:13,907
...when the Allied forces, under
their commander General Eisenhower...

8
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,202
...landed on the northern
coast of France.

9
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,205
By July they were able
to begin their own offensive.

10
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:23,917
By August, Paris was liberated.

11
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,922
Everywhere the Germans retreated.

12
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,926
But with the Allied victories
came problems.

13
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:37,556
Supplies still had to be driven
from Normandy, over 400 miles away...

14
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,017
...and became dangerously short.

15
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,311
The Allied advance
began to come to a halt.

16
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:48,609
Another problem
facing Eisenhower was this:

17
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:52,070
His two most famous generals...
Patton, who was in the south...

18
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:56,784
...and Montgomery in the north...
disliked each other intensely.

19
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,538
The longstanding rivalry
had never been more fierce.

20
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:05,000
There simply were not
enough supplies for both armies.

21
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:08,337
Each wanted to be the one
to defeat the Germans.

22
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:11,423
Each wanted to beat
the other to Berlin.

23
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,551
In September, 1944...

24
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,221
Montgomery devised
a new and spectacular plan...

25
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,390
...given the code name
"Market Garden."

26
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,811
Eisenhower, under great pressure
from his superiors...

27
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,313
...finally sided with Montgomery...

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,234
...and Operation Market Garden
became a reality.

29
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,323
The plan, like so many plans
in so many wars before it...

30
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,035
...was meant to end
the fighting by Christmas...

31
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,955
...and bring the boys back home.

32
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,263
What is that noise?

33
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:35,104
- Can I look out?
- No, they might shoot us.

34
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,738
The Germans have collapsed.

35
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,286
Then the war is over?

36
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,622
Soon.

37
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:55,208
But what is that noise?

38
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,087
Panic.

39
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:11,909
You may begin.

40
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:16,205
May I first be permitted to say,
and I think I speak for all of us...

41
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:19,292
...how pleased we are,
Field Marshal Von Rundstedt...

42
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:22,086
...that you have been reappointed
commander of our forces in the West.

43
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:24,297
Speeches are for
victory celebrations.

44
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:27,258
Let's get to the point.
Air power?

45
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,969
Air power, Field Marshal?

46
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:31,345
Briefly, please.

47
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:35,308
- Air power is minimal.
- Ammunition?

48
00:08:35,475 --> 00:08:37,018
Also minimal.

49
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:39,270
Tanks... Troops...
Replacements?

50
00:08:39,437 --> 00:08:40,980
- Minimal.
- Morale?

51
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:53,284
Nonexistent.

52
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:57,497
What do you think
we should do?

53
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,209
End the war, you fools.

54
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:05,421
- Why in the world are you laughing?
- Excuse us.

55
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:07,799
We have such confidence in you.

56
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,343
Everyone knows you have
never lost a battle.

57
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:15,681
I'm still young.
Give me time.

58
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:21,604
The first thing we must do...

59
00:09:21,771 --> 00:09:25,983
...is to turn this rabble
into something like an army.

60
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:33,366
Anything at all on when
they plan to invade Holland?

61
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,120
They seem to have
paused in Belgium.

62
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:40,164
Most likely supply problems.

63
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:42,250
Otherwise we can't imagine why.

64
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:49,465
I think it's because
we're retreating...

65
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:52,010
...faster than they can advance.

66
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,835
How many vehicles
in the past hour?

67
00:10:26,044 --> 00:10:28,296
Fifty-four.

68
00:10:28,463 --> 00:10:31,174
And for the same hour yesterday?

69
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:33,468
Ninety-eight.

70
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:37,847
Last week your mother and I
could have captured Holland alone.

71
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:41,100
Already the panic has stopped.

72
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:44,979
It isn't over yet
and those idiots don't realize it.

73
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:48,608
- War takes time.
- Listen to the expert.

74
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:50,610
I was nine when they got here.

75
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:53,696
Next month I'll be 14.
I ought to know something.

76
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:00,620
Father, the Allies will come?

77
00:11:03,623 --> 00:11:05,541
But when?

78
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,508
I've just got back to England
from Brussels...

79
00:11:13,675 --> 00:11:17,679
...where I had a meeting this morning
with Field Marshal Montgomery.

80
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,056
There was an earlier one
with General Eisenhower.

81
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:23,142
They both feel, as I do...

82
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:25,937
...that when the Field Marshal's plan
has succeeded...

83
00:11:26,104 --> 00:11:28,564
...we should be able
to end the war by Christmas...

84
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:30,733
...in less than 100 days.

85
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:35,863
Actually, the plan
is really very simple.

86
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,370
We're going to fly 35,000 men 300 miles,
and drop them behind enemy lines.

87
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:47,375
It'll be the largest
airborne operation ever mounted.

88
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,507
Quite frankly, this kind of thing's
never been attempted before.

89
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:59,220
- Where's this all going to take place?
- Holland.

90
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:02,223
- And when?
- I'm coming to that now.

91
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:04,559
Right.

92
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:11,524
The ground forces: 30 Corps, commanded
by General Horrocks, 20,000 vehicles.

93
00:12:11,691 --> 00:12:15,111
And this, as you know,
is the German front line.

94
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,823
Now we're going to lay a carpet,
as it were, of airborne troops...

95
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,200
...over which 30th Corps can pass.

96
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:25,079
We shall seize the bridges...
it's all a question of bridges...

97
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:27,290
With thunderclap surprise...

98
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:30,126
...and hold them until
they can be secured.

99
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,547
Now first of all,
General Maxwell Taylor...

100
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:37,258
...Eindhoven.

101
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:41,179
You take and hold
the bridges there with 101 st.

102
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:46,267
General Gavin,
with your 82nd...

103
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:48,311
...you get Nijmegen.

104
00:12:48,478 --> 00:12:50,313
You take and hold the bridges.

105
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,566
And Roy, you get the prize:
Arnhem.

106
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,902
Arnhem Bridge.

107
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:59,864
- And you hold it.
- For how long?

108
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:02,909
Monty assures me that 30 Corps...

109
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:07,455
...will do the 63 miles
in two days.

110
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:10,667
Sixty-three miles in two days.

111
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,711
- They oughta be able to handle that.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

112
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:18,049
General Sosabowski, you go with
your Polish Brigade with Roy Urquhart.

113
00:13:18,216 --> 00:13:19,759
I'm so sorry.

114
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:22,095
Roy...

115
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:25,932
...when you've secured
your bridge...

116
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,477
...and 30th Corps have got across it,
we can turn east...

117
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:33,314
...right into the industrial heart
of Germany... the Ruhr.

118
00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:36,776
Once we control their factories,
there's not much they can do about it.

119
00:13:36,943 --> 00:13:39,404
And that is the plan.

120
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:42,240
And we go next Sunday.

121
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:43,825
Seven days?

122
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:46,786
Why not?
The sooner we go, the better.

123
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:49,038
We've got them on the run.

124
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,294
Is something troubling you,
General Sosabowski?

125
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:58,423
- I've said nothing.
- Precisely.

126
00:13:59,132 --> 00:14:01,259
Your silences are thunderous.

127
00:14:05,263 --> 00:14:07,223
General Browning, I...

128
00:14:08,308 --> 00:14:10,184
I am a Pole...

129
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:13,396
...considered by some
to be smart.

130
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:15,106
If that is so...

131
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:19,152
...it makes me member
of a true minority group.

132
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:22,614
Minority groups
are more comfortable in silence.

133
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,784
I should have thought the opposite
was true. But you do disapprove?

134
00:14:26,993 --> 00:14:30,622
I am thrilled that your great Field
Marshal Montgomery has devised a plan.

135
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,958
I promise you, I'll be
properly ecstatic if it works.

136
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,001
When it works.

137
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:37,587
Of course.
When it works.

138
00:14:37,754 --> 00:14:39,255
Thank you.

139
00:14:41,174 --> 00:14:43,885
Well, now let's
get down to the details.

140
00:14:44,677 --> 00:14:46,638
First we shall have to have...

141
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:49,807
From which direction will their
attack come, and who will command?

142
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:51,893
Montgomery or Patton?

143
00:14:53,436 --> 00:14:55,647
- Model, what do you think?
- Patton.

144
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:58,816
He is their best.

145
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:01,361
Patton will lead the assault.

146
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:04,572
I would prefer Montgomery...

147
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:07,158
...but even Eisenhower
isn't that stupid.

148
00:15:10,912 --> 00:15:13,331
Bittrich's panzer troops
need some rest...

149
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,126
...if they're to stop Patton.

150
00:15:17,293 --> 00:15:21,506
We should pull them back
somewhere safe.

151
00:15:21,673 --> 00:15:25,593
Safe, quiet, out of the way.
But where?

152
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,303
Arnhem?

153
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,144
Arnhem.

154
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,230
- I'll be in touch.
- That'll be fine.

155
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:42,819
Why the emergency meeting?

156
00:15:42,986 --> 00:15:46,865
- Keeping abreast of the little changes.
- How big are the little changes?

157
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:50,326
I'll answer you with typical
British understatement: gigantic.

158
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:52,328
They can't get us
all in at once.

159
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:54,998
Too many men, too much equipment,
not enough planes.

160
00:15:55,165 --> 00:15:59,669
It's going to take three days to get the
men into Arnhem, Poles and the British.

161
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:01,838
- How about us?
- We'll be all right.

162
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:05,842
Aside from the fact that we'll parachute
in daylight, we have no worries.

163
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:07,719
Daylight?

164
00:16:07,886 --> 00:16:11,514
- Has it ever been tried before?
- Not in a major drop.

165
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:15,059
- Think there might be a reason for that?
- Let's hope not.

166
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:17,061
- What do you think?
- It'll be all right.

167
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:20,148
It's a "no moon" period anyway.
We have to go in daylight.

168
00:16:20,315 --> 00:16:22,984
Just so they get us over
the target area, half a mile away.

169
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:25,069
Three-quarters of a mile...
I'll settle for that.

170
00:16:25,236 --> 00:16:27,739
I don't want to hear anything else.

171
00:16:27,906 --> 00:16:31,534
- Is there anything else?
- Well, you're my Dutch advisor, Harry.

172
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:33,620
I forgot to tell you something?

173
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:36,456
Only that the Germans first tried
to take Nijmegen Bridge themselves...

174
00:16:36,623 --> 00:16:39,876
...back in 1940,
and got slaughtered.

175
00:16:45,298 --> 00:16:46,841
Go back!

176
00:16:49,636 --> 00:16:51,095
Go back!

177
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:54,390
Do as I say!

178
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:57,894
But my friend lives
down the road.

179
00:16:59,104 --> 00:17:02,273
It's my birthday
and she has a present for me.

180
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:05,902
Please let me through.

181
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:15,161
All right. Be quick.

182
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:28,216
Are you sure about the colors?

183
00:17:28,425 --> 00:17:30,760
I'm sure, Father.
Believe me.

184
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:35,265
Model?

185
00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:39,561
A field marshal in Arnhem? Why?

186
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:42,897
The British will have
an explanation.

187
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:44,899
Did you pass on
the message about the tanks?

188
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:47,944
Of course. But Model is
something more important.

189
00:17:49,571 --> 00:17:52,574
You're a good boy
and a wonderful spy.

190
00:17:52,782 --> 00:17:55,160
Now go and help
your mother with supper.

191
00:17:58,913 --> 00:18:01,916
- Sir?
- Yes, Fuller?

192
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:04,169
- We've got some information on tanks.
- What?

193
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:06,546
Dutch Underground reports
from the Arnhem area.

194
00:18:06,713 --> 00:18:09,132
- Established their strength?
- No, sir, but I've got...

195
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,926
- Have they been identified?
- Not by our intelligence, sir.

196
00:18:12,093 --> 00:18:14,429
So it's the same rumors
as before, right?

197
00:18:14,596 --> 00:18:17,223
- I believe these rumors, sir.
- Why?

198
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,642
The general consensus of opinion
is that our opposition...

199
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:22,437
...will consist entirely of Hitler Youth
or old men on bicycles.

200
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:24,439
I don't really know why, sir.

201
00:18:24,647 --> 00:18:26,983
Perhaps because no one
in Intelligence does.

202
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,903
I just want to be sure
our airborne carpet...

203
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,073
...consists of live troops,
not dead ones.

204
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:36,618
I know everybody thinks
I'm overanxious, sir...

205
00:18:36,785 --> 00:18:39,954
...but I would like to order another
low-level reconnaissance of the area.

206
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:42,624
If that's all right
with you, sir.

207
00:18:44,918 --> 00:18:46,336
Very well.

208
00:18:47,337 --> 00:18:49,005
All right, Wilson.

209
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:50,757
Very well.

210
00:18:53,426 --> 00:18:57,430
I wouldn't be too concerned
about what people think of you.

211
00:18:57,639 --> 00:19:01,142
You happen to be somewhat
brighter than most of us.

212
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:03,395
Tends to make us nervous.

213
00:19:14,614 --> 00:19:17,659
Naturally we'll do our utmost
to meet your tactical requirements, sir.

214
00:19:17,826 --> 00:19:19,703
But please keep in mind...

215
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:23,039
...the one factor which is
crippling all our plans.

216
00:19:23,206 --> 00:19:25,291
It may seem improbable to you...

217
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,336
...but we are desperately short
of transport aircraft.

218
00:19:28,503 --> 00:19:29,629
I am aware of that.

219
00:19:29,796 --> 00:19:33,341
I was surprised that nobody mentioned it
to Monty when he dreamed up this plan.

220
00:19:34,342 --> 00:19:37,387
I need drop zones as close
as possible to the bridge.

221
00:19:37,554 --> 00:19:39,514
This area's no use at all.

222
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:44,185
Can't have my chaps landing on chimney
tops, but this looks inviting here.

223
00:19:44,352 --> 00:19:47,022
- What's the terrain like?
- Sorry, sir.

224
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:50,859
Our reports indicate that this terrain
is too soft for glider landings.

225
00:19:51,026 --> 00:19:53,903
The nose digs in first on touchdown,
the thing goes ass over tip.

226
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,114
Total write-off.

227
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:57,782
All right.

228
00:19:57,991 --> 00:19:59,993
- What about there?
- Afraid not, sir.

229
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:02,996
You see, after the drop,
when we bank for our return...

230
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:04,998
...we run into
a whole lot of flak...

231
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:08,001
...from this Jerry airfield
up here at Deelen.

232
00:20:08,168 --> 00:20:10,920
Presumably you're intending
to let us land somewhere?

233
00:20:12,672 --> 00:20:14,507
Oh, yes.
Hopefully, sir.

234
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:19,304
But as I was saying, we cannot afford
to lose a single aircraft.

235
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:21,306
That is the problem.

236
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:25,060
My problem is,
I don't just need drop zones.

237
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:28,313
I need drop zones
I can hold and defend.

238
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,899
The rest of my division arrives
with the second drop...

239
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:33,777
...and General Sosabowski's
Polish Brigade with the third.

240
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:37,489
I understand, sir, but we really
think we've found the right place.

241
00:20:37,656 --> 00:20:41,034
It's large enough for your needs,
it's flat and firm.

242
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:44,037
- It's also easily defended.
- Where the hell is it?

243
00:20:44,204 --> 00:20:47,374
Well, it's not actually
on this photograph.

244
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,709
It should be...
Excuse me, sir...

245
00:20:49,876 --> 00:20:52,921
It would be about here,
I think.

246
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:57,717
That could be
ten miles from the bridge.

247
00:20:57,884 --> 00:21:01,137
It's just under eight actually, sir,
if you'd like to have a look at this.

248
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:07,352
You see, the terrain
is easy to traverse.

249
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,189
All our information
substantiates that.

250
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,692
Yes, sir?

251
00:21:14,693 --> 00:21:17,570
Just making sure
whose side you're on.

252
00:22:07,954 --> 00:22:11,082
Now, a drop zone
eight miles from Arnhem Bridge...

253
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:13,543
...might be thought by some
to present problems.

254
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,629
My God, he can't mean it.

255
00:22:15,795 --> 00:22:19,215
I'm afraid he does.
Must know what he's doing.

256
00:22:19,382 --> 00:22:22,844
That's more than I know. Why should
he have a corner on the market?

257
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:26,932
...cannot under any stretch
of the imagination be considered ideal.

258
00:22:27,098 --> 00:22:31,019
But the gliders will be bringing in
a reconnaissance squadron of jeeps...

259
00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:34,230
...specially fitted
with twin Vickers machine guns.

260
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:37,776
The instant we land,
they will race ahead to the bridge...

261
00:22:37,943 --> 00:22:39,444
...and hold it...

262
00:22:39,611 --> 00:22:42,030
...until the other battalions
arrive on foot.

263
00:22:42,197 --> 00:22:44,658
And they'll be quick enough
to secure both ends of Arnhem Bridge?

264
00:22:44,824 --> 00:22:46,868
- Most certainly.
- Good.

265
00:22:47,035 --> 00:22:50,956
My headquarters will be
in the center with 82nd.

266
00:22:51,122 --> 00:22:53,625
Now, just you remember that
we're all totally interlocked.

267
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:55,752
This is a bottom-to-top operation.

268
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,172
101 st pass 30 Corps
on to 82nd.

269
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:02,592
82nd pass them on
to British Airborne.

270
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:05,470
If any one group fails,
it's total failure for us all.

271
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:11,810
All we need now
are three days of clear skies.

272
00:23:11,977 --> 00:23:13,979
Thank you, gentlemen,
very much.

273
00:23:15,689 --> 00:23:17,941
Only the weather
can stop us now.

274
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,402
<i>Weather! Cristos! </i>

275
00:23:25,323 --> 00:23:28,618
What of the Germans?
Don't you think that since we know...

276
00:23:28,827 --> 00:23:31,538
...that Arnhem is so crucial to their
safety, they might know that too?

277
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:33,081
Now look here.

278
00:23:33,248 --> 00:23:35,876
The few troops
in the area are...

279
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:38,295
...second class.

280
00:23:38,461 --> 00:23:40,422
They're not front-line caliber.

281
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,799
Not at all.
Do you understand?

282
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:46,678
You ought to have more faith
in Montgomery's intelligence reports.

283
00:23:46,845 --> 00:23:49,514
He's done pretty well for us
in the last three or four years.

284
00:23:49,681 --> 00:23:51,433
I will tell you
the extent of my faith.

285
00:23:53,643 --> 00:23:55,520
I'm thinking of asking
for a letter from you...

286
00:23:55,687 --> 00:23:58,481
...stating that I was forced
to act on your orders...

287
00:23:58,648 --> 00:24:01,359
...in case my men are massacred.

288
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:04,070
I see.

289
00:24:05,906 --> 00:24:08,325
Yes, I do see.

290
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:13,455
Do you wish such a letter?

291
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,753
Of course not.

292
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,632
In the case of massacre,
what difference would it make?

293
00:24:34,976 --> 00:24:37,521
- You don't believe me, sir?
- Clearly not.

294
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:40,273
All right, boys, Naafi's up.
Take your break.

295
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,527
God Almighty!

296
00:24:43,693 --> 00:24:46,404
Sorry about that, sir.
But what then?

297
00:24:46,571 --> 00:24:48,698
I just don't believe these
damn radios are strong enough...

298
00:24:48,865 --> 00:24:51,743
...to carry the eight miles
from the drop zone to Arnhem Bridge.

299
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,621
Don't happen to have
any cigarettes, do you, sir?

300
00:24:54,788 --> 00:24:58,166
They're perfectly okay.
I've used them God knows how many times.

301
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:00,961
You've already told me that
God knows how many times.

302
00:25:01,127 --> 00:25:04,339
Well, I didn't have any problems
with them in the desert.

303
00:25:04,506 --> 00:25:07,133
Yes, I know,
but you see, Cole...

304
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,179
...what genuinely and truly has me more
than a bit disturbed is that Holland...

305
00:25:11,346 --> 00:25:15,684
...being half underwater, is soggier
than most deserts you're apt to find.

306
00:25:17,185 --> 00:25:19,354
Tends to have
a lot more trees.

307
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:22,357
- Any biscuits?
- Your biscuits are in your tin, sir.

308
00:25:23,984 --> 00:25:26,236
Shouldn't you tell the general
if you're so certain about it, sir?

309
00:25:26,403 --> 00:25:28,989
If I were,
believe me, I would.

310
00:25:29,197 --> 00:25:32,367
- What if they really don't work?
- What difference will it make?

311
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:35,036
The general will be on
the bridge himself by nightfall.

312
00:25:35,203 --> 00:25:38,665
He won't have to make contact with
the bridge if he's on it, will he, sir?

313
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:44,045
Well, if anyone
rocks the boat...

314
00:25:44,212 --> 00:25:46,131
...it's not gonna be me.

315
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:54,139
The regular projector chap's at lunch,
sir. I'll have it in a moment.

316
00:25:54,306 --> 00:25:57,851
You're doing splendidly, Fuller.
Don't worry. I don't need lunch.

317
00:25:58,894 --> 00:26:01,938
Damn. Nearly there, sir.

318
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:05,108
It's really worth your time, sir.
Believe me.

319
00:26:06,568 --> 00:26:08,028
There.

320
00:26:08,195 --> 00:26:11,072
Splendid view of the Dutch countryside.
Can't see any tanks.

321
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:14,993
Wait a moment, sir.
It's a lot clearer in the next picture.

322
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,995
If I can just...

323
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,123
Now.

324
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:24,711
- Next.
- Yes, sir.

325
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,088
I've had this one enlarged.

326
00:26:53,448 --> 00:26:55,617
I shouldn't worry about them.

327
00:26:57,869 --> 00:27:00,247
But, sir, you see
that they are tanks.

328
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,874
I doubt if they're
fully serviceable.

329
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,002
- Still got guns.
- So have we.

330
00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:09,631
But, sir...

331
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:14,302
...if they weren't serviceable,
why would they try to conceal them?

332
00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:17,139
Normal routine, Fuller.

333
00:27:17,305 --> 00:27:19,599
But, sir, we keep getting reports
from the Dutch Underground.

334
00:27:19,766 --> 00:27:23,979
I've read them!
And so has Field Marshal Montgomery.

335
00:27:24,146 --> 00:27:26,314
Now look here.

336
00:27:26,481 --> 00:27:29,443
There have been thousands of photographs
from this sortie and from the others.

337
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:33,447
- How many of them have shown tanks?
- Just these, sir.

338
00:27:33,613 --> 00:27:35,949
And you seriously consider
asking us to cancel...

339
00:27:36,116 --> 00:27:39,077
...the biggest operation
mounted since D-Day...

340
00:27:39,286 --> 00:27:41,955
...because of three photographs?

341
00:27:46,835 --> 00:27:47,836
No, sir.

342
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:51,131
Sixteen consecutive drops have been
cancelled in the last few months...

343
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:53,592
...for one reason or another.

344
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,344
But this time
the party's on...

345
00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:58,680
...and no one is going
to call it off.

346
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,476
Is that fully understood?

347
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,062
Yes, sir.

348
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,753
Thank you, Waddy.

349
00:28:32,464 --> 00:28:34,424
Thank you, gentlemen.

350
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:38,678
Do sit down, gentlemen.
Please sit down.

351
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:43,058
Look after these.

352
00:28:48,647 --> 00:28:51,108
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.

353
00:28:53,318 --> 00:28:57,739
Gentlemen, this is a story
that you will tell your grandchildren...

354
00:28:57,906 --> 00:28:59,825
...and mightily bored they'll be.

355
00:29:01,326 --> 00:29:04,538
The plan is called
Operation Market Garden.

356
00:29:04,705 --> 00:29:07,791
Market is the airborne element,
and Garden the ground forces...

357
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:09,334
That's us.

358
00:29:09,501 --> 00:29:14,089
Now this is our position
on the Belgian border here.

359
00:29:14,256 --> 00:29:18,677
Tomorrow, three airborne divisions
will begin landing in Holland...

360
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:22,014
Thirty-five thousand men
taking off from 24 airfields...

361
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,933
...in troop-carrying planes
or towed in gliders.

362
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,520
The American 101 st here...

363
00:29:28,687 --> 00:29:30,689
...around Eindhoven...

364
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:33,233
...the American 82nd here...

365
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,444
...south of Nijmegen...

366
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:39,114
...and our own 1 st Airborne boys
and a Polish brigade...

367
00:29:39,281 --> 00:29:41,491
...here at Arnhem...

368
00:29:41,658 --> 00:29:43,577
...sixty-four miles...

369
00:29:43,744 --> 00:29:45,662
...behind enemy lines.

370
00:29:47,914 --> 00:29:51,668
Now, their job
is to take and hold...

371
00:29:51,835 --> 00:29:54,796
...all the bridges
in these three areas.

372
00:29:55,005 --> 00:29:57,591
Our job is to punch a hole...

373
00:29:57,758 --> 00:30:00,385
...through the German
front line here...

374
00:30:00,552 --> 00:30:03,972
...and then drive like hell
up this road...

375
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:07,684
...linking up with each
airborne division on the way up.

376
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:12,689
Speed is the vital factor.

377
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:17,569
The plan is to reach Eindhoven
in two to three hours...

378
00:30:17,736 --> 00:30:20,614
...and Arnhem in two to three days.

379
00:30:21,365 --> 00:30:24,117
That, gentlemen,
is the prize:

380
00:30:24,284 --> 00:30:26,286
The bridge over the Rhine...

381
00:30:26,453 --> 00:30:29,581
...the last bridge
between us and Germany.

382
00:30:29,748 --> 00:30:33,710
Kickoff will be at 1435 hours
tomorrow afternoon.

383
00:30:33,877 --> 00:30:37,339
The Irish Guards, under the command of
Colonel Vandeleur, will take the lead.

384
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:40,258
- Christ, not us again.
- What do you say to that, Joe?

385
00:30:40,425 --> 00:30:43,637
Delighted, sir.
Truly delighted.

386
00:30:44,346 --> 00:30:46,139
I've selected you to lead us...

387
00:30:46,306 --> 00:30:49,393
...not only because of your
extraordinary fighting ability...

388
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,395
...but also because...

389
00:30:51,561 --> 00:30:54,231
...in the unlikely event
that the Germans ever get you...

390
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:57,943
...they'll assume from your attire that
they've captured a wretched peasant...

391
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,529
...and immediately
send you on your way.

392
00:31:04,074 --> 00:31:06,952
Now, maintaining
the speed of our advance...

393
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:11,206
...will no doubt be tough going,
as it's a single highway.

394
00:31:11,415 --> 00:31:12,874
But no matter what...

395
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:17,713
...we must reach those
1 st Airborne boys in 48 hours.

396
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:19,548
Now, gentlemen...

397
00:31:19,715 --> 00:31:22,384
...I'm not saying that this
will be the easiest party...

398
00:31:22,592 --> 00:31:24,594
...that we've ever attended...

399
00:31:24,761 --> 00:31:27,389
...but I still wouldn't
miss it for the world.

400
00:31:28,473 --> 00:31:30,642
I like to think of this...

401
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:34,104
...as one of those
American Western films.

402
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:37,816
The paratroops,
lacking substantial equipment...

403
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:39,818
...always short of food...

404
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:42,696
These are the
besieged homesteaders.

405
00:31:42,863 --> 00:31:46,116
The Germans...
well, naturally they're the bad guys.

406
00:31:46,283 --> 00:31:48,035
And 30 Corps...

407
00:31:48,201 --> 00:31:51,413
We, my friends,
are the cavalry...

408
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,207
...on the way to the rescue.

409
00:32:10,766 --> 00:32:13,477
Do you want me
to pack that as well, sir?

410
00:32:13,644 --> 00:32:16,563
No, thank you, Wicks.
I'll carry it.

411
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,900
You haven't forgotten
my golf clubs, have you?

412
00:32:20,108 --> 00:32:23,028
They'll be coming later
in the staff car, sir.

413
00:32:23,195 --> 00:32:24,905
And what about...

414
00:32:25,113 --> 00:32:26,907
Sorry, sir?

415
00:32:27,074 --> 00:32:29,284
What about my dinner jacket?

416
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:33,288
Are you sure you'll be
needing that, sir?

417
00:32:33,455 --> 00:32:35,374
Well, let's hope so.

418
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:41,213
Why don't you quit that?

419
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,257
Chock-full of vitamins.

420
00:32:43,423 --> 00:32:46,301
Here, Eddie.
Have a little strength.

421
00:32:51,306 --> 00:32:53,600
Hey, where'd you put that?

422
00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:56,770
- Damn it, Eddie, give it back.
- Right.

423
00:32:57,938 --> 00:32:59,648
There you are.

424
00:33:00,732 --> 00:33:02,985
I wish you hadn't done that.

425
00:33:05,487 --> 00:33:09,408
My problem is, I'm not totally crazy
about the prospect of dyin'.

426
00:33:09,575 --> 00:33:11,451
So don't die.

427
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:15,122
Drinkin' that garbage
isn't gonna keep you alive.

428
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:17,624
What is?

429
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,547
- Not gettin' shot.
- And what can guarantee that?

430
00:33:23,714 --> 00:33:26,174
Nothin', for sure.

431
00:33:29,845 --> 00:33:32,931
- You will.
- I will what?

432
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,768
You tell me, Eddie.
You tell me I won't die.

433
00:33:38,437 --> 00:33:39,897
All right, you won't die.

434
00:33:40,063 --> 00:33:42,608
No, no. Guarantee me.

435
00:33:42,816 --> 00:33:45,652
I want you to guarantee me
I won't die.

436
00:33:51,783 --> 00:33:54,286
I guarantee you.

437
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,677
Come on.
Let's get some food in you.

438
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,097
I wasn't kidding.

439
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:22,356
Hey, Eddie,
were you kidding?

440
00:34:23,774 --> 00:34:25,442
Major Fuller.

441
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:30,489
My name is Sims.
Mind a bit of company?

442
00:34:31,782 --> 00:34:33,700
Of course not, sir.

443
00:34:35,494 --> 00:34:37,830
Busy times.

444
00:34:37,996 --> 00:34:40,123
You must be exhausted.

445
00:34:43,126 --> 00:34:45,754
Are you exhausted?

446
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:48,298
Who isn't?

447
00:34:49,716 --> 00:34:53,595
We've been getting reports
from a number of your friends.

448
00:34:53,762 --> 00:34:57,724
They're worried about you.
They think perhaps you need a rest.

449
00:34:59,852 --> 00:35:03,272
We all need rest.
Why are you saying this to me?

450
00:35:05,691 --> 00:35:08,110
Is it because
I rocked the boat?

451
00:35:09,695 --> 00:35:13,866
I'm a doctor.
I'm only concerned with your health.

452
00:35:15,409 --> 00:35:19,204
I think perhaps you ought
to take a bit of sick leave.

453
00:35:20,372 --> 00:35:21,999
But why?

454
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,628
I'm not ill or anything.

455
00:35:29,006 --> 00:35:31,550
I haven't done anything wrong.

456
00:35:31,717 --> 00:35:34,803
Of course not.
You're just a little tired.

457
00:35:39,766 --> 00:35:41,518
I am tired.

458
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:48,859
I think perhaps we might go.

459
00:35:50,777 --> 00:35:52,237
Can't it be stopped?

460
00:35:57,159 --> 00:36:01,121
I don't want
to be left behind, please.

461
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,500
It's out of my hands, laddie.

462
00:36:17,638 --> 00:36:19,890
I didn't want to miss the party.

463
00:37:55,778 --> 00:37:58,322
Move it, buddy.
That's the way.

464
00:38:18,759 --> 00:38:21,136
Home, sweet home.

465
00:38:23,889 --> 00:38:28,060
When you think we only had seven days to
get everything organized, it's quite a...

466
00:38:28,227 --> 00:38:29,603
Boody miracle.

467
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:32,356
It took six months
to set up the D-Day drop...

468
00:38:32,523 --> 00:38:35,025
...and that was only
half as big as this.

469
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:38,445
- How do you feel?
- Fine.

470
00:38:38,612 --> 00:38:40,989
I'll feel even better
when we're in Holland.

471
00:38:42,032 --> 00:38:44,827
Do you remember when I was
appointed to this command...

472
00:38:44,993 --> 00:38:48,831
...I told you I had never jumped,
but thought I ought to give it a go?

473
00:38:48,997 --> 00:38:51,959
- Well, you did me a big favor.
- Really? What?

474
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:56,880
You said, "Roy, you're far too old for
that kind of thing, and much too large."

475
00:38:57,047 --> 00:38:59,258
Did I?
What was the favor?

476
00:38:59,425 --> 00:39:02,970
Well, I didn't quite tell you
everything at the time...

477
00:39:05,055 --> 00:39:07,307
...but I'm prone to airsickness.

478
00:39:07,516 --> 00:39:10,394
Good gracious.
What, every flight?

479
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,981
Well, we'll soon find out,
won't we?

480
00:39:42,801 --> 00:39:46,513
Go on! Get that
goddamn jeep outta here!

481
00:41:54,516 --> 00:41:59,563
<i>Who would true valor see</i>

482
00:41:59,772 --> 00:42:04,151
<i>Let him come hither</i>

483
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:09,281
<i>One here will constant be</i>

484
00:42:09,448 --> 00:42:13,535
<i>Come wind
Come weather</i>

485
00:42:13,702 --> 00:42:19,124
<i>There's no discouragement</i>

486
00:42:53,033 --> 00:42:54,994
Soon be home, Harry.

487
00:43:02,543 --> 00:43:06,088
- Better than the desert, eh, sir?
- What was that?

488
00:43:06,255 --> 00:43:08,132
Easier than walking, sir.

489
00:43:10,926 --> 00:43:13,137
If you say so, Hancock.

490
00:43:27,484 --> 00:43:29,486
Yeah, fine, sir.

491
00:43:32,656 --> 00:43:36,035
The artillery should be able to clear
the way very well. Your initial advance.

492
00:43:36,202 --> 00:43:39,163
Yes, we'll move off as soon
as their barrage has got going.

493
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:43,000
- Yes, that's absolutely fine.
- Follow behind it as close as we can.

494
00:43:43,792 --> 00:43:45,169
But you know...

495
00:43:45,336 --> 00:43:48,422
...this isn't gonna be the pushover
that everybody seems to think it is.

496
00:43:48,589 --> 00:43:51,133
No, I didn't think so.

497
00:43:51,342 --> 00:43:54,470
Morning, Alan. Your sleeping beauties
know there's a war on, do they?

498
00:43:54,678 --> 00:43:55,804
Absolutely, sir.

499
00:43:56,013 --> 00:43:59,058
Is it true that the Germans have put
more troops into the line ahead of us?

500
00:43:59,225 --> 00:44:02,645
Yes. They obviously don't intend
to just let us walk in the front door.

501
00:44:02,811 --> 00:44:06,273
Hello, Bob! Hope that's not
my funeral they're going to.

502
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:09,360
And I'm still
desperately worried...

503
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:11,570
...about having them throw
everything up this road.

504
00:44:11,737 --> 00:44:14,698
But there's no alternative.
Morning, Tom.

505
00:44:14,865 --> 00:44:17,660
So I've decided to run
the road like a railway.

506
00:44:17,826 --> 00:44:20,037
Nobody, repeat,
nobody will be allowed...

507
00:44:20,204 --> 00:44:23,165
...to put any vehicle on that road
without my permission.

508
00:44:23,332 --> 00:44:25,167
- Including me?
- Good luck to you!

509
00:44:25,334 --> 00:44:29,046
You too!
Especially you, Joe.

510
00:44:29,213 --> 00:44:30,798
Morning, Derek!

511
00:44:30,965 --> 00:44:33,425
Glad to see somebody
knows where we're going.

512
00:44:39,056 --> 00:44:42,268
Time, Joe.
That's the killer.

513
00:44:42,434 --> 00:44:45,020
We can't afford
to drop behind schedule.

514
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,192
So for God's sake,
keep your tanks on the move.

515
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:01,245
Good God Almighty.

516
00:45:02,246 --> 00:45:03,914
That's just the 101 st.

517
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:07,001
The other two groups
are on the northern route.

518
00:45:08,085 --> 00:45:10,421
H hour in 90 minutes.

519
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:13,090
- I'd better be going, sir.
- Right you are, Joe.

520
00:45:14,049 --> 00:45:16,552
- Any last-minute changes, Bob?
- Yes, sir.

521
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:19,972
If the advance runs into difficulty, we
call in the Air Force with purple smoke.

522
00:45:20,139 --> 00:45:22,892
First class.
And good luck, Joe!

523
00:45:23,058 --> 00:45:24,602
Thank you, sir.

524
00:45:24,768 --> 00:45:26,312
Think you'll be able
to manage it?

525
00:45:26,479 --> 00:45:29,899
I've got nothing else planned
for this afternoon.

526
00:46:37,883 --> 00:46:40,803
I told you you should have had
the bloody thing out.

527
00:46:57,945 --> 00:46:59,947
What the hell's that?

528
00:47:00,114 --> 00:47:02,032
It's flak.

529
00:47:08,664 --> 00:47:10,207
General Bittrich!

530
00:47:10,374 --> 00:47:12,376
In here, Matthias.

531
00:47:26,515 --> 00:47:29,226
Fantastic, isn't it?

532
00:47:29,393 --> 00:47:33,230
Just once to have
such power in my hands.

533
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:43,199
Red on.

534
00:50:15,643 --> 00:50:17,728
Come on, move yourselves!

535
00:50:25,152 --> 00:50:28,197
If there's no more opposition than this
on the road, we should be all right.

536
00:50:28,406 --> 00:50:31,492
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

537
00:50:45,256 --> 00:50:47,216
B Company, to me!

538
00:50:47,383 --> 00:50:50,094
A Company, over there!

539
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:11,490
Excuse the interruption,
Field Marshal, but...

540
00:51:11,657 --> 00:51:14,160
...British paratroopers
have landed...

541
00:51:15,036 --> 00:51:17,913
...three kilometers from here.

542
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,583
Why should they do that?

543
00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:24,086
There is nothing
important here.

544
00:51:27,048 --> 00:51:30,343
Me! I am important.

545
00:51:31,093 --> 00:51:33,429
They must all be coming
just to capture me.

546
00:51:33,596 --> 00:51:35,306
Call my chauffeur and car.

547
00:51:36,265 --> 00:51:38,893
Evacuate the headquarters.

548
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,728
And don't forget my cigars.

549
00:52:19,475 --> 00:52:20,518
General!

550
00:52:21,102 --> 00:52:23,312
- You all right?
- Yeah.

551
00:52:56,637 --> 00:52:59,891
Okay, you guys,
gather your stuff and move!

552
00:53:11,986 --> 00:53:14,405
- This is it, Jim.
- Okay, sir.

553
00:53:18,993 --> 00:53:20,620
You okay?

554
00:53:20,786 --> 00:53:22,705
Right! Let's go!

555
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:27,960
Then keep trying.

556
00:53:28,169 --> 00:53:30,379
There must be someone there!

557
00:53:32,882 --> 00:53:35,968
My apologies.
I can get no sense from anybody.

558
00:53:36,135 --> 00:53:38,638
They say thousands of troops
are dropping over Holland.

559
00:53:38,804 --> 00:53:42,141
- Yes, west of Arnhem.
- Right on top of Field Marshal Model.

560
00:53:42,308 --> 00:53:45,353
I can't get through
to his headquarters.

561
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,564
A strong force has landed
south of Nijmegen.

562
00:53:48,731 --> 00:53:51,984
Nijmegen?
They're after the bridge.

563
00:53:54,612 --> 00:53:58,324
That doesn't matter.

564
00:53:58,533 --> 00:54:00,618
Perhaps they've landed
in the Field Marshal's soup.

565
00:54:01,994 --> 00:54:05,831
Yes, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Now listen.

566
00:54:05,998 --> 00:54:08,042
I'll take care of Arnhem.

567
00:54:08,209 --> 00:54:11,587
You get to Nijmegen
as fast as you can.

568
00:54:11,754 --> 00:54:13,005
Take anything that'll move...

569
00:54:13,214 --> 00:54:16,968
...every man that can walk,
and hold the bridge.

570
00:54:18,886 --> 00:54:21,848
No. Field Marshal Model.

571
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:27,019
Nothing must cross it.
Is that clear?

572
00:54:27,186 --> 00:54:30,147
You must hold that bridge
under any circumstances.

573
00:54:30,314 --> 00:54:33,025
- Understood?
- Clear.

574
00:54:33,317 --> 00:54:35,194
Ryan and Ross,
come with me.

575
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:38,156
Cover the right flank.

576
00:54:44,412 --> 00:54:46,289
How far away is headquarters?

577
00:54:46,455 --> 00:54:48,499
Half a mile.
Maybe more.

578
00:55:14,233 --> 00:55:15,860
Brigadier Lathbury's
just left, sir.

579
00:55:16,068 --> 00:55:18,404
Johnny Frost and the 2nd Battalion
are on the river road.

580
00:55:18,571 --> 00:55:19,906
Good.

581
00:55:20,072 --> 00:55:23,034
Thank you, Baker. Any news of
Freddie Gough's jeep squadron?

582
00:55:23,201 --> 00:55:25,286
- It's unconfirmed...
- It's rather bad luck, sir.

583
00:55:25,453 --> 00:55:28,206
Considering how few gliders
we lost on the way in.

584
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:33,377
It appears that a lot of
the special jeeps failed to arrive...

585
00:55:33,544 --> 00:55:36,005
...and those that did have been
badly shot up in an ambush.

586
00:55:36,172 --> 00:55:39,550
So no one's going to get
to Arnhem Bridge except on foot.

587
00:55:39,717 --> 00:55:40,593
Splendid.

588
00:55:46,974 --> 00:55:51,270
They must be from the lunatic asylum,
located on the far side of the wood.

589
00:55:52,188 --> 00:55:54,148
They escaped when
it was bombed this morning.

590
00:56:00,863 --> 00:56:03,282
Do you think they know
something we don't?

591
00:56:18,131 --> 00:56:20,258
All guns, commence firing!

592
00:56:32,854 --> 00:56:35,189
Right, get moving.
Get moving.

593
00:56:35,356 --> 00:56:36,816
Driver, advance.

594
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,388
Start the purple!

595
00:59:53,554 --> 00:59:55,890
Start the purple!

596
00:59:56,057 --> 00:59:58,142
Take cover!

597
01:00:11,572 --> 01:00:14,033
- Loading!
- Fire!

598
01:01:56,427 --> 01:01:58,846
Get the wounded down the line.

599
01:02:02,642 --> 01:02:05,019
Get that wreck off the road.

600
01:02:11,818 --> 01:02:13,778
Joe, how the hell...

601
01:02:15,321 --> 01:02:19,284
How the hell do they expect us
to keep to schedule on a road like this?

602
01:02:19,492 --> 01:02:21,661
You don't know the worst.

603
01:02:21,828 --> 01:02:24,414
- This bit we're on now...
- Yes?

604
01:02:26,165 --> 01:02:27,500
It's the wide part.

605
01:03:37,403 --> 01:03:40,323
Peter, the general's coming in.

606
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:42,825
- How's it going now?
- Not too well, sir.

607
01:03:43,034 --> 01:03:45,453
We haven't been able to make contact
with General Browning...

608
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:47,539
...30 Corps or England.

609
01:03:48,915 --> 01:03:50,875
So no one knows
we've arrived safely.

610
01:03:51,042 --> 01:03:53,169
Not as far as we know, sir.

611
01:03:54,379 --> 01:03:55,713
What about those VHF sets?

612
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,592
Well, sir, it appears the sets have
been delivered with the wrong crystals.

613
01:04:01,052 --> 01:04:04,180
- So they're quite useless?
- Yes, sir, I'm afraid they are.

614
01:04:07,976 --> 01:04:10,061
Are Brigadier Lathbury and Colonel Frost
aware of what happened...

615
01:04:10,228 --> 01:04:12,689
...to the special jeep squadron?
- Not as far as we know.

616
01:04:12,856 --> 01:04:16,317
At the moment we're unable to contact
any of the units moving into Arnhem.

617
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:21,072
Not a very satisfactory
state of affairs.

618
01:04:22,824 --> 01:04:26,077
We can't quite understand it.
It's perfectly good equipment.

619
01:04:26,244 --> 01:04:28,329
Then for God's sake,
get it sorted out...

620
01:04:28,538 --> 01:04:31,416
...before we have a bloody disaster
on our hands.

621
01:04:42,677 --> 01:04:44,095
Sir.

622
01:04:47,015 --> 01:04:48,892
Hancock...

623
01:04:49,058 --> 01:04:51,644
...I've got lunatics
laughing at me from the woods.

624
01:04:51,811 --> 01:04:55,773
My original plan has been scuppered
now that the jeeps haven't arrived.

625
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:58,610
My communications
have completely broken down.

626
01:05:00,153 --> 01:05:02,655
Do you really believe
that any of that can be helped...

627
01:05:02,822 --> 01:05:04,741
...by a cup of tea?

628
01:05:06,409 --> 01:05:08,328
Couldn't hurt, sir.

629
01:05:24,052 --> 01:05:25,678
Forgive me for returning,
Field Marshal.

630
01:05:25,845 --> 01:05:27,555
I must press for permission...

631
01:05:27,722 --> 01:05:30,099
...if it becomes necessary...

632
01:05:30,266 --> 01:05:35,355
...to blow up the bridges
at Arnhem and Nijmegen.

633
01:05:35,522 --> 01:05:37,190
That is out of the question.

634
01:05:37,357 --> 01:05:39,692
Never.
Is that clear?

635
01:05:39,859 --> 01:05:41,694
We need them
for our counterattack.

636
01:05:41,861 --> 01:05:44,489
Counterattack?
With what?

637
01:05:44,656 --> 01:05:47,534
Paratroopers cannot fight long.
They are too lightly equipped.

638
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,702
Isolated they are lost.

639
01:05:49,911 --> 01:05:52,413
I have spoken
to Von Rundstedt.

640
01:05:52,622 --> 01:05:56,042
All reinforcements
come to us first.

641
01:05:56,209 --> 01:05:59,295
Every hour we get stronger
and they grow weaker.

642
01:05:59,462 --> 01:06:03,925
- But if we blow the bridges...
- They don't want the bridges.

643
01:06:04,092 --> 01:06:06,177
Do you really think
if they wanted the bridges...

644
01:06:06,344 --> 01:06:10,265
...they would have landed
12 kilometers away?

645
01:06:10,432 --> 01:06:12,308
It's ridiculous.

646
01:06:16,521 --> 01:06:18,606
Thank you for the tea.

647
01:07:09,783 --> 01:07:11,868
Our lightning-like assault
on Arnhem Bridge...

648
01:07:12,035 --> 01:07:14,454
...is certainly a smashing success.

649
01:07:15,747 --> 01:07:18,583
I've an aversion to apples.
I'm so sorry.

650
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:21,294
I'm sure the Germans will
be thunderstruck with surprise.

651
01:07:21,503 --> 01:07:24,380
- Are there many of you?
- Yes, there are thousands of us.

652
01:07:25,465 --> 01:07:27,926
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

653
01:07:28,134 --> 01:07:30,470
Look here, this isn't
a victory parade.

654
01:07:30,678 --> 01:07:32,972
Come on, sir,
enjoy the moment.

655
01:07:33,139 --> 01:07:34,974
I will enjoy the moment
when we reach the bridge...

656
01:07:35,141 --> 01:07:36,976
...and when we find the bridge intact.

657
01:07:37,143 --> 01:07:39,479
It will be.
Things couldn't be going better.

658
01:07:39,646 --> 01:07:43,400
- Nothing's wrong.
- I know. That's exactly what is wrong.

659
01:08:36,995 --> 01:08:38,997
Jesus Christ!

660
01:09:00,018 --> 01:09:01,936
Stay down!

661
01:09:19,412 --> 01:09:21,206
Shit.

662
01:09:24,376 --> 01:09:26,378
There's still no contact.

663
01:09:26,544 --> 01:09:28,672
Then keep at it.
I shall be back shortly.

664
01:09:28,838 --> 01:09:31,341
Brigadier Lathbury can't have gone
that far. All right, Brown.

665
01:09:31,508 --> 01:09:34,511
I'm sure we'll have them fixed
by the time you get back, sir.

666
01:09:40,934 --> 01:09:44,312
Can you get a message down
to 30th Corps on that dingus?

667
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:47,607
Yes, sir. We just got word
from the 82nd up ahead.

668
01:09:47,774 --> 01:09:50,068
They've captured the Grave Bridge
completely intact.

669
01:09:50,235 --> 01:09:52,153
That's terrific,
except 30th Corps...

670
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,990
...ain't about to reach
the goddamn intact Grave Bridge...

671
01:09:55,156 --> 01:09:58,118
...until the goddamn Son Bridge
gets fixed.

672
01:09:58,284 --> 01:10:00,412
Tell our British cousins
to hustle up some Bailey stuff.

673
01:10:01,246 --> 01:10:03,123
I'll meet 'em in Eindhoven
when they get there.

674
01:10:03,289 --> 01:10:06,960
Tell those schmucks to do this right and
have their Bailey stuff at the front.

675
01:10:07,127 --> 01:10:08,253
Got that?

676
01:10:09,254 --> 01:10:11,548
And be sure to say please.

677
01:10:21,266 --> 01:10:24,894
Joe, I make it just over six miles
to Eindhoven.

678
01:10:25,103 --> 01:10:28,732
We won't make it tonight.
It'll be dark shortly.

679
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:32,819
Well, I hope to God the 101 st
can hang on till tomorrow.

680
01:10:32,986 --> 01:10:38,408
Giles, remember what the general said:
"We're the cavalry."

681
01:10:38,617 --> 01:10:42,245
It would be bad form
to arrive in advance of schedule.

682
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:46,583
In the nick of time
would do nicely.

683
01:10:49,169 --> 01:10:51,963
These plans should have
been left in England.

684
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:53,340
They're top secret.

685
01:10:53,506 --> 01:10:56,009
And now we have all we need...

686
01:10:56,176 --> 01:11:00,096
Units, defense plans,
objectives...

687
01:11:00,263 --> 01:11:02,724
...and the schedule
for further drops.

688
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:05,268
I have prepared Nijmegen Bridge
for demolition...

689
01:11:05,435 --> 01:11:07,896
...if I blow it up tonight.

690
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:11,191
This Operation Market Garden
must fail.

691
01:11:11,358 --> 01:11:16,446
Why do all my generals
want to destroy my bridges?

692
01:11:16,613 --> 01:11:19,324
Come, Ludwig.
We'll have dinner.

693
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:22,327
Dinner?

694
01:11:22,494 --> 01:11:24,329
But what about these plans?

695
01:11:24,496 --> 01:11:26,998
These plans?
They are false.

696
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:30,502
Just a trick.
We were supposed to find them.

697
01:11:30,669 --> 01:11:32,587
White wine or red?

698
01:11:38,635 --> 01:11:42,264
We're still getting nothing from Colonel
Frost's battalion on the river road.

699
01:11:42,472 --> 01:11:45,517
- Thank you, Cole.
- Dog-Charlie-Fox. Over.

700
01:11:45,684 --> 01:11:47,936
Let's hope Johnny's meeting
less resistance than we are.

701
01:11:48,103 --> 01:11:51,106
- We must break through to the bridge.
- We're completely blocked ahead of us.

702
01:11:51,314 --> 01:11:53,650
There's a good deal more resistance
than we've been led to expect.

703
01:11:53,817 --> 01:11:56,903
I must see for myself how he's doing.
All right, Cole.

704
01:11:57,070 --> 01:11:59,072
- What is their strength?
- I can't estimate yet.

705
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:02,367
Some Dutch Underground people were here
earlier trying to explain the situation.

706
01:12:02,534 --> 01:12:04,327
I'm not sure how much they know.

707
01:12:17,507 --> 01:12:22,137
Stretcher bearer, bring that stretcher
over here to these men!

708
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:24,264
- What about Brown?
- They've both had it.

709
01:12:26,516 --> 01:12:28,894
Christ Almighty!
They've gone round behind us.

710
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:31,605
I think it might be safer
if you spent the night with us.

711
01:12:31,813 --> 01:12:35,317
- I've got to get back to H.Q.
- Yes, but alive, sir.

712
01:12:35,525 --> 01:12:38,612
If we can reach them,
there are some houses in that direction.

713
01:12:38,778 --> 01:12:42,282
We can get ourselves organized
and try and find out what's happening.

714
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:44,326
Pull him out!

715
01:12:44,492 --> 01:12:46,328
- Right.
- Sergeant Major.

716
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:46,263
Come on, lads.
Get a move on.

717
01:13:46,429 --> 01:13:48,348
- Something just occurred to me.
- What's that, sir?

718
01:13:48,515 --> 01:13:50,183
We're wearing the wrong camouflage.

719
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:53,979
It's all very well for the country,
but we won't fool anyone in the towns.

720
01:13:55,647 --> 01:13:57,566
Come on.

721
01:14:03,029 --> 01:14:06,366
I'm awfully sorry, but I'm afraid we're
going to have to occupy your house.

722
01:14:08,535 --> 01:14:11,371
- All right, chaps, we're in here.
- The house on the other side.

723
01:14:11,538 --> 01:14:13,665
- Section Two, over here.
- Dick.

724
01:14:13,874 --> 01:14:16,835
Now, take your men,
occupy that house across the road.

725
01:14:17,002 --> 01:14:19,045
Make sure you can cover the bridge
from your side.

726
01:14:19,212 --> 01:14:20,213
Sergeant, follow me.

727
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:23,425
Hello, Dog-Charlie-Fox.

728
01:14:27,512 --> 01:14:31,224
Rip down those curtains,
pile this furniture against the window.

729
01:14:34,477 --> 01:14:38,023
We've reached our objective.
What is your position? Over.

730
01:14:39,858 --> 01:14:40,859
There's nothing.

731
01:14:41,067 --> 01:14:43,945
I can't contact Brigade
at all, sir.

732
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:46,072
Tried the other battalions?

733
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,742
Any luck?

734
01:14:48,909 --> 01:14:50,952
Keep trying.

735
01:14:53,246 --> 01:14:55,207
- Order them out.
- Please, Mother.

736
01:14:55,373 --> 01:14:57,751
- This is my house.
- Perhaps by tomorrow.

737
01:14:57,918 --> 01:14:59,586
Tomorrow?

738
01:14:59,753 --> 01:15:01,671
Yes, Mother.

739
01:15:20,690 --> 01:15:23,944
Shall we have a go
at the far end now, sir?

740
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:27,364
"Having a go" is hardly
textbook terminology, Harry.

741
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:32,119
But you'll let us try, sir?

742
01:16:30,635 --> 01:16:32,262
Down! Take cover!

743
01:16:32,471 --> 01:16:34,222
Cover fire! Quick!

744
01:16:38,643 --> 01:16:39,603
Smoke!

745
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:48,695
Come on, lads!

746
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:58,080
Come on. Keep going.

747
01:16:59,956 --> 01:17:01,875
Give us a hand.

748
01:17:08,381 --> 01:17:10,300
Fall back!

749
01:17:14,346 --> 01:17:16,390
Hurry.

750
01:17:32,697 --> 01:17:35,325
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

751
01:17:35,492 --> 01:17:37,828
We'll deal with them later...

752
01:17:37,994 --> 01:17:39,871
...when it gets dark.

753
01:18:00,183 --> 01:18:02,978
- Made it so far, Doddsie?
- Aye.

754
01:18:18,535 --> 01:18:20,996
Better hit that slit first time.

755
01:18:22,039 --> 01:18:26,126
Hey, Corp, I said you'd better
hit that slit first time or...

756
01:18:26,293 --> 01:18:27,753
I heard you, boyo.

757
01:18:27,919 --> 01:18:29,838
Oh, great.

758
01:18:30,881 --> 01:18:32,841
After you, Corp.

759
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:53,195
Come on.
Let's get on with it.

760
01:19:01,244 --> 01:19:02,537
Now!

761
01:19:04,456 --> 01:19:06,583
Now we're in trouble.
You bloody missed it!

762
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,919
You knocked my arm,
you clumsy bastard.

763
01:19:09,086 --> 01:19:11,463
Now we'll never get out of here.

764
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:18,679
We've hit an ammunition dump,
a bloody ammo dump. Shit!

765
01:19:49,668 --> 01:19:51,837
Fool's courage.

766
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:26,330
She says you are much too noisy.

767
01:20:26,496 --> 01:20:29,416
She does realize there is something
of a war going on, doesn't she?

768
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:33,045
She has never liked noise.
She hates it.

769
01:20:34,379 --> 01:20:35,380
They're coming.

770
01:20:35,547 --> 01:20:36,923
Excuse me.

771
01:20:40,927 --> 01:20:42,095
Many of them?

772
01:20:42,262 --> 01:20:45,891
Can't tell, sir.
We can only hear them at the moment.

773
01:21:48,495 --> 01:21:50,205
Hold your fire!

774
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:51,790
Hold your fire!

775
01:21:58,130 --> 01:21:59,089
Fire!

776
01:22:04,469 --> 01:22:06,930
Command. Wait for the command.

777
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:18,483
Over there with it.
Look after that man.

778
01:22:18,692 --> 01:22:21,987
Open fire! Fire!

779
01:23:03,987 --> 01:23:05,739
Keep firing. Come on.

780
01:24:23,817 --> 01:24:25,736
Cease firing.

781
01:24:41,585 --> 01:24:43,378
Sorry, ma'am.

782
01:24:44,630 --> 01:24:47,841
Try and rustle up
some more bandages, will you?

783
01:24:49,259 --> 01:24:51,428
Lad, you'll be all right.
See you later.

784
01:24:52,888 --> 01:24:56,058
Get him patched up, Doc.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

785
01:24:57,643 --> 01:24:59,603
- Wicks.
- Sir.

786
01:25:01,605 --> 01:25:03,524
Right, off you go.

787
01:25:15,077 --> 01:25:17,746
Get that bloody stretcher inside!

788
01:25:20,207 --> 01:25:21,917
All right. Here we go.

789
01:25:29,091 --> 01:25:31,468
Good morning. Mr. Cornish
is straight through there.

790
01:25:31,635 --> 01:25:33,554
Right. Thank you.

791
01:25:35,597 --> 01:25:38,267
Hello, Dick.
It's all right. Sit down.

792
01:25:38,433 --> 01:25:41,645
- You all right?
- Fine. It's only a flesh wound.

793
01:25:41,812 --> 01:25:44,273
- How are things?
- Not too bad, sir.

794
01:25:46,608 --> 01:25:48,026
What is bad is this.

795
01:25:48,193 --> 01:25:49,445
- Careful.
- Sorry.

796
01:25:49,611 --> 01:25:53,073
We hold the north end of the bridge.
The Germans hold the south.

797
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:55,617
But now they probably control
most of the town...

798
01:25:55,784 --> 01:25:57,703
...including the church tower.

799
01:25:57,870 --> 01:25:59,705
What you're saying is
that we're surrounded.

800
01:25:59,872 --> 01:26:02,291
Yes, something like that.

801
01:26:02,458 --> 01:26:04,126
- What else?
- Sir.

802
01:26:05,461 --> 01:26:08,422
I was a bit surprised to find
Bittrich's panzer troops here, sir.

803
01:26:16,764 --> 01:26:20,309
Yes, well, surely you didn't believe
all that nonsense they told us.

804
01:26:20,476 --> 01:26:24,605
I mean, about the enemy being
made up of old men, children.

805
01:26:27,357 --> 01:26:28,776
We'll have to risk it.

806
01:26:28,942 --> 01:26:31,111
It's halfway through the morning,
and things aren't getting any better.

807
01:26:31,278 --> 01:26:33,572
- Sergeant, how is it?
- Sir.

808
01:26:33,739 --> 01:26:35,240
We can't clear the streets.

809
01:26:35,407 --> 01:26:38,619
Enemy strength keeps increasing. It's
impossible to get through to the bridge.

810
01:26:38,827 --> 01:26:40,454
Thanks, Sergeant.

811
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:44,291
It's imperative I get back to H.Q.
before the situation gets out of hand.

812
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:47,127
If it's all right with you, Cleminson
and I will come part of the way.

813
01:26:47,336 --> 01:26:49,463
- All right, Jimmy?
- Let's move.

814
01:27:37,219 --> 01:27:39,638
End house,
bottom window, sir.

815
01:27:43,976 --> 01:27:45,227
Cleminson, get over here.

816
01:27:48,355 --> 01:27:50,691
Hang on, Gerald.

817
01:27:53,902 --> 01:27:55,863
In here. Come on.

818
01:27:59,033 --> 01:28:00,868
Can't you move your legs?

819
01:28:03,746 --> 01:28:05,956
Must be the spine.
Can you help us?

820
01:28:06,123 --> 01:28:08,667
- How?
- Don't you know a doctor nearby?

821
01:28:08,834 --> 01:28:10,794
We can take him to the hospital.

822
01:28:16,008 --> 01:28:18,469
You go. He will be fine.

823
01:28:18,677 --> 01:28:20,054
Go, sir.

824
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:21,263
You go.

825
01:28:55,255 --> 01:28:56,715
Go up.

826
01:29:19,822 --> 01:29:23,242
They're certainly at the back.
What's it like at the front?

827
01:29:29,873 --> 01:29:31,125
We're surrounded.

828
01:29:33,002 --> 01:29:34,420
Yes. Quite.

829
01:29:41,218 --> 01:29:43,971
I was rather expecting to see you
again, General Sosabowski.

830
01:29:44,138 --> 01:29:46,056
Do please sit down.

831
01:29:49,893 --> 01:29:53,230
The Polish drop has been cancelled
again. I would like an explanation.

832
01:29:53,397 --> 01:29:56,567
Well, I expect the fog has
a certain amount to do with it.

833
01:29:56,775 --> 01:29:59,361
I'm told there are aircraft flying
50 miles to the south.

834
01:29:59,528 --> 01:30:02,239
Explain to me why my men and equipment
cannot be moved from here to there...

835
01:30:02,406 --> 01:30:03,699
...and then fly to Arnhem.

836
01:30:04,742 --> 01:30:06,785
That's a very reasonable question.

837
01:30:06,952 --> 01:30:10,873
I don't want to bother you with
a lot of meteorological mumbo jumbo...

838
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,459
...but the fact is, you see,
whether we like it or not...

839
01:30:13,626 --> 01:30:16,128
...fog... it moves.

840
01:30:16,295 --> 01:30:18,589
Of course it moves. Where?

841
01:30:18,797 --> 01:30:20,799
That's very difficult
to say, General.

842
01:30:20,966 --> 01:30:23,594
It's very slippery stuff, fog.

843
01:30:23,761 --> 01:30:26,680
You think you've got it,
then it reverses itself...

844
01:30:26,847 --> 01:30:29,266
...and leaves you behind.

845
01:30:29,433 --> 01:30:32,561
Won't you please sit down?

846
01:30:32,770 --> 01:30:34,897
What I'm trying to say, General...

847
01:30:35,105 --> 01:30:37,232
...is even if we move your troops
the 50 miles...

848
01:30:37,441 --> 01:30:39,693
I grant you,
now the sun is shining...

849
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:41,862
...the chances are that
by the time we get there...

850
01:30:42,029 --> 01:30:44,990
...the fog could quite easily
have preceded us.

851
01:30:45,908 --> 01:30:48,494
- So we simply have to wait.
- And do nothing.

852
01:30:48,661 --> 01:30:50,829
I think that puts it rather well.

853
01:31:35,583 --> 01:31:38,294
Hey, you! You Vandeleur?

854
01:31:39,503 --> 01:31:41,255
- Yeah.
- I'm Bobby Stout.

855
01:31:41,422 --> 01:31:42,673
How do you do?

856
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,342
Hell of a day, huh?
Look at 'em... wild.

857
01:31:45,509 --> 01:31:47,011
Have you ever been liberated?

858
01:31:47,177 --> 01:31:50,014
- I got divorced twice. Does that count?
- Yes, that counts.

859
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:52,683
Hey, that Bailey crap.
You got it amongst this stuff?

860
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:55,019
When you refer to Bailey crap...

861
01:31:55,185 --> 01:31:59,106
...I take it you mean that glorious
precision-made British-built bridge...

862
01:31:59,273 --> 01:32:01,233
...which is the envy
of the civilized world.

863
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:04,320
- Yeah.
- The trucks are down there somewhere.

864
01:32:04,528 --> 01:32:06,989
But how you're going to get them
through this crowd, I don't know.

865
01:32:07,156 --> 01:32:10,409
No problem. I got a side road
pegged out that'll avoid all this.

866
01:32:10,576 --> 01:32:12,995
- American ingenuity.
- Oh, really?

867
01:32:13,162 --> 01:32:16,123
Actually I was born in Yugoslavia,
but what the hell.

868
01:32:16,290 --> 01:32:17,666
Yes.

869
01:32:31,639 --> 01:32:33,641
Okay, I'll take it, sir.

870
01:32:38,437 --> 01:32:40,940
- Where the hell have you been?
- With some Dutch friends at Nijmegen.

871
01:32:41,106 --> 01:32:43,817
Look. This is why
we can't take the bridge.

872
01:32:43,984 --> 01:32:45,861
The Germans have moved in
S.S. panzer troops.

873
01:32:46,028 --> 01:32:47,821
You'd think they didn't want us
to get across or something.

874
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:49,782
They've sealed off the whole area.

875
01:32:49,949 --> 01:32:52,993
Here. You can see on this map.

876
01:32:54,036 --> 01:32:56,372
Every street leading to the bridge
is blocked.

877
01:32:56,539 --> 01:32:58,499
Every house around it is occupied.

878
01:32:58,666 --> 01:33:02,044
The Dutch Underground people say
it's just impossible to break through.

879
01:33:03,295 --> 01:33:05,214
They could be right.

880
01:33:09,510 --> 01:33:12,388
- Where's the captain?
- Dead.

881
01:33:14,181 --> 01:33:16,350
I didn't ask you how he was.
I asked you where he was.

882
01:37:49,707 --> 01:37:52,918
Orderly, we're all out
of bandages over here.

883
01:38:25,576 --> 01:38:27,203
- Sir.
- Not now.

884
01:38:27,411 --> 01:38:29,497
- I'd like you to look at my captain.
- I'm sorry. Put him down.

885
01:38:41,926 --> 01:38:45,680
What in the name of hell
do you...

886
01:38:45,846 --> 01:38:49,850
- You told me to put him down.
- I'm in no mood for crapping around.

887
01:38:51,185 --> 01:38:53,437
If you don't look at him right now,
he's going to die.

888
01:38:53,604 --> 01:38:55,523
He's dead now.

889
01:38:57,775 --> 01:38:59,735
It'd mean a lot to me
if you'd check him out.

890
01:38:59,902 --> 01:39:03,072
Come on, Sergeant.
For Christ's sake, get him out of here.

891
01:39:10,413 --> 01:39:12,873
Would you look at him,
please, sir...

892
01:39:14,625 --> 01:39:17,211
...right now...

893
01:39:17,378 --> 01:39:20,423
...or I'll blow
your fuckin' head off.

894
01:39:26,303 --> 01:39:27,763
Right now.

895
01:39:34,562 --> 01:39:36,605
I can give him a quick examination,
if you like.

896
01:39:36,772 --> 01:39:38,899
Thank you very much, sir.

897
01:39:51,287 --> 01:39:53,914
Son of a bitch.

898
01:39:54,081 --> 01:39:55,625
Orderly!

899
01:40:54,433 --> 01:40:57,436
Well, I got the bullet
out of his skull.

900
01:40:57,645 --> 01:41:00,773
- He's gonna live though, right?
- He's gonna have one hell of a headache.

901
01:41:08,155 --> 01:41:10,783
Guess you can turn me in now, sir.

902
01:41:10,950 --> 01:41:13,619
That was a court-martial offense.
You understand that?

903
01:41:13,786 --> 01:41:16,747
- Yes, sir.
- Hope to hell it was worth it.

904
01:41:18,499 --> 01:41:21,085
Guess only time
will tell on that, sir.

905
01:41:21,252 --> 01:41:23,963
My response is strictly limited,
regardless of my personal preference.

906
01:41:24,130 --> 01:41:25,923
- You understand that too?
- I do.

907
01:41:26,090 --> 01:41:27,258
Like somebody cheating in school.

908
01:41:27,425 --> 01:41:30,595
Once word gets out that you can behave
any way you goddamn please...

909
01:41:30,761 --> 01:41:33,139
...discipline's gone,
forget about getting it back.

910
01:41:33,306 --> 01:41:36,392
So you're gonna have to be arrested,
over and out. Lieutenant Rafferty.

911
01:41:36,559 --> 01:41:38,269
Yes, sir, Colonel.

912
01:41:38,436 --> 01:41:41,522
Lieutenant Rafferty,
this is Sergeant... What's your name?

913
01:41:41,689 --> 01:41:43,357
Eddie Dohun.

914
01:41:43,524 --> 01:41:45,693
Sergeant Dohun pulled a gun on me
and threatened to kill me...

915
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:48,195
...unless I did precisely
what he ordered.

916
01:41:48,362 --> 01:41:50,197
- I want you to put him under arrest.
- Yes, sir.

917
01:41:50,364 --> 01:41:54,118
I want you to keep him there
for at least ten seconds.

918
01:41:55,494 --> 01:41:59,290
- I'm not all that sure I understand.
- Count to ten, Lieutenant, fast.

919
01:42:00,875 --> 01:42:03,252
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten. Like that?

920
01:42:03,419 --> 01:42:05,922
Thank you, Lieutenant.

921
01:42:09,675 --> 01:42:11,886
This is yours, I think.

922
01:42:13,012 --> 01:42:14,972
It sure looks like mine.

923
01:42:18,809 --> 01:42:21,687
You scared the shit out of me,
you stupid bastard.

924
01:42:21,854 --> 01:42:24,190
You did a fine job yourself,
if it makes you feel any better.

925
01:42:24,357 --> 01:42:26,359
Goddamn right it does.

926
01:42:26,525 --> 01:42:29,028
- Eddie?
- Sir.

927
01:42:29,195 --> 01:42:32,240
You wouldn't really
have killed me, would you?

928
01:42:37,870 --> 01:42:39,789
Thank you, sir.

929
01:42:56,222 --> 01:42:59,517
Right!
Let's haul a little ass! Go!

930
01:43:12,738 --> 01:43:15,700
Hold! Hold!

931
01:43:28,713 --> 01:43:31,966
Move it. Come on, soldier,
you're not building a sand castle.

932
01:43:50,526 --> 01:43:53,154
Come on, boys.
Use your muscle.

933
01:43:53,321 --> 01:43:55,239
Heave.

934
01:43:55,406 --> 01:43:57,283
Come on, heave!

935
01:43:58,493 --> 01:44:01,245
Unload quickly.

936
01:44:01,412 --> 01:44:04,582
- It's all right, sir.
- Come on, move yourself.

937
01:44:06,751 --> 01:44:08,711
We haven't got all day.

938
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:16,427
Come on, push!

939
01:44:35,488 --> 01:44:37,824
Altogether, lift!

940
01:44:40,535 --> 01:44:44,872
Come on, soldier, pound it.
We've got a schedule to meet.

941
01:45:04,433 --> 01:45:06,602
Steady.

942
01:45:14,861 --> 01:45:16,279
Hold it.

943
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:22,410
- How much longer now?
- About another four hours, sir.

944
01:45:23,578 --> 01:45:24,662
Shit.

945
01:45:25,455 --> 01:45:29,083
Come on, boys.
We're not doing this for fun.

946
01:45:59,655 --> 01:46:02,033
- Hey, soldier, get over here.
- Yes, sir.

947
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:04,368
- Pull on this rope.
- Yes, sir.

948
01:46:04,535 --> 01:46:07,789
Didn't you ever build
a Bailey bridge before?

949
01:46:08,956 --> 01:46:11,375
Neither did I.

950
01:46:22,512 --> 01:46:25,223
Clear the way! Clear!

951
01:46:29,685 --> 01:46:31,604
We haven't got all day.

952
01:46:31,771 --> 01:46:34,065
Roll it, fellas!

953
01:46:34,232 --> 01:46:37,026
Right. Come on. All aboard.
Let's get moving again.

954
01:47:03,511 --> 01:47:05,763
- Thanks, fellas.
- Be seeing you.

955
01:47:12,061 --> 01:47:16,023
- What's wrong, sir?
- They're 36 hours behind schedule.

956
01:47:34,959 --> 01:47:36,502
Lieutenant.

957
01:47:36,669 --> 01:47:38,379
Sir.

958
01:47:38,546 --> 01:47:42,008
We'll be turning you over
to the 82nd now.

959
01:47:42,175 --> 01:47:44,510
They're good soldiers, the 82nd.

960
01:47:44,677 --> 01:47:47,221
Just be sure you keep your hand
on your wallet at all times.

961
01:47:47,388 --> 01:47:48,639
Yes, sir.

962
01:48:38,731 --> 01:48:40,692
They're here.

963
01:48:44,737 --> 01:48:47,490
It's 30 Corps.
They're here, chaps.

964
01:48:53,746 --> 01:48:57,583
You're late, you lazy bastard,
but we'll forgive you!

965
01:48:58,793 --> 01:49:00,378
That was gracious of me.

966
01:49:02,755 --> 01:49:06,092
Take cover!
Bring up the Piat.

967
01:49:07,176 --> 01:49:09,887
Make sure it's within range.

968
01:49:53,306 --> 01:49:56,142
Come on! You'll miss him.

969
01:50:25,254 --> 01:50:27,757
Right, lads! Go, go!

970
01:50:39,811 --> 01:50:41,312
Corporal!

971
01:50:41,479 --> 01:50:43,356
I need a jeep.
Well done, laddie.

972
01:50:43,523 --> 01:50:47,068
- We thought you were dead.
- I can assure you it was an error.

973
01:51:05,253 --> 01:51:06,963
That was the bleeding general.

974
01:51:08,172 --> 01:51:11,217
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, sir.

975
01:51:11,384 --> 01:51:13,845
Carry on, thank you.
Good morning, Baker.

976
01:51:14,012 --> 01:51:15,888
Good morning, James.

977
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:22,562
Harry. Apologies for
my enforced absence. Dennis.

978
01:51:22,729 --> 01:51:24,689
- Sir.
- Lathbury's been put out of action.

979
01:51:24,856 --> 01:51:27,233
I'd like you to go into town,
take over the brigade.

980
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:29,444
- How soon can you leave?
- Right away.

981
01:51:29,652 --> 01:51:31,988
Pull them together and keep
pushing forward to the bridge.

982
01:51:32,196 --> 01:51:33,948
Did the rest of the division
arrive safely?

983
01:51:34,115 --> 01:51:36,117
Yes, but we've run into
all kinds of trouble.

984
01:51:36,284 --> 01:51:39,495
It would seem that we've landed
on top of two S.S. panzer divisions.

985
01:51:39,662 --> 01:51:40,622
Good God.

986
01:51:40,830 --> 01:51:42,790
As you can imagine,
it's hard to stop tanks...

987
01:51:42,957 --> 01:51:45,627
...with rifles and machine guns.
- Show me.

988
01:51:46,502 --> 01:51:48,421
You can see what we're up against.

989
01:51:48,588 --> 01:51:51,257
Johnny Frost and some of his chaps have
managed to get as far as the bridge.

990
01:51:51,424 --> 01:51:53,885
But the Germans are driving
down here towards the river...

991
01:51:54,052 --> 01:51:57,430
...and may even now
have cut them off completely.

992
01:51:57,597 --> 01:52:01,809
Now the entire division is here, we
should be able to break through to him.

993
01:52:01,976 --> 01:52:04,520
It certainly gives us
more of a chance.

994
01:52:04,687 --> 01:52:07,023
Sosabowski's Polish brigade
is due in at 12:00.

995
01:52:07,190 --> 01:52:08,274
If it arrives.

996
01:52:08,441 --> 01:52:11,194
Yesterday's airlift was three hours late
due to fog in England.

997
01:52:11,361 --> 01:52:14,030
The gliders bringing the Poles'
equipment didn't arrive at all.

998
01:52:14,197 --> 01:52:17,659
- Now give me the good news.
- I'm afraid there isn't any, sir.

999
01:52:17,867 --> 01:52:19,702
As you can see,
we're more or less surrounded.

1000
01:52:19,869 --> 01:52:24,499
So far we're holding our own, but we're
desperately short of food, medicine...

1001
01:52:24,666 --> 01:52:26,793
...and above all, ammunition.

1002
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:29,045
- Are we getting our daily supply drop?
- Oh, yes.

1003
01:52:29,212 --> 01:52:32,090
The Royal Air Force
are flying in on schedule.

1004
01:52:32,257 --> 01:52:35,885
The trouble is, the Germans
have overrun the dropping zones.

1005
01:52:36,052 --> 01:52:39,097
- Don't our pilots know that?
- I'm afraid not, sir.

1006
01:52:39,264 --> 01:52:40,682
In heaven's name, why?

1007
01:52:40,848 --> 01:52:43,518
It's the radios, sir.

1008
01:52:45,311 --> 01:52:49,899
We still haven't been able to make
contact with anyone outside Arnhem.

1009
01:53:05,665 --> 01:53:07,542
Fools!

1010
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:09,878
Boody fools, this way!

1011
01:53:11,504 --> 01:53:13,423
We're over here!

1012
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:25,435
We're here!

1013
01:53:32,984 --> 01:53:35,236
- This way.
- Drop 'em over here.

1014
01:53:35,403 --> 01:53:38,239
What the hell are they doing?
They must be able to see us.

1015
01:53:38,406 --> 01:53:40,241
They can see us all right, laddie...

1016
01:53:40,408 --> 01:53:43,244
...but they're under orders
to ignore signals from the ground.

1017
01:53:43,411 --> 01:53:45,246
For all they know,
we could be Germans.

1018
01:53:45,413 --> 01:53:47,832
They're giving it all
to the bloody Germans.

1019
01:53:59,928 --> 01:54:01,387
Charles.

1020
01:54:04,933 --> 01:54:06,726
Poor bastard.

1021
01:54:06,893 --> 01:54:09,646
Oh, well, maybe tomorrow.

1022
01:54:23,117 --> 01:54:24,577
Here.

1023
01:54:31,543 --> 01:54:34,796
He'll never make it.
Those bleeding snipers will get him.

1024
01:54:36,214 --> 01:54:38,133
Come back!

1025
01:54:47,392 --> 01:54:49,102
Come on, Ginger mate.

1026
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:59,487
- He'll never lift it.
- Come on, mate!

1027
01:55:02,740 --> 01:55:04,659
Bring it back, mate.
Come on.

1028
01:55:08,955 --> 01:55:11,207
Come on!

1029
01:55:15,253 --> 01:55:16,754
Run, laddie, run!

1030
01:55:24,429 --> 01:55:27,265
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1031
01:56:00,173 --> 01:56:02,884
Taxi!

1032
01:56:17,190 --> 01:56:20,318
- Do you get all that?
- She wants somebody to call her a taxi.

1033
01:56:40,839 --> 01:56:42,006
Taxi.

1034
01:57:11,578 --> 01:57:13,830
- Doctor.
- Good evening, Kate.

1035
01:57:13,997 --> 01:57:18,376
May I introduce Mrs. Ter Horst,
Colonel Weaver.

1036
01:57:18,543 --> 01:57:21,963
Is your husband
not returned yet?

1037
01:57:22,172 --> 01:57:23,798
He should have been here by now.

1038
01:57:23,965 --> 01:57:27,510
He must be having difficulties
coming through the German lines.

1039
01:57:28,636 --> 01:57:30,764
Well, in that case...

1040
01:57:30,930 --> 01:57:33,516
...we will have to ask you
for a decision.

1041
01:57:33,683 --> 01:57:36,561
Colonel Weaver
has a request to make.

1042
01:57:36,728 --> 01:57:39,105
What we've done is
we've set up...

1043
01:57:39,272 --> 01:57:43,151
...a defensive pocket,
more or less thumb-shaped...

1044
01:57:43,318 --> 01:57:45,236
...with the river as the base.

1045
01:57:45,403 --> 01:57:48,907
Mrs. Ter Horst speaks
surprisingly good English, Colonel.

1046
01:57:50,116 --> 01:57:52,410
Then you understand that we're
in quite a strong position...

1047
01:57:52,577 --> 01:57:55,497
...for holding out
until 30 Corps reaches us.

1048
01:57:55,663 --> 01:57:58,541
But we have to make
certain arrangements.

1049
01:58:00,001 --> 01:58:04,297
The words come through. I don't know
if I follow the military strategy.

1050
01:58:04,464 --> 01:58:07,634
We have the main hospital, of course,
but it is full to bursting.

1051
01:58:09,594 --> 01:58:12,972
Perhaps you understand
that we have great need...

1052
01:58:13,139 --> 01:58:15,058
...of additional space.

1053
01:58:21,981 --> 01:58:25,402
Our house would seem suitable.

1054
01:58:25,568 --> 01:58:27,862
It's just for the slightly wounded.

1055
01:58:28,029 --> 01:58:30,323
You know, we'll patch them up,
send them back... that sort of thing.

1056
01:58:30,490 --> 01:58:34,411
I feel it will need
a little more than that.

1057
01:58:39,791 --> 01:58:41,334
We're wasting time. Come.

1058
01:58:41,501 --> 01:58:44,045
- Doctor.
- Thank you, Kate.

1059
01:58:44,254 --> 01:58:48,049
I will see you.
I will come back.

1060
01:58:51,011 --> 01:58:53,722
You come in. Let's see.

1061
01:58:55,932 --> 01:58:58,184
Please sit.
Come take this chair.

1062
01:59:00,937 --> 01:59:04,316
- Come over here with me, lads.
- Thanks very much.

1063
01:59:04,482 --> 01:59:06,401
Sit down.

1064
01:59:07,485 --> 01:59:09,446
Let me help you.

1065
01:59:20,957 --> 01:59:23,543
Oh, colonel,
the major wants you upstairs, sir.

1066
01:59:23,710 --> 01:59:25,587
Okay. Thank you.

1067
01:59:28,757 --> 01:59:30,175
All right?

1068
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:39,142
Thank you.

1069
01:59:39,309 --> 01:59:41,811
Still in one piece, Dodds?

1070
01:59:41,978 --> 01:59:45,315
Good. All right, Potter?

1071
01:59:46,733 --> 01:59:48,610
That's far enough!

1072
01:59:48,777 --> 01:59:52,280
We can hear you from there.

1073
01:59:54,282 --> 01:59:57,202
Rather an interesting
development, sir.

1074
01:59:57,369 --> 02:00:02,666
My general says there is no point
in continuing this fighting.

1075
02:00:02,832 --> 02:00:06,044
He is willing to discuss
a surrender.

1076
02:00:10,173 --> 02:00:12,008
Tell him to go to hell.

1077
02:00:13,885 --> 02:00:17,806
We haven't the proper facilities
to take you all prisoner!

1078
02:00:17,973 --> 02:00:18,932
Sorry.

1079
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:20,600
What?

1080
02:00:20,809 --> 02:00:25,814
We'd like to, but we can't
accept your surrender.

1081
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:30,402
Was there anything else?

1082
02:00:39,077 --> 02:00:40,537
All right.

1083
02:01:04,269 --> 02:01:06,563
And now?

1084
02:01:06,730 --> 02:01:09,149
Flatten Arnhem.

1085
02:02:52,419 --> 02:02:55,213
- Any movement at Nijmegen?
- None.

1086
02:02:55,380 --> 02:02:56,840
No way of bLasting through
to the bridge?

1087
02:02:57,048 --> 02:03:00,510
I'd lose all my men for nothing. There's
God knows how many out there already.

1088
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:01,887
You mean it's over?

1089
02:03:02,053 --> 02:03:04,472
I didn't say that, did I?

1090
02:03:04,639 --> 02:03:06,474
We've paid for that bridge,
and we're going to collect.

1091
02:03:06,641 --> 02:03:09,060
But to do it,
I need tank support.

1092
02:03:10,103 --> 02:03:11,730
You've got it, Jimmy.

1093
02:03:11,897 --> 02:03:15,233
The Grenadier Guards will be happy
to oblige. Is that all right, Alex?

1094
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:16,902
Absolutely.

1095
02:03:17,068 --> 02:03:19,446
It's not just tanks.
I need boats.

1096
02:03:19,613 --> 02:03:22,532
If 30 Corps were American, we would
have boats. Did you bring any?

1097
02:03:22,699 --> 02:03:25,577
- Mike?
- We might have a few about somewhere.

1098
02:03:25,744 --> 02:03:28,914
- Can you get them here by tonight?
- It won't be easy.

1099
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:31,750
We've got one road,
ten-mile traffic jams on it...

1100
02:03:31,917 --> 02:03:33,835
...and Germans throwing shells at us.

1101
02:03:34,002 --> 02:03:37,464
- I don't know quite what we can do...
- Except try. You can do that, can't you?

1102
02:03:38,965 --> 02:03:41,760
Thank you, gentlemen.
Now, look here.

1103
02:03:41,927 --> 02:03:43,929
About these boats...

1104
02:03:44,095 --> 02:03:46,932
What is your opinion?
How many?

1105
02:03:47,098 --> 02:03:50,894
The general's a bit scratchy today,
but it's nothing personal.

1106
02:03:51,061 --> 02:03:53,396
When we dropped on Sunday...

1107
02:03:53,563 --> 02:03:55,899
...I think he cracked his spine.

1108
02:04:05,075 --> 02:04:08,328
- How many boats have we got then?
- About six in each truck.

1109
02:04:22,217 --> 02:04:24,553
Where's Major Cook, soldier?

1110
02:04:25,846 --> 02:04:28,140
- I think over there, sir.
- Thank you.

1111
02:04:43,572 --> 02:04:45,198
Julian, where the hell are you?

1112
02:04:46,908 --> 02:04:48,285
Here, sir.

1113
02:04:53,331 --> 02:04:55,500
We're going to take
Nijmegen Bridge tonight.

1114
02:04:55,667 --> 02:04:59,588
- What's the best way to take a bridge?
- Both ends at once.

1115
02:05:00,464 --> 02:05:03,467
I'm sending two companies
across the river by boat.

1116
02:05:03,633 --> 02:05:06,303
I need a man with
very special qualities to lead.

1117
02:05:08,013 --> 02:05:09,181
Go on, sir.

1118
02:05:09,347 --> 02:05:13,560
He's got to be tough enough
and experienced enough to do it.

1119
02:05:13,727 --> 02:05:15,145
Plus one more thing.

1120
02:05:15,312 --> 02:05:17,522
He's gotta be dumb enough to do it.

1121
02:05:19,149 --> 02:05:20,734
Start getting ready.

1122
02:05:28,033 --> 02:05:29,576
What was all that about?

1123
02:05:30,577 --> 02:05:33,455
Well, someone's come up
with a real nightmare.

1124
02:05:39,085 --> 02:05:42,464
Come on! Keep moving!

1125
02:05:49,429 --> 02:05:51,640
We just got word from
the Dutch Resistance people at Arnhem.

1126
02:05:51,848 --> 02:05:54,476
- And?
- It's not going well for the British.

1127
02:05:54,684 --> 02:05:56,603
Their main force
never reached the bridge.

1128
02:05:56,770 --> 02:05:58,814
Those that did are hanging on
by their fingernails.

1129
02:05:59,022 --> 02:06:01,316
- And General Urquhart?
- He's got his back to the river.

1130
02:06:01,525 --> 02:06:05,195
The Germans trapped his men in a pocket
and they're squeezing it smaller.

1131
02:06:05,362 --> 02:06:08,073
How long can he hold?

1132
02:06:09,491 --> 02:06:11,701
Where are those goddamn boats?

1133
02:06:28,176 --> 02:06:29,511
Just keep it clear.

1134
02:06:29,678 --> 02:06:31,638
Right.

1135
02:06:31,805 --> 02:06:34,224
They're no further
than we thought. Julian.

1136
02:06:34,391 --> 02:06:37,519
- Sir.
- There's been a change in plans.

1137
02:06:37,686 --> 02:06:39,604
We're gonna make the crossing
in daylight.

1138
02:06:41,273 --> 02:06:43,692
- Daylight.
- Traffic's all screwed up for miles.

1139
02:06:43,859 --> 02:06:45,610
By the time we're ready,
it'll be 0800.

1140
02:06:45,777 --> 02:06:48,572
- That's when we go.
- Fine.

1141
02:06:49,573 --> 02:06:52,159
I'd like to wait and go tomorrow night,
but the British can't hold.

1142
02:06:54,369 --> 02:06:56,747
Better by daylight.

1143
02:06:56,913 --> 02:06:59,291
Much.

1144
02:07:05,047 --> 02:07:07,591
- Any news of the boats?
- No. We're switching...

1145
02:07:07,758 --> 02:07:10,343
- You want some?
- No, thank you.

1146
02:07:10,552 --> 02:07:13,180
We're switching the start to 9:00
just to make sure.

1147
02:07:13,388 --> 02:07:15,640
You start laying smoke
just before we go.

1148
02:07:15,807 --> 02:07:17,893
Fine.

1149
02:07:18,060 --> 02:07:20,312
They're going to get creamed
from the far embankment.

1150
02:07:20,479 --> 02:07:23,857
Your smoke screen's gonna be
their only protection.

1151
02:07:24,024 --> 02:07:26,443
Don't worry.
We'll cover you.

1152
02:07:27,694 --> 02:07:28,862
Please.

1153
02:07:39,081 --> 02:07:43,210
Okay, can I have
your attention, please?

1154
02:07:43,418 --> 02:07:47,214
I'm pleased to inform you that our 9:00
departure has been postponed till 10:00.

1155
02:07:47,381 --> 02:07:50,050
So you can all have
an extra hour's fun and relaxation.

1156
02:07:51,093 --> 02:07:52,135
- Major?
- Yes.

1157
02:07:52,302 --> 02:07:54,262
We got any more information
on those boats?

1158
02:07:54,429 --> 02:07:59,351
We're reliably informed that they float.
Outside of that, we don't know squat.

1159
02:07:59,518 --> 02:08:02,604
Not how many, not how heavy,
not how big.

1160
02:08:02,771 --> 02:08:07,192
We are sure that the river is wide
and that the current is strong.

1161
02:08:07,359 --> 02:08:11,071
As any more cheery information comes
my way, I'll be happy to pass it along.

1162
02:08:11,238 --> 02:08:14,241
In the meantime, just think of this
as on-the-job training.

1163
02:08:17,577 --> 02:08:20,414
What's the matter?
No sense of humor?

1164
02:08:21,832 --> 02:08:23,250
Goddamn it!

1165
02:08:25,127 --> 02:08:26,712
We go at noon.

1166
02:08:39,349 --> 02:08:42,185
Come on. Clear those roads!

1167
02:09:13,467 --> 02:09:18,388
You men are probably wondering
why I've called us here together.

1168
02:09:19,598 --> 02:09:22,559
I've reached a decision
that I'd like to share with you all.

1169
02:09:24,936 --> 02:09:27,439
I intend to go across
like George Washington...

1170
02:09:27,648 --> 02:09:29,775
...standing on the prow.

1171
02:09:29,941 --> 02:09:31,401
You guys can do the rowing.

1172
02:09:38,992 --> 02:09:42,329
- That's it! Move 'em out!
- Here we go!

1173
02:09:43,413 --> 02:09:45,332
Get up there, guys.

1174
02:09:52,506 --> 02:09:53,966
It's heavy.

1175
02:09:58,804 --> 02:09:59,846
What the...

1176
02:10:00,013 --> 02:10:03,475
What'd you expect, destroyers?
Come on, put it together. Unload 'em.

1177
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:09,898
Easy on them, guys.

1178
02:10:21,493 --> 02:10:24,288
- How many more?
- Get those sides up.

1179
02:10:24,454 --> 02:10:26,164
Fire!

1180
02:10:33,630 --> 02:10:35,215
What else can you see
besides smoke?

1181
02:10:35,382 --> 02:10:38,844
Nothing yet, but they are
going to try a river assault.

1182
02:10:39,886 --> 02:10:41,263
It will fail.

1183
02:10:41,430 --> 02:10:43,932
Of course it will fail, but...

1184
02:10:44,141 --> 02:10:47,019
...what do we do
if it doesn't?

1185
02:10:47,185 --> 02:10:49,688
I ask your permission
to blow up the bridge.

1186
02:10:49,855 --> 02:10:51,315
Out of the question.

1187
02:10:53,567 --> 02:10:56,445
I understand, Field Marshal.

1188
02:10:56,612 --> 02:11:00,824
They will not cross the river
and we will blow no bridges.

1189
02:11:00,991 --> 02:11:02,618
Have all demolition charges
been checked?

1190
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:05,495
Yes, sir.
Everything is wired and ready.

1191
02:11:05,662 --> 02:11:08,415
Captain Krafft
is standing by as ordered.

1192
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:13,170
The bridge will not
fall into enemy hands.

1193
02:11:14,254 --> 02:11:16,798
As soon as the first
British tank starts to cross...

1194
02:11:18,258 --> 02:11:19,801
...I'll blow it sky-high.

1195
02:11:32,648 --> 02:11:35,817
- Let's get going!
- All right! Go, go, go!

1196
02:11:55,254 --> 02:11:57,130
Go on. Don't wait. Go.

1197
02:12:11,103 --> 02:12:13,063
Jump in, boys.

1198
02:12:19,319 --> 02:12:22,698
If you don't have an oar,
use your rifle butts, anything.

1199
02:12:22,906 --> 02:12:24,408
Row!

1200
02:12:47,222 --> 02:12:49,683
One, two.

1201
02:12:58,734 --> 02:13:01,612
The current's taking us down.
Stay to your right.

1202
02:13:08,493 --> 02:13:11,538
- Support fire ordered, sir.
- Right. Thank you.

1203
02:13:33,769 --> 02:13:35,062
Get down!

1204
02:13:47,574 --> 02:13:49,868
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1205
02:14:30,951 --> 02:14:34,329
We're drifting!
Pull to your left!

1206
02:14:34,496 --> 02:14:36,832
Pull!

1207
02:14:38,292 --> 02:14:40,752
Keep it going, boys.
Keep rowing.

1208
02:14:49,470 --> 02:14:50,554
Stay down.

1209
02:14:53,140 --> 02:14:55,601
Come on, boys.

1210
02:15:04,359 --> 02:15:06,320
Thy will be done.

1211
02:15:18,499 --> 02:15:20,959
Come on. Let's go.

1212
02:15:21,168 --> 02:15:23,045
Let's go!

1213
02:15:38,685 --> 02:15:39,937
Snipers!

1214
02:15:53,033 --> 02:15:54,451
Help me.

1215
02:16:14,304 --> 02:16:15,806
Go up the side.

1216
02:16:25,441 --> 02:16:27,568
Second platoon!

1217
02:16:27,735 --> 02:16:30,237
- Can we make it through the tunnel?
- No way, sir.

1218
02:16:33,198 --> 02:16:34,700
Up the bank.

1219
02:16:49,381 --> 02:16:50,841
Cover.

1220
02:16:58,932 --> 02:17:00,893
Come on.

1221
02:17:45,104 --> 02:17:46,146
Sergeant.

1222
02:17:46,313 --> 02:17:49,108
Take four across, draw fire.
Harry and I'll go up the side.

1223
02:17:49,274 --> 02:17:50,526
You cover.

1224
02:17:50,693 --> 02:17:52,027
Go, go, go!

1225
02:17:58,325 --> 02:17:59,451
Come on.

1226
02:17:59,618 --> 02:18:01,245
Let's go!

1227
02:18:21,849 --> 02:18:23,142
Are you ready?

1228
02:18:23,308 --> 02:18:24,435
Yes, General.

1229
02:18:41,452 --> 02:18:43,329
Goddamn it.

1230
02:19:32,878 --> 02:19:36,131
My God, they're only
18 kilometers from Arnhem.

1231
02:19:37,216 --> 02:19:39,718
Who can stop them now?

1232
02:19:41,178 --> 02:19:43,347
No one.

1233
02:20:14,837 --> 02:20:16,714
Oh, hell.

1234
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:18,716
Any chance, Whitney?

1235
02:20:18,882 --> 02:20:20,884
No, sir, not unless we're relieved
in the next few hours.

1236
02:20:21,051 --> 02:20:22,886
Harry?

1237
02:20:23,053 --> 02:20:26,140
- Try and get him down to the cellar.
- Very good, sir.

1238
02:20:51,498 --> 02:20:53,167
It's working.

1239
02:20:53,334 --> 02:20:55,169
I'm through to H.Q.
Where's the colonel?

1240
02:20:55,336 --> 02:20:56,587
- Down below.
- Get him.

1241
02:20:56,754 --> 02:20:59,173
- Colonel Frost!
- What is it?

1242
02:20:59,340 --> 02:21:01,216
Up top.

1243
02:21:04,136 --> 02:21:06,430
It's Headquarters, sir,
on the radio.

1244
02:21:06,597 --> 02:21:07,640
Coming.

1245
02:21:11,310 --> 02:21:14,647
Sunray on set.
Pass your message. Over.

1246
02:21:14,813 --> 02:21:17,191
What's your situation, Johnny?
Over.

1247
02:21:17,358 --> 02:21:19,985
I hadn't expected
the pleasure, sir.

1248
02:21:20,194 --> 02:21:22,238
We are holding out.

1249
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:27,743
We need reinforcements
and above all, ammunition. Over.

1250
02:21:27,910 --> 02:21:30,663
I'm not sure if it's a case
of us coming for you...

1251
02:21:30,871 --> 02:21:33,082
...or you coming for us.

1252
02:21:33,249 --> 02:21:36,001
Well, we'll just wait
for 30 Corps then.

1253
02:21:36,210 --> 02:21:37,878
That would probably be best.

1254
02:21:38,045 --> 02:21:40,673
Very reassuring
talking to you, sir.

1255
02:21:42,758 --> 02:21:45,177
I'm sorry, Johnny, getting stuck
on that bloody bridge...

1256
02:21:45,344 --> 02:21:47,638
...four days on your own.

1257
02:21:47,805 --> 02:21:49,056
Have you anything else for me?

1258
02:21:49,223 --> 02:21:53,060
No, sir. I'll give you a call
when our friends arrive. Over.

1259
02:21:53,227 --> 02:21:55,646
All right.

1260
02:21:55,813 --> 02:21:58,649
Good luck. Out.

1261
02:22:05,364 --> 02:22:07,700
- Sergeant Tomblin!
- Here, sir.

1262
02:22:07,908 --> 02:22:09,535
I'm coming over.

1263
02:22:12,538 --> 02:22:14,123
Sergeant Taylor!

1264
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:27,177
I don't understand.
Why aren't you moving?

1265
02:22:27,344 --> 02:22:28,804
What's the matter with you guys?

1266
02:22:28,971 --> 02:22:31,891
Those are British troops
at Arnhem.

1267
02:22:32,057 --> 02:22:34,059
They're hurt bad.

1268
02:22:34,226 --> 02:22:37,229
You're not gonna stop,
not now.

1269
02:22:37,396 --> 02:22:39,690
I'm sorry.
We have our orders.

1270
02:22:39,857 --> 02:22:42,359
We busted our asses getting here.
Half my men are killed.

1271
02:22:42,526 --> 02:22:45,196
You're just gonna stop...

1272
02:22:45,362 --> 02:22:47,990
...and drink tea?

1273
02:22:48,157 --> 02:22:50,451
We're now facing a completely
different situation.

1274
02:22:50,618 --> 02:22:54,413
We can't lead with tanks up that road.
Jerry'll pick us off like sitting ducks.

1275
02:22:54,580 --> 02:22:58,250
Our infantry is fighting in Nijmegen.
When they get here, we'll move on.

1276
02:23:03,631 --> 02:23:06,217
For Christ's sake, must you
do everything by the book?

1277
02:23:06,383 --> 02:23:09,637
Our orders are to wait
for the infantry.

1278
02:23:09,803 --> 02:23:11,222
I'm sorry, but there it is.

1279
02:23:23,359 --> 02:23:25,736
It's Major Carlyle, sir.

1280
02:23:39,708 --> 02:23:41,710
All right. I'm all right.

1281
02:23:54,765 --> 02:23:57,518
Things are not so good, eh?

1282
02:24:03,399 --> 02:24:06,318
I've been meaning
to ask you something...

1283
02:24:06,485 --> 02:24:10,030
...and I haven't because I know
you were so anxious that I should...

1284
02:24:11,866 --> 02:24:14,702
...and I wouldn't give you
the satisfaction.

1285
02:24:18,289 --> 02:24:22,209
Why the hell do you always carry
that bloody umbrella?

1286
02:24:23,919 --> 02:24:26,714
- Memory.
- What?

1287
02:24:26,881 --> 02:24:29,633
Bad memory.

1288
02:24:31,552 --> 02:24:34,722
Always forgot the password.

1289
02:24:37,975 --> 02:24:40,060
I knew no Jerry...

1290
02:24:40,227 --> 02:24:42,605
...would ever carry one.

1291
02:24:44,607 --> 02:24:47,777
I had...

1292
02:24:47,943 --> 02:24:51,822
...to prove I was an Englishman.

1293
02:25:18,682 --> 02:25:21,811
Get back!
Back into the houses.

1294
02:25:34,573 --> 02:25:37,326
30 Corps, please hurry.

1295
02:25:44,792 --> 02:25:47,378
- Nothing, sir.
- All right. Thank you, Corporal.

1296
02:25:47,545 --> 02:25:50,256
It's no use in any event.
Take my boot off, will you, Wicks?

1297
02:25:50,423 --> 02:25:52,967
Hello, 30 Corps.

1298
02:25:53,134 --> 02:25:55,594
Oh, God!

1299
02:26:00,558 --> 02:26:03,144
We're out of ammunition anyway.

1300
02:26:04,728 --> 02:26:07,440
Right. Off you go, Wicks.
Join the rest of the lads.

1301
02:26:07,606 --> 02:26:09,150
Try and get back
to the main force.

1302
02:26:09,358 --> 02:26:11,402
- What about you, sir?
- I'll be all right.

1303
02:26:12,445 --> 02:26:15,239
We just didn't make it
this time, did we?

1304
02:26:21,662 --> 02:26:25,166
Calling 30 Corps.
Come in, please.

1305
02:27:36,362 --> 02:27:38,489
My general says
please take it.

1306
02:27:38,656 --> 02:27:40,491
It's very good chocolate.

1307
02:27:40,658 --> 02:27:43,160
Your planes dropped it to us
yesterday.

1308
02:27:56,590 --> 02:27:57,842
English.

1309
02:28:11,272 --> 02:28:13,524
Action stations!

1310
02:28:13,691 --> 02:28:16,861
God bless
Field Marshal Montgomery.

1311
02:29:59,130 --> 02:30:05,011
Would five minutes
be too much?

1312
02:30:06,762 --> 02:30:08,681
Just five minutes respite.

1313
02:30:11,851 --> 02:30:14,937
Dear God...

1314
02:30:15,104 --> 02:30:17,481
...grant these young men...

1315
02:30:18,691 --> 02:30:22,111
...die in peace and quiet.

1316
02:30:45,134 --> 02:30:47,970
I'm sorry, lads,
but you're going to have to move.

1317
02:30:57,521 --> 02:30:58,940
Please.

1318
02:31:00,107 --> 02:31:02,777
Take my hand.

1319
02:31:05,363 --> 02:31:07,448
We're a bit late
with this one, mate.

1320
02:31:15,081 --> 02:31:18,751
"Surely He shall deliver thee
from the snare of the fowler...

1321
02:31:18,918 --> 02:31:22,713
...and from the noisome pestilence.

1322
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:25,591
He shall cover thee
with His feathers...

1323
02:31:25,758 --> 02:31:28,511
...and under His wings
shalt thou trust.

1324
02:31:28,719 --> 02:31:32,014
His truth shall be
thy shield and buckler."

1325
02:31:51,158 --> 02:31:53,452
There you go. Head back.

1326
02:31:54,662 --> 02:31:57,123
You'll be all right now, chum.

1327
02:32:03,713 --> 02:32:06,340
Can it get worse?

1328
02:32:06,507 --> 02:32:09,635
Oh, yes, much worse.

1329
02:32:25,985 --> 02:32:28,529
Bring up the bulldozer.

1330
02:32:39,498 --> 02:32:41,417
Stretcher bearer!

1331
02:32:44,921 --> 02:32:46,047
Help me!

1332
02:32:47,590 --> 02:32:48,883
Stretcher.

1333
02:32:52,303 --> 02:32:54,764
Easy, now. Take it easy.

1334
02:32:56,015 --> 02:32:58,893
Morphia. I must have morphia.

1335
02:32:59,060 --> 02:33:02,104
Morphia is only for
the people who are really hurt.

1336
02:33:02,271 --> 02:33:04,732
I thought I was really hurt.

1337
02:33:04,899 --> 02:33:06,776
Well, you're wrong.

1338
02:33:07,985 --> 02:33:11,113
I asked him to come over,
but Dr. Spaander does agree with me.

1339
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:14,408
- We've got to do something about them.
- Yes, what? Good day, Doctor.

1340
02:33:14,575 --> 02:33:19,580
General Urquhart, we have no more space
and we have no more supplies.

1341
02:33:19,747 --> 02:33:21,999
And since a prisoner of war...

1342
02:33:22,166 --> 02:33:24,293
...has more chance
than no chance at all...

1343
02:33:24,460 --> 02:33:26,754
I have a mind
to ask the Germans...

1344
02:33:26,921 --> 02:33:29,590
...to accept our wounded
into their hospitals...

1345
02:33:29,757 --> 02:33:32,510
...if we could arrange evacuation.

1346
02:33:32,677 --> 02:33:35,847
- Have I your permission to try?
- Certainly.

1347
02:33:36,013 --> 02:33:39,559
If Weaver agrees.
But I hardly think the Germans will.

1348
02:33:39,725 --> 02:33:43,980
Those are our guns out there.
That's 30 Corps.

1349
02:33:44,147 --> 02:33:47,441
I don't think my permission
is going to be your major problem.

1350
02:33:58,619 --> 02:34:00,580
I've come with a message
from General Urquhart.

1351
02:34:00,788 --> 02:34:02,665
How you manage that?

1352
02:34:02,832 --> 02:34:05,209
I swam the Rhine, sir.

1353
02:34:05,376 --> 02:34:08,379
I'm afraid the radios
are all up the spout.

1354
02:34:08,546 --> 02:34:12,216
The general asks if you'll
get your men across the river.

1355
02:34:12,383 --> 02:34:15,511
We've been holding out
for six days now.

1356
02:34:15,678 --> 02:34:18,347
Any help at all would be
of considerable assistance.

1357
02:34:19,432 --> 02:34:21,434
You swim back with reply?

1358
02:34:21,642 --> 02:34:22,810
Yes, sir.

1359
02:34:23,978 --> 02:34:26,606
Well, we can't swim...

1360
02:34:26,814 --> 02:34:29,066
...not with equipment.

1361
02:34:29,233 --> 02:34:31,903
We have small rubber boats,
that's all.

1362
02:34:32,069 --> 02:34:34,614
I'm afraid rubber dinghies
may be a bit flimsy for the Rhine, sir.

1363
02:34:34,822 --> 02:34:36,699
I agree.

1364
02:34:41,871 --> 02:34:44,499
Tell the general we're coming.

1365
02:34:44,665 --> 02:34:46,709
We're coming tonight.

1366
02:34:46,876 --> 02:34:48,795
Yes, sir.

1367
02:37:42,510 --> 02:37:44,470
Not possible.

1368
02:37:44,637 --> 02:37:49,100
If you would just say yes,
it would be very possible.

1369
02:37:49,267 --> 02:37:52,520
Forgive me,
but there is a battle...

1370
02:37:52,687 --> 02:37:54,981
...and we are in the process
of winning it.

1371
02:37:56,190 --> 02:37:59,610
Winning and losing
is not our concern.

1372
02:37:59,777 --> 02:38:02,613
Living or dying is.

1373
02:38:04,365 --> 02:38:06,659
Cease fire...

1374
02:38:06,826 --> 02:38:09,912
...one more hour, two...

1375
02:38:10,121 --> 02:38:12,415
...just to evacuate our wounded.

1376
02:38:13,708 --> 02:38:18,421
Afterwards you can kill us
as much as you want to.

1377
02:38:24,302 --> 02:38:26,262
General Ludwig.

1378
02:39:07,428 --> 02:39:09,514
- Will you thank him, please?
- I just did.

1379
02:39:10,390 --> 02:39:12,767
Please, you can go.

1380
02:40:42,523 --> 02:40:44,484
How short are we? A mile?

1381
02:40:53,451 --> 02:40:57,330
Why don't we just try
to bash through?

1382
02:40:57,497 --> 02:40:59,999
For God's sake,
it must be worth it.

1383
02:41:00,208 --> 02:41:03,378
They're trying to force Urquhart
away from the river.

1384
02:41:04,629 --> 02:41:06,965
Now, once they do that...

1385
02:41:07,131 --> 02:41:10,969
...once they've got him surrounded,
he'll be annihilated.

1386
02:41:11,135 --> 02:41:13,179
Not in Monty's plan at all.

1387
02:41:14,514 --> 02:41:16,849
Have we replaced the boats
we lost at Nijmegen?

1388
02:41:18,643 --> 02:41:19,727
Yes.

1389
02:41:21,271 --> 02:41:22,730
Well?

1390
02:41:25,233 --> 02:41:26,734
Well, then?

1391
02:41:33,074 --> 02:41:36,244
Well, that's it then.
We're pulling them out.

1392
02:41:42,584 --> 02:41:44,544
It was Nijmegen.

1393
02:41:44,711 --> 02:41:49,173
It was the single road
getting to Nijmegen.

1394
02:41:49,340 --> 02:41:51,551
No, it was after Nijmegen.

1395
02:41:55,638 --> 02:41:57,181
And the fog...

1396
02:41:57,390 --> 02:41:59,225
...in England.

1397
02:42:03,563 --> 02:42:06,232
It doesn't matter what it was.

1398
02:42:06,399 --> 02:42:09,277
When one man says to another,
"Today let's play the war game"...

1399
02:42:11,529 --> 02:42:13,448
...everybody dies.

1400
02:42:16,993 --> 02:42:18,411
"Withdraw"?

1401
02:42:21,164 --> 02:42:24,250
Two days, they said.
We've been here nine.

1402
02:42:25,752 --> 02:42:28,588
One bloody mile. You'd think
they could accomplish that.

1403
02:42:30,298 --> 02:42:32,717
- Hancock, here are another two.
- All right. Thank you.

1404
02:42:32,884 --> 02:42:35,220
They're the last two
I could find.

1405
02:42:35,386 --> 02:42:37,388
Charles?

1406
02:42:37,597 --> 02:42:40,475
We've been given
our marching orders.

1407
02:42:42,644 --> 02:42:45,730
If they discover we're leaving,
they'll go all out to destroy us.

1408
02:42:45,897 --> 02:42:48,066
So we must take every precaution.

1409
02:42:48,233 --> 02:42:50,902
I've designed this
like a collapsing bag.

1410
02:42:51,110 --> 02:42:53,404
Macdonald here has agreed
to man the wireless...

1411
02:42:53,571 --> 02:42:55,573
...in order to give the Germans
something to listen to.

1412
02:42:55,740 --> 02:42:59,828
All the padres and medical staff
have volunteered to stay behind as well.

1413
02:42:59,994 --> 02:43:02,080
Now, the wounded
who are too bad to move...

1414
02:43:02,288 --> 02:43:04,582
...will replace the men firing...

1415
02:43:04,749 --> 02:43:07,335
...so our defense
will seem as before.

1416
02:43:07,502 --> 02:43:09,629
By the time the Germans
find out what's happening...

1417
02:43:09,796 --> 02:43:12,757
...we should all be safely
across the river.

1418
02:43:14,133 --> 02:43:16,928
- Pleasant journey.
- Thank you, sir.

1419
02:43:46,124 --> 02:43:48,960
- Are you all right, laddie?
- Thank you, sir.

1420
02:45:12,502 --> 02:45:15,964
I'm beginning to believe
we're actually going to make it, sir.

1421
02:45:16,172 --> 02:45:18,133
I thought everyone knew
God was a Scotsman.

1422
02:45:52,333 --> 02:45:54,335
Come on. Don't hang about.

1423
02:46:55,939 --> 02:46:58,525
General Browning will be down
right away, sir.

1424
02:47:04,781 --> 02:47:08,618
He wondered if you perhaps
might like to change.

1425
02:47:08,785 --> 02:47:11,371
- Change?
- Your clothes, sir.

1426
02:47:13,415 --> 02:47:15,375
No, thanks.

1427
02:47:31,349 --> 02:47:33,268
Hello, Roy.

1428
02:47:36,104 --> 02:47:37,188
How are you?

1429
02:47:39,107 --> 02:47:41,901
I'm not sure
that I'll know for a while.

1430
02:47:43,194 --> 02:47:45,071
But I'm sorry about
the way it worked out.

1431
02:47:47,365 --> 02:47:48,992
You did all you could.

1432
02:47:50,910 --> 02:47:53,580
Yes, but did everyone else?

1433
02:47:57,459 --> 02:47:59,502
They've got a bed for you upstairs,
if you want it.

1434
02:48:01,463 --> 02:48:03,923
I took 10,000 men into Arnhem.

1435
02:48:04,132 --> 02:48:06,384
I've come out with less than 2,000.

1436
02:48:06,551 --> 02:48:09,054
I don't feel much like sleeping.

1437
02:48:10,013 --> 02:48:11,473
Quite.

1438
02:48:14,017 --> 02:48:17,187
I've just been on to Monty.

1439
02:48:17,354 --> 02:48:19,522
He's very proud and pleased.

1440
02:48:20,690 --> 02:48:22,734
- Pleased?
- Of course.

1441
02:48:24,444 --> 02:48:27,697
He thinks Market Garden
was 90/ successful. 

1442
02:48:28,907 --> 02:48:31,618
But what do you think?

1443
02:48:33,495 --> 02:48:37,374
Well, as you know, I've always thought
we tried to go a bridge too far.

1444
02:49:08,905 --> 02:49:10,323
Mind his head.

1445
02:49:15,495 --> 02:49:17,122
Thanks, Taff.

1446
02:50:23,063 --> 02:50:28,401
Abide with me

1447
02:50:28,568 --> 02:50:31,029
Fast falls

1448
02:50:31,196 --> 02:50:36,159
The eventide

1449
02:50:36,368 --> 02:50:39,746
The darkness

1450
02:50:39,913 --> 02:50:42,624
Deepens

1451
02:50:42,791 --> 02:50:48,463
Lord, with me abide

1452
02:50:48,630 --> 02:50:51,841
When other

1453
02:50:52,050 --> 02:50:55,637
Helpers fail

1454
02:50:55,804 --> 02:50:59,349
And comforts flee

1455
02:51:01,059 --> 02:51:05,564
Help of the helpless

1456
02:51:05,730 --> 02:51:09,109
O abide

1457
02:51:09,276 --> 02:51:12,737
With me

1458
02:51:15,240 --> 02:51:20,370
Hold Thou Thy cross

1459
02:51:20,579 --> 02:51:25,959
Before my closing eyes

1460
02:51:28,253 --> 02:51:32,299
Shine through the gloom
