to win victory
before the end of the year.

27

It is with reluctance that
I bring this subject up again.

28
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:40,401
You are the life

29
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,674
You are the iron men

You are the gay heroes

when you are called upon
to do so.

32
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:52,952
It is not for me to suggest
that any of you...

33
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,721
should stand up and offer
to defend his country.

34
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,832
But I wonder if such a thing
is going through your heads.

35
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,833
I know that
in one of the schools,

36
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,630
the boys have risen up
in the classroom...

37
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,933
and enlisted in a mass.

38
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,871
But, of course, if such a thing
should happen here,

39
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,445
you would not blame me
for a feeling of pride.

40
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,445

that you should not
be allowed to go yet,

42
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:23,512
that you are too young, that you
have homes, mothers, fathers,

43
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,284
that you should not be
torn away.

44
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,826
Are your fathers so forgetful
of their fatherland...

45
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,157
that they would let it perish
rather than you?

46
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,797
Are your mothers so weak
that they cannot send a son...

which gave them birth?

48
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:45,136
And after all,
is a little experience...

49
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:49,008

for a boy?

50
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,345
Is the honor of wearing
a uniform...

51

something from which
we should run?

52
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,982
And if our young ladies
glory in those who wear it,

53
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,183
is that anything
to be ashamed of?

54
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:06,492
I know you have never desired
the adulation of heroes.

55

foremost in battle...

59
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,538

not to be despised.

60

But if losses there must be,

63
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:32,717
then let us remember
the Latin phrase...

64
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,726
which must have come
to the lips of many a Roman...

65
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,353
when he stood embattled
in a foreign land:

66
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:44,196
"Dulce et decorum est
pro patria mori."

67
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:49,068
"Sweet and fitting it is
to die for the fatherland."

68
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,578
Some of you
may have ambitions.

69
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:58,274
I know of one young man who has
great promise as a writer,

70
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,079
and he has written the first act
of a tragedy...

71
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,087
which would be a credit
to one of the masters.

72
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,349
And he is dreaming,
I suppose,

73
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:09,859
of following in the footsteps
of Goethe and Schiller,

74
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,893

What a feast!

509
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:45,439
- Everyone gets two issues.
- [All Shouting]

510
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:47,668
- Get back in line! Get back in line!
- Oh, no!

511
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,675
That won't do.

512
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:52,508
I can't give 80 men
what's meant for 150.

513
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:54,673
[All Grumbling]

514
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,716
Listen.

515
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,912
You drew rations
for the 2nd Company, didn't ya?

516
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,888
Yeah.

517
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,254
All right.
We're the 2nd Company.

518
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:07,295
- [Approving Shouts]
- I've got my orders.

519
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:09,694
- Kat's right.
- We're the 2nd Company.

520
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:11,925
And if only half of us get back,
that's our good luck.

521
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,161
- Come on. Dish it out.
- [Men Shouting] Come on!

522
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:17,170
- No!
- [All] Hey!

523
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:21,299
You're the yellowest baboon
that ever drew a cook wagon,

524
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:23,810
and you're scared...
it shows.

525
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:26,710
All we want to hear out of you
is one more little yip,

526
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,580
and we'll cut ya up
and eat ya raw.

527
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,381
Why, you keep your kitchen
so far back of the lines,

528
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:36,081
we never get anything to eat
until it's cold and we're asleep!

529
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,727
Now, you low-down rat,
get out...

530
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,228
- or we wreck the joint!
- [Approving Shouts]

531
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,661
- Come on! Give us...
- Attention!

532
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:54,640
At ease.

533
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:56,642
What's goin' on here?

534
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:59,611
He's cooked for 150, sir,
and he only wants to give us half.

535
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:06,080
- Looks pretty good.
- Yes, sir.

536
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:10,090
- Serve the whole issue.
The men can use it.
- Yes, sir.

537
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:14,788
- And bring me a plate too.
- Yes, sir.

538
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:17,092
All right. Take it all.
Take everything.

539
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,700
Give 'em honey.
Give 'em what they want.

540
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:23,806
- Fill it up!
- Fill it up!

541
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:27,807
[All Chattering]

542
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,906
- Don't mind me.
- Oh, that's all right. Don't mention it.

543
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:13,186
You know...

544
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,518
I could do with
some more beans.

545
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:19,059
Go help yourself.
There's more over there.

546
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,832
[Groaning]

547
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,026
- It's too far.
- [Kat Chuckling]

548
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:33,473
- I wonder, when are we
going back to the front?
- Tomorrow.

549
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:40,611
It's enough to take away
a man's appetite.

550
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:42,911
You know, if they're gonna
march us in again tomorrow,

551
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,950
we ought to go see
how Kemmerick is.

552
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,952
- That's a good idea.
- Let's do that.

553
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:50,251
- How far is the dressing station?
- About two miles.

554
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:53,521
- We could take his things to him.
- Good.

555
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:57,133
It seemed rotten to think of a thing
like that happening to him,

556
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,291
a nice fellow
like Kemmerick.

557
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,165
Ah, the French certainly deserve
to be punished for starting this war.

558
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,933
Everybody says
it's somebody else.

559
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:07,632
Well, how do they
start a war?

560
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:10,439
Well, one country
offends another.

561
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:12,980
How could one country
offend another?

562
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:17,517
You mean there's a mountain
over in Germany gets mad
at a field over in France?

563
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:22,182
- [All Laughing]
- Well, stupid,
one people offends another.

564
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:24,758
Oh, if that's it,
I shouldn't be here at all.

565
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:26,725
I don't feel offended.

566
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:31,166
It don't apply
to tramps like you.

567
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:33,632
Good. Then I can be
going home right away.

568
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:36,135
- Ah, you just try it.
- [Kat] Yeah. You wanna get shot?

569
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:42,269
- The kaiser and me...
- [Jeering, Snickering]

570
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:46,246
Me and the kaiser felt
just alike about this war.

571
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:49,577
We didn't either of us
want any war, so I'm going home.

572
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:52,779
- He's there already.
- Somebody must have wanted it.

573
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,049
Maybe it was
the English.

574
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:58,125
No, I don't want
to shoot any Englishmen.

575
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:00,796
I never saw one
till I came up here.

576
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:04,957
And I suppose most of them never saw
a German till they came up here.

577
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,764
- No, I'm sure they weren't
asked about it.
- No.

578
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,940
Well...

579
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:13,041
it must be doing
somebody some good.

580
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:18,044
- Not me and the kaiser.
- I think maybe the kaiser wanted a war.

581
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:20,045
You leave us
out of this!

582
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:24,584
I don't see that.

583
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,951
The kaiser's got
everything he needs.

584
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,988
Well, he never
had a war before.

585
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:32,720
Every full-grown emperor
needs one war to make him famous.

586
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:35,387
- Why, that's history.
- Yeah, generals too. They need war.

587
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:38,032
- And manufacturers. They get rich.
- [Murmurs Of Agreement]

588
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,931
I think it's more
a kind of fever.

589
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:43,002
Nobody wants it
in particular,

590
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,336
and then all at once,
there it is.

591
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:48,774
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.

592
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:50,776
And here we are fighting.

593
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:53,108
I'll tell you how
it should all be done.

594
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,318
Whenever there's
a big war comin' on,

595
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:02,013
- you should rope off a big field...
- And sell tickets.

596
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,023
Yeah. And...

597
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:07,595
And on the big day,

598
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:12,258
you should take all the kings
and their cabinets and their generals,

599
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,562
put them in the center
dressed in their underpants,

600
00:56:14,738 --> 00:56:17,229
and let 'em fight it out
with clubs.

601
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:21,138
- The best country wins.
- [All Groan, Murmur]

602
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:24,644
Well, now that Kat's settled everything,
let's go see Kemmerick.

603
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:27,044
- Something interesting
might happen on the way.
- Might cheer him up.

604
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:30,413
Boys, me and the kaiser want you
back in time to march tomorrow.

605
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:32,418
Don't forget.

606
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:34,614
- We'll be back.
- Give the boy my regards.

607
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:42,757
- We'll be back.
- Give the boy my regards.

608
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:45,130
[Soldiers Chattering]

609
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:56,535
There he is.

610
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:59,910
- Hello, Kemmerick.
- How are ya?
- How's it going?

611
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,018
How are things going?
Are they looking after you all right?

612
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:06,121
How are they treating you?
Franz?

613
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:08,120
[Groaning]

614
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:11,323
They're robbers here.

615
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:15,327
Robbers.

616
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:19,866
They stole my watch!

617
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:22,800
I always told you, nobody
should carry as good a watch as that.

618
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:28,103
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.

619
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,610
Do you feel all right?

620
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:36,012
- Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost so much blood.

621
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:38,882
- Just eat decently
and you'll get well again.
- Oh, no.

622
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:43,457
You must eat. That's the main thing.
It looks good too.

623
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:50,989
I have such a terrible pain
in my foot.

624
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:56,138
Every toe
on my right foot hurts.

625
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:03,036
Well, how can your foot hurt
when your leg's been...

626
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:09,412
[Hysterically]
I know what you mean!

627
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:12,555
I know!
I know now!

628
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,818
They cut my leg off.

629
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:23,562
Why didn't they tell me?
Why... Why didn't they tell me?

630
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:26,463
- Franz! Franz!
- Now I can't walk anymore!

631
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,695
You must be thankful that you've
come off with only that.

632
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:40,313
I wanted to be
a forester once.

633
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:44,886
You can yet. They make artificial legs
that are wonderful.

634
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:49,491
And you're through too.
You can go home. Think of that.

635
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:52,493
We brought your things
for you. See?

636
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:55,460
Put 'em under the bed.

637
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:05,030
That's a marvelous pair
of boots.

638
00:59:06,576 --> 00:59:08,441
Look at that leather!

639
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:10,476
What comfort.

640
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:12,512
I was just thinking.

641
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:18,952
If you're not going to be using these,
Franz, why don't you leave 'em with us?

642
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:24,953
What good are they to you?
I can use 'em.

643
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:27,322
My boots give me blister
after blister...

644
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:34,860
Well, we'll be going,
Franz.

645
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:38,598
Oh, don't go. Stay just
a little while longer.

646
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:43,271
- I'll come right back.
- We'll be coming soon again, Franz.

647
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:45,539
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye.

648
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:47,546
- Bye.
- Good-bye, Franz.

649
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:50,242
[Albert]
You think he'll last till after mess?

650
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,820
- I don't think...
- Done for.

651
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:57,351
[Paul] Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.

652
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:59,757
[Soldiers]
Good-bye. All right, Paul.

653
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,896
I'm sorry, Paul.

654
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:09,470
I wouldn't touch a thing
of his if he could use it.

655
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:13,598
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire
for him if it'd do him any good.

656
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:17,041
Only... Only why should
some orderly get those boots?

657
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:20,478
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.

658
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:23,983
And good boots
are scarce.

659
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,088
Tell the doctor to come,
please.

660
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:44,898
Doctor, the man in the next bed
would like to see you, sir.

661
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:48,635
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.

662
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,642
Poor little fella.

663
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:04,416
He says next time,
Franz.

664
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:16,701
Do you think
I'll ever get well?

665
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,670
Why, of course.

666
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:26,038
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get over the operation.

667
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:34,889
I don't think so.

668
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:39,118
Franz! Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.

669
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:42,594
They fix up worse things
than that.

670
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,859
Perhaps you'll go
to the convalescent home...

671
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:48,094
in Klosterberg
among the villagers.

672
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:51,763
Then you can look out of the
windows, across the fields...

673
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:55,309
to the two trees
on the horizon.

674
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:58,480
The loveliest time of the year
now when the corn ripens.
