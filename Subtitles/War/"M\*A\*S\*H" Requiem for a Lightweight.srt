1
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:14,920
[Hawkeye] All right, just to
make it interesting, anybody can
open with a pair of 10s...

2
00:01:14,989 --> 00:01:17,480
but only if you're wearing
civilian boxer shorts.

3
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:20,790
[Margaret] Oh, don't be ridiculous.
You can't set a rule like that.

4
00:01:20,862 --> 00:01:24,764
- No, it's dealer's choice, Major.
- Will you accept
a civilian panty girdle?

5
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:28,667
- Tens and boxer shorts.
- That is the most absurd rule
I've ever heard.

6
00:01:28,737 --> 00:01:31,570
- Can anybody open?
- I'll open for 25 cents.

7
00:01:32,907 --> 00:01:36,070
I told ya! I told ya!
You owe me a buck and a half.

<i>[Hawkeye And B.J. Laughing]</i>

9
00:01:38,246 --> 00:01:42,512
I'm out. I blew everything last night
on Radar's cockroach races.

10
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:44,916
He had the winner,
but it come in riderless.

11
00:01:44,986 --> 00:01:47,511
- Riderless?
- The fly fell off.

12
00:01:47,589 --> 00:01:50,581
- I'm in. B.J.?
- I'm in.

13
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:52,683
- Father, you wanna sit in the game?
- Huh?

14
00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:56,754
Oh, yes. Oh, I had the most
extraordinary dream.

15
00:01:56,831 --> 00:02:00,767
I was a cardinal in Rome,
and the pope had a bad cold.

16
00:02:00,835 --> 00:02:04,271
What do you suppose that means,
Sidney? You're the skull jockey.

17
00:02:04,339 --> 00:02:07,433
Well, Freud said
every dream is a wish.

18
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:09,943
One time my uncle dreamt
he was dancing with a whale.

19
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:12,445
When he woke up,
our cow had eaten his pants.

20
00:02:12,514 --> 00:02:15,677
Do you wanna bet, or do you want Sidney
to tell you what that means?

21
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,617
Oh, geez. I'm sorry.
I didn't know it meant anything.

22
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:21,746
- [Hawkeye] You want a loan, Sidney?
- No, I think I'll write a letter.

23
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:24,383
- I've been putting it off.
- You all right?

24
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:27,951
- Yeah. What do l... How do I look?
- Cheerful. I'm worried.

25
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:29,963
- All right. What do you want?
- Two.

26
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:32,261
- [Hawkeye] Who took my cards? Oh.
- Here they are.

27
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,324
- <i>[Hawkeye] You?</i>
- [Radar] Mm-hmm. Two.

28
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:37,894
[Thinking] Dear Sigmund,
I've been feeling somewhat
frustrated lately...

29
00:02:37,972 --> 00:02:40,600
and so I came to
a kind of spa.

30
00:02:40,675 --> 00:02:42,973
The waters are
pretty good here.

31
00:02:43,044 --> 00:02:46,138
And the inmates have an interesting
defense against carnage.

32
00:02:46,214 --> 00:02:49,115
- Too rich for me.
- <i>[Sidney Thinking] Insanity</i>
<i>in the service ofhealth.</i>

33
00:02:49,184 --> 00:02:51,744
- Let me see your openers, Margaret.
- Here.

34
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,085
- I'm not talking about your cards.
- Never mind.

[Barking]

36
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:00,491
- Did you hear that?
- That's great. Can you do a dog?

37
00:03:00,562 --> 00:03:03,258
- Who deals?
- <i>[Sidney Thinking] One of them is</i>
<i>particularly good at it.</i>

38
00:03:03,331 --> 00:03:05,891
- What am I holding the cards for?
- <i>Name of Hawkeye.</i>

39
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:08,663
<i>Couple of weeks ago,</i>

40

<i>that had split two for one.</i>

41
00:03:12,106 --> 00:03:15,234
Good evening, ladies and germs. I'm
sorry I'm late, but my watch stopped.

42
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,279
It had to. It's been
running fast all week.

43
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:21,806
Is this the first time
you've been pregnant?

44
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,154
How long have you had that
throbbing in your wrist?

45
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:30,191
"Noyse! Noyse!"

46
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:34,319
- Did you call me, Doctor?
- Why should I call <i>you</i> "Doctor"?
<i>I'm</i> the surgeon.

47
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:36,955
- Give him his medication.
Somebody's 15 minutes late.
- Right.

48
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:40,899
# Doo, dee-doo, dee-doo
Whoop, dee-dee #

49
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:47,371
- Well, your feet seem to be
coming along just fine.
- It's my head, Doc.

50
00:03:47,442 --> 00:03:51,276
Oh, yes. For a minute there
you had athlete's scalp.

51
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:53,280
Come on.
Give us a little smile.

52
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:58,217
Three bucks. I swear to you.
These earrings go for 7.50 at the Tokyo P.X.

53
00:03:58,286 --> 00:04:00,846
Don't you think hoops
are a little trashy before breakfast?

54
00:04:00,922 --> 00:04:04,983
If I thought it'd get me out,
I'd wear hula hoops in my ears. 2.50?

55
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:08,153
- I'll take 'em for 2.50.
- Sold.

56
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:12,393
I hope I win 'em back. I don't want
the holes in my lobes to close up again.

- What happened?
- He got hit with a chopper blade, sir.

62

If Klinger got hit by a chopper blade,
he'd look like a malted milk.

It was slowing down.
Look what it did to his helmet.

64
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,550

- Ever since he came to,
he only speaks in Arabic, sir.

Gee, what a strange thing.

68

I don't want my wife to worry
when I don't show up at home tonight.

- You go home every night from the war?
- Only weekends.

00:07:20,555 --> 00:07:22,716
Got a little place in Tokyo.

116
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,124

the war's been something that
lasts about... 30 minutes a day.

117
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:30,062
Then it's back to the base
and dinner at the officers' club.

- It's only a war. Why kill yourself?
- Yeah.

Well, I tell ya. If I couldn't fly,
I wouldn't touch this war. You fly much?

123

I was shot out of a cannon once
by the irate husband of a bearded lady.

124
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:58,487
It's beautiful up there. At 20,000 feet,
the sky is a brilliant blue.

125
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:01,119
You fly for a while
in that stillness.

126
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:04,028
Then you take a reading,
press a button, and drop your load.

127
00:08:04,098 --> 00:08:06,089
You've never seen the people
you've been bombing?

128
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:09,295
Nah. Never.
I'm a really lucky guy.

129
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,533
- Flying so high with
your head in the sky.
- Yeah.

130
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:19,105
I can't understand why
you call this place the Swamp.

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,149
We were thinking of calling it
the Latrine, but that name was taken.

132
00:08:22,216 --> 00:08:24,878
- That's a private letter.
- Then why'd you leave it under your pillow?

133
00:08:24,952 --> 00:08:28,432
Can I have that? I want to erase
anything nice I said about you guys.

134
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:30,465
Uh, Sidney,
you're a psychiatrist.

135
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:33,992
Don't you think writing a letter
to Sigmund Freud is a little crazy?

136
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:36,005
Who better than he
would understand?

137
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:38,007
- Well, now that makes sense.

00:08:38,075 --> 00:08:41,841
We couldn't help but notice that
you came for the poker game
and stayed for two weeks.

139
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,971
I just wanted
a little vacation.

140
00:08:44,048 --> 00:08:47,484
Sidney, Biarritz is a vacation.
The Swiss Alps is a vacation.

141
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:50,816
This is a fungus convention
at Atlantic City.

142
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:53,356
There's something special
about this place.

143
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:57,656

a little low on that right now.

144
00:08:57,728 --> 00:09:00,629
- Would you like to talk about it?
- Well...

145
00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:03,029
winter's the busy season
for shrinks here.

146
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,728
The days get shorter.
The nights get colder.

147
00:09:05,803 --> 00:09:10,001
I was getting 15 cases a week of total
crack-ups. Can I have some of that?

148
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:15,003
Business was too good.
I was losing people.

149
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:17,411
Sidney, we all lose patients.

150
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:22,676
Actually, the straw that broke my back
was this one kid who heard voices...

151
00:09:22,753 --> 00:09:25,381
telling him to kill himself.

152
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:27,481
I spent a lot of time with him.

153
00:09:29,126 --> 00:09:32,027
One day he was
very calm, relaxed.

154
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:35,896
Sometimes that's a signal
they've made a decision.

155
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:39,902
Only somehow...
I missed it.

156
00:09:42,706 --> 00:09:45,573
And that night,

I wasn't doing my work.

Well, well, well. So the doctor
can't cure himself, huh?

161
00:10:08,532 --> 00:10:12,059

- Just to look around.

for the Republican Club...

from the camera.

301
00:18:44,803 --> 00:18:47,533
Frank, maybe she's just trying
to find out who she is.

302
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:49,540
That doesn't mean
she's leaving you.

believe in the sanctity of marriage...

no matter how ugly
or disgusting it gets.

before I divorce her.

306
00:18:57,549 --> 00:18:59,779

from reality.

313
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,894
Some people even manage to grow.

314
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:19,233
- <i>Radar, for instance.</i>
- Come on! Come on!

315
00:19:19,304 --> 00:19:23,297
<i>In many ways,</i>
<i>he's still as innocent and naive</i>
<i>as the local orphans he plays with.</i>

316
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,935
<i>And yet this boy</i>
<i>keeps this unit</i>...

317
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:29,276
<i>this state of chaos</i>...
<i>running smoothly.</i>

318
00:19:29,348 --> 00:19:33,079
Uh, sir, I have some papers
for you to sign before you go to bed.

319
00:19:33,152 --> 00:19:36,417
Just in time, Radar. I was just saying
good night to Mrs. Potter.

320
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:38,422
Say good night
for me too, sir.

321
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,015
- Unless she's in
her nightgown or something.
- [Chuckles]

322
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:43,493
I'll ignore that.

323
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:45,621
Uh, sir, here's
the mess requisition.

324
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:48,495
- I ordered 500 hams.
- Isn't that kind of a lot?

325
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:53,129
Well, Sergeant Skinowsky from
over the 309th says he'll trade
me ice cream and fruit for ham.

326
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:56,072
I figured it might be a good
idea to order a few extra.

327
00:19:56,141 --> 00:19:58,109
Good boy, Radar.

328
00:19:58,177 --> 00:20:01,840
I haven't had fruit for so long,
my colon will think it's a stickup.

329
00:20:01,914 --> 00:20:04,508
That's a good one, sir.

330
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:08,314
- This is the updated patients list.
- Right.

331
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:13,791
- What's in the box?
- Um, it's the ambulance driver's
personal effects, sir.

332
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:17,727
It's going out
to Graves Registration.

333
00:20:17,796 --> 00:20:21,562
- Did you write a little note
for me to his folks?
- Yes, sir. It's right here.

334
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:25,660
I never know what to say.
Of all the lousy duties I've
had to perform in this service...

335
00:20:25,737 --> 00:20:27,898
that's always
been the lousiest.

336
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:29,907
You can change it
if you want, sir.

337
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:32,967
I'm not sure all the words
are exactly right or anything.

338
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:35,104
"Dear Mr. And Mrs. O'Donnell...

339
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,378
"It is with real deep sadness
that I must tell you
of the death of your son.

340
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:41,942
"You can be
very, very proud of Jerry.

341
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,113
"He never took a human life,
and he died...

342
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:47,955
"while he was trying to save
the lives of five other fellows.

343
00:20:48,026 --> 00:20:50,358
"He was rushing them

344
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:53,523
"which is short for
evacuation hospital, in Seoul...

345

"when his ambulance overturned.

346
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:58,899
"He was a real good boy,
Mr. And Mrs. O'Donnell...

347
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:01,735
"and I know he loved you
both very much.

348
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:07,074
"He spoke of you often
to my company clerk,
Corporal Walter O'Reilly.

349
00:21:07,145 --> 00:21:09,477
"We were proud of him at MASH...

350
00:21:09,548 --> 00:21:14,451
and we'll miss Jerry...
very, very much."

351
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,751
- Thank you, Radar. Don't change a word.
- Thank you, sir.

352
00:21:22,427 --> 00:21:26,420
[Thinking] The one person
I can't figure out, even with
all you've taught me, Sigmund...

353
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:28,796
is B.J. Hunnicutt.

354
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:32,030
- <i>He's an enigma with si</i>z<i>e- 13 shoes.</i>
- Get that guy to pre-op now.

355
00:21:32,104 --> 00:21:34,834
<i>In the midst of the most</i>
<i>terrific enterprise ever devised...</i>

356
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:37,933
<i>to separate a person's brains</i>
<i>from his buns...</i>

357
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,740
<i>B.J. Goes calmly on.</i>

358
00:21:40,812 --> 00:21:42,973
<i>I envy his serenity.</i>

359
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:47,781
- <i>Although there must be a volcano</i>
<i>under there somewhere.</i>
- Oh, give me that.

360
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:49,844
- [Screams]
- [Laughing]

361
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,786
<i>[Water Running]</i>

362
00:22:08,574 --> 00:22:13,170
- Oh, hi.
- You! You're the practical joker?

363
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:15,713
It certainly looks
that way, doesn't it?

364
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:17,715
- Would you like to help?
- Sure.

365
00:22:17,783 --> 00:22:19,774
What do I do?

366
00:22:22,654 --> 00:22:26,055
As loud as you can,
shout, "Air raid!"

367
00:22:27,993 --> 00:22:30,553
Air raid! Air raid!

368
00:22:30,629 --> 00:22:32,597
Air raid!

369
00:22:32,664 --> 00:22:35,428
Air raid! Air raid!

370
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,627
Air raid!

371
00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:41,966
[Gasping]

372
00:22:44,776 --> 00:22:48,906
"Colonel Potter is pleased to announce
that today is the first day of spring.

00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:51,279

378
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:04,962
Oh, thank you.

379
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:08,727
"And now, in honor of
the first day of spring..."

380
00:23:13,705 --> 00:23:15,639
Okay, that's it.

381
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:30,049
- You leaving, Sidney?
- Afraid so.

382
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:32,955
- Hate to be cured and run.
- You feel better?

383
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:36,984
Yeah, I think I do a little.
It's like spring at MASH.

384
00:23:37,062 --> 00:23:41,158
If you can't find it, and you can't
feel it, you just go ahead and make it.

385
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:44,760
Somewhere in here,
I'm coaxing a little bud to grow.

386
00:23:44,836 --> 00:23:48,602
- Meanwhile, I'm goin' back to work.
- See ya at the game next week?

387
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:52,804
Yes, I'll be here with $20 in my pants
and three aces up my sleeve.

388
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:55,176
Show a little imagination.
Don't make them all spades.

389
00:24:12,464 --> 00:24:14,455
Clamp.

00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:17,934
<i>[Sidney Thinking] They look</i>

391
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:22,531

- <i>On the surface they may seem</i>

00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:27,578
<i>Ah, Sigmund, underneath.</i>
