1
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:08,906
This is a true story.

2
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:13,001
I've told it as it happened,
unadorned.

3
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,380
Here, under German occupation,

4
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:28,460
10,000 men suffered
at the hands of the Nazis.

5
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:32,554
7,000 died.

6
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:48,510
A MAN ESCAPED

7
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,741
OR

8
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:55,480
THE WIND BLO WETH
WHERE IT LISTETH

9
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,913
I could feel
I was being watched.

10
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,852
I didn't dare move.

11
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,382
Nothing broken,
but I wasn't a pretty sight.

12
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,878
I cleaned myself up.

13
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,181
The charges against me
were so heavy,

14
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,622
and I'd aggravated them so.

15
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,990
Why didn't they shoot me?

16
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,927
In the courtyard,
I got used to the idea of dying.

17
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,124
I would have preferred
immediate execution.

18
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,771
My neighbor's knocking
was of no help.

19
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,508
My courage abandoned me
for a moment, and I cried.

20
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:31,623
I slept so soundly
the guards had to wake me up.

21
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:40,432
Get up!

22
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,235
Instinctively,
I pretended to be too weak.

23
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:55,541
I made enormous efforts
just to sit up.

24
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,220
Did that little trick
save my life?

25
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,062
They threw me back,
and I was alone again.

26
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,339
My cell was less
than 3 meters by 2.

27
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,313
It was furnished sparsely:

28
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,352
A wooden frame with a mattress,
two blankets.

29
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,353
In a recess by the door,
a sanitary pail.

30
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,829
And set in the wall,
a stone shelf.

31
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,802
This shelf enabled me
to reach the window.

32
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,816
In the courtyard
in front of me...

33
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,816
three men,
well dressed and clean shaven,

34
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,421
circulated freely.

35
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,523
Be careful.
I'll be back.

36
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,478
- Your name?
- Fontaine.

37
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,916
I'm Terry.

38
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,021
Can I get messages out?

39
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,281
I know a way.

40
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,924
I knew I had to be wary.

41
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,596
Catch this.

42
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,010
Because a stranger
"knew a way"

43
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,016
everything had already
changed for me.

44
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:37,870
Despite the handcuffs,

45
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,171
I managed to wash my face
and wounds.

46
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,626
I was soon able to communicate
with my neighbor.

47
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,861
A young blacksmith,

48
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,165
he killed a German
during a brawl.

49
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,796
He was awaiting
the firing squad.

50
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,203
He was 19.

51
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,548
With his string
and my handkerchief,

52
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,745
I made a sort of sack.

53
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,353
Give me your letters tomorrow.

54
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,326
To give my family hopes
I myself didn't have...

55
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:06,898
but mainly to warn my leaders
that the transmitter I was using

56
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,729
was helping the Germans,
who had broken our code.

57
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,133
I decided to run the risk.

58
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,568
And what a risk!

59
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,268
Giving letters to a stranger

60
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,470
was putting myself and my group
in great danger.

61
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,819
We could have been seen
or taken by surprise.

62
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,026
Do you have a pin?

63
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:38,656
A pin?

64
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:39,765
Wait.

65
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,003
He went towards
the women's barracks.

66
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,521
A gift from them.

67
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,535
On the paper,
written by a woman,

68
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,405
the word "Courage."

69
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,512
There was also the pin.

70
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,613
My neighbor had explained how,
but it took a while.

71
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,279
I didn't think it possible.

72
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,171
I stretched my arms
and my sore wrists.

73
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,640
I felt a sudden sense
of victory.

74
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,639
As a special favor,

75
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,752
the head guard allowed Terry
to see his daughter.

76
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,319
I learned this much later.

77
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,819
I had no idea of the risks

78
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,855
he and his daughter
were running.

79
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:15,051
Once back home, she stamped
and posted the letters.

80
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,289
Your letters left yesterday.
They'll arrive today.

81
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:20,489
Thank you.

82
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,473
You've done your duty.

83
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,049
That should help you make it.

84
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,482
Look!

85
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,525
Be careful.

86
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,103
So, Lieutenant Fontaine.

87
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,637
Have you accepted your failure?

88
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,648
Let me be frank.

89
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,946
I'd have jumped
from the car too.

90
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,986
Now promise me
you'll no longer try to escape.

91
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,216
I promise.

92
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:25,861
What was this game?

93
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,556
He obviously didn't believe me.

94
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,760
As for me, I decided to escape
as soon as possible.

95
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,745
Did he expect to see me
jumping at my grub?

96
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,053
My first meal in four days.

97
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:02,059
I spent more and more time
at the window.

98
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,931
I studied the courtyard,
the walls, and the infirmary.

99
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,799
Unconsciously,
I was getting ready.

100
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,716
I knew that executions
took place within the prison.

101
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,822
A terrible thought
crossed my mind.

102
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,532
He was there.

103
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,192
I spent the day tapping
the Battalion Song

104
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,803
which he'd asked to learn.

105
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,500
That was all the help
I could give him.

106
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,605
The next day,
the head guard came for me.

107
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,385
Jacket.

108
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,490
Towel.

109
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:13,355
I left the first floor
for cell 107 on the top floor.

110
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,458
On my right, no one.
An empty cell.

111
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,196
On my left, a neighbor
who didn't answer my tapping.

112
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:31,072
I stared at their faces,
to see what they were like.

113
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,802
I also stared at the walls.

114
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,711
Newcomer?

115
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,615
I was downstairs
for 15 days...

116
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:42,981
or 15 years!

117
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,316
You get used to it.

118
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,053
Take it from me.

119
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,753
My name is Hebrard.

120
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,021
No talking!

121
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,121
Mine is Fontaine.

122
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,941
After emptying our pails
and washing our faces,

123
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,418
we'd go back to our cells
for another 24 hours.

124
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,484
Nothing to do, no news,
living in terrifying solitude,

125
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:49,246
we were a hundred or so
awaiting our fate.

126
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,249
I had no doubt about mine.

127
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,382
To escape.
To flee.

128
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,593
Luck and idleness
gave me my first chance.

129
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,801
I often sat facing my door,

130
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,336
with nothing to do
besides staring at it.

131
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,870
It was made of two panels
of six oak boards,

132
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,914
set in frames equally thick.

133
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,779
In a crack between two boards

134
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,409
I saw that the wood joining them
wasn't oak.

135
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,955
It was another color:
Beechwood, or poplar.

136
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:28,457
There was definitely a way
of taking apart this door.

137
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,734
I needed an iron spoon.

138
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,070
Pewter and aluminum
were too soft.

139
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,441
I had to wait out
several meals.

140
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,838
I made a kind of chisel.

141
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,016
No, the boards weren't attached

142
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,816
by mortise-and-tenon joints
in the same oak,

143
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,654
but by strips of soft wood
that my tool could pick away at.

144
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,420
I figured I would need
4 or 5 days

145
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:39,757
to dig through one strip,

146
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,763
by cutting or chipping away
the wood.

147
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,099
But each evening
at the same time,

148
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,211
I had to get some air.

149
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,525
I couldn't work fast,
because of the noise I made

150
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,725
and the constant fear
of being caught.

151
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,911
I kept having
to sweep under the door

152
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,542
with a piece of straw
from my broom.

153
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,809
Fontaine, are you there?

154
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,453
Is that you, Terry?

155
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,052
At last. I missed you.

156
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,619
I'm leaving.

157
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,188
They're letting you go?

158
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,298
They're taking me
God knows where.

159
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,494
How did he avoid the guards
and get to my cell?

160
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,128
I never knew.

161
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,574
My neighbor downstairs?

162
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,207
Shot two days ago.

163
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,542
Farewell.

164
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:42,754
Terry's departure,

165
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,879
and the death
of that unseen friend,

166
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,456
left me in despair.

167
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,153
I kept on working.

168
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,661
It stopped me from thinking.

169
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,663
I had to open this door.

170
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,359
I had no other plans.

171
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,398
A new inmate,
Pastor de Leyris,

172
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,940
took on my trust
and my need for friendship.

173
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,241
They arrested me at my pulpit.

174
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:07,470
I couldn't take anything.

175
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,374
Nothing?

176
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:12,711
I used to dream of being alone
someday with my Bible...

177
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,614
I don't have a Bible,
but I have a pencil.

178
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,055
That's plenty.

179
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,127
You have to keep busy...
write, try staying sane.

180
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,197
I do.

181
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,639
Three boards
would give me room enough.

182
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,536
Facing me,
someone kept guard.

183
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,539
It made my job a lot easier.

184
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,576
But my neighbor's silence
troubled me.

185
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,993
We can talk.
They're all downstairs.

186
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,306
Are you scared?

187
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,105
I knew he was there.
I was sure of it.

188
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:15,695
He scared me so much,
I no longer dared touch my door.

189
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,239
I plugged up the holes

190
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,366
with paper
I'd soiled on the floor.

191
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,770
He looked at us, distraught.

192
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,776
That evening at the window,
Blanchet...

193
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,244
that was his name...

194
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,377
Dollars, Mr. Blanchet?
Dollars belonging to you?

195
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,488
No, to a Jewish lady.
I'd never seen her before.

196
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,419
She gave them to me
the day she was captured.

197
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:40,751
How did they find out?

198
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,519
A letter in a pile of laundry.

199
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,753
They'll let you go.

200
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:44,919
No.

201
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,497
What can I do for you?

202
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:48,530
Nothing.

203
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,294
There must be something.

204
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,733
If you want to help me,
stop scratching.

205
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,736
You'll get the whole floor
punished.

206
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:22,323
After three weeks,
working as quietly as possible,

207
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,300
I was able to separate,
lengthwise, three boards.

208
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,871
But they were still
in the frame,

209
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,975
fastened by joints
which bent my spoon.

210
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:01,270
To dislodge them from the frame
I needed another spoon.

211
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,533
Only then could I force them
hard enough.

212
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:08,643
The Bible?

213
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,377
I'm lucky.

214
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:13,484
A miracle!

215
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:16,383
Since yesterday,
everything is different.

216
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:17,852
Silence! No talking!

217
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,693
I'm lucky too.

218
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,943
I busted the frame,
but more than I'd intended.

219
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,982
I was able to put the piece
back in place.

220
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,444
Why do it?

221
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:28,574
To fight.

222
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,086
Fight against the walls,
against myself, my door.

223
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,156
Mr. Blanchet,
you should fight too.

224
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,189
And hope...

225
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:35,451
Hope what?

226
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,083
To go home. To be free.

227
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,286
Free?

228
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:39,794
Someone's waiting for you...

229
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:40,829
No one.

230
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:41,932
A friend?

231
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,465
I have no friends.

232
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,263
Fight anyway.
Fight for everyone here.

233
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,201
Watching only after yourself...

234
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,499
What do you do, then?

235
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,734
I watch you.
And that gives me courage.

236
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:53,969
If I had courage,
I'd kill myself.

237
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,136
I tried.

238
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,714
I made a noose with my shoelace.
The nail fell.

239
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,478
So?

240
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:02,210
I heard someone knocking.

241
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:05,015
It was me.
Why didn't you answer?

242
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,418
Why?

243
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,233
I was afraid that someone

244
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:25,137
would open or close my door
violently.

245
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,301
Fortunately,
I handled it myself.

246
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,149
- How are you?
- Fine.

247
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,165
His wife denounced him,
betrayed him.

248
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,670
Things like that happen...

249
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,672
In life.

250
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,004
How repulsive.

251
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,945
Her life isn't worth much.

252
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,573
He didn't kill her?

253
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:07,946
Almost.

254
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,553
We thought he'd go crazy.

255
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,882
Now he's another man.

256
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:15,083
His face no longer knows
hatred or suffering.

257
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:16,853
His name is Orsini.

258
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,601
Talking about me, Father?

259
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,705
I said you are courage
incarnate.

260
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:57,932
After one month's work
my door was open.

261
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:46,472
What took a lot of time
was putting it back in place.

262
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,494
Inside, no rounds, no guards.

263
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,879
There was nothing special
about roaming the corridor.

264
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,600
But I had a goal.

265
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:01,825
No food and exercise.

266
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,088
What is it?

267
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,560
It's me. Cell 107.

268
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,794
Impossible.

269
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:13,995
Hold out.

270
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:15,765
If I have to,
I'll come back tomorrow.

271
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,579
His astonishment
made me happy.

272
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,181
That night,
I fell asleep less unhappy.

273
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:39,157
It was you in the corridor.
Don't lie.

274
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,264
It was me.

275
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,923
You'll leave.
How will you do it?

276
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,864
I have absolutely no idea.

277
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,425
The head guard and the Sergeant
slept on the second floor.

278
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,000
The Corporal
on the first floor,

279
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,798
near the door
to which he had the key.

280
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,998
This door remained locked
at night.

281
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,745
I considered
every possible alternative,

282
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,351
and even impossible ones.

283
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:10,716
I made a thousand plans.
None was good.

284
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,219
Read and pray.

285
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,121
God will save you.

286
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,789
Only if we give him a hand.

287
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,528
You never pray?

288
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,260
Sometimes.

289
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,766
When things are bad?

290
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,427
That's easy.

291
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:28,697
Too easy.

292
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:32,104
It would be too easy
if God handled everything.

293
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,644
You're the only one here
to think of escaping.

294
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,147
The only one,
because it's impossible.

295
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:40,409
Take me.

296
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,359
You won't make it.

297
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:28,590
I have to.

298
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:30,724
The military call it
a reconnaissance mission.

299
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,699
Be careful.

300
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,299
If at 10 o'clock,
I'm not in the corridor...

301
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,709
At 10 o'clock,
I was under the skylight.

302
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,068
I feared the worst.

303
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:24,543
The plan for leaving the prison
and how to dismantle your door.

304
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:35,195
Read it and tear it up.

305
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:38,165
Trust me,
but I'm not "courage incarnate."

306
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,995
If you can forgive and forget...

307
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:42,196
I think about it,

308
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,432
but it's as if it happened
to someone else.

309
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,634
Trust me.
It will work.

310
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,420
Twelve meters of rope
strong enough to support a man.

311
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,120
That's what I needed.

312
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:29,886
The netting of the bedstead

313
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,750
provided me with 40 meters
of strong wire.

314
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:50,707
I made my first piece of rope
with the bolster.

315
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,140
I stuffed its horsehair
into the mattress.

316
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:19,627
I folded the cloth in quarters,
the borders inside,

317
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,101
to avoid fraying.

318
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:34,116
I twisted it hard.

319
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,281
Wrapping wire
in the opposite direction

320
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,326
let me keep the cloth twisted.

321
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:54,195
Your door?

322
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:55,635
I'll try again.

323
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:59,004
Try, Orsini.
Try again.

324
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:01,668
Tomorrow I'll tell you
if we split up or not.

325
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,370
What's wrong?

326
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,675
Too long, too complicated.

327
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:06,407
All of it.

328
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,279
It's the only way.

329
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,410
There's another.

330
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:12,983
Say it.

331
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,615
During our walk,
with two ropes and two hooks.

332
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,852
What hooks?

333
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,326
He didn't say.

334
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,397
And the guards doing rounds?

335
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:55,862
He waits till they pass.

336
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,898
Where?

337
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,968
On the roof.

338
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,798
He climbs up the drainpipe
and hides.

339
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,202
In broad daylight,
they'll spot him.

340
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,968
His plan is no good.

341
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:11,578
The next day,
I couldn't talk to Orsini.

342
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,740
He was taken in
for questioning.

343
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,591
So, the questioning?

344
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:31,326
They reassure us, threaten us...
You know their tactics.

345
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,766
Orsini is happy.

346
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,639
- How is everything?
- Fine.

347
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:42,041
You have to keep calm.

348
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,170
- Are you giving up?
- They're freeing me.

349
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:47,306
- Do you believe them?
- Yes.

350
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:49,578
You're right to.

351
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:12,902
Orsini!

352
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,040
I was so closely watched
for 8 days,

353
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:19,444
we lost contact.

354
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,448
What was he up to?

355
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:29,616
I didn't understand.
