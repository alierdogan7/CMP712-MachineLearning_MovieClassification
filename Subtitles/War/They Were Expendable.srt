1
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,430
All boats from Brick.

2
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:13,008
Make them look good. It's the
first time they've seen PT boats.

3
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,427
All boats from Brick.

4
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:38,034
All boats from Brick.
Nice going.

5
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:40,872
Brick from Rusty.

6
00:02:41,073 --> 00:02:42,540
That ought to show them.

7
00:02:58,557 --> 00:03:00,081
They maneuver beautifully, sir.

8
00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:04,018
-A splendid-looking lot of men.
-Thank you, sir.

9
00:04:04,222 --> 00:04:06,122
Gentlemen, we're late.

10
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:11,557
Those boats of yours
maneuver beautifully.

11
00:04:12,364 --> 00:04:15,925
But in wartime, l'm afraid l prefer
something more substantial.

12
00:04:30,982 --> 00:04:33,143
lt's wonderful the way
people believe...

13
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:35,319
...in those high-powered
canoes of yours.

14
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:38,588
Don't you believe in them, Rusty?

15
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:43,359
And l let you sell me that stuff
about a ''command of my own.''

16
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:46,162
You skipper the 34 boat,
don't you?

17
00:04:46,565 --> 00:04:49,932
l used to skipper a cake of soap
in a bathtub too.

18
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:51,602
Secure from inspection.

19
00:04:51,803 --> 00:04:52,861
Dismissed!

20
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:29,496
-Nice show today, fellas.
-Thank you.

21
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:30,538
Lieutenant?

22
00:05:30,742 --> 00:05:31,709
Good evening.

23
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:37,471
l'd like you to meet some boat skippers.
Shorty Long, Lefty Aiken....

24
00:05:38,783 --> 00:05:39,875
What the--?

25
00:06:00,872 --> 00:06:04,740
l want you to meet Andy Andrews.
He just reported. Shorty Long.

26
00:06:04,943 --> 00:06:06,934
-Happy to know you.
-Thank you.

27
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:08,169
Lefty Aiken.

28
00:06:10,115 --> 00:06:11,139
Where's Rusty?

29
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,650
Looks like he's doing his paperwork.

30
00:06:23,628 --> 00:06:25,289
-Andy!
-Hello, Rusty.

31
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:28,125
Lefty said you'd checked in.
What'll it be?

32
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,595
Beer.

33
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:31,564
Figuring your income tax?

34
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,069
No. l had to work out a smooth line...

35
00:06:35,273 --> 00:06:38,242
...to convince the admiral
l belong on a destroyer.

36
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:41,137
So you're really quitting
the squadron?

37
00:06:42,347 --> 00:06:45,009
Can't build a Navy reputation
riding a plywood dream.

38
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,015
What are you aiming at?
Building a reputation...

39
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,450
...or playing for the team?

40
00:06:51,656 --> 00:06:55,217
Look, Brick, for years l've
been taking your fatherly advice.

41
00:06:55,427 --> 00:06:57,088
lt's never been very good.

42
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:59,593
From here on in, l'm a one-man band!

43
00:06:59,798 --> 00:07:02,130
Send in your request.
l'll forward it.

44
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:06,264
How about a beer, Rusty?

45
00:07:06,972 --> 00:07:08,769
Five San Miguels.

46
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:12,004
Nice music.

47
00:07:36,301 --> 00:07:38,394
Oh the monkeys have
No tails in Zamboanga

48
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:42,364
Oh the monkeys have
No tails in Zamboanga

49
00:07:43,575 --> 00:07:45,372
Oh the monkeys have no tails

50
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:48,011
They were bitten off by whales

51
00:07:49,447 --> 00:07:52,416
Oh the monkeys have
No tails in Zamboanga

52
00:07:54,352 --> 00:07:58,152
Oh he won't go back to Subic anymore

53
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:04,460
Oh he won't go back to Subic anymore

54
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:10,425
Oh we'll hoist the jib and spank her

55
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:13,998
And we'll pipe, ''All hands, up anchor!''

56
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,409
But he won't go back to Subic anymore

57
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,100
Lucky dog!

58
00:08:22,013 --> 00:08:24,140
Small beer! Small beer!
Very small beer!

59
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:26,408
Milk! Sarsaparilla! Sarsaparilla!

60
00:08:27,552 --> 00:08:28,814
Ginger ale!

61
00:08:29,387 --> 00:08:31,412
Paint varnish and dash of red peppers!

62
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:35,622
Gentlemen!

63
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:38,318
l want absolute silence.

64
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:41,429
Boats here has a little speech to make.

65
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:44,793
l'm not going to make a speech.

66
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:49,439
Just got something to say.

67
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:54,274
Tomorrow our old pal Doc here
is going out.

68
00:08:54,712 --> 00:08:57,545
He's being paid off after 30 years.

69
00:08:58,249 --> 00:09:01,275
l know most of you kids got a ways
to go before you find out...

70
00:09:01,486 --> 00:09:03,886
...what 30 years in the Navy means.

71
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:05,989
lt means service.

72
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:07,886
Tough and good.

73
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:11,256
lt means serving your country
in peace and in war.

74
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:12,994
So let's raise--

75
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:15,962
We interrupt this program
for an important announcement.

76
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:20,126
This morning, the Sunday calm of
Pearl Harbor was broken by the thunder--

77
00:09:21,072 --> 00:09:23,666
So let's raise our glasses
and drink to Doc...

78
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:26,309
...with all the solemnity that
this occasion demands.

79
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:28,535
To Doc.

80
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,738
Sorry to have to interrupt you.

81
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:31,240
Ladies and gentlemen.

82
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:34,104
l have a very important
announcement to make.

83
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:35,911
This is official.

84
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:39,682
The Japanese have attacked
Pearl Harbor.

85
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:42,581
There are no details.

86
00:10:43,588 --> 00:10:47,115
All Army and Navy personnel
must report to their posts immediately.

87
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:49,556
l repeat:

88
00:10:49,994 --> 00:10:54,124
All Army and Navy personnel
must report to their posts immediately.

89
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:01,138
Let's go, Rusty.

90
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:05,504
Didn't you forget something?

91
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:28,632
Land where my fathers died

92
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:33,866
Land of the pilgrims' pride

93
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:39,174
From every mountainside

94
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:44,779
Let freedom ring

95
00:11:55,693 --> 00:11:56,682
Hold it.

96
00:12:00,598 --> 00:12:03,328
l don't know. l'm just doing
what l'm told. You know.

97
00:12:12,243 --> 00:12:13,938
Any hot dope, Whitey?

98
00:12:14,145 --> 00:12:15,806
Nothing yet, Brick.

99
00:12:22,887 --> 00:12:24,855
That's probably where they'll attack.

100
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:25,886
Carry on.

101
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,557
We'll do our best, sir.

102
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:33,390
This just came in, sir.

103
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:44,403
Gentlemen.

104
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:47,234
You may assume that a state
of war exists between...

105
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:49,572
...the United States
and the Empire of Japan.

106
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:51,471
Govern yourselves accordingly.

107
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,679
My compliments, gentlemen.

108
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,784
Here are the orders.

109
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,263
Hooley.

110
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:21,377
Got anything for us?

111
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:23,444
What do you call that outfit again?

112
00:13:24,849 --> 00:13:27,579
Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three.

113
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:29,776
No orders for you now.
Maybe tomorrow.

114
00:13:29,987 --> 00:13:32,387
What do you want us to do?
Sit on our duffs?

115
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,854
l'll ask the old man.
Stand by.

116
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,533
Have one boat patrol the bay
and one stand by for messenger duty.

117
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:43,985
All boats fueled. Torpedoes will
be loaded within a half-hour.

118
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:45,025
Any dope?

119
00:14:45,229 --> 00:14:47,459
Our orders are to stand by.

120
00:14:47,665 --> 00:14:49,565
Those destroyers aren't standing by.

121
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:52,327
They went down that channel
like a rat race.

122
00:14:52,537 --> 00:14:54,937
Somebody might have given
them orders to go.

123
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,536
You got 20 boxes of 50-caliber there.

124
00:14:58,743 --> 00:14:59,835
Give 1 2 to Lefty.

125
00:15:00,044 --> 00:15:01,068
Now hear this.

126
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,043
Unidentified aircraft approaches Cavite.

127
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:07,581
Unidentified aircraft
approaching Cavite.

128
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:29,165
Those are Jap planes.

129
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,404
Headed this way.

130
00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:41,016
All boats out in the bay.

131
00:15:41,686 --> 00:15:43,950
Follow me, and stand by for signals.

132
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,291
ls that another drill?

133
00:15:53,498 --> 00:15:54,328
Can't be a drill.

134
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:57,000
All we get in this Navy
is drill, drill, drill.

135
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:59,396
Fire in the paint locker!

136
00:16:57,461 --> 00:16:59,053
One formation.

137
00:16:59,263 --> 00:17:00,594
Breaking off.

138
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:02,265
Heading up our way, sir.

139
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:07,900
Stand by to disperse.

140
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:10,465
All boats from 4 1 .
All boats from 4 1 .

141
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:12,040
Stand by for scatter plan.

142
00:17:12,243 --> 00:17:13,733
Stand by for scatter plan.

143
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:15,310
Thank them, Smokey.

144
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:24,178
Scatter plan Baker.

145
00:17:24,388 --> 00:17:26,754
Scatter plan Baker.

146
00:17:31,062 --> 00:17:32,086
Execute.

147
00:17:32,997 --> 00:17:33,929
Execute!

148
00:17:59,957 --> 00:18:02,084
Good shooting, Smokey.
Recognize him?

149
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,487
lknew him well.
Shaved his father.

150
00:18:17,575 --> 00:18:18,974
Get him, Junior!

151
00:18:56,447 --> 00:18:58,677
All boats from 4 1 .

152
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,180
All boats from 4 1 .

153
00:19:01,485 --> 00:19:03,112
Return to base.

154
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,254
Return to base.

155
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,019
Pretty rugged, isn't it?

156
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:51,921
Let's go, Rusty.

157
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:32,331
We've checked everything, sir.
The storeroom's gone.

158
00:21:32,536 --> 00:21:36,597
No torpedoes, no motors,
no spare parts, no nothing.

159
00:21:43,447 --> 00:21:46,211
Wonder if they have
any torpedoes at Corregidor.

160
00:21:47,017 --> 00:21:49,747
-Might be.
-l'll check on it.

161
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,861
Hi.

162
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:03,357
A little rugged.

163
00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:10,900
You got wet clothes on
underneath that blanket?

164
00:22:11,108 --> 00:22:12,939
Just scared.

165
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:16,572
You haven't got
a monopoly on that.

166
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,717
What are you looking at?

167
00:22:24,922 --> 00:22:28,119
Just looking for the Arizona
to come steaming up to base...

168
00:22:28,325 --> 00:22:30,657
...with her 1 4-inch guns blazing...

169
00:22:30,861 --> 00:22:33,421
...and the best cook stoves
in the Navy.

170
00:22:34,565 --> 00:22:36,123
Arizona ?

171
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:45,131
Arizona.

172
00:22:55,552 --> 00:22:59,113
Some Army boys told us a Jap task force
is headed for Lingayen Gulf.

173
00:22:59,323 --> 00:23:02,019
-Planes spotted it at sunset.
-Must be another landing.

174
00:23:02,226 --> 00:23:03,921
Lingayen?

175
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,857
Give me those scissors, Doc.

176
00:23:08,065 --> 00:23:11,034
That's only about
200 miles from here.

177
00:23:12,436 --> 00:23:13,801
Two thirty-five.

178
00:23:14,004 --> 00:23:15,767
Why don't we knock those babies off?

179
00:23:15,973 --> 00:23:19,409
What with? A cake of soap
and a bathtub? Give me that pencil.

180
00:23:29,586 --> 00:23:32,714
Mr. Brickley, the admiral, sir.
Right away.

181
00:23:33,424 --> 00:23:35,449
Check your gasoline.

182
00:23:36,193 --> 00:23:37,490
Feel better?

183
00:23:38,262 --> 00:23:39,627
Take over.

184
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:44,364
Line up your engines, check all boats.
Step on it, men.

185
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:46,399
Fire in the paint locker.

186
00:23:55,245 --> 00:23:57,372
-Yes?
-Brickley.

187
00:23:57,848 --> 00:23:59,713
Mr. Brickley, sir.

188
00:24:02,219 --> 00:24:03,186
You sent for me?

189
00:24:03,387 --> 00:24:07,153
Yes, get a boat ready
to move my staff to Corregidor.

190
00:24:08,726 --> 00:24:11,593
You'll run messenger trips
between Manila and The Rock.

191
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:15,262
Work out a schedule
with the Chief of Staff.

192
00:24:18,635 --> 00:24:21,433
Cavite is finished as a base.

193
00:24:21,805 --> 00:24:24,968
Move your outfit
to Sisiman Cove on Bataan.

194
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:29,976
ls that all, sir?

195
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,772
That's all.

196
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:40,148
ls it true that a Jap task force
is moving into Lingayen Gulf, sir?

197
00:24:42,226 --> 00:24:43,887
Type that and send it.

198
00:24:47,297 --> 00:24:48,889
Sit down, Brickley.

199
00:24:55,506 --> 00:24:57,906
That task force will land.

200
00:24:58,108 --> 00:25:00,076
You and l can't stop it.

201
00:25:00,878 --> 00:25:05,042
Pearl Harbor was a disaster,
like the Spanish Armada.

202
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,374
Listen, son...

203
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:10,883
...you and l are professionals.

204
00:25:11,088 --> 00:25:15,616
lf the manager says, ''Sacrifice,''
we lay down a bunt...

205
00:25:15,826 --> 00:25:18,818
...and let somebody else
hit the home runs.

206
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:21,193
We know about those destroyers...

207
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:24,265
...out of commission,
tied up around San Diego.

208
00:25:24,902 --> 00:25:26,836
We could use them here...

209
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:28,670
...but they're not around.

210
00:25:29,406 --> 00:25:30,873
They won't be.

211
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:35,242
Our job is to lay down
that sacrifice.

212
00:25:36,046 --> 00:25:38,571
That's what we were trained for.

213
00:25:38,782 --> 00:25:40,409
That's what we'll do.

214
00:25:41,752 --> 00:25:43,242
Understand?

215
00:25:58,135 --> 00:25:59,568
Thank you.

216
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,630
All set, sir.

217
00:26:07,377 --> 00:26:08,901
Secure your boats.

218
00:26:09,113 --> 00:26:10,842
Secure the boats?

219
00:26:11,048 --> 00:26:14,279
Shorty, take the admiral
and his staff to Corregidor.

220
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,419
Lefty, you stand by to run
a messenger trip daily at 900.

221
00:26:19,723 --> 00:26:22,851
The rest of you
take your boats to Sisiman Cove.

222
00:26:23,527 --> 00:26:25,324
You join us there.

223
00:26:37,407 --> 00:26:39,637
Are you kidding, Brick?

224
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,701
Theirs not to reason why,
theirs but to do--

225
00:26:42,913 --> 00:26:44,107
And die.

226
00:26:44,314 --> 00:26:47,442
l don't want to be bored
to death running messages.

227
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:51,350
l'll see that you get
the more intriguing ones.

228
00:26:54,158 --> 00:26:55,716
Does that help?

229
00:28:24,948 --> 00:28:26,040
Any chow, Brick?

230
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:29,745
-Razor blades and toothpaste.
-That's a swell diet.

231
00:28:29,953 --> 00:28:33,719
-What's the dope, Skipper?
-Jap transports landed up north.

232
00:28:33,924 --> 00:28:36,358
They're giving Bataan the works.

233
00:28:41,765 --> 00:28:44,495
-Good morning, sir. Any dope?
-No dope.

234
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:46,759
Good morning, sir.

235
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,198
A message just came in.

236
00:28:48,405 --> 00:28:52,068
And Admiral Blackwell wishes
to see you immediately. Very urgent.

237
00:28:52,276 --> 00:28:53,573
Thank you.

238
00:28:55,846 --> 00:28:59,247
Probably wants us to carry
a message to Garcia.

239
00:29:00,817 --> 00:29:03,285
Cross, stand by with that 4 1 boat.

240
00:29:03,487 --> 00:29:05,785
Let's use those razor blades.

241
00:29:07,557 --> 00:29:11,015
Chief, l want you to keep
sanitary precautions at all times.

242
00:29:11,228 --> 00:29:14,891
Dig a big hole over there to put
the garbage in and what-have-you.

243
00:29:15,098 --> 00:29:17,532
lk eep these pots and pans scrubbed.

244
00:29:17,734 --> 00:29:20,294
Don't put anything in the bay,
whatever you do.

245
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,770
Holy smokes, cook!
You call that soup?

246
00:29:26,209 --> 00:29:27,870
No, sir, that's dishwater.

247
00:29:38,288 --> 00:29:39,721
Ensigns.

248
00:29:44,127 --> 00:29:45,924
l suppose you're getting tired...

249
00:29:46,129 --> 00:29:49,189
...of all this routine messenger
and patrol duty.

250
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:54,803
l know you're anxious to prove
your theory of the motor torpedo boat.

251
00:29:58,008 --> 00:29:59,805
As you know...

252
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,308
...the Japs have Subic Bay.

253
00:30:03,313 --> 00:30:07,613
They've got a cruiser at Fort Balanga
shelling our positions on Bataan.

254
00:30:07,884 --> 00:30:09,909
We've either got to sink her...

255
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,247
...or pull out our troops.

256
00:30:12,456 --> 00:30:16,916
Corregidor, Sisiman Cove, Subic.

257
00:30:17,127 --> 00:30:19,027
The lines are here.

258
00:30:19,229 --> 00:30:21,493
The Jap minefields here.

259
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:23,632
Their cruiser...

260
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:24,994
...there.

261
00:30:27,671 --> 00:30:29,104
Sink her.

262
00:30:29,606 --> 00:30:31,665
Excuse me, sir,
may l borrow that?

263
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,810
l think one boat,
don't you, Mr. Ryan?

264
00:30:43,253 --> 00:30:46,313
No, l think two boats, Mr. Brickley.

265
00:30:48,592 --> 00:30:50,059
Two boats, sir.

266
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,887
Shove off at dusk.

267
00:30:53,296 --> 00:30:55,025
Good evening, gentlemen.

268
00:31:01,238 --> 00:31:04,332
We haven't got enough
steel helmets to go around...

269
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:07,271
...so issue them to your gunners
and torpedo men.

270
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:19,154
l repeat again...

271
00:31:19,356 --> 00:31:23,918
...do not open up on your radios
until you're sure they've spotted you.

272
00:31:24,628 --> 00:31:27,461
Use your 50-calibers
to knock out the searchlights.

273
00:31:27,664 --> 00:31:29,996
You said there'd be two boats.
Who's the second?

274
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,498
Rusty with the 34 boat.

275
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:36,527
That's all.
We'll shove off about 1 800.

276
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,139
l'll regulate the speed...

277
00:31:38,341 --> 00:31:41,674
...so we'll reach the end
of this leg here in darkness.

278
00:31:41,878 --> 00:31:43,402
All right, Andy.

279
00:31:45,882 --> 00:31:48,146
All right, let's go, Mahan.

280
00:31:53,623 --> 00:31:54,783
Sir.

281
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:56,719
Nothing.

282
00:31:56,927 --> 00:31:59,862
-Sir?
-Not a chance, Shorty.

283
00:32:01,164 --> 00:32:04,725
Copy that in longhand
and give it to Andy on the 34 boat.

284
00:32:06,336 --> 00:32:07,928
Eager beavers.

285
00:32:09,306 --> 00:32:12,002
What's the matter with us?
We have the best boat.

286
00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:14,541
And my boat's the fastest one
in the water.

287
00:32:15,579 --> 00:32:17,137
Seventeen-thirty.

288
00:32:17,347 --> 00:32:20,407
Doc, will you take a look
at this finger?

289
00:32:25,422 --> 00:32:26,480
Fellas...

290
00:32:28,058 --> 00:32:30,492
...we finally got the green light...

291
00:32:30,694 --> 00:32:33,060
...to sink a Jap cruiser
in Subic Bay.

292
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:36,494
Through those Jap mines, artillery
and past them patrol boats.

293
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:39,726
One of our boats ought to get back.

294
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:43,064
Any of you guys not on time
don't get to go.

295
00:32:43,573 --> 00:32:45,598
All right, Shakespeare.

296
00:32:55,819 --> 00:32:59,311
You got blood poison to the elbow.
You belong in the hospital.

297
00:32:59,523 --> 00:33:00,785
When l get back.

298
00:33:00,991 --> 00:33:05,291
-lf you don't want to lose it, go now.
-Put iodine on it and wrap it up.

299
00:33:06,897 --> 00:33:11,357
Look, Doc, do me a favor.
lk eep your mouth shut about it.

300
00:33:13,503 --> 00:33:16,597
Don't forget to put a pinch of salt
in that pancake batter.

301
00:33:16,806 --> 00:33:19,104
You'll find jam under my bunk.
Give them that.

302
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,572
All set, Rusty.

303
00:33:27,817 --> 00:33:30,547
-Your arm all right?
-Sure.

304
00:33:32,489 --> 00:33:33,615
Everything's ready.

305
00:33:33,823 --> 00:33:37,315
Okay, Slug, relax until time
to shove off.

306
00:33:38,461 --> 00:33:39,792
Hey, Rusty!

307
00:33:42,732 --> 00:33:44,359
Let me see that arm.

308
00:33:53,043 --> 00:33:54,943
You're going to sick bay, fella.

309
00:33:55,145 --> 00:33:58,672
You aren't afraid of a little
competition, are you, Brick?

310
00:33:59,316 --> 00:34:03,116
Shorty, the 31 boat'll go
instead of the 34. Get her ready.

311
00:34:05,455 --> 00:34:08,754
l won't lose a good exec
because you're out of your head.

312
00:34:15,999 --> 00:34:17,967
Secure the boat.

313
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:22,871
Mulcahey!

314
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,341
For two bits, l'd punch you
right in the mush.

315
00:34:29,112 --> 00:34:31,342
-You know the score.
-Right.

316
00:34:32,616 --> 00:34:35,881
And have your torpedo man stand by
in case those circuits fail.

317
00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:39,613
Wind them up.

318
00:34:42,892 --> 00:34:44,086
Come on.

319
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,495
Let's go, Good Luck.

320
00:35:49,826 --> 00:35:52,852
Corpsman! Corpsman!

321
00:35:53,063 --> 00:35:55,827
This is a hospital.
Why don't you hire a hall?

322
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,958
Take off your hat.

323
00:36:09,946 --> 00:36:12,915
lt's just a little cut
along the finger. l don't--

324
00:36:44,347 --> 00:36:46,042
Shirts are hard to get out here.

325
00:36:46,249 --> 00:36:48,183
So are artificial arms.

326
00:36:53,623 --> 00:36:55,318
Anchors aweigh.

327
00:37:08,171 --> 00:37:11,197
You've got a temperature
a little over 1 03.

328
00:37:11,975 --> 00:37:13,772
Chew these sulfur pills.

329
00:37:15,945 --> 00:37:17,742
What is this, shrapnel?

330
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:22,311
Where did you get it?

331
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:23,747
Cavite.

332
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,047
lt doesn't hurt.

333
00:37:26,489 --> 00:37:28,047
lt doesn't hurt?

334
00:37:29,058 --> 00:37:31,322
Did you ever hear
of blood poisoning?

335
00:37:32,495 --> 00:37:36,261
lf you'd been a few hours later,
l'd have had to take that arm off.

336
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:40,564
Headquarters called.
Casualties arriving in two hours.

337
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,635
-How many?
-Over 200.

338
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:45,307
Double deckers.
Try and get some rest.

339
00:37:47,343 --> 00:37:49,811
We've got work to do.
That young man is sick.

340
00:37:50,013 --> 00:37:52,538
Get his temperature down
and get him to sleep.

341
00:37:52,749 --> 00:37:54,614
Take a few minutes yourself.

342
00:37:58,588 --> 00:38:01,250
You'd better lie down.
You have a temperature of 1 03.

343
00:38:01,457 --> 00:38:02,287
So l've heard.

344
00:38:02,492 --> 00:38:05,154
You Navy boys always run about
two degrees above normal.

345
00:38:05,361 --> 00:38:06,851
Must be the time spent at sea.

346
00:38:07,597 --> 00:38:08,757
What is your rank?

347
00:38:09,632 --> 00:38:10,758
Second lieutenant.

348
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:13,162
l'm a j.g., so watch your language.

349
00:38:15,505 --> 00:38:18,372
l thought you were a motorcycle cop.

350
00:38:18,975 --> 00:38:21,443
Despite your gold braid,
you don't tell us.

351
00:38:21,644 --> 00:38:23,077
We tell you. So lie down.

352
00:38:29,786 --> 00:38:30,980
Unfasten your pants.

353
00:38:31,721 --> 00:38:34,121
-What?
-Unfasten your pants.

354
00:38:34,991 --> 00:38:37,050
Unfasten your pants.

355
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:05,977
Come right a little.

356
00:39:06,422 --> 00:39:07,889
Right a little!

357
00:39:08,591 --> 00:39:11,219
This should be the
minefields now, sir.

358
00:39:15,398 --> 00:39:16,888
Left a little.

359
00:39:17,533 --> 00:39:19,023
Left easy.

360
00:39:20,203 --> 00:39:21,693
Steady as she goes.

361
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:26,504
-Any sign of Long's boat?
-Don't see him, sir.

362
00:39:49,532 --> 00:39:52,092
-What's wrong?
-This gas was loaded with wax.

363
00:39:52,302 --> 00:39:53,166
Sabotage.

364
00:39:53,369 --> 00:39:55,667
-How long to get started?
-About 40 minutes.

365
00:39:55,872 --> 00:39:57,464
Hurry it all you can.

366
00:39:59,943 --> 00:40:01,069
Forty-minute job.

367
00:40:01,277 --> 00:40:02,801
They're trying to pick us up.

368
00:40:04,747 --> 00:40:06,237
Get that light!

369
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:28,259
Abandon ship!

370
00:40:28,538 --> 00:40:30,631
Abandon ship!

371
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:51,726
The shore batteries got
the 31 boat, sir.

372
00:40:51,928 --> 00:40:54,658
Stand by your torpedo tubes.

373
00:41:40,476 --> 00:41:41,966
Stand by!

374
00:41:45,181 --> 00:41:46,205
Fire one!

375
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:51,377
Fire two!

376
00:43:58,247 --> 00:44:00,807
-Well, Cookie, we did it.
-Did what?

377
00:44:01,017 --> 00:44:01,915
Been someplace?

378
00:44:02,118 --> 00:44:04,143
We blew that Jap cruiser
into next month.

379
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,746
Recently?

380
00:44:05,955 --> 00:44:06,922
Pick up any chow?

381
00:44:07,123 --> 00:44:10,320
l forgot to tell you, Mick,
your laundry's drying. Came out swell.

382
00:44:10,526 --> 00:44:12,721
You guys were late for breakfast too.
lt was wonderful.

383
00:44:12,929 --> 00:44:15,124
Yeah, cupcakes with raisins.

384
00:44:16,098 --> 00:44:17,429
Listen, bigmouth.

385
00:44:17,633 --> 00:44:20,193
That ship was a big, converted
job with eight-inch guns...

386
00:44:20,403 --> 00:44:22,928
...and we blew her
into kingdom come.

387
00:44:38,821 --> 00:44:40,220
Tompkins.

388
00:44:41,023 --> 00:44:43,150
-How?
-Machine gun in the belly.

389
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,884
Yes, and we lost the 31 boat too.

390
00:45:05,948 --> 00:45:09,907
Our club on Bataan took another
rap on the chin last night.

391
00:45:10,353 --> 00:45:12,321
Where is that Navy of yours, anyway?

392
00:45:12,521 --> 00:45:14,352
On Central Park Lake?

393
00:45:14,757 --> 00:45:16,224
They'll be along.

394
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:18,586
We won't see them till Christmas.

395
00:45:19,362 --> 00:45:22,627
By then the Air Force will have
won the war, l suppose.

396
00:45:22,832 --> 00:45:24,356
Only, where is the Air Force?

397
00:45:39,582 --> 00:45:41,209
Enemy aircraft approaching.

398
00:45:41,417 --> 00:45:43,908
Secure all ventilators and bulkheads.

399
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,021
Repeat: Enemy aircraft approaching.

400
00:45:47,223 --> 00:45:48,713
Secure all...

401
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:51,093
...ventilators and bulkheads.

402
00:47:21,384 --> 00:47:24,080
That's a nice kind of a girl
to have around...

403
00:47:24,286 --> 00:47:25,753
...in wartime.

404
00:47:25,955 --> 00:47:27,445
Or anytime.

405
00:47:29,024 --> 00:47:29,888
She's...

406
00:47:30,092 --> 00:47:31,855
...kind of cute too.

407
00:47:32,294 --> 00:47:35,263
1 1 ,000 guys can't be wrong.

408
00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:43,398
Pretty tough, huh?

409
00:47:43,606 --> 00:47:45,369
Why don't you girls
get some rest?

410
00:47:45,608 --> 00:47:46,973
Don't think we won't.

411
00:47:47,176 --> 00:47:48,040
How about it?

412
00:47:48,244 --> 00:47:50,712
Going to ask tall, dark
and obnoxious?

413
00:47:57,153 --> 00:47:59,451
Got to look pretty
for that dance tonight.

414
00:48:00,856 --> 00:48:02,255
How's the arm?

415
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:03,720
Okay.

416
00:48:03,926 --> 00:48:06,087
Good. Would you like to
go to a dance?

417
00:48:06,495 --> 00:48:09,055
Listen, sister, l don't dance.

418
00:48:09,265 --> 00:48:11,733
And l can't take
time out now to learn.

419
00:48:12,034 --> 00:48:14,366
All l want to do
is get out of here.

420
00:48:24,613 --> 00:48:27,605
Now, wait a minute
before you start popping off.

421
00:48:27,917 --> 00:48:30,477
l don't care if they
dance their dogs off.

422
00:48:31,554 --> 00:48:34,990
Be reasonable.
Those girls need relaxation.

423
00:48:35,191 --> 00:48:37,159
Something to remind them they're...

424
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:38,189
...women!

425
00:48:38,394 --> 00:48:39,326
Sure.

426
00:48:39,528 --> 00:48:41,962
They're not going to
remind me of anything.

427
00:48:42,164 --> 00:48:43,859
All uglied up in those...

428
00:48:44,066 --> 00:48:45,897
...potato bags.

429
00:49:58,807 --> 00:50:00,331
-Hello.
-Hello.

430
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:02,068
Nice party.

431
00:50:02,945 --> 00:50:06,005
Now that you're here,
why don't you stay a while?

432
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:08,376
Oh, no, l just came over to...

433
00:50:08,584 --> 00:50:09,881
...thank you for...

434
00:50:10,085 --> 00:50:13,054
...you know, sewing up my shirt.

435
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:15,757
But you do dance, don't you?

436
00:50:28,837 --> 00:50:30,862
Good evening, Mr. Ryan.

437
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:33,265
Hello.

438
00:51:12,481 --> 00:51:14,813
Think you better put
that arm back in the sling?

439
00:51:15,017 --> 00:51:17,144
You might use it someday...

440
00:51:17,453 --> 00:51:20,251
...for plowing, or
cutting out paper dolls.

441
00:51:21,523 --> 00:51:23,491
Why the eager interest?

442
00:51:23,859 --> 00:51:25,451
Professional?

443
00:51:37,406 --> 00:51:39,704
lt's rather like back home,
isn't it?

444
00:51:40,275 --> 00:51:41,708
The porch...

445
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,400
...hammock...

446
00:51:44,113 --> 00:51:45,978
...fireflies.

447
00:51:46,515 --> 00:51:47,812
Where?

448
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:49,574
lowa.

449
00:51:50,919 --> 00:51:52,944
You know, tall corn.

450
00:51:55,524 --> 00:51:56,388
Where?

451
00:51:56,592 --> 00:51:58,389
Upper New York State.

452
00:51:58,594 --> 00:51:59,686
You know...

453
00:51:59,895 --> 00:52:01,260
...apples.

454
00:52:18,714 --> 00:52:19,806
Those gun flashes...

455
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:22,074
...look like fireflies.

456
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,683
Every night...

457
00:52:27,389 --> 00:52:29,414
...they come a little closer.

458
00:53:07,296 --> 00:53:08,456
Hi, Rusty.

459
00:53:08,664 --> 00:53:10,256
Sandy, this is Lt. Brickley.

460
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:12,224
-Miss Davyss.
-How do you do?

461
00:53:13,068 --> 00:53:14,194
Hello.

462
00:53:15,104 --> 00:53:16,093
Nice party?

463
00:53:17,072 --> 00:53:18,699
Swell!

464
00:53:20,075 --> 00:53:21,235
That big lug dance?

465
00:53:21,443 --> 00:53:23,104
Wonderful.

466
00:53:23,312 --> 00:53:25,678
Only stepped on her foot once.

467
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:27,442
What's up?

468
00:53:28,217 --> 00:53:29,548
lt can wait.

469
00:53:32,821 --> 00:53:33,753
Go ahead.

470
00:54:00,749 --> 00:54:03,047
Andy did a pretty good job
on the cruiser.

471
00:54:03,252 --> 00:54:05,049
All we've got left
is Gardner.

472
00:54:05,254 --> 00:54:07,188
He's such a young kid for--

473
00:54:07,389 --> 00:54:09,186
lt's tricky duty.

474
00:54:14,963 --> 00:54:16,362
Why not?

475
00:54:16,732 --> 00:54:17,824
Okay.

476
00:54:22,237 --> 00:54:23,761
Just how bad is that hand?

477
00:54:23,972 --> 00:54:27,703
The finger is open to the bone.
And there's still infection there.

478
00:54:28,243 --> 00:54:29,904
Let's go talk to the doctor.

479
00:54:30,112 --> 00:54:31,170
ls it healing?

480
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:32,369
Yes.

481
00:54:32,581 --> 00:54:35,106
Come on, Brick.
Help me pour the heat on.

482
00:55:45,921 --> 00:55:46,819
How'd it go?

483
00:55:47,022 --> 00:55:48,319
Did you lose anyone?

484
00:55:49,091 --> 00:55:49,921
No, sir.

485
00:55:50,726 --> 00:55:52,853
Mr. Ryan picked us up beautifully.

486
00:55:53,929 --> 00:55:55,123
l'm sorry, sir.

487
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:57,491
l'd rather lose my right arm
than the 33 boat.

488
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,033
Couldn't be helped.

489
00:56:01,003 --> 00:56:02,368
Paid off.

490
00:56:03,472 --> 00:56:04,700
Yes, sir.

491
00:56:05,207 --> 00:56:06,401
Thanks.

492
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:12,471
Andy got a 7.7
through both ankles.

493
00:56:15,717 --> 00:56:17,048
Snake.

494
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,581
Take Andy's place on the 34 boat.

495
00:56:22,057 --> 00:56:23,183
Aye, aye, sir.

496
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:39,739
That's tough luck, Andy.

497
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:41,034
How're they feeling now?

498
00:56:42,577 --> 00:56:44,010
They don't.

499
00:56:44,546 --> 00:56:46,707
You give us the word
if you need anything.

500
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:48,814
Sure.

501
00:56:49,017 --> 00:56:50,450
We'll be over to see you.

502
00:56:50,652 --> 00:56:52,779
The job's yours again
when you can take it.

503
00:56:53,956 --> 00:56:55,685
l'll give you the nudge...

504
00:56:55,891 --> 00:56:57,654
...about next week.

505
00:57:00,495 --> 00:57:01,757
Wind them up.

506
00:57:23,251 --> 00:57:25,719
You never saw nothing like it.
We blew that Nip out of the water!

507
00:57:25,921 --> 00:57:28,151
-Two fish, right in the guts.
-Get this, Mick.

508
00:57:28,357 --> 00:57:29,881
We started to run like this--

509
00:57:30,092 --> 00:57:31,855
We had cupcakes for breakfast!

510
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,687
With raisins.

511
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:05,121
-Glad to see you aboard, Miss Davyss.
-Thank you. Good evening.

512
00:58:05,327 --> 00:58:07,693
Gentlemen, l would
like to present...

513
00:58:07,896 --> 00:58:10,922
...Mr. Ryan's guest, Miss Davyss.

514
00:58:12,367 --> 00:58:13,664
This is a--

515
00:58:13,969 --> 00:58:16,028
Wait just a minute.

516
00:58:47,736 --> 00:58:48,930
Mr. Long.

517
00:58:49,137 --> 00:58:51,401
-lt's a pleasure to have you here.
-Thank you.

518
00:58:51,606 --> 00:58:53,039
-Mr. Aiken.
-How do you do?

519
00:58:53,241 --> 00:58:54,538
How do you do?

520
00:58:54,743 --> 00:58:56,176
Mr. Gardner.

521
00:58:56,511 --> 00:58:58,069
-Nice having you here.
-Thank you.

522
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,147
-And Mr. Cross.
-Very happy to know you.

523
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,454
Dinner is served, sir.

524
00:59:13,662 --> 00:59:14,856
Thank you.

525
00:59:15,931 --> 00:59:18,399
Will you take my place
at the head of the table?

526
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:41,851
Miss Davyss took care of Rusty when he
was in the hospital at Corregidor.

527
00:59:42,057 --> 00:59:45,823
She's now attached to the
field hospital at Bataan peninsula.

528
00:59:46,027 --> 00:59:48,154
There are nurses
over here on Bataan?

529
00:59:48,363 --> 00:59:49,557
A few.

530
00:59:50,232 --> 00:59:53,326
Wasn't it mean enough
for you in Corregidor...

531
00:59:53,535 --> 00:59:55,901
...without sending you girls over here?

532
00:59:56,104 --> 00:59:57,935
Well, l asked for it.

533
00:59:58,373 --> 01:00:01,467
Over here, l can talk to Rusty
sometimes on the phone.

534
01:00:03,812 --> 01:00:05,439
By George, we're neighbors now!

535
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:08,582
Next time, bring the other girls.
We'll have a dance!

536
01:00:08,783 --> 01:00:10,182
Be a good idea!

537
01:00:14,856 --> 01:00:16,653
This is a lovely party.

538
01:00:16,858 --> 01:00:18,189
lt's swell.

539
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:19,918
Thanks.

540
01:00:22,464 --> 01:00:24,329
-Benny.
-Yes, sir.

541
01:00:31,907 --> 01:00:32,999
Thank you.

542
01:00:34,376 --> 01:00:35,365
Soup.

543
01:00:48,456 --> 01:00:49,286
Hot.

544
01:00:49,824 --> 01:00:51,689
Biscuits, very good.

545
01:00:51,893 --> 01:00:52,951
Thank you.

546
01:00:56,598 --> 01:00:58,463
Real jam, sir.

547
01:00:59,834 --> 01:01:02,132
Soup, biscuits, jam.

548
01:01:02,337 --> 01:01:04,305
l still say it's a swell party.

549
01:01:04,506 --> 01:01:07,600
Now all we need is
an orchestra and a floor show.

550
01:01:08,109 --> 01:01:11,670
Miss Davyss, you're in for
the biggest surprise of your life.

551
01:01:14,149 --> 01:01:17,175
Dear old girl

552
01:01:19,654 --> 01:01:21,281
The robin...

553
01:01:22,457 --> 01:01:24,357
...sings above you

554
01:01:30,098 --> 01:01:32,191
Dear old girl

555
01:01:34,769 --> 01:01:37,738
It speaks of how I love you

556
01:01:46,615 --> 01:01:49,311
The blinding tears are falling

557
01:01:59,794 --> 01:02:02,729
As I think of my lost pearl

558
01:02:09,738 --> 01:02:12,468
And my broken heart is calling

559
01:02:19,981 --> 01:02:22,142
Calling for you

560
01:02:27,489 --> 01:02:30,151
Dear old girl

561
01:02:41,269 --> 01:02:43,169
Terrific! Wonderful!

562
01:02:47,942 --> 01:02:50,433
lf you'll excuse me,
l have a lot of checking to do.

563
01:02:50,645 --> 01:02:51,634
Surely.

564
01:03:01,056 --> 01:03:03,456
Thank you very much for coming over.

565
01:03:04,592 --> 01:03:06,958
lt meant a great deal to all of us.

566
01:03:08,029 --> 01:03:08,961
Good night, Sandy.

567
01:03:09,164 --> 01:03:10,358
Good night.

568
01:03:10,565 --> 01:03:12,624
-Me too. Could l call you Sandy?
-Sure.

569
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:14,301
-Well, good night.
-Good night.

570
01:03:14,502 --> 01:03:15,491
Thanks.

571
01:03:16,771 --> 01:03:18,932
-Good night, Sandy.
-Good night.

572
01:03:25,347 --> 01:03:28,714
l don't know when l've
had such a nice time.

573
01:03:28,917 --> 01:03:32,375
And don't forget now,
we're neighbors and everything.

574
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:34,280
Good night, Rusty.

575
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:49,659
How's the chow?

576
01:03:49,904 --> 01:03:50,893
Great!

577
01:03:51,172 --> 01:03:53,572
Boy, if l had you
on the old Arizona...

578
01:03:53,775 --> 01:03:56,676
...l'd make a pot roast
that'd make your hair curl.

579
01:04:46,227 --> 01:04:47,216
Crying?

580
01:04:47,862 --> 01:04:49,420
l'm not crying.

581
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:55,770
lt's just that they're
such nice guys.

582
01:04:57,272 --> 01:04:58,899
You aren't kidding.

583
01:05:09,818 --> 01:05:12,412
Mr. Brickley and Mr. Ryan.

584
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,326
Confidentially...

585
01:05:27,602 --> 01:05:30,127
...the President has ordered me...

586
01:05:30,338 --> 01:05:33,273
...and certain key personnel
to Australia.

587
01:05:34,075 --> 01:05:36,441
Your boats will take us to Mindanao.

588
01:05:36,811 --> 01:05:39,575
From there, an Army bomber
will fly us south.

589
01:05:40,915 --> 01:05:43,076
You want to use
all four of the boats?

590
01:05:43,284 --> 01:05:45,411
Yes.
Get them ready.

591
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:46,780
This is secret.

592
01:05:46,988 --> 01:05:47,920
Repeat.

593
01:05:48,122 --> 01:05:49,111
Secret.

594
01:05:50,091 --> 01:05:51,558
You'll get the date when it's set.

595
01:05:52,894 --> 01:05:54,225
Aye, aye, sir.

596
01:05:54,429 --> 01:05:55,726
Just a minute.

597
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:07,073
l think you'll find all
the charts you'll need.

598
01:06:09,077 --> 01:06:11,602
You know it's not going well
with us up here.

599
01:06:11,813 --> 01:06:12,711
We get the news.

600
01:06:13,681 --> 01:06:16,741
We're scraping up all we can
to form a naval battalion.

601
01:06:17,385 --> 01:06:19,046
Can you spare any men?

602
01:06:20,755 --> 01:06:23,280
We have two extra crews, sir.

603
01:06:23,658 --> 01:06:25,489
l could use them, Brickley.

604
01:06:26,327 --> 01:06:27,487
Yes, sir.

605
01:06:32,133 --> 01:06:34,863
We're going to run south 600 miles.

606
01:06:35,069 --> 01:06:36,536
There's bad weather out there.

607
01:06:36,738 --> 01:06:38,296
lt'll be rough going.

608
01:06:38,506 --> 01:06:41,339
lf any boat breaks down,
we'll have to let her go.

609
01:06:41,543 --> 01:06:44,444
Expendable.
You know what that means.

610
01:06:45,446 --> 01:06:47,277
First night's run...

611
01:06:47,549 --> 01:06:49,016
...Cuyo lslands.

612
01:06:49,717 --> 01:06:51,344
Hole up there during the day.

613
01:06:51,553 --> 01:06:53,453
Second night's run...

614
01:06:54,022 --> 01:06:56,217
...to Cagayan on Mindanao.

615
01:06:56,424 --> 01:06:59,655
We still hold the airfield there,
but the Japs are moving fast.

616
01:06:59,861 --> 01:07:02,421
lt's a question of how long
we can hang onto it.

617
01:07:03,498 --> 01:07:06,058
Approach every landfall with caution.

618
01:07:06,901 --> 01:07:08,835
Be prepared to fight or run for it.

619
01:07:09,037 --> 01:07:12,837
But remember, your primary duty
is to get these people out.

620
01:07:14,242 --> 01:07:17,370
Rusty will take the admiral
on the 34 boat.

621
01:07:18,413 --> 01:07:19,880
And l'll take...

622
01:07:20,081 --> 01:07:22,345
...the Army personnel with me.

623
01:07:24,185 --> 01:07:26,619
We'll shove off at 2 1 00.

624
01:07:28,089 --> 01:07:29,488
Motor whaleboat ready?

625
01:07:29,691 --> 01:07:31,556
Whenever you are, sir.

626
01:07:31,793 --> 01:07:33,488
Could Mulcahey take over my duty?

627
01:07:33,695 --> 01:07:35,458
l'd like to go along and see Andy.

628
01:07:36,497 --> 01:07:39,762
Yeah, sure.
We'll shove off at 2 1 00.

629
01:07:47,709 --> 01:07:50,405
Easy does it.
Bring those boards up.

630
01:07:55,049 --> 01:07:57,745
These drums will go overboard
on the first sea we hit.

631
01:07:57,952 --> 01:07:58,782
Cross lash them.

632
01:07:58,987 --> 01:08:00,852
Put them on right and tight.

633
01:08:01,489 --> 01:08:03,821
That's exactly what
l've been telling them.

634
01:08:04,025 --> 01:08:06,391
Let's do it how the captain
and l want it done.

635
01:08:22,644 --> 01:08:24,635
We can take all we got, sir.

636
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:27,280
How's Mr. Andrews?

637
01:08:27,882 --> 01:08:31,147
Doctor says he's good for
about eight or nine days.

638
01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:34,648
Will you give him an aloha for me?

639
01:09:27,608 --> 01:09:28,768
Just for two minutes.

640
01:09:28,976 --> 01:09:32,742
Be cheerful and, you know,
give him the old one-two-three.

641
01:09:33,014 --> 01:09:34,276
Yes, ma'am.

642
01:09:43,324 --> 01:09:44,621
Hi, Brick.

643
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:46,849
Hello...

644
01:09:47,295 --> 01:09:48,284
...fellas.

645
01:09:49,764 --> 01:09:50,788
-Hi, Andy.
-Hi, fella.

646
01:09:50,998 --> 01:09:52,260
How are you feeling?

647
01:09:54,068 --> 01:09:55,296
What is this?

648
01:09:55,703 --> 01:09:58,035
A PT boat convention?

649
01:09:59,307 --> 01:10:00,331
lt's good to see you.

650
01:10:00,541 --> 01:10:01,872
You look swell, Andy.

651
01:10:02,076 --> 01:10:04,544
When will you quit stalling
and get back to work?

652
01:10:05,046 --> 01:10:06,445
Any day now.

653
01:10:06,814 --> 01:10:08,509
How's the chow in this hotel?

654
01:10:08,716 --> 01:10:09,705
Wonderful.

655
01:10:10,084 --> 01:10:11,073
Squab.

656
01:10:11,285 --> 01:10:12,274
Steak.

657
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,052
-Mulcahey and Mahan say hello.
-Cookie too.

658
01:10:15,256 --> 01:10:16,621
The whole gang.

659
01:10:16,824 --> 01:10:18,917
-How's the 34 boat?
-Fine.

660
01:10:19,127 --> 01:10:20,458
l suppose...

661
01:10:20,661 --> 01:10:22,595
...Snake's been botching up my job.

662
01:10:22,797 --> 01:10:24,788
He's no Andrews.

663
01:10:25,566 --> 01:10:28,034
Say, l got some cigarettes here.

664
01:10:28,236 --> 01:10:29,066
Go on, have some.

665
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:30,703
Thanks.

666
01:10:30,905 --> 01:10:32,770
We're keeping him in condition.

667
01:10:32,974 --> 01:10:36,171
-He's trying to take your place.
-Trying to is right.

668
01:10:41,315 --> 01:10:43,875
We got a patrol to get ready for.

669
01:10:44,619 --> 01:10:47,247
The job's yours
anytime you can make it.

670
01:10:47,455 --> 01:10:48,922
-Thanks.
-See you next week.

671
01:10:49,123 --> 01:10:50,852
-So long.
-Take it easy.

672
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:53,688
Say, Skipper--

673
01:10:57,098 --> 01:10:58,463
Sit down, Brick.

674
01:11:03,337 --> 01:11:05,965
That was a nice act you boys put on.

675
01:11:07,842 --> 01:11:09,776
How did you get the word?

676
01:11:10,411 --> 01:11:11,742
Scuttlebutt.

677
01:11:16,551 --> 01:11:18,416
Here. l'll get it for you.

678
01:11:24,792 --> 01:11:26,191
lf you get through...

679
01:11:27,094 --> 01:11:28,721
...mail these, will you?

680
01:11:29,363 --> 01:11:31,593
Sure, if there's any mail.

681
01:11:32,767 --> 01:11:34,325
One to Mother.

682
01:11:35,837 --> 01:11:37,532
One to Myra.

683
01:11:37,905 --> 01:11:39,896
You know, she's at Lockheed.

684
01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:45,010
l wrote out a will too.

685
01:11:47,582 --> 01:11:50,380
That was a pretty good act
you put on yourself.

686
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,816
Any unfinished business
that you want me...

687
01:11:56,023 --> 01:11:57,854
...to take care of for you?

688
01:11:59,927 --> 01:12:03,419
Anything particular you'd like
to have me say to your folks...

689
01:12:03,631 --> 01:12:04,791
...or to Myra?

690
01:12:09,837 --> 01:12:12,829
l guess l've written
about all l had to say.

691
01:12:15,676 --> 01:12:18,236
Sorry l couldn't do more
for the squadron.
