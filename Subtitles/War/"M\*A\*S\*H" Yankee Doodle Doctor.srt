00:00:57,148 --> 00:00:59,139
<i>[O.R. Chatter]</i>

2
00:01:03,954 --> 00:01:07,651
<i>[Woman] Doctor, do you want me</i>
<i>to hold that for you?</i>

3
00:01:07,725 --> 00:01:09,124
- Uh, Nurse.
- Doctor?

4
00:01:09,193 --> 00:01:11,024
Scratch, please.

5
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:12,858
Left infrascapula.

6
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,199
Ah! Bull's-eye.

7
00:01:15,332 --> 00:01:18,665
- Lucky shot.
- [Able] Lucky shot, nothing.
I know my anatomy.

8
00:01:18,736 --> 00:01:21,204
I wish I knew your anatomy
like you know your anatomy.

9
00:01:21,272 --> 00:01:24,207
- <i>[B.J.] Anybody? Time.</i>
- About 0100.

10
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:27,073
0100? I worked
around the clock.

11
00:01:27,144 --> 00:01:29,169
Sure beats workin' around here.

12
00:01:29,246 --> 00:01:31,407
I'm so bushed, I can't remember
my last patient.

13
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:34,042
- He had quintuplets.
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

14
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:38,214
¡<i>Silencio!</i> How can I operate with
all this flapdoodle going on?

15
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:40,382
Where there's a war,
there's a way, Frank.

16
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:42,288
Wipe.

17
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:45,692
- How many more out there?
- I counted 19 when I came in.

18
00:01:45,763 --> 00:01:48,926
Nineteen? There were 19
two hours ago.

19
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:50,967
They restock the shelves
when they run out.

20
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:53,765
I'm closing, Colonel. A couple more
minutes, and I can take over for you.

21
00:01:53,838 --> 00:01:56,773
- Why?
- <i>Why? Well, you must be dog-tired.</i>

22
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:59,139
Yes, but why me
more than anyone else?

23
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,702
Oh, because you're old...
uh, older than the rest of us, sir.

24
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,271
And you look dead...
uh, beat.

25
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:08,250
Major, I can match you incision
for incision, suture for suture...

26
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,651
clamp for clamp,
patient for patient!

27
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:12,552
But not goof for goof.

28
00:02:12,623 --> 00:02:15,786
Oh, mind your own kipper, Pierce.
Sir, I was only trying...

29
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,524
I know what you were trying to do. I was
the first man in. I'll be the last man out.

30
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,123
[Softly]
If they have to carry me out.

31
00:02:31,475 --> 00:02:33,466
[Sighs]

32
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:40,148
- Hi, Klinger.
- What you got, Igor?

33
00:02:40,217 --> 00:02:42,549
- For Radar.
- I'll give it to the fink when he gets back.

34
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,918
- Why "fink"?
- 'Cause every time the fink
gets a four-day pass...

35
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:46,889
I get stuck with the job.

36
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:49,721
I may look like a perfect secretary,
but I'd rather dig latrines.

37
00:02:49,793 --> 00:02:53,593
- Look at those nails.
- Here, for you.

38
00:02:53,664 --> 00:02:58,192
Do you know what this is? This is
the end to my brilliant military career.

39
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:03,002
- You're crazy.
- Not anymore. I got something
better than crazy.

40
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:07,339
<i>If Frank Burns makes any more</i>
<i>patroni</i>z<i>ing cracks about my age...</i>

41
00:03:07,411 --> 00:03:10,005
I'll take him behind the motor pool
and let the air out of his tires.

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,641
He didn't mean anything by it, Colonel.
He was only trying to insult you.

43
00:03:13,717 --> 00:03:16,880
- Colonel, I've got
to talk to you right away!
- Klinger, go put on a dress.

44
00:03:16,954 --> 00:03:18,945
Pardon me, sir.
Did you call me "Klinger"?

45
00:03:19,023 --> 00:03:21,992
- If you aren't Klinger,
who the Sam Hill are you?
- Sam Hill maybe.

46
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:24,220
I am Zoltan,
King of the Gypsies.

47
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:26,286
You just made my day.

48
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:30,800
Zoltan, King of the Gypsies,
you're talking yourself
into a court-martial, soldier.

49
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:33,063
You can't court-martial me.
I'm not in the army.

50
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:36,470
- <i>Not in the army?</i>
- No, sir. I'm not an American citizen.

51
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,499
- I think he's on to something.
- I wouldn't miss it for all
the chipped beef in Korea.

52
00:03:40,577 --> 00:03:44,172
Klinger, how can you be king of
the Gypsies when you're Lebanese?

53
00:03:44,248 --> 00:03:48,548
Good question. I was stolen from the
Gypsies by two ruthless Lebanese peasants...

54
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:51,019
who brought me up
as their own flesh and blood.

55
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:53,716
- I like this.
- Mmm.

56
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:56,055
Look. A signed confession
from the culprits.

57
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:58,117
It's a signed confession,
all right.

58
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:00,288
And I've been elected
king of my whole tribe.

59
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:03,925
- This is an urgent request
to return and ascend the throne.
- Sorry. I don't read Gypsy.

60
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:05,992
- Take my word for it.
- Of course.

61
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,766
- I'll be waiting in my tent
with my bags packed.
- You'll have a long wait.

62
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:11,569
Sir, my people need me.

63
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:15,339
Klinger, if I bought this story,
they'd boot me out of the army.

64
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:19,280
It's true. Now I know why the sounds
of violins set my blood on fire.

65
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,841
Why I'm so attracted
to storefront windows.

66
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,945
Why, when I smell paprika,
I face towards Budapest.

67
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:28,549
- Why I have the urge to roam.
- Zoltan, roam the hell outta here.

68
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,890
- If you'd like your tea leaves read...
- I prefer them green.

69
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:34,863
- <i>Dismissed.</i>
- ## [Singing]

70
00:04:34,932 --> 00:04:37,230
## [Screeches Off-key]

71
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:40,065
I think the king
just gave himself a hernia.

72
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:45,136
- No more rhubarb, Private?
- All gone, sir.

73
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:49,737
"All gone, sir"? I'd like to
know how come rhubarb always
disappears the minute I show up.

74
00:04:49,813 --> 00:04:53,305
- It's not just rhubarb, Frank.
People disappear.
- Stay out of this, snooping sam.

75
00:04:53,384 --> 00:04:55,750
Why do you always give me a bad time
every time I give you a bad time?

76
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:57,844
Aw, blow it out your bagpipe.

77
00:04:57,921 --> 00:05:00,185
Hello, Major. May I join you
for some pleasant conversation?

78
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:04,250
- Sure, Major. Sit down
and keep your mouth shut.
- [Chuckling]

79
00:05:04,328 --> 00:05:09,288
We got a call from Korean Army
Hospital 426. They're screaming
for supplies and surgeons.

80
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:11,561
They're up to their scalpels
in casualties. They need our help.

81
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:14,934
- For criminy sakes!
We're surgeons, not supermen.
- You can say that again.

82
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:17,530
Oh, are you comparing us to
your Colonel Penobscott again?

83
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,805
If Donald were here,
he'd be the first one to volunteer.

84
00:05:20,878 --> 00:05:23,176
That's how he became engaged.
She asked for volunteers.

85
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:25,977
- [Snickering]
- I heard that.

86
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,247
- Here's your rhubarb, sir.
- Oh, sure.

87
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,981
- I'll volunteer, sir. Just say the word.
- <i>Sorry, Major.</i>

88
00:05:32,056 --> 00:05:34,115
They didn't ask for nurses,
and I'm not offering.

89
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:37,627
I'm dispatching two surgeons
and all the supplies a jeep can carry.

90
00:05:37,694 --> 00:05:39,355
How do we pick
the two surgeons?

91
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,990
- Alphabetically is fine with me.
- <i>Oh, sure.</i>

92
00:05:42,066 --> 00:05:45,832
Captain Pierce begins with
a "P," and that puts Major Burns
with a "B" right at the top.

93
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:49,930
- Really?
- Don't blow your top, Major.
It won't be alphabetical.

94
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:54,467
- I suggest straws. Two shortest
out of three pulls the duty.
- Where do you get three?

95
00:05:54,545 --> 00:05:56,672
Burns, one, Pierce, two,
Hunnicutt, three.

96
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:59,545
- Potter, four.
- You, sir?

97
00:05:59,616 --> 00:06:03,643
- Yes, me.
- But, sir, you're a grandfather.

98
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,188
Yes, a grandfather,
but not Whistler's mother.

99
00:06:06,256 --> 00:06:08,986
Well, you're spry for your age,
Colonel. Anyone can see that.

100
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:11,857
But as commanding officer and
senior member of the surgical staff...

101
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:14,329
shouldn't you put your junior officers
on this detail?

102
00:06:14,398 --> 00:06:16,992
- How do we shut Junior up?
- Suture his lips.

103
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:20,730
<i>Burns, I may not be a colt,</i>
<i>but I'm not an old gray mare either.</i>

104
00:06:20,804 --> 00:06:23,932
- She's right.
- I'm just as fit for this detail as you are.

105
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:27,841
Maybe fitter!
We'll settle this right now.

106
00:06:27,911 --> 00:06:31,472
Frank, how would you like to be
our first kamikaze surgeon?

107
00:06:31,548 --> 00:06:35,245
- It's simple. You just do
a lobotomy on yourself.
- Stick it in the freezer.

108
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,981
May I commandeer
this deck for one minute?

109
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:41,923
- Oh, but, sir, look.
- Holy cow!

110
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,686
Sorry, son.

111
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,361
Two low cards go for a ride.

112
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:56,629
- [Frank Sighs, Clears Throat]
- Hunnicutt.

113
00:06:57,441 --> 00:07:01,343
## [B.J. Humming]

114
00:07:01,411 --> 00:07:03,845
Ten. I guess I get to wave bye-bye.

115
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:06,712
Burns.

116
00:07:06,783 --> 00:07:09,251
Five. I do better with straws.

117
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,288
Three. Looks like
a marriage, Frank.

118
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:14,916
I know I can do better,
but at my age, can I wait?

119
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:19,326
- Deuce.
- Well, that's a gyp.
That means you go and I stay.

120
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:23,264
- Oh, that's good.
- Well, Frank, looks like
you've been jilted again.

121
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,461
It's you and me, Pierce. Burns,
load the jeep with supplies...

122
00:07:26,537 --> 00:07:29,870
and don't forget my Geritol.

123
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,034
Gowns, masks,
sterile cotton, tape...

124
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,840
Tape. What did you do
with the tape?

125
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,371
Here. Just 'cause I'm a Gypsy
doesn't mean I stole it.

126
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:42,247
[Scoffs] Today you're a Gypsy.
Yesterday you were a ballerina.

127
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,753
Don't scoff, sir.
Your fate is an open book to me.

128
00:07:44,821 --> 00:07:47,016
- You're daffy.
- We read the future.

129
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,524
So can I. In about five seconds,
I'm gonna bust your nose.

130
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:51,584
Don't bite off more
than you can chew, sir.

131
00:07:51,662 --> 00:07:54,825
Believe me, the future is written
in the palm of your hand.

132
00:07:54,898 --> 00:07:58,299
Oh, yeah?
What does it say?

133
00:07:58,368 --> 00:08:01,667
- It says... [Gasps]
- What is it? What do you see?

134
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:04,707
- Let me be the first
to congratulate you, sir.
- Somebody die, leave me money?

135
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,335
- No, sir. You're gonna
cover yourself with glory.
- I am?

136
00:08:07,411 --> 00:08:10,972
- Oh, Yes. You've got a strong glory line.
- Go on.

137
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:13,414
You're about to go on a trip, sir,
a mission of mercy...

138
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:15,951
to a hospital many miles away.

139
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:18,681
I see... I see... a medal.
It's gold.

140
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:20,746
- A gold medal?
- [Blows]

141
00:08:20,824 --> 00:08:22,985
- It's turning green.
- Green?

142
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,554
It says, "For your total disregard
of danger, for operating above
and beyond the call of duty...

143
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:30,794
for insisting to go on this mission
instead of Colonel Potter."

144
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:34,200
Oh, buzz off, goofball! I know what
your little game is, and it won't work.

145
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:36,262
Sir, you're 20 years
younger than the colonel.

146
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,900
So? The old and the weak
get knocked off.

147
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,967
The young and
the strong survive.

148
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:43,035
It's the law of the jungle.

149
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:46,844
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>
- A lion should eat your face.

150
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,888
- Where does this go, sir?
- There's room up front, Your Highness.

151
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:54,355
Ah, good idea. The colonel
can use it as a footrest.

152
00:08:54,424 --> 00:08:56,824
I'll rest my foot on your butt.

153
00:08:56,893 --> 00:08:59,361
Climb in, Pierce.
Where's your gun?

154
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:01,420
Sulking under my cot.
We're not on speaking terms.

155
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:03,989
Go kiss and make up.
You're taking it with you.

156
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:07,002
Colonel, if I touch that gun,
I'll just trigger another argument.

157
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,163
Pierce, you're taking along
your sidearm.

158
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:12,470
Correct. I'm taking along my
right-side arm and my left-side arm.

159
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:15,841
You need an enemy before you
can surrender. Didn't they teach
you that in basic training?

160
00:09:15,912 --> 00:09:19,211
Pierce, I'm not riding shotgun.
Get that weapon.

00:09:19,283 --> 00:09:22,719

- Ah, yes, sahib. My feet are like wings.

This will come in handy.

- Then how about one for me?

- Sit down, Pierce.

- You're right, Margaret. I'm staying.
- Sit down, Pierce.

00:10:07,756 --> 00:10:11,453
Beware, sirs. I see snipers
and land mines and artillery.

- You see any good restaurants?
- Cut the chatter. Let's move it.

That's it. Good. What'd you sterilize
this in, egg drop soup?

We do the best we can, Captain,

00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:58,342
- [Hawkeye] Oh!
- <i>[Machine Gun Fire Continues]</i>

318
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:04,716
- Hawkeye, your gun!
- Forget that! Come on!

319
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:13,349
What are they bombing us for?
We're already bombed.

320
00:19:13,425 --> 00:19:15,416
<i>[Explosion]</i>

321
00:19:22,334 --> 00:19:24,325
They totaled our jeep.

322
00:19:26,237 --> 00:19:28,262
- The case will be in court for years.
- <i>[Gunshots]</i>

323
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,331
Get down!
You wanna be a dead duck?

324
00:19:30,408 --> 00:19:33,138
- No. I'd rather be a live chicken.
- <i>[Explosion]</i>

325
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:35,702
You wanna cut it out!

326
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,771
Oh. That was close.

327
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:40,181
I believe my life is about
to pass before my eyes.

328
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:44,153
- Let me know when it does. I love a parade.
- Even short ones?

329
00:19:44,222 --> 00:19:47,248
- Too young to die, Pierce?
- I was hoping I'd make it to Thursday.

330
00:19:47,325 --> 00:19:50,158
Well, I'm gonna give 'em
one hell of a fight...

331
00:19:50,228 --> 00:19:53,026
before they drag me off
to any Chinese prison camp.

332
00:19:53,098 --> 00:19:55,089
What's the matter,
you don't like egg foo young?

333
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,226
Miserable place for
a regular-army man to spend the war.

334
00:19:59,704 --> 00:20:01,763
Well, I don't believe
anybody's made the offer yet.

335
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,004
- <i>[Gunshots]</i>
- I think we just got an invi... invitation.

336
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,074
<i>[Explosions]</i>

337
00:20:17,655 --> 00:20:20,283
<i>[Gunfire Continues]</i>

338
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:23,156
- What are you shooting for?
- Well, that's the way this game is played.

339
00:20:23,228 --> 00:20:25,662
They shoot at us.
We shoot at them.

340
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,721
The last one to shoot wins.

341
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,735
- Here. It's your turn.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

342
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:33,794
The reason they're shooting
is that they're angry.

343
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:36,306
If I shoot back,
they'll just get angrier.

344
00:20:36,374 --> 00:20:39,673
Pierce, you got a good sense
of humor but a lousy sense of timing.

345
00:20:39,744 --> 00:20:43,271
- Fire that weapon.
- Fire it? I don't even like looking at it.

346
00:20:43,348 --> 00:20:45,373
I said, "Fire that weapon!"

347
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,715
All right. You're fired.

348
00:20:48,787 --> 00:20:53,156
- I did it as gently as I could.
- That was an order, Pierce.

349
00:20:53,224 --> 00:20:55,988
Oh, waiter. Would you take
this man's order, please?

350
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,156
- Fire the gun, Hawkeye.
- Look, Colonel.

351
00:21:00,231 --> 00:21:04,099
I'll treat their wounds, heal
their wounds, bind their wounds...

352
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:07,229
but I will not
inflict their wounds.

353
00:21:07,305 --> 00:21:10,103
- You can't just sit there.
- I may be sitting on the outside...

354
00:21:10,175 --> 00:21:12,166
but I'm running on the inside.

355
00:21:12,243 --> 00:21:15,610
- You love life that little?
- I hate guns that much.

356
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,875
<i>For God's sake, man,</i>
<i>defend yourself.</i>

357
00:21:17,949 --> 00:21:21,612
Don't think of it as a gun. Think
of it as a great little noisemaker...

358
00:21:21,686 --> 00:21:24,086
the loudest cap pistol in Korea.

359
00:21:24,155 --> 00:21:27,716
Just shoot it and scare
the living hell outta them.

360
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:30,727
[Laughing]
Well, that... that I can do.

361
00:21:30,795 --> 00:21:33,559
All right, everybody, I start
shooting at the count of three.

362
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:35,622
What's the matter?
Oh, thank you.

363
00:21:37,635 --> 00:21:39,933
Out of the way! Look out!

364
00:21:40,004 --> 00:21:41,995
Out of the way!
Behind the trees!

365
00:21:42,073 --> 00:21:44,064
Take cover! Look out!

366
00:21:44,142 --> 00:21:46,633
<i>[Gunfire]</i>

367
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:52,705
There. I used up all my bullets.
Now can I go home?

368
00:21:52,784 --> 00:21:55,150
- You're a crazier soldier than a surgeon.
- <i>[Gunfire Stops]</i>

369
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,279
Thank you.

370
00:22:03,661 --> 00:22:06,994
- You-You hear that?
- I don't hear a thing.

371
00:22:07,065 --> 00:22:09,192
That's what I mean.

372
00:22:18,276 --> 00:22:21,973
<i>Nobody's there.</i>
<i>They amscrayed.</i>

373
00:22:22,046 --> 00:22:24,037
Come here. Come here, Pierce.
Take a look.

374
00:22:36,227 --> 00:22:38,695
[Potter] Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
We're one of you.

375
00:22:38,763 --> 00:22:40,890
[Hawkeye] You're one of us.
Apple pie, Betty Grable.

376
00:22:40,965 --> 00:22:44,526
- Clara Bow.
- "Clara Bow"? Frank's right. You are old.

377
00:22:44,602 --> 00:22:47,162
- You medics?
- [Potter] Surgeons with a MASH unit.

378
00:22:47,238 --> 00:22:49,399
- What are you doing up here?
- Lookin' for broads.

379
00:22:49,474 --> 00:22:52,272
- You're not gonna find any there, Captain.
- No, no.

380
00:22:52,343 --> 00:22:54,607
He's-He's lookin' for c-casualties.

381
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:58,809
Oh, they all pulled out.
We're moving out. Let's go.

382
00:22:58,883 --> 00:23:03,286
[Chuckling] You didn't hit
a single thing, sharpshooter.

383
00:23:03,354 --> 00:23:05,345
Well, you fired
as many shots as I did...

384
00:23:05,423 --> 00:23:08,517
and you were the one who said you shot
the apple off the kaiser's head.

385
00:23:08,593 --> 00:23:13,462
Confidentially, Hawkeye, I couldn't
hit a bullet with the side of a barn.

386
00:23:13,531 --> 00:23:16,193
[Both Laughing]

387
00:23:19,304 --> 00:23:21,772
Oh. Look out for that bush.

388
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:34,942
- You all right, sir?
- Great! Why shouldn't I be?

389
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:37,112
- Well, you've been through
some terrible ordeals.
- What ordeals?

390
00:23:37,188 --> 00:23:39,213
The Korean hospital ordeal,
the bunker ordeal.

391
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,451
Piece of cake.
Enjoyed every minute.

392
00:23:41,526 --> 00:23:46,589
Well, I think I'll turn in after I do
my 50 pushups. Care to join me?

393
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:49,531
Uh, no, thank you, sir.
Good night.

394
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:51,592
Thanks for looking in, Major.

395
00:23:53,671 --> 00:23:55,901
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- Come in.

396
00:23:55,974 --> 00:23:59,466
- Finished with your tea, sir?
- It was delicious, Klinger.

397
00:23:59,544 --> 00:24:02,775
- May I read the tea leaves, sir?
- By all means.

398
00:24:02,847 --> 00:24:05,816
Says here, you're gonna
take pity on a poor Gypsy boy...

399
00:24:05,883 --> 00:24:08,613
who desperately wants
to go home to his people.

400
00:24:08,686 --> 00:24:11,246
Let's have a look.

401
00:24:11,322 --> 00:24:13,552
The way I read it,
the poor Gypsy boy...

402
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:16,150
is in danger of annoying
his commanding officer.

403
00:24:16,227 --> 00:24:19,719
And if he keeps it up, he'll get
a boot in his tambourine.

404
00:24:19,797 --> 00:24:23,062
- Got ya, sir. Good night.
- Good night, Klinger.

405
00:24:25,103 --> 00:24:27,594
[Groans Softly]

406
00:24:27,672 --> 00:24:29,663
