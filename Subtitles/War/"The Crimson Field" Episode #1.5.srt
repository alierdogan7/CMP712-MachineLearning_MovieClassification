1
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,900
Write to him.

2
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,100
How long will it take
to get to Germany?

3
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,380
I shouldn't let you do this.

4
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,690
Why are you doing this for me?

5
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,340
We are both exiles
in a strange land.

6
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,980
If we can't be human to each other
then what are we?

7
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,090
Where am I to leave the reply?

8
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,700
If one comes.

9
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,220
BUGLE CALL IN DISTANCE

10
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,420
CHATTER AND LAUGHTER IN DISTANCE

11
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,290
I want the commanding officer.

12
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,890
You are just an orderly
and therefore of no use to me.

13
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,530
With all due respect, sir,
you're making it rather difficult

14
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,050
for us to do our job. If you could
come with me to the ward...

15
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,170
And you're not the CO, unless
the Army's completely lost its mind.

16
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,420
Matron Carter.
Might I have your name?

17
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,730
Ballard. Major. J. 5th Punjab Rifles.

18
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,930
I'm not supposed to be here.
I'm not like these poor devils.

19
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,210
I need to get out and get back
to the front immediately.

20
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,730
I'll tell Colonel Brett
you want to speak to him.

21
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,490
In the meantime, I must ask
that you go quietly to the ward.

22
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,170
And I must also ask
that you give me your revolver.

23
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,850
It's not Army issue. It's mine.
Belongs to me. It's private property.

24
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,780
Nonetheless, before you go to
the ward, I still need to take it.

25
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,970
I do not enjoy being given orders
by a woman.

26
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,210
There is no point in you standing
there with your little paw out.

27
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,530
So, why don't you go
and find the CO?

28
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,370
Now, step to it.
HE SPEAKS PUNJABI

29
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,140
SHE SPEAKS PUNJABI

30
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,260
Well, well, well.

31
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,700
She speaks Punjabi.

32
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,380
The gun...is mine.

33
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,100
You'll do, Matron Carter.

34
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,100
Thank you, Nurse. Orderly,
can you take him? He can't walk.

35
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,580
Hold up.

36
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,490
He's still himself.
What, you know him?

37
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,500
Yeah. Me and him got business.

38
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,770
An Indian Army officer,
Ballard, wants to see you.

39
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,490
Him and several hundred others.
I'll put him on my list.

40
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,890
I'd like it if you could see him
quite promptly.

41
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,850
He's the type
to make his presence felt.

42
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,290
He'll go on my list.

43
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,500
Have you been running? I never run.

44
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,220
DOOR OPENS

45
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,450
That officer, Ballard.
You give him a message for us?

46
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,930
Depends on the message.

47
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,970
Just tell him
Gorman the sniper's here.

48
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,730
Tell him I said hello.

49
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,300
Is he going to want to say hello
to you? I reckon.

50
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,330
So, will you tell him?

51
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,410
Most important you get yourself
sorted out and have a kip first.

52
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,100
I'm nowhere near that yet.

53
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,570
Tomorrow, we'll have been here
for three months. I know.

54
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,930
Don't you think
we should throw a do?

55
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,290
I mean, we don't need a reason,
but it's the perfect reason.

56
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,210
We can invite the patients
and the staff. What kind of do?

57
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,610
You know,
just something little and fun.

58
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,130
Charades, songs round a piano.

59
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,330
Everybody loves a singsong.

60
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,410
People can do their party pieces.

61
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,250
Bet you have a party piece,
don't you, Corporal?

62
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,970
Yeah. Mopping.

63
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,210
Well, I'll organise it.
It will just be small.

64
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,970
But you can tell people,
and whoever wants to come can come.

65
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,210
I'm not singing. No, nor me.

66
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,210
Oh, for heaven's sake!
I'll start the singing.

67
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,210
We want them to get better,
not worse.

68
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,730
I'll have you know that at home,

69
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,660
I'm actually considered
rather tuneful.

70
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,730
What just happened?

71
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,410
I think we're throwing a do.

72
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,730
I'll pick some flowers
to decorate it,

73
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,850
and maybe even put up a stage.

74
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,250
And, of course,
there'll be a pianist, but not me.

75
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,130
I'm not very good at the piano,
but someone who IS good at the piano.

76
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,970
Have you put on concerts before?

77
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,170
Oh, yes, I have a great deal
of experience in theatricals.

78
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,690
I was in
the Worthing Operatic Society

79
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,490
where I took the role of a pirate
in Pirates Of Penzance.

80
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,690
Everyone commented on it...
very favourably.

81
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,290
I just thought it would be fun.

82
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,940
Give everyone a boost
and bring us all together.

83
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,900
Yes. Well, carry on, Marshall.
I shall watch and applaud.

84
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,570
Morning, Major Ballard.
Time to have your dressing changed.

85
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,890
No.

86
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,570
Why not, Major? Because I said not.

87
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,250
Where's the commanding officer?
Has he fallen down a hole?

88
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,210
What have I got to do
to speak to him?

89
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,330
He'll be round
as soon as he's ready.

90
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,170
Why doesn't anybody in this place
do what they're told?!

91
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,220
If I could just dress your arm...

92
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,060
Colonel Brett.

93
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,250
Delighted you could finally make it.
I did warn you.

94
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,490
I don't appreciate being summoned
by the sound of smashing crockery.

95
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,770
You have to sign me out
and send me back up to the front

96
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,570
as a matter of urgency.
Do I, indeed?

97
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,130
I've left 400 sepoys under
the command of a young lieutenant

98
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,610
two months out of school,
who has perfect Greek and Latin,

99
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,650
but not a word of the bloody lingo
spoken by my Sikh Lions.

100
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,700
Matron here speaks more Punjabi
than he does.

101
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,210
You have an open wound in your arm.
You're staying here.

102
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,810
Colonel...

103
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,250
This is confidential.
There's going to be a push.

104
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,450
How in hell are my men
supposed to execute that push

105
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,620
if there's no-one there
who can understand them?

106
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,730
There's nothing leaving
until dawn tomorrow.

107
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,370
But you won't be going anywhere

108
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,610
unless you pipe down
and get treated.

109
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,570
Well, in that case.
I want Matron to do it.

110
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,450
Matron has far too much work
to be dancing attendance on you.

111
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,820
Well, shall we ask her.

112
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,140
If it will mean less trouble.

113
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,570
You never said!
You never asked, sir.

114
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,370
I don't know why
you're so surprised.

115
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,250
You know I began my service
in India.

116
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,250
Yes, but I didn't know you grew up
there. I'm quite envious. Why?

117
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,170
Well...tigers and elephants.

118
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,850
We didn't have them in Godalming.

119
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,210
It was a perfectly ordinary
childhood.

120
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,050
You're a dark horse, Grace Carter.
I'm nothing of the sort.

121
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,450
Oh, Sister, when this chap of yours
gets some leave, you must tell us.

122
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,730
We can arrange something
so you can scoot off and join him.

123
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,450
Oh, sorry, of course.

124
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,850
I don't want you to think
that we're gossiping about you.

125
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,250
No, no, not at all.
It's very kind of you, sir.

126
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,940
It's bribery. We want to keep you.

127
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,650
I need you to cover night duty
tonight. Tonight, Matron?

128
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,010
Is that a problem?

129
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,460
No, of course not.

130
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,250
So, what sort of do
is this going to be?

131
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,650
Depravity and absinthe?
Will I plumb new depths of shame?

132
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,610
More tea and biscuits,
songs and charades, I'm afraid.

133
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,460
Hardly the last days of Rome.

134
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,900
They're ready for us in theatre.
Yep. Two minutes.

135
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,210
Are you musical, Captain?

136
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,540
No.

137
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,180
Two minutes.

138
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,290
Don't mind my friend.

139
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,450
One of the best, but the word
"abrupt" was coined for him.

140
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,290
I don't mind him.
We could do a duet.

141
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,490
A lush, swooning, romantic duet.
Gazing into each other's eyes.

142
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,930
Followed by a quick engagement,

143
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,970
become the most talked about people
in the place

144
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,290
and knock Sister Livesey here
right off her pedestal.

145
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,970
For God's sake. Can't everyone
find another subject to discuss?

146
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,010
Has everyone got
such boring little lives

147
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,100
that the only thing
they can talk about is me?!

148
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,620
God, is that the time?

149
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,220
DOOR CLOSES

150
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,300
You're shaking. What's wrong?

151
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,130
Joan, what is it?

152
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,930
Can't you leave me alone?

153
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,180
I just want everyone
to leave me alone.

154
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,540
Is that too much to ask?

155
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,060
BANGING ON DOOR

156
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,570
It all rather blossomed
into something more extravagant,

157
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,730
which means we've got far more
to be getting on with.

158
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,730
This is for you to do, and you.
Flora, I'm on the wards.

159
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,570
I don't have time to argue
about this. I'm far too busy!

160
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,010
I've got to organise
the acts and turns.

161
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,620
I thought we could sing something...
together.

162
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,410
What do you mean, together?
On a stage?

163
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,980
I'm not singing.

164
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,900
Ah, Matron.

165
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,530
I hope you can forgive me

166
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,340
for taking you away
from all those other vital duties.

167
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,650
Major, you don't care
if I forgive you or not.

168
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,690
You just want to be
the centre of attention

169
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,610
and have everything your own way.

170
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,330
What else would I expect
of a man from the regiment

171
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,580
who call themselves The Fire-Eaters.

172
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,740
How would you know
the nickname of our regiment?

173
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,330
I expect someone told me.
I expect they didn't.

174
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,620
That name hasn't been used
for 20 years. How would you know it?

175
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,130
You know, I had flattered myself
you might be interested in me,

176
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,980
but now I think you're interested
in the company of men that I keep.

177
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,860
Is there a question
you want to ask me?

178
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,780
Someone you want to know about?

179
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,370
I have no question for you, sir.

180
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,730
No.

181
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,340
Now you're lying.

182
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,130
I always know when a woman is lying.

183
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,740
You consider yourself an expert?

184
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,090
Real women, yes.

185
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,620
Not your type.

186
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,220
And what type are we, sir?

187
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,740
Army virgins.

188
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,140
Professional cold fish.

189
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,210
Unbreached.

190
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,740
Untouched.

191
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,220
Unloved.

192
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,300
You're trying to provoke me.

193
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,220
You let your guard down
when you spoke Punjabi.

194
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,210
There's something going on
underneath your armour plating.

195
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,210
As you said yourself.
You're no expert on types like us.

196
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,660
Then educate me.

197
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,540
What makes a woman like you put on
a uniform and behave like a nun?

198
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,090
At least a nun gets the ecstasy
of religious rapture.

199
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,660
What do you get?

200
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,940
I help people.

201
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,780
Yes, well, I don't need your help.

202
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,010
I'm only submitting to be good
and get out of here.

203
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,060
Then be good...
and you'll get what you want.

204
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,100
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

205
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,330
Excuse me, sir. Mm?

206
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,570
Um, there's a Private Gorman
outside. He says he knows you.

207
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,210
Who? Gorman, sir.
He's hoping to talk to you.

208
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,980
The name means nothing to me.

209
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,340
That's what he said, is it?

210
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,980
What is he to you?

211
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,570
He's a marksman.

212
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,610
He's the shot.

213
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,170
Even one-eyed.

214
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,010
No-one can bloody touch him.

215
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,090
Well, you see, I'm the shot too,
and he knows it, and he knows me.

216
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,420
Don't matter what he told you.
He knows me.

217
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,770
Think someone was going to cut them
up as rugs for the horses.

218
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,500
They'll need a bit of a shake.
Need more than a good shake.

219
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,930
There's going to be a lot of people
going to this concert

220
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,170
wanting to hear
Miss Marshall singing.

221
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,290
I take it the colonel
will be attending. I believe so.

222
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,570
That's nice.

223
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,130
Shows the proper spirit
of camaraderie.

224
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,290
Will you going to be joining in?

225
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,730
I've often been complimented
on my baritone

226
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,260
but, sadly, a quartermaster's work
is never done.

227
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,980
Sure it will be a very jolly event.

228
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,140
Watch out for that mud.

229
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,020
Are you all right?

230
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:57,610
Rosalie Berwick, you are a Right
Honourable! You're really a Lady.

231
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,300
What judgment are you going to make
of that, I wonder?

232
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,650
It was just a passing remark.

233
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,530
You always think I'm insulting you.

234
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,650
Let's just get on with this,
shall we?

235
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,450
Ohh! Oh!

236
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,700

Major Ballard!

239
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,260
Sir. You remember me?

240
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,330
Let me jog your memory.

241
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,410
My officer put me in a wager
against you,

242
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,010
see who had the best shot.

243
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,610
Long-range and short.

244
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,020
Be a good six months ago now. Yes.

245
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,420
And I won, as I recall.

246
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,170
You did, sir.
It was close, but you won.

247
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,100
My officer lost a fair few quid.
He weren't best pleased.

248
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,410
Yeah, sniper's feet.

249
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,370
Stood in a hole full of water
for five days without moving.

250
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,930
Skin split in me boots.

251
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,410
Still, got me man, though.
He moved first.

252
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,050
HE MIMICS A GUNSHOT

253
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,410
Got him.

254
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,970
Sir, you might have beaten me
back then, but now, I never miss.

255
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,900
Perhaps we might have
that wager again.

256
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,690
Yes, well, you're just going to
have to stay beaten.

257
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,740
I'm due back at the front imminently.
I'll see you up there, then, sir.

258
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,570
At your convenience. I can wait.

259
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,770
I can wait for ever
when I've got a man in me sights.

260
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,300
Sir.

261
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,090
I can't believe
you haven't thought of something

262
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,090
for us to do together yet,
especially when I'm so busy.

263
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,370
I told you, I'm not...

264
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,170
I don't see why you won't sing.
I bet you can.

265
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,050
And I know you can play the piano.
I've heard you in the church.

266
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,250
If someone hummed a tune,
I bet you could pick it up.

267
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,610
You're the one
that's used to performing.

268
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,420
I just... I don't like
being looked at very much.

269
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,730
I just really hoped
we could all do something together.

270
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,220
The three of us. I just thought
it would be so lovely.

271
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,340
All right. I'll sing with you.

272
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,300
I suppose I'll play.

Oh, I never rehearse

Tom, are we really
going to ignore each other?

288
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,300
I'd prefer it, Miss Trevelyan.

289
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,300
You're in my way.

290
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,860
Can't we at least be civil?

291
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,100
I avoid you for a reason.

That's got to be clear.

But now you're in my way,

You think I'm having fun?

297
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,170
I don't know.
Maybe it's entertaining for you.

298
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,450
Maybe you collect men and tie us up
in knots for your amusement.

299
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,530
Well, find someone else
to dance to your tune,

That's supposed to make you happy,

You know, I think you'd be much
better off doing it on your own.

Don't you dare. You...

308

You were the one that persuaded us.
You practically forced us into it.

00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,100
I get such awful stage fright.

310
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,610
I told Colonel Brett

311
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,810
that I'd been really good
in Pirates Of Penzance,

312
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,130
but I froze
and nothing came out of my mouth

313
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,980
and I fell over some scenery
and everybody laughed.

314
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,090
Well, we just won't sing
anything at all, then.

315
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,730
Oh, no. No, you have to.
I've told everybody now.

00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,860
Everybody's expecting it.
You'll be fine.

00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,530
Where are you going?

318
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,730
I'm going to see Cook
about the sandwiches,

319
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,810

00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,380
You just can't stay away,
can you? Hm?

325
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,530
I'm not an invalid. If I need
something, I can get it myself.

00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,900

No. And I'm sorry.

00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,050
There was never any guarantee
that it would get through and...

334
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,050
it might have been stopped

It's not safe here any more.

341
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,050
I'm glad for you both.

342
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,570
I truly am.

343
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,340
It's so late for her to be out.

344
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,340
Yes. We leave now.

345
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,250
I wish I could have brought you
a reply.

346
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,860
I wish I could have helped.

347
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,740
I think I know in my heart...

348
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,620
..that he's dead.

349
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,900
I think I know it.

350
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,260
Good luck, Mr Tillens,
and thank you for trying.

351
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,660
BIRDSONG

352
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,970
Crocuses, daffodils and hyacinths.

353
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,210
I'm going to plant them everywhere,
but I'll start here.

354
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,130
It'll be something to look forward
to, during the winter,

355
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,690
when everything's so dreary,
and it's going to get ever so cold.

356
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,540
But in the spring,
there'll be a carpet of colour.

357
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,690
I feel very bad...

358
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,900
about letting it slip
about your engagement ring.

359
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,500
I wanted to try to make it up to you
a little.

360
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,860
It's probably a bit silly. No.

361
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,420
No.

362
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,340
It's lovely.

363
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,380
I just might not be here to see it.

364
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,220
You're not going to leave, are you?

365
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,130
I mean, none of us might be here.

366
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,300
Oh, yes, of course!

367
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,220
The war might all be over.

368
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,060
Anything's possible.

369
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,980
Nearly anything.

370
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,420
MEN SPEAK FRENCH

371
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,490
Cours a l'hopital,
va chercher l'infirmiere.

372
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,890
On part. On part aujourd'hui.

373
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,850
MAN SPEAKS FRENCH

374
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,180
S'il vous plait...

375
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,650
Pitie... Regardez ca. Pitie!
C'est l'allemand. Oui.

376
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,610
Ce n'est que de la poesie.

377
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,180
Ah! C'est quoi, ca?! Hein? Hein?!

378
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,660
I see what you mean.
Leave it with me.

379
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,450
Ballard.

380
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,340
One moment, Major.
I need to check something.

381
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,540
What's all this about?
It's just routine.

382
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,610
Read this for me, if you would.
Oh, for God's sake!

383
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,380
Haven't you got better things to do?
Just read it for me, please.

384
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,860
Feel free to turn your head,
if it makes it any easier.

385
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,260
This is her, isn't it?

386
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,420
I knew she was watching me.

387
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,050
It could be a variety of conditions.

388
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,730
It could be Stargardt's disease,
although, of course,

389
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,410
we're not allowed to call it that
now, because Stargardt was German.
But...

390
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,020
call it what you will. You're
losing your sight, aren't you?

391
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,930
How in hell have you been coping?

392
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,690
That man in the purple dressing
gown, I can see perfectly well.

393
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,700
You have peripheral sight.
You can see here and here.

394
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,530
No wonder you were in such a rush
to get out of here

395
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,530
before anyone noticed.

396
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,300
There's no push, is there?

397
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,410
How long's
it been getting worse for?

398
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,810
Perhaps over the last year.

399
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,340
And perhaps a rapid deterioration
over the last couple of months.

400
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,850
I'm afraid not answering won't
change the facts. This does happen.

401
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,220
Not to me.

402
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,620
I understand
that this is a cruel blow.

403
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,540
No, of course I don't.
How could I? I'm sorry.

404
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,860
But you can't stay here in France.

405
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,930
Don't send me back
to some hospital in England.

406
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,900
There's nowhere else I CAN send you.

407
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,330
When?

408
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,860
Tonight.

409
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,410
What's the matter?

410
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,210
Anglaise? What's she doing here?

411
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,290
Cherie, ou est ton papa?

412
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,780
Ou est ton papa, cherie?

413
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,620
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

414
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,410
That was a low trick.

415
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,820
That was underhand.

416
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,170
It was necessary. You know,
we're both the same, you and I.

417
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,890
Army, no other life,
above and beyond.

418
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,490
You, more than anybody, should
understand why I needed to go back.

419
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:51,570
And you're an empty husk,
all rules and duty.

420
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,170
You know nothing about me!

421
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,170
Oh, look. Some passion.

422
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,780
Yes, it's a bit too late for that,
though, isn't it?

423
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,900
You need help.

424
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,860
Well...

425
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,610
..when I'm in England,

426
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,930
a country where I've never lived,

427
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,970
when I'm having my food
cut up for me

428
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:17,330
and being poked and prodded
by pitying hands,

429
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,820
when I'm just a diagnosis
on a scrap of paper...

430
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,100
..I shall think of you
standing here...

431
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,220
..and your remorseless help.

432
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,660
DOOR SLAMS

433
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,570
Still with us, then, sir?

434
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,250
All you've got to do
is agree to meet me with a backup.

435
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,810
Shot for shot, prove who's best.

436
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,450
Just agree to meet me. Shake on it
and I'll leave you alone, sir.

437
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,450
You're always yapping at my heels,
aren't you?

438
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,050
Every king must fall.

439
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,330
Must they?

440
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,770
It's just the way of the world, sir.

441
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,540
Now, will you shake on it?

442
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,490
All right, Gorman.

443
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,930
I'll agree to meet you.

444
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,690
You can have your wager.

445
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,300
You can have it right now.

446
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,580
Tu restes la.

447
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,810
Shit.

448
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,380
Sit tight. I'll be back.

449
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,340
Oh, it's Joan.

450
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,980
Go to the house.

451
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,620
Go to the house.

452
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,610
Waiting for you.

453
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,930
Waiting for you. Sh. Waiting...

454
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:16,780
And here was me,
happy to settle for an handshake.

455
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,580
I might have known
you'd always be ready.

456
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,970
When I beat you,
I won't be crowing about it.

457
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,420
You'll have your dignity.
..It's good there, lads.

458
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,380
This do for you, sir?

459
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,540
Set it up.

460
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,820
GUNSHOT ECHOES

461
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,410
Sister Livesey...
He was found on the road.

462
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,010
Where's Mathilde?
Where's his little girl?

463
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,570
She's in Matron's office,
being looked after in the quiet.

464
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,420
She's unhurt, at least physically.
I need to ask you some questions.

465
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,820
Hello there. Here you go, Miss.
Thank you.

466
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,450
It's obvious they think
he was spying. It's just poetry.

467
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,610
No, it's not just anything
if it's found by the wrong people.

468
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,810
Do you know where
they would have been going?

469
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:07,490
Yes. He said they had friends in
London they were hoping to get to.

470
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,010
When did he tell you that?

471
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,770
The last time I treated him, sir.

472
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,010
Right.

473
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,250
Well, try and get these
into some sort of order.

474
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,020
I'll make sure they both get
to where they're supposed to be.

475
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,050
You don't think he's a spy?

476
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,340
I think he's been incredibly naive
and stupid.

477
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,570
Must have stood out like sore thumbs
in that village.

478
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,940
They look different,
they sound different.

479
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,180
What a world...

480
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,770
..where you're beaten up for a book.

481
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,260
Mind you,
he's lucky they didn't hang him.

482
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,580
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

483
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,050
Near miss. Still a hit.

484
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,810
I told you I got better, sir.

485
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,140
Yours might have been a hit, but...
I think I might just have the edge.

486
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,660
Shall we up the stakes?

487
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,340
FOOTSTEPS

488
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,940
GUNSHOT IN DISTANCE

489
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,850
I like you, sir.

490
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,060
I really do.

491
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,060
GUNSHOT REVERBERATES

492
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,980
My turn.

493
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,460
Well, you said you wanted a wager.
You changed your mind?

494
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,460
Never, sir.

495
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,780
(Stop.)

496
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,180
Don't move.

497
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,530
Can you even see him?

498
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,450
Can he what? What did she just say?

499
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,180
I can do this. And if you can't...

500
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,780
..you'll kill him.

501
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,980
Put it down.

502
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,980
You poor bastard.

503
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,900
I can't even call it a victory.

504
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,730
Where's Kitty? How should I know?

505
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,770
Oh! Why did I even say I'd do this?

506
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,900
Well, you did
and now we're doing it.

507
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,890
Leave them!

508
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:21,170
If Kitty doesn't come,
you'll have to sing.

509
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,060
Go ahead. I'll be there.

510
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,370
Mr Tillens... Joan.

511
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,380
You're still
going to get to your friends.

512
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,490
I am so, so sorry.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

513
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,140
Go to the house.

514
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,860
Waiting for you.

515
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:09,020
Oh, why didn't you just let me
go back to my men?

516
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,660
Why did you have to be
such a bloody nurse?

517
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,380
My father...

518
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,850
..was a very difficult...

519
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,740
and a very unhappy man.

520
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,530
I grew up in a house full of guns.

521
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,900
Guns everywhere.

522
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,100
I spent my childhood...

523
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,540
..unloading his guns and trying
to hide the bullets from him.

524
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,500
Of course,
the inevitable happened...

525
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:49,940
..and I spent a long time
blaming myself for his death.

526
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:56,540
So, you feel compelled
to save everybody else.

527
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,780
Was it your father in the regiment?

528
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,220
No.

529
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,380
Are you ready now?

530
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,460
I don't even know
which direction I'm facing.

531
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,450
You know, I still think
you have a question for me.

532
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,300
If you do, you need to ask it now.

533
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:54,300
The Blighty convoy is here, Major.

534
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,900
Sir, in your regiment...

535
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,300
..do you know of
a Subedar Major Amar Singh?

536
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,370
Yes, I do.

537
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,540
He's fallen, I'm afraid.

538
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:22,820
Friend of yours? A passing
acquaintance of many years ago.

539
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:29,740
More than that.

540
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,300
Of course more than that.

541
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,100
Of course.

542
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,130
I always thought...

543
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,860
I'd know if he fell.

544
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,860
Somehow, I always thought I'd know.

545
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,450
You announce it. It's your concert.

546
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,450
No, you announce it.
I don't want to. You're in charge.

547
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,220
Get up there and introduce it.

548
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:37,500
First, we have a musical treat
from The Mikado.

549
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,330
Welcome to the concert.

550
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,820

SINGING CONTINUES IN DISTANCE

557
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:14,220
What are you doing in here?
Why are you going to their house?

558
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:19,290
To get Mathilde's storybook.
The father thought I was you.

559
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:22,410
He said, "Go to the house.
Waiting for you."
What's waiting for you, Joan?

560
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,930
He'd just been beaten.
Of course he wasn't making sense.

561
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:28,340
What's waiting for you
and why can't it come here?
Why do you have to go and get it?

562
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,450
Kitty, get out of my way...

563
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,820
He was beaten up
because people thought he was a spy.

564
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,610
He reads German. Lots of people do.

565
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,220
This fiance
that you tried to keep a secret.

566
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,770
This man that...
that you don't like talking about.

567
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,260
He's not British, is he?

568
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,060
They will crucify you, Joan.

569
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:01,340
They will crucify you.
It's just a letter.

570
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,140
That's all it is.
It's just a letter.

571
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,060
It's going to tell me whether he's
dead or alive.

572
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:13,900
I have to know.

573
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,180
It's just a letter.

574
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,660
Please.

575
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,020
Please.

576
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:53,170
Any singing of mucky songs,
any telling of mucky jokes,

577
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:56,820
I'll know about it
and arses will be kicked.

578
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,740
Now, bugger off. Sir. Thank you, sir.

579
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,010
Come on, Flora.

580
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:27,130
Kitty's not here yet,
so you'll have to sing.

I'm here.

612
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,620
I'm here.

613
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:48,900
I got your letter.

614
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,770

Un, deux...

618
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:17,940
All right? You...

619
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,010
How did you get here?

620
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,690
I was taken prisoner.

621
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,610
I jumped from the train.

622
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:30,220
It's not safe.

623
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,730
You're going to ride away from
the village. There's a crossroads.

624
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,610
Hide yourself there
and watch the road for me.

625
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:43,010
I'm going to get you different
clothes, food, money. No.

626
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,570
I'll think of something. No. No. No.

627
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:48,050
I always think of something. I'm not
leaving you alone with them. Anton.

628
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:50,100
I'm the one
with the British uniform.

629
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,450
I'm not the one they'll hang.

630
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,260
I'm not the one they'll shoot.

631
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,180
You are.

632
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,940
So, you are leaving now.

633
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,060
Watch the road and I will come.

634
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,170
Ich liebe dich.

635
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,740

Good evening, Sister.

What have you been up to?

639
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,050
Your loyalties lie with the enemy.

640
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:15,010
You're as much to blame as she is.
What are you going to do?

00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,730
MAN SCREAMS

642
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,370
All senior staff
are to be questioned

643
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,490
as to his ability
to lead this hospital.

644
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:22,690
- How the hell can it get any worse?
- Control yourself!

645
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,010
No-one doubts you, Roland.

646
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,050
You understand
you're subject to military law.

647
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,860
Conviction by court martial,
you'll be liable to suffer death.
