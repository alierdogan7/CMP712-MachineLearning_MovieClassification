00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,023
No, I was j ust gonna
check with my mates. . .

2
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:41,597
Bang, bang !
You're dead !

3
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:52,474
Don't kiss
your brother, Gemma.

4
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,190
SeveraI hundred fans
without tick ets. . .

5
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,226
are heading to tonigh t's WorId
Cup quaIifier in Rotterdam .

6
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,862
Peter van Zundte
of the Rotterdam poIice. . .

7
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:05,698
says they'II get tough
if there's more troubIe.

8
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:08,468
Those who behave wiII be
weIcome. Those who misbehave. . .

9
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:11,304
they can coun t on a very strict
poIice here in Rotterdam .

10
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,406
We wiII arrest as many
as possibIe,

11
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:17,399
and they won't come out
without being fined . . .

12
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,452
Last nigh t's vioIence
in Amsterdam

13
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,854
seems to have foIIowed
a famiIiar and predictabIe pattern :

14
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,889
Iots of boisterous fans
in bars;

15
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,425
inciden ts invoIving scuffIes
and brok en gIass;

16
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:36,418
poIice move in numbers,
rapid escaIation .

17
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,759
( speaking Serbian )

18
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:02,411
What's going on here?
What's going on?

19
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,628
This is London Transport.
We don't behave Iik e that here.

20
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,897
You don't understand, he's
I do understand .

21
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:14,890
He's a fucking Nazi .
He's a fascist. He's kiIIed . . .

22
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,670
Sit down, pIease.
Nice and quietIy.

23
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,672
You sit down, nice and quiet.

24

He burned my viIIage.

25
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:23,943
I do understand .
His whoIe famiIy was Nazis.

26
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:27,936
Thank you very much, indeed .
We'II con tinue the journey.

27
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:49,191
It's psychedeIic,
isn't it?

28
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:48,644
God, An tonia Fraser
is so bIoody CathoIic.

29
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,830
''Queen Ma, minus fish,
pIus bone.''

30
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,699
Not in the TeIegraph, sureIy?

31
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,534
I'm afraid so.

32
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:05,527
The Queen Mother's chok ed,
on a fishbone.

33
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,042
Oh, I say, there's a nice piece
about you here, Pa.

34
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,845
'''George Thorn ton is one of my most

Prime Minister since DisraeIi?''

42
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,701

WouId you say I was

46
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,575
Of course not. It's ''Private Eye'',
a Ioad of nonsense.

I'm onIy a trainee.

315
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:35,129
Your eyes. . . nice.

316
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,044
Can't eat and taIk

00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,117

No. . . ''Por sha.''

324
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,599
I have aIways supported
the Prime Minister in this matter.

325
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,602
Of course,
we must tigh ten our. . .

326
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,937
immigration poIicy,
but if we don't,

327
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,839
the British taxpayer
once again . . .

328
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,609
wiII be subsidizing
foreign Iayabouts.

329
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,745
On the other hand,
as the Prime Minister says,

330
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:16,114
we must try to do
the decen t thing . . .

331
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:19,518
by genuine asyIum seek ers.

332
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,511
FiscaI responsibiIity
does not excIude compassion,

333
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:28,949
and compassion does not
excIude fiscaI responsibiIity.

334
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:34,032
Thank you

00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,818
It's not environmen taI, obviousIy,

Do you Iik e that?
Oh, yes, yes.

672
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:08,518
That's ''CatacIysm of the Heart'' .

673
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:12,511
MiIk .

674
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:32,909
That's Jerry, my husband .

675
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:36,902
We were chiIdhood sweethearts.

676
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:41,184
And are you stiII happy?
Sorry.

677
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:45,177
No, no. . .
It's a good question .

678
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:55,632
Happy?

679
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:57,066
Dunno.

680
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:59,068
It was aII very exciting,
at first.

681
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:02,872
He moved from radio to teIevision,
and we moved down from GIasgow.

682
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:06,643
They sen t him to America a Iot.
To Washington .

683
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:10,636
ChIoe got to know
her dad on videotape.

684
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:15,985
Then the assignmen ts changed .

685
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:19,978
IreIand, Lebanon,
IsraeI .

686
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:24,060
I mean, Jerry wouId say. . .

687
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,664
there was more chance of him
being kiIIed in Washington .

688
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:31,657
That's the murder capitaI .

689
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:35,727
But at Ieast he understood
the Ianguage.

690
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:39,809
Now the Ianguages are aII . . .

691
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:43,802
they're aII differen t. . .
and mixed .

692
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:48,206
I worry for him .
It scares me.

693
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:54,646
I can't work properIy 'cause
I'm j ust on edge the whoIe time.

694
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:01,998
Sometimes I think . . .

695
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:05,101
why don't we j ust start again?

696
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,403
Buy a croft. . .

697
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:11,396
and go and Iive in peace.

698
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:15,634
WouIdn't that be IoveIy,
Dr. MouIdy?

699
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:20,405
WouIdn't you Iik e
to Iive in a croft?

700
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:19,809
Excuse me, Mr. Higgins, can you
teII me exactIy what happened?

701
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:23,146
Oh, come on .
Roge, pIease.

702
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:25,148
A missing button doesn't matter.
Of course it matters.

703
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:27,750
I said I'd be there
haIf an hour ago.

704
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,252
I'II have you done
in a second .

705
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:31,454
ReaIIy, it doesn't, does it?
Of course it does!

706
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:33,389
No one's gonna notice anyway.
Oh, of course they wiII .

707
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:37,382
Three buttons on one side
and one on the other.

708
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:42,154
A NATO spok esman
praised the RAF piIots. . .

709
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:45,435
. . .this fIigh t began
to bring back evidence

710
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:48,004
of the extraordinary
human wiII to survive.

711
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:50,840
NATO is beIieved
to be considering . . .

712
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,742
How Iong have you
been doing this?

713
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:55,378
But ''wait and see'' is the
poIicy preferred by everyone.

714
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:59,371
''How Iong?''
is the question, Griffin .

715
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:04,253
I am a respected man,
Griffin .

716
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:07,123
I know you don't give
a toss about that, but I do.

717
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:11,127
I do give a toss.

718
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,396
Making a fooI of us aII .

719
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:17,033
You'II end up. . . Iock ed away
somewhere, sIopping out.

720
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:20,036
Your heaIth and your brain
wiII degenerate.

721
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:23,106
Your young heart and your Iungs
wiII putrefy.

722
01:02:23,106 --> 01:02:26,375
You'II die,
and then where wiII you be?

723
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:28,444
You may think
this is a fashionabIe habit.

724
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:31,114
This habit is a terribIe,
awfuI, unimaginabIe. . .

725
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:35,107
''Horror''?

726
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,987
Is that what it is?

727
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:41,390
Griffin, are you hungry?
Do you wan t a sausage roII?

728
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:45,383
. . .Iooking a bit Iost.

729
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:53,458
I've brough t you
some coffee. Espresso.

730
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:57,140
Sweetheart, you've
not eaten anything .

731
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,976
ShaII I . . .?

732
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:03,969
DarIing,
what are you saying?

733
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:07,183
AII my Iife. . .

734
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:11,176
AII my Iife
I've tried to be good .

735
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:16,314
What?

736
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:20,263
I saw it.

737
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:22,131
You saw it?

738
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:26,124
What?
What did you see?

739
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:29,005
It.

740
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:31,808
I saw it.

741
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,877
IT I saw IT.

742
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:36,879
What is it you saw?

743
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:38,981
What. . .?
I saw it.

744
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:42,118
He's not getting it
because I saw it.

745
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:45,488
Me. I saw it.
And he's not getting any of it,

746
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:49,481
'cause I saw it first.

747
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:53,329
I don't understand
what you're saying .

748
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,933
What did you see?
Jerry here. Put Brian on .

749
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:59,368
I'm gonna caII the doctor

750
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:02,038
Yeah, Jerry Higgins

751
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:05,074
Oh, sweetheart.

01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:06,342
I knew this wouId happen .

753
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:10,335
He's j ust not getting it!

754
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,852

761
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:31,000

Don't you ''oId boy'' me,

piece of shit that you are!

766
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:41,410
Look, I'm sorry
about this, but I . . .

767
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:43,045
I reaIIy need that tape.

768
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:45,681
What tape?
The tape in your hand, Jerry.

769
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:47,450
That's my tape.
No, it's not, Jerry.

770
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:50,319
It's my tape!
Doesn't beIong to you, Jerry.

771
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:52,255
It's my tape.

772
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:54,190
No, it's not.
It beIongs to the BB C. . .

773
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:55,925
and I'm here
to coIIect it.

774
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:57,426
It doesn't beIong to the BB C.
It beIongs to me.

775
01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,228
It's my tape. I shot it.
It's mine.

776

We're gonna strip it

783
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:19,181
It's great stuff.
''The HospitaI of HeII''

784
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:21,284
or ''Four Nigh ts in the
HospitaI of HeII,'' depending .

785
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:23,119
It's absoIuteIy
the sort of thing

786
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,021
that's gonna suck
an audience in for us.

787
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:26,622
And it's cost effective,
which is great.

788
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:28,190
So you shouId be pIeased .

789
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,359
Brian, Brian, Brian,
you don't understand !

790
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:32,128

01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:55,664
and the beer is cheap.

823
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:58,200
Do you know,
in my viIIage. . .

824
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,903
the IocaI peopIe can't afford
to buy houses. . .

825
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:03,239
'cause they're aII being bough t up

826
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:06,242
for hoIiday homes.

827

832

I came to buy
an incendiary device. . .

850
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:38,000
from a mate of mine
in the army.

851
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,969
I suppose incendiary
devices are quite hard

As dawn swirIs,
the Bosnian vaIIey echoes

923
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:27,155
to the sound of UN Iorries.

924
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:29,591
The BB C was the first TV network

01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:48,236
and it missed the main bone,
so they didn't have to operate.

953
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:50,639
The probIem is now,
the doctors say

954
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:53,141
in a coupIe of days
my Ieg's gonna be fine,

955
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:54,943

You have Iots of squirreIs

01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:34,890
In my coun try you can eat
animaIs pIen ty. No probIem .

1022
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:38,883
More gravy, Pero?
Okay.

1023
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:46,334
Peero, you know
It's Pero.

1024
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:49,037
Sorry. . . Pero. . .

1025
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:52,207
I am personaIIy very much
against ethnic cIeansing .

1026
01:21:52,207 --> 01:21:54,576
Ah hem . . .

1027
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:57,312
Pero. . . are you reIigious?

1028
01:21:57,312 --> 01:22:01,305
What do you actuaIIy do, Pero?
What's your job?

1029
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:05,353
He's a bask etbaII pIayer.
Bask etbaII?

1030
01:22:05,353 --> 01:22:08,123
Don't suppose there's much demand
for your skiIIs at the momen t?

1031
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:11,660
SkiII?
SkiII .

1032
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:15,653
CapabiIity. Dexterity?

1033
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:20,402
Virtuosity?

1034
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:23,004
Never mind, Pero.
Have some more deer.

1035
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:26,997
AppIe tart is on the way.

1036
01:22:27,976 --> 01:22:30,045
I go. . . toiIet.

1037
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:33,014
What did you say?
I go to toiIet.

1038
01:22:33,014 --> 01:22:36,084
Ah, yes, I see. . . yes.

1039
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:37,986
Word of advice.

1040
01:22:37,986 --> 01:22:39,988
In this coun try,
when we Ieave the tabIe,

1041
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:43,981
we don't say, '' I go toiIet'',
we say, ''Excuse me'' .

1042
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:46,995
In this coun try,
when we Ieave the tabIe,

1043
01:22:46,995 --> 01:22:50,988
we say ''Fuck off! ''

1044
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:55,059
WeII, that cIears up any doubts
we migh t have had .

1045
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:05,080
You can pass the wine,
couId you, Portia?

1046
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,248
I'm not gonna sit here
and Iet you patronize him

1047
01:23:07,248 --> 01:23:10,251
j ust because he's not one of us.
Portia, do shut up.

1048
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:14,244
Fascist.
Anarchist.

1049
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:18,626
I wonder if this is what
the Prime Minister means

1050
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:21,730
by ''FamiIy VaIues'' .
Look at you .

1051
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:25,723
I think he's very. . . foreign .
Very evocative.

1052
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:29,337
Exotic.

1053
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:32,507
I think he's a peasan t.

1054
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:36,177
I'm sorry.

1055
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:39,381
( cIassicaI music on piano )

1056
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:42,584
I don't beIieve it. . .

1057
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:46,577
Excuse me.

1058
01:24:07,275 --> 01:24:11,268
As I said,
the boy is exotic.

1059
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:42,143
Excuse me, sir. . .

1060
01:24:42,143 --> 01:24:46,136
you can't sIeep there, sir.
Come on, mate.

1061
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:52,843
There you go.

1062
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:57,692
Come on, mate.

1063
01:24:57,692 --> 01:25:00,261
If everybody wen t around
sIeeping on the tracks,

1064
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:03,164
we wouIdn't have a raiIroad,
wouId we, sir?

1065
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:05,867
I don't see what harm
I'm doing British RaiI .

1066
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:09,604
You migh t scare the driver, sir.

1067
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:12,774
Have you ever seen
a scared train driver?

1068
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:16,767
Where are you from ?
I'm from Cyprus.

1069
01:25:58,253 --> 01:26:01,556
Oi, nurse!

1070
01:26:01,556 --> 01:26:04,325
Nurse! Come here!
Nurse!

1071
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:07,395
Stop! Gen tIemen, stop!
Stop this!

1072
01:26:07,395 --> 01:26:10,165
Stop it at once!

1073
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:14,158
Stop it!

1074
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:19,963
Get back in to bed .
Fascist.

1075
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:25,813
Fascist.
What?

1076
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:28,783
He is fascist. His whoIe famiIy. . .
Are you a fascist?

1077
01:26:28,783 --> 01:26:30,852
No, I'm not.
He's not a fascist.

1078
01:26:30,852 --> 01:26:34,845
AII righ t? Lie down .

1079
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:38,826
You are here to heaI .

1080
01:26:38,826 --> 01:26:42,497
So start heaIing .

1081
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:46,490
FIower.

1082
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:51,005
This is grass.

1083
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:54,998
And that's a hose pipe.

1084
01:26:56,811 --> 01:26:59,347
For watering grass.

1085
01:26:59,347 --> 01:27:01,783
''Hose pipe''?

1086
01:27:01,783 --> 01:27:04,986
This is swings.
You pIay on them .

1087
01:27:04,986 --> 01:27:08,979
You swing on them,
and pIay.

1088
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:17,254
That's a snaiI . . .
or was a snaiI .

1089
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:21,636
B ye, Dr. MouIdy.
B ye, ChIoe.

1090
01:27:21,636 --> 01:27:23,504
Have a good day.

1091
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:27,497
Tim, Tom !

1092
01:27:34,315 --> 01:27:37,518
Hi, Dad . Hi, Ismet.
No kiss for Daddy? You horrors.

1093
01:27:37,518 --> 01:27:41,055
Hi, Daddum .
Can Ismet come see Mum ?

1094
01:27:41,055 --> 01:27:45,026
It's okay, isn't it?
Come on, Ismet.

1095
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:49,019
Nice to see you, boys.

1096
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:11,875
It's a bit messy.
I Iik e it.

1097
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,636
'' If I no sIeep,
my mother no go sIeep.''

1098
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:32,040
'' If I no chop,
my mother no go chop.''

1099
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:36,033
HeIIo, Pero.
HeIIo, Otessa.

1100
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,889
Who's this?

1101
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:51,392
This is my goIdfish .
HeIIo.

1102
01:28:51,392 --> 01:28:53,628
Is this your coun try?

1103
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:57,365
This is my former town .

1104
01:28:57,365 --> 01:28:59,334
Who's that?

1105
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:01,469
My father, Zika,

1106
01:29:01,469 --> 01:29:03,371
My mother, Kika.

1107
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:07,364
This one?
My sister, Seka.

1108
01:29:09,544 --> 01:29:11,879
My brother, Zoka.

1109
01:29:11,879 --> 01:29:14,549
My former me.

1110
01:29:14,549 --> 01:29:16,584
Why is everything
in your Iife, ''former''?

1111
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:19,721
Because I'm from
former YugosIavia.

1112
01:29:19,721 --> 01:29:23,714
We don't have anything eIse.
We are aII former.

1113
01:29:24,392 --> 01:29:28,385
What about me?
You are my future.

1114
01:29:34,402 --> 01:29:36,637
( in Bosnian )
Oh, heII, here we come!

1115
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:40,630
So, you came back,

1116
01:29:40,675 --> 01:29:42,510
you were unhappy with the British
response to the war,

1117
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:45,179
and you decided
to amputate your Ieg

1118
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:48,015
No, no, no, that's not it.
I inj ured my Ieg

1119
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:52,019
You toId this to your wife,
then to your BB C boss.

1120
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:54,021
They cut off a man's Ieg
in fron t of my eyes.

1121
01:29:54,021 --> 01:29:56,391
No anesthetic,
no pain kiIIers, nothing .

1122
01:29:56,391 --> 01:29:57,892
A cIean cut. Whack .

1123
01:29:57,892 --> 01:30:00,595
His Ieg popped off his body
Iik e a wine cork .

1124
01:30:00,595 --> 01:30:02,897
A UN soIdier treated
my Ieg immediateIy.

1125
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:05,066
Then you smuggIed yourseIf
in to a London hospitaI

1126
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,034
and threatened the nurse
that you wouId kiII her

1127
01:30:07,034 --> 01:30:08,836
unIess she amputated your Ieg .
Yes.

1128
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:10,872
Jerry.

1129
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:13,074
TerribIe, isn't it?

1130
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:15,076
He's suffering
from ''Bosnia Syndrome'' .

1131
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:17,578
Don't worry, it's not as bad
as ''GuIf War Syndrome'' .

1132
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:19,647
This one is curabIe.

1133
01:30:19,647 --> 01:30:23,640
What is ''Bosnia Syndrome''?
I've never heard of it.

1134
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:28,423
It's an obsession
with heIping peopIe. Doing good .

1135
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:30,458
You iden tify with the victim
to the exten t

1136
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:32,794
that you see the worId
through the victim's eyes.

1137
01:30:32,794 --> 01:30:35,663
In severe cases,

1138
01:30:35,663 --> 01:30:37,198
the distinction
becomes so bIurred,

1139
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:41,191
that you become the victim,
and the victim becomes you .

1140
01:30:49,811 --> 01:30:53,648
Pero, do you have a dream ?

1141
01:30:53,648 --> 01:30:55,716
I do have a dream .

1142
01:30:55,716 --> 01:30:59,709
I wouId Iik e to have
safe journey to Mars.

1143
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:06,594
What about the moon?

1144
01:31:06,594 --> 01:31:09,931
I tak e you . Wherever I go,
I'II tak e you .

1145
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:13,924
Are we gonna go to the moon,
or are we gonna go to Mars?

1146
01:31:16,838 --> 01:31:20,831
Listen . . .

1147
01:31:27,782 --> 01:31:31,775
I wan t my chiIdren !

1148
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:39,483
Where are my chiIdren?

1149
01:31:40,528 --> 01:31:44,521
Look .

1150
01:31:47,802 --> 01:31:49,637
Pero, Iook !

1151
01:31:49,637 --> 01:31:53,274
I know.

1152
01:31:53,274 --> 01:31:55,176
What are they doing?

1153
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:59,169
Deportation .
Every day is Iik e this here.

1154
01:31:59,814 --> 01:32:02,617
What do you mean?
Immigration?

1155
01:32:02,617 --> 01:32:06,610
Today is her. . .

1156
01:32:07,688 --> 01:32:09,257
Tomorrow?

1157
01:32:09,257 --> 01:32:13,250
Today is her.
Yeah? Tomorrow?

1158
01:32:16,797 --> 01:32:19,300
We're Tottenham Hotspur.

1159
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:22,803
Tottenham Hotspur FC. . .

1160
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:26,796
are by far the greatest team

1161
01:32:27,241 --> 01:32:31,234
the worId has ever seen .

1162
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,196
Come on, Terry.
I'm dying of thirst.

1163
01:33:55,196 --> 01:33:56,964
Get us a pin t, mate.

1164
01:33:56,964 --> 01:34:00,957
Yeah, aII righ t.

1165
01:34:01,902 --> 01:34:05,172
Oi, oi .
Look who's here.

1166
01:34:05,172 --> 01:34:07,041
AII righ t?

1167
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:09,677
Yeah, aII righ t.
No probIem .

1168
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:10,745
How's the famiIy?

1169
01:34:10,745 --> 01:34:12,179
Mrs. Midge?

1170
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:13,814
Yeah, aII righ t.
They send their Iove.

1171
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:15,716
