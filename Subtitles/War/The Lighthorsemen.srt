1
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,032
On October 31, 1917,

2
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,991
in the third year of the Great War,

3
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,960
two regiments of Australian Lighthorsemen

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,916
charged the Turkish defenses

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,030
Of Beersheba in Palestine

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,230
With bayonets in their hands

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,958
they galloped against machine guns

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,996
rifles and artillery in an eleventh-
hour attempt

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,000
to save the attacking British army
from disaster

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,434
This is the story of some of the men

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,910
and horses who rode into legend that day...

12
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,750
What I'm gonna do to ride a lighthorse?

13
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,991
You're gonna be 18... fit...

14
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,512
capable of somersaulting bareback...

15
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,709
Nothing too much

16
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,473
Hey, Dave, what'd you do up there?

17
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,952
If he wants to do it
you can't stop him

18
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,150
GAZA - KEY FORTRESS OF THE

19
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,877
TURCO-GERMAN ARMY IN PALESTINE

20
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,834
1917
/19

21
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,751
Keep right up, come on

22
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,393
Move it, come on... go on

23
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,713
Right up, men... keep your pace

24
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,910
Watch out, men

25
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,838
So the British thought they could take
Gaza with tanks

26
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,474
They thought they could terrify us

27
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,438
Welcome to Palestine, Captain Reichert

28
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,509
Thank you, Sir

29
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,993
The High Command has sent you to
congratulate me on my earlier

30
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,751
victory in Gaza

31
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,112
News of your triumph arrived before my
departure, but I'm sure they would

32
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,918
wish me to do so

33
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,191
Of course, but all congratulations are
due to the British General

34
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,038
Archbald Murray

35
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,433
For he had captured the town

36
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,114
but he's such a dumb heard

37
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,516
He didn't know and so withdrew
his troops

38
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,396
There's a little joy in the defeat of
the unaware appellant

39
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,959
I realized by a clever young
intelligence officer being sent here

40
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,155
from Berlin...

41
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,674
But I'll tell you with no ill will...
in fact,

42
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,479
I'll suggest the substance of your
first report on me

43
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,352
General Von Kressenstein is supremely
confident that the British

44
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,000
would attack Gaza again and again,

45
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,070
and he would defeat them again and again

46
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,994
Cavalry, Sir

47
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,834
They're not cavalry, Captain

48
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,350
They're Australian Lighthorse Mounted
Infantry...

49
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,148
you can tell them by the plumes
in their hats

50
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,589
They're formidable soldiers

51
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,910
but the English just don't know
how to use them

52
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,751
Wait until the lighthorses dismounted
then we open fire

53
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,592
On the men or the horses, Sir?

54
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,994
Right on the men

55
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,957
Yon don't understand, do you?

56
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,793
You've so much to learn about war
in the desert,

57
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,911
both you and General Murray

58
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,069
See there

59
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,077
Halt, dismounted...

60
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,434
Fall in... take the horses away

61
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,549
Move the machine and set your target

62
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,995
Come on... on the double

63
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,310
Remove the horses out of here

64
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,153
Fire...

65
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,912
There're the men of God who went first
in the battle

66
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,719
Good troops, but again wasted

67
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,917
We're fighting in a desert... warfare
falls

68
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,956
purely in one inescapable rule

69
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,758
Men and horses must drink

70
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,919
A man who carries his small bottle can
travel short distances slowly

71
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,991
and fight when his water lasts

72
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,592
And a horse can fill in with water and
travel long distances quickly and go

73
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,591
without water for one or two days

74
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,349
Then it must drink huge quantity enough
for 30 men

75
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,550
or it'll die horribly

76
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,751
Each time Gaza was attacked

77
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,272
we held out for one or two days the most

78
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,916
And the British were defeated
by the desert

79
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,273
Charlie...

80
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,839
General Chauvel sends his compliments

81
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,235
to General Sir Bourchier Murray as usual...

82
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,275
Yes, Sir

83
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,069
We're running our of time
we're running out of water

84
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,636
and I'm running out of patience
in which my capacity to obey orders

85
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,432
I can't believe

86
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,717
Let me see it...

87
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,710
Leave it with me, Charlie

88
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,556
Halt...

89
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,033
Shall we rest the horse?

90
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,309
No, we keep going...

91
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,512
There're only 50 miles to artillery

92
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,999
Orders didn't say we should go in rush

93
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,391
Yeah, I know... but they can't use us
on the side lines

94
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,000
The British would need every man
that they can get

95
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,275
This regiment's setup is enough
for 10 battles

96
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,598
Hey, easy ginger

97
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,040
It doesn't like bloody guns...
it gets excited

98
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,314
Then blind it...

99
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,794
This is the reason

100
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,279
why we're being separated from the Turks

101
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,669
The High Command worried
that our horses be terrified

102
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,274
that would affect the whole bloody war

103
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,237
You did have a bloody homicide

104
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,629
Why not? But what I said is not misery

105
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,154
I'm just thinking...

106
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,912
What are you thinking? About what?

107
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,513
Why keep us off right of him?

108
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,392
Bothering the Colonel?

109
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,154
Bullshit... Frank is a real soldier...

110
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,434
he has guts doing things

111
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,199
Yeah... but Frank is just a newly promoted
Colonel...

112
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,072
he's still a young guy

113
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,155
The old bureaucrats didn't trust him

114
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,238
Then we're just like Charlie again...

115
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,031
Shall we rest the horse now?

116
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,309
Listen...

117
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,234
I didn't hear anything

118
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,032
That's right

119
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,276
Sergeant, what's the news from Gaza?

120
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,351
Like a bloody disaster, Sir

121
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,588
They're rating 18,000 casualties

122
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,190
Luckily not one of them

123
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,356
They're good ones to be out there

124
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,278
There'd be other ways to stop the war

125
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,239
This is the price we're paying for

126
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,675
What else can we do?

127
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,195
Whoa... you look at that... British soldiers

128
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,313
Now look, Scotty... I take away
this arm badge with smile...

129
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,834
What I don't want to get involved
is any stupid bloody trouble...

130
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,593
Frank, have you ever known me
to start any fight, uh?

131
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,712
No, but I seldom find you finish
with your fuel

132
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,588
Come on...

133
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,439
Don't worry

134
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,715
May God bless us

135
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:27,711
Three cheers for the lighthorsemen

136
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,230
Without you guys here...
situation would not be worse

137
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,469
What would it be?

138
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,320
We're just looking for somebody

139
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,753
That's it is

140
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,233
Goodbye

141
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,196
Australians will be there... hey,
who else will be there?

142
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,395
Who we're looking for?

143
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:56,755
Australians will be there...
hey, who else will be there?

144
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,357
Bloody beautiful...

145
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,033
But not as the pattern sunset
in Calgary

146
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,753
Every one is better than the last

147
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,156
No one knows if he can see
the other one

148
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,511
Nearly two years ago...

149
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:25,158
Jesus, we've already been away
for three years

150
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,675
Have you made any contacts
with your kids?

151
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:35,038
Bloody kids... wonderful I'm so peaceful
here when I miss them

152
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,509
who always drove me crazy home

153
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,397
Your mistress is alright?

154
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,596
Yeah, she's okay...

155
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,074
If I had a fianc? e like Frank's

156
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,077
three years is hell a lot of time

157
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,989
She's worth waiting for...

158
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,150
Worth waiting for?

159
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,515
I'll tell you when he gets back...
the second thing he'll do

160
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,437
is taking his bloody boots off

161
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,509
Very funny...

162
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,955
Chauvel is giving command of
the whole desert company

163
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,634
The regiment will be moving out
within l0 minutes

164
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,519
You said it right... a real bloody thing

165
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,269
What shall we take out of that?

166
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,234
These are our trenches...
the end with bodyguard gone

167
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,352
Past here is Turkish army at Beersheba

168
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,520
We're taking them on?

169
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,919
We'll give ourselves a chance...

170
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,672
We get the best regiment in the brigade

171
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,670
Now we get to prove it

172
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:30,717
Order to advance... ready by the front...
march...

173
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,517
Land of milk and honey...

174
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,639
What the hell it took Myer and the Jews
to come here 40 years ago?

175
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,440
Well, they must have their reasons

176
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,035
What do you think?

177
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,638
Nobody can pass by exceptions

178
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,079
Yeah

179
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,872
We split by two...

180
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,428
Now, let me get him...

181
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,034
It's great

182
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,918
(ln Arab)Someone is chasing me...
shoot him

183
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,954
Son of a bitch

184
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,275
(ln Arab)Go after him... hurry up... retreat

185
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,919
Jesus Christ... thigh gets hit

186
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,878
Are you alright, Frank?

187
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,271
Get the saddle off, Tas

188
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,039
There's a group of Arabs
up the peak valley, Serge

189
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,559
Hey, cover us

190
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,756
Come on, boys

191
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,193
Your leg looks bad, Frank

192
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,836
It holds, Tas

193
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,956
The horse can never make its way back
to the camp

194
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,075
I'd better put it down here

195
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,954
No, let me do it, please

196
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,548
Frank...

197
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,000
How's Frank, Walter?

198
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,992
Oh, not too bad... he's gone to hospital

199
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,313
FORWARD BASE CAMP, ABASAN

200
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,989
I thought we could replace him
by Rick Smith, is it okay?

201
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,513
Can't afford, Walter

202
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,473
You realize there're
only 60 men left with Calgary?

203
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,079
No, Sir

204
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,799
I would like to split them up

205
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,598
Oh, that'll be pathetic

206
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,999
Yes, I agree

207
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,873
I propose to put up reinforcement
in Frank's section... you recruit

208
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,638
They won't like that

209
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,875
Too bloody bad...

210
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,748
Tas... this is Dave Michel, Corporal

211
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,949
Scotty Bolton

212
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,949
Dave

213
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,072
Philip Davis

214
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,198
I let the boys show you the road safe

215
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,154
Where are you from?

216
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,508
Melbourne

217
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,919
City boy?

218
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,237
Not really... I'm from Preston near
Southern

219
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,992
where my Dad gets a dairy farm

220
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,674
That makes all the difference

221
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,270
You'd better put down your kit
somewhere

222
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,709
You can put in my place

223
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,994
Frank's kit is in there

224
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,433
Well, he won't need it for awhile

225
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,591
Alright... till he gets back

226
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,077
Suppose let's see how he rides
with a horse

227
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,709
Easy

228
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,072
How long is it back, Sergeant?

229
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,468
Three weeks... with the regiment

230
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,959
Go on

231
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,955
Not bad at all

232
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,868
The trouble is the Turks
don't stand still

233
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,956
Neither do rabbits

234
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,273
Scotty, you're Scotch, aren't you?

235
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,875
No

236
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,990
Then why they call you Scotty?

237
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,956
Because I'm Irish

238
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,510
What kind of work are you in?

239
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,837
Engineer driver, steam engine

240
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,917
And Tas and Chilla, what about them?

241
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,635
We're all in the wood company...
up in the west

242
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,910
You're all good mates?

243
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,799
Well, I was only there for awhile

244
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,512
What do you think about the food?

245
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,073
Fine

246
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,989
You must get used to this suffrage

247
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,033
Never expect fancy food in the army

248
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,916
This is fancy food, son

249
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,989
Get out there for bully bacon
and biscuit

250
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,073
What you have here you can hardly break
without a shovel

251
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,919
Nor can you boil the dirty Arab well
water without wood

252
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,190
This is real fancy

253
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,039
Why don't you go and tell the cook
Tas when we shall call it a day?

254
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,277
It's not the point of letting anybody
get the idea of beer and mosquito

255
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,636
but gallop and shoot the medal

256
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,438
I know that, Tas

257
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,356
What do you know, a boy fresh from
bloody school?

258
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,948
What the hell do you know about war?

259
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,031
I know it's going to be over 6 months

260
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,233
You say as we thought?

261
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,953
It's what my brother thought
when he joined up

262
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,150
We learned different, didn't he?

263
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,356
Yeah, but he's dead

264
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,114
I'll just go and ask the stable
to keep an eye on my horse

265
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,072
And I enjoyed the party
for my first night

266
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,676
So help me test that big mouth
you deaf?

267
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,832
How about now his brother was killed?

268
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:07,439
So I don't want any kid thinking his
step in Frank's place in this section

269
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,120
(ln Arab)Have pity on us and help us, Sir

270
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,079
Children, piss off

271
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,039
Keep your eyes on the horse

272
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,918
I know, Sergeant

273
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,633
Shall I get someone for your horse?

274
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,200
No, I'm fine... thanks

275
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,714
You don't want to go in
with your mates?

276
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,311
Not that well... it's just the same

277
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,515
Just a couple of minutes, okay?

278
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,997
Good day... where's fruit and flower?

279
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,269
I've got you something better... a letter

280
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,989
Must be from Joyce...
but it's not her writing

281
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,439
Who is it?

282
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,120
Read it loud

283
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,991
Go on, Tas

284
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,955
It's sad to write...
someone gets to tell you

285
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,468
It's better than somebody else
afterwards

286
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:23,395
Joyce married 6 months ago...
they moved to Jeron...

287
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,716
And nobody said a word...

288
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,319
Now well... better off without her, right?

289
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,797
But what upsets me is...

290
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,031
she still takes my pay-offs

291
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,514
Well, boys... you're to go now

292
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,113
Alright, sister...

293
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,148
Good luck, Frank...
good to see you back soon

294
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,912
Yeah, it'll be...

295
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,033
They're watching you...
you're a free man now

296
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,954
Can I get you anything, Corporal?

297
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,313
No, sister... there's nothing I want

298
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,877
You'd better give
that letter a rest... don't worry that

299
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,359
Missing home?

300
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,079
A bit

301
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,430
You're already lucky...

302
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,120
most of us missed home hell of
a lot long enough

303
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,039
That's great

304
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,832
I'll be missing you

305
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,439
What's happening, Tas?

306
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,988
The Turks got a railway up the east...

307
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,595
we saw to it and planned to blow it up

308
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,671
Are you saying the whole regiment
to do that?

309
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,155
They've sent two bloody divisions, son

310
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,073
What'll we do?

311
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,790
What we're bloody told...

312
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,633
It's bloody Turkish cavalry

313
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,668
How would you reckon?

314
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,190
They've been up the scape hundreds
of years,

315
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,071
but you're the first stride

316
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,589
Major Lawson, prepare A Troop
for covering plan

317
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,558
B Troop for dismounted frontal attack

318
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,238
executed when C and D Troops

319
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,993
are ready for mounted advance
from the left flank

320
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,916
After all, son... don't forget
the safety catch

321
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,191
Now, you just stick with me
as close as you can

322
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,680
Chilla is the best lighthorseman
in the regiment, Dave

323
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,955
You'll get him through and backup
if you need me

324
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,556
B Troop, fix blades...

325
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:44,438
A Troop, repeat fire... fire...

326
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,709
B Troop, charge...

327
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,355
(ln Arab)Retreat...

328
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,280
Tas, how can we miss?

329
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,998
To kill enemies is the bottom line

330
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,760
There's no mercy in any warfare

331
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,479
I can't wait to win the battle

332
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,149
or it's a waste of time and lives
for all of us

333
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:32,915
Lads, I just received a bad news

334
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,912
Frank died in Cairo yesterday

335
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,791
Jesus, what happened?

336
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,556
Well, the wound has turned complicated

337
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:51,829
Taking a leak, it got worse...
so they sent him to Cairo

338
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,318
I know what you guys thought about it

339
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,231
I'm truly sorry

340
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,877
Thanks, Sir

341
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,474
It could be a mistake, couldn't it?

342
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,071
They made mistakes all the time

343
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,231
I saw his eyes red when he read
the letter

344
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,757
My eyes just went out of it

345
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,272
Bullshit... you're talking bullshit

346
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,396
Why are you looking at me?

347
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,869
What are you cleaning the rifle for?

348
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,871
Shooting for rabbits?

349
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,872
We lost a bloody best mate

350
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,349
but find to get some gutless stupid

351
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,033
It's been a long time with no death
in the regiment

352
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,719
I'm afraid we can't mobilize soon

353
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,949
No another attack on Gaza?

354
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,076
No, it's just not yet

355
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,555
We'll step up patrol activities so as

356
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,955
to make the Turks aware of our presence

357
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,992
We're moving camp to Tel el Fara...

358
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,196
then towards Beersheba

359
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,992
Padre, what do you know
about Beersheba?

360
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,430
Oh, a very ancient settlement...
thousand years old...

361
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,394
when Christ first traveled
but actually found by Abraham

362
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,960
He dug a well there...

363
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,430
it still exists today, Well of Abraham

364
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,916
He swore some kind of a treaty
with the rulers there...

365
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,913
And so they called it Well of The Oath...
Beersheba

366
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,116
There's a lot of water, isn't it?

367
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,913
FORWARD BASE CAMP, TEL EL FARA

368
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,030
It seems like a nice place...
good for base camp

369
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,510
Dave

370
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,755
Yes, Sir

371
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,115
Has Tas returned from scouting yet?

372
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,309
No, Sir

373
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,194
It's a pity... looking for a change to see
around the area by the wagon

374
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,918
Somebody has to work on the horse

375
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,632
Settle in right?

376
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,036
Yes, Sir

377
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,628
Tas is tough to live with sometimes...

378
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,075
but he's a damn find soldier

379
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,236
I know, Sir... I'm learning

380
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,750
Fine... good work

381
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,116
Air attack

382
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,958
Get the horses... get the horses away...

383
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,117
step up protecting the horses
