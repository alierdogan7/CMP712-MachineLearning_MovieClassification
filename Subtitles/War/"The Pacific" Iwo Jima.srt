00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,272
(theme music playing)

2
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,756
- (waves lapping)
- (gulls cawing)

3
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,926
- (jeep approaches)
- (man shouts)

4
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,431
You've gotta take
more salt than this.

5
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,392
- (men grunt)
- You're just depleting yourself, all right?

6
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,938
(men chatting)

7
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,999
Are my eyes yellow?

8
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,543
Why would
your eyes be yellow?

9
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,296
Come on,
your old man's a doctor.

10
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,298
Look at my eyes.

11
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,092
Give it a rest, Snafu.

12
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,177
Seriously.

13
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,179
I'm getting
that yellow jaundice

14
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,973
that's been going around.
I know it.

15
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,474
The heebie-jeebies.

16
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,518
It's hepatitis
and you don't have it.

17
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,020
I'll catch a fever
then turn inside out

18
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:35,148
through my asshole
like Carson in Love Company.

19
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,070
Come on,
look at my eyes.

20
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,408
- I'm dying, Sledge.
- Hey.

21
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,576
Hey.

22
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,245
Check out my eyes, Jay.

23
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,747
They look yellow?

24
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,251
I just got transferred
out of King.

25
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,627
What?

26
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,795
Where?

27
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,006
Headquarters Company.

28
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,883
Snafu:
Lt'll be all right, Jay.

29
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,261
Shit. You're just
down the road.

30
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,472
Yeah, I'm just
down the road.

31
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:13,395
Least I can do is buy you guys a drink
at the slop shoot.

32
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,028
- (car honks)
- Man on radio: This is NBC,

33
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,904
the National
Broadcasting Company.

34
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,740
(NBC theme plays)

35
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,616
Man #2: Carlo works
at a camouflage factory

36
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:30,078
and Angelo is
a fireman at an army depot

37
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,622
in their home
of Raritan, New Jersey.

38
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,250
Well, you brothers have
a lot to talk over.

39
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,878
What do you say, Carlo?

40
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,883
Well, for one thing, I'd like to be out there
fighting with Johnny,

41
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,469
instead of making
camouflage paint.

42
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,471
That's where
you're wrong, Carlo.

43
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,973
Some guys have
to fight, sure,

44
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,434
but some guys have
to give us the stuff to fight with.

45
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,395
I'll never forget that day
you left for overseas.

46
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,730
Johnny, remember?

47
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,482
All of us kids
at Mom's house,

48
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,609
and after putting away
all that grub.

49
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,903
Ha-ha, that's right.
You got up to go

50
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,946
and all you said was,
"Goodbye, folks.

51
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,615
Be seeing you
in the funnies."

52
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,951
- And that's just what happened.
- Yeah, sure sure.

53
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:13,372
Go ahead, Johnny. Tell us about the night
you killed all those Japs.

54
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,583
Remember? You were out in the jungle,
standing guard form 8:00 till midnight.

55
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,086
- It was raining.
- It had stopped raining.

56
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,922
My guns began throwing
a lot of stuff

57
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,049
and plenty of stuff
was coming back.

58
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,511
I was in charge of two sections
of heavy machine guns.

59
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:30,430
While the enemy was hammering out
our defensive positions,

60
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,267
we fought valiantly to check the savage
and determined assault.

61
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,728
- The fierce frontal attack...
- (people chatting)

62
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,814
- Oh, this is good.
- That's right.

63
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:42,609
- Can I have some more?
- (speaking Italian)

64
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,194
Angelo: Yeah, Dad,
I was so nervous.

65
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,029
I've never been more nervous.
Let me tell you.

66
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,697
Hey, sweetheart,
I was good though.

67
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,658
I sounded like
a movie star, right?

68
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,701
I don't know.
I was shaking like a leaf.

69
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,620
- (speaks Italian)
- Of course, Pa. Of course.

70
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,081
Moses said I sounded like a movie star.
That's me, right?

71
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,086
Carlo: I sound like that too, Pa...
the voice of an angel.

72
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,966
(speaks Italian)

73
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,719
Oh, Johnny,
we're so proud of you.

74
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,557
Ma, all I do is dress up
and say what they tell me.

75
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,976
Well, everyone in America
knows the family name

76
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,811
- because of you, Johnny.
- Carlo: That's right.

77
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,480
I don't want
everyone to know me.

78
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,774
But they do,

79
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,610
because you're so special.

80
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,779
Hey, I get free drinks
because of my hero brother.

81
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,030
- How about that, huh?
- That's right.

82
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,325
- I love that, Johnny.
- Yeah, me too.

83
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,037
(speaks Italian)

84
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,250
- (speaks Italian)
- (Salvatore speaks)

85
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,921
- This looks great, Ma.
- Dora: What's the matter?

86
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,923
- It smells good, Ma.
- Thanks, Ma.

87
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:51,094
- Dora: What did I say?
- Mom, he just needs some time.

88
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,054
That's all.

89
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,309
(typewriter clicking)

90
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,574
- (bucket thuds)
- (water sloshes)

91
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,187
What can
I do for you?

92
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,272
Sir, I joined
the corps

93
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,024
because I knew the marines
were gonna be the ones

94
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,026
who went in first
and the hardest,

95
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,070
and that's how
it worked out.

96
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:54,699
But I've been back
more than a year, sir.

97
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,743
I've done what the corps
asked me to do.

98
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,787
Well, that you have, John.

99
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,122
Well, I see your enlistment's
up in six months.

100
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,708
I'll tell you what...
I'll push through your discharge,

101
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,128
- let you go home now.
- No, sir, that's not what I mean.

102
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,590
My home is
the Corps.

103
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,219
I just can't push
pencils anymore.

104
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,973
Please, let me go back
and train the new kids,

105
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,725
let me help them
the way I know how.

106
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,353
Sergeant Basilone,

107
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,897
you make me proud
to be a marine.

108
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,859
Thank you, sir.

109
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,862
- (car honks)
- (marines chanting)

110
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,159
Sergeant Basilone.

111
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,337
Man: They brought you back
after Guadalcanal?

112
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,506
Yes, sir.

113
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,341
I was
at Tarawa.

114
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,094
No war bond drive
for me though.

115
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,348
I guess it's good to have another combat
veteran training.

116
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,183
Where's the rest
of the company?

117
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,645
I'm told they're coming
in three days... a week.

118
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,648
What would you like to to do
until then, Captain?

119
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,359
Take it easy.
Put your feet up.

120
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,529
Whatever you want.

121
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,163
(typewriter clicking)

122
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,847
(men chatting)

123
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,437
(grunting)

124
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,386
Company! Fall in
on your racks!

125
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,597
Shit.

126
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,271
- Names.
- Tatum, Charles! Private First Class!

127
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,732
Evanson, Steve!
Private First Class!

128
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,319
Well, Tatum, Evanson,

129
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,988
why do I find you in your racks
in the middle of the day?

130
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,907
We've had
no orders, Sergeant.

131
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,618
So you've been doing what you've
been told to do...

132
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,329
- nothing.
- Aye, Sergeant.

133
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,083
As of now you are
the first machine-gun squad

134
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,419
in B Company's
Weapons platoon.

135
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,462
Fall in for PT,
five-mile run.

136
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,382
- Three minutes.
- Aye, Sergeant!

137
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,801
(whispers)
That's John Basilone.

138
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,928
Who the hell is
John Basilone?

139
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,097
Jesus. Do you live
in a cave?

140
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,684
The guy killed like
1,000 Japs on the Canal.

141
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,103
The president gave
him a medal. He's a hero.

142
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,398
Let's go! Let's go!
Move! Move your ass!

143
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,526
You've got to go faster than that!
The Japs are killing your buddies!

144
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,028
Get up that net! Move!

145
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,906
1500 marines waiting
to follow you down that net!

146
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,701
The sea is pitching and rolling.
It's not steady like this.

147
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,412
Now we're doing
the range at 1400.

148
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,038
Go draw your weapons
and stand by to move.

149
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,374
Aye, Gunny.

150
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,626
The Jap banzai charge
is right there!

151
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,462
They're coming,
damn it! Hurry!

152
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,046
You drop that gun,
I'll make you carry it

153
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,965
- for one solid month.
- (grunts)

154
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,010
Teamwork is the key to the Marine Corps
machine-gun squad!

155
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,345
- Set that pin on the tripod.
- Shit.

156
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,223
Get that gun
out of the dirt!

157
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,850
Sorry, Gunny.

158
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,311
You drop your rifle in a firefight,
you die, Tatum!

159
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,188
Drop that machine gun,
fumble with a belt,

160
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,815
your buddies die!
Do you understand?

161
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,400
- Aye, Gunny.
- (both panting)

162
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,323
You cannot
fuck this up, ever.

163
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,409
Lives depend on it.

164
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,370
- Is that clear?
- Both: Aye, Gunny.

165
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,752
Break it down.
Do it again.

166
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,722
(chatting)

167
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,809
- Hey, Greg?
- How you doing, John?

168
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,019
How's the chow, boys?

169
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,271
- Sorry.
- Man: You stupid...

170
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,233
- Man #2: Good hands! Good hands!
- Woman: Lend him a hand.

171
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,528
- Go on, get yourself some more.
- Yes, Sergeant.

172
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,655
Come on, move it.

173
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,659
- VIP on deck.
- Who?

174
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,661
That gunny
with the ocean of hair.

175
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,454
It's John Basilone.

176
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,750
Oh, and he looks
even better in person.

177
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,502
Oh, and here he comes.

178
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,966
Can I give you
a hand?

179
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,134
We've got it
under control.

180
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,554
Are you sure
about that?

181
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,515
Do you see
these stripes?

182
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,892
I'm an NCO
just like you.

183
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,478
I have work to do.

184
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,651
- What's her name?
- Sergeant Lena Riggi.

185
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,738
I'm Lucy.

186
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,032
You know, every Friday

187
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,410
us girls catch
the 6:00 train to LA,

188
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,580
just in case
you're interested.

189
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,084
(swing music playing)

190
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,920
(train whistle toots)

191
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,967
(chatting)

192
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,953
- Sergeant Riggi.
- Yes.

193
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,122
I'm assuming
that's Italian, right?

194
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,875
(chuckles)
Here it comes.

195
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,502
"I'm Italian.
You're Italian.

196
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,005
Hey, we're both probably
related to Joe DiMaggio.

197
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,550
Oh. You know, I know where we can get
the best lasagna in the city."

198
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,761
I could go
for some good lasagna.

199
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,846
(chuckles) Look.

200
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,016
LA is full of girls for a guy like you.
You'll do fine.

201
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,602
Happy hunting,
Sergeant.

202
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,319
- (chatting)
- (pop music playing)

203
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,285
- Sergeant.
- Gunny.

204
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,872
- If that's all right with you.
- Sergeant Basilone.

205
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,210
(Lena laughs)

206
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,003
- Yeah.
- That's right.

207
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,297
That's... oh, really?

208
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,841
This is so nice.
I love it here.

209
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,010
Man:
To better days.

210
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:17,100
- Hey.
- (chuckles)

211
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:21,104
Boy, it's true what
they say about you.

212
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,898
You get shot down,
you keep coming back.

213
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,651
What? Everybody comes
to the Biltmore, don't they?

214
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,861
(chuckles)

215
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,197
There's another medal
in your future

216
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,117
- if you can get us a table.
- How long have you been waiting for?

217
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,494
We gave up waiting.
It's like this every liberty.

218
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,371
Well, I'll see
what I can do.

219
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,581
And what would
that be, exactly?

220
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,542
Making a table appear
out of thin air?

221
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,836
They know me.

222
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,424
Oh, hey.

223
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,509
Big shot here
thinks he can get us a table.

224
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,929
- I want to make him prove it.
- Lucy: No.

225
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,599
You go. I'm thinking
ofjoining the navy.

226
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,105
Looks like it'll
just be the two of us.

227
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:22,623
This place is bigger than
the house I grew up in.

228
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,126
Yeah, I never ask for it,

229
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,295
but they always put me up
in the Presidential Suite.

230
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,381
And I'm supposed
to be impressed?

231
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,134
That's why
you arranged all this?

232
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,137
To impress me before
we get down to business?

233
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,056
Business?

234
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,850
Exploring
the bedsheets together.

235
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,478
No.

236
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:47,315
Well, that's standard
operating procedure for you, isn't it?

237
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,234
No. Not anymore.

238
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,915
You know, I saw you once
at the Brown Derby.

239
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,584
Me and the girls were
waiting to get in

240
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,712
when you arrived with one of those
blonde starlets on your arm.

241
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,715
There you went, right to the front
of the line,

242
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,802
and everyone was
saying, "Ooh. Ah.

243
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,805
There goes John Basilone,
the hero of Guadalcanal."

244
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,265
The line to get in
was so long

245
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,810
I was still there
when out you came,

246
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,561
a brunette starlet
on your arm,

247
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,563
and back into
the same limousine.

248
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:31,109
And everyone said,
"Ooh. Ah.

249
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,319
There goes John Basilone,

250
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,696
the hero of Guadalcanal."

251
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,659
You ever make it inside?

252
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:43,121
I had a shrimp cocktail and a Coke
just before they closed the joint.

253
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,336
Gunnery Sergeant Basilone,
dinner was delicious.

254
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,588
- Thank you.
- You barely touched it.

255
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,966
Did I do
something wrong?

256
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,094
This is nothing
but steaks and conversation.

257
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,013
I am now going
to turn in.

258
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,432
- Turn in?
- We girls all share a room,

259
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,268
fight over the bathroom
in the morning.

260
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,687
Tell the chef the Caesar salad
was excellent.

261
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,313
The porterhouse is
a little tough.

262
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,067
Lena,

263
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,570
if I did something stupid,
I'm sorry.

264
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,072
You didn't do anything
a million other guys haven't done.

265
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,242
You just did it
in a nicer room.

266
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,997
(door opens, closes)

267
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:32,336
- Man: Left right left.
- Men: Left right left.

268
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,590
John:
Gunnery Sergeant Basilone, sir.

269
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,884
Stand at ease.

270
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,094
I'm Lieutenant Sohn.

271
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,263
I'll be replacing
Captain Le Francois,

272
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,141
who went AWOL
while on liberty.

273
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,435
How are the men
shaping up?

274
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,312
All two of them?

275
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,564
The rest of the company
comes in today from Mainside.

276
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,066
They'll be
pretty green, Gunny.

277
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,485
Don't worry sir.
I'll take care of that.

278
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,321
Well, you haven't
got much time.

279
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:02,074
Your enlistment
runs out in... July.

280
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,662
I've been
in eight years...

281
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,624
four with the doggies,

282
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,584
four in the Corps.

283
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,629
I understand.

284
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,300
(men grunting)

285
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,885
Get up that tower!

286
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,057
- Go!
- Get off my wall, marine! Get off!

287
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,850
John:
One more time!

288
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,937
Up that
cargo net! Now!

289
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,481
Man #2:
Keep moving, boy!

290
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,942
(panting)

291
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,570
What is this,
a mob?!

292
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,739
In formation,
two ranks behind me.

293
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,450
- Oh, come on.
- Man: Move it!

294
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,160
Move your ass!

295
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,954
Man #4:
Let's go. All right.

296
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,122
(all panting)

297
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,291
(chatting)

298
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,797
- Okay, that's the last of the butter.
- 26 Ibs.

299
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,302
Private Dowling, grab a hand truck
and get those sacks of rice.

300
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,680
- Got it?
- Grab those from the bottom.

301
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,228
All perishables go
in the reefer.

302
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,938
All right.

303
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,649
Sergeant Riggi.

304
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,860
Gunny Basilone.

305
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,655
This may not
be appropriate, but...

306
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,198
Hold on.

307
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,577
Just a couple more
and we'll have all this cleared out.

308
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,539
Uh, I would be happy

309
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,166
if you would allow me
to take you out for a proper dinner.

310
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:37,753
- When?
- Friday night,

311
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,672
a place I know
just off the base...

312
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,924
- a restaurant.
- Clancy's?

313
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:46,679
- So you know it too.
- Nice place, but no.

314
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,314
Friday's no good for me.

315
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,691
I have orders...

316
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,484
a big banquet
for the officers.

317
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:04,405
- Maybe some other time?
- How about breakfast?

318
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,824
Tomorrow morning.

319
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,951
The KP reports 0530.

320
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,786
I show 0500.

321
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,414
Show up a little earlier,
I'll make you French toast.

322
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,923
(door bangs)

323
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,967
Every marine out of those racks
and on my deck!

324
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,469
Man:
Get your ass up!

325
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,179
John:
You've got five seconds!

326
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,556
- Five seconds!
- Man: Up up!

327
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,433
- Let's go!
- Move your ass!

328
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,311
Get up! Move!

329
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,813
Don't you eyeball me!
You stand at attention!

330
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,982
And how come we're the only ones
running like this?

331
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,568
- Every damn morning.
- To make us the best.

332
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,279
Oh, shut up.
I'm so sick of this shit.

333
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,490
I just want to get
out there and slap a Jap.

334
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,622
What did you say?

335
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,125
- I said I want to slap a Jap, Gunny.
- (men chuckle)

336
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,757
"Slap a Jap"?

337
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,635
Well, how about it, boys?

338
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,554
I bet you all want
to do more than slap a Jap.

339
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,391
All:
Yes, Gunny!

340
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,559
"Slap a Jap."

341
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,857
That's what the enemy is
to you, huh?

342
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,903
A fucking bucktoothed
cartoon dreamed up

343
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,073
by some asshole
on Madison Avenue to sell soap.

344
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,076
Well, let me
tell you something.

345
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,662
The Jap I know,

346
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,164
the Japanese soldier,

347
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,250
he has been at war

348
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,422
He's a combat veteran,

349
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,757
an expert
with his weapon.

350
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,593
He can live off
of maggoty rice

351
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,263
and muddy water for weeks
and endure misery

352
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,683
you couldn't dream up
in your worst nightmare!

353
00:23:57,185 --> 00:24:00,312
The Japanese soldier
doesn't care if he gets hurt or killed,

354
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,065
as long
as he kills you.

355
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,819
Now you can call them
whatever you want,

356
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:10,614
but never ever fail

357
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:15,286
to respect their desire to put you
and buddies into an early grave!

358
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,622
- Is that clear?!
- Yes, Gunny!

359
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,541
Why aren't you
in your full packs?

360
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,084
Gear up!

361
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,921
10-mile run
in formation

362
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,966
- in two minutes!
- (men shout)

363
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,325
You're gonna
enjoy this.

364
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,828
Almost ready.

365
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,961
Pretty fancy for 0500.

366
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:09,673
(Lena laughs)
You strike me as an Italian mama's boy,

367
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:13,219
worshipped and pampered
just like my brothers.

368
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,763
I wanted to make
you feel at home.

369
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:19,058
Well... I was told

370
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,851
at a very early age
I was the best thing

371
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,812
- since sliced capicola.
- (laughs)

372
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,940
And there's enough
for seconds.

373
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,942
- You'll want seconds.
- This is good.

374
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,153
(chuckles) When I first got here,
the coffee was dreadful.

375
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,822
How a marine mess can serve
bad coffee is beyond me.

376
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,991
I can't live
without it.

377
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,370
The best coffee I ever
had was on Guadalcanal

378
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,121
the morning
after the battle.

379
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,123
- I know the story.
- Not this part.

380
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,419
We stole some coffee from the doggies
when they came ashore.

381
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,505
Liberated some hooch
from their officers too.

382
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,299
Anyway, the morning
after the battle,

383
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:55,386
my guys cooked up the coffee
over a fire of green coconut logs.

384
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,471
There wasn't any part
of me that didn't hurt...

385
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,974
burns on my hands,

386
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,310
ears still ringing
from the shelling.

387
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,065
But when they handed me
that cup of coffee,

388
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,150
I never tasted
anything so good.

389
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,319
Not that I don't
appreciate this.

390
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,157
What was the best cup
of coffee you ever had?

391
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,664
My parents were
real traditional.

392
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,459
I was supposed to get married
and give them grandkids.

393
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:31,130
So when I announced
that I'd joined the marines,

394
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,549
there was a lot
of yelling and crying

395
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:37,428
and finally my father
just stopped talking to me,

396
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:41,056
cut me out
of the family.

397
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,852
A year later I got my stripes.
I went home to see my mom, my brothers.

398
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,855
I was sitting
in this diner

399
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,440
and my pop walked in,

400
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,402
sat down beside me.
He ordered two cups of coffee

401
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:57,823
and he put the milk
and one sugar in for me.

402
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,119
That was the best
I ever had.

403
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,918
It's incredible what can happen
over a cup of coffee.

404
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,468
My enlistment's up
in July.

405
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,305
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

406
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:25,184
You're gonna take a discharge
and you're gonna go home.

407
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,272
I should be looking
forward to my freedom,

408
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,192
but I can't imagine it.

409
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,319
I love the marines.

410
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:39,031
You do too.
I love everything about it.

411
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:43,035
I can't imagine being anywhere
or doing anything else.

412
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,751
- Lena.
- Yeah?

413
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,005
You might hear this
all the time,

414
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,926
but you're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

415
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,765
No.

416
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,643
I don't hear that
very often.

417
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,229
Must be the uniform.

418
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,566
- (girls laughing)
- I could use a coffee.

419
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,860
(chattering)

420
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,863
- Shh, she's with the movie star.
- Interesting.

421
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,448
- Woman: Yeah.
- Woman #2: Look at Gunny.

422
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,659
Woman:
A little early morning.

423
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,620
(gossiping, laughing)

424
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,633
- Clear!
- Clear.

425
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,885
Tatum, Evanson, set it up.

426
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,471
Two short bursts,
85 rounds.

427
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,311
Ready!
Gun set.

428
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,063
Fire!

429
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,403
That's good.

430
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,822
Nice.

431
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,533
John:
Listen up!

432
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,786
This is a bale.

433
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:11,582
It'll make it easier to carry the gun
with a hot barrel.

434
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,209
You won't burn
your hands.

435
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,545
Now it's not made for its
stability and accuracy

436
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,465
but if you're
in a pinch,

437
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:22,634
you can shoot
and move with this.

438
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,803
Let me show you.

439
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,525
I couldn't hit the side
of a barn with that thing.

440
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:46,533
You'd better
start practicing.

441
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,494
Yeah.

442
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,500
Lena:
It's gorgeous.

443
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,668
- John: Come on, let's go in the water.
- No.

444
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,296
- Come on, come on.
- No, I'm not going in that water.

445
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,714
- Come on.
- No way.

446
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,509
- No!
- John: I'll get you.

447
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,094
(squeals)
I'm not gonna have you drown.

448
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:09,848
No, put me down.

449
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,391
- Put me down.
- We're going in.

450
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,394
No!
Oh, my hat.

451
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,647
My hat.
My...

452
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,774
I'll get it.

453
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,695
John, you're crazy.

454
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,116
- Ah!
- (laughing)

455
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,830
(gasps)
I got it!

456
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,885
Oh no.
Oh no, you don't.

457
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,638
Don't you dare.

458
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,330
(soldier shouts)

459
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,921
(plane passes overhead)

460
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,799
Attention on deck!

461
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,472
Stand easy.

462
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,521
Gentlemen, the 5th Division
will ship out very soon

463
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:43,066
for action in the Pacific
theater of war.

464
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:46,111
We won't know our destination
until we're well underway.

465
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,031
But wherever we go,

466
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,533
we will see
the job through.

467
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,245
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir!

468
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,210
I have some more
good news.

469
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,588
Gunnery Sergeant
John Basilone

470
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,673
has decided
that home can wait.

471
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,594
He will be joining us.

472
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,388
(silent)

473
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,973
Carry on, Gunny.

474
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,892
Atten-hut!

475
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,021
(door closes)

476
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,940
At ease.

477
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,946
- So is anybody scared?
- AIl: No, sir.

478
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:33,116
- I said is anybody scared?
- (shouts) No, Sergeant!

479
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,870
You lying sacks of shit.

480
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,705
(scattered laughter)

481
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,791
It's good to be scared.

482
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,585
It means you're awake,

483
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,879
you're ready.

484
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,928
Company dismissed.

485
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,222
(chatter)

486
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,976
Man:
You ready? You scared?

487
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,160
- Woman: It's not ready yet.
- Woman #2: Oh, okay.

488
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,788
Woman:
Can I have a bowl this time?

489
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,833
(chattering)

490
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,841
She's back there. Lena?

491
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,391
- Hey.
- Hey to you.

492
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,602
Out with it.

493
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,272
- Out with what?
- Whatever grim tidings

494
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,233
you men carry around
with you like rock sacks.

495
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,712
I've shipped over.

496
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,881
I've re-enlisted.

497
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,216
I see.

498
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,178
They can ship me out
whenever they want.

499
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:19,639
So if you're looking
for something else,

500
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,142
somebody in a different
line of work,

501
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,977
tell me now.

502
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,481
That sounds
like an ultimatum.

503
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:30,150
- I'm just saying...
- Look.

504
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,737
I'm in for the duration
plus six months.

505
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,782
I know how it goes,
Sergeant.

506
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,328
So?

507
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,580
Where do we go from here?

508
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,291
(laughter, cheering)

509
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,959
Congratulations!

510
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,253
Lucy: Stay there.
I'm gonna take a photo.

511
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,468
You look so beautiful.

512
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,470
Lucy, let me
get a shot.

513
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,180
No, you stay there.
I want to take it.

514
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,140
No, I want a shot of Lena
alone in that dress.

515
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,643
Look here, darling.
Try not to blush.

516
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,062
I feel like
a paratrooper.

517
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,898
- I don't know why I wore this dress.
- You look beautiful!

518
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,317
Be-au-ti-ful!

519
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,028
(camera clicks)

520
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,698
Okay, John, go pose with your wife.
Let's make it official.

521
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,868
Whoo!
(crowd cheering)

522
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,538
Now kiss her
like you mean it.

523
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:27,165
- I can do that!
- (laughter)

524
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,417
(hooting, cheering)

525
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,836
(gulls cawing)

526
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,510
(laughs, squeals)

527
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,180
Don't you touch me.

528
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,030
(panting)

529
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,531
Hold it.
Wait.

530
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,575
What?

531
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,911
Go stand
over there.

532
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,886
Take your clothes off.

533
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,138
What?

534
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,934
Do it.

535
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:33,476
John, what have we done?

536
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,229
We've gone respectable.

537
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,276
You know...

538
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,194
I woke up one day

539
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,238
and I was 30 years old.

540
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,615
Satisfied.

541
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,410
Then you walk
into my mess hall,

542
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,287
and look at me now.

543
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,913
Just wait
and see.

544
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:57,417
- We're gonna have six kids.
- That's a lot of kids.

545
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,629
You should have
come around 10 years ago.

546
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,472
Little boys
for you to pamper,

547
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,433
and little girls
for me to drive crazy.

548
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,774
I'd like that so much.

549
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,987
This is yours now.
I want you to wear it.

550
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,105
- You want some food?
- Dear God, yes.

551
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,732
Let me see
what I can rustle up.

552
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,959
What?

553
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,024
(explosions)

554
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,787
(grunts)

555
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,873
(screaming)

556
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,924
(whimpering)

557
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:22,520
Look at me!
I said look at me!

558
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:28,151
You want to live?
Get off the beach.

559
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,069
Move!

560
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,197
Soldier:
Help, help me.

561
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,076
(shrieks)
Help me!

562
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,078
Corpsman!
I need a corpsman!

563
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,626
Move it back.

564
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,676
Get off the beach!
Keep moving.

565
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,512
(screams)

566
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,180
Keep moving.

567
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,890
Don't stop.

568
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,558
Keep moving!

569
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,894
Get off the beach.
Keep moving.

570
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,149
Off the beach!
Get up!

571
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,318
Move!

572
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,613
- Someone help me!
- (screaming)

573
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,490
Help him back.

574
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,618
Off the beach!
Off the beach, get off!

575
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,332
Evanson, Tatum,
let's go.

576
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,419
Get the fuck off the beach,
you sons-of-bitches!

577
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,108
(gunfire)

578
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,827
(soldier wails)

579
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,625
Set that fucker up here.

580
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,335
Move!

581
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,888
We gotta kill the bunker.
Get me a rabbit team.

582
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,640
Get your charges
ready to move.

583
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,267
Soldier:
Captain, up here!

584
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,769
Aim for the gunport.

585
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,813
Short bursts.

586
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,277
Go go!

587
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,238
(gun firing)

588
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,574
Keep firing!

589
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,380
It's jammed.

590
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,609
Pegg!

591
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,028
All right, Gunny!

592
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,534
Go, move forward!

593
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,246
Further up!

594
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:30,124
Here!

595
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:34,671
Let's go!

596
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,757
Go go go go go!

597
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,556
(shouting in Japanese)

598
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,437
(screaming)

599
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,650
Fire in the hole!

600
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:57,819
Let's go, let's go!

601
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,654
- Get in, get it.
- On me!

602
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,656
Flamethrower up!

603
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:23,177
(screams Japanese)

604
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,352
Move!

605
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,355
- Go go.

(screams)

607
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,425
Tatum!

608
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,361
Take out that machine gun
and set up position!

609
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,657
Tatum, clear
the back line!

610
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:35,082
Hold your fire.
Go go go!

611
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,010
Stay low, stay low!

612
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,494
- Those are ours!
- (plane roaring)

613
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,249
Tatum, set the gun
up there!

614
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,875
They're firing
for the ridge.

615
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,836
Go go!
Move move move!

616
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,879
Down low.
Steve, Steve, lower!

617
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,133
Do not leave this position
come hell or high water.

618
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:29,136
- Do you understand?
- Both: Aye, Gunny.

619
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,408
(tanks creaking)

620
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,476
You tell that tank

621
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:18,853
<i>- Aye aye.</i>
- Move!

622

Let's go!

623
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:23,399

much ammo as you can find

624
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,444
- and get off the beach!
- Aye, Gunny.

625
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:40,291
We're fucked.
What are we gonna do?

626
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,126
Get that gun over here!

627
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,549
