Radio newscaster:
This is the Australian
Broadcasting Commission.

00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,006
And now the news.

4
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:25,508
Japanese forces continue
their heavy attack

5
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:29,262
on the Philippines
and Dutch East Indies.

6
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,131
Occupation of Manila
is now complete

7
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,016
with American
and Philippine forces

8
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,136
(explosion)
under the command
of General MacArthur

9
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,638
withdrawing
to the Bataan Peninsula.

10
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,523
His Majesty's forces
are carrying out

11
00:00:40,523 --> 00:00:43,026
an orderly evacuation
of the New Guinea coast

12
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:46,780
in preparation for defense of
Port Moresby and the southern...

(whistling "Pass Me By")

34
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,443
Here, just a minute.

35
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:01,831
Where do you think you're
going with those, hmm?

36
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:04,334
am?
Do you know who I

37
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:06,836
Um, not exactly, no.

38
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:09,339
Well, we'll let
it go this time.

39
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,851
nd.
Yes, sir.
I understa

40
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:24,354
Salamaua will be
cleared by noon
the latest.

41
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:27,473
Nothing left that
the Japanese will
be able to use, sir.

42
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,976
Sir, there's a chap
outside who...

43
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,227
May I respectfully
remind the admiral

44
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:33,730
that I was harbor master here
for nearly 20 years.

45
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,981
I helped put the docks together

46
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,483
so I should certainly be able
to blow them apart.

47
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,735
Sir, there's
a chap outside

48
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:40,620
who's pinching our petrol...

49
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,871
l
Yes, sir, 
all our coasta

50
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:43,740
watching stati
ons are assigned,
except, uh...

51
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,991
Matalava, sir.

52
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,242
ir.
Except Matalava, s

53
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:46,876
I haven't been able

54
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:48,745
to find a replacement
for Anderson.

55
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:50,630
I don't believe
there's a civilian left

56
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,881
on the entire
north coast.

57
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:53,132

George Dickens
from the inter

59

.
if he hadn't
got himself
eaten that way

60
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:59,389
You needn't make him sound
such a shirker, Stebbings.

61
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:00,640
What's that, sir?

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,508
For want of a nail,
the war was...

63
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:05,011
Yes, I'm well aware
of that, sir.

64
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:09,399
Hello, hello, hello.

65
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:11,901
r.
I think I ma
y have found
our nail, si

66
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:13,152
A rusty one,
I grant you, sir

67
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,655
er.
but they don't
come any sharp

68
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,523
.
Excuse me, sir

69
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,026
Sir, that's the chap
I was telling you about.

70
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,277
He was...

71
00:04:21,277 --> 00:04:23,162
Later, Stebbings.

72
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:26,916
Who is he, sir?

73
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,785
Is he someone
I should know?

74
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:30,670
His name's Walter Eckland,
an American.

75
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,790
He knows these islands
like the back of his hand.

76
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,041
Oh.

77
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,926
Oh, well, now that
America's in the war

78
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:38,795
.
he's probably
on his way
back to enlist

79
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:41,297
Eckland's not on his way
anywhere, Stebbings.

80
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:43,182
Hasn't been for years.

81
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:46,302
(humming)

82
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:47,553
Hello, Walter.

83
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,439
(stops humming)

84
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,690
Frank!

85
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,558
That you inside
there, Frank?

86
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:53,810
What have you
done to yourself?

87
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,061
There's a war on, Walter.

88
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:56,946
Everybody's saying that.

89
00:04:56,946 --> 00:04:59,449
At the moment,
we're losing it.

90
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:01,951
Guess you must be.

91
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,454
Cheek of the man.

)
(whistling

93
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:08,207
That's quite
a boat you hav
e there, Walter.

94
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,076
Doesn't it belong
to old Vanderhoeven?

95
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,327
No.

96
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:12,578
en?
Whose is it th

97
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:13,212
Mine.

98
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,464
?
How did you get it

99
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:16,332
I bought it
from old Vanderhoeven.

100
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:17,583
h?
What wit

101
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,469
American dollars.

102
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:21,971
You've never had
more than $200
at one time

103
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:23,840
since I've known
you, Walter.

104
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,342
u
You can't tell me th
at Vanderhoeven sold yo

105
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:27,593
an $18,000 lau
nch for $200.

106
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:28,845
No. It cost me $400.

107
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:30,730
?!
$400

108
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,232
You know, that's exactly
the way he said it.

109
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:36,352
Only I pointed out to him
he might as well sell it to me

110
00:05:36,352 --> 00:05:38,237
than let the Japanese
have it for free.

111
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:41,357
.
What impresses me,
Walter, is the fact
that you even had $400

112
00:05:41,357 --> 00:05:42,608
Well, I didn't.

113
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,494
I only had $200,
just as you said.

114
00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:45,745
I owe him the rest.

115
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:46,362
Well, come along.

116
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:47,613
Lend a hand.

117
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:48,865
Come on.

118
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:50,116
Empty hands
make idle minds.

119
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,618
Here, pick those up.

120
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:53,870
No, no, no, no.

121
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,121
Two. Come on.

122
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,257
?? Contemplating nature
can be fascinating... ??

123
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,377
?
You know what
the coast watching
service is, Walter

124
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:02,628
I beg your pardon?

125
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:03,880
ce?
The coast
watching servi

126
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:05,765
It's a chance
to become a hero.

127
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,016
Why would I
want to do that?

128
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:08,267
It's a cushy
assignment

129
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,770
for anyone who knows
these waters intimately.

130
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,272
With never a dull
moment, I can tell you.

131
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,524
Working behind
the enemy lines

132
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,643
No, no. Stebbings.
not knowing from
one moment to the next...

133
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:18,277
Please.

134
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,529
me.
Walter,
listen to

135
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:20,780
There's nothin
g to it, really.

136
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,282
Each man is assigned
an island, often
uninhabited.

137
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:26,402
He stays there alone
and he radios to headquarters

138
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:27,653
any movement of Japanese

139
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:28,905
ps.
planes
or shi

140
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:31,407
?
You're not listening
to me, are you, Walter

141
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:32,658
Hold it, hold it.

142
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:33,910
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

143
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,161
Come on. Beat it!

144
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:35,795
Scram! Come on!

145
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:37,046
Get off!

146
00:06:37,046 --> 00:06:38,915
Did you hear
what I was saying?

147
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:40,166
No. What were
you saying?

148
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,417
About the coast watchers.

149
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,920
Matalava will be
in the center of things

150
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,422
when the Japanese start
moving towards New Guinea.

151
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:48,307
It's important work,
Walter.

152
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:48,925
Damned important.

153
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:50,810
I'd like you to volunteer.

154
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,061
Oh, I'd love to, Frank

155
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:53,312
but I've only
just volunteered

156
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,815
for another important
watching service--

157
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,683
The Watch Out
For Walter Eckland service.

158
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,186
A great many liv
es are at stake,
Mr. Eckland.

159
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,437
Now, listen to me,
both of you.

160
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:03,940
Several years ago,
I made peace with the world.

161
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:06,442
Now, if the world
isn't bright enough

162
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:07,693
to make peace with itself

163
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,579
it'll have to settle things
without me.

164
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:11,447
It isn't anything
permanent, Walter.

165
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:14,584
It's just until I find
a replacement for you.

166
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:16,452
The other man
went down with fever

167
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:18,337
and we had
to take him off.

168
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,840
Well, now, Frank,
you've known me a long time.

169
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,960
Do you really think
you're going to talk me into it?

170
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,713
No, I suppose not.

171
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,850
Stebbings, confiscate
all the small craft
on this pier.

172
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,718
But this is
the only one
there is, sir.

173
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:33,970
Confiscate it.

174
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,855
Frank, you won't
get away with that.

175
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,723
Proceed with your orders,
Stebbings.

176
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:38,357
ir.
Aye-aye, s

177
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:40,226
Frank, you can't
do this to me!

178
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,477
I'll go over your head.

179
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:42,728
Who's in charge here?
He is.

180
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,614
Frank, you can't
do this to me.

181
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:45,865
That boat's all I have.

182
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,116
You said we've
been friends

183
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:48,985
for a long time,
Walter.

184
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:51,487
Do you really think
you can talk me
out of it?

185
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,995
If I go to Matalava,
I can keep the
boat, right?

186
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:00,880
Mmm.

187
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,748
Well, there's
no use fighting it.

188
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,000
ff?
What time do I shove o

189
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:06,502
An hour be all right?

190
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:07,753
Anything you say, Frank.

191
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,005
.
You're the skipper

192
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,758
Hey, buddy, lend me a hand
with those cans.

193
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,010
I'll get on board.

194
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,512
m
Uh, sir, you don
't really expect hi

195
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:18,397
to go to Matalav
a, do you, sir?

196
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,266
bor
As soon as
 he clears har

197
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,517
n.
we'll never
see him agai

198
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:24,020
Where's your faith
in human nature, Stebbings?

199
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:25,271
(humming)

200
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,156
Oh, yeah.

201
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:28,407
(explosion)

202
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:55,885
Good heavens!

203
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:58,387
What is it?

204
00:08:58,387 --> 00:08:59,639
He...

205
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,725
he made a gesture, sir.

206
00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:23,629
(shouting):
You set a fine course,
there, Walter.

207
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:24,880
My compliments.

208
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,132
Yeah.

209
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,017
I should have led you
up on the reef.

210
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:31,771
It's a sorry day when a man's
friends don't trust him.

211
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,639
What about all those provisions?

212
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,776
You don't suppose that boat
of yours could carry them?

213
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:41,147
Frank, I want you to take all
those provisions

214
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,649
and I want you to...

215
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,534
Hey! Be careful

216
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:47,403
with that.

217
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:59,131
We'll be at King's Point
in Australia.

218
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:02,885
When you call us,
we want you to use
the following code:

219
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:05,388
King's Point is "Briar Patch."

220
00:10:05,388 --> 00:10:07,256
I'm "Big Bad Wolf."

221
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:09,141
Stebbings here
is "Bo-Peep."

222
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,644
And you're...

223
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:12,895
"Mother Goose," sir.

224
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:15,398
That's it--
you're "Mother Goose!"

225
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:17,850
Now, try to remember
all that, Walter.

226
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,101
It's bloody
important.

227
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:20,353
Yeah-- bloody.

228
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,604
All right, then.

229
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:24,106
Good-bye, Mother Goose.

230
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:25,992
"Mother Goose."

231
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:26,609
(chuckling)

232
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:28,494
Let's get underway,
Stebbings.

233
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,614
Sir, it has occurred to me
that as soon as we've gone

234
00:10:31,614 --> 00:10:32,248
Mr. Eckland might...

235
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,116
Proceed, Stebbings.

236
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:35,368
Hard to port.

237
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,253
All right, sir.
Coxswain, hard...

238
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:39,755
Excuse me, sir, but,
uh, did you say...?

239
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:41,624
Hard to port, son.

240
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:42,875
Aye, aye, sir.

241
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,760
Coxswain, hard
to port.

242
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:54,136
Hey, hold it, hold it!

243
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:55,354
Are you crazy?!

244
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,605
Look out! Look out, Frank!

245
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:57,857
Did you hear me?

246
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,108
Hard to starboard,
Frank!

247
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:00,976
Hold it now! Watch out!

248
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:02,228
Oh, you've gone nuts!

249
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,730
Look out.
Frank, can you hear me?

250
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,981
Hold it!

251
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:07,867
Starboard, you English,
silly son of a...

252
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,735
(crash)

253
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:14,740
Oh, great!

254
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,991
Have you lost your minds?

255
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:17,243
Look at my boat!

256
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,128
Terribly sorry, Walter.

257
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:21,630
Our steering must have jammed.

258
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,882
I'm sorry.

259
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,384
If you didn't know how
to work one of those things

260
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,635
why didn't you say so?!

261
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:27,887
I'm sorry.

262
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,389
Oh, stop saying that!
Look at my boat!

263
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,258
What am I going to do now?!

264
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,760
Become a coastwatcher,
I expect.

265
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,514
Lucky we put all those
supplies ashore.

266
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:39,765
Oh, Walter?

267
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,902
We'll stand by
until you get safely in.

268
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,770
Frank, I'll sue you!

269
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,021
I'll sue!

270
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:47,907
I'll sue the entire war!

271
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,158
Quite right, Walter!

272
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,026
I'll be your witness.

273
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:52,278
Oh, and Walter?

274
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,414
Thanks for volunteering.

275
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,417
(bird squawking)

276
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,307
Oh, come on. Buzz off.

277
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,061
(engines droning)

278
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,573
(squawking)

279
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:53,332
(loud, shrill squawking)

280
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,633
(sighing)

281
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,136
Houghton:
Mother Goose?

282
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,387
Frank!

283
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,256
I knew you wouldn't
leave me here!

284
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,392
Mother Goose,
this is Big Bad Wolf.

285
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,261
Go away.

286
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,763
I know you're saying something,
Mother Goose

287
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,266
but I can't hear you.

288
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,402
You've got to flip the key.

289
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,271
I said go away.

290
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,156
You're still not coming through,
Mother Goose.

291
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,024
There's a button
on the microphone.

292
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:12,778
You have to press it down
while you're speaking.

293
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,663
(belching)

294
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,532
Can you hear me now?

295
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:17,783
That's better.

296
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,668
You'll find some
charts there, Walter

297
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,788
identifying enemy ships
and aircraft.

298
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,039
Study them, will you?

299
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,291
Oh, sure.

300
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,542
Have you seen anything yet?

301
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:27,793
Any planes or ships?

302
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,044
Yes, a plane.

303
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:30,296
Ours or theirs?

304
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,798
Kind of depends which side
you're on, doesn't it?

305
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,683
Walter,
news has just come through

306
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,552
that the Japanese
took Singapore this morning.

307
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:37,803
Frank...

308
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,054
(clearing throat)

309
00:15:39,054 --> 00:15:40,940
What keeps them
from taking Walter Eckland?

310
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,442
We've 32 spotters
spread over 3,000 islands.

311
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,311
So, you see, the odds
are in our favor

312
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,196
that you'll never be found.

313
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,447
Ourfavor?

314
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:52,201
You're not stuck out here
in the middle of nowhere-- I am!

315
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,452
Now, when do I get off?

316
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,703
I've told you--

317
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,206
as soon as we can find
a replacement for you.

318
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,326
Meantime, be good enough
to keep in touch, Walter.

319
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,211
Oh, and I am sorry
about your boat.

320
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:02,828
I really am.

321
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,331
Is Big Bad Wolf really sorry?

322
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,718
Because if he is,
Big Bad Wolf and Little Bo Peep

323
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,838
can do something
for Mother Goose.

324
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:13,472
They can go...

325
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,341
(chuckling)

326
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,477
I don't really
blame him, do you?

327
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,980
I can't see that
we've accomplished
anything, sir.

328
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,231
I don't think
he'll report in.

329
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,099
I mean, you can lead
a horse to water

330
00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:25,351
but can you
make it drink?

331
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,487
When he gets thirsty enough,
he'll drink, Stebbings.

332
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:29,738
He'll drink.

333
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,748
Frank, can you hear me?

334
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,251
Frank?

335
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,371
Loud and clear,
Mother Goose.

336
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,622
What is it?

337
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:48,507
Where'd those men of yours
put the whiskey?

338
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,758
I've been looking
all over this dump.

339
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,261
You don't suppose they kept it
for themselves, do you?

340
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,129
Seamen of His Majesty's Navy?

341
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:55,381
You must be joking.

342
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,266
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Where is it?

343
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,134
Well, I can imagine
how dull it must get

344
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:01,637
for someone left all alone
on a small island

345
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:02,888
so I decided...

346
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:03,522
All right. All right.

347
00:17:04,139 --> 00:17:04,773
Get to the bad news.

348
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,608
Well, I decided
to liven things up a bit

349
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,111
by making a sort of
fun and game thing out of it.

350
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,613
What sort of fun and games?

351
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,116
I had my men hide all the
bottles around the island.

352
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,618
In very unlikely places.

353
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,121
You'd never find them
by yourself.

354
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,989
The ground rules are simple.

355
00:17:20,989 --> 00:17:23,492
You report an enemy ship
or plane movement

356
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,994
and I tell you where
the bottles are.

357
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,246
One report, one bottle.

358
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,131
Um, um, hold it a minute, Frank.

359
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,999
I hear a flight going over
right now.

360
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:32,251
Yeah, isn't that odd?

361
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,753
Now just a minute while I get
the binoculars.

362
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,507
Oh, yes, there's six, seven,
eight of them

363
00:17:38,507 --> 00:17:39,758
heading south.

364
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,895
They're, uh, uh, Nakajima 97s.

365
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,763
But just a minute
while I verify that

366
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,648
on one of these
little old charts.

367
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,768
Walter, there is another rule
attached to this.

368
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,653
It has to be a confirmed report.

369
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,522
"Confirmed"? Confirmed how?

370
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,024
By other spotters
along the line.

371
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,276
(chuckles)

372
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,527
Now just tell me

373
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,663
what all those planes were
that you saw, hmm?

374
00:18:22,484 --> 00:18:24,987
(aircraft approaching)

375
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,002
(whistles)

376
00:18:42,504 --> 00:18:44,373
(whistling)

377
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,258
(humming)

378
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,022
Frank!

379
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:01,273
Frank! Frank!

380
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,775
Frank, wake up, Frank!

381
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,027
Frank?!

382
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,529
Briar Patch here, Mother Goose.

383
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,398
Bo Peep speaking.

384
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,649
"Briar Patch"? What's that?

385
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:11,900
That's a new one, isn't it?

386
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,152
We've moved.

387
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,403
Oh, you're at King's Point
already?

388
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:17,539
Listen, Mother Goose,
you must use the code names.

389
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:19,408
If you don't like it, fire me.

390
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,042
Now get Houghton.

391
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,293
The regulations say...

392
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,544
Frank here, Walter.

393
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:23,795
Mother Goose, sir.

394
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,047
What's new?

395
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:26,915
Five Mitsubishi light bombers

396
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,418
at around 10,000,
headed southwest.

397
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:33,805
Southwest at ten thou.

398
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,057
Got it, sport.

399
00:19:35,057 --> 00:19:36,308
Thanks.

400
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,177
Now, wait a minute. Whoa!

401
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,428
It's fun and game time now.

402
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,679
I played the game,
how about the fun?

403
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,815
Confirmed, Walter, remember?

404
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,067
But Frank, I swear.

405
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:46,318
Well, in that case

406
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,187
you have nothing to worry about,
have you?

407
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,072
Sit tight, Mother Goose.

408
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,077
"Sit tight. Sit tight."

409
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:57,346
(Morse code beeping)

410
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:06,104
Briar Patch here.

411
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,356
Are you there, Mother Goose?

412
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,607
I'm here, Frank! I'm here!

413
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:09,858
I'm here!

414
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:11,109
We've just received news

415
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,995
that your report has been
confirmed.

416
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:14,246
Congratulations.

417
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,114
Never mind the congratulations.

418
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,366
Where is it?

419
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:19,251
(chuckles)

420
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,371
Proceed 50 yards east

421
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:24,256
northeast to a large rock

422
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,376
then 20 yards due east
to a coconut palm."

423
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,878
No, no.
Not so fast. Not so fast.

424
00:20:29,878 --> 00:20:31,763
Wait a minute. "Large rock..."

425
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,632
20 yards due east
to a coconut palm.

426
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:48,480
(squawks)

427
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,568
Sir.

428
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,075
Sorry to disturb you
at this hour, sir

429
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,944
but we've heard
from Humpty-Dumpty.

430
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,195
Oh, come on, Stebbings.

431
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:20,829
You can tell me.

432
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,698
Who's Humpty Dumpty?

433
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,200
(quietly):
Perry on Bundy Island.

434
00:21:28,337 --> 00:21:32,090
He reports enemy landings
here on Desfare

435
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,959
here and here on Greater
and Lesser Tomango

436
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,461
and here on Prince Concert.

437
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,930
They've ringed him in
pretty well, haven't they?

438
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,182
He says they don't know
that he's there yet

439
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,684
but he expects somebody
along at any time now

440
00:21:42,684 --> 00:21:43,935
and requests
to be withdrawn.

441
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,804
Well, combat can't spare
a thing, Stebbings.

442
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:47,689
All our planes and
ships are committed.

443
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:48,940
Who's our nearest man?

444
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,312
I'm afraidheis, sir.

445
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,882
Stebbings:
Briar Patch calling
Mother Goose.

446
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,750
Come in, Mother Goose.

447
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,887
Briar Patch calling
Mother Goose.

448
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,389
Come in, Mother Goose.

449
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:08,760
Do you read me, Mother Goose?

450
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,263
This is Briar Patch.

451
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,486
Do you read me, Mother Goose?

452
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:18,737
Yes, yes, I read you.

453
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,605
What's even worse,
I can hear you.

454
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:21,857
Now what do you want?

455
00:22:21,857 --> 00:22:24,359
Walter, I haven't been sleeping
too well

456
00:22:24,993 --> 00:22:26,862
because I've treated
you so badly

457
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:28,113
so I'm going
to make it up to you.

458
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,998
Whatever it is, Frank,
the answer is no.

459
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:31,867
I don't blame you, sport.

460
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:33,118
I don't blame you at all.

461
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,003
I'm not listening, Frank.

462
00:22:35,003 --> 00:22:39,374
But supposing I got someone
to repair your boat for you?

463
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:40,625
I'm listening, Frank.

464
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,511
And after it's repaired

465
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:45,013
to stay on there
as your replacement?

466
00:22:45,013 --> 00:22:46,264
Who is he?

467
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:49,384
Malcolm Perry.
He's one of our regulars.

468
00:22:49,384 --> 00:22:50,635
When can he be here?

469
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,521
Tonight too soon?

470
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,389
No, Frank. Tonight's just fine.

471
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:55,640
Just fine.

472
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,526
There's just one small thing.

473
00:22:57,526 --> 00:22:59,394
Uh-oh.

474
00:22:59,394 --> 00:23:02,531
He's not able to get to you, so
you'll have to go and fetch him.

475
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:03,782
From where, Frank?

476
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,033
Bundy Island.

477
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,536
Bundy?!

478
00:23:07,536 --> 00:23:09,404
How do you suggest
I get there, Frank?

479
00:23:09,404 --> 00:23:12,541
Well, that launch of yours
has a dinghy, hasn't it?

480
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,043
All those miles of open sea
and back again

481
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:16,294
in a seven-foot dink?!

482
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:17,546
You're nuts!

483
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:18,797
(chuckles)

484
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:25,670
Shall I call him
back, sir?

485
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,922
No, no.

486
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:29,424
Frank?!

487
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:31,309
Yes, Walter?

488
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,178
Suppose I could make it
to Bundy.

489
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,063
Where would I put in,
the south jetty?

490
00:23:35,063 --> 00:23:36,314
That's right.

491
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,183
Only be careful.

492
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,434
There's a pretty fair moon
tonight.

493
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:43,188
You got some special reason
for telling me that, Frank?

494
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:46,324
No. Only it's a bit better
without a moon.

495
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,193
Why, Frank?

496
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,329
Well, Bundy's liable
to be occupied.

497
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,198
With what, Frank?

498
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,083
I didn't say it would be.

499
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,334
Frank?

500
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:56,952
Yes, Walter?

501
00:23:57,586 --> 00:23:58,837
Kiss my foot, Frank.

502
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,208
(chuckles)

503
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,459
If he leaves
within the hour

504
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:06,962
he should make Bundy
just after dark.

505
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:08,847
But, sir, you heard
what he said.

506
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,715
He won't go to Bundy.

507
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:13,852
Frank?!

508
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,103
Yes, Walter.

509
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:16,354
All those miles of open sea

510
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:19,474
a man would need something
to keep warm, wouldn't he?

511
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:20,108
Two bottles.

512
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:21,977
All of them, Frank.

513
00:24:21,977 --> 00:24:22,611
Three.

514
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:23,862
All of them, Frank.

515
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:25,730
Five.

516
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,616
All of them, Frank.

517
00:24:30,118 --> 00:24:31,369
Got a pencil?

518
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:40,128
Number four is ten yards west
of the shack under a mango.

519
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:46,384
Five is 30 paces from there,
due north in a stunted palm.

520
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,253
Just a second. Slow it down.

521
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,505
Number six is...

522
00:26:17,626 --> 00:26:19,494
Perry?

523
00:27:10,178 --> 00:27:12,047
(glass clatters)

524
00:27:42,711 --> 00:27:44,579
(clicking button)

525
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,082
(silence)

526
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:06,484
(yelps)

527
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:10,855
Who are you?

528
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,741
I...

529
00:28:12,741 --> 00:28:13,992
I asked you first.

530
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,494
Where's Perry?

531
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:17,746
Who's Perry?

532
00:28:17,746 --> 00:28:19,614
Perry, the man who lives here.

533
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,117
I buried him.

534
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,002
He was dead!

535
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,870
I found him here.

536
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,373
A Japanese plane
must have attacked the house.

537
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:31,509
How did you get here?

538
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,761
I...

539
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,880
Duck!

540
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,273
They've passed
by before.

541
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:47,142
I think they're landing

542
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,027
on the other side
of the island.

543
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,529
What makes you
think that?
Well, I saw them.

544
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,032
If you want to look,
there's a place over there.

545
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:55,900
Why would I do a silly thing
like that?

546
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,152
Come on. Let's get out of here.

547
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,403
Do you have a boat?

548
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,539
No, I walked.

549
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,408
Come on.

550
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,293
Come on.
We're leaving now.

551
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,162
Huh?

552
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,067
Look out.

553
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:30,935
Come on, look out.

554
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,821
Just a...

555
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:34,689
Just...

556
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,826
What...
what are all those?

557
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:39,694
As you can see,
they're young ladies.

558
00:29:40,328 --> 00:29:40,945
Now, listen, Miss...

559
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,831
Whatever your name is.

560
00:29:42,831 --> 00:29:44,082
Oh. Freneau.
Catherine Freneau.

561
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,333
Charmed.

562
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:46,584
Now, suppose you tell me...

563
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:47,836
What is your name?

564
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:49,087
Uh, Eckland.

565
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,338
How do you do?
How do you do?

566
00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:51,589
Now, Miss, I don't know

567
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,458
what this is
all about, but...

568
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,960
Please, Miss...

569
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,463
Miss?

570
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,097
Shh.

571
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:00,965
Where is your boat?

572
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,217
I can't see it.

573
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,719
Lady, it's right
where we're standing.

574
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,604
If you spit, you'd sink it.

575
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:07,856
Oh, dear.

576
00:30:07,856 --> 00:30:09,107
Oh, well.

577
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,975
I suppose we'll just
have to manage.

578
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,227
Come on, girls,
into the boat.

579
00:30:12,861 --> 00:30:14,112
Wait, wait, wait,
wait a minute.

580
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:14,729
Hold it.

581
00:30:15,363 --> 00:30:15,980
Everybody settle down.

582
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:18,483
You don't think they're all
going to fit in that?

583
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,368
All right, Mr. Eckland

584
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:23,488
which ones do you
suggest we leave behind?

585
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:29,127
You decide.

586
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:32,247
I'll leave it to you.

587
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,886
It's suicide.

588
00:30:37,886 --> 00:30:40,388
Would you stand a better
chance without me?

589
00:30:40,388 --> 00:30:41,005
Naturally.

590
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:42,891
Very well.

591
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:46,010
Well, I suggest you
leave immediately.

592
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,513
Well, that's really
very decent of you.

593
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,147
You're a very good sport.

594
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:50,398
Thank you.

595
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:51,649
Now, the rest of you
snap it up.

596
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:52,901
All right.

597
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:54,152
Jenny, you're
the smallest.

598
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:54,769
Sit in the back.

599
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:56,020
You'll be out of the way.

600
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,272
Do you mind, lady?

601
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,157
This is my boat,
such as it is.

602
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,025
If anyone's going
to sink her, it'll be me.

603
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,277
Now, I'll seat them.

604
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:04,779
You sit in the back.

605
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,030
Give it to me.

606
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,282
Let it go.

607
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:07,916
Mr. Eckland.

608
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,784
This is not theQueen Mary.

609
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,035
There's no room for baggage.

610
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,287
Come on, you.

611
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,172
My glasses.

612
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:17,926
I don't want to go.

613
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,177
Oh, that's tough.

614
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:20,428
Come here.

615
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,182
Please take your hand off that.

616
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,433
All right.

617
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,302
My scent.

618
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:27,936
Huh?

619
00:31:27,936 --> 00:31:29,187
Scent.

620
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:30,438
It's called Anticipation.

621
00:31:30,438 --> 00:31:32,307
Two pounds ten the ounce.

622
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,558
You don't say.

623
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,809
All right.

624
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:36,694
Now sit there.

625
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:37,946
That's right.

626
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:39,197
Take you hands off that.

627
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,065
(yells)

628
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,951
What is that thing?

629
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:44,202
A cricket bat.

630
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:45,453
Isn't it a smasher?

631
00:31:45,453 --> 00:31:47,322
Yeah, a smasher.
I only hope you all can swim.

632
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,573
Take your hand off that.

633
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,458
Now, you two, get in
the bottom of the boat.

634
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:52,327
Get in the bottom
of the boat.

635
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,578
They don't
understand English.

636
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,463
Sure they do.

637
00:31:55,463 --> 00:31:57,332
See?

638
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,583
(yells)

639
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,834
Please.

640
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,337
All right.

641
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,588
Now, I guess
that's about all.

642
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,473
Don't forget Gretchen.

643
00:32:05,473 --> 00:32:06,090
What?

644
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,976
Don't forget Gretchen.

645
00:32:07,976 --> 00:32:10,478
Oh, that's her friend.

646
00:32:10,478 --> 00:32:12,347
I'll help her in, dear.

647
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,598
Would you mind?

648
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:17,352
Oh...

649
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:21,739
Now, then, Mr. Eckland, I
suggest you leave immediately.

650
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:23,608
Oh, lady, lady,
do you mind?

651
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,859
Just get in the boat.

652
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,110
Well, you said it would...

653
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,362
I don't care what I said.

654
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,247
If, by some miracle,
we do make it

655
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,498
I'd be stuck with them.

656
00:32:30,498 --> 00:32:31,115
Now, get in the boat.

657
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,367
All right.

658
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,001
Come on.

659
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,252
That's right.

660
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:35,503
No, no, no, no!

661
00:32:35,503 --> 00:32:37,372
Not that.

662
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,257
We'd have had
a use for that.

663
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,125
Come on. Come on.

664
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,879
(girls squealing)

665
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,130
Now, don't be afraid.

666
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:46,764
Quiet, quiet.

667
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,267
Mr. Eckland, please
keep the boat quiet.

668
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,135
The girls are extremely
frightened.

669
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,021
Will you shut up, lady?

670
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:54,889
Now, here,
get off my paddle.

671
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,140
Well, I'm terribly sorry

672
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,277
but you put it there in
the first place, you know.

673
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:02,397
Now, that's all right,
children, don't be scared.

674
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,648
There we go.

675
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:31,075
Mr. Eckland...

676
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:32,960
Must you?

677
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,463
What are you, some kind
of religious fanatic?

678
00:33:35,463 --> 00:33:37,965
I couldn't care less
what you do to yourself

679
00:33:37,965 --> 00:33:40,468
but must you do it
in front of the children?

680
00:33:40,468 --> 00:33:41,719
No.

681
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:42,336
Well, then.

682
00:33:42,336 --> 00:33:44,222
Well, then, tell them
to turn around.

683
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:49,227
That is not exactly
what I had in mind,
Mr. Eckland.

684
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:49,844
Now, lady...

685
00:33:50,478 --> 00:33:52,346
The name is Freneau.
Catherine Freneau.

686
00:33:52,346 --> 00:33:54,849
I don't know what
you had in mind.

687
00:33:54,849 --> 00:33:56,734
I don't even know
who you are

688
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:57,985
or what you were doing
on that island.

689
00:33:58,603 --> 00:33:59,237
Well, if you must know

690
00:33:59,854 --> 00:34:01,105
an American plane
left us there.

691
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:02,990
We were on our way
from New Britain...

692
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,242
I want to go home.

693
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,493
Oh, Anne, it's rude
to interrupt.

694
00:34:05,493 --> 00:34:07,361
We were on our way from
New Britain to Port Moresby

695
00:34:07,995 --> 00:34:09,864
when the pilot was ordered
to pick up eight survivors

696
00:34:09,864 --> 00:34:12,366
of a Australian bomber that
had crashed in the water.

697
00:34:12,366 --> 00:34:13,000
Unfortunately...

698
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,252
Hey, you, take that bat

699
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,120
or whatever it is
out of the water.

700
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,371
It's acting like a rudder.

701
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:19,257
Harriet, really.

702
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:20,508
The name's Harry.

703
00:34:20,508 --> 00:34:22,376
All right, Harry.

704
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:24,879
He said he'd try and come
and pick us later

705
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,764
but that was five
hours ago, and he...

706
00:34:27,381 --> 00:34:28,633
Quiet.

707
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,518
You don't have
to be so rude.

708
00:34:30,518 --> 00:34:33,638
Quiet, I think I hear something.

709
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:36,774
(rumbling)

710
00:34:49,904 --> 00:34:51,155
Duck.

711
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:52,406
What? What's
the matter?

712
00:34:52,406 --> 00:34:54,292
Put your heads down.
Do as I tell you.

713
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,543
Keep your faces covered.

714
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,175
Harry, keep
your face down.

715
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,911
Are they Japanese?

716
00:35:29,911 --> 00:35:31,162
I don't know.

717
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,030
Do you want me to ask?

718
00:35:47,428 --> 00:35:49,297
Hold on.

719
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:51,182
We've got to ride out
the wake.

720
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:52,433
Girl:
We're sinking.

721
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:54,936
Well, don't just sit
there, damn it, bail.

722
00:35:54,936 --> 00:35:57,438
Mr. Eckland, your
language. Really.

723
00:35:57,438 --> 00:35:58,689
Just bail.
Do as I say.

724
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,558
Come on,
you can move
faster than that.

725
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:03,694
Come on, all of you,
Use your hands... anything.

726
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:04,946
Come on, keep bailing.

727
00:36:04,946 --> 00:36:06,197
Faster.

728
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,448
Bail!

729
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,317
Why aren't you?

730
00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:13,704
Come on now, get to work.

731
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:14,956
Go on.

732
00:36:14,956 --> 00:36:17,458
That's better.

733
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:18,709
Hold on to the boat,
Harry.

734
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:19,327
Hold on.

735
00:36:19,327 --> 00:36:20,578
Hang on to the boat.

736
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,885
Well, really.

737
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,005
Come on, girls.

738
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,507
All right, come on.

739
00:37:06,507 --> 00:37:08,392
Come on, Anne.

740
00:37:14,015 --> 00:37:17,151
King's Point, get Houghton.

741
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,654
Is that you, Mother Goose?

742
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:24,025
Walter, I can't tell you
how delighted I am.

743
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,494
Oh, you've Mother Goosed me
for the last time.

744
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,362
What are you talking about?

745
00:37:28,362 --> 00:37:30,248
Now don't play stupid with me.

746
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,750
You'd sell out your own father
if you knew who he was.

747
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,001
(clattering)

748
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,870
(girls speaking French)

749
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,755
Walter, what happened? Walter?

750
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,624
Frank, get them off of here.

751
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:40,875
Get who off?

752
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:42,126
You know who.

753
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:43,377
Get them off.

754
00:37:43,377 --> 00:37:45,263
No one could have known
we were there, Mr. Eckland.

755
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,514
The radio was destroyed.

756
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,382
Will you please stay out
of this, lady?

757
00:37:48,382 --> 00:37:49,634
Freneau:
I'm only trying to...

758
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,387
Eckland:
I'm quite capable of handling
this myself, thank you.

759
00:37:53,387 --> 00:37:54,021
Girl 1:
I'm hungry.

760
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,273
Girl 2:
So am I.

761
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,775
Walter, what's...?

762
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,278
(girls shouting)

763
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,780
Walter, who's...?

764
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,900
Walter!

765
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:09,036
Thank you.

766
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,905
Now, suppose you tell me
who's there?

767
00:38:10,905 --> 00:38:12,156
Well...

768
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:14,041
I am Miss Catherine Freneau.

769
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,293
Who is this, please?

770
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,795
Commander Frank Houghton
of His Majesty's Navy.

771
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,046
Who are you, Miss Freneau

772
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,298
and what
are you doing there?

773
00:38:20,915 --> 00:38:22,800
I'd like to hear
that myself. Go ahead.

774
00:38:23,417 --> 00:38:25,303
I am the daughter
of Charles Freneau

775
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,171
the French Consul at Rabaul.

776
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:28,422
I heard children's voices.

777
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:29,674
Yes.

778
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,559
I am in charge of seven students

779
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,810
from the consulate school.

780
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,313
Four English, two French,
one Australian

781
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,432
all of them daughters
of diplomatic personnel.

782
00:38:38,432 --> 00:38:39,684
When the bombing started

783
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:42,186
it was decided to evacuate
them to Australia.

784
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:44,689
Unfortunately, the plane
our group was on

785
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:45,940
put us down at Bundy

786
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,076
and now Mr. Eckland has been
kind enough to bring us here.

787
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:50,945
What about Malcolm Perry?

788
00:38:50,945 --> 00:38:52,830
Well, I'm sorry, Commander.

789
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,950
The house apparently had been
attacked from the air

790
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,835
and when we found him...

791
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,086
Oh, I'm sorry.

792
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,338
Commander, how soon

793
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:02,206
do you think
you'll be able to...

794
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,091
arrange for our
transportation?

795
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,960
I'd like to hear
that as well, yeah.

796
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,462
That's a difficult question
to answer, Miss Freneau.

797
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,348
If you'll just be
a little patient...

798
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,850
Oh, never mind
their patience, Frank.

799
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,467
It's my patience.

800
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:14,719
Get them off of here.

801
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,805
All right, Walter,
I'll take it to the top.

802
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:19,056
Stand by.

803
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,061
Stand by.

804
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,835
If you're waiting for
the big finale, I'm sorry.

805
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:49,720
This is all I do.

806
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,474
Oh, son of a...!

807
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,342
Mr. Eckland.

808
00:39:55,342 --> 00:39:57,845
(girls laughing)

809
00:39:57,845 --> 00:39:59,096
I'm bleeding.

810
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:16,614
Mr. Eckland, we could all
do with some food.

811
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:24,088
Elizabeth, you and Harry
open some tins.

812
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:28,459
And Christine and Jenny, find
the knives, forks and napkins.

813
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,961
That'll be
a good trick-- napkins.

814
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:33,464
(speaking French)

815
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:36,600
Both:
Oui, Mademoiselle.

816
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,218
Hey, what are...

817
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,103
Be careful.

818
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,354
What are you doing with those?

819
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,605
(speaking French)

820
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,108
Mr. Eckland, where
are your tea things?

821
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,359
My what?

822
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:45,976
Your tea things.

823
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,228
Last time I looked

824
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,364
they were next
to the finger bowls.

825
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,233
Hey, hey, be
careful with that!

826
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:53,484
Didn't I tell
you that...?

827
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:54,735
Oh, it's an empty.

828
00:40:54,735 --> 00:40:56,620
Houghton:
Are you standing by, Walter?

829
00:40:57,238 --> 00:40:57,872
All set to go, Frank.

830
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,740
What did you work out?

831
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,625
A parachute drop.

832
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,243
A what?

833
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,128
They've got to be
picked up, Frank

834
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,379
not put down.

835
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,248
We thought you could do
with more provisions

836
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,133
what with all
those extra mouths.

837
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,001
I want their mouths out of here.

838
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,887
When are you
coming for them?

839
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,755
Well, that's rather
difficult to say.

840
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,640
Well, try saying today.

841
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,143
I don't think
it'll be today, Walter.

842
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,263
Well, what's making that
parachute drop, a seagull?

843
00:41:22,263 --> 00:41:24,765
We can only manage a night drop.

844
00:41:24,765 --> 00:41:26,016
There's no way to land.

845
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,902
Frank, you still haven't said

846
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,404
when you're going
to get them off.

847
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,655
No, I haven't, have I?

848
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,524
Two or three weeks.

849
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:34,775
Two or three...

850
00:41:34,775 --> 00:41:35,409
Four.

851
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:36,660
Four?

852
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,912
With luck.

853
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,780
We'll have to stay
here a month?

854
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,665
I don't want
to stay here.

855
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:46,036
Well, Frank, you've slipped it
to me again, haven't you?

856
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:48,539
I'm sorry, Walter,
there's a war on.

857
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:49,790
Oh, stop saying that.

858
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,041
Commander, would
you be so kind

859
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,927
as to contact
my father in Rabaul

860
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,795
and have him inform
the parents of the girls

861
00:41:54,795 --> 00:41:56,013
that they're quite safe?

862
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,882
All civilian personnel
are being evacuated

863
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,767
from New Britain, Miss Freneau.

864
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,635
But I'll see to it
that they're informed.

865
00:42:01,635 --> 00:42:04,772
Signing off.

866
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:06,640
Three or four weeks.

867
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,777
I heard it.
I heard that.

868
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,531
Mr. Eckland, may I
speak with you

869
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,782
outside for a moment?

870
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:16,033
Some other time.

871
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,284
I've been up all night.

872
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,536
I'm going to bed.

873
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,158
Girls, go outside and play.

874
00:42:24,158 --> 00:42:26,043
But stay close
to the house.

875
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,546
Yeah, tell them
to stay off the beach

876
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,797
or out
in the open.

877
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:32,917
Mr. Eckland.

878
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,168
Yes, sir.

879
00:42:34,168 --> 00:42:35,419
It now appears likely

880
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:38,556
we'll remain here together
for some time to come.

881
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,807
Mm-hmm.

882
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,058
This being the case

883
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,927
I think it would be
wise of us

884
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:45,429
to arrive at
an understanding.

885
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,314
It must be
quite clear to you

886
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:50,434
that the children must be
our first consideration.

887
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:52,319
Your first
consideration.

888
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,188
I'm my first
consideration.

889
00:42:54,188 --> 00:42:55,439
They are young...

890
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:56,690
Look out.

891
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:57,942
...sensitive
and impressionable.

892
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,193
So am I.

893
00:42:59,193 --> 00:43:01,695
They've been through
a most trying experience

894
00:43:01,695 --> 00:43:04,198
and they will need a normal,
orderly routine established

895
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,700
and I would expect you
to do your share.

896
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,952
Oh, sure, sure.

897
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:09,837
It was quite one thing
for you to live

898
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,705
as you did when you were
alone on this island

899
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,591
but you are no longer alone

900
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,459
and your behavior is
totally unsuitable.

901
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,962
Your language is common

902
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:20,464
your eating habits
revolting.

903
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:21,715
Oh, yes?

904
00:43:21,715 --> 00:43:22,967
Your appearance disgraceful

905
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:26,103
and as for your drinking,
that must stop immediately.

906
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,606
I will not have the children
subjected to it.

907
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,857
You are, after all

908
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,359
the only man with whom
they'll come in contact.

909
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,228
That makes you
the father figure.

910
00:43:34,228 --> 00:43:36,113
Are you finished?

911
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,364
Yes.

912
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:37,982
Good.

913
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,233
Let me tell you something.

914
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:40,484
I am not a father figure.

915
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:41,735
I am not an uncle figure

916
00:43:41,735 --> 00:43:44,238
or a brother figure
or a cousin figure.

917
00:43:44,238 --> 00:43:47,374
In fact, that only figure
I intend being

918
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,877
is a total stranger figure.

919
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:54,248
So now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to bed.

920
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,002
I'm now supposed
to cover my eyes

921
00:43:58,002 --> 00:43:59,887
and run screaming
from the room?

922
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,138
You'll be disappointed.

923
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,389
Isn't she a pip?

924
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,892
I doubt very much anything
you could do would shock me.

925
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,394
Let me repeat: My only concern
is for the children.

926
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,646
Well, why
don't you

927
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,514
go and concern
yourself with them

928
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:11,765
and let me get some sleep.

929
00:44:11,765 --> 00:44:14,902
Gladly, as soon as you've
told me where we will stay.

930
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,153
Stay anywhere you like.

931
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,022
Well, as this hovel
seems to be

932
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,907
the only shelter
on the island

933
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,775
it's obvious we will
have to stay here.

934
00:44:21,775 --> 00:44:23,661
You know what
fat chance means?

935
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,912
This is my hovel

936
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:28,032
so why don't you back out
and let me get some sleep.

937
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,037
Very well.

938
00:44:39,293 --> 00:44:41,178
(sighing)

939
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,047
(grunts)

940
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:46,800
Oh, for...

941
00:44:59,279 --> 00:44:59,897
(loud pounding and clattering)

942
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,399
What... what... what...

943
00:45:16,163 --> 00:45:17,414
(screaming in French)

944
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:31,812
Lady, you are making
a powerful enemy.

945
00:45:38,685 --> 00:45:41,188
Girls, let's get in.

946
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,999
(engines droning)

947
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,354
(humming jaunty tune)

948
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,495
(whistling)

949
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:51,635
(girls screaming)

950
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,389
You ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.

951
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:58,525
A gentleman simply
does not enter a room

952
00:47:58,525 --> 00:48:00,394
where ladies
are not decent.

953
00:48:00,394 --> 00:48:02,896
Well, you learn
something every day.

954
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,786
I have to use the radio! It...

955
00:48:10,404 --> 00:48:11,038
Freneau:
All right,
Mr. Eckland.

956
00:48:11,038 --> 00:48:12,289
You may come in now.

957
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:13,540
Oh.

958
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:37,931
Didn't you want
to use the radio?

959
00:48:37,931 --> 00:48:39,816
Uh...

960
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:41,068
Yes, radio.

961
00:48:41,068 --> 00:48:43,570
Yes... what's it doing
over here?

962
00:48:46,073 --> 00:48:47,941
King's point,
this is Eckland.

963
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:49,826
Six Mitsu 104s heading east
at 10,000.

964
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,695
Message received, Mother Goose.

965
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:54,197
Message received.

966
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,595
Are you looking for something,
Mr. Eckland?

967
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,217
I asked you
to stop drinking

968
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:17,971
but you wouldn't.

969
00:49:17,971 --> 00:49:19,222
Oh, no.

970
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:21,108
Where is it?

971
00:49:21,108 --> 00:49:22,976
Somewhere where you won't
find it.

972
00:49:22,976 --> 00:49:26,113
Gone again.

973
00:49:26,113 --> 00:49:29,866
Of all
the meddlesome... Oh!

974
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:30,484
Come on, now,
where is it?

975
00:49:30,484 --> 00:49:31,735
You got it up here?

976
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:32,986
(groaning)

977
00:49:32,986 --> 00:49:34,237
Wait!

978
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:36,123
Oh, you wait!
You just wait!

979
00:49:37,991 --> 00:49:40,494
King's point, this
is Eckland again.

980
00:49:40,494 --> 00:49:41,745
Hello, Mother Goose.

981
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:42,996
This is Briar Patch.

982
00:49:42,996 --> 00:49:44,247
Get Houghton,
on the double.

983
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,750
Big Bad Wolf
is engaged.

984
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,001
I don't care if he's married.

985
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:48,635
You get him!

986
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:49,886
You know, lady

987
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:51,138
you missed
your calling.

988
00:49:51,138 --> 00:49:52,389
You ought to carry
a tambourine

989
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:53,640
and put fig leaves
on statues.

990
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,891
Houghton:
What is it, Walter?

991
00:49:55,509 --> 00:49:56,760
Frank, now, this
is a military zone

992
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,645
and you're in command.

993
00:49:58,645 --> 00:50:01,148
You tell Miss Goody Two-Shoes
here to get off my back.

994
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:01,765
Goody Two-Shoes?

995
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,016
Yes, you tell her!

996
00:50:03,016 --> 00:50:04,267
Tell her she's a pain in the...

997
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,153
Uh, please, Walter, be civil.

998
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:07,404
Civil?

999
00:50:07,404 --> 00:50:09,272
Who pushed who out
of whose home?

1000
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:11,158
Who stole whose liquor?

1001
00:50:11,158 --> 00:50:13,026
Who bit whose hand? Twice.

1002
00:50:13,026 --> 00:50:14,277
She bit you?

1003
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:14,911
Yes.

1004
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,163
Miss Freneau?

1005
00:50:16,163 --> 00:50:17,414
No! Now, you tell her...

1006
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:18,665
you tell her to give me
back my booze.

1007
00:50:18,665 --> 00:50:19,916
You tell her to butt out!

1008
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,168
You tell her...

1009
00:50:21,168 --> 00:50:21,785
All right, Walter,
I'll speak to her.

1010
00:50:23,036 --> 00:50:24,287
Yeah, here.

1011
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:25,539
Yes?

1012
00:50:25,539 --> 00:50:28,041
Miss Freneau, I'm sure
you've noticed

1013
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:32,429
that Mr. Eckland is not
the most sociable sportsman...

1014
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,931
Mr. Eckland is a rude,
foul-mouthed

1015
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:36,800
drunken, filthy beast.

1016
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,051
Well, be that as it may...

1017
00:50:38,051 --> 00:50:39,302
This is the filthy
beast speaking.

1018
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:40,554
Now, listen, Frank

1019
00:50:40,554 --> 00:50:41,188
when you send
those supplies

1020
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:42,439
send plenty of whiskey.
Plenty...

1021
00:50:43,056 --> 00:50:44,941
I insist you do nothing
of the kind, Commander.

1022
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:47,444
Now be quiet,
both of you.

1023
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:49,946
We've arranged
for the parachute drop

1024
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:51,198
to take place
tomorrow night at 2200.

1025
00:50:51,198 --> 00:50:53,700
I suggest, therefore,
if you want anything at all

1026
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,203
you better give me a list
of your needs.

1027
00:50:56,203 --> 00:50:57,454
Whiskey!

1028
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:58,705
Yes, we know about you.

1029
00:50:58,705 --> 00:50:59,956
What about Miss Freneau
and the girls?

1030
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:00,574
Girl 1:
Formal clothes!

1031
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:02,459
Magazines!
Peppermint drops.

1032
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,294
Glass of chocolate!
(speaking French)

1033
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:05,545
Tennis clothes!

1034
00:51:05,545 --> 00:51:06,163
Bow and arrow!

1035
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:07,414
Girls, please!

1036
00:51:07,414 --> 00:51:09,299
I have prepared
a list.

1037
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:11,802
Now, hold it.

1038
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:13,670
You've taken over
everything else

1039
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,173
but the radio is still
my responsibility.

1040
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:19,926
Eight nighties.

1041
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:27,434
Would you repeat that, Walter?

1042
00:51:27,434 --> 00:51:29,936
Mr. Eckland
isn't here anymore, Commander.

1043
00:51:29,936 --> 00:51:31,188
I'll give you the list.

1044
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:32,439
Eight nighties.

1045
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:35,575
Nighties?

1046
00:51:35,575 --> 00:51:38,078
That is correct,
in various sizes

1047
00:51:38,078 --> 00:51:39,329
starting
with children's size six.

1048
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:41,832
And would you please make
that one a bunny suit?

1049
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,700
A what?

1050
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,951
A bunny suit.

1051
00:51:44,951 --> 00:51:46,203
I'm sure you've seen them,
Commander.

1052
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:48,705
You know, with the hands
and feet.

1053
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:53,710
With... the hands and feet.

1054
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:00,300
Mother Goose!

1055
00:52:05,305 --> 00:52:06,556
Monsieur Eckland?

1056
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:09,059
Big Bad Wolf is calling you
on the wireless.

1057
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,310
Oh.

1058
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:12,179
Don't touch anything.

1059
00:52:12,179 --> 00:52:14,681
In fact, you better get off
the boat.

1060
00:52:25,325 --> 00:52:28,445
Get a shirt
and his pants.

1061
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:34,084
Oh, look at this!

1062
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:35,952
Oh, look.

1063
00:52:37,204 --> 00:52:38,455
Good morning.

1064
00:52:39,706 --> 00:52:42,209
Uh, I'm wanted
on the radio.

1065
00:52:42,209 --> 00:52:43,460
Uh...

1066
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,962
Oh... oh...

1067
00:52:52,853 --> 00:52:55,355
Hey, King's Point,
this is Eckland.

1068
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:57,858
Come in, Mother Goose.

1069
00:52:57,858 --> 00:53:00,977
This is Briar Patch.

1070
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:02,863
Well, you had
something to tell me.

1071
00:53:02,863 --> 00:53:04,731
Big Bad Wolf had a message
for you

1072
00:53:04,731 --> 00:53:05,982
concerning the parachute drop.

1073
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:07,868
Gave it to Goody Two-Shoes.

1074
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:12,873
Oh, the...

1075
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:14,741
Um, Commander Houghton
couldn't wait.

1076
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:16,626
He asked me
to give you the message.

1077
00:53:24,134 --> 00:53:25,385
Well?

1078
00:53:25,385 --> 00:53:26,002
Well, what?

1079
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:27,254
The message.

1080
00:53:27,254 --> 00:53:29,139
What message?

1081
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:31,007
The message message.

1082
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:34,144
Oh, oh-- that message.

1083
00:53:34,761 --> 00:53:36,646
Oh, I wrote it down
for you.

1084
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:43,520
That's in French.

1085
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,771
Oh, is it?

1086
00:53:44,771 --> 00:53:47,274
Oh, so it is.

1087
00:53:47,274 --> 00:53:49,159
Read it, please.

1088
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,027
(speaking French)

1089
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:53,530
No, no, no, no.

1090
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,415
You're reading it
in French.

1091
00:53:55,415 --> 00:53:57,284
Well, it's written
in French.

1092
00:53:57,284 --> 00:53:59,786
Oh... translate it.

1093
00:53:59,786 --> 00:54:02,289
Oh, you want it
in English.

1094
00:54:02,289 --> 00:54:04,791
Um, Commander Houghton says

1095
00:54:04,791 --> 00:54:08,545
there's too much enemy activity
in the area to chance a...

1096
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:11,681
How do you say,
in English, "parachute"?

1097
00:54:15,435 --> 00:54:16,686
Parachute.

1098
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:18,555
Oh, really? Oh.

1099
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:20,440
There's too much enemy activity

1100
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,309
in the area to chance
a parachute drop

1101
00:54:22,309 --> 00:54:26,062
and he asks us to make do
with the supplies we have.

1102
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:27,314
Oh, no.

1103
00:54:27,314 --> 00:54:27,948
Mr. Eckland?

1104
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:29,816
What?

1105
00:54:29,816 --> 00:54:33,570
I don't suppose there's any use
my asking your permission

1106
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,706
to share certain of your
personal belongings with us?

1107
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:39,826
Well, so far, you've "shared" me
out of my home, my bed, my food

1108
00:54:39,826 --> 00:54:41,077
and my shirt.

1109
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,580
Now, how about
sharing some of
my things with me?

1110
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,831
Would you like some tea?

1111
00:54:44,831 --> 00:54:46,082
Tea?

1112
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:47,334
Lemon or milk?

1113
00:54:47,334 --> 00:54:48,585
Milk?

1114
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:49,219
Oh, sorry.

1115
00:54:49,836 --> 00:54:50,470
We're out of milk.

1116
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:51,721
Oh...

1117
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,590
But we could use
some additional
place settings

1118
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:56,092
some rope...
some, uh, tools

1119
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:58,561
and above all,
a change of clothing.

1120
00:54:59,179 --> 00:55:01,064
Above all, I could use
some whiskey.

1121
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:02,932
Now, how about making
a trade?

1122
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:05,435
Sorry. That I can't do.

1123
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,937
Then, Madam, I wish you
a good day.

1124
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:09,189
Mr. Eckland,
wait!

1125
00:55:09,189 --> 00:55:10,440
Hello,
Mr. Eckland.

1126
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,691
The answer is "no."

1127
00:55:11,691 --> 00:55:12,942
Bonjour, Monsieur.

1128
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:14,194
(speaking French)

1129
00:55:14,194 --> 00:55:16,079
I wouldn't think of it.

1130
00:55:16,696 --> 00:55:17,330
Oh!

1131
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:19,833
You stepped
on my foot!

1132
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:20,450
You put it under mine!

1133
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,701
Look out!

1134
00:55:21,701 --> 00:55:23,586
All a bunch of nuts.

1135
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:29,209
Oh, now hold it.

1136
00:55:29,843 --> 00:55:31,711
And what have
you got there?

1137
00:55:31,711 --> 00:55:32,345
(screams)

1138
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:34,214
Oh, no!

1139
00:55:34,214 --> 00:55:35,465
Oh, no. Ow!

1140
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:39,219
Come back here,
you pirate.

1141
00:55:39,219 --> 00:55:41,721
Mr. Eckland,
stop chasing the girls.

1142
00:55:41,721 --> 00:55:42,972
I'm not chasing...

1143
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:44,224
They're all crooks!

1144
00:55:44,224 --> 00:55:45,475
And you're the crookiest.

1145
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:48,611
And a good day to you,
Mr. Eckland.

1146
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:23,596
Rumplestiltzkin,
Rumplestiltzkin.

1147
00:56:23,596 --> 00:56:27,350
Can anyone hear me?

1148
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:30,487
Houghton:
I can hear you, Rumplestiltzkin.

1149
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,355
I can hear you, too.

1150
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:33,606
Where's Mr. Eckland?

1151
00:56:33,606 --> 00:56:34,858
He's not here.

1152
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:37,994
Nobody's here
except my friend Gretchen.

1153
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:40,497
We're not well today.

1154
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,365
Say "hello," Gretchen.

1155
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:46,753
Did you hear Gretchen?

1156
00:56:46,753 --> 00:56:48,004
She said, "hello."

1157
00:56:48,621 --> 00:56:49,255
Hello, Gretchen.

1158
00:56:49,255 --> 00:56:51,124
I'm sorry you're not well today.

1159
00:56:51,124 --> 00:56:53,009
Go and get Mr. Eckland, please.

1160
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,878
The filthy beast?

1161
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:56,763
Oh, we don't speak
to him.

1162
00:56:56,763 --> 00:56:58,014
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1163
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:59,265
Come on!

1164
00:56:59,265 --> 00:57:00,517
Get away from there.

1165
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:01,768
Come along, Gretchen.

1166
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:03,019
That you, Walter?

1167
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,270
No, it's Gretchen.

1168
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:06,773
Keep them away from that radio,
will you?

1169
00:57:06,773 --> 00:57:09,275
You keep them away
from the radio.

1170
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:16,149
Beat it.

1171
00:57:16,149 --> 00:57:19,903
Miss Freneau told us to stay
in the house.

1172
00:57:46,446 --> 00:57:47,697
Ah.

1173
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,085
(chuckles softly)

1174
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:35,662
?
After breakfast, may w
e go out with the others

1175
00:58:35,662 --> 00:58:38,164
Nope. Not until
you're feeling better.

1176
00:58:38,164 --> 00:58:40,049
It's Gretchen
that's not well.

1177
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,918
e.
I'm tired of staying her

1178
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,803
Oh, you stop complaining.

1179
00:58:43,803 --> 00:58:45,672
You sound like Anne.

1180
00:58:48,808 --> 00:58:50,059
Is anything wrong?

1181
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:52,562
The whole Japanese navy's
anchored offshore.

1182
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:53,813
They're sending a boat in.

1183
00:58:53,813 --> 00:58:55,064
Where are
the other children?

1184
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:56,933
Uh, they're...
Come on,
let's round them up.

1185
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,818
Let's get them
in the shack.

1186
00:59:00,687 --> 00:59:01,938
Oh, Mr. Eckland...

1187
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:04,440
shouldn't we report the Japanese
to Commander Houghton?

1188
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,194
In five minutes he can
talk to them personally.

1189
00:59:08,194 --> 00:59:10,079
You and Gretchen
stay in the house.

1190
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:20,707
Come on, hurry it up.

1191
00:59:20,707 --> 00:59:21,958
Get in the house.

1192
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,843
(speaking French)

1193
00:59:23,843 --> 00:59:25,094
Oui, mademoiselle.

1194
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:30,717
Quickly.
Where are the other two?

1195
00:59:30,717 --> 00:59:32,602
They're down
on the beach
collecting coconuts.

1196
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:33,853
I told you to keep them
off the beach.

1197
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:35,104
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did

1198
00:59:35,722 --> 00:59:36,973
but you weren't listening,
as usual.

1199
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:38,858
Come and show me.
Come on, let's go.

1200
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:43,863
Show me where.

1201
00:59:43,863 --> 00:59:45,114
Anne's up in one
of those trees.

1202
00:59:45,732 --> 00:59:47,617
Uh-huh. Get down.

1203
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:50,119
Stay here. Don't move.

1204
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,482
Hey, stay. Shh.

1205
01:00:25,104 --> 01:00:26,990
(speaking Japanese)

1206
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:31,995
(speaking Japanese)

1207
01:01:08,281 --> 01:01:10,149
If she opens her
mouth, we've had it.

1208
01:01:10,149 --> 01:01:10,783
Jenny hasn't said a word

1209
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,286
since she left her parents
seven days ago.

1210
01:01:13,286 --> 01:01:14,537
I thought you
might have noticed.

1211
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:17,040
She can still scre
am, can't she?

1212
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:22,045
Here.

1213
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,918
(grunting quietly)

1214
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:57,080
Shh, shh, shh.
(crying quietly)

1215
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,582
Baby, shh, baby,
shh, don't cry.

1216
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:02,085
Shh, don't cry,
don't cry.
(crying softly)

1217
01:02:10,843 --> 01:02:13,346
(speaking Japanese)

1218
01:02:18,351 --> 01:02:20,853
(continue speaking Japanese)

1219
01:02:22,722 --> 01:02:25,224
I wish I knew what
they were saying.
Shh.

1220
01:02:25,224 --> 01:02:27,727
The one with the glasses
is the cook.

1221
01:02:27,727 --> 01:02:29,612
Their captain
adores turtle soup.

1222
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:31,481
Hmm?

1223
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:33,983
He sent them ashore
for turtles.

1224
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,868
There doesn't seem
to be any.

1225
01:02:35,868 --> 01:02:38,988
Oh, it's all right--
they're going to leave now.

1226
01:02:42,742 --> 01:02:45,878
(men speaking Japanese)

1227
01:02:45,878 --> 01:02:47,747
Oh, dear.

1228
01:02:47,747 --> 01:02:48,998
What?

1229
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:52,752
One of them suggested they
bring back coconuts instead.

1230
01:02:52,752 --> 01:02:54,637
It's a bad dream.

1231
01:02:55,254 --> 01:02:57,140
(speaking Japanese)

1232
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:00,259
The cook said the
captain wants turtle
soup or nothing.

1233
01:03:00,259 --> 01:03:02,145
s.
He's sick of coconut

1234
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:04,013
Good for him.

1235
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:06,516
Oh...
What?

1236
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:10,269
g.
He just called the
captain a dirty na
me, and they're leavin

1237
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:18,411
Anne (whispering):
Help...

1238
01:03:18,411 --> 01:03:19,662
I'm slipping.

1239
01:03:25,918 --> 01:03:26,536
(Eckland grunts)

1240
01:03:30,289 --> 01:03:31,541
Quick, let's go.

1241
01:03:45,671 --> 01:03:48,174
Oh, go on, beat it.
Come on. Buzz off.

1242
01:03:48,174 --> 01:03:50,059
You're not supposed
to be on the boat.

1243
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:51,928
Get off the boat.

1244
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:05,074
(clears throat)

1245
01:04:08,828 --> 01:04:10,079
Thank you.

1246
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:15,084
(clears throat)

1247
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:16,335
Thank you.

1248
01:04:18,204 --> 01:04:19,455
Hey, what's your name?

1249
01:04:20,706 --> 01:04:24,460
You've got a name,
haven't you?

1250
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:28,848
Oh.

1251
01:04:30,716 --> 01:04:31,968
See this whistle?

1252
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:34,470
Would you like
to have it?

1253
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:35,721
Okay.

1254
01:04:36,355 --> 01:04:36,973
Now, all you have to do

1255
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:38,858
is repeat three simple words
after me.

1256
01:04:38,858 --> 01:04:41,360
Is that a deal?

1257
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,229
Just repeat three words.

1258
01:04:43,229 --> 01:04:45,114
All right.

1259
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:46,365
Elephant.

1260
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:51,370
Elephant.

1261
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:53,873
Rhinoceros.

1262
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:56,375
Rhinoceros.

1263
01:04:56,375 --> 01:04:56,993
Wrong.

1264
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:58,244
Why?

1265
01:04:58,244 --> 01:04:59,495
No, not "why"-- "wrong."

1266
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:00,746
"Wrong" is the third word.

1267
01:05:00,746 --> 01:05:01,998
You lose.

1268
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:05,134
No! Give me that back.

1269
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:08,254
Oh, I didn't think
you'd be a sore loser. Here.

1270
01:05:10,756 --> 01:05:12,008
All right.

1271
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:19,515
(whistle blowing)

1272
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:22,018
I'm sorry. We're
all out of whistles.

1273
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:23,903
I told Harry she
could help us.

1274
01:05:23,903 --> 01:05:25,771
Help us do what?

1275
01:05:25,771 --> 01:05:27,023
Fix your boat.

1276
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:29,525
Harry knows everythi
ng about boats.

1277
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:32,028
Uh-huh. Well, how'd you like
to swab down the deck?

1278
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:34,530
Smashing! I'd love to!

1279
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,415
Good. You'll find a mop
down below.

1280
01:05:36,415 --> 01:05:37,667
Go ahead.

1281
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:43,923
lo.
Oh, hello, hel

1282
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:48,928
(both speaking French)

1283
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:53,299
Oh, uh-huh. Well, you do that.

1284
01:05:53,299 --> 01:05:54,550
Yeah. Do that. Mm-hmm.

1285
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,435
But do it quietly.

1286
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:13,619
Mr. Eckland?

1287
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:14,870
Quiet, quiet.

1288
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:17,373
Do you want me
to mess this up?

1289
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:21,127
Mr. Eckland?

1290
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:23,629
Now, I know you've
saved up a lot to say

1291
01:06:23,629 --> 01:06:26,749
but would you mind
spreading it out a little?

1292
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:28,000
g.
You're doing it wron

1293
01:06:28,634 --> 01:06:29,885
.
It's backwards

1294
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:31,137
No, it isn't.

1295
01:06:31,137 --> 01:06:33,005
See the boat's upside down.

1296
01:06:33,005 --> 01:06:36,142
You do it this way so when
you turn it over you...

1297
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:41,764
Well... how can I
get anything done

1298
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:43,649
when you're chattering
all the time?

1299
01:06:43,649 --> 01:06:46,152
Besides, you should be
working. Come on.

1300
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:54,276
It can't be.

1301
01:07:01,167 --> 01:07:03,035
(quietly):
Red light!

1302
01:07:10,543 --> 01:07:13,045
So this is where you are.

1303
01:07:13,045 --> 01:07:16,182
?
What are you
all doing here

1304
01:07:16,182 --> 01:07:18,050
s.
Look at their clothe

1305
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:19,301
They'remyclothes.

1306
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:20,553
But they're filthy.

1307
01:07:21,187 --> 01:07:23,055
No. They're dirty.I'mfilthy.

1308
01:07:23,055 --> 01:07:24,306
e.
All of you, get
back to the hous

1309
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:26,192
ns.
It's nearly ti
me for your lesso

1310
01:07:26,192 --> 01:07:28,694
Mr. Eckland asked us
to help fix his boat.

1311
01:07:28,694 --> 01:07:30,563
Well, I'm sure he
will excuse you now.

1312
01:07:30,563 --> 01:07:32,448
re.
But we wan
t to stay he

1313
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:33,699
I don't...

1314
01:07:35,568 --> 01:07:36,819
What did you say, Jenny?

1315
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:39,321
We want to stay here.

1316
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:41,207
Mr. Eckland
got her to speak.

1317
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:44,960
I created a monster--
a talking person.

1318
01:07:45,578 --> 01:07:46,829
(chuckles softly)

1319
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:48,714
Well, better do as she said.

1320
01:07:48,714 --> 01:07:49,965
Get goin
g.

1321
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:58,090
Thank you, Mr. Eckland.

1322
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:00,593
Next time I want them
to talk or doanything

1323
01:08:00,593 --> 01:08:01,844
I'll call you.

1324
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:03,095
t
Well, it's not my faul

1325
01:08:03,095 --> 01:08:05,598
that boats are mor
e fun than lessons.

1326
01:08:10,603 --> 01:08:13,105
I did it on purpose.

1327
01:08:15,608 --> 01:08:18,110
Nothingis ever your
 fault, Mr. Eckland...

1328
01:08:18,744 --> 01:08:20,613
and if I return
seven wild Indians

1329
01:08:20,613 --> 01:08:22,498
to their families
who trusted me

1330
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:25,618
well, then that won't
be your fault, either.

1331
01:08:26,252 --> 01:08:27,503
h.
Shh, shh, sh

1332
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:29,371
Huh?

1333
01:08:30,623 --> 01:08:33,125
(whispering):
Well, you don't have to be

1334
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:34,376
a schoolteacher all the time.

1335
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:36,879
(whispering):
I am not a schoolteacher...

1336
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:39,348
but some form of discipline
has to be maintained.

1337
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:43,102
Shh...

1338
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:46,856
Why don't you teach them
something useful?

1339
01:08:48,107 --> 01:08:51,227
What do you suggest,
drinking and swearing?

1340
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:53,729
(loudly):
Why are we whispering?

1341
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:54,980
Oh!

1342
01:08:59,985 --> 01:09:02,488
?
I don't know. Why 
are we whispering? Hmm

1343
01:09:02,488 --> 01:09:04,373
Is it edible?

1344
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:06,242
ly.
No. I get lone

1345
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,744
--
Now, why don't you teach
them something like that

1346
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:10,629
something practical,
like catching fish?

1347
01:09:10,629 --> 01:09:13,132
Oh, well, that doesn't
seem too difficult.

1348
01:09:13,132 --> 01:09:15,634
I mean, if you can do it,
I'm sure anyone can.

1349
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:18,754
et.
Try it. I haven't 
had my morning laugh y

1350
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:20,639
All right.

1351
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:41,277
Oh, that was good. Good.

1352
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:50,669
Whoa!

1353
01:09:50,669 --> 01:09:51,921
(spluttering)

1354
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:53,789
I didn't quite understand

1355
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:55,674
the reason
for that last movement.

1356
01:09:55,674 --> 01:09:58,177
Would you mind
demonstrating
it again?

1357
01:10:02,548 --> 01:10:06,302
I have an infuriating lack of
talent for doing simple things.

1358
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,804
You probably don't
do them right. That's why.

1359
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:11,941
All right, all right,
just stay there.

1360
01:10:13,192 --> 01:10:16,312
I like fish,
but fish don't like me.

1361
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:17,563
...
All right, now

1362
01:10:18,197 --> 01:10:20,699
Now, be quiet.
Just keep still.

1363
01:10:20,699 --> 01:10:22,568
Now, give me your hand.

1364
01:10:22,568 --> 01:10:24,453
Cup them, cup them.

1365
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:26,322
That's right.
Oh.

1366
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:27,573
See?
Mm-hmm.

1367
01:10:27,573 --> 01:10:29,458
Now, watch
what you're doing.

1368
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:30,709
Hey, here she comes again.

1369
01:10:30,709 --> 01:10:32,578
?
How do you know it's a she

1370
01:10:32,578 --> 01:10:35,080
Her mouth is open.
Now, be quiet.

1371
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:39,468
Okay, now... now, slowly...

1372
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:40,719
Slowly now...

1373
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:44,473
Slowly... s... s...

1374
01:10:45,724 --> 01:10:50,729
w?
Mr. Eckland, aren't 
we moving too slowly no

1375
01:10:50,729 --> 01:10:52,598
Hmm? Hmm?

1376
01:10:55,734 --> 01:10:57,603
Shouldn't we...

1377
01:10:57,603 --> 01:10:59,488
Shouldn't we what?

1378
01:11:00,105 --> 01:11:00,739
What?

1379
01:11:01,357 --> 01:11:04,443
You said "shouldn't we."

1380
01:11:04,443 --> 01:11:06,328
Shouldn't we what?

1381
01:11:12,584 --> 01:11:15,087
Well, you've got
the hang of it now.

1382
01:11:15,087 --> 01:11:16,956
Oh... we-we didn
't catch a fish.

1383
01:11:16,956 --> 01:11:19,458
I know, I know.
That's right, that's right.

1384
01:11:19,458 --> 01:11:20,092
W-we didn't.

1385
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:21,961
But you got the hang of it.

1386
01:11:21,961 --> 01:11:23,212
t.
You already said tha

1387
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:24,463
Oh, I did, huh.

1388
01:11:24,463 --> 01:11:26,348
Mr. Eckland, are you
going to show me

1389
01:11:26,966 --> 01:11:28,851
how to catch a fis
h or aren't you?

1390
01:11:29,468 --> 01:11:31,971
I aren't.

1391
01:11:45,084 --> 01:11:46,852
I want to go back now.

1392
01:11:46,852 --> 01:11:49,989
Mmm, just as soon as I pick
some of those berries.

1393
01:11:49,989 --> 01:11:51,857
What if they're dangerous?

1394
01:11:52,491 --> 01:11:54,994
Oh, we can always
ask Mr. Eckland.

1395
01:11:54,994 --> 01:11:57,496
Yeah, if he says, "Eat them,"
we'llknowthey're poisonous.

1396
01:11:57,496 --> 01:11:58,747
Oh.

1397
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:00,616
Oh!

1398
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,501
Oh, something bit me.

1399
01:12:02,501 --> 01:12:03,752
A snake--

1400
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:05,621
there,
next to your leg.

1401
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:06,872
Oh!

1402
01:12:06,872 --> 01:12:08,123
It bit you!
It bit you!

1403
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:10,626
Oh, l-let's go
back quickly.

1404
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:20,469
(speaking French
 excitedly)

1405
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:21,720
Mm-hmm.

1406
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:22,971
(continuing French)

1407
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,309
What happened?

1408
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:28,560
I don't know
what she's saying.

1409
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,446
A snake...
It was a long snake.

1410
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:31,063
I saw it.

1411
01:12:31,063 --> 01:12:32,314
It bit mademoiselle

1412
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:33,565
on the leg.

1413
01:12:33,565 --> 01:12:34,817
Okay, everyone out.

1414
01:12:37,953 --> 01:12:40,456
Freneau:
Girls, do as Mr. Eckland says.

1415
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:41,707
I'll be all right.

1416
01:12:41,707 --> 01:12:43,575
Harriet:
I want to watch.

1417
01:12:43,575 --> 01:12:45,461
Oh, Harriet, please.

1418
01:12:46,712 --> 01:12:47,963
Go on.

1419
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:53,585
(gasps)

1420
01:12:53,585 --> 01:12:54,837
Is it painful?

1421
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:56,088
Your hand is wet.

1422
01:12:56,088 --> 01:12:57,339
Yeah.

1423
01:12:57,339 --> 01:12:59,224
Now, this is going
to hurt a little.

1424
01:12:59,224 --> 01:13:00,476
You should enjoy that.

1425
01:13:01,093 --> 01:13:01,727
Quiet.

1426
01:13:04,229 --> 01:13:06,732
Go ahead, you can yell
if you feel like it.

1427
01:13:06,732 --> 01:13:09,234
I don't feel like it.

1428
01:13:09,234 --> 01:13:11,103
Okay, it's all done.

1429
01:13:11,737 --> 01:13:13,605
Do you really think
it was poisonous?

1430
01:13:13,605 --> 01:13:16,108
Well, no sense
taking any chances.

1431
01:13:16,108 --> 01:13:16,742
Lie back.

1432
01:13:16,742 --> 01:13:18,610
It isn't going to hurt.

1433
01:13:23,615 --> 01:13:24,249
(spits)

1434
01:13:24,249 --> 01:13:26,118
Mr. Eckland...
I want you to know

1435
01:13:26,118 --> 01:13:29,254
I really appreciate
what you're doing.

1436
01:13:29,254 --> 01:13:30,506
Save it.

1437
01:13:33,625 --> 01:13:34,877
(spits)

1438
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:39,882
Come in, Kings Point.

1439
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:41,133
This is Eckland.

1440
01:13:41,133 --> 01:13:43,018
Stebbins:
Briar Patch

1441
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:44,269
Mother Goose.

1442
01:13:44,269 --> 01:13:44,887
Bo Peep here.

1443
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:46,138
Get Houghton, will you?

1444
01:13:46,138 --> 01:13:47,356
We got trouble here.

1445
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:48,607
What's wrong, Walter?

1446
01:13:48,607 --> 01:13:51,727
What kind of snakes they got
around here, Frank?

1447
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:54,196
Is that a rhetorical
question, I hope?

1448
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:56,698
No, Miss Freneau went
and found one.

1449
01:13:56,698 --> 01:13:57,316
Houghton:
Good grief.

1450
01:13:57,316 --> 01:13:58,567
Is she...?

1451
01:13:58,567 --> 01:13:59,818
She seems all right
at the moment.

1452
01:14:00,452 --> 01:14:01,703
Find out if they're poisonous,
will you, Frank

1453
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:03,572
and if so,
what we can do about it?

1454
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:04,206
Right away.

1455
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:05,457
Oh, and Walter...

1456
01:14:05,457 --> 01:14:07,960
until we get a
positive identification

1457
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,828
don't try and
be a movie hero

1458
01:14:09,828 --> 01:14:11,079
and suck out
the venom.

1459
01:14:19,838 --> 01:14:21,089
(gargling)

1460
01:14:27,346 --> 01:14:29,231
Houghton:
Walter?

1461
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:31,733
Are you there, Walter?

1462
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:32,351
Yeah, I'm here, Frank.

1463
01:14:32,351 --> 01:14:33,602
Shoot.

1464
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,487
Plug in the phones, will you?

1465
01:14:37,356 --> 01:14:37,990
Yeah.

1466
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:39,241
(sniffs)

1467
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:40,492
(clears throat)

1468
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:48,000
(sniffs)

1469
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:50,502
Go ahead.

1470
01:14:50,502 --> 01:14:51,753
It's not good.

1471
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:53,005
I've got Dr. Bigrave here.

1472
01:14:53,005 --> 01:14:55,507
He's checked
with Tropical Medicine.

1473
01:14:55,507 --> 01:14:56,758
I'll put him on.

1474
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:58,627
Mr. Eckland...
(clears throat)

1475
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:00,512
there are three varieties
of serpent

1476
01:15:00,512 --> 01:15:01,763
indigenous
to those islands

1477
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:04,883
and I'm afraid all of them
are extremely poisonous.

1478
01:15:04,883 --> 01:15:06,768
Mmm, well, I opened the wound,
doctor.

1479
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:08,637
I think I got all the venom out.

1480
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:11,139
Well, taken orally,
it can't hurtyou,Mr. Eckland

1481
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:13,642
but if she were bitten,
it's entered her bloodstream.

1482
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:14,276
There's nothing we can do.

1483
01:15:14,893 --> 01:15:15,527
I'm afraid she's bought it.

1484
01:15:15,527 --> 01:15:18,030
Well, there must be some...

1485
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:21,149
The venom is neurological
and attacks the nervous system.

1486
01:15:21,149 --> 01:15:23,035
The end will come suddenly

1487
01:15:23,035 --> 01:15:24,903
preceded by a general
numbing sensation

1488
01:15:24,903 --> 01:15:26,154
and dizziness.

1489
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:28,040
Oh, oh, I see, Doctor.

1490
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,291
I suggest you do everything

1491
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:31,159
to make her as comfortable
as possible

1492
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:32,411
including the liberal use

1493
01:15:32,411 --> 01:15:34,913
of any strong analgesic sedative
you happen to have.

1494
01:15:34,913 --> 01:15:36,798
Well, I don't have anything
like that.

1495
01:15:37,416 --> 01:15:38,050
Nonsense, Wally.

1496
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:39,301
You've been using
one for years.

1497
01:15:39,918 --> 01:15:40,552
No, I haven't.

1498
01:15:40,552 --> 01:15:42,421
Oh, yes, I have, yeah.

1499
01:15:42,421 --> 01:15:45,557
Call me, Walter...
when it's over.

1500
01:15:45,557 --> 01:15:46,808
Good-bye.

1501
01:15:46,808 --> 01:15:48,060
Yeah.

1502
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:55,567
It's bad, isn't it?

1503
01:15:57,436 --> 01:15:58,687
Where's the whisky?

1504
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:00,572
Oh, I knew it.

1505
01:16:00,572 --> 01:16:02,441
I'm going to die
and you're afraid

1506
01:16:02,441 --> 01:16:03,692
I'll take the secret
to my grave.

1507
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:05,577
Whisky is still the best thing
for snakebite.

1508
01:16:05,577 --> 01:16:06,828
Where is it, lady?

1509
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:08,697
Stop calling me "lady."

1510
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:09,948
It sounds so awful.

1511
01:16:09,948 --> 01:16:11,199
It's in the oven.

1512
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,085
It can't be in the oven.

1513
01:16:13,085 --> 01:16:13,702
I looked there.

1514
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:14,953
I know you did.

1515
01:16:14,953 --> 01:16:16,204
Gretchen told me.

1516
01:16:16,204 --> 01:16:19,341
I put it thereafteryou looked.

1517
01:16:30,602 --> 01:16:33,722
Hey, I thought
it was for me.

1518
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:36,858
Just want to make sure
it hadn't gone bad.

1519
01:16:37,476 --> 01:16:38,110
Oh, here.

1520
01:16:39,978 --> 01:16:41,229
Now, come on,
drink that.

1521
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:42,481
That won't hurt you.

1522
01:16:42,481 --> 01:16:43,732
Go on.

1523
01:16:47,486 --> 01:16:48,737
Hey-hey, be careful.

1524
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:51,239
You'll ruin
your amateur standing.

1525
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:53,125
(sighing contentedly)

1526
01:16:53,125 --> 01:16:54,993
I'm French, Mr. Eckland.

1527
01:16:54,993 --> 01:16:57,496
My parents started me
on wine mixed with water

1528
01:16:57,496 --> 01:16:58,747
when I was six...

1529
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:04,386
but I don't believe in
excessive drinking...

1530
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:05,637
Uh-uh.

1531
01:17:07,506 --> 01:17:09,391
Especially in
front of children.

1532
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:10,642
Oh.

1533
01:17:10,642 --> 01:17:13,762
No, the truth is...
when my mother died

1534
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:16,898
I became the
mistress of...

1535
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:20,018
the consulate.

1536
01:17:20,018 --> 01:17:21,269
Oh, oh.

1537
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:23,155
Oh, well...

1538
01:17:23,772 --> 01:17:27,526
I presided over all
the diplomatic dinners.

1539
01:17:27,526 --> 01:17:30,028
We had, uh, martinis
before dinner

1540
01:17:30,028 --> 01:17:31,913
white wine
with the fish

1541
01:17:31,913 --> 01:17:34,416
red wine with
the main course

1542
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:36,284
champagne with
the dessert

1543
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:38,170
cognac with
the coffee

1544
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:40,038
and port
after dinner.

1545
01:17:43,175 --> 01:17:45,043
Sounds great.

1546
01:17:50,482 --> 01:17:52,984
Freneau:
Isn't it getting hot in here?

1547
01:17:53,602 --> 01:17:55,487
Whoo, is it getting hot
in here?

1548
01:17:56,104 --> 01:17:57,989
Isn't it getting hot
in here?

1549
01:17:57,989 --> 01:17:59,858
Darling, you mustn't
move around now.

1550
01:17:59,858 --> 01:18:01,743
Oh...
Now, come on,
just-just...

1551
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:04,246
That's right.
Just lie quietly.

1552
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:06,748
I bet you think
I'm an iceberg.

1553
01:18:13,004 --> 01:18:14,256
Do you know
how old I am?

1554
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:15,507
No.

1555
01:18:15,507 --> 01:18:19,261
The truth is... we've
lived in 11 countries.

1556
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:21,763
I can speak
seven languages.

1557
01:18:21,763 --> 01:18:24,266
I'm excellent at bridge.

1558
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:26,134
I play the cello
very well.

1559
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:28,019
I'm double-jointed

1560
01:18:28,019 --> 01:18:30,522
and I know how
to ride a camel.

1561
01:18:30,522 --> 01:18:33,024
(laughing)

1562
01:18:33,024 --> 01:18:34,276
I was engaged once.

1563
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:35,527
Oh? Oh?

1564
01:18:35,527 --> 01:18:37,396
His name was Cesare
and he worked

1565
01:18:37,396 --> 01:18:39,281
in the Italian
consulate at Fiume.

1566
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:41,149
Do you know
where Fiume is?

1567
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:43,034
Uh, Yugoslavia,
isn't it?

1568
01:18:43,034 --> 01:18:45,537
No, it's in Yugoslavia.

1569
01:18:45,537 --> 01:18:46,788
He called me,
"Carissima"

1570
01:18:47,406 --> 01:18:49,291
and gave me handkerchiefs
with my initials on them.

1571
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:52,411
Oh.
Every time he
wanted to kiss me

1572
01:18:52,411 --> 01:18:54,296
he'd say, "Permesso?"

1573
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:56,798
and, then, afterwards,
he'd say, "Grazie."

1574
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:57,416
You've had enough.

1575
01:18:58,049 --> 01:18:59,301
(laughing wildly)

1576
01:19:00,552 --> 01:19:03,054
(continuing laughing)

1577
01:19:03,054 --> 01:19:06,808
Oh, Cesare would
never have done to
my leg what you did.

1578
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:09,311
No, probably couldn't reach it.

1579
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:13,682
I liked what you
did to my leg--

1580
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:14,933
the last part,
I mean.

1581
01:19:14,933 --> 01:19:16,184
Oh, that.

1582
01:19:16,184 --> 01:19:17,436
Tell me...

1583
01:19:17,436 --> 01:19:18,687
I'd like to know

1584
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:20,572
what did my blood
taste like, hmm?

1585
01:19:20,572 --> 01:19:21,823
Delicious.

1586
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:22,441
Now, come on.

1587
01:19:23,074 --> 01:19:24,943
No, no, no, no, no, no,
I'm being serious.

1588
01:19:24,943 --> 01:19:26,194
What did it taste like?

1589
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:27,446
Well, how would I know?

1590
01:19:27,446 --> 01:19:28,697
I'm not a vampire.

1591
01:19:28,697 --> 01:19:31,833
Oh, oh, oh,
was it salty?

1592
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:34,336
A little salty, yes.

1593
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:35,587
Too salty?

1594
01:19:35,587 --> 01:19:37,456
No, it was just right.

1595
01:19:37,456 --> 01:19:39,341
Oh, no, you thought
it was too salty.

1596
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:40,592
I can tell.

1597
01:19:40,592 --> 01:19:41,209
You didn't like it.

1598
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:43,094
No, no,
I-I liked it, mmm.

1599
01:19:43,094 --> 01:19:43,712
Oh, really?

1600
01:19:43,712 --> 01:19:44,963
Yeah, I liked it.

1601
01:19:44,963 --> 01:19:46,214
You're not just
saying that?

1602
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:47,466
No, great blood.

1603
01:19:47,466 --> 01:19:48,717
Uh, uh, please,
now-now-now

1604
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:49,968
buzz off, will you?

1605
01:19:49,968 --> 01:19:51,853
Uh, Miss Freneau isn't
feeling very well.

1606
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:53,104
Now, come on.

1607
01:20:03,114 --> 01:20:04,983
I'm going to kill
that rotten snake.

1608
01:20:05,617 --> 01:20:06,868
Anne!

1609
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:10,622
Your opinion of me's correct,
you know?

1610
01:20:10,622 --> 01:20:13,124
I'm a... a picture-straightener.

1611
01:20:13,124 --> 01:20:14,993
You're a what?

1612
01:20:14,993 --> 01:20:17,496
A picture-straightener.

1613
01:20:17,496 --> 01:20:18,747
Oh.

1614
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:20,632
When I see a
picture on a wall

1615
01:20:20,632 --> 01:20:23,134
that doesn't hang...
straightly...

1616
01:20:23,134 --> 01:20:24,386
I straighten it.

1617
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:25,637
Oh, you do that? Oh.

1618
01:20:25,637 --> 01:20:28,757
And I brush my teeth every
morning and every night...

1619
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:31,259
Hmm.
and if I don't have
a toothbrush...

1620
01:20:33,144 --> 01:20:34,396
I use my finger.

1621
01:20:34,396 --> 01:20:35,647
Mmm.

1622
01:20:38,149 --> 01:20:40,018
Oh...

1623
01:20:40,018 --> 01:20:41,269
I feel so numb.

1624
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:42,521
"Numb"?

1625
01:20:42,521 --> 01:20:43,772
Where?

1626
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:45,023
Everywhere.

1627
01:20:45,023 --> 01:20:45,657
What does it mean?

1628
01:20:45,657 --> 01:20:46,908
Oh...

1629
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:48,777
Oh, you'd better lie down.

1630
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:49,411
And I'm so cold.

1631
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:50,662
Oh, why am I so cold?

1632
01:20:50,662 --> 01:20:52,531
Well, I...
here we go.

1633
01:20:53,164 --> 01:20:53,782
Oh, I'm dizzy.

1634
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:55,033
Yes.
I'm very dizzy.

1635
01:20:55,033 --> 01:20:56,284
You lie down.

1636
01:20:56,284 --> 01:20:56,918
Just rest.

1637
01:20:56,918 --> 01:20:58,169
(moans)

1638
01:20:58,169 --> 01:20:59,421
That's right.

1639
01:20:59,421 --> 01:21:01,923
Oh, come closer, so I
can tell you something.

1640
01:21:05,043 --> 01:21:06,294
My coconut is empty.

1641
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:07,546
Y...

1642
01:21:08,179 --> 01:21:08,797
Oh.

1643
01:21:12,551 --> 01:21:13,802
Have a belt yourself.

1644
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:15,687
Uh... no, no, thanks.

1645
01:21:15,687 --> 01:21:18,189
Uh, th-there'll be
plenty of time later.

1646
01:21:18,189 --> 01:21:20,058
Uh, I mean,
y-you go ahead.

1647
01:21:23,194 --> 01:21:25,063
What was she like?

1648
01:21:25,063 --> 01:21:26,314
"She" who?

1649
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:29,451
The lady who drove
you to this.

1650
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:31,953
"Drove me to" what?

1651
01:21:31,953 --> 01:21:33,204
Drink.

1652
01:21:33,204 --> 01:21:36,324
Oh, there was no lady.

1653
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:37,576
That was your wife.

1654
01:21:37,576 --> 01:21:38,827
(laughing)

1655
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:45,083
No, uh,
there was no wife.

1656
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:48,837
Then from what are you
running away from... hmm?

1657
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:50,722
Oh, I'm not running away.

1658
01:21:50,722 --> 01:21:53,224
Oh, there must've
been some... some...

1659
01:21:53,224 --> 01:21:55,093
Well, well, therewas.

1660
01:21:55,093 --> 01:21:56,344
It was a necktie.

1661
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:57,596
A what?

1662
01:21:57,596 --> 01:21:58,847
A necktie.

1663
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:00,098
I was late for class
one morning.

1664
01:22:00,732 --> 01:22:01,349
I forgot my tie.

1665
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:03,234
They wouldn't let me in.

1666
01:22:03,852 --> 01:22:05,737
Um, how long ago
was that?

1667
01:22:05,737 --> 01:22:06,988
About eight years ago.

1668
01:22:07,606 --> 01:22:10,742
Weren't you a little old
to be going to school?

1669
01:22:10,742 --> 01:22:11,993
Oh, I wasn't going.

1670
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:13,244
Well...

1671
01:22:16,364 --> 01:22:17,616
(clears throat)

1672
01:22:17,616 --> 01:22:18,867
I was teaching.

1673
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:20,118
Oh...

1674
01:22:20,118 --> 01:22:22,003
I was a professor
of history.

1675
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:22,621
Ah.

1676
01:22:23,254 --> 01:22:24,506
A-A-And what about
the necktie?

1677
01:22:25,123 --> 01:22:27,008
Well, now, this is no time
to talk about me.

1678
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:28,259
Why not?

1679
01:22:28,259 --> 01:22:29,511
(sighs)

1680
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:31,379
Yeah, why not?

1681
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:33,882
Well... see, I thought
they'd be more interested

1682
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:35,767
in what was inside
a man's head

1683
01:22:35,767 --> 01:22:37,018
not around his neck.

1684
01:22:37,636 --> 01:22:38,887
Mmm.

1685
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:41,389
Then I noticed
theyallwore ties.

1686
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:43,892
They all looked alike
and they all behaved alike

1687
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:45,143
and they all talked alike

1688
01:22:45,143 --> 01:22:47,028
but they were all going
the same way

1689
01:22:47,646 --> 01:22:50,148
no matter which way
they said they were going.

1690
01:22:50,148 --> 01:22:52,651
So, what was the use
of teaching them history

1691
01:22:52,651 --> 01:22:53,284
or anything?

1692
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:55,153
They weren't learning
by it...

1693
01:22:55,153 --> 01:22:57,656
still creating
the same old problems.

1694
01:22:57,656 --> 01:23:00,742
So, I packed, got on a boat
and got away from them.

1695
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:01,376
Mmm.

1696
01:23:01,993 --> 01:23:03,878
Mmm, now look what
they've got me doing.

1697
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:05,130
Mmm.

1698
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:06,381
(chuckles)

1699
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:08,883
(laughing)

1700
01:23:08,883 --> 01:23:10,135
Uh-huh.

1701
01:23:10,135 --> 01:23:11,386
What's so funny?

1702
01:23:12,003 --> 01:23:13,888
(laughing)

1703
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:15,757
You're the schoolteacher.

1704
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:18,259
(laughing continuing)

1705
01:23:20,145 --> 01:23:22,013
(gasps)

1706
01:23:22,013 --> 01:23:23,264
Oh, dear.

1707
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:27,652
No...

1708
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:34,526
Oh...

1709
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,028
(clicks tongue sadly)

1710
01:24:00,802 --> 01:24:02,053
What's that?

1711
01:24:02,053 --> 01:24:03,304
The snake.

1712
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:07,058
But that's not a snake.

1713
01:24:07,058 --> 01:24:08,943
It looks like a snake.

1714
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:11,446
You ninny.

1715
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:13,314
You'd better tell Mr. Eckland.

1716
01:24:13,314 --> 01:24:15,200
I want to go home.

1717
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,068
He'll be furious.

1718
01:24:17,068 --> 01:24:18,319
Why?

1719
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:20,822
Because Miss Freneau's
not dead.

1720
01:24:20,822 --> 01:24:22,073
Oh, la.

1721
01:24:27,078 --> 01:24:28,329
(clears throat)

1722
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:28,963
This is Eckland.

1723
01:24:29,581 --> 01:24:30,215
Is Houghton there?

1724
01:24:30,215 --> 01:24:31,466
(Morse code tapping)

1725
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:32,717
I'm here, Walter.

1726
01:24:32,717 --> 01:24:33,334
Frank...

1727
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:35,837
it's all over, Frank.

1728
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:37,088
She's, uh...

1729
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:39,591
I'm sorry.

1730
01:24:39,591 --> 01:24:40,842
Yeah.

1731
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:43,344
What do I do about the kids,
Frank?

1732
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:44,596
They don't know yet.

1733
01:24:44,596 --> 01:24:46,481
They'll have to be told, Walter.

1734
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:47,732
Yeah.

1735
01:24:47,732 --> 01:24:49,601
Well, stick around, will you?

1736
01:24:49,601 --> 01:24:50,852
I may need you later.

1737
01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:52,103
Sure, sure.

1738
01:24:52,103 --> 01:24:53,354
I'll stand by.

1739
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:57,108
(sighs)

1740
01:25:04,616 --> 01:25:05,867
Mr. Eckland...

1741
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:06,501
Oh, oh, oh.

1742
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:08,369
Uh, just a minute.

1743
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,255
I...

1744
01:25:10,255 --> 01:25:12,757
Uh, will you all come
over here, please?

1745
01:25:12,757 --> 01:25:14,008
Mr. Eckland...

1746
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:14,626
Ju-Just let me finish.

1747
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:16,511
There's something
I want to tell you.

1748
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:17,762
There's something we want
to tellyou.

1749
01:25:17,762 --> 01:25:19,013
Yeah, uh,
just a minute, now.

1750
01:25:19,013 --> 01:25:20,265
This isn't going
to be easy.

1751
01:25:20,265 --> 01:25:22,133
Now...

1752
01:25:23,384 --> 01:25:25,270
Those of you who
are old enough

1753
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:27,772
to understand what
I'm going to say

1754
01:25:27,772 --> 01:25:31,526
will be able to help the
ones who, uh... well...

1755
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:32,777
Mr. Eckland...

1756
01:25:32,777 --> 01:25:35,280
Uh, please,
there's a good girl.

1757
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:39,033
Now, Miss Freneau,
who I guess we all gave

1758
01:25:39,033 --> 01:25:42,153
a very difficult
time to when she...

1759
01:25:42,787 --> 01:25:44,038
Well...

1760
01:25:44,038 --> 01:25:46,541
Miss Freneau has...

1761
01:25:47,158 --> 01:25:49,043
has gone away.

1762
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:50,295
No, she hasn't.

1763
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:51,546
You tell him, Anne.

1764
01:25:52,163 --> 01:25:52,797
Why me?

1765
01:25:52,797 --> 01:25:54,666
Because it was
all your fault.

1766
01:25:54,666 --> 01:25:56,551
Uh, just a minute.

1767
01:25:56,551 --> 01:25:57,802
Tell me what?

1768
01:25:57,802 --> 01:25:59,671
I-It wasn't a snake.

1769
01:25:59,671 --> 01:26:00,889
It was this.

1770
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:04,642
But that's not a snake.

1771
01:26:04,642 --> 01:26:06,511
Itlookslike a snake.

1772
01:26:09,013 --> 01:26:11,516
Well, that's not a snake.

1773
01:26:11,516 --> 01:26:12,767
Here.

1774
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:14,018
Watch out
for the thorns.

1775
01:26:14,018 --> 01:26:15,270
(gasps)

1776
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:17,772
Thank you.

1777
01:26:17,772 --> 01:26:19,023
Not a snake.

1778
01:26:19,023 --> 01:26:20,909
Itlookslike a snake.

1779
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:24,028
No, that doesn't.

1780
01:26:32,170 --> 01:26:34,038
This looks
like a snake.

1781
01:26:46,551 --> 01:26:49,687
Is it morning already?

1782
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:54,692
Walter?

1783
01:26:54,692 --> 01:26:56,561
Are you there, Walter?

1784
01:26:56,561 --> 01:26:57,812
I have the chaplain.

1785
01:26:57,812 --> 01:27:00,315
I thought it might be a comfort
if he said a few words.

1786
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:02,817
Never mind the chaplain, Frank.

1787
01:27:02,817 --> 01:27:04,068
She's alive.

1788
01:27:04,702 --> 01:27:05,954
Thesnake'sdead.

1789
01:27:08,456 --> 01:27:09,707
Walter...

1790
01:27:09,707 --> 01:27:11,576
explain yourself.

1791
01:27:12,827 --> 01:27:14,078
Walter...

1792
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:16,581
Walter!

1793
01:27:17,832 --> 01:27:19,717
Walter!

1794
01:27:23,471 --> 01:27:26,591
Were you really
a schoolteacher?

1795
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:34,098
All of you, raise
your right hands.

1796
01:27:34,098 --> 01:27:35,984
Come on, raise your right hands.

1797
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:38,436
All right.

1798
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:41,572
Now, none of you heard
anything I said in there.

1799
01:27:41,572 --> 01:27:43,441
You got that?

1800
01:27:43,441 --> 01:27:45,326
Okay, now, spit.

1801
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:47,829
Go ahead. Spit.

1802
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:52,200
The first one
who breaks the pledge

1803
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,085
will get warts.

1804
01:27:56,587 --> 01:27:59,090
Qu'est-ce quewarts?

1805
01:28:41,349 --> 01:28:43,851
Uh... Mr. Eckland...

1806
01:28:44,469 --> 01:28:46,354
may I speak
with you, please?

1807
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:47,605
No.

1808
01:28:47,605 --> 01:28:50,108
Oh! Oh! You don't
have to shout.

1809
01:28:50,108 --> 01:28:52,610
I don't even
have to talk.

1810
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:54,479
Um... Mr. Eckland

1811
01:28:54,479 --> 01:28:56,981
do I owe you
an apology

1812
01:28:56,981 --> 01:28:59,484
or an explanation

1813
01:28:59,484 --> 01:29:01,986
or anything
like that?

1814
01:29:01,986 --> 01:29:03,237
Probably.

1815
01:29:03,237 --> 01:29:05,123
Some other time.

1816
01:29:05,123 --> 01:29:06,991
I seem to remember
someone saying

1817
01:29:06,991 --> 01:29:08,242
that a drop
or two helps...

1818
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:10,128
No, not that!

1819
01:29:10,128 --> 01:29:11,379
Ooh!

1820
01:29:11,379 --> 01:29:13,881
I went through enough nonsense
with you

1821
01:29:13,881 --> 01:29:15,133
just to get this much.

1822
01:29:17,635 --> 01:29:20,755
Mr. Eckland,
what, exactly

1823
01:29:20,755 --> 01:29:22,640
did I do
yesterday?

1824
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:24,509
Oh, nothing.

1825
01:29:24,509 --> 01:29:27,011
You just put a flower
between your teeth

1826
01:29:27,011 --> 01:29:28,896
and danced around
the room naked.

1827
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:30,148
I couldn't have!

1828
01:29:30,148 --> 01:29:32,016
I did?

1829
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:35,153
You mean
you don't remember?

1830
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:37,655
No.

1831
01:29:37,655 --> 01:29:39,524
Oh. Oh, well, then
you don't remember

1832
01:29:40,158 --> 01:29:41,409
anything I said, do you?

1833
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:43,277
Why? What
didyou say?

1834
01:29:43,277 --> 01:29:45,163
Nothing.

1835
01:29:45,163 --> 01:29:46,414
Well, there
doesn't seem to be

1836
01:29:47,031 --> 01:29:48,916
much to remember,
then, does there?

1837
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:51,419
No, no, no, no, no.

1838
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:53,287
Well, unless you
mean what you said

1839
01:29:53,287 --> 01:29:55,123
about running away
from civilization

1840
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:56,374
because
of a necktie.

1841
01:29:56,374 --> 01:29:59,510
I thought you said
you didn't remember anything!

1842
01:29:59,510 --> 01:30:02,013
Oh, oh, oh...
nothing after that.

1843
01:30:02,013 --> 01:30:03,881
There wasn't anything
after that!

1844
01:30:03,881 --> 01:30:05,133
Then when did
I dance around naked

1845
01:30:05,767 --> 01:30:07,018
with a flower
between my teeth?

1846
01:30:07,018 --> 01:30:08,886
I only told you
those things about me

1847
01:30:08,886 --> 01:30:10,138
in strictest confidence.

1848
01:30:10,138 --> 01:30:12,023
Why, I haven't
told anyone.

1849
01:30:12,023 --> 01:30:14,525
You just told me,
didn't you?

1850
01:30:14,525 --> 01:30:16,394
You are the one
who told me.

1851
01:30:16,394 --> 01:30:17,645
Well, I don't care!

1852
01:30:17,645 --> 01:30:19,530
I only told you because
I thought you were dying.

1853
01:30:19,530 --> 01:30:22,033
Sorry
I disappointed you.

1854
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:24,535
Oh...

1855
01:30:27,655 --> 01:30:28,906
I... I don't mind

1856
01:30:28,906 --> 01:30:31,409
that you were
a schoolteacher.

1857
01:30:31,409 --> 01:30:32,660
There you go again!

1858
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:35,163
Now, it's none
of your business.

1859
01:30:35,163 --> 01:30:37,048
I-I... I thought
you were running away

1860
01:30:37,048 --> 01:30:39,550
from something
muchworse than that.

1861
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:40,802
I wasn't running away.

1862
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:42,670
I was escaping
from hypocrites like you

1863
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:44,555
who have to get drunk
before they can let go.

1864
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:51,429
There.

1865
01:30:51,429 --> 01:30:53,314
Well, then, you're a happy man.

1866
01:30:53,314 --> 01:30:54,565
That's right.

1867
01:30:54,565 --> 01:30:55,817
And that's why
youdrink so much--

1868
01:30:55,817 --> 01:30:57,068
because you are so happy.

1869
01:30:57,068 --> 01:30:58,319
Yes.

1870
01:31:01,439 --> 01:31:02,690
Is this boat tilted?

1871
01:31:03,324 --> 01:31:04,575
No.

1872
01:31:04,575 --> 01:31:05,827
Now, you listen to me.

1873
01:31:05,827 --> 01:31:08,329
Before you mess around
with other people's lives

1874
01:31:08,329 --> 01:31:09,580
you'd better take
a look at your own.

1875
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:10,832
And what's
wrong with it?

1876
01:31:11,449 --> 01:31:13,334
Well, maybe, if you'd
stop straightening pictures

1877
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:14,585
and let men
wear their own pants

1878
01:31:15,203 --> 01:31:16,454
maybe they'd
be able to touch you

1879
01:31:16,454 --> 01:31:17,705
without askingpermesso.

1880
01:31:37,058 --> 01:31:38,709
Dear Lord...

1881
01:31:38,709 --> 01:31:41,212
Oh, Harriet,
Dominique's going to say grace.

1882
01:31:41,212 --> 01:31:43,714
Mon Dieu, benicez-nous
articles de nourriture

1883
01:31:43,714 --> 01:31:45,600
que nous allons prendre.

1884
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,102
Et donnez du pain
a sur a mon faim.

1885
01:31:48,102 --> 01:31:49,971
All:
Amen.

1886
01:31:49,971 --> 01:31:53,107
Oh, Mr. Eckland.

1887
01:31:59,363 --> 01:32:01,866
Oh, uh, um... I thought,
if you had enough food, I...

1888
01:32:02,483 --> 01:32:03,734
Well, certainly.

1889
01:32:03,734 --> 01:32:05,620
Look, he's combed his hair.

1890
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:08,122
And he's actually
wearing socks.

1891
01:32:08,739 --> 01:32:11,242
Well, you see,
my feet were chilly.

1892
01:32:11,242 --> 01:32:13,127
Uh... I'm...

1893
01:32:13,127 --> 01:32:14,996
We're delighted
you could come.

1894
01:32:14,996 --> 01:32:17,498
Um... Anne, move over
next to Elizabeth

1895
01:32:17,498 --> 01:32:19,383
so Mr. Eckland can sit down.

1896
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:21,252
I don't want to sit there.

1897
01:32:21,252 --> 01:32:22,503
She never wants
to do anything.

1898
01:32:23,137 --> 01:32:23,754
That's not true.

1899
01:32:23,754 --> 01:32:25,006
I want to go home.

1900
01:32:25,006 --> 01:32:26,257
All right, Anne.

1901
01:32:26,257 --> 01:32:28,142
Uh... change places
with Harriet.

1902
01:32:28,142 --> 01:32:29,393
My name's Harry.

1903
01:32:29,393 --> 01:32:30,645
Oh, sorry.

1904
01:32:31,262 --> 01:32:33,147
Harry, on the other side
of Mr. Eckland.

1905
01:32:33,147 --> 01:32:34,398
Thank you, Harry.

1906
01:32:34,398 --> 01:32:36,267
We fellas should
stick together.

1907
01:32:56,921 --> 01:32:58,789
Passez a Monsieur Eckland.

1908
01:33:01,926 --> 01:33:03,794
That'smydinner.

1909
01:33:04,428 --> 01:33:06,297
Well, then take it.

1910
01:33:07,548 --> 01:33:09,433
I'm sick and tired
of tinned beef.

1911
01:33:09,433 --> 01:33:11,302
Then give it back.

1912
01:33:11,302 --> 01:33:13,187
I want to go home.
I want to go home.

1913
01:33:13,187 --> 01:33:15,056
Why can't we have fish
once in a while?

1914
01:33:15,056 --> 01:33:17,558
Professor Eckland
was giving me lessons

1915
01:33:17,558 --> 01:33:18,809
but he never finishes

1916
01:33:18,809 --> 01:33:20,061
what he starts.

1917
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:21,946
(choking)

1918
01:33:21,946 --> 01:33:23,197
Raise your arms.

1919
01:33:23,814 --> 01:33:24,448
Lower your head.

1920
01:33:24,448 --> 01:33:26,317
Bebez de l'eau.
Bebez de l'eau.

1921
01:33:26,317 --> 01:33:26,951
Drink something.

1922
01:33:26,951 --> 01:33:28,819
Give him something
to drink, quick.

1923
01:33:29,453 --> 01:33:30,071
Drink.

1924
01:33:30,705 --> 01:33:31,956
Hold it.

1925
01:33:31,956 --> 01:33:33,207
Jenny!

1926
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:36,327
Well, how strange...

1927
01:33:36,327 --> 01:33:37,578
Why?

1928
01:33:37,578 --> 01:33:38,829
that you should
bring me this.

1929
01:33:39,463 --> 01:33:40,715
I've done it before.

1930
01:33:40,715 --> 01:33:41,966
No, you haven't.
Yes, I have.

1931
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:43,834
Shut up.

1932
01:33:44,468 --> 01:33:46,971
Well, since it's here,
I'll, uh...

1933
01:33:46,971 --> 01:33:48,839
Uh-uh-uh... there's
already a beverage

1934
01:33:49,473 --> 01:33:50,725
on the table,
Mr. Eckland.

1935
01:33:50,725 --> 01:33:51,342
Yes? What?

1936
01:33:51,342 --> 01:33:52,593
Coconut milk.

1937
01:33:52,593 --> 01:33:55,062
You're kidding.

1938
01:33:55,062 --> 01:33:56,931
Well, it happens
to be very tasty

1939
01:33:56,931 --> 01:33:58,182
and quite healthful.

1940
01:33:58,182 --> 01:34:00,067
Well, I'm sure it is.

1941
01:34:00,067 --> 01:34:01,319
Uh-uh-uh-uh...

1942
01:34:01,319 --> 01:34:03,821
Mr. Eckland...

1943
01:34:21,956 --> 01:34:23,841
Delicious.

1944
01:34:23,841 --> 01:34:25,092
Coconut milk.

1945
01:34:25,092 --> 01:34:26,961
Young coconuts must love it.

1946
01:34:26,961 --> 01:34:29,463
(all laughing)

1947
01:34:29,463 --> 01:34:33,217
(airplane engine roaring)

1948
01:34:59,493 --> 01:35:00,745
Get back!

1949
01:35:01,379 --> 01:35:02,630
Get back!

1950
01:35:29,523 --> 01:35:31,409
Come on.
Let's get back in the shack.

1951
01:35:31,409 --> 01:35:32,660
Uh... I-I...

1952
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:35,162
I hurt my ankle when you...

1953
01:35:35,162 --> 01:35:37,031
when I fell.

1954
01:35:37,665 --> 01:35:39,533
Now, get up.

1955
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:41,419
Now, let's see.

1956
01:35:41,419 --> 01:35:43,287
Put your
weight on it.

1957
01:35:43,287 --> 01:35:45,172
That's not too bad.

1958
01:35:47,041 --> 01:35:48,926
All right.

1959
01:35:50,795 --> 01:35:52,046
That's fine.

1960
01:36:02,690 --> 01:36:04,558
This is Eckland. Get Houghton.

1961
01:36:04,558 --> 01:36:07,695
Man:
Stand by, Mother Goose.

1962
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:10,815
Houghton:
Yes, Walter, what is it?

1963
01:36:10,815 --> 01:36:12,066
A plane, Frank.

1964
01:36:12,066 --> 01:36:13,317
He dove at us.

1965
01:36:13,317 --> 01:36:14,568
Go on.

1966
01:36:14,568 --> 01:36:16,454
Well, go on where?
He spotted us.

1967
01:36:16,454 --> 01:36:18,956
And now you'd like me to take
you off the island, is that it?

1968
01:36:19,573 --> 01:36:20,825
Naturally.

1969
01:36:20,825 --> 01:36:22,076
Really, Walter?
You never give up, do you?

1970
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:23,961
All right,
tell me what happened.

1971
01:36:23,961 --> 01:36:25,212
I've already told you.

1972
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:26,464
A Japanese plane flew over.

1973
01:36:27,081 --> 01:36:27,715
What kind?

1974
01:36:27,715 --> 01:36:28,966
I don't know what kind.

1975
01:36:28,966 --> 01:36:30,835
Well, that's what
you're there for, isn't it?

1976
01:36:31,469 --> 01:36:33,337
Really, Walter,
planes are supposed to fly over.

1977
01:36:33,337 --> 01:36:34,555
We wouldn't need you

1978
01:36:34,555 --> 01:36:36,423
where planesdidn'tfly over,
would we?

1979
01:36:36,423 --> 01:36:38,926
Now, just because
one gets a little close...

1980
01:36:38,926 --> 01:36:39,560
Alittleclose!

1981
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:40,811
Now, you listen to me, Frank.

1982
01:36:40,811 --> 01:36:42,062
You get us out of here
by tonight.

1983
01:36:42,062 --> 01:36:45,182
I really don't think
it will be tonight, Walter.

1984
01:36:45,182 --> 01:36:46,433
Thanks a lot.

1985
01:36:46,433 --> 01:36:48,319
I won't need you
when I get the launch ready.

1986
01:36:48,319 --> 01:36:50,821
Walter, I'd forget
about the launch if I were you.

1987
01:36:50,821 --> 01:36:52,690
You're completely
ringed in there

1988
01:36:52,690 --> 01:36:55,192
which means you could
only travel by night--

1989
01:36:55,192 --> 01:36:57,077
in a boat which
you can't be too sure of.

1990
01:36:57,077 --> 01:37:00,197
And, even if you could break
through-- which I doubt--

1991
01:37:00,197 --> 01:37:02,082
Port Moresby
is the only place open

1992
01:37:02,082 --> 01:37:03,951
and that's over 200 miles away.

1993
01:37:03,951 --> 01:37:05,202
Then do something.

1994
01:37:05,202 --> 01:37:07,087
Walter, I have 32 men

1995
01:37:07,087 --> 01:37:09,590
in precisely the same position
you're in.

1996
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:12,710
How is it that I spend most
of my time listening to you?

1997
01:37:12,710 --> 01:37:14,595
Now, be a good chap and relax.

1998
01:37:14,595 --> 01:37:15,846
Signing off.

1999
01:37:17,097 --> 01:37:18,966
The fathead.

2000
01:37:18,966 --> 01:37:20,851
I'll be down at the launch.

2001
01:37:27,107 --> 01:37:28,359
Mr. Eckland?

2002
01:37:28,359 --> 01:37:30,227
Hmm?

2003
01:37:35,866 --> 01:37:37,117
Hmm?

2004
01:37:37,735 --> 01:37:39,620
Oh, I thought
your ankle was
bothering you.

2005
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:42,122
Oh, well, it feels
much better now, thank you.

2006
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:43,374
Fine.

2007
01:37:43,374 --> 01:37:44,625
I wanted
to thank you.

2008
01:37:44,625 --> 01:37:45,876
For saving my life,
I mean.

2009
01:37:45,876 --> 01:37:47,127
I behaved
quite stupidly.

2010
01:37:47,127 --> 01:37:48,379
Can you forgive me?

2011
01:37:48,379 --> 01:37:49,630
Sure.

2012
01:37:49,630 --> 01:37:51,498
I wouldn't want you
to think badly of me.

2013
01:37:51,498 --> 01:37:52,750
No.
Doyou think
 badly of me?

2014
01:37:53,384 --> 01:37:54,635
I don't think badly
of you either.

2015
01:37:55,252 --> 01:37:55,886
Good for you.

2016
01:37:55,886 --> 01:37:57,755
Mr. Eckland?

2017
01:37:57,755 --> 01:38:00,257
You can kiss me if you want.

2018
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,011
I may?

2019
01:38:07,147 --> 01:38:08,399
Oh, my darling.

2020
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:10,267
I have thought
of nothing else

2021
01:38:10,267 --> 01:38:12,152
since that moment we met.

2022
01:38:12,152 --> 01:38:15,272
This first burning kiss
is but the beginning.

2023
01:38:15,272 --> 01:38:17,157
Tonight, you will
leave those children

2024
01:38:17,157 --> 01:38:19,026
and come live with me
on my boat.

2025
01:38:19,026 --> 01:38:20,911
What... what
are you doing?

2026
01:38:20,911 --> 01:38:22,162
But of course.

2027
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:24,031
How thoughtless of me.

2028
01:38:24,031 --> 01:38:25,282
We must be careful.

2029
01:38:25,282 --> 01:38:29,036
What time can I
expect you tonight?

2030
01:38:29,036 --> 01:38:31,538
But Mademoiselle
doesn't let us out at night.

2031
01:38:39,046 --> 01:38:40,931
Oh, well.

2032
01:38:42,766 --> 01:38:44,451
(engine grinding)

2033
01:38:44,451 --> 01:38:46,954
(grinding)

2034
01:38:48,205 --> 01:38:50,708
Mr. Eckland, have you
been listening to me?

2035
01:38:50,708 --> 01:38:51,959
How can I help it

2036
01:38:52,576 --> 01:38:54,461
with you screaming
in my ear?

2037
01:38:54,461 --> 01:38:56,964
Because you've been talking
total nonsense, as usual.

2038
01:38:57,581 --> 01:38:58,832
It's quite clear

2039
01:38:58,832 --> 01:39:00,718
you know nothing
whatsoever about children.

2040
01:39:00,718 --> 01:39:03,220
Uh-huh, and you're
an expert, of course.

2041
01:39:03,220 --> 01:39:05,089
I know one thing--
Elizabeth is at that...

2042
01:39:05,089 --> 01:39:06,340
Wait, wait, wait.

2043
01:39:06,974 --> 01:39:07,591
Hand me those
pliers, will you?

2044
01:39:08,225 --> 01:39:08,842
Which one?

2045
01:39:08,842 --> 01:39:10,094
The small one.

2046
01:39:10,094 --> 01:39:10,728
This?

2047
01:39:11,345 --> 01:39:12,596
Thank you. Now,
what were you saying?

2048
01:39:12,596 --> 01:39:15,099
Elizabeth
is at that difficult age

2049
01:39:15,099 --> 01:39:16,350
and you frightened her.

2050
01:39:16,984 --> 01:39:19,486
Yeah, well,
I'm at a difficult age myself.

2051
01:39:19,486 --> 01:39:21,355
She nearly scared me to death.

2052
01:39:21,355 --> 01:39:24,491
How about teaching those kids
the facts of life?

2053
01:39:24,491 --> 01:39:26,994
Or don't you
feel you're up
on the subject?

2054
01:39:26,994 --> 01:39:28,862
I wouldn't exactly
call them backwards.

2055
01:39:28,862 --> 01:39:31,365
Not the way they were
watching during lunch.

2056
01:39:31,365 --> 01:39:32,616
Watching what?

2057
01:39:32,616 --> 01:39:35,119
(engine starts)

2058
01:39:35,119 --> 01:39:36,370
(engine running)

2059
01:39:36,370 --> 01:39:38,255
It worked!

2060
01:39:38,255 --> 01:39:40,124
Of course it worked.

2061
01:39:40,124 --> 01:39:42,009
Now, what were they
watching during lunch?

2062
01:39:42,626 --> 01:39:43,877
They were watching us.

2063
01:39:43,877 --> 01:39:45,763
Watching us what?

2064
01:39:45,763 --> 01:39:47,631
Watching us
watch each other.

2065
01:39:47,631 --> 01:39:48,882
So we watched each other.

2066
01:39:48,882 --> 01:39:50,134
So what?

2067
01:39:50,134 --> 01:39:51,385
They're not
blind, you know.

2068
01:39:52,019 --> 01:39:53,887
What do they
think watching is--

2069
01:39:53,887 --> 01:39:55,139
a proposal of marriage?

2070
01:39:55,139 --> 01:39:56,390
Whoever said
anything about...

2071
01:39:57,024 --> 01:39:58,275
Just because
a man puts on socks

2072
01:39:58,275 --> 01:39:59,526
and comes to lunch...

2073
01:40:00,144 --> 01:40:02,029
If you think I'd want
to get involved with

2074
01:40:02,029 --> 01:40:05,149
an undisciplined, self-indulgent
escapist like you...

2075
01:40:05,149 --> 01:40:08,285
Well, that's better than being
a frustrated spinster

2076
01:40:08,285 --> 01:40:10,154
who can't
find a husband.

2077
01:40:28,305 --> 01:40:28,889
Spoke to Oliver, Sir.

2078
01:40:29,506 --> 01:40:31,392
Mother Goose is
requesting a chaplain.

2079
01:40:31,392 --> 01:40:33,260
A chaplain?
Good heavens, he's killed her.

2080
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:34,511
No, sir.

2081
01:40:34,511 --> 01:40:35,763
They want to get married.

2082
01:40:37,014 --> 01:40:38,265
Married?

2083
01:40:38,265 --> 01:40:41,402
Goody Two-shoes
and the Filthy Beast?

2084
01:40:45,739 --> 01:40:46,990
What's taking
him so long?

2085
01:40:46,990 --> 01:40:48,242
He's had enough
time to get

2086
01:40:48,859 --> 01:40:50,110
the Archbishop
of Canterbury.

2087
01:40:50,110 --> 01:40:51,361
Oh, Mr. Eckland,
really.

2088
01:40:51,361 --> 01:40:53,247
Oh, stop calling me
Mr. Eckland.

2089
01:40:53,247 --> 01:40:54,498
It sounds ridiculous.

2090
01:40:54,498 --> 01:40:57,618
Houghton:
Walter? Are you ready, Walter?

2091
01:40:57,618 --> 01:40:59,503
Just a minute, Frank.

2092
01:41:02,623 --> 01:41:03,874
Here, use my tie.

2093
01:41:04,508 --> 01:41:05,759
Oh, thank you, Harriet

2094
01:41:05,759 --> 01:41:07,628
but ties don't
suit Mr. Eckland.

2095
01:41:11,381 --> 01:41:12,633
Oh.

2096
01:41:12,633 --> 01:41:14,518
Have you got
the chaplain, Frank?

2097
01:41:14,518 --> 01:41:16,386
Yes, he's here.

2098
01:41:16,386 --> 01:41:19,523
There's a little
paperwork, Walter.

2099
01:41:19,523 --> 01:41:20,774
Bride's full name.

2100
01:41:20,774 --> 01:41:27,030
Catherine Louise Marie
Ernestine Freneau.

2101
01:41:27,648 --> 01:41:29,533
Groom's full name.

2102
01:41:29,533 --> 01:41:32,035
Walter Christopher Eckland.

2103
01:41:32,035 --> 01:41:33,287
Mm.

2104
01:41:34,538 --> 01:41:35,789
Witnesses.

2105
01:41:35,789 --> 01:41:36,406
Who's the maid of honor?

2106
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:39,543
Um, Elizabeth Anderson.

2107
01:41:39,543 --> 01:41:41,411
And the best man?

2108
01:41:45,799 --> 01:41:46,416
Oh.

2109
01:41:46,416 --> 01:41:47,668
Harry McGregor.

2110
01:41:47,668 --> 01:41:49,553
Harry?

2111
01:41:49,553 --> 01:41:50,804
Just believe me.

2112
01:41:51,421 --> 01:41:52,673
Proceed, padre.

2113
01:41:52,673 --> 01:41:53,924
Thank you.

2114
01:41:56,426 --> 01:42:00,180
Now, is everyone ready?

2115
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:02,065
Yes, padre.

2116
01:42:02,065 --> 01:42:04,568
(playing "The Wedding March")

2117
01:42:04,568 --> 01:42:06,436
Dearly beloved

2118
01:42:06,436 --> 01:42:08,939
we are gathered here

2119
01:42:09,573 --> 01:42:13,327
and... there, in the presence
of these witnesses

2120
01:42:13,327 --> 01:42:17,080
to join together
this man and this woman

2121
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:18,949
in the bonds of holy matrimony

2122
01:42:19,583 --> 01:42:22,085
which is an honorable estate
instituted of God...

2123
01:42:22,085 --> 01:42:23,954
(airplane approaching)

2124
01:42:23,954 --> 01:42:25,205
into this holy estate.

2125
01:42:25,205 --> 01:42:28,959
These two persons
come now to be joined.

2126
01:42:28,959 --> 01:42:30,210
Duck! Down, quickly!

2127
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:31,461
Get undercover!

2128
01:42:36,466 --> 01:42:38,352
If there be any present...

2129
01:42:38,352 --> 01:42:39,603
Up!

2130
01:42:39,603 --> 01:42:41,471
Everyone out!
Come on, all of you!

2131
01:42:41,471 --> 01:42:43,357
Quickly.
Come on, come on, get going!

2132
01:42:43,357 --> 01:42:46,476
...why they may not lawfully
be joined in marriage

2133
01:42:46,476 --> 01:42:48,979
I require him now to make it
known or ever after

2134
01:42:48,979 --> 01:42:50,230
to hold his peace.

2135
01:42:52,115 --> 01:42:54,618
Any-anything there?

2136
01:42:54,618 --> 01:42:55,869
Good.

2137
01:42:55,869 --> 01:42:57,120
Now, then.

2138
01:42:57,120 --> 01:42:59,623
Do you,
Walter Christopher Eckland

2139
01:42:59,623 --> 01:43:03,994
take this woman to be
your lawful wedded wife

2140
01:43:03,994 --> 01:43:06,496
to love and to cherish

2141
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:08,382
to have and to hold

2142
01:43:08,382 --> 01:43:10,884
so long as you both shall live?

2143
01:43:15,255 --> 01:43:17,758
Uh, Mr. Eckland?

2144
01:43:17,758 --> 01:43:21,511
Do you,
Walter Christopher Eckland...

2145
01:43:21,511 --> 01:43:22,145
Walter!

2146
01:43:22,145 --> 01:43:23,397
Stay there!

2147
01:43:24,014 --> 01:43:25,899
...to be your lawful
wedded wife?

2148
01:43:25,899 --> 01:43:27,768
Hold it, padre. Hold it.

2149
01:43:27,768 --> 01:43:29,019
Mr. Eckland, do you...?

2150
01:43:29,019 --> 01:43:30,904
I do, I do. Get Houghton, quick.

2151
01:43:31,521 --> 01:43:32,155
What is it, Walter?

2152
01:43:32,155 --> 01:43:33,407
They came back, Frank.

2153
01:43:33,407 --> 01:43:34,658
I told you they would.

2154
01:43:34,658 --> 01:43:35,909
Who came back?

2155
01:43:35,909 --> 01:43:38,412
You know who. Now listen!

2156
01:43:38,412 --> 01:43:39,663
(airplane approaching)

2157
01:43:45,285 --> 01:43:46,536
Did you hear that?!

2158
01:43:46,536 --> 01:43:49,039
Yes, I'll get onto it
right away. Stand by.

2159
01:43:49,039 --> 01:43:50,924
I want the name
and exact position

2160
01:43:50,924 --> 01:43:52,175
of every
Allied submarine

2161
01:43:52,175 --> 01:43:53,427
within 12 hours'
running distance

2162
01:43:54,044 --> 01:43:54,678
between here
and Matalava

2163
01:43:55,295 --> 01:43:56,546
and get onto it
right away.

2164
01:43:56,546 --> 01:43:57,798
Aye, aye, Sir.

2165
01:43:59,049 --> 01:44:00,300
Walter.

2166
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:02,185
I told you to stay
where you were.

2167
01:44:02,803 --> 01:44:03,437
The plane's gone.

2168
01:44:04,054 --> 01:44:05,305
I was afraid
I was a widow

2169
01:44:05,305 --> 01:44:07,190
before we were
even married.

2170
01:44:07,190 --> 01:44:09,693
Uh, er, Mr. Eckland.

2171
01:44:09,693 --> 01:44:12,195
What should we do now?

2172
01:44:12,195 --> 01:44:15,315
Well, all right, we'll take
another whack at it

2173
01:44:15,315 --> 01:44:17,200
if you will, padre.

2174
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:19,069
So take your time,
but hurry it up.

2175
01:44:19,069 --> 01:44:20,320
Oh, eh, yes, yes, of course.

2176
01:44:20,954 --> 01:44:21,571
I understand. Uh...

2177
01:44:21,571 --> 01:44:22,823
Let me see now.

2178
01:44:22,823 --> 01:44:24,708
Do you Walter
Christopher Eckland

2179
01:44:25,325 --> 01:44:26,576
take this woman...?

2180
01:44:26,576 --> 01:44:28,462
Oh, we-we did
that part, padre.

2181
01:44:28,462 --> 01:44:29,713
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

2182
01:44:29,713 --> 01:44:31,581
I-I'm a little rattled.

2183
01:44:31,581 --> 01:44:33,467
Uh, let me see here.

2184
01:44:33,467 --> 01:44:34,718
All right, then.

2185
01:44:34,718 --> 01:44:37,838
Do you Catherine Louise
Marie Ernestine Freneau.

2186
01:44:37,838 --> 01:44:40,974
take this man to be
your lawful wedded husband

2187
01:44:40,974 --> 01:44:43,477
to love and to cherish,
to have and to hold

2188
01:44:43,477 --> 01:44:45,979
for as long
as you both shall live?

2189
01:44:45,979 --> 01:44:47,230
I do.

2190
01:44:47,230 --> 01:44:50,317
Forasmuch as you have consented
together in holy wedlock

2191
01:44:50,317 --> 01:44:53,437
and have given and received
a ring in token of your troth...

2192
01:44:53,437 --> 01:44:54,688
Wait a minute.
What ring?

2193
01:44:54,688 --> 01:44:55,939
Didn't we do the ring?

2194
01:44:55,939 --> 01:44:57,190
No, we didn't
do the ring.

2195
01:44:57,824 --> 01:44:59,693
Oh, I'm afraid
we'll have to do the ring.

2196
01:45:03,447 --> 01:45:05,332
Well, here.

2197
01:45:05,332 --> 01:45:06,583
Hold it, padre.

2198
01:45:14,708 --> 01:45:15,342
All right, padre.

2199
01:45:15,342 --> 01:45:16,593
We did the ring.

2200
01:45:16,593 --> 01:45:17,844
Oh, good.

2201
01:45:18,462 --> 01:45:20,964
Forasmuch as you have consented
together in holy wedlock

2202
01:45:20,964 --> 01:45:24,101
and have given and received
a ring in token of your troth

2203
01:45:24,101 --> 01:45:25,969
I now declare you
husband and wife.

2204
01:45:28,472 --> 01:45:32,859
You may kiss the bride,
Mr. Eckland.

2205
01:45:32,859 --> 01:45:35,362
Mr. and Mrs. Eckland,
if you're finished now

2206
01:45:35,362 --> 01:45:37,864
I suggest you
get the hell out of there.

2207
01:45:37,864 --> 01:45:39,733
Yeah, that's a good
suggestion, padre.

2208
01:45:39,733 --> 01:45:41,618
Thank you.

2209
01:45:41,618 --> 01:45:42,869
Hold on, Walter, hold on.

2210
01:45:43,487 --> 01:45:44,738
What, Frank?

2211
01:45:44,738 --> 01:45:47,874
One of your American submarines,
theSailfin,is in your area.

2212
01:45:48,492 --> 01:45:49,126
She's running submerged

2213
01:45:49,743 --> 01:45:51,628
so we'll not be able
to make radio contact

2214
01:45:51,628 --> 01:45:53,497
with her until
she surfaces tonight

2215
01:45:53,497 --> 01:45:55,999
but she ought to be able
to get through to you

2216
01:45:55,999 --> 01:45:57,250
by dawn tomorrow.

2217
01:45:57,250 --> 01:45:59,753
She'll have to lie off the reef
to await your signal

2218
01:45:59,753 --> 01:46:01,638
so I suggest
you stay on the beach.

2219
01:46:01,638 --> 01:46:02,889
Have you got that?

2220
01:46:02,889 --> 01:46:03,507
I've got it.

2221
01:46:04,091 --> 01:46:04,725
Oh, and incidentally,
Walter

2222
01:46:05,342 --> 01:46:06,593
congratulations
to you and Mrs. Eckland.

2223
01:46:07,227 --> 01:46:09,096
and the best of luck
to all of you.

2224
01:46:10,347 --> 01:46:10,981
Mmm.

2225
01:46:10,981 --> 01:46:12,849
And they're
going to need it.

2226
01:46:17,037 --> 01:46:18,922
Walter, are
you awake?

2227
01:46:19,539 --> 01:46:20,791
Uh-huh.

2228
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:23,293
I was thinking
about yesterday.

2229
01:46:25,796 --> 01:46:27,681
Somehow, the word "wedding"

2230
01:46:27,681 --> 01:46:30,183
has always called to mind
a different picture.

2231
01:46:30,183 --> 01:46:32,052
Mm-hmm. Somehow the words
"wedding night"

2232
01:46:32,686 --> 01:46:35,188
have always called to mind
a different picture, too.

2233
01:46:37,057 --> 01:46:38,942
Well, we couldn't
very well have left

2234
01:46:38,942 --> 01:46:40,811
the girls by
themselves.

2235
01:46:40,811 --> 01:46:42,062
They're our
responsibility.

2236
01:46:42,696 --> 01:46:43,947
They're not
ourchildren.

2237
01:46:43,947 --> 01:46:45,198
No, if theywere
our children

2238
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:48,318
they'd have never gotten
tobeour children, would they?

2239
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:53,957
You won't be coming
with us, will you?

2240
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:57,711
How did you know?

2241
01:46:57,711 --> 01:47:00,213
Oh, when a woman
has been married
as long as I have

2242
01:47:00,213 --> 01:47:02,082
she knows what her
husband's thinking.

2243
01:47:03,967 --> 01:47:04,584
Oh, well.

2244
01:47:04,584 --> 01:47:07,087
I'll shove off
right after the rest of you

2245
01:47:07,087 --> 01:47:08,972
and get through
to Port Moresby in no time.

2246
01:47:08,972 --> 01:47:11,475
Well, you know
what Commander
Houghton said.

2247
01:47:11,475 --> 01:47:12,726
I can't leave my boat.

2248
01:47:14,594 --> 01:47:15,846
Must be a good one.

2249
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:18,982
Good or bad, it's all
the dowry you're going to get.

2250
01:47:18,982 --> 01:47:19,599
I'm thinking of starting

2251
01:47:20,233 --> 01:47:21,485
a charter service
right after the war.

2252
01:47:21,485 --> 01:47:23,987
Somewhere around the Solomons
and New Hebrides.

2253
01:47:23,987 --> 01:47:25,856
Good money there for anyone
who knows the islands.

2254
01:47:27,741 --> 01:47:31,495
All right. I'm not
leaving without you.

2255
01:47:31,495 --> 01:47:32,746
Oh, yes, you are.

2256
01:47:32,746 --> 01:47:34,614
Someone's got
to get those children

2257
01:47:34,614 --> 01:47:35,866
back to their parents.

2258
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:38,368
Lord, you're stubborn.

2259
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,619
That's right.

2260
01:47:39,619 --> 01:47:40,253
Come on.

2261
01:47:40,871 --> 01:47:42,122
Yeah, come on.

2262
01:47:42,122 --> 01:47:44,007
That's it. Go to sleep.

2263
01:47:48,378 --> 01:47:50,714
(engine humming)

2264
01:47:59,473 --> 01:48:00,724
They're here.

2265
01:48:00,724 --> 01:48:01,358
Hold it.

2266
01:48:01,358 --> 01:48:02,609
Girls.

2267
01:48:02,609 --> 01:48:03,860
Hold it.

2268
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:16,373
That's a Japanese
patrol boat.

2269
01:48:16,373 --> 01:48:17,624
Oh, my God.

2270
01:48:17,624 --> 01:48:18,875
They picked
a fine time

2271
01:48:18,875 --> 01:48:20,126
to check us out.

2272
01:48:20,126 --> 01:48:21,378
What about the submarine?

2273
01:48:21,378 --> 01:48:22,629
She won't surface

2274
01:48:22,629 --> 01:48:23,880
while that
thing's there.

2275
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:25,131
Get off the beach.

2276
01:48:25,131 --> 01:48:26,383
Come on.

2277
01:48:26,383 --> 01:48:27,634
Come on, girls.
Wake up!

2278
01:48:27,634 --> 01:48:29,503
Quickly as you can,
wake up! Come on!

2279
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:30,754
Take your gear.

2280
01:48:30,754 --> 01:48:32,005
Got it?
Thank you.

2281
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:55,161
They're sending
two boats ashore.

2282
01:48:55,161 --> 01:48:57,030
Now, these fellows
aren't looking for turtles.

2283
01:48:57,664 --> 01:48:58,281
They're looking for us.

2284
01:48:58,915 --> 01:49:00,166
Well, what if the
submarine leaves
without us?

2285
01:49:00,166 --> 01:49:01,418
Can't you
radio them?

2286
01:49:01,418 --> 01:49:02,669
No, I can't
make contact

2287
01:49:02,669 --> 01:49:03,286
while they're
submerged.

2288
01:49:03,286 --> 01:49:04,538
Now, take the kids
to the launch

2289
01:49:05,171 --> 01:49:06,423
and for God's sake
keep them quiet.

2290
01:49:06,423 --> 01:49:08,291
Here. Here...
Oh. Walter.

2291
01:49:08,291 --> 01:49:09,543
Hmm?

2292
01:49:09,543 --> 01:49:11,428
I look awful in black.

2293
01:50:03,346 --> 01:50:04,598
(growls)

2294
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:05,241
(air hissing)

2295
01:51:18,388 --> 01:51:19,639
Over here.

2296
01:51:21,508 --> 01:51:23,393
The house is on fire.

2297
01:51:23,393 --> 01:51:24,644
I know, I started it.

2298
01:51:24,644 --> 01:51:26,513
Oh. When did
you do that?

2299
01:51:26,513 --> 01:51:29,015
Oh... Last night,
when you were asleep.

2300
01:51:29,015 --> 01:51:30,266
What else
was there to do?

2301
01:51:30,266 --> 01:51:32,152
Hey, hide
all that stuff.

2302
01:51:32,152 --> 01:51:33,403
We're getting off
this island.

2303
01:51:33,403 --> 01:51:34,654
Is the submarine there?

2304
01:51:34,654 --> 01:51:35,905
It had better be.

2305
01:51:35,905 --> 01:51:37,157
Are we going
home now?

2306
01:51:37,157 --> 01:51:37,774
That's right.

2307
01:51:37,774 --> 01:51:39,025
I don't want
to go home.

2308
01:51:39,025 --> 01:51:40,276
Oh, come on.

2309
01:51:40,276 --> 01:51:42,779
Get in the dinghy
and hurry it up.

2310
01:51:48,418 --> 01:51:51,538
Commander Houghton said
there'd be a signal.

2311
01:51:51,538 --> 01:51:52,789
He wasn't joking.

2312
01:51:52,789 --> 01:51:55,291
They're coming out
to meet us in the launch.

2313
01:51:55,291 --> 01:51:57,794
Dead slow.

2314
01:51:57,794 --> 01:52:00,296
Dead slow, sir.

2315
01:52:00,296 --> 01:52:02,182
Answers dead slow.

2316
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:13,443
Holy cow.

2317
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:16,563
An enemy patrol boat
giving chase.

2318
01:52:29,075 --> 01:52:30,326
Ready the bow torpedo tubes.

2319
01:52:30,326 --> 01:52:31,578
Tubes forward, con.

2320
01:52:31,578 --> 01:52:32,829
Make ready forward tubes.

2321
01:52:32,829 --> 01:52:35,331
Submerged reef
300 yards from shore.

2322
01:52:35,331 --> 01:52:36,583
No torpedo clearance.

2323
01:52:39,085 --> 01:52:41,588
The launch is heading out
beyond the reef.

2324
01:52:41,588 --> 01:52:42,839
They're following.

2325
01:52:43,473 --> 01:52:44,724
That's what he's up to.

2326
01:52:44,724 --> 01:52:46,593
He's bringing them out to us.

2327
01:52:56,603 --> 01:52:58,488
They're plastering him.

2328
01:53:00,990 --> 01:53:04,110
He's cleared the reef.

2329
01:53:04,110 --> 01:53:07,864
They're right behind him.

2330
01:53:08,498 --> 01:53:09,115
Bearing?

2331
01:53:09,115 --> 01:53:12,252
Mark.

2332
01:53:12,252 --> 01:53:14,120
Zero two five.

2333
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:14,754
Range.

2334
01:53:16,005 --> 01:53:17,257
Mark.

2335
01:53:17,257 --> 01:53:20,376
Six five oh.

2336
01:53:20,376 --> 01:53:22,262
Tubes one and two,
open outer doors.

2337
01:53:23,513 --> 01:53:24,764
Tubes one and two,
open outer doors.

2338
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:32,272
Check fire. Check fire.

2339
01:53:32,272 --> 01:53:34,140
The launch is veering
into target path.

2340
01:53:37,277 --> 01:53:38,528
(explosion)

2341
01:53:42,899 --> 01:53:45,401
Get going, get going.

2342
01:54:01,050 --> 01:54:02,302
Final bearing.

2343
01:54:03,553 --> 01:54:04,804
Mark.

2344
01:54:04,804 --> 01:54:05,421
Fire one.

2345
01:54:05,421 --> 01:54:07,924
Fire two.

2346
01:54:17,317 --> 01:54:18,568
On the nose.

2347
01:54:22,939 --> 01:54:24,824
Not that it'll do those
poor devils any good

2348
01:54:24,824 --> 01:54:27,327
let's take her up and
look for survivors.

2349
01:54:27,944 --> 01:54:30,213
Freneau:
Walter!

2350
01:54:30,847 --> 01:54:33,967
Mr. Eckland!

2351
01:54:33,967 --> 01:54:35,852
Walter!

2352
01:54:35,852 --> 01:54:36,469
Oh, zig!

2353
01:54:37,103 --> 01:54:40,223
What's the matter
with this thing?

2354
01:54:40,223 --> 01:54:40,857
Mr. Eckland!

2355
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:47,730
There's his hat.

2356
01:54:48,364 --> 01:54:49,616
Jenny, move over.
I want to catch it.

2357
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:57,740
Mrs. Eckland,
I presume?

2358
01:54:57,740 --> 01:54:59,626
Mr. Eckland!
Walter!

2359
01:54:59,626 --> 01:55:01,494
Took me forever
to tie the wheel off.

2360
01:55:01,494 --> 01:55:03,379
I thought I'd have
to stay with her.

2361
01:55:03,997 --> 01:55:05,248
Our boat, theCatherine.

2362
01:55:05,248 --> 01:55:06,499
I'm sorry.

2363
01:55:06,499 --> 01:55:08,384
Yeah, well, in a war
everybody loses something.

2364
01:55:09,002 --> 01:55:10,253
I'm just glad
it wasthatCatherine.

2365
01:55:10,887 --> 01:55:12,138
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

2366
01:55:12,138 --> 01:55:14,007
Hold on. You want
to invite me in first?

2367
01:55:14,007 --> 01:55:15,258
Oh, uh...

2368
01:55:15,258 --> 01:55:16,509
Oh, Walter,
you'll tip us in.

2369
01:55:16,509 --> 01:55:17,760
(kids screaming)

2370
01:55:18,394 --> 01:55:19,646
Not if you do it right.

2371
01:55:19,646 --> 01:55:20,897
Now, just shift
your weight.

2372
01:55:20,897 --> 01:55:22,148
Get over there.
You, too.

2373
01:55:22,765 --> 01:55:24,651
Oh, uh, Walter,
I-I really don't think

2374
01:55:24,651 --> 01:55:25,902
it's such a good idea.

2375
01:55:25,902 --> 01:55:27,153
Now, p-please,
just this once

2376
01:55:27,770 --> 01:55:28,404
will you do it my way?

2377
01:55:29,022 --> 01:55:29,656
All right.

2378
01:55:44,037 --> 01:55:45,288
Shut up.

2379
01:55:45,288 --> 01:55:46,539
I didn't say anything.

2380
01:55:47,173 --> 01:55:49,676
It looks like we'll be
taking on passengers

2381
01:55:49,676 --> 01:55:51,511
after all,
Mr. Cartwright.

2382
01:55:51,511 --> 01:55:52,762
Break out a raft.

2383
01:55:52,762 --> 01:55:54,013
Aye, aye, Sir.

2384
01:55:55,882 --> 01:56:00,269
Oh, I wonder if they serve
coconut milk on submarines.

2385
01:56:00,269 --> 01:56:04,607
