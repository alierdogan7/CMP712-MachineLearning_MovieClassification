00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,046
Let's just keep it quiet, ma'am.

4
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,220
You speak English?

5
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,264
Yes.

6
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,259
Are there any Japs around?

7
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,521
You're...

8
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,898
You're an American.

9
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,441
Have the Americans...

10
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,609
No, no, no.

11
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,279
No, just me.

12
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,614
Just me, you understand?

13
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,658
Are there any Japs on the island?

14
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,951
No.

15
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,619
You're sure?

16
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,572
Yes, I'm sure.

17
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,084
All right, where are
the rest of you?

18
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,044
The rest?

19
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,964
Isn't there anybody
else on this island?

20
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,091
There is no one else here.

21
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,301
What, ma'am?

22
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,471
There is no one on
the island but me.

23
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,140
You're, uh...

24
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,351
You're alone here?

25
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,646
God has been with me.

26
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,482
You're, uh...

27
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,193

00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,987

32
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,873

Everything's pitching like I'm...

36
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,085
still on the raft.

37
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,423
I'd better lie down
before I fall down.

00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,601

You, ma'am. You...

42
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,617
You okay?

43
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,951
Yes. Yes.

44
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,835
I'm in no danger of any kind.

45
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,789
- Have no fear.
- Right.

Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us
sinners now and at the hour of our death.

50
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,320
Amen.

51
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,290
What gives, ma'am? We're
supposed to have a blackout.

52
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,875
If there were Japanese out there,

53
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,420
they could see those lights
15, 20 miles offshore.

54
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,881
- Do you see what I mean?
- Yes, I'm sorry, Mr....

This, uh...

58
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,062
This island got a name?

59
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,565
- Yes, uh, Tuasiva.
- An atoll, huh?

60
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,858
Yes.

61
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,069
Listen, did I hear right?

62
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,904
You're, uh...

63
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,240
You're all alone on this island?

64
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,693
Yes.

65
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,119
Since when?

66
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,498
Mr. Allison, you
must be very hungry.

67
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,001
I'll tell you what happened
after you've eaten.

68
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:12,921
There's some dried fruit and some
biscuits over in the bungalow.

69
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,624
I'll go for that.

How about seconds, ma'am?

72
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,469
There isn't anymore.

73
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,855
Why didn't you say so?

74
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,523
Fine guy that makes me,

75
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,942
taking food out of a woman's mouth,

76
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,527
especially a nun's.

77
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,651
You were starved, Mr. Allison.

78
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,035
I don't suppose there'd be
any cigarettes around, huh?

79
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,536
No.

80
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,489
No cigarettes.

81
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,834
What I wouldn't do for a smoke.

82
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,673
Who belongs to this?

83
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,968
It was Father Phillips' pipe.

84
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,680
He's buried down there.

85
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,983
How'd he die, ma'am?

86
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,154
The last few days were
too much for him.

87
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,491
I was at the mission at Wanitok.

88
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,493
That's in the Tua group.

89
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,995
The Japanese were raiding
islands all around us...

90
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,997
and conscripting the natives...

91
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,500
and making prisoners
of the Europeans.

92
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,669
A ship came for us.

93
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,006
Our instructions were to close
the mission and go to Fiji,

94
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,009
but Father Phillips wouldn't
leave without Father John Ryan,

95
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,008
who was alone here at Tuasiva.

96
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,598
It was against the ship's
orders to come for us,

97
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,518
so Father Phillips prevailed
upon some natives...

98
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,521
to bring us in a sailing craft.

99
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,357
It required all his
eloquence and money.

100
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,026
The crew was in terror
of the Japanese.

101
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,445
But why'd you come here, ma'am?

102
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,990
I mean, why didn't you go
to Fiji with the others?

103
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,992
Father Phillips was over 70...

104
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,616
Too old to make the voyage alone.

105
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,998
We landed here four days ago.

106
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,167
Father Ryan wasn't here.

107
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,794
No one was here.

108
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,123
The Japanese had come before us.

109
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,969
Go on, ma'am.

110
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,015
Father Phillips went all about
the island calling Father Ryan.

111
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,139
"John! John!"

112
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,020
We climbed up the hill,

113
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:37,524
and when we got to the top,
we saw our boat sailing off.

114
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:41,028
Poor souls. They had
simply lost courage.

115
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,530
Father Phillips said,
"God forgive them."

116
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,032
Nothing more.

117
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,034
Then we...

118
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,036
came back down the hill...

119
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,079
and sat here on the verandah.

120
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,328
He smoked his pipe...

121
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,626
and it grew dark.

122
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,205
I went inside and slept.

123
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,966
Next morning I found
him on the beach.

124
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,968
He had fallen.

125
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,796
He couldn't talk.

126
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,973
I gave him his crucifix.

127
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,975
He kissed it,

128
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,678
and he died.

129
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,481
That's tough, ma'am.

130
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,107
On you, I mean.

131
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,984
Why, I'm sure it's nothing...

132
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,654
to what you have been
through, Mr. Allison.

133
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,990
We was on a sub,

134
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,993
lying off some island
with a code name.

135
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,497
My party was supposed to
go ashore and do a recon.

136
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,166
We had the rafts over the side already.
We was just getting in them...

137
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,585
What I mean, we was
half on, half off.

138
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,295
Suddenly a light hits us.

139
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,006
Twenty-millimeter stuff
started pouring in.

140
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,008
So the skipper takes the sub down,

141
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,010
which is according to his book,

142
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,388
but a little tough on us gyrenes.

143
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,139
We're crawling around
there in the water,

144
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,975
and suddenly the Jap boat
starts dropping depth charges.

145
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,478
It's like the whole
ocean is exploding.

146
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,021
Something bumps into me.

147
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,023
A raft, empty.

148
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,984
So, I pull myself onto
it, heave my guts up...

149
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,858
Begging your pardon, ma'am.

150
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,989
Next thing I know, it's daylight.

151
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,991
There's no land in sight.

152
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,615
Guess that's about
it, till I hit here.

153
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,824
Thank God you were
spared, Mr. Allison.

154
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,379
Same goes for you, ma'am.

155
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,174
Well, I...

156
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,176
think I'll get a little rest now.

157
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,512
You'll be all right
here on the verandah?

158
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,432
- Oh, sure. Sure, ma'am.
- Good night, Mr. Allison.

159
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,135
Good night, ma'am.

160
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,158
That should do us, Mr. Allison.

161
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,968
I seen some bamboo over there.

162
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,970
I'm gonna go cut me a spear...

163
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,673
and spear some fish.

I seen a length of rope over
there by that shed. Go get it.

- We're gonna catch that turtle, ma'am.
- Are we, Mr. Allison?

00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,270
Yeah, and I'm gonna need
your help. Come on.

00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,745
- Four.
- That's the stuff. One.

184
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,247
(TOGETHER) Two. Three. Four.

185
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,875
Oh! One. Two.

186
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,418
Three. Four.

187
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,463
There he is, ma'am. Dead ahead.

188
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,964
Easy now.

189
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,293
Just let her drift.

190
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,601
(ALLISON) Got him.

191
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,148
Just like taking candy from a baby.

192
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,492
Oh!

193
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,320
Oh, Mr. Allison!

194
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,164
Oh!

195
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,164
Ooh, my. Oh.

196
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,694
Oh!

197
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,037
Oh!

198
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,339
Ma'am!

199
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,923
Turtle meat's kind of sticky, huh?

200
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:43,051
- But it's good.
- Mmm! It's delicious.

201
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,053
What is turtle anyway?

202
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,721
It ain't a fish.

203
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,807
It's, uh, it's a reptile.

204
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:52,060
- You mean like snake?
- Well, of the same family.

205
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,895
It's considered a great delicacy.

206
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,438
It's a gourmet's dish.

207
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,315
No kidding.

208
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,566
Whose dish?

209
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,236
A person who knows fine food.

210
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,529
Oh.

211
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:08,326
You know, with all the things there
are to eat on this island...

212
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,829
There's breadfruit,
mangoes, papaya,

213
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,165
not to mention the
fish in the sea...

214
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,000
There's no question
about us surviving.

215
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,961
We could go on here for years,

216
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,789
and I mean years.

217
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,678
You think it might come
to that, Mr. Allison?

218
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,473
Well, the way this war is going.

219
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:34,769
Well, isn't there any chance of
our own forces landing here?

220
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:39,023
Well, the brass planned to
bypass a lot of these islands...

221
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,942
on their way to Tokyo.

222
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,485
At least, that's the scuttlebutt.

223
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,821
Scuttle what?

224
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:47,241
Scuttlebutt. You know, the poop.

225
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,868
Poop.

226
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,828
Like, um, guys beating their gums,

227
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,872
you know, giving out
with the rumors.

228
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,542
Oh, yes, of course, rumors.

229
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:01,462
Well, they don't seem to beat
their gums on very hopeful poop,

230
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,381
do they, Mr. Allison?

231
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,335
No, ma'am, they don't.

232
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,974
How far do you figure
it is to Fiji, ma'am?

233
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:16,477
About 300 miles,
Father Phillips said.

234
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,980
Lots of water.

235
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,648
Due south, ain't they?

236
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,476
I believe so.

237
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,942
That's the way the wind's blowing.

238
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,195
Why, Mr. Allison?

239
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,950
Why, Mr. Allison?

240
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:44,505
Well, I was thinking...

241
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,925
but, no, ma'am, that would
be just plain crazy.

242
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,549
What would?

243
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,514
Trying to sail down
there in a raft.

244
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,850
Everything would be against
our making it, everything,

245
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,852
even if there weren't
Japs all around...

246
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,520
and we could sneak through them.

247
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,481
What I mean is that nobody
in their right minds...

248
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,483
would want to leave this place...

249
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,485
where's there's plenty
to eat and good water...

250
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,445
and go sailing off
to hell and gone...

251
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,030
begging your pardon, ma'am...

252
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:12,492
in a two-by-four rubber raft, and maybe
starve to death or die of thirst,

253
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,195
even if they didn't get drowned.

254
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:18,199
But you'd like to try.
Is that it, Mr. Allison?

255
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,042
Well, ma'am...

256
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,211
Of course you would.

257
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:26,506
No, if it was just me, okay,

258
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,841
but, uh, I couldn't ask you to go,

259
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:33,548
and I wouldn't leave you here,
so, uh, let's forget all about it.

260
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:38,094
What if I myself would
like to try, Mr. Allison?

261
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,894
I'd say you was crazy too, ma'am.

262
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:46,602
Thank you, Mr. Allison.

263
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,530
The raft would have
to have a rudder.

264
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,407
I'll figure out some way to fix it.

265
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:55,034
Could the sail be of palm?
I know how to thatch.

266
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,487
Good.

267
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,460
I sure hope you like fish, ma'am.

268
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,629
Because after about a week
when the fruit runs out,

269
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,589
there's going to be
nothing else but,

270
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,133
raw fish, at that.

271
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,969
And I'm sure I'll get used to it.

272
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,971
Oh, sure.

273
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,807
Now, that was a dope question.

274
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,143
It's a cinch you'd like fish,

275
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,267
with your religion and all.

276
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,441
You know, the guys in the corps,

277
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,901
the ones who go to see the chaplain
the night before an attack,

278
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,903
have to eat fish on Friday,

279
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,947
we call them mackerel snap...

280
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:41,122
What is it you call
them, Mr. Allison?

281
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,499
Huh? Who?

282
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,169
The ones who have to
eat fish on Fridays.

283
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,671
Oh, we call them, uh...

284
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,295
- Um...
- Is it mackerel snappers?

285
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:57,555
Yeah. Yeah, that's what
some of the guys call them.

286
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,308
But they're good marines,
ma'am, the best.

287
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,557
I'm glad to hear that.

288
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,689
Of what faith are you, Mr. Allison?

289
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,982
Huh?

290
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,318
What church did your
parents raise you in?

291
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,695
Oh, I didn't have no parents.
I was an orphanage kid.

292
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:16,157
You mean you never
knew your parents?

293
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,659
They died when you were little?

294
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,329
I mean there I was at the Allison
Street entrance one morning...

295
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,331
in an empty egg crate.

296
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,583
Allison Street, Milwaukee.

297
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,331
I figure I'm a...

298
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,331
I figure I'm illegitimate.

299
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:37,512
Well, what's the difference,
I say. I got born, didn't I?

300
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:40,848
Didn't they give you any religious
teaching in the orphanage?

301
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,350
Oh, sure.

302
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,353
Every Sunday, some skinny old
crack used to come around...

303
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:49,524
and go on about what cigarettes
will do to your insides and...

304
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,526
things.

305
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,445
But I broke out of
there when I was 14.

306
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,030
The next few years,

307
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,032
I seen the insides of more halls
of correction and jails...

308
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,034
than I did churches.

309
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,237
Then I joined the marines.

310
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,915
Now, you look at me, ma'am.

311
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:09,877
What do you see besides
a big, dumb guy?

312
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,587
I'll tell ya.

313
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,090
A marine, that's what I am.

314
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,467
All through me, a marine,

315
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,052
like you're a nun.

316
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:22,056
You got your cross. I got
my globe and anchor.

317
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,475
(LAUGHS)

318
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,477
It took a lot of working over,

319
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,396
but they're the ones could do it.

320
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,981
My first D.I....

321
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,483
That's, uh, drill
instructor, ma'am.

322
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,610
When I was a recruit, he
looks me up and down,

323
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,613
and he says, "Lad, I'm gonna
make you hate my guts.”

324
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,240
The old peep sight.

325
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,284
He sure kept his promise.

326
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,786
There were times I
wanted to commit murder.

327
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,997
Then I seen the light,

328
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,749
and I started being a marine.

329
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,210
Other guys, you know, most of them,

330
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,004
they got homes, families.

331
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:57,381
Me, I got the corps,
like you got the church.

332
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,511
Yes, I'm...

333
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,639
I'm sure they have
many things in common.

334
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,600
Yeah.

335
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,144
Yeah!

336
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,273
You should have known my D.I.

337
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,941
Your D.I., ma'am?

338
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,361
Yes. Sister Brigida, the
mistress of novices.

339
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,280
We had a name for her too.

340
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,983
Yeah, what was that?

341
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:24,118
We called her the...

342
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,321
The Holy Terror.

343
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:32,627
Um, not getting personal or
anything, ma'am, but, uh,

344
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,630
are you different from other nuns?

345
00:28:35,631 --> 00:28:38,633
I-I don't think so.

346
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:43,721
Well, uh, I never thought nuns
made with the jokes, you know.

347
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,306
No offense, ma'am.

348
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,976
Of course not.

349
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,312
I never thought there were
any pretty nuns either.

350
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,981
Ooh, you should've seen
Sister Mary Fidelis.

351
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,150
We took our novitiate together.

352
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,486
She was a model before she
joined the community.

353
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,030
Her face was in all the
fashion magazines.

354
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,323
Yeah?

355
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:06,452
Sister Mary Fidelis was the
loveliest girl I ever saw.

356
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,829
Well, what did she
want to be a nun for?

357
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,541
Because it gave her greater
happiness than anything else.

358
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,253

00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,463
Well, maybe there are some...

360
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,383

wanting to be a marine.

Can't tell. Maybe.

366

Oh, I am sorry, Mr. Allison.

367
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,507

pushed you down like that?

368

- Oh, no, no, no.
- He's coming back.

369
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:07,972
He's doing a recon job, like
giving this place the once-over.

370
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,433
For what reason, do you think?

371
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:13,019
I don't know. Nothing good.

372
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:17,023
You know, the other day when we
was up there, I spotted a cave.

373
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:21,110
Might not be a bad idea for us to spend
the next few nights in that cave,

374
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,939
till we get that raft
finished and shove off.

it cut off like that, huh?

01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:03,195
changed her mind, you know?

601
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,281
She didn't want to
be a nun anymore.

602
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:07,366

603

lightly, Mr. Allison.

sea battle, maybe we won it.

712
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,575
That's why the Japanese pulled out.

713
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,994
In which case, it's our guys'
turn to clobber the island.

714
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:52,372
Would they make a
landing afterward?

715
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:53,790
It figures.

716
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,168
Do you think they'll come soon?

717
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:58,295
Ought to be right away.

718
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:00,005
Oh.

719
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:02,632
Oh, I hope.

720
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:05,177
I hope.

721
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:14,058
Ma'am, I just got to tell you.

722
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,347
What?

723
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:21,568
When you go back home again,
ma'am, don't do it, huh? Please.

724
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:23,237
Please don't.

725
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,865
Don't do what?

726
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:31,036
Don't take those vows,
those... those final ones.

727
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:33,990
Don't do it, huh, ma'am?

728
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:39,878
I, um,

729
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:44,425
I never loved anything
or anybody before.

730
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,552
I never even lived before,

731
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:51,556
not... really lived...

732
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,430
inside.

733
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:56,102
So, uh,

734
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:59,022
that's why I want to
ask you to marry me.

735
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:02,609
I want to look after you,

736
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:05,487
not only while we're here, but, uh,

737
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:07,361
for the rest of our lives.

738
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:14,246
I couldn't keep from
saying it, ma'am.

739
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:15,949
So, uh,

740
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,251
tell me...

741
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:22,080
i-if there's a chance, huh?

742
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,881
I-I don't mean to give
offense, ma'am, but, uh,

743
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:30,637
is there?

744
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:34,474
No, Mr. Allison.

745
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:39,062
You see, I've already
given my heart...

746
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,140
to Christ, our Lord.

747
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:47,109
You mean like you was
engaged or something?

748
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:50,153
Yes.

749
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:54,487
This is the ring.

750
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:59,457
And when I make my final vows,

751
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:01,793
I'll wear a gold one,

752
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:03,792
a marriage ring.

753
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:09,342
Oh, I... I didn't know.

754
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:14,014
I didn't know it was
set up like that. I...

755
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:17,014
I guess I didn't have
no right to speak.

756
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:26,527
Well, guess I'll go, uh,
fix that lean-to for you.

757
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,135
Hello, ma'am.

758
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:37,555
Well, no sign of 'em yet.

759
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:39,391
Our guys, I mean.

760
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:41,226
But you do think they're coming?

761
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:42,811
They've got to.

762
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:47,813
Of course, uh, nothing's
certain in this crazy war.

763
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:50,777
Ma'am.

764
01:14:50,778 --> 01:14:53,196
Yes, Mr. Allison.

765
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:56,533
I must have been off
my rocker last night.

766
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:58,952
A marine oughtn't to get married.

767
01:14:58,953 --> 01:15:01,246
That ain't fair to his
family or the corps.

768
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,790
One of them's gotta
get the short end.

769
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:05,583
Like just before an attack,

770
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:08,294
he asks himself which is better...

771
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:10,005
A dead husband or a bad marine?

772
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:12,257
He ends up both.

773
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:16,011
Even a peacetime
marriage ain't no good.

774
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:18,096
A marine gets sent
all over the world.

775
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:20,265
What I mean, there's all
kinds of temptations.

776
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:22,726
So, uh, it's better, you know,

777
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,811
that he ain't tied down-like.

778
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:27,605
You do me a favor, huh, ma'am?

779
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:31,109
Just, uh, forget I
opened my big mouth.

780
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:34,029
Certainly, Mr. Allison.

781
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:36,257
(OBJECT CLANKS)

(CLANKING)

783
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:23,847
The rice'll be ready in a minute.

784
01:17:23,848 --> 01:17:27,809
Look, Mr. Allison, what I
found in the rice sack.

785
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:30,645
It has a most peculiar odor.

786
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,814
I wonder what it could be.

787
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:35,316
Well, ma'am, I'll tell you.

788
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:38,027
That's, uh, sake.

789
01:17:38,028 --> 01:17:41,156
It's, uh, kind of a Japanese drink.

790
01:17:41,157 --> 01:17:43,575
Oh, yes. Sake.

791
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:47,036
It, uh... isn't that the
wine made from rice?

792
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:48,580
Well, it's kind of like wine,

793
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:51,332
yeah, ma'am, only a
little bit stronger.

794
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,710
Will you have one with me?

795
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:55,211
Well, uh,

796
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:56,671
perhaps

797
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,795
Just a small one.

798
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:04,634
Here's how.

799
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:06,632
How.

800
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:17,609
Oh. Yes, it is strong, isn't it?

801
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:19,938
Oh.

802
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:22,815
Ohh.

803
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:56,640
Mr. Allison, what's the matter?

804
01:18:59,026 --> 01:19:02,526
Matter? Nothing's the matter.

805
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:06,025
What makes you think
something's the matter?

806
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:11,664
Well, you... You haven't
eaten anything.

807
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:15,079
Haven't I?

808
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:18,670
Mr. Allison.

809
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:24,217
Don't you think you...
you've had enough sake?

810
01:19:24,218 --> 01:19:26,469
No, ma'am.

811
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:29,389

What'd you want to be a nun for?

817
01:19:57,751 --> 01:20:00,545
Mr. Allison,

818
01:20:00,546 --> 01:20:01,918
please.

819
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,672
It's just my luck.

820
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:09,346
That's old Allison's luck.

821
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:16,936
If you have to be a nun, why
aren't you old and ugly?

822
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:18,896
Huh?

823
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:22,734
Mr. Allison, I-I think
I've mastered this...

824
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:25,445
This Japanese game.

825
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:27,905
It's a little like draughts.

826
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:30,908
Why do you have to
have big blue eyes...

827
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:33,737
and a beautiful smile?

828
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:37,575
And freckles.

829
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:44,630
Did you ever play draughts?

830
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:46,841
No, ma'am. Only craps.

831
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:49,260
Craps. Acey-deucey.

832
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:52,180
Well, then I'll teach you.
It's quite simple.

833
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:55,433
Now, then, you're
white, and I'm black.

834
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:58,770
The object of the game is
to take each other's men.

835
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:02,190
That's all old Allison needs,

836
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:04,275
a game of draughts.

837
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:06,277
That'll fix everything up.

838
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:08,196
You don't want to play?

839
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:11,321
No, ma'am. I mean, yes, ma'am.

840
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:14,285
I mean...

841
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:18,832
I don't want to play
no game of draughts.

842
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:23,461
Yes. Well, then in that case,

843
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:25,505
I think I'll say good night.

844
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:28,922

loved this pipe.

What good is it without tobacco?

850
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:08,506
Let me tell you something, ma'am.

851
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:12,260
We're gonna be on this
island for years and years.

852
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:13,928
Till the war's over anyway.

853
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:17,515
If our guys were coming, they
would've been here by now.

What I mean, we been bypassed.

855
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:22,520
Have we, Mr. Allison?

856
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:25,690
It's just you and me, see?

857
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:29,527
Now, what's the point your being
a nun if we're all alone?

858
01:22:29,528 --> 01:22:30,900
Answer me that.

859

'Cause there ain't no point.

What would you do all day, pray?

862
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:44,417
And I, uh, I'd drill, I guess, huh?

863
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:46,043
I can see that.

and you leave the rest to Allison.

1064
01:39:25,835 --> 01:39:28,336
Mr. Allison, are you sure
it's God you're obeying...

1065
01:39:28,337 --> 01:39:31,757
and not your own natural desire
to take part in the fighting?

1066
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:35,177
Pretty sure, ma'am.

1067
01:39:35,178 --> 01:39:37,722
Then he'll protect you.

1068
01:39:54,614 --> 01:40:00,071
(EXPLOSIONS)

1069
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:26,053
(EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE)

1070
01:40:48,459 --> 01:40:49,660
(SCREAMS)

1071
01:41:34,547 --> 01:41:36,545
(SPLASHES)

1072
01:41:57,653 --> 01:42:00,572
(GUNFIRE)

1073
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:11,076
Well, mission accomplished,
like they say, ma'am.

1074
01:42:12,043 --> 01:42:13,084
Ooh.

1075
01:42:13,085 --> 01:42:16,046
I ain't killed, nothin'.

1076
01:42:16,047 --> 01:42:19,501
Ooh. Ooh, lie down, Mr. Allison.

1077
01:42:29,435 --> 01:42:31,394
(GUNFIRE)

1078
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:33,104
Small arms.

1079
01:42:33,105 --> 01:42:35,357
They're ashore.

1080
01:42:35,358 --> 01:42:37,692
Come on, marines.

1081
01:42:37,693 --> 01:42:39,440
Hubba-hubba.

1082
01:42:41,656 --> 01:42:44,741
Ma'am, we're coming to the
end of our time together.

1083
01:42:44,742 --> 01:42:46,993
Oh, we'll be seeing each
other on and off...

1084
01:42:46,994 --> 01:42:49,287
for the next couple
of days maybe, but...

1085
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:52,248
it won't ever be just the
two of us again, so...

1086
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:54,451
I'd like to say this now.

1087
01:42:59,048 --> 01:43:02,133
Very pleased to have
met you, ma'am.

1088
01:43:02,134 --> 01:43:03,927
It was a...

1089
01:43:03,928 --> 01:43:05,880
privilege to know you.

1090
01:43:06,847 --> 01:43:10,051
I wish you ev-every happiness.

1091
01:43:15,022 --> 01:43:16,519
Good-bye.

1092
01:43:20,945 --> 01:43:23,489
Good-bye, Mr. Allison.

1093
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:29,035
No matter how many
miles apart we are...

1094
01:43:29,036 --> 01:43:32,580
or whether I ever get
to see your face again,

1095
01:43:32,581 --> 01:43:36,084
you will be my dear
companion always.

1096
01:43:36,085 --> 01:43:37,753
Always.

1097
01:43:46,846 --> 01:43:49,014
Hey, marine, you got a cigarette?

1098
01:44:06,907 --> 01:44:08,575
I don't get it, Cap'n.

1099
01:44:08,576 --> 01:44:11,870
Four howitzers, plenty of
ammo, no breechblocks.

1100
01:44:11,871 --> 01:44:14,456
- They haven't fired a round.
- Beats me.

1101
01:44:14,457 --> 01:44:16,159
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

1102
01:44:27,178 --> 01:44:28,880
