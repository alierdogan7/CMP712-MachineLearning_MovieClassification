506
00:48:35,528 --> 00:48:37,496
ass-fucked us, and we
slept right through it,

507
00:48:37,563 --> 00:48:41,232
despite having two people
on watch all night.

508
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,135
Are you saying that
cars drove by us and
we didn't even notice?

509
00:48:44,203 --> 00:48:46,204
MARCUS: That's right.
- Staff Sergeant,
don't you think it's likely

510
00:48:46,272 --> 00:48:47,305
we're just in
the wrong place?

511
00:48:47,373 --> 00:48:49,073
We are not in
the wrong place.

512
00:48:49,141 --> 00:48:52,043
We are exactly where
we're supposed to be,
which is where they left us.

513
00:48:52,111 --> 00:48:55,113
So from now on, one person
is outside at all times.

514
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,949
You will walk out
as far as you can,
in three separate directions

515
00:48:58,017 --> 00:48:59,785
keeping the house
in your sights.

516
00:48:59,852 --> 00:49:01,787
You want us to stand out
in the desert all day?

517
00:49:01,854 --> 00:49:03,488
You can't ask us to do that.

518
00:49:03,556 --> 00:49:05,857
I'm not asking you
to do a goddamn thing,
Anderson. I'm telling you.

519
00:49:05,925 --> 00:49:09,127
It's a direct fucking order,
and you will carry it out.

520
00:49:09,194 --> 00:49:10,495
Now move!

521
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:14,833
Move!

522
00:50:32,545 --> 00:50:33,645
Tino.

523
00:50:34,413 --> 00:50:35,547
Tino.

524
00:51:34,273 --> 00:51:36,240
You know, this is
bullshit, right?

525
00:51:36,308 --> 00:51:38,977
Marcus is fucking
losing it, man.

526
00:51:39,045 --> 00:51:42,047
Must be some delayed
PTSD or some shit.

527
00:51:42,882 --> 00:51:44,849
Yeah. About the truck.

528
00:51:44,917 --> 00:51:46,017
Yeah?

529
00:51:46,886 --> 00:51:48,987
Whoever did that

530
00:51:49,055 --> 00:51:52,624
has got to be somewhere nearby
to know we're here, right?

531
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:56,761
Maybe they're hiding
somewhere in the desert,

532
00:51:56,829 --> 00:52:00,164
and here we are,
separated into teams.

533
00:52:00,232 --> 00:52:01,499
Somebody could be
watching us,

534
00:52:01,567 --> 00:52:04,035
and we wouldn't even
fucking know it.

535
00:52:04,103 --> 00:52:07,806
Man, I'm telling you,
it had to be that
girl who was here.

536
00:52:07,873 --> 00:52:11,275
All right, you telling me
she busted into our
Humvee ignition system?

537
00:52:11,343 --> 00:52:16,147
Come on, man. Al-Qaeda's
got training camps all
over this sandbox, right?

538
00:52:16,215 --> 00:52:17,682
The girl, huh?

539
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:18,984
Yeah, brother.

540
00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:22,120
Well, we'll see about that.

Hey, can we go
back inside, please?

his glasses or some shit.

be dark soon.

We're not going back inside
until we find our translator.

553
00:54:10,763 --> 00:54:14,632

What happened to his eyes?

You might want to
shut that light off.

No. We wait.

Hey, calm down, Tino.
Jorge was with me all day.

killed Wilcox.

keep an eye on you.

this house and look out
for the enemy,

807
01:21:51,272 --> 01:21:52,773

fully forthcoming

Okay.

813
01:22:08,389 --> 01:22:10,157
Your squad was
stationed on a patrol

814
01:22:10,224 --> 01:22:14,560
during which time
your communications
systems went down.

815
01:22:14,628 --> 01:22:19,166
Shortly thereafter, you
were attacked by a group
of al-Qaeda fighters,

816
01:22:19,233 --> 01:22:21,567
about 30 of them.

I think we can
take care of you.

All right, you sit tight.
