00:26:54,694 --> 00:26:57,954

because if you go in the drink,

Now up on the land
by some evolutionary accident,

443
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:23,555
we developed these big brains,
and we invented weapons.

444
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,243
So we got used to being
at the top of the food chain,

445
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:29,602
but once you step
in that saltwater,

446
00:27:29,637 --> 00:27:32,482
right back to the bottom
of the food chain.

447
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:36,515
Even if you swim well,
we look pathetic to sharks.

448
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:40,706
They think were wounded,
split up the middle, you know?

449
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:44,547

teeth and jaws...

If anyone
was coming to save us,

1038
01:10:49,698 --> 01:10:51,200
they would've
been here by now.

1039
01:10:51,235 --> 01:10:55,232
An island has been spotted
a few miles away.

1040
01:10:55,267 --> 01:10:56,672
That's impossible.

1041
01:10:56,707 --> 01:10:59,040
We're somewhere
in the Philippine Sea.

1042
01:10:59,075 --> 01:11:01,120
You don't know
where we are.

1043
01:11:01,155 --> 01:11:02,785
We're going to catch
a current,

1044
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,159
and we're gonna ride it over
to that island.

1045
01:11:04,194 --> 01:11:06,017
The captain would want us
to stay together.

1046
01:11:06,052 --> 01:11:08,641
The Captain is dead,
you understand?

1047
01:11:08,676 --> 01:11:10,016
I am in charge now.

You, come on over.

1052
01:11:21,474 --> 01:11:24,899
Obviously, we can't take
anyone who's bleeding.

1053
01:11:27,011 --> 01:11:29,215
I'm sorry, chap.

1054
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:31,779
I promised my mama
I'd come home safe.

1055
01:11:36,771 --> 01:11:39,873
Come on, men,
swim on over.

1056
01:11:39,908 --> 01:11:44,032
And, Waxman, I'm going to leave you
in charge of the wounded.

1057
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:45,889

troublemakers over there
