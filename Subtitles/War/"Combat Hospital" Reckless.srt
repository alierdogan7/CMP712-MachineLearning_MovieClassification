3
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:11,390
Take your places please,

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:16,450
this contest is going to
begin in T-5 minutes.

5
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:19,259
Our first team,

6
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:22,732
their always there in a pinch.
Fighting for freedom, the queen,

7
00:00:22,852 --> 00:00:25,559
and their right to boil
their beef.

8
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:29,813
They are team Britain!

9
00:00:29,898 --> 00:00:32,015
(Cheering)

10
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,817
♪

11
00:00:33,852 --> 00:00:35,986
You better run!
You better hide!

12
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,273
It's team Australia!

13
00:00:39,324 --> 00:00:41,158
(Cheering)

14
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:42,096
We would've won. 

15
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:43,691
- We eat that for a snack, man.
- That's right. We would've won.

16
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:45,662
Hey, you guys, where are
you going? Wrong direction.

17
00:00:45,747 --> 00:00:47,314
- Party's that way.
- Uh, we just got beeped.

18
00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:48,849
We gotta be in Hutal
by nightfall.

19
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:50,000
Hey, have you seen Bobby?

20
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:51,618
'Cause I bet him
a week's worth of coffee that

21
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:53,453
the Canadians were gonna beat
the Americans under the table.

22
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:54,888
(Chuckles and scoffs)

23
00:00:54,956 --> 00:00:56,940
The way our team's chowing down,
you're gonna lose that money.

24
00:00:57,008 --> 00:00:57,991
Okay, the U.S. may have

25
00:00:58,059 --> 00:00:59,960
a higher obesity rate
than Canada,

26
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:01,061
but we know how to eat kebabs.

27
00:01:01,112 --> 00:01:02,162
(Chuckles)
Douche bags.

28
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,363
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Ray. How's it going?

29
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:05,149
The beautiful
Dr. Rebecca Gordon.

30
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,918
(Kisses) Mm. Marry me. I will
take you away from all of this.

31
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:10,137
We'll settle in Florida,
have a whole lot of babies.

32
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:12,739
Hmm.
I think that I'll stick

33
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:14,825
with trauma surgery
in Kandahar.

34
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:15,843
(Chuckles)
Well...

35
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,244
- Burn! (Laughs)
- Burn! (Chuckles)

36
00:01:17,364 --> 00:01:19,479
Dr. Rebecca,
I'm in a bit of a bind here.

37
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:20,947
Hmm.

38
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,449
Uh, long story short, we have
a hell of a stretch to Hutal,

39
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:24,334
and I need me some go.

40
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:25,485
"Go"?

41
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:28,488
As in pill-poppin',
"need for speed" kind of go?

42
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:29,640
Mm.

43
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:31,058
That is for your flight surgeon
to deal with.

44
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,260
Yeah, he's all the way
across base,

45
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:34,528
but you are right here,

46
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:36,263
and the pharmacy
is just inches away.

47
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:38,899
I'm sorry. Ray, I don't feel
comfortable handing out

48
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:41,235
a heavy-duty stimulant like candy.
(Sighs)

49
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:42,686
Are you serious?
This is standard stuff,

50
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,438
plus, we are
practically engaged here.

51
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:48,380
No, we are nowhere near engaged,
and the answer is still no.

52
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,010
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:52,746
Hey. Hey, look, if...
If you need some downtime...

54
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,249
You know what?
Just forget I asked.

55
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,985
Enjoy your kebabs.

56
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:02,289
(Cheering)

57
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,042
(Graham, voice amplified)
Yes, can you believe how fast

58
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,044
these contestants are slamming
those little pieces of piggy

59
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:08,295
down their throat?

60
00:02:08,363 --> 00:02:11,098
And the first person is France
to slow down,

61
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:12,132
and she is out!

62
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:14,184
Deutschland has had too much.

63
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:15,736
Australia is still in,

64
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,639
and the Canadian
is still going strong,

65
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,307
and America is out!

66
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:21,391
Yeah!

67
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:22,976
(Cheering)

68
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:25,696
And the Netherlands drops out!

69
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,316
Deutschland and Hungary
not so <i>hungry</i> anymore,

70
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:31,785
but Romania and Canada still
going strong.

71
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,370
Romania...

72
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:34,454
Romania looks...

73
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,823
and no, he is over.
He is out!

74
00:02:36,874 --> 00:02:37,991
We have a winner...

75
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,078
The Canadian
from the Kabul base!

76
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,829
(Cheering)

77
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:44,581
Oh!

78
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:45,532
Whoo!

79
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:51,204
I say, to hell with country
and base battles,

80
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:52,806
'cause I...

81
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,225
am repping the estrogen empire!

82
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,578
(Cheering)

83
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:03,150
Whoo! What do I win, sir?

84
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:04,818
You have won
this fetching blue ribbon.

85
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,270
May I pin it on you?

86
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:08,455
(Cheering)
Wow. Thanks.

87
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:10,457
Wait, wait. What about
the guy in the tower?

88
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:13,060
Are we doing this,
or are we doing this?

89
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:15,612
(Clatters)

90
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:16,563
Really?

91
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,615
Yeah. (Chuckles)
Let's go.

92
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,834
Get up here now.
Come on!

93
00:03:20,885 --> 00:03:22,535
Ohh.
(Grunts)

94
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:25,188
Come here. Come here.

95
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:26,923
(Chuckles) Mm.

96
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:28,008
Mm.

97
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:28,976
Wait, wait, wait. Shh.

98
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,010
Ohh.
I think I heard someone.

99
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:31,344
No, you didn't.

100
00:03:31,362 --> 00:03:33,997
You didn't hear Marks
or Will or anyone else,

101
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:35,716
so...

102
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:37,250
Ooh. Hey, hey. Yeah.

103
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:38,635
Ooh, yeah. Thank you.

104
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:39,770
No, thank you.

105
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:41,171
Ohh.

106
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,890
Why is it that you're
everywhere work isn't?

107
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:45,025
Oh, come now, Rebecca.

108
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:46,960
A man who spends all day
on the rumor mill...

109
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:49,529
He deserves some sort
of respite, doesn't he?

110
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:53,467
God, you are just all walls
and wisecracks, aren't you?

111
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:54,384
Yeah.

112
00:03:54,452 --> 00:03:56,720
Well...

113
00:03:56,804 --> 00:04:00,691
I'm not exactly alone behind
the great wall now, am I?

114
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:02,492
You spend all hours of the night
jogging around the base

115
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,528
like you're being chased.

116
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,113
Why exactly?

117
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:15,072
(Retches)

118
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:17,057
Mm.
That's gonna be a problem.

119
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:18,191
(Jet engines roaring)

120
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,761
Yeah, more than you know.
That's the chef.

121
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:21,812
(Indistinct conversations)

122
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,363
(Coughs)

123
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:24,998
Mm.

124
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:26,132
Mm.

125
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:27,934
The whole "no sex on base" rule...
(Panting)

126
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:29,536
Marks doesn't take it
seriously, right?

127
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:32,172
No, he takes everything
seriously.

128
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,824
We could get kicked off base
for this?

129
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:34,908
We could roll over
an I.E.D.

130
00:04:34,976 --> 00:04:36,426
and get shipped home
in a coffin.

131
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:38,344
That's comforting.

132
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:40,564
Mm. (Laughs)

133
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:42,299
Ohh.
It's Kandahar, Bobby.

134
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,584
Every day is a risk.

135
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,053
So the question is,

136
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,355
you want to take this risk
with me?

137
00:04:48,423 --> 00:04:50,157
(Pager beeping)

138
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:51,324
Ohh.

139
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:52,292
(Second pager beeping)

140
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,777
(Sighs)
Oh, no. Gotta go.

141
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:54,728
(Beeping stops)
(Sighs)

142
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:56,413
Gotta go.

143
00:04:56,481 --> 00:04:57,714
- Mm.
- Where's my shirt?

144
00:04:57,782 --> 00:05:00,167
(Panting) - Here. Swap.
- Here.

145
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:01,935
Is that mine or yours?
That's yours. No, that's yours.

146
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:05,772
(Retching)

147
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,927
Just wait there.
I'm gonna get to you.

148
00:05:10,995 --> 00:05:12,712
(Retches)

149
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,214
(Marks)
Shrapnel rips through walls...

150
00:05:14,873 --> 00:05:16,750
Everyone's fine.
(Ring)

151
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:19,152
One cook with gastro
grills meat...

152
00:05:19,203 --> 00:05:20,520
Role 3 task force, Kandahar
South. Corday speaking.

153
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:21,755
I lose half the base.

154
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:22,722
A 9-liner?

155
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,673
Thank you.

156
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,159
Downed chopper?

157
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:27,360
Is it one of ours?

158
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,695
Make up as many bottles

159
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:30,747
of oral rehydration solution
as possible.

160
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:33,166
Okay, so it's, uh,
bacterial, not viral?

161
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:34,267
Most likely.

162
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,103
Symptoms came on
two hours after exposure.

163
00:05:36,154 --> 00:05:38,038
We're still waiting
on the cultures.

164
00:05:38,106 --> 00:05:39,038
Okay.

165
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,173
Did we page everyone?

166
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:41,141
Yeah, if they're not puking
their guts out,

167
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,375
they're on their feet
helping out,

168
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:44,611
except for Bobby, Suzy,
and Simon.

169
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:45,946
Yeah, well...
(Graham) Colonel.

170
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,165
Have an incoming 9-liner.
Downed chopper 91.

171
00:05:48,249 --> 00:05:50,016
Three injured.
No other information.

172
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:51,017
Did they say who?

173
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:52,419
All I know is,
Ray's bringing it in.

174
00:05:52,487 --> 00:05:54,121
Uh, TOC's still trying
to decipher the details.

175
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,622
E.T.A.'s about 30 minutes.

176
00:05:55,673 --> 00:05:56,690
Which means
the investigative team

177
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:57,958
will be here in 31 minutes.

178
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,092
Listen, I want everyone
to cooperate.

179
00:05:59,143 --> 00:06:01,161
They're gonna be asking
a lot of questions.

180
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:02,796
Some of it may seem invasive,

181
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:05,498
but remember, these men are just
trying to do their job.

182
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,933
Cockroaches.

183
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:09,102
We'll get the ready room prepped
for our ailing kebab friends.

184
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,270
We're gonna want to bring in

185
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:12,205
the flight surgeon
for this 9-liner.

186
00:06:12,273 --> 00:06:14,040
Call Ben-Meir.

187
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,143
(Clears throat and retches)

188
00:06:16,194 --> 00:06:17,794
Et tu, Graham?

189
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,279
(Coughs and gasps)

190
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:21,481
(Strained voice) Oh.
I'm sorry, sir.

191
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,066
Ohh.
I'm gonna be fine, sir.

192
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:25,252
No, you're not fine.
You're off duty as of now.

193
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,486
No, no, no. Sir, please.

194
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:27,921
Oh, I haven't missed
a day's work in my life.

195
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,489
You've gotta give me
something to do.

196
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:31,274
(Sighs)

197
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:34,461
All right. There's a patient
in Major Pedersen's office

198
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:35,795
she got the worst of it,
and I want to make sure that

199
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,397
she keeps hydrated.
Think you can handle that?

200
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:38,298
(Strained voice)
Yes, sir. I can handle that.

201
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:39,299
All right.

202
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:40,667
(Grunts)

203
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,535
Go. Something wrong with
your pager there, doctor?

204
00:06:42,587 --> 00:06:43,803
No, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.

205
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:44,905
All right.
Just help with the solutions.

206
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:45,989
Yes, sir.

207
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:49,075
All right.
Where the hell is Dr. Hill?!

208
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:50,677
(Retches)

209
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,012
I'll, uh, I'll get that.

210
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,846
(Marks)
We're missing Dr. Hill!

211
00:06:53,898 --> 00:06:55,649
Oh, Rebecca, can you pass me
a bottle of lytes?

212
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,016
Uh, yeah. Sure thing.

213
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:58,818
Let me hold it.
You go.

214
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,819
(Man retches)

215
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:00,820
Uh, Suzy?

216
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:01,788
Mm-hmm.

217
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,857
You got a little...

218
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:06,660
Oh. That explains
the whistles.

219
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:09,362
(Jet engines roaring)

220
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,048
(Retches)

221
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:14,167
Oh. All right.

222
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:17,637
(Grunts)

223
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:18,572
(Knock on door)

224
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,506
(Vans)
Hello? Dr. Hill?

225
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:21,141
He's not home.

226
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:22,993
(Man) ♪ but in anger,
not in fear ♪

227
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:25,478
♪ for when your day is done ♪

228
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:26,746
♪ oh ♪

229
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:28,982
(Sighs)
Did I say, "come in"?

230
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,784
Colonel Marks is looking
for you.

231
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,419
Yelling for you, actually.

232
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,971
Are those what I think
they are?

233
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,007
Yes. <i>Adorare italia.</i>

234
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:38,558
(Sighs)
<i>Vive les Francaises.</i>

235
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,644
And on that note, au revoir.

236
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:42,362
But everyone is vomiting.
They need help with cleanup.

237
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,130
Look, it's below
my pay grade, okay?

238
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:46,766
So tell Colonel Marks
I send my regrets,

239
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,886
and I also have this bug
that's buzzing around.

240
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:52,872
And in the meantime, you can
be my agent in absentia.

241
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,324
Your what?

242
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:56,243
I authorize you to speak
on my behalf.

243
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,295
I give you
my power of attorney,

244
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,330
so go.
Good-bye. Good luck.

245
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,451
(Knocks on door)

246
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:05,452
(Groans)

247
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,686
Excuse me.

248
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,771
Colonel Marks asked me

249
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,773
to look in on you
for a little while.

250
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:12,359
Ohh.

251
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,194
(Panting) Ohh.

252
00:08:14,262 --> 00:08:15,745
Oh, it's you.

253
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:18,615
Hey, you... you don't have to,
if you don't...

254
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:21,401
No, no, no.
It's okay.

255
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:22,669
(Sighs)

256
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,888
I think I just threw up
a French fry from 1988.

257
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:25,889
(Laughs)

258
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,390
(Coughs and laughs)

259
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:28,825
(Exhales deeply)
(Panting) Ohh.

260
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,393
You got it, too?

261
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:32,779
You know me and kebabs.

262
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,665
Ohh.

263
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:36,967
Ohh.
Yeah.

264
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:38,351
No, no, no. Don't.
Don't do that.

265
00:08:38,402 --> 00:08:40,635
- Don't vomit. If you vomit, I will vomit.
- Ohh. (Exhales deeply)

266
00:08:40,755 --> 00:08:44,391
(Panting)

267
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,160
(Coughs)

268
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:48,011
(Gulps)

269
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,529
I'm good.

270
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,498
Ohh.

271
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:53,266
(Exhxhes deeply)

272
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:54,768
(Panting)

273
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,236
Are you gonna be okay
with this?

274
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,438
Sure. Come on.

275
00:08:58,506 --> 00:09:03,410
Not every day
I get to spend puking...

276
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,445
with my ex-husband.

277
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,883
All right. Any other symptoms
other than your stomach?

278
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,685
(German accent)
I have a bad, bad headache.

279
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:14,521
Uh, well, you know,
bad headaches are not uncommon.

280
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:15,621
You know what?
How about... here we go.

281
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:17,173
Can I get one of those, nurse?

282
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:18,792
Drink one of these,
uh, get some good rest,

283
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,644
and you'll be great
in about a day or two.

284
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:22,862
- You're good. Come on.
(Bobby) - What are you doing here?

285
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,181
There we go. Oh, man.
Just feeling a little out of sorts.

286
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:26,883
(Bobby) Okay. Well, if your
insides aren't flying out,

287
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:28,735
then consider yourself
a lucky man.

288
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:31,905
I'm getting luckier
by the second.

289
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:34,040
Bobby, I can finish up here.

290
00:09:36,277 --> 00:09:37,777
All right, listen up!

291
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,112
Choppers have landed.

292
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,414
One bravo, two alphas.

293
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:42,582
Which T.T.L.s are free?

294
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:43,717
Uh, we're done here.

295
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:44,734
All right.

296
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:46,302
- I'll get bay 2 ready, sir.
- Okay, good.

297
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:47,637
- We'll take the bravo over there.
- Yes, sir.

298
00:09:47,722 --> 00:09:48,822
All right?

299
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,189
The alphas will have to wait,
if need be.

300
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:51,074
No solids for the next
24 hours, all right?

301
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:52,242
- Yeah.
- You'll be fine.

302
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:53,793
- Ohh.
- Hey.

303
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,929
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Oh! Hey!

304
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,896
Bobby, take him to I.C.U.
(Groans)

305
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:57,914
Figure out what's wrong
with him.

306
00:09:57,982 --> 00:09:59,232
(Moaning)

307
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:00,450
Okay.

308
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:02,135
All right. You've had
T.T.L. experience, right?

309
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:03,870
- Yes, sir.
- Take bay 1.

310
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,755
Colonel, thank you
for calling me.

311
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,840
You're the flight surgeon.

312
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:08,375
We got a pilot coming in.
Take bay 2.

313
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,309
Yes, sir.

314
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,710
All right.

315
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:13,897
All right.
I need five med techs.

316
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:16,349
(Siren whoops)

317
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,334
Come this way.

318
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:35,418
Hang in there, son.

319
00:10:35,503 --> 00:10:37,787
Bravo. Bay 2!

320
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:39,839
Okay, people, they're here!

321
00:10:42,626 --> 00:10:44,711
B.P. 70 over palp.
Pulse 140.

322
00:10:44,762 --> 00:10:45,845
Intubated in the field.

323
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,964
Extensive burns...
Face, arms, right leg.

324
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:50,750
Possible internal injuries.
Broken right femur.

325
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,251
Start him on Ringers.

326
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:53,853
Punch in the parkland formula.

327
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:55,271
Let's get him fully exposed

328
00:10:55,356 --> 00:10:56,973
so we can evaluate
all his injuries.

329
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,275
I need x-rays and ultrasound
on this patient,

330
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,027
and I need them now.

331
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:01,961
(Gasps)

332
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,864
It's Ray.

333
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:06,783
Ford and Mehra.

334
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:09,230
(Marks)
Trauma 1. Alpha!

335
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:17,038
Get Mehra inside.

336
00:11:17,106 --> 00:11:18,773
All right. B.P. 130 over 80.
Pulse 112.

337
00:11:18,824 --> 00:11:21,542
Minor lac... face and hands.
Hematoma right leg.

338
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,245
Fentanyl lollipop given
in the field.

339
00:11:25,814 --> 00:11:28,716
Ford, stay with me.
You're gonna be all right, son.

340
00:11:28,784 --> 00:11:31,185
(Electronic chirping)

341
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,372
B.P. 140 over 80.
Pulse 110.

342
00:11:34,456 --> 00:11:36,307
Right shoulder dislocation.

343
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:38,592
Laceration lower right arm.

344
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,527
He's going to need
escharotomies.

345
00:11:40,578 --> 00:11:41,411
O.R. 2 is ready.

346
00:11:41,496 --> 00:11:43,130
No time.
We'll do it here.

347
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:44,431
Rebecca, how's Mehra?

348
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:45,766
Stable for now.

349
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,618
Take over here.

350
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:49,569
(Rebecca) Hang in there, Mehra.
Hang in there, okay?

351
00:11:49,637 --> 00:11:51,199
You're in good hands now.

352
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:53,239
We got you.

353
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:57,261
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

354
00:11:57,345 --> 00:12:00,180
The E.T. tube doesn't have
good placement.

355
00:12:00,248 --> 00:12:01,148
It must have dislodged.

356
00:12:01,215 --> 00:12:02,849
(Beeping continues)

357
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:04,117
Can't get good placement.

358
00:12:04,168 --> 00:12:05,552
There's too much swelling
in the soft tissue.

359
00:12:05,603 --> 00:12:06,937
(Beeping continues)

360
00:12:07,021 --> 00:12:08,755
Bay 3, Rebecca.
Right now.

361
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:12,259
(Monitor beeping erratically)

362
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:13,393
We need to cric him.

363
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:17,597
(Beeping continues)

364
00:12:19,951 --> 00:12:21,969
(Ben-Meir)
V-fib. We're losing him.

365
00:12:22,036 --> 00:12:23,737
Get the crash cart.

366
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:28,675
Check pulse. Start C.P.R.

367
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:33,618
(Pants)

368
00:12:33,944 --> 00:12:35,082
Stop C.P.R.

369
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,001
(Defibrillator whines)

370
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:38,886
Charge 200. Clear?

371
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:39,854
Clear.

372
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:41,789
(Paddles thunk)

373
00:12:44,442 --> 00:12:46,210
(Ben-Meir) Get me 40 of vasopressin.
(Defibrillator whines)

374
00:12:46,244 --> 00:12:47,728
Charge 300.

375
00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:49,296
Clear?

376
00:12:49,364 --> 00:12:50,264
Clear.

377
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:52,066
(Thunk)

378
00:12:53,568 --> 00:12:54,435
(Monitor emitting
continuous tone)

379
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:56,504
Flatline. Start C.P.R.

380
00:12:56,571 --> 00:12:57,855
(Paddles clatter)

381
00:12:57,923 --> 00:13:00,825
(Panting)

382
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:03,878
(Air whistling)

383
00:13:15,123 --> 00:13:18,125
(Tone continues)

384
00:13:25,734 --> 00:13:28,686
Call it.

385
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:30,704
(Tone stops)

386
00:13:30,755 --> 00:13:34,275
Time of death...
17:55, Kandahar time.

387
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:50,791
(Sighs)

388
00:13:58,216 --> 00:13:59,116
(Velcro crackles)

389
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:00,117
Okay.

390
00:14:00,201 --> 00:14:01,602
Ohh.
Any, um...

391
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,536
(Sniffles)

392
00:14:02,604 --> 00:14:04,838
Any history of anemia,

393
00:14:04,906 --> 00:14:07,107
dizzy spells,
low blood pressure?

394
00:14:07,175 --> 00:14:09,610
No.

395
00:14:09,678 --> 00:14:13,280
It's like being sidelined
in the play-offs, isn't it?

396
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:14,515
What?

397
00:14:14,582 --> 00:14:16,250
Oh. No.

398
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:18,652
No, man. Every, uh,
every patient's a priority.

399
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,021
Okay, any history of anemia,

400
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:22,656
dizzy spells,
low blood pressure?

401
00:14:22,724 --> 00:14:24,358
(Laughs)

402
00:14:24,426 --> 00:14:25,526
Ohh.

403
00:14:25,593 --> 00:14:26,760
Whoa. What are you doing?
Where are you going?

404
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:27,745
(Grunts)

405
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:29,196
Your friends need you.

406
00:14:29,264 --> 00:14:32,917
Don't tie yourself up
with a little indigestion.

407
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:34,969
Indigestion's one thing,
but fever and fainting...

408
00:14:35,036 --> 00:14:36,303
No, man. Just get back in bed.
(Sighs)

409
00:14:36,404 --> 00:14:38,806
What? I'm fine.
I'm... I feel better already.

410
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:40,908
Look, I'm the diagnostician.
I diagnose... (Sighs)

411
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:42,109
which means I tell you
when it's fine.

412
00:14:42,177 --> 00:14:44,845
You don't tell me, all right?
Now get back in bed.

413
00:14:44,913 --> 00:14:46,447
Please?

414
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:47,815
All right.

415
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:49,283
That's right, man.

416
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:51,769
I thought agony was strictly
a defeat thing. (Clears throat)

417
00:14:51,853 --> 00:14:54,321
(Panting)
Yeah, well, live and learn.

418
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:55,556
(Chuckles)

419
00:14:55,623 --> 00:14:56,941
(Exhales deeply
 (Panting)

420
00:14:57,025 --> 00:15:00,060
You know, I think you might be
a little more comfortable.

421
00:15:00,128 --> 00:15:03,263
If you took
this uniform top off.

422
00:15:03,331 --> 00:15:05,366
I'm on duty.

423
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,102
Ohh. (Exhales deeply)

424
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:10,471
You're not trying to get me
naked, are you?

425
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:11,472
(Laughs)

426
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:13,641
Yes.
You got me all figured out.

427
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:14,608
(Chuckles)

428
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:16,110
(Chuckles)

429
00:15:16,177 --> 00:15:18,612
(Exhales deeply and sighs)

430
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,514
Come here.

431
00:15:20,581 --> 00:15:22,533
(Sighs and exhales deeply)

432
00:15:24,152 --> 00:15:26,453
Thanks.

433
00:15:26,521 --> 00:15:27,888
Yeah.

434
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:30,691
(Jet engines roaring)

435
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,827
What happened
to, uh, Dr. Pedersen?

436
00:15:33,895 --> 00:15:35,776
I came looking for her earlier.

437
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:37,364
Oh, she's at FOB Ireland
doing psych evals.

438
00:15:37,432 --> 00:15:38,532
Oh.

439
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,769
(Roaring continues)

440
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:44,104
Oh.

441
00:15:44,172 --> 00:15:45,072
(Laughs)

442
00:15:45,123 --> 00:15:47,074
Oh. (Laughs)

443
00:15:47,142 --> 00:15:48,242
(Sighs)

444
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:51,245
Oh, you got the hots
for Dr. Pedersen, do you?

445
00:15:51,312 --> 00:15:52,946
(Scoffs)

446
00:15:53,014 --> 00:15:54,348
What does Helen think
about that?

447
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,267
(Sighs)
Don't go there, Graham.

448
00:15:57,352 --> 00:15:59,753
(Sighs) Anyway...

449
00:15:59,821 --> 00:16:01,338
We broke up two months ago.

450
00:16:01,423 --> 00:16:04,058
You broke up with her?

451
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,126
And you didn't think
to tell me?

452
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:08,295
Why would I tell you?
(Exhales deeply)

453
00:16:08,363 --> 00:16:10,497
I think I'd want to know
about you breaking up

454
00:16:10,565 --> 00:16:12,199
with the woman
that you left me for.

455
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:14,018
Why, so you could gloat?

456
00:16:14,102 --> 00:16:16,603
(Coughs)

457
00:16:16,654 --> 00:16:18,072
(Inhales deeply)

458
00:16:20,775 --> 00:16:23,410
Hey. I just heard
what happened.

459
00:16:23,478 --> 00:16:24,912
I was just talking to Ray.

460
00:16:24,979 --> 00:16:27,548
I mean,
he was asking me about...

461
00:16:27,615 --> 00:16:29,550
Oh, my God.

462
00:16:29,617 --> 00:16:31,335
I think I did something wrong.

463
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:32,853
(Marks) Major Gordon.

464
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:34,171
This is Colonel Axelquist.

465
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:36,823
U.S. Air Force
Board of Investigations.

466
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,192
The colonel
is setting up interviews

467
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:40,260
with anyone who had any contact
with Ray or his crew.

468
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:42,496
Do you have a few minutes?

469
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:54,240
(Axelquist) This is a standard
investigative procedure, major.

470
00:16:54,308 --> 00:16:55,325
We're just trying to get

471
00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:56,743
as complete a picture
as possible

472
00:16:56,794 --> 00:16:58,645
on the events leading
up to the crash.

473
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:00,547
We have
a few preliminary questions.

474
00:17:00,614 --> 00:17:02,582
Is this about the go pills?

475
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:06,519
Uh, Ray...

476
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:07,954
Excuse me...
Uh, Captain Ludford,

477
00:17:08,022 --> 00:17:10,223
uh, caught me on the fly
as he was leaving.

478
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,025
He asked me
for some stimulants,

479
00:17:12,093 --> 00:17:13,026
and I said no.

480
00:17:13,094 --> 00:17:13,993
Well, let me get this straight.

481
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:15,562
Captain Ludford was fatigued,

482
00:17:15,629 --> 00:17:18,231
and he asked you for go pills,
and you refused?

483
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,566
May I remind you, colonel,
that it's not Canadian policy

484
00:17:20,618 --> 00:17:25,038
to give fatigued pilots
stimulants?

485
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:26,906
Thank you, colonel.

486
00:17:28,142 --> 00:17:31,077
So Captain Ludford came
to you exhausted?

487
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:32,846
No, I didn't say
he was exhausted.

488
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:34,547
He was just kidding around,

489
00:17:34,615 --> 00:17:37,317
and I told him that
if he really needed the pills,

490
00:17:37,384 --> 00:17:38,601
he needed to go
to his flight surgeon.

491
00:17:38,686 --> 00:17:41,154
Did you follow up
with the flight surgeon?

492
00:17:41,222 --> 00:17:42,756
No, I didn't.

493
00:17:42,823 --> 00:17:44,257
And did you report this
to Colonel Marks?

494
00:17:44,325 --> 00:17:45,625
No.

495
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:47,327
It was no big thing.

496
00:17:47,394 --> 00:17:48,895
Well, doctor,

497
00:17:48,963 --> 00:17:51,264
we have a dead pilot
and a dead copilot

498
00:17:51,332 --> 00:17:53,032
and two injured parajumpers.

499
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,334
I would say it was
a big thing, wouldn't you?

500
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:56,436
Colonel, may we have a moment?

501
00:17:58,639 --> 00:18:00,640
We'll resume this later.

502
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:01,608
(Clatters)

503
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:03,159
I'm not sure Major Gordon

504
00:18:03,227 --> 00:18:04,744
understands the situation,
colonel.

505
00:18:04,812 --> 00:18:07,263
Maybe you can help her.

506
00:18:07,348 --> 00:18:09,449
Come on.

507
00:18:11,318 --> 00:18:12,252
(Door closes)

508
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,203
What the hell was that about?

509
00:18:13,287 --> 00:18:14,521
He was just trying
to do his job.

510
00:18:14,588 --> 00:18:15,839
Now the most common reason
for a chopper to go down

511
00:18:15,923 --> 00:18:17,307
is pilot error,

512
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:18,558
and what Axelquist is doing
is asking you

513
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,894
to try to help him figure out
if that's the case.

514
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:22,695
Now if you're unwilling
to cooperate,

515
00:18:22,763 --> 00:18:23,897
there will be consequences
for you,

516
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:27,100
either for not reporting Ray
to the flight surgeon

517
00:18:27,168 --> 00:18:28,034
and preventing him from flying.

518
00:18:28,101 --> 00:18:30,103
Or not giving him go pills.

519
00:18:33,207 --> 00:18:36,109
(Sighs)

520
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:41,447
(Sighs)

521
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,128
(Panting) You're not this sick.
(Panting)

522
00:18:55,196 --> 00:18:56,930
Why aren't you this sick?

523
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:59,532
Because I had one kebab.

524
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,100
You had 23.

525
00:19:01,168 --> 00:19:02,769
Ooh. (Exhales unsteadily)

526
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:05,104
The dimenhydrinate should be
kicking in right now.

527
00:19:05,172 --> 00:19:07,173
(Coughing)
Okay. You okay?

528
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:08,341
(Chuckles)

529
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:09,242
(Inhales deeply)

530
00:19:09,293 --> 00:19:11,444
You hate me, don't you...

531
00:19:11,495 --> 00:19:12,846
(Bucket clatters)

532
00:19:12,913 --> 00:19:14,747
for leaving you?

533
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,850
You always get emotional
when you're sick.

534
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:18,284
(Sighs)

535
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,421
Um... (Sighs)

536
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:24,157
Tell me a... a story.

537
00:19:24,225 --> 00:19:25,775
One with a happy ending.

538
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,026
Okay.

539
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:29,729
Well...

540
00:19:29,797 --> 00:19:31,931
Well, once upon a time,

541
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:35,001
there was
a beautiful princess...

542
00:19:35,069 --> 00:19:37,837
and she was smart,

543
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:40,773
athletic,

544
00:19:40,841 --> 00:19:41,941
great in bed.

545
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:43,676
(Chuckles)

546
00:19:44,979 --> 00:19:47,513
She was the fairest
in the land...

547
00:19:48,682 --> 00:19:50,884
and she was loved
by a young boy

548
00:19:50,951 --> 00:19:52,819
from the wrong side
of the tracks.

549
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:55,922
(Voice breaking)
Don't tell me this story.

550
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,157
This is a sad story.

551
00:19:58,259 --> 00:19:59,292
Once upon a time,

552
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,428
there was
a beautiful, big blue platypus.

553
00:20:02,496 --> 00:20:03,396
(Laughs)

554
00:20:03,464 --> 00:20:05,164
It was smart, athletic...

555
00:20:05,232 --> 00:20:06,132
(Laughs)

556
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,767
fantastic in bed. (Laughs)

557
00:20:07,835 --> 00:20:09,201
Better than the princess.

558
00:20:09,253 --> 00:20:11,654
(Laughs)

559
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:13,840
Mm. Princesses.

560
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:14,807
(Chuckles)

561
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,709
Ohh.

562
00:20:20,197 --> 00:20:22,248
We were happy together,
weren't we,

563
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:24,250
until you started working
all the time?

564
00:20:24,318 --> 00:20:25,585
What I mean...

565
00:20:25,636 --> 00:20:27,470
and it had nothing to do with
the fact that you fell in love

566
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:29,656
with someone else.

567
00:20:29,723 --> 00:20:32,158
(Inhales deeply) Ohh.

568
00:20:32,226 --> 00:20:34,360
Hey. Are you okay?

569
00:20:34,428 --> 00:20:35,628
Yeah, I'm okay.

570
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,730
(Grunts and clears throat)

571
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:38,915
Just got up a bit fast.

572
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:40,750
(Grunts)

573
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:42,869
Think I'm dehydrated.

574
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:44,704
(Sighs)

575
00:20:44,772 --> 00:20:46,406
I'm sorry.

576
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:49,342
(Sighs)

577
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,412
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

578
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,301
I can see you're not
a fan of sleep,

579
00:20:58,385 --> 00:21:01,788
but, uh, soap and water is
everyone's friend.

580
00:21:01,855 --> 00:21:03,056
(Laughs)

581
00:21:03,123 --> 00:21:06,114
Forgive me for putting
your health above my hygiene.

582
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:08,661
Yes, take a shower.

583
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:09,862
How's he doing?

584
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,931
He's good.

585
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:13,800
(Ford grunts)

586
00:21:14,835 --> 00:21:15,768
(Groans)

587
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:17,603
(Whispers)
Hey, hey. It's okay.

588
00:21:17,671 --> 00:21:19,138
Ray?

589
00:21:22,943 --> 00:21:24,544
I'm sorry, T.

590
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:27,747
(Woman) Can I help you?

591
00:21:27,815 --> 00:21:29,048
(Vans) Dr. Hill?

592
00:21:30,718 --> 00:21:33,269
Are they okay?

593
00:21:33,354 --> 00:21:34,620
Yeah, they will be. Yeah.

594
00:21:34,688 --> 00:21:35,555
Why, do you want to see them?

595
00:21:35,606 --> 00:21:36,923
Yes, but, Dr. Hill,

596
00:21:36,957 --> 00:21:38,724
there are two Afghan men
waiting for you at the gate.

597
00:21:38,776 --> 00:21:39,892
They need to speak
with you urgently

598
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,427
something about your farm.

599
00:21:41,495 --> 00:21:42,428
My farm? What do you mean?

600
00:21:42,496 --> 00:21:44,130
I don't know,
but they're angry.

601
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:47,633
Uh, okay. Well, just find out
what you can, all right?

602
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:50,203
I'm sure your agent skills
will come in handy.

603
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,808
Okay. I'll be right back.

604
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:58,411
(Jet engines roaring)

605
00:21:58,479 --> 00:21:59,746
Can you tell us what happened?

606
00:21:59,813 --> 00:22:01,681
He came in in a bad way.

607
00:22:01,715 --> 00:22:04,250
He had 50% burns on his body,

608
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:06,285
and, uh, internal injuries.

609
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:11,374
- Your friends lost someone, huh?
- Yeah. Captain Ray Ludford.

610
00:22:11,442 --> 00:22:13,593
He was a friend of mine
as well.

611
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,795
Kind of. I-I didn't know
him very long, but...

612
00:22:15,863 --> 00:22:19,365
You don't have to know someone
long in this place.

613
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:21,167
You know, sometimes a day...

614
00:22:21,235 --> 00:22:25,338
it's enough to form
a deep, lasting bond.

615
00:22:25,406 --> 00:22:29,375
(Helicopter blades whirring)

616
00:22:29,443 --> 00:22:31,177
I'm sorry for your loss.

617
00:22:33,313 --> 00:22:35,148
(Clears throat)

618
00:22:35,215 --> 00:22:37,083
I'm sorry
you're not feeling well.

619
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:38,918
Well, so am I.

620
00:22:38,986 --> 00:22:41,587
I mean, you, me, and a bed?

621
00:22:41,655 --> 00:22:43,423
(Laughs) It's kind of a waste.

622
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,625
(Chuckles)

623
00:22:45,692 --> 00:22:47,777
You know, don't get me wrong.

624
00:22:47,845 --> 00:22:50,780
I'm glad I have an excuse
to see you again.

625
00:22:50,848 --> 00:22:53,616
Just wish it was under
better circumstances. (Chuckles)

626
00:22:53,684 --> 00:22:55,802
Me, too.

627
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:04,710
(Snoring)

628
00:23:04,778 --> 00:23:08,281
(Engines rumbling)

629
00:23:08,348 --> 00:23:09,916
Graham.

630
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:13,686
(Continues snoring)

631
00:23:13,754 --> 00:23:15,555
(Whispers)
Graham.

632
00:23:15,622 --> 00:23:16,656
(Helicopter blades whirring)

633
00:23:16,723 --> 00:23:17,790
(Normal voice)
Graham.

634
00:23:17,858 --> 00:23:18,858
Yeah.

635
00:23:18,926 --> 00:23:19,892
You're snoring.

636
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,562
Sorry. You need anything?

637
00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:24,864
Mm...
(Sighs)

638
00:23:24,932 --> 00:23:27,700
Oh, I haven't felt like
throwing up in over an hour.

639
00:23:27,768 --> 00:23:29,802
That's improvement.

640
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:32,672
You're out of uniform.

641
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:33,806
Off duty.

642
00:23:33,874 --> 00:23:35,708
Oh.

643
00:23:36,743 --> 00:23:38,978
You don't have to stay.

644
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,747
(Sighs)
Hey. Where are you going?

645
00:23:41,815 --> 00:23:43,382
I gotta pee.

646
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,117
Ooh.

647
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:46,886
Hang on. Hang on.

648
00:23:46,937 --> 00:23:48,905
Mm.

649
00:23:52,893 --> 00:23:54,861
(Sighs)

650
00:23:58,816 --> 00:24:02,135
Ohh. Mm.

651
00:24:03,036 --> 00:24:05,138
Mm.

652
00:24:07,341 --> 00:24:09,375
I...

653
00:24:09,443 --> 00:24:13,446
cannot be your rebound person.

654
00:24:14,281 --> 00:24:15,248
Graham, I don't...

655
00:24:15,315 --> 00:24:17,133
Let's get you to the bathroom.

656
00:24:17,217 --> 00:24:19,585
(Sighs)

657
00:24:19,636 --> 00:24:21,720
Okay. You're okay.

658
00:24:21,772 --> 00:24:23,706
(Sighs)

659
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,841
I need to speak
with Major Gordon.

660
00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:27,026
Dr. Gordon.

661
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:29,328
Excuse me. I wanted to give
our young men some time

662
00:24:29,396 --> 00:24:32,131
to rest before we chatted,
but it appears they're awake.

663
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:33,900
(Object clatters)

664
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:35,368
I just have a few questions.

665
00:24:35,435 --> 00:24:37,386
Okay.

666
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:38,354
(Chair wheels rattle)

667
00:24:38,438 --> 00:24:40,356
Gentlemen.

668
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,374
How you holding up?

669
00:24:41,441 --> 00:24:42,375
Good.

670
00:24:42,442 --> 00:24:43,643
(Clicks pen)

671
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,379
Did the captain seem incoherent
or fatigued in any way?

672
00:24:46,446 --> 00:24:48,548
No. Not at all, sir.

673
00:24:48,615 --> 00:24:50,082
The engine.

674
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,951
Yeah. The, uh...

675
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:54,086
The engine felt off, sir.

676
00:24:54,154 --> 00:24:55,404
(Axelquist)
Uh, the flight safety team

677
00:24:55,472 --> 00:24:58,357
has yet to find any signs
of mechanical failure.

678
00:24:58,425 --> 00:25:00,193
I know my copters
and I know Ray.

679
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,562
The engine was off.

680
00:25:02,629 --> 00:25:04,297
He wasn't.

681
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:05,698
Well, come now, sergeant

682
00:25:05,766 --> 00:25:07,066
we both know human error r...

683
00:25:07,117 --> 00:25:08,634
Yeah, but you
weren't there, okay?

684
00:25:08,702 --> 00:25:09,936
- You don't know what happened!
- Hey! Hey, hey! Hey!

685
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:11,971
(Coughs) Deep breaths.
Deep breaths.

686
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:14,310
Get out! Major, I can
hardly be held responsible...

687
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,008
(Marks) That wasn't
a request, colonel.

688
00:25:16,076 --> 00:25:19,078
There are a lot of eyes
on this investigation, colonel,

689
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:21,047
and they have
a lot of questions,

690
00:25:21,098 --> 00:25:23,449
such as why Major Gordon
failed to treat

691
00:25:23,517 --> 00:25:27,653
a clearly fatigued pilot
according to protocol,

692
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:30,089
for instance.

693
00:25:30,157 --> 00:25:31,824
I'll let you get back to work.

694
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:33,693
Major Gordon...

695
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,762
We'll speak again soon.

696
00:25:36,813 --> 00:25:39,632
Colonel.

697
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:49,719
(Engines rumbling)

698
00:25:50,055 --> 00:25:52,973
(Speaking indistinctly)

699
00:25:53,024 --> 00:25:55,425
(Men speaking
middle eastern dialect)

700
00:25:55,545 --> 00:25:57,072
Uh, okay, okay. Okay, okay.
What's going on?

701
00:25:57,192 --> 00:25:59,032
They say they care
for the crops on your farm,

702
00:25:59,152 --> 00:26:01,864
but it seems they have come
to a situation of disagreement.

703
00:26:01,984 --> 00:26:03,619
Listen, I-I haven't got
time for this.

704
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,137
I need you to sort this out.

705
00:26:05,205 --> 00:26:07,106
You mean be your agent?

706
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:08,841
Yeah, like, uh...
Yeah, like Jerry Maguire.

707
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:10,918
I've seen
the "Jerry Maguire" DVD.

708
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,319
Three times.

709
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:13,888
He makes money to be
an agent...

710
00:26:13,956 --> 00:26:16,457
So much money,
they show it to him.

711
00:26:16,525 --> 00:26:21,462
Okay, fine. Fine. Uh, just...
Just name your price, okay?

712
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,698
(Both speak
middle eastern dialect)

713
00:26:25,534 --> 00:26:27,185
Hey.

714
00:26:28,403 --> 00:26:30,571
Hey. Hi.
How are you doing?

715
00:26:30,639 --> 00:26:34,008
I'm gonna need those labs
A.S.A.P., major.

716
00:26:34,076 --> 00:26:36,244
Yes, captain.

717
00:26:38,213 --> 00:26:39,614
Done.

718
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,082
(Object clatters)

719
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,986
I'm back in five.

720
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:47,338
Thank you.

721
00:26:47,422 --> 00:26:49,924
She likes you.

722
00:26:49,992 --> 00:26:51,058
Do you like her?

723
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:53,594
You know, my dad told me once.

724
00:26:53,662 --> 00:26:54,929
That if you like a woman,
you should tell her,

725
00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:56,063
and if you don't,

726
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:58,065
well, you should tell
her that, too.

727
00:26:58,133 --> 00:26:59,634
It's simple.

728
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,002
Unless...

729
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:03,037
You like another woman more.

730
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:04,405
- There's no other woman.
- No?

731
00:27:04,473 --> 00:27:06,040
No.

732
00:27:06,108 --> 00:27:08,009
I mean, who else? No.
There's no one. (Chuckles)

733
00:27:08,076 --> 00:27:09,310
Dr. Gordon?

734
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,078
Rebecca?

735
00:27:11,146 --> 00:27:12,613
No, we're just friends, man.

736
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:14,682
Well, if you say so.

737
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,350
(Inhales deeply)

738
00:27:16,418 --> 00:27:18,486
You haven't figured anything
out yet, have you?

739
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:19,720
Look, I'm telling you,
we're just friends, all right?

740
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:21,122
Just drop it.

741
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:24,025
(Chuckles) You haven't figured
out what's wrong with me.

742
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:26,260
Right.

743
00:27:26,328 --> 00:27:29,497
No. Not yet, but I will.

744
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:32,867
You've been bested
by a bug, doctor.

745
00:27:32,935 --> 00:27:34,302
It happens.

746
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:36,771
Hmm. (Sniffles)

747
00:27:40,809 --> 00:27:41,742
(Door closes)

748
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,862
(Whistling)

749
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,250
(Grunts)

750
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:53,054
(Sighs)

751
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:53,955
Thanks.

752
00:27:54,022 --> 00:27:55,539
Sip it slow. (Sniffles)

753
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,158
There's a bucket there,

754
00:27:57,225 --> 00:27:59,694
should the need arise.

755
00:28:01,797 --> 00:28:04,565
Where did you get a rose
on base?

756
00:28:04,633 --> 00:28:06,100
I mean, in Kandahar?

757
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:08,502
You know me.

758
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,770
(Chuckles)

759
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:11,872
Yeah, I do.

760
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:20,982
(Swallows)

761
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:22,149
No urge to hurl.

762
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:24,819
(Chuckles) I think
the worst has passed.

763
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:26,287
Yep.

764
00:28:26,355 --> 00:28:27,722
You're back in uniform.

765
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,424
Yep. I'm on duty in, um...

766
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:32,994
three and a half minutes.

767
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:35,102
(Jet engines roaring)
Graham.

768
00:28:36,698 --> 00:28:37,581
(Sighs)

769
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:39,934
(Chuckles) Thank you.

770
00:28:40,054 --> 00:28:42,317
(Kisses)

771
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,606
(Kisses)

772
00:28:45,674 --> 00:28:48,142
(Whispers)
It wasn't so bad, was it...

773
00:28:48,262 --> 00:28:50,111
(Normal voice)
when we were married?

774
00:28:52,247 --> 00:28:54,448
(Whispers) No.

775
00:28:54,516 --> 00:28:56,150
(Voice breaks)
We were good together.

776
00:28:56,218 --> 00:28:58,352
I still love you.

777
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:00,488
(Kisses)

778
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,226
Uh...

779
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:07,428
(Clicks tongue and sighs)
I gotta go.

780
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,512
Just a few more minutes.

781
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:10,348
I...

782
00:29:10,432 --> 00:29:12,633
I can check back with you
in an hour.

783
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:14,235
Graham, wait.

784
00:29:14,302 --> 00:29:15,736
(Sighs)

785
00:29:15,804 --> 00:29:17,938
Ohh.

786
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,123
Okay, go.

787
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:21,625
See ya later.

788
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,797
(Door closes)

789
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:26,580
(Sniffles)

790
00:29:26,648 --> 00:29:29,250
(Tape crackles)

791
00:29:29,317 --> 00:29:31,869
(Indistinct conversations)

792
00:29:31,953 --> 00:29:33,821
Hey, any news yet?

793
00:29:33,889 --> 00:29:36,123
Just waiting
for the C.T. scan.

794
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,759
Just, uh, checking in.

795
00:29:38,827 --> 00:29:41,362
(Indistinct conversations)

796
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:43,330
So... Rebecca.

797
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:45,002
Yes. Rebecca.

798
00:29:45,122 --> 00:29:47,234
Right.
You two are kinda...

799
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,569
We're just friends.

800
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,804
Friends.

801
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,772
(Rustles papers)
Right. Ahem.

802
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,441
No, man,
I mean, you... you consumed

803
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:55,209
a substantial amount
of food this week

804
00:29:55,277 --> 00:29:56,784
maybe it is dietary after all.

805
00:29:56,904 --> 00:29:59,780
We've got dolma, mantu,
kufta, shami,

806
00:29:59,848 --> 00:30:03,100
rice, rice, and more rice,
maushuwa...

807
00:30:03,185 --> 00:30:04,985
That wasn't a week.

808
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,721
That was a Friday.

809
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:09,573
What can I say?
I'm not a salad guy.

810
00:30:09,658 --> 00:30:10,691
Yeah, but even so, man,

811
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:12,960
I mean, if you're eating
like a linebacker

812
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:14,395
and fainting like a debutante,

813
00:30:14,463 --> 00:30:17,348
nutrients are clearly
not being absorbed.

814
00:30:17,468 --> 00:30:21,602
I don't think a scan is actually
gonna tell us very much.

815
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,770
(Jet engines roaring)

816
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,939
You're gonna have to give me
a sample, my friend.

817
00:30:25,006 --> 00:30:27,808
Not the kind that goes tinkle.

818
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,564
(Stomps)

819
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,334
(Axelquist)
All right, sergeant.

820
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,253
If anything else occurs
in the next few days,

821
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,320
don't hesitate.

822
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:41,455
- If you could, uh...
- Yes?

823
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,725
Tell me why I'm being asked
to comment on this.

824
00:30:44,793 --> 00:30:45,693
Dismissed.

825
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:48,629
Thank you for your time.

826
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:50,097
"'Flying high in the skies, '.

827
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:51,799
By Warren Wilder
of 'The National Insight.'"

828
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:53,317
Thanks, but I prefer
"The Times."

829
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:56,871
"While there can be no denying
the overall effectiveness

830
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,706
of Kandahar's

831
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,075
"Conflicting national policies
on medical treatment

832
00:31:01,143 --> 00:31:03,094

833
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:07,064
Well, Mr. Wilder certainly has
a particular perspececve.

834
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:08,449
I wonder how he came to that.

835
00:31:08,517 --> 00:31:10,401
(Jet engines roaring)

836
00:31:10,485 --> 00:31:12,753
If you're making
an accusation, colonel,

837
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:14,054
let's make it
quickly and clearly.

838
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,990
When it comes
to care in this hospital,

839
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:17,892
it's not personal.

840
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,693
It sure as hell
isn't political.

841
00:31:19,761 --> 00:31:20,828
It's not about laying blame.

842
00:31:20,896 --> 00:31:23,898
It's about
finding responsibility.

843
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:28,202
Now can you have Major Gordon
meet me here in 30 minutes?

844
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:48,639
Hi.

845
00:31:48,756 --> 00:31:50,407
Hey.

846
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,159
Well, congratulations.

847
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,595
You are the proud father
of a tapeworm.

848
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:57,188
Well, at least it's the lesser
of the possible medical evils.

849
00:31:57,308 --> 00:31:59,066
No, you don't understand.

850
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:02,102
I-I don't even fish
with worms,

851
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,038
and I have one inside of me?

852
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:05,873
I... (Sighs)

853
00:32:05,941 --> 00:32:07,474
I don't feel so g...

854
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:09,426
Tough guy has
a squeamish spot, huh?

855
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:12,046
Oh, and the
tough girl doesn't?

856
00:32:12,113 --> 00:32:14,064
(Sighs)

857
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,349
Uh, look, it's okay.

858
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:18,452
I understand if this all
makes you uneasy.

859
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,921
Mm. No, no. It's not...
It's not you.

860
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:22,890
It's just, um...

861
00:32:24,392 --> 00:32:26,293
I have a lot on my plate
right now.

862
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,330
With that colonel,
that investigator?

863
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:33,334
Listen, I've seen
so many men like him.

864
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:35,736
You know, they're just
all full of bluster.

865
00:32:35,804 --> 00:32:38,072
It's not him I'm worried about.

866
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:41,976
What if I made
the wrong decision?

867
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,510
If Ray was fatigued,

868
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:45,946
maybe I should've given him
the pills.

869
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:47,490
(Sighs)

870
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,145
Even the very best of us

871
00:32:49,265 --> 00:32:52,456
can only do our best, Rebecca.

872
00:32:52,576 --> 00:32:56,590
The only question
you have to answer is,

873
00:32:56,658 --> 00:32:58,726
did you?

874
00:33:05,227 --> 00:33:07,595
You don't have to write it down.
You can just tell me.

875
00:33:08,563 --> 00:33:10,480
You've gotta be kidding.

876
00:33:10,548 --> 00:33:12,049
(Clicks)

877
00:33:16,054 --> 00:33:18,789
Look, you are mediating
a small dispute, okay?

878
00:33:18,856 --> 00:33:21,174
It's not world peace.
I think that's a very fair fee.

879
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:22,259
Fair to you, maybe.

880
00:33:23,727 --> 00:33:24,611
Okay. Okay.

881
00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:25,579
(Clicks pen)

882
00:33:25,646 --> 00:33:27,531
This is so stupid.

883
00:33:27,598 --> 00:33:30,200
(Jet engines roaring)

884
00:33:30,268 --> 00:33:31,618
(Sighs)

885
00:33:31,702 --> 00:33:32,702
Ohh.

886
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,087
Okay. What do you want?
(Crumples paper)

887
00:33:36,908 --> 00:33:39,493
I've always wanted
a pair of Italian shoes.

888
00:33:40,995 --> 00:33:42,679
(Sighs)

889
00:33:42,747 --> 00:33:44,514
The pint-sized hustler's
got me over a barrel

890
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:47,383
with the whole
"I can't speak Farsi" thing.

891
00:33:47,435 --> 00:33:49,853
I'm trying not to worm
out of this man.

892
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:53,173
Please don't use the "w" word.

893
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:55,559
So the Suzy thing...
Is it bad sex, good sex?

894
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,860
(Whispers) Suzy?

895
00:33:56,928 --> 00:33:58,728
(Joe)
It might not just be Suzy.

896
00:33:58,796 --> 00:34:00,931
I'm glad to see you guys find
my life so amusing.

897
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:02,432
(Lid clatters)
What? Look, I like Suzy,

898
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,800
but I can't have her
thinking that, uh,

899
00:34:03,851 --> 00:34:04,801
this is going somewhere
that it's not.

900
00:34:04,869 --> 00:34:06,002
Ohh.

901
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,170
You know, if Suzy thinks
she's gonna find

902
00:34:07,238 --> 00:34:09,072
the fairy tale here,
then she's deluding herself.

903
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,574
Man, you gotta be honest
with her, man.

904
00:34:10,641 --> 00:34:13,043
You can't string her along.
It's cruel.

905
00:34:13,111 --> 00:34:15,295
Oh, we're all bastards
on the inside.

906
00:34:15,363 --> 00:34:17,681
Although in your case,
you're like a worm factory.

907
00:34:17,748 --> 00:34:20,250
You know, if the thought of that
didn't make me nauauous,

908
00:34:20,317 --> 00:34:22,285
I'd kill you with this bowl.

909
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:23,286
En guarde.

910
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:25,021
I'd like to see that, actually.

911
00:34:25,089 --> 00:34:26,156
Okay, I'm gonna get you
to roll up on your side

912
00:34:26,224 --> 00:34:27,390
and open your mouth, all right?

913
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:29,459
(Grunts) Ohh.

914
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:31,144
Wait a second.
How does this work?

915
00:34:31,229 --> 00:34:32,462
Oh, it's actually
pretty simple.

916
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,864
You just lay in this position

917
00:34:33,931 --> 00:34:35,298
- and the tapeworm, attracted to the smell...
- Oh, God.

918
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:36,466
- and the warmth of the curdled milk...
(Whispers) - Oh!

919
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:37,501
(Laughs silently)

920
00:34:37,568 --> 00:34:39,136
will crawl up
and out your open mouth.

921
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:40,670
Then once it's in sight...

922
00:34:40,738 --> 00:34:43,790
(Clanks and clicks)

923
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:44,875
(Weak voice) Uh, what?

924
00:34:44,942 --> 00:34:47,644
It's gonna come up through...

925
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:49,379
through...

926
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:52,149
Whoa. I didn't expect him
to pass out like that.

927
00:34:52,216 --> 00:34:53,517
Yeah, I thought he'd puke.

928
00:34:53,584 --> 00:34:54,501
- Nice.
- Yeah.

929
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:56,470
We'll start him on a run
of praziquantel,

930
00:34:56,537 --> 00:34:59,306
and, uh, the worm should be
dead in a day or two.

931
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,258
We'll watch him
until he's clear.

932
00:35:01,325 --> 00:35:02,526
I'm impressed, Dr. Trang.

933
00:35:02,577 --> 00:35:05,512
You know, letting
your inner bastard shine.

934
00:35:09,717 --> 00:35:12,652
You here?
I got a few minutes.

935
00:35:28,953 --> 00:35:30,053
(Rustles paper)

936
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:34,057
(Inhales and exhales deeply)

937
00:35:34,108 --> 00:35:36,359
(Door closes)

938
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:38,028
(Clicks)

939
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,530
We're back on the record.

940
00:35:41,866 --> 00:35:43,800
So are you familiar
with studies

941
00:35:43,868 --> 00:35:45,702
on the safety and effectiveness
of stimulant use.

942
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,637
in extended flight operations?

943
00:35:47,705 --> 00:35:49,973
Only with those that
you sent me this morning.

944
00:35:51,309 --> 00:35:55,078
And when you declined
to give Captain Ludford

945
00:35:55,146 --> 00:35:58,148
the medication  he requested,
you were not familiar

946
00:35:58,216 --> 00:35:59,649
with these studies
at the time, correct?

947
00:35:59,717 --> 00:36:00,650
Correct.

948
00:36:00,718 --> 00:36:03,053
Knowing what you know now,

949
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,455
would your decision
have been different?

950
00:36:05,523 --> 00:36:07,624
No.

951
00:36:07,692 --> 00:36:10,159
Even though these studies show
that stimulant use

952
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:14,264
under medical supervision
is both safe and effective,

953
00:36:14,332 --> 00:36:15,999
and even though stimulants
are routinely used

954
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:17,701
to treat narcolepsy
and A.D.H.D.,

955
00:36:17,768 --> 00:36:19,069
even in children?

956
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:22,539
Captain Ludford showed no signs
of A.D.H.D. or narcolepsy.

957
00:36:22,607 --> 00:36:25,542
or of excessive fatigue,
either, for that matter.

958
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:29,079
Are, uh, stimulant drugs
ever given to Canadian forces

959
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:30,413
in flight operations?

960
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:31,748
(Door closes)

961
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:33,233
No. Not that I know of.

962
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:34,651
Well, forgive me, major,

963
00:36:34,702 --> 00:36:37,787
I've been accused of playing
politics in this investigation,

964
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:40,090
but isn't it the worst kind
of politics to deny

965
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:42,959
our men and women whatever help
they need to do their duty?

966
00:36:45,029 --> 00:36:47,130
I do not and will not prescribe

967
00:36:47,231 --> 00:36:50,083
such a serious psychostimulant
with reckless abandon...

968
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,302
without a physical,
without a history,

969
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,104
and without a damn good reason.

970
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:55,905
Now if I had any reason
to believe at all

971
00:36:55,973 --> 00:36:58,008
That Captain Ludford really
needed such a drug,

972
00:36:58,075 --> 00:36:59,943
I would have done everything
in my power

973
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:02,145
to stop him from flying.

974
00:37:02,213 --> 00:37:04,431
And if you're wrong, major?

975
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:07,701
If... (Sighs)

976
00:37:07,785 --> 00:37:10,887
<i>If</i> it proves that pilot fatigue
played a role in the crash,

977
00:37:10,955 --> 00:37:12,555
then yes,

978
00:37:12,623 --> 00:37:14,357
that will be on my conscience.

979
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:17,093
All I can say to you is
that in my brief encounter

980
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:19,696
with Captain Ludford, he showed
no evidence of impairment,

981
00:37:19,764 --> 00:37:22,432
and my decision would be
exactly the same.

982
00:37:25,169 --> 00:37:26,753
(Pen clatters)

983
00:37:26,837 --> 00:37:28,371
Thank you.

984
00:37:35,366 --> 00:37:38,102

987

The unused piece of land
at the back of your farm...

988
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:53,901
you know the one
you promised to them both?

989
00:37:53,952 --> 00:37:56,371
Well, surprise, surprise.
They both want it.

990
00:37:56,438 --> 00:37:59,040
Right. Explain to them
that I made a mistake.

991
00:37:59,108 --> 00:38:01,342
I did. So...

992
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,131
So? Look, you're wearing
your payday.

993
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:05,413

00:38:31,273 --> 00:38:32,156
Okay.

1009
00:38:32,241 --> 00:38:33,124
Thanks, doctor.

1010
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:34,225

1013

Neither will use
the land themselves

1014
00:38:39,175 --> 00:38:41,712
instead they'll rent it out
and split the profits.

I just wanted to say
I'm sorry I've been weird.

1022
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:04,739
You know, I had
an amazing time the other day.

I got a million things

can go anywhere.
