of your man.

567

David, we really must put
the poor man to bed.

No, I was alone.

569
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,290
Didn't you bother to get
a weather report before you left?

570

No.

571
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:41,996
Did you notify the Coastguard of your route?

572
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:43,711
David, darling, what does it matter?

573
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:46,041
It matters, because if he did,

574
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:48,457
there may be men out there
risking their lives looking for him.

575
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,885
We can let them know
that he's sitting here safe and sound.

No. No, um...

577

583

can have a nice long sleep.

- Yes.

Well, there's a radio transmitter
at Tom's cottage,

688
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:42,133

more to do with the lighthouse.

on the day we were married.

692

That's how he lost his legs.

693
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:01,399
He was training to be a fighter pilot,

694
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:04,482
and then after the accident, he...

695
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,614
Well, we both wanted to run away,

696
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:10,744
and so we came here.

697
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,949
Seemed like a good idea.

698
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:16,827
Might have been a mistake.

699
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:19,500
Well, you can't blame him
for wanting to run away.

700
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,000
No, I don't.

701
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:24,165
It's terribly sad.

702
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:27,335
No, it was our fault completely.

703
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:29,468
We'd had a bit to drink,

704
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:33,302
and we were driving much too fast,
and then suddenly there was this lorry...

705
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,675
No, I meant it was terribly sad

706
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,307
because you're so unhappy now.

707
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:46,765
Is it that obvious?

708
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:56,030
I do love him, you know.

709
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:58,737
The way he used to be.

710
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:04,086
Times when he's suddenly like the old David

711
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:07,336
and he and Jo and I
go and have a picnic on the cliff

712
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:08,589
or something like that...

713
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:13,762
He spends most of his time now with Tom.

714
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:15,802

his Granny and where she is.
