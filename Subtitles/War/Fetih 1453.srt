Huma Hatun, healthy male child was born Lord.

16
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,960 
Out of respect for our prophet, his name Mehmet.

17
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,480 
The name I gave him, let God decide his fate.

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,120 
I told you that there will ever beat you Hassan.

20
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,400 
And I've told you that this will be my happiest day.

21
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,200 
Received a letter from Khalil Pasha of Adrianople.

22
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,520 
<i> Mehmet was more like 12 years mount the throne. </ i></i>

23
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,160

But <i> Chief Vizier Halil Pasha, concerns that the Crusaders</i>
will take in the Ottoman lands, Murad II returned to power. </ i>

27
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,560 
<i> Mehmed was removed from the throne and was sent to Saruhan Sanjak. </ i></i>

28
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:14,680 
He had strong hands, capturing cities, armies crush ...

29
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,040 
Not one time did not showered me.

30
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,560 
He had a keen eye, he saw the future of the state.

31
00:07:29,920 --> 00:06:36,000 
Not once, not looked at me with love.

32
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,720 
How much I loved you never saw.

33
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,440 
My heart beats to kiss the ground on which it was based.

34
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:57,840 
From that day on, my heart will beat to take over
land on which you could not set foot Dad!

35
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,120 
To find out great country!

36
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,200 
Why did not my father viziers are far from me?

37
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,480 
Worthy of your status, stand by me.

38
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,440 
After five years, I returned to the throne deserved.

39
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,720 
What do you say, Halil Pasha?

40
00:08:51,840 --> 00:09:03,880 
Then, you were very young Lord. Crusaders
had crossed the Danube to expel us from Rumelia.

41
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,440 
We asked your father to return to the throne.

42
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,760 
Whatever we did was for the state.

43
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,160 
If you think we made a mistake, our life is yours.

44
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:38,880 
I believe so, for the good of the country they proclaim
as chief vizier.

45
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,920 
Shahabettin, Zaurus and Saradzha Viziers will be too.

46
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,840 
<i> CONSTANTINOPLE </ i></i>

47
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:28,000 
Murat Bey died Supreme Emperor!
Sultan Mehmed, the second time was on the throne.

48
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,800 
I see that as me and you make you happy
this news.

49
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,800 
I'm not happy emperor.

50
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,880 
Grand Duke is afraid that her son and his father will
tried to besiege our city, as I understand.

51
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:00,000 
Remember why Murat Bey gave up the siege last time.

52
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,360 
That proclaim him as the Sultan is very even.
Pathetic successor.

53
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,760 
Now we have a strong candidate for the Sultan
shehzade (Prince) Orhan.

54
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:22,680 
Excuse me, but that dreams are meaningless.

55
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,680 
The only desire is to Sultan Mehmed
destroy our empire.

56
00:11:28,920 --> 00:08:32,120 
To get into town, he studied
engineering sciences.

57
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:38,240 
To understand our weak traits learn our language.
Also religion.

58
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,680 
It may be young but he is antichrist himself!

59
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:52,400 
Grand Duke Notares, stop worrying.
Mehmed was deposed before.

60
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,760 
His reputation among the people is low.

61
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,200 
Prior to his throne rejoice not, will
show him his power, not fear.

62
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:08,960 
Send Envoy to consult Odrin.Mehmed
our peaceful policy.

63
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:25,400 
Do not be older by all!
Learning-Sultan to hold a sword and you don 'was reflected Hasan!

64
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,800 
Come and sit down.

65
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:39,920 
I'm afraid of you know, what government?
Who will teach him?

66
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000 
Vladetelstvoto is in the soul, or has it or not.

67
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:54,120 
Murat Bay, this was it? In Varna, in Kosovo
we are together.

68
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,000 
For it is not an eye, a thousand eyes if I could I would give!

69
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:05,320 
A Mehmed .... Do so, Master!
He was only 12 when I mount the throne.

70
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:15,600 
Nobody cares. Go, toppled him?
They took it. Everybody knows that.

71
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:23,400 
In its place if the doll came to Byzantium,
Orhan traitor, happier you would be?

72
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:32,080 
Without knowing it, talking.
Someday I will be ashamed of those words.

73
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,000 
Sultan Mehmed is determined to finish, what his father failed.

74
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:04,280 
His next goal is Rom. doubt this.

75
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:15,280 
Emperor Constantine must accept the agreement adopted in Florence
to join the church.

76
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,040 
Thus, if we need to do, and pressure.

77
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,320 
True is, from these faithless Turks, a greater threat may not have.

78
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,240 
You can use bezopitnostta Mehmed to get rid
forever by the Ottomans.

79
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:40,160 
Constantinople is a Muslim or capital, or Catholic.

80
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:50,000 
I do not think that Mehmet is smarter or bolder than his father.
But we must consider all possibilities.

81
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,480 
We can not leave Constantinople to the faithless!

82
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,400 
God is on our side.

83
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,960 
You're right, made chief Vizier Halil Pasha.
Not even the power to evict the man who ousted him.

84
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,600 
We must take advantage of this Ilyaz Bay.
To send news to others.

85
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,960 
Time to get rid of the Ottomans.

86
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,600 
Thanks for the nice words Imprerator Constantine, for my father.

87
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,680 
And Orhan ...

88
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:12,160 
Emperor you want to increase payments to Orhan 300,000.

89
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,440 
For us it is important to live in a reputable environment.

90
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:29,280 
We will release an order. Tell Impratora you
that his desire friendship will be accepted by us.

91
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,160 
Do you believe in the sincerity of Constantine?

92
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,160 
Can not exceed either the strength or courage, Lord.

93
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:58,880 
Contact Latin, Hungarian and Serbian rulers also with the Pope.

94
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,280 
Tell them that and they want to live in peace.

95
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,160 
As you wish Lord.

96
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,360 
You are free.

97
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,120 
Zanos Shaadettin and grazing, you stay.

98
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,840 
I see that the decisions that I made you disappointed.

99
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,440 
We should question the decisions of the Sultan.

100
00:17:25,160 --> 00:12:32,520 
But before you issued the command, if you ask our opinion.
Then we'll say the words.

101
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,240 
For the future of our country, there is no greater purpose than
conquest of Constantinople.

102
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:47,280 
Before you eliminate your way to victory, we must be patient.

103
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,840 
Mother, I miss my father.

104
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,960 
Not his father, Sultan. How do you say?
My sultan.
105
00:18:16,000 -> 00:18:21,524
Sultan, I know that in everything you do has a wisdom.

105
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:30,040 
To ascend again Khalil Pasha as chief vizier and relationships
Byzantium created disappointment among the people.

106
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,120 
They give it as a vulnerability.

107
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,200 
I'm concerned, if not win the confidence of the army and the people

108
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,120 
If you do not feel under your power, we can have big problems.

109
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,480 
Power is not a demonstration of power to the people Zanos.

110
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:59,160 
To protecting the interests of the people, prosperity
and build their future.

111
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,200 
And that's what makes a great Sultan.

112
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:12,640 
Do not worry, its time and my people and
my army will understand why I have decided that now.

113
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,680 
Checkmate.

114
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,560 
Welcome, Gulbahar Hatun.

115
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,240 
It was a long journey, Lord.

116
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,520 
But you see, it was worth.

117
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,040 
Yes, Dad!
My sultan!

118
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,160 
Lack many of your son shehzade Bayazat.

119
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,120 
Even in their dreams repeat your name.

120
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,640 
Go to rest.

121
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:10,840 
<i> Port of Genoa, Italy </ i></i>

122
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,360 
Age!

123
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,040 
Not least I would have missed.

124
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,160 
I saw time with the File Type duke, but I could not convince him.

125
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,680 
Not at all interested in your sketches, unfortunately.

126
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,520 
I expected it.

127
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,600 
He told me if your father accepted you will immediately open a workshop.

128
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,000 
You know my father will not accept it.

129
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,040 
I know. I said the Duke.

130
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,800 
Thank you for everything. I owe you.
Goodbye.

131
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,640 
Age! Stay here!

132
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,600 
Marry me.

133
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,200 
We will bring your father. And the duke will convince him of the time.

134
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,200 
Even going to help your father to open a shop.

135
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:39,000 
And before I tell you. To me will always stay
as a valuable friend.

136
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,960 
And could not sleep.

137
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,440 
Why not asleep, son?

138
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,840 
Sultans do not you love the kids, Mom?

139
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:42,360 
What? As you grow you will see,
how much they love you.

140
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,160 
My son!

141
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,080 
Mehmed!

142
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:13,800 
I am Osman. Turkish beylik found, those who came after me.

143
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,120 
Grandparents thy father, made it a huge country.

144
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:26,080 
You're the man who will turn this country
a strong Empire Mehmed.

145
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:37,080 
This ring most you deserve it.

146
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,960 
Foreshadowed by our great prophet Conqueror Mehmed you!

147
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,440 
Be blessed!

148
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:32,320 
Sultan of mine! Are you okay?

149
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:39,720 
Or I'll take Constantinople, or he me!

150
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:52,720 
Issa Pasha command of the yard in Gelibolu make
one hundred ships a year.

151
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,680 
Shaadettin grazing like three huge pots to make.
Immediately, my Lord.

152
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,760 
Khalil Pasha, I extended report enicherskiya weapons status.
-Commanded.

153
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,640 
If you allow, what is this?

154
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:22,080 
To join Anatolia to Rumelia and creating
of a vast empire Khalil Pasha.

155
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:29,000 
I understand the hint, but I fear that we want to expand,
we can also disappear.

156
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:37,080 
To stay in one place is like death to my people
must take bold decisions.

157
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:45,800 
The teacher taught me something once,
"To write history is not for cowards."

158
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:09,920 
Leave it in place! Stay not run!
Get him!
160
00:27:14,000 -> 00:27:18,900
Many apologies.

159
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,480 
Where is the boy?

160
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,640 
Where is the bastard?

161
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,480 
Let's run!

162
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,720 
How was your trip?
Without you, it was nice.

163
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,240 
But it was not bad.

164
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,800 
There was a storm at one time.
-Really?

165
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,200 
I found the book you wanted.

166
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,200 
Tell what Duke said?

167
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,440 
Not interested in sketches our Dad.

168
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,120 
Not understand their value.

169
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,120 
He wants to pouring piece for his army.

170
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,720 
Just go to hell! Do not know that anyone
weapons will not do more?

171
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,720 
Well how Justinian, what?

172
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,040 
One thing, however I ask your hand.

173
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,040 
And you refused him again right?

174
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:34,840 
Constantine gives Orhan dinner tonight after dinner
to see.

175
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,040 
For our Turkish friends!

176
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:59,160 
Karamanoglu Ibrahim was in preparation for war with Sultan Mehmed.

177
00:29:59,200 --> 00:18:36,120 
If there is strong support, who do you think will win,
Shehzade Orhan?

178
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,040 
Naturally Karamanoglu.

179
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,160 
You do not just know we all think so.

180
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,840 
To sit on his throne hereditary, you should only
one thing.

181
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,560 
Helping Karamanoglu Ibrahim Bey.

182
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,000 
I'm ready for anything!

183
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:35,080 
Write a letter to Karamanoglu that we, Hungarians, Latins, the pope
are on his side.

184
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,960 
You promise to his land.

185
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:46,480 
If you do this, I will take responsibility
to send them the letter.

186
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,840 
And the rest will sit down and watch with pleasure.

187
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:38,160 
The letter written by Orhan for Karamanoglu, my Sultan.

188
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:48,800 
Bravo!
-Suppose that the second group delegates already arrived to Karamanoglu.

189
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:18,880 
Our plan worked, Karamanoglu Ibrahim started the uprising.

190
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:24,000 
The trap we fell. If Karamanoglu beat is sarsheno
with him.

191
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:31,720 
It is not important whether you win, what matters is the army of Murad
losing positions. And you can not resist us.

192
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,760 
It will also double money for Orhan
of 600,000.

193
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,880 
You also will accept.

194
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:51,240 
By increasing my treasury, no reputation
will completely evaporate.

195
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,240 
<i> Beystvo Karamanoglu</i>
Akshehir 1451g. </ I>

196
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:12,760 
You Halil Pasha was on our side?
Without his help, it is not possible to collect such an army!

197
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:19,440 
The letter was a big lie deceived us.
-If we fight, victory is impossible.

198
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:30,880 
Karamanoglu Ibrahim, wanted peace!
If we now leave it as soon as possible, it will be refunded!

199
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:39,920 
A country can not afford, if we fight with someone who wants peace
our army will endure serious damage.

200
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,920 
Accept the proposal from Lord!

201
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,560 
Nonsense! Your political understanding is based
a cowardly act!

202
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:52,800 
And I'm on the side of the Vizier, I think you will not find
courage to recover soon.

203
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,800 
When marshirovame to Constantinople, it will not be an obstacle.

204
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,600 
Go! Send this hypocrite here.

205
00:34:09,640 --> 00:35:12,520 
Take it inside.

206
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,080 
Stand up.

207
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:39,360 
Do not Forget!
War with everyone, but peace with decent people do!

208
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:47,120 
I swear on my pride while I'm alive
will not shed blood between us!

209
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:55,200 
I swear on the pride that will carry
the end of his days.

210
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:05,360 
Or your death will be my hands.
Who knows? Maybe your destiny is one.

211
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,960 
My Sultan!
-Read.

212
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:43,080 
Constantine wants to double the money
we pay for Orhan, Lord.

213
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:53,160 
There is no reason to do this.
But neither the place nor the time!

214
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,800 
He wants to take advantage of our campaign!

215
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,840 
Get out!
Lala (gl.vezir) you stay.

216
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,160 
You also friendly behavior, otherwise attributed to him?

217
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,000 
You neither strength nor courage lack?

218
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,840 
Is that what you understand by friendship Lala?
Is this?

219
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,560 
Come here!

220
00:37:42,000 --> 00:35:50,360 
Before the march fell into my hands a letter to Orhan
Ibrahim, read!

221
00:37:50,920 --> 00:38:03,960 
I am surprised by the sentence to Orhan Ibrahim.
"Chief Vizier Halil Pasha was also with me."

222
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,640 
But for now, must keep it secret.

223
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,960 
Allah is my witness! I have nothing to do with it!

224
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:26,000 
Throughout his life, no moment is not separated
the way your father and you.

225
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:37,280 
In return we'll talk in Edirne
more seriously in this tema.Svoboden her.

226
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,000 
<i> With this letter, Mehmed Pasha, Halil pressed. </ i></i>

227
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,520 
<i> wanted to remove his power over the Janissaries. </ i></i>

228
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:50,280 
When asked <i> Janissaries arrogant money</i>
after it had been, </ i>

229
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:55,000 
<i> he immediately used vozmozhnostta. </ i></i>

230
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:03,360 
<i> and punished with the main battle Janissaries who</i>
people are the chief vizier. </ i>

231
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:10,840 
These dvulichnitsi send them into exile.
As Lord-favored combination.

232
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:17,880 
Every blow they receive is actually for me.

233
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,080 
Karamanoglu was! Cowards! Surrendered without a fight.

234
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,120 
Sultan Mehmed saw that we mirolyubivostta fraud.

235
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,280 
It is no longer young. He won his first campaign.

236
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:47,600 
Be sure not to send even half
the money for Orhan.

237
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,480 
Why still vainly blame?

238
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,160 
How can you write such a letter?

239
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,040 
With what audacity using my name?

240
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,440 
I am sure that the Sultan was aware of the lie.
Even if not, can not hurt.

241
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:26,040 
You can not afford internal problems in the state.

242
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:33,320 
Emine wrong, the state step by step, passing
in his hands.

243
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,240 
Sultan Pasha has called you!

244
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,320 
Allah! At that time?

245
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:45,640 
This tradition in our state has one explanation.

246
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,120 
Go, fetch my shroud.

247
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:59,000 
Prayer, I am a witness that no god but Allah,
I witness that no other prophet than Mohammed.

248
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,160 
Walk.

249
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,280 
Give him water.

250
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:40,600 
I never doubted your loyalty.
If it were otherwise, I would take your head.

251
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,800 
Surrender of Constantine, they would no longer pay.

252
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,000 
As you wish Lord.

253
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,720 
Come here.

254
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:14,840 
What do you see?
-This is a fort built by Sultan Bayazid.

255
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:24,360 
Now what you see?
New Fort in Rumelia Lord.

256
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:32,280 
Right here we will build the new fort.
These two towers, your people will build.

257
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:43,720 
The first stone, the Byzantines, the Pope and all other
will understand what we want to do Lord.

258
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,960 
Will join and will attack us.

259
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:56,760 
Neither Latins nor pope, nor Constantine ...

260
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:05,600 
I only think, for my people,
who does not see opportunities like conquer Constantinople.

261
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:21,000 
Not ever going to shed blood, but whether it will be martyred,
or vain? This is the question.

262
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:33,400 
<i> Boazkesen</i>
April 1452g. </ I>

263
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,520 
Our Sultan! (Peaceful)

264
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,280 
Work!

265
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:23,480 
Came to our noses and build a fort!
-You break the ships of the Black Sea.

266
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,200 
We'll make you starve!
-Prepare for attack.

267
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:34,280 
We need to prepare for war.

268
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,720 
Tell my brothers. Collect armies
and to come here.

269
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:47,920 
Tell Justinian if commanding my army
will receive the island of Limnos.

270
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,720 
What was the name of the master piece?
Urban-Lord.

271
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,640 
Make him finally to make cannons for us!

272
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:14,120 
You were right by building this fort, intentions
Sultan Mehmed clarified.

273
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:22,240 
The Pope should take action if we collect
strong army of crusaders, Mehmed will abandon the attack.

274
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:30,600 
So Constantine will sign the contract
for not joining the Orthodox Church to the Vatican.

275
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:38,520 
But Frenchmen and Englishmen were at war,
Their armies are worse condition.

276
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,560 
A German Emperor has internal problems to the throne.

277
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:47,680 
Sultan Mehmed knows it all.
Planned on it that is

278
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:52,200 
Yes, but the pope could convince the Venetians.

279
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:59,080 
To send a messenger to Constantine.
-Right. Needs to know about our efforts.

280
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:06,760 
Sultan mine, to 11 months will build a fort.
-You have five months.

281
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:13,440 
To prevent aid to Constantinople
have to take under control the Bosphorus.

282
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,680 
If you all will carry stones.

283
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:26,720 
Just as expected, Constantine sought help
from his brothers.

284
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:38,000 
Sad but I see that you want to disconnect my
the Black Sea, will prevent our trade!

285
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,680 
Your destination is more than clear.

286
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,280 
Think you can skip my walls.

287
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,000 
As your father and you will be dissatisfied.

288
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:00,880 
Something that has nothing to do with us because of a letter
written without our knowledge ...

289
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,120 
you stopped the money you pay for Orhan.

290
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:18,560 
To continue the peaceful days between us, we did not
opposed to this.

291
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:24,240 
But if you do not immediately stop the construction, I will send Orhan
in Edirne ...

292
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:29,240 
I'll do anything to him the throne!

293
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:42,960 
Also, if you think that the pope and the Latins
will tolerate this, you're wrong.

294
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,720 
Meet the largest army of crusaders in history!

295
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,200 
He would raise Orhan.

296
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:03,200 
To stop the intrigues that spanned centuries.
My people and the army are with me, he knows it.

297
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:08,280 
The pope was to gather an army to collect
to see.

298
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:14,560 
We beat them in Varna and Kosovo
I will beat them.

299
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:20,440 
I, I do not look like Sultans before me.

300
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,360 
I am the Sultan Mehmed Khan.

301
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:29,880 
This is my land and this will make a fort!

302
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:36,840 
Everything is my land,
is under my power!

303
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,680 
<i> Mora </ i></i>

304
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:29,360 
I will not stop building?
-Collected a large army.

305
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,960 
I will burn him and his army.

306
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,640 
The pope promised military aid.

307
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:41,440 
But they want the union of our church.

308
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:46,240 
Why not send Orhan in Edirne?
To provoke the anger of people against Mehmed.

309
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,440 
This is impossible, all with Mehmed

310
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:54,880 
Then why keep Orhan here?
-Mehmet will not break our walls.

311
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:59,240 
The last day will f
And then we'll need Orhan.

312
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,240 
Cannons prepare you?
Renewal-end, Emperor.

313
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,600 
Welcome!
-Thank you.

314
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,720 
Dad and salt to take.
Well-daughter.

315
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,960 
Urban Master!
Grand Duke Notarez you cried.

316
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,120 
Dad?
You go home, my daughter, do not worry.

317
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,880 
Welcome to Urban Master!

318
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,440 
As you know, our city is preparing for war.

319
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,480 
This is not my war.

320
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:53,720 
All Christians need to perform their duty.
And you so!

321
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,560 
I have neither the strength nor the desire to pour guns.
Excuse me.

322
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:04,760 
Think about your beautiful daughter
nobody wants it to happen!

323
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:10,320 
By morning you have time to change your mind.
Now go away.

324
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:19,800 
Hurry! Before placing dogs Notarez,
gotta move on.

325
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:31,040 
Are detained under the direction of Grand Duke Notarez!
Get him!

326
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,640 
Stop! Stop!

327
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,880 
Leave my daughter!
-Get your hands dirty!

328
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,200 
Sultan Mehmed wanted to see
Master in Urban palace.

329
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:44,360 
We learned that the Turks were kidnapped Urban.
-Will make his guns and will destroy our walls.

330
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:48,680 
Find a way to kill Urban.

331
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,360 
Came news of your brethren great emperors.

332
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:58,680 
Mehmed forces have destroyed their end.

333
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:05,120 
Their armies were defeated!

334
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,200 
Unfit Turk!
Always one step ahead of me!

335
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:21,840 
Sorry to forcibly make you come
to Edirne.

336
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,240 
Actually, you did a great kindness to us.

337
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,000 
To help you Sultana will close
one of my old account.

338
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,880 
What account?

339
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:41,960 
Years ago, krastinostsite supported by Constantine.
The campaign to expel you from the Balkans ...

340
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:47,040 
Destroyed all Muslim villages on their way.

341
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:53,000 
One of them was our village.

342
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,680 
Killed my whole family.

343
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:52,400 
I woke up in the slave market in Constantinople.

344
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:09,280 
If Urban was not bought me ...
-It is not your father right?

345
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,840 
As my father is,

346
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,280 
Since that day, he is the father.

347
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:22,800 
Come start leem cannon.

348
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,720 
I'm good as my father.

349
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:35,520 
Girl in the arms factory?
-Do not worry, nobody will ever know.

350
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,520 
Let's go, come on Dad.

351
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,160 
We did not stay another choice.

352
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:03,280 
Write a letter to the pope, I am ready to do
common ritual between Catholics and Orthodox.

353
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:10,840 
We must unite and to fight
our biggest enemy, the Antichrist.

354
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:16,440 
If you call them will be gone from our town!

355
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:23,880 
Did you forget our past!? Will also damaging to the faith
us and our city.

356
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,800 
Mehmed, in the near future we will attack
no time to lose!

357
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:34,280 
I beg your Great Emperor!
This decision will give our church the Pope!

358
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,240 
This would be the end of our religion!

359
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:44,560 
I prefer the Turks than Latin.

360
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:50,960 
We do not want to see false Catholics
The Hagia Sophia!

361
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,080 
I will not betray their religion in the hands of the Pope!

362
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:58,840 
I will not pray with them!
-Do not want to "St. Sofia"!

363
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,280 
They want to take our faith!

364
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:10,080 
Time to say stop the Catholics,
that feed on our blood!

365
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:00,360 
Master Urban, I am glad to see you
wizard and you to me.

366
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,960

00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:09,160 
I want to pouring huge cannon which will in
history, vouchsafed to break the walls of Constantinople!

368
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:17,480 
As you wish.
-Hassan will always be with you, for your security needs.

369
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:23,200 
Do you easily.
-Thank you.

370
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:32,280 
Lord! Bless our work, we were not ashamed!.

371
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:38,120 
Bless our victorious army!
-Amen.

372
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:54,640 
Prayer "Strength and power can only be achieved through
the great and supreme God "

373
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:58,880 
Allah is great!
-God is great!

374
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:17,080 
Do you need help Ilyaz master?
-What?

375
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:21,200 
Among this crowd of men, we
they can call Age.

376
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,080 
Close your mouth!
Not only do I look like a boy!

377
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:29,480 
Beautiful as it was in its market
I think.

378
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:25,920 
<i> Boazkesen,</i>
September 1452g. </ I>

379
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:42,640 
The Turks have created a miracle.
Look, this is a sign to stop!

380
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:52,240 
That they want does not mean that we stop!

381
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,000 
Dive!

382
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,120 
<i> County Genoa </ i></i>

383
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:09,520 
How will my ship sink?
-Prepare to besiege Constantinople.

384
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:14,480 
It interferes with our trade,
also fought with us!

385
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,880 
We can not afford direct combat.

386
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,840 
I can go and army commander Constantine.

387
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:34,880 
Brace yourself now!
-As you wish, my Lord.

388
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:46,560 
It was to be close Black
commercial time to think of to help.

389
01:01:50,160 --> 01:02:02,480 
And you, dear priyateli.Vyarvam that
will be able to unite Catholics and Orthodox.

390
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:10,480 
If you what I can find the strength to
save the city.

391
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:15,760 
I will send a large detachment of archers with you
in Constantinople.

392
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:22,120 
To achieve his goal, people
have to believe in you.

393
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:31,880 
God bless you.

394
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:55,080 
As I decided to pour gun again
shy that I can not do it.

395
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:01,960 
But now ... Well that convinced me daughter.
-I know you do it for me daddy.

396
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:08,240 
I looked again to the drawings.
Well, Dad.

397
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:24,160 
I am grateful to His Excellency.

398
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:29,600 
Your presence has helped morale of the people
and strength of my army.

399
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,440 
The truth is that you need more help
Emperor.

400
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:41,480 
If you want help from Catholics for the godless Turks
know what to do.

401
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:52,160 
For a long time by repeating insistently
The Pope is to join the Orthodox to the Vatican.

402
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:01,600 
To silence Genadeus would not be
problem for the powerful emperor as yours.

403
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,320 
We will do whatever it takes.

404
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:13,200 
My people! Emperor who sold his soul
The Pope, how will keep our faith?

405
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:21,480 
He fell on his knees before the Pope and
sell our religion!

406
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:28,120 
Not our tradition, and Catholic action
to pray.

407
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:35,120 
They want to rule the Orthodox!

408
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,320 
They will let you do that?
-No ...

409
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,000 
Think again about this decision, my Sultan.

410
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:04,320 
We know that the Pope has sent a detachment of archers.

411
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,640 
Armies will come from Venice and Genoa.

412
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:16,560 
German, English and French soldiers will come with
security.

413
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:22,240 
Englishmen and Frenchmen almost destroyed his army.

414
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:27,000 
A German king, dealing with internal problems.

415
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:33,920 
Should not you know it better than us Lala?

416
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,520 
They listened to enough. Reshenieto my final.

417
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:44,360 
It is time to consider their own interests to
conquest of Constantinople.

418
05:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,480 
Or ...

419
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:53,560 
Zanos, our spies contact Genadeus.

420
01:05:53,640 --> 01:06:00,880 
As the time comes, will be able to pray
no Catholic natisk.Obeshtavam.

421
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:09,680 
Also, tell Urban ready with cannon.
Within two months go on the march.

422
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:23,040 
After much dust and smoke, this is wonderful.

423
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:29,680 
Thank you Hassan.
-I do not think you ate a delicious fish before.

424
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,120 
Very tasty smells.
There, ginger and bay leaf.

425
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:38,760 
I learned it from his father.
-Not the story of your family.

426
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:43,280 
My mother died when I was very small.

427
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:51,800 
My father was a great soldier, we were together
in Kosovo, and killed him there.

428
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,680 
Wanna try it?

429
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:07,600 
It is delicious! But I learned the secret of your fish.
-You will teach me how to pour cannon.

430
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:13,480 
It does not learn as easily as it is
arts.

431
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:16,480 
This is the fourth attempt, iron is not pure enough.

432
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:25,600 
Why stubborn dad? You can put tin.
-Know that will solidify before it gets into the matrix.

433
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:30,440 
If efforts fire will have no such problem.

434
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:38,840 
Fire is sufficient daughter.
-Let's try, the pots will last!

435
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:43,600 
No, too risky!
However, you say no!

436
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:00,160 
Dear Giovanni Justinian.
-Emperor!

437
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:06,360 
You come to support us against the faithless.

438
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:13,080 
You and your army is very valuable to us.

439
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:17,520 
We are grateful to be here, but ...

440
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:25,760 
But let's not forget the past when they
Our armies looted the city.

441
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:33,880 
Do you think that you are unfair to
army that came to save your city?

442
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:44,360 
Our people will evaluate everything they do Notarez.

443
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,000 
No doubt about it!

444
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:54,400 
You may be right.
-Very few copper have Dad.

445
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:59,480 
Tomorrow will bring.
Night-workers will now come masters.

446
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,680 
You get some rest craftsman Mahmut, we will stay.
-Okay.

447
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:08,560 
Father, let us go out early.

448
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:28,760 
This is the work of Notarez.
Thanks Hassan.

449
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:34,840 
Before falling walls,
will not have peace!

450
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,040 
Hassan!

451
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:57,240 
What do you think Dad?
-We did it this time, thanks to you!

452
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,480 
Well, we made an agreement with the Serbs and Hungarians Lord.

453
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,080 
So we will not have any problems during the siege.

454
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:20,920 
Thanks for the valuable gifts that you sent to them.

455
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:21,480 
All right.

456
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:26,560 
Khalil Pasha realized that nothing is bothering you.

457
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:31,600 
Armies come there?
-Will soon arrive in Edirne.

458
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:36,720 
A ship?
-Will be ready Sultan added.

459
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:55,040 
"Poem"

460
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:22,240 
What perfume you want to put it?

461
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,480 
Yasmin.

462
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,560 
He likes the most.

463
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:17,720 
This amulet took it from my father
Having killed him.

464
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,240 
So I can give it a brave man like him.

465
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:32,680 
I will always wear it.

466
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:38,040 
Today is the big day, I'm worried. And you?
- I.

467
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:45,560 
I do not want to come to the siege Era.

468
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,920 
You know it will come. And before we spoke.

469
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:55,400 
You do not want to happen.

470
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:01,640 
And I do not wanna happen.
And you do not you go then.

471
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:07,040 
War is not for women Era.

472
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:13,240 
NOT for women right?!
Have you forgotten what I've gone through?

473
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:16,880 
They killed my mother and sisters in the war.

474
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:21,600 
There were soldiers, and killed them in our own house.

475
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:25,240 
In war men die with pride, women ...

476
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:29,160 
They lose their dignity, their children, everything!

477
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:36,840 
I will go to this war!
Nobody can stop me!

478
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:03,640 
My compliments Urban Master!
-Thank you.

479
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,960 
A good time!

480
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:25,680 
I thought his se.Prava. I was selfish, I'm sorry.

481
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:44,640 
<i> Gelibolu </ i></i>

482
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:57,440 
Allah is great!

Dad!

489
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:40,320 
I wrote it for you.

490
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:31,560 
Precious commanders! Brave soldiers! Full of faith folks!

491
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:39,480 
We are under the protection of the Virgin Mary!

492
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:43,960 
Find the courage to threaten us again!

493
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:49,640 
-Fucking Turks!

494
01:22:49,680 --> 01:23:00,400 
Incorrect Turks are going to us
to pierce their venomous teeth in our throats!

495
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:09,360 
They think they will be able to pass the strongest
walls of history!

496
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:14,440 
But we will drown in their own blood!

497
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:25,120 
Children of Constantinople! I believe that each of you
will fight to the last blood!

498
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:36,360 
And I will write a new story!
God is with us!

499
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:14,040 
This gate is your Nikolamus.
Door Kreska - Commander Kontarini!

500
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:18,240 
-As initiate Emperor!

01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:25,720 
Justinian, and your squad of archers keep
Romanos gate!

502
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:32,520 
This is our weakest spot.
If you enter, you will first fight!

503
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:38,000 
Do not worry. I will not let
and a Turk to enter!

504
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:44,000 
Orhan Shehzade will keep port Lang.
Aye-Emperor!

505
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:48,840 
God to protect our city.

506
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:37,360 
Karadja grazing from Edirne to Ayvansaray is yours.
-As initiate my Sultan!

507
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:42,640 
Shehabettin grazing, they want you to curve the neck.

508
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:49,240 
Suleiman Pasha fleet should take Halich!
The walls are weakest there!

509
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,560 
Zanos, you will keep Galata hills!

510
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:58,360 
Hassan, you will command the best warriors.

511
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:04,600 
You and the horsemen will not attack before falling walls!

512
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:08,800 
You are free!

513
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:19,160 
Attacked us in our most sacred day.
To shake our faith.

514
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:27,680 
But it will bring him bloody,
a victory for us!

515
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:40,880 
What we will only look at it?
Do not trust the promises of the Turks there?

516
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:49,840 
Better than the Pope, believe.
However, you must protect your city.

517
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,000 
<i> April 6 1453g.</i>
Friday </ i>

Selamin aleykyum.
Kalos-andromosikan.

519
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:55,160 
I wanted to welcome you in the palace of Sultan Mehmed.

520
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:59,760 
But you're quite welcome.

521
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,440 
Thanks for the hospitality of the Emperor Constantine.

522
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:05,080 
I have come to welcome you in this palace.

523

I remind you that any force in history has failed
pass our walls Sultan Mehmed.

524
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:16,680 
After us will remain one to this recall.

525
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:21,000 
The walls of our town have heard it before.
Latest from your father.

526
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:24,080 
But he refused.

527
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:28,480 
We came to finish it.

528
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:36,480 
If you pass the town, the people will not lose
si.Shte property is completely away from any problems.

529
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:40,480 
In this case, much blood will flow, your blood.

530
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:45,480 
We follow the path of the Qur'an.

531
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:21,480 
Barriers!

532
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:28,480

01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:01,480 
Archers!
Shoot!

536
01:30:17,080 --> 01:28:28,480 
Great tool!

537
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:51,480 
Unable to kill a master!

538
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:56,480 
Archers!

539
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:32,480

Bring stones! Faster!

540
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:55,480 
Shoot!

541
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:16,480 
Close the gap!

Not forgotten era are still right?

543
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:27,480 
Well Ayvansaray?
Same-Sultan added.

544
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,480 
We were unable to either front.

545
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:35,880 
Very large losses have a Lord.

546
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:43,480 
We are trying to penetrate by Halich,
but as we get closer, our fleet firing their cannons.

547
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:49,480 
Our soldiers should not lie,
will think that we gave up!

548
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,480 
And I also want to consider Zanos.

549
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:59,480 
Tell channel master to dig faster.
Tomorrow will understand why my troops died.

550
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:16,480 
Report!
-We have enough tar and oil Emperor.

551
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:20,480 
There are no movements of the Ottoman army.

552
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:26,480 
Collect your luggage clearly.
Understood in what have come to Hell.

553
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:53,480 
We can not shoot often enough to
main gun.

554
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:57,480 
If this begins to work, you shoot 10 times a day.

555
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:07,480 
Turned my world.

556
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:15,480 
The fatigue that is going to

557
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:37,480 
Very little remained masters.

Let us out!
-Dig, faster!

Run out! Come on!

573
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:08,480 
I will not die in vain!

574
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:16,480 
Prayer, I am a witness that no god but Allah,
I witness that no other prophet than Mohammed.

575
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:21,480 
Allah is great!

576
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:28,480 
Run!
-God is great!

577
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:49,480 
<i> Twelfth day. </ i></i>

01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:53,080 
You summoned me.

579
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:56,480 
It was once said something Hassan.

580
01:41:56,480 --> 01:42:03,480 
"Wants to keep the sword skill.
Neither will many clenching or less will behave.

581

If clenching a lot, you will quickly tired arm.
You can not fast.

582
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:14,480 
If you behave poorly in the first blow will
stay without a sword. "

583
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:18,480 
It is time to hold the sword properly Hassan.

584
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:22,480 
E.Podgotvete is your turn.
-As initiate Sultan added.

585
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:38,480 
This will now attack the towers.
We will be prepared.

586
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:42,480 
Be careful Hassan.

587
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:06,480 
Archers!

588
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:34,480 
Bump the door!
AZ Allah! January Allah!

Die!
We gotta get out of the tower!

593
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:27,480 
Faster!

594
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:39,480 
Do not close anymore!

595
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:47,480 
Push!

596
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:51,480 
Light!

597
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:30,480 
I saw Yustiniyan.Opasen and good soldier.

598
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:34,480 
If it were not here, maybe we
to enter.

599
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:38,480 
Watch him Hasan.

600
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:50,480 
I was in all fronts
There was no major damage.

601
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:57,480 
If we compare with the Turkish defeat.
-Were against the help of the Pope.

602
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:01,480 
But as you can see the Turks lost everywhere.

603
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:06,480 
To completely get rid of them
Pope should put more effort.

604
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:10,480 
You must pritisnem army of Mehmed
walls between us and the Crusaders.

605
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:17,480 
Do not worry, Pope convince Hungarians.

606
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:32,480 
Well, leave it to us.

607
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:43,480 
If I die, I have one wish.

608
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:48,480 
Nothing will happen to you, do not worry.

609
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:52,480 
I will fulfill my desire, tell me!?

610
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:56,480 
Tell your desire.

611
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:09,480 
If you see my beloved, tell her that I
died with dignity.

612
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:16,480 
By bugger the beat
will tell her how you been.

613
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:23,080 
I am Hungarian king Ladistas.
Fired his attorney.

614
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:29,080 
Announce you that the peace agreement
is not valid anymore.

615
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:35,080 
And I hope to soon time to quit
of siege.

616
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:42,080 
Remember how much pain and suffering
cause if our armies meet.

617
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:50,080 
Tell the king that he would expect it
with his army here.

618
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:56,080 
Sultan mine, from the very beginning I said that
strike is wrong.

619
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:59,080 
On the whole month here.

620
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:02,080 
Army gave us enormous sacrifices.

621
01:51:02,200 --> 01:50:10,080 
If the Hungarians come ...
-They only threaten Lala.

622
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:08,080 
Even if true, they come when we
long will we have taken the city.

623
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:12,080 
If not we will fight with Constantine and
Hungarians.

624
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:19,080 
Now go and tell them to shoot more often with guns.

625
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:32,080 
Hungarian king his promise.
-Very nice.

626
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:40,080 
As troops come, not only
protect their city, but will erase the memory of the Turks in history.

627
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:49,080 
Are you sure we can shoot more often?
Do not worry, Dad, the mixture will work hard.

628
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:54,080 
Put gunpowder master Mahmut!
-Done!

629
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:59,080 
And you bring more of the mixture for subsequent shots.

630
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:04,080 
Tighten firmly on guys!

631
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:13,080 
Dad!
-Master!?

632
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:10,080 
Pull up!

633
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:20,080 
Dad opened his eyes!
-Call a doctor!

634
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:26,080 
This is my fault.

635
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:29,080 
What if you had died?

636
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:34,080 
Our Sultan!
-Go on!

637
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:45,080 
When will I be okay?
Until a few days, Lord.

638
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:49,080 
The main gun must be corrected in
soon.

639
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:59,080 
He did not think I'll fix it.

640
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:17,080 
To run some of them that the Turks have morals.
Yes, we were dead!

641
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:24,080 
Go!

642
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:07,080 
Get out of my eyes!

643
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:30,080 
Why not leave yet?
-Unable to accept that it is defeated.

644
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:34,080 
Hungarians come, hopefully
still be here.

645
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:38,080 
I'll clean his boots with his clothes.

646
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:48,080 
Welcome to Ak-Sheikh. I had to call you.

647
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:54,080 
With no one spoke.
In his chambers, you? Yes.

648
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:59,080 
Two days does not go.
Our troops are restless.

649
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:21,600 
Ak Sheikh! Welcome!

650
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:25,600 
Well he found Mehmed.

651
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:30,600 
What is it? Why your army does not fight?

652
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:33,600 
40 days here.

653
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:37,600 
Patience is the second name of the person.

654
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:40,600 
It keeps alive and your goal and dreams.

655
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:50,600 
Failures, as in you and in your army
have created great sadness.

656
02:01:51,600 --> 02:01:55,600 
Hurt is the desire to fight.

657
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:59,600 
And unbelievers celebrate with joy.

658
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:06,600 
Mehmed Come, come with me.

659
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:21,600 
Before I came here three days, I prayed.

660
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:34,600 
And last night, St. Ebu Eyyub el-Ensari came in my dream.

661
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:40,600 
He told me where his grave.
He told me to show you the place.

662
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:47,600 
Why lie so close to its walls tell.

663
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:36,600 
You know, St. Eyyub with Islamic army was involved in
siege of Constantinople.

664
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:44,600 
And do not go before you die before these walls.
It was young as you.

665
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:50,600 
It was old and ill.

666
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:55,600 
You can not deny Mehmet!

667
02:03:55,600 --> 02:04:00,600 
You came here as a herald ruler.

668
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:03,600 
You have to go with his troops.

669
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:09,600 
If you do not now, never
to you.

670
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:19,600 
Find Forces perk. And show
leadership skills of your opponents!

671
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:23,600 
You have this power Mehmed.

672
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:32,600 
Do not forget! Strong winds only in
high mountains wave.

673
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:46,600 
I will not die before you conquer the city Dad!

674
02:06:46,600 --> 02:04:52,600 
Made in the land of ships that entered
in Halich!

675
02:06:54,600 --> 02:07:00,600 
As we think will be denied ...
-The people and our army is restless Lord.

676
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:06,600 
This is not good.
-He wants to reach the weakest points in our walls.

677
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:12,600 
Our ships could not sink them.
Bombard us with reams of Galata.

678
02:07:13,600 --> 02:07:16,600 
You should send troops to Halich.

679
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:19,600 
If we send out there in other places will lose weight.

680
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:25,600 
We will build a bridge of ships and troops will spend!

681
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:29,600 
These Hungarians still did not come!
, Justinian!

682
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:33,600 
Immediately send troops to Halich.

683
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:41,600 
Notarez! Find Genadeus, and say to
raise the morale of the people.

684
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:19,600 
I came to ask for something on behalf of
Genadeus emperor.

685
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:22,600 
He sold me the religion of the Pope.
He's not my emperor.

686
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:26,600 
You know I think like you.

687
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:32,600 
But in these difficult days should help.
The people are scared.

688
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:35,600 
Do not you see?

689
02:08:35,600 --> 02:08:38,600 
Use the power over people.

690
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:44,600 
I do enough, but sold to Orthodox Catholics ...

691
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:54,600 
And all these things happen, made
beliefs of the people to go off as the lights of St. Sophia.

692
02:08:54,600 --> 02:08:58,600 
All are helpless.

693
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:08,600 
My heroes!

694
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:13,600 
Our past is full of win!

695
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:16,600 
We took the hardest castles and cities!

696
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:19,600 
We crossed the high mountains!

697
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:26,600 
I broke the swords of their enemies!

698
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:32,600 
We took their flags!

699
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:44,600 
Today! We will prove our ancestors,
that we are worthy successors!

700
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:51,600 
Do not forget! Large gains are
achieved with faith!

701
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:58,600 
I know our courage will cross these walls!

702
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:06,600 
By morning, will open the eyes of a
wonderful day!

703
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:13,600 
I will not drink sherbet success before
Defeat your enemies!

704
02:10:14,600 --> 02:10:30,600 
Allah is great!
-God is great!

705
02:10:39,600 --> 02:10:42,600 
I was looking for you.

706
02:10:56,600 --> 02:11:02,600 
Tomorrow we will see!

707
02:11:03,600 --> 02:11:08,600 
We will avenge you and Era.

708
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:33,600 
Hassan!

709
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:57,600 
<i> May 29, 1453</i>
Tuesday </ i>

710
02:11:58,600 --> 02:12:10,600 
<i> Morning church service (flat) </ i></i>

711
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:39,600 
Today will be the greatest attack.
If we win this war would end.

712
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:45,600 
The people you will celebrate our victory!

713
02:12:58,600 --> 02:13:05,600 
<i> May Allah (the force) be with you ... (Arabic) </ i></i>

714
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:16,600 
Another brother did not stay.

715
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:19,600 
This time could not find us.

716
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:30,600 
I do not want mistakes! Get out!

717
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:54,600 
Fire!

718
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:03,600 
Attack!

719
02:14:48,600 --> 02:13:52,600 
It should be away from here Lord.

720
02:14:52,600 --> 02:13:55,600 
You should go back to the palace.

721
02:14:55,600 --> 02:15:00,600 
While it away, you must
in a safe place.

722
02:16:07,600 --> 02:16:13,600 
Remember the promise of my favorite!

723
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:21,600 
You'll find her, tell her that he died with dignity!

724
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:30,600 
Climb the tower!

725
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:41,600 
This death will be difficult for you!
The winners write history!

726
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:47,600 
With us not forget the fallen!
But now you die!

727
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:14,600 
Flee, save your life!

728
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:26,600 
Divine Light of the people and our army
I think I pulled into Heaven.

729
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:31,600 
You must leave town Emperor.

730
02:22:32,600 --> 02:22:37,600 
Divine light ...

731
02:22:38,600 --> 02:22:43,600 
Climbed at a much higher place Notarez.

732
02:22:44,600 --> 02:22:49,600 
For dignity,
must fight all the way!

733
02:23:04,600 --> 02:23:08,600 
Kill him!

734
02:23:13,600 --> 02:23:17,600 
Do not let him off our flag!

735
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:23,600 
The Emperor is dead!

736
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:28,600 
Detained you!

737
02:26:42,600 --> 02:22:45,600 
Long live the Sultan!
-Long live the Sultan!

738
02:26:48,600 --> 02:26:52,600 
Stand up.

739
02:26:53,600 --> 02:26:59,600 
Bury Emperor, upon your faith.

740
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:25,600 
Do not panic!

741
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:34,600 
We are a nation anymore.
Property is one thing, our destinies are one.

742
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:49,600 
You are free to keep their religion.

743
