SONIA:
I was safe in the darkness.

1036
01:13:46,932 --> 01:13:50,811
I feel safety in the quietness,

1037
01:13:50,979 --> 01:13:53,063
and sometimes, you know,

SAM: The Russians...
they bombed the Germans,

1040
01:14:02,198 --> 01:14:03,699
so we stayed inside,

1041
01:14:05,493 --> 01:14:08,162
and we told this guy
that if the Russians come in,

1042
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:10,956
he should put a note
and put it on a string

1043
01:14:11,124 --> 01:14:12,666

One day, I come out,
and there it is.

01:14:25,013 --> 01:14:27,723
Oh, what a noise.

1047
01:14:27,891 --> 01:14:31,268
Everybody was yelling
and crying and...

1048
01:14:32,562 --> 01:14:34,605
and we were liberated.

Not one person came out
to greet us and say, "Hey. "

SAUL: And we had a dog
before we left,

a beautiful German shepherd.

I feel like I did something good.

1066
01:17:01,672 --> 01:17:04,090
I went to Ukraine
looking for my family's story,
