I didn't know it was so bad.

8
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,840
A couple of incendiaries,
these old buildings go up like Cellophane.

9
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,280
A wall separates the old section
of Nuremberg from the new.

10
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,520
It goes back to...
How far does it go back, Schmidt?

11
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,040
- 1219, sir.
- 1219.

12
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,040
This is where the Nazi party
held their rallies, isn't it?

13
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,240
They all came here.
Hitler, Goebbels, the whole crew.

14
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,000
Thousands of them,
from all over Germany.

<i>(horn)</i>

16
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,240
Does he have to blow
that damn horn so much?

17
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,720
It's not necessary
to blow the horn so much, Schmidt.

18
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,200
<i>- You both know your duties?
- Ja.</i>

19
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,400
Well, here we are.
A little bit of old Germany.

20
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,280
- Senator Burkette.
- Captain Byers, this is Judge Haywood.

21
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,720
- Byers here will be your aide.
- My what?

22
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,360
Clerk, general guide, liaison.
Any capacity you wish to use me.

23
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,800
This will be your staff,
Mr and Mrs Halbestadt.

24
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,040
- Hello.
- Good afternoon.

25
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,120
Good afternoon, Your Honour.

26
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,640
- Welcome.
- You've met your driver, Schmidt.

27
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm at your service
any time you need me. Day or night.

28
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,760
Thanks.

29
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,360
Let's show him around
the rest of the place. Dan.

30
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,840
We're in the reception room.

31
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,160
Living room.
The study is in there.

32
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,120
There are two bedrooms on this floor,
three upstairs.

33
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,880
The furniture is part antique,
part US army.

34
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,560
The piano is showing signs of wear
and tear, but it's a genuine Bechstein.

35
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,520
- Quite a view, isn't it, sir?
- Yes.

36
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,120
Uh...

37
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,040
Senator,
I really, really don't need all this.

38
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,240
When the US government
does something, it does it right.

39
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,720
- Who used to live here?
- An important Nazi general and his wife.

40
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,480
Is there anything else
Judge Haywood ought to know?

41
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,640
- Sir, any questions?
- Yes, yes.

42
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,800
- You're West Point, aren't you?
- Yes.

43
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,880
- What's your first name?
- Harrison. Harry.

44
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,600
Well, Harry, look. I'm not West Point, and
all this formality kind of gets me down.

45
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,200
It puts me ill at ease. You think it would be
too much of an infraction of the rules

46
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,160
if you were to call me Judge
or Dan or something?

47
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,040
OK, Judge. We do all our shopping
at the army commissary.

48
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,000
There isn't enough food at the local
markets. The driver knows where it is.

49
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,000
Here's a copy
of the indictment of the case.

50
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,000
- Thanks.
- I hope you'll be comfortable here, sir.

51
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,720
Captain, I think the whole state
of Maine would be comfortable here.

52
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,600
My office is next to yours,
if you need anything.

53
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,680
- Thank you.
- Senator.

54
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,760
Do you think I need the three servants?
It kind of makes me feel like a damn fool.

55
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,200
Well, it helps them out as well as you.
You see, here they eat.

56
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,560
Oh.

57
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,600
Well, I need three servants.

58
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,320
It's good to have a man
of your stature here, Dan.

59
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,640
Sure. Sure. I was the only man
in America qualified for this job.

60
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,720
You know I wasn't the first choice,
nor even the tenth.

61
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,800
- You know it, I know it.
- What do you mean?

62
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,440
Let's face it. Hitler is gone, Goebbels is
gone, Göring is gone - committed suicide.

63
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,200
Now we're down to judging the doctors,
businessmen and judges.

64
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,840
- Some think they shouldn't be judged.
- So?

65
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,320
It makes for a lack
of candidates for the job.

66
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,840
You had to beat the backwoods of Maine
to come up with a hick like me.

67
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,080
- I hope you're not sorry you came.
- No, I'm not sorry I came.

68
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,000
I just wanted you to know
I know where the body is buried.

69
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,320
No, I think the trials should go on.

70
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,640
Especially the trials of the German
judges. I hope I'm up to it.

71
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,520
You're up to it.

72
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,680
Well, relax.
Enjoy this place while you can.

73
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,120
- You're gonna be a pretty busy fellow.
- Thanks, Senator.

74
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,440
See you tomorrow, Judge.

75
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,280
Shall we, uh, take these upstairs?

76
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,760
Oh, yes, thank you.

77
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,840
- Here, I can take that one.
- No, let me take it. Please.

78
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,480
<i>(man) Here they come.</i>

79
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,880
The tribunal is now in session.

80
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,280
God bless the United States
and this honourable tribunal.

81
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,440
The tribunal will now
arraign the defendants.

82
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,920
A microphone will be placed
in front of the defendant Emil Hahn.

83
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,520
Emil Hahn, are you represented
by counsel before this tribunal?

84
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,680
<i>(translates into German)</i>

85
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,960
<i>(speaks German)</i>

86
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,960
Not guilty.

87
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,080
The question was
are you represented by counsel?

88
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,640
<i>(translates into German)</i>

89
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,960
<i>(speaks German)</i>

90
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,120
I am represented.

91
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,720
How do you plead to the charges
and specifications in the indictment,

92
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,960
guilty or not guilty?

93
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,640
<i>(speaks German)</i>

94
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,560
Not guilty on all counts.

95
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,640
Friedrich Hofstetter.

96
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,800
Are you represented by counsel
before this tribunal?

97
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,560
<i>(speaks German)</i>

98
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,720
- I am represented.
- How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?

99
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,440
<i>Nicht schuldig.</i>

100
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,120
<i>(Haywood) You may be seated.</i>

101
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,280
Werner Lampe.

102
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,840
Are you represented by counsel
before this tribunal?

103
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,920
Counsel?

104
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,080
<i>(speaks German)</i>

105
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,360
Yes, yes, of course, I am represented.

106
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,160
How do you plead to the charges,
guilty or not guilty?

107
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,160
<i>Nicht schuldig.</i>

108
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,640
You may be seated.

109
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,280
Ernst Janning.

110
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:45,080
Ernst Janning, are you represented
by counsel before this tribunal?

111
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,480
Ernst Janning, are you represented
by counsel before this tribunal?

112
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,880
<i>(lawyer speaks German)</i>

113
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,320
I represent the defendant, Your Honour.

114
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,320
How do you plead
to the charges and specifications

115
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,480
set forth in the indictment against you,
guilty or not guilty?

116
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,280
<i>(speaks German)</i>

117
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,040
Your Honour, may I address the court?

118
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,840
<i>(speaks German)</i>

119
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,680
The defendant does not recognise
the authority of this tribunal

120
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
and wishes to lodge a formal protest.

121
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,160
A plea of not guilty will be entered.

122
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,400
The prosecution will begin
its opening address.

123
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,720
Slow and easy, Junior.

124
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,240
The case is unusual, in that
the defendants are charged with crimes

125
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,000
committed in the name of the law.

126
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,720
These men, together with
their deceased or fugitive colleagues,

127
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:45,400
are the embodiment of what passed
for justice during the Third Reich.

128
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,680
The defendants served as judges
during the period of the Third Reich.

129
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,280
Therefore you, Your Honours,
as judges on the bench,

130
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,320
will be sitting in judgment
of judges in the dock.

131
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,200
And this is as it should be.

132
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:09,000
For only a judge knows how much more
a court is than a courtroom.

133
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,800
It is a process and a spirit.

134
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,800
It is the house of law.

135
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,480
The defendants knew this too.
They knew courtrooms well.

136
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,960
They sat in their black robes
and they distorted, they perverted,

137
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,800
they destroyed justice
and law in Germany.

138
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,480
The prosecution
will please watch the light.

139
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,080
- The interpreter cannot follow you.
- I'm sorry, Your Honour.

140
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,320
They distorted, they perverted,

141
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,000
they destroyed
justice and law in Germany.

142
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,480
This in itself is undoubtedly a great crime.

143
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,720
But the prosecution is not
calling the defendants to account

144
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,400
for violating constitutional guaranties
or withholding due process of law.

145
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,840
The prosecution is calling them
to account for murder,

146
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,640
brutalities,

147
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,080
torture,

148
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,600
atrocities!

149
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,080
They share, with all the leaders
of the Third Reich,

150
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,640
responsibility for the most malignant,
the most calculated,

151
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,880
the most devastating crimes
in the history of all mankind.

152
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,680
They are perhaps more guilty
than some of the others,

153
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,960
for they had attained maturity
long before Hitler's rise to power.

154
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,840
Their minds weren't warped
at an early age by Nazi teachings.

155
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,160
They embraced the ideologies
of the Third Reich as educated adults,

156
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,840
when they, most of all,
should have valued justice.

157
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,560
Here they'll receive the justice
they denied others.

158
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,800
They'll be judged according to
the evidence presented in this courtroom.

159
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,280
The prosecution asks nothing more.

160
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,880
Herr Rolfe will make the opening
statement for the defence.

161
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,680
<i>(speaks German)</i>

162
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,400
<i>(interpreter) May it please the tribunal.</i>

163
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,320
<i>(speaks German)</i>

164
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,600
<i>(interpreter)
It is not only a great honour...</i>

165
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
but also a great challenge...

166
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,800
for an advocate...

167
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,120
to aid this tribunal in its task.

168
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,520
The entire civilised world

169
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,600
will follow closely what we do here.

170
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,640
For this is not an ordinary trial,

171
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,520
by any means of
the accepted parochial sense.

172
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,960
The avowed purpose of this tribunal

173
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,520
<i>(in English) is broader than
the visiting of retribution on a few men.</i>

174
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,720
It is dedicated to the reconsecration
of the temple of justice.

175
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,920
It is dedicated to finding a code of justice
the whole world will be responsible to.

176
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,120
How will this code be established?

177
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,480
It will be established

178
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:36,240
in a clear, honest evaluation
of the responsibility for the crimes

179
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,040
in the indictment
stated by the prosecution.

180
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,360
In the words of the great American
jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes,

181
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,520
"This responsibility
will not be found only in documents

182
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,520
that no one contests or denies."

183
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,600
"It will be found in considerations
of a political or social nature."

184
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:03,400
"It will be found, most of all,
in the character of men."

185
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,920
What is the character of Ernst Janning?

186
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,480
Let us examine his life for a moment.

187
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,800
He was born in 1885.

188
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,600
Received the degree
of Doctor of Law in 1907.

189
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,360
Became a judge in East Prussia in 1914.

190
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,880
Following World War I, he became
one of the Weimar Republic leaders

191
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,760
and one of the framers
of its democratic constitution.

192
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,480
In subsequent years,
he achieved international fame

193
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,600
not only for his work as a great jurist,
but also as the author of legal textbooks

194
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,520
which are still used
in universities all over the world.

195
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,680
He became Minister of Justice
in Germany in 1935.

196
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,480
If Ernst Janning is to be found guilty,

197
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,800
certain implications must arise.

198
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,640
A judge does not make the laws.

199
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,520
He carries out the laws of his country.

200
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,200
The statement
"My country, right or wrong"

201
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,800
was expressed
by a great American patriot.

202
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,360
It is no less true for a German patriot.

203
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,240
Should Ernst Janning have carried out
the laws of his country?

204
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,640
Or should he have refused
to carry them out and become a traitor?

205
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,320
This is the crux of the issue
at the bottom of this trial.

206
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,480
The defence is as dedicated
to finding responsibility

207
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,560
as is the prosecution.

208
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,320
For it is not only Ernst Janning
who is on trial here.

209
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,720
It is the German people.

210
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,040
The tribunal will recess
until further notification.

211
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,240
Yeah.

212
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,480
If it's all right with you,
Byers can file these briefs later.

213
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,960
It was quite a damning speech
by Colonel Lawson, wasn't it?

214
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,000
I wonder if those men
in the dock can really be responsible

215
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,360
for the things he listed in the indictment.

216
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,800
I've been here two years,
and after that long

217
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,040
you find that responsibility
is not a cut-and-dried thing.

218
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,200
What are you fellows up to this weekend?

219
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,560
My wife and I are going to Liège.

220
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,880
There's nothing in Liège.
I've been there.

221
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,880
My son was in the 101st.

222
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,280
He's buried in the American
cemetery outside Liège.

223
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,960
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

224
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,800
- See you Monday, Dan.
- Mm.

225
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,040
- Coming my way?
- No, I'm staying here for a moment.

226
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,400
I'm waiting for some records from Byers.

227
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,480
Right.

228
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,280
- Here are the reports you asked for, sir.
- Thank you.

229
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,720
Captain, do you think you could get me
a copy of the books Ernst Janning wrote?

230
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,840
- There are quite a few of them.
- I'd like all of them.

231
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,600
And also a copy of the Weimar
constitution. Can you get that for me?

232
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,520
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

233
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,760
- How long have you been here, Captain?
- Two years.

234
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,600
- Two years, that's a long time.
- Yes, sir.

235
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,720
- Any friends?
- Sure.

236
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,240
- German friends?
- Yes.

237
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
- A girl?
- Yes.

238
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,360
Her parents were Nazis,
but she was eight when they came in.

239
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,120
- I didn't ask you that.
- Maybe you were thinking it.

240
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,520
It's natural to think about it.

241
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,160
I thought if anybody was going to
indoctrinate her, it might as well be me.

242
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,920
- Will there be anything else?
- No. I think I'll take a walk around town.

243
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,480
Try the old section
for a beer and a sausage.

244
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,560
Thank you.

245
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,400
<i>Nicht mehr! Nicht mehr!</i>

246
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,680
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, Opa.</i>

247
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,560
- Do you understand English?
- Yes, a little.

248
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,720
- What did she say?
- She said "Goodbye, Grandpa."

249
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,320
<i>("Wenn wir marschieren")</i>

250
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,200
<i>(Hitler) Vor uns liegt Deutschland,</i>

251
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,520
<i>in uns marschiert Deutschland,</i>

252
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,680
<i>und hinter uns kommt Deutschland.</i>

253
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,760
<i>(cheering)</i>

254
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,440
<i>(marching band)</i>

255
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,840
- Are they treating you all right?
- Yes. They are treating me all right.

256
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,320
We still have some friends who have
contact with the American authorities.

257
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,840
- I can tell them if they are not.
- They're treating me all right.

258
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,520
Doctor Janning...

259
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,680
we are both in an embarrassing position.

260
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,960
I know you didn't want me
as your counsel.

261
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,320
I know you didn't want anyone.

262
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,400
But I must tell you something.
Will you listen to me?

263
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,800
Yes.

264
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,560
I intend to represent your case
with complete dignity.

265
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,320
There will be no appeal to sentiment,

266
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,800
there will be no falling
at the mercy of the court.

267
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:16,600
The game will be played
according to their own rules.

268
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:24,520
We'll see whether they have the courage
to sit in judgment on a man like you.

269
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,680
The way I see it,

270
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:34,320
the most important elements in the case
are the sterilisation decrees

271
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,800
and the Feldenstein-Hoffman affair.

272
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,800
Doctor Janning,

273
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,080
I must tell you something.

274
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,320
I admired you
since I was a boy in the university.

275
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,880
It was because I thought
I might be able to achieve

276
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,800
some of the things you have done

277
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:07,560
that saw me through the war.

278
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,080
You have been somebody
to look up to for all of us.

279
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,520
Is that all, Herr Rolfe?

280
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,840
- Yes.
- Thank you.

281
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,400
Dr Wieck, do you know
the defendant Ernst Janning?

282
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,600
Yes, I know him.

283
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,160
Will you tell us in what capacity?

284
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:51,520
We served in the Ministry of Justice
together from 1929 till 1935.

285
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,080
- Did you know him before that?
- Yes. He was a law student of mine.

286
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,880
- Did you know him well?
- Yes.

287
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,760
- Was he a protégé of yours?
- Yes.

288
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,080
Why?

289
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,040
He was always a man
of great intelligence.

290
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,800
He was a man born with
the qualities of a great legal mind.

291
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,840
Dr Wieck, would you, uh...

292
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,000
would you tell us,
from your own experience,

293
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:25,200
the position of the judge in Germany
prior to the advent of Adolf Hitler?

294
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,720
The position of the judge
was one of complete independence.

295
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,240
Mm-hm.

296
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,160
Now would you describe
the contrast, if any,

297
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,000
after the coming to power
of National Socialism in 1933?

298
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:44,320
Judges became subject to something
outside of objective justice.

299
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:49,800
They were subject to what was necessary
for the protection of the country.

300
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,680
- Would you explain this, please?
- The first consideration of the judge

301
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,120
became the punishment
of acts against the state,

302
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,800
rather than objective consideration
of the case.

303
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,320
And what other changes were there?

304
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,040
The right to appeal was eliminated.

305
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:13,400
The Supreme Court of the Reich was
replaced by peoples' and special courts.

306
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,240
The concept of race was made
a legal concept for the first time.

307
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,240
And what was the result of this?

308
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,360
The result?

309
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,280
The result was to hand over
the administration of justice

310
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,120
into the hands of the dictatorship.

311
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,080
- Dr Wieck...
- Colonel Lawson,

312
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,000
I'd like to ask a few questions.

313
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,480
Did the judiciary protest these laws
abridging their independence?

314
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,960
A few of them did. Those who did
resigned or were forced to resign.

315
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,680
Others...

316
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,880
adapted themselves to the new situation.

317
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:00,000
Do you think the judiciary
was aware of the consequences to come?

318
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,160
At first, perhaps not.

319
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:07,720
Later it became clear
to anyone who had eyes and ears.

320
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,160
Thank you.

321
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,880
Now, would you please describe for us
the changes in criminal law.

322
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:21,560
Its characteristic was an ever-increasing
inflation of the death penalty.

323
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,400
Sentences were passed
against defendants

324
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:30,360
just because they were Poles or Jews,
or politically undesirable.

325
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,240
Novel National Socialist
measures were introduced,

326
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,960
among them sexual sterilisation for
those who were categorised as asocial.

327
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,720
Was it necessary for judges to wear any
distinctive mark on their robes in 1935?

328
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,600
The so-called "Führer's decree"

329
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,640
required judges to wear the insignia
of the swastika on their robes.

330
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,200
- Did you wear such an insignia?
- No.

331
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,280
I would have been ashamed to wear it.

332
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,760
- Did you resign in 1935?
- Yes, sir.

333
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,640
Did Ernst Janning wear
a swastika on his robe?

334
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,960
Yes.

335
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,720
That's all. Thank you.

336
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,600
Herr Rolfe.

337
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,080
Herr Justizrat Dr Wieck.

338
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:38,160
You used the phrase "necessary
for the protection of the country."

339
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,720
Would you explain
the conditions in Germany

340
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,000
at the time National Socialism
came to power?

341
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,080
What conditions?

342
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,040
Would you say
there was widespread hunger?

343
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,160
Yes.

344
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,800
Would you say
there was internal disunity?

345
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,120
Yes.

346
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,040
- Was there a Communist Party?
- Yes.

347
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,280
Was it the third largest party in Germany?

348
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,240
Mm... yes.

349
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:09,800
Would you say that National Socialism
helped to cure some of these conditions?

350
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,200
Yes, but at a terrible price, and...

351
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,000
Please, confine yourself
to answering the questions only.

352
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,440
Therefore, was it not possible
that a judge might wear a swastika

353
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,480
and yet work for what he thought
was best for his country?

354
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,360
No. It was not possible.

355
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,760
Dr Wieck,

356
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:41,240
you were not in the administration
from the years 1935 to 1943,

357
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,960
by your own admission.

358
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:51,040
Is it not possible that your view
of the administration might be distorted?

359
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,080
No, it is not.

360
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:59,640
How can you testify about events in
the administration if you were not there?

361
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,600
I had many friends
in the legal administration.

362
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,480
There were journals and books.

363
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,240
From journals and books?

364
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,840
I see.

365
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,760
Dr Wieck, you referred to "novel
National Socialist measures introduced,

366
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,960
among them sexual sterilisation."

367
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,160
Are you aware that sexual sterilisation
was not invented by National Socialism,

368
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,080
but had been advanced
for years before as a weapon

369
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,400
in dealing with the mentally
incompetent and the criminal?

370
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,120
Yes, I am aware of that.

371
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,960
Are you aware it has advocates among
leading citizens in many countries?

372
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,840
I am not an expert on such laws.

373
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,560
Then permit me to read one to you.

374
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,040
This is a High Court opinion

375
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,600
upholding such laws
in existence in another country.

376
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,040
And I quote:

377
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,160
"We have seen more than once
that the public welfare

378
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,880
may call upon
their best citizens for their lives."

379
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,760
"It would be strange indeed
if it could not call upon

380
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,120
those who already sap the strength
of the state for these lesser sacrifices

381
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,520
in order to prevent
our being swamped by incompetence."

382
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,600
"It is better if, instead of waiting to
execute degenerate offspring for crime

383
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,880
or to let them starve
for their imbecility,

384
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,240
society can prevent their propagation
by medical means in the first place."

385
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,160
"Three generations
of imbeciles are enough."

386
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,840
- Do you recognise it now, Dr Wieck?
- No, sir, I don't.

387
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,320
Actually, there is
no particular reason you should,

388
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,200
since the opinion upholds the sterilisation
law in the state of Virginia,

389
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,440
of the United States,

390
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,160
and was written
by that great American jurist

391
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,720
Supreme Court Justice
Oliver Wendell Holmes.

392
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,720
Now, Dr Wieck,

393
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,880
in view of what you have just learned,

394
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,800
can you still say that sexual sterilisation
was a "novel National Socialist measure"?

395
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,880
Yes, I can say it,

396
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,160
because it was never before used
as a weapon against political opponents.

397
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,240
Do you personally know of a case

398
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,760
where someone was sterilised
for political reasons?

399
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,920
- I know that such things were done.
- That's not the question.

400
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,840
Please answer the question.
Do you know of a case?

401
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,600
I don't know of any specific case
or specific date.

402
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,520
I am asking if you have any first-hand,
personal knowledge of such a case!

403
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,760
No, I have no such personal knowledge.

404
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,840
Thank you.

405
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,440
Dr Wieck,

406
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,560
you are aware of the charges
in the indictment against Ernst Janning?

407
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,240
Yes, I am.

408
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,000
Can you honestly say
he is responsible for them?

409
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,120
Yes, I can.

410
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,400
Do you consider yourself
free of responsibility?

411
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,000
Yes, I do.

412
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:51,960
Dr Wieck, did you ever swear to
the Civil Servant Loyalty Oath of 1934?

413
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,480
Your Honour, I object.

414
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,440
The witness doesn't have to answer
that question. He's not on trial.

415
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,320
All Germany is on trial. This tribunal put
it on trial when it indicted Ernst Janning.

416
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,400
If responsibility is to be found,
the widest latitude is to be permitted.

417
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,280
Objection overruled.

418
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,640
Did you ever swear to
the Civil Servant Loyalty Oath of 1934?

419
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,400
- Everyone did.
- We are not interested in everyone.

420
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,960
We are interested in what you did.

421
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:30,240
Would you read the oath from
the Reich Law Gazette, March 1933.

422
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,560
"I swear that I shall obey the leader of the
German Reich and people, Adolf Hitler,

423
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,720
that I shall be loyal to him,
that I will observe the laws

424
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,480
and that I will conscientiously
fulfil my duties, so help me God."

425
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,560
Everyone swore to it.

426
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,040
It was mandatory.

427
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,640
Yes.

428
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,600
But you're such a perceptive man, Dr
Wieck. You could see what was coming.

429
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,280
You could see that National Socialism
was leading Germany to disaster.

430
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,200
"It was clear to anyone
who had eyes and ears."

431
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,960
Didn't you realise
what it would have meant

432
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:16,720
if you, and men like you,
would have refused to swear to the oath?

433
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:22,800
It would have meant that Hitler could
never have come to absolute power!

434
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,480
Why didn't you?
Dr Wieck, why didn't you?

435
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,880
Can you give us an explanation?

436
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,080
Has it something to do with your pension?

437
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,520
Did it mean more to you
than your country?

438
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,200
Your Honour, I object to
the entire line of questioning

439
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,560
and ask that it be stricken
from the record.

440
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,560
Prosecuting counsel's job
is to find responsibility.

441
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,720
Your Honour, I made an objection.

442
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,440
Prosecution does not want
to find responsibility?

443
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:56,000
There is responsibility for more here
than swearing to a loyalty oath!

444
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,080
There is indeed!

445
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,400
- Order.
- One thing even the German machine,

446
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,880
with its monumental efficiency,
has been unable to destroy!

447
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,280
- Order!
- All the victims!

448
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,640
More victims than the world has
ever known. They will walk in here...

449
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,240
Order! Order!

450
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,560
This tribunal will admonish both
counsels. It will not tolerate this again.

451
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,000
We're not here to listen to such outbursts,
but to serve justice.

452
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,800
- Your Honour, I made an objection.
- The objection is overruled.

453
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,440
The witness is excused.

454
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,760
- Ever read any books by Janning?
- No, I don't think so.

455
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,640
<i>- The Meaning of the Law.
- How is it? Interesting?</i>

456
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,720
All the books by Janning are interesting.

457
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,400
They're a picture of an era,
its hopes, aspirations.

458
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,800
They weren't very different from ours.

459
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,360
Listen to this, on the signing
of the Weimar constitution.

460
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,200
"Now we can look forward to a Germany
without guns and bloodshed."

461
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:24,080
"A Germany of justice,
where men can live instead of die."

462
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,120
"A Germany of purpose,
of freedom, of humanity."

463
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,400
"A Germany that calls
for the best in man."

464
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,560
How could a man who wrote
words like these

465
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,280
be part of sterilisations and murders?
How could he be?

466
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,120
Dan, there are a lot of things that
happened here that nobody understands.

467
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,240
I know.

468
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,120
But the prosecution is going to have
to prove every inch of its allegation

469
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,080
against a man like Janning
if I'm to pronounce sentence on him.

470
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,040
Gentlemen, I'm on my way.

471
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,120
- Coming, Ken?
- Right.

472
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,640
There's just this business
on the curtailment of rights.

473
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,040
Tomorrow.

474
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,560
Dan, my wife is planning a get-together
tomorrow at the Grand Hotel.

475
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,000
- She wants you to come.
- All right. Thank you.

476
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,240
And she'd like to provide you
with some kind of female companionship.

477
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,400
She thought you might be Ionely here.

478
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,800
No, thanks, Curtiss.
Thanks very much.

479
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,160
You know how these wives
love to play Cupid.

480
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,560
- I think I'll keep it stag.
- All right.

481
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,480
- How about you, Ken?
- Thanks. My wife and I are busy.

482
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,440
- Good night.
- Good night, Dan.

483
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,120
Mrs Halbestadt, could I...

484
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,680
Hello.

485
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,640
Hello.

486
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,720
Your Honour, this is Madame Bertholt.

487
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,840
This is His Honour, Judge Haywood.

488
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,880
Madame Bertholt, this is her house.

489
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,840
She came to get some of her
belongings from the basement.

490
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:10,160
- I didn't know she was coming tonight.
- It's my responsibility, Mrs Halbestadt.

491
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,160
I've stored some of my things here until
I could get a room large enough for them.

492
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,840
- I hope you don't mind.
- No. Not at all.

493
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,120
You can examine
what I have here if you like.

494
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,040
- Of course not.
- Then I'll just take these out.

495
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,440
- Thank you, Mrs Halbestadt.
- Let me help you.

496
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,760
- I can manage.
- I'll just take it outside. Please.

497
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,840
Good night.

498
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,360
It's heavy. It's full of books and pictures
that mean nothing to anyone but me.

499
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,720
- Mr Schmidt!
- Your Honour.

500
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,880
- Would you drive Mrs Bertholt home?
- Yes, Your Honour.

501
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,560
- I hope you're comfortable here.
- Yes, I am. Very.

502
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,080
My favourite spot was always the garden.

503
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,160
Remind Mr Halbestadt
to take good care of the rock garden.

504
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,240
You'll get a great deal of pleasure
out of it in summer.

505
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,720
I'll sit in front, thank you.

506
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,240
- Good night.
- Good night.

507
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,520
- Karolinenstrasse 115.
- Yes, madam.

508
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,480
<i>(whispered conversation)</i>

509
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,680
Sit down, sit down.

510
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,120
Mrs Halbestadt, you worked
for Mrs Bertholt, didn't you?

511
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,440
- Yes, Your Honour.
- How long did she live here?

512
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,800
Madame Bertholt?

513
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,480
Oh, Madame Bertholt and her family
have lived here for many generations.

514
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,640
Thank you.

515
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,680
Your Honour,
you came in here for something?

516
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,080
Oh! Oh, yeah.

517
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,280
I'm just going to make myself a sandwich.

518
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,120
We will make it.
We will make you anything you want.

519
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,920
No, it's nothing.
I always did it for myself back home.

520
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:16,720
What would you like? I have some ham
and cheese and liverwurst.

521
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,800
Cheese will be fine.

522
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,360
That's very kind of you.

523
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,320
Mr Halbestadt, what was it like,
living under National Socialism?

524
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:41,240
- What was it like?
- Yes. I mean, uh... day-to-day?

525
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,000
I know many people at home like you.

526
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,080
You're good people. I believe that.

527
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,920
What was it like for you,
living under Hitler?

528
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,800
We were not political.
Mr Halbestadt and I are not political.

529
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,120
<i>- Ein Glas fur die Milch, bitte.
- Ja.</i>

530
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:03,360
No, but you must have been aware
of some of the events that were going on.

531
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,520
Many things were going on,
Mr Halbestadt.

532
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,960
There were parades.

533
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,440
Hitler and Goebbels
came here every year.

534
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,000
What was it like?

535
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,480
We never attended meetings. Never.

536
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,440
I'm not trying to put you on trial.
I'm just, uh...

537
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,120
I'm just curious. I'd like to know.

538
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,320
- Here's your sandwich, Your Honour.
- Thank you.

539
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,400
You're welcome.

540
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,480
Thank you.

541
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,960
For instance, there was a place called
Dachau not too many miles from here.

542
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,560
Did you ever know
what was going on there?

543
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,120
We knew nothing about it.
Nothing about it.

544
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:55,640
How can you ask
if we know anything about that?

545
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,120
I'm sorry.

546
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,720
Your Honour, we are only little people.

547
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,640
We lost a son in the army

548
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,640
and our daughter in the bombing.

549
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,560
During the war we almost starved.

550
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,760
It was terrible for us.

551
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,040
I'm sure it was.

552
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:27,760
Hitler...
Hitler did some good things.

553
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,040
I won't say he didn't do some good things.

554
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,640
He built the autobahn.
He gave more people work.

555
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,800
We won't say
he didn't do some good things.

556
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,240
But the other things...

557
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:49,920
The things they say he did to the Jews
and the rest, we knew nothing about that.

558
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,000
Very few Germans did.

559
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,840
And if we did know...

560
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,040
what could we do?

561
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,560
But Mrs Halbestadt said you didn't know.

562
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,520
Mrs Bertholt,
how did she react to all this?

563
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,560
Ah, Madame Bertholt
is a very fine woman, Your Honour.

564
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,840
I'm sure she is.
What about her husband?

565
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,880
He was in the army.

566
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,960
What happened to him?

567
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,240
He was one of the defendants
in the Malmedy case.

568
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,200
General Bertholt. Karl Bertholt.

569
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,200
He was executed, Your Honour.

570
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,880
Yes, I know that.

571
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,600
The document then states
that the photographer Rudolf Lenz

572
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,160
is requested to present himself
within two weeks

573
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:59,640
at one of the hospitals mentioned below
for "medical treatment".

574
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,800
Next, prosecution presents
affidavit document no.488,

575
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,760
which concerns
the seamstress Anni Münch.

576
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,920
Document reads as follows:

577
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,240
"District court Frankfurt am Main
has decided the following:

578
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:16,280
The seamstress Anni Münch, daughter
of Wilhelm Münch, is to be sterilised."

579
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,200
"She is requested
to present herself within two weeks

580
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,720
at one of the hospitals mentioned below."

581
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:27,200
"If she does not take herself voluntarily,
she will be taken by force."

582
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:32,640
Next, document no.449, interrogatories
in the German and English text,

583
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,360
concerning the farmer's helper
Meyer Eichinger.

584
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,440
- Your Honour.
- What?

585
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,080
Defence objects to introduction
of these repetitive documents.

586
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,960
According to the ruling
of the first tribunal,

587
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,120
such documents are not even admissible

588
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:54,200
unless supported by independent
evidence of their authenticity.

589
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,920
Objection sustained.

590
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,440
Your Honour,
may I ask the defence a question?

591
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,880
Yes.

592
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,960
Would evidence on sterilisation
be admissible if there were a witness?

593
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,120
- Yes.
- Thank you.

594
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,800
Prosecution calls the witness
Rudolf Petersen.

595
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,080
Will you raise your right hand?

596
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,000
I swear by God the Almighty
and Omniscient

597
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,640
that I will speak the pure truth
and withhold and add nothing.

598
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,720
Yes, I do.

599
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,240
Will you please tell the court
your full name and place of residence.

600
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:21,600
<i>Rudolf Petersen. Frankfurt am Main.
Gretweg, Nummer sieben.</i>

601
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,200
When were you born, Mr Petersen?

602
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,840
May 20, 1914.

603
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,840
And what is your occupation?

604
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,360
Baker's helper. I'm a baker's helper.

605
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,120
Are your parents living?

606
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,920
No.

607
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:42,120
What were the causes of their deaths?

608
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,160
Mr Petersen,
did they die of natural causes?

609
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,440
<i>Ja, ja. Ja. Natural.</i>

610
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:58,240
Now, Mr Petersen, what political party
did your father belong to?

611
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,720
Communist. The Communist Party.

612
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,600
Uh-huh.

613
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,040
Now, think back.

614
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:13,480
Do you remember anything unusual that
happened to you and your family in 1933,

615
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,440
before the Nazis came to power?

616
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,080
I mean anything of a violent nature.

617
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,400
<i>Ja, ja.</i>

618
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:25,360
- How old were you at the time?
- 19.

619
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,280
Would you please
tell the court what happened?

620
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,160
Uh... some...

621
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,840
Some SA men broke into
the house, our house,

622
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,640
and they broke the windows and the door.

623
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,800
They called us traitors

624
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,560
and they tried to... to beat up my father.

625
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,400
And what happened then?

626
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,560
My brothers and I, we went to help him.

627
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,200
And there was a fight.

628
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:04,000
Finally we got them outside in the street

629
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,360
and we beat them up,

630
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,640
and turned them over to the police.

631
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:13,120
- Did the police do anything about it?
- No.

632
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,560
Why not?

633
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:20,600
It was then at the time
of the national elections.

634
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,360
<i>- The National Socialists came to power?
- Ja.</i>

635
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,440
Now, Mr Petersen,

636
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:32,880
what happened after 1933,
after the Nazis came to power?

637
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,880
I got a job on a farm,

638
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,200
but for the work,
to drive a truck it was necessary.

639
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:46,360
I went to the city building
to apply for a licence.

640
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,960
And what happened there?

641
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,960
They took me to an official.

642
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,880
Did you ever have any dealings
with this official before?

643
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,520
He was one of the men
who broke into our house that night.

644
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,960
What did he say to your application?

645
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:12,440
He said an examination
there would have to be.

646
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,800
Where was the examination to take place?

647
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,280
In the district court of Stuttgart.

648
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,960
Who was the presiding justice
in the court?

649
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,160
Justice Hofstetter.

650
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,800
Now, what happened in the courtroom?

651
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:38,400
They asked me my full name
and so forth.

652
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,440
What else did they ask you?

653
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:47,480
They asked me when Adolf Hitler
and Dr Goebbels were born.

654
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,120
What did you reply?

655
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:55,320
I told them I didn't know,
and also that I didn't care.

656
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,400
<i>(laughter)</i>

657
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,160
Did they ask you any more questions?

658
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:09,040
No. They told me that I would be
hearing from them in ten days.

659
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,400
I see.

660
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,680
Mr Petersen,

661
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,240
I'd like you to look at something.

662
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,040
<i>- Do you recognise it?
- Ja.</i>

663
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,600
Would you please read it for the tribunal?

664
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:41,040
"District court of Stuttgart."

665
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:45,400
"The baker Rudolf Petersen,
born May 20th 1914,

666
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,480
son of railway employee Hans Petersen,

667
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:55,280
is to be sterilised."

668
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,720
<i>(Lawson) Would you read
the last paragraph?</i>

669
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:09,600
"It is therefore requested
he present himself within two weeks

670
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,160
to one of the hospitals mentioned below."

671
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:21,040
"If he does not betake himself voluntarily,

672
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,680
he will be taken by force."

673
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,320
Now please read the signature
at the bottom.

674
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,320
"Presiding Justice Hofstetter."

675
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,280
Would you read what is written

<i>- Below?
- (Lawson) Below.</i>

677
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:53,320
"By authority of Ernst Janning,

678
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,720
Minister of Justice."

679
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,800
Your Honour,

680
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,600
may the defence
see the file of Mr Petersen?

681
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,920
What did you do after
you received the letter, Mr Petersen?

682
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:16,640
I ran away.
I stayed at the farm of a friend I have.

683
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,080
And did you return?

684
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,200
- Did I what?
- Did you return?

685
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,120
Yes.

686
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,200
And what happened then?

687
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:31,040
The police came. The police came.

688
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:36,840
<i>- Where did they take you?
- (quietly) To the hospital.</i>

689
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,560
Mr Petersen. Excuse me, I wonder
if you could speak a little louder, please.

690
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,840
To the hospital.

691
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,760
- What happened at the hospital?
- They kept me there.

692
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,120
The nurse who was...

693
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,920
Well, she came in anyway.

694
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:01,040
She was to prepare me for the operation.

695
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:05,600
And she said she thought
the whole thing was terrible.

696
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:12,680
And then the doctor came in,
who was supposed to do the...

697
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,120
and he said he thought it was awful.

698
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:23,120
Were you in fact sterilised?

699
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,920
<i>(Lawson)
Thank you very much, Mr Petersen.</i>

700
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,520
That's all.

701
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,680
Herr Rolfe.

702
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,080
Mr Petersen,

703
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,680
you may take your earphones off now,
if you want to.

704
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:08,680
Mr Petersen, you say you work
as a baker's helper? Is that correct?

705
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,760
Yes, that is right.

706
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,640
What other occupations have you held?

707
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,200
I have worked for my father.

708
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:22,520
- What did your father do?
- He was a railroad worker.

709
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,520
Yes, but what did he do?

710
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:34,240
He would raise and lower the barrier
at the crossing for traffic.

711
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,560
And you spoke about your brothers.

712
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:44,440
- How many brothers do you have?
- Five.

713
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,160
- And sisters?
- Four.

714
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,240
- Then you are a family of ten?
- Yes.

715
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,280
What occupations do your brothers have?

716
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,680
Labourers.

717
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,760
All labourers?

718
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,960
I see.

719
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:06,840
Mr Petersen, you said the court
at Stuttgart asked you two questions,

720
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,000
the birth dates of Hitler and Dr Goebbels.

721
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:12,320
- Is that correct?
- Yes. Correct.

722
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,480
What else did they ask you?

723
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,720
Uh...

724
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:19,400
Nothing else.

725
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,480
Are you sure?

726
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,760
Are you sure there were
no questions about your schooling?

727
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,840
<i>(Lawson) Objection!</i>

728
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,720
The witness has already
answered that question.

729
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,400
Objection sustained.

730
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,040
May I ask you, Mr Petersen...

731
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,600
may I ask you...

732
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,760
how long did you attend school?

733
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:59,000
- Six years.
- Six years. Why not longer?

734
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,240
I had to go to work.

735
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:07,320
Would you consider yourself
a very bright fellow at school?

736
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,640
School? It was...

737
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:14,160
It was a long while ago. I don't...

738
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,280
Perhaps you were not able
to keep up with the others

739
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,360
and that's why you did not continue?

740
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,520
Objection, Your Honour.

741
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:24,960
The witness' school record has
no bearing on what happened to him.

742
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:30,480
It was the task of the health court
to sterilise the mentally incompetent.

743
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,360
Objection overruled.

744
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:47,120
Were you able or were you not able
to keep up with the others?

745
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:57,080
I would like to refer to the efficiency
report from the school about Mr Petersen.

746
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:03,040
He failed to be promoted and was placed
in a class of backward children.

747
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:09,840
You say your parents
died of natural causes.

748
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,200
Yes.

749
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,680
Would you describe in detail
the illness your mother died of?

750
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,760
She died of her heart.

751
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:21,960
In the last stages of her illness,
did your mother show any...

752
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,880
mental peculiarities?

753
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,120
Mental... No. No.

754
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,840
In the decision that came from Stuttgart,

755
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,480
it is stated that your mother suffered
from hereditary feeble-mindedness.

756
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,040
That is not... That is not true.

757
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,000
Not true, not true.

758
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,080
Can you give us
some clarification as to how

759
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:48,000
the Hereditary Health Court in Stuttgart
arrived at that decision?

760
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:52,800
It was just something they said
to put me on the operating table.

761
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,480
- It was just something they said?
- Yes!

762
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:02,680
Mr Petersen, there was a simple test
that the Health Court used to ask

763
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,640
in all cases of mental incompetence.

764
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,760
Since you say they did not ask you then,

765
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,400
perhaps you can answer it for us now?

766
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:15,040
Form a sentence out of the words
"hare", "hunter", "field".

767
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,240
Your Honour! Objection!

768
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,040
Mr Petersen,

769
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:30,000
was the court in Stuttgart
constituted like this one?

770
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,560
I don't understand what...

771
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,120
Was there an audience?

772
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,560
An audience? Yes, yes.

773
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,400
Thank you.

774
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,760
Objection overruled.

775
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:52,960
Hare, hunter, field, Mr Petersen.

776
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,600
Take your time.

777
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,680
Hare, hunter, field. Uh...

778
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,720
Hare,

779
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,800
hunter...

780
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,680
They had already made up...

781
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,680
When I walked into the court,
they had made up their minds.

782
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,760
They had made up their minds!

783
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,160
They put me in the hospital,
like a criminal.

784
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:28,720
I could not say anything,
I could not do anything. I...

785
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,200
I had to lie there.

786
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,280
My... my mother...

787
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,320
what you say about her.

788
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:44,080
She was a woman,
a servant woman, who worked hard.

789
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,160
She was a hardworking woman.

790
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:49,920
And it is not fair - not fair - what you say.

791
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,560
I have it here.

792
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:02,640
I want to show you.
I have here her picture.

793
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,000
I would like you looked at it.

794
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,480
I would like you to judge.

795
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,840
I want that you tell me,

796
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,400
was she feeble-minded?

797
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,320
My mother!

798
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,520
Was she feeble-minded?

799
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,680
Was she?

800
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:52,160
I feel it is my duty
to point out to the tribunal

801
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,280
that the witness is not
in control of his mental processes.

802
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,440
I know I'm not.

803
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,520
Since that day,

804
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:05,280
I've been half I've ever been.

805
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:16,400
The tribunal does not know
how you were before.

806
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:21,000
It can never know.
It has only your word.

807
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,120
Court is adjourned.

808
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,960
<i>(dance band)</i>

809
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,160
That's one problem we have
with the prosecution -

810
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:01,280
it's filled with young radicals like Lawson.

811
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,680
Is that what Lawson is? A young radical?

812
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,720
Well, he was a personal protégé of FDR.

813
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,840
FDR had a few friends
who weren't radicals, didn't he?

814
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,320
Name one.

815
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,080
- Wendell Wilkie.
- Wilkie.

816
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,120
Is he your idea of a conservative?

817
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:22,160
As a matter of fact, Dan,
I've been wondering how you stand?

818
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:26,520
I'll clarify that for you, Curtiss.
I'm a rock-ribbed Republican

819
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,840
who thought that
Franklin Roosevelt was a great man.

820
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,360
Oh. One of those.

821
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,960
Max!

822
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,720
- Max Perkins. Do you know him?
- I don't think so.

823
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,080
He's with the United Press.

824
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:49,480
- Max, what are you doing here?
- I thought you might kick up a row.

825
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,760
I haven't had that much to drink.

826
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,080
- Oh, I'm sorry. This is Judge Ives.
- Hello.

827
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,880
- Mrs Ives.
- How do you do?

828
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,240
- How do you do?
- Judge Haywood, Mrs Bertholt.

829
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,600
- We have met.
- Yes, we have.

830
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:04,520
- Won't you join us for a drink?
- We would like to very much.

831
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,240
- Max, will you sit here?
- Thank you.

832
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,520
Incidentally, Max, I admired your article
on Mrs Bertholt very much.

833
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:15,400
It was straight reporting. Her defence
of her husband was quite eloquent.

834
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,800
Are you going to do a story
on these trials?

835
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,320
I'll tell you something frankly, Judge.

836
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:23,960
<i>At the moment I couldn't give a story
away on the Nuremberg trials.</i>

837
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,960
- What do you mean, Mr Perkins?
- The American public isn't interested.

838
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:31,120
The war's only been over two years,
Mr Perkins.

839
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,840
That's right.

840
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,880
- May I take your order?
- Yes. See what the ladies will have.

841
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,200
- How about some more beer, Dan?
- No, I think I've had my fill of beer.

842
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:41,320
I'd like to try something else, if I may.

843
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,600
Why don't you try some Sonnenberg
or Schwalbenwinkel? It's the local wine.

844
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,440
- Sonnenberg or...?
- Schwalbenwinkel.

845
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,480
Yes, I think I'd like that.
Some Schwalbenwinkel.

846
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,960
- Will you have some?
- Yes, thank you.

847
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,600
- Shall we stay with the beer, Max?
- Fine.

848
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,440
Thank you.

849
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:02,720
- You got home all right the other night?
- Yes, thank you.

850
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:06,480
I don't know what I would
have done without the car.

851
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:09,200
You speak English very well, Mrs Bertholt.

852
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,520
Thank you.

853
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,200
My husband and I
spent two years in America.

854
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:20,320
I hope you've had a chance
to see something of Nuremberg.

855
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:25,840
I'm afraid mainly the road between
my house and the Palace of Justice.

856
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:30,200
And then some places that have to do
with the case, historical aspects.

857
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:34,720
The Nazi aspects. You should see
some of the other parts of Nuremberg.

858
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:38,000
There are many beautiful things
to see in the old part of town,

859
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,080
museums we're trying to rebuild.

860
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:44,280
And there's a concert, a piano concert,
next week at the old opera house.

861
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:48,480
Arthur Reiss. He was a refugee
from Hitler in the early days.

862
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,360
We've persuaded him to come back.
It ought to be quite an evening.

863
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:56,560
- Would you like to come?
- Yes, I would.

864
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:00,600
I'll have them leave a ticket for you
at the box office. I'm on the committee.

865
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,320
- Thank you very much, Mrs Bertholt.
- It's nothing.

866
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:07,160
I have a mission with the Americans,
as Mr Perkins can tell you.

867
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,520
Oh? What is that?

868
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:13,520
To convince you
that we're not all monsters.

869
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:20,120
- Good evening, Colonel.
- Colonel, Major Radnitz.

870
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,600
Good evening, Mrs Bertholt.

871
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,640
- I hope you'll excuse me.
- You've just come.

872
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,720
No, I must go. Please excuse me.

873
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,800
It was awfully nice meeting you.

874
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,840
There will be a concert ticket
for you at the box office.

875
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:35,960
Thank you.

876
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,720
- Good night.
- Good night.

877
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,960
- Good night.
- Good night, Mrs Bertholt.

878
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,160
Huh.

879
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:49,680
Mrs Bertholt doesn't hold
a burning passion for me.

880
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:53,240
I prosecuted her husband.

881
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,400
Many people think a death sentence
would not have been passed

882
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,400
against General Bertholt today.

883
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,960
I'm sure they do.

884
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,200
I'm sure there are people who think

885
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,400
all the prisoners in Nuremberg
should be free today.

886
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,480
All of them! Let's...

887
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,120
Excuse me.

888
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,200
I've had, uh...

889
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:19,520
I've had one or two too many, as might
be painfully obvious to you gentlemen.

890
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:23,840
The spectacle this afternoon with
Mr Petersen put me off my feed. I'm sorry.

891
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:27,960
Three beers and Schwalbenwinkel,
please.

892
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:34,160
<i>Prosit. Prosit.</i>

893
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:37,800
- Schwalbenwinkel.
- Schwalbenwinkel.

894
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,160
Yes, it's good beer.
They make it good in this country.

895
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,000
You know...

896
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:48,240
You know,
there's one thing about Americans.

897
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,720
We're not cut out to be occupiers.

898
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,680
We're new at it
and we're not very good at it.

899
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,760
We come over here, and what do we see?

900
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,960
We see this beautiful country.

901
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,000
It is beautiful. It's very beautiful.

902
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,040
We see the culture
that goes back for hundreds of years.

903
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,840
<i>We see its gemütlich charm,</i>

904
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:13,000
and the charm of people
like, uh... Mrs Bertholt.

905
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,360
We got a built-in inferiority complex.

906
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,160
We forgive and forget easy.

907
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:25,120
We give the other guy the benefit
of the doubt - that's the American way.

908
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:30,080
We beat the greatest war machine
since Alexander the Great

909
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:33,000
and now the boy scouts take over.

910
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,560
The trouble with you, Colonel,
is you'd like to indict the whole country.

911
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:40,080
That might be
emotionally satisfying to you,

912
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,440
but it wouldn't be exactly practical,
and hardly fair.

913
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,720
Hardly fair?

914
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,360
"Hare",

915
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:53,760
"hunter",

916
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,840
"field".

917
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,120
That's right, let's be fair.

918
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,200
The hare was shot
by the hunter in the field.

919
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,560
It's really quite simple.

920
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,520
Uh...

921
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,080
Colonel, I think we ought to be going.

922
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,240
Yes. We shouldn't be discussing this.

923
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:18,040
Oh, no, Judge(!)
We're fair Americans, and true blue.

924
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,440
We mustn't do anything
that's out of order.

925
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,920
We can't do anything that's out of order.

926
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:31,040
There are no Nazis in Germany.
Didn't you know that, Judge?

927
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,680
The Eskimos invaded Germany
and took over.

928
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,600
That's how all those
terrible things happened.

929
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:41,640
It wasn't the fault of the Germans,
it was the fault of those damn Eskimos!

930
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,560
Excuse me. Excuse me.

931
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,800
- Good night, Colonel.
- Good night.

932
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,720
<i>(music stops)</i>

933
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:05,800
Can I have your attention?
Sorry to interrupt your dancing.

934
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:09,480
The following officers are
requested to report to their units.

935
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,240
Major McCarthy, Major Citron,
Major Cantor,

936
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,840
Captain Byers, Captain Connell,

937
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:21,520
Captain Douglas, Captain Wolfe,
Major Booth and Major Rice.

938
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:24,720
Thank you. You can continue dancing.

939
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:26,840
<i>(music starts)</i>

940
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:31,160
- Harry! What is it?
- The Russians are in Czechoslovakia.

941
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,800
Masaryk may have committed suicide.
We're sending some units over.

942
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,960
<i>(lves) What do you think will happen?</i>

943
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,040
I don't know, sir.

944
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,840
Oh, Judge Haywood.

945
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,320
Elsa Scheffler.

946
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,480
<i>Guten Abend.</i>

947
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,560
<i>Guten Abend.</i>

948
01:16:55,240 --> 01:17:00,040
"President Truman responded by calling
for an extension of military training."

949
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:04,560
"He stated that he is deeply concerned
with the survival of the Western nations

950
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:07,480
in face of the threat from the east."

951
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,360
"Threat from the east."

952
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:13,360
Herr Janning, did you hear
what is in the paper?

953
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:17,640
Exactly what Hitler said: "The clash
for survival between east and west."

954
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,880
Ah, he knew. He knew!

955
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,600
They'll see that we knew exactly
what we were doing all the time.

956
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:27,800
They cannot call us criminals
and at the same time ask us to help them.

957
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,880
We must stand together now. The most
crucial part of this case is coming up.

958
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,720
We have fallen on happy times,
Herr Hahn.

959
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:38,000
In the old times
it would have made your day

960
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,320
if I deigned to say
"Good morning" to you.

961
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,840
Now that we are here
in this place together,

962
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,040
you feel obliged to tell me
what to do with my life.

963
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,120
Herr Janning, you must stand with us.

964
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:53,680
It is not good for Germans to turn on one
another. We have a common ground now.

965
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,680
Listen to me, Herr Hahn.

966
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,600
Terrible things have
happened to me in my life.

967
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,840
But the worst thing
that has ever happened

968
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,800
is to find myself
in the company of men like you.

969
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,560
I have nothing in common with you
and the party hacks.

970
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:09,960
You have something in common -
you were part of the same regime.

971
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,480
You stood by that regime,
like the rest of us.

972
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,640
And there is something else
you have in common:

973
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,720
You are a German.

974
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,640
<i>("Piano Sonata No.8" by Beethoven)</i>

975
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:51,400

- Yes, I did. Very much indeed.

976
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,200
- Can I drop you?
- I only live a few blocks from here.

977
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,680
I was going to walk.
Would you like to go for a walk?

978
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,960
Yes. Yes, I would.

979
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:02,000
I won't need the car now.
I'll walk with Mrs Bertholt.

980
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:04,080
- Shall I wait for you?
- No, no.

981
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,760
I'll wait for you, Your Honour.

The German people love to sing,
no matter what the situation.

991
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,640
I've noticed that.

992
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:52,280
Do American people sing in bars, too?
I've forgotten.

993
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,760
No. We're apt to be pretty sullen in bars.

Very sad.

998
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:16,600
Much sadder than the English words.

- Yes, I have a daughter,

01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,240
What is your position in America?
It must be important.

1017
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:29,640
No, it isn't really.
I'm a district court judge.

1018
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,240
I haven't even been that for the last year.

1019
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:36,400
- Are you retired?
- Forcibly, by the electorate.

1020
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:39,440
You elect judges in the United States?

1021
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:43,520
- Yes, in some states.
- I didn't know that.

1022
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:46,960
It's either a virtue or a defect
of our judiciary system.

1023
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:51,160
I thought it was one of the virtues
until last year, when I was defeated.

1024
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:54,400
I'm sure it was the fault
of the electorate, not yours.

1025
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:59,160
There seems to be some difference
of opinion about that.

1026
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:03,800
- This is where I live.
- Here?

1027
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,040
Yes. It's not so bad inside.

1028
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,600
Would you like to come up?
I could make some coffee.

1029
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,680
Yes, thank you.

1030
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,120
Things haven't been very easy
for you, have they?

1031
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,320
I'm not used to them being easy.

1032
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:35,160
I'm not fragile, Judge Haywood.

1033
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,600
I'm a daughter of the military.

1034
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:41,720
- You know what that means, don't you?
- No, I'm afraid I don't.

1035
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:44,600
It means I was taught discipline.

1036
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,480
A very special kind of discipline.

1037
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:52,000
For instance, as a child we would go for
long rides into the country in the summer.

1038
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:56,240
But I was never allowed to run
to the lemonade stand with the others.

1039
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:59,640
I was told "Control your thirst."

1040
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,600
"Control hunger."

1041
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,400
"Control emotion."

1042
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,480
It has served me well.

1043
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:12,160
And your husband?
Was he of that heritage, too?

1044
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:16,120
My husband was a soldier.
He was brought up to do one thing -

1045
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,280
to fight in the battle and fight well.

1046
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:24,360
- Is the coffee all right?
- Fine, thank you.

1047
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,880
It's ersatz,
but I always try to make it strong.

1048
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,200
It's fine.

1049
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,880
I'm curious.

1050
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:40,000
What do you think of Ernst Janning?

1051
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:46,560
Mrs Bertholt, I'm not at liberty to discuss
the case outside of the courtroom.

1052
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,000
Oh, yes. Of course.

1053
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:58,040
I knew Ernst Janning a little.
We used to attend the same concerts.

1054
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:01,600
There was a reception given
for Wagner's daughter-in-law.

1055
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:03,600
Hitler was there.

1056
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:06,760
Ernst Janning was there with his wife.

1057
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,920
She was very beautiful.

1058
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,280
Very small, very delicate.

1059
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:13,440
She's dead now.

1060
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,280
Hitler was quite taken with her.

1061
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,960
He made advances towards her
during the reception.

1062
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:22,640
He used to do things like that
in a burst of emotion.

1063
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:26,000
I will never forget the way
Ernst Janning cut him down.

1064
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:29,280
I don't think anybody
did it to him quite that way.

1065
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:36,080
He said "Chancellor, I do not object
so much that you are so ill-mannered."

1066
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:39,280
"I do not object to that so much."

1067
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:42,000
"I object that you are such a bourgeois."

1068
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:47,520
Hitler whitened,
stared at Janning and walked out.

1069
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:53,560
Is the coffee really all right?

1070
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:55,640
Fine, thank you.

1071
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:02,520
Men like Janning, my husband and I,
we hated Hitler.

1072
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:06,560
I want you to know that.
And he hated us.

1073
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:09,960
He hated my husband
because he was a real war hero,

1074
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,760
and the little corporal
couldn't tolerate that.

1075
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:18,840
And he hated him because he married
into nobility, which was my family.

1076
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:23,000
Hitler was in awe of the nobility,
but he hated it.

1077
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:27,600
That's why it's so ironic, what happened.

1078
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,880
You know what happened
to my husband?

1079
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,400
Yes.

1080
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:39,400
What did he know
of the crimes they cited him for?

1081
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:43,040
He was placed on trial
with the other military leaders.

1082
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:48,640
He was part of the revenge the victors
always take on the vanquished.

1083
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,800
It was political murder.

1084
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,840
You can see that, can't you?

1085
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,160
Mrs Bertholt, I don't know what I see.

1086
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:04,240
I probably shouldn't be here
talking with you about this at all.

1087
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:08,120
I want to understand.
I do want to understand.

1088
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:11,040
I have to.

1089
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:26,320
Would you like some more coffee?

1090
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:28,400
Yes, thank you.

1091
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:39,200
- Hi.
- Hi.

1092
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,120
We found Irene Hoffman.

1093
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:48,520
- Where?
- Berlin.

1094
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:50,000
Berlin, eh?

1095
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:54,880
She got married. Her name is Wallner
now. That's why we couldn't locate her.

1096
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,880
- When is she coming?
- She's not coming.

1097
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,600
- What do you mean, she's not coming?
- She doesn't want to come.

1098
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:06,000
You know what it's like.
None of them want to testify any more.

1099
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:11,640
If I catch the midnight, I can get to Berlin
and be back by tomorrow afternoon.

1100
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,000
- Tad, you haven't slept...
- It will be worth it if I can get Hoffman.

1101
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:18,320
Take over for me in court in the morning,
will you?

1102
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:12,720
<i>(man) Colonel, please. I have told you this
before when you first came in.</i>

1103
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:16,520
I say it again now:
We are through with all this.

1104
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:19,400
She does not have to go.
You have no right to order her to.

1105
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:24,240
Mr Wallner, I'm not ordering her to go.
I have no authority to do that.

1106
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:27,360
Do you think we get a medal
for appearing at these trials?

1107
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:31,720
The people do not like them, they do not
want Germans to testify against Germans.

1108
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:39,600
I haven't been prosecuting these cases for
the past two years without knowing that.

1109
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,960
It is easy for you to say go.

1110
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:50,720
After the trials you go back to America,
but we must live with these people.

1111
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:54,280
Mr Wallner, don't you think
I realise what I'm asking?

1112
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,360
How can you come in like the Gestapo...

1113
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,240
Because they must not be allowed
to get away with what they did!

1114
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:06,120
Do you really think
they won't get away with it in the end?

1115
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:10,720
I say the hell with them
and the hell with you.

1116
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,640
Hugo.

1117
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:24,900
Emil Hahn will be there?

1118
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:28,500
Yes. In the dock.

1119
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:33,140
Ernst Janning?

1120
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:36,620
Yes.

1121
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:47,900
You saw the store downstairs.

1122
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:54,620
It's not much, but it's a new start for us.

1123
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:00,140
They will come if I go to Nuremberg.

1124
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:06,700
They will come
and break the windows of the store.

1125
01:31:06,820 --> 01:31:09,580
I'll place a guard in front
of the store 24 hours a day.

1126
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:14,300
- You do not have to go, Irene...
- Irene, you do have to go.

1127
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:18,340
You have to go for all the people
who can't get on the stand themselves.

1128
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:22,500
- You do not owe it to anybody, Irene.
- Yes, you do!

1129
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:28,060
You owe it to one person at least.

1130
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:38,620
<i>(sobs)</i>

1131
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:49,660
In the night...

1132
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:51,740
every night...

1133
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:56,820
we've known somehow
it would come to this.

1134
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:15,660
<i>(Radnitz) Dr Geuter,
do you recognise that headline?</i>

1135
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:16,980
Yes, sir.

1136
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:19,540
Would you read it to the tribunal?

1137
01:32:19,660 --> 01:32:21,740
"Death to the race defiler."

1138
01:32:21,860 --> 01:32:26,660
<i>- In what newspaper did it appear?
- Julius Streicher's Der Stürmer.</i>

1139
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:29,900
What was it in connection with?

1140
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:31,940
The Feldenstein case.

1141
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:34,300
What was the Feldenstein case?

1142
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:38,700
Your Honour! The defence objects
to introduction of the Feldenstein case.

1143
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:42,420
It is a notorious case,
perhaps the most notorious of the period.

1144
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:49,020
It has overtones and appeals to emotion
that would perhaps be best not raised.

1145
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:54,140
There are no issues or overtones
that may not be raised in this courtroom.

1146
01:32:54,260 --> 01:33:00,900
The tribunal is interested in everything
that is relevant. Objection is overruled.

1147
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:05,620
It's all right. I'll take it.

1148
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:11,740
- May it please the tribunal?
- You may continue.

1149
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:13,820
Thank you.

1150
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:25,780
Now, what was the Feldenstein case?

1151
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:30,220
The case of a man
accused of racial pollution.

1152
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:34,220
Will you explain what is meant
by "racial pollution"?

1153
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:40,180
This is the charge that is
referred to in the Nuremberg laws.

1154
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:46,500
Any non-Aryan having sexual relations
with an Aryan may be punished by death.

1155
01:33:46,620 --> 01:33:51,060
When did you first become acquainted
with the Feldenstein case?

1156
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:55,900
In September 1935
I was contacted by the police.

1157
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:59,140
They said that Mr Feldenstein
was being held

1158
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:03,420
and that he requested
that I serve as his counsellor.

1159
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:05,820
What position did he hold
in the community?

1160
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:08,500
He was a very well-known merchant.

1161
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:12,820
He was one of the heads of
the Jewish Congregation in Nuremberg.

1162
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:16,580
What was the nature
of the charge against him?

1163
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:20,740
He was accused
of having intimate relations

1164
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:24,540
with a 16-year-old girl, Irene Hoffman.

1165
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:27,660
<i>(Lawson) I see.</i>

1166
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:31,620
And what did he say
to you about the case?

1167
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:33,540
He said it was false.

1168
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:36,460
He said he knew the girl
and her family a long time.

1169
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:38,820
He'd gone to visit her since they died.

1170
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:42,660
But there had never been anything
of the kind charged between them.

1171
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:49,340
Doctor, would you please tell
the tribunal what happened then?

1172
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:54,060
He was indicted before
the special court at Nuremberg.

1173
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:56,420
<i>(Lawson) Where was this special court?</i>

1174
01:34:56,540 --> 01:35:01,140
It was right here. This building.
This very courtroom.

1175
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:06,860
Dr Geuter, what were the circumstances
surrounding the trial?

1176
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:13,660
It was used as a showplace
for National Socialism.

1177
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:20,980
It was the time of the September
celebrations, the Nuremberg rallies.

1178
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:23,740
The courtroom was crowded.

1179
01:35:23,860 --> 01:35:26,900
Back there, people were standing up.

1180
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:31,940
Julius Streicher was sitting
in one of the front seats.

1181
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:36,100
And high officials of
the Nazi party were all over.

1182
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:39,900
Doctor, would you please tell us

1183
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:44,060
what were your expectations
for the trial in this climate?

1184
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:46,500
I expected the worst

1185
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:51,780
when I saw that Emil Hahn
was the public prosecutor.

1186
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:54,420
He was a fanatic.

1187
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:59,500
His trials were always
marked by extreme brutality.

1188
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:06,700
But I had one hope for the outcome,

1189
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:14,220
because sitting on the judge's bench
was Ernst Janning.

1190
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:19,340
His reputation was known
throughout Germany.

1191
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:24,340
He was known to have
dedicated his life to justice,

1192
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:26,780
to the concept of justice.

1193
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:31,820
Thank you. That's all.

1194
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:36,660
<i>(Haywood) Any questions?</i>

1195
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:40,140
Thank you. No questions.

1196
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:42,220
<i>(Haywood) The witness is excused.</i>

1197
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:48,980
The prosecution calls to the stand
Irene Hoffman Wallner.

1198
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:14,580
Will you raise your right hand?

1199
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:16,500
I swear by God the Almighty
and Omniscient

1200
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:19,620
that I will speak the pure truth
and withhold and add nothing.

1201
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:21,700
I do.

1202
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:28,580
Will you please state your name
to the tribunal?

1203
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:33,940
Irene Hoffman Wallner.

1204
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:39,380
Mrs Wallner,
did you know Lehman Feldenstein?

1205
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:41,260
Yes.

1206
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:43,900
When did you first meet him?

1207
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:50,260
It was 1925 or 1926.
I am not sure exactly.

1208
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:54,980
- How old was he at this time?
- He was in his fifties.

1209
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:58,540
And how old was he
at the time of his arrest?

1210
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:03,620
- He was 65.
- I see.

1211
01:38:04,820 --> 01:38:07,460
What was the nature of your relationship?

1212
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:11,300
We were friends.

1213
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:15,140
Did you continue to see him
after your parents died?

1214
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:18,660
- Yes.
- Why?

1215
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:24,900
We were friends.
He owned the building that I lived in.

1216
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:28,860
His business took him there quite often.

1217
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:33,060
Now, what did you say to the police

1218
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:37,780
when they questioned you about having
intimate relations with him?

1219
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:42,180
I told them it was a lie.

1220
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:44,980
Could you tell me
who the public prosecutor was?

1221
01:38:48,860 --> 01:38:51,340
Emil Hahn.

1222
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:55,700
- Did Emil Hahn question you?
- Yes.

1223
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:57,780
What did he say to you?

1224
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:04,340
He... took me into a separate room

1225
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:07,460
where we were alone.

1226
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:12,860
He told me that it was no use
to repeat my story

1227
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:16,660
because no one would believe me.

1228
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:21,060
That there had been race defilement,

1229
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:25,820
and the only pardon for this
was to kill the violator.

1230
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:34,540
He told me that
if I protected Mr Feldenstein,

1231
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:39,340
that I would be held
under arrest for perjury.

1232
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:42,580
What did you reply to him?

1233
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:47,220
I told him what I had said,
again and again.

1234
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:51,380
I told him that I could not
say anything else,

1235
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:55,980
I could not lie about someone
who had been so kind to me.

1236
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:58,780
Were you held under arrest?

1237
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:01,380
Yes.

1238
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:04,260
Mrs Wallner, tell us,

1239
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:11,940
what was the manner in which
Emil Hahn conducted the prosecution?

1240
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:18,500
He made a mockery

1241
01:40:18,620 --> 01:40:24,060
of everything Mr Feldenstein
tried to say in his own defence.

1242
01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:29,420
He held him up to ridicule
whenever possible.

1243
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:32,780
What was the reaction of the audience?

1244
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:37,660
They laughed again and again.

1245
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:42,620
How long did the trial last?

1246
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:46,580
Mrs Wallner?

1247
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:49,180
How long did the trial last?

1248
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:52,260
Two days.

1249
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:56,060
Was the verdict passed
at the end of the second day?

1250
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:57,140
Yes.

1251
01:40:57,260 --> 01:41:00,860
- What was the verdict?
- Guilty.

1252
01:41:00,980 --> 01:41:03,500
And what was the sentence?

1253
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:09,900
Mr Feldenstein was sentenced
to be executed.

1254
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:15,860
I was sentenced to be in prison
for two years for perjury.

1255
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:21,860
Who was the presiding judge?

1256
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:25,180
Ernst Janning.

1257
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:28,940
Were the sentences carried out?

1258
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:37,740
Thank you very much, Mrs Wallner.
That's all.

1259
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:45,020
Any questions?

1260
01:41:56,540 --> 01:42:02,580
Your Honour, I would like to request
that the witness be kept available.

1261
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:05,980
We will present further evidence
on the Feldenstein matter

1262
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:09,340
when it comes time
for the defence to present its case.

1263
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:16,260
The witness will please
hold herself so available.

1264
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:18,700
You may go. You're excused now.

1265
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:42,260
<i>(Haywood) Colonel Lawson.</i>

1266
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:52,020
Your Honours, I offer in evidence
a decree, signed by Adolf Hitler,

1267
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:55,980
directing that all persons
accused or suspected of disloyalty

1268
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:58,100
or resistance of any sort

1269
01:42:58,220 --> 01:43:00,500
might be arrested secretly,

1270
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:04,660
with no notice to friends or relatives,
without any trial whatsoever,

1271
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:07,500
and put into concentration camps.

1272
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:12,140
I also offer a group of orders
issued under that decree,

1273
01:43:12,260 --> 01:43:15,580
each one signed by one of the defendants,

1274
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:17,740
by which hundreds of persons
were arrested

1275
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:20,580
and placed in concentration camps.

1276
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:24,100
Signed by Friedrich Hofstetter,

1277
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:26,180
Werner Lampe,

1278
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:29,260
Emil Hahn,

1279
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:32,060
Ernst Janning.

1280
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:39,140
Your Honours,
the defendants on trial here today

1281
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:43,860
did not personally administer
the concentration camps.

1282
01:43:43,980 --> 01:43:46,820
They never had to beat victims,

1283
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:50,540
or pull the lever that released gas
into the chambers.

1284
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:56,060
But as the documents we have
introduced into this case have shown,

1285
01:43:56,180 --> 01:44:00,260
these defendants fashioned
and executed laws,

1286
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:02,660
and rendered judgments

1287
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:09,300
which sent millions of victims
to their destinations.

1288
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:11,580
Major Radnitz.

1289
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:17,380
Your Honours, I would like to request that
Colonel Lawson be sworn in as a witness.

1290
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,460
- Granted.
- Thank you.

1291
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:26,860
Will you raise your right hand?

1292
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:28,740
I swear by God
the Almighty and Omniscient

1293
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:31,500
that I will speak the pure truth
and withhold and add nothing.

1294
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:33,580
I do.

1295
01:44:35,740 --> 01:44:39,980
Were you active in the United States
army in 1945 at the close of the war?

1296
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:41,660
Yes, I was.

1297
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:45,340
Were you in command of troops
liberating concentration camps?

1298
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:47,060
I was.

1299
01:44:47,180 --> 01:44:50,900
- Were you in Dachau and Belsen?
- Yes.

1300
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:54,060
Were you present when the films
we are about to see were taken?

1301
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:56,140
Yes, I was.

1302
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:24,100
OK.

1303
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:36,740
The map shows the number of
and location of concentration camps

1304
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:39,780
under the Third Reich.

1305
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:46,460
Buchenwald concentration camp
was founded in 1933.

1306
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:51,060
Its inmates numbered about 80,000.

1307
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:55,780
There was a motto at Buchenwald:

1308
01:45:56,260 --> 01:45:58,220
"Break the body,

1309
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:02,820
break the spirit,

1310
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:07,420
break the heart."

1311
01:46:08,700 --> 01:46:10,980
The ovens at Buchenwald,

1312
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:17,100
evidence of last-minute efforts
to dispose of bodies.

1313
01:46:17,220 --> 01:46:21,620
The stoves were manufactured
by a well-known company

1314
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:26,300
which also specialised in baking ovens.

1315
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:29,620
The name of the firm is clearly inscribed.

1316
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:33,460
An exhibit of by-products of Buchenwald,

1317
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:39,380
displayed for the local townspeople
by an Allied officer.

1318
01:46:39,820 --> 01:46:41,860
Brushes of every description.

1319
01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:45,540
Shoes - adults' and children's.

1320
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:48,740
Spectacles.

1321
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:50,860
Gold from teeth, melted down,

1322
01:46:50,980 --> 01:46:56,180
sent once a month to the medical
department of the Waffen SS.

1323
01:46:56,300 --> 01:46:59,380
A lampshade made from human skin.

1324
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:04,260
Skin being used for paintings,

1325
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:08,380
many having an obscene nature.

1326
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:12,740
The heads of two Polish labourers,

1327
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:17,300
shrunken to one-fifth
their normal size.

1328
01:47:17,420 --> 01:47:21,100
A human pelvis used as an ashtray.

1329
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:31,140
Children who had been tattooed
to mark them for eventual extermination.

1330
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:36,860
Sometimes mercy was shown
to the children.

1331
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:39,820
They were injected with morphia

1332
01:47:39,940 --> 01:47:43,380
so they'd be unconscious when hanged.

1333
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:47,940
One of the doctors described how they'd
then place ropes around their necks,

1334
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:50,460
and in the doctor's own words:

1335
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:56,540
"Like pictures, they were then
hanged by hooks on the walls."

1336
01:48:00,260 --> 01:48:03,780
The bodies of those
who had come in boxcars,

1337
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:06,460
without food and without air,

1338
01:48:06,580 --> 01:48:10,700
who hadn't survived
the journey to Dachau.

1339
01:48:10,820 --> 01:48:13,380
Hundreds of inmates
were used as human guinea pigs

1340
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:17,100
for atrocious medical experiments.

1341
01:48:19,180 --> 01:48:24,820
A witness at an execution at Dachau
gave the following description:

1342
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:29,020
"Inmates were made
to leave their clothing on a rack."

1343
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:33,060
"They were told
they were going to take baths."

1344
01:48:33,180 --> 01:48:36,060
"Then the doors were locked."

1345
01:48:36,180 --> 01:48:41,660
"Tins of Zyklon B were released through
the specially constructed apertures."

1346
01:48:43,420 --> 01:48:48,180
"You could hear the groaning
and the whimpering inside."

1347
01:48:48,340 --> 01:48:52,460
"After two or three minutes,
all was quiet."

1348
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:06,020
Death transports that had arrived
included 90,000 from Slovakia,

1349
01:49:07,820 --> 01:49:10,460
65,000 from Greece,

1350
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:13,900
11,000 from France,

1351
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:18,540
90,000 from Holland,

1352
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:23,420
400,000 from Hungary,

1353
01:49:25,940 --> 01:49:29,380
250,000 from Poland and Upper Silesia,

1354
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:34,140
and 100,000 from Germany.

1355
01:49:37,460 --> 01:49:39,420
And this is what was filmed

1356
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:43,420
when British troops liberated
Belsen concentration camp.

1357
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:52,100
For sanitary reasons a British bulldozer
had to bury the bodies

1358
01:49:52,220 --> 01:49:54,180
as quickly as possible.

1359
01:50:00,540 --> 01:50:02,900
Who were the bodies?

1360
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:07,940
Members of every
occupied country of Europe.

1361
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:14,260
Two-thirds of the Jews of Europe...
exterminated.

1362
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:17,860
More than six million,

1363
01:50:19,140 --> 01:50:23,540
according to reports
from the Nazis' own figures.

1364
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:28,940
But the real figure...

1365
01:50:33,740 --> 01:50:35,700
no one knows.

1366
01:50:42,180 --> 01:50:46,140
How dare they show us those films?
How dare they?

1367
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:50,220
We are not executioners!
We are judges.

1368
01:50:50,340 --> 01:50:53,580
You do not think it was like that, do you?

1369
01:50:55,220 --> 01:50:58,780
There were executions, yes,
but nothing like that.

1370
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:00,860
Nothing at all!

1371
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:08,140
Pohl!

1372
01:51:08,580 --> 01:51:10,540
Pohl!

1373
01:51:12,260 --> 01:51:16,700
You ran those concentration camps,
you and Eichmann.

1374
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:20,820
They say we killed millions of people.

1375
01:51:20,940 --> 01:51:22,820
Millions of people!

1376
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:25,660
How could it be possible?

1377
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:29,460
Tell them!
How could it be possible?

1378
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:34,340
It's possible.

1379
01:51:35,260 --> 01:51:37,140
How?

1380
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:39,220
You mean technically?

1381
01:51:41,020 --> 01:51:43,660
It all depends on your facilities.

1382
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:48,020
Say you have two chambers that
accommodate 2,000 people apiece.

1383
01:51:48,140 --> 01:51:50,220
Figure it out.

1384
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:54,740
It's possible to get rid
of 10,000 in a half hour.

1385
01:51:54,860 --> 01:51:57,460
You don't even need guards to do it.

1386
01:51:57,580 --> 01:52:00,460
You can tell them
they are going to take a shower,

1387
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:04,620
and then instead of the water,
you turn on the gas.

1388
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:10,420
It's not the killing that is the problem.
It's disposing of the bodies.

1389
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:12,500
That's the problem.

1390
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:23,020
<i>Das ist schön</i>

1391
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:25,020
<i>Wunderschön</i>

1392
01:52:25,140 --> 01:52:27,100
<i>Das tut gut</i>

1393
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:33,420
<i>Was man alles im Liebesrausch tut</i>

1394
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:39,300
<i>Und zur Nacht fliegt
ein flüsterndes Fleh'n</i>

1395
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:46,540
<i>"ach verweile,
du bist ja so schön"</i>

1396
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:52,380
<i>Doch die Liebe bleibt nur, wo sie ist</i>

1397
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:59,020
<i>Wenn man immer aufs neue sich küsst</i>

1398
01:52:59,140 --> 01:53:00,540
<i>Und so lebt...</i>

1399
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:02,900
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- That's all right.

1400
01:53:03,020 --> 01:53:07,260
I was doing some work
for the rebuilding committee.

1401
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:12,580
I brought you some folders so we can
decide what you should see next.

1402
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:15,980
There's the Albrecht Dürer house.
And the museum.

1403
01:53:16,100 --> 01:53:19,660
- When do you think you could make it?
- Any time.

1404
01:53:19,780 --> 01:53:24,100
- Would you like to order now?
- Can I help you with the menu?

1405
01:53:24,220 --> 01:53:26,660
I don't think I'll have anything, thank you.

1406
01:53:26,780 --> 01:53:28,980
A glass of Moselle, please.

1407
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:31,060
Moselle.

1408
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:35,460
What is the matter?

1409
01:53:35,580 --> 01:53:39,020
Nothing. I'm just not hungry, that's all.

1410
01:53:45,580 --> 01:53:47,540
You know...

1411
01:53:49,020 --> 01:53:52,140
the last few days have
meant a great deal to me.

1412
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:54,180
How?

1413
01:53:54,300 --> 01:53:59,140
I don't think you realise
what a provincial man I really am.

1414
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:03,820
I've been abroad
just exactly once before this.

1415
01:54:03,940 --> 01:54:06,540
That was when I was a doughboy
in World War I.

1416
01:54:06,660 --> 01:54:10,580
I used to pass places like this
and wonder what they were like.

1417
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:13,780
- They've meant a great deal to me, too.
- How?

1418
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:16,980
They gave me back the feeling
I had of the Americans.

1419
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:21,340
The feeling I used to have
when I was in your country.

1420
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:26,420
It's too bad
this isn't a magazine story.

1421
01:54:26,540 --> 01:54:27,540
Why?

1422
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:31,980
If it were, two people like us,
the rapidly ageing jurist...

1423
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:33,500
Oh, no.

1424
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:37,100
The rapidly ageing jurist
and the beautiful widow

1425
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:43,780
would transcend their difficulties
and travel places either by land or by sea.

1426
01:54:57,300 --> 01:54:59,380
I saw Mr Perkins today.

1427
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:03,180
He told me they showed
those pictures in the courtroom,

1428
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:05,620
Colonel Lawson's favourite pictures.

1429
01:55:06,500 --> 01:55:09,420
He drags them out at any pretext,
doesn't he?

1430
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:12,700
Colonel Lawson's private
chamber of horrors.

1431
01:55:15,660 --> 01:55:20,380
Is that what you think we are?
Do you think we knew of those things?

1432
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:24,740
Do you think we wanted
to murder women and children?

1433
01:55:25,860 --> 01:55:29,220
Do you believe that? Do you?

1434
01:55:31,060 --> 01:55:34,540
Mrs Bertholt, I don't
know what to believe.

1435
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:38,300
Good God.
We're sitting here drinking.

1436
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:41,060
How could you think that we knew?

1437
01:55:41,220 --> 01:55:43,340
We did not know.

1438
01:55:43,460 --> 01:55:45,420
We did not know!

1439
01:55:47,420 --> 01:55:51,580
As far as I can make out,
no one in this country knew.

1440
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:57,780
Mrs Bertholt, your husband
was one of the heads of the army.

1441
01:55:57,900 --> 01:56:00,660
And he did not know.
I tell you, he did not know.

1442
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:04,220
It was Himmler. It was Goebbels.
The SS knew what happened.

1443
01:56:04,340 --> 01:56:06,100
We did not know.

1444
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:10,500
Listen to me. There are things
that happened on both sides.

1445
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:13,780
My husband was a military man
all his life.

1446
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:17,620
He was entitled to a soldier's death.
He asked for that.

1447
01:56:17,740 --> 01:56:21,860
I tried to get that for him. Just that,
that he would die with some honour.

1448
01:56:21,980 --> 01:56:26,580
I went from official to official.
I begged for that!

1449
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:30,860
That he should be permitted
the dignity of a firing squad.

1450
01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:33,540
You know what happened.

1451
01:56:34,820 --> 01:56:40,660
He was hanged with the others.
And after that, I knew what it was to hate.

1452
01:56:40,780 --> 01:56:44,740
I never left the house.
I never left the room. I drank.

1453
01:56:44,860 --> 01:56:50,860
I hated with every fibre of my being.
I hated every American I've ever known.

1454
01:56:50,980 --> 01:56:54,340
But one can't live with hate. I know that.

1455
01:56:57,900 --> 01:57:00,180
Dan,

1456
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:04,420
we have to forget if we are to go on living.

1457
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:06,260
<i>(crowd singing "Liebeslied")</i>

1458
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:08,260
<i>Du darfst auf mich bauen</i>

1459
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:11,380
<i>Weißt ja, wie gut ich dir bin</i>

1460
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:15,300
<i>Ja, ja, ja, ja</i>

1461
01:57:15,420 --> 01:57:19,060
<i>Weisst doch, wie gut ich dir bin.</i>

1462
01:57:19,180 --> 01:57:23,060
<i>Und, und, wenn in der Ferne</i>

1463
01:57:23,180 --> 01:57:26,820
<i>Dir, dir, mein Bild erscheint</i>

1464
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:30,340
<i>Dann, dann, wünscht' ich so gerne</i>

1465
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:33,140
<i>Dass uns die Liebe vereint</i>

1466
01:57:51,020 --> 01:57:52,980
Herr Rolfe.

1467
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:14,860
May it please the tribunal.

1468
01:58:19,980 --> 01:58:23,820
Yesterday the tribunal
witnessed some films.

1469
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:29,780
They were... shocking films.

1470
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:32,500
Devastating films.

1471
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:36,020
As a German,

1472
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:43,940
I feel ashamed that such things
could have taken place in my country.

1473
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:49,940
There can never be
a justification for them,

1474
01:58:50,060 --> 01:58:54,660
not in generations, not in centuries.

1475
01:58:58,380 --> 01:59:00,340
But...

1476
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:05,820
I do think it was wrong,

1477
01:59:07,580 --> 01:59:09,540
indecent

1478
01:59:10,420 --> 01:59:14,060
and terribly unfair of the prosecution

1479
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:21,860
to show such films in this case,
in this court, at this time

1480
01:59:21,980 --> 01:59:24,620
against these defendants!

1481
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:30,020
And I cannot protest too strongly
against such tactics.

1482
01:59:37,260 --> 01:59:40,980
What is the prosecution trying to prove?

1483
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:46,100
That the German people as a whole
were responsible for these events?

1484
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:49,020
Or that they were even aware of them?

1485
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:51,380
Because, if he is,

1486
01:59:52,980 --> 01:59:55,180
he's not stating facts

1487
01:59:56,420 --> 01:59:58,940
and he knows he's not.

1488
02:00:01,460 --> 02:00:04,020
The secrecy of the operations,

1489
02:00:04,140 --> 02:00:06,620
the geographical location of the camps,

1490
02:00:06,740 --> 02:00:10,260
the breakdown of communications
in the last days of the war

1491
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:13,060
when the exterminations
rose into the millions,

1492
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:17,300
show only too clearly
that he is not telling the truth.

1493
02:00:17,420 --> 02:00:24,060
The truth is that these brutalities
were brought about by the few extremists.

1494
02:00:24,180 --> 02:00:26,140
The criminals.

1495
02:00:27,860 --> 02:00:30,940
Very few Germans knew
what was going on.

1496
02:00:31,060 --> 02:00:33,020
Very few.

1497
02:00:34,020 --> 02:00:39,700
None of us knew what was happening
in the places shown on these films.

1498
02:00:40,940 --> 02:00:42,900
None of us.

1499
02:00:48,260 --> 02:00:51,540
But the most ironic part of it

1500
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:57,940
is that the prosecution showed
these films against these defendants,

1501
02:00:58,060 --> 02:01:02,740
men who stayed in power
for one reason only:

1502
02:01:02,860 --> 02:01:06,220
To prevent worse things from happening.

1503
02:01:07,100 --> 02:01:09,660
Who is the braver man?

1504
02:01:09,780 --> 02:01:13,740
The man who escapes
or resigns in times of peril?

1505
02:01:14,580 --> 02:01:20,540
Or the man who stays on his post
at the risk of his own personal safety?

1506
02:01:21,180 --> 02:01:25,300
The defence will present witnesses
and letters and documents

1507
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:27,860
from religious and political
refugees all over the world

1508
02:01:27,980 --> 02:01:31,020
telling how Ernst Janning
saved them from execution.

1509
02:01:31,140 --> 02:01:33,580
The defence will show the many times

1510
02:01:33,700 --> 02:01:36,620
Ernst Janning was able
to effect mitigation of sentences,

1511
02:01:36,740 --> 02:01:41,460
when without his influence
the results would have been much worse.

1512
02:01:41,580 --> 02:01:44,020
The defence will show

1513
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:49,220
that Ernst Janning's personal
physician was a non-Aryan.

1514
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:54,620
A Jewish man who he kept in attendance,
much to his own peril.

1515
02:01:58,420 --> 02:02:01,540
The defence presents affidavits

1516
02:02:01,660 --> 02:02:05,460
from legal authorities
and famed jurists the world over,

1517
02:02:05,580 --> 02:02:09,580
pleading that special consideration
must be made in this case,

1518
02:02:09,700 --> 02:02:15,700
saying that the entire work of Ernst
Janning was inspired by one motive only:

1519
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:20,980
The endeavour to preserve justice
and the concept of justice.

1520
02:02:24,700 --> 02:02:32,580
Now, what has the prosecution
to offer against this?

1521
02:02:33,580 --> 02:02:38,340
The prosecution, in fact, has presented
in the case of Ernst Janning

1522
02:02:38,460 --> 02:02:41,340
only one tangible piece of evidence.

1523
02:02:41,460 --> 02:02:44,620
The Feldenstein case.
A notorious case, as the defence said.

1524
02:02:44,740 --> 02:02:47,180
A case which never should
have been reopened.

1525
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:52,260
A case which the defence
is obliged to review now.

1526
02:02:54,060 --> 02:02:56,580
The defence calls Mrs Elsa Lindnow.

1527
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:16,460
Will you raise your right hand?

1528
02:03:16,580 --> 02:03:18,460
I swear by God the Almighty
and Omniscient

1529
02:03:18,580 --> 02:03:21,660
that I will speak the pure truth
and withhold and add nothing.

1530
02:03:21,780 --> 02:03:23,740
I do.

1531
02:03:26,860 --> 02:03:28,820
Mrs Lindnow.

1532
02:03:31,340 --> 02:03:33,460
What is your occupation?

1533
02:03:33,580 --> 02:03:35,540
I am a cleaning woman.

1534
02:03:36,020 --> 02:03:38,740
Where are you employed?

1535
02:03:38,860 --> 02:03:43,780
4... 345 Grosseplatz.

1536
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:47,140
- Did you know Lehman Feldenstein?
- Yes, I knew him.

1537
02:03:47,260 --> 02:03:52,620
- In what capacity?
- He was my employer in 1935.

1538
02:03:52,740 --> 02:03:55,020
Do you know
Mrs Irene Hoffman Wallner?

1539
02:03:55,140 --> 02:03:56,420
Yes.

1540
02:03:56,540 --> 02:04:01,060
- In what capacity?
- She was a tenant in the building.

1541
02:04:01,180 --> 02:04:05,460
Did you ever see Miss Hoffman
and Mr Feldenstein together?

1542
02:04:05,580 --> 02:04:08,940
- Yes.
- How did this happen?

1543
02:04:09,060 --> 02:04:13,900
Mr Feldenstein came to see
Miss Hoffman at her apartment.

1544
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:17,700
- Often?
- Quite often.

1545
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:21,540
Were there any occasions in which
you noticed anything unusual?

1546
02:04:21,660 --> 02:04:23,620
Yes.

1547
02:04:23,740 --> 02:04:30,020
I saw Miss Hoffman kissing Mr
Feldenstein at the door of her apartment.

1548
02:04:30,140 --> 02:04:34,740
- Was there any other occasion?
- Yes. There was one.

1549
02:04:34,860 --> 02:04:39,300
- What was it?
- I came to Miss Hoffman's apartment.

1550
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:43,740
I wanted to clean up.
I thought it was empty.

1551
02:04:44,980 --> 02:04:50,700
I saw Miss Hoffman
sitting on Mr Feldenstein's lap.

1552
02:04:50,820 --> 02:04:53,980
Thank you, Mrs Lindnow. That's all.

1553
02:04:56,220 --> 02:04:58,180
Colonel Lawson?

1554
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:05,300
Earphones, please.

1555
02:05:07,900 --> 02:05:12,340
Mrs Lindnow, what are
your political affiliations?

1556
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:15,860
Political?

1557
02:05:15,980 --> 02:05:18,020
Objection, Your Honour.

1558
02:05:19,660 --> 02:05:23,580
This witness' political affiliations
have nothing to do with the testimony.

1559
02:05:23,700 --> 02:05:28,500
Colonel Lawson is again trying
to appeal to the emotion of the court.

1560
02:05:28,620 --> 02:05:30,580
Objection overruled.

1561
02:05:30,700 --> 02:05:32,980
Now would you answer
the question, please?

1562
02:05:33,100 --> 02:05:36,940
Were you a member
of the National Socialist party?

1563
02:05:37,060 --> 02:05:39,620
Yes, I was.

1564
02:05:41,140 --> 02:05:43,060
We were forced to be.

1565
02:05:43,180 --> 02:05:45,420
"We were forced to be."

1566
02:05:46,420 --> 02:05:49,180
When did you become
a member of the Nazi party?

1567
02:05:51,340 --> 02:05:54,620
1933.

1568
02:05:54,740 --> 02:06:01,100
Were all German nationals forced
to become Nazi party members in 1933?

1569
02:06:02,180 --> 02:06:04,380
Please answer me, Mrs Lindnow!

1570
02:06:04,500 --> 02:06:08,740
Were you forced to become
a member of the Nazi party?

1571
02:06:12,180 --> 02:06:13,940
That's all.

1572
02:06:15,180 --> 02:06:17,140
Witness is excused.

1573
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:34,420
Defence may continue.

1574
02:06:41,740 --> 02:06:46,300
The defence calls
Irene Hoffman Wallner to the stand.

1575
02:07:01,540 --> 02:07:03,500
<i>(Haywood) Mrs Wallner,</i>

1576
02:07:05,820 --> 02:07:07,860
you are still under oath.

1577
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:12,460
Mrs Wallner, did you
come here voluntarily?

1578
02:07:13,060 --> 02:07:16,220
Did you report voluntarily
to speak as a witness?

1579
02:07:16,340 --> 02:07:18,300
Yes.

1580
02:07:19,340 --> 02:07:22,700
Is it not true that the prosecution
asked you to come here?

1581
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:26,780
That it was very disagreeable
for you to come here?

1582
02:07:26,900 --> 02:07:30,860
It is always very disagreeable
to live over those times.

1583
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:35,500
That would be in agreement
with the information I have,

1584
02:07:35,620 --> 02:07:39,020
that you did not want to come.
Thank you, Mrs Wallner.

1585
02:07:39,180 --> 02:07:41,140
Mrs Wallner,

1586
02:07:43,580 --> 02:07:47,660
the Nuremberg laws
were stated September 15th, 1935.

1587
02:07:48,420 --> 02:07:51,100
- Where were you at that time?
- In Nuremberg.

1588
02:07:51,220 --> 02:07:53,180
Did you know these laws?

1589
02:07:53,300 --> 02:07:58,180
That a physical relationship
with Jews was against the law?

1590
02:07:58,300 --> 02:07:59,260
Yes.

1591
02:07:59,380 --> 02:08:04,100
Were you aware that in Nuremberg,
and in Nuremberg in particular,

1592
02:08:04,220 --> 02:08:08,940
not only a physical relationship with Jews
was disdained, but every social contact?

1593
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:10,740
Yes.

1594
02:08:10,860 --> 02:08:14,580
Were you aware that it might have
some danger for you personally?

1595
02:08:14,700 --> 02:08:16,740
Yes, I was aware of it.

1596
02:08:16,860 --> 02:08:21,060
But how can you discard a friendship
from day to day because of some...

1597
02:08:21,180 --> 02:08:26,300
That is another question, Mrs Wallner.
I did not ask you that question.

1598
02:08:26,420 --> 02:08:30,060
- Were you aware of it?
- Yes, I was aware.

1599
02:08:30,180 --> 02:08:32,740
Yet you still continued to see each other?

1600
02:08:32,860 --> 02:08:34,820
Yes.

1601
02:08:36,060 --> 02:08:41,100
It was brought out that Mr Feldenstein
bought you candy and cigarettes.

1602
02:08:41,220 --> 02:08:42,180
Yes.

1603
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:45,340
Remember that sometimes
he bought you flowers?

1604
02:08:45,460 --> 02:08:48,340
Yes, he bought me many things.

1605
02:08:48,460 --> 02:08:50,500
That was because he was kind.

1606
02:08:51,420 --> 02:08:54,380
He was the kindest man I ever knew.

1607
02:08:56,860 --> 02:08:59,980
Do you know the witness,
Mrs Elsa Lindnow?

1608
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:01,540
Yes, I know her.

1609
02:09:01,660 --> 02:09:04,740
- Was she a cleaner at your apartment?
- Yes.

1610
02:09:04,860 --> 02:09:07,780
Did Mr Feldenstein come
to see you at your apartment?

1611
02:09:07,900 --> 02:09:10,460
- Yes.
- How many times?

1612
02:09:11,940 --> 02:09:14,500
I don't remember.

1613
02:09:14,620 --> 02:09:17,380
- Several times?
- Yes.

1614
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:20,060
- Many times?
- Many times.

1615
02:09:20,180 --> 02:09:22,660
- Did you kiss him?
- Yes, I kissed him.

1616
02:09:22,780 --> 02:09:25,700
Was there more than one kiss?

1617
02:09:25,820 --> 02:09:28,180
Yes.

1618
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:32,980
But it was not in the way
you are trying to make it sound.

1619
02:09:33,100 --> 02:09:38,020
He was like a father to me.
He was more than a father.

1620
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:40,980
More than a father?!
Did you sit on his lap?

1621
02:09:41,100 --> 02:09:43,820
Objection!
Counsel is persecuting the witness

1622
02:09:43,940 --> 02:09:45,900
in the pretext of gaining testimony.

1623
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:48,700
Objection overruled.

1624
02:09:48,820 --> 02:09:53,700
The defence is re-enacting what was
a travesty of justice in the first place.

1625
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:59,100
Colonel Lawson, the tribunal makes the
rulings in this case, not the prosecution.

1626
02:09:59,220 --> 02:10:01,660
- You may proceed.
- Did you sit on his lap?

1627
02:10:02,540 --> 02:10:08,500
Yes. But there was nothing
wrong or ugly about it.

1628
02:10:08,620 --> 02:10:11,060
Did you sit on his lap?

1629
02:10:11,180 --> 02:10:12,700
Yes. But...

1630
02:10:12,820 --> 02:10:15,340
You sat on his lap!
What else did you do?

1631
02:10:17,300 --> 02:10:21,180
There was nothing that you are
trying to say, nothing like that.

1632
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:24,060
What else did you do, Mrs Wallner?

1633
02:10:24,740 --> 02:10:26,780
<i>What are you trying to do?</i>

1634
02:10:28,460 --> 02:10:30,420
Are you trying to...

1635
02:10:32,700 --> 02:10:36,900
Why do you not let me speak the truth?

1636
02:10:37,020 --> 02:10:40,540
That's what we want, Mrs Wallner,
the truth. The truth!

1637
02:10:40,660 --> 02:10:42,820
You admitted that
you continued to see him.

1638
02:10:42,940 --> 02:10:45,380
You admitted that
he came to your apartment.

1639
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:48,940
You admitted you kissed him.
You admitted you sat on his lap.

1640
02:10:49,060 --> 02:10:51,380
What else do you admit to? What else?

1641
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:56,260
Nothing! There was nothing
like you're trying to make it sound.

1642
02:10:56,380 --> 02:11:01,100
- What else?
- There was nothing! Nothing.

1643
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:03,060
Stop it!

1644
02:11:03,180 --> 02:11:04,260
<i>- (stamps feet)
- Stop it!</i>

1645
02:11:04,380 --> 02:11:06,660
What else do you admit to, Mrs Wallner?

1646
02:11:06,780 --> 02:11:08,740
Herr Rolfe!

1647
02:11:12,820 --> 02:11:14,780
Are we going to do this again?

1648
02:11:20,140 --> 02:11:25,940
Your Honour, the defendant has been
under such stress that he is not aware...

1649
02:11:26,060 --> 02:11:29,620
I am aware. I am aware.

1650
02:11:29,740 --> 02:11:32,180
Your Honour, the defendant
wishes to make a statement.

1651
02:11:32,300 --> 02:11:35,780
- I believe the defence has a right to...
- Order, order.

1652
02:11:35,900 --> 02:11:37,860
<i>- Order!
- (bangs gavel)</i>

1653
02:11:40,940 --> 02:11:43,740
Does the defendant
wish to make a statement?

1654
02:11:43,860 --> 02:11:46,980
I wish to make a statement, yes.

1655
02:11:47,860 --> 02:11:50,500
Your Honour, the defence
has the right to request...

1656
02:11:50,620 --> 02:11:53,500
The defendant has the right
to make his statement now.

1657
02:11:53,620 --> 02:11:58,620
- I have to speak with my client.
- He has the right to make it now!

1658
02:12:00,380 --> 02:12:01,700
<i>(sobbing)</i>

1659
02:12:08,100 --> 02:12:11,180
Tribunal is adjourned
until 10.30 tomorrow morning.

1660
02:12:15,860 --> 02:12:18,300
<i>(Rolfe) What are you doing?</i>

1661
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:21,540
What do you think you're trying to do?

1662
02:12:21,660 --> 02:12:26,380
They've had Göring, Frank, Streicher...
That's over.

1663
02:12:27,140 --> 02:12:31,620
Do you think I have enjoyed being
defence counsel during this trial?

1664
02:12:31,740 --> 02:12:35,300
There were things I had to do
in that courtroom that made me cringe.

1665
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:37,540
Why did I do them?

1666
02:12:37,660 --> 02:12:40,500
Because I want to leave
the German people something.

1667
02:12:40,620 --> 02:12:42,900
I want to leave them a shred of dignity.

1668
02:12:43,020 --> 02:12:45,660
I want to call a halt to these proceedings.

1669
02:12:45,780 --> 02:12:48,780
If we allow them to discredit
every German like you,

1670
02:12:48,900 --> 02:12:52,540
we lose the right to rule ourselves forever!

1671
02:12:53,100 --> 02:12:56,540
We have to look at the future.
We can't look back now.

1672
02:12:56,660 --> 02:12:59,460
Do you want the Americans
to stay here forever?

1673
02:12:59,580 --> 02:13:03,220
I could show you a picture
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

1674
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:05,740
Thousands and thousands
of burnt bodies.

1675
02:13:05,860 --> 02:13:07,820
Women and children.

1676
02:13:08,820 --> 02:13:12,020
Is that their superior morality?

1677
02:13:12,140 --> 02:13:14,420
Where do you think they take us?
Do they know?

1678
02:13:14,540 --> 02:13:18,700
Do you think they have
any concept of our problems?

1679
02:13:22,540 --> 02:13:24,580
What can I say to you?

1680
02:13:25,940 --> 02:13:28,860
What can I say to you to make you see?

1681
02:13:35,220 --> 02:13:38,220
There is nothing you can say.

1682
02:13:39,940 --> 02:13:40,900
Nothing.

1683
02:13:41,020 --> 02:13:44,100
<i>(radio) Nothing has happened
to alleviate the crisis.</i>

1684
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:46,220
<i>The crisis reached a head this afternoon</i>

1685
02:13:46,340 --> 02:13:49,740
<i>when all rail travel between
western zones and Berlin was stopped.</i>

1686
02:13:49,860 --> 02:13:52,900
<i>The blockade by land is now complete.</i>

1687
02:13:54,020 --> 02:13:56,180
<i>(music starts)</i>

1688
02:13:59,260 --> 02:14:02,820
What do you think we're going
to do, General? Withdraw?

1689
02:14:02,940 --> 02:14:05,460
We can't. If we withdraw under pressure,

1690
02:14:05,580 --> 02:14:07,900
our prestige all over
the world is threatened.

1691
02:14:08,020 --> 02:14:10,300
The Communists
will move in on every front.

1692
02:14:10,420 --> 02:14:15,660
What about these trials, General?
How do you feel about them now?

1693
02:14:15,780 --> 02:14:18,060
We're committed to the trials,

1694
02:14:18,180 --> 02:14:21,900
but I think it would be realistic
to accelerate them as much as possible.

1695
02:14:22,020 --> 02:14:25,460
What would happen if they fired
on one of our planes, General?

1696
02:14:25,580 --> 02:14:29,900
We'll have to face that when it happens.
There is no other answer to that now.

1697
02:14:33,180 --> 02:14:35,740
You should try the strudel.
It's excellent here.

1698
02:14:35,860 --> 02:14:37,780
No, thanks.

1699
02:14:37,900 --> 02:14:41,860
Dan, I've just come back
from Berlin, as you know.

1700
02:14:41,980 --> 02:14:46,220
I don't think this is going to be it.
A lot of people do, but I don't.

1701
02:14:46,340 --> 02:14:51,980
But it is going to be a fight for survival -
for the next ten years, maybe the next 20.

1702
02:14:52,100 --> 02:14:54,340
Germany is the key to that survival.

1703
02:14:54,460 --> 02:14:58,860
Any high-school student
in geography can tell you that.

1704
02:14:58,980 --> 02:15:01,660
Just what are you trying to say, Senator?

1705
02:15:01,780 --> 02:15:04,100
What I'm trying to say is this:

1706
02:15:04,220 --> 02:15:07,740
While nobody's trying
to influence your decision,

1707
02:15:07,860 --> 02:15:11,700
it's important that you realise this
because it's a fact of life.

1708
02:15:11,820 --> 02:15:16,140
Let's face it, gentlemen,
the handwriting is on the wall.

1709
02:15:16,260 --> 02:15:18,620
We're going to need
all the help we can get.

1710
02:15:18,740 --> 02:15:23,060
We're going to need
the support of the German people.

1711
02:15:23,180 --> 02:15:25,340
More strudel, gentlemen?

1712
02:15:29,380 --> 02:15:31,740
Herr Janning, you may proceed.

1713
02:15:36,580 --> 02:15:40,340
I wish to testify
about the Feldenstein case

1714
02:15:41,500 --> 02:15:46,460
because it was the most significant
trial of the period.

1715
02:15:46,580 --> 02:15:51,660
It is important not only
for the tribunal to understand it,

1716
02:15:51,780 --> 02:15:54,420
but for the whole German people.

1717
02:15:55,260 --> 02:15:57,700
But in order to understand it,

1718
02:15:57,900 --> 02:16:02,260
one must understand
the period in which it happened.

1719
02:16:03,260 --> 02:16:05,860
There was a fever over the land.

1720
02:16:05,980 --> 02:16:10,380
A fever of disgrace,
of indignity, of hunger.

1721
02:16:11,500 --> 02:16:13,980
We had a democracy, yes,

1722
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:16,940
but it was torn by elements within.

1723
02:16:17,540 --> 02:16:21,020
Above all, there was fear.

1724
02:16:21,140 --> 02:16:24,700
Fear of today, fear of tomorrow,

1725
02:16:24,820 --> 02:16:26,820
fear of our neighbours,

1726
02:16:26,940 --> 02:16:29,660
and fear of ourselves.

1727
02:16:30,980 --> 02:16:33,380
Only when you understand that

1728
02:16:33,500 --> 02:16:36,780
can you understand
what Hitler meant to us.

1729
02:16:36,900 --> 02:16:38,860
Because he said to us:

1730
02:16:40,180 --> 02:16:44,300
"Lift your heads.
Be proud to be German."

1731
02:16:44,420 --> 02:16:49,220
"There are devils among us -
communists, liberals, Jews, Gypsies."

1732
02:16:49,340 --> 02:16:55,380
"Once these devils will be destroyed,
your misery will be destroyed."

1733
02:16:55,500 --> 02:17:00,260
It was the old, old story
of the sacrificial lamb.

1734
02:17:04,140 --> 02:17:06,460
What about those of us who knew better?

1735
02:17:06,580 --> 02:17:10,700
We who knew the words were lies
and worse than lies?

1736
02:17:10,820 --> 02:17:14,740
Why did we sit silent?
Why did we take part?

1737
02:17:16,220 --> 02:17:18,660
Because we loved our country.

1738
02:17:19,820 --> 02:17:24,820
What difference does it make if a few
political extremists lose their rights?

1739
02:17:24,940 --> 02:17:29,300
What difference does it make if a few
racial minorities lose their rights?

1740
02:17:29,420 --> 02:17:31,420
It is only a passing phase.

1741
02:17:31,540 --> 02:17:33,820
It is only a stage we are going through.

1742
02:17:33,940 --> 02:17:36,100
It will be discarded sooner or later.

1743
02:17:36,220 --> 02:17:40,380
Hitler himself will be discarded
sooner or later.

1744
02:17:40,580 --> 02:17:43,660
"The country is in danger!
We will march out of the shadows."

1745
02:17:43,780 --> 02:17:48,340
"We will go forward."
"Forward" is the great password.

1746
02:17:51,020 --> 02:17:55,540
And history tells
how well we succeeded, Your Honour.

1747
02:17:56,820 --> 02:18:00,100
We succeeded beyond
our wildest dreams.

1748
02:18:00,220 --> 02:18:05,420
The very elements of hate and power
about Hitler that mesmerised Germany,

1749
02:18:05,540 --> 02:18:07,660
mesmerised the world!

1750
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:11,220
We found ourselves
with sudden powerful allies.

1751
02:18:11,340 --> 02:18:16,540
Things that had been denied to us
as a democracy were open to us now.

1752
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:21,060
The world said
"Go ahead. Take it. Take it!"

1753
02:18:21,180 --> 02:18:24,900
"Take Sudetenland.
Take the Rhineland. Remilitarise it."

1754
02:18:25,020 --> 02:18:27,380
"Take all of Austria! Take it."

1755
02:18:30,460 --> 02:18:34,060
And then one day we looked around

1756
02:18:34,180 --> 02:18:37,660
and found that we were
in an even more terrible danger.

1757
02:18:37,780 --> 02:18:40,060
The ritual began in this courtroom,

1758
02:18:40,180 --> 02:18:44,540
swept over the land
like a raging, roaring disease!

1759
02:18:44,660 --> 02:18:48,100
What was going to be a passing phase

1760
02:18:49,700 --> 02:18:51,860
had become the way of life.

1761
02:18:57,180 --> 02:18:59,140
Your Honour,

1762
02:19:00,460 --> 02:19:05,340
I was content to sit silent
during this trial.

1763
02:19:06,580 --> 02:19:10,260
I was content to tend my roses.

1764
02:19:12,020 --> 02:19:17,300
I was even content
to let counsel try to save my name...

1765
02:19:19,060 --> 02:19:23,100
until I realised that in order to save it

1766
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:27,500
he would have to raise the spectre again.

1767
02:19:29,820 --> 02:19:31,860
You have seen him do it.

1768
02:19:31,980 --> 02:19:34,780
He has done it here in this courtroom.

1769
02:19:34,900 --> 02:19:39,620
He has suggested that the Third Reich
worked for the benefit of people.

1770
02:19:39,740 --> 02:19:44,980
He has suggested that we sterilised men
for the welfare of the country.

1771
02:19:45,100 --> 02:19:51,700
He suggested that perhaps the old Jew
did sleep with the 16-year-old girl after all.

1772
02:19:51,820 --> 02:19:58,500
Once more, it is being done
for love of country.

1773
02:20:01,020 --> 02:20:04,980
It is not easy to tell the truth.

1774
02:20:06,660 --> 02:20:10,660
But if there is to be
any salvation for Germany,

1775
02:20:10,780 --> 02:20:14,380
we who know our guilt must admit it,

1776
02:20:14,500 --> 02:20:19,180
whatever the pain and humiliation.

1777
02:20:24,700 --> 02:20:30,180
I had reached my verdict
on the Feldenstein case

1778
02:20:30,300 --> 02:20:32,740
before I ever came into the courtroom.

1779
02:20:32,860 --> 02:20:37,180
I would have found him guilty whatever
the evidence. It was not a trial at all.

1780
02:20:37,300 --> 02:20:42,060
It was a sacrificial ritual, and Feldenstein
the Jew was the helpless victim.

1781
02:20:42,180 --> 02:20:46,540
Your Honour, the defendant
is not aware of what he is saying.

1782
02:20:46,660 --> 02:20:48,620
He is not aware of the implications.

1783
02:20:48,740 --> 02:20:51,300
I am aware. I am aware!

1784
02:20:53,140 --> 02:20:55,500
My counsel would have you believe

1785
02:20:55,620 --> 02:20:59,540
we were not aware
of the concentration camps.

1786
02:20:59,660 --> 02:21:02,100
Not aware.

1787
02:21:02,220 --> 02:21:03,980
Where were we?

1788
02:21:04,100 --> 02:21:07,820
Where were we when Hitler began
shrieking his hate in the Reichstag?

1789
02:21:07,940 --> 02:21:12,140
When our neighbours were dragged out
in the middle of the night to Dachau?

1790
02:21:12,260 --> 02:21:15,500
Where were we when every village
in Germany has a railroad terminal

1791
02:21:15,620 --> 02:21:21,020
where cattle cars were filled with children
being carried off to their extermination?

1792
02:21:21,140 --> 02:21:24,100
Where were we when they cried out
in the night to us?

1793
02:21:24,220 --> 02:21:27,300
Were we deaf? Dumb? Blind?

1794
02:21:27,420 --> 02:21:29,260
Your Honour, I must protest.

1795
02:21:29,380 --> 02:21:34,740
My counsel says we were not aware
of the extermination of the millions.

1796
02:21:34,860 --> 02:21:37,060
He would give you the excuse

1797
02:21:37,180 --> 02:21:41,820
we were only aware
of the extermination of the hundreds.

1798
02:21:42,580 --> 02:21:45,620
Does that make us any the less guilty?

1799
02:21:46,980 --> 02:21:49,380
Maybe we didn't know the details,

1800
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:54,060
but if we didn't know,
it was because we didn't want to know.

1801
02:21:54,180 --> 02:21:58,100
- Traitor! Traitor!
- Order. Order.

1802
02:21:58,660 --> 02:22:00,540
Order!

1803
02:22:00,660 --> 02:22:03,820
Put that man back in his seat
and keep him there.

1804
02:22:07,740 --> 02:22:10,380
I am going to tell them the truth.

1805
02:22:11,260 --> 02:22:16,660
I am going to tell them the truth
if the whole world conspires against it.

1806
02:22:16,780 --> 02:22:22,140
I am going to tell them the truth
about their Ministry of Justice.

1807
02:22:23,660 --> 02:22:28,420
Werner Lampe, an old man
who cries into his Bible now.

1808
02:22:29,020 --> 02:22:31,940
An old man who profited
by the property expropriation

1809
02:22:32,060 --> 02:22:35,580
of every man he sent
to a concentration camp.

1810
02:22:35,700 --> 02:22:40,740
Friedrich Hofstetter, the good German,
who knew how to take orders,

1811
02:22:40,860 --> 02:22:45,900
who sent men before him to be sterilised,
like so many digits.

1812
02:22:47,940 --> 02:22:50,340
Emil Hahn,

1813
02:22:50,460 --> 02:22:53,380
the decayed, corrupt bigot,

1814
02:22:53,500 --> 02:22:56,540
obsessed by the evil within himself.

1815
02:23:01,540 --> 02:23:03,500
And Ernst Janning,

1816
02:23:05,460 --> 02:23:07,620
worse than any of them...

1817
02:23:08,420 --> 02:23:11,460
because he knew what they were,

1818
02:23:11,580 --> 02:23:13,820
and he went along with them.

1819
02:23:16,740 --> 02:23:20,660
Ernst Janning, who made his life...

1820
02:23:23,060 --> 02:23:25,020
excrement...

1821
02:23:26,740 --> 02:23:29,100
because he walked with them.

1822
02:24:51,860 --> 02:24:53,820
Your Honour,

1823
02:24:55,100 --> 02:24:59,700
it is my duty to defend Ernst Janning,

1824
02:25:00,740 --> 02:25:04,900
and yet Ernst Janning
has said he is guilty.

1825
02:25:05,020 --> 02:25:09,020
There is no doubt he feels his guilt.

1826
02:25:10,660 --> 02:25:15,100
He made a great error
in going along with the Nazi movement,

1827
02:25:15,700 --> 02:25:18,660
hoping it would be good for his country.

1828
02:25:18,780 --> 02:25:22,540
But, if he is to be found guilty,

1829
02:25:23,700 --> 02:25:27,780
there are others who also went along,

1830
02:25:28,820 --> 02:25:31,260
who also must be found guilty.

1831
02:25:32,980 --> 02:25:38,140
Ernst Janning said "We succeeded
beyond our wildest dreams".

1832
02:25:40,060 --> 02:25:43,500
Why did we succeed, Your Honour?

1833
02:25:45,180 --> 02:25:47,820
What about the rest of the world?

1834
02:25:49,260 --> 02:25:53,260
Did it not know
the intentions of the Third Reich?

1835
02:25:53,380 --> 02:25:58,060
Did it not hear the words of Hitler
broadcast all over the world?

1836
02:25:58,180 --> 02:26:00,500
<i>Did it not read his intentions
in Mein Kampf,</i>

1837
02:26:00,620 --> 02:26:03,700
published in every corner of the world?

1838
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:07,460
Where is the responsibility
of the Soviet Union,

1839
02:26:07,580 --> 02:26:13,420
who signed in 1939 the pact with Hitler
that enabled him to make war?

1840
02:26:14,660 --> 02:26:17,300
Are we now to find Russia guilty?

1841
02:26:18,500 --> 02:26:21,740
Where is the responsibility
of the Vatican,

1842
02:26:21,860 --> 02:26:25,180
who signed in 1933
the concordat with Hitler,

1843
02:26:25,300 --> 02:26:28,860
giving him his first tremendous prestige?

1844
02:26:29,580 --> 02:26:32,620
Are we now to find the Vatican guilty?

1845
02:26:33,900 --> 02:26:37,100
Where is the responsibility
of the world leader Winston Churchill,

1846
02:26:37,220 --> 02:26:40,860
<i>who said in an open letter
to the London Times in 1938 -</i>

1847
02:26:40,980 --> 02:26:44,380
1938, Your Honour -

1848
02:26:45,420 --> 02:26:48,660
"Were England to suffer national disaster,
I should pray to God

1849
02:26:48,780 --> 02:26:53,100
to send a man of the strength of mind
and will of an Adolf Hitler."

1850
02:26:53,220 --> 02:26:56,260
Are we now to find
Winston Churchill guilty?

1851
02:26:56,380 --> 02:26:59,580
Where is the responsibility
of those American industrialists

1852
02:26:59,700 --> 02:27:02,260
who helped Hitler
to rebuild his armaments,

1853
02:27:02,380 --> 02:27:05,540
and profited by that rebuilding?

1854
02:27:05,660 --> 02:27:08,700
Are we now to find
the American industrialists guilty?

1855
02:27:08,820 --> 02:27:11,220
No, Your Honour. No.

1856
02:27:12,260 --> 02:27:14,220
Germany alone is not guilty.

1857
02:27:14,340 --> 02:27:17,860
The whole world is as responsible
for Hitler as Germany.

1858
02:27:17,980 --> 02:27:20,780
It is an easy thing
to condemn one man in the dock.

1859
02:27:20,900 --> 02:27:24,500
It is easy to speak of
the "basic flaw" in the German character

1860
02:27:24,620 --> 02:27:26,580
that allowed Hitler to rise to power,

1861
02:27:26,700 --> 02:27:29,780
and at the same time
ignore the "basic flaw" of character

1862
02:27:29,900 --> 02:27:33,580
that made the Russians sign pacts
with him, Winston Churchill praise him,

1863
02:27:33,700 --> 02:27:37,060
American industrialists profit by him!

1864
02:27:39,860 --> 02:27:43,180
Ernst Janning said he is guilty.

1865
02:27:45,140 --> 02:27:50,860
If he is, Ernst Janning's guilt
is the world's guilt.

1866
02:27:52,740 --> 02:27:55,700
No more and no less.

1867
02:28:08,780 --> 02:28:14,060
Major, we have to give the military
governor every help we can give him.

1868
02:28:14,180 --> 02:28:17,220
We have to get 700 tons in the air a day.

1869
02:28:17,340 --> 02:28:19,300
700 tons.

1870
02:28:24,580 --> 02:28:26,540
This is some operation.

1871
02:28:28,780 --> 02:28:34,340
Did you ever think we'd be flying
coal and tomatoes in these crates?

1872
02:28:36,420 --> 02:28:39,940
Tad, you and I
have been friends a long time.

1873
02:28:40,060 --> 02:28:42,420
That's why I called you here.

1874
02:28:45,220 --> 02:28:48,900
What are you going to do
in court tomorrow?

1875
02:28:51,060 --> 02:28:53,580
You know damn well
what I'm going to do.

1876
02:28:54,100 --> 02:28:59,100
I know what you want to do - put them
behind bars and throw away the key.

1877
02:28:59,220 --> 02:29:01,980
You know what's going on here now?

1878
02:29:03,140 --> 02:29:06,660
Yeah, I know what's going on.

1879
02:29:06,780 --> 02:29:09,380
You're an army man.
You know what we're up against.

1880
02:29:09,500 --> 02:29:13,180
The others may not, but you do.
I'll tell you the truth.

1881
02:29:13,300 --> 02:29:17,820
I don't know what's going to happen
if they fire on one of those planes.

1882
02:29:17,940 --> 02:29:20,340
I don't know what's going to happen.

1883
02:29:20,460 --> 02:29:24,860
But if I do know this:
If Berlin goes, Germany goes.

1884
02:29:24,980 --> 02:29:28,220
If Germany goes, Europe goes.

1885
02:29:29,020 --> 02:29:33,420
That's the way things stand.
That's the way they stand.

1886
02:29:33,540 --> 02:29:36,900
Look, Matt. I'm going to go the limit.

1887
02:29:37,020 --> 02:29:40,220
And not you, not the Pentagon,
not God on his throne is...

1888
02:29:40,340 --> 02:29:43,180
Who do you think you're talking to?

1889
02:29:44,580 --> 02:29:47,260
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

1890
02:29:47,380 --> 02:29:50,260
When you were marching into Dachau,
I was there too.

1891
02:29:50,380 --> 02:29:52,780
You think I'll ever forget it?

1892
02:29:53,780 --> 02:29:57,740
I'm not your commanding officer.
I can't and won't influence your decision.

1893
02:29:57,860 --> 02:30:02,340
But I want to give this to you,
and I want to give it to you straight.

1894
02:30:02,460 --> 02:30:05,500
We need the help of the German people.

1895
02:30:07,340 --> 02:30:13,260
You don't get their help by sentencing
their leaders to stiff prison sentences.

1896
02:30:23,900 --> 02:30:28,060
Tad, the thing to do is survive, isn't it?

1897
02:30:29,060 --> 02:30:33,100
Survive as best we can, but survive.

1898
02:30:42,460 --> 02:30:44,580
Just for laughs, Matt.

1899
02:30:45,500 --> 02:30:48,020
What was the war all about?

1900
02:30:49,580 --> 02:30:51,540
What was it about?

1901
02:30:57,460 --> 02:31:01,540
That concludes presentation
of documentary evidence

1902
02:31:01,660 --> 02:31:03,900
against these defendants.

1903
02:31:12,340 --> 02:31:14,300
Your Honours,

1904
02:31:15,340 --> 02:31:19,380
during the three years that have passed
since the end of the war in Europe,

1905
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:24,300
mankind has not crossed
over into Jordan.

1906
02:31:25,180 --> 02:31:28,540
In our own country,
fear of war has been revived

1907
02:31:28,660 --> 02:31:32,100
and we must look once more
to our defences.

1908
02:31:32,980 --> 02:31:38,020
There's talk of cold war
while men and women die in real wars,

1909
02:31:38,860 --> 02:31:46,540
and the echoes of persecution
and atrocities will not be stilled.

1910
02:31:49,060 --> 02:31:55,260
These events cannot help but colour
what happens in this courtroom.

1911
02:31:55,380 --> 02:31:58,940
But somewhere
in the midst of these events,

1912
02:31:59,860 --> 02:32:06,220
the responsibility for the crimes
that we brought forward during this trial

1913
02:32:06,340 --> 02:32:10,620
must be placed in true perspective.

1914
02:32:10,740 --> 02:32:16,740
And this is the decision
that faces Your Honours.

1915
02:32:16,860 --> 02:32:19,660
It is the dilemma of our times.

1916
02:32:21,900 --> 02:32:27,420
It is a dilemma that rests with you.

1917
02:32:33,860 --> 02:32:35,820
The prosecution rests.

1918
02:32:56,340 --> 02:33:00,220
The defendants may now
make their final statements.

1919
02:33:04,460 --> 02:33:08,300
Defendant Emil Hahn
may address the tribunal.

1920
02:33:13,100 --> 02:33:18,140
Your Honours, I do not evade
the responsibility for my actions.

1921
02:33:18,940 --> 02:33:23,580
On the contrary, I stand by them
before the entire world.

1922
02:33:24,420 --> 02:33:27,860
But I will not follow
the policy of others.

1923
02:33:28,660 --> 02:33:31,220
I will not say of our policy today
that it was wrong

1924
02:33:31,340 --> 02:33:34,540
when yesterday I say it was right.

1925
02:33:34,660 --> 02:33:37,260
Germany was fighting for its life.

1926
02:33:37,380 --> 02:33:40,460
Certain measures were needed
to protect it from its enemies.

1927
02:33:40,580 --> 02:33:43,580
I cannot say that I am sorry
we applied those measures.

1928
02:33:44,180 --> 02:33:46,900
We were a bulwark against Bolshevism.

1929
02:33:47,020 --> 02:33:50,540
We were a pillar of Western culture.

1930
02:33:50,980 --> 02:33:55,260
A bulwark and a pillar
the West may yet wish to retain.

1931
02:33:59,420 --> 02:34:04,780
The defendant Friedrich Hofstetter
may address the tribunal.

1932
02:34:10,780 --> 02:34:14,500
I have served my country
throughout my life,

1933
02:34:14,620 --> 02:34:17,060
and in whatever position
I was assigned to,

1934
02:34:17,180 --> 02:34:21,740
in faithfulness, with a pure heart
and without malice.

1935
02:34:22,660 --> 02:34:27,700
I followed the concept that I believed
to be the highest in my profession,

1936
02:34:27,820 --> 02:34:29,820
the concept that says:

1937
02:34:29,940 --> 02:34:35,980
To sacrifice one's own sense of justice
to the authoritative legal order,

1938
02:34:36,100 --> 02:34:38,740
to ask only what the law is,

1939
02:34:39,580 --> 02:34:42,500
and not to ask whether or not
it is also justice.

1940
02:34:43,420 --> 02:34:47,140
As a judge, I could do no other.

1941
02:34:47,260 --> 02:34:51,380
I believe Your Honours will find me,
and millions of Germans like me,

1942
02:34:51,500 --> 02:34:54,540
who believed they were doing
their duty to their country,

1943
02:34:54,660 --> 02:34:57,700
to be not guilty.

1944
02:35:02,500 --> 02:35:05,660
The defendant Werner Lampe
may address the tribunal.

1945
02:35:13,420 --> 02:35:15,380
Your Honours...

1946
02:35:26,140 --> 02:35:28,100
Your Honours...

1947
02:35:45,780 --> 02:35:48,900
The defendant Ernst Janning
may address the tribunal.

1948
02:35:58,820 --> 02:36:02,060
I have nothing to add to what I have said.

1949
02:36:12,420 --> 02:36:15,820
Testimony has been received,
final arguments have been heard.

1950
02:36:15,940 --> 02:36:21,460
There remains nothing now but the task
of the tribunal to render its decision.

1951
02:36:21,580 --> 02:36:25,460
The tribunal will recess
until further notification.

1952
02:36:45,740 --> 02:36:48,020
I've collected precedents and arguments

1953
02:36:48,140 --> 02:36:50,380
that have a bearing
on the basis of the case,

1954
02:36:50,500 --> 02:36:54,420
which is the conflict between
allegiance to international law

1955
02:36:54,540 --> 02:36:57,420
and to the laws of one's own country.

1956
02:36:57,540 --> 02:37:01,860
Dan, we have a mountain
of material to go over here.

1957
02:37:01,980 --> 02:37:04,100
- What are you looking at, Dan?
- Mm?

1958
02:37:04,220 --> 02:37:09,580
I was looking at some of these pictures
attached to the warrants for arrest.

1959
02:37:09,700 --> 02:37:11,660
What pictures?

1960
02:37:12,860 --> 02:37:16,540
There's Petersen
before they operated on him.

1961
02:37:16,660 --> 02:37:18,580
Here's Irene Hoffman.

1962
02:37:18,700 --> 02:37:21,540
She really was 16 once, wasn't she?

1963
02:37:22,860 --> 02:37:24,820
Feldenstein.

1964
02:37:26,860 --> 02:37:31,580
And here's a boy - he certainly
couldn't have been more than 14 -

1965
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:34,660
executed for saying things
against the Third Reich.

1966
02:37:34,780 --> 02:37:38,340
"By order of
Justice Friedrich Hofstetter."

1967
02:37:38,460 --> 02:37:42,700
If I may say so, more pertinent
to the legal basis of the case,

1968
02:37:42,820 --> 02:37:45,100
I have the address
of the French prosecutor

1969
02:37:45,220 --> 02:37:47,740
before the international military tribunal.

1970
02:37:47,860 --> 02:37:51,300
"It is obvious that, in the state
organised along modern lines,

1971
02:37:51,420 --> 02:37:55,620
responsibility is confined
to those who act directly for the state."

1972
02:37:55,740 --> 02:37:59,500
"Since they alone are in a position to
judge the legitimacy of the given orders,

1973
02:37:59,620 --> 02:38:01,980
they alone can be prosecuted."

1974
02:38:02,100 --> 02:38:04,620
I have another from Professor Jahreiss -

1975
02:38:04,740 --> 02:38:08,100
"Legal aspects:
Trial of the major war criminals".

1976
02:38:08,220 --> 02:38:11,300
On the basis of these,
I don't see where the prosecution

1977
02:38:11,420 --> 02:38:14,420
has put forth a really clear-cut case
against the defence

1978
02:38:14,540 --> 02:38:16,940
pertaining to the charges
in the indictment.

1979
02:38:17,060 --> 02:38:21,020
Regardless of the acts committed,
we cannot make the interpretation

1980
02:38:21,140 --> 02:38:27,500
that these defendants are really
responsible for crimes against humanity.

1981
02:38:28,260 --> 02:38:31,620
- What do you think, Dan?
- We've been going over this all day!

1982
02:38:31,740 --> 02:38:33,700
If it isn't clear now...

1983
02:38:35,100 --> 02:38:38,020
Aren't you going to look
at these precedents?

1984
02:38:38,140 --> 02:38:40,580
Aren't you interested at all?

1985
02:38:42,500 --> 02:38:47,380
I'm interested, Curtiss. You were
speaking of crimes against humanity,

1986
02:38:47,500 --> 02:38:50,700
saying the defendants
were not responsible for their acts.

1987
02:38:50,820 --> 02:38:53,740
I'd like you to explain that to me.

1988
02:38:53,860 --> 02:38:56,740
- I've just been explaining it.
- Maybe.

1989
02:38:56,860 --> 02:39:02,060
But all I've heard is a lot of legalistic
double talk and rationalisation.

1990
02:39:02,180 --> 02:39:05,620
You know, when I first became a judge

1991
02:39:05,740 --> 02:39:09,300
I knew there were certain people
in town I wasn't supposed to touch.

1992
02:39:09,420 --> 02:39:13,380
I knew that if I was to remain a judge,
this was so.

1993
02:39:14,340 --> 02:39:17,180
But how in God's name
do you expect me to look the other way

1994
02:39:17,300 --> 02:39:19,060
at the murder of six million people?

1995
02:39:19,180 --> 02:39:22,580
- I'm sure he didn't mean...
- I'm not asking you to look the other way.

1996
02:39:22,700 --> 02:39:26,860
I'm asking you what good
is it going to do to pursue this policy?

1997
02:39:29,380 --> 02:39:33,700
Curtiss, you were saying that the men
are not responsible for their acts.

1998
02:39:33,820 --> 02:39:35,980
You're going to have
to explain that to me.

1999
02:39:36,100 --> 02:39:38,940
You're going to have
to explain it very carefully.

2000
02:39:46,260 --> 02:39:48,100
The tribunal is now in session.

2001
02:39:48,220 --> 02:39:53,980
God bless the United States of America
and this honourable tribunal.

2002
02:40:12,180 --> 02:40:15,420
The trial conducted before this tribunal
began over eight months ago.

2003
02:40:15,540 --> 02:40:19,540
The record of evidence
is more than 10,000 pages long,

2004
02:40:19,660 --> 02:40:24,020
and final arguments
of counsel have been concluded.

2005
02:40:25,500 --> 02:40:28,620
Simple murders and atrocities

2006
02:40:28,740 --> 02:40:33,220
do not constitute the gravamen
of the charges in this indictment.

2007
02:40:33,340 --> 02:40:38,460
Rather, the charge
is that of conscious participation

2008
02:40:38,580 --> 02:40:44,140
in a nationwide, government-organised
system of cruelty and injustice,

2009
02:40:44,940 --> 02:40:51,420
in violation of every moral and legal
principle known to all civilised nations.

2010
02:40:52,340 --> 02:40:56,380
The tribunal has carefully
studied the record

2011
02:40:56,500 --> 02:41:00,820
and found therein abundant evidence

2012
02:41:00,940 --> 02:41:07,100
to support beyond a reasonable doubt
the charges against these defendants.

2013
02:41:07,220 --> 02:41:09,180
<i>(murmuring)</i>

2014
02:41:18,020 --> 02:41:22,700
Herr Rolfe, in his very skilful defence,

2015
02:41:23,340 --> 02:41:28,100
has asserted that there are others

2016
02:41:28,220 --> 02:41:31,020
who must share
the ultimate responsibility

2017
02:41:31,140 --> 02:41:33,580
for what happened here in Germany.

2018
02:41:33,700 --> 02:41:35,660
There is truth in this.

2019
02:41:36,780 --> 02:41:42,780
The real complaining party at the bar
in this courtroom is civilisation.

2020
02:41:44,300 --> 02:41:49,060
But the tribunal does say
that the men in the dock

2021
02:41:49,180 --> 02:41:52,140
are responsible for their actions.

2022
02:41:53,900 --> 02:41:57,420
Men who sat in black robes,

2023
02:41:58,860 --> 02:42:01,620
in judgment on other men.

2024
02:42:03,740 --> 02:42:09,980
Men who took part
in the enactment of laws and decrees,

2025
02:42:12,820 --> 02:42:16,860
the purpose of which was
the extermination of human beings.

2026
02:42:16,980 --> 02:42:19,940
Men who, in executive positions,

2027
02:42:20,060 --> 02:42:24,940
actively participated
in the enforcement of these laws,

2028
02:42:25,060 --> 02:42:28,140
illegal even under German law.

2029
02:42:34,140 --> 02:42:40,860
The principle of criminal law
in every civilised society

2030
02:42:40,980 --> 02:42:43,220
has this in common:

2031
02:42:44,660 --> 02:42:49,780
Any person who sways
another to commit murder,

2032
02:42:51,220 --> 02:42:57,380
any person who furnishes the lethal
weapon for the purpose of the crime,

2033
02:42:58,580 --> 02:43:02,140
any person who is
an accessory to the crime,

2034
02:43:03,820 --> 02:43:05,780
is guilty.

2035
02:43:09,820 --> 02:43:15,740
Herr Rolfe further asserts
that the defendant Janning

2036
02:43:17,540 --> 02:43:19,660
was an extraordinary jurist

2037
02:43:19,780 --> 02:43:23,100
and acted in what he thought
was the best interest of his country.

2038
02:43:23,220 --> 02:43:25,460
There is truth in this also.

2039
02:43:27,420 --> 02:43:31,780
Janning, to be sure, is a tragic figure.

2040
02:43:32,340 --> 02:43:35,780
We believe he loathed the evil he did.

2041
02:43:35,900 --> 02:43:39,140
But compassion for
the present torture of his soul

2042
02:43:39,260 --> 02:43:41,460
must not beget forgetfulness

2043
02:43:41,580 --> 02:43:47,780
of the torture and the death of millions
by the government of which he was part.

2044
02:43:47,900 --> 02:43:51,700
Janning's record and his fate
illuminate the most shattering truth

2045
02:43:51,820 --> 02:43:54,020
that has emerged from this trial.

2046
02:43:54,140 --> 02:43:59,260
If he, and all of the other defendants,
had been degraded perverts,

2047
02:43:59,380 --> 02:44:05,420
if all of the leaders of the Third Reich
had been sadistic monsters and maniacs,

2048
02:44:05,540 --> 02:44:09,460
then these events would have
no more moral significance

2049
02:44:09,580 --> 02:44:13,020
than an earthquake,
or any other natural catastrophe.

2050
02:44:13,140 --> 02:44:19,020
But this trial has shown
that under a national crisis

2051
02:44:19,140 --> 02:44:23,780
ordinary, even able
and extraordinary men,

2052
02:44:23,900 --> 02:44:27,660
can delude themselves
into the commission of crimes

2053
02:44:27,780 --> 02:44:30,940
so vast and heinous
that they beggar the imagination.

2054
02:44:31,060 --> 02:44:34,180
No one who has sat through
the trial can ever forget them.

2055
02:44:35,540 --> 02:44:39,020
Men sterilised because of political belief.

2056
02:44:39,140 --> 02:44:42,300
A mockery made of friendship and faith.

2057
02:44:42,420 --> 02:44:44,380
The murder of children.

2058
02:44:45,540 --> 02:44:47,580
How easily it can happen.

2059
02:44:49,340 --> 02:44:51,420
There are those in our own country too

2060
02:44:51,540 --> 02:44:56,060
who today speak of the protection
of country, of survival.

2061
02:44:56,180 --> 02:44:59,380
A decision must be made
in the life of every nation.

2062
02:44:59,500 --> 02:45:03,420
At the very moment when the grasp
of the enemy is at its throat,

2063
02:45:03,540 --> 02:45:07,260
then it seems that the only way to survive
is to use the means of the enemy,

2064
02:45:07,380 --> 02:45:09,940
to rest survival upon what is expedient,

2065
02:45:10,060 --> 02:45:12,260
to look the other way.

2066
02:45:13,220 --> 02:45:19,020
Well, the answer to that is...
survival as what?

2067
02:45:19,140 --> 02:45:21,340
A country isn't a rock.

2068
02:45:21,460 --> 02:45:23,980
It's not an extension of one's self.

2069
02:45:24,100 --> 02:45:26,140
It's what it stands for.

2070
02:45:26,260 --> 02:45:32,420
It's what it stands for when standing
for something is the most difficult.

2071
02:45:34,460 --> 02:45:37,260
Before the people of the world,

2072
02:45:37,380 --> 02:45:44,060
let it now be noted that here,
in our decision, this is what we stand for:

2073
02:45:45,100 --> 02:45:47,660
Justice, truth...

2074
02:45:50,260 --> 02:45:53,300
and the value of a single human being.

2075
02:46:03,620 --> 02:46:07,100
The marshal will produce before
the tribunal the defendant Hahn.

2076
02:46:09,900 --> 02:46:11,940
Emil Hahn,

2077
02:46:12,060 --> 02:46:16,500
the tribunal finds you guilty
and sentences you to life imprisonment.

2078
02:46:16,620 --> 02:46:21,780
Today you sentence me.
Tomorrow the Bolsheviks sentence you!

2079
02:46:26,580 --> 02:46:33,060
The marshal will produce the defendant
Hofstetter before the tribunal.

2080
02:46:33,980 --> 02:46:35,940
Friedrich Hofstetter,

2081
02:46:36,060 --> 02:46:41,900
the tribunal finds you guilty
and sentences you to life imprisonment.

2082
02:46:44,740 --> 02:46:50,300
The marshal will produce
the defendant Lampe before the tribunal.

2083
02:46:54,540 --> 02:46:56,500
Werner Lampe,

2084
02:46:57,740 --> 02:47:03,580
the tribunal finds you guilty
and sentences you to life imprisonment.

2085

2087

The marshal will produce the defendant
Ernst Janning before the tribunal.

2088
02:47:31,900 --> 02:47:33,860
Ernst Janning,

2089
02:47:35,060 --> 02:47:40,420
the tribunal finds you guilty
and sentences you to life imprisonment.

2090
02:47:45,940 --> 02:47:47,900
He doesn't understand.

2091
02:47:49,020 --> 02:47:51,380
He just doesn't understand.

2092
02:47:52,060 --> 02:47:54,020
He understands.

2093
02:47:57,340 --> 02:47:59,300
<i>(strikes gavel)</i>

2094
02:48:06,980 --> 02:48:09,340
Justice Ives dissenting.

2095
02:48:11,500 --> 02:48:17,020
I wish to point out strongly my dissenting
vote from the decision of this tribunal

2096
02:48:17,140 --> 02:48:22,740
as stated by Justice Haywood,
and in which Justice Norris concurred.

2097
02:48:22,860 --> 02:48:25,700
The issue of the actions of the defendants,

2098
02:48:25,820 --> 02:48:29,820
who believed they were acting
in the best interests of their country,

2099
02:48:29,940 --> 02:48:35,020
is an issue that cannot
be decided in a courtroom alone.

2100
02:48:35,140 --> 02:48:38,260
It can only be decided objectively,

2101
02:48:38,380 --> 02:48:42,740
in years to come,
in the true perspective of history.

2102
02:48:49,500 --> 02:48:52,020
Where shall I put these books,
Your Honour?

2103
02:48:52,140 --> 02:48:55,180
Put them in the trunk, Mr Halbestadt.

2104
02:48:57,180 --> 02:49:01,340
Your Honour, here's something
for you to have on the plane.

2105
02:49:01,460 --> 02:49:06,060
Oh, no. If you give me any more food,
I won't have any room for anything else.

2106
02:49:06,180 --> 02:49:08,380
But it's strudel, the way you like it.

2107
02:49:08,500 --> 02:49:12,020
<i>- Thank you. Thank you for everything.
- Ja, ja.</i>

2108
02:49:12,140 --> 02:49:14,100
- I'll put it in the car.
- Thanks.

2109
02:49:14,220 --> 02:49:19,300
Tickets, passport, immunisation.
I'll have your boarding pass at the airport.

2110
02:49:19,420 --> 02:49:21,700
See you there no later than three o'clock.

2111
02:49:21,820 --> 02:49:24,540
Oh, and give my regards to Miss...
what was her name?

2112
02:49:24,660 --> 02:49:26,900
Scheffler. Elsa.

2113
02:49:27,020 --> 02:49:29,460
- That's one you owe me.
- What do you mean?

2114
02:49:29,580 --> 02:49:34,420
Americans aren't very popular
in Nuremberg this morning.

2115

2118
02:50:31,420 --> 02:50:34,500
- Good afternoon, Your Honour.
- Good afternoon.

2119
02:50:35,740 --> 02:50:40,180
I came here at the request
of my client, Ernst Janning.

2120
02:50:41,820 --> 02:50:44,340
He wishes to see you.

2121
02:50:44,460 --> 02:50:47,220
I'm just leaving for the airport.

2122
02:50:48,380 --> 02:50:51,820
He says it would
mean a great deal to him.

2123
02:50:57,900 --> 02:51:01,660
Have you heard about
the verdict in the IG Farben case?

2124
02:51:01,780 --> 02:51:06,060
Most of them were acquitted.
The others received light sentences.

2125
02:51:06,180 --> 02:51:10,260
- The verdict came in today.
- No, I hadn't heard.

2126
02:51:10,380 --> 02:51:12,820
I will make you a wager.

2127
02:51:12,940 --> 02:51:15,300
I don't make wagers.

2128
02:51:15,420 --> 02:51:17,100
A gentlemen's wager.

2129
02:51:18,420 --> 02:51:23,940
In five years, the men you sentenced
to life imprisonment will be free.

2130
02:51:26,860 --> 02:51:30,900
Herr Rolfe, I have admired your work
in the courtroom for many months.

2131
02:51:31,020 --> 02:51:35,060
You are particularly brilliant
in your use of logic.

2132
02:51:35,180 --> 02:51:40,140
So, what you suggest
may very well happen.

2133
02:51:40,260 --> 02:51:44,420
It is logical, in view
of the times in which we live.

2134
02:51:45,380 --> 02:51:48,500
But to be logical is not to be right.

2135
02:51:48,620 --> 02:51:51,780
And nothing on God's earth
could ever make it right.

2136
02:52:02,260 --> 02:52:04,220
Someone to see you.

2137
02:52:15,860 --> 02:52:17,820
Herr Janning.

2138
02:52:19,220 --> 02:52:21,180
Judge Haywood.

2139
02:52:22,860 --> 02:52:24,980
Please, sit down.

2140
02:52:25,700 --> 02:52:29,020
Thank you. You wanted to see me.

2141
02:52:29,140 --> 02:52:33,220
Yes. There is something
I want to give you.

2142
02:52:33,340 --> 02:52:35,300
A record.

2143
02:52:36,620 --> 02:52:40,380
A record of my cases,
the ones I remember.

2144
02:52:41,820 --> 02:52:45,660
I want to give them
to someone I can trust,

2145
02:52:45,780 --> 02:52:48,940
someone I felt I got to know
during the trial.

2146
02:52:55,180 --> 02:52:57,140
Thank you.

2147
02:52:59,140 --> 02:53:01,420
I'll take good care of them.

2148
02:53:01,540 --> 02:53:06,140
I know the pressures
that had been brought upon you.

2149
02:53:06,260 --> 02:53:08,540
You will be criticised greatly.

2150
02:53:08,660 --> 02:53:11,900
Your decision will not be a popular one.

2151
02:53:13,740 --> 02:53:16,860
But, if it means anything to you,

2152
02:53:16,980 --> 02:53:22,260
you have the respect
of at least one of the men you convicted.

2153
02:53:22,380 --> 02:53:27,900
By all that is right in this world,
your verdict was a just one.

2154
02:53:29,540 --> 02:53:31,500
Thank you.

2155
02:53:32,940 --> 02:53:37,100
What you said in the courtroom,
it needed to be said.

2156
02:53:37,220 --> 02:53:38,780
Judge Haywood...

2157
02:53:42,060 --> 02:53:44,260
The reason I asked you to come...

2158
02:53:51,700 --> 02:53:56,060
Those people, those millions of people,

2159
02:53:58,140 --> 02:54:01,380
I never knew it would come to that.

2160
02:54:01,500 --> 02:54:05,300
You must believe it.
You must believe it.

2161
02:54:08,420 --> 02:54:12,140
Herr Janning, it came to that

2162
02:54:12,260 --> 02:54:16,860
the first time you sentenced a man
to death you knew to be innocent.
