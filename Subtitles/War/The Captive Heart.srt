23
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,120
Yeah, I remember something better than beer, too.

24
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,200
That stunner! Ooh, she was a smasher.

25
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,880
I can see her hair now, blacker than coal.

26
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,320
And that savoury piece in Lille!

27
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,760
Ooh, boy! She taught me a thing or two.

28
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,680
Pity you kept it to yourself.

29
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,000
It's proud we should be married to a couple of Don Juans.

30
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,400
Don't believe a girl ever looked at him twice. Poor old dear.

31
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,240
- Steady, you looked twice, didn't you? 
- You caught me off me guard.

32
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,680
I was low following the flu.

33
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,560
Wonder what made you marry me.

34
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,480
You don't know? That wicked tenor voice you have.

35
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,160
- Leave them. Me and Ted will clear later. 
- Any more for any more?

36
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,360
- No, thank you. 
- It's nearly 12. We've got to be at the depot at 7am.

37
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,560
- Come on home. 
- We'll have 'em both back before you can turn round.

War will be over by Christmas? Where have I heard that before?

40
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,200
It's a shame we got to close the business.

41
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,200
It's just a habit we've got into, fighting the same war every 20 years.

42
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,560
- Nasty habit, too. 
- Good night, Flo.

43
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,040
Good night.

44
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,440
See you in the morning.

45
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,640
All right.

46
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,320
She's a proper worrier.

47
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,920
Shame she never had kids.

48
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,720
And her always wanting them so much.

49
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,600
They'd have took her mind off things.

50
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,840
Well, it's too late now, I suppose.

51
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,720
Are you sorry Glad and Mary are grown up?

52
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,800
Well, I am and I'm not, in a manner of speaking.

53
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,320
What about starting all over again, old girl?

54
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,080
No, thank you, Ted.

55
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,000

74
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,200
I had to come back.

75
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,640
Robert. What about him?

76
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,560
I wanted to tell you.

77
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,400

78
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,360
I think he understands.

79
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
I told him three weeks ago.

80
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,200
We met three weeks ago.

81
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,080

Ja, gut. Erklaren Sie, dass die Offiziere von den Mannschaften getrennt werden.

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,400
I suppose I can do that.

177
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,840
Oh, yes, certainly.

178
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,680
Flag 27. Prisoner of war number 1376.

179
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,160
Thank you.

180
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,760
Hello, Mummy!

181
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,600
Hello, darling. Have you had a lovely day with Grandpa?

182
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,520
Will Father ever come back to us, Grandpa,

183
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,440
even when the war's over?

184
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,360
Well, would you be glad if he did?

185
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,280
No. He used to make Mummy cry.

186
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,560
He is a prisoner.

187
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,680
- Hello, Desmond. 
- Hello, Mummy.

188
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,080
Janet, I'll leave you in charge.

189
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,760
Well?

190
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,680
He didn't put me down as next of kin.

191
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,760
Well, that seems to be the final gesture, doesn't it, my dear?

192
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,200
It was only logical, I suppose.

193
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,520
Poor Geoffrey.

194
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,040
Poor Geoffrey?

195
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,400
Well, I for one don't intend to shed any tears over him.

196
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,840
- Father? 
- Hmm?

197
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,760
I'm going to write to him.

198
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,200
- You are? 
- Yes.

199
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,120
Can't do any harm or good.

200
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,240
They must be glad of any news of home.

201
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,880
I don't suppose Geoffrey ever betrayed the faintest interest in his home.

202
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,240
I can tell him how the children are getting on.

203
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,120
I can see Geoffrey regaling his fellow prisoners

204
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,000
with news of the children he's scarcely ever seen.

205
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,920
You're afraid, aren't you, Father?

206
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,440
Certainly. I'm afraid that you may let yourself be carried away

207
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,680
by sentimentality and suggest patching things up with him.

208
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,240
Don't worry.

209
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,440
But we said so many hard, cruel things to each other.

210
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,360
I'd like to wipe out the memory of them.

211
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,760
And then if we should happen to meet when the war's over,

212
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,720
it won't be as enemies.

213
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,760
Here. Go easy with the soap.

214
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,240
Sorry, old boy.

215
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,120
We may make it last two days more if we're very careful.

216
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,000
After that, we've got to make do with godliness.

217
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,880
I say, Padre, what are you smoking? Sauerkraut?

218
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,760
Fag ends of fag ends of fag ends.

219
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,600
Lucky fellow. I'm down to Mr Middleton's specials.

220
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,160
Not a cough in a contest.

221
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,760
I hear there's a bush around here that's not too bad in a pipe.

222
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,360
Had a marvellous dream last night.

223
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,840
Anybody I know?

224
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,240
Eggs and bacon.

225
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,480
Tomato ketchup this time.

226
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,560
We must have lost a shocking lot of stuff.

227
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,960
There's nothing to stop 'em.

228
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,880
He's bound to invade before the end of summer, that's the end of us.

229
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,760
- Steady. What about the home fleet? 
- What about the Luftwaffe?!

230
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,200
Well, of all the damn defeatists!

231
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,080
- Well, if you prefer to be a ruddy halfwit. 
- What about the RAF?

232
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,720
Hitler can't stage an invasion

233
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,480
until he's got control of the air,

234
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,800
- and I don't see the boys handing him that on a plate. 
- Hear, hear!

235
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,080
You can't judge Hitler by ordinary standards.

236
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,800
If he thinks he'll invade, he'll invade.

237
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,360
My old woman makes the kids pay a penny a week for the Red Cross.

238
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,360
I'm writing to her to stop that caper.

239
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,000
Red ruddy Cross!

240
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,880
Bloody sausage we ever get out of it!

241
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,360
It's only two months.

242
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,160
Don't forget, there were only a few hundred prisoners here before.

243
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,600
Now there are tens of thousands.

244
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,880
It's a big job.

245
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,480
Yeah. Don't let's kid ourselves.

246
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,120
Nobody worries about us anymore.

247
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,880
We've been written off.

248
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,800
You're a pessimist.

249
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,360
How do you spell "sufficient"?

250
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,040
Same as the Sergeant Major's blessing, two "F"s and one "C".

251
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,480
Writing about the grub.

252
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,920
Muck, I call it.

253
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,640
Bit of the old woman's cooking is what I'd like now.

254
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,120
What a sucker I was joining the ruddy army.

255
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,080
Picturing meself cutting loose with some rowdy old French dames.

256
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,960
Here I am shut up in this place till I'll be past it.

257
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,840
You ought to have joined the Navy and let the world see you.

258
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,760
Now, son, there's no use you blowing off.

259
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,840
Take things as you find them, that's always been my motto.

260
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,080
The way I look at it is...

261
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,960
Hark at you! Drip, drip, drip. You're worse than a woman.

262
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,880
Knock it, sonny. I was swinging a rifle

263
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,360
when your nappies was on the line.

264
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,280
Swinging a lead, more like it.

265
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,600
Here, if you want a clip on the ear, my lad, you've come to the right person.

266
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,840
Ohh!

267
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,200
- That cigarette. Let me see it. 
- What do you mean see it?

268
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,880
It's a Player's. Where did you get it?

269
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,320
Saved it up. What's it to you?

270
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,000
- I had three Player's left. You stole it! 
- Ah, go chase yourself.

271
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,120
- Hand it over! 
- Pipe down, you little Welshman. 
- Give it back!

272
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,160
You did pinch that fag, you young basket.

273
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,600
Yes, I did. So what?

274
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,480
- Just this. 
- Ooh!

275
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,120
Been asking for it, sonny.

276
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,720
I'm a man of peace, and peace is what I'm going to have plenty of in here.

277
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,800
Blimey. They'll have to have you at the peace conference.

278
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,480
- How are you today, Jessup? 
- Mustn't grumble, sir.

279
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,840
- Manage to get any sleep? 
- Not so as you'd notice.

280
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,280
We'll soon get you out of here.

281
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,240
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

282
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,000
Morning, Lennox.

283
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,280
Oh, good morning, sir.

284
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,760
Got some good news for you, David.

285
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,160
Yes, Padre?

286
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,720
Yes, my lad. You'll be rejoining the rest of us tomorrow.

287
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,200
Oh, that's fine, sir.

288
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,560
And I'll be able to take this bandage off?

289
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,080
Not yet, I'm afraid.

290
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,040
You'll have to wait till the optic nerve is completely healthy again.

291
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,520
They'll send you to the eye hospital for an operation.

292
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,200
So you'll have to be a very patient patient, my boy.

293
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,120
I'll do my best, sir.

294
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,000
That's right.

295
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,720
I'm sorry, mate. I'll give you a packet of 20

296
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,640
when the Red Cross parcels come.

297
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,560
Losing my temper over a fag.

298
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,480
I shouldn't have left them loafing about.

299
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,000
You know, you wouldn't be a bad lad,

300
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,840
if you got rid of some of your nasty habits.

301
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,720
Nark it. Leave all that reforming stuff to the padre.

302
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,080
What's your job in Civvy Street?

303
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,520
Only suckers work.

304
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,920
- Oh, a wide boy, eh? 
- You bet.

305
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,320
Me and Ted's in the building business.

306
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,720
What about learning the trade when we get home?

307
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,640
I'll be home long before you two mugs.

308
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,080
I'm going to scarper.

309
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,000
You got out of tougher spots than this, eh?

310
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,920
- Sure. 
- Got a plan?

311
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,360
Dozens of 'em. For instance...

312
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,280
You know, I can't make up me mind

313
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,040
whether to turn this into a brigantine or a schooner.

314
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,480
GIRL GIGGLES

315
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,240
I wonder how Jane's getting on these days?

316
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,640
Who is Jane?

317
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,120
Your girl?

318
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,000
No, no, the Jane, the strip in the Mirror.

319
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,360
Oh, yes, the strip in the Mirror.

320
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,080
I suppose a highbrow like you wouldn't read the Daily Mirror.

321
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,760
Oh, I don't know. Why highbrow?

322
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,080
I mean, perfect German and all that sort of thing.

323
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,000
Spent much time in Germany?

324
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,360
Yes, as a matter of fact, I have.

325
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,240
Come to think of it, it's funny that

326
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,160
- none of the rest of your chaps got caught with you. 
- Yes.

327
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,760
Did you have a company?

328
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,040
Yes, machine gun company.

329
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,520
Machine gun company?!

330
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,840
You see, I...

331
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,280
I think I'll turn it up. Wound's hurting a bit.

332
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,840
All I have to do is stow away in one of them garbage bins or something, why, it's as easy as...

333
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,520
If you're planning an escape, Mathews,

334
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,160
may I give you a piece of advice?

335
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,080
Individual escapes hardly ever succeed.

336
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,600
These things have to be planned and coordinated by a whole group.

337
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,280
All the same, sir, I'm going to have a go at it if you have no objections.

338
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,240
Well, good luck to you.

339
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,600
Good luck. Two-faced bleeder.

340
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,880
I don't know what it is, but there's something phony about that bloke.

341
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,600
Always sucking up with the German MO or Commandant.

342
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,480
Look, men!

343
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,000
That settles it.

344
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,440
But they have machine gun companies in the German army.

345
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,920
- You seriously think he's a traitor? 
- He speaks German as well as any German.

346
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,320
Why shouldn't he be a German planted here as a stool pigeon?

347
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,880
- That would account for a lot of things. 
- We're always talking about home. He never does.

348
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,360
- I hate to believe it. 
- Come in.

349
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,480
May I report something, sir?

350
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,600
Go ahead.

351
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,360
Well, it's rather confidential, sir.

352
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,680
It's about somebody we think's a fifth columnist.

353
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,960
- An officer? 
- A matter of fact, sir, it is.

354
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,160
Captain Mitchell, sir.

355
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,800
- There you are. 
- He overheard me planning a breakout

356
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,680
- and went and talked to one of the German guards. 
- Thank you.

357
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,000
- Keep your mouth shut for the time being. 
- Very good, sir.

358
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,320
There's only one thing to do with a rat. String him up!

359
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,840
Here, wait a bit. Man's innocent till he's proved guilty.

360
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,760
Don't let us behave like a bunch of Nazis.

361
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,120
Come on.

362
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,040
Oh, Mitchell, you didn't destroy your identity card, did you?

363
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,120
No, why?

364
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,280
Oh, just check up. Have a look at it?

365
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,640
Do you mind duplicating your signature?

366
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,440
You can't do it, you swine, your name isn't Mitchell!

367
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,160
- Come on, what are we waiting for? Let's get it over with! 
- Stop it!

368
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,520
If you have anything to say, you better say it quick.

369
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,680
It's a long story, and...

370
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,440
..you wouldn't believe a word of it.

371
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,880
- You're dead right, we wouldn't! 
- Shut up! Go on, spill it.

372
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,680
I'm not a German. I'm a Czech.

373
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,160
A Czech in British uniform? That's bloody likely!

374
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,880
I'm in charge here. Shut up, and that's an order!

375
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,400
Come on.

376
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,520
I escaped from a German concentration camp.

377
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,800
I got through to France, and I took this uniform

378
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,200
and the identity card from Mitchell's dead body.

379
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,080
It was my only chance if the Germans caught up with me.

380
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,000
If that's the truth, why didn't you tell us?

381
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,880
Would you have believed me any more than you do now?

382
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,760
Besides, I have more to fear from the stool pigeons than you have.

383
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,360
You've no proof of your story.

384
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,160
None. How could I have?

385
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,760
How do you come to speak such perfect English and German?

386
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,120
My father was at the Czech embassy in London after the last war.

387
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,320
I spent my childhood there.

388
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,200
German is a sort of second language in Czechoslovakia.

389
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,560
I became professor of English at Prague University.

390
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,480
I'm not much of a soldier, I'm afraid.

391
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,920
What were you talking about to that guard just now?

392
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,760
Oh, I was trying to get a chess set for David Lennox.

393
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,160
- PA: 
- 'Achtung! Achtung!

394
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,480
'All British prisoners will parade at once.'

395
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,800
- You may get proof of my story after all. 
- How?

396
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,640
The civilian. His name's Forster.

397
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,160
- Gestapo. 
- How do you know?

398
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,080
He ran the concentration camp I was in.

399
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,640
You think he'll recognise you?

400
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,880
Well, if he does, he'll do your job for you.

401
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,160
- 'Achtung! Achtung!' 
- Come on.

402
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,720
'All British prisoners will parade at once.'

403
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,280
HE GREETS HIM IN GERMAN

404
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,200
Right turn!

405
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,800
Stand your men at ease, please.

406
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,160
Stand at ease!

407
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,160
Gentlemen, I present to you Herr Forster, the foreign office.

408
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,760
Gentlemen. For the time being, all communications

409
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,360
between Germany and England are at a standstill.

410
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,240
Your letters, therefore, cannot leave this country.

411
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,640
To keep you informed, however,

412
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,800
our news bulletins will be broadcast to you in English.

413
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,720
And as you cannot hope to receive news from home,

414
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,560
arrangements have been made for you

415
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,440
to broadcast messages to your next of kin.

416

417
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,360
Will all those who wish to avail themselves

418
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,080
of Herr Forster's offer, take three paces forward!

419
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,680
You are the senior British officer?

420
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,480
- Yes. 
- Are your men afraid that this is some sort of propaganda trick?

421
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,720
- Well, it's just possible. 
- As you wish.

422
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,320
Your name?

423
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,080
- Mitchell. 
- Mitchell?

424
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,400
You are the officer acting as hospital interpreter.

425
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,440
Yes.

426
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,080
I understand you speak almost perfect German.

427
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,120
That's rather unusual for an Englishman.

428
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,840
- Is it? 
- I wonder why your face seems familiar.

429
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,640
I have many friends in England.

430
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,960
Possibly we met there.

431
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,880
Possibly.

432
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,000
Excuse me.

433
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,520
Yes?

434
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,720
Do you wish to continue this conversation?

435
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,240
- No. 
- Prisoners cannot be required to answer any questions

436
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,320
other than relating to name, rank, and number.

437
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,240
Quite, quite.

438
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,200
The matter is of no importance.

439
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,120
You may dismiss the parade.

440
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,320

You should have come to see me before this, Mrs Evans.

480
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,720
Nothing wrong, is there?

481
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,160
No, but you're not exactly robust.

482
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,040
I had the flu last year, but nothing since.

483

And you're over 40, aren't you?

484
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,360
Only just.

485

Well, we needn't make any decision yet.

486
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,160
Decision?

487
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,080
I may have to suggest an operation.

488
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,360
I see.

489
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,080
Thank you, Doctor.

This one's on the house, he said. And lummy, it was.

494
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,400
- Well, dear? 
- Everything's all right.

495
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,520
Waste of time and money it was, making me come and see the doctor.

496
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,640
Your dad wanted to make quite sure, you know.

497
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,080
Yes, of course.

498
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,520
I always felt I'd failed him,

499
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,440
but never a word of reproach.

500
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,800
There's kind he is, all through.

501
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,840
But now, now I won't fail him.

502
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,960

Look, Robert, ever since Beryl's been living here with me,

I'm sorry, Robert.

515
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,200
I did treat you shabbily.

516
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,600
No, you didn't. I realise now you were never more than just fond of me.

517
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,600
You'd have realised it, too, even if Stephen hadn't turned up.

I always will be fond of you.

00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,880
As long as you're happy. That's what matters.

520
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,800
That's sweet of you.

521
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,240
My dear...

522
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,320
I'm sorry.

523
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,240
I'm not.

524
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,000
But it's got to be goodbye, Robert.

525
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,440
Goodbye.

526
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,520
Last Christmas, I had my first concert.

527
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,800
It's there I met Caroline.

528
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,880
Last Christmas, I was in Dachau concentration camp.

529
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,720
Christmas eve, a new batch of prisoners came in.

530
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,080
One of them brought me news of my family.

531
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,920
They'd been caught giving food to a Polish Jew.

532
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,320
They were taken out and shot.

533
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,840
My father, my mother...

534
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,720
All of them.

535
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,440
Only 36 shopping days to Christmas.

536
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,720
Christmas. Parked around a blazing fire

537
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,280
with a great bowl of hot rum punch.

538
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,200
Looks like it's snowing again. That should raise the temperature.

539
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,120
What binds me is living by courtesy of Jerry.

540
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,320
Can't see any future in it, really.

541
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,400
They say the first seven years are the hardest.

542
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,880
If the next six are like this...

543
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,040
The Red Cross parcels are bound to arrive soon.

544
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,040
- You've been saying that for exactly four months. 
- I've been meaning it!

545
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,960
All I can think about is food.

546
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,520
Roast turkey, mince pies, Christmas...

547
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,600
Oh, shut up!

548
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,840
Das ist alles.

549
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,760
Well, lad, it's me again.

550
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,240
Yes, padre.

551
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,560
David, they can't operate.

552
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,840
Not...ever?

553
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,320
No, David.

554
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,080
I won't ever see again?

555
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,400
I don't believe it. It's that German doctor.

556
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,840
- When I get back to Scotland... 
- No.

557
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,600
David, it's no use. You've got to face it.

558
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,880
I'll not need this anymore.

559
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,720
You feel now there's nothing left to live for,

560
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,560
and that feeling will go on for a long time,

561
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,880
but then you'll begin to remember the things that are left.

562
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,520
You'll begin to realise that this darkness of yours is not absolute.

563
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:57,920
David, the things that make life worthwhile for all of us...

564
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,240
kindness, affection, companionship...

565
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,080
The loss of your sight can never rob you of those things, David.

566
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,000
We're your friends here.

567
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,800
We offer you our help and understanding.

568
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,680
And waiting to welcome you home

569
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:21,000
when all this is over, are your own folk who love you.

570
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,240
I'll be all right.

571
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,240
HE SOBS

572
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,440
18, 20, play 21s.

573
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,120
- What's for tea? 
- Fancy cakes. Just fancy you've had 'em.

574
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,520
Good job we haven't got any brass monkeys in here,

575
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,400
we'd have the RSPCA down on us, and no error.

576
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,000
Can't you do anything with this ruddy stove?

577
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,920
Isn't there anything else to burn?

578
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,400
All right.

579
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,760
I never said a word, did I?

580
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,240
Go on, burn the ruddy thing.

581
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,720
It's enough for a brew-up.

582
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
They've come! Hundreds and hundreds of 'em!

583
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,560
All right, I'll bite. Hundreds of what?

584
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,440
Red Cross parcels, ruddy mountains of 'em!

585
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,600
ALL SHOUT AND CHEER

586
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,160
The Red Cross parcels are here!

587
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,360
ALL: Hooray!

588
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,000
Red Cross parcels are here!

589
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,920
ALL: Hooray!

590
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,760
MEN SING: # O come all ye faithful

591
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,080
# Joyful and triumphant

592
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,120
# O come ye, O come ye

593
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:39,680
# To Bethlehem

594
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,480
# Come and behold him

595
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,800
# Born the king of angels

596
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,600
# O come let us adore him

597
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,400
# O come let us adore him

598
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,720
# O come let us adore him

599
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:09,440
# Christ the Lord

600
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,760
# Sing choirs of angels... #

601
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,120
OC Sports, you. OC Music, Stephen Harley.

602
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,840
- Anything else I haven't covered? 
- No. Extraordinary, isn't it?

603
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,920
We seem to have specialists on every subject.

604
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,360
Aren't you an expert on anything?

605
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,760
Only racing, I'm afraid.

606
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,160
I had thought of starting a little bookmaking business.

607
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,040
Why not? Anyway, our money will be safe. You can't welsh on us.

608
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,520
THEY LAUGH

609
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,440
OK, number four shift.

610
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,280
- How far? 
- About three feet.

611
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,760
Good. By the way, doc, I put you down OC Entertainment.

612
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,120
- Fine. 
- What about me? I've had masses of experience backstage.

613
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,400
What sort of experience?

614
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,440
No need to make low insinuendos, old man.

615
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,920
Come on, fellows! Here it is!

616
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,360
Mail from home!

617
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,720
- Baker! 
- Here!

618
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,160
- Macdonald! 
- Here!

619
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,960
My father's been thrown through the dispensary window.

620
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,880
What, by an angry patient?

621
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,320
No, a bomb.

622
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,640
Well, well, they've requisitioned the church hall.

623
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,680
- I say, that's serious. 
- What is?

624
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,600
Veronica. She sweats all night.

625
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,520
Well, surely she can do something about it,

626
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,960
- with all these advertisements. 
- Don't be a halfwit.

627
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,320
Veronica's a filly and is getting ready for the flat.

628
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,840
Oh, sorry, old boy. I thought she was a popsy getting ready for the...

629
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,760
My kids have been evacuated to the country.

630
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,760
My girl joined the land army. She'll wait for me

631
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,880
- till the cows come home. 
- One way of putting it!

632
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,320
Listen to this. "Dear Daddy, today is your birthday.

633
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,720
"I hope it will be your last."

634
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,920
Hello, David.

635
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,320
- I didn't notice. Shall I read your letter for you? 
- Thank you.

636
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,080
It's signed...Elspeth.

637
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,960
"Dearest David,

638
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,840
"your mother says I am silly to worry about it,

639
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,640
"but it seems queer not a word from you yet.

640
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,000
"Do please send me a line when you get this.

641
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,520
"The three of us had a little party on your birthday.

642
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,280
"Wouldn't it be wonderful, darling,

643
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,840
"if you were home again for your next?

644
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,080
"I miss you all the time.

645
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,000
"Your loving Elspeth.

646
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,800
"PS, I'm going to join the Wrens."

647
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,240
Will you do me a favour?

648
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,680
I'd like to answer it at once.

649
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,120
Yes, of course.

650
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,600
Here's a form.

651
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,440
I've got a pencil. Ready when you are.

652
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,320
My dearest Elspeth,

653
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,400
I am dictating this letter because my wound

654
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,000
is not quite better yet.

655
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,840
I've been thinking things over.

656
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:51,200
And this is to ask if you will release me

657
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,120
from our engagement.

658
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,200
I realise now I don't feel the way

659
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,720
I...I fancied I did about you.

660
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,560
So it's best to make a definite break.

661
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,040
Yours, David.

662
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,320
David, why not tell her the truth?

663
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,800
It is the truth.

664
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,360
About your eyes, I mean.

665
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,120
Why not let her decide when she knows?

666
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,560
Will you please send that letter?

667
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,960
- Look, David... 
- Please!

668
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,920
All right, David.

669
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,240
Ted, it's it! It's it!

670
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,680
- It's it! 
- Brought it from Littlewoods?

671
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,600
Wonderful news, man, wonderful.

672
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,320
It's Dillith. There's a baby coming.

673
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,800
Good old Di! I reckon that's the best Christmas present you ever had.

674
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,600
I can see her now, the way she smiles with her eyes.

675
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,520
Aye, indeed. It's lovely to...

676
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,960
How do I look for a godfather?

677
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,880
Ah, yes! That's it, man.

678
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,200
You and Flo. It goes without saying.

679
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,720
And what's the matter?

680
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,160
Got the same chit from the income tax as me, old boy?

681
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,320
Well, don't worry. They can't put us in jag.

682
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,000
We've had it.

683
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,680
What wouldn't I give to see Queen's Park play Rangers this year.

684
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,160
Never mind, padre. They'll be playing over here one day.

685
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,360
'All British prisoners will parade at once.'

686
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,280
- Hello! What's cooking? 
- Forster's on the warpath. They're searching the camp.

687
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,720
Forster again.

688
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,640
'Achtung! Achtung!

689
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,000
'All British prisoners will parade at once.'

690
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,400
Raus, raus!

691
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,080
'Achtung! Achtung!

692
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,480
'All British prisoners will parade at once.'

693
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,840
HE SPEAKS GERMAN

694
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,040
Parade! Halt.

695
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,320
Gentlemen, we have discovered your tunnel.

696
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,000
Since you have thus abused the amenities accorded you,

697
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,240
and pending reconsideration of the camp's security measures,

698
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,160
all these amenities will be removed until further notice.

699
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,560
I've given instructions, therefore, to confiscate all books,

700
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,760
writing material, music, all tables and chairs,

701
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,680
bedding, mirrors, knives, and shaving equipment.

702
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,440
You may dismiss the parade.

703
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,280
Parade! Dismissed.

704
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,360
I shall have to grow a beard after all.

705
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,760
I don't know whether to have a two-pronged affair

706
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,960
- or a natty little imperial. 
- Wonder how long they'll keep it up.

707
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,560
Not more than a month, I should think.

708
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,480
- I'll keep on nagging the commandant. 
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.

709
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,320
Good afternoon.

710
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,200
I hope this slight setback won't prevent you from trying again.

711
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,640
But I must add,

712
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,000
a moat will be dug around the whole perimeter,

713
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,920
which, as you know, makes tunnelling impossible.

714
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,080
Captain Mitchell, who speaks such excellent German...

715
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,920
THEY CONVERSE IN GERMAN

716
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,120
What's he want this time?

717
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,640
Wants to know why I haven't written a single letter home.

718
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,880
Why should you? Mitchell may have had nobody particular to write to.

719
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,400
But he had. This came today.

720
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,360
It's from his wife.

721
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,200
You must answer, or she'll make enquiries.

722
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,600
That'll be fatal.

723
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,040
Seems a pretty cruel fraud.

724
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,920
You're wearing a dead man's shoes. You've got to get used to them.

725
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,320
My handwriting. She'd know it wasn't her husband.

726
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,760
Yes, takes a bit of figuring out.

727
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,640
Alibi for using your left hand. That's what you need.

728
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,880
I can't see much point in this,

729
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,000
now the blighters have taken away the football.

730
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,720
Well, anyway, it's good exercise.

731
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,040
Think so? I suppose next week they'll give us back the football

732
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,960
and take away the goalposts.

733
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,720
Come on, it's your turn now.

734
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,120
Ready?

735
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,240
Look out!

736
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,240
- Good morning, Mrs Mitchell. 
- Thank you.

737
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,640
I've mastered the boiler and the power plant.

738
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,920
I won't be defeated by a miserable wireless set.

739
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,360
I've heard from Geoffrey.

740
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,800
Really?

741
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,240
Is he well?

742
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,800
I don't know what to make of it.

743
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,280
He seems to have changed.

744
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,280
Good. Any change in Geoffrey could only be for the better.

745
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,600
Well, the change seems to include his handwriting.

746
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,920
Hurt his hand. He's using his left.

747
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,520
Listen to this.

748
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,520
"It is a world cut off completely from the real world.

749
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,200
"Time stands still here.

750
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,920
"The future is remote. The present empty.

751
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,680
"Even the past begins to seem unreal.

752
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,040
"But a man must have something to hold onto.

753
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,200
"He must forge lengths to keep him sane.

754
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,760
"Will you write to me again, Celia,

755
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,560
"as though I were a stranger?

756
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,680
"Somebody who knows nothing of your life and your home.

757
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,200
"Even of yourself."

758
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,680
Changed?! Why, he's even learned to write grammatically.

759
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,000
Write to him as though he were a stranger...

760
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,560
KNOCKING

761
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,640
Robert!

762
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,120
Come back to be briefed.

763
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,480
Sort of a hush-hush job.

764
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,800
Thought you wouldn't mind if I just called in

765
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,840
to say hail and farewell.

766
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,240
Of course not. Come in.

767
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,520
You look ill, Carol.

768
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,840
I'm all right.

769
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,840
I ran into Beryl in an odd sort of mood.

770
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,120
- I gather she isn't living with you any longer. 
- No.

771
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,080
No, she left soon after you went away.

772
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,760
Heard from Stephen yet?

773
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,680
Oh, yes, I've heard from Stephen.

774
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,040
- What's he say? 
- That our marriage is all washed up.

775
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,520
What?!

776
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,760
He got a letter accusing me of having an affair with you.

777
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:39,160
Carol, I... But who?

778
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,280
Beryl.

779
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,000
Ahh... I see.

780
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,840
And he actually believed it?

781
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,360
Yes.

782
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,040
I'll write back myself and tell him the whole thing's

783
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,520
a deliberate, malicious lie.

784
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,960
What for?

785
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,520
What for?! You don't want Stephen to go on thinking this, do you?

786
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,520
I don't care what he thinks now.

787
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,640
Carol, you mustn't take it like that.

788
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,120
Stephen's a prisoner of war.

789
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,560
If you were in his place, would you pay attention to a poison pen letter?

790
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,560
I don't know.

791
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,840
I'd never been in love before.

792
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:20,160
I thought being in love meant that you trusted each other completely.

793
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,040
All the things he said,

794
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,800
I believed every word.

795
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,240
Killed my love for him.

796
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,600
Caroline, my darling, I can't bear to see you cry.

797
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,520
Don't forget to drop us a line, dear, if there's anything you want.

798
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,080
I've tried to get used to it,

799
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,600
but I still can't believe it.

800
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,000
We were so much in love.

801
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,160
- Ah, it's a mystery to me. 
- He has a right to change his mind, I suppose.

802
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,800
Could it be that he doesn't think it's fair to make Elspeth wait on and on?

803
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,480
Do you think it might be that?

804
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,120
No. I don't think David's the kind

805
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,920
to make that sort of sacrifice for that sort of reason.

806
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,120
- Goodbye, my darling. 
- Goodbye. 
- Goodbye.

807
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,640
'The photograph I'm sending makes me look absurdly young,

808
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,280
'but I'm no longer young.

00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,400

825
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,160
Oh, what a kick in the pants that turned out to be.

826
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,320
Five times more officers than other ranks

827
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,360
and they have to knock the stuffing out of us.

828
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,640
It was a mistake having long-on too close to the wire.

829

If he has to run back to take a catch, he's had it.

830
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,440
Do you know what the Jerries want for a new ball? 500 cigarettes.

831
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,280
- Sheer blackmail. 
- Oh, I think it's worth it if this marvellous weather continues.

832
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,360
I wonder if they've been having an early spring at home.

No! It's my steady.

848

She says the works manager's fallen for her.

849
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,120
Says he's a key man.

850
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,640
Sounds like one of them backdoor key men to me.

851
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,040
You and your pin-up girls.

852
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,920
My pinup's Tessie O'Shea, with a rawlplug.

853
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,320
- Yeah, but in my experience... 
- Your experience?

854
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,720
Cor blimey, one sniff of a barmaid's apron,

855
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,480
and you'd be on your knees, sonny boy.

856
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,720
That's all you know. Teach you a thing or two.

857
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,160
What's the matter, Ted? Bad news?

858
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,600
Ted?

859
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,360
Blimey, I never saw that one.

860
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,720
Hey, my old woman's gone on the buses.

861
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,200
- Oh, you'll be walking the kids when you get home. 
- If we get home.

862
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,320
It's a firm stand I'm going to take.

863
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,560
The rest of them you can eat,

864
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,320
but not Lili Marleen.

865
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:46,240
She's got such a trusting look in her eye.

866
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:51,400
Besides, next winter I shall use her as a hot water bottle.

867
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,680
I've had a letter, Dai.

868
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,440
Amazing. Perhaps there's one for me

869
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,920
with news of the baby.

870
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,960
No letter for you.

871
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,760
There is news.

872
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,600
Flo's all right?

873
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,440
Not Ann-Marie?

874
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,960
She's OK. Letter's from her.

875
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,800
"It's a baby girl. She's doing nice.

876
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,640
"Dillith..."

877
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,960
You'll have it sooner or later.

878
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:26,120
Seems that doctor warned her about it being dangerous,

879
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,280
because of her age.

880
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,600
She wouldn't be put off.

881
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,600
Flo was with her at the end.

882
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,120
It was all over quite quick.

883
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:41,120
Flo's going to look after the baby until you get back.

884
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,480
The play's the thing.

885
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,840
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

886
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,640
Well, what happens in the end?

887
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,120
Do they bump the dirty old basket off?

888
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,280
Well, there's a sort of all-round massacre,

889
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,840
and Hamlet gets killed himself.

890
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,880
First class gangster stuff. The old boy certainly knew his onion.

891
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,680
You wait till we get to Richard III.

892
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,720
There's a murder on practically every page.

893
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,120
You're getting pretty hot at this Braille business.

894
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,640
Och, it's easy. But I'm still terrible clumsy with my hands.

895
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,400
Oh, I don't know about that. That tobacco pouch you made was smashing.

896
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,560
I've got sort of used to it now.

897
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,480
And, well, you've all been so...

898
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,520
You get on with your reading. I want to know what happens next.

899
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,000
Right.

900
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,480
'Celia, your letter has arrived with the photographs.

901
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,520
'They're in front of me as I write.

902
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,880
'You ask me to describe our life here

903
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,240
'so that you may picture it in your imagination.

904
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,120
'From where I sit, I can hear the sound of a piano.

905
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,800
'It is my friend Stephen Harley.

906
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,720
'I wish you could hear this music,

907
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,760
'for it describes our life here

908
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,520
'better than I could ever do with words.

909
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,520
'It tells of men emerging from the twilight.

910
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,240
'Turning their faces inwards from the wire.

911
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,160
'Creating in miniature a world of their own.

912
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,040
'It tells of men who have come to terms with the present

913
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,560
'and find it far from empty.

914
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:26,360
'Men who no longer lie down to fate but face it.

915
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,120
'And find their own ways of beating it.'

916
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,760
THEY SING HYMN

917
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,880
GENTLE CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS

'All this goes to make up the picture of our life here,

921
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,720
'made bearable only by the letters and parcels

922
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,760
'we receive from home.

'And that is true not only of us

'Great sprawling towns of 20,000 men

'The months pass and my thoughts are constantly of you, Celia.

'They don't make the housing problem any easier.

'But they bring us eagerly awaited news of the outside world.

'A little while ago there was a rumour

'that some of us were to be repatriated.

'I allowed myself to dream that these letters of ours

'could come to life.

'But the commission never came.

'Were we forgotten?

943
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,240
'Or was it just one more reprisal?'

944
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:53,840
Being they are prisoners,

945
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,240
this practice must come to rest.

946
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,160
Orders.

947
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:02,880
Finally, the recent operations at Dieppe,

948
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:08,800
as a reprisal for such an unwarranted action,

949
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:14,320
all British prisoners of war of cellblock 27

950
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,880
will, until further notice, remain manacled

951
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,760
from dawn until dusk.

952
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,240
You may dismiss the parade.

953
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,520
HE SHOUTS ORDERS

954
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,240
Cigarette?

955
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,680
Thanks.

956
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,160
It's easy. Sardine key.

957
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,960
Turn to the right.

958
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,720
Turn to the left.

959
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,040
Bob's your uncle.

960
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,000
All part of the Red Cross service.

961
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,720
THEY LAUGH

962
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:15,720
'Our third winter is approaching,

963
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:18,080
'bringing with it a new enemy.

964
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,960
'It's not the duration but the indefiniteness.

965
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,640
'For if a man knew the length of his sentence,

966
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,040
'he could plan accordingly.

01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,280
'Afterwards in our memories,

968
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,520
'we shall relive only the sunny days

969
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,960
'or pleasant scenes,

'the freedom of mind and the comradeship.

01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,960
'We shall forget the wet days, the wet weeks.

01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,640
'Those days when it seemed an effort to do nothing

973
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:44,760
'and our bunks were the only release.

974
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,040
'Deep down in the hearts of all of us,

975
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,160
'there dwells a lonely ache,

976
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,440
'a desperate yearning for those we love

977
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:56,680
'and a fear, fear of becoming forgotten men.

01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,640
'Write to me again soon, Celia.

01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,880
'You could never know how great the comfort is

01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,760
'that your letters bring to me.

01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,240
'They're more than comfort.

'They give me strength and hope and happiness.

983
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,160
'You will never know how much they mean to me.'

01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,720
'Oh, my dear, I am so terribly moved by the way you write.

985
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:24,480
'Is it too late to recapture the happiness of our first years together?'

986
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:31,360
'I have no place in your past or your future, Celia.

987
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,440
'You must think of your husband as dead.

988
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,520
'This is goodbye.'

989
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,760
'I understand. Don't be afraid.

990
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,400
'I'll help you back.

991
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,960
'I'll give you back your strength,

01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,240
'the strength you've given to me writing to me through these dark years.

01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,120
'I'll wait for you.'

994
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,640
DISTANT DRONE OF PLANES

995
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,040
PLANES APPROACH

996
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,200
Fortresses.

997
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,640
They'll soon be able to see the Channel.

998
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,920
They'll be home in time for tea.

999
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:01,080
That's exactly £157 you owe me.

1000
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,400
Cut you through the pack. Double or quits.

1001
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,280
Not on your life. I've got my old age to think of.

1002
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,680
Bloodsucker.

1003
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,760
Oh, well, bang goes my gratuity.

1004
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,000
Cheap enough to pass the time.

1005
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,720
Funny how much you learn about time when you're killing it.

1006
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,400
Such as what?

1007
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,000
I've got a theory that everything that counts is done by busy people.

1008
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,560
When you've got too little time, it's extraordinary what you can do with it.

1009
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,600
And when you've got all the time in the world,

1010
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,880
like us, you don't do a damn thing.

1011
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,520
I say, you're becoming quite a philosopher in your old age.

1012
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,360
Why not? The war hasn't exactly chosen us to be heroes.

1013
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,920
I know exactly what I'm going to do with my time right now.

1014
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,680
I'm going to climb into my bunk

1015
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,920
and do absolutely nothing till supper.

1016
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:46,280
They're talking about Teran for the derby this year.

1017
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,160
It'll be the fourth derby I've missed.

1018
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:52,440
Four derbies. That's a hell of a lot of time.

1019
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:56,360
With nothing up or down on the book to show for it.

1020
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,600
Planting leeks again this year, Dai?

1021
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,040
I was thinking of trying some asparagus.

1022
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,920
Asparagus? That takes seven years, cock.

1023
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,200
Aye.

1024
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,280
I don't give it more than another year myself.

1025
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,720
Another year?

1026
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,520
Gwyneth will be four.

1027
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,960
Flo's hair has gone all white, she says.

1028
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,880
Everything's changing.

1029
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,920
Do you think we'll be able to pick it up?

1030
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,680
The business and everything?

1031
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,880
Search me. We're not as young as we were, Dai.

1032
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:35,400
No, Ted, we're not as young as we were.

1033
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,800
Surely they'll invade soon.

1034
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,040
Yeah, that's what you said last year.

1035
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,440
And the year before.

1036
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,040
What's there, mate, holiday list?

1037
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,240
Yeah, it's got you down for August, 1949.

1038
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,080
I wrote that for Caroline.

1039
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,960
Somehow it expressed what I felt when I first met her.

1040
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,720
It was after a concert.

1041
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,160
There weren't any taxis.

1042
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,440
We walked back across the park.

1043
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,120
After a bit, it began to rain.

1044
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,480
I put my coat over her shoulders.

1045
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,840
You're still in love with her, aren't you?

1046
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,800
I've tried to shut her out of my thoughts completely.

1047
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:15,200
But I can't. I long for her all the time.

1048
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,760
I'm a bigger fool than you are.

1049
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,440
Falling in love with a photograph. A dream.

1050
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,960
And a home in a strange land.

1051
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,720
Achtung!

1052
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,640
Oh, carry on.

1053
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,840
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

1054
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,120
Oh, please, do carry on.

1055
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,720
Each time I visit this camp,

1056
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,800
I'm intrigued as to where we met before.

1057
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,680
But now I think I know the answer.

1058
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:44,080
Your name wasn't always Geoffrey Mitchell.

1059
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,480
Your identification photograph is being sent

1060
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,320
to Gestapo headquarters in Berlin.

1061
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,280
They have a large collection of photographs there.

1062
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:55,800
It will be interesting to make comparisons.

1063
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,720
I suppose it had to come.

1064
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,160
They always catch up with you in the end.

1065
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,720
Repatriation, fellas! Repatriation!

1066
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,400
THEY ALL SCOFF

1067
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,160
Great news, gentlemen, great news! Repatriation!

1068
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,920
And this time it's the real McCoy.

1069
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:15,160
The thing that makes me mouth water, real live girls.

1070
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,560
- All lining up waiting for me. 
- Girls, what are they?

1071
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,720
Bipeds, old boy, furnished with two of practically everything!

1072
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,520
A mixed German and Swiss medical commission

1073
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,800
will examine all those whose names are down for repatriation.

1074
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:30,320
Apparently it's a rush job, so anybody who gets his ticket

1075
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,800
will leave in a week's time.

1076
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,640
MEN CHEER So you've got a chance.

1077
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,280
Yes.

1078
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,280
But we must have positive evidence to justify repatriation.

1079
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,560
Of course.

1080
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,640
Ah. Anything else, Corporal?

1081
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,560
Well, sir, every time I breathe,

1082
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,040
I can feel me liver knocking up against me kidneys.

1083
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:49,560
- Come here. 
- Yes, sir.

1084
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:50,800
Cough, please.

1085
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,600
Cough? Blimey, do you want me to bring up my appendix?

1086
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,760
Ja.

1087
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,640
You have passed.

1088
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,920
Thank you, sir.

1089
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:04,960
Matthews.

1090
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,880
I wonder if you'll get through.

1091
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,200
Hello, Evans. You'll soon be seeing your youngster.

1092
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:13,360
Yes, indeed. I'm sorry to hear about you and Captain Grayson, sir.

1093
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,400
Oh, well, the flat racing season's over.

1094
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,320
That Swiss fellow had the nerve to congratulate me on my fitness.

1095
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,760
Ha ha! Well?

1096
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,480
- I got my ticket, all right. 
- Fine.

1097
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,120
You have passed.

1098
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,120
Suits me, sir.

1099
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,840
Captain Mitchell.

1100
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,400
Ah.

1101
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,160
You need not strip, Captain Mitchell.

1102
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,720
I regret your case is deferred

1103
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:44,280
until the next board in six months' time.

1104
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:49,680
Morris.

1105
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:53,840
And once it's discovered he's not Mitchell, he's sunk. We've got to do something for him.

1106
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,080
Yes, but what?

1107
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:58,160
- Excuse me, sir. Can we put up a scheme to you? 
- Sure. Sit down.

1108
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:00,880
- What's it all about? 
- We know the spot Captain Mitchell's in.

1109
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,400
- We thought we'd fix a stunt to get him out of here. 
- What's the scheme?

1110
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,160
There's a list for repatriation in the commandant's office.

1111
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:10,320
- We thought if we could get it, alter the names... 
- Stage a break-in, sir.

1112
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,560
Here, hold on. We aren't professional burglars.

1113
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,960
Well, yes, sir, as a matter of fact... well, I was.

1114
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,960
Were you really? Well, how awfully interesting.

1115
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,280
Commandant's office. Only one wire to cut.

1116
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,360
Yes, but what about the perimeter lights?

1117
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:26,040
- They put them out when there's an air raid. 
- And they've been as regular as clockwork.

1118
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,600
I believe we've got something!

1119
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,000
- Suppose we do get the list. What then? 
- I can type.

1120
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,440
Scratch out one name and type Mitchell's on instead.

1121
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:36,200
Just a minute. Don't you see, the chap whose name goes off has to stay behind.

1122
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,480
Well, uh, my name begins with M, sir.

1123
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:41,320
You'd really give up your ticket home?

1124
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:42,880
Why not?

1125
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,560
But I thought all the girls were lining up for you to come home?

1126
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:48,320
Well, so they are. But they'll wait.

1127
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,840
You are a sportsman.

1128
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,440
Gentleman, we'll have a smack at it.

1129
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,440
Now, as I see it, the drill is this...

1130
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:01,120
DISTANT SINGING

1131
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,240
# My eyes are dim, I cannot see

1132
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:31,800
# I have not brought my specs with me... #

1133
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,440
Shh, shhh!

1134
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,120
PLANES APPROACH

1135
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,400
Here come the boys. Bang on the dot.

1136
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,000
- What do you mean? 
- Well, just another raid, old boy.

1137
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,440
All right, chaps, light up and sing out.

1138
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,120
THEY CONTINUE SINGING

1139
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,560
Well, they had better start.

1140
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:04,320
I know. God bless the RAF.

1141
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:13,680
Here he is.

1142
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,640
Good boy. Look out!

1143
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,120
All clear.

1144
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:22,080
THEY CHAT IN GERMAN

1145
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,280
THEY LAUGH

1146
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,680
That's the lock you've got to pick.

1147
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:02,960
Good, there's a typewriter.

1148
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,520
Get down!

1149
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,360
- Type on the floor. 
- OK.

1150
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,440
It's tougher than I thought.

1151
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,040
Let me try.

1152
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:21,560
- Must be a bit out of practice. 
- I'll say.

1153
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:24,400
Einrichtung, einrichtung...

1154
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,760
Good, this is it.

1155
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:53,720
Sing, you so-and-sos, sing!

1156
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,520
- That'll do. 
- Come on.

1157
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,040
- That'll fool 'em. 
- Should do.

1158
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:32,440
- Let's split up and get back to our own huts. 
- OK, sir.

1159
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,600
DOG GROWLS

1160
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,640
GUNSHOTS

1161
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,960
- What's going on? 
- You're not supposed to know.

1162
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:56,440
The boys were putting your name on the repatriation list.

1163
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,160
GUNSHOTS

1164
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,360
DOG HOWLS

1165
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,160
GUNFIRE CONTINUES

1166
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,760
MUSIC AND SINGING

1167
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,800
You will all remain here until the other huts have been checked!

1168
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,720
Permission to go home, sir?

1169
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:09,760
Yes, provided you put a fiver on Teran at the derby for me.

1170
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:13,040
- It's you that ought to be going home. 
- Oh, don't you believe it.

1171
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,760
I'm a social parasite.

1172
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,800
The sort we're fighting to get rid of.

1173
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,200
That's right. I've got to stay here and exterminate him.

1174
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,400
Go slow with the popsies, old boy.

1175
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:24,400
Don't forget to save a couple of blondes for your Uncle Jim.

1176
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,840
- That's a promise. 
- Course, I was forgetting.

1177
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:29,240
You're one of those one-woman blokes, aren't you?

1178
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:30,760
Yes, that's my trouble.

1179
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,920
Sorry, then. Always putting my foot in it.

1180
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,360
Tell the girls round Hammersmith that I'll be home soon

1181
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,720
and I've got plenty saved up to give them a treat with.

1182
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:40,040
- Yeah, you bet. 
- I'll keep a job warm for him.

1183
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:43,240
- Horsfall, Evans, and Mathews. 
- Unlimited.

1184
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:48,080
Hello, Mathews. Feeling all right?

1185
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,040
Yes, it's all right, sir. I was a sissy passing out like that.

1186
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,880
I can never thank you for what you've done.

1187
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:56,480
Forget it. Just keep your head down on the parade and Bob's your uncle.

1188
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:59,080
- Thanks. 
- Don't worry, sir. You'll get through all right.

1189
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:00,520
We'll be right behind you, sir.

1190
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,680
One other thing. What about the German MO?

1191
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,920
He's certain to be on parade,

1192
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,920
and he's likely to remember that Mitchell's name wasn't on the list.

1193
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,240
I know. I've thought of that.

1194
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:15,360
I'm going to start up a conversation while they're calling the names.

1195
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,200
He only speaks about a dozen words in English.

1196
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,800
You leave it to me.

1197
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,880
Hello, David, my boy.

1198
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,160
Goodbye and good luck.

1199
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:27,880
Goodbye, sir, and thank you all.

1200
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,040
See you again before you know where you are.

1201
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,280
- Yes. 
- Come on, David.

1202
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,440
Don't forget. We've got a bridge date tonight.

1203
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,280
Don't forget the cigarettes you owe me.

1204
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:37,880
Play you double or quits tonight.

1205
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,000
Ambrose.

1206
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,520
Anderson.

1207
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,960
Burns.

1208
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,160
There are a lot of things I'd like to say, but...

1209
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,320
but I can't.

1210
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:52,200
Go on. Off you go.

1211
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,840
Goodbye. Good luck.

1212
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,960
- So long, old boy. 
- Good luck.

1213
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,840
Keep out of the German MO's eyeline.

1214
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,480
Grant.

1215
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:03,800
Harley.

1216
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,280
Hunt.

1217
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:10,040
Horsfall.

1218
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:11,360
Jackson.

1219
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:13,880
Jessop.

1220
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:17,480
How soon do you think the war will end now, Doctor?

1221
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,640
Six months or one year.

1222
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,880
By then, you'll be speaking fluent English.

1223
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,800
You think I've made good progression?

1224
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:27,640
Oh, terrific. Yes, you Germans certainly have a gift for languages.

1225
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:30,600
- You think so? 
- Of course. Yes.

1226
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:34,120
After the war, they might make me headmaster of Oxford University.

1227
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,880
THEY LAUGH

1228
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,080
Mitchell.

1229
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,000
Mitre.

1230
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
THEY LAUGH

1231
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:49,040
Achtung. March!

1232
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:53,440
"LAND OF HOPE AND GLORY" PLAYS

1233
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,600
I'm sorry, madam, but you can't go in.

1234
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,200
I must. It's my husband. Please.

1235
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,080
Excuse me.

1236
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,320
Excuse me.

1237
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,240
What's happened to the iron gate, Mother?

1238
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,200
It went for salvage two years ago.

1239
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,000
I'll miss the squeaking of that old gate.

1240
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,880
Have there been any other changes?

1241
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:03,880
No. I kept your room exactly as it was

1242
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,360
the day you went off to France.

1243
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,880
Same old smell.

1244
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,000
Like soap and furniture polish.

1245
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:18,160
You come in here for a minute and I'll get you something to eat.

1246
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,960
David.

1247
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,800
Elspeth.

1248
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:34,960
That last letter.

1249
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,160
Your mother showed me.

1250
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:41,520
Telling the truth about your eyes.

1251
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,200
So that was the reason.

1252
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,400
The reason for what?

1253
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,360
For breaking our engagement.

1254
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,720
But you can't go on being engaged

1255
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,600
when you're not in love any longer.

1256
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,600
You can't go on breaking a person's heart

1257
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,160
to satisfy your own stupid pride.

1258
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,920
I'm not prepared to discuss the matter.

1259
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,240
Neither am I. David...

1260
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:06,040
Why did you have to make me so dreadfully unhappy?

1261
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:35,760
Caroline!

1262
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,280
But...but what are you...

1263
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,200
There were some things I left behind.

1264
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,520
Caretaker let me in.

1265
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,160
I had no idea.

1266
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:50,560
I'll go now.

1267
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,160
Caroline.

1268
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,960
Yes, Stephen?

1269
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,120
Are you all right?

1270
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,520
Why are you crying?

1271
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:06,520
Because I'm a fool.

1272
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:09,400
Are you unhappy with Robert?

1273
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,240
I'm not with Robert.

1274
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,040
Oh, Stephen.

1275
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,080
Why did you have to believe that letter?

1276
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,160
It wasn't true? It wasn't true?!

1277
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,240
No. Not then.

1278
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,600
Go on.

1279
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,960
When I got your letter, it was as if

1280
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,800
all I'd ever believed in didn't exist anymore.

1281
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,840
I didn't care what happened.

1282
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,480
He was in love with you?

1283
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,920
- Yes. 
- And you?

1284
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,960
No.

1285
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,040
Let me go now. Please.

1286
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,720
Listen, Caroline.

1287
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:50,440
There, everything seemed so... so out of proportion.

1288
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:52,720
I think I was mad for a bit.

1289
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,560
You see, I loved you so desperately.

1290
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,400
Still do.

1291
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,920
- Always shall. 
- Stephen...

1292
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:14,440
Thanks, mate.

1293
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:18,280
Thanks.

1294
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,040
Well, this is it, Dai.

1295
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,040
- Yes. 
- How do you feel?

1296
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:24,160
Empty. Empty inside.

1297
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,880
Me too, like it wasn't me standing here at all.

1298
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,600
Come on, Dai. Let's get weaving.

1299
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:37,480
KNOCKING

1300
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,320
Hello, old girl.

1301
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,880
Hello, Ted.

1302
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,320
Journey all right?

1303
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:54,840
I was seasick.

1304
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,160
Stomach always was your weakness.

1305
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,280
Suits you.

1306
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,560
Oh, Ted.

1307
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:06,760
There, there.

1308
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,400
I can't leave Dai out in the cold like that.

1309
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,480
- Oh, Dai. 
- Hello, Flo.

1310
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:16,240
Oh, it's lovely to see you. Come on in.

1311
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,560
- Where is she? 
- In here.

1312
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:43,360
- Hello, Gwyneth. 
- Hello.

1313
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:46,320
- Do you know who I am? 
- Yes. You're my daddy, aren't you?

1314
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,120
That's it. Look.

1315
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,160
I made this in the prison camp for you.

1316
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,960
- Can she shut her eyes? 
- No, she can't.

1317
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:00,040
- My doll can. 
- She's lovely.

1318
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:05,960
So that's settled.

1319
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:09,280
Captain Hasek reports to duty to Czech headquarters.

1320
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:11,880
There was something I wanted to ask, sir.

1321
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:14,720
- About Mrs Mitchell. 
- Oh, yes. Very awkward, of course.

1322
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:17,920
Don't worry, Captain Hasek. We've got that matter in hand.

1323
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:20,280
I wanted to suggest, sir, as it's my responsibility,

1324
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,480
that if the notification of her husband's death

1325
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:25,200
could be delayed until I've seen Mrs Mitchell myself.

1326
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,440
She'll have to be told through the usual channels.

1327
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:30,360
- Yes, sir, but in a case like this... 
- War Office will look after it.

1328
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:34,400
Of course, if you'd like to see her off your own bat, there's nothing to stop you.

1329
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,120
I see. Thank you, sir.

1330
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:42,960
Looks like rain.

1331
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:49,400
My dear. It's no good going on hoping.

1332
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:50,680
You must face up to it.

1333
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:54,280
That he won't come back?

1334
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,680
That he won't come back.

1335
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,360
Grandpa. It's starting to rain.

1336
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:05,680
Come help me put the chairs in the summer house.

1337
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:07,160
Oh, come on.

1338
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:10,400
DOORBELL RINGS

1339
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,840
Oh...

1340
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:29,440
I'm sorry. I was expecting someone else.

1341
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,920
Mrs Mitchell, I came to see you.

1342
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:34,560
I have some news for you, of your husband.

1343
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,560
Oh.

1344
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,280
Come in, please.

1345
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:51,560
What?

1346
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,200
Your husband is dead.

1347
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,680
Dead?

1348
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:01,480
He was killed four years ago

1349
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:03,640
in the fighting at Saint-Ardennie.

1350
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:07,000
I heard from him. From the prison camp.

1351
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,440
Your husband was never in that prison camp.

1352
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:12,480
He was never a prisoner of war.

1353
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,680
But...the letters...

1354
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,400
I wrote those letters.

1355
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:20,360
- You? 
- Yes.

1356
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,080
But I...

1357
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,040
I took these from your husband's body.

1358
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:29,720
I took his name, his uniform, his identity.

1359
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,840
For four years, I've been Geoffrey Mitchell.

1360
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:40,680
But why?

1361
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:44,720
To save my life. The Germans were after me.

1362
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:48,480
- The letters? 
- Later in the camp, I had to write.

1363
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,960
They suspected me.

1364
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:52,920
If I hadn't answered your letters, they'd have been on to me.

1365
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,080
You had to answer my letters.

1366
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:56,720
I understand that. You...

1367
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,800
You even had to go on writing.

1368
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,240
I understand that, too.

1369
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:06,400
Why did you have to write the way you did?

1370
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,680
I believed every word you said.

1371
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:14,440
At first, I had to make you tell me

1372
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:16,520
as much as possible about yourself.

1373
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,080
I was fighting for my life.

1374
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:20,840
And then...

1375
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,640
..I got your other letters.

1376
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,200
Photos of the children.

1377
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,600
Glimpses of things lost to me forever and...

1378
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:36,400
It was as if you were offering me a new world.

1379
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,840
It was easy out there to delude oneself.

1380
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:46,760
And I believed a wonderful thing had happened.

1381
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:48,560
My husband had left me.

1382
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:52,240
And those letters made me believe he was mine again,

1383
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:55,040
that everything would be as I'd hoped it would be.

1384
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:58,440
I planned for the day he'd come home again...

1385
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,280
..for a new life together.

1386
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,520
What a fool I was.

1387
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:08,320
You were still in love with him?

1388
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,640
How I can tell now?

1389
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:15,520
I know there's no excuse for what I did, but...

1390
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,080
Will you go now, please?

1391
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:21,440
You must believe that I meant what I wrote.

1392
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:24,520
Your letters came to be my life.

1393
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:28,000
You see, I fell in love with you.

1394
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:33,000
It was a dream then. Now it's reality.

1395
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,960
SHE SOBS

1396
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:18,080
'I allowed myself to dream

1397
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:21,120
'that these letters of ours could come to life.

1398
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:23,840
'That I could see with my own eyes your home,

1399
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,840
'the children, yourself.'

1400
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:11,440
Celia, you're wanted on the telephone.

1401
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:12,600
Who is it?

1402
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,520
Captain Hasek.

1403
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,880
