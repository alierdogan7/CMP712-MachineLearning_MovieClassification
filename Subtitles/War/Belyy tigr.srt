- Look. Who is this?
- The uniform does not look German.

11
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:32,806
- Must be Romanians or Italians.
- The Huns.

12
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:36,388
- Who?
- The Huns, meaning the Hungarians.

13
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,830

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Where are the legs?

19
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:48,023
Go look over there.

20
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:03,988
Shut it down!

21
00:03:09,749 --> 00:03:13,060
What's going on over there?

22
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,292
Comrade Captain,
they will not let go.

23
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:17,749
- What does not let go?
- The hands.

24
00:03:17,786 --> 00:03:20,160
- What hands?
- The driver's.

25
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,700
The driver's?

26
00:03:42,588 --> 00:03:47,070
- I think he is alive, Peter.
- That's right. He is alive.

27
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,762
Stop!

28
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,465
- What's up?
- Take him to the hospital.

29
00:04:24,312 --> 00:04:26,462
- The dead one?
- He is alive.

30
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:30,277
- Dead or alive, what do you care?
- Load him on.

31
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:08,408
- Where do we take this one?
- Into the woods.

32
00:05:08,513 --> 00:05:11,221
You did not even look at him.

33
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:19,055
- He has a pulse.
- Get him in the tent.

34
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,563
Put him here.

35
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:51,990
I've never seen anything like this.

36
00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:55,782
90% of body burned,
but he is still alive.

37
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,850
He won't live for even 2 hours.

38
00:06:01,109 --> 00:06:03,844
Give me the ointment!

39
00:06:38,784 --> 00:06:40,953
- Hello.
- Hello.

40
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,152
Where is the tankman?

41
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:09,561
- How long is he with us?
- Three weeks.

42
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:13,914
90% burns, sepsis,
but he is still alive.

43
00:07:15,806 --> 00:07:19,014
Take him to be rebandaged.

44
00:07:30,263 --> 00:07:33,745
- Where is the burn?
- Some strange pathology.

45
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,327
Only three days ago there was not a
single piece of healthy skin on him.

46
00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:43,078
What is your name, soldier?

47
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:48,510
First last name?

48
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:55,055
- Your unit number?
- I don't know.

49
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:06,813
- May I?
- Yes, sit down.

50
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,095
Ivan Ivanovich Naydenov.
Year of birth 1914.

51
00:08:11,418 --> 00:08:16,214
- Russian, not a member of
Communist Party, tank driver.  
- Wait a minute...

52
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:20,553
You said he had no documents
and cannot remember anything.

53
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,554
From an accompanying letter
from the field hospital.

54
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:26,261
It said "unknown tank driver".

55
00:08:26,366 --> 00:08:29,266
And how did you find out his name?

56
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:34,383
We all just started
calling him Ivan Ivanovich.

57
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,649
We decided that his last name
should be Naydenov (the one found)

58
00:08:37,755 --> 00:08:43,979
because the accompanying letter
stated that he was "found in a tank."

59
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:47,226
What about the year of
birth and party membership?

60
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:49,425
His teeth look about 30 years old.

61
00:08:49,426 --> 00:08:51,519
Party membership
- safe guess.

62
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:55,367
There is some mistake here.

63
00:08:55,472 --> 00:08:58,266
Are these really his documents?

64
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:03,705
- They are his.
- It's written here 90% burn.

65
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,250
That is correct. He
had burns on about 90%

66
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:11,301
- of the surface of his body.
- Is that a joke?

67
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:14,935
- Where are the burns?
- You see, we are not able

68
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,560
to explain this fully, but the
patient recovered completely.

69
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:25,164
Obviously this is due to some
amazing properties of his body

70
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:28,290
and no doubt this is a
miraculous phenomenon.

71
00:09:29,055 --> 00:09:33,553
So, what do we do
with this phenomenon?

72
00:09:36,112 --> 00:09:39,551
He possesses a rare case
of retrograde amnesia.

73
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:44,889
He remembers all his habits,
remembers... the alphabet

74
00:09:44,994 --> 00:09:48,559
can write, but can
not remember who he is,

75
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,647
where he is from, who are his
family, and what happened to him.

76
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,776
I believe he is not fit
for military service.

77
00:09:57,882 --> 00:10:01,712
A tank driver? Don't you know
the orders of Supreme Command?

78
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:04,573
I know. -Tank drivers
discharged from hospitals

79
00:10:04,678 --> 00:10:07,443
are always to be
reenlisted in tank units.

80
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:12,295
I know, but this is a special
case. The soldier has no memory.

81
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,156
One doesn't need much
memory to load a tank cannon.

82
00:12:06,956 --> 00:12:10,136
Hey, soldier! Come here!

83
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:20,012
- Who are you?
- Sergeant Naydenov.

84
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:22,838
Mechanic-driver
with the 2nd company.

85
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:25,798
And what are you doing here?

86
00:12:28,163 --> 00:12:32,633
This tank was shot by a Panther.

87
00:12:32,988 --> 00:12:36,023
It ambushed him.

88
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,200
- Why do you think so?
- He told me about it.

89
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,207
- Who told you?
- The tank.

90
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:48,796
This tank.

91
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:58,171
Did this tank tell you anything?

92
00:13:22,795 --> 00:13:25,524
A Tiger burned him.

93
00:13:25,992 --> 00:13:29,723
The same one that burned
my tank... The White Tiger.

94
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:37,217
Soldier, back to your
unit. At the double.

95
00:13:37,322 --> 00:13:39,542
Yes, sir.

96
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,975
- Do you know him?
- I do.

97
00:13:46,496 --> 00:13:49,863
He is a very good mechanic. Only ever
since he came back from the hospital,

98
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:53,884
something has been wrong with his memory.
- God knows who gets sent
to the front nowadays.

99
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,820
He should be in a mental institution,
and they send him to the front.
Give me a cigarette!

100
00:13:57,925 --> 00:14:03,702
Listen, Nikolay, I have heard
about the White Tiger too.

101
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:07,434
- They say it is some sort of ghost.
- Nonsense!

102
00:14:10,302 --> 00:14:13,054
Quit listening to
all sorts of nonsense!

103
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:30,120
Stop! There are legends circulating
in our army about this tank.

104
00:14:30,225 --> 00:14:32,373
Continue.

105
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:42,449
At the battle of Babruysk we
were attacked by Russian tanks.

106
00:14:42,554 --> 00:14:44,935
There were over 20 of them.

107
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:53,183
It seemed they will destroy
everything in their path.

108
00:14:57,824 --> 00:15:04,074
Suddenly a tank appeared from the
side. A Tiger tank, painted white.

109
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,367
A T-6 tank.

110
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,473
He began to destroy
the Russian tanks.

111
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:27,132
In 10 minutes he destroyed all
Russian tanks and then disappeared.

112
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:31,208
It looked as though he
vanished into thin air.

113
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:37,200
Did you personally see it?

114
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:53,172
He himself did not see it. He was
told about this battle by a friend

115
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:55,554
who participated in it.

116
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:04,432
You cannot defeat this white devil.

117
00:16:11,252 --> 00:16:13,995
Why is that?

118
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:26,495
Because he is the triumph
of the German spirit.

119
00:16:35,939 --> 00:16:39,693
Sharipov, wait for me here.

120
00:16:57,735 --> 00:17:00,739
<i>He was first seen in Polesia. </i>

121
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,944
<i>All Tigers would get stuck
in swamps, and he did not.</i>

122
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:09,555
He would destroy
entire tank battalions.

123
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,649
Then he appeared in the
north. Then in the south.

124
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:18,924
Every time he would appear
in our rear. He would destroy

125
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:22,867
about 15 of our tanks and self-propelled
guns and disappear into the woods.

126
00:17:23,114 --> 00:17:26,206
How is this possible?

127
00:17:26,383 --> 00:17:31,182
15 of our tanks can not
destroy one Nazi tank?

128
00:17:31,414 --> 00:17:34,824
Allow me, Georgi Konstantinovich.

129
00:17:35,975 --> 00:17:39,556
This is not a standard production
tank. I will state general opinion...

130
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:42,689
Germans have only one such tank.

131
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:45,491
If high-explosive
shells cannot penetrate

132
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:48,197
his armor is at least 250 mm.

133
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:51,332
But then he should
weigh about 100 tons.

134
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:53,956
The most powerful German tank engine

135
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:57,514
- is only 700 horsepower.
- What do you suggest?

136
00:17:58,091 --> 00:18:02,361
Let's do what the Germans
did. Create one special tank

137
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:06,421
based on the T-34-85 model.
Not install the stabilizer

138
00:18:06,562 --> 00:18:09,734
allowing it to shoot moving targets.

139
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,299
Bolster the armor and put
an amplifier on the engine.

140
00:18:13,404 --> 00:18:17,986
- How long?
- A month.

141
00:18:19,138 --> 00:18:21,628
In that case, two weeks.

142
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:26,306
General Smirnov, I
order you in charge of

143
00:18:26,411 --> 00:18:29,783
finding and destroying
the enemy tank.

144
00:18:30,506 --> 00:18:33,883
Let's call him the "White Tiger."

145
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,420
Take the new T-34
and assemble a crew.

146
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,100
- Yes, sir, Comrade Marshall.
- Who will work on this?

147
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:44,065
Deputy Chief of Army
Counterintelligence

148
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:46,415
Major Fedotov.

149
00:18:46,736 --> 00:18:50,732
- Choose the very best, Major.
- Yes, sir, Comrade Marshal.

150
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:57,327
- Ivan Ivanovich Naydenov.
- Yes, sir.

151
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:02,004
How do you feel? Recently
out of the hospital?

152
00:19:02,485 --> 00:19:04,664
Normal.

153
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,719
He heals as quickly as a dog.

154
00:19:07,824 --> 00:19:10,634
He got 95% body burn, it all healed.

155
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,331
Got shot in the leg, didn't even
need to leave the battlefield.

156
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:19,261
He was walking on the 3rd days. You
are somehow very special, Naydenov.

157
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,859
- Hard to kill.
- Probably, yes.

158
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:27,022
Still cannot remember anything?

159
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:31,367
First name, last name,
where are you from?

160
00:19:31,524 --> 00:19:34,203
No, I don't remember anything.

161
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,786
Your entire battalion was killed.

162
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:42,160
We tried to find out
your real name, but...

163
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:53,208
- Do you want to know it?
- No. Not really.

164
00:19:53,352 --> 00:19:57,980
So I was a Petrov or Stepanov,
now I became a Naydenov.

165
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:03,700
I remember that I am Russian, a tank
driver. What else do I need to know?

166
00:20:04,073 --> 00:20:08,278
But your family? You may
have had a mother, a father.

167
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:12,130
Maybe a wife, children.

168
00:20:12,698 --> 00:20:17,500
If I had them, they should have
already received notice of my death.

169
00:20:17,728 --> 00:20:20,971
The dead should not come back.

170
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,203
The dead should not
be with the living.

171
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:28,187
I remember how he shot at me.

172
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,707
The missile flew slowly
and directly at me.

173
00:20:38,347 --> 00:20:42,791
I saw it. It was slowly approaching.

174
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:47,429
I wanted to move. Take the
tank to the left or back.

175
00:20:47,535 --> 00:20:52,162
But I could not... I could
not move a single hand.

176
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:56,596
- You saw him?
- Yes, I saw him.

177
00:20:57,168 --> 00:21:02,551
The White Tiger. He burned
every single one of us.

178
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,036
What is he like, Naydenov?

179
00:21:07,544 --> 00:21:10,224
He is dead, Comrade Major.

180
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:15,066
What do you mean dead?
What are you talking about?

181
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:21,653
What is the tank like?
Its cannon, size, armor?

182
00:21:22,188 --> 00:21:26,232
Well, the tank... is just a tank.

183
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:30,892
Maybe a little bigger
than others, but dead.

184
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:35,019
There are always people
sitting in the tanks.

185
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,980
They are Nazis, of
course, but still people.

186
00:21:39,192 --> 00:21:41,787
We know that there
are people in there.

187
00:21:42,577 --> 00:21:46,852
People may get frightened or miss

188
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:50,441
or, if they are very brave,
gamble with their lives.

189
00:21:50,728 --> 00:21:52,930
But this one is dead.

190
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,639
He will never be afraid or miss.

191
00:21:58,325 --> 00:22:01,325
He will always do everything
right, without errors.

192
00:22:02,773 --> 00:22:06,699
Yeah, everything right.

193
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:11,785
There is no escape.

194
00:22:27,422 --> 00:22:31,489
I was told you are the best
tank driver in the army.

195
00:22:33,607 --> 00:22:38,474
I will request that you be awarded
the rank of Junior Lieutenant

196
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:44,602
and appointed commander of
the experimental tank T-34-85.

197
00:22:46,186 --> 00:22:48,718
It is not a standard
production machine.

198
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:52,164
It has increased armor protection
and an extra powerful engine.

199
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:58,478
The crew consists of 3 members:
a gunner, loader and you.

200
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,138
The mission...

201
00:23:03,776 --> 00:23:07,393
Find and destroy
the tank White Tiger.

202
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:36,897
Tank commander, Junior
Lieutenant Naydenov.

203
00:23:37,002 --> 00:23:40,497
Sergeant Kryuk, the best gunner.

204
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:46,381
Starshina Berdyev, loader.
Can load a cannon in 15 seconds

205
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,982
and is not affected by gasses that
accumulate in the dome after shooting.

206
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,522
- Did you select the crew?
- Yes, sir.

207
00:23:55,628 --> 00:23:59,121
- And these are the best of the best?
- The very best.

208
00:23:59,226 --> 00:24:05,131
Why? -Something about
their faces... is weird.

209
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:09,619
- What is weird?
- Well...

210
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:13,001
- Just weird.
- But they sit in a tank

211
00:24:13,107 --> 00:24:17,571
not dance on stage of Bolshoi Theater.
Tank commander and gunner, come here!

212
00:24:22,141 --> 00:24:24,788
Do you see a barn?

213
00:24:26,585 --> 00:24:29,268
- Yes, sir.
- How far away is it?

214
00:24:32,411 --> 00:24:35,703
- 600 meters.
-Really? 600?

215
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,109
- 640.
- Okay.

216
00:24:38,214 --> 00:24:42,403
Destroy the barn with
a maximum of two shots.

217
00:24:42,508 --> 00:24:45,081
- Yes, sir.
- Take your places.

218
00:26:17,402 --> 00:26:20,923
Yesterday he appeared
in the rear. Right here.

219
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:24,909
How he got here through
the swamp is not clear.

220
00:26:26,365 --> 00:26:28,922
But it is a fact.

221
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:36,053
He appeared, burned five tanks and four
self-propelled guns, and disappeared.

222
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:41,830
If you want, you can examine
the place, where this happened.

223
00:27:27,238 --> 00:27:30,467
He shot them from
those woods over there.

224
00:27:37,098 --> 00:27:40,764
Just beyond that
forest is a swamp bog.

225
00:27:43,716 --> 00:27:47,933
- A tank could not pass there.
- But he did. He is here.

226
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:53,119
Where? -Somewhere in the
woods here. He is hiding.

227
00:27:54,637 --> 00:27:59,287
He is not there. Yesterday
we searched the entire forest.

228
00:27:59,392 --> 00:28:02,396
Combed through every meter.

229
00:28:10,865 --> 00:28:12,956
He is there.

230
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:18,220
- What do you suggest?
- I will ambush him.

231
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:20,892
But I will need at
least one other tank.

232
00:28:20,893 --> 00:28:23,326
Preferably a T-34.

233
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:27,283
How do you know that
he is there? How?

234
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:33,468
He is there. I will
burn him, Comrade Major.

235
00:28:33,573 --> 00:28:36,388
Give me another tank.

236
00:28:39,283 --> 00:28:41,468
Sharipov!

237
00:28:51,286 --> 00:28:54,137
Go to Kutaisov's Brigade.

238
00:28:57,928 --> 00:29:01,703
You will give this to the
commander. I'll stay here.

239
00:29:04,215 --> 00:29:06,356
Comrade Major...

240
00:29:06,462 --> 00:29:09,866
Alexey, don't you get
a feeling that he...

241
00:29:10,007 --> 00:29:12,593
- Who?
- This Naydenov.

242
00:29:12,698 --> 00:29:15,264
- Is nuts!
- Enough, Sharipov!

243
00:29:15,369 --> 00:29:18,010
Execute the order!

244
00:30:00,987 --> 00:30:03,110
Give me some more.

245
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:39,212
At your disposal, Sergeant Slepov.

246
00:30:39,317 --> 00:30:44,161
Naydenov! Here is your commander
Junior Lieutenant Naydenov.

247
00:30:50,412 --> 00:30:54,747
Listen, stand over
there in that grove.

248
00:30:56,384 --> 00:31:00,868
When he appears, try to distract
him with fire and movement.

249
00:31:00,973 --> 00:31:03,219
- Understood.
- Execute.

250
00:31:03,324 --> 00:31:05,131
Yes, sir.

251
00:31:09,423 --> 00:31:11,598
Hey, Sergeant!

252
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:16,952
Keep the lids on the dome
opened. Do not close completely.

253
00:31:54,718 --> 00:31:58,666
- Major is coming.
- At ease.

254
00:31:59,053 --> 00:32:03,554
- Have some, Comrade Major.
- Thanks, I am not hungry.

255
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,305
Have some. There's enough for all.

256
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:13,251
- What about the commander?
- He seems not to eat.

257
00:32:13,357 --> 00:32:16,862
- What do you mean he doesn't eat?
- He'll only chew on some bread...

258
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:20,321
Wish I could run away
from him. I really do.

259
00:32:20,887 --> 00:32:24,687
Is he bewitched or something?
Shells do not hit him.

260
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:29,000
Maybe with someone like that Berdyev
and I will survive until the very end.

261
00:32:29,055 --> 00:32:31,369
What do you think?

262
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:34,986
Will you have some
alcohol, Comrade Major?

263
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:44,224
We, tankmen, usually do
not drink before battle.

264
00:32:44,568 --> 00:32:49,192
We should not. How many guys
burned down just because of alcohol!

265
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,920
But to Berdyev it is nothing.

266
00:32:53,026 --> 00:32:57,775
He is a loader and a
drunkard. Right, Berdyev?

267
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:25,668
- Do you think he will come?
- He will.

268
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,452
He is looking for me.

269
00:38:12,807 --> 00:38:15,160
Slepov!

270
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:47,626
You missed, Kryuk!

271
00:41:34,588 --> 00:41:39,204
Once he destroys your
T-34, we are finished.

272
00:41:48,328 --> 00:41:52,934
Listen to my command! We
are going to move back.

273
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,454
Then we'll come from the right side.
Shoot him just beneath the dome.

274
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,875
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

275
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,073
Let's go!

276
00:42:45,252 --> 00:42:47,675
Shoot, Kryuk! Shoot!

277
00:42:48,022 --> 00:42:51,549
- He's not there!
- What? Shoot!

278
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:53,915
I do not see him!

279
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:25,959
- Kryuk, get out!
- Where?

280
00:43:26,064 --> 00:43:29,477
Look around outside.
Assess the situation.

281
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,766
Yes, sir.

282
00:44:29,003 --> 00:44:33,042
Commander, he is not anywhere.

283
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:37,100
Not there at all. He's gone.

284
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:42,080
No, Kryuk. He is not gone.

285
00:44:44,953 --> 00:44:47,461
He is behind us.

286
00:45:06,964 --> 00:45:09,531
How could he have missed?

287
00:45:09,858 --> 00:45:13,686
From such a distance.
And from the back.

288
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:19,519
He could have turned us to porridge.
No one would even find our helmets.

289
00:45:19,624 --> 00:45:25,516
All right. Bring the
instructions and 27-32.

290
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,634
Are you injured?

291
00:45:54,236 --> 00:45:56,913
Where is he?

292
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:24,289
How was he able to get behind you?

293
00:46:25,258 --> 00:46:29,019
- You think I got scared?
- No, Naydenov.

294
00:46:29,124 --> 00:46:31,279
I do not think you got scared.

295
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,435
If I thought so, I
would have executed you.

296
00:46:37,351 --> 00:46:43,308
It's just that he outwitted
you. Slepov died in vain.

297
00:46:50,629 --> 00:46:53,956
You had reported to me that
the German "miracle tank"

298
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,801
was destroyed by our
experimental tank.

299
00:46:56,906 --> 00:46:59,070
Yes, sir. I reported that.

300
00:46:59,175 --> 00:47:03,584
In that case, why still no confirmation
of awarding the crew with military honors

301
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:06,116
for their accomplishment?

302
00:47:06,221 --> 00:47:09,597
Only one person was
witness to this battle...

303
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:13,891
Deputy Chief of Army
Counterintelligence Fedotov.

304
00:47:13,996 --> 00:47:17,685
He did not see the destruction
of the Tiger itself.

305
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:20,833
He saw how our tank hit it twice,

306
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:24,244
- then it disappeared.
- What does it mean, disappeared?

307
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:27,811
The battle took place at
the edge Karnilovskiy forest.

308
00:47:27,916 --> 00:47:32,388
Beyond it is swampland all around.
The Tiger seems to have sunk in it.

309
00:47:32,494 --> 00:47:36,709
Seems? So he may not have sunk?

310
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:41,313
After the battle, this Tiger
has not been seen anywhere.

311
00:47:43,178 --> 00:47:45,714
Here are his tracks.

312
00:47:54,364 --> 00:47:57,141
Here he was going backwards.

313
00:48:07,674 --> 00:48:10,469
The tracks end here.

314
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:16,059
- And how is one to understand this?
- Assuming that

315
00:48:16,164 --> 00:48:22,015
he passed through the swamp. It
is unclear how, but he passed.

316
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:25,199
In that case, on the other side

317
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,568
his tracks would
continue, but they do not.

318
00:48:27,674 --> 00:48:30,790
Soldiers have searched
every inch out there.

319
00:48:30,896 --> 00:48:33,793
No, Alexey. He sank.

320
00:48:33,993 --> 00:48:37,932
We cannot pull him out from
swamp waters, but he is there.

321
00:48:42,973 --> 00:48:46,432
Naydenov keeps saying the
contrary. That he got away.

322
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:49,488
Naydenov has gone nuts.

323
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:53,869
Listen, Alexey. This
happens, you know it.

324
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:58,843
In this war many people have lost
theirs minds. Many more will lose it yet.

325
00:49:01,584 --> 00:49:04,803
Do you know he is praying to God?

326
00:49:05,641 --> 00:49:08,638
- To who?
- His Tank God.

327
00:49:08,743 --> 00:49:11,667
For him, there is a Tank God.

328
00:49:34,129 --> 00:49:36,471
Hello!

329
00:49:37,612 --> 00:49:42,169
- What wind brings you here?
- Fair wind. How are you?

330
00:49:42,378 --> 00:49:46,145
- Not bad.
- Where can I find Naydenov?

331
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:49,204
See his tank.

332
00:50:13,181 --> 00:50:15,850
Sergeant Kryuk.

333
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:34,808
Kryuk, if you bring a woman
into the tank one more time

334
00:50:34,914 --> 00:50:39,102
I will personally kill you
on the spot. Clear? -Yes, sir.

335
00:50:44,902 --> 00:50:46,751
Stop!

336
00:50:47,994 --> 00:50:50,748
What is this, Berdyev?

337
00:50:52,053 --> 00:50:55,541
Starshina Berdyev, I am
asking what you have in there?

338
00:50:55,647 --> 00:50:58,847
It's German schnapps,
Comrade Captain.

339
00:50:58,952 --> 00:51:02,414
He found it yesterday in the
basement of a neighboring village.

340
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:06,354
- Two barrels.
- Berdyev, were you not warned

341
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:10,019
that Germans purposefully
leave behind poisoned schnapps?

342
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:13,176
To inflict losses in our manpower.

343
00:51:16,146 --> 00:51:18,436
Is it tasty?

344
00:51:19,278 --> 00:51:22,020
Kryuk where is Naydenov?

345
00:51:22,905 --> 00:51:25,801
- With the tanks.
- With what tanks?

346
00:51:25,923 --> 00:51:28,525
The damaged ones. Not far from here.

347
00:51:30,989 --> 00:51:34,838
This one is ours. Burned in 1941.

348
00:52:20,213 --> 00:52:22,108
Naydenov!

349
00:52:29,816 --> 00:52:33,695
Naydenov, get up! A senior
officer is addressing you.

350
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,526
Leave it, Captain!

351
00:52:51,556 --> 00:52:53,996
Naydenov.

352
00:53:09,925 --> 00:53:12,906
White Tiger.

353
00:53:15,418 --> 00:53:21,905
- What about the White Tiger?
- He did not sink. He is there.

354
00:53:22,011 --> 00:53:26,968
- Did he fly over the marshes?
- Wait, Sharipov.

355
00:53:27,947 --> 00:53:33,878
- Why do you think that he did not sink?
- He left. To prepare.

356
00:53:34,012 --> 00:53:36,149
- He is waiting.
- For what?

357
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:39,896
- What is he waiting for?
- When we begin the offensive.

358
00:53:45,261 --> 00:53:49,878
- Did the Tank God tell you that?
- Yes.

359
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:57,577
And this God, where is he?

360
00:53:58,231 --> 00:54:02,029
In the sky. In the clouds.

361
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,216
He has a throne. And he sits on it.

362
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:11,867
Around him are all the tanks
who were killed in battle.

363
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:16,481
What does he look like? This God?

364
00:54:17,109 --> 00:54:22,056
He is in overalls, in tank helmet...

365
00:54:23,456 --> 00:54:27,471
He has a T-34... Gold.

366
00:54:28,511 --> 00:54:34,669
When he sits inside it there
is thunder and lightning.

367
00:54:39,482 --> 00:54:41,950
You see?

368
00:54:52,801 --> 00:54:58,218
- He helps you in battle?
- He does.

369
00:55:00,271 --> 00:55:05,327
I can hear tanks. All tanks speak.

370
00:55:05,995 --> 00:55:09,252
Only no one else
hears them, but I do.

371
00:55:09,411 --> 00:55:13,206
They warn me when shells are fired,

372
00:55:13,312 --> 00:55:17,381
so I can get away in time.
That's how they help me.

373
00:55:19,634 --> 00:55:25,822
They want me to live.
They want me to...

374
00:55:26,689 --> 00:55:29,903
burn the White Tiger.

375
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,007
To take revenge.

376
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:38,566
- I told you he was crazy!
- You did.

377
00:55:38,671 --> 00:55:41,218
- Do you understand now?
- I understand.

378
00:55:41,323 --> 00:55:43,657
This team should be disbanded.

379
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,713
Naydenov should be sent
to hospital for treatment.

380
00:55:46,818 --> 00:55:50,854
Kryuk and Berdyev placed in other teams.
They've gotten completely out of hand.

381
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,198
Why are you silent?

382
00:55:59,658 --> 00:56:03,772
- What do you think, Alexey?
- I don't think anything. Go!

383
00:56:12,095 --> 00:56:14,745
Yes, I served at the
headquarters of Inspector General

384
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:17,437
of German armored tank groups.

385
00:56:17,543 --> 00:56:20,305
How did you get captured?

386
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:31,572
I was sent to accompany
a group of experts

387
00:56:31,678 --> 00:56:35,207
from the Ministry of
Weapons and Ammunition.

388
00:56:38,765 --> 00:56:41,261
I was captured by your scouts.

389
00:56:41,366 --> 00:56:44,451
What can you tell us
about the tank White Tiger?

390
00:56:52,362 --> 00:56:55,963
All around there are
legends about this tank.

391
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:05,797
In Wehrmacht it is cause
for more fear than hope.

392
00:57:15,058 --> 00:57:18,150
But, believe me,
during all my time at HQ

393
00:57:18,255 --> 00:57:21,466
I have never come
across a single document

394
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:25,097
that would at least indirectly be
connected with this White Tiger.

395
00:57:25,202 --> 00:57:29,955
Maybe it has been created?
And serves Hitler personally?

396
00:57:37,283 --> 00:57:39,765
No, this is impossible.

397
00:57:41,786 --> 00:57:45,389
I am absolutely sure that
such a tank does not exist.

398
00:57:54,923 --> 00:57:59,447
Now what do you think?

399
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:07,813
What I think is not possible.

400
01:01:16,042 --> 01:01:20,498
Tight formation. One
battery can burn them all.

401
01:01:20,603 --> 01:01:25,001
Comrade Commander, we have
cleared all land in 10 km radius.

402
01:01:25,106 --> 01:01:28,700
Not a single Nazi
before the crossing.

403
01:03:54,636 --> 01:03:58,328
Cleared? You motherfucker!
Who is shooting? From where?

404
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:01,155
- Comrade Commander...
- Give order to withdraw. Fast!

405
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:03,144
Yes, sir!

406
01:04:03,416 --> 01:04:07,506
What is that? Him?

407
01:04:08,717 --> 01:04:12,088
Yes, Comrade Commander. It is him.

408
01:05:37,268 --> 01:05:39,362
Retreat!

409
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:26,310
- Can't see a thing.
- Where are we?

410
01:06:26,999 --> 01:06:31,200
At the Devil's home.
At his birthday party.

411
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:53,473
Kryuk, see the barn on the right?

412
01:10:55,358 --> 01:10:58,597
- Yes, sir.
- Shoot into its wall with antitank

413
01:10:58,702 --> 01:11:01,333
- aim at the dome level.
- Yes, sir.

414
01:11:42,347 --> 01:11:45,759
- The demon is finished!
- This was not him.

415
01:11:46,695 --> 01:11:49,415
This was a T-4.

416
01:13:05,837 --> 01:13:10,553
- We have arrived.
-Yes, Berdyev.

417
01:13:10,688 --> 01:13:13,463
Now we'll dance.

418
01:14:03,109 --> 01:14:05,001
Done!

419
01:14:58,637 --> 01:15:04,147
- His dome is damaged!
- Finish him off, Kryuk!

420
01:15:54,435 --> 01:15:56,883
Our cannon exploded!

421
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,115
- In his office?
- Yes, sir.

422
01:18:06,246 --> 01:18:08,366
Tell him.

423
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:26,105
Come in.

424
01:18:38,208 --> 01:18:40,764
- Hello, Comrade Commander.
- Hello.

425
01:18:40,869 --> 01:18:43,004
- Want to eat?
- No, thank you.

426
01:18:43,109 --> 01:18:45,934
- What about a drink?
- A drink I will not refuse.

427
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,096
Sit.

428
01:19:15,753 --> 01:19:17,844
He disappeared.

429
01:19:18,675 --> 01:19:23,201
- As though vanished into thin air.
- But he burned.

430
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:27,710
Burned a lot. And Germans...

431
01:19:27,746 --> 01:19:31,196
their crews don't sit inside
burning tanks, you know that.

432
01:19:31,232 --> 01:19:36,973
- They had to abandon it.
- I think...

433
01:19:38,376 --> 01:19:41,300
he has no crew.

434
01:19:42,963 --> 01:19:46,308
That is the situation,
Comrade Commander.

435
01:19:49,315 --> 01:19:54,535
Are you serious? Maybe
I poured you too much?

436
01:19:59,347 --> 01:20:03,514
After the battle I asked Naydenov

437
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:07,268
how he was able to predict,
when the Tiger will shoot.

438
01:20:07,868 --> 01:20:13,734
And do you know what he said?
That his tank had warned him.

439
01:20:14,526 --> 01:20:17,376
That tanks sense when
they will be fired at

440
01:20:17,481 --> 01:20:22,058
and they warn their drivers. Only
drivers usually don't hear them.

441
01:20:31,437 --> 01:20:33,854
And he does hear?

442
01:20:34,087 --> 01:20:38,063
Are you in your right
mind? He's hearing tanks!

443
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:43,498
And how else would you
explain his uncanny ability

444
01:20:43,603 --> 01:20:46,442
to feel the presence of the Tiger?

445
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:50,100
How could he know that he will
once again reemerge from the swamp?

446
01:20:50,143 --> 01:20:52,813
Waiting in ambush for our attack?

447
01:20:52,918 --> 01:20:57,024
You said Naydenov hates
this Tiger with a passion

448
01:20:57,129 --> 01:21:00,045
- because he had destroyed his tank?
- Yes.

449
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:03,996
Why then, if he hears
the warning of his tank,

450
01:21:04,055 --> 01:21:06,817
he did not hear it back then?

451
01:21:06,958 --> 01:21:10,383
Back then he did not
yet have this ability.

452
01:21:11,091 --> 01:21:17,218
This ability appeared
after he burned.

453
01:21:17,542 --> 01:21:22,814
What do you mean "burned"?
What are you saying?

454
01:21:23,336 --> 01:21:27,417
After 90% body burns
people do not survive.

455
01:21:27,876 --> 01:21:33,053
Naydenov also burned to death.
Burned and was reborn again.

456
01:21:33,158 --> 01:21:38,752
As a different person.
Ideal war machine.

457
01:21:38,858 --> 01:21:43,100
He is the incarnation of war.
Just like the White Tiger.

458
01:21:52,462 --> 01:21:56,008
So, Alexey Nikolaevich,
you believe in mysticism?

459
01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:03,375
In what I am saying
there is no more mysticism

460
01:22:03,795 --> 01:22:08,074
than in Darwin's theory of
evolution of living organisms

461
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:11,964
influenced by the conditions
of their existence.

462
01:22:13,025 --> 01:22:16,344
Or do you find Darwin's
theory mysticism?

463
01:22:17,082 --> 01:22:22,000
I don't know about Darwin. But
I believe in God and the Devil.

464
01:22:22,151 --> 01:22:27,398
In war I started to believe in it.
Although I am a Communist, just like you.

465
01:22:27,503 --> 01:22:30,200
Remember, Major, my army is going

466
01:22:30,253 --> 01:22:32,994
at the speed of 50 km
per day towards Berlin

467
01:22:33,099 --> 01:22:35,766
and nothing will stop it!

468
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:44,013
Regarding Darwin, I will tell you
this... You are tired, exhausted.

469
01:22:44,119 --> 01:22:47,323
Hence such nonsense fills your mind.

470
01:22:47,428 --> 01:22:49,925
I'll give you leave for 10 days.

471
01:22:49,926 --> 01:22:52,422
Go rest, come to your senses.

472
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,804
When you return, we will take Berlin.

473
01:23:30,893 --> 01:23:33,030
Stop, please!

474
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:42,868
Stand here.

475
01:23:55,001 --> 01:23:57,187
Come in.

476
01:24:01,058 --> 01:24:03,620
Your seats are here.

477
01:24:59,275 --> 01:25:02,948
Ask the German representatives

478
01:25:03,053 --> 01:25:08,900
are they familiar with the Act of
Complete and Unconditional Surrender?

479
01:25:18,772 --> 01:25:20,943
Yes.

480
01:25:31,428 --> 01:25:37,236
Do the representatives of
the German Supreme Command

481
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:42,044
agree to sign the Act of Complete
and Unconditional Surrender?

482
01:25:51,195 --> 01:25:53,361
Yes.

483
01:27:03,597 --> 01:27:06,529
The Delegation of Germany is offered

484
01:27:06,634 --> 01:27:10,731
to sign the Act of
Unconditional Surrender.

485
01:27:24,039 --> 01:27:26,704
Let them come over here.

486
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:16,509
- Would you like wine?
- Yes, white.

487
01:29:18,356 --> 01:29:23,408
- We have Tokaji wine.
- No, Tokaji is too sweet.

488
01:29:23,513 --> 01:29:26,033
Then red.

489
01:29:45,109 --> 01:29:50,163
The roast is not bad. Interesting,
where did they get all of this?

490
01:29:50,269 --> 01:29:54,677
I suppose from a restaurant.
Looks like this is from Schlemmer.

491
01:30:04,723 --> 01:30:07,533
Have you been there, Field Marshal?

492
01:30:09,969 --> 01:30:15,707
- Where?
- Schlemmer.

493
01:30:16,727 --> 01:30:19,058
In the restaurant.

494
01:30:23,706 --> 01:30:27,069
No, never.

495
01:30:46,082 --> 01:30:48,576
Come here.

496
01:31:04,173 --> 01:31:06,614
Let's go.

497
01:31:16,407 --> 01:31:18,928
What is this?

498
01:31:19,913 --> 01:31:23,613
Fresh frozen strawberries
with whipped cream.

499
01:31:51,758 --> 01:31:57,997
You know, for the first time in my
life, I eat fresh frozen strawberries
with whipped cream.

500
01:31:59,610 --> 01:32:01,728
What?

501
01:32:02,118 --> 01:32:06,588
- Did I say something funny?
- No, nothing.

502
01:32:06,694 --> 01:32:11,233
Sorry, Field Marshal.
Absolutely nothing.

503
01:37:32,138 --> 01:37:34,234
Naydenov!

504
01:37:39,913 --> 01:37:44,340
Sorry. I did not hear you coming...

505
01:37:44,837 --> 01:37:47,200
I was fixing the tank.

506
01:37:48,419 --> 01:37:52,139
- I see you are in full combat gear.
- Yes, sir.

507
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:57,096
Even more than that.
I loaded 14 extra ones.

508
01:37:59,216 --> 01:38:03,861
- Have a smoke.
- German?

509
01:38:06,279 --> 01:38:08,510
French.

510
01:38:21,710 --> 01:38:26,113
Where is the crew?

511
01:38:26,218 --> 01:38:31,350
- Celebrating the victory.
-Yes, of course.

512
01:38:32,427 --> 01:38:36,619
Those devils! They'll
drink themselves to death.

513
01:38:49,388 --> 01:38:52,045
The war is over, Naydenov.

514
01:38:54,784 --> 01:38:57,628
Do you hear me, Ivan?

515
01:39:00,698 --> 01:39:04,130
The war is over. The End.

516
01:39:11,454 --> 01:39:14,017
Until I burn him,

517
01:39:14,122 --> 01:39:17,920
the war will not
end, Comrade Colonel.

518
01:39:23,915 --> 01:39:29,373
He is gone! After the Battle
of the Vistula he is gone.

519
01:39:29,887 --> 01:39:33,328
He is waiting. Waiting...

520
01:39:35,232 --> 01:39:39,857
He will 20 years, 50, maybe a 100.

521
01:39:40,956 --> 01:39:43,341
Then he will come out.

522
01:39:44,288 --> 01:39:46,691
He must be burned.

523
01:39:53,197 --> 01:39:56,353
You know that this must be done.

524
01:41:04,917 --> 01:41:08,426
<i>We know each other
too long and too well.</i>

525
01:41:08,531 --> 01:41:13,410
<i>Too much connects us for me
to hide my thoughts from you.</i>

526
01:41:13,716 --> 01:41:16,938
<i>The war has been
lost. I know it. </i>

527
01:41:18,913 --> 01:41:23,374
<i>Not just lost. Europe
has been destroyed.</i>

528
01:41:24,178 --> 01:41:29,400
But can you imagine what
will happen tomorrow?

529
01:41:30,864 --> 01:41:36,400
Miserable Germany. It will be
blamed for all the deadly sins.

530
01:41:37,423 --> 01:41:42,400
The German people will be
to blame for everything.

531
01:41:42,819 --> 01:41:46,500
Thousands of books will be written.

532
01:41:46,990 --> 01:41:51,797
Thousands of ugly
documents will be found.

533
01:41:53,523 --> 01:41:57,571
Hundreds of memoirs invented.

534
01:41:58,129 --> 01:42:02,390
And we, Germany and I,

535
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:07,207
we will stand before the world

536
01:42:07,477 --> 01:42:12,500
as the sole source of evil of all
mankind, as the personification of Hell.

537
01:42:13,734 --> 01:42:17,487
And we simply found
the courage to do that

538
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,727
what all Europe had fantasized about.

539
01:42:20,936 --> 01:42:24,973
We said, "If you are
thinking about it,

540
01:42:25,079 --> 01:42:28,229
let's finally do it."

541
01:42:29,364 --> 01:42:33,241
It's like a surgical operation.

542
01:42:33,451 --> 01:42:37,185
First there is pain,
but then the body heals.

543
01:42:37,475 --> 01:42:41,886
Have we not realized the secret dream

544
01:42:41,992 --> 01:42:44,391
every European inhabitant?

545
01:42:44,496 --> 01:42:48,079
Was that not the cause
of all our victories?

546
01:42:48,184 --> 01:42:54,122
Everyone knew that, about which they
were afraid to tell even their wives,

547
01:42:54,228 --> 01:42:59,796
we had declared clearly and openly,
as befits a powerful and united nation.

548
01:43:00,735 --> 01:43:04,376
They had always disliked Jews.

549
01:43:04,654 --> 01:43:11,864
They always feared that dark
and gloomy country in the east.

550
01:43:11,969 --> 01:43:17,887
That centaur who is savage
and foreign for Europe, Russia.

551
01:43:18,949 --> 01:43:23,318
I said, "Let's simply
solve these two problems."

552
01:43:23,598 --> 01:43:26,922
Solve them once and for all.

553
01:43:27,173 --> 01:43:30,527
Did we invent something new? No.

554
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:35,216
We simply brought
clarity to all the matters

555
01:43:35,414 --> 01:43:40,550
for which Europe wanted
clarity and that is all.

556
01:43:40,958 --> 01:43:44,341
Ever since the Earth
rotates around the sun...

557
01:43:44,447 --> 01:43:48,775
While there exist heat and
cold, storms and sunlight...

558
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:51,945
so long will exist the struggle,

559
01:43:52,028 --> 01:43:56,100
including struggle
between people and nations.

560
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:01,812
If people had remained in
paradise, they would have rotted.

561
01:44:02,985 --> 01:44:07,630
Humanity has become what it
is, thanks to the struggle.

562
01:44:08,761 --> 01:44:12,300
War is a natural, normal thing.

563
01:44:13,984 --> 01:44:19,400
War is going on always and everywhere.
It has no beginning and no end.

564
01:44:21,327 --> 01:44:23,911
War is life itself.

565
01:44:25,438 --> 01:44:29,235
War is the starting point.
