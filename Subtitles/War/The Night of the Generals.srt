The entire quarter

We shall take a leaf
from the fisherman's book.

160

First, we'll mark out a wide perimeter, then
we'll start combing the outlying streets.

of curiosity,

what do you feel is the exact
purpose of this exercise?

You've read the memorandum.
Oh, yes. Yes, I have...

the memorandum say?

205
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,918
That phase one is intended
to intimidate the population

to find and arrest resistance.

207

Then that is the exact purpose
of the exercise.

00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,115

But am I to understand that if there
is resistance during phase one,

211

you would then go to phase two
and even to phase three,

the destruction of the entire city?

00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,038
Now, your cousin suggested
that you join us here at headquarters,

340
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,437
but I should think you'd be anxious
to get back to the fighting.

341
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,151
No?
No, sir.

342
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,591
General, what he really means is...
Leave us, sergeant.

343
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,952
I, um...

344
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,310
I don't seem
to understand you, corporal.

345
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,592
I want to survive, sir.
I want to live through the war.

346
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,109
Well, naturally. We all do.

347
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,915
But we are soldiers, we must fight.
Yes, sir. And I have.

348
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,519
And you don't want to go back.

349
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,554
Is this the " reincarnation
of Siegfried"?

350
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,595
I'm sorry, sir,
but I have a horror of death.

351
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,836
Even in a good cause?

352
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,958
Let me see now...

353
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,914
According to your papers,
in civilian life you were

354
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,395
a student at Dresden?

355
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,239
Music conservatory,
yes, sir. I studied piano.

356
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,560
Music, piano, yes. Yes.

357
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,389
Yes. I think I have
an assignment for you.

358
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,149
But one which requires great courage.
Only a man who has killed...

359
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,191
How many was it? Let me see.

360
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,915
Yes, 40 Russians single-handed,
would be equal to the task.

361
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,395
Now, what about Chopin,
wasn't he Polish?

362
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,158
Didn't he write the <i>Polonaises</i>?

363
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,828
Can you play them?
Yes, madam.

364
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,792
You don't sound
very enthusiastic.

365
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,991
Well, madam,
they were patriotic pieces,

366
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,997
celebrating the glory
of Poland.

367
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,794
Well, the glory of Poland isn't
precisely what we're here to celebrate.

368
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,036
No, madam. So I thought
that perhaps we might play...

369
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,673
Wagner.

370
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,599
I remember the Führer saying to me
after a performance of <i>Parsifal</i>,

371
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,791
"There's no such thing
as too much Wagner. "

372
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,592
After <i>Parsifal</i>?

373
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,439
I must say, it's unusual
to find a fighting man

374
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,995
who also knows about music.
Thank you, madam.

375
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,634
Oh, no, don't thank me,
wait until I've thanked you.

376
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,035
And I won't until
after the soiree.

377
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,276
[###]

378
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,758
I dislike being a bore, major.
You never bore me, Engel.

379
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,918
But I can't help wondering
what you're trying to prove.

380
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,839
Just what do you think you're doing?
My job.

381
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,235
But if you say anything to
any of them, he'll know...

382
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,714
The murderer will know
that you're after him.

383
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,638
That's the point of the exercise.

384
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,400
Good evening, sergeant.
Sir.

385
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,953
But look, sir, why do you care
who killed that bitch?

386
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,435
She's better off dead anyway.

387
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,950
Have you ever heard
of the Eumenides?

388
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,276
The what?
Greek mythology.

389
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,029
A number of disagreeable ladies,
sometimes known as the Furies.

390
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,357
They believe that spilled blood
calls out for vengeance.

391
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,437
That's how justice began.

392
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,269
Well, we don't want it to end,
do we, just because there's a war on?

393
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,591
Wait for me here.
I'm afraid I won't be long.

394
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,712
Mad.

395
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,879
MAN:
Grau.

396
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,630
Colonel Mannheim.
What on earth are you doing here?

397
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,193
You must be out of your mind.

398
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,517
If the generals won't see me,
I must come here to see them.

399
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,950
Well, God help you, Grau.
I won't.

400
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,152
Better have some champagne.
You'll need it.

401
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,031
You may be right, sir.

402
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,952
General Tanz, to my mind
you're a model man in every respect.

403
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,276
Except one.
You've not married.

404
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,109
May I ask why not?
No opportunity. Greatly regret it.

405
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,709
Well, perhaps you've allowed
opportunities to slip by.

406
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,151
My dear, General Tanz is a young man
whose life has been spent as a soldier.

407
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,238
His generation has been denied
the pleasures of domesticity.

408
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,000
We live in a period which makes
great demands upon us.

409
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,397
Consequently, there is little time for
what is commonly known as private life.

410
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,034
Quite right. Champagne, general?
Water.

411
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,152
Water?
A glass of water for General Tanz.

412
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,396
Ah. Here comes Ulrike.

413
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,556
You remember her from Berlin.
Good evening, general.

414
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,955
She's been with me over
a year now, as a soldier.

415
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,435
An excellent soldier.
Thank you, Father.

416
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,030
I must say, I still find it hard to get
used to the idea of young girls in the army.

417
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,153
We're building a new world order, and women
should not be exempt from playing their part.

418
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,998
I knew you would understand,
general.

419
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,270
Ulrike has now decided
to become a nurse

420
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,836
in a military hospital run
by an order of nuns in Bavaria.

421
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,792
We're very proud of our girl.

422
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,877
Tell me, general, is it true
that in the battle of Leningrad

423
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,550
you used frozen bodies instead
of sandbags for your artillery?

424
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,797
The story is exaggerated.

425
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,638
Oh, I am sorry.

426
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,877
Some soldiers lie and rot
in the battlefield.

427
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,550
I thought it most imaginative, putting
the dead to work, you might say.

428
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,239
Nobody rots with me.

429
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,196
Your water, general.

430
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,958
Thank you.

431
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,353
My compliments. I liked the bit
about the frozen bodies.

432
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,278
Oh, thank you, general.
Be careful.

433
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,631
Ulrike has a most original
way of expressing herself.

434
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,354
Needless to say, I shall
miss not having her with me.

435
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,232
Then why let her go?

436
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,193
Come along, general,
let's have some supper.

437
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,152
You'll join us, too,
Kahlenberge?

438
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,999
Courage.
Is not enough.

439
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,996
How dare you speak like that
to General Tanz?

440
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,191
It serves you right, Mother,
for what you're doing to me.

441
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,233
Whatever I do is for your own good.
I think only of you.

442
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,908
Only of me?
You have changed.

443
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,350
When did I begin
to interest you so much?

444
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,152
Good evening.

445
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,238
You've become vicious.
Yes, it's the war, Mother.

446
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,829
Well, the nuns will soon
improve your manners.

447
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,314
Suppose I refuse to go?

448
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,354
You will be ordered to go. I have seen
to that already. You have no choice.

449
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,199
You really are a terrible
woman, Mother.

450
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,789
I suppose we deserve
each other.

451
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,228
Colonel Mannheim!

452
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,273
Good evening.
Yes, I'd love to dance with you.

453
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,429
In my memoirs,
I keep a record of everything.

454
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,712
Yours will be the place of honor
in the Warsaw chapter.

455
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,876
GRAU:
General von Seidlitz-Gabler?

456
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,311
Sir.
Oh, yes, you are Major...?

457
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,193
Grau, Intelligence.
Under Colonel Mannheim.

458
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,038
I tried to see you today.

459
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,516
In fact, I tried to see each of you,
without much success, I'm afraid.

460
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,472
I'm sorry, major, but general
officers are sometimes busy, you know?

461
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,795
Of course.

462
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,479
What was it you wanted
to see us about?

463
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,955
Last night,
a prostitute was murdered.

464
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,676
A prostitute? That's an
occupational hazard, isn't it?

465
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,712
When you hear the details, I'm sure
you'll agree it's a unique case.

466
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,070
Unique?
You can't be serious.

467
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,556
We live in an age in which bodies lie
around streets like cobblestones.

468
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,239
What's so unique
about this case?

469
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,953
All right, all right,
come to the point, major.

470
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,115
Last night, a woman
was murdered.

471
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,233
Yes, general, in Bulkowa Street,
number 27, fourth-floor apartment,

472
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,036
Maria Kupiecka, a prostitute,
also one of our agents.

473
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,630
She was stabbed to death most
brutally. Cut to pieces, in fact.

474
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,230
A charming story.
But what has that to do with us?

475
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,955
Preliminary investigation has
established that each of you was...

476
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,277
well, unaccounted
for last night.

477
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,914
To whom should we be
accountable, major?

478
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,236
I fail to see what my...

479
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,718
What our movements should have to do
with you or with this woman's death.

480
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,753
Well, the murderer was seen
leaving the woman's room.

481
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,951
In that case,
you must know who he is.

482
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,390
Not exactly. The face was not
visible, but the uniform was.

483
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,478
It was the uniform
of a German officer.

484
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,353
In fact, a German general.

485
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,589
This is a serious charge.
I hope you know what you're doing.

486
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,789
Oh, yes, sir, my duty.

487
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,592
Then consider your duty
done, major. Good night.

488
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,110
Are you, by any chance,
using perfume?

489
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,551
I occasionally use a strong
eau de cologne after shaving.

490
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,432
Good night, sir.

491
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,758
I will, of course, want to see each of
you tomorrow, if I may, in line of duty.

492
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,632
It is quite possible
we've been misled,

493
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,991
but we don't want to leave
any loose ends dangling, do we?

494
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,078
Until tomorrow.
Good night, generals.

495
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,835
Astonishing behavior!

496
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,110
Who invited him?
Not I.

497
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,153
Socially, Major Grau
has not been a success.

498
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,918
I'm sorry, general.
I should have had him arrested.

499
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,510
Why? He was merely
doing his duty.

500
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,913
Yes.

501
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,633
Well...

502
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,356
Now, there are some officers
I should like to present to you.

503
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,151
Some sauerbraten, general?

504
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,790
Make yourself comfortable,
inspector.

505
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,877
This is my third restaurant
in Berlin.

506
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,993
That's if you count the sausage shop I had
down by the station right after the war.

507
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,236
We were really on our arse then.

508
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,876
Now look, Germany is booming.
We made it.

509
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,594
Well, come along, inspector,
do sit down.

510
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,590
One large Munchen, please.

511
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,556
Now, then, you asked me
about General Kahlenberge.

512
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,150
Well, I don't suppose there was
anyone who knew him better than me.

513
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,278
Hartmann's doing
a good job, isn't he, sir?

514
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,074
Yes. What?

515
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,511
Oh, yes! Apparently.

516
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,836

<i>as I said before,</i>

517
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,395
<i>I haven't seen Hartmann</i>
<i>since the war. </i>

518
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,478
<i>Don't want to see him,</i>
<i>after what he did. </i>

519
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,992
<i>But I'll say one thing, he had the most</i>
<i>extraordinary effect on women. </i>

520
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,599
<i>I don't know why. </i>

521
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,872
<i>Well, he wasn't what you'd call</i>
<i>really handsome. </i>

522
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,559
<i>Too skinny. </i>

523
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,548
<i>But whatever it was he had,</i>

524

529
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,354
<i>Oh, worry, I didn't mean that</i>
<i>about the Allies. </i>

530
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,915
<i>After all, where would we be now</i>
<i>without Americans?</i>

531
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,430
Nice.
I'd forgotten how nice.

532
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,517
Would you say there
were no girls in Russia?

533
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,190
Girls? I was too scared.

534
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,438
I'm hopeless when I'm scared.

535
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,437
Well, it's a good thing
I don't scare you, isn't it?

536
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,077
Yes, it's just that this room
makes me nervous.

537
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,429
Nervous?
Mm.

538
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,710
Oh, you have no sense of history.

539
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,434
Do you realize this used to be
the bed of the king of Poland.

540
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,755
Did it really?
Mm-hm.

541
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,234
It's like sleeping on the floor.

542
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,793
It's freezing in here.

543
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,197
Ah, but the king and the queen
never slept. They just made love.

544
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,356
They were never cold.

545
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,638
Do you like the war?

546
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,999
Do I like the war?

547
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,395
Good God, no. Do you?

548
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,958
If it weren't for the war, I'd be on the
marriage circuit now, living on some army post,

549
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,549
making conversation
with dreary young officers.

550
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,672
Instead of making love
with dreary young corporals.

551
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,270
Oh, not dreary. Not at all.

552
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,315
In fact, the best so far.
Oh?

553
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,080

No.

Only heroes like you.

555
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,872
Just think, all this bravery
in my arms.

556
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,355
It must be very inspiring.

557
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,196
What's the matter?

558
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,038
You know, we mustn't like
each other too much.

559
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,391
Why? Because I'm a corporal
and you're a general's daughter?

560
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,115
No. It's because...

561
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,557
It's a man, a girl, a war.

562
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,952
Two boys I knew
are already dead in Russia.

563
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,878
It's funny.

00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,355

you feel just like them to me.

565
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,152

they were firing at me.

Well, what do you think it's like?
Terrible.

580
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,318
Yes.

Probably not.

I'm a fraud.
Impossible.

It's as simple as that.

590
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,835
Then, I've no idea how, I was hit.

591
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,953
It was like a door slamming in
my head, and I thought I was dead.

592
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,151
Next thing I remember
waking up in the hospital

593
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,954
and there was this general
congratulating me

on having killed 40 Russians
single-handed.

595

You see, they were all killed
that day, the whole company.

596
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,993
Everyone was killed except me,
and I suppose

597
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,317
it didn't look too good in dispatches,
a whole company being wiped out,

598
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,318

to make a hero of the survivor.

Well, that's a lovely story.

I don't trust him.

620
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,311
Naturally, in the field,
he must use his discretion.

He has no discretion.
He is ruthless.

Now, now, you exaggerate.

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,278

one should prove to be a failure.

Well, if the Poles, the Jews
try to retaliate.

no decaying old men or children.

842
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,718
Yes, sir. We are making good
progress, General Kahlenberge and I.

843
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,434
After all, it may be your
last chance to see Paris.

844
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,438
It may be anyone's
last chance. Such a pity.

845
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,789
A necessity.

846
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,877
But of course.
Of course it's necessary.

847
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,230
Stern measures, the only thing
people respect.

848
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,317
All I'm suggesting is that
you leave everything to us.

849
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,478
A commander does not...
And your excellent Colonel Sandauer.

850
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,148
We've arranged a suite
for you at the... Kahlenberge?

851
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,112
At your hotel.
At the Excelsior.

852
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,915
You'll have a car, a driver and
whatever else strikes your fancy.

853
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:01,238
One must relax occasionally, general.
I can't afford to.

854
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,399
You give me no alternative
but to compel you to enjoy yourself.

855
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,272
Must I order you?

856
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,870
Because if I must,
I'm afraid I shall have to.

857
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,433
Yes, sir.

858
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,949
Evidently, you are not
ready for me.

859
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,078
Very well.

860
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,874
I shall devote one day
to seeing the city.

861
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:24,517
I shall return to headquarters at
0800 hours on the morning of the 19th.

862
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,870
Heil, Hitler.

863
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,275
GABLER:
Heil Hitler.

864
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,153
Well, that wasn't so bad.
You now have one day's grace.

865
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,191
We need two, until the 20th.

866
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,879
Come and have dinner with
me and Eleanore tomorrow.

867
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,513
Ulrike's arriving.
This is bad luck.

868
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,429
Naturally, she forgot to say
which train she'd be on.

869
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,272
I assume you are with us now.
In spirit, of course, but...

870
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,358
You'll have to make up
your mind. Soon.

871
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,872
Making up one's mind is one
thing, speaking it is another.

872
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,877
You worry too much.

873
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,313
Patience is one of
the few virtues that I possess.

874
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,719
At ease.

875
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,754
Sergeant, get me the military
governor's office on the telephone.

876
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,631
Corporal?
Sir.

877
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,717
I have an assignment for you.

878
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,433
Come in.

879
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,150
Get me the military
governor's office.

880
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,998
For General Kahlenberge.

881
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,236
You're to stay with him
every minute of the day.

882
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,715
24-hour call, do you understand?
Yes, sir.

883
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,911
He may want to go out at night.

884
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,669
Do you know anything which
might interest General Tanz?

885
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,269
Nightclubs or girls,
that sort of thing.

886
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,629
A few, sir.

887
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,354
But I don't really know
what the general's taste is, sir.

888
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,677
Let us hope that whatever it is,
it is not you, corporal.

889
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,953
However, if it should be, remember
that you're serving the fatherland.

890
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,752
I'll try to remember, sir.

891
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,918
Should he ask you to take him to his
headquarters, you are to telephone me.

892
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,350
Either here or at my hotel.
Yes, sir.

893
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,472
You'll report to Colonel Sandauer
for specific instructions.

894
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,119
Sir?

895
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,038
What is it, corporal?

896
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,355
I'm sorry, but I was supposed to have
a 24-hour leave starting tomorrow.

897
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,596
That's impossible.

898
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,150
Could I have one hour free
in the morning, sir?

899
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,873
No.

900
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,713
Sir.

901
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,638
Hartmann?
Sir?

902
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,879
This is important.

903
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,793
All right.
Now, where were we?

904
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,468
Oh, yes. Childhood diseases?

905
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,677
Measles.

906
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,996
I can't remember.
Nothing serious, I think.

907
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,553
Chickenpox.

908
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,352
Bed-wetting?

909
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,511
No, sir.
Fear of the dark?

910
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,119
No, not particularly.

911
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,231
Venereal disease?

912
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,875
No, sir.
Good.

913
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,878
Now, what about books?
Books?

914
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,469
Do you read books?
Yes, sir, I read books.

915
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,434
What?
<i>War and Peace. </i>

916
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,596
Nietzsche,
<i>The Decline of the West</i>.

917
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,997
Books on psychology,
pathology?

918
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,192
No, not much.

919
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,356
Show me your hands.

920
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,476
All right. Now, you'll have a room
assigned to you in the general's hotel.

921
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,194
He'll want to see
the principal sights of Paris.

922
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,790
You will prepare an itinerary
and submit it to me.

923
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,118
When not in the field,
the general goes to bed at 11:45.

924
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,595
He seldom drinks or smokes,

925
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,553
so you will probably have
an early evening.

926
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,991
Now, this is my private number,

927
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,872
in case you should need me.

928
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,593
Need you, sir?

929
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,588
If anything out of the ordinary
should happen, ring me immediately.

930
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,109
Is that understood?
Yes, sir.

931
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,958
Good luck.

932
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,312
Thank you, sir.

933
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:12,635
Incidentally, avoid all cemeteries,
tombs, any mention of death.

934
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,394
Yes, sir.

935
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,034
Sir?

936
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,879
Inspector Morand, please.
Third floor, room 158.

937
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:31,675
Who shall I say is here?
Thank you. I can find my own way.

938
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:39,238
[SPEAKS FRENCH]

939
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,633
Welcome, Colonel Grau,
to the spider's web.

940
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,114
How did you know it was me?

941
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,675
What other German colonel
would enter unannounced?

942
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,235
Almost any SS colonel would.

943
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,590
Actually, I saw you reflected
in the window.

944
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,712
Impossible, it's too dirty.

945
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,196
I hope you're not allergic to dust.
Old crimes, colonel.

946
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,597
They generate
a good deal of dust.

947
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,915
Unsolved crimes.

948
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,671
The dust has settled.

949
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,189
We can always unsettle it.

950
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,152
Is that why you came?
Do sit down, colonel.

951
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,079
I must apologize for the heat,
but it's nearly August,

952
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,157
when most Parisians
leave Paris.

953
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,999
Let's hope Germans have
the good sense to do the same.

954
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,873
Saint-Lô fell to the Allies
this morning.

955
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,116
BBC?

956
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,595
Coffee?
No, thank you.

957
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,276
You have dossiers
on everyone, don't you?

958
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,597
On everyone interesting.
German as well as French?

959
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,792
At the specific request
of German Intelligence,

960
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,232
we keep an occasional eye
on interesting Germans.

961
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,873
Like me?

962
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:55,198
I have always found you interesting.
Thank you.

963
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,311
What about German generals?

964
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,879
Well, what about them?

965
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,548
Generals are interesting?

966
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,548
Then, to the degree that they are
interesting, we keep an eye on them too.

967
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,038
Good. Here are the names of three generals.
I want to know everything about them.

968
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,231
Everything may be too much.

969
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,476
What specifically
are you looking for?

970
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:20,150
One of them is a murderer.

971
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,952
Only one?

972
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,038
But murder is the occupation
of generals.

973
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:30,792
Let's say what is admirable on the
large scale is monstrous on the small.

974
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,032
Since we must give medals
to mass murderers,

975
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,994
let us try to give justice
to the small entrepreneur.

976
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:43,512
Nicely put. I shall be glad
to help you if I can.

977
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,759
I realize that nothing is free in
this world, even between colleagues.

978
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,678
Especially between colleagues.

979
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,632
In exchange
for your information,

980
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:56,356
I shall arrange for the release from
prison of three French resistance.

981
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,198
Thank you.

982
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,109
Have you a favorite suspect?
Not really, no.

983
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,833
You see, on the night
of the murder,

984
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,793
each general
had something to conceal.

985
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,468
The night of the murder was...?

986
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,990
December the 12th,
1942, Warsaw.

987
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:17,193
And just as I started my investigation,
I was transferred to Paris.

988
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,630
By the murderer?
Possibly.

989
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,354
For two years, I've wanted
to reopen the case.

990
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,836
Now I can. As of today,
all three are in Paris.

991
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,758
General Gabler.

992
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,235
He's partial to the sort
of girl who was killed.

993
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,876
Oh, a girl. A crime
of passion, as we say.

994
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,755
Passion, yes, but only in the sense
of your distinguished Marquis de Sade.

995
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:43,478
Oh, a sex crime, I see.
Is that why this case excites you?

996
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,109
The girl was also
a German agent.

997
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,153
She may have been killed
because of something she knew.

998
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:52,033
That's why Kahlenberge
intrigues me the most.

999
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,913
He seems to have no private life

1000
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,350
and yet he disappears
from time to time.

1001
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,915
No one knows where or why.

1002
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,758
And General Tanz?

1003
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,234
A perfect maniac.

1004
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,514
<i>I saw him destroy</i> <i>an entire quarter of
Warsaw</i> <i>for the sheer pleasure of it. </i>

1005
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:12,076
<i>On the Eastern front,</i>
<i>he was known as The Butcher. </i>

1006
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,794
<i>He lost most of his division</i>
<i>in Russia. </i>

1007
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,117
<i>He revels in death. </i>
<i>Which is why, in a curious way,</i>

1008
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,993
<i>I don't think he's the man</i>
<i>I'm looking for. </i>

1009
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,749
<i>Anyone who has the power to destroy</i>
<i>a city whenever he chooses</i>

1010
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,191
<i>does not need such minor sport</i>
<i>as killing a girl. </i>

1011
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,799
<i>I could be wrong, of course. </i>

1012
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,078
Hartmann?
Yes.

1013
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,238
I'm Sergeant Kopatski,
the general's orderly.

1014
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,873
For the time being, that is.

1015
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,789
I forgot to take his laces out before
cleaning his shoes this morning.

1016
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,638
For God's sake,
where are your gloves?

1017
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,400
You'll get finger marks on it.
I haven't got gloves.

1018
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,716
They never told me.
Take mine.

1019
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,400
These are the general's
holiday rations.

1020
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:59,718
One bottle of cognac, one Thermos
of coffee at 40 degrees centigrade,

1021
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,273
two hundred cigarettes.

1022
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,391
Does the general drink?

1023
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,955
Like a sponge,
only he never shows it.

1024
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,832
Put the briefcase
on the back seat.

1025
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,632
On the right side.

1026
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,354
Whenever he leaves the car,
clean out the ashtrays.

1027
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,073
He smokes like a chimney.

1028
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,032
Clean everything in sight.

1029
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,276
Clean everything out of sight,

1030
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,799
including the engine.

1031
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,878
If you don't, he'll tear
your head off.

1032
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,355
It's now one second to 9:00.

1033
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,516
Here he comes.

1034
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,634
I've given him full
instructions, sir.

1035
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,274
Name?
Hartmann, Kurt, lance corporal, sir.

1036
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,755
Show the general your hands.

1037
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:49,672
Well, don't stand there like a fool.
Put your gloves on.

1038
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:50,835
He seems to know Paris.

1039
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,315
He's prepared an itinerary of the
sights of the city. I have endorsed it.

1040
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,078
I shall see you tomorrow morning
at headquarters.

1041
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,235
Yes, general.

1042
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,953
Sergeant Kopatski
is relieved as my orderly.

1043
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,879
This morning he smeared
polish on my shoelaces.

1044
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,833
Fourteen days confined to barracks.
Yes, general.

1045
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,831
We've just passed
the Place Vendôme, sir.

1046
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:33,636
The column is 142 feet high
and was erected in 1810.

1047
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:37,879
It's made of bronze from 1200 cannon
captured at Austerlitz.

1048
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,638
There's a statue of Napoleon
on the top.

1049
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:46,632
In front of us, sir,
the Tuileries Gardens.

1050
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:50,913
The Tuileries Palace used to be
in the middle of the gardens.

1051
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,633
In 1792, at the time
of the French Revolution,

1052
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,716
the Paris mob attacked
the palace,

1053
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,912
forcing the king and queen
to escape.

1054
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,394
It was burnt down in...

1055
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,318
in 1871.

1056
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,595
We are now coming
into Place de la Concorde.

1057
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,156
One of the most beautiful squares
in Paris.

1058
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,516
It was here, in the middle
of the square

1059
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,030
that Louis XVI
and Marie Antoinette

1060
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,794
were beheaded
during the revolution.

1061
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:14,919
The guillotine was there, in the
centre, where the obelisk is now.

1062
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,037
Keep your eye
on the road, corporal.

1063
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,878
Yes, sir.

1064
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,910
[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]

1065
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,479
Fräulein Gabler?
Yes.

1066
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,592
I'm Sergeant Kopke
from your father's headquarters.

1067
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,077
How did they know
which train I was on?

1068
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,599
They didn't.

1069
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,518
May I?

1070
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,679
You see, I'm Hartmann's cousin.

1071
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,872
We got no secrets, Hartmann and me.
More like brothers, really.

1072
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,311
He's all right, isn't he?
All right? Never better.

1073
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:53,149
No, it's just at the last moment he
was assigned to drive General Tanz.

1074
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:56,511
Only for today. That's
why he couldn't meet you.

1075
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,551
Well, how are things
in the fatherland?

1076
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,830
Any cities left
after all the bombing?

1077
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,474
A few, yes, here and there.

1078
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,956
There's one good thing about Paris.
It's an open city, no bombs.

1079
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,230
I hate bombs.

1080
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,069
This way, Fräulein Gabler.
I have a car for you just outside.

1081
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,077
I'll take you
to your father's hotel.

1082
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,998
Hartmann's staying there too.

1083
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,033
With General Tanz,
just for tonight.

1084
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,675
So I suppose you'll run
into him sooner or later,

1085
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,757
in the lobby or something.

1086
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,155
The gallery is shut
to the public, sir.

1087
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:36,955
But special permission has been
granted for you to see the paintings.

1088
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,196
Most of them have been
confiscated and assembled here

1089
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,595
before being sent to Germany.

1090
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,192
General Tanz.
You've been notified.

1091
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,597
Yes, corporal.
Here's all the information.

1092
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,636
On your right, sir,
paintings by Boucher,

1093
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,149
the 18th-century
French master.

1094
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,396
All these paintings
have been selected

1095
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,273
for <i>Reichsmarschall</i> Goering.

1096
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,118
What's in there?

1097
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:26,150
Paintings requisitioned from private
collections by the <i>reichsmarshcall. </i>

1098
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,634
What kind of paintings?

1099
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,877
Modern, sir,
and some impressionists.

1100
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,399
Decadent?

1101
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,636
I suppose so, sir.

1102
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,198
HARTMANN:
Light.

1103
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,073

01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:26,469
painted while in an insane asylum
during the last years of his life.

1113
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:32,559
Here, sir, a painting by Cézanne.

1114
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:03,193
How dare you touch me?

1115
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,630
Excuse me, sir, but...

1116
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,559
Never do that again!
