1
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,794
It was beautiful

2
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,285
The bridges

3
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:38,389
The river

4
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,294
There were fish

5
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,363
Now there's nothing

6
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:56,548
It was so beautiful

7
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:51,727
During the war it was so scary

8
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:56,341
Our house trembled and shook

9
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:02,244
The war was overhead

10
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,154
I was afraid in the night

11
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,531
We found some people saying
"Baghdad has fallen!"

12
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:21,625
"The Americans have taken it"

13
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,630
The Americans pass by

14
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,643
The tanks pass by

15
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,772
The helicopters pass overhead

16
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,832
The world is so scary

17
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,447
The world is so scary now

18
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,978
It's all for the oil
no more, no less

19
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,949
Why don't they take the oil
and leave us alone?

20
00:04:42,984 --> 00:04:44,916
We don't care about the oil

21
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:50,548
We've never benefitted from it

22
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,661
Saddam took everything
for thirty-five years

23
00:04:54,696 --> 00:04:57,897
and now the Americans
will be even worse

24
00:04:57,932 --> 00:05:00,932
I read in the
newspaper today

25
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,561
that the Ame ricans
deny taking Iraqi oil

26
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:07,774
Why are they guarding
Basra and Kirkuk?

27
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,642
Because they have
the oil resources

28
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,813
This humanitarian aid
they talk of, where is it?

29
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:16,082
Did you get any?
Did you get some?

30
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:18,049
Or you?

31
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,653
Why didn't they burn
the Oil Ministry?

32
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:22,420
They settled in

33
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,325
The situation is getting
worse every day

34
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,558
Every day it gets darker

35
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:30,357
Today is better than tomorrow

36
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,299
There is no security

37
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:39,033
No security, no police
And you see the streets now

38
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,742
Bush wants us to
receive him with flowers

39
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:44,575
How can he expect that?

40
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,046
If it's like this in the beginning,
what will it be in the end?

41
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:03,486
When you first come, you see
Abdul Khader Gaelani Mosque

42
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:08,933
Go right,
there's nothing on either side

43
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:14,841
No, you go straight
The streets are here and here

44
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:19,663
Go into the street,
take a right, like that

45
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:24,450
- you see a cafe -
we live opposite the cafe

46
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:29,821
You'll find me there

47
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:36,728
knock on the door, ask for
Mohammed, and I'll come out

48
00:06:55,882 --> 00:07:00,478
My boss told me
"I am like your father"

49
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,759
He raised me up from a chiId

50
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:09,159
he and my grandmother

51
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,418
He loves me, loves me

52
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:42,493
He's nice to me

53
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:45,520
He doesn't swear at me
or beat me

54
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,552
You don't clean the shop
You're always playing marbles

55
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:09,822
Are we working here,
or playing marbles?

56
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:12,655
Why are you doing this?

57
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,093
You pimp!

58
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:19,063
I told you many times
not to play marbles

59
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,969
I tell you to sort the tools -
the socket wrench is missing

60
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:26,632
where are the things?

61
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,674
Open your mind, open it!

62
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,509
Open your mind, you scum!

63
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,112
Look at me! Look at me!

64
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:38,284
Yo u tell me you cleaned
the shop this morning?

65
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:41,583
You're lying to me? Eh?

66
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,290
I'm talking to you!

67
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:46,591
Look at me!

68
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,060
Aren't I talking to you
Get up!

69
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,153
Look at me!

70
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:00,030
He loves me

71
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,822
He loves me, he's nice to me

72
00:09:04,857 --> 00:09:07,771
He loves me like his son

73
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,809
He considers me as
one of his sons

74
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,948
He doesn't hate me

75
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,713
And he won't fire me

76
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:24,762
One must form a new
outlook on the worId

77
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:29,185
I n these times we must for get
divisions and denominations!

78
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,573
This will not serve us or Islam
This will not serve Muslims

79
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:37,623
Enough of this
"He said this and they said that"

80
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:41,638
History must move us fo rward,
Not hold us back!

81
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:47,219
If History becomes a barrier,
we will suffer

82
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,668
We must use it as a lesson

83
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:54,082
and reap the benefits

84
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,933
Our history has been written
for tho usands of years

85
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:03,603
He who tells history
must tell it for all,

86
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:06,265
not only for himself

87
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,120
I never liked this thing
from the start

88
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,316
Nobody got hurt except
for us, the poor

89
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,253
Only the working class got hurt

90
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,765
If there will be work
and reconstruction,

91
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,166
we won't be the
ones who benefit

92
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,367
Only the rich will benefit

93
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:37,881
The others will stay the same:

94
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,361
The workers will stay workers

95
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,770
Everyone has their own opinion

96
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:46,175
Look at the differences
between the Sunni and Shia:

97
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,076
You can see the divisions now

98
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,420
If youre applying for a job
they'll tell you:

99
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:57,123
"Go to the Dawa Party,"

100
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:59,791
"and get their blessings"

101
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,187
Where has the Dawa Party
been for the last 35 years?

102
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,629
Where have they been?

103
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,864
Why didn't they
rid us of Saddam back then?

104
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,062
They've come back and now
it's on a silver platter for them?

105
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,338
If you're a Shia
they'll give you their blessings

106
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:14,169
If you're Sunni they won't

107
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,974
I tell you, I wish that
Saddam were still around

108
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:21,844
I wish he were still here to see
everything that's happening

109
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,251
So what if he oppressed us
and was hard on us

110
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,154
He wouId never leave
us in this situation

111
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:30,384
He wouId never allow it!

112
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,520
He told me he'd pay me later

113
00:12:05,555 --> 00:12:08,318
He's lying, he's a beggar

114
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,656
I used to dream about work:

115
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:40,324
What is work?
How do people work?

116
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,461
How's it done?
I knew nothing back then

117
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,832
I used to dream about it
I worked and dreamed

118
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:52,202
Now I kept working
and stopped dreaming

119
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:58,375
I started working to support
my mother and grand mother

120
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,380
I dropped out
and went to work

121
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:07,909
I'll keep on working
until I'm grown

122
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:28,384
My boss said,
"You must go back to school"

123
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:32,366
"School will teach you
to read and write"

124
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,148
He said, "I'll force you to go"

125
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,277
If you don't go back,
I'll beat you

126
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,389
This year is not like the others

127
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,540
First, there will be no cheating!

128
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:08,314
Don't try to bribe the teachers
or the headmaster to pass

129
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:10,908
There will be none of that!

130
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:16,086
Now they've got us in rows

131
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,885
And they're speaking
about school

132
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,260
I want you to be the vanguard

133
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:23,027
We want you to do us proud,

134
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,963
to be the pride of the New Iraq!

135
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,159
Because we have finished
with oppression and tyranny

136
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:33,205
Under Saddam they made us
sing a lot, and we became ti red

137
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,172
a new president will come

138
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:39,166
We must sing a different song,
if another president comes

139
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,536
We must sing differently

140
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,448
When you succeed
you take a step fo rward

141
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:50,956
This step will help push out
the Imperialism controling Iraq

142
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,390
With your efforts and progress

143
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,986
through your studies
and cooperation

144
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,113
The first time around
I failed the fi rst grade

145
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,579
And then I failed again
the next year

146
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:33,964
I'm four year solder than them

147
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:38,299
But I don't care, the important
thing is to read and write

148
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,912
Who is God?

149
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,507
Where is God?

150
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,524
Yes, in the sky!

151
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,645
How must we say our prayer,

152
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,697
that we must know by heart?

153
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,601
The chapter,
the Opening Chapter

154
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:13,264
Say it: The Opening Chapter

155
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,272
This is something every Muslim

156
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,043
must know by heart

157
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,181
And you can know it, too

158
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:23,409
if God is willing

159
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,618
In the name of God, The
Merciful, The Compassionate

160
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,285
All praise be to God,
Lord of the Worlds

161
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,187
The Merciful, Compassionate
Master of the Day of Judgment

162
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:36,128
You alone do we worship,
You alone do we turn to

163
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,594
Guide us to the Right eous Way

164
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,479
The way o f those on whom
you have endowed Your Grace

165
00:16:40,514 --> 00:16:43,330
not the way of those who earn
Your wrath, or goastray

166
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,279
I have an idea about
those who pray:

167
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,513
The Drunks and the Sinners

168
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,752
If you treat them well, they
return more than they receive

169
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:03,968
But one who prays and calls
himself a God-fearing man

170
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:08,150
In matters of work or money
he will always screw you

171
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,498
What did they tell you
in school today?

172
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:13,981
They didn't give me anything

173
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:15,429
Did they give you homework?

174
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,335
I did it all in school
I don't do it at home

175
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:24,643
How is the Reading book now?
Is it still the simple stuff?

176
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:28,380
Yes, it's still the same
They're bringing new books

177
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:30,647
The books we have are torn

178
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,518
Do you know how to
write your name now?

179
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:33,384
Slow down, Boss!

180
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:37,106
Can you write your name,
"Mohammed"?

181
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:40,793
Like this,
like this, and like this

182
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:43,246
Good! You can writ e
"Mohammed"

183
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:45,629
And your father's name?
"Haithem"

184
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:50,069
That's the only thing
I still don't know

185
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:51,802
I can write it, it's easy

186
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:56,475
"Haithem" HAl-THEM
You haven't written it before?

187
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,242
You brother of a whore!

188
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,746
Four years! And you still can't
write your father's name?

189
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:04,079
When will you learn
your father's name?

190
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:08,779
What is it with you?
It's the fifth year

191
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,734
I never expect to see
my father again

192
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:26,136
My father is dead to me

193
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:29,607
I will never see my father,
or anything

194
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,645
My father was a lieutenant

195
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,414
He was a policeman

196
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,586
Then he started
talking about Saddam

197
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,680
They put him in prison

198
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:27,231
They showed him on TV

199
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:30,669
I saw what they
were doing in his mouth

200
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:33,297
They were sear ching his mouth

201
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,642
They were sear ching
his teeth and beard

202
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:38,633
and his hair

203
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,916
And they showed
how he was before

204
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:49,821
How he was holding a sword

205
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,619
In the past

206
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:19,316
That shooting we
heard this morning?

207
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:23,288
When we were sitting here
Do you know what it was?

208
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:27,816
A brother and sister!

209
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:33,232
The Americans called to them:
"Stop, where are you going?"

210
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:34,967
They were afraid
and started running

211
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:38,802
They killed them both

212
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:42,739
They were just buried
The shots were for the funeral

213
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,306
A brother and sister!

214
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,609
The other day they passed by
with cars, not tanks

215
00:21:01,644 --> 00:21:04,829
They were driving
very slowly in their car

216
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,365
They were chewing gum

217
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,768
They drove forward
One of them was in back

218
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:15,741
He was watching the kids
in case they pulled a pistol

219
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:18,266
That's how he watched them

220
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,986
They may stay for a long time
How would I know?

221
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,420
It's for the oil

222
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,616
It's for the oil, isn't it?

223
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,861
They're going to
install a new president

224
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,754
It's not safe here

225
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:07,350
It's scary
there's no security

226
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,594
I want to go abroad

227
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,732
When you are abroad,
nothing will happen to you

228
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:15,996
But here you can't go out
It's not safe

229
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:21,072
My teacher told me
I could be a pilot

230
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:25,610
What would you like to be?
An Engineer, a Pilot?

231
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:28,977
'A Doctor?' I told her 'A Pilot'

232
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,051
I want to fly the plane,

233
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,689
to see a place
that's beautiful and nice

234
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:41,989
Not Iraq, but a beautiful place

235
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,691
I imagine... I imagine...

236
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:54,698
I'm high in the sky
I can see the doves, the sky

237
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,804
I can see the birds

238
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:07,018
I am in the plane
and seeing countries

239
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,919
Beautiful and nice

240
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,991
I fly down to those countries

241
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:16,161
I'll go to that country

242
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:19,426
The beautiful one

243
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,057
D-A-R spells what?
"dar"

244
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:04,935
D-U-R spells what?
"dur"

245
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,743
What does it spell?
"dur"

246
00:24:08,778 --> 00:24:12,517
What's the meaning of "dur?"

247
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:16,078
Many houses!

248
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,958
"dur" - What do we say?
"Dur"

249
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:27,124
How do we we write "Dur?"
D-U-R

250
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:32,938
And one house?
We write D-A-R

251
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,457
DAR

252
00:24:34,492 --> 00:24:35,733
DUR

253
00:24:35,768 --> 00:24:36,866
DAR

254
00:24:36,901 --> 00:24:37,964
DUR

255
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:44,115
When we say "dar" it means:
"one house"

256
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:48,019
One house
Who lives in one house?

257
00:24:48,054 --> 00:24:50,587
People

258
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,989
You, Mohammed,
Who lives in your house?

259
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,845
My uncles, me, my mother
and my grand mother

260
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,531
All of you live in what?
A "dar" - one house

261
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:08,006
Where do you live?
In a house

262
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:12,244
And the house next door?

263
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:15,712
Our neighbors

264
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:18,700
Mohammed's house,
plus his neighbors' ...

265
00:25:18,735 --> 00:25:21,653
How many does that make?
Daran! Two houses!

266
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:25,020
How many?

267
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,834
No, I'm telling you, is it clear?

268
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,705
Don't come to work
starting Tuesday morning

269
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,810
What's the point in letting
you work here an hour a day?

270
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:49,331
I'll find another kid
to take your place

271
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:52,817
I'll find some little kid
and let him work

272
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:55,919
Ah?
What do you say?

273
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,557
Which is better?
School or work?

274
00:25:58,592 --> 00:25:59,523
Work

275
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,893
Why?
Doesn't the school teach you?

276
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:03,807
No, it doesn't teach me

277
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:05,686
It doesn't teach you?

278
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,966
What will you learn today?

279
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,991
To work

280
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:14,719
You're going to
learn to work today?

281
00:26:14,754 --> 00:26:17,235
Do you know how
to write your name?

282
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,870
Write your name here

283
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,049
Okay
And your father's?

284
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,687
Is there any one who can't
write their father's name?

285
00:26:28,722 --> 00:26:31,815
I only know my first name

286
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:37,128
How many months has
your father's name taken?

287
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:39,029
Show me how to write it here

288
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:44,001
The first letter in the name,
what do you call it?

289
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:48,805
Eh? You don't know it?

290
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,207
So why are you in school?

291
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:57,949
Why are you going to school
and don't know the letter 'M'?

292
00:26:57,984 --> 00:27:01,316
Are you pleased with yourself?

293
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:07,783
Stand up and go away

294
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,699
Haven't you been in
school for two months?

295
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:20,872
You spent five years just to
write your name, "Mohammed"

296
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:23,408
When will you learn "Haithem?"

297
00:27:23,443 --> 00:27:24,975
Next year?

298
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,163
He's been in school four years
and he only knows his name!

299
00:27:28,198 --> 00:27:31,316
Aren't I talking to you?
Why will you say I fired you?

300
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:34,919
Because you can't
write your father's name

301
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:37,873
Come here! I'm talking to you!

302
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:40,792
Come here!
Why are you crying?

303
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:44,160
Did I hit you?

304
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:46,220
Did I beat you? Come here!

305
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:49,866
Did I hit you?

306
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,926
Can you write
you'r father's name?

307
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,996
Why not?
I'm talking to you! Look at me!

308
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:00,877
What's this? A handkerchief?

309
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:04,279
Better to clean your
face with your sandals!

310
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,383
You dog!

311
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:09,052
Today when you go
- look here! -

312
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:12,590
Bring a pencil tomorrow
to write your father's name

313
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:16,094
If you don't know how to
write it I'll roast you alive!

314
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:19,330
Understand? You write
your father's name tomorrow

315
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:22,799
Go, you pimp! You mule!

316
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,801
What's his father's name?
"Haithem!"

317
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:28,239
He can't read or write!
After five years in school!

318
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:29,773
You dog, son of a bitch!

319
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:33,211
Five years in the first grade!
Why are you going to school?

320
00:28:33,246 --> 00:28:35,873
Why do they spend
the money for you to go?

321
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:40,185
He's goes to school, drops out,
goes to school and drops out

322
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,638
And he doesn't know anything

323
00:28:42,673 --> 00:28:45,021
It's better for him not to go

324
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:48,538
It s better not to go, I tell you!
Better not to go!

325
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:52,021
Go tell your grand mother
that you're dropping out!

326
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,792
11 years old and
you can't write?

327
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:10,914
In the morning

328
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,917
I went with my uncle

329
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,955
When he left in the morning
he said, "Come with me"

330
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,290
I went with him to the big shop

331
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:22,191
I started working with them

332
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,105
It's much better for me

333
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:39,511
At my old work, they beat me
and swore at me

334
00:29:39,546 --> 00:29:42,810
I don't like anyone to beat me

335
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:51,488
In my uncle's shop,
nobody beats me

336
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:55,084
Nobody swears at me,
and I feel relaxed

337
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:00,831
I will never go back

338
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:06,337
I have forgotten him,
even my boss name

339
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:08,305
I left him, once and for all

340
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:15,227
If anyone tells me to return,
I will say:

341
00:30:15,262 --> 00:30:19,379
"I would rather
kil I myself than go back"

342
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,890
Beware our people!

343
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:04,190
We will rise up
I ike a great earthquake!

344
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:11,201
The people were
forced into silence,

345
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:14,034
and only in death couId
they break their chains!

346
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,577
The crescent moon
of our celebration nears

347
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:25,149
The celebration for which
we have shed our tears

348
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:30,416
Be gone, Oppression
and torture of Saddam!

349
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:36,359
We are the generation of Sadr

350
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:41,366
Grant us victory
over the blasphe mers!

351
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:45,637
We are the generation of Sadr!

352
00:31:45,672 --> 00:31:50,472
Ali, grant us victory!

353
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:02,913
As one of those
children bornin the 70s

354
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:05,456
I always heard about
Saddam's oppression

355
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:07,287
of the Shia

356
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,228
Saddam knows

357
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:16,267
- as do oppressors I ike him -

358
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:17,996
and it's clear to all,

359
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:23,200
that the Shia are the most
revolutionary of all Muslims

360
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,475
I loved religion and
I was very religious

361
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,020
I entered the Hawza,

362
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,922
I became a disciple, a student
of the Hawza

363
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,958
I saw Mohammed Al Sadr
almost every day

364
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,101
He created in me
a kind of courage

365
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:55,271
And this courage
grew ever stronger

366
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,710
until I resolved to
challenge the regime myself,

367
00:32:58,745 --> 00:33:00,302
to challenge the Baathists

368
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,472
They ordered my arrest

369
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:08,375
They threw me in a cell
for an entire year

370
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,282
Nobody passed by,
nobody asked after me

371
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:32,076
There's no fight between Shia
and Sunni, especially in Iraq

372
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:35,011
The only differences were
created by Saddam

373
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,380
and Saddam's regime

374
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:40,475
He made the disagreement
between Shia and Sunna

375
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:46,024
After the Islamic
Revolution in Iran

376
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:49,192
Saddam sounded the alarm

377
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,629
that the Iraqi Shia might
make another revolution

378
00:33:51,664 --> 00:33:54,496
I ike the revolution in Iran

379
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,200
He began to punish the Shia

380
00:33:57,235 --> 00:34:00,102
for their Islamic
customs and traditions

381
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,432
He forbade flagellation

382
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:08,407
They take up black colors
and weeping as a symbol

383
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,749
And flagellation,
this is also a symbol

384
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:19,553
of great tragedy they tast ed
losing I mam Ali Bin Abi-Talib

385
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:44,385
They came to teach us
of Western Democracy

386
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,940
Killing, displacement,
and torture,

387
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:51,460
arrests without charge

388
00:36:51,495 --> 00:36:53,910
- in the land of Iraq -

389
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,948
This is the Democracy
they have brought!

390
00:36:56,983 --> 00:37:00,283
But Islam is
the true Democracy,

391
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:03,287
the opposite of the
false, empty Democracy

392
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:05,346
they are boasting of

393
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:08,324
We are not terrorists
- never! -

394
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:12,563
as enemies of God and
The Prophet try to depict us

395
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:16,767
They would suck away
our wealth,

396
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:19,258
and control our minds

397
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:23,933
After all that they accuse us
of being terrorists!

398
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:30,580
Where is the money
they are squandering?

399
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:34,779
Where are the food supplies?
They blame security problems!

400
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:38,389
But by God!
You see all these trucks,

401
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:40,823
coming from everywhere

402
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:44,361
all carrying supplies
for the Americans,

403
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:47,865
carrying supplies for
the security forces,

404
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,333
the instruments of repression!

405
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:54,303
They are not
carrying food supplies

406
00:37:54,472 --> 00:38:03,246
What a shame
that some still believe

407
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,399
the occupying power has
Iraqi interests at heart!

408
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:09,518
the occupying power has
Iraqi interests at heart!

409
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:14,288
What kind of fool
couId believe such a thing?

410
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:57,901
Either we wil I hold legal
elections to liberate Iraq,

411
00:38:57,936 --> 00:39:02,873
or we remainin the strangle-
hold of the Americans

412
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:07,910
Maybe it will bring conflict,
but we are prepared for that

413
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:27,131
Maybe the occupation forces
will oppose us in the streets

414
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:33,632
We will lead civil disobed ience
and sit down before the tanks

415
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:48,818
To prove we are in charge,
that we can take our freedom

416
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:58,496
The important thing is to
dissolve the im posed council

417
00:39:58,531 --> 00:40:00,657
and replace it
with an elected one

418
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:15,708
We won't abide those imposed
by the Occupation Forces

419
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,917
Let them not
imagine that in Iraq

420
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:27,057
though we faced 35 years
of Baath ist oppression

421
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:32,530
that we don't know the
meaning of democracy

422
00:40:32,565 --> 00:40:35,863
We know what democracy is

423
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:39,668
If elections succeed
in Naseriyah,

424
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:42,996
they'll throw out the Americans
with a slap on the face

425
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,816
It will be like this: "The Islamic
movements propose holding

426
00:40:51,851 --> 00:40:53,535
direct general elections
by secret ballot,

427
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,184
direct general elections
by secret ballot,

428
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:59,824
to elect a council to represent
all the people of our province"

429
00:40:59,859 --> 00:41:06,063
Everyone should feel they have
a voice on the committee

430
00:41:06,098 --> 00:41:08,030
- Yes, yes -

431
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:12,203
So we're saying four Islamic
and three Democracy...

432
00:41:12,238 --> 00:41:13,803
- That's seven -

433
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,807
And three... We aren't
including a Sunni position?

434
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:19,210
No, that will create factionalism

435
00:41:19,245 --> 00:41:20,643
It's factional? Okay, skip it

436
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:25,080
This is the reality,
I want to explain...

437
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:29,687
These elections won't bring
clear victory to any one group

438
00:41:29,722 --> 00:41:31,086
This is the reality

439
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:34,091
The Religious Scholars are the
last wordon the elections

440
00:41:34,126 --> 00:41:35,025
and we will follow
the Religious Scholars

441
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:42,099
Holding local elections proves
national elections are possible

442
00:41:42,134 --> 00:41:46,068
And if God is willing,
it wil I be a signal

443
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:51,835
for the occupiers and the UN
that elections will succeed

444
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,826
We will support elections

445
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:17,099
Elections that are
democratic, popular and Shia

446
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:21,195
And it's your right to vote
for whomever you like

447
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,039
We are moving on this path

448
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:29,944
and we will hold a conference
of political parties in Naseriyah

449
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:37,253
First, we must
organize our selves

450
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:44,295
If we can do that with dignity,
then our path will be true

451
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:48,165
The Advisory Council,
employed by the CPA,

452
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,267
was appointed, not elected

453
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:56,739
So we fought against it
using non-violent resistance

454
00:42:56,774 --> 00:43:01,045
We decided the solution is to
replace the council by elections

455
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,146
We are under occupation
Let's be realistic

456
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:07,051
The occupier won't allow us
to do something be fore July

457
00:43:07,086 --> 00:43:09,051
without forcing
their own conditions

458
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,639
I know from experience
there's a decision I ike that

459
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:16,193
They are shaking our hand
and stabbing us in the back

460
00:43:16,228 --> 00:43:18,561
It's a game!

461
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:22,866
After July they will allow us
a small portion of our freedom

462
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:26,029
A portion
Not the whole thing!

463
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:30,274
We must beware the factional
provocation being sown in Iraq

464
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:35,046
They had th is plan in 1917,
when the Eng lish occupied Iraq

465
00:43:35,081 --> 00:43:40,719
in the 1st World War, when
General Maude took Baghdad

466
00:43:40,754 --> 00:43:46,357
They tried it then, but the Shia
and Sunni declared unity

467
00:43:46,392 --> 00:43:48,657
and so their plan failed

468
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:51,161
So I suggest we not to raise
this sub ject in the elections,

469
00:43:51,196 --> 00:43:56,191
as all groups - Sunni, Shia,
Sabians - are true patriots

470
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:59,368
Even these parti es
are not legal parties

471
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:04,775
A party must have a program,
some issues they represent

472
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:08,645
There are no laws
governing political parties

473
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:31,699
Excuse us - let's hear what
Sheik Aws has to say

474
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:39,293
Brothers, we have no time
to argue and quarrel

475
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:44,682
As our brothers have noted,
the situation is critical,

476
00:44:44,717 --> 00:44:47,014
and our province is forgotten

477
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:51,288
This meeting between Islamic
and Democracy move ments

478
00:44:51,323 --> 00:44:55,884
may be impossible in the future

479
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:01,047
Perhaps some foreign
hand will intervene,

480
00:45:01,082 --> 00:45:05,767
or the Devil may walk
between our rows

481
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:11,237
I don't believe this opportunity
will ever be repeated

482
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:02,772
Our mission and our duty,
commanded by God,

483
00:46:02,807 --> 00:46:07,022
is to show the correct path
to those who go astray

484
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:16,306
They are bringing the sins
of alcohol to Naseriyah

485
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:22,244
and people pass by them
without protest!

486
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:31,188
Now we will consider it our
duty to ask the faithful

487
00:46:31,223 --> 00:46:41,899
if they pass the flea market
and see alcohol sellers...

488
00:46:41,934 --> 00:46:46,270
We are warning them
against staying there

489
00:46:46,305 --> 00:46:49,072
in the market, selling alcohol

490
00:46:49,107 --> 00:46:52,974
We are an Islamic city!

491
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:58,113
The Mehdi Army will lead

492
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:04,154
groups to cleanse this
area after three days

493
00:47:04,189 --> 00:47:05,856
following this warning!

494
00:47:05,891 --> 00:47:10,105
The Devil's plan is weak!

495
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,320
And God i s on our side!

496
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:54,349
Praise be to
Moqtada, our leader!

497
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:59,656
We are with you, not Bush!
Nor with any oppressor!

498
00:50:59,691 --> 00:51:03,625
The alcohol sellers will escape!

499
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,264
We weren't doing anything,
only passing by!

500
00:51:07,299 --> 00:51:09,459
Just keep quiet

501
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:14,269
By Abbas Bin Ali Bin Ali Talib!

502
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:16,489
If wewe reguilty,
we would have run!

503
00:51:16,524 --> 00:51:18,675
...and I used to com plain
about Saddam!

504
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,776
God bless your parents

505
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,195
You!
What's the matter with you?

506
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:23,522
There's nothing
wrong with me

507
00:51:23,557 --> 00:51:24,780
After a bit you'll be released

508
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:29,384
But you asked what's wrong?
- Yes, what's the matter?

509
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:33,523
It's blasphemy! Those wine
sellers in the month of Ashura,

510
00:51:33,558 --> 00:51:36,083
and you arrested us!

511
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:40,829
I won t go
Just let me talk with him

512
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:44,768
I told you: I will release him
If he's innocent I'll release him

513
00:51:44,803 --> 00:51:49,364
Sometimes a man might have
troubles, even with his family

514
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:54,711
We were saved from ty ranny!
And you brought anothe r?

515
00:51:54,746 --> 00:51:56,745
How can it be, brother?

516
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:02,853
When Saddam fell I rejoiced,
but now again I m blindfolded!

517
00:52:02,888 --> 00:52:05,222
We've returned to
Saddam's time once again!

518
00:52:05,257 --> 00:52:07,591
You arrested him
in the market?

519
00:52:07,626 --> 00:52:09,424
Yes
He was selling alcohol

520
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,690
By God,
he was selling auto scrap!

521
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:19,469
Saddam uprooted my family
How is it I'm bound up again?

522
00:52:19,504 --> 00:52:21,338
How can it be?
- Stop your noise -

523
00:52:21,373 --> 00:52:25,638
Even God cannot accept it!

524
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:31,214
You're slandering people
In this holy month of Ashura!

525
00:52:31,249 --> 00:52:37,119
What can we do? Today
we didn't even eat breakfast

526
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:44,288
And now you're
framing people

527
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:49,900
We are living through
challenging times in this city

528
00:52:49,935 --> 00:52:52,368
We will either live or die

529
00:52:55,405 --> 00:53:00,377
We will close every door of
depravity opened by Ame rica

530
00:53:00,412 --> 00:53:04,648
And we know that America
is preparing our punishment

531
00:53:04,683 --> 00:53:07,617
and will try to destroy us
by any means

532
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:14,553
They fear the Mehdi Army
will drive them from Iraq

533
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,826
We are asking in a civil way,

534
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:22,297
and if we are disappointed
 n this path

535
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:25,301
then we must chooseanother
path granted us by God

536
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:32,300
We turned out in a
peaceful demonstration

537
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:36,669
to call for the release
of Mustapha Yacoubi

538
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,507
A lot of people came

539
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:43,546
The Spanish were on this side,
and the people on the other

540
00:54:43,581 --> 00:54:46,845
The Spanish had taken
u p battle positions

541
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:52,889
The police were pushed back
and began shooting in the air

542
00:54:52,924 --> 00:54:57,610
It seems some of the
demonstrators had weapons

543
00:54:57,645 --> 00:55:02,297
A firefight started,
many people were shot

544
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:46,225
On TV we saw the Mehdi Army
training in Baghdad

545
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:51,920
Moqtada's speech made the
Americans very nervous

546
00:55:51,955 --> 00:55:57,581
They trampled our holy places,
they beat our Imams

547
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:03,722
The south will not be silent,
and no American will feel safe

548
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:07,997
Where is the Democracy?
Is this the Democracy?

549
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:09,464
Is this the Freedom?

550
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:13,595
They routed Saddam and now
100 Saddams to replaced him!

551
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:07,817
America promised a life of
comfort, freedom, democracy,

552
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:11,156
but we knew it was all lies!

553
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:31,197
The American military
claims they have stopped

554
00:57:31,232 --> 00:57:34,182
using some methods of
interrogation in Iraq

555
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:38,988
after revelations of
torture of Iraqi detainees

556
00:57:39,023 --> 00:57:41,923
in Abu Graib prison,
near Baghdad

557
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:50,198
As to how what
happened in that prison

558
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:54,567
will reflect on America
and the American people...

559
00:57:56,739 --> 00:58:00,977
...those disgraceful acts
do not reflect our character

560
00:58:01,012 --> 00:58:04,982
As we have broadcast
all over the world,

561
00:58:05,017 --> 00:58:08,952
we will conduct a
thorough investigation

562
00:58:08,987 --> 00:58:11,739
that the whole world will see

563
00:58:11,774 --> 00:58:14,934
In order to find out the truth

564
00:58:14,969 --> 00:58:18,059
of how these
things happened,

565
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:20,795
whether there were any
decisions made,

566
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,033
or orders given,
and how they were delivered

567
00:58:24,068 --> 00:58:27,237
And our investigations will be
completely different

568
00:58:27,272 --> 00:58:30,469
from what was done
under Saddam Hussein

569
00:58:30,504 --> 00:58:33,667
when no investigations
were carried out

570
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:38,026
Has America saved us
from the Baathists?

571
00:58:38,061 --> 00:58:41,776
They've changed the faces
They removed Saddam,

572
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:47,551
and here are the Baathists:
They brought Alawi his kind

573
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:53,162
Who can trust America? Who
can trust the biggest tyrant?

574
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:56,030
America is supporting
Israel on one side,

575
00:58:56,065 --> 00:59:02,872
and we Muslims trust that
America came to help us?

576
00:59:02,907 --> 00:59:05,642
Verily,
glory goes to the revolutionary

577
00:59:05,677 --> 00:59:07,842
Glory goes to the resistance

578
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:12,814
And shame, disgrace and
defeat go the occupier!

579
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:16,113
When will we begin the fight?

580
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:22,190
You saw what
became of the spies

581
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:28,164
who in formed on holy warriors
in Sadr City, in Baghdad:

582
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:33,770
They were hanged
from the electricity poles!

583
00:59:33,805 --> 00:59:36,534
So shall it be with all spies

584
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:40,808
Peace be upon Mohammed
and his followers!

585
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:47,350
Curse his enemies and
make victorio us his son,

586
00:59:47,385 --> 00:59:50,842
Moqtada! Moqtada! Moqtada!

587
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:19,347
If Vietnam was able
to defeat America,

588
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:26,222
then we of courage and faith
can de feat the enemy,

589
01:00:26,257 --> 01:00:33,128
and expel them, God willing
We can do it

590
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:56,386
If America leaves, these people
will be like a return of Saddam

591
01:00:56,421 --> 01:01:00,914
Saddam in a new form,
a new image

592
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:07,296
The city is empty,
a ghost town,

593
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:11,790
and Moqtada's men control it

594
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:59,499
America promised one
thing and did another

595
01:01:59,534 --> 01:02:03,151
They came as I iberators
and became occupiers

596
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:06,989
They came to help the people
but then turned against us

597
01:02:07,024 --> 01:02:10,860
Against the Iraqi people,
against Iraq

598
01:02:10,895 --> 01:02:11,959
That's America

599
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:16,866
Their problem is they only
know how to use force

600
01:02:16,901 --> 01:02:22,702
You have to study the
Iraqis to know them

601
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:27,809
They shouId learn our
customs, our habits...

602
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:30,413
It's impossible to change us
with the barrel of a tank

603
01:02:30,448 --> 01:02:32,080
It's impossible

604
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:36,784
If they bring tanks here then
they are against the people

605
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:44,160
We are in the center of the city
It has become a battleground

606
01:02:44,195 --> 01:02:47,129
there are people living
here, going to cafes...

607
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,860
...and that's how it is

608
01:03:55,932 --> 01:03:57,431
America wants the bombings!

609
01:03:57,466 --> 01:04:00,169
They are killing
civilians in the street

610
01:04:00,204 --> 01:04:01,869
it's deadly serious

611
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:03,973
They say: "We came to save
you from Saddam Hussein"

612
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:06,042
Who put Saddam in power
if not them?

613
01:04:06,077 --> 01:04:08,042
They supported Saddam
for 35 years

614
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:10,479
They want to build
a military base here

615
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:12,582
to steal our wealth and our oil

616
01:04:12,617 --> 01:04:16,484
They want to take everything!

617
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,476
There is only one God!

618
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:45,480
America is the enemy of God!

619
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:17,545
Lighten their load, oh God

620
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:22,919
and bring their spirits
to you, oh God

621
01:05:22,954 --> 01:05:26,954
You are all-forgiving, oh God

622
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:31,043
You are the Mercy and
the Blessing, oh God

623
01:05:31,078 --> 01:05:35,062
Look favorably upon
their virtues, oh God

624
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:39,302
If they have done wrong,
for give their trespasses

625
01:05:39,337 --> 01:05:42,336
All of you have come for
the sake of your dead

626
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:45,335
All the dead of the King
of Believers, the Shia

627
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:56,104
I remember all the days

628
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:01,407
they play before my eyes

629
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:08,649
In autumn they
work the brick ovens

630
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:11,157
sometimes I go to watch

631
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:19,697
sometimes I go to the
ovens and watch the fire

632
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:27,671
In the summer it's very hot

633
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:30,578
Without shade you won't last

634
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:33,081
You have to sit in the shadows

635
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:41,152
I will bury you

636
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:44,022
You'll bury yourself

637
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:47,063
When you take back moves
I lose my desire to play

638
01:07:47,098 --> 01:07:48,121
That's what you always say

639
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:50,297
You know me too well

640
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:53,130
Youre taking back your moves!

641
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:55,668
You only say that
when you lose

642
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,767
You have won very beautifully

643
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,768
But victory doesn't come easily

644
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:02,769
That's all

645
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:11,414
When I was born,

646
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:16,826
my father named me
Mahmoud, after an Imam

647
01:08:16,861 --> 01:08:18,392
My father

648
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,362
He said,
"I will let this one study"

649
01:08:20,397 --> 01:08:21,693
And he put me in school

650
01:08:22,331 --> 01:08:24,231
before he died

651
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:28,198
When my father went to God,

652
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:32,139
- we had sheep, we lived
in the countryside -

653
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:35,177
They said "Mind the sheep
You don't know how to study"

654
01:08:35,212 --> 01:08:37,338
"You won't amount to anything"

655
01:08:38,714 --> 01:08:41,706
I don't want my
children to be like me

656
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:44,818
Let them be different

657
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:00,599
Sulei!

658
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:05,731
Come, little white sheep

659
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:10,303
Sulei,
I got my hair cut at a barber

660
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:12,748
What style did you ask for?

661
01:09:12,783 --> 01:09:14,113
The Arnold

662
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:19,288
Suleiman is a friend of mine

663
01:09:19,323 --> 01:09:20,721
Sulei! Not like that!

664
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:23,384
You have destroyed my head!

665
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:26,629
As we get older,
we won't for get each other

666
01:09:26,664 --> 01:09:28,462
We won't say

667
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:32,763
"Now we're older
No need to visit each other"

668
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:39,599
As we grow older, our
friendship must grow stronger

669
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:46,679
I will be a teacher: Suleiman
says he wants to be a doctor

670
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,517
He jokes with me:

671
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:53,322
"If you become sick, I'll
give you the wrong injection!"

672
01:09:53,357 --> 01:09:55,586
"Not the one
that makes you better"

673
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:57,152
Go for five minutes!

674
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,694
And if I last that long?
- I'll give you whatever you like

675
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:05,462
We have loved each
other since child hood

676
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:08,899
Like brothers

677
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,808
When we first moved here

678
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:17,175
Bizhar and I
became best friends

679
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:21,806
And it's the same at school

680
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:24,687
Me and Bizhar,
we always stuck together

681
01:10:24,722 --> 01:10:27,383
We still walk to school togethe r

682
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:35,562
If anyone fights with us,
we defend each othe r

683
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:14,702
Teacher! Teacher! Teacher!

684
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:19,708
Stand up Suleiman, please,
and stand up, Salar

685
01:11:19,743 --> 01:11:24,680
I'm asking, Salar, "Who's that?"
- "That is Suleiman"

686
01:11:24,715 --> 01:11:27,547
Clap for him

687
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:38,592
However much you
study, it's not enough

688
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:40,826
However much you
study, it's too little

689
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:48,030
There are those who only
study, and they'll be doctors

690
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:49,870
And those who haven't studied

691
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:54,535
They must take any
job they can find

692
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:02,915
I pray my grades are
good enough just to pass

693
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:18,500
The principal and I
are on uneven terms

694
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:26,108
He's always saying "You'll fail
But who knows?

695
01:12:26,143 --> 01:12:28,474
He just says that
so you'll study more

696
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:29,942
Bring them back, Rosho!

697
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:13,489
Always with the sheep,
summer and winter

698
01:13:13,524 --> 01:13:14,581
Why?

699
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:18,559
I don't want to leave school

700
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:23,463
I want to go to college
and be something

701
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:46,082
We pray to God to end
violence and suffering

702
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:49,716
to give the Kurdish people rest

703
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:57,900
I tried hard to put Suleiman
in religious school

704
01:13:57,935 --> 01:14:00,164
to become an Imam

705
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:04,003
I will die soon

706
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:11,046
In my remaining days I
will attend the mosque

707
01:14:11,081 --> 01:14:14,015
and spend my time
praying to God

708
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:26,328
I said to myself,
"I have six sons"

709
01:14:26,363 --> 01:14:29,963
"Let one of them be for God,"

710
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:32,057
"and let the others
be for this life"

711
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:10,470
It is written in the Quran,
"If we stay alive, we will see"

712
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:20,674
"Any place touched by sunlight
will be governed by Islam"

713
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:38,759
Now they say the
Kurds are blasphemers,

714
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,897
that Kurds brought
Amecica to Iraq

715
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:44,832
They say,
"We will behead all the Kurds"

716
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:47,506
People think the
Kurds are blasphemers

717
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:50,143
But suicide bombers?
Can you imagine?

718
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:53,204
They think it s Jihad,
that you'll be a martyr

719
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:59,820
But if there is religion left
it is among the Kurds

720
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:26,004
In the past, we moved from
our village because of poverty

721
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:30,651
Saddam Hussein
destroyed the villages

722
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:33,121
He turned the area
into a wasteland

723
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:35,055
He changed it
into an Arab area

724
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:45,000
Because bones were broken
and blood spilled between us

725
01:16:45,035 --> 01:16:50,870
Ourunity and brotherhood
will never return

726
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:01,582
God brought America
to the Kurds

727
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:04,353
He brought her tous,
and they liberated Iraq

728
01:17:04,388 --> 01:17:06,787
They toppled the regime

729
01:17:07,956 --> 01:17:10,925
We came out of the
darkness into the light

730
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:20,235
There's been enough
war in Iraq

731
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:22,235
How long can it continue?

732
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:25,967
Let's lay our weap ons down
and practice politics

733
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:30,946
If you compare Jewish people
with the Kurds:

734
01:17:30,981 --> 01:17:34,814
They are much fewer

735
01:17:35,117 --> 01:17:37,312
They have their own flag,
their own government

736
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:40,078
They are free and independent

737
01:17:40,756 --> 01:17:42,124
Why can't the Kurds
be independent?

738
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:43,751
Why can't they have their flag?

739
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:53,326
Even if I don't live to see it,
my children will benefit

740
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:58,106
The Prophet said,
I desire nothing

741
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:04,111
He said, "Life is nothing,
it is empty, like a house"

742
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:07,172
"with two doors: You ent er on
one side and exit on the other"

743
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:11,979
I want no thing from this life

744
01:18:18,894 --> 01:18:21,886
All my children,
from youngest to oldest,

745
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:26,925
have followed in my footsteps

746
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:33,398
They are walking in my path

747
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:58,763
We ask God in His glory
to hear our prayer

748
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:01,203
on this Friday sabbath

749
01:19:01,238 --> 01:19:03,330
Dear brothers

750
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:06,973
We have all been
requested to go

751
01:19:07,008 --> 01:19:16,218
to cast our vote for our future,
our country, our nation

752
01:19:16,253 --> 01:19:18,083
To draw it with our hands!

753
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:24,075
You must sacrifice one day
to save a persecuted people

754
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:28,396
Tounco ver how an entire
nation was buried alive

755
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:30,887
in the Anfal Campaign!

756
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:36,271
It's just a paper that you
put in the ballot box

757
01:19:36,306 --> 01:19:38,805
The ballot box, my brothers

758
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:42,075
Many years we fought
in the mountains

759
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:45,245
Many years we struggled
against the oppressor

760
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,943
All that was nothing compared
with the vote you will cast

761
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:52,219
The vote that you will cast

762
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:57,157
is better than 100 bombs
and 200 boxes of bullets!

763
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:06,826
If the Kurds unite they will be
something this time around

764
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:11,006
This is your only paper?

765
01:20:11,041 --> 01:20:11,538
Yes

766
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:12,439
Then go in

767
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:14,999
Let them come, brother,
let them come!

768
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,348
Check our bodies well!

769
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:27,419
Unti I now we have been
unknown to the world

770
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:29,990
Kurdistan! Kurdistan!

771
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:35,054
Now they will know
who we are

772
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:38,465
You can't stand here,
the line is ove r there

773
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:45,873
Brothers! Be patient!
I'll let all of you in!

774
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:50,373
Nobody without a
form can come in!

775
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:00,972
Brother, I checked with
all the polling stations

776
01:21:01,007 --> 01:21:03,557
Anyone with an ID,
just ask for his ration card

777
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:11,089
so we don't lose any votes for
the Iraqi National Assembly

778
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:15,937
You must mark list 130,
it's the Kurdish one

779
01:21:15,972 --> 01:21:19,600
These are for other parties

780
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:22,344
Put your right index
finger in the ink

781
01:21:22,379 --> 01:21:24,477
Yes, this one

782
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:27,106
Where shall I put this?

783
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:30,352
I'm illiterate
I have my husband with me

784
01:21:30,387 --> 01:21:33,913
Mark 130, it's the Kurdish one

785
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:38,091
A man who eat these votes
and for get me tomorrow,

786
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:40,629
who will only play with me,
I will not vote for this man,

787
01:21:40,664 --> 01:21:44,087
who only wants to
fill his pockets

788
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:48,900
You must support those
who support the poor

789
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:42,188
Now the Kurdish
leadership has grown fat

790
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:44,726
While the poor people
are moaning from hunger

791
01:22:44,761 --> 01:22:46,626
This is the truth

792
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,936
If it cannot be, it cannot be

793
01:22:58,039 --> 01:23:05,138
Now it will be hard for Kurds,
Sunna and Shia to liv e togethe r

794
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:14,145
The future of Iraq
will be in three pieces

795
01:23:22,464 --> 01:23:28,130
Iraq is not something
that you can cut into pieces

796
01:23:29,137 --> 01:23:31,105
Iraq is a country

797
01:23:31,773 --> 01:23:35,543
And how can you
cut a country into pieces?

798
01:23:35,578 --> 01:23:38,103
With a saw?

799
01:24:02,103 --> 01:24:05,436
Kurdistan is lik e Heaven
on Earth for the Kurds

800
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:11,179
We must protect Kurdistan
like our own eyes,

801
01:24:11,214 --> 01:24:16,583
and not let the enemy
invade Kurdistan

802
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:23,723
Those who rely God's grace,
God willing, they will succeed

803
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:28,052
If God is willing,
he will give us strength

804
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:53,477
By God, the spring is very nice,
the grass grows...

805
01:25:56,618 --> 01:25:58,449
I have for gotten many things

806
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:02,620
Things don't stay in my mind

807
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:06,528
When they tel I me
I was dreaming,

808
01:26:06,563 --> 01:26:08,614
I say,
"How can it be a dream?"

809
01:26:08,649 --> 01:26:10,665
"I've never seen such a dream"

810
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:12,530
and yet I had dreamed it

811
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:27,315
His father said,
"You must herd the sheep"

812
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:30,614
He had no choice,
so he left school

813
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:34,878
His future will burn

814
01:26:37,559 --> 01:26:43,191
I have no business
going to school

815
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:47,858
I'm the only one left

816
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:55,900
They won't take anyone
who's not a good brick cutter

817
01:26:56,744 --> 01:26:59,779
All these young
guys come searching

818
01:26:59,814 --> 01:27:04,251
with their mustaches
and their big muscles

819
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:10,888
From  morning until night
nobody gives them work

820
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:15,296
If they can't do even that work,
they just go home and lie down

821
01:27:15,331 --> 01:27:16,462
Always lying around...

822
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:20,490
But you must buiId your life
Isn't it so?

823
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:25,338
Now I work the brick ovens

824
01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:29,374
Then I tend the sheep

825
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:49,630
My father is getting old,
he can't work

826
01:27:49,665 --> 01:27:53,601
If we all went to school,
he'd do the work

827
01:27:53,636 --> 01:27:57,303
But we won't let him work

828
01:27:57,338 --> 01:28:01,968
He raised us all
Shouldn't we care for him now?

829
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:06,781
I'm tired
I eat quickly so I can lie down

830
01:28:06,816 --> 01:28:09,306
and fall asleep

831
01:28:38,946 --> 01:28:41,881
Now the war is over

832
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:51,458
Today, everything in Iraq
is control led by America

833
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:57,456
Nobody can escape
America's reach

834
01:29:29,664 --> 01:29:31,431
Two men are wrestling

835
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:36,563
Someone asks,
"Whose side is God on?"

836
01:29:40,074 --> 01:29:43,144
They answer, "God is always
on the side of the winner"

837
01:29:43,179 --> 01:29:47,513
Whoever wins,
God is on his side

838
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:12,096
I'm going
God be with you
