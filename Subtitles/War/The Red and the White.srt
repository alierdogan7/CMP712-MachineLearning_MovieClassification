00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,632
Give me a rifle!

45
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,877
So you don't want to do it?

46
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,316
But it has to be done!
Yes

47
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,314
One-two-one!

48
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,708
Go over to the left!

49
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,951
You've never agreed with me!

50
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,708
You only remember disagreements but we have agreed some

51
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,074
Slow down!
Stand there!

52
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,749
You're against me!

53
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,638
No, but man can fight and still be human.

54
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,712
You'll never see reason!

55
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,196
Take away my rifle.

Only since the company was routed.

68
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,631
Why did you join?

69
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,275
A comrade came to the camp.

70
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,913
A comrade came to the camp.

71
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,396

Was it me?

74
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,195
You said the Russian revolution
would bring ours closer

75
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,516
If we fought the officer's army

76
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,075
Our Russian brothers would help our cause.

77
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,634
With the step

00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,830
You can go and pray.

194
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,279
Clazunov, Lieutenant of the White Guards

195
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,070
Condemn under martial law

196
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:57,518
A Cossack ensign for assault on the civilian population!

197
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,395
Bury him.

198
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,189
Fire!

199
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,079
Come over here.

200
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,117
Come nearer.

201
00:33:52,320 --> 00:34:01,752
Come nearer.

202
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,319
Do you know who these men are?

203
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,911
They don't know!

204
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,670
I don't know!

205
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,270
Throw them in the water!

206
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,156
Do we have to throw these Reds in, too?
What did you say?

207
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,959
I said, stop here!

208
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,958
Do any of you speak Russian?

209
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,192
Can you walk?

210
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,432
We must record the names of the dead.

211
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,351
For their families.

212
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,115
I know them.

213
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,275
Who is your commander?

214
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,035
You can stay here
But don't dare speak your own language!

215
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,354
Now get them out of the water.

216
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,710
Get going.

217
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,630
Go back

218
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,513
We'll get the dead out!

219
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,550
We are fishing out the dead

220
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,874
Come here!
Here if you please.

221
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,556
Remember your oath?

222
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,557
Repeat the Hippocratic Oath!

223
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,675
I swear that as long as i live...

224
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,155
I shall not dishonor the society which i now join.

225
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,035
The society which i now join.

226
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,075
Tell the nurses to come here, please.

227
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,716
What are you doing here?

228
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,913
Please call them!

229
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,317
Stop!

230
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,755
You, here

231
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,318
you, here

232
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,952
And you here

233
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,871
You too

234
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,151
Yes, and you, too!

235
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,236
On the carriages, please.
Keep with you

236
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,791
Half-turn

237
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,234
Please

238
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,591
Music

239
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,114
You're very charming, young lady!

240
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,954
A waltz

241
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,357
Waltz

242
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,596
No gymanastic!

243
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,868
You are at liberty, madam!

244
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,360
You may go home!

245
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,516
Please...

246
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,515
Why don't you fire back, coward?

247
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,269
Come back Moujicks!!

248
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,590
Get back! You heard what i said!

249
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:39,599
Step forward those without arms!

250
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,595
One, two, three, drop your hands
One, two, three, hands up

251
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,310
One, two, three

252
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,431
One, two, three, hands up

253
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,348
One, two, three, hands up

254
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,029
What do you want?

255
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,588
What do you want?

256
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,994
You've no right to shoot them! We all ran! You too!

257
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,193
You scoundrel!

258
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,269
Drop your hands!

259
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,119
Obey my orders!

260
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,833
Fall in column of fours!

261
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,035

262
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,075
Go ahead!

263
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,479
Walk!

264
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,511
Mademoiselle!

265
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,352
Please come to look at my comrade.

266
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,591
He's very ill.

267
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,189
Come to the surgery.

268
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,553
That way.

269
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,955
Take off your shirt.

270
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,359
Please, may i have some hot water and tea?

271
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,837
What do you want?

272
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,355
The commander wants you to go.

273
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,551
Alone?

274
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,751
Report to the first calvary division

275
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,600
Twenty five men of the international second company

276
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,352
all wounded

277
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,717
And the commandant Sandor Varga

278
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,153
is in the hospital on River Pesetka

279
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,631
under the jurisdiction of White forces.

280
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,476
The area is strongly controlled. An attack is requested.
Is that all?

281
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,478
I repeat my orders: Report to the first calvary division...

282
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,950
Tu peux y aller!

283
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,951
You don't have to say you love me.

284
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,272
You don't...

285
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,909
Have to say you love me.

286
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,637
I want to undress for you.

287
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,749
Hide!

288
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,517
Hide!

289
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,996
What are you doing?

290
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,760
To bathe.

291
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,478
Go ahead. I'll watch you!

292
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,711
I don't want you to!

293
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,279
Go on! I want to look at you!

294
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,877
Go away! Aren't you ashamed?

295
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,316
Excavate everywhere
Catch him!

296
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,480
Halte!

297
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,755
What are you doing here?

298
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,629
Turn to face me!

299
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,072
Face me, I said!

300
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,392
Can you swim?

301
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,920
Swim, then!

302
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,750
Water spirits!

303
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,515
Come over here!

304
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,671
Help her!

305
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,673
Help her!

306
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,718
Stand there!

307
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,629
Do you know him? A Red internationalist, isn't he?

308
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,195
Get going!

309
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,031
Listen, Red!

310
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,240
Who are you?
Hungarian.

311
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,549
Sing something.

312
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,638
Don't you understand?

313
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,753
Sing!

314
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,913
Black clouds roll across the sky

315
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,758
where Hungarian lads now live and die.

316
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,430
Suffit!

317
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:33,511
Know any more?
Yes

318
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:38,158
To the White Guards i wrote, in my own hand

319
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,757
leave in peace the lovely Soviet land!

320
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,193
But as it seems they don't take good advice...

321
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:51,838
Our next words go with bullets to the Whites!

322
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,476
What song is that?

323
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,070
Jump in!

324
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,591
Jump!

325
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,591
I am Staff Captain Tachelpanov of Counter-intellignece

326
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,672
I'm Guards Colonel Kedrov.

327
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:31,950
Which regiment?
Orenburg

328
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,875
You seem to be recovering, colonel.

329
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,598
Don't you wish to rejoin your regiment?

330
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,910
Are Reds here?

331
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,951
Reds are here!

332
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,633
Kindly take your place.

333
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,278
All of you go down there, please.

334
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,679
Kindly step this way.

335
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,233
Please separate the Reds from the Whites.

336
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:10,436
There are no Reds or Whites here, only patients.

337
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,953
Kindly go down to the landing stage.

338
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,755
The rest come here!

339
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:51,198
You! Come to me!

340
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,831
Kindly separate the Reds from the Whites.

341
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:05,671
The rest go back.

342
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,189
Move forward

343
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,315
He isn't a Red!

344
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,000
He isn't a Red!

345
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,832
Jump!

346
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:54,910
I'm making you for the last time kindly separate them!

347
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,349
Staff Captain! The platoon is ready!

348
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,596
Staff Captain! The nurse is separating the Reds!

349
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:00,870
Please come here!

350
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,951
Please turn away. This is no sight for you.

351
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,597
This is no sight for you.

352
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,080
The Reds are separated!

353
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:21,640
Your pistol please.

354
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,197
Wait!

355
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,908
Row to the bank!
Quickly!

356
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,033
Behind

357
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,759
Throw down your gun and crawl here, you scoundrel!

358
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:34,832
All those who can walk, fall in!

359
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,708
A fine horse for you, commander!

360
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,033
One horse won't take us far!

361
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:34,119
Are you Russian?
I'm Hungarian

362
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,350
Give me your rifle!

363
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,919
Commander!

364
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,237
I and 12 of my men

365
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,790
wish to join you!

366
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:14,550
Are you the twelve?

367
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,479
So you want to join us?

368
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,918
Et vous, mon colonel,

369
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:52,312
And you, Colonel? Do you want to join us, too?

370
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,675
Frankly, no.

371
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,912
Well, no is no.

372
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,990
Right turn!

373
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,309
Hands up!

374
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,154
Line up there!

375
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:13,673
Baissez les bras.

376
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,393
Alignez-vous.

377
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:23,114
Those who are frightened can dismiss!

378
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,752
You can pick the man to shoot you!

379
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,196
Please, all of you go away!

380
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,678
She's not guilty! She was forced!

381
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:22,874
Must I order you individually?

382
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,071
No one can be forced into treason!

383
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,833
We must split into two groups!

384
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,678
One takes the woods, the other crosses the Volga.

385
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:40,757
We'll toss!
Heads!

386
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,556
The woods. Pick your men.

387
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,271
Hungarians will come with me.

388
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,069
Who is Hungarian?

389
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,519
Answer!

390
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,832
Hungarians with me! You too!

391
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,872
Come here!

392
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,348
Single file!

393
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,355
Stay!

394
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,391
Kiss me!

395
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:34,949
You kiss well.

396
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,999
Afraid of me, aren't you?

397
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:48,075
You think I'll die soon?

398
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,149
I won't die!

399
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,674
You and you! Come with me.

400
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:48,790
The others stay here!
Come back everybody!

401
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,235
Across to the river.

402
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,512
Hide in the rye!

403
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:05,437
Hide in the rye!

404
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,514
Move back!

405
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,193
Move back!

406
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:30,312
In five file!

407
01:18:53,080 --> 01:19:03,194
Allons enfants de la patrie...
