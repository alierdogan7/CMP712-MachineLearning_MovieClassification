1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,991
(birdsong)

2
00:00:08,659 --> 00:00:11,959
Goodnight Mister Tom

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,751
(church bells)

4
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:19,018
John Thaw

5
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:25,949
Nick Robinson

6
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,598
Get your hands out of your pockets.

7
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,437
(wireless playing music)

8
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,151
(interference)

9
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,670
"..SEEDS, WAIT UNTIL..."

10
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,076
- (gasps)
- Sorry about that!

11
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,231
"This is London."

12
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,956
"You will now hear a statement
by the Prime Minister."

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,958
(Chamberlain) "I am speaking to you...

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,629
..from the cabinet room
at 10 Downing Street."

15
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,470
"This morning
the British Ambassador in Berlin...

16
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,150
..handed the German Government
a final note...

17
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,149
..stating that, unless we heard
from them by 11 o'clock...

18
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,274
..that they were prepared at once
to withdraw their troops from Poland,...

19
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,030
..a state of war would exist between us."

20
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,950
"I have to tell you now that
no such undertaking has been received...

21
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,508
..and that, consequently,...

22
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,870
..this country is at war with Germany."

23
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,953
Give them an inch, they take a yard!

24
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,391
Excuse me.

25
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,515
Oh, um, Mr Oakley... I thought
I spotted you sitting at the back there.

26
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,872
Only, um, you've heard that
our choirmaster, Walter Wingate,...

27
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,514
- ..has just been called up...
- No.

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,233
Which presents us with
a bit of a problem.

29
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,508
Oh.

30
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,155
I have it on good authority
you're something of a musician yourself?

31
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,191
I used to play the organ a bit...

32
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,837
..if that's what you mean. Doesn't mean
I know about choirs. Or would want to.

33
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,394
We all have to do our bit. It's your duty.

34
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,157
And when I need you to tell me what
my duty is, Mrs Ford, I'll let you know.

35
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,750
At least tell me you'll think about it,
Mr Oakley.

36
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,711
I'll think about it.

37
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:46,897
(train whistle)

38
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,471
(barking)

39
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,111
(train whistle)

40
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,591
(guard's whistle)

41
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,071
Now wait here.

42
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,311
(knock at door)

43
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,952
Well?

44
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,391
- You realise I am the billeting officer of this area?
- What's that to do with me?

45
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,317
His name is William Beech.

46
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,557
His mother will only let him be evacuated
if he's with someone...

47
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,194
..who's religious or lives near a church.

48
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,472
And the Home Office says
it is obligatory to take one.

49
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,431
I'm sorry, but he has to go somewhere.

50
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,471
You'd best come in, then.

51
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,319
Come on.

52
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,995
Well, take your mac off.

53
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,433
Look,...

54
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,074
..if you've had enough,...

55
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,475
..leave it.

56
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,795
(slurping)

57
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,916
So, where you from?

58
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,311
London.

59
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,958
Look, er, I have to go out. You'll be
all right for a bit on your own, will ya?

60
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,479
Yeah.

61
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,317
Right.

62
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,959
Have a look outside if you want.

63
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,391
(door closes)

64
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,271
(church bell)

65
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,831
(bicycle bell)

66
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,154
I'm not having him and that's that.

67
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,270
What do I know about kids?

68
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,711
Excuse me, Mr Oakley, you have got him,
whether you like it or not.

69
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,673
And if you don't,
you'll just have to lump it, won't you?

70
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,038
I wasn't happy about leaving the child
with you, either,...

71
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,436
..but it's a case of needs must, Mr Oakley.

72
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,234
There's not another spare room
in the entire village.

73
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,274
- Then try another village.
- That is out of the question!

74
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,108
We all have to put our shoulders
to the wheel. Even you.

75
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,629
There is a war on, you know!

76
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,035
Mr Oakley, about the choir practice.

77
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,072
Yes, I've said I'll try and be there.

78
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,635
Hello!

79
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,116
- You're one of the London lot, aren't you?
- Yes, miss.

80
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,071
A regular wild bunch, I've heard.

81
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,317
- (man) What's your name, then?
- William Beech.

82
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,876
Well, William Beech, I expect
I'll be seeing you in my class shortly.

83
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,115
And it's not Miss, it's Mrs.

84
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,151
Mrs Hartridge, all right?

85
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,718
- Who are you billeted with?
- He lives there.

86
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,390
Oh. You mean Tom.

87
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,399
Well... Goodbye, William.

88
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,231
(barking)

89
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,993
Get away!

90
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,031
Get away or I'll kill ya!

91
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,390
We'll have no talk about killin'! All right?

92
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,034
I reckon we've enough of that already!

93
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,918
Now, as far as the dog's concerned,...

94
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,269
..it's my dog there.

95
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,550
His name's Sammy,...

96
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,398
..and he's soft as me pocket, really.

97
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,036
So don't you go takin'
no more sticks to him.

98
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,355
Do you hear?

99
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,952
Well, now what?

100
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,513
(poker sizzling)

101
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,912
(barking)

102
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,679
Well, surely he never thought...

103
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,391
(church bell)

104
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,836
"Dear Sir or Madam,...

105
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,873
..I asked if Willie could stay
with God-fearing people,...

106
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,478
..so I hope he has."

107
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,957
"Like most boys he's full of sin,
but he has promised to be good."

108
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,470
"But, just in case, I've put the belt in."

109
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,191
Goodnight, then.

110
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,631
Goodnight, mister.

111
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,791
You can... call me Tom.

112
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,071
Goodnight, Mister Tom!

113
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,151
(digging)

114
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,359
Sorry, mister.

115
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,991
Get them wet things off.

116
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,110
And the jacket.

117
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,553
Now, here's the post office.

118
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,959
If you just get a stamp
and, er, post this for me...

119
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,390
..while I have a quick word
with the doctor.

120
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,960
- Your mum won't be able to read that.
- Yes, she will. She's got one of these, too.

121
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,390
And this way, you see,
you get twice as much on.

122
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,433
Thank you.

123
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,989
You see, when I got him up this morning
I found he'd wet the bed.

124
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,634
A not uncommon occurrence, Tom,...

125
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:33,550
..with a child who's been ripped out of his
home and dumped in some alien place.

126
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,955
What am I supposed to do about it?

127
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,639
- What we're all having to do, Tom.
- Oh?

128
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,275
The best we can under the circumstances.

129
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,031
So, what's your name?

130
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,072
William. William Beech. What's yours?

131
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,113
Zacharias Wrench.
My parents' idea of a joke, I think.

132
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,151
But you can call me Zach.

133
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,033
- Who've they put you with?
- Mister Tom.

134
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,392
I'm here with the doctor and his wife.
Friends of my mum and dad's.

135
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,750
It'll come in handy, I suppose,
if I'm ever ill.

136
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,511
- All right?
- Yeah.

137
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,118
Come on, then.

138
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,594
- See you around.
- Yeah. Bye.

139
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,271
Good lads!

140
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,278
- Have you got your Anderson up yet?
- It's been delivered.

141
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,676
I'll send the lads round if you like,
give you a hand.

142
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,837
- I can manage, thanks.
- Who said you couldn't?

143
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,278
You still a member of that knitting circle
round at the church?

144
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,311
Of course.

145
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,191
Only, you'll have heard I've been landed
with one of these evacuees.

146
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,832
Talk of the village!

147
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,871
I'll bet.

148
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,152
The only clothes he's got
are what he's standing up in, you see.

149
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,351
You haven't gotta clothe 'em, you know!

150
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,356
I wasn't planning to.

151
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,951
It's just that...

152
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,196
..I was wondering if,...

153
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,392
..between you, you could
rustle him up a couple of things.

154
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,192
I'll think about it.

155
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,269
- What's all this?
- Me mam sent 'em, for young William.

156
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,676
There's no way our George
can get into 'em any more.

157
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,711
Right. Thanks.

158
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,911
- See you later, Mr Oakley.
- Will ya?

159
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,999
- Give you a hand with the Anderson.
- Oh. That.

160
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,431
(door closes)

161
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,878
- For me?
- Well, who else?

162
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,393
Well, come on, let's see if they fit.

163
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,991
Never mind.

164
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,231
Come on, then.

165
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,511
(Sammy whimpering)

166
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,311
(digging)

167
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,556
Now I thought you were
supposed to be helpin'.

168
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,797
- My new shirt'll get dirty.
- Then take it off!

169
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,911
Go and change it, then.

170
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,672
Aren't you roastin'
in that jumper, William?

171
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,392
No.

172
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,036
He's got a temperature. Trying to sweat it
out of himself if you must know.

173
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,109
Come on, chop-chop!
Want this finishin' by tonight!

174
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,949
I'm going over to the church for a bit.
Back in about an hour. All right?

175
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,069

177
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:08,554
# And did those feet in ancient time

178
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,795
Just a minute, just a minute!

179
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,592
I mean,...

180
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,191
..have I been wastin' my time
these last months or what?

181
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,993
It's upliftin' people want, not buryin'!

182
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,750
Now start again.
Let's put a bit of beef into it this time.

183
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,190
Some sort of problem, is there,
Mr Oakley?

184
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,629
Nothin' I can't sort out...

185
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,590
..if left to get on with it.

186
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,192
Right.

187
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,078
Now, this time, I wanna hear you.

188
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,190
All right?

189
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,231
So...

190
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,351
# And did those feet

191
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,756
# in ancient time

192
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,636
# Walk upon England's mountains green

193
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,791
# And was the holy Lamb of God

194
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:18,799
# On England's pleasant pastures seen!

195
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,789
# And did the countenance divine

196
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:31,995
# Shine forth upon our clouded hills?

197
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:39,399
# And was Jerusalem builded here

198
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:47,999
# Among those dark satanic mills?

199
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:00,629
# Bring me my bow of burning gold

200
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:07,234
# Bring me my arrows of desire

201
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:14,558
# Bring me my spear: O clouds unfold

202
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:21,472
# Bring me my chariot of fire!

203
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,799
# I will not cease from mental fight

204
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,958
# Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand

205
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:43,716
# Till we have built Jerusalem

206
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:52,078

William!

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,631
William!

211
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,157
Have you no more sense than
to be out here at this time of night!

212
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,079
- D'you wanna catch your death!
- You said we had to finish it tonight.

213
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,917
What?

214
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,914
All right, come inside, then.

215
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,951
Come on.

216
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,551

218
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,028
Don't ever touch that instrument again
without my permission.

219
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,071
Is that clear?

00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,991
Look,...

00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,673
..I'm going fishin' this afternoon
if you want to come.

222
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,991
Need any help?

223
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,952
I think I can just about manage, thanks.

224
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,797
Is Will about?

225
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,035
- Will?
- My name for William.

226
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,389
I think Willie sounds silly.

227
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,431
So, is Will in?

228
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,232
- We were just off out, actually.
- Oh. Going somewhere nice?

229
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,753
- Fishin'.
- Really? Can I come?

230
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,792
Afternoon.

231

- Is your dad really an actor?
- And my mum.

233
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,152
Course, Dad's an auxiliary fireman now.

234
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,599

235
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,548
Wow!

236
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,878
Mrs Hartridge's husband's a pilot.

237
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,036
I wish I was.

Well, cheer up.

00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,352
It's only school you're goin' off to.

241
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,391
Not your own hangin'.

242
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,675
Got everythin', have ya?

243
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,399
Right.

244
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,631
Off you go, then.

Will!

248
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,271
I'm sorry, William.

249
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,550
It's the door just across the hall.

250
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,397

251
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,998
William!

252
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,190
(door closes)

253
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,359
What's the matter?

254
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,355
They put me with the babies.

255
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,391
(children playing)

256
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,991
Can we have a word?

257
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,556
Of course, Mr Oakley.

258
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,309
William tells me you've put him
in the babies' class.

259
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,430
That's right, Mr Oakley.

260
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,758
Would you tell me why, when you've got
all his friends in your class.

261
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,791
Because they can read and write.

262
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,433
Now, join up the dots...

263
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,948
..and see what you end up with.

264
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,631
Never mind.

265
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,592
Now,...

266
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,312
..try again.

267
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,351
Only this time...

268
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,471
..take your time.

269
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,154
Don't try stabbin' it to death.

270
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,394
Here y'are. Have another go.

271
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,395
It's bad, innit?

272
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,437
No, it isn't. Not bad at all!

273
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,831
Just get on with the next one.

274
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,797
That's it.

275
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,912
There you are!

276
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,076
You've written your own name!

277
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,076
Oh, Mister Tom!

278
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,758
Now... draw a line under that
and get it copied.

279
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,158
Only, before you do,
just you draw me another line.

280
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,669
Them's straighter than I can do with
a ruler! Wherever did you learn to do that?

281
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,393
Just did it.

282
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,195
Go on, then, get it copied.

283
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,879
Won't I go to hell?

284
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,638
Hell?

285
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,274
You go to hell if you copy, don't ya?

286
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,835
- It's cheatin'.
- Whatever lunatic told you that!

287
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,271
Never mind. Just do it.

288
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,757
And if a chap with horns and a pitchfork
comes looking for ya,...

289
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,836
..blame me. All right?

290
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,191
"The... Tinder Box."

291
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,674
"A soldier was marchin'
along the high road..."

292
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,109
"Right-left, right-left."

293
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,788
"Everybody used to mock him
and make fun of him."

294
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,356
"The eldest son wanted to go
and cut wood."

295
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,549
"The kingdom was cer... cer... cer...

296
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,469
..cert-certainly very small."

297
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,471
What's it say, Mister Tom?

298
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,676
"In loving memory of Rachel Oakley,...

299
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,394
..aged 27 years."

300
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,909
"A dearly beloved wife."

301
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,598
"Also John Oakley, aged five years."

302
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,869
"A dear son. Now with God."

303
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,471
And did they just die?

304
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,109
No. They caught scarlatina.

305
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,071
What's scarlatina?

306
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,111
A disease.

307
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,957
A killer.

308
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,389
At least in them days.

309
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,795
Two weeks it was all over,...

310
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,070
..or so I'm told.

311
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,432
- Why didn't you catch it?
- Because I wasn't here, was I?

312
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,633
No. I was on a ship on convoy duty.

313
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,995
Fightin' for King and country, as they say.

314
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,678
No way of gettin' home, of course.

315
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,391
In fact, by the time I did,
they was already in the ground.

316
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,590
What was he like - John?

317
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,272
He was bright as a button!

318
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,351
Sharp as sixpence!

319
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,789
Bit naughty sometimes, but...

320
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,871
..full of life... to the brim.

321
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,117
In fact, very much like her, really.

322
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,151
Anyway, what's this?

323
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,034
Out here in your 'jamas,
and not even dressed yet!

324
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,799
- I wanted to show you something.
- Oh?

325
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,432
Come on!

326
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,319
Come on!

327
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,797
Well?

328
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,229
Dry, Mister Tom! It's dry!

329
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,798
That's great, William!

330
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,956
That's really great!

331
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,230
Somebody's birthday, is it?

332
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,556
Been steaming 'em open again, Matthew?

333
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:04,116
- Any from London?
- Never noticed any London postmarks.

334
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,355
You do surprise me.

335
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,758
- Two and six?!
- This is quality stuff, Mr Oakley.

336
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:23,355
I suppose it was only a matter of time,
once the war had started,...

337
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,518
..before the profiteers started
comin' out the woodwork.

338
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,551
Thank you.

339
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,791
(thunder)

340
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,352
So this is where
you've been hiding yourself!

341
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,995
You realise your tea's been
on the table for half an hour?

342
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,110
Sorry, Mister Tom.

343
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,673
I should think you are!

344

345
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,630
# Happy birthday to you!

346
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,599
# Happy birthday, dear William!

347
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,514
# Happy birthday to you!

(applause/cheering)

349
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,679
Go on, then! Blow!

350
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,712
If you blow them all out,
you get to make a wish.

351
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,356
- You can't tell anybody cos...
- Just blow the damn things out, William.

352
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,193

353
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,632
Who's going to have the very last bun?

354
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,150
Anybody want the last rock cake?

355
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,316
(laughter)

356
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,955
- Didn't she even send him a card, then?
- Nothing.

357
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,399
Shame on her!

358
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,476
Now come on, let's have a tune out of you.

359
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,108
Come on, Alice.
You know better than to ask that.

360
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,391
Rachel wouldn't thank you
for lettin' it rot away...

361
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,798
..just cos she's not here to play it
any more. You can't grieve for ever, Tom.

362
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,594
(children laughing/shouting)

363
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,275
(Zach) Pop it! Go on, pop the balloon!

364
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,309
(pop!)

365
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,476
(cheering)

366
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,153
(boy) Cor, look,
that one's a bright one, innit!

367
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,914
(boy) Pass me that scone over!

368
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,718
(# "It's A Long Way To Tipperary")

369
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,591
#..to Tipperary

370
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,188
# It's a long way to go

371
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,558
# It's a long way to Tipperary

372
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,394
# To the sweetest girl I know

373
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,598
# Goodbye, Piccadilly

374
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,349
# Farewell, Leicester Square

375
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,598
# It's a long, long way to Tipperary

376
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,553
# But my heart's right there

377
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,158
(cheering)

378
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,952
Well done, Tom!

379
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,234
- Night!
- Night, William!

380
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,313
Oh, and er...
this is for you as well, by the way.

381
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,954
Nearly forgot to give it to ya.

382
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,476
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks, Mister Tom.

383
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,678
This has been the best time
I've had in my whole life.

384
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,157
(retching)

385
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,991
(William vomiting)

386
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,349
Obviously.

387
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,391
(school bell)

388
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,871
Come in.

389
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,313
Mrs Black said I were to see you
before I went home.

390
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,351
That's right, William.

391
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,874
I've got a bit of news for you.

392
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,752
Mister Tom, I've been moved up
to Mrs Hartridge's class!

393
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,675
She says I can read and write
good enough now!

394
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,034
It's from your mum, William.

395
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,834
Seems she's not been very well.

396
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,472
Wants you back.

397
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,999
Whoa...

398
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,798
Where have they come from, Mister Tom?

399
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,910
A place called Dunkirk.

400
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,396
Lucky to get out alive, I heard.

401
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,151
Walk on!

402
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,191
(train whistle)

403
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,074
Now don't forget to write.

404
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:39,955
And, um... if you change your mind
about them paintings of yours...

405
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,595
..just let me know and I'll post 'em to ya.
All right?

406
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:48,191
They belong here with you. And they'll
be here when I get back, won't they?

407
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,879
Course they will.

408
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,388
I will be comin' back,...

409
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,431
..won't I?

410
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,431
Course you will!

411
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,632
Now you just take good care of yourself,
d'you hear?

412
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,154
You just... take your time.

413
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,152
You haven't seen your mother
for a few months, so...

414
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,192
..it's bound to be a bit awkward at first.

415
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,271
I'll miss ya.

416
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,191
- You'll make sure he gets off all right?
- Don't worry.

417
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,591
(train whistle)

418
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:17,273
(Tannoy) Stand clear for the train arriving
at platform one.

419
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,556
Here you are, then, son. Rise and shine!

420
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,875
Willie?

421
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,271
You look different.

422
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,719
Put weight on.

423
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:07,870
- I'll take that for you.
- I'll say what to take and not to take!

424
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,468
So, how are you feelin' now?

425
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,795
Fine. I'm fine!

426
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,515
- Only, they said you was ill.
- Did they?

427
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,949
So, what you got in the bag, then?

428
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,549
Just me things.
And a present for you from Mister Tom.

429
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,195
- Mr Tom?
- Mr Oakley. The man I stays with.

430
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,631
- I don't need charity, thank you!
- It's just some bed socks!

431
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,036
And Mrs Little, the doctor's wife,
sent tonic wine.

432
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,675
Wine?! Haven't I told you
about the evils of drink!

433
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,757
It ain't a real drink, like you get in a pub.

434
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,792
It's got iron in it
to help get your strength back.

435
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,913
And what would you know about
what you get in a pub?

436
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,715
When we get 'ome,
I want no noise from you. All right?

437
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,159
Why?

438
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,478
Cos nobody has to know
that you're 'ere, that's why.

439
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:20,113
And when we get inside
I've got a surprise for ya.

440
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,478
(keys)

441
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,791
What's that smell?

442
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,831
What smell?

443
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,031
Doesn't matter.

444
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,514
Not a dog, is it, this surprise?

445
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:02,872
- What surprise?
- This surprise you've got for me.

446
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,480
It's over there, in the box.

447
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,039
It's a baby!

448
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,275
It's a present from Jesus.

449
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,833
(baby crying)

450
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,633
Don't you dare!

451
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,993
- A bit of discipline, that's all she needs.
- She's just a baby, Mum!

452
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,234
Sit down!

453
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,639
Now!

454
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:44,099
My God! Isn't my life bad enough as it is!
Stuck 'ere on me own in this 'ouse,...

455
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,359
..frightened out of me head half the time,...

456
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,473
- ..without you starting!
- What are you afraid of? The air raids?

457
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,556
The air raids(!)

458
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,479
If we're killed, we're killed.
That's God's will, right?

459
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,671
So what are you frightened of, then?

460
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,439
By what's goin' on out there, of course!

461
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,270
Oh, Willie, if you knew... If you only knew
what's goin' on out there!

462
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,311
The filth!

463
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,031
The risin' tide... of filth!

464
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,958
Perhaps you should see somebody, Mum.

465
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,991
Like who?

466
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,476
Like an 'ead doctor?
That's what you think, is it?

467
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,195
That I'm off my 'ead
cos I know what's goin' on out there?

468
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,437
You keep a civil tongue in your head,
my lad,...

469
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,471
..or else.

470
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:36,277
You have brought it back, haven't ya?

471
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,799
The belt?

472
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,558
I forgot.

473
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,397
Liar.

474
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,669
Liar!

475
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,472
Aghh!

476
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,637
You left it behind on purpose, didn't ya?

477
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,079
No, Mum! Honest!

478
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:52,396
But I can get another.
I know a shop that sells lots of 'em.

479
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,670
Now get upstairs out of my sight!

480
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,791
(baby crying)

481
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,795
And you can shut up an' all!

482
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,511
(crying continues)

483
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,191
(cat screeching)

484
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,279
(baby grizzling)

485
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,591
Your favourite.

486
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,957
Certainly got your appetite back, anyway.

487
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,992
Must be all that fresh air, I expect.

488
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:35,791
Ohh... such a beautiful baby
you were, though.

489
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,788
Proud as punch I was,
wheelin' you out in your pram.

490
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:45,470
Sun shinin', people stoppin'...
Just stoppin', just to look at you.

491
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,274
Where'd you get him from, then, missis?
Heaven?

492
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:53,199
Happiest days
of my entire life then, Willie.

493
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,471
Finished?

494
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,117
Mum...

495
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,674
- What's this?
- My present to ya.

496
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,349
- It was Mister Tom's idea.
- Mr Tom?

497
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,676
I told ya, the man I stay with down there.

498
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,071
Well, go on, open it.

499
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,995
It's where I live down there.

500
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,796
Did you steal this?

501
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,274
- I did it meself!
- Liar!

502
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:50,312
- I did, Mum! Honest I did!
- And these?

503
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:54,319
Where did these come from?
Did you steal these as well?

504
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:59,593
- They're presents from Ginnie and Carrie!
- Girls? You've been mixing with girls?!

505
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:03,679
They're nice, Mum, and they
all go to church. Except Zach.

506
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,756
- Zach?
- He's me best friend.

507
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:10,237
- Why doesn't he go to church?
- They ain't got one there. A synagogue.

508
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,793
A synagogue?

509
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:15,958
- That's what they call their church.
- He's Jewish?

510
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,912
You've been consorting with Jews?

511
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,750
What's wrong with Jews, Mum? Like Zach
says, Jesus was a Jew, wasn't he?

512
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,473
Blasphemer... Blasphemer!

513
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:29,512
You know what we do with blasphemers!

514
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,232
No, Mum! Please!

515
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,511
Not there! Please, Mum! Not there!

516
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,511
(baby cries)

517
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,788
(# It's A Long Way To Tipperary"
played sadly)

518
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:17,638
(wireless) "Right across the city, German
raiders are leaving blazing buildings."

519
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,470
"Overhead I can hear the pulsing drone
of the circling bombers."

520
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:27,514
"In the shelters, men, women and children
listen to the muffled sounds...

521
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,154
..of bombs and anti-aircraft fire."

522
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,671
Mr Oakley?

523
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,551
Still no news, then?

524
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,511
'Fraid not.

525
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:49,518
Sorry, Tom.
Still nothin' from London, I'm afraid.

526
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,074
What's it been? Weeks now, eh?

527
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:55,271
Bit of bad news for Mrs Hartridge...

528
01:00:55,320 --> 01:01:00,678
..up at the school. That young husband
of hers - one who flies Spits?

529
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,553
Missing, believed dead.

530
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,591
Ohh...!

531
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,552
Contact him, Mr Oakley?

532
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:15,388
I thought I'd have heard from him by now,
you see.

533
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,431
It's been over a month.

534
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,233
It does tend to happen like that, you know.

535
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,829
Once they get back into
the home environment.

536
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,839
And only natural for a boy of that age,
I suppose,...

537
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,519
..to prefer to be with his own.

538
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,191
(train whistle)

539
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,071
(air-raid siren)

540
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,993
Get a move on there!
Everybody down in the shelter!

541
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:00,238
- Lost, are we, sir?
- Looks like it.

542
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:04,990
Never mind about that now.
Let's get down the shelter. Come on.

543
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,837
Come on.

544
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,271
Come on, hurry up!

545
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:25,388
I'm sorry, mate,
no dogs allowed in the shelter.

546
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,079
So what am I supposed to do with him?

547
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,112
Leave him out here to be blown to bits?

548
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,191
Oh, come on, then.

549
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,470
And he definitely didn't run away,
you say?

550
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:53,150
Only it happens all the time,
kids takin' off, comin' back to London.

551
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,191
No question of that.

552
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:59,233
Look, I just wanna make sure
he's all right, that's all.

553
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,273
And you've got an address for him
round here, have you?

554
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:13,070
Well, tomorrow mornin', God willin',
we'll see if we can find him.

555
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,111
(explosion)

556
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,390
(baby cries)

557
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,431
(all-clear siren)

558
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,791
(ambulance bell)

559
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,189
Young couple, just married.

560
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:11,993
He was home on embarkation leave.

561
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,995
- And are they... are they both...?
- Oh, yeah.

562
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,394
Bloody, bloody war.

563
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:25,757
Well, I suppose you'll be wantin'
to find this kid of yours.

564
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,758
- If it's not...
- Just give me 10 minutes.

565
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,791
Of course.

566
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,831
(knocks on door)

567
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,952
If it's Mrs Beech you want, she's not 'ere.

568
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,958
- D'you know where she's gone?
- The coast, she said.

569
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,118
- And the boy? Did he go with her?
- Can't remember seein' a boy.

570
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:11,072
Little lad. 10 years old.

571
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:15,796
Oh, young Willie, you mean!
Evacuated to the country, last I heard.

572
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,751
Probably just as well.

573
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:22,351
Quiet boy, no friends as such,
bullied a lot. Sittin' target, really.

574
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,311
I mean,...

575
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:27,477
..this house... real house of mystery.

576
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,796
You hear some funny things sometimes.

577
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:36,312
- What sort of things?
- Well, whimpers sometimes. Bumps.

578
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:40,399
- Bumps?
- Like somebody humpin' furniture about.

579
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:45,594
- Well, people do move furniture about.
- At three o'clock in the mornin'?

580
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:48,916
- So when did you last see her?
- About a week ago.

581
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:54,353
I was shocked when she condescended
to speak to me. Talk about la-di-da!

582
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,949
- (whining)
- There's nobody in there, Rover.

583
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,831
(Sammy whining)

584
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:04,793
Not like him to make a fuss
over nothin', though.

585
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,189
Smell somethin', do ya?

586
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:16,032
Er, look, I'll see if I can find a copper.

587
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,111
Oi! Hang on a minute!

588
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,872
Cor! What died in 'ere, then!

589
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,511
(Sammy whining)

590
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,151
Quiet, Sam.

591
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,551
(Sammy still whining)

592
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,951
'Ere, let me.

593
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,511
(gasps)

594
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:01,151
God Almighty!
What the hell's been goin' on 'ere?

595
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,831
(coughing)

596
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,912
All right, let me have the baby, son.

597
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,951
Get away!

598
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,351
Let me.

599
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,389
What's his name, then, William?

600
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:44,319
It's a her. I call her Trudy.

601
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,595
Trudy.

602
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,438
That's a nice name.

603
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,678
Are you gonna let me have a hold, then?

604
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,991
Why didn't you come?
I kept callin' for you but you didn't come.

605
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,391
(ambulance bell)

606
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,560
- Are you related to this child?
- No.

607
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,034
- Then who are you?
- The one who found him.

608
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,877
Just in time, I'd say.

609
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,388
(Tannoy) Dr Westward to Casualty.

610
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:29,432
Take him to Children's.
See that he gets a tetanus.

611
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:32,153
What the hell is that dog doing in here?

612
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:35,715
You really will have to get that animal
out of here.

613
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,230
I won't be far away, don't you worry.

614
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:48,993
Tom!

615
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:51,231
How is he?

616
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,189
Any news about the mother?

617
01:10:55,240 --> 01:11:00,439
No. But it'll be prison for her, I reckon,
when they do catch up with her.

618
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,950
- Is there a husband?
- There was once, apparently.

619
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,992
Found dead in an alley.
Choked on his own vomit.

620
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:10,635
His idea of family life
was drinkin' hisself silly,...

621
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,911
..then comin' home and
usin' her as a punchbag.

622
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:17,509
The kid as well, I shouldn't wonder.

623
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:22,759
- Go back to the country now, will you?
- Not without William, I won't.

624
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,793
(screaming)

625
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,671
Keep an eye on him, will ya?

626
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,711
- Of course.
- Thanks.

627
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,351
(Sammy whines)

628
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,234
He's in deep shock, Mr Oakley.

629
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,750
We've had to keep him well sedated,
I'm afraid.

630
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,116
Well...

631
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,549
Saves combin', I suppose.

632
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,352
(visitors' bell)

633
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,391
How are you feelin' now?

634
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,071
I had a nightmare.

635
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,829
They stuck this needle in me.

636
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:42,792
Can't I come home with you, Mister Tom?

637
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,957
I'm afraid you have to leave now.

638
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,594
Don't go! Stay a bit more!

639
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:55,513
Now you just concentrate
on gettin' yourself better. All right?

640
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,154
Not something I have a lot of faith in,
myself - drugging them.

641
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:06,556
- You'll be Mister Tom, then.
- Tom Oakley.

642
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:11,469
My name's Stelton. I'm a psychiatrist.
I work with the children's home.

643
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:16,036
Our feeling is that he'd benefit
from treatment there.

644
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,071
What sort of treatment?

645
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,111
Psychiatric treatment.

646
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,674
I'd like him to come back home with me.

647
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:27,157
As I understand it, you aren't
actually related to him, Mr Oakley.

648
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,670
Are there any other relatives
who'd take him in?

649
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:34,554
- That's something we'd have to go into.
- And if there aren't?

650
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:38,479
As I said, there is the children's home.

651
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,317
Woof!

652
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,271
Won't be long.

653
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:44,831
(Sammy whines)

654
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,517
(barking)

655
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,551
Quiet! Quiet!

656
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,191
Woof-woof!

657
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:05,230
Mister Tom... how did I get 'ere?

658
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,271
I kidnapped ya.

659
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,912
Oh.

660
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,397
That's what I did, boy, I kidnapped ya.

661
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,468
I kidnapped ya!

662
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:26,312
I KIDNAPPED YA...!

663
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:34,034
They seem to have patched you up
pretty well at the hospital, William.

664
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:38,596
Now you just settle down and
I'll call in again tomorrow. All right?

665
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,958
The sores will soon heal, of course.

666
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,595
It's the wounds inside
that we need to worry about.

667
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:55,474
You do realise they're bound
to come looking for him?

668
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:59,593
No...! They're far too busy
to go chasin' evacuees.

669
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:04,794
Besides, they didn't even know
he was in London. She saw to that.

670
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:10,154
- Goodnight, then, Tom.
- Goodnight, Doctor.

671
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:13,397
And you will let young Zach
know he's back?

672
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,637
You mean he hasn't been round here yet?

673
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,434
No! No! No! No! No!

674
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,313
No! No! Get away!

675
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,353
Hey...!

676
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:26,549
Hey!

677
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,353
Hey, hey, hey! Come on now, come on!

678
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,994
It's him, Mister Tom! It's him!

679
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:47,071
How are you feelin'?

680
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,111
I wanna come down.

681
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,351
All right.

682
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,632
- Ahh!
- Oh! Oh, dear!

683
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:12,713
It's all right, all right. Get back in.

684
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,751
There we are.

685
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,873
Don't worry. Don't worry.
They'll get stronger.

686
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,871
There we are.

687
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,469
- Don't you ever knock?
- Sorry.

688
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,875
Can I see him today, Mr Oakley?

689
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:37,790
- When he's had his breakfast you can.
- But he takes ages. He chews everything.

690
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,592
I thought we all did.

691
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:42,757
I just give mine a quick bite
and swallow it.

692
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,791
(William) Mister Tom!

693
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:46,512
Yes?

694
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,551
Is that Zach down there?

695
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,229
Go on, then. You take that up.

696
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,831
Thanks, Mr Oakley.

697
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,829
So what's been happenin'?

698
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,599
Not a lot. Been dead boring, really.

699
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:06,871
Except Mrs Hartridge's husband
got shot down and killed.

700
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,275
Least, they never found him.

701
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:12,392
- But she still had the baby okay.
- Baby?

702
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:15,432
- You did know she was having a baby?
- No.

703
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:19,109
But you must have noticed
how big she'd got!

704
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,435
You do know about sex and stuff,...

705
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,471
..don't you?

706
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:28,036
- Only it's dirty and you go to hell for it.
- That's rubbish, Will.

707
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:32,790
My dad says sex is a man and a woman's
way of showing their love for each other.

708
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:35,274
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for sex.

709
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,914
But can't a lady have a baby on her own?

710
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:43,193
Of course not!
There has to be a man involved.

711
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:51,313
Right, Zach, home time for you, I think.
We don't want William overdoin' it.

712
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:55,148
- But I can come tomorrow, Mr Oakley?
- Course you can.

713
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,476
In that case, I'll see you tomorrow, Will.

714
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:05,318
So, what was all that about, then?

715
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:10,398
Zach says a lady can't have a baby
without a man.

716
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,590
- Oh, yeah?
- Is that right?

717
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,589
Yeah.

718
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,951
Trudy's dead, ain't she?

719
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,036
I think you knew that already.

720
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:23,640
- And I killed her.
- You killed her?

721
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:29,118
- I should've got out. I did try, honest I did!
- Well, of course you did!

722
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:31,720
Only, you were tied up. Right?

723
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:37,232
What you have to remember is that
the way she treated you and the baby...

724
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,919
..was because
your mum was sick, William.

725
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:44,829
In fact, very sick, I'd say,
to do what she did.

726
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,871
The trouble was,...

727
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:52,392
..with this war on, people so busy
survivin' themselves to even notice,...

728
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,158
..there was no-one to help.

729
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,149
Now, you tell me somethin', William.

730
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,873
This nightmare you keep havin'.

731
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,753
It's always the same one, right?

732
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,589
And it's always the same man.

733
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,831
Who is he, this man?

734
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,313
Just this man.

735
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,110
And what does this man do,
in your dream?

736
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:23,869
Just keeps sayin' I have to go with him.

737
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:44,040
Hello! What are you doin' here?

738
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:48,073
- I've come to see Mrs Hartridge.
- She's round the back.

739
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:04,629
Hello, William.

740
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,551
Now,...

741
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,871
..this is my Peggy.

742
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,319
Looks just like her dad, they reckon.

743
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,795
So, how are you feeling now?

744
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,671
I'm all right.

745
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:27,315
Oh, well... At least you're back
safe and sound, eh?

746
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:34,712
So, how about a glass of lemonade, then?

747
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,751
Yeah. Please.

748
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:41,749
Then you just hold on to Peggy for me,
will you, while I get it?

749
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:42,715
That's where my dad's based.
In the East End.

750
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:45,671
He'll be all right.

751
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,591
Course he will.

752
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:36,912
I'm afraid we have bad news for you,
William. It's about your mother.

753
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,396
She don't want me back again, does she?

754
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,311
She's dead, William.

755
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,357
Dead?

756
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,916
She drowned herself, son.

757
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:55,239
Dr Stelton's here from a children's home
in Sussex. Lovely place, I'm told.

758
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:59,319
- Right out in the country.
- I'm sure you'll like it, William.

759
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:02,352
I wanna stay 'ere with Mister Tom!

760
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:05,039
Mister Tom, I wanna stay 'ere with you!

761
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:09,073
Enough of that, my lad.
Mr Oakley is in trouble enough as it is.

762
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:12,795
- A serious offence is kidnappin'.
- I were rescued!

763
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:15,752
Why doesn't William wait upstairs?

764
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,551
Go on, then. Up you go.

765
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,311
William!

766
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,711
The man in your dream.

767
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:47,513
Is that him? The one with the moustache?

768
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,797
Right.

769
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:07,351
This, er... children's home
you're on about takin' him to.

770
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,197
Oh, yes?

771
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:12,471
- You're in charge there, are ya?
- That's right.

772
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:16,115
Only, he's been havin'
these nightmares, you see,...

773
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,116
..ever since I got him back.

774
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:20,230
It's hardly surprising...

775
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:24,319
- About you, apparently.
- Me, Mr Oakley?

776
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:27,318
That you're gonna take him away again.

777
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:31,956
In fact, he wakes up regularly,
screamin' about it.

778
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:37,518
Which bears out what I said: what the lad
needs is specialist medical treatment.

779
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:41,314
What the lad needs is love, Dr Stelton.

780
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:46,309
Somethin' he hadn't seen a lot of,
apparently, before he came to me.

781
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:49,352
Are you people really tryin' to tell me...

782
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:54,918
..that he'll get more of that where you
wanna take him to, than he will here?

783
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,794
If you are,
you're talkin' a right load of rubbish!

784
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:03,152
Mr Oakley, Dr Stelton is one
of the very best in his field.

785
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:10,197
And, along with the rest of us, his one and
only concern is for the boy's own welfare.

786
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,516
Let's get a spot of fresh air,
shall we, Mr Oakley?

787
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,192
(door closes)

788
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:27,155
It isn't the boy's welfare this is about,
really. Is it, Mr Oakley?

789
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:31,398
- Isn't it?
- It's about you, I'd say. Your welfare.

790
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:34,391
Me?

791
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,834
A lonely and, from what I hear,
embittered old man...

792
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,916
..facing a lonely and bitter old age?

793
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:45,112
You really think that's
the only reason I want him back?

794
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,834
To be company for me when I'm past it?

795
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,438
Well, isn't it?

796
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:54,519
No! It bloody well isn't!
And I resent the implication!

797
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:04,711
Doesn't it bother you
that when you're 70...

798
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:06,637
..he'll be in his teens?

799
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:09,114
Course it bothers me! I'm not stupid!

800
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:12,789
There's not a lot
we can do about that, is there?

801
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:17,470
Look, I know it's not an ideal situation.
Anything but.

802
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:20,512
But... well, put it this way...

803
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:25,031
It's gotta be a damn sight more ideal
than your Dr Stelton in there...

804
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:28,595
..turnin' him into
some sort of human guinea pig!

805
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:32,717
Just tell me one thing, Mr Oakley.

806
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:38,471
Why is the boy suddenly so important
to you? He's an evacuee, for God's sake.

807
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:44,390
And one that, as I understand it, you took
violent exception to having foisted on you.

808
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:46,431
Isn't it obvious?

809
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:49,836
Not to me, no. Nor to Dr Stelton.

810
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:52,474
Because I love him, of course.

811
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:56,713
As if he was my own flesh and blood I do.

812
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:00,594
And, for what it's worth,
I think he loves me as well.

813
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:06,272
And is that really enough, do you think,
in this day and age?

814
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:12,156
Well, I suppose it has to be, Mr Greenway.
In this day and age or any other.

815
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:16,432
Because if it isn't... what else is there, eh?

816
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:19,359
(door)

817
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:23,154
I won't go with them, Mister Tom!
I won't go with them!

818
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:26,192
- Oh, won't ya?
- No, I won't!

819
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:28,989
Just as well, then, isn't it?

820
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:31,395
Nobody's askin' you to.

821
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,031
What?

822
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,071
Come 'ere.

823
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:43,879
You see that one in the dark suit?

824
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,592
Yeah.

825
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:48,791
He's from somethin'
called the Home Office.

826
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:52,355
He reckons that,
after all the trouble you've caused,...

827
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,153
..they don't want you back any more,
thanks.

828
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,918
So...

829
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:01,158
..as long as I adopt you,
all legal and proper like,...

830
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,509
..looks like I'm stuck with you.

831
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:05,551
Oh, Mister Tom!

832
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:22,910
Mrs Little, can I see Zach?
I've got some really great news to tell him!

833
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,951
Of course you can, William.

834
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:28,674
He's upstairs... packing.

835
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:33,191
- Packin'?
- Yes. He's just had some news himself.

836
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:35,674
Not very good news, I'm afraid.

837
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:43,948
I got a phone call from my mum.

838
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,833
They bombed the docks.
My dad was there.

839
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:54,628
I'm sure he'll be all right, of course. Take
more than a German bomb to stop him.

840
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:59,388
Only I have to go and see him.

841
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,591
Just in case he's...

842
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:08,751
(bombers overhead)

843
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,394
Are they gonna bomb us, Mister Tom?

844
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,716
They're saving 'em for London, I expect.

845
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:27,635
"This is the BBC Home Service.
Here is the news."

846
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:30,672
"Last night's mass air raid on London...

847
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:34,110
..is estimated to have been
the heaviest so far."

848
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:37,470
"At least 400 people have been killed...

849
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:42,548
..and 1400 seriously injured.
Fires are burning all over the city,...

850
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:47,594
..and many homes in the East End
have been razed to the ground."

851
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,394
Still no word from Zach, then?

852
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,871
'Fraid not.

853
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:25,673
That poor child!

854
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:43,151
(boy) Stop pushing!

855
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:45,191
(woman) Come along.

856
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,956
(train whistle)

857
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:05,711
Oh. William.

858
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,877
William...

859
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:37,356
- Does anybody know where William is?
- (class) No, Mrs Hartridge.

860
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,397
William?

861
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:53,959
(bicycle bell)

862
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,792
Yeah...!

863
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,279
Whoo...!

864
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:07,790
Yeah...! Whoo...!

865
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,956
I hate you, God!

866
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,309
I hate you! I hate you!

867
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,749
I really hate you!

868
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,394
Is William all right, Mr Oakley?

869
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:33,391
Well...

870
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:38,719
He's, er, still very upset, of course, but...

871
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:39,749
Why?

872
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:43,236
Only that he didn't turn up
at school today.

873
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:46,238
Or rather he did, then...

874
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:56,757
(door opens)

875
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,868
Where have you been?

876
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:03,195
Are you all right?

877
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:04,958
Yeah.

878
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,875
Up you go and wash, then.

879
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:13,839
- Tea'll be on the table in five minutes.
- I'm not hungry.

880
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:21,993
(knock at door)

881
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:28,593
- Can we have a word, Doctor?
- Course, Tom. Come in.

882
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,952
Dr Little sent it round.
Thought you might like to learn to ride it.

883
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:57,278
I'm sure Zach would have
wanted you to have it.

884
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:12,792
Now you just come with me for a minute.

885
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,791
Come on!

886
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:26,071
You think you're the only person
who ever lost anybody?

887
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:29,158
It's happenin' to people all over.

888
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,191
This very minute.

889
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:35,438
And all because some maniac
wants to rule the world.

890
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:40,753
And how do you think I felt
when it happened to me?

891
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,792
Not just my wife I lost, you know.

892
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:46,390
She was my best pal as well.

893
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,791
My very best.

894
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:52,549
And my lad.

895
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,108
And me not even here.

896
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,798
Except I didn't lose 'em, you see?

897
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,118
Not really... because they're still here...

898
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,628
..inside here.

899
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:11,796
And always will be.

900
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:15,553
Just like Zach'll be for you.

901
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:19,798
In every little thing
you'll ever remember about him.

902
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:25,676
And that is somethin' that nobody
can ever take away from ya. Nobody.

903
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:27,711
Ever.

904
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:48,158
- (bicycle bell)
- William!

905
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:50,589
William!

906
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:54,519
- What's wrong, Mrs Hartridge?
- Nothing's wrong, William.

907
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:57,472
It's just... Well, I have to tell somebody!

908
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:02,071
I've had this telegram about my David,
and he isn't dead after all!

909
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:04,475
He's alive! A prisoner of war!

910
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:08,957
Isn't that wonderful, William?
Isn't that absolutely wonderful!

911
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,434
Yes, Mrs Hartridge! Really wonderful!

912
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:13,471
(baby crying)

913
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:45,392
Yeah...!

914
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,479
Yeah...!

915
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:48,709
Yeah...!

916
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:51,989
Yeah...!

917
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:54,197
Yeah...!

918
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,231
(bicycle bell)

919
01:39:58,280 --> 01:39:59,793
Whoo!

920
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:05,360
Yeah...!

921
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:08,598
Yeah...!

922
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:10,153
Whoo! Yeah...!

923
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:13,552
I can ride, Dad!

924
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:16,034
I can really ride!

925
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:18,952
Right!

926
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:10,370
