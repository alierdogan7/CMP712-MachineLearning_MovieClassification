1
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,278
<i>[B.J.] Okay, it's your turn.</i>

2
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,075
<i>Tell me a fantasy.</i>

3
00:00:57,148 --> 00:00:58,547
Picture, if you will...

4
00:00:58,616 --> 00:01:00,277
a crisp winter afternoon.

5
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,013
You by a crackling fire
in a smoking jacket.

6
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:05,021
Mmm. What color?

7
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:06,954
Red... with blue satin lapels.

8
00:01:07,024 --> 00:01:10,619
- Mmm.
- And a zipper down the back.

9
00:01:10,694 --> 00:01:13,162
- What for?
- You'll see.

10
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,425
There's a light tapping
at the door.

11
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:19,026
"Who's there?" you say,
checking your zipper.

12
00:01:19,103 --> 00:01:22,038
You saunter to the door,
straightening your ascot...

13
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:24,255
and casually
slide back the bolt.

14
00:01:24,388 --> 00:01:26,481
Come on! Who is it?

15
00:01:26,557 --> 00:01:29,151
- Lana Turner.
- Wearing?

16
00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:33,994
An angora sweater...
with a zipper down the back.

17
00:01:34,065 --> 00:01:36,158
- What for?
- You'll see.

18
00:01:36,234 --> 00:01:38,896
Go on.

19
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,633
She throws her arms around you.
But you push her away!

20
00:01:42,707 --> 00:01:44,698
I push her away? For what?

21
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:48,871
Your smoking jacket
is covered with angora lint.

22
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:51,608
In a fit of pique, she leaves.

23
00:01:51,682 --> 00:01:54,708
That's it? The end?

24
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:57,413
- That's it.
- But what about the zippers down the back?

25
00:01:57,488 --> 00:01:59,979
- They didn't catch on.
- Oh, I don't believe it!

26
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:02,252
I had Lana Turner in a fantasy
with a sweater...

27
00:02:02,326 --> 00:02:04,886
with a zipper down the back
and I let her get away?

28
00:02:04,962 --> 00:02:07,430
- You always were short on zip.
- [Whines]

29
00:02:07,498 --> 00:02:10,126
Then the colonel said,
"Whatever you do, don't tell Burns."

30
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:12,863
- What? What? What?
- Oh, I'm sorry, Frank. I promised.

31
00:02:12,937 --> 00:02:14,871
Why don't
you guys like me, huh?

32
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:17,237
Because you're a lousy doctor
and a rotten person.

33
00:02:17,308 --> 00:02:19,242
- Aside from that.
- Well, there's your pimples.

34
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,804
My pores won't close! Aw, come on, guys.
I'll show you my present.

35
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:26,008
- Show us your present first.
- Okay.

36
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:30,345
[Laughs]
You see?

37
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:34,653
You roll the B.B.'s around
and you try and get 'em in the holes.

38
00:02:34,725 --> 00:02:37,250
Now tell me what the colonel
said not to tell me.

39
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:41,458
[Inhales] He asked Father Mulcahy
to pray for your pores.

40
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:43,466
Smart aleck!

41
00:02:43,534 --> 00:02:45,468
- [B.J.] Can't we play with your game?
- No!

42
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:48,164
Nobody makes fun of my skin
and gets away with it.

43
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,537
Besides, it's from a former receptionist.
[Laughs]

44
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:53,600
Good picture of her.
Nice B.B.'s.

45
00:02:53,678 --> 00:02:56,943
- No dibs on my game.
- Show you my ingrown toenail.

46
00:02:57,014 --> 00:02:59,209
I looked at it
while you were asleep.

47
00:02:59,283 --> 00:03:01,547
Well, then you owe me!

48
00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:05,385
Oh, buzz off!
Aha! Got one B.B. In.

49
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:07,549
- Belly button?
- Uh-uh. Right ear.

50
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,685
- Tilt!
- ## [Whistles]

51
00:03:13,564 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, we managed to kill another
five minutes of the war.

52
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:19,195
Wanna catch a rat
and make it a pet?

53
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,967
Nah. It's not fair to the rat to keep it
in a small furnished apartment.

54
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,009
- You kept a cockroach.
- It was paper-trained.

55
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:29,843
Hey, the <i>Times.</i>
Listen to this.

56
00:03:29,914 --> 00:03:33,714
"Senator Joseph McCarthy claims
Communists have infiltrated the military."

57
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:36,651
I knew it. Every time
they mention those pinkos, I see red.

58
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:38,746
Relax, Comrade.

59
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:41,016
- Aaah! Oh, ho-ho! Bingo!
- What? What? What?

60
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:43,492
- We struck oil and gold!
- What is it?

61
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:46,155
- The <i>Times</i> crossword puzzle.
- Oh, fantastic!

62
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,427
Okay. One down.
Four letters. "Young fellow."

63
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,333
- Uh, "chap."
- Right.

64
00:03:52,403 --> 00:03:55,270
One across.
"Member of the company."

65
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:57,500
- Four letters. Starts with a "C."
- Uh...

66
00:03:57,575 --> 00:03:59,907
- "Cast."
- Good.

67
00:03:59,977 --> 00:04:02,468
It's kid stuff.
Ha-ha!

68
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:05,515
Got a B.B. Right in her eyeball.
[Giggles]

69
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,416
[Mulcahy]
Six-letter word. "Burrowing animal."

70
00:04:08,486 --> 00:04:11,182
- [Hawkeye] "Frank Burns."
- Too many letters.

71
00:04:11,255 --> 00:04:15,521
But close. Let's see.
A burrowing animal. A Hepler!

72
00:04:15,593 --> 00:04:18,619
- A what?
- Louis Hepler. Kid I went to high school with.

73
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:21,062
Got expelled for burrowing
into the girls' washroom.

74
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:25,466
- Only guy I ever knew who got
flushed out of high school.
- I don't think that's it.

75
00:04:25,536 --> 00:04:27,527
- "Ferret"!
- I wonder how he thought of that.

76
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:29,539
[Margaret]
Probably looked in the mirror.

77
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:32,132
- The third letter is a "P."
- How about "gopher"?

78
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:35,645
Bingo!
Uh, I'm sorry.

79
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:37,840
Give us another one.

80
00:04:37,915 --> 00:04:42,682
Six letters, begins with "G,"
and means scandalmonger.

81
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:46,348
- "Gossip."
- Give that lady 14 inches
of perforated intestine.

82
00:04:46,424 --> 00:04:48,483
- What would I do with that?
- Make a clarinet.

83
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:52,017
- [Laughs]
- Margaret, uh, trim that rough edge there.

84
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:54,223
- I don't wanna leave a bad scar.
- Yes, Doctor.

85
00:04:54,298 --> 00:04:58,325
- Why be so careful with
a Chinese prisoner of war?
- Frank, he's a human being.

86
00:04:58,402 --> 00:05:00,870
They line our wounded
up against a wall and hang them!

87
00:05:00,938 --> 00:05:03,873
But, Major Burns,
there is the Christian ethic.

88
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:09,208
I know that! I won a white Bible at my church...
for organ playing. So lay off!

89
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,148
[Potter] Never yell at a priest, Burns.
It's a sure ticket to hell. More suction.

90
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:15,879
It's a waste of time,
saving these slant eyes.

91
00:05:15,953 --> 00:05:18,046
[Potter] They're also collateral.
I'm trying to arrange...

92
00:05:18,122 --> 00:05:20,488
a swap of their prisoners
for our prisoners.

93
00:05:20,558 --> 00:05:22,355
Okay, finished.
Can I help anybody?

94
00:05:22,426 --> 00:05:25,088
- I'm fine. Got this bowel by the tail.
- <i>B.J.?</i>

95
00:05:25,162 --> 00:05:27,096
- Done and done.
- Frank?

96
00:05:27,164 --> 00:05:30,190
So you can take all the credit, I suppose, huh?
[Chuckles]

97
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:34,033
I'm a perfectly competent doctor...
122nd in a class of 200...

98
00:05:34,105 --> 00:05:36,335
and capable
of handling my own cases.

99
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:38,398
Just asking.

100
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:41,570
- We're losing him, Doctor.
- Pierce! Help!

101
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:46,182
[Giggling]

102
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,184
What are you cackling at,
Major Burns?

103
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:51,744
Nothing. Just a game to test your manual
dexterity. It's excellent for surgeons.

104
00:05:51,822 --> 00:05:54,290
How childish!

105
00:05:54,358 --> 00:05:56,292
- That's pornographic.
- What is?

106
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,385
That girl.
She's practically nude.

107
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:00,623
There's nothing wrong
with the human body, Margaret.

108
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:03,132
And there's certainly nothing wrong with hers.
[Laughs]

109
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,603
Oh, you have no idea how silly you look
drooling over that disgusting toy.

110
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:10,265
Well, a man has to have something.
I'm very lonely, Margaret.

111
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:13,333
You deserve to be.
Look at that skimpy outfit she's wearing.

112
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,039
- I could buy you one like it.
- How would you like that
game jammed in your ear?

113
00:06:17,114 --> 00:06:20,208
Oh, don't make me nervous, Margaret.
I'll shake my B.B.'s loose.

114
00:06:20,284 --> 00:06:22,844
It's too late, Frank.

115
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:28,154
All my life I've never been able to finish
a <i>Times</i> crossword puzzle.

116
00:06:28,225 --> 00:06:30,989
- One more word is all we need.
- Shoot.

117
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:32,995
Thirty-eight across.
Five letters.

118
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:34,997
Begins with a "V."
"Means a Yiddish bedbug."

119
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:39,764
Let's see. Yiddish, Jewish, Hebrew...
God knows I've read my Bible.

120
00:06:39,837 --> 00:06:42,465
- Did Moses speak Yiddish?
- Only when he was playing pinochle.

121
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,474
- Oh, Father.
- Yes, Hawk?

122
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:46,874
You know the term
in Yiddish for bedbug?

123
00:06:46,944 --> 00:06:52,814
In the Bible, there are hosts of locusts,
plagues of vermin, and hordes of scorpions.

124
00:06:52,883 --> 00:06:55,784
Boy, a lot of bedbugs
in those days.

125
00:06:55,853 --> 00:06:57,821
Five letters.
Starts with a "V."

126
00:06:57,888 --> 00:07:00,618
Why don't you ask Corporal Shapiro?
He's sitting right over there.

127
00:07:00,691 --> 00:07:03,216
- Oh, thanks, Padre.
- <i>Ma</i>z<i>el tov.</i>

128
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:08,126
- Uh, Shapiro.
- [Southern Accent] Oh, hi, y'all, Doc.

129
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,430
You know the Yiddish word
for bedbug?

130
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:15,666
Sorry, Captain. We been seven generations
in Georgia just raisin' cotton.

131
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:18,207
And old times there are soon forgotten.
<i>Ma</i>z<i>el tov.</i>

132
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:21,301
- How's that, Captain?
- Forget it.

133
00:07:21,378 --> 00:07:23,312
Maybe that's it.

134
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,974
- [With Southern Accent] Bedbug.
- What did Shapiro say?

135
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,075
He can't get the cotton
out of his mouth.

136
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:32,179
Thank you, dear Lord, for giving us
this bounty during trying times. Amen.

137
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:34,383
So that's what this is...
roast bounty.

138
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,688
<i>[Hawkeye]</i>
<i>Does that help?</i>

139
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,694
With a touch of ketchup.

140
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:41,993
- Thank God for ketchup.
- He just did.

141
00:07:42,066 --> 00:07:46,059
I had a friend in college used to make
tomato soup out of ketchup and hot water.

142
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:48,900
That's it!
Tippy Brooks is the answer.

143
00:07:48,973 --> 00:07:51,908
- What's the question?
- The puzzle. He's a crossword freak.

144
00:07:51,976 --> 00:07:53,910
He does
the double crostic in ink.

145
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:56,572
- Oh, your friend the doctor on the <i>Essex.</i>
- Right!

146
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:58,911
- The <i>Essex</i> is in Pusan Harbor.
- <i>[Hawkeye] I know!</i>

147
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:01,975
- Radar, let's get on the horn.
- I haven't checked my bread for maggots.

148
00:08:02,052 --> 00:08:04,680
- Tell 'em you'll be right back.
- Come on.

149
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:11,254
I've got a guy in Seoul contacting the <i>Essex.</i>
He's a radioman first class.

150
00:08:11,328 --> 00:08:14,354
- <i>[Hawkeye] That's nice for his mother.</i>
- I only know him by voice.

151
00:08:14,431 --> 00:08:18,060
Stevens? Yeah, yeah!
I can hardly hear ya.

152
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:21,229
Oh, oh, oh, oh. His oatmeal cookie
caught fire in the ashtray.

153
00:08:21,305 --> 00:08:23,671
- Gracious living.
- <i>Did you put it out?</i>

154
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:26,642
Oh, he lost his cookie,
but he saved his raisins.

155
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,678
How come we don't
get raisins?

156
00:08:28,746 --> 00:08:30,873
I saw some the other day,
but they flew away.

157
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:34,281
That's right. Lieutenant Brooks.
He's a doctor on the <i>Essex.</i>

158
00:08:34,351 --> 00:08:38,720
Uh-huh? Stevens?
Stevens, I can hardly hear y...

159
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,848
Oh, boy! He's fading.
Hawkeye...

160
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:44,223
put your right hand on the wastebasket
and hold your left hand out.

161
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:46,729
- Will this blow out the lightbulb in my navel?
- Uh-uh.

162
00:08:46,797 --> 00:08:50,597
B.J., you hold his hand and hold
your left hand straight up.

163
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:53,102
- You've got sweaty palms.
- I'm new in radio.

164
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,106
Stevens? Right.
Okay, hold on.

165
00:08:57,174 --> 00:08:59,165
Uh, Doctor Brooks
is in surgery.

166
00:08:59,243 --> 00:09:01,905
Tell him Hawkeye Pierce,
MASH 4077, called.

167
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:03,913
- And needs his help desperately.
- Right.

168
00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:09,317
Uh, Dr. Hawkeye Pierce, MASH 4077,
needs his help real bad. Right.

169
00:09:09,386 --> 00:09:11,479
- Thanks, kid.
- What? What?

170
00:09:11,555 --> 00:09:14,183
I can't hear ya.
My aerials walked out on me.

171
00:09:14,358 --> 00:09:16,292
[Straining]

172
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,521
Ah! Whew.

173
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:25,465
<i>[Metal Clanking]</i>

174
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:34,373
<i>[Metal Clanking]</i>

175
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,775
[Clanks]

176
00:09:42,286 --> 00:09:44,254
Hi, Klinger.
How's it goin'?

177
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:47,085
- I'm eating a jeep.
- Good.

178
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:50,952
[Gulps]

179
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:52,962
[Regurgitates]

180
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,555
[Gulps]

181
00:10:02,773 --> 00:10:05,037
- Colonel?
- Radar, no interoffice running.

182
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:08,408
- Yes, sir.
- Good news. The Chinese have
agreed to a prisoner exchange.

183
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:10,413
Terrific.
Sir, we got big problems.

184
00:10:10,481 --> 00:10:12,472
Hawkeye locked Burns
in the nurses' latrine?

185
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:14,608
- No, sir. That was last Friday.
- Time flies.

186
00:10:14,685 --> 00:10:16,653
- Yes. It's Klinger.
- Rats in his blue wig?

187
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,349
- No, sir. He's outside having a picnic.
- Annoying but tolerable.

188
00:10:20,424 --> 00:10:22,415
He's eating a jeep.

189
00:10:23,494 --> 00:10:25,462
- I beg your pardon?
- He's eating a jeep.

190
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:28,396
- Which one?
- The one with the squeaky seats.

191
00:10:28,465 --> 00:10:31,491
[Exhales]
Finally came up with something fresh.

192
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:33,661
How do you see through
those filthy glasses?

193
00:10:33,737 --> 00:10:35,621
I know where everything is.

194
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:41,951
<i>There he is, sir.</i>

195
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:46,428
"A" for effort, Klinger.
But it won't work.

196
00:10:46,498 --> 00:10:48,693
Watch this.

197
00:10:50,236 --> 00:10:52,261
[Gulping]

198
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:56,374
Oh, wow! Right down.

199
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:59,240
Dip it in a little 30-weight motor oil,
pop it in...

200
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:02,542
and let it slide down the gullet
like a bluepoint oyster.

201
00:11:02,615 --> 00:11:04,583
Colonel, he's crazy!

202
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:08,518
See! I got a witness! You gotta give me
a Section Eight and send me home.

203
00:11:08,587 --> 00:11:11,988
- No dice.
- If you don't throw me out for being a nut...

204
00:11:12,057 --> 00:11:13,888
<i>you're nuttier</i>
<i>than I am!</i>

205
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,519
- Sir.
- Sir, he just ate a piece of iron.

206
00:11:16,595 --> 00:11:19,894
- That, too, shall pass.
- Okay.

207
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:21,899
The second course.

208
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:33,411
How about that?

209
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:35,811
That dumb wiper
never worked anyway.

210
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:38,714
Cute idea, Klinger.
Now cancel the picnic.

211
00:11:38,784 --> 00:11:42,379
You don't believe I'm gonna
eat this jeep, do you, sir?

212
00:11:42,454 --> 00:11:44,786
Let's say I find it
hard to swallow.

213
00:11:44,857 --> 00:11:47,087
Stick around, Colonel,
and watch it disappear.

214
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:50,128
If you want to ruin your stomach,
eat in the Mess Tent.

215
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:54,063
I need this jeep
for the prisoner exchange.

216
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:58,365
Just once I'd like to sit down to a meal
and not be interrupted by business.

217
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,677
- Gee, you think he's gonna be all right?
- Oh, he'll be fine.

218
00:12:05,744 --> 00:12:08,577
We may have to slap him on the rack
and give him a lube job.

219
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:11,810
- But he was eating nuts.
- Squirrels do it all the time.

220
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:14,148
Won't that hurt him,
all that oil and metal?

221
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:18,178
He may slide out of bed tonight
and end up pointing at the North Pole.

222
00:12:18,257 --> 00:12:20,623
- You mean like a magnet?
- If he gets real bad...

223
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:24,151
we'll stick him to the side of a boxcar
and send him down to Seoul.

224
00:12:24,229 --> 00:12:28,393
Oh, you better tell the boys playing horseshoes
to hold up when Klinger walks by.

225
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:31,732
Soldier, your repairs are over.
We're trading you in on a domestic model.

226
00:12:31,804 --> 00:12:34,830
- Should we turn back his speedometer?
- Against the Geneva Convention.

227
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:36,875
- You...
- Uh-huh.

228
00:12:36,942 --> 00:12:39,433
- Head.
- Little tight around the crotch?

229
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:42,947
Soo Ling say, "Thank you."

230
00:12:43,015 --> 00:12:46,212
- Captain Hawkeye Pierce
say, "You're welcome."
- <i>[Klinger Moaning]</i>

231
00:12:47,252 --> 00:12:49,482
- Klinger, what is it?
- Something I ate.

232
00:12:49,555 --> 00:12:52,490
I told you the food here
should not be taken internally.

233
00:12:52,558 --> 00:12:54,526
I had a couple of bolts,
a horn button...

234
00:12:54,593 --> 00:12:56,561
part of a windshield wiper
and a condenser.

235
00:12:56,628 --> 00:12:59,096
- Well-balanced meal.
- But crazy.

236
00:12:59,164 --> 00:13:01,257
- Not crazy enough. [Moans]
- I get it.

237
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,666
Baker! X-ray the Lebanese for hardware.
He's in for a tune-up.

238
00:13:04,737 --> 00:13:07,365
<i>[Hawkeye]</i>
<i>And try not to rattle when you walk.</i>

239
00:13:08,874 --> 00:13:10,865
Sir, this message
just come in for you.

240
00:13:10,943 --> 00:13:13,275
It's from your friend Lieutenant Brooks.
He's on his way.

241
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:16,007
- On his way?
- Yeah. He's coming here.

242
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:19,016
- He heard about the emergency.
He's bringing an admiral.
- An admiral?

243
00:13:19,084 --> 00:13:21,848
- Radar, there's no emergency.
- There isn't?

244
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,115
- No.
- No. We were working on a crossword puzzle.

245
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:27,352
- We needed a word. Don't you remember?
- Ooh, that's right.

246
00:13:27,426 --> 00:13:31,226
But, hey, Lieutenant Brooks is coming here,
and so's the admiral.

247
00:13:31,296 --> 00:13:33,560
Boy, you guys
are in a lot of trouble.

248
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:37,836
Nice.

249
00:13:52,017 --> 00:13:54,542
- Sirs?
- Where can I find Dr. Pierce, Corporal?

250
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,680
Uh, that tent right over there, sir...
smells like dirty socks.

251
00:13:57,756 --> 00:14:00,691
That jeep was a kidney buster.
Soldier, the head?

252
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:02,693
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

253
00:14:02,761 --> 00:14:06,219
- Latrine.
- Oh, it's right over there.

254
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:08,994
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

255
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:11,160
Third hole pinches!

256
00:14:11,236 --> 00:14:13,796
- Medicine's come a long way, Beej.
- Mmm.

257
00:14:13,872 --> 00:14:16,238
There was a time when
proctologists used candles.

258
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:18,538
O-O-Oh, that smarts!

259
00:14:19,745 --> 00:14:22,111
- Tippy!
- Hawk.

260
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:26,015
What a hell of a trip we had.
We left the carrier this morning.

261
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:28,518
The chopper was forced
down at, uh, Taejon.

262
00:14:28,587 --> 00:14:31,886
Then we got a cattle train to Ansong.
Tracks were shelled.

263
00:14:31,957 --> 00:14:35,825
Then we had to walk for 10 miles
till a jeep picked us up. But we made it.

264
00:14:35,894 --> 00:14:38,226
Well, what's
the emergency?

265
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:40,629
Tippy, this is B.J. Hunnicutt.
Uh, B.J., Tippy Brooks.

266
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:41,723
- Hi.
- How ya doin'?

267
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,892
- We made it.
- Terrific.

268
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:46,062
- What's the emergency, huh?
- Uh, you tell him.

269
00:14:46,138 --> 00:14:49,232
[Chuckles]
He's your friend.

270
00:14:51,143 --> 00:14:54,909
Tippy, I really didn't think you'd come
all the way out here.

271
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,915
L-I just needed a five-letter
Yiddish word for bedbug.

272
00:15:01,286 --> 00:15:03,777
- What?
- I'm sorry.

273
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:08,020
You're sorry?
What am I gonna tell Admiral Cox?

274
00:15:08,093 --> 00:15:11,153
Oh, he'll hang me
from the highest, uh...

275
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:13,994
Um, whatchamacallit...
Uh, seven letters. Starts with "Y."

276
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:16,432
- "Yardarm."
- Th-Thanks.

277
00:15:16,502 --> 00:15:20,438
Yeah. Look, sit down.
I know you're in a big jam, but first things first.

278
00:15:20,506 --> 00:15:22,440
Do you know
the word? Bedbug?

279
00:15:22,508 --> 00:15:24,442
- Bedbug.
- Five letters.

280
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,444
- Five letters.
- [B.J.] Yiddish.

281
00:15:26,512 --> 00:15:28,446
Yiddish.

282
00:15:28,514 --> 00:15:31,074
- Hawkeye, will you stop?
- I thought as long as you were here.

283
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:33,310
Look, we really
figured you'd <i>call</i> back.

284
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:35,353
You guys have really
got me up the creek!

285
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,547
The admiral thinks we're here
for a medical emergency.

286
00:15:37,623 --> 00:15:39,648
- What'll I tell him?
- I could hold my breath.

287
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:42,455
- We could say it's a case of blue face.
- You'd die.

288
00:15:42,528 --> 00:15:45,588
Right now, a far, far better thing
than me being busted to J.G.

289
00:15:45,664 --> 00:15:48,963
J.G.? They'll bust you
to John Garfield?

290
00:15:51,103 --> 00:15:55,267
You sure surprised me when you
walked in there, Admiral.
Caught me with my guard down.

291
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,070
The call of nature beckons to everybody.
Both army and navy.

292
00:15:58,143 --> 00:16:00,441
- And the marines.
- I'm not too sure about them.

293
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:02,173
- Coffee?
- Oh, fine.

294
00:16:02,247 --> 00:16:04,772
- Cox. Cox. Is that with an "X"?
- Yes.

295
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,546
That story you told me about gettin' here
is a real rouser.

296
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:09,553
It's a wonder you weren't killed.

297
00:16:09,621 --> 00:16:13,148
Not that I'm not glad to see ya,
but I can't help wondering why you're here.

298
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:16,524
I was visiting the <i>Essex</i>
when your emergency call came in.
I've always believed that...

299
00:16:16,595 --> 00:16:19,792
- one branch has to come
to the aid of the other.
- Uh, right.

300
00:16:19,865 --> 00:16:22,834
Now, Admiral, just go in the Mess Tent here.
Order anything you want.

301
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:27,201
- I wanna check on this emergency.
- Good. I haven't had a bite
since I left the carrier.

302
00:16:27,272 --> 00:16:30,207
- Specialty tonight was Egyptian sauerkraut.
- Egyptian?

303
00:16:30,275 --> 00:16:32,709
- Part of their U.N. Contribution.
- Oh, I see.

304
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:34,973
We sent back the camels.

305
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:40,508
- It's all a misunderstanding.
- Getting an admiral here
for a crossword puzzle?

306
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:42,747
- You guys are one for the book.
- I'm sorry.

307
00:16:42,821 --> 00:16:44,880
- He's sorry.
- You were sorry when...

308
00:16:44,957 --> 00:16:47,152
you gave Major Burns
a chocolate-coated lizard.

309
00:16:47,225 --> 00:16:50,752
- It was Easter.
- Now you've put your buddy's butt in a sling?

310
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:52,763
What are we gonna
tell the admiral?

311
00:16:52,831 --> 00:16:56,597
We gotta think of something
legitimate. He's no dummy.
He can see through a bulkhead.

312
00:16:56,668 --> 00:16:59,228
Maybe we could run him through post-op,
see what turns up there.

313
00:16:59,304 --> 00:17:03,331
Okay. He's bound to find problems
he's never seen on a nice, clean ship.

314
00:17:03,408 --> 00:17:06,104
Filth, do your stuff.

315
00:17:06,178 --> 00:17:09,147
- Hey, don't worry about it.
- We're in trouble all the time.

316
00:17:14,353 --> 00:17:16,583
- Say good-bye, Dr. Pierce.
- So long, Soo Ling.

317
00:17:16,655 --> 00:17:18,782
- Prisoner exchange.
- Thirty of theirs for 40 of ours.

318
00:17:18,857 --> 00:17:21,690
- It's a sale.
- Did you bring us here just to show us that?

319
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,728
- Uh, no, no, Admiral.
- Of course not.

320
00:17:23,795 --> 00:17:26,696
Here's a difficult case.
Uh, Pierce?

321
00:17:26,765 --> 00:17:30,292
Thank you, Colonel. Following routine
extraction of shrapnel from the leg...

322
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:32,997
this patient displayed
unusual dehydration.

323
00:17:33,071 --> 00:17:35,562
An insatiable need
for liquids.

324
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:38,269
- Like a drink, soldier?
- No, thank you. I'm not thirsty.

325
00:17:40,412 --> 00:17:42,642
- I can't thank you enough, Admiral.
- It's a miracle.

326
00:17:42,714 --> 00:17:45,274
- Can we get on with this?
- Yeah, let's get on with this.

327
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,684
- Okay, let's get on with this.
- Admiral, this is Corporal Klinger.

328
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:55,553
- What is it, soldier?
- [Mutters]

329
00:17:55,627 --> 00:17:57,561
Huh?

330
00:17:57,629 --> 00:18:00,757
- Klinger!
- Sorry. I usually don't kiss on the first date.

331
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:04,097
- What kind of a place are you running here?
- This case is very unusual.

332
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:07,138
- This case has a screw loose.
- Close. Baker, get us Klinger's X ray.

333
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:10,038
Admiral, if you can't send me home,
can I transfer to the navy?

334
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:13,407
Look at that sonar.
He could smell a sub at 30 fathoms.

335
00:18:16,014 --> 00:18:18,710
Nuts, bolts, knobs?
This guy's full of machinery.

336
00:18:18,784 --> 00:18:22,413
- He was trying to eat a jeep.
- Eat a jeep? He shouldn't
even be in the service!

337
00:18:22,487 --> 00:18:25,513
- I love you!
- Aah!

338
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,184
Only take me a minute
to pack my makeup kit and rollers.

339

Stop it! You've got
no emergency here, Potter.

Now I am gonna see there's an investigation!

Come on, Brooks.
Let's get out of this loony bin.

- What a mess!

- Right.

- You a corpsman?
- The best in the business, dad.

the gasoline with rags.

360
00:19:29,621 --> 00:19:31,316
- To use in their lamps.
- Wonderful.

You know what happened? When it got dark
they couldn't see what they were doing.

362
00:19:34,626 --> 00:19:36,890
- Some guy lit a match.
- And a few of his friends.

00:19:36,962 --> 00:19:38,896
More plasma.

00:19:38,964 --> 00:19:40,795

Smoke inhalation.

- Pierce?
- Yes, Admiral?

I've debrided the burn and applied
the dressing. Anything more I can do?

00:20:30,282 --> 00:20:32,546
Not a thing. Unless you want
to sign up for a year.

You know, that really roasts
my butt. Why don't we put out
some propaganda of our own?

- <i>[Brooks] Like what, Admiral?</i>
- Like those burn victims.

- Why should we say that?
- Because it's a very effective weapon, Pierce.

403
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,768
Every time they put out something,
we should put out something worse.
