00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:06,706
<i>Hanks: March, 1944...</i>

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,575
<i>After four months of fierce
jungle combat,</i>

3
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,015
<i>The marines of the 1st division</i>

4
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:13,518
<i>Were withdrawn from
cape gloucester.</i>

5
00:00:15,956 --> 00:00:18,324
<i>Veteran #1: We were absolutely certain
we were going to go back</i>

6
00:00:18,358 --> 00:00:21,460
<i>To Melbourne to rest again.</i>

7
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:25,330
But no, we ended up on
an island called pavuvu.

8
00:00:26,832 --> 00:00:30,234
<i>Hanks: Pavuvu, part of the
Solomon island chain,</i>

9
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:32,435
<i>Is just north of guadalcanal.</i>

10
00:00:34,638 --> 00:00:37,206
<i>Once a thriving coconut
plantation,</i>

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,508
<i>It was abandoned when the
war broke out.</i>

12
00:00:41,478 --> 00:00:44,680
The guy that picked that out,
he sure didn't know what he was doing.

13
00:00:44,714 --> 00:00:48,219
It was the nastiest,
dirtiest looking place under the sun.

14
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:51,623
All kinds of things
just grew in profusion,

15
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:54,227
Especially the rat population.

16
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:56,531
The land crabs would
come out at night

17
00:00:56,565 --> 00:01:00,034
And you could hear them
clackity-clacking and clicking around.

18
00:01:00,068 --> 00:01:02,104
And they would get
into your shoes.

19
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,375
<i>Veteran #5: A lot of
training started.</i>

20
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:08,777
<i>And it seemed to get
heavier and heavier,</i>

21
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:11,913
<i>So you knew we were gonna go
somewhere into combat.</i>

22
00:01:13,715 --> 00:01:15,883
<i>Hanks: In late August, 1944,</i>

23
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:18,285
<i>The 1st division shipped
out again</i>

24
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,357
<i>Headed for a small coral island beten
Guam and the Philippines...</i>

25
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:24,760
<i>Peleliu.</i>

26
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:27,730
<i>Only six miles long and
two miles wide,</i>

27
00:01:27,764 --> 00:01:29,632
<i>Peleliu held an airstrip</i>

28
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,902
<i>That was close to the
philippine islands.</i>

29
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:34,638
<i>General Douglas macarthur decided</i>

30
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:36,239
<i>That the capture of that airstrip</i>

31
00:01:36,274 --> 00:01:38,909
<i>Was critical to retaking
the Philippines</i>

32
00:01:38,943 --> 00:01:41,079
<i>As a stepping stone
to the invasion</i>

33
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:43,115
<i>Of the Japanese mainland.</i>

34
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:45,384
( explosions )

35
00:01:45,418 --> 00:01:49,222
<i>The Navy bombarded peleliu
for three days</i>

36
00:01:49,257 --> 00:01:52,125
<i>And the marines followed.</i>

37
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,470
<i>The men were told that the fighting
would last only a few days.</i>

38
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:03,873
<i>But the combat on peleliu</i>

39
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:06,676
<i>Would last more than two months</i>

40
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,679
<i>And would become as deadly</i>

41
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:12,216
<i>As any island invasion
of world war ii.</i>

42
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:17,054
<i>Veteran #4: I don't think you could
train for anything like that.</i>

43
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:20,291
<i>It started when we started in.</i>

44
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:24,629
And it didn't cease.

45
00:02:24,663 --> 00:02:28,599
It was... it was a nightmare.

46
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:43,048
<i>Puller: For you are about to be
awarded the medal of honor.</i>

47
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:47,453
Selling U.S. War bonds
is just as important

48
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:51,758
As what you did on guadalcanal.
Now pack your seabag. You're going home.

49
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:53,126
Home?

50
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:55,028
I'm enlisting tomorrow.

51
00:02:55,063 --> 00:02:57,698
I'd do it tonight
if they were open.

52
00:02:57,733 --> 00:03:00,635
Eugene... - I don't need
your permission, father.

53
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:03,972
<i>"dear vera, we haven't seen a
jap for two weeks now.</i>

54
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:07,476
<i>They got smart and got the hell out
of this godforsaken spot.</i>

55
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:09,879
<i>Now our enemy is the
jungle itself.</i>

56
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:12,849
<i>The jungle and the rain."</i>

57
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:15,886
<i>Lebec!</i>

58
00:03:18,723 --> 00:03:21,826
All you need is a week or two.
That should do the trick.

59
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,695
<i>They got a hospital
over on banika.</i>

60
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:27,065
<i>I'm gonna pull some paper and you'll
be on your way in an hour.</i>

61
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:30,068
Why am I in with guys who need to
have their razor blades taken away?

62
00:03:30,103 --> 00:03:32,438
Most of the guys that come
through here are simply...

63
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:33,806
Tired.

64
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,108
My guess is you fall
into that category.

65
00:03:36,143 --> 00:03:38,110
Hey, you're a dead man,
you know it!

66
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:41,481
- ( grunts )
- go get Dr. Grant!

67
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:44,416
This isn't the right place for me.
I'm rested, I'm fit.

68
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:47,519
I want to return to my
unit and my friends.

69
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:50,189
I hope it's quick and
easy for you, leckie.

70
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:52,324
No worries about
ending up like me.

75

Membership in the

00:12:44,454 --> 00:12:46,723
You mortars too?

174
00:12:46,757 --> 00:12:49,825
Riflemen, third platoon.
Bill leyden.

175
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,262
- Then we'll ignore you.
- ( snickering )

176
00:12:53,296 --> 00:12:56,499
- That's snafu.
- ( grunts )

177
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:59,535
<i>That man's de l'eau and I'm
corporal burgin.</i>

178
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,905
Find yourself a bunk.

179
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,013
Taken.

180
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,719
Taken.

181
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:22,658
Come on, I'll show you around,

182
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:24,927
Find you another tent.

183
00:13:35,838 --> 00:13:37,906
Let's go.

184
00:13:40,276 --> 00:13:43,379
This is where they dry-dock us
when we're not killing japs.

185
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:46,449
<i>- Over there is chow...
- Man: Move it!</i>

186
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:49,085
...Heads,

187
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,022
King company skipper,
Captain haldane.

188
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:53,824
<i>Everybody calls him ack ack.</i>

189
00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:56,661
<i>- What's your name?
- De l'eau.</i>

190
00:13:56,695 --> 00:13:58,896
D-e...

191
00:13:58,931 --> 00:14:03,367
L'e-a-u, de l'eau.

192
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:05,035
Jay de l'eau.

193
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,138
Were you in guadalcanal?

194
00:14:07,172 --> 00:14:11,208
Gloucester. G-l...

195
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:13,744
Grab a rack in that
second tent over there.

196
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:15,713
Thanks.

197
00:14:15,747 --> 00:14:17,748
<i>Sure thing.</i>

198
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:24,222
Oh, you know where I
could find how company?

199
00:14:24,256 --> 00:14:26,091
1st marines?

200
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,661
Somewhere over there.

201
00:14:33,901 --> 00:14:35,869
- Wanna get some chow?
- Been waiting for it.

202
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:44,044
<i>- Ho ho ho.
- Runner: We know this guy?</i>

203
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:46,046
Mug's ugly enough
to ring a few bells.

204
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:47,715
Gloucester,
maybe? Was it gloucester?

205
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:49,483
<i>- Chuckler: Was it gloucester?
- Was he on gloucester?</i>

206
00:14:49,518 --> 00:14:51,385
- He may have been on gloucester.
- He looks familiar.

207
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:52,886
Maybe he was on gloucester.

208
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,588
<i>- I don't know. He's ugly.
- Fuck you all.</i>

209
00:14:54,622 --> 00:14:56,657
Looks like a land crab that
once crawled up my pee hole.

210
00:14:56,691 --> 00:14:58,191
( laughs )

211
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:01,961
Hey, welcome home, cobber.

212
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:08,168
You have a good vacation?

213
00:15:08,202 --> 00:15:11,338
Anything to get away
from you bastards.

214
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:12,907
We're not so lucky.

215
00:15:12,941 --> 00:15:14,575
Oh, jeez!

216
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,311
- Ho, there you go.
- ( laughs )

217
00:15:17,346 --> 00:15:18,980
What's in this?

218
00:15:19,014 --> 00:15:22,049
When it tastes this bad,
it's hard to tell.

219
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:24,918
What you got?

220
00:15:24,953 --> 00:15:27,388
Pens. Tell Santa whether
you been naughty or nice.

221
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:29,290
Naughty. The naughtiest.

222
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:32,160
- It's June.
- It's the South pacific.

223
00:15:32,194 --> 00:15:34,696
Christmas comes in June.

224
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:36,732
For hoosier...

225
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:39,101
<i>'cause he's always saying his prayers,
making his bed.</i>

226
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:40,436
- Aw!
- All: Awww!

227
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,404
- Look at that.
- That's beautiful.

228
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:44,206
<i>- Chuckler?
- Yes?</i>

229
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,675
<i>- Thank you.
- Heavier reading.</i>

230
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,577
- With pictures.
- Here you go.

231
00:15:48,611 --> 00:15:50,246
<i>Something for runner's stocking.</i>

232
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,214
Oh, I read this already.

233
00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:10,799
I don't believe it.

234
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:18,074
Oh!

235
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:20,076
Something's wrong.

236
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:22,679
Something's very wrong if you
made it through boot camp.

237
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:24,314
Give me a break, you old greaser!

238
00:16:24,348 --> 00:16:27,217
Haldane: Get up off my deck.

239
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:29,152
- Captain haldane.
- Sir.

240
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:32,455
What's this about, marine?
Some rite of greeting new to the corps?

241
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:35,024
Yes, sir. Um, I mean, no, sir.

242
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:38,127
- Who are you?
- Private Eugene sledge, sir.

243
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:41,397
<i>You fellas know each other or is this
some kind of conflict resolution?</i>

244
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:43,867
Old friends, sir.
Mobile, Alabama, sir.

245
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:46,269
- Mobile?
- Yes, sir.

246
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:49,973
- Old friends, huh?
- That explains it.

247
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,709
As you were.

248
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:54,545
But try not to dislocate a
shoulder or break an arm.

249
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,014
We need both you men healthy.

250
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,215
- Sir.
- Sir.

251
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,816
Carry on.

252
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,929
Get me in hot water
on the first day.

253
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,365
Yeah, well, you deserve it!

254
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,436
Welcome to paradise.

255
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,138
( chattering )

256
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:21,440
<i>Sledge: How do you get used to
the smell around here?</i>

257
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:23,209
Think this shitheap stinks now,

258
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,378
You should have seen it
when we first got here.

259
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:28,949
It was wall-to-wall rats,
crabs and rotten coconuts.

260
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:31,585
Thank God I'm rotating home.

261
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:34,455
I can't believe I finally
get here and you go home.

262
00:17:34,489 --> 00:17:36,190
When you leavin'?

263
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:38,226
When the marine corps tells me.

264
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,828
- What's your unit?
- K-3-5.

265
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:43,930
<i>- A mortarman, just like you.
- ( rain pattering )</i>

266
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:45,899
Whoo-hoo!

267
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:51,170
Hallelujah.

268
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:53,705
The health of the corps

269
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,974
Is only as strong

270
00:17:56,009 --> 00:18:00,245
As the health of the
individual marine.

271
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,151
Marines will make every effort
to keep themselves clean.

272
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,020
- Hey!
- Ahh!

273
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:09,322
Hey, don't you quit on me, fucker!

274
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:11,658
- You gotta be kidding!
- Not till I've rinsed.

275
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:14,095
<i>Phillips: They get hot chow
to you when they can.</i>

276
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:16,531
You know, it might
only be crud like this,

277
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:19,168
But when you been on
the line taking fire,

278
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:21,470
Hot chow is a miracle.

279
00:18:22,973 --> 00:18:26,508
- Oh, for heaven's sake.
- What is that, baby food?

280
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:29,178
( men laughing )

281
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:31,447
You know, you laugh... you laugh,

282
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:33,616
But that might be worth its
weight in gold someday.

283
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,485
You get hungry enough,
somebody'll want to trade for it.

284
00:18:38,188 --> 00:18:41,992
You do not trade this... Ever.

285
00:18:42,026 --> 00:18:43,626
( cocking )

286
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:46,496
.45 will stop a jap better
than a clip of your carbine.

287
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,132
You hit one of the suckers
in the hand with that,

288
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:51,268
Heh, take his arm right off.

289
00:18:51,302 --> 00:18:54,138
You can write your father a
nice thank-you note for that.

290
00:18:54,172 --> 00:18:57,775
Working party... three of
you boots go with snafu.

291
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:58,943
Hurry up!

292
00:18:58,978 --> 00:19:02,514
You heard the sergeant... Now!

293
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:05,083
You don't mind, do you, leyden?

294
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:08,754
You assholes are gonna miss cleaning
out oil barrels pretty soon.

295
00:19:10,189 --> 00:19:12,925
You're gonna be humping
up some fucking hill...

296
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:17,363
Or across a beach,

297
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:19,799
Japs pouring shit for fire,

298
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,835
Pissing your pants,
crying "boo hoo,"

299
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,638
And wishing you were back
here with nothing asked of you

300
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:27,573
But to scrub oil out of drums.

301
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:29,974
( panting )

302
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:32,343
Why don't you grab a brush

303
00:19:32,378 --> 00:19:33,744
And give us a hand?

304
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:36,714
Fuck that shit.
I scrub drums for no man.

305
00:19:36,748 --> 00:19:38,649
Can we take a break?

306
00:19:38,684 --> 00:19:41,552
Do whatever you want.
This ain't my detail.

307
00:19:41,587 --> 00:19:46,057
I was supposed to dump you all off here,
then report back to the c.P.

308
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:48,093
Then why are you still here?

309
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:52,230
I like to watch the
new guys sweat.

310
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:12,684
Ahh! Are those the
most butt-ugly creatures

311
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:15,787
You ever saw before in your life?

312
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:22,661
( strikes lighter )

313
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:24,863
Jesus, sid.

314
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:29,869
When you start pulling them out
of your hooch in the morning,

315
00:20:29,903 --> 00:20:32,606
You won't feel so tenderhearted.

316
00:20:55,528 --> 00:20:58,530
Lost mine in the polk.

317
00:20:58,564 --> 00:21:01,866
Or somebody took it. Maybe one of
the swabbies wanted a souvenir.

318
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,301
Yeah?

319
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:06,371
Some of the guys think
they're good luck.

320
00:21:06,405 --> 00:21:09,574
I don't know.
You can have this one.

321
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:12,210
I got a couple.

322
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,646
Here.

323
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:18,049
- Thank you.
- Sure.

324
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:25,657
( sighs )

325
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:28,026
Sid?

326
00:21:29,729 --> 00:21:31,497
What's it like?

327
00:21:39,107 --> 00:21:41,508
I slept with a woman in Melbourne.

328
00:21:41,543 --> 00:21:43,344
I'm not bragging.

329
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,783
But that's at one end, right?

330
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:53,055
And then way down there
as far as you can go...

331
00:21:55,158 --> 00:21:58,995
And that's what it's like.

332
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:01,597
And that...

333
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:04,166
That you could never imagine.

334
00:22:09,771 --> 00:22:11,539
Okay.

335
00:22:16,444 --> 00:22:19,045
I'm gonna miss you, sid.

336
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:29,221
You'll be all right.

337
00:22:54,115 --> 00:22:56,916
<i>Woman in movie: Are you
angry about mething?</i>

338
00:22:56,984 --> 00:22:59,986
<i>Man in movie: Of course no</i>

339
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,422
<i>Woman: I'm glad.</i>

340
00:23:02,456 --> 00:23:04,690
I won't cry.

341
00:23:07,394 --> 00:23:09,829
Dear Christ in heaven,
would you look at her?

342
00:23:09,863 --> 00:23:13,999
<i>I don't know how to kiss
or I would kiss you.</i>

343
00:23:16,537 --> 00:23:18,805
Where do the noses go?

344
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:27,214
<i>- ( men whistling )
- man: There we go!</i>

345
00:23:27,248 --> 00:23:30,083
What are you waiting for?
Fuck her.

346
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,419

357

You seen Phillips?

361
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:03,446
I believe the angels
are shipping out.

362
00:25:03,481 --> 00:25:06,750
You might catch them
back down at the docks.

363

366
00:25:38,483 --> 00:25:41,619
Kipling. Always good.

367
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:44,689
Most of these jokers can't read.

<i>Have you heard the latest

369
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,827
There's another war?

370
00:25:49,862 --> 00:25:53,164
We invaded Europe.
Landed last month in France.

371
00:25:53,198 --> 00:25:56,233
Hell, unless you got a brother over there,
most guys don't give a shit.

372
00:25:56,268 --> 00:25:58,769
My brother landed in Italy,

373
00:25:58,803 --> 00:26:01,906
<i>Tank battalion.</i>

374
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,208
Well, I guess you
get to give a shit.

375

376
00:26:08,213 --> 00:26:10,581

378
00:26:26,198 --> 00:26:29,634
That explains it.
You're a believer.

379
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:31,937
Yes.

380
00:26:34,073 --> 00:26:36,175
Okay, question:

381
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:37,943
God created everything, right?

382
00:26:37,977 --> 00:26:42,013
The heavens, the seven seas,
the marine corps...

383
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:43,847
<i>Sleeping beauty there...</i>

384
00:26:43,882 --> 00:26:45,415
Even him.

385
00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:48,216
...Land crabs, rats, mosquitoes.

386
00:26:48,251 --> 00:26:50,318
The mosquitoes are a little tough
to understand, I guess, but...

387
00:26:50,352 --> 00:26:53,287
God created japs too, right...

388
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:57,256
Yellow slants who have tried
to kill me on many occasions?

389
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,791
Japs come from the
garden of eden too?

390
00:27:01,894 --> 00:27:03,862
Well, what we do is up to us.

391
00:27:03,896 --> 00:27:06,865
<i>He gives the choice.</i>

392
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:10,101
Free will. Right.

393
00:27:10,135 --> 00:27:14,238
Except he's God, of course, so he knows
what we're gonna do before we do it.

394
00:27:14,272 --> 00:27:16,674
Predestination.

395
00:27:19,277 --> 00:27:22,078
So the whole game is fixed by
the will of gramps on his throne

396
00:27:22,113 --> 00:27:23,880
While we're down here for what?

397
00:27:23,914 --> 00:27:27,316
His entertainment? That makes
us chumps and God's a sadist.

398
00:27:27,351 --> 00:27:31,553
And either way I
got no use for him.

399
00:27:31,588 --> 00:27:33,722
So what do you believe in?

400
00:27:33,757 --> 00:27:35,691
I believe in ammunition.

401
00:27:35,725 --> 00:27:38,860
<i>Tell you what, though.</i>

402
00:27:38,895 --> 00:27:41,529
Since I'm not on speaking
terms with him anymore,

403
00:27:41,563 --> 00:27:44,132
Next time you're having a
chat with the old geezer,

404
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,534
Can you ask him to sink
a few jap transports

405
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:48,502
And have them all
fall on their bayonets

406
00:27:48,537 --> 00:27:51,938
So I can get the fuck
out of here and go home?

407
00:27:51,973 --> 00:27:55,140
I sure would appreciate it.

408
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,480
You go ahead and keep it.

409
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,515
I don't know why I have
it in the first place.

410
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,117
No, thanks.

411
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:12,789

00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:38,564
( explosion )

524
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:42,700
- Keep moving!
- Ahh!

525
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:50,872
<i>( man barking orders ) let's go!</i>

526
00:38:55,078 --> 00:38:56,913
<i>Covering fire!</i>

527
00:38:56,947 --> 00:38:59,215
( firing )

528
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:04,219
<i>Shift left!</i>

529
00:39:11,826 --> 00:39:14,929
- Ahh!
- Oh, fuck!

530
00:39:14,964 --> 00:39:17,332
<i>Keep the fire on them!</i>

531
00:39:24,975 --> 00:39:27,244
<i>( man barking orders )</i>

532
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:30,547
( grunts )

533
00:39:30,581 --> 00:39:33,885
Oh, bill. Bill.

534
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:36,088
Dropped my fucking weapon.

535
00:39:36,122 --> 00:39:39,357
Corpsman! Corpsman!

536
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:42,192
Corpsman!

537
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,495
Corpsman!

538
00:39:47,764 --> 00:39:49,997
Hey, everything's
gonna be fine. Bill!

539
00:39:50,032 --> 00:39:52,865
It ain't shit.
Everything's gonna be fine.

540
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:56,835
It ain't shit.

541
00:40:00,105 --> 00:40:03,106
Damn it! Corpsman!

542
00:40:04,241 --> 00:40:07,378
There you are, God damn it!

543
00:40:07,412 --> 00:40:09,113
Pressure! Pressure!

544
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:13,049
- Sorry.
- What?

545
00:40:18,487 --> 00:40:21,421
<i>Bill? - Corpsman:
Help me carry him back.</i>

546
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:23,655
Bill?

547
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:28,826
Bill?

548
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,561
Bill?

549
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,964
<i>( gunfire continues )</i>

550
00:40:51,346 --> 00:40:53,780
Son of a bitch.
Those are jap tanks.

551
00:40:53,814 --> 00:40:55,581
( gunfire continues )

552
00:40:55,616 --> 00:40:59,385
Mortars! Get me some h.E.
On those sons of bitches!

553
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,753
( men shout in Japanese )

554
00:41:01,788 --> 00:41:04,221
- Now! Let's go, let's go.
- You heard the lieutenant.

555
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:06,422
Let's go! Move out!

556
00:41:11,596 --> 00:41:14,966
Hold here, hold here!

557
00:41:16,602 --> 00:41:18,169
Burgin: 250... three rounds, h.E.!

558
00:41:18,203 --> 00:41:20,437
<i>Snafu: 250... three rounds, h.E.!</i>

559
00:41:28,613 --> 00:41:30,280
Hot load!

560
00:41:31,282 --> 00:41:33,916
- Hanging!
- Snafu: Fire!

561
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:37,586
- Hanging!

562
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:42,124
Drop 2-5.

563
00:41:43,726 --> 00:41:46,527
( men scream in Japanese )

564
00:41:47,729 --> 00:41:49,295

565
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,498

Round's complete.

569
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:18,311
Fall back 50 and dig in!

570
00:42:18,346 --> 00:42:21,612
<i>- Let's go!
- Oh, shit.</i>

571
00:42:21,647 --> 00:42:24,747
<i>- Shit!
- Fall back!</i>

572
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,590
Fuck!

573
00:42:49,163 --> 00:42:52,465
<i>- ( planes passing )

574
00:42:52,499 --> 00:42:54,633
<i>( explosion )</i>

575
00:42:56,968 --> 00:43:00,235
Chuckler. Chuckler.

576
00:43:02,237 --> 00:43:04,236
You see chuckler or runner?

577
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:06,004
Who?

578
00:43:06,038 --> 00:43:07,838
Juergins or conley? H-2-1?

579
00:43:07,872 --> 00:43:09,406
Never heard of them.

580
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:15,441
<i>Man: Lieutenant wants us up front.
Let's go!</i>

581
00:43:20,378 --> 00:43:22,145
Leckie! Leckie!

582
00:43:22,179 --> 00:43:23,912
Runner!

583
00:43:26,983 --> 00:43:29,783
- Are you okay?
- Thirsty.

584
00:43:36,152 --> 00:43:39,386
Hoosier got hit.

585
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,019
<i>( gunfire )</i>

586
00:43:41,053 --> 00:43:42,619
<i>Man: Keep moving, keep moving.</i>

587
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:45,086
<i>Let's go, let's go!</i>

588
00:43:49,723 --> 00:43:51,657
You going asiatic?

589
00:43:53,426 --> 00:43:55,160
Feet are soaking wet.

590
00:43:58,196 --> 00:44:00,197
What you gonna do in
your stockin' feet

591
00:44:00,231 --> 00:44:03,299
When the fucking japs
bust through the line?

592
00:44:23,511 --> 00:44:26,043
<i>( distant gunfire continues )</i>

593
00:44:46,285 --> 00:44:47,851
<i>( bomb whistling )</i>

594
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:53,221
- ( all shouting )
- Get back! Take cover!

595
00:44:59,492 --> 00:45:01,325
You men got enough ammo?

596
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,393
<i>Snafu: Sure thing, skipper.</i>

597
00:45:03,428 --> 00:45:06,861
Perimeter's 30yds
out from your hole.

598
00:45:06,896 --> 00:45:07,961
L.P.'s out beyond that.

599
00:45:07,995 --> 00:45:10,195
<i>The password's "lilliputian."</i>

600
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:12,627
One man awake at all times.

601
00:45:15,762 --> 00:45:17,094
Lilliputian?

602
00:45:17,129 --> 00:45:20,196
Hard for the japs to say.

603
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:23,663
Hard for me to say.

604
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,131
Trade you.

605
00:45:44,872 --> 00:45:48,208
Shit, I forgot about that guy.

606
00:46:03,351 --> 00:46:06,386
<i>( distant gunfire continues )</i>

607
00:46:09,188 --> 00:46:12,091
( blade scrapes )

608
00:46:17,365 --> 00:46:20,168
We're rich, boys.

609
00:46:22,506 --> 00:46:25,173
Jap's got a shitload
of gold in his teeth.

610
00:46:26,308 --> 00:46:29,175
<i>Gold is what? Bucks an ounce?</i>

611
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:44,918
Take the first watch.
Wake me up in four hours.

612
00:46:44,953 --> 00:46:47,454
Anything moves, kill it.

613
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,622
<i>( gunfire continues )</i>

614
00:47:08,623 --> 00:47:11,456
<i>( haney muttering )</i>

615
00:47:24,764 --> 00:47:27,298
Look at that.

616
00:47:32,302 --> 00:47:35,537
You ever been to the grand canyon?

617
00:47:35,572 --> 00:47:37,707
No.

618
00:47:37,741 --> 00:47:40,711
My dad went when he was a boy.

619
00:47:40,745 --> 00:47:44,117
He was always going on
about it when I was little.

620
00:47:44,151 --> 00:47:47,756
I'd ask him about it.
He said I had to see it to understand.

621
00:47:49,925 --> 00:47:52,427
<i>We got there late at night
to these cabins.</i>

622
00:47:52,461 --> 00:47:55,396
<i>Couldn't see a thing on
account of the dark.</i>

623
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:57,598
<i>Next morning we got up,</i>

624
00:47:57,632 --> 00:47:59,899
Went outside...

625
00:47:59,933 --> 00:48:03,703
10yds from where we slept,
the fucking grand canyon.

626
00:48:03,737 --> 00:48:08,674
<i>A mile down, colors I'd
never seen before.</i>

627
00:48:08,708 --> 00:48:12,877
<i>My dad was right:
Pictures don't show it.</i>

628
00:48:14,513 --> 00:48:16,447
You have to be there

629
00:48:16,482 --> 00:48:18,483
Looking down into it.

630
00:48:20,587 --> 00:48:23,422
Shut the fuck up, you idiot.

631
00:48:28,831 --> 00:48:31,367
We have to go out there tomorrow.
