00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:36,700
Announcer:
400 YEARS AFTER THE LAST KING
WAS DRIVEN FROM THE CITY,

3
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:39,501
THE REPUBLIC OF ROME
RULES MANY NATIONS,

4
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:41,733
BUT CANNOT RULE ITSELF.

5
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,301
THE CITY IS CONSTANTLY
ROILED BY CONFLICT

6
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:48,767
BETWEEN THE COMMON PEOPLE
AND THE NOBILITY.

7
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:52,334
POWER IS SHARED
AND ORDER MAINTAINED

8
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:54,601
BY TWO SOLDIERS--
OLD FRIENDS--

9
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:59,000
GNAEUS POMPEY MAGNUS
AND GAIUS JULIUS CAESAR.

10
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:03,100
ONCE, POMPEY WAS ACKNOWLEDGED
BY ALL TO BE THE GREATER MAN,

11
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:07,334
BUT FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS,
WHILE POMPEY HAS KEPT
THE PEACE IN ROME,

12
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:10,501
CAESAR HAS WAGED A WAR
OF CONQUEST IN GAUL

13
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:13,467
THAT HAS MADE HIM
EVER MORE RICH AND POPULAR.

14
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:15,767
THE BALANCE
OF POWER IS SHIFTING,

15
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,367
AND THE NOBILITY
HAVE GROWN FEARFUL.

16
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:20,367
THOUGH OF NOBLE BLOOD
HIMSELF,

17
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:23,134
CAESAR STANDS
WITH THE COMMON PEOPLE.

18
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:27,401
A MAN LIKE THAT--
AN ARISTOCRAT WITH
SOLDIERS, MONEY

19
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:31,267
AND THE LOVE OF THE PEOPLE--
MIGHT MAKE HIMSELF KING.

20
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:34,267
( clamoring )

21
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,067
( yelling )

22
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:47,967
( whistle blows )

23
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,833
( yells )

24
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,000
( whistle blows )

25
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:29,000
( grunting )

26
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,267
PULLO, FORMATION!

27
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:37,934
- ( screams )
- PULLO!

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,067
SINGLE FORMATION!

29
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:44,934
SHIELDS ON ME!

30
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,301
GET BACK IN FORMATION,
YOU DRUNKEN FOOL.

31
00:04:10,568 --> 00:04:13,434
REFORM!

32
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:18,900
Man:
LEGIONARY TITUS PULLO
IS A HERO OF THE 13th LEGION,

33
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,767
- BUT LOOK AT HIM NOW.
- ( whip cracking )

34
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:24,000
JUSTICE KNOWS
EVERY MAN'S NUMBER.

35
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:26,967
HE HAS COMMITTED
A TERRIBLE SACRILEGE,

36
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,967
AND HE WILL PAY FOR IT
WITH HIS LIFE!

37
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:34,534
AS WILL ANY MAN HERE
WHO BREAKS THE LAW.

38
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:37,967
BRAWLERS AND DRUNKARDS
WILL BE FLOGGED.

39
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:41,167
THIEVES WILL BE STRANGLE

40
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:45,733
DESERTERS
WILL BE CRUCIFIED.

41
00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:55,000
IS THAT IT?

42
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:57,434
I WAS JUST BEGINNING
TO ENJOY MYSELF.

43
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:12,767
Man:
BEFORE YOU...

44
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:16,201
VERCINGETORIX,
SON OF CELTIL,

45
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:19,067
CHIEFTAIN OF THE TRIBE
OF THE ARVERNI,

46
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:22,700
COMMANDER OF THE REBEL
STRONGHOLD OF ELYSIA,

47
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:24,967
KING OF ALL THE GAULS.

48
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,134
WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE OF HIM?

49
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,601
- ( unleashes sword )
- CAESAR!

50
00:05:51,668 --> 00:05:53,501
- ( soldiers cheering )
- CAESAR!

51
00:05:53,568 --> 00:05:54,967
CAESAR!

52
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:59,301
( soldiers chanting )
CAESAR! CAESAR! CAESAR!

53
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,334
HEY!

54
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,167
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

55
00:06:20,234 --> 00:06:22,734
HEY-- HERE!

56
00:06:24,368 --> 00:06:27,433
YOU PISS-DRINKING
SONS OF CIRCUS WHORES!

57
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,400
THE CHIEF OF THE GAULS
HAS SURRENDERED TO CAESAR.

58
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:32,268
THE WAR IS OVER.

59
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,101
DON'T SATHATY

60
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,034
THE BOYS HAVE BEEN GIVEN
TWO DAYS LIBERTY

61
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:40,734
TO SACK THE TOWN
AND TAKE PERSONAL SPOILS.

62
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,301
THEY'LL ALL BE RICH.

63
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:45,400
AND ME IN HERE!

64
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:47,134
HEY!

65
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:53,734
- ( woman screaming )
- COME ON, GET IN THERE!

66
00:06:54,934 --> 00:06:57,268
400 DENARII?
ARE YOU INSANE?

67
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,934
THAT'S A FLOOR PRICE.

68
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:03,001
WE'LL PAY THE USUAL PREMIUM
FOR TRADESMEN AND FERTILE
WOMEN, ET CETERA.

69
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:05,667
FROM POMPEY MAGNUS, SIR.

70
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:08,834
Man:
SET THE FLOOR
CLOSEREIGH TO

71
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:10,967
( trader laughs )

72
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:16,167
Pompey's voice:
"MY DEAR FRIEND
AND PARTNER, GAIUS,

73
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:17,934
I HAVE TERRIBLE NEWS."

74
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:20,834
Woman:
FORGIVE ME.

75
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:22,834
FORGIVE ME.

76
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,201
I FORGIVE YOU.
I FORGIVE YOU.

77
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,433
- BE GOOD TO MY SLAVES.
- I WILL.

78
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,368
AND Y FATO MER.

79
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:34,067
I WILL.

80
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:39,334
( grunts )

81
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:42,400
KISS ME.

82
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:52,234
YOUR HAIR.

83
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:55,767
FUNNY.

84
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:16,734
Man:
THIS ISN'T MISERABLE
EASTERN PEASANTRY.

85
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,901
THIS IS THE CREME
OF THE GALLIC NATIONS.

86
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:21,433
A GLUT ON THE MARKET.
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO GIVE THEM AWAY.

87
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,934
- SEVEN, AND BE DONE WITH IT.
- ON DELIVERY TO MASILIA?

88
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:27,101
- OH, PLEASE!
- AGREED. SEE TO THE DETAILS.

89
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:32,467
I HOPE YOU GOT
A DECENT PRICE OFF
THOSE PARASITES.

90
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:37,201
GOOD ENOUGH.

91
00:08:40,134 --> 00:08:42,001
NEWS FROM ROME?

92
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:45,767
POMPEY WRITES.

93
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:50,034
MY DAUGHTER JULIA
HAS DIED IN CHILDBIRTH.

94
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:05,533
I GRIEVE WITH YOU.

95
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,533
THE CHILD?

96
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,034
A GIRL-- STILLBORN.

97
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:28,034
POMPEY WILL BE NEEDING
A NEW WIFE.

98
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:33,201
( crowd chanting )
CAESAR! AESAR!  CAESAR!

99
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:41,734
MORE OF CAESAR'S SPOILS
FROM GAUL.

100
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:48,201
( tingchanontinues )
CAESAR! CAESAR!

101
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:18,034
WHAT A DREADFUL NOISE
PLEBS MAKE WHEN THEY'RE HAPPY.

102
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:20,367
THIS IS MUSIC.

103
00:10:20,434 --> 00:10:24,367
WAIT UNTIL CAESAR
STARTS THEM HOWLING
FOR OUR BLOOD.

104
00:10:24,434 --> 00:10:26,767
THEN YOU'LL HEAR
SOMETHING DREADFUL.

105
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:17,301
Man:
A FINE REWARD IS OFFERED

106
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:19,401
FOR THE RETURN
OF A SLAVEWOMAN,

107
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:21,967
STOLEN OR ABSCONDED

108
00:11:22,034 --> 00:11:25,867
FROM THE HOUSE
OF MARIUS DOLABELLA.

109
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:29,167
UNDER THE PROTECTION
OF POMPEY MAGNUS

110
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:33,101
AND JULIUS CAESAR,
SENATE SITS TOMORROW.

111
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:34,967
BE AWARE!

112
00:11:35,034 --> 00:11:37,800
NO DISORDER
WILL BE TOLERATED.

113
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:42,234
Man #2:
YES, THEY COME FROM
A PALMERIAN SOURCE.

114
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:51,967
( man and woman moaning )

115
00:12:08,334 --> 00:12:11,600
- ( woman moans loudly )
- ( man grunts, laughs )

116
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,367
THAT WAS
LOVELY, TIMON.

117
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:24,600
TWO STALLIONS
HAVE COME TO ROME TODAY.

118
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:29,034
OF COURSE,

119
00:12:29,101 --> 00:12:31,167
HOW CHILDISH OF ME.

120
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:34,334
- YOU WANT THE HORSE.
- I DO.

121
00:12:34,401 --> 00:12:36,134
BUT DON'T
BE SULLEN NOW.

122
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:37,900
THIS WAS NOT
A HARDSHIP F ME.

123
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:40,600
I'VE ALWAYS FOUND SOMETHING
PERVERSELY EROTIC

124
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,867
ABOUT GOATY LITTLE MEN.

125
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,900
( water splashing )

126
00:12:52,101 --> 00:12:55,101
DO PLEASE DON'T LURK,
OCTAVIAN. COME IN.

127
00:12:58,934 --> 00:13:01,568
DON'T BE A GOOSE.
COME IN.

128
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:16,301
I'VE BOUGHT A HORSE.

129
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:18,200
HAVE YOU?

130
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:21,867
THE BEST HORSE IN ROME
BY ALL ACCOUNTS.

131
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,701
VERYI'M APPY
FOR YOU.

132
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:25,501
IT'S A GIFT
FOR YOUR GREAT-UNC

133
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:27,933
I WANT YOU TO TAKE
THE ANIMAL TO GAUL

134
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,234
AND GIVE ITTO HIM IN PERSON.

135
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:33,901
- WHY?
- WELL, WHEN HE'S
BACK IN ROME,

136
00:13:33,968 --> 00:13:37,167
EVERYONE WILL BE
GIVING HIM GIFTS.
WE MUST BE FIRST.

137
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:39,567
I DOUBT HE WILL RETURN
TO ROME ANYTIME SOON.

138
00:13:39,634 --> 00:13:41,300
THE SENATE'S HOSTILITY
WILL PREVENT HIM.

139
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:44,567
- LEGALLEAKING, IT IS NOT--
- PLEASE DON'T START
SPEAKING LEGALLY.

140
00:13:44,634 --> 00:13:47,234
- YOU KNOW HOW IT BORES ME.
- IT'S A LONG WAY TO GAUL.

141
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,734
EXACTLY.
WHILE YET A MERE BOY,

142
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:52,667
YOU WOULD RISK YOUR LIFE
TO HONOR YOUR BELOVED
GREAT-UNCLE.

143
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:56,567
YOU RIDE
INTO CAESAR'S CAMP ALONE,
ON A NOBLE WHITE STALLION.

144
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:58,700
THAT'S A GIFT
HE WON'T SOON FORGET.

145
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:01,034
- ALONE?
- WELL, YOU'LL HAVE
PLENTY OF SLAVES.

146
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:02,834
YOU'LL BE PERFECTLY SAFE.

147
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,867
AND YOU'LL MAKE YOUR MAMMA
VERY PROUD AND HAPPY.

148
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:10,900
( men jeering )

149
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,533
CATO,
THE SENATE HEARS YOU.

150
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,167
POMPEY MAGNUS...

151
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:24,633
I HAVE A QUESTION CONCERNING
YOUR FRIEND AND CO-CONSUL--

152
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,533
THE DARLING OF VENUS,
GAIUS JULIUS CAESAR.

153
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,800
WHY DOES HIS CHAIR
REMAIN EMPTY?

154
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:34,134
WHY DOES HE NOT COME HOME?
HIS ILLEGAL WAR IS OVER.

155
00:14:34,201 --> 00:14:35,900
( je ing )

156
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:37,934
GAUL IS LONG SINCE
ON IT'S KNEES.

157
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:41,800
WHY DOES CAESAR
KEEP HIS BRAVE SOLDIERS

158
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:45,267
FROM THEIR FAMILIES
AND FRIENDS?

159
00:14:48,633 --> 00:14:50,434
FOR EIGHT LONG YEARS,

160
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,600
HE HAS GORGED HIMSELF
LIKE A WOLF

161
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:54,567
ON THE BLOOD OF GAUL,

162
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:57,734
AND THEREBY MADE HIMSELF
MONSTROUSLY RICH.

163
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,834
- WHY?
- SIT DOWN!

164
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,167
WHY DOES HE PLY THE MOB
WITH RACES AND FIGHTS
AND GAUDY FEASTS?

165
00:15:04,234 --> 00:15:06,567
WHY HAS HE PAID THE DEBTS

166
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:11,267
OF EVERY REPROBATE FOOL
IN THIS SENATE HOUSE?

167
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:13,101
WHY?!

168
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:18,734
I'LL TELL YOU WHY
HE DOES THESE THINGS.

169
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,734
HE WANTS TO BUY HIMSELF
A CROWN.

170
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:23,767
HE WANTS TO DESTROY
THE REPUBLIC

171
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:27,067
AND RULE ROME
AS A BLOODY TYRANT!

172
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,267
- THAT'S WHY!
- ( jeering intensifies )

173
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,600
THEREFORE, I MOVE...

174
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:40,800
THAT CAESAR'S
GOVERNORSHIP IN GAUL
BE TERMINATED IMMEDIATELY,

175
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:42,967
THAT HIS ARMIES
BE DISBANDED

176
00:15:43,034 --> 00:15:44,934
AND THAT HE BE RECALLED
TO ROME TO ANSWER CHARGES

177
00:15:45,001 --> 00:15:46,967
OF ILLEGAL WARFARE,

178
00:15:47,034 --> 00:15:50,267
THEFT, BRIBERY
AND TREASON!

179
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:54,001
( minority jeering
continues )

180
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:04,034
VERY GOOD, CATO.

181
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:06,734
FULL OF VIM AND VERVE,
AS USUAL.

182
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,267
CAESAR...

183
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:11,533
HAS BEEN GENEROUS
TO THE PEOPLE

184
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,101
BECAUSE HE LOVES
THE PEOPLE AS I DO.

185
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:21,234
IT IS THE PEOPLE THAT RULE,
NOU FINE NOBLEMAN.

186
00:16:21,301 --> 00:16:23,600
IT IS POMPEY'S SOLDIERS
THAT RULE,

187
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:25,567
NOT WE FINE NOBLEMAN.

188
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:29,734
I'M GOING TO SAVE US ALL
HOURS OF USELESS CLAMOR

189
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,934
AND USE MY CONSULAR VETO
ON YOUR MOTION.

190
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:35,533
- YES!
- Pompey: I DO NOT--

191
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,700
- I DO NOT--
-SILENCE!

192
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:44,101
ARE WE CHILDREN?
LET THE CONSUL SPEAK

193
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,700
THANK YOU, CICERO.

194
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:47,633
- I DO NOT--
- HOWEVER...

195
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,368
IF I MIGHT SAY
A FEW WORDS BEFORE
YOU CONTINUE.

196
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:56,301
WHEN CONFRONTED
BY A HUNGRY WOLF,

197
00:16:56,368 --> 00:16:58,767
IT IS UNWISE
TO GOAD THE BEAST,

198
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:00,967
AS CATO WOULD HAVE US DO.

199
00:17:01,034 --> 00:17:04,600
BUT IT IS EQUALLY UNWISE

200
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:06,867
TO IMAGINE
THE SNARLING ANIMAL

201
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:09,500
A FRIEND
AND OFFER YOUR HAND

202
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:11,067
AS POMPEY DOES.

203
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:13,533
PERHAPS YOU WOULD
HAVE US CLIMB A TREE.

204
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,567
( laughing )

205
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:22,067
CAESAR IS MY BROTHER
BY SACRED OATH.

206
00:17:22,134 --> 00:17:25,633
I KNOW HIS HEART.
HE IS MY FRIEND

207
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,301
AND A FAITHFUL
SON OF THE REPUBLIC.

208
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:30,934
AND UNTIL ANYONE PROVES
THAT HE IS NOT,

209
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:32,600
I WILL NEVER BETRAY HIM.

210
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:38,500
- ( crowd laughing )
- ( flute playing )

211
00:17:54,468 --> 00:17:56,468
( crowd erupts
in laughter )

212
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,401
POMPEY MAGNUS,
MY DEAR FELLOW,
YOU'RE WELL MET.

213
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:03,401
SCIPIO, CATO.

214
00:18:03,468 --> 00:18:06,101
I WOULD NOT TAKE YOU
FOR LOVERS OF THE MIME.

215
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:09,267
YOU KNOW MY DAUGHTER,
CORNELIA.

216
00:18:09,334 --> 00:18:12,734
WIDOW OF NOBLE PUBLIUS
WHO DIED AT CARRHAE.

217
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,567
CORNELIA, YOUR HUSBAND
WAS A FINE ROMAN.

218
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:18,134
I THANK YOU.

219
00:18:19,401 --> 00:18:22,267
FATHER, MY PRESENCE
IS NOT APPROPRIATE.

220
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,967
THERE'S A LEWD WOMAN
ON THE STAGE.

221
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:27,633
I HAD NO NOTION.

222
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,234
WE WILL NOT
LINGER THEN.

223
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:32,401
POMPEY,
A PLEASANT GOOD NIGHT.

224
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,600
IF IT PLEASE YOU,
MIGHT WE SPEAK ALONE?

225
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,134
NEITHER
WE ARISTOCRATS ALONE

226
00:18:45,201 --> 00:18:47,600
NOR YOU
AND YOUR SOLDIERS ALONE
CAN CRUSH CAESAR.

227
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,267
STOP THERE.

228
00:18:49,334 --> 00:18:51,468
I DO NOT SAY THAT
YOU WISH TO CRUSH CAESAR,

229
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:54,267
I ONLY SAY
THAT IF YOU DID WISH IT,
YOU COULD NOT DO IT ALONE.

230
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:57,800
I HAVE NO NEED
OF YOU NOBLE GENTLEMAN.

231
00:18:57,867 --> 00:18:59,834
I HAVE ONLY
TO STAMP MY FEET

232
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,468
AND LEGIONS WILL SPRING UP
ALL OVER ITALY!

233
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:05,468
I CAN SQUASH CAESAR
LIKE AN INSECT

234
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:07,500
IF I WISHED IT SO.

235
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:09,401
I DO NOT WISH IT.

236
00:19:10,434 --> 00:19:12,334
RENOUNCE HIM, POMPEY!

237
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,267
RENOUNCE CAESAR!

238
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:17,700
ALLY YOURSELF WITH US
AND HIS STRENGTH WILL
WITHER AWAY.

239
00:19:17,767 --> 00:19:20,034
IT IS YOU WHO IS
THE REAL POWER.

240
00:19:20,101 --> 00:19:22,867
IT IS YOU
THE PEOPLE TRULY LOVE.

241
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:25,401
THINK YOU THEY WILL
STILL SHOUT CAESAR'S NAME

242
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:27,967
WHEN HE RUNS OUT
OF GALLIC TRINKETS
TO THROW TO THEM?

243
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:31,301
THINK YOU I CARE
WH AAMESAT NRE SHOUTED
IN THE STREETS?

244
00:19:31,368 --> 00:19:34,600
NOTHING IS
MORE IMPORTANT.

245
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,468
YOU ASK ME
TO OPENLY BETRAY A FRIEND.

246
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:42,401
I CANNOT DO IT.

247
00:19:42,468 --> 00:19:44,067
GOOD NIGHT.

248
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:20,934
EVERYTHING
WILL BALL RIGHT.

249
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,101
IS HE NOT PERFECT?
PROPER LITTLE SOLDIER.

250
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,101
- Octavia: HE'S SCARED.
- Atia: NONSENSE.

251
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:33,834
ROMAN MEN
ARE NEVER SCARED.

252
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,368
HE'S JUST SAD
TO BE LEAVING HIS MAMMA.

253
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,633
YOU'RE NOT SCARED,
ARE YOU, OCTAVIAN?

254
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,800
OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT.
TIME FLIES.

255
00:20:39,867 --> 00:20:42,368
GIVE ME A KISS,
MY LOVE.

256
00:20:45,234 --> 00:20:47,700
ANDROS...

257
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:49,867
BRING HIM BACK SAFE
OR I'LL USE THE EYES

258
00:20:49,934 --> 00:20:52,201
OF YOUR CHILDREN
FOR BEADS.

259
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:21,401
LYCO, THE HORSE--
NOT TOO EXPENSIVE I HOPE.

260
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:24,533
I'M SORRY, SIR,
THE HORSE WAS SOLD ALREADY.

261
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,034
- TO ATIA OF THE JULII.
- ATIA?

262
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:29,067
SHE'S SENDING IT TO GAUL--

263
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:31,067
A GIFT FOR CAESAR.

264
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:39,034
DAMN HIM!

265
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:41,201
MUST HE HAVE EVERYTHING?

266
00:21:44,368 --> 00:21:47,267
AS YOU WERE GOING
TO BE IN GAUL ANYWAY,

267
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:51,167
I MIGHT KILL
TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE.

268
00:21:51,234 --> 00:21:53,234
( ominous music
playing )

269
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:22,267
( grunts )

270
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,967
LET ME LOOK AT YOU.

271
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:30,801
AS UGLY AS EVER,
I'M AFRAID.

272
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,001
NOT AT ALL.
AGE SUITS YOU, BRUTUS.

273
00:23:33,068 --> 00:23:34,767
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?

274
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:37,567
- FIVE YEARS?
- NO, SIX.

275
00:23:37,634 --> 00:23:39,767
OH, HOW CLEVER.

276
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:41,967
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
A PROPER HOUSE.

277
00:23:43,634 --> 00:23:45,200
OH...

278
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,801
I DEEPLY REGRET
YOUR LOSS.

279
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,901
JULIA AND SO FORTH.
HORRIBLE BUSINESS.

280
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:53,834
CONDOLENCES, REALLY.

281
00:23:57,433 --> 00:23:59,400
NOW TELL ME,
HOW'S YOUR MOTHER?

282
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:01,368
THE SAME AS EVER.

283
00:24:01,433 --> 00:24:03,400
SHE SENDS HER LOVE,
DEMANDS TO KNOW

284
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:05,433
WHY YOU HAVEN'T
WRITTEN TO HER IN MONTHS.

285
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,034
I CAN REMEDY THAT
IF YOU'LL BE MY COURIER.

286
00:24:08,101 --> 00:24:10,901
I HAVE SEVERAL LETTERS
TO SEND.

287
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:13,567
IF I CAN EVER BRING MYSELF
TO GET ON ANOTHER HORSE.

288
00:24:13,634 --> 00:24:15,901
I HAD NO CPTIOONCE
THAT GAUL WAS SO FAR AWAY.

289
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:17,967
BRUTUS,
ME OLD COCK...

290
00:24:18,034 --> 00:24:19,934
WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

291
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,700
MARK ANTONY,
HOW NICE.

292
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:23,901
I'VE BEEN VISITING
MY COUSIN IN N.

293
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:26,267
OH? HOW IS THAT IDIOT
COUSIN OF YOURS?

294
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:29,201
- HE WAS--
- ACTUALLY, I'M SORRY,
I'M IN A BIT OF A RUSH.

295
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:31,867
I NEED, SAY,
A HALF TALENT OF GOLD.

296
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:35,567
- DO YOU?
- SEE HOW HE TRUSTS ME.

297
00:24:35,634 --> 00:24:38,634
- FOR THE EAGLE.
- OF COURSE. STRABO!

298
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:42,868
GIVE HIS HONOR MARK ANTONY
A HALF TALENT OF GOLD.

299
00:24:42,934 --> 00:24:46,100
- A HALF TALENT OF GOLD.
- AND NOT A PENNY MORE.

300
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:48,100
- DOMINUS.
( Antony chuckles )

301
00:24:51,901 --> 00:24:54,467
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU TOLERATE THAT MAN.

302
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,534
HE LIKES TO FIGHT.

303
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:59,534
THE WAY HE CARRIES ON,
ONE MIGHT THINK HE CAME
FROM NO FAMILY AT ALL.

304
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:02,367
HE DOES HAVE
A VULGARIAN STREAK.
I DON'T MIND IT.

305
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:05,601
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT
THE EAGLE?

306
00:25:09,701 --> 00:25:13,467
MY PERSONAL STANDARD
S STOLEN BY BRIGANDS.

307
00:25:13,534 --> 00:25:15,133
A BAD BUSINESS.

308
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:18,200
THE LEGIONS WERE ALREADY
HOMESICK AND SURLY WHEN
THE EAGLE WAS TAKEN,

309
00:25:18,234 --> 00:25:20,167
NOW THEY'RE
POSITIVELY MUTINOUS.

310
00:25:20,234 --> 00:25:22,367
THE MEN THINK IT'S
A SURE SIGN OF MY DOOM,

311
00:25:22,434 --> 00:25:25,434
AND THEY'RE CLAMORING
LIKE GEESE FOR DISBAND.

312
00:25:25,501 --> 00:25:28,234
THEY DID NOT SEEM
SO UNHAPPY.

313
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,634
WELL, THEY NEVER
FLAUNT THEISCONTENT.
GETS THEM WHIPPED.

314
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:33,934
I TELL YOU, BRUTUS,

315
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,834
I'M AT MY WITS END.

316
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:55,367
MASTER OCTAVIAN...

317
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:58,634
VASIO IS ONLY
A FEW MORE MILES.

318
00:25:58,701 --> 00:26:00,934
DO NOT TOUCH ME
WITHOUT PERMISSION.

319
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:03,901
WATER.

320
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:09,100
( grunting )

321
00:26:11,367 --> 00:26:13,300
( horse neighing )

322
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:17,367
( grunts )

323
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,367
LUCIORENUS V.

324
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:50,168
YOU HAVE A BRAIN.

325
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:54,801
SO THE TRIBUNES SAY.

326
00:26:54,867 --> 00:26:58,467
SO TELL ME,
IF IT WERE YOU WHO HAD
TO RETRIEVE CAESAR'S EAGLE,

327
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,200
HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT IT?

328
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:04,967
, I'D TAKE CAPTIVES
FROM EVERY TRIBE IN GAUL

329
00:27:05,034 --> 00:27:06,634
AND CRUCIFY THEM
ONE BY ONE

330
00:27:06,701 --> 00:27:08,967
UNTIL SOMEONE TELLS ME
WHERE THE EAGLE IS.

331
00:27:09,034 --> 00:27:11,934
THEN, I WOULD
GO IN QUICK AND QUIET
WITH ONE OR TWO MEN

332
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:14,101
AND... STEAL IT BACK.

333
00:27:14,168 --> 00:27:16,934
GOOD.
WE ARE OF ONE MIND.

334
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:19,167
- DO IT.
- DO IT, SIR?

335
00:27:19,234 --> 00:27:21,334
WELL, I BELIEVE THERE'S
A TORTURE DETACHMENT
WITH THE THIRD,

336
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,368
BUT YOU MAY CHOOSE
YOUR OWN MEN IF YOU WISH.

337
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:26,433
( coins rattling )

338
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,834
THERE'S
A QUARTER TALENT THERE,
FOR BRIBES AND SUCH.

339
00:27:34,901 --> 00:27:38,101
- SPEND IT WISELY.
- SIR.

340
00:27:40,268 --> 00:27:42,400
( man screaming )

341
00:27:51,734 --> 00:27:54,067
NO! PLEASE LET ME DOWN!

342
00:27:54,134 --> 00:27:56,934
LET ME DOWN!

343
00:27:57,001 --> 00:27:59,034
( screams )

344
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:03,500
LET ME DOWN! I KNOW--
I KNOW WHERE THE EAGLE IS.

345
00:28:03,567 --> 00:28:05,934
- SPEAK.
- THE BLUE SPANIARDS,

346
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:08,734
THEY CAME TO STAY
FOR ONE NIGHT...

347
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,467
AND THEN RODE
TO THE CADURCI LANDS.

348
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:14,467
PLEASE! PLEASE PLEASE.
LET ME DOWN.

349
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:17,434
CADURCI.

350
00:28:17,501 --> 00:28:20,201
( sighs )
FORTUNE PISSES ON ME.

351
00:28:20,267 --> 00:28:22,867
- PLEASE LET ME DOWN!
- TAKE THEM DOWN.

352
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:28,401
FORCULUS,

353
00:28:28,468 --> 00:28:31,134
IF YOU BE THE RIGHT GOD
FOR THE BUSINESS HERE,

354
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:32,800
I CALL ON YOU
TO HELP ME.

355
00:28:32,867 --> 00:28:34,867
IF YOU WILL OPEN
THIS DOOR,

356
00:28:34,934 --> 00:28:37,834
THEN I WILL KILL FOR YOU
A FINE WHITE LAMB,

357
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:40,233
OR, FAILING THAT,
IF I COULDN'T GET A GOOD ONE
AT A DECT PRICE,

358
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,534
THEN SIX PIGEONS.

359
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,600
THIS, FORCULUS,
I VOW TO YOU.

360
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,934
LEGIONARY TITUS PULLO,
STAND UP.

361
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,700
E RELEASED
TO THE COMMAND OF

362
00:28:57,767 --> 00:29:00,001
SECOND SPEAR CENTURION
LUCIUS VORENUS.

363
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:03,234
DO YOUR DUTY TO HIS
SATISFACTION, AND YOU'LL BE
SPARED DAMNATION IN THE ARENA.

364
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:06,567
I WON'T EVEN STAND
NEXT TO THIS SHORT-ASSED SHIT,
LEAVE ALONE SERVE UNDER HIM.

365
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:08,134
I'LL STAY HERE,
THANKS VERY MUCH.

366
00:29:08,201 --> 00:29:10,867
THESE ORDERS COME DIRECT
FROM HIS EXCELLENCY
MARK ANTONY HIMSELF.

367
00:29:10,934 --> 00:29:13,167
YOU ARE TO RETRIEVE
CAESAR'S EAGLE.

368
00:29:15,134 --> 00:29:17,633
ME, RETRIEVE
CAESAR'S EAGLE?

369
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,167
- BRUTUS?
- MAMMA!

370
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,101
( both laughing )

371
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:36,401
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW GOOD IT IS TO BE HOME.

372
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:38,034
YOU'RE AS BROWN
AS A BEAN.

373
00:29:38,101 --> 00:29:40,734
IT MAKES ME LOOK
QUITE SOLDIERLY THOUGH.

374
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,334
IT DOES, IT DOES.

375
00:29:43,401 --> 00:29:46,533
- HOW IS COUSIN MARCELLUS?
- TEDIOUS BUT HEALTHY.

376
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,234
- AND CAESAR?
- WHO?

377
00:29:48,301 --> 00:29:50,101
DON'T BE CRUEL.

378
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:52,167
IS HE WELL?
DID HE ASK OF ME?

379
00:29:52,234 --> 00:29:55,067
DID HE?
I CAN'T RECALL.

380
00:29:55,134 --> 00:29:56,734
I THINK NOT.

381
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,867
HE DID WRITE YOU
A LETTER THOUGH.

382
00:29:58,934 --> 00:30:01,134
OH, YOU BEAST.

383
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:04,533
Caesar's voice:
"DEAREST SERVILIA,
FORGIVE MY LONG SILENCE.

384
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,034
THESE LAST LONG MONTHS WERE
ALL BLOOD AND IRON AND MUD,

385
00:30:08,101 --> 00:30:10,301
AND NO TIME
FOR LETTERS TO FRIENDS.

386
00:30:10,368 --> 00:30:13,667
BE SURE THAT
I HAVE BEEN THINKING OF YOU
WITH GREAT AFFECTION.

387
00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:17,001
I LONG TO BE TOGETHER
AND ALONE WITH YOU."

388
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:23,567
"GREAT AFFECTION."

389
00:30:23,633 --> 00:30:25,633
LONGS TO BE ALONE
WITH YOU.

390
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,900
YOU THINK HE SAYS
SUCH THINGS TO HIS WIFE?

391
00:30:28,967 --> 00:30:31,533
"AFFECTION"?
WHAT'S THAT?

392
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,101
HE COULD NOT SAY "LOVE."

393
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:37,201
WOULU HAVE HIM
PLUCK A HARP?

394
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:38,800
HE'S A SOLDIER,
NOT A POET.

395
00:30:38,867 --> 00:30:40,667
( snaps fingers )
THE DAY DWINDLES.

396
00:30:40,734 --> 00:30:42,800
OUR GUESTS
WILL BE ARRIVING.

397
00:30:57,301 --> 00:31:00,633
YOU RIDE WELL,
ALMOST AS WELL AS ME.

398
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,533
PULLO, YOU WILL
ADDRESS ME CORRECTLY.

399
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,800
ALMOST AS WELL
AS ME, SIR.

400
00:31:04,867 --> 00:31:07,667
ME, I'M A NATURAL.
MY FATHER WAS A UBIAN PROBABLY.

401
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:09,800
WHERE DID YOU LEARN
TO RIDE SO NICE?

402
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,967
PLEASE YOURSELF.
ONLY TRYING TO BE PLEASANT.

403
00:31:15,034 --> 00:31:17,834
MY MOTHER'S PEOPLE
RAISED HORSES IN MUTINA.

404
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,067
MUTINA, NEAR REGGIUM?
UP ROUND THERE?

405
00:31:20,134 --> 00:31:23,034
- UP THERE.
- GOOD COUNTRY.

406
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:27,334
LISTEN, SIR, THANK YOU,
FOR TAKING ME ON THIS JOB.

407
00:31:27,401 --> 00:31:30,401
- A NOBLE WAY
TO MAKE AMENDS.
- AMENDS?

408
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:32,401
FOR GETTING ME INTO
THIS CAC BY CALLING ME NAMES.

409
00:31:32,468 --> 00:31:35,201
- THINK NOTHING OF IT.
- NEVER. I WON'T FORGET.

410
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:37,800
TITUS PULLO
NEVER FORGETS A FAVOR.

411
00:31:38,067 --> 00:31:39,733
- HAH!
- WHAT YOU MEAN, "HAH"?

412
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,867
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OUR CHANCES ARE OF
FINDING THE EAGLE?

413
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,700
13th NEVER FAILS, EH?

414
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:47,501
LITTLE OR NO CHANCE.
THE EAGLE MIGHT BE ANYWHERE.

415
00:31:47,568 --> 00:31:50,467
BURIED, MELTED DOWN,
SUNK TO BOTTOM OF THE SEA.

416
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,668
WE ARE HUNTING A BLACK DOG
IN THE NIGHT.

417
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:55,067
AND NOT FINDING THE EAGLE
IS MUCH THE SAME AS LOSING IT.

418
00:31:55,134 --> 00:31:57,034
WE WILL BE DISGRACED.
NOW, I CHOSE YOU

419
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,900
BECAUSE YOU ARE DISGRACED
ALREADY AND CONDEMNED TO DIE.

420
00:31:59,967 --> 00:32:01,467
SO YOU WEREN'T MAKING AMENDS
AT ALL, THEN?

421
00:32:01,534 --> 00:32:05,100
PULLO, IN EFFECT,
YOU'RE DEAD ALREADY.

422
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:08,800
THE LOSS OF ONE DRUNKEN FOOL
DOES LITTLE DAMAGE
TO THE LEGION.

423
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:10,601
IF I'M DEAD
ALREADY THEN, SIR,

424
00:32:10,668 --> 00:32:12,668
YOU SHOULD TAKE CARE
HOW YOU SPEAK TO ME.

425
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:14,467
IF I'VE GOT
NOTHING TO LOSE,

426
00:32:14,534 --> 00:32:17,100
WHAT'S TO STOP ME
CUTTING YOU INTO LITTLE GOBS

427
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:19,401
AND RIDING OFF, EH?

428
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:21,167
WHAT'S TO STOP ME, SIR?

429
00:32:21,234 --> 00:32:24,201
WELL, IF YOUR HONOR AS
A SOLDIER OF 13th
ISN'T ENOUGH,

430
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:26,800
THEN I'LL HAVE TO
RELY ON MY SUPERIOR
FIGHTING SKILLS.

431
00:32:26,867 --> 00:32:29,534
- SUPERIOR FIGHTING SKILLS?
- MMM.

432
00:32:29,901 --> 00:32:31,400
VERY GOOD.

433
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:36,433
D OF COURSE,
YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE
LONG HAIR DOWN TO HERE,

434
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,167
HUGE MOUSTACHES,
THE MOST HORRIFIC STENCH.

435
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:41,167
THEY EAT ONLY RAW MEAT
AND NEVER WASH.

436
00:32:41,234 --> 00:32:43,800
OH, THEY DO HAVE
ONE ADMIRABLE CUSTOM.

437
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:45,667
THEY SETTLE
THEIR POLITICAL DISPUTES

438
00:32:45,734 --> 00:32:48,500
BY SINGLE COMBAT
TO THE DEATH.

439
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:51,301
- EXCELLENT IDEA.
- ISN'T IT?

440
00:32:51,368 --> 00:32:54,268
MOTHER IS ALWAYS NAGGING ME
TO ATTEND POLITICS.

441
00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:56,867
WELL, IT'SN
BEE  OUR FAMILY'S TRADITION

442
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:58,600
AND DUTY FOR...

443
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:00,101
500 YEARS.

444
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:02,034
IT IS SUCH
DREADFULLY DULL STUFF.

445
00:33:02,101 --> 00:33:04,901
NOW YOU SEE, IF OUR SENATE
CONDUCTED BUSINESS
IN THE GERMAN STYLE,

446
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:06,567
I SHOULD
CERTAINLY GO AND WATCH.

447
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:08,700
YEAH, NO TEDIOUS LAWSUITS
AND ENDLESS DEBATES,

448
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:10,967
JUST SWORDS, DAGGERS--

449
00:33:11,034 --> 00:33:13,268
- MUCH MORE ENTERTAINING.
- BRUTUS, A WORD.

450
00:33:15,101 --> 00:33:19,834
TELL ME,
YOU ARE A GOOD JUDGE.

451
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:23,667
HOW IS MY DEAR FRIEND
CAESAR?

452
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:26,067
WELL, HE IS--

453
00:33:26,134 --> 00:33:27,800
HE'S BEEN BETTER,
I THINK.

454
00:33:27,867 --> 00:33:29,301
- MMM?
- MMM.

455
00:33:29,368 --> 00:33:32,368
VERY-- VERY WEARY,
TO BE HONEST.

456
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:34,767
- A LITTLE DEMORALIZED.
- CAESAR DEMORALIZED?

457
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:36,800
- NEVER.
- HIS STANDARD WAS STOLEN.

458
00:33:36,867 --> 00:33:38,734
HOW DID HE LET A FOOLISH THING
LIKE THAT HAPPEN?

459
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:41,934
I DON'T KNOW, BUT HIS MANNER
AND UPROAR ABOUT IT--

460
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:44,867
YOU KNOW HOW PLEBIANS
CAN BE ABOUT SUCH THINGS--

461
00:33:44,934 --> 00:33:47,268
DESPERATE TO COME HOME,
MUTINOUS.

462
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:50,634
I HAVE HEARD
THERE WAS SOME DISCONTENT,

463
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,001
BUT MUTINOUS?
HARD TO BELIEVE.

464
00:33:53,067 --> 00:33:54,967
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

465
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:57,467
AFTER ALL  DON HASHEE
FOR THEM,

466
00:33:57,533 --> 00:33:59,567
HE IS NOT SURE WHETHER
THEY WILL--

467
00:33:59,634 --> 00:34:01,500
WILL FIGHT
FOR HIM ANYMORE.

468
00:34:01,567 --> 00:34:05,567
AND THE LOWER CLASSES HAVE
A VERY VERY CRUDE SENSE
OF LOYALTY.

469
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:08,834
- NO OFFENSE.
- EH?

470
00:34:08,901 --> 00:34:11,134
I DON'T MEAN YOU.
YOU ARE LOWER CLASS,

471
00:34:11,201 --> 00:34:14,034
BUT THAT IS TO SAY,
THE LOWER CLASS
IN GENERAL, HOWEVER.

472
00:34:14,101 --> 00:34:17,433
A VERY CRUDE SENSE
OF LOYALTY.

473
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,101
EXCUSE ME.

474
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:22,467
Caesar's voice:
"MY DEAR NIECE,

475
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:24,433
I HOPE YOU
AND THE CHILDREN ARE WELL.

476
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,034
I HAVE A TASK FOR YOU.

477
00:34:26,101 --> 00:34:28,934
POLICY DICTATES I GIVE
A NEW WIFE TO POMPEY,

478
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:31,767
BUT I HAVE BEEN
GONE TOO LONG TO KNOW
WHO AMONG THE FEMALES

479
00:34:31,834 --> 00:34:33,433
OF OUR FAMILY
WOULD BE SUITABLE.

480
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,967
I WOULD ASK CALPURNIA,
BUT THOUGH AN EXCELLENT WIFE,

481
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:38,867
SHE HAS NO EYE
FOR THIS KIND OF BUSINESS.

482
00:34:38,934 --> 00:34:41,234
DO ME THE FAVOR
OF SELECTING WHICHEVER GIRL

483
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:43,034
YOU THINK
MOST LIKELY TO PLEASE

484
00:34:43,101 --> 00:34:45,734
AND OFFER HER
TO HIM IN MY NAME."

485
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:51,201
EXCUSE ME,
I WAS FAR AWAY.

486
00:34:51,268 --> 00:34:53,234
CAESAR HAS NO BAD NEWS
FOR YOU, I HOPE.

487
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:55,400
NO, NOT AT ALL.
NOT AT ALL.

488
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:57,567
- WHAT A LOVELY PARTY.
- THANK YOU.

489
00:34:57,634 --> 00:35:00,400
NOT AS LOVELY
AS YOU LIN THAT DRESS.

490
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:02,667
SHH.

491
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:06,834
AND OCTAVIA--
BEAUTIFUL.

492
00:35:06,901 --> 00:35:09,067
WELL, I TRY.

493
00:35:09,134 --> 00:35:12,301
SHE WILL INSIST
ON SLOUCHING.

494
00:35:12,368 --> 00:35:14,368
WHERE'S OCTAVIAN?

495
00:35:14,433 --> 00:35:17,234
- HE'S IN GAUL.
- OH.

496
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:22,034
- ( horse neighs )
- ( men chattering )

497
00:35:26,101 --> 00:35:28,400
- ( man grunts )
- ( men laughing )

498
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:40,600
( chanting )

499
00:35:48,034 --> 00:35:50,167
( mooing )

500
00:36:13,901 --> 00:36:16,967
( oxen groans )

501
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,467
GREAT MOTHER SAYS
NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOUR BOY.

502
00:36:38,534 --> 00:36:39,568
GOOD.

503
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,900
TELL ME NOW,
HOW GOES YOUR MARRIAGE?

504
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:48,601
GLABIUS IS A GOOD MAN.

505
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:52,100
YOU SURPRISE ME.
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE WERE
DIFFICULTIES BEN YOU.

506
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:54,367
MUST YOU ALWAYS HAVE
A NEEDLE IN HAND?

507
00:36:54,434 --> 00:36:56,833
I WAS ONLY ASKING.
EXCUSE MY CURIOSITY.

508
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,700
THERE WAS SOME DIFFICULTIES
IN THE PAST,

509
00:36:58,767 --> 00:37:00,634
BUT WE OVERCAME THEM.

510
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,833
WE LOVE EACH OTHER
VERY MUCH.

511
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,568
WELL, THAT'S A SHAME.
NOW I FEEL BAD.

512
00:37:04,634 --> 00:37:07,167
I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE OVERJOYED.

513
00:37:07,234 --> 00:37:09,267
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

514
00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:13,501
UNCLE JULIUS
INTENDS TO MARRY YOU

515
00:37:13,568 --> 00:37:16,167
TO POMPEY MAGNUS.

516
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:20,501
- UNCLE JULIUS INTENDS--
- I KNOW POMPEY IS A TOUCH
LOW IN MANNER,

517
00:37:20,568 --> 00:37:22,467
BUT I'M TOLD H
E'S A PERFECTLY ADEQUATE LOVER.

518
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:25,833
AND YOU SHALL BE
THE FIRST WOMAN IN ROME.

519
00:37:27,267 --> 00:37:29,601
WE SHALL HAVE TO GET YOU
DIVORCED FROM GLABIUS,
OBVIOUSLY.

520
00:37:29,668 --> 00:37:30,367
QUICK AS POSS.

521
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,300
i will not do it

522
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,600
i love my husband

523
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:37,334
if u do not divorce glabius, wiLLINGLY,

524
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,500
THEN CAESAR WILL ASK
GLABIUS TO DIVORCE YOU.

525
00:37:39,567 --> 00:37:42,434
- AND GLABIUS WILL REFUSE.
- DOUBTLESS, AND THEN
HE'LL BE KILLED.

526
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,367
AND DOES ANYBODY
WANT THAT TO HAPPEN?

527
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:47,767
CAESAR WOULD NOT DO THAT.

528
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:51,100
THE MAN'S BEEN IN GAUL
FOR EIGHT YEARS.

529
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:53,068
'S PRACTICALLY
A WILD BEAST.

530
00:38:07,233 --> 00:38:09,133
THE MAN HAS TEARS
IN HIS EYES.

531
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,567
TEARS.

532
00:38:11,634 --> 00:38:13,801
HE LOVES ME.

533
00:38:13,867 --> 00:38:16,434
MANISH HUSBAND
IS NO USE TO ANYONE.

534
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,500
AND YOUR SERVANTS!
WHAT A FUSS!

535
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:20,834
I THINK
YOU FEED THEM TOO MUCH.

536
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:25,767
A LITTLE MORE ARSENIC,
I THINK, GAIA.

537
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:29,200
TRY TO LOOK A LITTLE
MORE CHEERFUL, OCTAVIA.

538
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:31,634
- IT'S FOR THE GOOD
OF THE FAMILY.
- I DON'T CARE.

539
00:38:31,701 --> 00:38:34,467
YOU AND I AND YOUR BROTHER
ARE ALONE IN THE WORLD.

540
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,500
- WE HAVE TO BE STRONG.
- WE ARE NOTLONE A

541
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,901
- CAESAR IS--
- CAESAR IS IN GAUL.

542
00:38:38,968 --> 00:38:40,968
POMPEY IS HERE.

543
00:38:42,634 --> 00:38:44,701
COURAGE, MY LOVE.

544
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:55,400
THE PARTHIAN
WERE THREATENING
MY LEFT FLANK.

545
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:58,901
AND SO, RATHER THAN
SHORTEN THE LINE

546
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:00,901
AS WOULD BE
CONVENTIONAL,

547
00:39:00,968 --> 00:39:05,767
I SENT IN MY CAVALRY RESERVE
AND OUTFLANKED THE FLANKERS.

548
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:11,667
BRAVO, MAGNUS.
MASTERLY.

549
00:39:11,734 --> 00:39:14,667
IS HE NOT,
OCTAVIA, MASTERLY?

550
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,901
MASTERLY.

551
00:39:17,968 --> 00:39:20,100
Atia:
MAGNUS, TELL ME SOMETHING,
AND BE HONEST.

552
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:22,001
DOES MY DAUGHTER
PLEASE YOU?

553
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,001
VERYASING,
NO DOUBT.

554
00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:26,801
THEN I CAN TELL YOU
THAT CAESAR,

555
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:28,968
AS A TOKEN
OF HIS ABIDING FRIENDSHIP,

556
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:32,100
WOULD LIKE TO OFFER HER
TO YOU IN MARRIAGE.

557
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:35,233
AH. AHEM.

558
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,368
SHE IS NOT MARRIED
TO YOUNG GLABIUS?

559
00:39:40,434 --> 00:39:42,600
DIVORCED.

560
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:44,700
AH.

561
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:47,434
- PERHAPS YOU NEED
TIME TO THINK.
- EXCUSE ME,

562
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,434
I WAS TAKEN UNAWARES.

563
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,700
HOW COULD I REFUSE SUCH
A WORTHY AND DIGNIFIED BRIDE?

564
00:39:55,067 --> 00:39:58,200
- CAESAR IS
FAR TOO GENEROUS.
- EXCELLENT.

565
00:39:58,267 --> 00:40:00,501
WE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL NEXT MONTH

566
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,467
FOR AN ACTUAL CEREMONY,
OF COURSE,

567
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:04,833
WHEN JULIA'S
MOURNING DAYS ARE OVER.

568
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,034
OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
BUT YOU MAY TAKE

569
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,668
YOUR BETROTHAL PRIVILEGES
ANY TIME YOU WISH.

570
00:40:12,334 --> 00:40:13,767
NOW, IF YOU LIKE.

571
00:40:15,434 --> 00:40:18,467
- REALLY, THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.
- DON'T BE SILLY.

572
00:40:18,534 --> 00:40:21,200
OCTAVIA WOULD LOVE TO.

573
00:40:21,267 --> 00:40:23,534
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR SHYNESS.

574
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:26,667
WE'RE ALL FAMILY NOW,
AFTER ALL.

575
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:56,400
BRITISH WOMEN--
NOW, THAT'S SAVAGE CUNNY.

576
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:58,467
YOU HAVE TO HUNT THEM DOWN
LIKE DEER.

577
00:40:58,534 --> 00:41:00,300
MIND, ONCE YOU GET THEM
UNDER YOU,

578
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:02,167
SLACK AS YOUR BEST
NARBO SCORTUM.

579
00:41:02,234 --> 00:41:04,167
DO YOU CARE
FOR NOTHING BUT WOMEN?

580
00:41:04,234 --> 00:41:06,567
WHAT ELSE IS THERE?
FOOD, I SUPPOSE.

581
00:41:06,634 --> 00:41:08,300
YOU DON'T LIKE WOMEN?

582
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,367
OF COURSE I DO.

583
00:41:11,434 --> 00:41:13,200
I'M MARRIED TO ONE.

584
00:41:13,267 --> 00:41:16,467
- I HAVE A WIFE, NIOBE.
- I SEE. CENTURIONS CAN
MARRY THEN?

585
00:41:16,534 --> 00:41:18,200
I RECEIVED
A SPECIAL DISPENSATION.

586
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,767
A SPECIAL DISPENSATION?
SHE MUST BE SOME GOOD...

587
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:26,334
WOMAN.

588
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,167
SHE IS.

589
00:41:31,734 --> 00:41:33,968
BEEN AWHILE
SINCE YOU'VE SEEN HER THEN.

590
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,901
SEVEN YEARS,
140 DAYS.

591
00:41:36,968 --> 00:41:40,601
THAT'S HARD.
MAY FORTUNE SMILE ON YOU.

592
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,367
ME, I HAVE SIMPLER TASTES.

593
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:44,701
I LIKE TO KILL MY ENEMY,
TAKE THEIR GOLD

594
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:46,400
AND ENJOY THEIR WOMEN.

595
00:41:46,467 --> 00:41:49,267
THAT'S IT.
WHY TIE YOURSELF TO ONE?

596
00:41:49,334 --> 00:41:51,367
WHERE'S THE FLAVOR?
WHERE'S THE JOY?

597
00:41:51,434 --> 00:41:53,667
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU HAD A WOMAN

598
00:41:53,734 --> 00:41:55,834
WHO WASN'T CRYING
OR WANTING PAYMENT?

599
00:41:59,067 --> 00:42:01,734
YOU'RE ON FIRST WATCH.
WAKE ME WHEN THE MOON'S
AT THE ZENITH.

600
00:42:01,801 --> 00:42:04,100
( sighs )
RIGHT YOU ARE, SIR.

601
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:12,534
( horse whinnies )

602
00:42:12,601 --> 00:42:14,234
Vorenus:
HALT!

603
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:17,167
HALT!

604
00:42:22,634 --> 00:42:24,434
SONS OF DIS!

605
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:34,434
THEY WEREN'T
SUCH GOOD HORSES ANYWAY.

606
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:36,400
MY PEOPLE FOUGHT
AT ZAMA AND MAGNESIA,

607
00:42:36,467 --> 00:42:38,834
MY FATHER RODE WITH SULLA,
AND I'M REDUCED TO THIS--

608
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:41,033
UNHORSED AND ROBBED
BY CHILDREN.

609
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,167
( carts approaching )

610
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:49,501
( grunts )

611
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:52,934
NICE HORSE.

612
00:42:56,434 --> 00:42:58,868
- ( grunting )
- ( swords clanging )

613
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:18,467
LOOK HERE, MARS.
LOOK HERE, MARS.

614
00:43:18,534 --> 00:43:21,901
I AM TITUS PULLO.
THESOODYE BLEN ARE
MY GIFT TO YOU.

615
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,934
THANK E GODS YOU CAME.
I AM EXTREMELY GRATEFUL
TO YOU.

616
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,167
AYE!

617
00:43:30,667 --> 00:43:34,200
LISTEN TO ME. I ORDER YOU
TO RELEASE ME THIS INSTANT.

618
00:43:34,267 --> 00:43:37,300
FINE WAY FOR A SLAVE
TO TALK. YOU WON'T GET FAR
WITH A MOUTH ON YOU.

619
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:41,567
I'M NO SLAVE.
I'M GAIUS OCTAVIAN
OF THE JULII.

620
00:43:41,634 --> 00:43:43,901
- GREAT-NEPHEW
OF JULIUS CAESAR.
- GAIUS WHO?

621
00:43:43,968 --> 00:43:46,133
I AM A ROMAN CITIZEN
OF NOBLE BIRTH,

622
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,367
AND I ORDER YOU
TO CUT THESE ROPES.

623
00:43:48,434 --> 00:43:50,033
SAY PLEASE.

624
00:43:51,033 --> 00:43:52,133
PLEASE.

625
00:44:23,867 --> 00:44:26,068
BE ASSURED YOU WILL BE
AMPLY REWARDED

626
00:44:26,134 --> 00:44:28,168
FOR YOUR SERVICES TO ME.

627
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:30,034
SEE HOW GOOD HE TALKS?

628
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:32,068
HE'S CONVINCING,
I'LL GIVE HIM THAT.

629
00:44:32,134 --> 00:44:34,200
CAESAR WILL PROVE WHO I AM.
TAKE ME TO HIM.

630
00:44:34,267 --> 00:44:36,834
WE CANNOT DO THAT AS YET.
WE HAVE ORDERS.

631
00:44:36,901 --> 00:44:39,333
- WHAT ORDERS?
- WE ARE TO RETRIEVE
CAESAR'S STOLEN EAGLE.

632
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,168
CAESAR WOULDN'T PULL
A HAIR FOR HIS EAGLE.

633
00:44:41,233 --> 00:44:42,767
YOU'RE ON A FOOL'S ERRAND.

634
00:44:42,834 --> 00:44:46,001
IF CAESAR DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT THE EAGLE, WHY DID
HE SEND US TO FIND IT?

635
00:44:46,068 --> 00:44:47,701
IT W LOOOULDSTRANGE
IF HE MADE NO EFFORTS.

636
00:44:47,767 --> 00:44:50,634
ACTUALLY, LOSING THE EAGLE
IS USEFUL TO CAESAR.

637
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:52,434
WHY WOULD THAT BE
USEFUL TO CAESAR?

638
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,034
BECAUSE POMPEY IS
NO DEEP PHILOSOPHER.

639
00:44:55,101 --> 00:44:57,300
HE WILL TAKE
A SYMBOLIC LOSS
FOR A REAL WEAKNESS.

640
00:44:57,367 --> 00:44:58,701
EXPLAIN.

641
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,600
CAESAR DOESN'T WANT
TO STRIKE THE FIRST BLOW
AGAINST AN OLD FRIEND,

642
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:06,600
SO HE WISHES TO LURE POMPEY
INTO ATTACKING HIM FIRST.

643
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:09,333
POMPEY WILL ONLY DO THIS
IF HE BELIEVES CAESAR IS WEAK.

644
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,934
NO. THEY'RE AS GOOD
AS BROTHERS, THOSE TWO.

645
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:15,168
WHEN JULIA DIED,
THE LAST TRUE BOND
BETWEEN THEM WAS CUT.

646
00:45:15,233 --> 00:45:18,267
CAESAR HAS TAKEN THE LOVE
OF THE COMMON PEOPLE
FROM POMPEY,

647
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:21,767
AND THAT WAS
HIS MOST PRIZED POSSESSION
A BATTLE IS INEVITABLE.

648
00:45:34,267 --> 00:45:35,967
PULLO.

649
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,900
BLUE SPANIARDS!

650
00:45:41,967 --> 00:45:43,267
( grunts )

651
00:45:55,967 --> 00:45:57,967
( soldiers cheering )

652
00:46:37,434 --> 00:46:39,534
GOOD MORNING, UNCLE!

653
00:46:41,601 --> 00:46:43,800
OCTAVIAN?

654
00:46:50,334 --> 00:46:53,467
ONE OF POMPEY'S MEN.
I MISJUDGED HIM.

655
00:46:53,501 --> 00:46:55,934
I THOUGHT
IT WOULD TAKE STRATEGY
TO TURN HIM AGAIME,NST

656
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,501
BUT HE MUST HAVE TURNED
THE MOMENT JULIA DIED.

657
00:46:58,568 --> 00:47:00,934
AND ALL THE WHILE
HE WAS DEFENDING YOU
IN THE SENATE.

658
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,568
- ( chuckles )
- HE HAS THE CUNNING
OF A SARDINE, POOR FOOL.

659
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,800
THE BATTLE BEGINS.

660
00:47:08,833 --> 00:47:10,967
ABOUT TIME.

661
00:47:27,733 --> 00:47:29,800
PORCA JUNO.

662
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:33,501
Caesar's voice:
"DEAREST POMPEY,

663
00:47:33,568 --> 00:47:36,401
I BELIE
THE ENCLOSED MAN
BELONGS TO YOU.

664
00:47:36,467 --> 00:47:38,833
A QUICK NOTE TO TELL YOU
I HAVE DECIDED TO WINTER

665
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:42,000
THE 13th LEGION
CLOSER TO HOME, AT RAVENNA,

666
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:46,401
SO I SHALL SOON HAVE
THE PLEASURE OF PAYING YOU
HOMAGE IN PERSON."

667
00:47:46,467 --> 00:47:48,501
- ( people cheering )
- ( flute playing )

668
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:56,568
( horn sounding )

669
00:48:16,934 --> 00:48:21,000
Pompey:
ALL OF YOU, THIS IS
MY NEW WIFE, CORNELIA.

670
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,668
MAYBE IF YOU'D
SUMMONED A LITTLE CHARM

671
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:33,700
INSTEAD OF MOPING ABOUT
LIKE SOME TORPID OLD SHE-COW,

672
00:48:33,767 --> 00:48:35,800
- THIS WOULD
NEVER HAVE HAPPENED.
- OH, MY DEAR!

673
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,401
( Octavia crying )

674
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,600
EVERYONE KNOWS
IT'S A POLITICAL
REPUDIATION ON ACCOUNT

675
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:55,167
POMPEY AND CAESAR
ARE ENEMIES NOW.

676
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,367
ONE ONLY HASO LO T
AT CORNELIA.

677
00:48:58,434 --> 00:49:00,568
POOR SAD CHICKEN,
PLUCKED AND BOILED.

678
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:02,834
( chuckles )

679
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,167
MAYBE GLABIUS
WILL TAKE ME BACK.

680
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:06,867
OH...

681
00:49:06,934 --> 00:49:09,467
WE ARE WELL RID OF HIM.

682
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:13,100
WE'RE GOING TO FIND YOU
SOMEBODY MUCH MORE WORTHWHILE
THAN GLABIUS.

683
00:49:13,167 --> 00:49:16,334
I'VE BEEN DISHONORED
AND SHAMED BEFORE
THE WHOLE CITY!

684
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,200
NONSENSE!

685
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,267
A GIRL FROM A GOODILY
CAN NEVER BE DISHONORED

686
00:49:20,467 --> 00:49:22,701
A VBYLAINOUS
LITTLE PLEB LIKE POMPEY!

687
00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:24,601
NO...

688
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:28,267
IT IS I WHO HAS BEEN MADE
TO LOOK FOOLISH.

689
00:49:28,334 --> 00:49:32,667
- IT IS I
WHO HAVE LOST FACE!
- I WANT HIM DEAD.

690
00:49:32,734 --> 00:49:34,300
I WANT HIM DEAD.

691
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,334
AND THAT YOU SHALL HAVE.

692
00:49:44,834 --> 00:49:47,634
POMPEY WILL
EAT SAND FOR THIS.

693
00:49:47,701 --> 00:49:50,033
( dramatic music
playing )

694
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:28,500
