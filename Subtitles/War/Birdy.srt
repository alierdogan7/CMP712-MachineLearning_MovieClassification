1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,600
She likes you.

2
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,600
You see, Melanie...

3
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,200
...she's every bit as pretty.

4
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
You've been very nice.

5
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,900
Now you can have what you want.

6
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,500
Hey, you!

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,200
Birdboy!

8
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,000
Mrs. Angelucci said them feathers
can give you asthma.

9
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,400
I've got a great idea.

10
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,600
Let's enlist.

11
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,200
Kids got to play, honey.

12
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,400
Go tell that to your son.

13
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,200
Birdy!

14
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,600
Are you all right?

15
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,200
Switch shifts on Thursday?

16
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,600
How come they didn't
change the bandages?

17
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,100
No, ma'am.
He's unavailable right now.

18
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,100
Can I have him call you?

19
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,200
That's Doctor Moore.

20
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,800
How long do I wear these things?

21
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,200
We'll take them off when you
get back from seeing your friend.

22
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,300
Then I'll see if you got
everything back in the right place.

23
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,600
Should be okay,
give or take an ear or two.

24
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,000
I think the graft is
going to be just fine, Al.

25
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,200
After a while it'll start itching,
but you can't scratch it.

26
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,000
This ought to hold you.

27
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,500
How do you feel?

28
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,900
Like the Invisible Man.

29
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,200
Come see me when you get back, okay?

30
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,600
Sure thing.

31
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,100
Don't worry.

32
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,600
Don't stare, honey.
It's rude.

33
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,400
Shit, Birdy.

34
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,400
The things you put me through.

35
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,200
They always said you were weird.
Even my kid brother.

36
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Do you remember the time
with the knife?

37
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,800
Jesus Christ!
These damn kids!

38
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,800
Way to go! Now we'll never
get it back. The lady's a witch.

39
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Stay out of my yard!

40
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,300
You hear?

41
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,300
We don't have another ball.
How else we going to play?

42
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,000
By not hitting it here.
Go somewhere else and play.

43
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,100
This ain't no ballpark.
This is my yard.

44
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,400
Why don't you do something about it?

45
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,100
Kids got to play, honey.

46
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,100
You tell that to your own boy.

47
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,300
I don't want to.

48
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,000
Come on, why not?

49
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
I just don't feel like it.

50
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,900
Sure you feel like it.

51
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,500
Well, if I let you...

52
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,600
...can I wear your letter jacket?

53
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,200
Yes.

54
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,400
Hey, Al.

55
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,800
-Al!
-What?

56
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,900
He's down the street.
The weird kid.

57
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,400
Later, Mario. Get lost.

58
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,700
Come on, you promised.

59
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,100
Hey, birdboy!

60
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,800
What's your name?

61
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,200
This is like talking to the air.

62
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,800
Got a knife I can borrow, kid?
Got a splinter.

63
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,200
This it, Mario?

64
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,900
Yeah, that's my knife.

65
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,000
You thief!
My brother says it's his.

66
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,200
Back off!
Don't mess with me!

67
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,900
Don't mess with my brother!

68
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,700
He's a wrestling champion!

69
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,600
Now you're in trouble!
This really better be your knife.

70
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,800
It is.
Ziegenfuss stole it from me.

71
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,800
I thought you said he stole it!

72
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,400
No! I just said he had it.

73
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,400
Jesus, Mario.

74
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I bought it from Ziegenfuss.
But if he stole it, you can have it.

75
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,000
Don't touch it.

76
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,400
-It's mine.
-We'll get you another.

77
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,600
Here.

78
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,300
Thanks.

79
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,000
Where'd you learn all that stuff?
You wrestle or something?

80
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
No.

81
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,100
You should.

82
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,400
You like pigeons?

83
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,400
What's to like?

84
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,800
They fly.

85
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,100
They fly. So what?

86
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,700
That's enough.

87
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,600
Come on, Al. Are we going, or what?

88
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,700
I'm training these
to be carrier pigeons.

89
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,400
You mean with the notes,
like in a war?

90
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,400
I got a class. I've got to go.

91
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
So go.

92
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,000
Up yours!

93
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,300
Pretty ugly birds.

94
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,200
You know, if he really can train
them to carry notes, I'd buy one.

95
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,400
-You would?
-Sure. A lot of kids would.

96
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,400
Wait a minute!

97
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,800
How about if I help you catch some?

98
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,300
It's funny how they do that.

99
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,700
If it hadn't happened every
five minutes for the last 50 years....

100
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,800
Dumb.

101
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,500
They always come back
to the same place.

102
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
See?

103
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,800
Same exact spot every time, and just
carry on with their business.

104
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,800
-Come on.
-Where you going?

105
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Higher.

106
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,900
-We got to get up to talk to them.
-Are you kidding?

107
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,600
Are we allowed up here?

108
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,400
Looks awful high to me.

109
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,500
Fuck you!

110
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,800
It worked!

111
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,000
Birdy, where are you?

112
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,000
Very funny.
Now where the fuck are you?

113
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,400
Come the hell out.
I know you're in here, birdbrain.

114
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,500
What's that?

115
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,800
A pigeon suit I'm making for you.

116
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
This way, they'll think
you're one of them.

117
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,600
I don't want them to think
I'm one of them.

118
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,900
Come on, just try it.

119
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,200
No way would I be caught dead in that.

120
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,600
I feel ridiculous.

121
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,200
You look terrific.

122
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,300
Come on.

123
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,800
It's over here.

124
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,400
I want to go change.
I look stupid!

125
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,300
Not to a bird, Al.

126
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,300
That's some view.

127
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,600
Can you see the Tower Theatre?

128
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,200
That must be City Hall over there.

129
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,600
Stars, Al.

130
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,600
Look at the stars.

131
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,700
What stars?

132
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
We should come back
to just look at them.

133
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,200
What are you doing?
For chrissakes, get down!

134
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,300
Hold my legs, will you, Al?

135
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,400
You'll like this one, Al.

136
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,000
She looks like your dad.

137
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,400
I got to get a little lower.

138
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,800
Let me down a bit more.

139
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,200
Jesus, Birdy!

140
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,000
Give me a bag.

141
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,100
Fuck!

142
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,600
No! Birdy!

143
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,200
Hold on, I'll get help.

144
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,700
I can't hold on that long.

145
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,600
What's so funny?

146
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,200
You.

147
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,300
You look so serious.

148
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,100
It is fucking serious!

149
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,200
Shit!

150
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Look, this isn't going to work.

151
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,500
I'll try to make it to the sand pile.

152
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,600
-What are you talking about?
-It's easy.

153
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,800
You'll jump?

154
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,800
No, Al, I'm going to fly.

155
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,900
Don't jump!

156
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,300
Let go!

157
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,100
Birdy, are you all right?

158
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,500
Birdy, are you all right?

159
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I flew, Al.

160
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,400
Sure, you flew.

161
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,000
It was beautiful.

162
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,800
It was like....

163
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,800
You look awful pale, Birdy.

164
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,400
Should I go get somebody?

165
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,000
You might have busted something inside.

166
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,000
You'll break your crazy neck
one of these days.

167
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,600
God, Birdy!
Don't do anything like that again.

168
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,300
What do you think, sergeant?

169
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Sir?

170
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,000
Your friend.

171
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,100
How does he look to you?

172
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,300
It's hard to say.
I'm not sure I understand your question.

173
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,900
It's a simple question.

174
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,800
How does your friend look?

175
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,300
Are you his doctor?

176
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,500
Why are you asking me?

177
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,200
Obviously, because I want to hear
what you have to say.

178
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,500
He doesn't look good.
Does he just sit there like that?

179
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,200
For the most part.

180
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,800
Was he wounded?

181
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,700
Yes, but his wounds
were relatively minor.

182
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,000
This is not a physiological condition.

183
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,800
Then how'd he get like this?

184
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,400
All we know is that he was
missing in action for a month.

185
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,800
For a while, we didn't even
know who he was.

186
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,300
Does he know who he is?

187
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,700
I don't know.

188
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
He hasn't talked since he was found.

189
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,000
So you really don't know anything.

190
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,100
I think I know a few things, sergeant.

191
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,500
It was my idea to bring you here.

192
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,800
Why am I here?

193
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,300
The patient's mother
thought you might be...

194
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,400
...well, of some help.

195
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,100
Frankly, I'm willing to try anything.

196
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,900
-And I'm it?
-For now.

197
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,100
When I found out about
your condition....

198
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,400
It seems like it might be
an interesting therapy.

199
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,200
For him or for me?

200
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,100
I hope for both of you.

201
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,000
Come with me.
There's something I want you to see.

202
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,000
No, tuna salad, not chicken salad.

203
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,800
Lots of mayonnaise and none of those
little celery chunks.

204
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Two of them.

205
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,400
Do you want anything?

206
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,300
Coffee?

207
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,900
Two coffees, cream and sugar.

208
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,300
Okay, yeah, that's it.

209
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,600
Strange, huh?

210
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,700
Jumping and twisting,
like he was trying to escape.

211
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,700
You sure can't blame him for that.

212
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,800
No one is, sergeant.

213
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,100
He wouldn't like being cooped up here.

214
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,400
What do you suppose impels him
into these strange positions?

215
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,900
Like what?

216
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,100
Like this...

217
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,100
...cringing position.

218
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,800
Was there any psychological trouble
before he was in the military?

219
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,200
How close were you?

220
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,100
We was real good buddies.
Pretty close.

221
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,200
Very close?

222
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,500
We weren't queer for one another
or anything like that.

223
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,800
We were normal, crazy Philly kids.

224
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,800
How crazy?

225
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,600
You ever been to Philly, sir?

226
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,400
You have to be pretty crazy
to live there.

227
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,800
I don't understand yet
what's brought him to this.

228
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,100
You got any ideas?

229
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,600
He got drafted.

230
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
All wars have
their casualties, sergeant...

231
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,900
...and the Army takes care
of their own.

232
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,000
Certainly took care of me, doctor.

233
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,100
Major, sergeant.

234
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,000
Major, sir.

235
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,300
I know that this is difficult
for you at this time.

236
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,700
And I know it's hard for you
to come here like this.

237
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,500
How does your face feel?

238
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,700
It's okay.

239
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,000
No problems?

240
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,000
The bandages are a little hard
to get used to, sir.

241
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,600
When the doctor--
The major...

242
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,600
...said one of the things they
had to do was give me a steel jaw...

243
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,200
...I thought, "Great!
A steel jaw!

244
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
Maybe I'll be the next La Motta."

245
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,200
Turns out, a punch could knock
the pins into my brain...

246
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,200
...so it's worse than a glass jaw.

247
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,000
It's pretty funny, huh?

248
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,000
A lot of people wouldn't think so.
Aren't you concerned?

249
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,200
Sure, kind of.

250
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
You know what would be
a good idea, Alfonso?

251
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,300
-Al.
-It might be helpful...

252
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
...if you visited your friend now.

253
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,100
It's important that
I make some progress soon.

254
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,200
Ronsky? Send Renaldi in here.

255
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,600
You'll like Renaldi, Alfonso.
He's Italian too.

256
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,400
What's going on here?

257
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,300
Occupational therapy.
Some genius at Boeing thought it up.

258
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,000
Who better to sort out
the nuts than nuts, right?

259
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,600
-What do you do here?
-Pretty much everything.

260
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,800
Mostly I help take care
of the patients.

261
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,400
I take them for walks,
read them the funnies...

262
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,700
...blow their noses,
change the bedpans...

263
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,300
...wheel them into the TV room.
Stuff like that.

264
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,100
How'd you get that shitty job?
They bust you?

265
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,900
I'm a conscientious objector.

266
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,400
You're kidding.

267
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,100
An Italian conscientious objector?

268
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,600
That's right.

269
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
Hi, Ned. Nice day.

270
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,300
Ned's elevator doesn't go
up to the top floor.

271
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,900
Combat stress. He's quiet today.

272
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,800
Normally, he's throwing shit
against the walls.

273
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,200
Here he is.

274
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,700
I'll be back soon, and
I'll take you to your bunk.

275
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,500
They have you in with me.

276
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,700
Take it easy.

277
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,500
Hey, Birdy.

278
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,200
Is this for real, or what?

279
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,300
If this is some act you cooked up to
get out of Nam, it worked.

280
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,200
You can stop now.

281
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,600
Come on, Birdy.

282
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,500
It's me under all these bandages.

283
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,000
It's Al.

284
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,300
Maybe I'll get into
something crazy myself.

285
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,700
Can't you see it?

286
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,100
"Neighbourhood Boy Turned a Lunatic
by the Horrors of War."

287
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,200
All I'd have to do
for a pension is growl...

288
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,000
...or go beat somebody up
on Market Street.

289
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,800
So much for that.

290
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,600
God, this place gives me the creeps.

291
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,400
It's awful quiet for a loony bin.

292
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,300
You know, they keep saying
I'll be fine.

293
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,900
I keep hearing them.

294
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,000
"Quit worrying how you look,
Columbato."

295
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,300
But I saw a guy at Dix
who they also said would be fine.

296
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,100
And he had a face like
a medium-rare cheeseburger.

297
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,800
I'm scared I won't recognize
who I'm shaving in the morning.

298
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,600
Jesus, Birdy, what happened to you?

299
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,400
That fat-gut shrink,
he wants me to jog up your brain...

300
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,800
...by getting you to remember
the things we did together.

301
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,900
Did we jack one another off?
Stuff like that.

302
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,200
I don't trust that guy.

303
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,200
Everything's too interesting to him.

304
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,000
So what do you want to talk about?

305
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Maybe we should talk about
one of the 85 million times...

306
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,200
...we tried to find where your mother
hid the goddamn baseballs.

307
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,400
Okay, you don't like that one.

308
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,200
Remember that statue of Billy Penn
on top of City Hall?

309
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,900
How, from certain angles,
it looked like he had a hard-on?

310
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,400
And how we used to stand there
with the pigeons?

311
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,800
Every time some old lady would walk by,
we'd point at Billy Penn.

312
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,300
They'd look up, and they'd see
Billy with his dong sticking up.

313
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,900
Shit!

314
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,800
Do you need a hand?

315
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,700
What are you doing here?

316
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,800
I'm his friend.
The doctor brought me.

317
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Right!

318
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,500
Now I remember.

319
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,100
-What's your name?
-Columbato, Al.

320
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,200
You know, I'm not in the Army.

321
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,200
You can tell me your name
frontways if you want to.

322
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,600
I'm Hannah.

323
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,500
He eats that?

324
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,600
Looks horrible, doesn't it?
It's all he'll let me feed him.

325
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,400
You have to feed him?

326
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,300
Can't he feed himself?

327
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,000
I don't know.

328
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,600
He doesn't.

329
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,800
He won't let the orderlies feed him.

330
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,400
For some reason, he lets me.

331
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,000
Shit, maybe I'll stop talking.

332
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,500
I like your friend.

333
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,100
But I wish he wouldn't do this.

334
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,600
Listen, I'm going to go.

335
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,500
You can stay if you want.

336
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,200
That's all right.
I'll go bunk out for a while.

337
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,600
Okay, hang on. I'll unlock you.

338
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,400
Hi there.
Let me take a look at your back.

339
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,000
Tell me where it hurts.

340
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,200
My buddy's broken his leg.

341
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,000
Maybe his back.

342
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,700
I hope not his back,
because that can make you crazy.

343
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,100
He's a little crazy.
He thinks he can fly.

344
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,300
He thinks he's a bird.

345
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,300
It's all here, the whole thing,
how he fell off the gas tank.

346
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,900
There's a picture showing where he
jumped and an "X" where he landed!

347
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,900
I don't want to hear any more!
Not birds, not nothing!

348
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,700
You can start now...

349
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,600
...by cleaning the pigeon shit
off the front porch.

350
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,200
Face it, we're out of
the pigeon business.

351
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,400
-They ain't coming back.
-They'll come back, they were homed.

352
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,300
What kind of home is it when
your witch of a mom chops it up...

353
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,300
...and chases the birds away?

354
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,700
It's home to them.

355
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,200
It's not the lumber and nails.
It's the place.

356
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,400
I got to tell you something.

357
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,800
But you have to promise
not to go ape-shit on me.

358
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,900
What?

359
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,400
Do you promise?

360
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,400
You're right.
Those birds kept coming back.

361
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,000
Your mom puts down poison
and knocks off half of them.

362
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,300
But those blue bars get smart
and still keep coming back.

363
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,300
So she calls Mr. Solari.

364
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,300
Mr. Solari, the poultry guy?

365
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
Yeah, the butcher.

366
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,200
That guy would dress his mother
as a chicken...

367
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,100
...if he got 69 cents a pound.

368
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,900
He must've taken them.
They ain't been back since.

369
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,700
No, you don't get it, Al.

370
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,400
Those blue bars saw Solari.

371
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,400
That's why they didn't come back.

372
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,400
You're wrong!
Solari bagged them.

373
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,300
They're dead!
Plucked and fucked!

374
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,000
You don't understand birds, Al.

375
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,400
I got an idea for something else
we can go partners on.

376
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,800
You know that old Ford
at the junkyard?

377
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,400
Yeah, okay.

378
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,500
It's a good thing those blue bars
recognized Solari, huh?

379
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,600
Pigeons ain't stupid, Al!

380
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,200
Remember that statue
of Billy Penn on top of City Hall?

381
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,800
How, from certain angles,
it looked like he had a hard-on?

382
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,100
If I'm going to learn,
I'll have to watch them closer.

383
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,300
Be there when they fly.

384
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,500
I want them to be
as free as possible.

385
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,500
Nobody wants to be in a cage.

386
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,800
How are you doing back there?

387
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,500
-You okay?
-Yeah, just great.

388
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,200
That is some piece of shit.

389
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,900
Does it go?

390
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,000
Not yet.

391
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,100
But it will.

392
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,800
-How'd it get here?
-We pushed it.

393
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,400
-It's a piece of shit.
-Thank you.

394
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,200
Don't use any of my tools.

395
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,000
No, sir.

396
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,000
You'll have to register that
before you sell it.

397
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,700
How, Mr. Columbato?

398
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,600
You wait till you're old enough.

399
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,800
-Maybe I'll do it for you.
-That'd be great, Dad.

400
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,600
Fucking garbageman!

401
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,700
Come on, sister!

402
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,400
All right.

403
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,400
Well, now!

404
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,400
Top down!

405
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,100
There she goes!

406
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,400
We're doing 80 on the expressway.

407
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,300
Look for 76 and the Walt Whitman.
Watch out for cops.

408
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,000
We need quarters for the toll.

409
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,800
No, I'll drive straight through.

410
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,000
It's not my fault you left
the gate down!

411
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,300
Yeah, you too, motherfucker!

412
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,500
Watch out!

413
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,600
That was a close one.

414
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,200
Tailspin.

415
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,700
We're just driving.

416
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,300
Where we going?

417
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,200
Where else? The ocean.

418
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,100
I've never been there.

419
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,300
You're kidding.

420
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,700
This is great!
It's like flying in thick air!

421
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:59,400
Are we going to go see the boardwalk
and pick up some chicks?

422
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,400
Okay, just one more time,
all right? You ready?

423
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
On your mark.

424
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,000
Goddamn it!

425
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,400
One Mississippi, two Mississippi...

426
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,800
...three Mississippi,
four Mississippi...

427
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,500
...five Mississippi....

428
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Ten Mississippi, Birdy!

429
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,800
Thirteen Mississippi.

430
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,900
It's a 15 Mississippi, Birdy!

431
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,900
Sixteen Mississippi!

432
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,800
I don't know how to swim!

433
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,100
Now don't go do
anything stupid, Birdy.

434
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,200
I know what's in that
goddamned fool mind of yours.

435
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,200
Right down here, on this
same street, they got this ride....

436
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,200
Expectant mothers, the young...

437
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,800
...go see the greatest attraction
in the world today.

438
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,300
See Apasha, the Gorilla Girl.

439
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,100
See her change from a woman
to an ape. A gorilla!

440
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,700
It's gross!

441
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
-Horrible!
-Was he born like this?

442
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
No way, it's a gyp.
His legs are stuck.

443
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,600
-It's a false bottom.
-Isn't it amazing?

444
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,700
Introducing Zimmy, the human fish.

445
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,200
Folks, let's hear it for Zimmy.

446
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,800
-How does he do it?
-Does what?

447
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,500
Hold his breath so long.
I have to keep coming up for air.

448
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,400
We've been here four minutes.
He hasn't come up for air.

449
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,300
Think he has a wife?

450
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,600
You okay?

451
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,500
I can hold my breath
for two minutes, 40 seconds now.

452
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,600
Do you want to try?

453
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,800
You play sports?

454
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,200
Of course not.

455
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
AI and I throw the discus sometimes.

456
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,600
So you play on a team?

457
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,000
We just throw it
to see how far it'll go.

458
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,200
AI used to be on a team.

459
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,500
He used to be a wrestling champ.

460
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,600
Are you guys finished yet?

461
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm leaving!

462
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,100
I ain't hanging around with
that creep no more!

463
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,000
Why do you always do this?

464
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,200
You stuck me with--

465
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,600
Shut up!

466
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,800
What are you going to do now?

467
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,200
Fuck it!

468
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,500
What?

469
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,500
You have got to learn...

470
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,900
...to be more sociable!

471
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,000
I don't think she liked me.

472
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,000
You got to make them like you.

473
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,600
Talk like you're interested
in all that crap they go on about.

474
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,400
You just got to talk more.

475
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,000
I don't care about what,
as long as it's not flying and birds!

476
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,400
What if that's what
I'm really thinking about?

477
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,600
That's the first thing you got to
understand in your dealings with women.

478
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,700
Never let them know
what you're thinking.

479
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,000
I'm not thinking about them.

480
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,300
Then just lie, for God sakes!

481
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,200
You're the best
goddamn liar I ever met.

482
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,400
Don't you know your chick
had great jugs on her?

483
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,100
I don't understand.
What's the big deal?

484
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,400
-They're just overgrown mammary glands.
-Mammary glands?

485
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,300
Mammary glands?

486
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,200
We're talking tits here!

487
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,500
Big tits!

488
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,100
Round tits.

489
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,200
Fleshy tits.

490
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,900
-Just a lot of dumb development to me.
-Full tits.

491
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,000
Women carry them around
their whole lives.

492
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,100
-Flopping around, getting in the way.
-They don't get in the way.

493
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,200
They're needed.
They're necessary.

494
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,200
I seen a picture in
National Geographic.

495
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,500
Just like on a cow,
but in a more stupid place.

496
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,200
It's not like a cow at all.

497
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,900
I'm telling you for your own good.

498
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,900
You don't know what you're missing.

499
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,800
That girl, Shirley...

500
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
...I didn't even have to ask her.

501
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,800
She just lifted her shirt
and put my hand under it.

502
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,300
And then she undoes her bra for me.

503
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,300
I start feeling the whole tit,
nipple and all.

504
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,000
She's poking her tongue down my throat.

505
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,900
And then, I'm reaching down
with my hand.

506
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,700
I'm working my way down.
She's work--

507
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,600
-That your '53 Ford back there?
-Sure, why?

508
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,900
Could you stop walking around?
You make me nervous.

509
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,400
I cannot stand this much longer.

510
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,100
I hope your old man comes soon.

511
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,200
Well, I don't.

512
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,600
Hi, Dad.

513
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,500
Hi, Mom.

514
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,300
Ever wonder what our lives down here
must seem like to a bird?

515
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,100
You two shut up!

516
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,100
Fucking fuck!
I'm always fucked!

517
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,900
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

518
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,400
Hi, Al. How are you?

519
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,200
I'm pretty good, Birdy, thanks.

520
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,100
You know, Al...

521
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,800
...I'm glad you came to see me.

522
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,700
We haven't seen each other
in a while...

523
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,200
...and there's a lot of water
under the bridge.

524
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,400
But it's good just to sit here
and not talk with you.

525
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,900
Yeah, it's a real blast.
But, you know....

526
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,100
Come on, Birdy!

527
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,500
Talk to me.

528
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Okay, don't talk to me.

529
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,100
You think I don't know
what you're doing...

530
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,300
...with this squatting
and sideways staring stuff?

531
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,200
So you're finally a bird.
Big deal!

532
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,800
If Weiss finds out, he'll put
you in a display case...

533
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,800
...and write papers on you forever.

534
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,500
Damn cats are driving me crazy!

535
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,800
I'll get a BB gun and pop them off.

536
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,800
They'll give the birds a heart attack,
scaring them all day.

537
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Let's get this door closed
so they don't get out here.

538
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,600
That's it.

539
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,400
You know my mother.

540
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,500
And that's Mr. Tate.

541
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,600
He's deaf.
He doesn't hear anything.

542
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,900
He loves the birds singing,
like Beethoven.

543
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,300
I said you're like Beethoven.

544
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,100
You like that one, huh?

545
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,400
She's a good-looker, all right.

546
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,700
But don't go for flyers when
you're looking for a good breeder.

547
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,100
Come on, honey.

548
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Come here.

549
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,300
Don't you want to eat?

550
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,800
She's a pretty one,
but won't notice any of the daddies.

551
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,200
She's a heartbreaker.
So particular!

552
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,700
Rhett and Ashley can't get near her.

553
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
It sure ain't like in the movie.

554
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,100
I don't let them mate
more than one at a time.

555
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,800
No brothers and sisters.

556
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,400
It ain't right.
Says so in the Bible.

557
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,500
Mr. Tate...

558
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,900
...lets them all in together,
like a Roman orgy.

559
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,600
Ain't natural.

560
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,000
Here's Melanie.

561
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,800
Come here, Melanie.

562
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,400
The first day I saw Perta...

563
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,100
...I knew she was special.

564
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,300
The way she took to the air...

565
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,200
...like it was hers.

566
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,000
She likes you.

567
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,400
Don't get taken in
'cause she's a flyer.

568
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,400
Melanie here, she's a darling bird.
Every bit as pretty.

569
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,500
No, I'll take this one.

570
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,400
You can't do anything about it.

571
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,700
He sold it before he ever
told me about it.

572
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,200
At least we got
what we paid for the car.

573
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,400
I'll give you my share.
We can use it for your ornithopter.

574
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,000
I don't care about the money.

575
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,400
It's the principle of the thing.

576
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,600
The only principle is my old man
does whatever he wants.

577
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,600
Do you want me to pin him?
I wish I could, but I can't!

578
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:18,900
We're going to get it back.

579
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,800
Are you crazy? Suicidal?
He doesn't even like you.

580
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,200
He'll break your neck.

581
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,400
I don't care.

582
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,600
It's our car.

583
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,800
You can't do this.
You know what he's like.

584
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,200
I tell you, he'll kill you!

585
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,700
Jesus, sometimes you're
so full of shit!

586
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,900
All right, but you're on your own.

587
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,600
I'm not going with you.

588
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,400
I don't want blood
splattered all over me.

589
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,000
Shit!

590
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
-I want the car back.
-What do you mean?

591
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,900
-You got your money!
-You had no right to sell it!

592
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,600
It's worth more than the money!

593
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,800
It belongs to us.
We didn't want to--!

594
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,100
That car was in my name.
I'll sell it to whoever.

595
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,300
Would you get out of here?
I'm trying to read my paper.

596
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,400
Tell me the man's name
who thinks he bought it--!

597
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,400
Get out of here. I'll call the cops!

598
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,200
I was about to do that myself!
I'd like to report a stolen car!

599
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,000
Are you calling me
a crook in my own house?!

600
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,700
Are you crazy?!

601
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,300
Are you trying to say
I stole that junk heap?!

602
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,000
Don't embarrass me
in front of my family!

603
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,200
You sold something that wasn't yours!

604
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,800
Give me the man's name
who thinks he bought it!

605
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,200
I'll tell him you made a mistake!

606
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,200
I sold the car to a friend
of my brother-in-law!

607
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,100
This guy is not
giving you the car back!

608
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:33,800
You mess around with him and you'll
wind up in a concrete shirt...

609
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,300
...at the bottom of the river!

610
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,300
I don't want to go to the police...

611
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,200
...but I got a receipt of purchase
from Mr. Russo...

612
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,500
...at the junkyard!

613
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,300
You think it's yours
because you registered it for us.

614
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,800
It's legally ours because
you don't got no proof-of-purchase!

615
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Why do you want to be a hard-nose for?

616
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,000
I can't get you the car back...

617
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,800
-...even if I wanted to!
-So tell me his name!

618
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,000
Shut up, you skinny bucket of piss!

619
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,400
You're not worth going
to jail for, for murder.

620
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,500
Here's what I'll do.

621
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,400
-Here's the money.
-I don't want it.

622
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,700
-That's all I got--
-It wasn't yours to sell!

623
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,000
Shut the fuck up!

624
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,100
He's going to take it.

625
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,400
Read your paper, honey. Please.
He'll take the money.

626
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,000
You'll take the money.

627
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,600
I'll get you more from
my brother if you want.

628
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,200
Don't make no trouble.
Please!

629
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,400
Here.
I don't want it.

630
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,800
Half of it's yours.
You deserve it.

631
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,500
It was our car, Al.

632
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,700
I could never stand up
to my old man like that.

633
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,400
Maybe life is shitty.

634
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,900
It is shitty.

635
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,400
I'll tell you something.

636
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,300
I'm not trying to pin life anymore.

637
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,100
I don't even fucking understand it.

638
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,400
I just want to make it through with
some dignity, like everybody else.

639
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,400
Of course, if there was any real
dignity, there wouldn't be any sex.

640
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,100
I'm going to go now, all right?

641
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,200
All right?

642
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,600
But I'll be back.

643
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,000
Renaldi!

644
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,800
Let me out! Let me out!
Let me out!

645
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,800
You okay, Al?

646
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,200
You were moaning as if in pain.
Is your face bothering you?

647
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,900
-You won't tell anyone about this?
-No, of course not.

648
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,600
No, sir, not yet.

649
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,600
Yeah, he's here right now.

650
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,500
His file came in this morning.

651
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,200
Would you come over here, please?

652
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:20,000
Is your serial number
10107003 or 10107008?

653
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,100
It's 003. Why?

654
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,500
I want to get it right.

655
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,100
It's C-O-L-U-M-B-A-T-O,
Sergeant Alfonso?

656
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,100
What is this?
Am I being taken prisoner?

657
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,800
The major wants some more
information on you.

658
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,800
What do you got, my file?

659
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,500
Everything about you.

660
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,700
There we go.

661
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,300
Is there any history of insanity
in your family?

662
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,800
No.

663
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,100
Why are you asking me?

664
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,600
Suicides?

665
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,700
What?

666
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:13,800
Any suicides?

667
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,400
Not yet.

668
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,100
Finish that later.
Bring me what you've got.

669
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,600
Come on in.

670
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,300
Excuse me, Major.

671
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,500
Is something wrong
with your secretary?

672
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:42,800
Oh, you mean the spitting.

673
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,200
Ever since combat,
he's had a bad taste in his mouth.

674
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,700
Don't worry. We're working on him.
Have a seat.

675
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,300
Why was he asking me
all those questions?

676
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:57,900
I'm not a patient here.

677
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,300
I like to know who I'm dealing with.

678
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,300
How do you think
the Army's treated you?

679
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,500
Not bad. Okay, I guess.

680
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,800
It says you attacked
a superior officer...

681
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,800
...just after you arrived in Saigon.

682
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,000
We were in a bar.

683
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,100
I just hit him.

684
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,400
You knocked out four teeth
and broke his nose.

685
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,500
I hit him hard.
He was dogging me.

686
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,400
-You think you might have overreacted?
-Maybe.

687
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,700
Sir, we all make mistakes.

688
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,700
But it's important to learn
from our mistakes. Don't you think?

689
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,900
Shouldn't we be talking
about the patient here?

690
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,800
Whose idea was it to steal that car?
Yours or his?

691
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,300
Steal a car?

692
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,500
I believe it was in Atlantic City.

693
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,000
Oh, that!

694
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,700
That was a misunderstanding.

695
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,200
My father had it registered
in his name.

696
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,600
We were having a good time, you know.

697
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,500
Is that how your father saw it?

698
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,500
No, not exactly.

699
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,100
What did he do?

700
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,500
He took away my allowance.

701
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:58,800
Listen, you wise guy.

702
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,800
I've got better things to do
than play games with you!

703
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,600
I should probably
send you back.

704
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,300
You don't have to do that, sir.

705
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,400
Maybe you haven't noticed...

706
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,100
...what happens to men like your friend,
without special attention.

707
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,800
What do you mean?

708
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,800
They stay here for
the rest of their lives.

709
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
They rot.
Sometimes they just die.

710
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:21,400
I'm sure I can get through to him.
I just need some more time.

711
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,400
All right, sergeant.

712
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,700
This is not an
indefinite stay for you.

713
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,200
You can go.

714
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,900
One more thing.

715
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,000
Did you or your friend
resent your father...

716
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,400
...for that misunderstanding
about the car?

717
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,200
No, sir.

718
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,700
We both really liked my father.

719
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,700
He was a heck of a guy.

720
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,000
Not so bad, right?

721
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,500
Oh, shit! I should be done
with him by now.

722
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,900
Would you feed him
while I go finish up?

723
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,100
-Sure.
-Thanks.

724
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,300
Take this.

725
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,800
I'll be right back.

726
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,900
I saw that cockeyed look of yours.

727
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,100
That look always means something.

728
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,600
You think I was hitting on her,
don't you?

729
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,700
You think maybe she likes me?

730
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,400
You really got to quit it
with this crap.

731
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,800
I got to get out of here.

732
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,100
That shrink gives me the eye
like I'm crazy.

733
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,600
It's not a great feeling.

734
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:52,000
Not that it ever
seemed to bother you.

735
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,800
Come on, Birdy, eat it.

736
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,200
If you could see yourself
squatting here...

737
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,800
...and me shovelling
this crap down your throat...

738
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,100
...you'd probably laugh
yourself to death.

739
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,400
What?

740
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,200
I won't have another
talking-to-the-wall conversation.

741
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,200
Decide if you're listening or not.

742
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,500
We'll do it your way.

743
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,100
We'll sit here and commune
like goddamn birds.

744
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,200
Hey, pretty.

745
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,700
Come here.

746
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,200
How do you do that?

747
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,400
Your mother said enough for tonight.
It's almost 3 o'clock.

748
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,200
I'm working on my ornithop--

749
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,900
Come on, enough's enough!
We're supposed to be asleep!

750
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,000
Tell him.
You're his father.

751
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,400
Come on, son.

752
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,200
Leave the bird alone.

753
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,700
Then the bird's feather.

754
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,600
It has a hollow shaft, with
feeders for blood circulation.

755
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,400
On either side are branches, barbs...

756
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,600
...which branch into barbules...

757
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,700
...which have little barbicels
with hooks on the end of them.

758
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:35,800
It can all be pulled apart,
like a zipper.

759
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,000
And then re-zipped.

760
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,400
A bird runs its beak
through its feather...

761
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,000
...re-zipping feathers
that have come apart.

762
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,500
Flying is much more than flapping wings.

763
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,000
A bird can flap its wings
and not move an inch.

764
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,600
When it wants to fly...

765
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,900
...the slightest flicker
sends it up to the sky.

766
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:59,300
You must feel that air has substance
and can hold you up.

767
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,600
It's mostly a matter of confidence.

768
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,900
Fuck them.
What do they know, anyway?

769
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,100
Did you notice Doris Robinson
giving you the eye?

770
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,800
She must be hot for
mad-scientist types.

771
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,400
-You ought to ask her out.
-I don't think so.

772
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,300
I can't afford to take her out.

773
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,300
It doesn't cost anything.

774
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,000
You think Cheryl's charging me for it?

775
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,400
I'll go to the cafeteria.
You want to come?

776
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,200
I want to go down and talk to my dad.

777
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:52,800
Dad?

778
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,800
Dad!

779
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
I'm in here.

780
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:00,800
Come on in.

781
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,200
You had lunch yet?

782
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,600
-I'm not hungry.
-You got to eat.

783
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,800
Grab a sandwich and sit down.

784
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:13,600
Dad...

785
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,300
...I want to ask you a question.

786
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,100
Shoot.

787
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,900
I want another canary,
a male for mating.

788
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,800
Maybe you can talk to Mom.

789
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,400
I don't know.
We don't want to antagonize her.

790
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,100
I had a heck of a time getting her
to let you build the aviary.

791
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:29,800
She's worried...

792
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,000
...about what it's costing
for the feed...

793
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,600
...the lumber and whatnot.

794
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,400
The birdseed's cheap.

795
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,600
-AI and I swipe the lumber.
-I sure won't tell her that.

796
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,000
She's convinced
your friend is AI Capone.

797
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,200
I know.

798
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,500
Don't think your mom
doesn't want what's best.

799
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:48,200
She's concerned that you develop
interests and friends...

800
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,400
...that'll help you fit in.

801
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,100
Fit into what?

802
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,200
Whatever. You know, life.

803
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:57,000
She thinks I won't fit
in with AI and a canary?

804
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,100
It's not that.
It's just, well....

805
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,600
Take me.

806
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,300
I've always had an interest in wicker.

807
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,900
When I met your mom,
I could make a better wicker chair...

808
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,200
...than any man in Philadelphia.

809
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,800
I still could, if anybody wanted one.

810
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,600
But nobody cares about wicker anymore.

811
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,200
So I don't fit into
the scheme of things.

812
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,800
You see what I'm saying?

813
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:21,800
Your mother just wants you
to wind up better than me.

814
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,300
Every parent wants that.

815
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:29,500
I'm just saying you should be
interested in something practical too.

816
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,500
It's hard to be good
at something nobody wants, huh?

817
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,700
You really want this, don't you?

818
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,800
I'll talk with your mom.

819
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,100
Don't worry, I won't let him out
till you're sure of him.

820
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,600
I think he's mostly bluff.

821
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,200
How you doing?

822
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,400
You got another one!

823
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,800
-His name's Alfonso.
-What?

824
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,600
He likes to fight and show off a lot.

825
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,800
You named him after me.
Thanks a lot.

826
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,100
-It's not really his real name.
-What's his real name?

827
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:31,100
I don't know.
I don't speak canary yet.
