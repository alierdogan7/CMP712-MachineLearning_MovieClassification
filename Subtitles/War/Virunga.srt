Oh, Congo.

[newscaster 2]
The Congo's richest province, Katanga,

13
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,320
was set up as a separate state

14
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,840
with the aid of a force of
European mercenary soldiers.

If you listen carefully,

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,960

27
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,120

It's from an elephant.

29
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,680
Yeah.

30
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Hmm.

31
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,360

Where are the people who were with you?

00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,880
Quiet! Keep your voice down.

35
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,440
I don't know.

36
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,440
So where are they?

37
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,160
They've gone away.

38
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,120
Isn't this poaching?

39
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
It wasn't me.

40
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,920
The one who ran away
is the one who killed it.

00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,480
[Katembo speaking French]
Just as I'd finished primary school,

43
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,280
we were recruited secretly in our town.

44
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,840
They told us, "You're leaving...

45
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:46,520
We're sending you to university.

46
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,160
To the best university in the world!"

47
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,400
You have to follow
all orders given to you.

48
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,760
If you attempt to escape,
they'll kill you.

49
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,000
My little brother Dona
was 15 years old.

50
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,960
Among many dead bodies I found his.

51
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,760
There was nothing I could do.

52
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,280
After we buried him,
we went on with the war.

53
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,960
But my mother insisted,

54
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,440
"You must leave the army
while you're still alive."

55
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,240
So I then escaped the army
to dedicate my life to the National Park.

56
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
[clapping]

57
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,840
[speaking English] We're here at
Senkwekwe Center in Rumangabo...

58
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,200
where we have four orphan gorillas.

59
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,520
[speaking French]
They are the only mountain gorillas

60
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,880
in captivity in the world.

61

Ndakasi likes to play so much.

Ooh!

63
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,480
[speaking French]
I have my human family.

64
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,560
I always tell them,
"You are my family...

65
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,200
but we have another family
in Rumangabo...

66
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,680
which is made up of four children."

67
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,000
There is Maisha, Kaboko,
Ndeze and Ndakasi.

68
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,960
You know that until now
we've had a big problem with poaching.

69
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Poachers believe...

70
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:11,000
they can kill the parents
and take the baby away for sale.

71
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,680
This is the way we got Maisha.

72
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:33,240
Maisha was taken from poachers
who wanted to sell her.

73
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,640
She was rescued
when she was three years old.

74
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,000
[speaking English]
You can see here.

75
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,360
Maisha.

76
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,800
[speaking French] Today,
she is about 10 years and six months.

77
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,880
Kaboko is the one-handed male.

78
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,400
He lost the other hand
because of poaching.

79
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,720
Kaboko is a bit aggressive.

80
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,320

81
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
[Bauma] Maisha!

82
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,040
But they have
great affection for each other.

83
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,960
It is love.

84
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,680

[thunder rumbling]

86
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,520
When there was
the massacre of our gorillas,

87
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,040
I was out in the field.

88
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,800
I was among the rangers
who discovered their bodies.

89
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,520
It was a great tragedy.

90
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,080
We had a total of
nine gorillas killed.

91
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,640
The logic was that
once the gorillas were killed,

92
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,400
there would be no reason
to protect the park anymore.

93
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,840
[men singing in Swahili]

94
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:40,480
[Bauma] Many people came to see
what had happened to the gorillas.

95
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,320
They helped to transport their bodies.

96
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,400
It was like

97
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,080
members of the family had died.

Ndeze and Ndakasi are the two gorillas
that survived from that family.

102
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,400
Their mother and the rest
were killed in 2007.

103
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,920
When I met her...

104
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,560
she was really
so weak, weak, weak!

105
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,600
It's truly an unbelievable thing...

106
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,120
to see that she is alive,

107
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,280
and this is the reason why I say,
"I am not only a father..."

108
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,080
[speaking English]
"I'm not a father but I'm a mother."

109
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,240
[speaking French] You know that
these gorillas as you see them here,

110
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,280
we're not keeping them
just for the sake of keeping them.

111
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,240
We take care of them in order

112
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,000
to one day release them
back into the forest in good health.

113

The vowel "E."

114
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,080
Yes, good. Carry on.

115
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,640
This one, which vowel is it?

116
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,920
Underneath the vowel "E,"
which vowel is it?

117
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,120
I may die at any time in an ambush by

118
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,360
people against the protection of the park.

119
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,440
Rangers commit to protect the park,
under very dangerous conditions

120
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,800
to their last breath.

121
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,080
130 rangers have died protecting Virunga.

122
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,920

He is a small child
in whom I see lots of hope.

127
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,720
I think he can become a scientist.

128
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,000
After he has studied...

129
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,000
You said he needs
to study mathematics.

130
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,560
He can be like me for example,
you know I am a biologist.

131
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,040
Since you're a biologist,
he shouldn't become one, too.

132
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,960
He can be a geologist.

133
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,720
Yes, but it's still
in the sciences.

134
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,640
Change is good!

00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:47,280
We don't want

137

to inherit a world or a country
as broken as ours.

138
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,960
[newscaster speaking English]
There are worrying reports

139
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,360
that around a dozen different
armed groups in the region

140
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,560
are uniting against the Congolese army.

141
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,240
In a forest close to
Congo's border with Rwanda,

142
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,080
we meet members of
the country's newest rebel army

143
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,200
known as M23.

144
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,480
The Congolese army
is in no mood for compromise.

145
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,520
It is sending in thousands of
reinforcements to the front line.

146
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,040
These are dangerous times
in Eastern Congo.

147
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,240
Fear has driven people
out of these villages and farmland.

148
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,760
Only the weak and old have stayed on.

149
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,240
This isn't a war yet,
but it could be soon...

150
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,920
unless the guns
are replaced with diplomacy.

151

Director of Virunga National Park.

153
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,640
[Emmanuel de Merode]
Good morning, everyone.

154
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,000
I was anxious to drop by the station
at morning roll-call.

155
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,200
Firstly, to greet you...

156
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,680
but also because you will all have heard
about the new troubles for the army.

157
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,800
We all hope it is a temporary situation

158
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,000
that will be sorted out.

159
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:41,120
The army will manage the situation
and activities will continue normally.

160
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,960
It's important to hope for the best,

161
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,680
but also be ready for the worst.

162
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,680
[speaking English] I was
sworn in as warden by the park authorities

163
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,440
in Kinshasa in August 2008.

164
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,320
My work is to manage the park,

165
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,520
to ensure that it's adequately protected.

166
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,000
And that the laws of the land
are respected within its boundaries.

167
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,360
But also to sustainably develop
the park's resources...

168
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
[speaking French]
It's far, right?

169
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,000
[speaking English] ...to bring greater
prosperity to the local population,

170
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,200
and stability to the region.

171
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,200
[speaking French]
I was appointed Station Chief in June 2006

172
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,360
by the Kinshasa office

173
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,160
to assume management of
Virunga's central sector.

174
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,760
We are at the heart of
the Rwindi Hotel here...

175
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,240
it is here that

When we started managing this sector
in May 2010,

there was almost nothing
because there were soldiers everywhere.

However, now there are antelopes,
warthogs, elephants, lions,

and a significant number of hippos.

So there is hope,
and even buffalos are coming back.

You know that the gorillas we have here

as they grow,
they become more intelligent.

They also gain weight
and become stronger and stronger.

Even stronger than us.

204
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,760
So you need to know their psychology
to care for them.

205
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,880
You cannot force them to do something

206
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,880
because if they
decide to be stubborn,

207
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,600

When you give them
something they like,

they realize that you're their friend.

217
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,960
We do not give it to them as food...

218

but rather as
a tactic to handle them.

219

And then,
you will always have good results.

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,560
I am not saying that
because I am a ranger,

350
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,320
it's the law that says this.

351
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,360
If you look at everyone in the chain
of authorities in charge of the park,

352
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,000
Emmanuel de Merode is the only one
who doesn't feed on it.

353
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,760
We wonder what's wrong with him.

354
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,080
Everyone's noticed
that oil is something big.

355
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,000
It's worth billions of dollars.

356
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,320
It looks like he wants his government,

357
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,080
the Belgian one,
to be part of this exploitation,

358
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:09,920
or perhaps he wants them
to take control at a later stage.

359
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,920
Either way, he's the one
hindering the process,

360
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,960
and he's the only one.

361
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,800
At the moment,
the president's office,

362
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,600
everyone in the capital,
all have authorized it.

363
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:26,520
Even the minister for the environment
has authorized it.

364
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:31,200
So far it's simply a matter of checking
whether there is any oil.

365
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,320
It's like checking whether
a person's liver or heart is okay,

366
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,560
just checking if there's
something wrong or not.

367
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,240
I think you have come to the right place.

368
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,040
When your people
want to come into the park,

369
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,640
I can arrange things in my sector.

370
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,640
I can tell my people
that this is how things are going to be.

371
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,160
I'll have to speak to the minister,

372
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,280
so that the minister
can speak to you personally.

373
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,800
So the safety of the people of SOCO

374
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,560
can be given to Rodrigue
and his people.

375
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,040
But that should be your secret.

376
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,200
Just like that we can finalize it.

377
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,640
You get your cut,

378
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,280
and maybe you give me
a little of what they give you.

379
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,440
No problem.

380
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,320
[Katembo] People are being approached
by SOCO supporters and offered money.

381
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,000
Even people in Virunga's organization
are now working to undermine the park.

382
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,080
[speaking indistinctly]

383
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,680
It is unclear who can be trusted.

384
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,360
[kids screaming excitedly]

385
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,480
What is the importance of this lake
for you as a community?

386
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,320
In Vitshumbi
we are about 2,000 inhabitants,

387
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:08,720
and all of us depend on this lake

388
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,160
as we don't have
any other work except fishing.

389
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,320
Therefore, fishing within
the Virunga National Park

390
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,280
is life for the community.

391
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,800
Our lives depend on it.

392
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,440
[speaking Swahili]

393
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,920
[Mukura speaking French] He says,
"We don't care about oil,

394
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,360
we earn our living
from the lake and fishing."

395
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,040
You see, we are barely surviving here.

396
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:46,000
In the past, things were much better.

397
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,640
But with the recent fighting,

398
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,160
people find their
living standards are falling.

399
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,000
[Gouby] Did SOCO come to ask for your
views about what is going on?

400
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,280
No, SOCO came in like a parachute.

401
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,800
We got up one morning
to see beautiful vehicles driving by.

402
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,680
We went to see who it was

403
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,280
and there were a few whites
and Captain Feruzi.

404
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,360
He's a military intelligence agent.

405
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:22,160
We were shocked to see him doing
a presentation to the people of the lake.

406
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,240
He told people that,
"If you accept SOCO here...

407
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:32,320
they will build
universities, roads and schools...

408
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:39,080
and you will have access
to cultivate in the park...

409
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,640
since at that moment
the park will be declassified."

410
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,800
All this frightens us locals.

411
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:53,520
It says, "Look, soldiers are here and
they could harm you if you don't comply."

412
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,640
[gorillas gibbering]

413
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,080
Ndakasi!

414
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,480
[speaking English] How are you?

415
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,720
Ndeze is expressing that...

416
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,800
she's not... happy because...

417
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,160
the breakfast is not ready yet.

418
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,600
Ndeze, what is going wrong? What's wrong?

419
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,880
You are going to have your breakfast.

420
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,280
Never mind.

421
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,880
Ooh.

422
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,480
[Bauma grunts]

423
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:43,240
The daily job to do is...
to give them food...

424
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,080
to stay with them...

425
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,600
to play, because they don't have...
their parents.

426
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,880
[laughing]

427
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,960
Ndeze is smiling.

428
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,360
Ah, Kaboko!

429
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,080
They must not feel that
they are abandoned.

430
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,400
They must feel they are in the family.

431
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:31,680
You know, the war in Congo
started a long time ago...

432
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,760
and unfortunately...

433
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,840
we lost many people.

434
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,520
My father died in the war.

435
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,600
Yeah...

436
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,280
he died when I was very young.

437
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:58,080
My father, he's the one who taught me...
how to respect animals.

438
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,160
So...

439
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,200
today, I am doing

440
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:09,240
what my father created in my heart

441
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,760
when I was a little boy.

442
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,120
[Katembo speaking French]
Oil is an exhaustible resource

443
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,240
whereas fauna and flora
are inexhaustible resources.

444
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,160
Even if they are allowed to
exploit the oil,

445
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,560
it will one day come to an end.

446
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,440
But the park will remain
through the years.

447
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,120
From generation to generation,
people will see this park.

448
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,440
[speaking indistinctly]

449
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,840
-[Katembo speaking local] Big boss!
-[laughing]

450
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,520
[Captain Feruzi] Josue!

451
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,480
Look how big he's grown.
He opened the door for you!

452
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,080
Now they need you!

453
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,320
They know you are important
in that sector where you can help us.

454
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:43,640
They also know that you are
"the right hand" of the park director.

455
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,360
Do you understand?
This means, "We're buying you."

456
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,960
First accept and let us collaborate

457
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,760
and then they will be in the position to
give you whatever you are asking for...

458
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,680
While we are working together,
and you hear things,

459
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,160
you'll feed us information secretly.

460
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,240
[Katembo] Directly to you. Whenever I can.

461
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:09,000
We are trying to gauge
Emmanuel de Merode's position.

462
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,520
So what are we talking about?

463
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:12,640
3,000 dollars.

464
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,440
3,000? Okay.

465
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,560
[Captain Feruzi] You'll get your share
and no one will know a thing!

466
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,960
[both laughing]

467
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,320
[Katembo in French] Captain Feruzi claims
to work for SOCO security contractors.

468
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,320
He is offering bribes
to work against the park.

469
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,000
This corruption threatens
everything we're working for.

470
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,160
[Gouby speaking English] SOCO has to work
with a lot of different people

471
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,680
to make this work.

472
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:04,600
They... are in touch with
and working with a lot of... politicians,

473
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,880
a few people in the government.

474
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,640
SOCO has an office on the lake in Goma,

475
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,480
but it's very difficult
for me to go and talk to them

476
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,120
because they obviously
wouldn't really talk to anyone,

477
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,400
and certainly not to
a journalist like that.

478
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,240
And then I met Julien.

479
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,640
Julien Lechenault
is one of SOCO's employees.

480
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,600
He's the main manager
here in Eastern Congo.

481
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,920
[speaking indistinctly]

482
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,560
[Gouby] He is about 30 and he's French.

483
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,240
He started working for SOCO,
I think, two years ago.

484
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,240
He's in charge of liaising

485
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:46,840
between the operation on the ground
and the top management in London.

486
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,960
He told me that SOCO does everything
transparently and by the book

487
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:56,240
and he is the one getting
the oil operation going in the park.

488
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:01,000
I decided to start
investigating SOCO through him,

489
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,360
and so I started meeting him
and filming him undercover.

490
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,960
-[Lechenault] Right? Just sit in there.
-[Gouby laughs]

491
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,760
Okay, I'm going to the bathroom,
I'll meet you downstairs.

492
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,080
[glasses clinking]

493
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,640
[people speaking indistinctly]

494
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,360
[Gouby] So we got a drink
and then we sat down for dinner...

495
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,640
and then the conversation got onto
oil exploration through SOCO's work.

496
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,560
[Lechenault speaking French]
It is the goal to check

497
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,200
if we have oil and then we compare.

498
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,000
Conservation, how much is it worth?
Oil, how much is it worth?

499
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,080
Do we start production?

500
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,880
But these people have their own vision
of the park's future.

501
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,920
They've been looking after it
for almost a century.

502
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:40,640
Moreover, it is full of rebels,
full of poachers, full of mess.

503
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,520
It is completely absurd.

504
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,400
The best solution, effective for everyone,
is to recolonize these countries.

505
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,840
There is no other solution.

506
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,360
For things to go well,
we have to manage them

507
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,960
because they are not able
to manage themselves.

508
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:09,320
They are like children, actually.
They aren't mature enough, I'd say.

509
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,480
[Gouby] You are tough
with the Congolese people.

510
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:19,040
No, no, I know them too well.

511
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,000
[speaking English] One of the main
problems that SOCO has had so far,

512
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:27,840
it's the park itself.

513
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,840
It's Emmanuel de Merode.

514
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,560
[Lechenault speaking French]
There is this guy, who blocks,

515
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,360
because he's Belgian,
from the royal family, etc.

516
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,920
And he's responsible for the park,

517
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:45,560
so he's got all the power in this park.

518
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:51,800
His management gave us permission
but he stands in our way.

519
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:57,840
There is a lot of tension
between SOCO and Emmanuel.

520
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:07,080
I think he plays
his political role a little bit,

521
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,480
as a member of the royal family.

522
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,320
[Gouby laughs]

523
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,400
I would quite like to be his friend,
but he doesn't want to be my friend.

524
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,000
[Gouby] Did you try?

525
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,320
No. I shook his hand once.

526
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,800
I'd been in Goma three days.

527
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,440
I didn't know anything.

528
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,160
[Gouby in English] I think,
over the next few months,

529
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,400
I'm going to carry on meeting with him
as much as possible

530
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:52,600
to follow how their activities is going
and try to get more information from him.

531
00:49:54,120 --> 00:50:00,160
I'm also keen to find out if the
M23 rebels have any interest in the oil.

532
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,080
[thunder rumbling]

533
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,120
[Katembo speaking French]
Okay, thanks.

534
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,080
Thanks, see you soon.

535
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,240
[speaking Swahili]
I'll keep the car in drive position

536
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,920
in case we have to get out of here fast.

537
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,680
We'll go together with Josue.

538
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,880
[speaking Swahili]

539
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,720
Josue, how are you doing?

540
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,200
[laughs]

541
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,400
[man 1 speaking French]
This is Pieter Wright.

542
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,760
He is my boss.

543
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:27,520
He is a security advisor with SOCO.

544
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,320
[Wright speaking English]
The reason I wanted to see you

545
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,000
was to be able to put a name
to your face because...

546
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:38,000
very soon, we will start
working in that area.

547
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,480
We will contact you regularly.

548
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,360
[man 2 speaking Swahili]
We will now give you a little something...

549
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,080
[laughing]

550
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,560
[Wright speaking English]
Just to say thank you.

551
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:08,480
[de Merode speaking French]
It is important that we work together.

552
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,000
So what I want to say with regard to
the difficulties we are facing,

553
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:20,400
is that if we are strong
and we withstand the situation,

554
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,320
it is because we work as a team.

555
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,520
Please always remember
that you have done a great job.

556
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,600
You have shown your courage

557
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,320
and some of your friends

558
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,840
have died for the rebuilding of the park.

559
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:43,000
The other thing
I wanted to tell you about is

560
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:50,040
the confusion which has developed
around the oil issue with SOCO.

561
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,360
And what I want
to tell you is very simple.

562
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,680
We are here to enforce the law.

563
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,960
It is law which allows

564
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,280
peace re-establishment
and country reconstruction.

565
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:06,640
We are not here
to work for business interests,

566
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,040
be it with regard to oil.

567
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,600
It is about integrity and honesty.

568
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,160
We have to maintain
the respect and discipline

569
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,480
which characterize us.

570
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,240
[Gouby speaking English]
I'm doing a boy's band.

571
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,360
M23 cover album.

572
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,720
[speaking French] Okay. I'll give
the whole pack away, then. What is that?

573
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,720
[Gouby] What do you want to drink?

574
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,200
A coffee?

575
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,600
Maybe not Heineken again,
it's a bit early.

576
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,560
[man] It's Sunday!

577
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,640
You have Heineken on Sunday?

578
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,440
[man] On Sunday, on Saturday...

579
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,160
The other days I can't drink much
because I'm working.

580
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,160
[Gouby] And at the moment
are you working a lot?

581
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,400
[man] Communication is so much work,
it's tiring.

582
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:01,160
I am a great notable of Rutshuru.

583
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,800
[Gouby] You have a lot of land there,
don't you? How many hectares?

584
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,520
[man] 2,000 hectares, that's it.

585
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,840
And the friends from SOCO
have put marker stones on my land

586
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,800
to mark out the Block 5, their concession.

587
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:22,760
Some people don't like
SOCO doing its work here.

588
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:32,200
Minister Vunabandi asked me to calm them.

589
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,280
I did that job.

590
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,080
I've communicated to the population

591
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,000
that it's better to work with SOCO
than work with the park.

592
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,480
You told them that it was better?

593
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,560
Yes, I told the people
better with SOCO than with the park.

594
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,360
If SOCO works with us,
in particular with me...

595
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,640
I am in the M23, but outside the M23
I have my private businesses.

596
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,480
[Gouby] All right,
so you would have a percentage?

597
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,840
[man] Yes, we are asking for a percentage.

598
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,160
They cannot exploit oil without us.

599
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:05,320
It's a percentage,
whether it is 0.01 or 0.001.

600
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,960
[Gouby] Yes, it can be a lot of money.

601
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,280
[man] A lot.

602
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,760
[Gouby speaking English]
Rebels like Colonel Kazarama

603
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,560
are all scrambling to profit from
the oil exploration in the region.

604
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,920
Although, so far, there is no evidence

605
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,360
that SOCO has entered into
financial deals with them.

606
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:34,760
By operating in this environment...
I think that SOCO are playing with fire...

607
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:41,800
and they are playing with forces
that are extremely powerful and dangerous.

608
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,480
[indistinct conversations]

609
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,640
[flies buzzing]

610
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,480
[Katembo speaking French]
They used a chainsaw

611
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,920
to remove part of the head
and the upper jaw.

612
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,080
They took that, as well as the tusks.

613
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:20,800
Examining the ballistics
suggests this wasn't

614
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,360
the work of poachers
we are familiar with.

615
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,920
This was a military style operation.

616
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,560
[de Merode speaking English]
Every single armed group that is operating

617
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:38,040
in Eastern Congo is tied to the illegal
exploitation of natural resources.

618
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,120
That's how they survive.

619
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,920
And they all have... mixed agendas.

620
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,040
You know, they have an official agenda
that they... that they broadcast,

621
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,200
but in reality...

622
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,800
all their efforts are focused on
survival and making money.

623
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,520
[speaking Swahili]
We will march on the capital Kinshasa!

624
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,640
[crowd cheers]

625
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,800
Long live M23!

626
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,880
[crowd cheers]

627
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:14,560
[speaking French]
Ladies, gentlemen, we regretfully announce

628
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:19,200
the resumption of war
by the Kinshasa government.

629
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,040
[Gouby speaking French]
So the goal isn't to gain more territory?

630
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,680
No, let me be clear.

631
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,040
If the government agree
to enter into dialog with us

632
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:34,720
and suspend their attacks,
we are here for peace.

633
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:41,800
If they continue to violate the truce,
then we know what we will do.

634
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,720
[gunfire in distance]

635
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,560
[explosions in distance]

636
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,120
[Gouby speaking French]
Hey! Did you get my text?

637
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,440
No, no, no, you didn't tell me
where you were.

638
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:32,880
Okay. Opposite Rouge
and it's called "Grill"?

639
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:39,240
Okay, cool. Let's do that. Perfect.

640
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,720
[Gouby speaking English] I thought that
I would meet Julien by himself.

641
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:21,240
So when I arrived, I was quite surprised
to see him with two other people,

642
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:25,680
one of whom was
a SOCO security subcontractor.

643
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,600
[Gouby speaking French]
Please be careful, sir.

644
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,720
[Gouby speaking English]
I hate that.

645
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,560
[John] If you pull the trigger now,
it goes off.

646
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,640
[Gouby] I hate when they do that.

647
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,480
[Lechenault] No security on!

648
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,480
[man] Just gonna get close like that.

649
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,880
[Gouby] So we speak English tonight.

650
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,320
[man]
No, Français!

651
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,600
[man] My Français is a bit shit.

652
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,440
[Gouby chuckles]

653
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,040
What do you define yourself as?

654
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,720
[John] Some people would say
I'm a mercenary.

655
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:00,880
[Gouby] You're a mercenary?

656
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,520
[John] Some people would...
some people wouldn't.

657
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:10,320
[Gouby] John... was this
kind of crazy British...

658
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,200
former-Special Forces guy

659
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:19,240
who bragged a lot about how
he had been in all these crazy situations,

660
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,400
killed lots of people,

661
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,760
and saying these horrible things
about Congolese.

662
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,800
[John] The people here are nice,
but I tell you one thing,

663
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,360
they've got bloodlust.

664
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,440
They kill for the fucking sake of killing
and they fucking hinge on it.

665
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,440
There are lots of rebels...

666
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,680
you look at them
and straight away you think...

667
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,360
The energy is up and you think...

668
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,000
-they enjoy it.
-[Lechenault] Fucking mad, yeah?

669
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,840
They like it and there is nothing
you can do about it.

670
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,720
You can't educate, you can't...

671
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,800
[Lechenault] Culture them?

672
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,240
[John] There is nothing you can change
in their mentality

673
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,120
because it's fucking primeval.

674
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:56,280
It is primeval, it is ancient,
it is inbred psychology

675
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,800
that you cannot fucking change.

676
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,400
[Gouby] Don't you talk to these guys?

677
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:02,800
[John] Who?

678
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,920
[Lechenault] Which ones?
[John] To which ones?

679
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,040
[Lechenault] The rebels?
[Gouby] Yeah?

680
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,880
[Lechenault] We talk to them every day.
Well, not me, but subcontractors.

681
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:14,600
[Gouby] SOCO contractors
are in daily talks with rebel groups...

682
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:18,680
and potentially even paying them
to be able to work in the area.

683
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:23,520
Although, Julien claims
to have no part in any of this.

684
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,800
[Lechenault] We don't deal
with the rebels.

685
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:32,440
You've got to give them money
to be able to travel through the area.

686
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,000
[John] What do you think you're doing
with DEI (SOCO security contractors)?

687
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,080
[Lechenault clears throat]

688
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,880
[John] How much do you think
SOCO's paid fucking...

689
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,160
[Lechenault] Shut up!

690
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,160
[John] Come on!
[Lechenault] Don't...

691
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,360
We have a journalist here!

692
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,560
[John] If you're gonna be honest,
be honest.

693
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,880
And while you're paying them and
keeping them happy, they'll work with you.

694
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,320
[Gouby] Julien was implying that

695
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,720
they're paying their security company
to deal with all these security issues,

696
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,040
and so the security company...

697
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:03,680
receives a certain amount of money
and that was that.

698
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,240
They just let them do
whatever they need to do.

699
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,160
[Lechenault]
I never spoke to a fucking rebel myself.

700
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,400
That's why we subcontract that shit.

701
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,160
[John] Who's paying the fucking money?
You or them?

702
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,040
[Lechenault] Subcontractors.
[John] No, you can't get away with that.

703
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,680
[Lechenault] It doesn't matter
where the money comes from.

704
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,560
[John] Of course it does,
without the money the job doesn't happen.

705
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,520
Fucking civilians don't get killed.

706
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,160
You don't have war.

707
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,240
It's the money that fuels everything.

708
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:32,600
So to give them money and then turn around
and say it's nothing to do with us...

709
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,560
It's just fucking hypocritical.

710
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,360
You know, it's just... It's playing God.

711
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,280
But if you're gonna do it,
at least be fucking honest about it!

712
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:45,520
It's business, it's business,
and business is business.

713
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,760
That was tricky.

714
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,240
This kind of thing
that you hear in movies...

715
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:59,160
and to hear that in real life
from people you're having dinner with...

716
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,640
[Lechenault] Now we can see
the value of that park,

717
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,680
mining-wise.

718
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,600
It's just a fucking mine, this park.

719
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,680
[John] It could be colossal.

720
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,520
-With the intelligence, it's crazy...
-[John] It is colossal.

721
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,240
...the money you could pull out.

722
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:21,000
[Lechenault] Now what they defend,
I'm not sure it's all about animals.

723
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,600
I'm not sure at all.

724
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:23,720
[John] It ain't gorillas, put it that way.

725
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,480
[Lechenault] I don't think
it could be so highly involved

726
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,920
to do the shit they do.

727
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,640
[John] Unless they're shitting diamonds
and fucking pissing iron ore,

728
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,200
they don't give a fuck
about the gorillas.

729
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,880
Fuck me, it's a monkey,
who gives a fuck about a fucking monkey?

730
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,560
[gunshot in distance]

731
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,720
[explosion in distance]

732
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,720
[explosion in distance]

733
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:17,360
[Bauma speaking English]
We were very worried about the fighting.

734
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:25,040
We are hearing so many... bombs.

735
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,240
Many, many, many bombs.

736
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,200
[explosions continue]

737
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,400
When gorillas hear the sound of bombs,

738
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:44,880
they want to be close to the caregivers.

739
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:02,960
[explosions continue]

740
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,560
[reporter] Well, we heard
some heavy firing,

741
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,440
and then suddenly, all these tanks

742
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,960
heading southwards,
away from the front line.

743
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,680
Some of the soldiers
that we managed to speak to

744
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:21,960
said they'd just fallen into an ambush
just up the road,

745
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,840
and now they're beating a retreat.

746
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:28,760
[de Merode speaking French]
Firstly, as you all know

747
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,160
there were clashes yesterday

748
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:36,400
and the fighting intensified in Bunagana.

749
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:42,240
But we need to prepare ourselves in case

750
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:49,240
that fighting may spread
and affect us here in Rumangabo.

751
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,520
[speaking French]
It's Melanie.

752
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:03,880
They're approaching.

753
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,000
Yes, the M23.

754
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:09,080
And the army is fleeing towards Bukavu.

755
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,600
[sighs, clicks tongue]

756
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,800
[de Merode speaking French]
The villagers are about to start leaving.

757
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,360
We are going to stay here.

758
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:31,200
I just wanted to know
about the food for the gorillas.

759
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:34,680
How many days' worth do we have left?

760
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,200
Two days.

761
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:40,400
The M23 rebels are in Rubare.

762
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:45,160
If they cut off Mwaro,
we'll have to cope with what we have.

763
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,360
[speaking English] Hi. It's Melanie.
Can you hear me?

764
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,360
Hi... I can't hear you very well,

765
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:58,240
but... so basically, the M23,
they're about to take the town.

766
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,920
The Congolese army is fleeing.

767
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:04,680
The governor has been evacuated.

768
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,480
[explosion in distance]

769
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,320
[explosion in distance]

770
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,720
[explosion nearby]

771
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,280
[men talking heatedly in Swahili]

772
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,600
[speaking English]
We think we have a problem.

773
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:37,440
The danger is near us.

774
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,520
[explosion]

775
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,560
[explosions in distance]

776
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,760
[Mitamba speaking French]
Good morning again.

777
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:56,120
I wanted to tell you that
the explosions you heard some time ago

778
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:00,440
were M23 rebel actions.

779
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:07,480
You should all have your essential items
packed and be ready for evacuation.

780
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,600
PRESS

781
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,200
[Gouby speaking French]
We are going to Kibati actually.

782
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,600
It's a bit further.

783
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:44,280
Sorry, is there a problem?

784
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,520
[crying]

785
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,000
[helicopter blades whirring]

786
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,440
[child wailing]

787
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,200
[Mitamba speaking Swahili]
I'll start by calling the names.

788
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,840
If you hear your name,

789
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:18,120
move aside with your belongings
and children so that I can see you.

790
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:23,960
If there is excessive luggage,
I will leave it!

791
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,800
[de Merode speaking French]
They are advancing.

792
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,400
They're nearly at Kalengera.

793
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,520
We've got to hurry.

794
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,400
If everybody is there,
then we must start the evacuation.

795
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,640
[Mitamba]
Yes, let's evacuate everyone who's ready.

796
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,000
[loud gunfire]

797
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,840
[Gouby yelps]

798
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,440
[Gouby speaking English] The fighting
just broke out just next to us.

799
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,960
[stammering] I don't know
if we're doing the right thing.

800
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,040
[speaking French]
Hi, is everything okay?

801
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:22,920
No, he's really weakened.

802
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,080
[Mitamba] What's caused it?

803
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:31,080
Diarrhea. He suffered from diarrhea
the whole night last night.

804
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:35,480
But yesterday, he played and he ate.

805
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,560
[Mitamba] What is his name?

806
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:37,800
[Bauma] Kaboko.

807
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,600
[Mitamba] Ah, he's the one called Kaboko.

808
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,720
He is suffering.

809
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,280
You see, he's suffering.

810
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,000
[de Merode urging]

811
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:13,400
[speaking French] If they ask us
to hand over our arms...

812
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,560
Yes.

813
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,760
...we'll have to react fast
and hide them.

814
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:23,960
If they ask us to do that,
and I'm telling you I know them well,

815
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:27,200
it would be worse than you think.

816
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:30,120
If they are telling us
to hand them over...

817
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,720
[de Merode]
You all know the situation.

818
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:39,000
The M23 rebels are about to arrive here.

819
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:46,600
Our role now is to protect the station.

820
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:55,040
It is very likely that this zone
falls under the control of M23.

821
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,400
And I am counting on you to stay with me.

822
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,600
Our role is simply to stay here

823
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,720
to watch over the station
which is there for the park.

824
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:11,040
If they come here,
we cannot fight against them.

825
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:15,520
I will be the last to leave Rumangabo.

826
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,920
[heavy gunfire in distance]

827
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:22,160
[Gouby] Stop, stop! Stop.
[driver] Yes, yes, yes.

828
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,640
[Gouby] Quickly, let's go!
[driver] Get in.

829
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,440
[driver] Here, here, here.
[Gouby] Quick, quick, quick!

830
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,680
[speaking French]

831
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:48,400
[driver speaking English]
Press. Press. Press, oui.

832
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,880
[speaking French]
Going to Ihusi. Yes.

833
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,520
[de Merode speaking French]
The Congolese army are deploying

834
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,800
around the station.

835
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,840
[Mburanumwe]
Rutshuru is under the control of M23.

836
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:14,440
[de Merode]
Really?

837
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:15,880
[gunfire in distance]

838
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,640
[de Merode]
There is going to be trouble here.

839
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,640
[Mburanumwe] Yes, I think so.

840
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,640
[Bauma speaking English]
Many people left Rumangabo.

841
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,360
But, for me,

842
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:39,440
I felt obliged to stay with gorillas here.

843
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:48,880
You must justify why you are here
on this Earth.

844
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:56,880
Gorillas justify why I am here.

845
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,160
[speaking French]
They are my life.

846
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,000
So if it is about dying,

847
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:13,040
I will die for the gorillas.

848
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:29,600
[speaking Swahili]
We've been informed

849
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:33,840
that the enemy is on his way.

850
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,840
You know why we are here.

851
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:54,480
[Mburanumwe speaking French]
If they were to go further over,

852
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,960
we'd be between the hammer and the anvil.

853
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:02,840
Even here... we are between
the hammer and the anvil.

854
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08,000
Yes.

855
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:20,360
[gunfire]

856
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,000
[explosion]

857
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,240
[speaking French] They're here.

858
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,960
Yes, M23 are in Rumangabo.

859
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,440
[gunfire continues]

860
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,320
[man groaning]

861
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:13,440
Oh, mama! Ma, mama!

862
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,600
[screaming]

863
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,280
[heavy gunfire]

864
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,120
[gunfire continues]

865
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,120
[reporter speaking English]
Until the early hours of Sunday morning,

866
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:55,920
all of this territory here
was controlled by the Congolese army

867
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,240
and their allies,
the United Nations Peacekeepers.

868
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,960
But that has now been reversed,

869
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:05,960
and these rebels here
are now within easy striking distance

870
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,600
of the provincial capital, Goma.

871
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,000
[man speaking French]
The M23 rebels are here.

872
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,960
They've entered.

873
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:39,840
So there is nothing.
No more Congolese soldiers. They left.

874
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:40,920
The country is sold.

875
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:43,560
[rebels cheering]

876
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,680
[rebels cheering]

877
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,600
[Bauma speaking English]
It was very difficult for the vet

878
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:47,320
to come here because of the war.

879
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:54,400
All the night, yeah, I was with him.

880
01:21:55,480 --> 01:22:00,280
3:00 a.m., he became very weak.

881
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,880
At 5:00 a.m.,

882
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:11,160
we lost our lovely gorilla, Kaboko.

883
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,480
He left this world.

884
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:59,960
[de Merode] So, our area has now been
overrun by the M23 militias.

885
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:05,080
It has created, for us,
a huge level of uncertainty.

886
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,880
It was impossible for us to leave,

887
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,680
because if we were to leave,
we would lose everything.

888
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,400
We'd lose the park
and the wildlife would be at risk,

889
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,080
and we'd lose everything that we've built

890
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,560
over the last few years
to keep this park going.

891
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:29,160
There was very heavy shelling
and a lot of gunfire.

892
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:33,760
Many people got hurt in the villages.

893
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:42,680
Some of them came here looking for help
and we did our best to help them,

894
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:47,920
but they were very badly injured,
and some of them died.

895
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,760
It was probably
the most violent period we've known.

896
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:37,240
[Gouby] There was about 60,000
displaced people living here,

897
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:39,560
and they're all gone.

898
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,160
[doctor 1 speaking French]
In the last few days,

899
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:55,720
we have had many wounded people.

900
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,760
The majority are children.

901
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:08,280
All these people were shot.

902
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:14,480
This one almost died
but we gave him a blood transfusion.

903
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,200
[Gouby wincing]
Baby.

904
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,480
Do you know how old is he?

905
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,880
[doctor 2] Five... he's five.

906
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:44,640
[John speaking English]
It's the money that fuels everything.

907
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:48,320
Now we can see the value of that park.

908
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,680
[speaking French]
Yes, we are asking for a percentage.

909
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:55,040
They cannot exploit oil without us.

910
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:58,840
[John speaking English] It's business,
it's business, and business is business.

911
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:02,280
[Lechenault speaking French]
So now there are death threats coming.

912
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:05,080
Death threats, from both sides.

913
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:09,080
Some people are threatening
to kill de Merode.

914
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:12,240
It doesn't come from us,
we don't know from whom.

915
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,840
They know that the blockage
comes from him.

916
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,760
They are going to kill him.

917
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:24,160
[Gouby speaking English] This company is
operating with the same lack of oversight

918
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:28,040
that this country has experienced
so many times,

919
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:31,480
and it's feeding into the conflict.

920
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:37,680
What I'm really scared about
when this is published,

921
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:41,120
is that people read it and...

922
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:45,880
then they just go on with their life
and nothing is done about this.

923
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:52,000
For me, it's not just another
questionable company in Africa...

924
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:57,360
It's a company that has been attacking
one of the only hopes this region has.

925
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,320
It's intense...

926
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:04,880
and it can be quite sad... actually.

927
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,680
[de Merode] So the fighting's
been very violent in this area,

928
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:46,080
and it's meant that
we haven't been able to find the gorillas.

929
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:49,000
We're extremely worried
about their safety.

930
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:54,920
Now, finally, we've been able to get back.

931
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,280
[flies buzzing]

932
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,240
[thumps chest]

933
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,720
[de Merode speaking French]
We're going to celebrate.

934
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:47,960
There's an even smaller one.

935
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,040
It's only 3 months old.

936
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:52,680
[de Merode speaking English]
New birth.

937
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:55,080
So that's very, very good news.

938
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,800
Ndakasi!

939
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:22,800
Ndakasi.

940
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:31,800
[speaking French]
You know that Kaboko was the only male

941
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:34,120
that we had here at the Senkwekwe Center.

942
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,800
In my heart, I still miss him.

943
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:47,720
I really miss him.

944
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:59,600
But I have started understanding
that these things happen.

945
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:04,560
And even the other gorillas,
especially Maisha...

946
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:08,640
Maisha also lost Kaboko.

947
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,680
But...

948
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:18,440
We are trying to realize life goes on.

949
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:34,000
[Katembo] I have accepted to give
the best of myself,

950
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:41,000
so that wildlife can be safeguarded
beyond all pressure.

951
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:51,880
Beyond all spirit of
greediness about money.

952
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:57,200
Beyond all things.

953
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:05,440
All that could happen to me...

954
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,360
I will accept it.

955
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:12,600
I am not special.

956
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,240
[trumpets]

957
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:36,200
We cannot stand weak and say,
"SOCO, go ahead."

958
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:42,720
[growls]

959
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:02,600
In the end, we will be judged...

960
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:09,600
if we just stand by as the park vanishes.

961
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:23,440
But our wish is that
this park lives forever.

962
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,040
[speaking Swahili]

963
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:41,200
[Bauma cooing]
