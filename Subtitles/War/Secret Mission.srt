- Major Garnett?
- He's inside.
-I've a message for him.

4
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,900
- All right.
- I'm going in, son,
I'll show you the way.

5
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:36,133
Right, thank you.

6
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:43,400
This way.

7
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:48,967
Come in.

8
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:50,367

Please sign here.

10
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

11
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,967
Go and find Private Clark,
and send him here at once,
will you?

12
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,267
Very good, sir.

But Mrs. Beaton says
stir slowly.

16
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,967
I have told you a hundred
times that your Mrs. Beeton

17
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:27,533
Was a savage. A barbarian!

18
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,800
To make this souffle...
Give me an egg,
I will show you.

19
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:33,767
An egg? Don't you know
there's a war on?

20
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,600
(SCOFFS) I seem to have
heard something about it.

21
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:36,933
Raoul? Just a minute.

22
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:39,200
Lunch is almost ready.

23
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:42,100
Would've been ready hours ago
if Captain Carnot had left it
to Mrs. Beeton.

24
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:45,667
Now I understand
why the English will never,
never learn to cook.

25
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,500
Well!

26
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,933
And who invented roast beef,
if you please?

What is it?

28
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,500
Mackenzie didn't get back,
so we're off tonight.

29
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,933
Just had this from HQ.

30
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,200
- We are taking Captain Gowan
and Private Clark with us?
- Sure.

31
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:05,700
I'd hate to go on a trip
like this without Nobby Clark.

32
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:08,267
Besides, he knows that part of
the country as well as you do.

33
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,200
Man's well-read. I believe
he's got Indian blood
in his veins.

34
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:12,600
He can smell his way about.

36

37
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:18,533
Yes, I'm looking
forward to it.

38
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,933
So am I, except
it's going to be a bit tricky.

39
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:23,133
It will be odd going back.

about the place.

41
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,233

keep my temper.
- I'll watch you.

42
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:34,133
- You sent for me, sir?
- PETER: Yes.

43
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,933
- You know Saint-Antoine,
don't you?
- Yes, sir.

44
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,700
- Think you could find your
way there from the coast?
- Yes, sir.

45
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:41,500
Why?

46
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:43,500
Well, I haven't told you
before, but that's
where we're going.

47
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:45,633
We're never going to
Saint-Antoine.

48
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,733
Well, that's where
my old woman lives.

49
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,267
Yes, I know.

50
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,267
- Well, don't you want to
see her again?
- No, thank you very much, sir.

51
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,367
You see, it's one of the joys
of this here war that
I can't see her again.

52
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:58,733
- I'm sorry,
that's where we're going.
- Oh, it's not fair!

- Cigarette?
- Thank you very much, sir.

in the world,
they had to pick the one place

55

Where my old woman lives.

56
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,367
No, it's not right, sir.

57
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:07,967
- Well, don't worry about it,
I'll get somebody else.
- Yes, sir.

58
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,133
- Sir?
- Yes?

59
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,067
Sir...

60
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:15,933
It ain't safe to
go without me.

61
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:17,967
I suppose I'll have to go
with you.

62
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,067
It's a great sacrifice, mind.

63
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:23,300
- See, I'm putting my head
in a noose.
- Well, that's excellent.

64
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:25,800
- Hello, Red.
- Hello, Raoul. Hello, Peter.

65
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,500
Hello. You been telephoning
your blonde?

66
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:29,567
No, that's all washed up.

67
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:32,567
She's taking this austerity
business too seriously.

68
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:35,767
You know, you ought to have
joined the Air Force, they're
much more successful.

69
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,133
Oh, I get along, sir,
I get along.

70
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,800
I met a little redhead
last night,
and she's got everything.

71
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:42,400
At least I think she has.

72
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,900
- When will you know?
- She's dining with me tonight.

73
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:46,767
- No, she's not.
- No? Why?

74
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,500
Because we're going
on a little trip,
and it's a stag party.

76
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:05,700
Um, excuse me, sir?

77
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:08,633
If it's all the same with you,
I should like to be back for
the 3:00 Saturday.

78
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,800

at Newmarket.
- What do you know?

Gay Gabby.
Should start at any price.
I know a jockey.

80
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:16,100
Never trust a jockey.

81
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,200
You're speaking of
my late profession, sir.

82
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:20,967
You're a bit large for
a jockey, aren't you?

83
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,967
Well, I wasn't exactly
a jockey.

84
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:26,233
I used to lead the horses
around the paddock, and that.

85
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,800
Oh. I'm very sorry, Nobby.

86
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:30,200
Forgiven and forgotten, sir.

87
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:33,500
- Well, how are we?
- Fine.

88
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,233
I had much worse crossings
in the old days.

89
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,233
Yes, seems like a rather
long time ago now, doesn't it?

90
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,067
- How near are we?
- We're pretty near.
Coming up on deck?

91
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:47,067
- Ship's stopped, sir.
- Right.

92
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:51,767
- Cut through the minefield,
all right.
- Good.

93
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:55,700
- You been at this long?
- About a year.

94
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:58,400
- It's a pretty good sport.
- Not for me,
I don't like mines.

95
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:01,200
- I'd be frightened to death.
- You soon get used to it.

96
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:03,200
See that dark shape
over there?

97
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:06,300
- That's France.
- France!

98
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:08,833
I never thought I would
come home like this.

99
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,300
Well, it's as far as
we go, sir.

100

the rest of the way.

101
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:15,933

I thought we'd have to swim
or something.

- Thanks for bringing us.
- I'd do the same for you again
one day, sir.

Hope so.

- Don't hit anything
on the way back.

- Thank you.

an answer?

I'd never rest.

00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:19,600
-Aren't you, Raoul?
- No. Only for 48 hours,
then I have to go.

335
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:20,767
But why?

336
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,933
Well, I'm in
the Free French Army now.

337
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:28,133
- I'm over here for them.
- What for?

338
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,267
To find out about the
German Army, that's all.

339
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,300
You mean you're a spy?

340
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:35,733
Michele!

341
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,100
I'm sorry. I don't know what
I'm trying to say, you see...

342
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:41,300
It's two years
since you were home last.

343
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:43,800
I was so happy
I didn't even think.

344
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,233
You're in danger here.
You might be caught,

345
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,900
Anything might happen.
You must go now, before
morning. Please, Raoul!

346
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:56,133
Women are amazing, I must say.

347
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,167
First, she is angry with me
because I will not stay,

348
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:00,600
And now she tries to throw me
out as quickly as she can.

349
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:03,200
Monsieur, can you not
persuade him to go?

350
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:06,300
No, I'm afraid I can't.

351
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:08,400
You are the only one left.

352
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:11,467
Charles is a prisoner of war
in Germany. His wife is dead.

353
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:14,633
I am here working the estate
with only Violette and
Charles' son to help me.

354
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,500
You do not write to us.
We do not even know
if you're alive.

355
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:21,467
You come to visit us only now
when you wish to do some
spying for your new masters.

357
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,300

you saying it?

go to bed.

359

Monsieur Raoul, come and
help me with the blankets.
Without dropping them, now!

360
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,700
You follow me, monsieur.

361

Things are very difficult
for us here.

365
00:24:18,433 --> 00:24:20,267
You cannot know
what we have suffered.

366
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,233
- The cruelty, the humiliation.
- I think I understand.

367
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,867
I wish we could have met
in happier days.

368
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:27,300
I do, too.

369
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:35,300
- Not that way, stupid!

371
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:41,933
I'm afraid
it is not very elegant.

372
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:44,100
- But I hope you will be safe.
- Thank you.

373

they look like.

Charles is a prisoner, too.
I wonder
if he looks like that.

I wish he were back here to
run this place.

by myself.

But you have done marvelously!
I don't know how.

399

In the old days,
you were always in Paris,
buying dresses.

That is all forgotten now.

401
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:13,267
But, Raoul, listen to me
for a moment.

Does not any of this mean
anything to you at all?

403

This is our land, Raoul.

You cannot go away again
and leave it.

405
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,633
- I have work to do.
- Surely your work is here!

406
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,767
To nurse the land until
the Germans are thrown out.

407
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:30,633
- And be one of
that pathetic group?
- They are prisoners of war.

408

I think I could get you
papers from the Germans.

- You do not face realities,

The Germans will ask you
if you have seen either of us.

But you have not.

We are fighting for France.

have seen us, you will be
fighting for France, too.

- And you would like that,
wouldn't you?
- Yes.

to contribute 30 pieces
of silver.

- You don't know Fayolle.

not to anger the Germans,

Estelle!

501
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:02,233
Sit down, gentlemen, please.

502
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:07,600
This is my daughter.

503
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:10,200
- Bring us some wine.
- (SPEAKING FRENCH)

504
00:33:10,267 --> 00:33:12,900
- So there is still wine
in France.
- Oh, yes.

505
00:33:12,967 --> 00:33:15,067
If you know where to
look for it.

506
00:33:15,133 --> 00:33:16,933
What do you want with me,
gentlemen?

507
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:19,833
We do not have many visitors
these days, do we, Estelle?

508
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,400
- The Germans are
scarcely visitors.
- Germans?

509
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:24,867
Yes.

510
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:28,400
- They come here sometimes.
- Ah, they are our friends.

511
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:32,067
- But you have other friends.
- Oh, not in the village.

512
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,733
They hate us in the village
because we are sensible
and help the Germans.

513
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:40,700
And the Germans need help?

514
00:33:40,767 --> 00:33:43,067
And the Germans need help.

515
00:33:47,867 --> 00:33:50,500
Gentlemen, to our lives.

516
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:53,433
- To a free France.
- ALL: To a free France.

517
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:57,600
Now, gentlemen,
what can I do for you?

518
00:33:57,667 --> 00:34:00,700
Monsieur Fayolle, you've been
very useful to us already.

519
00:34:00,767 --> 00:34:03,933
But there's still one vital
matter on which you can
advise us.

520
00:34:04,067 --> 00:34:06,667
It's obvious that the Germans
are concentrating troops
in this area.

521
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:10,167
Now, we want to find out
their strength, and roughly
their dispositions.

522
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:11,500
Can you help us?

523
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,333
I see.

524
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:20,167
So that if you can only find
the German centers of
resistance and crush them,

525
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:22,367
That will give you the coast.

526
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:24,433
- That's about it.
- Well...

527
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,733
German defenses are
on the box plan,
that is to say...

528
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,133
There is a big box there.

529
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,467
Little box here, little box
there, little box there,
little box there.

530
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:36,833
So that the little boxes
can be reinforced
from the big box.

531
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,200
Yes, but what we want is
more precise information.

532
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:41,833
Their exact strength.

533
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,067
Whether they've got armored
units, if they're using
reservists, and so on.

534
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:48,567
Gentlemen, if you want
the German order of battle,

535
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:50,833
You must go to
German headquarters.

536
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:54,533
German headquarters?

537
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,800
It'd be nice to
pay a call there.

538
00:34:55,867 --> 00:34:57,900
You're not serious, monsieur!

539
00:34:57,967 --> 00:34:59,367
Well, Captain de Carnot
couldn't go, his German's
not good enough,

540
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:00,800
But I don't see
why I shouldn't.

541
00:35:00,867 --> 00:35:02,900
You'd be a brave man to
do that.

542
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,833
- What papers would you need
to get in?
- What papers have you got?

543
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:10,400
There are mine, and these
belong to Captain Gowan,
who's here with us.

544
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:14,433
- Swiss. Forged?
- No, genuine!

545
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,167
The Navy intercepted the ship
on which the two so-called

546
00:35:17,233 --> 00:35:19,100
Swiss gentlemen were
traveling.

547
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:21,100
- Have you passport
photographs?
- Mmm-hmm.

548
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:26,067
Estelle.

549
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:30,133
(SPEAKS FRENCH)

550
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:33,233
Now I will do what I can.

551
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,067
Because I have been sensible
and helped the Germans,

552
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:42,467
Yesterday the military control
gave me a very special pass
to go outside the area.

553
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:43,733
Now...

554
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,533
I cut the potato.

555
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:52,600
I do that.

556
00:35:56,433 --> 00:36:00,100
I do that. You see?
The juice soaks up the ink

557
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:03,867
And makes
a clever sort of stamp.

558
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:08,667
Now remember, you came into
the military area yesterday.

559
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,633
The date is on this stamp.

560
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,400
Do they stop people
and ask them for papers much?

561
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:14,067
Oh, yes.

562
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:16,767
But you will be all right
with this.

563
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:18,600
Thank you.

564
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:22,200
And here are two German
military passes, and
some other papers.

565
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:25,600
- In case you should need them,
you can fill them in.
- Thank you very much.

566
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,333
Oh, that is nothing.

567
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,767
We have passed through
a hundred of your soldiers,
escaped prisoners.

568
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,200
You've done great work,
monsieur.

569
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:36,167
Oh, we have beaten
the Boche before and
we will beat him again.

570
00:36:36,233 --> 00:36:37,533
Certainly, we will.

571
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:43,700
We must go.

572
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:46,667
Oh, by the way, who do I ask
for at German headquarters?

573
00:36:46,733 --> 00:36:49,333
Oh, ask Estelle, she knows
all the German officers.

574
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,333
There's Viktor,
there's Aufdenblatten.

575
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,667
- Perhaps Wiessner
would be the best.
- Wiessner?

576
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:57,367
Yes, Oberst Wiessner.
He's just gone on leave.

577
00:36:57,433 --> 00:36:58,967
That might help you.

578
00:36:59,067 --> 00:37:00,800
I used to know a waiter
called Wiessner.
I hope it's not him.

579
00:37:00,867 --> 00:37:03,533
- Goodbye. Thank you
for all your help.
- Goodbye.

580
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,267
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

- Yes, why?

586
00:37:34,967 --> 00:37:39,667
Because for you, I have a
special cognac which I do not
allow the Boche even to smell.

587
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:43,833
- Don't tell me that's
Mrs. Nobby Clark?
- Yes.

588
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,600
I can understand how
the Boche beat some
of the French men,

589
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:48,800

how they beat the women.

- Oh, he is very naughty,
but I love him.

- How is Nobby?
- He'll never be
the same again.

- How'd you get on?
- Not bad.

598

I got some information,
but it's incomplete.

I can get some more.

- Never mind, I'll take you

and private soon.

- German headquarters.

- Through the door.

what you are doing
in a military area

Without a proper
military escort.

651

- Is that necessary?
- Of course it's necessary!

652
00:41:29,533 --> 00:41:33,067
I don't understand
how you got through
our controls without one.

653
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,167
In Berlin, they said
this would be sufficient.

This is a military area.

let civilians roam about
in it at will.

perhaps you'll send us to
someone who has.

- Yes, I will see them.
- Thank you.

(BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN)

667
00:42:22,067 --> 00:42:25,067
Take these two gentlemen
to Major Lang.

668
00:42:25,067 --> 00:42:27,100
I am at your service,
gentlemen.

669
00:42:38,933 --> 00:42:40,800
I'm beginning to like it
around here.

Good morning, gentlemen.

674
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,633
Major Lang.

675
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:11,800
This is Hauptmann Grune.

676
00:43:12,933 --> 00:43:14,967
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

677
00:43:19,367 --> 00:43:22,367
- Well, what can we do for you?
- Herr Major,

678
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,300
I have a message for
Oberst Wiessner from
Herr von Ribbentrop.

679
00:43:25,367 --> 00:43:27,833
I'm afraid Oberst Wiessner
is on leave.

680
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,467
I'm his deputy.

681
00:43:29,533 --> 00:43:31,700
Is there anything I can do
to help you?

682
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:34,567
Can I speak confidentially?

683
00:43:34,633 --> 00:43:36,867
Oh, yes, certainly.

684
00:43:36,933 --> 00:43:40,133
My partner and I happen to be
in the same business
as Herr von Ribbentrop.

685
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,300
Oh, I see. You mean, you are
members of the foreign office?

686
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:45,833
No, no, no, I mean his real
business, champagne merchant.

687
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,933
Oh, champagne.

688
00:43:49,067 --> 00:43:50,133
I see.

689
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,133
And strictly
between ourselves,

He has an interest
in our business.

Purely fatherly interest,
of course.

692
00:43:58,167 --> 00:43:59,833
Oh, yes, yes, yes, of course.

693
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,867
And so, at his suggestion,
we are trying to make
arrangements to supply

694
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:05,767
The officers
of the German Army
with our champagne.

695
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:08,633
Most of it was confiscated
when France was occupied.

you, but our mess secretary
will tell you that

Just at the present,
our mess funds are rather low.

- Well, so are our prices.

Would you care to try
a bottle?

703

Well, I won't say no.

704
00:44:34,933 --> 00:44:37,367
And I don't suppose you will,
Grune.

705
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,567
Thank you.

706
00:44:41,633 --> 00:44:44,067
I'll put it on ice and
fetch some glasses.

- Smart fellow, that.
- He's a regular soldier.

- Aren't you?
- No, I am only a reservist.

709

I am here because of
my language qualifications.

I am an authority on America.

Yes?

716
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,367
Yes, Excellency.

717
00:45:16,433 --> 00:45:18,267
No, he's away.

718
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:21,067
Major Lang has gone out of
the room for a moment.

719
00:45:21,067 --> 00:45:23,267
Yes, Excellency. At once.

720
00:45:34,867 --> 00:45:37,467
That was the General,
he wants to see me at once.

721
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:39,200
He's in a very bad temper.

722
00:45:39,267 --> 00:45:41,933
Excuse me just a moment,
please.

PETER: By the way,
who is the General?

724
00:45:44,067 --> 00:45:45,633
Von Reichman, of course.

725
00:45:47,567 --> 00:45:49,167
Von Reichman.

726
00:45:49,233 --> 00:45:50,667
- Watch the door.
- What's the idea?

727
00:45:50,733 --> 00:45:52,133
Don't argue. Watch the door.

728
00:46:12,067 --> 00:46:13,100

729
00:46:15,833 --> 00:46:17,100

Oh, here's Grune now.

731
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,667
Well, what was your
impression?

732
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:38,433
- Of what?
- Of the two men, of course.

733
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,067
- I don't know...
- Do you think they're genuine
champagne merchants?

734
00:46:44,367 --> 00:46:45,800
I did.

735
00:46:45,867 --> 00:46:49,067
From what you tell me,
it's quite obvious
they are not.

736
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,133
- Anyway, the champagne
looks too good.
- And the talks are wrong.

737
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,500
- Yes.
- Well, then who are they?

738
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:56,967
Either Gestapo or
a counter-espionage.

739
00:46:57,067 --> 00:46:59,667
Nosing around for something,
obviously.

740
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:02,433
Well, they won't get anything
out of us.

741
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,600
They better not.

00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:09,067
Quite a few generals have been
purged lately, haven't they?

00:47:09,067 --> 00:47:12,100
- Anyway, you better
get back quick.
- Yes, Excellency.

- And remember,
keep your mouth shut.
- Yes, Excellency.

their strength from this
immediately,

748

waiting.

- Cigarette?

miniatures, too.

- Really? Would you like to
look at them?
- Yes. Yes, I would.

- That cigarette you
gave him...
- What about it?

760
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:12,333
- It's English.
- Blimey.

761
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,200
Look.

762
00:48:17,267 --> 00:48:19,967
- They're beautiful,
aren't they?
- Remarkable.

763
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:26,933

00:48:27,733 --> 00:48:28,833
Yes.

Well, where do you
get them from?

766

smokes anything else.

00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:36,767
Have a packet.

has expressed

- Heil Hitler.
- Heil.

- Oh, the poor boy.

Poor boy,
what was he crying about?

780

Well, how would you like to be
going to Russia?

781
00:49:27,867 --> 00:49:30,400
- I wouldn't,
not if I was a German.
- Well, there you are.

782
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,833
He is being transferred,
and he likes it here.

783
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,667
He says that he feels safe
because the aerodrome where
he works is underground

784
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:38,667
And safe from British bombers.

785
00:49:40,867 --> 00:49:42,633
He didn't say the whereabouts
of this drome, did he?

786
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,333
No, just cried and cried
and cried.

787
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,067
Go on,
you're breaking my heart.

give us.

have your fair share,
you know.

in your mess?

- Thirty-five.
- Thirty-five, make a note
of that, would you?

797
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,467
- That means we can let you
have 12 dozen to start.
- Excellent.

Danish beer, which the men
rather like.

Excellent, we will buy that,
too.

in this area?

00:50:42,467 --> 00:50:45,433
Newspapers are reporting
a lot of landings
on this part of the coast.

809

Oh, you mustn't believe
everything you read in
the Berlin newspapers.

have been no British landings
here at all, is that true?

we captured a British.

But I can tell you this,
if it wasn't for my
determination and willpower,

817
00:51:06,267 --> 00:51:09,867
The population would soon
get out of hand, they're
always trying sabotage.

818

Only I make them pay for it,
you can be sure!

819
00:51:13,367 --> 00:51:15,500
- (CHUCKLES)
- Yes, I'm pretty sure of that.

820
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:17,133
Well, I'm afraid
we must be going.

821
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,900
Would you like
a military escort?

00:51:20,633 --> 00:51:23,233
- No, I don't think so,
thank you.
- Quite sure?

823

Quite sure, thank you.

824

You won't forget to send
the champagne?

825

No, Excellency,
you shall have it next week.

826

- Goodbye, many thanks.
- Thanks to you.

827
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:33,900
We shall have much pleasure
in telling Herr von Ribbentrop
about our visit.

828
00:51:33,967 --> 00:51:36,133
- Good, give him my regards.
- I will indeed.

I told you, if you stay here,
I will turn you over
to the German soldiers.

Good evening, mademoiselle.

1167
01:15:24,067 --> 01:15:26,367
I've come to ask you if you
happen to have seen two men

1168

Who are believed to be
in this neighborhood.

I'll have a little look
around.

01:15:52,067 --> 01:15:54,133
I thought I heard voices.

01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,700
- Yes?
- Yes.

1173
01:15:57,767 --> 01:16:00,200
Oh, there's something else
I want to ask you.

1174
01:16:00,267 --> 01:16:02,700
We are a bit overcrowded
in our headquarters.

1175
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:07,733
We have so many troops,
and the General wishes you to
take 12 officers here.

1176
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,067
Kindly see that their rooms
are prepared.

- He is not here.
- But I know he is here.

he is not here anymore.

for the same cause.

Your brother, and ourselves.

I hoped we wouldn't
have to tell you.

for a second.

Mademoiselle,
you must believe us.

What you have just heard
might mean death to
both of us.

That all this time, you've
been working against
the Germans?

You've been despised by us.
Insulted.

- And all along...
- Oh, there was so little that
we could do.

than that.

Yes.

And I thought...

1213
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:53,167
Mademoiselle, it is urgent
that we warn the others.

1214
01:19:53,233 --> 01:19:55,167
The Germans are patrolling
everywhere.

1215
01:19:55,233 --> 01:19:58,867
- They are going to patrol
the woods tonight.
- This is awful.

- They were both here
a short time ago, but...
- Where are they now?

I'm not sure.
But I must find them!

Thank you, mademoiselle.

all alike to me, we must
be getting somewhere.

- What are you doing here?
- I've come to show you
the tree.

- Is this some kind of trap?
- Oh, no! No, no!

What are you doing here?

1226
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,800
Fayolle came to see me.
He told me everything.

1227
01:20:55,867 --> 01:20:59,300
I feel so ashamed,
I was thinking only for
myself.

1228
01:20:59,367 --> 01:21:01,133
Oh, Peter.

1229
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,400

Forgive you? Oh, my darling.

- I'll show you.
It's quite near.

don't you, Peter?

splendid. We always knew
it might end like this.

- Do not talk. Follow me.

I can take care of them,
I just can't switch off
this blasted music.

01:21:55,067 --> 01:21:57,867
Come on over, you two.
Come on over before I do you!

1248
01:21:57,933 --> 01:22:00,400
Nice night, miss.
Come on, keep them hands up.

1249
01:22:00,467 --> 01:22:01,800
Nobby's the name, miss.

01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:07,200
Excuse me, sir. With the
compliments of the missus.

I think this ought to
do the lady good.

Now tell us how you got hold
of the music box.

1253

Well, sir, I've been feeling
very angry

1254
01:22:12,067 --> 01:22:14,100
Ever since I heard what they
done to Captain de Carnot.

1255
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:16,233
And a short while back,
I come across the crew

1256
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:19,067
Standing peacefully
by the side of the road,
reading a map. It was easy.

- Easy?

That gives us just over
an hour before
our bomber boys come in.

1262
01:22:29,633 --> 01:22:30,833
If they come.

1263
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:32,267
Course they'll come.
Hey, wait a minute,

1264
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:34,200
This fellow's about my size.
Give me a hand with him,
will you?

1265
01:22:34,267 --> 01:22:35,800
All right, sir,
what's the idea?

1266
01:22:41,367 --> 01:22:43,400
What are you going to do now?

1267
01:22:43,467 --> 01:22:45,533
Something useful, I hope.

1268
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,700
- You are not going to
risk your life again.
- Of course not, Michele.

- I'll be back
as soon as I can.

If I'm not back in an hour,
carry on.

- You've got the photographs
and things?
- Yes, sir.

1275
01:23:00,667 --> 01:23:02,833
Michele will show you
the exact spot
where to guide them in.

1276

When you've done that,
slip over to the other map
reference.

1277

Right.

Be careful, Peter. Please.

01:23:08,533 --> 01:23:09,933
Please, for me.

1280
01:23:14,833 --> 01:23:16,867
- Any music, sir?
- Yes, as loud as you'd like.

a jolly good guess.

Excuse me, sir.

1288
01:23:46,633 --> 01:23:49,167
- Isn't this the way to the
German headquarters?
- Mmm-hmm.

1289
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:51,267
As near as
makes no difference.

1290
01:23:51,333 --> 01:23:53,100
Yes, I thought it might be.

1291
01:24:09,767 --> 01:24:11,900
- Casualty?
- No, I want to see
the officer in charge.

1292

- He's asleep, Sergeant.
- Well, I must see somebody.

1293
01:24:14,433 --> 01:24:16,633
- There's a duty officer.
- Well, take me to him.

1294
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,167
Please come with me.

1295
01:24:21,867 --> 01:24:24,233
- What do you want?
- Message from headquarters,
Herr Oberleutnant.

1296
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:35,100
What does this mean?

1297
01:24:35,167 --> 01:24:37,933
The General wants the prisoner
you have sent to him
immediately.

1298
01:24:38,067 --> 01:24:39,433
Hasn't he been punished
enough?

1299
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,733
Those are my orders from
Oberst Wiessner.

1300
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,733
Well, it's most irregular.

1301
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,733
- Why didn't Oberst Wiessner
telephone?
- The wires are cut.

1302
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,467
- What, again?
- Yes, Herr Oberleutnant.

1303
01:24:49,533 --> 01:24:51,667
Oberst Wiessner said
he'd return the prisoner
in the morning

1304
01:24:52,967 --> 01:24:55,267
If he's still alive.

1305
01:24:55,333 --> 01:24:58,167
Do you happen to know
why they want this man
in such a hurry?

1306
01:24:58,233 --> 01:25:00,433
The two men waiting for the
British have been captured.

1307
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:03,600
The General wants to face them
with the prisoner while
their nerves are still bad.

1308
01:25:05,167 --> 01:25:06,433
Wait for me here.

1309
01:25:13,767 --> 01:25:16,067
Dash, dot, dot, dot, dash,

1310
01:25:16,067 --> 01:25:18,500
Dot, dash, dot.
You go on like that. Got it?

1311
01:25:18,567 --> 01:25:20,067
Dash, dot, dot...

1312
01:25:27,433 --> 01:25:29,733
Well, Sergeant,
here is your man.

1313
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,233
Will you sign for him?

1314
01:25:33,833 --> 01:25:35,933
This is very irregular.

1315
01:25:36,067 --> 01:25:38,767
- Please see he is brought back
here as soon as possible.
- Yes, Herr Oberleutnant.

1316
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:40,600
The orderly will help you
with this man.

1317
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:47,633
Hurry.

1318
01:25:55,833 --> 01:25:59,233
- How do you feel?
- I'm fine. Now.

1319
01:26:03,733 --> 01:26:07,067
Not bad, eh?
Transport provided by
the German Army.

I'm coming at once.

1325
01:26:30,167 --> 01:26:31,867
Give me co-headquarters!

1326
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:36,900
Korr? Put me through to
Oberst Wiessner.

1327
01:26:36,967 --> 01:26:38,567
What's that?

1328
01:26:38,633 --> 01:26:40,067
He is not back yet.

1329
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,767
Well, someone in his office.

1330
01:26:42,367 --> 01:26:43,967
Hmm?

1331
01:26:44,067 --> 01:26:46,200
They're all in bed
except the duty officer.

1332
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,233
Wait!

1333
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:52,133
Tell me, have the wires been
cut tonight?

1334
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,533
They haven't?

1335
01:26:57,067 --> 01:26:58,300
Give me the guard room!

1336
01:27:04,667 --> 01:27:05,933
3:10.

1337
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:08,733
First light coming up.

1338
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,233
I wish he would come back.

1339
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:11,933
Yes, I'd be pleased to
see him.

1340
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:22,567
Came the dawn.

1341
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:25,967
We'll leave the car here.
If we take it any further,

1342
01:27:26,067 --> 01:27:27,733
We lead Jerry straight to
our rendezvous.

1343
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,167
- Think you manage
a few hundred yards?
- Eh, I can manage ten miles.

1344
01:27:30,233 --> 01:27:31,633
- Lend me a hand, Nobby.
- I'll tell you what, sir.

1345
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,800
I'll drive the car on a bit,
and leave it peacefully
in a ditch.

1346
01:27:33,867 --> 01:27:35,500
That'll draw the chase away
from you.

1347
01:27:35,567 --> 01:27:37,933
- What makes you think
they're going to chase us?
- They're chasing you now, sir.

1348
01:27:38,067 --> 01:27:39,933
-(VEHICLES APPROACHING)
- How do you get back to
the beach?

1349
01:27:40,067 --> 01:27:42,633
Oh, I know the country like
the back of me hand, sir.
I'll meet you down the beach.

1350
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:44,433
- If you can get away with it.
- I'll get away with it, sir.

1351
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:45,767
Goodbye, good luck.
See you later.

1352
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,233
I can't see any signal.

1353
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:14,633
There it is, sir!

1354
01:28:21,967 --> 01:28:23,533
(ALL SHOUTING)

1355
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,067
See you down there, chaps.

1356
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,500
Here they come!

1357
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:04,667
Our job's over.

1358
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:17,667
- Is everything all right?
- I've got some Jerries for you
over there.

1359
01:29:17,733 --> 01:29:20,367
That's fine, I'll take care
of them. Sergeant, you know
what to do with them.

1360
01:29:20,433 --> 01:29:22,233
Yes, sir. Come on,
press on, men.

1361
01:29:25,567 --> 01:29:28,367
- Right, well, I'll hand over.
- Right.

1362
01:29:28,433 --> 01:29:30,067
Come along, we must go
down to the beach.

1363
01:29:30,133 --> 01:29:32,233
- We've got to get there
before they come back.
- But Peter...

1364
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:34,067
We'll see him on the beach,
come on.

1365
01:30:01,267 --> 01:30:03,000
(GUNFIRE)

1366
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,000
The English are here!

1367
01:30:32,833 --> 01:30:34,633
Come on, get ready!
To the boats!

1368
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:37,133
Retreat to the boats!

1369
01:30:50,567 --> 01:30:53,200
- That's music to my ears.
- NOBBY: Sir?

1370
01:30:53,267 --> 01:30:55,733
- Sir, all present
and correct, sir.
- Where's Major Garnett?

1371
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,067
I had to leave him behind,
sir.

1372
01:30:57,133 --> 01:30:58,600
Something's happened to him.

1373
01:30:58,667 --> 01:31:00,533
- I feel it.
- Take it easy.

1374
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,267
Don't worry, miss.
He'll be along in a minute.

1375
01:31:02,333 --> 01:31:05,133
- Here, put that on,
you look like a German.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

1376
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:08,133
- Only a few more yards.
- Yeah, I'm enjoying
the stroll.

1377
01:31:08,767 --> 01:31:09,933
Peter!

1378
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:14,433
Thank heavens you're safe!

1379
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,900
- Everything all right?
- Now you're here,
everything's fine.

1380
01:31:16,967 --> 01:31:18,633
- This is Mackenzie.
- How do you do?
-Hello!

1381
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:20,300
The boys are certainly doing
a good job, aren't they?

1382
01:31:20,367 --> 01:31:22,067
Yeah, and tonight's raid
won't be the last.

1383
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:25,067
We'll go on hitting them
again and again,
then some more.

1384
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:27,267
We'll show those Huns.
We'll give 'em war.

1385
01:31:27,333 --> 01:31:28,700
Excuse me, sir,
you better come with me.

1386
01:31:28,767 --> 01:31:31,300
The boat's not far away,
just a hop, skip and a jump.

1387
01:31:31,367 --> 01:31:34,433
- I beg your pardon.
-(LAUGHING)
That's all right with me.

1388
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:36,067
The call signal's
just gone up.

1389
01:31:38,633 --> 01:31:40,733
We'll make them pay
for Raoul, Michele.

1390
01:31:46,433 --> 01:31:49,367
- We'd better hurry.
- I'm not coming with you.

1391
01:31:49,433 --> 01:31:50,700
I'm staying here.

1392
01:31:51,633 --> 01:31:53,067
Are you crazy?

1393
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:56,067
Peter, if you and Raoul can
do all that you have done,

1394
01:31:56,133 --> 01:31:58,100
I can do a little, too.

1395
01:31:58,167 --> 01:32:00,067
Rene needs me,
so does Violette,

1396
01:32:00,133 --> 01:32:02,967
And tomorrow there will be
German soldiers billeted
at the chateau.

1397
01:32:03,067 --> 01:32:04,467
I can be very useful.

1398
01:32:05,767 --> 01:32:07,400
Michele, my darling.

1399
01:32:07,467 --> 01:32:08,833
RED: Come on, you two!

1400
01:32:12,533 --> 01:32:13,933
Go along, Peter.

1401
01:32:22,067 --> 01:32:24,600
This will bring you safety.

1402
01:32:26,067 --> 01:32:27,567
SOLDIER: Come on, boys!

1403
01:32:37,667 --> 01:32:39,067
Goodbye, Michele.

1404
01:32:41,433 --> 01:32:42,767
Au revoir.

1405
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:45,733
Peter.

1406
01:33:17,533 --> 01:33:19,467
