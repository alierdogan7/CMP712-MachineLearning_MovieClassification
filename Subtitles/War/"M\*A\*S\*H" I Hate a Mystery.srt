00:00:54,845 --> 00:00:57,040
[Thinking]
Staff duty log, 13 June...

2
00:00:57,114 --> 00:01:01,050
Corporal Walter O'Reilly,
company clerk, 0600 hours.

3
00:01:01,118 --> 00:01:04,485
The friendly old sun showed
his friendly hot face...

4
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:07,217
<i>over the mountains</i>
<i>of purple majesty...</i>

5
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:11,022
<i>as though he was salutating,</i>
<i>"Good morning to all."</i>

6
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:14,758
<i>Alas, alack, the peaceful</i>
<i>quietness was detonated...</i>

7
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:18,632
<i>by a herd of chopper</i>
<i>transporti</i>z<i>ing punctured personnel.</i>

8
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:22,001
<i>But our gallant doctors,</i>
<i>the miracle medical mortals...</i>

9
00:01:22,072 --> 00:01:24,540
<i>are ever ready</i>
<i>to treat the sick.</i>

10
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:25,823
<i>The wounded were aided copiously</i>
<i>by super-smart surgeons...</i>

11
00:01:25,823 --> 00:01:27,723
<i>The wounded were aided copiously</i>
<i>by super-smart surgeons...</i>

12
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:32,456
<i>whose knowledge is superseded</i>
<i>by nobody I know.</i>

13
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,657
<i>Together or apart,</i>
<i>they work as a team.</i>

14
00:01:34,732 --> 00:01:36,825
<i>Skilled hands</i>
<i>with their fingers...</i>

15
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:40,962
<i>work dedicatedly to keep death</i>
<i>away from its maximum.</i>

16
00:01:41,038 --> 00:01:43,905
- <i>Radar, what is this cow flubdubbery?</i>
- Sir?

17
00:01:43,974 --> 00:01:47,637
All this "miracle medical mortals" hooey.
What are you doin' to my duty log?

18
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:50,976
I was just adding a hint
of self-expression, sir.

19
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:55,007
Better fill me in, son,
and use simple sentences.

20
00:01:55,085 --> 00:01:57,713
Well, sir,
I've been accepted...

21
00:01:57,788 --> 00:02:00,723
by the famous
Las Vegas Writers' School.

22
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:04,022
"Serving the creative
community since 1950."

23
00:02:04,094 --> 00:02:06,119
- Right.
- How'd you stumble onto this?

24
00:02:06,197 --> 00:02:08,131
- Superman, sir.
- He take the course?

25
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,292
No, sir. On the back
of his comic book.

26
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:12,733
See, right next to the ad
for the X-ray glasses?

27
00:02:12,803 --> 00:02:15,033
I sent 'em in an example
of my writings...

28
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:18,268
and they said that I had
"extraordinary potential."

29
00:02:18,342 --> 00:02:21,641
- How much they stick you for?
- Just $50...

30
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:24,613
plus a five-dollar student activity fee,
but it's really worth it.

31
00:02:24,682 --> 00:02:29,176
They show you all the writers' secrets, like
verbs and semicolons and all that good stuff.

32
00:02:29,253 --> 00:02:31,721
Sounds like the original
shell game to me.

33
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:33,882
Oh, no, it's no game, sir.

34
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:39,055
This school is run by some very famous writers
like Hemingway and Steinbeck and O'Neill.

35
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:42,189
"Ethel Hemingway, Jerry Steinbeck,
Eunice O'Neill."

36
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:44,200
- Right.
- Uh-huh.

37
00:02:44,268 --> 00:02:46,600
Look at page three.

38
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,606
"Writers are special people.
In a crowd, they are glib and articulate.

39
00:02:50,674 --> 00:02:53,165
Everyone respects the man
who writes well."

40
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:57,340
Can you imagine, sir? In just 10 weeks,
I can be respected by a crowd.

41
00:02:57,414 --> 00:02:59,609
An admirable goal, Radar.

42
00:02:59,683 --> 00:03:01,913
But the army doesn't need
creative writing.

43
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:04,716
- Save it for your novel.
- Thank you, sir.

44
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:08,918
- I'll dedicate my first book after you.
- Better let me read it first.

45
00:03:14,064 --> 00:03:16,498
Ah, foot fault! Your foot left the court.
You don't get the point.

46
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:19,900
- It never touched the floor.
- Come on, Pancho. I saw it hit.

47
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,404
- What's the difference?
- I'm gonna get a ruling on this.

48
00:03:22,473 --> 00:03:25,670
Frank, did you see
his foot leave the bunk?

49
00:03:25,743 --> 00:03:28,473
- Earth calling Major Burns.
- You want something, Pierce?

50
00:03:28,546 --> 00:03:32,141
- What's so absorbing, Junior?
- It's an interesting article about Sweden.

51
00:03:32,216 --> 00:03:36,585
- Learning to be a meatball?
- I'm reading about their rising suicide rate.

52
00:03:36,654 --> 00:03:39,646
- Just killing time?
- Go peddle your petunias.

53
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:41,714
Here. You ready
for my killer serve?

54
00:03:41,792 --> 00:03:45,250
- This has been clocked
at over five miles an hour.
- Lay it on me.

55
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,188
Twenty-one!
On to Wimbledon!

56
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:53,828
I'm... This must be the press
asking me how it feels to be a winner.

57
00:03:53,904 --> 00:03:56,270
- Go ahead. Ask me how it feels.
- How do you feel, sir?

58
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,865
What a stupid question.
Cancel the interview.

59
00:03:58,943 --> 00:04:01,673
- Actually, I come in here
to ask you two guys a favor.
- What is it, Radar?

60
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:05,681
Well, uh, you see, I, uh... I found
this real neat way to improve myself.

61
00:04:05,749 --> 00:04:08,217
- Don't change a hair for me.
- Not if you care for me.

62
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,310
I enrolled in this
writers' school by mail.

63
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:13,879
- They send you tiny teachers
in little envelopes?
- For short stories?

64
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,688
Come on, guys. I'm having trouble
with my first assignment.

65
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,197
I have to relate an amusing anecdote,
and I don't think I ever had an anecdote.

66
00:04:21,265 --> 00:04:24,166
- Not even a small one?
- I have some in my footlocker.
What size do you wear?

67
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:28,068
- Come on. Will ya?
- I got an amusing anecdote,
but promise you won't laugh.

68
00:04:28,138 --> 00:04:30,732
Okay, fine.
Yeah, good. Here.

69
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:33,174
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

70
00:04:33,243 --> 00:04:35,803
- This happened while I was in
my first year of medical school.
- Right.

71
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,508
I was taking an exam in anatomy.
It was really tough.

72
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,017
They asked questions like,
"How many bones are there in the hand?"

73
00:04:42,086 --> 00:04:45,920
I was stymied. I kept saying to myself,
"How many bones are there in the hand?"

74
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,858
And then I heard this little voice
that said, "Twenty-four."

75
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:53,158
I looked around the room, and
there sitting over on the windowsill...

76
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,496
was this little gray squirrel
with a very intelligent face.

77
00:04:57,568 --> 00:05:02,232
And he pointed at his hand,
and he said, "Twenty-four."

78
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:06,367
So I wrote it down. Then after the exam,
I rushed over to the library to look it up.

79
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:10,311
And would you believe it?
That stupid squirrel was wrong by four bones!

80
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:13,077
I went looking all over the campus for him.
I wanted to kill him.

81
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,313
And I finally found him over on a bench
by the psych department.

82
00:05:16,387 --> 00:05:20,483
"You were wrong!" I screamed at him.
"There's 28 bones in the human hand!"

83
00:05:20,557 --> 00:05:22,491
"Oh," he said,
pointing at his hand.

84
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,255
"I thought you meant
a squirrel's hand."

85
00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:29,192
I don't think I can use
that story.

86
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:32,201
Do you want me
to make one up?

87
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:34,533
Frank, help us out.
We need a funny anecdote.

88
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:38,302
- I don't feel very funny.
- Aw, come on. Be a pal.

89
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:42,038
- Please, sir? Would you, please?
- Well... [Chuckles]

90
00:05:42,112 --> 00:05:45,138
There's one that always
breaks me up.

91
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:48,776
Seems we had this little sickly kid
that lived on our block named Timmy.

92
00:05:48,852 --> 00:05:53,186
He used to sit out on his porch in his
wheelchair and wave at us as we walked by.

93
00:05:53,257 --> 00:05:56,226
Sort of...
Well, one day...

94
00:05:56,293 --> 00:06:00,059
while he was waving,
he lost control of his chair...

95
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,122
and it rolled down the stairs,
across the lawn...

96
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,499
and crashed into
my dad's car.

97
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,936
Boy, was that funny!

98
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:13,067
- That must have been awful.
- No, just scratched the paint a little.

99
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:18,581
- I hope Timmy wasn't hurt.
- What's the difference?
His folks had money.

100
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:21,584
<i>Frank, that was not</i>
<i>an amusing anecdote.</i>

101
00:06:21,652 --> 00:06:24,917
You guys have got
no sense of humor.

102
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:28,287
All you know how to do is pick, pick, pick.
Is there anything I can do to please you?

103
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:32,124
- Tap dance in the minefield.
- Drop yourself on North Korea.

104
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:35,597
Oh, fish. That's the last time
I tell a joke to you guys.

105
00:06:39,403 --> 00:06:43,134
Maybe I should just go
to assignment number two.

106
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:47,439
Let's see. Uh, "Describe a beautiful scene
outside your window."

107
00:06:51,982 --> 00:06:56,043
- Maybe assignment number three.
- Radar, why the sudden interest
in creative writing?

108
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,612
Oh, I need it. You see,
more and more, a man is judged...

109
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,386
by how good
he expresses himself.

110
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:05,223
- Where'd you get that?
- Page five.

111
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:09,197
What do you mean you're out of tapioca
pudding? I saw some enlisted men eating some!

112
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:11,666
That's why we're out, Major.
They ate it all.

113
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:15,068
Well, it's not fair. You run this place
like a bunch of babies.

114
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:19,007
- I'm sorry.
- Well, you should be. It's my birthday.

115
00:07:19,076 --> 00:07:21,636
And I always have
tapioca pudding on my birthday.

116
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:23,680
How was I supposed to know?

117
00:07:23,747 --> 00:07:27,080
- Well, you could have asked.
- Happy birthday, Major.

118
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:30,279
Never mind. You spoiled it for me.
And I hope you're satisfied.

119
00:07:30,354 --> 00:07:33,653
Would you like
an extra hunk of liver?

120
00:07:36,326 --> 00:07:38,658
Soldier, I'm confiscating
this tapioca.

121
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:40,663
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, sir.

122
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:44,189
Don't threaten me.
Mmm, with raisins.

123
00:07:44,268 --> 00:07:46,930
No, sir. Flies.

124
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:53,135
Some birthday
this turned out to be.

125
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,474
Why, Frank, you didn't
tell us it was your birthday.

126
00:07:55,546 --> 00:07:57,810
It's not important.
What's the difference? Nobody cares.

127
00:07:57,881 --> 00:08:01,044
You're being too hard on yourself, Frank.
Here, I'll prove it to you.

128
00:08:01,118 --> 00:08:04,884
Hey, everybody, guess what.
Today's Major Burns's birthday.

129
00:08:06,256 --> 00:08:08,190
- See?
- They're delighted.

130
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:11,489
- Birthdays are hell.
- So are wars, but we keep on
celebrating them every year.

131
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:14,588
Who cares about wars?
This really hurts.

132
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,791
Maybe we should take up a collection
and get him a gift.

133
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:20,803
What can you buy
for a dime?

134
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:24,799
I know, I know.
Everything looks so good.

135
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:29,608
- What'll you have?
- I'll have a modicum of hash
and a smattering of potatoes.

136
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,582
- You been out in the sun again?
- No. I'm adding muscle to my vocabulary.

137
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,881
- I'm taking this correspondence course
by mail.
- Oh, yeah?

138
00:08:36,954 --> 00:08:40,549
These mail things are great.
My friend Vito met his wife that way.

139
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:44,219
- She was a pen pal?
- No. She was a mailman.

140
00:08:44,294 --> 00:08:48,924
- What a provocative anecdote.
- Watch your mouth!

141
00:08:55,806 --> 00:08:58,639
Uh, Father, excuse me.
Do you mind if I sit here?

142
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:01,007
Certainly not, Radar.

143
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:04,309
Father, do you have
a most unforgettable character?

144
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:07,578
- Oh, your writing class, eh?
- Yes, sir.

145
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:11,451
Well, without a doubt, I'd have
to name my sister, Sister Theresa.

146
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:13,716
She's a Benedictine
in San Diego.

147
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,384
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that, sir.

148
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,293
Oh, no. She teaches
in the seminary there.

149
00:09:19,363 --> 00:09:22,264
She also plays guard
on their basketball team.

150
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:26,200
You know, she can slam dunk
while wearing a heavy crucifix.

151
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,830
Oh, now we're
getting somewhere!

152
00:09:28,906 --> 00:09:31,875
This used to be the most important day
of the year for me.

153
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:35,969
I looked forward to it for months.
There used to be parties in my honor.

154
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:38,810
Cards, gifts and...

155
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:44,587
What do I get around here, huh?
Nothing.

156
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:48,056
Nada. Zilch. Zippo.
The big goose egg.

157
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,583
And look at you. You got a Purple Heart,
and it's not even your birthday.

158
00:10:00,604 --> 00:10:04,131
What is it?
What do you want?

159
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:06,175
- Nothing, Frank.
- We came to work.

160
00:10:06,243 --> 00:10:09,269
- Oh, sure. Came in to spy on me.
- We came to relieve you.

161
00:10:09,346 --> 00:10:14,079
I didn't do anything wrong. And you
keep your hands off his Purple Heart!

162
00:10:14,151 --> 00:10:16,346
And that was one
of his more lucid moments.

163
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,718
Why don't we shoot him
and put him out of our misery?

164
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:22,384
- That or just find something
to lift his spirits.
- Call off the peace talks.

165
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:24,950
Have Margaret's fiance transferred
to the European theater.

166
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:26,928
Get him a seat
in the balcony.

167
00:10:27,064 --> 00:10:29,498
You and I could have a fight
and beat each other's brains out.

168
00:10:29,566 --> 00:10:31,966
- Frank would love that.
- Right.

169
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:36,438
That would give Frank instant joy,
to see us at each other's throats.

170
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:40,636
- Let's do it.
- It is the perfect gift
for the man who has nothing.

171
00:10:40,711 --> 00:10:42,804
We'd have to be
pretty convincing.

172
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,370
It's easy to fake a fight
with a jerk like you.

173
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:48,475
Nah. Who'd believe I couldn't take
a noodle like you out with one punch?

174
00:10:48,552 --> 00:10:53,080
- Maybe you ought to fight Radar.
- This is gonna be the best
birthday of Frank's whole life.

175
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:04,612
I don't wanna hear about it! I gave you
your assignment, and that's that!

176
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:07,275
- Why don't you work the shift with me?
- Because I'm chief surgeon.

177
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,818
- If you don't like it, join another army.
- What's going on, fellas?

178
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:12,377
It's a good thing we're friends.
Otherwise, you'd have me on duty 24 hours.

179
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:15,219
- That can be arranged, buster.
- This isn't a fight, is it?

180
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:18,352
- Don't turn your back on me.
- How you gonna work
with your nose in a sling?

181
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,124
- Boys, easy.
- I'm not working the shift alone, Pierce!

182
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:25,328
- I'm gonna let Frank decide.
- Leave me out of it. I like the
way you guys are working it out.

183
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:29,099
- I'm gonna see what the colonel
has to say about this.
- Oh, sure, the colonel.

184
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:34,275
- Wow, you guys are really
mad at each other.
- You think you know a guy.

185
00:11:34,344 --> 00:11:36,574
- All of a sudden, he pulls rank.
- What a shame.

186
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:39,615
- Some friend. The guy's a two-faced rat!
- That's pretty strong.

187
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:41,651
- How would you put it?
- Well, maybe you're right.

188
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:45,882
He's so competitive, so childish.
Always has to come out on top,
get in the last word.

189
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,151
- I know. Impossible.
- He's impossible!

190
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:51,194
Here he comes. Let's pretend
we're talking about him, okay?

191
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:54,128
You're lucky, Hunnicutt.
Potter's taking a nap.

192
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:57,428
Forget it. I'd rather work the shift
alone than be stuck in here with you!

193
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,663
You... The air feels better
in here already!

194
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,972
Don't you wanna tell Potter?
Wake him up. He won't mind.

195
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:13,641
- Don't worry. That lazy crumb will get his.
- I'll be a witness.

196
00:12:13,717 --> 00:12:15,981
- I'll bet he called me
every name in the book.
- Let's see.

197
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:19,579
Two-faced, rat fink
and, uh, ferret face.

198
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:23,558
- He called me ferret face?
- He was so mad, he thought you were me.

199
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:26,221
- That's his style.
- He called you a sore loser.

200
00:12:26,296 --> 00:12:28,321
- Sore loser?
- He thinks you're too competitive.

201
00:12:28,398 --> 00:12:32,732
You know, hate to lose, always have
to get in the last word, childish.

202
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:35,100
- He said that?
- Yeah, every syllable.

203
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,731
But you didn't
hear it from me.

204
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:40,071
Boy, he must really
be desperate.

205
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:43,944
That is so dumb,
it's ridiculous.

206
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:48,349
- I hate to lose? He said that?
- Uh-huh.

207
00:12:56,226 --> 00:12:58,160
[Thinking]
Sixteen hundred hours.

208
00:12:58,228 --> 00:13:00,560
The sun in its
crimson radiance...

209
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,360
bids a crepuscular adieu
to another day.

210
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:07,995
<i>Corporal Klinger was in his last</i>
<i>grisly hour of guard duty...</i>

211
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:12,201
<i>little knowing the fate that destiny</i>
<i>had planned up for him.</i>

212
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:14,709
<i>The Chinese were giving up</i>
<i>in hordes.</i>

213
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:17,906
<i>Sergeant Fierman brought in</i>
<i>three prisoners that he had captured...</i>

214
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:20,506
<i>after they had surrendered</i>
<i>voluntarily.</i>

215
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,915
<i>The sergeant bragadeered</i>
<i>to Corporal Klinger...</i>

216
00:13:22,986 --> 00:13:26,149
<i>that capturing prisoners</i>
<i>meant points towards discharge...</i>

217
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,349
<i>and early homeward bounding.</i>

218
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:32,691
<i>This information inspired</i>
<i>Klinger a whole lot.</i>

219
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:35,196
<i>The vainglorious corporal</i>
<i>ran like a bird...</i>

220
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:39,702
<i>and sped off in quest</i>
<i>of Chinese giver-uppers.</i>

221
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:42,533
But destiny
exterminated his luck.

222
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:47,838
<i>The Chinese G.I.s had not seen women</i>
<i>in an overexcited period of time.</i>

223
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:52,907
<i>Klinger barely escaped</i>
<i>with his purity still clean...</i>

224
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:56,577
<i>and in the process,</i>
<i>ruining his finest frockery.</i>

225
00:13:59,556 --> 00:14:02,423
<i>The corporal re-arrived</i>
<i>with his dignity dented...</i>

226
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:06,724
<i>and his nonchalantness</i>
<i>not so nifty.</i>

227
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:09,663
<i>Enough, boy! Enough!</i>

228
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:12,167
This whole unit is gonna get
a Section Eight.

229
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:14,465
I'm sorry. It's just
that I need the practice.

230
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:17,597
Radar, duty logs
have got to be military.

231
00:14:17,674 --> 00:14:20,643
If headquarters sees this,
they'll rip off my epaulets.

232
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,201
- Won't happen again, sir.
- Thank goodness.

233
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,375
But, Colonel, what is your actual
civilian opinion of my writing?

234
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:33,087
Son, Ethel Hemingway
may say I'm wrong...

235
00:14:33,156 --> 00:14:35,090
but I don't think
too much of it.

236
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:37,786
- Why, sir?
- 'Cause none of that's you.

237
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:39,886
It sounds like you swallowed
a dictionary.

238
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,329
But I'm just doing
what the book says.

239
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,833
Throw the book away!
I'm no authority...

240
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:47,802
but it seems to me the first rule
if you wanna be a writer...

241
00:14:47,871 --> 00:14:50,271
is be yourself.

242
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,610
Be yourself.

243
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,415
Must come later.

244
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:05,716
- What are you doing out here?
- Waiting for a ride home.

245
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:08,053
You ought to see Frank.
He's a new man.

246
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:10,684
Good. I didn't
like the old one.

247
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,389
It's good to hear him laughing
in the morgue again.

248
00:15:14,464 --> 00:15:16,591
Which one of us you think
is gonna get the Oscar?

249
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,533
Me, I hope. You know
how much I hate to lose.

250
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:23,265
- Right.
- Did you really say that to Frank?

251
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,172
Yeah. I was just looking for
something to knock you with.

252
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:29,541
It really bugs you when
I call you on foot faults, doesn't it?

253
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:33,139
- Are you kidding?
- Why else would you say I hate to lose?

254
00:15:33,216 --> 00:15:35,343
I don't know.
It just popped into my head.

255
00:15:35,418 --> 00:15:39,479
You really do think I'm too competitive,
that I always have to get the last word in?

256
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:42,423
- Well, yeah.
- You don't know me very well, do you?

257
00:15:42,492 --> 00:15:45,017
- Maybe I know you better than you think I do.
- You think so?

258
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:47,255
- I always have to get the last word in?
- That's right.

259
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,264
- I can prove to you...
- Come on!

260
00:15:49,332 --> 00:15:52,301
Just say something
and walk away.

261
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,802
All right.

262
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,862
- I think you're a very competitive person.
- Fine.

263
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,464
- You just did it.
- Did what?

264
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,031
Just got in the last word.

265
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:02,043
- That doesn't count.
- Then don't say anything.

266
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:03,806
- Okay.
- You're impossible.

267
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,440
- I'm impossible?
- Yes. Shut up, close your mouth.

268
00:16:06,516 --> 00:16:09,076
- Don't say another word.
- Okay.

269
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:12,144
Not another word!

270
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:15,157
- No problem.
- It's no use!

271
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,887
Wrong.

272
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:21,454
<i>Oh. Major Houlihan, ma'am.</i>

273
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:23,897
- Can I ask you a question?
- You just did.

274
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:27,562
No. It's for my writing course. Ma'am, I
have to write about a romantic interlude...

275
00:16:27,637 --> 00:16:29,571
and I don't think
I ever had one.

276
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,097
- What makes you think I have?
- Well, everyone knows that you're engaged.

277
00:16:33,176 --> 00:16:37,078
Yes, of course. And Lieutenant Colonel
Donald Penobscott...

278
00:16:37,146 --> 00:16:39,671
is <i>the</i> most romantic man
I've ever met.

279
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:43,651
Right. Well, may I ask then,
have you and him ever interluded?

280
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,847
- Many times.
- Oh.

281
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:50,621
I remember once, we were sipping wine
in a restaurant in Tokyo...

282
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:55,130
and a man came by our table...
a big man, must have weighed 250 pounds.

283
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,497
And he brushed my leg.
Naturally, I was alarmed and I screamed.

284
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:01,628
And Donald, without any thought
to his personal safety...

285
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:04,138
got up and he was ready
to punch that man in the mouth.

286
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:06,471
Oh, that's terrific.
What happened?

287
00:17:06,543 --> 00:17:08,977
- He got bit in the leg.
- The guy bit him?

288
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:12,344
No, no, the man's
Seeing Eye dog.

289
00:17:23,526 --> 00:17:25,585
What the devil's
he up to now?

290
00:17:25,662 --> 00:17:29,189
I wouldn't stick around
unless I had a strong stomach.

291
00:17:33,436 --> 00:17:36,200
Oh, my. He's gonna
immolate himself.

292
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:38,900
- Oh!
- Hold on, son. Don't do that.

293
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,637
Too late, Colonel.
I'm finally gonna get my discharge.

294
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:43,906
I'm going home
in a butt can.

295
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,417
Just think about what you're doing, boy.
Here, toss me those matches.

296
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,816
So long, war.

297
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:53,981
Good-bye, K.P.
Adios, Korea.

298
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:56,287
Sprinkle my ashes
over Toledo.

299
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:58,919
Klinger, put down
those matches.

300
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,122
- We can work this out.
- What he said.

301
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:04,860
- What's the use, Colonel?
- Well, give me a chance!

302
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:07,129
- Come on over to my office.
- Over to the office.

303
00:18:07,203 --> 00:18:09,671
Well, okay.

304
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:12,970
Save my spot.

305
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:15,442
Good choice, son.

306
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:21,112
- Hurry it up, Colonel. I'm a busy man.
- Relax, Klinger.

307
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:24,119
Where's the fire?
Sorry.

308
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:30,423
I'll take anything you got...
honorable, general, medical, whatever.

309
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:32,654
I appreciate how much
you hate this place...

310
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:35,220
but you've gotta understand,
it's not in my power.

311
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:40,201
I understand only one thing... you're
gonna give me a discharge or poof!

312
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:43,932
Klinger, I wanna help,
but I can't send you home.

313
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:48,137
Did you ever see a Lebanese
go up in flames? It's not pretty.

314
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:51,203
Would you settle for
some time back in Seoul?

315
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,306
Uh-uh. Freedom or fire.

316
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,511
Anything but a free ride.

317
00:18:56,586 --> 00:19:00,454
You're a tough cookie, Sherm,
but you're not as tough as me.

318
00:19:00,523 --> 00:19:02,650
I hope you can live
with yourself.

319
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:06,252
- Klinger, please.
- Remember me at your next weenie roast.

320
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:11,195
Klinger, what am I
gonna tell your wife?

321
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:13,997
Tell her I'd like to be kept
in a blue jar. That's my best color.

322
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,971
Son, you'll regret this
for the rest of your life.

323
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,237
I... shall not return.

324
00:19:21,978 --> 00:19:23,912
Shall I pour?

325
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:38,016
Who put gasoline
in my gasoline?

326
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,892
Stay away from me
with that cigar!

327
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:46,500
Everybody, back!
Don't anybody light a match!

328
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,740
<i>[Woman Screaming]</i>

329
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:56,006
## [Humming]

330
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,048
- Having a good time, Frank?
- Well, I'm the birthday boy.

331
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,208
Evening, Captains,
Major.

332
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:04,583
- What are you doing in here?
- Come to find somebody smart
to help me with my studies.

333
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:07,646
- Don't look at me.
- How's the writing going, Radar?

334
00:20:07,724 --> 00:20:11,524
Col. Potter says that I should just be
myself, but I don't know how to do that.

335
00:20:11,594 --> 00:20:15,496
It's simple.
Stop using fancy words.

336
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:18,557
Stop trying to find amusing anecdotes
and write about something
you wanna write about.

337
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:23,090
- Like what?
- Like Iowa or your animals or your Uncle Ed.

338
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,453
- <i>Something you feel strongly about.</i>
- Strongly?

339
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:28,188
Like if I were gonna write,
I'd probably write about...

340
00:20:28,262 --> 00:20:30,253
how easily friends
can turn on you.

341
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,560
Friends will kill
you every time.

342
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:36,797
- I don't think I understand.
- People forget about loyalty.

343
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:41,102
They forget you shouldn't make
up vicious rumors about somebody
while his back is turned.

344
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:44,667
I'd write about being
too suspicious and resentful.

345
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:47,009
- How about maligning a person's character?
- What?

346
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:49,845
- Overreacting, always trying
to get in the last word.
- Right.

347
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:51,612
- See?
- No.

348
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:54,483
- This is all good stuff, guys.
- Hey, wait a second.

349
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:56,682
I think I found something
that I feel strongly about.

350
00:20:56,757 --> 00:21:01,251
- How do you feel about shutting up?
- You know, my chest feels tight.

351
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:05,890
- What's the matter?
- It's you two guys fighting.
It makes me sick.

352
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:09,868
Don't you know that I come in here to
the Swamp to feel good, have a little laugh?

353
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:12,201
It's because you two guys
get along so good.

354
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:15,139
- Those days are over now. Get out of here.
- Go on, Radar.

355
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:19,578
Well, it's just you two guys
are terrific the way you work
together and laugh together...

356
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:21,511
and stick together.

357
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:24,779
I know you're always fooling around,
but you're always there
when the other guy needs ya.

358
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:28,049
- Now you're getting mushy.
- No, I'm not.

359
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:31,819
A lot of guys in the army say they're
friends, but these guys really are.

360
00:21:31,892 --> 00:21:33,860
Except for now.

361
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:37,522
Yeah, well...

362
00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:41,125
we're not really that mad
at each other, Radar.

363
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:43,931
- Are we?
- Nah.

364
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:47,906
- We're just play acting.
- We just wanted to give
Frank a birthday present.

365
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:51,308
- We wanted to make him happy.
- We were fighting to entertain you, Frank.

366
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:53,676
And it was wonderful!
I loved it!

367
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:56,238
Party's over, Frank.
Happy birthday.

368
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:01,083
It's your fault, you little creep!
You little buttinsky!

369
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:03,419
They were doing just fine
till you stuck your nose in here!

370
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,584
- I was trying to improve myself.
- Improving yourself is a waste of time.

371
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,426
- Frank should know. He gave up long ago.
- Geez, it was going so well too.

372
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:13,864
A perfectly good birthday
shot to hell!

373
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:15,731
Boy!

374
00:22:15,803 --> 00:22:18,704
Here.

375
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:21,297
- I'll buy you a drink.
- Thanks.

376
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,673
- Here's to you, Radar.
- One of a kind.

377
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,541
So are you two.

378
00:22:25,612 --> 00:22:28,342
You still love me
for all my faults?

379
00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:32,545
- What faults? You're perfect.
- Just for that, I'm gonna
let you get the last word in.

380
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:35,144
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

381
00:22:37,224 --> 00:22:39,818
[Thinking] Dear Mom,
I gave up on the writing course...

382
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:42,691
on account of I found out
I can write better as myself...

383
00:22:42,763 --> 00:22:46,096
than Hemingway, O'Neill
or any of those other bums.

384
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,225
And it doesn't
cost me anything.

385
00:22:48,302 --> 00:22:51,794
Give my love to everybody,
especially my nephews.

386
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:56,040
Simplistically yours...

387
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:58,577
Walter.

388
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,643
And now, from Ottumwa, Iowa,
deep in the mysterious Midwest...

389
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,449
<i>the world's first</i>
<i>magician/clerk/typist...</i>

390
00:23:08,522 --> 00:23:11,320
the amazing Radaro.

391
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:17,888
The hand is quicker
than the eye.

392
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:21,332
[Clears Throat, Whistling]

393
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,892
- [Hawkeye] Oh, a rabbit.
- No. Flowers.

394
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:27,634
- You could have fooled me.
- There's a trick to that.

395
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:31,667
Now, would a gentleman or a lady in
the audience please lend me their watch?

396
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,680
- Use Frank's.
- All right.

397
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:37,979
Sir, would you please place
your watch in this cloth?

398
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,383
We have the cloth...
and a hammer.

399
00:23:43,457 --> 00:23:46,620
- And now...
- He will destroy the watch.

400
00:23:46,693 --> 00:23:48,684
I've seen this.
There's nothing to it.

401
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:50,923
He slipped the watch
into his pocket when we weren't looking.

402
00:23:57,838 --> 00:24:02,138
- <i>[Rattling]</i>
- Sir, I think we made a little mistake.

403
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:11,674
You little creep!
You wrecked it!

404
00:24:11,752 --> 00:24:14,414
I got this from one
of my whiplash patients.

405
00:24:14,488 --> 00:24:17,150
Smashing trick, Radar.

406
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:20,057
This watch was worth
14 bucks!

407
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,061
I'm just a beginner.

408
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:24,996
Time for your next trick, Radar...
vanish into thin air.

409
00:24:25,065 --> 00:24:27,192
- Right.
- Corporal!

410
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:29,258
It was just a rehearsal!
