1
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,190
Your Majesty.

2
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,790
Tell me your plan, Major Ducos.

3
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,630
For the price of one death
and one imprisonment,

4
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,390
Britain will leave Spain
with no more shots being fired.

5
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,110
The deposed Spanish king Ferdinand

6
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,630
will sign a treaty which ends the war
between France and Spain.

7
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,350
We will withdraw
and Ferdinand will once again rule Spain

8
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,510
In return, King Ferdinand will promise
to end the alliance with Britain,

9
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,550
and the British army
will be ordered to leave Spain

10
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,270
Joseph likes being King of Spain.

11
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,110
I am sure Your Majesty's brother

12
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,550
would make a wise king wherever he is.

13
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,670
The Spanish people will continue to fight.

14
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,710
Only their beloved King Ferdinand
could make them accept the treaty.

15
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,070
But he wants reassurance.

16
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,190
Will the nobility of Spain support him?

17
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,550
Will the Spanish generals?

18
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,630
And most important of all,
what will the Church say?

19
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,550
And what will the Church say?

20
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,030
It will approve, Your Majesty.

21
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,700
It's very clever, Major Ducos.

22
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,750
Worthy of admiration

23
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,310
- should have thought of it.
- But you did

24
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,590
I'm merely taking the idea a little further.

25
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,590
But, Ducos,

26
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,470
what do you get?

27
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,510
Revenge.

28
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,470
On whom?

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,950
A British officer.

30
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,500
Major Richard Sharpe.

31
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,150
He has luck, this Sharpe?

32
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,670
At Talavera, Your Majesty,

33
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,430
he captured an imperial eagle
touched by your own hand.

34
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,710
See that his luck runs out.

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,670
We've got them running, Nairn.

36
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,670
We're going to chase them out of Spain
into France, and drown them in the Channel.

37
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,540
Pity of it is, we can't stop the scum looting
and destroying everything as they go.

38
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,070
Napoleon's got his troubles in Russia, sir.

39
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,950
They need all the money they can get.

40
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,190
- How are the men's spirits?
- They're dying for the fray, sir.

41
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,670
And Sharpe?

42
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,110
He is not the same man, sir.

43
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,230
The loss of his wife...

44
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,230
Grief... well...

45
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,270
takes men in different ways, sir.

46
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,710
I've got one for you.

47
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,830
Where does Napoleon keep his armies?

48
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,270
I don't know, Perkins.
Where does Napoleon keep his armies?

49
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,310
Up his sleevies! (Laughs)

50
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,590
- Drunk again, Harper.
- Oh, me too, sir.

51
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,630
(Laughter)

52
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,900
Blimey. He looks as grim as an Old Bailey judge.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,150
HARRIS: He's still blaming himself

54
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,150
COOPER: Gut and grief

55
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,990
SERGEANT MAJOR: Company dismissed!

56
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,910
If there's anything I can do for you, sir,

57
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,910
you know you only have to ask.

58
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,950
I know that, Pat.

59
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,230
How's Ramona?

60
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,270
Oh, she's grand, thanks, sir.

61
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,590
Mr. Nairn got us permission to get married.

62
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,590
That's good.

63
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,140
Aye. Well, you know...

64
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,190
I like her an awful lot, sir, and...

65
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,470
...what with the wee one on the way,
I suppose Mr. Nairn thought it would be best.

66
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,750
- So, when's the wedding?
- As soon as I can find a priest.

67
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,260
She's got herself a wedding dress, so she has.

68
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,270
It's got frills.

69
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,350
Ah, you know what women are like, sir.

70
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,150
Aye. I've known one or two, Pat.

71
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,270
Mm.

72
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,310
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

73
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,550
They like marrying, so they do.

74
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,590
- Especially when they're pregnant.
- (Chuckles)

75
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,830
Go to her, Pat.

76
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,870
- She needs you.
- (Ramona singing)

77
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:23,670
And never will play the wild rover no more

78
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,030
Wild rover, wild rover

79
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,150
Wild rover no more

80
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,590
And I never will play

81
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,310
The wild rover no more

82
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,030
- Eat, Patrick.
- Well, how's he doing?

83
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,150
Young Patrick, how's he doing, then?

84
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,800
- He might be a girl, huh?
- Well, I can tell you,

85
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,310
as long as it's one or the other, I don't mind.

86
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,920
Cómo está usted, sargento?

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,950
Bien. Gracias.
Y usted?

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,230
- Encantada de conocerle.
- What does that mean?

89
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,750
I am pleased know you

90
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,270
am pleased know you,

91
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,310
Do you know, the old soup isn't too bad, either.

92
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,750
HARPER: The sooner we march
on the French now the better

93
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,230
He needs a good batter

94
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,030
He needs a good woman.

95
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,070
Well, he had one.

96
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,470
But he lost her.

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,950
He went and lost her, so he did.

98
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,030
Fasten! Fasten!

99
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,150
We have to go faster!
My husband will know by now that I've fled.

100
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,190
Please don't worry, Hélêne. My men
are guarding you. We will get you there.

101
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,190
We have to.

102
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,470
I built my whole life towards this, General.

103
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,510
Oh, call me Raoul, please.

104
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,060
I will get you to Paris. Trust me.

105
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,310
You are so beautiful

106
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,590
And you are so brave.

107
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,830
Oh, if only you would say yes to living with me
in Paris, you would make me so very happy.

108
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,030
But, Raoul, you already have a wife.

109
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,470
Ah, oui, but she's old and ugly.
And you make me feel...

110
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,750
- 60 again.
- (They laugh)

111
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,150
You have a wicked tongue.

112
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,950
But then again, so do I.

113
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,630
(Neighing)

114
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,990
I apologize for the interruption, General,

115
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,430
- but have orders from the Emperor
- For me?

116
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,510
For the Marquesa.

117
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,470
How do you do, Hélêne?

118
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,350
So, you're running away, Marquesa?

119
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,390
Like the rest of the French army.

120
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,790
They have fought for their country.

121
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,830
Unlike you.

122
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,910
Oh, Pierre, my life was in danger every day.

123
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,070
It still is.

124
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,550
Your convoy is loaded with gold and silver plate,

125
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,590
paintings, coins, statues,

126
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,630
tapestries, carvings,

127
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,150
and a wine cellar packed in sawdust.

128
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,430
The total value is um...
one million Spanish doubloons.

129
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,510
You've missed the furniture.

130
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,550
There's a mirrored bed.

131
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,590
Oh.

132
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,110
Is that the one in which you persuade
the General to guard your stolen property?

133
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,390
- (Laughs)
- He's a fool.

134
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,590
That makes two of you.

135
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,590
Don't mock me, Hélêne.

136
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,590
I can destroy you.

137
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,590
Despise your kind Marquesa

138
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,110
You're half-English, and yet you work for us.

139
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,430
I'm half-French.

140
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,030
You married a Spaniard,

141
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,070
and while your husband fights

142
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,310
- for his country you steal his property
- I fight for France!

143
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,910
You fight for yourself!

144
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,790
You have no shame.

145
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,790
No country.

146
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,790
You disgust me.

147
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,590
What a pity,

148
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,710
when I find you so attractive.

149
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,350
You've had it easy in this war, Hélêne.

150
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,350
Fluttering your eyelashes

151
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,390
and living in Spanish splendor

152
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,040
with your dear husband the Marqués.

153
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,550
I married him at Napoleon's request.

154
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,950
Do you think I enjoyed having him grunt all over
me while I stole information for people like you?

155
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,950
I never considered it.

156
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,990
But then you've never had sex.

157
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,070
What do you want, Pierre?

158
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,470
You will write a letter.

159
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,830
I don't take orders from you.

160
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,830
They don't come from me.
They come from the highest authority.

161
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,190
You will write a letter,
telling your husband the reason you have fled

162
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,710
is that an English officer, Major Richard Sharpe,

163
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,750
has forced his intentions on you,

164
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,790
and while drunk,

165
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,590
he tried to attack you.

166
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,630
I've never met this Sharpe.

167
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,070
Write the letter.

168
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,350
Your property is loaded
on French army wagons.

169
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,670
- Condemned ones.
- I can countermand the condemnation.

170
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,750
Write.

171
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,720
Buenas tardes, Señor Marqués.

172
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,430
Whatever we make the chief object
of our desires

173
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,950
will draw our minds and endeavors after it.

174
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,550
He who places his greatest happiness
in the world

175
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,670
will every day become

176
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,710
more worldly

177
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,310
For the world, he will plod and sweat.

178
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,830
He will

179
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,620
descend into what is low and unbecoming.

180
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,430
And will often be tempted

181
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,950
to what is not truly fair and just

182
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,270
Eternal life

183
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,900
can only be given by Jesus Christ

184
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,190
whose capacity to confer it

185
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,470
the Father hath sealed

186
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,510
and certified. Amen.

187
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,790
The blessing of God Almighty,

188
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,070
the Father, the Son

189
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,590
and the Hoy Ghost

190
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,110
be amongst you

191
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,230
and remain with you always

192
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,270
Amen.

193
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,950
SERGEANT MAJOR: Company

194
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,990
dismissed!

195
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,430
Are you Sharpe?

196
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,870
- Who are you?
- Are you Sharpe?

197
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,260
I'll tan your arse
if you don't learn some manners.

198
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,150
I am Major Mendora.

199
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,190
My name is Sharpe.

200
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,430
Easy.

201
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,350
- Easy, easy.
- That was from my master,

202
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,870
the Marqués de Casares el Grande.

203
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,910
My master's wife the Marquesa

204
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,310
has written to him
telling of your brutish behavior

205
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,350
Of your cowardly attack on her.

206
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,590
I've never met her.

207
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,270
You have caused grave offence!

208
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,310
So have you, mate.

209
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,590
There is a clearing in the woods,

210
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,470
at the south road. Seven this evening.

211
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,790
What was all that about?

212
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,830
God knows.

213
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,910
You gave your word that I could leave.

214
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,950
But I'm keeping it, Marquesa.

215
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,110
These are condemned wagons.

216
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,030
I couldn't let you meet with an accident
on the way.

217
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,470
So, Napoleon's made you his wagon master.

218
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,230
Congratulations, Pierre.

219
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,950
Listen, you want to have a good think about this.

220
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,270
If Wellington finds out, you're done for.

221
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,030
You know what he says.
Duels are forbidden. Huh?

222
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,110
How well did you get to know this Marquesa,
anyhow?

223
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,150
- Don't you start!
- No, sir.

224
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,190
I'll kill the Marqués.

225
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,790
And when I find his bloody Marquesa, I'll kill hen

226
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,910
- Of course you will, sir.
- What does he want?

227
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,230
Major Sharpe, sir.

228
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,270
Captain.

229
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,110
I trust you're not going ahead with this duel, sir.

230
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,660
The sight of Spanish blood upset you, does it?

231
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,470
I've been speaking
with some of the Spanish officers.

232
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,590
The Marqués is a very fine swordsman.

233
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,470
He's been taking lessons in Paris from Bouillet.

234
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,830
Well, he can take lessons in Spain from me.

235
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,550
- No further.
- You must have a second.

236
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,550
I'll bear responsibility alone for this
before Wellington.

237
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,670
He'll try and get

238
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,830
the sun in your eyes.
He'll feint right and thrust left.

239
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,790
Make your feint your attack, sir.

240
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,790
Just knock the shite out of him, sir.

241
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,440
Good luck.

242
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,670
You have one more chance, Major Sharpe.

243
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,710
Apologize and resign.

244
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,710
I have nothing to apologize for.

245
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,750
MENDORA: Very well

246
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,790
the duel ends in a death

247
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,870
MENDORA: Estáis listo, mi señor?

248
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,110
Major Sharpe?

249
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,340
Argh!

250
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,350
I wouldn't smile yet, if I were you.

251
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,190
You fat bastard.

252
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,230
They won't find a coffin to fit you

253
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,670
We've played by your rules.

254
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,390
Now we'll play by mine.

255
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,540
(Groans)

256
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,630
- I bet you never saw that in a duel.
- This is not a duel, it's a brawl!

257
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,630
(Gunshot)
- Major Sharpe!

258
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,830
What the hell do you think you're doing?

259
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,910
A matter of honor, sir.

260
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,140
Honor?!

261
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,870
The duel is not over.

262
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,520
Listen to me. There is no duel.

263
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,470
There was no duel.

264
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,910
This is a friendly sword practice.

265
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,270
Do you understand me?

266
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,470
Major Sharpe.

267
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,750
Dios...

268
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,390
(Snores)

269
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,270
Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata,

270
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,910
miserere nobilis

271
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,750
Agnus Dei

272
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,790
qui tollis peccata

273
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,030
- miserere nobilis
- (Groans)

274
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,350
You're under arrest Major Sharpe

275
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,700
What?!

276
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,750
Stand back.

277
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,790
Hand me your sword, Major Sharpe.

278
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,750
Major Sharpe, you are charged with the murder

279
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,910
of the Marqués de Casares el Grande.

280
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,390
I've been sleeping all night.

281
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,870
How did he die?

282
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,470
Throat slit

283
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,510
from ear to ear as he slept

284
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,830
SHARPE: I didn't kill him

285
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,550
I swear, sir, on my honor.

286
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,990
You're under arrest, Major Sharpe.

287
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,590
If I don't get you under lock and key

288
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,950
the Spanish will hang you.

289
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,030
Prisoner and escort, forward!

290
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,030
Forward... march!

291
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,990
RAOUL: Au revoir.

292
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,830
- I will see you in Paris.
- Goodbye, Raoul.

293
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,190
Come soon.

294
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,230
HORSEMAN: Hay-ya!

295
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,270
But you always do.

296
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,670
I appreciate the feelings of our Spanish allies,

297
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,300
but I have to tell you that Major Sharpe
is innocent until proved guilty.

298
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,910
We have no intention of handing him oven
to you There will be a court martial

299
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,560
Evidence will be heard, and then, and only then,

300
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,590
will judgment be passed.

301
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,350
Do I make myself clear?

302
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,870
(Clicks heels)

303
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,590
Did he do it, Nairn?

304
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,630
He swears he did not, sir.

305
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,030
And I believe him.

306
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,190
He fought a duel, defying my orders.
He lied about that.

307
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,230
He says he's never met the Marquesa.

308
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,270
Then why does the lady accuse him?

309
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,990
Apparently, she wrote a tearful letter to
her now-deceased husband, God rest his soul,

310
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,540
telling him of Sharpe's vile indiscretions.

311
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,940
That letter was delivered
by the good Father Hacha.

312
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,110
- The Inquisitor?
- The very one, sir.

313
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,350
He has the ear of the Cardinal
and the heart of a snake.

314
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,990
DUCOS: And how is Major Sharpe?

315
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,430
He's on trial for the murder of the Marqués.

316
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,270
The whole army is outraged.

317
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,350
What a beautiful day.

318
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,990
Now you pay us

319
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,430
The Marqués, as your brother will tell you,

320
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,430
had a clause in his will

321
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,470
that's not uncommon -

322
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,590
that if his widow takes her vows as a nun,

323
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,590
all his wealth reverts to the Church.

324
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,430
And you Father Hacha

325
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,270
as God's representative in this area

326
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,310
will take the inheritance.

327
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,030
The Marquesa left in a convoy
not two hours ago

328
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,910
The money is with her.

329
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,950
- We will kill her.
- No!

330
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,870
It must remain legal.

331
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,580
I need some letters, Father Hacha,

332
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,630
from the Spanish nobility

333
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,790
assuring your king Ferdinand

334
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,870
that a peace with France will be acceptable.

335
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,070
I am sure that will not be a difficulty.

336
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,230
Your troops

337
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,270
will leave us alone?

338
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,230
You have my word.

339
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,620
And you have mine.

340
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,950
If Sharpe is found not guilty, the Spanish
will never believe us or trust us again.

341
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,950
They want justice.

342
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,070
I think they should get it, sir.

343
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,870
Whatever the verdict.

344
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,470
Major Sharpe?

345
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,790
Lieutenant Trumper Jones, sir.
Your defending officer.

346
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,670
Been here long, have you?

347
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,270
Two months, sir. (Chuckles)

348
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,710
Have you done this before?

349
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,430
(Laughs nervously)

350
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,310
Could you tell us what the letter says,
Major Mendora?

351
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,350
In English, if you please.

352
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,750
My dear Pablo,

353
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,670
what I have to tell you pains my heart,

354
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,710
and will wound you deeply.

355
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,910
I have fled because of the unwelcome attentions
of Major Richard Sharpe.

356
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,990
He has pestered me at every opportunity
with shameful suggestions

357
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,870
and indecent invitations

358
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,990
I have to tell you that, further to this,

359
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,870
on the night of the 16th of April,

360
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,950
Major Sharpe appeared at our home

361
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,990
in a state of drunkenness

362
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,230
He forced his way into our house

363
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,190
and begged me to sleep with him...

364
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,660
- I've never met the woman!
- Major Sharpe.

365
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,670
I will have silence

366
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,350
in this court. Is that clear?

367
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,430
Go on please

368
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,630
Major Mendora.

369
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,110
He said that there was only one woman
in the world for him,

370
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,150
and that was me.

371
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,190
And if he had to kill you to have me,

372
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,230
then so be it.

373
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,270
Thank you, Major Mendora.

374
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,590
Could you tell the court please

375
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,510
what happened
after the Manqués received the letter?

376
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,830
Major Sharpe refused to apologize,
so there was a duel.

377
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,910
And this duel came to an abrupt end

378
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,950
did it not?

379
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,750
It was stopped, yes. But Major Sharpe

380
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,990
- was roaring at this time
- Roaring?

381
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,030
He was cursing

382
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,790
and vowing that he would kill the Marqués.

383
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,230
In a duel? Thank you, Major Mendora.

384
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,230
Mr. Trumper Jones.

385
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,830
Major...

386
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,870
(Clears throat)

387
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,910
Major Mendora,

388
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,070
you have a vested interest
in seeing Major Sharpe hang, have you not?

389
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,190
No.

390
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,550
You were gravely insulted by Major Sharpe
before this...

391
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,030
...sword practice.

392
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,550
Objection, sir. It was a duel.

393
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,790
A duel forbidden by Lord Wellington.

394
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,310
Mr. Trumper Jones,
you will refer to the duel as the duel.

395
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,350
Is that clear?

396
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,390
Yes, sir. (Clears throat)

397
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,190
Major Mendora,

398
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,550
did Major Sharpe not insult your manhood
when he threatened to tan your arse?

399
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,030
I did not hear that.

400
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,070
- You're a liar!
- Major Sharpe!

401
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,070
Major Sharpe!

402
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:05,230
Gentleman you may not be, but you will
behave like one in this court. Is that clear?

403
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,070
Sir.

404
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,030
- Please, sir.
- Where's Nairn? Where the hell is he?

405
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,750
I don't know.

406
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,070
We've heard from the Spanish guard
at the Marqués' quarters

407
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,150
that he saw a British rifle officer
with a straight sword

408
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,020
leave there at three o'clock this morning
Can you explain that?

409
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,830
I slept right through till dawn, sir.

410
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,390
- But you have no witnesses to swear to that?
- I did not kill him.

411
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,470
So you keep telling us, Major Sharpe.

412
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,630
You also keep telling us
that you have never met the Marquesa,

413
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,150
yet here we have a letter
from her to her husband,

414
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,860
a nobleman of Spain
detailing vile and repellent

415
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,910
advances by you on her.

416
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,950
Perhaps you could tell us

417
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,190
- why she would say this.
- I don't know!

418
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,590
She's lying!

419
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,910
(Sighs)

420
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,510
(Neighing)

421
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,070
Venga. Por aquí.

422
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,310
(Screams)

423
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,350
(Laughs)

424
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,590
MARQUESA: No! No!

425
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,750
Vamos Allí está

426
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,870
Your husband is dead, Marquesa.

427
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,750
I'd find it hard to tell the difference.

428
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,870
You are an adulteress and a murderer.

429
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,150
And I have come to save you from your sins.

430
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,790
You've come to help yourself, priest!

431
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,070
- (Chuckles)
- No!

432
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,110
No!

433
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,350
(Groans)

434
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,910
In the Convent of the Heavens

435
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,430
you will find peace.

436
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,470
Hay-ya!

437
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,390
We find you guilty of murder, Sharpe.

438
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,310
You have brought dishonor upon your regiment
and the British army

439
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,430
You are hereby stripped of your rank

440
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,750
You will be escorted from here

441
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,790
to a place of execution,

442
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,390
and in the presence of our allies,
you will be hanged by the neck

443
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,430
until dead

444
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,470
Have you anything to say?

445
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,590
Permission to die in my rifleman's jacket, sir?

446
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,070
Denied.

447
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,150
(Hammering)

448
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,390
(Hammering continues)

449
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,350
Perkins, Hagman,
kill anyone who tries to stop us.

450
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,790
BOTH: Sarge.
- Let's go.

451
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,790
You will stay exactly where you are!

452
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,950
Says who? Sir.

453
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,990
Wellington.

454
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,030
(Footsteps)

455
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,860
(Slow drumming)

456
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,270
(Drumming continues)

457
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,310
Should I serve sherry to the Spanish officers,
sir?

458
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,940
Damn it, Stokely, it's an execution,
not a bloody christening!

459
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,470
Sir.

460
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,310
- España!
- (Crowd cheers)

461
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,230
- A la horca!
- Lo tiene merecido!

462
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,750
(Crowd shouting)

463
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,990
(Drumming continues)

464
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,150
(Drumming stops)

465
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,270
(Cheering)

466
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,180
Now that is over, gentlemen,
perhaps we can get on with this war.

467
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,390
It's a damn waste, Harper.

468
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,110
It was damn murder, sir.

469
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,630
(Whispers) Sergeant!

470
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,190
(Whispers) Patrick. Patrick!

471
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,350
Shh!

472
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,470
- Sergeant! Sergeant Harper!
- Sir.

473
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,350
Come with me. I have a job for you.
Put these on.

474
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,950
Say your farewells

475
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,910
And hurry up!

476
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,230
(Whispers) You mind yourself, now.

477
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,270
And him.

478
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,910
I love you an awful lot.

479
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,630
Could I ask you where we're going, sir?

480
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,870
Over the hills, Sergeant, and far away.

481
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,750
Which hills, and how far?

482
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,380
NAIRN: Questions questions
it's all questions and mostly no answers

483
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,750
Get your stinking robbing hands off me!

484
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,990
God will strike you down, you'll see,

485
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,110
with the plague. More likely the pox.

486
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,630
Thieves! Thieves! Bloody thieves!

487
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,670
Let me out of here!

488
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,500
(Sighs)

489
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,910
(Bird squawking)

490
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,550
(Bird squawking)

491
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,390
When this wars over

492
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,470
will you go back home, Sergeant?

493
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,310
If I'm alive, me, Ramona and the baby
will head home.

494
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,150
If I'm dead

495
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,190
and they bury me here,

496
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,470
my spirit'll soar straight back to Ireland.

497
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,150
So you believe in ghosts, do you, Sergeant?

498
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,190
I believe in God the Father,

499
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,190
God the Son,

500
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,660
and the shee riding the wind.

501
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,710
(Chuckles)

502
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,390
(Horse neighs)

503
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,430
(Cocks rifle)

504
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,470
Here's a ghost for you, Sergeant Harper.

505
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,670
His name was Liam Dooley.

506
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,750
He and his brother were going to be hanged
for looting a church.

507
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,430
I made them an offer.

508
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,470
One could live but one would die

509
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,230
Liam called "heads"

510
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,550
It was a very bad call.

511
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,230
Who knows I'm alive?

512
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,230
Us, Wellington, the provosts who hung Dooley,

513
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,990
and they're sworn to secrecy

514
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,910
Why all the shenanigans, sir?

515
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,510
The French are running away. The bastards
haven't got the stomach for any more.

516
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,380
They're using every dirty trick they can
to drive a wedge between us and the Spanish.

517
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,430
That's why we must find out what they're up to
and stop them.

518
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,110
Who's "we"?

519
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,830
You and Sergeant Harper, of course.

520
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,510
You will go into enemy territory
find the Marquesa and bring her to me

521
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,390
- I'll bloody kill her!
- You will not, and that's an order.

522
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,390
She knows the answer to the er

523
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,310
shenanigans.

524
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,860
So why did she write the letter?

525
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,830
She's a French spy. Her mother was English,
her father was a Frenchy.

526
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,830
She married the Marqués probably on the orders

527
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,270
- of Napoleon himself
- I'm a soldier.

528
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,230
I'm for fighting, not spying.

529
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,590
You'll do as you're told, Sharpe.

530
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,470
Oh, yes. You'll need this.

531
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,630
Now, listen to me.

532
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,070
There's a priest not 20 miles from here.
Father Sanchez. He's a good man.

533
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,230
Hears things on the wind. Speak to him.

534
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,270
Well, that's a start.

535
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,350
Go carefully. Remember you're dead.

536
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,550
What if we don't find the Marquesa?

537
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,590
Don't come back.

538
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,590
Good luck.

539
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,550
Gracias.

540
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,000
Permission to leave the column and speak, sir?

541
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,030
Carry on.

542
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,510
Where's Sergeant Harper, sir?

543
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,590
Sergeant Harper is doing a job for me.

544
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,000
Look after his woman until he returns, Hagman.

545
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,030
We will, sir.

546
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,070
We stick together, you see.

547
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,030
Ramona is part of us.
Just like Major Sharpe was.

548
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,710
Permission to rejoin

549
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,630
the column, sir?

550
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,950
Carry on.

551
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,510
Para, por favor!

552
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,310
Shite!

553
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,430
- Are you all right?
- I've been happier.

554
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,150
(Gunshots)

555
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,190
- Is he alive?
- Just.

556
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,630
Bastards.

557
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,670
It's four against two.

558
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,110
- Good odds.
- There'll be more in a minute.

559
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,750
You stay here.

560
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,990
(Whistles)

561
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,710
(Yells)

562
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,910
(Yells)

563
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,910
(Groans)

564
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,150
Maquesa e Casaes

565
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,950
We must find the Marquesa. You understand?

566
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,150
Marquesa... Dorada?

567
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,510
(Whispers) Golden-haired. She's golden-haired.

568
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,790
Where is she?

569
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,470
The Manquesa?

570
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,470
El Matarife.

571
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,830
Hermano Hacha. Hermano.

572
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,870
Where is she?

573
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,830
Maquesa Dorada?

574
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,540
Partisanos... el convento.

575
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,190
Partisans?

576
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,030
Dónde? Dónde?

577
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,870
Santa

578
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,630
Monica

579
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,550
Come on.

580
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,590
(Gunshots)

581
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,110
(Bell rings)

582
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,990
Thank you, Father.

583
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,150
- Support is growing.
- Every hour.

584
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,510
The Spanish nobles are desperate to help.

585
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,470
When King Ferdinand returns,

586
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,550
perhaps the Inquisition will return, too.

587
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,310
I pray for it.

588
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,950
HARPER: That's the convent up there

589
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,470
SHARPE: Aye

590
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,190
SHARPE: The partisans will see us
soon enough.

591
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,630
HARPER: Think they have already

592
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,100
Vamos. Defiéndete, cobarde!

593
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,350
(Cheering)

594
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,240
(Cheering)

595
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,070
Yah!

596
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,230
(Cheering continues)

597
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,830
(Rifles cocked)

598
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,030
I am a British officer. Major Vaughan.

599
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,990
Bringing the compliments
of my general Wellington

600
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,390
He has heard of me?

601
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,060
Who has not heard of El Matarife?

602
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,470
Great guess, sir.

603
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,350
You hate the French, Major Vaughan?

604
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,820
I fight them every day.

605
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,110
You should see how I fight them. Huh?

606
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,670
(Cheering)

607
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,060
I don't think I want to see this.

608
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,030
(Shouts of encouragement)

609
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,470
Bastards.

610
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,510
(Shouts of encouragement)

611
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,030
(Cocks rifle)

612
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,350
(Gunshot)

613
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,670
(Rifles cocked)

614
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,070
Now I can boast I fought against the French...

615
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,150
...alongside the great Matarife.

616
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,990
You hear him?

617
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,670
He says

618
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,710
he has fought beside me.

619
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,070
Wellington needs your help.

620
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,390
(Rifles disarmed)

621
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,390
The British army is advancing
and pushing the French back on the Great Road.

622
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,670
I have come here because the General wants
an assurance that every partisan will be on hand

623
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,950
to harass the retreating French and kill them.

624
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,990
Every partisan

625
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,590
- But especially El Matarife
- (Grunts)

626
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,990
You can tell the general

627
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,830
my forces will help him.

628
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,510
There is one other thing Wellington seeks.

629
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,190
You guard the Marquesa Dorada?

630
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,950
- Wellington asks this?
- We en

631
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,630
heard she'd been brought here.

632
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,630
- Where did you hear?
- Everything El Matarife does is important to us.

633
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,710
- Hmm.
- But we would like to talk to her

634
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,030
She knows things about the French army
that could be of help to us.

635
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,670
You wish to talk with her?

636
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,070
I do.

637
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,350
Maybe more than talk, eh?

638
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,180
She's in the convent up there?

639
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,270
No, she's here.

640
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,630
You can talk with her. Come.

641
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,270
Come.

642
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,390
You had orders to watch her!

643
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,110
Sorry, señor. This man will be punished.

644
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,790
Castígale!

645
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,950
Ah, good luck, my friends.

646
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,270
Whoever she was, she died for no reason.

647
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,110
Whoever?

648
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,150
The Marquesa has golden hair.

649
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,270
That poor dead girl's hair was black.

650
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,710
Marquesa Dorada.

651
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,750
Some poor serving girl.

652
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,790
Another soul who didn't need to die.

653
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,870
(Groaning)

654
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,910
I hope you are well.

655
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,270
I hope you are in excruciating pain.

656
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,630
Father Hacha has told me

657
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,030
- of your deep desire to repent
- I haven't sinned enough yet.

658
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,230
...and embrace the faith.

659
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:51,390
I'd love to join your happy band, Sister,
but you'd need to get a better dressmaker.

660
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,110
God hears your wicked tongue.

661
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,750
He sees your thieving,

662
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,470
you viperous virgin!

663
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,550
I fear you have a long road to travel

664
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,510
before you can place your heart
in the hands of the Creator.

665
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,270
But... we have time.

666
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,820
(Squeals)

667
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,990
(Bells chime in distance)

668
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,710
Take the horses and wait down there, Pat.

669
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,950
HARPER: Good luck.

670
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,790
Matarife! Matarife! El inglés!

671
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,310
Que ha subido allí arriba al convento.

672
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,470
I have come to see
la Maquesa de Casares el Grande

673
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,510
She is not here.

674
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,430
I have traveled far to see her.

675
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,470
Who are you?

676
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,750
- Major Vaughan.
- It is against God's law to see her.

677
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:20,790
- I'm sure God will forgive me.
- You cannot see her.

678
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,830
Go away!

679
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,960
Go away! Go away!

680
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,990
(Rings bell)
- Leave!

681
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,470
- Marquesa!
(Continuous bell-ringing)

682
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,790
Marquesa!

683
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,710
Oh, shite.

684
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,750
Marquesa!

685
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,380
- Manquesa!
- Detenede

686
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,230
Marquesa!

687
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,670
(Stifled shout)

688
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,190
(Nuns yell in Spanish)

689
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,110
Fuera!

690
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,030
(Yells)

691
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,030
Did Raoul send you?

692
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,070
Come on, sir.

693
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,350
- Stop!
- Too late, Sister!

694
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,390
I'm off to commit adultery!

695
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,430
Lots of it!

696
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,990
A little bit of a wee problem, sir.

697
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,430
HARPER: Nothing we can't handle though

698
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,950
(Yells)

699
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,430
(Neighing)

700
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,030
Come on!

701
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,950
- (Gees up horses)
- (Neighing)

702
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,630
HARPER: Are you all right?
SHARPE: Aye.

703
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,670
HARPER: I think we should stop.
SHARPE: Later. Go on.

704
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,510
(Marquesa screams)

705
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,150
Lose the horses!

706
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,510
Bloody horses! I never want to see
a bloody horse again! Bloody...

707
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,350
- Shut up!
- You won't make it on foot.

708
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,270
We won't make it on horseback, either.
Lose the horses, they'll follow the trail.

709
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,790
MARQUESA: My bloody hair

710
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,550
Shut up!

711
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,590
Go on!

712
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,830
- Go on! Go on!
(Neighing)

713
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,510
MARQUESA: Oh, God!

714
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,990
Where are we going?

715
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,110
- I said, where are we going?
- Shut up!

716
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,190
Lean on me.

717
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,710
Sit on your arse... before I tan it.

718
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,550
Like you tanned the nuns' arses?

719
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,110
You didn't, did you?

720
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,150
He wouldn't hit them.

721
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,670
- They're good people.
- Dear God! They're thieves and liars!

722
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,750
You were in good company, then.
Bet you were sorry to leave.

723
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:54,030
- Is the bullet still in it?
- No, it sliced me.

724
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,510
You saved my life.

725
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,790
You tried to end mine.

726
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,670
I've never met you.

727
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,710
Oh, did you hear that, Pat?

728
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,950
- She's never met me.
- It's still bleeding, sir.

729
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,420
HARPER: Don't move
SHARPE: What about

730
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,990
my shameful suggestions?

731
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:15,860
- Your what?
- Oh she's denying me now Pat

732
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,750
- After all we've been through. Ow!
- I hear her, sir.

733
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:25,270
You'd think she'd remember the man
who got down on his knees - drunk, mind -

734
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:29,590
and crawled on her floor, begging Her Ladyship
to sleep with him. Bugger!

735
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,350
- I'd remember him.
- Aye,

736
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,390
so would I

737
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,350
The man lost his honor
because of the lady's lies.

738
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,870
Stripped of his rank, hung on a rope.

739
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:44,790
Who are you?

740
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,390
You know who am

741
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,510
My name is Sharpe.

742
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,500
The stink of that hole is all over me.

743
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,270
Good.

744
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,230
I want this off. It's got fleas.

745
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,230
Poor buggers have got you

746
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,310
please, I ask you.

747
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,070
Go on.

748
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,470
You'll have to help me.

749
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,750
Go on, then.

750
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,030
God save Ireland.

751
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,910
Oh, it's very cold weather for the time of the year.

752
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,710
The nights are drawing in.

753
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,150
Give me that.

754
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,110
Thank you.

755
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,310
SHARPE: You steal this?
- It's mine.

756
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,510
And I've got more money than you've ever dreamed of

757
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,390
In the wagons they took from me.
Matarife and his brother.

758
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,590
Who's his brother?

759
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,270
Hacha, the Inquisitor.

760
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,310
Hermano.

761
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,960
Do you remember the old priest tried to tell us?

762
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,220
You stole it.

763
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:56,310
For God's sake! It's mine.
Ducos tried to take it from me.

764
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,990
SHARPE: Major Ducos?
- You know him?

765
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,790
We have met.

766
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,260
He made me write the letter.

767
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,820
- Where is he?
- Santa Mana

768
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,390
Give me a hand up.

769
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,070
That wasn't a very polite move, now, ma'am.

770
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,510
Hup!

771
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,830
- Do you want the partisans to have you?
- Don't be stupid!

772
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,830
Bloody French on one side,
a madman on the other,

773
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,590
and we're stuck here
with a woman who had me hung.

774
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,590
God does work in mysterious ways.

775
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,750
Cabrones

776
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,790
(Neighing)

777
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,670
He needs help.

778
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,070
Do you have a woman, Sharpe?

779
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,990
I did.

780
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,640
Did you leave her behind?

781
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,580
She died.

782
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,630
I'm sorry.

783
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,190
(Groaning)

784
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,070
- Argh!
- Ramona

785
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,190
- I'll get one of the women.
- Nay. There's no time.

786
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,230
(Groaning continues)

787
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,270
You shouldn't hate me.

788
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,710
You're a spy.

789
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,030
I'm a soldier Sharpe

790
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,070
I can't carry a rifle, so I use what I've got.

791
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,270
Besides,

792
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,430
what's a poor got to do to get on in the world?

793
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,510
You're not poor.

794
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,110
What do you dream of, Sharpe?

795
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,710
Going home.

796
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,430
Me an' all.

797
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,310
(Gasps)

798
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,470
- She has to be on her back.
- (Groans)

799
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,510
Déjame! Estúpido!

800
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,510
But she doesn't want to be.

801
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,950
- She must be lying on her back.
- Who says?

802
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,070
- A bloody doctor, that's who!
- Help me!

803
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,950
No se que hago.

804
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,990
(Groans)

805
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,910
(Chuckles) See? Francis.

806
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,430
(Whimpering)

807
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,030
- Francis?
- Huh?

808
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,470
Blankets.

809
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,510
Blankets?

810
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,590
Oh, yes, then. Blankets. Blankets.

811
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,830
- (Groans)
- Have you done this before?

812
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,540
Not with human childs,

813
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,590
no.

814
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,230
(Cocks rifle)

815
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,310
I think I'll take a wee look.

816
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,270
I have been poor, Sharpe

817
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,590
I'm crying.

818
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,910
And I've dreamt all my life
of a house on the Seine.

819
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,950
Good wine and handsome men.

820
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,830
I haven't always been a lady.

821
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,670
Oh. You surprise me.

822
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,030
(Chuckles)

823
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,790
Who killed the Marqués?

824
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,990
The priest or his brother.

825
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,510
But Ducos... Ducos is the one. Ducos has no...

826
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,550
Honor.

827
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:35,590
You're a strange man, Sharpe.

828
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,430
You speak of honor.

829
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,630
You wouldn't hit the nuns.

830
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,030
You can't be bought.

831
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,230
You don't like me.

832
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,270
I've never met a man like you.

833
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,070
(Shivers)

834
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,110
You're cold.

835
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,990
I'm scared.

836
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,230
So am I.

837
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,270
I don't believe you.

838
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,310
Good.

839
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,670
I didn't say I didn't like you.

840
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,830
(Groaning)

841
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,870
What the devil's going on here?

842
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,870
We're delivering a baby, sir.

843
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,910
What?!

844
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,150
- (Groaning)
- Go on you're nearly there

845
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,190
Right. Carry on.

846
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,270
Go on we're with you! Go on!

847
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:18,310
- Go on!
- (Groans)

848
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,590
You've done it! You've done it!

849
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,630
(Ramona sighs)

850
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,710
It's a little boy.

851
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,180
Come and have a look. Look here. Look.

852
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,230
Look! Eh?

853
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,950
Look

854
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,070
(Gurgles)

855
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,190
Give thanks unto the Lord

856
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,830
for he is good.

857
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:54,190
ALL: Because his mercy endureth for ever.

858
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,230
Bless this child

859
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,270
for he is a gift upon the earth

860
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:01,310
Wash away his tears

861
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,350
Sweeten his sorrow.

862
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,390
Amen.

863
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,430
OTHERS: Amen.

864
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,750
(Gurgling)

865
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,790
(Cries)

866
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:38,750
(Cocks rifle)
- Oh. I have to attend a call of nature.

867
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,990
- I'll escort you.
- Is that strictly necessary?

868
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,030
I'm afraid it is, ma'am.

869
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,350
Bloody freezing!

870
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,390
Must be the weather, ma'am.

871
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,510
Lêve-toi, bon sang!

872
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,110
Raoul.

873
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,470
Go, Sergeant Harper.

874
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,510
You can't help Sharpe.

875
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,230
Take your chance.

876
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,270
Go.

877
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,270
Raoul!

878
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,190
Raoul!

879
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:55,230
Raoul.

880
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,070
The partisans took the wagons
and locked me in the convent.

881
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,910
This man

882
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,790
freed me

883
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:05,830
Raoul, we must find Hacha.

884
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,350
You are alone?

885
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,660
Yes, he is.

886
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,790
You are a brave man. Who are you?

887
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,990
My name is Major Vaughan.

888
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,070
I am a British officer.

889
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,870
You wanted the Marquesa's wagons?

890
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,830
I did.

891
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,910
We take the Marquesa home and you prisoner.

892
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,710
You could let me go, sir.

893
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,070
I cannot do that.

894
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,590
But will make you an offer

895
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,870
You give me your word
you will make no attempt to escape,

896
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,870
and you will be treated with the respect
due to your rank.

897
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,470
And if I don't, sir?

898
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,430
You will be taken under armed escort
to Santa Maria.

899
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,870
I promise you nothing of your treatment there.

900
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,190
Major Ducos is in change of prisoners
at Santa Maria

901
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,270
Give him your word, Vaughan.

902
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,740
He will set you free

903
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,790
in France

904
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,990
A house on the Seine

905
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,030
A life of a gentleman.

906
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,630
But no honor, Hélêne.

907
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,270
I cannot give you my word, sir.

908
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,670
Tant pis. Emmenez-le!

909
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,270
Votre garde! Surveillez à ton mec.

910
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,390
(Distant French chatter)

911
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,190
Par ici. Dépêchez-vous.

912
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,180
Sharpe.

913
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,390
- (Groans)
- (Laughs)

914
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,630
(Door locks)

915
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,550
NAIRN: Sergeant Harper coming, sir

916
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,590
Trouble?

917
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,630
It could be, sir.

918
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,670
Sharpe?

919
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,670
Could be, sir.

920
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,710
Fix it, then.

921
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:26,030
When we fight the French, I want nothing,
and I mean nothing to impede us.

922
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,550
- Did you get the Marquesa?
- Oh, we got her all right, sir.

923
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,670
But the French got us She got away.

924
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,990
- Where's Sharpe?
- The French have him at Santa Maria.

925
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,030
Do they know it's Sharpe?

926
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:52,430
- Actually, they think he's Major Vaughan, sir.
- Vaughan? The military prosecutor?

927
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:55,190
- The very man.
- Did he interrogate her?

928
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,710
Oh, he was at her all night, sir.

929
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,750
But did he find the answers?

930
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:03,670
Well, it appears Father Hacha and El Matarife
kidnapped the Marquesa

931
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,710
and forced her to write the letter.

932
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,870
But the man with all the answers is Major Ducos.

933
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,870
Ducos. Huh. Where is he, Sergeant?

934
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:13,630
Well, he's at Santa Maria too, sir.
In charge of Sharpe.

935
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,430
- He'll kill him, Sergeant.
- I'm going to get him out, sir.

936
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,710
- You can't do that.
- Why not? With respect, sir.

937
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,990
- The British army needs every man it has.
- The British army needs a lot of things, sir.

938
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,230
But what it does need is Major Sharpe.

939
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:29,350
- He might already be dead.
- (Chuckles) I've heard that one before, sir.

940
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,510
The army needs you, Sergeant.

941
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,550
And it needs the Chosen Men.

942
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,590
Me and the Chosen Men'll be back
in no time at all, sir.

943
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,630
Like the shees riding the wind.

944
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,670
See that you are, Sergeant.

945
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,550
Thank you, sir.

946
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,350
Hey! Look who's here!

947
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,110
Our baby.

948
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,110
Patrick?

949
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,580
Patrick José Hagman...

950
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:04,030
Cooper Harris Perkins

951
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,750
Harper.

952
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,550
She called him after the midwives!

953
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:23,110
(Whispers) Take care. Take care.

954
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,110
Come on.

955
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,310
COOPER: Sarge? Sarge

956
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,350
what's happening? Sarge!

957
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,350
Sarge, where are we off to?

958
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,820
We're going to join up
with a man called Sharpe, lads.

959
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,790
- You mean we're all going to die?
- No, Perkins, lad.

960
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:44,580
He may be dead in the eyes of the French,
but to you and me, he's as lively as an eel.

961
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:46,630
Just a minute!

962
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,550
- How, sarge?
- You know the army, boys.

963
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:52,310
They couldn't hang a curtain, even if they tried.

964
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,310
(Cheering and laughter)

965
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:57,350
(Whooping)

966
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,440
You are well, I hope?

967
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,870
(Groans)

968
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:23,190
(Sighs)

969
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,470
You will speak when you're spoken to.

970
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,190
That's the British way.

971
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,230
(Breathes heavily)

972
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,950
I am an officer of His Britannic Majesty's army.

973
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,670
And I demand treatment proper to my rank.

974
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,710
You're not an officer, Sharpe.

975
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,430
You were stripped of your rank by court martial.

976
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,790
You were pronounced dead.

977
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,830
And here you are now

978
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,550
a civilian,

979
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,630
masquerading, I believe, as Major Vaughan.

980
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,990
(Sighs)

981
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:09,150
One has to take care of spectacles, Sharpe...

982
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,910
...as you know.

983
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:23,030
You're a spy, Sharpe.

984
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,470
- I am a soldier.
- You're a spy Sharpe

985
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,070
Wellington himself faked your execution.

986
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:36,990
The Spanish army will be most interested
to hear this.

987
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,030
Why did you go to such lengths
to rescue the Marquesa?

988
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,070
It was her birthday.

989
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:49,110
I'd made her a cake.

990
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,950
(Groans)

991
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,710
You broke my spectacles, Sharpe.

992
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,230
Deliberately.

993
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,870
This is a very fine instrument.

994
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,990
From Wellington himself.

995
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,470
An eye for an eye, Sharpe.

996
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,430
Whoa!

997
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,510
(Yells)

998
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:38,830
There could be a couple of thousand of these
at Santa Maria.

999
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,670
There's five of us.

1000
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,670
Good odds, eh? What do you think?

1001
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,710
Sounds good to me, sarge.

1002
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:50,360
- Três bloody bon!
- Uniform, maintenant, eh!

1003
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:55,990
Would you believe me
if I said I don't wish you dead?

1004
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,990
No.

1005
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:01,510
It's true. You can live.

1006
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,430
You can walk out of here with your sword.

1007
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,950
We won't exchange you

1008
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,990
of course.

1009
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,830
You will spend the rest of the war in France.

1010
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:19,030
We might even civilize you.

1011
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,430
But then, it's your choice.

1012
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,550
Now,

1013
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,710
tell me, Sharpe,

1014
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:35,630
did the Marquesa seek for British help?

1015
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:43,910
(Sighs) You're bone-headed, Sharpe.

1016
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,950
Like all soldiers.

1017
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:49,790
She put you where you are,
and you will not answer the question?

1018
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,110
You put me where I am.

1019
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,270
I arranged the duel.

1020
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,510
But you don't know why

1021
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,950
Since you persist in dying, I will tell you.

1022
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,670
King Ferdinand of Spain
will sign a treaty with us,

1023
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:13,110
which will mean the British will be routed.

1024
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:17,630
It has the support of the Church
and of the noblemen of Spain.

1025
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:20,870
And all because

1026
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,910
you wanted to fight a duel?

1027
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,470
You're a fool Sharpe

1028
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:30,470
I counted on you being a fool.

1029
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,470
(Groans)

1030
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:37,510
(Gasps for breath)

1031
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,230
(Breathes heavily)

1032
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,830
Un deux Aez es gans!

1033
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,870
Come on, Perkins, lad. Moan.

1034
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:59,030
- (Perkins moans)
COOPER: Aye, go on. More. Go on.

1035
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,070
(Perkins moans)

1036
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,790
(Moaning continues)

1037
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,710
Blimey. They're going to blow this place

1038
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,030
to kingdom come.

1039
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,870
I have longed for this moment, Sharpe.

1040
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:41,390
Thought it had gone But you know what?

1041
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,100
I do believe there is a God after all.

1042
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,710
(Perkins groans)

1043
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,710
Eh! Où allez-vous?

1044
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:05,510
Qu'est-ce que vous faites ici?
Et où est votre supérieur?

1045
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,510
- Où allez-vous?
- Allez...

1046
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:12,510
...vite.
- Passez!

1047
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,870
(Groans)

1048
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:57,270
Get off, you daft... It's me! It's me!

1049
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,310
Hello, sir.

1050
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,350
- What kept you?
- I'm a father, sir.

1051
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:05,310
- A wee little boy. Patrick José Hagman Harris...
- Congratulations.

1052
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:07,150
I'll buy you a drink in Vitoria.

1053
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,950
(Neighing)

1054
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,030
Videz-moi ça là-haut.

1055
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:25,630
Là-haut Aez es gans!

1056
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,710
(Drumming)

1057
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:09,740
WELLINGTON: Three French armies
stand before us here at Vitoria.

1058
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,710
But on this occasion
we have the advantage of numbers

1059
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,590
There will be many deaths here
but we shall prevail

1060
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,980
And in so dong we will drive the French

1061
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,030
from Spain for ever

1062
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,470
Go on my lads!

1063
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:25,710
Complete your victory! They won't stand!

1064
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,750
(Drumming)

1065
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:50,150
Light Company...

1066
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:52,670
our orders are to attack

1067
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:55,910
and take that gun position to our flank there!

1068
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,030
Prepare to advance in skirmish order!

1069
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,110
The army will follow us!

1070
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:05,190
But you will follow me!

1071
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,070
Charge!

1072
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,110
ALL: Charge!

1073
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:12,190
(Explosions)

1074
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:17,300
Benedictus benedicat per Jesum Christum
dominum nostrum. Amen.

1075
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,990
You have failed me, priest.

1076
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:41,670
I do not understand.

1077
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,710
Sharpe is alive.

1078
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,350
The Marquesa is free. (Cocks gun)

1079
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,830
The English come

1080
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,110
Sharpe is dead! I saw him hang!

1081
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:53,750
Aargh!

1082
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,030
You call me a liar?

1083
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,470
(Explosions)

1084
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:11,270
(Neighing)

1085
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,710
(Explosions)
- Major Vaughan reporting, sir.

1086
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,870
Report.

1087
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:21,830
The French are trying to engineer a treaty
with King Ferdinand to drive us out, sir.

1088
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,510
Father Hacha is in it up to his neck.

1089
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,830
- Which I will break!
- Majon Ducos

1090
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:29,350
is behind it, sir.
He has letters of support from the Spanish.

1091
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:32,270
They were forced by Hacha and the Inquisition.
But he's running.

1092
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:33,550
With the letters?

1093
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:35,630
- Yes, sir.
- Go to your men Major Sharpe

1094
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:39,390
Resume command. Take the French guns and
punch a hole as big an army can go through.

1095
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:42,150
- ' Support you with artillery
- Yes, sir.

1096
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:44,030
Sharpe

1097
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,350
If you find the Marquesa, bring her to me.

1098
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:50,510
There are some questions
I would like to ask her.

1099
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:52,550
Sir.

1100
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,590
Chosen Men!

1101
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,750
(Neighing)

1102
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,750
(Explosion)

1103
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,750
Now, hold the line, boys! Hold the line!

1104
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,790
(Groans)

1105
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,950
South Essex! Stand firm!

1106
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,990
No retreat!

1107
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,670
Major Sharpe!

1108
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,520
- Mr. D'Alembord.
(Explosions)

1109
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,230
You've got 'em scared, lads!

1110
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:36,940
They know they'll be beaten. And now
they've got to face a ghost and his men!

1111
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,670
- (Laughter)
- Sergeant Harper.

1112
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,750
- Sir!
- Chosen Men to the front!

1113
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,470
Better French keep their heads down.

1114
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,120
- Light Company, form a column.
(Explosion)

1115
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,150
Follow me!

1116
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,950
Take that, Dan.

1117
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,990
Thank you, Rifleman Moore.

1118
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,510
(Yelling)

1119
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,340
Come on!

1120
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:40,260
(Roars)

1121
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:42,310
(Explosion)

1122
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:47,150
- Come on!
(Explosion)

1123
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,620
(Explosion)

1124
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,990
- Yes!
(All cheer)

1125
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:07,030
(Drumming)

1126
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:11,750
(Cheering)

1127
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,470
Yes!

1128
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:22,070
EL MATARIFE: La Marquesa

1129
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,750
Vamos.

1130
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:35,670
Allez!

1131
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,550
Pussez-vous devant!

1132
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,430
Pussez-vous

1133
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,190
Sharpe!

1134
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:43,150
SHARPE: Marquesa
HARPER: Look at this

1135
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,190
Young Patrick's inheritance.

1136
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,230
El Matarife!

1137
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:49,990
SHARPE: Matarife!

1138
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:06,070
You're a coward, Matarife.

1139
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:09,150
You only fight women

1140
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:10,710
(Rifles cocked)

1141
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,150
If they touch her, Pat,

1142
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:22,230
- put a bullet in 'em.
- That won't be a problem, sir.

1143
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,230
(Laughs)

1144
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:25,630
(Grunts)

1145
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:31,790
You must count the ways of your death.

1146
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,710
The dead don't count, Matarife.

1147
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:44,430
Oh, no? Hah!

1148
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:52,430
Come! Death wants you!

1149
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,390
(Cheering)

1150
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,030
Bastard.

1151
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:11,990
One, two,

1152
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,030
three!

1153
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:17,070
(Choking)

1154
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:20,310
You and your brother Father Hacha
work for the French.

1155
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:26,030
EL MATARIFE: No!
SHARPE: You both wonk for the French!

1156
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:27,510
Who killed the Marqués?

1157
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,830
- Who killed the Marqués?
- I did.

1158
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:34,270
Your brother was with you?

1159
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:37,150
- Yes.
- You were both paid by the French?

1160
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:39,190
- Yes.
- Did you hear him?

1161
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:40,990
Did you?

1162
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:42,870
(Choking)

1163
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:53,350
(Gunshot)

1164
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,750
Look after her, Pat.

1165
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,030
Lively fiddle music

1166
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:41,910
(Whooping)

1167
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:51,590
(Whooping)

1168
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,950
(Whooping)

1169
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:14,110
Scum of the earth, Nairn.

1170
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:19,270
But what damn fine fellows
we have made of them, sir.

1171
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:21,830
Quite.

1172
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,430
Hello.

1173
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:36,070
I wanted to give you this.

1174
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,790
As a debt of gratitude.

1175
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,550
Thank you.

1176
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,030
It's a beauty.

1177
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:55,950
Thank you for what you said.

1178
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:58,600
I didn't expect a British court to show such...

1179
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:03,430
...understanding.

1180
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:06,590
It wasn't me.

1181
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:09,430
Lord Wellington has a weakness
for a pretty face,

1182
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,470
that's all.

1183
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,430
So, you're free.

1184
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,550
(Laughs)

1185
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,550
I lost my husband,

1186
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:27,990
all my belongings, all my money.

1187
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:31,500
I am now despised by the Spanish

1188
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,550
and hated by the French.

1189
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,950
Not so free.

1190
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:41,550
I'm sure you'll find a new protector.

1191
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,710
I don't need a protector.

1192
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:53,270
What about you? What are you going to do now?

1193
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,790
I'm a soldier.

1194
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:00,260
I'll go where Lord Wellington tells me.

1195
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,950
Come visit me.

1196
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:06,990
In my house on the Seine.

1197
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:10,110
Lark pâté,

1198
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,350
and honey.

1199
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,590
Cold, cold wine,

1200
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,630
on a hot, hot day.

1201
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,070
We'll be passing through.

1202
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:23,110
I look forward to it.

1203
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:26,390
I have orders to move north.

1204
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:29,590
I'm just preparing to leave.

1205
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:31,630
I know

1206
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:35,910
You said once that you liked me.

1207
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:39,830
Aye. That's true.

1208
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:42,220
HARPER: Excuse me

1209
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:43,710
All set, sir.

1210
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:49,070
- I'll be right with you, Sergeant Harper.
- Yes, sir.

1211
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:53,670
Goodbye, Sharpe.

1212
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:35,870
SHARPE: Oh women like getting married
Patrick

1213
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:40,510
HARPER: I Know but why can't they just do it
like, and tell us about it afterwards huh?

1214
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:43,230
SHARPE: Are you sure
you want to go through with it?

1215
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:46,940
HARPER: Oh wouldn't let Ramona down now,
I'll do it at night.

1216
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,110
Just don't have to enjoy dong it.

1217
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:52,900
# Then fall in, lads, behind the drum

1218
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,150
# With colors blazing like the sun

1219
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,340
# Along the road

1220
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:00,390
# To come what may

1221
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:04,020
# Over the hills and far away

1222
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:08,070
# O'er the hills and o'er the main

1223
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:13,190
# Through Flanders, Portugal and Spain

1224
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:17,230
# King George commands and we obey

1225
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:22,510
# Over the hills and far away
