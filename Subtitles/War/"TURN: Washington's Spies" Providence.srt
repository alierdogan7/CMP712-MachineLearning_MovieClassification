This was torn from the loyal
exchequer's balance ledger.

3
00:00:05,023 --> 00:00:06,931
This seal must reach Versailles.

4
00:00:07,032 --> 00:00:09,113
I will depart from camp at once.

5
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:11,124
(heavy breathing)

6
00:00:11,225 --> 00:00:15,447
Fierce word to King George that
I would kill who ever saw this.

7
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:16,785
You wanted to be caught.

Male voice: You haven't learned a thing.

9
00:00:19,058 --> 00:00:22,170
If we get Hewlett back from Setauket
he can release Abe from prison.

10
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:23,480
I'll finish Hewlett.

11
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:24,347
Happy New Year major.

15, maybe 20 men.

20
00:01:04,246 --> 00:01:06,685
But it don't look like
regular army to me, you know?

21
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:12,296
Tallmadge. They went south.

22
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:14,301
Yeah, well, it doesn't
matter. We were too late.

23
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:17,646
We were late? No, we were lucky.

24
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:20,121
What, you wanted to turn
up in time for all of this?

25

The Lord's watching out for us, Ben.

26
00:01:23,526 --> 00:01:26,198
It's like that word your
father used to preach about.

27
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:27,799
What's that word?

28
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:30,371
- Providence.
- Yeah, providence.

29
00:01:30,405 --> 00:01:31,640
Look at that.

30
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,882
I found that on the lieutenant there.

31
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:37,753
Turns out Washington decided
to pardon Hewlett after all,

32
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:40,595
but the day before these
poor bastards executed him.

33
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:43,369
And in doing so they've all but signed

34
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,142
the execution order for Abraham in New York.

35
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,916
God, huh? God's watching?

36
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,291
- He's laughing at us.
- Hey, Abe isn't dead yet, all right?

37
00:01:52,326 --> 00:01:55,802
Without Hewlett's word, Abe will hang.

38
00:01:59,343 --> 00:02:02,083
- Three days.
- What?

39
00:02:02,117 --> 00:02:05,223
It'll take three days for news of
this to reach New York at least.

40
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:08,695
- Yeah, so?
- So we've got three whole days to get into the city,

41
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,765
break Woody out of jail, and
haul his ass back to safety.

42
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,334
- <i> Yeah, three whole days.</i>
- That's right.

43
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:15,870
Because it only took us three
months to properly infiltrate

44
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:17,774
a man onto the island in
the first place, right?

45
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:22,280

59
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:14,156

- Sir?
- Hewlett's no frontiersman.

61

-<i> all of his devices to Valley Forge.</i> 
- Mostly did.

80
00:04:53,313 --> 00:04:55,281
But not all his treasures
could fit in his wagon.

81
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:57,447
Including...

82
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,017
our way into New York Harbor.

83
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:05,318
- My God, is this...
- Yeah.

84
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:07,451
Davey Bushnell's underwater machine.

85
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:09,318
The Turtle, he calls it.

86
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:10,551
The Turtle?

87
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:13,588
I knew Bushnell at Yale.

88
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:15,290
I can't recall much about the man

89
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:17,057
other than stories that he exploded

90
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:18,757
kegs of gunpowder on the Mill River.

91
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,258
Like the one you're touching now?

92
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:24,693
150 pounds of powder fired by a gunlock.

93
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:27,362
You see, you yank that there

94
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:30,232
and then a watchwork timer,
it ignites the magazine.

95
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:33,568
Then you got 10 minutes to
row away before it goes boom.

96
00:05:33,603 --> 00:05:36,335
My God.

97
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,472
I thought that Sackett wouldn't
let you touch this thing.

98
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,141
Let's just say I grew on the bastard.

99
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,479
Yeah, I'm sure you did.

100
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:47,345
How on earth do you navigate
this while underwater?

101
00:05:47,378 --> 00:05:51,714
Ah, Ben Franklin suggested to Sackett

102
00:05:51,748 --> 00:05:53,946
to coat the gauges with foxfire.

103
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:55,248
You know, from dead trees.

104
00:05:55,282 --> 00:05:58,185
<i>So now the compass glows in the dark.</i>

105
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,217
And I'll be damned, Benny, but it works.

106
00:06:05,735 --> 00:06:08,299
All right.

107
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,835
All right, well, I'm coming with you.

108
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,838
Sorry, but it's a one-man craft.

109
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:16,672
Tight as a fish's arsehole in there.

110
00:06:16,706 --> 00:06:19,041
You can ride along on
the whaleboat if you like

111
00:06:19,075 --> 00:06:20,909
as it tows me into harbor,
but once we get close...

112
00:06:20,943 --> 00:06:22,577
Wait, if there's only room for one,

113
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:24,144
then how the hell do you get Abe back?

114
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:26,446
I said it was myay into New York, Ben.

115
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:28,249
Never said it was my way out.

116
00:06:29,618 --> 00:06:31,718
No, Caleb, I'm sorry. I
can't let you do this alone.

117
00:06:31,753 --> 00:06:33,786
That's all right, Benny.

118
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,787
'Cause I ain't asking your permission.

119
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:38,356
Our little spy ring might be done for,

120
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,957
but Abe is still alive.

121
00:06:39,992 --> 00:06:42,093
And you know I'd do the same for you.

122
00:06:42,128 --> 00:06:45,399
So let's get that bastard in the water.

123
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:50,867
This, gentlemen, will be
the last battle of the war.

124
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:53,195
You mean for them or for us?

125
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,130
Their ships will sail into the river
and reinforce the garrison.

126
00:06:56,164 --> 00:06:58,161
Yes, I should hope so.

127
00:06:58,196 --> 00:07:01,395
Our main force will
cross into Staten Island,

128
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,529
march up its eastern coast,

129
00:07:03,563 --> 00:07:05,193
and with their fleet occupied,

130
00:07:05,227 --> 00:07:08,961
you will be free to cross
the narrows into Brooklyn.

131
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,227
It's precisely what Howe
did not two years ago.

132
00:07:11,261 --> 00:07:13,594
I will take a good idea
wherever it comes from.

133
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:15,294
He did it in August, not the dead of winter.

134
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:17,895
All the more reason they
won't be expecting us.

135
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:26,501
I assure you, the whole of
the king's troops in New York

136
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:30,204
does not exceed 3,500 men.

137
00:07:33,672 --> 00:07:36,241
How did you come by this intelligence?

138
00:07:37,677 --> 00:07:40,747
Are you certain it's accurate?

139
00:07:40,782 --> 00:07:43,348
- Completely.
- ( whispers )

140
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:45,317
Because you risk the entire army.

141
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:48,887
If you're not up to leading
the men, Charles, then I will.

142
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,459
Excuse me.

143
00:08:05,671 --> 00:08:08,039
- Your Excellency.
- Marquis.

144
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,211
Tell me, Lafayette, did
Albany agree with you?

145
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,045
I confess I never made it there.

146
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,146
I was summoned to Boston instead.

147
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:21,381
Who summoned you?

148
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,586
Conrad Gérard, the new
emissary from Versailles.

149
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:28,856
I hope you expressed my deep regret

150
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:30,859
at the loss of his predecessor

151
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:33,963
as well as the vital
intelligence he was carrying.

152
00:08:33,997 --> 00:08:36,599
That was not the purpose of
the meeting, I assure you.

153
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:40,266
He wished me to convey a
message to you personally.

154
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:44,071
King Louis has commenced negotiations

155
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,973
with Messieurs Franklin and Adams

156
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:47,841
of the American delegation.

157
00:08:49,142 --> 00:08:50,441
Negotiations?

158
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:53,138
A treaty of alliance between France

159
00:08:53,172 --> 00:08:55,943
and the United States is imminent.

160
00:08:59,614 --> 00:09:02,979
The number of regulars
taken prisoner at Saratoga,

161
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:05,880
in particular, has earned
King Louis' support

162
00:09:05,914 --> 00:09:09,185
and the admiration of Parliament.

163
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:15,992

Would you stand back, William?

171
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:27,587
- Two. Two.
- Two sons? All right, just stop.

172
00:10:27,622 --> 00:10:28,755
Back off, all right?

173
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:30,589
Just back off. I can't breathe.

174
00:10:30,624 --> 00:10:32,791
If you want some counsel, you've just
got to give me some room, all right?

175
00:10:32,825 --> 00:10:35,228
I'm dealing with this gentleman
first. You, come here.

176
00:10:35,263 --> 00:10:38,431
All right, so, corruption of blood,
do you know what that means?

177
00:10:38,465 --> 00:10:40,999
- Man:<i> No.</i>
-<i> It means you cannot transfer your property</i>

178
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:42,800
<i>to your sons before the British seize it.</i>

179
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:44,669

Now, do you have a brother
that you can count on?

181
00:10:46,705 --> 00:10:48,338
He's the reason I'm here.

182
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:50,374
All right, well, a cousin, a relative...

183
00:10:50,408 --> 00:10:53,573
Don't believe a word that comes
out of this Tory bastard's mouth.

184
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:56,409
I'd rather be a Tory than a snitch, Gareth.

185
00:10:56,443 --> 00:10:57,711
Shut your gob, Gareth.

186

"King Louis to make treaty
with illegal Congress."

188
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:05,521
<i>The French have joined.</i>

189
00:11:05,556 --> 00:11:07,588
No, no. Where? Where? Where? Where?

Whatcha think of that, Woodhull?

192
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:12,393
I think it changes everything...

193
00:11:12,427 --> 00:11:14,629

Peggy: <i>The French? Are you certain?</i>

196
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,284
General Gates fears the French

197
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:26,352
will position their navy
between here and New York,

198
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,519
in which case we'll be cut off.

199
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:34,158
He's ordered the army to
evacuate Philadelphia.

200
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:39,096
You're leaving?

201
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,002
Well, New York has its charms.

202
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:47,734
Not that I'm quite certain what they are.

203
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:52,670
But I know we'll be happy there.

204
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:55,106
- We?
- I'm going with you.

205
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,142
Your father will never abandon this city.

206
00:11:57,177 --> 00:12:00,848
John, I am going with you.

207
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,257
You wish to elope?

208
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:12,797
I wish to be with the man I love.

209
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:14,832
I'll elope if I must.

210
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:17,097
It will make you a stranger to your family.

211
00:12:17,132 --> 00:12:19,333
They will shun you. They will disown you.

212
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:21,505
I don't care.

213
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:33,621
They may abandon you, but I won't.

214
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,724
Your husband will be your new family.

215
00:12:47,862 --> 00:12:49,729
Don't mind me.

216
00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:52,528
I'm just enjoying the show.

217
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,362

221
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:05,935
- And you would be, eh?
- Don't answer him.

222
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:07,503
I'll wait upstairs.

Ah. ( laughs )

224
00:13:09,603 --> 00:13:11,567
- John.
- Don't worry.

225
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:13,065
He won't test me any further.

226
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,965
He's smarter than he looks.

227
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:20,037
Oh, this Philly filly

228
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:22,840
ain't no common actress.

229
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,571
I smell a secret.

230
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:29,640
I find it hard to believe you
can smell anything past yourself.

231
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,848
Secrets can kill, you know, John.

232
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:38,519
<i>I have a license to kill anyone</i>

233
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:42,086
who's seen the secrets
on this piece of paper.

234
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,387
Do you want to take a peek?

235
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:46,555
Do you even know what this is, John?

236
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:48,358
According to the letter
I received from London,

237
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:50,462
I'm assuming it's the property of our king

238
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,198
stolen from his throne
room by an American spy.

239
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,303
And retrieved by me.

240
00:13:57,607 --> 00:13:59,975
What else has London told you?

241
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:03,048
Only that I'm to verify the seal
and witness you destroy it.

242
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:06,020
And see that I'm paid, John.

243
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,455
Ha!

244
00:14:07,489 --> 00:14:11,458
That part burns you just
a wee bit, doesn't it?

245
00:14:11,492 --> 00:14:13,963
I received the letter four months ago.

246
00:14:13,997 --> 00:14:16,864
I wonder what took you
so long to lay hand to it.

247
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,365
Well, I'd explain it to you,

248
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,068
but with your lack of field experience,

249
00:14:24,102 --> 00:14:27,903
I somehow doubt that
you'd comprehend a lick.

250
00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:29,637
Let's get this over and done with.

251
00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:31,438
I want my payment in gold.

252
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:33,707
I'm authorized to extend a line of credit.

253
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:36,309
In gold.

254
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,675
I'm off for the Northwest Passage.

255
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:41,111
Far away from this army.

256
00:14:41,145 --> 00:14:43,446
Far away from this war.

257
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,446
I somehow doubt that the
emperors of the Orient

258
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:49,714
will accept a letter of credit.

259
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,487
Give us a day to collect the bullion.

260
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,455
You can claim it at the customshouse.

261
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:04,163
It does burn you, doesn't it?

262
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:08,970

00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:31,340
The men are mindful of my leg, sir.

358
00:22:31,374 --> 00:22:33,644
But it gives them heart.

359
00:22:33,678 --> 00:22:35,612
It reminds them of victory

360
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:38,784
and the sacrifice that victory requires.

361
00:22:40,788 --> 00:22:43,158
I can fight.

362
00:22:43,192 --> 00:22:45,325
Let me prove it to you.

363
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,596
And I assure you that my glory
will not detract from your own.

364
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,734
It will only enhance it.

365
00:23:00,075 --> 00:23:03,677
This has nothing to do with glory.

366
00:23:06,115 --> 00:23:08,685
Says the glorified.

367
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:15,893
Right, right.

368
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,761
Guard: What the devil did you sail in?

369
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:21,134
Well, the inventor,
he called it an Infernal.

370
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:22,736
And by God, was he right.

371
00:23:22,771 --> 00:23:24,406
I sent a man for rope.

372
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,441
<i>Perhaps we'll hang you with it.</i>

373
00:23:26,476 --> 00:23:28,042
Doubt we'll have time for all that.

374
00:23:28,077 --> 00:23:30,147
What's that?

375
00:23:30,181 --> 00:23:34,221
Three, two, one.

would open up and spirit you away?

380
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:48,503
It's been 10 minutes by my count.

381
00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:50,772
Although arithmetic was never my strong...

More. More.

394
00:25:07,702 --> 00:25:09,671
Yes.

395
00:25:09,706 --> 00:25:13,108
Yes. Yes. Yes.

Yates: <i>Mr. Woodhull.</i>

401
00:26:09,617 --> 00:26:11,283
You have a visitor.

402
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:17,188
You're going to wish you had confessed.

403
00:26:21,525 --> 00:26:23,992
Yates: <i>He don't look like much, sir,</i>

404
00:26:24,026 --> 00:26:26,327
but he's a snake in the grass.

405
00:26:26,362 --> 00:26:29,801
Thank you, Warden. I'll take it from here.

406
00:26:38,382 --> 00:26:40,453
( Door closes )

407
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:45,527
Huh?

408
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,698
( Grunts )

409
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:51,603
- Look at you.
- ( chuckles )

410
00:26:51,637 --> 00:26:54,139
- Look at those whiskers.
- Where the hell did yours go?

411
00:26:54,173 --> 00:26:56,543
- Mine came off.
- ( laughs )

412
00:26:56,578 --> 00:26:58,645
What are you doing here?

413
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,881
What do you mean, what am I doing here?

414
00:27:00,915 --> 00:27:02,916
I'm here to save your bacon.

415
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,449
You're walking out that door today, huh?

416
00:27:05,484 --> 00:27:08,051
Right through the city gates
and all the way to Valley Forge.

417
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,819
- No.
- What?

418
00:27:09,853 --> 00:27:11,520
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

419
00:27:11,554 --> 00:27:12,887
- I mean you have to go.
- What?

420
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,988
- You have... shh.
- No. No.

421
00:27:15,023 --> 00:27:17,754
- What, without you?
- They still think I'm a Loyalist.

422
00:27:17,788 --> 00:27:20,391
- I've maintained innocence and my story.
- Abe, but...

423
00:27:20,427 --> 00:27:22,593
And when Hewlett gets traded
back and he writes to them,

424
00:27:22,628 --> 00:27:23,894
that story will be intact.

425
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:27,968
- You have to go.
- Listen, Hewlett is dead.

426
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:32,542
What?

427
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:35,013
He's dead.

428
00:27:35,047 --> 00:27:36,982
Are you... Are you certain?

429
00:27:38,017 --> 00:27:39,819
Are you certain?

430
00:27:39,853 --> 00:27:42,689
- I stood over his grave.
- ( sighs )

431
00:27:42,723 --> 00:27:45,827
Now look, we rode out to Connecticut

432
00:27:45,862 --> 00:27:47,497
to free him, right?

433
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:49,398
We did all we could.

434
00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:51,365
Washington even wrote the man a pardon,

435
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:53,401
but it was too late.

436
00:27:53,436 --> 00:27:56,502
Now look,

437
00:27:56,537 --> 00:27:58,571
Culper is dead.

438
00:27:59,707 --> 00:28:01,741
But you don't have to be.

439
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:06,542
Now let's get out of here.

440
00:28:06,577 --> 00:28:09,579
Come on. Come on.

441
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:12,815
- No.
- What are you doing?

442
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,084
- Abe...
- No, no, there is still a chance.

443
00:28:16,455 --> 00:28:19,125
Did you... did you not
hear what I just said?

444
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:21,227
If they were going to kill me,
they would have done it already.

445
00:28:21,262 --> 00:28:23,631
This place, this prison is a business.

446
00:28:23,665 --> 00:28:25,401
All right? Yates gets a stipend

447
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,037
for each person that's in here,
but it's not enough to turn a profit.

448
00:28:28,071 --> 00:28:30,338
So for that, he relies
on family gifts, bribes.

449
00:28:30,373 --> 00:28:33,909
Mary, she sends provisions, cutlery,

450
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:36,146
guineas every week like clockwork.

451
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,883
So if I die, so does his revenue, all right?

452
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:42,523
I'm not even sure if he's told the
commissary that I'm even a spy yet.

453
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:43,992
Do you know what I had to do to get in here?

454
00:28:44,027 --> 00:28:45,828
What the hell are you doing?
I didn't ask you to come here.

455
00:28:45,862 --> 00:28:48,798
I shaved off my beard for
you, you ungrateful shite.

456
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:52,333
- Well, you missed a spot.
- What are you doing?

457
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:55,035
Washington pardoned Hewlett.

458
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:57,904
That means that he still
holds out hope for me, for us.

459
00:28:57,938 --> 00:29:00,139
And now that the French
have joined our cause,

460
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:03,241
the British will relocate their
headquarters to New York.

461
00:29:03,276 --> 00:29:06,840
Our operation is needed
here now more than ever.

462
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:08,075
Do you understand?

463
00:29:09,377 --> 00:29:11,578
Lower the knife.

464
00:29:13,913 --> 00:29:16,812
Now you listen to me, Woodhull.

465
00:29:16,847 --> 00:29:19,650
If you do make it out of here
Tory bona fides and all,

466
00:29:19,684 --> 00:29:23,089
there is no way Samuel Culper can
skulk around in New York in the future.

467
00:29:23,123 --> 00:29:24,657
That's why we need a man here.

468
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:26,659
I've already told Ben about him.

469
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:29,429
- What, Townsley?
- Townsend.

470
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:31,831
His name's Townsend. He owns
a boardinghouse in the Bowery.

471
00:29:31,865 --> 00:29:33,732
I left my bag there before I was arrested.

472
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:36,601
- All right, slow down.
- Hidden in the bottom of it is a vial of invisible ink.

473
00:29:36,636 --> 00:29:38,102
You need to get that ink to him.

474
00:29:38,136 --> 00:29:40,102
You need to show him how to use it.

475
00:29:42,005 --> 00:29:43,206
What if he doesn't take it?

476
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:44,975
You're gonna have to convince him.

477
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:47,510
But I know this man.

478
00:29:48,512 --> 00:29:50,946
He is the answer to our problem.

479
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,350
And Culper is not dead.

480
00:29:53,385 --> 00:29:56,052
Neither is our ring.

481
00:29:58,887 --> 00:30:01,122
It's just not completed yet.

482
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:10,106
<i>( Clock ticking )</i>

483
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,576
<i>( fire crackling )</i>

484
00:30:22,856 --> 00:30:26,789
I pray you've not been attending
me this entire day, Mrs. Woodhull.

485
00:30:28,691 --> 00:30:30,725
It was no trouble.

486
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:33,225
How do you feel?

487
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,159
Oh, wretched.

488
00:30:35,193 --> 00:30:37,358
But I no longer despair.

489
00:30:42,726 --> 00:30:46,693
I never thought to have a roof over me.

490
00:30:46,727 --> 00:30:49,265
Never sleep in my own bed.

491
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:52,632
It's good to be home.

492
00:30:57,036 --> 00:30:59,403
Richard.

493
00:30:59,438 --> 00:31:01,905
Glad to see you, old friend.

494
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,474
I'm so sorry that you got
caught up in all of this, Richard.

495
00:31:05,508 --> 00:31:08,805
- You and your family.
- You have nothing to apologize for.

496
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,075
We recovered from it as will you.

497
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:13,541
And now, if there's anything
I can do to be of service...

498
00:31:13,576 --> 00:31:16,177
You already have. You've kept
the town running in my stead.

499
00:31:16,211 --> 00:31:20,045
- Well, it wasn't just me.
- No doubt young Abraham was helpful, too.

500
00:31:21,681 --> 00:31:24,952
Abraham remains in New York.

501
00:31:24,987 --> 00:31:26,654
<i>What?</i>

502
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:29,188
I take it his studies are going well.

503
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:33,091
He's been in prison this whole time.

504
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:36,228
They say he's been spying.

505
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:39,198
<i>But I know that this is some
kind of misunderstanding.</i>

506
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:43,100
Indeed there is, Mrs. Woodhull.

507
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:45,167
He was operating under my sanction.

508
00:31:45,202 --> 00:31:48,136
Have you not communicated
with the authorities, Richard?

509
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:51,473
As a father, I feared my testimony

510
00:31:51,508 --> 00:31:53,708
would be perceived as biased.

511
00:31:53,743 --> 00:31:57,178
Fortunately the major has no such bias.

512
00:31:57,212 --> 00:31:59,446
I will write to his jailers

513
00:31:59,481 --> 00:32:02,050
and order them to release him.

514
00:32:02,084 --> 00:32:06,750
But there is another matter
that I must attend to first

515
00:32:06,784 --> 00:32:09,454
now that I've recovered some strength.

516
00:32:16,295 --> 00:32:20,130
<i>- ( Carriage wheels rattling )
- ( horse neighs )</i>

517
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,198
I was thinking of taking some
of Mr. Franklin's inventions

518
00:32:26,232 --> 00:32:28,364
<i>as mementos from my time here.</i>

519
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:30,433
Is that really necessary, John?

520
00:32:30,468 --> 00:32:33,903
What better memento could you
have of this place than a wife?

521
00:32:39,547 --> 00:32:40,980
Something the matter?

522
00:32:41,014 --> 00:32:44,380
Not for me. It's for General Arnold.

523
00:32:44,414 --> 00:32:46,514
I would think he'd be
crowing about the French.

524
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:49,182
To the contrary. He seems melancholic.

525
00:32:49,216 --> 00:32:51,585
"I do not relish the coming of spring.

526
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,956
<i>I would prefer the hardships of the field</i>

527
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,656
<i>to the comforts of the city.</i>

528
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,522
Yet if glory is beyond my grasp,

529
00:32:57,556 --> 00:33:01,161
my sole consolation will be
to resume our acquaintance

530
00:33:01,195 --> 00:33:04,933
and cast my eyes upon you on a daily basis."

531
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:16,143
They're giving him Philadelphia.

532
00:33:17,111 --> 00:33:19,412
He's coming here?

533
00:33:22,318 --> 00:33:24,355
John, what's wrong?

534
00:33:25,723 --> 00:33:27,953
This could be a blessing in disguise.

535
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:30,857
Margaret...

536
00:33:30,891 --> 00:33:33,459
Why are you calling me that?

537
00:33:38,636 --> 00:33:41,138
I need you to remain here.

538
00:33:41,173 --> 00:33:44,977
To befriend Arnold and
make an introduction to me.

539
00:33:45,011 --> 00:33:47,612
Remain here?

540
00:33:47,646 --> 00:33:50,284
I... I thought we were going to be together.

541
00:33:50,318 --> 00:33:51,918
We shall be.

542
00:33:51,953 --> 00:33:54,188
And with the blessing of your father.

543
00:33:54,222 --> 00:33:57,490
<i>The man who contrives the
defection of Arnold will be lauded,</i>

544
00:33:57,524 --> 00:33:59,524
hailed as the savior of the colonies.

545
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:01,489
I'll be given land and title,

546
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:04,191
all the things your father thinks I lack.

547
00:34:05,595 --> 00:34:09,226
What if Benedict Arnold
doesn't want my friendship?

548
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,928
I suppose there's a first
time for everything.

549
00:34:10,963 --> 00:34:13,431
I mean, what if he wants something more?

550
00:34:14,465 --> 00:34:16,899
Peggy, you are an expert

551
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:19,870
in the art of fending off an ardent suitor.

552
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:21,903
And you can look to your father for help.

553
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:23,537
If he found my pedigree lacking,

554
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:27,074
I can only imagine what he would
think of an apothecary's son.

555
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:35,584
Peggy...

556
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:37,854
don't you understand?

557
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:40,193
We wouldn't have to elope.

558
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:45,165
Make me a man you can marry

559
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,432
and your father will give me your hand.

560
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:12,825
Planning to sketch me?

561
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:15,660
Trying to commit you to memory.

562
00:35:15,695 --> 00:35:18,994
You have drawings of me, but I
have nothing to remember you by.

563
00:35:40,483 --> 00:35:42,983
My great-great-grandmother
was forbidden to marry

564
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:44,885
the man she loved, yet
they ended up together.

565
00:35:44,919 --> 00:35:46,754
Then there is precedent.

566
00:35:46,788 --> 00:35:49,190
She wed him in secret.

567
00:35:49,224 --> 00:35:50,625
They were Quakers.

568
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:53,060
They didn't require a
meetinghouse or a clergyman,

569
00:35:53,094 --> 00:35:57,435
just a simple vow such as we are married.

570
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,604
And it wouldn't matter that
there were no witnesses,

571
00:35:59,638 --> 00:36:02,572
- for the only ones needed to be...
- We are married.

572
00:36:05,245 --> 00:36:07,446
If you'll have me, that is.

573
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:13,016
Yes, we are married.

574
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,009
<i>( Wind whistling )</i>

575
00:36:42,044 --> 00:36:44,579
<i>( horse neighing )</i>

576
00:36:45,748 --> 00:36:47,116
<i>( lock clicks )</i>

577
00:37:03,523 --> 00:37:06,011
<i>( Birds screeching )</i>

578
00:37:11,123 --> 00:37:13,423
Anna: <i>I'm sorry, we've closed.</i>

579
00:37:13,457 --> 00:37:15,991
<i>( silverware clinking )</i>

580
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:18,762
I've just returned from a long journey.

581
00:37:18,796 --> 00:37:21,465
I'm in need of a drink.

582
00:37:22,535 --> 00:37:25,140
Where is the major?

583
00:37:25,174 --> 00:37:27,809
Perhaps you should be seated.

584
00:37:29,244 --> 00:37:31,080
He didn't return?

585
00:37:31,114 --> 00:37:34,252
I did my best, Mrs. Strong.

586
00:37:34,287 --> 00:37:36,521
The brutes murdered
Hewlett before we arrived.

587
00:37:36,555 --> 00:37:38,457
- ( Crying )
- My sole consolation

588
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:40,862
was meting out the same rough
treatment they'd given him.

589
00:37:40,897 --> 00:37:42,867
I even sustained this wound.

590
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:44,736
( Sobbing )

591
00:37:48,809 --> 00:37:51,546
I'm here to console you

592
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,416
if you so require.

593
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,550
You're not alone.

594
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,454
Good evening, Mrs. Strong.

595
00:38:10,894 --> 00:38:12,929
I thought you were lost.

596
00:38:12,963 --> 00:38:15,462
I feared for you, too.

597
00:38:17,868 --> 00:38:19,804
Major.

598
00:38:23,305 --> 00:38:26,407
- This is...
- Somewhat of a surprise?

599
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:32,411
I did everything I could to rescue you,

600
00:38:32,446 --> 00:38:34,615
as my men will attest.

601
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,656
I have no doubt of it.

602
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,827
But I outwitted the rebels

603
00:38:43,861 --> 00:38:45,529
and escaped.

604
00:38:47,131 --> 00:38:48,765
Were you injured, Captain?

605
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:51,470
Was it the young rebel lieutenant?

606
00:38:51,504 --> 00:38:54,274
An adversary of no consequence.

607
00:38:54,309 --> 00:38:55,743
Hmm.

608
00:38:55,778 --> 00:38:59,316
Well, it is a pity that
you sustained an injury.

609
00:39:00,651 --> 00:39:03,621
I do hope that it didn't cut too deeply.

610
00:39:10,093 --> 00:39:14,663
Mrs. Strong, I have come to
escort you back to Whitehall.

611
00:39:14,697 --> 00:39:18,233
That is, if you are ready to travel.

612
00:39:18,267 --> 00:39:20,168
I'll gather my things.

613
00:39:33,447 --> 00:39:35,549
( Metal squeaking )

614
00:39:35,688 --> 00:39:40,512

Your king is waiting.

Northwest passage ain't
gonna discover itself.

622
00:40:07,682 --> 00:40:09,448
As you wish.

623
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:22,265
Your mission must remain a secret.

624
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:28,870
You may collect your reward.

625
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,972
Right through there.

626
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:47,388
How about you get it for me?

627
00:40:47,422 --> 00:40:48,756
Hmm?

628
00:40:51,093 --> 00:40:53,092
Very well.

629

Who is the coward behind this?

636

Was it André?

637
00:41:45,977 --> 00:41:50,147
You wouldn't dare hatch this on your own,

00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:52,315
you pissant!

00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:54,585
