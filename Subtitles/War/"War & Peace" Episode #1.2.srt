of the Austrian army at Ulm, yes,

The French advance was stopped long

my wish is never to leave you.

There, there!

00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:35,027
My dear Princess, this is
a moment I shall never forget.

347
00:24:35,077 --> 00:24:38,108
Will you not give me a little hope
of touching so great,

348
00:24:38,158 --> 00:24:40,068
so generous a heart?

349
00:24:40,118 --> 00:24:41,551

351
00:24:47,078 --> 00:24:50,867
Princess Marya, I do hope
I haven't offended you in any way?

352
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:53,072
May I not return and try again?

353

I shall never be your son's wife.

to see their eager faces.

I think we should have
a great victory tomorrow.

370
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:57,974
With respect, your Majesty,
we should not engage with Napoleon

371
00:25:58,024 --> 00:26:01,117
at all tomorrow, or any time soon.

372
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:04,812
Bonaparte has withdrawn his troops.
He's asked for talks.

373
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:07,308
He's desperate to avoid a battle.
All my generals are in agreement

379

Any more retreat
would be humiliation.

too old for this game, Kutuzov.

What do you think will happen
tomorrow, your Grace?

385
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:43,504
I think we will lose this battle
and a great many men will die.

Kutuzov! Why have you not advanced?

414

Because that's what Napoleon
wants us to do, your Majesty.
