1
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,277
(Muffled Explosions)

2
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,030
It has been reported that the
Nazi ﬂeet of U-boats exceeds 500.

3
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,557
Hitter knows how near disaster Britain was
in the last war in 1917

4
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,950
when the U-boat menace all but
strangled our supply lanes on the sea.

5
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,598
We are an island people.

6
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,672
We cannot survive
without our communications across the sea.

7
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,716
Hitler knows this only too well.

8
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,156
These pictures
from another captured German newsreel

9
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,028
bring home with vivid reality the daily
and nightly threat to all our shipping.

10
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,235
That, gentlemen, is what we've got to stop.

11
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,439
It may seem incredible but there is at the
moment one reason why we cannot stop it.

12
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Tirpitz.

13
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,519
Tirpitz is lying 60 miles inland
up a Norwegian fjord

14
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,593
And because of the threat
she constitutes, we

15
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,698
have to keep half a fleet
watching out for her.

16
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,352
Wasted ships, gentlemen.

17
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,512
Ships that we urgently need
to protect our Atlantic convoys.

18
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,319
The Royal Air Force have made
two attacks without success.

19
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,158
The cliffs of the fjord
are so steep that she

20
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:56,184
might as well be lying
in an air-raid shelter.

21
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,993
Somehow, gentlemen,
Tirpitz has got to be put out of action.

22
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,115
How?

23
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,354
[Emma]; Human torpedos, sir.

24
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,513
Two men riding across the North Sea
sitting on half a tonne of high explosive?

25
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,192
It's not practical.

26
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,354
Yes, Fraser?

27
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,037
It is practical, sir.

28
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,192
Nobody here seems to realise
how simple such an operation could be.

29
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,599
Hardly

30
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,913
I've got the men, sir.

31
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,356
Give us the machines and we'll put
Tirpitz out of action for you.

32
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,273
You seem very sure of
that, Commander Fraser.

33
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,874
Yes, sir. I'm sure of it.

34
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,075
- Mr Corbett.
- Yes, sir.

35
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,799
Volunteered from shore base, didn't you.
Yes, sir.

36
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,952
- Too much paper and not enough work, eh?
- Yes, sir.

37
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,996
Well, I dare say we can alter that.

38
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,156
- Mr Duffy.

39
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,830
- What's that?
- It's a pullover, sir.

40
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,358
- As worn in the Australian
Navy, I suppose. - No, sir.

41
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,396
Not in this Navy either, Mr Duffy.

42
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,676
[HEEL) Now listen.

43
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,672
just because you volunteered
for special service,

44
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,675
it doesn't mean you can dress up in fancy
clothes like a bunch of fighter pilots.

45
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,988
Remember that.

46
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,433
How old did you say you
were, Mr Abercrombie?

47
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,670
‘19, sir.

48
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,513
- Looking for a bit of excitement?
- Yes, sir.

49
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,479
Well, you won't have to look far in
this outfit. It'll come slap at you.

50
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,515
We were together in the Med, Ramsey,
weren't we?

51
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,749
Yes, sir.

52
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,115
- How's the wife?
- OK now, sir.

53
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,555
- Boy or girl?
- Boy, sir.

54
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,596
Good for you.

55
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,955
Smart.

56
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,634
Are you going to like this
any better than being a steward?

57
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,676
Dunno, sir, yet.

58
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,593
- You'll give us a try, eh?
- Try anything once, sir.

59
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,874
We've served together before, Hutchins,
haven't we?

60
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,269
- Yes, sir.

61
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,920
- Married yet?
- No, sir.

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,558
Not found the perfect woman, eh?

63
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,995
- They're all perfect to me, sir.
- Yeah.

64
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,433
Well, keep your mind on the job.

65
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,317
- This job, Hutchins.
- Yes, sir.

66
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,396
(Distant hooter)

67
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,313
No offence to present company

68
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,446
but only an English RN
officer would think of

69
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:38,384
putting up that, and
filling it with water!

70
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,640
All right, the order of
ascent will be Mr Duffy,

71
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,472
Mister Corbet,

72
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,754
Mr. Abercrombie

73
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,319
- You all right, Ramsey?
- Chief.

74
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,435
- Smart.
- Chief.

75
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,158
- Leading Seaman Hutchins.
- Chief.

76
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,196
Right, class ready.

77
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,997
Now, don't forget, breathe out.

78
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,800
- Good. I'll go and see how they are.
- Yes, sir.

79
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,156
Whoa.

80
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,353
Old Tom marched in
as if he was going to the gallows.

81
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,908
What about you, Digger?
You went green all over.

82
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,639
I feel as if I hadn't spent a penny
since Christmas.

83
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,915
- Cheer up, Ernie. It's all over now.
- Whoo.

84
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,877
200 stairs.

85
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,916
Next time I'm coming up your way.

86
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,359
Any casualties?

87
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,112
ALL: No, sir.

88
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,156
We must think up something
else, mustn't we?

89
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,992
Thank you very much, sir.

90
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,071
All right, gentlemen? Now the other arm.

91
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,752
Come on, Stan, push!

92
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,593
- Push.
- I am pushing.

93
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,558
- Nice and comfy, sir?
- Ha, blimey.

94
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,872
- It'll be better when you get in the
water, sir. - Well, it couldn't be worse.

95
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,996
Come on. This could be an emergency.

96
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,798
It is an emergency ,sir.

97
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,836
Right, heads up!

98
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,196
Right?

99
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,316
Push!

100
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,038
- How is it, Stan?
- (Muffled) Lovely.

101
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,838
- Eh?
" Lovely!"

102
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,717
- Oh.
- Fits you like a glove, boy.

103
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,074
All right, get ‘em aboard.

104
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,715
See any mermaids, Tom?

105
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,518
Yes. Two. But they wouldn't
look at anything under a Commander.

106
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,396
Ah.

107
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,634
- Get a move on, Mr Duffy, sir.
You're next. - (Abercrombie laughs)

108
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,391
Morale...

109
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,396
..is at its highest level.

110
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,036
What is needed now...

111
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,876
is more machines...

112
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,438
and real agressive action.

113
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,316
Stand to attention!

114
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,908
- Stand them at ease, please.
- Stand at ease.

115
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,568
Now, I want to read you
part of a letter that

116
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:01,583
I received from the
Admiralty this morning.

117
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,835
With reguards to your request
for aggressive action

118
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,354
to be carried out by the
Mark I Human Torpedo,

119
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,395
it has never been naval policy
to risk life unnecessarily,

120
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,278
with untried and experimental weapons.

121
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,478
The Mark I Human Torpedo
is an unproven machine.

122
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,717
You are reminded, moreover,
that her crew are unproven also.".

123
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,556
And don't look so damn
sorry for yourselves.

124
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,589
You see that?

125
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,913
The Admiralty
oughtn't to write us this sort of a letter,

126
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,709
especially when the Home Fleet's
exercising on our doorstep.

127
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,119
(Whistle)

128
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,872
(Hooter)

129
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,994
- You all set?
- Yes, sir.

130
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,957
Now listen...

131
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,999
they've got two anti-submarine nets out
and one anti-torpedo.

132
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,672
And watch out for the patrol boat.

133
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,957
- Sounds as if they knew we were coming.
- That's just normal procedure.

134
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,397
Now, I want all charges laid by 2230 hours.

135
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,074
And I want you all in and out by that time.

136
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,513
- All right?
- Yes, sir.

137
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,434
Now, don't forget, you've got to dive
at least a mile from the target.

138
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,919
And it's not going to be easy.

139
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,115
Well?

140
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,758
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

141
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,957
- Er, I suppose they are dummy charges.
- Oh, yes, sir.

142
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,271
Good. Because I'm going to be
sitting right on top of them.

143
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,796
Hey, feeling all right, cobber?

144
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:32,855
Fine.

145
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,348
Steward's delight, this
is, blowing up Admirals.

146
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,236
- All set?
- Lovely.

147
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,912
Come on.

148
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,037
We'll be there and back
before those boys get through the nets.

149
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,516
The admirals' waiting for you, sir.

150
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,792
I suppose you've come to pester
me about your toy submarine.

151
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,189
Oh, hardly pester, sir.

152
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,272
I don't mind admitting quite frankly
that I'm again ‘em.

153
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,679
Oh, sorry to hear that, sir.

154
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,716
I think you may be proved wrong.

155
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,993
Now you're talking, my boy.

156
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,514
Conjecture and enthusiasm are one thing.

157
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,670
Proofs an entirely
different kettle of fish.

158
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,875
Yes, sir.

159
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,189
Thank you, sir.

160
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,033
(Sighs) Roll on 12 o'clock.
Lets get turned in.

161
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,955
The Italians have tried them
in the Mediterranean

162
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,600
but they've been
playing about with toy subs for years.

163
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,795
Whereas...

164
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,235
- What's the matter, Fraser?
- Nothing, sir.

165
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,880
- Not boring you, am l?
- Oh, Lord, no, sir.

166
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,155
Then stop fiddling with
that infernal watch.

167
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,196
Oh, sorry, sir.

168
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,708
What exactly did you want to see me about?

169
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,119
Er...

170
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,758
W-W-Well...

171
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,193
N-Nothing in particular, sir.

172
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,319
L-l just wanted your general views
on the tactical uses of the chariots.

173
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,956
(Sighs)  I'll be quite blunt.

174
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,673
I don't think they have any tactical use

175
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,751
while they remain an unknown quantity.

176
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,115
- Unproven.
- Yes, sir.

177
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,679
You uh...

178
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,274
- You think I ought to give you proof, sir?
- Undoubtedly.

179
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,395
(Explosion)

180
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,629
(Second explosion)

181
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,910
- What the devil's that?
- The proof, sir.

182
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,353
- Proof?
- Yes, sir.

183
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,670
Those were dummy charges
on the hull of this ship.

184
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,278
If they hadn't been dummies, you'd be
on the bottom now, sir, for the duration.

185
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,715
Damn fine show, Winley. 100%.

186
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,994
I think we've sold it.

187
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,957
It's Mr Abercrombie and Ramsey, sir.

188
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,634
- Aren't they back?
- Yes, sir.

189
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,071
- They all right?
- They will be, sir.

190
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,994
Wouldn't have been so funny if we'd had to
kill a man to get our own way, would it?

191
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,514
Have we got our own way, sir?

192
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,556
Yeah.

193
00:16:43,935 --> 00:16:44,935
.Fraser.

194
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,916
Goodbye-

195
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Sir.

196
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,669
- Smart.
- Yes, sir.

197
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,910
Could I speak to you for a moment, sir?

198
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,956
Well, of course. What's on your mind?

199
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,951
I'm sorry to trouble you so late, sir.

200
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,395
Oh, it's not late.

201
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,755
I've thought about this a lot, sir.

202
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,479
And I thought that if I
could speak to someone...

203
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,316
I'm scared, sir.

204
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,516
- Of diving?
- Yes, sir.

205
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,114
I'm all right, sir, I'm quite all right,
until I feel the water pressing down on me.

206
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,192
And then I sort of panic inside, like.

207
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,589
- I haven't noticed it.
- No, sir.

208
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,796
That's the point, surely.
I haven't noticed it.

209
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,394
- It's still there, sir. And I felt...
- Cigarette?

210
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,074
Oh, thank you very much, sir.

211
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,197
Now, there are two kinds of courage,
aren't there?

212
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,193
One fellow's brave
because he doesn't know what fear is.

213
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,396
The other fellow's brave...

214
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,472
because he's afraid and fights
it and doesn't show it.

215
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,755
Supposing I couldn't fight it, sir?

216
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,593
Supposing we got in a
jam and I lost my head.

217
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,910
There's two of us on them
things, isn't there?

218
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,752
Hm

219
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,995
You're not the only one who's come to me
with this story, you know.

220
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,479
- I'm not, sir?
- Far from it.

221
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,391
You don't think I ought to back out, then?

222
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,109
- Do you want to back out? That's
the real question. - No, sir, I don't.

223
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,474
It... Well...

224
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,552
It sort of facinates me in
spite of being scared stiff.

225
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,677
I tested Cassidy, you know,
with Chief Petty Officer Chubb.

226
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,877
- Yes, sir. I know.
- Frankly, I was scared stiff, too.

227
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,436
Thank you, sir.

228
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,312
Whump. She's a goner.

229
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,668
How's that?

230
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,035
If you put a charge there my boy,
you'll be a genius.

231
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,998
- Right on the captain's backside.
- Attention.

232
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,638
Right, carry on, Chief.

233
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,075
Here he is. Lieutenant Anderson.

234
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,878
Royal Norweigan Naval Reserve

235
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,269
I'm very happy to be here.

236
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,879
He spent the last two years in Norway

237
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,428
and he's got some very interesting things
to tell us.

238
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,236
- Abercrombie.
- Sir.

239
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,559
Well, cheer up.

240
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,552
- Some of us have to stay behind, you know.
- Yes, sir.

241
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,312
Incidentally,

242
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,470
even if you hadn't done that,

243
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,516
I still wouldn't have
sent you on this trip.

244
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,955
You took some pretty big
risks the other night.

245
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,270
Pamsey didn't say anything,
but I can guess.

246
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,635
I tried to get under the net, sir.

247
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,517
- In the deepest part?
- Yes, sir.

248
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,556
- Why?
- Well, we...

249
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,598
I wanted to get in there first, sir.

250
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,671
Damn nearly killed yourself doing it.

251
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,513
- Ramsey, too.
- I know, sir. I'm very sorry.

252
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,953
I'm not organizing a race.

253
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,110
These things are planned operations.

254
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,952
I want a team.

255
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,076
Not a lot of characters
out collecting gongs.

256
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,517
Now, you can kill yourself any time you
like but don't go killing other people.

257
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,556
Pamsey's got a wife and kids.

258
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,716
- All right?
- Yes, sir.

259
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,751
FRASER: Tirpitz

260
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,432
Now, you can see

261
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,476
that she lies a long way inland.

262
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,756
60 miles to be exact.

263
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,189
And every yard of it is going to be tricky.

264
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,191
Damn tricky.

265
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,755
There'll be German patrol boats,
shore batteries and all the rest of it.

266
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:17,636
But your main danger may well be that, in a
flat calm, anyone who looks closely enough

267
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,076
will be able to see the chariot
secured below the water line.

268
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,360
And don't forget,

269
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,431
you'll be sailing in a very small boat.

270
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,750
She's unarmed.

271
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,549
And you're going to go through one of the
best defended stretches of water we know.

272
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,079
The Ingebord will have forged papers
showing that she's a Norwegian ﬁshing boat

273
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,789
on passage from Edoy to Trondheim
with a cargo of peat.

274
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,436
(Thudding)

275
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,228
- She's loose.
- Sounds like it.

276
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,356
SMART: Oi!

277
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,708
I think number two's adrift forward.

278
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,313
She's pulling to port.

279
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,197
Can you go down and fix it?

280
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,633
I can try.

281
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,790
I'd better find you some calmer water.

282
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,916
Big wrench. Quick!

283
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,915
Boat approaching!

Here, what about Tom?

288
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,958
Leave that to me. Get below.

Sven.

291
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,550
If Mr Corbett tries to
come aboard, stop him.

292
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,154
- It does not matter how, just stop him.
- Ja.

(Thudding) She's loose again.

Can't tell.

310
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,270
Only 15 minutes.

311
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,874
ANDERSON:
Trondheim‘s on the starboard beam now.

312
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,279
That means Tirpitz.

313
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,316
Less than 10 miles away.

314
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,236
(Thudding)

315
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,151
Can you attack in this weather?

316
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,028
- We can attack in any weather.
- It'll be dead calm on the bottom.

317
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,669
Better finish getting dressed.
The less we hang about, the better.

Port chariots a goner.
Not even a shackle left.

That means both of them gone.
Starboard snapped clean as a whistle.

324
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,031
Tirpitz is over there.

325
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,951
If it was light, we could see it.

326
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,918
I'd like to get my hands on the blokes
who made those bolts.

327
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,956
Could have reached her easy.

328
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,870
We have no papers for the return voyage.

329
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,916
Then we'll have to scuttle her.

330
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,113
Well, boys, let's go for a walk.

331
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,953
Who's for Sweden? (Whistles)

332
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,716
See anything?

333
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,153
No.

334
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,629
But at this time
they're probably in the guardhouse.

335
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,790
There must be a guard,
so near the frontier.

336
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,836
Ja.

338
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,751
Ja. Right to the top.

Oh, my poor feet.

00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,354

- No, it's not time.

00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,477

00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,752
- Two eggs, Stan?
- It's a deal.

348
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,909
Right, you're on.

349
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,673
I'd say we'll be due for leave
when we get back after this.

350
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,194
Oh, you've got it bad, haven't you?

351
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,430
Well, being married's different somehow.

352
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,794
You're telling me.

353
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,155
I had three years of it.

354
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,037
- Married?
- Yep.

355
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,348
Three years‘ hire.

356
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,079
She gave me me push.

357
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,116
That was bad luck, Duffy.

358
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,589
Well, maybe I chose the wrong girl.

359
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,636
What happened?

360
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,073
I bored her.

361
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,038
Anyway, she found the other boys
more interesting.

362
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,993
- Sorry, Duff.
- I'm not.

363
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,674
Oh, hell, cobber,
you get leave and enjoy yourself.

364
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,193
Pay no attention to Uncle Duffy.

365
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,556
- Who said leave? - Don't tell
me you want to get married, too?

366
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,198
He's got about six wives already.

367
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,599
I wish I had.

368
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,194
You need to lay off
the oatmeal stout and whelks, mate.

369
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,236
Right, It's time we go now.

370
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,870
Where's the actual frontier?

371
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,552
There.

372
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,153
The top of the mountain.

373
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,754
Will the Swedes intern us?

374
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,833
Let us reach Sweden first,
and then worry about that.

375
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,556
Cor, I couldn't half fancy that.

376
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,039
The cook or the cooking?

377
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,879
(Dog barks)

378
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,238
- (Whispers) Shoo. Shoo. Good boy.
- (Dog barks)

379
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,594
My last. Here.

380
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,836
We go now.

381
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,716

Hier, bitte.,

385
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,668
Mit kommen!

386
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,069
Jawohl.

387
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,310
At the next post, I'll drop. You get him.

388
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,390
At the next post, you take the front one.

389
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,190
- (Cries out)
- Here.

390
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,356
Argh!

391
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,952
Quick. There will be others.

392
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,315
Come on, quick!

393
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,316
Right.

394
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,876
- Keep still.
- (Coughs)

395
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,996
Hang on, mate. I want a steak
and chips out of you, remember.

396
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,036
- With two eggs?
- Yeah.

397
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,113
Could you manage a double whack?

398
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,037
What happens?

399
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,192
- I don't know. - Probably stick
us in the nick for the duration.

400
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,236

401
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,156

Him

405
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,237
What did he say?

406
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,757
He says arrangements will be made as soon
as possible to fly us back to Scotland.

407
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,478
- Fly us back to...
- But I...

408
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,312
I thought neutrals were supposed to...

409
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,756
These days no people are neutral.

410
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,070
Well, now that you lot are back from
your winter sports holiday in Sweden,

411
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,310
maybe we can settle down
and get some work done.

412
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
(Laughter)

413
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,477
Because this time we've got a
real striking power in our hands.

414
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,395
A midget submarine.

415
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,597
You'll attack sitting in it, not on it.

416
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,114
And when l say attack, l mean attack.

417
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,833
The midgets carry four
tonnes of high explosive.

418
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,314
We‘re going to blow such a hole in
Tirpitz, she‘ll never move again.

419
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,517
Quite comfortable down there?

420
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,034
It will be, Chief,
when Smart finds room for his feet.

421
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,599
Sorry about that, sir.

422
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,636
My head's not in your way, is it, sir?

423
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,149
- Diver in position.
- Yeah, about time too.

424
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,629
You're the only one who
can stand up straight.

425
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,233
I could if I was six inches shorter.

426
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,073
- Who's your No.1?
- Abercrombie. He's down here.

427
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,071
- He all right?
- Well, he is at the moment.

428
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,197
But he's a growing lad. I doubt if
we'll get him out in an hour's time.

429
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,158
- Where's that mad Irishman?
- Yeah. No engineer, Chief.

430
00:35:53,695 --> 00:35:54,695
McCleery.

431
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,676
Aye, Chief.

432
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,592
- Hello, right on my barnet!
- Sorry, Ernie, boy.

433
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,839
What's the matter with X3?

434
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,876
- I'll ram ‘em and sink ‘em if they
don't hurry up. - All clear, sir.

435
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,269
- Everybody OK? No.1?
- Aye aye, sir.

436
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,713
- Engine?
- All set, sir.

437
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,314
- Diver?
- Spare a penny for the diver, sir.

438
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,392
Now, that's an idea. How do you
spend a penny in this contraption?

439
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,076
Lower purchase.

440
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,199
Carefully.

441
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,236
Handsomely.

442
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,834
- We don't want to blow the dockyard up.
- No, sir.

443
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,876
Stop purchase.

444
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,074
Right,

445
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,396
(Hooter)

446
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,679
- Is it clear now?
- Yeah.

447
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,594
Hey!

448
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,949
- I thought they gave
you three weeks.

449
00:37:11,975 --> 00:37:14,422
- They did. I knew it was
too good to be true.

450
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,316
Nobody gets three weeks
leave out of this navy.

451
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,516
Unless they're too sick to stand up.

452
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,875
- What's new?
- That is.

453
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,996
Why, it's a side cargo.
I've seen it before.

454
00:37:25,022 --> 00:37:27,103
Yes, except that the
others were dummies.

455
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,388
- This isn't.
- (Clang)

456
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,472
Don't hit it, son. Two tons of
amatol makes an awful big bang.

457
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,314
No amount of hitting will affect it,
but we've heard nasty stories about leaks.

458
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,073
- Leaks in a side cargo?
- Sets it off.

459
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,116
Hey, there's another bit of news, too.

460
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,634
When we do go in,
the old man will lead the attack.

461
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,948
Yes, but when?

462
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,600
- Why muck up our leave?
- Better ask him yourself.

463
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,159
You're early, aren't you?
You weren't due back till 2359.

464
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,390
- Keen, sir. That's us.
- Good, start right away.

465
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,916
- Chubb, give these boys net
cutting practice. - Aye aye, sir.

466
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,996

- Biscuits.
- Oh, biscuits.

475
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,632
You'll be bored stiff in
peace time after this.

476

There are worse things than being bored.

- Right.

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,835
She'll probably pass you up, anyway,

ADMIRAL: The passage across the North Sea
will be made under tow.

His Majesty's submarines
Tiger, Tomahawk and Striker

506
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,278
are detailed for this operation.

507
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,830
The attack will be carried out

508
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,550
Commander Fraser Royal Navy, In X1,
will take charge of the entire operation.

509

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,038
Together

519
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,156
- Group down.
- Group down.

520
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,310
- Blowing up a bit, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

521
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,356
We're in the right submarine, then.

522
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,557
I wouldn't be a passage crew
for all the gin in Pompey.

523
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,077
- Depth?
- 7O feet.

524
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,391
- About time for our breath of air,
isn't it? - About half an hour yet.

525
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,038
Cor, what a job.

526
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,917
All the work and none of the glory.

527
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,309
Well, someone's got to do it.

528
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,356
"What did you do in the war, Dad?"

529
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,670
"I was towed across the North Sea."

530
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,638
"Sitting on my um... fat bottom, son."

531
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,994
Oh, ta, sir.

532
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,316
"ANNOUNCEMENT". Check A inboard vent.

533
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,868
Check A inboard vent.

534
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,236
(sighs)

535
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,038
I don't like leaving her behind.

536
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,314
Then take her, Digger.

537
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,277
The order said no personal effects.

538
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,794
Since when have you been
fussy about orders?

539
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,076
All right.

540
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,517
We'll be transferring you to your own craft
about 1800.

541
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,994
All right?

542
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,152
ANNOUNCEMENT:
Diving stations in five minutes time.

543
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,279
Diving stations in five minutes time.

544
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,471
Second coxswain and dinghy party,
muster in the control room.

545
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,640
Second coxswain and dinghy party,
muster in the control room.

546
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,793
- Sir...
- Yes, sir?

547
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,633
What do you reckon they'll give us
for supper - chicken again?

548
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,518
Don't you ever think of
anything except food?

549
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,238
Well, I look at it this way, sir.

550
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,038
Either we get what's coming to us

551
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,190
and then we won't be
bothered by food no more

552
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,236
or else we do the job,
blow Tirpitz sky high,

553
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,675
get nicked by Jerry
and put in a prisoner of war camp.

554
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,061
What's all this about prison camps?
12 hours

555
00:42:29,087 --> 00:42:31,336
after the attack you'll
be back in this sub.

556
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,550
Stuffing yourself with

557
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,870
I'll believe that when I do it, sir.

558
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,030
- You chaps ready?
CORBETT: Yes, sir.

559
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,076
Down periscope.

560
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,074
If we transfer crews now
while there's a bit of light,

561
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,357
- I can tow you in another four miles.
- Fair enough.

562
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,790
Tell X3 we're surfacing to transfer crews.

563
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,474
Tell X3 we are surfacing
to transfer crews, sir.

564
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,154
I have a feeling those chaps
are going to be glad to see us.

565
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,674
- Stand by to surface.
- Stand by to surface.

566
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,875
Diving stations.

567
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,713
- Stand by to surface. Report main vents.
- Report main vents.

568
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,473
Open one, two, three, four,
five and six LP master blowers.

569
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,437
Open one, two, three, four, ﬁve and six.

570
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,353
- Check all LP tank size.
- Check all LP tank size.

571
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,549
What's that funny smell, Dad?

572
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,835
- That's air, son.
- All right.

573
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,070
- All right, stand by to transfer.
- Aye aye, sir.

574
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,388
And about time too.

575
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,675
Give the ruddy Tirpitz an
extra kick from us, eh?

576
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,113
Don't worry. We will.

577
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,475
- Good luck.
- Bye.

578
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,834
Rather you than me.

579
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,398
They've transferred crews all right.

580
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,835
Stand by! There's a ruddy
drift mine caught in the tow.

581
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,109
Hey.

582
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,272
Hold on to your hats.
There's a mine caught in our tow.

583
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,039
My God.

584
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,680
It's a mine! It's fouled the tow rope.

585
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,068
There's a mine on the tow.
Shut all water-tight doors.

586
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,633
I never could stand loud bangs.

587
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,956
ABERCROMBIE: Right, move along, there.

588
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,392
It's all right. You can take out
your ear plugs. She's gone.

589
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,036
- Corbett and Duffy have
transferred crews, sir. - Good.

590
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,475
- Well, we'd better love you and leave you.
- Yes, sir.

591
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,278
- Ship's head?
- 1'05, sir.

592
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,635
- Periscope depth?
- 32 feet, sir.

593
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,676
Up periscope.

594
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,916
Well?

595
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,589
All clear.

596
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,238
Stand by to surface.

597
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,959
- Diving stations.
- Diving stations.

598
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,190
- Check main vents.
- Check main vents.

599
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,032
Signal X1 we're surfacing.

600
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,473
Signal X1 we're surfacing.

601
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,634
Well, thanks for the ride.

602
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,188
- Blow Tirpitz clean out of the water.
- We'll have a go.

603
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,475
We'll be waiting for the bang about dawn.

604
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,516
- Good luck, sir.
- Bye.

605
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,396
Alright, here we go.

606
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,316
- Dive, dive, dive.
- Dive, dive, dive, sir.

607
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,709
- 3O feet.
- 3O feet, sir.

608
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,631
- Full ahead, group down.
- Full ahead.

609
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,279
- Steer 135.
- ‘I35 it is, sir.

610
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,228
- Give me a course for Stjernsund.
- Aye aye, sir.

611
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,958
Trimmed for diving, sir.

612
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,359
Fine.

613
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,749
- Periscope depth?
- Ten feet.

614
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,512
Half ahead, group down.

615
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,556
Half ahead, group down, sir.

616
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,598
FRASER: Time?

617
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,910
- 2227.
- Not bad.

618
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,318
New course will be 128, sir.

619
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,358
FRASER. Steer 128.
- 128 it is, sir.

620
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,874
- Steady as she goes.
- Steady as she goes.

621
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,469
- Half ahead, group down.
- Half ahead, group down.

622
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,710
Depth.
Depth.

623
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,953
Periscope depth now, sir.

624
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,228
CORBETT.
Looks like shore ﬂights. Fine on port bow.

625
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,276
Any ideas, pilot?

626
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,120
(sighs)

627
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,112
Could be this island.
There's a fishing village there.

628
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,919
What do you mean, could be?
Could be Southend Pier.

629
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,956
Definitely not Southend, sir.

630
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,235
Well, boys, we're on our way.

631
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:52,677
Let's pop in quick, blow her sky high,
and home in time for bed, eh?

632
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,591
Talking.

633
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,596
- Course?
- Course 172, sir.

634
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,794
There's something on the starboard beam.

635
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,233
It's a tanker.

636
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,276
Take her down 40 feet. Flood Q.

637
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,316
Flooding.

638
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,076
Q flooded.

639
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,796
(Ship's engines)

640
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,116
40 feet, sir.

641
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,156
(Engines come closer)

642
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,116
(Engines fade)

643
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,669
The skipper of the big sub
will be biting his nails when he sees that.

644
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,716
Not allowed to torpedo!

645
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,552
Sounds like a big one, too.

646
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,029
Depth.
Depth,

647
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,916
Oh, for a nice torpedo.

648
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,754
Can't be keeping much of a watch
or they'd have seen us at that range.

649
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,876
The lookout's half asleep, I expect.

650
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,797
I can see the Brattholm Islands now.

651
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,836
Course?

652
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,273
182, sir.

653
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,918
Steer 176.

654
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,956
176, sir.

655
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,996
176 now, sir.

656
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,274
- Take her down to 3O feet.
- 3O feet, sir.

657
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,920
You're sure we're in the
right fjord, skipper?

658
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,956
I mean, this is dead easy.

659
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,996
You wait.

660
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,036
I said course 107.

661
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,076
Course is 107, sir.

662
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,116
It bloody well isn't, you know.

663
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,156
Brattholm's dead ahead.

664
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,996
Then gyro's off the board, then, sir.

665
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,036
Any idea what's wrong?

666
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,120
No.

667
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,118
I'd better go aft, switch her off
and open her up, sir.

668
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,156
Come on, quickly.

669
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,038
What's the depth here?

670
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,076
Five fathoms. Shingle and mud, sir.

671
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,628
Well, we'll have to sit
on the bottom and wait.

672
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,676
Take her down.

673
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,512
Gently!

674
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,556
Aye aye, sir.

675
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,596
Slow ahead, group down.

676
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,636
- 25 feet, sir.
- Right, stop motor.

677
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,676
Stop motor.

678
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,670
Seems like the chart was right for once.

679
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,076
(Grinding of metal)

680
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,396
Emergency lighting, Quick!

681
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,752
Stand by to surface.

682
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,592
Stand by to surface, sir.

683
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,636
Shut main vents.

684
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,199
Main vents shut, sir.

685
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,554
Ready to surface, sir.

686
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,359
Surface.

687
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,996
Any more tea?

688
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,073
Yes, sir.

689
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,956
Just 12 miles over there...

690
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,280
..Tirpitz.

691
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,037
Now you mention it,
I can almost smell the sauerkraut.

692
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,076
Recharge batteries now.

693
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,116
Aye aye, sir.

694
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,436
- Captain.
- All right, sir?

695
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,236
(Gargles)

696
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,078
Any movement?

697
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,116
CORBETT: I'm not sure.

698
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,156
Listen!

699
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,518
That's funny. It sounds like music.

700
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,549
(Music on radio)

701
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,596
(Speaks German)

702
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,596
Keep still!

703
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,636
Ersatz.

704
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,393
You stay on watch.

705
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,436
I'll get below and get a move on.

706
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,520
Right.

707
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,876
Well, how is it?

708
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,916
Still showing 296, sir.

709
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,956
We know that's wrong.

710
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,792
Couldn't we go in by periscope?

711
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,314
It's only about ten miles.
We could take it slow.

712
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,359
Supposing something goes wrong with it.
We can't sail entirely blind.

713
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,238
- If we surface, that'd give the game away.
- That's it.

714
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,074
On the other hand, we don't know
if the others have even got this far.

715
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,230
We'd look ruddy silly if we turned back

716
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:58,393
and found out we were the only ones
who had a chance of hitting (he Tirpitz.

717
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,398
All right, then, we'll attack.

718
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:09,837
It'll mean periscope depth all the way -
unless we get too close to a Jerry ship.

719
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,478
Let's take her up.

720
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,476
All right.

721
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,313
0300. We're going in.

722
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,274
- Dive, dive, dive.
- Dive, dive, dive, sir.

723
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,516
This is it.

724
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,558
- Dive, dive, dive. 3O feet.
- Dive, dive, dive. 3O feet.

725
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,636
Steer 220,

726
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,676
Steer 220, sir.

727
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,716
Steady on 220, sir.

728
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,876
- Let's help you into this.
- Sir.

729
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,756
30 feet now.

730
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,278
Periscope depth.

731
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,237
Periscope depth, sir.

732
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,276
Periscope depth now.

733
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,558
Net bouys dead ahead.

734
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,756
Small coaster. Red 45.

735
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,232
Stand by to flood W and D.

736
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,993
- Shut No.2 main vent.
- No. 2 main vent shut, sir.

737
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,718
- Shut No.2 Kingston.
- Shut, sir.

738
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,792
- Slow ahead, group down.
- Slow ahead, group down, sir.

739
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,232
(Whining)

740
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,710
- Slow, group down.
- Slow, group down, sir.

741
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,995
Small coaster dead ahead.

742
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,833
Well, I'm damned!
They're opening the boom for her.

743
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,876
Full ahead, group up!

744
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:47,794
If we can get through that gate,
it will save us hours of wire cutting.

745
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,916
I'll want 20 feet in a minute.

746
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,195
20 feet of lovely water waiting.

747
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,712
Any more urge?

748
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,472
Maximum now, sir.

749
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,475
Don't look now, they're closing the boom.

750
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,073
Quick off the mark, aren't they?

751
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,836
Here we go. Take her down 20 feet.

752
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,596
And hang on.

753
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,676
(Motor whines)

754
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,873
She's not answering, sir.

755
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,876
I've got no control here.

756
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,916
(Scraping grinding)

757
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,430
Blimey! We're through!

758
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,396
Do you know, I believe we are.

759
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,436
Periscope depth.

760
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,476
Periscope depth, sir.

761
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,391
Half ahead, group down.

762
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,436
Take her slowly.

763
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,073
- Open No.2 main vent.
- No. 2 main vent open, sir.

764
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,277
- Open No.2 Kingston.
- No. 2 Kingston open, sir.

765
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,112
Depth.
Depth.

766
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,873
- Are you all right?
- Give us a hand.

767
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,396
Nice work, diver. Have a good swim?

768
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,232
Place is lousy with jellyfish.

769
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,276
Periscope depth.

770
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,589
There she is, large as life.

771
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,636
Larger, in fact.

772
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,479
Ah, my beauts, if you
could see what I can see.

773
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,356
We're gonna get her, after all.

774
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,440
Huh?

775
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,115
Flood Q, full ahead, group up, crash dive!

776
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,873
- Full ahead, group up, crash dive.
- Pray, boys.

777
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,916
(Crashing and splintering)

778
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,153
Periscope gone, sir?

779
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,038
Lucky it wasn't us.

780
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,473
All right, blow Q.

781
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,710
Blow Q, sir. Q blowing, sir.

782
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,756
Bring her up slowly.

783
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,796
Periscope depth. Periscope depth.

784
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,836
Q blown, sir.

785
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,276
Periscope depth now.

786
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,672
Can't see a thing.

787
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,273
We're blind.

788
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,193
- No periscope, no compass.
- Too right we're blind!

789
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,280
What now?

790
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,754
Now we just sit on the bottom and wait.

791
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,398
It's all we can do.

792
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,118
We could bail out.

793
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,156
Not yet we couldn't.

794
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,915
We're so near Tirpitz, we'd only
give the game away for the others.

795
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,116
When we hear that bang, we'll bail out.

796
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,156
Not before.

797
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,196
Yes, sir.

798
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,876
Depth: ten fathoms.

799
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,109
Shingle.

800
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,156
Aye.

801
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,836
OK, slow ahead.

802
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,275
- Group down.
- Slow ahead, group down.

803
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,916
Take her down.

804
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,149
Slowly.

805
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,432
There she is.

806
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,670
It'll be anti-torpedo nets in a minute.

807
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,796
Stand by to dive.

808
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,711
Stand by to dive, sir.

809
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,756
It's hellish shallow about here, sir.

810
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:09,955
We'll have to risk that.

811
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,758
Any sign of activity?

812
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,796
Not a flicker.

813
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,395
They're all still dreaming
of their fat Frauleins back home.

814
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,596
- AT nets ahead. Take her down.
- Take her down.

815
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,148
- Half ahead, group down.
- Half ahead, group down.

816
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,796
(Metalic Grinding)

817
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,399
Hold it.

818
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,879
Hold it.

819
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,075
Right, hold her. Keep her like this.

820
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,276
We'll bump under her nets if it splits us.

821
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,118
Flood Q.

822
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,918
Don't let her surface.

823
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,876
(Shouts in German)

824
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,396
(Speaks German)

825
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,716
(German)

826
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,279
Depth charges.

827
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,873
Someones in trouble.

828
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,035
I hope they don't pop off our side cargoes.

829
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,910
You won't have to worry
about much if they do.

830
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,076
(Explosions

831
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,119
(Silence)

832
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:14,198
We're through.

833
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,878
And that means there's nothing between us
and that juicy great battle wagon.

834
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,913
Now for it.

835
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,916
Can't see a ruddy thing.

836
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,878
Wait a minute.

837
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,791
Yeah!

838
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,836
We've got her.

839
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,876
Slow, group down.

840
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,313
Slow, group down.

841
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,356
Gently. Gently, gently.

842
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,476
Only half an hour more, cobber.

843
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,120
We may have to wait a
little longer than that...

844
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,156
Only half an hour more, cobber.

845
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,156
Till we hear the bang, eh?

846
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,830
Yes, that's an idea. What about a tune?

847
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,876
Only wish I could.

848
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,916
Jerry‘d pick it up?

849
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,956
They might get a little suspicious

850
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:56,999
if they heard a dirty British song
coming up through their deck plates.

851
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,116
- Are we as near as that, then?
- Sure.

852
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,958
(Explosion)

853
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,393
That's it!

854
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,038
Depth charge.

855
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:11,999
Probably just a routine operation,
nothing to do with our boys at all.

856
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,310
Side cargo makes a bigger bang than that.

857
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,156
Full astern, group down.

858
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,916
Ship not moving astern.

859
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,956
Full ahead, group down. Trim up.

860
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,030
- Hard aport.
- Full ahead, group down, trim up!

861
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,076
Hard aport, sir.

862
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,636
Shut one main vent.

863
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,837
- Blow one main ballast.
- One main ballast blowing, sir.

864
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,356
One main ballast blown, sir.

865
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,396
No ruddy good.

866
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,436
Full astern, group up.

867
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,476
That's done it, sir.

868

(Machine-gun

869

871
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,238
She won't go down.

872
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,356
The net must have fouled the hydroplanes.

873
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:38,998
Flood Q, flood main ballast.

874
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,230

Well, let's get the hell
out of here, shall we?

886
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,871
It's no good, skipper.
She won't dance, sir.

887
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,599

888
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,079
40 feet.

889
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,037
She's on her side.

890
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,910
All right, then. We'll go on in as we are.

891

She's moving, isn't she?

897
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,675
She can't be. She's still on the bottom.

898
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:22,837
Seemed to me she... keeled over a bit.

01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,036
Nein, nein, nein. (Speaks German)

1045
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:06,429
They've only got to move it
a few feet to one side.

1046
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:08,476
- They don't know that.
- Yet.

1047
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,156
Let's stall it.

1048
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,594
- You, sir, command this party?
- No.

1049
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,476
Are you in charge of this party?

1050
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,798
- Excuse me?
- Are you commander of this party?

1051
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,316
Oh, yes... Yes, I am.

1052
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:34,274
We wish to know immediately what
kind of charge have you employed.

1053
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,316
I beg your pardon?

1054
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,478
We want to know what kind of explosives
you have used.

1055
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,396
Yes, I'm sure you do.

1056
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:47,477
You realise that you are in danger with us.

1057
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,953
- Do you realise that, Corbett?
- No, sir, I didn't.

1058
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,349
What's the time?

1059
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,635
- Ten minutes to, sir.
- Yes, we do.

1060
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,430
Now listen, all of you.

1061
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,310
You'll be sent to prison camp, in any case.

1062
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:06,597
If you tell us the nature and position
of your explosives,

1063
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,556
we can make things easier for you.

1064
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,350
Eight minutes to go, sir.

1065
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,994
They must move her. They're not crazy.

1066
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:30,038
Here. Do you think we could move along
the deck a bit?

1067
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:31,997
Not a chance. Why?

1068
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,469
I reckon we're plum on top of the charges,
that's all.

1069
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,950
- What's the matter? You tired of swimming?

01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,030
- Engines. Feel them?
- Yeah.

1075
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:03,836
Five minutes.

1076
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,716
They must get her moving.

1077
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:10,232
I wish to hell we had used limpets.

1078
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,275

Three minutes.

1081
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:04,876
She's moving.

1082
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:09,157
- No, she's not.
- Props are turning, anyway.

1083
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:17,516
Tight.

1089
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:07,436
Flood her up - number one. Open everything.

1090
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,476
Oh, what a lovely bang!

1091
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:18,670
That must have broken her back.

1092
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:22,196
- She won't move from here in this war.
- Hey, look. It's given me a nosebleed.

1093
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:26,114
- You think they heard that in
Whitehall, sir? - (Urgent shouting)

I hope he's got a smashing sense of humor.
