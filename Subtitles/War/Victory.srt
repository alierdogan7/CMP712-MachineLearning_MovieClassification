1
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:25,490
They're here.

2
00:05:25,638 --> 00:05:27,038
They're coming, sir.

3
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:34,824
Hand me those files on the death
of young Williams, will you, please?

4
00:05:58,631 --> 00:06:01,351
Colonel Waldron, you know Herr Rinder.

5
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:04,994
Herr Doktor from the Swiss Red Cross.

6
00:06:06,014 --> 00:06:08,014
Oberleutnant Strauss.

7
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:11,041
Major Von Steiner.

8
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:19,385
Colonel Waldron is
the senior British officer.

9
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:22,208
Major Rose,
head of the lntelligence Committee.

10
00:06:22,406 --> 00:06:24,886
Wing Commander Shurlock,
head of their Escape Committee.

11
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:26,276
Nicht wahr?

12
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:29,029
I think you've come to investigate
the killing of my officer.

13
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:30,485
An accident.

14
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:32,746
I would like the Red Cross
to see the whole camp.

15
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:35,197
Your sleeping quarters, mess, toilets.

16
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,301
And see that you are being treated well...

17
00:06:37,422 --> 00:06:40,382
...according to the spirit
of the Geneva Convention.

18
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:52,807
Come on.

19
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:19,905
Please, sir, can I have my ball back?

20
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:41,671
You are the Sportfuhrer?

21
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:43,949
I'm Colby.

22
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:45,699
Colby?

23
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:47,559
That's very familiar.

24
00:07:47,912 --> 00:07:49,312
It's a common name.

25
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,426
They're very enthusiastic.

26
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:56,283
No bloody good, but very enthusiastic.

27
00:07:57,088 --> 00:07:58,288
Do you play matches?

28
00:07:58,423 --> 00:08:00,863
Oh, yeah, we have a league.
Four divisions.

29
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:02,701
We even play internationals.

30
00:08:02,844 --> 00:08:03,884
Internationals?

31
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:04,771
Yeah.

32
00:08:04,888 --> 00:08:06,968
England, lreland, Scotland, Wales.

33
00:08:07,432 --> 00:08:08,872
You call that international?

34
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:11,977
It would be international
if you played against Germany.

35
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:13,587
We'd murder you.

36
00:08:14,773 --> 00:08:16,973
Colby! John Colby.

37
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,220
Yes. Westham United and England.

38
00:08:21,405 --> 00:08:22,645
That's right.

39
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:25,849
It's a shame the war
has ended your career.

40
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:27,487
Interrupted.

41
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:30,195
Let's hope so.

42
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:32,138
The colonel's protest will be
a waste of breath, I'm afraid.

43
00:09:32,563 --> 00:09:33,643
Two hearts.

44
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,580
If we don't kick up a stink, we give
the blighters permission to do it again.

45
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:38,817
No bid.

46
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,278
Pass.

47
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,380
Colby, what were you talking
to Jerry about?

48
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,760
None of your business.

49
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,150
Two spades.

50
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:48,979
It is our business.

51
00:09:49,206 --> 00:09:53,046
You were seen in conversation
with the enemy, a Major Von Steiner.

52
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:54,578
What did he want?

53
00:09:54,711 --> 00:09:56,071
He recognized me.

54
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:57,495
As what? Pass.

55
00:09:58,048 --> 00:09:58,888
Pass.

56
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,766
So the major's a football fan, huh?

57
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:02,766
Elementary, my dear Shurlock.

58
00:10:03,012 --> 00:10:05,652
Karl von Steiner played
for Germany in 1938.

59
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:07,583
What did he say to you?

60
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:08,805
Buzz off.

61
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:10,494
-In German?
-Yeah.

62
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,771
I think I'm getting something.

63
00:10:13,397 --> 00:10:15,677
...working to extremes
to divert world attention...

64
00:10:15,858 --> 00:10:17,698
...from their losses in North Africa...

65
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:21,859
...and the reported inhumane treatment of
the prisoners from East European nations.

66
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:30,297
Over here, over here.

67
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,140
What's the verdict on Williams?

68
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,660
Regrettable mistake.

69
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:50,921
The whole bloody war's
a regrettable mistake.

70
00:10:51,104 --> 00:10:52,064
I agree.

71
00:10:52,188 --> 00:10:53,148
Do you?

72
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:57,169
You can believe me or not,
it's nothing to me.

73
00:10:58,194 --> 00:11:00,914
If nations could settle their differences
on the football pitch...

74
00:11:01,114 --> 00:11:03,074
...wouldn't that be a challenge?

75
00:11:03,992 --> 00:11:05,632
How would you like...

76
00:11:05,786 --> 00:11:08,666
...to play a game against a team
from the Wehrmacht?

77
00:11:09,665 --> 00:11:11,825
A team from the army base nearby?

78
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:14,801
What for? To settle the war?

79
00:11:15,337 --> 00:11:16,737
Unfortunately not.

80
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:18,891
Let's say, for morale.

81
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:20,793
Yours or ours?

82
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:22,587
For both.

83
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:25,205
Life in this place must be very boring.

84
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:32,393
What sort of team? They any good?

85
00:11:32,522 --> 00:11:35,122
I haven't chosen a team. It's just an idea.

86
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:37,997
It's not an order. You can't make us play.

87
00:11:38,153 --> 00:11:39,713
No, it's a challenge.

88
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:44,189
No.

89
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:46,653
It'd be a washout. A complete washout.

90
00:11:46,828 --> 00:11:48,028
Why?

91
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:50,149
Look at them.

92
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:52,609
Look at them. They're bloody useless.

93
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:56,379
I mean, look at those clothes,
and those bloody great boots.

94
00:11:56,589 --> 00:11:59,509
They're charging about there
like a herd of elephants.

95
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:02,117
Play football? They can hardly stand up.

96
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,240
Boots can be supplied.

97
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:08,601
You mean, proper gear?
Shirts and shorts?

98
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:11,922
No.

99
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:15,278
They couldn't run about for 90 minutes.

100
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,560
They'd be chuckin' their guts out.

101
00:12:17,986 --> 00:12:19,786
All right, I'm sorry.

102
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:22,366
Major....

103
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,184
I'd want...

104
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,976
...special conditions, special rations.

105
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:33,422
The team would have to live together,
eat together....

106
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,342
I'd want meat...

107
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,002
...fresh vegetables, eggs...

108
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,178
...beer.

109
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,347
You talk to your colonel?

110
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,441
No matter what he says,
if you could supply us with all that stuff...

111
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,226
...you'll have a game of football.

112
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,643
Which reminds me...

113
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,497
...if it's confined to officers...

114
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,369
...I'm not bloody playing.

115
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,298
I want a decent team. I want the lads...

116
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,014
...from over there.

117
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:03,699
Okay?

118
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,572
We shall see.

119
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:07,947
All right.

120
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,576
Just a minute.

121
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,396
Right. Escapes.

122
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:20,671
We've had all the usual requests...

123
00:13:20,802 --> 00:13:23,042
...but here's a new one you might like.

124
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:26,981
Peter Bailey has a plan to pole-vault
the south fence.

125
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:30,183
God, what will they think of next?

126
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:32,285
Oh, Christ, refused.

127
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:34,515
Anything else?

128
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:36,569
No. Let's have Hatch in.

129
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:39,403
Hatch.

130
00:13:41,448 --> 00:13:42,768
Sorry to keep you waiting.

131
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:44,306
You're an American?

132
00:13:44,451 --> 00:13:47,091
Enlisted Canadian Army '38,
transferred commandos.

133
00:13:47,288 --> 00:13:48,608
How long have you been with us?

134
00:13:48,706 --> 00:13:49,906
Since Dieppe.

135
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,193
How many attempts?

136
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,519
Two on the way, three since then.
Time before last, I got as far as Stuttgart.

137
00:13:56,756 --> 00:13:58,196
How's this one going?

138
00:13:58,341 --> 00:14:00,101
Well, sir, the whole thing
depends on the fact that...

139
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:03,498
...some of the goons don't patrol
when we're havin' a shower.

140
00:14:03,805 --> 00:14:04,925
Some of them?

141
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,900
Yes. Like Hans and Anton.

142
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:09,898
At least one of them should be outside
walking back and forth...

143
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:12,421
...but they know we're inside
havin' a shower.

144
00:14:12,564 --> 00:14:16,404
They come inside, lean against the door,
have a smoke if they can bum one.

145
00:14:16,652 --> 00:14:19,092
I think if somebody went missing,
they wouldn't report it.

146
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,679
-Why not?
-They wouldn't be sure.

147
00:14:20,823 --> 00:14:23,423
They'd think they'd miscounted
and leave it until roll call.

148
00:14:23,617 --> 00:14:26,577
And if you could cover for me at roll call,
I could be gone for days.

149
00:14:26,787 --> 00:14:27,987
Wait a minute.

150
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:31,339
You're going too fast for me. How are you
gonna get out of the wash house?

151
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:34,342
There is a vent in the shower room.
It leads into a storeroom or something.

152
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:35,625
Yes, I know.

153
00:14:35,838 --> 00:14:38,758
It must have been built as a lavatory
to match the one on the German side.

154
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:41,047
If I can get in there,
with something to pick the lock--

155
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:43,299
And you'd be back in the enclosure
where you started.

156
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:45,911
But I'd be all alone. There's no one there.

157
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:47,619
And I could get onto the roof...

158
00:14:47,768 --> 00:14:51,328
...go underneath the barbed wire
and drop into the German compound.

159
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:53,729
Naked?

160
00:14:55,609 --> 00:14:59,009
How are you planning to get out
of the German compound naked?

161
00:14:59,863 --> 00:15:01,663
I've got five or six ideas.

162
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:05,179
Shall we discuss them?

163
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:06,711
Yes.

164
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:17,678
Colby insisted on playing the other ranks
against the best of the officers.

165
00:15:18,007 --> 00:15:19,807
What's the idea behind that?

166
00:15:19,926 --> 00:15:22,926
I suppose he wants to pick
the best team possible.

167
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:26,906
I don't think he's quite got the point,
has he?

168
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:30,463
Tell him to come and see me, will you?

169
00:15:31,021 --> 00:15:33,581
Cover him, Tony. Let's go.

170
00:15:35,192 --> 00:15:37,752
Good goal. Well done, sir.

171
00:15:38,195 --> 00:15:40,035
-What's your name?
-Sid Harmer.

172
00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:42,649
How'd you like double rations
for a month or so, Sid?

173
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:44,543
Whose mother
do you want me to strangle?

174
00:15:44,702 --> 00:15:45,942
Welcome aboard.

175
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,239
Okay, I'm ready to sign up.

176
00:15:49,624 --> 00:15:50,904
Sign off, Hatch.

177
00:15:53,878 --> 00:15:55,838
Give 'em the ball. Stop it.

178
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,216
Come on.

179
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:00,754
Tackle it.

180
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:02,595
Nice try.

181
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:05,361
Thanks, Colby.
It's not quite like playing for Manchester...

182
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:07,035
...but it's better than not playing at all.

183
00:16:07,184 --> 00:16:08,544
Welcome aboard.

184
00:16:08,894 --> 00:16:09,774
What about me?

185
00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:10,855
Get out there.

186
00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:11,819
What about me?

187
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:13,579
Get out there and play.

188
00:16:18,112 --> 00:16:21,672
The map of Marburg is from an old
guidebook, but it's reliable, I should hope.

189
00:16:21,908 --> 00:16:24,948
There's a fast train to Cologne
at 5:33 every Saturday.

190
00:16:25,203 --> 00:16:28,403
Now, under the map you'll see
they've done a sketch of the stadium...

191
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:31,583
...the exits, perspectives,
and changing rooms.

192
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:32,913
Colonel...

193
00:16:33,753 --> 00:16:34,913
...what are you talking about?

194
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:37,445
I'm talking about your escape, Colby.

195
00:16:43,138 --> 00:16:44,178
My escape?

196
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:48,401
Yes, of course.
The whole team if possible.

197
00:16:48,644 --> 00:16:50,644
What about the lorry
that's taking you to the match?

198
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:52,813
You could loosen the floorboards
on the way in and...

199
00:16:52,982 --> 00:16:53,822
...drop out on the way back.

200
00:16:53,941 --> 00:16:56,741
You stick to scrounging, Pyrie,
and I'll stick to football.

201
00:16:56,902 --> 00:16:59,662
It's your duty, Colby, as an officer.

202
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:01,544
It could be an excellent opportunity.

203
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:03,459
It's certainly worth considering, old boy.

204
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:05,576
I am not interested in getting them killed.

205
00:17:05,745 --> 00:17:07,345
Are you afraid to try?

206
00:17:07,705 --> 00:17:10,545
Your escaping is
just some bloody upper-crust game.

207
00:17:13,044 --> 00:17:16,044
They've done their job
and want to be left alone till it's over.

208
00:17:16,214 --> 00:17:18,214
Now, that will be all, Colby.

209
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,959
Thank you.

210
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:49,219
Come on, Hatch.

211
00:18:50,021 --> 00:18:52,021
-Good tackle, Terry.
-Come on, Terry.

212
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,110
Go.

213
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:55,956
Did you see that?
Am I good, or am I good?

214
00:18:56,653 --> 00:18:58,533
-What's your name?
-You know my name.

215
00:18:58,655 --> 00:19:01,015
-What's your name?
-Terry. Terry Brady.

216
00:19:02,033 --> 00:19:04,433
How'd you like to come and live
with the officers?

217
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:06,259
Only if you've got a chaperone, mate.

218
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:07,773
Welcome aboard, Terry.

219
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,620
Where'd you learn to do that?

220
00:19:35,735 --> 00:19:37,495
When I was a boy...

221
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,890
...in Trinidad...

222
00:19:41,616 --> 00:19:43,896
...on the streets, with the oranges.

223
00:19:46,955 --> 00:19:49,635
How'd you like to play football
against the Germans?

224
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,073
Why not?

225
00:19:54,046 --> 00:19:55,486
Unload him, Tony.

226
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:02,413
Hey, foul there.

227
00:20:02,555 --> 00:20:05,435
Stupid, bloody Yank!
What the hell do you think this is?

228
00:20:05,641 --> 00:20:07,601
-Bloody hell!
-Well, what'd I do?

229
00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:09,009
You know bloody well.

230
00:20:09,103 --> 00:20:10,143
No, you tell me. What'd I do?

231
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:13,351
You can't tackle like that in soccer.
I've told you that for a year!

232
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:15,126
I was just goin' for the ball.

233
00:20:15,276 --> 00:20:18,116
You use that bloody American style
again here, and you'll be barred.

234
00:20:18,321 --> 00:20:19,721
You play English, I play American.

235
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:22,585
We don't play the bloody American game.
Get off.

236
00:20:23,493 --> 00:20:26,373
Hey, what kind of game is this?
For old ladies and fairies?

237
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,660
I quit.

238
00:20:28,415 --> 00:20:29,415
Okay.

239
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:32,979
One, two, three...

240
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:37,961
...four, five, six, seven...

241
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,100
...eight, nine, turn.

242
00:20:43,014 --> 00:20:45,134
One, two...

243
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:49,151
...three, four, five--

244
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:52,439
Hatch, the committee
has considered your plan.

245
00:20:52,774 --> 00:20:54,934
You may see the tailor and the forger.

246
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,270
And the locksmith.
I've got to see the locksmith.

247
00:20:57,446 --> 00:20:59,686
Yes, but see the tailor first.
That takes time.

248
00:20:59,865 --> 00:21:03,425
...seven, eight, nine, turn.

249
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:05,827
Thanks.

250
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:11,911
Hey, Colby.

251
00:21:12,795 --> 00:21:14,795
Colby, I've been looking for you.

252
00:21:15,297 --> 00:21:17,537
You know that football team of yours?

253
00:21:17,842 --> 00:21:20,722
Know what you can do with that team?
Know where you can put it?

254
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:22,808
'Cause I don't want to be on that team.

255
00:21:22,972 --> 00:21:26,932
As a matter of fact, you couldn't pay me
to be on that football team, Colby.

256
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:29,261
You got it, Colby?

257
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:32,356
I don't need you
or your football team anymore.

258
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,938
You got it?
I don't need this aggravation, Colby.

259
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:48,628
Captain Colby. How are you?

260
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:51,277
Sit down, please.

261
00:21:59,677 --> 00:22:02,237
Why don't you tell me
what this is all about?

262
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:06,319
Our football match has been taken
a little out of our hands.

263
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:09,546
It has been decided...

264
00:22:09,688 --> 00:22:11,848
...that a German national team will play...

265
00:22:12,023 --> 00:22:15,823
...a combined team from the prisoners
of war of the occupied territories...

266
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:19,869
...August 15th,
at Colombes Stadium in Paris.

267
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:22,033
Paris?

268
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,984
That's crazy.

269
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:28,107
Come in, Muller.

270
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,588
This is Hauptmann Rainer Muller.

271
00:22:31,085 --> 00:22:32,565
Coach for our national team.

272
00:22:32,712 --> 00:22:34,112
Captain John Colby.

273
00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:36,378
We've met.

274
00:22:37,508 --> 00:22:38,948
A long time ago.

275
00:22:39,302 --> 00:22:40,942
Yeah. In London.

276
00:22:41,805 --> 00:22:43,245
You were center-half.

277
00:22:45,392 --> 00:22:47,912
Hauptmann Muller will assist me
and manage our team.

278
00:22:48,103 --> 00:22:50,343
Make sure you have everything you need.

279
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:52,189
Paris.

280
00:22:53,317 --> 00:22:54,837
What if I refuse?

281
00:23:00,824 --> 00:23:03,424
I think you will recognize
some of those names.

282
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:18,667
No, thank you.

283
00:23:20,762 --> 00:23:21,682
Yeah.

284
00:23:23,223 --> 00:23:25,423
There are some good players on here.

285
00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:27,743
British, French.

286
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:29,767
Dutch.

287
00:23:30,939 --> 00:23:32,379
Even a Norwegian.

288
00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:37,567
What about the Poles and the Czechs?

289
00:23:37,738 --> 00:23:40,498
I mean, off the top of my head
I could think of...

290
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,870
...half a dozen East European players
who would have to be on that squad.

291
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,376
Isn't that so, Muller?

292
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:51,619
I'm sorry. I cannot let you have
any Eastern Europeans.

293
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:52,961
Why not?

294
00:23:53,338 --> 00:23:54,338
It's impossible.

295
00:23:54,464 --> 00:23:56,344
Officially, they do not exist.

296
00:23:56,466 --> 00:23:59,106
Germany does not recognize them
as prisoners of war.

297
00:23:59,302 --> 00:24:00,782
They're in labor camps.

298
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:04,169
Well, maybe not officially,
but they do exist as players...

299
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:07,094
...don't they?

300
00:24:07,394 --> 00:24:11,074
I don't know whether these
East European players are alive or dead...

301
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:14,196
...but you can find that out.

302
00:24:16,028 --> 00:24:17,988
As an officer and a gentleman...

303
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:21,315
...you are obliged to give me
a marginal chance of winning.

304
00:24:32,128 --> 00:24:33,808
Make your list, Captain.

305
00:24:34,631 --> 00:24:36,191
I'll see what I can do.

306
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,079
Collaboration pays.

307
00:24:49,772 --> 00:24:51,452
I don't consider it collaboration.

308
00:24:51,565 --> 00:24:54,645
And you are to be exhibited in Paris
like performing fleas?

309
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,534
I don't think London is going
to take very kindly to this, you know.

310
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:00,258
You've informed London?

311
00:25:00,408 --> 00:25:01,808
There's no need.

312
00:25:02,326 --> 00:25:05,366
The German propaganda machine
will take care of that.

313
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,660
Get that, Hatch.

314
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:17,115
Oh, a customer, good.

315
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:20,071
-Captain Lawry, how are you?
-I'm very well, very well.

316
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,460
If you'll just get dressed.

317
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:24,519
That's it. Over there.

318
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:28,498
Will you be so kind as to stand guard
while I deal with our American friend?

319
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:29,209
Okay.

320
00:25:29,313 --> 00:25:31,993
Stay where you are, Billy. Just listen.

321
00:25:40,241 --> 00:25:41,321
Here we are.

322
00:25:45,622 --> 00:25:47,542
Have you shaved?

323
00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:48,909
Good enough?

324
00:25:49,084 --> 00:25:50,364
Very good.

325
00:25:51,503 --> 00:25:53,823
You know, it's really very gratifying.

326
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:57,049
I'm surprised at
the relatively good conditions here.

327
00:25:57,301 --> 00:25:59,021
Compared to other camps, that is.

328
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:01,096
Everyone still wants to escape.

329
00:26:11,357 --> 00:26:12,917
Getting dressed? Good.

330
00:26:13,317 --> 00:26:15,037
Don't want to dilly-dally.

331
00:26:19,365 --> 00:26:23,125
Now, I can't promise you
a studio portrait, but it'll do.

332
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,910
You didn't make the lens as well,
did you?

333
00:26:29,084 --> 00:26:31,964
No. I'm a genius, not a magician.

334
00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:33,629
Sit down.

335
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:37,853
All right, now, don't smile.

336
00:26:38,051 --> 00:26:41,971
We want that criminal look
associated with passport photographs.

337
00:26:43,265 --> 00:26:46,505
Solemn, depressed--
The jacket's up. That's lovely.

338
00:26:46,811 --> 00:26:48,011
Now, hold that.

339
00:26:49,939 --> 00:26:51,139
Wait. One more for luck?

340
00:26:51,274 --> 00:26:53,194
No. Film's too valuable. Sorry.

341
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,399
This'll do.

342
00:27:00,158 --> 00:27:01,438
Now, here we are.

343
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:06,170
Now, Dupin's the name you want, is it?

344
00:27:06,498 --> 00:27:09,218
Yeah. Marcel Dupin, electrician.

345
00:27:09,668 --> 00:27:13,468
I need an address in Lyon and papers
to show I'm a conscripted worker.

346
00:27:13,714 --> 00:27:16,794
Yes. Why does Monsieur Dupin
want to go home?

347
00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:21,044
Compassionate leave, death in the family.

348
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,460
-Can you do it?
-Yes, it's quite simple.

349
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,641
Quite simple. Might even manage
a letter on your bereavement.

350
00:27:26,852 --> 00:27:27,852
Let's see.

351
00:27:28,187 --> 00:27:29,587
What have we got?

352
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,083
French police...

353
00:27:32,775 --> 00:27:35,895
...enter Germany, health officer,
military district....

354
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,512
They keep changing.
That's very inconsiderate of them.

355
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,498
Very.

356
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,094
How long will it take?

357
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,936
Well, you must realize, it's my busy time.

358
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,040
Everybody wants to escape
in the good weather.

359
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,126
Just be patient.

360
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:49,342
All right?

361
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,258
Be patient. Yeah. Thanks.

362
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:16,548
What the hell's that?

363
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:18,952
Who the hell are those guys?

364
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:27,318
I've had it. Look.
They've switched the guards on me.

365
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:30,259
Those goons are patrolling
like they're supposed to.

366
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,139
-Yes, I know.
-What do you mean, you know?

367
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:33,094
I know.

368
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:36,253
Hans and Anton have been switched
to watch over the football team.

369
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:38,185
Colby's football team?

370
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:41,809
They're my guards. I needed them.
A couple weeks, I was out of here.

371
00:28:41,973 --> 00:28:44,453
That's bad luck.
Just between ourselves, Hatch...

372
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,400
...l never thought it was
a very good plan, anyway.

373
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:01,570
Here we are.

374
00:29:02,327 --> 00:29:04,447
Luis, this is Arthur.

375
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:06,386
-Hello, Arthur.
-Sid and Terry.

376
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,820
Luis Fernandez.

377
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:08,678
Terry.

378
00:29:08,792 --> 00:29:10,192
Here's your beds over here.

379
00:29:10,294 --> 00:29:11,694
I'll have the top one.

380
00:29:11,795 --> 00:29:13,555
Help yourself. First come, first served.

381
00:29:13,714 --> 00:29:15,234
I'll take the bottom one.

382
00:29:15,383 --> 00:29:16,743
Okay, just leave me one.

383
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:19,082
-Not bad, is it?
-It's like the Savoy Hotel.

384
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:20,502
How would you know?

385
00:29:20,638 --> 00:29:22,678
There are no bleeding chambermaids.

386
00:29:23,975 --> 00:29:24,815
This one?

387
00:29:24,934 --> 00:29:25,894
Hi, guys.

388
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:35,595
-What do you think you're doing?
-I decided to join the team.

389
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:37,679
Tell me everything.

390
00:29:38,991 --> 00:29:42,191
Being on this team
is a one-way ticket out of here, right?

391
00:29:44,997 --> 00:29:46,157
You're not on this team.

392
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,690
Oh, yeah, sure I am.

393
00:29:48,626 --> 00:29:50,186
-I'm the trainer.
-The what?

394
00:29:50,336 --> 00:29:51,416
The trainer.

395
00:29:51,587 --> 00:29:55,747
Colby, you forgot to put in for a trainer.
Maybe I can't play your kind of football...

396
00:29:56,008 --> 00:29:59,528
...but in my kind, you know everything
there is to know about bruises, sprains....

397
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:01,882
So if you'll just get on
to your Von Steiner...

398
00:30:02,015 --> 00:30:05,975
...to get me some bandages,
some lineaments, some oils, some tapes...

399
00:30:06,227 --> 00:30:07,707
...we're in business.

400
00:30:10,982 --> 00:30:12,662
I don't want a trainer.

401
00:30:14,194 --> 00:30:16,474
Colby, I'm a ballplayer.

402
00:30:16,697 --> 00:30:18,897
I don't want to be left out
of somethin' like this.

403
00:30:19,032 --> 00:30:20,672
Pull the other one.

404
00:30:23,203 --> 00:30:24,963
I just want to be around the guys.

405
00:30:25,122 --> 00:30:26,242
Bullshit!

406
00:30:42,557 --> 00:30:43,597
Don't do this to me.

407
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:45,285
-I don't need a con man.
-Easy, Colby.

408
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:47,993
-You and your team wrecked my escape.
-How?

409
00:30:50,273 --> 00:30:52,273
I was ready. I was waiting for my papers.

410
00:30:52,401 --> 00:30:56,161
I was going through the wash house,
but only if those two goons were on duty.

411
00:30:56,405 --> 00:30:58,925
Now those two goons
have been transferred to you.

412
00:30:59,116 --> 00:31:01,756
So the only way out of here
is by bein' on that team.

413
00:31:01,911 --> 00:31:02,871
No.

414
00:31:04,288 --> 00:31:05,048
Why not?

415
00:31:05,122 --> 00:31:07,162
I won't be responsible for your death.

416
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,053
You'll get yourself shot.

417
00:31:13,423 --> 00:31:15,183
That's my choice, isn't it?

418
00:31:21,681 --> 00:31:23,321
So what is it, "yes" or "no"?

419
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:27,521
Okay.

420
00:31:59,638 --> 00:32:00,638
Tony.

421
00:32:01,598 --> 00:32:03,318
-Nice to see you.
-Great to see you. How are you?

422
00:32:03,475 --> 00:32:05,515
-Hello. Hatch, the trainer.
-Hi.

423
00:32:05,685 --> 00:32:07,165
-Doug Clure?
-Yeah.

424
00:32:07,312 --> 00:32:08,872
-What's going on?
-I'll tell you in a minute.

425
00:32:09,022 --> 00:32:10,222
-Hatch, the trainer, hi.
-Remy, Jean-Paul.

426
00:32:10,357 --> 00:32:11,677
Colby's mine.

427
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:13,262
Michel Filieu.

428
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,800
Hatch, the trainer.
Welcome to my holiday camp.

429
00:32:15,988 --> 00:32:17,748
Hello. How are you? Hello.

430
00:32:17,907 --> 00:32:19,387
-Erik Borg, right?
-Yes.

431
00:32:19,492 --> 00:32:20,292
Colby.

432
00:32:20,368 --> 00:32:22,048
-Hatch, the trainer.
-Hello.

433
00:32:22,161 --> 00:32:24,801
-Hello. How are you?
-I am Pieter Van Beck.

434
00:32:25,665 --> 00:32:26,585
Come inside.

435
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:27,746
Hatch, the trainer.

436
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:30,395
We'll have something to eat,
and I'll explain.

437
00:32:31,254 --> 00:32:33,454
The extra food is part of the deal.

438
00:32:33,923 --> 00:32:36,603
We still respond to roll call
three times a day...

439
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,530
...but apart from that,
we make our own rules.

440
00:32:40,764 --> 00:32:43,644
There is no rank here.
This is a football team.

441
00:32:44,226 --> 00:32:46,306
I am the captain and the manager.

442
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:48,551
Any questions?

443
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:52,449
I don't know how you did it...

444
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,840
...but cheers anyway.

445
00:32:55,988 --> 00:32:57,308
It's been a long time...

446
00:32:57,448 --> 00:32:59,848
...and none of us feels like or...

447
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:02,126
...looks like world-class players.

448
00:33:03,996 --> 00:33:06,356
It'll be tough getting into shape
with those boots...

449
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:09,821
...so let's hope the German major
gives us the proper gear.

450
00:33:13,048 --> 00:33:16,408
We gotta start somewhere,
so let's start with basics, shall we?

451
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,760
Slow, easy, stretching it fully. Okay?

452
00:33:20,722 --> 00:33:22,762
We won't be needing that for a while.

453
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:26,779
Come on, put 'em down.
Let's go. Pick 'em up.

454
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,460
Left, left.

455
00:33:28,605 --> 00:33:30,045
Left, right. Left, right.

456
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,830
Pick 'em up. Pick 'em up.
Put 'em down. Good.

457
00:33:33,235 --> 00:33:35,235
Good. Good. Good.

458
00:33:36,072 --> 00:33:39,352
Good, Colby. Come on, guys.
Pick 'em up, put 'em down.

459
00:33:39,575 --> 00:33:40,535
Good.

460
00:33:41,077 --> 00:33:43,397
They're all different sizes,
so make sure everything fits.

461
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:44,579
Everything fits.

462
00:33:44,706 --> 00:33:47,866
And I want you all to know
that if you're havin' any trouble with, say...

463
00:33:48,084 --> 00:33:51,124
...appendicitis, heart attacks....
That's okay. There's no problem.

464
00:33:51,338 --> 00:33:52,738
I can handle that. But listen...

465
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:54,881
...l don't want any blisters.

466
00:33:55,091 --> 00:33:57,331
No blisters allowed.

467
00:33:57,511 --> 00:34:00,471
So if there's anything wrong
with any of you guys, tell me now...

468
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:01,761
...not later, okay.

469
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,890
Minor inconveniences,
say like anal bleeding, tuberculosis...

470
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,230
...growing tumors, little inconveniences
like that. All right?

471
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,640
Shut up, Hatch.

472
00:34:10,775 --> 00:34:13,495
I'm just trying to get some team spirit
going here. Right guys?

473
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:14,733
Yeah, right.

474
00:34:15,071 --> 00:34:16,231
Make sure everything fits.

475
00:34:16,364 --> 00:34:18,764
Yeah, everything fits. Everything fits.

476
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:21,287
I'll keep this myself.

477
00:34:46,103 --> 00:34:48,583
Take no notice, lads. They're only jealous.

478
00:34:49,482 --> 00:34:50,762
Up your's.

479
00:36:30,963 --> 00:36:33,883
If you can get up here,
don't try and run through.

480
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,371
Don't try and be a hero
and get a goal yourself.

481
00:36:36,552 --> 00:36:40,672
That center...l want up there,
and I want you to pass. Always pass.

482
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:44,065
Let the ball do the running for you.
Don't try and run with it.

483
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:46,988
You're in no condition to run
for 90 minutes, I tell you.

484
00:36:47,146 --> 00:36:48,546
This especially applies to wingers.

485
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:52,090
If you can't cross, don't run it through.
Try and get a corner.

486
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,400
A set piece works in our favor.

487
00:36:54,904 --> 00:36:56,224
Which means that, as they--

488
00:36:56,364 --> 00:36:57,644
Give me this.

489
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:01,302
Colby, after givin' me ball here,
I do this...

490
00:37:04,873 --> 00:37:07,313
...this, this, goal.

491
00:37:07,876 --> 00:37:08,516
Easy.

492
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:12,102
That's the right spirit, Luis.

493
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:15,018
Keep it up. Before you know it,
you'll have me thinking it's easy.

494
00:37:15,259 --> 00:37:18,099
Colby, old chap,
Waldron would like a word.

495
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,119
I'll be right back, lads.

496
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:36,711
How did they get here?

497
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:39,885
I insisted on having them.

498
00:37:40,661 --> 00:37:41,861
You insisted?

499
00:37:43,705 --> 00:37:45,425
They're all great players.

500
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:48,199
They were.

501
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:53,238
You are a naive fool, Colby.

502
00:37:53,758 --> 00:37:55,558
Insisting on great players.

503
00:37:55,968 --> 00:38:00,568
Von Steiner has sent you five skeletons,
guarantees that you'll turn up in Paris...

504
00:38:01,015 --> 00:38:02,735
...for his propaganda victory.

505
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:05,290
The Germans are doing their job very well.

506
00:38:05,603 --> 00:38:06,763
London knows.

507
00:38:06,896 --> 00:38:08,096
We heard it on the news.

508
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:09,749
It's in all the papers.

509
00:38:10,191 --> 00:38:12,391
They're calling it another German lie.

510
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:16,007
London is saying that no British officer
would ever be involved in such a game.

511
00:38:16,198 --> 00:38:17,998
London is saying, Colonel?

512
00:38:18,951 --> 00:38:21,311
What about those poor bastards there?

513
00:38:23,038 --> 00:38:25,398
Do we send them back
to the labor camps?

514
00:38:25,874 --> 00:38:27,914
That's a very good question, Colby.

515
00:38:35,426 --> 00:38:37,306
They can't go in there like that.

516
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,870
Full of lice.

517
00:38:39,222 --> 00:38:41,502
Should take 'em around back, scrub 'em...

518
00:38:41,683 --> 00:38:44,083
...take off what they're wearin' and burn it.

519
00:38:44,227 --> 00:38:45,867
You guys want to get some water?

520
00:38:46,021 --> 00:38:47,141
Anybody got any soap?

521
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,270
Yeah, I have. I've got DDT, as well.

522
00:38:49,441 --> 00:38:50,561
All right.

523
00:38:50,984 --> 00:38:52,904
Come on, guys. Get some water.

524
00:39:47,376 --> 00:39:49,536
I'm responsible for them being here.

525
00:39:50,963 --> 00:39:54,883
And I'm responsible for them
being sent back, if we don't play.

526
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:01,586
I can't do that.

527
00:40:04,311 --> 00:40:07,951
But I can't tell any of you
to disobey his high command.

528
00:40:09,983 --> 00:40:12,703
So each of you will have to make
his own decision.

529
00:40:13,654 --> 00:40:14,894
We play.

530
00:40:15,823 --> 00:40:17,303
What else can we do?

531
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:21,065
Yes, we play.

532
00:40:21,996 --> 00:40:22,836
Yeah?

533
00:40:24,332 --> 00:40:26,612
-Everybody?
-Yeah, come on, let's play.

534
00:40:27,043 --> 00:40:28,243
Of course, we'll play.

535
00:40:30,004 --> 00:40:32,164
Come on. Looking good.

536
00:40:33,675 --> 00:40:36,795
You got a good bunch out there.
These guys are comin' along real fine.

537
00:40:37,012 --> 00:40:39,452
I think the Germans are gonna have to
go some to beat them.

538
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,999
-You're an optimist.
-Well, what are you?

539
00:40:44,978 --> 00:40:46,378
That's not bad, Hatch.

540
00:40:46,521 --> 00:40:47,881
What's not bad?

541
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,270
Using your hands.

542
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:51,319
You've got feet, I've got hands.

543
00:40:52,611 --> 00:40:53,771
Gimme that.

544
00:40:56,282 --> 00:40:58,122
-Get in there.
-Sure thing, General.

545
00:40:58,284 --> 00:40:59,244
Luis.

546
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:01,119
Luis....

547
00:41:01,704 --> 00:41:03,344
Fire a few at him.

548
00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:06,412
You've got to do better than that.

549
00:41:06,709 --> 00:41:08,109
Come on, you guys. Let's fire 'em in here.

550
00:41:08,211 --> 00:41:09,891
There we go. Here we go. Come on.

551
00:41:10,046 --> 00:41:11,446
Yeah, here we go. Put it in here.

552
00:41:11,548 --> 00:41:12,748
Give me some balls, Charley.

553
00:41:12,882 --> 00:41:14,922
You're gonna get serious now, huh?

554
00:41:15,051 --> 00:41:17,971
Okay, guys, come on, fire 'em in here.
Fire 'em in here. Let's go. All right?

555
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,460
Let's go. Come on. Don't be afraid of me.

556
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:22,599
Yeah. What, what's that?

557
00:41:23,644 --> 00:41:25,204
Right down the middle.

558
00:41:25,354 --> 00:41:27,434
Can you do it with your mouth shut?

559
00:41:28,065 --> 00:41:30,505
The mouth and the hands
work together as a team.

560
00:41:30,693 --> 00:41:31,933
Come on, come on.

561
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:33,749
Get your body behind it.

562
00:41:33,904 --> 00:41:37,264
Not like that, like that.
Hands behind it, pull it into the chest.

563
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:38,811
I'm aware of that.

564
00:41:40,077 --> 00:41:41,877
Come on, Hatch. I want to see it now.

565
00:41:42,038 --> 00:41:44,118
Come on, right there in the middle.

566
00:41:46,584 --> 00:41:48,224
I thought you were my friend.

567
00:41:48,378 --> 00:41:49,898
I am your friend.

568
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,320
You know, Hatch, to be honest with you...

569
00:41:54,259 --> 00:41:55,899
...you don't kick well...

570
00:41:56,136 --> 00:41:57,896
...you don't dribble well...

571
00:41:58,305 --> 00:42:00,545
...but you could be a good goalkeeper.

572
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:02,566
-Keep trying.
-Thanks a lot.

573
00:42:02,851 --> 00:42:04,691
He's right. You're not bad.

574
00:42:10,151 --> 00:42:11,671
Ca va, Monsieur Dupin ?

575
00:42:11,777 --> 00:42:13,657
I'm good. Do you have my papers?

576
00:42:13,779 --> 00:42:16,179
I kept my word. It was ready,
but the colonel took it.

577
00:42:16,324 --> 00:42:18,404
-He wants to see you.
-The colonel?

578
00:42:19,452 --> 00:42:21,892
-The colonel took my passport?
-Yes, he did.

579
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:25,250
Thanks.

580
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,114
How's the French coming along?

581
00:42:27,252 --> 00:42:28,852
-Comme ci comme ca.
-You don't need much.

582
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,924
I am going to a funeral. Fine.

583
00:42:31,798 --> 00:42:34,438
Je vais a un enterrement,
something like that.

584
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,085
That's good.

585
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:41,334
Remember to take your identity tag
when you go.

586
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,355
-We don't want you shot as a spy, do we?
-No.

587
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,357
I don't want to be shot as anything.

588
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,599
Au revoir.

589
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,591
He's on his way, sir.

590
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:52,736
Good.

591
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,322
Enter.

592
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,454
Hatch.

593
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,215
-Hello.
-Sit down.

594
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,500
-Cup of tea?
-Yes, please.

595
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:07,253
Tea?

596
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:08,582
Beautiful.

597
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:11,772
God knows what the fellow will do
in civilian life.

598
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:15,205
Make his own pound notes
and share certificates, I shouldn't think.

599
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:16,707
Are you ready?

600
00:43:17,346 --> 00:43:18,266
Pretty near.

601
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:20,227
Anything else we can do for you?

602
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:22,269
No. I just want to thank you all
for helping out.

603
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:24,954
Don't thank us, old boy. It's a team effort.

604
00:43:25,563 --> 00:43:28,203
What Pyrie means is that nowadays
the Germans are up to all the tricks.

605
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:30,957
It's almost impossible
to escape without help.

606
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:34,799
Helping one another is the most
important part of the whole thing.

607
00:43:35,156 --> 00:43:37,996
How would you like to do something
to help us, Hatch?

608
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:40,481
Provided, of course, that you get out.

609
00:43:40,662 --> 00:43:43,342
Which way were you planning to go?

610
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:46,369
To Lyon then to the Swiss border.

611
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:47,743
Switzerland?

612
00:43:48,628 --> 00:43:51,748
I suppose you hadn't thought of
going via Paris, had you?

613
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:53,532
No. Paris? No, sir.

614
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:55,115
I think you'd find it easier.

615
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,180
They wouldn't expect you to go that way.

616
00:43:57,346 --> 00:43:59,746
But I'm still in occupied territory.
Where do I go from there?

617
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,730
We could supply you with contacts,
names, safe houses....

618
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:06,318
You'd be well looked after.

619
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:09,312
No, thanks.

620
00:44:09,776 --> 00:44:12,856
I thank you all for your concern, but
I'm really not planning on seein' Paris...

621
00:44:13,071 --> 00:44:14,671
...until after the war.

622
00:44:19,411 --> 00:44:20,691
Why, Colonel?

623
00:44:22,581 --> 00:44:25,301
We want you to contact
the Resistance for us.

624
00:44:26,293 --> 00:44:27,253
What?

625
00:44:27,628 --> 00:44:30,068
And arrange the escape
of the football team.

626
00:44:41,851 --> 00:44:43,211
Colby's escape?

627
00:44:43,352 --> 00:44:44,352
All of them.

628
00:44:44,478 --> 00:44:45,638
The whole team.

629
00:44:45,771 --> 00:44:47,891
This match is a propaganda stunt
for the Germans.

630
00:44:48,066 --> 00:44:50,706
It's a wonderful opportunity for us.

631
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:52,110
But why send me?

632
00:44:52,237 --> 00:44:54,517
The French may have thought
of all this themselves.

633
00:44:54,656 --> 00:44:56,976
Indeed they may, and then again,
they may not.

634
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,440
We have to get word to them somehow.

635
00:45:08,128 --> 00:45:09,488
What do you want me to do?

636
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:11,670
Find out if an escape is feasible.

637
00:45:11,966 --> 00:45:13,046
Ask them to try it.

638
00:45:13,175 --> 00:45:14,215
If they won't?

639
00:45:14,343 --> 00:45:15,463
They won't.

640
00:45:16,137 --> 00:45:18,977
But they'd help you
to get to Spain or Switzerland.

641
00:45:25,271 --> 00:45:26,871
I suppose I could do that.

642
00:45:27,565 --> 00:45:28,725
Wonderful.

643
00:45:29,234 --> 00:45:32,274
-Thank you.
-I'll go over the details with you tonight.

644
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:34,856
-Not a word to Colby.
-He'll have to know something.

645
00:45:35,031 --> 00:45:37,511
He'll have to know you're going,
but not why.

646
00:45:43,498 --> 00:45:45,218
I really don't believe this.

647
00:45:45,334 --> 00:45:46,334
What?

648
00:45:50,422 --> 00:45:52,662
This frigging game is wrecking my life.

649
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:57,090
Good luck.

650
00:46:26,627 --> 00:46:27,867
Red Cross.

651
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,060
-Good?
-Good.

652
00:47:38,786 --> 00:47:40,266
All the best, Hatch.

653
00:47:40,955 --> 00:47:42,435
I hope he makes it.

654
00:49:35,616 --> 00:49:37,216
Stay close to it. Easy.

655
00:49:37,827 --> 00:49:38,907
Easy.

656
00:49:55,595 --> 00:49:57,395
Achtung. Achtung.

657
00:49:57,973 --> 00:49:59,373
Lights out.

658
00:50:01,935 --> 00:50:03,415
Lights out.

659
00:53:55,346 --> 00:53:58,306
That was a wonderful evening, darling.

660
00:54:09,819 --> 00:54:12,339
See you tomorrow. Sleep well.

661
00:54:44,564 --> 00:54:45,804
Open the gate.

662
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,340
For Paris, please.

663
00:55:36,285 --> 00:55:38,245
You must change in Strasbourg.

664
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:48,172
Come on! We must go. Hurry up!

665
00:55:53,094 --> 00:55:54,534
All aboard, please.

666
00:55:57,807 --> 00:56:00,087
What is the purpose of your trip?

667
00:56:01,811 --> 00:56:03,811
Do you speak French?

668
00:56:05,649 --> 00:56:07,209
-Don't you speak German?
-No.

669
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,559
I'm going to a funeral in Paris.

670
00:56:12,573 --> 00:56:14,413
I'm going to a funeral.

671
00:56:17,661 --> 00:56:19,421
My dear, wait.

672
00:58:25,128 --> 00:58:26,968
Quetsche, s'il vous plait.

673
00:58:35,472 --> 00:58:36,392
Merci.

674
00:58:47,651 --> 00:58:48,771
Alors, salut.

675
00:58:55,993 --> 00:58:57,073
Un autre.

676
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:58,410
Oui.

677
00:59:20,352 --> 00:59:22,872
We don't even know
when or how they'll do the transfer.

678
00:59:23,022 --> 00:59:25,102
'Cause the Germans
could take them one by one.

679
00:59:25,274 --> 00:59:27,994
It all seems risky to me.

680
00:59:28,194 --> 00:59:32,394
Well, I don't know. It seems too soon
to make a decision like that. Tell him.

681
00:59:36,285 --> 00:59:37,365
Mister...

682
00:59:37,787 --> 00:59:39,267
...the answer is "no."

683
00:59:40,164 --> 00:59:41,644
That's what I figured.

684
00:59:42,876 --> 00:59:44,916
We do not know
where they would stay in Paris...

685
00:59:45,045 --> 00:59:47,645
...and I do not want a battle in the streets.

686
00:59:47,881 --> 00:59:51,881
The Germans will have a whole battalion
at least at the Colombes Stadium.

687
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,700
The Colombes Stadium?

688
00:59:54,054 --> 00:59:56,214
Why didn't you say so before?

689
00:59:56,598 --> 00:59:59,438
My friends, the Paris sewer system
branches off just below...

690
00:59:59,643 --> 01:00:01,643
...the foundations of the stadium.

691
01:00:02,563 --> 01:00:04,283
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

692
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,920
Did I not work in the sewers 20 years ago?

693
01:00:06,067 --> 01:00:07,587
What'd he say?

694
01:00:08,235 --> 01:00:10,675
There were sewers there,
sewers going into the Seine.

695
01:00:10,863 --> 01:00:12,583
It's covered over now.

696
01:00:13,825 --> 01:00:15,145
Who knows.

697
01:00:23,668 --> 01:00:25,788
We will have a look. Okay? Bonsoir.

698
01:00:25,962 --> 01:00:27,162
What am I supposed to do?

699
01:00:27,255 --> 01:00:28,975
You will stay with Renee, please.

700
01:00:29,132 --> 01:00:31,532
The house is safe. Okay? Goodbye.

701
01:00:33,011 --> 01:00:34,091
Salut.

702
01:00:37,766 --> 01:00:39,486
-Bye, Renee.
-Good night.

703
01:00:56,578 --> 01:00:58,498
Thanks. No. Merci.

704
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:03,833
Look, lady, I just said thanks.
No offense.

705
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,160
We are both on the same side, aren't we?

706
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:07,543
Please.

707
01:01:08,257 --> 01:01:09,337
I just wanted to talk.

708
01:01:09,466 --> 01:01:12,066
It's been a long time
since I talked to a woman.

709
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:16,303
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Parlez-vous English?

710
01:01:16,807 --> 01:01:18,527
I understand you very well.

711
01:01:19,393 --> 01:01:21,353
Good. Then why don't you sit down
and we'll talk.

712
01:01:21,562 --> 01:01:23,402
Hatch. My friends call me Hatch.

713
01:01:23,564 --> 01:01:24,524
No.

714
01:01:25,733 --> 01:01:27,173
You don't want to be my friend?

715
01:01:27,318 --> 01:01:28,958
I didn't want to hear your name.

716
01:01:29,112 --> 01:01:32,352
And now that I do, I don't want to hear
anything else about you.

717
01:01:32,574 --> 01:01:34,334
The less I know, the better it is for you.

718
01:01:34,492 --> 01:01:35,772
And for you?

719
01:01:35,994 --> 01:01:37,354
And for me, too.

720
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:40,079
My bein' here has put you
and your friends in a tough spot.

721
01:01:40,248 --> 01:01:41,408
Is that why you're mad?

722
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,580
I'm not mad.

723
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:46,980
But being in a tough spot,
as you call it, is where I choose to be.

724
01:01:47,381 --> 01:01:49,661
How do you feel about me being here?

725
01:01:50,134 --> 01:01:51,454
How do I feel?

726
01:01:51,927 --> 01:01:54,127
I feel responsible, hopeful.

727
01:01:55,264 --> 01:01:58,064
When I get word that someone
I sheltered is safe, then I'm happy.

728
01:01:58,225 --> 01:01:59,785
I can forget them.

729
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:03,279
But when I hear
that they've been caught or killed...

730
01:02:03,481 --> 01:02:05,601
...then I remember everything.

731
01:02:06,859 --> 01:02:09,219
I remember their faces, their voices.

732
01:02:10,238 --> 01:02:13,678
What they said about their parents,
their child, their pets.

733
01:02:14,534 --> 01:02:16,374
And I mourn for them.

734
01:02:17,329 --> 01:02:19,209
I don't want to mourn for you.

735
01:02:19,873 --> 01:02:21,913
Well, you're safe with me, Renee.

736
01:02:22,417 --> 01:02:23,457
How?

737
01:02:24,294 --> 01:02:27,174
Well, I'm an orphan. A bastard.

738
01:02:27,965 --> 01:02:30,805
I have no parents.
No money. I'm not married.

739
01:02:31,343 --> 01:02:33,423
No children. I don't even have a pet.

740
01:02:33,554 --> 01:02:37,634
And anything I might say in my sleep
to the contrary can't be held against me.

741
01:02:38,518 --> 01:02:39,998
Do you live here alone?

742
01:02:40,144 --> 01:02:41,144
No.

743
01:02:43,773 --> 01:02:44,813
Are you married?

744
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:47,301
He got killed, the first week of the war.

745
01:02:48,236 --> 01:02:49,316
Sorry.

746
01:02:49,738 --> 01:02:51,138
Who do you live with?

747
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:52,519
With Francois.

748
01:02:52,699 --> 01:02:54,219
Is that your boyfriend?

749
01:02:54,409 --> 01:02:58,129
It's late. I'll have him move out
of his room so you can sleep there.

750
01:02:59,248 --> 01:03:00,248
Wait.

751
01:03:00,332 --> 01:03:02,132
You don't have to get Francois up.

752
01:03:02,251 --> 01:03:05,651
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I can sleep here on the couch.

753
01:03:07,089 --> 01:03:08,409
My son, Francois.

754
01:03:47,131 --> 01:03:48,931
Herr Kommandant.

755
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:17,730
The American's escape
has put me in a very bad position...

756
01:04:17,871 --> 01:04:20,271
...with the Kommandant
and the high command.

757
01:04:20,624 --> 01:04:23,104
Hatch's escape had nothing to do
with my team.

758
01:04:23,294 --> 01:04:24,894
That was his own idea.

759
01:04:25,421 --> 01:04:27,181
Your men covered for him.

760
01:04:27,798 --> 01:04:29,638
What would you expect them to do?

761
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,120
What would you do?

762
01:04:32,595 --> 01:04:36,315
I want your word that there'll be
no attempt to escape from the team.

763
01:04:37,183 --> 01:04:38,423
Scouts' honor.

764
01:04:41,021 --> 01:04:43,261
The idea of the match was friendly.

765
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:45,290
That was the idea.

766
01:04:45,984 --> 01:04:47,424
I want your word.

767
01:04:48,737 --> 01:04:50,257
I can't give it to you.

768
01:04:53,867 --> 01:04:56,827
You will all be very closely guarded.

769
01:04:58,205 --> 01:04:59,285
All right.

770
01:06:08,237 --> 01:06:12,077
And down the sewer here we discovered
a foundation pipe of the stadium.

771
01:06:13,868 --> 01:06:15,188
Sounds good to me.

772
01:06:15,369 --> 01:06:16,329
But...

773
01:06:17,163 --> 01:06:19,523
...we must make sure which one it is.

774
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:23,433
We have to find the original plans.

775
01:06:23,753 --> 01:06:26,473
We think the best chance to escape...

776
01:06:26,631 --> 01:06:29,111
...will be from the visitors' dressing room.

777
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:31,839
Maybe they'll be left alone at halftime.

778
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:32,970
Maybe.

779
01:06:33,388 --> 01:06:36,548
But we can run into a concrete wall.
Anything can happen.

780
01:06:44,399 --> 01:06:46,039
You will have to go back.

781
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:49,237
What?

782
01:06:49,655 --> 01:06:51,015
To the camp.

783
01:06:51,157 --> 01:06:52,437
To tell them.

784
01:06:53,159 --> 01:06:54,319
The team.

785
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:57,451
They must know that we'll be there.

786
01:06:57,622 --> 01:06:59,702
It took me a year to get out of there.

787
01:06:59,832 --> 01:07:01,232
We need a contact.

788
01:07:01,501 --> 01:07:04,421
Colby must know, and also your colonel.

789
01:07:04,837 --> 01:07:06,117
That's not my problem.

790
01:07:06,256 --> 01:07:07,376
You believe that?

791
01:07:07,507 --> 01:07:09,147
I don't know what to believe.

792
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,340
I don't. I mean....

793
01:07:10,468 --> 01:07:12,788
What am I supposed to do?
Break back into the camp?

794
01:07:12,971 --> 01:07:14,451
No. You get captured.

795
01:07:14,723 --> 01:07:15,963
Get captured.

796
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:18,059
All right, suppose I get captured?

797
01:07:18,185 --> 01:07:20,705
Then they send me to the wrong
prisoner camp. What about that?

798
01:07:20,854 --> 01:07:22,974
-No, no.
-Now, what about that?

799
01:07:23,524 --> 01:07:25,644
The Germans will take you
to the same place...

800
01:07:25,818 --> 01:07:28,978
...to show the other prisoners
that you are not a success.

801
01:07:31,073 --> 01:07:32,873
You got all the answers, don't you?

802
01:07:33,034 --> 01:07:33,954
Yes.

803
01:07:35,786 --> 01:07:37,706
Mister, you will leave tomorrow.

804
01:07:40,792 --> 01:07:42,672
-Tomorrow?
-Yes, tomorrow.

805
01:07:46,965 --> 01:07:49,165
This friggin' soccer game.

806
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,780
I'll leave you my papers.

807
01:07:57,142 --> 01:07:58,542
They're pretty good.

808
01:07:59,728 --> 01:08:02,048
I'm sure somebody will be able to use 'em.

809
01:08:03,023 --> 01:08:04,103
All right?

810
01:08:50,448 --> 01:08:51,568
He's back.

811
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,040
Schnell.

812
01:08:57,121 --> 01:08:58,281
Thank you.

813
01:09:08,508 --> 01:09:09,748
March, march.

814
01:09:11,512 --> 01:09:13,952
So, our Hatch knows his mythology.

815
01:09:14,807 --> 01:09:16,127
What does it mean?

816
01:09:16,725 --> 01:09:17,885
Mercury.

817
01:09:18,602 --> 01:09:20,282
Messenger of the gods.

818
01:09:20,563 --> 01:09:22,323
No flies on Rosey.

819
01:09:22,523 --> 01:09:23,683
News, eh?

820
01:09:24,025 --> 01:09:25,985
How do we find out what it is?

821
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,800
Good question.

822
01:09:34,410 --> 01:09:37,210
We sent him to Paris on your behalf.

823
01:09:38,331 --> 01:09:39,811
Yours and the team's.

824
01:09:41,334 --> 01:09:42,334
Colonel...

825
01:09:42,794 --> 01:09:45,194
...l don't know what you're talking about.

826
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,359
We sent him to Paris
to arrange your escape.

827
01:09:48,634 --> 01:09:50,394
-Hatch did that for you?
-No.

828
01:09:51,178 --> 01:09:53,378
-For you.
-We could argue about that.

829
01:09:54,431 --> 01:09:55,391
Why didn't you tell me?

830
01:09:55,516 --> 01:09:58,236
No point, really,
unless he managed to arrange something.

831
01:09:58,436 --> 01:10:00,516
He appears to have been successful.

832
01:10:00,688 --> 01:10:03,088
The snag is he can't tell us.

833
01:10:03,441 --> 01:10:05,321
He'll be in the cooler until after the match.

834
01:10:05,485 --> 01:10:08,365
Then you'll just have to get him
out of there, won't you?

835
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:09,731
Excuse me.

836
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:12,050
I have a training session.

837
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,880
Just a minute. Colby....

838
01:10:15,036 --> 01:10:17,636
I know you wanted to play for the sake
of those Eastern Europeans.

839
01:10:17,831 --> 01:10:19,271
I admire you for it.

840
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:23,458
But you and I both know that you risk
a court martial for this after the war.

841
01:10:23,754 --> 01:10:25,434
What have you accomplished?

842
01:10:25,547 --> 01:10:27,347
Give them a couple of weeks of life?

843
01:10:27,508 --> 01:10:30,508
And what is going to happen to them
after your match is over?

844
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:34,399
For the same reason
that you wanted to play you must escape.

845
01:10:35,057 --> 01:10:36,297
If you can.

846
01:10:36,684 --> 01:10:38,124
What can I do?

847
01:10:38,269 --> 01:10:40,109
I can't get him out of there.

848
01:10:40,521 --> 01:10:43,361
Now, Hatch is officially your trainer,
isn't he?

849
01:10:45,026 --> 01:10:47,946
Von Steiner and the camp Kommandant
won't buy that one.

850
01:10:48,696 --> 01:10:50,976
You'll have to think of something else.

851
01:11:05,923 --> 01:11:07,243
Crazy Yank.

852
01:11:18,478 --> 01:11:20,678
You, Colonel Waldron and Major Rose...

853
01:11:20,938 --> 01:11:24,898
...will travel to Paris along with
other senior officers from various camps...

854
01:11:25,109 --> 01:11:27,029
...to represent your countries.

855
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:29,438
I won't do it.

856
01:11:30,365 --> 01:11:31,365
You have no choice.

857
01:11:31,491 --> 01:11:32,891
Then I'll travel...

858
01:11:33,452 --> 01:11:35,852
...but I won't represent anything.

859
01:11:37,247 --> 01:11:38,567
You will be seen.

860
01:11:40,793 --> 01:11:42,033
The team...

861
01:11:42,461 --> 01:11:45,181
...will be ready to travel at midday
on Thursday.

862
01:11:45,839 --> 01:11:47,879
Further arrangements
will be announced later.

863
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:50,370
One of my men is
in the punishment block.

864
01:11:50,511 --> 01:11:51,711
In solitary.

865
01:11:51,846 --> 01:11:54,086
I can give you a trainer.
You don't need him.

866
01:11:54,265 --> 01:11:55,865
Hatch is my goalkeeper.

867
01:11:56,851 --> 01:11:58,491
The American? No.

868
01:11:58,895 --> 01:12:00,775
Tony Lewis is your goalkeeper.

869
01:12:00,939 --> 01:12:02,339
He's broken his arm.

870
01:12:06,403 --> 01:12:07,643
When did this happen?

871
01:12:07,779 --> 01:12:08,699
This morning.

872
01:12:08,822 --> 01:12:10,262
Put someone else in goal.

873
01:12:10,365 --> 01:12:11,965
Hatch is my best man.

874
01:12:12,993 --> 01:12:15,433
I thought the idea was
to give us a chance.

875
01:12:15,662 --> 01:12:17,062
This is the idea.

876
01:12:21,961 --> 01:12:25,601
If the camp doctor verifies
this broken arm...

877
01:12:26,257 --> 01:12:28,057
...you may have the American.

878
01:12:28,384 --> 01:12:29,464
Thank you.

879
01:12:34,682 --> 01:12:35,842
Well, Tony?

880
01:12:38,478 --> 01:12:40,758
Try and make it a clean break, will ya?

881
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:42,723
I'll try.

882
01:12:43,149 --> 01:12:45,549
I won't even get to see the game, will l?

883
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:48,300
Sit on the bed.

884
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,952
Put your arm between those two.

885
01:12:52,075 --> 01:12:53,515
Okay.

886
01:14:28,092 --> 01:14:30,372
-Are you going to put those up?
-Yes, sir.

887
01:14:30,553 --> 01:14:32,273
Which is the team for home?

888
01:14:49,657 --> 01:14:51,657
Then the prisoners shall have it.

889
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:53,305
We'll have the other.

890
01:15:00,168 --> 01:15:01,968
-The other is the same?
-Yes, sir.

891
01:15:02,128 --> 01:15:03,288
Good.

892
01:15:21,899 --> 01:15:24,539
Colby, I don't know
how to play this game, so...

893
01:15:24,985 --> 01:15:27,065
...where do I stand for the corner kick?

894
01:15:27,196 --> 01:15:28,196
What?

895
01:15:28,572 --> 01:15:32,612
I said, I'm not very good at the game.
Where do I stand for the corner kick?

896
01:15:33,869 --> 01:15:35,309
Go to sleep, Hatch.

897
01:20:32,974 --> 01:20:34,094
Excuse me.

898
01:20:58,042 --> 01:20:59,042
Colby?

899
01:20:59,418 --> 01:21:00,378
What?

900
01:21:00,878 --> 01:21:02,998
Where do I stand for a corner kick?

901
01:21:05,383 --> 01:21:07,783
The far post, facing the ball.

902
01:21:09,971 --> 01:21:13,411
Thanks. For a while there,
I thought you were keeping it a secret.

903
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:58,711
Mesdames et messieurs.

904
01:24:18,876 --> 01:24:21,556
So, a hearty welcome
to all our listeners in England.

905
01:24:21,754 --> 01:24:25,474
There are just a few minutes to go
before the kickoff of this historic match.

906
01:24:25,717 --> 01:24:29,357
This great crowd of about 50,000
really has something to look forward to...

907
01:24:29,596 --> 01:24:31,476
...during the next 90 minutes.

908
01:24:32,099 --> 01:24:34,299
To insure fair play
and good sportsmanship...

909
01:24:34,434 --> 01:24:37,954
...the German organizers have picked
a neutral to referee the match.

910
01:24:38,188 --> 01:24:39,868
And he is now ready...

911
01:24:40,024 --> 01:24:41,464
...for the toss of the coin.

912
01:24:41,608 --> 01:24:42,048
Heads.

913
01:24:42,109 --> 01:24:44,709
The winner will have his choice
of kicking off or defending.

914
01:24:44,904 --> 01:24:47,584
But will most probably choose to play
towards the east goal...

915
01:24:47,782 --> 01:24:49,582
...with the wind in his favor.

916
01:24:50,952 --> 01:24:53,112
And the Allies will kick off
this great event.

917
01:24:53,287 --> 01:24:56,727
Well, I tell you, years from now
men will say of this game:

918
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:58,198
"Did it happen?"

919
01:24:58,334 --> 01:25:02,134
Well, I tell you in the listening audience:
Today, it is happening.

920
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:05,517
We're all witness to an occasion
long to be remembered.

921
01:25:05,717 --> 01:25:07,837
Not just propaganda, as some would say...

922
01:25:08,011 --> 01:25:10,571
...but as a magnificent sporting spectacle.

923
01:25:22,359 --> 01:25:23,599
Hatch.

924
01:25:25,571 --> 01:25:27,411
Hatch. Halftime.

925
01:25:27,531 --> 01:25:29,011
All right. Thanks.

926
01:25:29,951 --> 01:25:31,191
What'd he say?

927
01:25:31,327 --> 01:25:33,087
That it's on for halftime.

928
01:25:43,632 --> 01:25:45,192
Here's to victory.

929
01:25:53,225 --> 01:25:54,865
Let's go. Let's play ball.

930
01:25:55,019 --> 01:25:56,139
Play hard, eh?

931
01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:57,590
Let's play hard.

932
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:02,710
Harmer kicks off for the Allies...

933
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:04,300
...and the game has begun.

934
01:26:04,445 --> 01:26:05,725
You'd have a job getting...

935
01:26:05,863 --> 01:26:08,983
...twenty-two better players than are
out there on the pitch right now.

936
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,280
The Allies are playing it very cool.

937
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:17,810
And Pauls of Denmark
makes it deep and shoots.

938
01:26:18,293 --> 01:26:20,293
Very close.

939
01:26:20,545 --> 01:26:24,225
The ball is back in play by Schmidt,
Germany's legendary goalkeeper.

940
01:26:25,509 --> 01:26:27,829
Reinhart, Reinhart to Becker...

941
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:30,020
...to Baumann, Number 4...

942
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:31,660
...forward now to Brandt...

943
01:26:31,807 --> 01:26:33,447
...back to Albrecht, Number 11 .

944
01:26:33,601 --> 01:26:35,241
Albrecht out to the left.

945
01:26:37,229 --> 01:26:39,309
He beats Number 4.

946
01:26:39,482 --> 01:26:42,082
-Watch him.
-Watch my back, watch my back.

947
01:26:42,818 --> 01:26:44,178
Watch out, Hatch.

948
01:26:50,869 --> 01:26:52,789
There's your corner kick, Hatch.

949
01:26:54,456 --> 01:26:57,256
-The guy drove me out.
-To the right, to the right.

950
01:26:58,877 --> 01:27:00,877
Watch him back there. Watch him.

951
01:27:02,089 --> 01:27:04,009
Watch him, watch him there.

952
01:27:05,467 --> 01:27:07,827
Come on, lads, eye on the ball. Come on.

953
01:27:08,387 --> 01:27:10,547
-Now, pick him up.
-Come on, guys.

954
01:27:10,764 --> 01:27:12,364
I got it.

955
01:27:13,309 --> 01:27:14,669
It's a goal.

956
01:27:17,438 --> 01:27:19,038
Germany one, the Allies nil.

957
01:27:24,487 --> 01:27:26,847
And listen to that applause.

958
01:27:28,241 --> 01:27:30,321
The crowd is going wild.

959
01:27:33,747 --> 01:27:35,347
Take it easy. You're as tight as a drum.

960
01:27:35,499 --> 01:27:39,379
-Just give it to halftime, Colby.
-Don't let them pull you off your line.

961
01:27:47,553 --> 01:27:49,273
That's a foul.

962
01:27:50,973 --> 01:27:51,893
Watch him.

963
01:27:52,016 --> 01:27:54,496
Come on. Stick with it. That's it.

964
01:27:55,227 --> 01:27:56,667
That's it. Come on.

965
01:28:00,316 --> 01:28:01,836
Referee, look at this.

966
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:03,150
Get it out.

967
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,398
Watch him back there. Watch him.

968
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:05,889
Play the ball.

969
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:16,756
Germany two, Allies nil.

970
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:44,599
Come out, Hatch.

971
01:29:02,631 --> 01:29:05,031
Don't lose your temper. It's okay.

972
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,840
Everybody, out. Out! Out!

973
01:29:17,063 --> 01:29:18,143
Take it.

974
01:30:03,779 --> 01:30:04,699
Bravo.

975
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:06,700
Come on, Luis.

976
01:30:15,332 --> 01:30:16,372
In the penalty area.

977
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:19,538
The referee will probably call a penalty.
And he does.

978
01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:29,890
This is the fella here. This is the one.

979
01:30:30,056 --> 01:30:32,456
I'll calm my team, but you calm them.

980
01:30:34,978 --> 01:30:37,458
The referee trying to settle them down,
and the call will remain.

981
01:30:37,647 --> 01:30:40,287
It will be a penalty kick, one on one.

982
01:30:41,735 --> 01:30:43,375
Hatch, the goalkeeper...

983
01:30:43,695 --> 01:30:47,175
...he'll have to be on his line,
that's 12 yards away.

984
01:30:48,117 --> 01:30:51,157
He's not allowed to move
until the ball has been struck.

985
01:30:52,204 --> 01:30:55,764
Yes, indeed. Germany's great Baumann
will take the kick.

986
01:31:16,897 --> 01:31:19,697
Goal. He sends the ball past Hatch.

987
01:31:19,858 --> 01:31:22,738
And it's three to nothing
in favor of Germany.

988
01:31:40,254 --> 01:31:42,774
The Allies kick off again. It's Ray.

989
01:31:43,007 --> 01:31:45,847
Ray to Fernandez. Fernandez back to Ray.

990
01:31:46,219 --> 01:31:48,139
And we have seen
some very good football.

991
01:31:48,304 --> 01:31:50,464
Very fortunate for us, indeed,
considering that...

992
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:52,800
...there are no international games
being played now.

993
01:31:55,604 --> 01:31:57,124
Baumann makes a beautiful tackle.

994
01:31:57,272 --> 01:32:00,232
Dispossesses him, and the Germans
are again on the attack.

995
01:32:01,610 --> 01:32:03,930
Watch your back, watch your back.

996
01:32:08,409 --> 01:32:09,569
I'll get it.

997
01:32:09,743 --> 01:32:10,863
It's good.

998
01:32:18,127 --> 01:32:19,287
Goal for the Germans.

999
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:20,540
Four, nil.

1000
01:32:24,843 --> 01:32:26,323
Stay on the bloody line, I told you.

1001
01:32:26,469 --> 01:32:27,309
I missed.

1002
01:32:27,429 --> 01:32:29,789
Stay on the line
and narrow the angle down.

1003
01:32:30,015 --> 01:32:32,255
When they come in, narrow the angle.

1004
01:33:23,154 --> 01:33:25,914
We'll play ten men.
I'll go forward, you cover that back.

1005
01:33:26,115 --> 01:33:27,995
This isn't going to be easy.

1006
01:33:37,961 --> 01:33:40,041
We've taken enough, mates.
Let's get 'em.

1007
01:33:40,213 --> 01:33:42,373
The Allies are playing with ten men.

1008
01:33:43,008 --> 01:33:46,968
Interesting, because Colby has chosen
to give this advantage to the Germans.

1009
01:34:01,068 --> 01:34:02,588
Good. On you go, come on.

1010
01:34:30,015 --> 01:34:31,575
Get it out.

1011
01:34:38,733 --> 01:34:40,133
Referee, look at--

1012
01:34:41,402 --> 01:34:43,162
Keep playing it, lads.

1013
01:35:13,435 --> 01:35:16,475
Four to one, and less than a minute
to go to the halftime.

1014
01:35:16,731 --> 01:35:19,451
This kind of action takes me back
to the World Cup of '38...

1015
01:35:19,609 --> 01:35:22,329
...played right here
in Colombes Stadium in Paris.

1016
01:35:30,453 --> 01:35:32,853
We did it. We made it.

1017
01:35:36,459 --> 01:35:38,699
The end of 45 minutes of play.

1018
01:35:38,879 --> 01:35:41,399
And it's been a brilliant first half.

1019
01:35:41,882 --> 01:35:44,962
I don't know about you,
but I can say for myself....

1020
01:35:52,476 --> 01:35:53,716
Well done, lads.

1021
01:35:55,688 --> 01:35:57,608
Hatch, we got you to halftime.

1022
01:36:00,902 --> 01:36:02,302
Let's see.

1023
01:36:06,950 --> 01:36:08,710
Fantastic, Terry. At least we put up a--

1024
01:36:08,827 --> 01:36:10,227
-We scored a goal.
-Oh, yeah?

1025
01:36:10,328 --> 01:36:12,488
-Who scored?
-Terry scored a goal.

1026
01:36:13,206 --> 01:36:15,326
Fantastic. What's the score?

1027
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:18,500
Four to one. But at least
we scored a goal, one time.

1028
01:36:19,713 --> 01:36:21,953
We're doin' good. It's gonna be all right.

1029
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:26,580
Way to go, guys.

1030
01:36:48,868 --> 01:36:50,348
What's happening?

1031
01:36:50,787 --> 01:36:52,907
All right, we're getting out of here.

1032
01:36:53,206 --> 01:36:54,206
How?

1033
01:36:54,666 --> 01:36:57,346
Our escape has been arranged
all the way to the Seine River.

1034
01:36:57,544 --> 01:36:59,744
Once we get on the other side,
we're gonna blow the tunnel.

1035
01:36:59,922 --> 01:37:02,762
There's a boat waiting for us
and in one hour we'll be in the country.

1036
01:37:02,967 --> 01:37:03,967
All right?

1037
01:37:25,073 --> 01:37:26,233
Salut.

1038
01:37:28,076 --> 01:37:29,316
Vite. Vite.

1039
01:37:31,455 --> 01:37:32,975
Vite. Vite. Vite.

1040
01:37:33,749 --> 01:37:35,269
Colby, you take the lead off,
I'll bring up the rear.

1041
01:37:35,417 --> 01:37:37,177
Okay. Get Luis and Pieter.

1042
01:37:37,461 --> 01:37:39,621
-I don't want to go.
-Just shut up and get in there.

1043
01:37:39,755 --> 01:37:41,315
We can beat them.

1044
01:37:41,674 --> 01:37:42,874
Bring Pieter over.

1045
01:37:43,008 --> 01:37:44,128
We've still got a chance.

1046
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:45,780
Chance, my ass.

1047
01:37:46,262 --> 01:37:47,182
Hatch, don't you see?

1048
01:37:47,305 --> 01:37:49,185
You nuts or somethin'?
You have no chance.

1049
01:37:49,348 --> 01:37:51,188
Don't you understand? No chance.

1050
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:52,830
Get Pieter ready next.

1051
01:37:58,066 --> 01:37:58,706
Hey.

1052
01:37:59,150 --> 01:38:00,190
Come on, let's go.

1053
01:38:00,318 --> 01:38:02,198
Don't worry. Come on. Hurry.

1054
01:38:03,738 --> 01:38:06,298
I don't want to go.
Let's go back. We can win this.

1055
01:38:06,450 --> 01:38:07,570
-Who said that?
-I did.

1056
01:38:07,701 --> 01:38:09,341
It's not as though
we're being slaughtered, Skipper.

1057
01:38:09,453 --> 01:38:11,253
What do you mean, we can win?

1058
01:38:11,914 --> 01:38:14,114
-Wait a minute.
-Colby, we're losin' time.

1059
01:38:14,291 --> 01:38:16,131
You mean you'd go back
and play the second half?

1060
01:38:16,293 --> 01:38:17,853
Move. We've only got a few minutes.

1061
01:38:17,962 --> 01:38:18,962
Yes, but we could win this.

1062
01:38:19,088 --> 01:38:20,568
You could never, with me as the goal.

1063
01:38:20,714 --> 01:38:22,554
Of course, we can.
He's not a bad goalie, is he?

1064
01:38:22,717 --> 01:38:24,437
What's the matter with you?
You want to go back to prison?

1065
01:38:24,594 --> 01:38:25,874
-Come back, we need you.
-That's right.

1066
01:38:26,012 --> 01:38:27,492
You guys do what you want,
but I'm leavin'.

1067
01:38:27,638 --> 01:38:29,358
-You're quitting.
-I ain't goin' back to prison.

1068
01:38:29,515 --> 01:38:31,715
You've got to come back. If you don't--

1069
01:38:31,976 --> 01:38:34,496
-I waited too long to get out.
-If you don't come back, we can't go.

1070
01:38:34,687 --> 01:38:37,327
Hatch, if you go,
we've all got to go with you.

1071
01:38:37,524 --> 01:38:39,524
We can't go back without the goalie.

1072
01:38:39,651 --> 01:38:41,211
-Hatch, come on.
-Hatch.

1073
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:43,140
Please, Hatch.

1074
01:38:43,655 --> 01:38:45,295
That game means a lot to us.

1075
01:38:45,449 --> 01:38:46,609
You know that.

1076
01:38:46,783 --> 01:38:47,863
You must go back.

1077
01:38:47,993 --> 01:38:49,673
-Hatch, let's go.
-Please.

1078
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,776
We can win.

1079
01:38:51,955 --> 01:38:53,355
Come on.

1080
01:38:53,666 --> 01:38:56,746
If we run now, we lose more than a game.

1081
01:38:57,461 --> 01:38:58,741
Please, Hatch.

1082
01:39:30,579 --> 01:39:32,499
Good luck, Hatch. Good luck.

1083
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:10,959
Come on, lads, let's get 'em.

1084
01:40:17,837 --> 01:40:19,477
The Allies are playing above themselves.

1085
01:40:19,589 --> 01:40:21,629
Throwing everything into
a desperate attack.

1086
01:40:54,292 --> 01:40:56,612
Very quickly the Allies have come back
with a goal.

1087
01:40:56,794 --> 01:40:58,354
And it's four to two.

1088
01:40:59,505 --> 01:41:01,265
Come on, run with it.

1089
01:41:03,218 --> 01:41:04,818
Right tackle, Roy.

1090
01:41:21,528 --> 01:41:23,808
Fifteen minutes remaining
of this incredible game...

1091
01:41:23,989 --> 01:41:26,109
...and you won't see many
better than this.

1092
01:42:04,532 --> 01:42:06,092
A marvelous game.

1093
01:42:06,242 --> 01:42:09,562
We anticipated it, and so far, it's a sizzler.

1094
01:42:09,745 --> 01:42:11,585
The Germans are in top form.

1095
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:12,962
Get lost.

1096
01:43:13,103 --> 01:43:15,023
Get me in there. Break fast.

1097
01:43:41,216 --> 01:43:43,976
The goal has been disallowed. No goal.

1098
01:43:44,761 --> 01:43:46,481
The goal has been disallowed.

1099
01:43:46,638 --> 01:43:48,478
What do you mean, no goal?

1100
01:43:49,391 --> 01:43:51,191
That's a bloody lie.

1101
01:43:55,564 --> 01:43:58,284
That's a bloody lie.
All right lads, we've been had.

1102
01:43:58,484 --> 01:44:00,724
This game has had all the drama.

1103
01:44:01,195 --> 01:44:03,315
An equalizing goal not allowed...

1104
01:44:03,489 --> 01:44:06,729
...so the Allies are still behind
three goals to four.

1105
01:44:10,914 --> 01:44:12,154
I want to play.

1106
01:44:12,332 --> 01:44:14,692
-You can't play like that.
-I feel good. I feel better.

1107
01:44:14,876 --> 01:44:17,156
-I must play.
-Ref, he's coming back on.

1108
01:44:27,222 --> 01:44:28,102
I'm okay.

1109
01:44:28,182 --> 01:44:30,422
...into the football festival
and only four minutes remaining.

1110
01:44:30,601 --> 01:44:32,761
-All right, lads, let's go.
-They're all very crucial.

1111
01:44:32,937 --> 01:44:35,737
The Germans are powerful,
and very strong.

1112
01:45:09,558 --> 01:45:11,038
Stick with him, boy.

1113
01:46:36,483 --> 01:46:38,403
Victory. Victory.

1114
01:46:38,526 --> 01:46:40,606
Victory. Victory.

1115
01:46:43,031 --> 01:46:45,391
Victory. Victory.

1116
01:46:46,326 --> 01:46:48,326
Victory. Victory.

1117
01:46:48,579 --> 01:46:50,459
Victory. Victory.

1118
01:46:50,664 --> 01:46:52,664
Victory. Victory.

1119
01:46:52,833 --> 01:46:54,793
Victory. Victory.

1120
01:46:57,087 --> 01:46:58,927
Victory. Victory.

1121
01:46:59,173 --> 01:47:01,053
Victory. Victory.

1122
01:47:01,217 --> 01:47:02,817
Victory. Victory.

1123
01:47:08,683 --> 01:47:11,483
And so we're ready to pick up
where we left off in the action.

1124
01:47:27,953 --> 01:47:29,673
Very good, keep going.

1125
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:38,560
And Schmidt, one of the best goalkeepers
in the world...

1126
01:47:38,756 --> 01:47:41,556
...showing us again
that he's not lost any of his skills.

1127
01:47:42,051 --> 01:47:43,691
About a minute remaining.

1128
01:47:44,470 --> 01:47:46,830
Schmidt left foots it down the field.

1129
01:47:47,390 --> 01:47:49,510
The Germans have a lovely ball.

1130
01:47:50,226 --> 01:47:52,786
It's Baumann. Baumann is...

1131
01:47:53,271 --> 01:47:55,751
...brought down in the penalty area.

1132
01:47:56,149 --> 01:47:58,629
The referee responds and rightfully so.

1133
01:47:58,819 --> 01:48:01,739
A deliberate foul by Ray
as the clock runs out.

1134
01:48:01,989 --> 01:48:03,629
And the penalty collects.

1135
01:48:10,331 --> 01:48:13,691
And at the very end of the game
they've resorted to fouling.

1136
01:48:14,168 --> 01:48:16,208
What a sad way to end this game.

1137
01:48:16,379 --> 01:48:18,339
This is not fair.

1138
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:50,680
Come on, Hatch. Come on.
