00:01:01,213 --> 00:01:02,612
Last on Roots:

2
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:06,852
- Master made me head trainer today.
- That nice.

3
00:01:07,093 --> 00:01:10,688
I'll pit them birds
until I can buy myself free.

4
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:13,242
You'll stay and fight chickens.

5
00:01:13,493 --> 00:01:15,848
It don't matter how much I saves.

6
00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:17,691
You're mine, George.

7
00:01:17,893 --> 00:01:20,851
Can't you get that
through your thick skull?

8
00:01:22,293 --> 00:01:24,011
It got through that time.

9
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:26,568
- You'll be worse.
- Killing massa?

10
00:01:26,773 --> 00:01:30,925
- That's no more than killing a dog.
- No, damn it! No!

11
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,851
He's your daddy.

12
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:37,565
Don't know about you,
but I want to win and be champion.

13
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:39,405
If Speckled Red wins...

14
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:41,490
...I'll set you free.

15
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:46,651
The bird of Sir Eric Russell
is the winner!

16
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:51,885
Don't want no crying.
None of you all.

17
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:57,926
Your husband and your pappy
and I'm telling you now.

18
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:01,091
A few years. That's no time at all.

19
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:02,891
Be back.

20
00:02:03,093 --> 00:02:07,245
I'm married to a free man,
George Moore.

21
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,643
I ain't about to live
with no slave ever again.

22
00:02:11,893 --> 00:02:13,804
War, boys, it's war!

23
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:17,250
Are we gonna whup them Yankees?

24
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:20,561
I believe you want a whipping.

25
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,570
You won't do nothing...

26
00:02:22,773 --> 00:02:25,162
...because I won't let you, Brent.

27
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:28,166
Captain's brother has been missing.

28
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:31,012
If any of you seen him, speak up.

29
00:02:31,253 --> 00:02:34,928
You ain't seen the last of me, nigger.

30
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:51,569
"To all commanders in the field,
from General Robert E. Lee:

31
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:54,452
After four years of arduous service...

32
00:02:54,653 --> 00:02:58,202
...marked by unsurpassed courage
and fortitude...

33
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:01,325
...the Army has been
compelled to yield...

34
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:03,763
...to overwhelming resources.

35
00:03:03,973 --> 00:03:08,125
I need not tell the survivors
of many hard-fought battles...

36
00:03:08,493 --> 00:03:11,565
...who remained steadfast
to the last...

37
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:16,523
...that I have consented to this
result from no mistrust of them...

38
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:21,290
...but feeling that devotion
could accomplish nothing...

39
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:26,248
...that could compensate for the loss
that attends the continuance.

40
00:03:26,453 --> 00:03:30,605
I determined
to avoid the useless sacrifice...

41
00:03:30,773 --> 00:03:35,893
...of those whose past services have
endeared them to their countrymen.

42
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,283
You will take with you...

43
00:03:38,453 --> 00:03:41,445
...satisfaction coming
from consciousness...

44
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:44,167
...of duty faithfully performed.

45
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:49,963
And I earnestly pray that
a merciful God will extend you...

46
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:52,522
...his blessing and protection. "

47
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:57,363
It's over, folks. The war is over.

48
00:03:58,093 --> 00:04:00,448
God save the Confederacy.

49
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:24,805
Freedom. Freedom.

50
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:26,605
We's free!

51
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:28,445
Freedom!

52
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:30,566
Freedom!

53
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:34,005
Free! We's free!

54
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:37,604
Freedom! Freedom!

55
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:42,083
Hey, we're free! We're free!

56
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:44,281
Freedom!

57
00:04:45,613 --> 00:04:49,083
- Who that, Rufus?
- Lewis, from the Harvey place.

58
00:04:49,293 --> 00:04:52,683
- What was he bellowing?
- Something about freedom.

59
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:54,127
Free?

60
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:58,770
- Nigger must be crazy.
- Yeah, must be.

61
00:04:59,693 --> 00:05:01,809
Come on, mule. Come on!

62
00:05:09,053 --> 00:05:11,965
Lewis, what you standing around for?

63
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,971
We's free.

64
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:21,486
- Who say that?
- Came over the telegraph.

65
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:24,253
The war's over. The South gave up.

66
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:25,886
Slavery's no more!

67
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:29,409
- You be fooling with me, I'll...
- Not fooling you.

68
00:05:29,653 --> 00:05:33,089
I's here to tell you.
It is the God's truth.

69
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,931
Free?

70
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:11,132
- Mama?
- Yes?

71
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,485
Why you look so sad?
This is a celebration.

72
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:16,684
Thinking about your dad.

73
00:06:16,853 --> 00:06:19,048
Wishing he was here.

74
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:22,605
Don't fret. Chicken George
be coming back...

75
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:25,646
...now that freedom's come.

76
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:29,926
You come dance with me instead
of slaving at the table.

77
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:34,206
Come on, just one dance.

78
00:07:22,813 --> 00:07:26,931
I guess I don't have
to ask if you've heard the news.

79
00:07:30,013 --> 00:07:33,403
I don't know what it means,
what it'll do.

80
00:07:33,613 --> 00:07:35,843
I guess no one does right now.

81
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:40,242
I'll try to hold on to the farm.
I'm not sure how.

82
00:07:42,293 --> 00:07:44,966
You all may want
to go off on your own.

83
00:07:46,653 --> 00:07:50,612
But you can stay if you want.
I can't pay you anything.

84
00:07:50,773 --> 00:07:53,765
Everything I have is tied up
in the crops.

85
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:57,724
Maybe you could
farm some of the land...

86
00:07:57,933 --> 00:08:00,208
...and share the crop with me.

87
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:04,211
We all have to think about what to do.

88
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:09,329
I don't know what it means.

89
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:35,002
Say hello to your mom for me.

90
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:38,324
What'll it be, Harry?

91
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,372
Well, let's see now.

92
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,489
- I need...
- Mr. Brent.

93
00:08:44,093 --> 00:08:46,129
I been waiting a long time.

94
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:50,771
- I'll take care of you when I'm ready.
- I was here first.

95
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,882
Now look here, you no-account black.

96
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:03,325
It's all right, Evan.
I'll drop by a little later.

97
00:09:03,573 --> 00:09:05,404
No need for that now.

98
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:17,721
Well?

99
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:21,411
Loaf of bread and a bag of grits.

100
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,566
Thirty-six cents.

101
00:09:58,773 --> 00:10:00,126
Hello, Evan.

102
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:04,366
Senator! Doggone,
it's good to see you!

103
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:07,730
Like old times.
I thought you was in England.

104
00:10:07,893 --> 00:10:11,727
- I've just returned.
- Did you see that? Did you see?

105
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:14,527
You won't believe how they carry on.

106
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:18,726
Can't even call them niggers.
At least, not to their faces.

107
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,603
Well, I wouldn't fret, Evan.

108
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:24,043
Let the "niggras"...

109
00:10:24,693 --> 00:10:27,082
...have their day.
- What you mean?

110
00:10:27,613 --> 00:10:31,367
The same thing as old Uncle Richard
told me as a boy.

111
00:10:31,573 --> 00:10:35,885
Old Brer Rabbit, when he can't
get through one way...

112
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,567
...he change his way...

113
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:42,322
...and by and by,
he get where he want to be!

114
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:44,922
I get you now, sir! I get you!

115
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:49,043
That's right. We is free at last.

116
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:53,447
All right. We is free at last!

117
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,325
- Yeah! We's free!
- Free.

118
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:59,771
Ain't got no more massas.
Nobody going to whup us again.

119
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:02,282
Nobody gonna abuse our women.

120
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:03,522
No... .

121
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:05,052
That's right.

122
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:07,403
Freedom taste good, don't it?

123
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:09,649
- Yeah, I can taste it!
- Baby!

124
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:12,444
Well, maybe it taste good...

125
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:16,843
...but it sure ain't gonna
fill our bellies.

126
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:21,606
How is we gonna feed our children?

127
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:24,204
How we gonna find shelter?

128
00:11:24,453 --> 00:11:28,924
Now we is free,
what's we gonna do?

129
00:11:30,693 --> 00:11:33,730
I say we go
where the pickings is better.

130
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,730
Yeah, yeah.

131
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:40,213
Go where? Do what?

132
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:44,207
Well, I don't know right off.

133
00:11:44,893 --> 00:11:47,726
- Must be someplace.
- You is ignorant.

134
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:49,889
- Bone ignorant.
- Here now.

135
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:52,732
Ain't your fault, we's all ignorant.

136
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:57,125
We is just what
the massas wanted us to be.

137
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:01,724
None of us been taught to earn
our keep in the white man's world.

138
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:05,971
We gonna leave, we better learn...

139
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:08,892
...how to do for ourselves first.

140
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:14,121
Well, what you say, Tom?
What you say we do?

141
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:18,561
I say we stays here...

142
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:22,004
...and farms, like
we been doing all our lives.

143
00:12:22,213 --> 00:12:23,487
Not for Harvey.

144
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:27,487
It gonna be part
our own land for our own selves.

145
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:29,405
Our dirt we farms!

146
00:12:29,613 --> 00:12:33,572
Well, now, hold on a moment, Tom.
All I knows...

147
00:12:33,813 --> 00:12:36,771
...all I ever seen
is this plantation...

148
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:39,362
...and that little town of shops.

149
00:12:39,573 --> 00:12:41,882
I want to see the world, Tom.

150
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:44,926
What is freedom
if you can't go nowhere?

151
00:12:45,173 --> 00:12:47,403
Of course you can go.

152
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:51,371
That the whole idea of freedom.

153
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:57,963
You wants to wander for a while,
ain't nobody gonna stop you.

154
00:12:58,373 --> 00:12:59,965
Same for all of you.

155
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:03,251
But maybe we don't have to go.

156
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:08,131
Maybe now we can find
what we wants right here.

157
00:13:08,693 --> 00:13:11,605
I say we gotta give freedom a chance.

158
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:15,249
And here is as good a place
to start as any.

159
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:17,727
Besides...

160
00:13:20,773 --> 00:13:25,449
...what's our daddy gonna do
when he gets back and we's all gone?

161
00:13:26,413 --> 00:13:28,131
How we know he coming?

162
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:32,049
All them years he been gone,
and no word.

163
00:13:36,693 --> 00:13:40,368
He coming back because
he say he gonna come back.

164
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:45,043
Your dad ain't never
said nothing in his life...

165
00:13:45,253 --> 00:13:47,084
...he don't mean. Hear me?

166
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:48,726
Just asking, Mama.

167
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:53,130
I don't want to hear
no more about leaving.

168
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,769
Ain't nobody going nowhere
till my man come back.

169
00:13:57,813 --> 00:13:59,804
We is a family...

170
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:03,411
...and we is gonna stay a family.

171
00:14:21,853 --> 00:14:26,005
Tom? Martha and me sure would like
to throw our lot in with you.

172
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:28,204
If you wants us, of course.

173
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:30,081
Wants you?

174
00:14:31,693 --> 00:14:33,649
You just try getting away.

175
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:38,290
And you'll hear hounds baying
at your heels before long.

176
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:52,093
- Come with me.
- Where we going?

177
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,642
I's gonna spark you in moonlight.

178
00:14:55,613 --> 00:15:00,368
Yes, you is! That gonna be some
sparking with two young ones.

179
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,445
Don't argue with me. Just come along.

180
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:11,447
Damned if I'll give
my niggers any part of my farm.

181
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:14,929
It's been in my family
over a hundred years.

182
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:18,210
I'd as soon sell out
to some carpetbaggers.

183
00:15:18,413 --> 00:15:21,962
I'm with you. The niggers
is putting on enough airs...

184
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:23,925
...without owning land.

185
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:27,125
They can all own land,
far as I'm concerned.

186
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,291
- What you saying, Archie?
- Their graves.

187
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:33,092
They can own them all they want.

188
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:37,246
I respect your sentiments,
but we gotta be realistic.

189
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:41,492
Somebody has to work our land
and niggers are done as slaves.

190
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:44,890
I don't like it either,
but I got no cash for wages.

191
00:15:45,093 --> 00:15:47,129
I got to parcel out shares.

192
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:50,649
I'll never owe a black nothing
except a whipping.

193
00:15:50,853 --> 00:15:52,571
I always pay my debts.

194
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:55,088
You are living in the past.

195
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:57,813
You can't go around whipping blacks.

196
00:15:57,973 --> 00:15:59,611
Feds won't allow it.

197
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:01,804
He's talking sense, boys.

198
00:16:01,973 --> 00:16:05,602
There'll be a judge here,
and the Army'll back him up.

199
00:16:06,213 --> 00:16:10,365
We ought to string up a few of them.
Just to set an example.

200
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:12,132
Now you're talking.

201
00:16:12,653 --> 00:16:15,406
There's more minus than plus to that.

202
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:16,892
It sounds good...

203
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:19,966
I'll tell you about plus and minus.

204
00:16:20,173 --> 00:16:22,812
"Plus" is what
I come out of the war with.

205
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:26,769
I come out "plus"
a Yankee ball in my knee.

206
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:31,287
Come out "plus" a limp
I'll have the rest of my life.

207
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:35,571
And I'm "minus" my brother, sheriff.

208
00:16:37,373 --> 00:16:41,844
And I'm telling you
no white man killed him.

209
00:16:42,053 --> 00:16:46,126
No white man killed another in the
last month of war. Niggers did it!

210
00:16:51,213 --> 00:16:55,729
Every step I take,
every time my leg twinges on me...

211
00:16:55,893 --> 00:16:58,453
...I recollect who's responsible...

212
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:02,646
...for the "pluses" and "minuses"
I gotta live with now.

213
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:05,447
I recollect who done it to me.

214
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:07,928
Niggers!

215
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:18,289
Well, gentlemen,
I think I'd better leave now.

216
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:22,806
I'm bound to uphold the law.
Gave my solemn word to do that.

217
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:27,245
It seems to me that the law
ain't what this meeting is about.

218
00:17:27,453 --> 00:17:29,364
Just a minute, sheriff.

219
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:32,205
I'm going with you.

220
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:37,042
Senator.

221
00:17:38,293 --> 00:17:42,286
These men respect you,
and surely you're not for violence.

222
00:17:42,493 --> 00:17:46,611
I agree that misdirected violence
is dangerous, Mr. Jackson.

223
00:17:52,453 --> 00:17:55,411
What do you say?
We ain't heard from you.

224
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:57,769
What should we do, senator?

225
00:17:57,973 --> 00:18:02,763
It's my intention to acquire property.
A great deal of property.

226
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:07,725
If it was anybody but you,
I'd say you was plumb crazy.

227
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:11,721
The land ain't worth
a horse's apple without slaves.

228
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:15,727
Our niggra, under the misguided
new business arrangements...

229
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:19,010
...is to receive a share
of crops he works.

230
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:21,807
But before that profit is paid...

231
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:23,969
...his costs are deducted:

232
00:18:24,213 --> 00:18:27,967
Grain, tools, wagons,
mules, horses, feed.

233
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:32,530
Somehow he never manages
to catch up on the costs, right?

234
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:38,525
It doesn't matter who works land.
What counts is who owns it.

235
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:41,042
Property is power, always.

236
00:18:41,493 --> 00:18:44,053
Whoever has the land has the people.

237
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:47,012
I guess you know what you're doing.

238
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:48,362
Be assured I do.

239
00:18:48,773 --> 00:18:53,210
By and by, Brer Rabbit,
he gonna get where he want to be.

240
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:02,571
Tom! Tom!

241
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:06,602
Where've you been with the water?

242
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:08,809
We got some thirsty mouths.

243
00:19:09,653 --> 00:19:11,883
- Tom!
- Reeny?

244
00:19:14,293 --> 00:19:17,569
What? What is it? What?

245
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:20,452
Rufus just came in from town.

246
00:19:20,853 --> 00:19:22,081
Telegraph say...

247
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:26,047
...a white man killed
President Lincoln last night.

248
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:29,767
Shot him in the back of the head.

249
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:32,086
He's dead, Tom.

250
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:43,371
Still daylight left to work.

251
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:52,049
Did you hear her, Tom?

252
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:58,049
- Lincoln's dead!
- I heard. I know he's dead.

253
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:01,489
It won't be for nothing!

254
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:04,770
I won't let his dying be for nothing!

255
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:49,527
Tom? What is it?

256
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:06,332
To your cabins, everybody. Quick!

257
00:22:33,173 --> 00:22:35,164
- Tom?
- I don't know.

258
00:23:35,813 --> 00:23:38,168
You keep out of this, Harvey!

259
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:25,126
Lewis! Tom! Come on, come on!

260
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:28,609
Let's get a line here.
Get some water on this!

261
00:24:28,813 --> 00:24:32,203
Jesse, come on, come on!
Everybody! Hannah!

262
00:24:32,413 --> 00:24:34,244
The barn's on fire!

263
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:38,082
- Everybody move.
- Come on. Hurry up!

264
00:24:38,293 --> 00:24:40,170
Pass the bucket. Pass it.

265
00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:42,489
Move it, move it, everybody.

266
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:45,042
Buckets! It's getting bigger!

267
00:24:45,253 --> 00:24:47,005
Hurry, before it spreads!

268
00:24:49,973 --> 00:24:52,771
Get the bucket! Back! Get back!

269
00:24:58,253 --> 00:25:00,767
- Back! Watch out!
- Faster, faster!

270
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:17,644
Free at last.

271
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:26,409
I don't understand it.
I just don't understand it.

272
00:25:34,853 --> 00:25:37,492
We won't let them get away with this.

273
00:25:37,653 --> 00:25:40,531
We worked too hard to raise our crops.

274
00:25:40,693 --> 00:25:43,446
Nobody gonna ride
in here and trample...

275
00:25:43,653 --> 00:25:46,167
...everything we got in the world.

276
00:25:47,093 --> 00:25:49,846
We ought to get guns and fight back.

277
00:25:50,213 --> 00:25:52,044
Who we gonna fight?

278
00:25:52,413 --> 00:25:54,688
Damn! I don't know.

279
00:25:55,573 --> 00:25:57,962
We can't let them do this.

280
00:25:58,133 --> 00:26:01,011
They won't let us live here.
We should get out!

281
00:26:01,213 --> 00:26:05,604
No! We ain't gonna do no such thing.

282
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:09,362
We's staying because
we has a right to stay.

283
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:11,446
This changes nothing.

284
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:15,885
It means there's some rebs around
don't know the war is over.

285
00:26:16,093 --> 00:26:18,561
They won't push us off our land.

286
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:20,286
We is free men.

287
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:29,166
Besides...

288
00:26:30,453 --> 00:26:33,763
...they won't get away with it.
- What you mean?

289
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:35,247
Look here.

290
00:26:36,693 --> 00:26:39,765
- I don't see nothing but hoofmarks.
- Right.

291
00:26:40,053 --> 00:26:42,487
- What's so special then?
- Nothing.

292
00:26:42,693 --> 00:26:46,163
Hoofmarks are all the same.
But suppose they weren't?

293
00:26:47,213 --> 00:26:49,886
Suppose each hoofmark had something...

294
00:26:50,093 --> 00:26:51,685
...that set it apart.

295
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:56,372
- What you getting at, Tom?
- Those nightriders, that's what.

296
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:01,971
Stands to reason...

297
00:27:02,173 --> 00:27:05,131
...these riders
is some of our neighbors.

298
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:09,724
Also, most of them bring
their horses to me for shoeing.

299
00:27:09,973 --> 00:27:14,763
Now suppose every horse
I shoes me from this day on...

300
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:17,971
...I put a little special mark on it.

301
00:27:18,613 --> 00:27:19,887
Maybe here.

302
00:27:23,413 --> 00:27:27,929
Then we'd have a way of knowing
what horse the shoe belong to.

303
00:27:29,693 --> 00:27:33,163
And if we know where the shoe fits... .

304
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,085
Why are you selling?

305
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:52,251
The place got run down during the war.

306
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:55,445
I parceled shares to the niggras...

307
00:27:55,653 --> 00:27:57,405
...but nightriders came.

308
00:27:57,973 --> 00:27:59,645
You don't know who?

309
00:27:59,853 --> 00:28:04,449
No. They've been rampaging through
the country, destroying crops...

310
00:28:04,653 --> 00:28:06,883
...scaring the niggras half to death.

311
00:28:07,093 --> 00:28:10,403
Last week they tore up
everything I planted.

312
00:28:10,613 --> 00:28:13,923
I don't have the heart
for farming anymore, senator.

313
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:18,251
I'm sorry to hear about
your troubles, Samuel. Very sorry.

314
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:21,493
But business is business.

315
00:28:21,773 --> 00:28:26,449
In anticipation of our discussion,
I had this contract drawn up.

316
00:28:35,373 --> 00:28:39,082
$5000 isn't much
for a man's life work, senator.

317
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:41,973
I couldn't agree with you more.

318
00:28:42,453 --> 00:28:46,207
Unhappily, that's quite
beside the point.

319
00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:51,928
You've indicated that the place
isn't in the best of condition.

320
00:28:52,253 --> 00:28:56,041
And in all good faith, 5000...

321
00:28:56,253 --> 00:28:58,289
...is the best I can manage.

322
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:04,729
Think about it. You might wait
for a more satisfactory offer.

323
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:08,243
We both know there won't
be any better offers.

324
00:29:08,693 --> 00:29:10,331
I'll accept.

325
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:31,046
Good. That's it, then.

326
00:29:32,453 --> 00:29:34,523
There's just one other thing.

327
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:38,806
My niggras owe me for seed.
A couple hundred dollars.

328
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:42,449
They've worked hard.
I wanna wipe the slate clean.

329
00:29:42,653 --> 00:29:46,248
- Consider it done. Here's my hand.
- Thank you.

330
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:49,323
Ain't you done yet, boy?

331
00:29:49,933 --> 00:29:53,289
Yes, sir, Mr. Drake. I's trying, sir.

332
00:29:54,933 --> 00:29:56,651
Got to fix it just right.

333
00:30:17,813 --> 00:30:20,805
I guess that's about it.
Much obliged, boys.

334
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:27,092
Lila.

335
00:30:28,533 --> 00:30:30,410
It's time, Lila.

336
00:30:32,973 --> 00:30:34,406
Lila... .

337
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:38,762
Oh, Sam, how can we? All those years.

338
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:41,891
I know, honey.
There's nothing we can do.

339
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:11,532
I'm gonna miss this place,
and you folks.

340
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:16,566
I'm sorry I had to sell,
but I didn't have much choice.

341
00:31:17,653 --> 00:31:20,963
The new owner will come
in a few days to talk to you.

342
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:24,722
Meantime, I suggest you put
in your new crops.

343
00:31:26,973 --> 00:31:30,966
I'm sure you'll find Senator Justin
a decent man to work for.

344
00:31:31,413 --> 00:31:35,406
He agreed to wipe out your debts
so you can start from fresh.

345
00:31:49,933 --> 00:31:53,482
Mrs. Harvey and I want to thank you
for your kindness...

346
00:31:53,693 --> 00:31:55,809
...and your help over the years.

347
00:31:58,613 --> 00:32:00,763
Goodbye and good luck to you.

348
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:06,603
Goodbye, Mr. Harvey.

349
00:32:07,213 --> 00:32:09,124
Mrs. Harvey.

350
00:32:11,733 --> 00:32:14,247
Now, what's the matter with y'all?

351
00:32:14,813 --> 00:32:16,690
Where's your manners?

352
00:32:17,613 --> 00:32:20,685
Say goodbye to the Harveys
and wish them well.

353
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:24,206
- Bye, Massa Harvey.
- Bye, massa.

354
00:32:24,373 --> 00:32:27,251
- Bye, Massa Harvey.
- Bye, Massa Harvey.

355
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:35,406
You was better than some, massa.

356
00:33:20,253 --> 00:33:24,041
Now that we know who they is,
I say let's kill them!

357
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:25,441
No.

358
00:33:25,653 --> 00:33:29,726
Why not? I didn't know you was
particular about killing whites.

359
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:35,887
There will be no killing.
We go to the law.

360
00:33:36,053 --> 00:33:37,281
White man's law?

361
00:33:38,773 --> 00:33:39,922
That's right.

362
00:33:41,973 --> 00:33:45,249
Sorry I'm late. I had
to help Martha with some chores.

363
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:49,762
- What we got to do...
- What's that white man doing here?

364
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:53,048
What white man?

365
00:33:53,253 --> 00:33:56,529
They's only one white man
in here as I can see.

366
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,170
Old George?

367
00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:07,524
When the killing starts,
like holds to like.

368
00:34:07,733 --> 00:34:11,965
You got no call to talk like that.
He can't help it he white.

369
00:34:12,413 --> 00:34:14,404
I don't care. I want him out.

370
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:18,083
And who is you to
be giving orders around here?

371
00:34:18,533 --> 00:34:21,093
I ain't the only one
that feels that way!

372
00:34:27,093 --> 00:34:31,405
I ain't listening to nobody
say a word against Old George!

373
00:34:31,573 --> 00:34:33,529
No, Tom, it's all right.

374
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:38,288
I ain't one to tarry
where I ain't wanted.

375
00:34:40,613 --> 00:34:42,171
Old George...?

376
00:34:45,493 --> 00:34:48,690
Now I say we ain't going to no law!

377
00:34:48,973 --> 00:34:51,885
I say we even up our own tally!

378
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:57,248
Lewis, you best sit down and shut your
mouth. You said enough for one day.

379
00:34:57,613 --> 00:35:00,844
You're lucky that Mama
weren't here to hear you.

380
00:35:04,413 --> 00:35:09,533
I said, sit down, little brother.

381
00:35:16,773 --> 00:35:19,606
I ain't finished with you
about Old George.

382
00:35:23,293 --> 00:35:25,932
We gots to go to the law,
don't you see?

383
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:29,651
Ain't supposed to be
no white man's law.

384
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:32,408
Only supposed to be one law.

385
00:35:32,813 --> 00:35:35,566
- The law!
- You daft, Tom?

386
00:35:37,653 --> 00:35:41,362
You try to set the law on whites,
they gonna lynch you.

387
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:45,691
Maybe, maybe not.
But we got to find out, don't we?

388
00:35:46,493 --> 00:35:50,645
If we don't give the law a chance,
freedom ain't worth a damn!

389
00:36:00,053 --> 00:36:03,170
Who going into town with me
to see the sheriff?

390
00:36:42,173 --> 00:36:46,007
You is a plumb stubborn fool.

391
00:36:47,893 --> 00:36:51,568
- Damn you!
- What are you so all fired up about?

392
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:56,923
Why you got to be the one to step
forward? You ain't even the oldest.

393
00:36:57,253 --> 00:37:00,370
Why you got to be
the big man every time?

394
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:09,326
'Cause I wants to look my daddy
in the eye when next we meet.

395
00:37:10,453 --> 00:37:14,366
'Cause I want our children
growing up in freedom.

396
00:37:15,253 --> 00:37:19,849
'Cause too many suffered
to bring us this far to go back.

397
00:37:21,653 --> 00:37:24,531
'Cause somebody got
to stand up, Irene.

398
00:37:24,733 --> 00:37:26,451
Is that so?

399
00:37:28,773 --> 00:37:32,083
Well, somebody got to mind
his wife and babies too.

400
00:37:33,493 --> 00:37:38,089
Now who gonna do that after
they shoots you or hangs you up?

401
00:37:38,293 --> 00:37:40,204
- Irene...
- Oh!

402
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:43,329
- Don't go!
- Irene.

403
00:37:44,693 --> 00:37:48,208
- Oh, please. Please.
- I gots to.

404
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:55,123
Oh, Tom. I'm so scared.

405
00:37:56,053 --> 00:38:00,968
Tom... . I don't want them
to hurt you.

406
00:38:02,973 --> 00:38:05,407
I ain't nothing without you, Tom.

407
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:10,728
I's scared too...

408
00:38:11,293 --> 00:38:15,366
...but I just can't not go.

409
00:38:22,453 --> 00:38:25,092
I hate you for doing this.

410
00:38:27,413 --> 00:38:32,203
I'd give anything, say anything,
do anything to make you stay.

411
00:38:40,893 --> 00:38:43,566
But I's proud of you, Tom Harvey.

412
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:49,248
Oh, I's terrible proud of you.

413
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,642
- Now... .
- What?

414
00:39:07,133 --> 00:39:09,852
There's only one thing.

415
00:39:10,053 --> 00:39:12,362
I am going with you.

416
00:39:12,573 --> 00:39:15,406
- You's talking crazy...
- I'm going.

417
00:39:15,613 --> 00:39:20,050
- Woman, you is...
- Yes, Tom?

418
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,842
One fine woman.

419
00:39:31,893 --> 00:39:33,849
That's what you is.

420
00:39:35,413 --> 00:39:37,768
You's one fine woman.

421
00:39:54,773 --> 00:39:56,843
Well, well, well.

422
00:39:59,093 --> 00:40:01,812
You are one smart man, Tom Harvey.

423
00:40:04,373 --> 00:40:07,092
Fancy you figuring out
something like this.

424
00:40:09,813 --> 00:40:11,929
There's no doubt about it.

425
00:40:12,773 --> 00:40:17,130
You got them dead to rights.
You did good coming to me, though.

426
00:40:20,093 --> 00:40:23,085
Had you told anybody else about this?

427
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:24,971
Just my kin.

428
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:30,283
What you gonna do, sheriff?

429
00:40:30,453 --> 00:40:35,322
I'm gonna get after them, Tom,
but I gotta handle this careful.

430
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:39,412
This is not just locking up
some Saturday night drunk.

431
00:40:40,493 --> 00:40:44,930
I gotta study. I got to figure out
how to handle this.

432
00:40:53,693 --> 00:40:56,287
I tell you what I want you to do.

433
00:40:58,573 --> 00:41:02,486
You go on home and just go on
about your business.

434
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:06,527
Best that folks don't know you got
anything to do with this.

435
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:09,770
Yes, sir. Take care of it, then?

436
00:41:12,093 --> 00:41:16,848
Well, I guess I got to, Tom.
I guess I got to.

437
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:35,721
- Tom?
- I think we done right.

438
00:41:36,773 --> 00:41:41,483
- I think the law is the law.
- What happened?

439
00:41:41,653 --> 00:41:44,850
He heard me out,
and he going after them.

440
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:47,811
What you two doing here?

441
00:41:49,613 --> 00:41:53,845
Well, you one crazy fool.

442
00:41:54,453 --> 00:41:56,330
But you still our brother.

443
00:41:56,533 --> 00:42:00,128
- You sure?
- He going after them. Don't worry.

444
00:42:14,213 --> 00:42:15,566
Yeah?

445
00:42:20,213 --> 00:42:21,885
Can I come in?

446
00:42:22,613 --> 00:42:23,887
Sure.

447
00:42:31,373 --> 00:42:32,931
You all right?

448
00:42:36,493 --> 00:42:40,566
I sorry about what happened.
You knows how we feel about you.

449
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:44,762
Yeah, I guess I do.
After last night, I guess I do.

450
00:42:44,973 --> 00:42:49,012
Don't go on like that. Lewis got
no more sense than a bee...

451
00:42:49,173 --> 00:42:50,891
...when his blood's up.

452
00:42:51,093 --> 00:42:52,321
Don't mean nothing.

453
00:42:52,533 --> 00:42:56,208
If Lewis didn't mean what he said,
why ain't he here?

454
00:42:56,453 --> 00:43:01,129
He come around. He just needs
more time to collect himself.

455
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:04,526
Well, Tom.

456
00:43:05,133 --> 00:43:07,647
I guess maybe I need some time too.

457
00:43:07,853 --> 00:43:09,809
Well, sure you do.

458
00:43:22,813 --> 00:43:26,123
- George?
- What?

459
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:29,241
Maybe we been here long enough.

460
00:43:30,253 --> 00:43:34,007
Maybe we best be thinking
of striking out for ourselves...

461
00:43:34,533 --> 00:43:36,808
...while we still young enough.

462
00:43:40,053 --> 00:43:43,204
I'm sure you've been concerned
about what'll happen...

463
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:46,086
...now that Mr. Harvey has left.

464
00:43:46,453 --> 00:43:49,923
Let me reassure you
that nothing is going to change.

465
00:43:50,133 --> 00:43:53,284
Mr. Harvey's agreement with you
will be honored.

466
00:43:53,493 --> 00:43:56,803
You'll receive a percentage
of the crops you raise.

467
00:43:57,333 --> 00:44:00,325
Well, what do you say to that?

468
00:44:00,533 --> 00:44:02,763
It's very kind of you, sir.

469
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:08,047
But if Mr. Brent gonna be in charge,
I don't think my people wanna stay on.

470
00:44:11,453 --> 00:44:12,966
Well.

471
00:44:13,493 --> 00:44:16,724
You're free to go, of course.

472
00:44:17,413 --> 00:44:20,644
Just as soon as you pay up your debt.

473
00:44:20,853 --> 00:44:22,286
What debt?

474
00:44:24,173 --> 00:44:27,449
According to the farm's ledger,
you was advanced $235...

475
00:44:27,653 --> 00:44:31,009
...in seed, grain and supplies
against future crops.

476
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:35,923
But Mr. Harvey said he fixed that.
Told us we was free and clear.

477
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:40,246
The agreement's on file
at the county clerk's office.

478
00:44:40,453 --> 00:44:43,126
I didn't see
that in the deed of sale.

479
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:51,007
Now you work hard on your share,
it'll reduce your debt considerably.

480
00:44:51,253 --> 00:44:53,972
$235 dollars ain't all that much.

481
00:44:54,373 --> 00:44:58,332
But in the meantime,
don't nobody try leaving here.

482
00:44:58,533 --> 00:45:02,082
This is a legal matter
and the sheriff will lock you up.

483
00:45:03,053 --> 00:45:04,805
Senator, sir?

484
00:45:05,813 --> 00:45:08,691
Is this what you wants?

485
00:45:08,853 --> 00:45:11,321
I thought I made it clear, boy.

486
00:45:12,053 --> 00:45:14,248
Mr. Brent speaks for me.

487
00:45:17,813 --> 00:45:19,849
Mr. Johnson.

488
00:45:20,053 --> 00:45:24,251
We're wondering what your plans are,
now that Mr. Harvey's left.

489
00:45:24,453 --> 00:45:28,651
I ain't got no special plans.
I'll just go on working my share.

490
00:45:28,853 --> 00:45:32,163
That won't do. Me and the senator,
we got feelings...

491
00:45:32,373 --> 00:45:35,683
...about whites sharecropping
with niggers.

492
00:45:36,053 --> 00:45:39,409
Why should a smart boy
wanna work like a field hand...

493
00:45:39,613 --> 00:45:42,810
...when there are
other opportunities to consider?

494
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:48,407
We need someone to keep his eye on
things, make sure the work gets done.

495
00:45:48,693 --> 00:45:50,923
The job's yours if you want it.

496
00:45:51,093 --> 00:45:53,732
I ain't much about overseeing.

497
00:45:53,933 --> 00:45:58,131
I'll pay you a good wage and if
it works out, maybe your family...

498
00:45:58,333 --> 00:46:03,123
...can move into the main house here.
Now that's fair, ain't it?

499
00:46:12,893 --> 00:46:17,648
- All right. I'll do it.
- Good boy, Georgie. Good boy.

500
00:46:18,933 --> 00:46:22,050
We'll settle the details later.
Senator?

501
00:46:22,253 --> 00:46:24,721
I think that's everything
for now, Evan.

502
00:46:24,933 --> 00:46:28,403
I'm looking forward to a long
and happy association.

503
00:46:28,613 --> 00:46:30,968
You'll find me a fair man
to work for...

504
00:46:31,493 --> 00:46:34,929
...if you're willing
to meet me halfway.

505
00:46:38,013 --> 00:46:41,722
Next time I'm here,
I expect to see all these darkies...

506
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:44,367
...out in the fields
where they belong.

507
00:46:44,693 --> 00:46:47,161
I want you reporting to me regular.

508
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:56,609
I do hope you're gonna
behave yourself, boy.

509
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,804
I surely do.

510
00:47:13,973 --> 00:47:16,203
Oh, howdy, sheriff. Come on in.

511
00:47:16,373 --> 00:47:17,806
Howdy, Evan.

512
00:47:25,173 --> 00:47:29,132
You know, Evan, we've been friends
for a long time.

513
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,244
I want you to know that.

514
00:47:32,213 --> 00:47:35,250
I know that, Charlie.
What's got into you?

515
00:47:35,413 --> 00:47:38,769
And I'm on your side.

516
00:47:39,133 --> 00:47:41,249
You understand that, don't you?

517
00:47:41,813 --> 00:47:43,883
Sheriff, you been drinking?

518
00:47:44,693 --> 00:47:48,049
No, I don't think
I could get drunk tonight.

519
00:47:48,213 --> 00:47:51,046
No. Why? Why can't you get drunk?

520
00:47:52,053 --> 00:47:55,728
I know who every single one
of them nightriders is.

521
00:47:55,933 --> 00:48:00,529
I got proof I'm gonna turn over
to the Federal Circuit Court judge...

522
00:48:00,693 --> 00:48:03,332
...when he comes next weekend.
- You got what?

523
00:48:03,893 --> 00:48:08,444
You heard me, Evan. I got proof.
Tom Harvey gave it to me.

524
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:13,044
I don't want to know what I know.
But I know it for a real fact...

525
00:48:13,253 --> 00:48:16,051
...unless somebody does something.

526
00:48:16,213 --> 00:48:20,604
I'm sworn to do something that'll
make me a hated man in this county.

527
00:48:21,053 --> 00:48:26,081
Unless somebody does something to make
Tom Harvey pull back his evidence.

528
00:48:26,293 --> 00:48:27,851
Do something like what?

529
00:48:28,053 --> 00:48:32,888
Evan, I'm sick enough as it is!
At myself, for letting it go this far.

530
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:35,561
Do I have to lay out the plan too?

531
00:48:36,373 --> 00:48:39,570
No. No need for that.

532
00:48:40,053 --> 00:48:43,728
You've done enough, sheriff.
You've done enough.

533
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,243
I guess I'll just have to see...

534
00:48:55,453 --> 00:48:58,013
I don't wanna know another word.

535
00:48:59,893 --> 00:49:04,648
I'm an officer of the law.
Sometimes an officer of the law...

536
00:49:04,853 --> 00:49:09,643
...just ain't got no choice in some
things. You understand what I mean?

537
00:49:12,173 --> 00:49:16,246
Won't nobody misunderstand, sheriff.
I'll see to that.

538
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:24,292
Well, thank you, Evan.
I'm much obliged to you.

539
00:49:27,653 --> 00:49:29,132
Good night, Evan.

540
00:50:35,053 --> 00:50:36,850
Tom Harvey!

541
00:50:40,693 --> 00:50:42,649
We want you, nigger!

542
00:50:46,533 --> 00:50:49,411
Tom. Tom!

543
00:50:57,213 --> 00:51:02,128
Get yourself out here, boy.
Or we're gonna burn your kinfolk.

544
00:51:03,733 --> 00:51:05,291
Tom.

545
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:37,402
Move.

546
00:51:41,133 --> 00:51:42,851
Now!

547
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:22,002
George.

548
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:24,971
They's six of them, Martha. Six!

549
00:52:26,413 --> 00:52:31,441
Why should I? Like holds to like.
That's what they told me, ain't it?

550
00:52:31,733 --> 00:52:33,086
Ain't it?

551
00:52:38,773 --> 00:52:42,402
Thought you was smart going
to the sheriff, didn't you?

552
00:52:45,773 --> 00:52:48,367
This here's a bad nigger!

553
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:53,653
Talking about the law instead of
doing his work, paying his debts.

554
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:58,121
So we're gonna teach him
how to be a good nigger!

555
00:52:58,293 --> 00:53:03,321
It's best you study hard what's gonna
happen, so you won't make mistakes.

556
00:53:03,533 --> 00:53:07,003
Because you ain't never
gonna leave here! Never!

557
00:53:07,213 --> 00:53:09,363
All right! Get on with it!

558
00:53:24,573 --> 00:53:27,167
Damn it! Now you leave my nigger be!

559
00:53:27,373 --> 00:53:30,092
Stay out of this.
Boy needs a lesson.

560
00:53:30,293 --> 00:53:33,649
- What's he done?
- He's fixing to set the law on us.

561
00:53:37,053 --> 00:53:39,089
All right, he's got it coming!

562
00:53:39,253 --> 00:53:43,929
But you put me in charge here
and nobody whips my niggers but me!

563
00:53:47,973 --> 00:53:49,452
Let him do it.

564
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:29,005
- Why you stopping?
- No use. He's senseless!

565
00:54:29,493 --> 00:54:33,168
It don't matter.
He'll remember when he wakes up.

566
00:54:33,373 --> 00:54:36,570
If he wakes up. Now get on with it.

567
00:54:47,893 --> 00:54:50,407
Looks like you're on top of that!

568
00:54:50,613 --> 00:54:53,764
Make sure you teach him
how to be a nigger now!

569
00:55:18,413 --> 00:55:22,645
- Tom! Tom!
- God, let him be alive!

570
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:27,563
Oh, God, let him be alive!
Please. Help him.

571
00:55:27,733 --> 00:55:29,849
Let him be alive.

572
00:55:40,533 --> 00:55:44,890
Irene? Irene. I'm sorry, Irene.
I was just trying...

573
00:55:45,413 --> 00:55:48,371
...to make them think
I was doing their job.

574
00:55:49,213 --> 00:55:53,286
You ain't got nothing to be
sorry about, Old George Johnson.

575
00:55:53,853 --> 00:55:56,208
You just saved my man's life!

576
00:55:56,773 --> 00:55:58,923
You just saved my man's life.

577
00:55:59,893 --> 00:56:04,921
I'm sorry, Old George.
I was wrong. Dead wrong.

578
00:56:09,173 --> 00:56:12,051
- Let's get him inside.
- He'll be all right.

579
00:56:12,853 --> 00:56:15,162
- He's gonna be all right.
- Easy.

580
00:56:15,573 --> 00:56:18,770
- Careful now. Be careful.
- Easy.

581
00:56:18,973 --> 00:56:20,691
Oh, Tom.

582
00:56:25,413 --> 00:56:29,645
What we gonna do? What we gonna do?

583
00:56:29,813 --> 00:56:31,610
Ain't nothing we can do.

584
00:56:31,813 --> 00:56:35,567
We ain't never gonna get away
from here. Never!

585
00:56:35,773 --> 00:56:37,968
At least not alive, anyway.

586
00:56:38,773 --> 00:56:40,047
All my fault.

587
00:56:41,333 --> 00:56:44,211
I should've let y'all go
when you wanted.

588
00:56:44,533 --> 00:56:47,206
- Instead of...
- Now you just hush, Mama.

589
00:56:47,413 --> 00:56:52,168
Don't you go blaming yourself.
We stayed here because we wanted to.

590
00:56:52,373 --> 00:56:55,763
Tom? What we gonna do?

591
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,682
Get my boy out of here.

592
00:57:06,493 --> 00:57:09,087
I don't want him to see me like this.

593
00:57:10,613 --> 00:57:12,046
Martha.

594
00:57:19,053 --> 00:57:20,452
Lewis?

595
00:57:21,573 --> 00:57:22,608
Yeah, Tom?

596
00:57:24,493 --> 00:57:28,486
Take that shovel
and dig up the floor...

597
00:57:28,693 --> 00:57:30,285
...under Bud's bed.

598
00:57:31,133 --> 00:57:34,170
- What you want me to do that for?
- Do it!

599
00:57:44,813 --> 00:57:48,647
Bud, don't worry about your daddy.
He's gonna be fine.

600
00:57:50,093 --> 00:57:52,209
He's a strong man.

601
00:57:52,373 --> 00:57:54,648
Ain't none stronger.

602
00:57:55,493 --> 00:57:58,565
He'll be up and around in no time.

603
00:57:58,773 --> 00:58:01,731
I'm gonna kill
those white men someday.

604
00:58:07,373 --> 00:58:10,729
- You shouldn't talk like that.
- I'm gonna kill them.

605
00:58:12,373 --> 00:58:15,729
Bible says it ain't right
to kill people, Bud.

606
00:58:15,893 --> 00:58:19,090
Do it say it right
for them to whip my daddy?

607
00:58:23,573 --> 00:58:25,803
It don't say that neither.

608
00:58:26,293 --> 00:58:28,523
Then I'm bound to get them.

609
00:58:32,853 --> 00:58:36,846
Which ones, Bud?
Couldn't see their faces.

610
00:58:37,053 --> 00:58:39,931
I'll find a way
to get the ones who done it.

611
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:44,528
Suppose you make a mistake?

612
00:58:44,973 --> 00:58:48,966
Suppose you hurt white folks
that ain't done your daddy no harm?

613
00:58:49,173 --> 00:58:50,970
I'll do what I gotta do.

614
00:58:55,773 --> 00:58:59,129
Then I guess you might as well
start with me.

615
00:58:59,893 --> 00:59:01,690
I didn't mean you.

616
00:59:02,933 --> 00:59:05,128
Well, I sure am white.

617
00:59:06,133 --> 00:59:08,488
I'm white as a cotton ball.

618
00:59:09,893 --> 00:59:12,532
If you start hurting whites
for being white...

619
00:59:12,733 --> 00:59:15,486
...then soon you'll get
to me and Old George.

620
00:59:15,853 --> 00:59:17,252
I don't wanna kill you.

621
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:21,492
That's what happens when you
hurt folks for their skin color.

622
00:59:22,373 --> 00:59:25,251
You won't be any better than them.

623
00:59:25,453 --> 00:59:27,364
I hate them. Hate them!

624
00:59:27,973 --> 00:59:31,488
Hate them for what they done...

625
00:59:32,093 --> 00:59:34,732
...not because they's white.

626
00:59:36,893 --> 00:59:39,088
Me and mine is white.

627
00:59:40,213 --> 00:59:42,169
But we love you...

628
00:59:42,373 --> 00:59:44,284
...just like our own.

629
00:59:47,413 --> 00:59:49,608
If you'll let us love you.

630
00:59:54,293 --> 00:59:55,726
Oh, Bud.

631
00:59:57,973 --> 01:00:00,407
Oh, my poor little Bud.

632
01:00:19,773 --> 01:00:22,048
This is a cavalry officer's pistol.

633
01:00:25,373 --> 01:00:28,092
Got "J.B. " carved in the handle here.

634
01:00:28,493 --> 01:00:30,165
Lord God!

635
01:00:30,413 --> 01:00:34,565
- It be Jemmy Brent's. Put it away.
- Give it to me.

636
01:00:35,493 --> 01:00:38,087
Husband, what is you thinking of?

637
01:00:38,293 --> 01:00:41,968
They catch you with that gun,
they gonna kill you.

638
01:00:42,533 --> 01:00:44,888
I only knows one thing:

639
01:00:45,973 --> 01:00:49,090
Ain't nobody ever gonna whip me again!

640
01:00:50,093 --> 01:00:51,492
Ever!

641
01:00:52,213 --> 01:00:53,328
Someone's coming!

642
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:59,528
Blow out the candles.

643
01:01:18,293 --> 01:01:22,491
Open the door slow, whoever you is...

644
01:01:22,813 --> 01:01:25,008
...or I'll blows you apart.

645
01:01:34,773 --> 01:01:36,729
You don't wanna do that, son.

646
01:01:36,933 --> 01:01:40,164
Not unless you gonna make yourself
an orphan child.

647
01:01:41,053 --> 01:01:42,168
Daddy?

648
01:01:45,773 --> 01:01:47,570
My man.

649
01:01:48,173 --> 01:01:49,208
Grandpa.

650
01:01:49,413 --> 01:01:50,971
Chicken George!

651
01:01:56,933 --> 01:01:58,286
What's this?

652
01:01:59,213 --> 01:02:01,010
I got news for you.

653
01:02:01,173 --> 01:02:04,085
The old chicken-fighter
has come home to roost!

654
01:02:04,573 --> 01:02:06,245
Look at you.

655
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:12,408
Good thing you come home
after dark, George.

656
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:13,802
Why you say that?

657
01:02:13,973 --> 01:02:19,093
I's so old and ugly I might scare you
to death in God's proper light.

658
01:02:20,533 --> 01:02:23,286
I don't see you with my eyes...

659
01:02:23,493 --> 01:02:26,053
...I sees you with my heart.

660
01:02:26,253 --> 01:02:29,643
- So I is old and ugly?
- What you talking about?

661
01:02:29,853 --> 01:02:33,641
Was a time when you used to
look at me with your eyes.

662
01:02:34,453 --> 01:02:38,048
All right, I'll look at you now.
Come on.

663
01:02:38,253 --> 01:02:40,483
I say come on around here.

664
01:02:45,533 --> 01:02:48,809
You still is beautiful, Tildy.

665
01:02:51,253 --> 01:02:54,131
You still my beautiful woman.

666
01:02:55,613 --> 01:02:58,730
Sure, time has left a few tracks
in its passing...

667
01:02:58,933 --> 01:03:00,810
...like it's done me.

668
01:03:01,213 --> 01:03:05,729
But you got a sprinkling
of moonbeam in your hair. Look.

669
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,251
And your eyes... .

670
01:03:10,493 --> 01:03:14,771
Your eyes still have that
little girl looking out of them.

671
01:03:14,973 --> 01:03:18,807
I feel like
a little girl tonight, George.

672
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:21,005
Been so long.

673
01:03:21,173 --> 01:03:24,131
It's just like the very first time.

674
01:03:34,293 --> 01:03:36,204
What's going on here?

675
01:03:37,493 --> 01:03:40,610
Tom whipped, and this
Evan Brent in charge.

676
01:03:40,813 --> 01:03:44,692
Nothing that won't keep till morning.
Hush now.

677
01:03:45,853 --> 01:03:50,085
Brent and his like done stole
most our lives away.

678
01:03:50,653 --> 01:03:53,850
Let's keep this one night
for ourselves.

679
01:03:54,053 --> 01:03:56,851
Oh, my sweet, sweet Mama.

680
01:04:07,413 --> 01:04:12,328
Yes, indeed. The family sure owes
a lot to these two birds.

681
01:04:12,533 --> 01:04:16,731
With the money they won me,
I bought us some land in Tennessee.

682
01:04:16,933 --> 01:04:19,527
Land so rich and black
you can plant...

683
01:04:19,733 --> 01:04:22,805
...a pig's tail and a hog will grow!

684
01:04:23,413 --> 01:04:24,687
Daddy...

685
01:04:25,173 --> 01:04:27,926
...ain't you heard a word we said?

686
01:04:28,933 --> 01:04:32,403
We can't go to Tennessee,
can't go nowhere.

687
01:04:33,733 --> 01:04:35,724
You mean Brent and his bunch?

688
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,403
I wouldn't worry about that none.

689
01:04:41,533 --> 01:04:44,366
I been in worse situations in the war.

690
01:04:47,253 --> 01:04:49,244
What you getting at?

691
01:04:51,853 --> 01:04:53,002
All right.

692
01:04:54,213 --> 01:04:57,649
Let's look at it
like it was a military operation.

693
01:04:58,133 --> 01:05:01,205
Here we are,
surrounded by the enemy...

694
01:05:01,413 --> 01:05:03,722
...outnumbered, outgunned...

695
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:06,811
...and half our troops
is women and children.

696
01:05:08,373 --> 01:05:10,329
On the face of it, it looks bad.

697
01:05:10,533 --> 01:05:13,969
Look like we in a hopeless position.

698
01:05:14,653 --> 01:05:17,372
And that's our one strong point.

699
01:05:19,733 --> 01:05:22,293
Don't sound like
no strong point to me.

700
01:05:22,693 --> 01:05:23,887
Way I figure it...

701
01:05:24,093 --> 01:05:27,927
...Brent and this senator must be
feeling mighty smug.

702
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,442
Like they got us
where they want us.

703
01:05:30,613 --> 01:05:33,730
Toeing the line, scared to death.

704
01:05:35,253 --> 01:05:37,005
Well, from now on...

705
01:05:37,173 --> 01:05:39,323
...we gonna do everything we can...

706
01:05:39,533 --> 01:05:42,923
...to make sure they go
right on feeling that way.

707
01:05:48,373 --> 01:05:49,965
Clumsy fool!

708
01:05:50,173 --> 01:05:52,004
Look after Mrs. Randall.

709
01:05:52,213 --> 01:05:54,727
I wanna see what's going on out there.

710
01:05:57,773 --> 01:06:01,049
You dumb black boy.
Can't I trust you to do nothing?

711
01:06:01,253 --> 01:06:04,450
I want every grain of that
back in the sack!

712
01:06:09,173 --> 01:06:11,129
I's trying, Mr. Johnson.

713
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:15,724
You ain't trying hard enough.
I don't want no sacks full of dirt.

714
01:06:15,893 --> 01:06:16,882
Those darkies...

715
01:06:17,053 --> 01:06:21,171
...they was bad enough under slavery,
but now they's useless.

716
01:06:22,133 --> 01:06:23,532
I's done, sir.

717
01:06:23,733 --> 01:06:25,689
What are you waiting on, boy?

718
01:06:25,893 --> 01:06:28,930
Get the rest of the sacks
out of there!

719
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:35,724
Would you move your black backside?!
Move it! Move it!

720
01:06:39,773 --> 01:06:42,367
- Well, George.
- Oh, Mr. Brent.

721
01:06:42,613 --> 01:06:43,966
I see you've learned.

722
01:06:44,173 --> 01:06:47,085
I wasn't too sure about
overseeing them darkies...

723
01:06:47,293 --> 01:06:50,126
...as you well know,
but I wanna tell you...

724
01:06:50,293 --> 01:06:52,682
...it beats farming all to hell.

725
01:06:52,853 --> 01:06:55,765
- I wanna thank you.
- That's all right, son.

726
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:57,731
Just don't you let up.

727
01:06:57,933 --> 01:07:01,642
Don't you worry.
I keeps on them all the time.

728
01:07:01,973 --> 01:07:04,168
You'll do, Georgie, you'll do.

729
01:07:05,173 --> 01:07:07,084
Oh, please, sir.

730
01:07:07,333 --> 01:07:08,527
Please.

731
01:07:12,373 --> 01:07:14,489
We don't want no more trouble.

732
01:07:15,973 --> 01:07:19,090
If my man goes up
in front of the judge...

733
01:07:19,533 --> 01:07:21,683
...they'll kill him, sure.

734
01:07:24,053 --> 01:07:27,363
I got two little babies, sir.

735
01:07:29,013 --> 01:07:32,369
Now what we gonna do
if they kills my man?

736
01:07:34,693 --> 01:07:36,445
Oh, please, sir.

737
01:07:38,213 --> 01:07:41,569
You mean Tom wants to
forget this whole thing...

738
01:07:43,453 --> 01:07:46,092
...and drop the charges?

739
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:51,168
I swears to God you won't never
hear from him again.

740
01:07:51,893 --> 01:07:54,282
Well, you seem like a good girl...

741
01:07:55,413 --> 01:07:58,769
...so I'm gonna do something
that I hadn't ought to do.

742
01:08:06,613 --> 01:08:08,888
This is your husband's property.

743
01:08:09,973 --> 01:08:12,612
You do with it what you want to do.

744
01:08:24,373 --> 01:08:26,091
God bless you, sir.

745
01:08:49,173 --> 01:08:51,926
I think that's about everything
he asked for.

746
01:08:53,733 --> 01:08:55,007
Thank you, sir.

747
01:08:55,493 --> 01:08:57,211
Just a minute there, boy.

748
01:08:58,493 --> 01:09:00,449
I ain't done with you yet.

749
01:09:02,813 --> 01:09:06,169
- Yes, sir?
- Fetch me a dipper of water, nigger.

750
01:09:11,573 --> 01:09:13,006
Yes, sir.

751
01:09:36,533 --> 01:09:40,651
I do believe that's the sweetest water
I ever tasted.

752
01:09:40,853 --> 01:09:42,286
Yes, sir.

753
01:09:42,613 --> 01:09:44,524
Fetch you some more, sir?

754
01:09:45,213 --> 01:09:46,328
No.

755
01:09:47,253 --> 01:09:49,323
But I sure did appreciate it.

756
01:09:51,773 --> 01:09:54,082
You're shaping up into a good boy.

757
01:09:54,373 --> 01:09:56,409
Thank you, sir. I's trying.

758
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:58,604
You can run along now.

759
01:10:17,773 --> 01:10:22,528
You see that uppity Tom fetch me
a dipper of water, nice and polite?

760
01:10:22,733 --> 01:10:24,769
- Yes, I did.
- Did my heart good.

761
01:10:25,013 --> 01:10:27,686
Charlie tells me Tom's wife was in...

762
01:10:27,933 --> 01:10:30,766
...begging to have them charges dropped.

763
01:10:30,973 --> 01:10:33,612
We can rest easy
about the Harvey place.

764
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:37,852
- Yes, it looks that way.
- Something troubling you, senator?

765
01:10:38,093 --> 01:10:41,051
It's been my experience
one should not depend...

766
01:10:41,253 --> 01:10:43,813
...on an unbroken series
of fortunate events.

767
01:10:44,613 --> 01:10:49,164
This idyllic behavior is either
to conceal furtive activity...

768
01:10:50,093 --> 01:10:54,644
...or a tribute to George Johnson's
ability to work a miracle.

769
01:10:54,853 --> 01:10:59,404
- Johnson seems to have things in hand.
- I do not reject the miracle.

770
01:11:00,453 --> 01:11:03,013
I simply think
it should be put to the test.

771
01:11:03,253 --> 01:11:07,724
- Have you been to the farm yourself?
- Not recently.

772
01:11:07,893 --> 01:11:10,327
I've been busy at the store.

773
01:11:10,693 --> 01:11:17,087
A little drive out there, unannounced,
might teach us something.

774
01:11:25,693 --> 01:11:28,571
Stop lollygagging.
Put your backs into it!

775
01:11:28,773 --> 01:11:30,889
You think this is a picnic?

776
01:11:31,093 --> 01:11:32,572
I got my eye on you.

777
01:11:32,773 --> 01:11:36,083
You put your black back into it,
or I'll do it for you!

778
01:11:46,773 --> 01:11:49,571
Good day, senator. Mr. Brent.

779
01:11:49,773 --> 01:11:51,047
Hello, young man.

780
01:11:51,293 --> 01:11:53,932
Wanted to see
how you're getting on.

781
01:11:54,133 --> 01:11:58,763
Ain't as far long with
the planting as I'd like to be.

782
01:11:59,013 --> 01:12:00,969
We's cleaning up
what the nightriders did.

783
01:12:01,213 --> 01:12:04,364
But things is coming along.
It's coming along.

784
01:12:04,613 --> 01:12:07,002
- Massa Johnson?
- Lewis, what is it now?

785
01:12:07,213 --> 01:12:12,048
We'd like you to look
at the fence we's fixing.

786
01:12:12,293 --> 01:12:16,650
Go on back and keep working,
and I'll be there directly.

787
01:12:17,813 --> 01:12:20,247
- Thank you, sir.
- Go on, now.

788
01:12:22,293 --> 01:12:26,002
The blacks, they just
like little kiddies.

789
01:12:26,253 --> 01:12:28,721
Can't do nothing on their own.

790
01:12:32,613 --> 01:12:35,650
I guess we ought to get
back to town.

791
01:12:35,853 --> 01:12:39,163
Seems like Mr. Johnson's
got his work in order.

792
01:12:40,493 --> 01:12:42,370
Be seeing you, George.

793
01:12:42,853 --> 01:12:46,971
- You keep after them, you hear?
- Don't you worry none.

794
01:12:47,173 --> 01:12:49,164
Good day, senator.

795
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:56,892
Oh, Mr. Brent!

796
01:13:01,253 --> 01:13:03,847
Mr. Harvey's mules
is on their last legs.

797
01:13:04,053 --> 01:13:07,329
They ain't hardly pulling
worth their feed.

798
01:13:07,733 --> 01:13:10,372
If I could have me six young mules...

799
01:13:10,573 --> 01:13:13,167
...I could plant another 1 00 acres.

800
01:13:13,653 --> 01:13:14,722
Senator?

801
01:13:15,253 --> 01:13:19,565
I think Mr. Johnson's enterprise
ought to be encouraged.

802
01:13:19,933 --> 01:13:23,767
I'll get them out here
as soon as I can. Anything else?

803
01:13:24,053 --> 01:13:27,250
No, I think I got
everything I need now, sir.

804
01:13:27,493 --> 01:13:31,691
- I'll get six mules out tomorrow.
- I'm much obliged.

805
01:13:58,933 --> 01:14:00,286
Mr. Brent!

806
01:14:00,773 --> 01:14:05,847
You gotta come out to the farm.
It's Georgie!

807
01:14:06,093 --> 01:14:10,006
All right, missy. Just calm down.
Tell me what happened.

808
01:14:10,253 --> 01:14:14,451
Georgie had an accident.
I think his leg is broke.

809
01:14:14,613 --> 01:14:18,003
- We better go get Doc Farrell.
- I went there first.

810
01:14:18,213 --> 01:14:21,330
He's on his way. But my husband
want you to come.

811
01:14:21,493 --> 01:14:24,690
He's afraid the darkies will
take advantage and run off.

812
01:14:24,853 --> 01:14:28,687
- Mr. Brent, you gotta come.
- All right! Calm down.

813
01:14:28,893 --> 01:14:31,965
It'll be all right.
Get back to your husband.

814
01:14:32,173 --> 01:14:36,212
I'll ride out soon as I can.
Get! Get, you hear!

815
01:14:47,133 --> 01:14:49,044
Over here, Mr. Brent.

816
01:15:02,813 --> 01:15:04,769
How's he doing, doc?

817
01:15:05,253 --> 01:15:08,131
He all right, Mr. Brent.
But you ain't.

818
01:15:09,013 --> 01:15:11,481
What are you doing? Put that gun down.

819
01:15:12,093 --> 01:15:16,803
We leaving this county.
We're making sure you won't stop us.

820
01:15:17,453 --> 01:15:20,490
You been bamboozled, Mr. Brent!

821
01:15:20,853 --> 01:15:23,128
Why, you dirty nigger lover!

822
01:15:23,533 --> 01:15:25,205
Mr. Brent...

823
01:15:25,453 --> 01:15:27,250
...it ain't I loves niggers so much...

824
01:15:27,493 --> 01:15:30,963
...it's just I don't like you at all.

825
01:15:31,213 --> 01:15:33,488
You're not as smart as you think.

826
01:15:33,693 --> 01:15:35,206
That ain't the point.

827
01:15:35,453 --> 01:15:39,128
The point is, we ain't as dumb
as you think we is.

828
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:42,928
Because if we's that dumb,
what's that make you?

829
01:15:43,133 --> 01:15:45,931
We're taking charge. Drop that gun.

830
01:15:50,733 --> 01:15:53,930
Think I'm crazy enough
to ride out here alone?

831
01:15:54,733 --> 01:15:59,568
I didn't live through no war to walk
into an ambush with eyes wide open.

832
01:16:00,893 --> 01:16:02,087
Boy...

833
01:16:03,053 --> 01:16:07,444
...if you got any skin left
on that black carcass of yours...

834
01:16:07,653 --> 01:16:09,245
...you're about to lose it.

835
01:16:11,493 --> 01:16:14,451
Where's the rest of them
no-account niggers?

836
01:16:18,253 --> 01:16:20,369
Believe I asked you a question.

837
01:16:21,533 --> 01:16:25,606
- Did you hear me?
- No! Please! They're in the barn.

838
01:16:45,333 --> 01:16:46,971
Come on out of there!

839
01:16:47,173 --> 01:16:49,482
I know you're in there.

840
01:16:49,693 --> 01:16:52,526
I'll be hard on you
if I have to go in there.

841
01:16:54,773 --> 01:16:56,525
Break that door down.

842
01:17:05,653 --> 01:17:07,564
Hold it right there, boss.

843
01:17:09,173 --> 01:17:10,572
Now...

844
01:17:11,053 --> 01:17:14,011
...I'd drop them guns...

845
01:17:14,493 --> 01:17:17,371
...kind of nice and easy like.

846
01:17:20,213 --> 01:17:22,249
Pick up the pop pistols.

847
01:17:25,213 --> 01:17:27,966
Now, what if...?

848
01:17:28,373 --> 01:17:31,763
This is the way my captain
used to teach us to think.

849
01:17:31,973 --> 01:17:37,570
"What if the enemy figures out
your first plan?

850
01:17:37,813 --> 01:17:40,452
What you gonna do?

851
01:17:41,533 --> 01:17:44,730
Get yourself another plan! "

852
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:48,210
Who the hell are you?

853
01:17:50,573 --> 01:17:52,848
I'm the daddy of these boys.

854
01:17:53,013 --> 01:17:56,972
Don't you remember me?
You chased me out of the county once.

855
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:59,767
Now, all I wants to do...

856
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:03,369
...is leave the county peaceably.

857
01:18:04,173 --> 01:18:06,368
Tie them up, boys.

858
01:18:07,013 --> 01:18:09,766
Tom, he all yours now.

859
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,282
How do it feel, Mr. Brent?

860
01:18:50,933 --> 01:18:54,130
To be tied up
like a hog for slaughter...

861
01:18:54,933 --> 01:18:57,686
...waiting for your flesh
to turn to jelly?

862
01:18:59,213 --> 01:19:02,967
What do you feel like to be
on the other side of the lash?

863
01:19:03,213 --> 01:19:04,965
No, Tom... .

864
01:19:06,813 --> 01:19:09,168
Please.

865
01:19:58,013 --> 01:19:59,731
Time to go.

866
01:20:09,533 --> 01:20:11,091
Get moving.

867
01:20:12,013 --> 01:20:14,766
Get the children back there.
Sit down.

868
01:20:16,053 --> 01:20:17,372
Maria Jane!

869
01:20:17,573 --> 01:20:18,972
Come on up, Bud.

870
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:21,289
Got your young'uns, Tom?

871
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:33,007
My boy Tom has a good heart
and I admire his thinking.

872
01:20:33,893 --> 01:20:38,683
If you bother me or mine ever again...

873
01:20:39,093 --> 01:20:40,685
...I'll kill you.

874
01:20:56,853 --> 01:20:58,764
- Let's go.
- No.

875
01:20:59,093 --> 01:21:00,412
Not yet.

876
01:21:01,013 --> 01:21:05,450
I know you's sorry to be leaving.
We got to get moving.

877
01:21:05,653 --> 01:21:08,725
I been sitting here,
trying to remember.

878
01:21:10,413 --> 01:21:16,045
Been living here maybe 1 4, 1 5 years.

879
01:21:16,293 --> 01:21:18,170
I lost count.

880
01:21:20,213 --> 01:21:23,649
I helped Irene birth
all the grandchildren.

881
01:21:24,493 --> 01:21:26,006
Seen them grow.

882
01:21:28,053 --> 01:21:31,807
I held her second baby in my arms
when she die.

883
01:21:33,173 --> 01:21:37,405
We buried that sweet lamb
by the willow.

884
01:21:38,773 --> 01:21:44,166
I knows every chink in every wall
the winter wind blow through.

885
01:21:45,653 --> 01:21:46,802
I know...

886
01:21:47,213 --> 01:21:50,330
...it hard, old woman, leaving.

887
01:21:50,533 --> 01:21:52,364
Hard?

888
01:21:57,493 --> 01:21:59,404
Chicken George...

889
01:21:59,573 --> 01:22:02,610
...you is a foolish old man.

890
01:22:03,573 --> 01:22:07,532
There ain't nothing hard
about being happy.

891
01:22:09,493 --> 01:22:12,849
This ain't never been our home.

892
01:22:13,253 --> 01:22:16,245
Never belong to us no way!

893
01:22:17,253 --> 01:22:21,610
This here is Massa Harvey's
nigger quarters.

894
01:22:22,693 --> 01:22:29,087
When we ride out of here, I ain't
never gonna think of it again!

895
01:22:33,013 --> 01:22:34,446
Go on there, mule!

896
01:22:37,893 --> 01:22:39,804
Let's move on.

897
01:22:42,853 --> 01:22:46,163
Mr. Brent! Thank the senator
for these new mules.

898
01:22:46,413 --> 01:22:49,166
We never could've made it
without them!

899
01:24:05,853 --> 01:24:07,730
We's here!

900
01:24:07,933 --> 01:24:10,811
This here our land.

901
01:24:12,373 --> 01:24:14,603
Go on, mule, go on!

902
01:24:17,493 --> 01:24:19,006
Hold up there.

903
01:24:27,613 --> 01:24:30,366
You get down easy, honey.

904
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:33,205
Here's home.

905
01:24:33,453 --> 01:24:34,772
Bud.

906
01:24:35,733 --> 01:24:40,170
The first slave in this family
was my granddaddy...

907
01:24:40,613 --> 01:24:42,410
...Kunta Kinte.

908
01:24:42,813 --> 01:24:45,088
But he weren't always a slave.

909
01:24:45,853 --> 01:24:48,731
Before he was a slave
he was a free man...

910
01:24:48,933 --> 01:24:50,605
...in another country.

911
01:24:50,933 --> 01:24:53,731
A country called Africa.

912
01:24:54,453 --> 01:24:57,365
But then the slavers,
they catch him...

913
01:24:57,853 --> 01:25:01,732
...when he went to find some wood
to make a drum...

914
01:25:03,133 --> 01:25:05,249
...and they brung him to America.

915
01:25:05,453 --> 01:25:08,490
To a place called Annapolis.

916
01:25:09,173 --> 01:25:11,129
But Kunta Kinte...

917
01:25:11,613 --> 01:25:14,047
...he never forget where he come from.

918
01:25:14,253 --> 01:25:16,847
He never forget Africa.

919
01:25:17,013 --> 01:25:21,086
He never forget
the words he spoke as a child.

920
01:25:21,293 --> 01:25:23,648
How ko mean a fiddle...

921
01:25:23,853 --> 01:25:26,572
...and Kamby Bolongo mean a river.

922
01:25:26,773 --> 01:25:30,448
He never stop fighting against
his chains to be free again.

923
01:25:30,693 --> 01:25:36,165
Not even after they cut off half his
foot to keep him from running away.

924
01:25:38,813 --> 01:25:43,933
And before he die,
he give that dream of freedom...

925
01:25:44,253 --> 01:25:45,766
...to his daughter.

926
01:25:47,213 --> 01:25:48,487
Kizzy.

927
01:25:49,973 --> 01:25:51,531
My mama.

928
01:25:52,133 --> 01:25:57,571
And before she die,
she give that dream to me.

929
01:25:58,213 --> 01:26:03,162
And I've tried to keep that dream
alive in all you children...

930
01:26:03,413 --> 01:26:05,927
...till that day come.

931
01:26:06,853 --> 01:26:10,004
Hear me, old African...

932
01:26:10,213 --> 01:26:12,090
...the flesh...

933
01:26:12,293 --> 01:26:14,124
...of your flesh...

934
01:26:15,133 --> 01:26:17,488
...has come to freedom.

935
01:26:18,093 --> 01:26:21,210
You is free at last.

936
01:26:23,533 --> 01:26:26,969
We is free!

937
01:27:21,293 --> 01:27:24,763
The family did settle
in Henning, Tennessee.

938
01:27:24,973 --> 01:27:28,045
Matilda passed away
before Chicken George.

939
01:27:28,213 --> 01:27:32,047
And he enjoyed life among
his children and grandchildren...

940
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:36,126
...until he died
at the ripe old age of 83.

941
01:27:36,453 --> 01:27:40,571
The blacksmith, Tom,
and his talented Irene prospered.

942
01:27:40,773 --> 01:27:47,167
Their daughter, Cynthia, married
a quiet black man named Will Palmer...

943
01:27:47,373 --> 01:27:50,410
...who came to own
the town 's lumber mill.

944
01:27:50,613 --> 01:27:52,922
They had a daughter named Bertha...

945
01:27:53,133 --> 01:27:55,124
...who attended Lane College...

946
01:27:55,333 --> 01:27:59,042
...where she met and married
Simon Alexander Haley.

947
01:27:59,253 --> 01:28:02,962
In 1 92 1, the Haleys welcomed a son...

948
01:28:03,173 --> 01:28:07,086
...the seventh generation descendant
of Kunta Kinte.

949
01:28:07,733 --> 01:28:10,327
That boy was me, Alex Haley.

950
01:28:10,533 --> 01:28:14,765
I never forgot those stories which
my grandmother Cynthia told me.

951
01:28:14,933 --> 01:28:20,053
And in 1 963, after I had retired from
a career in the U.S. Coast Guard...

952
01:28:20,253 --> 01:28:24,485
...I became obsessed with knowing
more about our family...

953
01:28:24,693 --> 01:28:26,251
...more about its history.

954
01:28:26,453 --> 01:28:30,332
It was a search that would take me
1 2 years to complete.

955
01:28:30,533 --> 01:28:35,402
And those things that I learned,
I wrote in a book called Roots.
