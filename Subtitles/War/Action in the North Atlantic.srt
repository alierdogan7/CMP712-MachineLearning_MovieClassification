1
00:01:25,197 --> 00:01:27,188
<i>My name is Joe Rossi.</i>

2
00:01:27,265 --> 00:01:32,225
<i>I'm first mate on this tanker steaming</i>
<i>north to join the east-bound convoy,</i>

3
00:01:32,304 --> 00:01:36,035
<i>and we got 100,000 barrels</i>
<i>of high-test gas slopping in our holds.</i>

4
00:01:37,342 --> 00:01:39,867
<i>Stuff that makes tanks roar and planes fly.</i>

5
00:01:39,945 --> 00:01:43,346
<i>Where are we heading? Well, this is war.</i>

6
00:01:43,482 --> 00:01:47,612
<i>We're shipping under sealed orders,</i>
<i>but it's in the right direction.</i>

7
00:02:03,268 --> 00:02:05,998
Fog's coming in. Get it, mister?

8
00:02:06,538 --> 00:02:07,971
Yeah, Skipper.

9
00:02:08,273 --> 00:02:11,640
We've been running through patches of it
for half an hour.

10
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,201
The main bank's over there to port.

11
00:02:15,814 --> 00:02:17,839
-See something, mister?
-No, it's my tooth again.

12
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:21,443
I got a mouth full of little dwarfs
with red-hot pickaxes.

13
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,080
You had that toothache
on our last voyage.

14
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:26,124
Why didn't you get it fixed
when we were in port?

15
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:29,490
When I'm in port, I want to see something
better-looking than a dentist.

16
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:31,927
-You rate a toothache.
-I'd say.

17
00:02:32,531 --> 00:02:34,590
That's punishment for my sins.

18
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:38,434
It'd take more than a toothache
to pay for your sins.

19
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:41,995
The women.
Honolulu, Port Said, Cape Town.

20
00:02:42,207 --> 00:02:43,970
Police in Singapore.

21
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:48,070
I reckon you've been in trouble
in every deep-water port in the world.

22
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:50,341
I can't think of any I missed.

23
00:02:51,183 --> 00:02:53,879
-Fog' s gonna shut in thick before dawn.
-Yeah.

24
00:02:58,423 --> 00:02:59,583
Parker.

25
00:03:01,993 --> 00:03:03,654
-Yes, sir?
-Pass the word along to the bos'n,

26
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:07,096
-I want a double lookout fore and aft.
-Aye, aye, sir.

27
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:12,667
Expecting trouble, sir?

28
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:15,696
You are here to learn, Parker.
Here's your first lesson.

29
00:03:15,774 --> 00:03:17,401
It's an old law of the sea.

30
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:19,774
Don't ask questions
when you're given an order.

31
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:21,107
Yes, sir.

32
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,079
You know, that kid's gonna be all right.

33
00:03:30,155 --> 00:03:32,385
Remember when you were
his age, Skipper?

34
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:34,425
Yes, mister. I remember.

35
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:38,020
When I was as old as Parker, I'd sailed
around the Horn in a square rigger.

36
00:03:38,096 --> 00:03:39,495
I came up the fo'c'sle myself.

37
00:03:39,564 --> 00:03:41,896
But we haven't got time
to train kids that way nowadays.

38
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:43,332
How else can you learn the sea?

39
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:46,632
By rigging a kid in a fancy cadet's uniform
and sticking his nose in a book?

40
00:03:46,705 --> 00:03:49,401
Oh, why don't you give him a chance?
He'll catch on.

41
00:03:49,474 --> 00:03:50,736
Catch on.

42
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:54,570
The difference between you and me,
Skipper, one of the differences is,

43
00:03:54,646 --> 00:03:57,979
you remember the grief.
I remember the fun.

44
00:03:59,117 --> 00:04:02,985
Next time we get in port,
see a dentist. First.

45
00:04:18,036 --> 00:04:20,596
You know something?
The last tub I shipped out on was so old

46
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:23,698
that I found a pair of Christopher
Columbus' cufflinks in a locker.

47
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:26,505
-Did you have a gun on her?
-Certainly, it had a gun on her.

48
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:28,239
But, holy mackerel,
we'd ever had to fire it,

49
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:31,248
-the whole ship would have fallen apart.
-Okay. Deal me in.

50
00:04:31,316 --> 00:04:33,045
This here belly wash gets worse everyday.

51
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:35,086
Well, if it's belly wash,
you don't have to drink it.

52
00:04:35,153 --> 00:04:39,317
-All right then, it's hogwash.
-Here you go, Peaches. Lap her up, baby.

53
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:41,552
So you been robbing
my canned cow again?

54
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:44,186
What do you think we're gonna use
for milk this trip? Bilge water?

55
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:46,594
Oh, lay off, Caviar.
Peaches has gotta have her cream.

56
00:04:46,665 --> 00:04:49,156
Now, you keep out of my galley,
or I'll cut your liver out

57
00:04:49,234 --> 00:04:51,293
and feed it to the cat.

58
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,528
Excuse me. I've got an order for the bos'n.

59
00:04:53,605 --> 00:04:55,197
Hey, Boats.
Captain's boy wants to see you.

60
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:56,865
-Bos'n, the Skipper...
-Hey, look out!

61
00:04:56,942 --> 00:04:58,068
Now what?

62
00:04:58,143 --> 00:05:00,338
Next time you come in here,
put your feet in your pocket.

63
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:03,142
I'm sorry. Bos'n, the Skipper wants
a double lookout fore and aft.

64
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:05,581
What's the matter? The old man nervous?

65
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,118
Send somebody else.
Don't break up the game.

66
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:09,517
Let's see, on the flip.

67
00:05:09,588 --> 00:05:13,217
-Hey, what's the idea?
-Oh, you wouldn't have won, anyway.

68
00:05:14,826 --> 00:05:16,589
-Lay off them cards.
-You take it, too, Larson.

69
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:18,458
You're squeezing us out
because we're losing.

70
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,794
You're sore 'cause I called you
when you had a pair of deuces.

71
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:22,458
Now, would I do a thing like that?
Would I?

72
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:24,502
-Yes.
-You certainly would.

73
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:26,537
How you getting along
with your books, professor?

74
00:05:26,605 --> 00:05:28,266
-Swell, thanks.
-Hey, you better study good

75
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,537
or the Skipper'll put you in a corner
with a dunce cap.

76
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:33,845
Leave it open, sweetheart.

77
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:36,346
When I got it off Hatteras,
six guys was caught in the fo'c'sle

78
00:05:36,414 --> 00:05:38,507
'cause the door buckled
and they couldn't bust her loose.

79
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,574
-Sorry.
-Hey, deal me in.

80
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:43,519
How did a Kansas hay-shaker like that
ever happen to go to sea?

81
00:05:43,588 --> 00:05:44,885
Why does anybody ever go to sea?

82
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:46,184
Why does anybody go to...

83
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:48,385
Now, to be out here
in a rust-pot full of high-test gasoline,

84
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,394
a guy has to be muscle-bound
between the ears.

85
00:05:50,462 --> 00:05:52,362
If a torpedo ever connected with this ship,

86
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,127
we'd go up like a match lighted
to cellophane. You ain't got a chance.

87
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:58,567
Boom. And you're in the hero department,
just like that.

88
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:01,265
And the next thing you know, you're
picking the Milky Way out of your ears.

89
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:03,432
-Okay. Okay. So what?
-What do you mean, okay?

90
00:06:03,508 --> 00:06:04,839
Now, wait a minute.

91
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,174
I think you got the wrong angle.

92
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:10,408
The way I see it, if your ship's number
is up, you're gonna get it.

93
00:06:10,482 --> 00:06:12,814
Yeah? And suppose my number ain't up?

94
00:06:12,884 --> 00:06:15,580
Then, brother, torpedoes can connect
right where you're sitting,

95
00:06:15,654 --> 00:06:16,985
and still nothing'll happen.

96
00:06:17,055 --> 00:06:20,718
Well, I want no torpedoes where
I'm sitting. I'm a sensitive man, I am.

97
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:22,316
Oh, what do you know about it, anyway?

98
00:06:22,394 --> 00:06:24,589
You carpenters,
you got sawdust for brains.

99
00:06:24,663 --> 00:06:25,687
Listen.

100
00:06:25,764 --> 00:06:28,961
I was shipping out
when your buttons were safety pins.

101
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:30,934
I was in a tanker in the last war.

102
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:33,402
I got torpedoed so much,
I got water on the knee.

103
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,439
What made you ship out again?

104
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:38,874
Well, for years, I had my own business.

105
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:41,807
I got my own house, too.
Got a little money put away.

106
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,075
Then what're you doing out here
in this floating junk pile?

107
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:46,549
Well, I want to keep my business
and my house,

108
00:06:46,618 --> 00:06:49,086
and I figure this is a smart way to do it.

109
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:52,783
We didn't ask for this war.
I know I didn't. None of us did.

110
00:06:52,857 --> 00:06:54,825
-And now all of us are in it.
-Sure, sure.

111
00:06:54,893 --> 00:06:56,861
With you in the war,
we got nothing to worry about.

112
00:06:56,928 --> 00:07:00,887
-It's an open and shut proposition.
-I got faith in God,

113
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:04,034
President Roosevelt
and the Brooklyn Dodgers.

114
00:07:04,102 --> 00:07:06,502
In the order of their importance.

115
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:44,162
Boys, the only reason I'm here

116
00:08:44,235 --> 00:08:46,226
is because this is one place
my wife cannot get at me.

117
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:48,397
I thought you settled that alimony beef
with your missus.

118
00:08:48,473 --> 00:08:49,804
I did. But I got married again.

119
00:08:49,874 --> 00:08:52,035
And you're running away
from the new one so quick?

120
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,634
Well, they chase me, so I gotta run.

121
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:55,338
Why, they think
they can cut alimony off me

122
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:57,381
like you'd carve blubber off a whale!

123
00:08:57,449 --> 00:09:00,748
Hey, Boats, what happened to that dame
in San Diego, name of Rose?

124
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:02,081
Oh, she's still around.
She got married, I think.

125
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:04,018
-No, she's still on the loose.
-Hey, I know her.

126
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:05,716
You guys are talking
about a different dame.

127
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,984
The same one.

128
00:09:07,058 --> 00:09:09,185
Said her folks come West
in a covered wagon.

129
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,818
Yeah, you take one look at her face,

130
00:09:10,895 --> 00:09:13,420
and you'd know
why they had to keep it covered.

131
00:09:13,498 --> 00:09:15,398
She looked like Frank Buck
brung her back alive.

132
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:16,456
Hell of a lady.

133
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:18,502
Can't you guys talk
about anything but women?

134
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,596
-What else is there to talk about?
-Well, I ain't no hero.

135
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:27,439
I just went to sea for a summer vacation.
That was 10 years ago.

136
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:28,877
How about some of that night lunch?

137
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:30,972
Why don't you give
that tapeworm of yours a rest?

138
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:32,482
Why should I? It don't give me none.

139
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,847
With that grub you serve on this ship,

140
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:35,351
it's no wonder we're hungry all the time.

141
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,445
I notice you shovel in plenty of it.

142
00:09:37,522 --> 00:09:40,150
Yeah, but it don't agree with me. See?

143
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:41,783
Whitey, give me a ham on rye, will you?

144
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,920
The last ship I was on, we eat like the Ritz.

145
00:09:44,996 --> 00:09:48,022
The last ship?
Every day I hear the same beef.

146
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:50,124
You're always bragging
about the last ship.

147
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:52,431
And when you sail again,
this'll be the last ship,

148
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:55,496
and you'll be yapping about me
being the greatest cook that ever sailed.

149
00:09:55,573 --> 00:09:56,870
And you'll be right, too.

150
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:59,205
Well, I think you're a pretty good...

151
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:01,303
My corns.

152
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:04,439
-Oh, you and your feet.
-Oh, I got very sensitive feet.

153
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:07,280
I found out in the last war.
My corns always hurt

154
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:09,343
when there's a sub around.

155
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:12,687
You know, my feet, they hurt all the time.

156
00:10:12,757 --> 00:10:15,692
-But they don't tell me nothing.
-No kidding. My corns are burning me up.

157
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,660
Why don't you shut up about them corns?

158
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:21,529
-He gets messages in his toes.
-Why don't you bottle them corns?

159
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,525
Say, can't that machine play nothing else?

160
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:27,366
Stop beating your gums, brother. I like it.

161
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:29,065
I had a girl who used to sing that.

162
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,631
She had a baby face and a brain to match.

163
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:36,207
I taught it to her.

164
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,591
Oh, brother. If that was a dame,
you couldn't shut her up that easy.

165
00:11:46,918 --> 00:11:49,113
-They got us!
-Those dirty...

166
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:17,308
Go aft! Get everybody on deck.

167
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:26,880
Pop, we've gotta get up on deck.

168
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:41,197
-Where are you going, Pop?
-My teeth. I gotta get my teeth.

169
00:12:41,272 --> 00:12:44,332
You won't need teeth to chew saltwater.
Get above.

170
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,405
Sound general alarm. All hands on deck.

171
00:12:47,478 --> 00:12:48,968
Aye, aye, sir.

172
00:13:00,224 --> 00:13:01,953
Check the damage aft.

173
00:13:10,968 --> 00:13:13,801
-Stand by that raft.
-Can't raise the engine room.

174
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:15,736
Parker, follow me to aft
and report back to me.

175
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:16,796
Aye, aye, sir.

176
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:23,310
Break out all hands, Steve!

177
00:13:31,856 --> 00:13:33,448
How is it below?

178
00:13:35,093 --> 00:13:37,994
The engine room's flooded.
We're making water fast!

179
00:13:38,196 --> 00:13:40,221
You stay here
and see that everybody gets out.

180
00:13:40,298 --> 00:13:41,287
Aye, aye, sir.

181
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:24,139
Hit her square
in the engine room, Captain.

182
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,800
She's flooding fast.

183
00:14:25,877 --> 00:14:28,004
We're going to abandon ship!

184
00:14:36,154 --> 00:14:38,088
Stand by to lower away!

185
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:50,927
Peaches!

186
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:52,628
Peaches.

187
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:55,805
Peaches, baby, where are you?

188
00:14:55,873 --> 00:14:59,104
Where are you,
you darn fool cat? Peaches?

189
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:04,847
Peaches, baby. Come here, Peaches.

190
00:15:07,351 --> 00:15:10,218
Come on, sweetheart.
Daddy's gonna take care of you.

191
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:43,012
-Let me have him, kid.
-Thanks, mister.

192
00:15:52,897 --> 00:15:55,297
Hey, Mack. Give me that fall.

193
00:15:56,534 --> 00:16:00,265
Hey, you can't take that with you.
Think you're going to Atlantic City?

194
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:03,432
-Hey, where are your pants, Johnnie?
-I forgot them.

195
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,434
Number one raft!

196
00:16:36,107 --> 00:16:38,098
-Lend a hand over here.
-...sail!

197
00:16:49,387 --> 00:16:51,548
Some of the engine room gang
are trapped aft, sir.

198
00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:54,819
-Tell Sparks to sign off and get in the boat.
-Aye, aye, sir.

199
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:05,531
Get in the boat. Get away!

200
00:17:06,804 --> 00:17:08,032
What about those men trapped aft?

201
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:09,595
I couldn't get to them.
There's nothing we could do.

202
00:17:09,674 --> 00:17:11,005
Don't tell me what I can do, mister.

203
00:17:11,075 --> 00:17:15,136
Steve, there's nothing in the book
that says you gotta burn with your ship.

204
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:22,777
-Waiting for you, sir.
-Yeah, I'm ready.

205
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:28,614
Sparks. We're shoving off. Come on. Hurry.

206
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:30,718
I'm signing off now.

207
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:02,948
Tex!

208
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:10,330
You all right?

209
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:13,430
Look out!

210
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:16,296
Come on, get out of here!

211
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:45,929
-Ready, Skipper?
-You first, Mr. Rossi.

212
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:04,712
-Let go the falls!
-Let go the falls!

213
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:05,983
Send off!

214
00:19:06,924 --> 00:19:09,017
-Out oars!
-Out oars, men!

215
00:19:19,804 --> 00:19:22,238
Come on, Tex, let's get in that boat!

216
00:19:28,212 --> 00:19:31,181
Tex, we're cut off. Let's go forward.
Come on!

217
00:19:41,058 --> 00:19:43,288
We're cut off. We gotta go back.

218
00:19:50,434 --> 00:19:53,870
Step on that stroke.
Let's get out of this oil.

219
00:20:05,516 --> 00:20:07,040
There's two men.

220
00:20:10,855 --> 00:20:14,757
-Circle about and pick them up.
-Give way, port. Backwater, starboard.

221
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:17,726
Wait, you gotta take that off.
You can't swim with that in the water.

222
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:19,695
If you make it, remember me, John.

223
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:40,777
-They're swimming through the fire.
-Pull on those oars!

224
00:20:40,851 --> 00:20:43,820
-They'll never make it.
-They haven't got a chance.

225
00:20:45,956 --> 00:20:47,048
Tex!

226
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,614
Tex!

227
00:21:03,107 --> 00:21:04,870
There he is! Pick him up.

228
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:11,043
Pulaski! Come on.

229
00:21:11,682 --> 00:21:13,013
Get in here.

230
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:14,545
That's it.

231
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:16,750
Who was it?

232
00:21:17,888 --> 00:21:18,946
Tex.

233
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:42,008
There's the stinking pigboat!

234
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,242
Yeah, they smell so bad,
they've gotta come up for air!

235
00:21:49,353 --> 00:21:50,377
Lay on those oars!

236
00:21:50,454 --> 00:21:53,321
Give way portside, backwater starboard.

237
00:22:15,813 --> 00:22:17,144
Where is your captain?

238
00:22:17,214 --> 00:22:19,307
Where do you think he is?
He's with his ship.

239
00:22:19,383 --> 00:22:22,819
-Why, they're taking pictures of us!
-We're in the movies, boys.

240
00:22:22,887 --> 00:22:24,878
Why, they're taking pictures
to show Hitler.

241
00:22:24,955 --> 00:22:27,048
It should have sound.
I could tell him something.

242
00:22:27,124 --> 00:22:29,217
Take your pictures, you murdering pirates!

243
00:22:29,293 --> 00:22:31,318
Let's give them this. Thumbs up!

244
00:22:39,003 --> 00:22:41,494
They're bearing down! Give way together.

245
00:22:51,048 --> 00:22:52,572
He's gonna ram us!

246
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,290
-Look out for the diving vanes!
-Jump clear!

247
00:23:09,366 --> 00:23:10,890
Clear of those propellers!

248
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:34,081
Peaches! Peaches!

249
00:23:34,191 --> 00:23:35,749
I lost Peaches!

250
00:23:35,993 --> 00:23:37,358
Make for the raft!

251
00:23:56,146 --> 00:23:57,773
They're moving off.

252
00:24:02,886 --> 00:24:05,047
Go on. Laugh, you apes!

253
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:08,083
You've had your blood and fire
to make you laugh.

254
00:24:08,158 --> 00:24:10,854
But I swear to God, our time is coming!

255
00:24:10,928 --> 00:24:12,555
We'll pay you back.

256
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,798
We'll hunt you down
and slice you like a piece of cheese!

257
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:18,858
Hey, they can't hear you.

258
00:24:18,969 --> 00:24:21,938
No, but God can.

259
00:25:03,013 --> 00:25:06,210
Tanker wreckage sighted
at position 2 cast 7.

260
00:25:06,283 --> 00:25:07,944
What ship is that?

261
00:25:08,052 --> 00:25:09,713
<i>Northern Star,</i> sir.

262
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:13,607
Look!

263
00:26:14,251 --> 00:26:15,616
Look at that.

264
00:26:24,795 --> 00:26:28,322
08U, calling Commander,
Destroyer Division 18.

265
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,426
Survivors on raft.

266
00:26:42,813 --> 00:26:44,144
Thank God.

267
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,021
-Which one of you men is Captain Jarvis?
-Me.

268
00:26:59,096 --> 00:27:01,587
-Your cigarette, sir.
-Glad to know you, Captain.

269
00:27:01,665 --> 00:27:03,257
I'm Jordon, Nationwide Newsreel Service.

270
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:06,496
We'd like to get some pictures
of you and your men.

271
00:27:14,111 --> 00:27:15,908
Now, Captain, will you tell us
in your own words

272
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:18,243
exactly what happened
when the torpedo hit the tanker?

273
00:27:18,315 --> 00:27:19,339
She caught fire.

274
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:21,077
Into the microphone, please, Captain.
Not to me.

275
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:22,778
-She caught fire.
-And then what happened?

276
00:27:22,853 --> 00:27:23,979
We took to the boats.

277
00:27:24,054 --> 00:27:27,251
<i>-Did you see the submarine at any time?</i>
<i>-Couldn't help seeing it. They rammed us.</i>

278
00:27:27,324 --> 00:27:28,552
And then what?

279
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,855
-We spent 11 days on a raft.
-I see.

280
00:27:30,928 --> 00:27:34,659
But here's our chief officer, Mr. Rossi.
Better hear from him.

281
00:27:34,731 --> 00:27:37,825
Thank you, Captain. Mr. Rossi,
are you going to ship out again, sir?

282
00:27:37,901 --> 00:27:39,061
Yeah. Why not?

283
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:42,264
If you live on the land and your home
burns down, you get another home.

284
00:27:42,339 --> 00:27:45,240
On the sea, it's the same way.
You see, a ship is our home.

285
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:48,005
If a ship burns, you get another ship.

286
00:27:48,245 --> 00:27:50,236
-That's the way it is, ain't it, men?
-Right.

287
00:27:50,314 --> 00:27:52,339
Thank you, Mr. Rossi.
Anybody else like to say anything?

288
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:54,816
Go on, tell them. Don't be afraid.

289
00:27:54,985 --> 00:27:56,646
What you gonna say, Boats?

290
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,813
-Your name, please?
-O'Hara.

291
00:27:59,223 --> 00:28:00,690
Alfred O'Hara.

292
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:05,223
Well, come on, fellows, hurry up, hurry up.

293
00:28:07,364 --> 00:28:10,458
Well, I've got a message
for Hitler, personally.

294
00:28:11,368 --> 00:28:13,563
My dear Adolph...

295
00:28:20,444 --> 00:28:22,742
-Hi, Cap. Thought you was at sea.
-I was.

296
00:28:22,813 --> 00:28:25,441
-Must have made a quick trip.
-I did.

297
00:28:33,156 --> 00:28:34,680
Oh, Stephen!

298
00:28:36,827 --> 00:28:38,192
Oh, darling.

299
00:28:38,962 --> 00:28:40,953
I just got your telegram an hour ago.

300
00:28:41,031 --> 00:28:44,262
-Up until then I couldn't find out a thing.
-Sarah.

301
00:28:44,334 --> 00:28:47,735
Why didn't you tell me when you
were coming? I'd have met the train.

302
00:28:47,804 --> 00:28:50,500
I didn't know what time I could get away.

303
00:28:50,574 --> 00:28:53,634
All these days without any news of you.

304
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,974
We were picked up by the Navy.

305
00:28:56,546 --> 00:28:59,014
They don't give out
much information these days.

306
00:28:59,082 --> 00:29:01,073
No, they can't, of course.

307
00:29:01,718 --> 00:29:03,777
She was a good ship, Sarah.

308
00:29:04,021 --> 00:29:06,922
-What about the men?
-Some of them were lost.

309
00:29:07,824 --> 00:29:11,885
-You all right?
-Oh, I'm fine. Fine.

310
00:29:12,496 --> 00:29:15,624
-You bought a new suit.
-Doesn't fit very well.

311
00:29:15,699 --> 00:29:17,428
You have a terrible sunburn.

312
00:29:17,501 --> 00:29:19,901
-Oh, it'll wear off.
-Oh, darling, I like it.

313
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,530
Oh, I've got so much to tell you about.

314
00:29:22,606 --> 00:29:24,403
Remember the Hopkins' boy, George?

315
00:29:24,474 --> 00:29:27,910
Well, he joined the Merchant Marine.
I really think he did it because of you.

316
00:29:27,978 --> 00:29:29,673
I'm awful hungry, Sarah.

317
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,117
Oh, this is wonderful!

318
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:42,057
I could soak in here for a month.

319
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:44,759
Of course, you know it's really dangerous

320
00:29:44,828 --> 00:29:47,422
to take a bath so soon after dinner.

321
00:29:47,497 --> 00:29:49,988
Too bad. I should have brought
my life belt with me.

322
00:30:03,714 --> 00:30:05,978
This feels so good.

323
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,051
I thought
I'd never get in one of these again.

324
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:20,458
Sleep well, darling.

325
00:30:25,802 --> 00:30:27,133
Oh, I know,

326
00:30:30,507 --> 00:30:33,874
this is so silly.
I'm only crying because I'm happy.

327
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:36,505
I just didn't want you to see.

328
00:30:37,147 --> 00:30:38,944
I knew it all the time.

329
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:46,616
After all these years,
wouldn't you think I'd be used to it?

330
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:49,487
Sarah, I've been through a lot of storms.

331
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,754
I've always come home to you.

332
00:30:51,995 --> 00:30:53,121
I know.

333
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:56,561
For a sailor's wife,

334
00:30:58,435 --> 00:31:00,733
this war is just another storm.

335
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,571
Oh, darling.

336
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:33,994
You rest well, darling. You rest.

337
00:31:58,428 --> 00:32:00,555
-Hello, Joe. Been away?
-Yeah.

338
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:10,233
-Joe Rossi. When did you get in?
-This morning.

339
00:32:10,841 --> 00:32:12,468
Good to see you.
Have a drink on the house.

340
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:14,066
No. You'd better have one with me.

341
00:32:14,144 --> 00:32:15,873
Hey, what've you got
that's good for a toothache?

342
00:32:15,946 --> 00:32:18,744
Oh, straight whisky. It'll kill it or cure it.

343
00:32:18,815 --> 00:32:21,784
-It never helped it before.
-Well, you never did it right.

344
00:32:21,852 --> 00:32:24,514
Look. Hold it in your mouth
next to your tooth,

345
00:32:24,588 --> 00:32:26,647
but don't swallow. Look.

346
00:32:31,761 --> 00:32:34,855
-Now I'll buy you one.
-Oh, don't swallow it, eh?

347
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:37,297
-Yeah, it feels better already.
-Excuse me, will you?

348
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:38,959
-Certainly.
-Good luck.

349
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:45,536
-Will you keep this for me, please, Charlie?
-Sure.

350
00:32:59,256 --> 00:33:01,087
-New face.
-Yeah.

351
00:33:27,617 --> 00:33:30,415
Troop trains coming in every hour,
all night long.

352
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:34,821
Planes, guns, ammunition. Why, you can
see them as plain as anything. Yes, sir.

353
00:33:34,891 --> 00:33:37,553
They must be sending off 50,000 men
every night.

354
00:33:37,627 --> 00:33:39,094
Some nights more than that.

355
00:33:39,162 --> 00:33:40,993
Do you remember that blackout
we had the other night?

356
00:33:41,064 --> 00:33:42,588
Supposed to be
Nazi planes hanging around.

357
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:44,634
Baloney! You know why they had it?

358
00:33:44,701 --> 00:33:47,101
They was sneaking ships out,
plenty of them.

359
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:50,264
And I'll tell you something. I happen
to know the names of them ships.

360
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,309
Hey, Jack.
The lady's singing. Do you mind?

361
00:33:53,376 --> 00:33:54,673
I don't mind.

362
00:33:54,744 --> 00:33:57,975
The <i>Western Star,</i>
11,000 tons, sailed an hour ago.

363
00:33:58,081 --> 00:34:00,641
-It was loaded with guns...
-Hey, Gus,

364
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:04,685
-do you want a drink?
-Excuse me.

365
00:34:09,993 --> 00:34:12,928
Maybe the news ain't reached you yet,
there's a war on.

366
00:34:12,996 --> 00:34:14,486
Sure. Ain't that what I been saying?

367
00:34:14,564 --> 00:34:16,293
Those are troop ships
going out to the front.

368
00:34:16,366 --> 00:34:19,392
The front's right off Sandy Hook.
It ain't more than 10 miles from here.

369
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:21,699
They're losing a lot of ships out there
just because of talk.

370
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:22,795
Talk? Nothing.

371
00:34:22,872 --> 00:34:25,033
Bombs and torpedoes
is what's been doing them sinking.

372
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:28,271
All those kids, thousands of them,
nothing but bait for Nazi submarines.

373
00:34:28,345 --> 00:34:30,370
I'm telling you,
there was 10 ships in that convoy!

374
00:34:30,447 --> 00:34:32,244
-You saw that, huh?
-Sure, I saw it.

375
00:34:32,315 --> 00:34:34,545
-With your own eyes?
-Of course, with my own eyes.

376
00:34:34,618 --> 00:34:36,449
Well, what do you know?

377
00:34:40,824 --> 00:34:42,951
Come here. I want to tell you something.

378
00:34:43,026 --> 00:34:45,586
A little closer. I want to whisper this.

379
00:34:51,368 --> 00:34:53,859
Now, Pete, maybe you won't talk so much.

380
00:34:53,937 --> 00:34:56,804
Hey, Charlie, I think our friend has
had a little bit too much to drink.

381
00:34:56,873 --> 00:34:58,170
-Don't you?
-Yeah.

382
00:34:58,241 --> 00:35:00,106
-Did you hurt your hand?
-Never do.

383
00:35:28,705 --> 00:35:29,797
Thanks.

384
00:35:32,976 --> 00:35:35,103
Hey, Charlie, another drink.

385
00:35:35,245 --> 00:35:37,110
You don't waste time between drinks,
do you?

386
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,943
I never waste time.

387
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:41,349
Go on, sing something else.

388
00:35:41,418 --> 00:35:44,080
Look, if you had to sock that guy,
why didn't you take him outside?

389
00:35:44,154 --> 00:35:45,519
I make my living here.

390
00:35:45,588 --> 00:35:50,048
Listen. I did it as neatly and as quietly
as I could, out of consideration to you.

391
00:35:50,126 --> 00:35:51,889
He should have had his teeth kicked in.

392
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:53,087
Big hero.

393
00:35:53,163 --> 00:35:55,654
What would you do
if a guy was shooting off his mouth?

394
00:35:55,732 --> 00:35:58,166
Turn him in, so he couldn't go
and talk someplace else.

395
00:35:58,234 --> 00:36:00,532
Well, that ain't direct enough for me.

396
00:36:00,603 --> 00:36:02,298
-Do you want a drink?
-No, thank you.

397
00:36:02,372 --> 00:36:03,964
I don't drink with strangers.

398
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,203
-Well, then sing.
-A command performance?

399
00:36:07,277 --> 00:36:09,905
Yeah. I like your voice.

400
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:12,705
That's not what you like about me.

401
00:36:12,782 --> 00:36:15,580
Well, that's all I know about you so far.

402
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:17,343
Here.

403
00:36:17,987 --> 00:36:21,013
I guess you two should know each other.
I guess.

404
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:23,855
-Joe Rossi, Miss O'Neil.
-How do you do?

405
00:36:25,628 --> 00:36:27,858
You better get that tooth fixed.

406
00:36:28,698 --> 00:36:30,063
Yeah, I think I will.

407
00:36:38,007 --> 00:36:39,099
Hiya, boys.

408
00:36:39,175 --> 00:36:42,167
I always wanted a classy tiepin
ever since I was a kid.

409
00:36:42,245 --> 00:36:45,874
So I tells the guy
the tiepin is on Davey Jones' necktie.

410
00:36:46,082 --> 00:36:49,745
So the buzzard gets sore and says,
"That don't cut no ice with me.

411
00:36:49,819 --> 00:36:51,616
"I still want my 80 bucks."

412
00:36:51,688 --> 00:36:53,417
So I says, "All right. Go sue Hitler."

413
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,482
-Well, what happened?
-So I paid the 80 bucks.

414
00:36:56,693 --> 00:36:58,456
-Hiya, fellas.
-Hi, gang.

415
00:36:58,795 --> 00:37:01,923
-Good hands you got, huh?
-Keep it quiet, will you?

416
00:37:03,366 --> 00:37:04,731
-Hiya, Whitey.
-Hiya, Joe.

417
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:07,099
-I hear you lost your cat.
-Yeah.

418
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,329
The sea is no place for dumb animals.

419
00:37:09,405 --> 00:37:11,771
When you take a cat or a dog
to sea, you gotta catch them young.

420
00:37:11,841 --> 00:37:14,207
-Then they don't get seasick.
-The only place to get seasick,

421
00:37:14,277 --> 00:37:17,144
-is underneath a tree.
-Okay. Drop it. Let's play poker.

422
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,080
One AB, two ordinary seamen, one wiper.

423
00:37:22,218 --> 00:37:24,516
-Relax. They're calling for a wiper.
-That ain't me.

424
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:30,484
Four oilers, four firemen, two wipers.

425
00:37:30,994 --> 00:37:35,124
-P.U. What smells bad around here?
-What do you mean, what smells bad?

426
00:37:35,198 --> 00:37:38,292
That perfume is worth five bucks a whiff.
I ought to charge you for it.

427
00:37:38,368 --> 00:37:41,064
You know it must be love when a dame
will sprinkle that all over you.

428
00:37:41,137 --> 00:37:43,367
More than 100 men
must have shipped out today.

429
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:46,101
A hundred? That's only a spit in the ocean.
It'll take thousands.

430
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:49,304
-They're building them ships so fast.
-Four oilers.

431
00:37:49,379 --> 00:37:50,869
Three ABs.

432
00:37:51,981 --> 00:37:55,348
That's the fourth time in the last half hour
they've called for ABs.

433
00:37:55,418 --> 00:37:58,046
-What're you waiting for?
-I ain't in no hurry.

434
00:37:58,121 --> 00:38:01,181
Well, I figure on shipping out today
or tomorrow.

435
00:38:01,257 --> 00:38:04,488
-You can't wait, can you?
-We was lucky once, we'll be lucky again.

436
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:06,586
Sure. Luck is riding on our tail.

437
00:38:06,663 --> 00:38:08,062
What's the matter? Don't you believe in it?

438
00:38:08,131 --> 00:38:09,792
I do. I once knew a fella

439
00:38:09,866 --> 00:38:11,766
got bombed three times
without being scratched.

440
00:38:11,835 --> 00:38:14,599
Then he drowns himself
taking a swim at Coney Island.

441
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:16,002
That's the way it goes.

442
00:38:16,072 --> 00:38:18,802
In a pig's eye.
I'm gonna get me a shore job.

443
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,968
Why should I commit suicide at my age?

444
00:38:21,044 --> 00:38:23,740
For my dough, the only safe run
is the Staten Island ferry.

445
00:38:23,813 --> 00:38:26,213
You'd look good on a Staten Island ferry.

446
00:38:26,282 --> 00:38:29,251
Yeah, and I'll go on looking good
when you're inside of a shark's belly.

447
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:31,685
I don't think
you'd like that Staten Island run, kid.

448
00:38:31,754 --> 00:38:33,915
-Why not?
-Well, you gotta pass the Statue of Liberty

449
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,356
going each way, and you might
not want to look her in the face.

450
00:38:36,426 --> 00:38:37,450
I don't mind.

451
00:38:37,527 --> 00:38:40,428
What're you hanging around the
hiring hall for, if you ain't shipping out?

452
00:38:40,496 --> 00:38:42,123
I got my rights. I'm paid up here.

453
00:38:42,198 --> 00:38:44,359
I'm a paid-up member of this union
in good standing.

454
00:38:44,434 --> 00:38:46,561
Listen. The only uniform we got
is a union button.

455
00:38:46,636 --> 00:38:48,729
And no guy's wearing one
who ain't got what it takes.

456
00:38:48,805 --> 00:38:50,397
And he ain't got it.

457
00:38:50,473 --> 00:38:52,634
And I ain't playing poker with no bedbugs.

458
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:56,008
-What's biting you?
-Come on, close your yap and deal.

459
00:38:56,412 --> 00:38:57,777
Deal me in.

460
00:38:58,014 --> 00:38:59,879
You guys are talking
like I was a kid or something.

461
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:01,746
Like I didn't know what the score was.

462
00:39:01,818 --> 00:39:04,651
Look, I've been shipping out for six years.

463
00:39:04,888 --> 00:39:07,356
It's one thing for you as single guys,
not a worry in the world.

464
00:39:07,423 --> 00:39:10,517
Easy come, easy go. So I ain't single.

465
00:39:10,593 --> 00:39:12,993
So I'm so dumb I got a wife
and a kid coming next month.

466
00:39:13,062 --> 00:39:15,428
So I'm nervous,
and my nerves is waltzing with my pulse.

467
00:39:15,498 --> 00:39:17,693
-Oh, pipe down.
-What do you mean, pipe down?

468
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:19,428
Ain't it permitted? No more free speech?

469
00:39:19,502 --> 00:39:22,869
Wait a minute. Come on, sit down.
Take it easy.

470
00:39:26,643 --> 00:39:30,545
Don't it matter if I wanna know whether
my kid's gonna be a boy or a girl or twins?

471
00:39:30,613 --> 00:39:32,604
Or like this fella says,
"Charity begins at home."

472
00:39:32,682 --> 00:39:34,775
Or don't it count no more, the home?

473
00:39:34,851 --> 00:39:37,581
Look, we know what's what.

474
00:39:38,187 --> 00:39:41,520
Guys like us killed on ships,
the fish pecking at our eyes.

475
00:39:41,591 --> 00:39:43,320
Who cares about us, anyway?

476
00:39:43,393 --> 00:39:45,190
Everybody's nuts
about the Army and Navy.

477
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:48,526
What are we supposed to be,
skeletons in a closet or something?

478
00:39:48,598 --> 00:39:51,431
Oh, yes,
and now they're gonna give us medals.

479
00:39:51,501 --> 00:39:52,627
Medals.

480
00:39:52,802 --> 00:39:54,895
Well, what good's a medal
when you're washed up on a beach

481
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:57,804
in a mess of seaweed?
Nobody even knows what you died for!

482
00:39:57,874 --> 00:40:01,173
So my kid can sing,
"My Daddy Lies Over The Ocean,"

483
00:40:01,411 --> 00:40:02,810
or under it?

484
00:40:06,449 --> 00:40:08,747
I wanna bounce my kid on my knee.

485
00:40:08,818 --> 00:40:10,786
I wanna be with my wife.
Go on, make a law against it.

486
00:40:10,853 --> 00:40:14,084
Put me in the nut-house
for thinking things like that.

487
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,454
Well, why don't you say something?

488
00:40:18,528 --> 00:40:20,519
You all dumb
because I spill what you're all thinking?

489
00:40:20,596 --> 00:40:22,359
I'm thinking plenty.

490
00:40:22,465 --> 00:40:24,490
And I ought to make you smell knuckles
for the duration.

491
00:40:24,567 --> 00:40:27,536
No, no, no.
You got your brains in your fists.

492
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,763
-But that's what he needs.
-No.

493
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,171
If that's the way you feel,
you got a right to say it.

494
00:40:32,241 --> 00:40:34,209
That's what we're fighting for.

495
00:40:34,277 --> 00:40:36,211
But you're seeing it cockeyed.

496
00:40:36,279 --> 00:40:39,373
You think the rest of us have got
nothing close to us, but our shirts?

497
00:40:39,449 --> 00:40:41,144
I got a family.

498
00:40:41,217 --> 00:40:43,344
You think my wife feels good
with me on the sea

499
00:40:43,419 --> 00:40:45,683
and my boy in England in the Air Force?

500
00:40:45,755 --> 00:40:48,087
-You got a boy in the Air Force?
-Yes.

501
00:40:48,157 --> 00:40:50,819
But why talk about such a common thing?

502
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,353
So you want a safe job, huh?

503
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:56,096
Go ask the Czechs and the Poles
and the Greeks.

504
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:57,860
They were figuring on safe jobs.

505
00:40:57,934 --> 00:41:01,665
They're lined up in front of guns,
digging each other's graves.

506
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:04,001
The trouble with you, Pulaski,

507
00:41:04,073 --> 00:41:07,634
is you think America is just a place
to eat and sleep.

508
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:11,976
You don't know what side
your future is buttered on. Believe...

509
00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:15,114
Don't waste your breath.

510
00:41:17,053 --> 00:41:19,521
What are you doing
wearing that union badge?

511
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:23,355
Twelve ABs, six ordinaries,
two electricians.

512
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,592
Hey, O'Hara, come on.
It's one of them new Liberty ships.

513
00:41:26,662 --> 00:41:28,755
I just got the dope.
They're signing on a full crew.

514
00:41:28,831 --> 00:41:30,958
-One bos'n.
-That's for me.

515
00:41:31,267 --> 00:41:32,734
One carpenter.

516
00:41:33,836 --> 00:41:37,363
Four oilers. Four firemen. Two wipers.

517
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,374
Have your cards ready.

518
00:41:39,442 --> 00:41:43,344
Please form in line. You'll be taken care of
by the numbers on your cards.

519
00:41:43,413 --> 00:41:46,507
She's one of them new babies.
A big wagon, and she's fast.

520
00:41:46,582 --> 00:41:49,745
Get in line, please. We'll take the ABs first.

521
00:41:53,723 --> 00:41:55,691
Here we go again, daddy!

522
00:41:57,026 --> 00:41:58,618
Look who's here.

523
00:41:59,996 --> 00:42:01,827
I guess I talk too much.

524
00:42:01,898 --> 00:42:04,867
-Welcome home, sweetheart.
-No hard feelings, huh?

525
00:42:04,934 --> 00:42:07,562
Why should there be any hard feelings?

526
00:42:08,704 --> 00:42:10,865
-Got a cigarette?
-Sure. Here.

527
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:22,645
Why...

528
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:26,420
-Well, I got you this time.
-Who's all this?

529
00:42:26,656 --> 00:42:27,816
It's Jenny, the wife.

530
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:30,916
I saw your fat face in a newsreel,
Mr. Alfred O'Hara.

531
00:42:30,993 --> 00:42:33,894
Here's an invitation for you, from a judge.

532
00:42:33,996 --> 00:42:35,293
Oh, listen now, Jenny.

533
00:42:35,364 --> 00:42:36,558
I've been having a tough time.

534
00:42:36,632 --> 00:42:38,691
I've been fighting sharks on a raft
for 11 days.

535
00:42:38,768 --> 00:42:41,601
Yeah? Did a blonde shark
spill that perfume on you?

536
00:42:41,671 --> 00:42:44,367
No, Jenny. That's the smell of the sea.

537
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:48,204
Yeah? Well, try smelling this for a change.

538
00:42:56,052 --> 00:42:58,748
Them Liberty boats are sure well-named.

539
00:43:08,164 --> 00:43:11,031
Many of you are being assigned
to active duty for the first time.

540
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,466
Others are being transferred to new ships.

541
00:43:13,536 --> 00:43:15,094
Some of you have faced the fire
of the enemy

542
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:17,105
and given a good account of yourself.

543
00:43:17,173 --> 00:43:20,438
Annapolis and West Point
have a long and glorious tradition.

544
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:23,741
This is a new school.
But you have a tradition, too.

545
00:43:23,813 --> 00:43:26,714
The oldest tradition
of any American service.

546
00:43:26,782 --> 00:43:29,114
American merchant ships,
carrying vital supplies

547
00:43:29,185 --> 00:43:31,949
to George Washington's army,
were largely responsible

548
00:43:32,021 --> 00:43:35,457
for our first victory as a free nation.
Remember that.

549
00:43:35,558 --> 00:43:39,153
Gentlemen, the future
of the United States Merchant Marine

550
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:40,920
is in your hands.

551
00:43:40,997 --> 00:43:42,521
Cadet Anderson.

552
00:43:49,272 --> 00:43:52,935
You're assigned to the <i>S.S. Roger Ames,</i>
Captain Gustafson. Good luck.

553
00:43:53,009 --> 00:43:54,203
-Smooth sailing.
-Thank you, sir.

554
00:43:54,277 --> 00:43:55,744
Cadet Parker.

555
00:43:57,013 --> 00:44:00,141
Cadet Parker,
you're assigned to the <i>S.S. Seawitch.</i>

556
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,510
She's a new ship with a famous old name.

557
00:44:02,585 --> 00:44:06,316
You already know the Captain.
Captain Jarvis. Good luck. Smooth sailing.

558
00:44:06,389 --> 00:44:07,583
Thank you, sir.

559
00:44:07,657 --> 00:44:08,919
Cadet Tierney.

560
00:44:13,963 --> 00:44:15,396
Joe Rossi here?

561
00:44:15,464 --> 00:44:18,297
-What do you want to see him about?
-I'd rather tell him that.

562
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:21,234
Oh, hiya, Steve. Come on in. Have a drink?

563
00:44:21,304 --> 00:44:22,635
No, thanks.

564
00:44:22,738 --> 00:44:25,400
You look worse than you did on the raft.

565
00:44:25,474 --> 00:44:27,135
Maybe. But I've had a lot more fun.

566
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,542
Honey, I want you to meet
a good friend of mine, Steve Jarvis.

567
00:44:29,612 --> 00:44:30,806
We've met.

568
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,108
Joe, I got a new ship.

569
00:44:32,181 --> 00:44:35,014
You're signed on as first,
providing you can report in half an hour.

570
00:44:35,084 --> 00:44:38,417
-And not in that uniform.
-You're not gonna go, Joe?

571
00:44:38,487 --> 00:44:40,717
Baby, I told you it was gonna be like this.

572
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:43,486
-It's an old story with Joe and me.
-Is it?

573
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:44,924
I'm always getting him aboard ship

574
00:44:44,994 --> 00:44:46,757
when he's tangled up
in something like this.

575
00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:49,855
-Something like what?
-Oh, don't mind him, Pearl.

576
00:44:49,932 --> 00:44:51,763
The old man of the sea.

577
00:44:51,834 --> 00:44:55,133
You may know a lot about ships, Steve,
but you don't know anything about people.

578
00:44:55,204 --> 00:44:58,537
I know you. She's different.
Everyone of them's different.

579
00:44:58,608 --> 00:45:01,543
-I've heard it in Cape Town, Rio, Bombay.
-That's right.

580
00:45:01,611 --> 00:45:02,771
-Where's your money?
-I have...

581
00:45:02,845 --> 00:45:05,109
-You got paid off in a lot of cash.
-Now wait a minute.

582
00:45:05,181 --> 00:45:08,617
We're not going out of here without it.
I've had experience. Hand it over.

583
00:45:08,684 --> 00:45:12,051
I'll tell you where his money is if you're so
anxious to know. He gave it to me.

584
00:45:12,121 --> 00:45:13,884
-Oh, he gave it to you?
-Yes, he did.

585
00:45:13,956 --> 00:45:16,720
-And we put it in the bank.
-We put it in the...

586
00:45:16,993 --> 00:45:18,688
How do you mean, we?

587
00:45:18,761 --> 00:45:21,730
Me and the wife, we got spliced yesterday.

588
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:26,691
Joe, why did you let me make
a fool of myself?

589
00:45:27,403 --> 00:45:31,271
-Excuse me, Mrs. Rossi. I'm very sorry.
-Oh, that's all right.

590
00:45:31,474 --> 00:45:34,602
-Joe, how'd it happen?
-Well, I don't know. You better ask her.

591
00:45:34,677 --> 00:45:37,578
I guess there's no reason
that makes any sense.

592
00:45:37,647 --> 00:45:39,342
I guess we just like each other.

593
00:45:39,415 --> 00:45:40,677
That makes a lot of sense.

594
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,274
Kind of hard to believe, ain't it?

595
00:45:42,351 --> 00:45:45,684
-Me, all hitched up with a missus?
-It's nice to believe it, Joe.

596
00:45:45,755 --> 00:45:48,588
You see, he can't go. He just can't.

597
00:45:48,658 --> 00:45:51,320
Baby, look, I gotta go.

598
00:45:51,627 --> 00:45:53,151
We'll sneak in a honeymoon
when I get back.

599
00:45:53,229 --> 00:45:56,562
Take you up to Niagara Falls if I don't get
tired of looking at water by that time.

600
00:45:56,632 --> 00:45:58,224
Joe, please.

601
00:45:58,301 --> 00:46:01,168
Baby, there's one thing
you gotta understand.

602
00:46:01,671 --> 00:46:04,731
Maybe we guys know more about
what's going on than most people.

603
00:46:04,807 --> 00:46:07,105
We've been hanging around Axis ports
for a long time,

604
00:46:07,176 --> 00:46:10,668
and we've seen what they do.
What we've seen ain't nice.

605
00:46:11,247 --> 00:46:15,479
So we can't sit around holding hands
with all that going on.

606
00:46:18,421 --> 00:46:20,389
Right with you, Skipper.

607
00:46:21,691 --> 00:46:23,921
I know how it is, Mrs. Rossi.

608
00:46:24,126 --> 00:46:26,321
I've been married for 20 years,

609
00:46:26,395 --> 00:46:29,193
and my wife feels just the same as you do.

610
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:30,961
Does she?

611
00:46:31,634 --> 00:46:34,933
She's had a lot of experience
being a sailor's wife.

612
00:46:35,304 --> 00:46:37,898
I'd like you to know her, Mrs. Rossi.

613
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,305
-I'd like to.
-I'll give you her telephone number.

614
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:44,376
I wish you'd call her.

615
00:46:44,613 --> 00:46:48,879
Maybe she'll tell you that I'm not always
as dumb as I was when I came in here.

616
00:46:48,951 --> 00:46:50,145
Thanks.

617
00:46:54,357 --> 00:46:56,655
I'll finish packing your things.

618
00:46:58,461 --> 00:47:01,430
I guess I'm not used to being
a sailor's wife.

619
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:04,224
-You better get used to it.
-I'll try.

620
00:47:06,035 --> 00:47:10,369
You know, it's a funny thing. I've been
saying goodbye to people all my life.

621
00:47:10,439 --> 00:47:12,964
This is the first time
it ever meant anything to me.

622
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:15,840
-That's why I married you, Joe.
-Huh?

623
00:47:17,179 --> 00:47:21,115
So you would have somebody
to say goodbye to and come back to.

624
00:47:22,485 --> 00:47:25,579
-That's what you wanted, isn't it, Joe?
-Yeah.

625
00:47:26,856 --> 00:47:29,347
Yeah, I guess that's what I wanted.

626
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:34,493
Oh, say,
do you mind if I take this with me?

627
00:47:34,997 --> 00:47:38,797
-That doesn't look like a sailor's wife.
-Oh, I think it does.

628
00:47:38,868 --> 00:47:41,769
I'll find you something
a little more homey.

629
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:49,734
Yeah, that'll do.

630
00:47:49,812 --> 00:47:51,871
I'm sorry that fellow's in it.

631
00:47:51,947 --> 00:47:54,780
-But I look nice, don't I?
-Yeah, he seems to think so.

632
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:57,478
-Who is the mug?
-Oh, it's nobody, Joe.

633
00:47:57,653 --> 00:47:59,951
I don't even remember his name.

634
00:48:03,826 --> 00:48:05,589
When'll you be back?

635
00:48:06,228 --> 00:48:07,695
I don't know.

636
00:48:07,797 --> 00:48:11,233
-Where you going?
-I'm sorry, they don't tell us that.

637
00:48:11,434 --> 00:48:13,629
Just someplace on the ocean?

638
00:48:13,969 --> 00:48:15,834
You can't sail on land.

639
00:48:16,705 --> 00:48:19,003
No place where I could write you?

640
00:48:19,475 --> 00:48:22,273
No, kid. I'm sorry, that's the way it is.

641
00:48:23,446 --> 00:48:25,004
It's all right.

642
00:48:26,715 --> 00:48:28,182
Goodbye, Joe.

643
00:48:30,453 --> 00:48:31,545
Yeah.

644
00:48:32,721 --> 00:48:34,450
Yeah, goodbye, kid.

645
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,629
All ready, Skipper.

646
00:48:47,002 --> 00:48:49,596
Well, goodbye, Mrs. Rossi.
Don't forget to call my wife.

647
00:48:49,672 --> 00:48:51,196
-I won't forget.
-I think you'll like her.

648
00:48:51,273 --> 00:48:53,173
I know she'll like you.

649
00:48:55,544 --> 00:48:57,603
Take care of yourself, kid.

650
00:49:00,015 --> 00:49:02,074
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

651
00:49:30,713 --> 00:49:32,340
All finished loading, Mr. Rossi.

652
00:49:32,414 --> 00:49:35,542
Sorry I gave you such a deck load,
but they need all they can get over there.

653
00:49:35,618 --> 00:49:37,643
You batten it down,
and we'll do our best to deliver it.

654
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,688
-Thank you, sir. Good luck.
-Thank you.

655
00:49:39,755 --> 00:49:42,280
Hey, can you imagine us tanker stiffs
on a ship like this?

656
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:45,225
Yeah. It's like being shacked up in heaven.

657
00:49:45,761 --> 00:49:47,388
-Feel that.
-You're telling me?

658
00:49:47,463 --> 00:49:50,125
Boy, oh, boy, am I gonna sleep tonight.

659
00:50:07,683 --> 00:50:09,150
Hello, chief.

660
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:11,083
Chief, I want you to meet the guys.

661
00:50:11,153 --> 00:50:15,112
That's Abrams, Pulaski and Cherub.
Boys, meet the chief.

662
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:17,681
-You gonna take that cat out to sea?
-Why not?

663
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,591
It's dangerous. She might get hurt.

664
00:50:19,662 --> 00:50:21,391
You don't even let her make up
her own mind.

665
00:50:21,463 --> 00:50:24,523
-Maybe she's got other plans.
-She's too young for that.

666
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,592
I'm gonna take care of her.
I ain't gonna let nothing happen to it.

667
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:29,604
You forget what happened
to Peaches the First?

668
00:50:29,672 --> 00:50:31,799
But Peaches was a lady,
and she couldn't swim.

669
00:50:31,874 --> 00:50:33,273
Now, this cat's different.

670
00:50:33,342 --> 00:50:35,139
You know the name I got for him?
Thomas.

671
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:36,438
But that don't give him no duck feet.

672
00:50:36,512 --> 00:50:39,003
But that's what I'm trying to tell you.
I've been educating him.

673
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:41,379
Each day I dunk him in a tub of water
and shove him around a bit.

674
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:43,179
And now, no kidding,
he can swim like a fish.

675
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:45,948
Besides, what's he got to worry about?
He's got nine lives, ain't he?

676
00:50:46,021 --> 00:50:47,818
How do you know he ain't used up
eight already?

677
00:51:18,387 --> 00:51:20,651
Why, hello, there, Admiral.
I didn't know you in those blues.

678
00:51:20,723 --> 00:51:21,781
How are you, sir?

679
00:51:21,857 --> 00:51:23,722
So you're shipping out
with the old man again, eh?

680
00:51:23,792 --> 00:51:26,192
Yes, sir. And I'm glad to be with him, too.
Of course, I don't know

681
00:51:26,261 --> 00:51:27,660
how he'll like it when he sees me.

682
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:29,288
You don't have to worry about that.

683
00:51:29,365 --> 00:51:32,960
Well, this isn't much like the old tanker,
is it? Even smells different.

684
00:51:33,035 --> 00:51:35,469
Sure does. It gives me a kick
to be on a new ship like this.

685
00:51:35,537 --> 00:51:36,799
Yes, it's quite a tub.

686
00:51:36,872 --> 00:51:39,466
Well, come along with me,
and I'll show you where to stow your gear.

687
00:51:39,541 --> 00:51:42,032
-Then I'll take you up to see the Captain.
-Well, thank you, sir.

688
00:51:44,279 --> 00:51:47,180
Another cadet just came aboard, sir.
That fills our complement.

689
00:51:47,249 --> 00:51:50,116
-What's he like?
-Well, he looks pretty good to me.

690
00:51:50,185 --> 00:51:53,279
Been torpedoed, spent a week on a raft,
and he's raring to go again.

691
00:51:53,355 --> 00:51:54,379
That's fine.

692
00:51:54,456 --> 00:51:57,448
We'll need them like that this trip.
Show him in.

693
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:02,893
Right this way, son.

694
00:52:05,601 --> 00:52:07,535
Reporting for duty, sir.

695
00:52:07,936 --> 00:52:08,698
Parker.

696
00:52:11,702 --> 00:52:13,670
-Glad to see you again.
-Thank you, sir.

697
00:52:13,738 --> 00:52:16,798
Hope we'll have better luck this time.
Get into your working clothes.

698
00:52:16,874 --> 00:52:19,138
-Plenty for you to do.
-Yes, sir.

699
00:52:25,483 --> 00:52:27,007
Parker again.

700
00:52:27,518 --> 00:52:30,385
Book-learning sailors
instead of experience.

701
00:52:31,155 --> 00:52:33,919
Well, I must admit, he did all right.

702
00:52:34,191 --> 00:52:37,524
You know, times change, Skipper,
and men and ships with it.

703
00:52:37,595 --> 00:52:39,790
Take this ship, for instance.

704
00:52:40,097 --> 00:52:42,031
-She's a fine one, mister.
-Yeah.

705
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:45,000
Why don't you get one?
You rate a master's license.

706
00:52:45,069 --> 00:52:47,731
You should have been on the bridge
of your own ship a long time ago.

707
00:52:47,805 --> 00:52:49,568
Oh, no. There's too much worrying
and paper work

708
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,629
goes with your job, Skipper.

709
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:53,575
I'd get all tangled up in that stuff
and choke myself to death.

710
00:52:53,644 --> 00:52:55,874
-Maybe you'll change your mind.
-Maybe.

711
00:52:55,947 --> 00:52:59,405
But they'll have to give me a secretary
to do all that.

712
00:53:03,521 --> 00:53:05,648
Oh, here's our gun crew now.

713
00:53:11,929 --> 00:53:13,396
Look at that.

714
00:53:17,601 --> 00:53:19,125
Ensign Wright and gun crew reporting, sir.

715
00:53:19,203 --> 00:53:22,229
Glad to have you with us, Mr. Wright.
My name's Rossi. First Officer.

716
00:53:22,306 --> 00:53:24,672
I guess you'd like to see the Captain.
I'll take you right up.

717
00:53:24,742 --> 00:53:26,073
Thank you.

718
00:53:26,477 --> 00:53:29,173
-Gee, she's a swell-looking ship.
-Yeah.

719
00:53:29,347 --> 00:53:31,577
I hear they got a new five-inch gun on her.

720
00:53:31,649 --> 00:53:34,618
-I hope we have a chance to use it.
-Maybe we'll get a little excitement.

721
00:53:34,685 --> 00:53:38,018
-Get a load of these guys.
-Holy mackerel. Hey, Sid.

722
00:53:42,226 --> 00:53:45,059
Look out. Make way for a sailor.

723
00:53:45,396 --> 00:53:47,523
-Why, they're just babies.
-Where's your nurses, kids?

724
00:53:47,598 --> 00:53:49,259
Ain't you children got the wrong ship?

725
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:51,164
This ain't no Coney Island outing,
you know.

726
00:53:51,235 --> 00:53:54,261
Look what they sent us for a gun crew.
The Navy must be running out of men.

727
00:53:54,338 --> 00:53:56,203
These guys are just pleading for trouble.

728
00:53:56,273 --> 00:53:58,036
Yeah. Anytime, anywhere.

729
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,667
We're here to protect you guys.

730
00:53:59,744 --> 00:54:02,907
They're here to protect us.
Now, ain't that sweet?

731
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:05,312
Hey, Mousie, come here a minute.

732
00:54:06,717 --> 00:54:08,514
-See that star he's got on his chest?
-Yeah.

733
00:54:08,586 --> 00:54:12,818
-You know what that means?
-Yeah. He got high marks in arithmetic.

734
00:54:13,657 --> 00:54:15,989
Hey, Mousie,
what was the last ship you were on?

735
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,585
-The <i>Lex.</i>
-He means the <i>Lexington.</i>

736
00:54:19,163 --> 00:54:20,755
The <i>Lexington.</i> Are you kidding?

737
00:54:20,831 --> 00:54:23,493
-Did you knock off any of them Japs, kid?
-Yeah, we got a few.

738
00:54:23,567 --> 00:54:25,626
-Yeah, but what battle was you in?
-I just enlisted.

739
00:54:25,703 --> 00:54:27,603
-"Enlisted."
-What did you do before you joined up?

740
00:54:27,671 --> 00:54:30,333
Oh, I had a couple of rackets.
I was selling neckties at cut-rate.

741
00:54:30,408 --> 00:54:32,399
-Neckties!
-Wrap me up a girdle.

742
00:54:32,476 --> 00:54:36,435
-With a blonde in it!
-All right, break it up, boys. Break it up.

743
00:54:38,649 --> 00:54:40,514
Mr. Wright, with your permission,
I'll have my men

744
00:54:40,584 --> 00:54:42,677
-show your boys to their quarters.
-Thank you, Mr. Rossi.

745
00:54:42,753 --> 00:54:44,516
Pulaski, and you, Whitey,
take these men aft.

746
00:54:44,588 --> 00:54:45,850
Yes, sir.

747
00:54:46,457 --> 00:54:47,788
This way, guys. Follow me.

748
00:54:47,858 --> 00:54:49,621
Come on, sea scouts.

749
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,501
They're taking them kind of young
these days, ain't they?

750
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:02,733
We're getting them young, Mr. Rossi.
We're not taking them.

751
00:55:02,873 --> 00:55:05,808
-Those boys all volunteered for this duty.
-Don't get me wrong, Ensign.

752
00:55:05,876 --> 00:55:08,003
I'm not objecting to their youth.
I'm all for it.

753
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:09,444
They've all been trained for this job.

754
00:55:09,513 --> 00:55:12,311
Yeah, well, I hope so, because
just between you and me, Mr. Wright,

755
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,783
I don't think my men
could hit the deck with their hats.

756
00:55:15,886 --> 00:55:17,251
All hands on deck.

757
00:55:17,321 --> 00:55:19,721
Stand by your lines, fore and aft.

758
00:55:20,624 --> 00:55:24,321
Okay, boys, stop shooting the breeze.
We're gonna shove off.

759
00:55:24,395 --> 00:55:26,056
Hey, Boats, where we heading for?

760
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:28,826
I don't know.
Cape Town, Algiers, Zanzibar.

761
00:55:28,899 --> 00:55:32,426
-Now, Zanzibar. There is a town.
-Any dames there, Boats?

762
00:55:51,455 --> 00:55:53,889
-Right rudder.
-Right rudder, sir.

763
00:55:56,594 --> 00:55:59,188
-Steady on the course, sir.
-Very well.

764
00:56:11,575 --> 00:56:15,204
-She handles like a sloop.
-Yes, sir. She's well-mannered.

765
00:56:31,395 --> 00:56:33,329
Periscope sighted directly astern!

766
00:56:33,397 --> 00:56:36,992
Scale, 1500. Range, 75.

767
00:56:37,067 --> 00:56:42,061
-Mark, mark, mark, mark!
-1500.

768
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,302
Ready One.

769
00:56:44,375 --> 00:56:47,037
-Range, 1800, no change.
-Ready, one.

770
00:56:48,045 --> 00:56:49,740
-Mark, mark!
-Set.

771
00:56:52,483 --> 00:56:54,917
-There ain't any subs.
-It's gunnery practice.

772
00:56:54,985 --> 00:56:58,113
That was pretty sloppy, boys.
It took you over 15 seconds.

773
00:56:58,189 --> 00:57:00,419
Let's try it again. Set. Range, 1800...

774
00:57:00,491 --> 00:57:01,958
If them kids are gonna handle them guns,

775
00:57:02,026 --> 00:57:05,052
I'm gonna pick me out a good seat
in the lifeboat, right now.

776
00:57:05,129 --> 00:57:06,619
Wait a minute.

777
00:57:09,066 --> 00:57:11,967
Weren't you men detailed by the Captain
to report here to learn gunnery?

778
00:57:12,036 --> 00:57:13,333
Well, we're here, ain't we?

779
00:57:13,504 --> 00:57:16,098
Well, it's very important that
you learn something about these guns,

780
00:57:16,173 --> 00:57:20,610
in the event that some of my boys
are knocked out during action. Come on.

781
00:57:22,012 --> 00:57:23,536
I want you to watch the loader.

782
00:57:23,614 --> 00:57:25,741
Parker, right over behind the trainer.

783
00:57:25,816 --> 00:57:28,785
You right over here by the pointer.
You right there.

784
00:57:29,587 --> 00:57:32,750
I want you fellows to watch my men
very closely. All right, men.

785
00:57:32,823 --> 00:57:36,122
Set, ready. Range, 1800. Scale, 69.

786
00:57:36,193 --> 00:57:39,162
Range, 1800. Scale, 69.

787
00:57:39,797 --> 00:57:41,264
Cease firing.

788
00:57:41,565 --> 00:57:43,829
So what's so tough about that?

789
00:57:43,901 --> 00:57:46,768
Mister, it took the Navy six months
to train these men.

790
00:57:46,837 --> 00:57:48,805
-That's a long time.
-I could do it in a week.

791
00:57:48,872 --> 00:57:50,703
-It would take you a year.
-Listen, buster...

792
00:57:50,774 --> 00:57:52,071
Hold it, Pulaski.

793
00:57:52,142 --> 00:57:54,167
Suppose you take the place of the man
you've been watching?

794
00:57:54,245 --> 00:57:58,375
-The rest of you fellows do the same.
-Here. This is gonna be good.

795
00:57:58,916 --> 00:58:03,410
Set, ready! Range, 2800. Scale, 35.

796
00:58:04,255 --> 00:58:05,279
Fire!

797
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:07,381
What do you mean, fire?
I ain't even got the door open.

798
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:09,892
-That's a breech.
-All right, breech. It ain't open, is it?

799
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,154
-Goldberg.
-Yes, sir.

800
00:58:11,228 --> 00:58:13,924
I'm detailing you to train these men
one hour a day.

801
00:58:13,998 --> 00:58:15,761
Aye, aye, sir. It'll be a pleasure.

802
00:58:15,833 --> 00:58:18,768
What'd you say your racket was
before you joined up, buddy?

803
00:58:18,836 --> 00:58:22,169
-You...
-Don't point that thing. It's for the gun.

804
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:23,797
All right, men, let's go!

805
00:58:23,874 --> 00:58:25,205
Mr. Rossi.

806
00:58:31,348 --> 00:58:32,906
These are our orders.

807
00:58:32,983 --> 00:58:35,178
Here's the Canadian port of assembly.

808
00:58:35,252 --> 00:58:37,049
We pick up the convoy here.

809
00:58:37,121 --> 00:58:39,316
-You've blocked the courses?
-Yes, sir.

810
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,052
And we take on more deck cargo
in Canada.

811
00:58:42,126 --> 00:58:45,152
If they put any more load on this ship,
we'll have to put wheels on her bottom

812
00:58:45,229 --> 00:58:46,821
and push her in.

813
00:59:13,757 --> 00:59:16,555
Pilot coming over the rail, sir.
There's a Navy lieutenant with him.

814
00:59:17,895 --> 00:59:21,729
I'm Captain Johnson. Pilot, sir.
I'll take her up to the moorings.

815
00:59:21,799 --> 00:59:25,496
This is Lieutenant Mclntosh
of the Royal Canadian Navy.

816
00:59:25,569 --> 00:59:28,197
My name is Jarvis.
This is my first officer, Mr. Rossi.

817
00:59:28,272 --> 00:59:30,866
Glad to know you.
How long will it take to get to our berths?

818
00:59:30,941 --> 00:59:33,569
We'll get through the nets and minefields
in about 45 minutes.

819
00:59:33,644 --> 00:59:36,408
Lieutenant Mclntosh is here to give you
any information you might want

820
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,538
about the convoy.

821
00:59:37,614 --> 00:59:39,741
The convoy commander presents
his compliments and asks

822
00:59:39,817 --> 00:59:42,377
-that you attend the conference.
-That's fine. She's all yours, Captain.

823
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:43,784
Thank you.

824
00:59:53,931 --> 00:59:56,559
Holy mackerel! The whole world's here.

825
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:09,711
Australia, Mexico, Cuba. See?

826
01:00:15,319 --> 01:00:16,547
Hiya, matey.

827
01:00:35,105 --> 01:00:38,597
That's something you never seen
in your 30 years at sea.

828
01:00:40,911 --> 01:00:45,644
We're going to live to sail them right into
Wilhelmshaven and Hamburg and Bremen.

829
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:52,580
I was told to report
for a convoy conference.

830
01:00:52,656 --> 01:00:54,647
-Inside, sir.
-Thank you.

831
01:00:54,958 --> 01:00:57,586
This is the number of your ship, sir.

832
01:01:01,432 --> 01:01:03,696
Captain Jarvis of the <i>Seawitch.</i>

833
01:01:06,804 --> 01:01:09,932
-This is the number of your ship, sir.
-Thank you.

834
01:01:10,607 --> 01:01:12,131
Captain Jarvis.

835
01:01:12,843 --> 01:01:15,505
Ziemer. Man, but it's good to see you.

836
01:01:15,579 --> 01:01:17,376
Good to see you.

837
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:19,812
-Rotterdam, 1940.
-Yeah.

838
01:01:20,417 --> 01:01:22,977
I'll never forget that evening I spent
with you and <i>Frau</i> Ziemer

839
01:01:23,053 --> 01:01:25,783
-and the family.
-I don't forget, either.

840
01:01:28,058 --> 01:01:30,788
I read what the Nazis did to Rotterdam.

841
01:01:31,061 --> 01:01:34,224
You mustn't give up hope.
They're safe somewhere.

842
01:01:34,698 --> 01:01:35,722
No.

843
01:01:36,533 --> 01:01:40,902
From my ship in the harbor I look to
the Zeelandstraat where my house is,

844
01:01:40,971 --> 01:01:42,939
and I see Stukas diving.

845
01:01:43,273 --> 01:01:45,969
I see flames and smoke and ruin.

846
01:01:47,344 --> 01:01:49,005
They are not safe.

847
01:01:49,646 --> 01:01:51,773
Some day it'll all be over.

848
01:01:51,849 --> 01:01:55,808
Then we'll be able to sit once more
in your garden by the canal.

849
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,417
Attention.

850
01:02:05,929 --> 01:02:08,295
Gentlemen, I wish to introduce
the convoy commander,

851
01:02:08,365 --> 01:02:09,730
who will preside at this conference.

852
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,529
Rear Admiral Hartridge,
United States Navy.

853
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:14,901
Thank you, gentlemen, carry on.
Captain Williams, my operations officer,

854
01:02:14,972 --> 01:02:16,997
will give you the details.

855
01:02:17,808 --> 01:02:21,869
Each of you has been given a slip of paper
which contains the number of his ship.

856
01:02:23,146 --> 01:02:26,274
The ships of this convoy,
designated as Convoy 211,

857
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:29,547
will put to sea at the respective times
marked in the sealed orders

858
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,588
to be given you
at the close of this meeting.

859
01:02:31,655 --> 01:02:35,386
You will also receive your codes, ciphers
and zig-zag plans

860
01:02:35,459 --> 01:02:39,122
from Lieutenant Commander Brown
at the end of this meeting.

861
01:02:39,429 --> 01:02:42,887
Immediately upon weighing anchor,
each ship will display her number

862
01:02:42,966 --> 01:02:46,424
by a hoist of flags
of the International Signal Code.

863
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:49,295
You will proceed directly
to the point of rendezvous

864
01:02:49,373 --> 01:02:53,139
and assume your positions,
as shown by this diagram.

865
01:02:54,244 --> 01:02:58,772
Our convoy is made up of 73 vessels,
not including the naval escort.

866
01:02:59,049 --> 01:03:00,880
In order to maintain your position,

867
01:03:00,951 --> 01:03:04,682
you have only to match your number
with those of the ships around you.

868
01:03:04,755 --> 01:03:06,723
Let's take a number at random.

869
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:09,588
-Number 28.
-Why, that's my number.

870
01:03:09,927 --> 01:03:14,626
The numbers of the ships abeam of you
must be 27 and 29.

871
01:03:15,198 --> 01:03:18,497
And the numbers of the ships
forward and astern of you

872
01:03:18,569 --> 01:03:21,868
must be 18 and 38, respectively.

873
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:24,607
Now, let's move
to the other end of the line.

874
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:26,575
Number 21.

875
01:03:26,643 --> 01:03:29,305
-That's me.
-This is your position, Captain.

876
01:03:29,947 --> 01:03:33,178
Your normal stations
will be 500 yards apart.

877
01:03:33,717 --> 01:03:37,209
The command will carry
the signal number 00.

878
01:03:37,287 --> 01:03:40,381
She should be watched for signals
at all times.

879
01:03:40,457 --> 01:03:43,221
Are there any questions, gentlemen?
Yes, Captain?

880
01:03:43,293 --> 01:03:46,751
-Do we use only flags for communication?
-No, Captain.

881
01:03:47,497 --> 01:03:50,261
We will use five means of communication.

882
01:03:50,467 --> 01:03:55,200
Blinker light, rocket, whistle, flag
and when practical, loudspeaker.

883
01:03:55,272 --> 01:03:59,072
But absolute radio silence
must be maintained at all times.

884
01:03:59,142 --> 01:04:00,541
Yes, Captain?

885
01:04:00,911 --> 01:04:04,176
What means of communication do we use
if we lose contact with each other,

886
01:04:04,247 --> 01:04:06,977
-or if we're forced to scatter?
-None.

887
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:10,679
In the event that we are forced to scatter,
you will proceed to a new rendezvous

888
01:04:10,754 --> 01:04:14,019
at a time and place
indicated in your sealed orders.

889
01:04:14,091 --> 01:04:17,583
Are there any further questions,
gentlemen?

890
01:04:19,896 --> 01:04:21,261
Gentlemen,

891
01:04:22,265 --> 01:04:25,359
I do not need to emphasize the hazards
you're likely to encounter.

892
01:04:25,435 --> 01:04:27,164
You all know the efforts
the enemy is making

893
01:04:27,237 --> 01:04:30,104
to cut the lifeline of Allied supplies.

894
01:04:30,173 --> 01:04:32,641
Most of us are strangers here.

895
01:04:32,709 --> 01:04:35,678
Our vessels fly the flags of many nations.

896
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:39,614
But we will know each other better
after this trip.

897
01:04:39,916 --> 01:04:41,850
Good luck and Godspeed.

898
01:04:42,252 --> 01:04:45,346
Thank you, gentlemen.
I will see you at our destination.

899
01:06:22,519 --> 01:06:25,010
All the ships are clearing the harbor
very handily, Admiral.

900
01:06:25,088 --> 01:06:26,919
I doubt if there'll be much delay
at the rendezvous.

901
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:29,857
Good. Signal the escort force
to commence screening operations.

902
01:06:29,926 --> 01:06:30,950
Aye, aye, sir.

903
01:06:31,027 --> 01:06:33,621
Mr. Burk, signal the escort force
to commence screening operations.

904
01:06:33,697 --> 01:06:36,860
Aye, aye, sir.
Signal, pennant four, William. Jig easy.

905
01:06:36,933 --> 01:06:38,366
Pennant four, William. Jig easy.

906
01:06:38,435 --> 01:06:41,404
On the searchlight.
Signal, pennant four, William. Jig easy.

907
01:06:41,471 --> 01:06:43,462
-William.
-Jig easy.

908
01:06:55,585 --> 01:07:00,318
Coastal patrol to convoy commander.
Coastal patrol to convoy commander.

909
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:02,688
This is where we leave you.

910
01:07:02,759 --> 01:07:04,090
Good luck.

911
01:07:22,279 --> 01:07:24,747
-Our sealed orders opened yet?
-They are.

912
01:07:24,815 --> 01:07:26,544
-Ten minutes ago.
-Where we headed?

913
01:07:26,616 --> 01:07:29,346
-Russia, port of Murmansk.
-Murmansk?

914
01:07:29,419 --> 01:07:32,820
-Well, this trip ain't gonna be no picnic.
-Never has been.

915
01:07:32,889 --> 01:07:34,083
I guess the only thing that's important

916
01:07:34,157 --> 01:07:36,125
is to get that stuff to Russia
as quick as possible.

917
01:07:36,193 --> 01:07:37,785
That's right, mister.

918
01:07:37,861 --> 01:07:40,625
Make yourself and all the officers
acquainted with those orders.

919
01:07:40,697 --> 01:07:41,686
Yes, sir.

920
01:07:57,247 --> 01:07:59,909
<i>Number 31. Number 31.</i>

921
01:07:59,983 --> 01:08:04,352
<i>Porthole uncovered on your stern.</i>
<i>Black it out or we'll machine gun it.</i>

922
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:49,264
What a day. What a day.

923
01:08:49,332 --> 01:08:52,768
So rough out there, even the fish
are trying to get out from under.

924
01:08:52,836 --> 01:08:54,303
Yeah.

925
01:08:54,838 --> 01:08:56,897
You know, this is the kind of a day
I'd like to be home

926
01:08:56,973 --> 01:08:59,567
-with a blonde and a book.
-Since when can you read?

927
01:08:59,643 --> 01:09:01,941
-Who said I could read?
-But you said...

928
01:09:22,732 --> 01:09:23,960
Parker?

929
01:09:24,768 --> 01:09:27,202
-Yes, sir. Skipper want me, sir?
-No.

930
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:29,067
No, I was just surprised
to see you sitting up.

931
01:09:29,139 --> 01:09:32,700
-You better turn in.
-I was trying to, but I couldn't make it.

932
01:09:33,076 --> 01:09:34,373
Sit down.

933
01:09:37,113 --> 01:09:38,944
Now, these nights are killers, aren't they?

934
01:09:39,015 --> 01:09:41,711
Yeah, I lie in my bunk with my clothes on
and try to sleep,

935
01:09:41,785 --> 01:09:45,186
but every time that engine slows down,
my heart speeds up.

936
01:09:45,255 --> 01:09:48,782
In time, I think I can train myself
to have an iron nerve like you have.

937
01:09:48,858 --> 01:09:52,157
Let me tell you something
about my iron nerve, son.

938
01:09:52,228 --> 01:09:53,991
It's made of rubber,
just like everybody else's,

939
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:55,998
so it'll stretch when you need it.

940
01:09:56,066 --> 01:10:00,332
You know, people got a funny idea
that being brave is not being scared.

941
01:10:00,403 --> 01:10:02,667
But I don't know. I always figured

942
01:10:02,739 --> 01:10:05,367
that if you weren't scared,
there was nothing to be brave about.

943
01:10:05,442 --> 01:10:08,536
The trick is,
how much scaring you can take.

944
01:10:08,611 --> 01:10:11,978
-I got an idea you can take plenty.
-I hope so.

945
01:10:12,382 --> 01:10:14,577
-Oh, that's your girl?
-Yes, sir.

946
01:10:14,651 --> 01:10:16,642
Well, she's nice-looking.

947
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:19,188
-What's her name?
-Emily Jordan.

948
01:10:19,255 --> 01:10:21,416
We want to get married,
but we've got to wait

949
01:10:21,491 --> 01:10:24,051
till I get my third mate's papers.

950
01:10:24,127 --> 01:10:26,061
You're young enough to wait.

951
01:10:26,129 --> 01:10:29,360
-How'd she feel about your going to sea?
-Well, she didn't feel good.

952
01:10:29,432 --> 01:10:31,059
Same as my wife.

953
01:10:31,134 --> 01:10:34,228
Here. Take a squint of this.

954
01:10:37,273 --> 01:10:40,401
-Say, she looks swell.
-Yeah.

955
01:10:41,211 --> 01:10:44,977
Yeah, we didn't have time to have
a real good picture taken.

956
01:10:45,048 --> 01:10:46,572
You know, it's kind of nice to have
somebody at home

957
01:10:46,649 --> 01:10:48,913
-thinking about you, ain't it?
-Yeah.

958
01:10:49,753 --> 01:10:52,085
How'd you ever happen
to join the Merchant Marine?

959
01:10:52,155 --> 01:10:54,180
That's what I wanted to do
even when I was a kid.

960
01:10:54,257 --> 01:10:56,623
I guess I've read everything
written about ships.

961
01:10:56,693 --> 01:10:58,923
Dana, Conrad, Marriott, Melville.

962
01:10:58,995 --> 01:11:01,589
I never got around to reading that stuff.
I've been too busy doing it.

963
01:11:01,664 --> 01:11:04,758
It seems to me like the toughest,
most important job anybody can do.

964
01:11:04,834 --> 01:11:07,667
-Both for now and after the war.
-You're right, son.

965
01:11:07,737 --> 01:11:11,138
There's no job bigger than this.
Let me tell you something.

966
01:11:11,207 --> 01:11:13,573
No matter how many planes and tanks
and guns you pile up,

967
01:11:13,643 --> 01:11:14,871
no matter how many men you got,

968
01:11:14,944 --> 01:11:17,845
it doesn't mean a thing, unless the men
get the stuff when they need it.

969
01:11:17,914 --> 01:11:20,041
That's your job and my job
to see that they get it.

970
01:11:20,116 --> 01:11:21,777
Gee, Mr. Rossi,
when you have your own ship,

971
01:11:21,851 --> 01:11:24,081
I hope I have a chance to sail with you.

972
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:27,146
I'm afraid I'm a little too easygoing
to be a skipper.

973
01:11:27,223 --> 01:11:29,316
Well, you better turn in
before you go on watch.

974
01:11:29,392 --> 01:11:31,292
-Good night.
-Good night, sir.

975
01:11:46,042 --> 01:11:49,534
Fog bank dead ahead!

976
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:54,172
Fog bank dead ahead!

977
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:02,956
It's getting thicker every minute.

978
01:12:03,026 --> 01:12:05,654
If it gets much thicker,
we'll have to chop our way through it.

979
01:12:05,728 --> 01:12:06,990
-Parker?
-Yes, sir.

980
01:12:07,063 --> 01:12:10,191
-Take a man aft and rig the towing spar.
-Aye, aye, sir.

981
01:12:16,606 --> 01:12:18,073
Come on, let's get this spar overboard

982
01:12:18,141 --> 01:12:19,972
before that ship back there climbs our tail.

983
01:12:20,043 --> 01:12:22,238
I wish we had one of these
sticking over the side.

984
01:12:22,312 --> 01:12:25,042
-What for?
-To keep that Dutch ship off us.

985
01:12:25,115 --> 01:12:28,983
I don't want no 10,000 tons of TNT
smacking me in the kisser.

986
01:12:29,052 --> 01:12:31,577
You got nothing to worry about.
He's just as scared as we are.

987
01:12:31,654 --> 01:12:33,679
-I don't know. Ready?
-Heave.

988
01:12:55,044 --> 01:12:57,444
Spar dead ahead!

989
01:12:57,514 --> 01:13:00,745
-Slow her down five turns.
-Slow her down five turns.

990
01:13:03,987 --> 01:13:06,217
<i>Mac, slow her down five turns.</i>

991
01:13:06,289 --> 01:13:07,950
What's the matter?
Have you got fog up there?

992
01:13:08,024 --> 01:13:10,015
Thicker than your skull.

993
01:13:27,076 --> 01:13:29,271
-Ship close aboard! Port beam !
-Hard right!

994
01:13:29,345 --> 01:13:30,710
Hard right, sir.

995
01:13:37,887 --> 01:13:41,379
Wake up, you dumb son of a sail fish.
You dead or gone blind?

996
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,591
-Hard right!
-Wheel's hard right.

997
01:13:45,662 --> 01:13:48,290
Ship swinging right all the time, sir.

998
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:08,942
Well, we've just missed
some nice fireworks.

999
01:14:09,652 --> 01:14:10,641
Whew.

1000
01:14:20,563 --> 01:14:22,224
Well, Brown, it's a relief to get clear

1001
01:14:22,298 --> 01:14:23,959
and have so many
of the convoy astern of us.

1002
01:14:24,033 --> 01:14:26,593
Yes, Admiral. Signal force reports
practically all ships in sight.

1003
01:14:26,669 --> 01:14:28,159
Good.

1004
01:14:29,272 --> 01:14:34,005
<i>All ships resume your positions.</i>
<i>Take normal distance and intervals.</i>

1005
01:14:38,881 --> 01:14:40,974
Check the number
of those ships, Mr. Rossi.

1006
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:44,315
-Yes, sir.
<i>-All ships resume your positions.</i>

1007
01:14:44,387 --> 01:14:46,685
<i>Take normal distance and intervals.</i>

1008
01:14:53,763 --> 01:14:56,561
There's that old Dutch tub
right abeam of us.

1009
01:14:56,633 --> 01:14:57,759
They're all over the place.

1010
01:14:57,834 --> 01:15:00,769
Looks like they'll have to
shuffle the pack and deal again.

1011
01:16:00,897 --> 01:16:02,831
-Signal attack formation.
-Aye, aye, sir.

1012
01:16:02,899 --> 01:16:05,094
From convey commander to 371 and 406.

1013
01:16:05,168 --> 01:16:07,102
371 to convoy commander. Go ahead.

1014
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:09,400
Room 406 to convoy commander.
Go ahead.

1015
01:16:09,472 --> 01:16:12,566
Search and attack submarines
on starboard quarter of convoy.

1016
01:16:12,642 --> 01:16:14,633
All engines ahead, flank speed.

1017
01:16:20,983 --> 01:16:22,382
Back to your stations.

1018
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:24,209
Sound general alarm.

1019
01:16:25,755 --> 01:16:28,815
All hands on the board deck.
Set out your fire equipment.

1020
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:05,794
This attack may be a decoy.

1021
01:17:05,995 --> 01:17:07,860
Have the rest of the escort
remain on station.

1022
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:09,693
The main attack may come
from another quarter.

1023
01:17:09,766 --> 01:17:11,290
Aye, aye, sir.

1024
01:17:25,581 --> 01:17:28,049
On the searchlight.
Emergency pennant. Dog. King.

1025
01:17:28,117 --> 01:17:30,017
Emergency pennant. Dog. King.

1026
01:18:06,322 --> 01:18:09,814
Periscope two points abaft the port beam.

1027
01:18:10,626 --> 01:18:14,118
-Signal 308 submarine's position.
-Aye, aye, sir.

1028
01:18:14,931 --> 01:18:16,057
Convoy commander to 308.

1029
01:18:16,132 --> 01:18:18,100
From 308 to convoy commander.
Go ahead.

1030
01:18:18,167 --> 01:18:20,727
Periscope two points abaft
of port beam of flagship.

1031
01:18:20,803 --> 01:18:22,270
Distance, 1,400 yards.

1032
01:18:22,338 --> 01:18:24,602
-Left full rudder, Quartermaster.
-Aye, aye, sir. Left full rudder.

1033
01:18:24,674 --> 01:18:25,834
All engines ahead and flank speed.

1034
01:19:09,886 --> 01:19:12,320
Thirty-eight seconds,
let go your first charge.

1035
01:19:12,388 --> 01:19:14,583
Aye, aye, sir. Thirty-eight seconds.

1036
01:19:15,491 --> 01:19:17,959
-Stand clear of the depth charge racks.
-Stand clear of the racks.

1037
01:19:18,027 --> 01:19:19,119
Stand clear of the racks!

1038
01:19:19,195 --> 01:19:21,857
-Let go number one.
-Let go number one, sir.

1039
01:19:22,598 --> 01:19:24,395
Number one gone!

1040
01:19:26,769 --> 01:19:28,236
Number one gone.

1041
01:19:29,539 --> 01:19:32,975
-Brown, signal the convoy to disperse.
-Aye, aye, sir. One pennant. Easy cast.

1042
01:19:33,042 --> 01:19:35,909
-Signalman, one pennant, easy cast. Hit it.
-Aye, aye, sir.

1043
01:19:35,978 --> 01:19:37,775
-Fire dispersal rocket.
-Aye, aye, sir.

1044
01:19:37,847 --> 01:19:40,042
-Stand by to fire your rocket.
-Ready with the rocket, sir.

1045
01:19:40,116 --> 01:19:41,105
Fire.

1046
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:31,323
-Looks like the Nazis are all around us.
-We've run into a wolf pack.

1047
01:21:13,376 --> 01:21:14,843
That depth charge brought him up.

1048
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:17,777
After gun, train on target off port quarter.

1049
01:21:26,155 --> 01:21:29,215
If this keeps up,
somebody's gonna get hurt around here.

1050
01:21:31,927 --> 01:21:34,589
Forward gun.
Submarine on starboard bow.

1051
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:08,494
Control. New target on starboard beam.
Concentrate all guns.

1052
01:22:10,633 --> 01:22:13,101
Come right 20 degrees. We'll ram her.

1053
01:22:21,877 --> 01:22:24,038
There's one they won't have to ram.

1054
01:22:40,129 --> 01:22:42,689
-Grades 1650. No change.
-Ready.

1055
01:22:45,234 --> 01:22:46,667
That one had his name on it,

1056
01:22:46,736 --> 01:22:49,830
for the little one
with the moustache, Schickelgruber.

1057
01:22:52,041 --> 01:22:53,303
Oh, we did it.

1058
01:22:55,377 --> 01:22:58,676
-Scratch one sea skunk.
-Come left and steady up on 290.

1059
01:22:58,748 --> 01:23:01,216
Come left and steady up on 290, sir.

1060
01:23:26,075 --> 01:23:28,373
Torpedo three points of starboard bow,
1,000 yards.

1061
01:23:28,444 --> 01:23:30,435
-We're going sky-high.
-Rudder amidship.

1062
01:23:30,513 --> 01:23:33,744
-Rudder amidship, sir.
-Turn your guns to starboard.

1063
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:42,821
So long, baby.

1064
01:23:43,392 --> 01:23:45,826
-That was close, sir.
-Yeah.

1065
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:16,990
Break out one of the cargo booms,
put a sling on this bomber

1066
01:24:17,059 --> 01:24:19,254
-and get it in place.
-Aye, aye, sir.

1067
01:24:22,031 --> 01:24:26,058
Four men with lines!
Over the side and secure those chains.

1068
01:24:26,135 --> 01:24:27,295
If we ever get to Murmansk,

1069
01:24:27,369 --> 01:24:29,098
I'm gonna buy me a barrel of vodka
and get stinking.

1070
01:24:29,171 --> 01:24:31,696
You better get two, then you'll have one.

1071
01:25:47,416 --> 01:25:50,180
You know, it's a funny thing,

1072
01:25:50,252 --> 01:25:53,744
now that it's all over,
my corns is burning like a house afire.

1073
01:25:53,822 --> 01:25:56,256
You got more sense in your feet
than you got in your head.

1074
01:25:56,325 --> 01:25:59,624
-At least your feet know we're in trouble.
-What're you beefing about now?

1075
01:25:59,695 --> 01:26:01,925
Well, what chance have we got here
all alone in the North Atlantic?

1076
01:26:01,997 --> 01:26:04,158
They can pick us off here
like a duck in a barrel.

1077
01:26:04,233 --> 01:26:06,258
Well, the convoy's gonna
get together again.

1078
01:26:06,335 --> 01:26:08,735
-Who says so?
-They got it all fixed.

1079
01:26:08,804 --> 01:26:10,931
They got one of them things
like you have with dames.

1080
01:26:11,006 --> 01:26:15,102
-What things?
-You know, a fellow and a dame.

1081
01:26:15,177 --> 01:26:16,576
Yeah, the...

1082
01:26:16,645 --> 01:26:17,703
A guy's been going with a dame

1083
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:19,372
for a long time,
then he don't see her for a long time.

1084
01:26:19,448 --> 01:26:22,076
Then he... Then they get together again.

1085
01:26:23,419 --> 01:26:25,649
Rendezvous.

1086
01:26:26,588 --> 01:26:30,490
Abrams, get your tail off that deck.
You're not parked in the bleachers!

1087
01:26:30,559 --> 01:26:33,756
Pulaski, get the lead out of your breeches.
This is no Bronx picnic.

1088
01:26:33,829 --> 01:26:36,889
Aye, aye, sir.
Who does he think he is, Simon Legree?

1089
01:26:37,566 --> 01:26:38,931
Go on with this...

1090
01:28:20,469 --> 01:28:22,334
Hey, take a look at that.

1091
01:28:23,338 --> 01:28:25,636
-What do you make of it?
-It's a sub.

1092
01:28:25,707 --> 01:28:27,470
-Mr. Wright!
-Yes, sir.

1093
01:28:27,543 --> 01:28:29,773
Off the port quarter.

1094
01:28:29,845 --> 01:28:31,642
That's a U-boat all right.

1095
01:28:31,713 --> 01:28:34,079
She's out of range.
She's playing tag and we're it.

1096
01:28:34,149 --> 01:28:36,709
-Hard right, Quartermaster!
-Hard right, sir.

1097
01:29:02,244 --> 01:29:05,338
Now, gentlemen, as you know,
a submarine's been tailing us for hours.

1098
01:29:05,414 --> 01:29:08,144
I deliberately changed my course
to lead them away from the convoy.

1099
01:29:08,217 --> 01:29:11,482
You know what that means?
We can't rejoin. We're on our own.

1100
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,483
Mr. Wright, it looks as if you and your men

1101
01:29:13,555 --> 01:29:15,147
will have that chance
you've been waiting for.

1102
01:29:15,224 --> 01:29:18,785
The sub's keeping out of range, sir,
because she doesn't want to match guns.

1103
01:29:18,861 --> 01:29:21,955
I think she'll dog us till night, submerge
and then attack.

1104
01:29:22,030 --> 01:29:23,258
Maybe.

1105
01:29:23,332 --> 01:29:24,731
Mr. McGonigle,

1106
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,394
if you've a couple of extra knots
up your sleeve, I want them right now.

1107
01:29:27,469 --> 01:29:28,959
I'll try, sir.

1108
01:29:29,037 --> 01:29:30,595
We can't expect any help.

1109
01:29:30,672 --> 01:29:33,038
Our first job is
to shake that sub off our tail.

1110
01:29:33,108 --> 01:29:36,134
Our next is to beat our way to Murmansk
and deliver the goods.

1111
01:29:36,211 --> 01:29:38,577
With God's help,
that's what we intend to do.

1112
01:29:38,647 --> 01:29:40,740
Mr. Rossi, double your watch
and be ready for any emergency.

1113
01:29:40,816 --> 01:29:41,805
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Thank you, gentlemen.

1114
01:29:41,884 --> 01:29:43,181
Aye, sir.

1115
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:53,026
I wonder what them guys in the sub
are thinking about.

1116
01:29:53,095 --> 01:29:55,325
They're Nazis. They don't think.

1117
01:29:55,397 --> 01:29:57,627
What do you mean,
"They're Nazis. They don't think"?

1118
01:29:57,699 --> 01:30:01,658
Don't kid yourself. They think all right.
Wanna know what they're thinking about?

1119
01:30:01,737 --> 01:30:05,673
About us. About this ship.
They're thinking about knocking us off.

1120
01:30:05,741 --> 01:30:07,208
I can't understand it.

1121
01:30:07,276 --> 01:30:09,972
There's a sub following us,
and my feet don't hurt.

1122
01:30:10,045 --> 01:30:12,741
-Mr. Wright?
-Yes, sir.

1123
01:30:12,814 --> 01:30:14,475
What can we expect?

1124
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:17,280
After dark, he'll probably pick up speed
to get ahead of us,

1125
01:30:17,352 --> 01:30:19,286
and stay with us to pick up the convoy.

1126
01:30:19,354 --> 01:30:22,050
Any case,
he'll let us have one before dawn.

1127
01:30:22,124 --> 01:30:24,092
Anything we can do
to put your guns in range?

1128
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:26,286
No. If we slow down, he will, too.

1129
01:30:26,562 --> 01:30:29,531
-It'll be dark in another hour.
-Yeah.

1130
01:30:30,632 --> 01:30:34,124
It's gonna be a black night and a long one.

1131
01:31:37,399 --> 01:31:40,095
-She seems to be coming up a little.
-Yeah.

1132
01:31:40,168 --> 01:31:43,660
-Why not throw a shot at her?
-No, she's too far out of range.

1133
01:31:43,739 --> 01:31:46,970
-One round will keep them away.
-I'll try one, sir.

1134
01:31:47,042 --> 01:31:50,478
After gun,
be ready to fire on target off port quarter.

1135
01:31:50,545 --> 01:31:54,003
<i>Range, 8,000. Scale, 95.</i>

1136
01:31:54,082 --> 01:31:55,071
Fire!

1137
01:32:25,013 --> 01:32:28,107
I figure in about two hours
they'll be abeam of us.

1138
01:32:28,183 --> 01:32:29,480
Yes, sir.

1139
01:32:31,453 --> 01:32:33,478
We've got a lot of waiting to do.

1140
01:32:34,856 --> 01:32:36,949
-How's your pulse, kid?
-I'm okay, sir.

1141
01:32:37,025 --> 01:32:39,550
There's not much of a chance
of getting away from them, is there?

1142
01:32:39,628 --> 01:32:41,493
No way that I know of.

1143
01:32:41,563 --> 01:32:42,894
If we run, they'll follow us.

1144
01:32:42,964 --> 01:32:44,898
If we stop, they'll spot us
with their listening devices,

1145
01:32:44,966 --> 01:32:47,196
if there's anything to listen...

1146
01:32:49,071 --> 01:32:52,131
Parker, have the Chief Engineer report
to me in the Chart Room on the double.

1147
01:32:52,207 --> 01:32:53,469
Aye, aye, sir.

1148
01:32:56,812 --> 01:32:58,677
Hey, Cap, you know
it's only going to be a short time

1149
01:32:58,747 --> 01:33:01,511
-before that sub comes up abeam of us.
-I know that, mister.

1150
01:33:01,583 --> 01:33:03,141
I've asked the Chief Engineer
to come up here

1151
01:33:03,218 --> 01:33:05,550
to find out if it's possible to turn off
every piece of machinery.

1152
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:08,054
-Cut out every sound.
-To beat the sub's sound detector?

1153
01:33:08,123 --> 01:33:10,455
Well, we've got to.
They can pick up anything.

1154
01:33:10,525 --> 01:33:12,390
-You mean secure the boilers?
-Yeah.

1155
01:33:12,461 --> 01:33:14,588
It's the only way
I could think of to lose that pig boat.

1156
01:33:14,663 --> 01:33:16,893
-Oh, in here, Mac.
-Did you send for me, sir?

1157
01:33:16,965 --> 01:33:18,933
Chief, can you black out
every sound onboard?

1158
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,865
Pumps, circulators,
generators, everything.

1159
01:33:20,936 --> 01:33:22,927
-The whole plan.
-I can,

1160
01:33:23,004 --> 01:33:25,165
but I won't be responsible
for the safety of the ship.

1161
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:26,867
Will you be responsible
for the safety of the ship

1162
01:33:26,942 --> 01:33:29,035
if we get struck with a torpedo amidships?

1163
01:33:29,111 --> 01:33:30,942
How long will it take you
to secure everything?

1164
01:33:31,012 --> 01:33:32,673
-Ten minutes.
-Can you get steam up again

1165
01:33:32,748 --> 01:33:34,409
-in half an hour?
-Yes, sir.

1166
01:33:34,483 --> 01:33:36,781
-It's worth the risk. Go ahead.
-Aye, sir.

1167
01:33:36,852 --> 01:33:39,047
Mr. Rossi, check the wind
and estimate the drift.

1168
01:33:39,121 --> 01:33:40,179
Pass the word along to the bos'n.

1169
01:33:40,255 --> 01:33:42,485
I want complete silence
throughout the ship.

1170
01:33:42,557 --> 01:33:43,546
Aye, sir.

1171
01:34:20,562 --> 01:34:24,157
Everything's secure, sir.
All we gotta do now is wait.

1172
01:34:30,672 --> 01:34:32,697
-I wish I was in Times Square.
-Why?

1173
01:34:33,074 --> 01:34:34,837
I'd take a subway home.

1174
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,953
There you are, baby.

1175
01:34:47,022 --> 01:34:50,082
Stay put, and for crying out loud,
don't make no noise.

1176
01:36:27,722 --> 01:36:30,782
I tell you, there's no sub around.
My corns don't hurt.

1177
01:36:31,192 --> 01:36:33,683
Do you know what I'm doing
when this is over?

1178
01:36:33,762 --> 01:36:36,560
I'm putting into port,
I'm getting off the ship

1179
01:36:36,631 --> 01:36:40,123
and putting an oar on my shoulder,
and I'm starting inland.

1180
01:36:40,201 --> 01:36:43,170
And the first time a guy says to me,
"What's that on your shoulder?",

1181
01:36:43,238 --> 01:36:45,706
that's where I'm settling
for the rest of my life.

1182
01:36:45,774 --> 01:36:47,674
-Shut up!
-Hey, pipe down.

1183
01:38:09,257 --> 01:38:12,749
I think we've got something out there.

1184
01:38:13,495 --> 01:38:15,360
Do you hear it?

1185
01:38:17,265 --> 01:38:20,200
Sounds like she's about
a half mile off our stern.

1186
01:38:20,268 --> 01:38:21,633
Yeah.

1187
01:38:21,703 --> 01:38:25,469
My heart is pounding so fast
it's gonna bust right out of my chest.

1188
01:38:25,540 --> 01:38:26,939
Take it easy, kid.

1189
01:38:54,602 --> 01:38:57,036
I'm gonna tie a knot in that cat's neck
and toss it overboard.

1190
01:38:57,105 --> 01:38:58,572
Wait a minute, guy.

1191
01:39:41,983 --> 01:39:45,384
I can't hear it right now. She's gone.

1192
01:39:45,453 --> 01:39:48,945
There's no telling.
They may have blacked out, too.

1193
01:39:51,126 --> 01:39:52,718
We'll drift till dawn.

1194
01:41:41,769 --> 01:41:43,532
All clear, mister?

1195
01:41:44,772 --> 01:41:46,501
All clear here, sir.

1196
01:41:46,975 --> 01:41:49,535
-Portside, what do you see?
-All clear, sir.

1197
01:41:49,611 --> 01:41:52,171
-Can't pick up a thing.
-Very well.

1198
01:41:52,247 --> 01:41:54,442
Mr. Wright, check with the crow's nest.

1199
01:41:54,515 --> 01:41:56,608
Crow's nest, everything clear out there?

1200
01:41:56,684 --> 01:41:58,242
-All clear, sir.
-Good.

1201
01:41:58,319 --> 01:42:01,117
<i>Chief, I'll expect full boilers</i>
<i>in a half an hour.</i>

1202
01:42:01,189 --> 01:42:03,749
I'll give you all the steam you need
in half an hour, sir,

1203
01:42:03,825 --> 01:42:07,158
and maybe before that.
Light off both boilers.

1204
01:42:07,228 --> 01:42:10,720
Get the fires
under both boilers right away.

1205
01:42:28,383 --> 01:42:30,715
It sure feels swell to be moving again.

1206
01:42:30,785 --> 01:42:32,810
It sure was like sailing
a ghost ship last night.

1207
01:42:35,256 --> 01:42:36,484
Listen.

1208
01:42:39,294 --> 01:42:41,421
-Listen to what?
-Them engines.

1209
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:44,223
Don't they sound good?

1210
01:42:44,299 --> 01:42:45,493
Don't do that, Pulaski.

1211
01:42:45,566 --> 01:42:48,501
My ears are still sticking out
from all the listening I did last night.

1212
01:42:48,569 --> 01:42:49,729
How do you like that?

1213
01:42:49,804 --> 01:42:52,068
Don't you know you just scared me
out of two years' growth?

1214
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:53,903
And at my age, that ain't so good.

1215
01:42:53,975 --> 01:42:58,139
I felt like cheering when the sun came up,
and that stinking sub wasn't around.

1216
01:42:58,446 --> 01:43:00,311
It feels nice and warm in here.

1217
01:43:00,381 --> 01:43:01,814
What's the matter, kid? You're not eating?

1218
01:43:01,883 --> 01:43:03,441
Oh, I ain't hungry.

1219
01:43:03,518 --> 01:43:05,713
No wonder he ain't hungry,
with this belly wash.

1220
01:43:05,787 --> 01:43:07,345
-This what?
-Belly wash. That's what I said,

1221
01:43:07,422 --> 01:43:09,049
and that's because I'm polite.

1222
01:43:09,123 --> 01:43:11,751
If it ain't the mines, it's the subs.
If it ain't the subs, it's the bombs.

1223
01:43:11,826 --> 01:43:14,260
If it ain't the bombs,
it's this arsenic this guy gives us for grub.

1224
01:43:14,329 --> 01:43:17,457
-You ought to be charged with murder.
-Why don't you dry up?

1225
01:43:17,532 --> 01:43:19,022
Don't pay any attention to him, Cookie.

1226
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:21,261
We're all at a point where
we're gonna bite off each other's heads.

1227
01:43:21,336 --> 01:43:23,497
I nearly bit my own off last night.

1228
01:43:24,072 --> 01:43:27,098
What's the matter... Don't tell me
your feet're hurting you again.

1229
01:43:27,175 --> 01:43:30,167
-No, it's my head.
-Well, that's okay with me.

1230
01:43:30,445 --> 01:43:31,935
Just so it ain't his feet.

1231
01:43:32,013 --> 01:43:34,413
Now, wait a minute. This may be serious.

1232
01:43:34,682 --> 01:43:37,549
-Just how bad does your head hurt?
-Oh, very bad. Very bad.

1233
01:43:37,618 --> 01:43:40,280
It's a funny thing, I can't understand it.
I hardly ever have a headache.

1234
01:43:40,355 --> 01:43:41,754
You shouldn't eat so much
with a headache.

1235
01:43:41,823 --> 01:43:43,950
Why not? It don't go to my head.

1236
01:43:44,926 --> 01:43:46,223
Anything else hurt?

1237
01:43:46,294 --> 01:43:48,262
-Yes, my...
-Never mind.

1238
01:44:49,357 --> 01:44:50,824
You hear that?

1239
01:45:04,572 --> 01:45:06,972
May be Russian planes
coming out to meet us.

1240
01:45:07,041 --> 01:45:09,874
May be,
but that's Norway off to starboard.

1241
01:45:46,147 --> 01:45:48,115
Unidentified planes off the starboard bow.

1242
01:45:48,249 --> 01:45:49,841
Aircraft sighted.

1243
01:45:51,419 --> 01:45:53,478
-Where away?
-Starboard bow.

1244
01:45:53,955 --> 01:45:56,287
Altitude approximately 10 to 15.

1245
01:46:00,928 --> 01:46:03,294
Unidentified planes,
two points off starboard bow.

1246
01:46:03,364 --> 01:46:05,127
Sound general alarm.

1247
01:46:05,766 --> 01:46:07,495
Sound general alarm.

1248
01:46:10,838 --> 01:46:13,432
Anti-aircraft batteries track target.

1249
01:46:39,467 --> 01:46:40,866
Nazi planes.

1250
01:46:41,002 --> 01:46:42,936
They're enemy planes, sir.

1251
01:46:43,004 --> 01:46:44,266
Get that guy down out of the crow's nest.

1252
01:46:44,338 --> 01:46:46,135
Crow's nest. Come on down out of there.

1253
01:46:46,207 --> 01:46:48,471
Engine room. Stand by for maneuvers.

1254
01:46:48,576 --> 01:46:50,066
Aye, aye, sir.

1255
01:46:59,687 --> 01:47:01,279
-Tight right.
-Left.

1256
01:47:35,456 --> 01:47:38,789
We'll con the ship from the wheelhouse.
Get the Quartermaster below. Steer 40.

1257
01:47:38,859 --> 01:47:40,793
Get below.
Steer 40 and signal when you're ready.

1258
01:47:40,861 --> 01:47:41,850
Aye, aye, sir.

1259
01:48:14,996 --> 01:48:16,930
-We got one.
-We got him.

1260
01:48:17,365 --> 01:48:18,992
-We got it.
-We got it.

1261
01:48:46,894 --> 01:48:49,829
Get to shelter, Skipper. They're strafing.

1262
01:49:01,876 --> 01:49:04,538
-Where'd it get you, Steve?
-In the leg.

1263
01:49:04,779 --> 01:49:07,111
-Take over, Joe.
-All right, boys. Take him to his cabin.

1264
01:49:07,181 --> 01:49:08,443
Yes, sir.

1265
01:49:16,590 --> 01:49:18,615
Forward gun. Forward gun.

1266
01:49:18,793 --> 01:49:22,160
Our system's dead.
Parker, go forward. On the double.

1267
01:50:01,135 --> 01:50:03,365
Get back there. I'll load her.

1268
01:50:08,075 --> 01:50:09,804
Here he comes again, spitting.

1269
01:50:09,877 --> 01:50:11,777
We'll spit right back at him.

1270
01:50:18,152 --> 01:50:20,052
He'll never come back.

1271
01:50:22,289 --> 01:50:23,551
Look out.

1272
01:50:41,375 --> 01:50:44,139
Mr. Rossi. Give me a hand here, will you?

1273
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:47,271
Here, Mr. Rossi.

1274
01:50:48,482 --> 01:50:50,382
Right here, Mr. Wright.

1275
01:50:57,625 --> 01:51:00,321
-Well done, Parker.
-Thank you, sir.

1276
01:51:01,529 --> 01:51:03,360
Need another man here.

1277
01:51:05,733 --> 01:51:07,462
Yeah, just take it easy.

1278
01:51:19,413 --> 01:51:22,007
How many of these do you want, Steve?

1279
01:51:22,116 --> 01:51:23,378
Just one.

1280
01:51:26,153 --> 01:51:28,053
Here you are, Skipper.

1281
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:36,587
-What's the condition of the ship?
-She's still afloat.

1282
01:51:36,664 --> 01:51:38,461
Can you keep her afloat?

1283
01:51:38,532 --> 01:51:41,330
We got to. You're in no condition to swim.

1284
01:51:41,502 --> 01:51:43,493
What about the men?

1285
01:51:44,538 --> 01:51:46,733
I'll tell you about that later, Steve.

1286
01:51:46,807 --> 01:51:48,001
Parker?

1287
01:51:51,011 --> 01:51:54,242
Later, Steve.
I'll give you a full report later.

1288
01:51:54,482 --> 01:51:57,110
Now, this is gonna sting a little bit.

1289
01:51:59,854 --> 01:52:02,823
Oh, close those ports. Let's get that lamp.

1290
01:52:10,764 --> 01:52:12,391
A little higher.

1291
01:52:13,434 --> 01:52:16,699
Just hold that leg down tight.
Don't let it move.

1292
01:52:17,505 --> 01:52:19,905
Well, here we go, Steve.
I'm gonna start digging.

1293
01:52:19,974 --> 01:52:22,340
All right. Go for it.

1294
01:52:29,750 --> 01:52:33,277
As a surgeon you're a great first mate.

1295
01:52:37,157 --> 01:52:39,250
-Did you get it?
-Yeah.

1296
01:52:45,199 --> 01:52:47,531
Oh, hand me that bottle of sulfur.

1297
01:52:47,601 --> 01:52:50,161
That brown bottle there. That's right.

1298
01:52:54,441 --> 01:52:58,036
-I think you'll be all right now, Steve.
-Thank you, Joe.

1299
01:53:07,855 --> 01:53:09,880
How do you feel now, Steve?

1300
01:53:09,957 --> 01:53:11,390
Better, Joe.

1301
01:53:12,393 --> 01:53:15,157
So you got a ship of your own, after all.

1302
01:53:15,529 --> 01:53:19,932
-You are the Skipper from now on.
-I'll try to take care of her for you.

1303
01:53:27,641 --> 01:53:29,632
I'll look in on you later.

1304
01:53:33,881 --> 01:53:37,612
-How's the Captain?
-Well, we'll know better in a few hours.

1305
01:53:44,491 --> 01:53:47,756
-Have you got Parker's things packed yet?
-Almost finished, sir.

1306
01:53:47,828 --> 01:53:49,693
Stow them in my cabin
when you get through.

1307
01:53:49,763 --> 01:53:53,096
We'll send them back to his folks
in Kansas, when we get to the States.

1308
01:53:53,167 --> 01:53:55,727
It ain't much for them to get back.

1309
01:54:06,714 --> 01:54:08,272
What about these?

1310
01:54:08,349 --> 01:54:12,115
I'll take them. They're to his girl.
He told me about her.

1311
01:54:15,723 --> 01:54:17,418
-Is that her?
-Yeah.

1312
01:54:25,165 --> 01:54:28,965
Oh, here's one that ain't finished yet.

1313
01:54:30,738 --> 01:54:34,367
-I didn't mean to, Mr. Rossi, but I read it.
-That's okay.

1314
01:54:35,342 --> 01:54:37,310
It's got things in there,

1315
01:54:37,611 --> 01:54:41,377
like where he says he was so scared
he couldn't sleep nights.

1316
01:54:41,849 --> 01:54:43,817
That's the way we all feel.

1317
01:54:43,884 --> 01:54:48,082
But he says it was okay on account
of he has confidence in us, the crew.

1318
01:54:48,155 --> 01:54:51,818
-He was a good kid.
-Yeah, and I used to ride him all the time.

1319
01:54:51,892 --> 01:54:53,154
He made a fine officer.

1320
01:54:55,829 --> 01:54:58,423
Do you mean that he used to study
all these books?

1321
01:54:58,499 --> 01:55:01,400
Well, you gotta learn it
one way or another.

1322
01:55:04,738 --> 01:55:07,036
Mr. Rossi, do you mind
if I borrow a couple of these?

1323
01:55:07,107 --> 01:55:09,405
I don't think Parker will mind.

1324
01:55:09,677 --> 01:55:12,578
Report on deck
when you get his gear stowed.

1325
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:17,141
If you work hard enough, maybe you can
wear one of those some day.

1326
01:55:27,361 --> 01:55:29,693
All ready for the service, Steve.

1327
01:55:29,763 --> 01:55:31,560
I wish I could do it for you, Joe.

1328
01:55:31,632 --> 01:55:34,430
I think you better mark in the book
the parts that I'm to read.

1329
01:55:34,501 --> 01:55:36,025
I've done that.

1330
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:43,076
"I am the resurrection, and the life,"
says the Lord.

1331
01:55:43,243 --> 01:55:47,407
"He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

1332
01:55:48,582 --> 01:55:52,109
"And whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die."

1333
01:55:55,055 --> 01:55:59,389
"We brought nothing into this world,
and it is certain we can carry nothing out."

1334
01:55:59,626 --> 01:56:02,993
"The Lord gave,
and the Lord hath taken away;

1335
01:56:03,897 --> 01:56:06,331
"blessed be the name of the Lord."

1336
01:56:06,767 --> 01:56:08,826
Now that's the word of God.

1337
01:56:09,470 --> 01:56:10,960
And it's good.

1338
01:56:11,805 --> 01:56:14,706
I don't think He'd mind if I put my oar in.

1339
01:56:15,309 --> 01:56:19,268
These are eight men we knew and liked,
guys like us.

1340
01:56:20,147 --> 01:56:23,241
Guys we ate with and slept with
and fought with.

1341
01:56:25,219 --> 01:56:28,677
Well, we were just a little luckier
than they were.

1342
01:56:30,991 --> 01:56:33,255
We'll miss them. All of them.

1343
01:56:34,194 --> 01:56:36,628
Gunner's Mate, First-class,
Michael Ahearn.

1344
01:56:36,697 --> 01:56:39,291
Gunner's Mate, Second-class,
Frank Rosetti.

1345
01:56:39,366 --> 01:56:43,632
Apprentice Seaman, Maurice Goldberg.
Able Seaman, George Anderson.

1346
01:56:43,804 --> 01:56:47,706
Able Seaman, William Ordinski.
Able Seaman, John Murphy.

1347
01:56:48,342 --> 01:56:50,367
Able Seaman, Henry Boehn.

1348
01:56:51,912 --> 01:56:55,279
And Cadet Ezra Parker.

1349
01:56:57,451 --> 01:57:02,047
I guess I knew Parker a little better
than the others. He came from Kansas.

1350
01:57:02,689 --> 01:57:07,524
He had a girl. All the ocean he ever knew
was in a mud-hole,

1351
01:57:07,594 --> 01:57:09,585
but he had to go to sea.

1352
01:57:09,830 --> 01:57:12,731
Well, we're giving them all
a good send-off.

1353
01:57:13,333 --> 01:57:15,130
It's too bad their folks ain't here to see it,

1354
01:57:15,202 --> 01:57:18,000
'cause I know they'd feel better about it.

1355
01:57:18,572 --> 01:57:20,597
I'm sorry they had to die.

1356
01:57:21,775 --> 01:57:25,074
I'm sorry they didn't get a chance
to live out their lives,

1357
01:57:25,145 --> 01:57:28,911
so they could've finished the things
they started out to do.

1358
01:57:30,150 --> 01:57:32,118
But those are the breaks.

1359
01:57:33,253 --> 01:57:34,982
Any one of us could be
lying here tomorrow,

1360
01:57:35,055 --> 01:57:38,149
and somebody reads a book over us,

1361
01:57:38,225 --> 01:57:40,693
and we're tossed in the sea.

1362
01:57:42,129 --> 01:57:44,461
But that ain't what's important.

1363
01:57:44,765 --> 01:57:48,098
A lot more people are gonna die
before this is over,

1364
01:57:48,802 --> 01:57:51,566
and it's up to the ones that come through

1365
01:57:52,239 --> 01:57:55,106
to make sure
that they didn't die for nothing.

1366
01:57:56,577 --> 01:57:59,637
Now, will you men join me
in the Lord's Prayer?

1367
01:58:00,247 --> 01:58:02,681
"Our Father, who art in Heaven,

1368
01:58:02,850 --> 01:58:06,752
"Hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come,

1369
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:10,847
"Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

1370
01:58:11,225 --> 01:58:14,126
"Give us this day our daily bread.

1371
01:58:14,194 --> 01:58:16,560
"And forgive us our trespasses,

1372
01:58:16,864 --> 01:58:20,163
"as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1373
01:58:20,234 --> 01:58:24,466
"And lead us not into temptation.
But deliver us from evil. Amen."

1374
01:58:31,345 --> 01:58:34,212
"We therefore commit his body
to the deep,

1375
01:58:34,281 --> 01:58:37,648
"looking for the general Resurrection
in the last day,

1376
01:58:37,718 --> 01:58:40,949
"and the life of the world to come,
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

1377
01:58:41,021 --> 01:58:44,320
"at whose second coming
in glorious majesty to judge the world,

1378
01:58:44,391 --> 01:58:45,790
"the sea shall give up her dead;

1379
01:58:45,859 --> 01:58:50,353
"and the corruptible bodies of those
who sleep in him shall be changed,

1380
01:58:50,530 --> 01:58:52,794
"and made like
unto his own glorious body;

1381
01:58:52,866 --> 01:58:56,597
"whereby he is able to subdue all things
unto himself."

1382
01:59:04,711 --> 01:59:08,977
Yeah, I wish we'd run into
some good, dirty, stinking fog.

1383
01:59:09,616 --> 01:59:11,948
That would help keep them away.

1384
01:59:12,819 --> 01:59:16,152
-How's your forward gun, Mr. Wright?
-Pretty bad shape. We're patching her up.

1385
01:59:16,223 --> 01:59:17,588
The attacks are okay, though.

1386
01:59:17,658 --> 01:59:20,354
Keep working on that gun.
We may need it.

1387
01:59:20,494 --> 01:59:21,961
How's it below, chief?

1388
01:59:22,029 --> 01:59:24,793
Plates are none too good.
Propeller shaft took the line.

1389
01:59:24,865 --> 01:59:26,492
How much speed can you make?

1390
01:59:26,566 --> 01:59:28,227
Less than half of what
you've been getting.

1391
01:59:28,302 --> 01:59:29,929
About six knots.

1392
01:59:31,738 --> 01:59:35,037
-How's your cargo?
-Can't take much more of a beating, sir.

1393
01:59:35,208 --> 01:59:38,735
Pardon the suggestion, mister,
but why don't we head for Scotland?

1394
01:59:38,812 --> 01:59:40,575
We could pick up a convoy there.

1395
01:59:40,647 --> 01:59:43,741
And I'm telling you, a trip to perdition
would be like a pleasure cruise

1396
01:59:43,817 --> 01:59:46,251
compared to what we are going under.

1397
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:49,312
-No, we'll hold our course. Smoke?
-Thank you.

1398
01:59:51,124 --> 01:59:52,614
Thank you, sir.

1399
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:55,458
Now don't worry, Mac. We'll make it.

1400
01:59:55,529 --> 01:59:57,463
I hope so. I can't swim.

1401
01:59:58,665 --> 01:59:59,962
Light, sir?

1402
02:00:04,204 --> 02:00:07,571
-Another match, please.
-What's the matter, you superstitious?

1403
02:00:07,641 --> 02:00:10,610
No, but I do not like to tempt Providence.

1404
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:36,164
Looks like they got us in number one hold.

1405
02:00:37,371 --> 02:00:39,498
There's a hole forward, sir,
you can drive a tank through.

1406
02:00:39,573 --> 02:00:42,940
Break out all the gasoline and oil you got,
spread it amidships and set fire to it.

1407
02:00:43,010 --> 02:00:44,500
Aye, aye, sir.

1408
02:00:45,712 --> 02:00:47,475
Mac, what's the damage down there?

1409
02:00:47,547 --> 02:00:50,641
Making water, sir.
We've started the bilge pump.

1410
02:00:50,751 --> 02:00:53,413
-We can keep her under control.
-All right. Keep operating.

1411
02:00:53,487 --> 02:00:55,182
And send a man forward
to secure the bulkhead.

1412
02:00:55,255 --> 02:00:57,450
All hands to the cargo winch.

1413
02:00:58,992 --> 02:01:00,755
Turn your guns to starboard
and hold your fire.

1414
02:01:00,827 --> 02:01:02,522
Bring out those fire buckets,
throw out the sand,

1415
02:01:02,596 --> 02:01:05,156
fill them with gas and oil, spread them
in the forward deck and light it.

1416
02:01:05,232 --> 02:01:07,530
What? Has he gone crazy?
What's he want to burn the ship up for?

1417
02:01:07,601 --> 02:01:08,898
Trying to bring that sub to the surface.

1418
02:01:08,969 --> 02:01:10,561
Mac, come here with me.

1419
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:16,066
If they think we're sinking,
they won't waste a torpedo on us.

1420
02:01:16,143 --> 02:01:17,770
They may surface.

1421
02:01:24,184 --> 02:01:26,209
Stand by here to break out this fire hose!

1422
02:01:26,286 --> 02:01:28,186
Stand by the fire hose.

1423
02:01:33,393 --> 02:01:35,588
Engine room. Let oil into the boiler fires.

1424
02:01:35,662 --> 02:01:38,222
<i>-I want a smoke screen.</i>
-We'll give it to you, mister.

1425
02:01:38,298 --> 02:01:40,823
Open up three, five and seven oil valves.

1426
02:01:44,771 --> 02:01:46,534
Radio room, send out S.O.S.

1427
02:01:46,606 --> 02:01:49,404
We're abandoning ship,
and don't believe it.

1428
02:02:02,889 --> 02:02:04,720
Look. She's surfacing.

1429
02:02:07,494 --> 02:02:09,655
-Hard right!
-Hard right, sir.

1430
02:02:09,729 --> 02:02:11,924
Rudder hard right.
Ship swinging right all the time, sir.

1431
02:02:11,998 --> 02:02:14,762
-Steady as you go!
-Steady as she goes, sir.

1432
02:03:13,026 --> 02:03:16,928
-Where do you think we hit her?
-That's a job for a glass-bottom boat.

1433
02:03:16,997 --> 02:03:19,124
<i>What's going on here, Mr. Rossi?</i>

1434
02:03:19,199 --> 02:03:20,757
Why doesn't anyone report to me?

1435
02:03:20,834 --> 02:03:22,461
Steve, you remember
when the old tanker burned,

1436
02:03:22,536 --> 02:03:24,060
and the Nazis rammed our lifeboat?

1437
02:03:24,137 --> 02:03:26,867
And you swore you'd find them
and slice them like a piece of cheese?

1438
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:28,771
Don't leave the bridge,
and I'll talk to you later.

1439
02:03:28,842 --> 02:03:30,332
Aye, aye, sir.

1440
02:03:32,312 --> 02:03:36,146
Bos'n! Get that fire out. Get a move on.

1441
02:03:36,449 --> 02:03:38,144
You wanna go into Murmansk
looking like a tramp?

1442
02:03:45,458 --> 02:03:49,155
-How many more days to Murmansk?
-Oh, a couple, maybe three.

1443
02:03:49,362 --> 02:03:52,024
I keep pinching myself to see if I'm alive.

1444
02:03:52,098 --> 02:03:54,999
Keep pinching, will you?
We ain't there yet.

1445
02:04:01,508 --> 02:04:02,770
Hey, look.

1446
02:04:06,713 --> 02:04:08,476
I think they're on our side!

1447
02:04:08,548 --> 02:04:10,209
Famous last words.

1448
02:04:19,059 --> 02:04:21,118
No, they're ours all right.

1449
02:04:21,194 --> 02:04:23,856
Russian planes on the starboard quarter!

1450
02:04:48,788 --> 02:04:50,813
You sure you can make it?

1451
02:04:50,924 --> 02:04:55,054
I'll be on that bridge if Chips has to build
a frame to hold me up.

1452
02:05:03,136 --> 02:05:06,264
-How do you like that? Nice, huh?
-A regular Rembrandt.

1453
02:05:06,339 --> 02:05:08,739
You know, if we keep knocking off Nazis
like this,

1454
02:05:08,808 --> 02:05:11,504
they'll be commissioning us into the Navy.

1455
02:05:11,611 --> 02:05:13,545
The <i>U.S.S. Seawitch.</i>

1456
02:05:13,613 --> 02:05:15,706
Yes, sir. That's us.

1457
02:05:28,094 --> 02:05:29,618
It's a miracle.

1458
02:05:30,030 --> 02:05:33,693
That isn't a miracle.
It's American seamanship.

1459
02:05:48,515 --> 02:05:52,952
-That's a great welcome for you, Joe.
-Not for me, Cap. It's for the ship.

1460
02:05:54,354 --> 02:05:56,345
Put your heaving line on the dock!

1461
02:06:07,267 --> 02:06:11,727
-Hey, what does that mean, <i>'"tovarisch '"?</i>
-That means, "comrade." That's good.

1462
02:06:12,472 --> 02:06:14,099
Comrade, comrade.

1463
02:06:21,514 --> 02:06:25,006
That's the first time I ever wanted to kiss
a longshoreman.

1464
02:06:28,154 --> 02:06:29,815
What's wrong, Joe?

1465
02:06:31,057 --> 02:06:33,491
I'm just thinking about the trip back.

1466
02:06:35,628 --> 02:06:39,086
<i>From the freedom-Ioving peoples</i>
<i>of the United Nations</i>

1467
02:06:39,332 --> 02:06:42,358
<i>to our merchant seaman on all the oceans</i>

1468
02:06:42,435 --> 02:06:44,903
<i>goes our everlasting gratitude.</i>

1469
02:06:45,739 --> 02:06:50,642
<i>With their aid, we shall build</i>
<i>a bridge of ships to our allies,</i>

1470
02:06:50,910 --> 02:06:54,311
<i>over which we will roll</i>
<i>the implements of war.</i>

1471
02:06:54,681 --> 02:06:56,205
<i>We shall see to it</i>

1472
02:06:56,282 --> 02:06:59,217
<i>that men and materials will be delivered</i>

1473
02:06:59,686 --> 02:07:02,917
<i>where they are needed</i>
<i>and when they are needed.</i>

1474
02:07:03,056 --> 02:07:05,718
<i>Nothing on land, in the air,</i>

1475
02:07:05,792 --> 02:07:09,159
<i>on the sea, or under the sea</i>

1476
02:07:09,229 --> 02:07:13,290
<i>shall prevent our complete</i>
<i>and final victory.</i>

1477
