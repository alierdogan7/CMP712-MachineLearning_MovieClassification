1
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,190
Wake up, God damn it!

2
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:32,527
I know it's hard.

3
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:36,572
Your eyes is burning,
slowly opening.

4
00:01:36,656 --> 00:01:39,992
You slowly realizing
that this wasn't no dream.

5
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:41,994
No, this is your life.

6
00:02:28,703 --> 00:02:32,957
Yeah, right about now you're looking
at them cold walls that surround you,

7
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,419
and you wondering,
"How the hell did I get up in this joint, Jack?

8
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,088
"And how the fuck
I'm gonna get out?"

9
00:02:54,018 --> 00:02:55,770
(BUZZING)

10
00:03:00,107 --> 00:03:03,360
But you know what they say:
"It's like life, y'all.

11
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:06,071
PETEY ON P.
A...: "Ain't no way to it, but to do it."

12
00:03:07,364 --> 00:03:11,242
So reach on up there and scratch
another day off the wall, man.

13
00:03:11,326 --> 00:03:13,161
But don't be whining.

14
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:14,328
Uh-uh.

15
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:16,789
Ain't gonna be no signal fire.

16
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:18,499
Just take a stand.

17
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:20,251
Be a man.
It's good to see you, man.

18
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,628
And try to understand.
Hey, listen, man. Listen.

19
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:24,671
You ain't in here
'cause of the master's plan.

20
00:03:24,713 --> 00:03:27,007
No, you in here
'cause you fucked up!

21
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,678
Look, this is the nigga that I've been writing you about.
You dig?

22
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:34,889
Yo, I was reading my court
papers the other day, y'all.

23
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:40,394
They say, "Ralph Waldo 'Petey' Greene
versus the United States of America."

24
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:43,897
I say, "Goddamn!
No wonder I'm up in this motherfucker!"

25
00:03:45,232 --> 00:03:48,485
So I'm gonna dedicate
this next one to my baby.

26
00:03:49,402 --> 00:03:53,031
Man, she gonna be up here in a minute,
and this gal, Lord have mercy,

27
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:54,907
she's fine as frogs, yeah.

28
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:58,828
So while this is playing,
I want y'all to think about the one y'all love.

29
00:03:58,911 --> 00:04:00,913
And I'm talking about the one
sends you them pictures, man,

30
00:04:00,996 --> 00:04:03,248
not the cat in the next bunk.

31
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,752
I guess you're pretty hard up
for entertainment around here.

32
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:08,878
Yeah, man. This is prison.

33
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:11,756
Whatever gets you through
twenty-to-life.

34
00:04:16,052 --> 00:04:17,678
I got a meeting.

35
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:20,139
You...

36
00:04:23,308 --> 00:04:25,602
You need anything?
I don't need shit.

37
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:26,812
Okay.

38
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:30,815
Let me ask you something.
Why do you even bother?

39
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:32,901
Because I promised Mama.

40
00:04:36,153 --> 00:04:38,447
Don't do me no fucking favors.

41
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,133
(BUZZING)

42
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,429
Hello, Vernell.

43
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,394
That's the booty line.

44
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,313
Conjugal visits.

45
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,650
(VERNELL EXCLAIMING)

46
00:05:23,363 --> 00:05:26,575
Hay. Hey, Radio man! Hey!

47
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:30,328
So Milo been telling you
about me, huh?

48
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,496
What?

49
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:33,956
Milo. Your brother?

50
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,876
Said y'all need a new DJ
at that radio station.

51
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:38,502
Hey, I'm your man.

52
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:40,504
My brother wouldn't know.

53
00:05:40,546 --> 00:05:43,715
And in case you forgot,
you're in prison.

54
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:45,133
It's a minor challenge.

55
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:46,760
You're a miscreant.

56
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:49,804
That's more than
a minor challenge.

57
00:05:49,888 --> 00:05:51,848
The fuck this nigga call me?
A Miss who?

58
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,391
A miscreant.

59
00:05:53,558 --> 00:05:54,934
A convict.

60
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:56,936
(LAUGHING)

61
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,689
Listen to this nigga!
I'm a miscreant!

62
00:06:00,731 --> 00:06:02,775
Well, you know what?
I like that shit!

63
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:05,235
'Cause that makes me sound
like a con with class.

64
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:08,029
Hey, Ralph Waldo
"Petey" Greene,

65
00:06:08,113 --> 00:06:09,739
miscreant mack
at your service.

66
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:12,242
You forgot "felon."

67
00:06:12,534 --> 00:06:13,785
"Lowlife."

68
00:06:14,786 --> 00:06:17,371
So do that mean
I got a job or what?

69
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:19,832
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

70
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:22,960
I need you to do me a favor,
sugar. Okay?

71
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:25,921
I need you to go home
and take this

72
00:06:25,962 --> 00:06:28,715
right on down to Nighthawk
for me, okay?

73
00:06:29,549 --> 00:06:30,675
Here.

74
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:32,594
Here!

75
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:34,387
Come on, take it!

76
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:36,013
Here!

77
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:38,599
Ain't no padding in there,
sweetie.

78
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:40,809
You tell him
it's all me, okay?

79
00:06:40,893 --> 00:06:42,186
PETEY: Vernell.

80
00:06:42,895 --> 00:06:45,105
What?
You don't get your ass in that room...

81
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:46,440
Oh, shut up.
It's just a bra.

82
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:48,275
Hey, radio man!

83
00:06:48,316 --> 00:06:49,359
You better come on!

84
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,152
I'm gonna look you up
when I get out of here, man.

85
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:52,904
Yeah?
How many years you pulling?

86
00:06:52,987 --> 00:06:54,030
Five to ten.

87
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,699
Nickel to a dime.
It ain't shit, baby.

88
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:57,950
You do that.

89
00:06:57,992 --> 00:07:01,287
I'm the best there is, baby.
I'm the greatest!

90
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:03,914
I'm the greatest
of all time, baby!

91
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,418
NIGHTHAWK: This is
The Nighthawk Show,

92
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:12,922
doing it for all those fine young
things down at Howard University.

93
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:16,509
The Love Hawk
with you all night,

94
00:07:16,592 --> 00:07:19,470
rocking your radio
in the nation's capital.

95
00:07:20,095 --> 00:07:24,891
It's 5:10 on the
Sounds of Soul, the big O-L.

96
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:27,477
We keep losing ground to WOOK.

97
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:31,564
We can make up the lost ground on OK, sir.
I mean, we have a very exciting slate.

98
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:33,858
Great music, talk... Sounds good,
but it's not working.

99
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:35,443
What's the problem?

100
00:07:35,526 --> 00:07:37,570
The problem is we've lost
touch with the real DC

101
00:07:37,653 --> 00:07:40,239
in our attempts
to win over the Beltway.

102
00:07:40,322 --> 00:07:42,408
This has always been
a station of the people

103
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:44,868
and in case you forgot,
most of the people don't live in Georgetown.

104
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,536
Yeah, but the people who live
in Georgetown

105
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,122
do shop at Giant Foods
and Woody's.

106
00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:50,582
Sponsors that pay your salary.

107
00:07:50,665 --> 00:07:54,043
No. I pay his salary,
and yours.

108
00:07:55,503 --> 00:07:58,547
Maybe I should start paying
your salary to him.

109
00:07:59,715 --> 00:08:01,925
Sir, I think...
I'm serious.

110
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:04,219
What do you say, Dewey?

111
00:08:04,636 --> 00:08:07,222
You think
you can turn us around?

112
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:09,516
Yes sir, I do.
Good.

113
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,101
Let's give it a try.

114
00:08:14,854 --> 00:08:16,230
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

115
00:08:16,314 --> 00:08:19,400
MAN: Sir, I just need
a minute of your time, please.

116
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:23,695
PETEY: Hey, y'all, guess what?
I found out today I ain't a con, y'all.

117
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:25,072
For real.

118
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:30,076
I am not a con,
or a felon, or a thug.

119
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,413
No. I am a miscreant.

120
00:08:33,454 --> 00:08:34,747
(LAUGHS)

121
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,415
Now, y'all know what that is?
Good morning.

122
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:40,127
That's a con, brother.
A felon, a thug.

123
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:42,796
We ain't in prison.

124
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,757
No, this
a correctional facility.

125
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,511
See, when you broke into
that car, or shot that nigga,

126
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:52,305
it wasn't 'cause you a wrong-doing motherfucker, no.

127
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,016
No, see,
you troubled, brother.

128
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:57,018
You disenfranchised.

00:08:57,435 --> 00:09:01,605
ANNOUNCER: The Tonight Show
Starring Johnny Carson. And now...

130
00:09:01,647 --> 00:09:05,442
PETEY: All this wordplay so that
we don't have to face the truth.

131
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:10,280
'Cause the truth is,
no matter how many ways you try to slice it,

132
00:09:11,156 --> 00:09:12,490
I'm a con.

Yeah! Come on, Warden!
What you got?

137
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:31,007
You got that little dick?

Who the hell is that man
on my tower?

00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:42,476
Hey, Warden! You got a little, itty-bitty dick!
That's right! That's you, Warden!

142
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,228
Shoot him.
Sir?

143
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:46,104
Right between the eyes.

144
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:48,732
I don't know
if we can do that, legally.

145
00:09:48,815 --> 00:09:51,651
Technically,
he's not trying to escape.

146
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:53,861
Well, where in hell can I shoot him, then?
Listen here!

147
00:09:53,945 --> 00:09:57,490
I want Petey Greene!

148
00:09:57,573 --> 00:09:59,492
You hear me, Warden?

149
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:03,078
I want you to get Petey Greene
out here, right now.

150
00:10:04,413 --> 00:10:07,040
Petey! Petey! Petey!
Petey! Petey! Petey!

151
00:10:07,082 --> 00:10:08,875
POOCHIE: What's he gonna do?

152
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:10,877
Where Petey at?

153
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:13,087
Oh, yo, Petey!

154
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:15,214
(WHOOPING)

155
00:10:15,506 --> 00:10:18,259
Yeah. Look,
you got a little dick!

156
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:21,887
Warden! Your dick, Warden!

157
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:25,891
Look like you got
quite a situation here, sir.

158
00:10:25,932 --> 00:10:27,851
Yes, Mr. Greene, I do.

159
00:10:29,102 --> 00:10:31,771
(SINGING) Warden's got
a little dick!

160
00:10:31,855 --> 00:10:33,606
Can you do anything?

161
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:36,943
I don't know, sir.

162
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:40,279
I mean, what you got
in your boxers is God's doing.

163
00:10:42,322 --> 00:10:45,659
Sorry, Warden, you kind of
walked right into that one.

164
00:10:45,742 --> 00:10:48,912
Poochie! Nigga, what the hell
are you doing up there, man?

165
00:10:50,372 --> 00:10:52,790
Yeah! Warden's got
a little dick!

166
00:10:52,874 --> 00:10:54,959
Now look here, Warden.
Poochie crazy.

167
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:57,461
He's a good kid,
but he got all fucked up on that narcotic.

168
00:10:57,503 --> 00:10:59,922
Come on, Warden, what you got?
I can get him down.

169
00:10:59,964 --> 00:11:01,674
Got that little dick!
I can even shut him up.

170
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:03,467
Come on, what you gonna do?

171
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:06,678
What you gonna do, Warden?

00:29:27,771 --> 00:29:31,483
Oh, man, it's what I do, man.
It's my thing, you know?

512
00:29:31,566 --> 00:29:34,986
I started off making them daily
announcements back at Lorton

513
00:29:35,069 --> 00:29:38,948
as part of the work program,
you know? A reward for good behavior.

514
00:29:39,532 --> 00:29:41,950
Couple years later,
I convinced them to let me play this record

515
00:29:41,992 --> 00:29:45,412
that my Aunt Pig had sent me,
a Sam Cooke record, man, A Change Is Gonna Come.

516
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:47,330
That's an incredible song.

517
00:29:47,414 --> 00:29:51,376
She sent me that record, you know,
to try and give me a little hope,

518
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:53,294
and I wanted to play it
for the men in them cells,

519
00:29:53,336 --> 00:29:55,129
you know, give them some hope.

520
00:29:55,213 --> 00:29:57,256
And I'm telling you, man,

521
00:29:57,465 --> 00:30:02,177
it's the only thing that kept me from going
stone-crazy behind them walls, man.

522
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:04,930
And now that I'm out,
I still need that.

523
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,807
Why should I put my ass on the
line to give you a shot, Petey?

524
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:11,019
Nigga... 'Cause Petey Greene is the real deal, Jack!

525
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:16,190
Shit! I swear to God, I mean,
he is the sho'nuff, I mean, pimp...

526
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,652
Sorry.
It's okay.

527
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,821
See, what this pretty lady
is trying to tell you is that,

528
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:25,198
man, being a DJ, that's
the only thing I'm good at

529
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:27,826
that don't involve me
breaking no law.

530
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,996
And shit, since you here
sharing a drink,

531
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,917
I'm gonna assume that you need
a man of my particular talents.

532
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,837
Three rules.

533
00:30:40,921 --> 00:30:42,131
One,

534
00:30:42,714 --> 00:30:45,092
always know
more than your audience.

535
00:30:45,175 --> 00:30:47,844
Two, you talk shit,
you back it up.

536
00:30:47,886 --> 00:30:49,888
And three, don't you ever,

537
00:30:51,055 --> 00:30:52,181
never, ever,

538
00:30:52,265 --> 00:30:54,183
underestimate me again.

539
00:30:54,725 --> 00:30:56,352
What are you talking about,
man?

540
00:30:56,435 --> 00:31:00,231
I'm gonna give you one more
chance to knock in that nine ball.

541
00:31:00,314 --> 00:31:04,985
Tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.,
WOL, Studio One. Be on time.

542
00:31:06,653 --> 00:31:07,988
Be sober.

543
00:31:08,738 --> 00:31:09,948
And definitely

544
00:31:11,407 --> 00:31:12,992
be by yourself.

545
00:31:13,076 --> 00:31:14,160
(STAMMERING)

546
00:31:14,243 --> 00:31:16,579
You my kind of nigga, Hughes!

547
00:31:16,662 --> 00:31:18,372
You my kind of motherfucker,
Hughes!

548
00:31:18,414 --> 00:31:21,000
We love you!
We love you!

549
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:22,418
Oh my God!

550

(EXCLAIMING)

551
00:31:25,253 --> 00:31:27,380
We need to make
a personnel change.

552
00:31:27,464 --> 00:31:29,215
Really? Who?

553
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:30,633
Sunny Jim.

554
00:31:31,426 --> 00:31:32,719
You're not serious.

555
00:31:32,802 --> 00:31:36,013
Sir, morning shows are becoming
more than just a leisurely stroll.

556
00:31:36,097 --> 00:31:37,348
We have to compete here.

557
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:39,266
WOOK is killing us
in the morning.

558
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:42,102
But Sunny Jim is a DC icon!

559
00:31:42,186 --> 00:31:45,439
Everyone loves Sunny Jim.
He's so sunny.

560
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,857
No sir, you love Sunny Jim.

561
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,734
Sunny Jim is a relic
of a bygone radio age.

562
00:31:49,818 --> 00:31:51,778
We don't play Nat "King" Cole
or The Drifters anymore.

563
00:31:51,861 --> 00:31:53,404
And our DJ's have
to reflect that.

564
00:31:53,488 --> 00:31:56,073
That's why we have Nighthawk
and Soul Papa.

565
00:31:56,157 --> 00:31:59,451
I'm not turning this into some kind of
teenybopper American Bandstand.

566
00:31:59,493 --> 00:32:01,286
We're a respectable
R&B station.

567
00:32:01,328 --> 00:32:04,790
With all due respect, sir,
this is not a respectable town.

568
00:32:04,831 --> 00:32:06,291
This is DC.

569
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:07,709
You see them out
on the mall every day,

570
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:10,253
protesting the so-called
respectable establishment.

571
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:13,923
We can't become the establishment,
or they'll turn on us.

572
00:32:20,971 --> 00:32:22,139
Who do you have in mind?

573
00:32:22,181 --> 00:32:24,766
Well, sir, I found a DJ
from an out-of-town station.

574
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,144
He has a major following,

575
00:32:27,185 --> 00:32:30,772
and he's recently
been released

576
00:32:30,855 --> 00:32:32,523
from his contract.

577
00:32:37,695 --> 00:32:40,948
Jim, come back here, please.
It's nothing personal.

578
00:32:42,157 --> 00:32:44,326
Oh, shit! I'm sorry...

579
00:32:44,368 --> 00:32:45,994
Watch where the hell
you're going!

580
00:32:46,078 --> 00:32:47,537
All right, man.

581
00:32:48,538 --> 00:32:50,665
Oh, no.
PETEY: Hey, sugar!

582
00:32:50,748 --> 00:32:52,834
You know the drill.
Call your man.

583
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:54,293
I don't think so.

584
00:32:54,377 --> 00:32:55,795
Let me ask you something.

585
00:32:55,878 --> 00:32:57,546
You ever had anybody
eat your pussy?

586
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,881
Mr. Sonderling!

587
00:33:01,216 --> 00:33:03,051
What's wrong, Freda?

588
00:33:03,552 --> 00:33:06,096
Oh, God. Blue Blazes.
How the radio business?

589
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:07,973
I put up with your
shenanigans out front

590
00:33:08,056 --> 00:33:09,724
for a week, Mr. Brown.
Greene.

591
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:11,768
All right, Mr. Green,
what do you want now?

592
00:33:11,851 --> 00:33:13,394
I'm your DJ, man!

593
00:33:13,478 --> 00:33:14,896
Freda, call the police.

594
00:33:14,937 --> 00:33:18,774
God damn! Y'all got some hospitality
issues around this motherfucker!

595
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:20,734
You're cutting it close.

596
00:33:20,776 --> 00:33:23,654
What can I say, man?
Had to get my vine together.

597
00:33:23,737 --> 00:33:25,072
Your vine?
Yeah.

598
00:33:25,155 --> 00:33:26,490
You're going on the...

599
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:27,532
Fuck.

600
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:29,576
Mr. Sonderling,

601
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:33,329
this is our new morning DJ.

602
00:33:39,376 --> 00:33:40,586
I've been hoodwinked!

603
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:42,754
Come on.

604
00:33:42,838 --> 00:33:47,259
You are out of your mind if you think
I'm gonna put this person on the air.

605
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,551
Sir, I know
this is unorthodox...

606
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:50,136
Unorthodox? It's insane!

607
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,096
Sir, hear me out.
This man has a unique voice.

608
00:33:52,138 --> 00:33:54,390
I just have a feeling...
I have much more than just a feeling.

609
00:33:54,474 --> 00:33:57,268
Sir, we need to put somebody on the air
in the next two minutes or we go black.

610
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,436
Black, black, black.

611
00:34:02,815 --> 00:34:05,108
Freda, run after Jim, he might
still be in the building!

612
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,526
Sir, we don't have time.

613
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:09,404
You're just gonna have
to trust me. One show.

614
00:34:10,321 --> 00:34:11,656
One shot.

615
00:34:14,158 --> 00:34:16,410
Our morning show's already
in the toilet.

616
00:34:16,494 --> 00:34:18,954
We don't have a thing to lose.
You don't have a thing to lose!

617
00:34:19,038 --> 00:34:21,957
FREDA ON INTERCOM: Sir,
it's one minute to air, and Jim's gone.

618
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:24,001
Oh, for crying out loud.

619
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:27,337
It's my own fault
for listening to you.

620
00:34:30,173 --> 00:34:32,634
All right, one show, one shot.

621
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:35,011
I want you on air with him.
You can introduce him.

622
00:34:35,052 --> 00:34:37,221
I'll be watching and listening
to every word, young man.

623
00:34:37,304 --> 00:34:39,473
You watch your language on the air.
Scout's honor.

624
00:34:39,515 --> 00:34:40,683
Okay.

625
00:34:41,266 --> 00:34:42,559
Let's go.

626
00:34:46,855 --> 00:34:48,148
You ready?
Yeah.

627
00:34:48,189 --> 00:34:53,611
Okay, remember, always talk,
no dead air. Talk about your cat, your car,

628
00:34:53,695 --> 00:34:55,696
anything, but no dead space.

629
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,822
And watch your language.

630
00:34:56,906 --> 00:35:01,201
Okay. Now, you're a man of Washington,
so speak to Washington, okay?

631
00:35:01,285 --> 00:35:03,287
Connect to Washington. Okay?

632
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,454
Yeah.

here to spin the tunes that will blow your mind,

already, maybe riding a bike.

656
00:36:30,033 --> 00:36:32,660
I'm gonna play the music

657
00:36:33,453 --> 00:36:36,080

No, man.

I ain't drunk.
It's nerves, man. I'm nervous.

get your ass back in there.

hands on me, man!

back in there before the song ends!

00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,803
Well, over the break,
I was asked to be myself.

682
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:25,097
So, who is Petey Greene?

683
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:29,976
Well, I got an eighth-grade education
with a Ph.D. From the streets.

684
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:34,230
I'm a recovering alcoholic,
been sober five hours.

685
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:37,608
But I ain't touched a needle
in over eight years, y'all.

686
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:40,653
That's right.
Kicked heroin dead in its ass.

687
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,572
I been incarcerated
over half my life,

688
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,907
most recently down at Lorton.

689
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:49,160
My mama been in jail
for 30 years,

690
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:52,497
and as we speak my daddy's
pulling 21 in Alcatraz.

691
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,458
I am an all-around hustler,

692
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:59,170
and some of my best friends
is pimps, whores and gamblers.

693
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:03,549
But I guess that don't make me
no different than Berry Gordy.

694
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,634
And hell,
that brother own a label!

I'm in pretty good company.

697
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:12,682
Maybe I'll own a label
one day, y'all. "P-Town."

698

giving you nothing but the sho'nuff,

enjoying it, too.

But in all seriousness, folks,

720
00:40:14,155 --> 00:40:19,201
I gotta apologize about something that I
said a little earlier that upset some folks.

721
00:40:19,994 --> 00:40:21,995
I gotta apologize
to Mr. Berry Gordy

722
00:40:22,037 --> 00:40:25,082
for making him out
to be a hustler and a pimp.

723
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:30,795
Mr. Gordy's a very important man,
and he's done a great deal.

724
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:37,093
And I love the way he takes
the little brothers and sisters,

725
00:40:37,843 --> 00:40:41,680
broke-down runaways,
the downtrodden from the projects,

726
00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:44,182
and he gets them
off the streets.

727
00:40:44,516 --> 00:40:48,728
Then he puts a few dollars in their pockets,
teaches them how to talk and how to walk,

728
00:40:48,812 --> 00:40:52,315
then sends them right back out there
to bring him a whole lot of money.

729
00:40:52,398 --> 00:40:56,652
So I'm sorry if in any way
I made him out to be a pimp.

730

apologize, Mr. Berry Gordy,

If you disagree,
tell me like a man.

847
00:47:35,226 --> 00:47:36,394
Dewey, have you
lost your mind?

848
00:47:36,477 --> 00:47:38,395
Open this door right now!
Even if you're a woman.

849
00:47:38,479 --> 00:47:40,522
Mr. Greene, sir,
you are trespassing!

850
00:47:40,606 --> 00:47:44,359
I'm tired of hearing fools complaining
in barber chairs and beauty shops.

851
00:47:44,401 --> 00:47:46,027
Let your opinion out.

852
00:47:46,111 --> 00:47:52,200
Come on and give me a call at this station.
The number is 215-JK5-0199.

853
00:47:52,533 --> 00:47:54,243
Somebody tell Freda to call the cops.
That number again,

854
00:47:54,327 --> 00:47:57,747
215-JK5-0199. Dewey, this is outrageous.
Open the door!

855
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:01,166
And now, old Petey gonna play
a little non-Motown for you.

856
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:05,545
Dewey, open this door.
You're both in trouble. Do you hear me?

857
00:48:05,587 --> 00:48:06,963
You are in real trouble,
mister!

858
00:48:07,047 --> 00:48:08,131
Come on.

859
00:48:08,214 --> 00:48:10,425
Come out of there
right now.

860

Yeah. Yeah.

Sure is.

868
00:48:25,814 --> 00:48:28,900
Petey, didn't I see you last week
down at the strip club on 14th Street?

869
00:48:28,984 --> 00:48:31,903
Oh, yeah, I was down there.
Wasn't to see no show.

870
00:48:31,986 --> 00:48:34,614
But that don't mean I mind the
company of shake-dancers. No.

871
00:48:34,655 --> 00:48:36,490
My girl, Vernell,
she used to be shake-dancer.

872
00:48:36,574 --> 00:48:37,658
She has a bar down there now.

you're trying to prove?

Come on. Dewey!

00:49:00,012 --> 00:49:02,806
No, no, no, no. Put it
straight through on the board.

Do you realize what you've done?
Are you trying to ruin me?

I'm sorry, sir,
it was the only way.

893
00:49:27,787 --> 00:49:30,123
You just let this fellow ruin your career.
You're finished, Dewey.

894
00:49:30,206 --> 00:49:32,458
You're making a mistake, sir.
You can't see it, but I can.

895
00:49:32,542 --> 00:49:35,336
If you throw us out,
we're gonna walk straight over to WOOK.

these men out of the building?

have been flooded.

Wait a minute.

905
00:50:03,654 --> 00:50:05,405
Good morning, WOL.

906
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,408
Yes, ma'am, he is,

907
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:13,413
but I'm afraid he's real busy right now.
You know, we're getting a lot of calls.

908

Yes ma'am, I will,
and thank you.

Keep listening.

DEWEY: Morning music and a talk show,
with a man of the people.

I promise you that.

All right, thank you all.
Everything's fine here.

Let's all get back to work.
Thank you again.

00:50:45,484 --> 00:50:47,736
The next time you decide
to make a personnel change,

919
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:49,154
at least put it in a memo.

920
00:50:49,237 --> 00:50:52,323
Hold it. You can't give
this thug a job.

921

Man, I got your thug
right here. Ten inches.

Be cool, Jim.

What?
We'll talk. We'll talk, okay?

I want him on a short leash.
A very short leash.

925
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,500
And I want a morals clause
in your contract.

926
00:51:03,584 --> 00:51:05,085
Fine, man, whatever.
I'll sign it.

927
00:51:05,168 --> 00:51:07,170
Just let me get back to work, okay?
Jim, wait up.

928
00:51:07,254 --> 00:51:09,047
Can I get back to work?

929
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,174
All right. But you watch your language.
All right!

930
00:51:11,257 --> 00:51:14,218
And you keep an eye on him.
Thank you, sir.

"I don't know, Aunt Pig."

I read my indictment papers,

Good evening, Washington,
and welcome to P-Town!

1177
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,627
I'm happy you could make it.

1178
01:12:02,003 --> 01:12:03,921
I'm glad you could show.

1179
01:12:05,256 --> 01:12:09,677
But the government's the most happy,
'cause y'all ain't burning down shit no more.

1180
01:12:13,347 --> 01:12:16,516
On my way over here,
this white man say,

1181
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,727
"Mr. Greene, why them niggers
lose their mind

1182
01:12:19,811 --> 01:12:22,230
"and burn their shit down
that way?"

1183
01:12:23,856 --> 01:12:27,735
He called me "mister,"
but called us "niggers."

1184
01:12:28,652 --> 01:12:32,155
I say, "Hey, we ain't the ones
that pulled that trigger!

1185
01:12:33,365 --> 01:12:36,201
"And if you keep
calling us niggers,

1186
01:12:36,284 --> 01:12:38,203
"your mothers, fathers,
sisters and brothers

"gonna have to call
the grave digger."

1188
01:12:44,584 --> 01:12:47,795
I say, "Mr. Charlie,

1189
01:12:47,878 --> 01:12:50,381
"I ain't seen
no niggers last night.

angry black folk, down for the fight."

1191
01:13:02,892 --> 01:13:05,728
But I'm here to tell y'all,
we ain't filled with hate.

a big old P-Town welcome

disgruntled citizens of the United States,

1228
01:15:09,758 --> 01:15:12,553
while the flag flew at half-mast for Martin Luther King.

1229
01:15:12,594 --> 01:15:15,013
Amid the chaos today,
two local radio broadcasters,

1230
01:15:15,097 --> 01:15:19,225
Dewey Hughes and Petey Greene are
being credited with restoring calm

1231
01:15:19,309 --> 01:15:21,561
to the nation's capital.

1232

PETEY ON LOUDSPEAKER: Now,
DC is Chocolate City, y'all know that's right.

1233
01:15:26,107 --> 01:15:29,568
Now they wanna keep us down,
'cause they afraid of what's gonna happen

1234
01:15:29,652 --> 01:15:31,695
if we stand up.

1235
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:34,573
Why do you think
they send our boys off to war

1236
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:38,118
instead of keeping them in school,
where they can learn to score?

1237
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:39,327
Yeah!
Yeah!

1238
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:42,288
Because the white folk know
that if we stand tall,

1239
01:15:42,372 --> 01:15:46,167
oh, buddy,
we gonna have something called Black Power, y'all!

Right? All of y'all
look beautiful today.

1241
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:55,342
Psychologist asked me what I thought
about the word "nigger." I said...

1242
01:15:55,425 --> 01:16:00,179
Lady, "nigger" is the greatest
stress reliever ever invented.

1243
01:16:00,263 --> 01:16:04,183
See, white man say "nigger,"
he ready for a six-month hibernation, am I right?

1244
01:16:04,267 --> 01:16:05,434
But, see, a black man,

1245
01:16:05,518 --> 01:16:09,980
he could say "honkey," "ofay,"
"cracker," "peckerwood"

1246
01:16:10,064 --> 01:16:11,190
a million times,

1247
01:16:11,273 --> 01:16:13,275
still wanna go out there
and kill somebody.

1248
01:16:13,817 --> 01:16:17,862
You're gonna to have to tone it down, Petey.
I've got the FCC all over my rear.

1249
01:16:17,946 --> 01:16:21,658
Well, with all due respect,
sir, the FCC can kiss my ass.

but the truth.

As long as the people
wanna hear it,

1252
01:16:24,994 --> 01:16:26,162
I'm gonna keep telling it.

1253
01:16:26,203 --> 01:16:27,913
I'm gonna talk it
on the radio,

1254
01:16:27,997 --> 01:16:29,581
and I'm gonna talk it
on the streets.

1255
01:16:29,665 --> 01:16:31,250
I'm gonna talk it
to the police,

1256

Tricky Dick!

They're still calling.

Oh man, what a day.
That was a hell of a day.

1263

Thank you, man.

01:21:41,117 --> 01:21:42,076
Speaking of which...

1339
01:21:42,493 --> 01:21:44,787
I gotta apologize again.

1340
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:48,582
Now, I know some of y'all heard
that I lost my mind last night.

1341
01:21:48,666 --> 01:21:51,960
Or as my Aunt Pig would say,
"Boy, you're crazy!"

1342
01:21:52,002 --> 01:21:54,755
And I was, too.
I was, I ain't lying.

1343
01:21:54,796 --> 01:21:58,174
See, I drank about
four gallons of Cold Duck,

1344
01:21:58,258 --> 01:22:00,927
and then I just walked right up on
stage and started pissing, just...

1345
01:22:00,969 --> 01:22:02,428
(GRUNTING)

1346
01:22:03,095 --> 01:22:05,097
Didn't even bother grabbing
it, just walked and...

1347
01:22:05,181 --> 01:22:06,640
(GRUNTING)

1348
01:22:06,766 --> 01:22:08,851
Started skipping with it.
I said...

(IMITATING LAUGHING)

1350
01:22:10,561 --> 01:22:13,772
By the time I was through,
the stagehand was drunk.

1351
01:22:13,814 --> 01:22:15,440
(ALL LAUGHING)

1352
01:22:16,316 --> 01:22:19,235
And we had a whole row of white folk too,
all the way across.

1353
01:22:19,319 --> 01:22:20,778
Real important people, now.

1354
01:22:20,862 --> 01:22:22,738
We talking about the big shots,
you know, the muckety-mucks.

1355
01:22:22,822 --> 01:22:25,700
Not like you, sir, but...

1356
01:22:26,992 --> 01:22:30,621
I'm telling you,
them crackers dropped dead right on the spot.

1357
01:22:30,704 --> 01:22:34,166
All of them. Looked like a row
of albino dominoes, just...

1358
01:22:36,459 --> 01:22:41,839
Judge say, "Mr. Petey Greene,
we charging you with using your dick

1359
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:45,426
"as a lethal weapon.
Now how do you plead?"

1360
01:22:45,509 --> 01:22:48,178
I said, "Your Honor! Not guilty,
Your Honor, not guilty!

1361
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:53,183
"Come on now, I don't want no parts of this.
I use my dick to make love, not war!

1362
01:22:55,477 --> 01:22:58,021
"Shit only look lethal
to white folk."

1363
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:06,779
Good evening, Petey.
This is Petey Greene's Washington.

1364
01:23:06,862 --> 01:23:09,114
DEWEY: Okay,
let's try that again.

1365
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:10,365
For what?

1366
01:23:10,407 --> 01:23:13,827
You said, "Good evening, Petey Greene.
This is Petey Greene's Washington."

1367
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:16,079
No, I didn't.
Yeah, you did.

1368
01:23:16,162 --> 01:23:17,872
Dewey, I didn't say...
That's some stupid shit.

1369
01:23:17,914 --> 01:23:19,499
How many times
have we been doing this show?

1370
01:23:19,582 --> 01:23:21,584
I'm gonna say some stupid
shit like that? Come on, man.

1371
01:23:21,668 --> 01:23:23,628
Okay, my mistake. I didn't say,
"Good evening, Petey."

1372
01:23:23,711 --> 01:23:26,881
That's stupid.
Okay, let's try it again. Please.

1373
01:23:27,798 --> 01:23:29,800
Are you ready?
Born so.

1374
01:23:29,883 --> 01:23:31,343
Good evening...

1375
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:34,888
Okay, let's try it again.

1376
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:36,765
Let's try it again.
See what you did?

1377
01:23:36,806 --> 01:23:39,350
I fucked up, is what I did!
Yep.

1378
01:23:39,434 --> 01:23:41,561
I gotta stop drinking.
God damn! Maybe.

1379
01:23:41,936 --> 01:23:43,521
Good evening, Washington.

1380
01:23:43,604 --> 01:23:46,732
My guest tonight is a pimp that
I wouldn't trust to wash my car,

1381
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,275
but y'all done
elected him city official...

1382
01:23:48,317 --> 01:23:49,902

Where's Petey, huh?
Lay it on me, now! Lay it on me!

You're not gonna
believe what's happening.

1390

You're not gonna
believe it, man.

1391

Was it Free Pussy Day
or something?

1392
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:19,095
You are looking at the baddest
manager on the planet.

1393
01:24:19,179 --> 01:24:21,472
You, my man,
are doing The Tonight Show.

on The Tonight Show, baby!

1396

You, me, Carson.

1397
01:24:34,359 --> 01:24:36,361
This is it, my man.
Yeah.

1398
01:24:36,444 --> 01:24:39,697
This is that moment that
I've been telling you about.

1399
01:24:39,781 --> 01:24:41,699
Yeah. Yeah!

1400
01:24:42,784 --> 01:24:45,244

Yeah.
Yeah. Okay.

1403

Yeah.
Okay.

1404
01:25:25,698 --> 01:25:28,576
New York, New York, y'all.
Like they say.

1405
01:25:28,617 --> 01:25:31,328
If you make it here...
I'll be a bitch-ass nigga.

I know.

1410
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:53,640
Glad you could make it
on such short notice.

1411
01:25:53,724 --> 01:25:56,726
If you called us twenty seconds ago, sir,
we would have been here.

1412
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:58,728
And you must be Petey.
Hey.

1413
01:25:58,812 --> 01:25:59,896
Heard a lot about you.

1414

to hearing your routine.

1415
01:26:01,981 --> 01:26:03,941
Well, I just hope
I don't disappoint him.

1416

the baddest comic in America.

like you do,

Yeah?

You have to get him
out of this, man.

1451
01:28:58,810 --> 01:29:01,646
What? Are you nuts?
Listen to me, Dewey.

1452
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:06,317
I know that man. Hell, you know that man.
And I know you saw that look.

1453
01:29:06,358 --> 01:29:09,028
I didn't see shit.
I saw nerves.

1454

how important this is to you.

1455

He does, too! That's the
only reason why he's here!

1456
01:29:13,907 --> 01:29:17,369
To me? It has nothing to do
with me. Bullshit, Vernell.

1457
01:29:17,452 --> 01:29:23,207
Bullshit! I mean, Cosby, Gregory, Pryor,
they've all been on that stage.

1458
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:26,627
What comic in the world doesn't
want to be on The Tonight Show?

1459
01:29:26,710 --> 01:29:28,003
You see, he ain't a comic.

1460
01:29:28,087 --> 01:29:30,589
He ain't a comic, he ain't
a television personality,

1461
01:29:30,672 --> 01:29:32,216
he ain't a civic leader!

1462
01:29:32,299 --> 01:29:34,551
He's just a regular-ass
nigga from DC who...

1463
01:29:39,389 --> 01:29:42,308
He's just a regular-ass nigga from
DC who likes to run his mouth.

1464
01:29:42,391 --> 01:29:45,061
And for some reason,
people respond! Vernell?

1465
01:29:45,102 --> 01:29:48,188
Vernell, you're wrong, okay?

1466
01:29:49,857 --> 01:29:51,775
Look where we are.

1467
01:29:52,150 --> 01:29:53,402
Look where we are.

1468
01:29:53,485 --> 01:29:57,864
He doesn't want to be here, Dewey.
I can see it in his eyes.

1469
01:29:58,656 --> 01:30:02,035
Just keep an eye on him.

1470
01:30:02,118 --> 01:30:04,954
Make sure he doesn't leave
that room. Okay?

So I'm gonna give you
one last shot.

1671
01:49:08,961 --> 01:49:10,379
That's deep.

1672
01:49:10,462 --> 01:49:11,797
(CHUCKLES)

1673
01:49:12,839 --> 01:49:14,800
Yeah it was, wasn't it?

1674
01:49:17,093 --> 01:49:18,887
I might put that
in a card someday.

1675
01:49:18,970 --> 01:49:20,596
(PETEY CHUCKLES)

1676
01:49:23,975 --> 01:49:25,893
(POOL BALLS STRIKING)

1677
01:49:27,061 --> 01:49:28,729
Good shot, Petey.

1678
01:49:41,032 --> 01:49:41,908
(CHATTERING)

1679
01:49:46,996 --> 01:49:50,207
Everybody come back to the
shop with their eyes fucked up...

1680
01:49:51,708 --> 01:49:53,001
Stop it!

1681
01:49:55,003 --> 01:49:56,379
(INAUDIBLE)

1682
01:50:03,344 --> 01:50:08,641
PETEY: I ain't nothing, man,
I ain't nothing but a con and a thief.

1683
01:50:08,724 --> 01:50:11,268
So I ain't up here trying
to be nobody's preacher.

1684
01:50:11,351 --> 01:50:15,522
I'm just trying to tell the truth to y'all,
like I promised I would.

1685
01:50:21,778 --> 01:50:25,865
DEWEY: Petey liked to say
that he was just a con.

1686
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:28,367
Telling it like it is.

1687
01:50:30,077 --> 01:50:32,120
But he was more than that.

1688
01:50:37,417 --> 01:50:40,295
He said the things
that we were afraid to say.

1689
01:50:42,380 --> 01:50:43,881
I'm sorry, man.

1690
01:50:51,597 --> 01:50:54,349
He was the bravest man
that I ever met.

1691
01:50:56,726 --> 01:50:59,437
He was, and still is,
everything I'm not.

1692
01:51:02,815 --> 01:51:04,442
And that's why I love him.

1693
01:51:04,525 --> 01:51:05,985
MAN: Yeah.

1694
01:51:10,114 --> 01:51:12,532
So, in the words
of my best friend,

1695
01:51:15,785 --> 01:51:18,079
"That's all we got.
MAN: Yeah!

1696
01:51:18,163 --> 01:51:19,956
"There ain't no more.
That's right!

1697
01:51:20,039 --> 01:51:21,916
"Time is tight.

1698
01:51:21,999 --> 01:51:24,502
"It's the end of the show.

1699
01:51:24,585 --> 01:51:28,464
"So grab your head
and make a fist."

1700
01:51:29,048 --> 01:51:31,758
"Listen to me
and remember this."

1701
01:51:31,842 --> 01:51:33,135
...and remember this.

1702
01:51:33,218 --> 01:51:36,513
I tell it to the hot,
I tell it to the cold.

1703
01:51:36,596 --> 01:51:40,141
I tell it to the young,
I tell it to the old.

1704
01:51:40,224 --> 01:51:43,019
Don't want no laughing,
don't want no crying.

1705
01:51:43,102 --> 01:51:46,063
And most of all, no signifying.
DEWEY: "...no signifying!"

1706
01:51:46,647 --> 01:51:50,526
This is Petey Greene's Washington,
ladies and gentlemen.

1707
01:51:50,567 --> 01:51:52,110
This is P-Town!

1708
01:51:52,194 --> 01:51:55,572
ALL: Petey! Petey!
Petey! Petey!

1709
01:51:55,655 --> 01:51:59,367
Petey! Petey! Petey! Petey!

1710
01:52:05,539 --> 01:52:06,665
PETEY: Be cool, y'all.

1711
01:52:54,668 --> 01:52:56,503
PETEY: Wake up, God damn it!

1712
01:54:16,534 --> 01:54:18,453
VERNELL: Shirley Chisholm
for President, everybody!

1713
01:54:18,536 --> 01:54:20,997
Vote Shirley Chisholm
for President, 1972!

1714
01:56:14,059 --> 01:56:17,103
PETEY: Why do you think
they send our boys off to war?

1715
01:58:27,348 --> 01:58:30,893
Look here. I ain't never
asked for this shit.
