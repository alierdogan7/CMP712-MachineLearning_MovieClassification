1
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,994
T I M E R E G A I N E D

2
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,438
Then, one day,

3
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,268
everything changes.

4
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,513
Things that had been

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,274
detestabIe

6
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,509
to you,

7
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,635
that had aIways been banned,

8
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,399
are now aIIowed.

9
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,154
For instance:
May I have some champagne?

10
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,599
Why, certainIy,

11
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,037
if it makes you happy.

12
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,991
You can't beIieve your ears.

13
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,350
You send for everything

14
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,109
that had been most forbidden.

15
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,835
That's why there is something...

16
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,397
rather indecent...

17
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,155
about the unbeIievabIe frivoIity

18
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,269
of the dying.

19
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,916
Dictating is too tiring.

20
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,077
I'II try to write.

21
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,199
You may...

22
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,517
You may bring me

23
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,918
a IittIe hot miIk,
but onIy if it makes you happy.

24
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,638
You know, CeIeste,

25
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,433
if I get through the night,

26
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,749
tomorrow

27
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,352
I'II show the doctors

28
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,197
I'm more than a match for them.

29
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,709
Wait.

30
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,430
There, in the desk.

31
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,791
Thank you.
You may go now.

32
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,150
Don't Ieave me aIone too Iong.

33
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,475
Odette.

34
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,355
Grandmother.

35
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,759
The Verdurins.

36
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,275
Mama.

37
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,589
Papa.

38
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,229
Cottard.

39
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,111
Robert...
Robert de Saint-Loup.

40
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,717
What's he doing here?

41
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,915
Papa again.

42
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,754
RacheI.

43
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,669
GiIberte.

44
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,636
Me.

45
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,030
- DisgracefuI!
- But pretty.

46
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,834
I adore Chopin, don't you?

47
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,029
Oh, yes!

48
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,391
What can we do?
Odette is around.

49
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,912
- Isn't this Beethoven?
- I'm afraid so.

50
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,919
The nerve of her,
just turning up!

51
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,436
She's aged.
Or am I dreaming?

52
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,358
You're dreaming.

53
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,832
She's ravishing.

54
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,831
DarIing! LoveIy to see you!

55
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,474
I'd Iost hope.
How is Monsieur?

56
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,035
You know CharIie.
He's hiIarious!

57
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,915
You missed his Iatest jest.
Beethoven's German dances!

58
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,755
Your son-in-Iaw Ioves Beethoven.

59
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,915
Schumann, actuaIIy.

60
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,909
Of course. I had an awfuI night.
A migraine.

61
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,590
I shouIdn't have read the news
before bed!

62
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,598
You heard about that soIdier
on Ieave?

63
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,998
He returned
onIy to find his house bombed,

64
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,034
his chiIdren dead, his wife crippIed.
It's too much!

65
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,468
So unfair.

66
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,638
I'm babbIing! Some refreshment?

67
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,273
MoreI's gone again.

68
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,110
AIways breezing in and out.

69
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,791
Perhaps I chased him away.

70
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,591
Come! Look at this!

71
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,391
Do come! It's much funnier
than any of your stories!

72
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,355
MarceI?

73
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,396
Once upon a time,
a jealous husband

74
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,878
ordered his innocent wife
to be killed.

75
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,071
She was Genevieve de Brabant.

76
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,037
ln the deep, dark forest
his henchmen took pity on her

77
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,557
and spared her life.

78
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,876
AA few years later, Count Siegfried
found her sleeping in a hollow tree.

79
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,951
Am I disturbing you?
ShouId I stop?

80
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,309
Game's over?

81
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,955
FeeIing bored?

82
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,156
I'm afraid you're too sensitive
to Iook at this.

83
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,316
It takes a reaI soIdier

84
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,837
to Iook such butchery in the eye.

85
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,359
See? I was right.

86
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,715
GiIberte?

87
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,391
Why won't you answer me?

88
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,916
I was short of time that day,
you know.

89
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,595
I'd Iike to have rebuffed you.

90
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,153
ReaIIy? Why?

91
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,033
To make you remember me.

92
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,834
I, for one...

93
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,838
often think
about that sign you made.

94
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,871
Some things you don't forget.

95
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,550
I was tweIve.
It was compIeteIy innocent.

96
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,875
Indecent, you mean!

97
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,957
Whatever did you imagine?

98
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,277
I was onIy saying
how pretty you were.

99
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,595
Did I do wrong?

100
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,269
GiIberte!

101
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,079
MarceI! Come here!

102
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,836
CeIeste?

103
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,515
Are you there?

104
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,792
TeII me the truth.
Are there roses in the house?

105
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,116
Roses? No, sir.

106
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,479
Upon my word.

107
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,477
I beIieve you, but...

108
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,310
Just now when...

109
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,114
Mr. de CharIus came by,
I dozed off.

110
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,309
No one came by.

111
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,836
He may have worn a rose
in his buttonhoIe.

112
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,636
Or thrown it away
on the doorstep.

113
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,198
You know
how a few specks of poIIen...

114
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,637
Mr. de CharIus was wearing no rose.

115
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,159
Do me the pIeasure

116
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,955
of caIIing him
to ask if he threw one away.

117
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,829
AAll day long
in this too countrified house,

118
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,874
which seemed more
like a backwood shelter,

119
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,399
its wallpaper awash with apple trees
in the Japanese style

120
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,558
to hallucinate
the hours you spend in bed,

121
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,913
l spent all day in my bedroom

122
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,510
with its view
of sweet greenery and lilac,

123
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,793
the leaves of the tall trees
down by the shimmering water

124
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,911
and Meseglise Forest.

125
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,996
l enjoyed this view
because l thought

126
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,431
it was so nice to have
all this greenery in my window...

127
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,791
Until, in the vista of green,
l recognized,

128
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,834
etched dark blue in the distance,

129
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,600
the belfry of Combray church.

130
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,150
That beIfry seems
so naturaI and distinguished.

131
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,677
Laugh if you Iike.

132
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,192
It's not cIassicaIIy beautifuI
but I Iike its strange oId face.

133
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,359
If it pIayed the piano,
it wouIdn't pIay crispIy.

134
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,717
I'II be back tomorrow evening.

135
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,112
And gone the day after?

136
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,389
I'm sorry, GiIberte.

137
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,272
I forgot I have to meet
a IocaI man

138
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,879
in Paris.

139
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,752
CouIdn't you...

140
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,109
I don't know...
caII him and say...

141
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,753
Sorry, no.

142
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,557
I'm terribIy sorry.

143
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,908
Do you beIieve me?

144
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,950
FeeI how quick my heart beats.

145
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,709
AbnormaIIy quick.
Because of you.

146
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,275
I hate to see you so sad.

147
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,678
I feeI guiIty.
You can't beIieve how guiIty.

148
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,115
You're overdoing it, Robert.
By far.

149
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,075
GiIberte! Won't you kiss me?

150
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,632
What are you reading?
May I see?

151
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,790
The Goncourts' JournaI.

152
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,310
It's fun.
They write about Papa

153
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,636
and peopIe he knew.

154
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,632
- May I borrow it?
- Take it.

155
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,679
Read it on the train.

156
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,998
I'm keeping that one.

157
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,351
The Girl with Eyes of Gold.

158
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,034
It's very improper!

159
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,113
I know it. It's admirabIe.

160
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,879
You think so?

161
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,472
Those women are jeaIous
onIy of women.

162
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,597
For others, man is the enemy,

163
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,159
the one who brings the wrong caress.

164
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,552
I was miserabIe

165
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,110
when my fiancee Ioved another man.

166
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,472
But not haIf as miserabIe
as if she'd Ioved women.

167
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,918
That fiancee...
Did you Iove her as much as me?

168
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,277
Because you cIaim to have Ioved me.

169
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,269
Perhaps not.
She wasn't your equaI.

170
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,312
But stiII,
I reaIIy Ioved her.

171
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,229
Did she Iove women?

172
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,353
I think so.

173
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,119
I'm not sure.

174
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,275
Here.

175
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,471
You shouId remember her.

176
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,236
AIbertine.

177
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,709
You toId me she was disreputabIe.

178
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,148
I said that?

179
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,310
If I did, you misunderstood.

180
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,879
I was taIking
about fIirting with boys.

181
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,559
And at that age,
nothing much happens.

182
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,798
You know what I think?

183
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,679
We're taIking too much.

184
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,473
And forgetting to eat.

185
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,557
I think that
when you stop Ioving a woman

186
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,030
and see her again,
years Iater...

187
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,476
Between you and her,
there's death.

188
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,830
As if she'd passed away

189
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,952
because your Iove is over.

190
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,671
You mean I'm dead?

191
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,910
I'm onIy thinking

192
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,510
about aII those questions
that once tormented me

193
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,634
but are of no interest to me now.

194
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,995
Such as?

195
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,672
The time I saw you on the Champs
EIysees with a young man.

196
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,871
UnIess it was a young woman.

197
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,599
You have no idea
how sad it made me.

198
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,548
I thought: It's over.

199
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,032
I'II never see her again.

200
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,279
I think I remember.

201
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,432
Don't try to.

202
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,232
It's not worth the effort.

203
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,991
That's what's so awfuI.

204
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,278
Heartbreak...

205
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,957
can kiII...

206
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,718
but Ieaves no trace.

207
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,431
ShaII I say who it was?

208
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,829
PIease pick up the pieces
and throw them away.

209
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,030
Wash them, then put them
in my mahogany box.

210
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,793
AIbertine...

211
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,073
Did you see that man?

212
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,600
At this very moment, Robert is doing
important business with him.

213
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,556
They had a meeting in Paris.

214
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,990
- Did he recognize you?
- I don't know.

215
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,791
Robert doesn't even brief
his cohorts any more.

216
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,830
I'm too tired to confound him.

217
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,193
I'm weary.

218
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,311
Weary of aII these Iies.

219
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,718
It may be my fauIt.

220
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,714
Women who waIIow in their woe
dig their own graves.

221
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,071
I'm mishandIing it.

222
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,236
Has he mentioned this RacheI?

223
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,719
Don't answer.

224
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,477
Robert's your friend, too.

225
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,993
That's not GiIberte's signature.

226
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,073
I teII you it is.

227
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,909
Look. That's an A, not a G.

228
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,072
You're teasing me.

229
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,838
I say what I see.

230
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,510
That's an A.
And that's an N.

231
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,596
It's not.

232
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,710
It is.

233
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,113
Libertinage

234
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,875
He sends a bouquet a night.

235
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,039
It's sweet, but after the twentieth,
you start thinking.

236
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,915
They must be hiding something.

237
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,839
Something fishy.

238
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,433
I'm not one for gossip
but friends say

239
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,200
Robert's a Iiar,
to himseIf and everyone.

240
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,594
But he's a bad Iiar
when you catch him with MoreI.

241
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,475
The Iove in his eyes says it aII.

242
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,355
I don't know...
I can't beIieve it.

243
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,197
What do you think?

244
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,512
Am I crazy to Iove him?

245
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,912
Strawberries in ether!

246
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,870
Like kissing snow.

247
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,277
Did you read Le Figaro?

248
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,957
This week brings more proof
that the arts

249
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,470
are society's
true movers and shakers. Good.

250
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,999
The scandaI...

251
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,359
caused by the performance
of Profanation

252
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,473
is another exampIe
of art's impact on its audience.

253
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,715
How amusing!

254
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,069
- Leaving aIready?
- I'm expected.

255
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,912
May I ask by whom?

256
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,993
An aIgebra cIass.
Didn't I teII you?

257
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,154
- And our dinner?
- Another time.

258
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,753
You know what I'm thinking?

259
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,470
If I ever find out you're unfaithfuI
I'II Ieave you at once.

260
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,599
You must aIways be faithfuI to me.

261
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,313
AbsoIuteIy faithfuI.

262
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,194
Starting here,
where everything starts.

263
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,628
TaIking to yourseIf?

264
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,159
No, to you.

265
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,236
To me?

266
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,758
What were you saying?

267
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,078
That's our secret.
Secrets shouIdn't be repeated.

268
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,111
How was your aIgebra cIass?

269
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,440
I'd rather have been here with you.

270
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,750
CharIie?

271
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,832
Who is this woman?

272
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,392
It's a Iong story.

273
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,200
Someone begged me to find her photo.
She's an actress.

274
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,112
An admirer? A future Iover?

275
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,315
It's a boring story.

276
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,116
I'm counting on you, MarceI.

277
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,754
I know GiIberte trusts you.

278
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,515
You'II teII her better than I
that I stiII Iove her.

279
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,431
There's the other woman, too.

280
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,517
Though I Iove her Iess
than GiIberte.

281
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,880
But she gives
such ampIe proof of her affection.

282
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,391
I'm her first Iove!

283
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,796
Here...

284
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,273
Read this Ietter.

285
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,078
She writes that
she'II never be happy without me.

286
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,036
Before me, she had no one.

287
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,472
No one eIse in her Iife.

288
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,835
GiIberte!

289
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,671
What's she up to?

290
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,678
I feeI I'm intruding.

291
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,714
Not at aII.
We were discussing the BaIkan war.

292
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,674
I suggest you continue over dinner.
It's ready.

293
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,632
Pardon me.
I must have caught a chiII.

294
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,116
Why are you staring at me?

295
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,392
Does my headdress astound you?

296
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,635
Do you Iike it?

297
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,598
It's not at aII you.

298
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,999
If I'm too me,
you don't see me.

299
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,308
Cheer up!
I'm in exceIIent spirits.

300
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,669
Make the most of it.

301
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,672
Come, Iet me show you something.

302
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,230
You remember that mishap?

303
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,950
You were angry for ages.

304
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,355
Now I've done as I shouId.

305
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,231
The cup is fixed,
Iike aII the others.

306
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,394
Reading the Goncourts'Journal
made me feel strangely disturbed.

307
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,515
They wrote about a dinner party

308
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,278
at the Verdurins'house.

309
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,358
Doctor Cottard
and his wife were the

310
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,758
the Polish sculptor Virovski,
Swann the collector,

311
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,349
a grand Russian princess.

312
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,030
Swann said she had shot dead
AArchduke Rudolph.

313
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,591
...Yung Cheng pIates

314
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,110
with their nasturtium borders
and bIuish,

315
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,959
swoIIen iris bIooms.

316
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,948
Dresden pIates,
daintier in their craftsmanship,

317
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,879
their anemic roses turning vioIet.

318
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,756
Sevres pIates, meshed
with the guiIIoche of their fIuting.

319
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,394
And, what is perhaps as rare

320
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,559
is the superb quaIity
of the food served on them.

321
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,516
FineIy simmered deIicacies,

322
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,032
the Iikes of which Parisians,
it must be said,

323
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,390
never find at the grandest dinners.

324
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,878
What a pIeasure it must be

325
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,038
to dine off such fine pIates!

326
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,678
You don't know my husband!

327
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,759
He's singIe-minded.
Pretty things don't interest him.

328
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,791
He'd be happier drinking cider
in a cooI Normandy farmhouse!

329
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,154
You know Normandy?

330
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,033
You Westerners cannot understand

331
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,995
how a writer can penetrate
a woman's innermost depths.

332
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,277
You're a writer yourseIf.
A good one.

333
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,637
You have no idea how successfuI
you'd be in my country.

334
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,956
When my brother died,

335
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,153
every woman in Moscow
wore a bIack ribbon

336
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,035
around her thigh!

337
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,391
About Normandy,
I know EIstir's Iandscapes.

338
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,511
Such deIicate pasteIs...

339
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,199
EIstir? I taught him
aII he knows about fIowers!

340
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,437
He couIdn't teII
an aIthea from a hoIIyhock!

341
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,552
And I taught him
to recognize jasmine.

342
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,197
It's true. Without my wife

343
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,915
that fIower painter,
now haiIed as the best,

344
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,429
couIdn't have painted jasmine.

345
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,755
I taught him fIower arranging.
He had no idea!

346
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,395
How often I'd say, No, EIstir.

347
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:33,595
No! That's not worth painting!
Paint this.

348
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,718
UnfortunateIy our advice
couIdn't prevent his viIe marriage!

349
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,152
Have you noticed Mrs. Verdurin's
magnificent pearI neckIace?

350
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,679
AdmirabIe, I agree.

351
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,633
BIack pearIs.
They used to be white.

352
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,875
Is that so?

353
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,274
My story of our hostess's pearIs

354
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,556
Ieaves Mr. Goncourt skepticaI.

355
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,875
He's wrong.

356
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,752
A fire bIackened them.

357
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,477
I kept certain jeweIs
in a bronze box.

358
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,513
After the fire, we found the box.

359
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,753
The pearIs inside... were Iike this.

360
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,757
TaIk about bIack magic!

361
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,035
There's more.

362
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,069
The changes sometimes observed
in IifeIess matter

363
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,714
aIso appear in the human brain.

364
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,990
I speak as a doctor.

365
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,353
I myseIf treated
Mrs. Verdurin's vaIet,

366
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,438
who aImost died of shock
in the fire

367
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,029
WeII, it changed him.

368
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,712
His handwriting changed,
but so did his innermost personaIity

369
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,838
As if the fire awoke
the monster in him.

370
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,759
This sober man became a drunkard.

371
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,391
A drunk and a Iiar!
And before, he was...

372
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,079
An absoIute pearI!

373
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,432
We had to dismiss him.

374
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,871
l felt vaguely disturbed.

375
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,310
AAfter all,

376
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,399
l met these people daily.
l often dined with them.

377
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,431
The Verdurins,
the Duke of Guermantes, the Cottards.

378
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,788
l could list every one
of their countless vulgarities.

379
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,955
Their outward charm escaped me.

380
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,833
l couldn't help seeing through it,

381
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,999
as a surgeon sees the cancer
beneath a woman's smooth skin.

382
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,592
l dined out,
but l couldn't see the guests.

383
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,031
For instead, l was X-raying them.

384
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,391
Poor MarceI is not weII.

385
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,996
StiII, he writes day and night.

386
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,273
How many voIumes? Ten?

387
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,476
Hush! Or you'II tire him.

388
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,434
They say he's near the end.

389
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,792
The end of what? You mean...

390
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,829
No, his book!
It's aImost finished.

391
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,592
What wiII he have
to Iive for?

392
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,390
How upsetting!

393
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,154
I'II ask Bontemps to see to it.

394
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,796
Norpois had his articIe
censored again.

395
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,993
AII because he hinted
that Percin wouId be fired!

396
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,870
l was in love, my Lord!
l was in love!

397
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,832
AAnd craved love in return!

398
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,476
That day, l admit,
l took fright.

399
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,434
l thought you loved me no more.

400
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,672
Now l see my error.
You love me still.

401
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,949
These are Egyptian tunics.

402
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,913
Dark, straight...
Very war.

403
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,237
See this jeweIry?

404
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,152
My Iatest inspiration.

405
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,554
Made from shrapneI.

406
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,399
My designs were aII inspired

407
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,750
by respect for our soIdiers.

408
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,192
What do they dream about
in the trenches?

409
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,278
SureIy, more daintiness.

410
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,951
For their dear wives at home.

411
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,312
But no excess,
no mispIaced Iuxury.

412
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,760
Just pretty trifIes
to brighten up these dismaI days.

413
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,990
A great designer has no other way
to heIp the war effort.

414
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,716
We aII share that duty.

415
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,958
WiII you take some tea?
Biscuits?

416
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,519
We'II have to tighten our beIts.

417
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,678
Food, gas, eIectricity...

418
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,677
The Senate passed the Iaw.

419
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,476
Even aduItery costs more!

420
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,795
AduItery?

421
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,718
We passed that Iaw, too.

422
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,232
AduItery now carries a 100-franc
fine pIus a few days in jaiI.

423
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,671
I can't see anyone here
being IiabIe.

424
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,519
Do you recognize him?

425
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,712
It's on the tip of my tongue.
TeII me.

426
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:20,910
No.

427
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,919
CharIie, pIay us something
suitabIe for twiIight.

428
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,030
Very weII.

429
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,878
StiII no sign of Odette?

430
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,958
No. I don't know why
she's stopped coming.

431
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,594
Maybe she's ruffIed.
I'm not.

432
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,076
How did I upset her?
She met both husbands here.

433
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,638
If she wants to come back,
she's aIways weIcome.

434
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,794
TweIve German Dances for Piano?

435
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,674
Isn't that risky?

436
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,949
A tribute to my friend CharIus.

437
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,277
Why do you hate him so?

438
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,511
Because he's so virtuous.

439
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,149
Bontemps is right.
You're reckIess.

440
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,429
It's true.

441
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,669
That's why I'm enIisting tomorrow.
For the front.

442
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,552
To uphoId my reputation.

443
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,193
Are you joking?

444
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,240
You're more usefuI as a journaIist.

445
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,590
I'm bored.

446
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,350
So what? I'm bored too.

447
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,839
I'd be even more bored
without you.

448
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,150
I'm taking you hostage.

449
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,155
Beethoven!

450
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,791
The nerve of her!
Just turning up!

451
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,270
She's aged.
Or am I dreaming?

452
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,114
You're dreaming.
She's ravishing.

453
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,838
How IoveIy to see you!
I'd Iost hope.

454
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,352
How IoveIy to see you!
I'd Iost hope.

455
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,632
How is Mr. de ForcheviIIe?
BIah, bIah...

456
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,678
I had too much champagne.
It's so good!

457
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,997
I was at TansonviIIe.
This is for you.

458
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,752
She's been through heII.

459
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,956
My GiIberte has gumption!

460
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,349
The Germans don't. They fight weII,
but Iack what I caII gumption.

461
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,950
Any news of Robert?

462
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,435
Her husband, St-Loup?
He speaks Iike a tommy.

463
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,552
He chats with men
from faraway dominions,

464
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,309
fraternizes with officers
and humbIe privates.

465
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:51,150
I have a soft spot for the EngIish.
They're so fair-pIay!

466
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,315
- Can we go in?
- Sorry, sir.

467
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,671
- Fancy crowd!
- It'II be an aII-night party.

468
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,071
Look, there's CharIus.
With someone.

469
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,435
Mrs. de ForcheviIIe,
I'm afraid we have to cIose.

470
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,351
The curfew's started earIy?

471
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,312
No, it's on time.

472
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,679
I see. We're being kicked out.

473
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,318
May I see you home?

474
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,476
I'II Iet you out the back.

475
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,391
I'd rather waIk aIone.
Do you mind?

476
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,068
No, I quite understand.

477
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,710
Did you hear Cottard is sick?

478
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,150
Everyone says he's overworked.

479
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,998
It's worse than that.

480
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,794
Can we come in?

481
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,233
AIone in the dark?
You Iook Iost.

482
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,035
Mr. de Foix, being Iost
is of minor importance.

483
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,476
The probIem is finding oneseIf.

484
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,318
I'm Iooking for CharIus.

485
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,353
He was here,
dining with someone...

486
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,710
You know how he comes and goes.

487
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,955
Like a ghost.

488
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,559
Or a spy.

489
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,915
You're harsh.

490
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:21,557
My father's no better.
He keeps tabs on everyone I see.

491
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,832
Isn't that viIe,
given whom he sees?

492
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,237
He and St-Loup
are tarred with the same brush.

493
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,273
They're oId friends,
so it couId be true.

494
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,753
I wouIdn't mind,
if onIy he'd stop Iecturing me.

495
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,071
It's drafty out here. Come...

496
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,871
Come meet my friends.

497
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,236
UnIess young peopIe bore you.

498
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,754
A drink? Liqueur, champagne?

499
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:02,236
The Grand Duke said,
Everyone must rise for my wife.

500
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,359
The Duchess repIied,

501
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,836
Rise for your wife?

502
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,032
Men used to Iie down
for her grandmother!

503
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:15,360
The Baron was just here. He can't
be far. He ordered an armagnac.

504
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,628
Youth!

505
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,915
They're ceIebrating de Mericourt's
engagement to Miss d'Ambresac.

506
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,793
He hit the jackpot.
Just in time!

507
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,629
These youngsters Iove
to burn money they don't have.

508
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,593
So they go fortune-hunting.
Swap tips.

509
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,588
Try her. She's ugIy,
but what a dowry!

510
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,559
The dreadfuI things I overhear!

511
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,753
They're ruthIess predators...
but entertaining.

512
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,389
Antoine!
We're dying of thirst!

513
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,079
Coming, Your Grace.

514
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:54,030
Come. Mr. de CharIus Ioves chatting
with the kitchen boys.

515
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,674
No doubt we'II find him thriving.

516
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,795
Mr. de Foix,

517
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,914
is something Iacking?

518
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,236
As usuaI, but no matter.

519
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,874
You Iook so busy,
I'II do your job.

520
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,319
Keeping warm in here?
Good idea.

521
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,669
Give him a drink.

522
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,793
Look at our game.

523
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,679
The fIags are war zones.

524
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,273
Thank you. Just a sip.

525
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,149
We're studying
German troop movements.

526
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,794
Antoine says we keep screwing up.

527
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,073
I don't.
I say Fritz caIIs aII the shots.

528
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,508
There's some caviar.

529
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,756
No thanks.
I'm Iooking for CharIus.

530
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,313
You missed him.

531
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,751
He saw me and Ieft,
as if I were the deviI.

532
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,598
I'm not a deviI, am I?

533
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,429
No, Your Highness.
Those are the deviIs.

534
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,948
Take a seat.

535
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,597
Have you seen this?
Read it to me pIease.

536
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,671
German-Iovers make merry in Paris,

537
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,792
feasting and partying
despite the war.

538
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,831
Worse, they praise our foes

539
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,032
and wish aIoud
for France's defeat.

540
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,396
I was thinking
that more and more peopIe,

541
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,034
despite seeming perfectIy happy

542
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,708
and drinking exceIIent cocktaiIs,

543
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,868
compIain that
they can't Iast out the war,

544
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:51,154
that their hearts can't take it,
that they'II drop dead.

545
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,717
And strangeIy enough, they do!

546
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,232
I've noted
many such premature deaths.

547
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,193
Have a drink? An armagnac?

548
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,594
Some hot miIk.

549
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,713
In midsummer? Sheer foIIy!

550
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,598
To each his foIIy.

551
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,389
How is Odette?

552
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,268
StiII crazy about the EngIish?
She'd Iike my brother.

553
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,629
AII this absurd taIk

554
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,150
about the extraordinary
Iack of psychoIogy

555
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,635
that characterizes the German race.

556
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,912
The Cottards, the Cambremers...
Between us,

557
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,352
do you think they ever cared much
about psychoIogy?

558
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,831
Norpois is more subtIe,
I grant you,

559
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,828
though he's been wrong
from the start.

560
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:46,355
His rabbIe-rousing
newspaper stories...

561
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,079
Do you read them?

562
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,759
Yes, occasionaIIy.

563
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,873
Brichot says that France
shouId be more miIitaristic

564
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,709
whiIe accusing Germany
of being too much so!

565
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:03,233
He uses the harshest words to
condemn the Germans cuIt of strength

566
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,557
A dragon on its horse!

567
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,156
A beautifuI image, I think.

568
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,069
Don't you?

569
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:20,479
AII these patriotic journaIists
are so untaIented.

570
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,877
That's why they write such driveI.

571
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,719
They aII speII koIossaI
with a k

572
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,878
but what we bow down to

573
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,032
is truIy coIossaI.

574
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,312
Speaking of Brichot,
have you seen MoreI?

575
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,593
I've heard he wants to see me.
Let him make the first move.

576
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,871
I'm the oIder one.

577
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,590
It's not for me to do it.

578
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,596
He was at Mrs. Verdurin's today.

579
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:52,273
He pIayed German dances
and nobody noticed!

580
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,673
He's crazy about women.
That's aII he thinks about.

581
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,193
There's the aII-cIear siren.

582
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,680
Doesn't it remind you of Wagner?

583
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,792
WaIkyries shrieking in the night?

584
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:24,435
The onIy German music
aIIowed since the war began.

585
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,989
In case you didn't know, my dear,

586
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,112
I've been at TansonviIIe
for 2 years now.

587
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,675
I got here when the Germans did.

588
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,556
Everyone tried to dissuade me,
saying I was mad.

589
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,475
But I have one quaIity:
I'm no coward.

590
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,475
Or, if you prefer, I'm IoyaI.

591
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,996
Knowing TansonviIIe was at risk,

592
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,310
I couIdn't Iet our oId steward
defend it aIone.

593
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,434
As a resuIt, I've saved
aImost the entire property,

594
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,595
whiIe nearby estates
were abandoned in panic

595
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,158
and aImost aII destroyed.

596
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,711
I saved not onIy the house

597
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:15,716
but aIso my dear papa's
beIoved coIIections.

598
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:20,233
You can't imagine what this war
is Iike, my dear friend.

599
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,315
The importance
of every road, bridge and hiII...

600
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,356
I often think of you

601
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,031
and our waIks,
which you made so deIightfuI,

602
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,315
as we ambIed through this scenery

603
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,639
that now Iies ravaged,

604
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:42,715
ripped by battIes to capture a road
or hiIItop that you once Ioved,

605
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,990
where we often went together.

606
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,874
WeII,
these pIaces are as famous now

607
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:54,593
as AusterIitz and VaImy. The battIe
of MesegIise Iasted 8 months.

608
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,029
The Germans Iost 600,000 men.

609
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,357
They razed MesegIise
but faiIed to take it.

610
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,676
That country road you Ioved,

611
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,195
the one we caIIed Hawthorn HiII,

612
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,555
where you say
you feII in Iove with me as a chiId,

613
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:16,351
though I swear it was I
who feII in Iove with you...

614
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,557
I got your note.
Is it reaIIy that bad?

615
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,712
I think it's the end.

616
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,552
He was deIirious Iast night.

617
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,036
Then...

618
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,629
he came to himseIf, briefIy.

619
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,796
He said he had to get ready.

620
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:51,238
He'd attended so many deathbeds.
Now it was his turn.

621
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,391
He wanted to Ieave
his papers in order.

622
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,314
Then he said

623
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,032
he'd Iike to see you
one Iast time.

624
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,272
You'd aIways been
a faithfuI friend.

625
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,478
Thank you so much
for coming so fast.

626
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,796
It's Mrs. de ForcheviIIe.

627
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,995
Odette...

628
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,513
Make yourseIf comfortabIe.
It's so hot.

629
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,319
Thank you for coming.

630
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,789
Come here.

631
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,874
CIoser.

632
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,271
Do you know what I'II miss?

633
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,312
Your caresses.

634
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,114
PIease,

635
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,354
one Iast time.

636
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,875
Over there.

637
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:02,549
The box.

638
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,269
Open it.

639
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,988
It's for you.

640
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,149
Yes...

641
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,153
Make me happy.

642
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,314
The worst is aIways unexpected.

643
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,512
I aIways used to think

644
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,508
the worst that couId happen to me

645
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,438
wouId be that he'd go.

646
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,911
And Ieave me aII aIone.

647
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,155
But I was wrong.

648
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,909
The worst thing

649
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,313
was when I found her Ietters.

650
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:55,078
He'd been two-timing me for years
with that tramp!

651
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,755
It's good that you feeI so sad.

652
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,231
It proves you Iove stiII him.

653
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,953
FeeIing Iess sad wouId mean
that you're forgetting him.

654
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,552
That you Iove him Iess.

655
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,274
You mustn't think
he didn't Iove you.

656
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,672
When he was unfaithfuI,

657
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:24,471
he took such pains to hide it

658
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,556
for fear of hurting you.

659
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,278
He respected you.

660
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,599
He preferred you.

661
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:40,950
My earring!

662
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,232
I've Iost my earring!

663
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,198
I'm gIad to see you.

664
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,112
Me too.
I feeI better aIready.

665
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,393
I'm onIy sorry
you can't stay Ionger.

666
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,558
Here in Paris,
we hardIy feeI the war.

667
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,152
You're a changed man!

668
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,158
I remember you saying

669
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,831
when peopIe refuse to fight,
it's because they don't want to die.

670
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,554
They're just scared.

671
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,072
You said you yourseIf were scared
to return to duty.

672
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,439
I guess you were just being witty.

673
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,752
I remember.
BIoch had just been caIIed up...

674
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,473
I toId them.

675
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,671
I'm no use. BIind as a bat!

676
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,073
What's so funny?

677
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,556
You're safe,
parading around at staff HQ

678
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,069
whiIe pIain privates Iike me

679
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,829
get butchered by BiII.
No thanks!

680
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:57,589
- I hear Kaiser WiIheIm's sick.
- CaII him BiII.

681
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,432
ExactIy. You're scared to.

682
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,310
You groveI to him aIready.

683
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,790
You'd Iook good at the front,

684
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,397
Iicking Fritz's boots!

685
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,958
You know what you are?

686
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,115
PriviIeged dandies pIaying at war!

687
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:18,870
Come.

688
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,712
WiII it Iast Iong?

689
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,399
What? No.

690
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,035
I anticipate a very short war.

691
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,709
Read the Armies Act
of October 28th, 1913.

692
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,435
Give me that, and that...
A IittIe pot-pourri.

693
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:42,869
Read it, you'II see.

694
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:47,110
There are no pIans
to repIenish the reserves.

695
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,472
That proves the war won't Iast Iong.

696
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:58,552
If I enIist,
it wiII be for an ideaI.

697
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:04,196
I agree with my UncIe CharIus.
Effeminacy has no pIace in a man.

698
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,796
The thing that appeaIs to me

699
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,151
is being with brave young men,
far from women.

700
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,630
You understand? I beIieve in...

701
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:19,515
the mentaI and moraI nobiIity
of manIy friendships.

702
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,353
I'd Iove to risk my Iife
to save my orderIy.

703
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:27,678
I'd Iove to die inspiring my men
with fanaticaI Iove.

704
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:34,635
PhiIippe d'OrIeans, a connoisseur
of young men and effeminacy,

705
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,997
- was caIIed Monsieur...
- I know, thanks!

706
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,198
A hero of the Dutch war, right?

707
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,876
But he was a quirk.

708
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:50,829
This is aII very uninteresting,
MarceI.

709
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,033
You remember the beIIhop at BaIbec?

710
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,272
He wants to join up, as an airman.
I'II see if I can heIp.

711
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,230
- Good journey, sir?
- No.

712
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,079
How's Mr. St-Loup?

713
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,556
Isn't he due for some sea air?

714
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:11,875
I've no idea.

715
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,234
TeII me, friend.

716
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,950
Between you and me.

717
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,513
I've heard that Mr. St-Loup

718
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,678
appreciates young men

719
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,348
in a particuIar way.

720
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,355
I don't go in for that, sir.

721
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,957
And if it were true,
I wouIdn't say.

722
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,990
I respect the hoteI's guests.

723
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,793
When I caIIed you earIier,
Francoise asked me

724
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,398
to exempt
some butcher's boy she Iikes.

725
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,119
A shy IittIe chap.

726
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,758
She combed Paris for him.

727
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,998
He'd changed butchers.

728
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,358
She wants to save his skin.

729
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:05,919
What did you teII her?

730
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,555
That I don't exempt anyone.

731
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,439
You haven't eaten a thing.

732
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,593
You'II waste away.

733
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,672
We need manpower!

734
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,673
Some days
I'm too weak to hoId a pen.

735
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,632
Can you see me with a rifIe?

736
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,079
CertainIy not!

737
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,913
You know what I think?

738
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:39,835
It's hard to create an epic
using words Iike Up and at 'em!

739
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,956
They grate on my ears.

740
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,830
It sounds so affected.
So vuIgar!

741
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,596
Like saying coke
instead of cocain.

742
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,590
The common peopIe, though,

743
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,949
Laborers...

744
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:09,073
Shopkeepers
who never dreamed of being heroes,

745
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,993
who'd have died of oId age
without knowing...

746
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,636
When you see them run under fire

747
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:19,196
to rescue a comrade
or a wounded officer

748
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:24,159
and they're hit, they die smiIing.
You know why?

749
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:29,479
Because the surgeon toId them
we captured the trench.

750
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,836
Common peopIe are best!

751
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:43,155
But then again,
everyone's good.

752
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:46,552
Like young Vaugoubert,
the ambassador's boy.

753
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,270
Wounded 7 times before he died!

754
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,790
Each time he returned aIive,
he Iooked apoIogetic,

755
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,797
as if he'd Iet us down !

756
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,318
Good meat!

757
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,713
Do croissants
stiII ease your migraines?

758
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,993
Every morning
I think of poor Cottard.

759
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,319
I feeI so sad.

760
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,509
He had to write me
a prescription for croissants!

761
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,830
The worId's gone haywire.

762
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,997
To have a croissant baked

763
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,033
you have to puII
aImost as many strings

764
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,071
as to appoint a generaI!

765
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,919
Before I forget...

766
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:38,317
I've heard you were
with CharIus yesterday.

767
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,238
Are you friends again?

768
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,231
We ran into each other
in the street.

769
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,710
I imagine it was a shock.

770
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,192
What's the attraction?

771
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,234
The strongman or my friend Rene?

772
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,873
Who's Rene?

773
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,277
A draft-dodger Iike you?

774
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:21,513
Draft-dodger?
Don't sneer at him.

775
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,678
He's very imaginative,
especiaIIy in areas

776
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,393
that interest you.

777
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:29,512
I'II introduce you.
He couId use the money.

778
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:34,077
He and I share the same tastes:
an aIIergy to trenches.

779
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,472
You understand.
You aIways backed the weak.

780
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,358
We're weak. You used to say

781
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,711
you never read the IegaI pages,
out of sympathy

782
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,831
for the condemned man's agony.

783
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:51,116
I don't, but I sometimes
read your fiIthy articIes.

784
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,838
They're onIy a pastime.

785
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:54,995
CharIie...

786
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:59,398
- What do you want?
- To spend the evening with you.

787
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,795
- Evening and night?
- Yes.

788
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:10,952
Sorry.
I have better pIans.

789
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:12,468
Coming, Rene?

790
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,509
CharIie!

791
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,120
Look out.
I'II get even!

792
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,236
I aImost forgot!

793
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,349
It's time.

794
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:36,474
VinteuiI's septet.

795
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,110
Good evening.

796
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,919
You, here?

797
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,039
I couId say the same.

798
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,039
I have my reasons.
You too, no doubt.

799
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:41,316
Did you see that man?
Was it Saint-Loup?

800
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,230
- Why not?
- What's so funny?

801
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,276
I'm sure you know
he's been impIicated

802
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,913
in a spy scandaI.

803
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,190
- WrongIy.
- I know.

804
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,958
It's a respectabIe house,
to that extent.

805
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,031
My own father frequented it.

806
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:01,516
Spying on your own father?
Is he in there?

807
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,348
He's dead.

808
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,154
He died in there.

809
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,756
What can we do?
When it's our turn, we'II go.

810
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,313
To sIaughter? Not me.

811
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:58,429
I'm 22. Six months as a nurse there
was enough. FaceIess patients.

812
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,428
My Iast one had no jaw,
no nose, no mouth. Nothing!

813
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,915
Just a big hoIe.
And the stench!

814
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,350
MeanwhiIe Joffre sIeeps around!

815
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,949
I read they have no more zeppeIins.

816
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:13,994
Oh yeah?
I shot down five aIready!

817
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,198
The papers are paid to teII Iies.

818
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:18,875
Excuse me.

819
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,711
I'd Iike a room.

820
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,918
I don't know whom to ask.

821
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,033
Ask the boss.
He's gone to buy chains.

822
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,870
I think room 43 is free.
One night?

823
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,356
No, just a few hours' rest.

824
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,910
I came in from the air raid.

825
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,838
They bombed La ViIIette.

826
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,990
I'm very thirsty.
May I have a drop of cassis ?

827
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,599
We'II send it up.

828
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,753
Anything eIse?
Take your pick.

829
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,428
I'II go with you.

830
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:00,674
Who's he?

831
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,837
Is there a Canadian airman here?

832
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:06,515
French.

833
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,312
No good.

834
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,911
The cIient wants the accent.

835
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,952
Take that, scum!

836
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,951
Maurice? I assure you, Baron.
He's a genuine thug.

837
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,912
ReaIIy?
You surprise me.

838
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:15,314
He's had many convictions
for theft and burgIary.

839
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,469
He's been in jaiI.
He's dangerous.

840
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,195
Maybe so, Jupien,
but I don't feeI it.

841
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,479
He says scum Iike a schooIboy
reciting by rote.

842
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,240
Nobody taught him.

843
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,599
I find him much too gentIe.

844
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,196
GentIe is not why I come here.

845
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,634
GentIe? He was wanted
for kiIIing a concierge!

846
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,237
Now you're taIking!

847
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,038
There's the man
from the sIaughterhouse.

848
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:53,910
He can kiII an ox with one finger.
Guaranteed iIIiterate.

849
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:57,154
A Senator tried him two days ago.

850
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,954
He spoke about him to Mr. Lebrun.

851
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,554
Mr. Lebrun is actuaIIy
the Russian Grand Duke.

852
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:10,750
Don't bother, Jupien.
I want boys Iike Maurice.

853
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:12,951
He has the right approach,

854
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,594
but I want more authenticity.

855
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,274
Find someone.

856
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,191
Is my driver waiting?

857
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,113
Of course.

858
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,831
But the raid's not over.

859
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,953
He didn't hesitate one second.

860
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,673
He chose to die.

861
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,235
To save his orderIy's Iife?

862
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,751
The rich aren't aII bad.

863
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,948
I'd happiIy die for guys Iike that.

864
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,397
They're the tops.
Poor stiffs Iike us

865
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,831
have nothing to Iose.
A gentIeman with servants

866
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:50,238
who couId be home drinking
cocktaiIs, that's reaI cIass.

867
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:55,078
God shouIdn't Iet the rich die.
The workers need them.

868
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:58,636
For one of them kiIIed,
every German shouId die.

869
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,951
Finished aIready?

870
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,113
That was short.

871
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,438
Short for a waIk in the park.

872
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:10,916
Long if you're swinging a whip
in this heat.

873
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,351
Good thing he pays weII.

874
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:17,035
He's educated too,
you can teII.

875
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,549
Damn it.
He's insane!

876
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,910
- Who is?
- The oId man in 27.

877
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:23,599
He's never satisfied.

878
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:27,315
Thugs bore him, soIdiers too.
Now he wants a crippIe.

879
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,829
But not a veteran.
He hates that.

880
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:34,591
A crippIe who wasn't wounded at war?
There's no such thing!

881
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:47,759
Not that chair!

882
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,152
Get up, get up!

883
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:54,148
The Prince de Foix died
in that chair. Nobody sits there.

884
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,472
Put the roses on it.

885
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:06,358
Hide, before the Baron sees you.

886
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,755
Hide!

887
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:11,470
Get up.

888
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,593
The Baron's coming.

889
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,672
You're disgusting.

890
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:36,997
I saw you at the OIympia
with two tickets.

891
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:40,078
Making extra money
behind my back?

892
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,395
No, sir.

893
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:46,230
How sweet. You say it so weII.
It aImost sounds true.

894
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:49,079
Who cares if it's true or not,

895
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,475
as Iong as I beIieve it?

896
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:57,074
Think about me in the trenches.
Is it heII?

897
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:01,717
Sometimes, when the sheIIs
come cIose. But we have no choice.

898
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:04,231
We'II fight to the end.

899
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:08,035
To the end.
But to the end of what?

900
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:14,999
I don't think I know this charming,

901
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,589
deIicious young man.

902
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:28,355
I'm charmed, sir.
DeIighted to meet you.

903
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:39,637
I'II send it to my parents
and to my brother,

904
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,239
at the front.

905
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,153
How awfuI.

906
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,239
He's a decent guy, for a baron.

907
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,670
He has a miIIion a day to spend.

908
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,076
PIease don't take it badIy.

909
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:13,397
The same room tomorrow.
11 o'cIock in the morning.

910
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,874
Yes, sir.

911
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:22,468
Maurice! Louis!
You're wanted in room 23.

912
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,070
Look what I found in 35.

913
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,189
What is it?

914
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,914
A Croix de Guerre. Thanks!
Where was it?

915
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:33,078
Room 35.
I think I know whose it is.

916
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:37,832
Hurry, he's important.
Don't keep him waiting.

917
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,234
I'II see you out.

918
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,752
What's he doing here?

919
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,155
I'm Ieaving.

920
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:47,358
I can't beIieve it!

921
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,838
I won't be back.
It's scandaIous.

922
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,468
ScandaIous!

923
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:53,669
Goodbye!

924
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,037
I onIy bring one thing:
my mother's photo.

925
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,312
You're right.

926
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,078
You onIy have one mother.

927
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:16,430
One thing's for sure.
Since these raids began,

928
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,520
I've found the way of the Lord.

929
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,469
A few more raids,
and you'II be an aIcohoIic.

930
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:45,670
Francoise!
What's upset you so?

931
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,279
We thought you were dead!

932
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:49,473
Didn't we?

933
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,432
The idea was discussed.

934
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,150
The bombs feII cIose tonight.

935
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:02,635
Guess who fetched us
from the ceIIar. Mr. de Saint-Loup!

936
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,039
What a character!

937
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,877
Ordering me around

938
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,633
Iike I was his sergeant!
Wasn't he?

939
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:17,789
He swore he'd Ieft his cross here.

940
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,718
His Croix de Guerre.

941
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:24,919
You wonder how he won it.

942
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,793
If you ask me,
rich peopIe Iike him

943
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,639
sit pretty
whiIe the rest get kiIIed.

944
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,159
AIso, he has a nerve

945
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:35,909
teIIing us
how brave the Germans are.

946
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:37,792
Which side is he on?

947
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,391
So what did you do?
Don't say he stayed in the ceIIar!

948
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,918
l'd love to hear Morel
play this sonata.

949
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,192
Can l meet him one day?

950
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,997
ShaII I warm up some food?

951
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,668
No thank you.
You may go to bed.

952
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,714
Guess what Mr. de St-Loup said.

953
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:19,150
Fritz is waiting
for the pear to drop.

954
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,989
It's true.
That day, there'II be no mercy.

955
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:27,159
HoIy Mary! The invadement
of BeIgium was bad enough.

956
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,033
Poor, defendIess IittIe country.

957
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:34,315
What about the medaI?
Did you go up and get it?

958
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:38,149
Yes. We risked our Iives.
For nothing!

959
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,237
Not even a tip.

960
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:44,431
CharIus came by.
He Ieft a note.

961
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:05,310
Morel is hiding at 25 AAvenue
du Bois. l dare not go myself.

962
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,511
PIease foIIow me.

963
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,879
It's here.

964
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,669
He's coming.

965
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,558
Who toId you I was here?

966
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:46,797
Odette.
She's worried about you.

967
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:51,629
You're joking.
Odette doesn't worry about anyone.

968
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:53,470
So?

969
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,071
So I wanted to taIk to you.

970
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:01,150
It's smaII and uncomfortabIe here.
Have a seat.

971
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,430
WeIcome to my hideout.

972
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,756
The poIice are after me.

973
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:15,229
I'm wanted.

974
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,273
As a deserter.

975
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,599
Who turned me in?

976
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:23,278
Any idea?

977
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,476
I don't want to die in ignorance

978
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,879
in front of the firing squad.

979
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:32,998
I won't stay Iong.

980
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:36,758
It can't have been CharIus.
You know it.

981
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,557
He hasn't got it in him.

982
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,637
- I didn't suspect him.
- So?

983
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,679
Maybe it's time
to end your quarreI.

984
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:46,995
He's oId.

985
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,038
He may die soon.

986
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,758
It's time to make peace.

987
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:56,319
It's aII the more absurd
because he stiII Ioves you.

988
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,874
He's stiII wiIIing to heIp you.

989
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,151
You're wasting your time.

990
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:07,433
TeII me why you won't make peace.

991
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:12,273
Are you too Iazy? Too mean?
Too virtuous? Too vain?

992
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,599
Nothing of the sort.

993
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:21,516
I don't care about virtue.

994
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:23,999
Meanness?

995
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:28,114
No, I've begun to pity myseIf.
Vanity is pointIess.

996
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,589
As for being Iazy...

997
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,715
I'm Iike a caged animaI.

998
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,397
The truth is...

999
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,993
I'm a fooI to teII you.
The truth is, I'm scared.

1000
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,079
I'm scared of him.

1001
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:51,311
I don't understand.
You know he's a good man.

1002
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,195
Yes, I know.
I know aII that.

1003
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:58,632
So considerate, so upright...
I know. I'm ashamed to say it,

1004
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,795
but I'm scared.

1005
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,474
PIease go now.
Leave me aIone.

1006
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,316
Every day of our battIe
against the invader

1007
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:26,636
is written in history.

1008
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:32,029
In the dark trenches,
in the Iine of fire,

1009
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:35,949
when victory is at stake,
the names of commanders

1010
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:39,994
become one with those
of the humbIest soIdiers.

1011
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:45,956
Marquis Robert de Saint-Loup
died on the fieId of honor.

1012
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:52,594
That he gave his Iife is enough

1013
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,153
to make him great.

1014
01:27:56,720 --> 01:28:01,271
But that he did so
to protect his men

1015
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:06,995
makes him a hero.

1016
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:27,553
Mentioned in dispatches,

1017
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:31,594
awarded the Croix de Guerre,
Robert de Saint-Loup...

1018
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:16,553
The Marquise de ViIIeparisis!
I thought she was in Paris.

1019
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:20,992
My dear friend... What a surprise!
I thought you were in Paris.

1020
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:26,398
Aren't you're the son
of the Minister's secretary?

1021
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:29,269
This is Robert de Saint-Loup.

1022
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:34,073
And my nephew,
Baron de Guermantes.

1023
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:37,676
My goodness!
What am I saying?

1024
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:40,629
I caIIed you Baron de Guermantes!

1025
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:43,877
PIease meet...
Baron de CharIus.

1026
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:46,870
What did you do today?

1027
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:52,515
I must show you the sweet shop
that just opened.

1028
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,155
I'II waIk with you a bit.

1029
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,038
TeII me...

1030
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:05,311
Did Madame say your uncIe CharIus
is a Guermantes?

1031
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,319
Yes, she did.

1032
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,631
He's PaIamede de Guermantes.

1033
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:15,517
The Guermantes of Combray,

1034
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:18,394
descendants of Genevieve de Brabant?

1035
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,715
AbsoIuteIy.

1036
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,875
CharIus adores heraIdry.

1037
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:27,311
He says that our motto,
our cri de guerre,

1038
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:32,317
which is now Passavant,
used to be Combraysis.

1039
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,310
CharIus' brother
owns the chateau at Combray.

1040
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:42,955
If you Iike,
I'II introduce you again.

1041
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,230
After supper
is the time he reIishes most.

1042
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:50,230
UncIe CharIus is a night owI.

1043
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:05,038
Isn't that Robert de Saint-Loup?

1044
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:06,355
Where?

1045
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:09,150
There.

1046
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:11,598
I can't see anyone.

1047
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:13,556
Come...

1048
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,636
Combraysis!

1049
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:43,199
Poor woman.

1050
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:47,191
She must have cried so
after her son's death.

1051
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:50,035
They didn't even Iet her see him.

1052
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:53,232
Mind you...
just as weII, perhaps.

1053
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:58,317
I hear his nose was spIit in two.
CompIeteIy defaced...

1054
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:02,599
Look who's coming.

1055
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:05,677
What a nerve!

1056
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,430
Here comes my favorite vioIinist.

1057
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:24,871
He Iooks as grim... as death!

1058
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:33,395
Where have you been?
I was worried!

1059
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:36,592
I missed the action.
Don't worry about me.

1060
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,837
I have company.
They were waiting at the station.

1061
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:45,436
I'm a ceIebrity now.
They'II aII Iap it up.

1062
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:46,834
Mr. MoreI...

1063
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:49,878
your presence here...

1064
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:54,317
I won't be staying Iong.

1065
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:19,273
CharIie...

1066
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:46,877
Thank you for coming.

1067
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,600
We can't Iet them do this!

1068
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:54,676
We have to do something!

1069
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:58,634
Where's Odette?
She's friends with the GeneraI.

1070
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,430
I'd Iike a IittIe pick-me-up.

1071
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:30,671
Come, Oriane...

1072
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:28,432
The new sanitarium
to which l withdrew

1073
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:31,074
did me no more good than the first.

1074
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:32,959
The war was over.

1075
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:37,030
On the train back to Paris,

1076
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:40,118
the thought of my lack
of literary talent,

1077
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:44,598
which l'd recognized while
skimming the Goncourts'Journal,

1078
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:48,674
the thought of the vanity
and falsehood of literature

1079
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:53,431
struck me afresh,
more painfully than ever before.

1080
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:24,553
- How are you?
- WeII.

1081
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:26,557
The Baron wants to see you.

1082
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,478
Mr. de CharIus...

1083
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,513
How are you?

1084
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:40,518
Better,
but don't mention his iIIness.

1085
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:44,715
You're stiII aIive.
Thank God.

1086
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:48,670
Because my famiIy...

1087
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:52,515
My famiIy...

1088
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,551
His famiIy is nearIy extinct.

1089
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,119
The newspapers.

1090
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,276
Antoine de Mouchy... dead.

1091
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:12,437
CharIes Swann... dead.

1092
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:17,319
AdaIbert de Montmorency... dead.

1093
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:21,555
Boson de TaIIeyrand... dead.

1094
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,390
Sosthene de DoudeauviIIe... dead.

1095
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:43,155
That's Mrs. de Saint-Euverte.
You hate her.

1096
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:45,431
Mrs. de Saint-Euverte!

1097
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:47,790
I'm not deaf, Jupien.

1098
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:53,518
Now I've made someone happy,
for a few minutes.

1099
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:56,957
He thinks I'm Iosing my mind.
I am not.

1100
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,237
You see that advertisement?

1101
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:16,796
There was the same one
at Avranches...

1102
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:17,830
No...

1103
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:19,953
at BaIbec.

1104
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:23,871
When I met you for the first time.

1105
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:25,798
Do you remember?

1106
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:06,234
MarceI!

1107
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,637
Your grandmother Iooks fIustered.

1108
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:52,789
But we don't care about oId grandma.
Do we, IittIe rascaI?

1109
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:55,880
Pardon me, sir?
I adore her!

1110
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:59,196
Sir, you're stiII young.

1111
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:02,631
Use your youth to Iearn two things.

1112
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:07,960
First, refrain
from dispIaying emotions

1113
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:10,799
that are best Ieft unspoken.

1114
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:15,790
Second, don't rush
into answering questions

1115
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,151
before you've understood them.

1116
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:22,079
If you take these precautions,

1117
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,633
you wiII be saved

1118
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:28,593
from bIurting out nonsense

1119
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:30,751
as if you were deaf.

1120
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:34,072
You Iook siIIy enough aIready

1121
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:39,274
with anchors embroidered
on your swimsuit.

1122
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,396
I toId you you'd be coId.

1123
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:50,319
Your Iips are purpIe!

1124
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:52,309
You're shivering.

1125
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:28,316
The Princess de Guermantes insists.
No entry during the concert.

1126
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:30,596
I'II show you to the Iibrary.

1127
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:39,116
I'II bring you some cakes and tea.

1128
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,110
Tea?

1129
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:28,596
MiIk?

1130
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,153
No thank you.

1131
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:31,793
- Sugar?
- One.

1132
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:47,153
That day, the signs
which lessened my discouragement

1133
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:51,592
and restored my faith in writing
seemed to multiply around me.

1134
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:55,795
lf memory,
thanks to the act of forgetting,

1135
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,470
offers no bridge
from itself to the present,

1136
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:02,718
it allows us to breathe a new air.

1137
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:06,351
New, because
we've breathed it before.

1138
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:11,435
Poets tried vainly
to situate this air in paradise,

1139
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:14,957
but true paradises
are those we have lost.

1140
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:19,511
This meant that
my fear of my own death

1141
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:24,430
stopped as soon as l recalled
the taste of the madeleine.

1142
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:29,270
AAt that moment, the person
l had been became extra-temporal.

1143
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:34,111
That person existed outside
of activity, of immediate enjoyment,

1144
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:38,472
each time the miracle of analogy
made me escape from the present.

1145
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:41,720
l felt no pleasure at Balbec,

1146
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:44,070
or when l lived with AAlbertine.

1147
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:47,113
l felt it only after the fact.

1148
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:49,834
l had to interpret sensations

1149
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:52,395
like signs of laws and ideas,

1150
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:54,113
trying to think,

1151
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:58,199
to pull what l'd once felt
out from the shadows,

1152
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:01,790
to convert it
into its spiritual equivalent.

1153
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,356
The only means of doing so

1154
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:08,028
was to create a work of art.

1155
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:11,394
Why is MarceI crying so?

1156
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:14,194
Even he doesn't know.
He's keyed up.

1157
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:18,189
Prepare the big bed for me.
I'II sIeep in here.

1158
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:23,315
My IittIe ninny makes Mama
as siIIy as he.

1159
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:27,749
Since neither of us is tired,
Iet's not get keyed up.

1160
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:29,598
Let's do something.

1161
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:31,872
WiII it spoiI your fun

1162
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:36,631
if I give you the books
Grandmother bought for your birthday?

1163
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:41,395
Are you sure?

1164
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:45,674
It wiII mean
you get nothing tomorrow.

1165
01:48:57,160 --> 01:49:00,596
We were waIking home
in the moonIight

1166
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:04,635
which cast a siIver gIow
on the dark country paths.

1167
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:08,909
It was an autumn evening,
miId and sIightIy misty.

1168
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:12,869
We couIdn't heIp noticing
the sound of the air

1169
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:16,834
and something eerie
which hovers over nature...

1170
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:23,039
The first piece is over.
May I see you in?

1171
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:01,436
How nice to see you,

1172
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:03,073
my oIdest friend!

1173
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:06,513
This reminds me of the year

1174
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:09,393
I first visited
the Princess de Guermantes.

1175
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:13,315
I feared I was unweIcome
and wouId be turned away.

1176
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:17,191
You were wearing a red dress
and red shoes.

1177
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:21,109
My God...
AII that was so Iong ago.

1178
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:25,756
Those were the dresses
we wore back then.

1179
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:31,919
Maybe they'II come back. Fashions
do - cIothes, music, painting.

1180
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:36,878
But you, dear friend, don't change.
Not one white hair.

1181
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:39,310
You Iook as young as ever.

1182
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:41,955
I thought I just saw MoreI.

1183
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:44,119
I doubt it.

1184
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:46,272
He'd have greeted me.

1185
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:48,758
Is he reaIIy invited?

1186
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:53,511
What a question!
MoreI is now highIy respected.

1187
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:55,915
The Princess is fond of him.

1188
01:51:56,120 --> 01:51:58,111
What's troubIing you?

1189
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,753
Nothing...

1190
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:03,600
I didn't recognize that man...

1191
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:06,236
I was toId it's Mr. d'Argencourt.

1192
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:09,159
Rather... what's Ieft of him.

1193
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,878
You're referring to the triaI?

1194
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:15,799
CharIus and d'Argencourt
were convicted.

1195
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,276
The court deferred
to the high moraI standards

1196
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:21,516
of our friend MoreI.

1197
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:27,793
But reIax. If d'Argencourt
shouId bump into MoreI,

1198
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,195
he'II greet him Iike an oId friend.

1199
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:33,836
So oId...
that he won't remember him!

1200
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,276
If you come across GiIberte,
avoid her.

1201
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:44,996
She's a tramp who never Ioved
her husband. She Iiked the status,

1202
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:49,034
the name, being my niece,
and rising from her sIime.

1203
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:51,913
AII she wants now
is to sink back into it.

1204
01:52:52,120 --> 01:52:55,510
It's aIways pained me
because of poor Robert.

1205
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:59,389
He was no hawk,
but he saw things cIearIy.

1206
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:01,431
A great many things!

1207
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:04,872
I have no proof of her infideIity,

1208
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:09,756
but rumors abounded.
That's why Robert enIisted.

1209
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:12,952
The war deIivered him
from his sorrow.

1210
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:17,153
If you ask me, he wasn't kiIIed.
He got himseIf kiIIed.

1211
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:29,074
My dear friend.

1212
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:33,158
OId chap...
How good to see you.

1213
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:35,351
You Iook fit for a dying man.

1214
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:38,590
PIease meet Mrs. de Farcy.

1215
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:43,509
She's American.
So witty and ever so eIegant!

1216
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:46,997
Stop it, Jacques.
You'II make me bIush!

1217
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:48,236
Jacques?

1218
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:49,953
I changed my name.

1219
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,434
You didn't know?
I'm Jacques du Rozier now.

1220
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:57,156
- Why change AIbert?
- AIbert BIoch is over.

1221
01:53:57,720 --> 01:54:00,792
You don't read the papers.
I wrote an articIe

1222
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:03,993
for which I've received much praise.

1223
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:08,233
But teII me...
Since you know everyone here...

1224
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:11,350
I'd Iike to meet
the Prince de Guermantes.

1225
01:54:11,640 --> 01:54:13,517
ReaIIy? You know everyone?

1226
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:15,676
A reaI sociaI butterfIy.

1227
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:20,357
This is aII untrue.
AIIow me...

1228
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:23,350
Prince? Excuse me...

1229
01:54:24,160 --> 01:54:24,990
Prince?

1230
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,991
This is my friend AIbert.

1231
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:31,034
Jacques... Jacques du Rozier.

1232
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,834
I've heard a Iot about you.

1233
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:40,032
And your Iate father,
SoIomon BIoch.

1234
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:42,835
Isn't that so?

1235
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:46,152
Yes. Indeed.

1236
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:52,277
Excuse me, I'm a IittIe...
What's the word?

1237
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:55,119
A IittIe new to this society.

1238
01:54:55,880 --> 01:55:00,078
My husband, Count de Farcy,
is reIated to the ForcheviIIes.

1239
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:03,553
It's a very grand famiIy, isn't it?

1240
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:09,156
I made a note
that Mrs. de Saint-Loup

1241
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:13,911
is reIated to the Prince
de Guermantes by the ForcheviIIes.

1242
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:18,717
You noted wrong.
It's a very big mistake.

1243
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:25,076
I toId it to a Iady
who repeated it to a man...

1244
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:27,357
- It's of no importance.
- The Duchess...

1245
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,592
Do you recognize me?

1246
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:44,154
Cambremer.

1247
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:48,111
The Marquis de Cambremer.

1248
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:51,512
Excuse me.
Of course I recognize you.

1249
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:55,236
I heard you were aiIing.

1250
01:55:55,640 --> 01:55:57,676
The same troubIe breathing?

1251
01:55:57,880 --> 01:56:01,111
It hasn't hindered your Iongevity.

1252
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:04,153
It's Iike this deadIy fIu epidemic.

1253
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:08,353
It seems that its victims
are mostIy young.

1254
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:10,073
We're stiII safe.

1255
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:15,308
We stiII have...
a IittIe time before us, don't we?

1256
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:18,359
Montesquiou!

1257
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,992
The concert wiII now begin.

1258
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:05,348
I pIay it badIy.

1259
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:07,956
No. Keep pIaying.

1260
02:00:09,120 --> 02:00:11,759
I'd Iike to hear MoreI
pIay this sonata.

1261
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:14,112
Can I meet him one day?

1262
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:17,994
VinteuiI's music is so monotonous.

1263
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,036
The same phrases, over and over.

1264
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:23,278
It puts me to sIeep.

1265
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:34,199
If it weren't so Iate, AIbertine,

1266
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:37,029
I'd show you how these key phrases,

1267
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:40,472
which you've begun to recognize
as I do,

1268
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:44,475
the same ones in the sonata,
the septet,

1269
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:46,558
and his other works,

1270
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:50,956
that IittIe music
which keeps coming back,

1271
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:53,795
insistentIy,

1272
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:58,036
which you write off as monotonous.

1273
02:00:58,600 --> 02:00:59,669
WeII...

1274
02:01:01,400 --> 02:01:02,992
in Iiterature,

1275
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:05,950
good Iiterature, that is...

1276
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:10,671
It's Iike a hidden reaIity

1277
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:13,870
reveaIed by a materiaI trace.

1278
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:18,078
Look at the stonecutters
in Thomas Hardy.

1279
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:21,030
They're in Jude the Obscure.

1280
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:23,796
AIso in The WeII-BeIoved.

1281
02:01:24,640 --> 02:01:29,077
Remember the stones
the father hews out of the isIand,

1282
02:01:30,720 --> 02:01:35,077
coming by boats
to piIe up in the son's workshop.

1283
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:37,398
They become statues.

1284
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:42,835
The paraIIeIs
between The WeII-BeIoved,

1285
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:46,114
in which a man Ioves three women

1286
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:48,632
and A Pair of BIue Eyes

1287
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:54,437
in which a woman Ioves three men...

1288
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:56,910
These paraIIeIs...

1289
02:01:58,440 --> 02:01:59,759
You're not Iistening.

1290
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:01,793
Yes, I am.

1291
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:05,878
But I wish I hadn't mentioned MoreI.

1292
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:10,793
That's the reaIity
I read in your face.

1293
02:02:12,280 --> 02:02:13,474
What do you see?

1294
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:18,549
A trace of jeaIousy.

1295
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:20,793
Am I right?

1296
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:23,352
Not entireIy wrong.

1297
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:29,590
And a Ietter
Mr. de CharIus opened by mistake.

1298
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:32,555
A Ietter from Lea to MoreI.

1299
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:36,271
Did she teII you about it?

1300
02:02:38,600 --> 02:02:40,477
I thought as much.

1301
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:45,312
A rather racy Ietter.
She caIIed MoreI a IittIe bitch.

1302
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:47,239
Nice turns of phrase:

1303
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:50,796
Pretty girIie, you're one of us.

1304
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:52,718
But she said it kindIy.

1305
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,149
She read it to you?

1306
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:57,072
Of course she did.

1307
02:02:58,040 --> 02:02:59,439
GiIberte was with Lea.

1308
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:03,312
You're saying that to...

1309
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:05,555
Perhaps.

1310
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:08,112
After aII, I wasn't there.

1311
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:15,433
Did she try anything with you?

1312
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:22,276
On rainy days,
her parents sent a carriage.

1313
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:24,558
Once she gave me a ride.

1314
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:26,839
She kissed me.

1315
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:30,630
She even asked if I Iiked women.

1316
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:35,438
I said yes.
Just for the fun of confusing her.

1317
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:38,073
That's aII.

1318
02:03:40,240 --> 02:03:41,912
We didn't go any further.

1319
02:07:26,440 --> 02:07:29,591
You mistook me for Mama.

1320
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:32,394
I'm starting to Iook Iike her.

1321
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:37,273
I was short of breath.

1322
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:39,990
There are so many peopIe.

1323
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:42,153
The party's a success.

1324
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:45,238
I won't be staying Iong.

1325
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:49,232
I keep thinking about Robert.

1326
02:07:50,280 --> 02:07:52,032
I know how you admired him.

1327
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:55,875
I was abIe to grasp
what a superior being he was.

1328
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:03,799
Even now, I'm stiII struck
by his sIightest remarks.

1329
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,719
His amazing foresight about the war.

1330
02:08:07,080 --> 02:08:10,675
He wasn't wrong...
about the airpIanes.

1331
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:12,677
Remember when he said...

1332
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:16,716
He spoke so beautifuIIy...

1333
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:20,197
Each army
must be a hundred-eyed Argus.

1334
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:22,233
Poetic, isn't it?

1335
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:26,076
But what brings you
to these crowded parties?

1336
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:29,756
You, amid such carnage!

1337
02:08:29,960 --> 02:08:31,871
It doesn't fit you.

1338
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:36,278
I'd expect you anywhere except
one of my aunt's big hoopIas.

1339
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:38,752
Because she is my aunt.

1340
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:47,037
Don't teII me you didn't know.

1341
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:50,393
Where have you been?

1342
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:53,753
In my sanitarium.

1343
02:08:58,160 --> 02:09:02,676
That bejeweIed thing pecking at her
cake with her new dentures...

1344
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,274
Do you recognize her?

1345
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:12,669
The new Princess de Guermantes,
formerIy Sidonie Verdurin.

1346
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:40,874
Virtuosity
can never repIace inspiration.

1347
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:47,149
CharIie!

1348
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:49,239
I'd Iost hope!

1349
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:52,000
So RacheI wiII be reciting Musset?

1350
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:55,156
That was my idea!

1351
02:09:55,920 --> 02:10:00,311
AIfred de Musset's Memory
is my favorite poem!

1352
02:10:07,120 --> 02:10:09,429
My uncIe was ruined by the war.

1353
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:12,228
The Verdurins' fortune
set him right.

1354
02:10:13,480 --> 02:10:16,153
After her husband died,
Mrs. Verdurin

1355
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:19,951
married the Duke de Duras
on his sickbed.

1356
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:24,357
That's how my uncIe,
widower of Princess Hedwige,

1357
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:28,348
married a widow
who'd become a duchess.

1358
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:30,792
Mission accompIished.

1359
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:35,878
She takes herseIf so seriousIy.

1360
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:38,557
And everyone eIse pretends to.

1361
02:10:52,080 --> 02:10:55,152
How are you?
Some champagne?

1362
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:11,750
Did GiIberte do
her grieving widow act.

1363
02:11:12,160 --> 02:11:14,355
She feeIs no grief at aII.

1364
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:18,917
I'm astounded by her cynicaI
show of indifference.

1365
02:11:19,120 --> 02:11:21,680
If she'd Ioved her husband at aII,

1366
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:25,919
how couId she remain so stoic
in the same room

1367
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:29,908
as the woman he'd Ioved desperateIy
for so many years?

1368
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:34,509
But it was you
who invited RacheI.

1369
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:39,271
I wanted to see if she'd come.
And she did.

1370
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:44,316
I'm not her. I haven't forgotten
Robert. I forget no one.

1371
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:48,035
ShaII I teII you what she is?
A pig!

1372
02:11:57,960 --> 02:11:58,710
MoreI.

1373
02:12:08,240 --> 02:12:12,028
Do you know what I heard
about Mrs. de ForcheviIIe?

1374
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:16,395
She's Iike a rose
that's been pickIed.

1375
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:19,677
- It fits her.
- Champagne?

1376
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:25,352
We have the same idiom.

1377
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:28,152
You obviousIy don't Iike her,

1378
02:12:28,360 --> 02:12:31,796
but if I understand correctIy,
you're reIated.

1379
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:36,835
VagueIy... on my husband's side,
but very distantIy.

1380
02:12:38,440 --> 02:12:42,353
Strange, how our reIatives
are cIose or distant,

1381
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:45,154
depending on our interest in them.

1382
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:49,399
True, I feeI...
very cIose to Oriane de Guermantes.

1383
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:51,791
So eIegant, so refined.

1384
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:55,836
But when I see that pickIed rose

1385
02:12:56,040 --> 02:12:58,190
day and night with the Duke,

1386
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:00,960
I find it...

1387
02:13:05,600 --> 02:13:07,158
Odette de Crecy...

1388
02:13:08,080 --> 02:13:10,594
Odette de ForcheviIIe
with the Duke de Guermantes?

1389
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:14,998
What? You didn't know?
AII of Paris does!

1390
02:13:15,560 --> 02:13:19,792
The Duke even had to resign
from the Jockey CIub!

1391
02:13:19,960 --> 02:13:23,236
He's Iost his mind.
He's seniIe!

1392
02:13:23,560 --> 02:13:27,838
They say he tyrannizes her.
If he couId,

1393
02:13:28,480 --> 02:13:31,278
he'd make her his captive.

1394
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:32,748
And the Duchess?

1395
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:39,035
The Duchess, my friend Oriane,
is above reproach.

1396
02:13:39,480 --> 02:13:42,756
She suffers, of course.
Suffers in siIence.

1397
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:48,230
And aII the more because
peopIe say she has affairs!

1398
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:57,271
My friend! How are you?

1399
02:13:58,200 --> 02:14:02,637
On the score, it said:
AIIegro ma non troppo.

1400
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:10,309
FIuid...

1401
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:13,037
TaIk about fIuidity!

1402
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,468
I must see you.
It's important.

1403
02:14:21,680 --> 02:14:23,671
Of course...

1404
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:27,474
We'II group up!

1405
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,911
I said we'II group up!

1406
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:31,599
Did you see the musician?

1407
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:36,271
Such youth! So interesting!
Do you know her?

1408
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:38,598
Here she is!

1409
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:40,916
You were wonderfuI!

1410
02:14:44,240 --> 02:14:45,434
I Iistened...

1411
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:48,989
Excuse me.

1412
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:24,233
My dear, I'm sorry.
My mind was...

1413
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:27,514
AII these peopIe,
these new faces...

1414
02:15:27,880 --> 02:15:30,474
One feeIs a bit Iost.
Like in the fog.

1415
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:35,359
I hear you've been iII.
You do Iook a bit paIe.

1416
02:15:35,800 --> 02:15:40,032
Go back to BaIbec. It's so bracing.
Have you seen my GiIberte?

1417
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:42,871
I do Iove my daughter.

1418
02:15:43,320 --> 02:15:45,197
Without her I'd be Iost.

1419
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:49,917
Why are you staring?
Have I changed that much?

1420
02:15:50,920 --> 02:15:53,480
If I scuIpted,
you'd be my modeI.

1421
02:15:54,920 --> 02:15:58,390
How charming.
You wouIdn't have me pose naked?

1422
02:15:58,640 --> 02:16:01,837
You'd be perfect.
An aIIegory of eternaI youth.

1423
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:06,000
ReaIIy?
Are you being sincere?

1424
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:25,072
Come... Come home with me.
This chitter-chatter bores me.

1425
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:29,069
I enjoy it.
You have no party sense, my dear.

1426
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:33,070
From time to time,
it's nice to have fun and forget.

1427
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:35,950
I want to be aIone with you.

1428
02:16:36,440 --> 02:16:38,396
Come. Don't be chiIdish.

1429
02:16:38,880 --> 02:16:41,314
Sorry. I have better pIans.

1430
02:16:49,720 --> 02:16:51,073
Now that I've got you...

1431
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:55,595
Come to one of
my IittIe get-togethers.

1432
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:58,598
Kindred spirits.

1433
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:01,394
I saw you speaking with Aunt Oriane.

1434
02:17:02,120 --> 02:17:05,795
WonderfuI as she may be,
she's no inteIIectuaI.

1435
02:17:09,360 --> 02:17:12,397
Did you know that
Count de Courvoisier

1436
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:16,509
thought he was the onIy boy
to be attracted to another?

1437
02:17:17,240 --> 02:17:19,800
He thought the deviI made him so.

1438
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,639
I have no idea about such matters.

1439
02:17:22,920 --> 02:17:25,275
If you're Iooking for information,

1440
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:27,870
you shouId Iook eIsewhere.

1441
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:31,872
I'm a soIdier.
No Iess, no more.

1442
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:36,478
You used to be interested
in battIes.

1443
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:38,429
Remember?

1444
02:17:39,520 --> 02:17:43,672
You knew aII about
the encircIing of UIm in 1805...

1445
02:17:45,560 --> 02:17:48,632
by the BuIgarian wheeIing fIank.

1446
02:17:50,840 --> 02:17:52,159
My kind of subject.

1447
02:17:52,360 --> 02:17:56,592
As for what you were referring to,
it's Sanskrit to me.

1448
02:18:01,240 --> 02:18:02,468
Listen to me.

1449
02:18:05,920 --> 02:18:08,832
RacheI is reciting AIbert de Musset.

1450
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:10,996
Come, it's deIicious.

1451
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:14,670
We must taIk.
It's important.

1452
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:19,194
If she's not dead,
why don't they ever come out?

1453
02:18:19,400 --> 02:18:23,757
Because they're oId.
At their age, one stays at home.

1454
02:18:23,960 --> 02:18:27,635
The Countess d'Arpajon
died after a Iong iIIness.

1455
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:32,630
The Marquise died aII of a sudden,
of a minor aiIment.

1456
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:37,711
Who is this young woman
approaching us so gracefuIIy?

1457
02:18:38,360 --> 02:18:40,112
Are you joking?

1458
02:18:40,320 --> 02:18:42,117
Robert de St-Loup's daughter.

1459
02:18:42,320 --> 02:18:44,754
She Iooks Iike a Guermantes.

1460
02:18:44,960 --> 02:18:49,431
AIas, she takes after her mother
and her grandmother.

1461
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:51,676
They're working on

1462
02:18:51,880 --> 02:18:56,237
a good marriage
to cement their sociaI standing.

1463
02:19:20,280 --> 02:19:22,157
I have to keep him to heeI.

1464
02:19:23,160 --> 02:19:25,993
Or eIse he'd Iock me up.
What a tyrant!

1465
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:31,909
I'm aIIowed some parties,
daytime onIy, no baIIs.

1466
02:19:32,120 --> 02:19:34,236
I think he's going mad.

1467
02:19:34,440 --> 02:19:38,353
It runs in the famiIy. The thought
of his brother scares me.

1468
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:42,435
I don't Iike to be cramped.

1469
02:19:42,640 --> 02:19:44,710
That's it.
I adore my freedom.

1470
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:48,310
The great Ioves of my Iife
were aII terribIy jeaIous.

1471
02:19:48,520 --> 02:19:51,398
As a writer,
you understand such behavior.

1472
02:19:51,600 --> 02:19:55,275
De ForcheviIIe was mediocre.
I require inteIIigence.

1473
02:19:55,480 --> 02:19:59,473
But Mr. Swann was...
so profound, so attractive.

1474
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:05,071
Mr. de Breaute. Two wiId years.
HannibaI. We caIIed him BabaI.

1475
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:06,713
Did you know him?

1476
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:11,275
- Another tyrant.
- RacheI's about to recite Musset.

1477
02:20:12,240 --> 02:20:15,152
Your uncIe is busy.
Come back Iater.

1478
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:16,875
Come in...

1479
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:28,389
My nephew.

1480
02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:33,069
My humbIe respects.

1481
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:36,068
HumbIe respects?
How charming.

1482
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:38,791
He Iooks Iike his mother.

1483
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:41,151
You've onIy seen her photo.

1484
02:20:41,360 --> 02:20:42,952
I beg your pardon.

1485
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:46,398
I saw her on the stairs
when you were iII.

1486
02:20:46,640 --> 02:20:48,596
Just for a second, but...

1487
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:51,678
It was dark
but I was abIe to admire her.

1488
02:20:52,280 --> 02:20:55,431
This young man has her pretty eyes.
And that.

1489
02:20:56,600 --> 02:20:58,511
He Iooks most Iike his father.

1490
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:01,918
He has my poor mother's chin.

1491
02:21:04,120 --> 02:21:05,599
Some Turkish deIight?

1492
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:10,437
These come from IstanbuI.
I share them with aII my friends.

1493
02:21:10,640 --> 02:21:14,189
There's mint, rose,
cedar, and pistachio.

1494
02:21:17,880 --> 02:21:19,757
They stick to your teeth.

1495
02:21:20,400 --> 02:21:22,311
Don't be a kiIIjoy.

1496
02:21:22,840 --> 02:21:24,956
I'm thriIIed to meet your nephew.

1497
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:28,351
I once met your father.

1498
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:31,553
He was so good to me, so sweet.

1499
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:36,355
You shouId get back to work.

1500
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:46,673
I've grown used to the ones
the Grand Duke sends me.

1501
02:21:49,480 --> 02:21:51,596
I toId him you were jeaIous.

1502
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,878
Take another Turkish deIight,
if you want.

1503
02:21:59,240 --> 02:22:00,593
Then get going.

1504
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:04,078
His parents supervise his studies.

1505
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:07,593
He may be the next Victor Hugo.

1506
02:22:08,040 --> 02:22:10,838
I adore artists.
They aIone understand women.

1507
02:22:11,480 --> 02:22:13,869
Artists and men of exception,
Iike you.

1508
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:18,036
This time, you say goodbye
and you Ieave.

1509
02:22:22,600 --> 02:22:24,397
AIready gaIIant. See that?

1510
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:28,868
He has an eye for women.
He gets that from you.

1511
02:22:29,800 --> 02:22:33,509
Once you Iearn not to bIush,
you'II be a perfect gentIeman.

1512
02:22:34,280 --> 02:22:37,078
If you ever want to stop by for tea,

1513
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:40,397
a cup of tea,
as our EngIish friends say, do.

1514
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:43,074
- Just send me a wire.
- A wire?

1515
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:44,999
A teIegram.

1516
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:47,035
Get going.

1517
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:00,834
You have an EngIish accent.

1518
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:02,553
I'm American.

1519
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:12,918
What wiII you pIay?

1520
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:15,515
Beethoven.

1521
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:41,188
A sitting room for cIose friends.

1522
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:44,677
I'II give you this key.

1523
02:24:45,480 --> 02:24:47,471
Give it back Iater.

1524
02:26:18,280 --> 02:26:20,191
Mr. Swann has Ieft.

1525
02:26:20,640 --> 02:26:23,200
Now Mama can come
and say goodnight.

1526
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:27,189
Do you know this?
It's Victor Hugo.

1527
02:26:29,440 --> 02:26:32,273
Grass must grow
and chiIdren must die.

1528
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:33,799
You read Hugo?

1529
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,992
You read Francois Ie Champi.
At your age!

1530
02:26:37,320 --> 02:26:39,709
I've aIready died severaI times.

1531
02:26:40,760 --> 02:26:44,594
I Ioved AIbertine above aII,
then stopped Ioving her.

1532
02:26:44,960 --> 02:26:48,111
GiIberte too.
I haven't Ioved her for ages.

1533
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:51,110
Each time I became someone eIse.

1534
02:26:51,320 --> 02:26:54,551
You sIowIy grow
indifferent to death.

1535
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:56,591
Reassuring yourseIf?

1536
02:26:57,600 --> 02:27:00,797
I'm not scared for myseIf,
but for my book.

1537
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:02,953
I stiII need some time.

1538
02:27:03,160 --> 02:27:04,718
WiII you Iet me read it?

1539
02:27:05,640 --> 02:27:06,789
It's Mama.

1540
02:29:09,080 --> 02:29:10,752
CIose your eyes now.

1541
02:29:38,400 --> 02:29:39,799
What wouId you Iike?

1542
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:41,513
Some champagne.

1543
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:44,909
But I have a favor to ask you.

1544
02:29:49,920 --> 02:29:53,913
That girI taIking to her friend...
Her Iaugh is vuIgar.

1545
02:29:55,400 --> 02:29:58,995
But her siIk bIouse is exquisite.

1546
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,912
- A gift, I suppose.
- I don't know.

1547
02:30:03,160 --> 02:30:05,549
I'm interested in the cuffs.

1548
02:30:06,720 --> 02:30:08,995
See how prettiIy they're foIded up?

1549
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:14,113
I'd Iike to know more
about the embroidery.

1550
02:30:14,800 --> 02:30:16,392
Try to get detaiIs.

1551
02:30:16,840 --> 02:30:19,673
Is it a bIanket stitch?
Openwork?

1552
02:30:21,720 --> 02:30:23,312
Try your best, my friend.

1553
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:32,514
The day the sculptor Salvini died,

1554
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,753
he was given,
as all mortals are,

1555
02:30:36,280 --> 02:30:40,068
the time to review
every place and moment of his life.

1556
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:43,076
The sculptor refused.

1557
02:30:43,880 --> 02:30:47,839
My life has been a series
of extraordinary adventures.

1558
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:51,919
To revisit them
would only make me sadder.

1559
02:30:52,560 --> 02:30:55,120
l'd rather use my remaining time

1560
02:30:55,720 --> 02:30:58,951
to review my last work,
Divine Nemesis,

1561
02:30:59,200 --> 02:31:02,431
otherwise known
as The Triumph of Death.

1562
02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:04,393
So it was.

1563
02:31:05,720 --> 02:31:08,393
Soon after,
the AAngel of Death returned

1564
02:31:08,600 --> 02:31:11,433
to announce the end
of his time of grace.

1565
02:31:12,880 --> 02:31:15,872
What a paradox! exclaimed Salvini.

1566
02:31:16,920 --> 02:31:20,595
You gave me enough time
to revisit my whole life,

1567
02:31:20,800 --> 02:31:22,438
which lasted sixty-three years.

1568
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:24,232
The same length of time

1569
02:31:24,440 --> 02:31:27,989
was too short to review
an object l made in 3 months.

1570
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,514
ln this work is all of your life

1571
02:31:32,880 --> 02:31:35,872
and the life of all men,
the AAngel replied.

1572
02:31:36,600 --> 02:31:40,354
To review it
would take an eternity...
