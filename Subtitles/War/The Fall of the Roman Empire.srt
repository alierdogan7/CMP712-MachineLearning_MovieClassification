1
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,867
Two of the greatest problems in history

2
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,737
Are how to account for the rise of Rome

3
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,869
And how to account for her fall.

4
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,572
We may come nearly to understanding
of the truth,

5
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,547
But if we remember that the fall of Rome

6
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,015
like her rise,

7
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:11,019
Had not one cause but many.

8
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,521
And it was not an event,

9
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:17,014
But a process spread over 300 years.

10
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,027
Some nations have not lasted that long

11
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,097
As Rome fell.

12
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,724
In the year 180 A.D.,

13
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,734
The Emperor Marcus Aurelius,

14
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,770
Who led his Roman legions

15
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:35,437
Against the Germaenic tribes along
the Danium frontier.

16
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,176
My lord, Caesar. The omens are bad.

17
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:48,383
I could not find its heart.

18
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,358
When I was a child Themonitus,

19
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,591
I has a secret fear
that night would come

20
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,793
And would never end.

21
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:02,031
That we would live out our lives
in total darkness,

22
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,972
But it was a small fear then.

23
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,167
Yet my lord, Caesar.

24
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,676
The sun always rises,

25
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,211
And will again.

26
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,975
So you say.

27
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,210
It is said more people died this moment

28
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,516
When night is about to give way to day
than in any other time.

29
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,751
It seems to me night whispers:
Come away with me

30
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,759
To the west, and sleep forever.

31
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:28,491
What is another day to offer you?

32
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:32,432
What is another day to offer you,
Themonitus?

33
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,527
Warmth...

34
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,368
Life...

35
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,534
Color...

36
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,770
People.

37
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,649
My lord, Caesar,

38
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,811
The sun.

39
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,583
As you predicted.

40
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:03,690
I congratulate you, Themonitus

41
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,620
Themonitus. Levius,

42
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:06,230
Levius.

43
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,798
How is Caesar?

44
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,957
Well, in order to answer that question

45
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,297
One must consider three aspects of
the situation

46
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:16,862
One, our emperor has been
at the war for 17 years

47
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,135
And lived under
very difficult conditions.

48
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,768
Two, no one could ever describe
Marcus Aurelius

49
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,175
As a robust man.

50
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:26,341
There's a joke among the soldiers here
about Themonitus.

51
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,577
They say ask Themonitus what day is it,

52
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:35,250
And he will lecture you
on the history of the calendar.

53
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,963
You are well my lord, Caesar.

54
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,932
It seems that every governor, every king

55
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,663
In the whole empire
is waiting in the valley below.

56
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,672
I invited them here
for a particular purpose.

57
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,903
I've also asked my son, Comadeus.

58
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,808
Your great friend, Comadeus.

59
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,380
Tell me of your last campaign

60
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,608
In this barbarian forest.

61
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:00,843
Two or three times,

62
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,645
We thought we had Balimar, their leader,

63
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,380
But each time he was able to get away.

64
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,320
A few days longer, Caesar.

65
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,585
We'll bring you his head.

66
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,319
No, Levius.
Please don't bring me his head.

67
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,122
I wouldn't know what to do with it.

68
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,822
Bring him to me alive.

69
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,730
But he is the heart of the barbarians...

70
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,995
Then bring me
the heart of the barbarians.

71
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,832
I wish to speak with him

72
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,268
Speak with him?

73
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,807
Rome has existed for a thousand years,

74
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,775
It is time we find peaceful ways
to live with those

75
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,777
You called barbarians,

76
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:36,410
So bring me this Balimar
alive and quickly.

77
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,991
There was a rumor that Lucila was here.

78
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,434
Lucila, Caesar's daughter.

79
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:59,634
Ah yes, Caesar's daughter.

80
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,826
As the dog fears the eagle,

81
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,821
As the lamb fears the wolf,

82
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:29,531
So is my heart heavy with fear.

83
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:34,770
Oh, mother Vesta,
eternal mother of Rome.

84
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,471
Help me.

85
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:40,471
Bring back the health of my father.

86
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:48,149
Protect us from the danger
which hangs over the empire.

87
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:54,488
Let there be peace over all Rome.

88
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,902
Lucila.

89
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,066
Levius.

90
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:16,043
Lucila,

91
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,417
You are beautiful.

92
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,490
You are beautiful...

93
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:25,653
What does that mean?

94
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,528
It has been so long.

95
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,068
I have forgotten.

96
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:36,196
Why didn't you ever try to see me
when you are in Rome?

97
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,072
It seemed you didn't want to see anyone.

98
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:44,773
I thought by living alone away
from the world,

99
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,714
I could find peace.

100
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,876
Then I found there is no real peace

101
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,353
In being alone.

102
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:56,380
There is only loneliness.

103
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,657
I too had been lonely, Lucila.

104
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,130
I'm here now, Levius.

105
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,760
And if my father's health improves,

106
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:12,434
And if your duties
as a soldier do not prevent it,

107
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,640
We may see each other,

108
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,772
If you want to.

109
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,943
I want to.

110
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,157
Kitritdarte, king of Petra.

111
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:41,322
Welcome Kitritdarte. Welcome Petra.

112
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,476
Costabokus, king of the Omnia.

113
00:11:55,681 --> 00:12:01,574
Greetings Costabokus, king of the Omnia.

114
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:16,257
Severius, proconsul of Judea.

115
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,536
Africa.

116
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:39,716
Welcome... Perjileana,
proconsul of Syria.

117
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,484
Marcelus, governor of Egypt I think.

118
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:48,656
Marcelus, friend of Caesar.

119
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:01,501
And who would this be, Themonitus?

120
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,103
Perjileana, proconsul of Syria.

121
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,682
My greatful thanks Themonitus.

122
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:12,847
Perjileana, friend of Caesar.

123
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,727
Welcome.

124
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,239
Pericleas, proconsul of Athens.

125
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:35,402
Pericleas of Athens.

126
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,658
Rome is honored, Sir Hamas

127
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,594
That Armenian's king is with us.

128
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,290
My lord, Caesar

129
00:13:56,468 --> 00:14:01,861
Armenia hopes for
even closer ties to Rome.

130
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:37,731
Perthinas, Britania

131
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:40,676
Welcome Perthinas.

132
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,839
Welcome Britania.

133
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,208
Hail Caesar!

134
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:23,809
Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!

135
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:29,984
Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!

136
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,860
Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!

137
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:42,029
Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!

138
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,411
Governors, consuls,

139
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,181
Princes...

140
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,881
You have come from the deserts of Egypt,

141
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,721
From the mountains of Armenia,

142
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,362
From the forest of Goule

143
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,556
And the prairies of Spain.

144
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,428
You do not resemble each other,

145
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,434
Nor do you wear the same clothes,

146
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,335
Nor sing the same songs,

147
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,466
Nor worship the same gods.

148
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:22,067
Yet like a mighty tree

149
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:26,809
With green leaves and black roots,

150
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,877
You are the unity which is Rome.

151
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:36,619
Look about you and look at yourselves,

152
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:42,790
And see the greatness of Rome.

153
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:47,329
Two hundred years ago
the Goules were our fiercest enemies.

154
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,428
Now we greet them as friends.

155
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,303
In the whole world,

156
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:57,244
Only two small frontiers
are still hostile to us.

157
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,043
One here in the north which separates us

158
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,847
From those who are called barbarians,

159
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,616
The other in the east Persia.

160
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:11,387
Only on these two borders will you find

161
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,986
Walls, palisades,

162
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,724
Forts and hatred.

163
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:22,328
But these are not
the frontiers Rome wants.

164
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:28,502
Rome wants and needs human frontiers.

165
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,171
We had to fight long wars.

166
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,876
Your burdens had been great.

167
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,851
But we come now to the

168
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,354
End of the road.

169
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,616
Here!

170
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:45,820
Within our reach
golden century of peace.

171
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:49,523
A true Pax Romana.

172
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,168
Wherever you live,

173
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,861
Whatever the color of your skin.

174
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,927
When peace is achieved,

175
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,733
It will bring to all,

176
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,672
All!

177
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:05,771
The supreme rights of Roman citizenship.

178
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,818
My lord, Caesar. Are you ill?

179
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:19,157
A small pain in my side. It will pass.

180
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,060
No longer provinces, all colonies

181
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,461
But Rome,

182
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,534
Rome everywhere.

183
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:29,366
A family of equal nations.

184
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:34,535
That is what lies ahead.

185
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:51,351
May God hastens the day.

186
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,251
Lucila,

187
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,512
Each time I see you

188
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:51,950
I wondered how it is possible,

189
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:56,423
I fathered something so beautiful.

190
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,927
You make it hard for me
to take leave of this life.

191
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,463
Father,

192
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,498
You have a long life ahead of you.

193
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,432
Death is in the order of things.

194
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,765
Didn't they teach you that in school?

195
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,635
I will not let you leave me.

196
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,400
Is there a choice?

197
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,305
Soon this trickle of blood,

198
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,568
This few bones,

199
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:22,379
This net woven with nerves
and arteries will be dust.

200
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:25,421
No choice.

201
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,616
Now that I'm here.

202
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:33,252
I will see that
You take better care of yourself.

203
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,423
Even so,

204
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,093
Time is short.

205
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:44,936
And there is a decision
which I can no longer delay.

206
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:49,341
I have sacrificed the love of my son.

207
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,972
Comadeus will never be my heir.

208
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,812
Levius,

209
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,877
My wish that you should succeed me.

210
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,980
And I intend to present you
to the leaders of the empire

211
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:06,016
Openly as my successor.

212
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:07,630
But,

213
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,462
You said yourself, Caesar.
It needs someone who will change,

214
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,501
Who will find your ways.

215
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,230
A man of the tenth century of Rome.

216
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,864
I know only the ways of war.

217
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:21,739
I would not know how to make allies
out of the barbarians.

218
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,539
You will find your ways.

219
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,343
I have a heart for you, Levius.

220
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,042
But Comadeus already
shares the throne with you.

221
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,654
I have hope that the position and

222
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:33,780
Responsibilities would make him grow up

223
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:38,088
But he is interested only
in games and gladiators.

224
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:41,460
It was you Caesar
who brought me into your family.

225
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,659
Comadeus and I are like brother.

226
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,600
I love Comadeus, too.

227
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,832
But that's just a feeling.

228
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,273
A personal feeling.

229
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:57,437
My lord, Caesar.
Price Comadeus sent you his greetings.

230
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,207
He is in the snow country,

231
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,979
Two days journey from here.

232
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,348
Perhaps, I should meet Comadeus

233
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:07,889
My lord, Caesar.
Yes, Levius. Go and meet him.

234
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:15,556
And think about what I said
but remember my time is short.

235
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:59,802
Even though Comadeus is my brother,

236
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:05,005
I would have done as you did, father.

237
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,606
And would you also have chosen Levius?

238
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,777
Yes!

239
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,948
Yes.

240
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,521
Only...

241
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,152
Why did he hesitate?

242
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,856
If it not been the kind of man
who hesitate when face

243
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:29,166
With such a great responsibility
I would not have chosen him.

244
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:33,333
Come, sit by me.

245
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:39,372
Let me look at you.

246
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:45,112
Are you happy?

247
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:49,019
You seem reasonably happy, and yet...

248
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:52,856
And yet, father.

249
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,827
A disturbing whisper reached me

250
00:23:55,033 --> 00:24:02,394
That you thought once of retiring to
the temple of Vesta.

251
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,341
I know it is too simple to think of life

252
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:12,472
As I the beautiful or ugly.

253
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,640
There was a time

254
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,481
When life seemed very ugly to me.

255
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,645
Is it because of your mother?

256
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,917
I was ashamed.

257
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,857
She brought you such pain.

258
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,554
I knew moments of happiness with her,

259
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,393
And beauty.

260
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,490
But she looked for lovers elsewhere,

261
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,831
Since she could not love me.

262
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,373
You're the best. The greatest of men.

263
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:41,102
Is that the way it must be, father?

264
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,235
Only moments of beauty

265
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:45,712
And then betrayal.

266
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:50,377
We must try to
understand other people more.

267
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:56,214
Understand cruelty and weakness.

268
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,817
Even that.

269
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,761
You have such a gift for life, Lucila,

270
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:08,929
But I think you ask too much of it.

271
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:15,735
Learn pity.

272
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,173
Learn to have compassion.

273
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,614
To yourself, too.

274
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,553
Pity and compassion to yourself.

275
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:29,750
The future will make
great demands on you.

276
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,919
Oh, father.

277
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:43,496
Levius!

278
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:51,071
Levius!

279
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:55,041
Levius!

280
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,982
Comadeus!

281
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,679
Comadeus!

282
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,780
Levius!

283
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:23,335
Galius Levius, warrior, voyager.

284
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:25,175
Comadeus, Comadeus.

285
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,305
Most strongest of them all.

286
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,451
I miss you!

287
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:29,449
Are you well?

288
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:31,849
I never am well!

289
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,490
I have much to tell you.

290
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:34,818
And I you!

291
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,550
We both come up from Rome.

292
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,455
To the honors,

293
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:41,621
Matches, glorious.

294
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:57,631
Father.

295
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,707
I've seen too little of you.

296
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:01,708
That was not my wish.

297
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,210
Nor mine.

298
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,940
But this wars have been endless.

299
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:07,584
Endless because,

300
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,913
You were too gentle.

301
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,248
I would have fought
these wars differently.

302
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,551
There's a lot we do
differently Comadeus.

303
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,456
I wish you could have
come to Rome more often.

304
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,654
As a new generation,
there's a whole new feeling.

305
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:23,459
You mean I'm getting old,
senile perhaps.

306
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,226
Rome has changed since you were there.

307
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,632
Rome has changed.

308
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,763
It is now crawling with gladiators.

309
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,237
Sister,

310
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,435
I thought you retired as a Vesta virgin.

311
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:37,809
And abandon Rome
to you and your athlete.

312
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,177
Female philosopher.

313
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,615
As I remembered, you two
began to quarrel as soon as

314
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,777
You could walk. I expect you're tired.

315
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,320
And thirsty.

316
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:51,484
We'll talk together soon.

317
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,226
Come let us find someone...

318
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,426
Vitorious Poliminus and Victorinus,

319
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:02,401
We have fought four campaigns together.

320
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:05,872
Felibus, the greatest
gladiator of all Rome,

321
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,238
Survivor of a hundred combats.

322
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,811
We've come to fight your battles.

323
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:11,845
Gladiators to fight us soldiers...

324
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:12,846
Why not?

325
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:19,012
We'll teach your legions how to kill.

326
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:25,452
Have some wine.

327
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,457
Marcus Aurelius, our Caesar

328
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,161
Does not look well.

329
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,138
Dying man never do.

330
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,267
But you knew Caesar was dying
where else could have

331
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:46,075
Pulled you and your kind away
from the city of Rome.

332
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,376
You know, Levius.

333
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:48,415
It's when I'm with you,

334
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,918
I feel... good.

335
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,386
Safe.

336
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:55,855
Don't ever change.

337
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,358
Caesar was just telling me
I should change.

338
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:01,157
Oh father thinks too much.

339
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,699
As much for a Roman
to think of these days.

340
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,734
Why Levius,

341
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,031
For a moment that honest warrior's face

342
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,371
Of yours took on a philosopher's role

343
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:20,540
Let's not think, let's drink.

344
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,416
As in the old days?

345
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:32,585
As in the old days.

346
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,850
Did you study logic?

347
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:35,048
Do you know what a dilemma is?

348
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:39,619
A dilemma.

349
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,226
Is...

350
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:48,861
When we have two possibilities
and both of them are impossible.

351
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:53,032
That is the norm

352
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,013
Drink with me.

353
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,121
Now drink with me.

354
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,282
Drink with me!

355
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,093
I'm Caesar's son,

356
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:20,260
I can have you burned alive!

357
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,965
Why Levius.

358
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:31,770
My friend.

359
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,907
My brother.

360
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:43,082
Something is struggling you, isn't it?

361
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,788
Your father,

362
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:52,658
Have asked me...

363
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,829
To be his heir.

364
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:19,752
My own father.

365
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:24,257
But I'm his son.

366
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:30,662
He must hate me very much.

367
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:34,834
He does not hate you.

368
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,207
I did not ask for this, Comadeus.

369
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,212
Nor did you refuse.

370
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:40,850
Ask me to refuse!

371
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,976
Ask you?

372
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,622
If you listen carefully.

373
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,783
You will hear the gods...

374
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:55,989
You will hear the gods laughing.

375
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,724
I do not hear them laughing.

376
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:03,828
You will do what the gods decide!

377
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:32,658
She is for you.

378
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:36,396
She thinks.

379
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,058
Levius.

380
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,258
Levius.

381
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:19,872
Lucila.

382
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,577
Lucila!

383
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:04,418
Have you finished
with Comadeus and wine?

384
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:08,360
My world has suddenly become strange.

385
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:11,592
I'm not sure where I am.

386
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:15,363
I'm sure of only one thing.

387
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:18,497
I love you, Lucila.

388
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,939
If you are so sure,

389
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:24,000
Why did it take you so long?

390
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:27,981
I think I must have known
all these years.

391
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:32,907
I must have been certain
that one day this will happen.

392
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:37,083
No, we have not known.

393
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,991
No and not know.

394
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:45,158
How can that be?

395
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:53,168
I'm not sure how it was.

396
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:56,107
But I know now.

397
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,838
You were always with me.

398
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,108
Everywhere.

399
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,516
I took you in the battle with me.

400
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:09,682
You were with me in the gold fields.

401
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,155
But you know this.

402
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:13,921
Only this.

403
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,962
I know this.

404
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,691
You were with me, too.

405
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,767
Always!

406
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:24,203
There were times when I wanted to
run away from life,

407
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:29,198
I did not because I told myself that

408
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,005
One day

409
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,376
You will be with me.

410
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:38,840
I want to be with you
for the rest of my life.

411
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:42,014
I love you.

412
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:47,853
Do you, Levius?

413
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:02,168
Bring him back to me safely.

414
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:05,406
Bring him back to me quickly.

415
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:10,576
Make him love me forever.

416
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,148
Get these men back behind the lines.

417
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,090
We're setting a trap for Balimar.

418
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:00,627
I will lead the attack.

419
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,264
The men we sent first at the battle

420
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,229
Will be used as bait.

421
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:07,199
Many will die.

422
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,635
It will be specially
dangerous for their leader.

423
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,330
We will be the first into this battle.

424
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,739
We will be your bait.

425
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:17,038
And if I die,
then the gods are not with me.

426
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,944
Then Levius, my friend,

427
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,743
My brother.

428
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:28,380
Will it not relieve you
of a great burden?

429
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:35,224
As a command
you will lead your men forward.

430
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:37,594
You will move deeper
and deeper into that forest

431
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,724
Until the barbarians are convinced

432
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,063
That it is safe to attack.

433
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,762
You will stand and hold until

434
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,737
We move in and close the trap.

435
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:49,902
We will stand and hold.

436
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,354
Balimar!

437
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:07,541
Balimar has escaped

438
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:15,207
Because some of your gladiators
we cowards.

439
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:18,349
Father...

440
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:21,513
Father.

441
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:31,387
It has been decided, Lucila.

442
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:36,857
Armenian throne would become even closer

443
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:39,372
A part of Rome,

444
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:41,305
A lovely part,

445
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:45,470
Will become Armenia.

446
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:08,765
Lucila,

447
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:11,270
I want you to take care of these.

448
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:16,208
I wrote them while campaigning
in these forests.

449
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:21,441
I will watch over them, father.

450
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:23,607
I have tried to convince myself,

451
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:28,109
But my fears for
the empire are unreasonable.

452
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:30,418
But my fears are reasonable.

453
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:33,960
The east, Lucila
is where the danger lies.

454
00:50:34,164 --> 00:50:37,622
We must make an alliance
that will show the whole world

455
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:42,999
What value Rome places on
her eastern frontier.

456
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:48,200
An alliance with Armenia.

457
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,275
And so...

458
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:55,747
Caesar must give his daughter
in marriage

459
00:50:55,952 --> 00:51:00,844
To the king of Armenia.

460
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:06,023
I had hopes that the gods would be kind.

461
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:13,692
I had hope that you would not
have a marriage without love.

462
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:17,962
Father...

463
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,598
You know better than anyone

464
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:24,110
What a marriage without love can mean.

465
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:27,272
Yes.

466
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:31,309
Yes. I do.

467
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:36,817
I know you love me.

468
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,985
Therefore...

469
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:43,660
Therefore, if you asked me,

470
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:49,555
It can only mean that you must
have tried with all your strength

471
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,866
To find another way.

472
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:55,033
Yes, I have.

473
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:03,440
And you could not.

474
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:06,284
No...

475
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:09,448
I could not.

476
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:16,955
Therefore, it must be time.

477
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:58,437
Does...

478
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:03,534
Does Rome punish cowards?

479
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:34,409
Stop this!

480
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:38,069
Stop this! Stop this!

481
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:40,169
You cruelest cowards!

482
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,079
Let 20 of your men fight 20 of ours.

483
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:46,119
If they dare unless you are cowards.

484
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,086
Move out of the way!

485
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:49,451
No one touches, Berilus!

486
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:53,925
I am the commander of the northern army.

487
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,826
Continue the punishment.

488
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:58,159
I will not permit this!

489
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:00,324
Withdraw, Comadeus!

490
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:01,492
I cannot.

491
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:04,128
Nor can I.

492
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:06,366
Then let the gods decide.

493
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:30,275
Yes, the omens had been bad.

494
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,742
Bad for whom?

495
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,279
For us, for Rome.

496
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:35,075
At least here we can speak clearly.

497
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,082
What would you like, Julianas,

498
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,653
That the gods sent us written messages

499
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:43,019
Advising us on each small move we make.

500
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:44,784
Is the murder of an emperor

501
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:47,952
A small move?

502
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:50,161
Richard.

503
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:52,664
Caesar is dying and he knows it.

504
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:55,292
At any moment, he will disinherit
Comadeus and proclaim

505
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:56,938
Levius his heir.

506
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,300
Once he does that publicly.

507
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:01,534
What hope is there for us?

508
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:05,703
To kill Caesar.

509
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:07,380
Does Comadeus know?

510
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,609
No.

511
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:13,175
He must never know.

512
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:15,516
Caesar's gone.

513
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:17,522
There are so many close to him.

514
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,716
How could it be done?

515
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,361
Quite easily.

516
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:24,124
We always know that Caesar loves fruit.

517
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:27,292
Apple.

518
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:33,404
Now this blade carries a deadly poison.

519
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,568
On the side with the carved snake.

520
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:39,942
Cut fruit with it, an apple.

521
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:42,276
Offer the poison half to Caesar,

522
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:43,782
Eat the other half for yourself,

523
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:49,550
Then long live the emperor, Comadeus.

524
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:51,954
It could be done
before hundreds of witnesses.

525
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:53,492
No one could be suspected.

526
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:57,052
From whom will Caesar accept fruit?

527
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,155
Who is close enough to him.

528
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,199
I am.

529
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:01,335
You!

530
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:04,496
You are blind.

531
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:18,277
I have only to feel the blade
and know its side.

532
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:24,449
And who better than a blind man.

533
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:45,737
Are you a man to enjoy
an irony Marcus Aurelius?

534
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:50,413
Look well then
at the emperor of all Rome

535
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:55,114
Become no better than a slave.

536
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:59,648
And who or what is your master.

537
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:01,921
Slave!

538
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:05,294
A small point in your side.

539
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:11,963
Perhaps not larger than
a grain of wheat.

540
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:15,969
Of what use is your wisdom now.

541
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:19,137
No answer.

542
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:26,743
Think of all you've read
and pondered over the years.

543
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,049
And the talk, Marcus Aurelius.

544
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:31,522
The hours of talk with your friend,

545
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:32,956
Themonitus.

546
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:36,290
Surely it must have prepared you
for this moment.

547
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:38,387
But it has failed you, hasn't it?

548
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:41,126
You are not prepared.

549
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:44,295
Why?

550
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,330
In all that talk did this
is this topic dead,

551
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:53,004
Slip your mind
or did you know deep down

552
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:58,304
That your wisdom would be helpless
before this mystery.

553
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:01,410
Of mysteries.

554
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:04,319
But once you have admit that

555
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:05,425
All other knowledge and skills

556
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:08,324
Become trivial and meaningless.

557
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:11,022
But then you will not help
thought and read

558
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,033
And talk and wonder.

559
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:17,798
So, perhaps it is just as well.

560
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,430
For if men do not think greed,

561
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:22,406
Talk to each other

562
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:25,274
Above all else, talk.

563
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:30,441
There are no longer men.

564
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:48,629
He has come for me.

565
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:51,398
The silent boat will ferry me across

566
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:54,667
The shadow of river.

567
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:59,871
I am not ready for you.

568
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:04,313
I've always been willing
to bargain with my enemies.

569
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,885
Can we not make a treaty.

570
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:09,013
For your part I asked you
to wait two years.

571
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,989
One year.

572
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:15,653
I cannot do it in less than a year.

573
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:19,790
I do not seek pleasure
or friendship or love.

574
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:22,061
I speak only of Rome.

575
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:26,298
And when I say Rome, I mean the world.

576
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:28,340
The future.

577
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:31,240
For my part
I am prepared to live on in pain.

578
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:35,872
A year. What is a year to you?

579
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:39,043
Stupid thing.

580
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:42,454
And it was I who said,

581
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:44,023
It is not in the nature

582
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:48,891
Of fig tree to be a fig as for
honey bees to give honey,

583
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:54,730
And for the lion who fall upon the land.

584
01:02:54,971 --> 01:03:00,500
So it is in the way of things
that you should come for me.

585
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,803
Forgive me, Berklin.

586
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:06,436
I did not realize you were blind
and deaf

587
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:09,914
Come for me when you will.

588
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:14,078
My hand shall lead us.

589
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:20,455
But I tell you this

590
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:27,125
That it is a great truth
that we have not yet divined.

591
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:35,367
Oh, it is you Cleanda.

592
01:03:35,578 --> 01:03:39,139
Is there something
I can do my lord Caesar?

593
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:42,306
I'm in pain.

594
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:51,549
The Greeks say there is nothing better
than fruit to soften pain.

595
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:58,189
Share this with me.

596
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,113
I have been engaged to king Hamus.

597
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:21,681
But you are mine.

598
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:25,650
My father gave his word.

599
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:27,686
Come away with me.

600
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:31,849
Where could we go?

601
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:34,426
Anywhere where we could be alone.

602
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,791
But there is no such a place.

603
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:38,762
I'm Caesar's daughter.

604
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:41,892
A woman...

605
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:47,298
That is much higher rank.

606
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,643
I couldn't live that way.

607
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:54,179
Nor could you.

608
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:56,908
I could.

609
01:05:57,153 --> 01:06:02,477
I have to choose between
being Caesar's heir or your love.

610
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:06,651
I choose your love.

611
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,756
I cannot.

612
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:20,598
How can you do anything else?

613
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:24,301
Only this is real.

614
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:26,401
All else is half-life.

615
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:30,574
A dream. Only this.

616
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:35,485
How can you ask me
to forget everything I am?

617
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:38,888
All that my life means.

618
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:43,361
How could your life
mean anything without love?

619
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:49,527
I will not let this happen.

620
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:24,233
Father,

621
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:28,399
Why did you deny me?

622
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:07,204
Caesar is dying!

623
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:39,870
Father.

624
01:10:16,912 --> 01:10:19,870
Levius.

625
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:14,356
You are looking for
a document Themonitus?

626
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:17,259
A document in which my father
named me his heir.

627
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:18,990
There is no such document.

628
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:22,159
There must be.

629
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:31,542
His last word was Levius.

630
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:33,442
I will bare witness.

631
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:36,072
And it was Caesar's wish

632
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:39,880
That you be his heir.
