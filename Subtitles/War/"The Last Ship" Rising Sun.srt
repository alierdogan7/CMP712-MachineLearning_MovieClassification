get the bird in the air

anywhere on their radar.

Mr. President, there's an
incoming call from Hong Kong.

It's President Peng.

President Peng.

550
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:53,704
Mr. President, I understand
it is very late there,

551
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:57,508
so I am sorry to add to
your troubles in Vietnam.

552
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,943
No. No.

553
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:00,277
Do you have some news for us?

554
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,513
I'm afraid I do.

555
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,548
It seems that Captain Chandler's plane

556
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,383
had some very serious engine trouble

557
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,519

off from our airport.

558
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,388
Unfortunately, the plane went down.

It is certainly suspicious,
Mr. President,

565
00:28:31,207 --> 00:28:33,241
with what happened in Vietnam.

566
00:28:33,242 --> 00:28:34,743

operating in the region.

in with engine trouble.
