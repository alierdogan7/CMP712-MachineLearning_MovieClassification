00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,310
WIRELESS: Mr Churchill, in his speech in
the House of Commons this afternoon, said,

2
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,432
''For now, nearly two years,
Malta has stood against the enemy.

3
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,471
What a thorn it has been in their side.

4
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,398
What a toll it has taken of their convoys.

5
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,277
For the last six weeks,

6
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,440
over 450 German first-line aircraft
and perhaps 200 Italian

7
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,313
have been venting their fury on Malta.''

8
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,475
Can't be far now.

9
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,317
No.

10
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,397
How long do we wait in Malta,
just a few minutes or till morning?

11
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,434
Depends what's happening when we get there.
I expect you'll refuel and go straight on.

12
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,277
Pity.

13
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,758
I want to get to Cairo as
quickly as possible,

14
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,359
but I would like to see
Malta in daylight.

15
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,318
I believe there are some very
interesting megalithic remains.

16
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,392
There are certainly some very interesting
remains on Malta, nowadays.

17
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,431
(Ackack gunfire)
- Megalithic and otherwise.

18
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,351
The runway looks clear.

19
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,392
If there's a doctor in the house,
will he please come to the stage door?

20
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,509
- OK. That's us.
- Home, James.

21
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,398
You chaps don't like being driven by
someone else, do you?

22
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,510
Not onto an airfield in
the middle of a raid.

23
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,515
- You been stationed here long?
- Since it started.

24
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,395
Anti-aircraft?

25
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,271
Security.

26
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,470
- Watch out. Big crater, 100 yards
on the left. - OK.

27
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,475
(Tyres squeal on runway)

28
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,351
Right. Right.

29
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,317
Crater dead ahead!

30
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,476
Well, we're down in one piece, anyway.

31
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,351
- Get 'em out. Quick.
- Right.

32
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,312
Right. Everyone out, please,
quick as you can.

33
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,435
(Distant explosions)

34
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,277
Come on.

35
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,515
(Bomb explodes)

36
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,316
- Is it always like this?
- Usually.

37
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,515
Colourful, isn't it?

38
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,395
(Hum of enemy aircraft)

39
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,476
I think I can manage without
seeing it in daylight.

40
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,476
They'll refuel when they
can and get you off.

41
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,395
(Bombs whistle)

42
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,395
Sorry.

43
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,317
Cancel my last remark.

44
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,431
That's our bomber squadron.

45
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,476
Hello, Red Gauntlet. This is Lucky.

46
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,513
Angels 2-0, Angels 2-0, report damage. Over.

47
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,392
Epsom 2-1 to Lucky. OK. Bandits destroyed.

48
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,435
Out.

49
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,392
Steady! You mustn't just
knock them down like that.

50
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,479
Most improbable. You must search
and find them and then knock them off.

51
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,431
Sorry, old boy.

52
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,314
This phantom squadron of yours
seems to be doing a great execution, Ramsey.

53
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,476
Thank you, sir.
Two Jerries just knocked each other down.

54
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,432
What'd happen to them
if we were really up there, I can't think.

55
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,817
Frank, get rid of this lot, I've got
two submarines outside

56
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,305
the harbour waiting to come in.
- Willy...

57
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:06,406
Put some proper trousers
on or you'll catch cold.

58
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,432
You'll catch something worse than that
if we don't get those subs in.

59
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,827
It's your ruddy petrol they've got.

60
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:13,935
- You shall have a drop for
your lighter, Willy.

61
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,514
Hello, Eden. Are you all right?

62
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,389
Yes, sir. Just.

63
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,396
They got the Hudson on the ground.

64
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,436
Yes, I know, dammit. Anyone hurt?

65
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,358
No, we were all out in time,
but we now have a lodger.

66
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,358
- A lodger?
- A photographic reconnaissance pilot. Ross.

67
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,392
He was going through to Cairo on the Hudson,
so he's stranded.

68
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,392
Shall I keep him with me
or will your people look after him?

69
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,317
A PR pilot, eh?

70
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,316
I wonder if he's any good.

71
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,469
I don't know.

72
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,318
Rather an odd fish. We talked on the plane.

73
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,432
He got into the PR racket because he'd done
some aerial photography on his job.

74
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,357
He's an archaeologist.

75
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,431
Oh, crikey! That sounds menacing.

76
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,357
Is he...all right?

77
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,469
Yes.

78
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,398
He's not a born military type,
but...I'd back him.

79
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,509
Hm.

80
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,398
Well, come and tell me
how you got on in Whitehall.

81
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,511
(Children chant their times tables)

82
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,317
(Air-raid siren)

83
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,357
(Siren blares)

84
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,356
(Hum of approaching aircraft)

85
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,277
(Distant explosions)

86
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,311
(Bomb whistles)

87
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,509
(Planes roar overhead)

88
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,317
(Fire-engine bell)

89
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,311
(Distant ackack gunfire)

90
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,316
(All-clear siren)

91
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,435
(Children laugh and squeal)

92
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,309
Yes, sir?

93
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,392
Flight Lieutenant Ross.
I'm looking for Wing Commander Bartlett.

94
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,273
Very good, sir.
You'll find him in the Operations Room.

95
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,515
- Up the tunnel, the fourth door
on the right, sir. - Thank you.

96
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,509
- Morning, chum.
- Good morning.

97
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,516
Miss Rivers, there doesn't seem to be
a plot on picture two.

98
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,311
- Get one right away, will you?
- Yes, sir.

99
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,477
Get another radar report on number two
photographic reconnaissance, please.

100
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,353
It should be a matter of
ordinary routine by now.

101
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,358
- Where's the Sicily plane?
- Just crossing the coast.

102
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,391
See you tonight at eight.

103
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,396
- Mind you keep onto him.
- Yes, sir.

104
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,351
Wing Commander Bartlett?

105
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,437
- Who are you? - Flight Lieutenant
Ross, sir. In transit for Cairo.

106
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,397
Thank you, Miss Rivers.

107
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,317
Oh, yes. Cairo.

108
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,358
I'm afraid the old man
would like to have a word with you first.

109
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,355
Oh?

110
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,310
Well done, Hobley. That's four to the
Fleet Air Arm this month. There you are.

111
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,359
I don't know what Nelson would have said
about your flying under RAF command.

112
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,477
The only thing Nelson ever minded about
was scuppering the enemy.

113
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,725
Thank you, sir, but...with respect...

114
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:30,426
If the prize is half a bottle
for sinking a 5,000-ton ship

115
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,519
and a whole bottle for sinking a 10,000-ton
ship, then surely an 8,000-tonner...

116
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,474
And fully loaded, sir.

117
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,318
And amongst eight, all naval.

118
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,476
Oh, all right. I'll stretch a point.

119
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,511
I always had a soft spot for the Navy.

120
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,312
You'll be flying again tonight,
so see your boys go easy on that.

121
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,435
Aye aye, sir.

122
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,278
I don't quite understand
why he should want to see me.

123
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,318
Well, I'm in charge of the photographic unit
and you're a PR pilot.

124
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,476
You can't go on to Cairo
because your Hudson's had it. See?

125
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,317
- No.
- You will.

126
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,436
The old man's good
at making things crystal clear.

127
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,471
Hello, Frank. Save some of
that for me, will you?

128
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,398
You go and sink your own ships,
you candid cameraman.

129
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,475
(Knock at door)
- Come in.

130
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,352
- Flight Lieutenant Ross, sir.
- Ah, yes. Glad to see you, Ross.

131
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,317
Our manna from heaven.

132
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,316
- This is Admiral Banks.
- How do you do, sir?

133
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,318
I sent a signal to the Commander In Chief
Middle East about you,

134
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,399
saying that we'd...Iost a PR pilot and
would he mind if we hung onto you instead.

135
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,317
I've just got his reply.

136
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,429
He doesn't.

137
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,515
Well?

138
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,389
Thank you, sir.

139
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,318
Unorthodox, eh?
Well, this is a rather unorthodox place.

140
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,318
We have to make up our words and music
as we go along, eh, Bartlett?

141
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,315
Yes, sir.

142
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,396
Come and look at this and you'll understand.

143
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,475
The Germans and Italians, all along here.

144
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,515
In Sicily, he's only 58 miles
from our coast.

145
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,514
To the south, here,

146
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,469
Rommel.

147
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,512
Here he is now, doing everything he can
to get through to Egypt

148
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,396
and, after that, the Suez Canal.

149
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,436
You know what that means, don't you?

150
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,438
All the oil in the Middle East
and the route to India.

151
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,478
Right. But, if he's going to succeed,

152
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,513
he's got to be supplied with guns,
men, ammunition and fuel.

153
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,389
Along here...

154
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,317
..or here...

155
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,509
..or down this way.

156
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,511
You see why Malta's got to be held?

157
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,470
So that men like you
can go and find Rommel's supply ships

158
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,476
and men like Hobley can go and sink them.

159
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,469
Or, if we haven't the means,
pass the job on to Middle East Command.

160
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,356
You're what we call
''the eyes of the fleet''.

161
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,517
In this case, the eyes of Malta, and we're
as short of them as everything else.

162
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,316
- Do you see why I grabbed you?
- Yes, I do, sir.

163
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,352
Right. Bartlett's your CO.
He'll fill in the lurid details.

164
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,311
Off you go and get on with it.

165
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,471
- Oh, and Ross.
- Sir?

166
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,357
- Thanks for coming to help us.
- It was the least I could do, sir.

167
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,475
Straight from Gibraltar.

168
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,431
What, in your submarines?

169
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,199
It's a mighty good job
they got here all right...

170
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,817
or we should have been
in a jam for petrol. - Yes.

171
00:13:16,852 --> 00:13:19,342
I've got a bit of tough
news for you, Frank.

172
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:21,582
I'm afraid this is their
last trip for a time.

173
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:24,392
The bases were bombed again last
night and one of the subs was hit.

174
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,431
The others are leaving this afternoon.

175
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,351
For good?

176
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,391
Well, until the raids slacken off a bit.

177
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,509
Pity.

178
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,356
They were the last naval ships in Malta.

179
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,356
Except for a few MTBs.

180
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,474
Yes, it's getting a bit lonely.

181
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,437
I'm damned sorry. You know, if I could,
I'd swim and get the bloody stuff for you.

182
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,357
I know you would, Willy.

183
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,356
But you haven't got any water wings.

184
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,514
8,000 tons.

185
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,514
Fully loaded.

186
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,350
All you have to do
is to get me some more like it.

187
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,513
Of course, you realise Frank's Fleet Air Arm
boys can only deal with very easy targets,

188
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,392
ships that are sinking
practically of their own accord and so on.

189
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,279
If anything has to be really seriously
attacked, then it's a job for me.

190
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,172
I'm afraid I don't know much
about recce over the sea.

191
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:19,118
My speciality is marshalling yards.
- Hm?

192
00:14:19,153 --> 00:14:20,456
I beg your pardon?

193
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,436
''Marshalling yards.'' You know, trains.

194
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,311
I see.

195
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,399
Of course, the only thing that limits a
marshalling-yard specialist here is the er..

196
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,917
Iack of marshalling yards.
- Pity.

197
00:14:31,946 --> 00:14:35,349
I was just developing a rather interesting
technique with marshalling yards.

198
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,788
Still, even if you can't have
your puff-puffs,

199
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,476
you still have your little camera.
Views of great interest abound.

200
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,432
I went on a train once.
That was many years ago.

201
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,319
I seem to remember it ran on shiny things
called ''rails''.

202
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,476
No, that may not have been a train.

203
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,310
That may have been a tram,
bouncing along the Embankment at night,

204
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,315
with the river on one side
and the road on the other, going,

205
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,430
''rrrr-yang-yang

206
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,358
yang-yong ying-yang-yong yong

207
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,311
ying-ying.''

208
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,318
That was a Chinese tram,
but you get the idea.

209
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,276
Never mind about the trams.

210
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,316
I've got a job for you right away.

211
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,337
I'd have liked you to have
been able to stooge

212
00:15:19,338 --> 00:15:22,138
around a bit more and get the
feel of things, but this is urgent.

213
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,587
Fly to Brindisi, get the pictures of the
docks and fly straight back here. Got it?

214
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,398
I still take the same photographs
even if the convoy's not there?

215
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,509
Yes.

216
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,805
You've got long-range tanks,
but go easy

217
00:15:33,806 --> 00:15:36,306
on the juice. There's a mighty
shortage on the island.

218
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,838
And remember what I told you
about radio silence.

219
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:40,808
If you talk while you're up in the air,

220
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:42,786
the enemy fighters will jump
on you like a pile of bricks.

221
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:45,772
Never talk to the ground here, OK?

222
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:47,029
Right.

223
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,431
- Good luck, sir.
- Thank you.

224
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,431
Picture One airborne.

225
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,351
(Atack gunfire)

226
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,438
Your initiative?
Who the devil do you think you are,

227
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,438
messing about taking blasted
pictures 90 miles off your course?

228
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,399
Hasn't it got through to that alleged mind
of yours that we're short of petrol?

229
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,738
Don't you realise that men and ships
are being lost every month

230
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:06,703
trying to bring the stuff to us?
For what?

231
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:09,513
So that you can joyride about the sky
looking for ruddy railway stations?

232
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,312
We've got no time for line-shooting amateurs
in this setup, Ross.

233
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,470
Get the transport to Valletta.
The AOC wants to see you at nine.

234
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,514
- Nine?
- Oh, lose yourself.

235
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,311
- Gharry, sir?
- What?

236
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,356
Gharry. You like ride in my gharry?

237
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,469
Not now.

238
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,397
(Children laughing)

239
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,431
- You know this place?
- Been here all my life.

240
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,516
Well, can you tell me
where I can get a decent meal?

241
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,349
- Meal?
- Mangiare.

242
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,431
Mangiare? (Laughs)

243
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,311
(Air-raid siren)

244
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,476
(Children shout playfully)

245
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,435
I'm so sorry.

246
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,391
(Distant explosions)

247
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,311
Maria!

248
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,469
It's not safe to go outside.

249
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,396
- But I'm late, Father.
- They will understand.

250
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,311
(Explosion)

251
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,351
I'll go.

252
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,349
(Bomb whistles)

253
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,316
Flight Lieutenant Ross, sir.

254
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,351
- Ross, you disobeyed orders.
- Yes, sir.

255
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,469
Why?

256
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,398
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Answer my question. Why?

257
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,398
Well, the freight on that train
looked interesting, sir.

258
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,242
I wondered where it came from,

259
00:20:59,243 --> 00:21:02,885
and if there was any more waiting
at the junction further north.

260
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,276
- There was, sir.
- I see.

261
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,510
So you flew 90 miles off
course to prove it?

262
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,354
This isn't the desert or the Russian front
or even England.

263
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,353
We can't get extra supplies of petrol just
by lifting the phone and asking for them.

264
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,515
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

265
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,517
And we can't waste valuable time
court-martialling flight lieutenants.

266
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,390
From now on, you will fly
strictly to orders.

267
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,311
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

268
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,478
Right. At first light tomorrow,
you will find those trucks of yours again

269
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,479
and you will go on photographing them
until someone tells you to stop.

270
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,431
Well, any questions?

271
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,311
No, sir.

272
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,316
No, unless those trucks...

273
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,509
Precisely. Those trucks.

274
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,514
Come here, Ross, Bartlett.

275
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,431
You see those crates?

276
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,436
They've got gliders inside them.

277
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,391
And they're moving south.

278
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,432
There's only one place
where they could be going, Sicily,

279
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,270
and once they're assembled there, there's
only one purpose they could be used for.

280
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,351
An airborne invasion of this island.

281
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,476
You will photograph those trucks
wherever they go, Ross.

282
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,477
By the time they've unloaded their freight,
you'll never want to see one of them again.

283
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,475
Yes, sir.

284
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,429
- You see that he does it.
- I will, sir.

285
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,397
- All right, Ross.
- Thank you, sir.

286
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,509
- Bartlett.
- Sir?

287
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,317
(Door closes)

288
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,352
All this is top-secret, understand?
Make sure Ross realises it.

289
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,469
Very good, sir.

290
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,399
- When are we getting more Spitfires, sir?
- They're supposed to be on their way.

291
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,476
But if this lot arrives before they do...

292
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,317
Malta...

293
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,429
Yes, sir.

294
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,356
MAN:..are all your guns OK?

295
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,269
Hello.

296
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,309
Hello.

297
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,311
So you weren't killed.

298
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,389
No.

299
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,476
- I hardly ever am.
- You deserve to be.

300
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,476
I was late for my watch here.

301
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,433
- Do you make that journey every evening?
- Of course. I have to come and go home.

302
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,471
I don't think you should do it by yourself.

303
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,513
Perhaps... Perhaps I might have the pleasure
of seeing you home safely.

304
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,276
That would be very kind.

305
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,435
If you were to bring an umbrella...

306
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,311
What for?

307
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,316
To keep the bombs off.

308
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,311
What time do you get away?

309
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,429
Ten o'clock.

310
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,277
All right.

311
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,435
I'll wait for you.

312
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,437
A liaison with the plotters, eh?
Well, it's not a bad thing, up to a point.

313
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,511
I'm only seeing her home.
She's very reckless.

314
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,469
All right, all right. Are you married?

315
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,311
- Certainly not.
- Good.

316
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,271
- Like to try a Maltese beer?
- Thanks.

317
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,352
I'll have you back by ten.
I've got something doing here myself then.

318
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,429
Thank you, sinjur.

319
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,097
I gave him four shillings. Is that
about right?

320
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:15,498
Three would have been enough, really.

321
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,273
- Do you see where you are?
- More or less.

322
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,356
This must have been very beautiful once.

323
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,311
This is our house.

324
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,510
It is rather a funny little
place, I'm afraid.

325
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,514
My father used to build houses.

326
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,318
He built this for us when we lost our home.

327
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,311
He was killed last year.

328
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,475
In a raid.

329
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,431
It's awfully well done.

330
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,311
Please...

331
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,316
Would you like to come in?

332
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,509
Thank you. Yes.

333
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,478
Mother, this is Flight Lieutenant Ross.

334
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,472
- Welcome to our home, Mr Ross.
- Thank you, Mrs Gonzar.

335
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,513
Forgive me if I go on doing this.
It is powdered milk for my grandson Ninu.

336
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,318
This is his father, my son, Paolo,

337
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,356
and his wife Carmela.

338
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,356
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

339
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,277
Are you a fighter pilot?

340
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,469
No, I just take photographs.

341
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,308
You take photographs of enemy targets
for our bombers, Mr Ross?

342
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,316
- Yes.
- Ah, yes. I'm anti-aircraft.

343
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,396
- Oh, really?
- I have a battery on the coast.

344
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,318
I'm on a few hours' leave,
the first for many months.

345
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,476
- Chocolate!
- (Whispers) Say thank you.

346
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,317
Thank you.

347
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,515
(Air-raid siren)

348
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,429
There we go again.

349
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,353
Well, Mr Ross, are we going to be invaded?

350
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,510
Mother, I tell you, you know
nothing about it.

351
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,359
She will listen to Rome Radio.
It is sometimes very funny, this propaganda.

352
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,472
Paolo is, of course, our military expert,
but I also read.

353
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,351
I use my eyes...

354
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,355
(Explosion)

355
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,469
..and my ears.

356
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,353
And still she knows nothing. Nothing.

357
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,398
You must all know more about it than I do.
I've only just come here.

358
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,668
And the first thing you meet is
Maria and all the silly Gonzars.

359
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,317
That is bad luck for you, Mr Ross.
- Not at all. On the contrary.

360
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,511
Take no notice of Mother, Mr Ross. It is
well known one must take no notice of her.

361
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,390
These are, of course, only
my silly children.

362
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,318
I have also a clever son, Giuseppe.

363
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,396
Who is so clever, the Italians caught him.

364
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,509
Really?

365
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,389
- A prisoner?
- No.

366
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,353
He was studying in Italy
when the Italians declared war.

367
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,271
So now he is interned.

368
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,435
But he's safe?

369
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,311
Oh, yes.

370
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,430
Sometimes, I have letters from him.

371
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,308
Of course, they are censored,
but we know he is safe.

372
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,430
(Explosion)
- Safer than we are, by the sound of it.

373
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,351
Giuseppe would be here,

374
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,277
if he could.

375
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,509
(Explosions continue)

376
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,389
You hear?

377
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,438
It is getting much heavier
than it was a few weeks ago.

378
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,432
They say so here.
Of course, they cannot tell us everything,

379
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,318
but what they do tell us is true.

380
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,437
It is building up for something, Mr Ross.

381
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,317
(Cock crows)

382
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,311
RAF?

383
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,395
Yes.

384
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,475
- Here we are.
- Right.

385
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,317
Goodbye.

386
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,395
BARTLETT: Bye-bye.

387
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,396
ALL: Goodbye!

388
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,317
Bye.

389
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,356
- What a good bunch they are.
- Yes.

390
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,570
Joan...

391
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:18,471
I think there's an order coming out about
Englishwomen who can leaving the island.

392
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,476
Splendid. Even less competition.

393
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,353
I dare say, but I think
you ought to get out of here.

394
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,359
Sir, do you realise just what would happen
to that Operations Room without me?

395
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,473
Here I am, practically defending the island
single-handed, and you have the cheek to...

396
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,313
No, but quite seriously, I think it's
much wiser.

397
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,396
One can't just go around
being wise, darling.

398
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,318
Gosh, it's lovely to be out
of it all for a few hours.

399
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,277
(Aeroplane on strafing run)

400
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,312
Well, well, well. This is a new development.

401
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,351
See what I mean about getting out of here?

402
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,392
Nonsense. I shouldn't think of leaving
if they act in that rude way.

403
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,273
(Machine-gun fire)
- My God, John, the bus!

404
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,278
Well...that's jolly, isn't it?

405
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,432
The Intelligence people are
regretful but definite.

406
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,438
- Have we got any bombers to have
a go at 'em? - Not after last night.

407
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,318
Matthews hasn't a serviceable plane left.

408
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,476
- You couldn't use fighters?
- 15 serviceable.

409
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,430
If we lose those, there'll be
no air defence at all.

410
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,272
- Did you see the crates?
- They're being loaded onto barges.

411
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,430
I should think some of them
are in Sicily already.

412
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,313
If they're on their way to
Sicily, that settles it.

413
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,319
If only we'd got a couple of squadrons
of bombers, instead of this mess.

414
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,432
You'd better go and get rested up.
Probably do with it.

415
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,316
A nice long sleep.

416
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,436
(Buzzer)

417
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,436
(Hum of conversations)

418
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,475
Hello, Peter.

419
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,358
I wanted to apologise for not
having come in. I've been busy.

420
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,476
- I know. I have been watching you.
- Watching me?

421
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,308
Oh, yes. I always forget
that you come on these expeditions.

422
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,435
I'll remember in future.

423
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,393
Anyhow, I've got 12 hours off and
I thought we might go out somewhere.

424
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,471
What you need is sleep, not going out.

425
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,398
You go and sleep first, Peter,
then we'll see.

426
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,429
Go along.

427
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,396
You're quite right.

428
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,436
(Buzzer)

429
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,515
Sir?

430
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,274
See, it's just a mess, sir.
Can't do anything with it.

431
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,356
No, that's jamming all right again.

432
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,469
When did you say it started?

433
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,469
Well, there it is, gentlemen.

434
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,479
Massed raids on the airfields, low-level
attacks on the civilian population.

435
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,396
And I've just had a report
they're jamming on radar.

436
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,396
It all adds up to an invasion.

437
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,357
And soon.

438
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,470
- When are the Spitfires actually due?
- Any time now.

439
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,476
Depends when the carrier can get them off.

440
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,476
I can't do anything much until they show up.

441
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,431
I have nothing to do it with.

442
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,358
I'm sure that both of you
have done everything possible.

443
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,392
I can't help thinking
that while I must keep the defences manned,

444
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,398
the most important thing
is to keep the airfields serviceable,

445
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,510
- in case your Spitfires do get
here in time. - Agreed.

446
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,272
We'd better go on using as many
of my fellows as we can on the airfields,

447
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,396
even if it leaves us a bit light elsewhere.

448
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,317
Thank you, General.

449
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,516
Not at all. I'm sure everybody
will be charmed.

450
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,476
It's a fine day off we're having.

451
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,805
Perce, if it takes 30 tons
to fill one hole

452
00:33:00,806 --> 00:33:03,506
and we filled 14 this morning,
how many tons is that?

453
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,353
Far too many. And a
lot of good it'll do too.

454
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,356
The buzz is there's 50 Spitfires coming.

455
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,358
There's been 50 Spitfires coming
ever since I've been here

456
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,517
- and all that's come is about 500 Jerries.
(Whistle blows urgently)

457
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,276
(Klaxon)

458
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,351
Another 30 tons, Perce.

459
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,436
- Ah, what did I tell you?
(Bomb whistles)

460
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,429
60 tons.

461
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,472
- Hey, there's Millie out in
the middle of it. - Millie!

462
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,277
Millie!

463
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,277
Millie!

464
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,273
(Machine-gun fire)

465
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,396
(Plane screeches)

466
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,359
SERGEANT: Fall in, No.2 Section.
Come on. Move it sharpish. Come on.

467
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:39,389
Fall in, No.2 Section. Come on, come on.
You're not a bunch of ballet dancers.

468
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,318
- Right turn. Quick march.
- Where to now, sarge?

469
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,432
We're going to that field to dig some
big holes and put long straight poles in,

470
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,431
so the Germans can't land their aircraft.

471
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,391
That's what's called air strategy.

472
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,695
You roll the ruddy runway
so people can land,

473
00:34:51,696 --> 00:34:54,296
then you stick poles up
in it so they can't.

474
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,355
That's good, that is.

475
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,469
All runways serviceable now, sir.

476
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,395
Good.

477
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,438
Yes, 47 Spitfires on their way now.

478
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,398
You'll take 27. 10 each to go
to Hal Far and Ta' Qali.

479
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,396
OK. Good luck.

480
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,312
All three airfields ready to
receive Spitfires, sir.

481
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,436
Fine. If the Germans let
us get away with it.

482
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,396
Right. Let's have them on the table.

483
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,268
They're flying the Spits in
from the American carrier Wasp.

484
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,436
It's a long haul, but they'll
just about make it.

485
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,433
Then, if only the Germans
will give us time to get them refuelled.

486
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,356
CONTROLLER: Table clear of enemy raid, sir.

487
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,396
Let's hope it stays clear.

488
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,276
But as late as this...

489
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,436
.. I'm afraid they'll just catch it.

490
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,316
100-plus bandits approaching the coast.

491
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,469
(Order shouted)

492
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,509
(Order shouted)

493
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,475
Fire!

494
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,389
Eight more Spits to come in, sir.

495
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,316
Runway being heavily bombed, sir.

496
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,277
(Plane screeches)

497
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,476
(Distant explosions)

498
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,511
You must not go outside, Mother.
It is a very heavy raid.

499
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,276
It is not here, it is on the airfield.

500
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,510
It will be the new Spitfires they're after.

501
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,514
Do not be afraid, Carmela.

502
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,276
If they hit us, it will be a mistake.

503
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,437
For once they have something better to do
than to try and kill Ninu.

504
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,476
(Distant rumbling)

505
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,391
Very disappointing.

506
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,432
- You know how many Spits we lost
last night? - I heard it was 15.

507
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,308
20. 20 out of 47 and they
weren't even airborne.

508
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,357
Of course, turning up then
they just caught the dusk raids.

509
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,358
Have you seen this, sir?
I thought it might cheer you up a bit.

510
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,437
GOVERNOR: We who have been thought
worthy of this high honour and distinction

511
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,436
must see that we live worthy of it,

512
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,519
and, in this critical time, that we do
not shrink from giving all we have.

513
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,430
Malta has shown the world
that she can endure

514
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,398
and the world knows that
she will never weaken.

515
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,474
But not until the inevitable day of victory
can the whole story of Malta GC be told.

516
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,438
The safety of this fortress rests under God,
on four supports -

517
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,393
the three fighting services
and the civilian population.

518
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,353
Each one of these is essential to the others
and to the whole.

519
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,399
As we are co-recipients of the great honour
bestowed by His Majesty the King,

520
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,438
Iet us also be sure
that we are really co-operative,

521
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,473
and making this co-operation
ever more complete and effective,

522
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,355
go forward together
in our united strength and faith.

523
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,351
(Scrapes bowl)

524
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,278
But it is for two... and a child.

525
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,471
That's right. It's for two and a child.
It's been cut again, you know.

526
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,308
It is for your mousetrap.
It is a mouse's portion.

527
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,316
You have been a long time.

528
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,316
There are now no buses.

529
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,396
Yes, yes. You shall have it. Now, sit down.

530
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,316
But where is yours?

531
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,272
I have eaten mine. I was hungry.

532
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,311
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

533
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,278
You can see
that that is not the ration for three.

534
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,355
Carmela!

535
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,271
No, I myself am not hungry.

536
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,390
It is absurd to say always
you are not hungry.

537
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,476
You will eat yours or I shall be very cross.

538
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,352
And you are not to give it to the little pig
who is already fat.

539
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,317
Carmela! Mother!

540
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,430
- Two ships are in.
- Food ships?

541
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,393
Yes. Big ones, or fairly big,
and more coming tonight. Come and see.

542
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,391
(Distant cheering)

543
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,318
(Ship's hooter)

544
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,316
(Cheering)

545
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,311
(Cheering continues)

546
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,478
What about it now, then, Harry?
Won't never get through, eh?

547
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,318
I thought there were 17 of them.
That was the yarn.

548
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,477
- What's happened to the rest of them?
- They've been fighting for four days.

549
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,476
You can't expect 'em all to
arrive in a heap.

550
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,471
- So, the rest's coming, eh?
- Yeah.

551
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,432
Aye. Aye, it's just a bit of a delay.

552
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,438
I'll bet they'll be in tonight,
most of 'em, anyway.

553
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,391
Here...come on, misery.

554
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,316
- Celebration, see?
- Ta.

555
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,469
GOVERNOR: I must now break to you what
the arrival of only two ships means to us.

556
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,397
This is a siege.

557
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,398
We shall be called upon this summer
to bear all the privations

558
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,319
of soldiers and citizens in a besieged city.

559
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,399
We are short of food, water,
clothes and fuel.

560
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,439
But let us remember
that the most glorious sieges in history

561
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,436
have always meant hardships...

562
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,268
.. and without hardships
there would be little glory.

563
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,316
It is perhaps not glory that we lack.

564
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,436
They' ll get more through next time.

565
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,350
This is the only one
that's been properly excavated.

566
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,436
The Temple of Mnajdra
has hardly been touched.

567
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,357
MARIA: No.

568
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,475
Ah.

569
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,318
- Oh, do you see that that's been worked?
- Mm-hm.

570
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,106
Oh, it really is heartbreaking

571
00:44:41,107 --> 00:44:45,327
to be spending one's time
taking photographs of ports...

572
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,203
..when there's all this...waiting.

573
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,436
- Peter.
- Yes?

574
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,399
- Do you think they will come?
- Who, the Germans? I shouldn't think so.

575
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,316
Why not? They have many more planes.

576
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,511
- There's nothing much to stop it.
- I don't think things happen like that.

577
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,437
I mean, not just by counting up.
There are other things that decide.

578
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,357
You mean God?

579
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,316
More that sort of thing.

580
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,311
You have faith, as we are told to have?

581
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,316
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

582
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,509
Anyhow, does it matter very much?

583
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,392
- What do you mean, does it matter?
- It matters now, that's what we're doing,

584
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,318
seeing that they don't take Malta,
that's the job in hand. I meant that

585
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,315
a temporary loss of civilisation probably
doesn't matter much in the long run.

586
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,856
After all, people have been
fighting their wars

587
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:39,357
around this place for 5,000 years
or more. It's still here.

588
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,314
Phoenicians, Greeks, Turks -
they've all come...and gone.

589
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,316
I don't know what you mean.

590
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,511
I don't care about the Phoenicians
and Turks. I only care about us.

591
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,439
You realise, if they did come and capture
Malta, we should be separated.

592
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,271
Doesn't that matter to you?

593
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,357
Yes, that does matter.

594
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,510
Because we must be together, mustn't we?

595
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,308
And when there is no war,
come here and talk.

596
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,316
If it must happen, it will happen.

597
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,474
We'll come here and talk.

598
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,316
And they won't take Malta.

599
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,316
You do believe that too, don't you?

600
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,436
Yes, Peter.

601
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,476
Yes, I do.

602
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,431
I am quite sure.

603
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,318
When we took the place first,
the garden was just a jungle.

604
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,473
I just got the lawn going. Cost me a
packet with grass seed the price it is,

605
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,433
and now I get a letter from Margaret
saying everybody's digging for victory,

606
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,516
so she's digging it up and
planting cabbages.

607
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,514
Cabbages...in my lawn.

608
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,470
- How big is the lawn?
- Oh, it's only about 20 yards square.

609
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,476
Quite a small garden, but very nice.

610
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,318
Particularly in the spring - lots of bulbs.

611
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,472
- Margaret says the daffodils are
good this year. (Knock at door)

612
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,398
Will you have your bread now, sir,
or save it for lunch?

613
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,396
Oh, lunch.

614
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,391
(Winces)

615
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,312
I'm tired of kitchen soap and cold water.

616
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,515
- Cypher, sir.
- Oh, give it to the admiral, will you?

617
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,477
If that's another query of our morale,
I'll cut my throat.

618
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,271
Well, what is it?

619
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,351
How many Spitfires would you like, Frank?

620
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,356
Oh, think of a number and double it.

621
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,356
60 any good?

622
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,356
Read it, please, Willy.

623
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,437
60 Spitfires will be flown in to Malta
from the American carrier Wasp

624
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,358
in three days from now, timed
to land in daylight.

625
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,110
On the next day, the unescorted
minelayer Welshman will arrive

626
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,308
Grand Harbour with a cargo of petrol, oil,
aircraft spares, food and powdered milk.

627
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,511
Powdered milk's good.
They think of everything, don't they?

628
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,351
Three days.

629
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,356
Well, if Jerry gives us that long.

630
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,431
Though I don't much see why he should.

631
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,396
(Reads) In addition to which...

632
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,469
What?

633
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,039
Vice Admiral Payne

634
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,375
will arrive in the Welshman to take
up duties as Vice Admiral Malta.

635
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,359
Vice Admiral Banks will take passage
in Welshman to Gibraltar.

636
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,356
Oh, no, Willy.

637
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,356
Well, I was expecting it.

638
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,392
I've been here six months longer
than I should anyway.

639
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,431
Payne's a good chap. You'll like him.

640
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,272
I'm glad the Spitfires will arrive
before I go, though.

641
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,390
Yes...Iong as nothing else arrives first.

642
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,353
Well, if they get here in time, and in
daylight, Jerry may burn his fingers.

643
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,356
Star-Spangled Banner

644
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,430
Now, every Spitfire will
have its own number.

645
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,278
As each machine lands
and taxies off the runway,

646
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:10,396
it'll be met by one of you on a motorcycle.

647
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,319
Your machine will have the same number
written on a board

648
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,396
and mounted above the back wheel.

649
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,352
You will lead the aircraft
to the pen allotted to it,

650
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,432
where it will be refuelled and rearmed
straightaway.

651
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,515
- Sergeant Vella?
- Sir?

652
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,390
No ammunition restriction
for the next eight hours.

653
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,396
Very good, sir.

654
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,193
OK, Peter, is that clear? I'll bring
Blue Section into Ta' Qali

655
00:49:34,194 --> 00:49:36,494
and you bring Red Section
over the harbour into Luqa.

656
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,308
If we get this lot in OK, perhaps
they'll think twice about their gliders.

657
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,395
Yeah.

658
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,472
Raid's dispersed, sir.
The table's clear of enemy aircraft.

659
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,398
- Any sign of the Spitfires yet?
- No, sir.

660
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,356
Hello? Hello?

661
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,356
Yes. Fine.

662
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,390
Here we are, sir. Guests approaching coast.

663
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,351
We've made it, Frank.

664
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,271
It looks like it.

665
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,393
What was it the Duke of Wellington said
after Waterloo? 'A darn close-run thing.'

666
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,255
Well, now, if our German friends
will give us half an hour,

667
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,356
we'll be delighted to see them.

668
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,432
Don't open fire. Friendly aircraft
approaching from the northwest.

669
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,393
Cease firing. Friendly aircraft
approaching from the northwest.

670
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,514
(Cheering)

671
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,274
Hello, Red Guests. This is Red Host.
Follow me, please. Over.

672
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,436
Number 17, number 6.

673
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,309
Number 3.

674
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,316
TANNOY: Number 47.

675
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,389
Follow number 3.

676
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,436
Follow number 17.

677
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,475
TANNOY: Number 22.

678
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,515
Number 15.

679
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,515
Number 5.

680
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,277
Number 38.

681
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,469
Number 12.

682
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,357
Number 16.

683
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,271
Number 22.

684
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,431
Man your guns. Stand by for enemy attack.

685
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,311
All right, sir.

686
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,395
TANNOY: Number 41.

687
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,395
Number 27.

688
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,515
Number 11.

689
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,355
Number 19.

690
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,278
- Aircraft due north, sir.
- Can't be the Spits.

691
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,356
No, it's not Spitfires.

692
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,514
Sir, 40-plus bandits approaching.

693
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,312
- How many Spits have we got there?
- 31 rearmed and refuelled, sir.

694
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,316
- Get 'em up.
- Scramble.

695
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,352
Come on, Willy. Your farewell party.
We can't miss this.

696
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,471
CONTROLLER: Fighter Squadron, scramble.

697
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,431
Fighter Squadron, scramble.

698
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,515
TANNOY: Number 52.

699
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,276
(Machine-gun fire)

700
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,311
(Distant machine-gun fire)

701
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,430
(Planes roar overhead)

702
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,391
(Ship's hooter)

703
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,437
Then, of course,
as soon as any food does come, I go - ha!

704
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,314
- Ah, well. Goodbye, Payne. I wish you luck.
- Goodbye.

705
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,311
Keep this fellow Frank in his place.

706
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,511
Don't think because he hasn't got as loud a
voice as mine you can boss him. He's tough.

707
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,514
I'm used to tough admirals.

708
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,435
Don't forget us, Willy.

709
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,359
''Malta, my dear sir, is in my thoughts,
sleeping or waking.''

710
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,318
- You know who said that?
- No, I'm afraid not.

711
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,475
Horatio Nelson.

712
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,431
You're very ignorant, Frank.

713
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,476
I'll read him up between raids.

714
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,277
- And, Frank?
- Yes?

715
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,437
Keep your chin up. The convoy
will be through to you in a few days.

716
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,316
Keep hitting 'em, my boys.

717
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,276
(High-pitched whistle)

718
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,357
JOAN: My mother always used to say
you shouldn't bathe after a heavy meal.

719
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,392
At least that's one thing
we don't have to worry about.

720
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,436
Look, Peter, don't wait for us.
I shall be hours yet.

721
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,393
- You and Maria go. We'll see you later.
- Oh, OK. We'll move on.

722
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,351
What did you do that for?

723
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,358
Darling, have a heart.
They want to be by themselves.

724
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,439
Peter...it is known
one must take no notice of Mother.

725
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,436
That's what you all say.

726
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,473
If she says no, I cannot marry you,
then I will marry you all the same.

727
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,396
Do you think she will say no?

728
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,317
Perhaps not.

729
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:50,275
But she will put her head so and say...
but and but and but.

730
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,276
One must take no notice, you see.

731
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,358
Because we know, don't we,
that nothing will happen.

732
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,392
I dare say they are a pretty pair,
but I'm not sure it's a good thing.

733
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,472
He's talking about marrying her.
Came and asked my permission yesterday.

734
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,478
- What did you say? - I said to
think it over when he cooled off a bit.

735
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,475
I can't stop him, but if he goes on,
I shall tell him what I think.

736
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,398
- Which is?
- You have to travel light in war.

737
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,359
Now, look, darling, I don't mean us.
We've had all this out before.

738
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,272
John, do you still want to marry me?

739
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:30,312
Yes, Joan. Yes, of course I do.

740
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,272
But I want to marry you in England,
where we belong.

741
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,510
I want our families to be there
and I want our friends...

742
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,911
The bride, who was given
away by her father,

743
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,349
wore a Renaissance-style gown
of ivory satin. - And why not?

744
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,298
Isn't that a better way
to make a start than...

745
00:58:43,299 --> 00:58:45,913
out here in the middle
of a permanent air raid?

746
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,133
Never knowing which one of us
is going to be killed next.

747
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,314
Maybe. I never was much of a girl
for the trimmings myself.

748
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,395
Trimmings?

749
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,318
I don't give a darn about
the wedding breakfast.

750
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,510
At least I don't want my wife to be starved.

751
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:07,535
WIRELESS: You're short of food.

752
00:59:07,536 --> 00:59:10,436
The ships that were to have
brought food for your children

753
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:13,982
are at the bottom of
the Mediterranean.

754
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:19,394
Please help us, but above all,
help yourselves, by surrendering now.

755
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,052
That's the end of our
afternoon talk to Malta.

756
00:59:23,053 --> 00:59:27,353
The orchestra will now play the Maltilla.
(Door opens)

757
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,353
- Good afternoon, Mr Ross.
WIRELESS: Maltilla

758
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,436
Good afternoon, Mrs Gonzar.

759
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,356
- Give me this.
- Thank you.

760
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,476
You may know why
I've come here this afternoon.

761
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,349
I may.

762
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,432
I want to marry Maria.
I wanted to ask your permission.

763
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,392
I am glad you should ask,
but there is no need.

764
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:55,512
Maria is a woman now and knows her own mind.

765
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,318
Yes, but I wanted to talk to you.

766
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,436
You are a good man.

767
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,436
It is not because of you that...

768
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,272
Yes?

769
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,356
Maria has never been outside this island.

770
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,278
Your home is a thousand miles away.

771
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:21,273
When the war is ended, will
you take her there?

772
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,435
Of course.

773
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,439
And if it does not end...
if Malta is taken by the enemy?

774
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,438
You shouldn't listen to that.
It's just propaganda.

775
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:34,270
When they said they would drop
7,000 tons of bombs on us in a month,

776
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,276
it was called propaganda.

777
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,276
But it was true, Mr Ross.

778
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,278
Wherever I went I would take Maria with me.

779
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,356
You would like to take her, Mr Ross...

780
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,359
..but war destroys many hopes...many plans.

781
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,318
But, Mrs Gonzar, don't you see,
one can't live like that.

782
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,312
You might as well say
that a man shouldn't get married

783
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:01,273
because he may be run over by a bus
the next day or struck by lightning.

784
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,313
Ah, yes, when you are young
you feel the lightning cannot harm you.

785
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,356
It's very rare to be struck by lightning.

786
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:13,399
And if it does strike...
one's done one's best by not being afraid.

787
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,356
You may be right, Mr Ross.

788
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,356
And if you are not, you should be.

789
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,312
But I am older than you
and perhaps no longer brave.

790
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:30,353
We have all said that Malta will never
surrender, and that is true, Mr Ross.

791
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,269
But we must not say these brave things
without facing what they mean.

792
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,396
It may mean to starve to death...

793
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,392
..to see loved ones die...as I have done.

794
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,395
Don't you hate us?

795
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,349
Hate you?

796
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,436
The British...for being here.

797
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,351
For bringing all this on you.

798
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,396
I do not hate anybody.

799
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,395
I am Maltese.

800
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:15,316
We Maltese do not like war, but it has
always been our fate and our destiny.

801
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:20,359
If there is to be war and we must be on
a side, yours is the side we would choose.

802
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:28,389
Mr Ross...I cannot stop you
from marrying Maria.

803
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,276
I wouldn't if I could.

804
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,479
But I ask you to wait
for just a little while.

805
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,271
But if we wait...

806
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,355
Yes?

807
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,276
You're quite right, of course.

808
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:55,272
It would be better for Maria to wait.

809
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:08,399
He was picked up down at the foot of the
cliff by some of our British ackack boys.

810
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,472
He spun a yarn about being a Maltese
who'd escaped from Sicily.

811
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,398
They found his radio transmitter
and arrested him.

812
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,318
He'd obviously been put ashore
from a submarine.

813
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:21,433
He speaks perfect Maltese, yet he says now
that he's an Italian named Ricardi.

814
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,472
I have my doubts about that.
I think he probably is Maltese.

815
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:28,354
- Have you any idea what he's after?
- No, sir. I haven't talked to him much yet.

816
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,311
This'll tell you.

817
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,432
(Reads) Essential that full-scale attacks
are resumed against convoys.

818
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,391
I rely on you to provide maximum effort.

819
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:39,353
Well, sir, that'd be very nice of them,
if they'd give us something to do it with.

820
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,391
Well, don't worry, this time they have.

821
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,392
This convoy left Gib for Malta
at 21.00 hours last night.

822
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,391
It's the biggest yet.

823
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:52,433
With two aircraft carriers
and every available escort vessel.

824
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,473
14 merchant ships and, what matters most,

825
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,358
a large oil tanker - the Ohio.

826
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,479
If it gets through, then we shall go a
long way towards scuppering Rommel.

827
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,436
If it doesn't...

828
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,393
I don't know what your pal with the
radio set thought he could do from here,

829
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,477
but I do know they'll do everything on earth
to stop that convoy.

830
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,356
Why were you sent here?

831
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,272
Look, I've plenty of time.
You'll tell me in the end.

832
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,436
Why not save us both the trouble
and tell me now?

833
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,316
Why were you sent here?

834
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,391
(Alarm)

835
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,436
(Ship's hooter)

836
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,469
Engage!

837
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,509
Engage!

838
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,475
(Ringing)

839
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,509
(Bomb whistles)

840
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,514
Why were you sent here?

841
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,278
You know as well as I do.
The whole island knows.

842
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,311
Anyway, you're not an Italian, are you?

843
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,474
And your name isn't Ricardi, is it?

844
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,436
You're a Maltese.

845
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,436
And your name?

846
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,358
Look, darling,
I just wanted to say there's a big job on.

847
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,395
- Yes.
- You know?

848
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,273
Yes. The whole island is praying.

849
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,476
It is the novena to Our Lady
from now to the 15th.

850
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:02,513
Well, the 15th is just about the time
they'll get here...if they get here.

851
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:05,986
I just want to say that I'll be
a bit tied up

852
01:06:05,987 --> 01:06:10,407
until then... and won't
see much of you.

853
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,436
All right, Peter.

854
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,476
I shall be watching you.

855
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,357
Take care of yourself.

856
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,314
You say your son's letters come
fairly regularly, Mrs Gonzar?

857
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,351
Fairly.

858
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,358
The last was about...six weeks ago.

859
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:39,318
Does he ever express any opinions
about the war?

860
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,475
Oh, no.

861
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,391
The letters are censored, of course.

862
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:49,397
Just ordinary letters asking
about the family.

863
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,317
Mm-hm.

864
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,351
Mrs Gonzar...

865
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,395
..is that your son?

866
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,317
Oh, yes.

867
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,357
Yes.

868
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,316
That is Giuseppe.

869
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:11,392
Something...something has happened to him.

870
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,475
Yes.

871
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,476
Is he...dead?

872
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:19,469
No.

873
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:25,519
I hate to have to tell you this, Mrs Gonzar,
but your son is in the prison here.

874
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,316
He was found on the shore.

875
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:35,275
He had a wireless transmitter with him and
he was put ashore from an Italian submarine.

876
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,436
You mean he was...

877
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,436
.. he was spying?

878
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,357
Giuseppe?

879
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,435
Yes.

880
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,316
What will they do to him?

881
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,476
I... I don't know.

882
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,436
You mean they will shoot him as a spy?

883
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:03,509
Oh, no.

884
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,436
A traitor is hanged.

885
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,316
I must go to him.

886
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,515
They will not stop me.
Say they will not stop me.

887
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,276
I must go to him.

888
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:20,472
- Giuseppe. - I can't promise that.
It's not in my hands.

889
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,354
But if I can get permission
for you to see him... I will.

890
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,309
(Sobs)

891
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:51,313
Your mother had to know, because otherwise
I couldn't be sure who you were.

892
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,233
There's no reason why any of the
rest of your family should ever be told,

893
01:08:54,234 --> 01:08:56,474
or anybody else...

894
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,898
..if you help me.

895
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,475
Thank you.

896
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:02,514
It is of some importance.

897
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:06,471
- Go on. What do you want to know?
- Why you were sent here.

898
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,317
You know about the convoy.

899
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,429
Mm.

900
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:17,268
There must be an oil tanker.
In fact, there is bound to be one.

901
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,275
Yes.

902
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,276
If she got through...

903
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:24,393
I had to find the positions of the fuel
dumps after she had been unloaded...

904
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,358
..and signal them back
so that they could be bombed.

905
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:33,399
I'm not a traitor. I'm not a traitor!
This is my country, not yours!

906
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,396
You've no right here.

907
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,277
You were the only one?

908
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:41,351
They wanted someone who spoke Maltese.

909
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,316
(Reads) Cruisers Manchester and Cairo,

910
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,278
Destroyer Foresight and five merchant ships.

911
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:06,312
That's eight of the convoy
and four of the escort gone...

912
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,470
..including one of the aircraft carriers.

913
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:14,437
Well, nobody can say they're not
doing their damnedest to help us.

914
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,357
No.

915
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:21,432
Jim Hill's boy is in the Manchester.
I hope he got away with it.

916
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:25,473
- Nice boy, I remember him at Dartmouth...
- Oh, to hell with Jim Hill's boy!

917
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,358
- I beg your pardon, Payne.
- That's all right.

918
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:38,404
I never knew a job in which one just...
waited around so much. What was it...

919
01:11:38,439 --> 01:11:41,513
you told me Willy Banks used to say
- ''I'll go and swim for the stuff''?

920
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,355
Yes.

921
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:48,399
Well, by tomorrow what's left of them ought
to be within range of our Beaufighters.

922
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,396
After that the Spits can follow up.

923
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,356
Six hours to first light.

924
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,316
Then we can go, thank God.

925
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,476
(Deep rumbling)

926
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,396
(Ackack gunfire)

927
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,476
(Recites prayer)

928
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:40,316
(Congregation recites prayer)

929
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,436
They should be over the convoy
in half an hour, sir.

930
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:53,313
You mean...they should be
over what's left of it.

931
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,356
Get my car out, Pearse.

932
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:01,393
And if Admiral Payne rings here...
I've gone back to the Operations Room.

933
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,351
Very good, sir.

934
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,312
CONTROLLER:
Pedestal now ten miles ahead of you. Out.

935
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,511
The fighters should sight Pedestal Convoy
at any minute now, sir.

936
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,396
OPERATOR:
Yes, we must keep one runway open.

937
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:26,433
Sir, another 25-plus bandits
approaching Pedestal from the north.

938
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:31,270
CONTROLLER: Hello, Epsom Leader, 25-plus
bandits approaching Pedestal from the north.

939
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,271
Engage!

940
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,276
(Bell rings)
- Engage!

941
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,357
(Bomb whistles)

942
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,397
Hello, Epsom Leader. Vector 2-9-0.

943
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,516
Buster. Buster. Over.

944
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,276
Tally-ho. Bandits ahead and below.

945
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:16,357
Green Section break away. Take
high-level bombers. Blue Section up sun.

946
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:38,512
PILOT: Got him. That's a beauty.
Close in, number two.

947
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:42,392
Get up, you clot! Green three,
watch your tail!

948
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:45,352
(Machine-gun fire)
- He's on fire. Got him!

949
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,357
Hello, Pedestal, this is Epsom Leader.
I think they've had it now.

950
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,356
Am taking up umbrella cover. Over.

951
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,317
This is Pedestal.

952
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:26,392
Thank you, Epsom. Nice work.
We're very glad to see you.

953
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,510
Not nearly so glad as we
are to see you, chum.

954
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:49,389
(Ship's hooter)

955
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,477
Four, eh?
Well, that's more than last time, anyway.

956
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,469
And full of lovely grub.

957
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,398
Aye, but not a ruddy tanker
among the lot of them.

958
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:05,517
What do you think we're going
to fly the planes on - dried milk?

959
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,390
What the hell's happened to the Ohio, eh?

960
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:10,429
She was hit six times, sir.

961
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:16,353
After she'd been abandoned, parties of
volunteers got back on board...twice.

962
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,396
Each time she was hit again.

963
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:24,268
She was still afloat the last time
we saw her, but on fire aft.

964
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:29,359
I should like to say, sir, that everyone
realised the importance of getting her in.

965
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,356
They did their best.

966
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,436
It's all right, Whittaker. We know that.

967
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,476
What are you going to do now, sir?

968
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,308
Well, that's our headache, my boy.
You go and get some rest.

969
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,316
Thank you, sir.

970
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,352
Well, as a matter of interest,
what are we going to do now?

971
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:59,432
They may hang me...
but that doesn't make me a traitor.

972
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,514
Malta is my country...

973
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:08,438
..and what I wanted to do was to save her
from any more of this suffering and misery.

974
01:17:09,052 --> 01:17:13,213
You and...you and Paolo and Maria...

975
01:17:13,214 --> 01:17:15,622
all of you, you're good people.

976
01:17:15,657 --> 01:17:17,930
But you don't understand these things.

977
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:21,318
From where I was, I could see it all.

978
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,085
The British are finished. They cannot win.

979
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:30,713
Why should Malta go on being crucified
when a few bold strokes would save us all?

980
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,271
You do see, Mother?

981
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:41,270
You do know that what I was trying to do
was the best for Malta and for all of you?

982
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,439
You chose your side...as
we have all had to do.

983
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:50,393
Yes, but my side was the right side -
the sensible side that would bring peace.

984
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:53,318
You chose as you thought right, my son.

985
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,276
We have done the same.

986
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,470
The choices were different, that is all.

987
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,396
Ah...well.

988
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:08,437
At least you will not be
pointed at in Malta.

989
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,436
I have arranged that.

990
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,396
- How's Paolo?
- Well.

991
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,351
And Maria?

992
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,316
She is well too.

993
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:25,318
It is best that they should
not know about this.

994
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,432
Not for my sake, you understand,
but for theirs.

995
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:35,479
You will tell them that you have had a
letter to say that I have died in Italy.

996
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,430
Oh...

997
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,358
Oh, you know I would have wished
to stay and help you.

998
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,357
Giuseppe.

999
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:51,353
Is it permitted that I give my son this?

1000
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,356
It is only a crucifix.

1001
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,356
No, madam, I'm sorry.

1002
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,431
But I'll give it to the priest for him.

1003
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,396
I'll make sure he gets it.

1004
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,429
(Bell tolls)

1005
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,397
You see...

1006
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,277
.. I am dead now.

1007
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,278
You cannot touch me or give me anything.

1008
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,436
Except your blessing.

1009
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,436
They will not mind that.

1010
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,396
I loved you all...

1011
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,276
..but I am dead now.

1012
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,476
Give me your blessing, Mother...

1013
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:39,436
(Tearfully)..and go.

1014
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:12,312
Frank...your tanker's coming in.

1015
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:17,353
They've managed to put out the fire. To stop
her sinking she's lashed to a destroyer.

1016
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,436
Thank God for the Navy.

1017
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,312
- Sound the alert.
- But she's not a ship of war, sir.

1018
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,356
Isn't she?

1019
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,397
- Sound the alert.
- Bugler, sound the alert.

1020
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:20,317
FRANK: Rommel is here.

1021
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:23,477
And here, at a place called El Alamein,
is the 8th Army.

1022
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,476
If the Germans manage to advance now,

1023
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,353
Rommel will be able to pierce
our main defence line

1024
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,431
before the 8th Army's had
time to consolidate.

1025
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:34,314
In other words, he'll grab the initiative
before they're ready to hit back.

1026
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:39,354
Right. Ourjob's simple. To slow down
and stop Rommel by cutting off his supplies.

1027
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,578
That's why you gentlemen
with Wellingtons and Beauforts

1028
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:45,614
have been sent to us from the Middle
East. If his convoys come this way,

1029
01:22:45,684 --> 01:22:47,471
they' ll run into the Middle East
Air Force and the Fleet,

1030
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,398
so they'll almost certainly
come straight down here.

1031
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:54,319
Well, as you can see, Malta is an
ideal position as a base for attack.

1032
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:58,312
We've begun well.
Two ships sunk out of a convoy of four.

1033
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:00,271
But that is only a beginning.

1034
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,951
From now until the Afrika Korps
is bogged down,

1035
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:07,318
you're going to keep at it day and night.
This is an all-out offensive operation.

1036
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:10,432
The restrictions on the use of petrol
and ammunition are off,

1037
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:13,313
and so is the ban on talking
to base from the air.

1038
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:16,816
These convoys have got to be found,
and if you run into trouble

1039
01:23:16,887 --> 01:23:19,393
with enemy fighters through
talking to base in finding them,

1040
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:23,399
then you'll just have to run into it
and get out of it the best way you can.

1041
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,476
Now a lot of you have
been used to taking it.

1042
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,476
We're now going to dish it out.

1043
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:33,310
We're going to crack Rommel on the nose,
even if we bark our knuckles a bit doing it.

1044
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,396
Have you anything to add
to that, Admiral?

1045
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:41,395
Only that now we've got submarines based
at Malta again, we'll play in this band too.

1046
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:04,392
Big show this time, Peter. Big tanker,
two supply ships and five escorts.

1047
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,358
- Right, I'll watch them.
- I could sleep for a week.

1048
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:57,509
Stand by.

1049
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:03,355
Fire one.

1050
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,515
One fired, sir.

1051
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:19,278
- Where to, skipper?
- The Eyetie battle fleet.

1052
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:22,312
Peter Ross spotted them this morning,
between Sicily and Sardinia.

1053
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:25,432
(Low whistle) What do we get
for a battleship? A case of Scotch?

1054
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,689
I'm afraid I'll be a bit out of
touch after all this...

1055
01:25:57,728 --> 01:26:00,499
but I think I can get a readership
in archaeology.

1056
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:03,478
I was practically promised it
just before the war began.

1057
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,514
Then we could go and
live in Cambridge.

1058
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,357
Cambridge?

1059
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:12,278
- What is it like, Cambridge?
- Very beautiful.

1060
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,356
Much more beautiful than Oxford.

1061
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,436
You'd have to give tea parties.

1062
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:22,313
- Why?
- One does in Cambridge.

1063
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,509
Oh.

1064
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,276
Perhaps we'd both hate it.

1065
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:30,312
I'd rather do field work really.
Could you bear it?

1066
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:33,470
Living in Mesopotamia or
Jutland or Palestine...

1067
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:37,276
..or wherever my work took me.

1068
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,476
It'll be a free world.

1069
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,476
We'll see a lot of it.

1070
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:49,313
That's all I can offer you, really.
To see our world and explore its past.

1071
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,396
And children, of course.

1072
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,476
Our children? Or just children?

1073
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,476
Our children.

1074
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,476
How many shall we have?

1075
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:09,273
I would like six. But one must, of course,
wait and see what God sends.

1076
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,476
Six?

1077
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:14,398
I'm not sure that we shall be
able to afford six.

1078
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:17,474
Not unless I get a chair.

1079
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,469
A chair?

1080
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,478
- Being made professor is called
getting a chair. - Oh.

1081
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,396
Professor.

1082
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:29,432
Professor. Professor Ross.

1083
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,276
No contact, sir.

1084
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:56,278
- We've lost them. - Probably doubled
back in the night. - The biggest convoy...

1085
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:00,389
they've tried. Everything set up and
we have to have this filthy weather.

1086
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:05,438
I don't think it's any good stooging around
in this, Peter. Just a waste of petrol.

1087
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:08,517
If they doubled back,
they might be anywhere in the Mediterranean.

1088
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:12,312
Hm. Does that mean that I can reckon
to be free for an hour?

1089
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,430
No. You'd better stand by
in case it clears.

1090
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,476
You can see her this evening.

1091
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,271
All right.

1092
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:25,276
Let me know the moment it's at all possible.

1093
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,390
The weather can change pretty quickly
in these parts.

1094
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:30,332
- The Met report says we should
have sunshine. - I dare say,

1095
01:28:30,333 --> 01:28:32,033
but that's three hours wasted.

1096
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:35,278
If we don't find them today, we
won't find them until tomorrow.

1097
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:37,436
And after that it'll be the
very devil to get at them.

1098
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,391
I'm going down to the
airfield to have a look.

1099
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,471
Afternoon, Bartlett. Afternoon, Matthews.

1100
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,353
Afternoon, sir. I think it'll
clear up a bit, sir.

1101
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,278
- You've got someone standing by?
- Yes, sir. Peter Ross.

1102
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,311
He might get off. It's still
a bit thick but...

1103
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:00,318
- Go and find him, will you?
I'd like a word. - Yes, sir.

1104
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,396
We've got to get you on to these people
before dark.

1105
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:05,472
- So make sure you're absolutely
ready to go. - Very good, sir.

1106
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:19,273
- Afternoon, Ross.
- Afternoon, sir.

1107
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:22,517
You've seen this convoy. It's the
biggest yet and it's got to be found.

1108
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,389
Go and find it.

1109
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,397
- And ifyou can't see it, find it by smell.
- Yes, sir.

1110
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:31,512
It's still pretty thick here,
but it may be better further out.

1111
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,515
We shall only just get on to them
before dusk anyway,

1112
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:38,517
so if you pick them up
you will radio their position.

1113
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:41,474
Don't talk until you've found them.

1114
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,436
And when you do, give it to us at once.

1115
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:48,473
Does that apply to wherever they
are, sir? - It applies wherever they are.

1116
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,356
Do you understand, Ross?

1117
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,514
Yes, sir.

1118
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,474
Then get going and quick.

1119
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:34,272
MAN: I'll send a report as
soon as we get anything.

1120
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:38,511
Yes. Something might be coming up.
No, no activity over this side.

1121
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:47,316
He's got long-range tanks on,

1122
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:51,352
but even so, he's got about one more hour
before he'll have to pack it in.

1123
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,356
- Nothing from Ross yet?
- No, sir.

1124
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:55,396
Where is he? Is he still on the plot?

1125
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:01,318
Well, I don't see why
he's messing about down there.

1126
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:04,272
They're almost certain to be
steering due east now.

1127
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:24,512
Hello, Striker. Hello, Striker.
This is Picture One.

1128
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:27,318
- Here he is, sir.
- Put him on the speaker.

1129
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,318
PETER:
Enemy destroyer travelling at full speed.

1130
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:33,397
May have made a depth-charge attack
and now regaining convoy.

1131
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:36,398
Am shadowing. Bright sunshine here.

1132
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:38,396
Out.

1133
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:02,352
He' ll have to be mighty quick
if he's going to find them, sir.

1134
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:06,274
He's blown the gaff about his position.
They'll be on to him in a few minutes.

1135
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:09,357
- They've probably got
fighters in the air now. - Mm.

1136
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:13,319
PETER: Tally-ho.
Convoy sighted about ten miles ahead.

1137
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,432
Can't quite see yet,
but I make it one big tanker...

1138
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:20,396
..three other big ships...

1139
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:22,396
and four destroyers.

1140
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,353
Sir, six enemy aircraft approaching.

1141
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:29,356
Damn, that was quick work.

1142
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:32,398
Tip him off about this.
Tell him to get his picture and get out.

1143
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:34,510
Give the bombers a position and get 'em off.

1144
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,356
Hello, Picture One. Hello, Picture One.

1145
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:40,312
This is Striker. Six bandits at 20,000 feet.

1146
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:43,318
Get your picture
and then vamoose pronto. Over.

1147
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,516
Righto. Going in for picture now.

1148
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:58,397
Yes.

1149
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,358
One tanker, three biggish chaps,
four destroyers.

1150
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,436
A lot of flak coming up.

1151
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:08,314
I think one of the destroyers
is one of those new special jobs.

1152
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,316
No sign of your bandits yet.

1153
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:18,396
They're up sun to him now, sir.

1154
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,391
Tell him to break away and get out quick.

1155
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:27,399
Hello, Picture One. Break off contact
and return base. Watch them out of the sun.

1156
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,436
Message received, understood and welcomed.

1157
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:47,436
I'm breaking away now.

1158
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,476
Your little friends are with me.

1159
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,396
Ah, this is where it gets tricky.

1160
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,435
Rather uncomf...

1161
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,276
(Silence)

1162
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:33,514
(Soft crackling)

1163
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,316
(Plane screeches)

1164
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:24,352
Hello, Picture One. Hello, Picture One.

1165
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:26,396
Are you receiving? Over.

1166
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,276
It may only be his transmitter, sir.

1167
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,516
- Are the bombers off yet?
- Taking off now, sir.

1168
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,429
Good.

1169
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:45,436
They'll just make it before dark.

1170
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:01,271
Hello, Picture One.

1171
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:03,356
Are you receiving? Over.

1172
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,471
- The Wimpeys are over them now, sir.
- Good.

1173
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:48,474
(Heavy gunfire)

1174
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,391
(Bomb whistles)

1175
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,431
(Newspaper seller shouts)

1176
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:41,429
Extra!

1177
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:43,391
Extra! Extra!

1178
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:55,276
(Wild cheering)

1179
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,317

(Distant bell tolls)

1181
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,437
GOVERNOR: We have seen hardship
and we have seen triumph.

1182
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:28,278
We shall see more of both.

1183
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:33,348
If history remembers us,
let it say that we stood fast in faith,

1184
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:36,432
giving freely what little we had
and what little we were.

1185
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:42,395
Never doubting that we spent
ourselves for the general good.
