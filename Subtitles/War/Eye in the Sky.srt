347
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,556
Fuck. Fuck.
Matt, what's happening?

348
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,108
We're seeing suicide vests and a
whole bunch of fucking explosives

349
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,758
<i>inside that house.</i>

350
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,192
Well, this changes things.

351
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,153
All right. Keep it calm,
okay? Don't wind up my pilot.

GLEESON: Yes, ma'am.

354
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,039
They're gonna
make a suicide video.

355
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,039
Who is that, Colonel?

356
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,479
Looks like Osman Abade.

357
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,998
He supplied the explosives
in the Lamu bombing.

(PHONE RINGING)

359
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,553
GENERAL BENSON ON PHONE:
<i>What's the plan, Katherine?</i>

360
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,949
We need to put a Hellfire
through that roof right now.

361
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,508
I told you, they came to
witness a capture, not a kill.

362
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,715
Give me a capture option.

363
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
COLONEL POWELL: <i>We no longer
have a capture option.</i>

364
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,958
Any action on the ground will
lead to an armed confrontation,

365
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,393
which we will not
be able to contain.

366
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,072
They're watching.

367
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,152
Even with the vests,
we need their approval for a strike.

368
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,040
Just tell them we've got
Danford in our sights.

369
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,674
I mean, that alone should
justify using a Hellfire.

370
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,840
The vests are just a bonus.

371
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,354
Danford's a British citizen.
They want her alive.

372
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,112
They cannot have her alive!

373
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,719
Frank, I've tracked
her for six years.

374
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,756
This is the closest
I've ever got.

375
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,993
So, we need to expand our
rules of engagement right now

376
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,672
to protect the
civilian population.

377
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,318
A Hellfire through
that roof is our

378
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,879
<i>most effective option.</i>

379
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,195
We have to know that we're
legally in the clear.

380
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,829
Yes. Yes, of course.
I'm getting into that right now.

381
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,958
(BOTH SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

Oh, Harold, you've been following?
Yes, ma'am.

384
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,435
So, the plan is
to put a Hellfire

385
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,675
through the roof
of that house.

386
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,591
I need legal
clearance right now.

387
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,517
A missile from the Reaper?
Yes.

388
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,397
So, this is no longer
a capture situation.

389
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,598
No. We have two suicide vests with
explosives inside that house.

390
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,319
So, can you clear
me to a higher CDE?

391
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,480
HAROLD: Uh...

392
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,236
Harold, this is a very time-sensitive target.
Do I have authority to strike?

393
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,992
The rules of engagement
you're operating under

394
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,960
only allow for a low
collateral damage estimate.

395
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,508
Yes, yes, and my weapons
only invoke a low CDE.

396
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,511
It's the explosives
inside that house

397
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,591
that bring it to
a potentially high CDE.

398
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,272
And since you know
the explosives are there,

399
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,555
it is incumbent upon you
to take them into account.

400
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,074
I can see a potential
legal objection.

401
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,151
Jesus! We've got two
suicide bombers

402
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,033
and three very high value
individuals inside that house!

403
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,712
And you want them off your
list, I understand that.

404
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,677
But the rules of engagement
you're operating under

405
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,320
envisaged a capture,
not a kill scenario.

406
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,515
Ma'am, I think it
would be wise to refer up.

407
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,594
Are you telling me that,
or just debating with me?

408
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
To refer up?

409
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,680
Mmm-hmm.

410
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,313

COLONEL POWELL: <i>Sir.</i>

413
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,516
Legal has advised me to refer
up to the Attorney General.

414
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,200
I need a quick answer, Frank.

415
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,079
Okay, I'll put
that to him.

416
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,954
George.

417
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,951
Those explosives mean there
is an imminent threat

418
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,235
of serious harm to
the civilian population.

419
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,720
Can we strike?

420
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,475
Well, given the new
circumstances, I would say yes.

Brian.

422
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,197
There is a political as well as
a legal call to be made here.

423
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,838
Yes, I'm quite
aware of that, George.

424
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,957
We need a decision
now, Minister.

425
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,833
Legally, we don't
have a problem?

426
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,955
No, we don't.

427
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,075
But politically...

428
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,440
Do we have
permission to proceed?

429
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
Well,

430
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,956
you seem to be implying yes, George.
Thank you.

431
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,120
Hold on a minute. Hold on.
No. That is not what I...

432
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,919
This is a change of mission from a
capture to a shoot-to-kill, isn't it?

433
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,393
Yes, it is.

434
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,840
ANGELA: Are we
all right with that?

435
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,315
I'm sure we are not.

436
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,233
There are two British citizens
and an American as targets.

437
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,719
This mission has
the full support

438
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,239
of Kenya and
the United States.

439
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,469
For a drone strike?

440
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,039
Yes, a missile
fired from an RPA

441
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,917
is part of
an agreed contingency plan

442
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,479
in circumstances like this.

443
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,879
Do we have
permission to proceed?

444
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,872
No. Such a plan should not
have been signed off by the PM

445
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,109
without the
authority of Parliament.

446
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,351
Operational issues are not
generally discussed at Cabinet,

447
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,680
and certainly
not at Parliament.

448
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,871
I know the protocol.
I'm talking about what should be happening.

449

Angela, in my view,
all the legal criteria

450
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,192
for an attack
have been met.

451
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,317
Namely, this is
a military necessity,

452
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,670
there is no
reasonable alternative,

453
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,309
and the force to be used is
in proportion to the threat.

454
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,719
That should
answer your question.

455
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,074
It does not, George.

456
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,431
Has there ever been a British-led
drone attack on a city

457
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,114
in a friendly country
that is not at war?

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,391
I do not believe so, no.

460
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,833
Then how can
we sanction it?

461
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,351
Generate new damage rings
for the compound

462
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,908

payload on those jackets.

Yes. Yes, it is,

we are at risk of being perceived

504

as embarking on
a shoot-to-kill policy.

505
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,713
But since all the legal
criteria are sound,

506
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,189
I believe we must allow this
military action to continue.

512

Given the situation,
that it is a change of mission,

513
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,354
that it is now a missile
attack on a British subject,

514
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,477
two British subjects,
and an American citizen,

515
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,078
and in a friendly country,

516
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,360

only right and proper

517

that I refer this up to

693
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,151

see the HVIs moving

out of the frag radius,

695
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,709

chance to get out of the way.

00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,392
Lieutenant,
you have clearance.

697
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,074
There is a lot more at stake
than you see here in this image.

698
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,674

for the CDE to be run again.

00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,674
I will not release my weapon
until that happens.

707

<i>that the existence of

<i>and you are putting

841
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,315
George, do I understand
this correctly?

842
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,436
There's a legal
argument for waiting

843
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,750
and giving this girl a
chance to sell her bread?

844
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,115
Yes, there is.

845
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,758
But, conversely,
it does not mean

846
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,632
that there is not also
a legal argument

847
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,512
for releasing the weapon now.

848
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,040
Forgive me,
I'm not sure that helps me.

849
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:54,834
Foreign Secretary, there is a
military necessity for acting now.

850
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:59,311
In our view, they'll be making a
move from that house at any moment.

851
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:04,030
Gentlemen, what action is being
legally recommended to me?

852
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:07,032
James, the legal argument
is that we could wait,

853
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,838
but we need not wait.

854
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,992
And the military argument
is that we should not wait.

855
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,433
Right?
Exactly.

856
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,310
It's my recommendation
that we should not delay

857
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,351
<i>in proceeding
with this mission.</i>

858
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,237

will suffer.

risk killing 80 others?

her and take that risk.

869

I'd rather point to Al-Shabab

872
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,712
as murderers of
80 people shopping

873
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,558

defend a drone attack

kills an innocent child.

a compelling point.

876
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,231
If Al-Shabab kill 80 people,
we win the propaganda war.

If we kill one child,
they do.
