3
00:00:03,844 --> 00:00:05,678
<i>I would give far more.</i>

4
00:00:05,746 --> 00:00:07,146
Earl Haraldson:
We will raid east again.

5
00:00:07,247 --> 00:00:09,115
Every year we go
to the same places,

6
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:10,550
but there is an alternative.

7
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:11,951
They're my ships

8
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:13,186
and they go where
I tell them to go.

9
00:00:13,287 --> 00:00:15,254
That's the end of the matter.

<i>Ragnar: We should sail west.</i>

11
00:00:16,924 --> 00:00:18,324
Can't sail across
an open ocean.

12
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:21,194
I have something
that will change everything.

13
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:22,628
Earl Haraldson:
You keep talking about the west.

14
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:24,030
I believe...

I don't care what you believe.

16
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:28,820
Don't ever stick your nose
in my face again.

17
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:30,903
Floki: The boat will be lighter
and faster than before.

18
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:32,705
Do you think it could handle
long sea voyages?

19
00:00:32,806 --> 00:00:34,440
We won't know
that until we try.

20
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,008
We must find a crew.

21
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:37,910
Not many men will go against

welcome to my house.

40

You also, rollo.

41
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:09,435
<i>I've done as you asked, Ragnar,</i>

42
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:12,471
and sought out these young men
<i>to meet you.</i>

43
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:15,241
All of them have sworn
upon their rings

44
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:18,077
to keep this meeting a secret.

45
00:02:18,178 --> 00:02:20,880
You have done well, my friend,

46
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:22,815
although I knew
I could trust you.

47
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,817
Leif: What are we here for?

48
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:27,119
You are here, firstly,

49
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,888
because you have
nothing better to do.

50
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:31,157
(Laughing and protesting)

51
00:02:31,258 --> 00:02:34,126
Ragnar: See, all you lot
live idle and wasted lives.

52
00:02:34,227 --> 00:02:35,494
(Young men protest, upset)

53
00:02:35,562 --> 00:02:36,762
Listen to him!

54
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,698
(Everyone quiets down)

55
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:41,600
We have built a new boat.

56
00:02:41,668 --> 00:02:44,637
And with this boat,
for the first time,

57
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:45,905
we can go west.

58
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:48,541
(Men scoff, chuckle)

59
00:02:48,642 --> 00:02:51,110
Ragnar: Across the great sea,
to a place called England,

60
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:53,446
where countless riches await us.

61
00:02:53,547 --> 00:02:55,548
<i>Torstein: How would we

62
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:56,615

63
00:02:58,952 --> 00:02:59,852
We have discovered a way.

Kauko: You want us to
join you in the boat?

<i>Rollo: Yes, we do.</i>

66
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:09,128
And I have Ragnar's word
that we will all be equal

67
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:10,863
and share equally
the spoils of our raid.

68

70

What is your name?

71
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:20,973
Knut.

72
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:23,009
I promise you, Knut,

73
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:24,477
I've heard witnesses.

74
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:26,412
Just stories.

75
00:03:26,513 --> 00:03:28,247
Just stories...
(Chuckles softly)

76
00:03:29,716 --> 00:03:30,883
<i>Just stories.</i>

77
00:03:34,955 --> 00:03:38,157
All things begin and end
as stories.

78
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:40,326
Erik:
We have to remember, though,

79
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:44,363
that Earl Haraldson
has ordered us to sail east.

80
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:47,233
The Earl knows nothing about
our new boat.

81
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:49,468
He knows nothing about
the new way of navigating.

82
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:52,905
This is why he refuses
to let us go west.

83
00:03:52,973 --> 00:03:54,573
Leif: He could kill us for
disobeying his orders.

84
00:03:54,574 --> 00:03:56,442
(Murmurs of agreement)
Yes, he could.

85
00:03:59,513 --> 00:04:01,914
We can offer you a chance
to shine in battle

86
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:04,483
<i>and impress the gods,</i>

87
00:04:04,584 --> 00:04:05,818
and to bring back such plunder

88
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,421
that you have never seen before.

89
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:14,860
Have you got the balls
to join us?

90
00:04:16,763 --> 00:04:17,596
I'll go.

91
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,600
Man: And I.
Man 2: I will go.

92
00:04:21,701 --> 00:04:25,037
Young men: I too! I will too!
And I! I will go!

93
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,182
What about you, Knut?

94
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:38,551
Are you coming?

95
00:04:38,652 --> 00:04:40,019
Yes, I want a good story
to tell my children.

96
00:04:42,322 --> 00:04:43,055
Ragnar: (Happy) Ahh!

97
00:04:43,123 --> 00:04:45,057
(Men chuckle)

98
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,160
Prepare to leave
in the next few weeks,

99
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:50,830
and tell no one
that doesn't need to know.

100
00:04:54,234 --> 00:04:54,934
(Low murmurs)

101
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,070

<i>Siggy: (Laughs)</i>

103
00:05:07,314 --> 00:05:08,547
Earl Haraldson: Well?

104
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:11,083
<i>Olafur:</i>
<i>My lord, there was a meeting.</i>

105
00:05:11,184 --> 00:05:12,284
Earl Haraldson: Where?

106
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:14,120
In the house of Erik Marteinn.

107
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:18,390
Was Ragnar Lothbrok there?

108
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,559
Yes, lord.

109
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,398
Shall we show them the axe?

110
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:29,435
Nothing would please me more,
but it's too soon.

111
00:05:31,104 --> 00:05:32,538
We need to watch and wait.

112
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,276
Siggy: Only good things
come from watching...

113
00:05:37,377 --> 00:05:38,010
And waiting.

114
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:01,901
(Quietly)
Were you looking at my wife?

115
00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:04,937
Have you slept with her?

116
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:06,305
No, lord!

117
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:08,841
I swear on all the gods.

118
00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:15,314
If she wants to sleep with you,

119
00:06:15,382 --> 00:06:17,082
then I give my permission.

120
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,720
It will be arranged.

121
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,623
(Hooves thud)

122
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:30,896
(Birds cry overhead)

123
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:43,742

124
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:49,548
<i>Lagertha: So when do we sail?</i>

125
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:51,550
Ragnar: I already told you.

126
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:53,252
I don't want you to come.

127
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:54,053
Why not?

128
00:06:56,156 --> 00:07:00,192
Ragnar: I need to leave the children and
the farm in the hands of someone I trust.

129
00:07:00,293 --> 00:07:03,362
What if the Earl finds out we
have gone without his permission?

130
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:07,199
He might try and claim
our family home.

131
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,801
This was going to be
the most exciting voyage

132
00:07:08,868 --> 00:07:10,636
of our lives.

133
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:11,870
(Ragnar continues
washing clothes)

134
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:12,605
To go west!

135
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:22,381
I have dreamed of it
many times,

136
00:07:22,482 --> 00:07:25,417
and in my dreams
we are always together.

137
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:30,389
What if there is no west?

138
00:07:32,926 --> 00:07:36,495
This is the most dangerous
and stupid voyage ever.

139
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:41,166
What if we both die, hmm?

140
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:44,003
Then who would take care
of the children...

141
00:07:46,306 --> 00:07:47,006
rollo?!

142
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:50,576
You have no right to say that!

143
00:07:58,218 --> 00:07:59,852
All right, all right. You go.

144
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:05,924
<i>You go</i>

145
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:09,595
and I shall stay here
and look after the children.

146
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:10,996
(Water churns as he continues
scrubbing clothes)

147
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:16,001
Olafur: (Whispering) Siggy?

148
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:16,769
Go away!

149
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:24,376
It's so cold in here,

150
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:27,846
but we'll be warm soon enough.

151
00:08:31,217 --> 00:08:32,718

(Furious grunts

154
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:42,895
What do you take me for?

155
00:08:42,996 --> 00:08:44,496
Did you really suppose
that a worm like you

156
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:46,065
could sleep with a woman
like me?

157
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:46,899
I'm an Earl's wife!

158
00:08:48,401 --> 00:08:49,335
(Panting breaths)

<i>Earl Haraldson:</i>
<i>Now I know who to trust</i>

160
00:09:00,347 --> 00:09:01,613

00:09:04,984 --> 00:09:06,852
(Defeated sigh)

- You listen.
- Ungh!

I saved your life.

Are you mad?

200
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:16,448
You could have killed
each other!

201
00:11:16,516 --> 00:11:17,983
Is that what you want?

202
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:19,551
Ragnar: We were just
having an argument.

203
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:22,154
Well, never argue
like that again.

204
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:23,355
Go on then!

205
00:11:23,423 --> 00:11:24,089

212

Olafur surprised me.

213
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,426
I didn't think, out of all of
them, he would behave like that.

214
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:05,430
A man lives or dies
by his honor.

215

<i>Siggy: That's true.</i>

216
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,967
He thought so little of mine

217
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:12,804
that he really believed
that I would give you to him.

218
00:12:12,872 --> 00:12:14,506
(Laughs)

219
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:16,675
Honor is a rare commodity
these days.

220
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:18,911
Yes.

221
00:12:19,012 --> 00:12:22,514
Almost as rare as those
in whom I can trust.

222
00:12:23,106 --> 00:12:24,476
It's true, my love,

223
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,745
our enemies are everywhere.

224
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:30,291
Everywhere?

225
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,593
They cannot prevail.

226

Where is my anchor?

233
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,148
It was promised for today.

234
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:23,350
Maybe your blacksmith
is a liar.

235
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:24,818
Floki: I don't think so.

236
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,623
This hair is from
his daughter's head.

237
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:31,025
I promised him

238
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:32,960
that if he went
to Earl Haraldson

239
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:35,196
I would find a way to kill her.

240
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:36,163

Ragnar: I still don't see Knut.

242
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:48,609
Well, that's because
he isn't here.

243
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,811
He hasn't sent word either.

244
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:56,016
That troubles me.

245
00:13:56,117 --> 00:13:57,484
We live in a sea of troubles.

246
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:01,989

365
00:23:30,908 --> 00:23:31,775
<i>Not be happy?!</i>

366
00:23:33,377 --> 00:23:34,778
Ragnar: Floki, sit down.

367
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:39,215
Remember, you can't swim!

368
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:40,717
(Laughing hysterically)

369
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,897
(Lightning fizzes, crackles,
and rips across the dark sky)

(Speaking ancient anglo Saxon)

371

the corridor)

374

Athelstan: Father Cuthbert!

375
00:24:39,443 --> 00:24:42,111
What is it, brother Athelstan?

376
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:44,113
We can all see the signs.

377
00:24:44,215 --> 00:24:46,082
Father Cuthbert: Signs? What signs?
Of what do you speak?

378
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:47,483
You know as well as we

379
00:24:47,585 --> 00:24:49,686
that judgment day is at hand.

380
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:51,521
Jeremiah says so!

381
00:24:51,622 --> 00:24:53,623
"And on that day,
the sun shall be darkened,"

382
00:24:53,724 --> 00:24:55,291
and the moon shall
not give her light,

383
00:24:55,392 --> 00:24:56,960
"and the stars of heaven
shall fall."

384
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:58,695
In the name of God,
that is enough.

385
00:24:58,796 --> 00:25:01,164
But it's true!

386
00:25:01,265 --> 00:25:03,299
"And I stood upon
the sand of the sea,"

387
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,335
and saw a beast rise up
out of the sea,

388
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:07,570
"having seven heads
and ten horns."

389
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:09,072
Father Cuthbert:
(Firmly) I will hear no more!

390
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:11,374
<i>You will return</i>
<i>to your dormitory</i>

391

and humility...

392
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:15,345
And when the storm has passed

393
00:25:15,446 --> 00:25:17,480
all shall be well.

394
00:25:17,581 --> 00:25:18,948
You will do as I order.

395
00:25:22,887 --> 00:25:24,020
Yes, father.

Blacksmith's daughter: Father!

398
00:25:50,114 --> 00:25:51,614
Good day to you, blacksmith.

399

(Steam hisses)

400

Blacksmith: My lord, how
can I be of use to you?

401
00:26:00,491 --> 00:26:01,257
You make anchors, don't you?

402
00:26:02,993 --> 00:26:05,094
Yes, lord.

403
00:26:05,195 --> 00:26:06,796
Have you made any recently?

404
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:14,003
No, not recently,
lord Haraldson.

405
00:26:14,104 --> 00:26:15,271
<i>Svein:</i>

407

I would have remembered.

408

Don't hurt my daughter.

409
00:26:27,151 --> 00:26:30,386
Why would I hurt your daughter?

410

<i>His lordship just wants</i>
<i>to know the truth.</i>

411

Did you forge the anchor
for Ragnar Lothbrok's ship?

412
00:26:44,034 --> 00:26:45,335
Yes, I forged it.

413
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:47,971
Let go of her.

414
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,376
Put down your hammer.

415
00:26:53,477 --> 00:26:55,979
I promise you no harm
will come to your daughter.

416
00:27:08,392 --> 00:27:09,492
Look in the flames.

417

What do you see?

423
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:38,354
I see my own death.

There is no west!

433

(Shaky breath,
grunts with effort)

434
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:42,652
We are not sailing towards
any new country

435
00:28:42,753 --> 00:28:44,454
but just into an empty ocean...

436
00:28:49,426 --> 00:28:51,127
Utterly and completely lost.

<i>Kauko, leif...</i>

<i>That scoundrel, that sly one.</i>

Shut up, man!

443

Warrior: No!

No.

445

If anyone is mad, it is you.

446

I'm not the one who convinced

<i>an illusion.</i>

449

It wasn't me who joined forces

Sit down and shut up.

You sound like the sly one.

For this ship is cursed,

466

(Wings flap loudly
in the silence)

469

If the birds do not return,
there is land.

They've come back.

473

00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:39,332
Ugh!

546
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:41,834
(Rollo coughs at the stench)

547
00:36:41,935 --> 00:36:43,102
(Rollo gags, disgusted)

548
00:36:45,706 --> 00:36:47,106
(Monk screams, terrified)

549
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:51,577
(Rollo gags, disgusted)

550
00:36:52,946 --> 00:36:53,579
Ungh! Ungh!

551
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,684
(Door creaks open,
footsteps scuff across floor)

552
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:15,935
<i>Leif: I don't understand.</i>

553
00:37:16,036 --> 00:37:18,871
Why do they leave such
treasures unprotected?

554
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:22,208
Is there some spell,
some magic which protects them?

555
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:24,944
Erik: It appears not.

556
00:37:25,045 --> 00:37:26,779
(They laugh)

557
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,750
<i>Ragnar: Perhaps they think
their God protects them.</i>

558
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:33,519
If this is their God,
then he's dead.

559
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,588
<i>He is nailed to a cross.</i>

560
00:37:35,689 --> 00:37:36,989
<i>Leif: He cannot protect anyone.</i>

561
00:37:37,091 --> 00:37:39,926
He is not alive, like Odin,
Thor or Frey.

562
00:37:40,027 --> 00:37:41,327
What use is he then?

563
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:42,628
(Leif and Erik laugh)

564
00:37:44,364 --> 00:37:45,164
(Clank nearby)

565
00:37:53,006 --> 00:37:54,006
(Frightened gasps)

566
00:37:56,844 --> 00:37:58,945
Athelstan: (ln old
Norse) Don't kill me.

567
00:38:00,747 --> 00:38:02,747
<i>Ragnar: You speak our language.</i>

568
00:38:04,084 --> 00:38:05,351
(Gasps, frightened)

569
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:07,086
Ragnar: How do you
speak our language?

570
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:09,489
I've travelled.

571
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:12,091
We are told to travel,
to take the word of God.

572
00:38:12,192 --> 00:38:15,385
Please, don't kill me.

573
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,641
<i>Ragnar: What is that
you have in your hand?</i>

574
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,977
(Shakily) A book...

575
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,780
The gospels of st John,
I... I wanted to save it.

576
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,081
(Flips through pages)

577
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,421
(Snaps book shut)

578
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:46,505
<i>Ragnar: Of all the treasures
I see in this place,</i>

579
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,629
you chose to save this?

580
00:38:50,776 --> 00:38:51,408
Yes.

581
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:55,646
Hmm. Why?

582
00:39:02,095 --> 00:39:03,142
Why?

583
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,744
Because without the word of God

584
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:09,713
there is only darkness.

585
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:23,138
Rollo:
This is a strange place indeed.

586
00:39:25,231 --> 00:39:27,974
We have been everywhere
and we have found no women.

587
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,102
Just these strange men.

588
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,405
Ragnar: I believe they are
the priests of their God.

589
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,940
<i>Rollo: Take what you will.</i>

590
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,243
This is what we came for.

591
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,980
Why have you not killed
this one?

592
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,249
He is worth more alive...

593
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,817
to sell as a slave.

594
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:49,419
I would kill him.

595
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,855
We have no room left
on the boat.

596
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,491
Ragnar: I forbid it.

597
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,026
Rollo: How can you forbid
it, little brother?

598
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,762
We are all equals,

599
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,284
and I say he dies.

600
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,571
Does it really mean
that much to you, brother?

601
00:40:20,598 --> 00:40:22,176
(Hard smash)

602
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,857
This is what we care
for your God.

603
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,159
(Shaky breathing)

604
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:07,997

testing it)

<i>Man: So much gold!</i>

609
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:07,390
Look!

610
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,793
Ragnar: Keep them moving!

611
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:14,263
Ugh!
