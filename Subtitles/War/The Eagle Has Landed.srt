1
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,235
It is the opportunity
of a lifetime, Admiral Canaris.

2
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,630
A wonderful chance to show
what the Abwehr is capable of.

3
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,870
Wouldn't you agree,
Reichsführer Himmler?

4
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,318
After the miracle you have effected
in rescuing II Duce, anything is possible.

5
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,278
Our own glorious
Sturmbannführer Skorzeny

6
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,033
merely shares your instinct for daring.

7
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,875
We cannot expect less from section
three of our beloved Abwehr. We will not.

8
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,797
Well, our Führer was in rare form today,
I must say.

9
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,110
Do you really think so?

10
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,318
I, for one, thought his proposition
to you rather challenging.

11
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,878
So is harpooning a whale
with a sewing needle.

12
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,035
May I remind you that only yesterday

13
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,351
Il Duce was surrounded
by his own troops on Gran Sasso -

14
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,591
a virtual prisoner -
and today he is our honored guest.

15
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,831
Oh, yes, a daring raid
faultlessly executed.

16
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,230
Congratulate your Sturmbannführer,
Skorzeny.

17
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,313
Coming from another man of daring,
such as yourself, Herr Admiral,

18
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,872
- I'm sure it will be doubly appreciated.
- This, erm... new plan of our Führer's.

19
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,077
This... This pipe dream.

20
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,750
It is exactly that, you know.

21
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,834
I would have thought a feasibility study
at the very least was in order.

22
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,070
Surely the Abwehr can handle that?

23
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,355
If it had been proposed to your SS...

24
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,716
The SS was created to lead, Herr Admiral,

25
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,268
to be the very soul
and conscience of the Reich.

26
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,397
And since national victory
is now inevitable,

27
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,634
I would advise us all to look
to our own... personal victory as well.

28
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,996
Heil Hitler.

29
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,989
- Morning.
- Good morning, Herr Admiral.

30
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,995
Oberst Radl - send him to me at once.

31
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,435
I've notified Oberst Radl of your arrival.

32
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,476
Thank you.

33
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,875
Come in, Radl.

34
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,077
- Herr Admiral.
- Come and sit down.

35
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,071
Your meeting went well? The Führer
had something specific in mind?

36
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,112
A simple exercise in logistics.

37
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,272
Nothing very complicated.

38
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,959
He merely wants Winston Churchill
brought from London to Berlin.

39
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,598
And we are ordered
to make a feasibility study.

40
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,551
Today is Wednesday.
By Friday, he will forget it.

41
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,200
But Himmler will not.

42
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,953
Reichsführer Himmler approved?

43
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,873
Only of my being put on the spot.

44
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,554
That meeting!
You should have seen it, Radl.

45
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,428
There was Hitler -
first ranting, then cajoling.

46
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,954
And then perfectly rational.

47
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,110
Then raging and stamping like a...

48
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,634
Like the ringmaster of some freak circus.

49
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,669
Goebbels, hopping from one foot
to another like a... like a schoolboy.

50
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,469
Bormann - a vulture...

51
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,714
perched in the corner -
watching, listening, never speaking.

52
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,189
And Mussolini... Mussolini!

53
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,639
An automaton, Radl.

54
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,871
And I looked round that room,
and I wondered...

55
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,996
am I the only one who can see it?

56
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,914
And if so, what must I look like to them?

57
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,394
Herr Admiral, the feasibility study...

58
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,393
Will be a total
and unnecessary waste of time.

59
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,512
Make it immediately.

60
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,036
Why not put a bullet through your head,
it's quicker.

61
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,350
And others need the brandy.

62
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,153
You had an appointment
for an examination this morning at ten.

63
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,199
You had another two weeks ago
and another two weeks before that.

64
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,068
The Admiral and I were discussing
a special project for our Führer.

65
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,948
In spite of your skills as a doctor,

66
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,909
I believe my health was better
served by keeping that appointment.

67
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,279
You didn't chain-smoke to remind me
what a stubborn ass you are, Max.

68
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,512
You'll be flicking your own ashes
on my grave soon enough.

69
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,637
Not if you stop
this idiotic self-destruction.

70
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,837
And die in May as opposed to October?

71
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,312
If I am to die, let me die in peace, hm?

72
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,470
Heil Hitler.

73
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,508
Complete for the last month.

74
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,876
If Herr Oberst could give me
a rough idea of our problem?

75
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,110
I can be quite specific about it.

76
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,318
The Führer has instructed us
to kidnap Winston Churchill.

77
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,753
Good God!

78
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,753
Well, Karl,
do at least a feasibility study on it.

79
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,389
Something which might
fit our needs came in yesterday.

80
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,109
Just a mention,
as far as I remember. If I may, sir?

81
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,431
Here it is. From codename Starling.

82
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,676
A village in England
called Studley Constable.

83
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,158
How do we receive reports
from this Starling?

84
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,109
From the Spanish Embassy in London
by diplomatic pouch, also by radio.

85
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,113
Exactly where is Studley Constable?

86
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,512
The east coast of England.
Er... county of Norfolk.

87
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,750
Let's have a look at the place.

88
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,229
- Larger scale.
- Jawohl, Herr Oberst.

89
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,834
Ah... here.

90
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,195
Ah, Herr Oberst.

91
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,758
Isolated coastline, very rural,
wide beaches, salt marshes.

92
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,116
Ideal.

93
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,998
Now, a man to lead it, Karl.

94
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,432
Crash-landed, 1940- glider assault.

95
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,069
Albert Canal, Belgium,
dropped into Crete, '41...

96
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,516
Wounded taking Máleme airfield...
Knight's Cross.

97
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,878
Led volunteer assault group of 300,
special action, Leningrad.

98
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,794
Stalingrad Knight's Cross
with oak leaves and swords.

99
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,953
January this year, dropped into Kiev
with 167 surviving in unit,

100
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,077
to get two cut-off regiments
out of Russia.

101
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,709
- Oberst Kurt Steiner.
- And has the language?

102
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,036
Educated in England.

103
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,834
Third time in the last month,

104
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,514
despite Göring's personal guarantee.

105
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,639
Are you familiar
with the works of Jung, Karl?

106
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,315
I am aware of the works of Jung,
not familiar, Herr Oberst.

107
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,676
A very great thinker. A rational man.

108
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,549
And yet he speaks of something
called synchronicity -

109
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,870
events having a coincidence in time,

110
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,555
creating the feeling
that a deeper motivation is involved.

111
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,996
- Ja, I understand that, sir.
- Take this affair.

112
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,195
The Führer makes the absurd suggestion

113
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,352
that we emulate Skorzeny
by abducting Churchill.

114
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,989
We have to make a worthless
report on the prospects.

115
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,516
Suddenly, synchronicity
rears its disturbing head.

116
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,353
- Ja. I see that.
- We receive a routine report

117
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,230
with a brief notation that next month,
after visiting a local bomber command,

118
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,676
Churchill will spend
a weekend in a country manor

119
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,911
less than seven miles
from a deserted coastline.

120
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,117
At any other time,
this report would mean nothing.

121
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,395
At this particular time,

122
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,436
and in that particular file...

123
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,231
...it becomes a circumstance
which titillates.

124
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,073
A coincidence to... tease us.

125
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,754
Surely Herr Oberst
doesn't believe it can be carried off.

126
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,958
A wink from a pretty girl
at a party results rarely in climax...

127
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,150
but a man is a fool not to push
a suggestion as far as it will go.

128
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,759
Find this man.
He's been out of Germany too long.

129
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,155
Los, los, weiter. Schnell!

130
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,470
Los, los!

131
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,389
Hans...

132
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,436
Hans!

133
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,715
Let's stretch our legs.

134
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,436
Los, weiter!

135
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,676
Stay on the train.

136
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,149
No one allowed off the train.

137
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,835
I beg your pardon, sir.

138
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,354
Sir, you must remain on the train.

139
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,230
If memory serves me,
the Polish army surrendered in 1939.

140
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,073
- Sir?
- Who are these people?

141
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,359
- Oh, Jews, sir.
- Jews?

142
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,468
We are razing the ghetto to the ground.
Burning them out. They put up a fight.

143
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,438
Oh, how? With umbrellas and crutches?

144
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,349
Halt! Halt!

145
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,833
- I'll take the prisoner now.
- Prisoner?

146
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,674
What is...

147
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,231
- What is your name?
- Brana.

148
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,032
Good luck, Brana.

149
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,676
Identify yourself.

150
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,196
Oberst Kurt Steiner.

151
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,033
Commanding
the 12th Parachute Detachment.

152
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,514
A salute is customary
to a general, Herr Oberst.

153
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,556
Even to one of SS.

154
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,269
You didn't seem quite so
discriminating a moment ago.

155
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,750
I have nothing
for or against Jews, personally.

156
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,832
But I've seen too many
good men die for cause,

157
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,195
to watch a girl be killed for sport!

158
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,236
Straub was doing his duty...

159
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,029
He's like something I might pick
up on my shoe in the gutter -

160
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,032
very unpleasant on a hot day!

161
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,238
If you have the dubious honor
of commanding this slaughter,

162
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,437
I'd advise you to keep him
downwind at all times.

163
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,114
That is, if you can tell the difference.

164
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,668
For God's sake, Kurt.

165
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,354
What am I to do with you, Herr Oberst?

166
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,510
You're a military hero,

167
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,433
awarded the Knight's Cross for gallantry.

168
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,593
Yet responsible for the attempted escape
of an enemy of the state,

169
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,638
abetted by the mutinous conduct
of your men.

170
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,116
By rights, you should all
be court-martialled.

171
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,558
Difficult decisions are the privilege
of rank, Herr Gruppenführer.

172
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,831
But, as for my men...

173
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,232
they seem to feel a certain loyalty to me.

174
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,508
I, er...

175
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,559
don't suppose you could
content yourself with my head

176
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,632
and overlook their part in this thing?

177
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,073
Huh?

178
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,635
There you are, you see, Hans?

179
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,676
It's infallible.

180
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,309
I can always tell
a thoroughgoing bastard when I see one.

181
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,879
- Herr Oberst?
- In here, Karl.

182
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,030
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Herr Oberst.

183
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,908
The material arrived from Starling.
It is truly excellent.

184
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,956
Starling is to be commended.

185
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,753
Ja. Ja, this is good.

186
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,115
What news of Oberst Steiner?

187
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,317
We're having difficulty
tracing him, Herr Oberst.

188
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,269
He's in Germany, but as to exactly where,
we've hit a roadblock, you know?

189
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,397
Even rumors of a court martial,
but we'll find him.

190
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,358
I'm sure. And now...

191
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,432
Here... a possible undercover operative.

192
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,832
I have decided on this man.
He's lecturing here in Berlin.

193
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,672
Send for him immediately.

194
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,035
- Yes.
- Oh, and Karl.

195
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,156
Send this message to Starling.

196
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,913
Yes, Herr Oberst.

197
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,514
- Where is Herr Oberst?
- In the map room, Herr Admiral.

198
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,550
This message has been sent out.
Did you originate it?

199
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,476
I did, Herr Admiral.

200
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,836
"Very interested
in your visitor of 6th November.

201
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,948
"Would like to drop some friends in
to persuade him to come back with them.

202
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:02,989
"Your comments expected by usual
route with all relevant information."

203
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,036
You've exceeded your authority.

204
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,557
You were told to prepare this feasibility
study, not embellish a joke.

205
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,474
With your permission,
it is no longer a joke. It could be done.

206
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,676
In my opinion, it should be done.

207
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,716
What if Churchill prefers to die?

208
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,271
What if abduction
becomes assassination?

209
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,999
No one specified dead or alive.

210
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,877
God in heaven!

211
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,589
Kill Churchill
when we've already lost the war?

212
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,232
I'm sure you've done a good job,
very thorough.

213
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,030
But this operation could make
the Charge of the Light Brigade

214
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,192
look like a sensible military exercise.

215
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,516
Drop it.

216
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,670
Herr Oberst?

217
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,955
He has arrived.

218
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,359
Come in,
Colonel... Radl, isn't it?

219
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,795
The top o' the morning to you.

220
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,317
It's not Irish whiskey,
but it'll do to be going on with.

221
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,470
Better for you to drink than me.

222
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,399
I have the feeling
I might be needing it. May I?

223
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,835
Ja.

224
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,754
The last time I was invited
up here to Section Three

225
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,752
someone persuaded me
to jump out of a Dornier.

226
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,593
5,000 feet above Ireland, in the dark,

227
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,274
and me with this terrible fear of heights!

228
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,034
You're planning a holiday to England,
are you?

229
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,430
They say that Brighton's
lovely this time of year.

230
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,918
- W-What the Christ is that?
- They're Russian.

231
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,752
I took to them in the Winter War.

232
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,231
They're probably all that
kept you awake in the snow.

233
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,471
Here... and here.

234
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,712
Now...

235
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,396
- I had a proposition for you, Mr. Devlin.
- You had?

236
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,591
Have.

237
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,275
- I'm working, you know, Colonel.
- At the university.

238
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,956
For a man like you,
that's like a thoroughbred racing horse...

239
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,634
finding himself...

240
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,190
- pulling a milk cart.
- You've got a way with words, Colonel.

241
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,510
You want me to go back to Ireland?

242
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,751
Well, I can't. They'd arrest me...

243
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,434
No, no. We don't want you to go back.

244
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,559
No. You're still a supporter
of the Irish Republican Army?

245
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,189
Soldier of, Colonel. Once in, never out.

246
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,192
But you're here in Germany
and not England, why?

247
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,555
I don't like soft target hits.

248
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,631
I don't want to live in Bayswater,

249
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,393
mixing up explosives
in my landlady's saucepan

250
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,119
to blow up a couple of passers-by.

251
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,192
My fight is with
the bloody British Empire

252
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,840
and I'll fight it on my own two feet.

253
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,436
If it's some rabid fanatic you're after,
I'm the wrong man.

254
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,957
Am I right to assume your aim
is total victory against England?

255
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,830
No, that's your aim.
My aim is a united Ireland.

256
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:53,358
I appreciate the distinction
but Germany must win the war first.

257
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,796
Pigs might fly one day but I doubt it.

258
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,836
Mr. Devlin.

259
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,077
- I want you to go to England for me.
- I barely know you.

260
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,914
To assist in the kidnapping
and safe return to Germany...

261
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,309
of Winston Churchill.

262
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,910
Give me another Bolshevik
firecracker, will you?

263
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,560
I think I fell asleep in the snow.

264
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,316
Herr Oberst.

265
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,516
Good evening, Herr Oberst.

266
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,592
I am Sturmführer Toberg of the SS.

267
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,956
Reichsführer Himmler
presents his compliments

268
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,589
and requests you to bring
the plan designated "Eagle".

269
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,352
When is that to be?

270
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,749
Now, Herr Oberst.

271
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,069
You seem nervous, Herr Oberst.

272
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,440
Please relax. Sit down.

273
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,439
May I smoke, Herr Reichsführer?

274
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,272
No.

275
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,991
A masterful job.

276
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,310
Thank you, Herr Reichsführer.

277
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,791
But, you know, some people
would say that such an operation

278
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,599
could make
the Charge of the Light Brigade

279
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,797
look like a sensible military exercise.

280
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,872
Have you heard that phrase before,
Herr Oberst?

281
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,555
I don't immediately recall,
Herr Reichsführer.

282
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,835
I know all about your plan.

283
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,469
I know what is written
on every single page.

284
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,120
Even the one you haven't got yet!

285
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,990
The court martial
of Herr Oberst Steiner and his men.

286
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,955
The arrogance of this Steiner is dazzling.

287
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,629
An unusual man this... er, this Steiner.

288
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,316
Intelligent, ruthless, a brilliant soldier...

289
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,678
but above all, a romantic fool.

290
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,077
He threw away everything -

291
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,119
rank, career... the future.

292
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,233
He is presently serving
in a penal colony on the island of...

293
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,231
er... Alderney.

294
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,993
All because
of some little Jewess

295
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,038
whom he'd never
clapped eyes on before!

296
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,588
You know he's a veteran of
five successful commando raids?

297
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,193
Six, I believe.

298
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,236
Educated in England.

299
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,995
Speaks the language perfectly,
without an accent.

300
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,799
The ideal man for the job,
eh, Herr Oberst?

301
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,839
- If you think so, Herr Reichsführer.
- And so do you.

302
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,151
But the Herr Admiral Canaris
doesn't think so.

303
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,390
My loyalty to Herr Admiral...

304
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,157
Is exceeded only by your loyalty
to the Führer himself. Isn't that so?

305
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,396
I was sure of it.

306
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,676
Now, this Churchill business...

307
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,151
Our Führer wants it seen through.

308
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,597
You have considerable autonomy
in running your office.

309
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,069
You ought to be able to use it

310
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,199
as an excuse to prevent Canaris
from knowing what's going on.

311
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,035
What kind of authority would I have

312
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,669
to carry such a project through,
Herr Reichsführer?

313
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,790
Aloud, if you please.

314
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,717
"Herr Oberst Radl is acting
under my personal orders

315
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,679
"in a matter of the utmost
importance to the Reich.

316
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,069
"All personnel, military and civil,

317
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,914
"without distinction of rank,
will assist him in any way

318
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,549
"that Oberst Radl sees fit to demand.

319
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,596
"Adolf Hitler."

320
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,229
So you see, Radl,

321
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,795
under the terms of that document,

322
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,749
even I find myself
under your personal command.

323
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,156
Good luck.

324
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,710
I can only envy your inevitable
success in the matter.

325
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,439
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

326
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,791
Major Neuhoff, Commandant
of the island of Alderney.

327
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,634
- A distinct pleasure, Herr Oberst.
- Read this, please.

328
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,828
I see, Herr Oberst. What is your wish?

329
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,990
Terminate the penal unit here.

330
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,675
That applies to Steiner,
von Neustadt and the 29 men.

331
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,513
18, Herr Oberst. There are only 18 now.

332
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,589
The men are required to ride the
larger torpedo craft into enemy shipping.

333
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,240
- The torpedoes detach, of course?
- Of course.

334
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,709
- Most of the time.
- Burial detail,

335
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,555
the usual letters of commendation.
And get the names right this time.

336
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,949
- Thank you, Herr Major.
- But...

337
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,996
Thank you, Herr Major.

338
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,392
- Herr Steiner?
- Yes, I'm Steiner. What is it?

339
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,436
My name is Radl.

340
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,508
Well, what is it? I have two men to bury
and no office to make small talk in.

341
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,109
Your credentials are hopelessly
impeccable, Herr Oberst.

342
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,069
What can I do for you?

343
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,709
Lead a raiding party to England
to kidnap Winston Churchill.

344
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,718
You don't seem impressed.

345
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,995
I haven't seen your plan yet.

346
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,832
Here.

347
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,956
While he's making his decision,

348
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,952
I'll go to that pub and think about mine.

349
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,397
The only time this plan makes
any sense to me is when I'm drunk.

350
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,433
- You are in command here?
- Oberleutnant Koenig, Herr Oberst.

351
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,354
These configurations
seem somewhat abnormal for an E-boat.

352
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,035
That's because she's a converted
British MTB, Herr Oberst.

353
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,395
Captured making a drop
off the Dutch coast.

354
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,436
- Morning.
- Sir.

355
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,912
You're familiar
with the east coast of England?

356
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,120
For five years I was First Mate
on a cargo ship out of England.

357
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,872
This could work, you know?

358
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,475
It will. It is a direct order
from the Führer himself.

359
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,833
I stood opposite Adolf once.

360
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,672
When he gave me this.

361
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,275
Oh, I forgot. One of those.

362
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,148
You're an officer.
You swore an oath, you have no choice.

363
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,356
Of course I do.

364
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,637
I'm going to die here anyway... eventually.

365
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,157
You forget, Radl, that I'm under
suspended sentence of death.

366
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,673
Officially disgraced.

367
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,075
I do not retain my rank...

368
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,558
only my authority, because of the, er...

369
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,915
peculiar circumstances of this job.

370
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,958
I offer you a chance
for reinstatement of rank

371
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,554
and vindication for you and your men.

372
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,470
My men need no vindication.

373
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,270
- You said it could be done.
- It's possible.

374
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,316
Of all the world's leaders,

375
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,392
Churchill is probably the least protected,

376
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,833
unlike the Führer.

377
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,196
Steiner, is thumbing
your nose at the Führer

378
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,909
more important to you
than the lives of your men?

379
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,150
31 of you a few weeks ago.

380
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,476
How many are left?

381
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,950
Sixteen.

382
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,395
You owe them this last chance to live.

383
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,392
Or to die in England instead.

384
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,714
I will put it to my men.

385
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,995
They are entitled to know.

386
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:19,311
Only the destination for now - revealing
the target would be going too far.

387
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,312
I will put it to my men.

388
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,119
Steiner.

389
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,156
It may not win the war,

390
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,755
but it would make them think
about negotiated peace. Hm?

391
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,435
A negotiated peace?

392
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,034
I will put that to my men also.

393
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,916
God bless all here.

394
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,990
- Give us a glass of your strongest.
- Gestapo.

395
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,197
So that's how the Gestapo dress
in Berlin these days?

396
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,032
- Gestapo?
- Drink?

397
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,680
I haven't sucked my thumb in years.

398
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,320
I wonder if you'd do it for me?

399
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,474
- Sir?
- Suck it.

400
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,269
Now, about your Mr... er, Devlin.

401
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,114
A man of considerable resource
and guile, I assure you.

402
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,519
Tell me something, Mr. Devlin.
Just why are you coming along?

403
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,673
Can't you tell? I'm the last
of the world's great adventurers.

404
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,914
Sweet Mary, Mother of God.

405
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,269
Tough bunch of lads in there, Colonel!

406
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,038
What did he say?

407
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,192
Steiner insisted on
the unanimous consent of his men.

408
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,793
I'm not surprised.

409
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,668
If they agree, you'll leave tonight
for Southern Ireland.

410
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,673
- Close to the Ulster border.
- Tonight? What about my papers?

411
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,548
Your Irish passport and British
medical discharge have been provided.

412
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,596
Starling's found you a job.

413
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,150
You'll be a... marsh warden,
whatever that is.

414
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,959
It's a marsh warden.
What about the money?

415
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,918
- £10,000 first...
- No, I asked for £20,000.

416
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,470
10,000 has been deposited
in Geneva as per instructions.

417
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,233
Ten more
upon completion of the mission.

418
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,870
You think I'd sell out?

419
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,270
You've been so expensive
to buy in the first place.

420
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,070
You are going to jump in those clothes?

421
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,312
I might look a little bit silly
going down, Mr. Steiner,

422
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,631
but I'll be a lot safer
when I land on the ground.

423
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,475
There's an old poem which,
translated from the Irish, says,

424
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,075
"I realized fear one morning

425
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,435
"To the blare
of the fox hunters' sound

426
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,478
"When they're all chasing after
the poor bloody fox

427
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,632
"It's safer to be dressed like the hound"

428
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,438
You're quite literary.

429
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,798
If the truth be known, Colonel,
I'm a bloody literary genius.

430
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,792
- Your complete instructions.
- Right.

431
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,429
All of it - everything? No cyanide pill?

432
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,469
I couldn't conceive of a situation
which would force you to take one.

433
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,990
It's a little trick I learned
from my uncle in Belfast.

434
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,356
In the Middle Ages they would
have burned you for that.

435
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,116
Goodbye, Mr. Devlin.
I will see you in England.

436
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,156
I'll be there.

437
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,230
- How do I jump out?
- Release your safety belt.

438
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,437
I turn the aircraft upside-down,
you drop out.

439
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,828
Has it occurred to you that
the signature on your authorization

440
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,876
could just be a forgery?

441
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,316
Why not fly to Berchtesgaden
and ask him yourself?

442
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,391
Let's not bother the man.

443
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,912
Mrs. Joanna Grey?

444
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,118
- That's right.
- Liam Devlin.

445
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,671
I could do with a cup of tea.
It's been a hell of a journey.

446
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,436
Come inside.

447
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,711
That's a neat trick.

448
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,156
We're both Irish, your wolfhound and me.

449
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,549
- What's her name?
- Patch.

450
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,790
Oh, Patch, is it?

451
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,476
Sit down, Mr. Devlin.

452
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,916
It's lovely, the countryside, isn't it?

453
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,599
You'd hardly know there was
a war on. Patch!

454
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,194
They're living
in a fool's paradise.

455
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,955
They lack the discipline
the Führer has brought to Germany.

456
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,600
These are papers you'll need.

457
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,797
I'll give you the ones they gave to me.

458
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,236
You know Sir Henry
is away for some time

459
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,153
and only the servants
are in the manor house?

460
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,073
Does anyone else know
Churchill will be here?

461
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,912
Only Father Verecker.

462
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,395
Your duties, in the main,
will be merely gamekeeping.

463
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:42,474
You've got a motorbike parked outside
and you can have this shotgun.

464
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,516
It is loaded.

465
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:50,475
- You know the way to the cottage?
- Down the road, the pub's on the right,

466
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,917
and I go through the manor house gates,
to the end of the lane.

467
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,074
Here's the keys.
Oh, petrol for the motorbike -

468
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,913
the ration allowance is only
three gallons a month.

469
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,514
I hope I won't be here that long,
Mrs. Grey.

470
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,037
They sent you over rather late.
Churchill arrives the day after tomorrow.

471
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:16,955
Colonel Radl sends his apologies,
there was nothing he could do about it.

472
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,396
This should be more than enough
for the vehicles we need.

473
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,995
I assume your contacts are reliable?

474
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,036
You take after me.

475
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:31,875
By the way, I would advise you
not to use stolen commercial petrol.

476
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,518
It contains a red dye...

477
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,195
Which comes out if you put it
through a gas mask. May I?

478
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,236
Oh, by all means.

479
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,314
To the English Enterprise.

480
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,313
I think you and I will get along famously.

481
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,834
On the contrary, Mr. Devlin.

482
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,789
The success of the mission depends
entirely on the distance we keep.

483
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,430
Morning.

484
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,192
Walk on.

485
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,039
Good day to you, cailín.

486
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,032
- God save the good work.
- Oh, watch your back!

487
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,190
- My back?!
- Mr. Devlin.

488
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,191
Mr. Devlin, is it?

489
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,636
Mrs. Grey told us about you
at the last WVS meeting.

490
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,472
You're the new marsh warden.

491
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,235
And you're with
the Women's Voluntary Service.

492
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,799
I help out.

493
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,110
When I have the time.

494
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,317
Sort of erm... servicing the troops, is it?

495
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,798
I don't mind.

496
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,713
Miss, I do believe you're
a little bit of a tease.

497
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,951
Children tease, Mr. Devlin,
and I am almost 19.

498
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,270
Go on. Go on.

499
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,916
God bless all here.

500
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,719
Can I have a glass
of your strongest, please?

501
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,839
- I'm George Wilde, the publican.
- Liam Devlin, marsh warden.

502
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,038
That's Arthur Seymour
and over by the fire, Laker Armsby.

503
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,076
Will you join me in a drink?

504
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,993
- A pint of bitter.
- Pint of bitter. Sir?

505
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,036
I buys me own.

506
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,873
Coming in here
with your shotgun and motorbike,

507
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,476
buying drinks for us estate workers
who content themselves with less.

508
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,074
It can only be because of my good looks.

509
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,879
Make fun of me
and I'll squash you like a slug.

510
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,916
Arthur!

511
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,191
You walk soft around here.
You keep your place...

512
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,510
and stay away from Molly Prior.

513
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,556
If I've caused any offence, I'm sorry.

514
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,358
Arthur, get out!

515
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,154
Today I leave, boy, but from now on,
when you see me, you leave.

516
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,517
One and nine, please.

517
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,150
- Good day, Father.
- Oh, good afternoon.

518
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,277
Liam Devlin - I'm Sir Henry's
new marsh warden.

519
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:42,036
- I'm just introducing myself around.
- I'm Father Verecker.

520
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:46,830
This is my sister Pamela, she's up
from Mildenhall on a weekend's leave.

521
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,718
- Your sister? How do you do?
- How do you do?

522
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,631
I'll be back for tea, Father.

523
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,109
- Goodbye, Mr. Devlin.
- Goodbye.

524
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,397
We have a small
if loyal congregation here, Mr. Devlin.

525
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,789
I look forward to your adding to it.

526
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,599
- You are Catholic?
- Oh, yes, Father.

527
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,593
- Did you come for confession?
- Oh, with apologies, Father,

528
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,148
this poor soul is well past redemption.

529
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,597
God forgive me, but this confessional
could do with a few spicy revelations.

530
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,117
Don't forget the words of our Lord,
Mr. Devlin - "The last shall be first."

531
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,556
In that case, I'm assured a place
at the head of the line.

532
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,392
Where did you find this?

533
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,519
A DC3, captured almost intact.

534
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,954
- Gericke.
- Herr Oberst.

535
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,350
- Will it be ready in time?
- No problem.

536
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,435
Where did she go? Eh?

537
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,436
All right, my friend.

538
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,993
What kept you?

539
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,954
"What kept me," is it?
Why, you little devil!

540
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,349
My God, and I'll know you till
Doomsday, that's for sure.

541
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,989
- What does that mean?
- It's an expression from where I come.

542
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,957
- You use these?
- No.

543
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,191
Good for you. They stunt your growth.

544
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,670
You with your green years
still ahead of you.

545
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,910
Almost 19, eh?

546
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,509
- What month?
- February.

547
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:34,109
- 25th?
- 22nd.

548
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,760
But I was right, you're a little fish.

549
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,196
We should get along well -
me being a Scorpio.

550
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,838
Never marry a Virgo.

551
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,593
Virgo and Pisces never hit it off.

552
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,671
Take Arthur, for example.

553
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,194
I think he's Virgo, watch it with him.

554
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,398
Arthur? Arthur Seymour? Are you crazy?

555
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,436
No, but I think he is.

556
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,557
Pure, clean, virtuous...

557
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,872
and not very hot - that's a Virgo.

558
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,111
Ah, it's a terrible shame
from where I'm lying.

559
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,356
You'll have a weight problem
if you don't watch your food.

560
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,476
Bastard!

561
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,710
Are you laughing at me?

562
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,633
What else would you have me
do with you, Molly Prior?

563
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,472
Don't answer that.

564
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,715
How do you know my name?

565
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,756
George Wilde told me at the pub.

566
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,876
Oh, I see!

567
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,272
- And Arthur, was he there?
- You could say that.

568
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:37,070
I get the feeling that he looks upon you
as his personal property.

569
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,515
He can go to hell - I belong to no man.

570
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,158
Your nose turns up.

571
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:45,074
And when you get angry,
your mouth turns down at the corners.

572
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:49,233
I'm sure you could find a hundred things
wrong with me... a thousand!

573
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,869
But you wouldn't throw me
out of your bed on a wet Saturday night.

574
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,713
That's men for you -
anything's better than nothing.

575
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,916
Wait! Come here!

576
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,600
You don't know the first thing about me.

577
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,116
Because if you did,
you'd know that I much prefer

578
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,351
a warm autumn afternoon
under the pines...

579
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,396
to a wet Saturday night, any day.

580
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,392
The sand has a terrible way
of getting where it shouldn't be.

581
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:27,074
Get out of here, before I let
my mad passion run away with me.

582
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,116
Go on, get! Get!

583
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,398
They told me all Irishmen were crazy...

584
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,436
now I believe them.

585
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:52,149
- I'll be at Mass on Sunday, will you?
- Do I look like I will?

586
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,076
Yes. I think you do.

587
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,753
Oh, Devlin, you bloody idiot.

588
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,796
You never learn.

589
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,552
Never bloody learn.

590
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,959
It is out there, Hans.

591
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,395
160 miles west.

592
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,310
We've been on tough ones before.

593
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,359
The kidnapping
of the British prime minister.

594
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,274
If successful, will be a shot in the arm
for German morale.

595
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:44,433
But I agree. It won't stop the bombers
from making their daily runs.

596
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:48,911
The men considered that
before they agreed to go.

597
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,915
The men, as I once remarked
to a certain Gruppenführer in Poland,

598
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,798
feel a loyalty to me.

599
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,237
Which, God help me,
I may merely be taking advantage of.

600
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,114
You tell me, Hans.
Is it a legitimate mission

601
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:13,716
or have I simply agreed
to an elaborate way of killing myself

602
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,870
and taking all of you with me?

603
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:23,196
There is Radl's point -
of a negotiated peace.

604
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,748
Hm, a negotiated peace.

605
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,558
I laughed when he said that.

606
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,910
But supposing he's right, hm?

607
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,754
But then negotiated on behalf of whom?

608
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,831
On behalf of the men who lead us

609
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,629
or on behalf of Germany as a whole,
as she will be one day?

610
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:47,589
The Gruppenführer from Poland will be
part of the Germany she will be one day.

611
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,477
So, by God, will we.

612
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,556
Mother of God.

613
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,916
Look at that now.

614
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:00,112
- What kept you?
- Very clever.

615
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:04,749
After I came back to make sure
you put the pie in the oven.

616
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:08,879
- But then I suppose you've eaten.
- Just get the pie into the oven.

617
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,712
That's better.

618
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:14,110
- What's this?
- Trinity College, Dublin.

619
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,839
- Football?
- Art and literature.

620
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:22,313
- What are you reading?
- Some poetry.

621
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,437
- Read it.
- "Read it", is it?

622
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:37,634
- It's a foreign language.
- Irish, the language of the kings.

623
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:40,996
It's very beautiful.
Liam - is that Irish too?

624
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,514
- Yes.
- What does it mean?

625
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,876
- William.
- No, I think I prefer Liam.

626
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,351
- William is so ordinary.
- Jesus, Joseph and Mary heed me.

627
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,228
- What does that mean?
- It means that if you don't get the pie,

628
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,515
I won't be responsible.

629
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,591
Oh, I do like you, do you know that?

630
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,832
From the first moment I saw you,
Mr. Devlin, sitting astride your bike.

631
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,876
The pie.

632
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,430
- Pie's not ready yet.
- How did you get it here?

633
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,159
- This morning.
- Oh.

634
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,357
- Read.
- "Read", is it?

635
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,829
Give me that book over there,
the blue one.

636
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,112
Sit down.

637
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,156
I'll read you the end of this.

638
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,196
"And then I asked him
with my eyes to ask again yes

639
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,510
"and then he asked me would I yes

640
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,114
"to say yes my mountain flower

641
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,316
"and first I put my arms around him yes

642
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,551
"and drew him down to me so he could
feel my breasts all perfume yes

643
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,756
"and his heart was going like mad

644
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:47,355
"and yes I said yes I will Yes."

645
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:54,473
- Is that Irish too?
- Yes.

646
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,796
Himmler sends personal wishes
for success from the Führer himself.

647
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,915
You've altered the parachutes. Why?

648
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,074
Unfortunately, we have high tide
at first light when we must drop.

649
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,754
So we may land in the surf.

650
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:15,549
These slots enable us to guide the chute.

651
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:21,476
It's experimental and the landing
velocity is high, but we have no choice.

652
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,676
I assume they've been tested.

653
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,910
Jawohl, Herr Oberst.

654
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,073
I have one request.

655
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,116
A demand, actually.

656
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,475
Blackmail at this point, hm?

657
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,355
We are not spies

658
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,398
and will not be treated
as such by the British

659
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,119
if anything goes wrong.

660
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,670
We will wear our own uniforms
under the Polish outfits

661
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:04,914
and if necessary, we will fight
and die as what we are -

662
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,956
German paratroopers.

663
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:14,513
Max, it is not a subject for negotiation.

664
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,917
- In that case, agreed.
- Thank you.

665
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,637
Hello, Liam.

666
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,278
My compliments on the dress.

667
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,316
It's a great improvement.

668
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,232
Why pick on me?

669
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:53,791
Because you're lovely, because
you could never fall in love with me.

670
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:56,713
But I might... just for spite.

671
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:00,588
It wouldn't matter -
I could never fall in love with you.

672
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:03,752
I'm bad for you, we've no future.

673
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:07,913
I'm not telling you that
to make you want me more. It's the truth.

674
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,151
I'm here - your turn to leave.

675
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:14,951
Oh, God.

676
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:32,153
Arthur, did I ever tell you
about the uncle I've got in Belfast?

677
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,396
Of course I didn't.

678
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,350
He was a bare-knuckle boxer.

679
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,718
I'm just telling him about the Holy Trinity.

680
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,116
You know it?

681
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,953
Footwork, timing and hitting.

682
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,910
And a little bit of dirty work.

683
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,274
"Learn these," my uncle would say.

684
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,920
"You'll inherit the earth like the meek."

685
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,309
You never know when to lie down.

686
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,356
Liam!

687
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,555
Well, Arthur, looks like
he bought you a drink after all!

688
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:17,710
I told you not to come here tonight.

689
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:21,076
I wanted you to come home
to a proper fire.

690
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,799
When I went to the wood bin
I found those.

691
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,915
Now put it back, there's a good girl.

692
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,752
What is it?

693
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,592
What does it mean?

694
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:36,434
Molly, my own sweetheart,
I love you dearly,

695
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,476
but any more games like this

696
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,233
and I'll give you
the thrashing of your life.

697
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,433
Size ten. Was I right?

698
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,272
Silk stockings.

699
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,918
Real silk.

700
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,631
Where did you get these?

701
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:57,598
You can get anything...
if you know where to look.

702
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,591
Black market.

703
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,636
That's what it is.

704
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,029
Why can't you be nice and normal?

705
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:06,759
Would you have me in my grave
so early?

706
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,195
Now go get the tea.

707
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,953
Or do you want to report me
to the police?

708
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,076
Oh, Liam.

709
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,873
It's perfect...

710
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,520
but which way is England?

711
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,353
You. Tell Oberst Radl who you are.

712
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,389
Kapral Andrzej Jankowski.

713
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,436
You.

714
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:51,792
Kapral Stanislav Kunicki,
as you very well know.

715
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,836
Get back in line.

716
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,994
I'm very much impressed.

717
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:19,993
You know, it all started as a joke,
an insane joke.

718
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:24,232
I hope that Winston Churchill
appreciates our sense of humor.

719
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,234
- Good luck, Steiner.
- Thank you, Max.

720
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:36,078
'Falcon, this is Eagle.
Are you receiving me? '

721
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,799
Eagle this is Falcon, receiving you.

722
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,314
'What are conditions over the nest? '

723
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,870
Visibility good, cloud cover low,
wind freshening.

724
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,916
'Eagle out.'

725
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:19,354
Well... what do you think his game is?

726
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,795
Black market... or worse?

727
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:29,431
There's two army trucks outside
without numbers on... yet.

728
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,988
This... German.

729
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,071
It's worse!

730
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:38,277
Arthur, if you love me,
don't breathe a word until...

731
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:41,875
I'll have that bastard
arrested within the hour.

732
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,635
I've never meant to tease you.
I know I have, but I never meant to.

733
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:49,388
- You lying tart.
- I love him, Arthur.

734
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,869
What you do to him, you do to me.

735
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:55,031
You can both rot in hell.

736
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,076
Stop, Arthur!

737
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,559
I won't let you go!
