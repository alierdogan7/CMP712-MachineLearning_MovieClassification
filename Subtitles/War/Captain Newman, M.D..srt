Nurse!

3
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:07,422
Will you call psycho ward
and tell Captain Newman

4
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,182
his lousy flock's
on the loose again?

5
00:02:10,262 --> 00:02:11,582
Okay!

6
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:14,461
Let's go.

7
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,899
Hendricks will drop
your bag off at the BOQ.

8
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:29,819
Thanks, Captain.
Sure.

9
00:02:43,778 --> 00:02:45,138
Six copies, please.
Colonel Larrabee, please.

10
00:02:45,218 --> 00:02:46,578
I'm Lieutenant Alderson.

00:02:46,658 --> 00:02:48,018
I'm Larrabee, Lieutenant.

12
00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:50,378

wired you were coming.

13
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,018

00:02:55,056 --> 00:02:57,016
Who the devil's in charge
of this hospital?

16
00:02:57,056 --> 00:02:58,296
You or Dr. Newman?

17
00:02:58,376 --> 00:03:00,696
His Ward 7's got
the lowest
return-to-duty rate

18
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,575
in the entire
Area Command.

19
00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:06,175

And a prize...

23
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:18,055
Why don't you take
a look around, Lieutenant,
and come back later?

24
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:19,095
All right.

What's on your mind,
Lieutenant?

28
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:17,208
Nothing, sir.

29
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:20,808
That's dandy,
but hardly plausible.

30
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:22,288

31
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:25,568
Thank you, sir.

32
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:37,928
Well, how do you feel?

33
00:04:38,008 --> 00:04:39,246
Quite well, sir.

34
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:43,125
How do you feel?

35
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:50,045

I'm here as a patient?

38
00:04:58,285 --> 00:04:59,445
Well, aren't you?

00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:01,605

Well, what do you
know about that?

43
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:13,524
And here I was,

44
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,882
Guarded, a little tense,
nice party manners,

45
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:19,722
not quite so secure
as you'd like me to think.

46

Sit down.

47
00:05:24,882 --> 00:05:27,482
We're making a survey
of the capacity of
stateside base hospitals

48
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:29,482
to handle the flow of
overseas casualties.

49
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,201
Well, that's quite
a mouthful for a report

50
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:33,321
you could write
on a cigarette paper.

51
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:37,081
We're short of beds,
doctors, orderlies,
nurses, everything.

52
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:38,481
Except patients.

53
00:05:38,521 --> 00:05:39,961
Particularly
in your field.

54
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:43,641
Our charts show
an alarming increase
in neuropsychiatric cases.

55
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:44,681
Far beyond the norm.

56
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:48,241
How do you data demons
determine a norm?

57
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:51,719
Well, sir, we have
facts and figures and...

58
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,319
Yes, Gavoni?
Haskell's hallucinating again.

59
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:55,759
He's under his bed
fighting the Japanese,

60
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:57,918
yelling and screaming
he wants to go home.

61
00:05:57,998 --> 00:05:59,558
Does he have
a favorite in food?

62
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:01,318
Chocolate malts.

63
00:06:01,398 --> 00:06:04,158
Well, then, you get him
a nice, big chocolate malt
with cookies.

64
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:07,078
Put it on the floor
near his bed
where he can see it.

65
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,158
Tell him
he'll hurt my feelings

66
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:10,158
if he isn't back in his bed
by the time I come round.

67
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:11,918
Roger!
Roger.

68
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:16,478
We say Roger quite
a bit around here.

69
00:06:16,558 --> 00:06:18,398
Makes us feel like heroes.

70
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,437
Why don't you
loosen your tie
before you suffocate?

71
00:06:22,837 --> 00:06:24,237
Sir, our charts show...

72
00:06:24,277 --> 00:06:26,115
You can forget
about that "sir."

73
00:06:26,155 --> 00:06:28,515
My first name is Joe.
What's yours?

74
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,075
Belden.

75
00:06:31,835 --> 00:06:32,915
What?

76
00:06:34,155 --> 00:06:35,275
Belden.

77
00:06:37,555 --> 00:06:39,955
Is that what your friends
actually call you? Belden?

78
00:06:40,035 --> 00:06:41,275
No, my friends
call me Barney.

79
00:06:41,355 --> 00:06:44,355
Congratulations!
You've got fine friends.

80
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:47,514
Now, about that
alarming increase
in N.P. Cases, Barney,

81
00:06:47,594 --> 00:06:49,794
here's the reason why.

82
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:52,554
Now, during the first
18 months of the war,

83
00:06:52,634 --> 00:06:54,234
the files were almost empty.

84
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,714
So was Ward 7.

85
00:06:57,274 --> 00:06:59,954
In those days,
these men weren't
considered to be sick.

86
00:07:00,034 --> 00:07:02,792
Some tossed their
cookies every time
they had to go up.

87
00:07:02,832 --> 00:07:03,832
Some of them
had nightmares.

88
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:06,712
Some of them shook
so hard they couldn't
even hold a spoon.

89
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:07,952
But they went up!

90
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:10,192
No mollycoddling
in the Air Corps.

91
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:11,351
No, sirree!

92
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:15,991
You couldn't convince
anyone that
these were symptoms!

93
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:17,511
Symptoms!

94
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:19,351
And that a symptom
is a red flag

95
00:07:19,431 --> 00:07:21,511
with danger
written all over it.

96
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:23,071
Now you wouldn't think
it'd take much brains

97
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,831
to comprehend that,
would you?

98
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,391
So acute anxiety cases
were sent into combat,

99
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:30,911
and sooner or later,
they began to crack up.

100
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:35,151
Now they're streaming back
from Europe, from Africa,

101
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:38,188
from the Pacific.

102
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:44,548
And when we do get them,
we get six weeks to
get them back into duty,

103
00:07:44,628 --> 00:07:47,508
discharge them
or send them to
a permanent hospital.

104
00:07:47,588 --> 00:07:50,868
And every time
I hold a man over,
all hell breaks loose.

105
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:52,508
Excuse me, Captain.

106
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:54,948
What do you say, Blodgett?
Time for morning rounds.

107
00:07:54,988 --> 00:07:56,788
Well, all right.
Roger.

108
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:04,027
You ever been inside
of a psychiatric ward?

109
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:07,907
Well, no...
Come on. You're invited.

110
00:08:09,747 --> 00:08:10,947
KOPP: Hey, Doc.

111
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:14,305
A new man checked in
around 9:30 this morning.

112
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:16,385
Violent?
No, he's not a patient.

113
00:08:16,465 --> 00:08:18,665
He's a hospital orderly.
What? Where?

114
00:08:18,745 --> 00:08:21,505
Well, right now
he's on his way to
administration to report in.

115
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,545
He's scheduled for Ward 4.

116
00:08:24,385 --> 00:08:25,824
A mere detail.

117
00:08:25,864 --> 00:08:29,304
Now look,
you promise him girls,
furloughs, anything.

118
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,784
Wrap him in cotton wool
and deliver him to my office.

119
00:08:31,864 --> 00:08:32,984
Roger.

120
00:08:34,464 --> 00:08:35,864
We had to put
Miller in wet packs.

121
00:08:35,944 --> 00:08:38,904
That major in 4G
became pretty violent
around 4:00 p.m.

122
00:08:38,944 --> 00:08:41,984
And Wilkinson made that
phone call to his father.

123
00:08:45,184 --> 00:08:46,544
If you're a member
of the club,

124
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:48,422
it means sodium
pentothal treatment.

125
00:08:48,502 --> 00:08:49,622
PYSER: Newman!

126
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:55,941
Excuse me.

127
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:01,901
Colonel?

128
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:04,861
Captain Newman.

129
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,861
This report of yours
on Colonel Bliss,

130
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:10,181
that the only basis
you have for grounding him?

131
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:11,341
Yes, sir.

132
00:09:11,421 --> 00:09:15,380
Because of a
trivial incident at the
Officers' Club last night?

133
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,500
Well, I don't recall
using the word "trivial"
anywhere in there, Colonel.

134
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,260
(CHUCKLING)
Come now, Newman.

135
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,978
He chewed out
a second lieutenant
for spilling his drink.

136
00:09:23,058 --> 00:09:25,538
So what? He apologized
to him a moment later,
didn't he?

137
00:09:25,618 --> 00:09:28,218
Yes, sir.
And he apologized again

138
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:29,698
and again and again,

139
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:33,698
until the lieutenant,
in sheer embarrassment,
had to leave the place.

140
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:35,898
His behavior was
out of proportion,
to my mind...

141
00:09:35,978 --> 00:09:38,378
I know, I know.
Symptomatic of
mental disturbance.

142
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,737
Quote, unquote.

143
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:44,017
You're bound and determined
to get Colonel Bliss

144
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:46,817
into that Sunnybrook Farm
of yours, aren't you?

145
00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:48,377
Well, you're not.

146
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:51,377
Because he doesn't belong
with your prize collection
of oddballs,

147
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:54,177
malingerers
and yellow-bellies

148
00:09:54,257 --> 00:09:55,657
who get themselves
a rest cure

149
00:09:55,737 --> 00:09:57,577
by coming to you with
a cock-and-bull story

150
00:09:57,657 --> 00:10:00,655
about how they get
the sweats every time they
think of home and mother.

151
00:10:00,695 --> 00:10:04,734
Colonel, every man
in Ward 7 is sick.

152
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:07,414
I think that
Colonel Bliss
may be sick, too.

153
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:09,494
You think he may be sick?

154
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:10,974
I'm sorry I can't
be more specific,

155
00:10:11,054 --> 00:10:12,374
but the kind of
sickness we deal with

156
00:10:12,454 --> 00:10:14,414
doesn't show up in
X-rays or fluoroscopes.

157
00:10:14,494 --> 00:10:16,454
It shows up in behavior.

158
00:10:17,254 --> 00:10:19,414
Colonel Bliss is one
of the most brilliant
tacticians

159
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,374
fighting the air war
in the Pacific.

160
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,654
And he's needed back
at his command!

161
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:26,494
Well, if he is unstable,
he shouldn't be back
at his command.

162
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:29,613
The lives of too many men
depend on his judgment.

163
00:10:32,413 --> 00:10:34,291
Larrabee.
Sir.

164
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:36,491
I'm ordering a special
medical hearing for
Colonel Bliss.

165
00:10:36,531 --> 00:10:40,931
I don't want Captain Newman
present or anyone influenced
by Captain Newman.

166
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:46,811
Just stay close
to me, Barney.

167
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:49,451
Try to look as if
it's all old stuff.

168

Gentlemen, prepare
for morning rounds.

183
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:50,724
Well, Arthur,
how's everything?

184
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:55,124
Patient slept fine.
Appetite good,
digestion marvelous,

185

sensational.

186
00:11:57,764 --> 00:12:00,524
Arthur Werbel,
ready for discharge, sir.

187
00:12:00,564 --> 00:12:03,284
But he ain't moving
an inch out of this
beautiful bed, Doc,

188
00:12:03,364 --> 00:12:05,204
because he's got it
made. Made.

189
00:12:05,284 --> 00:12:06,524
You can say
that again, sailor.

190
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:09,243
But you're gonna
have to develop
some symptoms.

191
00:12:09,323 --> 00:12:10,403
Now, how can I
keep you in here

192
00:12:10,483 --> 00:12:12,003
unless you show me
some symptoms?

193
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:15,123
Well, symptoms...
You describe them,
I'll develop them.

194
00:12:15,203 --> 00:12:16,803
I got talent, Doc. Look.

195
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:18,563
Oh, gee. Oh, Doc.

196
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:19,803
Right here in the gut,
they got me.

197

Oh, I'm dying.

give me a kiss
before I kick off.

199
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:27,841
Now, that alone proves
I'm off my rocker. Right?

200
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:31,561
Wouldn't fool an intern
in Ward 2. You know
how dumb they are.

201
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:33,041
They got me
in the back, Doc.

202
00:12:33,121 --> 00:12:36,640
I'm burning up.
Oh, Doc. I'm dying.

203
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,160
No, don't touch that.

204
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,040

No jerk is getting
this hat off my head!

I'm getting
out of here, see.

207
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,160
I'm busting out
of here and heading
for the Navy to be

208
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,840
with my brother Frank.

209
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,760
Frank is my brother!

210
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,760
Who's helping him, huh?
Who's looking after him?

211
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,040
Now take it easy, sailor.

212
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,677
In a pig's eye.
I didn't ask to be
in this cheesy Air Corps.

213
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:03,517
I should be out
looking after Frank.

214
00:13:05,397 --> 00:13:06,757
Doc, I'll...

215
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:09,277
I'll do anything, honest.

216
00:13:09,357 --> 00:13:11,597
I'll do anything in the Navy.
I'll swab the decks,

217
00:13:11,677 --> 00:13:15,917
I'll take top deck ack-ack,
I'll stay down in the sub.

218
00:13:17,277 --> 00:13:18,877
You got to fix it.

219
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:22,877
You, please,
got to get me out of here.

220
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:24,396
Please.

221
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:27,076
We need a little more time.

222
00:13:31,154 --> 00:13:32,314
Why don't you tell
the lieutenant here

223
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,234
that you didn't really
want him to drop dead?

224
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:36,314
Hmm?

225
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:44,394
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
I... I take it all back.

to drop dead.

229
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:02,393
Would it help any
if he could see
his brother?

230
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:05,233
It might, except he
doesn't have a brother.

231
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:07,871
Well, Bobby.

232
00:14:08,951 --> 00:14:11,111

word today?

233

how nicely you can say it.

You said "hello"
for me this morning.
Remember?

238
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,350
He did, Doc.

239
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,110
I heard him say "hello"
plain as anything.

240
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,630
It'll come, Bobby.

241
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,789

How you feeling?

242
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:43,987

not eating right.

All right.

Twenty-seven.

I believe that it's
customary for a soldier

to address an officer
as "sir."

What's to tell?

308

Let's see.
The camp I just came from...

I don't want to
knock the government,
you understand,

310
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:29,046
but the animals
in the Bronx Zoo
had it better.

311
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:33,206
They had me working in
the wards day and night
for 10 months steady.

312
00:18:33,606 --> 00:18:34,566
I didn't like it.

313
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,286
You mustn't hide
your feelings.

314
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,046
That's what I figured.

315
00:18:40,646 --> 00:18:43,806
Well, what kinds of wards
did you work in?

316
00:18:43,846 --> 00:18:45,086

00:19:02,323 --> 00:19:06,283
Have you ever worked
in an N.P. Ward?

They are not nuts.

Gee, Doc,
you're not gonna put me
in a nut house.

328
00:19:14,562 --> 00:19:16,202
It is not a nut house.
I'll drop dead.

Inside of one hour
I'll drop dead.

to lay down.

are just depressed.

00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,160

339
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,680

a perfectly safe ward.

340
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,639
There is no danger involved.

345
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,839
Don't spoil your record,
Captain.

346
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:52,759
I'll take my chances.

347
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,359
Now, do you have
any questions?

348
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:56,759
You don't have to
raise your hand.

349
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,799
I'm as surprised
as you that I still
have the strength.

350
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:00,439
Ask the question.

351
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,316
Captain, I appreciate you
trying to boost my morale,

352
00:20:03,356 --> 00:20:04,636
but let us face facts.

353
00:20:04,716 --> 00:20:07,716
It goes against my grain.
You are putting me
in a booby hatch.

354
00:20:07,796 --> 00:20:11,036
Leibowitz, what the devil
is the matter with you?

355
00:20:11,116 --> 00:20:12,276
You look like
an intelligent...

356
00:20:12,356 --> 00:20:13,476
Don't be fooled
by my looks.

357
00:20:13,556 --> 00:20:14,836
But you'll get
the best food
on the post...

358
00:20:14,876 --> 00:20:16,716
Who's got an appetite?

359
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:18,036
You have my
deepest sympathy.

360
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:19,876
From a plumber
I expect sympathy.

361
00:20:19,956 --> 00:20:22,516
From a psychiatrist
I expect understanding.

362
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:26,076
Corporal Leibowitz
has just volunteered
to work with us.

363
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:27,715
But Captain...
Would you like
Sergeant Kopp

364
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:29,195
to show you around now?
No.

365
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:30,675
No, what?
No, sir.

366
00:20:30,755 --> 00:20:32,835
Good. Start with
the ward, Arkie.

367
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:34,595
But, Captain, I've...

368
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:38,713
Let's go, Leibowitz.

369
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:41,833
Glad to have you
with us.

370
00:20:41,913 --> 00:20:42,873
(SHEEP BLEATING)
You think so, huh?

371
00:20:42,953 --> 00:20:45,793
People always make
that mistake until
they get to know me.

372
00:20:45,873 --> 00:20:48,033
Hey. Already
I'm hearing things.

373
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,953
What's that...

374
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:51,552
You're not hearing
anything yet.

375
00:20:51,632 --> 00:20:54,792
We keep sheep
in the back yard
for tests for the lab.

376
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:58,352
How about a nice game
of gin tonight?

377
00:20:58,432 --> 00:21:00,232
Who plans that far ahead?

378
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:03,912
LEIBOWITZ: I'm living
from minute to minute.

379
00:21:04,592 --> 00:21:06,472
He'll make
a good orderly,
Blodgie.

380
00:21:06,552 --> 00:21:08,272
He understands suffering.

381
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:13,390
You're leveling, Doc.
I'm all right now?

382
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,030
You're as normal
as fleas on a dog.

383
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,389
All that's left is
for you to realize it.

384
00:21:18,469 --> 00:21:19,869
You better get
around to it.

385
00:21:19,949 --> 00:21:21,629
I've got you marked
fit for duty.

386
00:21:21,709 --> 00:21:23,589
You're going back
to your outfit.

387
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:25,109
I am? When?

388
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:27,629
I think I can steal you
a 10-day pass.

389
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:31,069
Ten days at home
with your family
and after that...

390
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:33,549
So, start packing.
I need your bed.

391
00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:35,829
You've got it, sir.

392
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:37,269
And I got a 4:10 bus
to catch.

393
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:43,308
<i>LEIBOWITZ: (SINGING)
Old MacDonald had a farm,
E- I-E-l-O</i>

394
00:21:43,948 --> 00:21:48,146
<i>And on that farm
he had some chicks</i>

395
00:21:48,186 --> 00:21:50,226
Your new orderly is
standing on a chair,

396
00:21:50,306 --> 00:21:52,426
conducting
the Colfax Glee Club.

397
00:21:52,506 --> 00:21:54,866
Next, he'll be
passing out lollipops.

398
00:21:55,546 --> 00:21:57,266
<i>MEN: (SINGING)
Here a chick, there a chick</i>

399
00:21:57,346 --> 00:21:58,386
<i>Everywhere a chick, chick</i>

400
00:21:58,466 --> 00:22:01,666
LEIBOWITZ: Come on, you guys.
Louder. Everybody.

401
00:22:01,746 --> 00:22:05,666
Come on, you crazy bums.
Don't you want to get well?
Sing!

402
00:22:05,746 --> 00:22:11,385
<i>Old MacDonald had a farm,
E- I-E-l-O</i>

403
00:22:14,185 --> 00:22:16,465
Well, yes, we set up
a medical hearing
for Tuesday,

404
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:18,185
but Colonel Bliss
begged off.

405
00:22:18,265 --> 00:22:20,705
And after all his yelling
to get out of here.

406
00:22:21,665 --> 00:22:22,663
Did he say why?

407
00:22:22,743 --> 00:22:23,703
No.

408
00:22:23,783 --> 00:22:25,983
I offered to set up
another hearing
at his convenience.

409
00:22:26,063 --> 00:22:28,343
He was to let me know,
and that was three days ago.

410
00:22:28,423 --> 00:22:30,103
How is that for a puzzler?

411
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,582
It worries me.

412
00:22:31,662 --> 00:22:34,502
Whatever was behind
that Officers' Club thing,

413
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:37,342
Colonel Bliss doesn't
think it was trivial.

414
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,462
(EXCLAIMS) Sorry, sir.

415
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:42,422
Oh, Colonel?
Yes.

416
00:22:42,502 --> 00:22:45,502
I finally solved
the mystery of
the missing orderly.

417
00:22:45,582 --> 00:22:48,022
Corporal Leibowitz
didn't vanish into
thin air.

418
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:50,662
He was somehow
maneuvered into
Ward 7

419
00:22:50,742 --> 00:22:52,902
and he's been
working there
ever since.

420
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,781
Isn't that so,
Captain Newman?

421
00:22:58,059 --> 00:22:59,939
Well, is it?
Well, I

422
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:03,779
couldn't call
an attractive girl
like that a liar.

423
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:06,699
Joe, you can't just
hijack a soldier

424
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:09,179
and put him in your ward
without telling anyone.

425
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:10,379
As far as the Army
is concerned,

426
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:11,939
Leibowitz has been AWOL
for two weeks.

427
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:13,179
You're absolutely
right, Colonel.

428
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,019
Excuse me for
just a moment.

429
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:16,139
BARNEY: Joe!

430
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:19,779
Well, I'll be shoving off.
Thanks for everything.

431
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:21,738
Pleasure having you, Barney.

432
00:23:21,778 --> 00:23:23,458
Say hello to
the Pentagon.

433
00:23:24,138 --> 00:23:25,578
(CHUCKLING)
We don't speak.

434
00:23:26,098 --> 00:23:27,098
Well, so long.

435
00:23:27,178 --> 00:23:28,378
So long.

436
00:23:31,658 --> 00:23:34,936
Lieutenant Corum,
I'm truly very sorry.

437
00:23:35,976 --> 00:23:38,776
I'll check my staff,
I'll find out who's
responsible for this.

438
00:23:38,856 --> 00:23:40,096
Try sodium pentothal.

439
00:23:40,176 --> 00:23:42,616
It's wonderful stuff
for getting at the truth.

440
00:23:42,696 --> 00:23:45,096
If that is what
we're after, Captain.

441
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:53,135
Well, Leibowitz probably
just happened to drift in.

442
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:58,415
Guess we'll have to put
the whole thing down to
a foul-up in paperwork.

443
00:24:01,535 --> 00:24:04,255
All right.
The truth is,
we needed him.

444
00:24:04,295 --> 00:24:06,175
You needed him?

445
00:24:06,215 --> 00:24:09,213
My ward and all the others
are shorthanded, too.

446
00:24:10,252 --> 00:24:11,612
Well, I'll tell you what.
We'll make a deal.

447
00:24:11,692 --> 00:24:13,252
The very next orderly
that checks in...

448
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:14,412
You'll let us have him.

449
00:24:14,492 --> 00:24:16,972
Now what could be
fairer than that?

450
00:24:20,812 --> 00:24:22,212
The next two.

451
00:24:25,892 --> 00:24:27,092
A deal?

452
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:28,972
A deal.

453
00:24:30,372 --> 00:24:31,812
I'm due back.

454
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:38,451
Oh, Corum, I wouldn't stew
about that Leibowitz thing.

455
00:24:38,531 --> 00:24:40,851
You'll get the next
orderly that comes in,

456
00:24:40,931 --> 00:24:43,051
if I have to deliver
him to you personally.

457
00:24:43,891 --> 00:24:45,849
A pair of them are
due in the morning.

458
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:49,649
Mmm-mmm.
They're arriving at
7:00 tonight, sir.

459
00:24:53,729 --> 00:24:54,929
Thanks.

460
00:24:55,489 --> 00:24:57,889
You're welcome.
Call on me anytime.

461
00:25:11,328 --> 00:25:12,648
Did you get
Haskell's lab report?

462
00:25:12,728 --> 00:25:14,368
I sent Arkie for it.

463
00:25:14,448 --> 00:25:16,568
You know,
this stuff is A, B, C.

464
00:25:16,608 --> 00:25:18,088
I don't know why they make
such a big thing about it.

465
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:21,966
Leibowitz, since when does
a corporal send a sergeant
on an errand?

466
00:25:22,046 --> 00:25:23,446
Don't answer that.

467
00:25:23,486 --> 00:25:25,365
Since Leibowitz
came to Ward 7.

468
00:25:27,645 --> 00:25:29,565
What do you mean,
A, B, C?

469
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:32,365
You went to
medical school for this?

470
00:25:32,445 --> 00:25:34,325
Well, it helped
fill in some time.

471
00:25:34,405 --> 00:25:36,285
I was small for my age.

472
00:25:37,205 --> 00:25:40,085
You see, Captain,
it's simple,
if you're good with people.

473
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:41,645
You see, I was always
good with people.

474
00:25:41,725 --> 00:25:44,565
Even in the fifth grade
the kids used to open up
to me.

475
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:45,925
"Jake, what should I do?

476
00:25:46,005 --> 00:25:48,845
"I feel lousy,
I feel great, I feel funny,
I'm all mixed-up.

477
00:25:48,925 --> 00:25:50,364
"Jake, what's
happening to me?"

478
00:25:50,444 --> 00:25:53,724
You see, in my group,
I was the unofficial couch.

479
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:56,202
Captain, I could
write one of these.

480
00:25:56,642 --> 00:26:00,362
Will you autograph me
a copy of the book when
you get around to it?

481
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:01,842
Sarcasm is for children.

482
00:26:01,882 --> 00:26:04,202
From a psychiatrist
I expect honestness.

483
00:26:04,282 --> 00:26:06,162
"Honesty," Jake,
not "honestness."

484
00:26:06,242 --> 00:26:08,122
So flunk me in English.

485
00:26:13,762 --> 00:26:16,081
Get Lieutenant Corum
in Ward 4 on the phone.

486
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:17,841
You want me to phone?

487
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:21,681
Yes, if you're not
required in surgery.

488
00:26:26,881 --> 00:26:28,201
<i>(SWING MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

489
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:46,038
I hope you're thirsty.

490
00:26:46,118 --> 00:26:47,278
Mmm-hmm.

491
00:26:51,158 --> 00:26:52,878
Ordered it in advance.

492
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:54,838
Here, I'll do that.

493
00:26:54,918 --> 00:26:56,158
Thank you very much.
Thanks.

494
00:26:56,238 --> 00:26:59,478
Since when does
the Blue Grotto serve
imported champagne?

495
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:01,798
Since Leibowitz
came to Ward 7.

496
00:27:02,358 --> 00:27:05,637
I don't know
where he got it,

497
00:27:05,717 --> 00:27:08,235
and I've learned not
to ask any questions.

498
00:27:16,795 --> 00:27:18,395
You want this now?

499
00:27:21,235 --> 00:27:23,475
Oh, my goodness.
How beautiful!
There we are.

500
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:28,355
Thank you.

501
00:27:28,435 --> 00:27:29,674
It's a little silly,
I suppose.

502
00:27:29,754 --> 00:27:32,234
I read somewhere
that a girl never
forgot those flowers

503
00:27:32,314 --> 00:27:33,434
once she'd been
to the Islands.

504
00:27:33,514 --> 00:27:34,594
It's true.

505
00:27:35,914 --> 00:27:37,914
How did you know
I was stationed
in Honolulu?

506
00:27:37,994 --> 00:27:39,914
Well, I heard it
somewhere.

507
00:27:39,994 --> 00:27:41,912
The Officers' Club,
I suppose.

508
00:27:43,272 --> 00:27:45,832
I thought maybe you
pulled my 201 file.

509
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:50,712
That would be
an invasion of privacy.

510
00:27:53,152 --> 00:27:54,991
It's a compliment,
in a way.

511
00:27:56,831 --> 00:27:59,071
Anyway, it would have
said that I'm single,

512
00:27:59,151 --> 00:28:00,871
my blood type is B.
NEWMAN: B.

513
00:28:02,031 --> 00:28:04,551
And that I wear a size...
A size 10 dress.

514
00:28:13,071 --> 00:28:15,431
Your blood type is A,

515
00:28:15,471 --> 00:28:17,869
and you were
in the glee club
at Farragut High School,

516
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:21,108
you have an appendix scar
right about here,
maybe a little farther over,

517
00:28:21,188 --> 00:28:22,828
and you did your
residency at Tulane.

518
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:24,788
You read my 201?
Mmm-hmm.

519
00:28:25,028 --> 00:28:26,788
All of it?
Don't be silly.

520
00:28:26,828 --> 00:28:28,868
You should know
no girl ever reads
past the space marked

521
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:30,868
"married" or "single."

522
00:28:30,948 --> 00:28:34,588
Well, if we're both
peeping Toms, let's have
a drink to that.

523
00:28:46,827 --> 00:28:47,987
Francie,

524
00:28:49,907 --> 00:28:51,987
you're a good-looking woman.

525
00:28:54,825 --> 00:28:56,105
Thank you.

526
00:28:56,345 --> 00:28:59,225
It's important to have
a good-looking woman around.

527
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:00,825
Big morale factor.

528
00:29:01,465 --> 00:29:03,905
It gives a man incentive.

529
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:10,064
Now, you take a man
cowering under a bed.

530
00:29:13,424 --> 00:29:15,784
I beg your pardon?
Cowering under a bed.

531
00:29:15,864 --> 00:29:17,304
You've seen Blodgett.

532
00:29:17,384 --> 00:29:19,224
Who'd come out for her?

533
00:29:20,064 --> 00:29:21,464
But one look
at your legs

534
00:29:21,544 --> 00:29:24,544
and they'd come
shooting right up
through the mattress.

535
00:29:24,624 --> 00:29:26,544
Any man in that ward.

536
00:29:26,624 --> 00:29:28,702
I think I understand,
but I'm not sure.

537
00:29:28,742 --> 00:29:30,982
And you're
thoroughly qualified.

538
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:32,902
Two years of
premed at Barnard,

539
00:29:32,942 --> 00:29:35,101
a full course
at Saint Vincent's.

540
00:29:35,141 --> 00:29:38,701
Year and a half at
Massachusetts General,
plus your service duties.

541
00:29:38,781 --> 00:29:40,381
Is that the reason
you pulled my 201?

542
00:29:40,421 --> 00:29:41,501
You're perfect for it.

543
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:42,941
For Ward 7.

544
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:46,101
You'd like me
to transfer?

545
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:50,901
And that's the reason
for the flowers
and the champagne.

546
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:51,901
Come on, let's dance.

547
00:29:51,981 --> 00:29:54,181
No. Let's fight.

548
00:29:54,261 --> 00:29:56,381
It's not gonna do
anybody any good if
you're gonna be cross...

549
00:29:56,421 --> 00:30:00,020
Just what makes you
think I'd join that
big funny farm of yours?

550
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,820
You're all off in
a world of your own.

551
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,618
Joining your crowd is
like taking the veil.
Not for me, friend.

552
00:30:04,698 --> 00:30:06,578
I don't regard that
as a "no" answer.

553
00:30:06,658 --> 00:30:08,218
That is a reaction,
not a judgment.

554
00:30:08,298 --> 00:30:09,818
Don't give me
any of your...

555
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:13,018
And as far as your
legs are concerned,

556
00:30:13,098 --> 00:30:15,618
I have never seen
a better example...

557
00:30:15,698 --> 00:30:17,538
Are you Captain Newman?

558
00:30:18,298 --> 00:30:19,858
Yes.
There's a telephone call.

559
00:30:19,938 --> 00:30:22,698
You can take it
right over here
at the bar.

560
00:30:24,097 --> 00:30:25,977
Excuse me, fellows.

561
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:27,217
Newman here.

562
00:30:27,297 --> 00:30:29,377
Boy, we got trouble.
Some colonel's gone berserk.

563
00:30:29,457 --> 00:30:30,977
<i>Who?
Bliss.</i>

564
00:30:31,057 --> 00:30:33,337
He got into the ward
with some cockamamie story,

565
00:30:33,377 --> 00:30:35,897
then he turned the place
upside down looking for you.

566
00:30:35,977 --> 00:30:37,857
He's got a knife
six inches long,
believe me.

567
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:40,055
What are you doing
on the phone?
Get him out of that ward.

568
00:30:40,135 --> 00:30:41,815
We did. We got him
in the shower room.

569
00:30:41,855 --> 00:30:43,695
Arkie and Gavoni are
holding the door shut.

570
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,775
Meanwhile, he's on
the other side
trying to bust out.

571
00:30:45,855 --> 00:30:47,095
There are three of
you and one of him.

572
00:30:47,175 --> 00:30:48,534
Get that knife
away from him.

573
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:50,614
Doc, that could
be dangerous.

574
00:30:50,694 --> 00:30:52,574
I know it's dangerous,
but you've got to do it.

575
00:30:52,614 --> 00:30:53,934
He might kill himself.

576
00:30:54,014 --> 00:30:56,374
If I try to take that
knife away from him,
he'll kill me.

577
00:30:57,214 --> 00:31:00,654
All right.
Hold him in the shower
till I get there. Right?

578
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,494
Jake! Jake!

579
00:31:04,214 --> 00:31:06,254
Let me out of here!
Damn you.

580
00:31:06,814 --> 00:31:08,454
(SHOUTING)

581
00:31:08,974 --> 00:31:10,814
Doc said
take away the knife.

582
00:31:10,854 --> 00:31:12,654
Who?
He didn't say.

583
00:31:14,371 --> 00:31:16,771
All right, all right!
I'm elected. Let go.
Are you sure?

584
00:31:16,851 --> 00:31:19,171
No, I'm not sure,
you dumbhead.

585
00:31:20,251 --> 00:31:22,771
All right!
One, two, let go.

586
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:23,891
Pigs!

587
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,051
(GRUNTING)

588
00:31:53,408 --> 00:31:54,728
(MEN GROANING)

589
00:32:07,247 --> 00:32:08,567
Pharmacy key.

590
00:32:13,447 --> 00:32:15,007
KOPP: Come on.
Everybody, get back.
Come on.

591
00:32:15,087 --> 00:32:16,847
Back in your beds.
Come on.

592
00:32:19,927 --> 00:32:22,167
Doc, look at this baby.

593
00:32:22,247 --> 00:32:24,647
I better go in with you,
that Bliss is as strong
as an ox.

594
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:25,685
Bleeding to death,
I'm not.

595
00:32:25,765 --> 00:32:27,445
You just wait here.

596
00:32:33,524 --> 00:32:37,084
You... You filthy,
scheming meddler.

597
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,764
I'll kill you,
kill you, kill you...

598
00:32:38,804 --> 00:32:41,004
You are not gonna
kill anyone,
do you hear me?

599
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,284
Where the devil do
you think you are?

600
00:32:42,324 --> 00:32:43,644
In some jungle
free-for-all?

601
00:32:43,724 --> 00:32:45,764
What do you mean,
coming in here
endangering my men?

602
00:32:45,844 --> 00:32:47,724
Who asked you to
meddle in my life?

603
00:32:47,764 --> 00:32:50,084
Who gave you
the right to probe
and to spy on me?

604
00:32:50,164 --> 00:32:52,164
You did.
By your actions.

605
00:32:52,244 --> 00:32:53,923
Take a good look
at yourself, Colonel,

606
00:32:54,003 --> 00:32:57,003
and then tell me
I did the wrong thing.
Look at yourself.

607
00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:59,763
Is this what
you would have
done overseas?

608
00:33:01,241 --> 00:33:03,081
Damn your eyes.

609
00:33:03,121 --> 00:33:07,481
God shrivel your heart
and consume your
monstrous brain.

610
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:12,521
You're vile.
Vile! Vile! Vile!
Vicious contempt.

611
00:33:12,561 --> 00:33:14,281
Get hold of yourself.

612
00:33:14,801 --> 00:33:16,281
Remember who you are.

613
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,760
You are Colonel
Norval Algate Bliss.

614
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,120
A command officer.
Remember that.

615
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,840
Colonel Norval Algate Bliss.

616
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,520
Now behave yourself.

617
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,800
Put your arms down, Colonel.

618
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,078
Put your arms down.

619
00:33:50,397 --> 00:33:52,517
You swine. You...

620
00:33:53,717 --> 00:33:57,757
You clever,
scheming swine.

621
00:34:01,317 --> 00:34:03,077
Take it easy, Colonel.

622
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,677
You need lots of sleep.

623
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:07,916
Why do you fight me?
Here we go.

624
00:34:07,996 --> 00:34:09,436
Let's get to bed.
Right now.
Into bed. Into bed.

625
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:10,636
Peppy.

626
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,274
All right. Show's over.

627
00:34:13,354 --> 00:34:14,994
Everybody back to bed.

628
00:34:15,074 --> 00:34:16,914
Okay, Doc.
That's all.

629
00:34:17,674 --> 00:34:18,594
All right.

630
00:34:19,354 --> 00:34:21,674
You better have Blodgett
take a look at that cut
and hit the sack.

631
00:34:21,754 --> 00:34:22,794
I'm on duty, Doc.

632
00:34:22,874 --> 00:34:24,034
Well, get Ruskin
to relieve you.

633
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:26,714
I'm relieved
enough already.
Come on, Stan.

634
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,153
I suppose you...

635
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:44,993
You had to shout
at him like that.

636
00:34:45,993 --> 00:34:48,471
I wasn't shouting at him,

637
00:34:48,551 --> 00:34:50,751
I was shouting
at his symptoms.

638
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,470
Good night, Doc.

639
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,430
Good night, Ralph.
Everything's fine.

640
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,630
Mama? Mama, please
get me out of here.
Hello, Dave.

641
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,550
Hello, Dave.
Mama, please.

642
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,310
Mama. Please, Mama.
Get me out of here.

643
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,830
Did you write to your
girlfriend today, Dave?

644
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,790
Please, Mama.
Get me out of here.
Mama, Mama, please.

645
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:21,470
Did you write to
your girlfriend today?

646
00:35:22,107 --> 00:35:24,827
You said you would.
Did you write to her?

647
00:35:27,547 --> 00:35:28,667
Yeah.

648
00:35:29,187 --> 00:35:30,907
Yes, the same
old malarkey.

649
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:32,267
(LAUGHING)

650
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,027
Same old malarkey.

651
00:35:34,107 --> 00:35:36,427
Well, why don't you
write to her again
tomorrow, huh?

652
00:35:36,507 --> 00:35:37,747
NEWMAN: Give her a break.

653
00:35:37,827 --> 00:35:38,787
DAVE: Okay.

654
00:35:39,547 --> 00:35:40,467
Good night, Dave.

655
00:35:40,547 --> 00:35:42,307
Good night, Doctor.
Good night.

656
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,300
GAVONl: This way, fellows.

657
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,100
Can you spare four beds
and a room, Lieutenant?

658
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,020
I think so.
Good. Here.

659
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,860
Come on. Straight ahead,
fellow. Everybody's your
friend here.

660
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,140
Just follow your buddy
in there. It's okay.

661
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,660
Straight ahead.

662
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,779
Come on, buddy.
Nothing to worry about.
Straight ahead.

663
00:37:15,217 --> 00:37:16,937
Room C, Arkie.
All right.

664
00:37:24,057 --> 00:37:25,577
Jordan is scheduled
for pentothal at 2:00.

665
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:27,096
Okay.

666
00:37:31,576 --> 00:37:32,856
Do you want me to
give you the rest
of the scam

667
00:37:32,936 --> 00:37:34,096
on that kid in Ward 3?

668
00:37:34,176 --> 00:37:37,496
Leibowitz, it's not part
of an orderly's duties
to run around the hospital

669
00:37:37,536 --> 00:37:38,896
drumming up new business.

670
00:37:38,936 --> 00:37:41,976
From such business, who,
but the sick, can profit?

671
00:37:43,576 --> 00:37:45,494
His name is Tompkins.

672
00:37:45,574 --> 00:37:46,894
He's a corporal, like me.

673
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:49,334
Now, for five nights
in a row, he has
snuck out of his ward

674
00:37:49,414 --> 00:37:51,053
and got himself plastered.

675
00:37:51,093 --> 00:37:53,653
They seem to think
they've got an ordinary
lush on their hands,

676
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:57,813
but in my opinion,
he is a disturbed
personality.

677
00:37:57,893 --> 00:38:00,773
Cocky, but tense.
But he doesn't fool me.

678
00:38:00,853 --> 00:38:05,133
My diagnosis is
depression, agitated,
troublemaker.

679
00:38:05,853 --> 00:38:07,333
Well, I hope you
didn't tell him that.

680
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:09,213
Maybe I'm fresh.
Stupid, no.

681
00:38:09,293 --> 00:38:10,693
What I did tell him,
though, was to come over

682
00:38:10,773 --> 00:38:12,173
and take a load off
his emotions and see you.

683
00:38:12,253 --> 00:38:14,333
Boy, did I give you
a terrific recommendation.

684
00:38:14,413 --> 00:38:17,852
Thanks. Young doctor
starting out needs
all the help he can get.

685
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:56,007
Say, I thought
I told you to shave.

686
00:38:56,087 --> 00:38:57,287
I beg your pardon, Captain.

687
00:38:57,367 --> 00:38:59,287
What you said was,
"Why didn't you
shave this morning?"

688
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:00,647
That's not an order.
That's a question.

689
00:39:00,687 --> 00:39:02,887
To which you have
an answer which
I've already heard,

690
00:39:02,927 --> 00:39:05,406
"If God had intended
men should have
clean cheeks,

691
00:39:05,486 --> 00:39:08,366
"would he have
invented hair?"
Shave.

692
00:39:10,286 --> 00:39:11,526
I understand, Doc.

693
00:39:11,606 --> 00:39:13,366
You are releasing
your hostilities on me.

694
00:39:13,446 --> 00:39:14,606
Very good.
I want you to do it

695
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,046
because I don't want you
should develop an ulcer.

696
00:39:16,126 --> 00:39:18,726
I don't want you
should develop a beard.

697
00:39:20,686 --> 00:39:24,646
You'd better get into
the ward. Bliss has
started to move and talk.

698
00:39:27,726 --> 00:39:28,686
When did it happen?

699
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,563
Must have been in
the last hour or so.

700
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:35,523
I pulled Blodgett's
morning report.

701
00:39:35,563 --> 00:39:36,963
"Sixteenth day
of observation,

702
00:39:37,003 --> 00:39:39,403
"patient still lethargic,
still refuses to speak."

703
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:42,243
We'll need 15 replacements
for operational aircraft.

704
00:39:42,283 --> 00:39:45,723
Recent strikes at Rabal
suggest that a monthly quota
be set up for this unit.

705
00:39:45,803 --> 00:39:48,603
Ground personnel is
adequate but borderline.

706
00:39:49,283 --> 00:39:52,803
I granted no appointment
for this hour. Dismissed.

707
00:39:53,123 --> 00:39:54,163
(CHUCKLES)

708
00:39:54,243 --> 00:39:56,802
I'm dismissed before
I've even come in.

709
00:40:02,002 --> 00:40:04,562
Oh, the caduceus.

710
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,280
You're a doctor.

711
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,320
I'm Captain Newman.

712
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,480
And from my dreary abode,
I conclude that

713
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,080
you're one of
the perceptive ones
who babble brightly.

714
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,000
You see, Doctor,
I'm thoroughly conversed
with your psychiatric jargon.

715
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,120
Please, do come in.
Come in.

716
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:27,039
Well, proceed.

717
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:29,479
This should be refreshing.
I'm bored, Doctor.

718
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:31,399
I am bored with
being beleaguered

719
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:33,279
by brainless,
benighted blockheads.

720
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,359
And I'm bored with B's.

721
00:40:34,439 --> 00:40:37,439
I think I shall
concentrate on P's for
the rest of the afternoon.

722
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:41,517
How do you feel?

723
00:40:41,677 --> 00:40:43,157
(CLICKING TONGUE)

724
00:40:43,237 --> 00:40:45,916
Standard opening.
You disappoint me.

725
00:40:46,596 --> 00:40:48,516
Have you no imagination?

726
00:40:49,356 --> 00:40:50,876
I'm holding it in reserve.

727
00:40:50,956 --> 00:40:52,436
You've got enough
for both of us, Colonel.

728
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,076
Colonel? Colonel?

729
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:59,316
My name is Future,
not Colonel.

730
00:41:01,756 --> 00:41:02,876
I see.

731
00:41:03,556 --> 00:41:05,916
What a pity
Mr. Past is not here.

732
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:08,156
He'd be
amused by you.

733
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:11,675
Mr. Past. Who's he?

734
00:41:12,355 --> 00:41:13,635
He's a friend.

735
00:41:13,715 --> 00:41:16,115
A very close,
very special friend.

736
00:41:17,033 --> 00:41:19,153
I gave my word, sir,
as an officer
and a gentleman,

737
00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:21,353
never to reveal
his whereabouts.

738
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:24,073
Lips sealed.

739
00:41:24,153 --> 00:41:28,113
Ergo, in your hospital,
you have me, Mr. Future,

740
00:41:28,193 --> 00:41:30,233
about whom
you know nothing,

741
00:41:30,953 --> 00:41:32,873
while in your files
rests a dossier

742
00:41:32,953 --> 00:41:35,192
on Mr. Past,
who is nowhere to be found.

743
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,872
One patient with
no case history,

744
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,592
one case history
with no patient.

745
00:41:38,672 --> 00:41:39,752
(LAUGHING)

746
00:41:39,832 --> 00:41:42,472
What a paradox?
No. What a triumph.

747
00:41:47,552 --> 00:41:48,592
Well,

748
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,470
I can see that
we're just wasting time.

749
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,990
Oh, no, now please,
don't go.

750
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,670
I'm enjoying your visit.

751
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,910
Well, I don't doubt it,
but, you see, I didn't
come here

752
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,949
for the purpose
of providing

753
00:42:01,029 --> 00:42:04,429
a patronizing patient
with a plethora of
private pleasure.

754
00:42:04,509 --> 00:42:08,629
Bravo, bravo, seven P's.

755
00:42:10,909 --> 00:42:12,749
Is Mr. Future mad, sir?

756
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:19,349
I repeat.
Is Mr. Future mad?

757
00:42:19,429 --> 00:42:21,749
Or is he not mad?

758
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:30,706
Mr. Future is
an invention.

759
00:42:31,746 --> 00:42:33,426
Bless my soul.

760
00:42:33,506 --> 00:42:37,066
Oh, penetrating prophet
of the psyche.

761
00:42:40,066 --> 00:42:41,426
Is he incurable?

762
00:42:41,466 --> 00:42:44,666
I can't tell yet.
You see, most people

763
00:42:44,746 --> 00:42:47,226
talk to reveal.
You talk to conceal.

764
00:42:47,306 --> 00:42:48,746
But to a good psychiatrist,

765
00:42:48,826 --> 00:42:51,985
isn't the act of concealment
very revealing in itself?

766
00:42:53,065 --> 00:42:56,745
Mr. Future,
you're too intelligent a man

767
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:59,785
to spend the rest
of your days in
a mental hospital.

768
00:43:07,663 --> 00:43:09,103
Is that likely?

769
00:43:09,743 --> 00:43:14,982
That's what usually
happens when people
split themselves in two.

770
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:30,862
Daylight recon
flights will continue.

771
00:43:30,902 --> 00:43:33,102
Lieutenants Bergman,
Brady, Oswald,

772
00:43:33,182 --> 00:43:35,342
Reinhardt will
patrol Sector A.

773
00:43:35,462 --> 00:43:38,939
Sector B,
Lieutenants Grace,
Newhouse,

774
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:40,339
Captains Moore and Leary.

775
00:43:40,419 --> 00:43:42,379
Oh, Jackson.

776
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:44,019
Can you get a hold of
one of those radio techs

777
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:46,099
and have him wire
this room for playback?

778
00:43:46,179 --> 00:43:48,779
I want to know everything
that Bliss says.

779
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:51,659
Okay.
Oh, and tell him yourself.

780
00:44:01,499 --> 00:44:02,619
The light seemed
to bother him.

781
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:05,258
He's more comfortable
this way.

782
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:20,576
Paul

783
00:44:24,016 --> 00:44:25,096

784
00:44:28,136 --> 00:44:29,055
Winston.

785
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:32,695
Tired.

786
00:44:43,255 --> 00:44:44,935
Captain Winston.

787
00:44:48,695 --> 00:44:51,333
Paul? Paul.

788
00:45:26,969 --> 00:45:28,809
It's happened before.

789
00:45:28,889 --> 00:45:32,489
Once at the evac hospital,
he went to sleep
for three days.

790
00:45:33,209 --> 00:45:36,769
His case file is on your desk,
but it doesn't give you
much to go on.

791
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:38,729
His plane crash-landed
in France.

792
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,449
Missing in action 13 months.

793
00:45:41,409 --> 00:45:43,688
Liberating forces
found him in a cellar.

794
00:45:44,488 --> 00:45:47,008
He identified himself
and blacked out.

795
00:45:58,328 --> 00:46:01,086
The evac N.P. Tried shock,
then pentothal.

796
00:46:01,126 --> 00:46:03,646
Negative. He can't
or won't respond.

797
00:46:04,206 --> 00:46:05,686
Anything from
French locals?

798
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:07,246
Nothing in the report.

799
00:46:07,326 --> 00:46:08,725
He was 13 months
in a cellar.

800
00:46:08,805 --> 00:46:10,325
That's all there is.

801
00:46:12,685 --> 00:46:16,645
Oh, Francie,
Leibowitz thinks
we have another customer.

802
00:46:16,725 --> 00:46:18,645
Check on a boy
named Tompkins, Ward 3.

803
00:46:18,725 --> 00:46:19,885
Mmm-hmm.

804
00:46:22,285 --> 00:46:23,805
Which one is he?

805
00:46:24,445 --> 00:46:26,445
Just take a look
and guess.

806
00:46:26,965 --> 00:46:29,765
He's all yours,
if you want him.
Bed eight.

807
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:32,405
Thanks, Katie.

808
00:46:32,485 --> 00:46:33,724

FRANCIE: Evening, Corporal.

814
00:46:57,082 --> 00:46:58,801
I'm Lieutenant Corum.

815
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:03,521
Well, how are you,
beautiful?

816
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:05,361
Are you gonna
take care of me?

817
00:47:05,801 --> 00:47:08,041
No. I'm in Ward 7.

818
00:47:09,281 --> 00:47:10,759
Hurray for you.

819
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:13,519
How are you
coming along here?

820
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,039
I've been in worse places.

821
00:47:16,279 --> 00:47:17,959
Well, is there
anything you need?

822
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:19,159
Yeah.

823
00:47:19,439 --> 00:47:21,799
Some cheaper booze
and some juicier broads.

824
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:26,278
In that order?

825
00:47:30,478 --> 00:47:33,158
Okay, so you don't
shock easy in Ward 7.

826
00:47:33,598 --> 00:47:35,518
Big deal.

827
00:47:35,598 --> 00:47:36,918
First it was that
Corporal Leibowitz.

828
00:47:36,998 --> 00:47:38,678
Now it's you.

829
00:47:39,118 --> 00:47:40,278
Maybe you're prettier
than he is, ma'am,

830
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:42,478
but I'm gonna give it to
you like I gave it to him.

831
00:47:42,558 --> 00:47:45,038
You tell Captain Newman
I said to shove it.

832
00:47:45,758 --> 00:47:48,035
Ain't nobody gonna
slap no needle in me.

833
00:47:51,395 --> 00:47:53,555
It's getting
a little crowded in here.

834
00:47:53,595 --> 00:47:55,595
I think I'm gonna go
for a walk.

838

Tompkins' file.
And a message for you,

"Shove it."

840
00:48:19,994 --> 00:48:21,474
Sounds rude.

841
00:48:21,592 --> 00:48:23,112
I can't read him.

842
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:24,712
I don't know
if there's anything
wrong with him

843
00:48:24,792 --> 00:48:27,352
or if he's trying to
live up to his reputation
as a stinker.

844

Severe
gastrointestinal pains.

845

Insomnia.
He's 20 years old?
Mmm-hmm.

846
00:48:38,031 --> 00:48:39,991
Something wrong
with him, all right.

847
00:48:40,071 --> 00:48:41,671
In that case,
you'd better drop by
and see him.

848
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:43,311
I'm sure
he won't come here.

849
00:48:43,351 --> 00:48:44,911
I can't help him
unless he comes to me.

850
00:48:44,991 --> 00:48:46,311
If I go to him,
I'm the weaker.

851
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:49,871
Lost him
before I start.
It's his move.

852
00:48:49,951 --> 00:48:52,031
Now help me with
these names, will you?

853
00:48:52,111 --> 00:48:55,711
Joe, you don't intend
to write to everybody
Bliss mentions?

854
00:48:57,189 --> 00:48:59,109
Now I've written to
the Senior Air Surgeon
in New Guinea,

855
00:48:59,189 --> 00:49:01,589
and asked him to talk
to all the people who
were close to Bliss.

856
00:49:01,669 --> 00:49:05,348
The key to his split is
somewhere in his past.

857
00:49:05,428 --> 00:49:08,588
So, if I can't get it
from him, I have to go
elsewhere.

858
00:49:08,668 --> 00:49:11,628
Now, is this third name
McDonnell or MacDonald?

859
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:13,828
<i>BLISS: To include
Captains Trabert,
Adler, McDonnell,</i>

860
00:49:13,908 --> 00:49:15,068
<i>Lieutenants Jacobs
and Hassmiller.</i>

Leibowitz.
Later!

863
00:49:22,988 --> 00:49:24,508
It's Gavoni.
Gavoni?

864
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:26,748
He's outside!
He must've found out.

865
00:49:27,787 --> 00:49:28,987
(SHUSHING)
Now, wait a minute, fellas.

866
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:31,307
We've got a small
crisis on our hands.
Now, let's deal with it.

867
00:49:31,347 --> 00:49:34,025
Everybody go back to
their places. Go ahead.

868
00:49:34,785 --> 00:49:37,185
When I find my salami,
I'm gonna make...

869
00:49:37,745 --> 00:49:38,745
Go.

870
00:49:39,665 --> 00:49:42,465
Up the sleeve.
Good boy.

871
00:49:45,425 --> 00:49:46,985
Leibowitz!
LEIBOWITZ: Hi, Gavoni.

872
00:49:47,065 --> 00:49:48,905
Don't "Hi, Gavoni" me.

873
00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:50,745
Somebody stole my salami.

874
00:49:51,984 --> 00:49:54,624
Are you accusing
one of my patients
of being a crook?

875
00:49:54,704 --> 00:49:56,104
I ain't accusing them.

876
00:49:56,144 --> 00:49:58,024
These men are
in the service
of their country.

877
00:49:58,064 --> 00:49:59,464
I know who took it.

878
00:49:59,504 --> 00:50:02,024
One of these men
may turn out to be
another Eisenhower.

879
00:50:02,104 --> 00:50:05,744
Leibowitz, I want that
salami and I ain't kidding.

880
00:50:06,544 --> 00:50:08,462
Now, will you take it easy?
Now, to begin with,

881
00:50:08,542 --> 00:50:10,662
are you sure
you had a salami?

882
00:50:10,702 --> 00:50:13,062
Gavoni had a salami!
My sister sent it to me!

883
00:50:13,102 --> 00:50:15,502
She sends me one
every week without fail.

884
00:50:15,582 --> 00:50:17,501
Well, in that case,
why don't you check
with the post office?

885
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:18,621
Have them put
a tracer on it.

886
00:50:18,701 --> 00:50:19,861
I don't need no tracer.

887
00:50:19,941 --> 00:50:21,221
That salami's right
here in this room.

888
00:50:21,261 --> 00:50:23,501
And what's more,
it was stolen.

889
00:50:23,741 --> 00:50:25,101
(CLEARS THROAT)

890
00:50:25,621 --> 00:50:26,941
It was stolen, huh?
Yeah.

891
00:50:27,021 --> 00:50:29,661
Okay. Well, in that case,
we're gonna help you
find your man.

892
00:50:29,741 --> 00:50:31,301
Now let's start
at the very top.

893
00:50:31,341 --> 00:50:34,181
Do you think
Colonel Pyser
stole your salami?

894
00:50:34,221 --> 00:50:36,021
You know who stole it.
You did.

895
00:50:36,101 --> 00:50:37,861
Now, just a minute.
Don't try to back out.

896
00:50:37,941 --> 00:50:39,341
You already
accused these men.

897
00:50:39,421 --> 00:50:40,421
Who blamed
anybody in this...

898
00:50:40,501 --> 00:50:41,501
Don't try to
weasel out of this.

899
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:44,538
Did I blame anybody
in this room? Did I?

900
00:50:44,618 --> 00:50:46,298
The damage is done.

901
00:50:46,378 --> 00:50:49,578
You've already thrown
the whole ward into
a trauma. Right, men?

902
00:50:49,658 --> 00:50:50,978
(ALL SHOUTING)

903
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:52,578
All right, all right!

904
00:50:52,618 --> 00:50:54,138
I've heard it
a thousand times.

905
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:56,458
Gavoni, that's
very bad psychology.

906
00:50:56,538 --> 00:50:58,058
You've given everybody
a guilt complex.

907
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,578
The least you could do
is apologize.

908
00:50:59,658 --> 00:51:01,898
Now apologize.
Come on.

909
00:51:01,978 --> 00:51:03,098
All right. I'm sorry.

910
00:51:03,178 --> 00:51:04,578
Words, words.
Nothing but words.
Sorry.

911
00:51:04,658 --> 00:51:06,498
Gavoni, if you're
really sorry, show it.

912
00:51:06,538 --> 00:51:07,537
How?

913
00:51:07,617 --> 00:51:09,337
Share your salami
with these men.

914
00:51:09,417 --> 00:51:11,577
How can I share
a salami I don't have?

915
00:51:11,657 --> 00:51:14,617
Gavoni, Gavoni.

916
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:17,097
That's beside the point.
Let's get to the meat
of the question.

917
00:51:17,177 --> 00:51:18,815
Would you share it?

918
00:51:21,655 --> 00:51:23,015
Yeah.
Good!

919
00:51:23,735 --> 00:51:24,855
Okay, men,
you heard Gavoni.

920
00:51:24,935 --> 00:51:26,215
He's gonna share
the salami.

921
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:27,735
So let's give him
a hand and find it.

922
00:51:27,815 --> 00:51:29,895
Arkie, no one leaves
this ward till we find
that salami.

923
00:51:29,975 --> 00:51:31,454
Men, let's look!
Under the beds,

924
00:51:31,534 --> 00:51:33,694
in the pillowcases,
check your pockets.

925
00:51:33,734 --> 00:51:34,854
<i>Remember Lost Weekend?</i>

926
00:51:34,934 --> 00:51:36,334
Check the fixtures.
Come on, let's go!

927
00:51:36,414 --> 00:51:38,494
Everybody, look!
Look under the beds.

928
00:51:38,534 --> 00:51:40,574
Look in the pillowcases.
Let's find it!

929
00:51:40,654 --> 00:51:42,614
I found it!
That's it.

930
00:51:42,694 --> 00:51:45,374
Now just a minute, Gavoni.
Just a minute.

931
00:51:45,974 --> 00:51:47,734
Gavoni, are you sure
this is your salami?

932
00:51:47,814 --> 00:51:49,054
It's a Genoese.

933
00:51:49,094 --> 00:51:51,134
(ALL LAUGHING)
It's your salami.

934
00:51:51,214 --> 00:51:52,974
See. All that fuss,
all that screaming?

935
00:51:53,054 --> 00:51:54,412
No one stole
your salami, Gavoni.

936
00:51:54,492 --> 00:51:56,531
You lost it.
Butterfingers.

937
00:51:56,611 --> 00:51:58,971
How could I lose
a salami in somebody's
bathrobe?

938
00:51:59,011 --> 00:52:03,771
Gavoni, may I remind you
of a cardinal rule in
the field of psychiatry?

939
00:52:03,811 --> 00:52:05,731
In the words of
Sigmund Freud,

940
00:52:05,811 --> 00:52:08,371
"Show me a man that
can lose his temper

941
00:52:08,411 --> 00:52:10,931
"and I'll show you a man
that can lose his salami."

943
00:52:15,451 --> 00:52:17,851
Gavoni, come here.

944
00:52:20,611 --> 00:52:21,810
Start cutting.

945
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:27,250
Do you mind?

946
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:29,010
Oh, by the way, Gavoni.
Yeah?

947
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:31,088
I promised Bobby
the first slice.

the middle's mine.

950
00:52:34,928 --> 00:52:37,208

to your sister.

952
00:52:39,808 --> 00:52:43,128
Thank you, Doctor.
Oh, excuse me.

953
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:46,127
This came this morning.
I think it's for you.

00:52:47,727 --> 00:52:49,567
"Big shot, cuckoo squad."

955
00:52:51,847 --> 00:52:53,567
That's me, all right.

956
00:52:54,767 --> 00:52:56,407
It's from Tompkins.

957
00:52:57,847 --> 00:53:00,687
He wants me to
meet him tonight
in the rec hall.

958
00:53:00,767 --> 00:53:02,967
In my opinion,
Tompkins...

959
00:53:03,807 --> 00:53:05,245
I leave it entirely
in your hands.

960
00:53:05,325 --> 00:53:07,645
I have every confidence.
Excuse me.

961
00:53:09,725 --> 00:53:10,964
At 11:00.

962
00:53:22,684 --> 00:53:24,884
Hey, douse the light,
will you, Doc?

963
00:53:24,964 --> 00:53:27,084
It's all right.
Come on in.

964
00:53:27,124 --> 00:53:29,404
They gig me
if they find me.

965
00:53:29,484 --> 00:53:30,924
I'll take care of that.

966
00:53:34,204 --> 00:53:35,164
Okay.

967
00:53:51,281 --> 00:53:53,361
You know something, Doc?

968
00:53:53,401 --> 00:53:55,321
A man should
never drink alone.

969
00:53:56,561 --> 00:53:58,641
It turns him
into an alcoholic.

970
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:01,000
Have a shot.
All right.

971
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,200
Oh, no,
I brung you a cup.

972
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,520
You're an officer
and a gentleman.

973
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,080
No gentleman should ever
drink from a bottle.

974
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,998
But you better drink it fast
before it rots the paper.

975
00:54:23,238 --> 00:54:24,438
Tompkins,

976
00:54:26,677 --> 00:54:28,317
this stuff won't turn
you into an alcoholic.

977
00:54:28,397 --> 00:54:30,157
It'll turn you
into a corpse.

978
00:54:30,397 --> 00:54:31,517
Not me, Doc.

979
00:54:32,797 --> 00:54:34,477
Why, me and Big Jim,

980
00:54:34,557 --> 00:54:37,477
we used to knock off
a couple of these
pints every night.

981
00:54:40,077 --> 00:54:42,757
Turn the light out, Doc.
Just turn it out!

982
00:54:48,117 --> 00:54:49,517
You know something?

983
00:54:50,596 --> 00:54:52,794
Big Jim was the only buddy
I ever had.

984
00:54:54,474 --> 00:54:56,914
Only guy ever treated
Little Jim real good.

985
00:54:57,634 --> 00:54:59,754
Yeah. And you know
what I done?

986
00:55:03,154 --> 00:55:04,394
(SOBBING)
Don't let me...

987
00:55:04,714 --> 00:55:06,874
Don't let me
talk no more, Doc.

988
00:55:07,194 --> 00:55:09,354
If I talk,
I'll blow my top.

989
00:55:09,394 --> 00:55:12,434
I'll just smash the lamps
and throw the chairs around.

990
00:55:12,514 --> 00:55:14,914
I'm gonna pump my fists
right through
the glass in the window.

991
00:55:14,994 --> 00:55:16,233
Sure, sure.

992
00:55:17,993 --> 00:55:21,313
You throw the chairs around,
you put your fists through
all the glass,

993
00:55:21,393 --> 00:55:24,713
and it won't do you
a bit of good. Not one bit
and you know it.

994
00:55:25,713 --> 00:55:29,271
Now, why don't you
get it off your chest
once and for all?

995
00:55:31,271 --> 00:55:34,191
Come on. What happened?

996
00:55:34,271 --> 00:55:36,031
I'm in a sweat, Doc.

997
00:55:37,991 --> 00:55:39,871
I don't want
to talk about it.

998
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:43,710
Oh, God, I don't...

999
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:46,470
I don't even want
to think about it.

1000
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:50,470
I'll bet you are
thinking about it
all the time.

1001
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:53,110
Day and night,
week after week.

1002
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,230
You play the guitar
to use up your thoughts.

1003
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:58,150
You fight off sleep
so you won't dream.

1004
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,670
You get swacked to
run away from memory.

1005
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:04,188
That's a stupid
way to live.

1006
00:56:04,268 --> 00:56:06,227
That's a damned
stupid way to live.

1007
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:25,747
Doc, you gimme
the flak juice.

1008
00:56:28,267 --> 00:56:31,346
I'm asking for it.
Give it to me now.

1009
00:56:32,026 --> 00:56:34,226
Right now.

1010
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,864
Okay. You lay off the booze
for a couple of days.

1011
00:56:40,744 --> 00:56:42,624
Not a drop,
you understand?

1012
00:56:42,664 --> 00:56:44,904
I'll tell them
to stop medication.

1013
00:56:45,024 --> 00:56:47,304
And more pills
to help you sleep.

1014
00:56:48,064 --> 00:56:49,864
Then we'll give you
the flak.

1015
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,183
You mean you ain't gonna
give it to me now?

1016
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,223
I mean, when I'm
asking for it?

1017
00:56:57,303 --> 00:56:59,223
Nope. It'll hold.

1018
00:57:07,543 --> 00:57:10,303
Well, if you ain't
gonna give it to me now,

1019
00:57:12,503 --> 00:57:14,301
well, you can forget it.

1020
00:57:14,341 --> 00:57:16,141
In fact, you can shove it.

1021
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:20,940
Boy, they sure picked
the right guy to boss
the loony squad, didn't they?

1022
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,060
Yeah.

1023
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,060
All right, Jim,
you can roll up
your sleeve now.

1024
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,540
I'll do that.

1025
00:57:44,659 --> 00:57:46,459
Boy, that's a hot one.

1026
00:57:46,499 --> 00:57:48,537
Two officers
putting me to bed.

1027
00:57:49,457 --> 00:57:51,177
Say, is it all right if
I take off my shoes, Doc?

1028
00:57:51,257 --> 00:57:53,097
Sure.

1029
00:57:53,177 --> 00:57:57,577
I kind of sleep
better without them.

1030
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,817
That's all I'm gonna do,
isn't it, Doc? Just sleep?

1031
00:58:01,857 --> 00:58:03,217
That's right.

1032
00:58:10,136 --> 00:58:11,896
Hey, that's enough, Doc.

1033
00:58:11,976 --> 00:58:13,696
I don't want to
wake up an old man.

1034
00:58:22,136 --> 00:58:24,174
All right, Jim.
Here we go.

1035
00:58:28,134 --> 00:58:30,534
Now, this'll
make you drowsy.

1036
00:58:30,614 --> 00:58:32,334
When I tell you
to start counting,

1037
00:58:32,374 --> 00:58:34,413
start counting,
but backward from 100.

1038
00:58:34,453 --> 00:58:35,733
Have you got that?

1039
00:58:35,893 --> 00:58:37,173
Backwards from 100.

1040
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:45,933
100, 99...

1041
00:58:46,453 --> 00:58:49,133
100, 99,

1042
00:58:49,653 --> 00:58:50,853
98.

1043
00:58:51,933 --> 00:58:54,173
It's hot.
Feels hot, Doc.

1044
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:56,533
100, 99...

1045
00:58:57,493 --> 00:59:03,810
100, 99, 98, 97,

1046
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:07,770
96...

1047
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:13,970
It sure is getting hot, Doc.

1048
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,130
Five.

1049
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,770
Four. 97.

1050
00:59:26,049 --> 00:59:27,769
NEWMAN:
That's all right, now.

1051
00:59:28,689 --> 00:59:30,569
Let that old
prop wash hit you.

1052
00:59:33,489 --> 00:59:35,087
Yeah, that's better.

1053
00:59:37,487 --> 00:59:40,047
I'm getting wind off
number two inboard.

1054
00:59:40,687 --> 00:59:44,407
94, 93,

1055
00:59:49,486 --> 00:59:52,126
92...

1056
00:59:53,646 --> 00:59:54,846
All right, Jim.

1057
00:59:57,606 --> 00:59:58,926
Come on now, Jim.

1058
01:00:00,566 --> 01:00:03,246
You're gonna take us
for a ride.

1059
01:00:03,286 --> 01:00:05,566
Come on, boy.

1060
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:10,604
Tuesday, November 17, 18:05.

1061
01:00:11,564 --> 01:00:14,883
Come on, now.
Let's go, let's go.

1062
01:00:14,963 --> 01:00:18,563
Come on.
Can't keep a war waiting.

1063
01:00:18,643 --> 01:00:20,563
That's a sweat job.

1064
01:00:20,643 --> 01:00:22,563
Nothing to it.

1065
01:00:22,643 --> 01:00:23,923
Ride on over there

1066
01:00:24,003 --> 01:00:25,843
and drop a few
of them little old
firecrackers on them.

1067
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:28,363
Cream 'em, boy.

1068
01:00:29,523 --> 01:00:32,243
Okay, Big Jim.
Here goes.

1069
01:00:33,323 --> 01:00:35,003
Me and Buck in the waist,

1070
01:00:35,203 --> 01:00:37,563
Big Jim up front
with Lieutenant Bates.

1071
01:00:38,602 --> 01:00:41,522
Up, come on, get up.

1072
01:00:41,602 --> 01:00:45,082
Come on!
Get this two-bit coffin
off the ground, Big Jim!

1073
01:00:45,162 --> 01:00:48,680
Come on, get it up.
Hey, we're up now!

1074
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,040
(EXHALES)

1075
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,400
Waist to pilot.
Waist to pilot.

1076
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,120
You mind if I take me
a couple of practice blasts?

1077
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,320
Roger.

1078
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:08,999
Waist working okay. Over.

1079
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:11,919
Hey, Buck.
You and me gotta get us

1080
01:01:11,999 --> 01:01:13,839
a couple of broads
when we get back.

1081
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:17,279
Yeah, with builds on
'em that won't quit.

1082
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:19,719
I mean real
balloon smugglers.

1083
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,797
And they gotta
swing this time.

1084
01:01:21,877 --> 01:01:23,677
Not like that last time.

1085
01:01:24,117 --> 01:01:26,557
All them two wanted
to do was drink.

1086
01:01:26,637 --> 01:01:29,796
I don't sure like
what the war is
doing to dames.

1087
01:01:29,876 --> 01:01:32,396
They just want
to drink, that's all.

1088
01:01:33,276 --> 01:01:35,436
Hey, what's that, Buck?

1089
01:01:35,516 --> 01:01:37,916
Down there at 4 o'clock.
Coming at us now at 3.

1090
01:01:37,996 --> 01:01:40,356
No, at 2 o'clock.
It's a ME 109.

1091
01:01:41,956 --> 01:01:44,116
I got him.
Yeah, I got him.

1092
01:01:44,196 --> 01:01:46,076
Hey, he's going down, Buck!

1093
01:01:46,156 --> 01:01:47,676
Go ahead, now. Fry!

1094
01:01:47,716 --> 01:01:49,756
Fry! Burn, you Nazi! Fry!

1095
01:01:55,075 --> 01:01:57,433
Holy Jesus.
There's three more of 'em.

1096
01:02:00,313 --> 01:02:02,593
Hey, we're hit. Hey!

1097
01:02:03,273 --> 01:02:06,233
Oh, dear Jesus.
The oil! The oil!

1098
01:02:06,913 --> 01:02:08,593
(SCREAMING)

1099
01:02:10,113 --> 01:02:12,393
Buck! Hey, Buck!
We're going down!

1100
01:02:12,473 --> 01:02:14,353
Oh, God! Oh, God.
My dear Jesus.

1101
01:02:14,433 --> 01:02:16,273
Dear Jesus, save me.
Save me.

1102
01:02:16,353 --> 01:02:18,672
Oh, God,
don't let us crash, please!

1103
01:02:18,752 --> 01:02:20,832
I'll be good!
I'll be good!

1104
01:02:20,912 --> 01:02:22,992
I promise I'll be good.

1105
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,232
Big Jim, Big Jim,
bring it up.

1106
01:02:25,312 --> 01:02:27,712
We're gonna crash!
We're gonna crash!

1107
01:02:27,792 --> 01:02:33,030
Take it up, you crud!
Take it up!

1108
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:36,110
Get this up, dear God!
Don't let it crash!

1109
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:37,910
(SCREAMING)

1110
01:02:47,949 --> 01:02:50,709
Come on, Jim.
Come on. You're down.

1111
01:02:52,189 --> 01:02:54,669
It crashed.
You're in that plane.

1112
01:02:57,469 --> 01:03:00,989
Gotta get out here.
I gotta get out.

1113
01:03:01,429 --> 01:03:04,229
The escape hatch.
We gotta get out of here.

1114
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:07,547
Yeah, the escape hatch.

1115
01:03:07,946 --> 01:03:11,066
Hey, Buck!
Come on! Buck?

1116
01:03:11,106 --> 01:03:15,506
Oh, no, no, no.
He got... Oh, God!

1117
01:03:15,546 --> 01:03:20,786
He got no head!
Oh, God! God!

1118
01:03:20,866 --> 01:03:23,986
Oh, God, put back his head,
please!

1119
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:27,106
God! Somebody?
God, please!

1120
01:03:27,186 --> 01:03:29,506
Please put back his head.

1121
01:03:29,586 --> 01:03:32,346
He don't look right.

1122
01:03:35,105 --> 01:03:39,505
Oh, fire. Fire.
Oh, I gotta get out of here.

1123
01:03:39,545 --> 01:03:42,265
I gotta get out of here.

1124
01:03:44,063 --> 01:03:47,383
I'm out. Oh, God,
I'm out. Thank God.

1125
01:03:47,463 --> 01:03:49,943
Thank God. I'm out.

1126
01:03:52,303 --> 01:03:54,703
Who's yelling?
Who's yelling?

1127
01:03:54,783 --> 01:03:57,223
Big Jim? Big Jim?

1128
01:03:57,343 --> 01:04:00,142
Little Jim.
Little Jim, help me!

1129
01:04:00,182 --> 01:04:01,982
Little Jim, save me.

1130
01:04:02,062 --> 01:04:04,822
Oh, I gotta go back.
Gotta go back.

1131
01:04:04,902 --> 01:04:05,902
Go back and get him!

1132
01:04:05,982 --> 01:04:09,102
Go back and get him,
you yellow-belly.
No, run, run, run, run!

1133
01:04:09,182 --> 01:04:13,022
Yeah, run! Look out!

1134
01:04:14,182 --> 01:04:16,622
Look out.
Run, run, run.

1135
01:04:16,702 --> 01:04:22,260
Run! Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run!

1136
01:04:24,419 --> 01:04:30,019
Run! Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run!

1137
01:04:34,499 --> 01:04:36,579
(WAILING)

1138
01:05:56,772 --> 01:06:00,092
Hey, Doc,
I must've dozed off.

1139
01:06:01,851 --> 01:06:04,051
I sure feel good.

1140
01:06:04,171 --> 01:06:06,409
That's the best
I've slept in months.

1141
01:06:07,769 --> 01:06:10,409
Hey, Lieutenant.
What do you know?

1142
01:06:11,049 --> 01:06:13,169
You been here all night?

1143
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:23,489
Hey, Doc, did I gab
a lot in my sleep?

1144
01:06:23,569 --> 01:06:24,529
Uh-huh.

1145
01:06:28,328 --> 01:06:29,328
What did I say?

1146
01:06:29,408 --> 01:06:31,808
Oh, you guys all think
you're the worst.

1147
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:33,968
I'm not handing out
any prizes around here.

1148
01:06:34,048 --> 01:06:35,488
If I were,
you wouldn't have
a chance.

1149
01:06:35,528 --> 01:06:38,288
I was expecting stuff
that'd blow me right off
of that chair.

1150
01:06:38,368 --> 01:06:39,808
You're not even
in the running.

1151
01:06:39,848 --> 01:06:42,406
I've got guys in this ward
that make you look like
Little Orphan Annie.

1152
01:06:42,486 --> 01:06:44,886
I thought that...
Yeah, I know. I know.

1153
01:06:45,366 --> 01:06:47,246
But it'll hold.
I'll see you Monday,

1154
01:06:47,326 --> 01:06:49,766
same time, my office.
Come on, now.

1155
01:06:50,926 --> 01:06:53,845
Get your tail off of there.
Get some hot coffee
from Leibowitz.

1156
01:06:53,925 --> 01:06:57,605
Run around the track,
play volleyball.
I got work to do.

1157
01:07:07,845 --> 01:07:09,205
So that was
flak juice, huh?

1158
01:07:09,285 --> 01:07:10,205
Uh-huh.

1159
01:07:10,845 --> 01:07:12,165
Big deal.

1160
01:07:19,042 --> 01:07:22,242
Best shot I ever did get
from old Uncle Sam.

1161
01:07:22,322 --> 01:07:24,322
Beats booze.

1162
01:07:35,482 --> 01:07:38,162
NEWMAN: When they wake up,
they feel great.

1163
01:07:38,242 --> 01:07:40,442
And then your
problems begin.

1164
01:07:41,281 --> 01:07:43,801
Hell, I'm a doctor.
That's all.

1165
01:07:43,841 --> 01:07:45,921
They ask too much of me.

1166
01:07:47,241 --> 01:07:49,521
No. No, they don't.

1167
01:07:49,641 --> 01:07:51,959
Not when you think of
what we ask of them.

1168
01:07:52,879 --> 01:07:56,639
And they have to go up,
hang in the air,
and get shot at.

1169
01:07:57,919 --> 01:08:00,239
You don't get shot down
in a psychiatric ward.

1170
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:03,039
Nobody ever crashed
behind a desk.

1171
01:08:06,998 --> 01:08:09,878
But the boy on the cot.

1172
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:12,078
Should we send him back?

1173
01:08:12,238 --> 01:08:16,798
Should we make him well
and strong again?

1174
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:22,238
We protect the sick.

1175
01:08:22,278 --> 01:08:25,118
We feed them,
and we love them

1176
01:08:25,358 --> 01:08:26,996
and we keep them safe.

1177
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:29,916
Our job is to
make them well.

1178
01:08:29,956 --> 01:08:32,395
Well enough to go out
and be killed.

1179
01:08:38,555 --> 01:08:40,515
My God,
what an awful shame.

1180
01:09:17,592 --> 01:09:19,672
Kind of you
to drive me home.

1181
01:09:24,471 --> 01:09:25,791
All right.

1182
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:34,471
I... I thank you.
I thank you.

1183
01:09:36,151 --> 01:09:39,949
Thank you for
a lovely evening.

1184
01:09:54,548 --> 01:09:55,948
FRANCIE: Oh, Joe.

1185
01:10:56,022 --> 01:10:57,462
Joe, we'll be court-martialed.

1186
01:10:57,542 --> 01:10:59,502
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

1187
01:10:59,582 --> 01:11:02,621
There's a shortage
of doctors and nurses.

1188
01:11:02,701 --> 01:11:04,381
It's true.

1189
01:11:04,781 --> 01:11:07,421
Aren't you the fellow
who just fell off a jeep?

1190
01:11:07,501 --> 01:11:11,021
Yep. Remarkable,
isn't it?

1191
01:11:11,261 --> 01:11:13,701
Oh, you've got
a beautiful neck.

1192
01:11:37,098 --> 01:11:38,698
Good try, old man.

1193
01:11:58,217 --> 01:12:00,295
Tomorrow, around 2:00.

1194
01:12:03,935 --> 01:12:06,135
Excuse me, Captain.
I have Corporal Tompkins
in your office.

1195
01:12:06,215 --> 01:12:07,975
He's waiting for you.

1196
01:12:08,935 --> 01:12:10,615
Well, how's it gonna
look if you're late?

1197
01:12:10,695 --> 01:12:12,095
It's gonna look as if
you're not interested.

1198
01:12:12,175 --> 01:12:16,094
Like you don't care.
That can give a patient
a feeling of insecurity.

1199
01:12:16,174 --> 01:12:17,974
Yes, Leibowitz.
Thank you.

1200
01:12:18,054 --> 01:12:19,334
Thank you.

1201
01:12:21,334 --> 01:12:25,214
That Captain Winston,
I never saw a patient
look so sad.

1202
01:12:25,294 --> 01:12:28,614
You mustn't confuse sadness
with depression, Professor.

1203
01:12:28,654 --> 01:12:30,054
Is there a difference?

1204
01:12:30,094 --> 01:12:32,614
Looks, Leibowitz,
can be deceiving.

1205
01:12:32,694 --> 01:12:34,692
Can a man look sad
and still be happy?

1206
01:12:34,772 --> 01:12:35,972
Yes.
Example?

1207
01:12:36,052 --> 01:12:37,052
You.

1208
01:12:41,571 --> 01:12:44,531
Hi, Doc. I feel sharp
as a tack today.

1209
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:46,451
You talk.
I'll just listen.

1210
01:12:46,531 --> 01:12:48,331
I got nothing more
to say. Nothing.

1211
01:12:51,611 --> 01:12:53,971
Take your feet
off my desk, soldier.

1212
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:56,811
You heard me.

1213
01:12:59,611 --> 01:13:01,891
And sit up straight
in that chair.

1214
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:07,570
Take that cheap cigar
out of your mouth.

1215
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:09,490
Go on. Put it out.

1216
01:13:14,648 --> 01:13:17,408
Now don't ever pull
that act again on me,
Tompkins.

1217
01:13:17,488 --> 01:13:20,568
When you're in this room,
you'll show some respect
for me and for yourself.

1218
01:13:20,608 --> 01:13:22,728
I'm not gonna let you
cheapen any man
who did 34 missions

1219
01:13:22,808 --> 01:13:26,368
and who wears all those
decorations on his chest.
You understand?

1220
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:35,127
All right. Clam up.

1221
01:13:36,007 --> 01:13:38,967
I'm gonna help you
even if you fight me
every inch of the way.

1222
01:13:39,007 --> 01:13:42,207
I can be just as rough on you
as you are on yourself.

1223
01:13:43,647 --> 01:13:46,525
So every day for
the next couple of weeks,

1224
01:13:46,565 --> 01:13:48,445
we're gonna take off
the gloves

1225
01:13:48,525 --> 01:13:51,245
and give little Jim Tompkins
a real shellacking.

1226
01:13:52,125 --> 01:13:54,165
I ran out on him,
that's what I done.

1227
01:13:54,245 --> 01:13:55,644
I ran out on him
just like a punk chicken.

1228
01:13:55,724 --> 01:13:59,684
Oh, you were scared
when the plane crashed!
Who wouldn't be?

1229
01:13:59,764 --> 01:14:00,924
You panicked.

1230
01:14:00,964 --> 01:14:02,924
You ran for your life
just like any guy would.

1231
01:14:03,844 --> 01:14:05,284
But not Little Jim.

1232
01:14:05,364 --> 01:14:06,764
He's not allowed
to be human, is he?

1233
01:14:06,844 --> 01:14:09,244
I should have gone back.
Holy mother of God.

1234
01:14:09,324 --> 01:14:10,564
That was Big Jim
in there

1235
01:14:10,644 --> 01:14:12,324
and I just should have
gone back and pulled him out.

1236
01:14:12,404 --> 01:14:14,204
What makes you
so sure that you could've
pulled him out?

1237
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:16,244
The plane would
still have exploded.

1238
01:14:16,284 --> 01:14:18,524
And you'd have been
blown up into those pieces
that nobody ever found.

1239
01:14:18,564 --> 01:14:19,923
Just like Big Jim.

1240
01:14:20,801 --> 01:14:22,801
You could've avoided
the whole mess
we're in right now

1241
01:14:22,881 --> 01:14:25,201
by the simple process
of getting yourself
blown up.

1242
01:14:25,241 --> 01:14:26,641
Stop it. Stop it!

1243
01:14:27,521 --> 01:14:30,681
You feel the need
to suffer. Go ahead.

1244
01:14:31,961 --> 01:14:33,521
But let's be fair
about the thing, man.

1245
01:14:33,561 --> 01:14:36,081
Let's work out
a reasonable
amount of misery

1246
01:14:36,121 --> 01:14:37,881
to pay off the guilt.

1247
01:14:38,441 --> 01:14:41,121
Now, I have an idea,
Jim, and it's a beaut.

1248
01:14:41,201 --> 01:14:42,961
Why don't you
chop off a foot?

1249
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,640
Well, you heard me.

1250
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:49,000
Get yourself an ax
and go out here somewhere
and have an accident

1251
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,840
and come back
without a foot.

1252
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,920
Doc, you're talking crazy.

1253
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,720
Why, is a foot too much?

1254
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,238
How about some toes?
Or some fingers?

1255
01:14:58,598 --> 01:15:01,118
How about just one
lousy little finger?

1256
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:06,038
You're nuts.

1257
01:15:06,078 --> 01:15:07,798
That wouldn't bring
Big Jim back.

1258
01:15:08,638 --> 01:15:11,597
Neither will what
you've been doing
to yourself.

1259
01:15:21,637 --> 01:15:23,157
Look at me, Doc.

1260
01:15:25,717 --> 01:15:28,237
Me crying just
like a little kid.

1261
01:15:30,517 --> 01:15:33,515
You're just crying
for Big Jim.
And you ought to.

1262
01:15:33,555 --> 01:15:36,474
You loved him
and he's dead.

1263
01:15:36,554 --> 01:15:39,234
Now you can let
yourself feel, Jim.

1264
01:15:51,514 --> 01:15:54,234
Have you got
a minute, Joe?
Yeah, sure.

1265
01:15:54,314 --> 01:15:57,714
Oh, Francie, will you
promote some coffee
for Little Jim?

1266
01:16:03,753 --> 01:16:05,913
The answer to that
New Guinea letter.

1267
01:16:25,710 --> 01:16:26,790
Can we schedule
a board hearing?

1268
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:27,870
Whenever you say.

1269
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:30,150
As soon as possible.

1270
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:31,150
Colonel Bliss,
will you please state

1271
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:34,350
your name, rank
and serial number?

1272
01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:44,348
Colonel, would you identify
yourself for us, please?

1273
01:16:52,187 --> 01:16:54,547
Mr. Future,
would you, please?

1274
01:16:54,627 --> 01:16:58,467
Delighted.
Alonzo Archimedes Future.

1275
01:16:58,507 --> 01:17:01,387
United States Army,
World Victory Two.

1276
01:17:01,427 --> 01:17:05,387
Expert in tactics,
tautology, logistics
and semantics.

1277
01:17:05,467 --> 01:17:07,787
Colonel, we'd like you
to understand

1278
01:17:07,867 --> 01:17:10,387
the nature of this
hearing and its purpose.

1279
01:17:10,467 --> 01:17:15,146
I am not interested.
It's Mr. Past you seek,
of course.

1280
01:17:15,186 --> 01:17:18,504
He spurns your invitation
and he damns your inquisition!

1281
01:17:20,984 --> 01:17:23,624
But enough of this
prattle of idiots.

1282
01:17:24,104 --> 01:17:26,824
I put an end to this
tristimanic farce.

1283
01:17:26,904 --> 01:17:28,704
Dismissed.

1284
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:46,463
Proceed, Larrabee.

1285
01:17:48,223 --> 01:17:52,423
"It is recommended that
subject officer be granted
a medical discharge,

1286
01:17:52,463 --> 01:17:56,301
"to be committed to
a veterans' hospital
for prolonged treatment

1287
01:17:56,381 --> 01:17:58,581
"under full custodial care."

1288
01:17:58,661 --> 01:18:02,461
I've asked that he be sent
to a hospital near where he
was born and went to school.

1289
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:07,500
Records, plus additional
information from New Guinea,
will be transmitted.

1290
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:09,220
What information?

1291
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:14,860
Pertinent data from
the Senior Air Surgeon.
It gives us a key.

1292
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:19,300
Based on this, a slow,
careful pattern of treatment
is indicated.

1293
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:22,260
The removal...
Captain! It's Colonel Bliss!

1294
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:29,057
I don't know! He pushed me.
He whacked Arkie and made
a break.

1295
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:31,097
This way.

1296
01:18:38,497 --> 01:18:39,697
Colonel!

1297
01:18:44,937 --> 01:18:46,817
No, Colonel! Don't!

1298
01:18:54,176 --> 01:18:56,696
Arkie, get down.

1299
01:19:09,454 --> 01:19:10,534
Mr. Future.

1300
01:19:12,174 --> 01:19:15,214
I want to talk to you.
Mr. Future?

1301
01:19:26,893 --> 01:19:29,813
Wait. Wait, Mr. Future.

1302
01:19:38,253 --> 01:19:40,651
Don't. Let's talk. Wait.

1303
01:19:40,731 --> 01:19:41,851
Please.

1304
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:02,450
Please.

1305
01:20:10,969 --> 01:20:11,929
Please.

1306
01:21:20,243 --> 01:21:22,322
I'd like to ask you
a question, Newman.

1307
01:21:22,402 --> 01:21:24,482
Would this have happened
if you hadn't bumped into him

1308
01:21:24,562 --> 01:21:26,800
in the Officers' Club
that night?

1309
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:30,440
Would he be
leaving like this?

1310
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:36,080
I'll be very interested
to see how you wrap up
your report on this.

1311
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,840
Colonel Bliss,
not Mr. Future,
but Colonel Bliss,

1312
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,560
did what
he most wanted to do.

1313
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:47,479
He...
He got rid of his guilt.

1314
01:21:49,999 --> 01:21:52,079
He joined his men.

1315
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:57,479
That list of names
that we sent to New Guinea,

1316
01:21:57,559 --> 01:22:00,559
they were all men
he'd ordered into combat.

1317
01:22:01,757 --> 01:22:02,957
All dead.

1318
01:22:07,597 --> 01:22:09,997
Now you tell me
if I could have
saved him.

1319
01:22:11,716 --> 01:22:14,476
Did I...
Did I play it too safe?

1320
01:22:14,516 --> 01:22:15,796
Did I gamble too much?

1321
01:22:15,876 --> 01:22:19,316
Could I have spotted
the moment he'd turn
back to the past?

1322
01:22:20,236 --> 01:22:23,116
Could I have pulled
one more thing
from his brain?

1323
01:22:26,196 --> 01:22:29,076
Was there a way?

1324
01:22:29,156 --> 01:22:30,956
I wish to hell I knew.

1325
01:22:56,393 --> 01:22:58,913
This is a pretty
thin turnout, Larrabee.

1326
01:22:58,953 --> 01:23:01,193
The Air Surgeon GeneraI'll be
coming in on that airplane.

1327
01:23:01,273 --> 01:23:02,232
Where are the rest
of your people?

1328
01:23:02,312 --> 01:23:03,712
Still making
the morning rounds, sir.

1329
01:23:03,792 --> 01:23:05,192
They'll get here
as soon as they can.

1330
01:23:05,232 --> 01:23:07,232
I don't want them
straggling in here
one by one.

1331
01:23:07,312 --> 01:23:09,552
This is supposed
to be an inspection.

1332
01:23:09,632 --> 01:23:12,232
Let's at least
give a hint that
we're in the Air Corps.

1333
01:23:12,272 --> 01:23:15,710
Sir, the
Under Secretary's plane is
in the traffic pattern.

1334
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:17,190
It's coming in
to land now.

1335
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:18,350
Good.

1336
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:20,150
(SHEEP BLEATING)

1337
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:26,150
What the devil is that?

1338
01:23:27,909 --> 01:23:32,069
Do not, repeat not,
attempt landing
at this time. Over.

1339
01:23:32,629 --> 01:23:35,429
I'll circle your field.
What's cooking? Over.

1340
01:23:36,269 --> 01:23:38,149
Sheep. Over.

1341
01:23:38,629 --> 01:23:40,349
Sheep? Over.

1342
01:23:40,389 --> 01:23:43,429
Roger.
Sheep on the runways.

1343
01:23:52,586 --> 01:23:53,746
Sheep?

1344
01:23:53,826 --> 01:23:54,786
Sheep?

1345
01:23:54,866 --> 01:23:56,106
Yes, sir. Sheep.

1346
01:24:00,026 --> 01:24:02,666
Sheep? My sheep?

1347
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:06,266
Well, who the devil
else has got sheep
around here, sir?

1348
01:24:21,225 --> 01:24:23,903
All week long we've been
cleaning up for inspection.

1349
01:24:23,983 --> 01:24:25,503
So how do you
clean sheep?

1350
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:26,943
I tell Gavoni to
take the sheep,

1351
01:24:26,983 --> 01:24:28,543
put them on the other side
of the field to graze.

1352
01:24:28,623 --> 01:24:31,063
With no fence?
Sheep drift!

1353
01:24:31,143 --> 01:24:32,863
Don't you know
anything about sheep?

1354
01:24:32,903 --> 01:24:35,863
In Jersey City,
I should learn
to be a shepherd?

1355
01:24:42,222 --> 01:24:44,342
Don't scare 'em!
They'll stampede.

1356
01:24:44,382 --> 01:24:45,942
They'll stampede!

(SOLDIERS LAUGHING)

1358
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:06,899
Don't worry, Doc.

1359
01:25:11,419 --> 01:25:12,579
Now would you
behave yourself?

1360
01:25:12,659 --> 01:25:15,019
This is no time
to be neurotic.

1361
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:19,619
One more passenger for you.

1362
01:25:23,739 --> 01:25:26,099
All you men
with the vehicles.

1363
01:25:26,139 --> 01:25:28,059
Surround them.

1364
01:25:28,299 --> 01:25:29,739
Surround them.

1365
01:25:35,576 --> 01:25:38,136
Now, this is an order.

1366
01:25:38,216 --> 01:25:41,216
You're the leader.
You lead and they'll follow.

1367
01:25:41,296 --> 01:25:42,256
Do you understand?

1368
01:25:42,296 --> 01:25:43,256
(BLEATS)

1369
01:25:43,336 --> 01:25:45,456
Very good.
Okay, Captain.

1370
01:25:46,536 --> 01:25:50,736
All right, boys.
Now move them out slowly.

1371
01:25:51,576 --> 01:25:52,496
Now lead.

1372
01:26:18,293 --> 01:26:20,253
Hiya, Barney.
Hello, Joe.

1373
01:26:20,892 --> 01:26:22,612
I thought you didn't
speak to the Pentagon.

1374
01:26:22,652 --> 01:26:24,652
Oh, well, I still
stutter a little.

1375
01:26:24,732 --> 01:26:25,932
Look, I've got to rush.
I just wanted you to know

1376
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:28,012
that General Snowden is
coming by to see you later.

1377
01:26:28,772 --> 01:26:31,612
About a patient of yours,
a Captain Paul Cabot Winston.

1378
01:26:33,012 --> 01:26:35,852
He's VIP, Joe.
Very VIP.

1379
01:26:35,892 --> 01:26:38,092
Now I've got to rush.
See you later.

1380
01:26:43,252 --> 01:26:45,489
The key is what
happened to him
in that cellar.

1381
01:26:45,529 --> 01:26:47,809
Yes, sir, but I can't
get through to it.

1382
01:26:48,409 --> 01:26:50,769
If I question him,
he falls asleep.

1383
01:26:51,529 --> 01:26:53,929
Sodium pentothal
negative so far.

1384
01:26:55,569 --> 01:26:57,889
Well, it looks
like it's going to be
a long haul for him.

1385
01:26:57,969 --> 01:27:01,969
Yes, sir.
He's on the transfer list
for extended hospitalization.

1386
01:27:02,049 --> 01:27:04,449
But at least
he'll be close to
his home and family.

1387
01:27:05,529 --> 01:27:06,969
It might help.

1388
01:27:09,489 --> 01:27:11,888
Newman, Winston's
staying on here.

1389
01:27:12,648 --> 01:27:15,808
May I have the General's
permission to ask why?

1390
01:27:15,888 --> 01:27:19,728
The father flew down from
Washington when they first
brought Winston back.

1391
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:21,326
He decided that
it would be best

1392
01:27:21,406 --> 01:27:25,366
if no other member
of the family see Paul
in his present condition.

1393
01:27:25,446 --> 01:27:27,006
Including his wife?

1394
01:27:27,086 --> 01:27:28,366
Including his wife.

1395
01:27:33,206 --> 01:27:35,765
Well, it's too bad
we don't have a place
in Outer Mongolia.

1396
01:27:35,845 --> 01:27:37,285
You're missing
the point, Newman.

1397
01:27:37,365 --> 01:27:41,605
The Winstons would
feel the same about the
Congressional Medal of Honor.

1398
01:27:41,645 --> 01:27:43,965
They'd want it to be
a private matter.

1399
01:27:44,045 --> 01:27:46,605
Sir, we're scheduled to
take off in 10 minutes.

1400
01:27:46,685 --> 01:27:48,645
Be right with you, Barney.

1401
01:27:49,885 --> 01:27:53,165
Newman, what are your
plans after the war?

1402
01:27:53,205 --> 01:27:54,165
Well...

1403
01:27:54,245 --> 01:27:58,883
As of January 1, Colfax
is going to be deactivated
as a training base.

1404
01:27:58,923 --> 01:28:01,322
It becomes a permanent
mental hospital.

1405
01:28:01,362 --> 01:28:03,362
I'd like you to stay on
and run it.

1406
01:28:03,442 --> 01:28:05,882
You're dedicated,
highly qualified.

1407
01:28:06,802 --> 01:28:08,562
Well, no offense, sir.
I...

1408
01:28:09,482 --> 01:28:11,802
Oh, I like to
think of myself as

1409
01:28:12,522 --> 01:28:13,802
a qualified civilian.

1410
01:28:16,962 --> 01:28:18,562
Well, you don't have to
make up your mind now.

1411
01:28:18,602 --> 01:28:20,722
You can send word
to me in Washington.

1412
01:28:20,802 --> 01:28:23,682
We'll leave it open
till I hear from you.

1413
01:28:24,122 --> 01:28:25,801
Please consider
the matter carefully.

1414
01:28:25,841 --> 01:28:27,121
Yes, sir.

01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:40,559
Hurry it up there!
On the double!

01:28:41,719 --> 01:28:43,199
Move it!

goodbye to you.

1420
01:29:00,438 --> 01:29:02,398
I sure appreciate
that, Lieutenant.

1421
01:29:02,478 --> 01:29:04,478
And I want to thank you
for all the nice things
you done.

1422
01:29:04,558 --> 01:29:05,838
I didn't do anything.

1423
01:29:05,918 --> 01:29:07,236
Well, yes, you did.

1424
01:29:07,316 --> 01:29:09,276
You come up
and talk with me
when I was alone

1425
01:29:09,316 --> 01:29:11,116
and I just wasn't
alone no more.

1426
01:29:11,996 --> 01:29:12,956
And, Captain?

1427
01:29:13,036 --> 01:29:14,555
No. You did it, Jim.

1428
01:29:14,635 --> 01:29:16,115
We just showed you
the way.

1429
01:29:16,995 --> 01:29:18,795
Well, I don't believe
I would have found it
myself.

1430
01:29:18,875 --> 01:29:20,195
In my humble opinion,

1431
01:29:20,235 --> 01:29:22,315
you were in the hands
of quacks in Ward 3.

1432
01:29:22,395 --> 01:29:24,395
You came to us
and we knew what to do.

1433
01:29:24,475 --> 01:29:26,195
Now, you got everything?
Uh-huh!

1434
01:29:26,275 --> 01:29:27,915
Toothbrush?
Yeah.

1435
01:29:29,315 --> 01:29:34,515
Candy bar, soap and nylon.

01:29:37,235 --> 01:29:38,555
Jake, you're a wonder!

1437
01:29:38,595 --> 01:29:40,514
Remind me to recommend you
for procurement officer.

1438
01:29:40,594 --> 01:29:42,074
I accept.

1439
01:29:42,152 --> 01:29:44,632
You better
get moving, Jim.

1440
01:29:45,592 --> 01:29:47,872
Yeah. Jake, so long.
Goodbye.

1441
01:29:47,952 --> 01:29:49,872

Goodbye, Jim.

01:29:58,952 --> 01:30:01,552
Thank you, Captain.
Thank you.

01:30:36,668 --> 01:30:38,948
Oh, Jackson,
you take the jeep back.

1444
01:30:39,028 --> 01:30:40,948
Think I could use a walk.

1445
01:30:50,228 --> 01:30:52,268
Poor Jake.
You've got him worried.

1446
01:30:53,186 --> 01:30:55,545
The word is you've been
asked to stay on.

1447
01:30:56,185 --> 01:30:58,425
That'll just ruin

His post-war plan.

A huge psychiatric
cartel to be known
as Newman & Leibowitz.

1451
01:31:06,545 --> 01:31:08,265
He'll be glad to
fill you in on details.

1452
01:31:08,345 --> 01:31:09,705
Now, don't tell me.

1453
01:31:09,785 --> 01:31:11,105
He'll be
the business-getter.

1454
01:31:11,185 --> 01:31:12,665
A neurosis tout.

1455
01:31:12,745 --> 01:31:15,265
He's already got you
located in San Francisco,

1456
01:31:15,345 --> 01:31:17,385
with a branch office
in Beverly Hills.

1457
01:31:17,465 --> 01:31:18,984
Well, that's nice.

1458
01:31:20,624 --> 01:31:23,784
Well, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

1459
01:31:24,984 --> 01:31:26,424
What about you, Francie?

1460
01:31:26,504 --> 01:31:28,742
They'll want you
to sign up again.

1461
01:31:28,822 --> 01:31:31,222
I'll have to be
fair about it.
I'll flip a coin.

1462
01:31:31,302 --> 01:31:33,782
If it stays in the air,
I'll sign on again.

1463
01:31:35,222 --> 01:31:36,662
I'm serious.

1464
01:31:37,142 --> 01:31:38,422
So am I.

1465
01:31:39,342 --> 01:31:42,862
When this is over,
I want to get out
and have some babies.

1466
01:31:44,981 --> 01:31:48,181
I suppose you might be
pretty good at that, too.

1467
01:31:48,221 --> 01:31:51,541
If not, it's the kind
of thing I could learn.

1468
01:31:51,581 --> 01:31:53,181
Do you think it's
wrong of me, Joe?

1469
01:31:53,261 --> 01:31:56,461
To want to close
out my 201 file
when this is over?

1470
01:31:58,581 --> 01:31:59,941
KOPP: Hey, Captain.

1471
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:02,581
What is it, Arkie?

1472
01:32:02,661 --> 01:32:04,099
Blodgett asked me
to find you.

1473
01:32:04,179 --> 01:32:05,179
You're wanted
in your office.

1474
01:32:05,259 --> 01:32:06,539
She's probably
looking for me, too.

1475
01:32:06,579 --> 01:32:09,018
It's 10 minutes
into my shift.

1476
01:32:17,058 --> 01:32:19,058
Mrs. Winston is here.

1477
01:32:21,578 --> 01:32:23,538
Oh, Francie,

1478
01:32:24,578 --> 01:32:27,498
perhaps you'd better bring
Captain Winston into Room A.

1479
01:32:31,178 --> 01:32:32,938
Good evening.
I'm Helene Winston.

1480
01:32:32,978 --> 01:32:34,697
I'm Captain Newman.

1481
01:32:34,737 --> 01:32:38,017
But we weren't
expecting you till
tomorrow morning.

1482
01:32:38,097 --> 01:32:40,295
You called.
You said to come.

1483
01:32:40,335 --> 01:32:42,495
There's no virtue
in delay, is there?

1484
01:32:43,215 --> 01:32:44,895
Well, no.
I suppose not.

1485
01:32:45,015 --> 01:32:46,735
You found
a nice place to stay?

1486
01:32:46,815 --> 01:32:48,975
A tourist court.
Clean, from what
I could see.

1487
01:32:49,015 --> 01:32:51,695
May I see my husband now,
Captain Newman?

1488
01:32:52,895 --> 01:32:56,735
Mrs. Winston, before
you see your husband,
I feel that I should

1489
01:32:58,215 --> 01:33:00,614
mention that you'll
find him strange,

1490
01:33:02,174 --> 01:33:03,814
listless, remote.

1491
01:33:05,694 --> 01:33:08,294
He may not even answer
simple questions.

1492
01:33:09,134 --> 01:33:11,454
I'm afraid you just
don't understand him,
Captain Newman.

1493
01:33:11,534 --> 01:33:13,414
Paul was always given
to reticence.

1494
01:33:13,494 --> 01:33:14,932
This is only temporary,
I'm sure.

1495
01:33:15,012 --> 01:33:17,572
He's basically
sound and well.
Don't you agree?

1496
01:33:17,652 --> 01:33:19,732
In his mind, I mean.
His faculties.

1497
01:33:23,571 --> 01:33:25,091
Mrs. Winston,

1498
01:33:25,611 --> 01:33:27,251
this is a psychiatric ward.

1499
01:33:27,331 --> 01:33:29,331
Oh, I know, Captain.
I'm aware of that.

1500
01:33:29,411 --> 01:33:33,051
I'm sure many men's
emotional reverses
require this kind of

1501
01:33:33,611 --> 01:33:35,851
medical attention,
but my husband,

1502
01:33:37,851 --> 01:33:38,811
no.

1503
01:33:40,331 --> 01:33:42,851
We are not people
who pamper themselves,
Captain Newman.

1504
01:33:42,891 --> 01:33:46,211
We're proud that
we can draw
on our inner will.

1505
01:33:46,291 --> 01:33:47,491
Mrs. Winston...

1506
01:33:47,531 --> 01:33:49,930
I should like to see
my husband now.

1507
01:33:59,608 --> 01:34:01,488
Oh, Mrs. Winston,
Lieutenant Corum.

1508
01:34:01,568 --> 01:34:03,168
Good evening.

1509
01:34:03,368 --> 01:34:05,408
The ward itself is
beyond that door

1510
01:34:05,448 --> 01:34:08,968
but we thought
you'd prefer to see
your husband in here.

1511
01:34:34,765 --> 01:34:36,405
It's Helene, dear.

1512
01:34:44,404 --> 01:34:47,004
Aren't you going to
ask me to sit down?

1513
01:34:55,164 --> 01:34:57,684
You sent for her?

1514
01:34:57,764 --> 01:34:59,124
But didn't
General Snowden...

1515
01:34:59,204 --> 01:35:01,482
I sent for her
because he wasn't responding
to anything else.

1516
01:35:01,562 --> 01:35:05,561
I had reason to believe
he'd respond to her.
But how could he?

1517
01:35:05,641 --> 01:35:08,041
She strolls in
and asks for a seat.

1518
01:35:08,961 --> 01:35:11,641
She hasn't seen
that man in two years.

1519
01:35:12,881 --> 01:35:14,441
It's her husband.

1520
01:35:14,921 --> 01:35:17,481
It's her lover,
if we may speculate.

1521
01:35:17,561 --> 01:35:19,001
Well, it's strange for her.

1522
01:35:19,081 --> 01:35:21,281
What did you
expect her to do?

1523
01:35:21,321 --> 01:35:22,881
To behave like a wife.

1524
01:35:22,961 --> 01:35:26,161
Instead, she acts
like a referee
at a chess match.

1525
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:36,998
He says he's tired.
Very tired.

1526
01:35:37,078 --> 01:35:38,998
I really shouldn't have
come this late.

1527
01:35:39,038 --> 01:35:41,198
I'll take him
back to his room.

1528
01:35:41,278 --> 01:35:43,158
He'll feel better in
the morning. Good night.

1529
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:45,518
Can I give you a lift?

1530
01:35:45,598 --> 01:35:47,638
Thank you.
I've rented a car.

1531
01:35:56,477 --> 01:35:59,837
Hup! Hup!
Hup, two, three, four!

1532
01:35:59,917 --> 01:36:04,277
Hup! Hup!
Hup, two, three, four!

1533

1536

1539
01:36:39,514 --> 01:36:41,074
Package of goodies
for you, Newman.

1540
01:36:41,114 --> 01:36:42,633
Compliments of the C.O.

1541
01:36:49,631 --> 01:36:51,631
Sign here, please.
Sign for what?

1542
01:36:51,711 --> 01:36:53,591
Fourteen Italian
prisoners of war.

1543
01:36:53,671 --> 01:36:55,991
And what the devil
are 14 Italian POWs

1544
01:36:56,031 --> 01:36:58,431
doing in the middle
of the Arizona desert?

1545
01:36:58,511 --> 01:37:00,671
Well, you see, according
to the Geneva Convention,

1546
01:37:00,751 --> 01:37:02,271
prisoners should be
sent to a climate

1547
01:37:02,351 --> 01:37:04,311
similar to the one
in which they were
captured.

1548
01:37:04,391 --> 01:37:07,990
We picked up 300
of those jokers
in the Libyan Desert,

1549
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:11,190
and those 14 out there
need hospitalization.

1550
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:12,750
Are they mental cases?

1551
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:13,830
No.

1552
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:18,270
Leibowitz, get me
Colonel Pyser on the phone!

1553
01:37:18,350 --> 01:37:21,870
Ask and you shall receive.
He's on the phone,
calling you.

1554
01:37:24,228 --> 01:37:26,748
Captain Newman speaking.
Now what...

1555
01:37:26,988 --> 01:37:29,708
Yes, they're here.
Just one question.

1556
01:37:29,748 --> 01:37:31,907
Isn't it a violation
of the Geneva Convention

1557
01:37:31,987 --> 01:37:34,667
to put prisoners of war
in a psychiatric ward?

1558
01:37:34,707 --> 01:37:36,107
I'm sure it is.

1559
01:37:36,147 --> 01:37:38,507
But you have the only ward
where they can be kept
under lock and key.

1560
01:37:38,547 --> 01:37:40,627
Does that make
any sense to you?

1561
01:37:41,627 --> 01:37:43,587
Some, sir.

1562
01:37:43,667 --> 01:37:44,627
Good.

1563
01:37:44,707 --> 01:37:47,627
Oh, and by the way, Newman,
the United States is at war
with Italy,

1564
01:37:47,667 --> 01:37:50,187
so they're enemy,
not houseguests.

1565
01:37:50,227 --> 01:37:53,227
And don't go probing
around looking for
any symptoms.

1566
01:37:53,267 --> 01:37:55,707
If they hate their fathers,
that's all right with us.

1567
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:57,546
They're enemy. Period.

1568
01:38:09,264 --> 01:38:10,264
Leibowitz.

1569
01:38:10,344 --> 01:38:11,544
LEIBOWITZ: Yeah, Doc.

1570
01:38:11,624 --> 01:38:13,304
Take this bunch
into the ward.

1571
01:38:13,384 --> 01:38:15,544
Have Blodgett check them in
after they've been showered.

1572
01:38:15,624 --> 01:38:16,584
Sure, Doc.

I came from,

you had to know at least
six different languages

1581
01:39:11,018 --> 01:39:13,617
NEWMAN: Mrs. Winston,
I'd counted on you for a...

1582
01:39:13,697 --> 01:39:16,297
A breakthrough,
some emotional reaction.

1583
01:39:17,417 --> 01:39:18,857
And as long as
you've been here,
nothing has happened.

1584
01:39:18,937 --> 01:39:21,817
Nothing from him
and nothing from you.

1585
01:39:21,897 --> 01:39:24,097
I'm a patient woman, Captain.

1586
01:39:24,377 --> 01:39:26,017
Maybe too patient.

1587
01:39:26,697 --> 01:39:27,777
I beg your pardon?

1588
01:39:27,817 --> 01:39:29,057
Mrs. Winston,

1589
01:39:30,377 --> 01:39:32,297
I hope that you're
going to understand,

1590
01:39:32,377 --> 01:39:34,497
and I don't want
to embarrass you,

1591
01:39:34,577 --> 01:39:38,296
but if your answers
will help me to understand,
if they'll help Paul,

1592
01:39:38,376 --> 01:39:41,376
then, of course,
that's the most
important thing.

1593
01:39:41,456 --> 01:39:42,816
Of course.

1594
01:39:45,414 --> 01:39:47,734
What is it that
you want to know?

1595
01:39:50,294 --> 01:39:55,574
The room where you
two meet has a chair,
and it has a cot, a bed,

1596
01:39:57,174 --> 01:39:59,014
and it also has a lock.

1597
01:40:01,093 --> 01:40:03,933
Mrs. Winston,
have you ever
locked that door?

1598
01:40:05,253 --> 01:40:07,053
I was not aware,
Captain, that you
were one of those

1599
01:40:07,133 --> 01:40:08,933
who reads sex
into everything.

1600
01:40:08,973 --> 01:40:10,133
Well, you're his wife.
He's a man.

1601
01:40:10,213 --> 01:40:11,293
Not just now, is he?

1602
01:40:11,333 --> 01:40:12,413
Well, that's
the whole point!

1603
01:40:12,493 --> 01:40:13,693
What have you done
to change that?

1604
01:40:13,733 --> 01:40:16,493
This is most embarrassing!
There is no point in
continuing this conversation!

1605
01:40:16,573 --> 01:40:19,253
Oh, I think that there is,
if you love him,
if you really love him,

1606
01:40:19,333 --> 01:40:20,691
if you really want
to help him.

1607
01:40:20,771 --> 01:40:23,691
There is nothing
in the world
that I want more!

1608
01:40:23,771 --> 01:40:27,290
Then act like a woman to him
and not a choir companion.

1609
01:40:27,370 --> 01:40:30,050
Buy some perfume.
Get a nice new dress.

1610
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:32,570
Something feminine,
something flattering.

1611
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:34,690
You mean erotic,
don't you?

1612
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:36,490
Why not?

1613
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:40,570
I am hardly the kind of woman
who can be expected to act
like a prostitute!

1614
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:42,370
Good night, Captain!

1615
01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:51,209
A verbal and then
a teletype from
Area Command.

1616
01:40:51,289 --> 01:40:53,369
You're not to contact her,

1617
01:40:53,449 --> 01:40:54,969
and you're to stay
away from Winston.

1618
01:40:55,009 --> 01:40:57,247
Joe, you can't treat
a woman like that.

1619
01:40:57,287 --> 01:40:59,167
It makes
the hospital look bad.

1620
01:40:59,207 --> 01:41:01,887
It makes the service
look bad.

1621
01:41:01,967 --> 01:41:04,567
Aren't you all
missing the point?

1622
01:41:04,647 --> 01:41:07,007
No one is worrying
about the patient.

1623
01:41:09,047 --> 01:41:14,007
He's not a poor,
sick, groping boy.

1624
01:41:14,087 --> 01:41:18,086
He's Paragraph Two
in some damned fool
teletype report.

1625
01:41:19,446 --> 01:41:22,206
It's only until
we get this thing
straightened out.

1626
01:41:23,606 --> 01:41:25,966
What do we do
in the meantime?

1627
01:41:28,286 --> 01:41:30,046
Feed him some aspirin?

1628
01:41:32,124 --> 01:41:33,404
LEIBOWITZ:
That's what I said.

1629
01:41:35,124 --> 01:41:37,044
I'll be the one in charge.

1630
01:41:39,684 --> 01:41:41,683
Both fine, Doctor.
Good.

1631
01:41:54,683 --> 01:41:57,683

be a very nice tree.

He is busy
with the tree.

1636
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:15,800
He is also wanted
by Captain Newman.

1637
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:17,240
He is coming.

1638
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:23,480
Leibowitz, I gave you
three bucks,

1639
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:26,640
and you also got a dollar
from every other orderly
and from every patient

1640
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:29,640
so that Ward 7
could have a tree
to match the big one

1641
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:32,039
that Colonel Pyser
put in the rec hall.

1642
01:42:32,119 --> 01:42:33,559
Correct.

1643
01:42:33,839 --> 01:42:36,879
Is that the best tree
you could buy
with all that money?

1644
01:42:36,959 --> 01:42:38,679
Who said I bought it?

1645
01:42:38,759 --> 01:42:40,679
Well, where did you get it?

1646
01:42:46,157 --> 01:42:47,117
From another tree.

1647
01:42:47,157 --> 01:42:48,437
From another...

1648
01:42:48,877 --> 01:42:51,797
What... What tree?
When? Where?

1649
01:42:52,997 --> 01:42:54,437
Leibowitz,

1650
01:42:54,877 --> 01:42:56,756
is there some connection
between this tree

1651
01:42:56,836 --> 01:42:59,916
and Colonel Pyser's
tree in the rec hall?

1652
01:42:59,956 --> 01:43:00,996
You better sit down.

1653
01:43:01,076 --> 01:43:02,156
I stay mad better
standing up!

1654
01:43:02,196 --> 01:43:04,236
You look like
Captain Bligh.
Quit the stalling!

1655
01:43:04,316 --> 01:43:06,956
Now, just tell me
the whole story.

1656
01:43:08,836 --> 01:43:11,276
The tree in the rec hall
was a good 20 feet high.

1657
01:43:11,316 --> 01:43:14,396
A guy lying on his back
couldn't even see the top.

1658
01:43:14,476 --> 01:43:16,876
It's really not a very
interesting story, I mean...

1659
01:43:16,916 --> 01:43:19,234
Oh, I find it
a fascinating story.

1660
01:43:19,314 --> 01:43:21,073
How did you do it?

1661
01:43:21,873 --> 01:43:23,553
I got a ladder and a saw.

1662
01:43:23,633 --> 01:43:25,313
I climbed up
the ladder and...

1663
01:43:25,393 --> 01:43:27,713
Saw? What kind...
What kind of a saw?

1664
01:43:27,793 --> 01:43:30,113
How many types
of saws are there?
I mean, a saw for sawing...

1665
01:43:30,193 --> 01:43:31,833
Where...
Where did you get it?

1666
01:43:31,913 --> 01:43:33,393
The ladder or the saw?
The saw.

1667
01:43:33,473 --> 01:43:34,673
The saw.

1668
01:43:35,313 --> 01:43:37,353
I got it out of surgery.

1669
01:43:40,473 --> 01:43:41,953
You stole
a surgical saw?

1670
01:43:42,033 --> 01:43:43,433
Well, I...
Only borrowed.

1671
01:43:43,473 --> 01:43:44,912
It's already been returned.

1672
01:43:44,992 --> 01:43:45,992
It's a little bent.

1673
01:43:46,072 --> 01:43:47,512
Oh, that's nice.

1674
01:43:48,272 --> 01:43:51,912
Nothing better for
a surgeon, of course,
than a bent saw.

1675
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:55,830
For crooked patients.

1676
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:57,750
He can saw his way
around corners!

1677
01:43:57,830 --> 01:43:59,830
Are you so blasted stupid
that you think that

1678
01:43:59,910 --> 01:44:03,150
Colonel Pyser won't see
that his tree had
its top chopped off?

1679
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:04,790
But, Captain,
if I've done anything,

1680
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:07,870
I've improved the appearance
of the colonel's tree!

1681
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:09,550
How did you get it
out of the rec hall?

1682
01:44:09,630 --> 01:44:11,229
Oh, it was terrific!

1683
01:44:11,309 --> 01:44:12,949
I took it out
the back window,

1684
01:44:13,029 --> 01:44:15,109
through the sheep pen,
up the back stairs.

1685
01:44:15,189 --> 01:44:16,509
No one got a peep
at what I was doing.

1686
01:44:16,589 --> 01:44:19,109
No? Not one of
the 5,000 blind men
on this installation

1687
01:44:19,189 --> 01:44:21,349
saw you carrying
around a five-foot tree?

1688
01:44:21,389 --> 01:44:22,869
We didn't carry it.

1689
01:44:25,869 --> 01:44:27,549
What did you do?

1690
01:44:27,629 --> 01:44:29,147
I put it in an ambulance.

1691
01:44:29,227 --> 01:44:30,267
An ambulance?

1692
01:44:30,347 --> 01:44:31,427
Mmm-hmm.

1693
01:44:32,827 --> 01:44:34,546
Who was the driver?

1694
01:44:35,506 --> 01:44:37,066
Cooshy.
Cooshy?

1695
01:44:39,386 --> 01:44:40,586
Cooshy Flinn?

1696
01:44:40,666 --> 01:44:42,026
He's a wonderful driver.

1697
01:44:42,066 --> 01:44:44,666
Cooshy Flinn is
a patient!

1698
01:44:44,746 --> 01:44:45,906
But that's the reason
I chose him.

1699
01:44:45,986 --> 01:44:48,746
I could always claim
he was off his head when
he stole the ambulance.

1700
01:44:48,786 --> 01:44:50,146
Then Gavoni told me
that we would...

1701
01:44:50,186 --> 01:44:51,586
Gavoni?
Yes, Gavoni.

1702
01:44:51,626 --> 01:44:52,666
He was in charge
of the stretcher.

1703
01:44:52,746 --> 01:44:54,106
The what?
The stretcher.

1704
01:44:54,186 --> 01:44:55,386
We put the tree
on the stretcher.

1705
01:44:55,466 --> 01:44:56,906
You would never
think it was a tree.

1706
01:44:56,986 --> 01:45:00,265
Why not?
Did you dress it
in a uniform?

1707
01:45:00,345 --> 01:45:01,545
Oh, no, no.
We covered it
with a blanket.

1708
01:45:01,625 --> 01:45:05,663
You would be the first one
to swear it looked exactly
like a corpse.

1709
01:45:07,383 --> 01:45:08,463
You may go.

1710
01:45:08,543 --> 01:45:09,583
Thank you.

1711
01:45:09,663 --> 01:45:10,943
No, wait.

1712
01:45:11,383 --> 01:45:14,183
Excuse me for asking
so hostile a question,

1713
01:45:14,263 --> 01:45:16,863
but since you didn't
spend one red cent
on that noble tree

1714
01:45:16,943 --> 01:45:21,423
which you wrapped
in a blanket and conveyed
in an ambulance,

1715
01:45:21,503 --> 01:45:23,903
what did you do
with all the money?

1716
01:45:24,982 --> 01:45:28,902
The money I saved
by not buying
a crummy tree

1717
01:45:28,982 --> 01:45:32,742
went for presents
for my patients.

1718
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:47,580
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1719
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:50,499
Here you are, Doc.

1720
01:45:51,099 --> 01:45:52,459
Thanks, Arkie.

1721
01:45:52,539 --> 01:45:53,859
(THUDDING)

1722
01:45:55,979 --> 01:45:57,579
It's Winston.
Who's with him?

1723
01:45:57,659 --> 01:46:00,659
Stop him! Stop him!

1724
01:46:00,739 --> 01:46:03,499
For God's sake,
stop him, please!

1725
01:46:04,619 --> 01:46:07,499
I revolted him!

1726
01:46:07,579 --> 01:46:10,939
I revolted him!

1727
01:46:53,373 --> 01:46:55,133
Have a smoke, Paul.

1728
01:46:57,533 --> 01:46:58,973
Go on, take it.

1729
01:47:06,812 --> 01:47:10,812
Now, you've raised
quite a rumpus in here.

1730
01:47:10,892 --> 01:47:14,772
Now, suppose you tell me
what it is that you were
trying to prove.

1731
01:47:15,612 --> 01:47:16,692
What?

1732
01:47:21,252 --> 01:47:25,172
Want her to go away.

1733
01:47:25,210 --> 01:47:27,450
Why, Paul? Why?

1734
01:47:29,689 --> 01:47:31,249
Go back to room now.
Hide.

1735
01:47:31,289 --> 01:47:32,569
No.

1736
01:47:32,809 --> 01:47:35,529
You've turned
that room of yours
into another cellar.

1737
01:47:35,609 --> 01:47:37,489
You're out of
the cellar now.

1738
01:47:37,569 --> 01:47:40,409
What cellar?
No! No!

1739
01:47:40,449 --> 01:47:42,929
What happened in
the cellar, Paul?

1740
01:47:43,009 --> 01:47:44,569
Don't remember.
You do.

1741
01:47:44,649 --> 01:47:45,689
You will.

1742
01:47:46,129 --> 01:47:47,569
Thirsty!
Later.

1743
01:47:47,649 --> 01:47:49,569
What happened
in the cellar?
Nothing!

1744
01:47:49,649 --> 01:47:51,969
You were in there
for 13 months

1745
01:47:52,049 --> 01:47:54,008
and nothing happened?

1746
01:47:54,768 --> 01:47:57,168
You were never
in any danger.

1747
01:47:57,248 --> 01:47:59,088
You were always safe
in there.

1748
01:47:59,128 --> 01:48:00,608
Go to hell!

1749
01:48:03,126 --> 01:48:05,246
Is that what's
tearing you apart?

1750
01:48:06,846 --> 01:48:08,966
That you were safe
in there?

1751
01:48:10,326 --> 01:48:12,046
That is it, isn't it?

1752
01:48:12,566 --> 01:48:14,006
No more war.

1753
01:48:14,086 --> 01:48:16,166
No more flights,
no flak, no danger.

1754
01:48:16,246 --> 01:48:19,605
Yes, yes, yes!
It was deep, dark, safe!

1755
01:48:29,365 --> 01:48:31,525
Could you have
escaped, Paul?

1756
01:48:33,805 --> 01:48:36,523
The town was
occupied by Germans.

1757
01:48:39,123 --> 01:48:42,403
Could you have escaped?
Could anybody have escaped?

1758
01:48:44,002 --> 01:48:45,922
I never tried.

1759
01:48:47,082 --> 01:48:49,842
I should have.
I never tried.

1760
01:48:51,922 --> 01:48:55,442
But don't tell God.
Don't tell, please.

1761
01:48:59,322 --> 01:49:01,282
Damn them for finding me.

1762
01:49:07,802 --> 01:49:09,841
I don't want to hurt her.

1763
01:49:12,999 --> 01:49:15,119
She mustn't know.

1764
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:18,719
Don't you understand?
She mustn't know that

1765
01:49:21,839 --> 01:49:24,159
I was a coward.

1766
01:49:36,213 --> 01:49:39,333
I told you
it wouldn't work but
you wouldn't believe me.

1767
01:49:39,413 --> 01:49:41,173
I knew it was wrong.

1768
01:49:41,973 --> 01:49:43,173
Wrong!

1769
01:49:43,253 --> 01:49:44,293
Mrs. Winston,

1770
01:49:45,973 --> 01:49:48,571
I want you to go in
there and see Paul.

1771
01:49:49,051 --> 01:49:50,211
Now.

1772
01:49:50,971 --> 01:49:53,211
Another experiment?
Hasn't he been
through enough?

1773
01:49:53,251 --> 01:49:54,811
Hasn't he suffered
enough?

1774
01:49:54,891 --> 01:49:56,251
No, not by his standards.

1775
01:49:56,331 --> 01:49:58,530
You see, he's a Winston.

1776
01:49:58,610 --> 01:49:59,690
And?

1777
01:50:00,370 --> 01:50:03,090
Fear is a normal thing
in ordinary men.

1778
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:05,210
It's something else
in a Winston.

1779
01:50:05,730 --> 01:50:07,210
It's cowardice.

1780
01:50:08,410 --> 01:50:10,450
Paul couldn't be
a coward.

1781
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:13,370
He's never done
a shameful thing
in his life.

1782
01:50:13,450 --> 01:50:14,410
No.

1783
01:50:14,930 --> 01:50:18,170
But he thinks that he has.
That's the whole point.

1784
01:50:18,250 --> 01:50:20,690
That's why you have
to go in there.

1785
01:50:22,050 --> 01:50:24,527
You saw the anguish
on his face.

1786
01:50:27,047 --> 01:50:28,407
The hatred.

1787
01:50:31,167 --> 01:50:32,647
That was shame.

1788
01:50:34,407 --> 01:50:35,807
Mrs. Winston,

1789
01:50:36,647 --> 01:50:39,527
that man became
a vegetable

1790
01:50:39,607 --> 01:50:41,527
rather than have you know.

1791
01:50:44,727 --> 01:50:46,567
He loves you so much,

1792
01:50:47,766 --> 01:50:51,006
he was willing to stay
that way the rest of his life.

1793
01:51:17,963 --> 01:51:20,363
How is it possible?

1794
01:51:20,403 --> 01:51:23,083
They didn't know
each other at all.

1795
01:51:23,123 --> 01:51:25,523
Yeah, maybe we could all use
a new language.

01:58:23,722 --> 01:58:27,202
And you've been through
this time and again,
haven't you?

1863
01:58:29,362 --> 01:58:31,722
Knowing it's all
so meaningless?

1864
01:58:37,562 --> 01:58:40,279
Little Jim
didn't think so.

1865
01:58:43,999 --> 01:58:45,599
In the letter, he...

1866
01:58:45,679 --> 01:58:47,279
He thanked us
for saving him.

1867
01:58:50,199 --> 01:58:52,799
"Back on the ball again,"
he said.

1868
01:58:54,319 --> 01:58:57,319
"I'm not a nobody
going nowhere."

1869
01:59:01,079 --> 01:59:05,198
No, he... He found
some meaning, Francie.

1870
01:59:06,998 --> 01:59:08,958
Man's need

1871
01:59:09,038 --> 01:59:13,118
to matter, and have it
make some difference
that he lived at all.

1872

(AIRPLANE WHIRRING)

1873
01:59:45,155 --> 01:59:47,235
Leibowitz, you're not
gonna get away with it
this time!

1874
01:59:52,513 --> 01:59:54,393
All right!
Where is it?

1875
01:59:54,433 --> 01:59:56,512
Gavoni!
Where is it?

1876
01:59:56,592 --> 01:59:58,672
Doc, take care of him.
He needs help!

1877
01:59:58,752 --> 02:00:00,072
Gavoni! Gavoni!

1878
02:00:00,152 --> 02:00:01,632
Not only my
sister's package,

1879
02:00:01,712 --> 02:00:04,192
but all the presents
my family sent me.

1880
02:00:04,272 --> 02:00:05,872
I... I gotta kill him!
I gotta kill him!

1881
02:00:05,952 --> 02:00:07,232
Gavoni, it's Christmas!

1882
02:00:07,272 --> 02:00:08,672
Well, then,
right after Christmas.

1883
02:00:09,397 --> 02:00:11,637
Hello, everybody!
Santa Claus is here!
