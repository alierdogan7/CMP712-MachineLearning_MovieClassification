00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:52,906
In the beginning, God created
the heavens and the earth.

7
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,942
The earth was a formless void,

8
00:00:56,077 --> 00:01:00,080
and darkness covered
the face of the deep.

9
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:04,185
And God said,
"let there be light",

10
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,152
and there was light.

11
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:15,562

God created the land...

00:03:17,576 --> 00:03:21,613
Our creator decided
to cleanse the earth.

And then they left us.

the land. It was their choice.

Or hers?

376
00:32:20,114 --> 00:32:21,548
- Sarah, I...
- Abraham.

377
00:32:21,682 --> 00:32:23,483
Abraham!

378
00:32:23,617 --> 00:32:25,452
You decide.

379
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:29,855
Mama.

380
00:32:31,124 --> 00:32:33,059
Or let God decide.

382
00:33:14,232 --> 00:33:15,699
Be brave.

383
00:33:24,308 --> 00:33:28,044
Assured by God
that they will survive,

384
00:33:28,178 --> 00:33:32,615
Abraham sends hagar and ishmael
into the wilderness.

385
00:33:44,427 --> 00:33:46,428
[Abraham] Goodbye, ishmael.

386
00:33:47,763 --> 00:33:50,264
Oh, my boy.

387

My boy.

388
00:33:52,534 --> 00:33:57,004
When you grow up, God will
bless you with many children.

[Sobs]

390
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:32,904
Mwah! Let me make you
some breakfast, Isaac.

391
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:37,042
After years of struggle,
Abraham has learned

392
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:42,880
that to be chosen by God
is a blessing and a test.

393
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,915
He must prove his faith

394
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,418
again and again.

Have I not shown you
enough faith?

402

[Sarah] Eat up.

403

When you have
children of your own,

404
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:49,721
you'll want them
to grow up as big and...

405
00:35:49,855 --> 00:35:51,356
Abraham?

406
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,827
What's the matter?

407
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,367
God wants a sacrifice.

408
00:36:05,303 --> 00:36:07,538
My boy.

409
00:36:07,672 --> 00:36:09,340

411
00:37:29,516 --> 00:37:32,551
Father, we have the firewood.

412
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:34,953
But where's the lamb?

413
00:37:40,493 --> 00:37:44,863
The Lord will provide
a sacrifice, my son.

414
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,706
[Bleating]

415
00:37:55,841 --> 00:37:57,008
Did Abraham take a lamb?

416
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:58,408
No, mistress.

417
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,210
Oh!

418
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,596
Bring the wood.

419
00:38:46,388 --> 00:38:49,022
Father? What are you doing?

420
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,663
You're hurting me, father.

421
00:38:55,797 --> 00:38:57,331
Isaac.

422
00:38:57,465 --> 00:38:59,500
You must trust in God.

Please.

428
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:37,335
Please, father.

429
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:40,438
Forgive me.

Oh, my boy, my boy.

[Sarah sobbing]

452
00:41:23,736 --> 00:41:26,938
Abraham has passed
the ultimate test.

453
00:41:27,072 --> 00:41:30,241
He will become the father
of God's nation.

454
00:41:31,977 --> 00:41:33,344
Abraham.

455
00:41:33,478 --> 00:41:36,113
Now it's up to Isaac.

456
00:41:36,248 --> 00:41:38,782
He will have a son called Jacob.

457
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:41,751
God will rename him Israel.

458
00:41:43,321 --> 00:41:47,090
The promise of descendants
as numerous as the stars

459
00:41:47,225 --> 00:41:48,992
is coming true.

460
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,062
But soon famine
forces the Israelites

461
00:41:56,197 --> 00:41:59,866
far from the promised land
to Egypt.

462
00:42:04,638 --> 00:42:07,339
Here they are enslaved
by Pharaoh.

463
00:42:08,775 --> 00:42:10,977
Over the next 400 years,

464
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:14,579
Abraham and God
become a distant memory.

465
00:42:15,982 --> 00:42:19,885
All his people reduced
to beasts of burden.

00:42:22,688 --> 00:42:24,589
Except one.

You're not going to fight again.

I can't refuse.
He's Pharaoh's son, mother.

470
00:42:47,545 --> 00:42:49,246
The fighting between them
has to stop.

471
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,813
Moses doesn't want to fight.

472
00:42:50,948 --> 00:42:53,750
It's your son who forces him
into it, and keeps losing.

But you were the one
that started it!

485
00:43:40,295 --> 00:43:41,728
I will be Pharaoh!

486
00:43:41,862 --> 00:43:45,999
Then you'd better start
behaving like one.

487
00:43:46,134 --> 00:43:48,368
This is your fault. You should
never have let her keep him.

488
00:43:48,503 --> 00:43:50,436
[Pharaoh] Silence.

- Silence, I said!

What's he talking about?

491
00:44:00,814 --> 00:44:03,182
You'd better tell him now.

00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:32,540
Hey, you!

564
00:51:32,674 --> 00:51:34,808
Back to work!

565
00:51:38,112 --> 00:51:41,148
Wait. Wait. Please.

566
00:51:41,282 --> 00:51:43,315
I'll take care of him, master.

567
00:51:46,526 --> 00:51:49,395
What are you doing? Trying
to get us all a beating?

568
00:51:52,165 --> 00:51:55,000
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

569
00:51:55,135 --> 00:51:57,469
My name is Moses.

570
00:52:00,739 --> 00:52:02,707
Moses?

571
00:52:02,841 --> 00:52:04,742
You are Moses?

572
00:52:06,178 --> 00:52:07,812
I need to see your elders.

573
00:52:11,484 --> 00:52:13,950
Come with me.

574
00:52:28,037 --> 00:52:30,772
This man says he's Moses!

575
00:52:33,409 --> 00:52:35,342
[Ira] The runaway prince.

576
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,312
You're wanted for murder.

577
00:52:40,348 --> 00:52:45,118
If you're who you say you are,
why would you return?

578
00:52:47,489 --> 00:52:50,324
God has sent me.

579
00:52:52,226 --> 00:52:54,527
I am here

580
00:52:54,662 --> 00:52:56,729
to set you free.

581
00:52:58,031 --> 00:52:59,965
[Laughs] God has sent you?

582
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:04,904
Yes, God sent me.
To speak to you.

583
00:53:07,174 --> 00:53:09,007
Have you forgotten God?

584
00:53:10,677 --> 00:53:12,678
Even if you have...

585
00:53:14,414 --> 00:53:16,615
He has not forgotten you.

586
00:53:16,749 --> 00:53:18,450
[Ira] In case you had forgotten,

587
00:53:18,585 --> 00:53:22,287
Pharaoh is the only God
we have to fear.

588
00:53:22,422 --> 00:53:24,689
And you think
he's just going to let us go?

589
00:53:24,823 --> 00:53:26,524
Who created the earth,

590
00:53:28,093 --> 00:53:29,527
sea,

591
00:53:29,661 --> 00:53:31,929
sky?

592
00:53:32,063 --> 00:53:33,764
Who created you?

593
00:53:35,867 --> 00:53:37,368
Pharaoh?

594
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:40,002
Or God?

595
00:53:40,137 --> 00:53:41,904
You're demented.

596
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:44,207
[Aaron] No!

597
00:53:45,209 --> 00:53:46,876
He isn't!

598
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:50,714
[Sighs]

599
00:53:50,848 --> 00:53:53,683
He's my brother.

600
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:54,751
Aaron.

601
00:53:56,586 --> 00:53:58,120
Moses!

602
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:06,262
God sent me a dream
to say you would return.

603
00:54:08,131 --> 00:54:10,432
This is Miriam, your sister.

604
00:54:12,568 --> 00:54:14,435
Brother.

605
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:19,206
My children.

606
00:54:25,414 --> 00:54:27,547
My family.

607
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:30,150
My people.

608
00:54:30,285 --> 00:54:32,152
Our people.

609
00:54:33,988 --> 00:54:37,090
- God's people!
- God's people!

610
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:43,462
Old Pharaoh may have
been fond of you.

611
00:54:43,597 --> 00:54:45,931
But it's his son
you'll have to deal with now.

612
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,669
Why would Pharaoh even see you?

613
00:54:49,803 --> 00:54:51,570
Oh...

614
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,619
He'll want to see me.

615
00:55:59,938 --> 00:56:02,205
You have a son.

616
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:05,842
An heir. Our dynasty
will last forever.

617
00:56:15,186 --> 00:56:17,253
Why are you here, Moses?

618
00:56:17,388 --> 00:56:19,955
Have you come to ask
for forgiveness?

619
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:21,957
No. No.

620
00:56:22,092 --> 00:56:25,194
God saved me for a purpose.

621
00:56:27,263 --> 00:56:29,565
Yes?

622
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,767
I come to demand

623
00:56:31,902 --> 00:56:35,536
that you release his people
from slavery.

624
00:56:37,506 --> 00:56:39,908
Demand?

625
00:56:40,042 --> 00:56:42,343
Let my people go.

626
00:56:42,477 --> 00:56:46,948
[Laughs] You always
were a fighter, Moses.

627
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:50,117
But you never knew
when you were beaten.

628
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:55,322
If you defy God,
you will be punished.

629
00:56:55,456 --> 00:57:00,560
You return, after all these
years, to threaten me?

630
00:57:00,695 --> 00:57:02,495
Tell me.

631
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:06,532
Is it your invisible God
that's going to punish me?

632
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:08,901
The one who abandons
his people?

633
00:57:09,036 --> 00:57:11,037
The one who runs
from his responsibilities,

634
00:57:11,171 --> 00:57:12,638
from his past?

635
00:57:12,773 --> 00:57:14,306
From his family?

636
00:57:17,077 --> 00:57:18,778
Teach them who God is.

637
00:57:22,681 --> 00:57:24,216
I am God!

638
00:57:26,285 --> 00:57:28,820
I am God!

639
00:57:46,104 --> 00:57:49,740
Moses! You've made
Pharaoh angry.

640
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:52,777
He will punish us.
Don't make it worse.

641
00:57:52,911 --> 00:57:55,378
God has spoken to me.

642
00:57:55,512 --> 00:57:58,047
He will force Pharaoh
to free us...

643
00:57:59,884 --> 00:58:01,584
If he has to.

644
00:58:01,718 --> 00:58:02,886
What should we do?

645
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,053
Sister. Brother.

646
00:58:05,188 --> 00:58:07,055
All of you.

647
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,658
Trust in God!

648
00:58:08,792 --> 00:58:10,959
Pharaoh is over there.

649
00:58:11,094 --> 00:58:13,796
If he didn't listen to you
when you were six feet away,

650
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:16,231
why would he hear you now?

651
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:23,405
You will see.

652
00:58:23,539 --> 00:58:25,807
Put your staff...

653
00:58:25,941 --> 00:58:27,642
To the water.

654
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,368
[Gasping]

655
00:59:11,384 --> 00:59:13,518
Master!

656
00:59:13,653 --> 00:59:17,823
Come out of the water!
There's blood! There's blood!

657
00:59:17,957 --> 00:59:20,925
There's blood! Blood everywhere!

658
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:22,828
- Your majesty!
- Swim to us!

659
00:59:22,962 --> 00:59:24,261
Master!

660
00:59:29,267 --> 00:59:31,469
You are not a God.

661
00:59:31,603 --> 00:59:34,004
You are just a man.

662
00:59:35,073 --> 00:59:39,042
And you will set my people free.

663
00:59:39,177 --> 00:59:40,910
Ah! Ah!

664
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,113
Ah!

665
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:46,115
Move away!

666
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:50,453
Moses!

667
00:59:53,591 --> 00:59:55,657
[Laughter]

668
00:59:58,227 --> 00:59:59,995
[Laughter]

669
01:00:03,165 --> 01:00:05,333
Do you doubt, Joshua?

670
01:00:07,871 --> 01:00:11,472
All my life,
I have been Pharaoh's.

671
01:00:14,276 --> 01:00:16,544
I will never be a slave again.

672
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:19,680
God is with us.

673
01:00:22,684 --> 01:00:25,453
This is just the beginning.

674
01:00:27,655 --> 01:00:30,123
[Abraham] Our Lord
is sending ten plagues

675
01:00:30,257 --> 01:00:32,258
to change Pharaoh's mind.

676
01:00:35,596 --> 01:00:37,464
Let my people go.

677
01:00:37,598 --> 01:00:39,132
No!

678
01:00:47,574 --> 01:00:48,774
No!

679
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,414
No!

680
01:01:01,153 --> 01:01:02,587
Locusts.

681
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:05,323
Come away! Master!

682
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:06,858
No!

683
01:01:06,992 --> 01:01:08,860
[Thunder]

684
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:12,730
[Thunder]

685
01:01:12,865 --> 01:01:14,799
[Low chatter]

686
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:27,444
[Aaron] Moses?

687
01:01:28,813 --> 01:01:31,781
What is Pharaoh's answer?
Surely he will see sense now?

688
01:01:31,915 --> 01:01:33,683
No.

689
01:01:34,785 --> 01:01:35,885
He refuses.

690
01:01:36,019 --> 01:01:36,986
Again?

691
01:01:37,754 --> 01:01:40,690
Give up, Moses,
before it's too late.

692
01:01:40,824 --> 01:01:43,058
God will keep on doing this

693
01:01:43,193 --> 01:01:45,595
until Pharaoh breaks.

694
01:01:50,633 --> 01:01:52,000
What's wrong?

695
01:01:53,369 --> 01:01:57,806
Soon there will be
a final plague.

696
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,808
The angel of death is coming.

697
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:03,077
Every firstborn son will die.

698
01:02:03,212 --> 01:02:04,512
No. Please.

699
01:02:04,646 --> 01:02:08,115
But not us?
Why would he punish us?

700
01:02:08,249 --> 01:02:10,518
Death is coming for us all.

701
01:02:10,652 --> 01:02:12,720
[Raised voices]

702
01:02:15,256 --> 01:02:16,624
Why us?

703
01:02:16,758 --> 01:02:18,959
[Raised voices]

704
01:02:27,823 --> 01:02:30,659
The angel of death is coming.

705
01:02:30,793 --> 01:02:32,928
Every firstborn son will die.

706
01:02:33,063 --> 01:02:34,363
No, please.

707
01:02:34,497 --> 01:02:37,999
But not us?
Why would he punish us?

708
01:02:38,134 --> 01:02:40,369
Death is coming for us all.

709
01:02:40,503 --> 01:02:43,037
[Raised voices]

710
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:45,440
Why us?

711
01:02:47,709 --> 01:02:49,777
Friends!

712
01:02:50,946 --> 01:02:54,582
We can be spared
God's vengeance,

713
01:02:54,716 --> 01:02:58,318
but only if we do
exactly as he tells us.

714
01:03:02,757 --> 01:03:03,891
Don't spill!

715
01:03:05,192 --> 01:03:07,426
Every single house must
be marked with blood.

716
01:03:07,561 --> 01:03:11,130
The Israelites paint lamb's
blood on their doorways,

717
01:03:11,264 --> 01:03:13,900
identifying them
as God's people.

718
01:03:28,047 --> 01:03:30,983
We promised God would
free our people,

719
01:03:31,117 --> 01:03:33,351
but now he sends us death.

720
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:36,454
We must trust in him.

721
01:03:36,589 --> 01:03:39,223
[Thunder]

722
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:55,338
It's coming.

723
01:03:56,674 --> 01:03:59,542
- Will we be safe?
- Don't be afraid, my son.

724
01:04:03,948 --> 01:04:05,915
God have mercy.

725
01:04:11,454 --> 01:04:13,122
[Joshua]
Pharaoh has not listened.

726
01:04:15,158 --> 01:04:18,393
Whatever happens to his people
is now on his head.

727
01:04:18,528 --> 01:04:21,730
Once I counted them
as my people, Joshua.

728
01:04:21,865 --> 01:04:24,566
Our freedom comes at a price.

729
01:04:25,267 --> 01:04:26,968
[Echoing whisper]

730
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:02,201
The angel of death

731
01:05:02,335 --> 01:05:06,205
finds every israelite house
painted with blood,

732
01:05:06,339 --> 01:05:08,407
and passes over.

733
01:05:17,616 --> 01:05:19,283
[Sighing]

734
01:05:43,141 --> 01:05:45,374
[Pharaoh] Why?

735
01:05:52,116 --> 01:05:53,482
Why?

736
01:05:55,018 --> 01:05:58,554
Why should israelite slaves
have life,

737
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:01,089
when my son is dead?

738
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:12,134
Get up.

739
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:14,369
Get up!

740
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:15,837
Go!

741
01:06:17,172 --> 01:06:20,340
And leave my land, and take
your wretched God with you!

742
01:06:28,116 --> 01:06:30,050
[Sobs]

743
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:33,653
Load up, get ready.

744
01:06:33,788 --> 01:06:35,922
Come on, do it.

745
01:06:37,925 --> 01:06:40,126
Moses!

746
01:06:40,261 --> 01:06:41,460
Moses!

747
01:06:41,595 --> 01:06:43,296
[Cheering]

748
01:06:47,168 --> 01:06:49,201
[Cheering]

749
01:06:52,205 --> 01:06:54,173
[Cheering]

750
01:07:11,556 --> 01:07:15,693
We are going to fulfill
Abraham's covenant with God.

751
01:07:15,828 --> 01:07:18,129
We're going to live
in the promised land

752
01:07:18,263 --> 01:07:22,799
with descendants
as numerous as the stars.

753
01:07:37,214 --> 01:07:38,914
[Murmuring]

754
01:07:51,394 --> 01:07:53,294
My son.

755
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,634
How could slaves do this?

756
01:08:12,446 --> 01:08:15,782
I vow to you, here and now,

757
01:08:15,917 --> 01:08:17,851
that I will bring
the Israelites back

758
01:08:17,986 --> 01:08:19,052
and make them build you

759
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:22,489
the greatest tomb
the world has ever seen.

760
01:08:31,999 --> 01:08:34,400
And Moses's body...

761
01:08:35,835 --> 01:08:38,570
Shall be buried
in its foundations.

762
01:08:50,106 --> 01:08:52,607
This is the exodus.

763
01:08:54,175 --> 01:08:58,245
After 400 years of slavery,
the Israelites are free.

764
01:09:15,296 --> 01:09:19,232
I still can't believe
Pharaoh just let us leave.

765
01:09:19,366 --> 01:09:21,334
- But he did.
- It's what God demanded.

766
01:09:21,469 --> 01:09:25,771
And only a madman would defy
God again after what he's done.

767
01:09:32,712 --> 01:09:35,448
[Aaron] Brother? What now?

768
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:38,450
Brother?

769
01:09:38,584 --> 01:09:40,251
God will provide a way.

770
01:09:41,554 --> 01:09:45,156
Moses. Why have you
brought us her

771
01:09:46,459 --> 01:09:48,726
God brought us here.

772
01:09:51,296 --> 01:09:54,098
And what does God say
about getting across?

773
01:10:10,048 --> 01:10:12,949
[Joshua] Egyptians, on the hill.

774
01:10:21,925 --> 01:10:23,659
Where is your God now, Moses?

775
01:10:24,761 --> 01:10:27,463
We have them! They're trapped!

776
01:10:27,597 --> 01:10:28,397
Die!

777
01:10:30,233 --> 01:10:31,700
Horses!

778
01:10:34,504 --> 01:10:36,438
Chariots! They're here!

779
01:10:37,607 --> 01:10:39,008
The Egyptians.

780
01:10:39,142 --> 01:10:41,943
Fool! What do we do now?

781
01:10:42,078 --> 01:10:44,045
Or is it because there
were no graves in Egypt

782
01:10:44,213 --> 01:10:46,481
that you brought us here to die?

783
01:10:46,615 --> 01:10:48,616
Because that is
what you've done!

784
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:50,851
[Man] They're coming!
What do we do?

785
01:10:50,986 --> 01:10:52,853
[Ira] Well?

786
01:10:56,425 --> 01:10:57,725
Moses?

787
01:10:57,859 --> 01:10:59,426
Yaah!

788
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,261
Yaah!

789
01:11:01,396 --> 01:11:02,496
Yaah!

792
01:11:22,082 --> 01:11:23,315
Moses!

793
01:11:24,551 --> 01:11:25,518
Lord, I cannot believe

794
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,421
this is the end
you planned for us.

795
01:11:28,555 --> 01:11:30,056
Yaah!

796
01:11:40,732 --> 01:11:43,501
We have watched you
bring terror on our enemies.

797
01:11:46,672 --> 01:11:48,905
Die!

798
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,875
You kept death from our door.

799
01:11:56,781 --> 01:11:58,449

800
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:07,056

Lord!

802
01:12:46,294 --> 01:12:48,762
Come on! Come on!

803
01:12:58,038 --> 01:13:00,340
God is with us!

804
01:13:00,474 --> 01:13:03,510

God is with us!

807
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:10,882
We're going to go
straight through there!

808
01:13:11,017 --> 01:13:13,051
Get your men together!

809
01:13:13,186 --> 01:13:14,853
Hurry, hurry!

810
01:13:14,987 --> 01:13:16,855
We have to leave now!

811
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:21,426
Light torches quickly!

812
01:13:21,561 --> 01:13:23,761
Let's move! Let's move!

813
01:13:23,895 --> 01:13:25,929
Let's move! Move it!

01:13:26,064 --> 01:13:29,233
- Let's move!
- Quickly! Hurry!

815
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:37,941
Have faith!

816
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,314
Come on!

Hurry!

819
01:13:53,558 --> 01:13:55,624
Don't be afraid!

820
01:13:55,758 --> 01:13:57,193
Have faith!

821
01:13:59,529 --> 01:14:02,731
- Come on!
- Come on! Keep going!

822
01:14:05,735 --> 01:14:07,469
We're nearly there!

823
01:14:07,604 --> 01:14:09,037
Wait!

824
01:14:19,515 --> 01:14:21,949
After them!

825
01:14:22,084 --> 01:14:23,951

01:16:49,292 --> 01:16:51,927
You are not a God, Pharaoh.

851
01:16:52,962 --> 01:16:54,930
There is only one God...

852
01:16:56,466 --> 01:16:58,701
And he is here

853
01:16:58,835 --> 01:17:00,535

My... People.

865
01:18:42,432 --> 01:18:46,135
God has delivered us
from slavery.

866
01:18:48,438 --> 01:18:50,239
We are free.

867
01:18:51,942 --> 01:18:54,375
You have come a long way.

868
01:18:54,509 --> 01:18:56,844
I know.

869
01:18:56,979 --> 01:18:59,713
But our journey
is just beginning.

870
01:19:00,816 --> 01:19:02,616
We must trust in God.

871
01:19:03,885 --> 01:19:07,555
We must follow his path.

872
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:15,862
Moses leads the Israelites
to mount sinai,

873
01:19:15,997 --> 01:19:19,967
where God first spoke to him
in the burning bush.

01:20:13,283 --> 01:20:17,720
God gives laws to Moses,
written in stone.

880
01:20:21,825 --> 01:20:24,193
The ten commandments.

Renewed the promise
he made to Abraham.

885
01:20:49,984 --> 01:20:54,688
We have new laws, preparing
us for the promised land.

886
01:20:54,822 --> 01:20:59,093
If we are true to God,
he will keep his promise.

887
01:20:59,227 --> 01:21:01,194
Abraham's dream.

888

You are our people's future,
Joshua.

890
01:21:07,668 --> 01:21:12,505
You must take the land
promised to Abraham

891
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:14,441
and all of his descendants,

892
01:21:15,943 --> 01:21:18,043

01:21:30,490 --> 01:21:33,791
I was with Moses when he
handed down these commandments.

895

I was witness to the covenant,

to inherit their land.

[Others] Aye.

903
01:22:20,427 --> 01:22:21,928
He promised us this land.

905
01:22:23,764 --> 01:22:25,296

We'll search the whole city.

910
01:22:41,212 --> 01:22:45,616
Just find me a way in.
We must take Jericho.

911
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:50,087
It's all that stands between
us and the promised land.

- Please.
- Go. Go. Stay indoors.

What are you doing out, hm?

- It's safe enough.

01:25:34,909 --> 01:25:36,544
If we obey the Lord,

940
01:25:36,678 --> 01:25:39,279
anything is possible!

941
01:25:40,348 --> 01:25:45,653
Saul, I anoint you
the first king of Israel.

942
01:25:45,787 --> 01:25:48,622
God is with me!

943
01:25:48,757 --> 01:25:51,992
Samson, your strength
comes from God.

944
01:25:53,194 --> 01:25:56,663
Your duty is to drive
the philistines away.

945
01:25:59,066 --> 01:26:01,734
[Uriah] David, the people
will look to you now

946
01:26:01,869 --> 01:26:04,671
to defend them, unite them.

947
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:08,607
Jerusalem, our new home.

948
01:26:08,742 --> 01:26:10,275
[Saul] When you have my crown,

949
01:26:10,409 --> 01:26:13,111
will you not kill
my descendants, bury my name?

950
01:26:13,245 --> 01:26:17,916
Wherever you go
I shall hunt you down!

951
01:26:21,921 --> 01:26:24,690
What the Lord gives
he can take away.

952
01:26:26,058 --> 01:26:27,224
What is your name?

953
01:26:27,358 --> 01:26:28,859
My name is Delilah.

954
01:26:30,062 --> 01:26:33,297
Your God has abandoned you,
Samson.

955
01:26:33,431 --> 01:26:35,632
And taken your strength
with him.

956
01:26:35,767 --> 01:26:39,670
No, he wants me
to destroy you all!

957
01:26:39,805 --> 01:26:41,572
The Lord told me
the house of David

958
01:26:41,706 --> 01:26:44,207
will rule Israel forever.

959
01:26:44,341 --> 01:26:46,309
Israel!

960
01:26:47,644 --> 01:26:49,813
There will be no more death,

961
01:26:50,815 --> 01:26:53,516
or mourning, or crying,

962
01:26:54,484 --> 01:26:55,115
or pain.

963
01:26:55,235 --> 01:26:57,946
