00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,183
Thoughts that have
important consequences

5
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,578
are always simple.

6
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,219
All my thinking could be
summed up with these words:

7
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:09,292
Since corrupt people
unite among themselves

8
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,789
to constitute a force,

9
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:16,263
honest people
must do the same.

10
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,632
It's as simple as that.

ST. PETERSBURG. 1805

45
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,621
The celebrated Anna Pavlovna
Scherer,

46
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,629
most intimate lady-in-waiting
of the Empress Maria Fedorovna,

47
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,768
gave at her home the receptions

48
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,903
which she alone had a gift
for organizing.

49
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,881
Tonight, Anna Pavlovna
was "treating" her guests

50
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,117
to a French aristocrat,
the Vicomte de Mortemart,

51
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:39,287
who'd taken refuge in Russia from
the Antichrist Napoleon Buonaparte.

52
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:56,547
The execution of Duke of Enghien
was a state necessity.

53
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,687
Napoleon is great, and
the Revolution was a great thing...

54
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,703
Excuse me,
my dear Vicomte,

55
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:22,702
but this unfortunate soiree
at the Ambassador's

56
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:28,546
deprives me of the pleasure
to hear you out.

57
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:35,619
It saddens me to have to leave
this delightful party.

58
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,201
Scherer's salon gathered together

59
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:56,866
"the flower of the intellectual
high society of St. Petersburg",

60
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,873
as Anna Pavlovna herself
described it.

61
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,213
It was here, during these soirees,

62
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:06,917
that could best be measured
the political temperature of

63
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:12,388
the official spheres in the capital
which were close to the Court.

64
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:21,529
My husband's planning to desert me,
he may be killed.

65
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,528
Tell me, why must we have
this wretched war?

66
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,233
Are you going off to the war,
Prince?

67
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,135
General Kutuzov has been kind
enough to take me as aide-de-camp.

68
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,076
- And what about Lisa, your wife?
- She will go to the country.

69
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:40,777
Oh, it's sinful of you to deprive
us of your charming wife.

70
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:47,621
Why can't men live
without wars?

71
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:50,892
Take us, women,
we don't want anything.

72
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,894
We don't need anything.

73
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:19,224
What have you done to MIle Scherer?
Now she's going to be really ill.

74
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:24,695
This abbe is an interesting man,
but he sees it in the wrong light.

75
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,562
I think the eternal peace is
possible,

76
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,463
but, I don't know how to express it,

77
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,866
only not through
political balance.

78
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,699
People should not say everywhere
what they think.

79
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,910
Have you made your mind at last?
The Imperial Guards or diplomacy?

80
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:44,775
I don't know yet.
I don't like to be either.

81
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,384
He must be a Freemason anyway.

82
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:51,045
Let's talk about serious things.
Have you been to the Cavalry?

83
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,918
No. But that's what occurred to me,
and I wanted to tell you about it.

84
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,290
Now we're at war with Napoleon.

85
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,533
If it were a liberation war,
I would have understood.

86
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,705
I would have been the first
to enlist.

87
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:11,900
But to help Britain and Austria to
fight the greatest man in the world

88
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,904
is not good.

89
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:18,674
If everybody fought for their
convictions, there would be no war.

90
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,511
That would be wonderful!

91
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:24,113
Perhaps,
but that would never happen.

92
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,885
Tell me, why are you going off
to the war?

93
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,160
Why?

94
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:36,899
I don't know.

95
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,229
I must go.

96
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,601
Besides, I'm going...

97
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,208
I'm going because I don't like
the life I'm leading here.

98
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,983
I have often wondered how is it
Annette never got married.

99
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,948
You're really stupid, all of you
men, not to have married her.

100
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,183
I'm sorry to say you don't
understand anything about women.

101
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:05,727
- You're such a debater, M. Pierre.
- I'm arguing with your husband.

102
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,297
I still can't understand why
he wants to go off to war.

103
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,361
When are you leaving?

104
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,376
When I realized that I'll have to
interrupt all those dear relations...

105
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,685
And what's more,
you know, Andrei...

106
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,881
Why are you afraid, Lisa?
I don't understand you.

107
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,292
All men are egotists.

108
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:39,897
Just for a whim, he's abandoning
me, shutting me up in the country.

109
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,294
With my sister and my father,
remember.

110
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:45,901
But without my friends, all alone!
And I shouldn't be afraid?

111
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,704
I still fail to understand
why you're so afraid.

112
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:00,210
Your doctor told you to go to bed
earlier. It's time you were asleep.

113
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,358
I don't mind talking in front of
Monsieur Pierre.

114
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,522
I've wanted to say this for months,
Andrei.

115
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:15,063
Why have you changed so much?
What have I done to you?

116
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,695
Why are you deserting me
to go off to war?

117
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,207
You've been treating me as though
I were a child or an invalid.

118
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,898
You weren't like this
six months ago.

119
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,873
I beg you to stop!

120
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:29,477
Please, don't get upset, Princess.
It's just your imagination,

121
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,139
because, I assure you...

122
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,752
I myself have felt that...
I know... because...

123
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,519
No, excuse me, an outsider
has no business here.

124
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,684
You mustn't get upset.

125
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,130
- Good night.
- Wait, Pierre.

126
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,528
The princess is too kind not to let
me enjoy your company.

127
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,066
- There! He only thinks of himself!
- Liz!

128
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:19,529
Never marry, my friend,
that is my advice to you.

129
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:23,691
Never marry till you can say to
yourself you've done everything,

130
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,304
till you have stopped loving the
woman whom you have chosen,

131
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,538
till you're able to see her clearly.

132
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,272
Otherwise you'll be making
a cruel and irrevocable mistake.

133
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,049
Marry when you are old
and good for nothing.

134
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,878
Or everything that is good and
noble in you will be lost.

135
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,678
It will all be wasted on trifles.

136
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,905
You say,
Buonaparte and his career.

137
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:07,308
But when he was working for
his goal, he was free.

138
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,377
He had nothing but his goal,
and he had achieved it.

139
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,315
And we have nothing but salons,
gossip, balls, vanity, nonentity.

140
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:17,455
The vicious circle
I can't break free of.

141
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:21,852
That's enough talk about me.

142
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,054
Shall we talk about you?

143
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,898
But what is there to say?
Who am I after all?

144
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:35,064
An illegitimate son,
without name and without fortune.

145
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:39,542
Of course, I have my freedom,
and I'm enjoying it.

146
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:43,381
Yet, I don't know what to take up,
I need some advice from you.

147
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:48,048
I'm very fond of you, because
you're the only one who's really

148
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:49,983
alive among our society.

149
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,883
You can pick anything you like,
the Imperial Guards, diplomacy.

150
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,118
You're going
to be all right everywhere.

151
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:01,690
But you shouldn't associate with the
Kuraghin set and their way of life.

152
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:06,634
It doesn't suit you,
the debauchery, the carousing.

153
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:10,036
Do you know what? Seriously,
I have long thought the same thing.

154
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,211
Leading that sort of life,
I can't decide anything properly.

155
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:18,545
I waste money and get headaches.
I won't go tonight.

156
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,878
Give me your word
that you won't be going there.

157
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,948
I promise.

158
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,394
Petrousha, dear friend,
come over here!

159
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:54,743
Get out, or they're going
to think I'm holding on!

160
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,514
You have a try, Hercules!

161
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,557
Wait! Kuraghin! Listen!

162
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:13,898
If anyone can do the same,
I'll pay him 100 imperials.

163
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,232
Do you understand?

164
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,023
Attention!

165
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,620
This is folly, gentlemen!
He'll get himself killed.

166
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,790
Don't startle him! Otherwise he's
sure to be killed, and what then?

167
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,287
The first who tries
to come close to me

168
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,464
is going to get pushed down.

169
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,289
It's empty!

170
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,471
Gentlemen!
I will do the same thing!

171
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,911
I will drink it up.
Bring me a bottle of rum!

172
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,906
I'll do it even without betting.

173
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,215
Let him do it!

174
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,686
You get dizzy just trying
to get upstairs, man.

175
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,888
Tell them to bring a bottle.
I'll do it.

176
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:51,151
Listen, I'll take your bet,
but we'll do it tomorrow.

177
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,696
And now we're going to pay
a visit to the actresses!

178
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:58,466
Let's go!
And we'll take Bruin with us too!

179
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,267
Prince Vassily is here.

180
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,446
Count Bezukhov must be
in a really bad state.

181
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,691
I feel so sorry for
poor Count Bezukhov.

182
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,691
His health is so wretched already

183
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,455
that the pranks of his son could
very well be the death of him.

184
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,529
What have they done now?

185
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,532
The three of them
dug up a bear somewhere

186
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,706
and took him in a carriage
to see the actresses.

187
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,704
They captured a policeman,

188
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,470
strapped him and the bear together
and threw them into the Moika.

189
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,773
The bear was swimming
with the officer riding him.

190
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,449
I can imagine, ma chere, what
a look the officer had on his face!

191
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:22,051
It's horrid! What's so funny
about it, Count?

192
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,881
Dolokhov has been reduced
to the ranks,

193
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,886
as for Anatole Kuraghin, his
father had the affair hushed up,

194
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,615
and Pierre Bezukhov has been
exiled to Moscow.

195
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,056
I hope no one in Moscow
will receive him.

196
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,457
I declined to do so,
most emphatically.

197
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:33,892
I have daughters.

198
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,067
Still, you know, ma chere,
it was a fine trick.

199
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,204
Just think of the figure that
police officer cut in the water!

200
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:47,444
Monsieur Pierre.

201
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,073
Here she is!
My pet, whose name-day it is!

202
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,070
You keep spoiling her, Ilya.

203
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,614
How are you, my dear?
Many happy returns!

204
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:29,678
- A charming child.
- Pure quick silver! Takes after me.

205
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,721
Yes, they're wonderful kids.

206
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:11,328
Sonya! What's the matter?
What's wrong?

207
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,590
- It's nothing. Leave me alone.
- Nothing matters in this world.

208
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,667
You alone are everything for me.
I'll prove it to you.

209
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:22,203
- I don't like it when you say so.
- I won't. Forgive me, Sonya.

210
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,467
It's so wonderful.

211
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,904
Boris, come over here.

212
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,510
I have to tell you something.

213
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,046
Over here.

214
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,455
I wonder what is this something.

215
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,364
Kiss the doll.

216
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:26,233
You don't want to?

217
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,705
Come on, come here.

218
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,615
Closer.

219
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,348
More closer.

220
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,302
Would you like to kiss me?

221
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,710
Let me congratulate you
on this occasion, my dear.

222
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:17,717
And you, old sinner,
feeling bored in Moscow?

223
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,881
There's nothing much you can do.

224
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,788
When your little birds grow up,
you have to get them husbands.

225
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,461
How are you, sweet little
Cossack of mine?

226
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,527
I know you're a rascal,
but I love you just the same.

227
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:44,311
Come here, my young friend.
Here, I said.

228
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:48,385
I used to tell your father the truth
when he needed to be told.

229
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:49,884
As for you, I feel it's my sacred
duty to do the same.

230
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,883
Some hero, isn't he?
A pretty kettle of fish indeed!

231
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,690
Your father lies on his death-bed
and you amuse yourself.

232
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,295
Tying a police officer
to the back of a bear!

233
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,897
Shame on you, dear!
You'd do better to go to war.

234
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:08,906
Well, now, I think,
it's time for dinner.

235
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:53,917
The manifesto on the declaration
of war has already been out.

236
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,684
I myself saw it in St. Petersburg.

237
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:59,049
It's been delivered to
the commander-in-chief in Moscow.

238
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:03,386
Why in the devil should we go
to war against Bonaparte?

239
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:08,022
He has cut down Austria to size,
it's going to be our turn next.

240
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:13,795
It's for the reason, my dear sir,
that the Emperor knows what to do.

241
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:20,444
Well, Yeryoma,
you'd be better off staying home,

242
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,707
fixing your spinning wheels.

243
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,506
This befits us better.

244
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:28,117
We always have to fight
to the last drop of our blood

245
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,687
and die for our Emperor.

246
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,291
And then everything
will be all right.

247
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:45,696
The less we debate
this thing the better.

248
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,065
That's what old Hussars think.

249
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,768
And what do you think,

250
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:54,309
young man and young Hussar?

251
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,646
I agree with you absolutely.

252
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,540
I'm convinced that Russians
must either die or win.

253
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,382
That's a real Hussar speaking,
young man!

254
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,523
What are you making such a row
about there?

255
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,484
Why are knocking on the table?
Who are you angry with?

256
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:12,060
As though you're confronting
the French.

257
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:13,787
I'm telling the truth.

258
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,594
We're talking about the war.
My son is going off.

259
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:22,803
I have four sons in the army,
and I don't worry.

260
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,642
It's all in God's hands.

261
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,906
One may die in one's bed, or God
may save you on the battlefield.

262
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:31,943
Yes, that's true.

263
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,885
You know that
I have sent for Pierre?

264
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:47,454
The Count, by pointing at his
portrait, demanded to see him.

265
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,369
There's something I've kept
praying for, my dear cousin,

266
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,139
that God might be
merciful to the Count,

267
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,468
and might allow his noble soul
to leave this earth in peace.

268
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,370
Yes, of course.

269
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:07,651
But the point is, as you know, that
the Count has made out a will,

270
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:13,321
leaving all
of his property to Pierre.

271
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,993
He's made out many other wills.

272
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:19,130
He can't bequeath everything to
Pierre. He's illegitimate.

273
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:22,456
Can't you see the point, Katish?

274
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,894
You're an intelligent woman!
Can't you see

275
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:28,072
that if the Count
wrote to the Czar

276
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:31,037
begging him
to legitimize his son,

277
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:34,871
that means that Pierre
will become Count Bezukhov.

278
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,448
And according to the will,
he'll get everything.

279
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,877
Mama told me
to ask you to dance.

280
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,917
I'm afraid of getting the steps
all mixed up.

281
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,622
However, if you don't mind
being my teacher...

282
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,687
Semyon! The Daniel Cooper!
You know it?

283
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:28,024
Look at Papa!
Look at Papa!

284
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:34,136
Look at the Master.
He's a real eagle, isn't he?

285
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:14,060
Pray to our Lord!

286
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:25,065
O Lord, have mercy!

287
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,042
O Lord Almighty,

288
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:35,618
the Father of our Lord,
Jesus Christ,

289
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,885
stretch forth Thy
all-honorable hand

290
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,853
on Your servant Kirill.

291
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,597
We pray Thee and implore Thee,
absolve Thou the soul

292
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:52,770
of Thy servant Kirill
from every bond.

293
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,599
Pardon his transgressions, both
of knowledge and of ignorance.

294
00:32:56,407 --> 00:33:02,141
And unto Thee do we ascribe glory
now and ever and unto ages of ages.

295
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,778
Amen!

296
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:14,789
O Lord, have mercy!
O Lord, have mercy!

297
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:06,043
If the Count didn't ask for me,
I'd better go home.

298
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:10,544
My friend, I'm suffering as much
as you are, but try to be a man.

299
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:33,469
Man's earthly life has limits and
these limits cannot be exceeded.

300
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:38,601
There's never been a case that
one has lived after the 3rd stroke.

301
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,376
What an iron constitution he had!
Who's going to inherit all this?

302
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,672
It will not go begging.

303
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:58,220
Have courage. He has summoned
you here and that's good.

304
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,451
Some water?

305
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,286
Pierre?

306
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,560
Would you like us to call
Prince Vassily?

307
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,225
The master wants to be moved
over on his side.

308
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:19,503
For I am in trouble, and receive
Thou my soul and deliver it.

309
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,905
Ye who are my kinfolk
in the flesh,

310
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,083
and ye who are my brethren
in the spirit,

311
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:31,950
my friends and wonted
acquaintances,

312
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,614
weep ye, sigh, wail;

313
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:40,991
for Io, now I am departing
from you.

314
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,069
Let go, I tell you!

315
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:27,144
I'll take the responsibility. You
don't know what you're doing.

316
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,608
- You vile woman.
- Let go!

317
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:33,912
What are you doing? He's about
to die and you leave me here alone!

318
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:18,459
Yes, you've been waiting for that.
You may rejoice now.

319
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,909
Ah, my friend.

320
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:50,622
We sin, we cheat.

321
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,888
And what is the point?

322
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,892
I'm already in my 50s, my friend...

323
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,539
We'll all die.

324
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,209
Death is horrible.

325
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:21,890
He is no more.

326
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,699
Come on, I'll see you out.

327
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,199
Try to cry. Nothing
gives better relief than tears.

328
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:44,881
God will be with you.

329
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:48,044
You are young and now, I hope,
you've come into possession

330
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:49,981
of a big fortune.

331
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:27,741
Ever since Czar Paul I has exiled
him to his estate,

332
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:31,683
the General-in-Chief, Prince
Nikolai Andreyevich Bolkonsky,

333
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:36,554
nicknamed in high society
"The King of Prussia",

334
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,994
had never left his estate property
"Bald Hills"

335
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,532
where he dwelt with his daughter,
Princess Maria.

336
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:43,116
Are you well? Sit down.

337
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,455
For tomorrow...

338
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,293
Wait, there's a letter for you.

339
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,903
- From Eloise?
- Yes, it's from Julie.

340
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,547
I'm going to let you have two more
letters, the third one I'll read.

341
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:07,115
I'm afraid, you're writing
a lot of nonsense.

342
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:11,277
- You may read this, Father.
- I said, the third!

343
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,690
Well, young lady...

344
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,628
These triangles are similar.

345
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:23,964
As you can see, the sides A, B
and C of a triangle...

346
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:28,234
The strict order of life at Bald
Hills could not be broken

347
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:33,904
even by such an event as
saying goodbye to his son.

348
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,880
It's so much like him...

349
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,915
What an intelligent man
is your father.

350
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:44,213
Perhaps, that's the reason I'm so
afraid of him.

351
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:16,550
Please, sit down.

352
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,454
Be seated, Mikhail Ivanovich.

353
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:34,866
You should walk
as much as possible.

354
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:14,101
Against your will,
He will save you and have mercy

355
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,036
and will turn you to Himself,

356
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:22,314
because only in Him
you'll find truth and comfort.

357
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,965
Please, take it, Andrei,
for my sake.

358
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:15,697
- You're going?
- I came to say goodbye.

359
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:18,905
Kiss me.

360
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:23,873
Thank you.

361
00:46:24,915 --> 00:46:26,678
Why do you thank me?

362
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:31,317
Because you're not wasting time,
hanging on to the woman's skirt.

363
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:36,286
Service before everything.
Thank you very much.

364
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:41,893
If you have anything to say, speak.
I can do two things at one time.

365
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:46,903
It's my wife. I'm sorry to leave her
on your hands.

366
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:49,703
Nonsense. Tell me what you want.

367
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:55,271
When it's time for her to deliver,
could you send for an obstetrician?

368
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,880
I know nothing can be done if
Nature doesn't condescend to yield.

369
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:01,676
I agree that out of a million cases
only one goes amiss.

370
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,511
But she's worried
and it so happens I am too.

371
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,960
She's heard stories, had
nightmares and she's afraid.

372
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,294
I'll do it.

373
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:27,976
It's bad, isn't it?

374
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,878
- What is bad, father?
- The wife!

375
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:33,280
I don't understand you.

376
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:42,683
There's nothing you can do,
my friend. They're all like that.

377
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:50,199
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.
And you know it yourself.

378
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:54,903
But you can't help it.
She's beautiful!

379
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,906
I'll do everything. Don't worry.

380
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,614
Give this letter to
Mikhail Illarionovich.

381
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:10,881
I'm asking him not to use you
as aide-de-camp for too long.

382
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:12,680
It's very ugly work!

383
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:17,219
You'll tell him he enjoys
my admiration and affection.

384
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,127
Write me how he's welcomed you.

385
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:28,605
Stay with him if he's worthy.

386
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:34,239
Nikolai Andreyevich Bolkonsky's
son doesn't need any favors.

387
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,540
Now come here.

388
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,283
My time will come
before yours does.

389
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,050
Here are some notes I've written.
Make sure the Czar gets them.

390
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,288
Here's a letter of credit and one
for the Academy.

391
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:54,293
The prize will go to the man
who is to write the story of

392
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:55,897
Suvorov's campaigns.

393
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:07,102
Here are a few personal jottings.

394
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:10,272
Read them when I'm gone.
You'll find them worth your while.

395
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:12,274
I'll carry out all your
instructions, Father.

396
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:17,511
And now goodbye!

397
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,617
But remember, Prince Andrei,

398
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:54,223
should you die on the battlefield,
your old father will mourn for you.

399
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:10,631
But should I hear you've behaved
not like Nikolai Bolkonsky's son,

400
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,899
I will be ashamed!

401
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:16,974
You need not have
said that to me, Father.

402
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:19,614
There's something else
I wanted to ask you.

403
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:23,210
If I am killed
and if I have a son,

404
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:26,689
would you keep him here with you?

405
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:31,288
Let him grow up under your roof.
Please.

406
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:37,757
Not to give him to your wife?

407
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:49,073
We've already said goodbye.
You may go.

408
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:56,112
Go!

409
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:20,202
Under the command of Kutuzov,
the Russian army, 50,000 strong,

410
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:23,370
marched into Austria

411
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:27,202
to join forces with the allied army
of the Austrian General Mack,

412
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:31,771
to undertake joint action
against Napoleon.

413
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:51,128
They say Kutuzov is one-eyed.

414
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,461
Sure thing! Absolutely one-eyed!

415
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:59,269
No, pal, he sees better'n you do.
Checked everything: Boots, puttees.

416
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:02,877
When he looked at my feet,
I thought I'm done...

417
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:08,275
I wish we had a rest 'fore marching
another 5 versts without a bite...

418
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:11,613
Germans provided carriages. We
used to ride like some big shots.

419
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:17,225
Poles, they also of the Russian
crown. Now there're only Germans.

420
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:19,354
Singers, up front!

421
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:32,197
Hey, you senny, Russian senny,
new-made entrance to my home,

422
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:36,311
Brand-new senny, all of maple
and of lattice handiwork.

423
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:40,209
Through these senny I will pass

424
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:44,046
Arm-in-arm with my sweet lass.

425
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:48,048
Here comes a fair maid
outside the new-made gate,

426
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:51,989
Brand-new gate of pure oak
and of lattice handiwork.

427
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:55,891
She would let a falcon out,
of her right sleeve he'll flutter out.

428
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:59,694
Fly on, falcon,
high and far!

429
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:03,604
Go on flying
high and far,

430
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:07,299
Very high and very far
to my dear home town,

431
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,704
To my dear home town!

432
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:16,576
Good morning!

433
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:25,585
Hurrah for the Austrians!
Hurrah for the Russians!

434
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:31,223
Hurrah for the whole world!

435
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:39,973
Well, what is it, Prince?

436
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:42,701
We've got orders to write a paper
explaining why we're not advancing.

437
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:45,982
And why aren't we?
No news from Mack?

438
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:51,887
If Mack's been defeated
and the allied forces destroyed,

439
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:53,885
we would have known about it.

440
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,387
Perhaps.

441
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,528
I'd like to see Commander-in-Chief
Kutuzov.

442
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:02,898
The Commander-in-Chief is engaged.
Whom shall I announce?

443
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:07,470
General Kutuzov is busy!

444
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:09,696
You see before you
the unfortunate General Mack.

445
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:55,201
- Why do you look so gloomy?
- There's nothing to rejoice about.

446
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:02,110
Step back. Make way.

447
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:12,627
My congratulations!
General Mack is here.

448
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:18,994
He is in good health, but
a little bit knocked down up there.

449
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,907
Sir, if you prefer to be a clown,

450
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,354
I cannot do anything to stop you.

451
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:40,887
But I'm warning you

452
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:44,685
that if you dare buffooning
in my presence again

453
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,897
I'll have to teach you good manners!

454
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:51,225
- I only congratulated.
- I'm notjoking!

455
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:57,032
Come on, dear, what is it with you?

456
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:02,710
Can't you see? We're either officers
serving our Czar and Fatherland,

457
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:05,710
rejoicing over our common success
or mourning our common failure,

458
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:08,611
or we're lackeys who don't give
a damn about the master's affairs.

459
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:12,521
Forty thousand people have died,
our ally's army has been destroyed,

460
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:14,280
and you are able to joke about it.

461
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,891
Only silly kids can amuse
themselves in this way.

462
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:37,877
Isn't it charming how the Gascons
show what they're made of? Well?

463
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:42,048
Three of them go
and seize a bridge.

464
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:49,056
The French cross the bridge and
their army gets across the Danube.

465
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:55,054
But if the French have crossed
the Thabor Bridge,

466
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:59,895
that means Kutuzov's army is
cut off, it is doomed!

467
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:02,805
That's what it looks like.

468
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:11,380
Wait, I have some plans for you
for this evening.

469
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,876
She is delightful, isn't she?

470
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:20,949
Happy is the man
who will possess her.

471
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:24,393
With her, the most unworldly
husband would automatically take

472
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,587
a prominent position in society,
don't you think so?

473
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:33,291
- I wanted to know your opinion.
- Yes, yes, she's beautiful.

474
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,541
Well, goodbye, Prince.

475
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:41,299
And God protect you.

476
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,910
May your great endeavor succeed.
You have my blessing.

477
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:01,894
Get in with me.

478
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:07,058
Permit me to stay in
General Bagration's detachment.

479
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:10,433
Get in. I also need good officers
on my staff.

480
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:16,968
I also need them.

481
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,290
There's still much to be done.
Much to be gone through.

482
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:40,698
Should just one tenth of Bagration's
soldiers return tomorrow,

483
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:43,729
I'll be grateful to Almighty God.

484
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:46,704
That's why I'd like to be assigned
to this detachment.

485
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:23,872
With 4,000 exhausted men,
Bagration had been entrusted

486
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:28,908
to delay the entire enemy army
for twenty-four hours.

487
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:31,513
This respite was
indispensable to Kutuzov

488
01:01:31,721 --> 01:01:34,690
in order for him to get his
transport-burdened army

489
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:39,324
out of reach of the French troops,
outnumbering his own three to one.

490
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:23,529
Gentlemen, what does this mean?
You can't leave your posts!

491
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:27,910
Take you, Captain.

492
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,206
You should be ashamed of
yourself, Captain Tushin.

493
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:35,714
An officer should set a good
example, and where're your boots?

494
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,387
If the alarm were sounded,
you'd be in your stocking feet!

495
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:42,584
Wouldn't that be a pretty sight?

496
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:45,555
So return to your posts,
gentlemen.

497
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,787
The soldiers say you go faster
without boots on.

498
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:50,993
Will you return to your posts?

499
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:05,237
It was getting closer and closer,
that special moment,

500
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:11,218
for which so much work had been
done and so much hardship endured,

501
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:17,623
for which soldiers had been drilled
for fifteen years,

502
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,891
homes and families left,

503
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:24,462
and a peasant turned
into a warrior,

504
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:30,905
for which 80,000 men lived in the
field, without wives and children,

505
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:35,035
without participation
in the affairs of civil life,

506
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:40,506
moving through
a strange, unknown country.

507
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:44,312
They lived in the fields,
on the roads, in the woods,

508
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,051
neglecting all the amenities

509
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:52,558
of a habitual human life.

510
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:58,063
For all those men, a road was
not the way to their family,

511
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,259
pleasures or work,

512
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:03,235
but a way of bypassing or attacking,

513
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:07,139
a house was not the hearth and home,
but the ambush position,

514
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:09,243
people were not their brothers,

515
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:15,210
but the tools
and the necessary victims of death.

516
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:22,923
No, my friend,
if a man could know

517
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:25,684
what would be after his death,

518
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:34,293
none of us would fear death.

519
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:38,530
That's how it is, my friend.

520
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:48,275
Fear it or not,
you won't escape it.

521
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:52,153
But you fear it anyway...

522
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,515
There, you smart people.

523
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:59,695
You artillerymen are so smart

524
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:03,627
because you can take everything
with you, both vodka and snacks.

525
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:07,697
And still you fear.

526
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:15,973
Uncertainty, that's what one fears
most.

527
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:20,215
Though they say that your soul
will go to Heaven...

528
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:27,612
We know there's no Heaven,
it's all just the atmosphere.

529
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:31,953
Come on, give us a taste of
your herbal vodka, Tushin.

530
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,231
With my pleasure.

531
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:45,537
And yet, to fathom your future
life...

532
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:51,775
It has begun! Here it is!

533
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,696
It has begun! The battle!
It's terrible, but glorious!

534
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,218
It has begun! That's it!

535
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,920
It has begun! That's it!

536
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:55,973
Two points up should do it.
Load, Medvedev!

537
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:00,282
Schoengraben is burning!

538
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:25,607
Please, Your Highness,
come away from here.

539
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:28,905
Please, Your Highness!
For God's sake!

540
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:30,907
Can't you see what's happening?

541
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:49,561
The French!

542
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,532
Fine looking soldiers.

543
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,448
Left, left...

544
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:16,517
Left, left...

545
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,690
Left, left...

546
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:46,111
Left, left...

547
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:53,761
Close in!

548
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:10,702
Battalion, halt!

549
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,278
Down knapsacks!

550
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:05,127
God be with us!

551
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:38,610
What is it? I don't move,
I fell, I'm killed.

552
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:06,710
There are people coming.
They will help me.

553
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:11,545
Who are these people?
They can't be the French.

554
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:19,992
O God, You who's in this sky,
forgive, save and protect me.

555
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:24,221
Are they coming to me?

556
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,626
Why?

557
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,597
To kill me?
Yes, they may kill me.

558
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:31,336
Me, who is loved by everyone?

559
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:48,119
It's impossible
that they would want to kill me!

560
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:11,138
Captain Tushin's battery had been
forgotten.

561
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:14,645
The troops assigned to cover it
had withdrawn.

562
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:17,750
The enemy could not conceive
that anyone would be so foolhardy

563
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:20,079
as to go on fighting
with four unprotected guns.

564
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:21,745
On the contrary, the French
supposed that it was here,

565
01:14:21,924 --> 01:14:25,519
in the center, that the main Russian
forces were concentrated.

566
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:33,696
- Gentlemen, everyone fall back.
- Fall back everyone!

567
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:16,539
- What shall we fire, Captain?
- Nothing. A shell!

568
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:22,874
Fire!

569
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:34,556
All right, my little old lady,
don't let me down!

570
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:46,370
What do you know! Firing again.

571
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:50,776
Captain Tushin! Captain!

572
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:56,942
Have you gone mad? Haven't you
been ordered twice to fall back?

573
01:15:58,153 --> 01:15:59,780
I just... I...

574
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:05,393
Fall back! Everybody fall back!

575
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:17,463
Your Excellency!
Here are two trophies.

576
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:21,268
I've captured a French officer,
the whole company's a witness!

577
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:22,841
Very well.

578
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:26,204
Remember, Your Excellency,
I'm Dolokhov, reduced in rank!

579
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:30,446
I received a bayonet wound!
Stayed right up at the front!

580
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:33,052
Remember,
Your Excellency!

581
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:21,536
Captain Tushin,
you've been ordered to fall back.

582
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,155
Well, goodbye.

583
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:55,134
Goodbye, my friend.
Goodbye, dear man.

584
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:13,119
Captain, for God's sake,
I've been contused in the arm.

585
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:16,518
For God's sake, I can't walk.
Give orders to put me on the cart.

586
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:20,285
Put him on.

587
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:25,060
Spread the coat, man.

588
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:27,294
Get on.

589
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:42,473
The thirty-five thousand men
of Kutuzov's army

590
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:45,877
were saved.

591
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:50,383
The next day the French army
did not renew its assault

592
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:56,756
and what was left of Bagration's
detachmentjoined Kutuzov's army.

593
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:25,350
- Does it hurt?
- Cut it out, for Christ's sake.

594
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:33,701
That's a lot of cripples
for one day's action.

595
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:41,374
Captain, you're wanted by
the general. He's in that house.

596
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:59,325
I thank you all, gentlemen.

597
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:03,891
How did it happen that the gun
was abandoned?

598
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:07,897
I don't know, Your Excellency.

599
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:15,239
I had no men,
Your Excellency.

600
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:17,912
You might have picked some up in
the column that was covering you.

601
01:20:20,248 --> 01:20:23,615
Tushin did not say that
he had no covering troops,

602
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:26,313
although this was the absolute
truth.

603
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:31,157
He was afraid of getting
some other officer into trouble.

604
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:33,625
Your Excellency!

605
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:38,299
You sent me to Captain Tushin's
battery today.

606
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:42,370
I found two thirds of his men
and his horses knocked out,

607
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:45,301
two of his guns disabled,
and no covering troops at all.

608
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:48,899
And if Your Excellency will
permit me to give my opinion,

609
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:52,274
we owe today's success mainly
to the action of that battery

610
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,108
and the heroic endurance of
Captain Tushin and his company.

611
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:12,295
Captain Tushin, you can go.

612
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:27,607
Thank you very much, my friend.
You really saved me.

613
01:21:53,808 --> 01:21:55,036
Thanks very much.

614
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:04,611
Yesterday at the meeting of
the Imperial Council,

615
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,515
our new governor-general,
Sergei Kuzmich,

616
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:11,792
was reading the Czar's rescript
from the army.

617
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:14,228
The rescript starts with the words:

618
01:22:14,996 --> 01:22:21,128
"Sergei Kuzmich, I have been
hearing rumors on all sides..."

619
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:23,702
Poor Count, he managed to get
as far, that's all.

620
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:25,873
He never got any further
than "Sergei Kuzmich"?

621
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:27,668
No, not one iota further.

622
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:34,075
"Sergei Kuzmich"...
On all sides, "Sergei Kuzmich"...

623
01:22:34,316 --> 01:22:36,284
Everything is going well.

624
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:38,452
He would try again
several times,

625
01:22:38,653 --> 01:22:42,555
but as soon as he said "Sergei",
he would choke,

626
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:46,392
at "Kuzmich", he would sob,

627
01:22:46,928 --> 01:22:51,058
and "on all sides"
would be drowned in tears.

628
01:22:54,002 --> 01:22:57,199
Then he'd start again...

629
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:00,469
It's time I understood her,

630
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:03,109
and made up my mind
what she really is.

631
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:06,877
Was I mistaken before?
Or am I mistaken now?

632
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:11,274
No, she's not stupid.
She's beautiful.

633
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:52,226
Are you pleased with this evening?

634
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:57,527
This celebration of my name-day
was one of the most pleasant.

635
01:24:07,642 --> 01:24:09,542
It's quite late, I...

636
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,920
Well, Helen?

637
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:28,060
"Sergei Kuzmich on all sides..."

638
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:58,052
Of course, it's a very brilliant
match, but happiness, my dear...

639
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:00,784
Marriages are made in heaven.

640
01:25:04,999 --> 01:25:06,694
"Sergei Kuzmich..."

641
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:14,299
What's the point of that story?
I don't think I got it.

642
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:16,706
I didn't either.

643
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:20,906
Aline, why don't you go and see
what they're doing.

644
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:47,772
Still the same.

645
01:26:05,093 --> 01:26:08,460
Heaven be praised.
My wife has told me everything.

646
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:11,465
Helen, my dear!

647
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:15,029
I'm so happy.

648
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:20,906
I loved your father so much.

649
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:24,907
You couldn't get a better wife.

650
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:30,212
God bless you, my children!

651
01:26:31,586 --> 01:26:35,386
Princess, come here, quickly!

652
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:46,130
My child, God bless you.

653
01:27:10,258 --> 01:27:11,452
Helen.

654
01:27:22,103 --> 01:27:25,231
Oh, take those off...
Those...

655
01:27:48,329 --> 01:27:50,957
Now it's too late. It's done.

656
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:54,358
But I do love her.

657
01:28:03,011 --> 01:28:06,708
The battle of Austerlitz was called
at the time

658
01:28:07,415 --> 01:28:09,383
"The battle of the three Emperors".

659
01:28:10,485 --> 01:28:15,787
The Emperors of Russia and Austria
were inspecting the allied armies.

660
01:29:03,938 --> 01:29:07,237
What are we to do if Napoleon
takes the offensive?

661
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:10,476
It is unlikely.

662
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:34,532
Gentlemen, the dispositions for
tomorrow, or rather today,

663
01:29:35,737 --> 01:29:37,705
for now it is after midnight,

664
01:29:38,005 --> 01:29:40,132
simply can't be changed.

665
01:29:41,476 --> 01:29:44,502
You know them,
and we shall do our duty.

666
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:51,917
And before the battle, the most
important thing is a good sleep.

667
01:30:11,172 --> 01:30:13,902
Yes, tomorrow, tomorrow.

668
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:17,903
I have a feeling that tomorrow
for the first time

669
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:21,105
I shall have a chance
to show all I can do.

670
01:30:26,721 --> 01:30:29,690
Mikhail Illarionovich, what do you
think of tomorrow's battle?

671
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:36,530
I think
that the battle will be lost.

672
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,896
I said so to Count Tolstoy, and
I asked him to tell the Czar.

673
01:31:11,265 --> 01:31:12,698
I want glory.

674
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:16,895
I want to be known to men,
to be loved by people.

675
01:31:17,738 --> 01:31:22,903
It's not my fault I want that
and live only for that.

676
01:31:24,345 --> 01:31:25,903
Yes, for that alone!

677
01:31:36,724 --> 01:31:40,285
I shall never tell anyone about
that. But what am I to do?

678
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:44,392
Death, wounds, the loss of my
family, nothing frightens me.

679
01:31:44,565 --> 01:31:47,898
I'd give everything for a moment of
glory, for an instant of triumph,

680
01:31:48,102 --> 01:31:51,230
for the love of men
I don't even know.

681
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:10,114
And what if there were nothing
left but to die?

682
01:32:11,826 --> 01:32:13,794
Well, if I had to,

683
01:32:16,097 --> 01:32:18,122
I should do that as well as anyone.

684
01:32:47,795 --> 01:32:49,763
Your Excellency,
your orders have been executed.

685
01:32:50,998 --> 01:32:53,592
What are they doing?

686
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:03,039
Good morning,
Your Excellency!

687
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:11,908
Attention!

688
01:33:18,726 --> 01:33:21,126
Why don't you begin,
Mikhail Illarionovich?

689
01:33:23,497 --> 01:33:30,699
I'm waiting, Sire. Not all the
columns have had time to form up.

690
01:33:31,706 --> 01:33:34,072
We're not at a parade,
Mikhail Illarionovich,

691
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:37,210
where they don't begin
until everyone's there.

692
01:33:39,013 --> 01:33:42,779
That is exactly why I wait, Sire,
because it's not a parade

693
01:33:42,984 --> 01:33:44,952
and we're not at Tsaritsyn Field.

694
01:33:51,158 --> 01:33:54,889
However, if such is your command,
Your Majesty...

695
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:05,718
At five o'clock that afternoon,

696
01:36:07,728 --> 01:36:12,756
the battle was irretrievably lost
on all fronts.

697
01:36:13,634 --> 01:36:15,864
- The enemy's there.
- No!

698
01:36:16,337 --> 01:36:17,702
Look!

699
01:36:19,106 --> 01:36:21,301
That's it, men!

700
01:36:21,475 --> 01:36:23,102
Hold it! Where are you going?

701
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:25,377
Are you wounded?

702
01:36:26,814 --> 01:36:31,046
My real wound is over there.
Stop them!

703
01:36:35,556 --> 01:36:38,354
Oh, Bolkonsky, what's going on?

704
01:36:50,738 --> 01:36:52,365
Forward, boys!

705
01:37:56,937 --> 01:38:00,373
How quiet it is. How peaceful

706
01:38:02,943 --> 01:38:04,706
and yet how majestic.

707
01:38:06,647 --> 01:38:10,208
It's so different from all
the charging and shouting we made.

708
01:38:14,655 --> 01:38:18,216
How is it that I'd never noticed
this boundless sky before?

709
01:38:20,094 --> 01:38:22,892
And how happy I am to have
found it at last!

710
01:38:23,998 --> 01:38:31,131
Yes, all is vanity and deception,
except that boundless sky.

711
01:38:33,007 --> 01:38:36,204
There is nothing, nothing,
except that.

712
01:38:40,314 --> 01:38:42,680
But perhaps even this sky
does not exist,

713
01:38:44,485 --> 01:38:50,390
perhaps there is nothing at all
but stillness and peace.

714
01:38:51,492 --> 01:38:52,891
God be praised!

715
01:39:04,405 --> 01:39:06,600
That's a beautiful death.

716
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:13,832
End of Part One

717
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:18,901
PART TWO

718
01:41:13,567 --> 01:41:15,694
Denissov! We're home!

719
01:42:17,164 --> 01:42:19,689
Nicky!

720
01:42:21,502 --> 01:42:22,799
Nicky!

721
01:42:24,338 --> 01:42:28,900
Candles! Tea! I didn't expect!
Nicky, my dear!

722
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:32,203
What about me?

723
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:02,200
Vassily Denissov.
Your son's friend.

724
01:43:02,809 --> 01:43:04,777
Welcome!

725
01:43:05,646 --> 01:43:08,376
I know, Nicky wrote about you.

726
01:43:08,916 --> 01:43:11,350
Natasha, Vera, here's Denissov.

727
01:43:12,586 --> 01:43:14,986
We are happy to meet you.

728
01:43:16,423 --> 01:43:18,823
Oh, how good it is. Splendid!

729
01:43:48,155 --> 01:43:50,123
Princess Maria!

730
01:43:56,096 --> 01:43:58,064
Andrei?

731
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:12,708
I've just got news. He's not
a prisoner, nor is his body found.

732
01:44:19,653 --> 01:44:23,680
Kutuzov writes me...
he was killed.

733
01:44:37,638 --> 01:44:42,439
Father, don't turn away.
Let's weep together.

734
01:44:46,179 --> 01:44:48,773
The scoundrels! The murderers!

735
01:44:50,083 --> 01:44:53,450
They destroy the army,
the people. What for?

736
01:44:57,724 --> 01:45:00,693
Go and tell Lisa.

737
01:45:21,648 --> 01:45:25,049
Father, tell me
how it happened.

738
01:45:26,853 --> 01:45:28,445
Go on.

739
01:45:30,557 --> 01:45:32,184
Killed on the battlefield where

740
01:45:32,492 --> 01:45:37,293
the best Russian men and Russian
glory were led to their death.

741
01:45:38,932 --> 01:45:42,527
Go on, Princess Maria! Go and
tell Lisa. I'll be right with you.

742
01:45:56,016 --> 01:45:59,918
Marie, let me have your hand.

743
01:46:07,994 --> 01:46:11,293
There... Do you feel it?

744
01:46:13,734 --> 01:46:15,702
It feels so strange.

745
01:46:16,937 --> 01:46:20,896
And you know, Marie,
I'm going to love him so much.

746
01:46:28,315 --> 01:46:29,873
What's the matter, Marie?

747
01:46:38,558 --> 01:46:40,116
Nothing.

748
01:46:42,662 --> 01:46:46,894
I just feel sad.
Feel sad about Andrei.

749
01:46:48,235 --> 01:46:50,260
Have you got any news from him?

750
01:46:52,172 --> 01:46:58,543
No. You know it's too early
to get any news.

751
01:46:58,945 --> 01:47:01,914
But Father is worried,
and I'm scared.

752
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:04,675
So, nothing?

753
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:11,721
Nothing.

754
01:47:25,172 --> 01:47:29,472
Mitya, ride to our country estate

755
01:47:30,010 --> 01:47:33,969
and tell Maxim the gardener
to pay his due to the landowner.

756
01:47:34,247 --> 01:47:37,683
By Friday I'll need here
two hundred pots.

757
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:44,452
Besides, we'll need singers,
strawberries and pineapples.

758
01:47:45,725 --> 01:47:49,286
Don't worry, Count, now that
young Bezukhov is here,

759
01:47:49,496 --> 01:47:52,056
we can get everything
from his hothouses.

760
01:47:52,265 --> 01:47:55,234
Yes, you tell Bezukhov to come
too. I'll include him in the list.

761
01:47:55,402 --> 01:47:58,371
- Is he here with his wife?
- My friend, he is so unhappy.

762
01:47:58,572 --> 01:48:02,064
That young Bezukhov is such
a heavenly, sublime soul.

763
01:48:02,242 --> 01:48:04,733
I'll try to cheer him up.

764
01:48:04,945 --> 01:48:06,242
What happened anyway?

765
01:48:07,247 --> 01:48:11,047
Dolokhov, Maria Ivanovna's son,
has compromised her reputation.

766
01:48:11,318 --> 01:48:15,345
Pierre introduced him to society,
invited to his St. Petersburg home...

767
01:48:15,555 --> 01:48:19,685
Now she came to Moscow and
this dare-devil followed her.

768
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:23,229
They say Pierre
is absolutely heart-broken.

769
01:48:23,396 --> 01:48:25,887
Tell him to come
to the club anyway.

770
01:48:26,099 --> 01:48:30,126
He will forget about everything.
We'll have quite a party!

771
01:48:42,649 --> 01:48:45,049
What's the matter with you?
Don't you hear it?

772
01:48:45,418 --> 01:48:47,386
To the health of our Emperor!

773
01:49:16,850 --> 01:49:19,216
I hadn't recognized you.

774
01:49:23,557 --> 01:49:26,458
Wouldn't you like to renew
old acquaintances?

775
01:49:27,327 --> 01:49:29,761
Forget him. He's a fool.

776
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:34,893
To the health of the hero
of our last campaign,

777
01:49:35,335 --> 01:49:38,463
His Highness Pyotr Ivanovich
Bagration!

778
01:49:48,815 --> 01:49:55,152
Crowned with laurels and with glory
For your famous, heroic deeds,

779
01:49:56,923 --> 01:49:59,949
Russia's pride that's great in story,

780
01:50:00,727 --> 01:50:03,525
Fate has brought you in our midst!

781
01:50:04,564 --> 01:50:10,901
After battle find your peace
In your fellow citizens' circle.

782
01:50:12,939 --> 01:50:15,464
We have heard many a time

783
01:50:16,176 --> 01:50:18,974
Of your feats, gallant and bold.

784
01:50:20,313 --> 01:50:26,741
It's a pleasure as sublime
For all Moscow you to behold.

785
01:50:28,421 --> 01:50:34,724
After battle find your peace
In your fellow citizens' circle.

786
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:40,960
And now let's drink to the health
of beautiful women!

787
01:50:42,636 --> 01:50:46,595
You can't see too well
through your glasses.

788
01:50:46,806 --> 01:50:50,298
Your wife's liaison with Dolokhov
is a secret to no one but yourself.

789
01:50:55,081 --> 01:50:57,606
You can't see too well
through your glasses.

790
01:50:57,817 --> 01:51:03,312
Your wife's liaison with Dolokhov
is a secret to no one but yourself.

791
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:14,289
To beautiful women, Petrousha,
and to their lovers.

792
01:51:19,005 --> 01:51:21,701
You can't see too well
through your glasses.

793
01:51:22,175 --> 01:51:26,134
Your wife's liaison with Dolokhov
is a secret to no one but yourself.

794
01:51:36,656 --> 01:51:38,886
Don't you dare take it!

795
01:51:47,333 --> 01:51:48,732
No, I will keep it!

796
01:51:49,736 --> 01:51:51,829
You... You are a scoundrel!

797
01:51:55,742 --> 01:51:57,710
You will give me satisfaction!

798
01:52:08,154 --> 01:52:11,453
Maybe I'd have done the same
thing in Dolokhov's place.

799
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:15,350
It's even certain that I'd have
done the same.

800
01:52:15,662 --> 01:52:18,392
Then why this duel? This murder?

801
01:52:18,665 --> 01:52:22,066
I should go away, run,
hide somewhere!

802
01:52:23,169 --> 01:52:26,366
At this moment, a very solemn one
for you, Count,

803
01:52:26,573 --> 01:52:28,905
I wouldn't be doing my duty
if I didn't speak frankly.

804
01:52:29,342 --> 01:52:32,709
In my opinion, there're not
sufficient grounds for this duel,

805
01:52:32,946 --> 01:52:35,710
the matter's not worth
blood being shed over.

806
01:52:35,915 --> 01:52:38,440
You weren't quite in the right,
Count, you lost your temper.

807
01:52:38,651 --> 01:52:40,380
Yes, that was stupid.

808
01:52:40,553 --> 01:52:42,521
Then please allow me
to convey your regrets,

809
01:52:42,722 --> 01:52:46,522
and I'm convinced our opponents
will accept your apologies.

810
01:52:46,726 --> 01:52:49,889
- Let me negotiate with them.
- There's no point in that.

811
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:55,058
It makes no difference.

812
01:52:55,935 --> 01:52:57,527
Well, are we ready?

813
01:52:58,772 --> 01:53:02,538
- But perhaps we could...
- Absolutely no apologies!

814
01:53:07,714 --> 01:53:12,617
You just tell me which way should
I walk and where should I fire?

815
01:53:13,019 --> 01:53:14,452
What?

816
01:53:20,026 --> 01:53:23,621
Yes, that's the way it's done.
I know, I've just forgotten.

817
01:53:44,417 --> 01:53:47,909
- Shall we begin?
- I suppose so.

818
01:53:52,091 --> 01:53:56,118
Since there can be no
reconciliation, we may begin.

819
01:53:56,496 --> 01:53:58,691
When I count three,
start advancing towards each other.

820
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:04,026
One, two...

821
01:54:07,407 --> 01:54:08,601
Three!

822
01:55:11,738 --> 01:55:14,707
No, no! It's not over!

823
01:55:43,403 --> 01:55:49,706
Get back to the barrier!

824
01:56:44,998 --> 01:56:46,295
Cover yourself!

825
01:57:00,913 --> 01:57:04,110
I missed! I missed...

826
01:57:09,922 --> 01:57:12,516
It's so stupid, stupid...

827
01:57:18,564 --> 01:57:21,294
Death. Death. Lies!

828
01:57:24,504 --> 01:57:28,702
So stupid.
Death and lies...

829
01:57:58,004 --> 01:58:00,700
Well?
How are you?

830
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:07,145
I'm all right. But I've killed her.
I've killed her...

831
01:58:08,481 --> 01:58:11,678
She won't get through this.

832
01:58:12,652 --> 01:58:14,279
Who?

833
01:58:15,555 --> 01:58:17,113
My mother.

834
01:58:19,425 --> 01:58:21,154
My mother.

835
01:58:23,663 --> 01:58:31,297
My angel, my adorable angel.
My mother.

836
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:38,199
Rostov was greatly surprised
to learn that Dolokhov,

837
01:58:38,478 --> 01:58:41,106
that brawler and duellist,

838
01:58:41,714 --> 01:58:46,276
lived in Moscow with his old
mother and hunchbacked sister

839
01:58:46,919 --> 01:58:50,355
and was a most
loving son and brother.

840
01:58:53,426 --> 01:58:55,155
Now what's all this?

841
01:58:56,395 --> 01:58:58,556
What have you done,
I'm asking you?

842
01:58:59,398 --> 01:59:01,127
Me? Why? I...

843
01:59:01,734 --> 01:59:05,295
You've decided to be a hero!
What's the meaning of this duel?

844
01:59:05,505 --> 01:59:08,406
What were you trying to prove?

845
01:59:10,009 --> 01:59:12,910
So, you won't answer?
Then I'm going to tell you.

846
01:59:13,579 --> 01:59:15,308
You believe everything
anybody says.

847
01:59:15,481 --> 01:59:19,110
You were told that Dolokhov
was my lover, and you believed it.

848
01:59:23,256 --> 01:59:26,885
What did you prove by doing this?
What could you prove with this duel?

849
01:59:27,093 --> 01:59:29,288
That you are a fool?
But everyone already knew that.

850
01:59:29,562 --> 01:59:34,465
Now all this'll end up in my being
the laughing stock of Moscow.

851
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:37,193
And everyone
will be able to say

852
01:59:37,403 --> 01:59:40,201
that you had drunk so much
that you challenged a man

853
01:59:40,406 --> 01:59:42,704
of whom you were jealous
for no reason

854
01:59:42,942 --> 01:59:46,309
and who, in every way,
is a better man than you are.

855
01:59:46,946 --> 01:59:49,744
What ever made you think
that he was my lover?

856
01:59:49,916 --> 01:59:52,510
Because I've enjoyed his company?

857
01:59:52,718 --> 01:59:55,687
If you hadn't been so dull
I might have enjoyed yours more.

858
01:59:55,888 --> 01:59:58,448
Will you stop speaking? Please.

859
01:59:58,724 --> 02:00:00,885
Why should I stop speaking?

860
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:03,458
I'm going to say outright
that there isn't another woman

861
02:00:03,663 --> 02:00:07,224
who married to such a husband
wouldn't have taken several lovers.

862
02:00:08,501 --> 02:00:10,469
And I've never had any.

863
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:14,367
I think we had better separate.

864
02:00:14,574 --> 02:00:18,305
Separate? Only on the condition
that you give me a fortune.

865
02:00:18,578 --> 02:00:21,604
Separate! Don't you think
you can frighten me!

866
02:00:23,649 --> 02:00:26,140
I'm going to kill you!

867
02:00:31,557 --> 02:00:33,115
Get out!

868
02:00:55,414 --> 02:00:56,904
Tikhon!

869
02:00:59,585 --> 02:01:02,315
Go upstairs to Maria Bogdanovna
and just say to her:

870
02:01:02,488 --> 02:01:04,888
"The Prince has sent me
to ask how she is?"

871
02:01:05,258 --> 02:01:07,283
Then come back and tell me
what she says.

872
02:01:12,732 --> 02:01:15,701
You can tell His Highness that
labor has started.

873
02:01:30,016 --> 02:01:31,779
According to a popular belief,

874
02:01:31,984 --> 02:01:35,715
the fewer people know about
the suffering of a woman in labor

875
02:01:36,422 --> 02:01:38,617
the less is her suffering.

876
02:01:39,425 --> 02:01:42,326
Everyone pretended
to be unaware of it.

877
02:01:42,495 --> 02:01:44,463
Nobody spoke about it,

878
02:01:44,797 --> 02:01:48,699
but everyone in the house wore
a common stamp of worry,

879
02:01:49,001 --> 02:01:53,597
of soft-heartedness
and of knowing that something

880
02:01:54,774 --> 02:01:58,904
momentous and incomprehensible
was happening at that time.

881
02:02:28,574 --> 02:02:32,476
If God is merciful,
no doctor would be needed.

882
02:02:41,921 --> 02:02:43,821
Princess, someone is coming.

883
02:02:44,023 --> 02:02:47,982
Up the driveway, with lanterns
lighted. Must be the doctor.

884
02:02:48,728 --> 02:02:51,697
Thank God!

885
02:02:52,264 --> 02:02:56,792
I'll go out to meet him.
He doesn't speak Russian.

886
02:03:05,077 --> 02:03:07,204
- Is the Princess well?
- Very well.

887
02:03:07,813 --> 02:03:11,909
No, it can't be!
It would be so incredible!

888
02:03:33,105 --> 02:03:35,403
There is a kind fate!
Masha, my dear!

889
02:04:38,170 --> 02:04:40,297
Oh, darling...

890
02:04:42,808 --> 02:04:44,776
God is merciful.

891
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:53,614
She was not surprised
at seeing him there.

892
02:04:53,919 --> 02:04:56,888
She didn't understand
that he had returned.

893
02:04:57,323 --> 02:05:01,225
His coming had nothing to do
with her agony,

894
02:05:01,927 --> 02:05:03,895
nor with its relief.

895
02:05:58,918 --> 02:06:00,283
No, you're not allowed in.

896
02:06:24,810 --> 02:06:27,301
Why have they taken
a baby in there?

897
02:06:27,813 --> 02:06:32,978
Why a baby?
Has a baby been born?

898
02:07:05,484 --> 02:07:08,612
I loved you all.
I did no harm to anyone.

899
02:07:09,088 --> 02:07:14,116
And now what have you done
to me? What have you done?

900
02:07:21,634 --> 02:07:25,035
Oh, what have you done to me?
And why?

901
02:08:49,421 --> 02:08:52,788
I can't begin to tell you what
I've been through since then.

902
02:08:53,559 --> 02:08:56,687
Yes, we have all changed
a great deal.

903
02:08:57,730 --> 02:09:02,133
- What are your plans?
- My plans? What can I say?

904
02:09:02,401 --> 02:09:04,369
But why aren't you serving
in the army?

905
02:09:04,803 --> 02:09:07,966
After Austerlitz?
No, thank you very much.

906
02:09:08,407 --> 02:09:10,705
If Bonaparte were here,
near Smolensk,

907
02:09:10,943 --> 02:09:13,707
I wouldn't serve in our army
even then.

908
02:09:15,013 --> 02:09:20,610
- Did you hear about the duel?
- You had to go through that too.

909
02:09:20,819 --> 02:09:24,778
The one thing I thank God for
is he wasn't killed.

910
02:09:24,957 --> 02:09:28,893
Why? Killing a mad dog
is a good thing.

911
02:09:31,096 --> 02:09:37,296
It's evil to kill a man.
It's wrong.

912
02:09:37,736 --> 02:09:39,704
But why is it wrong?

913
02:09:40,172 --> 02:09:43,141
It's not up to men to judge
what is right and what is wrong.

914
02:09:43,475 --> 02:09:46,273
Men will always be wrong,
and never so wrong

915
02:09:46,478 --> 02:09:49,106
as when they decide
what's right and wrong.

916
02:09:49,314 --> 02:09:52,681
Anything that does harm to
another man is wrong.

917
02:09:52,885 --> 02:09:55,615
How can you be sure what will
do harm to another man?

918
02:09:55,821 --> 02:09:58,790
Personally, I know of only two
real evils in life:

919
02:09:58,957 --> 02:10:01,187
Remorse and sickness.

920
02:10:01,493 --> 02:10:04,053
And happiness is the absence
of those two evils.

921
02:10:04,997 --> 02:10:07,591
To live for one's self in such a way
as to avoid these two evils

922
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:09,597
is my whole philosophy now.

923
02:10:09,802 --> 02:10:12,202
But how can anyone live for
himself alone?

924
02:10:12,738 --> 02:10:15,070
No, no, I couldn't live like that.

925
02:10:16,008 --> 02:10:18,909
I'm feeling
deep in my heart

926
02:10:19,745 --> 02:10:26,150
that I'm part
of this vast, harmonious whole.

927
02:10:27,319 --> 02:10:30,948
I feel that not only
I cannot disappear,

928
02:10:31,156 --> 02:10:32,953
as nothing disappears in this world,

929
02:10:33,158 --> 02:10:35,524
but I have been
and will be forever.

930
02:10:35,727 --> 02:10:41,131
This is Herder's philosophy. But
it's not going to convince me.

931
02:10:43,235 --> 02:10:47,535
Life and death
are the only convincing things.

932
02:10:49,942 --> 02:10:53,241
I'm only convinced when I've seen
someone who's dear to me,

933
02:10:54,580 --> 02:10:56,548
who's close to me,

934
02:10:57,316 --> 02:11:00,513
toward whom I behaved wrongly
and still hoped to make it right,

935
02:11:03,488 --> 02:11:08,687
all of a sudden suffering terrible
pain and breathing her last.

936
02:11:11,163 --> 02:11:12,596
What on earth for?

937
02:11:15,334 --> 02:11:16,892
There must be some answer!

938
02:11:18,937 --> 02:11:21,303
Of course...

939
02:11:21,473 --> 02:11:24,442
I mean it's not argument
that convinces me,

940
02:11:24,943 --> 02:11:27,468
it's setting out in life with
someone you love

941
02:11:27,646 --> 02:11:30,046
and suddenly that
someone disappears...

942
02:11:33,318 --> 02:11:37,345
into nothingness.

943
02:11:38,657 --> 02:11:41,888
You stop before that abyss
and have a look down there.

944
02:11:44,730 --> 02:11:46,527
Just as I have done.

945
02:11:51,103 --> 02:11:54,402
Of course. Isn't that exactly
what I've been saying?

946
02:11:55,474 --> 02:11:58,375
We must live. We must love.

947
02:11:59,177 --> 02:12:02,908
We must believe that we're not only
living now on this lump of earth,

948
02:12:03,181 --> 02:12:07,083
but that we have lived and shall
live forever, in everything.

949
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:24,426
Your Highness, isn't it good?

950
02:12:25,804 --> 02:12:28,967
- What?
- Isn't it good, Your Highness?

951
02:12:30,175 --> 02:12:31,767
What is he talking about?

952
02:12:33,478 --> 02:12:35,378
Yes, the spring, I suppose.

953
02:12:39,818 --> 02:12:43,310
It's true, everything
is green already. So soon.

954
02:12:45,157 --> 02:12:48,354
The birch, the bird-cherry...

955
02:12:48,794 --> 02:12:54,755
And the alder is opening up. Only
the oak shows no signs of life.

956
02:12:57,002 --> 02:12:58,731
Yes, there's the oak.

957
02:13:17,923 --> 02:13:19,515
Spring...

958
02:13:20,726 --> 02:13:22,455
Love...

959
02:13:23,261 --> 02:13:24,990
Happiness...

960
02:13:27,099 --> 02:13:33,800
Haven't you grown weary of this
same stupid, meaningless delusion?

961
02:13:36,808 --> 02:13:40,710
It's always the same,
and it's always a lie.

962
02:13:42,180 --> 02:13:46,913
There is no spring,
no sun, and no happiness.

963
02:13:49,087 --> 02:13:54,616
I don't believe in your hopes
and in your illusions.

964
02:13:59,498 --> 02:14:03,400
Yes, the oak is right,
a thousand times right.

965
02:14:04,636 --> 02:14:09,266
Let the others, the young,
to be taken in by this delusion.

966
02:14:10,842 --> 02:14:15,870
We who know life know
that it is finished.

967
02:14:18,016 --> 02:14:20,211
Yet we must live out our lives,

968
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:27,552
doing no harm, and not worrying
or desiring anything.

969
02:15:03,395 --> 02:15:06,125
His obligations as trustee
of the family's Ryazan estate

970
02:15:06,331 --> 02:15:08,299
compelled Prince Andrei
to call upon

971
02:15:08,500 --> 02:15:12,061
the local Marshal of Nobility,
Count Rostov.

972
02:15:32,424 --> 02:15:34,824
- Just once more!
- But when are you coming to bed?

973
02:15:35,026 --> 02:15:38,427
I can't sleep anyway.
What can I do?

974
02:15:57,482 --> 02:16:01,441
Oh, isn't it lovely?
Now let's go to bed!

975
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:03,319
You go. I can't.

976
02:16:05,323 --> 02:16:07,518
Sonya, how can you sleep?

977
02:16:08,260 --> 02:16:11,627
Just look how lovely it is.

978
02:16:11,796 --> 02:16:13,286
Oh, wake up, Sonya!

979
02:16:13,498 --> 02:16:16,467
There's never been
such a beautiful night.

980
02:16:16,935 --> 02:16:18,903
Will you look at that moonlight?

981
02:16:19,104 --> 02:16:20,901
Oh, it's marvelous!

982
02:16:21,106 --> 02:16:23,904
Come and look, please, my dear.

983
02:16:26,478 --> 02:16:27,877
You see?

984
02:16:31,416 --> 02:16:35,819
It makes me want to sit down
on my heels, like this,

985
02:16:37,322 --> 02:16:39,347
put my arms around my knees...

986
02:16:39,558 --> 02:16:42,527
and hug them tight,
as tight as I can,

987
02:16:44,596 --> 02:16:47,963
and then I'd fly up. Like this!

988
02:17:53,732 --> 02:17:56,701
Yes, it was here, in this forest,
that I saw that oak,

989
02:17:57,502 --> 02:17:59,697
with which we agreed.

990
02:18:00,739 --> 02:18:02,468
But where is it?

991
02:18:05,477 --> 02:18:07,809
Yes, it's the same oak!

992
02:18:25,997 --> 02:18:29,296
I loved you all.
I've done no harm to anyone.

993
02:18:29,801 --> 02:18:32,133
And now what have you done to me?

994
02:18:42,914 --> 02:18:45,747
We must live. We must love.

995
02:18:46,651 --> 02:18:50,280
We must believe that we're not only
living now on this lump of earth,

996
02:18:50,722 --> 02:18:54,453
but that we have lived and shall
live forever, in everything.

997
02:19:01,933 --> 02:19:05,460
No, life is not over at thirty-one.

998
02:19:07,105 --> 02:19:10,074
It's not enough for me to know
what I have in me.

999
02:19:10,642 --> 02:19:12,667
Everyone else must know it too:

1000
02:19:13,011 --> 02:19:16,913
Pierre and that little girl
who wanted to fly away.

1001
02:19:17,415 --> 02:19:19,542
Everyone must know me

1002
02:19:19,918 --> 02:19:22,512
so that my life won't be spent
for myself alone.

1003
02:19:22,721 --> 02:19:24,689
My life must be reflected in theirs,

1004
02:19:24,923 --> 02:19:27,892
and all the others must live
my life with me!

1005
02:19:45,543 --> 02:19:54,542
End of Film One
