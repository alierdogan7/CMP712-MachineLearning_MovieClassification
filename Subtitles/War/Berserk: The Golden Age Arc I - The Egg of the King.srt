1
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,852
Pull!

2
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,698
Hurry Up!

3
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,260
To your posts!

4
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,478
All right! Make your way forward!

5
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,773
The man who brings me
their General's head will get a reward!

6
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,162
See you later!

7
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,208
Wait a minute!

8
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,670
It's Bazuso!

9
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,801
The one who killed 30 men?!

10
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,974
And a bear?!

11
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,975
How about it?

12
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:41,142
If you want your head smashed in,
step right up!

13
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,516
What are you doing?

14
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,189
Defeat him and you'll be famous!

15
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,151
Go on!

16
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:48,687
You go!

17
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,406
He's too tough for me.

18
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,160
Goddamn bunch of mercenaries!

19
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,864
Listen to that coward!

20
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,866
His balls have shrunk up inside of him!

21
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,331
Men! Have no mercy!

22
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,918
Gouge out their eyes!
Pull out their innards!

23
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,500
We'll feed them to the pigs!

24
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,356
Who's that?

25
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,854
He's still a kid!

26
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,355
Who's he with?

27
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,561
What a sword!

28
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,898
Look at him act tough.
He'll get his head split open!

29
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,447
He is fighting the Bazuso!

30
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,907
Give me ten.

31
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,033
What?!

32
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,497
The price for this scrap of iron here.

33
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:48,498
We mercenaries, aren't knights.
I can't feed myself with glory.

34
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,124
Bet against Bazuso?!

35
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,709
Brave words!

36
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:57,886
Fine! Bring him down and I'll
give you seven pieces of silver.

37
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,513
Cheap bastard.

38
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,762
Oh, well...

39
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:22,160
You'll be sorry, boy.
You're going to lose your head...

40
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,907
for seven pieces of silver!

41
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,080
H-He's fast!

42
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,339
Hey! Bazuso's getting pushed back!

43
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,054
What's going on? No one's done
that to Bazuso before!

44
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,093
Who is he?!

45
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,767
Damn it!

46
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,807
I'm going to put
a stop to you now!

47
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,384
W-Wait!

48
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,928
You are definitely the better man!

49
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,429
I, Bazuso am...!

50
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,107
Bazuso's been...!

51
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,469
Now! They've lost their confidence!

52
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,838
Charge!

53
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:10,473
That guy's really something.
I wonder who he's with.

54
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,351
Don't get carried away.
We just got here too late.

55
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:16,775
Blame it on that stupid general.
It's not our fault.

56
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,319
Hey, Griffith! I wonder
who's stronger, you or him?

57
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,036
Don't ask stupid questions.
Of course, it's Griffith.

58
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,178
All right! Next!

59
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,307
Two months' salary...

60
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,185
and your reward for this battle.

61
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:59,354
Are you sure you won't reconsider?

62
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:06,198
It's triple the salary, and maybe
you'll even be a squire one day.

63
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:11,946
That's an impossible dream for
most mercenaries, you know.

64
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,039
Dream? You can't eat dreams.

65
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,042
W-Wait!

66
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:30,138
It's guaranteed money and status.
What's your problem with that?

67
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,016
I hate being restrained.

68
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,226
Next!

69
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,417
Bandits, huh?

70
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,681
All right! Go!

71
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,939
Shit!

72
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,858
Just you wait!

73
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,719
<i>He's... really strong!</i>

74
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,304
He's killing us.

75
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:02,688
Now what?

76
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:06,310
Corkus is shitting himself.

77
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,854
The guy's really tough.

78
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:12,111
Him taking down Bazuso was no fluke.

79
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,692
What do we do?

80
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,818
Told you so.

81
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:16,911
Casca...

82
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,283
Go help him.

83
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,995
Why? It was Corkus's idea!

84
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,170
Yeah, Okay.

85
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,132
Go get him!

86
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,002
Why? You started this!
You get him!

87
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,345
Oh, no!

88
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,176
No!

89
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,344
Oh, shit!

90
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,064
Pull back!

91
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,391
Thanks!

92
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,200
What's with that length?

93
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,549
A sin?

94
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,633
You bastard!

95
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,564
He's even pushing Casca back.

96
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,445
That's impossible.

97
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,618
<i>I'm gonna die!</i>

98
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,915
Griffith!

99
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,134
Careful! He's strong!

100
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:57,758
Griffith?

101
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,214
That's it for you!

102
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,050
Get him, Griffith!

103
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,523
Could you sheathe your sword?

104
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,737
No?

105
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,786
He's fast!

106
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,461
<i>Shit!</i>

107
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,308
Amazing! In just one blow!

108
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,067
Griffith...

109
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,603
<i>On your feet!</i>

110
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,522
<i>You think you'll stay alive that way?</i>

111
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,697
<i>Look! I did it!</i>

112
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,241
<i>Look!</i>

113
00:15:56,497 --> 00:16:00,127
<i>You've been sold out!</i>

114
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,508
<i>Gambino! Is that true?!</i>

115
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,371
<i>After him!</i>

116
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,917
<i>He took in that kid!</i>

117
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,919
<i>And this is how he pays him back?!</i>

118
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,933
<i>Gambino!</i>

119
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,735
<i>You're alive!</i>

120
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,368
Hey!

121
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,582
What's going on?

122
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,341
Where am I? Why are you here?

123
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:18,522
Griffith should've just killed you
and left you!

124
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,693
Why, you...

125
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,193
That's for my horse!

126
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,284
Shit...

127
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,290
That bitch!

128
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:47,801
All right, this one!

129
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,308
Be grateful to Casca.

130
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,606
She lay with you for two days

131
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,059
to keep you warm after you lost all that blood.

132
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,940
What?!

133
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,522
On Griffith's orders.

134
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:12,068
He says it's a woman's job to keep men warm.

135
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,906
Damn it, Judeau!

136
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,958
Sorry!

137
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,084
So you're awake.

138
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,668
Griffith! Good morning.

139
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,516
I'm Griffith. What's your name?

140
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:47,603
Guts.

141
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,826
This is an amazing sword.

142
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,115
I could never wield it.

143
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,621
Will you come with me?

144
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,462
Hi, Griffith!

145
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,973
Griffith!

146
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,347
Hey!

147
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,935
You're really popular.

148
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,728
Hey...

149
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,824
So good!

150
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:39,080
So that bastard's up and around?

151
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,659
Griffith?

152
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,621
I'm getting a strange feeling...
Where am I?

153
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,456
You're with the Band of the Hawk.

154
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,875
Heard of us?

155
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:56,431
The last mercenaries you want
to face on the battlefield.

156
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,097
They gave us a lot of trouble
in the last battle.

157
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,057
So it was these guys?

158
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,225
Yes. We're the Band of the Hawk.

159
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,162
Such a nice view!

160
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,246
Why?

161
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,375
Why did you deliberately miss my heart?

162
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,206
You could have done it easily.

163
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:39,132
It's because I want you, Guts.

164
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,646
What, you swing that way?

165
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:52,404
I saw your duel with Bazuso.
It was very admirable.

166
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,656
But it was a close call.

167
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,365
If his battle axe wasn't cracked...

168
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,866
he would have split your head open.

169
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,747
Probably.

170
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,006
You're honest.

171
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:18,429
You fight like you're trying to see
how much you can get away with.

172
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:24,469
To me, it looked like you were
intentionally exposing yourself to danger...

173
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,267
but at the same time,
you're also struggling to survive.

174
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,099
That's just how it felt.

175
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,313
I like you.

176
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,607
I want you, Guts.

177
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:47,784
And if I say no?

178
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,498
You don't want to?

179
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:54,378
Yeah, I refuse!
Talking like you know everything...

180
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:59,963
stabbing someone...

181
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,506
and then acting like you're their friend...

182
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,019
I'll settle it with this.
If I win, I get to stab you...

183
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,643
in the chest just like you did to me.

184
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,107
And if I win?

185
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,483
You can make me your soldier or
your piece of ass... do whatever you want.

186
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,115
All right.

187
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,910
I don't mind doing things by force.

188
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:32,419
Griffith!

189
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,497
Stay back, Casca.

190
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,331
But...

191
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,794
I always get what I want.

192
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:44,098
That's what I don't like about you.
You don't have any respect!

193
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:00,481
Shit!

194
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:01,403
Hey, look!

195
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,530
The guy just won't quit!

196
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,283
Griffith <i>says</i> stay out of it.

197
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,666
We can do this another day.
You're still weak.

198
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,167
Fuck you!

199
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,337
- Griffith!
- That's not fair!

200
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:31,270
You'll do anything to win.
I'm liking you more and more.

201
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,560
But you can't move your sword now.

202
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,026
What do you want to do?
You can quit now if you like.

203
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,070
You sure like to run your mouth.

204
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,566
But in a real fight,
you have to use your mouth...

205
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,782
like this!

206
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,872
Griffith!

207
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,423
How does your own blood taste?

208
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:07,928
I bet no one has ever hit that
pretty face of yours before.

209
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,231
I hate to show you up in front of your men,

210
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,183
but this ends now!

211
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,576
- Yes! He did it!
- Amazing!

212
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,453
That was effective...

213
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,532
But it's over now.

214
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,283
You give up...

215
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:37,628
or I'll dislocate your shoulder.

216
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,417
It's your choice.

217
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,840
You piece of shit!

218
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,934
Oh man! He kicked his ass!

219
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,780
And now you're mine.

220
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,283
<i>He's never said that to anyone!</i>

221
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,411
<i>Griffith has never said
that to anyone before!</i>

222
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,553
So now I'm in the Band of the Hawk.

223
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,145
Guts, I'm going to have you fight...

224
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,433
For something dear to my heart.

225
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,778
I will get my own kingdom.

226
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:54,614
Guts, I'll be the one to decide
the place where you'll die.

227
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,023
Hold your ranks!

228
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:29,073
Show those Chuder dogs
what Midlanders are made of!

229
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,039
Don't let them escape!
Kill anything that moves!

230
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:08,271
Their Black Ram Iron Lance Heavy Cavalry
is inflicting heavy damage!

231
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,695
At this rate even our headquarters
here may be in danger!

232
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,331
Isn't there anyone...

233
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,957
who can stop those black devils of Chuder?

234
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:26,838
Forward!

235
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,958
The Black Ram Iron Lance Heavy Cavalry

236
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,836
will take the head of the King of Midland!

237
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,971
Fool!

238
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,436
One man against all of us?

239
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,311
Fine then!
I'll ride right over him!

240
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:05,082
- He killed General Gien!
- With one blow, by himself!

241
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,344
He's alone! Surround him!

242
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,837
But...

243
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,215
What's that?!

244
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,301
From behind!

245
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,720
That's...

246
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,346
the Band of the Hawk!

247
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:42,452
The grim reapers of the battlefield!

248
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,081
Why are they fighting for Midland?!

249
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,380
Chuder is retreating.

250
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,177
Impossible!

251
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,048
One band of mercenaries can't possibly
turn the tide of the whole battle!

252
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,430
Is this "Band of the Hawk" strong?

253
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:05,850
Yes. They were well worth the price.

254
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,355
Do not put too much stock
into one surprise attack.

255
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,655
But they defeated the Black Rams,
when we could not.

256
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:21,071
And the brilliance of their attack,
and how they anticipated the enemy...

257
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:25,537
Who leads them?

258
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,743
He is called Griffith, Sire.

259
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,746
"Griffith"?

260
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:53,936
Guts!

261
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,280
That was amazing!

262
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,946
A bit too cool, maybe, riding out there alone.

263
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:07,662
Sorry. I shouldn't have charged them alone.

264
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:12,087
As if he ever felt sorry!

265
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:15,215
Yeah! That's not like the Captain.

266
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,805
Anyway, we won. Let's celebrate.

267
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:29,226
Yes! Let's have a toast!

268
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,151
Then follow me!

269
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,941
Why Corkus?

270
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:39,031
It was Guts who did a great deed!

271
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,239
Guts!

272
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:44,528
I need to talk to you.
Will you give me a minute?

273
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:46,326
"Captain Guts, Sir"?

274
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,172
What was that about?

275
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,837
What?

276
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:58,925
Don't play dumb!

277
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:02,005
You were supposed to be a diversion.

278
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:06,425
Instead you charged them head-on by yourself.

279
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,519
It worked out well this time,

280
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:14,354
but you could have put
the entire Band of the Hawk in danger.

281
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,773
Remember your place.

282
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,694
Sorry. I'll keep that in mind.

283
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:24,534
It's always the same!

284
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,570
Just talk.

285
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:29,536
You haven't changed in three years.

286
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,744
You're satisfied just waving
a sword around on the battlefield.

287
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:38,875
You're a mad dog who never thinks
about your comrades one bit!

288
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,301
You're wrong. I'm not like I was!

289
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,935
I think about my comrades...

290
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,263
That's enough.

291
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,605
Griffith!

292
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,692
I'll speak to Guts.

293
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,199
You're too easy on him, Griffith.

294
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,832
You two really don't get along, do you?

295
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:20,257
It's not me.
She's always on my case.

296
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:26,301
It's been like this for three years.
Give it a rest.

297
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,177
Three years...

298
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,394
Yes, since you and I fought.

299
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,263
I enjoyed that.

300
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,100
I like that kind of fight.

301
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:48,073
Let's go. You're the man of the hour tonight.

302
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,370
Griffith...

303
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,537
I'm sorry... about today's battle.

304
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:03,292
Guts, fight for my sake.

305
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:06,796
Since you're mine.

306
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,613
Have you heard about Lord Griffith?

307
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,991
Yes, it is most disturbing.

308
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:33,664
It is true we have not been defeated
since the Band of the Hawk joined us, but...

309
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:38,001
They are mercenaries,
led by a man who can be bought.

310
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:42,248
Without war, they are nothing but bandits.

311
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,710
To elevate riff-raff like that...

312
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:48,053
Yes. The low-born are low-born.

313
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:51,348
Nothing good can come about from
treating them <i>as</i> something more.

314
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:56,930
But without them, Chuder might
have destroyed us by now.

315
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:02,397
I can understand why His Majesty
would have gone to all this trouble...

316
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,729
But Still...

317
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,400
Yes, but still.
Raising a commoner to nobility...

318
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,993
It is an eccentric choice by His Majesty.

319
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:17,912
They say the Band of the Hawk led
our armies in the last battle.

320
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:22,204
Then what of Count Julius and
his White Dragon Knights?

321
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,039
He's being relieved.

322
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:29,261
The ransom was quite high
when Chuder took him prisoner...

323
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,230
The enemy Count is dead.

324
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:51,529
Gut's Raiders are still inside
mopping up the resistance.

325
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,778
That's unusual for it to be taking so long.

326
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,530
I didn't think this castle
would be this hard to take.

327
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,254
Why didn't you report sooner?!

328
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:08,584
Someone said there was
treasure deep inside the castle.

329
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:12,633
And then we started hearing screams...

330
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,426
No one came out.

331
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,508
Enough! I'll go look.

332
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,926
Let go, Gaston!

333
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:21,017
We should go ask General Griffith
for reinforcements.

334
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,315
Do that and I'll kill you!

335
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,017
Captain!

336
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,444
Don't follow me!

337
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,940
What happened to these corpses?

338
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,183
What...

339
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,518
is that?!

340
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,264
Nosferatu Zodd?

341
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:50,979
Yeah, it looks like he's on
the enemy's side in this battle.

342
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:54,281
Zodd, you mean
the legendary swordsman?

343
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:58,444
They say you could fill a whole country
with the heads he's taken.

344
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:02,368
He's not feared just
because he's powerful.

345
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:07,498
The tales of his achievements
in battle go back 200 years.

346
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,381
200 years?!

347
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:15,677
That's why they call him
Nosferatu Zodd.

348
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,304
<i>He's strong! Too strong!</i>

349
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:26,222
You have done well, boy,
to stand against me for this long.

350
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,439
<i>I see...</i>

351
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:34,271
<i>So the swords alone are
evenly matched, huh?</i>

352
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,761
I see..

353
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,806
You were aiming for my sword.

354
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:12,310
You're the first man to drive
their sword this deeply into me!

355
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,528
I am pleased.

356
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,907
To stand against an enemy like you...

357
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:28,875
is probably why I have survived
for these 300 years!

358
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,086
Impossible!

359
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,680
A monster like this exists?!

360
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,815
Fight me!

361
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,230
Do not disappoint me!

362
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:08,912
Is that all you've got?

363
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,497
No, I should say you have
done well for a human.

364
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,047
That's Zodd?!

365
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,680
Stay focused! Second volley!

366
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,887
Fire!

367
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:39,024
I won't have this!

368
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:42,691
No one shall defile this fight,
no matter who you are!

369
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:48,747
It's no use! Get out of here!

370
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,209
Casca, have everyone withdraw!

371
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,544
Griffith! Where is...?

372
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:05,888
Guts!

373
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,596
Idiot! What are you doing here?!

374
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,936
Save it for when we get away
from that monster.

375
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,056
Fight me!

376
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,810
Until you are shredded into pieces!

377
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:19,568
Oh, shit!

378
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,237
Griffith!

379
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,732
Can you move?

380
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,072
If I don't, we're dead.

381
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,570
Take the left.

382
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:29,696
Let's go!

383
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,386
Guts! We'll make a run for it!

384
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:50,391
Griffith!

385
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:58,646
To think I would meet two men
on the same day who can wound me...

386
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:03,272
and then have to lose them both.

387
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,575
No!

388
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,869
He is my...

389
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:12,997
my...

390
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:19,125
Farewell, human!

391
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,334
This is...?!

392
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:26,799
The Egg of the King?!

393
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:31,466
What is the Crimson Behelit doing here?

394
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:41,355
I see! So it's that kind of trick!

395
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:52,324
Boy, I will give you a warning.

396
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,789
No, a prophecy.

397
00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:00,917
If you are a true friend to this man...

398
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,673
take heed.

399
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,006
When his ambition dies within him...

400
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,672
death will come to you!

401
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:14,347
A death you cannot escape!

402
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:29,574
What was that?!

403
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:30,949
A demon?

404
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:33,778
What was that?

405
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,284
Besides that...

406
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:43,630
A "true friend"?
I'm going to die?

407
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,170
I don't get it.
Just what's going on?

408
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,301
Griffith! Speak to me!

409
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,344
Are you all right'?!

410
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:55,599
Keep away!

411
00:43:56,843 --> 00:44:00,564
It's your fault this happened to Griffith!

412
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,392
It's your fault!

413
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,541
<i>You haven't changed in three years.</i>

414
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:31,760
<i>You're a mad dog!</i>

415
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:37,972
<i>It's your fault this happened to Griffith!</i>

416
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:40,057
<i>It's your fault!</i>

417
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,767
Shit!

418
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,853
What the hell is she talking about?!
That bitch!

419
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:49,945
Don't be so upset.

420
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,569
You're hurt worse than I am.

421
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,912
You're tough.

422
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,037
Nosferatu Zodd?

423
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:08,628
A monster like that in this world?
That's serious.

424
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,799
If you look at it another way,
it might prove...

425
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:16,677
the existence of something
that we can't know.

426
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,972
Like God.

427
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:23,267
Wouldn't it be more like the Devil?

428
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,644
Isn't that the same thing?

429
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,778
While we're at it,
that thing around your neck...

430
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:39,078
When that monster saw it,
he took off.

431
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:40,905
What is it?

432
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:46,878
A Behelit. An old fortune teller
gave it to me once.

433
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:54,382
She said it's the destiny of one
who holds it to acquire the world

434
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:57,051
in exchange for
his ﬂesh and blood.

435
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,009
The world, huh?

436
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:27,623
That thing gives me the creeps!
Don't scare me like that.

437
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,167
It's neat, huh?

438
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,723
That part of you never changes, does it?

439
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:46,062
I'll never change.

440
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:54,941
So why?

441
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,408
I'm just a soldier, a subordinate at the very least.

442
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,743
Why did you save me?

443
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,785
No reason at all.

444
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:14,049
Do I need a reason every time
I put myself in harm's way for you?

445
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,015
It's just...

446
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,265
Have your wounds healed?

447
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,356
Sire!

448
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,113
Hey, Guts!

449
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:48,958
You are in the king's presence!
You're being disrespectful.

450
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,389
Never mind. Raise your heads.

451
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:10,473
Count Griffith, your Band of
the Hawk is doing magnificent work.

452
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,185
Thank you.

453
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:16,110
Sire, should you speak thusly
to one so new with us?

454
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,943
And why not?

455
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:23,535
Yes, there are some who do not think well

456
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:26,245
of these men of common birth.

457
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:30,829
But dignity and status do not win battles.

458
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:35,797
I have great hopes for you,
unfettered by tradition as you all are.

459
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:41,219
I am grateful for your kind words.

460
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:45,924
Who is that lady?

461
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,767
My daughter Charlotte.

462
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:57,690
She says she does not like warriors,
and rarely comes outside.

463
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,191
Charlotte...

464
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:06,569
She is my only child.
Perhaps I've spoilt her.

465
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,863
You must forgive me Count Griffith.

466
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,250
Come along, Charlotte.

467
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,233
Are you all right?

468
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:46,738
Excuse me.

469
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:48,744
Please be careful.

470
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:50,905
Um...

471
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:58,004
How dare you touch the princess!

472
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:02,799
Why, you old...

473
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,306
I apologize, Your Lordship General Julius.

474
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,435
As long as you understand, it's all right.

475
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:16,731
Princess, your father awaits.

476
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,355
Coming, Uncle!

477
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:42,377
Why are we wasting time with
these nobles and their sports?

478
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,546
It's stupid.

479
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:52,138
It's all part of the job.
And it beats being on a battlefield.

480
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,271
No arrows, no heads split open...

481
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:02,401
Using this thing suits me better.

482
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,480
There he goes...
bloodthirsty madman.

483
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:07,030
Not again, Corkus!

484
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,236
Shut up!

485
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:12,779
Standing guard at the hunt has
always been reserved for knights.

486
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,325
It's an honor!

487
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:20,204
This is what we've all fought for
in the mud of the battlefield!

488
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,293
And you're calling it stupid?!

489
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:24,381
Corkus!

490
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:29,971
If you want to wave around your sword,
go do it alone, you madman!

491
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:40,564
To each his own, I guess.

492
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,891
Well then, please excuse me.

493
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:00,910
You don't like to hunt?

494
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:12,881
Why do gentlemen enjoy bloodshed?

495
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,840
In war, and in hunting...

496
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:21,271
Oh, my!

497
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:31,402
Your Highness, like this...

498
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:52,802
General...

499
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,097
We'll wait for our chance.

500
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:56,807
It went that way!

501
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:57,766
After it!

502
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,993
Please! Stop!

503
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:35,629
It's all right now.

504
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:40,012
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

505
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,815
Are you hurt?

506
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:56,943
What's wrong?

507
00:53:57,276 --> 00:54:00,325
I was so afraid!

508
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,994
My heart's pounding!

509
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,372
I've never...

510
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,841
You seem to be calming down.

511
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:17,756
Let's get back.
Everyone will be worried.

512
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,011
Griffith!

513
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:22,850
Griffith!

514
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:26,059
Guts...

515
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:34,988
Griffith!

516
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,075
Shit!

517
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,364
Griffith!

518
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,366
Princess!

519
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:50,792
What happened?
Where did the arrow come from?!

520
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:51,880
Ouch!

521
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:54,417
Griffith! Griffith!

522
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:58,550
Don't cry, Casca.

523
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,760
- Griffith!
- Griffith!

524
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:05,678
The arrow. Are you all right?

525
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,555
Don't touch it.

526
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,062
It's probably poisoned.

527
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,810
All the more reason...

528
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:14,478
No.

529
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:16,989
This shielded me.

530
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,826
The Egg of the King...

531
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,361
What?!

532
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:23,863
Incredible!

533
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,123
That's devil's luck!

534
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,457
I can't believe it!

535
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,702
That's not "luck."

536
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:31,454
It's a miracle!

537
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,792
I'll go search those bushes with some men.

538
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:44,430
Take off your armor.
We have to make sure you're not hurt.

539
00:55:58,605 --> 00:55:59,948
This poison...

540
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,072
will cost someone...

541
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,248
You're kidding!

542
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:14,125
What?!

543
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,797
Look at you!

544
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:28,143
How can you hope to lead my White Dragon Knights

545
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:29,637
fighting like that?!

546
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:30,804
I've had enough!

547
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,522
F-Father! I can continue.

548
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:40,989
Let's see to that wound, Master Adonis.

549
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:45,487
Your father, in his youth, was the product

550
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,487
of very severe training.

551
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:50,282
Do not hold this against him.

552
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:57,794
Kill? Who?

553
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:01,510
The second in line to the throne.

554
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:04,638
The General of the White Dragons, Count Julius.

555
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:11,182
The poison on the arrow meant for me,

556
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:16,275
is one this royal house <i>has</i> used
for generations, for assassinations.

557
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,569
This will be dirty work.

558
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:22,444
One cannot fail.

559
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,951
Or be seen.

560
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:38,335
That is why I am asking you.
Will you do it?

561
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,881
This isn't like you.

562
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:46,263
Just give me an order like you always do.

563
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:49,300
Begging your pardon, Highness,

564
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,893
perhaps you are being a little
too rough on the young master?

565
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,011
Enough, Hassan!

566
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,018
Adonis cannot stay a child forever.

567
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:59,936
When he succeeds me, he must be ready.

568
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:00,982
But...

569
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:02,321
Enough! Withdraw!

570
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:30,683
Not only did I fail, but he's now
a hero for saving the Princess!

571
00:58:36,972 --> 00:58:38,224
The wind?

572
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,274
Hey, Hassan!

573
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:47,115
An intruder?!

574
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:15,139
I know...you!

575
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:20,517
You're... Griffith's...!

576
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:33,471
Hey!

577
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,418
I heard something.

578
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:08,582
Someone's there!

579
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,088
An intruder!

580
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,426
Look!

581
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:13,841
Master Adonis!

582
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,759
To arms!

583
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:17,633
Intruder!

584
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:22,429
<i>Damn it!</i>

585
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:24,189
He should still be close!

586
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:25,728
Be careful!

587
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:38,905
Master Adonis, too! How brutal!

588
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:49,089
Find him! Don't let him escape alive!

589
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:04,103
There he is! He's on the west wall!
Cut him off there!

590
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:20,036
Fire!

591
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:45,353
I bet Griffith is eating better stuff
than this at the Princess's banquet.

592
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:52,437
Yeah, but with that bunch
he won't be able to relax.

593
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:54,983
So what?

594
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,906
He'll get to eat fine food,

595
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:59,868
and get lucky with some perfumed noble lady.

596
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:01,658
What's a little stress?

597
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:06,746
Get lucky with a noble lady at
Princess Charlotte's banquet?

598
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,285
I doubt that.

599
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:10,333
Where's Guts?

600
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:12,798
I haven't seen him all day.

601
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:17,340
He's probably off practicing again.
That bloodthirsty madman.

602
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:18,969
Another, Pippin...

603
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:24,010
He was supposed to train with
my unit today.

604
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:26,386
But he didn't show up.
Without a word.

605
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:34,402
There he is!

606
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,237
Guts!

607
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:43,787
Where have you been all day?

608
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:49,750
Where's Griffith?

609
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:52,750
Princess Charlotte invited him...

610
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:54,998
to her banquet.

611
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:58,635
He should be at Promrose Hall...

612
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:03,423
<i>I</i> see.

613
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:07,052
Hey! I'm not done talking to you!

614
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:08,099
Guts!

615
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,266
An arrow wound?

616
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:49,223
What a nice breeze!

617
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:53,811
I've never grown accustomed to
events like this.

618
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,858
I'm a bit tired.

619
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:11,291
Please, Princess Charlotte...

620
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:13,743
Oh, my!

621
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,505
Thank you.

622
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:28,883
Wait.

623
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:33,472
You're going in like that?
Don't embarrass Griffith.

624
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:36,983
Wait until they're finished talking.

625
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,018
Give me this.

626
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,447
Hey...

627
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:59,960
I remember you asked me why men are so fond...

628
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,671
of bloodshed.

629
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,215
Yes.

630
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:09,721
It's true it might simply be
a barbaric side to their nature.

631
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:15,102
But that allows men to preserve
something that is dear to their hearts.

632
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:17,895
It's a sword that cuts both ways.

633
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:22,820
"Dear to their hearts"?
Like a lover?

634
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:25,444
I meant...something like honor?

635
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,785
Both are important.

636
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:33,415
A true knight fights and dies
for both love and honor.

637
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:41,582
But a man should encounter
one more thing

638
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:43,750
that is dear to him.

639
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,127
One more thing?

640
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:53,935
A dream he must realize for
himself and himself alone.

641
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,436
A dream?

642
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:06,031
No matter who you are,
it's a dream that sets you on fire.

643
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:11,028
It's a dream that sustains you,
oppresses you, keeps you alive...

644
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:13,905
and then kills you.

645
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:20,337
Even after the dream abandons you,
it still smoulders in your heart.

646
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:25,879
At least once,
a man should have a vision of that life...

647
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:30,631
as a martyr to the god named Dream.

648
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:37,722
To simply live a life because
one was born into it...

649
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:39,392
I can't accept that.

650
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:51,777
I'm sorry. This must be such
a boring topic for a lady.

651
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,782
Not at all!

652
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:55,948
You're...

653
01:07:56,698 --> 01:08:00,373
a very mysterious gentleman.

654
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,955
You're nobler than any nobleman.

655
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:08,377
But when you showed me how
to play the leaf whistle,

656
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:10,720
you were like a child playing in the fields.

657
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:14,386
And now you're like a philosopher.

658
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,396
I'm sure...

659
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:31,858
this charm is what attracted
your friends to you.

660
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:37,910
They are precious comrades who
have faced death with me many times.

661
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:41,876
But they are not friends.

662
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:46,544
A friend is someone who does not
cling to another's dream.

663
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,834
He decides his own,

664
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:51,086
and he will stand against anyone

665
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:53,463
who dares to trample
on it with his body and soul.

666
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:57,467
Even if that person is me.

667
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:04,104
A friend to me, is an equal.

668
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:27,876
Lord Griffith, so what is this dream of yours?

669
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:29,791
Princess!

670
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,216
What is it?

671
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:40,343
I-It's terrible!

672
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,430
Your Uncle Count Julius, has died!

673
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,098
What did you say?

674
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:46,566
It was an assassination!

675
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,855
Someone crept into his home
and murdered him!

676
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,945
His son Master Adonis, too!

677
01:09:52,063 --> 01:09:55,658
The castle's in an uproar!
The banquet has been cancelled.

678
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:59,371
His Majesty orders you to return home at once!

679
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:03,583
Your escort is coming.
Please prepare to depart!

680
01:10:04,784 --> 01:10:08,379
Come on. There'll be war if
this is Chuder's handiwork.

681
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,039
Guts?

682
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:55,464
There's no time to think.

683
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,180
How to fight, how to kill...

684
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:01,390
That's all there is.

685
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,981
I wanted to be his sword!

686
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:14,191
It's just a castle that's a little bit bigger.
So what?

687
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:18,157
Just do what Griffith says,
and it will be ours.

688
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:34,507
Risk your life!
That's the only way you'll survive!

689
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,877
If we survive, we win!

690
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:45,761
I just wanted to see what Griffith
and the Band of the Hawk were up to.

691
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:48,354
Who they brought with them

692
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:51,646
and what else they were after.
