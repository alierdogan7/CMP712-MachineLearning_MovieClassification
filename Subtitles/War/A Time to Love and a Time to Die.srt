1
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,110
(Car horn)

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,992
(Brakes screech)

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,713
Ernst!

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,435
I thought it was you!

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,393
Don't you recognise your friend anymore?

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,356
Binding. Oskar Binding, of course!

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,357
Who else! Where have you come from?

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,993
- Russia.
- Russia!

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,918
I'd say that calls for a celebration.
Come along to my place.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,476
I have a first rate cognac or
anything else you want. Anything at all.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,034
Come. For old time's sake.

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,712
- I could use a drink.
- Ah!

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,353
You've worked your way up in the world.
District Leader Binding. Not bad!

14
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,232
Just goes to show you anything can happen.

15
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,794
Me, who couldn't even get
a passing grade in History.

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,309
Political leader
to keep the Mayor straight!

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,078
Come on.

18
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,551
Cosy, isn't it.

19
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,877
And all mine, a milkman's son!

20
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,028
Who would have thought that I,
Oskar Binding, would be...

21
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,912
an art collector!

22
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,598
What would you like to drink?

23
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,713
Brandy? Cointreau? Vodka? Gin?

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,196
Kimmel? Wine? What?

25
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,197
Anything, it doesn't matter.

26
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,630
What's bothering you, Ernst?
Anything I can do?

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,440
If there is, tell me, you know
I've got quite a position here now.

28
00:01:59,441 --> 00:02:00,201
(Distant explosion)

29
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:02,913
Maybe you can help me, Oskar.
My parents are missing.

30
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,951
They were bombed out, I can't locate them.

31
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,197
How terrible. I'll see what I can find out.
What else?

32
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,719
Nothing else.

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,798
It's as good as done. Come on,
make yourself comfortable.

34
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,831
Take off your coat.

35
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,239
- Frau Kleinert. Brandy glasses.
- Yes, Herr Binding, brandy glasses.

36
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,749
- Where are you living now?
- At the old barracks.

37
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,917
A furlough in barracks?
You must come and stay here with me.

38
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,077
- Thanks, but I can't.
- Of course you can, look.

39
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,710
Here you would have your own room and bath.

40
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,435
How long's it been since you had real
soap and all the hot water you want?

41
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,278
Seems like I've never had them.

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,119
Well you have them now.

43
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,997
(Sergeant) Hertz.
(Hertz) Here.

44
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,158
- Hobermeier.
- Here.

45
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,518
Well, how do you like it?

46
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,480
- Immerman.
- Here.

47
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:47,799
It'll do!

48
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,279
- Shroeder.
- Here.

49
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,720
- Here, let me take that.
- Thanks.

50
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:52,799
- Graeber.
- Here.

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,240
Say! You've acquitted yourself well!

52
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,474
- Heller.
- Missing.

53
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:56,435
- Rainer.
- Missing.

54
00:02:56,436 --> 00:02:58,076
They hand those out to make us look good.

55
00:02:58,188 --> 00:02:59,708
That how you got that little ornament?

56
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:00,629
- Holzmann.
- Missing.

57
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,720
- Steinbrenner.
- Here.

58
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:02,521
- Russia?
- Africa.

59
00:03:02,522 --> 00:03:03,202
- Riess.
- Here.

60
00:03:03,203 --> 00:03:04,796
So you were there too?
Isn't that something.

61
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:04,997
Hahn.

62
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:06,598
Missing.
Second company reporting, sir.

63
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,301
- Herr Binding?
- Yes.

64
00:03:07,302 --> 00:03:08,720
31 present, 87 killed, wounded or missing.

65
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,121
- The brandy glasses.
- Thank you.

66
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:12,477
- Lieutenants Kleiner and Haesser, dead.
- Right, Sergeant.

67
00:03:12,478 --> 00:03:15,158
Combined First and Second Platoons,
Fourth Company reporting, sir.

68
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:17,889
29 present, 42 killed, wounded
or missing. Lieutenant Vogel's missing.

69
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,118
And if you want a woman, Ernst,
or several women if that's your taste,

70
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:22,191
There's a chance some of the men
were cut off and will get through later.

71
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:22,892
This is the place for it.

72
00:03:22,893 --> 00:03:23,453
Let's hope so.

73
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,096
They're around here like flies,
begging for favours.

74
00:03:25,097 --> 00:03:27,235
Get your men into some kind
of quarters. Won't be here for long.

75
00:03:27,236 --> 00:03:28,197
Offering everything they have.

76
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:29,758
Sergeant Muecke, dismiss the battalion.

77
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,999
Even if they no longer have it.

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,920
You should have seen
the one in here yesterday!

79
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,081
(Shouts) Battalion dismissed!

80
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:36,112
A beautiful creature
from the old aristocracy,

81
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,471
with long red hair and a superb figure.

82
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,238
Pleading with me on her knees

83
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,636
to get her husband
out of the concentration camp.

84
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,240
But it isn't all fun.

85
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:48,721
You've no idea how lonesome it gets
for a man in my position.

86
00:03:48,722 --> 00:03:49,977
What's the name of this village?

87
00:03:50,003 --> 00:03:51,738
- If you stay here...
- I'm sorry, I can't.

88
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:52,259
I don't know.

89
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,576
It had a name
when we were first through here.

90
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:55,089
You see, everywhere I've been
for news of my parents.

91
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,014
It even had people... and houses.

92
00:03:56,015 --> 00:03:57,079
I've given the barracks as my address.

93
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,900
I understand, but remember,
you always have a home here with me.

94
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:01,057
We've been through here so often, it's
a wonder they don't make us pay rent.

95
00:04:01,058 --> 00:04:02,626
And if you need anything,
one has connections you know.

96
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:04,615
The first time we were coming through
we were making 1 00 miles a day.

97
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:05,316
It was the great advance.

98
00:04:05,317 --> 00:04:06,185
That's very good of you, Oskar.

99
00:04:06,186 --> 00:04:08,118
And now it's the great retreat, huh?
Is that what you mean, Graeber?

100
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:10,061
Not at all. If old school mates
don't stick together, who will?

101
00:04:10,062 --> 00:04:11,228
What I mean is...
now we're here again.

102
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:12,797
Can you really get someone out
of a concentration camp?

103
00:04:12,798 --> 00:04:14,758
In retreat.
That's what you're saying, isn't it?

104
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,969
Don't put words in his mouth, Steinbrenner.

105
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,174
It's easier for me to get them in than out.

106
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:18,575
But naturally I didn't tell that
to the red head.

107
00:04:18,576 --> 00:04:20,116
The only one talking about retreat
around here is you.

108
00:04:20,117 --> 00:04:21,013
You remember Professor Pohlmann?

109
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:22,470
All the rest of us know
that everything is perfect.

110
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,871
Of course.
I intend to drop by school to see him.

111
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:25,440
We're gonna annihilate
the enemy this year for certain.

112
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:26,981
Don't. Remember, he's the reason
I had to quit school.

113
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:28,522
We annihilate them every year,
sometimes twice a year.

114
00:04:28,523 --> 00:04:30,539
He couldn't get it through his head that
my work with the Hitler Youth.

115
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,724
Immerman, one of these days you're
going to talk yourself straight into hell!

116
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:34,069
Was more important than
his lousy examinations.

117
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,910
It might be a pleasant change.

118
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:37,095
Well, when I became Party Adviser to
the School Board, I returned the favour.

119
00:04:37,096 --> 00:04:38,916
Sergeant Muecke said you're to quarter
in the cellar over there.

120
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:39,589
I had him put in a camp!

121
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,438
Naturally that meant that he was
kicked out of his teaching post.

122
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,699
Thanks for getting Steinbrenner
off my back.

123
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,016
He had me kicked out,
so I had him kicked out.

124
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,865
Watch yourself, the Gestapo didn't
put that dog here for nothing.

125
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:46,398
That's justice, eh!

126
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,359
If he turns you in as an alarmist
you can kiss your furlough goodbye.

127
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,116
And he's still in the camp?

128
00:04:49,117 --> 00:04:50,993
No, we only left him there for
a few months to teach him a lesson.

129
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:52,730
What furlough? I've been waiting for it
for seven months now.

130
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:53,907
You know my soft heart.
The last I heard,

131
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:54,740
Or is it seven years?

132
00:04:54,741 --> 00:04:56,982
He was living in the back of
the bombed out Jahnplatz Art Museum.

133
00:04:56,983 --> 00:04:58,823
I felt so sorry for him
I let him stay there.

134
00:04:58,824 --> 00:04:59,384
(Howling wind)

135
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:00,505
Binding, what are you doing?

136
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:02,038
Sacrificing my favourite bath salts.

137
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,399
- Hey, Immerman.
- Yes? What now?

138
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,509
Lilac. The perfect finish
to a gentleman's bath.

139
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,160
Finish is right. Holy jumping Jupiter!

140
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:09,281
Looks like spring is coming.

141
00:05:09,282 --> 00:05:11,471
That's the one sure way to tell.
The sun digs them up.

142
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:12,992
To your parents... and our friendship.

143
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:15,038
I'll put a couple of men on it
first thing in the morning,

144
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,239
What's the matter, Hirschland?

145
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,880
In a few days we ought to know something.

146
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:19,438
Still not used to the boulevards of Russia?

147
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,039
- How about another drink?
- All right.

148
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,240
And a bottle to take with you.

149
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:24,881
Three weeks he's been with us
and everything still surprises him.

150
00:05:24,882 --> 00:05:25,162
(Sighs)

151
00:05:25,163 --> 00:05:26,828
Ha! I know.

152
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,157
Spring at home means
leaves on the trees, flowers.

153
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,273
That comes much later here. First,
you've got to get a good taste of mud.

154
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,320
Leave him alone, Sauer.

155
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:37,973
There was a message for you, I tore it off.

156
00:05:37,974 --> 00:05:39,414
This isn't to be used to make dates.

157
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:40,295
It's a German uniform.

158
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:40,776
Dig him out!

159
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:41,983
Here.

160
00:05:41,984 --> 00:05:44,224
"Ernst, if you want to see me,
I'll be home after 7 '."

161
00:05:44,225 --> 00:05:45,385
And careful with the shovels.

162
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,466
- Oh, he won't feel it anymore.
- He's one of ours!

163
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:48,078
Elisabeth!

164
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,560
He won't feel that anymore either.

165
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:51,357
Thanks.

166
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,473
Must be one of the January dead.

167
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,409
Remember that big snow storm?
Couldn't find anyone afterwards.

168
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,850
Oh, it's you! I was all set for a battle
with the crocodile!

169
00:05:59,851 --> 00:06:02,691
Nah! The January ones melted out
a long time ago, the wolves ate them.

170
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:04,852
Ha ha! She's gone to a meeting
with other crocodiles.

171
00:06:04,853 --> 00:06:06,573
I bet you this is one of the November dead.

172
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:06,894
Come in.

173
00:06:06,895 --> 00:06:08,715
- January.
- November.

174
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,309
I'm sorry about the way I acted last night.

175
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,000
- Oh, don't...
- There is no excuse for it.

176
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,480
I have such a terrible temper.
I try to control it, but...

177
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,512
(Explosions in distance)

178
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,840
He's from our regiment.

179
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,639
Why didn't you just kick me?

180
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,320
Get Captain Rahe.

181
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:27,441
I would have, if I hadn't of thought
you'd enjoy it.

182
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:28,922
Careful there, it's a German officer!

183
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,920
Even that he won't feel anymore.

184
00:06:32,921 --> 00:06:34,551
You're early.

185
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,480
I at least hoped to comb my hair
or change my blouse before you came.

186
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,399
It's Reike!

187
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,914
- I could go and come back later?
- No, no. Please.

188
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,957
Sit down, won't you.
I'll be just a minute.

189
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,230
Did you learn anything about
your parents today?

190
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,960
No. But I had one good break.
Bumped into an old friend of mine.

191
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,799
He looks like he's crying.

192
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,677
Party District Leader, no less.

193
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,479
- He promised to do...
- The District Leader is your friend?

194
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,839
His eyeballs are frozen.

195
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,078
He was a class mate of mine.

196
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:03,920
They're thawing now.

197
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:06,229
The milkman Binding's boy.

198
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,148
He offered to do anything he could
to help me find my parents.

199
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,520
What was I supposed to say? No?

200
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:12,601
It's Lieutenant Reike, sir.

201
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:15,555
Not only that, Elisabeth.
He kept asking what else he can do.

202
00:07:15,556 --> 00:07:17,476
Bury him in the church courtyard.
Make a cross.

203
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:18,917
I thought if I handle him right I...

204
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:19,278
Yes, sir.

205
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:21,517
I might be able to find out something
about your father.

206
00:07:21,518 --> 00:07:22,470
Send his personal belongings home.

207
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:23,591
That should be easy for him.

208
00:07:23,592 --> 00:07:24,664
All he has to do is ask the Gestapo.

209
00:07:24,665 --> 00:07:26,261
Four captured guerrillas
have been sent here to be shot.

210
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:26,990
Or maybe he's one of them.

211
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:27,831
I'll need volunteers.

212
00:07:27,832 --> 00:07:30,337
All I know is he's the person I've seen
since coming home who's willing to help.

213
00:07:30,338 --> 00:07:30,938
Very well, sir.

214
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:31,939
Volunteers! Step forward.

215
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,780
Murderers are never murderers
24 hours a day.

216
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:35,396
(Wind whistles)

217
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:35,800
(Coughs)

218
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:40,590
Some adore their mothers,
some cry when their dogs are dying.

219
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,200
But it's enough when they are murderers
for one minute a day.

220
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:44,513
I volunteer, sir.

221
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:46,914
At least for the people who are
in their hands at the time.

222
00:07:46,915 --> 00:07:49,475
Choose the others. You're in command,
we have no officers left.

223
00:07:49,476 --> 00:07:51,236
What happened to you, Ernst?
Are you blind?

224
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,238
Or don't you want to see?

225
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,400
All right, the rest
of the firing squad detail.

226
00:07:54,401 --> 00:07:57,521
It's nearly as dangerous to talk to you
as it is to walk through a minefield.

227
00:07:57,522 --> 00:07:59,393
Immerman! Sauer! Hirschland!
Weiber! Graeber!

228
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:03,747
Now, this came from Binding.
Shall we call it loot from the enemy?

229
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:05,668
(Explosions
and rumble of collapsing buildings)

230
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:06,989
Or shall I pour it down the sink?

231
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,871
We'll drink it.

232
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,231
I must have a corkscrew some place,
but where?

233
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,590
I'll show you how we do it in the Army.

234
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,200
That's one way to avoid a hangover I guess!

235
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:41,681
Make the grave bigger, Grandpa,
she'd like to be comfortable.

236
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:43,197
You should laugh more often.

237
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,880
Or does it only happen when
a bottle of brandy is smashed?

238
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,360
I thought I was smelling brandy,
but it isn't, it's lilac.

239
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,281
I think they loathe us.

240
00:08:49,282 --> 00:08:51,284
We're soldiers. Why should we be
called on to shoot civilians?

241
00:08:51,285 --> 00:08:52,748
But it can't be,
it's too early in the year.

242
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,748
Let's go for a walk, Elisabeth.

243
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:55,744
Oh, you can always say no.
Get shot yourself instead.

244
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:56,529
It must be spring somewhere.

245
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,930
No one knows for sure
that they are guerrillas...

246
00:08:57,931 --> 00:08:59,639
Not our worry. We didn't sentence it,
so we're not to blame.

247
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,292
I know just the place.
We can get a drink and sit a while.

248
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:02,385
That's the excuse for everything we do.

249
00:09:02,386 --> 00:09:03,198
Or have you been out all day?

250
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:05,439
No matter how rotten it is
we can always blame it on...

251
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,360
I've been sitting behind a machine
in a sticky room with 50 other women.

252
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:08,681
Line up!

253
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,310
We make Army overcoats.

254
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,035
The Labour Service asked me what
I could do, I said, "I play the piano."

255
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,151
So they put you to work as a seamstress?

256
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,510
Yes, they must have heard me play!

257
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,831
Look alive!
There will be no more grumbling.

258
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,679
You are given orders and you will obey.

259
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,280
Without question.
Without complaint.

260
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:29,992
- Closed.
- Oh.

261
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,520
I used to come here with my father.

262
00:09:31,521 --> 00:09:32,361
(Explosions continue)

263
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:35,470
He'd drink beer and talk with his friends
while I went wading in the river.

264
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,840
I remember the boats going by,
and the music playing...

265
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,269
Oh, please, Ernst.
No "I remember when" talk.

266
00:09:40,304 --> 00:09:40,624
(Sniffs)

267
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,585
(In Russian) Oh Lord and master
of my life, keep from me the spirit of...

268
00:09:43,586 --> 00:09:44,873
This is where the lilacs must be.

269
00:09:44,874 --> 00:09:45,234
Smell it?

270
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:46,555
I'm gonna shoot over their heads.

271
00:09:46,556 --> 00:09:49,196
Must be an early blooming variety.
That warm spell we had last...

272
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:50,517
You won't be doing them a favour.

273
00:09:50,518 --> 00:09:52,107
We've all tried that.
Just had to do it again.

274
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:53,828
I'm the only variety that's blooming early.

275
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:55,890
It isn't every day a district leader
drowns you in his bath salts.

276
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:57,131
It's like executing them twice.

277
00:09:57,132 --> 00:09:59,172
(Praying tearfully)
Oh, sovereign Lord, let me see

278
00:09:59,173 --> 00:10:01,053
I think I'll volunteer
to be shot to the moon.

279
00:10:01,054 --> 00:10:02,294
My own sins and transgressions.

280
00:10:02,296 --> 00:10:03,376
Let's go down to the river.

281
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:05,316
And not judge my brother...

282
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,470
Leave the cow for me, will you?

283
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,640
(Russian woman) Murderers!

284
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:12,990
The first star.

285
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,440
God will punish you and all Germans!

286
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:15,161
What did you wish?

287
00:10:15,162 --> 00:10:16,918
That it wouldn't be an enemy bomber.

288
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,679
What have you done?

289
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,239
- lt isn't.
- No, it's a star.

290
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,950
I pray to God that He will grant
that your children will meet my sons.

291
00:10:23,983 --> 00:10:25,103
My curse be upon all of you.

292
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:25,864
Is something wrong?

293
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:28,223
They will shoot them down
just as you are shooting us down.

294
00:10:28,224 --> 00:10:28,560
No, nothing.

295
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,241
I just thought...

296
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:30,162
Ask her what she wants.

297
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,717
She's cursing you and all Germans
for standing on Russia's soil.

298
00:10:32,718 --> 00:10:33,318
Oh, it's crazy!

299
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:34,399
I'm just not myself at all.

300
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,108
For every Russian that you kill,
they will kill ten Germans.

301
00:10:36,109 --> 00:10:37,593
Well, whoever you are,
I'm glad you're here with me.

302
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:39,834
For every home you destroy,
we will destroy ten cities.

303
00:10:39,835 --> 00:10:40,315
And smiling.

304
00:10:40,316 --> 00:10:42,956
- For each insignificant life...
- Shut up! Shut up, you lunatic!

305
00:10:42,957 --> 00:10:43,397
Don't stop.

306
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:45,200
It's the nicest thing I've seen in years.

307
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:47,159
Kill us while you still can!

308
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,400
Ernst, look. The tree!

309
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:51,472
Kill us!
But soon we will annihilate you!

310
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,079
Ready!

311
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,637
Up!

312
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,160
Hirschland! Hold that rifle steady.

313
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:57,721
It's blooming!

314
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,559
Long before it should be.
None of the others are.

315
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:01,920
Take aim!

316
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:03,477
That boat house took a bomb.

317
00:11:03,478 --> 00:11:05,518
The heat of the fire
must have forced it to bloom.

318
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:05,719
Fire!

319
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,640
Half the tree's gone but it blossoms
as if nothing had happened!

320
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:09,321
(Shouting ceases)

321
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,911
If only we could do
what this tree is doing, Elisabeth.

322
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,395
Just trust life and go on.

323
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,750
If only we could do that.

324
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,271
- I tried to have courage but suddenly...
- You have courage enough.

325
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,231
I don't.

326
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,112
I only pretend to have.

327
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,231
That's what we all do.

328
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,836
Hey! Vodka!

329
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,116
Sergeant Muecke rounded it up!

330
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:37,557
All right, so she's been unfaithful.

331
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:38,958
It's a reward for the firing squad.

332
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,119
What do you expect,
you've been away for three years.

333
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,872
And so what? She's not made
out of soap, she won't wear out.

334
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,276
I've made up my mind.
She'll have to give me a divorce.

335
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,755
Why should she be so stupid?

336
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,634
As long as she's the wife of a soldier
she gets 200 marks a month.

337
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,812
And a very nice death benefit when
your ash can gets punctured.

338
00:11:57,813 --> 00:11:59,813
Nasick, why don't you do
the whole town a favour,

339
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:02,854
buy a fireman's hat and go home so
the Fire Department can go back to work!

340
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,535
It's first class vodka, don't you want it?

341
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:06,317
I told you to get out of here,
we're trying to play cards.

342
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:07,718
Get away from him! Leave him alone.

343
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:08,468
- Sauer!
- In a minute!

344
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:09,673
Oh, getting dressed to go out already, huh?

345
00:12:09,674 --> 00:12:10,962
Listen, do I tell the Sergeant
you refused...

346
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,643
Tell the Sergeant anything!
Just put them down and get out!

347
00:12:12,644 --> 00:12:13,313
- Same girl?
- Yep.

348
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:15,582
Gentlemen, let's drink a toast to the man
who is smart enough to take my advice.

349
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,067
- Sauer, you're holding up the game.
- Quit yelling.

350
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:17,588
No you don't.

351
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:19,069
All right, idiots.
Do what you want.

352
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,350
Oh, thank you, Doctor Boettcher.

353
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:21,377
Will you do me a favour?

354
00:12:21,378 --> 00:12:23,710
That won't stop the rest of us
from drinking our part.

355
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,520
I want to go somewhere special tonight.

356
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:25,841
Berning?

357
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:28,722
Do any of those wonderful places
where you spent your time still exist?

358
00:12:28,723 --> 00:12:29,523
(Indistinct chatter)

359
00:12:29,524 --> 00:12:31,804
There is a law. In war time,
luxuries are not permitted.

360
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:32,805
- Wagner?
- No, go away.

361
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:35,366
Of course, the officers
who are supposed to enforce these laws.

362
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:38,367
Drink it yourself and stop bothering us.
Maybach, see what's on the radio.

363
00:12:38,368 --> 00:12:39,608
Sometimes need a little luxury.

364
00:12:39,609 --> 00:12:40,609
So there is such a place.

365
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,798
I was once its best customer!

366
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,680
(Crackly music)

367
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:44,270
The Germania in Lindenplatz.

368
00:12:44,271 --> 00:12:46,111
Oh, but you see?
You cannot get in with this.

369
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:47,472
Turn it off!
Turn that thing off!

370
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:48,481
It's patched, it's not even pressed.

371
00:12:48,482 --> 00:12:50,302
They're like old women,
they'll be at each other's throats next.

372
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,039
You have to at least look like
a rich private to be admitted.

373
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,550
It's always that way after an execution.

374
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:54,184
Turn that back on!

375
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:56,425
I'll loan you my uniform, it's brand new
and it was made by a general's tailor.

376
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:57,998
You do and you'll be wearing it
on your head!

377
00:12:58,267 --> 00:12:59,515
It won't fit. Besides, I'm in a hurry.

378
00:12:59,516 --> 00:13:01,644
There's an official news broadcast.
Don't you know it's an order to listen?

379
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:03,157
Now, nothing starts at the Germania
before 9 o'clock.

380
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:03,718
I'm not in the mood.

381
00:13:03,719 --> 00:13:04,895
We will have plenty of time to fix you up.

382
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:06,548
And don't waste your breath
informing on me, Steinbrenner.

383
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:08,425
Feldmann here used to be a tailor.
Feldmann! Get out of your sack!

384
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:09,186
Times have changed.

385
00:13:09,187 --> 00:13:11,987
Our primitive Casanova needs
some help - he is going to the Germania!

386
00:13:11,988 --> 00:13:14,988
I'm a crack machine gunner, the sort
of talent that's needed round here...

387
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:15,629
more than yours.

388
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,350
I open for twenty.

389
00:13:16,351 --> 00:13:17,599
Ah! Ha ha ha! Yes!

390
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,677
I pass.

391
00:13:18,678 --> 00:13:20,518
That's the way
it was supposed to look on me.

392
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:21,479
(Gunfire and explosions)

393
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,320
Of course, you do lack
my air of distinction.

394
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:23,881
I said twenty.

395
00:13:23,882 --> 00:13:25,697
Drum fire. If it keeps building
we can expect company.

396
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:27,574
But I should think in the dark
you'll be able to get away with it.

397
00:13:27,575 --> 00:13:27,975
(Laughter)

398
00:13:27,976 --> 00:13:30,056
Are we artillery observers
or are we playing cards?

399
00:13:30,057 --> 00:13:31,518
Now remember,
the old head waiter's name is Heinz.

400
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,319
I opened for twenty.

401
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,549
The wine you are to order is
Johannisberger Kochsberg '37.

402
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,015
Tomorrow we will be back in the lines.

403
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:37,033
If there's a line left anywhere.

404
00:13:37,034 --> 00:13:37,194
'37.

405
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:38,629
- From the cellars of G.H. von Mumm.
- Von Mumm.

406
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,582
Stop worrying about your furlough.

407
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,283
Not too chilled mind you.

408
00:13:40,284 --> 00:13:42,468
At the rate we're going back, we'll all be
in Germany soon without furloughs.

409
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:44,429
And order it as though you are
accustomed to bathing your feet in it.

410
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,774
Either play or tell stories,
make up your mind.

411
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:47,315
Now, remember my boy,
it's easier to die than to live.

412
00:13:47,316 --> 00:13:48,156
Are you telling me to shut up?

413
00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:49,237
If he isn't, I am. Shut up!

414
00:13:49,238 --> 00:13:50,330
So, you do us all proud tonight.

415
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:51,031
Why don't we all shut up.

416
00:13:51,032 --> 00:13:51,432
Thank you.

417
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:52,793
If you need anything, send for me.

418
00:13:52,794 --> 00:13:55,383
Yes, you tell her tonight is
your last night, for tomorrow you die!

419
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:55,668
(Shouting)

420
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:56,509
What's going on here?

421
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,150
Tell her anything except your right name!

422
00:13:58,151 --> 00:13:59,551
We'll be waiting for a full report.

423
00:13:59,552 --> 00:13:59,872
Nothing.

424
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:02,273
I'm available if you need help!
And if her husband comes...

425
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,074
Argument over cards.

426
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:03,998
(Door slams)

427
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,232
On with the game.

428
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,760
Ha! Good vodka. Wasted.

429
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:10,352
Cut.

430
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,315
I'm not the man I used to be. In France
I could spit in a high, beautiful arc.

431
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,839
Now I spit like a civilian.

432
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,713
I wouldn't care how I spit
if I was a civilian.

433
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,960
- Graeber.
- Yes, Sergeant.

434
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:24,278
(Elisabeth whispers) Ernst!

435
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,159
Report to the captain.

436
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,439
You can't come up. She has visitors.
Old crocodiles.

437
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,279
Your furlough's come through.

438
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,200
Why aren't you dressed?

439
00:14:30,201 --> 00:14:30,521
(Cheers)

440
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:31,442
I had to see you first.

441
00:14:31,443 --> 00:14:34,003
- Hey, finish the hand.
- Save it. I'll be back in three weeks.

442
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,670
Graeber! What is the first thing
you will do at home?

443
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:37,311
What a question!

444
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:39,552
Which? This one's mine.
I can be ready in five minutes.

445
00:14:39,553 --> 00:14:40,753
Get deloused. Take a hot bath.

446
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,640
Sleep in a clean bed.
Forget for three weeks there's a war.

447
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:43,481
This was my mother's.

448
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,162
- That's all?
- Yeah, I got better ideas.

449
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:48,523
I'm not finished making it fit but it will
only take another 30 minutes. All right?

450
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,150
I'll wait.

451
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:51,960
You knew I would.

452
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:53,158
Why aren't you inside?

453
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,835
They're drinking the Sergeant's vodka,
aren't they?

454
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,317
No, they're not.

455
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,590
And what if they were?

456
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,918
Not drinking it won't change anything.
And it won't bring anyone back to life.

457
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,480
Hirschland, don't think because
you stood there disapproving

458
00:15:10,481 --> 00:15:12,753
with your big baby eyes
that you're any better.

459
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,720
It's not that easy.

460
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:15,790
Good evening. Quickly, please.

461
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,200
What are you staring at?

462
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:19,561
Is old Heinz still in charge here?

463
00:15:19,562 --> 00:15:22,477
Yes, of course. Er...
But, er...

464
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,320
Why don't you stop thinking about it?
Drive it out of your mind.

No.

468
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,677
I don't.

469
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,149
And I don't want to talk about it.

470
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,720
I don't want to talk or think about the war
for a long time.

471
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:43,521
Herr Reuter sent me.

472
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,072
That's an elegant new uniform.

00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,629

00:17:10,678 --> 00:17:11,998
If I were you, I'd leave at once.

513
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:13,398
The barracks.
From a man named Reuter.

514
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,570
The whole front's coming alive,
leaves may be cancelled.

515
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:17,211
He's such a gourmet he even has the gout.

516
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:18,102
If you're gone, you're gone.

517
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,063
This is his uniform,
made by a general's tailor.

518
00:17:20,064 --> 00:17:21,224
(Distant explosions continue)

519
00:17:21,225 --> 00:17:24,105
Until I mentioned Reuter's name
that doorman was going to throw us out!

520
00:17:24,106 --> 00:17:26,348
Places like this
aren't supposed to be open anymore.

521
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,120
Suppose you were caught here,
it may be all right for them but...

522
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:32,231
How would they punish me?
Not send me back to the front?

523
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,112
There's nothing to be afraid of.

524
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,878
Not even the prices here?

525
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,468
I've nearly two years' combat pay with me.

526
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,352
And only two weeks to spend it or so.

527
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,040
Two weeks or so?

528
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,752
That soon?

529
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,120
How much?

530
00:17:45,121 --> 00:17:46,121
Two weeks is a long time.

531
00:17:46,122 --> 00:17:48,362
If you have to ask how much
you don't want my services.

532
00:17:48,363 --> 00:17:49,603
Nice and clear crystal glasses.

533
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:51,164
I have real soap left over from France.

534
00:17:51,165 --> 00:17:51,605
The finest.

535
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,878
Easy! Remember we're on...

536
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,831
Don't say it. I've sworn to myself,

537
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,236
the next man who reminds me we're on
the same side loses a piece of throat!

538
00:17:59,360 --> 00:17:59,920
Attention!

539
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:01,161
- Very good.
- Thank you, sir.

540
00:18:01,162 --> 00:18:03,602
To celebrate your homecoming
the Fûhrer himself has decreed.

541
00:18:03,603 --> 00:18:04,223
Something wrong?

542
00:18:04,244 --> 00:18:06,221
If I drink before eating I'm liable
to fall right under the table!

543
00:18:06,222 --> 00:18:08,431
That every man on leave
is to be given a package of food.

544
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:09,692
- On wine?
- On anything. I drink so little.

545
00:18:09,693 --> 00:18:12,795
It is a gift for your families as evidence
that the front line troops are cared for.

546
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:13,156
Nonsense.

547
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:15,837
Here's... Here's to everything
that's been missing from our lives.

548
00:18:15,838 --> 00:18:16,998
And can even bring food home.

549
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:17,839
See you on the floor!

550
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,033
It is your responsibility
to comfort and cheer...

551
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,559
(Aircraft engine roars)

552
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,074
- ls it good, sir?
- It's wonderful.

553
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,480
(Gasps)

554
00:18:24,481 --> 00:18:25,481
Never mind! They're ours!

555
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:28,316
It must be, because I'm thinking things
that I haven't thought for a long time.

556
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:30,837
It is your responsibility to comfort
and cheer your dear ones.

557
00:18:30,838 --> 00:18:31,358
Like dancing.

558
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,190
Divulging of troop movements
or positions is treason.

559
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:35,678
It's the wine, madam. The sun
that ripened it shines out again.

560
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,719
Idle criticism is treason.

561
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,160
It was a great year for wine, 1 937.

562
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:40,212
In short, you are to tell them
nothing of the front.

563
00:18:40,213 --> 00:18:42,213
That's the way to remember
our great years, Otto.

564
00:18:42,214 --> 00:18:42,534
Nothing.

565
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:43,775
By their wines, not their wars.

566
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:44,216
Understood?

567
00:18:44,217 --> 00:18:45,194
Certainly, sir.

568
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:45,680
(Hiccups)

569
00:18:45,681 --> 00:18:47,959
And now, men with furloughs to Cologne,

570
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,040
Oh, sorry! Tell me to stop.

571
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,712
Raise your hands.

572
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:53,368
No, go on! I guess that's
one way of enjoying wine.

573
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:56,169
Cologne is at the present time restricted,
your leaves are cancelled.

574
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,170
I can stop, I know I can.

575
00:18:57,171 --> 00:18:59,518
My whole family is in Cologne.
Has something happened there?

576
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:00,799
If I concentrate on something...

577
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,160
Men with furloughs to Hamburg
and Bremen, raise your hand!

578
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:04,881
Look at that lovely goose liver, Elisabeth.

579
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:07,270
And that lovely silver
which is not just silver anymore,

580
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,659
and the music's not just music.

581
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,660
Check everybody's papers.

582
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:10,021
(Hiccups)

583
00:19:10,022 --> 00:19:11,662
Well, whatever it is, I'm drinking to it.

584
00:19:11,663 --> 00:19:13,943
The rest of you, get yourselves
cleaned up and deloused.

585
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,640
And to Reuter the gourmet.

586
00:19:15,641 --> 00:19:16,521
(Indistinct murmuring)

587
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,557
And G.H. von Mumm for his wine.
And to you.

588
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,713
To us.

589
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,197
To us, but especially to you.

590
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,834
Because your eyes are shining

591
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,997
and you're more beautiful
each time I see you.

592
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,040
Only, right now...
you look like the next time.

596
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,001
Begins to look like home, doesn't it?

597
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,877
I'll be there in time for supper.

598
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,231
Not out of a tin mess kit either -
supper served on real china plates.

599
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,679
(Band plays upbeat music)

600
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,597
The warning alarm, sir.
There was no preliminary alert.

601
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,233
Excuse me.

602
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,389
But please, do not be concerned.
The cellar here is safe.

603
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,873
Drink it down, all of it.
Forget the sirens.

604
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,040
My hiccups have gone.

605
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:25,589
Verden! All out for Verden!

606
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,234
Doesn't this train go
to the main station of the city?

607
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,510
You'll have to walk the rest of the way.

608
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,159
You've got to hurry, sir.

609
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,759
Madam.

610
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,552

00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:38,309
That was his great crime.

686
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,400
- May I have some of that wine, please?
- Of course.

687
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:42,870
(Cry)

688
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,239
- Elisabeth?
- Yes.

689
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,191
Elisabeth...

690
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,231
Why don't we get married?

691
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,229
It's going to rain.

692
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,560
Didn't you hear me?

693
00:25:04,561 --> 00:25:06,710
(Cat miaows)

694
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,714
There's nothing wrong with my hearing.

695
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,277
It's my sense of humour.
I don't have any about certain things.

696
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,436
I wasn't trying to be funny.

697
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,160
As the wife of a soldier you'd be
entitled to 200 marks a month.

698
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:20,239
Your papers.

699
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,992
Plus a nice death benefit.

700
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,714
Why make a present of it to the State?

701
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,273
I see.

702
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,640
Then it's settled?

703
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:30,401
- You lived here? At 18?
- I was born here.

704
00:25:30,402 --> 00:25:31,485
Certainly not.

705
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:33,726
Do you know anything about
my parents? Were they saved?

706
00:25:33,727 --> 00:25:36,287
That's what I like: enthusiasm.
But why not? 200 marks a month.

707
00:25:36,288 --> 00:25:38,248
Who knows?
Maybe they weren't even in the house?

708
00:25:38,365 --> 00:25:40,605
Look on the door over there.
Maybe they left a message?

709
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:41,246
I don't want it!

710
00:25:41,247 --> 00:25:44,110
I guess you don't.
Well, I can't say that I blame you.

711
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,600
What's a lousy 200 marks
if you have to take me with it...

712
00:25:46,601 --> 00:25:48,721
- Don't say that!
- What would you prefer me to say?

713
00:25:48,722 --> 00:25:50,282
- That you understand.
- I understand.

714
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:52,312
Do you? Because you don't have to
offer me anything in order...

715
00:25:52,313 --> 00:25:53,433
I know those signs by heart.

716
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:54,834
That's not why I offered it to you!

717
00:25:54,835 --> 00:25:56,397
Heinrich. Come to Uncle Hellmann,
Thüringenstrasse, 4.

718
00:25:56,398 --> 00:25:57,638
I simply wanted you to have it.

719
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,199
But don't you see, I can't accept it...

720
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,680
Irma dead, Mother.
Are you Heinrich?

721
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:01,841
Don't bother to spell it out!

722
00:26:01,964 --> 00:26:03,684
You just don't want me so...
I'll go back.

723
00:26:03,685 --> 00:26:04,751
Maybe you are Otto?

724
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,639
Otto, we are at the primary school.

725
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:07,960
Ernst.

726
00:26:07,961 --> 00:26:10,474
- For God's sake...
- Go away! Let him alone.

727
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,920
I want you so much I ache.

728
00:26:11,921 --> 00:26:13,558
Anything from them?

729
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,875
No. They didn't know
I was coming home.

730
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,230
There must be a better way than this
to find someone.

731
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,238
Not tonight. Tomorrow you can start
making the rounds.

732
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,909
There ought to be a record of them
somewhere. If they're still alive.

733
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,556
Elisabeth.

734
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,355
Well, goodnight.

735
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,840
Ernst!

736
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:44,958
Boettcher. Herman Boettcher.

737
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,002
- Be...
- Boettcher!

738
00:26:47,003 --> 00:26:48,123
There is no Boettcher! Next!

739
00:26:48,124 --> 00:26:50,644
What do you mean there is
no Boettcher? What am I? A cucumber?

740
00:26:50,645 --> 00:26:50,873
Morning!

741
00:26:50,966 --> 00:26:51,890
Good morning, and start talking.

742
00:26:51,891 --> 00:26:52,031
Next!

743
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,628
I'd like to know what my uniform's
been up to all night.

744
00:26:53,629 --> 00:26:55,533
Graeber. Paul and Marie. Worked
in the tax office. 18 Hakenstrasse.

745
00:26:55,534 --> 00:26:57,634
How about lending it to me a while
longer? I want to take it to a wedding.

746
00:26:57,635 --> 00:26:58,783
Deller, Glassmann...
Nothing but bedlam.

747
00:26:58,784 --> 00:26:59,287
- Whose?
- Mine.

748
00:26:59,288 --> 00:27:00,688
The filing system,
everything that wasn't burned.

749
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:01,142
Schilling...

750
00:27:01,143 --> 00:27:03,903
Leave the bottle where it is, Schilling.
Some other time. Got the...

751
00:27:03,904 --> 00:27:05,717
those blockheads in the Fire Department
ruined with water.

752
00:27:05,718 --> 00:27:07,726
You'd think they would show
some respect for important records.

753
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:08,687
Graeber. Paul and Marie.

754
00:27:08,688 --> 00:27:09,752
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.

755
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,313
Yes! Where are they?

756
00:27:10,314 --> 00:27:11,714
You needn't shout.
18 Hakenstrasse is all I have.

757
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:12,527
He's found his beloved, Alma.

758
00:27:12,528 --> 00:27:13,816
What luck, Boettcher!
Where did you find her?

759
00:27:13,817 --> 00:27:15,301
- Try the missing person section.
- I've been there.

760
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:15,694
On the street.

761
00:27:15,695 --> 00:27:17,571
Then the food ration office,
if they're alive, they've got to eat!

762
00:27:17,572 --> 00:27:18,412
She was simply standing there.

763
00:27:18,413 --> 00:27:20,009
I've been there too. And the Red Cross
and the hospital.

764
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,224
I'd been running through
twenty villages looking for her.

765
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:23,177
What did you say when you saw her?

766
00:27:23,178 --> 00:27:24,346
It's closing time.
Come back tomorrow.

767
00:27:24,347 --> 00:27:25,267
I didn't recognise her.

768
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,300
I just passed her by
and suddenly a voice said, "Herman?

769
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:28,381
Skinny women, skinny women,

770
00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:28,942
"Don't you know me?"

771
00:27:28,943 --> 00:27:30,783
ask them a question
you're in for a strafing.

772
00:27:30,784 --> 00:27:32,072
How could I be expected
to recognise a woman.

773
00:27:32,073 --> 00:27:33,725
It's the same every place, Graeber.
Nobody knows anything.

774
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:34,896
Who once was a proud 200 pounds.

775
00:27:34,897 --> 00:27:36,512
Almost used up my whole furlough
looking for my wife.

776
00:27:36,513 --> 00:27:37,274
And now is a measly 1 1 2?

777
00:27:37,275 --> 00:27:37,995
I'm just starting.

778
00:27:37,996 --> 00:27:39,452
You're the most ungrateful creature
I've ever seen.

779
00:27:39,453 --> 00:27:40,405
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

780
00:27:40,406 --> 00:27:41,610
- How about a little strategy?
- Strategy?

781
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:43,291
Who ever heard of loving
a woman by the ton? You deserve...

782
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:45,252
Whenever you ask for your parents,
why don't you ask for my wife too?

783
00:27:45,253 --> 00:27:47,129
I deserve after two years at the front,
my wife as she used to be.

784
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,054
- I'll do the same.
- All right.

785
00:27:48,055 --> 00:27:49,623
But she's alive, you dope,
you can fatten her up again.

786
00:27:49,624 --> 00:27:51,540
See, that way we can cover double
territory. Her name is Alma.

787
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:52,297
You better write this down.

788
00:27:52,298 --> 00:27:52,898
How? With what?

789
00:27:52,899 --> 00:27:53,499
Alma Boettcher.

790
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,340
With only five days left
of my furlough? How?

791
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:55,878
Excuse me.

792
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,080
I love my wife, but I needed all of her.

793
00:27:58,081 --> 00:28:00,477
Oh, skinny, skinny!
Now take a look at Alma!

794
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,160
Some woman, eh? Built like
a brewery horse and twice as strong!

795
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:03,481
Goodbye.

796
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,839
All solid muscle.
Fightin' or lovin', the house shook!

797
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,074
Pictures fell off the wall!

798
00:28:09,075 --> 00:28:10,915
Only reason I joined the Army
was to rest up.

799
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:13,196
Think of it. A woman like that
waiting for me somewhere,

800
00:28:13,197 --> 00:28:13,449
(Panting)

801
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,074
and I spend my nights
playing cards down at the infirmary

802
00:28:15,075 --> 00:28:15,831
I know I'm late. I'm sorry.

803
00:28:15,933 --> 00:28:17,221
But I wasn't satisfied just getting
a day off

804
00:28:17,222 --> 00:28:18,198
with a bunch of ugly soldiers.

805
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:20,341
I asked for a week. Of course,
the answer was no! What's wrong?

806
00:28:20,342 --> 00:28:21,238
Hey, you got some place to stay?

807
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,698
They told me down at
the District Military Office.

808
00:28:22,699 --> 00:28:22,899
This.

809
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,440
To report to the barracks
for bombed out men on leave.

810
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:26,401
To save time I got the applications.
They require full information...

811
00:28:26,402 --> 00:28:28,334
That's where I am. Come on,
I'll get you to the barrack's infirmary.

812
00:28:28,335 --> 00:28:30,267
- The food's better down there.
- But there's nothing wrong with me.

813
00:28:30,268 --> 00:28:31,948
There's nothing wrong with me.
I happen to know an orderly.

814
00:28:31,949 --> 00:28:32,565
...about our families.

815
00:28:32,566 --> 00:28:34,750
He can get you in without even seeing
a doctor. Might cost some cigarettes...

816
00:28:34,751 --> 00:28:35,311
Our families? I see.

817
00:28:35,312 --> 00:28:37,104
A doctor! Doctor Kruse,
he's been treating my mother for years.

818
00:28:37,105 --> 00:28:38,589
And because my father's in a camp
you think that...?

819
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,830
He's sure to know where she is.

820
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:41,231
They may check the Gestapo records.

821
00:28:41,232 --> 00:28:42,672
I'll meet you at the barracks later.

822
00:28:42,673 --> 00:28:46,716
If you're brought to their attention,
someone may get a dangerous notion.

823
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,558
Those things happen.

824
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,989
I know they do.

825
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,430
Ernst, I want to go through with it.

826
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,113
You're not afraid?

827
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,071
No.

828
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,919
Only, don't ask me why
my hands are shaking.

829
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,319
(Doorbell)

830
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,233
Yes?

831
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,828
- ls the Doctor at home?
- Doctor Kruse no longer practises.

832
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,428
Well can I see him anyway please?
I only want to ask him...

833
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,887
Doctor no longer lives here.

834
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:20,928
But that's his name plate.

835
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:21,729
Take a seat, please.

836
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,850
Oh, well. That should have been
taken down long ago.

837
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:25,272
Who is it?

838
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,313
Frau Lieser, is there someone for me?

839
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,635
Elisabeth!

840
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,914
You are Elisabeth Kruse, aren't you?

841
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,314
What is it you want?

842
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,360
Well, I don't want to disturb
anybody, but...

843
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:45,281
Go out on the corridor
and watch me from there.

844
00:29:45,282 --> 00:29:46,242
Well, your father was...

845
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:47,569
Oh, it's about my...
Come in.

846
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,410
If you see me lay my cap down,
leave at once.

847
00:29:49,411 --> 00:29:51,039
Don't go home.

848
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,720
(Door slams shut)

849
00:29:51,721 --> 00:29:54,681
Go to the Jahnplatz Art Museum,
Professor Pohlmann lives right behind it.

850
00:29:54,682 --> 00:29:55,874
Wait for me there.

851
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,831
- But Ernst...
- Please, do as I say.

852
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,632
I do know you.

853
00:30:09,236 --> 00:30:10,596
Didn't you go to high school here?

854
00:30:10,597 --> 00:30:11,317
- Graeber.
- Yes.

855
00:30:11,318 --> 00:30:12,238
Yes, I'm Ernst Graeber.

856
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:15,279
Your applica... What are you staring at?
Haven't you ever seen a glass eye?

857
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,280
Ernst Graeber, of course.

858
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,755
Oh, it's been years.

859
00:30:17,756 --> 00:30:20,276
Yes, but... it's a different colour
from the other. It's blue.

860
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:20,877
At least seven.

861
00:30:20,878 --> 00:30:22,358
I didn't really recognise you either.

862
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,797
It's not blue, it's brown.
My real eye is blue.

863
00:30:23,798 --> 00:30:25,278
Just guessed. You've changed so much.

864
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,043
I broke the other one this morning
and had none to replace it.

865
00:30:27,044 --> 00:30:28,303
Frauline Kruse! Aren't you ashamed?

866
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:29,396
I had to borrow this brown one.

867
00:30:29,397 --> 00:30:30,316
Entertaining a man in your room!

868
00:30:30,317 --> 00:30:31,277
Where is Frauline Kruse?

869
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:32,118
The nerve! The nerve!

870
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:34,839
She had to step out for a moment.
Everything's all right, isn't it?

871
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,720
Who is that crocodile?

872
00:30:35,721 --> 00:30:36,877
I'll ask the questions.

873
00:30:36,988 --> 00:30:38,828
Is she the daughter
of Doctor Bernhard Kruse?

874
00:30:38,829 --> 00:30:39,589
An official tenant.

875
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,160
Bombed out of her own place
and put here by the authorities.

876
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:43,361
- Yes, but she...
- But what?

877
00:30:43,362 --> 00:30:43,682
Nothing.

878
00:30:43,683 --> 00:30:44,827
They moved in three more since.

879
00:30:44,828 --> 00:30:47,508
Doctor Kruse doesn't practise anymore.
Talked too much, didn't he?

880
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:48,873
Don't you have anything to say about it?

881
00:30:49,002 --> 00:30:50,990
I was told I should be happy
I'm allowed to have this room for myself.

882
00:30:50,991 --> 00:30:51,511
Well, he did.

883
00:30:51,512 --> 00:30:52,452
But he saved this eye for me.

884
00:30:52,453 --> 00:30:54,453
She's a member of
the Women's Corps of the Party.

885
00:30:54,454 --> 00:30:55,374
We'll say he's retired.

886
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:56,975
I suppose that gives her special rights.

887
00:30:56,976 --> 00:30:58,616
According to the official version, he is.

888
00:30:58,617 --> 00:30:59,696
When do you want to get married?

889
00:30:59,697 --> 00:31:01,082
She'll probably come back to listen.

890
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:03,283
As soon as possible.
You know how short furloughs are.

891
00:31:03,284 --> 00:31:04,844
(♪ Military band music blasts on radio)

892
00:31:04,845 --> 00:31:06,405
You can get married at once. Sign here.

893
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:10,079
Your papers are in order.
But Frauline Kruse has to sign too.

894
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,638
- Are her papers in order?
- I already told you so.

895
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:14,519
What about my father?
What do you know of him?

896
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,680
Well, she'll be right here...

897
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,319
Your father?

898
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,640
My cap! I'll be back in a second.

899
00:31:18,641 --> 00:31:20,036
Nothing. What should I know?

900
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,878
You have no news of him?

901
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,991
I only arrived last night from Russia.

902
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,400
I was hoping to get some news
from him about my parents,

903
00:31:27,401 --> 00:31:28,041
Elisabeth! Wait!

904
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:28,999
I can't locate them.

905
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,280
My father isn't here anymore.

906
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:32,441
Everything's all right.
We can be married right away.

907
00:31:32,442 --> 00:31:33,282
What happened to him?

908
00:31:33,283 --> 00:31:33,683
Oh, Ernst!

909
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,512
Oh, nothing... He's not here, that's all.

910
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:38,678
He was taken away four months ago.

911
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:40,557
Where do you want to go on your honeymoon?

912
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,606
We've got the whole rest of the day.

913
00:31:42,607 --> 00:31:43,647
Do we have to go anywhere?

914
00:31:43,648 --> 00:31:45,488
They don't tell me where he is,
or why, or...

915
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:48,489
Why don't we go home to my place
and not stir out until peace is declared?

916
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,970
I thought maybe you knew something...

917
00:31:49,971 --> 00:31:50,691
Or maybe not then.

918
00:31:50,692 --> 00:31:51,292
(♪ Music stops)

919
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,197
...you don't.

920
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,160
I'm sorry, I know nothing
about your family.

921
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:57,429
Frauline Kruse!

922
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,400
You have already filled one tub,
I heard you.

923
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:00,471
You'd better go now.

924
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,198
How dare you use all the hot water!

925
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,118
20 minutes I've been waiting to get in.

926
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:04,999
(Air raid sirens wail)

927
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,390
Frauline Kruse!

928
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,238
(Doorbell rings)

929
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,880
Go! Answer the door.

930
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:17,292
Frauline Kruse!
Open this door immediately or...

931
00:32:17,293 --> 00:32:18,973
They're coming earlier than usual tonight.

932
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:20,785
Preliminary warning!
Preliminary warning!

933
00:32:20,786 --> 00:32:21,350
Yes?

934
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,279
What is it?

935
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,400
I want every light out
and everybody to the shelter.

936
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,841
I did hear you calling me, didn't I?

937
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,432
Quietly and calmly now, do you hear?

938
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
Everybody to the shelter!

939
00:32:31,561 --> 00:32:33,070
Good evening.

940
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,240
Hurry! Hurry!

941
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:35,876
Excuse me.

942
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,558
Frau Lieser.

943
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,240
There's a package for an Ernst Graeber.

944
00:32:39,241 --> 00:32:39,481
Hurry!

945
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,191
That's for me.

946
00:32:47,372 --> 00:32:49,332
How dare you! How dare you!
I am a decent woman!

947
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,133
(Laboured breathing)

948
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,374
And while I'm in it
this is going to be a decent house.

949
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:53,477
Parsley.

950
00:32:53,582 --> 00:32:53,702
Oh?

951
00:32:53,703 --> 00:32:55,223
I'm going for the police this instant.

952
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,545
They were the only seeds I could find.

953
00:32:56,546 --> 00:32:58,002
And before I return,
that man better be out of here

954
00:32:58,003 --> 00:32:59,543
I wanted to see something green
and lovely grow again.

955
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:00,824
And you with him Frauline Kruse.

956
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:02,477
- ls there that much time?
- The shelter is in a basement.

957
00:33:02,478 --> 00:33:04,466
I know this is going to upset you, but...
my name is Frau Graeber now.

958
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:06,455
There isn't room for everybody
so if you don't hurry you won't get in.

959
00:33:06,456 --> 00:33:07,716
Ha! Do you think I'd fall for that old trick!

960
00:33:07,717 --> 00:33:08,012
What then?

961
00:33:08,013 --> 00:33:09,889
There's a community shelter
on Karlsplatz, just follow the others.

962
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,290
- You're not only shameless, you're...
- Read it!

963
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:12,243
You'll have no trouble finding it.

964
00:33:12,244 --> 00:33:15,172
I told you Frau Lieser wouldn't be happy
till she saw our marriage certificate.

965
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:17,217
I'd rather wait for you, but er...
Do those have to be watered just now?

966
00:33:17,218 --> 00:33:18,870
I can see she's delighted.
It's written all over her face.

967
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:19,991
Yes. I won't be stampeded...

968
00:33:19,992 --> 00:33:21,112
(Woman tenant) Hurry, hurry!

969
00:33:21,113 --> 00:33:22,393
You wanted to go to the bathroom?
Go!

970
00:33:22,394 --> 00:33:22,914
...Like them!

971
00:33:22,915 --> 00:33:24,580
Frauline Kruse, as block warden
I warn you officially,

972
00:33:24,581 --> 00:33:24,981
(Laughter)

973
00:33:24,982 --> 00:33:26,342
I couldn't have planned it better!

974
00:33:26,343 --> 00:33:28,388
You'll be reported if again
you don't go to the shelter.

975
00:33:28,389 --> 00:33:30,269
I'm even for everything
she's ever done to me.

976
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,270
I hope that isn't the only reason
you married me?

977
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:33,716
- What is it?
- From Binding. Wedding present.

978
00:33:33,717 --> 00:33:35,148
One of the few sensible things
a soldier learns.

979
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:35,597
How did he know?

980
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:36,774
Is to take cover when things start to fly.

981
00:33:36,775 --> 00:33:38,575
Must have phoned the barracks.
Look at this.

982
00:33:38,576 --> 00:33:39,936
- Then take it!
- Don't be angry!

983
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:40,497
I'm not angry.

984
00:33:40,498 --> 00:33:42,875
Dutch chocolate, Polish ham,
brandied peaches.

985
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,640
It's just that... I will not be frightened.

986
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:46,041
Champagne.

987
00:33:46,042 --> 00:33:47,322
I don't have the proper glasses.

988
00:33:47,323 --> 00:33:49,079
You don't have to be,
I'm frightened enough for both of us.

989
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,368
Never mind that.
Any kind of glasses will do.

990
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:52,071
Those bombs don't give
a good Lord damn who they fall on.

991
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:54,198
Just because Frau Crocodile
happens to be the warden...

992
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,571
In Paris we drank champagne
out of our canteens.

993
00:33:55,572 --> 00:33:56,372
It's more than that.

994
00:33:56,373 --> 00:33:56,653
(Sighs)

995
00:33:56,654 --> 00:33:57,374
It's... Well, I...

996
00:33:57,375 --> 00:33:59,118
All my life I hoped one day to go to Paris.

997
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:01,479
I have to do something,
no matter how small and laughable,

998
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,512
Perhaps for my honeymoon.

999
00:34:02,524 --> 00:34:04,204
But we'd never be welcome there, would we?

1000
00:34:04,205 --> 00:34:06,045
To defend what's left
of my personal freedom.

1001
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,526
Did they hate you very much in Paris?

1002
00:34:07,527 --> 00:34:09,567
Because if I can,
then others certainly can and...

1003
00:34:09,568 --> 00:34:10,928
I was only there in the beginning.

1004
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:13,269
And Holland? With its canals
and sail boats.

1005
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,355
You're a strange girl.

1006
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,400
Would we be welcome there?

1007
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:17,481
- I promised myself I would not run...
- All right.

1008
00:34:17,482 --> 00:34:17,802
Holland?

1009
00:34:17,803 --> 00:34:19,438
I think not.

1010
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,320
Let's walk.

1011
00:34:21,321 --> 00:34:23,151
We destroyed Rotterdam.

1012
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,517
My father and mother went
to Hildesheim for their honeymoon.

1013
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,234
They told me about
a thousand-year-old rose vine

1014
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,237
climbing up the side of the old cathedral.

1015
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,390
That's destroyed now too I guess.

1016
00:34:38,471 --> 00:34:39,911
All aboard. Kindly step to the rear.

1017
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:42,832
So even if we could go on a honeymoon
there's no place for us, is there?

1018
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:43,593
To the rear please.

1019
00:34:43,594 --> 00:34:45,632
Keep moving. Welcome, friend.
I'm glad you could make it.

1020
00:34:45,633 --> 00:34:47,248
It's all been destroyed by bombs or hatred.

1021
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:47,649
Elisabeth.

1022
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,690
Are you enjoying yourself?

1023
00:34:48,691 --> 00:34:50,891
I might if I could figure out
how you breathe in here.

1024
00:34:50,892 --> 00:34:51,612
I know, I'm sorry.

1025
00:34:51,613 --> 00:34:54,533
Oh, you don't. We have all been trained
not to breathe during the raids.

1026
00:34:54,534 --> 00:34:55,454
To us. Wherever we are.

1027
00:34:55,455 --> 00:34:55,695
To us.

1028
00:34:55,696 --> 00:34:59,553
(Chuckles)
No self-respecting cave dweller would!

1029
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,120
Kindly step to the rear
of our pleasure car. Move on please.

1030
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:03,112
(Glass smashes)

1031
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,119
(Mouths words)

1032
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,239
- I saw that in a movie once!
- So did I!

1033
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,435
(Child whines)

1034
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,870
Only I forget who cleaned it up.

1035
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,638
Oh?

1036
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,879
You feel it, Ernst?
It's fear.

1037
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,919
(Groans)

1038
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,400
I'm pretty sure it was someone with shoes.

1039
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:22,239
(Heavy drone of approaching aircraft)

1040
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,753
Better let me.

1041
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,035
(Distant explosions)

1042
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,277
"Shortening of line successful.

1043
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,198
"Heavy losses inflicted on enemy
at the Prut River."

1044
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,357
Sounds simple, doesn't it?
Not a word about our losses.

1045
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,789
Thank God you weren't there.

1046
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,794
Men I knew better than my own family.

1047
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,833
Watch out for the broken glass.

1048
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,397
Ernst? Let's both try to forget
everything outside this room.

1049
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,596
Excuse me.

1050
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,271
Frau Langer?

1051
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,552
Remember me?

1052
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,352
Ernst Graeber.

1053
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,277
Yes! Ernst Graeber.

1054
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,152
Yes.

1055
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,280
Do you know where my parents are?

1056
00:36:20,281 --> 00:36:22,233
This is the first night of our marriage.

1057
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,720
Maybe we'll have the same dream...

1058
00:36:23,721 --> 00:36:24,751
They're dead.

1059
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,920
...that time stands still.

1060
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:28,999
My Lena and my August, too.

1061
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,720
And in our dreams we might find a place
where people won't hate us.

1062
00:36:31,721 --> 00:36:32,961
You knew them both, didn't you?

1063
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:33,222
Dead?

1064
00:36:33,223 --> 00:36:35,583
And won't ask our nationality,
only if we love each other,

1065
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:38,790
How did it happen? When?

1066
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,798
Did you see it?

1067
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:41,679
And that will be our passport
and visa enough.

1068
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,033
There was nothing to see.

1069
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,391
It was all... fire.

1070
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,759
Fire... Shrieking!

1071
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,708
You there, soldier!

1072
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,829
I didn't see my Lena either.

1073
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,310
I've been waiting for you to show up.

1074
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,440
I have something for you.

1075
00:36:55,441 --> 00:36:57,075
They wouldn't let me near her.

1076
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,879
Why would they do a thing like that, Ernst?

1077
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,836
It came in the mail for Graeber.

1078
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,680
It was sent to Ernst Graeber at the front
and forwarded from there.

1079
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:06,472
Why? Why?

1080
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,080
Must have just missed you, huh?

1081
00:37:08,081 --> 00:37:09,038
Herr Langer...

1082
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,879
She... she still can't grasp it, Ernst.

1083
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,679
Can you?

1084
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,200
- It's from my mother.
- Your mother!

1085
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:15,607
Or you?

1086
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,648
There's no return address.

1087
00:37:16,649 --> 00:37:18,489
If you can, you are no better
than the one...

1088
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,930
They're alive! My parents are alive!

1089
00:37:19,931 --> 00:37:21,319
...who caused...

1090
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,320
This was sent the day they were being
evacuated! They don't know where to.

1091
00:37:24,321 --> 00:37:24,561
(Sobs)

1092
00:37:24,562 --> 00:37:26,878
They'll let me know their address
as soon as they have one.

1093
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:29,039
She says my mother
and father are dead. Is that true?

1094
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,080
She tells me not to worry!

1095
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,631
She doesn't know, Ernst.
She thinks...

1096
00:37:31,632 --> 00:37:32,512
I'm very glad for you.

1097
00:37:32,513 --> 00:37:34,353
...that everyone who isn't here
must be dead.

1098
00:37:34,354 --> 00:37:37,314
I'll take your notice down. There are
so many others and so little space.

1099
00:37:37,315 --> 00:37:38,315
Because our children are.

1100
00:37:38,316 --> 00:37:38,956
She says things.

1101
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,349
We've been reported because of it.

1102
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,516
Have you seen my parents at all?

1103
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,791
Yes, two or three weeks ago
on the street. Not since then.

1104
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,079
How did they look, were they well?

1105
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,680
Herr Graeber?

1106
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:51,671
They were alive, Ernst.

1107
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,073
Yes?

1108
00:37:54,078 --> 00:37:56,598
I've something for your wife.
It came after she left for work.

1109
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:57,519
I'm sorry, Herr Langer.

1110
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,920
I promised I'd see that she get it.

1111
00:37:58,921 --> 00:37:59,841
I'm sorry about your...

1112
00:37:59,842 --> 00:38:01,762
I'll tell her. I know
she'll be deeply touched.

1113
00:38:01,763 --> 00:38:05,115
A summons from the Gestapo.
She's to report tomorrow at 4 o'clock.

1114
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,757
(Drone of aircraft climaxes
and begins to fade)

1115
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,878
They are flying past.

1116
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,358
Did those people know anything
about your parents?

1117
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,152
No.

1118
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,511
Thank God they didn't attack.
They are going somewhere else.

1119
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,392
- Oh, Arnold?
- Yes?

1120
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,954
- Did you turn off the gas?
- I don't know.

1121
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,798
Ah, that means you didn't.

1122
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,638
Dinner will be burnt to a crisp.

1123
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,637
Life goes on again!

1124
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,432
(Laughs)

1125
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,473
When the all-clear sounds, if we're near
the door, we can get out sooner.

1126
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,591
Frau Lieser isn't home yet.

1127
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,233
How can you tell?

1128
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,033
If she were home,
we'd be hearing her radio by now.

1129
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,480
The home front relay a broadcast.

1130
00:39:02,481 --> 00:39:05,281
She turns it on full to blast it
into the ears of all the neighbours.

1131
00:39:05,282 --> 00:39:06,487
- Professor Pohlmann.
- What is it?

1132
00:39:06,488 --> 00:39:08,807
I don't know how you stand living
with her. You ought to move.

1133
00:39:08,808 --> 00:39:10,848
- I'm Ernst Graeber, a former pupil.
- Graeber...!

1134
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,689
I can't. As long as I'm here I can hope
that my father will come back.

1135
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:15,370
If I went away it would be like giving up.

1136
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:16,051
What do you want?

1137
00:39:16,052 --> 00:39:18,074
Can I see you for a few moments, Professor?

1138
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,519
I need your advice.

1139
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,677
I no longer have the right
to receive students.

1140
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,038
I must talk to you, Professor.

1141
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:24,439
Thank you.

1142
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,680
There's no one else I can go to.
Please let me come in.

1143
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:29,318
Say, would you like to go somewhere?
For a cup of tea or something?

1144
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:30,519
Anyone see you come back here?

1145
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,440
You're just home on furlough, I'm sure
you want other company than mine.

1146
00:39:33,441 --> 00:39:33,561
No.

1147
00:39:33,562 --> 00:39:34,642
Only the workmen out front.

1148
00:39:34,643 --> 00:39:35,599
Workmen?

1149
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,158
Good night.

1150
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:37,719
They may be workmen but one may not be.

1151
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,719
Good night.

1152
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,800
I'm being watched, Graeber.

1153
00:39:39,801 --> 00:39:41,039
Elisabeth!

1154
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,157
Come back another time,
but make sure no one is around.

1155
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,080
Knock twice slowly,
then twice more quickly.

1156
00:39:46,081 --> 00:39:48,876
Here's something for you.

1157
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,274
Oh?

1158
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,479
Graeber?

1159
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,880
- It's food. And I thought...
- Yes. I know those packages.

1160
00:39:53,881 --> 00:39:54,041
Yes.

1161
00:39:54,048 --> 00:39:56,728
If the workmen ask you anything,
tell them I wouldn't talk to you.

1162
00:39:56,729 --> 00:39:57,969
But... I'd like you to have it.

1163
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,430
Or even open the door.

1164
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,800
I've nobody else to give it to.

1165
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:04,840
(Air raid sirens sound)

1166
00:40:04,841 --> 00:40:07,434
And that's the only reason
you're giving it to me?

1167
00:40:07,444 --> 00:40:09,964
You, soldier. The shelter's a block over.
Come with us. Hurry!

1168
00:40:09,965 --> 00:40:11,045
What's the matter with you?

1169
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:13,487
It's always food packages, cigarettes
and French perfume.

1170
00:40:13,488 --> 00:40:14,208
In broad daylight?

1171
00:40:14,209 --> 00:40:15,689
You soldiers expect every woman to...

1172
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:18,130
They're going to make sure they get
the factories this time.

1173
00:40:18,131 --> 00:40:19,159
How do you know what I expect?

1174
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,520
I wanted to give you this
because I thought you'd like it.

1175
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:23,121
Not because I have to buy my way around.

1176
00:40:23,122 --> 00:40:23,842
(Aircraft engines)

1177
00:40:23,843 --> 00:40:27,469
I'm sorry, but fighting
is not my idea of fun.

1178
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,636
Not even with you. Goodnight.

1179
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,470
(Gasps)

1180
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,718
Good evening, soldier.

1181
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,912
Why don't you tell me all about it?

1182
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,080
Here, you take it.

1183
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,998
(Bells chime)

1184
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,639
And you never saw such legs!

1185
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,230
Long, beautiful and slim!

1186
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,432
And such eyes! And such teeth!

1187
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,198
Like a white gardenia flower.

1188
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,436
So, I opened the bottle of brandy.

1189
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,870
50-year-old Napoleon,
expensive, but this was worth it.

1190
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,392
It took only two glasses.
Ah, that Napoleon!

1191
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,954
So? Well, and then?

1192
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,231
Well that's as far as a cavalier can tell
a story and still be in good taste.

1193
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,476
It's an obscenity, Reuter.
Betraying your wife...

1194
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,999
Oh, idiot!

1195
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,510
How can a man betray his wife when
he doesn't even know if she's alive?

1196
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,790
If she were here, I wouldn't betray her.

1197
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,595
I am simply the victim of army life.
I'm a martyr.

1198
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,952
Oh, gentlemen, we haven't welcomed
Graeber here to our club.

1199
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,992
- Schilling, the bottle.
- Here, here.

1200
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,951
This is home made potato schnapps,

1201
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,594
it's an insult to the stomach
but it's all that's available.

1202
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,518
Give me that! You know the doctor
told you to lay off this stuff.

1203
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,320
Everybody always wants to take care of me.

1204
00:42:06,321 --> 00:42:07,361
You crazy fool! Clear out!

1205
00:42:07,362 --> 00:42:10,774
All my life, caviar and champagne -
now, in the Army, I get the gout.

1206
00:42:10,775 --> 00:42:11,895
Which in turn saves my life.

1207
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,016
Is that the uniform factory?

1208
00:42:13,017 --> 00:42:14,221
It was. What are you doing
on the streets?

1209
00:42:14,222 --> 00:42:15,762
It's better to be sick here
than healthy at the front.

1210
00:42:15,763 --> 00:42:17,848
My wife works there. Was there time
for everyone to get to the shelters?

1211
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:18,269
Give me that...

1212
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,645
You keep quiet!
I drink this to save my life.

1213
00:42:19,646 --> 00:42:21,726
There was a power breakdown.
Just before the alert.

1214
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:24,256
Come on. We've got more important
things to do than waste time on him.

1215
00:42:24,257 --> 00:42:25,657
Most of the workers were sent home.

1216
00:42:25,658 --> 00:42:26,658
The overcoat section too?

1217
00:42:26,659 --> 00:42:27,259
Give me a hand.

1218
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,109
How should I know?

1219
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,713
Now I can check all the villages. They're
crowded with people from the town.

1220
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,920
Don't they keep a record
of where people were sent?

1221
00:42:34,921 --> 00:42:37,001
Records may be
good enough for you, but not for me.

1222
00:42:37,002 --> 00:42:38,402
Why don't you go home and find out?

1223
00:42:38,403 --> 00:42:40,883
When you know your parents
are safe somewhere, you can relax.

1224
00:42:40,884 --> 00:42:43,004
But you can't relax just knowing
your wife is alive.

1225
00:42:43,005 --> 00:42:44,193
She's got to be with you.

1226
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,949
Especially when she weighs 200 pounds.

1227
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,320
(Panicked shouts)

1228
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:54,757
It's simple for you. You grab the first girl
that comes along and everything is fine.

1229
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,793
But with me, where do I find a woman
like my Alma?

1230
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,036
At the restaurant, down the street.

1231
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,676
The waitress.
And she weighs over 200 pounds.

1232
00:43:04,677 --> 00:43:06,557
Oh, fat. Tired, flabby, fat.
It's frightening.

1233
00:43:06,558 --> 00:43:08,718
- Frau Lieser, have you seen my wife?
- I don't know.

1234
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,319
Did she get home? Is she in the shelter?

1235
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,320
What shelter? We were flooded out,
can't you see?

1236
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:14,761
But my Alma... You could break a finger
trying to pinch her.

1237
00:43:14,891 --> 00:43:16,931
And now somebody else
is breaking his finger, huh?

1238
00:43:16,932 --> 00:43:18,852
- You don't know my Alma.
- Oh, I know, I know.

1239
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,030
She's waiting some place only for you.

1240
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,391
Like Nasick's wife, huh?
Hey, Nasick, tell them.

1241
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,990
Tell them how the whole Fire Department
was helping you wife wait for you.

1242
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,792
(Laughter)

1243
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,718
Reuter, one of these days,
as a special favour to Nasick,

1244
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,149
I'm going to cripple your other leg too.

1245
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,956
Graeber. Take my advice,
don't be a fool

1246
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,514
and waste your whole furlough
like Boettcher.

1247
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,676
Enjoy your life while you can.

1248
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,711
Have you any idea how long your life is?

1249
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,751
These days, who does?

1250
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,835
Three weeks. As long as your furlough,
three weeks of life.

1251
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,030
Then, death holds the trumps.

1252
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,869
Why, you've been home three days
already. That's three out of twenty one.

1253
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,798
Why that's as much as ten years
of normal life.

1254
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,190
Ten years of waste.

1255
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,948
Come on, let's get out of here.

1256
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,438
(Grunts)

1257
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,793
Records? Ha!
We can't even get them buried.

1258
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,276
If the air raids continue
I don't know what we will do.

1259
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,710
There is no space.
Did you try the other cem...

1260
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,274
(Huffs)

1261
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,193
Ernst!

1262
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,754
Ernst!

1263
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,753
Ernst!

1264
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,874
Oh!

1265
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,911
Elisabeth! Thank God you're here.

1266
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,793
I went to the factory,
they wouldn't let me get to you.

1267
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,115
I saved all I could.

1268
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,755
Thank you.

1269
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,350
Well, I suppose we'll sleep
in the streets tonight.

1270
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,518
But not this one, Ernst.
Any other I won't mind.

1271
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,715
Why don't we go to
the Jahnplatz Art Museum?

1272
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,751
It's an elegant ruin as ruins go

1273
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,678
and I want to see
Professor Pohlmann anyway.

1274
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,478
Pohlmann isn't home.

1275
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,636
I hope he'll like us for neighbours.

1276
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,595
When I was seven years old I wanted
to be a gypsy, just to live like this.

1277
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,350
A quiet night, a bed and a woman...
like you.

1278
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,630
That's what we used to
dream about in the field.

1279
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,833
- Did you get a letter?
- Oh, and what a letter!

1280
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,952
In all the excitement
I forgot to tell you about it.

1281
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,593
It's from my parents.

1282
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,915
They were being evacuated,
they didn't know where to.

1283
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,749
Then they're alive! And you forgot that.
How could you?

1284
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,599
(Footsteps)

1285
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,552
Is someone there?

1286
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,999
It's Pohlmann.

1287
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,193
It's me, Professor. Ernst Graeber.

1288
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,833
We were bombed out and I...

1289
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,757
We? Someone is with you?

1290
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,474
My wife.
I was married a few days ago.

1291
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,352
I see.

1292
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,710
It's all right, Josef.

1293
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,036
Ernst, Josef.

1294
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,230
It's better not to mention other names.

1295
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,476
I can't take you and your wife inside.

1296
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,795
You would be in great danger
if you were found there.

1297
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,434
With a man who is wanted.
I'm a Jew.

1298
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,516
Nothing may happen tonight.

1299
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,359
The city is always in confusion
after a raid but one never knows.

1300
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,074
Professor, I must talk to you.

1301
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,316
Come in for a few minutes.

1302
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,036
Have you any idea why the Gestapo
would want your wife?

1303
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,196
Her father's in a concentration camp.

1304
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,231
Then they must want information.

1305
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,319
What would you do, Josef?

1306
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,034
Hide. That's why I'm still alive.

1307
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,596
In any case, interrogation by the Gestapo
is something to be avoided.

1308
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,836
Josef is a specialist in these things.

1309
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,360
Couldn't I go in her place and find out
what they're up to?

1310
00:47:31,361 --> 00:47:33,475
They'll tell you nothing,
it's your wife they want.

1311
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,478
I know someone they would tell.
Oskar Binding.

1312
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,029
He's offered to help me. And he has
connections, Gestapo connections.

1313
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,718
He's bragged to me about them.

1314
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,195
To me too. And he proved it.

1315
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,871
I'm supposed to go back to the front
in ten days, and if I go, she'll be alone.

1316
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,117
I'll have to see Binding in the morning,
I don't know what else to do.

1317
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,559
Thank you for seeing me.

1318
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,352
Ernst.

1319
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,229
You said if you go. Are you thinking of
not going back?

1320
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,993
I must find out what will happen to
my wife. Until then I...

1321
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,111
If you desert, they will shoot you.

1322
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,152
There's a chance you could
escape alone, but not with your wife.

1323
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,633
That's practically impossible.

1324
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,638
If you know anyone hiding
you would be risking penalty of death.

1325
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,671
Are your parents alive, Ernst?

1326
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,668
Yes, but I haven't been able to find them.

1327
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,476
They would find them. Your wife too.
And they would use them to get you.

1328
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,993
So I must go back, just as before.

1329
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,429
And do the same things as before.

1330
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:37,676
But how? I don't believe in anything
I was taught anymore.

1331
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,917
Tell me, Professor, is there anything
left to believe in?

1332
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,869
Yes, there is.

1333
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,434
- What?
- God.

1334
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,074
- You still believe in him?
- More than ever.

1335
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,553
You never have any doubts?

1336
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,158
Of course I have.

1337
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,953
Without doubt, there would be
no need for faith.

1338
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,516
How can anyone believe in God
with all that's happening here?

1339
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,837
God is not responsible to us.

1340
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,077
We are responsible to God
for all that's happening here.

1341
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,192
If that's true, Professor,
how much am I responsible?

1342
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,356
Isn't there a time when taking orders stops

1343
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,550
and personal responsibility begins?

1344
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,318
When duty turns into crime

1345
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,749
and can no longer be excused
by blaming the leaders?

1346
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,155
I have to make a decision, Professor.
I must know!

1347
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,558
No one can make that decision for you,
Ernst, not even your teacher.

1348
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,353
Each man has to decide it for himself.

1349
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,797
But first you must face the truth,
no matter how grim.

1350
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,833
The war is lost, Ernst.
And more terrifying, it must be lost

1351
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,669
before our country can regain its soul.

1352
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,314
I'm not making it any easier for you, am I?

1353
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,911
No. Harder.

1354
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,156
You're smiling.

1355
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,953
Why aren't you screaming?

1356
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,993
I am screaming, you just don't hear it.

1357
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,638
(Footsteps approach)

1358
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,352
Graeber.

1359
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,836
Graeber!

1360
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,710
Are you awake, Graeber?
If you care to, you may wash up inside.

1361
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,400
Herr Pohlmann has some coffee on,
such as it is.

1362
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,240
If it's all right, I'd like to let her sleep
a little while longer.

1363
00:50:45,241 --> 00:50:47,310
Does she know about the Gestapo summons?

1364
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,271
I thought not.

1365
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,109
Graeber. If you find she's in danger
and need a place to hide her...

1366
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,229
Yes?

1367
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,316
Meet me at Saint Cunibert's.

1368
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,749
I'll have an address for you to go to.

1369
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,509
You'll find me up in the little storeroom
of the northern tower.

1370
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,029
I suggest you leave your belongings
in the church

1371
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,878
before going anywhere this morning.

1372
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,760
That way you can have your wife
meet you there without alarming her.

1373
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,789
Thank you.

1374
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,798
And be careful,
especially when you talk to Binding.

1375
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,236
(Door bell rings)

1376
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,430
(♪Piano plays Beethoven sonata)

1377
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,312
Come in!

1378
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,837
Come in!

1379
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:41,757
Well! Do come in said a spider to the fly.

1380
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,108
Come in!

1381
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,710
Ernst, boy! What a time
to come crawling!

1382
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,760
I know it's early
but when I heard the piano...

1383
00:51:48,761 --> 00:51:52,872
That's been going on all night.
What a party you've missed!

1384
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,753
But I'm glad you came by.
Now relax!

1385
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,472
Let's have a drink.

1386
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,917
Good, isn't he?

1387
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:11,913
I don't know anything about music but
everybody tells me Heini is a master.

1388
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,076
He's even been invited to Berchtesgaden

1389
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,398
where he played with such great art
he made the Fûhrer cry.

1390
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,910
(Slurring) Don't take my bottle!

1391
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,156
Mustn't take bottle from baby baby.

1392
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,033
Heini, I want you to meet my friend, Ernst.

1393
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,469
On furlough from the Russian front.

1394
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,793
Ha! I had a great time there,
finest time I ever had.

1395
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,310
Their vodka is 1 20 proof,
better than gasoline.

1396
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,069
We poured it down their throats,
made flame throwers out of them.

1397
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,832
You should have seen them jump!
Spitting fire!

1398
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,714
It was fun, baby!
Great fun.

1399
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,391
Tut tut tut.

1400
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,397
Careful with that.

1401
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,795
From our own recipe.

1402
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,639
We call it the layer cake.

1403
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,433
First you have the prisoners bring
a layer of wood.

1404
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,154
On which they lay down.

1405
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,669
Then, one bullet for each.

1406
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,233
Heini, careful with that!

1407
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,715
And you're ready for the next layer.

1408
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,150
Who also bring their own wood, and so on.

1409
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,317
Sprinkle liberally with gasoline.

1410
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,873
And...

1411
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,029
(Laughs)

1412
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,959
Herr Baby, your piano needs tuning.

1413
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,555
This note is flat.

1414
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,916
Mad fellow that Heini.

1415
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,474
He's the Commander of the camp here now.

1416
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,194
I don't enjoy that sort of thing.

1417
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,949
You know me,
much too soft-hearted.

1418
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,116
You think it's all right for him to do it?

1419
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,992
I don't think about it.

1420
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,509
I'm not responsible
for what other people do.

1421
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,471
No, none of us is ever responsible.

1422
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,560
That's what we tell ourselves
at the front, too,

1423
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,477
when we're ordered to shoot hostages.

1424
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,113
Your vodka, Ernst.

1425
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,390
You've shot civilians?

1426
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,589
Yes I have.

1427
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,109
Drink!

1428
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,673
You're one of us.

1429
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,997
I guess I am.

1430
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:39,472
- Heini!
- Late, baby, late. Duty calls.

1431
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,955
- Shall I phone for your car?
- I want to walk.

1432
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,036
Ernst could take my car and drive you...

1433
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,516
I said I walk! Think I can?

1434
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,152
(Door slams)

1435
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,795
He's in one of his moods.

1436
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,872
The concentration camp
will be hell tonight.

1437
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,350
Another... layer cake?

1438
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,993
What's the difference how people die?

1439
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:19,193
They're equally dead.
You've killed lots of them yourself.

1440
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,630
Maybe not the right ones.

1441
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,711
Ernst, I'm very drunk.

1442
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,751
I don't understand a word you say.

1443
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,440
So don't say anymore.

1444
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,151
You're right.

1445
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:40,233
I... I'd better not.

1446
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:48,159
Where are you going?
You're always running away.

1447
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,518
Goodbye, Oskar.

1448
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,830
Who do I see about this?

1449
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,235
This is for Elisabeth Kruse.

1450
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,477
I'm her husband. It came after she left
for work this morning, I thought...

1451
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,637
Room 72. Cellar floor.

1452
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,399
Your wife is
the daughter of Bernhard Kruse?

1453
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,839
Yes.

1454
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,395
Sign here. Kruse.

1455
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,034
Under your signature write,
"Husband of Elisabeth Kruse"

1456
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,072
and the date and registry office
of your marriage.

1457
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,436
Sign.

1458
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,595
The Kruse package.

1459
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,955
For what am I signing?

1460
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,112
The receipt for the ashes
of Bernhard Kruse.

1461
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,909
Cause of death... heart disease.

1462
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,996
Sure.

1463
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,472
What else?

1464
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,958
Complete discretion is to be exercised.

1465
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:11,834
And, er... no death notices
in the papers.

1466
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,598
Understand?

1467
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,754
- Josef.
- Well?

1468
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,438
It was this.

1469
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,118
Her father's ashes.

1470
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,231
I went to Pohlmann's, he wasn't there.

1471
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,430
Pohlmann has been arrested.

1472
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,993
He saw them coming.

1473
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,078
He ran into the street
to draw them away from the house

1474
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,191
so that I could get away.

1475
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,313
A cigar box, it's almost like a coffin.

1476
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,910
Usually they use old tin cans
or paper bags.

1477
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,110
You knew him?

1478
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,993
He was our family physician.

1479
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:50,352
A fine man, and this is all it comes to.

1480
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,438
What do you think I should do with it?
She'll be here soon.

1481
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,710
There are graves in the church garden.

1482
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,515
It's consecrated ground
if that's what you want.

1483
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,995
What will happen to Pohlmann?

1484
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,519
And you?

1485
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,200
If I'm not caught, I'll survive.

1486
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,753
You must hate us.

1487
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,393
Hate.

1488
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,750
Hate makes one forget to be cautious.

1489
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,230
Besides, I remember the time before...

1490
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,318
the Germany I grew up in and loved.

1491
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,032
And there's Pohlmann.

1492
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,675
Am I to hate him? Or Pastor Brenner
who hides me here?

1493
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,390
Shall I hate them?

1494
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:32,354
- Are there many like them?
- Yes. Not enough, but many.

1495
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,357
It isn't hopeless.

1496
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,596
You say that there's h ope!

1497
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,712
Of course.
I'm alive, isn't that proof?

1498
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,592
You'd better go now.

1499
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,837
It will be kinder if you've buried that
before your wife comes.

1500
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,598
Good luck, Ernst.

1501
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,990
Good luck, Josef.

1502
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,759
Is it your wish that the child be baptised
and brought up in this faith?

1503
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:18,949
Yes.

1504
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,548
I baptise you Christina Renata

1505
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,477
in the name of the Father,

1506
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,398
the Son,

1507
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:29,159
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

1508
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,953
May the Lord bless you and keep you.

1509
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,713
Amen.

1510
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,714
Ernst, I've nothing but good news!

1511
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:47,389
There's no work until the factory
can be moved. At least three days!

1512
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,509
That's wonderful.

1513
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,756
We can sleep late and do anything we like.

1514
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,518
It's a miracle, isn't it?

1515
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,471
It would be if we had a place to sleep.

1516
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,960
We can't stay here, they only take
families with children.

1517
01:01:56,961 --> 01:02:00,679
But I only told you the first miracle,
the second you have to see to believe.

1518
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,074
It's not very far, we...

1519
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,758
What are you talking about?

1520
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:07,395
You're wasting time!
Let's get our things and go.

1521
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,477
It's hardly touched.
Even some of the windows are in.

1522
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:26,355
- lt must be a mirage.
- No, no it's real. I'll show you.

1523
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,993
Frau Witte!
This is my husband.

1524
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,554
- Good evening, Herr Graeber.
- Good evening.

1525
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,911
Yes, he's everything you said.
He is handsome! And his eyes...

1526
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:58,828
- We're not late, are we?
- Late? One is always on time!

1527
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,952
But first you'll want to take
your things to your room.

1528
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,877
How did you find this place?

1529
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,798
By accident. The street
I meant to take was blocked.

1530
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:13,279
I really don't serve meals anymore,
not for two years,

1531
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,755
but I couldn't say no to your wife.

1532
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:16,869
You too, eh?

1533
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,515
So I decided the butcher
wouldn't say no to me either.

1534
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:24,553
In the soup, you'll find
a little piece of sausage.

1535
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:28,070
It's my daughter's room, her name was Ilse.

1536
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,909
It was the second air raid
she didn't come home.

1537
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:35,999
I never reported it, I didn't want
anyone else in her room.

1538
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,156
But I want you to have it.

1539
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,592
Please, let her stay on here,
I have no one else.

1540
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,519
Thank you.

1541
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,232
When you are ready for dinner,

1542
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:49,557
give me five minutes warning
so I'll have the table set.

1543
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,754
I want our house to be
exactly like this one.

1544
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,991
Tiled stove and... everything.

1545
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,596
Can't you see it, Ernst?

1546
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,075
Our families together for Sunday dinners,

1547
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,794
children climbing all over them.

1548
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,478
(Sighs)

1549
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,511
Everybody talking at once.

1550
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,957
I didn't know you wanted children so much.

1551
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,510
It's your children I want to have.

1552
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:27,915
In times like these
doesn't that frighten you?

1553
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:33,069
Other things frighten me more,
like not having them.

1554
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,192
My father's brought a thousand babies
into the world.

1555
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,471
But wait till you see his face
when he holds ours.

1556
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,749
Oh, how he'll spoil them!

1557
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,119
What is it?

1558
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,554
Nothing.

1559
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:50,318
Ernst?

1560
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,272
What aren't you telling me?
There's something!

1561
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,877
You're going away.

1562
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,673
No, I would have told you that.

1563
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,791
Then what?

1564
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,150
Is it something I did?

1565
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,316
Something I didn't do?

1566
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:13,231
My father.

1567
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,998
Dead?

1568
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,597
Dead.

1569
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:26,428
There were still a few bottles of wine
left in the cellar.

1570
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,471
And I thought I'll...

1571
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,950
Shall I serve dinner now?

1572
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,799
Yes, Frau Witte, please.

1573
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,551
Soldier, you must be insane.

1574
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,911
New orders come through every hour
cancelling furloughs.

1575
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:05,079
But you're not satisfied with even
all your furlough! You want it extended.

1576
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,189
Sir, my wife...

1577
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:10,029
Broke her leg? Is having twins?
Or double pneumonia? Which?

1578
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,470
We were just married, sir.
We've had very little time together.

1579
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:16,637
Even if it meant one more day,
I had to take the chance to ask.

1580
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:19,194
You're due out on a troop transport.

1581
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:23,313
The train leaves at 6 in the morning
and you must be on it.

1582
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,757
Report here at 5.

1583
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,951
Even Reuter would approve of
Frau Witte's wines.

1584
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,833
Berndtcassler, 1 935.

1585
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,713
According to Reuter,
the perfect wine for lobster...

1586
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,831
if we just had some lobster!

1587
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,633
Don't open it, Ernst.
It doesn't do any good.

1588
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,159
This one will.

1589
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,353
(Sobs)

1590
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,790
I'm not really crying.

1591
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,116
And if I do cry, don't worry about it.

1592
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:03,073
It isn't sorrow. I'm happy.

1593
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,076
So much has happened in these weeks,

1594
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,270
I can't press it all into myself.

1595
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:12,037
I've tried, but it won't go.

1596
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,995
Tonight you must be patient with me.

1597
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:20,518
I wish I'd taken you out of the city,

1598
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,710
to a village or somewhere.

1599
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:26,196
Even if I didn't have to work
at the factory, I'd want to stay here.

1600
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,437
Because I'll need to be some place
where I've been with you.

1601
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,358
Do you want to sleep now?

1602
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:36,995
I can sleep on the train all the way there.

1603
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,918
Then? Will you ever have a bed?

1604
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:44,110
The best I can hope for after tomorrow
is a field cart

1605
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,231
or a sack of hay from time to time.

1606
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:50,433
It's not that bad. You get used to it
soon enough. And summer's coming.

1607
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,118
It's the winter that...

1608
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,830
As soon as I hear from my parents
I'll send you their address.

1609
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,713
If they're anywhere close,
try to visit them.

1610
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,512
I will.

1611
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,631
They're gonna love you.

1612
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,398
Kiss them from me.

1613
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,875
(Air raid sirens begin)

1614
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,831
(Man's voice) Everyone to the shelter!
Lights out.

1615
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:26,952
Herr Graeber!

1616
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,039
Herr Graeber, the air raid shelter is
around the corner on Leibingstrasse.

1617
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,479
Ernst!

1618
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,033
No matter what happens,

1619
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:40,118
I don't want to spend my last night
with you in a cellar.

1620
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,028
Could we stay?

1621
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:47,472
I understand. I'll tell the warden
that everyone is out of the house.

1622
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,315
(Engines drone)

1623
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,511
(Explosions begin)

1624
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,471
Ernst.

1625
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,353
What happens if the planes
destroy the station?

1626
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:06,959
Or maybe the train?

1627
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,832
They'd make us walk.

1628
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,554
Darling, please don't
come to the station tomorrow.

1629
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,831
Last time, my mother went with me
the train was late leaving

1630
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,791
and there was this nervous, weeping woman

1631
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,990
saying the same things over and over.

1632
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,156
Not my mother as she really is at all.

1633
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,396
No, we shouldn't do that to each other.

1634
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,079
- ls this seat vacant?
- Sure.

1635
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:47,955
Maxl, say goodbye to your daddy.

1636
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,908
The child, must be tired.
Go along, Elsa.

1637
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,951
He can wait.

1638
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,991
(Man) I wish you had stayed home.

1639
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,395
(Train whistle blows)

1640
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,829
(Train whistles)

1641
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,436
(Train whistles...)

1642
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,949
(...Screeching of falling bombs)

1643
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,716
Fourth Company!

1644
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,349
Graeber!

1645
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,879
Over here!

1646
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,718
Immerman!

1647
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:43,195
(Laughs)

1648
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,471
Well, if it isn't the furlough boy!

1649
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,830
- Sauer!
- Yes?

1650
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,428
You crazy fool, why didn't you stay home?

1651
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,199
The rate we're running
you could have waited for us to join you.

1652
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,231
What brought you back to this muck?

1653
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,679
(Explosion)

1654
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,119
How did you find us?

1655
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:59,912
Came up with an engineer outfit.

1656
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,110
Been looking for you guys for two weeks.

1657
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,673
(Shrill whistle)

1658
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,958
Oh, relax.

1659
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,071
Sling that rifle back on your shoulder,

1660
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,350
we haven't had anything
to shoot at for days.

1661
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,198
They keep pounding us with artillery,

1662
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,311
when they run out of shells, we rest.

1663
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,590
And pretty soon they've got more shells.

1664
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:27,914
- Sauer!
- Yes, sir.

1665
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,678
Get those men out of there!

1666
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,711
Move out of there.

1667
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,751
What are you doing?

1668
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,279
Graeber!

1669
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,631
I don't know how you got here,
but I'm glad.

1670
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,193
How was it at home?

1671
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,759
I know.

1672
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:50,032
Come on.

1673
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,276
Come on, keep moving.

1674
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,672
Come on. Relax, boy.
They're just looking for us.

1675
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,199
They haven't found us yet.

1676
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,993
(Sneezes)

1677
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,315
Sauer, I think I'm catching cold.

1678
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,829
Don't worry, your insurance is paid up.

1679
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,476
Yeah, but my wife's too stupid.

1680
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,716
She wouldn't know how to collect it.

1681
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:31,359
Hey, Sauer, look!
Beer!

1682
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,789
- I'll get it.
- No, no. I'll get it.

1683
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,999
(Chuckling)

1684
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,396
Hey, this must have been a brewery!

1685
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,431
(Explosion)

1686
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:59,668
Keep moving! Sauer, Graeber, move...

1687
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,438
Sir.

1688
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,152
(Whispers) Keep moving.

1689
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,713
Keep moving!

1690
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,438
Sauer! Keep moving!

1691
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,312
Go on!

1692
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:33,115
Stay here and rest.

1693
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,798
Break rank.

1694
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,990
Mail!

1695
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,597
Mail!

1696
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,799
Emmerich.

1697
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,638
Dead.

1698
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,352
Zender. Dead.

1699
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,833
Dead.

1700
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,676
Immerman.

1701
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,189
Smith.

1702
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,596
Graeber.

1703
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,472
From my wife!

1704
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,358
Keep moving.

1705
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,710
Pick up your feet.

1706
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:42,389
We found them hiding in a cellar, sir.
I'm sure they are guerrillas.

1707
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,991
- Did you find any weapons?
- No, sir.

1708
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,395
Then how can you be sure?

1709
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,677
We'll hold them until we can
turn them over for questioning.

1710
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,631
But where?

1711
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,832
The grain storehouse by the lake has
an outside bolt on it, sir.

1712
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,916
All right. Take them and...

1713
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,992
Graeber.

1714
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,269
Yes, sir.

1715
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,072
Take charge of these prisoners.

1716
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,077
They are to be locked up and guarded.

1717
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,952
- Lamas.
- Yes, sir.

1718
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:18,274
You'll show him where.

1719
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,038
Krüger.

1720
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,870
Nothing for you, sir.

1721
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,389
There's nobody to write.

1722
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:32,758
You should have gotten to us yesterday,
you'd have a lot less to carry back.

1723
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,794
Why don't you get yourself some rest?

1724
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,150
Fine. I could use it.

1725
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:18,153
(Elisabeth) 'I'm writing this sitting under
the bombed tree by the river.

1726
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:21,716
'It's growing and living again as though
it had never been scarred.

1727
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:25,116
'You told me we must be like that too,
and we are.

1728
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,073
'We're going to have a child, Ernst.

1729
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,359
'And the thought of our child
shuts out all else.

1730
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:35,913
'Except you.

1731
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:39,191
'Frau Witte says it doesn't matter to her
what we call the baby

1732
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,595
'as long as it's a girl!

1733
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:44,393
'I will now write to your parents
offering them a vote too.

1734
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,875
'You sent the address
just in time, so I...'

1735
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,433
Graeber!

1736
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,109
Graeber! Get back to the platoon.
We're pulling out.

1737
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,878
Where are you going?

1738
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,877
We're not gonna hold them with us.

1739
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,355
Get going, I'll finish them off.

1740
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,152
I'm responsible for them.

1741
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:02,396
All right, then you do it.

1742
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,476
I'll let you have the honour.

1743
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,158
It's no honour.

1744
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,674
- But it is an order.
- To me it isn't.

1745
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,597
Do you know who you are talking to?

1746
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,230
I know exactly who I'm talking to.

1747
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,599
(Gun shot)

1748
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,672
Go!

1749
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,358
You're free!

1750
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,517
Well, go!

1751
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,069
German beast!
