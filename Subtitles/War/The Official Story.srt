<i>Hear, ye mortals, the sacred cry:</i>

4
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:59,542
<i>Freedom, freedom, freedom</i>

5
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:06,552
<i>Hear the sounds of broken chains</i>

6
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:11,789
<i>See noble equality enthroned</i>

7
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:21,197
<i>Their dignified throne was unveiled</i>

8
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:28,508
By the United Provinces of the South

9
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:34,676
<i>And the world's free men answer:</i>

10
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:43,518
<i>Here's to the great Argentine people</i>

11
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,929
I'm Alicia Marnet Ibañez.
Some of you already know me.

12
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,799
Our subject is Argentine History.

13
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,303
We will be examining...

14
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:11,450
the social and political
institutions since 1810.

15
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,043
We'll have three hours per week...

16
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,020
which isn't much.

17
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,989
And here are 3 warnings:

18
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,324
I don't like to waste time.

19
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,919
I believe in discipline.

20
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,995
I don't give away high grades.

21
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:30,962
Some of you remember that.

22
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:38,744
By understanding history we
learn to understand the world.

23
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,615
No peoples can survive
without memory.

24
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:47,952
History is the memory
of the peoples.

25
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,050
That's how we shall
study our subject.

26
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,468
I don't see him.

27
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:31,955
Here Ma'am.

28
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:33,565
Sissy!

29
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,029
Gentlemen, please!

30
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,502
Use the towel.

31
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,802
I can put my head
underwater, look.

32
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,409
No, Don't do that!

33
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,507
You'll get water in your ears.

34
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:52,942
I'll make myself a foam suit.
Do you bathe naked too, mommy?

35
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,713
Rinse off Gaby, or we'll
never get finished.

36
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,055
Sing, so I know you haven't drowned.

37
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,686
All right!

38
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:07,032
In the land of
I-don't-remember...

39
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:14,096
I take three steps and I'm lost

40
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:20,743
One step this way.
I wonder if I may.

41
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:31,422
One step over there.
Oh, what a big scare.

42
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:46,998
I'm sorry Ma'am.

43
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:48,765
The train broke down again.

44
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,634
- How's your sister?
- Fine.

45
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,006
How are you Gaby?

46
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,911
I'm fine. Mommy cooked my meat.

47
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,143
Is it tastier than when I cook it?

48
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,716
Ma'am, Mrs. Luisa called
to remind you about...

49
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,049
your high school reunion.

50
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:10,985
Cross out Rodrigo. Did you?

51
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,622
No, because he might make
friends again with Dolores.

52
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:20,899
No, he's already got a new girlfriend.

53
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,506
Dolores is lucky to have such
a devoted friend as you.

54
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,239
What does "divided" mean?

55
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,887
<i>It is too bad that some</i>
<i>news media abuse their rights.</i>

56
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:41,152
By preaching destabilization,
they encourage subversive ideas.

57
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,087
You're still there?

58
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,789
Don't you have to dress?

59
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:50,235
<i>The army is preparing to</i>
<i>confront the infiltrators.</i>

60
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:52,629
A kiss?

61
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,696
You did buy it?

62
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,769
It's beautiful! Gaby will love it.

63
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,539
It seems real! Touch it!

64
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:02,975
True.

65
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,654
Daddy, daddy.

66
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,723
What are you doing here?

67
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,257
Off to bed.

68
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,936
It was quite a scare!

69
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,214
My wife's afraid I'll get
a heart attack.

70
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,888
With these things you can't
neglect the smallest detail.

71
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,551
If you neglect your details,
it's your problem, Macci.

72
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,987
I did as I was told.

73
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,254
By whom?

74
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,894
Come on, Doctor! By you!

75
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:56,125
Ibañez and Dante
set it all up with my men.

76
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,667
We advise you, Macci.
We're just advisors.

77
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,630
- We didn't expect you.
- Forgive me.

78
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,309
- What about Elvira?
- She's home being punished.

79
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,169
Why's my friend being punished?
Or is it a military secret?

80
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,882
At home, she's in charge.
It's liver trouble.

81
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,577
- Hello, Ibañez.
- Hello, General.

82
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,048
Miller, you lost your wife so early?

83
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,588
My maid had cousins in Malvinas.

84
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,197
She wasn't even told
if they're dead or alive.

85
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,363
We lost the war a year ago!

86
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,332
A battle was lost, not the war.

87
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,196
Don't tell me they plan to continue!

88
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,874
I was in Spain last week with
Ballesteros, a businessman...

89
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,705
and a lifelong socialist.
Guess what he said?

90
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,077
"We were better off against Franco."

91
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,946
Now that they're the government...

92
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,620
they don't know whom to blame.

93
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,914
It's useless! I've been
telling him for25 years that...

94
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:56,083
talking business while eating is
bad manners and hurts digestion.

95
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,853
Who's talking business?

96
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,088
Politics, then. That's even worse.

97
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,000
We woman should be guiding
the conversation.

98
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,830
Regina, tell us about your child.
Is he really so big?

99
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,233
Yes, he's fine.

100
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,200
He weighed 9 pounds at birth!

101
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,105
Unbelievable, considering them.
It must be the racial mixture!

102
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,173
Miller, whom do you suspect?

103
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:25,122
Oh no! My mother was...
very tall. Therefore...

104
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:36,199
Roberto, were you also present
at your daughter’s birth?

105
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,065
No, I'm like your husband.
We're from another generation.

106
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,340
I think it's Alicia who...

107
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:49,273
belongs to another generation.
You're not very modern, are you?

108
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,214
No, I'm not very modern.

109
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,982
That child must be four
or five now, isn't she?

110
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,782
She'll be five soon.

111
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:12,429
You two are really quite different,
aren't you, Roberto?

112
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:14,939
Maybe that's the secret!

113
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,740
Yes, I imagine it must be somewhere!

114
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:26,381
It's mutual. I think she's unbearable.

115
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,447
And she thinks you deserve
better than a barren woman.

116
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,017
You think Andrada never told her?
She knows!

117
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:36,456
She pretended to be interested
in the kid of an American.

118
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:40,060
"Roberto, were you also
present at the birth?"

119
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,734
Oh, Alicia, you're making a
fuss over nothing.

120
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,803
She doesn't care if we got Gaby
from the stork or the gypsies.

121
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:49,304
She doesn't care!
But she knows I do!

122
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,271
She's just like her husband.

123
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,270
He always seems to imply...

124
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,880
that anyone who disagrees
with him is out!

125
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:03,147
And since she can only fire the maid,
she wrings our guts.

126
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:09,491
Did you notice? She called the
Yank a cuckold, Regina a bitch...

127
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,229
you a poor soul, the husband rude,
me an idiot, all in one phrase.

128
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,491
She attacks everyone except
the General.

129
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,733
She does have her limits,
we must admit.

130
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:25,875
"The gaucho Moreira opens the door
ready for his last fight.

131
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,946
The officer and his soldiers...

132
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,514
defend themselves against
his violent onslaught.

133
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:37,013
But, repelled by his brutal charge...

134
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:43,758
they retreat until they
get lost in the corridors...

135
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,156
right and left of the rear stage.

136
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:52,532
Sergeant Chirino, terrified
hides behind the well.

137
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:58,541
Moreira, thinking he's alone,
plans to escape over the fence.

138
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:03,540
Seeing him climb the fence,
the sergeant uses his weapon.

139
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:09,050
Feeling the chill of the
bayonet in his back, Moreira..."

140
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:13,291
Well done, Chirino!

141
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:17,987
No! Just a moment! "Moreira fires
his pistol at the sergeant."

142
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,161
No, sir, No!

143
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,866
Yes! He's only a cop!

144
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,437
"Moreira is badly hurt!

145
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,205
Vincenta appears left front stage."
Who plays Vincenta?

146
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,846
Cullen! Come on Cullen!

147
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,950
Cullen is a faggot! Cullen's a faggot.

148
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,590
"Make way, cowards!"

149
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,895
- You brute!
- Cowards

150
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,163
"Seeing him, she flings herself
on him, overcome by grief."

151
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:05,067
"A dist ant voice, announcing
his death, sings these verses:

152
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,845
"I'm staking all my luck...

153
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:13,841
on my lasso, because a love
that is born Creole...

154
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,981
is not repelled by death."

155
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:20,483
Because a weather-beaten
and sturdy gaucho...

156
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:29,923
Because a weather-beaten
and sturdy gaucho...

157
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,174
Good morning.

158
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:05,968
Good morning, gentlemen.

159
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,096
Good morning, Professor.

160
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,675
You know Macarena's mother
can't leave kindergarten.

161
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:22,075
She says she has to stay there all day.

162
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,057
Today, she wanted to leave
and Maqui wouldn't let her.

163
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,255
She grabbed her legs
and cried and cried...

164
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,955
I'd never miss our reunion!

165
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,628
You're never late! How are you?

166
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,194
Just this year,
when I have to leave early!

167
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,371
You look lovely! A beautiful dress!
Doesn't she look great?

168
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,072
The latest style. You are really thin!

169
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,939
Me, thin? I started dieting
half an hour ago.

170
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,239
Your hair’s still long. How
old-fashioned!

171
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:53,149
You'll never guess who
sends you regards.

172
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,324
Anna!

173
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,254
I met her at the supermarket.

174
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:39,261
She looks like our... grandmother.

175
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:43,661
Her skin’s very fair and such
thin skin wrinkles early.

176
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,203
Being fair and thin-skinned isn't
the problem. She's been through a lot.

177
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,130
Her son was sent to the Malvinas war.

178
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,206
Her last remaining son.

179
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,399
Where are the others?

180
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,145
The eldest married and left.

181
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,477
All her children became subversives.

182
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,149
It's how she raised them.

183
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,446
How do we know
they were subversives?

184
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:06,022
If they were seized,
surely there was a reason!

185
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,192
- What are you talking about?
- Let's change the subject.

186
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,464
Anna, how's your son?
He must be all grown up.

187
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,226
He was 17 in February.

188
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,570
My God, Anna, you're old!

189
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,505
Clara and I were pregnant
at the same time.

190
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,573
They called us
the "captive globes".

191
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,243
Doesn't Clara ever come?

192
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:34,579
She went to Caracas 5 years ago.
Wasn't that when you left?

193
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:35,720
I left 7 years ago.

194
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,481
7? Really?

195
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,184
In 1976, shortly after the
military coup.

196
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,062
You're back for good?

197
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,138
I don't know yet.

198
00:17:56,642 --> 00:18:00,510
We can't all choose between the
tough caviar of exile and home

199
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,544
Don't expect us to pity you.

200
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,145
I thought about you, all these years.

201
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,749
- Really?
- I swear.

202
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,211
You were like an obsession.

203
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,385
And when I saw you,
it all came back to me.

204
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:17,390
Because you look the same.
Exactly the same.

205
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,565
Many years have passed.
Many things have happened...

206
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,233
and you look the same.

207
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,602
The same as the one who
brown-nosed the monitor and...

208
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,773
who gave me 2 silver saltcellars
when all I owned was a mattress.

209
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,505
So that now, Dora...

210
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,111
contemptible schoolmate...

211
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,380
unforgettable bitch...

212
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,377
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

213
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:51,552
Why do you live in such a
faraway country? Do you have kids?

214
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,798
One, but he's big.
He no longer likes stories.

215
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,695
My daughter's hair is ugly,
like a broom.

216
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,166
Will it grow if I cut it?

217
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,607
Time for bed, Gaby.

218
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,307
Just a little longer.
One more story.

219
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,445
The one about the invisible paint.

220
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,483
The paint makes things invisible.

221
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,760
For instance, we paint
your bed and it vanishes.

222
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,820
Then mommy will think
you're sleeping in mid-air.

223
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:30,296
Mommy, is she like Dolores?
Is she your "divided friend"?

224
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,165
The school building was awful!
Clara called it "the jail".

225
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,212
Like where you're
teaching now, right?

226
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,483
No, Roberto. Please, no.

227
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,852
It was built around the same time.
Bars on the windows.

228
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,850
That's true. I hadn't realized it.

229
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,310
Gaby is wonderful.

230
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,241
She says I'm the "divided" friend.

231
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,245
She can't pronounce devoted.

232
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,420
She loves the word
and uses it constantly.

233
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,494
Will you be staying?

234
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,227
I don't know yet.

235
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:38,628
You're looking good.

236
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,038
I never saw you in a skirt before.

237
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,313
Europe was good for you, wasn't it?

238
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,283
It seems to have
polished up your edges.

239
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,653
Here I am in Caracas...

240
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,525
18 pounds over the limit
allotted to romantic victims.

241
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,991
And with 3 teenage daughters
who realize that...

242
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:13,938
between them and freedom
looms their mother, the idiot...

243
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:19,673
starving myself and running
3 miles a day...

244
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,073
around my single bed!

245
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:26,813
Aware of being an agile fat tie
without a man in sight.

246
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:43,565
Forty years old! How did it happen?

247
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:51,340
How did I get here without realizing?

248
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,384
The fat tie!

249
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,645
Well, we're all right!

250
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,082
At the fatties we used to drink
eggnog.

251
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:21,068
I got sick. Did I tell you?
No, I didn't.

252
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,107
The day I turned 40, Roberto
took me to a fancy restaurant.

253
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:29,341
Very expensive. And I...

254
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,784
I got intoxicated!

255
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,519
I spent 3 days in bed!

256
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:43,685
3 days in bed! The doctor came.
I'd never been so ill.

257
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:46,525
You're okay with Roberto?

258
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:47,697
Yes.

259
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:57,038
Then everything's fine.
It's nice to come back to that.

260
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,704
Why didn't you tell me
you were leaving?

261
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,848
You never wrote.

262
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,617
I had no time to
organize going-away parties.

263
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,077
Why were you in a hurry?

264
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,923
Should we get drunk on eggnog?

265
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:14,481
Disgusting!

266
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:17,056
Why won't you tell me?

267
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,506
Did you know my apartment
on Laprida Street?

268
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,875
No. Not that one.

269
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,945
There was a gardel poster
on the door.

270
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,131
They ripped it to shreds.

271
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:07,568
They stormed in, threw
a sweater over my head...

272
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,178
and destroyed everything.

273
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:18,755
They took me in a car
with their feet on me.

274
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,853
I was hit with a rifle butt.

275
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:27,158
I awoke naked on a table.
They began torturing me.

276
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:33,870
At some point someone
examined me with a stethoscope.

277
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,868
He told them to stop.

278
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,777
I'm not sure if it was that day.

279
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,286
I lost almost all sense of time.

280
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:55,191
I felt something inside me was broken.

281
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,527
I don't know if it can be fix ed.

282
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,167
I still wake up feeling
I'm being drowned.

283
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:11,805
I hang there and they shove
my head into a pail of water.

284
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,874
After7 years I'm still drowning.

285
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,614
When I got out of there...

286
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,988
They said I'd been there for36 days.

287
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:32,223
I had lost 27 pounds and
I'd undergone all their treatment.

288
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:38,936
At first...

289
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,568
I was spared being raped.

290
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:46,935
You know why?

291
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:53,778
Because one guy, the only
one whose face I saw...

292
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,253
he smiled and said...

293
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,715
"I'm going to keep you for my self."

294
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:08,093
Then, I always heard his voice
when he came by...

295
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,365
to ask if they'd kept me for him.

296
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:19,300
I'm still terrified I'll hear his voice
on the street, in the subway.

297
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,047
But why? Why did they do that to you?

298
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,379
Why?

299
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,949
At first they asked about Pedro.

300
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,393
I told them the truth.
I hadn't seen him in 2 years.

301
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,627
And they asked again.

302
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:45,068
And I told them again,
"Not in 2 years".

303
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,394
And again they asked.

304
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:54,602
Again I told them, and I got
electric prodding and drowning.

305
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,334
What had Pedro done?

306
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,868
Pedro was very involved.

307
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:28,744
Maybe he was already dead
when they questioned me.

308
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,443
Did you report it?

309
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:40,146
What a good idea!
It hadn't occurred to me!

310
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,351
To whom would I have reported it?

311
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,357
If you hadn't done anything.

312
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,030
What do you mean "to whom"?

313
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,134
That place was so full.

314
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:01,840
Oft en I didn't know if the cries
were mine or someone else's.

315
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:07,250
There were pregnant women who
lost their babies there.

316
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:11,489
And others were taken away,
but they returned alone.

317
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:16,288
Their babies went to families who
buy them without asking questions.

318
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,858
Why tell me that?

319
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,411
I never told anyone.

320
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,515
I wrote about it once for a commission.

321
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,002
How unbelievable!

322
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,310
I feel guilty.

323
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,063
Gaby.

324
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,160
You scared me!

325
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,163
To bed. Let's go.

326
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:21,848
Many of Moreno's writings
exemplify his republican spirit.

327
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,986
For instance, his decree for
suppressing honors, which he...

328
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:31,223
issued after December fifth
when a seemingly drunk officer...

329
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:36,364
whose name I don't remember.

330
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,257
Never mind. Continue.

331
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:44,307
This officer... The t ext book
only says that he...

332
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,944
"excessively praised Saavedra."

333
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:51,004
I think he called him
"Emperor" or something.

334
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,210
Anyhow, he gave him titles
that weren't democratic.

335
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:57,955
What does it say about honors?

336
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:01,989
They were suspended.

337
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:06,525
Of course. Do you remember
Moreno's words?

338
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,624
- Does anyone remember?
- I do, Ma'am.

339
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:18,532
He said the only distinctions
among Junta members are...

340
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,011
those based on where
they happen to sit.

341
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:25,880
He also says, in that document,
"no inhabitant of Buenos Aires...

342
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,914
drunk or asleep, may speak
against his country's liberties."

343
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,247
Very good, Duran.

344
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,524
Does anyone remember
other writings...

345
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,589
by Moreno, illustrating
his republican feelings?

346
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:41,265
I do!

347
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:43,899
Well... I do.

348
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:52,004
There was an article by him
about freedom of the press.

349
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,210
Your name?

350
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:54,610
Fercovich.

351
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,545
Why don't you stand up
and tell us about it?

352
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,550
Oh, I don't really know.

353
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,684
I don't know anything by heart.

354
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,421
My old man says if I
studied things by heart...

355
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,555
I'd never learn anything.

356
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:14,460
Tell us in your own words.

357
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:21,161
It's something like this: If
publishing the truth is forbidden...

358
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,708
lies and poverty will triumph...

359
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:31,511
and ignorance. They
didn't kill him for nothing.

360
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:32,516
Whom?

361
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,343
Moreno. They didn't chuck him
in the water for nothing.

362
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:40,324
It wasn't for nothing.

363
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,993
They used to throw people overboard
if they died on the high seas.

364
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:48,495
They had no way to preserve
corpses on long sea voyages.

365
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,331
But Moreno was poisoned.

366
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:58,475
It's a theory...

367
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:02,679
Some people believe it.
But there's no proof.

368
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,139
There's no proof because
history's written by assassins!

369
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:15,616
I'm Horatio Costa.

370
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:19,223
Mr. Costa, please step outside.

371
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,632
This is a history class, not a debate.

372
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:36,445
Whoever wishes to talk, raises
their hand for permission.

373
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:39,406
Without discipline there's no
teaching and no learning.

374
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,190
Are you a phony magician
or a real one?

375
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:47,551
A real magician.

376
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:50,185
Can't you see?
He's a real magician.

377
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:54,089
Any more cokes, Rosa?

378
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,388
The fridge is bursting!

379
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:58,801
And so am I!

380
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,165
If your mother-in-law doesn't
leave the kitchen, I'll quit!

381
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:04,670
You'll quit?

382
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,704
Who's going to swallow your cooking?

383
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,813
Alicia, are there more cokes?

384
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,318
I bet my wise-guy brother
won't show up until it's over!

385
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,258
He's meeting with some
out-of-town people.

386
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,268
Too bad you couldn't
convince your father.

387
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:34,733
Pop is stubborn. He won't
give in if Roberto doesn't.

388
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,367
Tell him Pop's dying to see Gaby.

389
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,875
Or does he meet out-of-town
people on Sundays, too?

390
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,239
I think of Gaby's mother,
I'm afraid.

391
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:44,605
Afraid? Why?

392
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:45,606
I quit!

393
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,180
Say yes, Alicia, before
she changes her mind.

394
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,654
Now, like we did with the balloon?

395
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:58,589
Yes or no?

396
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,527
It happens to be your
daughter's birthday!

397
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:14,564
Nothing.

398
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:15,929
It's fine.

399
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,167
Everything's fine.

400
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,482
My baby, are you sad?
Don't cry, my baby.

401
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:39,187
Let's go to bed.
You'll go to sleep. Won't you?

402
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:44,423
Sleep well. You want
your mommy to stay? Fine.

403
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,570
Don't cry any more.
Your mommy’s here. See?

404
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:53,835
All right, my little one.
It's all right.

405
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,739
My little one is sleepy.

406
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,748
Why is my little one sleepy?

407
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:11,886
Because the sandman is here.

408
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,426
Look at those toys
your cousins brought you.

409
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,242
What happened, my love?

410
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:31,680
Did you hurt her?

411
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,442
What'd I tell you?

412
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,246
We didn't do anything to her.

413
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:38,921
We didn't bother her.

414
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:40,613
Remember our talk?

415
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,759
She got scared.
We didn't see her.

416
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:51,634
Can't she play, even though
she's small?

417
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:10,984
I can't believe it's been five years.

418
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:16,860
That day you came home
very late. Remember? Like today.

419
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:20,925
You didn't know how to hold her.

420
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,592
You carried her like a doggie.

421
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:31,375
At the time...

422
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,736
I agreed not to go to the hospital.

423
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:41,511
Now I think I should have.
I should have gone there.

424
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,820
Who was that woman in the car?

425
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,397
Who was she?

426
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:54,558
A nurse.

427
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,036
Was the doctor's name
Jaifel? Jeifel?

428
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,698
I forgot.
How should I remember?

429
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,135
He gave you Gaby, and
you forgot his name?

430
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,977
We agreed we'd never
talk about it.

431
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:17,721
Did you pay?

432
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:19,879
Alicia.

433
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,119
My mother or the doctor?

434
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,456
Why bring this up now?

435
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,429
Because you said she agreed.
How do you know she agreed?

436
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:32,602
You saw her in the hospital?

437
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,041
Answer me, Roberto.

438
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,601
Don't be angry.

439
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:46,373
Maybe she didn't even know
her child was being taken away.

440
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,511
What is it you're asking?

441
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,524
What the hell are you asking me?

442
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,058
How do I know what I'm asking.
I don't know.

443
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,056
I always feel badly
on this particular day.

444
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,038
Won't we ever tell her the truth?

445
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,937
You realize, we celebrate our day,
not hers.

446
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,776
We celebrate the day
you brought her home.

447
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,550
We celebrate the day we inscribed her.

448
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,485
That's her birthday.

449
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,189
"Because they were
conceived without freedom...

450
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:34,222
the absurdities of our fathers,
ingrained by time and custom...

451
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,691
will continue to be respect ed.

452
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:43,234
Let us for once, not follow
our outdated opinions.

453
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,504
By not being selfish,
may we know the truth."

454
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:51,145
Wait, idiot, let's see how
it ends. Listen, Horacio!

455
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:55,244
"Truth, like virtue, contains
its own rewards.

456
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:58,816
Discussing and revealing it,
bring out it s shining splendor."

457
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,785
Look, dummy, he writes:
"If restrictions are imp...

458
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,765
If restrictions are imposed on
speech, the soul will vegetate...

459
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,127
like matter..."

460
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:16,062
Sit down!

461
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:21,537
"And the lies, the worries,
the bigotry and ignorance..."

462
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:23,577
Take that away!

463
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,245
I won't ask who did it, because...

464
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,586
you all saw it.

465
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:32,717
"And ignorance..."

466
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:34,718
So...

467
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,725
You'll all pay for those
who play such pranks.

468
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,294
"Provoking division among people
and causing...

469
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,826
their continued abasement,
misery and ruin."

470
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:45,126
You'll know better next time.

471
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:48,298
"Mariano Moreno, Le Gaceta,
Buenos Aires, June 12, 1810."

472
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,936
What if you were
to be late somewhere?

473
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:56,505
Why?

474
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,005
To have coffee with me, for instance.

475
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:03,652
I'm sorry, Benitez, I'm in
a hurry. I'm due downtown.

476
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:07,090
Take me along?
I'd like to talk with your.

477
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:16,993
How about that coffee?

478
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:20,533
Not now, Benitez.
What do you want?

479
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,205
A little flirting, perhaps?

480
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:25,330
Are you crazy?

481
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,111
What a temper! If I had...

482
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,779
asked you to bed,
what a row you'd make!

483
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:31,941
What?

484
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,348
No, it's nothing like that.
Don't have any illusions.

485
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,917
I'm returning a report...

486
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,914
you left in the principal's office.

487
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:42,689
It's about a pupil, Costa...

488
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,055
who talks nonsense in class.

489
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:47,956
Why've you got it?

490
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:50,198
The secretary's my friend.

491
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:51,664
How dare you?

492
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,331
What right do you have?

493
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,136
No right. Let's be quite clear.

494
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,231
I took the file because
I know the score.

495
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:04,170
Because his feelings could cost
that idiot more than you know.

496
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,784
Because you, too
deserve another chance.

497
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,691
The whole class is
completely insolent.

498
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:22,027
Today they covered the
blackboard with news clippings.

499
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:26,859
Frankly, I don't know
what they want. Here.

500
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,099
They want you to be informed.

501
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:37,010
Why did Cuyo University fire you?

502
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,248
Because I'm dangerous.

503
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,852
I wasn't fired.

504
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:48,422
They visited me in my absence,
and shredded every paper I had.

505
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:53,185
I got the message... all by myself.

506
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,632
And these lists...

507
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,262
with all the missing people,
even babies, is that...

508
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:03,967
true?

509
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:10,180
I mean they could be like
you: In new jobs.

510
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,340
Somewhere else. Right?

511
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:17,117
What do you care whether it's true.

512
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,346
Is it your problem?

513
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,656
<i>It will end. It will end.</i>
<i>This habit of killing.</i>

514
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,324
<i>It will end. It will end.</i>

515
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:32,425
It's always easier to believe
it's impossible, right?

516
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:37,066
Because if it were possible
it would require complicity.

517
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:40,740
Many people can't believe it,
even if they see it.

518
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,942
Take Costa's report, in case
you want to submit it again.

519
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:53,218
FAMILIES OF THOSE MISSING
FOR POLITICAL REASONS

520
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,891
<i>The missing ones.</i>
<i>Let them tell us where they are.</i>

521
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:08,905
<i>Let them tell us where</i>
<i>those kidnapped babies are!</i>

522
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:27,356
<i>You ill-begotten military men...</i>

523
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:30,950
<i>what have you done</i>
<i>with our missing ones?</i>

524
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,829
<i>The foreign debt</i>
<i>and the corruption...</i>

525
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:37,994
<i>are the worst shit</i>
<i>our nation has had!</i>

526
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:41,437
<i>And what about Malvinas?</i>

527
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:45,798
<i>Those boys who never came back!</i>

528
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,375
<i>We must not forget them.</i>

529
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:52,475
<i>That's why we must fight.</i>

530
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,264
RETURN ALL CHILDREN
BORN IN CAPTIVITY

531
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:15,995
TO THE LEGITIMATE FAMILIES
The grandmothers of the Plaza

532
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,310
- Dante, please.
- Just a minute, Macci.

533
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,809
Tell Ibañez it's ready, and
there are 5 more.

534
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,219
I can't, now.

535
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:07,346
I think your figures are wrong.

536
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,323
Get that old man out,
or Andrada will kill us!

537
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,826
Why don't you do it?

538
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:18,224
We've too much work today!

539
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:21,231
I didn't know you're here!
Wait for me inside.

540
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:24,200
No. Better make an
appointment for tomorrow.

541
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:25,598
What's wrong?

542
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:27,475
I want ed to talk to you.

543
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:29,846
Remember? I'm leaving.
We should go now.

544
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:32,446
I can't wait longer,
and you know it!

545
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:36,314
I must see Andrada.
I won't go to jail!

546
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,581
Why would you go to jail?
What's wrong with you?

547
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:42,855
Criminals go to jail.

548
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:46,128
It's a civilized country.
And you have friends.

549
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,854
Let's see if Andrada can see you.

550
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:51,326
What a fuss over a silly
summons by a judge!

551
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:52,993
Come along to the airport?

552
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:55,461
What's wrong?

553
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:56,662
Nothing.

554
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,368
I'll handle it. Don't miss
the plane. Call someone.

555
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,203
Whom?

556
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:05,877
Do we have the tickets?

557
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,305
You've been married
for years, haven't you?

558
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:41,943
And you still come to see
him off. Congratulations!

559
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:45,444
You're a professor, aren't you?

560
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,188
I teach history.

561
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:52,254
It can't be easy teaching
history in high school.

562
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:55,322
The kids aren't as they used to be...

563
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,200
What do you think of today's youth?

564
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:00,703
Is there any hope?

565
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:03,332
My nephew...

566
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,732
he's 16 years old
and doesn't believe...

567
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:08,472
that San Martin crossed the Andes.

568
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:27,255
I know it's silly, but don't
leave. I'm afraid to be alone.

569
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:31,099
It's not the first time!
What's wrong?

570
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:31,960
Not now.

571
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,366
When you come back we'll talk.

572
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:35,465
Mr. Ibañez!

573
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:40,132
I'd like to travel with you.
Even to Bolivia.

574
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:43,774
When we return, let's take a trip.
We haven't traveled in ages.

575
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,315
Take care of Gaby. How was she?

576
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,119
Grumbling, because you're going away.

577
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:52,983
Just like her mother!

578
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,988
Like her mother?
Who knows what she'll be like!

579
00:49:57,594 --> 00:50:00,324
There you go again!
That's it, isn't it?

580
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:02,463
We'll miss the plane!

581
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:03,393
I must go!

582
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,262
Stop thinking about it.
It's pointless. Stop thinking!

583
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:25,287
Mommy, I've a letter in my notebook.
It says you should...

584
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:29,615
buy me pencils, crayons and
an eraser. But no sharpener...

585
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,754
because in a week they'd be...

586
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,260
this tiny so you couldn't hold them

587
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:37,657
Must I chase you all over?

588
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,365
Are you sick? Are you going to die?

589
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,699
Come on. You have to finish dinner.

590
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:46,064
When is Daddy coming?

591
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:47,573
In a week.

592
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:48,710
Like this?

593
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,146
Like this. The other hand.
The whole hand.

594
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,115
Day after, after, after tomorrow.

595
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,219
Gaby, let go of my face. Go and eat.

596
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:00,455
Come on. Let's go eat.

597
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:07,858
Eat! It's late.

598
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:11,565
This meat has fat. I won't eat it.

599
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:13,433
I cut off the fat.

600
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:36,588
BIRTH CERTIFICATE

601
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,892
How do they get meat from the cows?

602
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,432
- First they kill them.
- Do they shoot them?

603
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,598
Gaby, eat now.

604
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:48,304
I get tired of chewing so much.

605
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:40,440
DELIVERY ROOM

606
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:50,509
Dr. Jaifer. Spelled with
an "r" at the end.

607
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:53,386
He's been gone 3 years.

608
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:56,587
3 years? Do you know
where he is now?

609
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:58,894
No, I wouldn't know.

610
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:03,396
They might know more
at the administration office.

611
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,462
Are you all right?

612
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:15,601
I was Gaby's age. I sat on
Grandma's rocking chair...

613
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:18,846
And couldn't understand
what took them so long.

614
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:24,083
They were both killed
in a car accident

615
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:30,414
Poor Grandma.
She told me about a trip.

616
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:33,693
She invented letters.

617
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:40,057
For years I wait ed for them,
sitting there...

618
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:42,865
in that rocking chair.

619
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:47,401
I thought...

620
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,541
that Daddy and Mommy
had abandoned me.

621
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:58,814
Not until I grew up
and saw their grave...

622
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:02,587
did I start to forgive them.

623
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,827
I always believed what
anyone told me.

624
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:14,470
But now I can't.

625
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,738
I don't know who Gaby is.

626
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:24,107
Nothing seems true.

627
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:29,145
We didn't plan to tell
her she’s adopted.

628
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,584
Sometimes she asks about
her grandparents...

629
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,623
and about their grandparents.
As far back as God.

630
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:46,161
She says that God is "bionic".

631
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:54,067
Because He can see us
while we can't see him.

632
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:56,469
And it's true.

633
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:03,517
I always thought...

634
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,013
that her mother didn't want her.

635
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:10,015
But, now...

636
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,930
I never, before, took
anything from anyone.

637
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,630
God entrusted her to you,
Alicia. That is His will.

638
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:25,063
Why do you doubt
His infinite wisdom?

639
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:28,203
Do not offend the Lord.

640
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:32,747
Do not reject what was given to you.

641
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,984
I don't reject her!

642
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:38,985
You've shown piety and compassion.

643
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:44,058
You've protected her from evil
and the dangers she'd have faced.

644
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:45,520
What dangers?

645
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:48,888
You know the truth, Father!
Won't you tell me?

646
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,762
You have not sinned...

647
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:55,771
but your covenant with the
Lord has been damaged.

648
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:57,702
You can help me, Father.

649
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:00,175
He told us, "I shall not
destroy the cities..."

650
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,977
for the sake of righteous men."

651
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:09,277
Father, you know how it all
happened. Right?

652
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:15,682
Tell me the truth, Father!
You know it.

653
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,855
You have to tell me the truth!

654
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:24,529
You were with Roberto that
day weren't you, Father?

655
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,934
I absolve you of your sins.

656
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:30,868
I don't need absolution!
I need the truth!

657
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:39,144
Thank the Lord because
He is good.

658
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,075
His mercy is eternal.

659
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,820
The Lord has forgiven your sins.

660
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:50,851
Go in peace.

661
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:33,366
Alicia, Rosa took her home.
Gaby had a little fever.

662
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:36,296
You may dress her now.

663
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:39,199
No! I can dress myself!

664
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:43,670
Of course you can, young lady!

665
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:46,615
I thought I was talking
to a little girl.

666
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:51,753
What does this say, Doctor?

667
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:57,159
"Ortolani sign." The luxation
of the hip she was born with.

668
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,323
You remember we spoke about it?

669
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:01,821
Bring her here when she's really ill.

670
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:04,257
You waste your money on me.

671
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:09,061
You told me it was likely
that she was...

672
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:15,141
a first child, because
of this Ortolani sign. Right?

673
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:17,143
Yes. It could be.

674
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:24,112
And that the date of birth
could be determined...

675
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,049
by when the umbilical cord fell off.

676
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:38,191
I mean, these facts are
registered at birth.

677
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:43,136
The weight, height, all that,
are also at the hospital. Right?

678
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:42,194
Marcelo almost smuggled me
into this job. Don't bug me!

679
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,292
Will Roberto be returning on Saturday?

680
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:49,770
You didn't come here
to discuss your husband?

681
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,166
Gaby is adopted.

682
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,866
Remember? You spoke of
children that were given...

683
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,909
to families that asked no questions.

684
01:01:57,113 --> 01:01:59,377
I couldn't have children.
I'd had every treatment.

685
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,877
This opportunity came through
Roberto's office. I asked...

686
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,042
no questions. Now,
I don't know whom to ask.

687
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,417
Roberto won't tell me a thing.

688
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,050
But I'm getting organized.

689
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,523
I know the hospital
where she was born.

690
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:15,062
I know the approximate date,
her weight and height.

691
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:18,358
I know she had a type of
his dislocation here.

692
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:20,732
You're going to help me.

693
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,197
Come to the hospital with me.

694
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:28,109
Remember? We always went
everywhere together. Even to pee!

695
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,418
Please go back to the archives.

696
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:48,991
They sent me here.
You send me back!

697
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:58,063
But you're the one
who sent me to the archives.

698
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:01,005
They say that you must have it.

699
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,838
I told you we don't have
the 1978 records.

700
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:10,010
Ma'am, that's for the current year.

701
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,562
They won't help you, dear?

702
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:34,503
It's sad to have troubles
and get treat ed badly, too.

703
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:38,979
I'm also looking for my family.

704
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,279
Could we help each other?

705
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,576
No. It's not that.

706
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:46,954
You're looking for a baby?

707
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:52,524
Yes.

708
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:02,997
Lamb of God, who takes away
the sins of the world.

709
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,303
Be merciful on us.

710
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:09,975
Lamb of God, who takes away
the sins of the world.

711
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:11,610
Give us peace.

712
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:18,443
It is not a shame to be poor...

713
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:23,014
just as it is not an honor to be rich.

714
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:24,592
It's better to be rich.

715
01:04:24,927 --> 01:04:28,419
That depends on what you had
to do to get there...

716
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:32,495
and what you're willing to
to go on doing.

717
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:34,663
All right, but if you don't steal.

718
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:39,374
The thieves on TV aren't
the only thieves, you know.

719
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:42,343
You'd rather be
poor, Grandpa?

720
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:49,475
I can't help it. But I do
like having a clean conscience.

721
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:55,623
How about some vermouth?

722
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:01,194
My dear sister-in-law, would
you be making a pass at me?

723
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:06,367
You must get plenty of offers.

724
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:09,603
With my looks!

725
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:11,963
You realize that women...

726
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:16,476
go crazy over a starving
widower who’s lost his factory...

727
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:18,011
with 3 kids...

728
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:21,216
and who's forced to go back
to live with his folks.

729
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:24,649
My picture's on the cover
of the top magazines!

730
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:26,688
"Most Eligible Man of the Year"

731
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:34,696
Name one woman who
ever refused you.

732
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:36,991
You're kidding!
But I'm careful...

733
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,991
I don't jump into a pool
without water.

734
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:42,561
Still, there was one
who rejected me.

735
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:45,237
Cecilia rejected me.

736
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:48,033
I jumped in twice.

737
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:51,142
Twice she said no. But
finally, she couldn't resist.

738
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:03,056
Roberto, how could you?

739
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,719
I scold the kids for teasing animals!

740
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,060
Do you use the washing machine?

741
01:06:16,238 --> 01:06:18,570
Yes, son. Thank you.

742
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:20,736
Come on, Mom.

743
01:06:22,244 --> 01:06:23,541
Don't get mad.

744
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:26,043
It's that I'm grateful
every time I use it.

745
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,475
I'm so happy that you came.

746
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,343
But promise me...

747
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:33,749
Why me? Why don't you
ask them to promise?

748
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,624
I've asked them too,

749
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:41,024
Have you seen the recent
news in the papers?

750
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:42,355
The announcement s?

751
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,230
They say there are missing babies...

752
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:48,236
So, what about it?

753
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,166
Has anyone said anything?

754
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,067
No. Nobody said anything.

755
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:55,336
- It's possible.
- Possible!

756
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,047
Just think.

757
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:01,242
Mother!

758
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:02,443
Let's eat?

759
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:06,778
Your dad and your brother are
well liked in the neighborhood.

760
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:10,087
They're highly respected.

761
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:11,020
I know.

762
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:13,658
Did you speak to Roberto?

763
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:17,462
Maybe Roberto doesn't know either.

764
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:24,795
See, it's nice enough
to eat on the patio.

765
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:29,066
You were right, son. But the
radio predicted bad weather.

766
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:31,044
The clouds scared me.

767
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:35,547
Your mother doesn't learn.
She believes anything they say.

768
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:39,383
Were my son and I
ever wrong about the weather?

769
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:42,650
By saying your "son"
you mean Enrique, don't you?

770
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:47,124
It's a habit. He lives here.
And, come to think of it...

771
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:52,497
When do we ever look up at the sky?

772
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:55,303
Only if it rains dollars!

773
01:07:57,339 --> 01:07:58,636
Let it rain dollars!

774
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:00,199
Another helping?

775
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:06,336
I can't win!
They do a great job on me.

776
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:08,839
Roberto, your Mom’s talking.

777
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:11,152
You, Mom, even Gaby.

778
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:16,385
They work me over until
I lose out again!

779
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,725
I made it with prawns,
the way you like it.

780
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:24,360
Let's see, how did it start
this time? Yes, the weather!

781
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:27,394
Even Mom got involved with
the weather.

782
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:29,327
Kids, go play!

783
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,866
Why the hell do you ask us here?

784
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,874
Go play in the backyard. Go on!

785
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:43,250
Dad, this time Roberto's right.

786
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:45,184
Listen, Enrique...

787
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:48,618
You can stick your defense
right up your ass!

788
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:49,518
You understand?

789
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:51,424
May I talk?

790
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:55,457
Go on! Watch the clouds with
Daddy and calculate the winds.

791
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:56,823
May I talk?

792
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:57,855
Yes, talk!

793
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:01,897
It was a bad joke, an ugly joke.

794
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:04,502
I'm talking!

795
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:06,302
Can't one...

796
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:08,571
joke about one's son?

797
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:10,302
What a joke, Dad!

798
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:11,171
I'm talking!

799
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:15,908
As your father I raised
you for something else.

800
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:20,185
Your brother’s too fond
of wine. And you...

801
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:24,451
And you're too fond of money.

802
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:27,224
But your brother never gets drunk.

803
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:29,831
He prefers other things to wine.

804
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:32,800
And you...

805
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:36,629
We'd probably get along
better if you were a drunk.

806
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:41,742
Of course, you'd love me
a lot if I were a failure.

807
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:47,673
The whole country's collapsed,
all except...

808
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:50,511
the sons of bitches...

809
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:52,383
the thieves...

810
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:58,217
their cohorts, and my eldest son:
They struck it rich!

811
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:04,496
And you'll die believing that. Right?

812
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,762
You'll never admit that you're
buried in shit up to here!

813
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:13,367
You and your kind!

814
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:18,907
What's going on? Roberto, please!

815
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:21,579
You keep using machines
that are 40 years old.

816
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:24,348
The world moves ahead, you know!

817
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,852
And it crushes those
who watch the clouds!

818
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:30,659
You dare repeat such immoral
things while people are starving?

819
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,487
Starving? Who's starving here?

820
01:10:33,762 --> 01:10:35,821
Who the hell is starving? Tell me!

821
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:38,294
In this house they still...

822
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:43,369
choke on meaningless words,
reciting old anarchist shit!

823
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:49,600
The Spanish Civil War is over.
And you lost it!

824
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:54,643
You want me to feel guilty
because I'm not a loser.

825
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,316
No, No! I' not a loser.

826
01:10:57,519 --> 01:11:00,579
Get that into your head!
I'm not a loser!

827
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:09,024
And this other war?

828
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:12,864
The war you and your bunch won.

829
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:18,536
You know who lost it,
brother? The kids.

830
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:21,874
Kids like mine.

831
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:25,709
They'll be paying for the
dollars that were swiped.

832
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:29,682
And they'll repay them by
not eating and not studying.

833
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:36,323
Because you won't repay them.
Of course! Why should you?

834
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:38,918
You're not a loser!

835
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:17,922
MURDERED IN HIS MOTHER'S WOMB

836
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:29,808
FOUND MURDERED

837
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:35,748
Let's see. Here's something.

838
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:38,576
Between March 15 and 20. Right?

839
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:39,651
More or less.

840
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:44,015
Although the girl is younger.

841
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,518
You're sure it's that hospital?

842
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:47,151
In La Plata.

843
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:55,525
And the anatomical data,
size of skull, thorax...

844
01:12:55,704 --> 01:12:59,071
they'd all be recorded in
a hospital's archives?

845
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:01,807
Well, no. But we don't have such data.

846
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:03,843
Even if we had, it wouldn't help.

847
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:06,780
We've nothing to compare them with.

848
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:13,045
Or have you something
to compare with?

849
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:14,850
No.

850
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:29,034
Patience, gentlemen.
It won't belong now.

851
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:31,029
A drink, Dante?

852
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:32,998
No thanks.

853
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:35,700
I need a steady hand to beat this guy.

854
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:38,136
May I use the phone?

855
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:41,511
Then Andrada won't be
able to call here.

856
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:43,079
Just a quick call.

857
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:44,509
Go ahead, use it!

858
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:47,087
Andrada won't call, anyway.

859
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:49,022
He says "Gelby" instead of Gaby!

860
01:13:49,491 --> 01:13:50,583
You must teach him!

861
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:53,484
Mommy will kill us if you're
not in bed soon!

862
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:55,829
So what? She's not here now.

863
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:59,658
- Can I wait up for her a little while?
- Just a little?

864
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:02,866
Then I'll eat all your food.

865
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,602
But you already ate!
This food isn't for little girls.

866
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:12,643
Daddy, men don't cook. Women do.

867
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:14,611
Have you had your medicine?

868
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:17,645
One more, General, and it's over!

869
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:20,119
It seems you're winning.

870
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:21,513
Who plays to lose?

871
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:23,985
I like to see him enjoy it.

872
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:25,925
Give me a kiss.

873
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:29,497
Your mother seems to
have abandoned us.

874
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:31,698
I'll do it.

875
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:37,137
Get off the phone.

876
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:40,932
There's no answer.

877
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:45,274
I think I'll have to leave.

878
01:14:48,217 --> 01:14:52,153
At noon she took the boy to her
mother's and hasn't returned.

879
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:55,522
Be patient, Argentine women
are a special breed.

880
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,194
Rosa, lower the flame...

881
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:01,790
and keep stirring.

882
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:05,656
From here I can smell
the gravy setting.

883
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:08,829
That's the secret of
a good cook: Smelling.

884
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:12,237
All I know how to cook is a barbeque.

885
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:14,971
In the country that's all we learned.

886
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:17,543
I can't imagine my dad making gravy.

887
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:19,544
If we only do what our dads do...

888
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:20,574
My dad!

889
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:22,877
How would there be any progress?

890
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:25,846
I'd never have gotten
on the Board of Directors!

891
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,891
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were celebrating.

892
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:43,629
Celebrating what?

893
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:47,041
There's nothing to celebrate.

894
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:49,108
I had a problem.

895
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:52,339
I'll tell you later.

896
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:58,017
I think Andrada will
leave us in the lurch.

897
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:03,782
All of us, except the Yank,
who's probably his partner...

898
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:07,723
What? I don't understand!
What happened?

899
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:13,895
That's what I say.
What happened to your hair?

900
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:38,223
"This counter-revolutionary
persecution...

901
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:40,390
contrary to the ideals of May...

902
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:42,887
was aimed at exterminating
the patriots...

903
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:45,391
who tried to extend
throughout America...

904
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:48,292
the influence of the
liberation of the Rio de la Plata...

905
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:52,906
where an arm bore a knife
that struck Monteagudo's back...

906
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:57,109
and sliced Castelli's tongue
to silence him.

907
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:00,911
The ensuing battle between
Unitarians and Federalists..."

908
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:04,050
Mr. Costa, what did you
say here about Castelli?

909
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:11,248
They cut his tongue
in jail, so he wouldn't talk.

910
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:15,194
What is your reference?

911
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:16,725
What do you mean?

912
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:22,762
In what book did you read that?

913
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:25,135
You only believe what's
written in books?

914
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:31,978
For events of over150 years ago,
it makes sense...

915
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,842
to refer to existing documentation.

916
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:41,289
Seriously, Costa.
The protagonists are dead!

917
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:45,987
Moreno, Saavedra, Monteagudo,
Pueyrredón, Dorrego, Lavalle...

918
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:52,433
Rosas, Mitre, and poor Castelli,
not only mute, but dead!

919
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:54,669
Therefore...

920
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:57,294
unless you're in touch
with spirit s...

921
01:17:58,306 --> 01:18:02,868
I'll ask you to supply
literary references, since you're...

922
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,377
interested in historical research.

923
01:18:05,947 --> 01:18:06,971
You get A minus.

924
01:18:53,995 --> 01:18:55,360
I like your hair down.

925
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:57,063
Don't I look wild?

926
01:18:58,133 --> 01:18:59,760
I must like wild ladies.

927
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:11,038
Your pieces are everywhere.

928
01:19:13,348 --> 01:19:15,475
I played against myself and won.

929
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,019
Well?

930
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:27,821
What?

931
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:31,756
Are you students
still raising hell?

932
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:32,826
Yes.

933
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:37,529
If you keep
dropping burning matches...

934
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:41,240
how can you avoid
explosions around you?

935
01:19:42,911 --> 01:19:45,141
Many explosions all around?

936
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:47,949
What's happened?

937
01:19:49,584 --> 01:19:51,074
Everything seems to be falling apart.

938
01:19:52,988 --> 01:19:55,081
It is! It's all falling apart.

939
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:01,085
But not everything.

940
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:04,228
We shouldn't expect too much.

941
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:10,871
Although you're always ready
to swallow the bait.

942
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,101
Some tea.

943
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:19,240
And this isn't the end of it.
You people would like it to be.

944
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:25,977
Bebitez, who are "you people"?

945
01:20:29,891 --> 01:20:32,883
Nothing more touching than
a guilty bourgeois lady.

946
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:44,005
To quote an old dear friend of mine...

947
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:48,899
Why don't you fuck off just a little?

948
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:57,483
Julieta's mommy wants you to call her.

949
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:05,187
I won't play with her.
She made fun of Macarena.

950
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:07,156
Why did she do that?

951
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:11,488
They were so stupid!
They called her: "Baby! Baby!"

952
01:21:18,473 --> 01:21:22,307
But Teresa and Dianita
and I defended her.

953
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:09,613
Hello.

954
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:39,085
We don't see each other much.

955
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:47,460
Oh, damn it!

956
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:54,261
That stupid Rosa keeps
rearranging the furniture!

957
01:22:57,238 --> 01:22:59,172
Aren't you drinking a lot lately?

958
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:03,677
A blind man wouldn't last
two days in this house!

959
01:23:11,286 --> 01:23:12,253
How nice, how nice.

960
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:25,589
Today I called at 8 o'clock...

961
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:30,565
and Rosa said you'd come in
and gone out again.

962
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:35,166
What are you up to?

963
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:40,581
I'm afraid.

964
01:23:43,284 --> 01:23:44,251
Afraid of what?

965
01:23:48,356 --> 01:23:50,221
Will you answer a question?

966
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:56,656
Could Gaby be
a missing mother's child?

967
01:23:59,634 --> 01:24:03,161
Where do you get such ideas?

968
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:11,070
What a silly idiot I am!
Of course!

969
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:16,742
The moment I saw her, I knew
something would happen!

970
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:18,780
Anna has nothing
to do with it.

971
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,519
It's all over the newspapers!

972
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:24,257
She lived with a subversive!

973
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:30,798
I don't understand how
she managed to come back...

974
01:24:31,299 --> 01:24:33,699
and is allowed to
go about her business freely.

975
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:37,535
Who lived with such a subversive?

976
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,540
Why do you think she left?

977
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:41,665
Why?

978
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:43,442
You knew who Pedro was?

979
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:45,201
No. I didn't know.

980
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:49,248
She said they'd been separated
for4 years and...

981
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:52,214
she'd not seen him 2 years
before they took her.

982
01:24:52,387 --> 01:24:54,355
Of course she'd say that!

983
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:57,786
And you knew about it?

984
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:02,619
You knew?

985
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:07,802
How come you knew?

986
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:12,239
How do I know, Alicia!
Maybe you told me.

987
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:37,131
Are you angry?

988
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:39,661
No, my love, I'm not angry.

989
01:25:42,203 --> 01:25:44,763
Rosa can't make pigtails,
but you know how.

990
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:48,767
Because when I was little,
I wore pigtails.

991
01:26:51,906 --> 01:26:56,741
I don't know who snapped
that one. Probably the old man.

992
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:01,211
Look at the lovely water
in that stream.

993
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,741
You can see his foot
clearly under the water.

994
01:27:06,955 --> 01:27:09,617
He looks skinny, but he was strong.

995
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:12,754
She was already reading. Look.

996
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:17,765
They were 5. No more.

997
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:23,830
See the little scar on her cheek?

998
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:29,443
Yes. Unless you knew,
it looked like a smudge.

999
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:32,912
The Diaz boys were playing.

1000
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:36,876
They weren't used to
playing with girls.

1001
01:27:38,052 --> 01:27:41,579
Once, when the old man wasn't
looking, they threw a rock at her.

1002
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:46,920
It bled a lot but she didn't cry.

1003
01:27:48,796 --> 01:27:52,892
And he threw the 4 Diaz
boys into the water. All 4!

1004
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:58,600
He fought with them, head-on.
That's how he fought.

1005
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:05,975
Then he sat down next to her
to keep her company.

1006
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:09,845
They had never met before.

1007
01:28:10,685 --> 01:28:11,344
But after this...

1008
01:28:13,755 --> 01:28:15,416
nobody could separate them.

1009
01:28:16,991 --> 01:28:17,616
Nobody.

1010
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:22,626
Braulio took this photo.

1011
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:27,857
It was his birthday and
they gave him a camera.

1012
01:28:29,003 --> 01:28:31,972
He took pictures of everything.

1013
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:36,300
He shot the whole roll, all
without any advance warning.

1014
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,448
She still had pigtails, see?

1015
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:46,482
We used to call her "heron legs"...

1016
01:28:47,855 --> 01:28:49,379
because her legs were so skinny.

1017
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:55,460
Such innocence! Since they
were behind the table...

1018
01:28:56,698 --> 01:28:58,131
they thought nobody
could see them.

1019
01:29:02,904 --> 01:29:05,338
It seems incredible.
They were already engaged.

1020
01:29:17,452 --> 01:29:18,976
She kept laughing
on their wedding day.

1021
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:27,359
It was probably nerves.
She said her shoes pinched.

1022
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:33,425
It was her first time in high heels.

1023
01:29:34,802 --> 01:29:36,360
She was 19.

1024
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:42,900
The judge who married them
spoke nicely to them.

1025
01:29:44,112 --> 01:29:46,410
Too bad she couldn't stop laughing.

1026
01:29:52,954 --> 01:29:56,947
He looks bigger than he is.
It's the suit.

1027
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:02,724
A factory pal lent it to him.
It was tight in the shoulders.

1028
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:11,131
When they left the judge's,
he took it off and returned it.

1029
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:25,484
Here they'd been married one year.

1030
01:30:26,821 --> 01:30:29,016
You could hardly tell she was pregnant.

1031
01:30:31,225 --> 01:30:33,887
We were all there
because it was a Sunday.

1032
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:37,989
We all brought something
for the barbeque.

1033
01:30:38,232 --> 01:30:42,692
We helped unload the bricks
and stuff for another wall...

1034
01:30:43,004 --> 01:30:46,030
because they only had
one brick wall. See?

1035
01:30:50,244 --> 01:30:50,869
Well.

1036
01:30:53,581 --> 01:30:57,881
Some neighbors who saw
them being taken away...

1037
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:04,113
say that the fire might
not have been intentional.

1038
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:11,056
Since they destroyed everything
and there was only one brick wall.

1039
01:31:14,068 --> 01:31:15,194
Nothing was left...

1040
01:31:17,839 --> 01:31:18,498
Nothing.

1041
01:31:22,877 --> 01:31:25,004
Only these four photos of them.

1042
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:30,117
And our memory.

1043
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:39,216
I'm not saying that she is...

1044
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:44,822
But the dates coincide,
more or less. Right?

1045
01:31:46,634 --> 01:31:47,658
And there's this photo.

1046
01:31:49,537 --> 01:31:52,028
You might realize
that the girl you have...

1047
01:31:58,079 --> 01:31:59,774
could well be my granddaughter.

1048
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:16,722
Don't cry.

1049
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:19,860
Crying doesn't help.

1050
01:32:23,838 --> 01:32:25,328
I know why I'm telling you.

1051
01:32:30,077 --> 01:32:31,704
It doesn't help to cry.

1052
01:32:53,834 --> 01:32:54,766
Why are you here?

1053
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:57,594
Your secretary said you're
here. I'll gladly see you.

1054
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:02,372
I'm busy now. Some other
time I'll gladly see you.

1055
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:05,110
I hate talking to you but I must.

1056
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:07,144
Alicia doesn't return my calls.

1057
01:33:08,015 --> 01:33:11,007
How about that! Good for her!

1058
01:33:11,686 --> 01:33:12,778
Is the ship sinking?

1059
01:33:18,392 --> 01:33:21,759
Do you know what's
going on in Alicia's head?

1060
01:33:23,898 --> 01:33:26,662
I know what you're
trying to put in her head.

1061
01:33:26,867 --> 01:33:30,894
If I could influence her,
she wouldn't have married you!

1062
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:33,767
Sure! You'd have found
her a husband like yours!

1063
01:33:35,042 --> 01:33:37,169
You should all be swept away.

1064
01:33:38,379 --> 01:33:39,038
Like garbage!

1065
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:43,083
They did that! Swept them away
and buried them!

1066
01:33:43,351 --> 01:33:44,181
Like garbage!

1067
01:33:46,053 --> 01:33:47,611
You knew who Pedro was?

1068
01:33:47,888 --> 01:33:49,947
He was the exact opposite of you!

1069
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:52,316
You both hated each other.

1070
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:55,322
He hated me? Why should he hate me?

1071
01:33:55,663 --> 01:33:58,860
You're more perfect!
He's never ask that question.

1072
01:33:59,367 --> 01:34:03,326
So, you're innocent? You had
nothing to do with anything?

1073
01:34:04,005 --> 01:34:06,735
Maybe you denounced me,
to ingratiate yourself...

1074
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:08,369
with some friend?

1075
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:11,342
I would have been glad to do it.

1076
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:19,078
Who told you? Who?

1077
01:34:21,222 --> 01:34:22,814
Then he's disappeared...

1078
01:34:24,692 --> 01:34:30,392
Yes, Rolo. He disappeared.
Vanished. Gone forever!

1079
01:34:32,233 --> 01:34:34,701
Nothing. Nothing.
I'm laughing at us.

1080
01:34:37,038 --> 01:34:40,474
Who would denounce him, Rolo,
if nothing can be proved?

1081
01:34:42,943 --> 01:34:46,379
All's well. The girl's asleep.
The maid's asleep. Relax.

1082
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:47,270
Forgive me.

1083
01:34:48,716 --> 01:34:51,344
Stop. Why are you telling me that?

1084
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:54,713
No! I have nothing
to do with it!

1085
01:34:56,357 --> 01:34:58,791
I'm telling you. I had
nothing to do with it.

1086
01:35:00,061 --> 01:35:00,720
Nothing.

1087
01:35:03,464 --> 01:35:06,160
You offered to pick
her up at school.

1088
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:09,302
Sure, since you couldn't.
But it's 11.30 at night!

1089
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:19,062
<i>No pardon, no amnesty.</i>
<i>We want them alive.</i>

1090
01:36:29,517 --> 01:36:30,950
<i>Now it's become imperative...</i>

1091
01:36:31,418 --> 01:36:35,115
<i>that they appear alive, and</i>
<i>the culprits are punished.</i>

1092
01:37:00,581 --> 01:37:02,139
<i>We want our school children!</i>

1093
01:37:02,349 --> 01:37:04,977
<i>They took them alive.</i>
<i>We want them back alive.</i>

1094
01:37:40,254 --> 01:37:43,189
FAMILIES OF THE MISSING
AND IMPRISONED

1095
01:37:56,570 --> 01:37:58,060
AND HER BABY BORN
IN CAPTIVITY

1096
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:02,465
<i>Let them tell us where</i>
<i>the missing ones are.</i>

1097
01:38:14,421 --> 01:38:16,912
If Gaby's your grandchild,
what do we do?

1098
01:38:41,282 --> 01:38:41,941
It's strange...

1099
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:45,916
I always thought that...

1100
01:38:48,022 --> 01:38:51,048
I would do anything to
avoid losing what I had...

1101
01:38:53,294 --> 01:38:55,455
that I'd be capable...

1102
01:38:58,465 --> 01:39:00,092
of anything as long as...

1103
01:39:05,005 --> 01:39:07,200
as long as everything
remained as it was.

1104
01:39:10,711 --> 01:39:11,609
Strange, isn't it?

1105
01:39:16,583 --> 01:39:19,518
I didn't want to lose
what I love, but I couldn't...

1106
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:27,692
I'd like to introduce...

1107
01:39:28,362 --> 01:39:30,193
- Not now. I'm busy.
- Please.

1108
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:39,633
Mrs. Reballo, my husband,
Roberto Ibañez.

1109
01:39:47,748 --> 01:39:48,407
Reballo.

1110
01:39:50,784 --> 01:39:52,775
I knew a Reballo at the university.

1111
01:39:54,355 --> 01:39:56,220
That was so long ago.

1112
01:39:57,191 --> 01:39:59,557
We're not from the city.

1113
01:40:11,372 --> 01:40:13,738
Sara could be Gaby's grandmother.

1114
01:40:23,817 --> 01:40:26,149
You are completely crazy!

1115
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:31,180
Is this a trap?

1116
01:40:31,792 --> 01:40:33,157
In my own house?

1117
01:40:34,661 --> 01:40:37,494
What's happening to you,
you poor idiot?

1118
01:40:38,198 --> 01:40:41,326
Do you realize what you're
doing? What are you? Afraid?

1119
01:40:41,835 --> 01:40:44,599
Do you want to get rid of the girl?

1120
01:40:45,205 --> 01:40:48,697
You need not to give her to the first
nut you see on the street.

1121
01:40:54,148 --> 01:40:58,141
Get this bag lady out of here.
Out of my house!

1122
01:41:47,901 --> 01:41:48,890
Well, I'm leaving.

1123
01:41:51,905 --> 01:41:54,339
Tomorrow, will you call me...

1124
01:41:55,642 --> 01:41:56,540
or should I call you?

1125
01:41:58,812 --> 01:41:59,779
I'll call you, Sara.

1126
01:42:21,702 --> 01:42:22,396
Until tomorrow.

1127
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:01,808
I don't understand.

1128
01:43:03,744 --> 01:43:05,575
What's happening to you?

1129
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,913
What do you want to do with Gaby?

1130
01:43:09,583 --> 01:43:10,413
I want to know.

1131
01:43:10,584 --> 01:43:11,710
To know what?

1132
01:43:12,986 --> 01:43:14,544
Why was she given to you?

1133
01:43:16,590 --> 01:43:19,423
What did they do to
her mother? Is she alive?

1134
01:43:19,593 --> 01:43:22,721
How do I know?
What am I? A torturer?

1135
01:43:22,896 --> 01:43:24,557
Why should we care?

1136
01:43:24,898 --> 01:43:27,196
We should care. It concerns us.

1137
01:43:30,504 --> 01:43:32,563
You're too scared to face that woman.

1138
01:43:32,873 --> 01:43:35,307
I want nothing to do
with those people.

1139
01:43:35,609 --> 01:43:36,268
Nothing!

1140
01:43:37,477 --> 01:43:39,001
Do you know who they are?

1141
01:43:41,014 --> 01:43:42,447
How could you know?

1142
01:43:43,617 --> 01:43:45,346
You don't know what's
under your nose!

1143
01:43:47,354 --> 01:43:49,720
Of course I'm scared, you idiot!

1144
01:44:00,334 --> 01:44:03,462
Some very serious things have
happened. Andrada's vanished.

1145
01:44:03,637 --> 01:44:06,868
And I'm in it up to here!
The general is raving mad!

1146
01:44:07,341 --> 01:44:10,367
He says he's going to
make them pay for it.

1147
01:44:10,877 --> 01:44:11,901
We might lose everything!

1148
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:13,008
We might lose Goby!

1149
01:44:13,347 --> 01:44:14,871
You'll lose Gaby! You!

1150
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:32,956
And if it's true?

1151
01:44:41,708 --> 01:44:43,767
If the parents were what you said.

1152
01:44:45,812 --> 01:44:47,074
Would it change anything?

1153
01:44:49,549 --> 01:44:50,072
Would it?

1154
01:44:52,686 --> 01:44:56,645
She's already lost a mother.
You want her to lose another one?

1155
01:44:57,057 --> 01:44:58,024
Is that what you want?

1156
01:45:01,628 --> 01:45:02,287
Listen...

1157
01:45:07,701 --> 01:45:09,601
I know how much you love the girl.

1158
01:45:13,407 --> 01:45:16,535
We're raising her properly, aren't we?

1159
01:45:20,847 --> 01:45:22,815
- She's better off with us.
- Then it's true.

1160
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:40,061
Who brought that old
woman here? Who?

1161
01:45:40,901 --> 01:45:43,369
You don't even care if it's true!

1162
01:45:47,908 --> 01:45:51,503
I do care! I don't want
to do this to Gaby!

1163
01:45:52,913 --> 01:45:57,782
I brought her because I want
to know if Gaby's her grandchild...

1164
01:45:58,752 --> 01:46:00,583
or someone else's grandchild.

1165
01:46:02,055 --> 01:46:05,855
Or the grandchild of someone
who hasn't the strength to...

1166
01:46:05,992 --> 01:46:08,483
walk around the plaza
with a poster.

1167
01:46:28,081 --> 01:46:29,048
Gaby's not here.

1168
01:46:39,459 --> 01:46:40,483
Where is Gaby?

1169
01:46:41,895 --> 01:46:42,919
Where's Gaby?

1170
01:46:43,096 --> 01:46:44,085
Horrible, isn't it?

1171
01:46:44,464 --> 01:46:45,431
What's horrible?

1172
01:46:46,466 --> 01:46:47,626
Not knowing where
your daughter is!

1173
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:51,528
Where's my daughter?

1174
01:46:51,972 --> 01:46:53,166
At your mother's house!

1175
01:46:53,507 --> 01:46:54,531
Where's my daughter?

1176
01:46:54,741 --> 01:46:57,676
I had Rosa take her to
your folks, so we could talk.

1177
01:46:58,044 --> 01:46:59,443
Let me go, Roberto!

1178
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:03,075
Let me go!

1179
01:47:30,844 --> 01:47:32,141
Hello. Yes, mother.

1180
01:47:33,447 --> 01:47:35,438
No, I was in the other room.

1181
01:47:38,018 --> 01:47:38,985
Nothing. Nothing.

1182
01:47:46,827 --> 01:47:49,125
Tell her to say goodnight to me first.

1183
01:47:56,536 --> 01:47:57,002
<i>Hello, Daddy.</i>

1184
01:47:57,537 --> 01:47:58,162
Hello, my love.

1185
01:47:58,738 --> 01:48:00,000
<i>Can I talk to Mommy?</i>

1186
01:48:00,173 --> 01:48:01,800
She's not...
<i>Call her.</i>

1187
01:48:02,809 --> 01:48:03,776
She's coming now.

1188
01:48:15,956 --> 01:48:16,854
Will you sleep there?

1189
01:48:17,757 --> 01:48:19,725
<i>With grandma and grandpa.</i>

1190
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:20,919
Fine.

1191
01:48:21,194 --> 01:48:23,685
<i>But I want to sing forMommy.</i>

1192
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:24,987
If...

1193
01:48:26,766 --> 01:48:28,256
You sing loud she'll hear you.

1194
01:48:31,638 --> 01:48:33,868
<i>I know the whole song. Listen.</i>

1195
01:48:36,610 --> 01:48:39,670
<i>In the land of I-don't-remember...</i>

1196
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:44,676
<i>I take three steps and I'm lost.</i>

1197
01:48:48,188 --> 01:48:53,182
<i>One step this way. I wonder if I may.</i>

1198
01:48:54,761 --> 01:48:58,527
<i>One step over there.</i>

1199
01:49:02,068 --> 01:49:05,868
<i>Oh, what a big scare.</i>

1200
01:49:14,548 --> 01:49:17,039
<i>In the land of I-don't-remember...</i>

1201
01:49:19,753 --> 01:49:23,746
<i>I take three steps and I'm lost.</i>

1202
01:49:25,926 --> 01:49:27,917
<i>One step backward fast.</i>

1203
01:49:31,631 --> 01:49:33,121
<i>And that'll be my last.</i>

1204
01:49:38,772 --> 01:49:43,573
<i>Because I no longer know</i>
<i>where my other foot will go.</i>

1205
01:49:48,381 --> 01:49:51,873
<i>Daddy? Did you hear me?</i>
<i>Did you like it?</i>

1206
01:49:55,855 --> 01:49:58,085
Yes. I liked it a lot.

1207
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:00,892
<i>Now I'm sleepy.</i>

1208
01:50:01,595 --> 01:50:02,391
Here's a kiss.

1209
01:50:03,597 --> 01:50:06,794
<i>Here's one for you and one for Mommy.</i>

1210
01:50:09,869 --> 01:50:11,894
<i>Should I hang up, Daddy?</i>

1211
01:50:15,208 --> 01:50:18,234
Yes, my love. Hang up.

1212
01:50:18,812 --> 01:50:19,836
<i>Good night, Daddy.</i>

1213
01:50:23,316 --> 01:50:24,943
Good night, love of my life.

1214
01:50:52,312 --> 01:50:55,645
In the land of I-don't-remember...

1215
01:50:59,285 --> 01:51:03,881
I take three steps and I'm lost.

1216
01:51:06,059 --> 01:51:09,187
One step this way.

1217
01:51:11,798 --> 01:51:14,164
I wonder if I may.

1218
01:51:16,302 --> 01:51:18,827
One step over there.

1219
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:25,834
Oh, what a big scare.
