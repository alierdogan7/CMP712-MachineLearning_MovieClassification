<i>Ragnar: Previously on "Vikings":</i>

2
00:00:02,151 --> 00:00:04,319
Thorvard: The Saxons treacherously
attacked King Horik's camp.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,755
The king and his son, Erlendur,
escaped with their lives.

4
00:00:06,856 --> 00:00:08,223
Ragnar: What about Athelstan?

5

<i>Bishop Edmund:

I know things about Ragnar
Lothbrok you do not know.

8

How do I know you and
I can trust each other?

<i>It is always a strength to know
the weaknesses of your friends.</i>

Lagertha: Bjorn is very happy here.

11
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:25,400
Then you both should stay.

12
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:28,270
<i>Lagertha: I must go back to
my husband. I have a duty.</i>

13
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:31,773
But I leave my son in your good hands.

14
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:35,277
Lagertha: Don't!
Sigvard: I am your husband!

<i>Ragnar: I want to destroy Jarl Borg</i>

16
00:00:37,113 --> 00:00:39,384
<i>and to kill him with my bare hands.</i>

17
00:00:39,385 --> 00:00:43,385
To make him suffer, as he's

Everything I had, everything I possessed,

everything that I was
has been stripped away from me.

35
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:12,880
And my anger is like a stone...

36
00:02:17,052 --> 00:02:18,753
A stone that I carry inside me

37
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:22,290
that... Weighs me down.

38
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:26,928
I... I cannot lift it.

<i>Seer: In some ways,
you are still fortunate.</i>

40
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,300

44
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,945
I ask you once more,
why you have come here.

45
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:46,749
I want to know,

46
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:53,789
will the gods ever smile on me again?

<i>Seer: The gods will always smile

48
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:01,564
like the Valkyries,

49
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:06,369
those furies who men fear and desire.

<i>Man: Erik!</i>

56
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,224
You'll have to forgive
the poverty of the feast.

57
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:05,861
It has been a hard winter.

58
00:04:05,929 --> 00:04:07,797
We had to burn our own grain stores

59
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:09,699
to rid ourselves of Jarl Borg.

60
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,534
Horik: So I heard.

61
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,671
Ragnar: Tell us, Erlendur,

62
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:18,541
what happened in England, after we left?

63
00:04:20,744 --> 00:04:24,213
<i>King Horik: Ecbert never meant to
honor his promises to you.</i>

64
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:28,851
We were betrayed, taken by surprise;

65
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,487
<i>Erlendur and I barely
escaped with our lives.</i>

66
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:34,757
What about Athelstan? Where is he now?

67
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:39,395
If he is fortunate, he died in battle.

68
00:04:39,463 --> 00:04:42,431
<i>In any case, let's not speak of him.</i>

69
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:47,169
He was a worthless individual.

70
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,705
<i>Bjorn: Poor Athelstan.</i>

71
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:52,608
My sister and I grew to love him
when we were children.

72
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:55,945
<i>Floki: He fooled you, young Bjorn.</i>

73
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:59,281
He never denounced his Christian God!

74
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,551
He was our enemy.

75
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:05,588
We should rejoice at his death.

76
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:12,361
So... What do you intend on doing now?

77
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:15,331
King Horik: What do you think, Ragnar?

78
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,901
I intend on gaining revenge on King Ecbert.

79
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:21,871
We should plan a raid as soon as possible.

80
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:24,673
<i>Rollo: I would be very
happy to take part in it.</i>

81
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:27,209
King Ecbert should certainly be punished.

82
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,180
I agree.

83
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:34,417
We should return to Wessex.

84
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:36,919
<i>But first, Jarl Borg must pay the price</i>

85
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,590
for what he did to my family
and to our people.

86
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:46,529
(Water pours)
Porunn: (Gasps)

87
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,264
Forgive me, master.

88
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:51,500
No, it doesn't matter.

89
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,935
<i>King Horik: I understand, completely,</i>

90
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:54,603
<i>and if I were you,
I would feel the same way.</i>

91
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:57,440
<i>But we must remember our agreement</i>

92
00:05:57,507 --> 00:05:59,742
<i>and what it was for.</i>

93
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:04,447
We would sail west to raid and to colonize.

94
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:09,785
That was your dream, Ragnar,
and I have come to share it.

95
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:13,622
But now we have neither
the men nor the ships

96
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,326
to realize our dreams.

97
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:21,397
- What are you saying?
- I think we should go back to Jarl Borg.

98
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:23,199
He is licking his wounds.

99
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,633
He is no longer as strong as he was.

100
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:28,437
And, yet, we need him.

101
00:06:28,505 --> 00:06:31,707
We cannot go west without his ships.

102
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,542
And so, once again,

103
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,612
we should ask him to join our alliance.

104
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:45,554
Aslaug: (Whispers quietly)
Don't listen to him.

105
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:48,190
Rollo: But who should go to Jarl Borg?

106
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:51,327
<i>King Horik: I think it should be you Rollo.</i>

107
00:06:51,428 --> 00:06:55,431
After all, you know him better than anyone.

108
00:06:57,232 --> 00:06:58,532
What do you think?

109
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:06,809
(Wind howls)

110
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,511
Farewell, my love.

111
00:07:08,612 --> 00:07:11,714
I will pray to Thor
that he grant you safe passage.

112
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:15,518
<i>Warrior 1: Throw that!</i>

113
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:19,455
King Horik: May you have success, Rollo,
for the sake of all of us.

114
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,892
<i>Warrior 1: Man your stations.
Warrior 2: Stores aboard.</i>

115
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:33,302
Warrior 1: All the men aboard!

116
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,671
Torstein: Rollo.

117
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:37,373
<i>Warrior 2: Try the sail then.</i>

118
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,409
I, too, wish you well.

119
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,745
Those words mean a lot coming from you.

120
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:46,982
They were hard to say. Now they are said.

121
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:54,490
Cast away!

122
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,193
<i>Warrior 1: Ready the oars!</i>

123
00:07:57,294 --> 00:08:02,431
(Oars stroke the water, water churns)

124
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:17,213
(Wind howls fiercely)

125
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,215

126
00:08:19,282 --> 00:08:21,283
(Fire crackles)

127
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,389
Horik: It has an unusual taste, wine.

128
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,726
But then, you're an unusual woman, Siggy.

129
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:36,899
I hope you do not mind
I brought my son with me?

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,637
I want him to start to understand the game.

131
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:43,172
The game?

132
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,175
The game you and I play.

133
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:50,779
The game Ragnar tries to play.

134
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:53,315
Are you sure it is a game?

135
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:59,922
Why do you invite me to your bed?

136
00:09:00,023 --> 00:09:03,959
Why do you tell me things about Ragnar?

137
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:12,234
Everything I do, I do for Rollo.

138
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:16,972
And not for yourself?

139
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:19,173
If Rollo rises, I rise also.

140
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,445
And you need my help!

141
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:25,114
(Chuckles)

142
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:28,317
(Chuckles) My son is ignorant of the game

143
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:32,755
<i>and strangely ignorant
of other things as well.</i>

144
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:34,123
<i>He's only been with a few women,</i>

145
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:36,959
<i>and they were nothing... Slaves, girls.</i>

146
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:44,266
I want him to enjoy the attentions

147
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:48,370
of an experienced, free woman.

148
00:09:48,438 --> 00:09:51,440

We don't really have poets here anymore.

164

Poets to entertain us!

165
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:41,583
Sing to us!

166
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:44,319
Make us laugh.

Laughter and good fellowship.

But, as you can all see, she has come back

175
00:12:11,448 --> 00:12:13,782

Lagertha: Skol, husband.

181
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,317
Unfortunately, you left my stepson behind.

182
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:52,187
Man: It's time to leave.

183

Woman: Gerta, take my hand. Come. Come.

185
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,133
He's old enough to decide.

186
00:13:05,235 --> 00:13:07,135
Is it not enough that I came back?

187
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:11,240
No, it's not enough, my dear wife,

188

<i>it's... It's not enough!</i>

189
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:16,278
Of course it's not enough.
It's an insult to me!

190
00:13:16,346 --> 00:13:18,914
What else could I have done?

191
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:21,216
His father is Ragnar Lothbrok.

192
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:23,986
(Sudden thud, cup clatters)

193
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:30,692
Who is this Ragnar Lothbrok?!

194
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:33,695
<i>Nothing but a windbag, an opportunist.</i>

195
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:36,465
A man so bloated with self-importance

196
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:38,934
he pretends to be descended from Odin!

197
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:42,237
<i>(Men laugh)</i>

198
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:44,640
He doesn't need to pretend anything.

(Drunken stumble, objects clatter)

200
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:56,251
Now I know for sure
why you went to defend him.

201
00:13:56,352 --> 00:13:58,754
Not to repulse a foreign invader,

202
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:01,390
as you lied to me,

203
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:03,892
but because you're still in love with him.

204
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,731
You're still in love with Ragnar Lothbrok,

205
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:15,637
aren't you, wife?

206
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:22,811
(Drunken stumble, objects clatter)

207
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:25,714
You can sleep alone tonight.

208
00:14:25,815 --> 00:14:28,550

Master, can I help you?

221
00:15:24,361 --> 00:15:27,530
I was going to ask you the same question.

222
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:29,932
Those buckets look very heavy.

223
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,001
I'm used to it.

224
00:15:36,173 --> 00:15:38,541
Bjorn: What is your name?

00:15:38,642 --> 00:15:40,643
Porunn: Porunn.

226
00:15:42,746 --> 00:15:44,680
Sit a moment.

227
00:15:44,748 --> 00:15:46,682
I have to finish my work.

228
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,619
It is all right.

229
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,621

Where do you sleep?

234
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:10,139
In that barn

235
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:14,310
with the other servants and animals.

236
00:16:14,378 --> 00:16:19,382
Do you... Have a boyfriend?

237
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,486

Hor decide everything?

245
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:06,963
Can you really forgive Jarl Borg?

246
00:17:09,499 --> 00:17:12,501
Do you know how much I
suffered because of him?

247
00:17:12,603 --> 00:17:15,137
How much your sons suffered?

248
00:17:17,307 --> 00:17:21,143
Yes, I know.

249
00:17:21,245 --> 00:17:24,280
But you do nothing about it!

250
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:26,048
By insulting and humiliating me,

251
00:17:26,149 --> 00:17:30,887
he insulted and humiliated you!

252
00:17:30,954 --> 00:17:33,422
My father never would have
allowed such a thing.

253
00:17:33,523 --> 00:17:35,758
He would have been revenged.

254
00:17:38,395 --> 00:17:41,998
Your father cannot do too much now,

255
00:17:42,065 --> 00:17:44,333
being dead.

(Approaching footsteps)

261
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,608
What is that?

262
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:33,049
Jarl Borg: The skull of my first wife.

263
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,619
She continues to advise me.

264
00:18:40,157 --> 00:18:43,960
Is that fair to her?

265
00:18:44,061 --> 00:18:48,433
So... Your brother wants me
to come and fight for him?

266
00:18:50,534 --> 00:18:53,202
He wants to rebuild the original alliance

267
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,604
between himself, King Horik, and you.

268
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:01,344
He believes that, in our small countries,

269
00:19:03,714 --> 00:19:07,917
cooperation is the only way forward.

270
00:19:08,018 --> 00:19:11,487
So he does not want revenge upon me?

271
00:19:11,555 --> 00:19:15,124
After all, I invaded his lands.

272
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:18,427
Men like you and I will
always look for revenge.

273
00:19:20,564 --> 00:19:22,331
Ragnar looks beyond.

274
00:19:22,432 --> 00:19:27,203
Then he is a most extraordinary man indeed.

275
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,940
As forgiving as a Christian!

276
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:34,977
He is also a practical man.

277
00:19:35,078 --> 00:19:38,881
He and King Horik have lost a lot of men.

278
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:42,284

I love these materials.

290

Brushes, the paints, the colors.

291
00:21:06,403 --> 00:21:09,438
I had not appreciated
how much I missed my work.

292
00:21:09,506 --> 00:21:12,475
The pagans have nothing like it?

293
00:21:12,576 --> 00:21:15,211
Athelstan: No. They have no art.

294
00:21:17,347 --> 00:21:18,681
They can neither read nor write,

295
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:21,584
except for their carved runes.

296
00:21:21,685 --> 00:21:24,320
King Ecbert: Mm.

297
00:21:24,387 --> 00:21:26,594
And their gods?

298
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:29,895
Uh... Odin and Thor and Freyr.

299
00:21:31,695 --> 00:21:34,697
How strange you must have found them?

300
00:21:38,135 --> 00:21:40,503
Their gods are very old.

301
00:21:40,604 --> 00:21:43,539
And sometimes I could not help
noticing some similarities

302
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:46,342
with our own God, and his son.

303
00:21:50,514 --> 00:21:52,515

309
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:17,573
You are only a monk, Athelstan,

310
00:22:17,641 --> 00:22:21,677

311
00:22:21,778 --> 00:22:26,649

<i>that they filled our world with such,</i>

315
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:46,001
as you say, indescribable beauty?

316
00:22:48,438 --> 00:22:50,973
I have been told, sire,

317
00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:54,343
<i>that you served at the court

318
00:22:54,444 --> 00:22:57,012
<i>which I have also visited.</i>

319
00:22:57,113 --> 00:22:58,480
I cannot imagine, therefore,

320
00:22:58,548 --> 00:23:02,151
that you do not know what I know.

321
00:23:02,252 --> 00:23:04,920
<i>That these images were
painted by the Romans.</i>

322
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:07,223
<i>They conquered these lands
a long time ago.</i>

323
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,024
They conquered the whole world.

324
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,663
But they were pagans.
They worshipped false gods.

325
00:23:18,301 --> 00:23:23,072
Never speak of our conversation
to any other man here.

326
00:23:23,173 --> 00:23:25,975
Nobody else would understand it;

327
00:23:26,076 --> 00:23:28,344
they would fear it!

328
00:23:28,445 --> 00:23:30,579
They accept an interpretation

329
00:23:30,647 --> 00:23:33,682
that a race of giants once lived here...

331
00:23:35,218 --> 00:23:37,519

(Both chuckle)

333
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:43,659
The fact is, Athelstan,

334
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,030
we have lost more knowledge
than we ever had!

335
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:53,569
These romans knew things
that we will never know.

336
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:58,307
Their pagan gods allowed them
to rule the world.

337
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:03,646

00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:54,106
It's the very fabric of dreams.

361
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:00,479
You can read them, of course.

362
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,384
(Dust scatters)

363
00:27:11,491 --> 00:27:14,693
Athelstan: Yes. Yes, I can read them.

364
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,237
King Ecbert: Good. That is why
I've chosen you.

365
00:27:25,304 --> 00:27:26,771
Athelstan: What do you mean?

366
00:27:26,873 --> 00:27:29,841
King Ecbert: Well, I've chosen you to
be the guardian of these books

367
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:31,176
and their secrets.

368
00:27:31,277 --> 00:27:33,778
I want you to copy them.

369
00:27:33,846 --> 00:27:36,748
You speak Latin; Not many do.

370
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:39,784
Your job will be to preserve these works

371
00:27:39,852 --> 00:27:44,923
and these... Fragments

372
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,425
for all eternity.

373
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:55,100
But if you ever tell anyone about them,

374
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:58,036
I will let them crucify you.

375
00:28:02,341 --> 00:28:05,343
(Seabirds cry out)

376
00:28:08,781 --> 00:28:12,150
(Water laps gently)

377
00:28:16,155 --> 00:28:19,691
(Oars stroke the water)

378
00:28:28,334 --> 00:28:32,737
Jarl Borg: I hope you were telling me
the truth, Rollo.

379
00:28:32,805 --> 00:28:34,873
Torvi: Why don't you ask her?

380
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:40,078
(Oars stroke the water)

381
00:28:43,249 --> 00:28:47,252
(Loud buzz of chatter fills the hall)

382
00:28:57,363 --> 00:28:59,364
<i>Man: Jarl Borg.</i>

383
00:29:02,168 --> 00:29:05,170
(Loud chatter)

384
00:29:10,443 --> 00:29:12,444
Ragnar: Please.

385
00:29:15,348 --> 00:29:17,882
Jarl Borg: Earl Ragnar Lothbrok,

386
00:29:20,453 --> 00:29:23,255
can I say, in all honesty,

387
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:29,327
a greater man than I am.

388
00:29:29,428 --> 00:29:31,396
I know I don't deserve
the chance you have given me

389
00:29:31,464 --> 00:29:32,831
to raid and work with you,

390
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:36,301
but I swear on my ring,

391
00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:38,169
from henceforth, you've no reason

392
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:39,704
to doubt my loyalty,

393
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:43,975
or my commitment to our common cause.

394
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:47,145
If we are being honest,

395
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:49,381
I can tell you that it was King Horik

396
00:29:49,448 --> 00:29:53,985
who argued for a renewal of our alliance.

397
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:57,122
As you can imagine,

398
00:29:57,189 --> 00:30:01,760
I was not, at first, enthusiastic.

399
00:30:04,463 --> 00:30:08,166
But then... Then I realized

400
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:11,536
what could be gained by inviting you.

401
00:30:13,372 --> 00:30:17,409
We have much to gain if we work together,

402
00:30:17,476 --> 00:30:19,844
and a lot to lose if we don't.

403
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:25,183
Even I can see that now.

404
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:27,285
(Chuckles softly)

405
00:30:28,854 --> 00:30:30,555
(Chuckles, pleased)

406
00:30:32,992 --> 00:30:35,460
Torstein.

407
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:37,062
Yes, my lord.

408
00:30:37,129 --> 00:30:41,032
Ragnar: Put Jarl Borg's men in the
barn which the servants use.

409
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:43,201
And treat them with respect.

410
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:45,770
Of course, my lord.

411
00:30:48,908 --> 00:30:50,875
Thank you.

412
00:30:56,415 --> 00:30:58,717
<i>King Horik: (Chuckles) Siggy.</i>

413
00:30:58,784 --> 00:30:59,984
I never once for a moment

414
00:31:00,052 --> 00:31:02,954
imagined Ragnar would take my advice,

415
00:31:03,055 --> 00:31:06,825
and invite Jarl Borg
to rejoin our alliance.

416
00:31:06,926 --> 00:31:09,894
As I told you, Ragnar is different.

417
00:31:09,962 --> 00:31:12,197
Whatever you think he will do,

418
00:31:12,264 --> 00:31:15,166
he will always do the opposite.

419
00:31:15,234 --> 00:31:17,969
And I wanted to thank you

420
00:31:18,037 --> 00:31:20,438
for what you did for my son.

421
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:22,140
You made him a man.

422
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:26,311
Do not ask me to do it for your other sons.

423
00:31:26,412 --> 00:31:28,012
I am not a whore.

424
00:31:28,114 --> 00:31:33,218
Oh, no. Just for me!

425
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:37,322
(Loud chatter fills the hall)

426
00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:47,832
Can you keep a secret?

427
00:31:47,933 --> 00:31:49,968
(Giggles) No.

428
00:31:52,138 --> 00:31:54,139
(Howling)

429
00:31:56,909 --> 00:32:00,945
(Music and chatter fill the hall)

430
00:32:08,988 --> 00:32:11,423
What's the matter with you, my love?

431
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:16,995
You don't talk, you don't smile.

432
00:32:31,277 --> 00:32:33,278
(Gasps in pain)

433
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:38,349
(Kiss)

434
00:32:41,987 --> 00:32:45,990
My love, you must do better than this.

435
00:32:48,194 --> 00:32:52,096
You know something?

436
00:32:52,164 --> 00:32:56,868
My wife has got the most beautiful breasts.

437
00:32:56,969 --> 00:33:01,372
I keep telling her,
but she doesn't believe me.

438
00:33:03,008 --> 00:33:07,712
She has the most beautiful
breasts in the world.

439
00:33:07,813 --> 00:33:10,381
(Music stops, chatter quiets down)

440
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:13,718
They're like Freya's breasts.

441
00:33:13,819 --> 00:33:16,421
<i>The breasts of a goddess.</i>

442
00:33:16,522 --> 00:33:18,323
<i>Man: Hmm...</i>

443
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,226
Sigvard: Let me show you.

444
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:22,994
(Fabric rips, knife slices through)

445
00:33:23,095 --> 00:33:25,230
(Gasps and shrieks of horror)

446
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:28,299
Sigvard: (Screaming in pain)

447
00:33:36,918 --> 00:33:42,189

448
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,658
(Horrified gasps)

449
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,760
(Hard thud)

450
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:50,764
(Blood drips)

451
00:33:53,301 --> 00:33:55,569
(Grunted breath)

452
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,005
<i>(Whispers fill the hall)</i>

453
00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:02,342
<i>Aslaug: The giant king's servants</i>

454
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,545
carried a trencher into the hall

455
00:34:04,646 --> 00:34:07,915
and set it down before the throne.

456
00:34:08,016 --> 00:34:11,585
They heaped it with hunks of chopped meat,

457
00:34:11,686 --> 00:34:14,822
and it reminded Thor that rather
too long had gone by

458
00:34:14,923 --> 00:34:17,558
since they had last eaten.

459
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,860
Ubbe: Thor was so hungry!

460
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:24,698
A chair was provided for Loki
at one end of the trencher,

461
00:34:24,766 --> 00:34:27,734
and for Logi at the other.

462
00:34:27,836 --> 00:34:29,970
(Footsteps scuff)

463
00:34:33,775 --> 00:34:36,310
<i>(Eagle cries)</i>

<i>Aslaug: At the word from the giant king,</i>

467
00:34:54,229 --> 00:34:57,798
<i>they both began to eat.</i>

_

469
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:04,171
Ubbe and Hvitserk: (Giggle)

470
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:07,574
Each of them ate as fast as they could,

471
00:35:07,675 --> 00:35:09,643
edging their chair forward,

472
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:14,515
and they met at the middle of the trencher.

473
00:35:14,616 --> 00:35:17,851
Loki had eaten every scrap of meat

474
00:35:17,952 --> 00:35:21,622
and left nothing but the bones.

475
00:35:23,258 --> 00:35:26,260
(Fire crackles)

476
00:35:31,533 --> 00:35:35,602
(Blade rings, Rollo breathes angrily)

477
00:35:38,373 --> 00:35:40,374
Siggy: Where are you going?

478
00:35:44,812 --> 00:35:46,813
(Door slams shut)

479
00:35:48,183 --> 00:35:50,350
(Fire crackles)

480
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,690
But Logi had not only eaten the meat,

481
00:35:56,791 --> 00:36:01,428
he had eaten the bones,
and the trencher as well.

482
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:03,363
Ubbe: I think Logi won.

483
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:06,366

486

Who is it?

487
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:44,938
Seer: Yes, I can see, and I see an eagle.

488
00:36:47,275 --> 00:36:50,377
<i>I see that an eagle hovers over you.</i>

489
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:56,719
But I also see that
you yourself are the eagle.

490
00:37:01,222 --> 00:37:03,557
<i>(Shuddering breath)</i>

491
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,500

<i>"that Loki is the loser."</i>

495
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:31,351
Hush, Ubba. Hvitserk is nearly asleep.

496
00:37:31,419 --> 00:37:33,186
Now you go to sleep.

497
00:37:33,288 --> 00:37:35,322
Ubbe: (Whispering) I don't want to.

498
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,291
(Whispering) Why not?

499
00:37:37,392 --> 00:37:38,892
(Whispering) Because whenever you dream,

500
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,429
you never know what is going to happen!

501
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,672
(Running footsteps)

502
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,714

00:38:00,782 --> 00:38:03,216
<i>Men: (Groggy waking murmurs)
What's happening?</i>

504

(Men protesting, banging) Hey! What?

505
00:38:07,422 --> 00:38:10,791
If you want to live, stay silent.

506
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:12,693

513
00:38:42,511 --> 00:38:46,013
Floki: Here and there. Up and down.

514
00:38:46,114 --> 00:38:51,052
Rollo: Where is Bjorn?
He is supposed to be with you.

515
00:38:51,153 --> 00:38:53,521
Floki: I don't know, Rollo.

516
00:38:55,257 --> 00:38:57,425
Rollo: Let's go.

It is fine, come.

520
00:39:16,311 --> 00:39:18,346
You can sleep here.

521
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:25,119
No, I can't.

522
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:29,323
Of course you can. Why not?

523
00:39:29,424 --> 00:39:33,894
This is your place. I cannot sleep here.

524
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,097
Well, don't you want to?

525
00:39:36,164 --> 00:39:41,369
What does it matter what I want to do?

526
00:39:41,436 --> 00:39:44,605
Well, what if I ordered you to stay here?

527
00:39:46,975 --> 00:39:52,246
Then I would have to... Heed your command.

528
00:39:55,651 --> 00:39:58,052
I don't want to order you.

529
00:39:59,621 --> 00:40:01,622
I want you to choose to stay here.

Ragnar: I am sorry,

553
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:51,233
that the ambiance of Kattegat

554
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:53,567
has awoken you.

555
00:41:53,668 --> 00:41:56,003

Did you really think that
I could ever forgive this man
