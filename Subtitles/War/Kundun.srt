Just like a dream experience,

514
00:55:39,673 --> 00:55:44,406
whatever things I enjoy
will become a memory.

515
00:55:44,476 --> 00:55:48,640
Whatever is past
will not be seen again.

516
00:56:31,651 --> 00:56:33,642
[No Audible Dialogue]

517
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,688
[No Audible Dialogue]

518
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:41,553
I will liberate
those not liberated.

519
00:56:41,626 --> 00:56:45,722
I will release
those not released.

520
00:56:45,796 --> 00:56:49,527
I will relieve
those unrelieved.

521
00:56:51,902 --> 00:56:55,338
And set living beings
in nirvana.

522
00:57:16,423 --> 00:57:19,483
## [Percussion, Horns]

523
00:57:24,231 --> 00:57:28,668
[Counselor] We repudiate
the Seventeen Point Agreement.

524
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:38,165
We constitute
a temporary government of Tibet,

525
00:57:38,243 --> 00:57:40,268
the only legal authority
in the land.

526
00:57:40,344 --> 00:57:45,407
[All Cheering]

527
00:58:19,112 --> 00:58:23,208
[Dalai Lama] The Buddhas neither wash
ill deeds away with water,

528
00:58:23,282 --> 00:58:27,616
nor remove beings' sufferings
with their hands,

529
00:58:27,686 --> 00:58:31,053
nor transfer their realizations
to others.

530
00:58:32,657 --> 00:58:37,458
Beings are released
through the teachings of the truth.

531
00:58:37,527 --> 00:58:39,961
The final reality.

532
00:58:47,736 --> 00:58:50,500
[Sneezing]

533
00:58:54,475 --> 00:58:56,409
[Dog Barking]

534
00:59:04,484 --> 00:59:08,215
- [Whispering]
- [Laughs]

535
00:59:08,287 --> 00:59:10,221
Shh.

536
00:59:22,734 --> 00:59:25,669
[Lord Chamberlain]
Hurry, Holiness. The Chinese are close.

537
00:59:34,911 --> 00:59:38,005
Hurry, Kundun.
They are close.

538
01:00:02,361 --> 01:00:04,795
[Monks Chanting]

539
01:00:10,302 --> 01:00:12,236
[Ringing]

540
01:00:31,019 --> 01:00:33,954
[Men Chattering]

541
01:00:47,734 --> 01:00:51,067
Kundun, you must walk
to India.

542
01:00:51,137 --> 01:00:55,164
We have won.
Come on.

543
01:01:56,193 --> 01:01:59,890
[Dalai Lama] Thus, by the virtue
that has collected...

544
01:01:59,964 --> 01:02:01,989
through all
that I have done,

545
01:02:02,066 --> 01:02:07,629
may the pain of every living creature
be completely cleared away.

546
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:20,811
With all respect, sir,
may I ask,

547
01:02:20,882 --> 01:02:23,043
who are you?

548
01:02:23,117 --> 01:02:28,555
What you see before you
is a man, a simple monk.

549
01:02:31,525 --> 01:02:34,392
Are you the Lord Buddha?

550
01:02:34,461 --> 01:02:37,624
I think I am a reflection,

551
01:02:37,697 --> 01:02:40,393
like the moon on water.

552
01:02:40,466 --> 01:02:43,833
When you see me,
and I try to be a good man,

553
01:02:43,903 --> 01:02:46,337
you see yourself.

554
01:03:14,062 --> 01:03:15,996
[Clicks]

555
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:26,105
[Latches Clicking]

556
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:28,337
## [Monks Chanting, Low]

557
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,953
## [Ends]
