1
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,400
Widersta_dskämpfer im Wald.

2
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,200
(gu_fire)

3
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,840
Feuer.

4
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,840
Hardly touched us.

5
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,600
- Bring my gloves, will you, Evans?
- Right you are, man.

6
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,080
Greiner, make a note of that flak tower.

7
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,680
(whistles)

8
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,080
- Well done, Digger.
- Yes, it's not bad, is it?

9
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,160
Got a light, old boy?

10
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:20,280
That, er, Jerry ammunition truck
made a pretty tempting target.

11
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,080
So did you when you broke formation.

12
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,720
How did l know
l was going to run into a flak tower?

13
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:28,920
- You know what l'll do, Gillibrand?
- No, sir.

14
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,720
l'm gonna recommend you for a medal.

15
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,400
Thanks very much, skipper.
l appreciate that.

16
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,600
When it comes,
l'm gonna pin it right on your tail.

17
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,360
Roy, what are you gonna do
on your leave?

18
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,160
- l'm gonna sleep for three days.
- Who with?

19
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,440
Me, l'm headin' right for Hyde Park.

20
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,120
- l thought ducks were out of season.
- Not the kind of birds l'm after.

21
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,320
- How about you, Scott?
- l'm going where there's no aircraft.

22
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,160
Group Captain Barratt wants to see you.
He says it's urgent.

23
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,320
Scott, take care of the debriefing.

24
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,400
What's up?

25
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,720
Thank you.

26
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,120
- Hello, Roy.
- Don.

27
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,800
- What's happening?
- We've got visitors.

28
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,560
- Sir.
- Come in, Barratt.

29
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,240
This is Wing Commander Grant
and Squadron Leader Adams.

30
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,560
Air Vice Marshall Davis.
Lieutenant Bergman.

31
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,320
- Glad to meet you, Grant.
- How do you do, sir?

32
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,640
Sit down, gentlemen.

33
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:52,480
Congratulations, Grant. l hear
today's operation was a great success.

34
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,040
- Well, we all got back, sir.
- Good.

35
00:08:55,159 --> 00:09:00,080
Anyway, there'll be no more operations
for your squadron for the next 17 days.

36
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,800
- You mean we're on leave, sir?
- No, l don't.

37
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:05,480
All leave is cancelled until further orders.

38
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,120
633 Squadron are assigned
an urgent, most secret operation.

39
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,240
Your men are going into training for it,
and that's all they need know.

40
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,680
- Do you mind if l ask a question?
- Yes?

41
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:18,720
- Why our squadron?
- What do you mean?

42
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,760
Some men have been on 1 2 strikes
in the last two weeks. They're pretty tired.

43
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,080
- They were looking forward to a leave.
- They'll have to wait.

44
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,080
All leave is cancelled.

45
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,600
Since you took over, your squadron
has attained high efficiency.

46
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,320
You can look upon this assignment
as a reward.

47
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,320
l'll try to, sir.

48
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,440
Now, for the operation.

49
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:46,440
As you know, the Germans have been
building mysterious concrete blocks

50
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,880
all up and down France and Belgium.

51
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,400
At last, Intelligence have come
up with the answer to what they are.

52
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:54,520
They're rocket-launching pads.

53
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,320
Yes, the Huns have got
a new operational rocket.

54
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,520
D-day is imminent.
These rockets could smash the invasion.

55
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,960
And they're ready by the thousand.

56
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,040
Why don't they use them? Fuel.

57
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:11,480
Without very special fuel,
these rockets would be so much scrap.

58
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,880
Now we come to why
Lieutenant Bergman is here.

59
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,520
He's one of the leaders
of the Norwegian Linge, the Resistance.

60
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,200
They have discovered the location of
the only factory the Nazis have at present

61
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,520
which can make fuel for these rockets.

62
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,000
lt's at a fiord iust north of Bergen.

63
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,800
Here's Bergen. Here's the fjord. It's called
the Svar_jord, the Black Water Fjord.

64
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:37,720
Now, as to the exact location
of the factory,

65
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,200
l'll let Lieutenant Bergman tell you.

66
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,520
First, l must explain
that the factory itself is not the target.

67
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,320
- It's not the target?
- No, the factory is bombproof.

68
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,480
lt is also sheltered by a huge cliff.

69
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,920
- Then what do we bomb?
- You bomb the mountain.

70
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,080
You blow away the whole overhanging
cliff so that it buries the factory.

71
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,520
l should explain
why you cannot bomb from above.

72
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,920
The Underground asked geologists
to study this mountain.

73
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:08,080
There is a fissure under the overhang.

74
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,960
lf you explode from below the entire
cliff will come down, or so we hope.

75
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,560
The only way you can get into position
is to fly up the fjord at about 200 feet.

76
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,400
The Huns have flak posts
at the mouth of the fjord.

77
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,160
At 200 feet, you'll be blown to hell,
which brings me back to Bergman.

78
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,720
At an exact hour on M-day,
the day of our mission,

79
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,640
Bergman and his men
will neutralise the enemy flak posts.

80
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,720
lf all goes well, Grant,
you should have a clear run up the fjord.

81
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,640
''lf all goes well.''

82
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,240
The factory will be
shipping fuel in 18 days.

83
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,760
Your special bombs will be ready in 17.

84
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:50,000
Today is M minus 17.

85
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,160
Your orders are to obliterate the target,
at whatever cost.

86
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,960
Any questions?

87
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:10,280
Lieutenant Bergman will work closely
with you. He knows the target well.

88
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,680
- What are we gonna practise on?
- We found a valley in Scotland.

89
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,640
lt's not nearly as tough as the fjord
but it's the best we can do.

90
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,640
- Barratt.
- Sir?

91
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,040
This gives you exact schedules
and routes to the training site.

92
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:26,040
Training to commence immediately.

93
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,120
l think that's all, gentlemen.

94
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,960
Oh, Adams. Will you see that Lieutenant
Bergman finds suitable quarters?

95
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,480
l certainly will, sir.

96
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,280
- Nice to have you with us, Lieutenant.
- Thank you very much.

97
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,120
Wing Commander.

98
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,640
l just wanted to tell you how pleased
l am they chose you for this operation.

99
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:55,440
l'm glad you are. l wish l felt the same.

100
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:58,680
You give the impression of
being able to do difficult things.

101
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,080
- l do what they tell me to do.
- But this is terribly important.

102
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,160
That's what they always say.

103
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,560
- You sound so cynical.
- Do l?

104
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,640
- You've not seen the Nazis at close range.
- Close enough.

105
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:13,280
ln the air, yes.
But l've seen them in my country,

106
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:15,480
torturing and killing innocent people.

107
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,120
- You wanna bury them under a mountain.
- Yes. If it will help win the war.

108
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,520
lf we're working together,
we might as well understand each other.

109
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,120
We'll do the best job we can,
but as far as l'm concerned, it's a job -

110
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,200
not the Holy Grail, OK?

111
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,520
- l will try to remember that.
- You do that.

112
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,760
- Climb in. l'll drive you to your quarters.
- Thank you.

113
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,200
X marks the spot.

114
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,000
Our climb is slow.

115
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,800
We'll have to increase
our approach speed to 290.

116
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:38,720
How are we gonna bomb the target
even if we get the right approach speed?

117
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,440
That's what we're here to find out.

118
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,600
Made eight passes already
and each one's a bust.

119
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,760
Skipper, iust let's sit this one out, eh?

120
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,960
Don't you trust me, Hoppy?

121
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,160
Like my dear old mum,
but this one's a bit dicey.

122
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,640
l thought you wanted to see Scotland.

123
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,440
Yeah, but not upside down.

124
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,440
You had a good day, Grant.

125
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,520
Not good enough.
l'll try it again tomorrow.

126
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,160
That's yesterday, today, tomorrow.
That's three days out of your 17.

127
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,880
- Perhaps you better take the squadron.
- All right.

128
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,200
l wish there was some way
to see that target.

129
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,920
l could describe it to you. Every detail.

130
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,560
Hey, wasn't Bissel an artist?

131
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,800
- rBergma_) The centre peak is higher.
- This one?

132
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:58,040
- Yes. And the cliff hangs over more.
- Fine.

133
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,400
- What's this all about, skipper?
- You'll find out soon enough.

134
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:06,440
l see. Sort of hush-hush.

135
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,160
Well, you're sure that's the way it is?
l mean, as you remember it?

136
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,800
- Yes, that's as good as a photograph.
- Thanks, Bissel.

137
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:17,480
Bissel. How you makin' out
with Mary whatshername?

138
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,960
Mary Blake?

139
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,280
Well, it's sort of hush-hush
but... we're going to get married.

140
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,840
He's out of his head.

141
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,120
- Don't you approve of war marriages?
- No, not for me.

142
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,000
- You don't want any attachments?
- That's right.

143
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,560
How wide is that fiord at that point?

144
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,640
Not over 200 yards.

145
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,720
What's on the other side of the fiord?

146
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,960
A lake. A large lake.

147
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:50,880
- What's that?
- A sailboat.

148
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,800
My sister Hilde and l
used to go sailing there.

149
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:57,320
She's in England now.

150
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,400
How did she get out of Norway?

151
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,480
We smuggled her out in a fishing boat,
just after our parents were killed.

152
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,880
- And your parents, Roy. Where are they?
- My parents?

153
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,720
My mother's dead. l haven't seen
my father since l was a kid.

154
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,240
Well, l have been more fortunate.

155
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:17,520
At least my memories before the war
were happy ones.

156
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,080
What did you do before the war?

157
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,880
l was studying to become a doctor
until the Nazis came.

158
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,640
lnstead of learning how to cure,
we learnt how to kill.

159
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,920
(whistles)

160
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,240
l will send word.

161
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,000
With all these reinforcements,
will they call off the attack?

162
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:34,160
No, not if Erik can help it.

163
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,760
There are many more Germans.

164
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,840
We'll spread ourselves thinner
and start 24-hour patrols.

165
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,080
Thanks.

166
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,440
Stand easy, gentlemen.

167
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,320
l summoned you because
l've had a message from Intelligence.

168
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,640
The Germans have moved in
another regiment

169
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,120
and a string of ack-ack vehicles
a mile long, right into our target area.

170
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,400
We cannot knock out another German
regiment. We have not enough men.

171
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:36,360
- You'll have to get some more.
- They will need training.

172
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,520
What about a parachute attack?

173
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,080
There is no place for them
to land or to group.

174
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,720
Commandos, then. There must be
some way they can get into the fjord.

175
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:48,080
There is no way. We have
discarded that idea a dozen times.

176
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,480
You'll have to send in more men,
whether they're trained or not.

177
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,840
- Could we have more time?
- There is no more time. M-day stands.

178
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,920
Well. In that case,
we will do the best we can.

179
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,160
- Well, Grant?
- l didn't say anything, sir.

180
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,560
No, but l could hear you thinking.

181
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:14,240
Under the new circumstances,
are you willing to go in?

182
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:17,880
- Are you asking me to volunteer?
- No, damn it. l'm not.

183
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,600
- l'm giving you an order.
- In that case, l volunteer.

184
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:41,160
- How did we do?
- Perfect.

185
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:43,920
l wish it had been
the Germans down there.

186
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,720
Try and match that.

187
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:52,280
Speed 295, dead on.

188
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,840
Altitude 200 feet and keep it low.

189
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,280
Peel o_ in this order:

190
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Scott.

191
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,840
Gillibra_d. Si_gh.

192
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,000
l don't know why you left that coal mine.

193
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:13,520
That's what l could do with now -
a nice, deep, cosy coal mine.

194
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,000
lf l make a mess of this,
you'll be deeper than any coal mine.

195
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:19,200
(Roy) Scott, peel!

196
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,840
Gillibra_d, peel!

197
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:37,920
Sta_d by, Si_gh... peel!

198
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,640
Now!

199
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,200
You fool!

200
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:54,160
You bloody Australian fool! l'm getting
married. Try and remember that.

201
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:56,960
How can l forget? l thought
l'd get the widow for myself.

202
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:01,320
l love your raw colonial humour.
Bloody Aborigines!

203
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:09,840
- Too close, Gillibrand. Pull up sooner.
- OK, skipper!

204
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,560
- Do you think they'll ever get it?
- Give 'em a week.

205
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,600
Hey, look!

206
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:24,360
This way!

207
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,880
(air-raid sire_)

208
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,000
- Thanks.
- What?

209
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:45,320
- You saved my neck.
- Well, why shouldn't l?

210
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,400
You're damn lucky they didn't get you.

211
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,800
Look out.

212
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,840
(all-clear sire_)

213
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,600
(cheeri_g)

214
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,880
Listen. There l was, with this
Messerschmitt coming in at 1 2 o'clock.

215
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,640
- l was out of ammunition.
- What did you do then?

216
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:48,840
l opened the escape hatch, reached up,

217
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,800
grabbed him by the tail
and pulled him down.

218
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,240
Ah!

219
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:02,600
- Now, there's a really beautiful sight.
- Haven't you seen legs before, you ape?

220
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,400
- Not like yours.
- What's the matter with you Aussies?

221
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:08,920
Don't they let you see girls
till you're over 40?

222
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,000
- They don't have girls down under.
- Down under what?

223
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:14,080
Here comes Rosie!

224
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:24,560
- l'll ask you to step aside, sir.
- l'll step aside if you'll step outside.

225
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,880
We'll live in Australia
and raise kangaroos.

226
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,320
- Don't listen to him. Marry me.
- Belt him.

227
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,200
- You wouldn't hit a lad with one hand.
- It all depends what he's doing with it.

228
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:38,080
- Come on, Rosie. l will see you through.
- A gentleman at last.

229
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,880
Here we are.
Keep you hale and hearty till you're 90.

230
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,400
- That's our aim, Rosie.
- Hale and hearty till we're 90.

231
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:47,680
What are those special bombs for?

232
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:51,240
Not what. Who.
l got it straight from the adjutant's Waaf.

233
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,840
- They're for the Paperhanger.
- Berchtesgaden? Wow!

234
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,960
One of these bullets
clipped me right on the hand.

235
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:01,640
This medic said
''Shall l take you to the infirmary?''

236
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:05,080
l said ''No, but you can drop
this off at the garage.''

237
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,080
(wolf whistle)

238
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,040
(wolf whistle)

239
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,200
(man) G___!

240
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:27,680
- That's for me. Just my type.
- Why do you think you'll get first crack?

241
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:30,080
Rank, old boy. Excuse me.

242
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:39,440
(clears throat)

243
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,680
l wonder if l might entice you
into joining me for a drink?

244
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,680
Erik!

245
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,600
(laughter)

246
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,120
Three years.

247
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,320
Sometimes l was so afraid
that l might never see you again.

248
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,320
- You know me better than that.
- Of course.

249
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,040
Now, let me have a look at you.

250
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,400
What a fine uniform. The Navy, isn't it?

251
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:09,240
Yes. Unfortunately a navy without ships.

252
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:12,920
l don't care. As long as
you're safe here and not in Norway.

253
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,640
l think, uh... l think we've broken up
the party. Let's go into the parlour.

254
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,800
l have so many questions
l don't know where to start.

255
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,160
- Some chaps have all the luck.
- Don't be silly. That's Lt Bergman's sister.

256
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:31,960
l've got a sister.
Would you like to see a photograph?

257
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,400
What use is a photograph?
Anyway, she probably looks like you.

258
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:40,320
Hey! Same again, Mr Kearns!
This round's on my sister, eh?

259
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,800
Hey, Rosie, how about some music?!

260
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,680
Who's next, then?

261
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:51,160
Oh! Welcome aboard, skipper!

262
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,240
Sit right here!

263
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,520
- What are you drinking?
- Whisky?

264
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,560
That's what we're drinking.

265
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,480
Girls, how'd you manage
to break out of the barracks?

266
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:14,560
- Roy brought a ladder.
- A little second-storey work.

267
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,720
You've arrived just in time
to make your party complete.

268
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,400
- Here's to girls.
- All of 'em.

269
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,240
- l haven't met all of 'em.
- You haven't met Bergman's sister.

270
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:26,840
- She's in the other room.
- Here's to one l haven't met.

271
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,800
- Go on.
- That is about all there is.

272
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,960
- That is how l got to England.
- Now you work for the English?

273
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:35,600
Yes. With an RAF squadron
as liaison officer,

274
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,360
but that's all l'm permitted to tell you.
But enough about me. What about you?

275
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,640
l have been working in the country

276
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:46,640
with children who have been
sent out of the bombed areas.

277
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:53,120
Oh, Roy. Come in.
l would like you to meet my sister, Hilde.

278
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,320
- Wing Commander Grant.
- How do you do?

279
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,960
- l was just drinking a toast to you.
- Thank you.

280
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:01,160
My brother has just
been telling me about you.

281
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,120
- You're the girl in the sailboat.
- Sailboat?

282
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,200
l was telling Roy about the times we went
sailing on our lake. You remember.

283
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,000
Oh, yes. l remember.
But l felt much younger then.

284
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:15,000
The last three years
seemed more like 300.

285
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:17,720
- You're a mighty pretty old lady.
- Thank you again.

286
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:21,960
You don't have to pay me compliments.
Just take care of my brother.

287
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:25,000
We take care of each other.
Kind of mutual-aid society.

288
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:28,880
- Roy, your drink's getting warm.
- Oh, yeah.

289
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,320
- Excuse me. l was just looking for you.
- l bet you were!

290
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,200
ls, uh... that his fiancée?

291
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:41,840
He would be amused to hear that. No,
l don't think he takes her too seriously.

292
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,360
Well, l feel he doesn't take
anything seriously.

293
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,240
But they're all like that. Different from us.

294
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:50,920
The more they feel something,
the less they show it.

295
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,560
Today in that raid, some of their friends
were killed and tonight they're drinking.

296
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:01,120
And you feel that he's dependable for...
whatever it is you're doing?

297
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,400
Oh, yes. Completely.

298
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,360
Morning.

299
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,360
Good hit, Gillibrand.

300
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,160
Roger. Out, skip.

301
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,480
Now!

302
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,200
Blue Leader to Jones.
You're up. Clobber it.

303
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,240
OK, skipper!

304
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:10,000
What went wrong?

305
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:12,640
Their luck ran out.

306
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,480
Blue Leader to squadron.

307
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:17,240
Form on Scott. Return to station.

308
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,840
(k_ock at door)

309
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,360
(k_ock at door)

310
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,440
tome in.

311
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,720
Sorry to disturb you, Roy.
l wanted to speak to you.

312
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,280
tome on in.

313
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,960
What's up?

314
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,040
- l've come to say goodbye.
- Goodbye?

315
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:33,440
Yes. Davis had word
from the Underground.

316
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:37,320
They have not been able to raise enough
men. They're dropping me in tonight.

317
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,920
How are you gonna get more men
if there aren't any?

318
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:43,600
There is a unit operating in
the mountains, just north of the fjord.

319
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:47,520
- l might be able to bring them down.
- If you can get by the German lines.

320
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,800
- Yes.
- Yeah.

321
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,960
- Hello, this is Grant. Get me Operations.
- Hold o_.

322
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,560
- l'll fly you in.
- They've already assigned a Mitchell.

323
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,120
l'll fly the drop.

324
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,440
Hello, Jerry? Get my ship on the line.
l'm making a drop tonight.

325
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,320
Right.

326
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:12,920
- You should not take unnecessary risks.
- Look who's talking.

327
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,040
l would like to see Hilde before l go.

328
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:19,320
All right. We'll pick her up
after l talk to Davis.

329
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,400
We'd planned on going to the party
tonight, the one for Bissel and Mary.

330
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,600
Oh, yeah. They're getting
married, aren't they?

331
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:31,440
lt's funny. Two die, two get married.
Kind of evens things up.

332
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,040
l thought you were against marriage.

333
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,280
l'm also against death...

334
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,360
but it happens, anyway.

335
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,000
l'd feel better if l could fly him there, sir.

336
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,160
l've ordered a Mitchell to fly him
in and make an arms drop.

337
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,120
- Could l fly the Mitchell?
- You're grounded until M-day.

338
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,440
- When did that happen?
- l've just made the decision.

339
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:02,600
Scott can lead the practice flights.

340
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:06,440
- What kind of a decision is that?
- You're too important to risk.

341
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:12,000
Yes, sir.

342
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:21,360
ls it all right if l drive him
to the airplane or is that too great a risk?

343
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,560
We'll take a chance on that.

344
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:26,320
Thank you, sir.

345
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,160
When the war is over,
we can take Roy sailing on our lake.

346
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,640
- Will you come, Roy?
- Sure, l'll come.

347
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,800
And we can go fishing, like before.

348
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,320
- You like to fish?
- Yeah, l like to fish.

349
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,960
Good. That will be something
to look forward to, eh, Hilde?

350
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,680
Hilde.

351
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:31,680
Adj$ da, Hilde.

352
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,880
Adi$ da, Erik.

353
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:39,640
- Take good care of her, Roy.
- Good luck when you hit that ground.

354
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,720
And to you, in the air.

355
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:25,600
All right.

356
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,520
Are you angry with me?

357
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:34,800
- Why should l be angry?
- You just don't seem to be friendly.

358
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,000
Hell, l'm friendly.
l just got a lot on my mind.

359
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:41,240
And now you've got me, besides.
Is that what you were thinking?

360
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,200
No.

361
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,560
l promise l won't be a bother,
but... one favour l have to ask you.

362
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,920
Let me know if there
is some news about Erik.

363
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:52,360
Sure. Give me your address
and l'll let you know.

364
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,360
l'm going to stay here
until l know he's safe.

365
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,600
- No, l don't think that's a good idea.
- Why not?

366
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:01,760
There are a lot of
hungry characters around here.

367
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,040
l think you do not understand.

368
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,360
Erik is all that's left for me
in the world and now he's gone...

369
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,440
Yeah, l understand.

370
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,720
l'm sorry.

371
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:35,520
(pia_o a_d si_gi_g)

372
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,840
Oh, pardon me.

373
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,080
- Happy days, old boy.
- And nights.

374
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,800
Rosie!

375
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:50,960
- Rosie!
- l'm coming.

376
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:53,360
Come on, love,
or all the bubbly'll be gone.

377
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,960
- How about these?
- Is that all you could get?

378
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,360
All l could get?
There is a war on, you know.

379
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,040
You could have fooled me.
l'm gonna get some more tin cans.

380
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:10,360
Sounds like quite a party.
Wanna join 'em?

381
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,400
No. l'm not in a party mood.

382
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:15,520
- l think l'll just go up to my room.
- All right.

383
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,720
You don't have to see me in.

384
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,880
l promised Erik l'd take care of you.

385
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,880
You don't want to throw me
to those hungry characters.

386
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,120
That's right.

387
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,600
- # Here comes the bride
- # Short, fat and wide

388
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:35,080
- Skipper, want to kiss the bride?
- You bet.

389
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:38,200
Hey, that's enough.

390
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,400
- Good luck, Bissel.
- l've brought my luck with me.

391
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:43,640
(si_gi_g a_d cheeri_g)

392
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:01,800
Don't worry. It's not contagious.

393
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,520
- You sure?
- Yes, l'm sure.

394
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,600
- Well, good night, and thank you.
- Good night.

395
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,520
- Oh, Hilde.
- Yes?

396
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,200
Uh...

397
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,080
- l've been grounded.
- ''Grounded''?

398
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,880
That means that l won't be
flying for a couple of days and, um...

399
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,360
l was wondering if tomorrow
you were free, maybe you...

400
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,560
lf you're inviting me, the answer is yes.

401
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,240
- Good night.
- Good night.

402
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:31,520
(stick s_aps)

403
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:43,480
Erik! Erik!

404
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,320
- It's good to have you back.
- Down!

405
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:41,200
- They haven't patrolled here before.
- It happened three days ago.

406
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,080
20 hostages were shot
for a bridge Goth blew up.

407
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,200
You had orders. No attacks.

408
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,320
His sister was raped.
We must bury the chute.

409
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:09,720
With all the German patrols,
it would be better to wait till dark.

410
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,600
We can't. The weapons must
get through to the other units.

411
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:28,200
Easy.

412
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,320
Slow down at the barricade.

413
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:39,200
Halte!

414
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,280
- Go!
- Halte!

415
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,880
Agh!

416
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:27,600
(gu_fire)

417
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,600
Over the bridge, l'll cover you!

418
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,840
Go on! Over the bridge!

419
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,960
Fa_g ih_ lebe_d!

420
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,600
Wo haben Sie das bekommen?

421
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:20,680
Wo? Wo?

422
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,960
Agh!

423
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:51,560
- What did you do before the war, Roy?
- l was a barnstormer.

424
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:52,920
Barnstormer?

425
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:56,000
Yeah, aerial circuses, aerobatics.
Things like that.

426
00:48:56,119 --> 00:48:58,200
Now you fly in the war.

427
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:02,200
- Do you hate the Germans?
- l never met any.

428
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:05,200
The only ones l've ever seen
have been through a gun sight.

429
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,520
Not the best way to get acquainted.

430
00:49:07,639 --> 00:49:10,040
Then why did you enter the war so early?

431
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:14,360
l had to do something. The air circus
folded so l joined the Eagle Squadron.

432
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,760
lt was di_erent with me.

433
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,560
Where l grew up,
everything was very safe.

434
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:24,640
Uh-oh. l got one.

435
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,680
- Bring him in before he gets away.
- Oh, no, he might throw the hook.

436
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,360
The idea is to give him a little bit of play.

437
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,360
lt's a sardine! It's a Norwegian sardine!

438
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,760
How'd he get over here?

439
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,280
All right, little sardine. Back you go.

440
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:46,400
Now, here.
Do you wanna take that over there?

441
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:48,680
Straighten the line out.

442
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:53,720
That's it. Get it straight now.

443
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,880
Hey, you're very good.

444
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:02,560
l used to do it for the fishermen.

445
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:06,440
And sometimes they even took me out
on the boat with them.

446
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:28,600
Hey, Don. You're up late.

447
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,200
Roy. They've captured Erik.

448
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,800
The Gestapo's got him.
They've had him since this morning.

449
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,880
You know what that means?

450
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,360
They'll work on him and they'll
break him down and make him talk.

451
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,800
This whole operation's in danger
unless we can stop it.

452
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:55,960
- How?
- We know the building they've got him in.

453
00:50:56,519 --> 00:51:00,400
Gestapo headquarters in Bergen.
This building must be bombed.

454
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:05,040
We believe that a single Mosquito might
get through tonight and stop them.

455
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:07,800
- You want a killer, right?
- We need a man to do a job.

456
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,960
You want a killer.

457
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,600
Listen, Roy.

458
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:14,680
Do you remember Charlie, my collie,

459
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,360
how we nursed him
when he was run over by a lorry?

460
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,520
But it was no good.

461
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:21,560
He was in pain, so l had to shoot him.

462
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:24,960
This isn't a canine love story.
We're talking about a man's life.

463
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:27,440
We are talking about many men's lives.

464
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,640
l'm grounded, remember?

465
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,400
That order could be rescinded
in the circumstances.

466
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:46,760
What circumstances?

467
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,000
lf you should happen to volunteer.

468
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:55,880
- Is there a choice?
- Yes.

469
00:51:57,519 --> 00:51:59,400
lt's a hell of a choice.

470
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:09,960
Who'll be my navigator?

471
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,040
Bissel's volunteered.

472
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:25,920
OK. Tell them to get my plane ready.
l'll be out in about half an hour.

473
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:28,000
We'll be waiting for you.

474
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,960
Get me the Black Swan.

475
00:53:00,199 --> 00:53:02,160
(e_gi_e starts)

476
00:54:29,719 --> 00:54:31,840
How are you feeling, Lieutenant?

477
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:36,120
Not very sociable.

478
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:39,600
Listen to me, Lieutenant.
l'm going to ask you some questions.

479
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:42,040
You will have to answer them
sooner or later.

480
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:45,240
You will save yourself
much pain by answering now.

481
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:49,320
What were you doing in England
and whom did you see there?

482
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,280
l was not in England.

483
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,920
Come, Lieutenant. Those canisters
and weapons we've found.

484
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,960
l know nothing about them.

485
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,360
You are insulting our intelligence.

486
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:06,680
We'll try something nearer home.

487
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,800
What is the location
of your Underground headquarters?

488
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,200
l have nothing to say.

489
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,360
Surely you will not deny
you are a member?

490
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,080
l have nothing to say.

491
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,960
l'm afraid we shall have to persuade you.

492
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:27,000
Take o_ his clothes.

493
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,880
Advise Intelligence,
one aircraft dispatched,

494
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,760
en route to predesignated
Norwegian target.

495
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,400
Yes.

496
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:46,560
l can be reached here
at Sutton Craddock Operations.

497
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,320
We'll wait.

498
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,680
He should be iust crossing the coast now.

499
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,200
- If Bergman talks...
- He won't talk.

500
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,000
We'll know soon enough.

501
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,680
Go on, Lieutenant. What else?

502
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,800
Well, Lieutenant?

503
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:40,160
(sire_)

504
00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:55,200
(sire_ co_ti_ues)

505
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,720
There's the building.

506
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,840
(gu_fire)

507
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,680
(bomb falli_g)

508
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,680
(Roy) Blue Leader to Co_trol.

509
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,760
Blue Leader to Co_trol.

510
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:17,840
The wheel's down, but one light's
showing. l don't think it's locked.

511
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:23,320
All crash crews. All crash crews
stand by for emergency landing.

512
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:45,960
Hang on, Bissel.
This might be a little rough.

513
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,960
Oh, my God. Bissel.

514
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:08,080
Hold it, son.

515
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:48,600
Get him out of there!

516
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,920
And you're quite sure
it was Gestapo headquarters you hit.

517
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,840
Yes, sir.

518
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,240
Then we can assume
that Bergman is dead.

519
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,240
Yes, sir.

520
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,680
Grant, it may seem ironic to you

521
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:05,040
but l'm going to recommend you
for an award for what you did today.

522
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:07,760
lt may have saved the whole operation.

523
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,720
Shall l break the news
to Bergman's sister, Roy?

524
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,280
l shan't mention your part, of course.

525
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,720
No. l'll, uh... tell her.

526
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:30,960
Gentlemen, l can't take a chance
on anything else going wrong.

527
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:33,480
l'm going to move up the operation.

528
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:36,240
Take off 0330 hours tomorrow morning.

529
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:40,200
- But, sir, what about the bombs?
- They'll be here tonight.

530
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,840
Adams, contact the Linge. Tell them
to plan their attack for tomorrow.

531
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,080
- Yes, sir. At what time?
- Daybreak.

532
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,640
Grant, you better get that wound seen to.

533
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,720
Sir?

534
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,760
How's a man going to be,
without a face and blind?

535
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:37,200
Awful, isn't it, sir?

536
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,080
l killed him, Hilde.

537
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,480
He was in the building...

538
01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:38,560
and l knew it.

539
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,520
You knew... they were torturing him.

540
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:48,040
You stopped it.

541
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,320
Erik cannot thank you, Roy.

542
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,560
So... l thank you for him.

543
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:22,800
Goodbye, Hilde.

544
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,880
Goodbye?

545
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:29,600
Another mission?

546
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,600
l will wait for you.

547
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:54,280
l'm glad.

548
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,240
Oh, Roy.

549
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,960
Please come back.

550
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:02,440
Please do come back.

551
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,800
We've got a date.

552
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:00,880
Now, the bombs you'll be using
are what we call earthquake bombs.

553
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And that is literally their purpose,
to cause an earthquake

554
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:09,120
which will bring down
the overhanging section of this mountain

555
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:13,840
and bury that factory which the Germans
have built there, under that cliff.

556
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,600
All right, gentlemen.
You may return to your seats.

557
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:36,200
Squadron Leader Adams will now
continue with the briefing.

558
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,120
This is the flight plan
from Sutton traddock.

559
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,840
By following this dogleg,

560
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,600
the chances of losing the surprise
element over the sea are reduced.

561
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:53,840
lf you are detected,
this route will lead the enemy to believe

562
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,440
that you're on a coastal shipping strike.

563
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,560
Wing Commander Grant, anything to add?

564
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,600
l'd just like to remind the men
that we will drop the bombs

565
01:07:05,719 --> 01:07:09,320
within 50 yards of each other,
at ten-second intervals.

566
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:13,120
The geologists calculate
that 1 2 bombs of this size,

567
01:07:13,239 --> 01:07:16,960
exploding in this pattern,
will break loose the overhang.

568
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:19,520
Skipper, excuse me.
l'd like to ask a question.

569
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:20,800
Go ahead.

570
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,480
lsn't it likely that each plane
could be blown apart

571
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:26,360
by the explosion
of the bomb in front of it?

572
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,760
Not if our calculations are correct.

573
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,960
Hope you've got a good calculator.

574
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:36,600
With those gun emplacements,
won't the flak be murderous?

575
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:41,480
The Norwegian Underground will attack
those emplacements at exactly 0630.

576
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:45,800
Which means that you should be entering
the fjord not earlier than 0655,

577
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,560
and not later than 0705.

578
01:07:48,679 --> 01:07:51,280
- Squadron Leader Adams.
- Time check your watches.

579
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,000
lt's coming up to 2.47 in...

580
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,840
five... four...

581
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,760
three... two...

582
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,360
one... check.

583
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,040
Your call sign is Everest.

584
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:09,120
The code for the successful completion
of the operation is Vesuvius.

585
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:13,080
Sounds like that mountain
could turn into a bloody big volcano.

586
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:16,120
Yes, and we hope
the Germans will be under it.

587
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,280
- Any further questions?
- Yes, sir.

588
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:22,320
l've got a question.
Just a bit of curiosity, really,

589
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:24,880
but what does that factory make?

590
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:31,320
You'll be told that when you get back.
This much l can tell you, though.

591
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:36,040
No squadron has ever been sent out
on a more critically important operation.

592
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,640
That's all, gentlemen.

593
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:48,680
Except... good luck.

594
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:50,960
Thank you, sir.

595
01:09:57,439 --> 01:10:00,160
Well, Roy...

596
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:01,400
What's that?

597
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,040
At last l got Davis's permission
to come along, without a command.

598
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:07,320
- You're a little late.
- What do you mean?

599
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:10,840
You haven't been on any practice
missions. We take o_ in half an hour.

600
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,240
l've studied every detail of this strike.
l know l can follow you in.

601
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:19,120
Yeah? Why do you wanna risk your neck?

602
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:23,200
l'm damned if l know, Roy.

603
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,680
OK, Don.

604
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,120
You can take Jones's place.
You'll lead Red Section.

605
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,880
Thanks.

606
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,040
How do you feel now?

607
01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:38,120
- Scared. And you?
- Scared.

608
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,960
(Morse code beeps)

609
01:10:55,279 --> 01:10:58,120
Johansen. Johansen!

610
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:11,360
They have moved up M-day.

611
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,920
They want us to attack at 0630 hours.

612
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,560
lt is time to send Matterhorn.

613
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,640
We are starting the attack.

614
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:12,400
Ambush! Ambush!

615
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,080
(machi_e-gu_ fire)

616
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:50,360
Landfall nine minutes, skipper.

617
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:52,440
Dead on 0703.

618
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:55,120
Right.

619
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:59,080
(Morse code beeps)

620
01:16:02,119 --> 01:16:03,680
ETA 0703, sir.

01:16:06,359 --> 01:16:08,320
633 Operation Control.

623
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:12,240
lt's for you, sir.

624
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:14,480
Davis here. Yes.

625
01:16:17,159 --> 01:16:18,920
What?

626
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,280
l see. Thank you.

627
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:31,200
lntelligence reports
the Germans ambushed the Linge,

628
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:33,800
trailed some of the survivors
to their hideout,

629
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:38,600
destroyed everything -
arms, communications, men, the lot.

630
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:44,040
- When's their landfall?
- (Adams) 0703.

631
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,400
Send this message
to Wing Commander Grant.

632
01:16:53,439 --> 01:16:55,400
Linge destroyed.

633
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,560
Enemy anti-aircraft intact.

634
01:17:00,359 --> 01:17:03,400
You have permission to abort.

635
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,480
(Morse code beeps)

636
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,440
- Hoppy?
- Abort.

637
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,080
Blue Leader to all sections.

638
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,160
Enemy anti-aircraft intact.

639
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,800
Keep your eyes open. We're going in.

640
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:37,560
You know, skipper?
l'm gonna recommend you for a medal.

641
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,880
And when it comes
l'm gonna pin it right in your...

642
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,360
- What?
- On your tail.

643
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:52,680
rHoppy) There's Norway.

644
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,880
And you can have it.

645
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:49,080
We got bandits up ahead, boys.
We got bandits up above. Keep down low.

646
01:19:26,439 --> 01:19:28,400
- You all right?
- Yeah.

647
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:40,480
Pull that extinguisher, Reynolds!
Reynolds!

648
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:53,520
Skipper.

649
01:19:56,359 --> 01:20:00,320
Blue Leader to White Section.
l'm coming back in to cover your run.

650
01:20:01,239 --> 01:20:02,520
Roger, Blue Leader!

651
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,040
Hit it!

652
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,560

653
01:20:49,439 --> 01:20:53,040
''Four hits. Three aircraft lost.''

654
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,360
''Two crews ditched in fiord.''

655
01:21:20,119 --> 01:21:22,600
You've got bandits at seven o'clock.

656
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,000
Dive, Clark!

657
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,520
Come on, Green Section.
You're way behind.

658
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,560
Bomb release.

659
01:22:54,039 --> 01:22:56,000
Bomb release.

660
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,080
Put it out.

661
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:12,160
Put the bloody thing out!

662
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,040
Break for the fjord.
Gillibrand, break for the fjord.

663
01:24:13,119 --> 01:24:15,800
- How many hits?
- Six.

664
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,880
Send it.

665
01:24:20,039 --> 01:24:22,480
- Won't that mountain ever go?
- Send it!

l'm going in on target now...

671

with an engine dead.

672
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,000
Now!

673
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:40,840
Skipper, it's going. It's going!

674
01:26:14,439 --> 01:26:16,400
(Morse code beeps)

675
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:20,960
Vesuvius, sir.

676
01:26:21,079 --> 01:26:22,800
Vesuvius.

677
01:26:25,279 --> 01:26:27,040
Let's get the hell outta here.

678
01:26:27,159 --> 01:26:29,880
- You lead and l'll cover.
- Roger, skipper.

679
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,560
Skipper!

680
01:27:49,239 --> 01:27:50,920
Skipper!

681
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:29,160
- Are you OK?
- Y... Yes, skipper.

682
01:28:30,199 --> 01:28:32,360
Can you move? Where does it hurt?

683
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:36,480
All over.

684
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:47,320
- l can't raise them, sir.
- Keep trying, keep trying.

685
01:28:47,439 --> 01:28:48,920
Yes.

686
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:51,160
He's coming on the line now, sir.

687
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,560
Davis here, sir.

688
01:28:57,159 --> 01:28:59,240
Vesuvius, sir.

689
01:28:59,359 --> 01:29:01,320
Complete success.

690
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:05,000
Thank you, sir.

691
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:30,240
- At least the rockets won't happen.
- They'll happen.

692
01:29:30,359 --> 01:29:34,880
But they won't start tomorrow or this
month or on D-day, and that's important.

693
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,040
Then what's it all add up to?
All their sacrifice?

694
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,320
A successful operation.

695
01:29:41,439 --> 01:29:44,920
But they're probably all dead.
All 633 Squadron.

696
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,800
You can't kill a squadron.
