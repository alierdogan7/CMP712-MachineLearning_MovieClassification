174
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,832
I'm sorry about that.
I mistook you for someone else.

175
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,074
So I gathered.

176
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,949
- I had been drinking.
- I gathered that, too.

177
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,157
- Mad?
- No.

178
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,665
- You're an American, aren't you?
- Yes.

179
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,249
Well, then what are you
doing in the Italian army?

180
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,582
It's not really the army,
it's only the ambulance.

181
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,374
It's very odd, though.
Why did you do it?

182
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,332
I don't know. Why did you?

183
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,749
Oh, I joined up in England.

184
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,657
Besides, the boy I was
engaged to had gone across.

185
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:57,165
- Where is Miss Ferguson?
- Why don't you go see?

186
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,740
Yes, do bring her out,
Captain Rinaldi.

187
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,032
- FREDERIC: Have some?
- CATHERINE: Thanks.

188
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,207
He's sore.

189
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,582
What for?

190
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,582
Because I'm here with you.

191
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,449
Women prefer him, as a rule.

192
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,782
Shall we take a walk?

193
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,657
Yes, let's.

194
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,040
Where is he now?

195
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,832
- Who?
- The boy you're engaged to.

196
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,249
- He's dead.
- Oh.

197
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,582
He was killed in the Somme.

198
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,249
Were you engaged long?

199
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,707
Eight years. We grew up together.

200
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,707
Why didn't you marry?

201
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:54,157
I didn't know what the
war was like then.

202
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:58,699
If I had it to do over again,
I'd marry him, or anything.

203
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,582
When I joined up,
I remember having this silly idea

204
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,415
that he might come to the
hospital where I was,

205
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,749
with a sabre cut, I suppose,
and a bandage around his head.

206
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,415
Shot through the shoulder.
Something picturesque.

207
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,249
This is a picturesque front.
Not France.

208
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,915
He didn't have a sabre cut.

209
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,490
They blew him to bits.

210
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,290
What are you thinking about now?

211
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,457
About whisky.

212
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,290
What about whisky?

213
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,749
About how nice it is.

214
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,957
And you're nice, too.

215
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,032
(CHUCKLES)

216
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,082
No.

217
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,457
- Why not?
- No, don't.

218
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,782
- Yes.
- No, please!

219
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,415
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?

220
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,874
It's all right.

221
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,782
I'm dreadfully sorry. Really.

222
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,074
I... I just couldn't bear the
nurses'-evening-off aspect of it.

223
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,582
It's quite all right.
I don't mind at all.

224
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,249
Poor man.

225
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,490
You see, I've been leading
a funny sort of life.

226
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,582
Besides, you're so very beautiful.

227
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:07,990
You don't have to talk a lot
of nonsense, I said I'm sorry.

228
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,615
We could get along.

229
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,082
- Couldn't we?
- (LAUGHS)

230
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,540
You're sweet.

231
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,699
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you're a dear.

232
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,199
I'd be very glad to have you
kiss me now, if you don't mind.

233
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,615
(EXPLOSIONS)

234
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,915
You are looking for someone?

235
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,832
- Have you seen Miss Barkley?
- Miss Barkley?

236
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:10,124
- Didn't she go out there with you?
- With me?

237
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:13,615
- No, no, no.
- But just a little while ago...

238
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:17,082
I thought I saw her go
out to the garden gate

239
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,207
with the Lieutenant Henry.

240
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,874
She went out with an officer? Alone?

241
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:24,499
Well, perhaps I was mistaken,
you know, it is quite dark out there.

242
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,957
Oh, she wouldn't do that.

243
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:29,115
No. No, I am sure I was mistaken.

244
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,032
Where is she, then?

245
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,374
You're a grand girl.

246
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,082
I'm a crazy girl.

247
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,582
- Why?
- To stay out here.

248
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:44,490
It's nice. Isn't that enough?

249
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,749
Hmm, it's nice. I suppose
that has to be enough

250
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,582
for people who are living as we live.

251
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,207
Back home, I'd have courted
you and sent you flowers.

252
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:02,699
Out here, you crowd
it all into one hour.

253
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:07,074
Isn't that the way it's
got to be, out here?

254
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,199
Look...

255
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,915
Tomorrow morning I've got
to go up to the front again.

256
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:18,282
And if a shell got me and
you never saw me again,

257
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:25,115
then we'd both be sorry that
we've been so formal and waited.

258
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:30,332
Besides, what's there so fine in
putting it off, dragging it out,

259
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,415
- giving me your lips tonight...
- No...

260
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:33,999
- ...your throat tomorrow...
- No.

261
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,282
No, wait. No, please... No...

262
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,282
Catherine?

263
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,540
- (CLAMOURING)
- Thanks for the lovely concert.

264
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,082
- I...
- I hope you are not worried

265
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,249
about Miss Barkley.

266
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,332
It's not like her to
disappear this way.

267
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,790
Well, perhaps she felt ill
and went home alone.

268
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,874
Perhaps. Good night.

269
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,282
Come, girls, come.

270
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,082
Why didn't you tell me?

271
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,249
It doesn't matter.

272
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,415
If it had to happen,
I'd rather it were like this.

273
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,582
I couldn't know.

274
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:23,082
In a church or out under the stars.

275
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:26,915
- Well, why not?
- "Why not"? There's a war on.

276
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:30,782
And tonight, who cares,
and tomorrow, who knows.

277
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,082
(CHUCKLES)

278
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,749
What did you say your name was?
(LAUGHS)

279
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,865
Stop it.

280
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,874
If you...

281
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:46,699
If you knew how I was back home,
you'd see the funny side of it.

282
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,749
Please, stop it.

283
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,990
(CHUCKLING CONTINUES)

284
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,782
Oh!

285
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,624
We blame everything on
the war, but that's rot.

286
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,490
It's something in ourselves.

287
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,165
(CHUCKLES)

288
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:13,199
The lady sat in the public square
and mourned her lost innocence.

289
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,540
Don't be sorry.

290
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,615
I'm not.

291
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:21,282
I love you.

292
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,449
Oh, darling.

293
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,749
Did you have a nice, uh, time, baby?
(CHUCKLES)

294
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,749
You made progress with her, eh?

295
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,749
We're friends.
If that's what you mean.

296
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,249
I mean, uh...

297
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,582
Was she nice to you,
practically speaking?

298
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,207
- Shut up!
- I am a man of extreme delicacy,

299
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,582
- but was she...
- Rinaldi!

300
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,415
Will you please shut up?

301
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,582
If you wanna be a
friend of mine, shut up.

302
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,915
I am your best friend
and your war brother.

303
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,115
Then shut up.

304
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:20,699
Miss Barkley prefers you
to me. That is very clear.

305
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:25,240
But Miss Ferguson is very nice, too.

306
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,824
You like her?

307
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,782
No.

308
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:02,999
FERGY: That you of all people...

309
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,415
A lot of geese, that's what
you are! Silly geese!

310
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:09,749
Stuffed with bunk about
woman's part in the war.

311
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,082
We must bring solace
to the men who fight,

312
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:15,699
sacrifice ourselves, give ourselves.
(SCOFFS)

313
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:20,457
If you'd known him for a long time,
or been in love with him...

314
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:23,290
But you only met him tonight.

315
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:27,124
How long must you know a
man before you can love him?

316
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,990
Are you pretending to be
in love with that man?

317
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:32,949
I think I am, Fergy.

318
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,199
I must be.

319
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,782
Or it couldn't have happened.

320
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,082
You're just another conquest to him.

321
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,790
One in a hundred.

322
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:46,115
You'll probably never see him again.

323
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,915
He said if he'd met me back home,
he'd have courted me,

324
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:54,290
sent me flowers...

325
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:56,365
But now...

326
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,865
I suppose I won't ever see him again.

327
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,824
(ENGINE STARTING)

328
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,124
Ciao, baby.

329
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,865
Good luck.

330
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:14,124
- Turn back.
- Back?

331
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,199
Yes, back!

332
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:50,165
- I wanna see Miss Barkley.
- She's on duty.

333
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:52,865
Wait, you can't go in there.

334
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:16,915
Hey, why have you come
back in here for?

335
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:19,415
The Tenente, he knows
what he's doing. Please.

336
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:21,415
What's wrong, Bonello?
Going to ever get started here?

337
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:22,832
We got plenty of time.

338
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:25,074
Oh, the...

339
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,207
I thought you started.
What are you doing here?

340
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:31,040
We come back, Signor Capitano.
Tenente forgot something.

341
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:32,782
Oh.

342
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:56,457
Hi. You're all right, aren't you?

343
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:58,624
Yes, I'm all right.

344
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:00,415
I came to...

345
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:02,657
I thought...

346
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,124
You see...

347
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,832
I... I'm going to be
away for a while,

348
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:12,207
and I didn't want you to think
that I'd just gone away.

No, I...

What I mean is,

351
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:18,457
I'd hate to have you feel that...

352
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:22,457
That it wasn't important
to me. About...

353
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:24,199
About us.

354
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:27,582
Uh, I don't exactly
know how to say it.

355
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:31,199
You've said it very nicely,
dear, thank you.

356
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,407
No, I don't mean...

357
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:37,624
- You mustn't feel...
- Will you be gone long?

358
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:39,207
No.

00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,915

Nothing much, I guess.

362
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,282

useful to guard you from harm.

He is my friend and a good soldier.

lose his head over a woman.

Aren't you exaggerating a bit?

372
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:45,999
I think not.

373
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,874
Couldn't we send her
back to the base, Major?

374
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:51,915
Oh, if you could send her away,
it would simplify everything.

375
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:53,915
Could perhaps send her to Milan.

376
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:55,749

Magnificent!

00:38:21,916 --> 00:38:25,407
I know. I could see it in your faces.

517
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:29,157
You approve, don't you, Father?

518
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:32,074
You spoke of children.

519
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:39,282
This, too, is the war. Without the war,
you would have married in God's grace.

520
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:42,407
Is it not so?

521
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,449
And you?

about it like that, but...

Is that the marriage service?

527
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:41,457

528
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:45,115

prevent us from marrying?

It was a foolish notion, perhaps.

538

I have not the right to
say you are married.

539
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:39,665
Yet, it has made me happy to do this.

540
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:42,624
For now, from my heart, I can
say I bless you in His name.

542

- Give my regards to the mess.
- I will.

And get well soon. I will come
again the next time I am in Milan.

- They threw benches at him.
- That's a lie!

Yes, they did. I threw six

- You can't. She's gone.

- And you'd better get out.

- Has she been transferred?
- If you don't get out of here,

- Why'd she go. Where? Tell me.
- No!

- Tell me where she is!
- Go ahead, choke me,

01:08:17,083 --> 01:08:19,332
but I won't tell you.
You've done her enough harm.

mixed up in it myself.

you to get some things,

01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:11,324
Doctor...

1028
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,615
Have I long?

1029
01:22:21,916 --> 01:22:23,999
Don't you see?

1030
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,115
I have to know.

1031
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:28,824
Not long.

1032
01:22:34,791 --> 01:22:37,115
Let him come in.

1033
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,740
No, wait.

1034
01:22:40,666 --> 01:22:42,582
Could I...

1035
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:45,407
Could I have my bag, first?

1036
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:57,532
Oh! Such a mess.

1037
01:23:02,416 --> 01:23:05,365
He never liked me to be pale.

1038
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,615
You can go in now.

1039
01:23:31,583 --> 01:23:34,282
- Catherine.
- Darling.

1040
01:23:41,458 --> 01:23:44,365
- You're all right?
- I'm fine.

1041
01:23:44,583 --> 01:23:47,199
Did you worry about me?

1042
01:23:47,666 --> 01:23:50,749
I came as soon as I
found where you were.

1043
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:52,499
Poor darling.

1044
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,949
Let me look at you.

1045
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:56,832
Ah...

1046
01:23:56,833 --> 01:23:59,949
Tut-tut. You're wet and tired.

1047
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:03,115
Sit down, darling. Here...

1048
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,490
You're going to be
all right, Catherine.

1049
01:24:19,541 --> 01:24:22,415
Do you want me to do anything, Cat?

1050
01:24:22,416 --> 01:24:25,282
- Can I get you anything?
- No.

1051
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:28,240
Just talk to me.

1052
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,082
Tell me you haven't
stopped loving me.

1053
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:33,824
You know I couldn't stop.

1054
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:36,749
I like to hear you say it, though.

1055
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:38,999
I'll never stop loving you.

1056
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,907
Never?

1057
01:24:41,166 --> 01:24:42,999
Not even

1058
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,199
if I died?

1059
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:48,782
Never.

1060
01:24:52,041 --> 01:24:54,749
You'd never do our things
with any other girl,

1061
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:57,540
or say the same things, would you?

1062
01:24:57,541 --> 01:24:59,165
Never.

1063
01:24:59,166 --> 01:25:02,499
I want you to have
other girls, though.

1064
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,790
I don't want them.

1065
01:25:04,791 --> 01:25:07,282
That's right, dear.

1066
01:25:12,416 --> 01:25:13,874
Try...

1067
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:16,032
Try to sleep, Cat.

1068
01:25:20,916 --> 01:25:24,532
When I get well, we'll...

1069
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:28,540
We'll take a little house
in the mountains.

1070
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:32,365
We always planned a house
of our own, remember?

1071
01:25:32,458 --> 01:25:35,240
I'll get you a fine house.

1072
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:39,157
We'll live in it until
the war is over.

1073
01:25:40,041 --> 01:25:44,532
Then you'll go back to America
and be a splendid architect.

1074
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:49,282
We'll be married all
over again. In a church.

1075
01:25:49,708 --> 01:25:51,782
In a church.

1076
01:25:54,041 --> 01:25:55,999
Oh, darling!

1077
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,415
I don't wanna die.

1078
01:25:58,416 --> 01:26:00,457
- Don't let me die.
- Cat!

1079
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:03,915
Take me in your arms, hold me tight.

1080
01:26:03,916 --> 01:26:06,415
- (CRYING) Don't let me go.
- Catherine.

1081
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:08,749
It's dark out there, and lonely.

1082
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:13,074
I don't wanna leave you any more.
I've been alone so much.

1083
01:26:14,708 --> 01:26:18,782
You... You can't die.
You're too brave to die.

1084
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:27,157
You're a fine girl. A brave girl.

1085
01:26:27,666 --> 01:26:31,749
Yes. I am a brave girl.

1086
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:34,949
Whatever happens, do not be afraid.

1087
01:26:35,125 --> 01:26:37,415
I'll not be afraid.

1088
01:26:37,416 --> 01:26:41,699
We've never been apart.
Really. Not since we met.

1089
01:26:42,125 --> 01:26:44,082
Not since we met.

1090
01:26:44,083 --> 01:26:46,249
And never can be.

1091
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:49,949
- Never parted.
- In life and in death.

1092
01:26:50,166 --> 01:26:52,249
Say it, Cat.

1093
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,949
In life and in death,

1094
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:58,449
we'll never be parted.

1095
01:26:59,041 --> 01:27:02,282
You do believe that, don't you, Cat?

1096
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,199
I believe it.

1097
01:27:07,416 --> 01:27:09,907
And I'm not afraid.
