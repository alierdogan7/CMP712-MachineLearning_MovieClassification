Yes, I think you should have.

348
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,520
You want us to pluck out his feathers?

349
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,030
And to clip his wings?

350
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,110
Hurt his feelings?

351
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,370
[Laughing]
[Von Talon] No, no, no.

352
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,540
Worse. Much worse.

353
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:44,500
We have ways of making you squawk.

354
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,340
[Gasping]
[Music playing]

355
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,760
[Yodeling]

356
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,100
What kind of birds are you?

357
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,350
[Yodeling continues]

358
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,310
[Screaming]

359
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,980
Must resist yodeling.
[shouting]

360
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,120
(Rule, Britannia

361
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,330
Britannia rules the waves)

362
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,670
One, two, one, two.

363
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,420
And halt.

364
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,260
Now fall out and report
to the nursing dock.

365
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,800
[Gasping]
Nurses!

366
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,640
Whoa, look at her.
Hello, nurse.

367
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,020
Well, I've been waiting for you.

368
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,440
Do you have something for a brave pigeon
about to go into battle? Eh, darling?

369
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,860
It just so happens
I do have something for you.

370
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,660
Oh, did you hear that?
[Whooping]

371
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,570
Is this what you had in mind?
[Gasping]

372
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,200
Ooh, it's awfully big.
[Giggling]

373
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,170
You're kind of short for a nursing dove.

374
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,420
Look who's talking.

375
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,920
I'd say you're kind of short for a carrier pigeon.

376
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,470
I'm Valiant, by the way.
All right, then, Valiant.

377
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,090
I'm Victoria.Ooh.

378
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,140
I know you lads have had a tiring day.

379
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,020
What you need is a nice,relaxing shower.

380
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,020
[Screaming]

381
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,860
[Screaming, groaning]

382
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,700
[Laughing]

383
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,200
Then I'll treat you to a fancy dinner.

384
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,460
[Sneezing]

385
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,420
Mmm.

386
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,010
[Belches]

387
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,680
We'll get you a feather cut.
[Gasping]

388
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,980
Set you up with some uniforms.

389
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,070
Oh, beg your pardon.

390
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,120
Did that hurt? Did that hurt?

391
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,540
That's it.

392
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,370
Ah!
[Growling]

393
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,830
[Muttering]

394
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,340
Then we'll all turn in for a good night's sleep.

395
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,550
[Gasping]

396
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,090
Ew.

397
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,970
So this is where the smelly, rotten
bits of disgusting refuse are dumped.

398
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,680
And our sleeping quarters
would be where?

399
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,940
[Tailfeather] I'll never sleep in here.

400
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,230
[Whistling]

401
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,520
Oh, ho.

402
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,150
Well, this isn't so bad. Oh!

403
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,200
Oh, just like home.

404
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,830
[Shouting]

405
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,710
[Groaning]

406
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,540
I've had enough.
[Gasping]

407
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,800
Speak!

408
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,470
Lieutenant Mercury,
Royal Homing Pigeon Service,

409
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,140
4-1-2-1-4-4-4-4-4-4-6-9-7.

410
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,730
Oh. Bring me the truth serum.

411
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,100
Coming up. Right away.

412
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,270
[Laughing]
Come on, come on, come on.

413
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,150
One shot of this,
and we will know everything.

414
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,570
I'll never talk.

415
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,990
Never! Never!

416
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,700
[Snoring]

417
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,250
[Bugsy snores]
[Flies wheeze]

418
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,420
Wakey, wakey!

419
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,390
You birdbrains are Squad F.

420
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,560
You know what that means?

421
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,810
Squad fantastic?

422
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,100
Squad formidable?
No.

423
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,730
Philosophical?
No!

424
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,190
It means you are the flyers...
[whooping]

425
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,360
...of the future.

426
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,860
[Whooping, grunting]

427
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,410
The far future.

428
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:32,750
But my job, somehow, is to make you
the carrier pigeons of today.

429
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,330
Ooh. Ha, ha, ha.

430
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,380
[Groans]

431
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,630
Good maneuver.

432
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,550
It might help if you kept
your eyes open.

433
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,220
Better get you back to your nursing dove.

434
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,760
Thanks, Bugsy.

435
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,050
You must really like it here,

436
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,850
because this is the third time
this week you've been to see me.

437
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,190
I wish you'd be more careful.
Don't you worry.

438
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:56,850
Where I come from, danger
is our business. Oh, yeah.

439
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,730
We spit danger in the eye.

440
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,070
If they can dish it out,
well, I can take it.

441
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,070
And where do you come from?
West Nestington.

442
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,950
That's near Nestington.
It's, um...

443
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,160
It's to the west of it, actually.
[Giggling]

444
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,750
Oh, Valiant.

445
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,870
Well, I have to...

446
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,830
...return to my duties, so...

447
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,170
Goodbye.

448
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,300
Valiant, wait.
[Screaming]

449
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,140
[Groans]

450
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:34,140
As homing pigeons, it's our duty
to transport messages...

451
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,480
...in the worst of conditions:
Wind, rain, sleet, snow.

452
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,070
Bombs exploding, bullets flying.

453
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,490
As if that weren't enough,
Mother Nature has the audacity

454
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,700
to create a little something called...

455
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,240
...the falcon.
[Gasping]

456
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:54,580
Twenty pounds of pigeon-eating muscle,
measuring five of your wingspans.

457
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,870
They like to blindside their prey

458
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:00,420
at speeds in excess
of 200 miles per hour.

459
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,880
But not to bite, not yet.

460
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,510
The first strike is merely for impact.

461
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,970
They'll let you drop a bit,
making sure you're defenseless,

462
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,390
then scoop you up
in their razor-sharp talons.

463
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,770
[Grunts]

464
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,690
And in the dark of the night,
you'll have but a split second

465
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:23,020
to recognize friend from foe.

466
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,400
Friend or foe?
Foe!

467
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,820
No, you idiots. It's a pigeon.

468
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,030
Friend or foe?
Foe. No, friend.

469
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,870
Friend, or maybe...
No! It's a foe.

470
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,290
[Bugsy] Ah, yes, yes.
Friend or foe?

471
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,170
Friend, friend.
Oh, yes, my friend.

472
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,300
[Laughter]

473
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,390
Ninety-nine, one hundred.

474
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,970
[Groaning]
One hundred and one.

475
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,060
[Grunting]
One hundred and two.

476
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,060
[Grunting]

477
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,310
To survive his mission,
a pigeon must have the strength

478
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
to carry his message capsule.

479
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,460
He must have the speed
to fly like the wind.

480
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,670
[Screaming]

481
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,170
[Whooping]

482
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,470
Evasive action.
He must have the agility...

483
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,060
Circle.
...to outmaneuver the enemy.

484
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,720
Figure eight.

485
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,810
[Sighing]

486
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,480
And he must have
the endurance to battle the elements,

487
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:50,190
flying long distances
over raging seas.

488
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,160
Whoa!

489
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,040
[Humming]
[Clearing throat] Me again.

490
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,120
Valiant.

491
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:05,330
Oh! Oh, my favorite.

492
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,880
How did you know?

493
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,220
Mmm.

494
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,810
The parrot says,
"How about we do a loop the loop?"

495
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,520
I said, "I can't do a loop the loop."

496
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,650
[Laughing]

497
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,780
He says, "Why ever not?
I say, "Why, I'm afraid of heights."

498
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,200
He says, "You?

499
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,990
Afraid of heights? That's ridiculous."
[Growling]

500
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,660
"Maybe to you, mate, but not to me."
[Snoring]

501
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,450
[Mercury laughing]

502
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,500
That's it, that's it.
Come on. Go on.

503
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,170
Afternoon, Monty.

504
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:51,840
Hello, Guts. What news?
Not good, I'm afraid.

505
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,140
We just lost Squadron E over Belgium.
[Sighs]

506
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,260
That means these new recruits
are our only chance.

507
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,060
Whoa!

508
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:03,560
They'll have to leave tomorrow.
You can't be serious.

509
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,230
They haven't even finished
their training.

510
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,560
Attack formation accomplished, sir.
[Cheering]

511
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,230
Yes! Whoa...

512
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,440
[screaming]
[Thud]

513
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,450
Ooh.
[Groaning]

514
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,780
Sorry, but those are the orders.

515
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,370
Have them ready at 1800 tomorrow,
Monty, old boy.

516
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,080
Cheers.

517
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,500
Commander Gutsy's here, so...

518
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,000
So... I suppose
you'll be shipping out soon.

519
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,300
I know, I know.I can't wait.

520
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,590
This is the moment
I've been waiting for.

521
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:36,840
Well...

522
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,050
I'd like to be part
of what you come home to.

523
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,060
I don't care if you're a hero.
Just concentrate on the getting back.

524
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,650
[Sighing]

525
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,400
Ow!

526
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,360
You need to understand
something, lads.

527
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,200
Our losses have been heavy.
Catastrophic.

528
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,580
You're all we've got.

529
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,460
And so, today,we fight for our country.

530
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,090
Tomorrow our feathers may be plucked
from our lifeless bodies,

531
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:19,590
our innards spread like jam on toast

532
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,260
and our bones fed to rabid weasels.

533
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,970
But never mind that.

534
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,270
On this day, in this place,

535
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,530
let it forever be known
that you pigeons did your part

536
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:38,820
in the heroic battle for...

537
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,700
S... Seeds!

538
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,490
Freedom! Right.

539
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,200
You will be Commander Gutsy's
support wing.

540
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,330
[Gasping]
I expect you to do whatever it takes

541
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,540
to ensure the success
of his mission.

542
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,300
Chaps, the message
we have been sent to carry

543
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,300
is of the almost importance.

544
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,800
The outcome of the war
could well depend on it.

545
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,600
We pigeons have never been entrusted

546
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,680
with a more critical
or dangerous mission.

547
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:13,230
May you fly straight,
and may your instinct guide you home.

548
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,030
What did Gutsy mean
by "highly dangerous"?

549
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,320
I don't know, but I can tell you this.

550
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,870
I am a bird of principle.

551
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,290
[Slurping]

552
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,710
And my number one principle is,

553
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:33,420
don't get involved with anything
called "highly dangerous."

554
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,500
[Slurping]

555
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,050
And I will never violate
my core beliefs.

556
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,590
Do not ask me to violate
my core beliefs.

557
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,930
You're talking to the wrong pigeon.
[Belches]

558
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,260
Sir, point of clarification, please.

559
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,600
Regarding the dangerous mission.

560
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,100
I've got a doctor's note.
Zip it, stinky.

561
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,390
Yeah, sure, I understand.

562
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:57,270
And I truly regret that I have
but one life to give for my country.

563
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,900
I'd love to die. Love to die.

564
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,110
Can't. Not Sunday. Bad for me.
Are you finished?

565
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,530
Not quite. Listen, maybe I'm not
that conscientious, but I do object.

566
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,580
Get back to the barracks!

567
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,250
Now!

568
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,960
Do I still have to go
on the dangerous mission?

569
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,210
Now!Yep.

570
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,880
take that as a, "Yes, I do."
Now!

571
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,890
Hey? Hey!

572
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,560
Where are you going?
Shh. Keep it down, mate.

573
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,480
I got some serious flying ahead.
Flying?

574
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,730
What do you mean?
Flying to where?

575
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,650
Back to old Trafalgar Square.

576
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,110
You're not leaving.
You'll break up the team.

577
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,280
Team? I'm not a team player.

578
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,660
Old Bug Buster plays solo.

579
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,370
Bigger question is why are you staying?

580
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,870
Why am I stay...
Because it's my duty. It's our duty.

581
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,290
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Hold on. Sorry.

582
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,750
Have I missed something?
Did we start this? No.

583
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,590
Did we make those?

584
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,300
Or those?

585
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,090
I've seen them fall, mate,
and it's not a pretty sight.

586
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,720
The truth is...

587
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,430
...I'm scared, all right?

588
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,190
Don't tell them that,
cause I'll deny it.

589
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,900
Well, I'm scared too.

590
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,820
What in come with me, yeah?

591
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,990
Trafalgar Square'll be ours.
Come on.

592
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,280
We didn't make
Trafalgar Square either.

593
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,530
Where do we go when
they start dropping bombs there?

594
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,740
No, no, I'm staying.
I'm doing my bit.

595
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,870
Yeah. They're lucky to have you, mate.

596
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,880
Anyway, keep your wings dry, yeah?

597
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,300
[Banging]Ow! Ow!

598
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,260
Ow! Ow!
What's happening?

599
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,260
Shh.What's going on?

600
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,720
It's time for me to fly the coop,
all right?

601
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,390
So... I guess this is... farewell.

602
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,480
All right?
Where are you going?

603
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,440
You can't just leave, Bugsy.

604
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,770
[Sighing] Look...

605
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,570
I've got urgent business
to take care of, and...

606
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,610
Look, I'd better catch the wind
while it's blowing. All right?

607
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,330
Look me up
when you get back, yeah?

608
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,330
You know where I'll be.

609
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,430
Gentlemen, take your places.

610
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,100
Our mission is to be dropped
behind enemy lines

611
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,600
in occupied France,

612
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,190
to make contact
with the French Resistance

613
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,440
to get a vital
top-secret message

614
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,990
and bring it back here
by sundown tomorrow. Good luck.

615
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:52,030
The fate of the freedom-loving world
depends on us.

616
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,080
[Whistling]

617
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,250
Oi!

618
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,250
Hey, hey, hey, Bugsy!

619
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,500
You can't go without me.

620
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,590
I couldn't let you get all the glory.

621
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,030
Good luck, lads.

622
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,460
Hey, Bugsy.

623
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:27,130
Thanks for coming back.
Ah. I'll tell you the truth.

624
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,710
It's the first worth while thing
I've ever done.

625
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,840
We're gonna be fine.
Right, Lofty?

626
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,510
Ah, yes, I...
[groaning]

627
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,680
Indubitably. Birds of a feather
and all that. What?

628
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,760
Ha-ha.

629
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,770
Right, Lofty, old mate.
We stick together.

630
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,440
Hey, Tailfeather, can you believe
we're the ones they picked

631
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,610
to send on the most important
mission in World War II?

632
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,770
Yeah!

633
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,150
Me too!

634
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,530
[Laughing]

635
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,030
Truthfully,
I'm not a good singer anyway.

636
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,620
Always off-key. [laughing]

637
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,250
Enough already!

638
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,210
You've been jabbering for days.

639
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,210
Who gave me the serum?

640
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,250
You want me to talk?
OK, I'm talking.

641
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,090
I'm glad you did this.

642
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:11,920
Homing pigeon racket
is all well and good,

643
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,260
but it's a stiff upper beak
rubbish all the time.

644
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,510
I've got feelings.
I want to express them.

645
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,600
Like, I always used to think
my favorite color was blue,

646
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,270
cause it's for boys...
[growling]

647
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,770
Shut up!Shut up!

648
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,520
[Groaning]

649
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,610
I demand better treatment.
The mice don't treat me like this.

650
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,780
Those Resistance chappies,

651
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,690
with their fabulous view
over the harbor.

652
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,240
The last time I was in the attic
in St. Pierre...

653
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,780
St. Pierre?

654
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,670
All the truth serum is genius.

655
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,630
Cover his cage.

656
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,750
I'm curious.
What is your favorite color?

657
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,510
Pink!

658
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,220
Not like a hot pink or a pastely pink.

659
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,310
Just a kind of... pink pink.
You know what I mean.

660
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,060
None of the rinky-dink pinks.

661
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,980
[Squealing]
Uh, excuse me?

662
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,860
[Embarrassed chuckle]
I like pink too.

663
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,990
[Flak exploding]

664
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,200
Come on. Chin up, Valiant.

665
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,370
Stiff upper beak.

666
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,040
Gentlemen, get ready to drop.

667
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,330
Are you ready to drop?
Oh...

668
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,710
I think I've dropped already.

669
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:42,050
It's OK to be scared, fellows.
I'd be worried if you weren't.

670
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:45,060
It won't get better,
but you'll get used to it.

671
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,980
[Whimpering]

672
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,440
Go, go, go!

673
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,730
[Screaming]

674
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,400
Oh, my!

675
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,820
It's jammed!
Oh...

676
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,830
Sir, let me help you.

677
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,620
No. Go now!
That's an order!

678
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,370
Yes, sir.

679
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,840
[Explosion]

680
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:26,260
Come on, Gutsy.Get out of there.

681
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,600
Oh, come on.

682
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,270
[Explosion]

683
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,500
Hello? Hello?

684
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,410
A little help, chaps?
Hold on.

685
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,670
We'll get you out now.
Cheers.

686
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,210
A bit of a tenuous landing, that,
but I daresay it could've been worse.

687
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,250
Look out.
Oh, my.

688
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,380
Sorry, Lofty.

689
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,010
Not to worry, old chap.

690
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,260
Hmpf. I say.
Bit of a muddle, this.

691
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,640
[Chuckling] But at least
we're all in one piece.

692
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,890
Not quite all.
Where's Gutsy?

693
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,400
He was still in the plane.
What do you mean he was still in the plane?

694
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,320
His cage got stuck.
I... I don't think he got out.

695
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,950
Ah.that's it.
We're dead. We're finished.

696
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,780
It's been a good run.
Nice knowing you.

697
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,410
You're quite mistaken.
I'm sure he made it out.

698
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,700
Gutsy always makes it out.
He's going to come and find us

699
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,660
and give us the plans
for the mission.

700
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,790
[Explosions]

701
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,550
Then, who has the back up plan?

702
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:43,130
You want the backup plan?
Um, we die.

703
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,760
That's the backup plan.
But I'm not ready to die.

704
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,680
Am I? No one's asked me.

705
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,890
So many books to read.

706
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:54,350
Regrets. Why? Why?
That's it. We're all dead.

707
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,110
Everyone, be quiet. Quiet!

708
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,110
We need a plan.

709
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,990
The plan is...

710
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,870
...is to find a safe location
to plan the next move.

711
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,990
You heard the bird.

712
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,750
So, our plan is to, uh...

713
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,420
...make a plan.

714
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,460
[Sighing] Come on.

715
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,680
France is spooky.

716
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,930
Vive la France!
Shh. Quiet.

717
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,060
Did you hear that?
There's someone in there.

718
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,940
Somebody better go
and have a look.

719
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,990
All right. I'll go.

720
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,460
[Screaming]

721
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,050
All right, you turkeys, let's go.

722
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:11,390
Valiant, just pull yourself together.

723
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,060
There's nothing in here.
Unless you're counting guns, bombs,

724
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,730
All the falcon. Pigeon-eating falcons.
Pigeon-eating falcons?

725
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,690
Oh.
[Screaming]

726
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,940
Oh! Ooof.

727
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,860
Let's get you out of the grail.

728
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,360
Thattaboy.
Come on. Here we go.

729
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,530
Thanks, guys.
Vive la France!

730
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:36,330
[Pigeons whimpering]

731
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,250
Pardonez-moi,
my pigeon friends.

732
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,460
You are the RHPS, no?

733
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,670
Um, yes, sir.

734
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,670
French Resistance,
Mouse Division.

735
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,590
Oh. Well, am I glad to see you,
I'll tell you.

736
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,050
How did you find us?

737
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,300
Well, there was the plane
and the explosion.

738
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,390
And the screaming and the pleading.
Um...

739
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:58,060
More screaming,
the begging, the crying,

740
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,230
the whining, whinging,
yelling, boohooing.

741
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,860
[Clearing throat]
Enough about that.

742
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,570
Definitely. Yep.

743
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:07,400
Uh, allow me to introduce myself.

744
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,030
I am Charles De Girl.

745
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,820
[Laughing] De Girl?

746
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,620
Why do they call you De Girl?

747
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,490
Because I am a girl.

748
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:18,710
The one and only girl.
[Whistling]

749
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,830
Oh, oh, oh,
I like France.

750
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:24,290
Do you speak French?
Well, um, mais oui.

751
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,340
Does ooh, la, la
mean anything to you?

752
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,220
Or va-va-voom?
Oh, yeah.

753
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,140
Does bonjour...
All right.

754
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,010
Look, we don't have time for this.

755
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,520
You have a message, we have a mission.
Let's get on with it.

756
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,100
Not so fast, monsieur.

757
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:41,480
This is Rollo.

758
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,900
He is an expert in sab...

759
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,780
[whispering] Sabotage.

760
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,990
Sabotage!

761
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,360
[All shouting]

762
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,030
[Laughing]

763
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,580
Rollo, not now!

764
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,950
No! Down! Rollo, stop!

765
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,910
[Breathing heavily]

766
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,750
Pardon.

767
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,380
Now, monsieur, before you
continue on your mission,

768
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:11,840
it is our national custom to...
Break the bread?

769
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,470
And cut the cheese.

770
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,680
Thank you, but we just
don't have time to eat.

771
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,350
And anyway, we're birds.
We don't eat cheese.

772
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,190
[Coughing] We don't?

773
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:24,850
About that message?
We will take you to it.

774
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:29,480
But the road is dangerous
and guarded by the enemy falcon.

775
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:30,820
[Coughing and gasping]

776
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:34,160
But this cannot be a problem
for highly-trained pigeons.

777
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,530
That is why you are Squad A, oui?

778
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,990
[Coughing]
The thing is, you see...

779
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:41,290
Squad B?
Not Squad B.

780
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:44,080
Squad C?
[Pigeons chuckling]

781
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,750
So then you are Squad D.

782
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,800
[Laughing] Just between us,

783
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,010
Squad D was never really
all it was cracked up to be.

784
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:53,680
I will not lie to you.

785
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,140
You will definitely be eaten
by the falcons.

786
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,810
[Bugsy belches] Wow.

787
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,560
That was some fine fromage.

788
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,560
Can you burp on cue?
Yeah.

789
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,270
I can burp on all the letters,
not just Q.

790
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,730
Watch this. [burps] A.

791
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:12,530
[Burps] B. [burps] C.

792
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,820
Shh. Be silent.

793
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:16,820
The falcons.

794
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,700
[Loud belch]
Oh.

795
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,200
Oh! I say.

796
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,080
[Clearing throat] Excuse me.

797
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,710
[Sighing]

798
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,710
[Sniffing]

799
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,010
[Sniffing] Mmm.

800
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:42,720
Come on.

801
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,940
[Gasping] Falcons.

802
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,570
All clear.

803
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,420
Wow.

804
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,850
[Gasping] Stop that!

805
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,850
Oh, Squad F!

806
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,480
We are here. This is invigorating.

807
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,740
The attic. There it is.
Fly, English pigeons, fly.

808
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,280
[Passes gas]
Oh! Oh, dear.

809
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,410
Sorry, love.
Dirty bird.

810
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:42,950
Lofty Pigeon, at your service.

811
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,700
Hold on, mademoiselle.

812
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,210
Oi,he's heavy, this one.

813
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,580
There they are.

814
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,630
[Screaming]
Faster!

815
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:56,960
Yes! Sabotage!

816
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,130

818
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,970
To the right!

819
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:08,810
Over there.
I am going to get you!

820
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,560
[Growling]

821
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:15,400
Aha!
Whoo!

[Screaming]

823
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,450
Hold on, my dear.

[Moaning]

825
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,660
This is it.

826
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,840
I must do the secret knock.

827
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:38,050
Who is it?
De Girl.

828
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,010
We must do the secret password.

829
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:41,720
Jacques, there is no time!

830
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,550
Baa, baa, black sheep,
have you any?

831
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,310
Oh... Wine?

832
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:49,180
No, no, no.
That is yesterday's password.

833
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,270
Cheese?
No!

834
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:52,190
Seeds? Petunias?

835
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,980
Falcons! Jacques, just let us in.

836
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,570

[Groaning]

838
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:08,370
Let me give you le message.

839
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,620
You can give me le massage.

840
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,870
Can we make sure it's
a full-body massage?

841
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,210
Message.

842
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:16,540
The message that is to go to London.

843
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:19,420
Our freedom depends on it.
[Banging]

844

[Banging]
[Falcons shouting]

845
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,800
And, uh, who will carry it, then?

846
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,430
You.

847
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,770
Wait. I'll take it.

848
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:31,600
Bugsy?
Extraordinary.

849
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,860
You said you weren't a team player?
We'll see, won't we?

850
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,070
Good luck, Bugsy.
May you fly straight.

851
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:40,360
And let our instincts guide us home.

852
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:41,820
[Fingers snap]

853
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:47,700
Pardon.

854
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:55,330
Goodbye and good luck, pigeons.

855
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,300
OK. Oh, farewell.

856
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:08,430
Mmmm...

857
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:09,930
Absolutely charmed.

[Shouting]

859
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,850
Just, uh, one tiny thing.

860
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:16,810
How are we gonna get out of here?

861
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,690
We're trapped!
Oh, oh.

862
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:22,780
Oh, I've had an idea.
I've had an idea!

863
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,240
[Growling] Where are they?

864
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,820
Whoa!

865
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:39,880
[Cackling]

866
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,220
Let's go.

867
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:55,850
Hey, it worked like a charm.

868
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,900
They'll be teaching that one
at the academy.

869
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,730
I hope the others are OK.
Don't count on it.

870
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,070
[Screaming]
Shh.

871
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:03,610
Evasive action.

872
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,540
Let's go.

873
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:30,010
[Screaming]
Get your claws off of him.

874
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:33,350
Ow!
I said let go!

875
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:34,930
I'm the one you want.

876
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:39,770
Oh, oh... Yee-ha!

877
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,570
You can do better than that,
you English pigeon.

878
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,780
[Screaming]
Bugsy!

879
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:04,340
Bugsy!

880
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,180
Dinnertime. [laughing]

881
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,860
Bugsy!

882
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,700
It was not easy, Herr General.

883
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,870
But I have...
[sputtering and spitting]

884
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,870
...captured their leader.

885
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,500
Leader?

886
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,170
Well, perhaps assistant leader?

887
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:47,840
[Groaning]
[Indistinct English]... Herr General.

888
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,840
Get on with it!

889
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:53,840
Oh, oh. May I present you with...

890
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,430
...the message, Papa?

891
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:58,890
Oh, oh.

892
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,480
The high commander will be pleased.

893
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:09,780
[Laughing]

894
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:12,490
There will be medals.

895
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:16,200
Und photographs.
Commemorative stamps.

896
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,120
[Laughing]

897
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,620
I will personally
deliver it to him.

898
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,130
They must be desperate, indeed,

899
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:31,970
to give the message to this
putrid-smelling reject.

900
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:34,340
[Fly whimpering]

901
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:36,510
Oh, Oh, no.

902
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:40,020
Dennis... You've squished...
It was my favorite.

903
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,140
[Sobs]

904
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:44,100
I am. That's exactly...

905
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,230
I'm putrefied, stinky, rotten.

906
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:48,650
Eat me, you'll be sick for a week.

907
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,690
Hmm. Take him away.

908
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,820
No, no. Listen, you can't.

909
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:56,780
I,I've got a doctor's note.
I've got a feather condition

910
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,200
Wait.

911
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,660
On second thought,
he may prove useful.

912
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,870
Yeah. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

913
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:08,880
[Kissing, spitting] Oh, thank you.

914
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,380
You're very wise.
What do you like?

915
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,670
Cards? We can play cards.

916
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,050
Find the pebble.
I've got a lovely voice.

917
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:20,060
(There'll be bluebirds over

918
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:23,390
The white cliffs of Dover )

919
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,770
That probably annoys you.
You don't want that one.

920
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:29,730
I was thinking more along the lines
of a celebration dinner.

921
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,990
Celebration dinner.
Brilliant idea. I cook well.

922
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:34,860
Not I cook well.
I won't be in it.

923
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:37,490
I can make dinner.
Bread crumbs. You'll love...

924
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:41,490
Oh! You haven't tried my
bread crumb birdseedy thing.

925
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,500
[Chuckles] No.

926
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:50,210
Pigeon under glass, with a lovely
Liebfraumilch reduction.

927
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,840
[Cackling]
[Gulping]

928
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,890
[Snoring]
[Gasping]

929
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:02,220
Oh.

930
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:06,520
Tickle.
What did you do to him?

931
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,480
[Laughing]

932
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,690
[Mutters] Pink...
You all right, mate?

933
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:17,030
Huh? Wait a minute there!

934
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:20,120
It's the feng shui.
That little bell should be over there.

935
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,490
Um, OK. Yeah.
[Giggling]

936
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:29,040
[Sighing] Who was I kidding?
I don't belong here.

937
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:32,170
[Exhaling] I've let everyone down.

938
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:35,460
Bugsy wouldn't even be here
if it weren't for me.

939
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:42,350
Chaps, there's Valiant.Look. Follow me.

940
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:45,470
Valiant!
Hey, Lofty!

941
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,940
Toughwood! Tailfeather!
You made it.

942
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,530
Chaps.
It's Gutsy.

943
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:57,780
You're alive!
What happened? Tell us what happened.

944
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,070
Plane exploded. Chute gave out.

945
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,700
Free-fall 3,000 feet.
Set upon by a pack of wolves.

946
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,040
Flew through barbed wire.

947
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,710
Picked up some shrapnel
from a stray grenade.

948
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:10,460
Fought my way to the rendezvous,
and here we are.

949
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,380
Right. We can dispense
with the chitchat.

950
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,880
I'm guessing the falcons
have acquired the message.

951
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:18,220
Yes, sir.
Where's Bugsy?

952
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:23,260
He sacrificed himself to save me.
The falcons got Bugsy and the message.

953
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:26,220
Which way did they go?
That way.

954
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,310
Oh, no.

955
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:32,520
(Rule, Britannia
Britannia rules the waves

956
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:35,360
Britons never, never, never
will be slaves)

957
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,110
[laughing]

958
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,700
(Rule, Britannia
Britannia rules the waves

959
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,620
Britons never, never, never
will be slaves)

960
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,740
Snap out of it.
[Grunting]

961
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:49,330
[Groaning]
Come on, Bugsy, old boy.

962
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:51,080
Let's find a way out of here.

963
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,170
Where there's a will, there's a way.

964
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,340
Right. You chaps sit tight.

965
00:54:55,460 --> 00:55:00,260
I'll fly in, avoiding the various clever
booby traps, and deadly ambushes,

966
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,300
then subdue any resistance
and secure the message.

967
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,140
Absolutely.
Gutsy by name, gutsy by nature.

968
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,740
I will bathe.

969
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,160
Bring me my best cape.
Yes, Herr General.

970
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:41,130
Da, da, da, duh

971
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,590
[shouting] Ow.

972
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,970
Join the army, you said.
I didn't.

973
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:49,100
You did.
It was your idea.

974
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,390
I've had enough of this.
Not listening.

975
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,940
Quiet. Shh.

976
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,310
I'm afraid it's not as simple
as I thought.

977
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:01,990
This is a highly-fortified bunker,
stuffed to the gills with enemy falcons.

978
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:05,610
There's only one opening,
scarcely big enough for a hummingbird.

979
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,450
It's down the barrel of that gun.

980
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:11,790
No, gentlemen,
I'm afraid it's hopeless.

981
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:21,380
I'll do it.

982
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:23,760
Valiant!
No!

983
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:55,790
Nein, nein, nein. Dummkopf!

984
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,750
[Grunting]

985
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,730
[Humming]

986
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:20,400
[Gasping]

987
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:24,400
Bugsy. [gasping]

988
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,490
Oh!

989
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:27,360
[Sighing]

990
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:29,910
[Distant voices]

991
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:46,670
Oh, oh, oh.
I'm too young to die.

992
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:48,430
I can't believe...
Hey!

993
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,800
Eh? Valiant.

994
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,850
Bugsy.
Shh.

995
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:58,020
[Von Talon humming]
Hey. The message.

996
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,690
It's in there.

997
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:07,190
[Gasping]

998
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:10,490
Herr General, a cape for you.

999
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,620
No, no, red.

1000
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,620
Red says "strong and decisive."

1001
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,710
Red it is.
Yes, Herr General.

1002
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:20,790
Yes, that's what I'm here for.

1003
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,540
No, no, wait.

1004
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:25,550
The blue with the eggshell trim.

1005
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:27,970
As many capes as you like, General.

1006
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:31,430
They're coming.
Gotta have this. Gotta have that.

1007
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:34,140
Valiant, get down.
[Banging]

1008
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:47,230
How many capes does someone need?
I'm sick of capes.

1009
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,740
I hate capes.
I hate capes!

1010
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:59,710
Ah. Um...

1011
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,830
Here goes. [gagging]

1012
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:06,380
Oh. Ugh.

1013
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:12,130
[Gulping, coughing, hiccupping]

1014
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:15,100
I'll get you out of here, Bugs.

1015
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,310
It's no use.
He took the key with him.

1016
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,140
Complete the mission.
But, Bugsy.

1017
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,560
I,I can't.
Forget about me.

1018
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,810
You've got the message.
Now get out of here.

1019
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:27,150
No. Bugsy.
Go.

1020
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,570
Don't do it.

1021
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:42,250
[Von Talon humming]

1022
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,090
[Clattering]
Underlingk?

1023
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,880
[Gasping] Uh...
Underlingk?

1024
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,890
Ja, Herr General?

1025
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:58,010
My beak wash.

1026
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:00,890
Ja, Herr General.

1027
01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:06,610

Cufflingk?
Ja, Herr General?

1030
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,370
My talon clippers.

1031
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:18,780
Ja, Herr General.

1032
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:23,040
[Continues humming
Ride of the Valkyrie]

1033
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,540
[Von Talon laughs]
Oh, I am magnificent.

1034
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:30,710
Of course, you can have as many
capes as you like, General.

1035
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,130
They're coming.
Huh?

1036
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:33,970
Oh!

1037
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:37,180
Get him! Stop him!

1038
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:44,520
What's going on?
Bugsy!

1039
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,060
Oh, yes! Brilliant!

1040
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,980
Come on. Last chance.
Get up. Get up!

1041
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:52,570
Oh.

1042
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:57,490
What is that repulsive odor?

1043
01:00:57,490 --> 01:01:00,950
Ahem! Not to rush you or anything.
We gotta go. Come on!

1044
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,750
Well done, my lad.

1045
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,790
You're from Squad A, right?
It's a long story.

1046
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:11,380
I'll tell you later.
[Grunting]

1047
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:12,460
Come on.

1048
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:18,760

1049
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:22,260
You idiots!

1050
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:24,180
[Shouting] Yeah!
Valiant!

1051
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,640
Bugsy, Mercury.

1052
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,770
[Whooping]
We did it!

1053
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:31,520
Valiant, you made it.
Well done.

1054
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:34,400
My dear chap.
And the message?

1055
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,030
Oh, yes, sir.
Safe and sound. [hiccups]

1056
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:39,610
Good man.
Thank you, sir.

1057
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:42,780
Right, lads.
We have a message to deliver.

1058
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,830
Let's make wind.

1059
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,340
Those falcons are gonna think twice
before they try to mess with us.

1060
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,390
[Cackling]
Enemy fliers.

1061
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:04,140
Toughwood, Tailfeather,
figure of eight.

1062
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:06,270
Disperse.
Yes, sir.

1063
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:08,390
[Growling]
[Whooping]

1064
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,230
[Pigeons laughing]

1065
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,190
Well done.

1066
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:20,280
Come on, lads.
Attack formation.

1067
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,700
Valiant, complete the mission.
You know where to go.

1068
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,540
Keep it tight, now.

1069
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:32,710
Let's go, chaps.
Come on.

1070
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,500
[Shouting]

1071
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:54,020
[Chuckling]

1072
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,570
[Buoy bell ringing]

1073
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:58,400
[Panting]

1074
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:02,740
You look tired, little bird.

1075
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:06,490
Wouldn't you like a rest...
in my belly?

1076
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:09,540
So... [laughing]

1077
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:12,040
...you are the elite, huh?

1078
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:15,340
The best of the best? [laughing]

1079
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:18,090
There's more to me
than meets your eye.

1080
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,550
Ahh!

1081
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,210
I hope I'm gonna make it.

1082
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:57,420
I think I'm gonna make it.
I'm going to make it.

1083
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:01,210
[Laughing]
[Shrieking]

1084
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,780
You can't escape me, pigeon.

1085
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:24,490
No!

1086
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,970
[Snarling]
[Screaming]

1087
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:51,350
What do you do
with a drunken sailor

1088
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:54,680
Early in the morning

1089
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:58,980
Valiant, back so soon?
And alive!

1090
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:02,030
Excitable boy. [gasping]

1091
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,160
What the... Falcon!

1092
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:09,490
Sound the alarm!

1093
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,700
Oh, my peg leg...

1094
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,500
Sound the alarm!

1095
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,170
Mum!
Valiant!

1096
01:05:21,170 --> 01:05:23,340
Hi!
[Screaming]

1097
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,210
[Growling]

1098
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:27,220
[Cackling]

1099
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,560
[Valiant screams]

1100
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:40,860
[Breathing heavily]

1101
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,020
Hmmm.

1102
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,610
Huh?
[Gasping]

1103
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:01,630
It's just you and me now, pigeon.

1104
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:04,380
This is where it ends.

1105
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:08,130
You are nothing
but a lowly wood pigeon.

1106
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,680
You are no match
for a falcon ruler.

1107
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:19,270
Oh, it's just as I imagined!

1108
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:20,940
Pieces and shreds!

1109
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,940
Valiant!

1110
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:24,570
[Grunting]

1111
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:30,110
Come on. Come on, then.

1112
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:35,240
You great ugly bully!
Leave him alone, you ugly falcon!

1113
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:05,730
Come out, little birdie.

1114
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:10,400
I may even spare your puny little life.

1115
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:20,080
Just stay calm.
You can do this.

1116
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:24,630
[Growling]

1117
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:36,890
Pipsqueak!

1118
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:41,230
My name is not Pipsqueak.
My name is Valiant!

1119
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:44,690
Oh, ow, ow, ow!

1120
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,320
Valiant.
Good lad!

1121
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:52,610
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a message to deliver.

1122
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:56,410
Oh, wonderful!
That's my boy!

1123
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,300
Valiant? You've made it?

1124
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,060
Valiant Pigeon. [panting]

1125
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,930
Sir, I have a message to deliver.

1126
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:27,110
[Gagging]

1127
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:51,340
Certainly, yes.
Just one moment.

1128
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:56,300
Gentlemen, a change of plan.
We now land in Normandy.

1129
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:59,890
A change of plan
Normandy. Repeat: Normandy.

1130
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:02,850
[Fanfare]

1131
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:05,270
[Cheering]
[Sarge] Well done, son.

1132
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:09,270
This could mean promotion.
I'm proud of you.

1133
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:11,690
You're a credit to the service.
Thank you, sir.

1134
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:13,440
Ow!
It's been a... I'm sorry!

1135
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,820
Sorry, sorry.

1136
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,490
Valiant.
Well done, old boy.

1137
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:18,740
I knew you'd do it.

1138
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:20,030
Well done, mate.

1139
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:23,370
Seeds!

1140
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,460
(Shoo, shoo, shoo, baby)

1141
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:34,670
(Bye, bye, bye, baby)
Ahoy there, Valiant.

1142
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,760
Bug juice, on the house, of course.

1143
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,590
(Don't cry, baby)

1144
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,350
I'm the hero around here.

1145
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:45,270
I'm the hero. Do you want to see...
Will you shut up?

1146
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:47,350
I was doing all right
till you came over.

1147
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,390
[Both grunting]

1148
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:53,690
Hello, handsome.
I say.

1149
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:56,780
[Singing continues]

1150
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:04,790
Whoa!

1151
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,410
Shall we shake a tail feather?
Certainly.

1152
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,670
Oh, Sergeant.

1153
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:13,040
Valiant, maybe you and I could, uh...

1154
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:14,840
Sorry, but I'm not available.

1155
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:20,970
[Clearing throat]
I can't stress enough how available I am.

1156
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,430
(Doo-dah doo-day)

1157
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:26,310
(Shoo, baby)
(Doo-dah doo-day)

1158
01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:29,850
(Shoo, baby Shoo, shoo, shoo)

1159
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:34,570
(Well, I want a little bit
of quiet in the house please)

1160

of quiet in the house)

(So don't you cry and don't you sigh
Goodbye now)

(Goodbye, baby)
Don't you cry no more

1166
