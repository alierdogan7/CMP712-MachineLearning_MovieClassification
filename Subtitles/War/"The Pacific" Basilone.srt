1
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,313
(theme music playing)

2
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:12,107
(animals chittering,
screeching)

3
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,762
(distant screech)

4
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,493
You see Briggs?
His men?

5
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,245
No, sir.

6
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,250
- (machine-gun fire)
- Man: Hold that front.

7
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,876
Man #2:
Guard that front.

8
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,106
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

9
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,066
Cease fire.

10
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,201
Break 'em down.

11
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,759
- Man: Give 'em the damn password.
- Man #2: Lorelei, Lorelei.

12
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,096
- Man #3: Cover the rear.
- Man #4: Make a hole, make a hole.

13
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,021
Morgan:
Jesus Christ.

14
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,815
Fuckers really are sneaky.

15
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,406
Hey.

16
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,700
Are you hit?

17
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,455
No.

18
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,769
Chesty wants your squad to hang back

19
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,312
with Able Company,
see if the Nips follow us.

20
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,314
Then we'll rejoin
the battalion further north.

21
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,940
Yeah.

22
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,533
- JP?
- Yeah?

23
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,910
- Set up on that trail.
- On it.

24
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,038
Manny, hand that piece
to Garland and dig in next to me and Mo.

25
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,707
Come on, let's go.
Deploy.

26
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,876
Man:
You heard him. Let's go, let's go.

27
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,887
- Evans, on me.
- Yes, Sergeant.

28
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,390
(thunder rumbling)

29
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,726
Supper's on.
Supper's on.

30
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,895
Got anything good?

31
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:41,066
- What are those?
- Army rations from 1918.

32
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,654
Quartermaster
over in Dog Company

33
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,781
claims they're edible.

34
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,538
After you suck on them
for about an hour or two.

35
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,249
This is all
you could find?

36
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,084
You fuckin' forage
next time.

37
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,549
Hey, who you
writing to, Leckie?

38
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,385
Is it a broad?

39
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,970
Runner:
Aw, come on, Leckie.

40
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,513
Read it.

41
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,558
I'd do it for you.

42
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,480
- "Dear Vera..."
- I knew it. It's a broad.

43
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,733
"Dear Vera,
it's raining.

44
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,861
I'm entertaining Runner
by reading this letter.

45
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:29,114
Can't wait to see you
and ever so slowly

46
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,866
strip you of your..."

47
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,327
You don't need
to hear that part.

48
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,538
Oh, that's precisely
what I need to hear.

49
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,707
Tell her
how handsome I am.

50
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,709
I'm gonna tell her
the truth.

51
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,711
We've been swallowed
by the jungle

52
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,630
and 5,000 Japs
waiting to kill us.

53
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,175
(thunder rumbling)

54
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,805
Hey, thanks for
brightening the mood.

55
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,058
Oh, I do what I can.

56
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,317
(men talking on radio)

57
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,656
Man:
...unless it's somebody with BO.

58
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,408
That's really dismal.

59
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,993
Man #2:
Yes, and the most dismal thing

60
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,786
- about BO is...
- (flies buzzing)

61
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,706
Man:
Keep that line moving. Let's go.

62
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,666
Man:
...especially the ladies.

63
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,710
Woman:
Well, Mr. May, the ladies know

64
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,004
how easy my pancakes
are to make.

65
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,839
Turn that shit off.

66
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,842
I don't wanna hear
about BO and pancakes.

67
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,802
I don't answer
to you, Morgan.

68
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,387
- What?
- Shove it.

69
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,223
- What?
- Whoa whoa whoa.

70
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,141
- Man: Tear his head off.
- Get the fuck off me.

71
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,893
Relax relax.

72
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,811
Man: Yeah, rice.
Just what I was hoping for.

73
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,688
What do you got
against Aunt Jemima?

74
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,650
Jap navy sails up and down
this slot every night and plasters us.

75
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,235
That don't got nothing
to do with her.

76
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,320
The only radio reports
I wanna hear

77
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,906
is that a bunch of Jap ships
have been sunk somewhere

78
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,908
off some crappy island
called Guadalcanal.

79
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,493
But we'd need the Navy
for that, wouldn't we?

80
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,412
- So fat chance.
- Come on. Hey hey.

81
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,748
So the Japs
got us surrounded.

82
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,375
Is that
what's buggin' you?

83
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,461
John, I shit like 20 times a day.
My ass is killing me.

84
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,837
JP's in a bad mood,
Manny.

85
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,923
Next he'll be complaining
about the mosquitoes.

86
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,508
Come here.

87
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,552
Hot chow'll
cheer you up.

88
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,896
Think of it as meat.

89
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,358
- Fuck it.
- Next.

90
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,738
Puller: Boys, Division just translated
some Jap newspapers

91
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,325
that was found on the other side
of the Matanikau.

92
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,828
Would you care to know
what the Nips think of us?

93
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,371
Men:
Yes, sir.

94
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,833
"The Americans
on this island

95
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:49,838
are not ordinary troops,
but Marines,

96
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,425
a special force
recruited from jails

97
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,094
and insane asylums
for bloodlust."

98
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,763
(laughter, cheering)

99
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,349
- They got that right.
- (men laugh)

100
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,685
Puller:
I got some more good news.

101
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,188
Rumors that they would never get here
are to the contrary.

102
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,898
The Army just landed.

103
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,568
- (men grumbling)
- I know, I know.

104
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:15,322
I want every man
in my battalion shaved by 1600.

105
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,948
Men:
Yes, sir.

106
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,909
I guess there ain't nothing much we can do
about our dungarees.

107
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:25,665
I figure we're just
raggedy-ass Marines.

108
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,336
- We look this way for a reason.
- Yes, sir.

109
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,465
We can't do it
if they don't run.

110
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,134
Jesus Christ, Evans,
you sound like my fucking wife.

111
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,137
- Kinda looks like her too, huh?
- A little bit.

112
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,764
Basilone:
What's this? Hey.

113
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,892
- Hey, whoa. Hey hey hey!
- Whoa whoa whoa!

114
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,769
Hey, fuck you!

115
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,563
- Fuck you guys.
- Put your face right fuckin' here.

116
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,982
- Thanks for coming, guys.
- Fuckin' Army.

117
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,861
- Just fuckin' wait.
- (men chuckle)

118
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,949
- (voices overlapping)
- Man: Get in here.

119
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,579
(air-raid sirens blaring)

120
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,457
(bombs thudding)

121
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,798
- (men shouting)
- (machine-gun fire)

122
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,508
See, Evans?

123
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,885
The Army don't know
the Japs bomb the airfield,

124
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,471
but not the beach.

125
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,723
Stay low, get greedy.

126
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,226
Let's go.
Come on.

127
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,937
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Over here, over here.

128
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,439
Basilone:
Grab it, just grab it.

129
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,775
- Hey, Manny. Over here, Manny.
- Come on, come on.

130
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,151
Man:
Give me some stuff.

131
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,195
Man #2:
Fill it up. Let's go.

132
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,406
Man #3:
Jackpot, boys!

133
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,408
Look at this!

134
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,287
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

135
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:48,081
Come on, JP,
get it in the bag.

136
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,500
Get it in, get it in.
Come on, JP, come on.

137
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,960
JP, make sure
you get those cherries.

138
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,420
- Hurry.
- I got the cherries.

139
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,964
Man:
Hey, give me a hand.

140
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,680
- Man: Let's go.
- Man #2: Can't get it open.

141
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,266
- Man #3: Doesn't matter, any of it.
- Man #4: Hey, grab this.

142
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,727
Man #3:
Throw it in there.

143
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:12,063
- Man: Pop that locker.
- Man #5: I got it. I'm trying.

144
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,775
Man:
Get moving!

145
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,032
Army gets the new stuff
and we fight with shit

146
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,701
my grandfather used.

147
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,746
Hey, guys!
Look what I got.

148
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,832
Hah!
Crackers.

149
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,876
- Look at this. Give me a hand.
- I got it.

150
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,003
- Hey, you there, halt!
- Man: MP, MP!

151
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,921
- Let's go, come on!
- M. P: I said halt!

152
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,798
- Come on, JP.
- M. P: Halt!

153
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,384
Stop right there.
That's Army gear. Halt!

154
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,136
(laughing, whooping)

155
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,889
- Try and catch us.
- Thanks for the chow.

156
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,603
Here.

157
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,772
There you go.

158
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,280
- Private Leckie.
- Sir.

159
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,908
The Army captain
from the 164th's raising hell

160
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,910
about somebody
breaking into his trunk

161
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:09,746
and stealing a box of cigars
and shoes.

162
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,372
Not just any shoes.

163
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,666
Said they were his favorite pair
of moccasins.

164
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:22,926
Well, that's bad luck
for that captain.

165
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,261
Yeah, well, you might
wanna watch where you wear those

166
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,139
or smoke any cigars
you might not have.

167
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,148
Or drink any hooch
you might not have.

168
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,777
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

169
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,073
Anything happen
while I was prospecting?

170
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,243
Betty Hutton stopped by
giving out blowjobs.

171
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,912
- What'd you get?
- (grunts)

172
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,289
Well, these...

173
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,709
are for me.

174
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,587
But if you're nice and mind your manners,
I might give you a puff.

175
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,256
These...

176
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,092
are for you miscreants.

177
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,344
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, yeah.

178
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,097
Traded the crackers
with F Company.

179
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,224
- Hey, peaches.
- Peaches?

180
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,309
I got the goddamn runs
and you had to get peaches.

181
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,270
They were all
out of cheese, Runner.

182
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,153
Chuckler:
Oh, my God, these are amazing.

183
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:27,907
Ah, where have you been all my life,
you beautiful can?

184
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,492
Ah.
(laughs)

185
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,834
(groans)

186
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,464
(grunting)

187
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,684
Peaches.
Your new name is Peaches.

188
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,896
- Fuck you.
- You got it, Peaches.

189
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,731
(both laughing)

190
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,735
- You gotta write Vera about this.
- (laughing)

191
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:08,364
(gagging, coughing)

192
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,707
Runner,

193
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,335
your new nickname
is Old Faithful.

194
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,961
Fuck you, Peaches.

195
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:27,508
(distant rumbling,
booming)

196
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,933
Bud...
bud, we gotta go.

197
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,185
Come on, bud!
Come on! We gotta go!

198
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,819
- Ahh!
- Shit.

199
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:54,786
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

200
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,372
Son of a bitch!

201
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,877
- (Hoosier yelling)
- (barks)

202
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,881
(dog whining)

203
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,716
Fuck!

204
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,888
You're okay.
We're gonna make it through.

205
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,224
- You're okay. You're okay.
- Shit.

206
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,645
Shit!

207
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,484
- I ain't going anywhere.
- God damn it!

208
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,861
Fuck you, fuck you!

209
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,031
Man:
Ahh!

210
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,453
(explosions booming)

211
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,753
(men coughing)

212
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,755
- Basilone: Sound off!
- LaPointe.

213
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,465
- Evans.
- Upton.

214
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,634
Garland.

215
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,848
- Come on, get up.
- (men shouting)

216
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,352
Help me out.

217
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,354
I got him.

218
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,691
(men coughing)

219
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,736
(Evans crying)

220
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,905
- Evans.
- (crying, whimpering)

221
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,369
- Start digging out.
- I can't, I can't.

222
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,039
- Miller.
- Garcia.

223
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,964
(men continuing
to sound off)

224
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,142
Man:
Let's go. Keep looking for bodies.

225
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,311
Man #2:
What about the Jeeps?

226
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,390
Rodriquez:
Direct hit.

227
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,645
Some little Jap lady,
weapons plant...

228
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,982
she puts in five more grams
of explosives.

229
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,151
Morgan:
Man, that could've been us.

230
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,073
Basilone, Manny, JP.

231
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,160
Briggs, what is it?

232
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,125
Basilone:
Briggs.

233
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,169
Chesty wants
Dog Company NCOs at his CP.

234
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,140
Puller:
Our battalion will join Hanneken's

235
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,892
in our old position
south of the airfield.

236
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,520
Now it's been
a quiet sector.

237
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,771
It's rough terrain.

238
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,524
Topside thinks
the Japs

239
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,526
are going to attack
up by the Matanikau,

240
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,403
hoping that they can
run their armor

241
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,780
up the coast road
right into the airfield.

242
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:22,743
If that happens,
they might pull Hanneken,

243
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:27,874
put him up north to reinforce the 5th
and the 1st Marines.

244
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,710
And that is gonna
leave us alone,

245
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,795
singled up on the line.

246
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:37,633
Now if the Japs
do break through

247
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,760
and they retake
the airfield,

248
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,096
our orders are
to take to the jungles

249
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,765
and fight as guerrillas.

250
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,935
This is not
going to happen.

251
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,520
Men:
Aye aye, sir.

252
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,025
Move your men
to the line at Sector 3.

253
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,818
- Get it done.
- Men: Aye aye, sir!

254
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,696
Basilone,
you and Rodriguez stay behind.

255
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,952
Listen, can you spare
this hombre?

256
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,246
I need another runner.

257
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,835
Hell, Colonel,
we're sick of him.

258
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,963
Get your shit.
Meet me back at the CP.

259
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,381
Aye aye, sir.

260
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,011
Good luck, man.

261
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,852
Hanneken's being pulled
up north to the Matanikau.

262
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,480
Japs will make
their push up there.

263
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,899
Where's Briggs
headed?

264
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,360
Rodriguez:
Setting up an outpost south of the line.

265
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,071
Fuck it.
We're on our own.

266
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,323
Let's go, Marines.
Move move move.

267
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,075
You'll be singled up.

268
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,285
Just like Chesty said.

269
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,872
Man: Okay, Marines, let's get
these supplies up the line.

270
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,635
- How did Chesty get all the phones?
- God knows.

271
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,262
He wants every gun-pit
on a party line

272
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,681
so we got a man
listening at all times.

273
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,975
(cranking phone)

274
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,609
Man:
Hey, you want some limit stakes

275
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,986
in there, Sergeant?

276
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:23,030
Yeah, go get it.

277
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,588
(gun clinking)

278
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,807
The Japs are on the move.

279
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,892
Hoosier and Runner,
I want you to set up an LP.

280
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,270
- 30 yards inside the tree line.
- Aye aye, Captain.

281
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,105
I want your MG
smack up on the wire,

282
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,149
but preset placements
so you can move back.

283
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,984
How thin are we
on the line, sir?

284
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,777
We're putting
the cooks on the line,

285
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,863
but don't have
enough cooks.

286
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,073
Best case, we hear the shit
going off on the other side of the ridge.

287
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,908
Why the other side
of the ridge?

288
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,910
The Japs decided to go around
us to hit the airfield.

289
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,371
We're too spread out,
same as Puller and the 7th.

290
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,291
Well, same old story
for the 1st Marines.

291
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,836
Two-hour watches tonight
all along the line.

292
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,756
What you guys smokin'?
Raleighs?

293
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,966
That's our allotment.

294
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,969
Only the officers
get the Lucky Strikes.

295
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,306
Well, I can't have
my platoon suffering.

296
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,394
Eyes open, ears up.

297
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,104
Aye aye, sir.

298
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,482
That was a gesture
of a gentleman.

299
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,443
- Hoosier: We must really be fucked.
- Runner: Yep.

300
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,033
(thunder rumbling,
crashing)

301
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,037
Thanks, Evans.

302
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,961
Here, Sergeant,
while it's still dry.

303
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,672
Thanks.

304
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,552
A buddy of mine's
up there with the 5th,

305
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,723
played the trumpet with me
in the Division band.

306
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,977
You any good
on the trumpet?

307
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:21,065
Nah, mostly because
I play the trombone.

308
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,782
That was a joke.

309
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,784
Look at you.

310
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,702
We'll make a Marine
out of you yet.

311
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,913
Man:
It's starting to come faster.

312
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,375
(thunder rumbling,
distant booming)

313
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:43,045
Sir, it's Briggs
at the outpost.

314
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,256
Puller.
Report, over.

315
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,217
(whispering)
I got the whole fucking Jap army

316
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,761
headed your way, over.

317
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,435
When they're past you,
pull out and hook up with Able Company.

318
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,896
1st Battalion,
hold your fire as long as possible.

319
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,691
Say again,
hold your fire.

320
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,860
Over.

321
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,197
We don't have enough men.

322
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,494
- Puller: Get Division on the line.
- Man: Aye aye, sir.

323
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:16,871
- Rodriguez.
- Sir.

324
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,539
Run as much ammo
down there as you can.

325
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,957
Aye aye, sir.

326
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,924
They're not just coming
across the Matanikau.

327
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,552
They're coming
right at us.

328
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,055
(gun clinking)

329
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,106
(flare gun fires)

330
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,834
Man:
Squad leaders, give me a head count!

331
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,171
- Man #2: First squad's up.
- Man #3: Second squad's up.

332
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,007
- Everyone okay?
- Yes, Sergeant.

333
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,137
Man:
Japs!

334
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,099
Japs left, crawling in!

335
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,935
(screaming)

336
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,901
On your right!

337
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,073
- Reload.
- Man: Changing the box.

338
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,701
Cover.

339
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,129
Reload.

340
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:02,601
- Man: Medic!
- Man #2: Reload.

341
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:17,199
- Man: Cease fire!
- Man #2: Cease fire!

342
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,827
(mortars whizzing)

343
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,912
Man:
Contact on the left.

344
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,414
Morgan:
No shit.

345
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,000
(laughs)
That's JP for you.

346
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,918
- How much ammo you got?
- Half a belt.

347
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,587
- That's it?
- Yeah.

348
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,505
This is our last box too,
Sergeant.

349
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,675
- (yelling)
- Fuck!

350
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,017
Fuck!

351
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,318
Reload!

352
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,528
(shouts in Japanese)

353
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,410
Fuck, my gun's jammed!

354
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,082
Basilone:
Evans, mend the gun.

355
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,962
(Japanese troops yelling)

356
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,214
Man:
Grenades out there!

357
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,928
You're up!

358
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,687
Sergeant!

359
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,815
Sergeant,
they broke through!

360
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,859
They overran us.
Both guns are out.

361
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,028
Man: Conserve your ammo.
We're running low.

362
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,696
Evans, we're going.

363
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,366
We gotta help JP.

364
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,910
Where the hell is my glove?

365
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:47,081
- LaPointe, the tripod.
- Aye aye, Sergeant.

366
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,669
- (sizzles)
- Ahh.

367
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,046
Cover cover!

368
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,048
Man:
To my right! To my right!

369
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,635
Get it on there.

370
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,221
Man:
Fill in that gap!

371
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,818
(grunts)

372
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:19,154
- (yells)
- (shouting in Japanese)

373
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,951
(shouting in Japanese)

374
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:28,747
(roaring, shouting
in Japanese)

375
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,012
(man shouts
in Japanese)

376
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:47,391
(both grunting)

377
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,352
(whimpering)

378
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,979
(choking)

379
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,568
(speaks Japanese)

380
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,864
(yelling)

381
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,408
(speaks Japanese)

382
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,500
Let's go!

383
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,134
(men screaming)

384
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,514
Man:
Ammo ammo!

385
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,934
Reload!

386
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,020
(machine-gun fire,
bullets whizzing)

387
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:42,112
(men shouting in Japanese)

388
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,324
- How many got through?
- At least 50.

389
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,785
- Ahh! Shit!
- You okay?

390
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,703
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Here they come!

391
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,998
(Japanese troops yelling)

392
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,583
Jesus Christ.

393
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,543
(shouting)

394
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,106
God damn!

395
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,298
(gunfire stops)

396
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,556
Man:
I need a head and ammo count.

397
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,976
Man #2:
First squad: Two down,

398
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,769
80 rounds remaining.

399
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:59,648
Man #3:
Third squad: Three casualties.

400
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:03,026
- JP, cover me.
- John, wait. What are you doing?

401
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,195
John, what are you doing?

402
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,616
(yelling in Japanese)

403
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,207
(grunting, panting)

404
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,295
John, move,
left flank.

405
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,422
John,
get outta there!

406
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,216
Grenade!

407
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,349
- What the hell was that?
- Now you've got a clear field of fire.

408
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,894
- A clear field...
- LaPointe, Evans,

409
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,021
stay here,
hold this position.

410
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,609
- I'm gonna get more ammo.
- Morgan: Hurry back.

411
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,994
Ammo for the 30s!

412
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,495
Come on, come on,
come on!

413
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,456
That's all we got.

414
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,673
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

415
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,774
Ugh!

416
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,943
(groaning)

417
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:56,098
- Ammo!
- Man: I need cover!

418
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:01,186
(Japanese troops yelling)

419
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,555
Just keep it still.

420
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:40,017
Man:
Damn this. Goddamn bugs.

421
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,340
Man:
Follow this barbed wire

422
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,176
and find out where
the bridge is.

423
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,847
(sighs)

424
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,392
Is he okay?

425
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,062
Yeah, he's okay.

426
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,230
He's sleeping.

427
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,235
- Manny all right?
- Haven't seen him.

428
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,033
Guess I need
a new one, huh?

429
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,744
You and me both.

430
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,633
- Has he had any morphine?
- No.

431
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,052
- (groaning)
- Thanks.

432
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,264
- Hold him down.
- (speaking Latin)

433
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,730
Hey, Sergeant,
hand me that pail.

434
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,900
(continues in Latin)

435
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,655
Those are
third-degree burns.

436
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,199
Have a seat over there
and we'll get to you when we can.

437
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,077
(gasping)

438
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,582
Sir, anybody bring in
Sergeant Rodriguez last night?

439
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:31,086
- Manny Rodriguez?
- I wish I could keep track.

440
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,226
(wincing)

441
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,068
Check the aid station?

442
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:07,622
Man: Doesn't take long
to get ripe in this heat.

443
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,207
Man #2:
They're real damn stupid

444
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,126
to keep running into
a machine gun like that.

445
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:14,546
- Man #3: Morning, sir.
- Puller: As you were.

446
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,137
Nice work.

447
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,516
(sighs)

448
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,978
I'm putting you in
for a medal, John.

449
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,940
We're gonna be moving
west toward Lunga, up on the ridge.

450
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,067
164th's gonna take
this position.

451
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,114
- Get yourselves some hot chow.
- Aye aye, sir.

452
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,868
Captain.

453
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,208
(bugle playing)

454
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:08,099
(birds twittering)

455
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,902
(breathing deeply)

456
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,961
It's gone, isn't it?

457
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,764
Doesn't matter.

458
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:14,893
I'm enlisting tomorrow.

459
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,561
I'd do it tonight
if they were open.

460
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,731
- Eugene...
- I don't need your permission, Father.

461
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,861
I haven't for some time.

462
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:43,046
The worst thing about treating those
combat boys from the Great War

463
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:47,217
wasn't that they had
had their flesh torn.

464
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:52,680
It was that they had
had their souls torn out.

465
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,894
I don't want to look
in your eyes someday

466
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:02,857
and see no spark,
no love, no... no life.

467
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,820
That would break my heart.

468
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,212
Give me some time
to break the news to your mother.

469
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:29,050
After supper
I'll take Deacon for a walk.

470
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,219
That would do it.

471
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,063
Thank you, Father.

472
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,278
Come on, Deacon.

473
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,500
Leckie's voice:
"The foe you gave was strong and brave

474
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:06,087
And unafraid to die.

475
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,840
Speak to the Lord
for our comrades,

476
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,051
Killed when the battle
seemed lost.

477
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,971
They went to meet
a bright defeat...

478
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,682
The hero's holocaust.

479
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,436
False is the vaunt
of the victor,

480
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,647
Empty our living pride.

481
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,650
For those who fell
there is no hell...

482
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,861
Not for the brave
who died."

483
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,113
Say hi for me.

484
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,115
- What?
- Vera.

485
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,992
Tell her Runner
says Howdy do.

486
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,833
It's not a letter,
it's a poem,

487
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,294
- an ode.
- Hmm.

488
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,047
An epitaph
in celebration of our...

489
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,424
glorious victory
at Guadalcanal.

490
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,968
Must be tough
to write that poem.

491
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,221
I mean what the hell rhymes
with "Guadalcanal"?

492
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,558
How fucked are we now
on Guadalcanal?

493
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:04,229
Corrigan:
Get your gear and stand by to stand by.

494
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,650
We're finally leaving
this shithole.

495
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,708
Man:
Clear the raft.

496
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,963
Man #2: Squad leaders, make sure
all your Marines

497
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:33,049
have all their gear
and all their equipment.

498
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,051
Jesus fucking Christ,
out with it.

499
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,304
Man:
First squad, pick up your gear.

500
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,099
As fast
as a bullet goes...

501
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,894
It's just a split second.

502
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:52,193
Manny steps to the left
instead of his right...

503
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,779
- He slows down...
- Yeah, but he didn't.

504
00:42:56,282 --> 00:43:00,201
I mean he was
where he was and, you know...

505
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,663
he did what he did.

506
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,505
You don't ever
think about that?

507
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,259
You know me, John.

508
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,386
I try not to think.

509
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,476
If it happens,
it happens.

510
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,987
We should get moving.

511
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,366
Yeah.

512
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,698
No chow till 1400.
I'm sorry.

513
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,911
Hey, we heard
there was coffee.

514
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,246
Coffee?

515
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:29,916
Shit, I can get you guys
some coffee.

516
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,459
Milk and sugar?

517
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,230
Cook:
So how bad was it?

518
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,776
'Cause I heard
it was bad.

519
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,795
- From who?
- What do you mean?

520
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,171
I mean before
you got here,

521
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,340
had you ever even
heard of this place?

522
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,218
Guadalcanal?

523
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,929
Everybody's heard
of Guadalcanal

524
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,514
