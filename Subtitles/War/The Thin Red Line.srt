722
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:56,858

of this position for a thousand yards.

That's a hell of a mistake.

<i>Only one thing a man can do -</i>

1351
02:38:55,569 --> 02:38:57,904
<i>find something that's his...</i>

1352
02:39:00,782 --> 02:39:03,243
<i>make an island for himself.</i>

1353
02:39:16,423 --> 02:39:20,302
<i>If I never meet you in this life...</i>

1354
02:39:20,385 --> 02:39:22,596
<i>let me feel the lack.</i>

1355
02:39:30,979 --> 02:39:33,190
<i>A glance from your eyes...</i>

1356
02:39:33,273 --> 02:39:35,525
<i>and my life will be yours.</i>

1357
02:40:24,574 --> 02:40:28,495
<i>[Train] Somethin' I can come back to.
Some kind of foundation.</i>

1358
02:40:28,578 --> 02:40:33,250
<i>I mean, I don't know what, you know -
what your plans are, but...</i>

1359
02:40:33,333 --> 02:40:34,751
I'm determined now.

1360
02:40:34,835 --> 02:40:37,754
I've been through
the thick and thin of it.

1361
02:40:37,838 --> 02:40:41,424
You know, I may be young,
but I've lived plenty of life.

1362
02:40:41,508 --> 02:40:43,927
I'm ready to start living it good.

1363
02:40:44,010 --> 02:40:45,838
You know, my daddy always told me

1364
02:40:45,863 --> 02:40:48,873
it's gonna get a whole lot worse
before it gets better.

1365
02:40:48,932 --> 02:40:53,353
You know, 'cause life ain't supposed
to be that hard when you're young.

1366
02:40:53,436 --> 02:40:57,858
Well, I - I figure after this,
the worst is gonna be gone though.

1367
02:40:57,941 --> 02:41:01,403
It's time for things to get better.
That's what I want.

1368
02:41:02,487 --> 02:41:04,573
That's what's gonna happen.

1369
02:41:05,699 --> 02:41:08,451
I'm getting older now.

1370
02:41:08,535 --> 02:41:11,788
<i>By no means old, but older.</i>

1371
02:41:11,872 --> 02:41:14,875
<i>[Train ]
Where is it that we were together?</i>

1372
02:41:18,170 --> 02:41:21,214
<i>Who were you that I lived with...</i>

1373
02:41:25,218 --> 02:41:27,345
<i>walked with?</i>

1374
02:41:34,394 --> 02:41:36,396
<i>The brother.</i>

1375
02:41:42,944 --> 02:41:44,946
<i>The friend.</i>

1376
02:42:11,556 --> 02:42:13,892
<i>[Train]
Darkness and light.</i>

1377
02:42:15,018 --> 02:42:18,146
<i>Strife and love.</i>

1378
02:42:18,230 --> 02:42:22,651
<i>Are they the workings of one mind...</i>

1379
02:42:22,734 --> 02:42:25,737
<i>the features of the same face?</i>

1380
02:42:40,335 --> 02:42:42,379
<i>[Train]
O my soul...</i>

1381
02:42:44,130 --> 02:42:46,633
<i>let me be in you now.</i>

1382
02:42:52,180 --> 02:42:54,849
<i>Look out through my eyes.</i>

1383
02:42:55,892 --> 02:42:58,895
<i>Look out at the things you made.</i>

1384
02:43:03,233 --> 02:43:05,902
<i>All things shining.</i>
