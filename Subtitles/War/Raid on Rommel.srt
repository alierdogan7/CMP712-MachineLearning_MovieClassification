1
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,436
Captain, I've come from Tobruk.
I've a message from General Lederer.

2
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,910
And these cigars with compliments.

3
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,598
Major, I have orders.
Your men are to leave for Tobruk.

4
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,754
Tobruk? Why, that's crazy!
- Those are my orders.

5
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,472
That's an active war zone! Prisoners
of war are to be sent to a safe area.

6
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,758
Tobruk is now ours.
I assure you it is safe.

7
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,435
The Geneva Convention
has explicit rules...

8
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,913
We also have those rules. Your side
was notified about this movement.

9
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,753
Heil Hitler!

10
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,789
You will do that too. So prepare!

11
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,915
We leave immediately.
- And what if we refuse to go?

12
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,673
We will leave you here.

13
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,834
Then you will see there are
worse things than dysentery.

14
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,912
Merrihew!
- Sir?

15
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,676
Pack it.
- Yes, sir.

16
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,069
Captain, the girl. She is crazy.
She is speaking of an airplane.

17
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,755
I will see to her.

18
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,351
Italian whores don't impress me!

19
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,398
Speak English, you Kraut!

20
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,759
What is the problem, Signorina?
- Why am I not leaving to Tobruk?

21
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:16,280
Special air transport calls for
special authority. - I got!

22
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,789
Courtesy shown the bearer
will greatly oblige General Banducci.

23
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,510
Yes, I know of your position
with the General. - Position?

24
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,480
You are very attached to his staff.

25
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,590
He's molto grande, il Generale!
You only piccolo Captain.

26
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,278
Italians are stylish warriors. I wish
they'd keep their women on a leash.

27
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,389
Any other jokes?

28
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,998
Yes.
You will travel like the rest of us.

29
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,474
How is that?
- In a truck. Continue packing.

30
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,118
Amsterdam. The Hollanders.
They make good cigars, no?

31
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,878
Very nice. - Cured dry as the Sahara.
Rommel himself smokes these.

32
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,432
You know Rommel? - Yes.
He loves the Sahara. We all do.

33
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,877
By "we",
I mean the professional military.

34
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,953
I'm not a military man, Captain.
War holds no romance for me.

35
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,592
The side effects are repulsive.
- Here there are no side effects.

36
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,675
No women, no children,
no towns to get in the way.

37
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,640
Just men, my Doctor.

38
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,200
Just men?
- Yes...

39
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,229
Halt!

40
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,073
Get out of the vehicle!
Give orders to leave the vehicles!

41
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,629
Yes, sir!

42
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,679
Follow the vehicle cautiously.

43
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,710
He's alive, Captain.

44
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,634
Dead or alive?
- Dead. They stink already.

45
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,874
Search the dead and the cabin.
Bring me all the papers!

46
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,750
The man is suffering from exposure
and dehydration. He needs treatment.

47
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,789
Give it to him.
We camp here for tonight.

48
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,670
Use the trucks to make a camp.
Pitch the tents.

49
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,672
We will stay till 4 a. m.

50
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,311
Corporal, your pulse
and respiration are quite normal.

51
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,756
You're shamming. Why?

52
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,517
I'm Foster.
Your ID tag reads Weatherly, J.D.

53
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,038
That's my cover. I'm Foster.
Captain, 53rd Combat Engineers.

54
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,558
You don't know?
- What? - 8th Army Intelligence.

55
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:38,115
I've never had contact with
Intelligence, 8th Army or otherwise.

56
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,594
You are Major Farrow, aren't you?
- I'm Tarkington, Hugh. Medical Corps.

57
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,355
Where the hell is Farrow?
- Who?

58
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,912
Those prisoners in the convoy
are the 5th Commandos, aren't they?

59
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,949
No, that's my outfit,
the 15th field hospital unit.

60
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,271
God damn it to Hell!

61
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,235
The moment he is conscious
bring him to me for questioning.

62
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,111
It may be a little while, Captain.
I'm afraid he's in shock. - Yes...

63
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,951
We continue now with a report
from CBS London and Edward R. Murrow.

64
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,998
This is London.

65
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,188
The loss of Tobruk will make
supplying Malta even more difficult.

66
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,592
And the battle for Egypt
may even now be underway.

67
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,878
At the moment, all that can be said

68
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,636
is that Parliament and the press
are looking for someone to blame.

69
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,395
There's no question
about the conduct of British troops.

70
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,475
Their bravery deserved victory
but they were defeated.

71
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,714
But Rommel is fond of the unorthodox
and speculation is futile.

72
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,157
Rommel is being
reinforced through Tobruk.

73
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,151
Tell me! Are you
a member of the 5th Commandos?

74
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,312
Get him out of here.

75
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,109
Quite a performance.

76
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,714
What in the name of God is that?

77
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,998
Don't worry, she's real.
Belongs to an Italian general.

78
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,349
Any more? - No, she's the only one.
Signorina Vivian something or other.

79
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,271
English pigs!

80
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,956
She's the only passenger...
- What happened to the 5th Commandos?

81
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,351
That's an interesting question.

82
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,911
To ask it makes this the bloody
muck-up of all time. - Who are you?

83
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,713
Sergeant MacKenzie, 5th Commandos.
- 5th Commandos? Any others here?

84
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,756
Well, we're it.
Ed Brown, Bill Wembley,

85
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,390
Dan Garth and Reilly.

86
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,917
We were left behind when
our unit was moved. Acute dysentery.

87
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,871
Except me. I got a bad tattoo
from Alexandria. - And the others?

88
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,912
Shipped to a prison camp in Tunisia.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

89
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,199
I don't see why that's a surprise.
- Did he brief you? Major Farrow?

90
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,673
Only what he had to. He told us
we were going to Tobruk as prisoners.

91
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,470
On the way, we'd scuttle
the German guard and take over.

92
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,556
Your credentials say you're an expert
on the harbor guns at Tobruk.

93
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,228
If it's any comfort, we had 50 men
trained to blow them to Hell.

94
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,631
You said
he only told you what he had to.

95
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,508
Any idiot private
could spell it out, sir.

96
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,639
Rommel is building up supplies
in Tobruk for his next attack.

97
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,510
He controls the air. The only way
to clobber Tobruk is from the sea.

98
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,994
To clear the way for Navy
those guns have to be knocked out.

99
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,591
That's it, isn't it?
- That's it.

100
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,549
I don't think it concerns us.
- It does. How many men do you have?

101
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,554
Whatever nonsense you have in mind
you're not involving my men.

102
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:55,159
At 1700 hours tomorrow, one of
our planes will attack the convoy.

103
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,189
The purpose was to create confusion
so the 5th Commandos could take over.

104
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,878
A deliberate air attack?
- Nevertheless, the pilot will strike.

105
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,713
To scrub this mission

106
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,113
I need a radio. The only way I can
do that is by taking over the convoy.

107
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,550
And then?

108
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,954
Then we drive back to British lines.
A long way through enemy territory.

109
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,148
But with wheels and guns
and fuel and a little luck...

110
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,791
Who knows? One further question:
Where is the medical kit kept?

111
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,475
I know the truck it's on.
But why, sir?

112
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,073
We need weapons
in order to acquire better weapons.

113
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,191
I'll see to it, sir.
- Good, good.

114
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,071
I accept that you are dedicated,
Captain. You will do what you must.

115
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,349
But without me or any of my men
that don't want to be involved.

116
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,391
Sir, I'm a Quaker. I'm in the Medical
Corps as a conscientious objector.

117
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,112
I cannot help you in a mission
where I would have to kill someone.

118
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,154
Sergeant...

119
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,754
The next morning, the Hitler Youth
marched at the Berlin Stadium.

120
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,678
In spite of rain and fog,
132,000 came to greet their Fuehrer.

121
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,269
Everything you are,
you are through me.

122
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,434
And everything that I am,
I am through you.

123
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,274
And because the German nation's

124
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,719
master race
in its pride and confidence,

125
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,035
bravely and daringly
demands leadership,

126
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,278
the people

127
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,719
in ever-growing numbers
pledge allegiance to our leadership.

128
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,239
Sieg Heil!

129
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,991
Isn't that a Luger?
- No, it's a Walther. Automatic.

130
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,759
Beautiful.
Really something, eh lads?

131
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,911
What are you doing in the box?

132
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,271
What are you doing back there?

133
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,956
My arm hurts bad.
Very badly. I need medicine.

134
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,590
OK, take the medicine.

135
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,509
ETHER

136
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,157
The people of Germany
rejoice in the knowledge

137
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,074
that the eternal need to flee

138
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:17,476
has been replaced by
an eternal sense of belonging!

139
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,589
Any of you chaps got the right time?
I make it nearly 5 o'clock.

140
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,709
1700 hours?

141
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,671
How about a tea break, for instance?
- Or a beer break? - Is that a Rolex?

142
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,356
Yes. English. Rolex.
- Rolex?

143
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,230
Rolex is not English.
It's a Swiss watch. - Yes.

144
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,478
How much? - Maybe I'll make a deal
with you if you play your cards right.

145
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,873
It's a Swiss watch. - That's right.
- How much do you want for it?

146
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,349
How much?

147
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,639
1700 hours.

148
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,629
Spread out!

149
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,592
Stay there!

150
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,757
Foster, you goddamn boy scout!

151
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,751
My God, help!

152
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,272
Too bad about the radio, sir. - Yes.

153
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,196
Make up a burial detail
and post a guard over the prisoners.

154
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,875
Do you know of the Geneva Convention
concerning treatment of prisoners?

155
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,431
There's more to the Africa Corps
than uniform, much more.

156
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,070
You all will be shot as spies!

157
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,914
I wish I could shoot you myself!

158
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,359
You won't be buried, Superman.
We'll leave you for the vultures.

159
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,749
The burned-out truck is hopeless.
The others are ready to roll.

160
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,233
Feed the men.
- The Germans too, sir? - Yes.

161
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,191
I haven't found any papers, sir.
- I've got them. - Are they in order?

162
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:24,470
Official passage for British prisoners
with Africa Corps escort to Tobruk.

163
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,717
MacKenzie...
- Sir?

164
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,913
We're a long way from our lines.
Let's get going. Now.

165
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,074
There's been a change of plan.
- Change of plan?

166
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,793
The radio has been blown to bits
so we stick to our original operation.

167
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,352
The next step is an airdrop
of weapons and explosive devices.

168
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,357
Do you propose to raid Tobruk with
a hospital unit and 4 sick commandos?

169
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,479
No, I'm going to blow up their guns.

170
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,713
The device involved
could be carried in your medical kit.

171
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,999
But the delivery requires men.
The truth is it's a suicide mission!

172
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,638
No. The Navy picks us up.
I've no more desire to die than you.

173
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,552
What about them?

174
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,597
They remain here.
- Alive.

175
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,037
Here comes our supply drop!

176
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,073
Look sharp, lads! On the double!

177
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,871
Cut those supplies loose
and bury the chutes. Hurry it up!

178
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,832
Here's some more, fellows!
Get moving! Get over here!

179
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,556
Get a move on now,
we haven't got all blooming night!

180
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,349
Get them in, cowboys!

181
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,592
I give you my word, alright?

182
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,954
What about the girl?
- She stays with us.

183
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,478
She's an integral part of the convoy.
On the official bill of lading.

184
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,872
She's yours, Doctor. All yours.
- Mine?

185
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:32,957
I don't care if you cut out her
tongue. She's your responsibility.

186
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:38,715
But the prisoners live.
- Alright. Deal.

187
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,710
Right lads. Over the side.

188
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,919
You grip the rope with the right hand
and pay it out with the left.

189
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,788
Hold it tight but let it out slowly.

190
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,988
Easy does it. Pay attention,
your life depends on it.

191
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,030
You're not rolling pills now.
We'll teach you how to be Commandos.

192
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,158
Careful.

193
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,791
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine...

194
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:01,160
Listen carefully. This weapon can
hurt you as much as the enemy.

195
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,836
This cylinder contains Napalm,
the other contains compressed air.

196
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,835
You release it by pulling this valve.
The air comes up here.

197
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,949
You pull the trigger. And here
is a thing called an "increment. "

198
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,796
This thing spins around and
operates like a cigarette lighter.

199
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,589
Don't get forward!
Never get in front of the machine!

200
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,358
Hold it up away from you. Put your
finger on the trigger. And press!

201
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,394
I'd hate to lead them into
a real brannigan at this point.

202
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,475
But they're better than I expected
and, well, we'll play it by ear.

203
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,710
Silence. Quiet.

204
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,999
Quiet. Silence. You know silence?
- Silence.

205
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,475
What about that girl?
- She's going to be difficult.

206
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,633
She's unpredictable, sir.
- He's right.

207
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,237
We'll run into Nazis in 100 miles. If
she blows the whistle, we've had it.

208
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,551
There must be something we can do.

209
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,192
Pity you're not helpful. - Pardon?
- Eating out of your hand in no time.

210
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,831
Doc, you're supposed to know
about women. - Not this kind.

211
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,550
I can picture your patients
in Harley Street very clearly.

212
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,910
An emotional appeal doesn't work. I
dare say she has a price. - No doubt.

213
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,154
I gave in on the prisoners.
I hope we don't have to pay for that.

214
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,074
As far as the girl goes...
- Let me try again.

215
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,790
There's very little time.
- There's no time, Captain.

216
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,555
For God's sake... Hold it!

217
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,431
Alright, get out!

218
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,877
Two full Panzer divisions.
What the devil are they doing here?

219
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,316
Never mind. My men are ready.
Let's attack!

220
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,713
Fork to the left, the sea and Derna.
Our Tobruk road lies straight ahead.

221
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,039
Suspicious, our standing here, sir.
- Yeah.

222
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,638
Your other German-speaking man?
- Garth. - He rides in the rear.

223
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,349
You come along with me.

224
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,675
Shall I take care of her, sir?
- No, she's in the clearance papers.

225
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,551
You said she's my responsibility.
Well, I've got something.

226
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,317
Too late for that. - I'm a doctor.
She'll be taken care of.

227
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,076
What's the problem?

228
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,314
The Italian lady. Where is she?
- She's there.

229
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,073
Corporal!

230
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,509
She belongs to one of
Mussolini's generals. Understand?

231
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,193
Yes...

232
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,878
We'll take the road to the sea.
- No, that area is off-limits.

233
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,593
You'll continue on to Tobruk.
- We'll camp here. - That's allowed.

234
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,199
Park there.

235
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,033
Park there!

236
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,399
When I suggested we attack the Jerrys
I was venturing a little joke.

237
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,314
Two Panzer divisions...
I don't understand that.

238
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,029
Maybe Rommel's waiting for the right
time. - Rommel waits for nothing.

239
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:34,118
They might have come from Derna.
No, that's the 11th and 21st Division.

240
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,911
Reps camp! Parts. Repair shop.
- They could do that in the field.

241
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,355
Fuel!

242
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,793
Rommel must have a fuel dump nearby.

243
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,672
Heavily camouflaged.
- Underground? - Where?

244
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:56,110
A Panzer division without fuel is
scrap. If we could immobilize two...

245
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,513
But it's all... You've got no radio.
No way of communicating...

246
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,230
Communicating?
How you do go on, Doctor.

247
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,074
If I locate the bastards
I'll blow them sky high.

248
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,472
Maximum security installation.
How do we get in?

249
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,590
If you get past the road block
you can ask Rommel.
