1
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:25,724
It's definitely
the hotspur, sir.

2
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,495
Yes, matthews.

3
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:32,731
Styles, put a ball
close to her stern,
but not too close.

4
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,634
Aye, aye, sir.
Close but not
too close it is.

5
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,503
But it's--
It's the hotspur, sir.

6
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,639
Aah!

7
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,074
Styles,
for god's sake, man.

8
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,175
Sorry, sir.

9
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,679
Look, sir.
Now she shows
her true colors.

10
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:47,846
I thought something
was wrong.

11
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,182
Well, if the frogs have
taken the hotspur, sir,

12
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,817
It's only proper
we should take it back.

13
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,152
Indeed, matthews.

14
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,653
Lay us alongside.
Aye, aye,
sir.

15
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,361
Matthews: gunners, stand by!
Contact at the next head!

16
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,837
Matthews:
come here!
Look at that!

17
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,638
That's their idea
of the cavalry?

18
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,741
Pity the poor bastards.

19
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,945
Why has he
got the flag down?

20
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:04,957
Where is your captain?

21
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:08,327
I don't know, sir.
It's to me.

22
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,461
Oh, yes.

23
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:10,462
And do you surrender?

24
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,370
Well done, sir,

25
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,239
And, uh, i just thought
you ought to know, sir.

26
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,740
There's a cutter
headed this way.

27
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,176
And do you suppose
this cutter to be
a threat, matthews?

28
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,277
No, sir.

29
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,612
I don't quite know
what it is, sir.

30
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,681
I just thought
you ought to know, sir.

31
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,684
Look at this, sir.

32
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,319
He served
the victory, sir.

33
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:35,354
Are you british?

34
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,422
Irish, sir.

35
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,856
And proud
to be, sir.

36
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,725
English rule
is ireland's curse,

37
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,727
And if the french
offer us a hand,
we'll take it.

38
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,063
The irish rebellion
was crushed years ago, man.

39
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,397
It's not
finished yet.

40
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,865
Man: ahoy!
Peace, lads!

41
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,368
Different man:
it's peace with france!

42
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,303
It's peace!
It's peace, lads!
Lads, it's peace!

43
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,871
Ahoy, the ship!
Can you hear us?

44
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,474
It's peace!
Peace with france!

45
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,209
It's peace?
It's peace!

46
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,917
Leave him, matthews.

47
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:08,520
Killing one more poor devil
won't change the world.

48
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,555
The war is over, man.

49
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:13,058
Yeah. Yeah!

50
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,660
The war is over!

51
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,333
The war is over.

52
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,912
Man: lay on your oars!
Homeward a larboard!

53
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,592
Man: all right.
Mind your back.
Coming through.

54
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,033
Man:
all right, missis.

55
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,235
What can i do
for you today?

56
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,237
Different man:
mr. Hornblower,

57
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,339
You're here to redeem
your gray coat, no doubt.

58
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,674
The weather
is most inclement.

59
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,042
Alas, no.

60
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,210
Ah.

61
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,283
I can offer you
15 shillings.

62
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,685
15?

63
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,421
Alas, mr. Hornblower,
with the peace,

64
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,790
There's little demand
for naval swords.

65
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,243
Watch where
you're headed, man.

66
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,712
Beg your pardon, sir.
Sir?

67
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,615
Sir.
Mr. Bush?

68
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:44,616
It's good to see you.

69
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:45,918
It's good
to see you, sir.

70
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,953
You needn't call me sir.
Look. No epaulet.

71
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,254
But you're a commander.

72
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,522
You're captain
of the retribution.

73
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,758
I was a commander.
Now that we're at peace,

74
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,093
I'm once again
a mere lieutenant.

75
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,194
Infernal luck.

76
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,762
And what's more,
lieutenant without a ship.

77
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,498
Me, too.
Well, it's cold.
Where's your coat?

78
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,700
Why don't we go
to my lodgings?

79
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,969
We can talk there.

80
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:07,606
I come every month,
collect my half pay,

81
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,842
Stay wherever
it's convenient.

82
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,111
Cheap,
in other words.

83
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,445
Well, why not
lodge with me?

84
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,848
It's cheap here,
i assure you.

85
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,193
Oh, it's you.

86
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,762
Lieutenant bush,
mrs. Mason,

87
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,796
The lady
of the house.

88
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,431
Mr. Bush will be
my guest tonight.

89
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,701
You're very free
with your hospitality,
mr. Hornblower,

90
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,137
For someone whose rent
is so far in arrears.

91
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:41,440
I don't mind paying
in advance, madam.

92
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,175
It'll be a shilling
for the bed.

93
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,277
I can't wash the sheets
for less than that,

94
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,746
Not with soap,
as it is.

95
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:55,587
And that just leaves
mr. Hornblower's 15
that he owes us.

96
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,489
Oh, uh, sorry, mother.
I forgot.

97
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,592
Mr. Hornblower gave me
half a crown this morning.
It's up in my room.

98
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:05,064
If you spent
less time
daydreaming...

99
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,498
You're just like
your father--
Head in the clouds--

100
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:10,269
And look where
that got him.

101
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,671
I want that balance
by the end of the week.

102
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,108
This way.

103
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:17,576
I'll be up
presently.

104
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,552
She doesn't mean
to be so hard on you.

105
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:27,953
I think she does,
maria,

106
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,588
And with
good reason.

107
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,758
I'm not a good lodger,
not by any means.

108
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,860
Oh, please don't, sir.
I know you're good for it.

109
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,195
But your mother
will expect to see

110
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,496
This mythical
half crown.

111
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,231
I can handle my mother.

112
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,668
I have something put by
for my teaching,

113
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,938
And you have more need
of the money than me.

114
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,775
You truly are
a good friend, maria.

115
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,643
I thought i had none
left in the world.

116
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,545
I hope i'm more
than that, sir.

117
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,617
Maria, don't pin
your hopes on me.

118
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,719
I'm but a penniless
sailor with few
connections

119
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,655
And fewer prospects.

120
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:07,292
I know you are
a true gentleman,

121
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,561
And a gentleman...

122
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,098
Needs his sword.

123
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:19,571
Well, thank you.

124
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,175
Please, sir.

125
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,913
You have an admirer--

126
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,615
Your landlady's
daughter.

127
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:30,883
I saw the way
she looked at you.

128
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,152
Maria? No.

129
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,287
No, no, no.
Nonsense.

130
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:36,255
How could you
possibly afford

131
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,490
To come here
on half pay?

132
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,759
Follow me,
and i'll show you.

133
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,195
Man: ah,
mr. Hornblower.

134
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:46,765
Are you well, sir?

135
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,934
Admiral pellew, sir.
Yes. Very well,
thank you.

136
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,836
You remember
lieutenant
william bush.

137
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,604
We served together
in the renown.

138
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,606
To great effect,
as i recall.
Thank you, sir.

139
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:55,808
You joining
us for cards,
mr. Bush?

140
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,010
Mr. Bush is purely
a spectator
this evening,

141
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,411
But i shall be
honored, as always.

142
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,214
Then allow me
to introduce

143
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:03,749
An old acquaintance
to the table.

144
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,219
I think you'll find
this a very stimulating
contest.

145
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,657
You earn
your living here?

146
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:15,094
Well, my winnings
usually outweigh
my losses.

147
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,935
Ah, hornblower.

148
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,803
Good evening,
captain hammond.

149
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:29,174
A humble sloop
takes on two ships
of the line. Hmm.

150
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,810
Now, we shall soon see
if that is valor

151
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,579
Or mere foolhardiness.

152
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,714
Gentleman,
my nephew jack hammond.

153
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,416
Well, step up, lad.
Step up.

154
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:38,717
Good evening, gentlemen.

155
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:42,121
On his first visit
to the fleshpots
of portsmouth,

156
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,722
Hoping to be posted
to a ship.

157
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,857
You're in good company.

158
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,526
Some of the navy's
finest captains come here.

159
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,762
Pellew:
so, mr. Hammond,
given the choice,

160
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,764
With whom
would you serve?

161
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,699
Though, naturally,
i can make
no promises.

162
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,101
Well, come along.
Come along.

163
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,503
You study
the naval gazette.

164
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,004
Well, there is
one man, sir,

165
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,073
But he's not a captain.

166
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,375
I've read much
of your exploits, sir.

167
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,777
What? Horn--

168
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,612
Well, i'm sorry.

169
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,081
I'm in no position
to offer you
anything.

170
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,283
Indeed. You should think
more carefully, sir,

171
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,885
Before you nail
your colors to the mast.

172
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,421
Well, if he wishes
to go into battle
with mr. Hornblower,

173
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,789
There's always
the card table,

174
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,090
But i warn you,
mr. Hammond.

175
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:21,694
The lieutenant
is an exceptionally
gifted player.

176
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,730
My trick again,
by god.

177
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,099
One more trick,
and the game is ours.

178
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,634
Well, you and your nephew

179
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,569
Have all the luck
of the devil,
captain hammond.

180
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,539
Mr. Hornblower,
why are you
a lieutenant again

181
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:34,840
And no longer
a commander?

182
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,309
Because my promotion
was disallowed

183
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,812
When the retribution
was laid up.

184
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,815
The country
can't afford to keep
a wartime navy.

185
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,918
Otherwise, we'd be paying
this damned income tax
every year.

186
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,420
Let's hope
england's haste
to decommission

187
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:50,389
Does not prove
to be premature.

188
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:51,357
What do you think,
mr. Bush,

189
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,791
Or do you decline
from speculating

190
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,326
As well as gambling?

191
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,794
I'm equally poor
at both, sir,

192
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:57,296
But if i were
a gambling man,

193
00:09:57,364 --> 00:10:00,499
I'd wager
that this peace
won't last long.

194
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:01,667
Whatever bony's planning,

195
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:02,701
We'll be ready for him,
won't we, uncle?

196
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,969
This is hardly
the place to gossip

197
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,004
About military
matters, boy.

198
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,372
It's an officers club.

199
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,807
Even in such
illustrious
company, sir,

200
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,043
The best part of valor
is discretion.

201
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,712
And for all we know,
mr. Hornblower here

202
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,813
Might be sharing
his berth

203
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,081
With some republican
strumpet.

204
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,017
Oh.

205
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,285
Indeed,
i'm not, sir.

206
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,988
Oh, no,
not mr. Hornblower.

207
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:26,458
Unlucky with women.
Unlucky at cards.

208
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,863
Trick and rubber,
i think.

209
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,498
I think not, sir.

210
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,273
So. So we're down
to the last trick, then.

211
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,909
Which, i believe,
is mine, also.

212
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,180
You hold but a 7,
do you not?

213
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:56,622
I did warn you.

214
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,691
His talent
is quite formidable.

215
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,759
Well, gentlemen,
this evening

216
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,695
Has been quite
an education.

217
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:06,899
Hmm. A damned expensive
education at that.

218
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,668
Thank you, lieutenant.
I hope you and i--

219
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,036
Hammond: come, jack.

220
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,005
Sir edward.
Mm-Hmm.

221
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:15,808
Gentlemen.

222
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:18,610
Here's your winnings.

223
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,779
Use them wisely.

224
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:21,914
I'll see you
aboard the flagship

225
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:24,717
Two bells tomorrow
forenoon. Mr. Bush.

226
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,052
What do you think
he wants?

227
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,189
Well, i doubt he wants
to play whist.

228
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,891
No, but you--

229
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,227
You risked everything
on one hand.

230
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,663
My chances had
to right themselves
mathematically.

231
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:41,100
Don't you see?
Of course.

232
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,035
No. No, i don't.
Ha ha!

233
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,770
Aha.

234
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,238
Good evening,
mrs. Mason.

235
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,007
Oh, it might be
for young rakes

236
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,508
Squandering
their rent money

237
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,377
On dissipation
and drink.

238
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,778
By the scent
of gin, madam,

239
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,113
It's plain you've had
a head start.

240
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,748
Such insolence...

241
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,017
And those that
can't even pay
their reckoning.

242
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,285
If mr. Mason were here,
he'd throw you out!

243
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:01,387
Please, mother.
Don't.

244
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,188
You can shut your mouth.

245
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:06,492
It's because of you i've let
this young spark run on.

246
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,194
There's hardly a shirt
in his chest,

247
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,630
And his chest will be
at the pawnshop, too.

248
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,600
Hornblower:
mrs. Mason.

249
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:16,168
25 shillings.

250
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,170
What i owe you
plus a week's
notice.

251
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,605
A week's?
Mother.

252
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,240
Please,
mr. Hornblower,
you can't leave.

253
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,209
Oh, now, sir,
you wouldn't leave us

254
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,878
On account
of a misunderstanding.

255
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,813
No. We understood you
very well, madam.
Come on, horatio.

256
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,581
Mr. Hornblower,
don't go,

257
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:30,649
Not on such terms.

258
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:34,053
Well, i suppose
it is rather late

259
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,387
To go seeking
new lodgings.

260
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,555
William?

261
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,896
Come, mother,
you should be in bed.

262
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:47,099
I don't need
your ministrations,

263
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,901
Thank you, miss.

264
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:52,971
You wouldn't
really have left us,
would you, sir?

265
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,375
No, maria. I don't
believe i would.

266
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:58,844
Good night, sir.

267
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,012
Good night.

268
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,819
Pellew: ah, hornblower.

269
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:07,853
Admiral pellew, sir.

270
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,555
How's your head, man?
Hmm?

271
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,757
You spend the night
celebrating your
good fortune?

272
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,459
Alas, no, sir.

273
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,060
I had some debts
to settle.

274
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:18,230
Do you recognize
that 20-Gun sloop?

275
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:20,332
Hotspur, sir?

276
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,834
Hmm. Needs a captain.

277
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,702
A man of intelligence
and ability.

278
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,939
I was wondering
if you could suggest
anyone suitable.

279
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,407
Well, i, uh...

280
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,142
As you were.

281
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:34,480
Your promotion
to commander
has been confirmed.

282
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,315
You are now captain
of the hotspur.

283
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,417
She must be ready
to sail in two days.

284
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,053
Thank you, sir.

285
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,122
This is not
idol favoritism,
hornblower.

286
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,024
Well, a little tiny.

287
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,992
I need you to be
my eyes and ears.

288
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,695
No one trusts
our new friend bonaparte.

289
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:51,697
Enter.

290
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,037
Ah, captain hornblower,
this is major
andre cotard,

291
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,873
Recently secondered
to the admiralty.

292
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,941
Major cotard,
it's an honor
to meet you, sir.

293
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,477
This is the captain
of the hotspur?

294
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:09,214
Major cotard
is of a noble french family,

295
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:12,451
Who paid dearly
for their opposition
to bonaparte.

296
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,753
But i still have
many well-Placed
contacts in france.

297
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:15,888
I have had word
sent--

298
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:16,955
Well, thank god not all
frenchmen worship

299
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,158
That corsican upstart, huh?

300
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:20,526
May i continue,
admiral?

301
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,527
Of course.
Carry on.

302
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,362
I have had word
sent to me

303
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,997
That an old
and trusted
friend of mine

304
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:27,132
Needs to speak to me
most urgently.

305
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,034
He insists
on meeting
face to face.

306
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,803
It must be important
to warrant the risk.

307
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,705
Exactement.

308
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,773
In 7 days, he sails
from brest

309
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,442
On a british
merchant ship,
the eleanor.

310
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,344
Your ship
is to take me

311
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,079
To rendezvous
with him at sea.

312
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,814
No doubt attracting
the attentions

313
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,182
Of the french,
i take it.

314
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,217
Quite so.
We don't want to give
bony the satisfaction

315
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:49,088
That we violated
the peace treaty.

316
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,256
Right. You'll report
to the hotspur in two days

317
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,959
At 3 bells
in the forenoon watch.

318
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,261
Uh, 3 bells?

319
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,031
9:30 a.M.,
major cotard.

320
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:06,271
The major may appear
a little impertinent,

321
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,841
But i have it
on good authority
he's a faithful ally,

322
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,577
And i have no reason
to question the veracity
of that information.

323
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,879
But?
But...

324
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,648
Men like cotard
have their own agenda.

325
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,217
I understand that,
sir.

326
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,919
Remember, hornblower,
there's folly

327
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,287
And foolhardiness
on one side,

328
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,256
Daring and calculation
on the other.

329
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,591
You make
the right choice,

330
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,527
And i'll see you
through any trouble
that might ensue,

331
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,562
And remember...

332
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,931
Do nothing
to provoke war

333
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,401
Before war is declared.

334
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:38,937
Your mission is vital
for england, sir.

335
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,939
Man: lay on your oars.

336
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:49,848
So what did
the admiral want?

337
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,183
A commander...

338
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,019
For the hotspur.

339
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,088
Congratulations,
horatio.

340
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,623
Sir.

341
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:58,924
They couldn't have
chosen a better man.

342
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:01,093
Thank you.

343
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,561
She's hardly
the renown.

344
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,929
Bush: but she's
a fine ship, sir.

345
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:04,997
Do you think so?

346
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,166
Yes. I think so.

347
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,400
And do you also think,
mr. Bush,

348
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,570
That a lieutenant
who served in a 74

349
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,273
Might be happy
to serve as a lieutenant
in a mere sloop?

350
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:15,741
If you were captain,
sir, i believe
he might.

351
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:20,045
Then would you do me
the honor of being
my first lieutenant?

352
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,014
It is i who would be
honored, sir.

353
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,316
I feared
you wouldn't want to.

354
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:25,584
I feared
you wouldn't ask.

355
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:28,954
Well, we have
a ship to rig.

356
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,123
Aye, aye, captain.

357
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:39,798
Man: lower away.

358
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,400
Handsomely now.
Handsomely.

359
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:42,434
Different man:
steer it
down a jot.

360
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,502
That's it.
Over here.

361
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,670
That's the last
of the water, sir,

362
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:47,139
But we're still
waiting on cordage.

363
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,540
Cannot afford to wait,
mr. Prowse.

364
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:49,842
I'm the master
to the ship, sir,

365
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,610
Not superintendent
of the dock.

366
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,445
Fetch the superintendent
down here.

367
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,880
Sir?
He'll answer
to me,

368
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:55,948
Or he'll answer
to the admiral.

369
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,583
It's his choice.

370
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,951
Aye, aye, sir.

371
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,319
Bush: name?

372
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:01,620
Wolfe, sir.
Thomas wolfe.

373
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,022
Experience?
5 years
as coxswain

374
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,123
On the northern
convoys.

375
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,224
What brings you
to portsmouth?

376
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,458
Uh, a young lady
in leeds, sir,

377
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,394
With a swollen belly
and an angry father.

378
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,162
Sign here, wolfe.

379
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:13,232
Books are full.
No more men.

380
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:15,267
Man: oh, not again.

381
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:19,138
I hear there's
an india one due in
next week.

382
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,773
Wait.
Matthews. Styles.

383
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,608
Captain hornblower,
sir.

384
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:24,576
Good to see you
back in command.

385
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,378
She's a fine ship,
sir.

386
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,180
Uh, we can always find
a place for matthews, sir.

387
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,015
Thank you, sir.

388
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:30,983
Sir?

389
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:35,454
You want to add
to our troubles,
do you, styles?

390
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:38,891
Well, i don't have
a steward yet.

391
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,492
I've been working
in kitchens

392
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,161
These last 3 months, sir.

393
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,931
Styles, you never cease
to amaze me.

394
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:48,901
Thank you, sir.

395
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:50,969
Very well.
I'll take a chance,
mr. Bush.

396
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,871
Make your mark, styles.

397
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:53,972
Aye, aye, sir.

398
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,907
Thank you, sir.

399
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:02,548
Maria:
mr. Hornblower.

400
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,786
You're not
leaving us so,
surely.

401
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,788
My mother's tongue
sometimes runs
away with her.

402
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:12,791
I've been given
command of a ship.
I sail tomorrow.

403
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,895
Then let me pack
for you, sir.

404
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,932
That's very kind,
but there's
precious little here.

405
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,104
Maria...

406
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,441
I'm sorry.

407
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:32,578
I told you not to pin
your hopes on me.

408
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:37,616
I shall never forget
your kindness.

409
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:40,219
For a long time now,
no one ashore
has cared much

410
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,553
Whether i lived
or died.

411
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,956
I care, horatio.
My heart leaps

412
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:45,924
When i hear your
footstep on the stair,

413
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,459
And when
i hear your voice--

414
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:48,694
Please, maria.

415
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:50,996
I know i shouldn't
say these things,
but i must,

416
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:52,598
For i shall
never see you again.

417
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:53,932
I'm sorry.

418
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,805
I have my duty.

419
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,287
Man: come on,
you marines.

420
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,456
Get bellied
by the rail there.

421
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:18,924
Come aboard, sir.

422
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,092
Come aboard, sir.

423
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,093
Bush: names?

424
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,828
Charles orrock, sir.
Midshipman.

425
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:25,564
John hammond, sir.
Midshipman, sir.

426
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:26,565
Well,
as midshipmen,

427
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:27,599
I'll expect you
to know this ship

428
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,034
Like the back
of your hand.

429
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,502
Otherwise, you'll know
the back of mine.
Is that understood?

430
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,770
Sir.

431
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,072
I would like to speak
to the captain, sir,
to thank--

432
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,306
You shall speak
to the captain

433
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:35,941
When you're
spoken to, lad,
and not before.

434
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,676
Now go on below,
both of you, and store
your dunnage.

435
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,578
Aye, aye, sir.
Aye, aye.

436
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:46,952
Ahem.

437
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,554
Sir.

438
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:53,592
Maria.

439
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,196
Mr. Hornblower,
i'm sorry.

440
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:58,530
I'm sorry
for what i said.

441
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:00,599
There's no need to,
truly.

442
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:04,236
I couldn't bear for us
to part on such terms,

443
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,904
So i...

444
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,406
You...

445
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:10,109
I made you these, sir.

446
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:16,715
Gloves.

447
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:19,785
Gloves,
mr. Hornblower.

448
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:23,589
A small token
that you might think
of me sometimes.

449
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:24,890
I need no token, maria.

450
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:30,295
I...

451
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:31,263
Must get back
to the ship.

452
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:35,134
Farewell,
mr. Hornblower.

453
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,177
Maria...

454
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:53,085
Thank you...

455
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:55,654
For the gloves.

456
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,137
Good morning, major.

457
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:13,205
Man: you there!

458
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,974
Sail up and clear
that bunt line!

459
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:17,242
Different man:
aye, aye, sir!

460
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,310
You are...

461
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:20,012
William bush,
first lieutenant.

462
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,747
Have my bag
put in my cabin, bush,

463
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:22,815
And take me
to the captain.

464
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,016
May i see
your orders, sir?

465
00:21:24,084 --> 00:21:27,386
Your captain
will not like to be
kept waiting.

466
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:28,487
Neither do i.

467
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:30,055
Show me your orders, sir,
and he won't be.

468
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:39,264
You're a frenchman.

469
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:41,500
You object?

470
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:43,369
No, sir.
We all serve the king.

471
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:46,338
Matthews,
have the major's dunnage
stored in my quarters.

472
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:47,573
Aye, aye, sir.

473
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,274
Man: boat ahoy!

474
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:50,476
Different man:
hotspur!

475
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:55,881
Captain's
coming on, sir.

476
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:57,816
Very well.
Boatswain's mates.

477
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:59,952
Side, boys. Lively. Ho!

478
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:02,955
Man: present. Hut!

479
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:21,240
God's blood,
what has he got
in here?

480
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:22,541
Provisions.

481
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:25,244
Provisions?
Where are we going,
the west indies?

482
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:30,883
Will that be all, sir?

483
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,484
For the present,
styles.

484
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:34,753
I didn't catch
your name.

485
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:37,056
Uh, wolfe, sir.
Your coxswain.

486
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:39,191
Worry about where
we're headed when
we get there, wolfe.

487
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:42,761
Major cotard, captain.

488
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:45,130
Ah.

489
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:46,999
You are welcome
in this ship, major.

490
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:49,168
Glad to hear it.
That will be all.

491
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:53,639
Slack water now, sir.
First of the ebb
in 10 minutes.

492
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:54,840
Anchors offshore.

493
00:22:54,908 --> 00:22:57,409
Thank you, mr. Bush.
I shall be up
presently.

494
00:22:57,477 --> 00:23:01,847
I was expecting
a somewhat larger vessel.

495
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:03,582
Don't judge
a ship by the number
of its guns, major,

496
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,184
But by the skill
of its crew.

497
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,219
The hotspur
is more than equal
to the task.

498
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:08,787
You will make
your rendezvous.

499
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:11,757
Ahem.

500
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:14,560
Stand by there
at the capstan!

501
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,495
Thank you, mr. Prowse.
Mr. Bush will take her out.

502
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:17,996
Bush:
aye, aye, sir.

503
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,231
Loose the headsails!

504
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:21,667
Matthews: loose
the headsails!

505
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,572
Haul away there!

506
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:29,074
Come on!
Put your backs
into it!

507
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,247
Stand by to loose
the topsail!

508
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:37,583
Stand by to loose
the topsail!

509
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,985
Heave away
at the capstan!

510
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:43,856
Come on!
Do it now!

511
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,424
Loose the topsail!

512
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:47,292
Let go!

513
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:02,808
Mr. Bush, we'll have
an hour's exercise
at the guns

514
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:04,943
As soon as we're out
in the channel.

515
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:07,246
You never know.
One of these days,
we may have to use them.

516
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:08,647
Aye, aye, sir.

517
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:10,516
Hands to quarters!

518
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:13,052
Matthews: hands to quarters!

519
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:16,522
Sir.

520
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:18,924
I'd like some breakfast,
please, styles.

521
00:24:18,992 --> 00:24:20,726
Two fried eggs,
a sausage,

522
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,294
And some black pudding.

523
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:23,429
Oh, and some coffee.

524
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:25,264
Coffee, sir?
Yes. Coffee.

525
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:29,234
You do know
how to make coffee?

526
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,203
Oh, yes, sir.

527
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:33,439
Bush: cast loose your gun!

528
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:34,506
Cast loose!

529
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:35,808
Cast loose.

530
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,609
Cast loose! Come on!

531
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:39,345
Best bawl your lungs out,
mr. Hammond, sir.

532
00:24:39,412 --> 00:24:40,913
You won't be heard
otherwise.

533
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,881
Ahem. How do you
make coffee?

534
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:44,917
Ha! Do i look
like a cook?

535
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,885
You and your big mouth.

536
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:48,120
Run out your gun!

537
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:49,121
Run out!

538
00:24:49,189 --> 00:24:50,522
[Voice breaking]
run out!

539
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,225
Run out your guns!
Jump to it!

540
00:24:53,293 --> 00:24:54,793
Orrock: run out!

541
00:24:58,631 --> 00:24:59,665
Fire!

542
00:25:02,102 --> 00:25:03,469
Fire!

543
00:25:07,774 --> 00:25:10,376
Orrock: cease fire!

544
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:11,710
Stand by
your guns.

545
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:19,852
Mr. Orrock,
what are your orders

546
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,487
Regarding lanterns
during a night action?

547
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,756
I'm to wait until
mr. Bush expressly
orders them, sir.

548
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,491
Then i send
mr. Hammond.

549
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,329
Where do you go,
mr. Hammond?

550
00:25:30,397 --> 00:25:32,331
For the lanterns?

551
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:33,966
I...i...

552
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:35,434
Don't look to mr. Orrock.

553
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:39,505
Forward, sir?

554
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:41,140
Yes, mr. Hammond.
Forward.

555
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,408
Thank you, matthews.

556
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:43,676
Sir.

557
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:44,943
Bush: rest assured, sir,

558
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,413
Mr. Hammond will be
warmly reminded
of his duties.

559
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,816
I won't have to speak
to you again, will i,
mr. Hammond?

560
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:53,185
Capitaine hornblower,

561
00:25:53,253 --> 00:25:55,621
If this is a joke,
it is in poor taste.

562
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:57,656
Sir, only the captain's steward
may enter without knocking.

563
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:59,358
What's the problem,
major cotard?

564
00:25:59,426 --> 00:26:01,760
Do you seriously
expect me to sleep

565
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:03,195
In a mildewed
canvas bag

566
00:26:03,263 --> 00:26:04,329
With the common crew?

567
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,432
I thought he was
sharing your berth.

568
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:07,566
He is.

569
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:09,935
Behind
a filthy curtain.

570
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:12,971
I have shared a berth
with lieutenant bush,
major cotard,

571
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,807
And i consider it
an honor.

572
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:18,210
The admiral
required you to show--

573
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:20,446
On this ship,
i am the admiral.

574
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:22,014
If you are not
satisfied with
your quarters,

575
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:24,049
You have my permission
to sleep on deck.

576
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:26,018
Your breakfast,
sir.

577
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:28,620
Now, major,
will you join us?

578
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:30,723
I am not hungry.

579
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,724
Good day
to you, sir.

580
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:43,802
Sorry about
the delay, sir.

581
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,137
Still finding me way
around the galley.

582
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:47,272
Bush: styles,
what's this?

583
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,376
Uh, fried eggs, sausage,
and some lovely black pudding.

584
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:51,844
As ordered, sir.

585
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:53,612
I'm just boiling
the coffee now, sir.

586
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,780
I'll go fetch it.

587
00:26:58,485 --> 00:26:59,852
But coffee
shouldn't be--

588
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,488
Boiled, william?
I know. I know.

589
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:04,523
Bush: raise up
that main yard!

590
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:12,131
Aah!

591
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:15,267
Damnation.

592
00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:23,575
Hmm.

593
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:28,747
You worked in a kitchen
for 3 months.

594
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:29,782
Yes, sir.

595
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,083
Don't lie to me,
styles.

596
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:34,019
I'll string you up
by your thumbs.

597
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:36,188
It were a prison
kitchen, sir.

598
00:27:36,256 --> 00:27:37,489
I were doing 3 months
for fraying.

599
00:27:37,557 --> 00:27:40,592
Did you think
to make a fool of
the captain, styles?

600
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,728
No, sir.
Learn to cook,

601
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:44,530
Or i'll cook you.
You understand me?

602
00:27:44,597 --> 00:27:46,131
Sir.

603
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:52,204
Were your customers
this fussy
in the clink?

604
00:27:52,272 --> 00:27:53,639
Put it this way.

605
00:27:53,707 --> 00:27:57,276
I never got flogged
for me cooking it,
if that's what you mean.

606
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,044
Oh, there's worse
than being flogged.

607
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:01,347
Mr. Bush might
make you eat that...

608
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:04,350
And then flog you.

609
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:12,658
Prowse: that sail
is set, sir.

610
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:16,228
Very good, mr. Prowse.
Again, please.

611
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:18,797
Again, sir?

612
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:23,535
Mr. Prowse, how long
have you been at sea?

613
00:28:23,603 --> 00:28:25,971
30 years, sir,
12 as master.

614
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,340
Good.

615
00:28:28,408 --> 00:28:31,010
I respect
your experience
and your skills, sir.

616
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:33,645
In return, i'd like you
to respect mine.

617
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:35,681
One more exercise
at the headsails,

618
00:28:35,749 --> 00:28:37,316
And then put the ship
abound, please.

619
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:40,919
Aye, aye, sir.

620
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:43,555
Strike the headsails!

621
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:51,930
Aah!

622
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:55,334
Aah! Aah! Aah!

623
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:57,670
God almighty!

624
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,672
Wolfe: get overboard!
Get overboard!

625
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:01,607
Leave him! Leave him!
Get overboard!

626
00:29:01,675 --> 00:29:03,942
Hornblower:
stand fast there!

627
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,377
Major quarters!

628
00:29:05,445 --> 00:29:07,813
Mr. Prowse,
get a team on the pump!

629
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:10,949
Aye, aye, sir!
Below there, man the pump!

630
00:29:16,723 --> 00:29:18,190
Hold that aside,
mr. Bush!

631
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:19,491
Matthews!

632
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:20,526
Matthews:
aye, aye, sir!

633
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:32,171
Finish pumping!

634
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:33,238
Man:
finish pumping!

635
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:36,275
The doors
to the stove, sir.

636
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:38,977
They've been left
wide open.

637
00:29:42,315 --> 00:29:44,550
I secured
the range, sir.
I swear, i did.

638
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:47,353
Then how did hot coals
get scattered all over
the deck?

639
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,320
I don't know, sir.

640
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:49,588
Take him below.

641
00:29:54,094 --> 00:29:55,861
I hope this will not
delay us, captain.

642
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:59,164
It almost delayed us
permanently, major.

643
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:03,068
But we are
still afloat.

644
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:05,170
Let us at least
be grateful for that.

645
00:30:08,942 --> 00:30:10,676
The cook.
He should hang.

646
00:30:10,744 --> 00:30:12,511
That's for the captain
to decide.

647
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:16,348
All hands
to witness punishment!

648
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:21,353
Man: this is silly.
It wasn't his fault.

649
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,061
Well, styles,

650
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:31,363
You have endangered
his majesty's ship

651
00:30:31,431 --> 00:30:33,165
And the lives
of your fellows.

652
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:34,600
What do you
have to say?

653
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:35,768
Wasn't me, sir.

654
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:38,671
Does anyone have
anything to say
on his behalf?

655
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:45,377
Hornblower: if he
is found to have
acted maliciously,

656
00:30:45,445 --> 00:30:48,681
The articles of war
provide for only
one sentence...

657
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:52,184
Death.

658
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:54,019
Bush: i believe it may
have been an accident, sir.

659
00:30:54,087 --> 00:30:56,588
He was negligent,
not malicious.

660
00:30:58,758 --> 00:31:00,392
Very well.

661
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,460
Seize him up.

662
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:07,866
Hats off.

663
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:11,937
Hornblower:
"article 36--

664
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:14,173
"All other crimes
not capital
committed

665
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,408
"By any person
or persons
in the fleet

666
00:31:16,476 --> 00:31:18,677
"Which are not
mentioned in this act

667
00:31:18,745 --> 00:31:20,045
"Or for which

668
00:31:20,113 --> 00:31:21,880
"Is hereby directed

669
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:23,649
"Shall be punished
according to the laws

670

And customs
used at sea."

671
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,157
3 dozen,
mr. Matthews.

672
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:15,467
Uh!

673
00:32:33,086 --> 00:32:35,220
I've never seen
so much blood.

674
00:32:37,924 --> 00:32:39,925
Bush: 3 dozen, sir.

675
00:32:39,993 --> 00:32:40,926
Take him down,
mr. Bush.

676
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:42,795
Take him down!

677
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:51,837
Thank you, mr. Bush.
Dismiss all hands.

678
00:32:51,905 --> 00:32:53,539
All hands dismissed!

679
00:33:02,215 --> 00:33:03,916
I didn't do it, sir.

680
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:13,926
Man: clear that mizzen
coming in!

681
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:18,130
Land ho!

682
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,767
There is no sign
of the eleanor,
captain.

683
00:33:21,835 --> 00:33:23,869
Is your contact
reliable?

684
00:33:23,937 --> 00:33:26,638
My contact
is the duke
of montreuil.

685
00:33:26,706 --> 00:33:29,241
He has always been
a man of his word.

686
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:32,544
Hornblower:
our arrival has been noted,
judging by that semaphore tower.

687
00:33:32,612 --> 00:33:34,813
It was not there
6 months ago.

688
00:33:36,383 --> 00:33:38,083
It'll be part
of a chain.

689
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:40,319
By now,
they will know of us

690
00:33:40,387 --> 00:33:44,056
In brest
and in paris
within the hour,

691
00:33:44,124 --> 00:33:46,692
And that battery
will have been reinforced.

692
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:52,798
Hold on.
This'll sting.

693
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:55,434
Hold fast.
Hold fast.

694
00:33:55,502 --> 00:33:57,903
Just vinegar
and brown paper.

695
00:33:57,971 --> 00:34:00,973
It'll help
your wounds heal.

696
00:34:02,842 --> 00:34:04,276
Why are you here?

697
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:05,778
Nothing cheers me up

698
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:09,615
Like seeing another
poor bugger in pain.

699
00:34:09,683 --> 00:34:12,785
I didn't do it.
I told them.

700
00:34:12,852 --> 00:34:15,454
Styles, you've served
the crown long enough.

701
00:34:15,522 --> 00:34:17,456
What did you expect?

702
00:34:21,428 --> 00:34:23,562
Sail ho!

703
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:26,532
Flying on
the larboard bow!

704
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:28,867
Glass.

705
00:34:36,209 --> 00:34:38,143
Is it the eleanor?

706
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,713
Mr. Orrock, we'll hoist
our colors, if you please.

707
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,581
Aye, aye, sir.

708
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:47,453
Should you not
signal to them?

709
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,121
I would, major,
were she a british ship.

710
00:34:49,189 --> 00:34:50,456
She's a french
frigate, sir.

711
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:52,858
In the very place
at the very time
of our rendezvous?

712
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:54,660
It may be a coincidence.

713
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:03,435
She's closing fast, sir.
Shall i alter course?

714
00:35:03,503 --> 00:35:06,305
Keep her steady
as she goes,
mr. Prowse.

715
00:35:06,373 --> 00:35:07,906
Clear
for action, sir?

716
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:09,608
We're at peace
with france,
mr. Bush.

717
00:35:09,676 --> 00:35:11,877
Or we were
when we left england.

718
00:35:15,749 --> 00:35:18,283
40 guns to our 20, sir.
18-Pounders.

719
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:19,418
Thank you,
mr. Prowse.

720
00:35:19,486 --> 00:35:20,686
She's have us in range
in two minutes, sir.

721
00:35:20,754 --> 00:35:21,687
Thank you.

722
00:35:21,755 --> 00:35:24,256
You don't trust her,
do you sir?

723
00:35:27,994 --> 00:35:29,728
In range of her broadside
in one minute, sir.

724
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:33,132
So she has twice our guns,
4 times our firepower.

725
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,267
We must clear for action.

726
00:35:36,736 --> 00:35:37,803
No, mr. Bush.

727
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:40,105
We will render
passing honors.

728
00:35:40,173 --> 00:35:41,874
Passing honors
to a frenchman, sir?

729
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:43,842
Hornblower: there's
a first time for
everything, mr. Bush.

730
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:46,278
You do remember
the procedure.

731
00:35:48,081 --> 00:35:50,049
Aye, aye, sir.

732
00:35:50,116 --> 00:35:52,084
All hands man the sides!

733
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:53,919
Sergeant of marines,
parade your men!

734
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:56,622
Matthews: all right!
Man the sides!

735
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:59,425
Jump to it!
Pick those feet up!

736
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,931
Quietly now,
drummer on the right.

737
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:07,232
Boatswain's mates,
pipe on my command.

738
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,500
Aye, aye, sir.

739
00:36:08,568 --> 00:36:11,570
Bush: toe the line there.
Toe the line.

740
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:15,808
Heads up. Keep still.

741
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:20,846
Show these frogs
how a british crew behaves.

742
00:36:20,914 --> 00:36:22,281
Let them have it,
mr. Bush.

743
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:23,515
Drum.

744
00:36:26,453 --> 00:36:28,587
Present...arms!

745
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:36,028
Pipes!

746
00:36:44,704 --> 00:36:46,572
For what we're
about to receive...

747
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:55,247
Bush: order...arms!

748
00:36:58,151 --> 00:36:59,585
Cotard: the loire.

749
00:37:04,758 --> 00:37:06,325
Well, i'll be damned.
I never thought i'd get

750
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:07,960
A salute from
a french frigate.

751
00:37:08,028 --> 00:37:11,530
Question is,
what was that french
frigate doing here?

752
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:16,769
And what has happened
to your friend the duke?

753
00:37:16,836 --> 00:37:18,470
Oh, sheer folly.

754
00:37:19,939 --> 00:37:21,840
Hornblower: major cotard
was supposed to meet
his contact

755
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:23,776
On board
a british ship.

756
00:37:23,843 --> 00:37:26,045
Now there's
no sign of either.

757
00:37:26,112 --> 00:37:27,913
Bony is up
to something
along this coast,

758
00:37:27,981 --> 00:37:28,981
And we must find out
what it is.

759
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:30,516
Yes, but i'm not sure
i trust major cotard

760
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:33,152
To be the one
to investigate it.

761
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:34,586
Nor me.

762
00:37:34,654 --> 00:37:37,623
Not enough to let him
go alone, anyway.

763
00:37:37,691 --> 00:37:38,590
Now...

764
00:37:38,658 --> 00:37:40,325
How do i look?

765
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:44,163
Like a pale,
thin englishman
with a poor tailor.

766
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:48,934
Sir, if they catch you,
you'll be shot as a spy,
peace or no peace.

767
00:37:49,002 --> 00:37:50,202
I know, mr. Bush.

768
00:37:52,906 --> 00:37:53,839
Johnny boat
is ready, sir.

769
00:37:53,907 --> 00:37:55,574
She's rigged with
nets and floats.

770
00:37:55,642 --> 00:37:56,575
She should pass
for a fishing boat.

771
00:37:56,643 --> 00:37:57,609
Thank you.

772
00:37:57,677 --> 00:37:59,378
I'll just
get aboard.

773
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:00,379
Oh, there's no need.
We'll row ourselves.

774
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:01,480
Begging
your pardon, sir.

775
00:38:01,548 --> 00:38:02,815
Just you
and that frenchman?

776
00:38:02,882 --> 00:38:03,916
Oh, the exercise
will do us good.

777
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:05,584
Aye, aye, sir.

778
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,787
If i'm not back
by the second dog watch,

779
00:38:08,855 --> 00:38:10,189
You are to sail
to portsmouth

780
00:38:10,256 --> 00:38:12,358
And see that this report
gets to the flagship.
Sir...

781
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:14,326
You are in command,
mr. Bush.

782
00:38:14,394 --> 00:38:17,596
Now take
good care of her.

783
00:38:17,664 --> 00:38:19,131
Aye, aye, sir.

784
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,685
You said the captain
was a clever man.

785
00:38:39,753 --> 00:38:40,919
He is.

786
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:42,788
Not bloody clever
going ashore

787
00:38:42,856 --> 00:38:45,424
With only that frog
dandy for company.

788
00:38:45,492 --> 00:38:47,126
Better tell him that
when he comes back.

789
00:38:47,193 --> 00:38:50,162
You mean,
if he comes back.

790
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,565
Maybe he'd rather have
a frenchman in front of him

791
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:55,434
Than an irishman
behind him.

792
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:57,369
Matthews, half
this navy is irish.

793
00:38:57,437 --> 00:39:00,339
If we were
all disloyal,
you'd be sunk.

794
00:39:00,407 --> 00:39:04,510
Wasn't so long ago
i came across a paddy
serving on a french ship.

795
00:39:04,577 --> 00:39:06,078
Fancied himself
as a rebel.

796
00:39:06,146 --> 00:39:08,414
Hope you won't tar all irishmen
with the same brush, matthews.

797
00:39:08,481 --> 00:39:09,548
Sir, no, sir.

798
00:39:09,616 --> 00:39:10,883
Sorry, sir.
No offense.

799
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,685
Carry on.

800
00:39:21,995 --> 00:39:25,631
All this coastland
used to belong to
the duke of montreuil.

801
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,169
I spent my childhood
playing here.

802
00:39:30,236 --> 00:39:32,504
This must
be a bitter
homecoming.

803
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,575
It breaks my heart
to see a noble nation

804
00:39:36,643 --> 00:39:41,714
Debase itself before
a man like bonaparte.

805
00:39:41,781 --> 00:39:44,283
You find it strange that
i should love my country

806
00:39:44,351 --> 00:39:46,218
And still
fight against it?

807
00:39:46,286 --> 00:39:48,320
As long as you fight
against it, major,

808
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:50,222
That's all
that concerns me.

809
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:38,504
Bonaparte has been busy
during the peace.

810
00:40:38,571 --> 00:40:40,005
Peace?

811
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:42,408
This camp is for
an invasion force,
major.

812
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:45,110
We must get word
to admiral pellew.

813
00:40:49,049 --> 00:40:50,916
For god's sakes,
major!

814
00:41:26,953 --> 00:41:29,154
Hornblower:
you wait here.

815
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:53,712
Half an hour
into the second
dog watch, sir.

816
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,648
I can tell the time,
mr. Prowse.

817
00:41:59,252 --> 00:42:02,955
Now is not the time
to make a stand, major!

818
00:42:17,837 --> 00:42:20,439
Damn semaphore has
started up again.

819
00:42:20,507 --> 00:42:23,809
Man: deck there! Sail ho!

820
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:25,110
Where away?

821
00:42:25,178 --> 00:42:27,846
Coming down
the fairway, sir!

822
00:42:31,451 --> 00:42:32,718
It's our old friend
the loire.

823
00:42:32,786 --> 00:42:33,886
We better get
underway, mr. Bush.

824
00:42:33,953 --> 00:42:36,221
We've stayed
too long already.

825
00:42:40,026 --> 00:42:42,061
Mr. Bush?
I heard you,
mr. Prowse.

826
00:42:42,128 --> 00:42:44,196
She's altered course
towards us, sir.

827
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:49,535
Sir.

828
00:42:49,602 --> 00:42:51,737
Very well. Come
onto the larboard tack.
Set a course for home.

829
00:42:51,805 --> 00:42:53,639
We'll show them
a clean pair of heels.

830
00:42:53,707 --> 00:42:55,607
We'll be lucky
if we can do that.

831
00:42:55,675 --> 00:42:57,343
Set the headsails!

832
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,511
Brace up the mainmast!

833
00:43:05,552 --> 00:43:07,119
Capitaine, look.

834
00:43:07,187 --> 00:43:09,922
The hotspur
is still there.

835
00:43:09,989 --> 00:43:12,424
Thank god
for english
inefficiency, huh?

836
00:43:14,794 --> 00:43:17,162
She's heading
out to sea.

837
00:43:18,598 --> 00:43:19,965
Hey!

838
00:43:20,033 --> 00:43:21,800
Ahoy!

839
00:43:21,868 --> 00:43:22,801
Hey!

840
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:24,136
Ahoy!

841
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:27,573
Prowse: they're
catching up, sir.

842
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,774
Styles: sir.

843
00:43:28,842 --> 00:43:29,775
Sir.

844
00:43:29,843 --> 00:43:30,943
Not now, styles,
for god's sake.

845
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:32,544
Not bloody now?
Styles!

846
00:43:32,612 --> 00:43:34,680
Sir, it's them!
It's the captain.

847
00:43:34,748 --> 00:43:36,048
On the larboard
corner, sir!

848
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:39,184
Hornblower: ahoy! Ahoy!

849
00:43:39,252 --> 00:43:41,153
Bush: my god,
it is them.

850
00:43:41,221 --> 00:43:43,022
All hands
to wear ship!

851
00:43:43,089 --> 00:43:44,456
Mr. Prowse, we'll
stand in towards.

852
00:43:44,524 --> 00:43:46,692
The frigate is cleared
for action, sir,
if we're at war.

853
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,028
Bush: hard aport!

854
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,498
They've seen us.

855
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:00,973
Capitaine...

856
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:02,174
The loire.

857
00:44:03,943 --> 00:44:06,345
Put your back
into it, major.

858
00:44:25,065 --> 00:44:29,101
For a moment there, sir,
we wondered which ship
you were headed for.

859
00:44:29,169 --> 00:44:30,469
Still here,
then, mr. Bush?

860
00:44:30,537 --> 00:44:32,371
Thought the hour glass
was running
a little fast, sir.

861
00:44:32,439 --> 00:44:34,940
We're in range
of her bow chasers,
sir.

862
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:36,275
Raise her hard up,
mr. Prowse.

863
00:44:36,343 --> 00:44:38,143
Mr. Bush,
clear for action.

864
00:44:38,211 --> 00:44:40,279
Aye, aye, sir.
Clear for action!

865
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:43,282
Prowse: raise up
the mainmast!

866
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:52,024
Thank you, styles.

867
00:44:56,229 --> 00:44:57,996
Begging
your pardon, sir.

868
00:44:58,064 --> 00:45:00,165
On behalf of the hands,
are we at war, sir?

869
00:45:00,233 --> 00:45:02,234
The frogs know,
and we don't yet,
matthews.

870
00:45:02,302 --> 00:45:04,169
Very good, sir.

871
00:45:07,107 --> 00:45:08,374
They're catching us
fast, sir.

872
00:45:08,441 --> 00:45:09,541
We'll have
to come about, sir.

873
00:45:09,609 --> 00:45:10,976
We'll be on the shore
in 5 minutes.

874
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:12,478
As soon as we
come about,
they'll have us.

875
00:45:17,751 --> 00:45:19,618
Hornblower: mr. Matthews!
Get those halyards reroped!

876
00:45:19,686 --> 00:45:21,120
Aye, aye, sir!
And matthews,

877
00:45:21,187 --> 00:45:26,525
If you think it proper,
you can tell the hands
that we are at war.

878
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:30,662
Come on.
Move yourselves.

879
00:45:33,967 --> 00:45:37,102
Mr. Orrock, i want you
to take 4 men up forward.

880
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:38,971
I shall be
going about shortly,

881
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,739
But then i shall
change my mind.

882
00:45:40,807 --> 00:45:42,408
When i signal,
you are to run the jib up

883
00:45:42,475 --> 00:45:44,243
And flat it out
to starboard.
Understood?

884
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:45,377
Aye, aye, sir.

885
00:45:46,646 --> 00:45:47,913
Stand by to go about!

886
00:45:47,981 --> 00:45:49,748
Standing by, sir.

887
00:45:51,317 --> 00:45:53,886
Now, mr. Prowse,
keep an eye
on that frenchman.

888
00:45:53,953 --> 00:45:55,421
I want to know
exactly what he does.

889
00:45:55,488 --> 00:45:56,488
Aye, aye, sir.

890
00:45:57,991 --> 00:45:58,924
Helms alee!

891
00:45:58,992 --> 00:46:01,794
Matthews:
helms alee!

892
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:18,677
He's following
us, sir.

893
00:46:20,413 --> 00:46:22,181
Avast!

894
00:46:22,248 --> 00:46:23,882
Brace all back again!

895
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,317
Rrgh!

896
00:46:25,385 --> 00:46:26,318
Mr. Orrock!

897
00:46:26,386 --> 00:46:28,554
Aye, aye, sir!
Set the headsail!

898
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:30,055
Hard aport!

899
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:33,092
Matthews:
hard aport, sir!

900
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:35,160
Orrock:
drop the headsail!

901
00:46:35,228 --> 00:46:36,929
Hang the headsail!

902
00:46:52,012 --> 00:46:53,178
Volley fire!

903
00:46:53,246 --> 00:46:55,347
Make ready!

904
00:46:55,415 --> 00:46:58,317
They tried to follow us,
sir, but he's been
taken all aback!

905
00:46:58,385 --> 00:46:59,485
He's helpless!

906
00:46:59,552 --> 00:47:00,552
Present!

907
00:47:02,088 --> 00:47:03,689
We'll render passing
honors, mr. Bush.

908
00:47:03,757 --> 00:47:05,124
Aye, aye, sir.

909
00:47:05,191 --> 00:47:07,693
Gunners, hold your fire
until the mainmast
is in your sights!

910
00:47:07,761 --> 00:47:08,794
Run out!

911
00:47:08,862 --> 00:47:10,629
Matthews: run out!

912
00:47:15,435 --> 00:47:17,036
Run out,
mr. Hammond!

913
00:47:17,103 --> 00:47:18,837
Styles: thought
you might use a hand
with the guns, sir!

914
00:47:18,905 --> 00:47:20,039
Good man,
styles.

915
00:47:20,106 --> 00:47:22,341
Rather see you
on the gundeck
than the galley.

916
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:25,144
Come on, sir,
unless you want to get
your leg blown off!

917
00:47:25,211 --> 00:47:27,379
Stand by!

918
00:47:27,447 --> 00:47:28,781
Fire!

919
00:47:35,088 --> 00:47:36,655
Man: fire!

920
00:47:36,723 --> 00:47:38,323
Damn!

921
00:47:38,391 --> 00:47:40,092
She's coming
round, sir.

922
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:46,198
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!

923
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:48,834
Wolfe: oh, god.

924
00:47:53,506 --> 00:47:54,540
Reload!

925
00:47:54,607 --> 00:47:56,342
Man: powder monkey!
Over here!

926
00:47:58,945 --> 00:48:00,479
Aah! Aah! Aah!

927
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:07,686
Shut your face!
Shut it, damn you!

928
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:09,088
Waah!

929
00:48:09,155 --> 00:48:12,524
Come on. You're all right.
It's not your blood, sir.

930
00:48:12,592 --> 00:48:14,026
What is it, matthews?

931
00:48:14,094 --> 00:48:15,160
Aah! Mmph!

932
00:48:15,228 --> 00:48:17,596
It's all
under control, sir.

933
00:48:17,664 --> 00:48:21,567
One more peep out of you,
and no one can save you.

934
00:48:21,634 --> 00:48:25,170
You'll be going
over the side
with that lot.

935
00:48:25,238 --> 00:48:28,040
Do you understand?
Do you understand?!

936
00:48:28,108 --> 00:48:29,475
Come on, you bugger.

937
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,280
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!

938
00:48:35,348 --> 00:48:38,917
Hooray!
Yay!
Hooray!

939
00:48:43,023 --> 00:48:47,126
Do we come to the wind,
sir, and finish her off?

940
00:48:49,195 --> 00:48:52,264
Let's not
overplay our hand,
mr. Prowse.

941
00:48:52,332 --> 00:48:54,600
We'll have drifted in range
of those batteries
within 5 minutes.

942
00:48:54,668 --> 00:48:57,569
Every shot tolled, sir,
every single shot.

943
00:48:57,637 --> 00:48:58,971
Indeed they did,
mr. Bush.

944
00:49:00,373 --> 00:49:02,941
I think we've overstayed
our welcome here.

945
00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:06,578
Mr. Prowse,
plot a course for home.

946
00:49:12,952 --> 00:49:16,055
Pellew: you had no business
to take on the loire, man!

947
00:49:16,122 --> 00:49:18,057
She might have blown
you out of the water!

948
00:49:18,124 --> 00:49:20,125
It would have been
folly not to, sir.

949
00:49:20,193 --> 00:49:22,661
Oh, there's folly
and foolhardiness
on the one side

950
00:49:22,729 --> 00:49:25,731
And daring and calculation
on the other, eh?

951
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:27,166
Something
like that, sir.

952
00:49:27,233 --> 00:49:28,734
Very good.

953
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:31,170
You made
the right choice.

954
00:49:32,939 --> 00:49:35,140
I'd like to know
what the loire

955
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:36,942
Was doing there
in the first place.

956
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:40,245
One french ship
outside a french port?

957
00:49:40,313 --> 00:49:42,348
That's hardly rotten.

958
00:49:42,415 --> 00:49:45,784
At the exact
hour and place
as our rendezvous

959
00:49:45,852 --> 00:49:47,586
With the duke
of montreuil?

960
00:49:47,654 --> 00:49:49,388
Well, the only one privy
to that information
was myself

961
00:49:49,456 --> 00:49:53,792
Or major cotard
or some good men
of the admiralty.

962
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,663
Perhaps you should talk
to those good men, sir,

963
00:49:57,731 --> 00:49:59,064
Or major cotard.

964
00:49:59,132 --> 00:50:02,868
I will not doubt
major cotard because
he's a frenchman.

965
00:50:02,936 --> 00:50:06,772
God, he risked his life
for england, damn it.

966
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,340
Nevertheless,

967
00:50:08,408 --> 00:50:11,210
I feel we must
doubt someone, sir.

968
00:50:11,277 --> 00:50:15,848
Indeed, if we
have agents familiar
with our enemies' plans,

969
00:50:15,915 --> 00:50:18,917
It seems reasonable
to assume that
the enemy has, too.

970
00:50:18,985 --> 00:50:20,552
Hmm.

971
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,888
I'll make some
discreet inquiries.

972
00:50:22,956 --> 00:50:24,023
In the meantime,

973
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:26,291
I want you back
watching brest

974
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:28,761
Until i get
the channel fleet
to sea.

975
00:50:28,828 --> 00:50:30,763
You sail
on the morning tide
first of the ebb.

976
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:31,964
Aye, aye, sir.

977
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:34,299
Well, there's hours, yet.
Come on. Finish your wine.

978
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,568
I, uh, beg
your pardon, sir.

979
00:50:36,636 --> 00:50:40,339
I had hoped to visit
a friend before
i embarked.

980
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:42,541
A friend?
A lady friend?

981
00:50:42,609 --> 00:50:43,542
You do know,
hornblower,

982
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,644
That in time of war,
a captain may not

983
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:48,614
Sleep out of his ship
without his admiral's
permission.

984
00:50:48,682 --> 00:50:50,482
I hadn't intended
to sleep, sir.

985
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:51,917
Oh, well--

986
00:50:51,985 --> 00:50:53,619
I didn't mean--
Well,
permission granted.

987
00:50:53,687 --> 00:50:55,521
Thank you, sir.

988
00:50:55,588 --> 00:50:59,324
Well, maybe you
won't sleep ashore for
the next couple of years,

989
00:50:59,392 --> 00:51:01,460
Maybe more if bony
fights it out.

990
00:51:01,528 --> 00:51:04,296
I certainly think
he'll fight, sir.

991
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:06,799
In that case,
we'll meet again

992
00:51:06,866 --> 00:51:07,766
All flushed.

993
00:51:09,803 --> 00:51:11,136
Victorious war...

994
00:51:11,204 --> 00:51:13,272
And beauty ashore.

995
00:51:17,877 --> 00:51:19,678
You, sir,
what are you doing?

996
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:22,314
What does it look
like i'm doing?

997
00:51:22,382 --> 00:51:24,216
Oh, sorry, sir.

998
00:51:24,284 --> 00:51:26,051
Well, they're
bankrupt, sir.

999
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:29,121
Seems the old girl
drank the rent.

1000
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:51,910
Mrs. Mason: well, well...

1001
00:51:51,978 --> 00:51:54,646
If it isn't
the grand sea captain

1002
00:51:54,714 --> 00:51:56,715
Come to sneer
at our misfortune.

1003
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:58,650
Mr. Hornblower, sir.

1004
00:51:58,718 --> 00:52:00,285
Maria.

1005
00:52:00,353 --> 00:52:01,420
I'm ashamed, sir,

1006
00:52:01,488 --> 00:52:04,490
That you should
see us like this.

1007
00:52:04,557 --> 00:52:05,924
Oh, don't be,
i beg you.

1008
00:52:05,992 --> 00:52:08,360
It happened
so quickly.

1009
00:52:08,428 --> 00:52:10,729
I didn't know
we were in arrears,

1010
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:13,032
And the bailiff
did not listen,

1011
00:52:13,099 --> 00:52:14,833
And now we can't
earn our release.

1012
00:52:14,901 --> 00:52:17,136
We wouldn't have been in arrears
if he'd paid his rent.

1013
00:52:17,203 --> 00:52:20,239
I did pay my rent,
madam.

1014
00:52:20,306 --> 00:52:22,541
I can see what
you did with it.

1015
00:52:24,277 --> 00:52:27,046
I never thought
i'd see you again.

1016
00:52:27,113 --> 00:52:31,483
You were my friend
in the time
of need, maria.

1017
00:52:31,551 --> 00:52:33,919
Allow me to be yours.

1018
00:52:33,987 --> 00:52:35,721
Maria:
no, mr. Hornblower.
You mustn't.

1019
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:38,290
It's too late, maria.
It's been done.

1020
00:52:51,371 --> 00:52:53,572
I don't know
what to say.

1021
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,208
You could ask him
what he wants
in exchange.

1022
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:58,110
Mother!
Say nothing.

1023
00:52:58,178 --> 00:53:01,080
Just go and pay
your debts.

1024
00:53:07,087 --> 00:53:08,987
Thank you,
mr. Hornblower, sir.

1025
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:25,471
If mr. Mason
were here,

1026
00:53:25,538 --> 00:53:27,539
He would not
accept your charity.

1027
00:53:27,607 --> 00:53:30,876
But he is not here
and seems conspicuous
by his absence.

1028
00:53:30,944 --> 00:53:31,944
He died, sir,

1029
00:53:32,012 --> 00:53:34,713
Fighting for king
and country.

1030
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:38,650
He served in hannibal
at gibraltar.

1031
00:53:38,718 --> 00:53:40,919
I will not allow
my maria

1032
00:53:40,987 --> 00:53:43,555
To suffer as i
have suffered, sir.

1033
00:53:43,623 --> 00:53:46,625
Oh, you may be
heroes to your ship,

1034
00:53:46,693 --> 00:53:48,794
But then you
are but dead men
to your women.

1035
00:53:48,862 --> 00:53:50,295
I can assure you--

1036
00:53:50,363 --> 00:53:52,498
Oh, you can
assure me, sir.

1037
00:53:52,565 --> 00:53:55,501
Can you assure me
that come the morning,

1038
00:53:55,568 --> 00:53:59,271
You will not be
back at sea fighting
death itself?

1039
00:53:59,339 --> 00:54:01,473
Can you
assure me of that?

1040
00:54:02,909 --> 00:54:04,943
No, madam, i cannot.

1041
00:54:16,723 --> 00:54:19,458
There goes
the signal tower
again, sir.

1042
00:54:20,727 --> 00:54:23,962
I'd pay good money
to know what they're saying.

1043
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:25,731
Lookout: deck there!

1044
00:54:25,799 --> 00:54:27,066
Sails, sir!

1045
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:29,968
A whole crowd of them
on the starboard beam!

1046
00:54:30,036 --> 00:54:32,171
That's what
they're saying,
mr. Bush.

1047
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,506
Bush: the fleet.

1048
00:54:34,574 --> 00:54:35,974
Hornblower:
flagship signaling?

1049
00:54:36,042 --> 00:54:37,376
Mr. Hammond?

1050
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:38,377
Sir?

1051
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:40,379
Bush: the flagship
is signaling, sir?

1052
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:42,681
Hammond: yes, sir.
It's, um--

1053
00:54:42,749 --> 00:54:44,550
It's our number
followed by--

1054
00:54:44,617 --> 00:54:47,519
Followed by 2-1-3,

1055
00:54:47,587 --> 00:54:49,955
Which is--
Which is, um...

1056
00:54:51,191 --> 00:54:52,224
Mr. Orrock.

1057
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:55,260
That's captain report
aboard flagship, sir.

1058
00:54:58,498 --> 00:55:01,633
Learn your signals,
you little...

1059
00:55:01,701 --> 00:55:03,302
Gentleman.

1060
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,871
The book is useless
in a battle.

1061
00:55:16,249 --> 00:55:19,952
A fair and a fine dinner
awaits a man
aboard the talon, sir.

1062
00:55:21,454 --> 00:55:23,756
Fine food
and fine wine...

1063
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:28,127
But not that you're there
to enjoy yourself,
of course.

1064
00:55:28,194 --> 00:55:31,697
Planning a little surprise
for bony, no doubt.

1065
00:55:35,235 --> 00:55:36,902
And--
Wolfe...

1066
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:40,673
Why must you speak
when you have
nothing to say?

1067
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,408
Sorry, sir.

1068
00:55:42,475 --> 00:55:45,778
Hornblower:
the french fleet are at anchor
in the outer harbor,

1069
00:55:45,845 --> 00:55:48,514
And the entrance is protected
by the battery here,

1070
00:55:48,581 --> 00:55:51,150
And all our movements
are immediately reported

1071
00:55:51,217 --> 00:55:52,651
By the semaphore here.

1072
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:53,952
And thanks to
captain hornblower,

1073
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,955
We now know that
bonaparte has 50,000
men encamped here

1074
00:55:57,023 --> 00:55:59,024
Ready to embark at
a moment's notice.

1075
00:55:59,092 --> 00:56:01,493
And should the weather
turn foul and our fleet
be dispersed...

1076
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:04,329
The french will need
less than two days
to cross the channel.

1077
00:56:04,397 --> 00:56:06,598
So despite all
of hornblower's heroics,

1078
00:56:06,666 --> 00:56:10,369
Bonaparte will be issuing his
edicts from windsor castle
instead of versailles.

1079
00:56:10,437 --> 00:56:12,471
Not without
his fleet, he won't.

1080
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:14,573
Without ships,
he can't launch
an invasion,

1081
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:16,842
Which is why
i intend to make
a preemptive strike.

1082
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:20,079
Tomorrow i will
lead the squadron
into brest harbor

1083
00:56:20,146 --> 00:56:23,282
And destroy
the french fleet
at anchor.

1084
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:26,719
We will have to do something
about the semaphore
and the battery first, sir.

1085
00:56:26,786 --> 00:56:28,420
May i volunteer
the hotspur for--

1086
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:30,022
God save us
from young men

1087
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:31,423
Eager for glory.

1088
00:56:31,491 --> 00:56:34,193
Sir, i must insist
that you send a more
experienced officer.

1089
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,328
Insist,
captain hammond?

1090
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:38,964
No, sir.
It is i who insist

1091
00:56:39,032 --> 00:56:41,233
That you listen
to the plan.

1092
00:56:41,301 --> 00:56:43,869
Captain hornblower
will indeed attack
the semaphore

1093
00:56:43,937 --> 00:56:46,905
With a small party
and signal his success
with a blue rocket.

1094
00:56:46,973 --> 00:56:49,975
Might i suggest that
i launch the attack
today at dusk,

1095
00:56:50,043 --> 00:56:51,510
Making the most
of the evening mist?

1096
00:56:51,578 --> 00:56:54,213
Good.
Then as dawn breaks,
captain hammond,

1097
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,882
You will lead
a party of marines
and storm the battery

1098
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,885
And indicate
that it is taken
by two red rockets.

1099
00:56:59,953 --> 00:57:01,320
Will be an honor, sir.

1100
00:57:05,158 --> 00:57:06,725
Prodigious, doughty.

1101
00:57:06,793 --> 00:57:10,095
I trust this is more
to your liking, sir.

1102
00:57:10,163 --> 00:57:12,898
Yes. Well, i don't think
it's quite that simple,
doughty.

1103
00:57:12,966 --> 00:57:14,199
We have to mount
the attack first.

1104
00:57:14,267 --> 00:57:16,702
Come on,
captain hornblower.
Fire the first broadside.

1105
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:20,072
Let's see what lies
below in the dungeon, sir.

1106
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,040
Thank you.

1107
00:57:24,511 --> 00:57:26,979
Hammond: well, it's easy enough
to demolish a pie crust

1108
00:57:27,047 --> 00:57:30,249
Or burn a signal tower,
come to that.

1109
00:57:30,316 --> 00:57:33,986
You'll include my nephew
in your shore party, no doubt.

1110
00:57:34,054 --> 00:57:36,522
Well, your man is so
eager to serve with
captain hornblower?

1111
00:57:36,589 --> 00:57:39,158
Oh, he's destined
for great things, sir.

1112
00:57:39,225 --> 00:57:41,760
I trust you'll allow
him to temper his steel
in the fires of combat.

1113
00:57:41,828 --> 00:57:43,562
Oh, i shall
certainly consider
him, sir.

1114
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:46,365
Well, while you're at it,
you might consider taking
someone else.

1115
00:57:46,433 --> 00:57:49,835
Your raiding party
is gonna need
a good french speaker,

1116
00:57:49,903 --> 00:57:51,603
And i know
just the man.

1117
00:57:54,407 --> 00:57:56,875
Allo, monsieur bush.

1118
00:57:59,412 --> 00:58:02,114
Save your
linguistic skills
for the action, major.

1119
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:05,984
As you wish.

1120
00:58:11,524 --> 00:58:14,360
Mr. Matthews, you will
stay at the boat
with the marines

1121
00:58:14,427 --> 00:58:15,794
Once we've landed
to cover our retreat.

1122
00:58:15,862 --> 00:58:17,129
Aye, aye, sir.

1123
00:58:17,197 --> 00:58:19,598
Mr. Orrock,
you'll be in charge of
the demolition party.

1124
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:21,500
You better call
for volunteers

1125
00:58:21,568 --> 00:58:22,901
To carry
the explosives
and the fuses.

1126
00:58:22,969 --> 00:58:24,937
I'd be glad to, sir.

1127
00:58:25,005 --> 00:58:25,938
Good man.

1128
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:27,239
Better find somebody
to give you a hand.

1129
00:58:27,307 --> 00:58:29,742
Carry on,
mr. Orrock.
Aye, aye, sir.

1130
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:31,443
You heard
the captain, wolfe.

1131
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:33,479
Aye, aye, sir.
Now then...

1132
00:58:33,546 --> 00:58:35,514
Who wants to volunteer
for the nice little job

1133
00:58:35,582 --> 00:58:38,317
Of carrying
the explosives?

1134
00:58:41,955 --> 00:58:44,456
Hornblower:
mr. Hammond,
report to my cabin.

1135
00:58:47,994 --> 00:58:50,596
Come on, lads.
Explosives are nothing
to worry about

1136
00:58:50,663 --> 00:58:52,698
Unless you're careless.

1137
00:58:52,766 --> 00:58:55,100
Then your worries
are over.

1138
00:58:56,569 --> 00:58:57,770
You worried, styles?

1139
00:58:57,837 --> 00:58:59,471
Yes.
Good man.

1140
00:58:59,539 --> 00:59:02,007
Then you won't
be careless, will you?

1141
00:59:04,678 --> 00:59:07,980
Hornblower: you asked
to serve with me,
and you have.

1142
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:10,249
Should you now
request a transfer,

1143
00:59:10,316 --> 00:59:12,418
It will not reflect
on your character
or reputation.

1144
00:59:12,485 --> 00:59:13,719
I don't want
a transfer, sir.

1145
00:59:13,787 --> 00:59:16,021
I don't know
why you should
think otherwise.

1146
00:59:16,089 --> 00:59:18,123
My family has high
expectations of me, sir.

1147
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:21,694
I'm not asking
your family,
mr. Hammond.

1148
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:25,798
War is
a bloody business...

1149
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,435
And any man
in his right mind
would avoid it,

1150
00:59:29,502 --> 00:59:30,569
Given
half the chance.

1151
00:59:30,637 --> 00:59:33,706
With respect, sir,
no man would avoid it

1152
00:59:33,773 --> 00:59:35,874
Who cared
about his character
or reputation.

1153
00:59:35,942 --> 00:59:37,543
Please take me
with you, sir.

1154
01:00:00,533 --> 01:00:02,234
He wants a password.

1155
01:00:02,302 --> 01:00:04,436
Damn his eyes.

1156
01:00:04,504 --> 01:00:06,572
Tell him we've got
a lobster for his
officer or something.

1157
01:00:09,542 --> 01:00:10,809
Bien!

1158
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:36,235
Quietly there.

1159
01:00:36,302 --> 01:00:37,803
Matthews, you're in
charge here.
Aye, aye, sir.

1160
01:00:37,871 --> 01:00:39,271
Ready party,
follow me.

1161
01:01:34,394 --> 01:01:35,361
Bonsoir, monsieur.

1162
01:01:35,428 --> 01:01:36,395
Oui?

1163
01:01:51,845 --> 01:01:54,880
Right. Mr. Orrock, get
those charges placed.

1164
01:01:54,948 --> 01:01:56,348
Styles, stop hiding
behind that woman's skirt

1165
01:01:56,416 --> 01:01:57,349
And lend a hand, man.

1166
01:01:58,718 --> 01:01:59,785
Give me the fuse.

1167
01:01:59,853 --> 01:02:02,087
Well, i haven't got it, sir.
Wolfe's got it.

1168
01:02:02,155 --> 01:02:05,324
There's no sign
of wolfe, sir.

1169
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:10,896
Sir!

1170
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:14,833
Listen.

1171
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:18,137
Mr. Hammond.
Sir?

1172
01:02:18,204 --> 01:02:19,238
Run and tell
mr. Matthews

1173
01:02:19,305 --> 01:02:22,007
We'll be returning
directly. Go.

1174
01:02:26,446 --> 01:02:27,413
And get him out
of here.

1175
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,914
And everybody out.

1176
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,374
But how do we
ignite the charges

1177
01:02:55,442 --> 01:02:56,675
Without a fuse, sir?

1178
01:02:59,312 --> 01:03:01,046
Styles...

1179
01:03:01,114 --> 01:03:02,047
Aim the rocket
at the doorway.

1180
01:03:09,389 --> 01:03:10,989
Ready, sir.

1181
01:03:20,734 --> 01:03:22,201
That was
signal enough.

1182
01:03:22,268 --> 01:03:23,135
Come on.

1183
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:34,713
Present!

1184
01:03:37,283 --> 01:03:38,417
Hold your fire.

1185
01:03:40,653 --> 01:03:41,754
Where's
the captain, sir?

1186
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:43,122
They've been cut off.

1187
01:03:43,189 --> 01:03:45,124
Give me 6 men.
Tell them
to fix bayonets.

1188
01:03:45,191 --> 01:03:46,125
No. There's a company
of soldiers

1189
01:03:46,192 --> 01:03:47,226
Headed up there
and more on the way.

1190
01:03:47,293 --> 01:03:48,527
We must do
what we can, sir.

1191
01:03:48,595 --> 01:03:49,928
No. No. We must rejoin.

1192
01:03:49,996 --> 01:03:51,130
If we stay on this beach,
we'll be cut down
where we stand.

1193
01:03:51,197 --> 01:03:52,564
We can't leave without
the captain, sir.

1194
01:03:52,632 --> 01:03:54,133
For god's sakes, matthews,
the captain's been cut off.

1195
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,634
Get the men
into the boats.

1196
01:03:55,702 --> 01:03:56,735
Not without
an order, sir.

1197
01:03:56,803 --> 01:03:57,970
Those are his orders,
damn you!

1198
01:04:04,344 --> 01:04:06,345
We'll descend the cliff
to the beach.

1199
01:04:06,413 --> 01:04:07,680
I need two men here
to slow their advance.

1200
01:04:07,747 --> 01:04:09,148
I will stay.

1201
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,582
I'd rather have you
with me, major.

1202
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:12,618
Trust me.
I'm right behind you.

1203
01:04:12,686 --> 01:04:13,986
And i will stay,
too, sir.

1204
01:04:14,054 --> 01:04:17,823
Very well.
You two, give them
your pistols.

1205
01:04:17,891 --> 01:04:19,024
Don't leave it
too late.

1206
01:04:19,092 --> 01:04:21,560
We'll see you
at the bottom
of the cliff.

1207
01:04:23,496 --> 01:04:25,297
Follow me.

1208
01:04:33,273 --> 01:04:34,206
Aah!

1209
01:05:02,836 --> 01:05:04,770
Where are
the bloody marines?

1210
01:05:30,096 --> 01:05:32,197
All right, lads.
Well done.

1211
01:05:32,265 --> 01:05:33,499
And he ordered you
to withdraw the marines?

1212
01:05:33,566 --> 01:05:35,434
He saw the french
reinforcements

1213
01:05:35,502 --> 01:05:37,703
Advancing
on the signal
post, sir.

1214
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:39,171
He told me
to run ahead

1215
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:40,572
And evacuate
the jetty.

1216
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,174
Matthews?

1217
01:05:42,242 --> 01:05:43,242
We wanted to wait
for him, sir.

1218
01:05:43,309 --> 01:05:44,576
Thank you, mr. Hammond.

1219
01:05:44,644 --> 01:05:46,011
Return to your duties.

1220
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,212
Aye, aye, sir.

1221
01:05:49,082 --> 01:05:50,282
Dismissed, matthews.

1222
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:52,184
Sir.
Yes?

1223
01:05:55,355 --> 01:05:56,689
Nothing, sir.

1224
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:00,459
Orders, sir?

1225
01:06:00,527 --> 01:06:02,227
Signal to the flagship,

1226
01:06:02,295 --> 01:06:04,463
"Captain taken
in shore action.
Report to follow."

1227
01:06:04,531 --> 01:06:06,699
Aye, aye, sir.

1228
01:06:10,236 --> 01:06:13,605
Styles: ohh. Chained up
in a bloody store room.

1229
01:06:13,673 --> 01:06:16,008
Hornblower: there could be
worse prison cells, styles.

1230
01:06:25,452 --> 01:06:28,187
There's no way to break
out of this, captain.

1231
01:06:28,254 --> 01:06:29,855
So we'll be
prisoners for
the rest of the war.

1232
01:06:29,923 --> 01:06:31,990
Cheer up,
mr. Orrock.

1233
01:06:32,058 --> 01:06:33,659
If the admiral
prevails,

1234
01:06:33,727 --> 01:06:36,729
It will be
a very short war.

1235
01:06:36,796 --> 01:06:37,796
Le commandant.

1236
01:06:49,676 --> 01:06:51,777
Wolfe.

1237
01:06:56,116 --> 01:06:57,516
Eat, captain.

1238
01:06:57,584 --> 01:06:58,751
My cook is
a french chef,

1239
01:06:58,818 --> 01:07:00,919
Not an english
jailbird.

1240
01:07:00,987 --> 01:07:01,920
He can prepare
a meal

1241
01:07:01,988 --> 01:07:03,255
Without setting fire
to the galley.

1242
01:07:03,323 --> 01:07:04,656
You set that fire
on the ship.

1243
01:07:04,724 --> 01:07:07,226
I did all
i could as
a humble coxswain.

1244
01:07:07,293 --> 01:07:08,727
I do not eat
with traitors.

1245
01:07:08,795 --> 01:07:09,895
I'm no traitor.

1246
01:07:09,963 --> 01:07:12,131
You fight
for bonaparte.

1247
01:07:12,198 --> 01:07:15,334
I fight for ireland.

1248
01:07:15,402 --> 01:07:17,069
Bonaparte is merely
a means to an end.

1249
01:07:17,137 --> 01:07:18,704
He's a tyrant, man.

1250
01:07:18,772 --> 01:07:20,439
Why does an irishman
put his faith in him?

1251
01:07:20,507 --> 01:07:22,474
To save ireland
from worse tyrants.

1252
01:07:22,542 --> 01:07:25,244
You english have
been lording it over
us for long enough.

1253
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,246
You'll hang, man.

1254
01:07:27,313 --> 01:07:30,315
Bonaparte has used
irish rebels in the past,

1255
01:07:30,383 --> 01:07:31,950
And every time,
he has failed,

1256
01:07:32,018 --> 01:07:33,986
And every time,
they have died
on the gallows.

1257
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:37,022
I won't hang,
hornblower.

1258
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:38,524
But you will.

1259
01:07:38,591 --> 01:07:39,792
Sneaking ashore
dressed as
a fisherman

1260
01:07:39,859 --> 01:07:41,560
In search
of military secrets.

1261
01:07:41,628 --> 01:07:43,696
Now, i believe they
call that spying.

1262
01:07:43,763 --> 01:07:47,366
Then you are
as guilty as me.

1263
01:07:47,434 --> 01:07:48,534
You passed word
to the loire

1264
01:07:48,601 --> 01:07:49,568
About our rendezvous.

1265
01:07:49,636 --> 01:07:51,437
How could i?

1266
01:07:51,504 --> 01:07:53,205
I was on board
the hotspur
the whole time.

1267
01:07:53,273 --> 01:07:56,709
So your task
was to delay us

1268
01:07:56,776 --> 01:07:58,277
Long enough
for the loire
to intervene.

1269
01:07:58,345 --> 01:08:00,579
Well done, captain.

1270
01:08:00,647 --> 01:08:04,249
So there must be someone
more handily placed
within the fleet.

1271
01:08:04,317 --> 01:08:06,118
I bet you'd love
to know who he is.

1272
01:08:06,186 --> 01:08:08,354
If i'm to hang,
it'd cost you
nothing to tell me.

1273
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:11,957
It would be
a cruel fate indeed

1274
01:08:12,025 --> 01:08:12,958
To go
to the gallows

1275
01:08:13,026 --> 01:08:14,159
Tormented
by the fact

1276
01:08:14,227 --> 01:08:15,461
That you have
no idea who
betrayed you.

1277
01:08:17,597 --> 01:08:18,464
Guard.

1278
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:27,439
Enjoy your meal, wolfe.

1279
01:08:27,507 --> 01:08:29,742
Once admiral pellew
is done,

1280
01:08:29,809 --> 01:08:31,643
You won't be dining
on breton lobster.

1281
01:08:31,711 --> 01:08:33,512
When we're done,

1282
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:36,515
Breton lobster
will be dining
on admiral pellew.

1283
01:08:41,154 --> 01:08:42,921
Bush: sir, i could
sent a party ashore
to look for him.

1284
01:08:42,989 --> 01:08:44,690
No, mr. Bush.

1285
01:08:44,758 --> 01:08:46,892
Hornblower may have
destroyed their
communications,

1286
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,228
But captain hammond
still has to cripple
their defenses

1287
01:08:49,295 --> 01:08:50,295
By taking the battery,

1288
01:08:50,363 --> 01:08:52,364
And nothing must interfere
with his mission.

1289
01:08:52,432 --> 01:08:53,899
But, sir, it
need only be
a small party.

1290
01:08:53,967 --> 01:08:55,367
We could even create
a diversion.

1291
01:08:55,435 --> 01:08:57,403
Sir, i owe it
to him.

1292
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:58,570
We owe it to him.

1293
01:08:58,638 --> 01:08:59,872
Damn it, bush,
do you think
i don't know that?

1294
01:08:59,939 --> 01:09:01,707
Do you think i wouldn't--

1295
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:06,378
Hornblower may be lost,
but the war goes on.

1296
01:09:06,446 --> 01:09:07,713
You will take command
of the hotspur

1297
01:09:07,781 --> 01:09:08,981
And stand by ready
to support the action.

1298
01:09:09,049 --> 01:09:10,182
Aye, aye, sir.

1299
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,183
Come on, man.

1300
01:09:11,251 --> 01:09:12,184
We mustn't allow
our judgment

1301
01:09:12,252 --> 01:09:13,185
To be clouded
by sentiment

1302
01:09:13,253 --> 01:09:14,186
And wishful thinking.

1303
01:09:14,254 --> 01:09:15,988
Will that be
all, sir?

1304
01:09:20,627 --> 01:09:22,961
Sentiment
and wishful thinking.

1305
01:09:24,764 --> 01:09:25,998
No use at all.

1306
01:09:26,066 --> 01:09:29,468
I should have
spotted wolfe
for what he was.

1307
01:09:29,536 --> 01:09:31,470
He took me
for a fool.

1308
01:09:31,538 --> 01:09:35,341
The closer the enemy is,
the harder he is to see.

1309
01:09:35,408 --> 01:09:39,478
I carried
that traitor
aboard my ship,

1310
01:09:39,546 --> 01:09:41,013
And i had
you flogged
for his crime.

1311
01:09:41,081 --> 01:09:42,614
That's all right, sir.

1312
01:09:42,682 --> 01:09:43,816
It's wolfe who'll be sorry.

1313
01:09:43,883 --> 01:09:44,983
He'll have the skin
off his back

1314
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:46,218
If i ever get
the chance.

1315
01:09:46,286 --> 01:09:48,287
Hornblower:
and wolfe is not
our only concern.

1316
01:09:48,355 --> 01:09:50,422
Hammond's attempt
on the battery
will fail,

1317
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:53,125
And the fleet
will sail right
under its guns.

1318
01:09:53,193 --> 01:09:55,160
How do you know?

1319
01:09:55,228 --> 01:09:57,963
Because wolfe
has a contact
in the fleet,

1320
01:09:58,031 --> 01:09:59,365
A well-Placed
officer,

1321
01:09:59,432 --> 01:10:00,899
Who will have
betrayed
every detail

1322
01:10:00,967 --> 01:10:02,267
Of this attack
to the french.

1323
01:10:02,335 --> 01:10:04,870
And you still
suspect me.

1324
01:10:06,806 --> 01:10:09,775
So when will i
earn your trust,

1325
01:10:09,843 --> 01:10:11,877
When they hang me?

1326
01:10:51,918 --> 01:10:52,818
Sir.

1327
01:10:55,889 --> 01:10:58,057
Stay close by me.

1328
01:10:58,124 --> 01:10:59,658
All ready to go
ashore, mr. Bush.

1329
01:10:59,726 --> 01:11:00,693
Stand the men down,
matthews.

1330
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,194
The admiral has
other plans for us.

1331
01:11:02,262 --> 01:11:03,495
But, sir, we could
be there and back

1332
01:11:03,563 --> 01:11:04,997
Before he even knew
about it.

1333
01:11:05,065 --> 01:11:06,331
Are you suggesting
mutiny, man?

1334
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:09,034
No, sir.
I just wish--

1335
01:11:09,102 --> 01:11:11,236
So do i, matthews.

1336
01:11:11,304 --> 01:11:13,939
Mr. Prowse will
support the action.

1337
01:11:14,007 --> 01:11:15,507
Stand by to go in
with the squadron.

1338
01:11:15,575 --> 01:11:17,009
Aye, aye, sir.

1339
01:11:17,077 --> 01:11:19,278
Hammond: marines
will fix bayonets.

1340
01:11:19,346 --> 01:11:21,146
Fix bayonets.

1341
01:11:23,717 --> 01:11:26,618
Advance arms.

1342
01:11:32,726 --> 01:11:34,893
You will never move it.

1343
01:11:34,961 --> 01:11:37,096
You haven't served
in his majesty's navy.

1344
01:11:37,163 --> 01:11:40,132
You'll be surprised
what's possible.

1345
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,166
Orrock, styles.

1346
01:11:41,234 --> 01:11:42,301
Sir?
Sir.

1347
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:46,972
Time to weigh
anchor.

1348
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,208
Captain of marines,
carry on.

1349
01:11:49,275 --> 01:11:52,911
Captain of marines:
right wheel, quick, march.

1350
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,086
To the battery, men.

1351
01:12:01,154 --> 01:12:04,456
By the left...
quick march.

1352
01:12:06,659 --> 01:12:08,127
Left wheel.

1353
01:12:15,702 --> 01:12:16,835
All ready,
are we, sir?

1354
01:12:16,903 --> 01:12:19,638
Nowhere to run
to now.

1355
01:12:22,142 --> 01:12:23,742
A word if you please,
mr. Matthews.

1356
01:12:26,846 --> 01:12:28,380
I'll have you know,
matthews,

1357
01:12:28,448 --> 01:12:30,449
I don't much care
for your tone.

1358
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:32,251
Well, sir, i must say,
i don't give

1359
01:12:32,318 --> 01:12:33,719
A tinker's cuss
what you care for.

1360
01:12:33,787 --> 01:12:36,388
Captain hornblower
never ordered you
to clear that jetty.

1361
01:12:36,456 --> 01:12:37,423
You weren't there.

1362
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:39,425
He would never have
given up that easy,

1363
01:12:39,492 --> 01:12:40,759
Though you might.

1364
01:12:40,827 --> 01:12:42,027
You don't know
what happened.

1365
01:12:42,095 --> 01:12:43,962
I know he gave you
a chance to prove yourself.

1366
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:45,597
He's done that
for many a man,

1367
01:12:45,665 --> 01:12:47,966
For me, for styles,

1368
01:12:48,034 --> 01:12:51,270
And nobody's ever
let him down till now.

1369
01:12:53,239 --> 01:12:54,606
If that's all
you have to say, sir,

1370
01:12:54,674 --> 01:12:56,375
I've got work to do.

1371
01:13:02,549 --> 01:13:03,916
Stop there, captain hammond.

1372
01:13:25,005 --> 01:13:25,938
Halt!

1373
01:13:26,006 --> 01:13:27,539
Halt!

1374
01:13:42,389 --> 01:13:43,555
Surrender your sword

1375
01:13:43,623 --> 01:13:46,925
And tell your men
to lay down
their weapons,

1376
01:13:46,993 --> 01:13:49,461
Or would you see them
all slaughtered?

1377
01:14:13,987 --> 01:14:15,654
Are you ready, gentlemen?

1378
01:14:15,722 --> 01:14:17,356
2, 6.

1379
01:14:38,578 --> 01:14:40,045
Ugh!

1380
01:14:42,482 --> 01:14:43,782
Damn it!

1381
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:46,652
2, 6, heave!

1382
01:14:49,022 --> 01:14:50,055
Aah!
Unh!

1383
01:14:50,123 --> 01:14:52,324
Shh! Quiet now.
Quiet.

1384
01:14:58,798 --> 01:15:02,167
Right. A volunteer to be
first down the privy.

1385
01:15:02,235 --> 01:15:03,102
Styles?

1386
01:15:10,977 --> 01:15:14,680
I love fireworks.
Don't you, captain?

1387
01:15:14,748 --> 01:15:16,215
When the english
fleets sail
under the battery,

1388
01:15:16,282 --> 01:15:18,550
You'll see
plenty more.

1389
01:15:26,493 --> 01:15:28,127
Signal to squadron,

1390
01:15:28,194 --> 01:15:31,430
"All ships form
line astern
to flagship

1391
01:15:31,498 --> 01:15:32,698
With standards
abreast."

1392
01:15:49,382 --> 01:15:51,917
Handsomely there.
We don't want
to drop him.

1393
01:15:51,985 --> 01:15:52,918
Gonna smell like tea

1394
01:15:52,986 --> 01:15:55,454
And have a nice,
soft landing, sir.

1395
01:15:55,522 --> 01:15:56,889
Sir.

1396
01:16:04,497 --> 01:16:06,231
Ooh!

1397
01:16:11,004 --> 01:16:12,438
There's a tunnel, sir.

1398
01:16:12,505 --> 01:16:13,906
Where does it lead?

1399
01:16:13,973 --> 01:16:15,307
To the outside, sir.

1400
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:17,409
Where outside?
I don't know, sir.

1401
01:16:17,477 --> 01:16:18,577
Well, go and have
a look, man.

1402
01:16:30,824 --> 01:16:31,790
Right. Take my weight.

1403
01:16:36,329 --> 01:16:37,763
I don't much like
this, sir.

1404
01:16:37,831 --> 01:16:39,631
Relax, matthews.

1405
01:16:39,699 --> 01:16:42,001
Captain hammond
has seen to the guns.

1406
01:16:43,937 --> 01:16:47,272
Let's hope we can
count on your
uncle, sir.

1407
01:17:01,654 --> 01:17:04,256
Signal all ships to engage
the enemy, damn it!

1408
01:17:18,538 --> 01:17:19,805
Well?

1409
01:17:19,873 --> 01:17:22,675
We're on the outside
by the shore, sir.

1410
01:17:22,742 --> 01:17:26,378
Perfect. I'll get
the others.

1411
01:17:26,446 --> 01:17:27,680
Fire!

1412
01:17:27,747 --> 01:17:29,448
Fire
as you bear!

1413
01:17:38,324 --> 01:17:40,659
The hotspur, sir,
she'll be matchwood.

1414
01:17:54,374 --> 01:17:55,607
Aah!

1415
01:17:56,743 --> 01:17:58,210
Mr. Prowse,
alter course
to port.

1416
01:17:58,278 --> 01:17:59,712
If we do, we'll
run aground, sir.

1417
01:17:59,779 --> 01:18:01,213
If we don't,
we'll be smashed
to pieces.

1418
01:18:01,281 --> 01:18:02,748
Alter course.

1419
01:18:02,816 --> 01:18:03,782
We'll run in
under the guns

1420
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:04,883
And storm ashore
in the boats.

1421
01:18:04,951 --> 01:18:06,251
Aye, aye, sir.

1422
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:07,786
Hard aport!

1423
01:18:07,854 --> 01:18:08,787
Sir, i--

1424
01:18:08,855 --> 01:18:10,289
I'd like to come
with you, sir.

1425
01:18:15,128 --> 01:18:17,563
They'll never
do it.

1426
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:18,964
Not unless
we help them.

1427
01:18:19,032 --> 01:18:20,132
Mr. Orrock,
what do you
have there?

1428
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,967
A handy billy, sir.

1429
01:18:22,035 --> 01:18:23,035
Good man.
Come on.

1430
01:18:23,103 --> 01:18:24,536
You intend to attack
the battery

1431
01:18:24,604 --> 01:18:26,638
With nothing more than
a block and tackle?

1432
01:18:26,706 --> 01:18:28,240
Well, rather that
than stand idly by

1433
01:18:28,308 --> 01:18:29,308
While the fleet
is destroyed.

1434
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:30,843
Come on!

1435
01:18:40,687 --> 01:18:41,854
Mr. Orrock.

1436
01:18:44,724 --> 01:18:45,591
Mr. Orrock.

1437
01:18:50,163 --> 01:18:51,096
On my signal.

1438
01:18:51,164 --> 01:18:52,664
2, 6, heave!

1439
01:19:01,908 --> 01:19:04,076
Come on, men.
It's now or never!

1440
01:19:08,148 --> 01:19:12,117
On my signal!
2, 6, heave!

1441
01:20:19,686 --> 01:20:23,355
Hornblower: we'll have
to put those guns
out of action.

1442
01:20:23,423 --> 01:20:25,190
Swing the cannon
round this way.

1443
01:20:25,258 --> 01:20:26,625
Load it with
grapeshot in case.

1444
01:20:36,002 --> 01:20:37,369
That'll learn them.

1445
01:20:37,437 --> 01:20:40,539
Sir, we should
spike the guns.

1446
01:20:40,607 --> 01:20:42,875
We need a more
permanent arrangement,
major cotard.

1447
01:20:44,611 --> 01:20:45,544
To me!

1448
01:20:49,949 --> 01:20:51,583
Steady as she goes.

1449
01:20:58,324 --> 01:21:00,526
Pellew:
they've stopped, by god.

1450
01:21:00,593 --> 01:21:03,962
Signal all ships
to withdraw.

1451
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:05,731
Flagship signaling,
sir.

1452
01:21:05,799 --> 01:21:08,367
All ships then
withdraw, sir.

1453
01:21:08,435 --> 01:21:09,401
Are you sure?

1454
01:21:09,469 --> 01:21:10,669
Yes, sir.

1455
01:21:10,737 --> 01:21:12,571
Better check it.
Look it up
in the book.

1456
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:14,673
Aye, aye, sir,

1457
01:21:14,741 --> 01:21:16,308
But i am sure, sir.

1458
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:17,576
He is right, sir.

1459
01:21:17,644 --> 01:21:18,577
Yes. I know
he's right,
but by the time

1460
01:21:18,645 --> 01:21:20,746
He's looked it up
in the book--
Ahh.

1461
01:21:34,861 --> 01:21:37,196
A la batterie!
A la batterie!

1462
01:21:45,438 --> 01:21:46,538
Oui?

1463
01:21:59,386 --> 01:22:01,387
I do not always
miss, captain.

1464
01:22:01,454 --> 01:22:02,955
I'm glad
to see it, major.

1465
01:22:10,463 --> 01:22:12,064
Get back!
Clear the battery!

1466
01:22:34,087 --> 01:22:35,054
You go on, sir.
I'll do--

1467
01:22:35,121 --> 01:22:36,321
Oh. Shut up, styles!

1468
01:22:36,389 --> 01:22:38,257
Wolfe: hornblower!

1469
01:22:38,324 --> 01:22:40,025
Give me your musket
and run!

1470
01:22:40,093 --> 01:22:41,393
Hornblower!

1471
01:22:55,642 --> 01:22:57,109
My god!

1472
01:22:59,045 --> 01:23:00,713
Belay the last order.

1473
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:03,415
Signal the squadron,
"engage the enemy."

1474
01:23:05,485 --> 01:23:07,019
You all right, sir?

1475
01:23:07,087 --> 01:23:08,220
I'm a bit singed,
styles.

1476
01:23:08,288 --> 01:23:10,422
Oh, no, sir.
You're done
to a turn.

1477
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:11,790
Trust me.
I'm a cook.

1478
01:23:13,526 --> 01:23:14,993
Merde!

1479
01:23:15,061 --> 01:23:16,929
Evacuent! Evacuent!

1480
01:23:27,974 --> 01:23:29,808
Take my arm, sir.

1481
01:23:44,391 --> 01:23:46,558
Cotard: thought
you must be dead,
captain.

1482
01:23:46,626 --> 01:23:47,526
Not yet, major.

1483
01:23:47,594 --> 01:23:48,660
Styles: quickly, sir.

1484
01:23:48,728 --> 01:23:50,262
Good luck don't
last forever.

1485
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:51,397
Aah!

1486
01:23:51,464 --> 01:23:52,464
Damn!

1487
01:23:52,532 --> 01:23:53,999
Aah!

1488
01:24:12,585 --> 01:24:14,053
I should have
stretched your neck

1489
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,054
When i had the chance.

1490
01:24:15,121 --> 01:24:17,856
I shall surrender

1491
01:24:17,924 --> 01:24:19,958
If you vouch my men
shall not be harmed.

1492
01:24:20,026 --> 01:24:22,394
No bargains,
hornblower.

1493
01:24:24,831 --> 01:24:26,565
Captain hammond.

1494
01:24:31,271 --> 01:24:33,739
So much for his
dazzling insight.

1495
01:24:36,009 --> 01:24:38,944
You thought
your enemy within
would be a frenchman.

1496
01:24:46,553 --> 01:24:48,954
I thought you, sir,

1497
01:24:49,022 --> 01:24:50,689
Had sworn an oath
to serve your king.

1498
01:24:50,757 --> 01:24:52,458
He's no king
of mine, sir.

1499
01:24:52,525 --> 01:24:55,027
I serve ireland
and her people.

1500
01:24:55,095 --> 01:24:57,363
Yet all these years,
you've played

1501
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:59,264
The loyal british officer.

1502
01:24:59,332 --> 01:25:02,368
What better way
to serve my country?

1503
01:25:02,435 --> 01:25:05,771
I knew my opportunity
would come,

1504
01:25:05,839 --> 01:25:07,806
And you, hornblower,

1505
01:25:07,874 --> 01:25:11,010
Very nearly
ruined it.

1506
01:25:11,077 --> 01:25:12,011
Commandant wolfe.

1507
01:25:12,078 --> 01:25:14,646
Sir!

1508
01:25:14,714 --> 01:25:18,450
These men
were escaping
from custody.

1509
01:25:18,518 --> 01:25:19,385
Deal with them.

1510
01:25:26,793 --> 01:25:28,260
Orrock here
is irish.

1511
01:25:28,328 --> 01:25:30,562
For god's sakes, man,
you gonna shoot him, too?

1512
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:31,930
All these others--

1513
01:25:31,998 --> 01:25:35,000
Thank you, sir,
but i'll stay
with you.

1514
01:25:35,068 --> 01:25:37,002
That goes
for me, too, sir.

1515
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:39,772
Aye!
Aye!

1516
01:25:39,839 --> 01:25:45,210
And i will stay
with my comrades, also.

1517
01:25:45,278 --> 01:25:47,613
You are, all of you,
damned sheep,

1518
01:25:47,681 --> 01:25:51,283
And like damned sheep,
you will be slaughtered.

1519
01:26:06,466 --> 01:26:09,101
Bush:
hotspurs, with me!

1520
01:26:12,772 --> 01:26:14,673
Charge!

1521
01:26:47,707 --> 01:26:48,674
Ohh!

1522
01:27:02,355 --> 01:27:05,491
Well, you bastard,
i owe you one!

1523
01:27:05,558 --> 01:27:06,859
Aah! Aah!

1524
01:27:08,728 --> 01:27:09,895
Don't want to
kill you, young lad.

1525
01:27:09,963 --> 01:27:11,230
Then fight me, sir!

1526
01:27:28,181 --> 01:27:29,381
Aah!

1527
01:27:39,526 --> 01:27:41,393
For france, sir.

1528
01:27:51,304 --> 01:27:53,706
Good man, jack.

1529
01:28:01,214 --> 01:28:02,581
Come on,
you damn bugger.

1530
01:28:02,649 --> 01:28:03,615
You'll get
yourself killed!

1531
01:28:06,486 --> 01:28:08,120
You devil!

1532
01:28:12,559 --> 01:28:13,926
Enough, hornblower,
enough.

1533
01:28:24,504 --> 01:28:26,438
Man: see to the wounded.

1534
01:28:31,077 --> 01:28:32,511
We've done our bit.

1535
01:28:32,579 --> 01:28:34,646
Now it's up
to admiral pellew
and the fleet.

1536
01:28:47,794 --> 01:28:51,096
Oh, god.

1537
01:28:51,164 --> 01:28:52,031
No.

1538
01:28:57,437 --> 01:28:59,338
Oh, jack, lad.

1539
01:29:03,843 --> 01:29:05,477
Oh, my god.
What have i done?

1540
01:29:05,545 --> 01:29:06,879
Why--

1541
01:29:09,149 --> 01:29:10,416
Why was i
so frightened?

1542
01:29:10,483 --> 01:29:15,054
I wanted you
to be taken
with hornblower.

1543
01:29:15,121 --> 01:29:16,388
I wanted you
off the hotspur.

1544
01:29:16,456 --> 01:29:19,191
Uncle? Uncle,
is that you?

1545
01:29:21,795 --> 01:29:23,629
I didn't disgrace
the family name,
did i?

1546
01:29:31,071 --> 01:29:33,405
They would have been
proud of you, jack.

1547
01:30:14,647 --> 01:30:17,316
Stop, sir.

1548
01:30:17,384 --> 01:30:20,953
Stop where
you stand, sir.

1549
01:30:21,021 --> 01:30:22,588
Captain hammond!

1550
01:30:22,655 --> 01:30:24,089
Don't make me
shoot you, sir!

1551
01:30:25,925 --> 01:30:28,193
I will not
hesitate, sir!

1552
01:31:00,527 --> 01:31:04,129
You say in your report
that captain hammond
blamed himself

1553
01:31:04,197 --> 01:31:06,799
For the failure
of his assault
on the battery.

1554
01:31:06,866 --> 01:31:08,267
Yes, sir.

1555
01:31:08,335 --> 01:31:10,002
And despite
your entreaties,

1556
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:11,570
He insisted on dying
with honor.

1557
01:31:11,638 --> 01:31:12,571
Yes, sir.

1558
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:13,839
You do know
i've spoken

1559
01:31:13,907 --> 01:31:15,708
With major cotard?

1560
01:31:15,775 --> 01:31:17,409
I imagined
you would have, sir.

1561
01:31:17,477 --> 01:31:18,510
There was a time,
hornblower,

1562
01:31:18,578 --> 01:31:20,112
When you would have
needed some convincing

1563
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:22,614
About the merits
of any economy
with the truth.

1564
01:31:24,184 --> 01:31:25,884
Yes, sir,

1565
01:31:25,952 --> 01:31:29,321
But these are
uncertain times
in ireland,

1566
01:31:29,389 --> 01:31:32,391
And more than
a quarter of the men
in the fleet are irish.

1567
01:31:32,459 --> 01:31:35,160
Hmm, and the truth
about hammond

1568
01:31:35,228 --> 01:31:36,295
Could spread
disaffection.

1569
01:31:36,363 --> 01:31:37,663
Yes, sir,

1570
01:31:37,731 --> 01:31:39,765
Which would
only serve
bonaparte's cause.

1571
01:31:39,833 --> 01:31:41,800
Bonaparte has nothing
to offer ireland

1572
01:31:41,868 --> 01:31:44,003
But misery
and bloodshed.

1573
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:47,973
Ha! That's why england
has a right to demand
irish loyalty.

1574
01:31:48,041 --> 01:31:50,175
Yes, sir, although--
Huh?

1575
01:31:52,045 --> 01:31:55,381
It is perhaps
better to earn
loyalty

1576
01:31:55,448 --> 01:31:56,715
Than to demand it.

1577
01:31:58,051 --> 01:32:00,619
When i was a child,
i spake as a child,

1578
01:32:00,687 --> 01:32:04,356
I understood as a child,
i thought as a child;

1579
01:32:04,424 --> 01:32:10,863
But when i became a man,
i put away childish things.

1580
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:12,698
Sir?

1581
01:32:12,766 --> 01:32:16,435
Well, you know,
hornblower...

1582
01:32:18,405 --> 01:32:23,375
It's very hard
for a father to see
his children grow up.

1583
01:32:25,812 --> 01:32:27,680
I'm not sure i
understand you, sir.

1584
01:32:30,083 --> 01:32:31,450
I dare say, you will.

1585
01:32:37,223 --> 01:32:38,323
Mr. Hornblower, sir.

1586
01:32:38,391 --> 01:32:41,493
I saw the hotspur,
sir, in the harbor.

1587
01:32:41,561 --> 01:32:43,829
I hoped it might
signal your return.

1588
01:32:43,897 --> 01:32:45,264
It must be good for you
to be home again.

1589
01:32:45,331 --> 01:32:48,334
It is.
Thank you, sir,

1590
01:32:48,401 --> 01:32:50,969
And also good
to see you.

1591
01:32:51,037 --> 01:32:51,937
Come in.

1592
01:32:56,776 --> 01:32:58,644
You, uh, have enough
for the rent?

1593
01:32:58,712 --> 01:33:04,550
Oh, um, i hope
to get a position
as a governess.

1594
01:33:04,617 --> 01:33:06,285
I can't be a burden
on your charity.

1595
01:33:06,353 --> 01:33:08,787
You're no burden,
i assure you.

1596
01:33:08,855 --> 01:33:11,223
No, mr. Hornblower,
i can't.

1597
01:33:11,291 --> 01:33:13,425
Maria, you are
in greater need
than i.

1598
01:33:13,493 --> 01:33:16,428
I have no
living relatives,

1599
01:33:16,496 --> 01:33:18,330
And you're
the closest thing
i have to--

1600
01:33:20,266 --> 01:33:21,200
To a family.

1601
01:33:21,267 --> 01:33:22,701
Yes, but i'm not
your family.

1602
01:33:22,769 --> 01:33:24,470
Maria.

1603
01:33:24,537 --> 01:33:25,904
There's a word
for a woman

1604
01:33:25,972 --> 01:33:27,439
Who accepts money
from a man.

1605
01:33:27,507 --> 01:33:29,174
Yes, and that word
is friend.

1606
01:33:29,242 --> 01:33:31,143
I treasure
your friendship,

1607
01:33:31,211 --> 01:33:35,047
But i cannot keep
both your money
and my reputation.

1608
01:33:38,218 --> 01:33:41,787
My apologies.
Of course.

1609
01:33:41,855 --> 01:33:43,622
I should have--

1610
01:33:43,690 --> 01:33:45,924
No. I didn't mean
for you to leave, sir.

1611
01:33:45,992 --> 01:33:48,127
I can see that
i have imposed
upon you, maria.

1612
01:33:48,194 --> 01:33:49,862
I've been
thoughtless.

1613
01:33:49,929 --> 01:33:52,598
No. That's not
what i meant, sir.

1614
01:33:53,867 --> 01:33:56,568
You're not dead
then, sir?

1615
01:33:56,636 --> 01:33:59,271
It would
appear not, madam.

1616
01:34:05,412 --> 01:34:07,446
She wept when you
were gone, sir,

1617
01:34:07,514 --> 01:34:09,882
My maria.

1618
01:34:09,949 --> 01:34:11,684
I'd hate to think
how much she'd weep

1619
01:34:11,751 --> 01:34:13,018
Had you not
returned.

1620
01:34:14,888 --> 01:34:15,854
She wept?

1621
01:34:15,922 --> 01:34:18,957
She wept
for you, sir,

1622
01:34:19,025 --> 01:34:22,294
And why
she bothered,
i don't know.

1623
01:34:39,312 --> 01:34:42,314
Maria, please don't cry.

1624
01:34:55,261 --> 01:34:58,530
If i were your family,
would you let me help you?

1625
01:35:01,701 --> 01:35:04,136
I don't know
what you mean, sir.

1626
01:35:06,406 --> 01:35:08,574
What i mean is, uh...

1627
01:35:11,544 --> 01:35:14,480
If i were to ask,
maria, would you--

1628
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:18,317
Would i?

1629
01:35:27,193 --> 01:35:28,127
Would you marry me?

1630
01:35:28,194 --> 01:35:29,495
Say yes.

1631
01:35:32,799 --> 01:35:34,266
Oh, horatio!

1632
