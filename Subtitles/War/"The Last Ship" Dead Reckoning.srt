CIC, Bridge.
What are we dealing with here?

00:00:09,205 --> 00:00:10,805
Sir, EW reports
it's an old version

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,640
of a Kirov-class
guided missile cruiser.

00:00:14,543 --> 00:00:16,644
I thought those were mothballed
in the '90s.

7
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:19,013
They're old and ugly,
but they're still dangerous.

With whom do I have the pleasure
of speaking?

9
00:00:21,283 --> 00:00:24,085

16
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:34,863
Aye, Captain.

17
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:39,901

18
00:00:39,935 --> 00:00:42,137
<i>that you are in United States</i>

Withdraw seaward or you will be
subject to defensive action.

21

Commander Chandler, I have
pursued you across the globe,

those demands be?

28
00:01:04,593 --> 00:01:06,060
Well, let's not be coy.

29

Sorry, Admiral, but I don't know
what you're talking about.

<i>And the thing is,</i>
<i>I don't take orders from you.</i>

35

And now I'm gonna
ask you one more time.

36
00:01:27,982 --> 00:01:29,884
Move your ship.

37
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:35,152

What about the Russians?
Were they close?

I mean, nobody was making
any real progress.

54
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:45,055
And I hate to say it, but they're
probably all dead anyway. Why?

55
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,324
If somebody had the primordial
strain of the virus,

56
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:50,260
the stuff you found in the ice,
could they make a vaccine?

57
00:02:52,363 --> 00:02:53,997
I suppose, if they had
the right equipment

58
00:02:54,032 --> 00:02:55,232
and someone qualified
to run it.

59
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:56,466

I hate freakin' mines.

109
00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:21,171
I told Moscow it was suicide

110
00:06:21,205 --> 00:06:23,206
and that we must remain at sea

111
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,575
if we are to survive
this plague,

112
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:26,910

"All ships must
return to home ports."

114
00:06:29,814 --> 00:06:32,749
And so I took matters
into my own hands.

115
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:35,618
You are looking

So the uniform we wear
matters no more.

00:06:44,762 --> 00:06:46,663
Well, it matters to me.

119
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,531
Whether mine is one of a dozen

120
00:06:48,566 --> 00:06:50,266
or the last ship to survive,

121
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:52,268
we're all sailors
of the United States Navy.

122
00:06:52,303 --> 00:06:53,570
Of course you are.

123
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:58,675
Still, that we are here
is cause to rejoice, no?

124
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,710
You got a funny way
of celebrating, Admiral--

How many people do you think
you killed-- 5, 10 million?

127
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:08,918
France was already dead.

128
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:11,387
That missile
was meant to stop you,

00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:13,957

and sneaking home

130
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:16,002
with the vaccine
in your pocket.

131
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:19,835
We have no interest in keeping the
vaccine to ourselves. It's for the world.

132
00:07:20,254 --> 00:07:22,222
Do you know what was going on
in the world

133
00:07:22,256 --> 00:07:24,524
while you were playing
your war games in the Arctic?

134
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:27,561

in its path.

Bodies piled up sky-high.

137
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:35,936
The fear spread even quicker
than the virus itself--

138
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,204
turned country against country,

139
00:07:38,272 --> 00:07:39,973

against their own people.

00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:45,645
60 million Chinese were murdered
in three days

142
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,250
like they were culling
so many piglets.

143
00:07:50,284 --> 00:07:52,185
The world...

144
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:54,688
is not worth saving.

145
00:07:54,755 --> 00:07:59,492
So, what? You want to keep
the vaccine for yourself?

146
00:07:59,527 --> 00:08:01,394
What I want
is of no concern to you.

147
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:03,530
Well, I don't have it.

148
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:05,065
Not yet, at least.

149
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:06,933
And you won't,

150
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:09,102
because you are missing
an ingredient only I possess.

151
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,006
Now, you will give me
what you have--

152
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,642
the primordial sample,

153
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:19,245
your research,
and Dr. Scott.

154
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,105
Or you die in Cuba.

155
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:26,160
You won't fire on my ship
as long as we have what you want.

156
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,810
And this little game of chicken
you're playing right now

157
00:08:29,845 --> 00:08:32,380
will only cause millions
more to die.

158
00:08:32,414 --> 00:08:34,882
So why don't I lead
with my best offer?

159
00:08:42,257 --> 00:08:45,259
A sample of
the primordial virus.

160
00:08:50,132 --> 00:08:52,600
With my compliments.

161
00:08:57,706 --> 00:09:00,341
I'm sorry.
That will not do, not at all.

our scientist.

164
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,652
Don't be foolish, Captain.

165
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:13,521
You cannot win.

166
00:09:15,891 --> 00:09:18,392
I'll go.
I'll go with them.

167
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:20,561
- I can do what's needed. I'm capable...
- No!

168
00:09:20,595 --> 00:09:26,334
Not him. Dr. Rachel Scott.
She is the one I want.

169
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:28,302
Well, that's not gonna happen.

170
00:09:28,337 --> 00:09:30,575
I can outlast you
and your band of cowboys.

171
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:34,479
My ship has enough nuclear fuel
to patrol this harbor

172
00:09:34,513 --> 00:09:36,214
for the next 25 years.

173
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,184
Then you get nothing, Admiral.

174
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:41,720
And while you're sitting
out there,

175

00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:55,342
It's you they want.

349
00:19:55,376 --> 00:19:56,777
Just you.

350
00:19:58,246 --> 00:20:01,381
I'm not going anywhere.

351
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,750
You're gonna have
to kill me, too.

352
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:08,188
Jeter:
Put your weapons down.

353
00:20:08,256 --> 00:20:09,223
Stay back!

354
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,028
Rachel:
Give me the vial, Quincy.

355
00:20:15,063 --> 00:20:18,732
Rachel, they're not
gonna hurt you.

356
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:20,968
They promised me.

357
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:22,169
So, please...

358
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:25,005
Please come with me.

359
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:28,041
You're not gonna kill
all these people.

360
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:32,779
It's not who you are.

361
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:40,187
Give me the vial?

362
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:55,469
Please.

363
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:08,448
[Screaming]

364
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,202
He must have been talking
to the Russians all along.

365
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,171
That's how they were able
to follow us.

366
00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:23,807
I mean, he was my partner
for almost 10 years.

367
00:21:23,841 --> 00:21:25,875
I'm at a complete loss!

368
00:21:25,943 --> 00:21:27,944
What were his connections
to the Russians?

369
00:21:27,978 --> 00:21:29,212
I don't know.

370
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,880
I mean, he studied there
years ago.

371
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,982
He has friends, he has
colleagues-- We both do.

372
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,619
[Sighs]
It doesn't make sense.

373
00:21:36,687 --> 00:21:38,955
I told you, I hadn't met him,
not until yesterday!

374
00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:42,058
So, what were you two,
like, Facebook friends?

375
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,961
I need to see the Captain.
My family is in grave danger.

376
00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:46,496
Yeah, we'll get to that.

377
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:47,230
First you're gonna tell me
about your relationship

378
00:21:47,298 --> 00:21:49,733
- with the Admiral.
- There is no relationship.

379
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,568
There never was a relationship!

380
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,937
Please, my daughter is
a prisoner on his ship!

381
00:21:53,971 --> 00:21:57,006
You almost killed
my entire crew,

382
00:21:57,041 --> 00:22:00,043
so I recommend
you start talking.

383
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,112
It wasn't supposed to happen
like this.

384
00:22:07,051 --> 00:22:10,086
During the hysteria
of the outbreak,

385
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:12,555
governments were pressuring
their biologists

386
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,724
to deliberately withhold
vital information,

387
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:17,227
research that could possibly
contribute to a vaccine.

388
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,095
I disagreed.

389
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,999
And I began sharing information
with another scientist,

390
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:24,300
Sergei Yumanov.

391
00:22:24,335 --> 00:22:25,802
Sharing?
You mean leaking.

392
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,237
You don't understand!

393
00:22:27,271 --> 00:22:28,972
While governments bickered
amongst themselves,

394
00:22:29,006 --> 00:22:31,074
the virus was winning!
I couldn't let that happen!

395
00:22:31,108 --> 00:22:35,078
Ruskov suggested he had someone
or something on his ship

396
00:22:35,112 --> 00:22:37,280
to help him make a vaccine.
Is that your friend?

397
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,249
Sergei's dead.

398
00:22:39,283 --> 00:22:43,119
I'd been communicating with him
on the sat phone.

399
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:47,791
Then two weeks before the
Russians attacked us on the ice,

400
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,125
I called Sergei,

401
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,861
and it was Ruskov
on the end of the line.

402
00:22:51,896 --> 00:22:54,631
He'd murdered Sergei

403
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,800
[Voice breaking]
and taken my family--

404
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,268
my daughter and my wife.

405
00:22:58,302 --> 00:23:00,837
It was a Brit that kept us
in the harbor

406
00:23:00,871 --> 00:23:03,706
by pretending to be CO
of that UK destroyer.

407
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:04,908
Quite a performance
by your wife.

408
00:23:04,975 --> 00:23:06,810
Kelly had nothing to do
with this.

409
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,379
Ruskov is using her
to get to me

410
00:23:09,413 --> 00:23:10,880
and, more importantly, Rachel.

411
00:23:10,915 --> 00:23:12,882
Listen.

412
00:23:12,917 --> 00:23:16,853
I did a stupid, stupid thing.
Do what you want with me,

413
00:23:16,887 --> 00:23:19,856
but please don't make my family
pay for my mistakes.

414
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:23,259
Ruskov will kill them
if I don't do as he says.

415
00:23:23,294 --> 00:23:24,994
What exactly
was your plan tonight?

416
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:29,644
I was supposed to take Rachel
and the samples

417
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,085
to the other side of the beach.

418
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,601
There's a boat I can use
to get us to the<i> Vyerni.</i>

419
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:57,827
Who am I impersonating
at this godforsaken hour,

420
00:23:57,862 --> 00:23:59,662
the Queen of England?

421
00:23:59,697 --> 00:24:01,865
No, your work is done,
duschenka.

422
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:06,269
Now it's up to your husband,
and we will see.

423
00:24:06,303 --> 00:24:10,106
See... what?

424
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,743
If he loves his family
as much as you say.

425
00:24:20,718 --> 00:24:24,721
I must admit, I have mixed
feelings about his success.

426
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:28,892
I've come to enjoy
our time together.

427
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,065
Chandler: The Russians
are expecting Quincy

428
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,268
to show up with Dr. Scott
on the civilian vessel

429
00:24:38,302 --> 00:24:40,270
some time tonight
while there's no moon.

430
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:42,138
The meeting will go off
as planned

431
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:43,973
with a few important
differences.

432
00:24:44,008 --> 00:24:45,742
Sir, unless we completely
cripple the<i> Vyerni,</i>

433
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,110
he'll still have
retaliatory capability.

434
00:24:47,177 --> 00:24:50,013
By then, we'll be safely
out of the harbor.

435
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,416
Smith and Berchem
didn't die in vain.

436
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,152
They showed us we can make our
escape through the old canal.

437
00:24:56,186 --> 00:24:58,988
Sir, forgive me, but it's one
thing to send a RHIB through.

438
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:01,291
This is a destroyer.
The water's not deep enough.

439
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:02,759
It's not possible.

440
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,227
Exactly why the Russians
won't expect it.

441
00:25:04,261 --> 00:25:06,763
At high tide, we'll have
two, three feet clearance.

442
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:11,301
That canal is so narrow,

443
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:12,702
we won't have any margin
for error.

444
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,771
And then there's
the coral growth.

445
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,039
It'll rip our hull apart.

446
00:25:16,073 --> 00:25:17,473
So we blast ourselves a hole.

447
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:19,075
But, sir, the minute
we move the ship,

448
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,343
Ruskov will see us
on his radar.

449
00:25:20,377 --> 00:25:21,744
He's staring right at us.

450
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:23,046
Chandler:
He's not looking at us.

451
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,114
He's looking at a red dot
on a radar screen.

452
00:25:25,182 --> 00:25:27,450
On that screen, we could be
any ship in this port.

453
00:25:30,187 --> 00:25:32,188
Let's prepare the Bridge Team.

454
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:39,128
Chandler:
Lieutenant Foster.

455
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:41,197
We need a female
for this mission.

456
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:44,233
You grew up on a farm.
Can you still handle a rifle?

457
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:48,137
Qualified as expert marksman
last year.

458
00:25:48,205 --> 00:25:50,807
I can knock the nipples
off a chicken

459
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,442
from a thousand yards, sir.

460
00:25:52,476 --> 00:25:55,411
Okay, you're on Alpha Team
with Rowler.

461
00:25:55,446 --> 00:25:56,512
Yes, sir.

462
00:26:00,918 --> 00:26:01,985
Sir?

463
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,286
I don't feel comfortable

464
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,822
having Lieutenant Foster
on this mission.

465
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:08,191
She's never seen action
like this before.

466
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:09,826
Objection noted, Lieutenant.

467
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,333
- She's going.
- Then I'm riding Alpha.

468
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,200
Sir, I've...

469
00:26:17,267 --> 00:26:21,204
I've already lost two men while
standing on the sidelines.

470
00:26:21,238 --> 00:26:24,474
Search Team couldn't even
recover their bodies.

471
00:26:24,508 --> 00:26:26,476
I need to be out there
this time.

472
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:31,214
Thank you, sir.

473
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,372
Slattery: High tide in exactly
2 hours and 48 minutes.

474
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:50,709
We're gonna take this ship
through the eye of the needle.

475
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:52,344
To avoid Russian radar,

476
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:54,746
we're gonna do it
at EMCON Alpha 1--

477
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:58,050
no sonar, no radar.

478
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,052
But we're up to the challenge.

479
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:04,623
Yes, sir!

480
00:27:04,691 --> 00:27:07,259
- Let's get the low-vis watch
team on the bow. - Sir.

481
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:13,031
Sir, without radar,
we're gonna be awfully close

482
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,500
to that coral
in order to hit the mark.

483
00:27:15,535 --> 00:27:17,502
We won't get a second chance.

484
00:27:17,537 --> 00:27:19,738
We'll just have to get it right
the first time.

485
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:23,375
Aye, sir.

486
00:27:26,964 --> 00:27:29,925
_

487
00:27:30,045 --> 00:27:38,458
_

488
00:27:38,547 --> 00:27:43,764
_

489
00:27:43,865 --> 00:27:49,933
_

490
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:51,703
[All shout in Russian]

491
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:07,419
Just keep your head down!

492
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:10,255
Keeping my head down's kinda
gonna defeat the purpose,

493
00:28:10,323 --> 00:28:11,256
don't you think?

494
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:21,366
We're good to go.

495
00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:22,634
Next radio click comes

496
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:24,202
when they're 500 yards
from impact zone.

497
00:28:24,237 --> 00:28:25,771
Chandler: Single up.

498
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:28,307
When the Master Chief's back
on board, take in all lines.

499
00:28:28,341 --> 00:28:29,808
Everyone watch the clock.

500
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:31,576
We're timing this
down to the second.

501
00:28:31,611 --> 00:28:33,445
Together: Aye, sir.

502
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:37,816
Last time I navigated
by dead reckoning

503
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,618
was the sailing team
at the academy.

504
00:28:39,652 --> 00:28:42,187
I'm more nervous about being
blown out of the water.

505
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:45,791
On the bright side,
with our radar turned off,

506
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:47,693
we won't see it coming.

507
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,711
All right, Miller.
Find a spot right here.

508
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,379
All right.

509
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,317
I don't mean to sound dim, sir,

510
00:29:12,352 --> 00:29:14,286
but how's a roll
of aluminum foil

511
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,555
supposed to look like
a 500-foot destroyer?

512
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,557
It's all about reflections,
my man.

513
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:20,325
The<i> James</i> has low reflectivity,

514
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,227
which makes us hard
to pick up on radar.

515
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,528
In fact, to the Russians,

516
00:29:23,563 --> 00:29:26,431
we look just about the same
as a few square feet

517
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:29,701
of tin foil,
pointed in the right direction.

518
00:29:31,571 --> 00:29:32,604
[Chuckles]

519
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:36,842
Master Chief, you about ready?

520
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:38,643
Yes, sir.
On your order.

521
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:45,917
