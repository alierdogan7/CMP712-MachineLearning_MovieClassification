1
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,188
(theme music playing)

2
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,301
(crickets chirping)

3
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,244
Tee, will you see whoever it is calling
so late in the evening?

4
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,622
Yes, ma'am.

5
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,418
(car door closes)

6
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,509
It's a man
in a uniform, ma'am.

7
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,261
(cup clinks)

8
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,100
(knocks on door)

9
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,395
(door opens)

10
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,191
(door closes)

11
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,946
(Tee chuckles)

12
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,783
(gasps)
Sidney Phillips.

13
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,160
- Oh! Father, Sid's here.
- (Sid chuckles)

14
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,996
- I hope I didn't startle you, Mrs. Sledge.
- Oh, not at all.

15
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,791
Now who the hell is this
standing in my hallway?

16
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,710
- It's Sidney.
- Dr. Sledge.

17
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,420
There's more pie
on the counter.

18
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,172
Thank you, Rose.

19
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,763
I want you to speak frankly
about my Eugene.

20
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,308
- How is he, Sid?
- Now don't put the boy on the spot.

21
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,270
Mrs. Sledge,

22
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,730
Eugene's with a lot
of good marines.

23
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,774
The 1st is
the best there is.

24
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,569
They're great guys, too.
They look after each other.

25
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,281
Besides that, well,
he's a mortar man,

26
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,617
the same as me.
Us stovepipe boys,

27
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,744
we're always a little
behind the hot stuff,

28
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,289
which is a good place to be,
let me tell you.

29
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,917
Now I can't say this
about every marine I know,

30
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,963
but I'm not worried
about Eugene.

31
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,799
See, Father?

32
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,427
That's not
so hard to hear,

33
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,304
is it?

34
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,520
(bombs exploding)

35
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,106
Man:
Second platoon corpsman, get up here!

36
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,275
(plane engines roaring)

37
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,362
(men speaking)

38
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,830
(lighter clicks)

39
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,004
Snafu:
What the hell you doing?

40
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,633
Break this shit down.
Get ready to move.

41
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,277
What do you got?
Any movement?

42
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,946
It's all quiet.

43
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,990
Any word on Hoosier?

44
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,411
Well, we got hit
pretty hard on the beach.

45
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,454
We're still sorting out
the casualties.

46
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,749
- Let's go.
- No word on ours, though.

47
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,756
(lighter clicks)

48
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,925
God damn it, I just want
some fucking water.

49
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,772
(canteen clinks)

50
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,941
(distant gunfire)

51
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,993
(distant yelling)

52
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,204
Man:
There's a gook squad off the the right!

53
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,830
Man #2:
Yeah, they're coming from...

54
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,416
Hey. Hey!

55
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,962
Somebody found water.
I swear to Christ.

56
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,673
- Water.
- Somebody found water.

57
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,764
- Halle-fucking-lujah.
- There's plenty, boys.

58
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,975
- All right. Yeah.
- (water sloshing)

59
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,936
Man #3:
Pass my helmet.

60
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,609
Oh, Jesus! Man!

61
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,237
It's poisoned.

62
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,447
Jap fuckers
poisoned it.

63
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,449
(sighs)

64
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,993
(water sloshing)

65
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:01,122
Man #4: Listen up, Weapons!
CO's got our orders!

66
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,626
Haldane:
All right, here it is.

67
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,922
The entire division's moving
across the airfield at 0900.

68
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,800
First and second
platoon will lead,

69
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,219
followed by Weapons
and third platoon.

70
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,766
The only way to stop this Jap artillery
is to get into those hills,

71
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,228
and the only way into those hills is
across this airfield.

72
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,148
When we move,
do not stop until we get across.

73
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,776
- You got it?
- All: Aye, Skipper.

74
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,778
Any questions?

75
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,072
We need water,
Captain.

76
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,241
I'm working
on it, Corporal.

77
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,995
Get your gear ready
and stand by.

78
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,789
Haney: Get back to your positions.
Pack it up!

79
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,792
Man: Let's go, second squad!
Let's get back on line!

80
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,546
Man #2:
Let's go, rockets!

81
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,924
Pack 'em up!
Move it!

82
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,021
We have to cross that?

83
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,691
Quit whining.

84
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,027
It'll all be over
by the time you cross.

85
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,778
Japs hate mortars
and bazookas

86
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,947
as much
as riflemen, Leyden.

87
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,533
How many Japs
do you think are up there?

88
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:25,040
- Anybody got any asswipe?
- No asswipe, no chow,

89
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,208
no water.
So don't even think about it.

90
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,544
A nice cold sip
of water?

91
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,047
A little splash
on your head?

92
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:35,133
Put it right out
of your mind.

93
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,305
I've got a little water.

94
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,309
(men chatting)

95
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,788
(explosion)

96
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,399
(man yells)
We gotta go!

97
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,943
Stand by!
Look alive!

98
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,571
Thank you.

99
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,366
Man: Let's go!
Get that gear squared away!

100
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,160
You've been promoted.

101
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,621
You're gonna give him
the mortar sight?

102
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,916
It's the least
I can do for the water.

103
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,589
Man:
Second squad, on me!

104
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,552
Get off your ass.

105
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,514
Get under that gear.
We're moving shortly.

106
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,728
Man #2:
Stay alert! Stand by!

107
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,278
(distant gunfire)

108
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,121
Hey, the 5th's dry too.

109
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,665
Maybe the Japs have
some over there.

110
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,338
How could they send
us up here without any fucking water?

111
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,800
Lucky?

112
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,969
(multiple explosions)

113
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,983
Get your gear together!
Stand by to move out!

114
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,444
(plane engines roaring)

115
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,711
(distant explosions)

116
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,021
Thank God for the navy.

117
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,407
First and second platoon,
move out!

118
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,326
Man: Let's move!
Let's move! Let's move!

119
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,328
(men shouting)

120
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,705
Man:
Let's move!

121
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,457
Haldane: Come on, first squad!
Stay on me!

122
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,168
- On me, second squad!
- Man #2: Hurry it up, people!

123
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,797
(guns cocking)

124
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,093
(men yell)

125
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,681
Left platoon,
move out!

126
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,766
Man #2: Go go go!
Move it! Let's go!

127
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,852
Always first.

128
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,229
- Man: Okay, let's cross the airfield!
- Right behind you, Bill.

129
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,691
- Man #2: Do not stop!
- Man #3: Move! Stay low!

130
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,860
(guns cocking)

131
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,238
Weapons, let's go!

132
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,074
Man: First squad,
push dead ahead!

133
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,952
- See you on the other side!
- Haldane: Let's go!

134
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,745
Go! Hurry up!
Let's go!

135
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,206
- Man #3: Move it!
- (plane engines roaring)

136
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,376
(guns cocking)

137
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,840
(bombs exploding)

138
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,386
(men shouting)

139
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,388
(grunts)

140
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,849
(men screaming)

141
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,522
(machine guns firing)

142
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,912
- (man screams)
- Get him out of here!

143
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,714
Reassemble
at the fallen base!

144
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,883
Come on, Sledge! Move!

145
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,938
Let's go.

146
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,330
Listen up!
We're crossing the airfield!

147
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,624
Stand by to move out!

148
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,502
Man: Get ready to cross!
Pass the word!

149
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:08,091
We're up!
How company!

150
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,927
On the left,
on the right, move out!

151
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,471
(plane engines roaring)

152
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,431
- See you on the other side!
- Let's go, marines!

153
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,935
- Let's go!
- Man: Go go go!

154
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,730
(bombs exploding)

155
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,775
- (men screaming)
- (machine guns firing)

156
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,360
Man:
Move it!

157
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,921
My knee!

158
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,350
Man #2:
Corpsman, help me!

159
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,571
Haldane:
Stand by to move!

160
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,865
Seibel, move out!
Let's go!

161
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,242
Sonny! Joe!

162
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,124
- Sniper attack!
- (rifles firing)

163
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,380
Let's go!
Move out! Go go!

164
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,885
Haldane: Move out!
Let's go! Let's go!

165
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,928
(gunfire continues)

166
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,825
(screams)

167
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,920
Don't stop moving!
Let's go!

168
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,935
You're all right!
Get up!

169
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,905
(men shouting)

170
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,582
You've got to get up!
Come on! You're all right!

171
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,710
- Man: Move it! Move it!
- Come on!

172
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,212
Hurts like hell!

173
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,767
(slurring)
Are you receiving?

174
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,769
Halfway across
the runway, sir.

175
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,604
We're taking heavy fire.

176
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,149
- Runner.
- We need an air strike.

177
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,526
We need...
we need an air strike...

178
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,319
(gurgles)
...to subdue Jap artillery

179
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,196
from the hill.
(gagging)

180
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,906
Are you receiving?

181
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,712
- Gotta get some fire on that bastard.
- We're gonna get you some help.

182
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,757
Are you receiving?
Are you receiving?

183
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,760
- I don't think we can send.
- Need a goddamn radio that works.

184
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,596
Fix it. Do you hear me?
Get it done.

185
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,973
- Yes, sir.
- (machine gun fires)

186
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,267
Leckie.

187
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,769
White Castle, this is How-4.
Do you read?

188
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,105
- Gotta go back.
- What about Conley?

189
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,024
Get us a radio
and a corpsman up here.

190
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,526
- I'll stay with Conley.
- (gunfire continues)

191
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,364
Okay.

192
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,742
Man: White Castle,
this is How-4. Do you read?

193
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,953
Hey, I'm coming back.
I'm coming back. Do you hear me?

194
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,790
I'm coming back.
I'm coming back.

195
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,295
Come on,
stay with me.

196
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,733
(man screaming)

197
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,206
Corpsman!
Hey, corpsman!

198
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,103
- Working time is at X-ray-5.
- Corpsman!

199
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,729
White Castle, White Castle,
do you read?

200
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,731
I need a corpsman
and a radio!

201
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,733
A radio?
You're better off

202
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,610
with two tin cans
and a fucking string.

203
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,320
Man:
...plus 100. Over.

204
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,657
- Get me in contact!
- Man: White Castle...

205
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,826
(machine gun firing)

206
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,458
This is Ack Ack.
Are you receiving? Drover-King-6...

207
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,044
(yells)

208
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,006
We need an air strike
on it. Over.

209
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,882
(clanks)

210
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,635
We've gotta get the hell out of here!
Let's go! Let's go!

211
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,637
Man:
Let's go! Let's go!

212
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,849
- Come on! Let's go!
- (gunfire continues)

213
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,695
Man #2:
Get him on his feet! Keep moving!

214
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,755
- You're okay!
- Come on!

215
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,757
- Come on!
- Let's go!

216
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,860
Oswalt!

217
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,783
(plane engines roaring)

218
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,672
(machine guns firing)

219
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,720
Man:
Let's go! Let's go!

220
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,847
(men shouting)

221
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,861
Corpsman!
Hey, corpsman!

222
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,030
(jeep approaches)

223
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,658
Corpsman!

224
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,660
(plane engine roars)

225
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,471
Mortars, bomb center sector
and adjust!

226
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,223
Direct fire...

227
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,268
HE on the building
on your right front!

228
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,812
- (men shouting)
- (machine gun firing)

229
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:08,070
Leyden, get that gun
on the right!

230
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,911
- Hanging!
- Fire!

231
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,916
- Hanging!
- Fire two!

232
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,920
(yelling
in Japanese)

233
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,842
Get that one
on the left, Jay!

234
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,223
Direct fire, 100.

235
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,392
Base charge.

236
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,901
- Hanging.
- Fire!

237
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,117
- 100'! Hit 'em again!
- Four!

238
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,994
- Hanging.
- Fire!

239
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,166
Let's go, K company!
Move out!

240
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,084
(men shouting)

241
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,838
Ah!

242
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,889
Spread out!
Keep moving!

243
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,670
- (groaning)
- Man: Up.

244
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,883
Stop.

245
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,724
Easy.

246
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,893
- (bomb explodes)
- Squad leaders,

247
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,104
find your people,
check 'em out.

248
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:08,649
You JASCO people,
get set up and wired in.

249
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,485
I need an ammo count.

250
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,904
What do you got?
What do you need?

251
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,657
We'll have OPs
going up before dark.

252
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:20,369
- Here you go, guys.
- Haney: Standby to standby.

253
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:24,206
- That's all we've got. Pass it around.
- (tank clanking)

254
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,008
- Is this ltem company?
- No, K-3-5.

255
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,636
I've got to get back
to Baker-1-7.

256
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,972
Do you have any idea
where they are?

257
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,726
No, I don't. I need you
to take our wounded back to the beach.

258
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,728
No can do.
We're moving out.

259
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,896
(tank engine revs)

260
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,296
Hold here till
we load our wounded,

261
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,256
then you can move your ass
wherever you want.

262
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,634
Yes, sir.

263
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,721
(engine stops)

264
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,890
Get the wounded aboard!

265
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,728
Let's get 'em
onboard!

266
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,897
(people chatting)

267
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,903
We're fine below!
Lower away!

268
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,953
- Out of the way, sir.
- Where do you want this one?

269
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,039
Man:
Right over here.

270
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,259
- Man #2: Clean this dressing.
- Woman: Doctor, his BP is falling.

271
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,720
Doctor:
Clamp the bleeder... right there.

272
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,472
Woman:
I've got a diminished blood pressure.

273
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,891
Sponge.

274
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:15,359
He's gone. Get him below
and prep that abdominal.

275
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,325
(coughing)

276
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,456
(crying)

277
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,347
(man speaking)

278
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,897
Daniels:56,

279
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,359
57,

280
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,737
58...

281
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,573
Man #2: Set him down here.
Get a tourniquet on that.

282
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:07,327
...60, 61...

283
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,748
Dextrose. Take one now,
save one for the morning.

284
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,876
...62, 63,

285
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,795
64,

286
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,883
65,

287
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,887
- 66...
- Whatcha doing, Daniels?

288
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,725
- Water.
- Counting Japs.

289
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,729
One, two, three...

290
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,732
- What's the report, Hillbilly?
- 81 from battalion.

291
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,817
60s are all here
and registered.

292
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:42,738
Gunny, I need another man
at second platoon LP.

293
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,324
Roger that.

294
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:49,369
Hey, Daniels.
Second platoon LP. Let's go.

295
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,079
Daniels:
I can count Japs from here.

296
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,373
Hey, Daniels,
did you hear me?

297
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,750
- I said...
- Gunny. Gunny.

298
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,753
Find someone else for him.
I need Daniels here.

299
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,717
Aye, Skipper.

300
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,720
Haldane: Doc, Daniels is gonna come
help you count bandages,

301
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,306
- maybe get a little shut-eye.
- Yes, sir.

302
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,434
Come on, Private.
Let someone else take over.

303
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,436
There's so many
to count.

304
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,563
I know, Private.
I know.

305
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,235
All right, Daniels.

306
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,411
Just as easily been me
counting Japs I can't see.

307
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,165
But it's not you.

308
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,588
Sir, coming across
the airfield today...

309
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,095
I've never been more scared
in my entire life.

310
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,016
We're all afraid.

311
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,727
All of us.

312
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:01,692
A man who isn't scared out here is
either a liar or dead.

313
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,372
History is full of wars

314
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,124
fought for 100 reasons.

315
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:21,378
But this war, our war,

316
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,547
I want to believe...

317
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,134
I have to believe

318
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,803
that every step
across that airfield

319
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:33,432
every man that's wounded,
every man I lose...

320
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,604
that it's all worthwhile
because our cause is just.

321
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,277
Of course, if a just cause came
with some hot food and cold water,

322
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,571
that'd be okay too.

323
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,873
Rest up, boys.

324
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,837
- Thought you might need that.
- Thank you, sir.

325
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,641
Ack Ack got me my battlefield
commission on the Canal.

326
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:21,563
Seems like
1,000 years ago now.

327
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,277
You handled yourself
well today, Sledge.

328
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,072
You'll be all right.

329
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,908
Just remember
your training.

330
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,035
Yes, sir.

331
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,384
...order
for the 3rd Battalion

332
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:53,178
to make a company-sized
frontal assault.

333
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,555
G2 thinks the bulk
of the Japanese defenses

334
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,058
are dug into the ridges
that run up the spine of the valley.

335
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,852
Until we take the high ground,
they'll keep plastering us.

336
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,813
Haldane:
We're moving into the hills!

337
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,982
Haney:
Let's move, people!

338
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,736
- Pork chops.
- Pork chops? That's my meat.

339
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:10,904
Courtesy
of LST-661.

340
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,699
- About time.
- Thank you.

341
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,867
- Let's go. Let's go.
- (men chatting)

342
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,709
(barks)

343
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,801
(distant explosions)

344
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,516
Saw you reading
last night.

345
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,728
My Bible.

346
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,896
Writing too.

347
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,735
Ain't supposed
to write shit down, you know.

348
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:53,697
It gives the Japs valuable intel
if they find it.

349
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,908
I guess I won't show it
to them then.

350
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,420
Got a smoke?

351
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,382
(lighter clinks)

352
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,815
Thanks, Sledgehammer.

353
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,234
Sledgehammer.

354
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,071
I like that.

355
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,281
- Jesus Christ.
- Snafu: Don't worry.

356
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,241
We've got a nickname
for you too, Bill Leyden.

357
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,286
We call you
ball-peen hammer...

358
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,539
a little hammer
for a little man.

359
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,709
All right, Snafu.

360
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,961
Shit 'n' ass...

361
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,922
fuck up.

362
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:56,259
- (chuckles)
- Little joke from the little man.

363
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,099
(distant explosions)

364
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,518
- Gunny, get someone from mortars.
- Aye, Skipper.

365
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,103
Burgie, get me an FO.

366
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,688
- Sledge.
- Haldane: You too, Leyden. Let's go.

367
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,732
- First squad, follow me!
- Hold 'em here, Sergeant.

368
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,734
- Set up a security perimeter.
- Aye, sir.

369
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,277
Set up
a security perimeter.

370
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,696
Machine guns move out
to the left and right flank.

371
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,698
Riflemen,
faced outwards.

372
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,700
Man:
Second squad, 36, let's go.

373
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,869
Man #2:
91 over on the right!

374
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,253
(distant gunfire)

375
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:58,155
Looks like two heavy
bamboo machine guns,

376
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,532
probably more.

377
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,284
I need to get
a better look.

378
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:06,371
- Sledge, Leyden.
- No no, I'm gonna scout it.

379
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,832
- You sure?
- Yeah.

380
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,877
Get your top ready.

381
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,379
(machine guns firing)

382
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,967
Skipper, pull back!

383
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,886
Stay on those guns!

384
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,066
It's a fortress up there.

385
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,487
We've gotta move!
Pull back!

386
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,656
(mortars exploding)

387
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,368
- Pull back!
- Let's go! Let's go!

388
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,578
Pull back!

389
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,840
- Man: Skipper coming in!
- Man #2: Hold your fire!

390
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,595
- Radio, get me battalion.
- Yes, sir.

391
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,681
White Castle, this is Harper Field.
Do you read?

392
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,100
Do you read?

393
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,978
Haldane: Master White, Ack Ack.
We've done the recon.

394
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,105
Objective is
heavily fortified.

395
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,732
Limited approaches
and plunging fire all the way.

396
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,695
We can't take this objective without
unacceptable casualties.

397
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,697
Do you copy?

398
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,615
Fuck.

399
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,787
I've got to go back
to battalion,

400
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,248
get these orders changed.

401
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,333
Good luck.

402
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,837
If I don't come back,
the company's yours.

403
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,556
(flare hissing)

404
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,354
Do you think
he'll come back?

405
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,858
You disobey orders,
you get court-martialed.

406
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,902
You guys,
check your weapons.

407
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,572
Keep a round chambered.

408
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,990
Done.

409
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,451
Can you believe this
bullshit about the dog?

410
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:53,246
Some dog's supposed
to smell a Jap before me?

411
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,248
I don't think so.

412
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:59,461
I appreciate the thought, but ain't no dog
gonna make me sleep safe at night.

413
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,671
I've got a dog.

414
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,298
His name's Deacon.

415
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,718
You keep fucking
that stovepipe.

416
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:10,055
If the Nips come through here at high port
with fixed bayonets,

417
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,349
you nail 'em with flare
and HE as fast as you can.

418
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,143
- You think you can do that?
- We've got it, Gunny.

419
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:18,146
I was asking
Sledgehammer.

420
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,981
Yes, Gunny Haney.

421
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,527
Woof.

422
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,865
(laughing)

423
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,744
What the fuck was that?

424
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:36,289
- (men laughing)
- Hey, stovetop boys... woof!

425
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,888
(wind blowing)

426
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,607
(man whimpering)

427
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,699
What's that?

428
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,743
Sledge: Sounds like some guy
having a nightmare.

429
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,703
Snafu: He'd better shut up before every
Nip on this island knows we're here.

430
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,706
Hillbilly:
Quiet that man down.

431
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,418
God damn it,
shut up.

432
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,504
- (yelling) No! No!
- Hillbilly: Quiet down!

433
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,715
Hold him down!
Stick him with morphine.

434
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,884
Shut that fucker up.

435
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,722
- Stick him with morphine.
- (yelling continues)

436
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,351
- (gun fires)
- Jesus Christ, who the hell is that?

437
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,478
(flare hissing)

438
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,693
Hillbilly:
Hold him down. Calm down.

439
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,696
Help me, please!
Help me!

440
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,699
That guy is gonna get us all killed
if he don't shut up.

441
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,076
Hold him down.
Hold him.

442
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,623
Hit him with something.

443
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,714
- Help me!
- (thuds)

444
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,883
(men panting)

445
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,563
All right.

446
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,524
Get back to...

447
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,944
get back to your holes.

448
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,881
I guess better him
than all of us.

449
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,676
Sledgehammer's right.

450
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,889
It had to be done.

451
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:08,316
- What you got back there?
- What do you want?

452
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,610
I'll take
a cup ofjoe.

453
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:16,658
Runner: Hey, Peaches,
are you gonna waste those?

454
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:25,583
- You made it.
- I could say the same about you.

455
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,130
I tried to get you
a corpsman.

456
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:37,303
- I tried to get back to you.
- I know.

457
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,472
Lucky, I know.

458
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,902
(grunts)

459
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,663
You, uh...

460
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,375
you heard any word
about Hoosier?

461
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:15,758
Chuckler's still on that goddamn
piece-of-shit island.

462
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,472
Left a piece of whatever
hit me in my arm.

463
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,683
I guess I'll never have
to buy another drink

464
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,644
- in Buffalo ever again.
- (chuckles)

465
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:31,232
I'm gonna grab some coffee.
Do you want some?

466
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,736
Can you take me
topside?

467
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,198
I need some air.

468
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,701
- (rain pattering)
- Haldane: We've got our orders changed.

469
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,703
Regiment wants us hunting Japs
up the east road.

470
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:46,289
Don't blame yourself.
You did the right thing.

471
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,876
- Good to have you back, sir.
- Thanks.

472
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,879
K company,
move out!

473
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,857
(plane engines roaring)

474
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,111
Whoever is up there
is getting pounded.

475
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,490
- You should start to feel better.
- (engine thrumming)

476
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,868
Feel that.
They're starting the engines.

477
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,832
Yeah.

478
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,877
Hey.

479
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,302
Let's go home,
cobber.

480
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,797
(distant explosions)

481
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,103
(theme music playing)
