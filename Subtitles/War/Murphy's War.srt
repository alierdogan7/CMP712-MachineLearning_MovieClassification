1
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,300
Get those boats free!

2
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,785
Get back!

3
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,940
Let him go, let him go!

4
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,980
Clear the way!

5
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,060
Take it easy. No rushing.

6
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,580
Come on, Smith, in you get.

7
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,420
I'm bloody hurt!
I can't see!

8
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,580
Jesus Christ, help me!

9
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,020
Help!

10
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,220
My eyes, my eyes!

11
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,220
Jesus.

12
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,180
Shh!

13
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,340
Now, you're all right.

14
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,460
Lie down, please.

15
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,780
Now, lie down.
You're all right.

16
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,980
Lie down.

17
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,060
That's right.

18
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,540
Yes.

19
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,660
That's right.

20
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,700
Oh, Mother of Christ,
I itch!

21
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,900
Midges. Very nasty.

22
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,620
Heart's sound enough.

23
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,660
What are you doing?

24
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,340
Who are you?

25
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,820
I'm Dr. Hayden.

26
00:06:24,855 --> 00:06:27,260
A lady doctor?

27
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,980
Now, face down, please.

28
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,220
We'll see about those bites
of yours.

29
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,460
Lady, I'm stark bullocks naked!

30
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,820
We're all God's children,
Mr. Murphy,

31
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,540
and I've seen plenty
of backsides before.

32
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,260
You won't be beautiful
for awhile.

33
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,140
But around here,
it won't make any difference.

34
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,420
Where the... am I?

35
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,420
Somewhere where we try

36
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,100
to avoid that kind of language,
Mr. Murphy.

37
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,300
You're at Quiliapo Quaker
Medical Missionary.

38
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,660
There's nothing wrong
with me... language.

39
00:07:03,695 --> 00:07:05,545
Other side, please.

40
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,740
Do you not have
a gentleman doctor?

41
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,980
Other side, please.

42
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,140
Yes, sir.

43
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,220
Lucky only the midges bit you.

44
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,780
Now, the piranha fish
should've picked you

45
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,380
clean down to the bones.

46
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,100
What are they doing?

47
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,140
Come on.

48
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,300
Try and relax.

49
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,420
Relax?

50
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,140
How can I relax with that bunch
gawking at me?

51
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,820
Well, that "bunch,"
as you call them,

52
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,420
have never seen a naked
white man.

53
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,620
Oh.

54
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,420
Well, they've had their thrill
for the day.

55
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,900
Would you tell them to...

56
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,940
leave immediately?

57
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,540
All things considered,
Mr. Murphy,

58
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,500
I find your modesty
rather touching.

59
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,700
I'm sure we're going
to get on splendidly.

60
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,100
Spendidly, spendidly...

61
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,220
Right. There you are.

62
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,740
How do you feel now?

63
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,500
Marvelous.

64
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,420
Now, you take this.

65
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,620
Holy...

66
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,580
You're a very lucky man.

67
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,580
You find anyone else?

68
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,700
We're still looking.

69
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,425
Poor suffering bastards.

70
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,700
I've been trying
to radio a message

71
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,180
about you to Trinidad.

72
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,380
No luck yet, I'm afraid.

73
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,860
Oh, that's very unfortunate,
but I'm in no rush.

74
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,660
Out there,
they're killing people.

75
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,260
I'll try again tomorrow.

76
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,660
What was the name
of your ship?

77
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,260
The Mount Kyle.

78
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,020
Mount Kyle.

79
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,580
If you must radio something,
tell them about that submarine.

80
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,620
And what submarine was that?

81
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,860
The ugly bum bastard
that sunk us.

82
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,060
Hey, came up your river.

83
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,900
No. No, it didn't.

84
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,980
I saw it.

85
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,580
I think someone would have
mentioned it.

86
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,020
I'm telling you,
it went straight past me.

87
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,140
Yes, well,
you've been in a coma.

88
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,140
It was probably an alligator.

89
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,020
Well, this alligator had guns
sticking from its nostrils.

90
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,420
Don't you worry about it.

91
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,745
Try and get some sleep.

92
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,580
Whatever it was, it's gone now.

93
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,860
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

94
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,100
She's...

95
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,420
She's a charmer.

96
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,540
She's beautiful.

97
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,540
Oh, holy, she's lovely.

98
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,380
Good for you.

99
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,060
Water.

100
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,260
Oh, so... it's you.

101
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,740
So, you-you've recovered!

102
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,460
Are you the fellow that...?

103
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Yes, I found you!

104
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,860
God bless you.

105
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,100
I salute your deeds.

106
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,420
Extraordinary.

107
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,540
Cigarette?

108
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,300
No, thank you.

109
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,140
From my position on the river,
I can look to see.

110
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,860
Such a fight!

111
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,460
The flames!

112
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,020
Visible for miles!

113
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,140
Give a touch?

114
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,700
Uh... oh, yeah.

115
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,980
And out of them,
but one man emerges.

116
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,180
One man.

117
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,820
Oh!

118
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,980
Truly heroic.

119
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,860
Nothing heroic, me old, son.

120
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,980
It came natural.

121
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,740
I was saving me own skin.

122
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,020
The name's Murphy.

123
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,260
Louis Brezon.

124
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,380
How are you?

125
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,460
Fine.

126
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,380
Been fishing?

127
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:11,460
Oh, no.

128
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,900
No. I like to cook,
I like to eat.

129
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,300
I don't like to fish.

130
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,740
Oh.

131
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,500
What do you do here
when you're not, uh,

132
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,460
cooking or eating?

133
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,500
You play cards?

134
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,580
Holy Mother of...

135
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,340
Would you ever take me
for a trip?

136
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,580
Of course.

137
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,980
It's a pleasure.

138
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,980
And then, we can talk about
the British naval tradition, eh?

139
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,300
Naval tradition?

140
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,300
Yeah.

141
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,580
Getting drunk
and catching the clap.

142
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,220
For which I have
the greatest regard.

143
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,020
It seems that this war
will be over soon.

144
00:11:55,055 --> 00:11:57,420
Today on the wireless,

145
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,500
they said Hitler
has been killed.

146
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,540
Don't believe it.

147
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,740
He'll have lived
through the winter.

148
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,100
How I envy you.

149
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,740
The hard glory of combat,
the exhilaration.

150
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,740
Man is only truly alive
when he confronts death.

151
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,500
He can also be truly dead.

152
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,420
Such a bitter thing.

153
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,620
A man like me, to be left
in the backwash of the war.

154
00:12:32,655 --> 00:12:36,300
I begged them,
"Let me face the Germans. "

155
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:37,460
Oh, no, no.

156
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,740
They insisted my place was here,
in charge of the equipment.

157
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:46,100
I must admit,
it is very valuable equipment.

158
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,020
This?

159
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,940
No, no, no.

160
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,180
No, the wharf where I live.

161
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,340
I work for the oil company.

162
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,620
I've been left in sole charge.

163
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,060
There are Indians on the river,

164
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,060
who would strip off every bolt
if they were not watched.

165
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,985
I know the feeling.

166
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,420
If it isn't nailed down,
it's mine.

167
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,660
How deep is this?

168
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,020
Deep.

169
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,140
I personally supervise
the dredging

170
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,380
from the mouth of the river

171
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,420
to the headquarters
of my company.

172
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,900
Seagoing ships sailed.

173
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,820
Then a submarine
could get up here.

174
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,260
Submarine?

175
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,540
A German submarine?

176
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,385
Why would one want to?

177
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,660
I'm only asking if it could.

178
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:21,300
We have picked up a survivor
from the Mount Kyle.

179
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:27,740
He believes the German submarine
that sank the Mount Kyle

180
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,180
came up the River Orinoco.

181
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,700
He asked me to tell you this.

182
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,340
Half a tick!
I think they found somebody!

183
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,060
Well, now, Lieutenant.

184
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,340
From your ship?

185
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,660
Yeah.

186
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,460
Oh, no.

187
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,020
Murphy.

188
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,180
In the flesh.

189
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,460
Anyone else?

190
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,740
No.

191
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,740
Oh, God. It had to be you.

192
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,780
Did the U-boat give you a lift?

193
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,860
Don't be talking.

194
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,220
Any half decent officer
would have sunk

195
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,620
the bastard submarine.

196
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,780
Mr. Murphy, would you please
stop talking to him.

197
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,740
I beg your pardon.

198
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,060
This lady's a doctor.

199
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,660
She's a charmer.
You'll love her.

200
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,780
Murphy.

201
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,300
Any complaints?

202
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,940
I managed to beach the plane.

203
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,620
But first find her,
bring her in.

204
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,140
In? The plane? Why?

205
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,460
Patch her.

206
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,060
Now that's an order, Murphy.

207
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,300
Oh, well now.

208
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,140
Just bring her in, please.

209
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,180
Immediately, sir.

210
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,100
Uh, any notion where she is?

211
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,300
No, damn you. No.

212
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,660
Stop getting him excited.

213
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,900
Excited? Him?

214
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,625
Stupid boring English pilot.

215
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,660
Mr. Murphy,
will you please shut up?

216
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,900
And when you're in the sun,

217
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,220
would you try to remember
to wear something on your head?

218
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,180
Well, look after him.

219
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,620
He's not a bad old skin
considering...

220
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,900
You get out of the way,
and I will get on with my job.

221
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:14,260
It's no job for a woman.

222
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,060
Louis, you speak the lingo?

223
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,420
Aye, I speak seven languages
and five dialects.

224
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,940
French, German...

225
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,140
Then just ask them where
the flaming airplane is.

226
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,420
Yeah.

227
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,940
What is all this ridiculous...

228
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,220
Wait a minute.

229
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,540
Dr. Hayden.

230
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,500
No, no, I'm afraid I...

231
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,940
You have, uh,
enemy survivors here.

232
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,620
This is a hospital, Captain.

233
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,700
I must know where...

234
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,820
Hospital here.

235
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,780
No, he mustn't be moved.

236
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,900
He's badly hurt.

237
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,260
Please, I don't understand...

238
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,180
No, he's badly hurt.
He's ill. lll.

239
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,820
But, Captain...

240
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,740
Necessity.

241
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,780
Find... uh, not to find.

242
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,060
Responsibility.

243
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,460
<i>Tonight, Air Force fliers</i>

244
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,780
<i>who have been cooperating</i>

245
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,860
<i>with the Third Army ground
forces in Czechoslovakia,</i>

246
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,140
<i>and they give me
a fantastic picture.</i>

247
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,100
<i>One of them told me
he saw columns of...</i>

248
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,060
<i>...ten miles long
on several roads.</i>

249
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,580
<i>...away from the Russians,
toward us.</i>

250
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,900
<i>In those columns were both
soldiers and civilians.</i>

251
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,100
You were right.

252
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,180
There was a German submarine.

253
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,900
They came up here
and shot him.

254
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,300
Bastards.

255
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,860
I'm bewildered, Mr. Murphy.

256
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,860
I mean, why...?

257
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,500
What happened out there?

258
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,220
They shot the entire crew
in the water.

259
00:25:16,255 --> 00:25:18,380
Every suffering...

260
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,900
Except me.

261
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,780
Flying jacket.

262
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,380
I didn't see that.

263
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,505
You weren't intended to.

264
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:45,420
He didn't want them to know
there was an airplane.

265
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,820
Thank you...
Flying Officer Murphy.

266
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,900
Cover him up and say some words.

267
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,020
He was a particular friend
of yours, wasn't...?

268
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,900
An officer?

269
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,180
I got the impression
you rather liked him.

270
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,740
Come on, Louis,
take her up, take her up!

271
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,620
Easy, Louis.

272
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,980
Easy.

273
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,180
Easy, easy, easy!

274
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,420
Forward!

275
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,500
Good on you, Louis.

276
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,820
Your blood's worth bottling.

277
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,820
You know machines?

278
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,340
What?

279
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,820
You know machines?

280
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,740
I love them.

281
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,580
I've got a feeling
I've found her

282
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,180
It was something she said

283
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,580
She's got me walking
on the tip of my toes

284
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,540
And my hat's
on the side of my head

285
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,780
All of my troubles are mended

286
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,380
She's my needle and thread

287
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,140
She's got me walking
on the tip of my toes

288
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,380
And my hat's
on the side of my head...

289
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,860
I've got a feeling
I've found her

290
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,220
It was something she said...

291
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:14,380
All along Thomas Street
down by the Liffe

292
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:18,580
The sunshine was gone
and the evening grew dark

293
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,785
Me arms were around her...

294
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,660
Ah, you're doing well,
me old frog-eater.

295
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,860
The company will give you
a gold watch.

296
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,900
I shall be happy
with my four years' back pay.

297
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,340
Four years?

298
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,540
Yeah.

299
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,060
That's an awful lot of pennies.

300
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,540
You sure they're good for it?

301
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,340
It is a very reliable company.

302
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,180
I have full confidence
in their integrity,

303
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,740
and if not,
I will write them a letter.

304
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,420
Can you fly?

305
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,780
Who do you think kept
this flying lavatory together?

306
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,340
Every scrap of her
is in me fingers.

307
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,580
Yes, but can you fly her?

308
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,340
Don't worry, my old son,
I'll get her up.

309
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,500
And if you do?

310
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,380
I'll find
that bastard bum submarine.

311
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,500
What about getting her down?

312
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,180
Ah, that I know I can do.

313
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,980
Forgive me, but are you sure
that, uh... hmm?

314
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,940
Stop blathering, lad!

315
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,860
The war will be over
before I do anything!

316
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,820
Now, shut up

317
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,140
and cast me off.

318
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,100
Madness.

319
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,980
Come on.

320
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,020
Swing me around.

321
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,860
Fly, you bastard! Fly!

322
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,900
Fool.

323
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,940
Oh, Louis! Louis! Louis!

324
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,700
The feeling!

325
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,380
Oh, Jesus!

326
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,820
No submarine?

327
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,820
Y- You're a bird!

328
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,180
Yeah, but you didn't find
the submarine.

329
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,740
Certainly I found her.

330
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,420
Sitting on its fast ass
up the river.

331
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,060
But they didn't see you?

332
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,660
Certainly they saw me.

333
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,100
Now, uh, a couple
of things to do-

334
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,220
some kip, then I'm going back.

335
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,460
For what purpose
are you going back?

336
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,380
I'm going to sink her.

337
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,660
You see it fly up?

338
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,120
Whoom... you see.

339
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,400
I got it up over the trees.

340
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,160
But you have no weapons.
Petrol.

341
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,720
But the bitch keeps
trying to drag ya down.

342
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,320
But if you give it
a bit more stick-

343
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,440
just like a woman...

344
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,720
- Petrol?
- Yeah, petrol.

345
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,480
But what are you going to do
with petrol?

346
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,080
...a bit more throttle,
you see...

347
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,560
But they have guns
on the submarine?

348
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,880
Yeah, a big bastard
in the front

349
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,400
and then a little fellow
afterwards.

350
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,680
Up she goes!

351
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,480
And of course they will let you
pour petrol all over them

352
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,320
and then watch you
put a match to it.

353
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,280
They might.

354
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,560
They might just do that.

355
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,725
They might.
They might, yes.

356
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,440
They possess your lack
of common sense.

357
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,520
Ah, don't be...

358
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,600
Morning, sir.

359
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,920
What are you doing?

360
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,720
Uh, just borrowing
a couple of your bottles.

361
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,680
Really?

362
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,560
What on earth for?

363
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,720
Uh, I'm refueling the plane,
then I'll be flying off.

364
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,640
I take it your experiments
with the plane were successful.

365
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,045
Great, great.

366
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,600
Have you been taking
your tablets?

367
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,560
Oh, yes.

368
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,480
Well, then,
there's really nothing

369
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,760
to keep you, is there?

370
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,360
How soon will you be going?

371
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,360
Shortly.

372
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,520
I'd be so grateful

373
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,960
if you'd do something for me.

374
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,040
I'll make up a list of things
we need here.

375
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,280
Would you be good enough
to take it with you?

376
00:45:28,315 --> 00:45:29,240
Oh, certainly.

377
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,200
Oh, that's marv.

378
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,200
Thank you very much.

379
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,200
Okay, Louis, the timer.

380
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,800
Louis, the doctor lady-
she's a Quaker.

381
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,200
Mm-hmm.

382
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,000
That's like being a bloody nun,
isn't it?

383
00:46:43,035 --> 00:46:44,245
No.

384
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,165
I don't think so.

385
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,320
Why couldn't she be
a young nurse?

386
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,020
Something practical.

387
00:46:50,055 --> 00:46:51,680
Light the fuse, please.

388
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,960
She has fair form.

389
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,640
Do you ever have any, uh...?

390
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,720
Four seconds.

391
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,080
Never take a crack?

392
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,920
I have great respect for her.

393
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,040
Now.

394
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,760
Provide an essential service

395
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,600
by piloting her
from here to there in my boat.

396
00:47:12,635 --> 00:47:13,877
Six seconds.

397
00:47:13,912 --> 00:47:15,120
Six seconds?

398
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,240
Yeah.

399
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,920
Two and half feet at...

400
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,280
And that's about
nine inches a second.

401
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,400
Here, try the long fellow.

402
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,520
Hmm.

403
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,040
See if it stays the same.

404
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,600
How long have you been here,
Louis?

405
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,000
On your lonesome?

406
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,280
Oh, about six
and half years now.

407
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,560
Six and a half years.

408
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,480
That's an awful long time.

409
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,080
I've known fellows without it
for six months, go bald.

410
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,560
Eight seconds.

411
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,600
Bald?

412
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,080
But this is not my property.

413
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:00,680
The company only uses explosives
in case of oil fire.

414
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,960
Exactly.

415
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,800
Murphy.

416
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,960
Aah, shut up.

417
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
No. What would I say
to my company?

418
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,080
Show them your...

419
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,240
All right.

420
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,720
Be careful with it,
Murphy, please.

421
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,840
Don't worry.

422
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,280
I know what I'm doing.

423
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,800
How did you learn to make bombs?

424
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,720
From watching me daddy
who made them for noble causes.

425
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,680
Now, hold that.

426
00:48:54,715 --> 00:48:56,600
There.

427
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,320
You have the whole of it...

428
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,160
On the radio,

429
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,680
they say they are surrendering
everywhere.

430
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,880
It's only a question
of hours now

431
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,260
before peace is declared.

432
00:49:19,295 --> 00:49:20,600
They say the Italians...

433
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,200
It works!

434
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,400
It works!

435
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,880
Okay, my son.

436
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,300
Hello.

437
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:44,780
What a delightful hat
you're wearing, Mr. Murphy.

438
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:45,740
You like it?

439
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,780
I always did.

440
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,180
You outta nail it down.

441
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,540
Here it is.

442
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:53,620
You see, I've listed everything
in order of priority.

443
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,500
One-

444
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,500
see that's delivered

445
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,300
to the Society
of Friends in London.

446
00:49:58,340 --> 00:49:59,700
- Right you be.
- Two-

447
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:02,780
tell your people it's imperative
we have a new transmitter.

448
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:03,940
Right you be.

449
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,380
- Three-
- Jesus!

450
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,260
take your tablets.

451
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:11,220
Now.

452
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,580
Uh, if I was you, missus,
I wouldn't stand there.

453
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,540
This fellow makes
an awful clatter...

454
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,660
Oh. Oh, yes, certainly.

455
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,900
Yes, of course.

456
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,340
Way to go, Louis!

457
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,980
Good luck.

458
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,420
Thank you.

459
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,220
Okay, Louis, take him up.

460
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:34,660
What are the bottles doing
there, Louis?

461
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,940
Bottles?

462
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:41,500
Those are the world's largest
Molotov cocktail bombs.

463
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:43,940
Bombs?

464
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:44,980
Come on, Louis!

465
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,660
Take her up! Take her up!

466
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,380
But what are they for?

467
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,580
He intends to drop
them on the submarine.

468
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,500
He's mad!

469
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:57,180
Okay, Louis, swing her out.

470
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,140
Murphy,

471
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,580
you can't do this!

472
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,140
Why not?

473
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:13,020
Louis, stop that thing!

474
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,020
Louis, start that thing.

475
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,580
This is pointless!

476
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,620
The war's almost over.

477
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,740
Listen to her, Murphy.

478
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,300
She may be right.

479
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,180
Louis, if you don't
lower me down,

480
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:30,420
I'll gut you.

481
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,860
No, Louis. Don't!

482
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,140
This is so wrong!

483
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:55,380
Tell that to the bastards
on the bottom of the ocean!

484
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:59,580
I know how you feel,
and what they did was dreadful,

485
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:03,020
but one senseless killing
after another...

486
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,140
Killing?

487
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,220
If I'm lucky.

488
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,905
And if you're not lucky,

489
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:10,180
have you thought
what might happen to us here?

490
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,340
Don't worry, missus.

491
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:14,140
They'll be nothing left
of them Germans but shit.

492
00:52:14,175 --> 00:52:15,420
You're enjoying it!

493
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:16,900
That's right.

494
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,460
You love your war, don't you?

495
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,700
The war?

496
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,545
Yeah.

497
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,985
I started it.

498
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:28,700
The whole flaming thing,
didn't I?

499
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,100
Will you think?

500
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,380
Don't worry, missus.

501
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:36,025
It isn't really a submarine.

502
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,260
It's just a little old
alligator, remember?

503
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:44,420
You mindless bastard!

504
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,660
I sunk the whore, Louis.

505
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:58,340
The whole flaming issue
up in the air.

506
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:59,420
Yes, I know. She told me.

507
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,500
- She told you, huh?
- Yeah.

508
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,380
Yeah, she stuck a blunt needle
in me.

509
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,220
You can help me raise him,
Louis.

510
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,300
Mm-hmm.

511
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,180
Now, gently does it.

512
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,260
W- What's going on now?

513
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,660
You have a fractured rib.

514
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:25,740
Keep still.

515
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:26,940
Thank you, Louis.

516
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,300
Put your arms out.

517
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:32,460
Oh, Louis,
you should have been there.

518
00:59:32,495 --> 00:59:33,700
It was beautiful.

519
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,060
I wish I had been there.

520
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,220
Not so tight.

521
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:40,300
Frankly,
I'd like to choke you with it.

522
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:48,780
Onward, Christian soldiers

523
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:51,300
Marching... Ooh!

524
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,020
I am so happy for you.

525
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,740
Ah, Jesus, careful.

526
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:56,980
Yes, please, be careful.

527
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:58,580
We have to look after him.

528
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,380
He has been through
a great ordeal.

529
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,060
Thank you for your advice,
Louis.

530
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,980
I'll try to do my best
for your hero.

531
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,620
Meanwhile, would you revert
to your usual practice

532
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,580
of saying and doing nothing?

533
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,820
He doesn't need your support.

534
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,660
You shouldn't have said that
to Louis.

535
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:26,940
He's a good old froggy.

536
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:28,700
You have an awful tongue
on you.

537
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,020
Would you lie down, please?

538
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,140
Ah, come on.

539
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:32,740
What's wrong with you?

540
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:35,260
We should be celebrating.

541
01:00:35,295 --> 01:00:37,740
Celebrating what, Mr. Murphy?

542
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,780
Your arrival here?

543
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:42,140
Or the death of those Germans?

544
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:47,060
What's that for?

545
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,460
It's going to put you to sleep.

546
01:00:48,495 --> 01:00:49,820
Hope you sharpened it
this time.

547
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:50,980
Don't make me waste this.

548
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:52,220
We haven't much of it left.

549
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:53,900
You don't have
a drop of something...?

550
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:56,140
No.

551
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:57,900
Ah, no whiskey in the house,

552
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:01,100
no light in the window,
no welcome at the door.

553
01:01:01,135 --> 01:01:02,780
Call me wealthy.

554
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,620
What are you grinning for?

555
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,140
Give us a kiss.

556
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:17,300
Good night, Mr. Murphy.

557
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:26,500
And what's it to anyone
whether or no

558
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:31,300
Whether I'm easy
or whether I'm true...?

559
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:38,140
Louis?

560
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:48,780
I'm sorry, Louis.

561
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:49,740
Forgive me.

562
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,060
I was upset.

563
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,700
That Murphy seems
to affect us all.

564
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:00,500
It's not necessary
to discuss it.

565
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:05,100
We have been friends
for a long time.

566
01:02:05,135 --> 01:02:07,620
I didn't mean what I said.

567
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:10,060
Without you...

568
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:14,460
Good night, Louis.

569
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:37,340
Fire!

570
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,560
Where is he, Doctor?

571
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,360
Mr. Murphy?!

572
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,560
Murphy!

573
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:04,640
Missus.

574
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,840
Murphy?

575
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,400
Here.

576
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,480
I thought I'd sunk her.

577
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,440
I didn't.

578
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,520
No.

579
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:21,720
Sorry for your trouble.

580
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,080
It's over now.

581
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,400
Louis!

582
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,920
Yeah.

583
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,240
They didn't find you?

584
01:12:02,275 --> 01:12:03,280
Oh, no.

585
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,240
How are you?

586
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,200
Sound.

587
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,160
Dr. Hayden?

588
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,120
She's okay.

589
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,280
Submarine attacked the village.

590
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,240
Yes.

591
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,200
But I saw...

592
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,160
Yes, yes, me, too.

593
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,320
Have to go and help...

594
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,600
Did they touch the barge?

595
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,360
No, not at all. No.

596
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,440
When's the last time
you took it out?

597
01:12:18,475 --> 01:12:20,480
It's about...
about six years ago.

598
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,000
Actually,
it's a funny story because...

599
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,920
Yeah, come with me...

600
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:53,580
This is London calling.

601
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:56,660
Here is a recorded dispatch
from Chester Wilmot.

602
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:59,140
The dispatch comes from Germany.

603
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,580
<i>Hello, BBC.</i>

604
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:04,180
<i>This is Chester Wilmot speaking
from a BBC transmitter</i>

605
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:06,065
<i>in northern Germany.</i>

606
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:10,260
<i>This afternoon at 6:30,
British Double Summer Time,</i>

607
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,980
<i>at Field Marshall Montgomery's
tactical headquarters,</i>

608
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:14,700
<i>German plenipotentiaries</i>

609
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:17,580
<i>signed the documents which
will end the war in Europe</i>

610
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:21,260
<i>for the 21st Army group
at 8:00 tomorrow morning.</i>

611
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,300
<i>That means the surrender of...</i>

612
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:43,660
<i>The German war is
therefore at an end.</i>

613
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:45,540
<i>After years
of intense struggle...</i>

614
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:50,220
Why did you do that?

615
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:52,820
Another bloody bullfight.

616
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:54,060
Ole, ole, ole.

617
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:55,380
Driving me crackers.

618
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:59,980
What the hell are we doing?

619
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,700
I'm going to kill
that submarine.

620
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:02,860
With what?

621
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:04,420
I'm going to ram her with this.

622
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:06,180
With my house?!

623
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:07,980
Aw, don't fret.

624
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:09,820
The bullets will bounce off her.

625
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:11,460
Will they bounce off people?

626
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:41,300
Mr. Murphy!

627
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:45,780
Mr. Murphy.

628
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,540
Mr. Murphy!

629
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:22,300
The war is over!

630
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:24,380
Mr. Murphy!

631
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:26,940
Louis!

632
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:36,700
Louis, the war is over!

633
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:40,060
She's shouting something.

634
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,940
Another flamin' lecture!

635
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:44,140
Now get down
and check the engines.

636
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:45,900
Ah, I can operate from here.

637
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:47,900
Will you just check
the bloody things?

638
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:37,000
English.

639
01:19:37,035 --> 01:19:38,940
English!

640
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:41,180
Can't be talking to me.

641
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:43,500
War end.

642
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:45,980
Finished.

643
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:06,740
Turn ship or I'll attack.

644
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,140
What will he do?

645
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:16,500
Pull out and try and set us up
for a torpedo.

646
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:20,700
But you said nothing
about torpedo.

647
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:22,260
Must have forgot.

648
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:28,780
War over!

649
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:31,620
Germany surrendered!

650
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,420
Now, give me full speed
when I ask for it,

651
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:35,620
and then reverse.

652
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:36,820
But don't you hear?

653
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:38,380
Murphy, the war is over.

654
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:39,660
Their war, not mine.

655
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:42,220
The war is over.

656
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:43,700
Full speed!

657
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,380
Fire.

658
01:23:30,540 --> 01:23:32,020
Here it comes.

659
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:36,620
Full ahead port!

660
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:06,380
Missed.

661
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:08,780
It's going to hit the beach!

662
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:26,900
Come on, my son.

663
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:04,740
Come on.

664
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:07,140
Come on, my son!

665
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:24,460
Come on, my son!

666
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:55,060
Missed the bastard!

667
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:57,020
Three feet!

668
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:05,060
Full reverse starboard!

669
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:15,060
What more can we do?

670
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:16,740
I'm going to follow him.

671
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:18,140
Follow him?

672
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:19,580
Here?

673
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:22,220
There's nothing else I can do.

674
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:32,260
Now, full ahead.

675
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:44,260
Louis...

676
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:46,420
cut the engines.

677
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:01,580
What does it mean?

678
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:04,020
I don't know.

679
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:14,820
Could be blowing air
from his tanks.

680
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:25,580
He's run... he's... he's run
his bow on the bank.

681
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:28,620
We have him, Louis!

682
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:29,900
Full speed ahead!

683
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:31,380
We have the bastard!

684
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:34,180
Come on!

685
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:43,540
Hey.

686
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:48,340
You're running aground!

687
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:50,220
Lower the jib.

688
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:55,340
Lower the jib!

689
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:09,900
Come on, come on.

690
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:16,920
More wire.

691
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,680
Give me more wire.

692
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,080
Whatcha doing?

693
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,720
Their lines are bursting.

694
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,960
He's not even in trouble.

695
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,520
Let her die in peace.

696
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:05,400
He'll get out!

697
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:08,040
And I will never find him!

698
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:11,520
Possibly, possibly not.

699
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:13,440
I have done enough!

700
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:21,920
Louis!

701
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:23,680
I'm not able on my own!

702
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,640
You're a small
and lonely man, Murphy...

703
01:31:28,675 --> 01:31:30,160
...like me.

704
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:33,720
The world will never build us
a monument.

705
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,800
The difference is,
I know that.

706
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:26,040
I have you!

707
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:03,280
Jesus!
