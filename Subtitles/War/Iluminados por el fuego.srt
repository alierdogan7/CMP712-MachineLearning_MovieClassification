00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:48,225
BUENOS AIRES,
DECEMBER 2001

2
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:57,696
We're rebelling!

3
00:00:57,836 --> 00:01:00,066
We demand freedom
for all those imprisoned...

4
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:01,968
for fighting for their rights.

5
00:01:02,107 --> 00:01:04,075
We want health care and education.

6
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:06,541
We want jobs, comrades!

7
00:01:06,678 --> 00:01:08,236
We say No to hunger.

8
00:01:08,513 --> 00:01:10,105
No to repression.

9
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,883
Stop stealing!
You bastards!

10
00:01:56,094 --> 00:01:58,062
Stop stealing from us!

11
00:02:05,637 --> 00:02:08,697
Let the people decide
and govern this country!

12
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,777
Get rid of them all!
Let's go to the Plaza de Mayo!

13
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:13,129
Hello?

14
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:19,837
Yes.

15
00:03:26,918 --> 00:03:27,748
Where?

16
00:03:38,263 --> 00:03:39,753
I'm on my way.

17
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:06,022
What have you got?
-An attempted suicide.

18
00:04:06,157 --> 00:04:08,455
Alcohol, drugs, pills...

19
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:09,924
What else?
-There's no pulse.

20
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:13,519
Give me the tube.

21
00:04:13,665 --> 00:04:15,724
What's on the monitor?

22
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:19,030
Have we got the airway?

23
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,035
It's clear. Massage.

24
00:04:21,172 --> 00:04:22,605
Insert it.

25
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:26,168
Hold it a minute.
-Wait, let me detach this.

26
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:27,801
Ready?

27
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:30,514
Keep going.

28
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:32,617
What's on the monitor?
-Still no pulse.

29
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:38,813
Stand back.

30
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:43,858
Good evening.
Casualty?

31
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:46,062
Thank you.

32
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:59,700
ENLIGHTENED BY FIRE

33
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:12,167
Marta?

34
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:14,005
Esteban.

35
00:07:14,145 --> 00:07:18,582
I'm sorry, I called you,
I didn't know what to do.

36
00:07:18,716 --> 00:07:20,616
That's OK.
What happened?

37
00:07:20,752 --> 00:07:22,879
I knew he was going to do it.

38
00:07:23,254 --> 00:07:24,721
I knew it.

39
00:07:24,856 --> 00:07:26,721
It's my fault.

40
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:31,723
Calm down, it's not your fault.
What happened?

41
00:07:33,698 --> 00:07:35,563
He mixed everything.

42
00:07:37,802 --> 00:07:41,169
Brandy, coke, pills,
everything.

43
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:44,764
If I hadn't found him,
he'd be dead now.

44
00:07:47,912 --> 00:07:50,210
Have the doctors
told you anything?

45
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:53,008
They asked some questions.

46
00:07:54,352 --> 00:07:56,286
They told me to wait.

47
00:07:56,554 --> 00:07:57,646
All right.

48
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:10,633
Vargas?

49
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:13,259
How is he?
What's going to happen, doctor?

50
00:08:13,638 --> 00:08:16,163
Who are you?
-I'm his wife.

51
00:08:16,307 --> 00:08:17,797
I'm a friend.

52
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,802
He's in a coma,...

53
00:08:20,945 --> 00:08:26,076
on a ventilator, because
he can't breathe on his own.

54
00:08:26,684 --> 00:08:29,619
At this moment,
there is no ocular reflex,...

55
00:08:29,754 --> 00:08:33,656
he's not moving
his arms or his legs...

56
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,783
or responding
to painful stimulus.

57
00:08:37,028 --> 00:08:40,725
It's still too early
to say anything.

58
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:42,162
We have to wait.

59
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:56,546
Over 290 veterans
had committed suicide.

60
00:08:57,348 --> 00:08:59,714
The number of suicides
was equal...

61
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:03,514
to the deaths on the Islands
during the war.

62
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:08,555
The photos in the scandal press
were shocking.

63
00:09:08,826 --> 00:09:12,626
Faces and bodies
showing signs of suicide.

64
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:14,789
But seeing Vargas,...

65
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:17,632
finding him there,...

66
00:09:18,202 --> 00:09:22,070
between life and death
in a hospital bed,...

67
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,071
was something else.

68
00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:28,141
The Malvinas came back again...

69
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:31,649
and covered everything.

70
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:56,639
What's wrong?

71
00:09:57,141 --> 00:09:58,733
Can't you sleep?

72
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:01,077
No, it's all right.

73
00:10:01,212 --> 00:10:04,113
Go back to sleep.
I'll watch TV for a while.

74
00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:31,199
AIR BRIGADE IX,
APRIL 1982

75
00:10:34,612 --> 00:10:35,943
Everybody out!

76
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,607
Group 3 with me, on the double!

77
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,544
Move it, soldiers!

78
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:46,155
Come on!

79
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:49,986
Attention!
-Attention!

80
00:10:50,128 --> 00:10:51,686
Get your kitbags!

81
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:53,592
Group 1, on the double!

82
00:10:56,634 --> 00:10:59,831
Group 3 with me!

83
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:04,836
Come on, soldiers!

84
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:09,570
On the double!

85
00:11:09,814 --> 00:11:12,044
Attention!
-Attention!

86
00:11:12,183 --> 00:11:13,150
Reports!

87
00:11:13,284 --> 00:11:14,751
Support group, all quiet.

88
00:11:14,886 --> 00:11:15,875
Group 3, all quiet.

89
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,248
Group 2, all quiet.

90
00:11:17,522 --> 00:11:18,716
Group 1, all quiet.

91
00:11:18,856 --> 00:11:20,949
Attention!
-Attention!

92
00:11:21,092 --> 00:11:22,787
At ease!

93
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:26,656
Fall out!

94
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,633
Permission to speak.

95
00:11:34,972 --> 00:11:37,031
Come here, soldier!

96
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:41,501
What is it?
-The bathroom, sir.

97
00:11:43,648 --> 00:11:45,013
Two minutes.

98
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:46,616
On the double!

99
00:11:47,585 --> 00:11:49,246
I said, on the double!

100
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:13,404
Hello, mom!

101
00:12:13,544 --> 00:12:14,806
It's Esteban.

102
00:12:15,913 --> 00:12:17,540
In Comodoro.

103
00:12:17,982 --> 00:12:20,815
Mom, I'm fine, I'm fine.

104
00:12:20,952 --> 00:12:24,012
I'm fine, but listen.
Can you hear me?

105
00:12:24,155 --> 00:12:25,816
I'm going to the Malvinas.

106
00:12:30,828 --> 00:12:33,820
I love you too.
Please, don't cry, I'm all right.

107
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:37,093
I don't have much time,
we'll be cut off in a minute.

108
00:12:37,235 --> 00:12:40,261
No, I sneaked off to call you.

109
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:45,567
I'll send you a letter about
everything that's going on.

110
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,508
Can you hear me? Mom?

111
00:12:48,813 --> 00:12:51,281
Hello? Hello?

112
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:52,675
Mom?

113
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:09,396
The world should know...

114
00:13:09,534 --> 00:13:14,904
that a country which is
as fiercely determined...

115
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,667
as Argentina is,...

116
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:22,140
will stand up to anyone.
Let them come if they want!

117
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:46,569
Few Argentineans doubt
that it was a military tragedy...

118
00:13:46,704 --> 00:13:49,639
and a severe setback
for the country's chances

119
00:13:49,774 --> 00:13:51,833
of recovering the Malvinas,...

120
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:55,537
seized by England 150 years ago.

121
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,941
The British Prime Minister
took the opportunity...

122
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:04,111
to consolidate
her political position...

123
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:07,782
which was in deep crisis
at that time...

124
00:15:07,618 --> 00:15:09,279
That's all I could get.

125
00:15:09,587 --> 00:15:11,885
You want it on tape?
-Yeah.

126
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:14,014
Let me finish this first.

127
00:16:03,674 --> 00:16:04,902
Alberto...

128
00:16:06,577 --> 00:16:08,477
Can you hear me?

129
00:16:08,612 --> 00:16:09,943
Alberto...

130
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:12,910
Look who's come to see you.

131
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:17,246
Love, do you know who's here?

132
00:16:17,588 --> 00:16:18,919
It's Esteban.

133
00:16:20,257 --> 00:16:22,088
He's come to see you.

134
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:24,057
We're here with you.

135
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:27,190
Come back, my love.

136
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:32,092
Come back, darling.
I'm here with you,...

137
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:33,703
come back.

138
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:56,092
MALVINAS, MAY 1982

139
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,884
What's the problem?
-Private Alarcon is sick.

140
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:35,284
What's wrong?
-I can't feel my foot, sir.

141
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,122
Let me see.

142
00:18:47,872 --> 00:18:50,636
OK, take him to the infirmary,
quickly.

143
00:18:50,774 --> 00:18:52,071
Yes, sir.

144
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:39,178
Attention!

145
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:42,587
Attention!

146
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:47,220
For Lt. Gilbert,...

147
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:50,925
eyes right!

148
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,805
Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

149
00:19:59,977 --> 00:20:02,775
Group all present,
with the following report.

150
00:20:02,913 --> 00:20:05,711
Private Alarcon is sick.

151
00:20:06,283 --> 00:20:07,944
Thank you, sergeant.

152
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:15,887
Soldiers,...

153
00:20:16,827 --> 00:20:17,816
good morning!

154
00:20:17,962 --> 00:20:19,930
Good morning, sir!

155
00:20:20,931 --> 00:20:22,626
At ease!

156
00:20:37,615 --> 00:20:39,708
I don't see fiber, soldiers.

157
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:42,552
I don't see morale.

158
00:20:43,287 --> 00:20:47,246
I see a bunch of sissies
and half-hearted recruits,...

159
00:20:47,658 --> 00:20:50,126
shit scared and freezing cold,...

160
00:20:50,527 --> 00:20:52,654
who don't understand...

161
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:57,030
and don't want to believe
we're going to win this war.

162
00:20:58,802 --> 00:21:00,963
If you thought a bit,...

163
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:02,868
you'd realize...

164
00:21:03,274 --> 00:21:07,472
that we have been here
for months,...

165
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:11,046
preparing our defenses
for months.

166
00:21:12,182 --> 00:21:16,710
Carefully preparing our defenses!

167
00:21:16,854 --> 00:21:18,947
But not our supplies.

168
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:21,819
They, on the other hand...

169
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,722
Think about it.

170
00:21:24,061 --> 00:21:27,462
They've spent all that time
inside their ships.

171
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:30,225
Imagine the shape they're in.

172
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:34,603
Coming so far by ship...

173
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:37,707
and then landing
on these unknown islands.

174
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:39,274
For God's sake, soldiers,...

175
00:21:39,543 --> 00:21:42,478
they're not even used to the cold!

176
00:21:42,613 --> 00:21:44,808
As if I were used to it
in Corrientes.

177
00:21:44,948 --> 00:21:46,848
You have been chosen...

178
00:21:47,284 --> 00:21:51,618
to defend our homeland
from the invading enemy!

179
00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:53,880
Cold doesn't exist!

180
00:21:54,024 --> 00:21:55,753
Hunger doesn't exist!

181
00:21:55,893 --> 00:21:58,521
Only God and our homeland!

182
00:21:58,762 --> 00:22:00,957
Hurrah for our homeland!
-Hurrah!

183
00:22:01,098 --> 00:22:03,430
Hurrah for our homeland!
-Hurrah!

184
00:22:06,904 --> 00:22:09,065
Fuck the gurkhas!

185
00:22:09,606 --> 00:22:11,972
Fuck the gurkha, soldiers!

186
00:22:12,276 --> 00:22:15,143
Those guys are dead already.

187
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:16,940
They'll have to get the hell
out of here!

188
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:20,517
Red Alert!

189
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:47,442
Any wounded?

190
00:22:47,578 --> 00:22:49,910
All normal, sir.

191
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:56,916
Get them into position, quickly!

192
00:22:57,054 --> 00:22:58,681
Right away, sir.

193
00:22:58,822 --> 00:23:00,187
Soldiers!

194
00:23:49,907 --> 00:23:51,875
This bread gets harder every day.

195
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:53,704
It's like a rock.

196
00:23:53,911 --> 00:23:56,812
But this is hotter
than a black stripper.

197
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,916
Look at poor Pinasco.

198
00:24:04,555 --> 00:24:06,284
He's all fucked up.

199
00:24:07,257 --> 00:24:09,725
He wanted to eat porridge
with piss.

200
00:24:12,129 --> 00:24:13,528
When?

201
00:24:13,664 --> 00:24:15,564
The other day, he said...

202
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:18,029
he couldn't take any more,...

203
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:20,159
and if he ate that,
he'd get...

204
00:24:20,304 --> 00:24:22,772
What's it called?
-Hepatitis.

205
00:24:22,973 --> 00:24:25,635
And he'd be sent back home.

206
00:24:26,877 --> 00:24:30,210
If that didn't work,
he'd shoot himself in the leg.

207
00:24:30,347 --> 00:24:31,974
He doesn't want to be here.

208
00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:34,106
He cries all night.

209
00:24:34,351 --> 00:24:36,581
The "porridge and piss"
doesn't work.

210
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,984
You know how many have tried it?

211
00:24:39,223 --> 00:24:42,192
You know what piss is?
This is piss.

212
00:24:42,326 --> 00:24:46,023
Here, take this,
it's Pizarro's piss.

213
00:24:47,164 --> 00:24:49,928
I'm off.
Come on, let's go.

214
00:24:56,006 --> 00:24:57,837
Got a cough?

215
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,507
If my mom saw me now,
she'd have a heart attack.

216
00:25:03,647 --> 00:25:04,944
She's always saying,

217
00:25:05,082 --> 00:25:07,607
"Betito, wrap up warm,
you'll freeze".

218
00:25:08,986 --> 00:25:12,581
I can warm you up real easy.
-Our camp faggot!

219
00:25:12,723 --> 00:25:15,715
Go see Corporal Dumas,
he likes brunettes like you.

220
00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:16,985
Come on, move!

221
00:25:18,862 --> 00:25:20,796
Get moving!

222
00:25:44,187 --> 00:25:45,882
He was unlucky.

223
00:25:46,857 --> 00:25:48,882
It all went wrong for him.

224
00:25:50,127 --> 00:25:51,856
For us.

225
00:26:03,974 --> 00:26:05,601
Do you have kids?

226
00:26:05,976 --> 00:26:07,671
Yes, a daughter, Sofia.

227
00:26:07,811 --> 00:26:08,903
Sofia?

228
00:26:10,113 --> 00:26:11,876
A pretty name.

229
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:20,122
We had a great time together.

230
00:26:23,193 --> 00:26:25,491
We had some lovely years.

231
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:29,765
He made no money
with the garage...

232
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:32,499
but he really enjoyed it.

233
00:26:33,637 --> 00:26:35,070
Crazy guy!

234
00:26:39,876 --> 00:26:43,903
When he had to close it,
he got a job in a factory.

235
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:46,948
You know he was very handy
with tools.

236
00:26:51,355 --> 00:26:53,949
Yes, we had a great time.

237
00:26:54,658 --> 00:26:57,024
We had a great time for years.

238
00:27:00,263 --> 00:27:02,697
Then they closed the factory.

239
00:27:03,834 --> 00:27:07,167
He had no job...

240
00:27:07,304 --> 00:27:11,104
and like all the veterans
ha had to beg in the street.

241
00:27:13,543 --> 00:27:16,068
We started to go downhill
way down,...

242
00:27:16,947 --> 00:27:19,108
and we never stopped
until now.

243
00:27:56,086 --> 00:27:58,782
There's a group of them,
about twenty or so.

244
00:27:58,922 --> 00:28:00,651
Take a look.

245
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,923
What do we do?
-Attack separately.

246
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:10,863
What?
-Attack separately.

247
00:28:11,768 --> 00:28:13,759
You come with me.

248
00:28:13,904 --> 00:28:15,735
I'll give the order.

249
00:28:16,006 --> 00:28:17,234
Let's go.

250
00:29:03,286 --> 00:29:06,221
I've got it, help me!

251
00:29:10,594 --> 00:29:13,563
Esteban, Dad's got the meat.

252
00:29:13,697 --> 00:29:15,562
A barbecue for three.

253
00:29:21,805 --> 00:29:23,796
Come on, let's go.

254
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,771
We should shag it first.

255
00:30:06,483 --> 00:30:08,576
Private Chamorro Juan,...

256
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:11,080
you fed us today.

257
00:30:11,555 --> 00:30:12,783
And, look.

258
00:30:15,592 --> 00:30:18,527
Right on time,
with English punctuality.

259
00:30:19,963 --> 00:30:22,864
If Pizarro sees that
he'll stick it up your ass.

260
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:26,867
How will he know I swiped it
from the officers' quarters?

261
00:30:27,003 --> 00:30:31,497
Look, one day I'll grab him, tear
off his lieutenant's stripe,...

262
00:30:31,641 --> 00:30:34,906
have him serving us hot drinks
and he won't even notice.

263
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:40,914
Hey, tell me,...

264
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:43,676
where did you learn
to kill animals?

265
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,618
In the country, whatever walks
ends on the grill.

266
00:30:48,091 --> 00:30:51,288
Every week we kill
at least two chickens.

267
00:30:52,996 --> 00:30:54,930
And in the winter, a pig.

268
00:30:55,332 --> 00:30:57,027
Can you imagine?

269
00:30:58,268 --> 00:31:01,066
Do pigs really squeal a lot
when they're killed?

270
00:31:01,805 --> 00:31:03,136
Like pigs.

271
00:31:07,077 --> 00:31:09,568
I've never seen a sheep
like that,...

272
00:31:10,146 --> 00:31:12,546
with its fleece and dead.

273
00:31:12,883 --> 00:31:15,647
In Barracas, all we kill
are mosquitoes.

274
00:31:20,023 --> 00:31:21,888
Don't you miss your girl?

275
00:31:26,162 --> 00:31:28,130
I miss her loads,...

276
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:32,159
especially now
we're living together.

277
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,695
I left home to live with her.

278
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,236
Some day we'll have kids,
get married...

279
00:31:41,511 --> 00:31:43,604
Or not, I don't know.

280
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:47,243
But now we're really keen.

281
00:31:51,855 --> 00:31:54,085
Remember that letter I got?
-Yeah.

282
00:31:54,224 --> 00:31:55,714
It was from her.

283
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,551
When I finished reading it
I put it here.

284
00:32:01,698 --> 00:32:06,032
It gave me a kind of warmth,
I didn't feel so scared.

285
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,731
If you saw how she writes.

286
00:32:09,873 --> 00:32:11,033
It's good?

287
00:32:14,144 --> 00:32:16,135
When I'm reading it,...

288
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,049
it's like she's beside me
while I'm reading it.

289
00:32:20,183 --> 00:32:22,447
Then she goes away.

290
00:32:24,988 --> 00:32:27,889
But she only sent me one letter.

291
00:32:29,526 --> 00:32:32,154
She might have sent you
a thousand.

292
00:32:32,295 --> 00:32:34,627
These shits give us nothing.

293
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:36,994
No packages, no food, nothing.

294
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:39,962
No, she just sent one.

295
00:32:41,871 --> 00:32:46,205
A week before I was told
about being sent here,...

296
00:32:47,177 --> 00:32:49,702
I had a terrible row with her.

297
00:32:49,913 --> 00:32:54,941
On my day off, I didn't go home,
I stayed in the barracks...

298
00:32:55,085 --> 00:32:57,576
and we all went out dancing.

299
00:32:57,721 --> 00:32:59,689
I didn't even tell her.

300
00:33:00,824 --> 00:33:04,123
And I think I'm being pissed on
by all the penguins here.

301
00:33:06,763 --> 00:33:08,628
It was the first time...

302
00:33:08,932 --> 00:33:10,627
we'd had a row,...

303
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:12,826
and then the transfer.

304
00:33:14,904 --> 00:33:18,601
I don't know about you,
but I wasn't allowed to go home.

305
00:33:23,113 --> 00:33:24,910
I couldn't say goodbye...

306
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:26,709
or give her a kiss.

307
00:33:28,018 --> 00:33:30,486
Or kiss my folks.

308
00:33:31,788 --> 00:33:33,619
Or pick up a toothbrush.

309
00:33:33,757 --> 00:33:36,089
"One phone call", they said.

310
00:33:38,028 --> 00:33:39,893
So I called her.

311
00:33:40,196 --> 00:33:41,561
"Hello."

312
00:33:41,698 --> 00:33:45,225
She recognized my voice
and hung up.

313
00:33:48,905 --> 00:33:51,465
"One phone call, soldier."

314
00:33:51,608 --> 00:33:54,042
That was my farewell.

315
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:57,538
But at least she wrote to you.

316
00:33:58,314 --> 00:34:00,214
Yeah, she did.

317
00:34:18,968 --> 00:34:20,492
This is Marta.

318
00:34:20,637 --> 00:34:21,899
She's pretty.

319
00:34:22,572 --> 00:34:25,700
Watch it.
-He'll wipe your eye.

320
00:34:32,248 --> 00:34:34,239
As the bitch doesn't write

321
00:34:35,552 --> 00:34:37,645
I keep thinking.

322
00:34:38,321 --> 00:34:41,484
She's got some other jerk.
-Don't be stupid.

323
00:34:41,624 --> 00:34:43,888
Otherwise, she'd have written.

324
00:34:46,362 --> 00:34:49,490
Maybe when I get home,...

325
00:34:49,632 --> 00:34:52,863
I'll open the door and see her
in my bed with another guy.

326
00:34:53,002 --> 00:34:55,937
I'll have to beat her up,
kill her.

327
00:34:56,339 --> 00:35:00,002
You'd do that too.
You'd kill her, wouldn't you?

328
00:35:44,354 --> 00:35:45,616
Hey...

329
00:35:46,122 --> 00:35:49,922
I'm getting rid of the sheep.
If they find it, we're in shit.

330
00:35:50,126 --> 00:35:51,593
Let me go.

331
00:35:53,062 --> 00:35:55,826
I found a place near the barrels.

332
00:35:55,965 --> 00:35:59,059
What barrels?
-The ones by the road.

333
00:36:00,236 --> 00:36:02,670
Nobody'll find it there.
-Be careful.

334
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:18,888
I'm not so sure
that's the best place.

335
00:36:29,165 --> 00:36:30,530
Halt!

336
00:36:32,268 --> 00:36:35,237
Why have you left your post?

337
00:36:35,939 --> 00:36:37,566
Answer me!

338
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:41,836
Why are you endangering
your companions' lives?

339
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:48,510
You thieving shit!

340
00:36:49,118 --> 00:36:51,313
You should be shot!

341
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:58,953
Do you know what we do
with thieves here?

342
00:36:59,095 --> 00:37:00,528
Do you?

343
00:37:01,898 --> 00:37:03,923
We've told you 1000 times.

344
00:37:04,067 --> 00:37:06,058
But you can't get it
into your head.

345
00:37:06,202 --> 00:37:07,692
Grunt!

346
00:37:07,837 --> 00:37:08,929
Turd!

347
00:37:11,307 --> 00:37:12,797
Get up!

348
00:37:21,851 --> 00:37:24,581
Attention!
Stand to attention!

349
00:37:27,323 --> 00:37:29,917
Move, on the double.

350
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:31,924
Get up!

351
00:37:32,295 --> 00:37:34,160
Move, on the double!

352
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,794
Get over here!

353
00:37:36,933 --> 00:37:40,027
On your hunkers, and jump!

354
00:37:41,537 --> 00:37:43,528
Get down on all fours!

355
00:37:43,973 --> 00:37:46,965
A snake, I want to see a snake.

356
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:50,008
Crawl like a snake.

357
00:37:50,146 --> 00:37:51,909
Permission, sergeant.

358
00:37:52,148 --> 00:37:54,708
What the hell is up with you two?

359
00:37:58,021 --> 00:37:59,989
It was the three of us.

360
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:03,553
We killed it
because we were hungry.

361
00:38:04,627 --> 00:38:06,458
Down on the ground.

362
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:13,199
I want you on all fours.

363
00:38:13,503 --> 00:38:15,903
You... Kneel down.

364
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:18,536
Look at me.

365
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,580
You don't know me.

366
00:38:25,815 --> 00:38:31,253
You know how many pretty boys
like you I've wiped out?

367
00:38:31,554 --> 00:38:35,285
You know how many?
-No, sergeant.

368
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:38,187
Look at me.

369
00:38:38,328 --> 00:38:42,264
So pray that I don't accidentally
fire a shot some night.

370
00:38:42,532 --> 00:38:44,830
Understand?
-Yes, sir.

371
00:38:45,034 --> 00:38:46,296
Pray!

372
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,498
Got that?
-Yes, sir!

373
00:38:51,908 --> 00:38:54,741
But this turd is the loser now.

374
00:38:59,148 --> 00:39:03,448
I want you to crawl slowly
back to your holes. Move!

375
00:39:14,597 --> 00:39:15,859
And you, turd...

376
00:39:15,998 --> 00:39:19,832
Get that animal you stole,
we're going to see Lt. Gilbert.

377
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:21,027
Move, move!

378
00:39:26,743 --> 00:39:27,869
Come on.

379
00:39:28,077 --> 00:39:30,272
Come on, grunt, move.

380
00:40:58,568 --> 00:41:02,060
What he said was that
there was an improvement.

381
00:41:02,305 --> 00:41:04,603
You saw what the doctor
was like.

382
00:41:06,943 --> 00:41:08,911
Can this be happening?

383
00:41:09,045 --> 00:41:11,536
I'm sure he'll pull through.

384
00:41:11,681 --> 00:41:15,117
Really?
-Yes, of course.

385
00:41:15,251 --> 00:41:19,415
The hospital wants some papers
that are in his apartment.

386
00:41:19,555 --> 00:41:22,752
I don't want to go on my own.
Would you come with me?

387
00:42:27,123 --> 00:42:29,717
I'd come to pick up some things.

388
00:42:30,126 --> 00:42:31,718
Luckily I had a key,...

389
00:42:31,861 --> 00:42:34,830
so I came in
and I found him here.

390
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,900
Just like he is now.

391
00:42:46,075 --> 00:42:49,442
I had to dump a few things
to avoid problems with the cops.

392
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:51,240
He took a whole mixture.

393
00:42:51,981 --> 00:42:53,744
He always did,...

394
00:42:55,818 --> 00:42:58,753
but this time
he put in everything.

395
00:42:59,255 --> 00:43:01,519
You weren't living here?

396
00:43:17,273 --> 00:43:19,070
I put up with everything.

397
00:43:19,275 --> 00:43:20,902
With everything.

398
00:43:23,846 --> 00:43:27,441
His bad spells,
not having any money...

399
00:43:28,184 --> 00:43:31,483
When he became an activist
with the veterans,...

400
00:43:31,821 --> 00:43:33,721
when he fought with them.

401
00:43:38,694 --> 00:43:40,662
I put up with it all.

402
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:45,033
When he drank,...

403
00:43:46,702 --> 00:43:49,500
when he drove me crazy
with his jealousy,...

404
00:43:52,642 --> 00:43:55,839
when he'd kick me around
when he came home drunk...

405
00:43:56,512 --> 00:43:57,945
Everything.

406
00:44:00,816 --> 00:44:02,784
Not having children.

407
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,222
You know,...

408
00:44:13,596 --> 00:44:15,029
the two...

409
00:44:15,297 --> 00:44:18,130
or three times
we talked after the war,...

410
00:44:19,068 --> 00:44:21,536
he always said the same thing.

411
00:44:22,805 --> 00:44:25,205
We had to go back
to the Islands.

412
00:44:25,775 --> 00:44:27,242
"We have to go back."

413
00:44:28,744 --> 00:44:30,644
"We have to go back."

414
00:45:25,935 --> 00:45:28,460
Fuck, you should've said
it was you.

415
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:32,233
I'll blow you away
the next time, motherfucker.

416
00:45:35,778 --> 00:45:37,109
Asshole!

417
00:45:39,982 --> 00:45:41,745
Any word of Vargas?

418
00:45:44,353 --> 00:45:46,913
They brought him to the hole
a while ago.

419
00:45:49,692 --> 00:45:51,956
They fucked him over.

420
00:45:53,929 --> 00:45:55,191
How is he now?

421
00:45:55,798 --> 00:45:57,561
He's a wreck.

422
00:45:58,567 --> 00:46:00,057
Soaking wet.

423
00:46:05,841 --> 00:46:07,706
I'm scared today.

424
00:46:11,714 --> 00:46:14,080
Scared the English will come.

425
00:46:15,818 --> 00:46:18,514
I keep seeing ships in the mist.

426
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:29,254
When I was a kid,...

427
00:46:30,065 --> 00:46:32,795
my dad would take me hunting.

428
00:46:33,803 --> 00:46:35,998
I was afraid of the dark,...

429
00:46:36,672 --> 00:46:41,132
so he taught me to listen
to what I couldn't see.

430
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,645
"When you can't see, listen",
he told me.

431
00:46:48,617 --> 00:46:50,642
It's the same with the English.

432
00:46:53,088 --> 00:46:55,579
You're either afraid or not.

433
00:47:00,763 --> 00:47:03,527
I stopped being afraid
of the dark long ago.

434
00:47:07,903 --> 00:47:11,669
When my son is older
I'll teach it to him.

435
00:47:12,575 --> 00:47:14,236
You've got a son?

436
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:17,839
Yes.

437
00:47:18,948 --> 00:47:21,075
Why did you never tell us?

438
00:47:26,255 --> 00:47:29,622
He's 18 months,
and he's beautiful.

439
00:47:31,026 --> 00:47:34,689
He looks at you with these
big eyes, he's like an owl.

440
00:47:37,867 --> 00:47:40,301
When the sergeant caught us
the other day,...

441
00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:42,161
and they took Vargas,...

442
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:46,166
I don't know
if it was from fear,...

443
00:47:47,877 --> 00:47:49,936
but I dreamed about him.

444
00:47:51,013 --> 00:47:52,503
What did you dream?

445
00:47:54,884 --> 00:47:56,943
He was watching me and laughing.

446
00:48:01,123 --> 00:48:03,250
I want to teach him things.

447
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,827
I don't know,
to play the guitar,...

448
00:48:08,297 --> 00:48:10,788
not to be afraid of the dark,...

449
00:48:13,736 --> 00:48:15,203
walk him to school.

450
00:48:18,741 --> 00:48:20,834
I'm afraid I won't see him again.

451
00:48:20,976 --> 00:48:22,705
You'll see him again.

452
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:10,958
Attention!

453
00:49:17,266 --> 00:49:20,099
You are under
the lieutenant's orders.

454
00:49:20,602 --> 00:49:22,160
Get ready, men.

455
00:49:22,304 --> 00:49:25,000
You have a mission
at the battlefront.

456
00:49:25,174 --> 00:49:28,007
You have to take this equipment
to Sgt. Garrido.

457
00:49:28,777 --> 00:49:30,870
You heard the lieutenant.

458
00:49:32,815 --> 00:49:34,874
Prepare your weapons,...

459
00:49:35,284 --> 00:49:38,685
your blanket, rain cape,
mess kit.

460
00:49:40,155 --> 00:49:42,885
I want you ready in five minutes.

461
00:49:44,994 --> 00:49:48,623
Do it in orderly fashion.
On the double! On the double!

462
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:03,811
Permission, Sgt. Gilbert.
-What is it, corporal?

463
00:50:03,946 --> 00:50:07,438
I think the equipment
is too heavy for two men.

464
00:50:07,583 --> 00:50:09,608
Do you?
-Yes, sir.

465
00:50:09,752 --> 00:50:11,014
OK, send the three of them.

466
00:50:11,153 --> 00:50:12,620
Yes, sir.

467
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:17,452
Vargas too?
-Affirmative.

468
00:50:17,593 --> 00:50:18,924
Vargas too.

469
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,226
Vargas!

470
00:50:26,502 --> 00:50:29,062
Get your gear,
you're going to the front too.

471
00:50:29,204 --> 00:50:32,002
I can't move, I'm sick.

472
00:50:32,141 --> 00:50:35,542
Leave your post
and come out here immediately.

473
00:50:35,677 --> 00:50:37,008
I said, now!

474
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,946
What is it?
You want to be staked out again?

475
00:50:47,289 --> 00:50:49,723
Come on, get out of there.

476
00:50:49,858 --> 00:50:50,984
Get out.

477
00:50:52,194 --> 00:50:53,593
Move.

478
00:50:54,797 --> 00:50:58,062
Attention. Attention!

479
00:50:59,234 --> 00:51:00,667
Attention!

480
00:51:01,804 --> 00:51:02,998
What's wrong?

481
00:51:03,872 --> 00:51:05,237
You wimp!

482
00:51:07,576 --> 00:51:09,100
Are you crying?

483
00:51:10,279 --> 00:51:12,645
Are you crying, soldier?
Answer me!

484
00:51:13,849 --> 00:51:15,180
What's wrong?

485
00:51:15,784 --> 00:51:18,651
You want to break my heart
with your tears?

486
00:51:20,889 --> 00:51:24,552
Your mommy's not here,
there's no one to look after you.

487
00:51:24,693 --> 00:51:26,627
You're on your own!

488
00:51:26,762 --> 00:51:28,821
Now, get your stuff.

489
00:51:28,964 --> 00:51:32,525
You're going out again
with those two grunts.

490
00:51:33,035 --> 00:51:34,627
Get ready to leave.

491
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:37,500
And you two mules,
what are you doing in there?

492
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:39,163
Get out here!

493
00:51:40,008 --> 00:51:42,602
Come on, ladies,
I don't have all day.

494
00:51:42,744 --> 00:51:44,974
Move those tits, come on!

495
00:51:47,316 --> 00:51:48,647
You two,

496
00:51:48,784 --> 00:51:50,775
get that stuff over there.

497
00:51:50,919 --> 00:51:53,683
Come on, move, move!

498
00:51:55,991 --> 00:51:58,551
Now, listen carefully to this.

499
00:52:00,762 --> 00:52:03,094
You're taking this stuff
to the front,...

500
00:52:03,932 --> 00:52:05,695
to the first lines,...

501
00:52:07,136 --> 00:52:09,661
where the real fighting is.

502
00:52:10,205 --> 00:52:12,230
You're going to find
real soldiers there...

503
00:52:12,508 --> 00:52:15,102
who are giving their lives
for their homeland,...

504
00:52:16,011 --> 00:52:19,742
not faggots like you.
Chicken shits! Apes!

505
00:52:20,782 --> 00:52:22,773
Now, move your asses!

506
00:53:10,265 --> 00:53:12,233
I can't go on!
-Come on.

507
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:20,166
Come on.

508
00:53:26,248 --> 00:53:32,016
You can't come this way!
Go around the other side!

509
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:37,816
It's all mined.

510
00:53:58,815 --> 00:54:00,407
Crazy fool!

511
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,483
Since I've seen you,
I keep going back there.

512
00:54:10,393 --> 00:54:12,793
Awake or asleep.

513
00:54:15,165 --> 00:54:17,531
As if the ghosts I've tried
to bury all these years...

514
00:54:17,801 --> 00:54:22,261
were all knocking at my door.

515
00:54:24,941 --> 00:54:27,341
I can see them, smell them.

516
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:37,587
Come on, wake up.

517
00:54:41,158 --> 00:54:43,456
We have to go back
to the Islands.

518
00:54:44,594 --> 00:54:47,825
Remember when you talked
about closure?

519
00:54:50,333 --> 00:54:52,301
Well, now's the time.

520
00:54:54,337 --> 00:54:56,498
Or the ghosts will always be there.

521
00:54:58,108 --> 00:54:59,973
Can you hear me?

522
00:57:18,882 --> 00:57:21,180
Move forward!

523
00:57:21,851 --> 00:57:23,148
Attack!

524
00:57:23,286 --> 00:57:24,753
For the homeland!

525
00:57:58,989 --> 00:58:01,082
Pull back!
Pull back, men!

526
00:58:01,224 --> 00:58:02,350
Retreat!

527
00:58:02,492 --> 00:58:04,960
Pull back, men!

528
00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:22,967
Mom! Help me, mommy!

529
00:58:23,279 --> 00:58:24,803
Mom!

530
00:58:25,281 --> 00:58:27,181
Don't leave me!

531
00:59:21,971 --> 00:59:23,165
Pull back!

532
00:59:25,842 --> 00:59:28,538
Retreat!
Pull back, for crissake!

533
00:59:32,949 --> 00:59:36,077
Move it!
Come on, pull back!

534
01:01:08,945 --> 01:01:10,708
Let's get out of here!

535
01:01:10,847 --> 01:01:12,178
Come on!

536
01:01:22,158 --> 01:01:23,887
Pull back!

537
01:01:25,361 --> 01:01:26,521
Help me!

538
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:33,158
Look at me, Juan!

539
01:01:33,303 --> 01:01:35,203
Look at me!

540
01:01:36,072 --> 01:01:37,835
Stop it, stop it, look at me!

541
01:01:37,974 --> 01:01:43,105
Chamorro, look at me, come on!
Stop, stop, for God's sake!

542
01:01:43,913 --> 01:01:46,381
Chamorro, look at me!

543
01:01:47,016 --> 01:01:50,508
Stop, no!

544
01:01:51,221 --> 01:01:58,093
Stop, stop, no!

545
01:02:16,846 --> 01:02:21,783
Don't leave me here.
Esteban!

546
01:02:33,463 --> 01:02:35,260
Don't leave me here.

547
01:02:36,165 --> 01:02:37,757
Where are you?

548
01:02:38,001 --> 01:02:39,366
Where are you?

549
01:02:39,836 --> 01:02:45,331
Esteban, look what they did to me!

550
01:02:46,843 --> 01:02:50,244
Where's Juan? Where's Juan?
-We have to move!

551
01:04:17,533 --> 01:04:20,764
Stop! Stop!

552
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:23,461
Stop it, you bastards!

553
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:27,534
Stop!

554
01:04:30,413 --> 01:04:33,143
Stop! Stop!

555
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:07,281
Esteban, are you there?

556
01:05:07,417 --> 01:05:10,181
What is it?
-Sgt. Pizarro wants to see you!

557
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,480
What does that fucker want?
What's up?

558
01:05:16,459 --> 01:05:20,418
We're pulling back to Puerto
Argentino, so go see Pizarro.

559
01:05:20,563 --> 01:05:21,825
Coming!

560
01:05:22,298 --> 01:05:25,131
Stay here. I'll see Pizarro
and come back for you.

561
01:05:39,816 --> 01:05:43,377
Report immediately to Lt. Gilbert!

562
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:49,982
Yes, sir?

563
01:05:50,827 --> 01:05:53,261
Pack my personal belongings,
quickly.

564
01:06:03,773 --> 01:06:05,297
Any further news?
-Nothing.

565
01:06:05,441 --> 01:06:07,136
Keep trying.

566
01:06:44,447 --> 01:06:45,812
Ready, sir.

567
01:06:45,948 --> 01:06:48,075
The cassette player!

568
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:55,353
Ready, sir!

569
01:06:55,558 --> 01:06:57,924
Take the bag to where I tell you.

570
01:06:58,060 --> 01:06:59,220
Quickly.

571
01:07:02,064 --> 01:07:03,258
No, you take it.

572
01:07:03,399 --> 01:07:04,525
What?

573
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,961
I have to help a wounded comrade.

574
01:07:07,103 --> 01:07:09,901
Get over here!
Who do you think you are?

575
01:07:10,039 --> 01:07:11,836
Are you refusing
to obey an order?

576
01:07:11,974 --> 01:07:13,965
We're losing because
of faggots like you!

577
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:16,271
No, it's because
you're all incompetent!

578
01:07:16,412 --> 01:07:17,743
What did you say?
-You heard!

579
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,279
What did you say?

580
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:22,881
Get over here or...
-Will you stake me out?

581
01:07:23,019 --> 01:07:24,213
Come here!

582
01:07:44,073 --> 01:07:45,301
Come on, pal.

583
01:07:45,441 --> 01:07:48,877
Wait, I have to help Vargas.
He's still in the hole.

584
01:07:49,011 --> 01:07:51,343
Come on, hurry up!

585
01:08:28,884 --> 01:08:30,010
Vargas!

586
01:08:35,157 --> 01:08:38,456
Vargas!

587
01:08:39,328 --> 01:08:40,727
He's up ahead!

588
01:08:40,863 --> 01:08:42,057
Vargas!

589
01:09:45,094 --> 01:09:46,561
Vargas!

590
01:10:03,212 --> 01:10:06,841
Come on, get up.
-I can't.

591
01:10:06,982 --> 01:10:09,177
Help me,
I can't do it on my own.

592
01:10:09,318 --> 01:10:11,878
I'm staying here,
save yourself.

593
01:10:12,021 --> 01:10:13,989
I can't move my leg.

594
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:17,120
It hurts a lot.
I can't walk any farther.

595
01:10:17,259 --> 01:10:19,318
We have to go to Puerto Argentino.

596
01:10:19,462 --> 01:10:21,453
It hurts so much.

597
01:10:22,531 --> 01:10:24,362
I'll never get out of here.

598
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,865
Come on!

599
01:10:31,107 --> 01:10:32,836
Come on, men!

600
01:10:33,109 --> 01:10:35,236
Gather in front of
the governor's house.

601
01:10:35,377 --> 01:10:37,845
We're entering Puerto Argentino.

602
01:10:38,848 --> 01:10:41,248
The enemy
could be hiding anywhere!

603
01:10:41,383 --> 01:10:43,408
There may be urban combat.

604
01:10:44,253 --> 01:10:47,245
The enemy could be hiding
in Puerto Argentino.

605
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:49,390
There may be urban combat.

606
01:10:49,525 --> 01:10:51,425
Gather up, on the double!

607
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:55,155
Come on, men.
Hurry!

608
01:10:57,133 --> 01:10:58,760
Come here, soldier!

609
01:11:00,102 --> 01:11:02,832
Come on, soldier, help this man!

610
01:11:03,105 --> 01:11:05,505
Come on, soldiers!

611
01:11:05,941 --> 01:11:08,808
Gather at the governor's house!

612
01:11:08,944 --> 01:11:12,380
Keep your eyes open.
The enemy could be waiting for us.

613
01:11:12,515 --> 01:11:14,779
There may be urban combat.

614
01:11:15,918 --> 01:11:19,354
We're entering Puerto Argentino,
the enemy may be waiting for us!

615
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:36,801
To the governor's house.

616
01:11:38,274 --> 01:11:41,766
Keep together, we're going
to the governor's house.

617
01:11:41,977 --> 01:11:43,740
Keep together!

618
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:47,141
Head for the governor's house.

619
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:50,144
Private Leguizamon!

620
01:11:50,519 --> 01:11:51,781
Come here.

621
01:11:51,921 --> 01:11:54,549
Listen, you're to go
to the governor's house.

622
01:11:54,824 --> 01:11:57,759
We have to take him
to the infirmary.

623
01:11:59,395 --> 01:12:01,124
Soldier!

624
01:12:01,263 --> 01:12:02,525
Come here.

625
01:12:03,432 --> 01:12:05,696
Help Leguizamon.

626
01:12:07,303 --> 01:12:10,739
Leguizamon, come back afterwards!

627
01:12:30,092 --> 01:12:32,822
Bring him over here.

628
01:12:32,962 --> 01:12:34,793
Careful!

629
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:43,295
When was it?
-Yesterday.

630
01:12:48,143 --> 01:12:50,270
Take it easy!

631
01:12:52,147 --> 01:12:54,377
It really hurts.
-Take it easy.

632
01:12:58,187 --> 01:13:00,883
You brought him in too late.

633
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:03,451
They're going to cut off my leg!

634
01:13:03,726 --> 01:13:07,287
They're going to cut it off!
-No, they're not!

635
01:13:07,429 --> 01:13:11,490
Don't believe that doctor!
I'm fine, I'm going home!

636
01:13:11,901 --> 01:13:14,199
Who are you?
-A friend, I brought him in.

637
01:13:14,336 --> 01:13:16,668
Well, you can go now.
-No, I'm staying.

638
01:13:16,805 --> 01:13:19,296
Get out of here.
-No, don't go, Esteban!

639
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:27,153
Quit pretending you're Maradona.
Pass it.

640
01:16:28,597 --> 01:16:31,191
Give me the helmets
for the goalposts.

641
01:16:50,352 --> 01:16:52,445
Come on, Maradona, pass it.

642
01:17:16,411 --> 01:17:18,504
Goal!

643
01:17:31,593 --> 01:17:32,992
Soldiers,...

644
01:17:34,196 --> 01:17:38,895
I regret that I have to make
this announcement,...

645
01:17:40,569 --> 01:17:42,799
but it is my duty...

646
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:45,529
to inform you...

647
01:17:45,974 --> 01:17:50,502
that a ceasefire has been ordered
on the entire island.

648
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,378
From this moment,...

649
01:17:55,984 --> 01:17:59,943
we are under the orders
of the British commanders.

650
01:18:02,057 --> 01:18:05,049
We are going to remain
at our positions...

651
01:18:05,294 --> 01:18:07,489
until our troops...

652
01:18:07,863 --> 01:18:09,956
are regrouped.

653
01:18:11,366 --> 01:18:13,334
At 13:00,...

654
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:18,331
you will see a helicopter
with a white flag.

655
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:22,234
Do not open fire.

656
01:18:30,419 --> 01:18:32,046
You men...

657
01:18:33,889 --> 01:18:36,858
have fought like true soldiers...

658
01:18:39,428 --> 01:18:41,919
and you will be remembered...

659
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,025
by all the Argentineans...

660
01:18:48,904 --> 01:18:50,371
as heroes.

661
01:18:53,909 --> 01:18:56,434
You can be sure of this.

662
01:18:56,578 --> 01:19:00,139
You gave all you had...

663
01:19:00,449 --> 01:19:02,781
to defend our homeland.

664
01:19:03,752 --> 01:19:05,117
Soon...

665
01:19:05,854 --> 01:19:08,152
you will be back
on the mainland.

666
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:12,055
You will be reunited
with your families.

667
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:15,228
But what
you have experienced here...

668
01:19:15,897 --> 01:19:18,365
will be with you...

669
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:19,762
forever.

670
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:06,947
Despite our efforts,...

671
01:20:07,449 --> 01:20:09,314
the bravery of some,...

672
01:20:10,052 --> 01:20:12,418
and the courage of our pilots...

673
01:20:12,954 --> 01:20:16,515
who flew low
over the English ships,...

674
01:20:18,093 --> 01:20:19,958
the improvisation, sadism...

675
01:20:20,095 --> 01:20:23,428
and treachery of those who had
tortured their own people...

676
01:20:24,132 --> 01:20:26,327
had led us to defeat.

677
01:20:28,437 --> 01:20:31,201
The English didn't need to use
the nuclear weapons...

678
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:33,433
that were on their ships.

679
01:20:34,376 --> 01:20:37,106
The support of NATO
and aid from the U.S.A...

680
01:20:37,245 --> 01:20:41,011
helped them seize a territory
that wasn't theirs.

681
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:44,885
They took our Islands again...

682
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,080
and rejoiced over our blood.

683
01:20:50,225 --> 01:20:54,889
We buried our dead and, defeated,
returned to the mainland.

684
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:58,794
Our officers hid us
in the barracks.

685
01:20:59,868 --> 01:21:02,336
We were forced to stay silent.

686
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:06,336
Why not talk about the Malvinas?

687
01:21:07,909 --> 01:21:10,139
Who thought we were heroes?

688
01:21:11,747 --> 01:21:14,079
Who hailed our homecoming?

689
01:21:14,983 --> 01:21:17,008
Our return to life?

690
01:21:19,221 --> 01:21:22,247
When I got home
I was expecting banners,...

691
01:21:23,291 --> 01:21:26,783
people welcoming us
with hugs and tears.

692
01:21:28,797 --> 01:21:31,732
A dog was barking
in the empty night,...

693
01:21:32,901 --> 01:21:34,892
and at the end of the street...

694
01:21:35,871 --> 01:21:38,806
only my mother was waiting
with open arms.

695
01:21:46,014 --> 01:21:47,379
Doctor!

696
01:21:48,383 --> 01:21:51,375
Doctor!
-Calm down, ma'am.

697
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,317
Nurse, take her outside.

698
01:21:53,455 --> 01:21:54,513
Come on.

699
01:21:54,956 --> 01:21:58,983
He's in ventricular tachycardia.
-Start C.P.R.

700
01:22:00,262 --> 01:22:01,490
Go!

701
01:22:01,863 --> 01:22:03,421
Right, let's go!

702
01:22:04,132 --> 01:22:05,724
Right, once again.

703
01:22:14,876 --> 01:22:16,867
What'll we do?
-Nothing, that's it.

704
01:22:17,012 --> 01:22:18,343
Nothing else?

705
01:22:19,781 --> 01:22:22,477
Will I turn off the ventilator?
-Go ahead.

706
01:22:35,797 --> 01:22:38,061
I'm so glad I called you.

707
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,997
You really helped me.

708
01:22:41,837 --> 01:22:44,032
You helped me too, Marta.

709
01:22:44,172 --> 01:22:45,434
Honestly.

710
01:22:58,987 --> 01:23:01,512
He wore it to the very end.

711
01:23:05,527 --> 01:23:09,054
Take it with you when
you go back to the Islands.

712
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,891
Leave it in the Malvinas.

713
01:23:33,021 --> 01:23:38,391
We shall shortly be landing
at the Falklands/Malvinas airport.

714
01:23:38,527 --> 01:23:41,360
We have now entered
a military area.

715
01:23:41,496 --> 01:23:45,023
The use of cameras
is strictly forbidden.

716
01:23:45,166 --> 01:23:47,031
Thank you
for your cooperation.

717
01:23:57,012 --> 01:24:03,212
The sea is measured by waves

718
01:24:06,888 --> 01:24:11,882
The sky, by wings

719
01:24:15,463 --> 01:24:19,297
And we are measured

720
01:24:19,801 --> 01:24:23,532
by our tears

721
01:24:27,075 --> 01:24:33,139
The air rests on leaves

722
01:24:37,085 --> 01:24:41,988
Water, on eyes

723
01:24:45,594 --> 01:24:49,860
And we rest

724
01:24:49,998 --> 01:24:53,365
on nothing

725
01:24:57,172 --> 01:25:02,405
It seems that salts and suns

726
01:25:04,312 --> 01:25:08,214
we and nothing

727
01:25:59,234 --> 01:26:02,795
"Argentineans, you will be welcome
when you stop claiming sovereignty

728
01:26:02,937 --> 01:26:06,236
and accept our right
to self-determination".

729
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:25,817
The old loves that are gone

730
01:32:27,255 --> 01:32:31,157
the dreams of those who lost

731
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:35,388
all the promises that fade

732
01:32:36,998 --> 01:32:40,764
and those who fell in any war

733
01:32:42,103 --> 01:32:45,766
everything is stored
in our memory

734
01:32:47,008 --> 01:32:50,808
the dream of life and history

735
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:55,140
The deceit and complicity

736
01:32:56,984 --> 01:33:01,045
of the genocides
who are walking free

737
01:33:01,923 --> 01:33:05,324
the "Reprieve" and
the "Full Stop" law

738
01:33:06,527 --> 01:33:10,429
to the beasts from that hell

739
01:33:11,766 --> 01:33:15,463
everything is stored
in our memory

740
01:33:16,504 --> 01:33:20,065
the dream of life and history

741
01:33:21,275 --> 01:33:24,802
Memory awakens to wound

742
01:33:25,079 --> 01:33:29,880
the sleeping people
who will not let it live

743
01:33:30,251 --> 01:33:33,220
free as the wind

744
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:39,990
The missing who are sought

745
01:33:41,229 --> 01:33:45,256
along the paths of their origins

746
01:33:46,167 --> 01:33:49,967
the hunger and abundance
that come together

747
01:33:51,339 --> 01:33:55,002
cruelty and its painful memory

748
01:33:56,210 --> 01:33:59,976
everything is nailed
in our memory

749
01:34:00,882 --> 01:34:04,511
a thorn of life and history

750
01:34:05,887 --> 01:34:09,482
Two thousand could eat for a year

751
01:34:10,391 --> 01:34:14,487
on the cost of a military moment

752
01:34:15,997 --> 01:34:19,330
So many would cease to be slaves

753
01:34:20,902 --> 01:34:24,269
for the cost of a bomb
dropped in the sea

754
01:34:25,873 --> 01:34:29,502
Everything is nailed
in our memory

755
01:34:30,344 --> 01:34:34,212
a thorn of life and history

756
01:34:35,316 --> 01:34:38,979
Memory stabs until it draws blood

757
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:43,921
from the people who tie it down
and won't let it walk

758
01:34:44,258 --> 01:34:47,056
free as the wind

759
01:34:52,567 --> 01:34:55,058
To the conscripts who fought
in the Malvinas.

760
01:34:55,203 --> 01:34:58,263
To the dead of the Belgrano.
To those who fought with dignity.

761
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:18,857
I'm sitting here

762
01:35:18,993 --> 01:35:23,054
under the tiny sun

763
01:35:24,465 --> 01:35:30,404
the one that gave us
the eagle and also the sparrow

764
01:35:33,941 --> 01:35:37,240
What can you do with the silence

765
01:35:37,378 --> 01:35:42,042
when your head explodes?

766
01:35:43,184 --> 01:35:46,585
How can you stop the impotence

767
01:35:46,854 --> 01:35:50,085
of not being able to do anything?

768
01:35:50,224 --> 01:35:54,854
Why do you want
to kill your children?

769
01:35:54,996 --> 01:35:59,399
Your suffering will last for years

770
01:35:59,567 --> 01:36:04,095
Yesterday, for not loving
the homeland

771
01:36:04,238 --> 01:36:09,369
today, for loving it too much

772
01:36:12,313 --> 01:36:16,977
Old laws and genocides

773
01:36:17,118 --> 01:36:23,284
a bad omen for life

774
01:36:47,481 --> 01:36:51,110
With the light filled with shadows

775
01:36:51,252 --> 01:36:55,518
and with the sun
deep in suffering

776
01:36:56,924 --> 01:37:01,156
I went back home on my knees

777
01:37:01,295 --> 01:37:04,890
and left my dead friends here

778
01:37:08,469 --> 01:37:11,870
In a country that's sick

779
01:37:12,006 --> 01:37:16,841
all the cards are on the table

780
01:37:17,778 --> 01:37:21,179
We play perverted games

781
01:37:21,315 --> 01:37:24,512
between soccer and war

782
01:37:24,785 --> 01:37:28,949
Blood of glory,
hatred against love

783
01:37:29,323 --> 01:37:33,487
gods and beasts,
madness and pain

784
01:37:34,061 --> 01:37:38,760
I'll open the doors
of this emptiness

785
01:37:38,899 --> 01:37:43,893
because fate threw me upwards

786
01:37:46,974 --> 01:37:51,434
Old laws and genocides

787
01:37:51,579 --> 01:37:57,313
a bad omen for life

788
01:38:06,794 --> 01:38:11,288
I'll insist with a sea of roses

789
01:38:11,432 --> 01:38:15,960
and I'll build on ashes

790
01:38:16,137 --> 01:38:20,733
I'll have a new dream in my hands

791
01:38:20,875 --> 01:38:25,312
and I'll fight for justice
to be done

792
01:38:25,446 --> 01:38:30,008
My children's cheeks
against my lips

793
01:38:30,151 --> 01:38:35,020
And I'll find rest again
in their eyes

794
01:38:36,157 --> 01:38:40,560
Old laws and genocides

795
01:38:40,828 --> 01:38:46,198
a bad omen for life

796
01:38:54,842 --> 01:38:59,245
Old laws and genocides

797
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:04,784
a bad omen for life
