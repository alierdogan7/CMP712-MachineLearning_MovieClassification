1
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,920
<i>... and here a proclamation</i>
<i>from His Majesty, The King.</i>

2
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,800
<i>"Under these circumstances</i>
<i>for our fatherland -</i>

3
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,080
<i>- I urge all in the cities</i>
<i>and countryside -</i>

4
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,640
<i>- to keep a correct and</i>
<i>appropriate behaviour -</i>

5
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,040
<i>- because any unnecessary</i>
<i>action or statement -</i>

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,600
<i>- can have severe consequences.</i>

7
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,080
<i>God save all of You.</i>

8
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,080
<i>God save Denmark.</i>

9
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,080
<i>Christian Rex, Amalienborg,</i>
<i>the 9th of April, 1940."</i>

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,400
Early in the morning of April 9th 1940,
German troops pass the border
between Denmark and Germany.

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,400
The unprepared and badly equipped Danish
Army meets Europe's strongest military power.

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,400
The hardest battles
take place in Southern Jutland.

13
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,920
Sec. lieutenant, the lieutenant told me
to drive you to the training area.

14
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,400
There is a tense mood
at the barracks.

15
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,640
They have communicated with Copenhagen.
But nobody wants to talk.

16
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,800
I know just as little as you, sergeant.

17
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,040
Then she won't answer,
so I lean carefully towards her.

18
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,480
- You know what she says then?
No.

19
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,680
Hell, she doesn't wan't a soldier.

20
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,560
We need to speed up. We are in a hurry.

21
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,920
What have you done?
Worked with my father.

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,400
I haven't seen Ingrid as much.

23
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,240
You'll see her again soon.

24
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,200
- What about you, Gram?
- Yeah, What about me?

25
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,840
- So, what have you done?
Like you wan't to know.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,960
Then you can joke with it,
on my behalf.

27
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,720
- You always think the worst of me.
Yes.

28
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,800
Come on, Gram.
Please tell us.

29
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,600
If you really wan't to know.

30
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,160
I have just been home, at my folks place.
Gotten my clothes washed.

31
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,360
Read a book.

32
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,920
Sometimes I get really sad
on your behalf, Gram

33
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,600
Gram?

34
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,800
Why do you think,
our passes have been revoked?

35
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,080
You probably got the same answer.
It's a test alarming.

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,600
It is just a drill.

37
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,920
(Shots and talking in the background)

38
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,200
Second lieutenant.
Lieutenant.

39
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,080
Now we're here again.
Another round of the wolf is coming.

40
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,880
I thought that,
its probably not just a drill.

41
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,600
We received information about night shipments
of military equipment in Kiel.

42
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,480
A train with troops was seen going north,
towards the border.

43
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,720
That doesn't sound good.

44
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,240
The General Staff shares your worries,
all passes are revoked.

45
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,480
They have sent a motorcycle platoon down,
which we will be supporting.

46
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,680
Led by a sergeant Bundgaard.

47
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,800
225 with entourage, reporting.

48
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,960
You are late. Drop the bags, get weapons.
Join the shooting exercise.

49
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,200
The three privates.
Give them kitchen duty for the week.

50
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,600
Roger, lieutenant.
Kitchen duty for a week.

51
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
Perfect.

52
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,120
221, fire.

53
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,920
Good shot.

54
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,760
212, fire.

55
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,120
Try again.

56
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,800
212, concentrate.
We aren't here for the fun of it.

57
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,240
I don't know who I am most afraid of.
Lassen or the Germans.

58
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,200
I can't if you laugh at me.
You don't hit anything anyways.

59
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,760
Something to drink?

60
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,120
Coffee, thanks.
Cognac.

61
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,840
If you ask me,
the Germans are going to Norway.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,760
They wan't the Norwegian waters.
Denmark have no strategic value.

63
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,520
Our southern neighbors haven't
exactly been predictable.

64
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,640
Thank you.

65
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,200
You must be tired.
When did you wake up?

66
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,120
At three o'clock.

67
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,440
I tried to sneak out, but of course
i woke up the whole home.

68
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,520
Now, you didn't make your
wife unnecessarily worried?

69
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,000
I said nothing,
but my wife knows me too well.

70
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,720
It's not the first time the Germans move,
without anything happening.

71
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,480
Let's see.
We are ending the shooting exercise.

72
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,680
Next exercise are by the bikes.
Go to the bikes. Move!

73
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,040
- Hi, Gram.
Good to see you.

74
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,080
Are you better at hitting your targets?
Go to the bikes, faster!

75
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,040
Ready sergeant.
Ready sergeant.

76
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,880
Perfect, first exercise, change front tire.
Two minutes. Proceed!

77
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,680
You have them?
Yes.

78
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,720
Help here, come on!

79
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,920
Hand me the tire
Faster. Come on.

80
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,240
Hold it here.
Get that wheel back on.

81
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,800
Hold on. Up with it.
Screw those nuts back in.

82
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,280
Ready sergeant.
Ready sergeant.

83
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,720
Good.

84
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,000
Lieutenant.
Do it again.

85
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,720
Do it in under one and a half minute
Under one and a half? Roger.

86
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,000
Good. Again, this time under one,
and a half minute. Proceed!

87
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,320
What are you waiting for?

88
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,080
Come on, Lassen.
Faster!

89
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,880
One and a half minute...
He must have drunk from the piss pot.

90
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,640
Kolding, you wan't more of that bread?

91
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,200
Yes, Justesen. I wan't it.
Are there room for more?

92
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,800
Chill out. You shall not roll home.

93
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,880
Funny how big you are you Copenhageners,
when you are many.

94
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,560
But when you are alone...

95
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,200
...you become quiet as mice.

96
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,160
How long do you think,
we will continue, Gram?

97
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,120
Till we can do it in one and
a half minute.

98
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,960
We have tried.
It's not going happen.

99
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,360
The sec. lieutenant just wan't
to see us work hard.

100
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,760
The wife probably didn't give him
what he wanted.

101
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,880
It's your officer, you are talking about.

102
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,640
He can't hear me.

103
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,320
Unless you are going to tell on me,
mr. room chairman.

104
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,760
(Motor sound)

105
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,720
Lieutenant, I have an important message
from the lieutenant colonel.

106
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,360
Stop the drill and return to the barracks.

107
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,160
After a meal they must go to bed
in preparedness.

108
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,200
What has happened?
There is new intelligence information.

109
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,240
A German convoy...

110
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,040
...are moving towards the border,
it's said to be kilometers long.

111
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,840
The lieutenant colonel doesn't
want to cause panic... -

112
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,040
...and therefore it has to be mentioned
as a part of the drill.

113
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,480
Sergeant Klostergaard, cancel the meal!
We ride to the barracks.

114
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,440
You heard the lieutenant!
Stand up! Go to the bikes!

115
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,440
Stand at attention!

116
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,200
After this you will all receive
40 rounds and a first aid kit.

117
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,720
Next you will go to your rooms
and go to bed in preparedness.

118
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,640
You need to keep on the uniforms and boots.
The equipment has to be ready.

119
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,800
And from now on you have to wear
your dog tag at all times.

120
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,080
Turn right!

121
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
Initiate!

122
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,200
40 rounds each?

123
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,400
Do you still think it's
just a drill, Gram?

124
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,040
They deserve to know what's going on.

125
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,160
Yes. But it's not our decision to make,
second lieutenant.

126
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,720
(motor sounds, faint yelling)

127
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,560
(dog barking)

128
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,480
<i>Border station 3 here. Now there is massive</i>
<i>activity on the other side.</i>

129
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,440
<i>I repeat. Massive activity on the</i>
<i>German side. Can you hear me?</i>

130
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,720
Received.
Have the Germans crossed the border?

131
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,880
<i>No, it hasn't been crossed,</i>
<i>but we can hear massive activity.</i>

132
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,200
How many are they?
How many are we speaking of?

133
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,920
<i>It's hard to say. We can't see them,</i>
<i>we can only hear them.</i>

134
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,000
<i>What does the lieutenant colonel</i>
<i>want us to do?</i>

135
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,560
They must stay put,
till they get new orders.

136
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,600
Border station 3, stay put.
Stay calm and wait for new orders.

137
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,840
<i>Yes sir. Roger that.</i>
Padborg, Kruså and now Rens.

138
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,960
There are any longer no doubt
about what's happening.

139
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,680
Give me the chief
for the Jutland division again.

140
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,040
Haderslev and Sønderborg
are also in a state of alert.

141
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,640
They are awaiting clearance
to leave the barracks.

142
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,920
They are 50 kilometers away.
The first hour depends on us.

143
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,880
Lieutenant colonel?
The chief for the Jutland Division.

144
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,120
Cut the speaker.

145
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,080
Major general? We have clear indication
about increasing troop activity.

146
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,720
Requesting to send my troops
towards the border.

147
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,480
And let them go in defensive positions.

148
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm aware of that major general,
but we are 10 kilometers from the border.

149
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,520
If we wait till the border is crossed,
we won't have time to go into position.

150
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,000
Have the General Staff tried to talk
some sense to the minister?

151
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,200
Regarding the latest escalation
in consideration...

152
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,200
Yes sir, major general.

153
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,280
We will do our best.

154
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,040
So far, no news. We stay on high alert
at the moment.

155
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,680
It's the prime minister evaluation,
that any Danish mobilization...

156
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,800
...can be seen as a confrontation and
worsen the situation.

157
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,400
Defensive maneuvers are a provocation?
And the German mobilization is not?

158
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,240
Lieutenant, if you have a problem with
the order, keep it to yourself.

159
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,120
Men. Make sure your troops are
ready to go.

160
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,240
Yes sir, lieutenant colonel.

161
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,080
Sergent Klostergaard.
Yes sir.

162
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,000
Inspection of the sleeping hall.
Yes sir.

163
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,800
Shouldn't we already be in
defensive positions?

164
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:23,200
Yes. For that you can thank the
prime minister that we are not.

165
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,160
Can I see the picture?

166
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,240
Can I have it back?
Yes yes. Take it easy

167
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,880
There are not much we can do.

168
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,240
It's not everyone who shoot that well.
Come.

169
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,840
Hey Lassen. Getting any sleep?

170
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,320
Not so much.

171
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,400
Are you nervous, Lassen?
Yes.

172
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,160
It's not everyday you get
ammunition like this.

173
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,240
40 rounds each isn't much.
No it's not.

174
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,960
Can we have some of yours?

175
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,680
It's not for me. I have the machine gun.
It's for Lundgren.

176
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,000
I don't think,
we are allowed to do that, Andersen.

177
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,760
Lassen, you aren't exactly
the best shot here, right?

178
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,240
But Lundgren... We know what he
can do with a riffle.

179
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,120
Just half.
Exactly. 20 rounds.

180
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,640
It's for all our sakes.

181
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Ok.
Good.

182
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,760
Lassen, don't.
Don't do it.

183
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,520
We have received 40 rounds each.
No one should get more or less.

184
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,640
And you two should be in bed.
Yes sir, room chairman.

185
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,600
Lassen, I mean it.
Gram, it's okay.

186
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,840
It's fine by me.
Yeah, what's the problem?

187
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,640
It's not your decision to make,
and you know it.

188
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,080
Gram, don't you want to win?
Of course I want to win.

189
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,360
You are German, right? Maybe you are
not interested in a victory?

190
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,160
I'm proud to be able to
call myself Danish.

191
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,760
But you are not.
That's exactly what I am.

192
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,040
Your dad is German, correct?
Yeah.

193
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,080
Then you're German.
You are more stupid than I thought.

194
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,680
It's not a game.

195
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,360
Shouldn't we save some
strength over there?

196
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,200
Go back to sleep.
It's pretty hard when you're jabbering.

197
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,120
Nobody spoke to you, Justesen.

198
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,320
I mean it, Andersen.
Lay down, right now.

199
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,840
Or what?
Just go lay down in your bed.

200
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,840
What's going on here?
Attention!

201
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,440
You should have gone to bed prepared!

202
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,680
Then you look like this! I have other shit
to do, than keeping my eyes on you!

203
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,320
How hard is it to button a jacket?

204
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,400
You have buttoned it wrong!

205
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,680
225 you are room chairman. It's your
responsibility. Keep it together!

206
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,200
Sergent, yes sir!

207
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,280
Get those jackets buttoned.

208
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,040
223, finish your letter and get some rest.

209
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,840
Two minutes, then this hall
is totally quiet!

210
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,040
Proceed!

211
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,360
You need a light sec. lieutenant?
Looks like I do.

212
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,800
Are your men sleeping?
They are trying.

213
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,880
It's hard in full uniform.

214
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,320
I thought that order were
meant for everyone.

215
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,400
Except officers.

216
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,720
You are Bundgaard?
Yes.

217
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,440
It's my understanding that we
are supporting your platoon.

218
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,320
If the border is crossed.
When it gets crossed.

219
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,600
We are most likely the first to meet them.

220
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,480
Somebody is going to do it.

221
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,600
Can I?
Of course.

222
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,920
Then, eh... Pedal extra fast down there.

223
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,280
We're going to need you.
We'll be there.

224
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,080
We are faster than you think.

225
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,720
Keep the matches.
Thanks.

226
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,360
Sergent Bundgaard.
Second lieutenant.

227
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,160
If the Germans wanted to attack,
they'd had already done so.

228
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,320
There are somebody who are
negotiating as we speak.

229
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,720
Neither party wants a conflict.

230
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,160
(footsteps, door opens)

231
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,120
Something is happening in the radio room.

232
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,880
Border station 3, come again. Repeat.

233
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,080
<i>I repeat.</i>
<i>The German troops are moving.</i>

234
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,040
What can You see?

235
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,200
<i>We can see infantry and armored vehicles.</i>

236
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:17,040
<i>They are coming straight towards us.</i>
Have the Germans crossed the border?

237
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,600
Border station 3.

238
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,880
<i>They crossed it. We are being overrun.</i>
<i>What do...?</i>

239
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,400
Border station 3, repeat message.
Border station 3, come in.

240
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,520
You heard it yourselves.
The enemy has crossed the border.

241
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,040
Denmark is at war.

242
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,320
Gentlemen. Now is the time to
show what we are made of.

243
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,880
Alarm! Raise the alarm. Come on!
(a sirene starts)

244
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,360
To the bikes! Hurry up!

245
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,040
Here you go, Kolding.

246
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,720
Prepare to take off!
Sergent, yes sir!

247
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,400
Next.

248
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,400
Second lieutenant. 219, 4th company,
2nd platoon. Machine gun.

249
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,040
Next.

250
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,720
Second lieutenant. 223, 4th company,
2nd platoon, helper.

251
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,520
Next man.
217, 4th company, 2nd platoon.

252
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,120
Helper.
Next.

253
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,000
233 help with the tripod.
Yes sir.

254
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,040
Ready?
Yes sir!

255
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,480
217, are you ready? Are you ready, 212?
Sergent, yes sir!

256
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,280
Get that weapon higher up.
219, are you ready?

257
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,320
Sergent, yes sir!

258
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,520
The Germans have broken through 3 places.
One of them is Kruså

259
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,320
They are heading straight towards
us on highway 10.

260
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,320
If we hold it, it'll be hard
for the them to go north.

261
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,440
Any reports?

262
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,400
Haderslev and Sønderborg
should be on their way.

263
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,520
We need to stop the advancement
till reinforcements arrive.

264
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,000
When that happens we push them back.

265
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,040
Sønder Hostrup. New orders and
reports comes form here.

266
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,360
We meet up at Lundtoftebjerg.
You have to make stand meanwhile.

267
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,840
We will do our best lieutenant.
Lieutenant.

268
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,360
Attention!

269
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,840
Platoon ready for take off.
Roger, sergeant.

270
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,320
A German armor division have
crossed the border!

271
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,400
This is not a drill!
Denmark is at war!

272
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,400
Fight well!

273
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,320
Platoon, follow me!

274
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,520
Platoon! Get ready to mount up!

275
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,920
Mount up!

276
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,960
(Explosions and gunfire)

277
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,760
Faster!

278
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,760
Stop!
Stop! Dismount!

279
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,480
Be ready!

280
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,440
It's the motorcycle platoon.

281
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,400
Maybe it's over with?
I don't think so.

282
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,200
Stop!

283
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,680
Lieutenant, we only just
made it into positions.

284
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,160
We stopped a couple of armors.
We also got some infantry.

285
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,280
But it was too much.
How many are they?

286
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,640
One or two motorized companies
with assisting armor.

287
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,600
We are going north to setup
proper defense.

288
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,720
We got to hold Lundtoftebjerg.
Lundtoftebjerg has fallen.

289
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,200
Then we got to set up here. The terrain
is too open, come with us.

290
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,040
We need to hold Lundtoftebjerg till
Haderslev and Sønderborg gets here.

291
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,680
You haven't seen what's up ahead.
You can do what you want.

292
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,640
I will follow my orders.
There is no time for this.

293
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:10,240
Sand.
You have to talk to him.

294
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,680
I'm with him.
Take care second lieutenant.

295
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,000
Motorcycle platoon, we will continue.

296
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,920
What's happening?

297
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,760
Sergent Klostergaard!
Yes sir!

298
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,800
The machine guns are our best
chance against their armor.

299
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,800
We can split them in three and
catch them in crossfire.

300
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,280
How long till the reinforcements arrives?

301
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,400
At least 20 minutes.
Good.

302
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:14,000
Sand, get first squad in the tree line.
I'll take second squad down the gutter.

303
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,760
Third squad, on the hill. Machine gunners,
wait for my signal.

304
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,280
The carbines only shoot when
they see infantry getting close.

305
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,880
Yes sir!
Proceed!

306
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,800
First squad on me! Second squad wait
for the lieutenants orders!

307
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,400
Third squad, on me!

308
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,640
Second squad!

309
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:47,640
219, make emplacement by the tree!
212 support the machine gun!

310
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,840
Go 50 meters that way!

311
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,840
We take position here, 225!
Roger!

312
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,360
Here.

313
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,640
Nice place, 219.
We wait for the lieutenants orders.

314
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,840
Short, controlled bursts
against their armor.

315
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,400
Roger, second lieutenant.

316
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,520
Where did the motorcycle platoon go?

317
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,000
I need your full attention
on that road there.

318
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,280
Yes sir!

319
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,000
I am so hungry. I haven't even
gotten my coffee today

320
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,560
Is that all you think about?
I mean it, Gram.

321
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,200
I don't function without my
first cup of coffee.

322
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,840
You and your coffee.

323
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,560
233, take position. Only the machine guns
that shoots at the given signal.

324
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,280
The rest of you wait till
the infantry shows.

325
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,120
There is headwind.

326
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,680
It's sunrise.

327
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,160
Great conditions for hunting.
Shh, Kolding.

328
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,680
(motor sounds)

329
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,240
Wait.

330
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,080
Get down more, 225.
Roger.

331
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,720
Ready.

332
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,800
Ready

333
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,880
(whistle blows)

334
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,680
Open fire!
Open fire!

335
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,640
Andersen, they are ricocheting!
I know!

336
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,320
I need a new mag!

337
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,440
233, wait till the infantry shows.

338
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,840
(another whistle blows)
Open fire!

339
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,360
I'm reloading!

340
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,760
They are going for the machine gun!
225, cover right flank!

341
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,200
You too, 212!

342
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,280
Two armored vehicles to the
right of the road!

343
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,200
Roger that!

344
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
Need a new mag!

345
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,600
(motor sound)

346
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,120
Come on, 233!
On it, sec. lieutenant!

347
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,640
212, where are you?

348
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,160
I'm reloading!
233, come on. Cover the road!

349
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,440
Yes sir!

350
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,720
Second lieutenant, help us!

351
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,600
I'm pulling back!

352
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,640
We are pulling back!

353
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,720
Come on! Get back!
212, after them!

354
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,800
219, we are pulling back!

355
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,240
You hit it!
Hell, I got it!

356
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,920
Shoot them! Shoot them!
Shoot them, Kolding!

357
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Kolding, get down!

358
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,480
Nørreskov, help him!

359
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,040
Is it bad?
Yeah, it's bad!

360
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,360
We need help!

361
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,600
Nørreskov!

362
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,960
We are pulling back!

363
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:46,440
We got to get him away from here.
Kolding.

364
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,520
Second lieutenant, we got to go!
Kolding, look at me.

365
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,400
233, take the munitions bag!
Do it now, take those bags!

366
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,560
There is nothing more to do here!
We can't do anything else! Come on!

367
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,440
219, take the machine gun!
Leave the tripod!

368
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,200
Come on!

369
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,880
Andersen,
where is Kolding?

370
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,440
Where is Kolding?
Come on, follow me!

371
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,320
Where is Kolding?
Control yourself!

372
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,840
Tell me, where is he?
Kolding is dead! Follow me! Get moving!

373
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,280
Come on!

374
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,880
Get moving.
Nørreskov!

375
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,720
This way!

376
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,720
Down to the farm house there.

377
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,320
212, get all the bikes in the shed.
Yes sir.

378
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,000
Come on. Move it.

379
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,440
(faint motor sounds)

380
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,680
Come on, 212.

381
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,120
Get in.

382
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,600
219, take the window here.

383
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,000
223, take that window over there.

384
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,640
225, take that window there.
Roger.

385
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,600
Give me that weapon.
(he's crying)

386
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,800
Get your shit together,
so we can get out alive.

387
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,640
Here! If you sees anything...
What are you doing?

388
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,040
No!
Relax! Relax!

389
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,640
Get down on the floor ma'am, now! Down!
O...h no.

390
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,120
(she's weeping)
Ma'am, stay calm.

391
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,040
We are not here very long.
Okay.

392
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,800
(faint weapon fire)

393
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,080
(weeping)

394
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,280
219, anyone there?

395
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,040
I can't see anyone.

396
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,560
Still nothing?
No.

397
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,160
I don't think anyone will come.

398
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,600
Sorry ma'am, do you have a place where the
soldier can get some water in his face?

399
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,800
Yes. This way.
223.

400
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,920
This one?
Yes.

401
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,680
Follow me.

402
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,360
225.

403
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:50,320
We will go north.
Up to Sønder Hostrup.

404
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,920
Get hold of the lieutenant colonel.
There is the command center.

405
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,120
There we can get new orders.
So we continue?

406
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,920
What else do you think, 233?

407
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,520
Nothing second lieutenant.
I'm ready.

408
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,560
225.

409
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,120
I need a second in command.

410
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,240
That is you.

411
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,880
219, return 233's weapon.

412
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,240
Come here.

413
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,520
There. Now you good to go.
Sweet boy.

414
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,880
There.

415
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,880
We are moving out.

416
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,680
We'll countinue.
Yes sir. Gentlemen.

417
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,520
Ma'am.
You can hide here.

418
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,200
You can have the hayloft.
Nobody will find you there.

419
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,560
And how would that help?
It would save the young boys life.

420
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,320
I'll protect the men with
everything I got.

421
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,600
I don't want to hide them,
as the war continues.

422
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:31,040
20 years ago this was Germany,
and now it's Denmark.

423
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,920
Maybe I should be ashamed, but it
never meant anything for me, really.

424
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,960
It means a lot for me.

425
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,440
Thank you for your help.

426
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,360
Attention!

427
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,400
I don't know what happened
to the lieutenant...

428
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,640
...sergeant Klostergaard
or the rest of the platoon.

429
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,200
We are, what's left. Now we know
what we're up against.

430
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,040
We have lost a good soldier today.

431
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,680
217.

432
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,800
He fought, but succumbed to gods will.

433
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:27,360
Let his death be a lesson to us all.
We all have to be alert.

434
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,440
After me.

435
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,600
(explosion in the distance)

436
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,600
2nd squad, 4th company.

437
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,400
Stop!

438
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:49,000
219, see if you can get some ammunition.
The rest, wait here.

439
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,840
There is still no contact.

440
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,520
Lieutenant colonel.
Second lieutenant.

441
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:01,160
Sønder Hostrup calling. Come in.
Come in. Can you hear me?

442
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,840
I repeat.
Sønder Hostrup here. Come in.

443
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,080
(radio static)

444
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:13,360
You were at Lundtoftebjerg?
Yes. We didn't hold the position so long.

445
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,520
They were too many. We were attacked
by both armor and infantry.

446
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,000
Where is your lieutenant?
I'm not sure.

447
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,240
I think,
the lieutenant was captured -

448
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,720
Or surrendered with the
rest of the platoon.

449
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,960
What about the motorcycle platoon?

450
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:34,720
Sergent Bundgaard moved north
to new a new position.

451
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,480
But we are not defeated.
We are ready for the next order.

452
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,840
Get the radio up in the truck.
Move it!

453
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,960
Are you leaving?

454
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,000
Walk with me.

455
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,480
Thank you.

456
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,360
Cigarette?
Yes, please.

457
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,880
We have information from
Haderslev and Sønderborg.

458
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:19,000
They are not coming, sec. lieutenant.
There will be no reinforcements?

459
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,360
But why?

460
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,040
They said that they could do
more where they were.

461
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,320
It was the last thing we heard before
all communications stopped.

462
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,240
The telephone lines have most likely
been sabotaged by the enemy.

463
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,200
What about the joint defensive line?
It's not going to happen down here.

464
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,880
The border areas are lost.
All units have pulled back...

465
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:52,920
...or surrendered, so the battle will
be moved further north.

466
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,920
Any news from Copenhagen?
No. We have no contact with them.

467
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,640
So what are your orders then,
lieutenant colonel?

468
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:14,320
We pull back to Haderslev,
and join the garrison.

469
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,200
Then there will be created a
new defensive line there.

470
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,480
It's going to be a long day, Sand.

471
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,520
Lieutenant colonel.
Second lieutenant.

472
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,280
Attention!

473
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,640
There are some news.

474
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,200
The reinforcements from
Haderslev aren't coming.

475
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,880
And not from Sønderborg either.

476
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,440
We need to get to Haderslev.

477
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:07,400
And assist the garrison in
protection of the town.

478
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,680
May I ask a question?

479
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:14,200
No, 233, you may not. We take a
shortcut through the forest.

480
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,680
We should reach Haderslev before the
Germans. Understood?

481
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,040
Roger, second lieutenant.
Follow me.

482
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,400
Second lieutenant?

483
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:57,200
Yes, 212.
I have a flat back tire.

484
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,880
We do a short stop here.
219, you help.

485
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,000
233, stand guard over there.
223, over there.

486
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,040
225, you are from the area, right?
Yes, second lieutenant.

487
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,840
The fastest way to Haderslev?
I want to stay off the main road.

488
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,080
And I don't want to be in the open.
What are you thinking?

489
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:28,920
If we continue the way we are
going to hit this road...

490
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,480
...and then we go through Aabenraa.

491
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,960
And from there, we can go
straight to Haderslev.

492
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,800
It should be doable.
Good, that's what we'll do.

493
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,680
Second lieutenant?
Yes.

494
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:48,880
223. Nørreskov. Kolding, 217.
They... he was a dear friend.

495
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,600
Make sure they hurry up.
Yes, second lieutenant.

496
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,240
212, 219.
You have to hurry up with that.

497
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,080
Proceed.

498
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,040
Did You have a great leave?

499
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,480
Yes, second lieutenant.
Do You have family?

500
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,520
I'm engaged.

501
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,240
Was that letter to her?
Yes.

502
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,040
Is the date set?

503
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:46,080
Not yet,
but hopefully this summer.

504
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,520
Then we must get You home again.

505
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,720
Nørreskov, You are a part
of 4th company, 2nd bicycle platoon.

506
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,600
You are not alone.

507
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,200
Received.

508
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,680
And the last bit. Come on.

509
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,880
We're almost there.
Do it faster.

510
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,320
Come on.
Give us a some more time.

511
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,680
I have no more time to give You.

512
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,120
The war is not waiting for You.
I can't do it any faster.

513
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,280
You have to.
Who the hell do you think you are?

514
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,520
Get going.
What?

515
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,920
What's the problem?
I'm trying...

516
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,040
Are you in any doubt?
No.

517
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,440
Have you forgotten your job?
No.

518
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,080
No, second lieutenant.
Then finish up that bike.

519
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,600
Yes sir.

520
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,280
Never discuss an order.
Yes, second lieutenant.

521
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:43,200
Ready, second lieutenant.
We'll continue. 233, 223.

522
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,680
2nd squad, 4th company.

523
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,320
Can you lend a hand?
223, 233, help them!

524
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,280
Follow me.

525
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,160
225, You go with me.

526
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,680
You stay here.
Yes sir.

527
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,440
Hello. Do you want to buy some cheap milk?
Only two kroner.

528
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,360
Hey, what are you doing here?

529
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,920
What to buy some cheap milk?
Only two kroner.

530
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,080
Sergent Bundgaard.
Yes.

531
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,640
What's going on?
Second lieutenant.

532
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:32,400
The plan was to set up positions here,
but the locals are flocking the area.

533
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:37,360
They refuse to leave.
How did Lundtoftebjerg go?

534
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,760
We didn't hold it very long.
Any losses?

535
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,240
One man. Kolding.

536
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,040
No reinforcements are coming.

537
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,280
Neither Haderslev or Sønderborg?
No.

538
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,280
What's the orders?
We set up defense in Haderslev.

539
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,560
A defensive line so far
inland has no effect.

540
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,160
That's the order.

541
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,960
I'm not sacrificing my
men in a pointless battle.

542
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:02,920
Gather your men and move to Haderslev.
Understood?

543
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,400
Are we clear?
Yes.

544
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,560
Can I see what You have there?
Yes.

545
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:15,960
How did You get this?
German planes dropped them all morning.

546
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:21,280
Second lieutenant. German planes
have dropped this all over this place.

547
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:26,080
"Oprop! To Danish soldiers and
the Danish people."

548
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,680
Requesting us, not to resist.
In Norwegian.

549
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,760
The Germans are coming!

550
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,360
The Germans are coming!

551
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,400
Get into positions!
Get of the road!

552
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,160
Get these children away from here!
Second lieutenant, what's the orders?

553
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:59,040
219, Set up the machine gun!
212, Start getting people off the road!

554
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,040
Faster!
Leave!

555
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,560
Lead people away now!

556
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,920
Go away!

557
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,480
Come on, god damn it!
Frederik!

558
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,960
Come on!
Frederik!

559
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,360
Frederik!
Run!

560
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,440
Let go! Frederik!

561
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,800
Run!

562
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,400
Armor!

563
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,240
Take cover!

564
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,480
Lassen, get her away!

565
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,400
Second lieutenant, what's the orders?

566
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:13,000
Bicycle platoon, we are pulling back!
Come on! We are pulling back!

567
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,120
Come on, come on, come on!

568
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,720
Who can ride a truck?
I can.

569
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,600
219, help getting the bikes up.
Yes sir.

570
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,160
Come on!
Get up, all of you!

571
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,680
Come on!
Get it up!

572
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,760
Get us of the main road.
Yes.

573
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,720
Planes, planes!
Pull in to the side.

574
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,640
We continue towards Haderslev.

575
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:43,760
If we go on Løgumklostervej,
we should be able to avoid the Germans.

576
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,960
Do it.

577
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:51,600
Do you know the area?
Born and raised in Haderslev.

578
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,120
So you are going home now?
Looks like it.

579
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,280
You did well today.

580
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:14,520
With all due respect. The military is
just something to finish quickly.

581
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,840
What do you want to do?

582
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:22,080
I want to be a merchant,
second lieutenant.

583
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,480
Merchant?
Merchant.

584
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:29,080
Find a cute girl,
get loads of children.

585
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,880
I like it simple.

586
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:39,080
If you like it simple, the military must
be something for you then.

587
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:15,960
I could have turned those bikes around
ten times while standing here.

588
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,440
Yeah, towards the Germans.
They are coming.

589
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:22,320
Then you better hurry.
The sideways are closed.

590
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:29,720
Bundgaard. Captain.
The captain won't let us in.

591
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,760
You are in our line of fire.
You can go around the city.

592
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:37,720
They can be here any time.
No one gets in from the south.

593
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:41,320
I have to speak to the colonel.
You can find him at the square.

594
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,400
You can speak to him,
when You have removed the vehicles.

595
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:47,240
I have information regarding
the German advance.

596
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,000
And I have my orders, second lieutenant.

597
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:59,040
You haven't been in combat yet?
Not yet, no.

598
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,840
I thought so.

599
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,720
We have lost men by the border
while waiting for you.

600
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,240
Cut us some slack.

601
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:16,400
Open up so the truck can fit through.

602
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,360
Thanks.
Go on.

603
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,800
We will help fortify the barracks.

604
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,680
We will announce our arrival
to the colonel.

605
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:30,880
A person was nice giving these to me.
You all deserve a smoking break.

606
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,840
Thanks.
Second lieutenant.

607
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,320
Get going!

608
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,760
...in Vojens, who heard it over
the radio, colonel.

609
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,520
Get off.
Keep it to Yourself.

610
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,200
Try get it verified.
All telephone lines are dead.

611
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,080
Find another telephone or a radio then.

612
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:13,120
Colonel Hartz? Second lieutenant Sand,
4th company, 2nd bicycle platoon.

613
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,120
Lieutenant colonel Hintz asked me,
to report to you.

614
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:20,160
You've had a busy morning.
My apologies, that we couldn't help.

615
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:23,040
But we got ordered to stay
and protect the city.

616
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,200
Planes have dropped them
over Danish towns all morning.

617
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:30,200
I've seen it before, but it's just a piece
of paper, and nothing more.

618
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:33,800
The Germans will come with motorized
infantry and armored vehicles.

619
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:37,040
It's not a fair fight.
You know, how it is.

620
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:41,840
Orders are orders. Nielsen?
Colonel.

621
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,880
Lead Sand and his men to the
positions at the approaching road.

622
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,240
They need some assistance.

623
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,480
Roger, colonel.
One of my men have lost his weapon.

624
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:54,520
And we need ammunition.
Tend to that too.

625
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:57,000
God, king and fatherland.

626
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:03,600
The colonel have given us a new
position to hold. Drop your bags.

627
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:07,680
Andersen, you'll get a new weapon.
The rest gets new ammunition.

628
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,960
Weapon?
That's me.

629
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,200
Thanks.
Ammunition?

630
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,400
Share it between you.

631
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,520
Come on. Hurry up!

632
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,560
Follow me!

633
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:53,120
We have men in position here.
And we have men in position here.

634
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:57,160
Are there new orders we need to
know straight away. Follow me.

635
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:03,080
Please get off the road.

636
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,200
Get away from here!

637
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:11,240
The colonel asked us to assist you.
What weapon do You have?

638
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:14,240
Machine gun here,
But only riffles on the other.

639
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:19,000
We need two rifflemen over there.
Andersen, Nørreskov.

640
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,600
Take position there.

641
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:25,440
Andersen, you're in charge.
Take care.

642
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,760
Roger, second lieutenant.
Go into position.

643
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,280
Follow me!

644
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,480
What's happening?
The Germans are coming!

645
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,360
Get away from the window!

646
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,760
Come with!

647
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,440
Do you think there's time for this?
Return the cups.

648
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,200
Just one cup of coffee.
You have to do it fast then, Justesen.

649
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,440
I'll take over the command.
Gram, Lassen, there.

650
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,240
Gram up, Lassen down.
Justesen, take position by the door.

651
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:14,520
You take position there.
You take position at the corner there.

652
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:18,120
Lassen, you have to move further in.
I can see them here.

653
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:22,240
I have a clear sight from here.
Do as you are told, soldier.

654
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,680
(weapons fire in the distance)

655
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,080
Armor!

656
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:29,880
They are too close!
We are pulling back!

657
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,480
Take position there!

658
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:39,280
I'm pulling back! Cover me!
I'm covering!

659
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:47,280
Nørreskov, come!

660
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,520
We have to go, now!

661
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:04,120
Andersen, I'm covering you!
Andersen! Run! Run!

662
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:07,000
Run!
Make sure you're covering him!

663
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:09,720
Get in!

664
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,800
Shoot him!

665
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:21,960
Second lieutenant!
Andersen, Nørreskov, pull back!

666
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:26,720
Pull back! Back to a new position here!
Come on, cover them!

667
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:33,640
Now! Covering fire!
Get in here!

668
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:39,200
Hold them as long as You can!
Yes sir!

669
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,160
I'm out of ammunition!

670
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,760
Hit that machine gun!
Last three!

671
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,440
We need ammunition,
second lieutenant!

672
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,960
Here.

673
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:03,760
We are pulling back! Lassen!

674
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,880
Coming!
Run, Lassen!

675
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,600
Justesen, It's your turn. Get back!

676
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:18,400
Gram, cover Justesen
to the right side of the road.

677
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,760
Justesen! Justesen!

678
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,440
Lassen, You'll run out and get Justesen!

679
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,680
Gram, You have to cover us!

680
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,760
Cover us, Gram!
Get him out!

681
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,560
Soldiers, cover us!
Lassen, we have to go! Now!

682
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:42,200
Lassen, take him here!

683
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,280
Lassen! Come on!
We'll pull him back.

684
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:51,680
Put him here! Put him here!
Stop the bleeding!

685
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,600
Are you listening? Stop the bleeding!

686
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:58,360
(noise from a vehicle)

687
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:02,920
Pull back! Behind me!

688
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,720
Come on!

689
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:10,560
Second lieutenant! Nørreskov!
What should we do now?

690
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:14,320
Gram, pull back!
Now! Now! Now!

691
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:19,520
Look at me. Breathe! Breathe!

692
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,800
Second lieutenant!

693
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:29,440
Second lieutenant, we are losing him!

694
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:33,160
We literally have no ammunition left!

695
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:39,040
Justesen, look at me.
Sec. lieutenant, what are we going to do?

696
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:42,360
Second lieutenant, what's the orders?

697
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:51,240
Second lieutenant, we need
better care for him here.

698
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,960
Look at me, Justesen.
Second lieutenant!

699
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:59,360
I don't want to die!
What are the orders, second lieutenant?

700
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,120
It's over.

701
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,880
It's over!

702
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:27,840
Drop your weapons.
Drop your weapons!

703
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,600
Drop those weapons!
Hands up!

704
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,080
How do you say
"don't shoot, we surrender"?

705
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:38,480
<i>Nicht schiessen.</i>
<i>Wir kapitulieren.</i>

706
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:42,240
<i>Nicht schiessen. Wir kapitulieren.</i>

707
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:47,800
<i>Nicht schiessen!</i>
<i>Nicht schiessen!</i>

708
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,520
<i>Nicht schiessen!</i>
<i>Wir kapitulieren!</i>

709
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:55,320
<i>Nicht schiessen!</i>
Hold up your hands.

710
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:59,480
<i>Nicht schiessen! Wir kapitulieren!</i>
<i>Nicht schiessen!</i>

711
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:04,200
<i>Hände hoch! Hände hoch!</i>
Just keep those hands high up.

712
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,960
- Get behind me, soldiers.
<i>Hände hoch!</i>

713
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:11,800
<i>Nicht schiessen!</i>
Get behind me now. Get behind me.

714
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:16,360
<i>Nicht schiessen.</i>
<i>Keine Waffen! Wir kapitulieren!</i>

715
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:19,240
(shouting in German)

716
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:10,680
<i>Aufstehen! Aufstehen!</i>

717
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:15,040
<i>Die Gefangenen wegführen. Jetzt!</i>
Stand up, everybody.

718
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:20,080
Two and two, after me.
<i>Los! Vorwärts.</i>

719
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,440
March!

720
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:45,280
<i>Leutnant, spricht jemand</i>
<i>bei Ihnen Deutsch?</i>

721
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,640
Gram.
<i>Ich spreche Deutsch.</i>

722
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:54,360
<i>Das ist nicht notwendig.</i>
It isn't necessary.

723
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,800
<i>Ich bin Oberleutnant Becker</i>
<i>von der 170. Infanteriedivision.</i>

724
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:01,800
I am Oberleutnant Becker
from the 170th infantry division.

725
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:05,320
Second lieutenant Sand.
<i>Das ist Leutnant Sand.</i>

726
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,520
<i>Sie unterstehen meiner Obhut und</i>
<i>werden in die Kaserne gebracht.</i>

727
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:16,520
You are in my custody, and will be
sent back to your barracks.

728
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,680
<i>Ich hätte eine Frage.</i>

729
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:22,240
<i>Warum um alles</i>
<i>haben Sie so lange gekämpft?</i>

730
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:26,920
He want to know why we
kept fighting for so long.

731
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:30,120
I don't understand. What do you mean?

732
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:33,600
<i>Es war nicht notwendig, dass so</i>
<i>viele das Leben lassen mussten.</i>

733
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,120
<i>Ihre Regierung</i>
<i>hat bereits kapituliert.</i>

734
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,200
It have been an unnecessary waste of life.

735
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:47,040
Because our government had already
surrendered long time ago.

736
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,960
<i>Das wussten Sie nicht?</i>

737
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,480
You didn't know?

738
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:00,280
No, I did not know that.
When did we surrender?

739
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:03,000
<i>Wann haben wir kapituliert?</i>

740
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:07,600
<i>Vor ein paar Stunden.</i>
A couple of hours ago.

741
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:14,240
<i>Gut. Sie können gerne in meinem</i>
<i>Wagen mit in die Kaserne fahren.</i>

742
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:18,400
You are welcome to wide with
him back to the barracks.

743
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,400
No thanks, I would like
to go with my men.

744
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:25,800
<i>Nein, danke. Er möchte gerne</i>
<i>mit seinen Männern fahren.</i>

745
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:28,120
<i>Ich verstehe.</i>

746
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:27,480
Yes, it was both disappointing...

747
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:33,080
...and a relief, that it was over quickly.

748
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,880
Without that many fallen Danes.

749
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:41,560
We had to surrender.
We couldn't take on Germany.

750
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:45,600
Of course we didn't like it. That's for sure.

751
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:50,240
They shouldn't occupy our country.

752
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,920
You can't be proud of,
that you have killed people.

753
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,720
And that's what it's all about.

754
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:01,760
The more you kill, the
easier it gets to win.

755
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:05,440
I can't let stuff like that go,
because there were things...

756
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,880
...that were pretty tough. But...

757
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:12,320
...but there is nothing
to do about it.

758
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:16,720
Nothing to do about it. It was a
situation I went through.

759
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:20,440
My father knows all my comrades.
Then he said:

760
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:23,440
"This I will tell you.

761
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:27,520
I would rather have heard, or hear...

762
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:33,760
Frode had fallen, than
that You haven't fought."

763
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:41,160
You are alone and have neither
a girlfriend, wife or kids.

764
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,880
So if the worst were to happen...

765
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:48,880
...then it wouldn't be the
greatest of disasters.

766
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:53,800
From the top, they said:

767
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:57,800
It was not in vain.

768
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:00,280
But the price...

769
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,280
...it was high, for some.

770
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:55,220

First time doing subs... xD
