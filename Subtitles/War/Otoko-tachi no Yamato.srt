July 31st, 1985

2
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,621
Japan's War Graves Commission
announced the discovery

3
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:41,750
of the Yamato's resting place.

4
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,505
40 years after she sank

5
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,628
In August, 1999

6
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:33,260
a shooting crew visited Yamato again

7
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:49,359
at latitude N 30.43/ longitude E 128.04,

8
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:55,365
lying 325m below the surface.

9
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,377
The birth of Yamato means

10
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:12,633
the largest warship power owned by Japan.

11
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:20,140
Symbol of the lmperial Navy,
263m long, displacing 72,800 tons

12
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:25,020
51 m from keel to tops,

13
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,524
she stood as tall as
an 18-story building.

14
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,758
"Maritime Self-Defense Supply Ship"

15
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,637
"returning from duty in Indian Ocean."

16
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:15,863
"April 6th, 2005"

17
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:10,125
Atsushi.

18
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:13,879
Washing that tub
won't make her go faster.

19
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,382
He's right. Tell old man, Kamio.

20
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:20,385
We're off.

21
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:03,387
"Makurazaki Fisherman's Cooperative"

22
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:11,520
I'd like to see the harbor master.

23
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,524
He's with a visitor.

24
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,406
Tomorrow's the 60th memorial
of the Yamato's sinking.

25
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:26,618
I was asked to get you to come for once.

26
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:36,879
I said Kamio's never been
even to one ceremony.

27
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,508
But how about it this year?

28
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:48,765
Sorry to be a trouble.

29
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:52,394
I didn't mean it like that.

30
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,774
How's the boy shaping up?

31
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,652
He's working hard.

32
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:06,033
Someone wants a boat.

33
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:07,618
To where?

34
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:17,377
Latitude N 30.43, longitude E 128.04.

35
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:21,006
That's the Yamato...

36
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,767
I'm ready to pay.

37
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,520
I just really need to go.

38
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:40,150
I'm not the harbor master.

39
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,655
I beg your pardon.

40
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:57,501
Please, introduce someone
who'll take me.

41
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:03,382
Forget it. It's 200 kilometers.

42
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:08,887
Damn rough out there, too.

43
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,766
It's no place for a landlubber.

44
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,277
I'm done, Skipper.

45
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,404
Look, Atsushi...

46
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,284
Waited long?
No

47
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,007
Excuse me.

48
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:53,140
Will someone take me
to latitude N 30

49
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:55,767
That's impossible.

50
00:07:56,018 --> 00:08:00,272
Won't someone go with me?
Forget it.

51
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:04,776
But I've got to get there.

52
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:46,401
"In Memoriam: Moriwaki, Shohachi"

53
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:05,629
"Died April 7th, 1945"

54
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,783
So...

55
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:44,376
Why do you want to go out there?

56
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,130
Well...

57
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:54,136
It's where the Yamato sank.

58
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:59,892
On April 7th, 60 years ago.

59
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,022
Tomorrow's the anniversary.

60
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,781
I really wanna go

61
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:20,662
I come this far,
only to realize it's impossible.

62
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:26,001
What's your name?

63
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,756
It's Uchida.

64
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:38,889
My father was Mamoru Uchida.

65
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:43,519
Petty Officer Uchida?

66
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,023
You knew my father?

67
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,905
But he went down with the ship.

68
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:05,040
He passed away last year.

69
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:18,011
He survived...

70
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,767
I had no idea.

71
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:31,149
He spoke of the Yamato before he died.

72
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:39,283
Told me about the true comrades
he made aboard.

73
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,503
I was selfish...
gave him nothing but grief...

74
00:11:53,255 --> 00:12:00,888
Never tried to get a sense of his life.

75
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,143
Now he's gone...

76
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:12,024
I want to know all about him.

77
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,655
I must've been an ungrateful child.

78
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:25,662
It'll take 15 hours.

79
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,918
The sea will be rough.

80
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:36,632
If you still want to go.

81
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,013
Will you take me?

82
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,527
I couldn't find Atsushi.

83
00:12:56,777 --> 00:13:02,157
Turns out he's put to sea
with that woman.

84
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:07,162
In that old boat?

85
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:45,158
Kamio-san, my father mentioned you.

86
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,666
Do you know these men?

87
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,672
This was among his things.

88
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:04,636
Says it was taken in 1943 in Kure.

89
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:16,523
Moriwaki-san, Uchida-san
& Karaki-san...

90
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:39,546
"March, 1942"

91
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:43,759
Mom, I'm back Katsumi Kamio - age 15

92
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,512
You twos are back

93
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,138
I'm back

94
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,894
Mom, no-one uses the boat,
so why clean it every day?

95
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:57,397
If your brother returns from the war

96
00:14:57,648 --> 00:15:03,153
and it's not ready,
I'll be in big trouble.

97
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:08,033
Aunty, did Kamio really volunteer
for the Navy?

98
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,915
My brother signed up.
I can't let him outdo me.

99
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,046
But 15 year-old kids
shouldn't go to war.

100
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,422
Right, Aunty?

101
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,675
Don't worry

102
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:27,386
America is a place believe in indicidualism

103
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:31,139
The papers say the Yanks are
too individualistic to fight for long.

104
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,521
We better hope they're right.

105
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:41,650
Mom, stop worrying!

106
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,653
Drop by later, Taeko.

107
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:54,163
Cadet Seaman, Kamio, Katsumi.

108
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:57,666
Reporting for duty!

109
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,550
You don't look so tough to me.

110
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:18,270
Skipper, you went to war at 15?

111
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,403
How old are you, Atsushi?

112
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:27,404
15

113
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:33,285
Well, you're already working hard.

114
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,789
Saving to buy a motor-bike.

115
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:43,420
Skip', says I'll get extra
for this trip.

116
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:48,675
Go open the engine hatch.

117
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,769
Sorry you've extra expense
for my sake.

118
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:04,274
Don't worry. It's not for your sake.

119
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,680
June, 1941. In protest at Japan's
invasion of China,

120
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,393
Britain, the US and Holland

121
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,896
impose sanctions and an oil embargo.

122
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:28,650
To avoid suck risk of economic loss,

123
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:32,529
Japan breaks the impasse on December 8th,

124
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,406
Japan launched the attack
on Pearl Harbor.

125
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:44,416
On that same day, Yamato
began her sea trials.

126
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:49,296
6 months later, Japan's advance

127
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:53,926
Hongkong, Malaysia, Singapore, Phillipine

128
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:57,179
and even Indonesia

129
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,683
"June, 1942"

130
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,395
However, Japan suffers a major defeat
at Midway.

131
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:07,397
By the US army.

132
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:11,401
The tides of battle turns

133
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:18,784
"August, 1942"

134
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:24,039
American forces land on Guadalcanal.

135
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:28,293
After 6 months of bitter fighting,

136
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:32,798
Japan withdraws.

137
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:40,556
Commander of the Combined Fleet
Isoroku Yamamoto,

138
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:47,521
April, 18th, in combat

139
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:51,149
met with US planes over the Pacific

140
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:55,279
with a worthy death.

141
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:59,908
Promoted to the Supreme
Military Council,

142
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:05,289
as Fleet Admiral on June 5th.

143
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:09,543
He was buried with full honors

144
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,177
"Spring, 1944 - Kure Harbor"

145
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:29,771
As the military situation deteriorated
cadet training was speeded up.

146
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:33,775
And they were quickly
shipped off to battle.

147
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:39,406
Many were boys barely 16 years old.

148
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:47,289
It's the Yamato.

149
00:20:57,174 --> 00:21:01,178
Biggest warship in the world.
Incredible

150
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,430
A floating mountain.

151
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:06,433
And we're going aboard.

152
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,546
You're slow! Hurry up!

153
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:43,053
When the ensign's aloft,
salute only officers.

154
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,931
Do not salute enlisted ranks.

155
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:12,541

00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:45,068
Petty Officer Moriwaki.

184
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:54,411
I'm not done. One more!

185
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:57,039
Come on, then.

186
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:04,922
Attention! Follow your officer

187
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:07,549
Squad leaders, all hands
to duty stations.

188
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:10,802
4th Machine-Gun Squad!

189
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:50,425
This is your battle station.

190
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:52,928
Do not forget it.

191
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:09,945
Don't look down! Hurry up!

192
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,043
The new recruits are here.

193
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:26,545
Cadet Kojima.

194
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:28,297
Cadet Tsukaguchi.

195
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:43,437
Squad of 9, please.

196
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:45,814
Squad of 11, please.

197
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:47,441
Squad of 15, please.

198
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:53,697
Moriwaki, sir. New arrivals.

199
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:55,574
Seaman, Tokita, sir.

200
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:56,533
Ozawa, sir.

201
00:26:58,035 --> 00:27:01,914
Ever cooked rice?

202
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:05,792
Only once at school.

203
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:18,931
Spend today watching the others.

204
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:28,190
We cook for all 2,500 men right here.

205
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:33,070
Keep your wits about you.

206
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:43,163
Tradition says that here in the boiler,

207
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:49,169
our fate is to go down with the ship.

208
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:54,925
But the Yamato won't go down.
Got that?

209
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:26,540
Get a move on!

210
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:19,927
Loaders!

211
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:37,069
Right, ready!

212
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,195
Left, ready!

213
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:41,824
Ready to fire.

214
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:46,578
What the hell are you doing?!

215
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:58,423
Anti-aircraft action!

216
00:29:58,674 --> 00:29:59,550
Gunner ready!

217
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,927
Loaders!

218
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:08,559
Left ready!

219
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:11,812
- Center ready!
- Right Ready!

220
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:12,938
Ready to engage!

221
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:14,439
Gun Four ready!

222
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:16,191
Gun Two ready!

223
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:17,442
Gun Four ready!

224
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:25,075
Messenger, standing-by!

225
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:27,202
Hi-Angle AA Guns, ready!

226
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:28,704
Messengers ready

227
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:35,919
All hands in position.
9 minutes & 45 seconds.

228
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:41,425
Too slow. Repeat the drill
until it's 5 minutes faster.

229
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:48,807
Nishi, hold on.

230
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:51,560
Imbecile!

231
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:56,315
Dropping a goddamn shell!

232
00:30:57,316 --> 00:31:00,819
We live or die together in the Navy.

233
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:04,698
One mistake and we're all dead.

234
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:09,953
You could've killed us all!

235
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:16,543
Stand.

236
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:20,172
Ass out.

237
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:27,054
Ass out.

238
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:36,188
Learn your lesson!

239
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:42,546
All hands in position.
5 minutes & 54 seconds.

240
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:44,047
Good enough.

241
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:51,805
It's a catastrophe.

242
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:59,563
Someone in our block
left a porthole open.

243
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:09,072
In wartime, it's inexcusable.

244
00:33:09,198 --> 00:33:11,825
Worse, it was seen by other ships.
Yamato is disgraced.

245
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:20,584
The culprit is standing here.

246
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:32,179
Come forward now.

247
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:40,312
Right now!

248
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:48,946
If you do, I'll be lenient.

249
00:33:57,579 --> 00:33:59,706
I understand.

250
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:05,212
Group responsibility, then.

251
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:09,299
No visits to the PX.

252
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,677
Indefinitely.

253
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:20,435
It was me.

254
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,947
You bastard...

255
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:40,706
All but Kamio, dismissed.

256
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:51,675
Spread your legs.

257
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,928
Hands up, grit your teeth!

258
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:16,700
Take over.

259
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:20,704
I can't do that.

260
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:26,585
Ignoring an order?

261
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:29,087
Do it.

262
00:35:30,214 --> 00:35:31,465
Why not?!

263
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,450
Get up.

264
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:16,593
What the hell's that?!

265
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:19,054
It's sailors like you,

266
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:22,057
who let the ranks get soft.

267
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:27,938
Move.

268
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:37,447
Uchida, legs apart,
arms out, teeth grit.

269
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:48,083
Give me the pipe.

270
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:55,215
I'll beat Naval spirit into you.

271
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:05,934
I'm not done yet.

272
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:21,325
Bastard...

273
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:25,204
What did you try to do?

274
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,707
You hit the bone.

275
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:35,088
Bust my leg and I won't get to fight!

276
00:37:39,468 --> 00:37:43,055
Think bullying cadets
can win the war?

277
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:15,462
Kamio, he hit a superior.

278
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:17,589
He won't get away with it.

279
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:21,343
What's the crime?

280
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:25,848
At worst, mutiny...

281
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:27,182
and a court martial.

282
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:28,308
Surely not.

283
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:34,439
We have to obey absolutely.

284
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,945
Didn't you close the hatch?

285
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:47,953
You goddamn idiot!
Playing the hero!

286
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:49,204
Shut up!

287
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:52,708
Kamio, I'm sorry.

288
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:58,088
It was me. Hit me, please.

289
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:04,344
I was thinking of the guys...

290
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:10,058
Not being a hero!

291
00:39:20,694 --> 00:39:23,822
It's either each of you
for yourself...

292
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:26,950
Or all for one!

293
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:37,836
I'll talk to Chief Moriwaki.

294
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:40,964
Idiot!

295
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:45,219
It's no business for a recruit!

296
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:47,471
And nothing to do with my kitchen!

297
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:50,224
Get back to work!

298
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:55,687
Chief Moriwaki, sir!

299
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:03,445
Kamio from gunnery.

300
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:06,073
What the hell do you want?

301
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:33,600
Moriwaki... what is it?

302
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:35,686
Grub's up.

303
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:43,944
You're a pain in the ass.

304
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:47,322
My ass is my business.

305
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:48,824
Idiot.

306
00:40:50,450 --> 00:41:01,461
One of the new kids... Kamio
came crying to me to help you.

307
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:04,339
Kamio did?

308
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:11,471
I spoke to Machimura.
He'll forget that you hit him,

309
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:17,477
if you forget he nearly
broke your leg.

310
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:22,816
I'm not worried about myself.

311
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,949
If he vows not to hit others,

312
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:35,454
tell him I'll call it quits.

313
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:40,334
Always so noble-minded...

314
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:45,339
In battle, you don't know
who'll get hit.

315
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:48,342
Survivors have to take over.

316
00:41:49,468 --> 00:41:50,719
Kamio...

317
00:41:56,475 --> 00:41:59,102
This handle controls elevation.

318
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:02,940
When you're on target, that pedal
is the trigger.

319
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:07,444
Elevation 45 degrees.

320
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:09,071
Take aim!

321
00:42:11,698 --> 00:42:15,452
Other way, idiot!

322
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:18,205
Mizutani.

323
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:26,463
This controls the gun's bearing.

324
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:29,216
Right, 30 degrees.

325
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:31,093
Take aim!

326
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:37,724
Okay...

327
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:42,729
Elevation 60 degrees,
bear right 45 degrees.

328
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,356
Take aim!

329
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:57,578
An enemy fighter travels
180 meters a second.

330
00:42:58,704 --> 00:43:04,334
If you react slowly, if the gun jams,

331
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,212
you're all killed in action.

332
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:10,591
Dead men can't fight.

333
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:13,844
So you fight to survive.

334
00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:17,723
That's why we drill.

335
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,226
Don't you forget it!

336
00:43:36,825 --> 00:43:38,327
Are you okay?

337
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:45,083
Get water and sea-sick tablets.

338
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:48,212
I'm fine.

339
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:00,974
Take a seat.

340
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:05,354
Thank you.

341
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:14,196
Take this
Thank you.

342
00:44:17,574 --> 00:44:20,202
It'll get rougher.

343
00:44:21,078 --> 00:44:23,705
If we're turning back
we do it now.

344
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:27,960
I'll be okay.

345
00:44:30,212 --> 00:44:32,339
Please let me go.

346
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:38,595
You dig your heels in
just like your Dad.

347
00:44:41,223 --> 00:44:45,477
I'm not his real daughter.

348
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:56,697
After the war, he went back to Nagoya

349
00:44:57,823 --> 00:45:02,703
eventually adopting 11 of us
over 15 years.

350
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:08,083
And began looking after orphans

351
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:20,095
Uchida did that?

352
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,973
Other people's kids?

353
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:29,980
On behalf of those
that didn't make it.

354
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:33,609
Didn't make it?

355
00:45:35,486 --> 00:45:39,573
People killed in the war.

356
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:47,456
There were over 3,000
on the Yamato alone.

357
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:08,352
"Early Summer, 1944"

358
00:46:29,832 --> 00:46:32,835
You're lucky, being close to home.

359
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,587
What are you all going to do?

360
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:40,342
I'm going to the baths.
Haven't been for a week.

361
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:45,848
I'm going to the movies.
Mizutani, want to come?

362
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:51,228
A movie, huh? It's been ages.

363
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:53,730
Nishi, you?

364
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:58,861
I wonder...

365
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:04,700
If you've nothing else,
want to come to my house?

366
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,326
Is that okay?

367
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:08,328
Of course it is.

368
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:14,960
See you.

369
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:43,113
That's Kure,
where the Yamato was built.

370
00:47:46,116 --> 00:47:47,326
Let's go.

371
00:47:47,701 --> 00:47:48,827
Kamio...

372
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:52,206
Is there a post office?

373
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:55,209
Uncensored letters,

374
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:57,461
can get you court-martialed.

375
00:47:58,337 --> 00:48:01,590
Please, don't tell anyone.

376
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:05,344
Don't worry, I'm teasing.

377
00:48:05,969 --> 00:48:07,846
It's just there.

378
00:48:08,597 --> 00:48:09,973
Thanks.

379
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:20,108
Mother, I'm sending you some money.

380
00:48:23,737 --> 00:48:28,367
Here's your receipt, 4 yen, 75 sen.

381
00:48:54,226 --> 00:48:57,980
Let's wash our hands and go pray.

382
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:28,719
Kamio!

383
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:30,846
Taeko!

384
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:33,974
Aunty and I prayed every day

385
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:36,476
for your return.

386
00:49:36,602 --> 00:49:38,228
Thanks.

387
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:52,743
This is Nishi.
A friend from the cadet corps.

388
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:54,119
Nishi, sir!

389
00:50:01,084 --> 00:50:05,214
Why don't you draw her picture?

390
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:07,966
He's great at drawing.

391
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:11,470
Got any paper?

392
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,222
I'll go get some.

393
00:50:19,228 --> 00:50:20,979
Hey, Mom!

394
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:29,363
Since his brother got drafted
and went off to fight

395
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:34,117
no-one uses this boat any more.

396
00:50:37,246 --> 00:50:40,082
Don't move or he'll draw
you like a witch.

397
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:44,211
No, make me beautiful.

398
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:48,465
Taeko, you already are.

399
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:53,095
Really?

400
00:50:53,846 --> 00:50:55,347
How nice!

401
00:50:55,472 --> 00:50:58,100
He always talks about you.

402
00:50:58,225 --> 00:51:01,603
Nishi, keep your mouth shut!

403
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:09,236
Let's go.
Mom's made sweet bean soup.

404
00:51:12,114 --> 00:51:13,991
Hurry up!

405
00:51:18,871 --> 00:51:20,622
It's really good.

406
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:23,584
He made you into a beauty.

407
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:28,589
Thanks to the model.

408
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:31,216
Of course, I am really pretty

409
00:51:31,842 --> 00:51:33,468
Of course...

410
00:51:36,346 --> 00:51:40,475
Nishi's Father died.

411
00:51:43,353 --> 00:51:46,231
Killed in combat in Shanghai.

412
00:51:46,356 --> 00:51:51,361
Then why did you join up?

413
00:51:52,488 --> 00:51:56,617
We're peasant farmers, no cash income.

414
00:52:01,497 --> 00:52:03,624
Would you like some more?

415
00:52:09,588 --> 00:52:13,091
Every family has a story

416
00:52:13,717 --> 00:52:19,848
"Banzai" they said,

417
00:52:20,724 --> 00:52:24,728
and two of mine gave themselves
for the country.

418
00:52:30,984 --> 00:52:35,364
The war will be over soon.

419
00:52:35,614 --> 00:52:38,242
My brother will be back.

420
00:52:38,867 --> 00:52:46,250
I'll be waiting for you both.

421
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,467
Don't get yourself killed.

422
00:53:04,101 --> 00:53:07,855
"June 15th, 1944"

423
00:53:08,105 --> 00:53:11,108
"US forces land on Saipan, breaching"

424
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:13,986
"Japan's defensive perimeter."

425
00:53:14,236 --> 00:53:16,613
"All defenders meet brave"

426
00:53:16,864 --> 00:53:19,366
"and heroic end."

427
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:30,377
Nonsense

428
00:53:30,752 --> 00:53:32,462
I didn't lie

429
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:37,092
You are a liar

430
00:53:42,598 --> 00:53:46,226
You guys are making a damn racket.

431
00:53:48,228 --> 00:53:50,606
What's the matter?

432
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:55,486
I said what's the damn problem!?

433
00:53:56,236 --> 00:54:00,866
He says that Saipan's defense
fought to the death.

434
00:54:03,494 --> 00:54:06,997
I heard it from the officers
on the bridge.

435
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:13,128
Kamio says if Saipan falls
Japan is lost.

436
00:54:14,505 --> 00:54:18,342
So he refuses to believe me.

437
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:21,345
Accused me of spreading lies.

438
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:29,102
Kamio, it's true that Saipan fell.

439
00:54:30,479 --> 00:54:32,231
What'll you do about it?

440
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:38,862
Run? Surrender?

441
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:43,992
Neither. Fight.

442
00:54:45,244 --> 00:54:48,247
Fight with every ounce of strength!

443
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:57,840
What about you?

444
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:04,221
To protect Japan, I'll fight to the end!

445
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:10,352
Is that right...

446
00:55:13,605 --> 00:55:14,982
Fight for it

447
00:55:20,112 --> 00:55:24,116
Sweet potato cakes.

448
00:55:25,993 --> 00:55:31,874
Share them out.
Make yourselves popular.

449
00:55:34,126 --> 00:55:36,628
Thank you very much.

450
00:55:36,753 --> 00:55:39,006
Leading Seaman, Tamaki, sir.

451
00:55:43,218 --> 00:55:45,971
Chief Moriwaki ordered me here.

452
00:55:48,974 --> 00:55:54,354
Mom sent an amulet for you
in our care package.

453
00:55:57,858 --> 00:55:59,359
Sumio...

454
00:56:00,486 --> 00:56:06,241
Even if you were put up for adoption,
don't be so hard-headed.

455
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:10,746
She's still your mother.

456
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:22,007
If anyone bullies you,

457
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:26,094
tell them you're my brother.

458
00:56:27,346 --> 00:56:28,847
No way.

459
00:56:30,224 --> 00:56:31,850
I will not tell them.

460
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:44,863
That's the dagger you got
from Admiral Yamamoto?

461
00:56:45,864 --> 00:56:48,742
It's my treasured possession.

462
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:53,247
He must have really valued

463
00:56:53,372 --> 00:56:56,500
your work for him.

464
00:56:58,502 --> 00:57:00,379
I treasure this with my life.

465
00:57:05,384 --> 00:57:08,220
Hope that doesn't get put to the test.

466
00:57:10,722 --> 00:57:14,977

472
00:57:45,757 --> 00:57:47,134
Get away from it

473
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:49,761
Watch out The front

474
00:57:51,096 --> 00:57:54,474
Get away from it

475
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:23,629
Open fire!

476
00:58:55,244 --> 00:58:58,997
2nd Turret, Fire Controller is down!

477
00:58:59,122 --> 00:59:00,999
I'll take over!

478
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:03,752
You're in charge.

479
00:59:05,003 --> 00:59:06,630
Again, fire

480
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:17,474
Left 30, elevation 40 degrees!

481
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:27,359
Load the bullet, ready

482
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:34,741
Elevation 50!

483
00:59:49,256 --> 00:59:50,757
Where's Uchida?

484
00:59:51,383 --> 00:59:54,636
Directing fire up top.

485
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:00,476
Right 20!

486
01:00:16,116 --> 01:00:18,243

487
01:00:38,388 --> 01:00:39,765
Uchida!

488
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:41,517
PO Uchida.

489
01:00:41,642 --> 01:00:44,478
Back to your posts!

490
01:00:45,354 --> 01:00:49,107
Uchida!

491
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:51,610
Uchida!

492
01:00:57,491 --> 01:00:58,367
Please treat him.

493
01:01:08,877 --> 01:01:11,004
Treat him please!

494
01:01:13,131 --> 01:01:17,636
Please treat him.

495
01:01:19,263 --> 01:01:20,264
Treat him!

496
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,231
Hurry up

497
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:35,112
Men that can rejoin the fight
go first.

498
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:47,875
In 5 days of combat in Leyte Gulf

499
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:53,881
The Combined Fleet lost 3 battleships,

500
01:01:54,006 --> 01:02:01,013
4 carriers, 9 cruisers & 8 destroyers.

501
01:02:01,013 --> 01:02:05,767
Surviving ships had extensive damage.

502
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:11,482
Japan's Surface Fleet
was practically annihilated.

503
01:02:13,734 --> 01:02:15,235
Tokita!

504
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:20,491
Get changed and go
to the weather deck.

505
01:02:20,741 --> 01:02:24,244
That's out of bounds for us, sir.

506
01:02:24,495 --> 01:02:25,996
Do what I say!

507
01:02:26,246 --> 01:02:28,999
Querying the Captain's thoughtfulness?

508
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:31,877
Move!

509
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:39,635
That was his brother, huh?

510
01:03:09,122 --> 01:03:15,254
Your brother died a hero.

511
01:03:19,758 --> 01:03:24,513
I know he used to beat you...

512
01:03:27,391 --> 01:03:28,767
I'm sorry.

513
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:40,112
Salute!

Petty Officer 1st Class Takamura...
Leading Seamen Tamaki...

515
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:17,024
Salute!

516
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:27,117
At ease.

517
01:04:29,495 --> 01:04:31,371
Brother!

518
01:04:33,874 --> 01:04:36,376
Farewell!

519
01:04:42,633 --> 01:04:46,261
Uchida lost his left eye

520
01:04:47,513 --> 01:04:52,267
and was shot through his shoulder
and hip, too.

521
01:04:55,145 --> 01:04:57,272
Serious wounds.

522
01:04:58,899 --> 01:05:02,486
He was hospitalized in Singapore.

523
01:05:02,861 --> 01:05:06,240
Then sent to Kure to recover.

524
01:05:08,242 --> 01:05:10,619
It's the first I heard about it.

525
01:05:14,498 --> 01:05:20,879
He never talked about himself.

526
01:05:22,506 --> 01:05:28,637
Only about Moriwaki and Karaki,

527
01:05:29,263 --> 01:05:30,639
and of course,

528
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:35,519
you and the other cadets.

529
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:47,364
Thank you.

530
01:06:34,369 --> 01:06:37,998
Salute Vice-Admiral lto!

531
01:06:41,251 --> 01:06:42,753
At ease.

532
01:06:46,131 --> 01:06:48,884
I'll show you to your quarters, sir.

533
01:06:52,387 --> 01:06:55,390
Aboard the newly-repaired Yamato.

534
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:59,520
Commander of 2nd Fleet,
Vice-Admiral Seichi lto

535
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,271
took his command.

536
01:07:05,526 --> 01:07:07,903
On March 10th, 1945.

537
01:07:08,278 --> 01:07:12,366
US bombers from Saipan,

538
01:07:12,616 --> 01:07:16,119
began indiscriminate
bombing of urban areas.

539
01:07:16,745 --> 01:07:21,124
That night alone, huge areas
of Tokyo were razed.

540
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:31,385
Further firebomb raids then followed
on Nagoya and Osaka.

541
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:35,389
On March 19th

542
01:07:35,514 --> 01:07:42,396
a force of 70 planes raided
Hiroshima and Kure

543
01:07:42,896 --> 01:07:46,024
aiming for shipping

544
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:50,654
and the naval boatyards.

545
01:08:14,136 --> 01:08:16,263
"Several days later,"

546
01:08:16,513 --> 01:08:21,018
"hundreds of fighters and bombers"

547
01:08:21,268 --> 01:08:25,772
"launched massive aerial attacks"

548
01:08:26,023 --> 01:08:30,527
"on every one of Okinawa's airfields"

549
01:08:36,992 --> 01:08:38,619
Petty Officer Karaki.

550
01:08:39,995 --> 01:08:40,871
What?

551
01:08:41,872 --> 01:08:47,377
We heard rumor that Yamato's
heading for Okinawa.

552
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:53,383
If Okinawa falls
the homeland is threatened.

553
01:08:55,010 --> 01:09:01,266
Our Kamikaze hit
the US Task Forces every day.

554
01:09:02,142 --> 01:09:05,270
The Yamato can't sit around
doing nothing.

555
01:09:11,527 --> 01:09:16,281
You've all been through Leyte
so you appreciate...

556
01:09:20,244 --> 01:09:21,995
who's to die...

557
01:09:24,248 --> 01:09:25,999
when we die...

558
01:09:27,251 --> 01:09:29,378
no-one knows.

559
01:09:33,257 --> 01:09:37,010
We're all fully prepared
to give our lives.

560
01:09:37,261 --> 01:09:39,138
Every one of us!

561
01:09:54,653 --> 01:09:56,155
Look what arrived...

562
01:09:58,031 --> 01:10:01,785
Attention, elder sons or those

563
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:04,746
who are sole support of families

564
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,376
Tokita.

565
01:10:12,254 --> 01:10:13,255
Come here.

566
01:10:23,265 --> 01:10:28,020
You lost your elder brother.

567
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:32,900
Sign this and you can leave the ship.

568
01:10:34,776 --> 01:10:37,905
I can't leave by myself.

569
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:44,036
Who'll support your mother?

570
01:10:47,122 --> 01:10:52,252
I was sent for adoption.
I have no mother.

571
01:10:52,753 --> 01:10:56,006
I'll fight to the end with my mates.

572
01:11:02,012 --> 01:11:03,639
Really.

573
01:11:07,267 --> 01:11:11,522
Back to bed.

574
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:16,777
Excuse me, sir.

575
01:11:32,751 --> 01:11:39,007
The Cadets said they're ready
to give their lives.

576
01:11:42,386 --> 01:11:44,012
Damn...

577
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,393
Just a bunch of kids...

578
01:11:53,522 --> 01:12:00,279
They've got no idea
what death means...

579
01:12:10,539 --> 01:12:11,540
What?

580
01:12:12,624 --> 01:12:15,002
Dat? From Signals, sir.

581
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:17,754
May I ask a question?

582
01:12:18,505 --> 01:12:19,882
What is it?

583
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:25,762
Below decks, I heard
you'd been discussing chivalry.

584
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:32,269
What's the difference between
chivalry and bushido?

585
01:12:32,895 --> 01:12:34,646
Please tell me.

586
01:12:38,025 --> 01:12:44,031
Simply put, bushido
readies us for death with no reward.

587
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:50,037
Chivalry, eschews thoughts of death
and looks to honorable living.

588
01:12:53,165 --> 01:12:58,504
One prepares for life
the other for death?

589
01:12:58,504 --> 01:13:00,380
Am I right?

590
01:13:01,256 --> 01:13:07,763
Preparation for either
is no simple matter.

591
01:13:11,141 --> 01:13:13,769
My Mother and sister

592
01:13:15,145 --> 01:13:20,150
are a stone's throw from Okinawa.

593
01:13:25,155 --> 01:13:27,157
Whatever it takes.

594
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:30,911
I want to protect them.

595
01:13:33,288 --> 01:13:38,377
"March 25th, 1945"

596
01:13:41,004 --> 01:13:45,008
"Knowing it was for the last time"

597
01:13:45,259 --> 01:13:49,638
"they headed ashore for final leave."

598
01:13:55,519 --> 01:13:59,898
Long time, no see.

599
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:02,901
Welcome back, sir.

600
01:14:03,152 --> 01:14:05,028
Souvenirs...

601
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:09,908
You're so kind.

602
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,036
I'm up in the room.

603
01:14:13,162 --> 01:14:14,663
Take a nice, long bath.

604
01:14:15,539 --> 01:14:17,040
And you, Chief?

605
01:14:17,666 --> 01:14:23,755
I've got to be somewhere.
Don't forget, tomorrow, 0800.

606
01:14:30,012 --> 01:14:32,264
Your room's this way.

607
01:14:42,274 --> 01:14:43,775
Son...

608
01:14:45,527 --> 01:14:47,529
Why are you here?

609
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:53,035
Moriwaki-san cabled me.

610
01:14:53,285 --> 01:14:55,537
Chief Moriwaki?

611
01:14:56,538 --> 01:14:59,166
You're lucky he's your officer.

612
01:15:13,889 --> 01:15:20,896
It's a lock of brother's hair.

613
01:15:31,907 --> 01:15:36,787
He died a splendid death.

614
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:48,507
Have some of my cakes.

615
01:15:49,883 --> 01:15:55,764
My sugar ration was tiny
so they're not so sweet.

616
01:16:04,273 --> 01:16:05,774
Quick, eat up...

617
01:16:17,411 --> 01:16:18,912
Have another.

618
01:16:24,668 --> 01:16:27,796
Here's tea, too...

619
01:16:36,513 --> 01:16:43,520
Mother, I go off to serve my country.

620
01:16:45,022 --> 01:16:47,149
How are the fields?

621
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:55,282
Mother, I beg you please,

622
01:16:56,158 --> 01:16:57,910
please try to...

623
01:16:59,661 --> 01:17:01,788
Forget me...

624
01:17:02,789 --> 01:17:04,666
Goodbye.

625
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:34,298
Forgive me, please.

626
01:18:35,799 --> 01:18:38,177
Forgive me.

627
01:18:39,428 --> 01:18:41,013
Taeko

628
01:18:43,515 --> 01:18:45,142
What's wrong?

629
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:51,899
Your Mom's death...

630
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:55,027
it was my fault.

631
01:18:56,904 --> 01:18:59,406
Forgive me!

632
01:19:01,533 --> 01:19:03,535
What happened?

633
01:19:06,413 --> 01:19:09,416
Stop crying and tell me!

634
01:19:15,672 --> 01:19:19,301
It was the attack on March 19th...

635
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:52,793
Aunty?

636
01:19:54,795 --> 01:19:56,672
Aunty!

637
01:20:26,285 --> 01:20:28,412
My brother died.

638
01:20:31,415 --> 01:20:33,292
Now...

639
01:20:35,544 --> 01:20:37,921
I'm all alone.

640
01:20:47,431 --> 01:20:49,057
Kamio...

641
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:56,398
The Yamato's going to Okinawa.

642
01:21:03,655 --> 01:21:06,283
Will you die, too?

643
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:16,919
Don't...

644
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:20,797
Don't...

645
01:21:22,049 --> 01:21:25,302
Please don't...

646
01:21:27,429 --> 01:21:30,182
You can't die.

647
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:43,028
Taeko

648
01:21:45,405 --> 01:21:50,661
I'm scared of dying but...

649
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:58,544
My brother died, my Mother died...

650
01:22:02,297 --> 01:22:07,928
In Tokyo, Osaka,
tens of thousands died...

651
01:22:10,055 --> 01:22:15,060
Many people are killed by an air attack

652
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:16,770
I don't want more people to die

653
01:22:18,772 --> 01:22:25,529
I'll go to Okinawa...
to hell and back, if needed.

654
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:32,536
Kamio...

655
01:22:35,164 --> 01:22:38,041
I don't understand.

656
01:22:42,421 --> 01:22:45,174
If you die...

657
01:22:48,177 --> 01:22:51,305
If you die, what about me?

658
01:22:59,771 --> 01:23:02,274
I love you.

659
01:23:05,652 --> 01:23:08,030
I love you so much!

660
01:23:34,306 --> 01:23:35,933
How are you, huh?

661
01:23:37,434 --> 01:23:39,186
Long time no see.

662
01:23:39,311 --> 01:23:43,273
Doc couldn't believe it.

663
01:23:43,524 --> 01:23:47,653
Someone with that many wounds
surviving...

664
01:23:47,903 --> 01:23:51,907
I'm like the Yamato, unsinkable.

665
01:23:52,157 --> 01:23:57,287
Get well soon.
I need a sparring partner.

666
01:23:58,539 --> 01:24:02,918
Have you got time
to come hang out here?

667
01:24:05,671 --> 01:24:08,549
I thought I should bring these.

668
01:24:09,925 --> 01:24:13,679
I was looking after them.

669
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:17,057
Your treasured possessions.

670
01:24:29,653 --> 01:24:31,530
The Okinawa sortie, huh?

671
01:24:33,031 --> 01:24:34,283
When?

672
01:24:36,785 --> 01:24:39,037
What are you talking about?

673
01:24:43,167 --> 01:24:45,794
You came to say farewell?

674
01:24:50,674 --> 01:24:57,931
Hospital's made you go soft
in the head.

675
01:25:04,938 --> 01:25:12,154
The sakura look pretty this year.

676
01:25:17,034 --> 01:25:18,785
Falling petals...

677
01:25:22,164 --> 01:25:24,416
Remaining petals...

678
01:25:26,543 --> 01:25:28,545
All fall in the end.

679
01:25:36,929 --> 01:25:39,056
Let's leave it at that.

680
01:25:58,784 --> 01:26:04,665
No ticket. Can't come.
We are well.

681
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:10,170
Hey son. Daddy's here.

682
01:26:11,296 --> 01:26:16,927
With 3 days' warning, I can get
a ticket to come see you off.

683
01:26:20,681 --> 01:26:24,059
Don't cry, Kazuo.

684
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:50,043
Playing hooky from work?

685
01:26:50,669 --> 01:26:52,421
Why are you here?

686
01:26:53,672 --> 01:26:57,676
I snuck out of hospital.

687
01:26:58,177 --> 01:27:01,180
What happened to your eye?

688
01:27:02,055 --> 01:27:04,057
Why didn't you tell me?

689
01:27:04,183 --> 01:27:05,809
Military secret.

690
01:27:06,059 --> 01:27:12,191
Since when did you care
about military rules?

691
01:27:12,816 --> 01:27:17,404
You always found a way
to come see me, legal or not.

692
01:27:17,654 --> 01:27:19,656
Anyway...

693
01:27:20,032 --> 01:27:23,410
You don't care about my feelings.

694
01:27:24,411 --> 01:27:25,913
Take it.

695
01:27:35,047 --> 01:27:39,802
It's no big deal. Go on.

696
01:27:42,554 --> 01:27:43,931
My dear...

697
01:27:46,683 --> 01:27:49,812
You can't go to Okinawa like that.

698
01:27:52,314 --> 01:27:57,945
I'm convalescing in Kure.

699
01:27:59,696 --> 01:28:03,283
I just slipped out to see you.

700
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:09,790
So you aren't going anywhere.

701
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:13,418
Right.

702
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:19,925
Then I shouldn't take this off you.

703
01:28:20,175 --> 01:28:22,177
Don't be stupid.

704
01:28:22,427 --> 01:28:25,430
What if a bomb falls on me.
Then it'll all be over.

705
01:28:26,306 --> 01:28:30,686
Nowadays, you'd better keep it

706
01:28:36,942 --> 01:28:38,443
What?

707
01:28:44,283 --> 01:28:47,411
You never talk like this.

708
01:28:47,661 --> 01:28:51,039
Give me a break.

709
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:53,542
Will you just take it?

710
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:17,816
Stop.

711
01:29:19,318 --> 01:29:24,448
I'm not ready for a woman yet.

712
01:29:28,285 --> 01:29:30,662
I just want to hold you.

713
01:29:32,664 --> 01:29:35,042
You don't have to do anything.

714
01:29:37,169 --> 01:29:43,050
I just want to feel you
against my skin.

715
01:29:51,934 --> 01:29:53,310
Lie down.

716
01:29:59,316 --> 01:30:02,444
Come here.

717
01:30:02,694 --> 01:30:04,571
Really?

718
01:31:10,053 --> 01:31:12,556
When the war's over

719
01:31:15,809 --> 01:31:18,312
make me your wife.

720
01:31:24,693 --> 01:31:27,070
Maybe before then

721
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,702
I'll have turned into a ghost.

722
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:41,543
Makes no difference.

723
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:46,423
I'll be back in Hiroshima

724
01:31:47,299 --> 01:31:50,928
waiting for you.

725
01:32:16,078 --> 01:32:17,704
All bets in.
