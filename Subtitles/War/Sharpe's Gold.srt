1
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,030
(Shouting in French)

2
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,830
Good lad. Good lad.

3
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,500
- We've got 'em going now.
- They're well away.

4
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,390
SOLDIER: Vite par ici!

5
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,230
(Women scream)

6
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,270
SOLDIER: Allez!

7
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,270
Where the hell have they got to?

8
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,990
- I can hear the drums.
- That's not exactly enough.

9
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,750
Rifles!

10
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,990
(Blows whistle)

11
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,110
Look at it. Clean through the whole bloody lot.

12
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,870
Argh.

13
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,950
Well, will you look at this.

14
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,990
SHARPE: Our absent friends.

15
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,430
REDCOAT: Look at it all!

16
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,980
REDCOAT: Come on.
SHARPE: Sergeant, come here.

17
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,030
REDCOAT: Get out of my way.

18
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,590
- Where did you get to?
- Up at the top, sir, as ordered.

19
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,790
- And you sat tight?
- We was all set to move, just as soon as...

20
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,790
SHARPE: But you didn't.
- We would've done, sir...

21
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,390
You were to head them off.
Clear orders to block their way. They were done.

22
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,830
They'd have surrendered.
Hundreds of prisoners.

23
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,870
Did you take money?

24
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,990
- What's he saying?
- Were you paid to do it?

25
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,540
I was not, sir.

26
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,590
The only money I'd take off a Frenchman
is like this.

27
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,630
Wait for me!

28
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,590
REDCOAT: Come on! Come on!

29
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,630
They were saving themselves.

30
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,260
Well, you know, dead men gather no loot.

31
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,150
Brave soldiers of the South Essex Regiment.

32
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,190
Get your men together, Sergeant,

33
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,510
we're going back to camp.

34
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,030
No, sir.

35
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,030
- What did you say?
- I refuse your orders.

36
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,750
- You shouldn't have done that.
- You took the king's shilling, Sergeant.

37
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,710
He can have it back!
I were no bigger than him there.

38
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,230
This is better. I've got lots more stashed.
We all have.

39
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,270
So no more orders, Sharpe.

40
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,510
- Major Sharpe.
- Not from you, Sharpe,

41
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,550
nor no bugger else.

42
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,670
- We're off, ain't we?
REDCOATS: Yes!

43
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,630
- The provosts'll get ye.
- We'll be off where they can't.

44
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,670
With the wild fellas in the hills.

45
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,830
- They'll sell us women, grub and booze.
REDCOAT: Yeah!

46
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,220
So bugger the King and his shilling!

47
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,310
- (Redcoats cheer)
- It's your last chance.

48
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,990
I think it's your last chance to join us.

49
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,030
Look at your men, Sharpe.

50
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,070
The whole, horrible dirty bunch.

51
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,070
Look at him there,

52
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,110
the scaly licking his chops.

53
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,790
Sergeant Rodd.

54
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,670
Private Rodd.

55
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,430
Deserter Rodd.

56
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,430
SHARPE: When the provosts catch you.
It'll be 200 hashes.

57
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,470
And then you'll hang.

58
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,940
Anybody?

59
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,510
(Redcoat sniggers)

60
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,030
REDCOAT: Look at that. Look at that.

61
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,070
Ooh, look at that.

62
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,110
Cor, look at this.

63
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,230
HAGMAN: I am a deserter

64
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,620
And this I shall say

65
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,020
The generals they thrive

66
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,950
While the men rot away

67
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,470
They sit drinking fine liquor

68
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,910
And brandy and all

69
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,950
Whilst we to the front

70
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,270
And like good soldiers fall

71
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,310
- I hate that song.
- Oh, aye?

72
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,310
- What's up wi' it?
- It's on the side of the deserters.

73
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,030
It's only a song, lad.

74
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,350
- Do you think the provosts'll really catch them?
- They catch a lot of them.

75
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,270
- The provosts are muck.
- Private Skillicon! (Tuts)

76
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,910
No, no, they are. They're thief-takers,
so that makes them thieves themselves.

77
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,870
Skillicon doesn't say much,
but when he does you have to listen.

78
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,630
Sing that song again.

79
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,750
Oh, Private Skillicon

80
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,390
Hark to his fame

81
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,150
Ha ha!

82
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,910
Provosts all run at the sound of his name

83
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,830
So come all you bold chickens

84
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,870
And you guinea cock fowl

85
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,270
You'd best watch your feathers

86
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,590
Skillicon's on the prowl

87
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,060
That'll do it now, lads.

88
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,110
(Chickens clucking)

89
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,470
I can hear dinner.

90
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,310
(Horse whinnies)

91
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,470
Good day. I take it you're provosts.

92
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,910
And what do you claim to be?

93
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,630
Riflemen.

94
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,750
Half your equipment's French.

95
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,950
It's better.

96
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,790
What on earth's that?

97
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,590
It's a seven-barreled volley gun.

98
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,630
Made by Mr. Nock of London.

99
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,790
I gave it to him.
He's the only one that can handle it.

100
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,590
And you are?

101
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,060
Major Sharpe. South Essex.

102
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,110
And you?

103
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,510
Lieutenant Ayres... sir.

104
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,750
Provosts catching looters, eh?

105
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,550
Yes, sir.

106
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,470
Brave work

107
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,430
Better than fighting.

108
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,190
AYRES: Soldier.
- Wait a minute.

109
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,510
AYRES: What the hell are you doing?
- They haven't gone.

110
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,390
Who's missing?

111
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,750
On. Lease. Lease.

112
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,060
Oh, Skillicon!

113
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,550
- This one of your men?
- I'll deal with him, Lieutenant.

114
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,670
No, you won't. He's going to hang.

115
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,830
- Sir, it's a wild chicken. Just a wild thing.
AYRES: Wild?

116
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,910
Nobody lives here. It's deserted.

117
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,950
He's a looter.

118
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,790
Hang him!

119
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,830
I'll tell you where there's looters...

120
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,470
Stop!

121
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,550
You're not going to hang him.

122
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,710
Oh, yes. And you will watch it.

123
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,750
Let him go, Lieutenant.

124
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,510
- Are you mad?
- I said let him go!

125
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,750
Have your thief, Major.

126
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,350
He took my chicken.

127
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,470
You stupid bastard.

128
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,720
- Why did he hit me?
- If he hadn't, I would have.

129
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,430
You've landed him in the shite. Grab your rifle.

130
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,470
Go on, grab your rifle.

131
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,510
You'll be lucky to save your neck.

132
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,230
(Redcoat shouts orders)

133
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,380
SOLDIER: Come on, lads.
Come along. Come on.

134
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,870
Richard Sharpe.

135
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,790
Major Munro.

136
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,110
Now, you've not to enquire what I've been doing
since we last met because it's secret, as usual.

137
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,830
And I shan't enquire what you've been doing
because I know already.

138
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,310
You're in black trouble, laddie.

139
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,830
- How bad is it?
- I could use words like "dire" and "dreadful",

140
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,190
but that’d cheer you up
Major Sharpe, sir?

141
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,630
His Lordship will see you now.

142
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,550
I won't bloody apologize.

143
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,590
If it's an order, you will.

144
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,510
You'll grovel, cringe, squirm and toady
to Lieutenant Ayres.

145
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,160
He screamed his head off to the provost marshal

146
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,110
and the provost marshal screamed his head off
to my lord.

147
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,670
Major Sharpe.

148
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,830
- Sir.
- Did you threaten Lieutenant Ayres with a rifle?

149
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,750
Yes, sir.

150
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,110
Some years ago, you saved my life.

151
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,310
I was glad to, sir.

152
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,350
I shouldn't like to think
you'd trade on my support.

153
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,350
Never, sir.

154
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,350
Evidences for impending courts martial.

155
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,390
Four score of them for my attention.

156
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,750
Am h to add another?

157
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,870
If you must, sir.

158
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,150
I often envy Napoleon, do I not, Munro?

159
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,670
You're wrong. He's losing, you're winning.

160
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,750
Still, he has the Imperial Guard
and disciplined soldiers.

161
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,510
I have the scum of the Earth.

162
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,350
They fight well, sir.

163
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,510
Oh, yes - thieves, drunkards, jailbirds.
I've drilled them into heroes.

164
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,790
But when the battle's done,
they turn back into drunken vagabonds.

165
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,470
They rape. Plunder. And run.

166
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,270
Not all, sir.

167
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,390
- Yours just kill wild chickens.
- And now I'm to invade France with them.

168
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,990
Well, I'll line the roads with provosts
to keep them in order.

169
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,030
Provosts Major Sharpe

170
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,950
For any infraction, to hang them on the spot.

171
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,750
And if any man defies my provosts,
or, worse still, should turn a gun on one...

172
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,670
Apologize to Lieutenant Ayres.

173
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,310
Very good, sir.

174
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,910
He's waiting.

175
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,150
Disgraceful, Sharpe. Disgraceful.

176
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,800
All I have to say, and in particular to you, sir,

177
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,910
the Provost Marshal,
is that my behavior was utterly inexcusable.

178
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,950
I imperiled Ayres' authority
And overstepped my own.

179
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,420
I apologize

180
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,820
Oh, you do?

181
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,870
Yes, sir. Unreservedly, sir.

182
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,190
I very much regret my part in it, sir.

183
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,470
As I'm sure Lieutenant Ayres does his.

184
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,190
I do, sir. Yes, I do.

185
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,560
What have you got to regret in this, Ayres, eh?

186
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,950
Is there more to this than meets the er...

187
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,550
Gentlemen, I'm sure honor is now satisfied.

188
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,910
- Feel better?
- Shamed.

189
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,550
- I'd not go through it again.
- You were lucky, man.

190
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,910
His Lordship wanted you chopped up in bits.
Did you not notice?

191
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,470
- Was it enough?
- For what?

192
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,030
France. When it happens,
I want to be in it, not stuck in some...

193
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,950
As the Lord disposes.
The one above, not him in Headquarters.

194
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,990
I can't pray.

195
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,870
Washed in the blood of the Lamb, ye should be,
not just the blood of the French.

196
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,750
- Where are we?
- Eh, sarge, know the way?

197
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,790
Sarge?

198
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,830
Do you know the way, or what?

199
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,070
Which way now, then, sarge?

200
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,390
If we keep the sun on our back s
during the heat of the day...

201
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,630
- We bloody die.
...we'll be going north.

202
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,670
Keep that on!

203
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,790
- Why, sarge?
- We don't want them to think we're frogs.

204
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,950
- Who?
- Anyone we run across.

205
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,600
But if it's provosts, they'll have us spotted.

206
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,750
- That's right.
- Nah, the provosts don't come this far.

207
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,510
All right, lads.

208
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,550
RODD: Act friendly.

209
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,710
Er...

210
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,550
Buenas tardes, amigo.

211
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,590
Amigos. Inglés.

212
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,710
You talk English?

213
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,670
Sarge...

214
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,060
RODD: Drop your guns. Drop 'em.

215
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,550
Amigo...

216
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,110
Si, amigo.

217
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,870
Say we want food.

218
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,190
Er... coma,

219
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,230
por favor.

220
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,630
And water.

221
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,510
Agua.

222
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,750
Casco

223
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,590
Oh, my God.

224
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,910
Dorme, dorme, mio Patrizio

225
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,030
Que tu mamá ya va bien

226
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,030
- I've done nothing. I've done nothing.
- Sergeant!

227
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,790
SKILLICON: They'll hang me.

228
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,830
What's going on here? Sir?

229
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,750
- I'm arresting him for looting.
- Does Major Sharpe know?

230
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,790
This doesn't concern him. Nor you.

231
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,140
- Bring him away.
- No! No!

232
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,830
- Lads, they'll hang me!
- Have they the right?

233
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,350
- He was asleep, sarge.
- Find Major Sharpe.

234
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,390
This time they'll hang him, surely.

235
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,470
- But Sharpe...
- It's for Mr. Sharpe. Don't you see?

236
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,510
(Somber drumming)

237
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,750
HARPER: Poor Skillicorn...

238
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,590
- Will they really do it?
- I've seen the gallows.

239
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,870
This is not for my baby.

240
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,590
HARPER: He's bloody useless. But...

241
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,630
- He's one of mine.
- No, don't.

242
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,910
It'd just suit them.

243
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,550
I don't like to watch death agonies
deliberately imposed.

244
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,150
PROVOST MARSHAL: Ht's for the example.
- He stole a chicken.

245
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,350
One chicken, ten thousand chickens.
The crime is the same.

246
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,710
In a short time, sir,
you will lead your army into France.

247
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,190
I need hardly remind you...

248
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,150
- Indeed you need not.
- A hostile population.

249
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,800
Any excuse to rise savagely.

250
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,830
I take your point.

251
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,350
I took it a long time ago, without your help.

252
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,700
I'm corrected, my lord.

253
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,830
I should mention, sir, that the provosts
have recovered many deserters.

254
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,590
A figure of 237

255
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,870
- in the past week...
- 242.

256
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,870
Good.

257
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,270
Punishment?

258
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,510
For now, just hold them in detention.

259
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,030
Very good, my lord.

260
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,270
He'd string up my whole army.

261
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,670
Aye, well, sir, he's bitter against sin.

262
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,790
When we go into France, Munro, it must be
to liberate it from a wicked regime.

263
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,230
- I believe that profoundly.
- Aye, but will the French believe it?

264
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,470
When they learn we are not come
to rape, steal and pillage.

265
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,630
And when will that be... sir?

266
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,790
(Soldiers mutter)

267
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,790
SOLDIER: Did you see that?

268
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,430
WOMAN: Is it in there he is?

269
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,470
Somebody say.

270
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,060
Bess?

271
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,110
Oh!

272
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,150
Oh, Arthur!

273
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,190
This is my cousin - Mrs. Nugent.

274
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,670
- How on earth did you get here?
- You mean, all the way from Ireland?

275
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,630
On a boat. What else?

276
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,830
And we found a man to show us the way.
Where's he got to?

277
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,870
And...

278
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,990
You know who this is, don't you?

279
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,750
Grown up a lot. Still my baby.

280
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,310
Ellie?

281
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,350
Cousin Arthur!

282
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,910
Er... you'd best come inside
and explain yourselves. Leave the rifles.

283
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,150
- Oh, they're not loaded.
WELLINGTON: See to the horses.

284
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,070
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

285
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,550
Well, I've never seen him sweat like that before.

286
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,390
- Poor old Nosey.
- I weren't looking at him.

287
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,430
I was looking at the young lady.

288
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,470
- Lovely.
- Mm.

289
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,110
Mm!

290
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,750
- Try this chair, miss.
- A cushion.

291
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,110
- Thank you.
- Perhaps something to drink. Some lemonade?

292
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,270
That would be a blessing. I'm parched.

293
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,830
And then you'll want to get on with your war.
Shove us in a tent or something.

294
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,150
Bess, why are you here?

295
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,190
- Uh?
- Dada.

296
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,910
Will. My husband, Will Nugent.
We've come to find him.

297
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,630
Er... he wrote to me.

298
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,670
And you got him his commission.

299
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,750
Oh, Dada was so pleased.

300
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,030
I'm afraid I don't quite er...

301
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,790
Perhaps after Madrid?
There were so many changes.

302
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,910
Ah, yes, yes, I do recollect.
He was directed to the preparation of maps.

303
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,590
And... er... yes. Quite an artist, old Will.

304
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,590
Always was. And now?

305
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,470
We think he might be lost.

306
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,790
This is war, madam.

307
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,830
Not killed lost.

308
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,550
- Sort of... mislaid.
- We had a letter from him.

309
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,150
MUNRO: How on earth did he manage it?

310
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,150
It's mostly enquiring about the dogs, but...

311
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,950
Oh, but... there's stuff here. Look.

312
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,590
Rumors about a vast hoard of treasure
somewhere in these hills.

313
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,990
- Typical Dada.
- (Bess giggles) When he gets the notion...

314
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,870
Bess, what is it that you want me to do?

315
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,910
To mount a search for him?

316
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,630
Well...

317
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,550
I'm about to order the invasion of France.

318
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,740
To suspend it while we find Will Nugent would be
interesting but might be criticized in London.

319
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,260
- You mean you won't help?
- Cousin Arthur...

320
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,310
we've come all this way.

321
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,100
And now you're going all the way back.
Both of you.

322
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,760
As soon as it can be arranged.

323
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,070
But tonight... you shall be my guests.

324
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,950
Oh, Ma, look at my dress.
It's all squashed to bits.

325
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,990
I can't wear this.

326
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,910
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Can you do something with it?

327
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,950
Sí, señora.

328
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,990
Give her these, too - my petticoats.

329
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,430
- Could you do these as well? Thanks.
- Por supuesto.

330
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,910
Miss Nugent.

331
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,300
- Yes.
- Major Richard Sharpe.

332
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,920
Are these your rifles? We've had them cleaned.

333
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,150
- Oh, there was no need.
- I think there was, miss.

334
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,190
I mean, no hurry.

335
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,590
Unless to put a bullet through cousin Arthur.
The General.

336
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,630
He's kicking us out.

337
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,630
You traveled here alone?

338
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,150
Just a guide and a servant.

339
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,990
I'm glad you had these.

340
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,990
They're American. Made in Pennsylvania.

341
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,110
- None better.
- Speaking as a rifleman.

342
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,550
- Yes, miss.
- (Laughs)

343
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,180
I'll see you tonight, at my cousin's party.

344
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,900
- Doubt it, miss.
- Are you on duty?

345
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,470
I er... I'm not exactly in his favor at the moment.

346
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,510
Ah, well...

347
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,710
You're like me.

348
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,630
You could come as my escort, Major Sharpe.
Will you?

349
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,830
- Well, I er...
- We could talk about guns.

350
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,190
(Bess laughs) He's so funny!

351
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,790
(Laughter)

352
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,270
Don't worry, my dear, you'll travel back
under proper protection. More port here.

353
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,390
I Can’t spare any provosts, my lord.

354
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,510
- There's no need. I'll send some older men.
- How old?

355
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,070
On their way to discharge,
so they don't pester young Ellie.

356
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,990
But, Miss Nugent,
suppose you had run into trouble?

357
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,390
- She'd have seen them off.
- With that Yankee popgun?

358
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,430
Coon gun, that's what they call 'em.

359
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,350
Tiny little bullets.

360
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,350
But deadly accurate.

361
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,680
You were lucky, ma'am.
Two females on your own.

362
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,790
- If you'd run into any Frenchmen...
- Or guerrillas...

363
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,870
Even worse - savages.

364
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,950
I've found French soldiers
they'd nailed to doors alive.

365
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,110
Our horses are very fleet.

366
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,470
So are theirs.

367
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,710
She's a lady,
which is why she's got a lady's gun.

368
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,790
Which is a rifle.
What about that, Major Rifleman Sharpe?

369
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,790
You're drunk, Mr. Ayres.

370
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,830
So should you be by now.

371
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,350
And I stick by muskets.

372
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,830
Ayres.

373
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,500
Back in Ireland, I go shooting quite a lot.

374
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,470
With a lady's gun.

375
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,950
Just as well I'm a lady, Lieutenant.

376
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,660
What sort of game?

377
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,430
Mostly rabbits.

378
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,190
Rabbits!

379
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,350
I can knock the head off 'em every time.

380
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,710
If it comes close enough.

381
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,750
Come here, little bunny rabbit,
look down the spout.

382
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,790
Every time.

383
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,190
- At 100-yard range.
- She never misses.

384
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,270
Better be careful, Mr. Ayres.

385
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,630
I smell a wager.

386
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,280
(All chant) A wager! A wager! A wager!

387
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,870
A wager. A wager. A wager. A wager.

388
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,120
- Is he truly your best man?
- He surely is.

389
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,830
That man could shoot a pimple off your nose
without breaking the skin.

390
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,430
Will you run the book, sir?

391
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,510
I will not.

392
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,380
This is sinful gambling and I'll have no part of it.

393
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,430
I'm here to see fair play.

394
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,820
It is only sinful, sir, when you lose.

395
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,540
- I'll make the book.
- Ahn. Well said.

396
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,590
Put two shillings down.

397
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,390
Put me down for 20 guineas.

398
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,550
Miss Nugent, to make up for last night -

399
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,870
I was a bit bosky -

400
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,910
I lay 50 guineas on you.

401
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,950
Sergeant, 50 on the girl.

402
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,910
You have it.

403
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,380
MAN: Ten guineas on Miss Nugent, please...

404
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,430
How about you, Major?
Will you match me in guineas?

405
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,460
- No.
- That's the way, laddie.

406
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,510
Set them an example.

407
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,550
Then you're free to shoot.

408
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,390
Go on, Major. Instead of this scruffy creature,
prove yourself.

409
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,630
Not who's going to win,
but who's going to lose, eh, Major?

410
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,030
Good luck, sir.

411
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,190
- Scruffy creature!
- Clean yourself up.

412
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,910
MUNRO: Change of contestant.

413
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,950
MUNRO: Take your positions, both.

414
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,990
I like to lie flat.

415
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,150
COOPER: Crikey, just look at her, will you?

416
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,830
(Whispers) Sharpe.

417
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,750
Ten shots apiece. Fire in your own time.

418
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,470
Targets set at 800 yards.

419
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,270
Miss Nugent, bull at four o'clock.

420
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,110
God save Ireland.

421
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,470
Major Sharpe. Bull at two.

422
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,750
- That'll do.
- She'll better that, just wait.

423
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,270
Miss Nugent, dead center.

424
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,470
Yess! Major j

425
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,510
you're off-center at five.

426
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,710
Dammit, I should have wagered a hundred.

427
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,550
- The book's still open, sir.
- Right, then, raise it.

428
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,870
An even hundred you have, sir.

429
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,950
Major, center...

430
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,750
four.

431
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,750
Miss Nugent... another bull.

432
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,590
(Laughter)

433
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,590
Miss Nugent, bull's-eye again.

434
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,550
When Arthur hears of this,
he'll want you in his army.

435
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,350
Oh, be quiet, Ma.

436
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,270
Major Sharpe, also bull's-eye.

437
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,390
Miss Nugent. Center at seven.
Major. Center... bull.

438
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,150
Major Sharpe. Bull's-eye.
Miss Nugent. Bull at ten.

439
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,430
Number nine coming up.

440
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,190
Miss Nugent... bull's-eye.

441
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,390
Major... a bull.

442
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,990
Last shots. Contestants... all square.

443
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,910
Miss Nugent, bull's-eye.

444
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,590
Ah, no... no, not quite.

445
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,430
Center... nine o'clock.

446
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,910
Major Sharpe...

447
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,190
miss.

448
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,110
- Bravo!
RIFLEMEN: Miss?

449
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,150
HAGMAN: Aye. Miss.

450
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,670
Oh, shite.

451
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,660
Damn. Damn. Damn.

452
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,110
Bad luck, sir. Take another shot?

453
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,990
Well, my lucky day.

454
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,670
Oh, well done, Ellie. Great match.

455
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,870
Congratulations.

456
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,270
Did you not forget this?

457
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,310
- Look, Miss Nugent...
- Ellie.

458
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,990
Go on, shoot.

459
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,870
Hold everything.

460
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,910
All bets still stand.

461
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:06,500
HAGMAN: At Miss Nugent's request.
Major Sharpe is to refire.

462
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,830
Center, bull's-eye.

463
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,910
Center shot takes the match.

464
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,830
(Ellie chuckles)

465
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,990
Oh... I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
Your hundred guin... (Laughs)

466
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,110
REDCOAT: Where do you want them, Corporal?
- Over there.

467
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,030
Mind out the way. On the double.
Get these on top.

468
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,310
Mad for the drink, so he is.

469
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,740
Swills it down like a tinker on a fair day.

470
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,750
Don't you, hm?

471
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,510
- Would you like to hold him, ma'am?
BESS: Oh!

472
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,500
Oh, he's beautiful.

473
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,550
He's not just any old baby, ma'am.

474
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,390
- He can comprehend five languages.
- (Bess hums)

475
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,950
Can march 50 miles a day,
can strangle wild beasts,

476
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,470
- play a bugle with one hand behind his back.
- Harris.

477
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,510
I think he's just fine the way he is.

478
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,590
- (Baby whimpers)
- (Bess hums)

479
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,630
May I?

480
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,670
(Baby whimpers)

481
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,710
Shh. Shh.

482
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,020
Guard! My lord's tent.
Guard of Honor, at the double!

483
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,070
(Shouting)

484
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,590
- What's going on?
- No idea.

485
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,300
HARPER: To do with the big offensive. Maybe.
SHARPE: Maybe.

486
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,350
Or maybe not.

487
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,630
HARPER: Jeez., he's a queer hat on him.

488
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,990
It's what's under the hat.

489
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,030
HARPER: Any notion who he is?

490
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,070
SHARPE: They call him Eh Casco.

491
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,110
What rumor says about him...

492
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,430
I never put much faith in rumors.

493
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,230
In this country, Pat, rumor's always right.

494
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,310
I told him you know of his reputation

495
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,310
as a powerful leader of partisans,
feared by the French.

496
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,670
So much so that they will not enter his territory.

497
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,190
Que temen tanto que no entran en su territorio.

498
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,060
What exactly is his territory?

499
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,430
Where?

500
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,430
Cuál es exactamente su territorio? Dónde?

501
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,430
Lejos. En las montañnas.

502
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,470
In the far hills.

503
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,350
That's all he'll say. Sir.

504
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,230
Yo no mato ingleses.

505
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,270
I do not kill Englishmen.

506
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,910
Well...

507
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,510
that's a relief.

508
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,550
Not for the Scots.

509
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,910
Solo los capturo cuando huyen de usted.

510
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,310
He takes our men when they run away.
I think he means deserters.

511
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,830
Ah. How many?

512
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,870
- Cuántos?
- Cincuenta y dos.

513
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,630
He's got 52.

514
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,150
So, what does he propose?

515
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,190
Is he going to turn them in?

516
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,230
I fancy not. Nothing so simple.

517
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,700
Qué propone?

518
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,750
Se los entregaré.

519
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,790
A cambio de armas.

520
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,830
He wants to trade them for guns.

521
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,380
I thought we should come to that.

522
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,350
Baker... rifles.

523
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,230
Do you know what Baker rifles are?

524
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,830
- They're in use with my rifle regiments.
- Baker rifle.

525
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,550
How many?

526
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,590
- Cincuenta.
MUNRO: Have you got that? 50.

527
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,240
That's about one gun per deserter.

528
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,950
Would ye contemplate it?

529
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,990
Oh, yes.

530
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,030
I can spare the guns.

531
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,550
And it'll help these fellows
to damage the French.

532
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,590
- Damage?
- Look at the eyes, Munro.

533
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,630
Besides, I want those deserters.

534
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,990
This breastplate must be three centuries old
at least.

535
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,710
He must have looted a museum.

536
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,580
Make the arrangements, Munro.

537
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,910
(Soldier shouts orders)

538
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,990
Major Sharpe, sir?

539
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,430
- What is it?
- Compliments of my lord, sir.

540
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,470
Will you attend upon him forthwith?

541
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,470
- Is this an order, sir?
- Well, of course. You have some objection to it?

542
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,230
I'd hoped to retain my present command
for the invasion of France, sir.

543
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,390
- (Sneers)
- Outrageous. You want to take your pick?!

544
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,190
No, sir. Just do my duty, sir.

545
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,350
Which is as I've just described to you.

546
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,790
Exchange of rifles for deserters. Understood?

547
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,310
Yes, sir.

548
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,350
Where's the rendezvous, sir?

549
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,790
We don't quite know yet.

550
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,620
MUNRO: It'll be worked out stage by stage...

551
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,470
In secret.

552
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,550
This um... El... what? Casco.

553
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,350
- Hm?
- If he does produce the deserters. Then what?

554
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,030
- We'll look after them, sir.
- Oh, no.

555
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,070
Oh, no, you will not.

556
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,780
That's the duty of my provosts,
under an officer of mine.

557
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,180
Any suggestion who that might be, sir?

558
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,910
- What?
SHARPE: Is he listening outside. Sir?

559
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,470
COME IN!

560
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,310
Sir.

561
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,140
HAGMAN: If anybody wants to know my name

562
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,670
My name it is young Johnson

563
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,110
I have my orders from the King

564
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,470
To court all the girls that are handsome

565
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,510
To court them all, both old and young...

566
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,310
I haven't brought my men.
They won't be needed, will they?

567
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,430
They've got no duties here, Mr. Ayres.

568
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,710
Are you nearly done?

569
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,750
That's for me to say.

570
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,430
Carry on, lads.

571
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,350
AYRES: Why do they stare so?

572
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,390
(Chuckles)

573
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,430
You hanged one of them, Mr. Ayres.

574
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,630
You might do it again.

575
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,670
You're a man to watch.

576
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,910
A word.

577
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,590
We shall be the only two officers.
We can't have enmity between us.

578
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,270
Can we not?

579
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,710
- It's hard to talk to you.
- It's quite easy.

580
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,750
Just start like this:

581
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,750
"Major Sharpe, I believe you are ignorant

582
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,870
and illegitimate and wounded all over,
but I forgive you.

583
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,710
My daddy's rich and fiddled me
into the Bow Street runners - oh, sorry, provosts.

584
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,710
So I'm a nice person."

585
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,870
They say you saved Wellington's life.

586
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,260
Do they? You don't have to believe it.

587
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,590
- And captured a French Eagle.
- You needn't believe that either.

588
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,670
Isn't it true?

589
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,590
We're going to dangerous places, Mr. Ayres.

590
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,060
A horse can slip and go over a cliff.

591
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,830
- And when you do...
- Let me go.

592
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,670
Go and tell your tales again.

593
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,070
Major Sharpe, I offered you my hand.
We should put things behind us.

594
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,390
Set out in good will,
a cheerful parting from our friends.

595
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,120
- And Ellie.
- Ellie?

596
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,660
Have you told her yet?

597
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,030
The man you hanged...

598
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,030
the man who stole a chicken...

599
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,510
I punished him myself... like this.

600
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,550
That should've been enough for him.

601
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,590
Is it enough for you?

602
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,390
Then here's my hand... just as you wanted.

603
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,070
Smooth.

604
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,110
Very, very smooth.

605
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,150
Lovely finish. Try it.

606
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,030
This one's a beauty.

607
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,070
See? Can I trade it for mine?

608
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:31,150
SERGEANT: Come on. We haven't got
much time. Get those horses loaded up.

609
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,780
SOLDIER: Yes. Sergeant.
SERGEANT: Hewitt. Give him a hand.

610
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,830
Ma, look at this.

611
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,950
Excuse me, excuse me. What is happening?

612
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,390
That'd be a bit of a secret, ma'am.

613
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,430
You're under orders?

614
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,120
BESS: Sergeant. Perhaps you can help me?

615
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,740
Where are you going?
Are you allowed to tell us?

616
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,790
Over the hills.

617
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,030
The fact is, we don't know ourselves yet, ma'am.

618
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,390
Oh, Major Sharpe.

619
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,310
- I was just about to say goodbye
- Nobody else is going. Is it only...

620
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,230
Just us.
A sort of special mission, all of a sudden.

621
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,910
Into the hills?

622
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,150
Mrs. Nugent,
I shouldn't really be talking to you about this.

623
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,020
- Well, I just want to know...
- Anyway, you'll be gone when we get back.

624
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,390
Maybe you could look in
on Ramona and the baby when I've gone.

625
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,430
Yes, we will. Won't we, Ma?

626
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,630
Ma.

627
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,280
If I don't find you here...

628
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,590
Would you come to Ireland and find me there?

629
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,470
Never mind me. Just come back.

630
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:09,270
- Suppose the French did try it?
- A counterattack through there? Impossible.

631
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,310
- Marshal Soult's a fine, mad officer. He might.
BESS: Let me see my cousin.

632
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,710
GUARD: You can't go in.

633
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,260
- Will you take your hands off me?
- Madam!

634
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,790
Does blood mean nothing to you?

635
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,230
Blood?

636
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:26,390
For the Lord's sake. I'm your kin,
come all this way to throw myself upon you,

637
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,150
- to seek help.
- You burst in...

638
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,790
And you've mounted an expedition to go
exploring in the hills without a word to me.

639
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,070
- Expedition?
- Major Sharpe is ready to leave.

640
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,430
Now, Bess. That's nothing to do with...

641
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,470
You may have no concern for Willie Nugent,
but my husband is a fine man.

642
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,230
- He deserves a great deal from us.
- Calm yourself.

643
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,150
For God's sake. There's enough black sheep
in our family to fill a field.

644
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,870
Whoring and swindling and...

645
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,910
But Will isn't one of them.
And as for your wife, Kitty,

646
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,750
- and her tribe...
- Bess, what is this for?

647
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,660
Let me go too. To find him.

648
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,910
No. You will not.

649
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,560
You will be removed from here tomorrow,

650
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,590
in the opposite direction,

651
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,310
disarmed and obedient.

652
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,470
Show this lady out.

653
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,710
- He's very quiet.
- What?

654
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,550
Your man, Lieutenant Ayres. He's very quiet.

655
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,830
Well... I just had to er... explain a few things.

656
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:43,780
Oh, right. There's nothing like a little bit
of explanation to promote understanding.

657
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:48,110
I remember having to explain something
to a fella in Ballyshannon once.

658
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,510
You know... I nearly half killed him.

659
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,550
HAGMAN: Sir!

660
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,430
Sir, we're being trailed. About a mile back.

661
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,470
- French?
- I couldn't make out.

662
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,510
Rifles, make ready!

663
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,670
My God, it's them. It's the women.

664
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,320
Rifles... stand easy.

665
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,270
Stand easy.

666
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,940
Major Sharpe, we're joining you.

667
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,910
- But I thought Lord Wellington...
- I talked him around.

668
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,990
Look, you just can't...

669
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,350
SHARPE: I need a written order.
- We have one.

670
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,630
I’d better see it
BESS: Of course...

671
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,670
You have it, Ellie.

672
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,840
No, you have it. I saw you pack it.

673
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,030
ELLIE: I think. Um... wait a minute.

674
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,430
(Sighs) Oh. Oh, no. I think I've left it in the tent.

675
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,980
ELLIE: I'm sorry.

676
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,550
I wish you hadn't done this.

677
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,550
We won't be a burden.

678
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,350
There'll be danger.

679
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,630
We can look after ourselves.

680
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,670
Aye.

681
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,750
But there's danger you can face up to
and danger of another kind.

682
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,590
I've smelt it once or twice.

683
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,430
It's rank. It's wretched.

684
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,670
And it's not of this world.

685
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,670
Sergeant Harper's a religious man.

686
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,230
- He'd have a word for it.
- You mean evil?

687
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,110
Something...

688
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,150
Something very wrong.

689
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,190
You're trying to scare us.

690
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,070
Well, you can't.

691
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,910
BESS: We'll go alone.
- Ellie...

692
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,990
We'll find Dada.

693
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,630
When first I deserted

694
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,100
I thought myself free

695
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,920
But the provosts they caught me

696
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,910
And hanged I shall be

697
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,150
So take heed of my fate

698
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,990
Less yourself you might see

699
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:29,830
For now the king's duty lies heavy on me

700
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,270
Miss Nugent.

701
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,310
Forgive my curiosity.

702
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,470
I'd like to hear about Dublin society.

703
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,150
He wants to know if we're really in it, Ma.

704
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,950
Well, yes, we are. Such as it is.

705
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,150
We're Anglos. Not like the real thing.
Unlike the sergeant here.

706
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,950
ELLIE: He's a real Paddy.

707
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,950
Oh, I'm a real Paddy, all right.

708
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,870
A Paddy who dreams of an Irish Ireland.
Free from outside influences.

709
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,070
Thank you, Sergeant.

710
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,270
But I fear it takes a war
to bring a man to his senses.

711
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,470
You know, I should be at home,
minding the cabbages.

712
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,750
- That'll do.
SHARPE: Forget society. Just watch the French.

713
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,140
- What do you mean?
- Look to the left.

714
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,230
AYRES: I see.
ELLIE: Just three.

715
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,390
- No, four.
SHARPE: So. Be ready.

716
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:21,150
And be calm.
And we'll head towards those trees.

717
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,590
- (Horse whinnies)
- I said calm, Ayres.

718
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,790
Here they come!

719
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,590
(Shouting)

720
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,990
Get back!

721
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,950
MAN: Get in the trees!

722
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,230
Sabers, vite!

723
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,830
Avance.

724
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,270
- Stay back, ladies!
- No fear.

725
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,310
Chargez!

726
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,830
MAN: Are the horses all right?

727
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,750
Are you all right?

728
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,470
SHARPE: My God. You did well.

729
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,510
She saved me.

730
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,510
A clean shot.

731
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,790
He's so young.

732
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,830
He's a boy.

733
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,190
SHARPE: They all are. Conscripts.

734
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,390
- Half trained.
HARPER: Cooper's hurt.

735
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,430
It's not too bad.

736
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,820
Would you have a look at him?
A woman's touch.

737
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,540
- Are you all right, Mr. Harper?
- Oh, I'm fine. It's only a scratch.

738
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,350
Bugger.

739
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,750
- (Cooper sighs)
- Well. Mr. Ayres.

740
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,790
How shall we report this?

741
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,950
A skilled defense or a valiant action?

742
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,990
I'm not very experienced.

743
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,550
First rule - always get a girl
between you and the enemy.

744
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,950
I killed him.

745
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,070
I never...

746
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,110
I never did that.

747
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,070
Not a sign.

748
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,110
They've quit.

749
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,430
Where's Ellie?

750
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,150
Ellie?

751
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,510
You proved yourself.

752
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,350
No.

753
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,390
That's when a woman has a child...

754
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,390
...and she's made a new life.

755
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,350
- Yes, I know.
- But if she takes a life... it's wrong.

756
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,750
Do you see? It's wrong.

757
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,790
Oh, God.

758
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,230
(Sobs)

759
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,590
(Ellie pants)

760
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,470
AYRES: Major Sharpe.

761
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,430
There's something I ought to say.

762
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,390
- I feel it my duty to...
- Yes?

763
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,590
...make sure we're heading the right way.

764
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,070
We are. That all?

765
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,470
Yes.

766
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,190
I saw you with Major Sharpe.

767
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,790
Oh, yes?

768
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,150
Would you marry him? That's the question.

769
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,430
Oh, Ma, it wasn't...

770
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,470
I just needed him then.

771
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,630
- More than your mother?
- Yes.

772
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,180
Something five or six miles away.
Look s like a tower.

773
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,430
Ayres, those bloody men of yours.
Get them to help - and the same goes for you.

774
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,710
There it is.

775
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,790
SHARPE: The watchtower.

776
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,070
Look. Over yonder, sir.

777
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,830
- Had trouble, Sharpe?
- We met a few French.

778
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,870
Aye, I saw.

779
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,070
And I saw these ladies.

780
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,670
I got my cousin's permission.

781
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,430
Aye? Not while I was there.

782
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,820
Later.

783
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,190
His lordship must be growing
more persuadable.

784
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,190
Now, we must prepare for our guest.

785
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,470
(Thunder rumbles)

786
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:21,630
Now, Mrs. Nugent, I wish most profoundly
that you were not here. Nor you, Ellie.

787
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,070
I came to find my husband.

788
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,110
A needle in a haystack, ma'am.

789
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,630
- And it's rotten hay.
- I tried to tell them.

790
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:35,190
I've been finding out more. Guerrillas
come in all kinds, we make use of them.

791
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,230
Now these…

792
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,910
Out there, in their hills, they have no god.

793
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,460
- They have something else.
- They're heathen?

794
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,470
Ah.

795
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:53,790
The story goes: There was a great shipwreck
hereabouts - long, long ago.

796
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,310
A galleon

797
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,830
bearing treasure from Mexico
to the King of Spain.

798
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,620
Not only gold, but idols for him to see.

799
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,750
Even people

800
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,990
- from that terrible hand.
- Treasure?

801
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,030
Oh, that catches your ear, laddie.

802
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,430
Well, if it's still there, nobody's found it yet.

803
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,830
- Will heard of it, too.
- You said... a terrible land.

804
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:25,110
The Aztecs of Mexico were a high civilization
and entirely evil.

805
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,630
How could that be?

806
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,870
Their religion was based on human sacrifice.

807
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,310
They cut the living hearts

808
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,550
- from their prisoners.
MUNRO: That'll do.

809
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,990
AYRES: Thousands.

810
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:39,190
- Or they skinned them.
- I said that'll do.

811
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,870
They even had a god of flaying.

812
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,110
Xipe Totec. The Flayed God.

813
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,630
Stop gloating.

814
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,590
I came across it in my studies.

815
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,590
Rather amusing.

816
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,790
Major Munro, you didn't mean
there could be anything of that here?

817
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,830
Tush, no.

818
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,030
Well... maybe a taint...

819
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,110
turned into foolish nonsense.

820
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,760
- These folk are peasants.
- And that's all?

821
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,230
I'll maybe set a few braw missionaries on them...

822
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,270
- when I've the time.
- (Rustling)

823
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,230
- He's coming up now, sir.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

824
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,470
- Out of sight, ladies. Go with the sergeant.
- No. I want to see this fellow...

825
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,190
- Do as I say.
...question him.

826
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,870
- If he'd ever come across Dada...
- I insist.

827
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,430
He's alone.

828
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,070
(Horse hooves)

829
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,550
Buenas noches, señor.

830
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,950
Tiene los rifles?

831
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,190
Dentro de dos días, haremos el cambio.

832
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,430
The exchange takes place in two days' time.

833
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,430
We'll be there.

834
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,310
- Oh, ask him, please.
- Quiet.

835
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,790
Señor... señor...

836
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,830
Por favor...

837
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,270
Perdóne me...

838
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,900
Have you seen my husband?

839
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,300
Un inglés.

840
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,310
Capitano Will Nugent.

841
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,790
EL CASCO: Un mensaje francés.

842
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,310
El mensajero quiso dárselo a usted.

843
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,310
- What is it?
- It's a French dispatch.

844
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,750
They must have intercepted a messenger.
They do sometimes.

845
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,470
Oh, my God! It's Soult.

846
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,390
- Marshal Soult?
- Plans for a counteroffensive.

847
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,430
My lord must see this.

848
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,470
Get me my horse.

849
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,030
I think he said something about... the messenger.

850
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,420
Ellie, what is that?

851
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,470
It's made of some kind of skin.

852
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,830
(Thunder rumbles)

853
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,390
HAGMAN: By hell, I'm bloody drenched.

854
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,540
It's just as bloody wet in here.

855
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,380
BESS: Thank you, Sergeant.
- All in a day's work, ma'am.

856
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,070
SHARPE: Horses in here.

857
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:05,150
Get their loads off and all under cover.
What there is of it.

858
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,390
(Shivers)

859
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,870
(Stamping of hooves)

860
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,870
(Rasping cough)

861
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,510
Are you all right, ma'am?

862
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,550
I think so.

863
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,950
What is this place?

864
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,150
It's a house of God, ma'am.

865
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,190
But he hasn't been looking after it too well lately.

866
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,030
No.

867
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,070
(Sighs) Don't go.

868
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,070
Stay.

869
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,270
Casco

870
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,310
I don't want to think about him.

871
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,310
Just you now.

872
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,310
What about me?

873
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,030
Do you have a wife somewhere?

874
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,150
I had.

875
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,150
She...

876
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,190
She was shot dead.

877
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,670
Oh, I'm sorry.

878
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,710
I hate this land.

879
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,190
Come on. Up, you lazy buggers.

880
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,230
- (Moaning)
- Come on. Up!

881
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,110
Where's my lord?

882
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,140
- My lord.
- Munro, I thought you were far off.

883
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,110
I think you ought to see this.

884
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,910
Marshal Soult.

885
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,470
Was I right?

886
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:10,510
By God, you were.

887
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,270
- Halt the column.
OFFICER: Halt the column.

888
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,820
I misjudged him. He's quicker than I thought.

889
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,220
The man's a genius.

890
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:22,070
I think not. We can't have two geniuses
in the Peninsula.

891
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,790
- No, sir.
- Still. He'd have knocked me about.

892
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,590
And roundly. Too.

893
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,830
General staff assembly in ten minutes.

894
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,870
OFFICER: Very good. Sir.

895
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,790
Blood on this.

896
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,750
Aye, well.

897
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,910
The messenger would have succumbed.

898
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,590
Buenos días, señores.

899
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,510
We've got it all here as promised.

900
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:27,510
Have you brought the English soldiers?

901
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,630
- Harris, can you help?
- I'll try, sir.

902
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:37,070
Dónde están los soldados ingleses?

903
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,720
Aquí están.

904
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,750
He's says they're here, sir.

905
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,870
- Well, let's see them.
- Tráigalos.

906
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,270
Todo bien.

907
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,790
(Horses whinny)

908
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,340
SPANISH SOLDIER:
Venga, por aquí. Con prisa!

909
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,390
Rápido. Pa' lante!

910
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:09,180
- Dos por allí.
- Ten cuidado, rápido.

911
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,790
Cuidado. Rápido.

912
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,400
- Vale. Parados aquí.
- Quietos. No os mováis.

913
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,990
SHARPE: You men.

914
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:32,430
I'm Major Sharpe, South Essex Regiment.
I'm here to collect you.

915
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,270
You're going back.

916
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:36,470
Major Sharpe, sir.

917
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,470
You know me.

918
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,310
Ah, yes... I remember you.

919
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,350
Yes, sir.

920
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,390
My name's Rodd, sir.

921
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,190
Sergeant Rodd, as was.

922
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,830
Please, sir, don't let him...

923
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,220
I told you. I'm in charge.

924
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,510
Lieutenant Ayres, do your duty.
Get this rabble out of it.

925
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,270
Come on, move it out!

926
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,310
(Men mutter and groan)

927
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,710
AYRES: Come on.

928
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,750
Sergeant, the rifles.

929
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,950
SOLDIER: Adelante!

930
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:37,150
- The horses as well?
- Just get it done, Pat.

931
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,190
(Horses whinny)

932
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,470
I think we've finished, señor.

933
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,590
(El Casco imitates a bird cry)

934
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:59,550
(Cries)

935
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:01,870
Go on now, señor.

936
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,510
(Cries)

937
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,790
(Crying continues)

938
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,670
- (Clattering)
- Esto es parte de botírn.

939
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,710
Yo no lo quiero.

940
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,110
Says he doesn't need it.

941
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,830
That's ours, sir.

942
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:40,550
- They took everything off us.
- So it's your bit of loot, is it?

943
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,590
Get these off, sir.

944
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,830
- Better not.
- Sit down.

945
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,910
- We want water.
MEN: Yeah.

946
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,950
MAN: Water.
PROVOST: Sit down. Be quiet.

947
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,990
RODD: Here's some grub.

948
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,350
MAN: Over here!
MAN: Sergeant.

949
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,390
(All shout at once)

950
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,870
MAN: Please, water.
RODD: They starved us.

951
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,310
RODD: They grabbed us a few at a time.

952
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,030
We guessed they'd swap us.

953
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,870
- A wonder they didn't kill us.
- We're English.

954
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,990
So King George saved your skins, then?

955
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,430
What? Why did you say that?

956
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,790
It's just a manner of speaking.

957
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,310
MAN: Give us the water.
- Oh! Oh, yeah.

958
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,550
- Of course. Yeah.
- Was anybody killed?

959
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,790
Um... they caught the Froggy.

960
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,830
He was a messenger.

961
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,990
- What happened to him?
- I don't know.

962
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,030
They took him away.

963
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,150
They were supposed to be somewhere
up in the hills.

964
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,190
Caves, I heard.

965
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:48,150
- They're frightened to talk.
- Not surprising.

966
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,180
- Well, they're safe now.
- Safer.

967
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,630
Mrs. Nugent, we're leaving. You too, Ellie.

968
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:01,510
Oi! Can I have a scrap of baccy.

969
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,830
- Anything else, sir?
- No. That'll do me.

970
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:08,110
- Just a pipeful to keep me going.
- Let me see that.

971
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,670
Baccy?

972
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,630
Ma. Ma, it's Dada's.

973
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,670
It's the one I gave him.

974
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,950
- Where'd you get this?
- I found it.

975
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,870
- Where?
- I don't know. It was week s ago. On a road.

976
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,950
- Somebody must have host it.
- They did.

977
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,990
I never stole it.

978
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,270
- This is Dada's.
- Where was this road?

979
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,310
Out that way.

980
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,630
I just thought if I could get to the sea,
maybe buy a boat...

981
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,190
Get home.

982
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:39,230
Look, if you just give me some time,
I might remember.

983
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,110
- I could try And remember.
- He'll say anything.

984
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,150
- This is proof.
- An old pipe?

985
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,110
- I saw Dada make those marks.
- We're leaving now.

986
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,150
So pack up your gear, both of you.

987
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,150
Ellie...

988
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:12,190
- Take charge of it, Mr. Ayres. Make it official.
- On your feet, you scum!

989
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,390
HAGMAN: Forty I got for selling my shirt

990
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,710
And forty for selling my blanket

991
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,430
if ever I 'list for a soldier again

992
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,230
The devil shall be my sergeant

993
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:27,710
Poor old soldier

994
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,470
If ever I 'list for a soldier again

995
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,120
The devil shall be my sergeant

996
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:34,750
- Perkins.
- Sir?

997
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,750
Run and help the ladies. See to their horses.

998
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,790
Yes, sir.

999
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,870
Mrs. Nugent, Miss Nugent. It's time to leave.

1000
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,670
Where are you?

1001
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:51,870
Oh, no.

1002
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,390
Sir, I can't find them. I think they've gone.

1003
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:58,750
Damn.

1004
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,110
Gone without a word.

1005
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,150
They must be mad, off on their own.

1006
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,870
- What do we do now?
- We're finished up here.

1007
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:29,110
Those men go back to camp as planned.
Up to you, Lieutenant.

1008
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,150
Right, sir. And then you search?

1009
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,190
For Goods sake, yes

1010
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,310
Those bloody ignorant female fools.

1011
01:13:56,360 --> 01:14:00,230
- Are you not going with them, Mr. Ayres?
- My men are brutes. They'll manage.

1012
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,510
And recovering my lord's strayed relations
is an urgent duty.

1013
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,710
You find anything, Hagman?

1014
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:36,470
Nothing, sir. Ground's too hard for tracking.

1015
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,910
Nothing, sir. I've looked hard everywhere.

1016
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,950
Bugger.

1017
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,470
It's just the girl, isn't it?

1018
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,470
Mr. Ayres

1019
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,790
- Don't tell me we're hunting the old duenna.
- Have a care.

1020
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,510
How many times have you ploughed her?

1021
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,150
Look...

1022
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,510
I might decide I don't have a use for you.

1023
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,790
(Horse whinnies in distance)

1024
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,510
- Horses.
- (Distant chattering)

1025
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,590
Not just horses - men.

1026
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:34,430
- (Horse whinnies)
- I'd say French.

1027
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,750
- What is it?
- Shh.

1028
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,710
(Distant chattering)

1029
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,310
- (Chattering in French)
HARPER: Ht's the same hot.

1030
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,270
SHARPE: This time. We'll take them.

1031
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:04,230
(Whispers) Cooper, Harris, Perkins.

1032
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,110
Anglais!

1033
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,580
(French soldiers shout)

1034
01:16:58,560 --> 01:16:59,990
En garde, monsieur.

1035
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,430
SOLDIER: Allez, allez, allez!

1036
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,020
- Hundreds of bloody bushes, he pisses in mine.
- We should have bloody had him.

1037
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,070
Major.

1038
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,150
SHARPE: That's not one of them.

1039
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:03,700
That's a partisan.

1040
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,790
HARRIS: His obituary. I think.

1041
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:10,150
"A daily report
of Lieutenant Jean-Luc Barbier.

1042
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:11,750
Our prisoner

1043
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,470
has rendered himself to his wounds."

1044
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:18,270
- Not very good French.
- Is that all?

1045
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,310
No, there's more.

1046
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:24,070
It seems to be... about Aztecs.

1047
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:26,110
Let me see.

1048
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,110
"But he confessed much.

1049
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,830
I will not call them guerrillas. They are savages.

1050
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:42,550
They persist in a belief they are descended
from the ancient Aztec people of Mexico.

1051
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,870
This is to excuse their wanton savagery."

1052
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,750
Let's hear it.

1053
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:54,270
"They inhabit certain secret caves.
There they worship death."

1054
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,470
Mother of God.

1055
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,120
"Their leader is known as El Casco.

1056
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,350
Only the English. Who have no religion.

1057
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,710
Will have dealings with him...

1058
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:07,710
...to supply guns."

1059
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,470
What have we done, sir?

1060
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:12,350
AYRES: Listen.

1061
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:17,350
"I intend to discover this nest of savages
in the caves and destroy it utterly."

1062
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,950
Oh, yeah? Him and whose army?

1063
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,990
The fighting rabbit, eh?

1064
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,150
He's got the right idea.

1065
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,390
Jean-Luc Barbier.

1066
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,550
Forms his letters like a young kid.

1067
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,830
I nearly split him.

1068
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:18,150
- Do you think they're the ones who attacked us?
- Why don't you ask them?

1069
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,750
(Sighs) Oh, Ma.

1070
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,310
(Bird caws)

1071
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,950
It's his sort of place.

1072
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,990
What do you mean?

1073
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:35,030
If it was back home,
he would have stopped to paint or draw.

1074
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,390
Poor Will.

1075
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,710
Why poor? He's alive.

1076
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,390
I know he's alive.

1077
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:52,110
WELLINGTON: You men have committed crimes
under army haw.

1078
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,790
Enough to have you court-martialed And shot.

1079
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,510
As the Provost Marshal has correctly demanded.

1080
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:03,350
However, in a few week s
I enter the heartland of the enemy.

1081
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:08,030
I need every man who will follow me
and fight for me.

1082
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,550
Are you such men?

1083
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,230
ALL: Yes!

1084
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,870
Go back to your regiments.

1085
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:16,030
Wear your new red coats with pride.

1086
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:19,150
And I'll see you in the land
of Napoleon Bonaparte.

1087
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,190
ALL: Yeah!

1088
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,790
- Well?
- It's true, sir.

1089
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,470
And Sharpe's gone after them.

1090
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,510
Damned women. I knew it.

1091
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:35,190
What now? Mount a full search party?

1092
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,670
Leave it to Sharpe.

1093
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,750
Dismount, Mr. Ayres.

1094
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:59,540
- What's happening?
- I'm giving you an order, that's what. Get down.

1095
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:03,950
- It's my horse. I'm entitled...
- I will not have you ride when better men suffer.

1096
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,070
Are we going round in circles?

1097
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:18,430
- No.
- Oh, good. So, we're just lost, then?

1098
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:20,470
(Distant gunfire)

1099
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,510
Rifles.

1100
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,310
- Baker rifles.
- (Distant gunfire)

1101
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,990
A l'attaque!

1102
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,440
- (Distant gunfire)
- That was gunfire.

1103
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:57,470
A long way off.

1104
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,510
(Sighs)

1105
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,550
We shouldn't have done this.

1106
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:04,230
- Do you want to go back?
- Back? How?

1107
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,070
A couple of stubborn fools.
We shouldn't be here.

1108
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,110
Yes, we should.

1109
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:31,870
Ma! Look at this!

1110
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,390
It's Dada's.

1111
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:38,510
It's Dada's. He was here.
He was here in this very spot.

1112
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,350
Now we’ve got to go on.

1113
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,270
Of course.

1114
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:16,070
BESS: We'll stay on this riverbed.

1115
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:19,350
Will'd be keen on it -
for the picturesqueness, you know.

1116
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,870
- Ma.
- What is it?

1117
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,910
(Crackling and rustling)

1118
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,230
(Twigs snapping)

1119
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:34,630
Who is it? What do you want?

1120
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,950
- Are you loaded?
- Yeah.

1121
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:47,350
Get past them and go.

1122
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,030
Get out of my way!

1123
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:53,940
MA

1124
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:02,670
Ma... Ma... Ma.

1125
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,710
- Ma.
- Ellie.

1126
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,670
Oh, no. Ma?

1127
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,710
Ma, Ma, no (Sobs)

1128
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,870
(Wails) No!

1129
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:21,940
(Wails) Ma.

1130
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:23,990
(Man screams in terror)

1131
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,590
(Man screams) No. No. No.

1132
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:32,110
(Sobs)

1133
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,150
(Tortured screams) No. No.

1134
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:41,990
No.

1135
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,750
(Tortured screams)

1136
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,470
(Man screams in distance)

1137
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:56,190
- (Screaming continues)
- My God.

1138
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,030
How many is that?

1139
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,070
- Four?
- Five.

1140
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:05,350
But I've no wish to be counting.

1141
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,590
- I don't want to seem clever...
- Be as clever as you like.

1142
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:11,670
Whoever they are... I think it's a sacrifice.

1143
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,630
(Moans in terror)

1144
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:36,430
Dada.

1145
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:41,670
Oh, Dada. Dada, we've been looking for you
all over the place, me and Ma. We...

1146
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,710
(Moans and mutters)

1147
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:47,110
Huitzilopochtli... god of war.

1148
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,150
Tezcatlipoca...

1149
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:53,230
- Tezcathipoca... god of the smoking mirror...
- Dada.

1150
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:56,270
Tonatiuh... god of the sun.

1151
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:59,310
Xipe Totec...

1152
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,590
the Flayed God.

1153
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:03,910
Dada. Dada, who am I?

1154
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,070
You know me.

1155
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:09,910
Coathicue...

1156
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,790
...lady of the serpent skin.

1157
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,550
Oh... Dada.

1158
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,220
(Twig snaps)

1159
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,270
Please... I wish to make surrender.

1160
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:36,230
- I know that face.
- Yeah, so do I.

1161
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:40,670
You fought with me, monsieur... and ran.

1162
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,710
Oui. Je le regrette.

1163
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,360
Mais... I wish to be your prisoner.

1164
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,270
Please.

1165
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,740
- They have killed my men.
SHARPE: Who?

1166
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,030
- The partisans?
- Oui, les guérillas.

1167
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:56,830
Et puis... they cut the hearts out of them.

1168
01:28:58,360 --> 01:28:59,790
Les cœurs.

1169
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:01,950
Their hearts?

1170
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:07,630
They have also... une femme anglaise. Jeune...

1171
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:09,150
Ellie.

1172
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:12,150
What have they done to her?

1173
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:15,070
Take me to her. Now. Vite!

1174
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:17,110
Go on.

1175
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:24,190
(Nugent hums)

1176
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,870
Ma is dead.

1177
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,390
They killed her.

1178
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:35,430
(Humming continues)

1179
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,590
It was here that I saw.

1180
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:13,550
Monsieur, you will now redeem yourself.

1181
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,590
Pour la gloire.

1182
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:19,110
You will lead two companies of French infantry
to the attack.

1183
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,230
Two? Where are they?

1184
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:27,470
- You are not serious, monsieur?
- You will make a diversion.

1185
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,950
Une diversion. You will cry out orders,

1186
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:32,990
And so will my men.

1187
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:35,950
And fire your rifles. All of you.
To draw them away.

1188
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:43,510
Entendu.

1189
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:46,230
Mon brave.

1190
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,270
Harper.

1191
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:18,230
(Humming and chanting)

1192
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:24,790
Pour...

1193
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,830
spit...

1194
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:29,430
and ram.

1195
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,910
(Men chatter)

1196
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:55,790
I'm coming with you.

1197
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,950
Attrapez tous!

1198
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:05,910
BARBIER: Deuxième compagnie.
Faites avance.

1199
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,150
Troisième compagnie!

1200
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:21,310
(Gunfire continues)

1201
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:26,150
Charge á la baïonnette! Pas de prisonniers!

1202
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,340
(Woman screams)

1203
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,190
SHARPE: Ellie.
- She's fine.

1204
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:50,750
Ellie.

1205
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:52,230
It's me.

1206
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,990
Richard.

1207
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:02,350
What's happening?

1208
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:04,900
They've run. Every last one of them.

1209
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,350
Be sure.

1210
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:09,070
Harris, take Lieutenant Ayres out and bury him.

1211
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:11,110
Perkins, Hagman, go on guard.

1212
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:14,830
They've done well... including the Frenchman.

1213
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:21,550
Is that...

1214
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:25,270
- Ellie?
- It's Dada.

1215
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,230
Xipe Totec.

1216
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:38,230
Our Lord, the Flayed One.

1217
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,190
He can't even remember Ma.

1218
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,710
Ready, sir.

1219
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,750
Let's do it.

1220
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:07,670
The mind's a very funny thing, you know.

1221
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:12,230
I had an uncle once
who thought the fairies were after him.

1222
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,830
- What happened to him?
- They got him.

1223
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:16,550
All set?

1224
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:19,670
For you to do, sir.

1225
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,790
(Hisses and fizzles)

1226
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:05,710
Richard... it was here Ma was killed.

1227
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:08,710
Rifles... search!

1228
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,990
- Ellie?
- Dada.

1229
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:36,350
Oh, Dada! Dada?

1230
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:40,790
But he knew me then. He did.

1231
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:44,910
- He will again.
- He's on the mend. He'll be fine now.

1232
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,790
Tragic about your poor mother, my dear.

1233
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:59,670
I'm most grateful...

1234
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,630
to this young man.

1235
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:03,630
He saved us all.

1236
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:08,110
It's what he does. Isn't it, Sharpe?

1237
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:10,760
One last thing, sir.

1238
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:16,190
Loot recovered, sir.

1239
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:19,230
Mostly gold. Some silver.

1240
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:21,750
Is that all there was?

1241
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:26,950
Yes, sir. That's all.

1242
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:37,390
# When evil stalks upon the land

1243
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:41,750
# I'll neither hold nor stay me hand

1244
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:45,430
# But fight to win a better day

1245
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,470
# Over the hills and far away

1246
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:52,950
# O'er the hills and o'er the main

1247
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,390
# Through Flanders, Portugal and Spain

1248
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:02,470
# King George commands and we obey

1249
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:06,070
# Over the hills and far away
