171
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,740
Somewhere around 250, sir,
counting the officers.

172
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:59,245
How the heck are we supposed
to take care of 120 men?

173
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,206
Colonel, it's going to be a hot day today.

174
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:06,460
Seeing as you already been down
with the heat, will you ride the horse…

175
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:11,007
… that the good Lord provided,
instead of marching in the dirty dust?

176
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,675
You walked.

177
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:16,053
Darling, I've been in the infantry
since you was in books.

178
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,807
After the first few thousand miles,
a man gets limber with his feet.

179
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,059
Morning, Lawrence.

180
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,562
How are you?
You're looking kind of peaked.

181
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,814
Darn it, Tom. Don't call me Lawrence.

182
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,401
It doesn't make sense.

183
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:33,696
Hold a gun on a man to get him to fight.

184
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,539
BREWER:
Detail, about face.

185
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,543
Attention, detail!

186
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,588
GUARD: You heard the captain.
Stand at attention!

187
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,424
BREWER: Guards, get these men back
on their feet!

188
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,509
[PRISONERS GRUMBLING]

189
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,561
I'm looking
for commanding officer, 20th Maine.

190
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:06,812
You found him.

191
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,065
TOM: That's him.
- You're Chamberlain?

192
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,234
Colonel Chamberlain to you.

193
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,488
Captain Brewer, sir.

194
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,032
118th Pennsylvania.

195
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:22,078
If you're the commanding officer,
I present you with these prisoners.

196
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,579
You're welcome to them.

197
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:27,041
Lord knows, I had to use the bayonet
to keep them moving.

198
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,544
You have to sign for them.

199
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,507
Sign it, lieutenant.

200
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,852
You are relieved, captain.

201
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:51,107
You are authorized to use
whatever force necessary.

202
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,442
You want to shoot them…

203
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,486
… go right ahead.

204
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,030
Won't nobody say nothing.

205
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,538
I said you are relieved, captain.

206
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,345
You men can leave now.
We won't need any guards.

207
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:32,064
My name is Chamberlain.
I'm the colonel of the 20th Maine.

208
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,278
When did you have something to eat?

209
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,949
They're trying to break us
by not feeding us.

210
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,576
We ain't broke yet.

211
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,163
They just told me you were coming
a little while ago.

212
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,956
I'll get the cook going.

213
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,459
The meat may be raw,
but there's no time to cook.

214
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,379
We've got quite a ways to go today.
You'll be coming with us, so eat hearty.

215
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,382
We'll set you up in those trees.
Sergeant Tozier, see to it.

216
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,342
TOZIER:
Yes, sir.

217
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,179
Well.

218
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,392
You boys go eat, then I'll come over
and hear what you have to say.

219
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,730
Colonel.

220
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,358
Colonel, we've got grievances.

221
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,948
The men elected me to talk for them.

222
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,368
All right. You come along with me.

223
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:30,039
The rest of you boys go eat.
We're gonna get moving in a little bit.

224
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,840
TOZIER:
All right, men, on your feet.

225
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,593
- Gosh, Lawrence.
- Smile. Don't call me Lawrence.

226
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,012
- Are they moving?
- Yes, sir.

227
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,264
TOZIER:
Forward, march.

228
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,058
LAWRENCE:
What's your name?

229
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,187
I don't feel too kindly, colonel.

230
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,981
LAWRENCE: Yes, well,
I'm usually not this informal.

231
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,735
I just took command
of this regiment a few days ago.

232
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:03,822
Somebody ought to welcome you
to my, uh- To our outfit.

233
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:08,494
They tell me they're holding you fellows
because you signed three-year papers.

234
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,413
I'm sorry. Would you like some coffee?

235
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,541
Are you sure?

236
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,838
- Go ahead. Sit down, Mister…
- Bucklin.

237
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,548
Joseph Bucklin.

238
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,970
Listen, Colonel.
I've been in 11 different engagements.

239
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,055
How many have you been in?

240
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:31,767
Not that many.

241
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,311
It ain't the papers.

242
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,606
I done my share. We all have.

243
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:41,819
Damn good men.
Shouldn't be used this way.

244
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,531
Look here.

245
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,951
It went clean through.

246
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,954
Colonel, we got a courier coming.

247
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:58,460
Listen, colonel. I'm tired.

248
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,046
You know what I mean? I'm tired.

249
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:05,885
I've had all this army, all these officers…
This damn Hooker, this damn idiot Meade.

250
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:10,472
All of them. The whole bloody, lousy mess
of sick-brained, potbellied scareheads.

251
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,808
They ain't fit to lead a johnny detail.

252
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:17,605
They ain't fit to pour pee out of a boot
with instructions written under the heel.

253
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,815
I'm tired.

254
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,986
We are good men
and we had our own good flag.

255
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:28,157
These damn idiots used us
like we were cows or dogs or worse.

256
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,950
We ain't gonna win this war.

257
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,454
We can't win with these
lame-brained bastards from West Point.

258
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:36,832
These damn gentlemen. These officers!

259
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,752
KILRAIN:
The courier, sir.

260
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,257
Don't go away.

261
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,136
Colonel Chamberlain, sir.

262
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:52,514
Colonel Vincent wishes to inform you
the Fifth Corps is moving out.

263
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,351
You and the 20th Maine Regiment
are instructed to lead.

264
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,521
20th Maine's assigned first position in line.
Send out advanced guards and flankers.

265
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,024
LAWRENCE: Flankers?
- Yes, flankers.

266
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:05,319
LAWRENCE: Right, yes.
My compliments to the colonel.

267
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:08,113
Captain Clark, you heard him.
Get the regiment up.

268
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,324
Sound the assembly. Strike the tents.

269
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:15,537
You better get something to eat.
Looks like you could use it.

270
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,373
Tell your men I'm coming.

271
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,167
The boys from the Second Maine
are being fed, Lawrence.

272
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:21,960
Don't call me Lawrence.

273
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,672
Damn it, Lawrence. I'm your brother.

274
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,383
Be careful about the name business
in front of the men.

275
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,718
Because we're brothers,
it looks like favoritism.

276
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,346
General Meade got his own son
as his aide-de-camp.

277
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:35,307
That's different.
Generals can do anything.

278
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:39,395
Nothing quite so much like God on earth
as a general on battlefield.

279
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:43,816
What are you going to do with them?
Colonel, sir.

280
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,777
You can't shoot them.
You never go back to Maine if you do.

281
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,320
I know that.

282
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,490
I wonder if they do.

283
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,248
Colonel, sir. You know who this man is?

284
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,917
Dan Burns, from Orono.
I know his daddy, the preacher.

285
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,585
Best cusser I ever heard.

286
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,588
Knows more fine swear words
than any man in Maine.

287
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,110
LAWRENCE:
You men gather around.

288
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:45,127
I've been talking with Private Bucklin.
He's told me about your problem.

289
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,130
There's nothing I can do today.

290
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,133
We're moving out in a few minutes.
We'll be moving all day.

291
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,094
I've been ordered
to take you men with me.

292
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,055
I'm told that…

293
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,435
… if you don't come, I can shoot you.

294
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,396
Well, you know I won't do that.

295
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,399
Maybe somebody else will, but I won't.

296
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,401
So that's that.

297
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,654
Here's the, uh, situation.

298
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:16,658
The whole reb army is up that road
a ways waiting for us.

299
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,535
This is no time for an argument.

300
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,829
I tell you,
we could surely use you fellows.

301
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,998
We're now well below half strength.

302
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,919
Whether you fight or not,
that's up to you.

303
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:31,715
Whether you come along is…
Well, you're coming.

304
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,759
You know who we are,
what we're doing here.

305
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,970
If you fight alongside us,
there's a few things you must know.

306
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:42,017
This regiment was formed
last summer in Maine.

307
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,853
There were 1,000 of us then.

308
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,065
There are less than 300 of us now.

309
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:56,031
All of us volunteered to fight
for the Union, just as you did.

310
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:01,411
Some came mainly because
we were bored at home.

311
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:04,832
Thought this looked like it might be fun.

312
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,710
Some came because
we were ashamed not to.

313
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:15,843
Many of us came
because it was the right thing to do.

314
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,722
And all of us have seen men die.

315
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,185
This is a different kind of army.

316
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:28,522
If you look back through history,
you'll see men fighting for pay…

317
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:31,233
… for women, for some other kind of loot.

318
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,403
They fight for land, power.

319
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:40,033
Because a king leads them,
or just because they like killing.

320
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,578
We are here for something new.

321
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:47,040
This has not happened much
in the history of the world.

322
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,421
We are an army out to set other men free.

323
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,384
America should be free ground.

324
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,636
All of it.

325
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,973
Not divided by a line
between slave state and free.

326
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:08,020
All the way from here
to the Pacific Ocean.

327
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,357
No man has to bow.

328
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,485
No man born to royalty.

329
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:19,573
Here we judge you by what you do,
not by who your father was.

330
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,036
Here you can be something.

331
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:27,956
Here is the place to build a home.

332
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,044
But it's not the land.

333
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,380
There's always more land.

334
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:42,012
It's the idea that we all have value.

335
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,641
You and me.

336
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:55,150
What we're fighting for, in the end…

337
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,405
… we're fighting for each other.

338
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,212

going back to Gettysburg.

837
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:16,397
- They're all running.
- Very well. Thank you.

838
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:18,733
Find General Hill's chief of artillery.

839
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,944
Tell him I want fire placed on that hill.
As much fire as possible.

840
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,696
- Yes, sir.
- Very well.

841
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:30,703
- Major Taylor.
- Yes, sir.

842
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,497
Deliver this message in person.

843
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:36,000
Tell General Ewell the Federal troops
are withdrawing in confusion.

844
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:39,378
We must only push those people
in order to gain the heights.

845
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:43,299
Tell him to take that hill, if practical.
The one beyond the town.

846
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,218
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

847
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:46,886
LEE: Very well.
- Hyah!

848
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:58,981
Congratulations, general.

849
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,399
I want you to see this.

850
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,735
OFFICER: It's like second Manassas
all over again.

851
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:04,904
Couldn't have worked better
if we'd planned it.

852
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:08,741
If we can take that hill,
I want it occupied by nightfall.

853
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:11,953
Sir, the Federal army has fallen back
through Gettysburg.

854
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:14,580
They're reforming on the ridges
outside of town.

855
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:15,790
Very well.

856
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:19,877
This is almost perfect.
We got them where we want them.

857
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:22,797
Let's move south and east,
get between them and Lincoln…

858
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:24,382
… find some high ground…

859
01:12:24,549 --> 01:12:26,133
… and they'll have to hit us.

860
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,344
Then we have them, general.

861
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:30,388
You mean disengage?

862
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:32,515
I've always been under the impression…

863
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:36,602
… that it was our strategy to conduct
a defensive campaign wherever possible…

864
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,354
… in order to keep the army intact.

865
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:41,315
Granted, but the situation has changed.

866
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:43,734
- How?
LEE: We already pushed them back.

867
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:45,778
They're on the run, vacating the town.

868
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:48,990
How can we move off
in the face of the enemy?

869
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:50,867
- Major Marshall?
MARSHALL: Yes, sir.

870
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:53,786
I ordered firing on that hill,
but no cannons are firing.

871
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:56,289
- Send over and find out why.
- I'll see to it, sir.

872
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:57,999
Thank you.

873
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:04,255
What are you thinking, general?

874
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:07,967
Maybe we should not have fought here.

875
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:11,804
I know that. But we have prevailed.
The men have prevailed.

876
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:13,514
LONGSTREET:
They've always done that.

877
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:16,309
But in the morning,
we may be outnumbered…

878
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:19,854
… and they'll be entrenched
on the high ground.

879
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:23,482
You know as well as I, we've never been
concerned with being outnumbered.

880
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:25,484
LONGSTREET:
That is true. You are right.

881
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:28,446
If we move south to Washington,
they have to pursue us.

882
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:30,865
Then we can fight on ground
of our choosing.

883
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:32,783
But the enemy is here.

884
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:35,494
We did not want the fight,
but the fight is here.

885
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:40,082
How can I ask this army to retreat
in the face of what they've done this day?

886
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,710
Not retreat, sir. Re-deploy.

887
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:46,797
Our guns will move them off that hill
or Ewell will push them off.

888
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:49,759
But if Meade is there tomorrow,
I can't move this army away.

889
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,010
I will attack him.

890
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:54,805
If Meade is up there tomorrow,
it is because he wants us to attack him.

891
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:58,434
We pushed back two corps,
but there are five more coming.

892
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,900
General, I will bring up my boys
as soon as I can.

893
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:07,568
Very well.

894
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:09,362
- General?
- Sir?

895
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:12,073
Your man Harrison, the actor,
he was quite correct.

896
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:16,535
Had it not been for him, this entire army
might have been destroyed in detail.

897
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:20,122
The Federal force might've been here
waiting when we turned around.

898
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,750
I'm deeply grateful to you, sir.

899
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:57,576
TOM:
Hello, men.

900
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:00,788
What outfit are you with?

901
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:03,124
Archer's brigade, Heth's division.

902
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:05,668
TOM: Where you from?
PRISONER: Tennessee.

903
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:06,919
How about you?

904
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,921
Maine.

905
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:10,798
I've never been to Tennessee.

906
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:12,883
I reckon I've never been to Maine neither.

907
01:15:15,136 --> 01:15:17,680
I don't mean no disrespect
to you fighting men…

908
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:23,602
… but sometimes I can't help but figure,
why are you fighting this war?

909
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,187
Why are you fighting it?

910
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:29,150
To free the slaves, of course.
And to preserve the Union.

911
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:33,779
I don't know about other folk,
but I ain't fighting for no darkies.

912
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,489
I'm fighting for my rights.

913
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:37,533
That's what we're all fighting for.

914
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,869
- For your what?
- For our rights.

915
01:15:41,996 --> 01:15:44,957
Why can't you folks live
the way you want to live…

916
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:46,917
… and let us live the way we do?

917
01:15:48,002 --> 01:15:50,921
"Live and let live," I hear some folks say.

918
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:56,385
Be a mite less fuss and bother
if more folks took it to heart.

919
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,181
Where'd you get captured?

920
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:02,600
PRISONER: Railroad cut
west of Gettysburg town.

921
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:04,852
It wasn't a pretty sight.

922
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:09,315
Many a good boy lost
a young and promising life.

923
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:12,568
Some wore blue, some wore gray.

924
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:18,449
Seen enough of this war?

925
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,826
I guess I have.

926
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:23,496
I guess I have too.

927
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,957
It looks like
I'll be sitting out the rest of it.

928
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:32,421
I appreciate you talking to me.

929
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:35,007
See you in hell, Billy Yank.

930
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:39,011
See you in hell, Johnny Reb.

931
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:49,688
KILRAIN:
I have found a John Henry, sir.

932
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,023
LAWRENCE:
John who?

933
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:55,528
KILRAIN: A John Henry, sir. A runaway.
I heard him a-groaning.

934
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:09,542
Is he wounded?

935
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,794
Don't know for sure.

936
01:17:17,758 --> 01:17:19,176
The man's exhausted.

937
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:22,888
We'll get him something to eat.
The surgeon's on the way.

938
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:27,309
- Did you get his name?
- He said something I couldn't understand.

939
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:29,979
I can't understand anyone
south of Mason-Dixon.

940
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:31,856
Rebs or darkies.

941
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:45,953
All right, men, as you were.
Surgeon, see to him.

942
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:59,008
LAWRENCE: We had visitors
from the South before the war.

943
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:03,262
They were always very polite, academic,
you understand.

944
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:07,016
We stayed off the question of slavery
out of courtesy.

945
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:10,394
But toward the end there was
no getting away from it…

946
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:14,940
… and yet I could never understand.
I don't now.

947
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:17,484
I don't know why.

948
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:21,614
They fight so well.

949
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:30,956
Tell me something, Buster…

950
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:34,793
… what do you think of Negroes?

951
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:39,673
Well, if you mean the race…

952
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:42,217
… I don't really know.

953
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,262
This is not a thing to be ashamed of.

954
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:50,142
The thing is, you cannot judge a race.

955
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:54,146
Any man who judges by the group
is a pea-wit.

956
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:57,232
You take men one at a time.

957
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,735
To me, there was never any difference.

958
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:02,529
- None at all?
- None at all.

959
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,907
Of course, I haven't known
that many freed men…

960
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:08,494
… but those I knew in Bangor, Portland…

961
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:12,539
… you look in the eye, there was a man.

962
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:16,168
There was a "divine spark,"
as my mother used to call it.

963
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:17,878
That's all there is to it.

964
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:20,339
Races are men.

965
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:24,343
"What a piece of work is man.

966
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:28,055
How infinite in faculties,

967
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:30,766
… how express and admirable.

968
01:19:32,559 --> 01:19:34,937
In action, how like an angel."

969
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:40,859
Well, if he's an angel, all right then…

970
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:44,905
… but he damn well must be a killer angel.

971
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:53,831
Colonel, darling, you're a lovely man.

972
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:59,211
I see a vast great difference between us,
yet I admire you, lad.

01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,048
You're an idealist, praise be.

974
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:06,552
The truth is, colonel…

975
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:10,723
… there is no "divine spark."

976
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:16,311
There's many a man alive no more of value
than a dead dog. Believe me.

977
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:21,066
When you've seen them hang each other
the way I have back in the Old Country.

978

Equality?

979
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:28,365
What I'm fighting for is the right to prove
I'm a better man than many of them.

980
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:34,246
Where have you seen this "divine spark"
in operation, colonel?

981
01:20:34,413 --> 01:20:37,958
Where have you noted
this magnificent equality?

982
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:42,212
No two things on earth are equal
or have an equal chance.

983
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:44,798
Not a leaf, not a tree.

984
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:50,054
There's many a man worse than me
and some better…

985
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:54,058
… but I don't think race or country
matters a damn.

986
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:58,020
What matters, colonel…

987
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:01,565
… is justice.

988
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:10,115
Which is why I'm here.

989
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:13,827

01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:34,491
Good Lord, what is that smell?

1006
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:37,244
That's me. Ain't it lovely?

1007
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:39,454
He got it off a dead Frenchman.

1008
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:41,373
- Good evening.
LONGSTREET: Hey, Lo.

1009
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:44,042
PICKETT: I did not get it off
a dead Frenchman.

1010
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,628
I bought it in a store
in Richmond with Sally.

1011
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:49,465
It did have a French name,
but Miss Corbert likes it.

1012
01:22:49,631 --> 01:22:50,966
[LAUGHING]

1013
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:53,218
- How are you, general?
- Good, Jim, good. How are you?

1014
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:54,678
Real good.

1015
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:56,305
Dick, how's it going?

1016
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:58,056
Fine, John, just fine.

1017
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:01,435
Good. Oh, listen, I am sorry to assign you
to old smelly George here…

1018
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:04,771
… but I hear tell you have
a strong stomach.

1019
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:07,357
General, I want you to know…

1020
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:11,528
… how much I appreciate this opportunity
to be back in action again, sir.

1021
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:14,406
Let it go, Dick. Let it go.

1022
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,284
I consider it a damn fine piece of luck…

1023
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:20,120
… to have a man of your caliber
attached to this command. I do.

1024
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:24,082
Uh, general, sir.
Just exactly what do we have here?

1025
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:25,667
LONGSTREET:
Oh. Excuse me.

1026
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:28,795
Gentlemen? Colonel Fremantle?

1027
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:32,382
Allow me to introduce
Major General George Pickett.

1028
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:35,010
General Pickett,
Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Fremantle…

1029
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:38,931
… of Her Majesty's venerable
and elite Cold Stream Guards…

1030
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:41,391
… Britain's military attache
to the Confederacy…

1031
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:44,978
… and, you might say,
the eyes and ears of Queen Victoria.

1032
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:48,941
Hardly, sir. I'm merely an observer
and your humble guest.

1033
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:51,860
Sir…

1034
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:54,363
… the fame of your regiment
has preceded you.

1035
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:58,825
LONGSTREET: General Pickett here
is our ranking strategist.

1036
01:23:58,992 --> 01:24:03,956
The First Corps Army of Northern Virginia.
We refer all our deeper questions to him.

1037
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:05,874
They do. They do indeed.

1038
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:09,461
His record at West Point
is still the talk of both armies.

1039
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:13,799
You know I consider it unbecoming
to a soldier, all this book learning.

1040
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:17,010
- Book learning ain't for gentlemen, right?
- Nor that either.

1041
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:20,806
He graduated last in his class. Dead last.

1042
01:24:20,973 --> 01:24:23,016
Quite a feat, considering his classmates.

1043
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:25,018
[LAUGHING]

1044
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:30,107
The Yankees got all the smart ones.
Look where it's got them.

1045
01:24:31,191 --> 01:24:33,360
Colonel, allow me
to present my commanders.

1046
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:37,364
Each one of these chaps, as you might say,
commands a brigade of mine.

1047
01:24:37,531 --> 01:24:39,992
Now this fellow here, this is Lo Armistead.

1048
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:42,786
Lo! That's short for Lothario.

1049
01:24:42,953 --> 01:24:44,454
The lover.

1050
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:47,749
This here is Richard Brooke Garnett.
You'll pardon his limp.

1051
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:50,168
He got kicked by his horse the other day.

1052
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:52,045
That fellow there…

1053
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:53,839
That's Jim Kemper.

1054
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:56,508
You note the shifty eye,
the hand in the pocket.

1055
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:59,136
He's not even a West Pointer,
so watch him.

1056
01:24:59,303 --> 01:25:02,514
He's a politician from Virginia.
Jimmy's only here for the votes.

1057
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,808
KEMPER: I was Speaker of the House
in Virginia.

1058
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:09,062
As a matter of fact, I'd like to talk to you
about some political matters.

1059
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:10,897
You know the queen, don't you?

1060
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:14,693
What I need to know
and tell my folks back home is:

1061
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,820
When are you going to do something…

1062
01:25:16,987 --> 01:25:19,615
… about that damn Yankee blockade
out there on the water?

1063
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:21,241
Can you tell me something about that?

1064
01:25:21,408 --> 01:25:24,036
Time for some branch water. Come on.

1065
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:31,001
General? Sir.

1066
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,671
Might I have a few words?

1067
01:25:35,422 --> 01:25:38,342
Sure, George. Come on.

1068
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:46,767
I must confess I'm rather curious
about General Longstreet.

1069
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:51,438
Up until tonight, he never seemed to
fraternize all that much.

1070
01:25:51,605 --> 01:25:54,649
Almost dour, one would have
to suggest.

1071
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:58,987
Well, if I were you, colonel,
I'd count myself among the lucky.

1072
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:04,034
He just happens to be about the best
damn poker player in this here man's army.

1073
01:26:04,201 --> 01:26:07,454
There was a time you'd have
to fight to keep him out of a game.

1074
01:26:07,621 --> 01:26:12,292
Scarlet fever hit Richmond last winter,
right at Christmastime.

1075
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:15,796
General lost all three of his children
to it.

1076
01:26:15,962 --> 01:26:18,256
The youngest was 10.

1077
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:21,635
Hasn't been quite the same since.

1078
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:28,850
- Um… The queen.
- To the queen.

1079
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:31,311
Her majesty.

1080
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:37,234
Well, see, you are looking fine.

1081
01:26:38,777 --> 01:26:41,071
Looking lovely yourself, George.

1082
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:45,158
General. No reflection on you, sir…

1083
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:47,744
… but you know, my division,
my Virginia boys…

1084
01:26:47,911 --> 01:26:50,705
… we haven't seen all that much action
for a long time.

1085
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:53,625
I mean, well, we weren't that engaged
at Fredericksburg.

1086
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:57,295
We missed Chancellorsville altogether.
Off on some piddling affair.

1087
01:26:57,462 --> 01:27:00,173
Now they took two of my brigades,
Corson, Jenkins, and sent them…

1088
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,759
… off to guard Richmond.
I mean, Richmond of all places?

1089
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:05,971
And now, sir, do you know where
I've been placed in the line of march?

1090
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:09,933
Last, sir. That's where I am, exactly last.
I'm bringing up the damn rear.

1091
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,769
Beg pardon, sir.
You see, my boys…

1092
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:16,148
… are beginning to feel a trifle disgusted
at this attitude towards them…

1093
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:17,649
… as fighting men, sir. My boys-

1094
01:27:17,816 --> 01:27:18,859
- George.
- Sir.

1095
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:21,778
- Please.
- I sure don't mean to imply you, sir.

1096
01:27:21,945 --> 01:27:23,447
No. Hell no, sir.

1097
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:26,950
No, it's just, uh…
Well, the bureaucrats.

1098
01:27:27,117 --> 01:27:30,495
See, I was just- I was hoping, sir,
that perhaps you could…

1099
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:34,082
… talk to somebody about this
arrangement of the troops.

1100
01:27:34,624 --> 01:27:38,253
Would you like me to move the whole army
to the side so you can go first?

1101
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,005
Sir?

1102
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:44,968
Now that you mention it…

1103
01:27:45,135 --> 01:27:48,346
There is no plot, George.
It's just the way things fell out.

1104
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:51,141
I mean, hell, look at it this way.

1105
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:54,352
If the army has to turn around,
fight its way back…

1106
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:56,938
… well, you'll be first in line.

1107
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:02,986
Yes, I suppose that is true, isn't it?

1108
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:05,155
You understand, sir.

1109
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:07,866
That this whole damn war
might be over after one more battle…

1110
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:10,118
… and my Virginia boys
will have missed most of it.

1111
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:11,870
Yeah, I know.

1112
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:14,998
How far back are they?

1113
01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:17,209
Chambersburg, a hard day's march, sir.

1114
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:18,960
Mm-hm.

1115
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:22,756
I know I can count on you, George,
when the time comes…

1116
01:28:22,923 --> 01:28:25,300
… and it will come. It will come.

1117
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:28,720
Sorry to butt in, but they're calling
for George over at the poker table.

1118
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:31,306
Your fame, sir, has preceded you.

1119
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:34,684
Well, thank you, general.

1120
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:40,148
Well, cheerio, fellas.

1121
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:44,194
Don't forget to bring your money.

1122
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:49,658
Have you heard any news of old Winfield?

1123
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:52,202
Old Winnie boy?

1124
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:55,288
Hancock? Oh, yeah.

1125
01:28:56,081 --> 01:28:58,250
Well, how's he doing?

1126
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:01,086
- You're gonna find out.
- Yeah?

1127
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:06,842
He's got the Second Corps.
Damn clover leaves.

1128
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:10,804
He's headed this way. Probably run
into him in the next few days.

1129
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:17,435
ARMISTEAD:
I wish I could see him again.

1130
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:21,106
I haven't seen him since before the war.

1131
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,318
Never thought it would last this long.

1132
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:27,904
Me neither, Lo.

1133
01:29:28,446 --> 01:29:31,950
I sure would like to talk
to old Hancock again.

1134
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:34,077
One more time.

1135
01:29:38,123 --> 01:29:39,374
Well, why not?

1136
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:42,544
You wouldn't mind?

1137
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:44,546
Hell, no.

1138
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:47,591
I mean, really.

1139
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:52,137
Do you think it would be proper?
You know, ethical?

1140
01:29:52,304 --> 01:29:55,682
Look, when the time comes,
and he's close…

1141
01:29:55,849 --> 01:29:59,728
… just send a messenger over
under a flag of truce and go on over.

1142
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:01,896
Ain't nothing to it.

1143
01:30:02,898 --> 01:30:06,026
Last time I saw him was in California.

1144
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:08,653
Right when the war was beginning…

1145
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:13,408
… the night before we all left
to go fight against each other.

1146
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:16,119
Old friends off to war.

1147
01:30:16,286 --> 01:30:19,247
- Hey, Lo.
- Hm?

1148
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:23,543
- How's your brigade?
- Oh.

1149
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:27,964
I've never seen troops anywhere
so ready for a brawl.

1150
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:32,010
I've got to give the old man credit.
A lot of credit for that.

1151
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:36,264
Who else could've held
this army together for so long?

1152
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:39,976
Remember what they used to say
about him?

1153
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:45,523
When he first took command?
They called him "Old Granny."

1154
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:50,028
Lord, what damn fools we were.

1155
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:53,657
Now when he passes…

1156
01:30:53,823 --> 01:30:58,495
… the boys hush as if they had seen
an angel of the Lord.

1157
01:31:00,205 --> 01:31:02,540
Have you ever seen anything like that?

1158
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:06,836
No. I can't say I have.

1159
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:10,215
It's amazing what one honest man can do.

1160
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:14,386
Mm. One honest man and a cause.

1161
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:19,349
I don't think on that too much anymore.

1162
01:31:20,809 --> 01:31:23,311
I guess my only cause is victory.

1163
01:31:23,478 --> 01:31:26,231
This war comes as a nightmare.
You pick your nightmare side.

1164
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:28,525
Then you put your head down and win.

1166

Old gloomy Pete!

1167
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:34,364
You see, colonel…

1168
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:38,326
… the government derives its power
from the consent of the people.

1169
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:40,578
Every government, everywhere.

1170
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:44,499
Let me make this very plain to you, sir.

1171
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:48,545
We do not consent
and we will never consent.

1172
01:31:48,712 --> 01:31:51,881
And what you've got to do is,
you've got to go back over there…

1173
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:55,093
… to your Parliament and you've got
to make it very plain to them.

1174
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:58,096
You've got to tell them
that what we're fighting for here…

1175
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:02,392
… is the freedom from what we consider
to be the rule of a foreign power.

1176
01:32:02,559 --> 01:32:05,437
I mean, that's all we want.
That's what this war is all about.

1177

- Jim.
- No, no, no.

1178
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:10,150
Now, we established this country
in the first place…

1179
01:32:10,316 --> 01:32:12,485
… with very strong state governments…

1180
01:32:12,652 --> 01:32:14,904
… just for that very reason.

1181
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:17,449
I mean, let me put it to you this way.

1182
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:20,285
My home is in Virginia.

1183
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:23,872
The government of my home is home.

1184
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:26,499
Virginia would not allow itself
to be ruled…

1185
01:32:26,666 --> 01:32:29,502
… by some king over there in London.

1186
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:33,465
It's not about to let itself be ruled
by some president in Washington.

1187
01:32:33,631 --> 01:32:37,135
Virginia, by God, sir,
is going to be run by Virginians.

1188
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:39,345
Oh, my. The cause.

Actually, I got a pair of kings.

1190
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:43,266
And it's all for the Yankees.

1191
01:32:43,433 --> 01:32:45,393
The damn money-grubbing Yankees.

1192
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:48,062
I mean, those damn fools,
they don't get the message.

1193

Always the darkies.
Nothing but the darkies.

1194

PICKETT:
You know, Jim…

1195
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:54,486
Sit down. I think that my idea…

1196
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:59,657
… my analogy of a gentlemen's club
is fair enough. It's clear enough.

1197
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:01,493
Colonel, think on it now.

1198
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:04,746
Suppose that we all joined a club,
a gentlemen's club.

1199
01:33:04,954 --> 01:33:08,666
After a time, several of the members
began to intrude themselves…

1200
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:11,336
… into our private lives, our home lives.

1201
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:14,172
Began telling us
what we could and couldn't do.

1202
01:33:14,339 --> 01:33:17,383
Well, then, wouldn't any one of us
have the right to resign?

1203
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:20,178
I mean, just resign.

1204
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:21,513
That's what we did.

1205
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:26,726
That's what I did and now these people
are telling us we don't have that right.

I got to hand it to you.

1208
01:33:32,524 --> 01:33:35,944
You certainly do have a talent
for trivializing the momentous…

1209
01:33:36,111 --> 01:33:38,196
… and complicating the obvious.

1210
01:33:38,363 --> 01:33:40,573
Have you ever considered
running for Congress?

1211
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:43,409
No. It's a thought.

1212
01:33:47,205 --> 01:33:49,582
What does Colonel Fremantle think?

1213
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:52,126
Will the British come in on our side?

1214
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:57,715
Hell, yeah. They'll come in
when we don't need them no more.

1215
01:33:57,882 --> 01:34:01,678
Like some damn bank lending you money
when you're no longer in debt.

we're going to have a hell of a fight here.

I want you to do everything necessary
to get your boys ready.

Good evening, John.

How are you, John?

I'm all right.

But the brigades are pretty shot up.
I need to get refitted.

HANCOCK: Right. I'll see to it.
We know what you did this morning.

01:35:48,284 --> 01:35:50,495
That was
one hell of a piece of soldiering.

Thank you, sir.

1237
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:56,125
Heard you were with John Reynolds
when he was killed.

1238
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:58,836
I'm sending the body up
to his folks in Lancaster.

1239
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:01,047
They might appreciate a note from you.

1240
01:36:01,214 --> 01:36:02,632

we should've taken it.

There was no one there at all
and it commanded the town.

1293
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:17,929
I said to General Ewell these words…

1294
01:40:18,095 --> 01:40:20,056
I said to him:

1295
01:40:20,223 --> 01:40:25,019
"Sir, give me one division
and I will take that hill."

1296
01:40:26,103 --> 01:40:30,525
He said nothing.
He just stood there and stared at me.

1297
01:40:30,691 --> 01:40:34,612
I said, "General Ewell,
give me one brigade…

1298
01:40:34,779 --> 01:40:37,365
… and I will take that hill."

1299
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:40,451
I was becoming disturbed, sir.

1300
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:45,790
And General Ewell put his arms
behind him and blinked.

1301
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:50,753
So I said,
"General, give me one regiment…

1302
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:53,673
… and I will take that hill."

1303
01:40:54,257 --> 01:40:56,634
And he said nothing.

01:40:56,801 --> 01:40:58,970
He just stood there.

1305
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:02,765
I threw down my sword.
Down on the ground in front of him.

1306
01:41:12,149 --> 01:41:14,443
We could have done it, sir.

1307
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:17,154
A blind man should have seen it.

… many a good boy will die…

01:41:37,341 --> 01:41:40,177

… good ground.

1323
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:10,017
Is this good ground, general?

1324
01:43:10,768 --> 01:43:12,978
Is this the place to have an army?

1325
01:43:13,145 --> 01:43:16,982
Very good ground, sir. Very good ground.

01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:19,443
I hope you are right.

1327
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:23,823
Because we are going to have a fight here
sure enough in the morning.

1328
01:43:27,785 --> 01:43:32,123
General Ewell, I had hoped that
after moving through the town…

1329
01:43:32,289 --> 01:43:34,542
… you would've taken that hill.

1330
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:36,752
I didn't think it was practical.

1331
01:43:37,294 --> 01:43:39,630
Well, for many reasons.

1332
01:43:39,797 --> 01:43:42,341
We marched all day, and we'd fought.

1333
01:43:42,508 --> 01:43:46,137
And your orders were to caution
against bringing on a general engagement.

1334
01:43:46,303 --> 01:43:50,307
There were reports of Federal troops
in the north, sir.

1335
01:43:50,474 --> 01:43:53,310
We couldn't bring sufficient artillery
to bear on that hill.

1336
01:43:54,145 --> 01:43:59,150
We decided it was best to wait
for another of our divisions, Johnson's.

1337
01:43:59,316 --> 01:44:03,988
Yes, sir. Johnson didn't arrive
till after dark, just a while ago.

1338
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:07,742
He's out there now,
looking over the terrain.

1339

General Early, do you think you can
attack on your flank in the morning?

[SIGHS]

1341
01:44:14,039 --> 01:44:16,959
That hill will be a very strong position
once it's fortified…

… which is what they're doing
right now, sir.

I am very much aware of that, general.

Have you looked over
the ground yourself, sir?

1345
01:44:24,842 --> 01:44:26,260
From a distance only.

1346
01:44:28,012 --> 01:44:30,598
I do not think we should attack
this point.

1347
01:44:30,765 --> 01:44:33,100
This will be the strong point.

1348
01:44:34,018 --> 01:44:37,897
Our troops have marched hard
and fought hard today.

1349
01:44:38,063 --> 01:44:43,444
I suggest we hold here while the rest
of the army attacks the other flank.

1350
01:44:43,611 --> 01:44:46,363
Do you think an attack on your flank
will succeed?

1351
01:44:47,698 --> 01:44:49,867
I think it would be very costly.

1352
01:44:50,034 --> 01:44:51,368
Very costly, sir.

1354
01:44:57,041 --> 01:45:00,503
We, uh, could attack of course, general…

1355
01:45:00,669 --> 01:45:05,049
… but the boys have had a good fight
and that will be a strong position.

1356
01:45:08,052 --> 01:45:11,263
General, I am sorry we didn't
take that hill today.

Well, this day is done.

You know, General Longstreet proposes
that we move our army around to the right…

1359

… and flank the Federal army…

1360
01:45:24,401 --> 01:45:27,404

Meade and Washington.

1361

And to vacate this position?

To leave this town
we've just captured, sir?

1363

This town is of no military significance
whatsoever, general.

1364
01:45:35,913 --> 01:45:39,625
To move this entire corps in the face
of a fortified enemy?

And yet you tell me
that you cannot attack in the morning?

Gentlemen, if we do not withdraw and if we
do not maneuver in the face of the enemy…

1367
01:45:49,552 --> 01:45:53,389

Is there any other alternative?

The position of the Federal army
is in the shape of a fishhook.

1417

this low ridge to the south…

withdrawing from Gettysburg…

… or almost a member of this enterprise.

It's so very sad. Very sad.

1518
01:55:42,435 --> 01:55:45,856
You English had your own civil war once,
didn't you?

1519
01:55:46,022 --> 01:55:48,900
That was ages ago.

Your candor is admirable,
if somewhat eccentric.

1536
01:56:54,257 --> 01:56:56,593
A little eccentricity is good for a general.

1537
01:56:57,302 --> 01:57:01,556
We Southerners like our men religious
and a little bit mad.

1538
01:57:02,432 --> 01:57:06,311
I suspect that's why the women
fall in love with preachers.

If I may be so bold…

1540
01:57:13,109 --> 01:57:16,112
… what's to prevent the Yankees
from attacking us here?

1541
01:57:16,279 --> 01:57:20,951
I notice you haven't bothered
to entrench or build a fortified perimeter.

1542
01:57:21,117 --> 01:57:23,954
Ohh. We were alert today.

1543
01:57:25,497 --> 01:57:30,961
But old George Meade ain't gonna
do us any favors.

1544
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:35,590
What we must do is we must
make him attack us.

1545
01:57:36,424 --> 01:57:39,135
And in order to do that, we have to
occupy dangerous ground…

1546

1547
01:57:40,971 --> 01:57:46,142
Then- Then the politicians will press him
to attack us.

1548
01:57:46,935 --> 01:57:49,980
Which he will most certainly do,
given time.

1549

Oh, I see. Very clever. Very clever.

1550
01:57:55,110 --> 01:57:57,070
So Lee doesn't dig in…

1551
01:57:57,237 --> 01:58:00,031
… knowing with certainty
that Meade will not attack him here.

1552
01:58:00,198 --> 01:58:03,368
Meade will expect him to swing around
to the south…

1553
01:58:03,535 --> 01:58:07,831
… in an attempt to cut him off from
the capital, his supplies and reserves.

1554
01:58:07,998 --> 01:58:12,460
So while Meade ponders his own position,
for fear he'll be flanked…

1555
01:58:12,627 --> 01:58:15,672
… Lee will actually attack him here,
where he least suspects it.

false feeling of security…

Yes, but there it was very dry.

- There was some good men in that army.
- Yes, indeed.

Some of those men are waiting for us now

- I guess so.
- Let us not think about that now.

02:54:30,585 --> 02:54:32,545
Thank you, Peter.

2172
02:54:36,549 --> 02:54:38,385
I had to talk about that.

2173
02:54:45,934 --> 02:54:49,646
I'm sending Almira Hancock…

2174
02:54:50,355 --> 02:54:53,900
… a small package to be opened…

02:54:54,067 --> 02:54:56,861
… in the event of my death.

02:55:01,366 --> 02:55:03,159
You'll drop by and see her…

02:55:03,702 --> 02:55:05,620
… after this is over.

02:55:05,787 --> 02:55:07,580
Won't you, Pete?

02:55:16,464 --> 02:55:18,091
Thank you.

What day is it now, major?

2181
02:55:26,266 --> 02:55:28,226
It's long after midnight, sir.

02:55:28,393 --> 02:55:29,811
It's already Friday.

- Yes, sir.

- Then tomorrow is the Fourth of July.

Huh.

02:55:41,740 --> 02:55:45,201
- I'd quite forgotten.
- The good Lord has a sense of humor.

I'm very sorry to keep you up so late.

2189
02:55:48,204 --> 02:55:49,539
It is my pleasure.

2190
02:55:49,706 --> 02:55:51,791
We should have a larger staff.

2191
02:55:51,958 --> 02:55:54,627
I'd be offended, sir.

Very well.

General Stuart is waiting to see you, sir.

- Shall I bring him in?
- Of course.

- Major?
- Yes, sir.

General Stuart and I
must not be disturbed.

It is the opinion of some excellent officers
that you have let us all down.

Sir, if you will please tell me
who these gentlemen are?

There is no time.

General Stuart.

2208
02:57:03,488 --> 02:57:07,367
Your mission was to free this army…

2209
02:57:07,534 --> 02:57:09,202
… from the enemy cavalry.

2210
02:57:09,369 --> 02:57:12,789
And to report any movement
by the enemy's main body.

2211
02:57:13,039 --> 02:57:15,041
That mission was not fulfilled.

2212
02:57:15,208 --> 02:57:16,918
You left here…

2213
02:57:17,085 --> 02:57:21,172
… with no word of your movement
or movement of the enemy for days.

2214
02:57:21,339 --> 02:57:23,883
Meanwhile we were engaged
and drawn into battle…

2215
02:57:24,050 --> 02:57:27,554
… without adequate knowledge
of the enemy's strength or position.

2216
02:57:27,720 --> 02:57:29,305
Without knowledge of the ground.

2217
02:57:29,472 --> 02:57:33,726
So it is only by God's grace
that we did not meet disaster here.

2218
02:57:33,893 --> 02:57:35,562
General Lee, there were reasons.

2219
02:57:35,728 --> 02:57:39,065
LEE: Perhaps you
misunderstood my orders.

2220
02:57:39,774 --> 02:57:42,277
Perhaps I did not make myself clear.

2221
02:57:42,944 --> 02:57:46,865
Well, sir, this must be made very clear.

2222

You, sir…

02:57:49,409 --> 02:57:52,954
… with your cavalry,
are the eyes of this army.

2224
02:57:53,121 --> 02:57:56,040
Without your cavalry, we are made blind.

2225
02:57:56,207 --> 02:57:58,293
That has already happened once.

2226
02:57:58,459 --> 02:58:02,422
It must never, never happen again.

2227
02:58:10,972 --> 02:58:14,851
- Since I no longer hold the general's--
- I told you there is no time for that!

There is no time.

We need every man. God knows.

You must take what I have told you…

2232
02:58:44,422 --> 02:58:47,675
… and learn from it as a man does.

2233
02:58:49,177 --> 02:58:50,637
There has been a mistake.

2234
02:58:50,803 --> 02:58:53,806
It will not happen again.
I know your quality.

2235
02:58:53,973 --> 02:58:57,393
You are one of the finest cavalry officers
I have ever known…

2236
02:58:57,560 --> 02:59:01,272
… and your service to this army
has been invaluable.

… and found some more departed souls
down there…

for which they had no more use for.

It doesn't look like
they're planning to leave.

Retreat is no longer an option.

The enemy has been attacked
on both wings.

He has reinforced there…

2307
03:04:09,372 --> 03:04:12,458
… and is strongest there on the wings.
The hills and the rocks.

2308
03:04:12,625 --> 03:04:14,126
So the weak point is in the center.

Yes, sir, general.

2333
03:06:32,682 --> 03:06:34,225

But I think you are right about the flank.

03:06:38,354 --> 03:06:41,649
Hood and McLaws were both very badly
damaged yesterday.

They are stronger and rested.

at your command, including Pickett.

Your objective will be
that clump of trees yonder.

2340
03:06:58,749 --> 03:07:01,502
The attack will be preceded
by massed artillery.

2341
03:07:01,669 --> 03:07:05,005
We'll concentrate all of our guns
on that one small area.

2342
03:07:05,256 --> 03:07:08,050
A <i>feu d'enfer</i>, as Napoleon would call it.

2343
03:07:08,717 --> 03:07:12,513
When the artillery has had its effect,
your charge will break the line.

2344
03:07:12,680 --> 03:07:16,183
You will have nearly 15,000 men
at your command, general.

2345
03:07:16,517 --> 03:07:18,561
You may begin whenever you're ready.

2346
03:07:18,728 --> 03:07:21,522
But plan it well.
Do plan it well, I pray you, sir.

2347
03:07:21,730 --> 03:07:22,982
We stake everything on this.

2348
03:07:23,149 --> 03:07:25,693
Sir, with your permission.

2349
03:07:30,406 --> 03:07:32,741
Sir, I've been a soldier all my life.

2350
03:07:33,033 --> 03:07:36,162
I have served from the ranks on up.
You know my service.

2351
03:07:40,541 --> 03:07:44,128
I must tell you now,
I believe this attack will fail.

2352
03:07:49,008 --> 03:07:52,678
No 15,000 men ever made
can take that ridge.

2353
03:07:53,220 --> 03:07:55,848
It's a distance of more than a mile
over open ground.

2354
03:07:56,015 --> 03:07:58,392
When the men come out of the trees
they will be…

2355
03:07:58,767 --> 03:08:01,937
… under fire of Yankee artillery
from all over the field.

2356
03:08:02,104 --> 03:08:03,522
Those are Hancock's boys.

2357
03:08:03,689 --> 03:08:07,943
And now they have the stone wall
like we did at Fredericksburg.

2358
03:08:08,778 --> 03:08:10,738
We do our duty, general.

2359
03:08:11,572 --> 03:08:14,033
We do what we must do.

2360
03:08:14,200 --> 03:08:15,659
Yes, sir.

2361
03:08:17,578 --> 03:08:21,373
Colonel Alexander is in charge
of the artillery and he is very good.

2362
03:08:22,583 --> 03:08:27,087
We will depend on him to drive them off
the ridge before your divisions get there.

2363
03:08:27,588 --> 03:08:30,591
And the men will know what to do.
All 15,000…

2364
03:08:30,758 --> 03:08:34,720
… will concentrate squarely on the center
of that line. That lower ridge there.

2365
03:08:34,929 --> 03:08:37,097
The line is not strong there.

2366
03:08:37,348 --> 03:08:40,434
General Meade has great strength
on both flanks.

2367
03:08:40,893 --> 03:08:42,811
He must be weak in the center.

2368
03:08:42,978 --> 03:08:47,024
I estimate his strength in the center
not to be more than 5,000 men.

2369
03:08:47,274 --> 03:08:51,570
And Colonel Alexander's artillery
will break them up like at Fredericksburg.

2370
03:08:52,071 --> 03:08:53,822
- Yes, sir.
- Farewell.

2371
03:09:02,206 --> 03:09:03,749
What are you thinking, general?

2372
03:09:06,752 --> 03:09:08,712
Well, sir…

2373
03:09:08,879 --> 03:09:11,423
… Pickett's division is from my corps.

2374
03:09:11,590 --> 03:09:14,593
But the other two units
are of A. P. Hill's corps.

2375
03:09:18,973 --> 03:09:20,766
Shouldn't General Hill
lead the attack, sir?

2376
03:09:22,226 --> 03:09:23,269
Say again?

2377
03:09:25,479 --> 03:09:28,107
Shouldn't General Hill lead the attack?

2378
03:09:37,324 --> 03:09:38,617
My apologies, sir.

2379
03:09:43,414 --> 03:09:45,791
I've always been very cautious.

2380
03:09:46,208 --> 03:09:47,418
Very cautious.

2381
03:09:47,585 --> 03:09:49,628
There is no one I trust more.

2382
03:09:56,510 --> 03:09:59,638
Sir, if we can take that ridge…

2383
03:09:59,805 --> 03:10:02,182
We can. And we will.

2384
03:10:09,356 --> 03:10:12,359
General, God go with you.

2385
03:10:32,796 --> 03:10:34,632
George, you are leading attack.

2386
03:10:34,798 --> 03:10:36,342
Now get ready, George.

2387
03:10:36,508 --> 03:10:39,345
Take your men behind the line of trees.
I'll give you details later.

2388
03:10:39,511 --> 03:10:41,347
Now, move, George!

2389
03:10:41,805 --> 03:10:43,098
[YELLS]

2390
03:10:52,441 --> 03:10:54,193
[CHEERING]

2391
03:11:28,310 --> 03:11:31,271
[CHANTING]

2392
03:13:44,822 --> 03:13:45,948
Sir.

2393
03:13:46,115 --> 03:13:50,452
Forgive me the torn trousers, sir.
An officer riding around like this.

2394
03:13:50,994 --> 03:13:52,496
Colonel Alexander.

2395
03:13:53,163 --> 03:13:57,376
Those Federal cannon up on that
little rocky hill can cause some trouble.

2396
03:13:57,751 --> 03:14:00,462
I want you to assign some guns
and keep them silent.

2397
03:14:00,629 --> 03:14:01,713
Then…

2398
03:14:01,880 --> 03:14:04,591
… you move forward
when the infantry advance…

2399
03:14:04,758 --> 03:14:06,343
… keeping the flanks clear.

2400
03:14:06,552 --> 03:14:08,137
Porter, how old are you, son?

2401
03:14:08,303 --> 03:14:11,098
- Sir, I'm 28, sir.
- Uh-huh.

2402
03:14:12,307 --> 03:14:16,603
Porter, we must also clear those guns
off that low center ridge right there.

2403
03:14:16,770 --> 03:14:19,064
- That's the main thing.
ALEXANDER: Yes, sir.

2404
03:14:19,231 --> 03:14:22,484
LONGSTREET: I'm relying on you.
- I'll sure keep them shooting.

2405
03:14:22,651 --> 03:14:24,570
LONGSTREET:
Good. Good.

2406
03:14:24,945 --> 03:14:26,864
I want you to use everything you have.

2407
03:14:27,030 --> 03:14:29,366
Maximum effort.
Fire all long-range ordinance.

2408
03:14:29,533 --> 03:14:32,619
But don't open up till I give the word
and everything's in position.

2409
03:14:33,162 --> 03:14:36,790
Then fire with all you've got.
I don't want to see a single gun silent.

2410
03:14:36,999 --> 03:14:39,209
Find an observation point
and check the damage.

2411
03:14:39,376 --> 03:14:41,587
We must clear those people off that ridge.

2412
03:14:43,839 --> 03:14:45,215
If we don't…

2413
03:14:45,674 --> 03:14:49,177
Anyway, you let me know when you're
nearing the end of your ammunition.

2414
03:14:49,386 --> 03:14:53,140
We must conserve enough to support
the infantry attack. Is that clear?

2415
03:14:53,307 --> 03:14:54,349
Yes, sir.

2416
03:15:31,929 --> 03:15:33,639
Gentlemen.

2417
03:15:35,474 --> 03:15:38,310
Johnston Pettigrew,
University of North Carolina.

2418
03:15:39,436 --> 03:15:40,646
Yeah, I know.

2419
03:15:41,230 --> 03:15:44,274
They still talk about your grades there
with reverence and awe.

2420
03:15:44,441 --> 03:15:47,819
Your reputation as a scholar
has preceded you, sir.

2421
03:15:47,986 --> 03:15:49,488
I hear you've written a book.

2422
03:15:49,655 --> 03:15:52,741
It was only a minor work.
If the general would care to read it…

2423
03:15:53,367 --> 03:15:56,161
- Surely.
PETTIGREW: A copy with my compliments.

2424
03:15:56,328 --> 03:15:58,664
Captain, retrieve my book
from the baggage.

2425
03:15:58,830 --> 03:16:02,834
General, my apologies, but I do not believe
I will have time to read that today.

2426
03:16:04,962 --> 03:16:06,129
Gentlemen.

2427
03:16:07,631 --> 03:16:10,509
I want you to look
at that clump of trees on that ridge.

2428
03:16:12,094 --> 03:16:15,430
That is where all units will converge.

2429
03:16:15,597 --> 03:16:20,602
You will be spread out in a long line,
perhaps a mile, about 15,000 men.

2430
03:16:21,019 --> 03:16:24,523
All units converging on that point
on the crest of that ridge.

2431
03:16:25,148 --> 03:16:26,692
Now, look here.

2432
03:16:32,114 --> 03:16:34,449
The Yankee center. A stone wall.

2433
03:16:37,035 --> 03:16:38,620
A small grove of trees.

2434
03:16:40,455 --> 03:16:44,835
General Trimble, commanding
Pender's division, will be on the left.

2435
03:16:45,585 --> 03:16:47,713
Pettigrew's brigade in support.

2436
03:16:49,298 --> 03:16:52,718
General Pickett's division
will be on the right side of the attack.

2437
03:16:52,884 --> 03:16:56,847
And now, George,
I want you to put two brigades in front…

2438
03:16:57,097 --> 03:16:59,057
… and one in back, like so.

2439
03:16:59,599 --> 03:17:00,642
Yes, sir.

2440
03:17:01,935 --> 03:17:03,228
Garnett's brigade.

2441
03:17:03,395 --> 03:17:04,896
That's Jimmy Kemper.

2442
03:17:05,272 --> 03:17:07,065
Armistead's in support.

2443
03:17:07,983 --> 03:17:09,651
Good. All right, then.

2444
03:17:09,818 --> 03:17:11,903
Garnett will dress off at Trimble's flank.

2445
03:17:12,070 --> 03:17:15,490
And he will be the hinge, so to speak,
in a series of left obliques.

2446
03:17:16,408 --> 03:17:18,535
Somewhere about
the Emmitsburg Road…

2447
03:17:18,702 --> 03:17:21,621
… you will execute your first left oblique.

2448
03:17:21,788 --> 03:17:23,415
Then direct.

2449
03:17:23,582 --> 03:17:25,125
Then left again.

2450
03:17:25,292 --> 03:17:27,294
And so on at your own discretion…

2451
03:17:27,502 --> 03:17:31,798
… in order to deceive the Yankees
and spread them out in a long line.

2452
03:17:32,132 --> 03:17:33,550
Here. Any questions?

2453
03:17:35,719 --> 03:17:37,262
All right, gentlemen.

2454
03:17:40,932 --> 03:17:42,100
Gentlemen…

2455
03:17:42,267 --> 03:17:45,771
… that is the conversion point.
That clump of trees.

2456
03:17:46,438 --> 03:17:48,440
We will use all of the artillery.

2457
03:17:49,441 --> 03:17:52,778
They will center on that point,
right there.

2458
03:17:53,779 --> 03:17:57,157
Will fire every gun they have
until the ammunition runs out.

2459
03:17:58,200 --> 03:18:01,787
When that is done,
I will give the order and you all go in.

2460
03:18:08,168 --> 03:18:10,253
Gentlemen…

2461
03:18:11,380 --> 03:18:15,801
… I do believe this attack will decide
the fate of our country.

2462
03:18:17,052 --> 03:18:23,141
All the men who have died in the past
are with you here today.

2463
03:18:33,193 --> 03:18:38,490
I want to say, sir, it is an honor to serve
under your command.

2464
03:18:47,040 --> 03:18:50,544
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me
the opportunity of serving here.

2465
03:18:50,710 --> 03:18:53,255
I have prayed, sir.

2466
03:19:28,498 --> 03:19:31,376
George, can you take that ridge?

2467
03:19:47,934 --> 03:19:49,561
Sir.

2468
03:19:54,316 --> 03:19:55,525
Harrison.

2469
03:19:56,109 --> 03:19:59,070
Would you mind giving someone an order
to give me a musket?

2470
03:19:59,237 --> 03:20:01,239
I think today I'd like to join the attack.

2471
03:20:01,406 --> 03:20:05,869
If I could even borrow a hat from a soldier
or just a jacket with some stripes on it.

2472
03:20:07,496 --> 03:20:09,080
Sir, just once.

2473
03:20:09,247 --> 03:20:13,585
Because I think, sir,
today might be the last day.

2474
03:20:17,088 --> 03:20:18,924
Haven't I earned it, sir?

2475
03:20:22,719 --> 03:20:24,262
You know what's gonna happen?

2476
03:20:29,935 --> 03:20:32,270
I'll tell you what's gonna happen.

2477
03:20:34,189 --> 03:20:36,942
Troops are now forming
behind the line of trees.

2478
03:20:38,109 --> 03:20:44,366
When they come out, they will be under
enemy long-range artillery fire.

2479
03:20:44,533 --> 03:20:48,286
Solid shot. Percussion.
Every gun they have.

2480
03:20:49,913 --> 03:20:53,333
Troops will come out under fire
with more than a mile to walk.

2481
03:20:53,500 --> 03:20:55,460
And still, within the open field…

2482
03:20:55,627 --> 03:20:58,338
… they'll be in the range
of aimed muskets.

2483
03:21:11,977 --> 03:21:15,397
They'll be slowed down
by that fence out there.

2484
03:21:15,564 --> 03:21:20,318
And the formation,
what's left of it, will begin to come apart.

2485
03:21:21,319 --> 03:21:25,490
When they cross that road,
they'll be under short-range artillery.

2486
03:21:25,657 --> 03:21:27,158
Canister fire.

2487
03:21:27,534 --> 03:21:31,037
Thousands of little bits of shrapnel
wiping the holes in the lines.

2488
03:21:33,415 --> 03:21:36,001
If they get to that wall
without breaking up…

2489
03:21:37,168 --> 03:21:38,837
… there won't be many left.

2490
03:21:42,090 --> 03:21:43,925
A mathematical equation.

2491
03:21:46,553 --> 03:21:50,765
But maybe, just maybe…

2492
03:21:50,932 --> 03:21:53,435
… our own artillery will break up
their defenses.

2493
03:21:54,728 --> 03:21:56,438
There's always that hope.

2494
03:22:01,568 --> 03:22:05,697
That's Hancock out there.
And he ain't gonna run.

2495
03:22:07,615 --> 03:22:09,659
So it's mathematical after all.

2496
03:22:10,952 --> 03:22:17,083
If they get to that road, or beyond it,
we'll suffer over 50 percent casualties.

2497
03:22:21,296 --> 03:22:23,340
But, Harrison…

2498
03:22:25,133 --> 03:22:28,261
… I don't believe my boys will reach
that wall.

2499
03:22:39,689 --> 03:22:41,733
Sir, with your permission.

2500
03:22:45,403 --> 03:22:47,822
I'll get myself that musket, sir.

2501
03:22:59,250 --> 03:23:02,045
That's Meade's headquarters.

2502
03:23:02,212 --> 03:23:05,256
You're to take a position in reserve.

2503
03:23:05,423 --> 03:23:08,593
You don't have to entrench,
but please don't go away.

2504
03:23:08,760 --> 03:23:11,930
LAWRENCE: Major, do you have that?
SPEAR: Yes. I'll place the men.

2505
03:23:12,097 --> 03:23:15,934

to General Hancock. If you will follow me.

They tell me
you ordered a bayonet charge.

It's nothing to be ashamed of,
I might tell you.

I'm gonna look into it.

2515
03:23:49,092 --> 03:23:51,219
We need fighting men in this army.

we'll need some brigade commanders.

Now you tell me, professor.

2532
03:24:37,265 --> 03:24:39,934
Can you recall a story from antiquity
where two men…

2533
03:24:40,101 --> 03:24:42,187
… who are best of friends,
almost brothers…

2534
03:24:42,353 --> 03:24:45,815
… where these men find themselves,
by a trick of fate…

2535
03:24:45,982 --> 03:24:48,401
… on opposing sides in a great war?

2536
03:24:48,860 --> 03:24:50,862
Then, on a given day…

2537
03:24:51,029 --> 03:24:54,491
… find themselves facing one another
on the very same battlefield?

2538
03:24:56,868 --> 03:25:02,832
If the Greeks did not tell of such a story,
surely the Romans did.

2539
03:25:03,416 --> 03:25:06,044
But, sir, I think it must be found
in the Bible.

2540
03:25:06,503 --> 03:25:08,213
There isn't an officer on either side…

2541
03:25:08,379 --> 03:25:11,841

the other uniform. I know that.

But this morning…

2543
03:25:15,178 --> 03:25:17,722
… I looked through my glass
and saw the colors…

2544
03:25:17,889 --> 03:25:21,518
… of the 9th and 14th Virginia regiments
on those ridges before us…

2545
03:25:21,684 --> 03:25:23,811
… directly facing us, right over there.

2546
03:25:24,312 --> 03:25:26,773
It was as if I could hear his voice…

… see his old crumpled hat.

2548
03:25:31,110 --> 03:25:35,240
Armistead commands one of Pickett's
brigades and he's out there for sure.

I somehow thought this day
would never come.

There's nothing more you can do for me.

04:13:55,846 --> 04:14:02,310
But, General Lee, will you see to it
that full justice is done for my men…

2848
04:14:04,312 --> 04:14:06,648
… who made this charge today?

2849
04:14:07,691 --> 04:14:08,984
I will do so, sir.

2850
04:14:09,151 --> 04:14:11,027
Thank you, general.

2851
04:14:15,699 --> 04:14:17,367
Thank you, general.

2852
04:14:20,203 --> 04:14:21,705

Friends.

2857

It is all my fault.

Hear me.

Hear me, I pray you.

2860
04:14:40,599 --> 04:14:42,267
It is entirely my fault.

2861
04:14:42,434 --> 04:14:43,852
No.

Hear me.

04:14:45,353 --> 04:14:47,731
Hear me. Please, friends.

04:14:47,898 --> 04:14:50,025
We must rest now.

2865
04:14:50,192 --> 04:14:52,486
We must retire
and fight again another day.

2866
04:14:52,652 --> 04:14:54,863
And there will be another day.

2867
04:14:55,197 --> 04:14:57,782
Meanwhile, friends,
we must show good order.

Do you hear me?

Never let them see you run.

Let us hit them again.
Let us reform and hit them again.

2871

I know we can do it.

You may reform to the rear of this ridge

You must look to your division.
