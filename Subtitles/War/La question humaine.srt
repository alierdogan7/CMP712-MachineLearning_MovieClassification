1
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:08,786
HEARTBEAT DETECTOR

2
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,555
I worked for seven years
in a multinational company.

3
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:48,861
I'll call SC Farb.

4
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:56,465
It was a German company
with a large Parisian subsidiary.

5
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:03,742
I was the company psychologist
in the Human Resources Department.

6
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,342
I had two responsibilities:

7
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,581
staff selection

8
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:14,750
and running seminars for executives.

9
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:18,455
My seminars were based
on the new belief

10
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,932
that motivation
lay at the heart of productivity.

11
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,963
We used a combination of role play,

12
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,632
group dynamics,

13
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,904
and old oriental methods

14
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:38,040
which encouraged people
to push themselves to the limit.

15
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,818
I've seen grown men
cry like little boys.

16
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:47,859
I've seen people breaking down,
going into violent rages.

17
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:55,399
I had to guide them
towards my only goal:

18
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,561
making them soldiers,
knights of the business world,

19
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,606
highly competitive subalterns.

20
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,210
Hey, how are you doing?

21
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,246
How are you?

22
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:55,111
-You weren't at the coffee machine?
-I was afraid I'd be late.

23
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,551
Is there a meeting?

24
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,384
No. Don't worry.

25
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,151
Betrand sent us a postcard.

26
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,352
-Where is he?
-In Tokyo.

27
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,053
It's rained every day.

28
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,757
He doesn't care.
He's only there for the girls.

29
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,391
All they do is smile.
It gets annoying after a while.

30
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,130
He found a bar
with transparent floors

31
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,467
where he can check out
the waitresses' butts.

32
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,075
Then what does he do?

33
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,701
Nothing. You know him.

34
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,144
Have a nice day!.

35
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:40,163
The company was pulling itself
out of a difficult period.

36
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:44,359
A restructuring plan had forced
the closure of a production line.

37
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:49,134
Staff had been cut
from 2500 to 1200.

38
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,039
The management brought me in

39
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:57,582
to establish evaluation criteria
other than age and seniority.

40
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:01,244
But I'll come to my part
in this later.

41
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:07,053
It's too difficult to explain
chronologically.

42
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:18,732
Mr. Rose is sorry.
Do you mind waiting?

43
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,998
This way, please.

44
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,158
Come and sit down.

45
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:50,764
What I'm about to tell you
is completely confidential.

46
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:56,372
The head office has asked me
to sort out a worrying situation.

47
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,841
It's rather delicate.

48
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:04,172
How do you get on with the CEO?

49
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,518
I don't know him personally.

50
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,919
We see each other in meetings,
but apart from that,

51
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:15,027
all we do is say hello
and make small-talk.

52
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,494
We have a purely
professional relationship.

53
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,428
I said this was confidential.

54
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,434
As a psychologist, I'm sure
you know what that word implies.

55
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:30,531
You're the only person
I wish to speak with about this.

56
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,877
Concerns have been voiced

57
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:40,042
about what you might call
the "mental state" of our CEO.

58
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,519
They were brought to us
by one of his secretaries

59
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:48,320
and confirmed by some
worrying behavior at work.

60
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,229
I've known Mr. Jüst
for nearly 1 0 years.

61
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,732
We worked together
at our German HQ.

62
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,929
He hasn't seemed himself
for a while.

63
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,767
It's just a feeling,

64
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:06,868
but for those who know him,
the difference is striking.

65
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:10,972
I say "difference".
I hesitate to say "illness".

66
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:14,746
It's up to you to tell me.
You're the specialist here.

67
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,758
Mr. Jüst is a cornerstone

68
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,486
of our operation and recovery
in France.

69
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,688
The Germans want
a detailed report on him.

70
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:30,268
Like everyone else,
I fervently hope it's favorable.

71
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,531
You're free to proceed
as you see fit,

72
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:37,165
but this takes priority.

73
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,007
You'll obviously have
to get to know Mr. Jüst better.

74
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,978
I'll tell his secretary.

75
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:47,415
Be discreet.
She's still very fond of her boss.

76
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,658
I know, Mr. Rose told me.

77
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,823
Tomorrow, around 9:00 PM.

78
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,595
-Do you know the Café Beaubourg?
-Yes.

79
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,205
-Until tomorrow, then.
-See you tomorrow.

80
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:42,200
-Hello.
-Hi, Ali.

81
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,233
Put that poison out or I'm off.

82
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,565
You're right, it's gone.

83
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:29,940
If we went to your place
would you sing for me?

84
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,776
If you want.

85
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,781
What would you like to hear?

86
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:38,479
-Your voice.
-You're hearing it now.

87
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,354
I want to see you sing.

88
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,091
Do you do it at the piano?

89
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,161
Sometimes.

90
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,290
I do it standing up, too.

91
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,335
I can sing sitting or Iying down.

92
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,697
Why?

93
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,240
And naked?

94
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,154
Why not.

95
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:18,086
Like most people do,
in the shower or bath.

96
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,493
Being naked must make it....

97
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,827
It depends who it is.

98
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:30,098
If I'm naked with Schubert,
Fauré, or Mahler,

99
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,005
it's never the same.

100
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,339
You have to choose.

101
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,310
Have you chosen?

102
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,722
Yes.

103
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,052
Why are you laughing?

104
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,224
No reason.

105
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,262
-Let's go.
-I'll think about it.

106
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,096
Louisa!

107
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:14,918
Sorry?

108
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,852
Don't trust what people
see you in you.

109
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,319
You seem nice.

110
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,617
You should...

111
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,926
"April 12th,

112
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,726
April 1 7th, May 21st.

113
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,392
Late three times.
No excuse given.

114
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,367
June 3rd.

115
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,700
Taken ill in a board meeting.

116
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:13,540
Unable to read notes.
Says he has a migraine.

117
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,214
June...

118
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,444
...7th.

119
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:24,488
Shut himself in office all morning.
Doesn't answer phone.

120
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:27,114
Sound of water."

121
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,483
"September 2nd.

122
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:58,682
Signature changed to initials only.
Example included.

123
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,085
November 23rd.

124
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:04,354
Mr. Jüst complains
to cleaning company

125
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:07,693
that documents have been stolen.

126
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:12,101
Internal inquiry reveals no evidence.

127
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,535
Withdraws complaint.

128
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,304
February 6th.

129
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,378
Arrives an hour early for work.

130
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:23,106
Sits motionless in parking lot."

131
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,875
Shit!

132
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,417
"February 1 4th. 1 1:00 AM.

133
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:31,045
In an intoxicated state,
not confirmed.

134
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,183
June 5th.
Has trouble composing a letter.

135
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,660
November 2nd.
Replaces two private phones.

136
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:42,255
Suspects they have been tapped.

137
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,459
December 1 2th.

138
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,230
Has requested to change his name

139
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,068
from Jüst to Schlegel,
his mother's maiden name.

140
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,836
Request refused.

141
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:13,889
The first confidential file
covered Mathias Jüst's career.

142
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:18,663
I learned he entered the company
at 25 as an engineer.

143
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:22,740
He climbed the ranks becoming
deputy production manager

144
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,343
and finally CEO.

145
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:33,282
His CV was accompanied
by several photocopied files,

146
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:38,049
showing proof of a denunciation policy
within the company.

147
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,017
Thanks, Walter.
Call me at 6:00 PM.

148
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,677
Yes, Mr. Jüst.

149
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:40,035
Since restructuring,
we store all our data on computer:

150
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:46,709
staff changes, recruitment,
reports, lay-offs.

151
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:51,186
It'll be two years
until everything is computerized.

152
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,881
How far back can you go?

153
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,653
To the opening of our branch
in 1929.

154
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,455
They kept records back then?

155
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,188
Of course.

156
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:04,064
I found the files you asked for
on the Farb Quartet.

157
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,661
They last played together
eight years ago.

158
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,274
Have you been asked to look into it?

159
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,309
No. Why?

160
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:17,348
I had to get permission
to access the archives.

161
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,382
Really?

162
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:23,010
No, it's my own idea.

163
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:27,854
What would you think
of an orchestra in the factory?

164
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,484
Management is obviously interested.

165
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:34,292
Karl Rose gave his consent
immediately.

166
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:39,731
I hope it won't be old fogey music.
We want to get down!

167
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,930
You're good at that.

168
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:44,840
Why don't you come to our parties?

169
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,808
I did. Remember?

170
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,311
No. That's the point.

171
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:52,178
You came to two,
then played dead!

172
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,252
I get down but play dead!

173
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,785
You're annoying, Simon.

174
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,652
I don't mean to be.

175
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,241
Was it you who called me?

176
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,942
-Jacques Paolini?
-Yes.

177
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,551
We can talk in a café if you like?

178
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:40,453
I have very little time,
and even less to say to you.

179
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,492
Who told you about the quartet?

180
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,662
Some of the old guys who miss it.

181
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,320
Really?

182
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,899
The Farb Quartet
brings back bad memories.

183
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,059
What do you mean?

184
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,228
Take four cards:

185
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:57,204
a king, a queen, a jack,
and a six.

186
00:22:57,342 --> 00:23:00,243
Or a king of spades,
a ten of clubs,

187
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,314
a six of diamonds,
and a three of hearts.

188
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,245
You can't win.

189
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,352
You have to throw in your hand.

190
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,653
I'm sure you can guess the cards:

191
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:16,523
a CEO, a secretary,
a sales rep, and a chemist.

192
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,630
Music doesn't tolerate hierarchy.

193
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:22,766
The Franck quartet was a disaster.

194
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,064
Was Mr. Jüst the violinist?

195
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,195
How did he play?

196
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,937
He was extremely tense,
obsessively exact.

197
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,515
He was so meticulous
he stifled the music.

198
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:42,245
Perfectionism belies
an appalling fear of emptiness.

199
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,318
Why are you interested
in the Quartet?

200
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:49,223
Management has asked me
to come up with some ideas

201
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,726
for the events committee.

202
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:54,525
I thought it would be fun
to start an orchestra.

203
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:58,363
Forget it! Factory workers
don't like classical music.

204
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,368
Other stuff is better:

205
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:05,306
techno, house,
heart-pounding beats.

206
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,808
You must know about raves?

207
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,971
My son's at Polytechnique
That's all he listens to.

208
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,913
You can't be serious?
Techno at SC Farb?

209
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:14,416
Why not?

210
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:17,147
What does management listen to?

211
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,255
Violence is a thriving market,

212
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,949
a way to let off steam,

213
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:24,687
a kind of necessary ritual.

214
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:28,423
Remember getting ragged
when we were students?

215
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,536
I'm going. I'm late already.

216
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:51,550
Mr. Jüst would be mad
if he knew I was worried about him.

217
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,683
He's a very thoughtful man.

218
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,228
He has difficult moments
like everybody else,

219
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:02,492
personal problems.

220
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,829
Don't worry,
I'm here to help, not judge.

221
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:09,429
Everything you say
will remain between us.

222
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,373
Mr. Jüst sometimes gets very sad.

223
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,142
A terrible loss
he's never gotten over.

224
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,547
The sadness can last for months.

225
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:25,018
It's very painful,
but it's only human, isn't it?

226
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:26,453
Of course.

227
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,352
Sadness frightens people.

228
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,984
People avoid you like the plague.

229
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,359
Got a cigarette?

230
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:55,143
You close your eyes like a friend
I haven't seen in years.

231
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,152
Really?

232
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,189
A pianist.

233
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,349
A melancholic woman.

234
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,858
But I'm not sad!

235
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,191
Mr. Jüst isn't sad by nature.

236
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,823
Just now and then.

237
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,902
It's no big deal.

238
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,583
Mr. Tessier?

239
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:04,313
-Hello.
-Hello, come in.

240
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,723
-Hello, Mr. Tavera.
-Hello.

241
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,659
Please, come in.

242
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,665
All right.

243
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:25,643
We can talk for an hour
or longer if you wish.

244
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:28,974
I think an hour and a half
would be good.

245
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,103
All right.

246
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:40,217
Today's meeting has a dual purpose:

247
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:43,850
to get to know each other.

248
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:48,227
We'll focus less
on your work experience

249
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,527
and more on you as a person.

250
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,934
Your likings, aspirations,
and desires.

251
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,939
When we've finished,

252
00:27:57,075 --> 00:28:00,806
if you've any questions
about our company,

253
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,879
feel free to ask them.

254
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,505
I certainly will.

255
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:09,947
How would you like me to begin?

256
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,022
It's very simple.

257
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:17,356
If you had some close friends here,
who'd studied with you,

258
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:19,759
how would they describe you?

259
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:23,993
That's a surprising question.

260
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,239
My mother would say I was studious.

261
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:33,333
She made me join
a class for gifted children.

262
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:37,676
My girlfriend would say it didn't
prepare me for the real world.

263
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,182
What do you mean by that?

264
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:43,685
I can't cook.

265
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,915
Touching food makes me nauseous.

266
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:53,595
Have you tried to overcome it for her?

267
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,059
What does she do?

268
00:28:56,201 --> 00:29:00,069
We're not married.
We don't even live together.

269
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,765
For now, I'm concentrating
on my career.

270
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,670
Excuse me.

271
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,604
Yes?

272
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,213
It's me.

273
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:12,043
Hello, Mr. Jüst.

274
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:17,186
Yes, I'm researching
the Farb Quartet.

275
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:23,217
I have a few questions to ask.
I won't take up much of your time.

276
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,189
Fine.

277
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,529
Thank you.

278
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:40,542
You were talking
about your career.

279
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:46,812
Can you tell me why you've applied
for a job with us?

280
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:50,250
What do you expect
from the company?

281
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:54,654
There are more opportunities
for career advancement here.

282
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,728
You want to move up quickly?

283
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,659
Yes.

284
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,700
To be honest,
if I accept the job at Total,

285
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:07,168
I'd have a good profile
after a few years.

286
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:11,537
But I think that people
move up the ladder quicker here.

287
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:14,338
What makes you think that?

288
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:18,711
I asked around and read the trades.

289
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,785
This company
is a hi-tech industry leader,

290
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,946
so people get promoted quickly.

291
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:30,618
So your research has convinced you
that this is your best bet.

292
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:34,562
Yes, that's exactly
how I'd describe it.

293
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,221
How can I help you?

294
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:46,633
Since the restructuring,
I feel the staff need to bond,

295
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,966
to get together, have parties,

296
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:52,372
something that could even
involve families.

297
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:57,913
So, I'm looking into forming one
or more company orchestras

298
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,483
inspired by the quartet you formed.

299
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:01,652
Meaning?

300
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:05,017
26 employees on my list
play an instrument.

301
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:08,057
Most play piano,
but there are violinists,

302
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,319
percussionists, and guitarists.

303
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:12,395
I'd like to contact them

304
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,988
and ask if they'd like
to give some concerts.

305
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,068
Maybe you have some suggestions
for the repertoire?

306
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,364
How is your name spelled?

307
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:25,440
K-E-S-S-L-E-R,

308
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,271
Kessler.

309
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:34,415
You arrived here
after the Quartet broke up.

310
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,980
Who told you about it?

311
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:42,491
The senior executives
and Mr. Paolini, your cellist.

312
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,089
I've heard a lot
about your seminars.

313
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:51,862
It seems you get our executives
doing group therapy stuff, right?

314
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:54,631
Yes, amongst other things.

315
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:57,832
The company
can't be an abstract entity.

316
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,102
Its economic health

317
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:02,872
depends on its staff's physical
and mental health.

318
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:05,574
My goal is simple:

319
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:09,082
to push our executives
to their limits

320
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,748
and use this motivation
within the production unit.

321
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:18,260
Our executives
have to become competitive again

322
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:22,890
so that we can return
to our '92 -'97 production levels.

323
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:26,128
It's hard for some of them.

324
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,178
I'll have a look.

325
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:21,485
I may have a recording
in my own archives.

326
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,492
Fine.

327
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,861
Aimless wandering

328
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:41,275
In search of what you'll never find

329
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,813
A tramway from beginning to end

330
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:49,544
Meaningless journeys

331
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:56,991
And the bitterness of not knowing

332
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:03,361
Where to go or what to lean on

333
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,436
All you see are people

334
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,698
Who come and go

335
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,808
Unconnected

336
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,433
Almost crippled

337
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,741
By misery

338
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:21,980
By misery

339
00:35:55,353 --> 00:36:03,317
Sometimes life

340
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:09,127
Is like a fantasy

341
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:16,070
When you expect it least

342
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:24,979
It gives you what you wanted most

343
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:53,807
Even if it takes it away again
Afterwards

344
00:36:53,945 --> 00:37:02,148
If what I'm saying is a lie

345
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:05,813
If it's not the truth

346
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:16,297
May God punish me

347
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:40,187
May He punish me if he wants to

348
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:34,909
People who believe
Their way is right

349
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:39,506
Are easily lead astray

350
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:44,212
In the vile comedy of love

351
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:53,094
What good is a soul to us?

352
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,667
You're better off
Going your own way

353
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:01,761
Than lying to those you meet

354
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:10,943
What good is a soul to us?

355
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:19,182
You're better off
Going your own way

356
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,781
Yes?

357
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,357
Good evening.

358
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:28,454
I like to know you're alive

359
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,430
Now?

360
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,131
Why not?

361
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:38,400
I don't pursue my desires

362
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:47,051
He who clings to a dream
Because of one kiss

363
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:50,620
Only sees the flip-side of life

364
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:20,573
What exactly is your job?

365
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,551
You work for a big company,
but what do you do?

366
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,348
Why do you ask?

367
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,686
You're on call 24/7.

368
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,684
No I'm not.

369
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,352
Look what time they call you!

370
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:33,986
Don't those guys ever sleep?

371
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:35,155
Which guys?

372
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,062
Your boss.

373
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:41,168
My boss shouldn't have my number.

374
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,932
You don't have to go then.

375
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,041
Well, no...

376
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,305
...but I guess I will.

377
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,340
If it gets nasty, call me.

378
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:16,272
Maybe you don't know that love

379
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:20,838
Despite its own laws

380
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,271
Bewilders people's hearts

381
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,657
I didn't know you smoked.

382
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:46,702
I never smoke at work.

383
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:54,237
So...?

384
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:57,370
You visited the archive room.

385
00:41:58,482 --> 00:41:59,642
What did you think?

386
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,216
Fascinating.

387
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,745
In what way?

388
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:07,619
Archiving is fascinating by nature.

389
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:09,953
That's right.

390
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,721
Archive.

391
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,057
"Arkhé".

392
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:21,366
It's from where all things begin
and men command.

393
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:23,996
Where power is exercised.

394
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,541
Lucy, my wife.

395
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,304
This is Mr. Kessler.

396
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:30,242
-Hello.
-Good evening.

397
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,713
Some champagne? Whisky?

398
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,284
I'd love some champagne.

399
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:39,852
We're currently investing
a lot of money

400
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:44,256
in computerizing our archives.

401
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:48,126
What do we do
with this mass of information?

402
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,161
Who is it meant for?

403
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,794
Our successors, without doubt.

404
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:58,031
To history!

405
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:09,343
When we had the Quartet,

406
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:14,150
I never thought someone
would end up investigating it.

407
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,316
What kind of investigation
are you doing?

408
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,860
I'm not investigating.

409
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:29,295
Please, sit down.

410
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:36,911
Where were you born, Mr. Kessler?

411
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,139
In Strasbourg.

412
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,046
Do you like Paris?

413
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,620
I've lived here a long time.

414
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:48,883
You like music.
You must be a musician?

415
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:51,995
Unfortunately not.

416
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,154
Your wife perhaps?

417
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,664
I'm single.

418
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:03,464
Music is a virus.

419
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:05,973
I caught it when I was six.

420
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:08,905
I was taught by Zoltan Nemeth,

421
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:11,310
the greatest violin teacher
in Berlin.

422
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,678
He got up at 5:00 AM.

423
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:17,253
and did two hours of scales
before school.

424
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:22,024
At noon I studied for an hour,

425
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:26,287
and another hour and a half
before going to bed.

426
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:29,558
My mother kept things rolling.

427
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:35,736
The Quartet rehearsed
Tuesdays and Sundays.

428
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:38,740
My secretary was in it.

429
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:42,974
Paolini must have told you.

430
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:49,442
We tackled Dvorjak, Franck,
and even Schubert.

431
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:53,317
I didn't expect to find
this recording of us.

432
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:56,187
I haven't heard it for a long time.

433
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:33,118
The softest....

434
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:36,083
Music of the angels.

435
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,694
They all ganged up against me....

436
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,160
five, ten of them...

437
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:46,595
...it tears my body apart!

438
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:49,763
Stop!

439
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:11,885
Do you have much contact
with my deputy manager?

440
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:17,057
Is Karl Rose interested in your work?

441
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:20,830
He comes to my seminars
occasionally.

442
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:24,096
Where does his sudden interest
in music come from?

443
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:26,106
I don't know.

444
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,473
What do you mean?

445
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:32,873
Come and sit down.

446
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:44,250
I'm very concerned
about your department.

447
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:54,100
I'd like to talk to you
about a problem

448
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:55,500
that's tormenting me.

449
00:47:55,639 --> 00:48:00,440
I'm sorry, I have family commitments.
I'll have to go.

450
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:02,978
AIready?

451
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:04,808
Yes.

452
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,917
You would leave me here in torment?

453
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:11,379
I'm sorry, don't mind me.

454
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:13,148
Go on.

455
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,122
Walter will take you home.

456
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:20,162
-Good night, sir.
-Good night.

457
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:12,808
Go on ahead, Tavera.

458
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,475
Make sure we don't have
to wait in line!

459
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,890
You won't go far with that backpack.

460
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,434
You think you're in the AIps!

461
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,231
He wants a day off already!

462
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:00,488
Wait in line like everyone else!

463
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,500
Take off your sunglasses.
What are you playing at?

464
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:08,831
We're playing and not playing.

465
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:10,132
Philippe and I are shit.

466
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:11,934
Call us whatever you want.

467
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:13,736
He's the boss, our elder.

468
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:15,845
We owe him respect and obedience.

469
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:17,446
What's this bullshit?

470
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:21,415
There were rituals like this
in medieval European universities.

471
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:24,315
The Middle Ages are over.
Take off your fucking glasses.

472
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,581
-Back off!
-You're a pain in the ass!

473
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:30,056
One should never see
the boss's eyes.

474
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,854
Shut up!

475
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:34,995
Jump, Tavera!

476
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:36,394
Jump, asshole!

477
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,831
Stop, Simon! It's dangerous.

478
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,167
I've had it, scumbag boss!

479
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:49,976
He's gonna jump.

480
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,684
Let him do it.

481
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:02,215
Hey, shithead!
What the hell are you doing?

482
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:04,418
Sit the fuck down!

483
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,488
Simon, you want to go out?

484
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:40,721
What are you on? Are you crazy?
Come on let's go.

485
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:43,025
Who the hell are you?

486
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:45,600
What's wrong?
It's Isabelle.

487
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,465
Shut up! I don't know you, bitch!

488
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:50,664
Come on, we're leaving!

489
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:53,841
I don't want anyone to hear!

490
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,569
-What?
-Her voice.

491
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,009
I'm crazy about her voice.

492
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:59,138
So, what's the problem?

493
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:02,149
I don't want anyone
to hear Louisa's voice!

494
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:04,014
All those assholes watching her!

495
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:05,712
I'm watching her, too.

496
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:08,915
But you're blind.

497
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:11,993
-Have you watched her sing?
-Yes, so?

498
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:15,962
She's completely naked.
It drives me crazy.

499
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:19,262
All those assholes ogling her.

500
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:21,267
Stop, asshole!

501
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:20,956
Mrs. Jüst called on the flimsy pretext
that I'd forgotten my lighter.

502
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:24,116
I couldn't refuse her invitation.

503
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,991
I was completely wrapped up
in the story.

504
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:31,794
The anger that had surged
through me that night

505
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:38,272
was soothed by the blue eyes
of the woman talking to me.

506
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:42,139
As you must have seen,
my husband is not well.

507
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:47,445
Music is an insurmountable ordeal
for him.

508
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,553
He says he feels pain.

509
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:54,088
Knives slicing through his body.

510
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:56,350
That's what he says.

511
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:59,658
But....

512
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:02,490
what terrifies me are his eyes.

513
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:06,701
It's like he's lost control.

514
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,934
I want to show you something.

515
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:15,701
As I followed her,

516
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:19,212
the sight of her neck
gave me incredible pleasure.

517
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:21,249
I resisted.

518
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:25,582
I could have either kissed her
or bitten her.

519
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:29,289
He shuts himself
in his study at night.

520
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:32,952
I hear him pacing around
and talking to himself.

521
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:40,262
I wanted to take his handgun away
because he says dreadful things

522
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:43,668
but it's no longer in the drawer.

523
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:49,073
What a good dog.

524
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:51,237
What a dear dog.

525
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:53,349
Saphi.

526
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:06,926
The other day I caught him here.

527
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:13,234
He was sleeping on the floor
by our little Alo:ïs' crib.

528
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,430
Imagine his big body.

529
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,469
I took his hand.
He let me lead him away.

530
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:35,821
Mrs. Rose and I were great friends

531
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,017
but he stopped me from seeing her.

532
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:40,891
I think he's mad at Mr. Rose.

533
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,261
We were very close.

534
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:51,801
He doesn't think he's sick.

535
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:56,440
He says it's a plot.

536
01:01:56,579 --> 01:02:01,107
In your profession,
you call it paranoia, don't you?

537
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:08,452
Unless it really is a plot,
then why won't he talk about it?

538
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:12,789
Can you help me
to understand my husband?

539
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,131
What could I say?

540
01:02:17,266 --> 01:02:20,429
I promised to stay in contact,

541
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:24,597
and see her husband
before reaching a conclusion.

542
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,208
She seemed relieved

543
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:27,969
and watched from the front door

544
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:31,877
until my car disappeared
around the corner.

545
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:46,054
I thought we might
move the guy in product supply.

546
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:49,494
Yeah, that's it, Daragon.

547
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:55,628
And maybe put him
in product improvement

548
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,900
until Wednesday, or something.

549
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,100
Until he comes back.

550
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:06,838
I don't know.
I'll call you back.

551
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:09,611
Isabelle, do you want some coffee?

552
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:24,796
Shut up! I don't know you, asshole!

553
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:27,095
What's wrong?

554
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:28,635
Let go of me!

555
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:31,365
-You were at the rave on Saturday?
-Yes.

556
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:33,566
You were fighting with a girl, right?

557
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:35,643
What girl?

558
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:37,643
"Shut up! I don't know you, bitch!"

559
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,179
Remember?

560
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,646
No.

561
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:42,148
No, nothing.

562
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:45,220
I didn't say that to you!

563
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,952
Wait! Tell me....

564
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,136
Yes?

565
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:40,366
I was just leaving.

566
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:46,504
Fine.

567
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:14,670
The business world unforgiving.

568
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:20,976
How do you reconcile
"the human factor"

569
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:25,076
with the company's need
to make money?

570
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:31,754
How did you cope
with the restructuring process?

571
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:36,627
I was only indirectly involved.

572
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,166
Don't be so modest.

573
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:45,070
You played a major role
in the decision-making process.

574
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:47,175
Yes, I was there.

575
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:51,269
But you made the project a success.

576
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:54,713
You were the one behind it.

577
01:05:54,850 --> 01:06:00,584
Thanks to your dynamic
collaboration.

578
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:13,661
I asked you to refine
the employee evaluation criteria.

579
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:18,069
You really gave us your all.

580
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:25,773
We went from 2,500 units to 1,200.

581
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:27,712
We recovered our shareholders.

582
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:31,910
It was a huge success!

583
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:41,286
The quality of the files you presented
was most impressive.

584
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:46,495
You know exactly
how to define selection criteria

585
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:50,264
according to the company's needs.

586
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:56,103
That's your strength, Mr. Kessler.

587
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:04,947
I've never hesitated to hire
a candidate you put forward.

588
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:08,284
And I've never had cause to regret it.

589
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:14,726
Unfortunately,
others have made mistakes

590
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:17,765
which have caused us
serious financial damage.

591
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:21,336
It's their loss, too.
Recruitment costs money.

592
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:24,462
One has to accept
one's responsibilities.

593
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:28,872
I pay them to choose
the right people.

594
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:44,548
Today, there's not one alcoholic
left in the factory.

595
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:49,795
Before restructuring
we created special jobs for them

596
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:52,628
to be "charitable".

597
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:01,434
You had no qualms
about laying people off.

598
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:05,343
They gave us real safety problems
in some areas.

599
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,574
Of course.

600
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:14,144
You didn't give an inch
when the unions tried to intervene.

601
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:16,753
You stood your ground.

602
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:20,692
They didn't know the risk
we were running.

603
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,525
Keeping on sick workers.

604
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:25,293
AIcoholism is a sickness.

605
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:29,699
They'd be incapable of responding
to an emergency.

606
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:35,106
Imagine a vital pump breaking.

607
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:36,871
You have to react immediately.

608
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:41,346
There's no room for error.
The workshops are dangerous.

609
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:44,976
There's gas, hydrogen.
Disaster is always looming.

610
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:47,521
Safety regulations were ignored.

611
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:50,386
I've seen "specialists"
handling toxic products

612
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:52,220
without gloves or masks.

613
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:56,297
We've got hydrogen sulphide,
nitrogen oxide, phenol.

614
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:58,798
Take your pick!

615
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:01,835
And they blame it
on staff shortages.

616
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:02,731
Crap!

617
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:07,775
I just couldn't let it go,
for their safety and for ours.

618
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,174
And you were right!

619
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:35,430
I never noticed you worked
outside office hours.

620
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:46,842
I'm well aware that Karl Rose
told you to keep an eye on me.

621
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:50,985
He gave you this task.

622
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:56,417
He's turning my own people
against me.

623
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:02,221
Karl Rose has decided
to undermine me.

624
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:04,790
If he wants to get rid of me

625
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:12,067
it's because he knows
I've got some extremely serious,

626
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:17,305
confidential, and compromising
information.

627
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:26,947
Karl Rose used to be known
as Karl Kraus.

628
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:36,764
In 1 936, Heinrich Himmler
founded the Lebensborn movement,

629
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:41,461
literally, "source of life",

630
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:46,869
gathering from shelters
and maternity wards Aryan children,

631
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:50,410
many of whom were orphans.

632
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:52,104
By the end of the war,

633
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:55,081
these children had been adopted
by German families,

634
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:57,117
which was the case of Karl Rose.

635
01:10:57,319 --> 01:11:00,345
He is a "Lebensborn child".

636
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:02,980
It obviously isn't his fault.

637
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:10,130
He grew up in a family nostalgic
for the Schwarzen Orden,

638
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,791
and maintained dubious links

639
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:17,372
with people sharing
the same ideology.

640
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:20,805
I have concrete proof of this.

641
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:24,612
He sent donations
to a bogus company,

642
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:29,912
which passed them on
to an extreme right-wing group,

643
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:36,821
which had its own paramilitary cell.

644
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:41,156
I have all this information
at my disposal.

645
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,125
Do you understand now?

646
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:03,918
Now you can do as you like.

647
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:08,289
I've said everything I have to say.

648
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:16,891
How's your little orchestra going?

649
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:59,865
-Did I scare you?
-No.

650
01:13:58,167 --> 01:13:59,725
Where are you going?

651
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:30,692
What's wrong?

652
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:35,361
What's going on?

653
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,872
What's happening?

654
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:43,409
-Stop it!
-What?

655
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,746
My lover is a madman.

656
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:50,374
Look.

657
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:53,420
You're cold.
Dark as a prison.

658
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:57,051
Yes, now I'm scared.

659
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:07,961
The letter Rose sent me
filled me with unhealthy curiosity.

660
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:13,308
It looked like an ordinary
technical report,

661
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:16,967
full of production figures
and staff data.

662
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:20,377
Rose wanted to draw my attention
to the differences

663
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:23,883
between the version
written in German by Jüst

664
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:27,546
and the typed copy
obviously corrected by his secretary,

665
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:29,452
Lynn Sanderson.

666
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,791
Concern.

667
01:15:36,398 --> 01:15:37,956
Selection.

668
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:42,328
Reintegration.

669
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:50,837
Restructuring plan.

670
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,811
Relocation.

671
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:01,282
Concern.

672
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:03,220
Selection.

673
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:06,484
Reintegration.

674
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:09,854
Restructuring plan.

675
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:12,495
Relocation.

676
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:17,765
Reading the handwritten letter again,

677
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:21,535
I noticed that it was
full of missing words,

678
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:26,341
as if Jüst's mind
contained a censoring device

679
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:27,675
like a computer virus,

680
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:33,379
deleting certain words
and leaving blanks,

681
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:39,017
as if they belonged
to a forbidden, secret language.

682
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:59,104
One morning I was struggling
to complete a routine selection file.

683
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:01,511
It was the first time
I'd felt distaste,

684
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:04,517
even disgust for my job.

685
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,317
I called in sick with the flu.

686
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:12,655
Jüst's report is due
at the end of the week,

687
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:14,590
but I can't write a word.

688
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:22,967
I'm going to make a hole.

689
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:24,732
I need your cigarette.

690
01:17:24,873 --> 01:17:25,840
What?

691
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:28,375
Don't move.

692
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:31,877
I let it burn.

693
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:35,408
I push it well in.

694
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:58,165
Do it again.

695
01:18:00,776 --> 01:18:03,267
Annoying, isn't it?

696
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:12,551
Usually I only do it once.

697
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:15,854
Is it lit?

698
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:18,789
You're trying it on the cashmere?

699
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:23,663
Cashmere burns well.

700
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:32,070
It works the same way.

701
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,240
Don't move.

702
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:01,994
Oh, what's going on?

703
01:19:18,053 --> 01:19:19,350
I'll give you another one.

704
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:24,024
Good evening, gentlemen. Police!

705
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,650
Hands on the table!
Stop playing, please.

706
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:29,229
What did we do?

707
01:20:56,287 --> 01:20:57,720
Mathias!

708
01:21:39,897 --> 01:21:43,298
This accident
has really shaken me up.

709
01:21:43,868 --> 01:21:46,359
Have you spoken to the doctors?

710
01:21:46,504 --> 01:21:47,971
Yes, of course.

711
01:21:48,106 --> 01:21:49,596
But they were very discreet.

712
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:51,765
I didn't find out much.

713
01:21:52,910 --> 01:21:55,105
And Mrs. Jüst?

714
01:21:55,646 --> 01:21:58,444
She says her husband
is very sensitive.

715
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:04,078
Since their child's death,
he's had bouts of severe sadness.

716
01:22:04,222 --> 01:22:06,156
Of course.

717
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:11,592
You could have tried harder
to find out what really happened.

718
01:22:11,729 --> 01:22:16,792
Mrs. Jüst was very distressed.
I didn't want to press her further.

719
01:22:18,269 --> 01:22:24,139
Before this incident, what was
your clinical opinion of him?

720
01:22:24,275 --> 01:22:26,266
He's difficult to read.

721
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:29,641
He's highly principled
with a strong sense of duty.

722
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:32,374
A workaholic with a one track mind.

723
01:22:32,517 --> 01:22:35,008
He's suffering from exhaustion.

724
01:22:35,153 --> 01:22:37,053
Despite his hard exterior,

725
01:22:37,188 --> 01:22:41,454
he seems very sensitive
to what he calls the "human question".

726
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:44,792
Where did you meet?

727
01:22:44,929 --> 01:22:46,920
Here, in his office.

728
01:22:47,064 --> 01:22:49,794
-How many times?
-Twice.

729
01:22:50,001 --> 01:22:52,469
You mentioned a third meeting
just now.

730
01:22:53,104 --> 01:22:55,436
The first time was over the phone.

731
01:22:55,573 --> 01:23:00,169
As I said, I tried to find out more,
to ask more personal questions,

732
01:23:00,311 --> 01:23:01,505
but without success.

733
01:23:01,646 --> 01:23:02,738
He is very wary.

734
01:23:02,947 --> 01:23:05,279
You mean, he's paranoid?

735
01:23:05,416 --> 01:23:10,285
No, I meant his irascible nature

736
01:23:10,421 --> 01:23:12,514
makes it hard for him
to confide in people.

737
01:23:12,723 --> 01:23:16,352
He's just going through a hard time.

738
01:23:16,494 --> 01:23:20,191
He's got worries that might lead
to a personal crisis.

739
01:23:20,331 --> 01:23:22,561
The kind we've all been through.

740
01:23:22,767 --> 01:23:26,635
What do you mean,
"the kind we've all been through"?

741
01:23:26,771 --> 01:23:31,208
It's a phase more than a crisis.

742
01:23:31,409 --> 01:23:33,001
It's not depression.

743
01:23:33,144 --> 01:23:36,272
An ordeal.
That's a better way of putting it.

744
01:23:36,514 --> 01:23:37,640
Wait a minute.

745
01:23:37,782 --> 01:23:40,046
Is it a crisis or not?

746
01:23:40,618 --> 01:23:42,245
Depression or not?

747
01:23:43,821 --> 01:23:46,722
You mentioned exhaustion.
What kind?

748
01:23:47,892 --> 01:23:49,484
That's the impression I got.

749
01:23:49,627 --> 01:23:53,358
Maybe he just needs a vacation.

750
01:23:53,564 --> 01:23:59,161
There's a difference between clinical
exhaustion and needing a break.

751
01:24:01,405 --> 01:24:03,532
And his secretary?

752
01:24:06,811 --> 01:24:09,507
She doesn't think there's a problem.

753
01:24:11,382 --> 01:24:13,350
You must be joking!

754
01:24:14,185 --> 01:24:17,848
She's the one who first alerted me.

755
01:24:17,989 --> 01:24:21,254
She spoke of a breakdown,
depression,

756
01:24:21,392 --> 01:24:23,917
discrepancies in his work.

757
01:24:24,962 --> 01:24:29,763
If I brought you in,
it was to report on his mental decay.

758
01:24:29,967 --> 01:24:32,435
To be honest,

759
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:38,440
this assignment
is causing me great distress.

760
01:24:38,576 --> 01:24:41,545
What's making you pull back?

761
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:45,843
What are you keeping from me?
I want to know everything.

762
01:24:45,983 --> 01:24:47,245
Everything is in the file.

763
01:24:47,385 --> 01:24:50,354
You're contradicting yourself,
playing dumb and avoiding questions.

764
01:24:50,488 --> 01:24:53,457
I think the man's just tired.

765
01:24:53,591 --> 01:24:55,058
You're Iying.

766
01:24:55,192 --> 01:24:56,989
You lied about seeing him.

767
01:24:57,194 --> 01:25:00,163
-When?
-I know you saw him at his house.

768
01:25:00,298 --> 01:25:04,928
- I needed a clearer picture of him.
-What happened?

769
01:25:06,337 --> 01:25:08,430
Nothing. I just gave him a file.

770
01:25:08,572 --> 01:25:10,403
I don't understand your distress.

771
01:25:10,541 --> 01:25:13,567
You're not making yourself clear.

772
01:25:13,778 --> 01:25:16,440
By calling
a "personal crisis" a "phase",

773
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:19,845
you're either trying
to create a smoke screen

774
01:25:19,984 --> 01:25:24,387
or deliberately misleading me
with unrelated facts.

775
01:25:25,890 --> 01:25:28,984
I think I was wrong
in coming to you.

776
01:25:29,126 --> 01:25:33,119
I overestimated
your professional abilities.

777
01:25:33,264 --> 01:25:37,496
You're a dutiful subaltern
but you lack imagination.

778
01:25:43,541 --> 01:25:47,307
For a moment,
I saw him as Jüst had:

779
01:25:47,445 --> 01:25:49,970
Karl Kraus,
child of the Schwarzen Orden,

780
01:25:50,181 --> 01:25:51,773
nobody's child,

781
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:54,680
one of another breed of children,

782
01:25:54,819 --> 01:25:56,912
all perfect and alike.

783
01:25:57,054 --> 01:26:01,320
A child with no childhood,
no heart, no soul, no descendants.

784
01:26:01,525 --> 01:26:04,653
A child from the new, pure,
technical generation.

785
01:26:23,814 --> 01:26:27,807
For over a year, Karl Rose
has been blackmailing me.

786
01:26:27,952 --> 01:26:31,251
I couldn't stand it anymore.
I betrayed Mathias.

787
01:26:31,389 --> 01:26:36,986
I was afraid of reprisals
and his state of health scared me.

788
01:26:41,432 --> 01:26:44,765
It's kind of you
to have come so quickly.

789
01:26:44,902 --> 01:26:48,531
You sounded worried on the phone.

790
01:26:51,876 --> 01:26:57,371
I was Mathias' girlfriend
at the time of the Quartet.

791
01:26:57,515 --> 01:26:59,142
We grew apart

792
01:26:59,283 --> 01:27:03,219
because of his unpredictable
and violent behavior.

793
01:27:03,354 --> 01:27:06,846
He drove me home after rehearsals.

794
01:27:06,991 --> 01:27:10,586
I found poetic letters
he had left me.

795
01:27:15,065 --> 01:27:18,000
Mathias was an anxious,
possessive lover,

796
01:27:18,135 --> 01:27:21,536
obsessed with the idea
that we'd be caught.

797
01:27:25,176 --> 01:27:27,440
I loved Mathias.

798
01:27:28,078 --> 01:27:32,310
He's been nursing his sorrow
for so long.

799
01:27:32,450 --> 01:27:34,611
I've often seen him cry.

800
01:27:34,752 --> 01:27:37,812
I still love the inconsolable child
in him.

801
01:27:37,955 --> 01:27:39,946
His wife was at the hospital.

802
01:27:40,090 --> 01:27:41,853
Did she tell you what happened?

803
01:27:41,992 --> 01:27:43,823
Not really.

804
01:27:43,961 --> 01:27:45,861
I think he passed out.

805
01:27:45,996 --> 01:27:48,396
You're not telling me the truth.

806
01:28:28,906 --> 01:28:30,669
Mathias' father was called Théodor.

807
01:28:30,808 --> 01:28:33,743
During the war
he was in a police battalion.

808
01:28:33,878 --> 01:28:35,175
He collaborated with the SS

809
01:28:35,312 --> 01:28:39,248
during the occupation
in Poland and Belarus.

810
01:28:39,383 --> 01:28:41,817
He did more
than just administrative tasks.

811
01:28:41,952 --> 01:28:43,783
There were many Jews there.

812
01:28:43,921 --> 01:28:48,119
He was involved in relocating them,

813
01:28:48,259 --> 01:28:50,454
if you see what I mean.

814
01:28:51,629 --> 01:28:53,654
Got a cigarette?

815
01:29:01,272 --> 01:29:05,106
Mathias never knew
exactly what his father did.

816
01:29:05,242 --> 01:29:08,336
But he did witness
one precise event.

817
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:15,009
One day in the early '50s,
he was eating out with his father.

818
01:29:15,152 --> 01:29:17,643
A man recognized Théodor Jüst.

819
01:29:17,788 --> 01:29:19,722
He came and spoke to him.

820
01:29:19,857 --> 01:29:21,757
Théodor pretended not to hear him,

821
01:29:21,892 --> 01:29:24,827
but the boy remembered
what the man said.

822
01:29:24,962 --> 01:29:28,625
"I saw you in Miedzyrzec
in October '42.

823
01:29:28,766 --> 01:29:31,701
There were women and children
Iying by the cemetery wall.

824
01:29:31,835 --> 01:29:33,803
Remember?"

825
01:29:33,938 --> 01:29:37,931
Théodor Jüst got up,
grabbed his son and left.

826
01:29:38,075 --> 01:29:41,977
Next day, the man was waiting
outside the school.

827
01:29:42,112 --> 01:29:46,105
He gave Mathias a note
addressed to his father.

828
01:29:47,384 --> 01:29:49,978
The boy couldn't resist reading it.

829
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,954
"Miedzyrzec, 88 - 1 3".

830
01:29:54,091 --> 01:29:56,525
A place and some figures.

831
01:29:56,660 --> 01:30:01,393
He asked his father,
"Where's Miedzyrzec?

832
01:30:01,532 --> 01:30:04,399
What is 88 - 1 3?"

833
01:30:04,535 --> 01:30:07,800
His father beat him,
shut him in the cellar,

834
01:30:07,938 --> 01:30:10,168
yelled death threats
through the door.

835
01:30:10,307 --> 01:30:13,936
One day in the bathroom,
he tried to drown him.

836
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:18,410
The child wondered what the bodies
were doing face down on the ground.

837
01:30:18,549 --> 01:30:21,814
"Daddy, there were
women and children

838
01:30:21,952 --> 01:30:23,681
Iying by the cemetery.

839
01:30:23,821 --> 01:30:26,016
What were the bodies doing there?

840
01:30:26,156 --> 01:30:29,125
What were the 13 children doing?

841
01:30:29,326 --> 01:30:31,351
Daddy, what were the bodies doing?

842
01:30:31,495 --> 01:30:33,759
The 88 women on the ground?

843
01:30:33,897 --> 01:30:37,458
The 88 bodies, the 88 children?

844
01:30:37,601 --> 01:30:40,092
Were the children dead?"

845
01:31:24,548 --> 01:31:27,847
I can feel it.

846
01:31:27,985 --> 01:31:29,976
It's going to fall.

847
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:31,951
I can feel it's going to snow.

848
01:31:32,089 --> 01:31:33,113
It will be beautiful.

849
01:31:33,257 --> 01:31:35,521
Hello, sir.

850
01:31:36,126 --> 01:31:38,651
Do you have a cigarette?

851
01:31:40,798 --> 01:31:43,733
Come with me, please.

852
01:31:43,867 --> 01:31:45,562
Come with me.

853
01:31:48,472 --> 01:31:51,600
I'm happy you came.

854
01:31:54,211 --> 01:31:58,648
I couldn't ask Lucy.

855
01:32:12,830 --> 01:32:14,161
Here.

856
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:18,566
Apart from you, I don't know who....

857
01:32:22,172 --> 01:32:24,367
It's pure lies.

858
01:32:24,508 --> 01:32:29,707
You'll see how spiteful men can be.

859
01:32:31,315 --> 01:32:34,375
-Should I read them?
-Do what you like.

860
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:38,683
It's worthless.

861
01:32:43,093 --> 01:32:46,551
A disgusting, repugnant past.

862
01:32:49,266 --> 01:32:50,858
Lies.

863
01:32:52,002 --> 01:32:54,527
My father wasn't in Berlin
at the time.

864
01:32:54,671 --> 01:32:56,502
He wasn't a technician.

865
01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:00,906
He was just a shopkeeper
in Hamburg.

866
01:33:01,044 --> 01:33:05,276
He was forced to enlist
in a Polish battalion

867
01:33:05,415 --> 01:33:07,679
in the east of the country.

868
01:33:09,153 --> 01:33:11,883
I have nothing to do with this.

869
01:33:26,703 --> 01:33:30,104
The envelope contained three letters.

870
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:33,835
Jüst had kept them on him.

871
01:33:33,977 --> 01:33:38,437
They were anonymous,
posted in Le Mans.

872
01:33:38,582 --> 01:33:43,076
The first, sent a year ago,
well-known to Shoah historians.

873
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:47,850
Enclosed was a facsimile
of a memo written by an engineer,

874
01:33:47,991 --> 01:33:50,585
dated June 5th, 1942,

875
01:33:50,727 --> 01:33:54,424
stamped, "Secret: Affairs of State".

876
01:33:55,566 --> 01:33:58,126
"Since December 1 941,

877
01:33:58,268 --> 01:34:02,034
97,000 have been processed
in exemplary fashion

878
01:34:02,172 --> 01:34:06,165
using three vans,
without any sign of defect.

879
01:34:06,310 --> 01:34:11,907
The explosion in Kulmhof
should be seen as an isolated case

880
01:34:12,049 --> 01:34:15,075
caused by an operational error.

881
01:34:15,219 --> 01:34:17,983
Special instructions
have been addressed

882
01:34:18,121 --> 01:34:22,717
to the services concerned
to avoid such incidents.

883
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:24,586
One:

884
01:34:24,728 --> 01:34:28,687
To facilitate rapid distribution
of carbon monoxide,

885
01:34:28,832 --> 01:34:30,925
without pressure build-up,

886
01:34:31,068 --> 01:34:35,334
two 10-centimeter vents will be made
at the top of the rear wall.

887
01:34:35,472 --> 01:34:39,909
These vents will be fitted
with adjustable metal valves.

888
01:34:40,043 --> 01:34:41,510
Two:

889
01:34:41,645 --> 01:34:43,738
The normal load capacity

890
01:34:43,881 --> 01:34:47,317
is from 9 to 10 pieces
per meter squared.

891
01:34:49,186 --> 01:34:53,555
But the large Saurer vans cannot be
used for that many.

892
01:34:53,690 --> 01:34:55,521
The problem is not
one of overloading,

893
01:34:55,659 --> 01:35:02,155
but the effect of maximum loading
on the vehicle's maneuverability.

894
01:35:02,299 --> 01:35:03,857
It therefore seems necessary

895
01:35:04,001 --> 01:35:06,970
to reduce the cargo area
by one meter.

896
01:35:07,104 --> 01:35:09,902
Reducing the number of pieces
as we've been doing

897
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:11,632
is not the answer

898
01:35:11,775 --> 01:35:15,768
because the empty space must also
be filled with carbon monoxide.

899
01:35:21,985 --> 01:35:25,978
The manufacturer pointed out

900
01:35:26,123 --> 01:35:29,820
that making the van shorter
at the rear

901
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:34,090
would cause the cargo
to shift towards the front,

902
01:35:34,231 --> 01:35:36,597
and might overload the axle.

903
01:35:36,733 --> 01:35:38,633
In fact,

904
01:35:38,769 --> 01:35:44,366
there is a natural compensation
in the distribution of the load.

905
01:35:47,144 --> 01:35:49,612
There is a natural compensation
in the distribution of the load

906
01:35:49,746 --> 01:35:53,409
caused by the fact
that during the operation,

907
01:35:53,550 --> 01:35:57,714
the load tends to force
its way towards the rear doors

908
01:35:57,854 --> 01:36:03,156
and ends up Iying in this area.

909
01:36:03,293 --> 01:36:07,320
Consequently, the front axle
is not overloaded.

910
01:36:07,831 --> 01:36:09,162
Three:

911
01:36:09,299 --> 01:36:13,292
The pipe that connects
the exhaust to the van

912
01:36:13,437 --> 01:36:17,066
tends to rust because
it is eaten away from the inside

913
01:36:17,207 --> 01:36:19,869
by liquids that flow into it.

914
01:36:20,510 --> 01:36:26,210
Pointing the nozzle downward
prevents this from happening.

915
01:36:26,350 --> 01:36:27,874
Four:

916
01:36:28,018 --> 01:36:29,986
To facilitate cleaning,

917
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:34,113
a watertight drain
will be installed in the floor.

918
01:36:34,257 --> 01:36:36,851
The cover of the 20 to 30
centimeter opening

919
01:36:36,994 --> 01:36:39,155
will be fitted with an elbow siphon

920
01:36:39,296 --> 01:36:44,324
to allow for the drainage
of thin liquids during the operation.

921
01:36:44,468 --> 01:36:47,562
Thicker dirt will be disposed of

922
01:36:47,704 --> 01:36:50,639
through the large drainage hole
during cleaning.

923
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:57,712
To enable this,
the floor can be tipped slightly.

924
01:36:57,848 --> 01:36:58,746
Five:

925
01:36:58,882 --> 01:37:02,750
The observation windows can be
eliminated as they're rarely used.

926
01:37:02,886 --> 01:37:05,684
This will save a great deal of money.

927
01:37:05,822 --> 01:37:06,846
Six:

928
01:37:06,990 --> 01:37:09,754
Grills should cover
the lamps high enough

929
01:37:09,893 --> 01:37:12,293
to make it impossible
to break the bulbs.

930
01:37:12,429 --> 01:37:15,626
Experience shows
they can be done away with.

931
01:37:15,766 --> 01:37:20,430
However, when the back door
is closed and it gets dark inside,

932
01:37:20,570 --> 01:37:24,131
the load pushes hard
against the door.

933
01:37:24,274 --> 01:37:27,266
This is because
the merchandise rushes

934
01:37:27,411 --> 01:37:31,211
towards what little light remains
as it gets dark.

935
01:37:31,348 --> 01:37:34,408
This hampers the locking of the door.

936
01:37:35,218 --> 01:37:39,917
It has been noticed that the fear
aroused by the darkness,

937
01:37:40,057 --> 01:37:45,359
provokes screaming
when the doors are locked.

938
01:37:45,495 --> 01:37:47,929
It seems expedient
to keep the lights on

939
01:37:48,065 --> 01:37:51,057
before and during
the start of the operation.

940
01:37:51,201 --> 01:37:54,329
Lighting is also useful
for night work

941
01:37:54,471 --> 01:37:57,269
and for cleaning the van."

942
01:37:57,407 --> 01:37:59,671
You can't sleep here.

943
01:38:00,444 --> 01:38:02,139
I'm not asleep.

944
01:38:02,279 --> 01:38:04,474
You must have fainted then.

945
01:38:04,614 --> 01:38:07,014
-Really?
-Come on.

946
01:38:09,719 --> 01:38:11,619
Thank you.

947
01:38:11,755 --> 01:38:13,222
Come and drink something.

948
01:38:13,356 --> 01:38:15,586
No, I'm fine.

949
01:38:15,725 --> 01:38:18,319
-I should call a doctor.
-No, thank you.

950
01:38:18,462 --> 01:38:21,022
-Where do you live?
-Nearby.

951
01:38:21,164 --> 01:38:23,962
The memo had been submitted
for examination and decision

952
01:38:24,101 --> 01:38:27,264
to SS-Obersturmbannführer Rauff.

953
01:38:27,404 --> 01:38:31,966
It had been signed:
"By order of Jüst. "

954
01:41:17,374 --> 01:41:19,001
Feeling better?

955
01:41:20,944 --> 01:41:24,107
What did you mean
by "black as a prison."

956
01:41:24,247 --> 01:41:25,976
Why did you say that?

957
01:41:27,651 --> 01:41:30,779
You frightened me.
I thought you were going mad.

958
01:41:32,155 --> 01:41:33,747
We kissed.
We wanted each other.

959
01:41:33,890 --> 01:41:35,915
We were going upstairs....

960
01:41:36,059 --> 01:41:38,391
And then you remembered your mail.

961
01:41:39,396 --> 01:41:40,294
You went to get it.

962
01:41:40,430 --> 01:41:42,830
When you came back,
you had changed.

963
01:41:42,966 --> 01:41:46,902
You were a different man. Cold.

964
01:41:47,037 --> 01:41:48,504
You really hurt my wrists.

965
01:41:48,638 --> 01:41:51,038
It was the other guy that did it.

966
01:41:51,174 --> 01:41:54,337
He must have been hiding
in the hallway.

967
01:41:54,477 --> 01:41:57,446
He appeared out of nowhere.

968
01:41:58,181 --> 01:42:00,308
Louisa, I....

969
01:42:04,287 --> 01:42:08,053
Let's go back to before the mail.

970
01:42:09,893 --> 01:42:11,986
I touched your breast.

971
01:42:12,128 --> 01:42:16,929
With my other hand, remember,
I was stroking your back.

972
01:42:17,067 --> 01:42:22,164
I felt you against me,
pressing against my stomach.

973
01:42:22,305 --> 01:42:24,569
I took you in my hand.

974
01:42:34,951 --> 01:42:37,146
When I was a child,

975
01:42:37,287 --> 01:42:43,851
I'd close my eyes and see the sun
through my eyelids.

976
01:42:43,993 --> 01:42:48,487
It was red, frightening,
like an explosion.

977
01:42:53,703 --> 01:42:56,331
I could no longer feel Louisa's body.

978
01:42:56,473 --> 01:42:59,169
I clung onto her flesh.

979
01:42:59,843 --> 01:43:01,811
I could no longer see her eyes.

980
01:43:01,945 --> 01:43:06,814
A face without a mouth.
A sort of body without arms or legs.

981
01:43:21,264 --> 01:43:23,664
The second letter Jüst had given me

982
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:27,463
was composed of pieces
from the 1942 report,

983
01:43:27,604 --> 01:43:32,632
pulled apart, broken up,
deconstructed.

984
01:43:32,776 --> 01:43:36,507
The words were scattered
over a sheet of music.

985
01:43:36,646 --> 01:43:41,583
I didn't know it but I held the proof
of the sender's identity.

986
01:43:45,722 --> 01:43:48,748
What's the good news,
Mr. Corporate Shrink?

987
01:43:48,892 --> 01:43:50,120
Hello, Mr. Paolini.

988
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:52,421
Whisky, wine, pastis.

989
01:43:52,562 --> 01:43:54,086
Whisky.

990
01:43:56,366 --> 01:44:02,828
It's not my office, but it's better
than in that busy cafeteria.

991
01:44:11,915 --> 01:44:14,440
Have you ever played this piece?

992
01:44:20,557 --> 01:44:22,320
It's short.

993
01:44:23,159 --> 01:44:26,526
It must be the Franck,
the second movement.

994
01:44:26,663 --> 01:44:27,994
We had a go at it.

995
01:44:28,131 --> 01:44:30,531
May the composer forgive us.

996
01:44:32,969 --> 01:44:35,369
Why are you so obsessed
by the Farb Quartet?

997
01:44:35,505 --> 01:44:41,569
As I told you,
I'm forming a little orchestra.

998
01:44:41,711 --> 01:44:45,841
If I organized a concert this summer,
would you take part?

999
01:44:45,982 --> 01:44:48,746
What an appalling idea!
Here? No!

1000
01:44:48,885 --> 01:44:51,547
I've always hated company parties.

1001
01:44:51,688 --> 01:44:55,146
They make me think of mass burials.

1002
01:44:56,292 --> 01:44:59,284
I thought the young executives
could meet the old boys.

1003
01:44:59,429 --> 01:45:01,989
They were all really fond
of the quartet.

1004
01:45:02,131 --> 01:45:04,531
Which old boys?

1005
01:45:04,667 --> 01:45:07,761
The few that are left
have forgotten it

1006
01:45:07,904 --> 01:45:10,395
or have gone deaf by now.

1007
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:12,974
The quartet was total crap.

1008
01:45:13,109 --> 01:45:14,371
You're Iying.

1009
01:45:14,511 --> 01:45:16,172
No one would have talked about us.

1010
01:45:16,312 --> 01:45:19,338
Yes, Lynn Sanderson did.

1011
01:45:19,916 --> 01:45:23,477
She was madly in love!
She couldn't hear a thing.

1012
01:45:23,620 --> 01:45:28,114
We only had one real musician,
Arie Neumann.

1013
01:45:28,258 --> 01:45:30,192
He was great.

1014
01:45:30,326 --> 01:45:32,260
He came from marketing.

1015
01:45:32,395 --> 01:45:36,354
He was laid off
during the restructuring program.

1016
01:45:36,499 --> 01:45:39,366
He was an amazing guy.

1017
01:45:39,502 --> 01:45:42,335
-Lynn never mentioned him?
-No.

1018
01:45:43,106 --> 01:45:45,973
The quartet broke up when
he stopped coming to rehearsals.

1019
01:45:46,109 --> 01:45:48,339
Did you stay in touch?

1020
01:45:48,478 --> 01:45:51,606
No, I don't know
what happened to him.

1021
01:49:00,670 --> 01:49:02,695
Why aren't you answering?

1022
01:49:02,839 --> 01:49:04,932
You have clients.
Have you seen the time?

1023
01:49:05,074 --> 01:49:07,508
You're right. It's stupid.

1024
01:49:07,643 --> 01:49:09,110
Shall we go?

1025
01:49:17,553 --> 01:49:20,579
Mr. Paolini, let's go somewhere else.
It's hell here.

1026
01:49:20,723 --> 01:49:23,055
I don't have the time, I'm sorry.

1027
01:49:23,192 --> 01:49:25,160
I just got this letter.

1028
01:49:25,294 --> 01:49:28,286
It was addressed to me personally.

1029
01:49:28,431 --> 01:49:30,763
At least look at it.

1030
01:49:32,001 --> 01:49:34,697
Why don't you sign
the letters you send?

1031
01:49:34,837 --> 01:49:37,931
Do you find
this revolting game funny?

1032
01:49:38,074 --> 01:49:39,666
I didn't write it.

1033
01:49:39,809 --> 01:49:42,471
Please stop bothering me.

1034
01:49:47,083 --> 01:49:50,519
I've received a second
anonymous letter,

1035
01:49:50,653 --> 01:49:53,121
this time at my home.

1036
01:49:53,256 --> 01:49:57,818
I'm angry and frightened.

1037
01:49:58,561 --> 01:50:05,330
Like the letters sent to Mathias Jüst,
it was posted in Le Mans.

1038
01:50:05,468 --> 01:50:10,337
It mostly consists of ordinary phrases

1039
01:50:10,473 --> 01:50:14,569
taken from a corporate psychology
manual that I know well,

1040
01:50:14,710 --> 01:50:18,612
but invaded and devoured
by another text.

1041
01:50:18,748 --> 01:50:21,581
I can see a clear allusion to my job

1042
01:50:21,717 --> 01:50:24,743
and my contribution
to the eradication of all those

1043
01:50:24,887 --> 01:50:31,918
whom I judged affected
by alcoholism, absenteeism

1044
01:50:32,061 --> 01:50:37,363
and unable to meet
the company's criteria.

1045
01:50:45,174 --> 01:50:50,009
"Any element unfit for work
will be dealt with accordingly

1046
01:50:50,146 --> 01:50:55,448
in line with the objective criteria
as one deals with a sick limb.

1047
01:50:55,585 --> 01:50:57,951
We'll bear in mind items such as:

1048
01:50:58,087 --> 01:50:59,213
1. Age.

1049
01:50:59,355 --> 01:51:00,982
2. Absenteeism.

1050
01:51:01,123 --> 01:51:05,355
3. Adaptability
according to ability/convertibility

1051
01:51:05,494 --> 01:51:09,328
not forgetting the regularly
updated evaluation codes.

1052
01:51:09,465 --> 01:51:12,957
It must be remembered
that faulty individuals

1053
01:51:13,102 --> 01:51:19,940
may have a negative influence
on their successors.

1054
01:51:20,443 --> 01:51:25,039
Security checks will employ
modern electronic technology

1055
01:51:25,181 --> 01:51:33,213
to detect stowaways and other
undesirable elements in the vans

1056
01:51:33,356 --> 01:51:40,023
by picking up carbon gas emissions
in the breath.

1057
01:51:40,630 --> 01:51:48,503
We've recently installed
heart-beat detectors,

1058
01:51:48,638 --> 01:51:50,765
which are more efficient,

1059
01:51:50,907 --> 01:51:56,470
and enable us
to detect signs of life.

1060
01:51:58,381 --> 01:52:02,147
The device will examine
each vehicle.

1061
01:52:02,285 --> 01:52:05,550
No one can escape it.

1062
01:52:06,589 --> 01:52:10,753
7,000 have been picked up
since the beginning of the year.

1063
01:52:12,228 --> 01:52:16,460
The engineers are pleased
with their results.

1064
01:52:20,403 --> 01:52:23,839
We used to arrest 230 per day.

1065
01:52:23,973 --> 01:52:26,498
This figure has now dropped
to 160 a month,

1066
01:52:26,642 --> 01:52:32,239
thanks to increased Franco-British
collaboration in this field.

1067
01:52:33,683 --> 01:52:37,983
Our operation
will progressively spread

1068
01:52:38,120 --> 01:52:44,150
to all French and English ports
affected by the same problems."

1069
01:52:52,835 --> 01:52:57,272
I found this article in a daily paper
from February 2006.

1070
01:55:08,237 --> 01:55:10,899
Here you are.
Enjoy your meal.

1071
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:12,667
Thank you.

1072
01:55:13,709 --> 01:55:15,836
A beer, please.

1073
01:55:49,278 --> 01:55:52,475
-News from Patrice?
-He got attacked.

1074
01:55:52,615 --> 01:55:55,311
-And?
-He's going to report it.

1075
01:55:55,451 --> 01:55:57,009
He's right.

1076
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:08,991
Good-bye.

1077
01:56:45,901 --> 01:56:48,062
What's wrong with him?

1078
01:56:48,204 --> 01:56:51,105
Bladder stones.
It's something cats get.

1079
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:54,676
Couldn't you have prevented it?

1080
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:57,472
No, you can't do much about it.

1081
01:56:57,613 --> 01:56:59,979
AImost all cats get them.

1082
01:57:00,115 --> 01:57:02,083
I know, but....

1083
01:57:02,218 --> 01:57:05,119
After a certain age,
it's bound to happen.

1084
01:57:05,254 --> 01:57:07,848
Give him a little kiss from me, okay?

1085
01:57:08,057 --> 01:57:11,515
I always get "Kimsala" and "Kimsal"
mixed up.

1086
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:13,287
It's Timsal.

1087
01:57:13,429 --> 01:57:15,397
I always get it wrong.

1088
01:57:15,531 --> 01:57:17,658
I say it every morning.

1089
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:19,700
It's crazy!

1090
01:57:19,835 --> 01:57:22,201
Did he say it was serious?

1091
01:57:22,404 --> 01:57:24,736
It happens to cats when they're nine.

1092
01:57:24,873 --> 01:57:27,865
I know. Just give him
a little kiss for me.

1093
01:57:28,010 --> 01:57:30,342
Another coffee, please.

1094
01:57:30,479 --> 01:57:32,538
-It's been ages.
-I'll give him a hug.

1095
01:57:32,681 --> 01:57:34,581
Even if it's a cat, we don't care.

1096
01:57:34,717 --> 01:57:37,481
I promise I'll give him a cuddle.

1097
01:57:37,620 --> 01:57:41,283
-He'll be happy.
-I'm going over there.

1098
01:57:41,423 --> 01:57:44,950
Don't forget your knife.

1099
01:57:48,030 --> 01:57:49,588
Thank you.

1100
01:57:58,741 --> 01:58:01,005
-Hello.
-Hi, Philippe. How are you?

1101
01:58:01,977 --> 01:58:04,036
Arie Neumann?

1102
01:58:04,179 --> 01:58:06,044
Yes, that's me.

1103
01:58:07,182 --> 01:58:09,412
You wrote to me.

1104
01:58:10,786 --> 01:58:12,276
Sit down.

1105
01:58:16,191 --> 01:58:19,592
It's cowardly to send letters
without signing them.

1106
01:58:20,596 --> 01:58:22,496
Why did you come to see me?

1107
01:58:22,631 --> 01:58:25,759
Your last letter
was particularly insulting.

1108
01:58:25,901 --> 01:58:27,562
You could have ignored it.

1109
01:58:27,703 --> 01:58:31,503
You could have just burned it.

1110
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:33,699
Maybe.

1111
01:58:33,842 --> 01:58:37,005
But I wanted to see your face.

1112
01:58:37,212 --> 01:58:40,113
Each one of these texts is signed,

1113
01:58:40,249 --> 01:58:44,652
with a name or by the system
that produced them.

1114
01:58:48,824 --> 01:58:52,157
It's perverse to hide like this.

1115
01:58:52,294 --> 01:58:54,125
It's not human.

1116
01:58:54,330 --> 01:58:55,888
You're right.

1117
01:58:57,266 --> 01:59:02,294
Those are the exact words:
"not human."

1118
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:06,601
A gratuitous play on Jüst's name.

1119
01:59:06,742 --> 01:59:12,180
A play on a name,
one word for another.

1120
01:59:12,381 --> 01:59:14,144
A resemblance.

1121
01:59:14,283 --> 01:59:17,377
It's so common these days.

1122
01:59:17,519 --> 01:59:23,287
Language is a powerful means
of propaganda.

1123
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:27,896
It's the most public
and the most secret

1124
01:59:28,030 --> 01:59:30,055
at the same time.

1125
01:59:30,199 --> 01:59:32,133
The effect of this propaganda

1126
01:59:32,267 --> 01:59:40,538
isn't produced by speeches,
articles, and flyers.

1127
01:59:40,676 --> 01:59:46,046
It seeps into the masses'
flesh and blood.

1128
01:59:46,181 --> 01:59:51,175
Did you know we don't have
poor people anymore?

1129
01:59:51,320 --> 01:59:53,948
Only people on modest incomes.

1130
01:59:54,156 --> 02:00:03,087
We no longer talk of "issues"
such as "social issues",

1131
02:00:03,232 --> 02:00:06,861
but "problems" that our specialists

1132
02:00:07,035 --> 02:00:12,098
split up into a series
of technical details.

1133
02:00:13,409 --> 02:00:19,143
For each one,
they'll find the optimum solution.

1134
02:00:20,315 --> 02:00:22,112
Efficient methods.

1135
02:00:22,251 --> 02:00:23,650
But....

1136
02:00:23,852 --> 02:00:28,312
But words emptied of all meaning.

1137
02:00:29,057 --> 02:00:32,857
It's a break down of the language.

1138
02:00:33,061 --> 02:00:36,360
A dead language.

1139
02:00:36,498 --> 02:00:38,625
Neutral.

1140
02:00:40,035 --> 02:00:43,129
Invaded by technical words.

1141
02:00:45,407 --> 02:00:51,937
A language which gradually
absorbs its humanity.

1142
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:54,139
Understand?

1143
02:00:56,485 --> 02:01:00,182
I see a gray truck crossing the city.

1144
02:01:01,190 --> 02:01:05,354
It's an ordinary steel panel truck

1145
02:01:05,494 --> 02:01:09,863
heading towards the mines,

1146
02:01:10,999 --> 02:01:15,561
two or three kilometers
from the last houses.

1147
02:01:16,138 --> 02:01:20,006
Neither the driver
nor the escorting officer

1148
02:01:20,142 --> 02:01:23,942
look back through the observation
window into the truck.

1149
02:01:24,079 --> 02:01:25,910
They're tired.

1150
02:01:26,048 --> 02:01:32,886
They've still got 10 transports
before night falls.

1151
02:01:33,088 --> 02:01:40,392
10 journeys across town
in difficult conditions.

1152
02:01:40,529 --> 02:01:42,861
All the more difficult

1153
02:01:42,998 --> 02:01:49,096
because in the first few minutes
of the transport,

1154
02:01:49,238 --> 02:01:53,971
they have to run the engine
at full throttle

1155
02:01:54,109 --> 02:01:59,672
to drown out the screams
and the strange lurches and jolts

1156
02:01:59,815 --> 02:02:03,307
that almost make the truck
topple over.

1157
02:02:03,986 --> 02:02:07,251
Fortunately,
things soon go quiet again,

1158
02:02:07,389 --> 02:02:12,156
and the transport
is always completed on time,

1159
02:02:12,294 --> 02:02:14,592
in keeping with the schedule.

1160
02:02:16,098 --> 02:02:18,464
"Where do the trucks go?",

1161
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:22,593
asks the child
standing at the window.

1162
02:02:22,738 --> 02:02:25,502
At nightfall,

1163
02:02:25,641 --> 02:02:30,772
the child sees the vehicles
lined up in the schoolyard.

1164
02:02:30,913 --> 02:02:37,910
He sees the drivers handing around
a bottle of Schnapps.

1165
02:02:38,053 --> 02:02:43,650
The men are exhausted,
happy to end a day

1166
02:02:43,792 --> 02:02:51,130
which began, like the others,
much too early.

1167
02:02:52,601 --> 02:02:59,769
The escorts finish off
writing up their figures

1168
02:02:59,908 --> 02:03:06,143
and hand in their daily reports.

1169
02:03:08,517 --> 02:03:13,978
The child sees his father,

1170
02:03:16,191 --> 02:03:17,624
the officer-foreman,

1171
02:03:17,759 --> 02:03:21,490
slap each man on the back,

1172
02:03:21,697 --> 02:03:24,928
and joke with each in turn.

1173
02:03:27,769 --> 02:03:33,571
The officer thinks
that if the weather's fine

1174
02:03:34,943 --> 02:03:38,743
and there's no rain
to bog down the trucks,

1175
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:43,078
he might be able
to finish his mission

1176
02:03:43,218 --> 02:03:45,618
by the end of the week.

1177
02:03:45,754 --> 02:03:49,850
And his superior,
the Obersturmbannfürher

1178
02:03:50,726 --> 02:03:57,359
who issued the order
from a place 100 kilometers away,

1179
02:03:57,499 --> 02:03:59,296
will congratulate him

1180
02:03:59,434 --> 02:04:03,302
on the smooth-running
of the operation.

1181
02:04:03,438 --> 02:04:11,209
If you were to ask each man
what he was doing,

1182
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:15,181
he would reply,

1183
02:04:15,317 --> 02:04:17,877
"Everything's going as planned,

1184
02:04:19,955 --> 02:04:25,860
although it's possible
we're a little behind schedule."

1185
02:04:28,363 --> 02:04:35,701
He'd answer using
that same dead, neutral,

1186
02:04:35,837 --> 02:04:38,067
technical language,

1187
02:04:39,374 --> 02:04:44,937
which makes him a truck driver,

1188
02:04:45,080 --> 02:04:48,743
an escorting officer,
an Unterführer,

1189
02:04:48,884 --> 02:04:55,050
a foreman, a scientist,
a technical director,

1190
02:04:55,190 --> 02:04:58,956
an Obersturmbannführer.

1191
02:05:06,234 --> 02:05:09,362
Were you the child at the window?

1192
02:05:23,485 --> 02:05:29,219
The child at the window was
Officer-Foreman Neumann's son.

1193
02:05:29,357 --> 02:05:31,757
He didn't want to tell me
his first name,

1194
02:05:31,893 --> 02:05:35,522
but I know "Arie" wasn't the one
his father gave him.

1195
02:07:06,521 --> 02:07:09,922
The musicians took their places

1196
02:07:10,058 --> 02:07:14,495
and I saw the scene from my dream.

1197
02:07:14,696 --> 02:07:19,861
Arie Neumann came in last,
holding his violin.

1198
02:07:20,769 --> 02:07:24,933
He remained standing,
looking directly at me.

1199
02:07:29,411 --> 02:07:35,043
I saw a man go towards the door
but I didn't shout for him to stop.

1200
02:07:36,117 --> 02:07:41,111
I saw the black mass
of tangled bodies.

1201
02:07:41,256 --> 02:07:43,087
Merchandise.

1202
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:49,494
Cargo.

1203
02:07:51,433 --> 02:07:56,132
I saw a world of nakedness

1204
02:07:56,271 --> 02:07:59,729
under the yellowish,
caged-in light,

1205
02:07:59,875 --> 02:08:03,902
which slid down
a lightly sloping floor,

1206
02:08:04,045 --> 02:08:08,482
exposing a hand, a leg,

1207
02:08:08,617 --> 02:08:11,211
a crushed face,

1208
02:08:12,821 --> 02:08:15,312
a twisted mouth,

1209
02:08:15,457 --> 02:08:17,891
bleeding.

1210
02:08:18,526 --> 02:08:22,121
Fingers clutching
a dirty undergarment

1211
02:08:22,264 --> 02:08:31,866
stained with urine, vomit,
blood, sweat, drool.

1212
02:08:33,208 --> 02:08:35,335
Liquid.

1213
02:08:38,613 --> 02:08:41,309
Here was part of a back,

1214
02:08:41,449 --> 02:08:45,408
the head and arms
buried under other bodies.

1215
02:08:46,254 --> 02:08:50,850
There, a body entwined
around another.

1216
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:55,090
And all these bodies....

1217
02:08:55,230 --> 02:08:56,822
Pieces.

1218
02:08:56,965 --> 02:08:59,160
Rolling over one another,

1219
02:08:59,301 --> 02:09:02,293
shifting the weight of the mass
towards the pit.

1220
02:09:02,437 --> 02:09:09,206
All these corpses, tangled up,
still muddled together,

1221
02:09:09,344 --> 02:09:14,247
but slowly separating from the mass
with the shifting weight.

1222
02:09:14,382 --> 02:09:16,850
Shifting weight.

1223
02:09:16,985 --> 02:09:21,388
Each one gradually pulling out
of the suffocating human embrace.

1224
02:09:21,523 --> 02:09:27,860
A grimacing face, turned blue,
stuporous.

1225
02:09:27,996 --> 02:09:30,123
And beneath....

1226
02:09:30,765 --> 02:09:33,256
The shit.

1227
02:09:33,401 --> 02:09:37,303
Little children cradled
in women's legs.

1228
02:09:37,439 --> 02:09:42,706
Scrawny old men,
little girls with sunken eyes,

1229
02:09:43,545 --> 02:09:47,743
naked boys covered in bruises.

1230
02:09:47,882 --> 02:09:50,282
All these creatures....

1231
02:09:50,418 --> 02:09:52,079
Pieces,

1232
02:09:52,220 --> 02:09:54,017
who had names.

1233
02:09:54,155 --> 02:09:56,214
Pieces.

1234
02:09:57,125 --> 02:09:58,092
Moïse.

1235
02:09:58,226 --> 02:09:59,750
Moshe.

1236
02:10:00,261 --> 02:10:02,126
My brother.

1237
02:10:02,864 --> 02:10:04,559
Robert.

1238
02:10:05,333 --> 02:10:07,233
My father.

1239
02:10:08,536 --> 02:10:10,128
Armand.

1240
02:10:10,905 --> 02:10:12,372
Miguel.

1241
02:10:14,576 --> 02:10:16,441
Amos.

1242
02:10:18,079 --> 02:10:20,070
Hannah.

1243
02:10:20,949 --> 02:10:22,849
Samuel.

1244
02:10:24,085 --> 02:10:26,212
Pieces.

1245
02:10:27,222 --> 02:10:28,849
My mother.

1246
02:10:30,425 --> 02:10:32,518
My love.

1247
02:10:33,828 --> 02:10:35,887
Pieces.

1248
02:10:36,464 --> 02:10:38,261
My sister.

1249
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:39,492
Simone.

1250
02:10:39,634 --> 02:10:41,795
Magdalena.

1251
02:10:42,537 --> 02:10:47,770
Each of these bodies gradually
emerging from this vast naked sea

1252
02:10:47,909 --> 02:10:52,278
to fall one after the other,
in pairs, in bundles,

1253
02:10:52,414 --> 02:10:55,008
into the dark hole of the mine.

1254
02:10:55,150 --> 02:10:56,913
Darkness.

1255
02:10:57,052 --> 02:11:00,715
A sea of bodies, buried,
swallowed up.
