00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,881
- Clamp.
- Clamp. Sorry, Doctor.

00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:09,949
# For you, dear ##

8
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:12,086
You seem preoccupied, Donovan.
Is anything wrong?

9
00:01:12,163 --> 00:01:16,122
- No, nothing. Thank you.
- If it's me, I can always
move to another war. Clamp.

10
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,135
Will you pipe down, Pierce!
We're working over here.

11
00:01:19,268 --> 00:01:21,168
What do you think we're doing
over here, playing hearts?

12
00:01:21,237 --> 00:01:23,398
You're always looking
for a fight.

13
00:01:23,473 --> 00:01:25,703
I've certainly come
to the right place. Suture.

14
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:27,868
I don't mind singing
in the O.R.

15
00:01:27,944 --> 00:01:30,242
I'm liable to bust out
myself any minute.

16
00:01:30,313 --> 00:01:32,781
Oh, go right ahead, Colonel.
It'll do your old heart...

17
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:35,374
middle-aged heart good, sir.
[Chuckling]

18
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:38,045
You certainly have
a winning way, Junior.

19
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:41,090
- Colonel, I wonder if you could
help me with a problem.
- Well, I hope so.

20
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:44,217
I haven't received a letter
from my fiance in four days.

21
00:01:44,293 --> 00:01:48,423
- You want me to write you one?
- Not much I can do, Major.
Maybe Penobscott's busy.

22
00:01:48,498 --> 00:01:53,834
- Yeah. Learning to write.
- I'll ignore that
jealousy-inspired wisecrack.

23
00:01:53,903 --> 00:01:57,669
- Has anybody been getting mail?
- Suture. I've been getting
fan mail from North Korea.

24
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,731
They want me to play
Panmunjom after the war.

25
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:02,107
Peace talks are playing there now.
It's a tough act to follow.

26
00:02:02,178 --> 00:02:05,705
I got mail. I got a wonderful letter
from my old Sunday school teacher.

27
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:08,012
Tell us about it,
and I'll step on your foot.

28
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:11,019
I'm worried about Donald.
He works so hard.

29
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:13,988
- Maybe he strained himself thinking.
- Don't you wish.

30
00:02:14,056 --> 00:02:16,115
He has a mind
like a steel trap.

31
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:20,686
That could be dangerous. If he gets an idea,
he'll snap his neck and swallow his face.

32
00:02:20,763 --> 00:02:23,231
I feel like Rip Van Winkle.
How long have we been in there?

33
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:25,392
<i>[Donovan]</i>
<i>Seven and a halfhours.</i>

34
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:27,766
If I weren't certain
of being knighted, I'd resign.

35
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:29,998
- I wasn't much help to you doctors.
- You were fine.

36
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:32,063
I'm afraid I've got
too many things on my mind.

37
00:02:32,141 --> 00:02:34,666
We all do. I can't decide on
who to ask to the movies tonight.

38
00:02:34,744 --> 00:02:36,905
- I'll bet it isn't me.
- Don't be so sure.

39
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:39,846
- Well, how about you?
- You're asking me after him?

40
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:42,817
Well, he turned me down. I'm on the
rebound now. This is your big chance.

41
00:02:42,885 --> 00:02:45,752
- I don't play second fiddle.
- Forget the fiddle. What do you play?

42
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:48,791
- Solitaire.
- Come on. What do you say?

43
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:52,294
Dinner in the Mess Tent...
the room that floats in fat.

44
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:55,524
Followed by a rotten motion picture.
It's a perfect evening.

45
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,533
- I'm busy.
- Going to the auto show?

46
00:02:58,601 --> 00:03:01,195
Post-op. I'm helping B.J.
Follow up on some cases.

47
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,261
You're doing time
with Hunnicutt?

48
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:05,773
- Who sentenced you to that?
- I volunteered.

49
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:09,141
You're turning down a chance to be seen
with the Porfirio Rubirosa of Ouijongbu.

50
00:03:09,212 --> 00:03:11,942
- What a tongue twister.
- Oh, you've heard about me.

51
00:03:12,014 --> 00:03:14,005
- Maybe next time, Captain.
- I'll have my florist send...

52
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:17,018
- an armful of pussy willows to your tent.
- It won't help.

53
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:19,577
How about a box
of dehydrated chocolates?

54
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:24,285
- Poor girl's gone bonkers.
- Who, Donovan?

55
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,988
Yeah. She turned down a chance to hold
hands with me in the flicks tonight.

56
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:30,362
Ah. Someday she'll look back
and wanna pound her head on a rock.

57
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:32,628
Is she actually
helping you out in post-op?

58
00:03:32,702 --> 00:03:34,693
Is that so crazy?

59
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,704
You two got the mutual
irresistables for each other?

60
00:03:36,772 --> 00:03:39,070
[Laughs]
Come on.

61
00:03:39,141 --> 00:03:42,167
Tell me, who's the most
devoted family man in the world?

62
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:44,236
Mickey Rooney.

63
00:03:44,313 --> 00:03:46,747
- Who gets an "A" in fidelity?
- R.C.A. Victor.

64
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,875
No. You, both times.

65
00:03:48,951 --> 00:03:50,942
So how come she turns down
a date with Dr. Jekyll...

66
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,421
- to go work in the lab with Mr. Hyde?
- She's helping me with cases.

67
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,481
I could use a little
of that kind of help myself.

68
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:59,050
Hawk, her husband's
back in the States...

69
00:03:59,128 --> 00:04:01,153
and, uh, their marriage
is in trouble.

70
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,165
Gee, I can't understand why.
They're only 12,000 miles apart.

71
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:06,497
She's really upset about it,
and work's good therapy.

72
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:10,505
- Are you sure there's nothing
going on between you two kids?
- Honest.

73
00:04:10,573 --> 00:04:13,565
- A little hanky-panky after taps?
- Scout's honor.

74
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:15,406
- Before? During?
- <i>No.</i>

75
00:04:15,478 --> 00:04:19,005
- I'm happily married.
- Oh, yeah?

76
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:21,072
I thought that was
a contradiction in terms.

77
00:04:23,252 --> 00:04:25,243
Colonel, how'd you like
a delicious cup of coffee?

78
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:27,983
- I'd love it.
- Me too. This stuff stinks.

79
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:32,084
- I just don't understand
why Donald hasn't written.
- Maybe there's another woman.

80
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:34,152
- Fat chance.
- Another man?

81
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,824
Donald is so devoted
it's scary.

82
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:38,924
I can certainly tell
when someone loves me.

83
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:40,992
When you kiss him,
he clicks his heels.

84
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,200
- I can feel his loving arms
all the way from Tokyo.
- Not bad for a stocky guy.

85
00:04:45,274 --> 00:04:48,766
Maybe he's involved in some of that spy stuff,
like parachuting into North Korea.

86
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:50,835
- That's possible.
- Is he qualified?

87
00:04:50,913 --> 00:04:53,541
- He's made 126 jumps.
- Once from a plane.

88
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:55,607
Mail call, Colonel.
You got a letter from Mrs. Colonel.

89
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:58,813
- Bless the dear girl.
- Captain Hunnicutt, you got
three from your wife.

90
00:04:58,888 --> 00:05:01,550
- You got three?
- Gotta write 'em to get 'em.

91
00:05:01,624 --> 00:05:04,422
Oh, I don't know. Melville wrote
Moby Dick, and he never wrote back.

92
00:05:04,493 --> 00:05:08,054
- Probably on a cruise.
- Major Houlihan, a letter
from your lieutenant colonel.

93
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,724
Oh! Wonderful.
Wait a minute!

94
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,361
- This letter has been opened. Look.
- Sometimes they come like that.

95
00:05:14,437 --> 00:05:17,270
And sometimes they're opened
by creepy company clerks...

96
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,968
who like to peek
at intimate personal passages.

97
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:22,067
- Come on, Margaret. That's uncalled for.
- It's not fair.

98
00:05:22,144 --> 00:05:24,135
Yeah, and it wasn't even
very intimate either.

99
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:27,307
- Nosy jerk.
- Come on, Margaret.
Smell your letter and read it.

100
00:05:40,062 --> 00:05:42,155
- Oh, this is terrible.
- What is it?

101
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:45,564
- Did peace break out?
- It's Donald. He's in Tokyo Army Hospital.

102
00:05:45,634 --> 00:05:48,797
- What's wrong with him?
- He doesn't say, brave darling.

103
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:52,329
- Could be just a checkup.
- Maybe he's having a neck installed.

104
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:54,069
Or getting
his upper lip starched.

105
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:57,772
You're just jealous
because Donald is full-lipped.

106
00:05:57,847 --> 00:06:00,338
- I'm getting excited.
- Eat your pudding.

107
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,290
- How you doing, Donovan?
- Okay.

108
00:06:14,363 --> 00:06:16,627
Obviously. Anything I can do?

109
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:20,032
- No.
- Bad news from home?

110
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:24,630
It's a letter from my old man...
a Dear Jane.

111
00:06:24,707 --> 00:06:28,336
<i>He started out with, uh,</i>
<i>"Dear Carrie...</i>

112
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:31,836
I just don't know how
to tell you this."

113
00:06:31,914 --> 00:06:34,610
But he found a way.

114
00:06:34,683 --> 00:06:37,652
Yeah, he did.

115
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:44,651
Listen, uh, why don't you skip
post-op tonight?

116
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:46,991
- No. I'll be there.
- You don't have to. I can handle it.

117
00:06:47,063 --> 00:06:49,054
So can I.

118
00:06:49,932 --> 00:06:52,628
- Okay.
- B.J.?

119
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:55,431
- Yeah?
- Thank you.

120
00:06:55,504 --> 00:06:57,495
Sure.

121
00:07:09,985 --> 00:07:12,818
You know, when you're hurting,
sometimes it helps to talk about it.

122
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:23,361
My wife bottles things up,
keeps everything inside.

123
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:26,899
So I get in her way
in the kitchen.

124
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:31,133
I keep nudging her till she gets
sore enough to swing at me.

125
00:07:31,207 --> 00:07:34,608
Then out it comes...
the anger, tears...

126
00:07:34,677 --> 00:07:37,510
<i>the problem</i>... <i>everything.</i>

127
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,549
- You must be a good husband.
- Yeah, but we miss a lot of dinners.

128
00:07:42,218 --> 00:07:44,448
[Chuckles]

129
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,547
- Would you like to talk about it?
- N-No. Thanks.

130
00:07:48,624 --> 00:07:50,649
Just like Peggy... stubborn.

131
00:07:50,726 --> 00:07:52,717
I'll meet you in the kitchen.

132
00:07:54,497 --> 00:07:58,365
- You can cork me two good ones.
- [Laughs]

133
00:07:58,434 --> 00:08:02,097
To be honest, I'd like to talk.

134
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:05,106
But not here. Someplace where
we wouldn't be interrupted.

135
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:09,702
- How about Guam?
- How about my tent?

136
00:08:09,778 --> 00:08:12,144
- Oh, that wouldn't do.
- <i>Why not?</i>

137
00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:14,580
It wouldn't look right.
People might get the wrong idea.

138
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,845
You wanna talk in your tent,
we'll talk in your tent.

139
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,910
After I'm finished here,
I'll stop by.

140
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:20,888
Thanks, B.J.

141
00:08:21,957 --> 00:08:24,050
No problem. Now beat it.

142
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:29,763
- [Snoring]
- Corporal! Corporal O'Reilly!

143
00:08:29,832 --> 00:08:31,823
- Betty!
- [Screams]

144
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:33,892
- What are you doing!
- What?

145
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:35,960
- What am I doing? I don't know.
- You kissed a superior officer!

146
00:08:36,038 --> 00:08:38,233
- I did? I didn't mean to.
- Why did you do that?

147
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:40,867
I don't know. I was sleeping,
and I was dreaming about...

148
00:08:40,943 --> 00:08:43,173
- It's personal!
- Don't you ever do that again!

149
00:08:43,245 --> 00:08:45,975
- I won't. Never!
- Hurry up. Get up. I want you
to make a call for me.

150
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:48,676
- Oh, okay.
- Get up. I want you to call Tokyo.

151
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:51,151
- Tokyo Army Hospital.
- Right. I got it.

152
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,381
I want to speak to Lieutenant
Colonel Donald Penobscott.

153
00:08:53,455 --> 00:08:56,356
- Yeah, I know.
He's your whatchamacallit.
- My fiance, Corporal!

154
00:08:56,425 --> 00:09:00,623
Right. Sparky? Yeah, Sparky, listen.
Get me Tokyo Army Hospital, quick.

155
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:04,427
And we won't ever mention to Lt. Col.
Penobscott about what just happened, will we?

156
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,936
- Oh, never, never, ever.
- 'Cause he's big and strong
and insanely jealous.

157
00:09:08,003 --> 00:09:11,131
- And he's got the bite of a bulldog.
- Who said that?

158
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:13,641
Nobody. I mean, l-I just
overheard it someplace.

159
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:16,906
- Are you working that thing?
- Yes, right! Hello, Operator!

160
00:09:16,979 --> 00:09:20,972
Yes. Ma'am, please, get me
Lt. Donald Col. Penobscott.

161
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,610
- A patient.
- A patient. And it's an emergency.

162
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:26,849
- What's going on in here?
Who are you calling, Radar?
- Oh, it's for me, Colonel.

163
00:09:26,922 --> 00:09:29,652
We're calling my fiance in Tokyo.
I've been worried sick.

164
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:31,955
What? What, Operator?

165
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:35,554
- But... Ma'am, he's not accepting any calls.
- What?

166
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:38,532
- [Gasps] Leave a message.
- A message, Operator.

167
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:40,831
- Tell him to call Maj. Margaret Houlihan.
- Call Maj. Margaret Houlihan.

168
00:09:40,903 --> 00:09:42,894
- MASH 4077.
- MASH 4077.

169
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:44,963
- Worried to death.
- Worried to death.

170
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,565
- Love and kisses.
- Love and kisses.

171
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:51,239
Aren't you in
a premature panic, Major?

172
00:09:51,313 --> 00:09:54,077
He's not taking any calls.
This could be very serious.

173
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:56,583
- <i>Maybe he's just resting.</i>
- Colonel, request permission to go to Tokyo...

174
00:09:56,652 --> 00:09:58,643
and attend my fiance
before he dies.

175
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:00,848
Why don't you relax,
find out what's wrong.

176
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:03,323
I'll take a chopper in the morning
to Kimpo and hitch a ride to Tokyo.

177
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:05,519
No, Major. Let's be patient
for another day.

178
00:10:05,594 --> 00:10:07,619
I'm not tying up a chopper
and losing a nurse...

179
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:10,688
just to find out Penobscott
has a simple pimple on his butt.

180
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:12,996
"A simple pimple
on his butt"?

181
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:15,730
Radar, where'd you
get that lipstick?

182
00:10:15,804 --> 00:10:18,602
Maj. Houlihan.
It was an accident!

183
00:10:18,674 --> 00:10:21,575
- I told you to keep your mouth shut!
- Right. She did.

184
00:10:21,644 --> 00:10:24,078
- It was an accident.
- Of course.

185
00:10:25,748 --> 00:10:27,739
- Good night.
- Good night, Major.

186
00:10:27,816 --> 00:10:32,253
[Clears Throat]
Why don't you get some rest, Romeo?

187
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:41,852
I thought I had a good marriage.

188
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:45,056
The war killed it.

189
00:10:47,503 --> 00:10:50,404
"I wish you were writing
this letter instead of me.

190
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:52,463
"It'd be so much easier.

191
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:57,168
"I know I'll always love you.

192
00:10:59,315 --> 00:11:02,250
- But I met someone..."
- Carrie.

193
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:05,410
I'm gonna make a little prediction.

194
00:11:05,487 --> 00:11:09,080
One fine day, believe it
or not, you'll get over all this.

195
00:11:09,213 --> 00:11:11,909
The hurt will pass.

196
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:14,008
You'll forgive him, and you'll
be ready to love again.

197
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:17,145
- It seems impossible.
- I know.

198
00:11:17,221 --> 00:11:20,418
I know, but someday you'll be glad
that guy's outta your hair.

199
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:23,221
- A new fella will come along.
- [Chuckles]

200
00:11:23,294 --> 00:11:25,785
Nice, bright guy...
a sucker for eyes like yours.

201
00:11:25,863 --> 00:11:28,354
- [Sniffles]
- And you'll start dating.

202
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:30,424
He'll fall madly
in love with you.

203
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:33,163
And you'll turn around
and clobber the poor slob.

204
00:11:33,237 --> 00:11:35,228
[Sighs]

205
00:11:48,653 --> 00:11:52,282
- [Yawns]
- You want me to wake you up
when you're finished eating?

206
00:11:52,356 --> 00:11:55,052
I didn't get any sleep
last night.

207
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:59,688
Gee, I dreamt I was dancing with Major
Houlihan, and Betty Grable woke me up.

208
00:11:59,764 --> 00:12:01,755
Somethin' like that.

209
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:06,332
- Morning.
- Morning.

210
00:12:06,404 --> 00:12:09,100
- You were out awful late last night.
- Lots to do in post-op.

211
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:11,971
- You were gone when I woke up this morning.
- Couldn't sleep.

212
00:12:12,043 --> 00:12:14,568
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were out all night.

213
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:16,977
- Mm-hmm.
- You could've called.

214
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:21,007
- Mother and I were worried sick.
- Dad? Shut up.

215
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:23,076
Ah, I hate to see them grow up.

216
00:12:23,154 --> 00:12:25,145
I just hope you weren't wasting
your time with some nurse.

217
00:12:25,223 --> 00:12:27,214
Let's say I was sitting up
with a sick friend.

218
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,816
Good. Start at the beginning
and tell me all about it.

219
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:31,885
- Good morning.
- Morning.

220
00:12:31,963 --> 00:12:34,989
Donovan, you look like a new woman, not that
there was anything wrong with the old one.

221
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:37,933
- Thanks. I feel better.
- Well, why shouldn't we all feel good?

222
00:12:38,002 --> 00:12:42,063
Our work is so rewarding... always lending
a helping hand, doing unto others.

223
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,971
Hawk? Your mouth runneth over.

224
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,703
I'm just teasing. I mean,
do I know what I'm saying?

225
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:48,803
Whatever it is,
I don't mean it. Should I go?

226
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,644
- Just stop talking.
- I will as soon as I get
my foot out of my mouth.

227
00:12:51,716 --> 00:12:54,776
I think I'll put it someplace else.
Ah, I'm being paged at the pool.

228
00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:57,616
Well, you two carry on.
[Laughs] Strike that.

229
00:12:57,688 --> 00:12:59,679
This is me leaving.
Here I go.

230
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:01,748
Bye. So long.

231
00:13:06,964 --> 00:13:08,955
- Hello?
- Hi.

232
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:11,866
Anybody in there?

233
00:13:11,936 --> 00:13:14,700
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm
a little, uh, preoccupied.

234
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:18,208
- Anything wrong?
- Oh, no. No.

235
00:13:19,844 --> 00:13:22,039
I, uh... I see
you're trying the eggs.

236
00:13:22,113 --> 00:13:24,104
You're braver than I am.

237
00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:28,608
Will you excuse me, Carrie?
I've got a lot of work to do.

238
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:36,820
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- One second, please.

239
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,621
- Major Houlihan.
- Major Burns.

240
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:44,133
- Am I disturbing you?
- Not yet.

241
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:46,193
Now you are.
What is it?

242
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:50,138
Firstly, may I say I'm sincerely
unhappy your fiance is terribly sick.

243
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,177
He's not terribly sick.
All I know is that he's in the hospital.

244
00:13:53,244 --> 00:13:55,235
Oh, when they don't tell you,
it's usually pretty bad.

245
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:58,510
They haven't <i>not</i> told me.
I just haven't been able to find out.

246
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:01,882
And I'm sincerely not happy
you're unhappy.

247
00:14:01,953 --> 00:14:05,320
Thank you, Frank.
Anything else?

248
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:09,416
Oh, yes. Uh, I have this little gift
to present to you.

249
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:12,257
- Oh.
- It's just a little inexpensive
token of sincerity.

250
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,060
How lovely.
A Japanese umbrella.

251
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:17,623
- Made in Texas.
- Thank you, Frank.

252
00:14:17,702 --> 00:14:20,466
- That was very sweet.
- Well, giving is what it's all about.

253
00:14:20,538 --> 00:14:22,529
We had a fine relationship
once, Margaret...

254
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:24,768
and this just goes to prove
that there's no hard feelings.

255
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:29,404
Oh, I get cranky at times, but...
we're still pals, okay?

256
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,244
- What a nice speech.
- It's off-the-cuff.

257
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:36,013
Thank you, Frank.
I hope we can always be friends.

258
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:38,078
Oh, why not?
I'm always ready if you need me.

259
00:14:38,155 --> 00:14:41,352
I appreciate that, and I'm really
anxious for you to meet Donald.

260
00:14:41,425 --> 00:14:43,518
I think about you in here
and me just across the compound.

261
00:14:43,594 --> 00:14:47,086
- I think about the good times
we had. I'll never forget 'em.
- Neither will I, Frank.

262
00:14:47,164 --> 00:14:50,463
- A lot of people knock this war,
but I can't. It gave me you.
- Oh, thank you.

263
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:54,561
Our friendship is real. It's warm.
It's honest. It's... convenient.

264
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,006
- Frank!
- I'm doing my best, Margaret!

265
00:14:58,075 --> 00:15:00,703
- But it's not enough.
I can't stand it anymore.
- Frank, stop it!

266
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:02,973
- Hold on to yourself!
- Not me! You!

267
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:06,312
- Let go of me! You fake! You fake!
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

268
00:15:06,384 --> 00:15:09,046
- Don't break it! I can get my money back!
- You pretend you're my friend!

269
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,554
Take it home,
you phony baloney!

270
00:15:13,391 --> 00:15:15,825
[Whimpering]
Oh, Donald.

271
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:23,423
- How do you feel?
- Terrible.

272
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:26,334
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

273
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:28,395
Nothing like an old fink
to tell your troubles to.

274
00:15:28,472 --> 00:15:30,804
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Come on.

275
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,639
Pour your heart out.
I'm a doctor. I can fix it.

276
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:36,077
[Sighs]

277
00:15:36,147 --> 00:15:39,878
Hawk, you're looking at a guy
that fell off the fidelity wagon.

278
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:42,112
I thought I heard a thump
sometime last night.

279
00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:44,586
And I'm miserable.

280
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:47,522
I'm a happily married man.
Not like Frank Burns is happy...

281
00:15:47,591 --> 00:15:50,424
because his wife
owns real estate.

282
00:15:50,494 --> 00:15:53,861
I adore my wife
and my kid and my marriage.

283
00:15:53,931 --> 00:15:55,762
I know.

284
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,165
I don't like being unfaithful.
I'm not lookin' around.

285
00:15:58,235 --> 00:16:02,433
- I'm lucky to have what I've got.
- You're right. You are lucky.

286
00:16:02,506 --> 00:16:04,497
God help me.

287
00:16:04,575 --> 00:16:07,066
B.J., you stumbled last night.
That's all.

288
00:16:07,144 --> 00:16:09,135
You were helping somebody,
and it got out of hand.

289
00:16:09,213 --> 00:16:11,204
- You made a mistake.
- I sure did.

290
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:17,149
- What's that?
- I'm writing Peg about it.

291
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:20,384
Wrong, wrong, wrong!
Don't be an idiot.

292
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:24,121
You made one lousy goof, and you wanna
punish yourself, but don't punish her.

293
00:16:24,195 --> 00:16:28,461
Do not tell Peg. Don't tell anybody
what you just told me.

294
00:16:28,532 --> 00:16:31,433
- This will pass.
- Like a kidney stone.

295
00:16:31,502 --> 00:16:34,630
Simply take a vow.
Raise your right hand.

296
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:36,696
Come on. Come on.

297
00:16:36,774 --> 00:16:40,471
I promise to be a good and faithful husband,
to write nice, cheerful letters home...

298
00:16:40,544 --> 00:16:43,138
to think of Peg often, and to keep
my fat hands off Nurse Donovan.

299
00:16:43,214 --> 00:16:45,375
Do you vow?

300
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:47,508
- I vow.
- I feel better about you already.

301
00:16:47,585 --> 00:16:49,576
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

302
00:16:49,653 --> 00:16:52,144
There's probably a career for me
in saving marriages.

303
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,623
You know, I'm gonna
take a vow too.

304
00:16:54,692 --> 00:16:57,661
- Good for you.
- I, Hawkeye Pierce, vow...

305
00:16:57,728 --> 00:17:00,526
that someday I will take a vow
just like his. Amen.

306
00:17:00,598 --> 00:17:03,795
But right now, I'm a little late
for a very important date.

307
00:17:03,868 --> 00:17:07,065
No time to say hello, good-bye.
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.

308
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,103
Lieutenant,
what can I do you for?

309
00:17:11,175 --> 00:17:13,871
Oh, uh, it's a personal problem,
Colonel.

310
00:17:13,944 --> 00:17:19,109
- Uh, my husband wants a divorce.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

311
00:17:19,183 --> 00:17:21,174
- Stateside, is he?
- Yes, Colonel.

312
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,051
Well, it's a wonder we don't have
more of this kind of casualty.

313
00:17:26,123 --> 00:17:28,523
They say absence makes
the heart grow fonder...

314
00:17:28,592 --> 00:17:30,651
but I think that's a lot
of buffalo bagels.

315
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:32,719
Excuse me.

316
00:17:32,797 --> 00:17:34,788
Sit down, Donovan.

317
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:40,235
Um, I'd like a transfer, Colonel.

318
00:17:40,304 --> 00:17:42,795
I'm making a mess of things
here at 4077.

319
00:17:42,873 --> 00:17:46,639
You volunteered for this duty, Lieutenant,
and you've been doing good work.

320
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,111
- We need you.
- I'd be happier elsewhere.

321
00:17:50,181 --> 00:17:54,117
<i>If you've got problems</i>...<i>people problems</i>...
<i>I'd like you to work them out.</i>

322
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:56,949
They don't mean anything compared
to what these boys are going through.

323
00:17:57,021 --> 00:18:00,252
- Don't you agree?
- Yes, Colonel.

324
00:18:00,324 --> 00:18:03,760
I don't want you leaving 'cause
you're hitting a rough stretch of road.

325
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:07,889
Hang on for a while. It's my opinion
you can ride it out. Okay?

326
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:12,899
- I'll try.
- <i>Thank you, Lieutenant.</i>

327
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,368
- Colonel Potter, sir.
- What do you want, Klinger?

328
00:18:19,443 --> 00:18:21,741
- Justice, sir.
- Justice in the army?

329
00:18:21,812 --> 00:18:24,781
- You're crazy.
- You might say that, Colonel.

330
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:27,784
Uh-oh. I don't like
those moist eyes.

331
00:18:27,852 --> 00:18:31,015
Sir, you ever heard of
the Toledo Strangler?

332
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:33,147
No.

333
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:36,057
He's struck eight times.
The terror of Toledo.

334
00:18:36,127 --> 00:18:39,824
- Kills only women motorcycle cops.
- So?

335
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:42,627
The fiend stands before you.

336
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,897
- You are the Toledo Strangler?
- I confess I am.

337
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,235
Extradite me. Send me back
to Toledo for a lengthy jury trial.

338
00:18:49,306 --> 00:18:52,139
- Why do you do this, Klinger?
- The sirens, sir.

339
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:55,372
The sirens on the motorcycles
drive me bananas.

340
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:57,880
- Have you read this?
- What do you mean?

341
00:18:57,948 --> 00:19:01,384
It says here the last murder
took place only two weeks ago.

342
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,587
This man's an imposter...
some nut trying to get in on my act.

343
00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:08,648
Beat it, Klinger.

344
00:19:08,726 --> 00:19:11,354
- But, sir, what about the newspaper clipping?
- What about it?

345
00:19:11,428 --> 00:19:13,760
It says the killer's from Toledo...

346
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:16,925
and always uses a yellow scarf.

347
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:19,128
- I rest my case.
- Paste it in your scrapbook.

348
00:19:19,203 --> 00:19:21,763
I could strangle somebody for you.
I don't mind auditioning.

349
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,865
- A person of your choice?
- Some other time.

350
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:27,638
Colonel, I don't expect you
to buy everything I bring in here...

351
00:19:27,711 --> 00:19:29,702
but maybe just once, okay?

352
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,716
Out, Klinger, before I call
a woman motorcycle cop.

353
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:35,775
[Clicks Heels]

354
00:19:40,257 --> 00:19:42,691
- Doctor? Captain Hunnicutt.
- What's wrong?

355
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,695
This one looks shocky.
He's waxy, and his lips are blue.

356
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:49,631
- What are his vital signs?
- Pulse 120. B.P. 94 over 52.

357
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,191
- Give me another unit of plasma.
- Right.

358
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:54,260
Nurse.

359
00:19:57,908 --> 00:19:59,899
Yeah. Thanks.

360
00:20:02,146 --> 00:20:04,706
- It was a good pickup, Carrie. Alert as hell.
- Thanks.

361
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:09,818
We're gonna have to
watch him for a while.

362
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:13,050
- How are you feeling?
- Why do you ask?

363
00:20:13,123 --> 00:20:15,489
- What?
- What do you care?

364
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:18,357
Those are the first civil words
you've spoken to me in a week.

365
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:21,193
- You're exaggerating a bit, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

366
00:20:21,265 --> 00:20:25,065
You've been salty as hell,
a bear with hangnails.

367
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:27,569
- I wasn't aware of it.
- Wanna talk about it?

368
00:20:27,638 --> 00:20:30,129
- No.
- <i>Why not?</i>

369
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:32,198
'Cause the last time
we talked, we didn't.

370
00:20:32,276 --> 00:20:34,267
That's what
we ought to talk about.

371
00:20:34,345 --> 00:20:37,143
B.J., it's important to me.

372
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,277
Okay.

373
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:43,912
Nurse.

374
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:46,684
Keep an eye on him for a few minutes.
I'll be right outside.

375
00:20:50,961 --> 00:20:53,953
[Wind Blowing]

376
00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:01,261
I know how you feel.

377
00:21:01,338 --> 00:21:04,353
You feel guilty,
but you're blaming me.

378
00:21:04,486 --> 00:21:06,511
No, I'm not.
I'm blaming myself.

379
00:21:06,588 --> 00:21:10,115
Only partly. I get your anger
every time I come near you.

380
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:12,183
I don't need it.

381
00:21:12,261 --> 00:21:15,355
Carrie, I'm sorry.
But you know what happened.

382
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:17,831
I got this enormous attack
of the guilts.

383
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,267
<i>I've never done that before.</i>

384
00:21:21,337 --> 00:21:25,603
I'm hopelessly, passionately
in love with my wife.

385
00:21:25,674 --> 00:21:30,771
- What's wrong with that?
- I don't want to mess that up.
I feel like I've betrayed her.

386
00:21:30,846 --> 00:21:35,545
Why? Because you were kind
and considerate and sweet to me?

387
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:38,745
<i>Because I was in despair one night,</i>
<i>and you helped me through it?</i>

388
00:21:38,821 --> 00:21:41,085
Are you ashamed of it?

389
00:21:41,156 --> 00:21:43,590
No, of course not, but there
was more to it than that.

390
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:45,957
We didn't plan that.

391
00:21:46,028 --> 00:21:49,464
We're still human beings, you know,
no matter how hard we try not to be.

392
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:52,762
Yes, I know,
and I'm still afraid.

393
00:21:52,835 --> 00:21:56,362
- Of what?
- Of you.

394
00:21:57,673 --> 00:22:00,039
Because you're right here...

395
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:02,703
and you're so attractive
and so close.

396
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:06,908
- And so vulnerable.
- Yes.

397
00:22:06,982 --> 00:22:10,474
- You don't trust yourself.
- [Scoffs]

398
00:22:10,552 --> 00:22:13,214
<i>B.J., just because</i>
<i>I'm across the compound...</i>

399
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:16,621
doesn't mean you can waltz
into my tent whenever you want to.

400
00:22:16,692 --> 00:22:20,128
<i>I needed you that night,</i>
<i>and you were there.</i>

401
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:23,287
I'll always love you for that.

402
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:26,960
It doesn't mean
it's ever gonna happen again.

403
00:22:27,036 --> 00:22:30,164
I can work out
my own problem.

404
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:32,469
I don't expect you
to be the answer to it.

405
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,940
[Sighs]
Does that make it easier?

406
00:22:40,716 --> 00:22:44,117
Yes... and no.

407
00:22:44,186 --> 00:22:46,120
We can be friends.

408
00:22:48,357 --> 00:22:50,882
Yes, we can.

409
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:52,950
Closer than most.
[Chuckles]

410
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:57,055
Still friends.

411
00:22:57,132 --> 00:22:59,032
Carrie...

412
00:22:59,101 --> 00:23:01,092
you're very special.

413
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,661
I like you too.

414
00:23:07,643 --> 00:23:11,841
Okay. Let's go back
to work, friend.

415
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:23,258
Hello! Hello!

416
00:23:23,325 --> 00:23:26,419
Lt. Donald Col. Penobscott?
Yes. Maj. Houlihan calling.

417
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:28,486
- Thank heaven!
- Thank Radar.

418
00:23:28,564 --> 00:23:31,124
Donald? Margaret.
How are you?

419
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,567
Oh, darling, I've been worried sick.
I was just saying l...

420
00:23:34,636 --> 00:23:36,797
Colonel, Corporal, may I make
my call in private, please?

421
00:23:36,872 --> 00:23:39,033
- Certainly.
- Sure.

422
00:23:39,108 --> 00:23:41,633
Donald, how are you?
Darling, what's happened to you?

423
00:23:42,978 --> 00:23:45,173
Oh, no! No!

424
00:23:45,247 --> 00:23:47,238
Colonel, Corporal,
come back in here, please!

425
00:23:47,316 --> 00:23:49,307
- What is it, Major?
- It's Donald. He's hurt himself...

426
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:51,875
a hernia doing the rope climb
on the obstacle course.

427
00:23:51,954 --> 00:23:53,945
Donald, you're always
training so hard.

428
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:56,013
Colonel, request permission
to go to him, please.

429
00:23:56,091 --> 00:23:58,321
- We're very busy, Major.
- But he's had a hernia operation.

430
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:00,384
- We need you here.
- He won't let me go.

431
00:24:00,462 --> 00:24:02,521
- It's this stupid war.
- She's right. It's the war.

432
00:24:02,598 --> 00:24:04,725
Colonel, Corporal, may I complete
my call in private, please?

433
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,328
- He'll be out of action
for about four weeks, Major.
- Never mind!

434
00:24:09,404 --> 00:24:14,137
Donald, you've gotta be
more careful! The rope climb...

435
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:16,677
- A double hernia!
- <i>[Potter] Eight weeks.</i>

436
00:24:16,745 --> 00:24:20,511
Oh, Donald! Donald,
you can't do this to me.

437
00:24:20,582 --> 00:24:24,018
You have to be a little more considerate.
After all, you're an engaged person.
