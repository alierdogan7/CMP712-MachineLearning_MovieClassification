<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Go, go, go, go, go!</i>

00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:19,398
How many times have I told you?
Deliveries in the rear.

4
00:01:19,467 --> 00:01:22,595
We overran a North Korean aid station.
We got some of ours and some of theirs.

5
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:25,071
- They brought in Commies?
- This bus will pick up anybody.

6
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,131
I didn't come to Korea
to treat the enemy.

7
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,199
[B.J.] I'm sure they'll be glad
to hear that, Frank.

8
00:01:29,277 --> 00:01:33,338
- O.R. Stat. Prep him.
- Litter!

9
00:01:33,415 --> 00:01:36,578
Rest in peace.

10
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:39,381
Now, this one can wait.
Well, what do we got here?

11
00:01:39,454 --> 00:01:41,581
A wounded Commie officer, huh?

12
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:44,181
Please. Take a look
at that man across the way.

13
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:46,159
What, you giving me instructions?

14
00:01:46,227 --> 00:01:50,254
He has an intra-abdominal bleed.
Probably a ruptured spleen.

15
00:01:50,332 --> 00:01:52,527
Listen, wise guy,
I'm the doctor here.

16
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:54,933
He's delirious. Last week,
he thought he was a fire chief.

17
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:58,302
You wanna hear a hot one? This pinko
here is trying to teach me medicine.

18
00:01:58,373 --> 00:02:01,103
- Tell him he's wasting his time.
- You keep your trap shut, Commie!

19
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:03,906
- You're in enough trouble as it is.
- Please, Doctor!

20
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:07,676
That man has internal bleeding.
He needs surgery immediately.

21
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:09,740
- Radar!
- Sir.

22
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:11,809
Get this man into pre-op.
He's number one on the hit parade.

23
00:02:11,886 --> 00:02:14,013
- Right. Roy!
- For criminy sakes, why
do you listen to him...

24
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:16,080
when you won't listen
to one of your own kind?

25
00:02:16,157 --> 00:02:19,149
Oh, nerts to you.

26
00:02:19,227 --> 00:02:22,128
Don't tell me. Let me guess...
you're a doctor, right?

27
00:02:22,197 --> 00:02:25,792
And that man...
he has a crushed femoral artery.

28
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:29,530
- You'll have to take the leg.
- I looked at him. He's on his way.

29
00:02:29,604 --> 00:02:31,765
He's terrified he will be killed.

30
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,070
Tell him not to worry, Doctor.
Your patients are ours now.

31
00:02:34,142 --> 00:02:36,133
But I warn you,
we don't split fees.

32
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,181
- You know, I've been very
worried about you, Margaret.
- Really?

33
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,515
- You know, your fiance...
what's his name, uh, Ronald?
- Donald.

34
00:02:45,587 --> 00:02:47,578
- Right.
- Right.

35
00:02:47,656 --> 00:02:51,922
You know, maybe you're naive
and don't see that there are
deceitful people in this world.

36
00:02:51,993 --> 00:02:54,427
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about this in my tent...

37
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:56,555
- alone at night.
- Right, Frank.

38
00:02:56,631 --> 00:02:59,225
No, really. He just might be
stringing you along.

39
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,667
- He gave me a ring.
- Well, big deal.

40
00:03:02,737 --> 00:03:05,797
- Oh!
- He could be married, you know,
and didn't tell you.

41
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:10,004
- Remember how <i>our</i> relationship started?
- Right.

42
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:14,172
- Well, this guy should be eternally grateful.
- And internally grateful.

43
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:16,240
Okay, Kellye, you can close now.

[All Chattering]

45
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:22,481
Believe me, Major, I wouldn't operate
on this commie if Potter didn't make me.

46
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:27,187
- It really burns my butt.
- Mine too. You're not the only
real American here, Frank.

47
00:03:27,262 --> 00:03:29,787
I know, I know. I included your butt
right along with mine.

48
00:03:29,864 --> 00:03:32,424
You watch that mouth,
or I'll tell Donald.

49
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,468
"I'll tell Donald.
I'll tell Donald."

50
00:03:34,536 --> 00:03:36,766
Excuse me.
Could we get on with it?

51
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:40,296
- Oh, shut up!
- Have you been eavesdropping
on our conversation?

52
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,502
- I have tried not to.
- <i>[Frank] Listen, bub...</i>

53
00:03:42,577 --> 00:03:45,273
if you come out of this, you'd better
not repeat a word of what you've heard.

54
00:03:45,346 --> 00:03:49,510
- I promise.
- I'm so upset, Margaret.
Look at my hand shaking.

55
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:51,882
<i>[Margaret] Relax.</i>
<i>You'll feel better after the operation.</i>

56
00:03:51,953 --> 00:03:54,319
- How's it going, Frank?
- We're just about to operate
on your Commie friend.

57
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:56,380
Oh? I thought it was a rehearsal
for <i>The Bickersons.</i>

58
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,450
- All right, Margaret,
let's get this over with.
- Doctor... No. Wait!

59
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:03,691
- Doctor, could I ask a favor?
- Want me to put a nickel
in the parking meter?

60
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:08,225
Would it be possible for you to operate on me?
I don't think the major's heart is in it.

61
00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:12,399
Look, I didn't ask for this job. If you wanna
take over, Pierce, just say the word.

62
00:04:12,474 --> 00:04:15,807
- Please.
- On one condition. Do you have Blue Cross?

63
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:18,175
<i>Okay, Frank, I got him.</i>

64
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:20,544
You can have him.
I'd rather get some sleep.

65
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:23,209
- Gloves, please.
- Thank you, Doctor.

66
00:04:23,284 --> 00:04:27,084
You know, when I got
a haircut in the States...

67
00:04:27,155 --> 00:04:29,453
I always waited
for the head barber.

68
00:04:29,524 --> 00:04:31,515
Ah, it was worth it.

69
00:04:31,593 --> 00:04:35,120
How do you like it...
short on the top, thick on the sides?

70
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:37,289
- Margaret?
- Ready, Doctor.

71
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:40,266

you give him a manicure.

- Margaret?

83
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:23,206
Yes, sir. She says she needs
you right away, badly.

84
00:05:23,278 --> 00:05:25,371
I knew she'd come to her senses.
Where is she?

85
00:05:25,446 --> 00:05:28,973
- Post-op.
- Post-op? Is she crazy? Somebody will see us.

- I said I'd take you home,

- Hawkeye, wake up.
- Radar, do me a favor, will you?

88
00:05:37,926 --> 00:05:40,360
Drive this lady home.
My keys are in my sport coat.

Hey, listen! Wake up.
It's that North Korean.

Major Houlihan says
he tried to kill some guy.

93
00:05:50,772 --> 00:05:53,434
And you woke me up
just for that?

94
00:05:53,508 --> 00:05:56,170
This ought to keep him
in his place.

95
00:05:56,244 --> 00:05:58,235
- What are you doing, Frank?
- Strapping this heathen down.

96
00:05:58,313 --> 00:06:00,304
- He tried to kill that patient.
- Tried to kill him?

97
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:02,372
He was pulling out
his trach tube.

98
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,248
That's the way these yellow devils
think. It's burned into their brains.

99
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,618
Kill Americans. Kill! Kill!

100
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:11,284
They don't respect human life the way we do.
I'd like to take him out and shoot him.

101
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:13,190
- Brilliant.
- What happened?

102
00:06:13,261 --> 00:06:17,527
His tube was clogged. He couldn't
breathe, so I tried to clear it.

103
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:22,960
Nurse, clear that trach tube.

104
00:06:23,037 --> 00:06:25,028
Don't unleash him.
He's a killer.

105
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:27,597
- He was trying to help the guy.
- Why should he help one of our men?

106
00:06:27,675 --> 00:06:30,667
- I wouldn't help one of theirs.
- I think we should tell Colonel Potter.

- I dare you.
- I double dare you.

108
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:36,476
Nobody double dares me
and gets away with it.

00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:39,486
Don't worry about them. They don't
seem as bad as they really are.

After you've recovered, they'll
send you to a P.O.W. Camp.

00:06:59,274 --> 00:07:03,176
- I interned at Cooks County Hospital.
- Pretty good training.

- Evenin', boys.
- Klinger.

You know, I've been in combat
for almost three years...

119
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:18,223
but that still strikes me
as a very ugly woman.

120
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:22,059
You ought to see her naked.
Then we'd really have to strap you down.

<i>That makes a lot of sense.</i>

<i>Sure. He shot himself in the thigh</i>
<i>just to get in here, huh?</i>

Well, why not?
They're diabolical.

understand the Oriental mind the way I do.

What information could he get in here?

00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:43,917
- How many Q-Tips we've got?
How many suppositories?
- Right.

128
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:48,285
Why am I wasting time like this
when I could be sawing wood?

129
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:50,756
Let me put it this way,

You saved the leg.

00:08:03,805 --> 00:08:06,205
- How is that possible?
- New procedure.

134
00:08:06,274 --> 00:08:08,799
We took a section of the saphenous
vein, reversed it...

135
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:11,504
and grafted it
into the femoral artery.

136
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:14,412
So you can do that now.

137
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:16,473
I knew they were working
on such a thing.

You're so far ahead of us

You know, I wish
the circumstances were different...

get in touch with "l" Corps

00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:28,012
[High-Pitched Laugh]
You guys are kidding, right?

159
00:09:32,756 --> 00:09:36,453
Hey, that's a real problem.
"I" Corps disapproves of the enemy.

160
00:09:36,527 --> 00:09:39,121
It's not impossible, is it? I mean,
you've got low friends in high places.

161
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:41,187
- Be persuasive.
- Be charming.

162
00:09:41,265 --> 00:09:43,961
- Use force.
- No. I couldn't do that.

163
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:50,273
Beej, the, uh, the nurses' annual
physical is coming up soon, isn't it?

164
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:53,799
- Mm-hmm, and we're gonna
need an assistant.
- Oh, yeah.

165
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:56,675
Is that the, uh, complete physical,
same as last year?

166
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:59,181
- <i>[Hawkeye] It's better.</i>
- Mmm.

167
00:10:00,718 --> 00:10:04,119
We're gonna need a set of orders,
I.D., dog tags and a uniform.

168
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:07,555
With all that stuff, you could transfer
Flash Gordon to the outfit.

169
00:10:07,624 --> 00:10:10,889
- We don't want him. Bleaches his hair.
- Listen, um...

170
00:10:10,961 --> 00:10:13,589
Sparky could really help us on this,
but he's gonna want something.

171
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:16,258
- Something really good.
- We already anticipated that.

172
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,767
How would Sparky
like a solid gold Chinese watch...

173
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:21,202
taken directly from the wrist
of an enemy officer?

174
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:23,296
- With his permission, may I add.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

175
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:27,674
It's very nice, but he'd never be able to read
the time. It's got Chinese numbers on it.

176
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:30,509
- It comes with an instruction book.
- The symbol at the top is a 12.

177
00:10:30,581 --> 00:10:32,572
The one at the bottom is a six.

178
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:37,609
- They stole that from us.
- We stole waffles from them.

179
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:41,180
- I thought that was "psgetti."
- Come on. Come on. Will Sparky do it?

180
00:10:41,258 --> 00:10:46,457
Well, uh, for this watch, I think he
would probably transfer his own mother.

181
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,658
Have a safe journey.
Good luck and God be with you.

182
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,724
- Thank you.
- Aw, knock it off and get on the bus.

183
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:53,793
Frank has trouble
saying good-bye.

184
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:56,499
- You better move along
if you want a window seat.
- Yes.

185
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:04,846
Brokenhearted, Pierce, about losing
your good North Korean buddy?

186
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:07,281
No. I was getting
kinda tired of the guy.

187
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:10,115
He beat me out of eight bucks
in Chinese checkers.

188
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:12,917
<i>[Frank] Let's bring these men</i>
<i>up here and get 'em loaded.</i>

189
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,049
- <i>Come on.</i>
- [Engine Starts]

190
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:26,359
[Blows]

191
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:37,044
"Captain Cho Wunho,
board certified, Chicago, 1949."

192
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,844
- Welcome aboard, Captain.
- Thank you, Colonel.

193
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:44,411
Radar, this is the first time "l" Corps has
sent us help without us screaming about it.

194
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:46,820
Oh, yes, sir. That's right.
You know how it is.

195
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,826
Sometimes when you don't yell and holler
the loudest, they hear you the most.

196
00:11:50,894 --> 00:11:54,853
Well put. Can you find quarters
for the new doctor, Radar?

197
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:57,662
Um, your permission
to move him into the Swamp, sir?

198
00:11:57,734 --> 00:12:00,328
Oh. Okay.

199
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:02,395
But prepare yourself, Captain.

200
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:05,033
At first, your roommates
may appear a bit crazy.

201
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:07,906
But later on, you'll find out
they're only lunatics.

202
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,344
I'm accustomed to living
with Americans, Colonel.

203
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:12,641
Colonel? Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were busy.

204
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:15,378
<i>No. Come in, Major.</i>
<i>I'd like you to meet our new doctor.</i>

205
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:18,012
- Oh.
- <i>Major Houlihan, Captain Cho Wunho.</i>

206
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:22,718
- Haven't we met before?
- I was thinking the same thing.

207
00:12:22,793 --> 00:12:25,956
There's a little gin mill
in Seoul... the Pink Pagoda.

208
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:28,293
- Didn't we tango?
- Certainly not.

209
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:30,356
I mean, I've never been there.

210
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:33,232
- I must be mistaken.
- Perhaps I am also.

211
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:36,101
Uh, why don't you take the doctor
to his quarters, Radar.

212
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:39,040
Oh, right away, sir. Sir.

213
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:42,442
<i>Oh, Captain?</i>
<i>You'll go on duty at 1800 hours.</i>

214
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:45,880
Will somebody please call me?
I recently lost my watch.

215
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:48,850
Uh, that will be no problem, sir.
I'll-I'll call you.

216
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,279
I swear I know that man,
and I don't tango.

217
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,383
Maybe it was the cha-cha-cha.

218
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,852
I'm kidding.

219
00:13:06,803 --> 00:13:09,897
- <i>[Hawkeye] You wanna sponge that, Frank?</i>
- <i>[Frank] Okay, okay!</i>

220
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,679
Why do we need another doctor
all of a sudden?

221
00:13:17,748 --> 00:13:19,978
We've been short a doctor here
since the day you showed up.

222
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,041
I'm as good a doctor
as the next man.

223
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:24,451
Provided the next man
is Lou Costello.

224
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,124
You know, Major Houlihan and I think
there's something fishy about this Dr. Cho.

225
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:32,718
You'd think there was something fishy
about Albert Schweitzer.

226
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:35,629
There is. If he were a good doctor, he'd
be in Beverly Hills helping the wealthy.

227
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:37,860
<i>[Hawkeye]</i>
<i>Sponges, please. More sponges.</i>

228
00:13:37,935 --> 00:13:39,903
<i>Frank, I can't see.</i>
<i>You're standing in my light.</i>

229
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,268
[Whispering] Colonel, do you
wanna take a look at what he's doing?

230
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:44,466
<i>Frank, come on, will you!</i>

231
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:51,404
Clamp.

232
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,117
I've never seen a heminephrectomy
done like that, Doctor.

233
00:13:56,186 --> 00:13:59,349
- Where'd you pick that up?
- Professor Goodson in Chicago, sir.

234
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,755
<i>[Potter]</i>
<i>Ah. Read about it. Never seen it.</i>

235
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:04,089
Beautiful work.

236
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:07,619
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Mmm. Well, carry on.

237
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,861
<i>Halt!</i>

238
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:21,367
What's your business, gentlemen?

239
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:24,903
- You are a nurse?
- <i>No. I'm Corporal Klinger.</i>

240
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:28,349
I don't like to brag, but I made
this outfit myself. What do you think?

241
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:30,545
Most becoming.

242
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:33,522
We are from the KATUSA hospital
at Kumgang.

243
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,616
You have these supplies?

244
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:39,924
"Plasma, penicillin,
morphine, achromycin."

245
00:14:39,997 --> 00:14:41,988
Sounds like you're
opening a drugstore.

246
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:44,329
- What's goin' on here, Klinger?
- Oh, Major Burns, sir...

247
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:46,369
these men are from
the hospital at Kumgang.

248
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:48,597
- They need supplies.
- Forget it.

249
00:14:48,672 --> 00:14:50,936
We're not here to hand out supplies
to every Tom, Dick and Kwang.

250
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:55,069
- I'll check with Colonel Potter.
- Don't bother Potter. I can
say no all by myself. No!

251
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,875
But we must have these supplies.

252
00:14:57,948 --> 00:15:02,146
Pardon me, Major,
but what is your name, please?

253
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:04,084
Frank Burns.
What's it to you?

254
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:08,558
We have heard of a great doctor
called Frank Burns.

255
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,719
- Could you be him?
- Of course.

256
00:15:11,795 --> 00:15:15,060
We have heard that
he never turns down people in need...

257
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:18,067
that he is as generous
as he is skilled.

258
00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:22,538
Yeah, well, I'm, uh, sort of the
Albert Schweitzer of Korea, you know.

259
00:15:22,606 --> 00:15:24,733
What an honor it is to meet you.

260
00:15:24,808 --> 00:15:27,572
Oh. Well, what are you guys
standing around for?

261
00:15:27,644 --> 00:15:30,579
- Get these people what
they need and hurry up.
- Right away, sir!

262
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:42,957
Excuse me.
You're getting supplies for those men?

263
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:46,154
- Yes, sir. It's Major Burns's orders, sir.
- They are imposters, you know?

264
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:48,356
What? Who, sir?

265
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:51,458
The men in the jeep. It is
common practice to change uniforms...

266
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,901
and get supplies
from the units like these.

267
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,734
- You mean they're the enemy?
- Yes. Be careful of them.

268
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:59,537
- Hey, I gotta tell Colonel Potter.
- No.

269
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:02,100
They are desperate
and heavily armed.

270
00:16:02,179 --> 00:16:05,842
- W-Well, what should we do?
- The easiest way is to
give them what they want.

271
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,907
Then they will go, peacefully.

272
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,217
- Promise me something, Radar.
- Yeah?

273
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:17,783
If anything happens,
bury me in the blue chiffon.

274
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,322
You sure you fellas
won't come in for a cup of coffee?

275
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,491
There might even be some pudding
left over from lunch.

276
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:27,128
- I don't think so.
- It's rice pudding. You guys
are supposed to like that.

277
00:16:27,204 --> 00:16:31,664
No. No. We have no time.
We must get supplies and leave.

278
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:35,575
Uh, stay a while. I could tell you about
my work with, uh, arterial transplants.

279
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:40,275
- Some other time.
- Hey, I just had a wild thought.

280
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,945
How would it be if I came back
with you guys to your hospital...

281
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,011
give all your staff
a chance to meet me?

282
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,614
We could get everybody together,
and I could give them a talk. Huh?

283
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:50,683
N-No. We must leave quickly.

284
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:54,060
You know, perhaps the major
has a good idea.

285
00:16:54,131 --> 00:16:57,328
Yes. I think
he would be quite useful.

286
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,300
I'd have to be back
in a couple of hours.

287
00:16:59,369 --> 00:17:02,133
<i>That is no problem.</i>
<i>The hospital is close by.</i>

288
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:04,696
- Great.
- Uh, wait a minute. Major, where you goin'?

289
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:07,141
I'm going with these boys back
to meet everyone at their hospital.

290
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,201
- Should be a real treat for 'em.
- You can't do that, Major!

291
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,611
- What?
- What he means is, uh, you can't leave us.

292
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:14,479
- What would we do without you?
- What are you talking about? I'm off duty.

293
00:17:14,551 --> 00:17:16,542
Well, sir, who's gonna help us
plan the dance tonight?

294
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,589
- Ah! The dance.
- What dance? Nobody told me
about any dance.

295
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:21,817
- Let's all go to the colonel's
office and discuss it, sir.
- The colonel's office.

296
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:24,861
Let go, and that's an order!
These boys are in a big hurry.

297
00:17:24,928 --> 00:17:26,919
That is true.
We must go now.

298
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:30,592
Major, what about the class
this afternoon? You know, on
how to recognize the <i>enemy.</i>

299
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,658
You had all that
in basic training.

300
00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:34,761
If you can't recognize the enemy by now,
you're in a lot of trouble.

301
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:36,863
[Chuckling]
All set. Let's go!

302
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:43,335
Break a leg.

303
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:45,938
I've seen the man work.
He's a qualified surgeon.

304
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:48,883
He gives me the creeps.
He's always watching everything.

305
00:17:48,952 --> 00:17:51,512
Last night, I came out of the shower,
and, sure enough, there he was.

306
00:17:51,588 --> 00:17:54,318
That is suspicious.
Last night was supposed to be my night.

307
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:57,155
- Colonel?
- What do you want me to do?

308
00:17:57,227 --> 00:17:59,661
Just check up on him.
That's all I ask.

309
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:03,460
Colonel Potter! Sir? Major Burns
just drove off with two men in a jeep.

310
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:05,485
They were bad men, sir.
I think they were the enemy.

311
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,176
What men? What jeep?
What enemy?

312
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,916
These two guys come in asking for supplies,
so we give them what they want.

313
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,254
And then Major Burns gets in the jeep
with them and goes off.

314
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,886
- Why? Did they force him?
- No, ma'am. I think he wanted to go.

315
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:19,193
Radar, get on the phone, call
the M.P. S, alert them about that jeep.

316
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,665
- Yes, sir.
- Wait a minute. Radar?

317
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:25,295
- How do you know those men
were enemy soldiers?
- Captain Cho told us.

318
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,363
- Captain Cho? How did he know?
- I don't know. He just knew.

319
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:33,436
- Well, isn't that interesting?
- Hmm.

320
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:46,084
- Oh, what is it now?
- Sir.

321
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:49,617
- I.D.'s, please.
- Why are you stopping us? Been a slow day?

322
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:51,687
Need a little excitement
to break up the monotony?

323
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,857
We have important business
to attend to.

324
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:57,232
Sorry, sir, but there have been some
infiltrators coming down to get supplies.

325
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,363
Oh, these men are not infiltrators.
One good look should tell you that.

326
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,501
Now, listen. I am
Major Frank Burns, MASH 4077 th.

327
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:07,637
- <i>The</i> Major Burns.
I'm sure you've heard of me.
- Mm-hmm.

328
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:10,740
Well, of course you have.
I can vouch for these men personally.

329
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,718
- <i>[M.P.] We're checking everybody, Major.</i>
- <i>Now, listen, Sergeant...</i>

330
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:16,050
instead of bothering doctors who are
trying to do some good in this world...

331
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:18,056
why don't you run out and
catch some... kidnappers?

332
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,058
Let's go.

333
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:26,758
I should have done something
to save Major Burns, but I was afraid.

334
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:31,361
If those men had recognized me,
they would have panicked.

335
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:35,100
- Look, you did what you could.
- Yeah. Look at the bright side...
maybe they'll keep him.

336
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,736
Well, I'm glad you're all here.

337
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,804
Ah, Colonel Potter.
What a surprise.

338
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:45,612
- I'm glad we had the furniture cleaned.
- The new drapes are due Friday.

339
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,449
Okay, cut the phony baloney.
The ball game's over.

340
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,853
- What's up?
- <i>I just checked with Headquarters...</i>

341
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:54,382
and I know all about Paik
or Cho or whatever your name is.

342
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,451
I'm gonna have to
put you under arrest.

343
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:00,431
Colonel, you're not gonna throw away a
perfectly good doctor on a technicality?

344
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,968
"Technicality"?
This man's the enemy.

345
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,766
- Enemy "schmenemy." He's a surgeon.
- And a good one.

346
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:09,535
Please, gentlemen.
I knew it couldn't last.

347
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,908
- I just wanted to help.
- Look, I understand what
you were trying to do...

348
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:15,880
and between you, me and
the grand piano, it wasn't a bad idea.

349
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:19,715
But damn it! I could lose my pension,
wind up in the stockade.

350
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:22,346
- There must be some way we can keep him.
- Nada.

351
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,050
It was Houlihan and Burns
who put the bee on him.

352
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:27,354
If they can figure it out,
anybody can.

353
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:30,328
Well, that's true.

354
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,387
- Dr. Paik, I'm sorry.
- Me too.

355
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,865
You did what you could.

356
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:37,368
You don't suppose your side
would be interested in an exchange?

357
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:41,237
We keep you and they keep Frank?
No, they'd never go for that.

358
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:44,708
[Frank] Why don't I start out
with a couple of jokes...

359
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,473
then go into a personal
autobiography of myself.

360
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:50,710
I'll tell them about the Boy Scouts,
how I rode a two-wheeler at 13...

361
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:55,186
and how I worked my way through med school
selling burial plots door to door.

362
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,246
I wish I had time
to get a haircut.

363
00:20:57,323 --> 00:21:00,224
Well, they'll understand.
After all, it's war.

364
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:03,524
Did I mention
that I taught my rabbit how to smile?

365
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:06,756
- [Engine Stops]
- Why did we stop?

366
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:10,132
[Sighs]

367
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:12,194
Get out.

368
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:15,435
Why? Something wrong with the jeep?
Don't tell me we're out of gas.

369
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:19,467
We are past the checkpoint,
and we don't need you anymore.

370
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,979
Besides,
you're driving us crazy...

371
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,039
and we don't need
a hostage that badly.

372
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,677
- Get out.
- What do you mean?

373
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:30,382
You simpleton.
We are North Koreans.

374
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,118
Honest Injun?

375
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:35,956
Don't hurt me!
I'll tell you anything you wanna know.

376
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:39,988
- Get out of the jeep.
- You're not gonna torture me or anything?

377
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:42,057
Some other time.

378
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:46,299
Go back to your camp. It's the
best thing you could do for our side.

379
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:52,034
You ungrateful creeps!

380
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:55,603
I wouldn't lecture to you if you got
down on your knees and begged me!

381
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,866
[Sighs]
Well, I'm sorry it didn't work out.

382
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:18,927
- And you lost your watch too.
- Forget it.

383
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,996
With those Chinese characters...

384
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:23,065
I could never read it anyway.

385
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:25,337
Here. Take this.
It's a little going-away present.

386
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:27,402
A cake we made in the Mess.

387
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,540
- Thank you.
- Don't thank us till you taste it.

388
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:34,017
Cheer up, gentlemen.
The war will not last forever.

389
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:36,555
Yeah. Maybe afterwards,
you'll come to the States sometime...

390
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:39,022
and we'll all get together
and have a few beers.

391
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:41,993
Or perhaps you'll take
an exotic cruise to my country...

392
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:44,052
and we'll share some rice wine.

393
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,758
I bet you know some terrific places
for Chinese food.

394
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,301
One or two...

395
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,860
but they're in Chicago.

396
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:53,929
Good-bye.

397
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:09,547
Geez, he was
a pretty good doctor.

398
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:12,750
- What a waste.
- I just hope he doesn't
take a bite out of that cake.

399
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:16,386
- There's a saw in it.
- [Chuckles]

400
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:23,458
Major.

401
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,231
[No Audible Dialogue]

402
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,941
- <i>[Crickets Chirping]</i>
- Those clowns didn't fool me for a minute.

403
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:42,010
- I knew they were Commies the whole time.
- Then why did you go with them?

404
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:45,580
- I figured I'd gather a little intelligence.
- You could use it.

405
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,853
They pulled guns on me, so I gave
them both a quick karate chop...

406
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,918
knocked 'em cold
and headed back to camp.

407
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:53,432
- Why didn't you bring back the jeep?
- The jeep?

408
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,490
<i>Yeah, thejeep.</i>
<i>It's a big green thing.</i>

409
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:57,661
Looks like a turtle
with a thyroid condition.

410
00:23:57,737 --> 00:24:01,571
<i>You let a jeep filled with medical</i>
<i>supplies fall into enemy hands.</i>

411
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:04,667
Well, it was
the humanitarian thing to do.

412
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:08,202
I mean, after all, they may be Commies,
but they're people too, sort of.

413
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:12,240
Good. We've got a whole tent filled with
North Koreans in need of attention.

414
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:14,912
- They're all yours.
- All by myself?

415
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:17,683
Don't whine, Frank.
You're the humanitarian.

416
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:20,555
- Oh, and what are you guys?
- We're all-night poker players.

417
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,787
- Come on, Hawk, Colonel.
- Good night, Albert.

418
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,853
Good night, Dr. Schweitzer.

419
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,523
Whole tent full?
