On my first day at work,

172
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:36,793
the person I was replacing
picked me up at home.

173
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,963

the best place to train

174

an inexperienced
security guy like me was

175
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:48,138

facility in Jerusalem.

176
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:50,265

<i>PERY. You need to make
the suspect feel tense.</i>

183
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:30,472
You need to make him understand

184
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:34,226
that when we are done, he
will give up his information,

185
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,394

Shin Bet intelligence-wise.

00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:48,932

mechanism that, since then,

exist between us.

that I would take
ministerial responsibility,

748
01:02:16,987 --> 01:02:19,281
and submit my resignation.

749
01:02:19,364 --> 01:02:21,825

from the West Bank.

759
01:03:01,865 --> 01:03:05,285
It will come from every direction,
mainly from the rabbis,

760
01:03:05,369 --> 01:03:09,456
because the rabbis have
no reason to learn any lesson.

As far as the extremist rabbis are
concerned, the system proved itself.

762

brought me to the Shin Bet.

and they had to be developed.

we were relying on force,
