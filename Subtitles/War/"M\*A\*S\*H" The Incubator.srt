Trapper?

5
00:01:45,698 --> 00:01:50,465
I'm not going to talk
unless you stop screaming.

6
00:01:50,536 --> 00:01:53,198
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:55,763

I shave my tongue.

From the ankles up.

11
00:02:13,192 --> 00:02:15,888
Everything above that,
I leave to science.

12
00:02:18,664 --> 00:02:22,896
I think one of us should try
breathing on a mirror.

13
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:24,960
Okay.

14
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:28,435

I need a doctor.

17
00:02:39,051 --> 00:02:42,020
- You're a doctor.
- Then I'm the last thing I need.

18
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:48,016
Well, at least everybody
cleaned up before they left.

<i>You suppose we died</i>
<i>and we've gone into the army?</i>

20
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,793
Possible.

21
00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:06,010
Who's that?
I don't know him, do I?

22
00:03:06,078 --> 00:03:09,912
That's Dr. Klein.
Eye, ear, nose and guitar.

- <i>Is he alive?</i>
- <i>Yes, but his guts are in bad shape.</i>

24
00:03:15,254 --> 00:03:19,816
- Shall we wake him?
- No. Look what waking up did for us.

25
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:22,360
- <i>[Radar] Morning, sirs.</i>
- Ohh!

26
00:03:22,428 --> 00:03:24,953
<i>What a rotten thing to say.</i>

27
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:27,090

- Wow!
- There were no survivors.

29
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:34,701
- Is that coffee?
- Oh, yeah, I figured you'd need some.

30
00:03:34,774 --> 00:03:37,038
Gimme, gimme.

31
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:39,202
I'll take mine here.

32

- Is that Dr. Klein?
- It was.

33
00:03:42,982 --> 00:03:46,941
We're gonna wake him so he can do
an autopsy on himself later.

34
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,681
Oh. Here's your cases for today.

35
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:56,656
Radar, I have the impression that
we woke you about 3:30 this morning.

36
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:00,790
- No. It was ten to 4:00.
- Did we say why?

37
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:04,996
Uh, you said you wanted
to sacrifice a virgin.

38
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:07,301
- Did we?
- I was too sleepy.

39
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:19,308
- Frank?
- Hmm?

40
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,147
- No comment about this?
- About us?

41
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:29,388
[Laughs] Not today, Doctors.
I'm not playing.

42
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:38,269
You're not going
to debauch all night,

43
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:40,328
and then expect me to cleanse you
with a tongue-lashing.

00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:42,670
I'm not your mother.

45

- Come on, Mom. Please.

- No.
- <i>You have to.</i>

How will we know what a good time we had
unless you tell us how rotten we are?

48
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:54,886
<i>It's senseless.</i>

00:04:54,954 --> 00:04:57,354
You continue to waste your off-hours
in riotous living...

to the detriment of yourselves
as doctors and people.

51
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,862
You know, he's right.

52
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,955
You know, you're right.

53
00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:08,932

to take that from you.

- And broads.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

56
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:20,712
What happened to those two bright-eyed,
bushy-tailed young surgeons I once knew?

57
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,770
Was that us?

58
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:25,681
We're going to get
our tails bushed again.

59
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:28,117
Come on.
Let's make our rounds.

60
00:05:32,258 --> 00:05:34,852
Twelve hours of I.V.,
then put a ticket on him to Tokyo.

61
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:36,861
Yes, Doctor.

62
00:05:46,572 --> 00:05:49,439
Yesterday, remember?
Multiple chest.

63
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:51,499
Wish you were talking about a nurse.

64
00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:54,512
Come on, bushy tail.
We got fever.

65
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,515
Nurse, give me an ice pack here.

66
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,177
Hiya, Rizzo. How you doing?

67
00:06:03,055 --> 00:06:05,888
My partner and I operated on you.

68
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:09,519
- Let's stop this fever stuff.
- You're gonna make us look like bums.

69
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:11,563
We don't need any help
in that department.

70
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:21,404
He had a full course of penicillin.
He's not responding.

71
00:06:21,473 --> 00:06:24,931
Let's take some blood cultures and see
what kind of germ factory this kid is.

72
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,639
- Nurse?
- Where do you want the ice pack?

73
00:06:30,983 --> 00:06:33,134
Take some blood cultures
of Rizzo again.

74
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:36,465
Rizzo. I did a white count on him.
What's the problem?

75
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:38,937
We don't know.
Complications. Fever.

76
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:41,874
Okay. I'll ship this off
to the Tokyo lab.

77
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,639
We'll know what he has in 72 hours,
then you can treat him.

78
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:46,646
Seventy-two hours?

79
00:06:46,714 --> 00:06:49,274
The kid's so hot now,
you can fry an egg on his head.

80
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,547
Why don't we have an incubator here
so we can do our own tests?

81
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,851
Because it would save time and effort,
and it would make sense.

82
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:57,858
Can't have any of that
in the army.

83
00:06:57,926 --> 00:07:00,019
All right. Ship it right away.
Next chopper.

84
00:07:00,094 --> 00:07:02,062
Mark it "soonest." Trap.

85
00:07:03,698 --> 00:07:06,258
Okeydokey!

86
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:10,464
I want you to secure legs
"A," "B," "C" and "D" to the fire bowl.

87
00:07:10,538 --> 00:07:15,066
Then I put rack "A" into slot "A,"
using washers 1, 2 and 3.

88
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,203
Now all we have to do is tighten her up
and find our place for the spits...

89
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,304
And we got our own barbecue.

90
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:27,953
I tell ya, Radar, I gotta
hand it to the U.S. Army, boy.

91
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:30,286
They take care of their own.

92
00:07:30,358 --> 00:07:34,624
You know, sir, I have a friend
down in the 331 st Evac.

93
00:07:34,696 --> 00:07:38,826
He says that they just got a
20-by-40 foot inflatable swimming pool.

94
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,130
Hey, why don't we put in for one?

95
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:43,796
Well, most of the time
it's freezing cold here, sir.

96
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,773
We could stock it with trout.
They're great barbecued.

97
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:52,006
Oh, yes, sir.
You gonna wanna use this tonight?

98
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,674
You betcha.
I want you to go see the cook.

99
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:56,444
He's still in the hospital, sir.

100
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,951
- Really?
- <i>Captain Pierce said,</i>

101
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,989
he oughta be on a food-free diet.

102
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:04,786
Well, then go see
whoever's in charge.

103
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,327
I want a couple of steaks about yea big.

104
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:10,455
I'm going to put
those babies on tonight.

105
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,625
Just show 'em the fire.
I like my steaks rare.

106
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,566
Yes, sir.

107
00:08:15,636 --> 00:08:20,300
They gotta scream when you cut into 'em.
I fix 'em my own way.

108
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,468
Sprinkle sugar and pour brandy on 'em.

109
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,068
Uh-huh.

110
00:08:25,146 --> 00:08:29,708
- Got a minute, Henry?
- Look at this, guys. Our own barbecue.

111
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:32,719
I'll show you amateurs
how to put on a party.

112
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:35,551
We're through with parties
for a while, Henry.

113
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:37,614
Well, you'll never top last night.

114
00:08:37,692 --> 00:08:40,718
That was a real wingding.
[Chuckles]

115
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:45,892
I'd have bet anything you couldn't
get four people inside a sleeping bag.

116
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:49,232
Henry, we're going back into medicine.
You wanna join us?

117
00:08:49,303 --> 00:08:52,534
- Come again?
- Our lab needs an incubator.

118
00:08:52,607 --> 00:08:55,440
Yeah. We could speed up diagnoses
and treatment by days.

119
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,705
Well, hell!
We just got the barbecue.

120
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,179
I can't pester them for an incubator.

121
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,911
Tell them we decided to open up
a hospital instead of a restaurant.

122
00:09:03,985 --> 00:09:07,682
- How do we requisition an incubator?
- <i>Now just hold it!</i>

123
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:12,021
I'm sick and tired of you guys
going over my head down to Radar!

124
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,790
- Oh, I don't mind, sir.
- Well, I do!

125
00:09:15,863 --> 00:09:18,491
Now, look, this little fella's
got plenty of work to do...

126
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:21,262
without you guys heaping
more responsibility on him.

127
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:24,668
- Go get those steaks, Radar.
- Yes, sir.

128
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:28,698
Henry, we got a patient
with an infection we can't identify.

129
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,711
- All because we don't have an incubator.
- All right, that's a point.

130
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:35,215
Make a note of it, put it in
my in-basket, and I'll get right on it.

131
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:39,219
Leaving an idea with you is like
abandoning a baby in a garbage can.

132
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,381
Now, that's unfair.
I do plenty around here every day.

133
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,391
I just don't make
a lot of noise about it.

134
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,518
Yeah, you're one
of those quiet sleepers.

135
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:48,755
- What about the incubator?
- We need it.

136
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,492
Those things cost
five or six hundred dollars.

137
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:53,500
The war's been running
for two years.

138
00:09:53,568 --> 00:09:56,332
The government must be showing
a profit by now.

139
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:00,273
All right, all right.
Let's get one.

140
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:04,107
Now, that's the Henry we all
sing about around the campfire.

141
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:05,611
- Radar!
- Radar!

142
00:10:08,683 --> 00:10:10,617
- Colonel Blake?
- Yo.

143
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:13,620
Captain Sloan from Quartermaster
Corps here to see you, sir.

144
00:10:15,356 --> 00:10:18,120
- Colonel.
- Captain. Radar, would you...

145
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:20,126
Captains Pierce and Mclntyre
are on their way, sir.

146
00:10:20,194 --> 00:10:23,288
Fine, fine. Just so long as they know
I want to see them before they get here.

147
00:10:23,364 --> 00:10:27,391
- Yes, sir.
- Sit down, sit down.

148
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:29,663
- Care for a drink?
- Never touch it.

149
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:31,671
- Ah. Smoke?
- No, thank you.

150
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,735
Well, that only leaves sex.

151
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:39,143
Afraid we can't help you there.

152
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:46,009
Say, you guys in Quartermaster
are doing a bang-up job.

153
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:50,046
I mean, everybody seems to have
plenty of guns and bullets and stuff.

154
00:10:50,124 --> 00:10:52,558
Wouldn't be much of a war without you.

155
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:54,060
We hold our end up.

156
00:10:54,128 --> 00:10:57,825
You do that around here,
you get your temperature taken.

157
00:11:03,938 --> 00:11:06,463
<i>Oh, Captain Sloan,</i>
<i>these are Captain Pierce</i>...

158
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,772
- And these are Captain Mclntyre.
- Hi. How about a snort, Henry?

159
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:13,109
- Hey, we took the pledge, remember?
- Oh.

160
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:14,876
- B.T.
- B.T.?

is with Supply.

Maybe I'll have that drink.

166
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:31,857
The business at hand
is an incubator,

167
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:35,733
that is if my Lieutenant understood what
your colonel said you captains want.

168
00:11:35,803 --> 00:11:38,704
- Right.
- And we need one as soon as possible.

169
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:42,038
- Let's see what the good book says.
- The good book?

170
00:11:42,109 --> 00:11:44,236
<i>The Manual of Supply and Requisition.</i>

171
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:47,042
<i>MANSUPREQ.</i>

172
00:11:47,114 --> 00:11:52,211
Um, "inhalator, indicator,
innoculator, infusilator..."

173
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:55,847
Here it is: 437-stroke-R2,
incubator.

174
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:59,586
Thar she blows!

175
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,891
<i>"Device for developing</i>
<i>bacterial cultures...</i>

176
00:12:02,964 --> 00:12:05,728
at constant suitable temperatures."

177
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,327
Uh-huh. I see.
That certainly makes sense.

178
00:12:12,636 --> 00:12:14,604
You can't have one.

179
00:12:17,307 --> 00:12:23,143
- Beg your pardon?
- I checked your basic equipment list.

180
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:25,147
This unit has everything
it's supposed to have.

181
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:29,413
You're not entitled to an incubator.
That would be a... a luxury.

182
00:12:29,486 --> 00:12:33,786
- Luxury?
- We're not asking for a pizza oven.

183
00:12:33,857 --> 00:12:36,917
- Oh, that I can let you have.
- <i>No kidding!</i>

184
00:12:36,993 --> 00:12:39,689
Hey, that would be great
on movie nights.

185
00:12:39,763 --> 00:12:42,323
You got any pizza requisition forms?

186
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:48,201
Just use the standard S-1798 and write
in "pizza" where it says "machine gun."

187
00:12:50,573 --> 00:12:54,100
- Captain, are you saying no?
- It's my job to say no.

188
00:12:54,177 --> 00:12:55,701
You do it very well.

189
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:58,714
I imagine you'll open up
a "no" stand after the war.

190
00:12:58,782 --> 00:13:02,445
You ever been in a hospital and your
doctors didn't know what to do for you?

191
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,955
- <i>[Knocks Wood]</i>
- I've never had a sick day in my life.

192
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:08,286
Was that your own idea
or an order?

193
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:11,725
Can the snottiness, Pierce.
Man's only trying to do his job.

194
00:13:11,795 --> 00:13:13,558
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Sorry, Captain.

195
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,064
"Thank you, Colonel.
Sorry, Captain. Sorry, patient.

196
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:18,362
"You have a temperature
of a 109-stroke-10.

197
00:13:18,435 --> 00:13:21,563
"You can't have an incubator, but you
can have a pizza with everything to go.

198
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:23,572
Unless, of course, you go first."

199
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,505
Let's stay on the ground,
shall we, Pierce?

200
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:28,476
Does the book allow us
any ground, Captain?

201
00:13:28,545 --> 00:13:30,945
Otherwise, I'm afraid I'll have
to ask you all to take a step up.

202
00:13:31,014 --> 00:13:33,505
- Into limbo.
- No, you can't have any limbo.

203
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,517
In fact, you can't have
anything-stroke-nothing,

204
00:13:35,585 --> 00:13:37,849
which is not approved by STATQUOPAC.

205
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:40,151
Which is enough
to make you reach for Al RSICKBAG.

206
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,488
Just hold it, Pierce!

207
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,996
Captain, I'd like to formally
apologize for the 4077 th.

208
00:13:47,063 --> 00:13:48,997
Have you got any
apology forms in there?

209
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:53,297
We're gonna get that incubator. We're
gonna go forth and part the red tape.

210
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,395
I'll drink to that.

211
00:13:55,472 --> 00:13:58,305
- Will Scotch be all right, sir?
- Yeah, fine, Radar. Perfect.

212
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,105
I ran out of ice, sir,
so I used bourbon.

213
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:05,880
Radar, I want you to get on the pipe
and find us an incubator.

214
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:07,940
Don't stop until you locate one.

215
00:14:08,017 --> 00:14:11,145
- Is that an order, sir?
- Sure sounded like one to me.

216
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:14,915
Well, everybody, happy days.

217
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:18,385
Stroke, cheers.

218
00:14:24,134 --> 00:14:26,898
- <i>I'm going to resect this intestine.</i>
- I'm with you.

219
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,906
- Number ten blade.
- Anything that wiggles is my fingers.

220
00:14:30,974 --> 00:14:33,772
- Number ten.
- I think it's safer with Frank, Henry,

221
00:14:33,843 --> 00:14:35,868
if you hold his knife still
and move the patient back and forth.

222
00:14:35,945 --> 00:14:38,175
I'm doing just fine!

223
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:45,248
Colonel Blake?

224
00:14:45,321 --> 00:14:47,789
Show it to Pierce.

225
00:14:47,857 --> 00:14:50,325
- Doctor? From Radar.
- Yes.

226
00:14:50,393 --> 00:14:54,659
Can I see the X-ray?
A little higher.

227
00:14:54,731 --> 00:14:57,962
Hey, terrific.
He's located an incubator.

228
00:14:58,034 --> 00:15:02,095
Three of them at the 728th Evac
in Pusan. A Major Arnold Morris.

229
00:15:02,172 --> 00:15:06,506
- Jackpot.
- Three cherries straight across. Thanks.

230
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:10,012
Aw, jeepers. Whew!

231
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,309
Guess where we're going
after surgery, Henry.

232
00:15:12,382 --> 00:15:14,680
Oh? Without my permission?

233
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:17,743
- Don't we have it?
- Of course you do.

234
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:19,812
You think I'd let you leave
without my permission?

235
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:22,756
- Ha! An incubator.
- Three.

236
00:15:22,826 --> 00:15:26,057
May I remind you both that not everybody
you'll meet down there...

237
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:28,654
is going to be lovable
Colonel Henry Blake.

238
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:30,824
What are you trying to tell us,
lovable Colonel Henry Blake?

239
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:36,429
Take my advice. Don't show up looking
like freelance abortionists. Shape up.

240
00:15:36,506 --> 00:15:40,374
Good thinking, Henry.
I'll wear my pinks. How about you, Mary?

241
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:42,343
Can we cut the gab in here?

242
00:15:45,648 --> 00:15:47,912
Aw, look at that.

243
00:15:51,754 --> 00:15:55,656
"Maintains temperature
at a constant 37 degrees centigrade."

244
00:15:55,725 --> 00:15:59,320
The army guarantees it for a year
or two wars, whichever comes first.

245
00:15:59,395 --> 00:16:02,558
Just think of the germs we can hatch
in that. Makes your mouth water.

246
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:05,499
- And it's never been used.
- These are still in their crates.

247
00:16:05,568 --> 00:16:09,629
<i>And they're gonna stay that way.</i>
<i>I'm Major Morris.</i>

248
00:16:09,706 --> 00:16:11,799
- Captain Pierce.
- Mclntyre. 4077 MASH...

249
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:15,971
- You want an incubator. No dice.
- But you've got three.

250
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:18,013
That's right. If I give one away,
I'll only have two.

251
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:21,175
- What's wrong with two?
- Two is not as good as three.

252
00:16:21,251 --> 00:16:23,583
- But you're not even using them.
- Who says I have to?

253
00:16:23,653 --> 00:16:27,419
- <i>What do you do when you want a culture?</i>
- I send a smear to Tokyo.

254
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,620
If I use one of these and it breaks
down, then I'll only have two.

255
00:16:31,694 --> 00:16:35,596
- That's a sick attitude.
- Well, they're mine.

256
00:16:35,665 --> 00:16:37,599
Just lend us one.
Anytime you want,

257
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:40,101
you can come over
and borrow a cup of germs.

258
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:42,467
You guys...

259
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:46,669
rich, young draftee doctors
all dressed up like drum majorettes.

260
00:16:46,743 --> 00:16:49,940
Rich? Some of my patients
pay me in kittens.

261
00:16:50,013 --> 00:16:54,006
I never made more than
$10,000 a year in my life.

262
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,348
I was a pediatrician
in a women's prison.

263
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,684
Well, look, Major,
we're not here from <i>True Confessions.</i>

264
00:16:59,756 --> 00:17:03,283
You're not here for no incubator
neither. What's mine is mine.

265
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:06,851
- But in triplicate?
- He's a three-lane schizophrenic.

266
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:12,492
Say, you know, I think I know
how we can solve this problem.

267
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:15,333
Why don't you guys just salute
and get the hell on out of here?

268
00:17:15,405 --> 00:17:18,306
Who's your commanding officer?

269
00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:20,934
Colonel Lambert
is commanding officer of this base.

270
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,776
- Where would we find him?
- Nowhere on the base, that's for sure.

271
00:17:24,847 --> 00:17:27,941
- Got his own house?
- He's got two of them.

272
00:17:28,017 --> 00:17:30,986
One blonde and one brunette.

273
00:17:32,922 --> 00:17:35,550
We've gotten nothing
but static so far, Colonel.

274
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:39,083
First from a supply captain who won't
tie his shoe without a direct order.

275
00:17:39,162 --> 00:17:41,153
Then from a Major Morris,
who, in civilian life,

276
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,666
- is known as Leopold and Loeb.
- All we want is an incubator.

277
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:48,363
For the simple purpose of practicing
better and more efficient medicine.

278
00:17:49,906 --> 00:17:52,033
Sir, I appeal to your sense
of what's right.

279
00:17:54,277 --> 00:17:56,973
They're full of it.

280
00:17:58,281 --> 00:18:00,841
That'll be all... for now.

281
00:18:05,555 --> 00:18:10,015
I think we'll have lavender
in the bath this afternoon, my dear.

282
00:18:10,093 --> 00:18:12,118
Okay, Daddy.

283
00:18:16,132 --> 00:18:19,761
- Now, gentlemen, an incubator.
- Yes, sir.

284
00:18:19,836 --> 00:18:22,703
Were you interested in just the one?

285
00:18:22,772 --> 00:18:25,707
Yes, Colonel.

286
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:30,610
If I'm not mistaken,
that lists for 627.50, F.O.B., Inchon.

287
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,581
<i>Freight, handling, re-stenciling.</i>

288
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,584
An even thousand should handle it.

289
00:18:35,652 --> 00:18:38,519
- A thousand dollars?
- Cash.

290
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:40,715
Ah!

291
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,122
Preparing a little doggie bag
for Switzerland, Colonel?

292
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:46,423
That was a perfect diagnosis, Doctor.

293
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:49,226
Wait a minute.
You sell incubators?

294
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:53,098
Oh, yes.
Sterilizers, ice cream makers,

295
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:56,536
<i>pontoon bridges, jeeps,</i>

296
00:18:56,606 --> 00:19:00,007
and, with a week's notice,
the odd B-52.

297
00:19:00,076 --> 00:19:02,169
The crew is extra, of course.

298
00:19:03,713 --> 00:19:06,147
If you're looking
for a real bargain,

299
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:08,911
I can let you have a half-million rolls
of toilet paper,

300
00:19:08,985 --> 00:19:10,953
which I happen to be sitting on.

301
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:14,954
- Bravo, Colonel.
- Thank you.

302
00:19:15,024 --> 00:19:17,083
Have you ever thought of
opening your own country?

303
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,186
- You're a thief!
- Of course.

304
00:19:20,263 --> 00:19:24,324
Why should the sergeants
have all the fun? [Chuckles]

305
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,426
More tea? Why don't you try
one of these rice cookies?

306
00:19:27,503 --> 00:19:29,095
How much?

307
00:19:31,841 --> 00:19:33,832
I like you.

308
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,140
You have a nasty streak of morality.

309
00:19:38,314 --> 00:19:40,282
But I like you.

310
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:43,216
I'm gonna let you have that incubator...

311
00:19:43,286 --> 00:19:46,483
for $627, cost.

312
00:19:48,024 --> 00:19:50,458
Plus ten percent for tolerance.

313
00:19:50,526 --> 00:19:54,485
Colonel, unlike you,
we're a nonprofit organization.

314
00:19:54,564 --> 00:19:56,998
Our outfit is a bunch of
little khaki church mice.

315
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:59,330
I'd like to help you.
Really, I should.

316
00:19:59,402 --> 00:20:02,769
But if I started doing my duty,
where would I wind up?

317
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,399
Well, Trap?
Onward and upward?

318
00:20:07,476 --> 00:20:09,808
That would lead you
to General Mitchell.

319
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:11,813
General Maynard M. Mitchell.

320
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:14,679
<i>[Lambert]</i>
<i>Honest, true-blue as the day is long...</i>

321
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,242
<i>and about as interesting</i>
<i>as a five-pound bag of fertilizer.</i>

322
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,654
Ladies and gentlemen, General Mitchell
will now answer your questions.

323
00:20:22,725 --> 00:20:26,388
Thank you. Uh, Mr. Bowman.

324
00:20:26,462 --> 00:20:31,195
General, today's news handout contains
casualty figures and bomb tonnage.

325
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:33,201
Is there anything you can add?

326
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:36,534
No. Only I would add
that there's nothing to add.

327
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:39,733
General, what can you tell us
about the rumored peace talks?

328
00:20:39,808 --> 00:20:44,677
I'm glad you brought that up, and I want
to caution you all the press here...

329
00:20:44,747 --> 00:20:50,117
that irresponsible leaks in this area
may lead this war to a premature peace.

330
00:20:50,185 --> 00:20:54,622
General, can you tell us why
MASH units never get any incubators?

331
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,219
Our people have this question
under scrutiny at the moment.

332
00:20:59,295 --> 00:21:02,093
Now, if this scrutinization
should yield negative,

333
00:21:02,164 --> 00:21:05,691
then I feel that we must
maximize our efforts. Next.

334
00:21:05,768 --> 00:21:07,736
Sir, I don't want to minimize
your maximize,

335
00:21:07,803 --> 00:21:11,398
but why aren't field hospitals
properly supplied with incubators?

336
00:21:11,473 --> 00:21:14,636
Hospitals which surprisingly attract
a great number of wounded people.

337
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,543
That question has
a lot of buckshot in it.

338
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:19,945
I'm sure the answer will too.

339
00:21:20,015 --> 00:21:22,040
Let me say this.
The United States Army is...

340
00:21:22,117 --> 00:21:26,451
the best equipped fighting force since
the Roman legions crossed into Spain,

341
00:21:26,522 --> 00:21:29,150
each man carrying his mess kit
full of gazpacho.

342
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,422
<i>Let's move on.</i>

343
00:21:32,494 --> 00:21:37,693
I think we've let enough fresh air
into this incubator picture.

344
00:21:37,766 --> 00:21:40,792
In any case, I wouldn't
want to dwell on it for...

345
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:44,236
- Security reasons.
- Exactly.

346
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:49,173
- You have a question?
- Yes, I do.

347
00:21:49,244 --> 00:21:51,235
Why don't you answer his question?

348
00:21:51,313 --> 00:21:54,510
- Are you two together?
- In all kinds of weather.

349
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:57,347
- Are you reporters?
- We're doctors.

350
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:00,286
With a MASH unit.
The ones that don't have incubators.

351
00:22:00,356 --> 00:22:02,119
Identify yourselves.

352
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:04,921
Captain John Mclntyre, 4077 th MASH.

353
00:22:04,994 --> 00:22:06,928
So am I, except
I'm Captain Pierce.

354
00:22:06,996 --> 00:22:10,056
- Who's your commanding officer?
- We'd rather not say.

355
00:22:10,132 --> 00:22:13,533
He'd like to go through
the war anonymously.

356
00:22:13,602 --> 00:22:15,627
I wonder if you doctors understand...

357
00:22:15,704 --> 00:22:17,934
<i>going through channels,</i>
<i>militarywise-speaking.</i>

358
00:22:18,007 --> 00:22:21,738
Sir, we started with a captain,
went on to a major, then to a colonel.

359
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,176
On the way, we've encountered
oral compulsiveness,

360
00:22:24,246 --> 00:22:26,271
raging paranoia and a colonel...

361
00:22:26,348 --> 00:22:29,112
who's shipping Korea to Switzerland
one dollar at a time.

362
00:22:29,184 --> 00:22:31,118
Which makes you
the next contestant, General.

363
00:22:31,186 --> 00:22:33,450
And the subject you've chosen
is incubators.

364
00:22:33,522 --> 00:22:37,458
- And we need one.
- What about this incubator situation?

365
00:22:37,526 --> 00:22:39,960
- What was the name of that colonel?
- Now just a minute!

366
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:45,228
This is a press conference! The last
thing I want to do is answer questions!

367
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,633
- What exactly is an incubator?
- It grows germs.

368
00:22:48,704 --> 00:22:51,366
General, are we involved
in germ warfare?

369
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,898
- That's a lie!
- [Reporters Shouting]

370
00:23:07,056 --> 00:23:09,149
Holy cow!

371
00:23:09,224 --> 00:23:12,955
Insubordination,
conduct unbecoming officers,

372
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:16,225
violations of Articles 13 through 27...

373
00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:19,825
with a repeat on 26.

374
00:23:19,902 --> 00:23:23,463
Oh, that must be "altering salute
by placing thumb on nose."

375
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:25,598
Henry, there's something
you should know about those charges.

376
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:27,073
Yes. We're guilty.

377
00:23:27,142 --> 00:23:29,940
I'll tell you what else you are:
You're under arrest.

378
00:23:30,012 --> 00:23:32,503
- <i>General's orders.</i>
- Swell. What do we tell the casualties?

379
00:23:32,581 --> 00:23:34,515
We only operate on visiting days?

380
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,517
You gonna lock us up, Sheriff?

381
00:23:36,585 --> 00:23:40,715
If you guy didn't outclass
every bit of surgical talent in Korea,

382
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:43,883
your tails would have been
in handcuffs a long time ago.

383
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:47,588
Henry, it's no crime for doctors
to try to get decent medical equipment.

384
00:23:47,663 --> 00:23:51,724
Did you really yell,
"Give me an incubator or give me death"?

385
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:55,403
Well, it doesn't sound
like anything now.

386
00:23:55,471 --> 00:23:57,439
Yeah. You had to be there.

387
00:23:57,506 --> 00:24:01,033
Now, look, what the general
doesn't understand is,

388
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,203
I can't take you guys out of action.

389
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:05,303
I've got to do something to punish you.

390
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,871
So I'll leave it to you.

391
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,475
Wh-What's a suitable punishment?

392
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:14,289
Why don't you try spending
a lot of time with us, Henry?

393
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:18,315
Maybe that's where we went wrong.
You know how a kid misses his dad.

394
00:24:18,393 --> 00:24:22,420
A marine company has been trying to take
hill 19 again. You guys better suit up.

395
00:24:22,498 --> 00:24:25,797
Let's hope nobody needs
a sample sent to Tokyo.

396
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:31,033
Wow. Did you really call
a one-star general a "NI NCOMPAC"?

397
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:37,910
- Hey, sirs? No, wait, look.
- Not now, Radar.

398
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,345
Ta-da!

399
00:24:40,582 --> 00:24:42,516
- [Laughs]
- Hey!

400
00:24:43,752 --> 00:24:47,848
- Happy germs, sir.
- Radar, how?

401
00:24:47,923 --> 00:24:50,084
A little wheeling and dealing,
a little horse-trading.

402
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,093
A little of this for that.

403
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:54,152
And we went all the way up
to a general.

404
00:24:54,229 --> 00:24:56,163
And a little corporal
shall lead them.

405
00:24:56,231 --> 00:24:58,859
You just gotta learn
to start at the top.

406
00:25:02,304 --> 00:25:07,435
Uh, sir? We do have
just a little bit of a problem here.

407
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:11,502
- What?
- Well, he wants steak for tonight.

408
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,174
- Barbecued.
- So?

409
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:16,581
Can you set this thing for rare?
