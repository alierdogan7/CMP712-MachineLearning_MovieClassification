##

5
00:01:52,887 --> 00:01:54,821
Armies, for the most part,

6
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:58,484
are made up of men drawn
from simple and peaceful lives.

7
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:00,823
In time of war,
they suddenly find themselves...

8
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:03,090
living under conditions
of violence,

9
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:07,100
requiring new rules of conduct
that are in direct contrast...

10
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,103
to the conditions
they lived under as civilians.

11
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:14,938
They learn to accept this
and to perform their duties
as fighting men.

12
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:19,105
But some begin to perform,
as military language puts it,

13
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,617
"at the risk of life,
above and beyond
the call of duty."

14
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:28,622
Military histories are filled
with incredible examples
of individual courage...

15
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:34,287
that are only made more
incredible by the fact that
they were everyday events.

16
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:38,958
As Senior Staff Officer
at Supreme Headquarters
in World War II,

17
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,969
it was my privilege to know
the records of many such men.

18
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:46,302
The story you are
about to see is theirs:

19
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,467
The true story
of the foot soldier,

20
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:52,809
as seen through the eyes
of one of them, Audie L. Murphy.

21
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,146
He received
every decoration for valor
that his country could award,

22
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,813
and he became
the most decorated soldier
for combat action...

23
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:04,255
in the military history
of the United States.

24
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:10,093
<i>In 1937, in northeast Texas,</i>
<i>at the age of 12,</i>

25
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:13,759
<i>Murphy was already</i>
<i>a fair rifleman.</i>

26
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:52,603
I don't suppose you girls have
had time to fill the wood box.
Uh-uh, Audie.

27
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:55,574
Hey, Audie, look at me!

28
00:03:55,643 --> 00:04:00,637
Get off that woodpile,
Preston. Do you want
to break a leg?

29
00:04:00,715 --> 00:04:03,741
Did you get another
rabbit today, Audie?

30
00:04:03,818 --> 00:04:06,252
Yeah.
Now you come with me.

31
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:11,917
You sit down
right over there.

32
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:16,592
You watch that
until I get back, okay?
Okay.

33
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:18,757
It'll keep you
off the woodpile.

34
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,427
Now, you watch it.

35
00:04:21,502 --> 00:04:23,629
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>
<i>[Mrs. Murphy]</i>
<i>Audie.</i>

36
00:04:23,704 --> 00:04:26,195
I saw Mr. Huston today.
He said he'd get
the window fixed.

37
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:30,643
- That's good of him.
- He was askin' about Pa.

38
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:33,441
No word today.

39
00:04:33,514 --> 00:04:37,245
But we'll be hearing
from him real soon.

40

00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:54,130
Hi, Mr. Brooks!
Hi!

43
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,639
[Mrs. Murphy]
Any mail for us today,
Mr. Brooks?

44
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:06,236
Nothing today,
Mrs. Murphy. Sorry.

45
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:10,080
Thank you.
Maybe tomorrow.
Bye.

46
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:15,744
Why does Mom
get so worried
when no mail comes?

47
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:18,087
Because
we got no money.

48
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,266
Here, take these
to the house.
Where are you goin'?

49
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:29,235
I just made my mind up
about something.

50
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:38,601
When he makes up his mind,
he sure does it sudden.
Where is he goin'?

<i>[Sawing]</i>

52
00:05:41,682 --> 00:05:44,742
Hi, Mr. Huston.
Hello, Audie.

53
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:49,279
That was a first-rate job
you did on that chicken coop
the other day.
Thanks.

54
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:51,416
Hi, Mrs. Huston.
Hello, Audie.

55
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:55,792
Sir, I know you don't
hire any steady help
except at picking time,

56
00:05:55,863 --> 00:05:58,195
but could you give me
a full-time job?

57
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:00,530
A full-time job?

58
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:05,402
I wouldn't want much money,
and you could keep half until
we pay back what we owe you.

59
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:10,069
What does your ma say to that?
<i>I wanted to talk to you</i>
<i>before I said anything to her.</i>

60
00:06:10,144 --> 00:06:14,046
It's not right.
Why, you'd have
to quit school.

61
00:06:14,115 --> 00:06:17,107
Yes, ma'am,
but I need the money.

62
00:06:17,184 --> 00:06:21,450
What about your sister
in Farmersville?
Can't she help?
Edna.

63
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:26,926
Corinne's helped all she can,
but, well, she's got a family
of her own to take care of.

64
00:06:26,994 --> 00:06:31,761
A boy your age!
You can't do it, Ben.
This is man's talk.

65
00:06:31,832 --> 00:06:35,427
Will you please
go to the house,
and let me run the farm?

66
00:06:35,503 --> 00:06:39,303
<i>[Rooster Crowing]</i>
Seems like
she's forgot, Audie,

67
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:41,933
I never finished school neither.

68
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:47,106
A couple years older than you,
I quit to go in the Marines
when we was in the big war.

69
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:50,514
<i>Sometimes I wish</i>
<i>I'd stayed in.</i>

70
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:55,613
Probably be retired by now
on more money than I make
out of the farm.

71
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,158
Now about that job...

72
00:07:00,061 --> 00:07:02,757
I guess the best thing to do
is leave it to your ma.

73
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,890
Thanks a lot, Mr. Huston.

74
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:14,904
Ma, I got a full-time job!
I'm gonna work for Mr. Huston
in the morning.

75
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,910
But you've got
to go to school.

76
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,412
I don't care for school.
I don't like it anymore.

77
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,573
You can't stop
your education now.

78
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,913
I'll learn, Ma.
I'll read books.

79
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,921
We can't go on without money.
We can manage
a little longer.

80
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,253
Your daddy's doing
the best he can,
and we can wait...

81
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:35,762
We can't keep waitin'
for some old letter that
maybe won't ever get here.

82
00:07:42,803 --> 00:07:47,604
- What's the matter, Mom?
- Nothing, dear.

83
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,109
Audie and I were just
talking things over.

84
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:53,613
<i>[Boy]</i>
<i>Something bad?</i>
Of course not.

85
00:07:56,684 --> 00:08:00,450
We just decided who the head
of the family is.

86
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:25,908
It's your turn.
I did them
yesterday!

87
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,073
You did not!
Gene keeps saying...

88
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:32,085
Shh!
Gene keeps saying it's my turn
to do the dishes today.

89
00:08:32,153 --> 00:08:34,087
Who did them yesterday?

90
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:36,749
I forget.

00:08:36,824 --> 00:08:40,726
<i>[Sister]</i>
<i>Beatrice and I did them,</i>
<i>and he knows it.</i>

92

and you won't forget
tomorrow.

your hands could use
a little soap and water.

I told you so.

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,048
Time for breakfast, Mom.
Oh, thank you.

96
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:10,215
All the kids are home
from Sunday school.

97
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,555
They can do
everything that needs
to be done today,

98
00:09:12,626 --> 00:09:15,390
so don't you try
to get up.
Yes, sir.

99
00:09:15,463 --> 00:09:19,399
I'm gonna take a run
over to Mr. Huston's.
But this is Sunday.

100
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:23,733
This is not about work.
Jim, their nephew, is
on leave from the Marines,

101
00:09:23,804 --> 00:09:27,069
I haven't seen him
since he went in.
Oh, I see.

102
00:09:27,141 --> 00:09:30,907

<i>The attack was without warning,</i>

<i>and launched</i>
<i>from aircraft carriers</i>
<i>standing off Hawaii.</i>

107

Casualties among naval personnel

sustained a direct hit.

War is gonna last longer
than most of us figured.

Doc, is she...

131
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:13,279
She went peacefully.

132
00:11:14,849 --> 00:11:17,283
I should have
been with her.

133
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:19,444
She didn't know, Audie.

134
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,184
She was happy and proud
of you and her family,

If you don't let

Social Welfare

I can take care of'em now.

All right...
if that's the way it has to be.

As soon as I can,
I'm gonna get them out.

144
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:14,106
I know this must seem like
the end of the world, Audie,

145
00:12:14,174 --> 00:12:16,608
after taking care
of your family
all these years,

146
00:12:16,677 --> 00:12:19,441
but look at it another way.

147
00:12:19,513 --> 00:12:22,607
You've got
no responsibilities left now,
except to yourself.

148
00:12:22,683 --> 00:12:24,776
It's time
you were thinking
about your future.

149
00:12:24,852 --> 00:12:29,516
I have been. That's what
I wanted to tell you.

150
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,616
After all the talk you and I
had about it, I've decided
to go into the service.

151
00:12:32,693 --> 00:12:34,786
I was hoping
you'd say that.

152
00:12:34,862 --> 00:12:37,956
It'll be a great chance
for you to catch up
on your education.

153
00:12:38,032 --> 00:12:43,493
Yeah. The only thing is,
I hate running out on the kids.
They've had enough of that.

154
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:48,337
You can do more for 'em
with your service pay than
you can by staying here.

155
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:51,867
I guess I hadn't
thought of it that way.

156
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:55,848
Course, being under age,
you'll have to get
a letter of permission.

157
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:59,647
I'll get Corinne
to write one for me.

158
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,746
Good-bye, Mr. Huston.

we'll hit the Italian mainland.

That's when this war
gets real personal with me...

337
00:25:38,011 --> 00:25:40,639
because I'll be liberating
my ancestral home.

338
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:44,241
Home? Weren't you
born in Flatbush?
Sure, I was.

339
00:25:44,317 --> 00:25:48,151
But my mother was born
in Naples. I promised her
I'd look up the family.

340
00:25:48,221 --> 00:25:52,021
If I get there in one piece,
I'll bet they'll greet me
like a conquering hero.

What do you mean?

962
01:18:58,975 --> 01:19:04,106
Education, for one thing.
Another is I'd have to transfer
from the outfit.

That's the rule in this

Something about not wanting
to take responsibility.

He's mixed up because,
instinctively, he does
take it all the time.

is he doesn't want
