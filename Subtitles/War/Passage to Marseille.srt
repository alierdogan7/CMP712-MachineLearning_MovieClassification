1
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,047
Navigator to pilot.
5 minutes to target area.

2
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:24,770
<i>Achtung!

3
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,572
[Speaking German]

4
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,137
[Firing machine gun]

5
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:23,958
Bombs away, sir.

6
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,015
Here's another load,
you...

7
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,269
bombs all away, sir.

8
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,067
Good work, men.
Let's get out of here.

9
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,949
Hey, Matrac...

10
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,532
we are approaching
the town of Romilly.

11
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,787
Thank you.

12
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:16,681
Mama.

13
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:17,883
Yes, darling?

14
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,389
Is it dad?

15
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,767
[Whispering] I'm not sure.
You be quiet, darling.

16
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,065
Mother will be
right back.

17
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,232
All right.

18
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,755
Pilot to bombardier.
Open bomb bay doors.

19
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,779
Oh, jean, darling...

20
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,405
until we meet again.

21
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,874
You were to have gone with the
wing commander, Mr. Manning,

22
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,586
But I happen to be rejoining my outfit
not far from your own destination,

23
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,388
So they asked me to bring
you down from London.

24
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,590
And what is my destin...
Your what, sir?

25
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,393
Oh, nothing. I was about to
ask what is my destination.

26
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,970
A military secret,
no doubt.

27
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,145
Sorry, sir.

28
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,196
I'm lost,
and I admit it.

29
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,198
Haven't the slightest
idea where we are.

30
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,404
Not a signpost,
not a marked road.

31
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,207
Somewhere near the channel,
unless I miss my guess.

32
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,001
Even for
a war correspondent,

33
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,828
This is pretty darn
mysterious.

34
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,003
Interesting, though.

35
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,133
Here we are, sir.

36
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,463
Really?
Yes, sir.

37
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,806
We're at an airdrome?

38
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,351
<i>Yes, sir. The base of the
famous squad Victoire.

39
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,849
I can't believe it.
Where are the barracks,

40
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,100
The wind sleeves,
the tarmac runs?

41
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,932
How do they operate here?

42
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,939
Surprising, isn't it? The
French make out quite nicely.

43
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:36,022
They're an intensely
practical people, sir.

44
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,424
Will you get out, sir? Right.

45
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,502
This is headquarters.
I'll stow your bag, sir.

46
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,883
Thank you. You mind
if I take a look?

47
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,430
Not at all, sir.

48
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,052
Well. I must say,
I'm surprised.

49
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,184
This is something new in my
experience of military airdromes.

50
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,186
To think that all these
incredible bombings

51
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,609
Come from a quiet
place like this.

52
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,607
I suppose those cows
are squadron mascots.

53
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,189
Yes, sir. They've brought
us any amount of luck.

54
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,820
They're English, of course,
merely on loan to the Frenchmen,

55
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,824
As they couldn't very well bring
their own cows with them.

56
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,827
Jerseys, sir. The milk is
excellent, if you care for milk.

57
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,033
Seems a strange environment for one of
the deadliest squadrons in the service.

58
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,413
The quiet, you mean?

59
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,416
Yeah. Well, the
French don't mind it.

60
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,418
As a matter of fact,
they rather enjoy it.

61
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,420
It has a way of
livening up a bit

62
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,467
From time to time. And
now, if I may, sir,

63
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,636
I'll take you
to the liaison officer

64
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,713
Between the free French squadron
and our own... Captain Fresene.

65
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,515
[Knock on door]

66
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,841
Come in.

67
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,602
Glad to see you,
Hastings.

68
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,359
I've brought Mr. Manning. Mr.
Manning, captain Fresene.

69
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,984
You're very welcome,
Mr. Manning.

70
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,111
Thank you.

71
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,532
Well, I... I'll leave you in
each other's good hands.

72
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,955
But you must stay to dinner.
There's a place laid for you.

73
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,907
Sorry, sir. Have to push on.
Orders.

74
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,289
Well, good-Bye, sir. I'll have
your bag put in your bunk.

75
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,915
Thank you.
Good night.

76
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,962
Thank you,
Hastings.

77
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,960
<i>Au revoir, captain.

78
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,542
Good luck to you. Would you
like to take your coat off?

79
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,922
I would. Thanks.

80
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,758
Aperitifs will be in.

81
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,136
Or would you
prefer a cocktail?

82
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,559
Oh, no. That's
all right. Thanks.

83
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,510
Sit down.

84
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,971
Thank you.

85
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,146
Captain Fresene, the
purpose of my visit here...

86
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,566
Oh, I know the purpose
of your visit.

87
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,985
Word came this afternoon
from the air ministry.

88
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,155
You've come to see some French traitors,
as monsieur Laval would call us.

89
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,574
No, captain. I've come to
see some free Frenchmen,

90
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,778
To get to know them and to write
about them for my news syndicate.

91
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,954
I think we can do with all the
understanding we can scrape together

92
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,327
In these touchy times.

93
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,829
Well, you can see
a few of us here.

94
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,286
There's certainly
more of them.

95
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,746
Thank you.

96
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,210
Do you think
that marshal Petain

97
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,466
Considers you as traitors
as well as Pierre Laval?

98
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,172
Evidently.

99
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,599
And yet I try
to be charitable

100
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,392
In my judgments,
Mr. Manning.

101
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,595
I try to remember that marshal
Petain's an old man now

102
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,146
And in the hands
of barbarians.

103
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,393
<i>Votre Sante.

104
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,687
You've seen him
these late years?

105
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,899
No, but I did once... Years ago
during the battle of Verdun.

106
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,610
He visited our squadron, which was
then at the foot of the Argonne.

107
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,536
You were flying
in the last war?

108
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,739
Yes. I was a pilot in the
escadrille Lafayette.

109
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,324
Ah, the escadrille
Lafayette!

110
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,206
You must have done your
training with us, Mr. Manning!

111
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,627
Why, we're
old comrades.

112
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,580
Here. Come and
have some dinner.

113
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,382
<i>I, too, was
a pilote de chasse

114
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,425
In squad 26
of the second group.

115
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:48,722
Many times did I see the Indian head
insignia of your squadron on patrol.

116
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,595
Now we meet
for the first time.

117
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,847
<i>Had I known you were an old
pilote of our service,

118
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,644
We would've messed
with the squadron.

119
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,846
Oh, that's all right. Perhaps
I can see them later.

120
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,854
Why, of course.
They're in that room.

121
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,857
Have you noticed?
Not a sound from them.

122
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,438
Remember the old days?

123
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,444
The laughter, the gay
talk in every mess,

124
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,446
Phonograph going full tilt?
Now, poor devils...

125
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,247
well, we're all right, we free Frenchmen,
but we find it hard to be merry.

126
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,073
I understand
they're bombers.

127
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,079
American flying
fortresses.

128
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,253
Though we did begin here 3 years
ago with a few of our own.

129
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,081
They crossed the channel as a unit
the day the armistice was signed.

130
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,916
And you came
with them?

131
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,923
My dear Mr. Manning,
you flatter me.

132
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,471
I'm getting along, and
I'm blind in one eye.

133
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,469
No, no, I'm nothing
but a liaison officer,

134
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,300
And I reached England
by another route.

135
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,602
<i>P.A.'. Groupes a, d, et g,

136
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,055
<i>Rassemblement
au poste du commandement.

137
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,891
<i>Groupes a, d, et g,

138
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,898
<i>Rassemblement
au poste du commandement.

139
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,024
<i>Jecoute.

140
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,695
They're going
out now,

141
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,277
Just to remind the
borsch of our existence.

142
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,494
Soon as we've finished, I'll take you
down to the hangars, if you like.

143
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,292
Thanks. I'd like to
very much.

144
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,854
Mind the step.

145
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,896
Just over the rise
and you can see them.

146
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,448
Great heavens.
What is this?

147
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,954
Planes being pulled
out of barns?

148
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,283
A haystack
for a control tower?

149
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,538
Is this the same place
I saw when I came in?

150
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,960
Do you doubt it?

151
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,959
The hedges are gone,
the trees are gone,

152
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,506
And the fields
have become runways.

153
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,299
I don't doubt that. That's simple.
It's just magic.

154
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,218
But there's one thing I can't understand.
What's that?

155
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,545
Where are the cows?

156
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,176
They've taken them
in the hangars.

157
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,382
They lead the cows in and
lead the planes out. Come on.

158
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,042
They're going as the spearhead
of the attack tonight.

159
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,041
They're going to light up
a target for the others.

160
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,043
Do they know it,
that they'll take

161
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,544
The murderous part
of the pounding?

162
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,965
They'll give some
in their turn.

163
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,464
When I think of what they have to meet
in the air and from the ground...

164
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,463
we can be glad we were
flying 20-Odd years ago.

165
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:36,548
Yeah.

166
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,193
Will you excuse me
a moment, please?

167
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,369
Of course.

168
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,160
Again?

169
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,246
Yes. Tonight's
a special occasion,

170
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,047
Sort of
an anniversary.

171
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,875
I understand.

172
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,676
You have
my permission.

173
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,672
Good luck.

174
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,220
Thank you, sir.

175
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,082
P.A.: All aircraft,
proceed to takeoff positions.

176
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:51,665
All aircraft, proceed
to takeoff positions.

177
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:52,749
Over.

178
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,987
"V" for victor. "V."

179
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,565
You may take off.

180
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,743
"V" for victor. "V."
You may take off.

181
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,515
"N" for Norman.
Take off. Good hunting.

182
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,118
There. Now we can breathe
easy for a few hours,

183
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,328
Have a smoke.
As for them...

184
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,710
what's the destination tonight,
or is that a military secret?

185
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,167
Now they're in the air, it's not.
Berlin again.

186
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,752
Good. How many?

187
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,553
Over 2,000 bombers over
the target tonight.

188
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,972
2,000.
Great heavens.

189
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,719
Matrac
will like that.

190
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,194
I've been thinking
about those men,

191
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,571
Those grim, determined faces...
especially that gunner,

192
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,994
The man you spoke to
just before the takeoff.

193
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,992
I can't get him
out of my mind.

194
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,119
I feel I've seen him
somewhere before.

195
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,950
Matrac.
He impressed you.

196
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,833
I've never seen a stronger
face or a stranger one.

197
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,834
Not a fellow to take liberties
with, I should say.

198
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,712
No. I could tell you a story about
him I've never told anyone.

199
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,543
Would you care
to hear it?

200
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,718
By all means,
captain.

201
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,887
For the moment,
I'll have to ask you

202
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,886
To keep it off the record,
as you journalists say.

203
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,468
It's for your private ear. Later,
I think, it might be told.

204
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,601
This is the story of a little
group of whom Matrac was one.

205
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,024
For many years, they suffered
every pain, humiliation,

206
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,103
And indignity that men can
have heaped upon him.

207
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,029
I chanced to meet these...

208
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,231
Well, we'll let that
come in its place.

209
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,035
To begin, I'll have to take
you far away from here.

210
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,034
The outbreak of the war brought
orders for my return to France

211
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,582
From service
in new Caledonia.

212
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,036
I was forced to take passage
on the Ville de Nancy,

213
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,918
Bound for Marseille with
a cargo of nickel ore.

214
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,672
<i>The Ville de Nancy was one
of those venerable tramps

215
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,004
Which wallow across the
backwaters of the world

216
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,634
Year after year.

217
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,888
She wore the customary coat
of rust-Streaked black paint.

218
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,641
We had a good Breton
skipper... Captain Marlowe...

219
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,064
<i>Who knew his way
around the 7 seas

220
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,642
As a blind man knows
his own room.

221
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,444
Also 2 decent mates
who idolized their captain.

222
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,235
The companionship
of such men

223
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,571
Did much to keep the tedium
of the long, slow voyage

224
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,031
From being too oppressive.

225
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,836
And sometimes, there were songs
of home from the forecastle.

226
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,720
Our crew was made up of
hard-Bitten, salty old-Timers,

227
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,093
Who may have been
no better than they should be,

228
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,970
But were French
to a man.

229
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,767
For stokers
and coal passers,

230
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,096
We had the scum
of the earth...

231
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,681
Mongrel dregs from every
port in the tropics,

232
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,268
Dominated by a chief engineer
cut to the same pattern.

233
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,199
As there were
but 3 cabin passengers,

234
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,869
We all messed
at the captain's table.

235
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,197
The seat of honor
was filled... very amply...

236
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,703
by a major Duval
of the infantrie coloniale.

237
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,706
He was a dominating,
narrow-Minded martinet,

238
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,129
Who had proved his courage
in the last war

239
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,752
And had learned
nothing since.

240
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,176
With him was his aide,
lieutenant Lenois.

241
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,595
He hung on Duval's
every word,

242
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,342
A typical yes-Man.

243
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,719
These...

244
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,266
The first and second mates

245
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,265
And the chief engineer...
Made up our official family.

246
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,143
Oh, yes.
There was one other...

247
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,725
A treacherous youth,
Jordan by name,

248
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,561
Who proved to be
the wireless officer.

249
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,363
Latest bulletin, sir.

250
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,568
"A day of comparative quiet was
enjoyed on the Maginot line.

251
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,028
"From the German fortification
across the river,

252
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,955
"The Nazi radio broadcast an
appeal to the French soldiers

253
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,830
"To lay down their arms
and refuse to spill their blood

254
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,753
"In a useless fight
for the decadent democracies.

255
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,877
"Some martial music was also
broadcast by the Nazis,

256
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,549
"And the loyal
French soldiers

257
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,127
Are understood
to have booed. "

258
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,133
What kind of a war
is this?

259
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,715
Soldiers say "boo"?
Soldiers of France?

260
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,721
I'm a soldier. I fight.
Do I say "boo"?

261
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,723
I can... Listening to music.
Is this war?

262
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,725
I can... Or is it a band concert?

263
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,306
Kindly allow the
commandant to speak.

264
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,857
I beg
your pardon.

265
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,731
I can tell you
what kind of a war.

266
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,982
The Germans are afraid. They're
afraid of our Maginot line.

267
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,487
<i>Brilliant, mon commandant. The
whole truth in a nutshell.

268
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,694
That's right. They know that no power
on earth can break through it.

269
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,451
What are we going to do,
sit there indefinitely?

270
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,032
Yes. We'll sit there
indefinitely,

271
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,241
And even longer, if
that is necessary.

272
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,043
That is what soldiers are
for... To hold the line.

273
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,041
I say the Maginot
line is invincible.

274
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,373
I say the Ziegfried
line is invincible.

275
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,130
And what is that but stalemate?
Where does it get us?

276
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,302
Fresene, I think
I'm going to like you.

277
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,423
Victory comes with endurance.
It came the last time,

278
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,431
And it'll come again to the army
that outlasts its opponent,

279
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,013
To the army that holds its
lines 5 minutes longer.

280
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,848
And that army will
be the French army

281
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,024
Because its officers
will make it hold,

282
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,023
Because they'll hold
their men in place

283
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,524
By means of
cast-Iron discipline.

284
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,856
And what if the Maginot
line is outflanked?

285
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:53,034
Forgive me, sir, but I've always
understood that in a democracy,

286
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,362
Even a soldier has
the right to think.

287
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,243
Discipline is more essential than
thought to a combat officer.

288
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,824
An army's not
a debating society.

289
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,455
Thinking is done
for them by experts.

290
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,038
I trust the captain does
not believe himself wiser

291
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,839
Than marshal Petain and
the general staff.

292
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,666
The British have
a general staff,

293
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,717
And it seems
to feel as I do.

294
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,012
Our allies have no such blind
faith in the Maginot line.

295
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,135
That is because
they did not build it.

296
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,807
They're jealous
of French genius.

297
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,384
A nation
of shopkeepers.

298
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,139
They wanted
to sell us the cement.

299
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,972
<i>Very well said,
mon commandant.

300
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,399
Do not mention the British.
The word offends me.

301
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,816
The British
will fight.

302
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,566
Oh, yes, to the last
drop of French blood.

303
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,319
Only last week, the commandant
said exactly the same thing.

304
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,321
Only last month the same
words were invented

305
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,744
In the office of Herr dr.
Goebbels in Berlin.

306
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,322
Are you accusing me
of disloyalty?

307
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,747
Or is it me
you accuse, sir?

308
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,575
Please. Let's not
accuse anyone...

309
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,000
neither
our traveling companions

310
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,794
Nor our allies.

311
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,293
Very well. I accept
your apology.

312
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,295
If you ask for my opinion,
just mark my words.

313
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,297
Time always
proves I'm right.

314
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,922
Fresene:
this was the atmosphere

315
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,725
In which I was destined to make a
voyage halfway around the globe.

316
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,302
By the time
we'd reached panama,

317
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,308
The world we'd known
was falling apart.

318
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,389
The Maginot line
was outflanked.

319
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,317
The invincible French army
was on the run.

320
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,895
Events were happening
with alarming swiftness.

321
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,980
"Maginot line
flanked. "

322
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,736
It's the fault of our allies!
British civilians.

323
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,533
What did I tell you?

324
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,111
They let our line
get flanked.

325
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,912
France can curse
the day

326
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,615
She let herself get mixed
up with foreign alliances.

327
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:23,699
Sir?

328
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:24,784
No!

329
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,705
Fresene: passing through
the panama canal,

330
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,963
<i>The Ville de Nancy
set her helm for Marseille.

331
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,637
2 days out of colon, the
wireless buzzed continuously.

332
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,967
The air was full of the news of
torpedoings and hostile raiders.

333
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,237
Ahoy! The bridge!

334
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,563
Submarine!

335
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,024
Where away?

336
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,485
20 degrees
starboard, sir!

337
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,035
Sound the alarm.

338
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,656
[Bell rings]

339
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,958
What do you see?

340
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,587
Some sort of suspicious craft.
Can't be sure.

341
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,509
Man the guns.
Aye, aye, sir.

342
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,548
Hold the fire.
Aye, sir.

343
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,973
They'll have a torpedo
in our belly any minute!

344
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,676
Hold
your fire!

345
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,227
Hold your fire!

346
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,189
Well?

347
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,821
It's no sub.

348
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,570
Well, it's a craft of some
sort, isn't it? A boat?

349
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,196
Or a canoe.

350
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:41,823
See there!

351
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,620
That's a man.

352
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,286
He's alive.

353
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,959
Probably survivors
from some torpedoed ship.

354
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:50,836
Hard starboard.

355
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:51,832
Hard starboard.

356
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,163
Man:
hard starboard.

357
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,424
Steady.

358
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,180
Stop.

359
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,476
Lower a boat.

360
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,060
Lower away!

361
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,126
Faster! Faster!

362
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,088
Lower away.

363
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,255
Ho.

364
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,263
Easy with them, men!

365
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,237
Pretty far gone.

366
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,386
<i>God bless you.
Merci.

367
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,960
I needed that.

368
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,336
We've been without food
for 20 days.

369
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,594
Without water for 5.

370
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,092
Then I won't plague you
with questions right now.

371
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:52,851
Put these men
in the aft house.

372
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,554
Set up
the extra cots.

373
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:55,479
Aye, sir.

374
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,976
Hurry.
Right away.

375
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,433
Open up
that door.

376
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,436
Come on.

377
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,563
Easy,
now.

378
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,190
Tell them to
bring them some broth.

379
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,987
Then let them sleep. And
you might ask the men

380
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,405
If they can spare them
some clothes.

381
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,608
Aye, sir.

382
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,863
Come on.

383
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,365
[Bell clangs twice]

384
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,013
Captain Marlowe, what is your
opinion of these fellows?

385
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,012
Are they French?

386
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:35,470
One of them is at least, but what would
they be doing in an Indian canoe?

387
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,894
They are not seamen.
That's plain.

388
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,598
If we were off
the African coast,

389
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,399
I'd wager 10 to 1 that
they were deserters

390
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,146
From one of our
disciplinary battalions.

391
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,978
Don't you say so,
major?

392
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,563
No, I do not. Since we are
not off the African coast,

393
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,944
You're reasoning lacks
something of being brilliant.

394
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,900
Learn to examine the facts,
man. Use your eyes.

395
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,703
Captain Fresene, perhaps
you can do better.

396
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,873
If you want the facts, you'd better
let the men explain for themselves.

397
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,292
I will and hear
a pack of lies.

398
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:01,371
Condemn them without a hearing.
Isn't that unfair?

399
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,672
No, it is not unfair because
I know who they are.

400
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,465
You mean,
you've seen them before?

401
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,589
No, I never saw them
before this morning,

402
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,546
But that is immaterial since I have
certain modest deductive powers.

403
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,176
Lenois was
on the right track,

404
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,758
Though he lacked the
logic to carry through.

405
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,468
These fellows have the
convict look about them.

406
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,678
Some of them may have served in
the disciplinary battalions,

407
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,058
But not recently.

408
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:21,516
Gentlemen, beyond
a shadow of a doubt,

409
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,145
They are fugitives
from devil's island.

410
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,351
From cayenne?

411
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,652
Impossible.

412
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:28,322
We are at least
1,500 miles from cayenne.

413
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:29,865
You mean to tell me they
have made such a voyage

414
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,533
In that small open canoe?

415
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,407
You don't know these fellows,
Marlowe... The type, I mean.

416
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,784
I was stationed in cayenne
a dozen years ago.

417
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,707
I learned the smell
of the convict.

418
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,580
A more depraved and
desperate set of scoundrels

419
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,751
Cannot be found.

420
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,374
No matter what your opinion,

421
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,332
I suggest we hear what they
have to say for themselves.

422
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,087
As you wish.

423
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,215
I shall be amused at their
lies and by exposing them.

424
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,295
We'll see, gentlemen.

425
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,470
Thank you.

426
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,599
Good evening.

427
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,271
Good evening, sir.

428
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,973
Come to attention,
you men.

429
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,410
You, too.

430
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,204
Haven't you been taught to stand
in the presence of officials?

431
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,365
No.

432
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:23,828
Never mind. This is a free ship
and not an armed compound.

433
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,583
I think we can all be seated.

434
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:29,337
Thank you, sir.

435
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:35,635
Well, you men seem to be
a long way from home.

436
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:39,927
<i>Oui, mon capitaine.

437
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,388
You're French,
the lot of you?

438
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:43,438
Yes, sir.

439
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,391
What's your name?

440
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,855
Renault.

441
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,607
Perhaps these men
will now tell us

442
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,687
Who they are and
where they come from.

443
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,777
Willingly, sir.

444
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,579
They are gold miners
from Venezuela.

445
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,781
3 of us that were
born in France

446
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,367
Are naturalized
Venezuelans.

447
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,954
The other two were born in
Venezuela of French parentage.

448
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,789
I see. Where?

449
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:12,126
Well, we were working
a placer claim,

450
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:15,508
300 miles up a branch
of the Orinoco.

451
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,806
Doubtless you've never
been there, sir.

452
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,132
It's deep
in the jungle.

453
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:23,016
You reach it
only by canoe.

454
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,972
We heard of the war
only 2 months ago.

455
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,682
Must be a wilderness that place.

456
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,267
Oh, yes, sir.
It's terrible.

457
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,149
There's no, uh, no
radio, no settlement,

458
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:33,606
No civilization
within 100 miles.

459
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,282
How did the news
reach you?

460
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,359
Just by chance, captain.

461
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,571
You see, there are Indian rubber
gatherers in that region.

462
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,907
Well, 3 of them just
coming in from the coast

463
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,789
Stopped at our camp.
Remember?

464
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,336
Uh-Huh.

465
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:50,210
Well, so, uh, we bought a
few supplies from them,

466
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:53,668
Among other things an ax wrapped
in a Caracas newspaper.

467
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:54,876
Oh, many months old.

468
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:55,802
What paper was that?

469
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:58,756
<i>The Caracas diario.

470
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:02,764
I even remember the
date, November 3rd.

471
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,266
The first news
of the war we heard

472
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,349
Told us of a raid from the
Maginot line in Alsace.

473
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,356
And you were interested.

474
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,191
Naturally, sir. We are Frenchmen
just like yourselves.

475
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:18,867
We wanted to go home
and fight.

476
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:23,538
Likely. You,
what's your name?

477
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,207
Matrac.

478
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,660
Obviously, you are the leader.
Suppose you tell us.

479
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:31,584
I'll speak
for my friend.

480
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,085
Speak when you're spoken to.

481
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,883
Huh? Sit down. Sit down.

482
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,926
Well, go on.

483
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:41,132
We have no leader, we're all equal.
We're a group of free men.

484
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,560
You. You wish
to speak to us now.

485
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,434
Thank you, sir.

486
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,106
You were incredulous over our
attempt to return to France,

487
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,184
And I don't wonder.

488
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,190
Because it was an adventure

489
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,113
That only the deepest feelings
of patriotism could inspire.

490
00:30:57,314 --> 00:31:00,067
All we had, sir,
was our little canoe.

491
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,994
Together with 200 ounces
of gold dust.

492
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,539
Our plan was
to sail westward

493
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,412
To where we could
catch a boat for panama

494
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,334
And from there
to France,

495
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,913
But, uh, we were upset
by a huge swell.

496
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:18,878
And the iron box that contained the
gold and our passports were lost.

497
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,054
We righted the boat
and went on nevertheless.

498
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,098
And from then on,
we were lost.

499
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,427
Helpless.

500
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:30,560
<i>Mon commandant,
my word of honor,

501
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:33,108
All this happened 3 weeks
before you sighted us.

502
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,527
You're one of the
naturalized Venezuelans?

503
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,523
Yes, sir.

504
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,321
Where was
your home there?

505
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:39,774
Silla Bolivar.

506
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,858
You, at the back there.

507
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,489
<i>Como se llama usted?

508
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,821
<i>Jorge Gerou,
a sus ordenes.

509
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:49,829
So, you didn't catch him.
His accent is perfect.

510
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,080
And you have no papers
of any sort.

511
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,332
No proof of identity.

512
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:56,882
No, sir. As Marias
so truthfully told,

513
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,584
They're all at the
bottom of the Orinoco.

514
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,090
I see. All at the bottom
of the Orinoco river.

515
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,090
Yes.

516
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,172
Very good.
Very convenient.

517
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,600
Or is it?
We shall see.

518
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,802
Do you have any further
questions, captain Marlowe?

519
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,731
No, commandant. You've asked quite
enough questions for all of us.

520
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,899
Yes, I think
I've been thorough.

521
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:22,153
Have everything
you need here?

522
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,609
Thank you, captain.

523
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,946
Yes. Captain. You've been
more than good to us.

524
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,155
Fine.

525
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,039
Well, commandant, I'm afraid
they spoiled your evening.

526
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,715
Their stories seem
perfectly plausible

527
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,883
And straightforward
to me.

528
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:44,054
Plausible, sir? It was a structure
of transparent falsehoods.

529
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:46,427
I always trust my instincts,
sir, never what men tell me.

530
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,928
Especially convicts.

531
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,601
All convicts are liars.

532
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,802
The commandant
has said it.

533
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,183
I don't believe a word
of their story.

534
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,684
[Chuckles]

535
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,163
[Whistles]

536
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,088
Captain Marlowe, I've come to a
decision regarding those rogues.

537
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,635
You have?

538
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,212
Yes. In the first place,
you allow too much freedom.

539
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,672
What do you propose
I should do?

540
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,006
Turn them over
to the police, of course,

541
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:30,058
The moment we arrive
in Marseille.

542
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,761
If they're honest men, as you so naively
suppose, they have nothing to fear.

543
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,471
Anything else?

544
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,306
In the meantime, they are to
be locked up in the brig.

545
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,188
Captain Marlowe
as the ranking representative

546
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,813
Of the army of France,
I demand it.

547
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,567
I'm glad you remember
to call me captain.

548
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,320
No one will be locked up on
my ship while I command.

549
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,532
The man's becoming
insufferable.

550
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,204
Fortunately, his word
will not be the final one

551
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,530
When we get to Marseille.

552
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,537
<i>You're absolutely right,
mon commandant.

553
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,209
The man is insufferable.

554
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,583
What's our speed?

555
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:02,132
101/2 knots,
180 revolutions, sir.

556
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,426
Full speed and
195 revolutions.

557
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:05,878
Aye, aye, sir.

558
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:08,259
I want to reach the
danger zone by nightfall.

559
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,467
Full speed,
195 revolutions.

560
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,541
Good evening.

561
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,538
Good evening.

562
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,666
Very fine day.

563
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,248
Any day that takes us closer
to France is a fine day.

564
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:47,086
I wonder... on your
account, I mean.

565
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,092
I was coming here
to tell you...

566
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,218
to warn you men
of something.

567
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,766
Commandant Duval
is of the opinion

568
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:55,264
That you and your friends
have escaped from cayenne.

569
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,264
Some of the others,
too.

570
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:00,724
I wouldn't be fair
if I didn't tell you

571
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,310
That I've come to the
same conclusion myself.

572
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,200
Will you wait here
a moment, please?

573
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,506
Will you come in,
please?

574
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,692
Sit down.

575
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,117
Thank you.

576
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,917
Captain, Renault's
told us what you said,

577
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,464
And we've been talking
here together.

578
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,339
There's nothing to do.
It's true.

579
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,294
We're convicts
escaped from cayenne.

580
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:14,347
Uh, we're Frenchmen. Convicts
or not, we can kill Germans.

581
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,514
What is more important
than that?

582
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,467
Shut up. What do
you know about it?

583
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,350
We're as good Frenchmen as a lot who
have never been sent to cayenne?

584
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,975
We are not soft,
us convicts.

585
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,602
We can kill Germans.

586
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:26,526
Keep out of this, petit.

587
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,229
Why have you told us this,
captain?

588
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,110
To put you
on your guard.

589
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,691
You're for us, then.

590
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,493
Yes.
France needs men.

591
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,038
You see, I told you
he would be for us.

592
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,615
Even if we are
convicts?

593
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:40,915
What does that matter?

594
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:46,417
I guess it's time
you heard our story.

595
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,044
Tell him, Renault.

596
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:52,002
Yes, but what
shall I begin with?

597
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,133
With whom
shall I begin?

598
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,466
Now, petit,
he is from Provence.

599
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:00,052
What caused him
to become a convict?

600
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,683
It was the love of a
farmer for his land.

601
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,264
You are right.

602
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,349
I farmed the land
my father farmed

603
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,435
And his father
before him.

604
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,522
My wife and I planted
as the seasons went by.

605
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,153
And then the government came
and they built a dam.

606
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,906
They flooded all my land.

607
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,828
I guess I went
kind of crazy.

608
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:22,828
He ran to the control station and
attempted to smash the machinery.

609
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,079
When the employees
tried to seize him,

610
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:27,128
He... He maimed several
and killed one.

611
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,672
The government
let me off easy.

612
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:33,127
Instead of being guillotined, I was
transported for life to Guyana.

613
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,837
Do you know
French Guyana?

614
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:40,016
It's the most corrupt and
neglected of all our colonies.

615
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,639
There in the steamy
equatorial climate,

616
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,313
There are 5 or 6,000 men
just like us,

617
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,641
Struggling against
the heavy undergrowth

618
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,647
In the very depths
of the jungle.

619
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:52,479
Slaves, half-Naked
in the forest.

620
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,405
Tortured by heat
and humidity,

621
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,530
Mosquitoes, fever,
rotten food.

622
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:01,580
Men die,
or else go insane.

623
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:12,382
Here you might have found petit
laboring to build a road.

624
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:26,889
I will tell you
about this road.

625
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:30,270
The convicts call it
"road zero"

626
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,694
Because it will
never exist.

627
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,146
Already it has been
under construction

628
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,072
For more than
half a century.

629
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,993
And for that, there is
exactly 16 miles to show.

630
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:44,573
And for those 16 miles, there's
one dead convict for every yard.

631
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:47,580
Not far from where
petit worked,

632
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,536
You might have
run across Gerou.

633
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,748
Working in
a mahogany camp.

634
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:56,051
Formerly a mechanic and a
professional racer of motor cars,

635
00:38:56,251 --> 00:39:00,051
He had killed his sweetheart
during a lovers' quarrel.

636
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,053
In certain circles, it was
considered crude of him

637
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:05,431
To accomplish
this end with an ax.

638
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,743
[Gunshot]

639
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:50,059
Well, of course, since
then Gerou has reformed.

640
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:53,267
He's learned discipline.
Haven't you?

641
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,603
Cayenne is a very
good school for that.

642
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,438
And now, as a
pleasant diversion,

643
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:01,115
May I please
introduce myself.

644
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,444
<i>As you may have already
discovered, mon capitaine,

645
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,325
I'm a very clever
man and sensitive.

646
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,031
Sensitive down
to my fingertips.

647
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,413
In fact, these fingers made me
the best safecracker in Paris

648
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:14,087
And a virtuoso
among the pickpockets.

649
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,255
Oh, they had such
a delicate touch,

650
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,458
And from the purses of the
rich they brought forth

651
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,590
Brilliant symphonies
as from a piano.

652
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,546
Your story is a delightful
diversion, my friend.

653
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,052
<i>Mon capitaine?

654
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:28,430
But one doesn't tell a glib
story with a dry tongue.

655
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,808
You'll find a bottle
of cognac in my cabin.

656
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,312
Thank you. Uh, what
else might I find?

657
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,482
I'll take a chance.

658
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,685
<i>Adieu.

659
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,622
Now, tell me
about yourself.

660
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:55,162
I'm a deserter
of the army of France.

661
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,465
In the last war, at the
age of 16, I enlisted.

662
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:01,839
3 months later,
I ran away.

663
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:05,217
I discovered a terrible
thing about myself.

664
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,549
I was a coward.

665
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,351
Later, I went to morocco to
enlist in the foreign legion

666
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:15,022
In an effort to redeem
myself, but I got arrested.

667
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:19,444
You see, even a deserter and convict
can love his country, captain.

668
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,070
Can you imagine then
my feelings

669
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,776
When during the long years
of my imprisonment,

670
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,613
I had to watch every morning
the tricolor being raised.

671
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:33,826
[Bugle call]

672
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,087
Soon I discovered
that there was another

673
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,548
Who every morning
looked at the flag,

674
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,724
The sight of which
seemed to him like...

675
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,973
Like a benediction,
like a sacrament.

676
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:57,899
I came to feel a strange
kinship with this man.

677
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:03,356
Because every morning, we did the
same thing at the same time.

678
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:07,409
The convicts,
we called him Grand-Pere.

679
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,985
<i>He was a libere',
a free man.

680
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,992
That is, he had served
his sentence,

681
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,494
But was not permitted
to leave the colony.

682
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,209
Since cayenne offers
no employment for free men,

683
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:23,087
The lot of these liberes
was hopeless.

684
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:28,301
But Grand-Pere was more
resourceful than most.

685
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,598
He became a catcher
of butterflies,

686
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,971
For which the Guyanese
are famous.

687
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:36,271
The goods he made from these,
he sold to the tourists,

688
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,894
And the butterflies
themselves to collectors.

689
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:50,235
<i>Thus, franc by franc,
and sous by sous,

690
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:53,196
Grand-Pere was able to put
together a little sum

691
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:57,204
For grand-Pere to plan
and to hope.

692
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,287
The same plan and hope
of all of us...

693
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:01,917
escape.

694
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,464
Hold it, you.

695
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,511
This is a closed road.

696
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,385
We're not guarding
butterflies.

697
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,342
I heard there was a
special big kind up here.

698
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,223
I forgot it was
a toll road.

699
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,521
Hey, these are
cheap cigarettes.

700
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,850
They won't be when you
sell them to the convicts.

701
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,947
Another!

702
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,070
<i>Hi, Grand-Pere.

703
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,321
<i>Bon jour.

704
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:32,994
How is it with you
and your butterflies?

705
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,162
How is it with you
and your mosquitoes?

706
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:36,785
I wish they were
pigs of Germans.

707
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:41,244
What did you say?

708
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,704
Just what I said.

709
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,085
The old man asked you a
civil question, petit.

710
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,172
I said I wish
I was in France

711
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,550
Killing pigs of Germans
instead of mosquitoes.

712
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,974
You mean that you'd fight for
our country if you were free?

713
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,552
Sooner than most,
I swear it.

714
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,559
Not sooner than me.
There is only one thing

715
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,061
I hate more than a guard,
and that's a Nazi.

716
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,233
How about you?

717
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,810
What are you,
a recruiting officer?

718
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,645
Or is this
a cross-Examination?

719
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,653
I'm just asking him.
Well?

720
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:13,531
I'm a patriot, to
answer your question.

721
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:18,831
And my friend over there,
Marias, he's a patriot, too.

722
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:19,953
You see over there
by the guard.

723
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,380
He is very clever. Everything
there is to know about bribery,

724
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,127
Marias knows.

725
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,959
He would be a very useful man
if one were planning an escape.

726
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,547
Maybe.

727
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,410
There is no escape.
Don't talk about it.

728
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,409
It's silly
if you even listen.

729
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,537
The old man just played games
with our mind, that's all.

730
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,869
But I have heard he has money.
Lots of it.

731
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,123
Huh?

732
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:06,875
Well, that's different.

733
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,797
That's something else again,
eh, Marias?

734
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:10,375
That would be
different.

735
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,757
You there.

736
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,464
This fellow got lost
in the swamp.

737
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,766
I told him he could spend
the night with you.

738
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,468
Oh, welcome
to this hotel.

739
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,428
We're crowded
already.

740
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:28,772
Thank you. Thank
you, my friends.

741
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,024
What are you doing here?

742
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:34,699
I paid the sergeant
for your company,

743
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,322
And I brought you
a present.

744
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,745
What is all this talk
about being lost?

745
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:41,619
There had to be
an excuse.

746
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,745
You said you would
fight for France,

747
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:49,001
So she must mean
something to you

748
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:52,425
In spite of your
being here.

749
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:56,505
I thought it would be nice to drink
together and talk about home.

750
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,305
Oh, that's a crazy idea.

751
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:01,055
I think about my
home all the time.

752
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,932
My farm
and my old woman.

753
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:06,184
Yes, a farm is good.

754
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:09,142
There is nothing better
than the good French soil.

755
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,569
Oh, I'd take Paris
any day.

756
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,066
Montmartre
to Moulin Rouge,

757
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,739
And the women.

758
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:16,941
The women.

759
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,527
Paris isn't France.

760
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,658
I like
the open country.

761
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,160
Long, wide roads
and green trees.

762
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:29,371
The most beautiful place
in the world.

763
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,672
For me, France will always
be the great tradition.

764
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:35,001
Versailles,
Joan of Arc,

765
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,507
Statues and
monuments,

766
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:40,511
Napoleon sleeping in
greatness in the invalides,

767
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:44,265
Place Vendome.

768
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,345
A tradition that was too
big for a boy of 16

769
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,477
And was ashamed to
find himself a coward.

770
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:51,651
If it were to cost
my life,

771
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:55,355
It would be a small price
to pay to redeem myself.

772
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:58,066
I would fight and die
gladly to make France free.

773
00:46:58,274 --> 00:46:59,400
Who wouldn't?

774
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,953
I'm past 65,

775
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:07,125
But if I can make sure that
there are 4 Frenchmen at least

776
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,498
Who feel as I do
about our country,

777
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:15,254
Who, if they had the chance,
would fight for France,

778
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:18,211
If I can convince myself
to believe you, I might...

779
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,420
You might what?

780
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,051
I might, even though
I'm an old man,

781
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:25,351
Still find a way
to serve my country.

782
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,304
But tell me again,
if you were in France...

783
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,388
We would fight.

784
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:32,146
But what kind of talk
is this?

785
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,478
We're not in France.
We're in this stinking hole.

786
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,312
What do we do,
grow wings to fly with,

787
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,942
Or do we walk across
the Atlantic?

788
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:39,615
A canoe might be bought.

789
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:43,410
A canoe might float down
the river to the sea.

790
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:44,908
A ship might be boarded...

791
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,364
Listen, old man,
if you're joking with us...

792
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,199
I'm not joking.

793
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:54,209
I want to be sure
that you're the men.

794
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,087
How many have you
talked to before?

795
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,885
Can I take a chance
on you?

796
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:03,010
Are you lying to me?

797
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:05,933
Have you the courage to
beat the river and the sea?

798
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,137
Well, if we haven't,
I know one who has.

799
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:11,313
And if he would be
with us... You know him.

800
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:12,982
His name is Matrac.

801
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,354
Can he get us
through the swamp?

802
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,650
That is
the main thing.

803
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,945
I know the swamp
like my own hand,

804
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,522
But the river
and the sea?

805
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,528
Matrac knows the ocean.

806
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,281
He escaped once
in a canoe to Venezuela,

807
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:25,953
But they sent him back.

808
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,155
But is this man
a patriot?

809
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:29,991
Yes, he is a patriot.

810
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:33,294
A greater patriot than any
of us can ever hope to be.

811
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:37,419
I swear it. He fought the Nazis
long before there was a war.

812
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:42,550
It was in 1938, during
the Munich crisis.

813
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,597
Daladier has just returned
by plane from Munich

814
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:47,971
Where he, a Frenchman,
betrayed France to the enemy.

815
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,677
That's fantastic enough
in all conscience,

816
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,182
But an even more
fantastic thing

817
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,434
Has just happened right
here at the airport.

818
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,605
You getting that?

819
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,149
Go ahead.

820
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,568
Instead of being torn to
pieces by an outraged mob,

821
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,736
The mob welcomed him
home a hero.

822
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,406
It's unbelievable.
From where I'm phoning,

823
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,233
I can see the litter
of flowers on the runway

824
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:05,910
Where the crowd
pelted him.

825
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,078
Not with stones, mind
you, but with flowers.

826
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:09,826
It's incredible,
unbelievable.

827
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,123
Raoul.

828
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,251
Can you print that,
please?

829
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:16,806
Jean, please get out!

830
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,020
Jean! Jean!

831
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,607
Jean, it's no use!

832
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:43,166
Everything I worked for,
smashed to bits.

833
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,216
Did you see them,
the police?

834
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,714
The dirty fascist flunkies.

835
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:48,762
Oh, jean, it may be
hard right now,

836
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,761
But you must remember that
there are still Frenchmen

837
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,137
Who believe in the
things we believe in.

838
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:54,935
They stood there,
just stood there, watching.

839
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,763
Just to make sure
a good job was done.

840
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,600
Darling, you've been
driving yourself too hard.

841
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,731
You need some rest.

842
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:05,063
I know... Romilly.

843
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,524
You said you wanted to
go back there someday.

844
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,527
Romilly?

845
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,279
Yes, remember?

846
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,882
Remember where it
was we first met?

847
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,882
Mm-Hmm. Right over there,
beyond that bend.

848
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:35,100
Here's the very spot.

849
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,975
You were wearing one of those
big, floppy yellow hats

850
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,350
And a basket on your arm.

851
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:42,274
Is that all? Must
have been a warm day.

852
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,772
How long has
it been, jean?

853
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:46,149
Well, when I think
of what's happened,

854
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,026
It seems like a century.

855
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,983
Well, don't think
about it.

856
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,989
You know, you're a lot prettier
now than you were then.

857
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:53,989
Really?

858
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,696
Mm-Hmm.

859
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:58,157
Wonder why we never thought
about getting married?

860
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:01,289
Oh, I've thought of it,
jean, very often.

861
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,335
But I had a rival.

862
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,287
Huh?

863
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:04,417
France.

864
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:07,546
Oh. Well,
that's ancient history.

I'm sorry, monsieur.

If you don't ask,
I won't complain about it.

871

His 2 sons are
both soldiers.

872

Monsieur thinks there
will be another war'?

873

lost the first 3 battles:

The Rhineland, Vienna,
and Munich.

875
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,477
But in
a military way.

876
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,400
Jean, no politics.

877
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,477

No politics.

We said we'd
take someday?

don't you see

pay for riots and killing

948

judges, and juries?

there's still room
for the truth.

truth on a smashed press.

No, but I can
still talk.

America, somewhere...

We can do
something about it.

962
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,227
We can shout the truth

I couldn't
sleep.

972
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:29,047

Yes.

980
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,227
You are under
arrest.

981
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:28,064
For the crime of
inciting a riot

982
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:30,270
And for complicity
in the events

983
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:33,607
Which led to the death
of one Raoul Doulet,

984
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:37,695
And for other traitorous acts
against the republic of France,

985
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:40,531
I sentence you
to 15 years

986
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,958
In the penal colony
of Guyana.

987
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:44,034
Jean!

988
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,711
I'll be waiting.

989
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:52,839
I'll be waiting.

990
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,967
Can you doubt that
this man is a patriot?

991
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:59,846
No. He is
a great patriot.

992
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:03,932
He's the man
to lead us...

993
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,559
but where is he?

994
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:07,391
Where can we
find him?

995
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:08,976
He's in solitary.

996
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:10,811
He will be there
for another 2 months.

997
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:12,362
What was his
offense?

998
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,939
Well, there
was a letter

999
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,570
From someone very
dear to him at home.

1000
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:18,948
One of the guards
made a dirty joke

1001
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,950
And dropped the letter
in the mud...

1002
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,326
so Matrac knifed him.

1003
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,373
2 months.

1004
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,293
Men have gone mad in
the chateau in 2 days.

1005
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:28,791
Not Matrac.

1006
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,339
Marias could get word
to him of our plans.

1007
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:33,962
Sure. And he would be
worth waiting for,

1008
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,135
Even if it
were 2 years.

1009
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,806
Renault:
here on st. Joseph's isle,

1010
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,759
Is a building like
nothing else in the world.

1011
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:46,142
One can go mad
in these pits...

1012
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:48,974
Nothing to see
except blank walls.

1013
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:52,026
Nothing to think about
except escape.

1014
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:56,482
No sound except the beat
of one's own pulse.

1015
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:00,991
Slowly, one's mind... Like one's
body and soul... Gives way.

1016
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,117
Then when this happens,

1017
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:06,245
One is put on the mad side
of the barracks.

1018
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:10,374
Until this happens, one may remain
in the cells of the other half,

1019
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:13,923
Where men are not mad,
but only going mad.

1020
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,798
Here, for long months,
had been Matrac,

1021
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:20,427
The man I had sworn
was a patriot.

1022
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,053
Because of his intense
and fiery nature,

1023
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:26,637
Imprisonment was
especially bitter to Matrac.

1024
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:29,439
But somehow,
slowly and bitterly,

1025
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:32,609
The days of his solitary
confinement went by.

1026
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,232
Jean:
French justice...

1027
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:38,657
beautiful,
decadent France...

1028
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:44,034
Country that gave birth to a bunch
of rotten fascist panderers.

1029
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,830
I hate France.

1030
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:48,033
He's talking to himself
all the time now.

1031
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,084
He'll soon be crazy
like the rest of them.

1032
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,253
Not me, my friend.

1033
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,798
You will pay special attention
to monsieur Matrac.

1034
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:56,215
He's a famous
person,

1035
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,884
Friend of
politicians.

1036
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,086
He has influence,
as you see.

1037
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:03,014
And you're as rotten as
the French that pays you.

1038
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:05,467
If any letters come
for monsieur Matrac,

1039
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,677
You will see they are

could stand the voyage,

right down to it,

01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:55,904
All hands on deck!

1213
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:56,988
[Bell ringing]

1214
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:59,540
All hands on deck!

1215
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,993
All hands on deck!

1216
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,104
Men...

1217
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,561
I have just received
a wireless message

1218
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:31,192
Which is of concern
to all of us.

1219
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:36,114
"June 23rd. France,

1220
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:39,117
"Under the leadership
of marshal Petain

1221
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:41,619
"Has signed an armistice
with Germany.

1222
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:45,670
"According to reports, an emergency
government has been set up in Vichy

1223
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:48,919
"That's negotiating
with the Germans.

1224
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:51,967
"Lt is agreed the Nazis
will occupy the capital

1225
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:57,095
And that Hitler will make a
triumphant entry into Paris. "

1226
01:17:57,298 --> 01:18:01,019
I will not try to express the
common feelings of all of us

1227
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:07,059
On this... blackest day in the
history of our motherland.

1228
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:12,112
As further details
are received,

1229
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:14,156
They will be posted
on the bulletin board.

1230
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:18,656
You will now carry on
with your duties.

1231
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:35,802
I'll take the wheel.

1232
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:36,925
Yes, sir.

1233
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,773
Well?

1234
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:49,145
I'm worried,
captain Fresene.

1235
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:50,727
I want your advice.

1236
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:52,027
About what?

1237
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:54,151
If I follow my orders
and go to Marseille,

1238
01:18:54,355 --> 01:18:56,153
You see what would happen.

1239
01:18:56,357 --> 01:19:00,407
My ship and her cargo would fall into
hands that are friendly to Berlin.

1240
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:02,488
You can imagine how delighted
the Germans would be

1241
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:05,540
With a gift of 6,000 tons
of nickel ore.

1242
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:06,867
Yeah.

1243
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,170
Well, they're not
going to get it

1244
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:11,213
<i>Or the Ville de Nancy,
either.

1245
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:13,415
When the watch changes,

1246
01:19:13,624 --> 01:19:16,468
I'm altering our course
for England.

1247
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:17,591
Fine.

1248
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:20,848
What about Duval?

1249
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:23,426
He's to know nothing
about it.

1250
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:25,181
The new course
will be kept a secret.

1251
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:26,603
My mates will know,
naturally.

1252
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:28,397
They'll be as pleased
as yourself.

1253
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,975
I can count on every one
of the seamen,

1254
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:32,810
But the engine room,
they're not to be trusted,

1255
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:34,395
Least of all the chief.

1256
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:37,447
You know how he
hates the English.

1257
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:39,025
What's your opinion
of the convicts?

1258
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:40,780
If we have trouble,
will they be with us?

1259
01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:41,986
To a man, I think.

1260
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:44,617
To a man, except Matrac,

1261
01:19:44,822 --> 01:19:47,245
And where he leads,
they follow.

1262
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:49,201
Did you see him
when we got the news?

1263
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:51,208
I'm not too sure of him.

1264
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:52,834
I'd stake my life
on him.

1265
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:55,882
I don't know why, but
I feel I know my men.

1266
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,302
At heart, he's a Frenchman...
more than any of them,

1267
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:00,880
More than any of us
perhaps.

1268
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:03,841
I'll have to take
your word for it.

1269
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:05,346
I think you can.

1270
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:13,233
Captain Fresene.

1271
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:29,250
Can I ask you
something, sir?

1272
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:30,872
What is it?

1273
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:32,874
Can you persuade
captain Marlowe

1274
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:34,876
To reach Marseille
at night?

1275
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,047
Marseille?
Why do you ask?

1276
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:37,670
So I can swim ashore.

1277
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:40,469
I don't trust
this major Duval.

1278
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,296
Yes? Why not?

1279
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:43,926
He'll radio the police.

1280
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:45,883
I've been fighting his kind
all my life.

1281
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,513
I know what to expect.

1282
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:49,311
There are many ways to serve
your country, Matrac.

1283
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:51,684
What if you didn't
reach Marseille?

1284
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:53,266
I've got to reach Marseille.

1285
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:55,602
I don't care
about my country.

1286
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:58,278
The France you and I loved
is dead, captain.

1287
01:20:58,479 --> 01:20:59,947
She's been dying
for a long time.

1288
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:02,491
I saw her die in the
Rhineland and in Munich.

1289
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:03,908
Now that her death
is complete,

1290
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,282
I can stop lying
and tell the truth.

1291
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:08,285
I'm trying to
get back to a woman.

1292
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:09,786
I never intended to fight.

1293
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:13,290
I know about Paula and all
that you've suffered,

1294
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:16,794
But the France that you and
I love, Matrac, is at war.

1295
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:20,126
If you won't fight, why
should we help you escape?

1296
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:23,713
I'll leave that
to your conscience.

1297
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:27,676
Your wife is waiting for
the man who went away,

1298
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:29,885
The man who
loved his country...

1299
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:32,347
the patriot.

1300
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,648
Would you betray
such a woman?

1301
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:37,271
I leave that
to your conscience.

1302
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:48,530
Fresene: imperceptibly,
we swung northward,

1303
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:52,332
<i>Marking a course that would take
the Ville de Nancy to England.

1304
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:55,377
But could
the secret be kept?

1305
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,454
On the morning
of June the 26th,

1306
01:21:57,663 --> 01:21:59,461
I was awakened
by the profound silence

1307
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:01,918
Which had settled
over the ship.

1308
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:04,220
I attributed this to the
old cause: engine trouble,

1309
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:08,175
And thought no more about it except to
wonder how long we'd be adrift this time.

1310
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:09,975
Fortunately,
the sea was calm.

1311
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:12,769
I rang for the mess boy.

1312
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:15,974
As yet, I had no suspicion
that anything was wrong.

1313
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:18,980
Then I noticed my pistol was
missing from its holster.

1314
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:38,416
<i>Restez I.

1315
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,462
What the devil
do you mean?

1316
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:40,710
<i>Restez I.

1317
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:41,881
Open this door.

1318
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:43,550
[Rattling]

1319
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:48,213
What's the meaning
of this?

1320
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:49,674
Who locked my door?

1321
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:50,633
I did, sir.

1322
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:51,683
For what reason?

1323
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,010
Commandant Duval's
orders.

1324
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:54,390
You're to come with me.

1325
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:55,812
Where's
captain Marlowe?

1326
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:57,515
You'll see him, sir.

1327
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:08,613
Go on.

1328
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:27,507
Get them down below.

1329
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:35,177
On deck.

1330
01:23:35,385 --> 01:23:36,511
Come on!

1331
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:08,882
What the devil
is the meaning of this?

1332
01:24:09,086 --> 01:24:11,180
Captain Marlowe, I understand
our course has been changed.

1333
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,802
Have you received
new orders?

1334
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:13,928
That's my business, sir.

1335
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:14,858
I've studied your chart.

1336
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:16,344
We're no longer heading
for Marseille.

1337
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:17,553
Correct, sir.

1338
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:19,434
For what reason?
On our present course,

1339
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:21,481
We run the greatest risk of being
picked up by a British destroyer.

1340
01:24:21,682 --> 01:24:23,525
You consider that
such a calamity?

1341
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:25,102
I will consider it a great
misfortune, certainly.

1342
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:27,312
France has no ships
to spare for England.

1343
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:29,273
You would prefer the Germans
to have it perhaps?

1344
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:30,949
I prefer to be a realist.

1345
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:33,072
We've argued these matters
before, captain Marlowe.

1346
01:24:33,277 --> 01:24:36,531
Now we will settle them with the only
argument that means anything: force!

1347
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:39,708
Take him down
with the rest.

1348
01:24:50,711 --> 01:24:54,261
Men, a new order
has been born in Europe.

1349
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:56,512
France has been
given the privilege

1350
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:58,139
Of becoming
a part of it.

1351
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:00,846
The watchword of this
new order is discipline.

1352
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:03,523
From now on, you will navigate
this ship under my command

1353
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,146
Until we
reach Marseille.

1354
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:06,522
This is piracy,
Duval.

1355
01:25:06,727 --> 01:25:08,149
Your action is treason.

1356
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:09,696
I'm willing to let both
questions be decided

1357
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:11,193
By the authorities
at home,

1358
01:25:11,398 --> 01:25:12,820
But I'm
a reasonable man.

1359
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:14,527
If I give you
your liberty,

1360
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:16,078
Will you give me
your word of honor

1361
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:17,200
To take this ship
back to Marseille?

1362
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:18,530
Certainly not!

1363
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:19,740
You may control the ship,

1364
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,666
But you'll never
bring her into port.

1365
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:23,665
No decent seaman
would serve you.

1366
01:25:23,869 --> 01:25:25,792
The men will
do well to consider.

1367
01:25:25,996 --> 01:25:28,840
Those who cooperate will be
given rewards and security

1368
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:30,133
In the new France.

1369
01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:31,756
I speak especially
to you convicts.

1370
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,509
To every man who helps bring
this ship to Marseille,

1371
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:37,216
I promise a full pardon in
favor of the Vichy government.

1372
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:39,142
<i>Vive la France!

1373
01:26:59,089 --> 01:27:00,557
Hold it!

1374
01:27:02,509 --> 01:27:05,763
Take your stations
and prepare to get underway.

1375
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:07,393
Confine the engine room
crew below decks

1376
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:10,441
And see
that they do their work.

1377
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:12,064
Aye, aye, sir.

1378
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:13,441
And no more nonsense.

1379
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:14,441
Stay below.

1380
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:15,568
Aye, there, man.

1381
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:17,194
Get going.

1382
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:18,571
Get below.

1383
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:25,870
Good work, men.

1384
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:28,293
It was a pleasure,

Good.

1388

Obviously, some skulls
are too thick to damage.

1389

Oh, no. We all stuck
by the story

They were survivors
from a torpedoed ship.

I remember
this Matrac now.

1459
01:36:35,832 --> 01:36:38,460
His paper was small, but
every journalist in Europe

1460
01:36:38,668 --> 01:36:40,966
Admired the fight he put up against
appeasement and the Munich sellout.

1461
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:42,262
He still fights.

There are so many questions
on the tip of my tongue.

1465
01:36:49,429 --> 01:36:51,227
Has Paula rejoined
her husband?

1466
01:36:51,431 --> 01:36:53,058
Did he ever see his son?

1467
01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:55,439
Never, but he
visits them often.

1468
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:57,270
But how, if he's
never seen them?

1469
01:36:57,478 --> 01:36:59,446
Well, he visits them
in a strange way.

1470
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:01,240
Often when he's
on a bombing mission,

1471
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:03,114
He drops them a letter in
a weighted steel tube.

1472
01:37:03,318 --> 01:37:04,865
When you
saw him tonight,

1473
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:07,868
He was asking permission to turn
92 degrees south to Romilly

1474
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:09,870
To drop such a letter.

1475
01:37:10,074 --> 01:37:12,543

not actually separated.

All right.

1562
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:31,628
Is it bad to
make a bad wish?

1563
01:41:31,836 --> 01:41:33,634
Yes, Jean.

1564
01:41:33,838 --> 01:41:36,261
Even if it is
about Hitler?

1565
01:41:36,465 --> 01:41:39,560
Well, it's better
if you make a good wish.

1566
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,933
All right, then. I'll make a
wish about daddy. I wish...

1567
01:41:42,138 --> 01:41:43,731
Oh, you mustn't tell me
your wish

1568
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:45,103
Or it won't come true.

1569
01:41:45,308 --> 01:41:47,026
I'll know
what it is anyway.

1570
01:41:47,226 --> 01:41:48,603
Come on. Closer m,

1571
01:41:48,811 --> 01:41:50,609
And blow them as hard
as you can.

1572
01:41:50,813 --> 01:41:51,735
All right.

1573
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:53,323
There.

1574
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:55,618
I did it.

1575
01:41:55,818 --> 01:41:58,446
Now I'll really grow up
to be like daddy.

1576
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:00,827
I'm not supposed to say.

1577
01:42:01,032 --> 01:42:02,500
Oh, well, that's
all right, darling.

1578
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,543
You've got your wish
already anyway.

1579
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:07,088
You're like him
in many ways.

1580
01:42:07,288 --> 01:42:10,462
You have his eyes...

1581
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:13,089
you have his nice hands.

1582
01:42:13,294 --> 01:42:14,671
I hope you
have his heart.

1583
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:17,132
Was it the best heart
in the world?

1584
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:18,637
I'll bet it was.

1585
01:42:18,841 --> 01:42:21,594
Oh, it is a very
good heart, jean,

1586
01:42:21,802 --> 01:42:23,850
A tender heart to be
in such a rugged body.

1587
01:42:24,055 --> 01:42:25,682
You know,
you can thank god

1588
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:27,437
If you grow up
to be like him.

1589
01:42:28,893 --> 01:42:31,521
Can I eat my cake now?

1590
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:34,278
Put your napkin on
like a good boy.

1591
01:42:34,482 --> 01:42:35,699
There.

1592
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:37,277
[Airplane approaches]

1593
01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:38,657
Daddy?

1594
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:41,159
Maybe. Let's look.

1595
01:42:41,364 --> 01:42:43,662
Come on, darling.

1596
01:42:57,296 --> 01:43:00,300
Is it daddy?
Are you sure it's him?

1597
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:02,260
It may be.

1598
01:43:02,468 --> 01:43:03,890
I think it is.

1599
01:43:04,095 --> 01:43:06,894
But he wouldn't miss
today, would he?

1600
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:09,146
Does he know
it's my birthday?

1601
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:10,522
Yes, dear. He knows.

1602
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:13,149
But they've
gone past, mama.

1603
01:43:13,354 --> 01:43:15,527
I don't see anything,
do you?

1604
01:43:15,731 --> 01:43:18,154
No, dear.

1605
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:20,157
He didn't fly over.

1606
01:43:21,696 --> 01:43:23,698
Perhaps it wasn't him.

1607
01:43:30,496 --> 01:43:32,339
Jean.

"V" for victor to fox.

1612
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:50,687
They're coming in.

1613
01:43:50,891 --> 01:43:52,734
2 motors gone.

Limited control.

1615
01:43:54,562 --> 01:43:55,563
Casualties.

1616
01:43:55,771 --> 01:43:57,148
Victor in trouble.

1617
01:43:57,356 --> 01:43:59,734
Stand by, ambulance
and crash truck.

1618
01:44:38,397 --> 01:44:39,569
Hello, Renault.

1619

Stretcher bearers!

1620
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:41,821
Who?

1621
01:44:42,026 --> 01:44:43,448
Lenoir is hit.

1622
01:44:43,652 --> 01:44:45,245
Hurry. He's bleeding
all over the place.

1623
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:46,322
Anyone else?

1624
01:44:46,530 --> 01:44:47,497
Yeah. Matrac.

1626
01:45:12,348 --> 01:45:14,817
He got 2 Messerschmitt.

1627
01:45:15,017 --> 01:45:16,940
He didn't get
the third one.

1628
01:45:35,663 --> 01:45:38,382
It was for
his kid's birthday.

1629
01:45:38,582 --> 01:45:39,959
We couldn't make it.

1630
01:46:29,592 --> 01:46:31,640
My comrades...

1631
01:46:31,844 --> 01:46:34,347
I can think of no more fitting
last words for our friend

1632
01:46:34,555 --> 01:46:37,183
Than those which he himself
wrote as his last words

1633
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:39,143
And wasn't
able to deliver:

1634
01:46:39,351 --> 01:46:41,774
"My dear son,
