Cheer up.
lt could happen to anyone .

362
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,165
Get those things out

First the professors,
then the students.

372
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:21,887
All the Jews will be
in the Polish salt mines soon .

373
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:35,035
Student bo xing champ
and nowhere to go .

374
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,776
You can go to England
instead of me .

375
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,287
How? When?

376
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,954
You'll hear from me .

00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,299
What's John doing here?

379
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:45,432
He's taking my place .

380
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,211
What kind of madness is this?

381
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:53,410
Robby, the Jerries
don't like Jews.

382
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,015
l could've sent Esther.

383
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:59,485
Yes, you could ha ve .

384
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,320
Come on , we can't sta y here .

You seem surprised .

The war is o ver.

412
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,399
- Not for me .

l don't know any of them .

416
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:54,280
Too bad .

419
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:22,470
Up!

420
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:29,183
The English don't send planes
for no reason .

421
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,153
Who or what did the y come for?

422

00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,886
You know nothing , do you?

424
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,402
You're tough , aren't you?

425
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,640
Bo x er's muscles.

00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:55,006
Turn him round .

427
00:46:55,946 --> 00:46:58,972
Do you ha ve muscles

00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:07,914
Enough , Breitner!

429
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:12,728
We don't work like that.
Ha ve you gone mad?

430
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:16,228
My dear bo y, l'm sorry.

Just tell me what you know.

Toda y's affair didn't happen

l wonder who let the cat
out of the bag .

437
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:47,058
The information . . .

from London .

439
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:55,895
Van der Zanden .
Do you know this person?

440
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:58,798
Van der Zanden . . .

441
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:03,475
He's our contact in London .

442
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:05,941
That's not true .

443
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:09,915
lt's an open secret.

444
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,821
lt's all for nothing , anywa y.

445
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:18,050
l suggest you talk.

446
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:21,757
Talk!

447
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:26,300
That's your trick.
Butter up a person . . .

448
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,802
. . . and then beat him .

449
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:30,104

00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,082
Tell me their names!

453
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:15,911

You must be mad .

This is no wa y

- You can't just let him go .

Bait? A lure .

524

Exactly.

525
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:07,460
He might try to get in touch
with the resistance .

526
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:12,407
- Then you'll ha ve new guests.
- We ha ve the space .

l've lost the taste for it.

563
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:09,435
You're scared .

564
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:14,672
We were betra yed by someone

565
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:17,377
- How do you know?
- John told me .

01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,807
And he's in London .

574
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:04,359
Did you see Robby?

575
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:09,563
Then we can open the curtains again .

576
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:11,956
Fine .

577
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:15,136
