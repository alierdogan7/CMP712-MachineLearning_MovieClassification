00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:25,620
March 12, 2012. You're
watching the morning news.

2
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,420
Our domestic report began
with a moving ceremony.

3
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:59,220
Seventy years have passed
since the Second World War

4
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,180
stormed through Macedonia,
taking away many innocent lives,

5
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,460
Including 97 percent of the
Jewish population.

6
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,780
In memory of these victims,
symbolic funeral urns

7
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,460
containing their ashes
were placed yesterday

8
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,860
In the new Holocaust
Memorial Center.

9
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,620
In her message to the
people of Macedonia,

10
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,100
US Secretary of State
Hillary Rodham Clinton

11
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,780
stated that, until recently,
their perished fellow countrymen

12
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,500
were on1y painful memories
- But as of today

13
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:30,700
these urns will be their
eternal grave and monument.

14
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,740
Look who's talking! You're
the spitting image of me, girl.

15
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,140
Prem Rebecca,
Queen of the Promenade,

16
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:49,180
that's what they used to call me!

17
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:23,260
People didn't mix
in those times...

18
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,820
The only way you'd meet one
of his kind was on the streets.

19
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,140
Old Serbia reveals: The Germans
are advancing through France!

20
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:34,060
Churchill appeals to Mussolini to
remain neutral! Fashion Pages:

21
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:38,740
The Claudette Colbert
hairstyle! Buy Old Serbia!

22
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:51,140
A bagel for you, Miss Rebecca?
- Thanks.

23
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,940
You want some more,
you stinking scum?

24
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,740
You son of a whore...

25
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:18,020
It's not half-time yet, striker!
- I believe he's addressing you.

26
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:23,660
Oh, yeah... We're kind of
redecorating. We're decorators.

27
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:27,020
You coming, striker?
- Striker?

28
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,940
A football player. The one
that shoots and scores.

29
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,620
We didn't have an opportunity
to be properly introduced...

30
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,420
Kosta the Count. Enchanted.
And you are?

31
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:41,100
We're nice girls who don't
talk to deadbeats.

32
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:43,220
We're not deadbeats
we're worldly decorators!

33
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:46,300
You coming back or what?
- Your assistant's calling you.

34
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,620
Can't you wait a second?

35
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:53,540
Hey! Why don't you
join me for a coffee?

36
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,580
We shouldn't hold you up,
you've got a busy day.

37
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,420
Good luck with the decorating!

38
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,460
3OOO people, as young and
handsome as ancient gods,

39
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:15,100
carried the torch
from Greece to Germany.

40
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,620
Thousands of athletes
from all over the world...

41
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,620
Thousands of athletes
from all over the world ..

42
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,700
From France, Hungary, Egypt...

43
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,181
from France, Hungary, Egypt
- All of them marched before

44
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:28,140
the Führer in the biggest
stadium you can imagine.

45
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,940
I had the privilege of
being there,

46
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,660
to witness the most magical
spectacle in the world:

47
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,900
The Olympic Games in Berlin!

48
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,940
I wonder who paid for that trip.
- That lousy paper he works for.

49
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:44,380
They sent him as a correspondent.
He's come back like a little Goebbels.

50
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,540
And one day, even footballers!
But not the kind of

51
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,620
footballers who hit the bottle
and fight with the Gendarmes!

52
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,100
Not thugs or savages! Only
true sportsmen and patriots.

53
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:58,220
Come on, Dimitriy! Kosta
promised this was the last time.

54
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,260
Don't you lecture me, Prof!
He screwed it up just in time.

55
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:06,420
You know who we're up
against today?

56
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,900
Serbian Sword.

57
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,540
The almighty Serbian
Sword from Belgrade!

58
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:14,860
Those Serbs will
kick the shit out of us!

59
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:17,420
Shut your trap, Skeptic!
When i said almighty

60
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,540
I didn't mean invincible.
- But they are well fed.

61
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:23,420
And they've got brand new
jerseys, those pansies!

62
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,700
So you should at least
show some self-respect!

63
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,221
Their gendarmes call you yokels.
Their teachers force you

64
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,820
to speak their language.
Their soldiers have taken over

65
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:33,540
your county. And now they
even want to erase its name.

66
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,580
Let me hear you, lads!
What's the name of our country?

67
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,020
Macedonia!

68
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:39,540
And what's the name
of our team?

69
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,180
Macedonia!

70
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:45,660
It's a holy name, damn it!
Ty not to dishonor it.

71
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,540
Buzz off, Gypsy!

72
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,740
Nice speech you gave
them, Dimitriy.

73
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,100
I've had it up to here with
provincial amateurs.

74
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,940
Smart thinking!
- One day football will be

75
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:08,620
the most popular sport in Europe,
and these mutts will be ready

76
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,261
for that day, dead or alive.
Keep to the left! The left!

77
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,260
Skeptic! Have you got
two left feet?!

78
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,860
Watch out, Cesar!

79
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:27,740
Block him, Gooh! - Block
him yourself, you schmuck!

80
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:33,740
One-nil...

81
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,380
hopefully they won't notch
up more than three goals.

82
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:06,580
"Slavia 2, Olympia 1.
Concordia 2, Citizen 2..."

83
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,340
Here we are: "Serbian Sword 6,
Macedonia nil." - Read it out!

84
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,780
"Once again the home team's
defense only briefly endured

85
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,740
the visitors' attacks. This was a
classic example of how enthusiasm

86
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:22,260
can never be sufficient against
the skill and knowledge

87
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,700
of an obviously better and
more experienced team."

88
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,300
Here we go! One bowl of soup
for each three of you.

89
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,700
Any meat in here?

90
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:33,940
I only buy meat when
you win, Skeptic.

91
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,620
So that's why i can't remember
the last time i ate any.

92
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,140
Our respect, Mr Pavlovich!
Respect and deep condolences.

93
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:43,580
His name is Pavlov,
not Pavlovich.

94
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,420
You don't even know your own
father's name, you bastard!

95
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,100
Eat up your soup, kid!

96
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,220
Wasn't it you who was preaching
about self-respect, Dimitriy?

97
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,420
Well you haven't achieved
much to be proud of so far.

98
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:03,300
Which is why i have an
announcement to make.

99
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:07,260
We will soon have the services
of a professional coach.

100
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,380
I've personally invited
Mr Spib to join our team.

101
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,140
Who's Spik? - Rudolph Spitz,
the former Prussian striker.

102
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,100
A German?

103
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,100
Not only a German, Manga,
but a Berliner.

104
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:22,780
A real gentleman. Used to be one
of the best players in Europe.

105
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,060
A Kraut! - i'm not talking
politics with you, Afrika!

106
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,420
It's not about politics, Dimitriy.
Folks are afraid of the Krauts.

107
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,420
Football is the proletariat game.
You can't bring a Nazi into it!

108
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:35,420
And who said he was a Nazi?
- Comrade Lenin said...

109
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:38,300
Well fuck both you and
your buddy Lenin!

110
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,020
It's me who formed this club
and I'll run it the way i want,

111
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:47,380
whether Lenin likes it or not!

112
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,420
Hold this for me!

113
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,580
Where are you going?
This discussion isn't over yet!

114
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,860
They say all the prem Parisian girls
are wearing yellow this season.

115
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:02,780
They say all the pretty Parisian girls
are wearing yellow this season.

116
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,540
Kosta the Count. Remember me?

117
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,620
Now I recall. The decorator.

118
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:13,500
You never told me your name.

119
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:15,500
Rebecca!

120
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:21,380
So, it's Rebecca? Although
I like Ramona better.

121
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:23,500
Like the song, "Ramona"...

122
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,540
Rebecca Cohen!
Did you hear me?

123
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,740
Coming, Dad!

124
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,580
Excuse me.

125
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:38,900
You're late for your
French lessons.

126
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:45,420
I don't like French anyway.
- You'll like what I tell you to like!

127
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,900
Who's that scoundrel, Pepo?

128
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,180
A local street hawker, boss.

129
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:04,660
A Christian?
- A nobody.

130
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:08,460
Don Raphael Cohen, the
richest banker in town.

131
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,300
Nothing personal, but
you stand a better chance

132
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,740
of courting the
Pope's daughter.

133
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:16,140
The Pope doesn't
have a daughter.

134
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:19,180
Try not to be such a
big-head, Skeptic!

135
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:26,140
Paris falls...
What's left? The moon?

136
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,860
Her playing blooms as she
does herself, don't you think?

137
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,340
She's capable.

138
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:54,100
I believe Mendelssohn
never sounded so tender...

139
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,180
It's Beethoven, sir.

140
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,940
What Beethoven?

141
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,420
The German?

142
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:07,140
I believe Beethoven
was Flemish.

143
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:09,820
Rubbish! i'm sure
he was German!

144
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,540
Ludwig VAN Beethoven, sir.

145
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:18,460
Well, in any case, go and
tell her to play Mendelssohn.

146
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:22,660
No dilemmas with him:
He was 100% Jewish.

147
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:34,140
The train's broken down. They're
sending him over on a dressage.

148
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:37,460
On a draisine, you bozo!
- Aright.

149
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:39,500
And now we'll be waiting
here all day!

150
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:45,460
For a reason! We're not waiting
for some Gypsy fortune teller.

151
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,180
We're waiting for Rudolph
Spik, the man who coached

152
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,620
the best teams of Austria,
Czechoslovakia, Poland...

153
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:53,380
All nice countries
crushed by the Kraúts.

154
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,380
Never trust people who eat
pork with marmalade!

155
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,700
Germany is a civilization centuries
ahead of your slow brain, Pancho.

156
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:08,140
You really like them, Dimitriy?
- At least they'll bring order,

157
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:11,980
so the trains won't be
breaking down every minute.

158
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,380
And besides, I like Germans a
hundred times better than these...

159
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:20,340
vultures!

160
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,780
Seems like our guy.
- Let's make an impression!

161
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,260
Mr Pavlov?
- How do you do, Mr Spib?

162
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:45,540
My name is Dimitriyl of the
Macedonia Football Club.

163
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:48,820
And these are our players.

164
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:54,060
Gents! This is our new coach,
Mr Spitz from Germany.

165
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,380
Could someone give me a
hand with this trunk?

166
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,060
But of course!
Goohl! Pancho!

167
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,620
It's always us that get shafted.

168
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,700
This way, Mr Spib.

169
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:13,060
This crap weighs a ton!

170
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,340
Like he's packed the dead
Kaiser himself in here!

171
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,100
I heard that! You'll be sitting on the
bench for the next three matches!

172
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:24,980
Ladies and Gentlemen! King Kong,
the Eight Wonder of the World!

173
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:28,220
A giant ape against
the rest of the humanity!

174
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:32,620
The latest American hit in our town!
Only for people with nerves of steel!

175
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:38,180
That was amazing! I still
don't get how they made it.

176
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,580
It wasn't a real monkey,
it was just a dummy.

177
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:46,460
A giant dummy falling off a
building with a life-size blonde

178
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,860
in his hand? - Come on Jamilia!
All monkeys fall for blondes!

179
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:54,500
What's happened?
- My heel. I think it's broken.

180
00:14:57,419 --> 00:14:59,299
Here they are! Two rolls of
first class leather.

181
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:01,899
Here they are! Two rolls of
first class leather.

182
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,740
We have a deal now?
- What deal?

183
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:08,380
?hat do you mean
"what deal'? Keep one

184
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,260
and use the other one to
make boots for our team.

185
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,740
Don't worry, they're brand new.
- That's exactly what worries me.

186
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,900
What's this?
- What?

187
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:25,980
An Army seal.
- What Army?

188
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:28,580
The Mexican Army!
Don't play dumb with me!

189
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,420
It's the seal of the
Royal Serbian Guard.

190
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,540
Do you know what will happen
to this store if they find stolen

191
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:37,140
military property in here?
- Come on! You could cut off

192
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,180
that piece and make
the boots with the rest.

193
00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:42,420
Cut the crap, Count!
Don't teach me my business!

194
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,420
Keep an eye on the store.

195
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,940
And try not to nick anything!

196
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:01,380
You again?!
- Oh, hello Miss Ramona!

197
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:06,740
Let's go! - Don't make a
fuss! it'll only take a minute.

198
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,300
I'll wait outside. There's no
fresh air in here... Bumpkin!

199
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:15,980
One customer less. What
can i do for the other?

200
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:23,140
I'd like to have my heel repaired.
- Your heel? We're heel experts!

201
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,460
Who made these? it'll take
a bit of time to fix them.

202
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,860
In the meantime, why don't we
go for a coffee? - in that case

203
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,680
I'll come by some other time.
- Well, how about i lend you

204
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,219
another pair of shoes, so you
don't go home barefoot? And I'll

205
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,620
deliver these ones tomorrow.
- That's kind of you, but...

206
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,740
How about these ones?
They're so chic!

207
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,500
Italian stilettos. Very expensive.
- On the house!

208
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,340
Such beautiful stockings
don't belong in slippers.

209
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:10,140
A footballer, a decorator,
a cobbler... What next?

210
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:15,940
Next is why don't you
walk these shoes over

211
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,060
to our stadium sometime?
We practice every afternoon.

212
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,900
Rumor has it you always lose.

213
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,620
You done? - i'm coming
Jamilla! Give me a break'.

214
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:30,220
Hustler!

215
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,940
So when can i pick up my shoes?

216
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,500
I'll bring them to you.
Just say where.

217
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,540
And if I don't say where,
will i get to keep these?

218
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,940
Only if we walk
them together sometime.

219
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,740
To that muddy stadium? is that
the best you can offer a lady?

220
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,380
How about a movie? There's
one with a giant monkey.

221
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,460
It's not a real monkey it's a
dummy. Like a giant doll, get it?

222
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:02,460
Sure. A doll. Just like you.

223
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,500
I stroll down the promenade
every Thursday afternoon.

224
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,060
Praised be Jesus.
- Forever, amen.

225
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:05,340
How are you feeling, Mother?

226
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:12,780
The doctor said you can't
eat solid food anymore,

227
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:16,660
so i've made you a little broth.

228
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,220
We both know i've never
been much of a cook.

229
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,340
I found the recipe
in a newspaper...

230
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,460
What happened with
the newspaper?

231
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,180
What do you mean?

232
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:53,340
They bring us newspapers
every day,

233
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:58,460
but i haven't seen your
column in them for a while.

234
00:19:59,059 --> 00:19:59,059
Oh, that... You know how
they are - I got suspended!

235
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:04,140
Oh, that... You know how
they are - I got suspended!

236
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:08,820
Although I am partly to blame
myself. Missed a few deadlines.

237
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:12,860
You lost your job?
- I didn't lose the job, Mother.

238
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:15,539
I've been suspended
for a month, that's all.

239
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:17,820
With the new coach I hardly
have time to breathe.

240
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,420
Wait till you meet him.
A true German!

241
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:26,420
Your father sweated blood for
sixteen years in American mines

242
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:32,300
to earn money for your studies.
We sacrificed our best years

243
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:37,940
to make you an educated man,
to drag you out of this gutter...

244
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,460
And now you waste it
on that folly!

245
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,460
Football is not a folly,
Mother! it's a princely sport.

246
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,980
A real prince would find himself
a princess, start a family...

247
00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:00,420
Look at you! Living alone
like a dog.

248
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:06,300
Who's going to take care
of you when I die, my son?

249
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:11,340
You don't get it, Mother.
One day, football will become

250
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:14,780
the most important thing
in the world.

251
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:32,620
The freedom of your movement
is limited by rules and regulations.

252
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,260
And then? - And then we went to
the promenade. I bought her a soda.

253
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,780
Eh, soda! - if you break those
rules you create anarchy.

254
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:45,100
So what? i've got no money
for a restaurant.

255
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,460
I promised Father Kiril
no more stealing till Easter.

256
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:50,540
No worries! This guy will have
us all drop dead by Easter!

257
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:53,060
But if you know how
to stretch the rules,

258
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,700
then you make
magic on the pitch!

259
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,100
Faster!

260
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:02,980
Come on, faster!
- Up the tempo, guys! Tempo!

261
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:05,539
Then what? - And then we
talked about our signs...

262
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:08,060
What signs?
- Horoscope signs.

263
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,060
Like, I'm a Sagittarius
and she's a Virgo.

264
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:11,780
But you're not Sagittarius,
you're Cancer.

265
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,180
Yeah, but she said she
preferred Sagittarians.

266
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,220
Modern football is based
on the same principles

267
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:27,100
as the seven Bushido virtues
of the Japanese samurai:

268
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:30,620
loyalty, courage...

269
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,220
And then? - And then I
walked her home.

270
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:37,660
You didn't ty to kiss her?
- No.

271
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,780
You jumped on my cousin
Maria on your first date,

272
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,380
and you didn't even
smooch this one?

273
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:44,700
This one's not that
type of girl.

274
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,420
And what type of a girl
is my cousin Maria?!

275
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:50,940
Persistence and stamina,
not gossiping!

276
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,900
Take a break, Pancho, the
polenta's almost gone cold.

277
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,780
Don't bug me, woman!
I'm being conditioned here!

278
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:01,660
Same thing in our house. i can
never get my son to eat polenta.

279
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,780
That's not my son
that's my husband!

280
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,780
And who's got two
left feet now?

281
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:15,060
Left and right! Keep tying!
Concentration, Pancho!

282
00:23:15,579 --> 00:23:19,540
It's like the tango,
left-kick, right-kick...

283
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:29,700
Write that since I met her
I cannot... - A cliche!

284
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,679
R But it's true!

285
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:33,845
- Doesn't matter it still
sounds like a cliche.

286
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,900
Okay, how would you put it?

287
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,540
I'd start with something
more original, like

288
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:43,020
"Dear Rebecca, thy beauty recalls
those Nicene pillars of yore..."

289
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,820
What's that? - A poem.
- Not that, the pillars?

290
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:50,420
Oy! What are you mo
waiting for? An invitation?

291
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,340
Afrika, what was that
word again?

292
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:56,180
Menu à la cake. That
would definitely impress her.

293
00:23:56,859 --> 00:23:58,819
But only if you pronounce
it with a French accent.

294
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:00,820
And the other one?
- Vors d'evar.

295
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:04,140
That's the drink? - No, you
moron! That's the food.

296
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:08,020
The drink is after it if.
- After it if, after it if...

297
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:13,340
If he gets used to five balls,
he'll easily handle a single one!

298
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,180
Just like the Krauts bombing
London: five bombs per building!

299
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,060
Our next game is against Hajduk.

300
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:28,700
It's quite a challenge. Hajduk
are Croatia's best team.

301
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:31,740
She's agreed to come to
a soiree on Tuesday.

302
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:36,220
But I need a suit.
- I don't have any. Ask Manga.

303
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:39,580
It'll be our first game together.

304
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,220
Manga, can you lend me a suit
for Tuesday? - Gambling again?

305
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:47,260
No, i need it for something
else. - For what?

306
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,060
I think i've fallen in love.

307
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,220
So I'll say only...

308
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,980
I locked it!

309
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,700
What's this?

310
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:52,260
You've grown!

311
00:25:55,339 --> 00:26:01,620
When your mother brought
you into this world,

312
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:07,700
your feet were so tiny they
could fit inside a matchbox.

313
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:17,940
When the doctor told me your
mother had died in childbirth

314
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,380
I couldn't look at you
for weeks...

315
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,860
It was nonsense, but i
somehow blamed you

316
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:33,780
for taking her away from me.

317
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:41,180
And then one night your
crying made me open my eyes

318
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:47,580
and I saw those two feet.
So tiny...

319
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:52,020
My little daughter.

320
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:02,820
I've been a good father tonight
and made you some cookies.

321
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:12,340
I prepared a gift for you.

322
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:17,340
It belonged to your mother...

323
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,540
Take it.

324
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,980
It's part of your dowry now.

325
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:40,500
What grace!

326
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:47,580
More than 500 years of history
rest on your pretty neck.

327
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,300
Ages ago it belonged to
your great-great-grandmother

328
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:58,660
who lived in Spain,
our old fatherland...

329
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:05,020
In those times we helped the
Spaniards to push the Arabs

330
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:11,580
back to Africa, but the
Catholic king betrayed us:

331
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,940
He ordered that Spain expel
anyone who didn't wear

332
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:23,460
a cross around their neck. That's
how we ended up here, among

333
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:30,180
these belligerent Balkan peoples.
A new war every now and then...

334
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,620
It wasn't all that bad. You made
a fortune from their intolerance!

335
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,860
We don't take sides anymore.
And, above all, we do not mix.

336
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,300
Has the Greek army ever
found out how you supplied

337
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,220
both them and the Turks?
- Shut up, you brat!

338
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:49,780
The whole town's gossiping about your
secret dates with that gangster.

339
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:55,580
He's a football player, Dad.
- People are laughing behind my back!

340
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,500
Because I love a penniless
man from another religion?

341
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,300
This world is not
made out of love!

342
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,260
Every bird should flock
with its own kind.

343
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:23,060
If you ever abandon your flock,
Rebecca, you'll die alone, doomed.

344
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,980
Attack in W-W formation:
wings, half-backs, center;

345
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,860
then midfielders,
center-midfield and fullback.

346
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:18,980
Easy, Yordan! Keep it low!

347
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:25,020
Good day, Herr Pavlovich!

348
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:28,980
Who are you cheering for
today? Us or the Croats?

349
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:32,420
I'm not cheering for,
I'm cheering against.

350
00:30:37,819 --> 00:30:41,340
Hey, referee!
You got a daughter?

351
00:30:42,819 --> 00:30:46,220
You don't have to score a great
goal. A small one also counts!

352
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:52,340
Get it, pass it, play!
Like the tango, pa -pah-pah!

353
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,780
What are you doing, man? The
ball has to be on the foot!

354
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:36,700
Sorry, i'm not feeling
well today...

355
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:40,860
Need a doctor? - Sure.
Someone to examine my head.

356
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,901
I spent the whole night out
in the rain, like an idiot!

357
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:52,060
Spread it wide! Open up!
Escape your marker...

358
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,980
Don't pull those faces at me!
It's all your fault!

359
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,660
What do you mean "my fault"?
- Who's talking to you, Dimitriy?

360
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,700
Don't address me in
that tone of voice!

361
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:10,700
Oh, i see! Now we suddenly
don't know each other?

362
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,420
What the hell's wrong
with you today?

363
00:32:12,579 --> 00:32:14,660
Can't you just shut
up for a second, Dimitriy?

364
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:19,260
Now shoot! Shoot!

365
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,220
Yes! Goal!

366
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,260
There is a God in Heaven...

367
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,820
There, this one was for you!

368
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:36,780
Do you want me to score
another one?

369
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:40,460
Go ahead! Your wish is my
command, you toffee-nosed brat!

370
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:43,340
Who are you calling
toffee-nosed, you hooligan?

371
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:50,420
You, darling! You're a stuck-up,
snobbish, spoil t little brat!

372
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,340
And you know what you are?

373
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:57,580
You're a braggart, a peasant,
a smuggler - and a skirt chaser!

374
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,620
Me, a smuggler?
- Watch out!

375
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:04,060
Kosta! We all play
together here!

376
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,580
Kosta! Pull yourself together!

377
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,100
Get back, everybody!
Play defense!

378
00:33:53,059 --> 00:33:54,340
Retreat!

379
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:02,500
I told you to keep left...

380
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:12,020
"Women make the highs hs higher
and the lows more frequent."

381
00:34:12,579 --> 00:34:15,140
What did you say?
- I'm quoting Nietzsche.

382
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,980
I mean, what do you say
about the match?

383
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,660
I say: every match
has two halves.

384
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:52,820
We need to put in more work.

385
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:55,620
Let's face it, Dimitriy,
we're not good enough.

386
00:34:57,019 --> 00:34:59,459
And even your former football
legend can't make us any better.

387
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:01,060
And even your former football
legend can't make us any better.

388
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:03,340
Shut your face, Skeptic!

389
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:07,020
What? You blame me
for your failure?

390
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,060
No. But i wouldn't mind us
winning for a change!

391
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:17,820
All right. Our next training
will be at the railway station.

392
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:20,700
Don't come in jerseys.
Bring some old clothes.

393
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:29,220
What's that crap he just said?

394
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:13,580
What is it, Pepo? - Someone
left this in front of our door.

395
00:36:15,219 --> 00:36:20,260
For me? - i'm sure it's
not for your father, Miss.

396
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:40,860
PEOPLE ARE LIKE SHOES
- THEY COME IN PAIRS!

397
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,700
Here he comes!

398
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,620
Good morning, gentlemen!

399
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:15,380
Everything going swell?

400
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:20,340
No no, thank you. i'll just
leave it here for now.

401
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,500
Come with me! The training
begins inside in a minute.

402
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:34,300
Get inside, please.

403
00:37:37,219 --> 00:37:40,420
Now, each of you take one
of these brooms and brushes.

404
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,940
What's this, the famous
German sense of humor?

405
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:46,180
You said you wanted
to win for a change?

406
00:37:47,019 --> 00:37:48,980
This is how the change begins.

407
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,900
My trunk is waiting outside.

408
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:05,100
Either start cleaning,
or i catch the next train!

409
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,260
You're not going to
join your president?

410
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:30,180
Loyalty is the first of the
Bushido vikues... Pancho.

411
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,820
Skeptic?

412
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:45,660
Yordan...

413
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:48,820
Stambol?

414
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:01,940
For today's training I'd like
to tell you an old German tale.

415
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:07,900
It's about a boy who dreamed
of finding the Holy Grail,

416
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:11,420
the same way you dream of
winning a match.

417
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:16,500
He set off on a quest and ended
up in the castle of an old man

418
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:20,980
who offered him a cup
to drink from.

419
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:27,180
The cup was the Grail itself
but the boy was too immature

420
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:31,820
to recognize it. First he had to
grow, both spiritually and mentally.

421
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:37,020
Africa! You cannot remove
that stain by brushing.

422
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,420
You need to scrape it off,
with your fingernails.

423
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:54,340
Some say our Savior
drank from that cup.

424
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,340
Others say it contained His blood.
However, it was divinely perfect.

425
00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:00,580
Others say it contained His blood.
However, it was divinely perfect.

426
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:07,860
So this story is a metaphor
of a quest for perfection.

427
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:13,260
Whatever a man does
whether he's playing football

428
00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:18,900
or cleaning a dim toilet, he
should do it to perfection.

429
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:28,220
Now stop! Look at the result of
your work and tell me:

430
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:33,740
Is this floor perfectly cleaned?

431
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:43,060
No, it's not. Look!

432
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:49,380
Which means you should
try harder.

433
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,420
Especially you.

434
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:05,300
And remember! it's not the goal
that's important, but the quest itself.

435
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,260
Keep working!

436
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:13,660
Have you finished the guest-list
for the birthday party?

437
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,500
I have, sir. - You've invited
the rabbi? - Certainly.

438
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:21,220
And did you call the Governor?
- I sent him an invitation.

439
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:24,300
I told you to call
him personally.

440
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,861
Good morning.
- Morning.

441
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,460
What's the news today?

442
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:33,540
How would i know?
I'm illiterate!

443
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,460
What does it say, Pepo? i don't
have my glasses with me.

444
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:42,340
"Yugoslavia has joined the
Tripartite Pact. Following the

445
00:41:42,659 --> 00:41:46,260
signing, our Prime Minister
attended a long conference

446
00:41:46,659 --> 00:41:53,860
with Mr Hitler in person."
- Hitler? Are you sure?

447
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,020
Hitler! - Take the
Governor off the guest list!

448
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:05,100
Good morning.
- Morning.

449
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,420
Morning, morning...

450
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:16,140
I'm sure it's a good day for his
damned Ayan Race!

451
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,580
Allow me to say that he never
declared himself a Nazi.

452
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:23,260
Even worse! An undercover Nazi
coaching a gang of local goons.

453
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:26,380
Such wonderful company
my daughter keeps!

454
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,460
Speaking of her, where is she
right now? - At the lake,

455
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,180
with the choir. - What
a chance for him to infiltrate!

456
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:38,220
It's a female choir, sir.
- Don't be stupid, Pepo!

457
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,860
You can never be safe
with those hoodlums!

458
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,140
Where is Rebecca?

459
00:44:02,739 --> 00:44:07,380
I just came to say good-bye.
We're traveling to Belgrade

460
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:10,780
tomorrow. We've got a bi
match with Serbian Sword.

461
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,540
Remember the folk poem
when King Marko asks

462
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:17,780
the Faiy Samovila to give
him strength to fight?

463
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:21,820
I need that kind of
encouragement now...

464
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:30,860
Happy birthday, Samovila.
You're a big girl now.

465
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,820
Servus, butcher.
- Servus, Papas.

466
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:49,260
Have you noticed that nobody
broadcasts music any more?

467
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:53,260
Only politics!
- Right.

468
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:56,940
Three days ago the Government
signed a treaty with the Germans.

469
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:02,060
Now they've changed their minds
and they're clinging to the Brits.

470
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,260
God knows whose ass well be
licking next week!

471
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:07,900
Maybe the Russians?

472
00:46:08,139 --> 00:46:11,020
Maybe the Russians.
Or maybe the Eskimos.

473
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:14,020
That's the only one
we haven't tried yet.

474
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,420
See? Politics again!

475
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:26,100
Wait a second,
this isn't politics...

476
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,780
Thank you, Lord!
Thank you so much!

477
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,740
Watch out!

478
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:46,500
Pardon me, Miss Rebecca...
I was running to the tavern...

479
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:49,380
They just said it on the
radio! The Kraut and the boys...

480
00:46:50,139 --> 00:46:53,180
They won! We beat Serbian
Sword in the heart of Belgrade!

481
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:07,220
They're coming!
They're coming!

482
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,580
Gentlemen!
"God save our King!"

483
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:28,780
On behalf of the Governor
and the City Council,

484
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,300
I extend a warm welcome...

485
00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:54,100
I know i ran away from home,
but can't you see we won?!

486
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,860
You're my hero!

487
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:10,100
What?

488
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,900
What are you looking at?
You got your victory.

489
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:16,180
Serbian Sword must be
a pretty lousy team

490
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,380
if you managed to beat them...

491
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:22,220
Put me down, you hoodlums!

492
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,500
Dimitriy, tell them...

493
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:27,220
Lift him higher, guys!

494
00:49:31,659 --> 00:49:32,980
Kosta!

495
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:44,260
Congratulations!

496
00:49:45,699 --> 00:49:48,540
You going some place?
- I am.

497
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,980
Alone?
- I hope not.

498
00:49:55,179 --> 00:49:57,380
You know your father will
never give us his blessing.

499
00:49:58,940 --> 00:49:58,940
You're Jewish, and i'm
Orthodox Christian...

500
00:50:00,019 --> 00:50:00,700
You're Jewish, and i'm
Orthodox Christian...

501
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,180
And i thought i was a Virgo
and you were a Sagittarius.

502
00:50:06,059 --> 00:50:07,420
I lied.

503
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,020
Actually i'm Leo.
A lion-heart-ed Leo!

504
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:41,140
It's cozy.
- A bit cramped...

505
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,340
I'm glad I didn't drag
my piano with me.

506
00:50:46,139 --> 00:50:50,060
We'll sleep on your coat
and use mine as a blanket.

507
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:54,260
I'll borrow some money
to buy a mattress...

508
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:03,860
There! Now it feels
like home.

509
00:51:22,659 --> 00:51:24,940
And now what?

510
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:36,060
What's up, Mouzafar?

511
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,340
The victorious German air
force has commenced

512
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,860
the bombing of Yugoslavia
and Greece. After 20 years

513
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:03,500
of occupation, the Serbian
army is leaving Macedonia.

514
00:52:04,019 --> 00:52:06,820
Today, this tormented county
hails the steady march of its

515
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:14,780
liberators: the united German,
Italian and Bulgarian armies.

516
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:19,620
A glorious HURRAHS echoes
throughout the land!

517
00:52:36,179 --> 00:52:36,980
Major Gavranov?

518
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:41,140
Garvanoff. Colonel Garvanoff.
- On behalf of liberated

519
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,540
Macedonia, i present you the
Macedonia Football Club.

520
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:49,340
Macedonia? "Of all the gems
in my crown, the only one missing

521
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:54,460
is the shiniest diamond of them
all - Macedonia." Who said that?

522
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:59,460
Saint Paul?
- Our King, Boris the Third.

523
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:04,580
Football, huh? Can they play?
- We've had a couple

524
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:07,660
of tough seasons, but we're
in good shape now.

525
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,460
We've got a new coach:
Herr Spitz from Germany!

526
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:17,140
Spib? - Rudolph Spitz!
Former Prussian striker...

527
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,140
and one of the best coaches
in Central Europe!

528
00:53:21,179 --> 00:53:23,340
How do you do, Spitz?
- Fine.

529
00:53:23,619 --> 00:53:27,780
Louder, Spitz. i can't hear you.
- I'm fine.

530
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:34,340
Good. Major Heinrich will be
pleased to learn we've met.

531
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:38,980
You do remember Heinrich
from the SS, don't you? - Yes.

532
00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:42,900
Well, Heinrich says "Mister
Spitz is our lost treasure.

533
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:47,940
We go to Austria and he
disappears in Czechoslovakia.

534
00:53:48,579 --> 00:53:52,820
We march into Czechoslovakia
and he goes to Poland."

535
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,340
Mr Pavlov, you seem to possess
the pearl that has somehow

536
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:04,340
slipped through our fingers!
But there's just one small

537
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:11,780
detail missing... You know
the procedure, Mr Spitz?

538
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:35,260
There! It's all in place now!

539
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:41,340
We're one nation now!
One kingdom!

540
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:44,500
Your club will be included in
our National Football League.

541
00:54:49,139 --> 00:54:53,340
Macedonia eh? A melting pot
of people and religions!

542
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:59,420
"The Macedonian ethnic chaos must
be removed from our new frontiers."

543
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:01,860
Who said that?
- King Boris?

544
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:06,460
No, the Fuhrer himself! Go on
with your practice, Pavlov.

545
00:55:07,019 --> 00:55:09,780
Your first match is in mo weeks.

546
00:55:29,179 --> 00:55:34,660
I never lied to you.
My father is German.

547
00:55:37,539 --> 00:55:40,940
But my mother... She was...

548
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:43,540
- Jewish!

549
00:55:44,019 --> 00:55:47,940
Killed! The elders
were executed on the spot.

550
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,460
I'm very sorry.

551
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:03,980
Well, being a Jew isn't
contagious, right?

552
00:56:04,219 --> 00:56:06,460
Shut up, Pancho!
- You shut up, Dimitriy!

553
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:10,620
A Kraut or a kike, what
difference does it make?

554
00:56:11,739 --> 00:56:14,820
To us, he's the most precious
in the world!

555
00:56:40,099 --> 00:56:43,980
But wait... This isn't legal!

556
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,180
A healthy mind supports
the New Race!

557
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:12,860
Healthy forces create
the New Order!

558
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:16,220
Through sport we celebrate the
beauty of our nation.

559
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:20,620
Battling on the football field we
prepare for the real battlefields.

560
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:30,820
No New Order without proper
hygiene! isn't that right?

561
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,140
And what's your name,
pretty girl?

562
00:57:39,699 --> 00:57:42,340
What's wrong? Are you
deaf and dumb?

563
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,180
Really?

564
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:59,020
Such a perfect woman:
Pretty and dumb.

565
00:58:00,619 --> 00:58:05,340
My niece from the country.
Times are tough. Nobody wants

566
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:09,060
an extra mouth to feed and
so they sent her to town.

567
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:14,020
Niece or concubine,
that's your business.

568
00:58:23,739 --> 00:58:27,020
And what's that? - That
belongs to our coach.

569
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:33,420
He hung it there for good
luck. - A Jewish menorah

570
00:58:33,659 --> 00:58:37,780
for good luck! in a team that
plays in the National League?

571
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,981
I'll tell to him to remove it
right away.

572
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:43,620
And where is that coach now?

573
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:52,540
Let me have
a little word with him.

574
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:01,420
So today, the Spartacus
footballers will cross swords

575
00:59:01,699 --> 00:59:05,220
with their Macedonia
brothers. Salute the flags!

576
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,500
You aren't going to salute?

577
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:34,140
No... I believe i'm not allowed.
- And yet you think you're allowed

578
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:38,620
to flaunt that in the faces of
our officers and soldiers?

579
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:43,660
According to the new rules,
Jews are forbidden from

580
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:49,580
attending public gatherings.
I'm only letting you do

581
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:53,540
your job because i want
them to see you defeated.

582
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:59,780
But if you ever approach the
sideline again, i'll have you shot

583
01:00:00,699 --> 01:00:06,740
in front of the entire stadium.
Got that?

584
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,780
Now get out of my sight!

585
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,900
He kicked Spitz out.
- Filthy bastard!

586
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,500
Remember what Spitz said
about how "It's not the goal

587
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,220
that's important
but the quest"?

588
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,061
Well, this time the
goal is important...

589
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:46,340
At least a three-goal margin!

590
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:49,460
"Culture pages: A concert
by the Army orchestra.

591
01:00:50,659 --> 01:00:53,060
The Golden City, a German
movie..." - Keep reading!

592
01:00:54,659 --> 01:00:57,860
There's nothing more to read.
Not a word about our win.

593
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:02,140
They won't print that they lost.
- But half the town was there!

594
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,300
If it's not in the paper
it never happened.

595
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:09,340
How's it coming along, maestro?

596
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:13,740
It'll hold. Just don't step on
it too hard or the nails

597
01:01:14,139 --> 01:01:16,660
might stick through
up to your throat.

598
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:48,500
Poor Gypsies! They had a circus
before the war.

599
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:52,220
Magic tricks, stunts on
horseback and what-not...

600
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:55,660
The soldiers confiscated their
horses so the Gypsies tried to

601
01:01:55,940 --> 01:02:02,060
steal a few stallions off a train...
Too bad it was a military train!

602
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,100
Take your positions!

603
01:02:09,099 --> 01:02:11,340
Load! Aim!

604
01:02:19,179 --> 01:02:20,220
Fire!

605
01:02:25,139 --> 01:02:28,460
It's war! Soldiers shoot.
That's their job.

606
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:34,900
What? You think they left their
homes and their families

607
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,420
to come here and shoot
people for fun?

608
01:02:44,139 --> 01:02:47,740
Orders are orders.
It's not easy for anybody.

609
01:02:48,699 --> 01:02:51,580
Soon all this will be over.
This war will give birth

610
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:54,860
to a new Europe and centuries
of peace will follow...

611
01:02:55,219 --> 01:02:57,940
Until then, let's keep politics
and ideology asi_e!

612
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:02,060
We're here to play football.
That all that matters. Football!

613
01:03:04,099 --> 01:03:05,820
Salute the flags!

614
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,940
Africa! Don't play the goat
or we'll all be screwed!

615
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:23,020
We'll all end up in the
slammer, you dimwit!

616
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:41,580
It's because of his injury.
He fell bad the other day

617
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,700
during practice. Broke his
finger. The nerve snapped...

618
01:03:45,019 --> 01:03:47,980
I heard you won again. Three-nil,
was it? - Four-nil.

619
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:52,060
Four-nil? He saved every
shot with an injured finger?

620
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:55,220
Bravo! An amazing sportsman!

621
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:59,220
Please, Mr Garvanoff...
He's my only goalkeeper.

622
01:03:59,659 --> 01:04:01,659
Those damned Serbs beat
the daylights out of him...

623
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:03,860
His brain is damaged!
- Then we'll have it repaired!

624
01:04:04,219 --> 01:04:07,180
We're specialists in lobotomy.
- Mr Garvanom, I beg you...

625
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:10,700
And you should be
begging me, Pavlov.

626
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:20,380
Very few of our patients
leave this institution

627
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,980
in such good shape!

628
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:32,060
Explain that to your goalie.

629
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:57,580
Sorry... i can't.

630
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:07,900
Me neither.

631
01:05:12,619 --> 01:05:18,860
I'm a bit tense. We play
Locomotive tomorrow.

632
01:05:20,539 --> 01:05:21,860
And they're so fucking good...

633
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:28,460
Don't be so coarse!
- What did i say?

634
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:36,700
I went to the Jewish
neighborhood.

635
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:44,060
To your father's house?
- No. To Jamilla's.

636
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:53,980
Jamilla-vanilla. How's she?

637
01:05:55,139 --> 01:05:59,100
Bad. There's a new law forbidding
our people from doing anything.

638
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:02,460
Kids aren't allowed to go to
school. Adults aren't allowed

639
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:04,820
to work. They aren't even
allowed to listen to the news

640
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:07,740
anymore. The police have
confiscated their radios...

641
01:06:08,059 --> 01:06:10,780
All this stuff is such
a load of shit!

642
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,380
What did i say now?
Shit! That's what it is!

643
01:06:24,139 --> 01:06:27,700
You know, i've never bothered
about big and important things.

644
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:31,020
I was never into politics,
like Dimitriy.

645
01:06:32,539 --> 01:06:35,020
I'd never risk my neck for
ideals like Africa.

646
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,580
A good life was the only thing
that ever mattered to me.

647
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:48,220
But now I feel like i have
to do something.

648
01:06:50,699 --> 01:06:54,860
To smack somebody,
or score two goals...

649
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:04,060
Or buy two tickets to Shitville...
- You're really coarse!

650
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:08,100
OK, three tickets then.

651
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:16,700
Three tickets would do.

652
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:20,820
What do you mean?

653
01:07:25,219 --> 01:07:26,340
You're shitting me?

654
01:07:26,619 --> 01:07:28,700
Oh, please stop being
so coarse!

655
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:40,300
Calm down... You've got a
big game tomorrow!

656
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,300
Daddy's little baby!

657
01:07:46,659 --> 01:07:49,620
Tomorrow i'll beat the crap
out of Locomotive!

658
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:54,340
"The eleven proud sons of
the ancient Macedonian land

659
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:58,220
once again adorned themselves
with laurel wreaths."

660
01:08:00,099 --> 01:08:06,020
This rubbish makes me heave!
- We did as you said.

661
01:08:07,539 --> 01:08:09,180
And who gave you
permission to address me?

662
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,300
Why didn't you call a
penalty-kick? - I did.

663
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:17,620
How many?
- One.

664
01:08:18,939 --> 01:08:22,900
One was not enough.
More were needed.

665
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:27,220
Five, ten, fifty penalty kicks!

666
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:29,700
There was no foul...
- You don't say?

667
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:34,700
Petar Ivanov Tatarchev.
Is that you?

668
01:08:36,699 --> 01:08:39,100
Brother of Simeon Ivanov
Tatarchev,

669
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:45,780
a student at the University of
Economics in Varna?

670
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:48,340
Yes.
- Not any more.

671
01:08:48,819 --> 01:08:52,740
As of Monday your brother will
be serving the Fatherland.

672
01:08:54,939 --> 01:08:59,340
In the Navy. To see what's up
with the Russians!

673
01:09:00,539 --> 01:09:05,580
Please, Sir... He's my only kin.
- Look, you imbecile!

674
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:08,740
Macedonia is marching
towards the Champion's Cup!

675
01:09:08,979 --> 01:09:11,300
If they win the Cup - and that
kike's team becomes

676
01:09:11,619 --> 01:09:14,500
Ayan champions - do you know
what they'll do to me in Sofia?

677
01:09:14,899 --> 01:09:17,340
They'll skin me alive!
- I understand.

678
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:21,420
You understand shit.
Get out of here!

679
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:30,580
Shalom!

680
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:36,700
The synagogue is closed. We're
not allowed to pray here anymore.

681
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:42,020
You are not Sephardic?
- I'm Ashkenazi.

682
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:07,180
United Bulgaria reveals:
The Germans are advancing

683
01:11:07,619 --> 01:11:11,260
on Stalingrad! Another
Japanese victory in the Pacific!

684
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:16,580
Macedonia defeats Benkovski in
Sofia and moves up to 2nd place!

685
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:36,620
Fuck! The fish!

686
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:47,380
Cooking is one of the greatest
privileges of mankind.

687
01:11:53,859 --> 01:11:57,140
It is foolish to relinquish
such a pleasure to women.

688
01:12:02,779 --> 01:12:07,820
Dimyat. Made from grapes
grown on the Black Sea coast.

689
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:09,660
From back home?

690
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:15,180
You'd be surprised to know my
homeland is actually Macedonia.

691
01:12:16,619 --> 01:12:20,260
My grandfather was a Christian
rebel. After the failed uprising

692
01:12:20,539 --> 01:12:26,980
against the Turks, he fled to Bulgaria.
And now the circle is complete:

693
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:33,940
Here I am,
returning as a liberator!

694
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,380
We may even be related.

695
01:12:38,939 --> 01:12:43,740
Balkan business: Either we're
cousins or we're enemies.

696
01:12:46,699 --> 01:12:48,740
Cheers!
- Cheers.

697
01:12:57,140 --> 01:13:01,260
I've told my superiors about
everything you've done

698
01:13:01,579 --> 01:13:03,980
for our cause.
- Thank you.

699
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:07,900
I've also recommended they
help you start your own paper.

700
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:10,900
Thank you so much.

701
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:17,180
You should thank your talent,
and ty not to waste it.

702
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:22,060
I believe i invest my utmost...

703
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:29,060
You do, you do... but sometimes
you invest in the wrong things.

704
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:43,860
You're playing against Levski
on Sunday, right? - Right.

705
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:49,980
Who would have thought it?
Such a small team in the finals,

706
01:13:50,619 --> 01:13:55,020
playing for the title... Right?
- Right.

707
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:02,500
A telegram for you.

708
01:14:05,659 --> 01:14:12,540
From Mr Batembergski,
our Minister of Sport.

709
01:14:20,619 --> 01:14:25,380
So...? - So, a chicken cannot
defeat an eagle!

710
01:14:28,619 --> 01:14:32,380
Abandon those idiotic dreams
of winning the cup.

711
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:36,220
What you've achieved
so var is enough!

712
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:40,100
I thought that football
was an honest game.

713
01:14:40,539 --> 01:14:46,940
Maybe it is, but we're dealing
with something else here.

714
01:14:49,779 --> 01:14:55,060
Your career...
among other things.

715
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:59,100
We won't do any dribbling
or kicking today.

716
01:15:00,819 --> 01:15:03,140
You know that better than i do.

717
01:15:04,579 --> 01:15:06,580
Do you remember those
Charlie Chaplin movies

718
01:15:06,899 --> 01:15:08,700
we used to watch before the war?

719
01:15:08,979 --> 01:15:11,980
There was one where he
volunteered as a sparring partner

720
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:16,180
in a boxing ring. The guy he
challenged was a real giant.

721
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:20,020
So Charlie hid a horseshoe
in his boxing glove...

722
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:22,700
Remember that one?

723
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:28,380
The entire world knows that
a man's real power

724
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:33,620
doesn't lie in his size
but in his heart and mind.

725
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:39,380
Tomorrow you are facing the
royal champions.

726
01:15:41,739 --> 01:15:43,300
Everybody will be against you:

727
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:49,500
a great team, the referees,
the authorities...

728
01:15:54,539 --> 01:15:57,540
This whole football thing has
become more than just a game.

729
01:15:59,899 --> 01:16:02,140
I wish you...

730
01:16:04,659 --> 01:16:10,100
all that you deserve.

731
01:16:16,699 --> 01:16:18,140
What about you?

732
01:16:19,619 --> 01:16:22,780
Garvanoff's new order: I am
not allowed anywhere

733
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:27,620
near the stadium anymore.
This was my last lecture.

734
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:42,780
Today is the most
important day in my life

735
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:46,100
and they want me to
give it all up!

736
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:51,380
I heard the news from the front.
The Russians are fighting back,

737
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:55,500
forcing our allies to retreat.
I refuse to believe that.

738
01:16:56,020 --> 01:17:01,660
I can't imagine the world
under their rule!

739
01:17:03,859 --> 01:17:08,380
Well, it's too late to
change sides now.

740
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:14,060
Mr Pavlov... She can't
hear you anymore.

741
01:17:19,859 --> 01:17:20,780
I know.

742
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,780
Here comes the radio!
Here comes civilization!

743
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:35,780
Good morning to all sport
fans throughout the kingdom!

744
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:38,980
We are broadcasting live
from the Skopje city stadium,

745
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:41,580
awaiting the beginning of
the final match

746
01:17:41,979 --> 01:17:44,540
between Macedonia and Levski.
This is the championship game.

747
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:48,740
A fight that will decides
who raises the trophy cup!

748
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:54,620
A fight that will crown the
new champion of our great state!

749
01:17:59,979 --> 01:18:04,180
The Macedonia team runs onto
the pitch: we see the goalie

750
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:07,540
Metodiy Tsrnchev, then Dragan
Panchev, Petar Rafailov,

751
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:11,740
Fidan Zelenikov, Michail Tomov,
Yordan Popov, Onur Polat,

752
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:15,020
Tsanko Saramzaliev and
Kosta Simeonov

753
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:17,580
together with Teophil
Perchukliski.

754
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:23,260
Their coach, who we cannot see
at the moment, is Rudolph Spitz.

755
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:30,020
After saluting the flags, the team
captains approach the referee.

756
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:32,940
The Macedonia players
prepare for kick-off...

757
01:18:35,899 --> 01:18:38,900
We won the kick off!
- What are they kicking?

758
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:41,620
The ball, boss!
Our guys kick first.

759
01:18:43,659 --> 01:18:45,580
And how am I supposed to
know such vocabulary?

760
01:18:45,899 --> 01:18:48,540
This is the first match
I've heard in my life!

761
01:18:49,579 --> 01:18:54,100
The crowd's in a state of delirium!
The whole stadium is shaking!

762
01:18:54,659 --> 01:18:58,980
The delegates of the Ministry
of Sport greet the players.

763
01:19:00,699 --> 01:19:03,460
Now the referee gives the signal
and the match is underway!

764
01:19:28,899 --> 01:19:31,220
That's a foul! There's no
doubt that's a foul.

765
01:19:32,539 --> 01:19:34,220
I didn't even touch him...

766
01:19:51,859 --> 01:19:54,060
Referee, when are you going
to whistle for a foul?

767
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:56,460
When he pulls his arm off?

768
01:19:56,739 --> 01:19:59,179
Panchev is calling for a foul,
but apparently there's no foul.

769
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:01,020
Panchev is calling for a foul,
but apparently there's no foul.

770
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:04,100
Dimitriy, you should
call for a foul...

771
01:20:05,619 --> 01:20:08,340
A masterpiece! What a
sumptuous kick...

772
01:20:08,699 --> 01:20:12,980
but the goalie Tsrnchev
blocks this wonderful shot.

773
01:20:14,020 --> 01:20:15,500
Good, Africa!

774
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,780
It seems that Saramzaliev is
faking a serious injury...

775
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:35,700
Do something, Dimitriy! - We're
getting thrashed here!

776
01:20:53,539 --> 01:20:54,580
Shoot! Shoot!

777
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:03,260
Give us more rakiya!

778
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:16,260
Wait, wait...
It's been disallowed!

779
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:23,580
It's not right! Smack him!
Smack the bastard...

780
01:21:27,739 --> 01:21:30,860
Don't just sit there,
Dimitriy! Do something!

781
01:21:34,659 --> 01:21:39,860
Don't let them destroy
you! Keep it together!

782
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:42,060
A new attack from Levski:
Just to moves forward and

783
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:46,140
makes a pass to Spasov who's
all alone in the penalty area...

784
01:21:46,899 --> 01:21:48,180
Offside!

785
01:21:51,819 --> 01:21:53,180
Kick him in the shins!

786
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:10,580
And it's a goal!

787
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:29,260
Levski end the first half
with a one-nil lead!

788
01:22:31,579 --> 01:22:33,100
Every match has two halves...

789
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,260
Wow! Look who's here.

790
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:46,940
Dimitriy! Come to spin the yarn
about the Olympic Games again?

791
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,460
Or have you sold your team
in the meantime?

792
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:55,180
I brought this one to remind me
that i'm neither Chaplin

793
01:22:55,500 --> 01:23:01,620
nor King David. i'm just nobody
and I have no clue how to use it.

794
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:06,540
But it might bring
good luck to you.

795
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:10,220
Now, run!

796
01:23:11,939 --> 01:23:14,420
Now give your best and more!

797
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:24,020
Remember what we said
at trainings:

798
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:29,940
combine, change speed,
then run back.

799
01:23:30,619 --> 01:23:33,820
All together in defense.
Teamwork is the first priority!

800
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:36,580
And above all, believe
in what you're doing!

801
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:40,460
Spread it wide!
Spread the game...

802
01:23:42,979 --> 01:23:44,580
Go, go, go!

803
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:54,020
Now it's becoming serious.

804
01:24:06,819 --> 01:24:09,460
Play faster! Faster!

805
01:24:17,859 --> 01:24:18,980
Shoot! Shoot!

806
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:37,420
Macedonia Levski, one-all.

807
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:47,460
But it's not over yet,
we've got more to do...

808
01:24:57,539 --> 01:24:59,019
And that's a foul in
the penalty area!

809
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:01,500
And that's a foul in
the penalty area!

810
01:25:01,539 --> 01:25:05,380
Panchev protests and his
entire team protest, but...

811
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:10,100
The referee sends off the
Macedonia player Panchev

812
01:25:10,659 --> 01:25:12,900
and calls for a penalty
kick for Levski!

813
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:17,260
Are you nuts?!
But why? Why?

814
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:36,380
The clock is ticking. is there still time
for more dramatic developments?

815
01:26:36,739 --> 01:26:39,740
Five minutes left. - Give up!
No use in having a horseshoe

816
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:42,100
in our locker room if we've
got no luck on the field.

817
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:44,460
It's not about luck, Yordan,
we need...

818
01:26:45,899 --> 01:26:48,740
Damn it! A horseshoe.
That's what we need!

819
01:26:48,979 --> 01:26:51,100
You have to stretch the rules...

820
01:26:51,380 --> 01:26:52,980
Skeptic! Over here!

821
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:55,380
To create magic on the pitch.

822
01:26:55,539 --> 01:26:57,940
That's what we need:
A hidden horseshoe!

823
01:26:58,220 --> 01:27:02,820
Here's the plan: Everybody on
the left side except for Skeptic!

824
01:27:03,779 --> 01:27:05,740
But Kostah they're invincible
on the left side...

825
01:27:05,979 --> 01:27:08,220
Just shut up and believe me,
Skeptic! Just believe in it!

826
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:09,540
Get ready to run...

827
01:27:09,819 --> 01:27:10,820
Come on!

828
01:27:19,619 --> 01:27:20,780
Pass it over...

829
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:38,780
He can't strike!

830
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:41,420
But he can run!
Sprint, Skeptic!

831
01:27:41,699 --> 01:27:42,300
Run!

832
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:54,020
And that's the end of the match,
Macedonia versus Levski two-one!

833
01:27:54,539 --> 01:27:57,820
Unbelievable! A provincial club
becoming the imperial champions

834
01:27:58,220 --> 01:28:00,580
during the last minute of the game.

835
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:57,900
Spitz! Spitz! Spitz!

836
01:29:07,819 --> 01:29:13,700
My dear friends, football
players, Mr President...

837
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:22,180
This place, which has been a
sanctuary for this young couple,

838
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:30,820
and a true haven to the rest of
you, playing here like kids...

839
01:29:33,859 --> 01:29:40,140
I've traveled all over Europe,
avoiding evil people...

840
01:29:41,979 --> 01:29:47,820
But no place in the world
deserves to be called home

841
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,380
as much as this little
locker room.

842
01:29:56,699 --> 01:29:58,260
Here's to our coach!
- To Rudolph Spitz!

843
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:01,581
Here's to our coach!
- To Rudolph Spitz!

844
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:37,460
There you are!

845
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:43,500
Good morning.

846
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:45,820
What's happening?

847
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:50,260
The old must be torn down
to make way for the New.

848
01:30:50,539 --> 01:30:53,780
Our Prime Minister Filov and
his Government guarantee

849
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:56,820
the safety of your
lives and your property...

850
01:30:57,899 --> 01:31:01,940
According to the Law for National
Protection, persons of Jewish descent

851
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:05,380
are to be defined as "those whose
parents are Jewish, those whose

852
01:31:05,779 --> 01:31:07,940
parents are Jewish and
converted to Christianity,

853
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,820
those born in a
Jewish-Christian marriage,

854
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:14,220
and those born in a
Jewish-Muslim marriage."

855
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:18,500
I saw Zahariev, the neighbor.
He works for the police.

856
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:23,540
He says they're sending us to
Bulgaria as forced labor.

857
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:27,140
Why? Have they run out
of Jews in Bulgaria?

858
01:31:28,579 --> 01:31:32,780
I heard that 43 members of
the Bulgarian Parliament

859
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:36,820
have signed a proclamation
against this deportation.

860
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:43,020
By the time the word gets here,
all of us will already be gone.

861
01:31:43,899 --> 01:31:48,780
Gone? Gone where?
- I wish i knew, Pepo.

862
01:32:07,779 --> 01:32:10,060
We will be remembered
as barbarians.

863
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:15,380
Barbarians? Don't be
pathetic, Pavlov.

864
01:32:17,380 --> 01:32:19,900
Barbarians are like primitive
organisms:

865
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:23,620
they prey, devour, and
afterwords they fart...

866
01:32:25,380 --> 01:32:28,180
Barbaric tribes have no need
for ideology,

867
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:35,380
no visions of racial unity, no
dreams of a better society,

868
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:39,180
and no sophisticated system
for mass purification.

869
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:50,140
A primitive mind would never be
able to conceive or execute such

870
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:55,980
a complex idea as ours. The
action you're witnessing today,

871
01:32:56,460 --> 01:33:00,620
Pavlov, presents the zenith
of civilized man!

872
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:08,980
Loyalty to the new order cannot be
proven by wearing silk gloves.

873
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:16,300
It's time for you to take sides.

874
01:33:22,659 --> 01:33:25,260
I have to bring them water...
The only food they get

875
01:33:25,619 --> 01:33:28,300
is salted fish. And when they
get thirsty, the guards ask

876
01:33:28,659 --> 01:33:31,940
for money for water.
- You mustn't go there!

877
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:35,860
Papa doesn't have any money.
It was all left in the bank!

878
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:38,100
You mustn't go! Someone
might recognize you.

879
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:40,860
Nobody remembers me anymore!
- Why did you put that on?

880
01:33:41,779 --> 01:33:45,860
I've got to go, Kosta.
Every bird with its own flock.

881
01:33:47,779 --> 01:33:51,500
What else can I do? My people
have renounced me.

882
01:33:52,619 --> 01:33:58,140
I belong to no one. - You
belong to me! You're my wife.

883
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:14,220
You?

884
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:18,220
They sent you?

885
01:34:20,859 --> 01:34:24,060
Garvanoff has a sick
sense of humor.

886
01:34:30,579 --> 01:34:31,500
Raphael Cohen.

887
01:34:32,579 --> 01:34:36,860
Cohen! Raphael Cohen!

888
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:57,900
You've got two minutes.

889
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:07,780
My name is Kostadin.
I live with your daughter.

890
01:35:09,739 --> 01:35:15,220
Rebecca sends you this. She
wanted to deliver it in person,

891
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:19,300
but i locked her up in
the locker-room.

892
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:24,380
She cried! begging me to! et her
out... But it's too dangerous.

893
01:35:28,739 --> 01:35:31,620
So, that's it. Take it.

894
01:35:33,539 --> 01:35:35,140
Come on, take it.

895
01:35:39,779 --> 01:35:43,700
Rebecca is pregnant.
We're going to have a baby.

896
01:35:47,619 --> 01:35:49,620
So... you've locked her up?

897
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:56,660
Smart move. i did the same
once, but it did no good.

898
01:35:57,619 --> 01:35:59,620
She ran away with you.

899
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:09,260
For the baby.
A gift from grandpa.

900
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:20,060
This is my father, Shimon.
And my sisters...

901
01:36:23,899 --> 01:36:31,180
And this is me and Rebecca's
mother when we were young.

902
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:33,740
What was her name?

903
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:39,900
Hannah. She was...

904
01:36:41,859 --> 01:36:43,220
Very beautiful.

905
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:55,700
That's all that's left
of my whole life.

906
01:36:56,619 --> 01:36:58,980
We'll look after them
until you come back.

907
01:36:59,819 --> 01:37:04,180
Let's not kid each other, boy.
I'm not coming back.

908
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:09,100
Tell my daughter... things
didn't work out my way.

909
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:15,540
My world is falling apart.
It's your turn now!

910
01:37:20,180 --> 01:37:21,860
Look after yourself, boy.

911
01:37:28,060 --> 01:37:30,140
Look after yourself...
Don Raphael.

912
01:37:35,659 --> 01:37:39,460
The Ministry of Sport has annulled
the National League finals.

913
01:37:39,899 --> 01:37:42,460
Levski have been declared
the new champions following

914
01:37:43,020 --> 01:37:46,340
the formal award of a three-nil
victory against Macedonia.

915
01:37:47,819 --> 01:37:51,420
And here is the weather
forecast: partly cloudy

916
01:37:52,140 --> 01:37:55,620
with a chance of
rain in the afternoon.

917
01:37:56,699 --> 01:37:59,420
We continue our broadcast
with popular music...

918
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:16,740
On a day like this, many years
ago, it was my birthday.

919
01:38:18,779 --> 01:38:23,940
My father surprised me with
a gift, my first football.

920
01:38:27,539 --> 01:38:31,580
I couldn't take my eyes off it.
I took it everywhere,

921
01:38:32,739 --> 01:38:36,300
even to the outhouse
on our family farm. When i

922
01:38:36,819 --> 01:38:39,700
pulled down my trousers,
the ball slipped away,

923
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:47,980
and fell right into a pile of shit.
A shiny ball sinking into shit...

924
01:38:52,539 --> 01:38:55,060
When i think about it now,
it seems like this event

925
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:57,940
determined my entire life.

926
01:39:08,020 --> 01:39:10,060
I'm frightened, Dimitriy!

927
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:24,460
The Italians are behind those
mountains. They don't persecute

928
01:39:24,899 --> 01:39:30,100
your people. if you can make it
over there, you're saved.

929
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:32,260
And what about you?

930
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:40,820
Hurry, Rudolph! Didn't you hear
the forecast? It's going to rain!

931
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:44,340
Please... run.

932
01:40:13,619 --> 01:40:15,380
I shall be brief.

933
01:40:15,659 --> 01:40:19,620
I am the town Commander
and you are the talk of my town.

934
01:40:20,859 --> 01:40:22,260
A regiment...

935
01:40:25,979 --> 01:40:29,300
A regiment of German soldiers
on furlough from Stalingrad

936
01:40:29,739 --> 01:40:34,620
is staying at our military hospital.
They've heard about you

937
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:42,100
and expressed a desire to play
a friendly match. Let them win!

938
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:45,500
How do we let them win?

939
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:50,860
By losing the match, that's how!
Is it clearer now?

940
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:56,220
After all, it's only a game!

941
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:09,660
I have a daughter. Hannah...
Born four hours ago.

942
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:12,700
She has a beautiful head
and the tiniest baby feet.

943
01:41:16,939 --> 01:41:19,900
Listen! i don't care who
beats who tomorrow.

944
01:41:20,899 --> 01:41:22,940
I finally know what
I want in life...

945
01:41:24,699 --> 01:41:26,220
I want Hannah to live!

946
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:37,060
They're gone!

947
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:39,660
What do you mean
"They're gone"?!

948
01:43:06,539 --> 01:43:09,420
Here we meet again, Dad...

949
01:43:10,939 --> 01:43:14,700
Remember me?
Your little daughter

950
01:43:15,579 --> 01:43:19,300
who listened to her heak
and ran away from you.

951
01:43:20,699 --> 01:43:25,580
Both you and the man i loved
have been dead

952
01:43:25,979 --> 01:43:30,140
for many years now. I'm
going to join you soon...

953
01:43:31,579 --> 01:43:35,980
But before i die, there's
something i'd like to show you.

954
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:48,100
These are my sons and daughters,
their husbands and wives,

955
01:43:48,739 --> 01:43:53,780
my grandchildren and
their children...

956
01:43:58,300 --> 01:44:01,900
They are the fruit
of my betrayal

957
01:44:02,539 --> 01:44:04,500
and the descendants
of your blood.

958
01:44:05,539 --> 01:44:10,980
They are my proof that a
woman can score as well...

959
01:44:14,819 --> 01:44:17,020
I won the game, papa!

960
01:44:20,645 --> 01:44:26,645
