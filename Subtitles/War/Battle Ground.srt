Sir, the Lieutenant orders you
to report to the command post.

38
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:09,519
lmmediately, sir.

39
00:05:10,607 --> 00:05:12,484
Right. Thank you, Private.

40
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:24,679
- Thought you'd done a runner, sir.
- Make way. Coming through.

41
00:05:26,447 --> 00:05:28,199
lt's a bit late for that, Rich.

42
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:32,039
Wait, wait. Hey, stop, stop.

43
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:40,477
- All right.
- He's one of the lucky ones.

44
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:48,281
What's it like out there? Have you seen it?

45
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,806
[soldier] Sir?

46

The Lieutenant.

47
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:01,677
- Get the men ready.
- Sir.

48
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:05,246
Come on.

49
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,961
All right, lads. Come on. Gather 'em up.

50
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:11,004
- Yes, sir.
- Right away, sir.

51
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:13,444
Move aside, lads! Come on!

52
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,677

Wilkins.

55
00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:26,760

The last bombardment
didn't quite do the job.

As you can hear,
most of their defences are intact.

60
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:47,763
Did any of them make it through, sir?

61
00:06:47,927 --> 00:06:49,599
No.

62
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,522
But l'm certain you'll have more success.

63
00:06:56,727 --> 00:06:59,161
Sir, with all due respect,

64
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,397
a forward assault
on those machine guns is suicide.

65
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:04,206
Those are your orders, Sergeant Major.

66
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,046
Yes, sir.

67
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,317
At 21 :00 hours the big boys
will be smashing the lines again,

68
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:13,637
if the Fritz still hold that trench.

69
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:16,685
Well, wouldn't it make more sense
to delay the next wave till then?

70
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:19,964
Let's save the strategy
for those who know best, shall we?

71
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,966
Yes, sir.

72
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:27,079
Just make damn sure you take that trench.

73
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,920
Any cowardice is to be punished.
Do you understand?

74
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:32,400
Sir.

75
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:37,406

You just keep the men moving.

80
00:08:16,927 --> 00:08:20,044
Yes, sir. No heroics.

81
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:25,565
Can you see anything?

82
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:33,636
Good luck, Rich.

83
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:36,086

lt's me. Stop it, boy.

201
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,721

[flare crackles]

203

[lieutenant aid] l can't see any action
on the field.

205
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:05,435
What do you suppose the Fritz
are shooting at, sir?

206
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:07,643
l haven't the foggiest.

207
00:26:08,207 --> 00:26:09,686
Makes no difference.

208
00:26:09,847 --> 00:26:12,645
At nine o'clock everything beyond that ridge
will be nothing but dust.

209
00:26:16,447 --> 00:26:17,926
Start moving the men.

210
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:21,395

Get your things together.

213
00:26:33,487 --> 00:26:34,886
We have to move.

214
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:41,844
l'm so sorry, Sergeant Major.

215
00:26:42,007 --> 00:26:43,520
Forget about it, Private.

216
00:26:46,327 --> 00:26:47,646
Frankie.

217
00:26:48,287 --> 00:26:50,039
Did you to happen see him out there, sir?

218
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:51,526
Private Franklin?

219
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:56,046
No.

220
00:27:00,527 --> 00:27:01,926
Such a git.

221
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:04,879
Never listened, you know,

222
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:07,800
but l promised his mam
that l'd... take care of him.

223
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:10,444
l'm sure you did your best.

224
00:27:11,927 --> 00:27:13,963
He's all l've got out here, sir.

225
00:27:15,247 --> 00:27:16,965
Do you think he might be nearby?

226
00:27:19,007 --> 00:27:20,998
Gotta get him home, sir.

227
00:27:21,847 --> 00:27:23,644
You just worry about yourself right now.

228
00:27:23,807 --> 00:27:25,877
You can bet Private Franklin
is doing the same.

229
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:31,720
But, sir, what if he's hurt?

230
00:27:31,887 --> 00:27:35,766
Sir, what if he's hurt or...?
Maybe he might be dead.

231
00:27:35,927 --> 00:27:37,519
[O'Leary grunts]

232
00:27:39,607 --> 00:27:41,484
Look out there, goddamnit! Look!

233
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:47,243
l don't wanna hear another word
about Private Franklin.

234
00:27:47,407 --> 00:27:48,442
Do you hear me?

235
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:50,401
Aye, sir.

236
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:54,442
A lot of good men died today.

237
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:56,643
Now get your things.

00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:14,646
O'Leary...

240
00:28:17,207 --> 00:28:19,880
We'll have time to mourn our friends later.

241
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:22,800
Right now, l need you on your game.

242
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,316
Yeah?

243
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:29,716
Good lad.

Now get your weapon.

- Where are you?
- [Jennings coughs]

254
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:12,160
Can you move?

255
00:29:13,407 --> 00:29:14,726
l don't think moving

256
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:17,481

257
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:20,476
All right.

258
00:29:20,647 --> 00:29:21,966
Hold tight.

[in German]

265
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,486
Sir, are you sure this is a good idea?

266
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:17,327
Corporal, are you still with me?

267
00:30:18,087 --> 00:30:20,078

[Wilkins groans]

269
00:30:29,687 --> 00:30:31,598
Come on, O'Leary. Try to keep up.

270
00:30:33,327 --> 00:30:34,680

Rich.

275

[Jennings] l'm not that hard done by,
Sergeant Major.

276

Where are you?

[Jennings coughs]

278
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:16,321
Rich.

279
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:22,285

Don't worry.
lt's a walk in the park from here.

283
00:31:33,967 --> 00:31:35,639
[Jennings] Don't worry about me, sir.

284
00:31:36,447 --> 00:31:38,085
lt only hurts when l breathe.

285
00:31:38,247 --> 00:31:40,044
All right.

286
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:42,726
We're going to get you out of here.

Get over the other side.

- Are you ready, O'Leary?
- Yeah.

302
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:41,161
OK. Let's go.

303
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:43,446

There's no way
you can drag me 400 yards through there.

00:35:20,807 --> 00:35:23,367
[sighs] You both stand
a better chance without me.

Don't be a damn fool, Arthur.

335
00:35:30,727 --> 00:35:32,126
Maybe one of us should go for help.

336
00:35:33,127 --> 00:35:36,005
l mean, surely one person
stands more of a chance of getting back

337
00:35:36,527 --> 00:35:38,165
than the three of us.

338
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:40,361
And then what, Private? What?

339
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:43,238
You'll bring the cavalry back to save us?

340
00:35:45,047 --> 00:35:48,244
- Leave the boy alone.
- lf we leave you here, you'll die.

You're going to have to give me a minute.

344
00:35:57,807 --> 00:35:59,843
l can't move just yet, though.

345
00:36:00,407 --> 00:36:02,079
The whole bloody world will hear me.

346
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:03,600
You don't have a minute.

347
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,926
You always look on the bright side.

348
00:36:09,087 --> 00:36:11,282
Always was your best quality!

349
00:36:11,447 --> 00:36:13,517
[Jennings laughs]

350
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,159
You haven't changed a bit.

351
00:36:19,087 --> 00:36:20,486
You have.

353
00:36:26,247 --> 00:36:31,879

this godforsaken patch of mud inch by inch,

l will.

355

00:36:56,887 --> 00:36:59,765
l don't suppose you have a deck of cards,
do you, Private?

358
00:37:00,447 --> 00:37:01,516
No, sir.

359
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:04,166
l didn't think so.

360
00:37:06,127 --> 00:37:08,083
lt's a pity Ollie is not here.

361
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:10,442
He always had a pack.

...do you remember who we were
when we first met?

368
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:03,803
Don't be too hard on yourself, sir.

369
00:38:05,807 --> 00:38:07,684
You're the sanest man l know.

370
00:38:13,687 --> 00:38:15,484

371

...l can't see her face any more.

00:38:23,527 --> 00:38:25,916
When l close my eyes,
it's just this photo that l see.

373
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,365
lt's still enough.

374
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:34,882
lt's enough to get you back home.

375
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:49,758
May l see, sir?

376
00:39:08,007 --> 00:39:10,805
l don't have anyone like this
waiting for me.

377
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:13,677
l wish l did.

378
00:39:14,527 --> 00:39:16,518
l'd carry a picture of my mam with me,

379
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,678
but the lads
would give me shite about that all day.

380
00:39:18,847 --> 00:39:19,916
[chuckles]

381
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:25,800
But l know she's there
waiting for me nonetheless.

382
00:40:16,527 --> 00:40:19,360
l'm sorry, Mrs Wilkins. l can't help you.

383
00:40:20,647 --> 00:40:22,717
l took a huge risk coming here.

384
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:25,915
l'm not fit to carry this child.

385
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:29,043
You helped that lady from Wessex.

386
00:40:29,767 --> 00:40:33,840
She had a medical condition
that endangered her life. You are healthy.

387
00:40:34,687 --> 00:40:37,918
There's more at risk here
than just my licence to practise.

388
00:40:39,007 --> 00:40:40,599
lt's out of the question, l'm afraid.

389
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:41,916
l'm sorry. Nurse!

390
00:40:42,287 --> 00:40:43,606
[door creaks]

391
00:40:45,687 --> 00:40:48,520
Please, sir. l'm desperate. l can pay.

392
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:53,277
The nurse will talk to you
about your health during pregnancy.

393
00:40:53,927 --> 00:40:55,997
- But...
- l have other patients waiting.

394
00:40:58,447 --> 00:41:00,005
[clock chimes]

395
00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:11,638
[door creaks]

396
00:41:17,327 --> 00:41:18,726
Just down here.

397
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:28,757
Whoa, whoa. Wait up.

398
00:41:28,927 --> 00:41:30,042
- Just wait.
- Sorry.

399
00:41:30,207 --> 00:41:31,799
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

400
00:41:31,967 --> 00:41:32,956
Just take a minute.

401
00:41:33,127 --> 00:41:34,242
[Grace clears throat]

402
00:41:34,407 --> 00:41:36,796
- OK. When you're ready.
- l'm all right.

403
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:38,525
Just take it easy.

404
00:41:49,047 --> 00:41:50,719
How long has your husband been away?

405
00:41:56,727 --> 00:41:59,560
My fiance was sent to Europe
nearly three years ago.

406
00:42:00,287 --> 00:42:02,278
[footsteps upstairs]

407
00:42:04,327 --> 00:42:06,841
Arthur was at the Western Front
last l heard.

408
00:42:07,007 --> 00:42:08,759
l haven't had a letter in over a year.

409
00:42:11,527 --> 00:42:13,882
The last one l got
had so many holes cut through it.

410
00:42:14,887 --> 00:42:17,162
lt's enough to catch the sentiment, but...

411
00:42:18,647 --> 00:42:20,956
...l can't stop worrying.

412
00:42:24,687 --> 00:42:26,040
[whispers] He'd be devastated.

413
00:42:26,247 --> 00:42:27,646
l can't let him suffer this.

414
00:42:27,807 --> 00:42:30,844
Or you can move away,
have the child and adopt it out.

415
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,201
l have nowhere to go.

416
00:42:33,647 --> 00:42:37,037
And if my family were to learn of it, they'd
disown me. l'd have nothing to come back to.

417
00:42:38,447 --> 00:42:42,235
Just don't make any rash decisions
until you've really thought it through.

418
00:42:44,087 --> 00:42:46,555
You're not the only one, Grace.

419
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,126
l should go.

420
00:42:53,927 --> 00:42:55,804
l should go. l'm sorry.

421
00:42:55,967 --> 00:42:59,403
Do you have anyone to stay with you?
lt's not a good idea for you to be alone.

422
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:01,319
- l'll be fine.
- Oh, Grace, wait!

423
00:43:09,127 --> 00:43:10,924
l could use some company.

424
00:43:13,807 --> 00:43:15,399
[Jennings groans]

425
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,358
[in German]

426
00:43:42,567 --> 00:43:43,966
[Jennings grunts]

427
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:55,122
[O'Leary] Sir!

428
00:43:58,047 --> 00:43:59,400
[in German]

429
00:44:01,607 --> 00:44:03,484
Let's try this way.

430
00:44:03,647 --> 00:44:05,126
[flare crackles]

431
00:44:06,087 --> 00:44:07,281
Get down.

432
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:23,959
We need to get into cover.

433
00:44:25,647 --> 00:44:26,966
[O'Leary] Hold tight, sir.

434
00:44:28,487 --> 00:44:31,399
[Jennings grunts]

435
00:44:56,087 --> 00:44:58,442
l think... l'm in trouble.

436
00:44:59,687 --> 00:45:02,121
O'Leary, give me your rifle.

437
00:45:07,327 --> 00:45:09,045
Do you think you can get the other sling?

438
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,402
Yes, sir.

439
00:45:16,407 --> 00:45:19,240
All right. Off you go, boy. Be quick.

440
00:45:37,247 --> 00:45:38,646
[Jennings groans]

441
00:45:41,887 --> 00:45:43,320
Sir?

442
00:45:44,847 --> 00:45:47,281
What time are the big boys gonna light up?

443
00:45:50,607 --> 00:45:53,246
You might be able to fool the boy,
but l've seen that look before.

444
00:45:57,487 --> 00:45:58,476
21 :00.

445
00:45:59,807 --> 00:46:01,206
[Jennings sighs]

446
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:02,925
We don't have much time.

447
00:46:05,407 --> 00:46:06,681
What did you tell him?

448
00:46:07,647 --> 00:46:09,285
[Wilkins] He's got enough to worry about.

449
00:46:11,407 --> 00:46:12,760
[Jennings] Poor boy.

450
00:46:14,407 --> 00:46:16,045
Poor boy?

451
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:20,359
You know, l found him face-first in the mud
hiding like a coward.

452
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:23,246
He'd sooner make a run for it
than to stay here and help you.

453
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:27,119
Don't be too hard on him, sir.

454
00:46:30,247 --> 00:46:34,525
l don't remember any of us being
particularly brave when we first got here.

455
00:46:39,607 --> 00:46:40,801
Well...

456
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,475
He could have stayed out there,

457
00:46:44,647 --> 00:46:46,285
but he's here with us.

458
00:46:47,047 --> 00:46:49,356
That's got to count for something.

459
00:46:50,527 --> 00:46:51,721
Besides...

460
00:46:54,047 --> 00:46:55,924
...he's just a boy.

461
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,286
[grunts]

462
00:47:05,767 --> 00:47:06,756
[whispers] Here you go, sir.

463
00:47:09,087 --> 00:47:11,760
Good job, O'Leary. Well done.

464
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:15,675
[coughs]

465
00:47:15,847 --> 00:47:19,601
- You look ridiculous!
- l figure it's better than no helmet at all.

466
00:47:25,007 --> 00:47:27,726
All right.
l have to try to slow this bleeding.

467
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:37,602
Are you ready?

468
00:47:38,967 --> 00:47:40,446
All right.

469
00:47:46,407 --> 00:47:48,159
[Jennings screams]

470
00:47:48,327 --> 00:47:49,396
Keep it down.

471
00:47:52,687 --> 00:47:54,723
[flare crackles]

472
00:47:58,647 --> 00:48:00,046
[Jennings pants]

473
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:17,359
[in German]

474
00:48:31,127 --> 00:48:32,401
[they cock guns]

475
00:48:43,927 --> 00:48:44,996
[shouts in German]

476
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:48,161
[Jennings groans]

477
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:51,601
Come on! Faster!

478
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:53,996
[O'Leary groans]

479
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:56,158
[Wilkins] O'Leary! O'Leary!

480
00:49:09,567 --> 00:49:10,682
[Jennings grunts]

481
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:13,441
Are you all right, Rich? Yeah?

482
00:49:23,407 --> 00:49:25,204
Come on! Come on!

483
00:49:31,487 --> 00:49:33,125

484
00:49:36,487 --> 00:49:38,955

[cocks gun]

487
00:49:50,727 --> 00:49:54,242
Well, that's it. lt's all over.

488
00:49:56,807 --> 00:49:59,799
l'm going to get a serious rash
if l stay in these wet trousers.

489
00:50:03,847 --> 00:50:05,519
[laughs]

490
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:11,356
How's the leg?

491
00:50:12,247 --> 00:50:13,566
l'll live, sir.

492
00:50:13,727 --> 00:50:15,797
lt's just a flesh wound.

493
00:50:34,007 --> 00:50:36,567
Just being able to talk about this without
someone looking down their nose at me is...

494
00:50:36,727 --> 00:50:38,843
...nice.

495
00:50:42,727 --> 00:50:44,843
l've seen what an unwanted child
can do to a family.

496
00:50:47,727 --> 00:50:49,160
My sister.

497
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:53,515
Father only saw the shame Millie
brought down on the family.

498
00:50:56,847 --> 00:50:58,360
Did you... help her?

499
00:51:02,087 --> 00:51:03,361
No!

500
00:51:04,607 --> 00:51:06,962
She had the baby.

501
00:51:07,127 --> 00:51:09,243
He lives with a nice family in Surrey
last l heard.

502
00:51:18,687 --> 00:51:19,676
Grace...

503
00:51:21,167 --> 00:51:24,239
...l know why you came to see Dr Bennett.

504
00:51:24,807 --> 00:51:29,403
l've seen how these procedures work
and l strongly urge you to reconsider.

505
00:51:31,007 --> 00:51:34,079
So l can suffer the same shame
as your sister?

506
00:51:41,887 --> 00:51:44,640
Sometimes Millie
cries herself to sleep at night,

507
00:51:44,807 --> 00:51:47,958
wondering what he looks like,
what sort of man he'll grow up to be.

508
00:51:48,727 --> 00:51:50,524
- But at least...
- l've made my decision, Eve.

509
00:51:53,807 --> 00:51:55,126
Well...

510
00:51:58,727 --> 00:52:00,160
l'm sorry to hear that.

511
00:52:12,207 --> 00:52:14,004
You've seen these procedures.

512
00:52:16,247 --> 00:52:17,441
You said it yourself.

513
00:52:18,607 --> 00:52:20,438
- No, Grace.
- Eve, please.

514
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,926
You have to do this for me.

515
00:52:22,087 --> 00:52:25,443
l'm not a doctor. l'm not trained for this.

516
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:28,603
There's no one else.

517
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:34,324
l know what l'm asking of you.

518
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:38,918
But this isn't about me.

519
00:52:41,567 --> 00:52:45,003
l couldn't bear it if Arthur arrived home
to more pain than he endured out there.

520
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:48,557
And how much pain would you cause him
if you were to die?

521
00:52:55,887 --> 00:52:58,447
Would your fiance still have you

522
00:52:58,607 --> 00:53:00,996
if you were carrying another man's child?

523
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:15,839
Do you have a picture of him?

524
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:19,240
Your husband?

525
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:38,803
l hope he's worth it, Grace.

526
00:54:06,247 --> 00:54:08,397
That's a hell of a thing you did for me, sir.

527
00:54:08,567 --> 00:54:11,035
All three of us
are getting out of here, Private.

528
00:54:12,247 --> 00:54:13,396
Aye, sir.

529
00:54:19,927 --> 00:54:21,155
Sir, l mean no disrespect,

530
00:54:21,327 --> 00:54:23,841
but l can't help thinking
there's something you're not telling me.

531
00:54:24,007 --> 00:54:25,804
And what makes you say that?

532
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:29,476
Every chance you get
you're looking at your watch.

533
00:54:34,567 --> 00:54:36,364
Whatever it is, l can handle it.

534
00:54:38,087 --> 00:54:39,600
Tell him, Arthur.

535
00:54:50,767 --> 00:54:52,325
All right, then.

536
00:54:53,767 --> 00:54:56,076
We failed in taking the trenches back.

537
00:54:57,287 --> 00:55:00,836
So at 21 :00 hours, the big boys
will be smashing these lines again.

538
00:55:01,407 --> 00:55:02,396
Hard.

539
00:55:03,447 --> 00:55:05,039
21 :00?

540
00:55:06,127 --> 00:55:07,685
20 minutes.

541
00:55:10,767 --> 00:55:12,837
We're close, sir. We can make it.

542
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:16,039
There's a medic's kit caught
in the barbed wire not ten yards away.

543
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,320
lf we can patch him up,
we might have a chance.

544
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,639
All right. lt's worth a shot.

545
00:55:26,167 --> 00:55:27,885
Cover me.

546
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:35,396
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

547
00:55:35,567 --> 00:55:36,966
All right.

548
00:55:37,127 --> 00:55:38,526
[cocks gun]

549
00:55:59,207 --> 00:56:02,165

Sir?

561
00:58:49,207 --> 00:58:51,562
Our boys must know we're out here, right?

562
00:58:51,727 --> 00:58:52,876
They'll stop the bombing.

563
00:58:53,047 --> 00:58:55,686
l mean... they'll have to.

564
00:58:57,207 --> 00:58:59,038
l think it's safe to assume
they have no idea.

565
00:59:00,367 --> 00:59:03,245
When the bombardment starts,
we'll make a run for it.

566
00:59:03,407 --> 00:59:06,444
l think he'll have a better chance
of making it if we stick together.

Sir...

568
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,440
He'll make it.

569
00:59:16,007 --> 00:59:17,998
What if it were Frankie lying here, sir?

570
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,838
Would you still be risking our lives for him?

571
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:27,563
You think because the man
has his eyes closed he can't hear you?

572
00:59:28,487 --> 00:59:30,876
He's 100 times the man you are!

573
00:59:31,647 --> 00:59:35,117
The only reason he's here dying
is because he had the courage to do his duty.

574
00:59:36,367 --> 00:59:37,686
The man was...

575
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:48,836
The man is a hero

but we're running out of time.

579
01:00:06,767 --> 01:00:08,405
And if what you're saying is true,

580
01:00:08,567 --> 01:00:10,956
that no one knows we're out here,

581
01:00:11,127 --> 01:00:14,005
then when the big boys
blast this place to hell,

582
01:00:14,167 --> 01:00:16,123
we'll all be dead in seconds.

583

[WiIkins] My dearest Grace...

01:28:22,927 --> 01:28:25,600
...it's a strange fate
that brings me home to you.

Yet denies the reunion I've so Ionged for...

794
01:28:32,567 --> 01:28:34,478
...and equaIIy feared.

795
01:29:03,927 --> 01:29:06,680
A close friend reminded me recently that...

796
01:29:08,047 --> 01:29:11,642
...a faintest memory
is enough to give you hope.

797

...l can't begin to describe the horrors
that l've seen.

But that's not an excuse.

802
01:29:42,047 --> 01:29:44,959
Not for my absence
when you needed me the most.

803
01:29:49,927 --> 01:29:51,645
Well, l've...

804

l've learned a lot about myself
these past months.

805

The hardest lesson to come to terms with...

806
01:30:02,207 --> 01:30:04,277
...is why l lost you.
