1
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,600
Stupid kids.
Move it.

2
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,360
You go ahead.
I'll make my own way.

3
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,200
- Get back in the car.
- Just go.

4
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,560
Hurry up.

5
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,640
Petrit, I don't want to crash.
I only just got this bike.

6
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,320
Come on.
We don't want to be late.

7
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,280
Petrit, we shouldn't
even be here.

8
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,520
Just keep your mouth shut
and stay out of sight.

9
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,040
Let me do what I do.

10
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,280
Boy.

11
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
What do you want?

12
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,480
I'm Petrit.

13
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
Oh, you're Petrit.

14
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,280
Well?

15
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
These are for you.

16
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,680
Good boy.

17
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,120
Good.

18
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,080
Now go. Quickly.

19
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,080
Cheers.

20
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,360
Petrit, I want to go now.

21
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,560
This is for you.

22
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,040
What's that for?

23
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
For letting me borrow
your bicycle.

24
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,720
Come on.

25
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,400
Do you want to stay over?

26
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,760
Come on. It will be fun.

27
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,120
We can ride to school tomorrow.

28
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,360
Hundreds of tanks,

29
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,640
trucks and buses
full of Serbian forces...

30
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,600
Where have you been?

31
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,760
For a bike ride.

32
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,120
Oki bought a bike.

33
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,560
Tell him.

34
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,560
It's true. I've been selling
almonds. It took me a year to save up.

35
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,760
Leave them be.

36
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,240
But they must be back
before the curfew.

37
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
You can't be seen on the streets
at this hour.

38
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,640
Understand?

39
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,200
Is Oki staying for dinner?

40
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,440
Actually,
he's going to stay over tonight.

41
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,360
Then we can ride to
school together.

42
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,080
As long as his family knows.

43
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,280
..where many people have been
killed and massacred...

44
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,120
I've got another meeting
after school.

45
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,600
Are you coming with me?

46
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,440
I'll pay you.

47
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,640
I don't know.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,160
It's not safe.

49
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,800
It's fine. They are my friends.

50
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,800
Plus they need me.

51
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,400
Supply and demand.
It's business.

52
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,560
And in a few weeks,
I'll be able to buy my own bike.

53
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,640
You can't trust them.

54
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,360
You have heard the stories.

55
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Remember what happened to Nehat?

56
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,280
Let me show you something.

57
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,240
What is it?

58
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
Open it.

59
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,560
See, I told you you're
safe with me.

60
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,360
With Luli i Vocerr he shows the
misery of the Albanians.

61
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,200
Are you coming, then?

62
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,480
OK.

63
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,760
I'll see you later, yeah?

64
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,120
Yes?

65
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,520
- We're looking for Dragan.
- Dragan?

66
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,160
Let him through.

67
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,400
You brought a friend, I see.

68
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,480
He's my business partner.

69
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,680
Partner? Really?

70
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,400
Leave.

71
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,760
Hey, partner.

72
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,360
That's a nice bicycle.

73
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Thank you.

74
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,360
Look at me when I'm
talking, boy.

75
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,400
My nephew would like a bicycle.

76
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,520
What I want to know is why Albanian
scum are riding around on a bike

77
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,360
while my Serbian nephew
has to go without.

78
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,640
Is this justice?

79
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Well?

80
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
Oki.

81
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,200
Give him your bicycle.

82
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,720
I'm sorry, Oki.

83
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,760
There was nothing I could do.

84
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,680
- I'll buy you a new one.
- I don't want anything from you.

85
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,440
Especially something bought
with money from them.

86
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,240
What will my family say?

87
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,240
They will be so ashamed.

88
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,760
We can make an excuse
about the bike.

89
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,720
Not about the bike!

90
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,600
It's not about the bike.
Understand?

91
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,040
It's that we've been
dealing with them.

92
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,360
You're no businessman.

93
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
You're a coward,

94
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
you're a liar,

95
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,160
but most of all,

96
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,600
you're a traitor.

97
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,040
I'm sorry, Oki.

98
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,560
How many times can I say it?

99
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,440
Please, it's been days now.

100
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,360
Cut the engine.

101
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,760
You. Both of you.

102
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,400
Boy, get out.

103
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,160
Out. Out.

104
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,280
What's this?

105
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,760
Take it and get out.

106
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,240
Quickly.

107
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,360
What are you looking at?

108
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,440
Get out.

109
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,280
Hurry up.

110
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,720
- Come on.
- Hurry.

111
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,120
Give it to me.

112
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,640
What are these?

113
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,120
You're carrying Kosovan books?

114
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,680
You're learning in Albanian?

115
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,360
This land is not part
of Albania.

116
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,680
Understand? This is Serbia.

117
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,080
- How dare you look at me!
- Wait!

118
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,480
They are my books.

119
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,120
What?

120
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,040
- They are mine.
- Silence!

121
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,120
Him.

122
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,000
Tomorrow, I want to see Serbian
books and hear you sing in Serbian!

123
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,760
You, come on!

124
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,600
Come on!

125
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,440
What are you doing here?

126
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,440
I came to say thanks.

127
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,960
You didn't need to do that.

128
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,680
Yes, I did.

129
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,080
You were right.

130
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,280
I can't trust them.

131
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,080
I'm not going to sell any more.

132
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,440
To them I'll always be
"Albanian scum".

133
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,000
Plus I don't really need a bike.

134
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,240
Me neither.

135
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,960
Do you want to stay over?

136
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,000
Mum is making a Pita.

137
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,520
Yeah.

138
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,160
Stay there. Don't move!

139
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,680
Come on! Come on!

140
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,760
Get out!

141
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,120
Come on!

142
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,280
Quickly! Move!

143
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,320
Where shall we start?

144
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,600
With the boy, I think.

145
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
Boy, step forward.

146
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,400
Boy.

147
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,400
Do you want to save him?

148
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,480
You want to save him?

149
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,440
Enough!

150
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,160
That's enough.

151
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,720
Enough.

152
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,520
Well?

153
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,400
This is not your country.

154
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,720
Take your possessions.

155
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,440
Leave and do not look back.

156
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
If you look back...

157
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,000
..we will kill you.

158
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,600
Is that clear?

159
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,080
Motherfuckers.

160
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,320
Go.

161
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
Go.

162
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:33,800
Go.
