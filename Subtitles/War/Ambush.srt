Hogfield, you go to the left

26
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:18,882  X1:269 X2:449 Y1:450 Y2:492
Time to go.

00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:48,002  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:492
Tell him l'm for sale. His price.

46
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:06,691  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:450 Y2:492
Hello, Mrs. McCoy.

48
00:09:19,653 --> 00:09:21,006  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:492
Class. ls she a regular?

49
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:25,125  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:492
Jeez, is that Carol Ainsley?

50
00:09:25,213 --> 00:09:26,487  X1:289 X2:430 Y1:450 Y2:492

Mr. Beynon.

53
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:46,289  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:450 Y2:492
So the good doctor comes up again.

54
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:53,768  X1:309 X2:410 Y1:450 Y2:492
Why?

55
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:56,848  X1:273 X2:446 Y1:450 Y2:492
Can l help?

56
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,326  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:450 Y2:487
How about a drink?

57
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:10,011  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:450 Y2:490
Yeah, l could use one.

58
00:10:11,013 --> 00:10:12,207  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:450 Y2:487
Come on over.

59
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:35,572  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:450 Y2:490
You'll be back, Doc.

60
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:09,446  X1:289 X2:429 Y1:450 Y2:518
-Hi, Doc.
-Hi.

61
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:12,688  X1:277 X2:442 Y1:450 Y2:492
Feel okay?

62
00:12:13,253 --> 00:12:15,926  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:523

than l was an hour ago.

63
00:12:18,493 --> 00:12:21,405  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:450 Y2:523
-You want to drive?
-My driver's license has expired.

64
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:33,291  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:450 Y2:518
-You feel good?
-Yeah.

65
00:15:56,973 --> 00:15:58,042  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:450 Y2:492
You okay?

66
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,561  X1:265 X2:454 Y1:450 Y2:492
Pretty good.

67
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,802  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:450 Y2:523
Made a trip to Oregon
to see my brother and his kids.

68
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:05,724  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:518
l figured it'd be
the last time l'd see them...

69
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:10,848  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:450 Y2:487
Fatter.

70
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:14,883  X1:096 X2:623 Y1:450 Y2:492
You know, some things never change.

71
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:17,966  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:450 Y2:492
Yeah, that's right.

72
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:21,806  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:450 Y2:487
That's not all of it.

73
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,651  X1:173 X2:545 Y1:450 Y2:492
lt's been a long time, Doc.

74
00:16:27,013 --> 00:16:28,492  X1:202 X2:516 Y1:450 Y2:492
Did you go out much?

75
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:32,607  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:523
Four years, and now
the question comes up.

76
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:44,524  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:450 Y2:487
l couldn't handle it inside.

77
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:26,283  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:450 Y2:492
lt does something to you, you know.

78
00:18:27,613 --> 00:18:29,251  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:450 Y2:492
lt does something to you.

79
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:55,208  X1:299 X2:420 Y1:450 Y2:492
Really?

80
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:56,607  X1:301 X2:417 Y1:450 Y2:492
Really.

81
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,083  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:450 Y2:492
Let me make you feel good, Doctor.

82
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:15,005  X1:233 X2:486 Y1:450 Y2:492
lt's been so long.

83
00:19:39,453 --> 00:19:40,602  X1:281 X2:437 Y1:450 Y2:487
Fantastic.

84
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,051  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:450 Y2:492
Hey, l was gonna fix you breakfast.

85
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:54,452  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:450 Y2:492
You were sleeping.

86
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:55,886  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:450 Y2:492
A little ketchup.

87
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:02,524  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:450 Y2:487
And then we have a little....

88
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:15,884  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:450 Y2:523
-For what?
-For getting me out.

89
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:19,692  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:450 Y2:492
lt was a pleasure.

90
00:20:29,693 --> 00:20:31,012  X1:221 X2:498 Y1:450 Y2:492
Thank you, ma'am.

91
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,801  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:450 Y2:492
Hey, Claude. Here's your boy.

92
00:20:47,973 --> 00:20:49,406  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:492
You have to be kidding.

93
00:20:49,493 --> 00:20:52,610  X1:117 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:523
Not at all.
Just a pleasant way to have lunch.

94
00:20:53,173 --> 00:20:54,242  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:450 Y2:487
Sit down.

95
00:20:56,973 --> 00:20:59,282  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:450 Y2:518
lt's good to see you
in them civilian clothes.

96
00:20:59,373 --> 00:21:01,409  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:492
lt just takes a long arm, Beynon.

97
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:06,211  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:523
You know, it's hard to say
how those things happen.

98
00:21:07,453 --> 00:21:10,365  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:450 Y2:523
The parole board almost never
changes their decision.

99
00:21:11,373 --> 00:21:13,762  X1:077 X2:641 Y1:450 Y2:492
lt must be because l'm a model prisoner.

100
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,245  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:450 Y2:492
Any business with me...

101
00:21:26,373 --> 00:21:28,284  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:450 Y2:492
Back with your own people, now.

102
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:32,684  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:450 Y2:492
l'll get my own men, Beynon.

103
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,893  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:450 Y2:492
You run the job, but l run the show.

104
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,766  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:450 Y2:492
And don't forget it.

105
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:47,323  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:492
You've got two weeks to set it up.

106
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:52,292  X1:099 X2:620 Y1:450 Y2:523
lt's not a big bank, but it handles
the cash deposits for an oil company.

107
00:21:53,253 --> 00:21:55,084  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:487
Over half a million dollars.

108
00:21:56,213 --> 00:21:57,646  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:450 Y2:492
lt's a family bank.

109
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:03,009  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:450 Y2:523
...is on the board of directors
at Con-Sol Oil in Beacon City.

110
00:22:14,213 --> 00:22:15,965  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:492
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson.

111
00:22:22,053 --> 00:22:23,691  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:450 Y2:492

112
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:25,286  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:450 Y2:487

113
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:27,571  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:490
You're out of touch, Doc.

114
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,526  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:450 Y2:492
Miller got blown up.

115
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:33,762  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:450 Y2:487

117
00:22:36,853 --> 00:22:38,491  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:450 Y2:518
-Were you with him?
-Yeah.

118
00:22:43,093 --> 00:22:44,128  X1:312 X2:406 Y1:450 Y2:487
You?

119
00:22:44,893 --> 00:22:46,963  X1:117 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:492

123
00:22:58,613 --> 00:23:00,126  X1:237 X2:482 Y1:450 Y2:492
They'll be ready.

124
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:02,605  X1:172 X2:546 Y1:450 Y2:492
You boys just do your job.

125
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,642  X1:277 X2:442 Y1:450 Y2:492
He's early.

126
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,161  X1:072 X2:647 Y1:450 Y2:492
You got a flashlight, some light batteries.

127
00:23:26,853 --> 00:23:29,413  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:450 Y2:492
A-hooks, pliers, wire cutters....

128
00:23:34,293 --> 00:23:36,443  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:450 Y2:492
What do you want all this stuff for?

129
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:41,366  X1:269 X2:450 Y1:450 Y2:492
Well...okay.

130
00:23:47,813 --> 00:23:51,488  X1:135 X2:583 Y1:450 Y2:524
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
especially you gentlemen....

131
00:23:51,813 --> 00:23:55,931  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:524
We very proudly present
the pride andjoy of Beacon City.

132
00:23:56,213 --> 00:23:59,125  X1:073 X2:646 Y1:450 Y2:493
Our own high-stepping and high-kicking...

133
00:23:59,213 --> 00:24:01,283  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:450 Y2:493
...Southwest Texas Ropers.

134
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:27,242  X1:096 X2:622 Y1:450 Y2:524
Following the strutters...

135
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:31,451  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:518
...the Volunteer Fire Brigade.
We have the first beautiful float...

136
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:35,885  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:450 Y2:524
...which consists of the Constitution
in the history of the Lone Star State.

137
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:54,889  X1:143 X2:576 Y1:450 Y2:523
l'd like an application
for a checking account, please.

138
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:58,648  X1:085 X2:634 Y1:450 Y2:523
He goes here, follows down here.
Now, this is the spot you're looking for.

139
00:24:58,733 --> 00:24:59,927  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:450 Y2:487
Here. Yeah.

140
00:25:11,373 --> 00:25:13,250  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:450 Y2:518
-Thanks a lot.
-You're welcome.

141
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:36,131  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:450 Y2:494
Change for a $50, please.

142
00:25:41,293 --> 00:25:43,124  X1:279 X2:440 Y1:450 Y2:492
$20, $30...

143
00:25:43,853 --> 00:25:46,447  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:450 Y2:492
...$40, $45, $50.

144
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,447  X1:088 X2:631 Y1:450 Y2:523
The diversionary explosions are spaced
20 seconds apart.

145
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:03,886  X1:236 X2:482 Y1:450 Y2:492
That gives you...

146
00:26:10,213 --> 00:26:13,125  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:523
You've got a bank president,
you have three tellers.

147
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:16,012  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:450 Y2:492
And you've got a bank guard.

148
00:26:16,093 --> 00:26:17,367  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:492
Usually on the right as you come in.

149
00:26:17,453 --> 00:26:18,886  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:450 Y2:492
Pin him right away.

150
00:26:26,493 --> 00:26:29,485  X1:083 X2:635 Y1:450 Y2:518
Shouldn't be anywhere near the vicinity
when we make our hit.

151
00:26:29,573 --> 00:26:31,564  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:450 Y2:492
Traffic is usually light at that hour.

152
00:26:34,853 --> 00:26:36,445  X1:162 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:492
...and then there's the alley.

153
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:38,967  X1:071 X2:647 Y1:450 Y2:492
Will you put that away and pay attention!

154
00:26:42,493 --> 00:26:44,324  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:450 Y2:492
Now the guard carries a .38.

155
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:49,211  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:492
The cops carry 357*-magnums.

156
00:26:52,733 --> 00:26:54,291  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:450 Y2:487
You know what this is.

157
00:27:01,173 --> 00:27:03,562  X1:077 X2:641 Y1:450 Y2:492
l've been working ten years without one.

158
00:27:08,453 --> 00:27:09,647  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:450 Y2:487
What about the vault?

159
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:10,927  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:450 Y2:492
lt's a Chambers Reilly.

160
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:17,766  X1:135 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:518
No, one-inch stuff
on a three number combination.

161
00:27:17,893 --> 00:27:19,008  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:450 Y2:487
That's me.

162
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:22,769  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:450 Y2:523
No, no. l'll handle the fine stuff.
You're backup all the way.

163
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:25,885  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:450 Y2:492
Whatever you need, brother.

164
00:27:26,653 --> 00:27:27,722  X1:306 X2:412 Y1:450 Y2:492
Right.

165
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:33,650  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:450 Y2:523
You keep going over this.
l don't want anybody lost.

166
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:36,927  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:450 Y2:518
lf we're clean,
Gollie will take us across at Laredo.

167
00:27:44,293 --> 00:27:46,363  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:492
Aren't we going a little bit hard?

168
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:55,487  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:450 Y2:492
A piece of cake.

169
00:27:57,573 --> 00:28:00,133  X1:064 X2:655 Y1:450 Y2:492
You don't have to be Dillinger for that one.

170
00:28:17,893 --> 00:28:19,406  X1:221 X2:498 Y1:450 Y2:492
Dillinger got killed.

171
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:23,812  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:450 Y2:487
Not in the bank.

172
00:28:27,613 --> 00:28:29,012  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:450 Y2:492
Take it with you.

173
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:50,202  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:450 Y2:492
Expenses.

174
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:03,047  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:518
And his people better be there.
All of them.

175
00:29:05,373 --> 00:29:06,362  X1:259 X2:460 Y1:450 Y2:487
l understand.

176
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,647  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:450 Y2:492
Beynon's to be alone at the drop.

177
00:29:07,733 --> 00:29:10,611  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:450 Y2:518
Only one car in the garage
at the ranch and that's it.

178
00:29:10,693 --> 00:29:12,126  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:450 Y2:492
Now, l'm not gonna have the money.

179
00:29:16,813 --> 00:29:18,565  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:450 Y2:523
-He understands.
-Good, good.

180
00:29:18,653 --> 00:29:20,848  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:450 Y2:492
Make sure everybody does. Okay?

181
00:30:17,053 --> 00:30:18,884  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:450 Y2:492
Good morning.

182
00:30:19,813 --> 00:30:20,962  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:450 Y2:492
Good morning.

183
00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:30,282  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:450 Y2:492
Good morning.

184
00:30:33,413 --> 00:30:35,722  X1:065 X2:653 Y1:450 Y2:492
Good morning, Mr. Morgan. How are you?

185
00:30:35,813 --> 00:30:37,087  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:450 Y2:492
Fine, thank you.

186
00:31:44,053 --> 00:31:45,042  X1:297 X2:421 Y1:450 Y2:487
Hold it.

187
00:32:06,693 --> 00:32:08,012  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:450 Y2:490
Come on, move it!

188
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:44,128  X1:305 X2:413 Y1:450 Y2:487
Relax.

189
00:33:00,373 --> 00:33:02,682  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:450 Y2:492
Superior technology, my ass.

190
00:33:22,773 --> 00:33:24,411  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:450 Y2:492
Mr. President? Up!

191
00:33:30,173 --> 00:33:31,925  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:450 Y2:492
Everybody, out this way.

192
00:33:36,853 --> 00:33:39,970  X1:069 X2:649 Y1:450 Y2:492
Come on, come on! Hurry it up! Move it!

193
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:15,889  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:450 Y2:492
Now just relax.

194
00:34:16,453 --> 00:34:17,727  X1:271 X2:448 Y1:450 Y2:487
Face down!

195
00:34:34,253 --> 00:34:36,289  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:450 Y2:492
Move it. Move it, honey.

196
00:34:38,573 --> 00:34:40,768  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:450 Y2:492
They're on their way. Just relax.

197
00:35:33,533 --> 00:35:34,727  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:450 Y2:492
Ninety seconds.

198
00:35:59,653 --> 00:36:00,608  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:450 Y2:492
Seventy-five.

199
00:36:05,653 --> 00:36:06,768  X1:279 X2:440 Y1:450 Y2:492
Sixty-five.

200
00:36:10,013 --> 00:36:11,241  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:450 Y2:492
Fifty, brother.

201
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:23,969  X1:322 X2:397 Y1:450 Y2:487
No!

202
00:36:24,293 --> 00:36:25,169  X1:322 X2:397 Y1:450 Y2:487
No!

203
00:36:33,413 --> 00:36:34,641  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:450 Y2:492
Stupid bastard!

204
00:36:53,613 --> 00:36:54,841  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:450 Y2:487
Take the wheel.

205
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:56,521  X1:241 X2:478 Y1:450 Y2:487
Take the wheel.

206
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,682  X1:250 X2:468 Y1:450 Y2:492
How did it go?

207
00:37:39,413 --> 00:37:41,324  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:450 Y2:490
Come on, come on.

208
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:35,168  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:450 Y2:487
Shit.

209
00:40:07,453 --> 00:40:08,727  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:450 Y2:487
Where's Jackson?

210
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:11,572  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:450 Y2:487
He didn't make it.

211
00:40:12,053 --> 00:40:13,406  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:450 Y2:492
Neither did you.

212
00:41:58,613 --> 00:42:01,173  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:450 Y2:523

213
00:42:05,813 --> 00:42:06,802  X1:145 X2:574 Y1:450 Y2:493
...who forced the employees....

214
00:42:06,893 --> 00:42:08,849  X1:137 X2:581 Y1:450 Y2:494
Hey, there's only $500,000 here.

215
00:42:13,933 --> 00:42:14,843  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:450 Y2:487
Doc?

l see it. Take it easy.

217
00:42:41,213 --> 00:42:42,441  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:450 Y2:492
Okay, drive on.

219
00:43:16,373 --> 00:43:17,886  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:450 Y2:487

220
00:43:25,413 --> 00:43:26,448  X1:293 X2:426 Y1:450 Y2:487
He's on.

222
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,688  X1:305 X2:413 Y1:450 Y2:487
Yeah?

223
00:43:33,173 --> 00:43:34,083  X1:305 X2:414 Y1:450 Y2:487
Yeah?

224
00:43:35,733 --> 00:43:36,768  X1:287 X2:431 Y1:450 Y2:487
l'm here.

225
00:44:05,653 --> 00:44:07,371  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:450 Y2:492
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.

226
00:44:07,453 --> 00:44:09,045  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:450 Y2:487
l've never been there.

227
00:44:10,053 --> 00:44:12,089  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:490
When we met, it was at his office.

228
00:44:30,213 --> 00:44:32,602  X1:069 X2:650 Y1:450 Y2:492
lf we make a mistake, he's gonna burn us.

229
00:44:35,653 --> 00:44:37,371  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:492
l don't want to go there.

230
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:40,766  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:450 Y2:492
Let's do it my way.

231
00:45:20,973 --> 00:45:23,043  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:450 Y2:492
l'll wrap it up as quick as l can.

232
00:46:05,093 --> 00:46:06,924  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:450 Y2:492
News said two people killed.

233
00:46:07,093 --> 00:46:09,402  X1:163 X2:556 Y1:450 Y2:492
Three. Rudy got ambitious.

234
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:11,206  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:450 Y2:492
And you got him.

235
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:13,482  X1:265 X2:454 Y1:450 Y2:492
That's right.

236
00:46:13,573 --> 00:46:15,165  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:450 Y2:492
What about your wife?

237
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,167  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:450 Y2:492
Let's cut up the money, Beynon.

238
00:46:20,093 --> 00:46:22,243  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:450 Y2:492
She told me no one would get killed.

239
00:46:33,733 --> 00:46:36,122  X1:092 X2:626 Y1:450 Y2:492
You still don't get the picture, do you?

240
00:46:36,933 --> 00:46:39,970  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:450 Y2:523
And l've always heard
what a smart-ass operator you was.

241
00:46:40,293 --> 00:46:41,487  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:450 Y2:492
No applause.

242
00:46:47,733 --> 00:46:50,486  X1:095 X2:624 Y1:450 Y2:492
One. An extremely attractive woman.

243
00:46:57,373 --> 00:46:59,329  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:487
And there's the woman's husband.

244
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:05,366  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:450 Y2:518
A man who can easily get a parole
for a convict.

245
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:07,812  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:450 Y2:492
Why should he?

246
00:47:08,173 --> 00:47:09,686  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:450 Y2:492
A simple reason, McCoy.

247
00:47:09,773 --> 00:47:11,331  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:450 Y2:492
Let's get down to it.

248
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:13,728  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:450 Y2:494
Radio's rapping about $7*50,000.

249
00:47:14,453 --> 00:47:16,409  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:450 Y2:490
There's a half a million, here.

250
00:47:18,373 --> 00:47:20,443  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:450 Y2:487
A little more was taken out before.

251
00:47:21,173 --> 00:47:23,892  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:450 Y2:518
You see, my brother's
the director of that bank.

252
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,567  X1:061 X2:658 Y1:450 Y2:492
We had a few problems we had to iron out.

253
00:47:29,493 --> 00:47:31,370  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:450 Y2:492
Okay. We covered you....

254
00:47:34,213 --> 00:47:35,726  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:450 Y2:492
You surely did, Doc.

255
00:47:42,733 --> 00:47:45,406  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:450 Y2:523
My old lady must've made you
a lot of promises.

256
00:47:46,413 --> 00:47:47,402  X1:305 X2:414 Y1:450 Y2:487
Close.

257
00:49:57,973 --> 00:49:58,928  X1:297 X2:421 Y1:450 Y2:492
Stupid!

258
00:50:02,053 --> 00:50:03,611  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:450 Y2:492
Why didn't you tell me?

259
00:50:22,893 --> 00:50:24,929  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:450 Y2:492
What the hell do you want anyway?

260
00:51:10,253 --> 00:51:11,606  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:450 Y2:492
Something's wrong.

261
00:51:20,933 --> 00:51:22,332  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:450 Y2:492
What's the damage?

262
00:51:24,613 --> 00:51:26,922  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:450 Y2:518
Your collarbone's broken
but it's not shattered.

263
00:51:27,013 --> 00:51:28,731  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:450 Y2:492
There's no infection, yet.

264
00:51:32,613 --> 00:51:33,762  X1:285 X2:433 Y1:450 Y2:492
lt's okay.

265
00:51:47,293 --> 00:51:49,249  X1:181 X2:538 Y1:450 Y2:487
We...we can't leave here.

266
00:51:51,573 --> 00:51:54,326  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:450 Y2:521
That's not possible.
l mean, we have all of this.

267
00:51:58,133 --> 00:52:00,089  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:450 Y2:492
ls that possible, Mrs. Clinton?

268
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:04,050  X1:165 X2:554 Y1:450 Y2:492
Just tell us what you want.

269
00:52:10,613 --> 00:52:12,331  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:492
What kind of a car do you drive?

270
00:52:12,413 --> 00:52:14,085  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:450 Y2:487
A Ford. We have a Ford.

271
00:52:19,093 --> 00:52:20,287  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:450 Y2:492
That's good.

272
00:52:24,973 --> 00:52:27,123  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:450 Y2:492
You run on out and gas up the Ford.

273
00:52:39,373 --> 00:52:41,329  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:450 Y2:492
You do what he says, Harold.

274
00:53:00,813 --> 00:53:02,963  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:450 Y2:487
You. Get a cloth.

275
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:05,486  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:450 Y2:492
You're gonna wash me.

276
00:53:13,813 --> 00:53:16,532  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:450 Y2:523
What about El Paso?
He's a friend of Laughlin.

277
00:53:18,453 --> 00:53:20,444  X1:082 X2:637 Y1:450 Y2:523
We've got to get somebody down there.
Either Rudy or...

278
00:53:20,533 --> 00:53:22,808  X1:105 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:492
...McCoy's got a half a million bucks.

279
00:53:26,933 --> 00:53:29,322  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:523
Just dump him down a dry well,
if you can find one.

280
00:53:29,413 --> 00:53:31,449  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:492
No, he ought to be buried proper.

281
00:53:32,773 --> 00:53:34,604  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:492
You just do what l tell you.

282
00:53:37,413 --> 00:53:38,766  X1:221 X2:498 Y1:450 Y2:492
Thank you, ma'am.

283
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:44,132  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:450 Y2:492
Wendy, sit down.

284
00:54:55,773 --> 00:54:57,411  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:450 Y2:492
Kind of tricky, isn't it?

285
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,051  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:450 Y2:518
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

286
00:55:19,133 --> 00:55:20,407  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:450 Y2:487
Come over here.

287
00:55:41,533 --> 00:55:43,285  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:450 Y2:492
l'll do anything you want.

288
00:55:44,573 --> 00:55:45,562  X1:301 X2:417 Y1:450 Y2:492
Really.

289
00:55:46,213 --> 00:55:47,202  X1:308 X2:410 Y1:450 Y2:487
l will.

290
00:55:55,893 --> 00:55:56,769  X1:307 X2:411 Y1:450 Y2:492
Okay.

291
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:58,406  X1:257 X2:461 Y1:450 Y2:487
l don't like it.

292
00:56:10,653 --> 00:56:12,291  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:450 Y2:492
And get rid of that, too.

293
00:56:13,093 --> 00:56:14,242  X1:257 X2:462 Y1:450 Y2:487
What is that?

294
00:56:52,813 --> 00:56:54,246  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:450 Y2:490
No, l'm afraid not.

295
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:55,402  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:450 Y2:487
l'd like another one.

296
00:56:55,493 --> 00:56:56,721  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:450 Y2:490
Me, neither.

297
00:57:00,613 --> 00:57:04,765  X1:077 X2:642 Y1:450 Y2:521
There's about 12 people in the state who
aren't Mormons, and l'm one of them.

298
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:09,642  X1:090 X2:628 Y1:450 Y2:492
l guess that makes you kind of special.

299
00:57:13,733 --> 00:57:14,882  X1:277 X2:442 Y1:450 Y2:492
Hey, baby.

300
00:57:17,373 --> 00:57:19,807  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:523
You wouldn't be taking the train
to Salt Lake, would you?

301
00:57:19,893 --> 00:57:21,372  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:450 Y2:490
No, l'm afraid not!

302
00:57:21,693 --> 00:57:23,012  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:450 Y2:492
That's just my luck.

303
00:57:30,533 --> 00:57:31,727  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:450 Y2:492
Where's the bag?

304
00:57:31,813 --> 00:57:33,610  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:450 Y2:492
lt's in the locker. l've got the key.

305
00:58:11,893 --> 00:58:13,167  X1:249 X2:470 Y1:450 Y2:492
How long ago?

306
00:58:13,893 --> 00:58:15,372  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:450 Y2:492
Fifteen minutes ago.

307
00:58:20,293 --> 00:58:23,808  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:450 Y2:523
lt's the oldest con game in the world.
He switched keys with you.

308
00:58:28,613 --> 00:58:31,446  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:450 Y2:523
He'll figure you for more time.
He's probably still in the station.

309
00:58:31,533 --> 00:58:32,602  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:450 Y2:487
Find him.

310
00:58:58,653 --> 00:59:02,851  X1:063 X2:656 Y1:450 Y2:524
Your attention please. The Lone Star Flyer
for...and El Paso now boarding.

311
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:13,405  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:450 Y2:493
The Lone Star Flyer for...

312
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:28,969  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:450 Y2:523
-There you are, ma'am.
-Thank you.

313
00:59:45,253 --> 00:59:48,290  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:450 Y2:523
You have coach number six.
You've got coach number four.

314
00:59:48,453 --> 00:59:50,171  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:450 Y2:487
You have coach number two.

315
00:59:50,413 --> 00:59:52,290  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:450 Y2:521
-My aunt forgot her bag.
-Yes, sir.

316
00:59:52,373 --> 00:59:53,692  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:450 Y2:487
Coach number six.

317
01:00:00,213 --> 01:00:02,522  X1:153 X2:566 Y1:450 Y2:523
-l'm gonna see somebody off.
-All right.

318
01:00:24,853 --> 01:00:28,402  X1:137 X2:582 Y1:450 Y2:524
Last call for the Lone Star Flyer
now leaving at track site.

319
01:00:41,613 --> 01:00:45,572  X1:094 X2:625 Y1:450 Y2:523
That's awfully heavy. To save my life,
l can't possibly lift it up there.

320
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:47,962  X1:273 X2:446 Y1:450 Y2:492
Thank you.

321
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:50,051  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:450 Y2:487
That's coach number one.

322
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:51,612  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:450 Y2:487
That's coach three.

323
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:12,049  X1:115 X2:604 Y1:450 Y2:492
Car number three, right over there.

324
01:04:02,853 --> 01:04:04,445  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:450 Y2:492
Tickets, please.

325
01:04:52,573 --> 01:04:53,892  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:450 Y2:492
Tickets, please.

326
01:05:19,493 --> 01:05:20,892  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:450 Y2:492
Tickets please.

327
01:05:21,253 --> 01:05:22,845  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:450 Y2:487
Two. End of the line.

328
01:05:26,133 --> 01:05:27,725  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:450 Y2:492
l'll get you.

329
01:05:41,893 --> 01:05:43,246  X1:258 X2:460 Y1:450 Y2:492
Stick 'em up!

330
01:05:45,773 --> 01:05:48,207  X1:096 X2:623 Y1:450 Y2:492

297
00:57:00,613 --> 00:57:04,765  X1:077 X2:642 Y1:450 Y2:521
There's about 12 people in the state who

298
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:09,642  X1:090 X2:628 Y1:450 Y2:492

300
00:57:17,373 --> 00:57:19,807  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:523
You wouldn't be taking the train
to Salt Lake, would you?

301
00:57:19,893 --> 00:57:21,372  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:450 Y2:490

01:09:05,253 --> 01:09:06,766  X1:213 X2:506 Y1:450 Y2:492
Texas is a big state.

357
01:09:06,853 --> 01:09:09,083  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:450 Y2:523

275
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:05,486  X1:191 X2:527 Y1:450 Y2:492

276
00:53:13,813 --> 00:53:16,532  X1:183 X2:536 Y1:450 Y2:523
What about El Paso?
He's a friend of Laughlin.

277
00:53:18,453 --> 00:53:20,444  X1:082 X2:637 Y1:450 Y2:523
We've got to get somebody down there.
Either Rudy or...

278
00:53:20,533 --> 00:53:22,808  X1:105 X2:614 Y1:450 Y2:492
...McCoy's got a half a million bucks.

279
00:53:26,933 --> 00:53:29,322  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:450 Y2:523
Just dump him down a dry well,
if you can find one.

280
00:53:29,413 --> 00:53:31,449  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:450 Y2:492
No, he ought to be buried proper.

281
00:53:32,773 --> 00:53:34,604  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:450 Y2:492

284
00:54:55,773 --> 00:54:57,411  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:450 Y2:492
Kind of tricky, isn't it?

285
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,051  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:450 Y2:518
-Thank you.
