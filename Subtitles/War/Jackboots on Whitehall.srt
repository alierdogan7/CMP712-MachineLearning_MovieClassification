G1
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,799
(Man) This is the BBC Home Service.

2
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,513
Here is the news at nine o'clock.

3
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,838
The unsuccessful evacuation
of our armed forces from Dunkirk

4
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,917
has resulted in over a quarter of a million
of our troops

5
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,554
stranded in occupied France.

6
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,830
The Ministry of Defense has announced

7
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,159
that, as of this moment, we should expect
a full German invasion of this country

8
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,191
over the forthcoming weeks.

9
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,231
(Engines droning)

10
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,235
Bandits bearing one, zero, one.

11
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,192
Stay tight. We should
have a visual any minute.

12
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,310
Listen up, Johnny,
it's just you and me now.

13
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,396
Stick close and don't do anything foolish.

14
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,829
Roger, Red Leader. I'm right behind you.

15
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,270
Right. Let's see how many of these bastards
we can take with us.

16
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,316
There they are.
Bombers, three o'clock, low.

17
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,557
For King and country. Tally ho!

18
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,680
Johnny! I said stay on my wing!

19
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,711
But I've got one in my sight.

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,991
Don't be a bloody fool!

21
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,032
There's a Kraut with the hots for you.
You're a sitting duck, man!

22
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,313
He's got me, I'm hit!

23
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,871
Johnny! Get out of there!
Use your damn parachute!

24
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,478
I can't! My canopy's stuck!

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,636
(Screams) Help!

26
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,079
(Screams)

27
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,469
You rotters! You stinking rotters!

28
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,988
All right, this is for Johnny

29
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,439
and all the others!

30
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,035
(Clanging)

31
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,438
Ha! Take that, Fritzy.

32
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,831
- (Rattling)
- Damn, I'm hit!

33
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,035
I'm going down!

34
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,832
We're done for.

35
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,395
It's all over to you now,
the people of England.

36
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,159
Tell my wife I love her very much.

37
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,351
(Engines droning)

38
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,319
(Camera clicks)

39
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,711
(Birdsong)

40
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,951
(Horse whinnies)

41
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,317
(Horse snorts)

42
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,718
Chris. Come on, lad, tea break's over.

43
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,069
- Put them big hands to use.
- Coming, Tom.

44
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,634
Back to the village
for a pie and a pint, I reckon.

45
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,433
Right. Let's get this harvest home.

46
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,710
- Hyah!
- (Neighs)

47
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,716
Come on, there, boy, come on.

48
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,833
(Horse snorts)

49
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,198
- (Lively chatter)
- (Brass band)

50
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,798
(Bicycle bell)

51
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,751
(Chatter continues)

52
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,798
Ah, another day
in God's glorious kingdom!

53
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,354
- Morning, Vicar.
- Good morning, Albert.

54
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,958
Lovely day for it.

55
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,798
Then I attacked the second bunker
and destroyed three more tanks

56
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,912
before holding off the German army
single-handed,

57
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,430
- only to find I was still stuck in France.
- (Nurse) What did you do?

58
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,119
I swam the 20-odd miles of Channel
back to Dover,

59
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,470
whereupon I was presented
with my second Victoria Cross.

60
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,308
Oh! Captain English, you're so brave!

61
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,429
Yes, I know.

62
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,072
And handsome.

63
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,588
- I suppose I am, rather.
- (Nurses sigh)

64
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,838
Now, tell me, Reverend,

65
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,269
how is that fine young daughter of yours?

66
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,117
She's well, thank you, Captain.

67
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,436
A minor hiccup at boarding school.
In need of a little direction now, I think.

68
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,789
- (Woman) Have a look at my tulips.
- Daisy...

69
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,831
come and say hello to Captain English.

70
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,871
- (Low droning)
- (Wind whistling)

71
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,629
Igor!

72
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,989
Jawohl, Herr Kapitan?

73
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,429
We are 50 miles from London.

74
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,550
Prepare to test weapons.

75
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,875
Jawohl, Herr Kapitan!

76
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,912
- (Ducks quacking)
- (Man) Ah, the harvest has come home.

77
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,190
- (Chatter)
- (Horse snorts)

78
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,709
(Horse nickers)

79
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,275
Ah, a good turnout this year.

80
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,390
And look, there's lovely Daisy.

81
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,193
As charming and as sweet
as the first rose in spring.

82
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,312
Daisy? What's she doing
back from boarding school so early?

83
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,918
(Captain English laughs and snorts)

84
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,996
Yes, it is hard, juggling one's career

85
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,079
between saving England
and modeling Brylcreem and rugby shorts.

86
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,519
Amazing!

87
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,676
- (Nurses giggle)
- (Laughs and snorts)

88
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,709
Now...

89
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,352
- Hello, Daisy.
- Chris!

90
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,709
- Ooh! Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, careful.

91
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,354
- Here, let me get those for you.
- (Crunch)

92
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,789
Oh, sorry, they're a little bit crushed.

93
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,831
Oh, don't worry, Chris, it's all right.

94
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,236
So, you're a farmer now. I thought you
always wanted to join the army.

95
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,555
No, they said my hands are too big.

96
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,956
They said hands like this is more valuable
in a cornfield than in a battlefield.

97
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,639
Oh, you and your big hands. (Chuckles)

98
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,035
Always got you into trouble,
like that time at Sunday school.

99
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,275
So, are you gonna be
around these parts for a while, then?

100
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,357
Oh, it looks that way.
Father wants me to become a FANY.

101
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,198
- You what?
- A FANY. First Aid Nursing Yeomanry.

102
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,391
We're all young FANY here.
Matron Rutty is our head FANY.

103
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,158
Girls, do your bit!

104
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,272
Join my FANY and see the world!

105
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,675
(Vicar) Daisy! Where the hell are you?

106
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,790
Oh, that's Father. I'd better be off.

107
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,195
Bye, Chris.
Oh, and it was nice seeing you again.

108
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,310
- Bye, Daisy.
- (Captain snorts, nurses laugh)

109
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,396
What were you doing talking to that boy?

110
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,557
It's only Chris, Father.
We used to be friends.

111
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,397
Don't be ridiculous, Daisy.

112
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,830
The village orphan,
with those fat, retarded hands?

113
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,792
Oh, take no notice of what they say, lad.

114
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,073
Herr Kapitan, target sighted.

115
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,554
Eine small Englander village.

116
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,831
Excellent. Stand by, all stations.

117
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,279
(Perky tune)

118
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,390
- (Man) Hang on, hang on...
- (Concerned chatter)

119
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,637
- (Villagers gasping)
- (Man) Oh, my goodness!

120
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,989
Watch out, there's a whiff of Fritz in the air.

121
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,357
Oh, my gosh.

122
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,398
Oh, dear.

123
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,472
Open ze bomb bay!

124
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,317
Achtung.

125
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,639
Achtung.

126
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,275
(Kapitan laughs)

127
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,912
Was ist das?

128
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,552
Ein perambulator?

129
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,750
Ein Englander baby?

130
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,358
Igor. Bomb. Los!

131
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,591
- (Whistling)
- (Man) Run for your lives!

132
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,392
Nazi bomb! Look out!

133
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,993
Oh, shit, it's heading for the baby's pram.

134
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,439
(Both laugh)

135
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,629
(Laughs)

136
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,675
(Baby crying)

137
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,029
- (Wind whooshes)
- (Creaking)

138
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,112
(Screams)

139
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,913
(Women screaming)

140
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,393
Bloody 'ell.

141
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,149
Shitbuckets! That's blown my chances
of marrying off Daisy.

142
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,953
Reverse engines. Schnell!

143
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,710
(Hinges creaking)

144
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,831
Come on, what are you waiting for?
He's a sitting duck!

145
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,438
Action stations!

146
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,832
Here we go, lads!

147
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,111
(Chris) Tom, get the hay off that cart
and load up the machine gun.

148
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,950
Let's go hunt some Germans.

149
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,956
Let 'em have it, girls!

150
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,317
- (Bullets pinging)
- Ha! Bullets will do nothing

151
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,237
against the armour plating!

152
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,269
Fire!

153
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,232
- (Gunfire)
- Christopher, these bullets are useless.

154
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,350
We need to get the flak gun working, lad.

155
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,389
Right, Tom.

156
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,992
(Man) Keep firing!

157
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,790
- Get this thing up and running!
- I can't, it's stuck.

158
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,952
(Grunting)

159
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,673
- Right, let her rip, Albert.
- (Albert) Here we go.

160
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,436
Don't worry, I'll get the bugger.

161
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,715
- Aargh!
- You got him, Albert.

162
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,832
- We are losing altitude!
- (Alarm hooter blaring)

163
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,758
We must gain height. Drop ze ballast.

164
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,588
It is not good, Herr Kapitan,
we are too heavy!

165
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,551
We must lose more weight!

166
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,354
We cannot let ze zeppelin
fall into enemy hands.

167
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,391
For ze fatherland, Igor.

168
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,396
Jawohl, Herr Kapitan.

169
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,668
(Laughs)

170
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,029
Heil Hitler!

171
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,913
Aaaargh!

172
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,234
A slight improvement in altitude, sir.

173
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,269
Raus!

174
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,514
Heil Hitler!

175
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,832
(Yells)

176
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,836
(Screams)

177
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,390
- (Cheering)
- (Chris) We've got him on the run!

178
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,271
(Tom) He's on the run!

179
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,311
(Laughs)

180
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,635
Bye-bye, Englanders!

181
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,511
(Voice reverberates)

182
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,556
(Man chuckles)

183
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,957
(German accent) I'm going to bring
my little barges across the water.

184
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,159
Ach! You win again, Herr Goebbels.

185
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,873
You stopped me from invading England.

186
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,717
I did, I did! (Laughs)

187
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,150
That makes it three-nil. (Laughs)

188
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,079
But still, this hasn't solved
the problem of the invasion.

189
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,678
Oh, hi, boys!

190
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,472
(Both) Himmler!

191
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,875
Goering, old bean, you're looking good.

192
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,276
Hello, Goebbels.
How are you feeling, little fellow?

193
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,595
(Goebbels) I beat Herr Goering at war!

194
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,599
So, you still can't find a way
into England, Goering?

195
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,359
Nein. I have tried everything.

196
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,472
Zis endless fog
over the Englander Channel

197
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,717
has prevented all of our plans
for invading England.

198
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,435
Well, now that the whole
of ze Englander army is stuck in France

199
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,040
and ze RAF is annihilated!

200
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,274
Ah-da, da-da, da-da!

201
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,550
Ze Fuhrer has an ingenious plan of attack.

202
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,591
Oh, what is it, Herr Himmler?

203
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,349
I have tried every possible means
of attacking zat little island.

204
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,914
He wants us to dig
under ze Englander Channel

205
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,235
right into ze heart of London,

206
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,352
capture Herr Winston Churchill
from Downing Street,

207
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,960
zen lock him in a cage!

208
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,718
(Himmler and Goebbels laugh)

209
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,117
Ooh, what a beautiful plan, mein Fuhrer.

210
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,628
Did you hear that, Goebbels, darling?

211
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,309
- We will be summering in London!
- Oh, joyous joy!

212
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,514
Oh-ho! Not even the Englander weather
can prevent us now!

213
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,551
(All laugh)

214
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,231
(Waves crashing, seagulls crying)

215
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,357
(Engine roars)

216
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,632
(Engine spluttering)

217
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,399
Spitfire!

218
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,759
Look, Tom.

219
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,076
Yeah, and I reckon
that's the last of the few.

220
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,111
(Seagulls crying)

221
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,757
(Aeroplane approaching)

222
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,550
(Engine spluttering)

223
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,359
Shiiiiiit!

224
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,910
(Screams)

225
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,512
(Bicycle bell rings)

226
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,354
Ah!

227
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,958
Whoo-ee!

228
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,118
(American accent) Crash and burn!
Just like my second marriage.

229
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,549
Hey, what the? What's this?

230
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,556
Smells like Russky propaganda.

231
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,556
Shit.

232
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,398
It looks like England
just screwed the pooch.

233
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,749
- (Clunk)
- I gotta haul ass to London.

234
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,872
These commies ain't seen
the last of Billy Fiske!

235
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,239
- (Engine revs)
- Yaah!

236
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,592
(Scraping)

237
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,599
(Churchill) I can't be doing with
all these politics of war and suchlike.

238
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,598
Much rather spend me time
painting landscapes,

239
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,471
or building a wall.

240
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,593
Nice cul-de-sac for our retirement,
eh, Pinkypoo?

241
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,996
- (Meow)
- Just three more days till me pension.

242
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,077
- (Boy) Morning paper, sir?
- Ah, thank you.

243
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,237
What's this? Invasion looms?

244
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,953
Hitler will invade today?

245
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,035
Blast!

246
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,355
So much for an early retirement.

247
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,198
'Ere, are you Mr Winston Churchill?

248
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,593
Hmm? What?

249
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,119
Why, yes, I am.

250
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,515
- Is that your cat? He looks like Hitler.
- (Meow)

251
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,551
What? Pinkypoo?

252
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,591
- (Hammering)
- Stuff and nonsense.

253
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,995
And what the bloody hell
is going on up there?

254
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,234
Who the devil are you?

255
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,032
Joseph Kaplinsky,

256
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,310
Polish Electrical Services.

257
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,238
I make better telegraph lines for you.

258
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,149
You can't just go putting up new telegraph
lines wherever you damn well please!

259
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,760
This is a listed road, man.

260
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,076
Bah, I don't know why Hitler
bothered with you Polish lot.

261
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,911
- (Ticking)
- (Seagulls crying)

262
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,035
(Grunting)

263
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,674
- (Thud)
- Les Anglais... (Spits)

264
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,829
- There's a foreigner down on the beach.
- How can you tell, Albert?

265
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,077
He's funny-looking,
and he's up to something.

266
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,633
Oh, let's have a look.

267
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,472
It's just a fisherman, Albert.

268
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,193
You can never be too careful these days.

269
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,470
Albert, if the Nazis invade,

270
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,318
do you really think they'll do it
in a little boat like that?

271
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,318
Well, I'm going to keep an eye on him.

272
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,239
- (Woman) Just as the sun was rising
- Huh?

273
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,511
I heard a maiden sing

274
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,189
- In the valley below
- Huh.

275
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,117
Oh, don't des...

276
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,197
Ooh, good morrow, kind sir. (Giggles)

277
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,992
Alors.

278
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,309
(Himmler) Ja, that's it! Keep drilling!

279
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,352
London can't be far now!

280
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,391
(Gentle music playing)

281
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,675
(Pouring)

282
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,275
How's that foreigner getting on
down there, Albert?

283
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,117
(Grunting and moaning)

284
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,118
He's getting on all right,
by the looks of things.

285
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,230
Another cup of tea, Christopher?

286
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,555
- No, thanks.
- You all right, my lad?

287
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,951
'Ere, I know what's wrong.
He's all loved up with that vicar's daughter.

288
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,877
Ah, leave it out.

289
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,388
Can't join the army, can't join the navy,

290
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,032
can't even get in the blinkin' Home Guard.

291
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,038
Sorry, Chris, but you know
the army's rules about hands.

292
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,640
Yeah, fingers too big
to fit in the trigger guard.

293
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,636
Now that's just nonsense.

294
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,319
They're a fine set of paws
you got there, lad,

295
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,635
don't let anybody tell you no different.

296
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,150
How the hell can I fight a Nazi invasion
with a pitchfork and a tractor?

297
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,998
Invasion?
Nah, there won't be no invasion, lad.

298
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,349
Yeah, they won't get past us.

299
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,834
There's absolutely nothing
we ain't thought of.

300
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,349
- (Big Ben bongs)
- English Chronicle! English Chronicle!

301
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,437
Invasion looms! Read all about it!

302
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,789
- English Chronicle!
- (Man) Oh, God, another day at the office.

303
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,912
- Drives me up the bleedin' wall.
- (Bus bell dings)

304
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,838
(Man) Veg! Get your lovely veg!

305
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,393
'Ere y'are, darlin', you need your greens.

306
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,989
(2nd man) Dutch tulips!
Get 'em while they're good!

307
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,031
(1st man) Get your veg! Come on!

308
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,435
- (Rumbling)
- (Traders continue calling)

309
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,313
Oh, I say, what is that noise?

310
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,191
(Pigeon fluttering)

311
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,595
- What's that?
- (Horn beeps)

312
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,517
(Rattling)

313
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,675
What the?

314
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,479
What's this? Some kind of earthquake?

315
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,551
(Rumbling continues)

316
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,955
I say, Pomfrey, do you hear what I hear?

317
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,558
What the dickens?

318
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,669
(Bang)

319
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,036
(People screaming)

320

(Engine rumbling)

321
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,348

(Man barking instructions in German)

323
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,268
Holy shit.

324
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,072
(Man) Jesus Christ!

325
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,594
Fuckin' Ada!

326
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,515
(German shouting)

327
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,233
- (Women screaming)
- Look! Nelson's Column.

328
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,352
Herr Himmler, success.
We are in London.

329
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,075
Ahhh, excellent!

330
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,350
Right through ze Northern Line.

331
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,995
They'll be having delays on zat

332
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,395
(Himmler laughs exuberantly)

333

(Man screaming)

334
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,111

336
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,668
Feuer!

337

(Grunting)

338
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,556
- (Woman screams)
- (Over speakers) Do not run.

339
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,431
Ze German army is your friend.

340

Hey, don't worry, kid. I'm an American.

(Snoring)

349
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,396
Buggers are here! Tunnelled right up
into our back entrance.

350
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,113
What? Retirement shall have to wait.

351
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,037
It is time for action.

352
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,631
Sir, no, your place is here. We can't risk
losing you. You must stay in the bunker.

353
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,514
We have no army left. Who else
is going to defend Downing Street?

354
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,235
We still have Major Rupee
and his brave Punjabi guards.

355
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,352
I guarantee they will stand and fight.

356
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,594
(Major Rupee) Brave men of the Punjab,

357
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,837
we are the last of the remaining Empire,

358
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,678
the only soldiers England has left.

359
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,677
Their army has surrendered, helpless,
on the shores of Dunkirk.

360
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,034
So now this honour
has been bestowed on us -

361
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,469
us, the men of the Raj.

362
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,674
And when the time comes
we will all do our duty for England

363
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,792
and protect Churchill Sahib
at all costs!

364
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,592
- (Fiske) Whoo-ee!
- (Tyres squeal)

365
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,437
What in the name of?

366
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,392
Bloody 'ell, it's Billy Fiske!

367
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,716
Well, if it ain't Major Rupee
and his pack of Injuns.

368
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,117
You mean to tell me that out of
the whole bloody Royal Air Force

369
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,391
the only pilot to survive
the Battle of Britain was...

370
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,512
An American! That's right, hot dog.

371
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,959
Mornin', boys.

372
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,436
I suppose you have come to pay me
that 50 American dollars you owe me?

373
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,756
Nope. Wallet got shot
out of my pants this morning.

374
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,758
Your 50 bucks is somewhere
over France now, buddy.

375
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,313
I might have known!

376
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,638
That is the last time I play poker with
some half-wit, two-bit crop-duster pilot.

377
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,878
Oh, yeah? Pal, half the Soviet army
is around that corner.

378
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,909
You mean German.

379
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,997
They're gonna roll their tanks up this street
like shit through a goose,

380
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,554
so quit your jabbering and saddle up.

381
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,319
- (Fiske) Lock and load, guys!
- Make ready, men!

382
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,635
Hey, pal, time to take a hike.

383
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,399
No, no! I nearly finished!

384
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,032
Crazy-ass Polack.

385
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,799
OK, Rupe, let's light the candles.

386
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,356
Corporal, light the invasion beacon!
They are on their way.

387
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,311
Yes, Major. Light the beacon!

388
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,276
It's the beacon at Whitehall!

389
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,992
Light the beacon!

390
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,072
What's that?

391
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,269
Blimey.

392
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,835
It's the beacon at Crystal Palace!

393
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,030
Fire the beacon, lads! It's the invasion!

394
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,274
The beacon at Croydon's been lit, sir!

395
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,511
(Flames whoosh)

396
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,109
Father, look! It's the invasion beacon
at Maidstone.

397
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,513
They've come.

398
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,710
It's the invasion. Look!

399
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,671
Light the beacon, Albert.

400
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,790
Back to the village, lads.
There ain't much time.

401
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,239
(Flames whoosh)

402
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,352
Sacre bleu!

403
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,998
Take up your positions, men!

404
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,359
Come on, you guys, get that MG movin'.

405
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,436
We've got ourselves a war to win!

406
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,313
All right, commie assholes,

407
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,920
it's time to hammer down the sickle.

408
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,234
(Tom) Got it, I've got it.

409
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,748
- (Chatter, shushing)
- (Chris) Quiet, quiet, it's the news.

410
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,917
This is the BBC Home Service.

411
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,713
Here is the news at 12 o'clock.

412
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,957
- The German army has invaded London.
- (All gasp)

413
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,515
I repeat. The German army
has invaded London.

414
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,516
London! I don't believe it.

415
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,154
Why can't they stay in their own country?

416
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,794
The Prime Minister will now make a speech

417
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,559
from the Cabinet War Rooms
in Downing Street.

418
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,670
(Churchill) My dear countrymen,

419
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,631
my dear friends.

420
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,593
Never in the field of human conflict

421
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,517
was so much

422
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,836
buggered up by so few for so many.

423
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,236
- (Radio crackling and whistling)
- This isl...

424
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,157
What's wrong with it?

425
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,873
(Himmler) Germany calling,
Germany calling.

426
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,558
Hello, Englanders!

427
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,273
Zis is ze voice of ze Nazis!

428
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,835
Ze whole of ze BBC are now dead.

429
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,395
We have successfully invaded
your capital city of London,

430
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,908
und are ready to capture
your beloved prime minister,

431
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,350
Herr Winston Churchill,
from Downing Strasse - oh, ja -

432
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,949
who we have a very special message for.

433
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,992
Do not hide. We will find you.

434
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,759
You are as good as captured...

435
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,869
fat boy.

436
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,071
No one can escape ze Third Reich!

437
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,633
(Laughs)

438
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,715
(Crackling, whistling)

439
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,672
(Churchill)... that is all I have to say
on the matter.

440
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,234
Apart from my elite Punjabi guards,

441
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,955
we have absolutely no military defence
whatsoever.

442
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,989
(Villagers muttering)

443
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,398
Therefore I ask any of you
who are in any way able to come to our aid,

444
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,079
- to do so immediately.
- (Man) We're buggered.

445
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,317
When I give the order,
we should retreat to...

446
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,112
Where should we retreat to, Monty?

447
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,752
How the hell should I know?

448
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,711
Retreat to, er...

449
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,751
- Retreat to...
- (Bagpipes playing)

450
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,914
...Scot Land.

451
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,552
The Land of the Scots?!

452
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,072
But, sir, the... the Scots are hordes
of murderous blood-drinking savages.

453
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,556
Retreat to Scot Land.

454
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,830
Head north to Hadrian's Wall.

455
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,314
Good luck, and God save us all.

456
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,948
- (Villagers muttering)
- (Man) Should we go to Scot Land?

457
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,991
(Daisy) Scot Land?

458
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,189
(Tom) Hadrian's Wall?

459
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,390
Surrender seems to be our only option.

460
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,477
You hear that?
They're talking about surrender.

461
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,229
I've never been to London. Where is it?
Let's go back to the pub.

462
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,953
- Father, they're leaving.
- Stay and fight!

463
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,230
- Be more like the foreigner.
- (Man) Like who?

464
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,918
The foreigner. Him.

465
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,951
(Girls giggling)

466
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,520
- (Man) That's my wife!
- (Foreigner grunts)

467
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,790
- (Tom) Who's he?
- Found him down on the beach.

468
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,515
(Grunts) La guerre?
Je vive pour la guerre! (Laughs)

469
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,155
- Resistance fighter, no doubt.
- Tu deconnes ou quoi?

470
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,997
Je m'appelle Gaston Le Roq!

471
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,878
Je suis francais!

472
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,036
Ah, sod this, I'm off home.

473
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,469
You'll have no homes left to go back to.

474
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,671
- (Chris) What's wrong with you all?
- Chris?

475
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,712
Have you forgotten
what being English means?

476
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,751
It means being free.

477
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,634
I might just be a simple farm boy,
but at least I'm a free simple farm boy.

478
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,830
What does freedom mean to you?

479
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,668
Freedom to grow your own crops
and graze livestock.

480
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,109
Think what they'll do to your farms.

481
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,991
Your cows, Farmer Grey.

482
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,110
Your pigs, Mr and Mrs Sparrow.

483
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,479
I've got a ferret.

484
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,193
Think what will happy to your FANY,
Matron Rutty.

485
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,992
Join me...

486
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,191
so that in future years
you can proudly say,

487
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,832
"I fought for England!"

488
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,598
Now who is with me?

489
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,915
(Villagers cheering)

490
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,236
- Are you ready for a war?
- (Cheering stops)

491
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,919
(Stuttering) We got no guns.

492
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,918
He's right, Christopher. We used up
all our weapons against that zeppelin.

493
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,598
Huh? Pas de probleme.

494
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,558
- (Bottles clink)
- Merde.

495
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,919
Voila.

496
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,997
(Grunts) All right, you fuckers,

497
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,076
arm yourselves!

498
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,430
Wow, Chris, when did you get so tough?

499
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,879
Phew, I like it.

500
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,990
The army won't be able
to hold out for long.

501
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,555
We need to get to London.
It's not far, we can make it if we move now.

502
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,309
Don't be bloody ridiculous, boy.
How do you propose we get there?

503
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,032
On old Betty.

504
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,872
- (Villagers oohing)
- Bastard!

505
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,476
TNT, up the line!

506
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,999
I am coming, Sahib!

507
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,358
Pack as much TNT
into the barricades as you can.

508
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:54,030
These firecrackers will bust their German
bottoms right back to Berlin! (Laughs)

509
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,151
Achtung! Achtung!

510
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,476
All units, proceed towards Downing Street

511
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,195
und take out ze number ten house.

512
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,835
(Speaking German)... Downing Strasse.

513
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,951
(Barking instructions in German)

514
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,713
(Hissing, creaking)

515
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,514
All of you FANYs go with Tom,
make your way to Hadrian's Wall.

516
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,755
We're heading for London!

517
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,793
Just keep your big hands
off my daughter, boy.

518
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,311
(Rumbling)

519
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,990
It's time to take out the Russky trash.

520
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,076
You mean Nazi trash!

521
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,792
(Rattling)

522
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,870
I am frightened, Sahib.

523
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,592
Stay close to me.

524
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,268
- A lot of people are going to die today.
- (Whooshing)

525
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,272
(Man screams)

526
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,112

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,553
MG-42, right flank.

532
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,477
Get some!

533
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,910
Fall back! Fall back

534
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,110

535

537
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,793
Oops.

538
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,759
Gott im Himmel! We must take out

539
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,758
That is where ze dog Churchill is hiding.

540
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,279
Take it out!

541
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,595
(Over speakers)
Jawohl, Herr Obergruppenfuhrer.

542
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,398
Oi! Wrong bleedin' 'ouse!

551
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,550
(Chuffing)

552
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,716
We're approaching London.

553
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,352
Full steam ahead!

554
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,072
(Whistle toots)

555
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,680
Oh, I say.

556
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,471
(Shouting in German)

557
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,559
Fall back, men.
I'm going to blow the barricades.

558
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,036
- (Man screaming)
- (Fiske yelling)

559
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,470
I cannot lift you, sir. You're just too heavy.

560
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,433
Buddy, we got about ten seconds
before these barricades pop.

561
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,790
But Sergeant Erummel is
the heaviest soldier in the Punjab.

562
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,558
No man can lift him.

563
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,989
I grew up liftin' redwoods in South Dakota.

564
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,555
No little Injun's gonna weigh
Billy Fiske down. I got ya, buddy.

565
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,637
Never leave a man behind!

566
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,432
Fiske! Get out of there!

567
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,714
- (Screams)
- (Crunch)

568
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,598
Don't leave me!

569
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,398
Home run!

570
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,715
Whoa, that was intense, Billy Fiske.

571
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,228
Hell, that's what all the gals say.

572
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,633
Everybody, take cover.

573
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,513
- Fire in the hole!
- (Rupee) Fire in the hole!

574
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,998
(Fiske) Yee-ha!

575
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,352
(Planks clattering)

576
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,394
What the hell are those blasted
Punjabis doing up there?

577
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,908
Nearly brought down
the whole bloody house.

578
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,635
You, uh... You think you used
enough dynamite there, buddy?

579
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,509
(Hissing)

580
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,832
(Himmler shouting in German
over speakers)

581
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,519
It has not stopped them!

582
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,120
Unless we get through that wall,
Mr Churchill is finished.

583
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,549
- (Rumbling)
- Hey, what's that sound?

584
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,192
Oh, they're attacking
from both bloody ends!

585
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,749
Holy balls on a buffalo!

586
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,872
(Grunts) We're here to rescue Mr Churchill.

587
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,831
Well, just in the nick of bloody time too.

588
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,791
Get into the house! Go, go, go!

589
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,159
I hear ya, Rupee.

590
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,875
Door breach!

591
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,636
Let's go rescue the President.

592
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,434
- Now what? Who the devil are you, sirs?
- Prime Minister!

593
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,075
- We've come to rescue you, sir.
- Billy Fiske, American Volunteers.

594
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,829
They brought some crazy-ass war machine
to bust you outta here.

595
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,509
Aha! Finally a chance to face Fritz.

596
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,834
Sir, you'll need a gun.

597
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,269
- No problem. Monty?
- Yes, sir!

598
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,157
Aha! A little cubbyhole.

599
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,351
Mum's the word, eh, lads?
Wife doesn't know.

600
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,189
Shall we, gentlemen?

601
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,151
- Follow me!
- (Fiske) Move, move!

602
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,071
We need to get past those tanks.

603
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,714
If we stay here, we're trapped
like rats in a barrel.

604
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,112
(Gaston) Oh-ho!

605
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,517
Eat hot lead, Fritz!

606
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,272
Look what you've done to me wall,
you young hooligan!

607
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,515
(Chris) Sorry, sir! Daisy, let's go, come on.

608
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,393
(Monty) That's your ticket out of here.
Get on, Winston!

609
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,193
Mr President, you gotta
get your ass outta here.

610
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,229
Allez!

611
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,953
There's not enough power!
We need to get more steam into her.

612
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,594
Do something, boy!

613
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,189
Coal! We need to build up the pressure
until she hits 150,

614
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,151
then yank down on the handbrake!

615
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,998
Don't let her hit 160 or she'll blow!

616
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,678
(Daisy) Right, Chris.

617
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,359
Get zis turret working!

618
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,799

619
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,158
(Chris) Pressure... thirty.

620
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,236
(Daisy) More coal! Come on, come on!

621
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,918
Faster, faster!

622
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,359
(Kaplinsky yelling)

623
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,239

624
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,632
(Kaplinsky) Hey! Stop! Stop!

625
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,796
He's stuck. The bastard's stuck.

626
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,239

627
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,113
No, no, I not finish yet!

628
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,310
(Chris) Come on, come on!

629
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,875
(Himmler) Schnell, schnell!
He's getting away!

630
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,955
Eins, zwei...

631
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,479

632
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,357

639
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,590

640
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,437

642
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,791
(Laughs maniacally)

643
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,955
(Himmler) London is ours!

644
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,872
(Bus bell dings)

645
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,911
(Military march)

646
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,111
(Jackboots thudding)

647
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,790
I wanna go 'ome.

00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,758
(2nd man laughs)

651
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,791
(Goering shrieking with laughter)

652
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,272
So where shall we go now, Herr Goering?

653
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,756
- Our new home!
- (Goebbels) Yoo-hoo!

654
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,156

655
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,952
(Soldiers chanting in German)

656
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,870
- (Aeroplanes passing)
- (Chanting continues)

657
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:15,115
Ahem. Er, excuse me,
but this happens to be my house.

658
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,752
(Laughs)

659
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,711

- Don't you realise?
- (Water dripping)

662
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,433
I'm three-quarters German!

00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,671
(Rattling, chuffing)

664
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,432
(Brakes hiss)

665
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,833
(Daisy gasps)

666
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,599
They're burning London.

667
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,950
Our great city has suffered much this day.

668
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,039
(Vicar) Only Nazi scum would stoop so low!

669
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,157
(Church bells ringing,
fire bells clanging, gunfire)

670
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,157
(Chuffing)

671
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,959
- Chris.
- Oh. Morning, Daisy.

672
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,150
Chris, you've been driving all night.

673
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,159
- Why didn't you sleep?
- I didn't want to waste time.

674
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,191
Aren't you cold? I've got a blanket if you...

675
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,708
No, I'm all right. The fire's still blazing.

676
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,112
It's so calm and peaceful. You wouldn't
think there was a war going on.

677
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,835
Yeah, it's, er...
it's pretty beautiful, isn't it?

678
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,950
You've done so much, Chris,

679
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,594
- so much for England.
- (Wood pigeon cooing)

680
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:22,111
Ah, what a wonderful morning
the Good Lord has brought us,

681
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,232
- eh, bastard?
- (Whistle toots)

682
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,558
Ah, time for breakfast and a nice cigar.

683
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,878
I wonder how Major Rupee
and the Punjabis got out of London.

684
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,191
Yo, Indians! I got me some new wings!

685
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,549
Race ya to Hadrian's Wall!

686
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,989
Whoo-hoo!

687
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,231

(Bagpipes playing)

690
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,838
(Chris) What is this place?

691
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,997
(Churchill) The remains of the Lost Legion.

692
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,996
In the final years of his rule,

693
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,636
Roman emperor Hadrian sent troops
to the outer borders of England.

694
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,795
They never returned.

695
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,638
This is their tomb.

696
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,871
(Betty creaking)

697
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,037
(Brakes hiss)

698
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,998
Hadrian's Wall. Look, Daisy!

699
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,389
It's a bloody miracle.

700
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,433
(Tom) Open the gates, lad!
Open the gates!

701
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,515
(Man) Open the gates!

702
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,915
(Tom) It's Chris,
and Prime Minister Churchill!

703
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,349
(Man) They made it!
(2nd man) Bring 'em in, lads.

704
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,871
Whoo-ee! Now that's what I call
American spirit.

705
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,115
We have arrived.

706
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,436
'Tis a great feat of English endurance.

707
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,040
But endurance breeds appetite.

708
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,072
So tonight we feast!

709
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:41,749
- (Lively fiddle playing)
- (Chatter, men laughing)

710
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,870
(Men cheering)

711
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,117
There certainly is an abundance
of young females, eh?

712
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,878
(Giggling)

713
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,559
Hey, Rupes, she's lookin' at ya.

714
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,750
Oh, she looks dirty.

715
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,030
(Albert) Back in '79...

716
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:01,995
and there I was,
out of ammunition and surrounded.

717
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,110
Fuzzies everywhere.

718
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,071
Oh, such bravery!

719
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,749
Look, everyone's here.
It's a miracle we all made it.

720
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,392
That's right, Christopher.

721
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,272
(Churchill) Dear, oh dear, oh dear,
oh dear, oh dear.

722
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,038
(Chris) Mr Churchill?

723
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,628
A lost soul on the eve of battle.

724
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,796
Go and see if he's all right, lad.

725
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,835
(Lantern creaking)

726
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,996
(Owl hoots)

727
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,395
Hello? Mr Churchill?

728
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,599
Hello?

729
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,031
(Owl hoots)

730
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,951
(Wind whistling)

731
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,391
(Low whooshing)

732
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,829
(Water flowing, birdsong)

733
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,958
Albert. Albert, look down there.

734
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,638
A basket.

735
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,797
- What is it, Tom?
- Albert, it's a baby.

736
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,353
(Crying)

737
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,472
There, there, young 'un, it's all right,
don't cry. Uncle Tom's here.

738
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,478
What is this thing?

739
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,195
It's only a baby, Vicar,
we found him in the reeds there.

740
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,119
Ah, that is no mortal child.
Look at the bastard's hands.

741
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,673
The sign of Lucifer.

742
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,473
Tie a stone round its neck,
and cast it back into the river.

743
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,999
Rid us of its evil!

744
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,758
I think I'll call him Christopher.

745
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,553
Do as you wish,
but be it on your eternal souls.

746
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,717
I shall not baptise that creature.
He is one of them!

747
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,992
- Them?
- Them. Them from the North.

748
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,951
(Low whooshing)

749
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,112
(Owl hoots)

750
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,229
- (Wind whistling)
- (Knocking sounds)

751
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,112
(Footsteps)

752
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,358
Ah, Mr Churchill.

753
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,517
Old uniforms, sir.
Must be left over from years ago.

754
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,199
Aha, the old 42nd.

755
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,879
They were posted up here under
the command of the Duke of Wellington.

756
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,559
See to it that they are
distributed amongst the men.

757
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,272
Yes, sir.

758
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,869
- 'Ere, squire, look at my jacket.
- (Laughs) That won't fit you.

759
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,388
Nice, innit? Nice bit of fabric, that, yeah.

760
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,034
Hey, nice uniforms, guys!

761
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,913
(Crow cawing, distant party sounds)

762
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,911
(Churchill) Christopher,
I must thank you for saving my life.

763
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,996
You would make a fine soldier.

764
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,510
Well, the government don't think so.
They reckon my hands are too big.

765
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,028
And... (Chuckles)... well...

766
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,593
they are pretty big.

767
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,155
The government? I am the government.

768
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,556
And so, from this day on,
you are a soldier

769
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,158
in His Majesty's forces.

770
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,670
Oh, thank you, sir, thank you so much.
I won't let you down, I promise.

771
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,994
I'm counting on it.

772
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,634
The battle for London is over.

773
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,990
The battle for England is about to begin.

774
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,029
(Daisy) Mr Churchill!

775
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,356
Mr Churchill, Chris! Look at the sky!

776
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,193
- Aha, aurora borealis. The northern lights.
- (People gasping)

777
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,909
Lts name comes from
the Roman goddess of dawn.

778
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,996
Ancient Norse mythology suggests

779
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,350
that the light came from the Valkyries
riding through the sky,

780
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,278
collecting the dead from the battlefields,

781
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,915
but it's little more than
an atmospheric phenomenon,

782
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,872
though rather spectacular, I must say.

783
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,598
(Daisy) Isn't it beautiful, Chris?

784
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,757
Yes, it is.

785
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,388
But... (Chuckles)... tonight is not the night
for you two to be listening

786
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,431
to the ramblings of an old man.

787
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,431
Shall we go somewhere else?

788
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,917
(Owl hoots)

789
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,593
You know, I've always loved you, Daisy.

790
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,672
- (Unzips)
- (Daisy) Oh, my gosh.

791
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,711
(Daisy moaning softly)

792
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,149
(Lively piano rendition of Silent Night)

793
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,631
(Piano continues)

794
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,718
(Goering) Ho, ho, ho! (Laughs)

795
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,519
We brought Christmas early!

796
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,597
- (Goering and Goebbels laugh)
- (O Tannenbaum on piano)

797
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,791
London is ours! Jawohl!

798
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,717
(All laughing)

799
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,677
Ooh, ooh! Ohhh!

800
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,835
(Goebbels screams)

801
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,350
- (Laughter)
- Goebbels, my Liebling!

802
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,709
(Himmler laughs)

803
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,955
- (Piano stops abruptly)
- Da-daaa!

804
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,719
Well, hello, boys. It's me!

805
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,113
(All) Heil Hitler!

806
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,709
What do you think? Lovely fabric, isn't it?
Feel it, feel it.

807
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,194
You look fabulous, mein Fuhrer.

808
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,913
I'm so sorry. If we'd only known
of your arrival.

809
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,032
Oh, you didn't think
I would miss zis, did you?

810
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,959
A fancy-dress party
in the Palace of Buckingham?

811
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,437
Now tell me, Mr Himmy-Himmy-Himmler,
what have you all been up to?

812
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,358
Ooh, well, mein Fuhrer,
since you have been in Paris,

813
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,039
a most excellent accomplishment
has been achieved.

814
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,719
Up until recently, mein Fuhrer,

815
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,958
ze Englander underground
was a complete and utter shambles.

816
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,151
More like a spaghetti than
a functional railway, mein Fuhrer.

817
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,317
Zis better be going somewhere.
I got an early flight from Versailles for zis.

818
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,430
(Shrieks, mumbles)

819
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,596
You're going to love zis.

820
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,348
Da-daaa!

821
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,394
We have brought efficiency
to ze London Unterground!

822
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,557
All lines lead to der Vaterland.

823
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,229
I may have ze body
of a weak und feeble Nazi,

824
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,555
but I do have a really big...

825
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,431
Luger!

826
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,677
(Bullet ricocheting)

827
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,279
We did not conquer zis backward country
in order to bring it culture and discipline.

828
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,629
We came to capture
Herr Winston Churchill.

829
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,558
So why is that cage empty?

830
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:56,149
You let Churchill get away?
Of all ze incompetent, idiotic...

831
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,758
Mobilise ze army north.

832
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,109
Send zem into damn
Scot Land if you have to.

833
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,277
- (Bagpipe music)
- Ah, yes, of course.

834
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,309
Of course.

835
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:08,239
Zat must be where zey are hiding -
the Land of the Scots!

836
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,872
Zey know we would never try to attack

837
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,435
in fear of what lies beyond
zat great Hadrian's Wall.

838
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,914
- (Hitler laughs)
- Scot Land, m-m-mein Fuhrer?

839
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,030
B-b-but ze stories!

840
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,277
Not even ze Romans went beyond
ze great Hadrian's Wall.

841
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,550
Who knows what evil lies up there?

842
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,750
Enough! You will attack Scot Land

843
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,598
und capture Herr Winston Churchill...

844
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,834
immediately!

845
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,271
(Guard) I love you, Hans.

846
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,511
- (Hitler cackling)
- (Thunder)

847
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,274
(Birdsong)

848
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,077
(Cockerel crowing)

849
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,111
(Men groaning)

850
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,151
(Man retching)

851
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,991
(Retches, vomit splatters)

852
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,035
(Snoring)

853
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,152
(Farting)

854
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,193
- (Parping)
- Sacre bleu!

855
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,879
Stone the bleedin' crows!

856
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,230
Awake, man-slobs. We have a war to win.

857
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,271
Huh? (Groans)

858
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,471
(Laughs) Well, I drank four pints of sherry.

859
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,638
- Heh! It was a damn fine evening.
- (Man) Wakey-wakey, boys, rise and shine.

860
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,636
(Rupee) Stand to, men.

861
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,591
Eyes front!

862
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,437
Straighten up that line.

863
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,436
Good morning, Rupee.

864
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,072
Ah, Churchill Sahib.

865
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,156
Your men look magnificent.

866
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,716
Thank you, sir. All men present, correct,
and uniforms fitting perfectly.

867
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,230
- (Tom) Morning, Prime Minister!
- And a good morning to you, too.

868
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,748
And a fine Highland morning it is too, sir.

869
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,156
Now, Rupee, how are things shaping up?

870
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,873
Ah, well, sir, every farmer
in England is here.

871
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,753
I bring my lads from Whitby,
North Yorkshire.

872
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,951
The men from Broad Oak, Herefordshire,
are ready, Prime Minister.

873
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,436
The Thornthwaite Cumberland boys.
Hooray!

874
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,391
Splendid, splendid.

875
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,034
It's not much, but they have a great heart.

876
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,038
The finest of our English agriculture.

877
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,877
The salt of our earth.

878
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:24,040
Just as Cromwell looked upon his
New Model Army at the field of Naseby

879
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,594
in 1645, eh, Rupee?

880
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,631
Er... yes, sir.

881
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,399
We also have an air force.
Billy Fiske has rustled up a biplane

882
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,556
and is giving basic flying lessons now.

883
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,593
All right, hot dog, listen up,
cos I'm only gonna tell you this once more.

884
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,756
You press that to start the engine,

885
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,075
you press that to fire your guns.

886
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:45,590
Engines... guns... right.

887
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:49,394
(Fiske) OK. Now take her up
and show me what you got.

888
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,431
Yeah, right. OK.

889
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,995
Third time lucky. Here we go.

890
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,838
And where the blazes
do you think you have been?

891
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,872
- Father, I can explain.
- No need to explain, young lady!

892
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,672
I understand perfectly.

893
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,995
If you think that being in Scot Land

894
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,838
is a licence to get your fat hands
on my daughter,

895
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,996
you've got another thing coming, boy!

896
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,190
- (Machine-gun fire)
- (Fiske) Oh, nuts!

897
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,075
He's doing it again!

898
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,150
Make it stop!

899
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,269
Hey!

900
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,753
- (Bell clangs)
- Hey!

901
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,918
Take your finger off the fuckin' fire button!

902
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,118
Er...

903
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,594
Well, looks like he might need
a couple more lessons, sir.

904
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,517
Shit.

905
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,396
You stupid bastard!

906
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,398
(Fiske)
Looks like I'm your air cover, Mr President.

907
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,273
Ain't no way I can teach
these douche bags how to fly.

908
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,515
- Dear, oh dear, oh dear.
- (Tom) Mr Churchill!

909
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,120
- (Thunder)
- The scouts have just returned, sir.

910
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:51,551
Reports are of Nazis, thousands of 'em,
coming from the South.

911
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,160
So, it begins.

912
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,028
We found this in the cave, sir.

913
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,389
And we managed to salvage these...

914
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,750
old flintlock muskets.
Exactly one gun per man.

915
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,679
Splendid. Let us prepare for battle.

916
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,951
Ready, aim, fire.

917
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:29,909
(Grunting and mumbling instructions)

918
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,312
(Roars)

919
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,152
Yaaah!

920
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,872
(All laughing)

921
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,198
(Himmler) Excellent.

922
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,434
(Rupee) Straighten up that line!

923
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,277
Yo, Rupee-doopee.

924
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,198
Never thought I'd see Red Injuns
this far from home.

925
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,391
And you tell me, Fiskie-whisky...

926
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,396
why did you travel 5,000 miles

927
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,557
to fight a war that the English ought
to be fighting for themselves, hmm?

928
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,797
Hey, look who's talking, pal.

929
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,398
Hmm, good point.

930
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,750
(Churchill) This is our last line of defence.

931
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:15,679
We will hold them from this wall
for as long as possible.

932
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,871
Gaston, Tom, Albert - artillery.

933
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,148
- Yes, sir.
- Oui, Monsieur Churchill.

934
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,599
- Rutty?
- Prime Minister.

935
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,279
You and Daisy are in command
of your FANY.

936
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,117
- Splendid.
- Rupee?

937
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,674
- Yes, sir!
- You remain in command of your men.

938
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,119
- Thank you, sir!
- Fiske.

939
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,958
- You're our air force.
- You got it, Mr President.

940
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,036
Now, Christopher.

941
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,878
Two days ago I was an old man,
ready for retirement.

942
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,831
I'd given up on the world,

943
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,031
but you rescued me from the boredom
and restraint of politics

944
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,594
and gave me the chance
for one more fight.

945
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:52,229
Now I'm asking you to help us again.

946
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,113
Head north into uncharted territory,

947
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,832
find whatever is out there,

948
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,759
and bring them back here
to aid us in our struggle for victory.

949
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,713
I am asking you this as a soldier.

950
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,558
As a soldier, I accept, Mr Churchill.

951
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,589
Good man.

952
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,315
I cannot underestimate
the importance of your success.

953
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,113
The future of our civilisation,

954
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,275
and my pension,

955
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,197
now rests with you.

956
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,391
- You must not fail.
- Yes, sir!

957
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,271
(Churchill) Now then...

958
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:29,475
Mr Hitler knows that they will have to
break us on this wall or lose the war.

959
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,354
Let us, therefore,
brace ourselves to our duties,

960
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,392
and do as our friend
from the United States would

961
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,749
and kick some butt!

962
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,030
(Cheering, firing guns)

963
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,189
(Fiske) Fuckin' A, Mr President.
(Daisy) Bravo!

964
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,750
Yeah! Ho-ho! Ha-ha! Ho-ho!

965
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,470
(Chris) This may be the last time
we ever see each other.

966
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,953
(Daisy) Don't say that.

967
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,833
Mr Churchill wouldn't have picked you
unless he believed in you.

968
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,996
England believes in you, Chris,

969
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,112
and... I believe in you.

970
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,632
You take care of yourself.

971
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,671
Take this shotgun.

972
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,711
It might be dangerous out there.

973
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,279
(Steam hissing)

974
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,431
I'll see you when I get back.

975
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,551
(Chuffing, squeaking)

976
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,031
I love you, Chris.

977
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,872
I love you.

978
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,311
(Jackboots thudding)

979
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,232
(Captain) Raus! Schnell!

980
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,272
(Crow cawing)

981
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,995
(Distant, steady thudding)

982
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,671
(Thudding loudens)

983
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,950
That's funny. Sounds like...

984
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,831
like a train.

985
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,269
(Thudding continues)

986
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,031
(Thudding intensifies)

987
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,039
Bloody 'ell.

988
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,431
(Man shouts in German)

989
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,753
Shit. Communists.

990
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,756
For the last time, Billy Fiske,

991
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,030
these are not communists.

992
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,992
Yeah? That's what they want you to think.

993
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:18,316
- Er...
- (Belches)

994
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,839
- Bollocks.
- (Farts)

995
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,151
(Low droning)

996
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:42,792
Uh-oh. The thin red line of heroes.

997
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,718
Ooh, I'm so frightened!

998
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,196
Hey, Rupee -
here's that 50 bucks I owe ya.

999
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,549
Ah, very decent of you, old friend.

1000
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,592
Just thought I'd square up with the house,
you know?

1001
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,557
Shame you won't get a chance to spend it.

1002
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,715
I'm waiting for you,
you son of a Nazi whore!

1003
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,716
- Father!
- Come and fight me!

1004
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,513
My god against yours!

1005
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,358
Sorry, sir, he must have
found his way back to the bottle.

1006
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,358
- Good man.
- Sausage-eating...

1007
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,549
wankers!

1008
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:20,639
(Echoing) Wankers! Wankers!
Wankers! Wankers!

1009
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,069
Let us take example from the Church.

1010
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,111
Double the ale ration!

1011
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,878
Two pints per man.

1012
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,990
Sir. Double the ale ration!

1013
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,076
(Tom) Two pints per man.

1014
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,032
Come on, lads.
Drink her right down.

1015
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:45,039
(Daisy) And did those feet

1016
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,038
In ancient time

1017
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:53,632
Walk upon England's mountain green?

1018
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:59,391
(Joins in) And was the holy land of God

1019
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:04,560
On England's pleasant pastures seen?

1020
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:10,869
- That's it! Sing! Sing!
- (All) And did the countenance divine

1021
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:16,711
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?

1022
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:20,036
And was Jerusalem

1023
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,355
- Builded here
- (Jackboots thudding)

1024
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:27,838
Among those dark satanic mills?

1025
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:31,714
Yes, those dark satanic mills!

1026
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,751
(Laughs)

1027
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:43,029
Bring me my bow of burning gold!

1028
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:48,393
Bring me my arrows of desire!

1029
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,795
Bring me my spear!

1030
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,115
O clouds, unfold!

1031
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,789
- Now, Rupee!
- Present at 100 yards!

1032
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,034
Right, here we go!

1033
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:05,592
I will not cease from mental fight

1034
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:11,317
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand

1035
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:17,435
Till we have built Jerusalem

1036
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:26,070
In England's green and pleasant land

1037
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,350
Now, Rupee! Fire!

1038
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,311
Fire!

1039
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,630
(Man) Take that, Fritz!

1040
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,275
Come and get it, you little prick!

1041
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,953
(Vicar) Got one!

1042
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,831
Fire the catapult!

1043
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,313
Allez!

1044
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:53,908
- Ow!
- Oh, my foot!

1045
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,109
Ahh!

1046
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,151
(Wind whistling)

1047
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,951
(Chains rattling)

1048
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,598
(Crow caws and flutters)

1049
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,516
(Crows cawing)

1050
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,679
(Brakes hiss)

1051
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,590
(Bagpipe music)

1052
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,555
(Men grunting and muttering gruffly)

1053
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:12,999
(Screams)

1054
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:18,034
- No, wait! No! Nooooo!
- (Men muttering)

1055
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,791
Hold hard, men!

1056
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,035
Achtung! Raus!

1057
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,116
We cannot hold it!

1058
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:26,752
Pouring hot oil!

1059
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,912
Nein! Nein!

1060
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,032
- (Laughs) 'Ave some o' that.
- It's so oily und hot!

1061
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,479
(Laughs)

1062
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,919
- (Sizzling)
- (Screaming)

1063
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,791
You fuckers!

1064
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,472
Burn...

1065
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,876
in the fires of Beelzebub!

1066
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:51,356
- (Engine droning)
- What is this? Foul play?

1067
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,757
Fear not.
We shall hold off ze attack until dawn.

1068
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:59,395
- Then Heidi and Helga will lead ze attack.
- (Leather creaking)

1069
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,395
Hello, girls!

1070
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,111
(Thunder rumbling)

1071
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,190
Gates reinforced now, Prime Minister.

1072
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:28,476
We are now truly subject to Mother Nature.

1073
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,909
(Rain falling)

1074
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,871
Bloody English weather.

1075
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:35,309
- (Thunder)
- You know, Daisy,

1076
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,510
I usually do not approve of men,

1077
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:41,599
but that boy Christopher
will make a first-rate husband.

1078
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,312
I hope I see him again.

1079
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:46,749
- Please! No, wait! I mean you no harm!
- (Wild yelling and grunting)

1080
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,156
- I just want to speak to your chief!
- (Yelling and snarling)

1081
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,717
- (Roars)
- Oh, no, please! No!

1082
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,870
No! No!

1083
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,552
(Talking "Scottish")

1084
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,793
(Man talking "Scottish")
...ye cannae argue wi' the man.

1085
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,070
- (Men grunting and muttering)
- No, get off!

1086
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,031
Please! Leave me alone!

1087
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,799
- (Man laughs)
- No! No!

1088
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,115
Noooo!

1089
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,029
Who's there?

1090
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:36,073
(Australian-Scottish accent)
It is I, the chief of this clan.

1091
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:39,157
- Who are you?
- My name is Chris.

1092
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,758
Chris, is it?

1093
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:43,109
Are you an assassin, Chris?

1094
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,469
No. I'm a soldier from England.

1095
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,990
Hmm, a soldier from England, is it?

1096
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,554
And what did they tell you in England?

1097
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,875
That we are complete savages?

1098
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,549
There are some that think that,
but I have heard a different tale.

1099
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,957
The tale of a great Scottish hero,
who defended Scot Land all on his own.

1100
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,639
The tale of Braveheart.

1101
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:08,355
Back then, the English king was evil,
he threw people out of castle windows.

1102
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,312
- I see.
- Everybody loved Braveheart.

1103
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:14,272
Even though there were rumours
that he were actually an Australian.

1104
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,311
Ah, interesting.

1105
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,238
But in the end,
he almost beat the English.

1106
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,157
Do you know this tale?

1107
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,988
Aye, laddie. I know this tale.

1108
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,998
I know this tale because...

1109
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:31,555
I am Braveheart!

1110
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,836
- You what?
- And you...

1111
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,952
you, Chris, are a Scotsman!

1112
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,638
Er, no, I'm not.

1113
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,240
- You are.
- No, really, I'm from Kent.

1114
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:45,511
Ha! Kent! Just look at those great 'ands.

1115
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,632
That's a mark o' a Highlander
if ever I saw one.

1116
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:51,513
Braveheart, we need your help.

1117
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,791
We need your help
and your lethal weapons.

1118
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:57,593
Would that be lethal weapon one,
two, three, or four?

1119
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,750
Will you join us in the fight for freedom?

1120
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,839
Aye.
But first there is something we must do.

1121
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,593
(Laughs)

1122
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,311
(Braveheart continues laughing)

1123
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:27,075
(Laughs) Now you're home, laddie!

1124
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:32,797
Freedo-o-o-om! (Echoes)

1125
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,516
They're up to something.

1126
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:50,313
They're definitely up to something.

1127
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,317
(Low droning)

1128
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,952
(Wind whistling)

1129
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:00,073
Bring me Churchill's head on a plate.

1130
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:02,315
Jawohl, Herr Himmler.

1131
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,518
(Whooshing)

1132
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,835
(Soldiers chanting, jackboots thudding)

1133
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:11,235
(Woman shouting orders in German)

1134
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,077
What in the name of?

1135
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,237
It's like the whole of hell has awoken.

1136
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,157
Shit on a stick.

1137
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,191
Artillery - feuer!

1138
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:28,232
Incoming!

1139
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:44,988
(Shell whistling)

1140
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:48,237
- (Engines revving)
- (Helga) Let's go, girls!

1141
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,350
Stand by for full armour attack.

1142
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,311
(Rupee) They're approaching the east wall.

1143
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,032
(Rupee) Hold the line!

1144
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:58,153
It's a bloody pack of wild
Bavarian banshee bitches!

1145
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,990
(Men shouting)

1146
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,713
(Heidi) Jawohl! Aaaah!

1147
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,239
They've breached the gates.

1148
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,271
(Helga) Deutschland! Deutschland!

1149
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,079
(Man shouting in German)

1150
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:26,957
(Man screams)

1151
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,232
(Man) Schnell! Schnell!

1152
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,319
Raus!

1153
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:35,193
(Roars) Die, you feather pickers!

1154
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,834
Ah! Take this! Take that! Ah!

1155
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,394
(Man) Das ist das Englischer Schwein!

1156
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,269
(Screams)

1157
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,995
- (Man) Watch the ladders!
- (English and Germans shouting)

1158
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:49,749
(Shell whistling)

1159
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,080
We're going to lose the wall, Tom.

1160
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:57,078
- Get ready to sound the retreat.
- Yes, sir.

1161
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,595
Sound the general retreat.

1162
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,116
Sound the general retreat!

1163
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,196
I retreat for no man!

1164
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,471
- Come on, Father, fall back!
- (Horn parping)

1165
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:20,798
Retreat, girls! Retreat to the catapult!

1166
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:23,274
Fall back, men! Jaldi, jaldi!

1167
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,469
(Shouting in German)

1168
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,673
I need someone to jump the propeller!

1169
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:34,280
Give me some cover! (Grunts)

1170
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,390
Covering fire!

1171
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,635
Get some o' this, baby, yeah!

1172
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,637
(Grunting)

1173
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,638
- (Gunfire)
- (Rupee) Take aim!

1174
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,671
Fire!

1175
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,750
Aargh!

1176
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,552
No!

1177
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,759
(Grunts)

1178
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,397
Oh, they've got Tom!

1179
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,998
Murderers!

1180
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,508
We're out of ammunition!
This is it!

1181
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:14,517
Well, well, it looks like we have won.

1182
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,274
Looks like poor Chris did not make it.

1183
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,231
I think this is the end.

1184
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,113
I am now ready to meet my maker.

1185
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:33,150
We fought bravely.

1186
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,714
We fought like Englishmen.

1187
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,751
(Woman shouting in German)

1188
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,236
Well, come on, then, damn it.

1189
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,919
What are you waiting for?

1190
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,951
(Man shouting in German)

1191
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,999
Oh, Chris, where are you?

1192
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,351
Chris!

1193
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,753
Ha-haa!

1194
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,472
(Rumbling)

1195
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:11,148
(Men roaring)

1196
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,797
Christopher.

1197
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,637
You made it, lad.

1198
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,272
(Sighs)

1199
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,958
- (Men yelling)
- (Churchill) He's done it.

1200
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,195
The boy's done it!

1201
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,470
He's brought us back an army!

1202
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,999
(Roars)

1203
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,190
(Men chanting) Och aye! Och aye!

1204
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:39,310
So the stories were true

1205
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,113
about men in skirts.

1206
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:44,071
(Roars)

1207
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:47,430
- (Scotsmen) Och aye! Och aye!
- (Yelling and laughing)

1208
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:50,870
Och aye! Och aye!

1209
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:54,310
Och aye! Och aye! Och aye!

1210
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,032
Och aye!

1211
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,277
I always knew the bastard
was one of them.

1212
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:02,756
(Chanting intensifies) Och aye! Och aye!
Och aye! Och aye! Och aye!

1213
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,030
Forward!

1214
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:08,356
(Yelling and angry muttering)

1215
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,958
(Screams)

1216
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,116
(Braveheart roars)

1217
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:26,788
(Munching)

1218
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:27,989
Nein!

1219
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,112
