ADMIRAL: Welcome. How are you?
DUKE: Good to see you, sir.

172
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,037
- Hello, captain.
- Somebody enjoyed himself in Australia.

173
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,952
Yes. Nice people down there, sir.

174
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,838
We're happy to be home too, sir.

175
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,236
ADMIRAL: Chief?
- Good afternoon, sir.

176
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,631
- What's the matter? You look worried.
- I lost one of my children, sir.

[MEN LAUGHING]

180
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,918
Shall we go below, gentlemen?

181
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,557
Sorry about your carrier, Pop.
We contacted the <i>Sarasota</i>...

182
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,633
...and her planes got the cruiser and
two destroyers. The carrier got away.

183
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,233
Better luck next patrol.

184
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,958
We'd have wrapped her up...

185
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,317
...except for those two prematures
that rattled our eyeteeth.

186
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,357
What will we do about the torpedoes?

187
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,317
DUKE:
Knocked the bottom out of my gang.

188
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,239
Those magnetic exploders
are driving us all crazy.

189
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,153
Everybody from the Bureau of Ordinance
on down is working on it.

190
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,880
We're doing something.
We're dropping them next patrol.

191
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,996
DUKE:
Good.

192
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,434
- We're going back to contact exploders.
- Maybe we can get a few hits now.

193
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,160
- Here's our patrol report, sir.
LARRY: Captain, captain.

194
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,958
- Yes.
LARRY: Sister Anna is leaving...

195
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,634
...and wants to say goodbye.
- Go ahead, Pop.

196
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,360
Duke, you brought them aboard.
You take the bow.

197
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,398
Bows we take together.

Bye! Bye!

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,432
- Bye-bye.
MAN: Take it easy.

200
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,797
Bye-bye. Be good.

201
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,953
- So long.
- Bye.

202
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,395
Bye.

203
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,957
Sister Anna, we've been looking
for you.

204
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,954
Cmdr. Gifford, we've been
wondering what to say after "thank you."

205
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,715
- Why don't you just let it go at that?
- It's been a pleasure to have you aboard.

206
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,189
Tonight in chapel, the words
will come to me.

207
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,039
I seem to think better
when I'm kneeling.

208
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,113
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

209
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,430
- What's the matter?
- Huh? Oh, nothing.

210
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,875
Well, don't you think
we'd better get below?

211
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,918
Yeah, just a minute. I'll be right back.

212
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,633
Oh, I'm sorry, nurse.
I thought she was...

213
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,349
I thought you were somebody else.
I beg your pardon.

214
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,633
Think you knew her?

215
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,155
Well, there was a nurse
in Darwin, and l...

00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,595
We better get below.

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,473
Hey, Butch. Butch.

00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,111
Butch.

220
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,955
Stop that. Do you wanna
have them all crying?

221
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,439
- No...
- Where's your mask?

222
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,953
- Mask?
- Over your nose.

223
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,839
- You're breathing germs in on them.
- Where's yours?

224
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,672
- Are you the baby's father?
- No...

225
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,353
You shouldn't be here. Leave.

226
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,239
I carried him through the jungle,
helped deliver him.

227
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,153
All right, now he's delivered.

228
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,314
As for the rest of it, may I remind you
that this is not the jungle? Good day.

229
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,638
Well, how do you like that?

230
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,430
All I wanna do is say hello to Butch,
and she comes charging in.

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,433
- Butch?
- Butch the ba...

232
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,158
I suppose you don't like Butch
for a name.

233
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,151
I suppose I love it.

234
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,914
I knew a Butch.

235
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,758
It's still there, huh?

236
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,036
- What?
- That old zing.

237
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,392
Of course it's still there, you big ape.
What do you think could happen to it?

238
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,393
Those things you said at the trial.

239
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,633
Do you think anybody ever tells the
real reason for a divorce at the trial?

240
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,950
What was the real reason?

241
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,951
Just now, when I kissed you...

242
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,756
...well, that's where we were
four years ago.

243
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,229
Hey, I'm proud of you.
Where did you train?

244
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,673
General Hospital, Durham.

245
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,559
What did the gentleman
from North Carolina say?

246
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,551
Dad was all for it.

247
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,996
I told him it was sort of a penance.

248
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,110
You felt like you should do penance?

249
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,636
Well, I felt like one of us should.

250
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,875
Penance.

251
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:35,114
I've been numb for four years,
trying to figure what happened to us.

252
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,720
We had something,
but I guess I kicked it around.

253
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,949
Why don't we pick up the pieces
and start over?

254
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,350
- What time do you get out of here?
- 6:30.

255
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,071
At 6:30, get your hat, coat, stick and
gloves, and we'll go out on the town.

256
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,719
- Wine?
- Wine, of course.

257
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,757
Remember that little hotel?

258
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,878
- The waiter asked about you...
- The waiter asked about you... You too?

259
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,598
Uh-huh.

260
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,753
After dinner, we'll dance a while,
then sneak away...

261
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,672
Duke, I've got a date.

262
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,717
- Break it.
- I can't.

263
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,713
It's with Bob Perry.
You would remember him.

264
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,754
Bob Perry? Little Bobby Perry?
Pop's kid brother?

265
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,038
- What makes you think he's such a kid?
- I used to pat him on the head.

266
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,156
- You seen him recently?
- No.

267
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,676
Next time you pat him on the head,
let me know. I wanna be there.

268
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,037
- We'll take care of that later. About...
- Duke, I got a date.

STEELE:
Lieutenant.

270
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,635
It's all right, commander.

271
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,870
This is my headache.

272
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,672
Oh.

273
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,920
Honey, I could never marry a submariner.
I like to sleep with the windows open.

274
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,596
- Mr. Caldwell is doing all right.
- He sure is.

275
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,756
Mmm. Tasty. Special?

276
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,559
I promised somebody
I'd buy wine tonight.

277
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,915
Here we go.

278
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,710
Say, what ever happened
to that kid brother of yours?

279
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,758
Bob? You'd never know him, Duke.

280
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,310
What a great, big, good-Iooking guy
he turned out to be.

281
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,830
And what he does to those gals.

282
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,958
He sure got all the glamour
in our family.

283
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,076
- Good evening.
- For two, please.

284
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,593
Right this way, please.

285
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,754
Look, Bob. It's Pop and Duke.

286
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,635
POP: Mary Stuart.
- Pop.

287
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,917
Bob. Duke, you remember Bob,
or don't you recognize him?

288
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,832
Oh, yes, fly-fly boy.

289
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,639
<i>Sara.</i> We got that cruiser for you.

290
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,400
If you run into any more good targets,
let us know.

291
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,869
- We'll take care of them.
POP: Don't say anything, Duke.

292
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,389
We can never hope for glory
like they get.

293
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,919
You realize that, huh?

294
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,150
We can do things
you pigboat boys can't.

295
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,719
Yes, sir, you sure can.

296
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,431
There's no record of a submarine sinking
one of our own planes by mistake.

297
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,831
- All right, all right.
- Sit. The wine's good. Duke's buying.

298
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,072
We'd like to, but Mary Stuart and I
were about to dance.

299
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,431
It's funny, but Mary Stuart and I
were just about to dance.

300
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,194
Well, what do you say, sugar?

301
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,479
Well, it's a very funny thing,
but I was just gonna ask Pop to dance.

302
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,108
Excuse us.

303
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,631
What's the matter, Cupid?

304
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,030
I read your wire.

305
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,398
- Have you been seeing a lot of Bob?
- Uh-huh.

306
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,829
So we level, like always?

307
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,036
- Like always, Pop.
- Good.

308
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,311
I think you and Duke belong together.

309
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,550
I don't know what's keeping
you apart...

310
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,311
...but I'd hate to think you were using
my kid brother to solve your problem.

311
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,112
Why didn't I meet you first, Pop?

312
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,235
Well, tell me about yourself. Pop hasn't
given me a rundown for quite a while.

313
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,153
Oh, I'm a big disappointment
to my brother.

314
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,029
When I decided against
that Navy career, I stabbed him.

315
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,954
- Well, what did you wanna be?
- What do you mean, "wanna be"? I am.

316
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,554
An architect. I build things.

317
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,235
You can't build much from 10,000 feet
with a load of bombs.

318
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,709
There's a war on.

319
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,556
You know, Duke,
I've always envied you.

320
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,518
When I was a high-school senior,
an all-city tackle...

321
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,592
...you ran 92 yards for a touchdown
to beat Army.

322
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,320
Then when I got to Stanford,
won the UCLA game...

323
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,596
...with a home run
in the ninth inning...

324
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,038
...papers were full of what a big man you
were at the raising of that sunken sub.

325
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,154
There were 400 dives on that job.
I made 10 of them.

326
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,154
I know, but you're the guy they talked
about. And then when I joined up...

327
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,233
...got my picture in the hometown paper,
they crowded me off in a corner...

328
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,518
...with a story about what a hero
you were at the bombing of Cavite.

329
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,514
And now, here we go again.

330
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,236
Aren't you dramatizing this a little?

331
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,960
No. It's different this time.

332
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,475
You're not the hero. You're the sucker.

333
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,918
Any man that would let Mary Stuart
get away from him is a sucker.

334
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,629
I see what you mean.

335
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,155
But as the fellow says:

336
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,632
"Like the ashes of Alexander,
I was once Alexander."

337
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,950
I'm not sure I get that.

338
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,236
But just to keep the record straight...

339
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,755
...Mary Stuart and I
are gonna be married.

340
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,751
- You told her that?
- Several times.

341
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,638
What did she say?

342
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,315
Well, she didn't say no.

343
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,915
Excuse me.

344
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,315
- Cutting in, captain.
- Sure, Duke, sure.

345
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,439
- You look wonderful. I always liked...
- The kid says he asked you to marry him.

346
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,716
How about it?

347
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,912
I had no idea it was so late.

348
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,430
Bob, I want to explain
a little situation to you.

349
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,717
- All right, Pop.
- You see...

350
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,758
- Will you get me back before curfew?
- Sure. Excuse me.

351
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,433
- Good night, Pop.
- Good night.

352
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,795
Good night, Duke.

353
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,588
Thanks for the wine.

354
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,072
BOB:
Big night for you.

355
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,798
Yes.

356
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,030
I enjoyed it.

357
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,711
He must be a nice guy.

358
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,838
Pop wouldn't like him,
and you wouldn't have married him.

359
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,911
So how's it with us?
Still the same?

360
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,555
I wonder if it's ever still the same
when a girl meets her ex-husband.

361
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,399
BOB:
I see what you mean.

362
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,553
I'll call you tomorrow.

363
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,597
Please do.

364
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,036
DUKE:
Mary Stuart.

365
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,118
MARY:
Duke.

366
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,396
You're still the softest-walking
man I ever heard.

367
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,996
Kid says he asked you
to marry him.

368
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,238
That's right.

369
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,913
Gonna do it?

370
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,918
I don't know.

371
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,517
He wants to go someplace
where they never heard of the Navy.

372
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,114
- And that appeals to you?
- His idea...

373
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,558
...is to fly back to Wichita, Kansas,
start walking inland with a pair of oars...

374
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,870
...and when we get to where
somebody says:

375
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,476
"What's that you got on your shoulders?"
That's it.

376
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,590
Just tell me one thing.

377
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,196
When you kiss him,
do you get that old zing?

378
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,432
Oh... Now you're talking
like a jealous husband.

379
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,670
Ex-husband,
and don't evade the question.

380
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,512
It's not a fair question.

381
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,148
A girl can't spend
the rest of her life kissing.

382
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,517
It's a good thing to fall back on
when you run out of talk.

383
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,115
If you wanted to be a nurse, you didn't
have to become a Navy nurse...

384
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,352
...and be sent to Pearl,
where you might see me.

385
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,472
Duke, I have a life
of my own to live.

386
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,712
I didn't want to live it
being afraid to run into you.

387
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,836
So you ran into me.

388
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,753
What now?

389
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,398
I don't know.

390
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,711
It's not as simple as I thought.

391
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,239
It took a war to make me understand...

392
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,312
...or maybe it's just
that I'm four years older...

393
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,835
...but there hasn't been a day
that you weren't with me...

394
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,717
...or a night...

395
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,599
...on patrol or ashore...

396
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:34,954
...in town or pushing some kids through
the jungles with a baby in my arms.

397
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,672
- Duke.
- Especially with that baby in my arms.

398
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,637
Duke, what good
will that kind of talk do now?

399
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,758
I'm trying to convince you
that I want another chance.

400
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,318
I haven't much time
to plead my cause.

401
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,518
I called a chaplain friend of mine
and asked him to stand by.

402
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,559
We could have a few days together
before I shove off.

403
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,755
Wait a minute.

404
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,033
I didn't spend these years to be
rushed off my feet by a white uniform...

405
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,236
...a big moon and ginger flowers.

406
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,879
Tree orchids.

407
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,393
You know what I mean.

408
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,758
You're thinking about the old zing,
but I'm thinking about the rest of my life.

409
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,638
I can't afford another mistake.

410
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,991
The only mistake you made
was in getting that divorce.

411
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,355
We're both grown up now.

412
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,875
We could have grown up together.

413
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,916
Maybe I wasn't around
a lot of times I should have been...

414
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,469
...but I guarantee you
that I'm gonna spend...

415
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,393
...all the time I have off duty
making it up to you.

416
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,118
CHIEF:
Commander.

417
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,319
Commander.

418
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,717
- What is it, chief?
- I'd like to speak to the commander, sir.

419
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,552
Excuse me, honey.

420
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,190
How did you know where I was?

421
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,398
- Chief.
- Good evening, ma'am.

422
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,835
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, lieutenant, ma'am.

423
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,989
What's the trouble?

424
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,035
Well, a bunch of the guys
went to a luau.

425
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,431
You know, a roast pig,
okolehao, fresh from the still...

426
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,828
...uh...

427
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,513
...hula girls...
- Yes, I know.

428
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,116
Well, you know Jonesy. The Hawaiian
police tried to break it up...

429
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,477
...then shore patrol got into it,
and somebody starts swinging.

430
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,234
They're being held
at the shore patrol station.

431
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,389
A friend phoned me.

432
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,238
Couldn't you get them out?

433
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,109
No, ma'am, on account of the Hawaiians.
They want damages.

434
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,792
- This may be serious.
- I know.

435
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,315
You'd better go take care of your Navy.

436
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,999
Go ahead.

437
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,832
Remember what I told you.

438
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,560
- I meant it. Let's go, chief.
CHIEF: Yes, sir.

439
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,437
[MEN SINGING]

440
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,238
- <i>Thunder</i> crew, belay that racket!
HAWAIIAN: My guitar, commander.

441
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,039
Please, commander. Look at my guitar!

442
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,678
Hello, Mick.

443
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,200
- You booked them yet, chief?
MAN 1: Well, no, sir, we...

444
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,870
We haven't booked them, because we
haven't figured out all the charges yet.

445
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,076
- That bad, huh?
- Worse.

446
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,630
- It's hard to believe.
- Do you think they belong in a nursery?

447
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,109
Think I've got them there
for stealing dolls?

448
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,157
Give me that report, chief.

449
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,673
"In car number one,
we were cruising near Koko Head."

450
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,400
That's five miles
out-of-bounds, incidentally.

451
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,314
"Our attention was attracted to a
disturbance involving naval personnel.

452
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,438
Investigation disclosed a dozen
of the <i>Thunder</i> crew at a luau.

453
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,276
The Hawaiians tried to get them to leave.
They became noisy and belligerent.

454
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,637
When the Hawaiians sent
the hula girls home, a fight started."

455
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,360
I'd like to talk to the man
that made that report.

456
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,755
You'll have to go to the naval hospital.

457
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,354
He's in there with five of my best men.

458
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,555
You submariners are practically
winning this war single-handed...

459
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,395
...but I don't see how fighting patrolmen
is going to weaken the Japs.

460
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,353
There must have been great
provocation for my gang...

461
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,717
...if it was my gang.
- Lf it was your gang?

462
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,394
Bring those guys
from the <i>Thunderfish</i> out here.

463
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,232
JAILER:
Come on, you thunderbirds.

464
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,271
Oh, no.

465
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,908
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

466
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,432
CHIEF:
What? I want a story here.

467
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,953
Hurry it up!

468
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,430
Wipe those smiles off your face.
Lively, now!

469
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,032
Hurry it up.

470
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,392
Right. Hey!

471
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,591
DUKE: Jonesy.
- Yes, sir?

472
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,274
- Did you engineer this?
- No, sir.

473
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,590
Natural causes.

474
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,430
Could I talk to you
privately, commander?

475
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,194
You can talk to me,
but it won't do you any good.

476
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,754
Fighting men, huh?

477
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,559
Not even the admiral
could get you out of this one.

478
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,917
- Now, let's be reasonable about this...
- No, no, not a chance.

479
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,117
I'd like to help you, Duke,
but it's gotta stop someplace.

480
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,558
Night after night, my men
are getting knocked down.

481
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,269
If it isn't <i>Thunder,</i> it's <i>Tang</i> or
<i>Silversides</i> or <i>Oahu</i> or <i>Growler.</i>

482
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,192
- What makes you submariners...?
- Listen.

483
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,512
- They have been out on a tough patrol.
- I know, you brought back some children.

484
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,433
- And two nuns.
- That still doesn't excuse the...

485
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,389
Nuns, did you say?

486
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,994
And the kids don't know it,
but they're going right out again.

487
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,993
All right.

488
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,479
I'll make a deal with you.

489
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,598
I'll forget my end if you can
fix the damages with the Hawaiians.

490
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,156
- How much do they want?
- $233.50.

491
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:35,553
$233.50? There isn't that much
in the whole crew, including the officers!

492
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,598
- It's the best I can do.
JUNIOR: Let me out, let me out!

493
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,870
Take it easy, kid!

494
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,868
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't know, sir.

495
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,033
- Something went click, and here I am.
- He was hit over the head with a bottle.

496
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,270
- A bottle of what?
- Okolehao, sir.

497
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,750
- Okolehao, huh?
- Yes, sir.

498
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,388
Intoxicating liquor.

499
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,912
Throw these men in the brig
for selling bootleg okolehao to my crew.

500
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,157
Please, commander, please.

00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,996
Wish I had something to tell her.

670
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,594
- Have her come in, Dick.
DICK: Yes, sir.

671
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,751
The admiral is in the plotting room.

672
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,676
- I'm sorry to bother you, admiral, but...
- Oh, that's all right. Come in anytime.

673
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,198
No word, sir?

674
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,910
But that doesn't mean she's lost.

675
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:01,116
- But no word.
- She's a sturdy boat with a fine crew.

676
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,475
They'll bring her in if she's afloat.

677
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,271
Thank you, sir.

678
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,315
No luck, sir.
The set's damaged too bad.

679
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,629
Keep trying.

680
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,234
Engineer and
first lieutenant's reports, sir.

681
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,513
All hands.

682
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,079
Here's the story.

683
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,118
The damage to our bow
has cut our surface speed in half.

684
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,238
We can submerge,
but we can't make much headway.

685
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,630
Means we'll do most
of our running at night.

686
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:51,632
<i>We'll be a little late getting back to Pearl,</i>
<i>but sit tight. We'll make it.</i>

687
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,149
<i>That's all.</i>

688
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,595
<i>And Ma in her kerchief</i>
<i>And I in my cap</i>

689
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,548
<i>Had just settled ourselves</i>
<i>For a long winter's nap</i>

690
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,796
What are we waiting for?
That huddle in the wardroom?

691
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,988
Board of Investigation has to decide what
happened before anybody goes ashore.

692
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,391
A faulty torpedo
cost Capt. Perry his life.

693
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,949
Otherwise, the target
would have been disabled.

694
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,588
The <i>Thunder</i> wouldn't have been
forced into a dive.

695
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,478
After the dive...

696
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,872
After the dive, I acted according to my
understanding of the <i>Thunder</i>'s mission...

697
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,874
...which was to destroy enemy shipping.
- After the Jap ship went down...

698
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,237
...we cruised the area,
searching for Capt. Perry.

699
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,198
What was the condition
of the <i>Thunder</i> at that time?

700
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:46,318
Heavily damaged.
Barely able to make headway, sir.

701
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,440
You performed
an outstanding submarine feat...

702
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,830
...in getting the <i>Thunder</i> back.
- Thank you.

703
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,197
You've had a rough patrol
and need a little time to unwind...

704
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,318
...so we are recommending
you be sent back to the States.

705
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:06,235
- I'd rather stay and see to the <i>Thunder.</i>
- I'm sorry. That's our recommendation.

706
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,717
- Jonesy...
- Nothing doing, Junior.

707
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,792
I've got business that's gonna
keep me busy for days.

708
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,634
Not now, I'm heading for
a hot bath and a bottle.

709
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,759
- Hey, Mosconi.
- I'd love to, but I'm always booked solid.

710
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,150
- Hey, chief.
- Not now, Junior, not now.

711
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,116
[ORGAN PLAYS]

712
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,237
Why didn't you tell me?

713
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,753
I didn't know all these guys
would be here.

714
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,311
I just dropped in.

715
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,398
Looks like a lot of us
had the same idea.

716
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,634
I guess it's up to me
to say something.

717
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,718
The most appropriate thing
I can think of...

718
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:10,359
...is the last part of the burial at sea
in the <i>Navy Prayer Book.</i>

719
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,758
It goes like this:

720
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:17,555
"We commend their souls to God
and commit their bodies to the deep...

721
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:21,235
...in sure and certain hope of
the resurrection into eternal life...

722
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,870
...through Jesus Christ, at whose
coming to judge the world...

723
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,110
...the sea shall give up her dead."

724
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,511
Pop wasn't killed in action.

725
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,110
Duke took that boat
down from under him.

726
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,829
I know how you must feel,
but how do you suppose Duke feels?

727
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:42,074
He was responsible for the safety
of the <i>Thunder</i> and the lives of the crew.

728
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,310
BOB:
So he took it down where it was safe...

729
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,789
...but he didn't stay down
where it was safe.

730
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,952
He brought it up again to fight. Why?

731
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,315
I'm not the only one asking questions.

732
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,436
They're sending him back. Why?

733
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,959
I don't know, Bob...

734
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,759
...but I'm sure Duke did
what he thought was right.

735
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,269
Don't try to defend him, Mary Stuart.

736
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,035
Nothing means a thing to Duke
except the chance to be a hero again.

737
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,753
Bob.

738
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:10,637
I was over at your quarters,
looking for you.

739
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:14,634
I wanted to tell you about Pop,
how we all felt.

740
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,352
What's the use of talking?

741
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,557
All I can think
of is Pop out there, helpless...

742
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,951
...while you went glory hunting.

743
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,789
Too bad.

744
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,870
Don't be upset, darling.

745
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:43,316
Let's sit down over here,
and you can tell me what happened.

746
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,789
In time, Bob will forgive you.

747
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,916
Forgive me? For what?

748
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,436
We didn't abandon Pop.

749
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,068
He ordered the <i>Thunder</i> down,
knowing he couldn't make it.

750
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,196
Knowing she would be under
in a minute.

751
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,715
He gave his life
for his crew and his boat.

752
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,111
Bob doesn't understand that.
After all, Pop was his brother.

753
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,194
And he was my best friend.
I'm gonna miss him.

754
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:08,875
His kindness and his gruff humor...

755
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:12,828
...but the missing is all mixed-up
with such a fierce pride in what he did...

756
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,958
...that I have no room for mourning.
I think Pop understands.

757
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,429
Of course, but that
doesn't lessen the hurt.

758
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,592
Wait a minute. I told you how I feel.

759
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,877
If you're offering me a shoulder
to cry on, I don't need it.

760
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,952
- I have nothing to cry about.
- I'm only trying to help.

761
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:29,519
You can't help me in this.

762
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:33,235
My problem is to stay aboard
the <i>Thunder</i> and keep the crew together.

763
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,796
I had better get started on it right now.

764
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,634
See you later.

765
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,078
STEELE:
What is the matter?

766
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,550
I guess I know now where I stand.

767
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:10,709
DUKE: Is the admiral in, Joe?
- Yes, sir. I think he's expecting you.

768
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:17,437
- Capt. Gifford of the <i>Thunderfish,</i> sir.
ADMIRAL: Come in, Duke.

769
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,676
- Thank you for seeing me, sir.
- Sit down, relax.

770
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,239
What can I do for you?

771
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,198
I would like to talk to you, sir,
about the <i>Thunder.</i>

772
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:30,035
I could say that the crew
was so well-coordinated...

773
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,158
...that it should be kept intact,
and that would be true.

774
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:37,916
I could tell you about Pop,
and the promise I made to him.

775
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,594
- There's a lot...
- What are you trying to tell me?

776
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:44,309
- I don't wanna go back to the States.
- You had a strenuous time.

777
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:48,871
I know they said that, sir,
but I thought perhaps you could...

778
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,918
Well, there is one possibility
for you to stay.

779
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,117
I've been given permission
to conduct experiments out here.

780
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,714
Find out why our torpedoes
don't explode.

781
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,758
I wouldn't be any good for that, sir.
I'm no theory man.

782
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,434
I'm a line officer.
I belong aboard the <i>Thunder.</i>

783
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,070
You're a practical submariner,
and this is a big job.

784
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,912
However...

785
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,195
MAN:
<i>Flag lieutenant, sir.</i>

786
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:13,670
Arrange transportation
for Capt. Gifford to the States.

787
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,637
I hadn't finished, sir.

788
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,633
What I meant to say was,
I belong aboard a boat...

789
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:22,554
...but I'll do anything I can.

790
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,392
I thought you'd feel that way.

791
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,119
I gather from Pop's messages...

792
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,350
...that he had ideas
about what was wrong.

793
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,717
Yes, sir. He started to explain
to me but never finished.

794
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,678
Do you think anybody aboard
the <i>Thunder</i> has any ideas?

795
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,159
Well, my chief might.

796
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,470
The whole crew are fine torpedo men.

797
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,950
Go in a huddle with the torpedo officer.
See what you can cook up.

798
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,509
- We'll give you all the help we can.
- Thank you.

799
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,035
It's all right, Duke.
Find the answer for me.

800
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,510
You know, I don't enjoy
sending out boats and crews...

801
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,478
...with torpedoes
that don't get the job done.

802
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,517
Aye, aye, sir.

803
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,997
- It looks all right here in the shop.
- But it doesn't explode.

804
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,549
The brain trust has figured out
the force of impact.

805
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:32,235
If we could approximate the tons
with which this hits the ship...

806
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,598
Why don't you take it
up high someplace and drop it?

807
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,517
No luck. Ten straight duds.

808
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,955
- That sends me back to the States.
- Me too.

809
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,634
This thing is a must for the admiral.

810
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,314
Chief, is there anything we haven't tried?

811
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:36,472
No, sir, except
those aluminum firing pins...

812
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,915
...the base sent over,
but they look too light.

813
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,918
DUKE: Put one in.
MAN 1: Yes, sir.

814
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,032
CHIEF:
Stand clear.

815
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:02,879
Let her go!

[EXPLOSION]

817
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:13,355
MAN 2: That did it, chief.
MAN 3: Yes, sir.

818
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:59,031
Hold it right there. Turn around,
and give me all the angles.

819
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,437
Then get your hat, coat and gloves
because we're going out.

820
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,632
- I've got something to say.
- But do you have to say it now?

821
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,633
- I've got big things...
- Yes. I'm not going to enjoy it...

822
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,635
...and I want to get it over with.
No, please don't touch me. Just listen.

823
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,759
The last time I saw you was probably
the most unselfish moment in my life.

824
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:21,674
I was practically glowing
with things I wanted to do for you...

825
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,400
...but you didn't give me a chance.
- I'm sorry...

826
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,313
Now everything's cleared up.
You want somebody to howl with you.

827
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:31,598
- I don't want just somebody, I want you.
- I'm not available, Duke.

828
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:37,039
That night in front of the nurses' quarters
and then again at the pier...

829
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:40,636
...I forgot for the moment
why we split up...

830
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,758
...but you reminded me,
and the trouble came charging back.

831
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:47,799
It wasn't the Navy, the wet winters,
the bad quarters or you being away.

832
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,400
Those things made it wonderful
when you got home.

833
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:55,314
Sure, we did.
We had some great times together...

834
01:10:55,480 --> 01:11:00,429
...but a marriage isn't all laughs.
I wanted to cry with you sometimes too.

835
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:04,479
I wanted to comfort you
when you lost your best friend...

836
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,839
...but you wouldn't let me.

837
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,989
I wanted to comfort you
when we lost our son...

838
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:17,358
...but you went off into some corner
of your own, never realizing...

839
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:21,069
...by comforting you,
I could have helped my own grief.

840
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,430
Maybe it's my fault.

841
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,114
Maybe I shouldn't have
let you shut me out...

842
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,350
...but you have no corner on pride, Duke.

843
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:37,116
If I can't be a part of everything
in your life, I can't be a part of anything.

844
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,428
So there is...

845
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,713
...trouble between us.

846
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,833
You don't need me, Duke.

847
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,589
You never have.

848
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,756
You don't need anybody but yourself.

849
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:23,477
- Fine boy.
- Yeah.

850
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,108
Take good care of him, will you?

851
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,952
A man has got a lot to learn.

852
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:38,838
[BABY CRIES]

853
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:03,029
STEELE: I heard every word you said.
I've been trying to keep my nose out...

854
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:06,397
...but I can't stand by
and watch you make a fool of yourself.

855
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,348
- Cmdr. Steele, I know...
- Keep quiet and listen.

856
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,309
Of course he comes to you
when he wants to play.

857
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,789
Where do you want him to go,
some other woman?

858
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,839
You married him for what he is and
tried to make something else out of him.

859
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,039
When you couldn't, and you never will,
you began to feel sorry for yourself.

860
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,510
How long would you love him
if he did cry on your shoulder?

861
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,513
"You don't need me."
"I shouldn't have let you shut me out."

862
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:35,798
What kind of silly talk is that?
And what has pride got to do with love?

863
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,636
Don't worry. He won't be happy...

864
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,469
...but what is more important,
he won't be back.

865
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,429
DUKE:
Keep your seat.

866
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,912
What's the matter, Junior?
Getting some fresh air?

867
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,593
No, sir.

868
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,638
I was just sitting up here,
thinking about women.

869
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,519
How you miss them
till you get ashore...

870
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,955
...and then how you wonder why.

871
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:41,797
- How soon you start missing them again.
- I reckon it's just a vicious circle.

872
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,111
That's a cynical observation
for a gentleman from Georgia.

873
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,550
- Alabama, sir.
- Oh, I beg your pardon.

874
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:50,280
Of course, sir.

875
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,870
There's a lot of you corn bread
and buttermilk boys in the Navy...

876
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:56,679
...yet that doesn't seem
to be sailor country.

877
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,637
Oh, but it is, sir.

878
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,028
From way back.

879
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,472
My great-grandpappy
was on the <i>Merrimac.</i>

880
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:06,837
My grandpappy
was with Dewey at Manila.

881
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,879
My pappy was with Adm. Sims
chasing U-boats.

882
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:15,238
Why, even the town I come from
is named Decatur.

883
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,430
Indications lead to an all-out
Japanese effort...

884
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,751
...to destroy the recently obtained
United States base at Leyte...

885
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,559
...and prevent support and supply
by our fleet.

886
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:34,679
The Imperial Japanese fleet is known
to have left its base, headed south.

887
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,877
Several courses are open to them.

888
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,077
Consequently, initial contact
is of vital importance.

889
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:44,677
Our submarines are located
along this general line.

890
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,596
DUKE:
And it's our job to locate them.

891
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:53,558
- You think the Japs will gamble like that?
MAN: They'll have to.

892
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,995
The Philippine landing
was a ticklish job.

893
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:59,118
We bypassed a lot of places
to jump in there.

894
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,953
If they let us stay,
they're gone geese.

895
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:04,759
- What is it, Mr. Caldwell?
- Message from the <i>Corvina.</i>

896
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:08,117
They got gear trouble
and want to know if we can help.

897
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:11,590
Check with the engineer officer.
If we can, arrange a rendezvous.

898
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,796
Aye, aye, sir.

899
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,396
How long have you been out, Freddie?

900
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,991
Sixty days.
Didn't even see a rowboat.

901
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:35,113
Did you guys bring
any new pictures with you?

902
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,392
We've got a thing
called <i>George Washington Slept Here.</i>

903
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:42,712
- Got anything to trade?
FREDDIE: We have a submarine picture.

904
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:46,595
- It sure is exciting.
- Well, send it over...

905
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:49,991
...and you can have
<i>George Washington Slept Here</i>...

906
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,479
...and six points.

907
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:06,755
- Hey, Joe! Do me a favor, will you?
- Sure!

908
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,829
When you get back to Pearl,
go up to Room 202.

under the pillow, it's mine.

If there's a buck under the pillow,
I'll split it with you.

There will be movies tonight.

912
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:03,871
- How's the picture?
- Oh, all right, I guess, sir.

913
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:07,828
The things those Hollywood guys
can do with a submarine.

914
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,232
I wonder how Freddie's doing
with <i>George Washington.</i>

915
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:18,070
I can't figure out
those explosions Sound reported.

- Torpedoes, yes.

- What's that for?
- Nothing.

1156
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:43,910
I couldn't help it about the chief, sir.

1157
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,638
You're remembering how
he took care of you.

1158
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:50,597
Yes, sir.

1159
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:53,911
But before you, he took care of Larry.

1160
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:56,833
Before Larry, he took care of me.

1161
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:01,312
Before me, it was Pop. Before Pop...

01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:07,393
Chiefs have been taking care of this
man's Navy for a long time, Mr. Caldwell.

1163
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,194
Don't worry about him.

1164
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:14,399
He's got a lot of good sailors
to take care of back there.

The tonnage of this patrol
was close to a record.

Yes, sir.

1168
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:55,471
Excuse me, sir.

1169
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:08,876
- It's still there, huh?
- What?

1170
01:44:09,040 --> 01:44:11,235
- The old zing.
- Of course it is.

1171
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:13,994
What could have happened to it?

1172
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:21,115
- I got your message.
- What message?

1173
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:25,156
Let's go get Butch.
