What is this place called?

555
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,207
Malmaison, General.
The bad house.

556
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,839
In memory of the barbaric Normans

557
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,645
who raided the place many years ago.

Where did you learn to run a house?

564

In the West indies, when
you were a little savage?

565
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:36,404

appreciated beauty.

00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,875

for a country house.

You're not paying for it.

569
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,612
Certainly not.

570

less for your family.

You can't accuse me of
neglecting my family.

your welfare above my own.

Soon, it will smell
of joy, of life, of love.

581
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,368
Do you know that when I was a child,

582
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,932
a fortune teller
predicted that one day,

583
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,776
I was going to be
greater than a queen?

584
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:52,577
Today, I have the
feeling she saw right.

585

This is my palace.

00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,214
And you will be the king.

Husband is good enough.
I don't like kings.

You think we would be mad
to buy it, don't you?

589
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,999
I think 300,000 francs
is a lot of money

590
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,500
for a general living on his pay.

591
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,265
Yes, but you're worth much
more, because if you wanted...

592
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:17,273
You don't have to say it.
Talleyrand already did.

593
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:18,865
The French have had enough

594
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,002
of being governed by
men who are corrupt.

595
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:23,569
But they are not ready to rise up.

596
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,275
Perhaps for now, your
interest is to avoid anything

597
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,511
that could tarnish
the glory you won in ltaly.

598
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:31,419

You say that as if you already
have a glimmer of an idea.

604
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,525
Because holding Egypt

605
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,571
means cutting off
England's route to lndia,

of incredible wealth.

621
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,629
Didn't you know that
the pharaohs built a canal

626
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:41,540
this prodigious work

Hmm, without any doubt.

631
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:53,082
If we started excavating
in this area,

632
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,625
we'd unearth marvels that

Yet a better idea would
be to dig another canal.

Joseph are going to propose.

when Murat comes
to ask you for my hand.

916

Until then, I entreat
you to accept his help!

917

Caroline is right.

920

The plan is audacious,
Napoleon. But it can work.

921
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:23,525
We've based it on two factors.

922
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:27,262
First, the people hate
the current government.

923
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:29,964
And two, they see you as a hero.

924

You want to overthrow the Directoire?

925
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:33,465
It wouldn't take much of a push.

926

And in its place, Napoleon Bonaparte?

927
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:38,871
You've always kept your
distance from politics.

928

You have managed
to keep your hands clean!

You are the godsend
the whole country is waiting for!

930

France is so weak now.

another revolution.

would make the most of it!

Who said anything about a revolution?

934
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:58,992
Everything will be done
perfectly legally!

935
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:01,798
We just have to persuade the deputies

936
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:06,274
to elect a new government,
and get rid of the Directory,

937
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,310
and elect in its place
a new government,

938
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:10,470
composed of three irreproachable men.

939
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:12,776
Sieyes, Roger-Ducos, and you.

940
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:20,217
It's possible.

941
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:24,157
If you were to assemble all
the deputies for a special session,

942
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:25,353
somewhere isolated

943
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:28,955
where the army could
bring pressure to bear,

944
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,431
if needed, without triggering
a riot in the city.

945
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,592
That's perfect.

946
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:35,262
And with Murat
at the head of the troops,

947
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:36,327
we can't fail.

948
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:38,635
I suggest
Chateau de St. Cloud.

949
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,176
It's far enough from Paris,
and easy to control.

950
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,643
I agree.

951
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:45,442
Can we assume that you
approve of our little project?

952

Your little project,

953

as you call it so discreetly,
my dear Joseph,

954
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:51,587
is nothing less than a coup d'etat.

955
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:55,715
If it fails, we will end
up in prison, at best,

956
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:57,759
and more likely under the blade.

957
01:04:57,827 --> 01:05:00,387
Are you still so sure
that Murat will follow us?

958
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:02,988
I can speak for him
as I do for myself.

959
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,692
He'll only want to know in what name

960

In what name?

In the name of reality.

Louis XVIII is ready to enter Paris.

964
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:15,876
If we delay, the Republic
will be lost,

and with it all the benefits
of the Revolution.

966
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:22,477
That's reason enough
to risk everything.

to check everything

what my associates and I decide on.

975

In other words, you're
asking me to support a plot?

I don't consider ridding the country

swindlers to be a plot.

haven't forgotten

of their followers

shot point-blank

to dig their own graves.

into your confidence?

where his interest lies.

from me, and he's right.

When we imprison a man,

1259
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:46,298
it's usually because
he has broken the law.

The First Consul should look
after the affairs of state
