No idea.

7
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:18,283
You know, he's got a funny accent, but...

8
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,986
I don't think it's Russian.

9
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,554
Russian?

10
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:26,858
Yeah. Didn't you see the
writing on the boat over there?

Mm-hmm. [Chuckles]

00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:00,199
Well, I haven't seen you since Baltimore.

168

I heard rumor that you were still with us.

169
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:04,870
Yeah, well, when I heard
you were headed south,

170
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:07,472
I figured hitch a ride, go by water.

171
00:08:07,474 --> 00:08:09,074
It's faster, and the food's much better.

172
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:11,043
That's bullshit.

173
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:13,879
You care for these people
more than you choose to admit.

174
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:17,015
Oh, easy, killer. You don't have
to get so lathered up about it.

I'm not lathered.

00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:24,691
You're glad I'm back.

178
00:08:25,993 --> 00:08:28,860
Curious to know why you
left in the first place.

179
00:08:28,862 --> 00:08:31,029
Be mildly intrigued to know

180
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:35,767
where you went off to, who you went off to.

181
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:40,540
But that, I suppose, would
be a lot of questions.

182
00:08:42,242 --> 00:08:45,115
It's a lot of questions.

183
00:08:50,117 --> 00:08:53,485
She's my daughter.

184
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:57,355
Last I heard, she was in Jackson.

185
00:08:57,357 --> 00:08:59,224
How old is she?

186
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:02,628
14. Lives with her mother.

187
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,033
Haven't seen her in three years.

188
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:09,935
We'll be near Jackson soon enough.

189
00:09:09,937 --> 00:09:14,606
Yeah. I think I'll take
it one day at a time.

190
00:09:14,608 --> 00:09:16,675
- [Sighs]
- Hey, Doc,

191
00:09:16,677 --> 00:09:21,681
I'm ever in the ring,
you can work my corner.

192
00:09:23,183 --> 00:09:25,050
Tex.

193
00:09:25,052 --> 00:09:26,288
Yeah?

194
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,293
Thanks for telling me.

195
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:36,898
Yeah.

196
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,961
Jeter: As you know, we will
be landing soon in Norfolk.

197
00:09:42,963 --> 00:09:46,831
We've put out a call over ham
radio and shortwave for pilots.

198
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:50,235
The hope is, with planes,
pilots, scientists, and doctors,

199
00:09:50,237 --> 00:09:53,171
we can get the labs in America
and possibly even overseas

200
00:09:53,173 --> 00:09:57,375
up and running and getting
real distribution of the cure.

201
00:09:57,377 --> 00:10:00,645
Also be sending out six land
teams with a twofold mission...

202
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:02,714
find survivors in the general population

203
00:10:02,716 --> 00:10:04,716
and find our families.

204
00:10:04,718 --> 00:10:07,185
Those with loved ones in
Norfolk will be assigned

205
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:10,555
to the sectors corresponding
to their neighborhoods.

206
00:10:10,557 --> 00:10:12,157
For those who live
elsewhere in the country,

207
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,538
we can only promise your
time will come soon enough.

208
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,643
That's a S.E.A.L.

209
00:10:31,645 --> 00:10:33,721
Signal back.

210
00:10:42,723 --> 00:10:45,490
I see more S.E.A.L.s.

211
00:10:45,492 --> 00:10:48,460
You make out any pilots?

212
00:10:48,462 --> 00:10:50,228
Yes.

213
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,736
Yes, I do.

214
00:10:57,738 --> 00:10:59,075
Man: Secure that line!

215

Damon: Me and my team were
stationed up in Little Creek.

216
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,747
When shit went down, we went inland.

217
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:10,782
We only made it back here a few weeks ago.

218
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:14,052
We got 34 military personnel
in town as far as we can tell...

219
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:17,322
some army, some marines, but mostly Navy.

220
00:11:17,324 --> 00:11:21,126
Our intel says there's a
biosafety level 4 lab on base here.

221
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:24,062
There was, but the
equipment got moved someplace

222
00:11:24,064 --> 00:11:26,197
and no one here can tell us where.

223
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:28,667
We've been trying to divide
the city into sectors,

224
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:30,302
impose a level of control.

225
00:11:30,304 --> 00:11:32,470
We got people holed up in
different safe houses...

226
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:35,073
school gym, supermarkets,

227
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:37,075
some of them even running
on diesel generators.

228
00:11:37,077 --> 00:11:38,877
I don't know if we found them all yet,

229
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,079
but we're still in the
process of clearing the city.

230
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:43,748
My people are about to head out there soon,

231
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,617
try to find their families.

232
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:48,887
Any information I can
give them ahead of time

233
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:50,829
will be much appreciated.

234
00:11:57,831 --> 00:12:00,565
Captain says the S.E.A.L.s didn't recognize

235
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:02,367
any of the names on the list.

236
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:03,802
Had to figure that, right?

237
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:06,444
It doesn't mean anything, ma'am.

238
00:12:12,446 --> 00:12:14,913
How you doing?

239
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:16,915
Nervous. You?

240
00:12:16,917 --> 00:12:18,790
Terrified.

00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:30,398
Chandler: We have labs, we have scientists,

242
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,700
and we have you.

243
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:37,539
We get this right, with
our ship covering the south

244
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,741
and everybody spreading not just the cure

245
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:41,810
but the knowledge of how to make it,

246
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:44,479
we can turn the tide,

247
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:46,614
not just here,

248
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:48,416
but in Europe...

249
00:12:48,418 --> 00:12:50,285
and then the world.

250
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:55,056
We've all waited a long
time for this day to come.

251
00:12:55,058 --> 00:12:57,625
It's here.

Dad made this happen.

261

As they'll ever be.

265

Move them out.

00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:52,206
Aye.

I already found mine.

275
00:15:23,997 --> 00:15:26,064
Now she's gone,

276
00:15:27,066 --> 00:15:29,273
and all that's left is what she became.

277
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:40,111
This situation brings
out the worst in people,

278
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:42,380
but it also brings out the best.

279
00:15:42,382 --> 00:15:47,818
Part of me wanted to
just stay in Baltimore,

281
00:15:52,558 --> 00:15:54,959
But how could I,

282
00:15:54,961 --> 00:15:57,561
after what she did there?

283
00:15:57,563 --> 00:15:59,864
Your place is here, with your shipmates.

My own bunkmate won't even look at me.

After what my mother did to her...

287
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:08,906
Well, maybe she just doesn't
know how to talk about it,

288
00:16:08,908 --> 00:16:11,242
because I can tell you,
no one here blames you.

289
00:16:11,244 --> 00:16:14,245
I know that you're supposed to say that,

290
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:15,946
but we walked into that mess

291
00:16:15,948 --> 00:16:17,848

than the captain right now.

you're just gonna want to
stick it on the hook right here.

How did you get here?!
Where have you been?!

My ship. [Chuckles]

361
00:20:34,206 --> 00:20:36,440
We have the cure.

00:20:36,442 --> 00:20:38,208
What?

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,110
We have the cure, Mom.

[Both laughing]

365
00:20:41,714 --> 00:20:44,617

Curtis: Hey.

368
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:06,194
Hey!

369
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:10,132
Hmm? Hey.

370
00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:13,101
- Why ain't you sick?
- Hmm?

371
00:21:13,103 --> 00:21:16,338
You've been sleeping in that diseased
sleeping bag almost a week now.

372
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,073
- Diseased?
- Yeah, man.

373
00:21:18,075 --> 00:21:20,609
The sleeping bag.

374
00:21:20,611 --> 00:21:23,178
Guy died in it two
hours before you got here

375
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,013
from the virus.

376
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:26,948
Why ain't you sick?

377
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,817
Well, I suppose

378
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:33,255
I have to ask you just the same thing.

379
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:36,525
Dr. Hunter: We haven't had any contact
with anyone from Washington since September.

380
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:38,760
How are you holding up?

381
00:21:38,762 --> 00:21:41,963
Well, besides the fact that
the whole world is dying,

382
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:44,666
I haven't left this compound in four months

383
00:21:44,668 --> 00:21:46,068
with the same six people...

384
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,136
Well, it seems like we might be seeing you

385
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:50,172
sooner than we thought

386
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:52,307
now that there's no lab here.

389
00:21:55,446 --> 00:21:57,646
[All cheer] Any word on Phoenix?

390
00:21:57,648 --> 00:22:00,115
Mason: Arrived at the lab at 16:46, sir.

391
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:02,951
Topeka group settled in their lab, sir.
Still waiting on confirmation from Madison.

392
00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:05,187
- And in Europe?
- Radio range is weak, but you can see the beacons.

393
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:09,124
The thing is, I, um, I seem
to have lost track of Michael.

394
00:22:09,126 --> 00:22:12,628
I don't suppose he's reached out to you?

395
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,663
He said that he might.

396
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:18,934
I did hear from him, uh,
but that was months ago.

397
00:22:18,936 --> 00:22:20,335
Where was he?

398
00:22:20,337 --> 00:22:21,870
In China.

Still in China.

402
00:22:27,277 --> 00:22:30,378
He, uh, he was covering the story there,

403
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,014
which was horrific.

404
00:22:33,016 --> 00:22:35,517
- Was he gonna try to get out?
- I encouraged him to.

405
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:38,153
Uh, believe me, Rachel, I...

406
00:22:38,155 --> 00:22:40,222
- but I don't know.
- It's getting closer to Lisbon.

Show me.

Right here.

418
00:23:37,447 --> 00:23:39,447
Why did they leave?

Why did they all leave?

The only thing I can think of is,

421
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:46,702

everybody just took off.

Can you believe I haven't
had a drink in five months?

I saw all your bottles gone.

427

Thought maybe it went the other way.

Not a drop.

It's the real thing.

- Hi. It's nice to meet you.
- Hi. You too.

You know your mother's the glue
that holds this place together?

00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:36,638
Seriously.

That is not the woman you described to me.

439
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:46,681
I know. It's amazing.

440
00:24:46,683 --> 00:24:48,750
I noticed that you
introduced me as your friend.

441
00:24:48,752 --> 00:24:50,752
I didn't exactly know what to call you.

442
00:24:50,754 --> 00:24:54,322
I mean, boyfriend doesn't quite cut it.

443
00:24:54,324 --> 00:24:55,824
What about the baby?

You're not gonna tell her about that?

00:24:58,795 --> 00:25:02,330
Can't.

446
00:25:02,332 --> 00:25:05,901
Because she'd ask you to stay?

447
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:07,235
Because if she asked,

448
00:25:07,237 --> 00:25:14,676
I might have to say yes.

haven't met any resistance,

Yates, Heller, and Moralez
found their families.

452

So, that makes four.

to remain with the crew on mission,

your permission to stay here

leave their families.

No, sir.

feasible to bring them on board.

what our position was going to be on that.

465
00:25:49,346 --> 00:25:52,948
That's because I haven't known what to do.

as soon as they're ready,

- I went by my house.
- Mm.

There were...

480

clothes and suitcases everywhere, so...

481
00:26:52,542 --> 00:26:55,113
I figure maybe they left in a hurry.

482
00:26:58,115 --> 00:27:02,584
I was hoping they fled
somewhere, you know, early on,

483
00:27:02,586 --> 00:27:04,756
but then I went by St. Vincent's to...

484
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:12,694
check the records.

485
00:27:12,696 --> 00:27:15,463
There were piles of them,

486
00:27:15,465 --> 00:27:17,606
just mounds of paper sitting on a gurney.

487
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:28,309
[Voice breaking] It was so surreal,

488
00:27:28,311 --> 00:27:30,648
seeing their names there on that paper.

489
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,751

00:27:36,753 --> 00:27:40,955
I don't know what I expected...

491
00:27:40,957 --> 00:27:42,857
You know, why...

492
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:46,194
why I'd be special,

493
00:27:46,196 --> 00:27:49,964
why I'd be spared.

MacDowell: And let me
tell you something else...

496
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,956
we are more than just survivors!

497
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:30,527
- [Cheers and applause]
- We are more than our grief,

498
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:32,829
we are more than our loss,

499
00:28:32,831 --> 00:28:35,098
and we are more than our pain!

500
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,567
- [Cheers and applause]
- [Chuckles] Yeah.

501
00:28:37,569 --> 00:28:39,703
We were spared for a reason.

502
00:28:39,705 --> 00:28:42,672
We were spared because
we were put on this earth

503
00:28:42,674 --> 00:28:44,608
to do something more!

504
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:47,611
[Cheers and applause]

00:28:47,613 --> 00:28:50,714
We were spared because we're special...

[Cheers and applause]

507
00:28:52,317 --> 00:28:57,154
...because we are the rightful
inheritors of the earth.

00:28:59,124 --> 00:29:01,324
This is our destiny...

[Laughs]

511
00:29:03,462 --> 00:29:05,362
...because we are the chosen!

him all over the country,

515

like missionaries.

516

We are the chosen!

Come on, kids.

00:29:31,323 --> 00:29:33,423
Jed: It's all right.

520
00:29:33,425 --> 00:29:35,492
Now, remember what your father said...

521
00:29:35,494 --> 00:29:38,755
one duffel bag's worth.

522
00:30:38,957 --> 00:30:41,691
Tex: They could still be out there.

523
00:30:41,693 --> 00:30:45,495
You were a cop, right, a detective?

524
00:30:45,797 --> 00:30:49,299
So, I should just abandon the mission,

525
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:51,868
C.O., and the crew?

526
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,271
The captain would understand. Talk to him.

527
00:30:54,273 --> 00:30:57,007
He knew his family was alive,

528
00:30:57,009 --> 00:31:00,510
and he turned away to serve the mission.

529
00:31:00,512 --> 00:31:02,812
Lost his wife because of it.

530
00:31:02,814 --> 00:31:05,282
I can't bring this to him.

531
00:31:05,284 --> 00:31:08,255
You want to stay.

532
00:31:12,257 --> 00:31:15,792
I want a lot of things.

533
00:31:15,794 --> 00:31:18,895
Chandler: I've been doing a lot
of thinking, about everything.

534
00:31:18,897 --> 00:31:22,766
There's some stuff I didn't tell you,

535
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:25,802
some things that happened to our
crew while we were out at sea.

536
00:31:25,804 --> 00:31:30,540
There are people out there
who want the cure so badly,

537
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:33,810
they're willing to do anything
for it, including kill.

538
00:31:33,912 --> 00:31:36,179
As long as <i>Nathan James</i>

539
00:31:36,181 --> 00:31:38,682
is leading the mission to spread the cure,

540
00:31:38,684 --> 00:31:41,918
our ship will be a target.

541
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,688
And it is not a safe place for you.

542
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,856
And I can't put my crew in a position

543
00:31:46,858 --> 00:31:49,192
where my own judgment might be affected

544
00:31:49,194 --> 00:31:51,795
because I'm thinking
about how to protect you

545
00:31:51,797 --> 00:31:53,229
instead of the mission.

546
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:54,531
So, you're leaving us?

547
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:57,835
No. Absolutely not.

548
00:31:58,637 --> 00:32:00,804
I'm resigning my commission.

549
00:32:00,806 --> 00:32:03,940
I'm gonna stay here with you.

550
00:32:03,942 --> 00:32:06,142
There's plenty I can do for
the cause here on the ground,

551
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:09,212
and I'm not gonna leave you again.

552
00:32:09,214 --> 00:32:12,749
It's a promise I made to you,
and I'm not gonna break it.

553
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:15,185
So, we're staying here in the house.

554
00:32:15,187 --> 00:32:16,419
Well, the gennies are up,

555
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:18,688
S.E.A.L.s will be here
soon to secure the area,

556
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,690
the whole town's getting cleaned up,

557
00:32:20,692 --> 00:32:23,360
and with the cure now...

558
00:32:23,362 --> 00:32:26,096
It's time to rebuild.

559
00:32:26,098 --> 00:32:28,031
We'll be safe here.

560
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:30,900
Sounds like your mind is made up.

561
00:32:30,902 --> 00:32:32,068
It is.

562
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:37,941
Well, I guess we should
start to unpack, then.

563
00:32:37,943 --> 00:32:39,118
[Sighs]

564
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,053
Mom would never have
wanted you to come home

565
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,621
before you finished your mission.

566
00:32:51,623 --> 00:32:55,299
- Ashley...
- She wouldn't have wanted you to give up.

567
00:33:05,287 --> 00:33:08,155
<i>[Rock music plays]</i>

568
00:33:08,157 --> 00:33:11,860
[Cheers and applause]

569
00:33:13,162 --> 00:33:16,497
Let's hear it for O'Connor
for getting the power back on!

570
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:20,000
[Cheers and applause]

571
00:33:20,002 --> 00:33:22,470
- Thank you very much.
- [Chuckles]

572
00:33:22,472 --> 00:33:24,672
Let's go, Romeo. Let's go.

573
00:33:24,674 --> 00:33:26,707
- We got to be going, Mom.
- I know you do.

574
00:33:26,709 --> 00:33:29,577
Just tell me you won't be living in
this bowling alley when I get back.

575
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:31,879
I think I'll go home.

576
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:33,647
Might have left a mess there, if I recall.

577
00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:36,319
- You did.
- [Both laugh]

578
00:33:38,821 --> 00:33:41,555
I am so proud of you.

579
00:33:41,557 --> 00:33:43,891
You too, Mom.

580
00:33:43,893 --> 00:33:48,195
You too.

581
00:33:48,197 --> 00:33:49,997
Ma'am...

582
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:53,434
It was very nice to meet you.

583
00:33:53,436 --> 00:33:56,771
You take care of my girl.

584
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:59,576
And the baby.

585
00:34:01,778 --> 00:34:05,045
You think I don't see?

586
00:34:05,047 --> 00:34:07,982
I'm your mother.

587
00:34:07,984 --> 00:34:09,617
I'll be back in a month,

588
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:12,051
six weeks tops.

589
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,526
Gonna be puttering around all day?

590
00:34:49,528 --> 00:34:52,163
Just getting the place in order. [Sighs]

591
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:57,501
Well, I thought you might
just be, uh, procrastinating...

592
00:34:57,503 --> 00:34:59,937
...'cause you don't know
how to go back to the ship

593
00:34:59,939 --> 00:35:03,676
and tell that crew of
yours that you're quitting.

594
00:35:05,678 --> 00:35:07,244
Do you not realize that they...

595
00:35:07,246 --> 00:35:09,480
that they can't do it without you?

596
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,716
What kind of message are
you gonna send to them,

597
00:35:12,718 --> 00:35:14,885
that you're, uh, George Washington

598
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:18,288
and you've come back to work on your farm?

599
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:21,258
You think because you got
a... a lab in Baltimore

600
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,160
and six planes with the cure

601
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:26,296
that everything's in hand?

602
00:35:26,298 --> 00:35:30,001
The world is in chaos.

603
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,136
There's a lot more to do.

604
00:35:32,138 --> 00:35:34,671
And that crew is trained to
do it, with or without me.

605
00:35:34,673 --> 00:35:37,541
- They need you.
- And <i>they</i> don't?

606
00:35:37,543 --> 00:35:39,843
And what if I don't come back?

607
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:42,112
I'm gonna make my kids orphans?

608
00:35:42,114 --> 00:35:44,081
You think you're the first soldier

609
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,483
that had trouble leaving
their family behind?

610
00:35:46,485 --> 00:35:48,252
[Sighs] Huh?

611
00:35:48,254 --> 00:35:50,587
During World War II, English naval captains

612
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:54,224
put their wives and
children in bunkers in London

613
00:35:54,226 --> 00:35:59,930
and went back out to sea to
fight the Nazis <i>for years.</i>

614
00:35:59,932 --> 00:36:04,068
Wives and children, Dad.

615
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,308
The wives were there.

616
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,077
I know you,

617
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,012
and I know you're beating yourself up,

618
00:36:15,014 --> 00:36:18,515
but if you're looking for someone to blame,

619
00:36:18,517 --> 00:36:21,218
blame me.

620
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,254
I should have never
let her go to that town.

621
00:36:24,256 --> 00:36:26,190
So cut the shit

622
00:36:26,192 --> 00:36:28,792
and quit laying this
guilt trip on yourself.

623
00:36:28,794 --> 00:36:32,029
There's no time for it.

624
00:36:32,031 --> 00:36:34,231
Whether you like it or not,

625
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,767
you're Noah and that ship is your ark.

626
00:37:10,649 --> 00:37:13,029
[Indistinct shouting]

627
00:38:32,031 --> 00:38:35,932
I told your mother we would
not be here without you.

628
00:38:35,934 --> 00:38:38,406
That's still true.

629
00:38:42,408 --> 00:38:45,542
These were given to me by the
captain on the <i>Pinckney</i>

630
00:38:45,544 --> 00:38:47,744
after my tour in Iraq.

631
00:38:47,746 --> 00:38:50,047
Sir, I... I... I... I can't.

632
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:54,484
Those words are not spoken around here.

633
00:38:54,486 --> 00:38:56,720
I'm promoting you to full lieutenant

634
00:38:57,022 --> 00:39:01,792
for your valor...

635
00:39:01,794 --> 00:39:03,660
...for your loyalty.

636
00:39:03,662 --> 00:39:06,463
Attention to promotion.

637
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:08,417
Lieutenant Foster.

638
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:17,721
Raise your right hand and repeat after me.

639
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:21,057
I, Alisha M. Granderson...

640
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,959
I, Alisha M. Granderson...

641
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:25,228
- ...do solemnly swear...
...Do solemnly swear...

642
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,830
...that I will support and defend

643
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:29,199
the constitution of the United States.

644
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:30,434
...that I will support and defend

645
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:33,281
the constitution of the United States.

646
00:39:44,283 --> 00:39:49,853
You don't have to say anything.

647
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:55,158
I'm glad you're still with us, Mike.

648
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,662
You didn't think about staying with them?

649
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:02,635
It's all I thought about.

650
00:40:05,037 --> 00:40:07,611
You mean I could have had my first command?

651
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:17,280
Chandler: There's a vacant
house right next to mine.

652
00:40:17,282 --> 00:40:22,152
The S.E.A.L.s will be there,
guarding the area, rebuilding.

653
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:24,120
My father will be there.

654
00:40:24,192 --> 00:40:26,293
That'll be good for the
children, to be so close.

655
00:40:26,295 --> 00:40:28,028
And, of course, I'll look in on them.

656
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,496
Thank you.

657
00:40:29,498 --> 00:40:31,468
Means a lot.

658
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,816
Be safe.

659
00:40:36,818 --> 00:40:38,341
You too.

660
00:41:01,343 --> 00:41:05,945
Talking about a Navy ship
came home with a cure,

661
00:41:05,947 --> 00:41:09,783
about planes flying across
the country with scientists.

662
00:41:09,785 --> 00:41:11,551
I don't understand.

663
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,253
How are you hearing this?

664
00:41:13,255 --> 00:41:16,222
I told you before, Curtis,
we have people everywhere.

665
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:19,192
Well, there have been a lot of
rumors floating around like that.

666
00:41:19,194 --> 00:41:20,927
None of them have ever been right.

667
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:23,897
It's not a rumor.

668
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:26,901
Who's that?

669
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:28,968
What did he say?

670
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:30,570
The ship with a cure...

671
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,939
it is not a rumor.

672
00:41:32,941 --> 00:41:36,042
The only question is, uh,

673
00:41:36,044 --> 00:41:39,045
what are you prepared to do about it?

674
